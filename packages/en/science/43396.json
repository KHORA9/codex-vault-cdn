Theirs is that kind of beauty which\r\nborders on the sublime, and which impresses us so powerfully in the\r\nOcean. And, like the Ocean, they awake in the soul the feeling of\r\ninfinity. They render it forgetful of the tumultuous regions which are\r\nperturbed by petty passions, and vexed by the contentions of ephemeral\r\ninterests, and transport it to the boundless space and the eternal\r\nspheres, or allow it to draw back within itself and muse upon its future\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nFinally, what grave problems does the Desert place before the man of\r\nscience! And first, why do life and fertility prevail elsewhere,--here,\r\nsterility and death? Why does an irrevocable curse seem to weigh upon\r\ncertain parts of the world, while others rejoice in Nature's fairest\r\ngifts? It is by examining the constitution of the soil and the character\r\nof the climate that we discover the key to this enigma, and recognize in\r\nthis apparent anomaly a necessary effect of the harmonious laws of the\r\nuniverse. Then the Desert has a geology and a meteorology of its own; is\r\nthe theatre of special phenomena, which we do not observe in more\r\nfavoured regions. Life itself is not completely absent from it;\r\nspecimens of the organic kingdoms are rare, no doubt, but for this very\r\nreason are the more interesting.\r\n\r\nAnd if, from the Desert properly so called, we pass to those countries\r\nwhere the genial air and the abundant waters favour the action of the\r\nproductive forces, the interest increases with the increasing\r\ndevelopment of life. The picture changes every moment, and every moment\r\ngrows more animated. The scenes of the savage world unfold before our\r\neyes like a moving panorama; unexpected incidents and dramatic episodes\r\nmultiply one upon another. Every region appears before us with its\r\nprimitive aspect, its grand and picturesque landscapes, its\r\ncharacteristic fauna and flora--frequently, also, with its tribes of\r\nwhite, or tawny, or black, or copper-coloured men, whose singular\r\nmanners, brutal instincts, fierce passions, and wretched condition\r\noffer, in all its mournful reality, the spectacle of that \"state of\r\nnature\" celebrated by a great writer as the ideal of virtue and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo conclude: the task which I here pursue is the same which I recently\r\ncommenced by the publication of my \"Mysteries of the Ocean;\"[1] to\r\ninvite and prepare the general reader and the young for the study of the\r\nphysical and natural sciences, by bringing before them the most\r\ninteresting results of the discoveries and the observations with which\r\nthese sciences have been enriched. Only, this new essay is entirely\r\ndescriptive, and has no didactic pretensions. I have contented myself\r\nwith sketching the physiognomy of the great regions not yet conquered by\r\ncivilization, with indicating the more remarkable features they present,\r\nthe peoples by whom they are inhabited, and the important plants and\r\nanimals they nourish.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n[The TRANSLATOR has only to add, that he has made copious additions to\r\nthe original work, with the view of rendering its scope more\r\ncomprehensive and complete, and of adapting it specially to the\r\nrequirements of the English reader.

There you may\r\nfollow with entranced vision the swooping wing of the lammergeyer; or\r\ntrace the nimble feet of the shy chamois; or, like Manfred, muse and\r\nwonder, while\r\n\r\n                \"The sunbow's rays still arch\r\n    The torrent with the many hues of heaven,\r\n    And roll the sheeted silver's waving column\r\n    O'er the crag's headlong perpendicular.\"\r\n\r\nMayhap, if favoured by Fortune, you may even find yourself face to face,\r\nin the abrupt bend of some obscure ravine, with a bear, which, calm and\r\nunsuspicious, looks on as you pass by, as if he were ignorant of men,\r\nand had never heard the ringing echoes of the hunter's rifle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PYRENEAN LANDSCAPE.]\r\n\r\nIt is less easy--in France, at least--to discover the old shadowy,\r\nleafy, almost impervious forest. The most celebrated--that of\r\nFontainebleau--despite its enormous trees, its rudely broken surface,\r\nits stags and roebucks reserved for imperial sport, despite its few\r\nadders and problematical vipers, is now little better than a rendezvous\r\nfor amateur artists and listless idlers. Its well-kept avenues resound\r\nwith rapid wheels, and you can scarcely stir a step without finding the\r\nassociations of the place interrupted by the stalls of vendors of cakes\r\nor the apparatus of itinerant gamblers. This profanation is surely to be\r\nregretted, for the Forest exhibits many landscapes of surpassing\r\ninterest, as the rocks of Franchart, the glens of Apremont, and, above\r\nall, that Sahara in miniature, the sands of Arbonne. Nor would one\r\nwillingly forget the historical memories which immortalize the famous\r\npalace where Francis I. received his after-time conqueror, Charles V.;\r\nwhere the wayward and half-insane Christina of Sweden listened with\r\ncruel delight to the groans of the murdered Monaldeschi; where Madame Du\r\nBarry lavished her shameless graces; where Pope Pius VII. lingered\r\nthrough two years of gilded captivity; and where Napoleon bade farewell\r\nto his dreams of universal empire.[3]\r\n\r\nAmong the uncultivated regions of France we may mention the marshes of\r\nthe Bresse, of Forez, of the Sologne, of Upper Brittany, and of Picardy.\r\nThe greater portion of these marshes, owing to the peat which forms\r\ntheir bed, is vigorously and not unsuccessfully worked. They are\r\ntraversed by trenches dug at right angles, and on whose border are\r\nplaced the turf-cutter's little hut, and the furnace in which the peat\r\nis baked. Their lagoons, and the canals which connect them, swarm with\r\nflat-bottomed boats. Man, in a word, has taken possession of them;\r\nbraving the unhealthy vapours which enfeeble his frame and shorten his\r\nlife, he builds his squalid abode on the rising ground left uncovered by\r\nthe waters. The largest of these peat-bogs are those of Montoir and the\r\nGrand Brière, near Savenay, in the department of the Loire Inférieure.\r\nThey occupy a considerable area of a vast desolate plain, where a few\r\nlean sheep crop an insufficient food from the scanty herbage, and whose\r\nsole product is turf. \"This country,\" says Jules Janin,[4] \"has no other\r\nharvest, no other wealth than its peat; neither fruit, nor flowers, nor\r\ncorn, nor pastures, nor repose, nor well-being; the earth is wild, the\r\nsky one of iron. It is a region of stagnant waters, pestiferous\r\nexhalations, decrepit men, famished animals.\"\r\n\r\nThe swampy levels of Montoir form the natural vestibule to the Armorican\r\nPeninsula, which of all the French provinces has the longest and the\r\nmost vigorously withstood the advance of civilization, its ideas, and\r\nits modern institutions, and has the most rigidly preserved its\r\nprimitive character. There are many nooks and corners in Brittany\r\nscarcely changed in outward aspect or inner life since the remote days\r\nwhen it was a valued appanage of the English crown. They seem to have\r\nbeen plunged in a sleep of centuries, from which the shrill whistle of\r\nthe steam-engine is only just awakening them. The country is undulating\r\nand broken; in the central districts it assumes quite a mountainous\r\ncharacter. It is true that its heights are only of moderate elevation,\r\nthe loftiest not exceeding 2000 feet; but they are barren, rude, and\r\nsombre in appearance. The coast is picturesque enough to delight the\r\nmost zealous artist, bordered with high and abrupt cliffs, and lined, as\r\nit were, with a beach where the waters of the Channel ever break in\r\nfloods of spray and foam, and where masses of rock lie scattered of\r\nimmense size and the most fantastic forms.\r\n\r\nGeologically speaking, Brittany may be regarded as a prolongation of our\r\nEnglish mountains, to which, like all the north-west coast of France,\r\nthey were anciently united. In some remote era a vast convulsion opened\r\nin the solid land a chasm through which the oceans poured their meeting\r\nwaters, and separated our beloved island from the European continent;\r\nthe sole condition under which, perhaps, it was possible for the English\r\npeople to have accomplished their destiny. Anchored amid the protecting\r\nseas, we are able to regard from afar, like a watchman from a tower, the\r\nconvulsions that sweep across the face of Europe. Like the watchman, we\r\ncannot refuse to be moved by the spectacle, by the stir and the tumult;\r\nbut it is only considerations of duty that can induce us to descend from\r\nour security, and mingle in the fray.\r\n\r\nBrittany belongs to what geologists call the primitive and intermediary\r\nformations. It is divided into three belts or longitudinal trenches:\r\nthose of the north and south consist of primitive rocks, granite and\r\nporphyry; the central appertains to a more recent formation, to the\r\ngroup of intermediary or secondary rocks, composed in the main of\r\nschists and mica-schists, quartz, and gneiss. Schist prevails over a\r\nconsiderable area, and is prolonged to the very extremity of the\r\npeninsula. These hard, compact, impervious rocks, are entirely bare in\r\nmany places; elsewhere, and over a great extent, they are covered but by\r\na thin layer of clayey and sandy earth, where the sudden slopes of the\r\nsoil do not allow the rains to settle.\r\n\r\nHere are the plains, often of considerable dimensions, which, bristling\r\nwith rocks, and broken up by ravines, water-courses, and marshes,\r\nconstitute the Landes of Brittany. True deserts these, relieved at\r\ndistant points by an isolated hut, or by a wandering herd of swine, lean\r\ncows, and meagre-looking horses, which obtain a scanty subsistence from\r\nthe heathery soil, sown here and there with tufts of furze, broom, and\r\nfern.\r\n\r\nUnder a sky of almost continual sombreness, like that which impends over\r\nthe pottery districts of England, these landes present a sufficiently\r\nsinister and uninviting aspect. The traveller, as he crosses their\r\nsepulchral wastes, will hardly marvel that they were anciently a chosen\r\nseat of Druidical worship. Like Dartmoor, they would seem to have\r\noffered a peculiarly fitting arena for the rites and ceremonies of a\r\ncreed which we know to have been mysterious in character and sanguinary\r\nin spirit. They are covered with its gray memorials: the masses of\r\ngranite of different shapes known as _Maen hirs_, or \"long stones,\" and\r\n_peulvens_, which appear to have been employed as sepulchral monuments;\r\n_dolmens_, or \"table-stones;\" and _cromlechs_ (_crom_, bowed or bending,\r\nand _lech_, a stone), which antiquaries are now agreed to regard as the\r\nremains of the ancient cemeteries or burial places. At Camae, near\r\nQuiberon Bay, may be seen a truly remarkable example of the\r\n_Parallelitha_, or avenues of upright stones, forming five parallel\r\nrows, which extend for miles over the dreary moorland. What were their\r\nuses it is impossible to determine, for there seems little ground to\r\nbelieve, as some writers would have us believe, that they were \"serpent\r\ntemples,\" where the old Ophite worship was celebrated. We can only gaze\r\nat them in wonder: mile upon mile of gray lichen-stained stones, some\r\ntwenty feet high, laboriously fashioned and raised in their present\r\nplaces by the hand of man some twenty centuries agone.[5]\r\n\r\nOn these very _dolmens_, where the priests of the Tentates were wont to\r\nimmolate their human victims to their unknown god, the mediæval\r\nsorcerers and sorceresses celebrated the Black Mass, or Mass of Satan,\r\nin terrible burlesque of the Roman Catholic sacrament, concocted their\r\nabominable philtres, and performed their dreary incantations. Alas for\r\nhuman nature! In every age it is a prey to the wildest credulity. Even\r\nin the present day more than one superstition hovers around the\r\nmonuments of the Celtic epoch. The Bretons believe them haunted by\r\ndemons called _poulpiquets_, who love to make sport of the passing\r\nstranger, but will sometimes give both counsel and encouragement to\r\nthose who know how to address them in the prescribed formulas; who, like\r\nthe Ladye in the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel,\" at their bidding can bow\r\n\r\n    \"The viewless forms of air.\"\r\n\r\nFor, in the Breton mind, the superstitions of Druidism have not been\r\nwholly uprooted by the teachings of Christianity, still less by those of\r\nscience and reason. Many a dark and dismal legend flourishes in the\r\nlonely recesses of the landes.[6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CELTIC MEMORIALS IN BRITTANY.]\r\n\r\nBrittany, like England, has its _Cornouaille_, or Cornwall, and it is\r\nhere, particularly in North Cornwall, that we see it under its most\r\ndesolate aspect, with its chains of black treeless hills covered with\r\nheath and furze; with its deserts of broom and fern, its ruins scattered\r\nalong the winding roads, its attenuated herds wandering at their will\r\nacross the moors, and its savage, ignorant, and scanty population. The\r\nBretons of Cornwall, according to a French writer, are elevated but a\r\nlittle above the true savage life. Those who dwell upon the coast live\r\non the products of their fishing, except when the fortunate occurrence\r\nof a wreck provides them with temporary abundance. At bottom, they\r\npossess the qualities and defects of characters strongly tempered, but\r\nabsolutely uncultivated. They are as hard and bare as their own granite\r\nrocks. Persevering, courageous, resolute, they make excellent sailors,\r\nthe best which France can find; the sea is for them a second country.\r\nProgress, which they do not understand, inspires them with a sort of\r\nterror, a gloomy mistrust. When the railway surveyors first intruded\r\nupon their solitudes, these rigid conservatives assailed them with\r\nvolleys of stones, and when the railroads were laid down flung beams\r\nacross the lines to overthrow the hissing, whirring trains which\r\nthreatened to disturb their prescriptive barbarism. They asked but to be\r\nlet alone--to be suffered to live as their forefathers lived--to be\r\nspared the ingenuities, successes, vices, and virtues of the New World.\r\nBut modern civilization, like Thor's hammer, or Siegfried's magic sword\r\nBalmung, will break down the last barriers raised by ignorance and\r\nsuperstition. It will shed its light upon the wilds and wastes of\r\nBrittany, and compel their inhabitants in the course of years to\r\nacknowledge its value and accept its benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE LANDES OF GASCONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Breton \"Cornwall\" has been called by a popular French writer, \"the\r\nArabia Petrea of Brittany.\" But we might, perhaps, with greater justice\r\napply to this sombre region, peopled as it is with fantastic visions,\r\nthe name of \"Land of Fear,\" which the Arabs bestow on the Great Desert.\r\nLess vivid, it may be, but graver and more profound is the impression\r\nproduced by the Landes and Dunes of Gascony. These deserts of the south,\r\nwhich Michelet terms \"the vestibule and threshold of the Ocean,\" appeal\r\nless powerfully to the imagination. They are haunted by no historical\r\nmemories, no traditions or marvellous legends in which man has rudely\r\nembodied his dim conceptions of the mysteries of nature; they are\r\ncrowded with no monuments of antiquity to revive the shadows of the\r\nheroes and priests of ancient Gaul; and when these are wanting, what\r\nshall supply their place? But ample scope exists for the assiduous\r\nlabours of the naturalist, who here may see at work those unresting\r\nforces which have inspired every revolution of the globe's surface; who\r\nmay contemplate here the phenomena that occur with the same regularity\r\nas in the days when man had not been fashioned after his Maker's image--\r\n\r\n    \"Him framing like himself, all shining bright;\r\n     A little living sun, son of the living light.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThese despoiled plains, these inhospitable wilds, alternately dry and\r\nmarshy; these sullen pools, these mountains of shifting sand, speak\r\nforcibly to his mind of their past history, which is not one of the\r\nleast curious episodes of the history of the physical world.\r\n\r\nThe department which borrows its name from the Landes of Gascony is\r\ndivided by the Adour into two wholly dissimilar parts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHEPHERDS OF THE LANDES.]\r\n\r\nTo the south of the river lies a rich, undulating, vine-bearing country,\r\nrich in pasturage and harvest, sown with pleasant villages and smiling\r\ncountry houses, and watered by full streams and little rivers. To the\r\nnorth, the appearance of the country changes abruptly. When the\r\ntraveller has crossed the alluvial zone of the Adour he sees before him\r\na thin, dry, sandy level of a comparatively recent marine formation. Its\r\nonly products are rye, millet, and maize; its only vegetation, forests\r\nof pines and scattered coppices of oaks; beyond these, and they do not\r\nextend far, all cultivation ceases, and the soil is stripped of verdure;\r\nyou enter upon the Landes--seemingly vast as a sea--occupied by\r\npermanent or periodical swamps; and where, over a space of several\r\nsquare leagues, in an horizon apparently boundless, you perceive nothing\r\nbut heaths, sheepfolds or steadings for the flocks of sheep that\r\ntraverse these deserts, and shepherds keeping mute watch over their\r\nanimals, living wholly among them, and having no intercourse with the\r\nrest of humanity, except when once a week they seek their masters'\r\nhouses to procure their supply of provisions. It is these shepherds only\r\n(_Landescots_ and _Aouillys_), and not, as is generally supposed, all\r\nthe peasants of the Landes, who are perched upon stilts, so as to survey\r\nfrom afar their wandering flocks, and to traverse more safely the\r\nmarshes which frequently lie across their path.\r\n\r\nWild and uncouth are the figures which these stilt-walkers present, as\r\nthey move rapidly over the country, often at the rate of six or seven\r\nmiles an hour; occasionally indulging in an interval of rest, by the aid\r\nof a third wooden support at the back (curved at the top, so as to fit\r\nthe hollow of the body), while they pursue their favourite pastime of\r\nknitting. The dress of the Landescot is singularly rude. His coat or\r\npaletôt is a fleece; cuisses and greaves of the same material protect\r\nhis legs and thighs; his feet are thrust into sabots and coarse woollen\r\nsocks, which cover only the heels and instep. Over his shoulder hangs\r\nthe gourd which contains his week's store of provisions: some mouldy\r\nrye-bread, a few sardines, some onions and cloves of garlic, and a flask\r\nof thin sour wine. From sunrise to sunset he lives upon the stilts,\r\nnever touching the ground. Sometimes he drives his flock home at\r\neventide; sometimes he bivouacs _sub jove frigido_, under the cold\r\nheaven of night. Unbuckling his stilts, and producing his flint and\r\nsteel, he soon kindles a cheery fire of fir-branches, and gathering his\r\nsheepskins round him, composes himself to sleep; his only annoyances\r\nbeing the musquitoes, and his fears of the evil tricks of wizard or\r\nwitch, who may peradventure catch a glimpse of him in the moonlight, as\r\nthey ride past on their besom to some unholy gathering or demon-dance.\r\n\r\nAn English traveller has sketched in vivid colours the landscape of the\r\nLandes. Over all its gloom and barrenness, he remarks, over all its\r\n\"blasted heaths,\" its monotonous pine-woods, its sudden morasses, its\r\nglaring sand-heaps, prevails a strong sense of loneliness, a grandeur\r\nand intensity of desolation, which invests the scene with a sad, solemn\r\npoetry peculiar to itself. Emerging from the black shadows of the\r\nforest, the pilgrim treads a plain, \"flat as a billiard-table,\"\r\napparently boundless as the ocean, clad in one unvaried, unbroken garb\r\nof dusky heath. Sometimes stripes and ridges, or great ragged patches of\r\nsand, glisten in the fervid sunshine; sometimes belts of scraggy young\r\nfir trees appear rising from the horizon on the right, and sinking into\r\nit again on the left. Occasionally a brighter shade of green, with\r\njungles of willows and water weeds, giant rushes, and \"clustered marish\r\nmosses,\" will tell of the \"blackened waters\" beneath--\r\n\r\n    \"Hard by a poplar shook alway,\r\n        All silver-green with gnarlèd bark;\r\n        For leagues no other tree doth mark\r\n     The level waste, the rounding gray.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe dwellings which stud this dreary, yet not wholly unpoetic landscape,\r\nare generally mere isolated huts, separated oftentimes by many miles.\r\nRound them spreads a miserable field or two, planted with such crops as\r\nmight be expected on a poor soil and from deficient cultivation. The\r\ncottages are mouldering heaps of sod and unhewn and unmortared stones,\r\nclustered round with ragged sheds composed of masses of tangled bushes,\r\npine-stakes and broad-leaved reeds, beneath which the meagrest looking\r\ncattle conceivable find a precarious shelter.[9]\r\n\r\nThe Landes are divided into the Little Landes, near Mont-de-Marsan; and\r\nthe Great Landes, stretching to the north and west of the department of\r\nwhich that town is the capital, and uniting uninterruptedly with those\r\nthat occupy the vast country situated south of the Gironde. The total\r\nsuperficial area of these plains is estimated at upwards of 2,400,000\r\nacres, of which two-thirds belong to the department of the Landes, and\r\nthe remainder to that of the Gironde.\r\n\r\nYet the reader must not believe this country to be a desert in the\r\npopular acceptation of the word; it has its forests of pines, where the\r\nextraction and preparation of resinous matter are carried on with\r\nconsiderable activity. It has its small towns, its pretty villages, its\r\nfactories, and even its handsome villas. Finally, modern industry has\r\ncut the Landes in two by the Bordeaux railway, which traverses them from\r\nnorth to south, and bifurcates at Morans to throw off a line to Bayonne,\r\nand another to Tarbes.\r\n\r\nIn shape, the Great Landes may be compared to an immense rectangular\r\ntriangle, having for its base the coast, which, from the mouth of the\r\nGironde to Bayonne, or for a length of more than sixty leagues, is\r\nalmost rectilineal. But they are separated from the sea by a long\r\nparallel chain of lakes and water-courses--a waste of shallow pools--a\r\nlabyrinth of gulfs and morasses, and then by the continuous chain of the\r\nDunes, of which we shall speak in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nThat which is commonly called the Great Lande is bounded on the north by\r\nthe _étang_, or lake, of Cazau. It is a sandy, treeless plain, and upon\r\nwhich, for a traject of several leagues from east to west, not one\r\nhabitation worthy of the name is perceptible until the traveller arrives\r\nat Mimizan, near the southern point of the lake of Aureilhan. This lake\r\non the south-west pours its waters into the sea. To the north it\r\ncommunicates, through the canal of St. Eulalie, with the lake of\r\nBiscarosse, which is itself connected with that of Cazau. East of this\r\nchain of lakes lies the Lande; west of it stretches the range of\r\n_Dunes_, or sand-hills.\r\n\r\nThe lake or pool of Cazau is a small sea of fresh water, perfectly\r\nclear, profoundly deep, and fourteen to fifteen thousand acres in\r\nextent. It has its whirlwinds and its tempests, so that in certain\r\nseasons it is perilous to embark on its surface. And were its banks\r\nclothed with rich woods, or raised aloft in irregular or precipitous\r\ncliffs, it would surely attract as great a throng of tourists as the\r\nmountain-tarns and lochs of Scotland or Cumberland, or the Arcadian\r\nwaters of Northern Italy. The lake of Biscarosse, in form a triangle,\r\nwith one side formed by the Dunes, covers about twelve thousand acres.\r\nIt derives its name from a village situated at its northern angle, on\r\nthe bank of the canal which connects it with the lake of Cazau. The lake\r\nof Aureilhan is the smallest of the three; the St. Eulalie canal, which\r\nlinks it to the preceding, traverses a series of peat-bogs bounded\r\neastward by gloomy pine-forests, and westward by the interminable Dunes,\r\nwhich, by arresting the flow of the rain-waters, have really created\r\nthese so-called lakes and extensive swamps. Enormous quantities of rain\r\nfall every year in the Landes,--which district the Romans would\r\ncertainly have dedicated to Jupiter Pluvius,--and find beneath the thin\r\nsuperficial stratum or crust of sand and earth, a sub-soil of _tufa_ and\r\n_allios_--in other words, of compact chalk and sand agglutinated by a\r\nferruginous sediment. Frequently this _tufa_ possesses all the hardness\r\nof stone, and its imperviousness is its fundamental property. Hence it\r\nfollows, that a portion of the heavy annual rainfall remains in the\r\nreceptacles provided by the hollows and depressions of the soil, and in\r\ndue time accumulates into marshes and lagoons, until gradually\r\nevaporated by the heat of spring.\r\n\r\nWhen of old the scared peasants beheld the irresistible advance of these\r\nstrange ministers of destruction, they had no other resource than to\r\nfell their woods, abandon their dwellings, and surrender their \"little\r\nall\" to the pitiless sand and devouring sea. What could avail against\r\nsuch a scourge? Efforts were made to repel it. It is said that\r\nCharlemagne, during a brief residence in the Landes, on his return from\r\nhis expedition against the Saracens, employed his veterans, and expended\r\nlarge sums of money in preserving the cities of the coast from imminent\r\nruin; but whether the means employed were insufficient, or whether the\r\nimperial resources failed, and other urgent needs diverted the\r\npopulation and their leaders from this struggle against nature, the\r\nworks were wholly abandoned.\r\n\r\nOf late years they have been resumed, and with greater success, by a\r\nskilful agriculturist, M. Desbiey, of Bordeaux, and an able engineer, M.\r\nBremontier, who have called in nature herself to assist man in his war\r\nagainst nature. Their system consists of sowing in the driest sand the\r\nseeds of the sea-pine, mixed with those of the broom (_genista\r\nscoparia_), and the _psamma arenaria_. The spaces thus sown are then\r\nclosely covered with branches to protect them from the action of the\r\nwinds. These seeds germinate spontaneously. The brooms, which spring up\r\nrapidly, restrain the sand, while sheltering the young pines, and\r\nthenceforth the Dune ceases to move, because the wind can no longer\r\nunsettle its substance, and the grains are held together by the roots of\r\nthe young plants. The work is always begun on the inland side, in order\r\nto protect the farmer and the peasant, and to withdraw the infant forest\r\nfrom the unwholesome influence of the ocean-winds. And, in order that\r\nthe sown spaces shall not themselves be buried under the sands blown up\r\nfrom the shore, a palisade of wicker-work is raised at a suitable\r\ndistance, which, reinforced by young plants of sandwort (_psamma\r\narenaria_), check the moving sands for a sufficiently long time to\r\nfavour the development of the seeds. Finally, the work is completed by\r\nthe construction of a substantial wall, or rather an artificial cliff,\r\nwhich effectually prevents the further progress of the flood, or directs\r\nit seaward, to be arrested on its course by the barrier of the\r\nsand-hills. Unable to force a passage through these natural ramparts,\r\nthey have excavated certain basins, more or less extensive, more or less\r\ndeep, which have formed into inland seas, communicating with the\r\nAtlantic by one narrow issue.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that, owing to the encroachment of the Dunes,\r\nthese lakes have been constantly forced back upon the inland country.\r\nFortunately, this menacing invasion of the sands has been checked by the\r\ngreat engineering works executed a few years ago; which, on the one\r\nhand, have fixed, and, as it were, solidified the Dunes, and, on the\r\nother, have provided for the regular outflow of the waters. The Landes\r\nhave thus been opened to the persevering labours of the cultivator. The\r\nculture of the pine, and the manufacture of resinous substances, have\r\nlargely extended, and the time, perhaps, is not far distant when these\r\ndeserts will almost completely disappear; when these desolate and\r\nunproductive plains will pleasantly bloom, transformed into shadowy\r\nwoods or verdurous meadows.[10]\r\n\r\nTo so fortunate a result nothing will more powerfully contribute than\r\nthe embankment of the Dunes. These have been, in reality, the true\r\nscourge of this country; these were the moving desert, the constantly\r\nascending sea, which had already engulfed forests, villages, even towns,\r\nunder its billows of sand, and driven before it the terrified\r\ninhabitants of the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE DUNES, OR SAND-HILLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dunes form the extreme line of the Brittany coast for nearly two\r\nhundred miles, from the Adour to the Garonne. They are hills of white\r\nsand, as fine and soft as if it had been sifted through an hour-glass.\r\nTheir outline, therefore, changes every hour. When the wind blows from\r\nthe land, millions of tons of sand are hourly driven into the sea, to be\r\nwashed up again on the beach and blown inland by the first Biscay gale.\r\nA water hurricane from the west will fill up with sand square miles\r\nof shallow lake, driving the displaced waters into the interior,\r\ndispersing them in shining pools among the \"murmurous pines,\" flooding\r\nand frequently destroying the scattered hamlets of the people, and\r\ninundating their fields of rye and millet.[11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FLOOD IN BRITTANY.]\r\n\r\nTheir origin is due to the prevalence of the sea-winds on those points\r\nof the coast which are not protected by rock and cliff, and whose slopes\r\nof sand descend very gradually to the margin of the waves. Their\r\nformation is easily explained. The sand of which they are composed is a\r\nsilicious material, reduced to minute grains, generally rounded, by\r\ntrituration. These grains, nevertheless, are often too big and too heavy\r\nfor the wind to take them up and scatter them afar, like the dust of the\r\nhighways or the ashes of volcanoes. But at low tide the sand, dried by\r\nthe sun's rays and the action of the wind, offers to the latter a\r\nsufficient _holdfast_ to be dragged up the slopes which descend seaward,\r\nand deposited at a certain distance. This process being constantly\r\nrepeated, the heaps are daily increasing in dimensions.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be understood that this accumulation along the shore\r\ncannot have taken place where the force and direction of the sands\r\nexperience periodical or capricious changes; for then the sands cast\r\nupon the beach by the winds of the north and west would be driven back\r\ninto the sea by the winds of the south and east. This is noticeable in\r\nmany places where the nature of the coast is favourable for the\r\nproduction of such a phenomenon. But on other shores--as on the Atlantic\r\nlittoral of France--the winds which blow most frequently and most\r\nviolently are from the west and south-west. And it is there we encounter\r\nthe Dunes. Those of Gascony are by far the most remarkable. Northward,\r\nthey extend as far as the Point de Grave, which shuts in the mouth of\r\nthe Gironde; southward, to the bank of the Adour, and even further, to\r\nthe cliffs of Béarn. Here the basin of Arcachon constitutes one vast\r\nhollow; and some openings exist, moreover, in the department of Landes,\r\nbetween that basin and the Adour, for the overflow of the waters which\r\ndescend from the interior. To the north and south of the Teste de Buch\r\nthe chain of sand-hills measures from 4400 to 6600 feet in width. At\r\nother points it is still wider; but it narrows towards its extremities,\r\nand both at the Point de Grave and near Bayonne does not exceed 450\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nOwing to their extreme shiftiness of soil, the Dunes can attain no\r\nconsiderable elevation. The sand deposited by the wind on the summit of\r\nthe hill is always in a state of precarious equilibrium. It has a\r\nconstant tendency to be precipitated down the other side; and the higher\r\nthe summit the greater is this tendency, so that there comes at last a\r\nmoment when no further accumulation in height is possible. The Dune may\r\nthen extend its basis, may even increase twofold in dimensions, but it\r\nno longer rises.\r\n\r\nLet us note, moreover, that owing to its density the sand cannot be\r\ncarried even by the most violent winds into the higher regions of the\r\natmosphere; and that the Dunes, when they have reached a certain\r\nelevation, oppose to them an insuperable obstacle. This circumstance\r\nwould consequently have a salutary effect, and the accumulation of sand\r\nwould be determined by a law of its own, if the Dunes, once formed, had\r\ntime to cohere. But this is not the case. Incessantly does the wind undo\r\nor modify its work; and the loftiest hills being the most exposed to its\r\nviolence, are quickly reduced to the common level. In general, the\r\ngreatest elevation of the Dunes corresponds to their greatest breadth.\r\nThus the culminating point of those of Gascony is found in the belt\r\nsituated between the lakes of Cazau and Biscarosse, where the chain is\r\nfrom 7500 to 9000 yards across. Their average height is 180 feet to 200\r\nfeet above the sea-level; but some of the hills in the forest of\r\nBiscarosse attain an altitude of 320 feet. In the neighbourhood of the\r\nmouths of the Gironde and the Adour, where the chain is considerably\r\nnarrowed, the height of the Dunes is only thirty to forty-five feet.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not suppose that the Dunes consist of a single series of\r\nsand-hills ranged along the shore. He will, however, have conjectured,\r\nfrom our statements respecting their width, that they really compose a\r\nchain of several more or less regular ridges. The hills are separated\r\nfrom one another by valleys, locally named _laites_ or _lettes_. These\r\nvalleys, where the pluvial waters flow and accumulate, exhibit a\r\nstriking contrast, in their freshly-blooming verdure, to the naked,\r\nbarren Dunes. The general aspect of the landscape may, therefore, be\r\ncompared to that of the ocean. There is the same broken surface, the\r\nsame extent of undulation, the billows of sand being upheaved by the\r\nwind like the billows of the sea, and sharing in their mobility. You\r\nmust see, says a writer, in order to form an idea of those colossal\r\nmasses of fine sand, which the wind incessantly skims, and which travel\r\nin this way towards the inland country: you must see their contours so\r\nsoftened that they look like mountains of plaster of Paris polished by\r\nthe workman's hand, and their surface so mobile that a little insect\r\nleaves upon it a conspicuous track; their slopes, at every degree of\r\ninclination; their everlasting sterility--not a blade of grass, not an\r\natom of vegetation; their solitude, less imposing than that of the\r\nmountains, but still of a truly savage character. You must see, from the\r\nsummit of one of these ridges, the ocean on your right hand, and on your\r\nleft the extensive lakes which border the littoral; and, in the midst of\r\nthis tumultuous sea of tawny sand, green grassy valleys, rich and\r\nfertile pastures, smiling oases of verdure, where herds of horses graze,\r\nand cows half-wild, guarded by shepherds scarcely less wild than\r\nthey.[12]\r\n\r\nThe marked characteristic of the Dunes, as we have already said, is\r\ntheir mobility, which renders them a constant menace for the\r\nneighbouring populations. To the wind which creates them they owe their\r\nfrequent changes and their inland movement. While the sea eats into the\r\ncoast, assisted by the breezes which gradually sweep clear the ground\r\nbefore it, the Dunes extend, and drive before them the shallow lakes:\r\nthese in their turn encroach upon the Landes, and until now man has been\r\nconstrained to recoil, step by step, before his threefold enemy. It is\r\nin this phenomenon, rather than in the ungrateful soil of the Landes,\r\nthat we must seek the cause of the curse which has seemed so long to\r\nrest upon this country-side. You must go back some twenty centuries to\r\ntrace the origin of the Dunes of Gascony. Fourteen or fifteen hundred\r\nyears ago the coast north of the Adour was inhabited, and comparatively\r\nflourishing. Mimizan was then a town and a sea-port, from which were\r\nexported the resinous products of the neighbouring forests. The Normans\r\ndisembarked there on several occasions. Under its walls, in 506, was\r\nfought a great battle between the allied Goths and Ostrogoths on the one\r\nside, and the Béarnais, commanded by a bishop of Lescar, on the other.\r\nBoth town and port to-day are buried under the sands. \"Full fathom five\"\r\nlie church and convent, and the busy street, the noisy mart, and the\r\nonce peaceful home. The present village has nearly perished: the Dune\r\nwas not three yards from the church when its progress was recently\r\narrested. Other cities, laid down in old charts of the country, but of\r\nwhich not a trace remains, have in this manner disappeared, and entire\r\nforests have been ingulfed, now under the sands of the Dunes, now under\r\nthe sands and waves of the sea.\r\n\r\nSome parts of the chain have been rendered to a great extent immovable\r\nby the vegetation which has gradually covered them, and these have\r\nopposed a formidable obstacle to the encroachments of the sands. Yet\r\nhere and there the barrier has been defied. For example, in the forest\r\nof Biscarosse the movable Dunes, actually sweeping over the ancient\r\nhills, have not only filled up the valleys, but ingulfed a great number\r\nof pines, and raised themselves several yards above the crest of the\r\noldest trees, planted on the summit of the highest hills.\r\n\r\nIn whose favour, in this struggle of science against the elements, will\r\nthe victory eventually be decided? The question is one which the future\r\nalone can resolve.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWILD SCENES OF ENGLAND:--DARTMOOR AND THE FEN COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrossing the Channel, and surveying the limited expanse of our own\r\n\"beloved England,\" we become aware of certain districts which belong to\r\nthe Desert World. Through the ceaseless energy of our race, and the\r\nintroduction of mechanical inventions which economize time and labour\r\nand treble the reproductive power of capital, almost all England has\r\nbeen transformed into a rich and radiant garden, where the waste places\r\nare \"few and far between,\" where the solitude of desolation is scarcely\r\nknown; yet, as already observed, there are districts which retain much\r\nof their ancient wildness of character.\r\n\r\nSuch a region is Dartmoor, the extensive and romantic table-land of\r\ngranite which occupies the south-western part of the county of Devon. In\r\nits recesses still linger the eagle, the bustard, and the crane; its\r\nsolitudes are broken by the hoarse cries of the sparrow-hawk, the hobby,\r\nand the goshawk; and the Cyclopean memorials of Druidism which cover its\r\nsurface--cromlechs and kistvaens, tolmêns and stone-avenues--invest it\r\nwith a peculiar air of mysterious awe. It extends in length about\r\ntwenty-two miles (from north to south), and in breadth twenty miles\r\n(from east to west). Its total area exceeds 130,000 acres. It rises\r\nabove the surrounding country like \"the long, rolling waves of a\r\ntempestuous ocean, fixed into solidity by some instantaneous and\r\npowerful impulse.\" A natural rampart is cast around it. Deep ravines,\r\nwatered by murmuring streams, diversify its aspect, and lofty hills of\r\ngranite, locally called _tors_, of which the principal, Yes Tor, has an\r\nelevation of 2050 feet above the sea. Its soil is composed of peat, in\r\nsome places twenty-five feet deep; underneath which lies a solid mass\r\nof granite, occasionally relieved by trap (a volcanic rock), and\r\ntraversed by veins of tin, copper, and manganese.[14]\r\n\r\nNearly in the centre of this dismal wilderness lies an immense morass,\r\nwhose surface is in many places incapable of supporting the lightest\r\nanimal, and whose inexhaustible reservoirs supply the fountains of many\r\na river and stream--the Dart, the Teign, the Taw, the Tavy--all clear as\r\ncrystal in the summer months, but after heavy rains running redly\r\nthrough the \"stony vales.\" The roaring of these torrents, when angry and\r\nswollen, is sublime to a degree inconceivable by those who have never\r\nheard the wild impressive music of untamed Nature.\r\n\r\nThe tors are remarkable for their quaint fantastic outlines, which, like\r\nthe clouds, suggest all manner of strange similitudes--to dragons, and\r\ngriffins, and hoary ruins, and even to human forms of gigantic size,\r\napparently confronting the traveller as the lords and natural denizens\r\nof the rugged waste. The principal summits are Yes Tor, Cawsand Beacon,\r\nFur Tor, Lynx Tor, Rough Tor, Holne Ridge, Brent Tor, Rippen Tor, Hound\r\nTor, Sheep's Tor, Crockern Tor, and Great Mis Tor. Not only must their\r\nvariety of form delight the artist, but his eye rests well pleased on\r\ntheir manifold changes of colour; purple, and green, and gray, and\r\nblue--now softened by a delicate vaporous shadow, now glowing with\r\nintense fulness in the sun's unclouded light.\r\n\r\nDartmoor is traditionally reputed to have been anciently clothed with\r\nforest. The sole relic now existing is the lonely _Wistman's_ Wood,\r\nwhich occupies a sombre valley, bounded on the one side by Crockern Tor,\r\non the other by Little and Great Bairdown; the slopes being strewn with\r\ngray blocks of granite in \"admired disorder,\" as if the Titans had been\r\nat their cumbrous play. Starting from this chaos of rocks, appears a\r\nwood or grove of dwarf weird-looking oaks, interspersed with the\r\nmountain-ash, and everywhere festooned about and garlanded with ferns\r\nand parasitical plants. None of these trees exceed twelve feet in\r\nheight, but at the top they spread far and wide, and \"branch and twist\r\nin so fantastic and tortuous a manner as to remind one of those strange\r\nthings called mandrakes.\" Their branches are literally covered with ivy\r\nand creeping plants, and their trunks so thickly embedded in a coating\r\nof moss that at first sight, says Mrs. Bray, \"you would imagine them to\r\nbe of enormous thickness in proportion to their height. Their whole\r\nappearance conveys to you the idea of hoary age in the vegetable world\r\nof creation; and on visiting Wistman's Wood it is impossible to do other\r\nthan think of those 'groves in stony places' so often mentioned in\r\nScripture as being dedicated to Baal and Astaroth.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThat heathen rites were celebrated here in the pre-historic era seems\r\nvery probable, the best etymologists agreeing that the name is a\r\ncorruption of _Wise-man_, or _Wish-man_; that is, of the old Norse god\r\nWoden, who is still supposed to drive his spectral hounds across the\r\nsilent wastes of Dartmoor. Celtic or Cymric memorials, as we have\r\npreviously hinted, are very abundant and very various. There are\r\ncromlechs, where the Britons buried their dead; stone pillars, with\r\nwhich they commemorated their priests and heroes; avenues of upright\r\nstones leading up to the circles, where, perhaps, their priests\r\ncelebrated their religious rites; kistvaens, or stone-chests, containing\r\nthe body unburned; tolmêns, or holed stones, whose meaning cannot be\r\ndetermined, but which may probably have had some astronomical uses;\r\nbridges, huts, and walled villages, all bearing traces of the handiwork\r\nof our \"rude forefathers.\" There is no spot in England so thronged as\r\nthis with the shadows of a remote, a mysterious, and an irrecoverable\r\npast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Dartmoor our wanderings take us to the eastern coast, and the\r\ndistrict of THE FENS, now so rapidly yielding to the labour of the\r\nagriculturist as to exhibit but rare glimpses of their ancient\r\n\"savagery.\" It extends inland, around an arm of the North Sea called the\r\nWash, into the six counties of Cambridge, Huntingdon, Lincoln, Norfolk,\r\nNorthampton, and Suffolk, with an area of upwards of 420,000 acres.\r\nInland it is bounded by an amphitheatral barrier of high lands, and\r\ntouches the towns of Bolingbroke, Brandon, Earith, Milton, and\r\nPeterborough. Into this great basin flow the waters of the greater part\r\nof the drainage of nine counties, which gather into the rivers Cam,\r\nGlen, Lark, Nene, Great and Little Ouse, Stoke, and Welland, these being\r\nlinked together by a network of natural and artificial canals.\r\n\r\nAnciently, the Fens were pleasant to the eye of the lover of the\r\npicturesque; for they contained shining meres and golden reed-beds,\r\nhaunted by countless water-fowl, and strange, gaudy insects. \"Dark-green\r\nalders,\" says Kingsley,[16] \"and pale-green reeds stretched for miles\r\nround the broad lagoon, where the coot clanked and the bittern boomed,\r\nand the sedge-bird, not content with its own sweet song, mocked the\r\nnotes of all the birds around; while high overhead hung hawk beyond\r\nhawk, buzzard beyond buzzard, kite beyond kite, as far as eye could\r\nsee.\" What strange transformations must this wild region have undergone!\r\nThere was a time, in all probability, when a great part of the German\r\nOcean was dry land, through which, into a vast estuary between North\r\nBritain and Norway, flowed together all the rivers of North-eastern\r\nEurope--Elbe, Weser, Rhine, Scheldt, Seine, Thames, and all the rivers\r\nof east England, as far north as the Humber. Meanwhile, the valleys of\r\nthe Cam, the Ouse, the Nene, the Welland, the Glen, and the Witham, were\r\nslowly \"sawing themselves out\" by the quiet action of rain and rivers.\r\nThen came an age when the lowland was swept away by the biting,\r\ncorroding sea-wash still so powerfully destructive on the east coast of\r\nEngland, as far as Flamborough Head. \"Wave and tide by sea, rain and\r\nriver by land; these are God's mighty mills in which he makes the old\r\nworld new.\" And as Longfellow says of moral things, so may we of\r\nphysical,--\r\n\r\n  \"'Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small;\r\n   Though he sit and wait with patience, with exactness grinds he all.'\"\r\n\r\nThese ever-active causes have converted the dry land into the fens. The\r\nmud brought down by the rivers cannot get away to sea; and, with the\r\n_débris_ of the coast, is constantly swept southward by tide and\r\ncurrent, and deposited within the great curving basin of the Wash,\r\nbetween Lincolnshire and Norfolk. There it is kept by the strong barrier\r\nof shifting sands coming inwards from the sea; a barrier which also\r\nconfines the very water of the fens, and spreads it inland into a\r\nlabyrinth of streams, shallow meres, and bogs. The rainfall, over the\r\nwhole vast area of dull level, has found no adequate channels of escape\r\nfor centuries; and hence we may understand how peat--the certain product\r\nof standing water--has slowly overwhelmed the rich alluvium, and\r\nswallowed up gradually the stately forests of fir and oak, ash and\r\npoplar, hazel and yew, which once spread far and wide over the blooming\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n    \"Many a green isle needs must be\r\n     In the deep wide sea of misery,\"\r\n\r\nsings Shelley; and this dreary outcome of mudbank and bog and mere had\r\nits wooded isles, very fair and lovely to behold, redeeming the\r\ndesolation of the landscape. Such were Ramsey, Lindsey, Whittlesea,\r\nwhose names remind us of their whilome characteristics (_ea_, _ey_, an\r\nisland). In these green places the old monks loved to build their quiet\r\nabbeys, rearing their herds in rich pastures, feeding fat fish in their\r\ntranquil streams, and dreaming in the shadow of green alder and stately\r\nash.\r\n\r\nBut these Eden-isles were few, and the surrounding marsh was black and\r\ndismal enough to scare the boldest spirit, and pestilential enough to\r\nsap and undermine the strongest frame. The Romans had attempted to drain\r\nand embank it, and their _vallum_ may still be tracked along the surface\r\nof the marsh-lands, marked to this day by the names of Walsoken, Walton,\r\nand Walpoole. In the Middle Ages, however, it returned to its primeval\r\ndesolateness--a waste and wilderness, haunted by the foul legends of an\r\nunwholesome superstition. In the immediate neighbourhood of the great\r\nmonasteries of Crowland and Ely, and of the thriving towns, the good\r\nwork of drainage went on slowly; but elsewhere the land was given up to\r\nthe bittern and the heron.\r\n\r\nNo comprehensive scheme was adopted, however, until Russel, Earl of\r\nBedford, cut the great Bedford River, twenty-one miles long, and rescued\r\nfrom the desert the rich tract known by his name--the Bedford Level.\r\n\r\n                                    \"Erst\r\n    A dreary pathless waste, the coughing flock\r\n    Was wont with hairy fleeces to deform;\r\n    And, smiling with its lure of summer flowers,\r\n    The heavy ox, vain struggling, to ingulf;\r\n    Till one, of that high-honoured patriot name,\r\n    Russel, arose, who drained the rushy fen,\r\n    Confined the waves, bade groves and gardens bloom,\r\n    And through his new creation led the Ouse\r\n    And gentle Camus, silver-winding streams.\"[17]\r\n\r\nThe work was continued by William Earl of Bedford, who added, in 1649,\r\nto his father's old \"Bedford River\" that noble parallel river the\r\nHundred Foot, both rising high above the land to allow for flood water.\r\nIt was carried on at a later period under the direction of Government\r\nsurveyors. Then came Rennie, the great engineer, whose operations\r\neffectually shut out the desert, and handed over to the agriculturist\r\nnearly the whole level of the Fens, some seventy miles in length. Works\r\nare now in progress for rescuing a further portion of the basin of the\r\nWash, to be formed into a new county, and named after the Queen. So that\r\nnow, in tracts once covered by the sea, or knee-deep in reedy, slushy,\r\npestilential slime, the grass grows luxuriantly, the crops wave in\r\ngolden abundance, or the breeze takes up and carries afar--\r\n\r\n                              \"The livelong bleat\r\n    Of the thick-fleecèd sheep from wattled folds.\"\r\n\r\nBut the dominion of labour has not yet been established over the whole\r\nFen-district. There are still dreary nooks, and gloomy corners, and\r\nunproductive wastes; wild scenes there are, which few Englishmen have\r\nany conception of as contained within the boundaries of their own\r\n\"inviolate isle.\" Romantic scenery, remarks Mr. Walter White, must not\r\nbe looked for on the Lincolnshire coast. In all the journey from the\r\nWash till you see the land of Yorkshire, beyond the Humber, not an inch\r\nof cliff will your eyes discover. Monotonous is the prospect of--\r\n\r\n    \"A level waste, a rounding gray\"\r\n\r\nof sand-hills, which vary but slightly in height, and bristle with\r\n_marum_. \"But tame though it be,\" continues our authority,[18] \"the\r\nscene derives interest from its peculiarity. Strange perspective effects\r\nappear in those irregular hills: yonder they run out and form a low\r\ndark, purple headland, against which the pale green and yellow of a\r\nnearer tongue look bright by contrast. Here for a few furlongs the range\r\nrises gray, cold, and monotonous; there it has a warmth of colour\r\nrelieved by deep shadows, that change their tint during the hours that\r\naccompany the sun while he begins and ends his day. Sitting on the\r\nsummit of those dry hills, you will remark the contrasted landscape: on\r\nthe one side, the level pasture land, league after league of grassy\r\ngreen, sprinkled with villages, farms, churches, and schools, where work\r\nand worship will find exercise through ages yet to come; on the other,\r\nleague after league of tawny sand, sloping gently outwards to meet the\r\ngreat sea that ever foams or ripples thereupon. On the one hand, a\r\nliving scene bounded by the distant wolds; on the other, a desert, sea\r\nand shore alike solitary, bounded only by the overarching sky. More\r\nthoughts come crowding into the mind in presence of such a scene than\r\nare easy to express.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE STEPPES:--THE DESERT IN RUSSIA, SIBERIA, AND TARTARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have only been speaking of miniature deserts, of the more\r\nlimited of the world's wildernesses, where some degree of victory seems\r\nto reward man's arduous struggle with nature. Those which we have\r\nhitherto described are open to the \"breath of civilization.\" The pilgrim\r\nwho visits them incurs no danger; he has nothing to dread from beasts of\r\nprey; the men he meets with obey the same general laws as himself; he is\r\ncarried into their furthest recesses by the all-embracing railroad. He\r\nsees on every hand the efforts of science to confine the desert within\r\never narrower boundaries; to reclaim the moor, and the fen, and the\r\nsandy waste; to reap from the once barren soil an abundant harvest. But\r\nif he pass from England or France to Germany, and thence across the\r\nprovinces of unhappy Poland, he will find himself daily advancing into a\r\ncountry of more and more savage aspect. He will observe that vegetation\r\nloses its happy variety; that the cultivated fields become scarcer; the\r\nmorass and forest more frequent, and of greater extent; the population\r\npoorer, more squalid, and less numerous. Wide and dreary intervals\r\nseparate the different towns; here and there, surrounded by gloomy\r\nwoods, are scattered the melancholy-looking villages. Travelling becomes\r\ndifficult, for the roads are ill-kept; he has left behind him the modern\r\nmagician, the engineer; wild wolves haunt his path; and he has good\r\ncause to fear the robber's knife. Civilization here has left barbarism\r\nfor centuries to itself; we are approaching the great Deserts, the\r\nSteppes of Northern Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Steppes commence near the thirty-fifth degree of longitude, east of\r\nthe Dnieper, as soon as we quit the fertile plains of the Ukraine to\r\nenter the country of the Don Cossacks. They are the characteristic\r\nfeature of the immense zone which starts from the north-eastern shore\r\nof the Sea of Azov, stretches to the foot of Caucasus, between the Black\r\nand Caspian Seas, and is thence prolonged beyond the Ural range, to the\r\nnorth and south of the metaliferous Altaï; but mainly between the latter\r\nand the Thian-Shian mountains, to the seas of Okhotsk and Jesso.\r\n\r\nThe word _Steppe_, supposed to be of Tartar origin, primarily signifies\r\nan uncultivated plain, a prairie.\r\n\r\nThe Steppes, in short, are ordinarily plains of very considerable extent\r\ninterrupted at intervals by chains of hills or mountains; but, on the\r\nwhole, of a level, monotonous character, and with a considerable part\r\nbelow the level of the ocean. Their area may be roughly computed at\r\n4,200,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, in traversing them, we meet with lakes or brackish ponds,\r\nwith forests of pines, even with patches of cultivated ground. Sometimes\r\nthey form lofty and extensive plateaux, as in the case of the plateau of\r\nGobi, also called, but most inappropriately, _Scha-mo_, or the Sandy\r\nDesert, and _Scha-ho_, or the Sandy River.\r\n\r\nThe Gobi begins upon the confines of Chinese Tartary, and thence extends\r\nover thousands of leagues in a vast expanse of sterile wilderness\r\ntowards the coast of the Pacific. It chiefly consists of bare rock,\r\nshingle, and loose sand, alternating with firm sand, sparsely clothed\r\nwith vegetation. But a large portion of the country, though not less\r\nleafless and monotonous, assumes in the spring season the appearance of\r\nan undulating ocean of grass, supplying pasturage to the flocks and\r\nherds of the Mongolian nomades, who wander at will over its vast prairie\r\ngrounds, and encamp wherever they find a stream of water or sheltering\r\ncrag. The general elevation above the sea is probably not less than 3500\r\nfeet. The Gobi was crossed by Mr. Grant, in 1863, and, soon afterwards,\r\nby Mr. Bishop, a correspondent of the _Times_.\r\n\r\nThough their general aspect is chill and dreary, the Steppes are not\r\nwithout their romantic landscapes, and their vegetation is more varied\r\nas well as more abundant than is generally believed. You may find among\r\nthem wide meads with a soil of sufficient fertility to produce corn in\r\ngreat quantities, although too thin to permit the development of plants\r\nwhich have need of a certain depth. \"The most agreeable portion of these\r\nplains,\" says Humboldt, \"is adorned with small shrubs of the family\r\n_Rosaceæ_, tulips, and the _cypripedium_. Just as the Torrid Zone is\r\ndistinguished by the tendency of all its plants to become trees, so some\r\nof the Asiatic Steppes in the Temperate Zones have the peculiar\r\ncharacteristic that all their flowering herbaceous plants attain to a\r\nremarkable height, such as the _Saussurea_ and other synantheraceæ, the\r\nleguminous shrubs, and, above all, an infinite variety of astragals. If\r\nthe traveller attempts to go forward, in the small Tartar chariots,\r\nacross these pathless, trackless prairies, he must keep standing, to\r\nascertain his direction, and he will see the plants, interlaced as in a\r\ndense forest, bend before his wheels. Some of these Steppes are grassy\r\nplains; others are covered with saline plants, fleshy, articulated, and\r\nalways green. Often, too, one sees afar the glitter of saline\r\nefflorescence, like lichens, spreading unevenly over the glassy soil,\r\nlike newly-fallen snow.\"[19]\r\n\r\nComparing the Asiatic Steppes with the Pampas of South America, Humboldt\r\ndoes not hesitate to declare that the former are far the richer. \"In\r\nthat part of the Steppes, inhabited by the Kirghiz and the Kalmucks,\r\nwhich I have traversed,\" he says, \"that is to say, from the Don, the\r\nCaspian Sea, and the Oural (Jaïk), to the Obi and the Upper Irtysh, near\r\nLake Dsaisang, over a space of forty degrees of longitude, one can never\r\ndiscover, even at the most distant limit, a phenomenon frequent in the\r\nLlanos, the Pampas, and the Prairies of America; that horizon vague and\r\nboundless as the sea, which seems to support the vault of heaven. Seldom\r\nin Asia was the spectacle offered me of even a single side of the\r\nhorizon. The Steppes are traversed by numerous chains of hills, or\r\ncovered with forests of conifers. The vegetation of Asia, even in the\r\nrichest pasturage, is nowhere confined to the families of the\r\n_Cyperaceæ_. A great variety prevails there of herbaceous or frutescent\r\nplants. In the spring season, small rosaceæ and amygdalaceæ, with rosy\r\nor snow-white blossoms--Spiræa, cratægus, prunus spinosa, amygdalus\r\nnana--present a graceful appearance. I have elsewhere spoken,\" he adds,\r\n\"of the vigorous growth of Synanthers, such as _Suassurea amara_ and\r\n_salsa_, the _artemisias_ and blue _centaureas_, which grow profusely in\r\nthese deserts, and the leguminosæ, which are there represented by\r\ndifferent species of astragal, cytisus, and _caragana_. The fritillaria\r\nruthenica, meleagroides, cypripedium, and tulip, delight the eye with\r\nthe brilliance of their colours.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThis almost exclusively herbaceous, but abundant and various, vegetation\r\nof which Humboldt speaks, is conspicuous in the spring, in the least\r\nfavoured Steppes, after the rainy season. But it is there of a brief\r\nlife. In the month of June the heat grows intense, and the dryness\r\nexcessive. Then every herb perishes, cut down by the sun's keen-smiting\r\nrays, like the Greeks before Troy by the arrows of Apollo.\r\n\r\n    \"Bent was his bow, the Grecian hearts to wound;\r\n     Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThe dust is whirled off the ground by the wind, and swept about in\r\nrevolving tornados. The Steppes situated in a comparatively low latitude\r\nthus alternately assume the most discordant aspects. In winter the heavy\r\nrains inundate them, and transform them into impracticable marshes;\r\nspring clothes them with a thick carpet of grasses and other herbaceous\r\nplants, so that they reveal to the eye leagues upon leagues of\r\ndelightful sward cropped by numerous flocks. In summer they undergo a\r\nthird metamorphosis, and are converted into parched and sun-scathed\r\ndeserts like those of Nubia or Arabia.\r\n\r\nThese periodical transformations are especially remarkable in the\r\nSteppes of the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Caspian Sea; where\r\nwinter comes attended with abundant snows and terrific tempests. No\r\nobstacle can arrest the fury of the gale, which accumulates the driven\r\nsnow in fearful avalanches, and like the demon in the old German\r\nlegend, drives before it the wild horses in an access of violence. Half\r\nfrozen by the cold, and exhausted with hunger, they fly in a complete\r\npanic. Oftentimes their giddy headlong course carries them forward upon\r\nthe crust of ice which gathers over the waters close to the shore; it\r\ncracks, it breaks, and hundreds perish! The melting snow and heavy rains\r\nat the end of winter drown the plains under vast sheets of water, which,\r\nhowever, quickly evaporate in the first rays of the sun. Rain, in\r\nsummer, is extremely rare, and as there are neither brooks nor springs\r\nto refresh the thin layer of earth in which the herbs and shrubs take\r\nroot, all these plants enjoy only a butterfly existence; they bloom,\r\nthey fade, they die, with startling rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe hurricanes are neither less numerous nor less furious in the hot\r\nthan in the cold season; dust, however, takes the place of snow, when,\r\nas is sometimes the case, no tremendous deluge of rain follows in the\r\ntrack of the mighty wind. To sum up: the spring and summer of the\r\nSteppes are compressed (so to speak) into two months; all the rest of\r\nthe year seems given over to desolation. Two months in the year of\r\nbloom, and sunshine, and colour, and beauty, are all that Nature grants\r\nthe wandering Mongolian.\r\n\r\nSuch being the general configuration of the Steppes, one may easily\r\nimagine how stern and gloomy is the aspect of these immense plains, with\r\nno other interruptions of the soil than their tumuli, no other boundary\r\nthan the sea. He who has not been habituated from youth to their\r\nmonotony finds himself wholly unable to struggle against its depressing\r\ninfluence. Their dismal solitudes are in truth an immeasurable prison,\r\nwhere he wanders to and fro without hope of escape. In vain does he\r\ninterrogate the north and south, the east and the west; in vain does he\r\nturn from one side to the other; it is always the same uniformity, the\r\nsame immovability, the same solitude.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE STEPPES:--THE WILD HORSE--THE CAMEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the numerous troops of wild horse which haunt\r\nthe Steppes on this side of the Oural. Similar troops of these animals\r\nwander over the whole extent of the Steppes of Central Asia, which the\r\nmost accredited modern naturalists repute to be the original cradle of\r\ntheir race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TARPAN, OR WILD HORSE.]\r\n\r\nThese horses are called _tarpans_, a word undoubtedly derived from the\r\nTartar. Shall we look upon them as the representatives of the primitive\r\nbreed, whence have sprung all the varieties known at the present day; or\r\nshall we see in them, as well as in the wandering horses of the prairies\r\nand pampas of the New World, the descendants of individuals which had\r\nescaped from the thraldom of man? This latter hypothesis seems to be the\r\nmost probable. But there is good ground for believing that, living a\r\nwild life, these animals are gradually returning to the primitive type.\r\nThey have lost the harmonious graces of form, the beauty, and the vigour\r\nwhich we admire in the high-bred steed, perfected by the assiduous care\r\nof man. There seems as great a difference between the Arabian horse and\r\nthe wild horse of the Steppes as between the accomplished European\r\ngentleman and a Malagasy savage. They are of small stature; their limbs\r\nare lank; their coat is coarse, woolly, rude, and rough. With the\r\ntarpans of the northern Steppes it is thick, flaky, and frizzled. Their\r\nmouth and nostrils are garnished with long hair, not unlike a goat.\r\nTheir colour is generally brown, of the shade called _Isabelle_, after a\r\ncertain Queen of France who, in fulfilment of a vow, wore her linen\r\nunchanged for a considerable period. A few are black or white. They have\r\na large head, with the forehead projecting above the eyes; a straight\r\nchamfer; and long ears, customarily laid back close to the head.\r\n\r\nThe troops of the tarpans are subdivided into groups of twenty to thirty\r\nindividuals, each group usually living apart, and only uniting in a\r\ncompact phalanx when a common danger threatens, or a necessity arises of\r\nmigrating from one region to another. The gaunt grim wolves, which\r\nhunger drives from their neighbouring forests; and man, who hunts them\r\nhotly, either to reduce them into subjection, or kill them for their\r\nflesh, are almost the only enemies they have any reason to dread. The\r\nwarlike nomade tribes of the Black and Caspian coasts, and of Central\r\nAsia, have no other breeding-grounds than the steppe which they inhabit.\r\nThither come Cossack, and Mongol, and Kirghis, and Kalmuck, to choose\r\ntheir chargers. They catch them by means of a lasso, which they throw\r\nwith surprising dexterity, and in a few days train them into a suitable\r\ndocility. When in want of their hide or flesh, the nomades hunt them\r\nwith gun, arrow, or spear; for hippophagy, which a few zealous amateurs\r\nare now endeavouring to popularize in France and England, has been\r\npractised from time immemorial by the inhabitants of the Steppes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD HORSES TERRIFIED BY A STORM.]\r\n\r\nThese barbarians, however, respect the life of their domestic animals,\r\nor sacrifice them only in cases of pressing need. They treat them also\r\nwith a gentleness unknown to our European grooms and horse-dealers. With\r\nthem, as with the Arabs, the horse is a friend rather than a slave; he\r\nis, in truth, one of the family; and it is with great difficulty that\r\nhis master consents to part with him. Our travellers describe the\r\nTartar, Mongol, and Kirghiz horsemen as realizing the celebrated fable\r\nof the Centaurs,--as becoming, so to speak, one with their horses. The\r\nexigencies of their wandering life require that they should be\r\nconstantly on horseback; it is almost their home, their abode, their\r\ndwelling-place; there they are mounted day and night; there they sleep,\r\nprepare their food, and take their repasts. True that their cooking is\r\nof the rudest and simplest, and their taste not so fastidious as that of\r\nan European epicure! If, for example, they would make ready a piece of\r\nmeat, they insert it between the saddle and the horse's skin, and in\r\nthis impromptu oven leave it for a few hours, while it undergoes the\r\nprocesses of heat, pressure, and frequent friction, serving in some\r\ndegree to cook it; then a pinch of salt for seasoning; and lo! a dainty\r\ntitbit which our cavalier devours with the best appetite in the world.\r\n\r\nBut it is to the inhabitants of the Steppes of the Black and Caspian\r\nSeas that the horse renders the most estimable services. To make use of\r\na phrase of Buffon's, \"He shares with them the fatigue of war and the\r\nglory of battle;\" he provides them with the best and swiftest means of\r\ntransit; he nourishes them with his flesh, and the mare quenches their\r\nthirst with her milk. In _their_ dairies mares take the place of our\r\nEuropean milch-cows, and are regularly milked once or twice a-day. The\r\nmilk, warm, is employed as a medicine. It is thicker and more saccharine\r\nthan that of ruminating animals, and this, undoubtedly, is the reason\r\nthat the Cossacks, Tartars, and Kalmucks have succeeded, by\r\nfermentation, in distilling alcohol from it, and procuring vinegar by\r\nacetifying it. They prepare with it an intoxicating liquor (_koumis_),\r\nto which they are very partial, and with which the wealthiest among them\r\nconsider it an honour to be largely provided.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the horse, we naturally place his humble congener and\r\ncompatriot, the _Ass_.\r\n\r\nNor need we be ashamed to devote a few lines to this useful animal,\r\nthough civilization has appointed to it a very different lot from that\r\nof the horse.\r\n\r\nWhile man has devoted his utmost efforts to ennoble, as it were, and\r\naggrandize the latter, to perfect his capabilities, develop his\r\nqualities, embellish and vary his form, for the former he has had\r\nnothing but contempt and harsh treatment. He has made the horse the\r\ncompanion of his campaigns, the minister to his sumptuous pleasures, the\r\ninstrument of his grandest labours. He has dismissed the poor ass to the\r\nfields to carry the heaviest burdens, to share in the toil and privation\r\nof the peasant. In these different conditions, who will wonder that\r\nwhile the horse has become a strong, graceful, and proud-spirited\r\nanimal, the ass, on the other hand, remains bowed and bent, with a rough\r\ncoarse hide, lanky limbs, a heavy head,--always drooping, as if under\r\nthe weight of continual lassitude and unconquerable melancholy,--and\r\nlong ungraceful ears, which give his physiognomy an air of ridicule.\r\nEverything in him bears the impress of degradation. How has he merited\r\nso obscure a destiny? Alas, he is the victim of an iniquitous caprice of\r\nman. For see him in his natural condition; contrast with the well-worn\r\nservant of civilization the _Onagra_,[23] the free wild ass of the\r\nSteppes, with the Tarpan, and the parallel will be wholly to the\r\nadvantage of the former. The onagra is at least of the same size; his\r\nears are short; he carries aloft a well-proportioned head; his skin, of\r\na handsome gray or yellowish-brown, is sleek and shining; his limbs are\r\nlong, delicate, and nervous. He lives in very numerous troops, and\r\nmigrates from north to south, and south to north, according to the\r\nseason. The Tartars employ him as a beast of transport and the saddle\r\nrather than as a beast of burden. They eat his flesh, preferring it to\r\nthat of the wild horse. Even the domestic ass of the East differs\r\nnotably from the slow, dogged, ill-used animal of European notoriety.\r\nUnder a more favourable climate, and in the free life of the desert, he\r\nhas preserved his tall stature, his vigour, and the haughtiness of his\r\nbearing. The wealthiest and most distinguished personages do not disdain\r\nto mount him or harness him to their carriage. He has a keen eye, a\r\nquick scent, a sure foot, a mild and resolute aspect. He accomplishes\r\nwith ease from six to eight miles an hour; and, lastly--a fact worthy of\r\nnotice--his life, which with us seldom exceeds fifteen years, in Asia is\r\nfrequently prolonged to thirty or thirty-five. He is less subject to\r\nsickness than the horse, and he almost equals the camel in sobriety,\r\ndocility, and endurance of hunger and fatigue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONAGRA, OR WILD ASS.]\r\n\r\nWhether the Tartars and Kalmucks, who use mares' milk as a medicine,\r\nattribute, as we do, certain therapeutical virtues to the milk of the\r\nass, we are unable to say; but it is certain that this milk forms a\r\nportion of their daily food. On account of the strong proportion of\r\nsaccharine _serum_ which it contains, it is well adapted for the\r\npreparation of the fermented drink already spoken of, known to the\r\nTartars under the name of _Koumis_ or _Kamuis_. Mr. Atkinson speaks of\r\nthe large leathern _koumis_ sack or bottle, as an important piece of\r\nMongolian furniture. One which he saw was five feet eight inches long,\r\nand four feet five inches wide, with a leathern tube at the corner about\r\nfour inches in diameter, through which the milk is poured into the bag,\r\nand the _koumis_ drawn out. A wooden instrument is introduced into this\r\nbag, its handle passing through the tube, not unlike a churning staff;\r\nwith this the _koumis_ is frequently agitated. The Kirghiz begin making\r\nit in April, and its due agitation and fermentation occupy about\r\nfourteen days.[24]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe horse, and a few flocks of sheep and herds of horned cattle, amply\r\nsuffice for the wants of the warlike tribes in the south of Asiatic\r\nRussia. These tribes have almost entirely abandoned the use of the\r\ncamel. But as we advance eastward, we find these gigantic and mis-shapen\r\nruminants in great numbers, the faithful companions and indispensable\r\nauxiliaries of the nomades of the East. They wander freely about the\r\nSteppes, in troops of several hundreds, browzing indifferently on the\r\ngrass of the wide pastures or the foliage of the bushes. They are\r\nwithout fierceness, and the traveller who intrudes upon their immense\r\ndomains seems only to inspire in them a benevolent curiosity. \"It is\r\nimpossible to describe,\" says Madame Hommaire de Hell, \"the astonishment\r\nthey exhibited as we passed them. As soon as they caught sight of us,\r\nthey ran with all speed towards us, and then stood motionless, with\r\nheads turned towards our cavalcade, until we had got to such a distance\r\nas to be no longer distinguishable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gold and silk,\" says Buffon, \"are not the true wealth of Asia. The\r\n_camel_ is the treasure of the East.\" It is a fact that this animal is\r\nwonderfully adapted to supply the wants of the desert races. It may be\r\nsaid to supply them with every object of primary necessity; food,\r\nclothing, and even habitation, fire, and the means of transport.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the young camel, though inferior to beef or mutton, is\r\nsavoury and easy of digestion; the she-camel yields an abundance of milk\r\nas substantial and agreeable to the taste as that of the cow. The\r\ncamel's skin is, it is true, a coarse wool, but long, tenacious, and\r\nreadily wrought. The Mongols make it into tissues and cord. Out of the\r\ntissues they weave their clothing, coverings, and tents; with the cord,\r\nwhich is of various thicknesses, they fabricate the harness of their\r\nhorses and other objects of equipment. Camel-leather is not inferior in\r\nsuppleness and solidity to that which we make use of in Europe. The dung\r\nof these animals, dried in the sun, serves as fuel not only for cooking\r\nfood, but even for working metals. Finally, as a beast of burden, the\r\ncamel surpasses every other in strength, swiftness, endurance of\r\nfatigue, and, above all, in that proverbial sobriety which enables him\r\nto accomplish a journey of several successive days without taking either\r\nfood or drink. From nature he has received a special organization, which\r\nwell justifies his Arab name of \"the ship of the desert.\" It consists\r\nessentially in the structure of his feet, in that of his stomach, and in\r\nthe species of hunch or hump which he carries on his back.\r\n\r\nWe know, in the first place, that the camel's foot does not resemble\r\nthat of other ruminants; it is bifurcated, but the two toes, very strong\r\nand much elongated, are furnished not with a hoof, but with a short\r\nnail, adhering only to the final phalange; they are, moreover,\r\n_palmated_; that is to say, reunited near the extremity by a carneous\r\nmembrane, which is supplied underneath with a veritable thick and horny\r\n_sole_. The foot can thus plant itself on a wide surface, and seems\r\nexpressly adapted to the shifting sandy soil which the camel usually\r\ntraverses.\r\n\r\nAs for the stomach, beside the four compartments into which the stomach\r\nof all ruminants is divided, we notice, on the sides of the paunch, a\r\nmass of cubic cells, or partitions, always containing a quantity of\r\ntolerably pure water, very drinkable, and kept as a kind of reserve\r\nsupply; so that more than one traveller, when crossing the desert, and\r\nperceiving neither fountain, well, nor stream in which to quench his\r\ndevouring thirst, has preserved his life at the expense of that of his\r\ncamel, by killing the poor animal, and opening his reservoir to drink\r\nits contents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BACTRIAN CAMEL.]\r\n\r\nThe hump, of which the Arabian camel, or dromedary, has but one, while\r\nthe Bactrian, or camel properly so called, has two, is, in truth, \"a\r\nstorehouse of solid nutriment, on which he can draw for supplies long\r\nafter every digestible part has been extracted from the contents of the\r\nstomach: this storehouse consists of one or two large collections of fat\r\nstored up in ligamentous cells supported by the spines of the dorsal\r\nvertebræ. When the camel is in a region of fertility, the hump becomes\r\nplump and expanded; but after a protracted journey in the wilderness it\r\nbecomes shrivelled and reduced to its ligamentous constituent, in\r\nconsequence of the absorption of the fat.\"[25]\r\n\r\nTo be deprived of drink for from eight to ten days is no hardship to the\r\ncamel. Accredited authorities testify that without any serious\r\ninconvenience he can go without drink for twenty-three and even\r\ntwenty-five days. In the way of solid food, a ball of cake weighing from\r\na pound to a pound and a quarter, will suffice him for a whole day.\r\nOften when he has set out on his journey fasting, he contents himself\r\nwith browsing on the way a few green or dry bushes, and in the evening\r\nsups on a handful of dried beans. But this singular abstemiousness is\r\nnot his sole good quality; his vigour, his docility, his swiftness\r\nrender him equally valuable.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary burden of a small camel is from 600 to 800 lbs.; a large\r\ncamel will carry 1000 lbs. or upwards, from thirty to thirty-five miles\r\na-day; but the _maharis_, or those which are used for speed alone, will\r\ntravel daily from twenty to thirty leagues.\r\n\r\nThe camel of the Steppes, in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, is, as I\r\nhave already hinted, the Bactrian or camel strictly so called. This\r\nanimal differs from his African congener in several very important\r\nphysical characteristics, and perhaps also in some moral peculiarities.\r\nHis two humps are smaller than the one hump of the dromedary. He is a\r\nlittle larger than the latter; his average stature is from six feet and\r\na half to seven feet. His hair, of a deep chestnut brown, almost woolly\r\non the humps, the head, and the upper part of the neck, is short and\r\nsmooth on the body, and hangs in long fringes below the neck and around\r\nthe fore-legs. He endures without inconvenience the most opposite\r\ntemperatures, great heat and extreme cold, so that his habitat naturally\r\nranges over an immense extent of country. He is found throughout the\r\nzone of the Steppes, even to the confines of Siberia, on the borders of\r\nLake Baïkal; he was formerly still more common in Hindostan, but has now\r\nalmost disappeared, owing to the great consumption entailed by the\r\nmilitary expeditions of our East Indian Government.\r\n\r\nThe camel is an excellent traveller, but his gait is rough and awkward,\r\nand almost insupportable by those who have not been long habituated to\r\nit. In this relation we may borrow an anecdote from Madame Hommaire de\r\nHell:[26] Her dragoman, a Frenchman, named Antoine, curious to essay\r\nthis new species of equestrian practice, begged a Kalmuck in the escort\r\nto lend him his camel. The request being readily granted, he perched\r\nhimself on the extremity of the saddle, in \"measureless contentment\"\r\nwith his lofty post, and by no means mindful of the malicious smiles\r\nexchanged between the Cossacks and the camel-drivers. Scarcely had the\r\nbeast advanced four paces, however, before his face turned pale, and he\r\nclung to the saddle, with a most pitiful countenance, and imploring help\r\nin the most agonizing tones. \"One need be a Kalmuck,\" says Madame de\r\nHell, \"to be capable of enduring the trot of a camel. His jerky gait\r\nshakes the body so severely, that a long journey is a positive\r\npunishment, even for the Cossacks. The unfortunate Antonio, left some\r\ndistance behind by the escort, made a vain effort to overtake us; he was\r\ncompelled, willy-nilly, to retain his steed as far as the Caspian Sea,\r\nwhere he arrived about two hours after ourselves. I have never seen a\r\nman more _demoralized_. His groans, when he was lifted off the camel,\r\nwere so lamentable, that we really hardly knew what to think of his\r\ncondition.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the camel's moral qualities, the same lively writer furnishes a\r\nvery different estimate to what we gather from the majority of\r\ntravellers. She represents him as idle, pettish, and very vindictive.\r\n\r\n\"All that we had read,\" says she, \"of the rapidity of these ships of the\r\ndesert; their insensibility to fatigue, to hunger, to thirst; their\r\ntractability to the will of man exceeding the obedience of the leaf to\r\nthe wind, was completely contradicted by the conduct of these\r\nquadrupeds, little careful to maintain their reputation for agility.\r\nDespite of a stout cord passed through one of the nostrils, and which\r\ncaused them a sharp pain every time they became refractory, they would\r\nnot march more than two successive hours without flinging themselves on\r\nthe ground. We had to battle with them incessantly to rouse them from\r\ntheir torpor, and prevent them from biting one another. Whenever a\r\ncamel-driver pulled a little roughly his animal's guiding-string, we\r\nheard a succession of cries, all the more frightful from their\r\nresemblance to the human voice. In a word, these camels behaved so ill\r\nduring their short journey, that we entirely lost the good opinion our\r\ngreat naturalist (Buffon) had given us of their species, in descriptions\r\nmore poetical than true.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Antoine's discouraging experience of camel-riding,\r\nMadame de Hell, a few days afterwards, essayed the same experiment, with\r\nthe result that, like her poor dragoman, she made a vow never to repeat\r\nit. Somewhat later, she had an opportunity of witnessing a very curious\r\nillustration--and one very amusing to the lookers-on--of the natural\r\nvindictiveness of these rough steeds. We give the adventure in her own\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n\"Everybody knows that the camel possesses the faculty of ruminating the\r\nfood already stored in one of his stomachs, and that he willingly enough\r\ngrants himself this pleasure when he has nothing to eat; but it is not\r\ngenerally known, perhaps, that he possesses sufficient malice to make,\r\nwhen an opportunity arises, this prerogative a means of vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"I had noticed in the morning that one of our camel-drivers appeared on\r\nbad terms with his beast. He vainly tried to master him by punishment,\r\npulling with all his might the cord which passed through the animal's\r\nnostril; the latter was obstinate, and threw himself every moment on the\r\nground, a proof of rebellion. The Kalmuck, irritated by the struggle,\r\nprofited by a halt to dismount, and inflict severe chastisement on the\r\nrecalcitrant; but the camel, disdainfully raising his long neck,\r\nfollowed with so malicious an eye all his tyrant's movements, that\r\nwithout doubt he was revolving some project of revenge in his head. And\r\nso it happened that he quietly waited until the Kalmuck stood opposite\r\nto him; then, opening his great mouth, he ejected full in the\r\ncamel-driver's face a double volley of masticated herbs, mixed with\r\nslaver and all sorts of filthiness. It would be impossible to describe\r\nthe air of satisfied vengeance with which the camel raised his neck, and\r\nmoved his head from one side to another, as if in quest of applause.\r\nWhat astonished me most in this affair was his master's moderation after\r\nundergoing such an outrage. He wiped himself coolly, remounted his\r\nsaddle, and caressed the neck of the ill-bred animal, as if he had\r\nreceived the most flattering compliment. A good understanding being thus\r\nstrangely re-established, they went on their way peaceably, without\r\ngiving another thought to what had taken place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ANIMAL LIFE OF THE STEPPES:--WILD RUMINATING\r\nANIMALS--RODENTS--CARNIVORA--BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides those species of which we have just spoken, and which man has\r\nsubjugated to his service, the Steppes nourish a host of other animals\r\nwhich seem for ever destined to a savage life. Some are spread through\r\nthe entire zone of the Steppes, and include representatives of the\r\ngenera or species belonging to the temperate latitudes of Europe. But\r\nmost of them are circumscribed in more or less limited habitats, out of\r\nwhich they would not meet with the conditions of climate or provision\r\nthat are essential to their existence.\r\n\r\nThe mammalia which are found in the plains of Eastern Europe and Central\r\nAsia belong principally to the orders of _Ruminants_,[27] _Rodents_, and\r\n_Carnaria_.\r\n\r\nCuvier divides the ruminants into two great sections: one comprising the\r\nruminants without horns (genera, _camel_, _lama_, and _chevrotain_); and\r\nthe other, those _with_ horns. The latter he again divides into\r\nruminants with decaying or wooden horns (these are the _cervidæ_ of the\r\nnew nomenclature), ruminants with membraneous horns (as the giraffes),\r\nand ruminants with hollow horns (oxen, goats, antelopes, sheep).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ELAND (_Antilope oreas_).]\r\n\r\nThe section of Ruminants without horns is represented in the Steppes by\r\nthe camel. Of the three groups of horned ruminants, one only is wanting\r\nin this region of the Old Continent--namely, that of the ruminants with\r\nmembranous horns; but we meet there with varieties of all the species\r\nincluded among the cervidæ, except the reindeer, which is confined to\r\nthe glacial countries of both continents. The common European stag is\r\nfound on this side of the Oural, in the Steppes bordering on the\r\nforests, where he prefers to seek an asylum. The _ahu_, or roebuck of\r\nTartary, inhabits the valleys and plains which stretch to the north of\r\nthe Himalaya and along the chain of the Thian-Chan. Deer wander in\r\ntroops, or in isolated couples, in all the temperate and fertile\r\nportions of the zone of the Steppes, and the eland is spread over all\r\nAsia between the 45th and 41st degree of latitude. The latter is the\r\nlargest of all the cervidæ. It ordinarily attains, and sometimes\r\nexceeds, the stature of the horse. His antlers, spread out\r\nperpendicularly to the axis of his head, take at first a nearly\r\nhorizontal direction, then spring upwards in an abrupt curve. At their\r\nextremity they terminate in a broad palm, set with sharp snags around\r\nits outer edge. Their weight, for adults, averages from fifty-five to\r\nsixty-five pounds. The eland has a short robust neck, which is necessary\r\nto enable him to support the burden of his branching honours; but which,\r\njoined to the projection of his shoulders, and the disproportionate\r\nlength of his fore-legs, gives him a very ungraceful aspect. Nor can he\r\nbrowse the herbage without making a great digression or falling on his\r\nknees. The male, moreover, under the throat has a sort of goître, or\r\nswelling, garnished with a rude pointed beard. The female wears a beard,\r\nbut has no goître. The neck is surmounted with a short, stiff, blackish\r\nmane. The rest of the hair is of a pronounced gray.\r\n\r\nThe eland inhabits the marshy plains and banks of rivers; he dreads the\r\nheat, and to escape it will often remain during the long summer days\r\nplunged up to his neck in the cool waters. He lives with his comrades in\r\ntolerably numerous herds. The first birth of the female is only one;\r\nafterwards she produces two at a time. Frequently the eland attains a\r\nprodigious stature. An individual killed in the Altaï measured four feet\r\nand a half in height to the shoulder, and four feet and a third in\r\nlength. His flesh is said to be light and nourishing; his hide excellent\r\nfor making shoulder-belts; and his antlers are converted to the same\r\nuses as the horns of the stag.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the hollow-horned ruminants I may mention the _Saiga_, a kind of\r\nantelope which inhabits the Asiatic Steppes, and is met with even in\r\nPoland. In figure he takes the poetical elegance of the gazelle; his\r\nhorns are of a clear yellow colour, and of a transparency which rivals\r\nthat of tortoise-shell. His forehead is covered with transversal folds;\r\nhe has no muzzle, properly speaking, but a kind of snout like that of a\r\nhog. It is said that he drinks through his nostrils. The saigas travel\r\nin herds of about two thousand each, of whom a certain number keep\r\nalways some distance in advance, in the rear, and on the flanks of the\r\nmain host, so as to watch over their security.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother kind of gazelle, the _Dseren_, is peculiar to the Mongolian\r\nDeserts, and named by the inhabitants the _yellow stag_. His stature is\r\nlittle inferior to that of the deer. The female is without horns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Moufflon_,[28] the original of our domestic sheep, sometimes strays\r\ninto the plains of Central Asia, but prefers the solitude of the\r\nmountains. His general size is that of a small fallow deer, but though\r\nclothed with hair instead of wool, he bears a closer resemblance to the\r\nram than to any other animal. In summer his hair is close, but in winter\r\nit becomes rough, wavy, and slightly curled. On the upper part of the\r\nbody it is brown, but the under part and insides of the limbs are\r\nwhitish. The hair is considerably longer under the throat, and about the\r\nneck and shoulders, than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe may refer, in this connection, to the _Egagra_, or wild goat, which\r\nCuvier considers to have been the original stock of the numerous races\r\nof goats spread over various regions of the globe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Steppes nourish two species of _Rodents_: the Varying Hare (_Lepus\r\nvariabilis_), so called because he changes from tawny gray in summer to\r\nwhite in winter; and a gray squirrel, which is probably only a variety\r\nof our common European squirrel. He is not a climber and a \"haunter of\r\nthe woods,\" like his congener. He abounds in the Mongolian Steppes,\r\nwhere he lives in holes excavated under the earth, like the rats and\r\nrabbits. He is, however, much more ingenious than the other\r\ntroglodyte-rodents; he shelters the entrance to his abode under a domed\r\nroof, skilfully constructed of dry herbs woven together, and covered\r\nwith clay. These works closely resemble the mounds upheaved by moles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Carnaria of the _Felidæ_, or feline family, are wanting, or nearly\r\nso, in the immense zone which we are considering. Except a species of\r\nlynx, the _Chilason_ or _Chulon_, whose existence has been recognized in\r\nthe north of Tartary; and a few tigers which adventure into Mongolia, we\r\nmay say that the Asiatic Steppes, and, therefore, also those of Europe,\r\nare exempt from these inconvenient guests. The most dangerous, and\r\nalmost the only enemy which man and the herbivora have reason to dread,\r\nis the _Wolf_. This animal, now very rare in Western Europe, where his\r\nrace will soon disappear, is still found in great numbers in the wild\r\nLithuanian forests, in Russia, and all Northern and Central Asia. To\r\nhim, as to other animals of the _Canidæ_, cold appears more favourable\r\nthan heat, and it is in countries where the average temperature seldom\r\nrises high he attains his greatest dimensions. In Lithuania wolves are\r\noften met with which measure three feet and a half in length, without\r\nthe tail. Those of Northern Asia are also of a great size and nerve, of\r\nterrible strength and audacity; they have been seen to pounce on a\r\nsheep, and carry it off at full speed. They intrude in quest of victims\r\ninto the towns, the villages, and the encampments; combat to the last\r\nwith their enemies; and when vanquished die without a groan. Generally\r\nthey lurk in the woods and forests; but hunger, according to the\r\nproverb, drives them forth from their lairs. Then they assemble in vast\r\nhordes; they pursue, they assail, they defend, with ingenious tactic,\r\nskilfully availing themselves of the disposition and accidents of the\r\nground. Their manoeuvres vary according to the nature of the game or\r\nthe enemy. In general, if a man preserve an upright bearing and a bold\r\ncountenance, they will not attack him; they follow him stealthily,\r\nhowever, prepared to pounce upon him if, unhappily, he should stumble or\r\nfalter. But the wolves of Tartary, far from sharing in this deference\r\ntowards the lord of creation, display a singular bitterness against him.\r\n\"It is remarked,\" says the Jesuit missionary Huc, \"that the Mongolian\r\nwolves attack man more willingly than any animals; one sees them\r\nsometimes galloping through innumerable flocks of sheep, without\r\ninflicting any injury, in order to dash upon the shepherd. In the\r\nneighbourhood of the Great Wall they frequently descend upon the\r\nTartar-Chinese villages, enter the farms, turn aside with contempt from\r\nthe domestic animals which they encounter, and penetrate even into the\r\ninterior of the houses to select their victims, seizing them invariably\r\nby the throat and strangling them. Not a village in Tartary but has\r\nevery year to deplore some calamity of this kind. One might say that the\r\nwolves of this country sought specially to avenge themselves on men for\r\nthe blood-thirsty war the Tartars wage against them.\" And it is true\r\nthat in their pursuit of these animals the inhabitants of the Steppes\r\ndisplay not only an ardour which would be legitimate, but a fierce and\r\nuncontrollable cruelty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTURE OF A WOLF BY A KIRGHIZ HORSEMAN.]\r\n\r\n\"They pursue them everywhere _à outrance_,\" remarks M. Huc; \"they regard\r\nthem as their chief enemy, on account of the terrible losses they\r\ninflict upon their flocks. The news that a wolf has made his appearance\r\nin the neighbourhood is for everybody a signal to 'mount and ride away.'\r\nAnd as each cavalier has always two or three saddled horses in waiting\r\nnear his tent, the plain is speedily covered, as if by enchantment, with\r\na cloud of eager horsemen. Their weapon is a long rod.[29] Thus, in\r\nwhatever direction the wolf may seek to escape, he encounters a band of\r\ndetermined adversaries, whose cry, as they precipitate themselves upon\r\ntheir traditional foe, is 'No quarter!' There are no mountain-sides so\r\nrugged or so difficult, that the nimble horses of the Tartars cannot\r\npursue him thither. The cavalier who finally overtakes the beast, flings\r\na lasso round his neck as he passes at full gallop, and drags him in his\r\nrapid track to the nearest tent. There they firmly bind up his muzzle,\r\nthat they may proceed to torture him with impunity, closing up the\r\ntragic scene by flaying him alive, and then setting him free. In the\r\nsummer the miserable animal will live in this condition for several\r\ndays; but in winter, exposed without his furry coat to the rigour of the\r\nseason, he dies almost immediately, frozen to death.\"[30]\r\n\r\nIt is generally considered that the wolf is an animal as cowardly as he\r\nis fierce, because he flies before man when man does not retreat before\r\nhim, and because he kills unoffending animals. But we forget that man\r\nacts in a precisely similar manner. Numerous experiments, and especially\r\nthose of Cuvier, have clearly proved that the wolf is fully capable of\r\nbeing domesticated, is very sensible of kindly treatment, and will as\r\nreadily grow familiar with, and attached to, his master, as the best of\r\ndogs. We must, therefore, refer his ferocity to the instinct of\r\nself-preservation and of a vengeance too frequently excited; just as at\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, the unfortunate Bosjesmen, formerly treated like\r\nbeasts by the Dutch colonists, though naturally of a peaceable\r\ndisposition, became active and cruel aggressors, and daring assailants,\r\nagainst the enemies who had exhausted their patience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo other wild beasts of the dog genus, the _Korsak_ and the _Karogun_,\r\nare eagerly hunted by the Tartars, especially by the Kirghiz. But the\r\nchase, in this instance, is carried on for industrial purposes. The fur\r\nof these animals is very valuable, and the Kirghiz hunters carry\r\nthousands every year to the great market of Orenburg. The korsak is a\r\nspecies of fox. In colour he closely resembles the jackal; but he has a\r\nlong tail, with a black tuft at the tip, and on each side of the head a\r\nbrown stripe extends from the eye to the muzzle. He ranges over all the\r\nSteppes of Tartary, and lives in burrows like the foxes. The natives\r\npretend that he never drinks. He is a very handsome animal, and when,\r\ntowards the close of the sixteenth century, several individuals were\r\nbrought to Europe, he became quite the fashion. All the great ladies of\r\nthe court were desirous of possessing one, which they tended in their\r\nchambers, and when promenading in the parks, often led about like a\r\nspaniel. The mania was of brief duration, but it clearly showed how\r\neasily the animal could be tamed and reared.\r\n\r\nBuffon has confounded the karogun with the isatis or polar fox, and\r\nother animals with the korsak. He is equally distinct from the one as\r\nfrom the other, and the Kirghiz never make a mistake, though they hunt\r\nfor both in the same districts. His skin is of an ashen gray on the\r\nback, and a pale yellow under the belly. His fur is not less precious\r\nthan that of the korsak.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wild Ornithology of the Steppes comprises some migratory palmipedes,\r\na few gallinaceæ, and some predatory birds of the falcon family. Gulls,\r\nwild ducks, herons, curlews, and especially pelicans, people the shores\r\nof the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Caspian, with the banks of\r\nthe rivers that flow into them, and the neighbouring pools. The Cossack\r\nand Kalmük chiefs, who now ardently cherish the love of falconry that\r\nwas so marked a trait in the character of the mediæval nobles, hunt\r\nthese birds with much enthusiasm, save, indeed, the pelican, whose flesh\r\nis not edible.\r\n\r\nThe _herons_ form, in the order _Grallatores_ and the tribe\r\n_Cultirostres_ (knife-like beak), a family (_Ardeidæ_) composed of\r\nnumerous species, several of which inhabit or frequent the marshes,\r\nlakes, and streams of the region of the Steppes.\r\n\r\n    \"O'er yonder lake the while,\r\n     What bird about that wooded isle,\r\n     With pendant feet and pinions slow,\r\n     Is seen his ponderous length to row?\r\n     'Tis the tall heron's awkward flight,\r\n     His crest of black, and neck of white,\r\n     Far sunk his gray-blue wings between,\r\n     And giant legs of murky green.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable species is the great white heron (_Ardea alba_), or\r\nyellow-billed white egret, clothed in plumage of snowy white, with a\r\nlong yellow bill, long lank limbs, and black feet; length about forty\r\ninches. On the nape and the croup his feathers are long and flexible,\r\nwavy, and with tapering ends; they are eagerly sought after for purposes\r\nof adornment. We may also mention the great bittern, the \"bird of\r\ndesolation\" (_Botauris stellaris_)--which the French expressively name\r\n_eau-mère_, or \"water-mother,\" and which derives its zoological\r\nappellation from the Latin words _bos_ and _taureau_, in allusion to the\r\nbooming, bellowing sound of his hoarse voice. His plumage is of a pale\r\nyellow, marked with brown and nest-coloured zig-zag patches and shades.\r\nFrom the fulness of the feathers about his neck, he presents a very\r\nquaint, and even ridiculous appearance; but he is a bird of courage, and\r\neven of ferocity, striking with keen bill at the eyes of his antagonist.\r\nWhen attacked by dogs or other carnivora, he will throw himself upon the\r\nground, and fight with both claws and bill unto the very last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Great Bittern. 2. White Heron or Egret. 3. Curlew.]\r\n\r\nThe _curlew_ is allied to the ibis, differing from it only in secondary\r\nparticulars, and notably in the form of his bill, which is thinner, and\r\nrounded in its whole length. His tail resembles the hen's; the plumage\r\nof the head, neck, and fore part of the back, is light reddish-gray,\r\nstreaked with dark-brown; the hind part of the back is white, with dark\r\nnarrow longitudinal markings; the tail, breast, and abdomen are white,\r\nthe former crossed with black bars, and the latter with dark marks and\r\nspots of a similar shape to those on the back. The female lays four\r\nexcessively large pyriform eggs, about three inches long. The cry of the\r\ncurlew is loud, wild, and plaintive. These birds assemble in numerous\r\nflocks, and live on the sea-coast and the marsh-border, feeding on worms\r\nand molluscs. At breeding-time they separate into pairs, and haunt the\r\nwild hills and dreary moorlands,--\r\n\r\n    \"Remote from human sight,\r\n     In lonely pairs their vernal flight\r\n     They speed o'er heathy mountain rude,\r\n     On some waste marsh's solitude,\r\n     To the tall grass or bristling reed\r\n     Their wild unnestled young to breed.\"\r\n\r\nThe species of _Pelican_ which inhabits the shores of the Black and\r\nCaspian Seas is the Common (_Pelicanus Onocrotalus_). We must not pass\r\nunnoticed this well-known wader, which has for ages been invested with\r\nan atmosphere of song and fable, and which is specially remarkable for\r\nthe bright yellow membranous pouch attached to the lower mandible of his\r\nlong robust bill. This pouch, says Broderip, will hold a considerable\r\nnumber of fish, and thus enables the bird to dispose of the superfluous\r\nquantity which may be taken during fishing excursions, either for his\r\nown consumption or for the nourishment of his young. \"In feeding the\r\nnestlings--and the male is said to supply the wants of the female, when\r\nsitting, in the same manner--the under mandible is pressed against the\r\nneck and breast, to assist the bird in disgorging the contents of the\r\ncapacious pouch; and during this action the red nail of the upper\r\nmandible would appear to come in contact with the breast, thus laying\r\nthe foundation, in all probability, for the _fable_ that the pelican\r\nnourishes her young with her blood, and for the attitude in which the\r\nimagination of painters has placed the bird in books of emblems, with\r\nthe blood spirting from the wounds made by the terminating nail of the\r\nupper mandible into the gaping mouths of her offspring.\"\r\n\r\nIt is usually in the evening or the morning that these birds gather\r\nabout the lonely shores to fish in company, like a party of sociable\r\nIzaak Waltons, and proceeding, as Nordmann remarks, upon a systematic\r\nplan, which is apparently the result of a kind of concerted agreement.\r\nThey select a suitable station--a shallow bay with a smooth bottom.\r\nThere they arrange themselves in a half-circle, the bill turned towards\r\nthe ground, and keeping at a distance of from ten to twelve feet. With\r\ntheir wings they beat the water hurriedly, and sometimes plunge in up to\r\ntheir middle, gradually wading towards the beach, and driving the fish\r\nbefore them into a very narrow channel. Now the feast commences, and\r\nother birds never fail to profit by the ingenious labours of the\r\npelican. Nordmann counted, on one occasion, forty-nine pelicans fishing\r\ntogether in this fashion on the shores of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n\"Besides these forty-nine,\" he adds, \"there were assembled on the heaps\r\nof algæ, confervæ, and shells cast ashore by the sea, hundreds of\r\nsea-mews, sea-swallows, sea-daws, preparing to snatch the fish out of\r\nthe water, and to divide amongst themselves the remains of the banquet.\r\nFinally, several grebes swimming in the area circumscribed by the\r\nsemicircle of fishers, while this space was still sufficiently broad,\r\nplayed their part at the welcome feast, frequently plunging after the\r\nscared and terrified fish.\"\r\n\r\nThe _bustard_ and the _grouse_, or heather-cock, are common enough in\r\nthe prairies of Central Asia. Crows and numerous birds of prey also\r\nflock thither in search of their dead or living prey. Travellers speak\r\nof a _black eagle_ of Mongolia which the Mongols and Kalkas train to\r\nhunt the _moufflon_, the yellow goat, and the saiga. We cannot find the\r\nbird described under this name by any naturalist, nor can we determine\r\nwhether he is an eagle properly so called, or whether he is not rather\r\nthe cosmopolitan black kite (_milvus ater_), which rises so fiercely on\r\nhis plumed wings,\r\n\r\n    \"And hunts the air for plunder.\"\r\n\r\nWe may mention, as also proper to Central Asia, the _Aquila bifasciata_\r\nof Dr. Gray, and several species of buzzards, hawks, and falcons. These\r\n_Raptores_ live very peacefully in the desert solitudes, where none\r\ndisturb them; and so little do they fear man, that they venture into the\r\nMongol encampments and carry off the provisions destined for the\r\ntravellers' refreshment. An incident of this nature is recorded by the\r\nAbbé Huc, who, with his companions, was at the time preparing to sup on\r\na quarter of a kid skilfully \"dished up\" by their Tartar neophyte,\r\nSamdadchiemba.\r\n\r\n\"We had just seated ourselves,\" says M. Huc, \"in a triangle on the\r\ngrassy sward, having in our midst the lid of the pot which served\r\ninstead of a dish, when suddenly a noise like thunder broke over our\r\nheads. A great eagle fell like an arrow on our supper, and rose again\r\nwith the same rapidity, carrying off in his claws some slices of kid.\r\nWhen we had recovered from our surprise, we had nothing better to do\r\nthan laugh at the adventure. However, Samdadchiemba could not laugh, not\r\nhe; he was exceedingly wroth, not on account of the stolen kid, but\r\nbecause the eagle, in flying off, had insolently buffeted him with the\r\ntip of his wing....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EAGLE OF THE STEPPES, AND THE ANTELOPE SAIGA.]\r\n\r\n\"The eagle,\" adds our author, \"is found almost everywhere in the deserts\r\nof Tartary. You see him sometimes hovering and wheeling round and round\r\nin the air; sometimes, perched upon a hillock in the middle of the\r\nplain, he remains there for a long time as motionless as a sentinel.\r\nOften we encounter him on the ground, apparently larger than an ordinary\r\nsheep; when we draw near, he is compelled, before he can rise into the\r\nair, to make a long detour, agitating his heavy wings; after which,\r\nsucceeding in lifting himself a little above the ground, he soars aloft\r\nat pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Erpetological fauna of the Steppes is little known, and is probably\r\nvery scanty. Unfortunately, this region has not been explored by\r\nscientific naturalists, and the unprofessional travellers who have\r\nvisited it do not appear to have met with any reptiles which seemed to\r\nthem worthy of detailed notice. Atkinson, however, speaks of the stony\r\nridges of the plain as \"swarming with _serpents_.\"--\"I observed,\" he\r\nsays,[32] \"four varieties: A black one, three feet eight inches long,\r\nand about one inch and an eighth in diameter. Another was of slaty-gray\r\ncolour, from two to three feet long, and smaller in diameter than the\r\nblack snake. This breed was numerous, and often difficult to see, they\r\nso nearly resembled the colour of some of the rocks. We also found some\r\nof an ashy-green and black, with deep crimson specks on the sides; as\r\nthey moved along in the sun the colours were most brilliant.\" Another,\r\nwhich Mr. Atkinson's companions killed, was of a dark-brown, with\r\ngreenish and red marks on the sides, and evidently very venomous. He\r\nmeasured five feet two inches and a half without his head, and four\r\ninches and a quarter round his body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE INHABITANTS OF THE STEPPES:--TARTARS, COSSACKS, KALMÜKS, KIRGHIZ,\r\nMONGOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Steppes of Tartary and Mongolia, interrupted, says Humboldt,[33] by\r\nchains of mountains of various aspects, separate the ruder peoples of\r\nNorthern Asia from the primitive races, which have been for ages\r\ncivilized, of Hindostan and Thibet. Their existence has influenced the\r\ndestinies of mankind in various important ways. They have rolled back\r\nthe populations towards the south, and more than the Himálaya, more than\r\nthe snow-crowned peaks of Serinagur and Goorkha, have raised an obstacle\r\nto the alliances of peoples, while opposing, in the north of Asia,\r\ninsuperable barriers to the refinement of manners and the genius of the\r\narts.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only as barriers that History should regard the plains of\r\nCentral Asia; they have several times let loose on earth a torrent of\r\ncalamity and devastation. The pastoral races of the Steppes--Mongols,\r\nGetæ, Alans, and Huns--have convulsed the world. If, in the course of\r\nages, intellectual culture has directed its course from east to west,\r\nlike the vivifying light of the sun, Barbarism at a later period has\r\nfollowed in the same track, when threatening to plunge all Europe into\r\ndarkness. A people of tawny shepherds, Tou-Kin (that is to say, Turkish)\r\nin origin, the Hioung-Nou, inhabited, under tents of skin, the elevated\r\nSteppe of the Gobi. Long formidable to the Chinese power, a horde of the\r\nHioung-Nou was driven back towards the south into Central Asia. The\r\nimpulse which they gave spread uninterruptedly even into the native\r\ncountry of the Fins, on the borders of the Oural, and thence the Huns,\r\nthe Avars, the Chasurs, and various mixtures of Asiatic races, poured\r\nforth in furious violence. The Hunnish hosts first appeared on the\r\nbanks of the Volga, then in Pannonia, and finally on the banks of the\r\nMarne, and on those of the Po, ravaging the beautiful fields where, from\r\nthe days of Antenor, the genius of man had accumulated its glorious\r\nmonuments. Thus from the Mongolian deserts blew a pestiferous wind,\r\nwhich choked even in the Cisalpine plains the delicate blossom of art,\r\nthe object of such tender and continual cares.\r\n\r\nOur English traveller, Atkinson, has called the Steppes \"the cradle of\r\ninvasions;\" and this not only because from their solitudes issued the\r\nhordes which devastated Europe in the first centuries of the Middle\r\nAges, but because Russia and Austria have found therein those truculent\r\nsoldiers of repulsive aspect who, in their hands, have become, even in\r\nour own day, the scourge of the free and civilized nations they would\r\nfain have subjugated.\r\n\r\nIn the present day the Steppes of Eastern Europe and of Asia are still\r\nthe asylum of savagery, if not of barbarism. The tribes scattered over\r\nthem are more or less closely allied to that fraction of the human\r\nfamily which ethnographists designate under the name of the \"Turanian.\"\r\nThose of the East belong exclusively to the Mongolian branch, and those\r\nof the West partly to the Mongolian and partly to the Turkish, more or\r\nless modified by their mixture with the Slave branch of the great\r\nCaucasian family. To all these peoples we commonly apply the term\r\nTartaro, or Tartars, which originally \"was a name of the Mongolic races,\r\nbut through their political ascendancy in Asia after Chingis-Khan (A.D.\r\n1227), it became usual to call all the tribes which were under Mongolian\r\nsway by the name of Tartar.\"[34] It now really belongs to the small\r\ntribe of Turkic origin which, after occupying Turkistan, has spread even\r\ninto the Crimea. We must distinguish from it, however, the Cossacks, or\r\nKosaks, who inhabit the Ukraine, the banks of the Don and the Dnieper,\r\nand who are more closely related to the Slave family than the Mongolian\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nWe shall pass in rapid review the principal hordes which inhabit the\r\nSteppes, from the western border to the eastern extremity of these\r\ndeserts.\r\n\r\nThe first tribe which we encounter on the shores of the Sea of Azov and\r\nthe Black Sea is that of the Tartar-Nogáis, who formerly lived\r\nnorth-east of the Caspian. \"Pressed by the Kalmüks, or Mongolic tribe,\r\nthe Nogáis advanced westward as far as Astrachan. Peter I. transferred\r\nthem thence to the north of the Caucasian mountains, where they still\r\ngraze their flocks on the shores of the Kuban and the Kuma.\" Of late\r\nyears, however, they have begun to settle themselves in permanent\r\nhabitations, owing to the exertions of a French emigré, Count Maison,\r\nwho was appointed their governor in 1808.\r\n\r\nThey now occupy (according to Madame Hommaire de Hell) all the territory\r\ncomprised between the Sea of Azov and the river of Malochnia-Vodi. They\r\nnumber about 32,000 souls, spread over seventy villages. Their huts are\r\nsmall, with a roof constructed of beams of timber, covered with reeds,\r\nwhich are afterwards loaded with clay and ashes. They occupy themselves\r\nwholly in rearing horses and cattle. The horses of the Kalmük-Kirghiz\r\nbreed are of moderate stature, but nimble and robust. All the year round\r\nthey roam across the plains, and in winter seek their provender beneath\r\nthe snow. The horned cattle are small and puny, the cows yield but a\r\npoor supply of milk, and are of scarcely any value.\r\n\r\nThe aged Nogáis shave the hair entirely off; the young people preserve a\r\nsingle tuft on the top of the head. This custom compels them to wear\r\nconstantly a bonnet of wool or lamb's skin. A short caftan over a shirt\r\nof cotton or woollen, bound round the waist by a leather belt; loose,\r\nwide trousers; in winter a pelisse of sheep's skin and a kind of hood\r\nenveloping the head and shoulders, compose the dress of the males. As\r\nfor the women, they wear above the chemise a caftan of cloth, girded\r\nabout the form by a large belt ornamented with great metal buckles; they\r\nlikewise figure in Turkish trousers and slippers, with a long white veil\r\nfastened round the head, and allowed to fall upon the shoulders; small\r\nsilver rings adorn the fingers and the nose; heavy ear-drops hang from\r\ntheir ears, the two being frequently linked together by a chain passing\r\nunder the chin. The young girls dress their hair in a multiplicity of\r\ncurls, and instead of the veil wear a small red fez, garnished with\r\npieces of metal and all kinds of trinkets.\r\n\r\nThe Nogáis are Mohammedans, of the sect called Sunnites (or believers in\r\nthe \"Sunna,\" the sayings and aphorisms traditionally attributed to the\r\nProphet). Their name is derived from that of their first chief, the\r\ngrandson of Chingis-Khán, who, about 1260, declared himself independent\r\nof the Kapchakian empire, and established himself with his warriors on\r\nthe borders of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Kosaks (or Cossacks) are, as we have said, Slaves rather than\r\nTartars. They have blue eyes, red hair, thick lips, a flat nose. Nimble,\r\nrobust, indefatigable, skilful horsemen, they furnish the Russian army\r\nwith a formidable host of irregulars. Some have fixed their homes in the\r\ntowns, but the majority inhabit the villages or _stanitzas_ scattered\r\nover the Steppes. Very few are agriculturists. Either they devote\r\nthemselves to breeding horses and cattle, or live on the small pension\r\nallowed them for their military services. Nearly all the young and hardy\r\nof the males have no other trade but that of arms. The Cossack\r\nchieftains, their Hetmans, or Attamans, derive their authority directly\r\nfrom the Czar. Their religion is that of the Russian Greek Church; and\r\nthey are, we believe, the only Christians in the entire zone of the\r\nSteppes.\r\n\r\nBold and resolute robbers in time of war, the Cossacks \"at home\" are\r\npeaceable, kindly-natured, and more honest than the Russian Mongiks. The\r\nerroneous ideas which still prevail respecting their character are\r\nmainly due to French prejudices, excited by the disastrous events of\r\n1814 and 1815, when the jingle of their arms resounded in the streets of\r\nParis. But they are not really so black as they have been painted. The\r\ntraveller passes through the country which they inhabit with the utmost\r\nsecurity, and is received in their stanitzas with a hospitable welcome.\r\n\r\nThese stanitzas, if we may credit Madame Hommaire de Hell, present a far\r\nmore agreeable appearance than the Russian villages. They consist of\r\nsmall wooden houses, gaily painted. There is but one story, which is\r\nsurrounded by a miniature gallery, and seems expressly constructed to\r\nplease the eye. The interior is exceedingly neat and pretty, indicating\r\nan intelligence and an idea of comfort which the Russians never exhibit.\r\nYou will find it enriched with towels, dishes of delft ware, forks, and\r\nall the most necessary utensils. Usually two huts are built in one\r\nblock; the first, which we have just described, is occupied for a summer\r\nresidence; it contains, generally, one room hung with paper of a lively\r\ndesign, and adorned with images, flowers, and trophies of arms, which is\r\nreserved for state occasions and the entertainment of strangers. The\r\nsecond hut, built of dried clay, resembles the Russian _kates_,\r\nconsisting of a single chamber, where all the household huddle together\r\nduring the winter to shelter themselves from the cold.\r\n\r\nThe traveller seldom sees in these stanitzas any but women and children.\r\nWith the exception of a few gray veterans, who have purchased by forty\r\nyears of service the right of dying under the home-roof, the entire male\r\npopulation is under arms. Thus all the work falls upon the shoulders of\r\nthe women, who must repair the houses, cleanse and dry the furs, take\r\ncare of the children, and watch the cattle.\r\n\r\nThe Cossack soldiers, regulars and irregulars, are the guardians of the\r\nSteppes. To them is intrusted the security of the traveller, who is much\r\nexposed to the attacks of nomadic Turkomen, whose only occupation is\r\nrobbery. The surveillance of these immense plains is not so difficult,\r\nhowever, nor does it necessitate so large a force as you might suppose.\r\nSmall watch-posts, or platforms, of extreme simplicity of design, are\r\nraised at intervals on the higher grounds; they consist of four long\r\nstout poles planted in the earth, and supporting a timber floor, which\r\nis sometimes sheltered by a roof of timber. These are the observatories,\r\nthe prospect-towers of the Cossacks, who can thus obtain a survey over\r\nan immense sweep of country, and exchange signals with one another. The\r\nhorsemen always remain stationed under the platform, ready to leap into\r\nthe saddle and to gallop wherever their presence may be required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COSSACK HORSEMEN IN THE STEPPES.]\r\n\r\nIn the Steppes of the Caspian Sea the Cossacks give place to the\r\nKalmüks, or Olöts, a people of the Mongolic race, who originally\r\ninhabited Turkistan, but abandoned that country, in 1778, for the banks\r\nof the Volga. Their life is wholly nomadic. They encamp under tents\r\ncalled _kibitkas_, formed of a trellis-work of wood covered with thick\r\nfelt. In stature they do not often exceed the middle height; they are\r\nthin and ugly, with a swarthy skin, a large flat countenance, little\r\neyes, broad nose, thick lips, and frizzled beard. They are inoffensive,\r\nhospitable like all Eastern people, but idle and cunning. Their costume\r\ndiffers but little from that of the Tartars-Nogáis. They profess the\r\nLamaii religion, and obey the chiefs whom they themselves elect, and who\r\nbear the title of khans. The Russian Government levies among the Kalmük\r\ntribes encamped on its territory a body of irregular troops, whom it\r\nemploys in the defence of its eastern and southern frontiers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Madame de Hell, the Kalmüks are as friendly as the Cossacks\r\nin their reception of a stranger. \"The last encampment,\" she says,\r\n\"where we passed the night, appeared to us one of the most considerable\r\nwhich we had hitherto met with. The country, almost transformed, was no\r\nlonger saddened by the great sandy plains of the Caspian Sea and the\r\nManitch.... Herds of horses, camels, and oxen furrowed the surface of\r\nthe Steppe, announcing the wealth of the hordes to which they belonged.\r\nNo hostile manifestation on the part of the latter occurred to disturb\r\nour security. Happy in receiving us in the very midst of their tents,\r\nthese good Kalmüks never attempted to rob us even of the most trifling\r\narticle. Their desires and their wants are so limited! To tame a wild\r\nhorse, to roam from one Steppe to another on their camels, to smoke, and\r\nto drink _koumis_, to shut out the cold airs of winter with smoke and\r\nashes, and to observe devoutly the superstitious practices of a religion\r\nwhich they cannot understand--such is their whole life.\"\r\n\r\nAt intervals, the traveller who crosses the Steppes of the Caspian\r\nencounters with astonishment, in the most dreary localities, far from\r\nevery Cossack village and Kalmük kibitka, a group of men, women, and\r\nchildren with bronzed complexions, with features strongly defined,\r\ncovered with squalid and grotesque rags, dragging their naked feet over\r\nthe damp and burning soil, and leading small vehicles loaded with\r\nimplements and utensils of every kind. He easily recognizes in these\r\nbeings of sinister mien, audacious mendicants, skilful thieves,\r\nmusicians, blacksmiths, conjurers--what shall I say?--the _débris_, in a\r\nword, of that once great, and perhaps powerful race, now so degraded and\r\ncorrupt, whose problematical history is the despair of the scholar. The\r\nscorn and mistrust of every nation--impatient of all discipline, all\r\neducation--without law, without religion, without country--these men\r\nspeak a language which none can understand. Of their real name they are\r\nthemselves ignorant, and they accept with indifference that which is\r\nimposed upon them in different countries: in the East, _Romany_; in\r\nMoldavia, _Tsiganes_; in Italy, _Zingari_; in Spain, _Gilanos_; in\r\nFrance, _Bohemians_; in England, _Gipsies_.[35] The Germans call them\r\n_Zigeuner_; the Dutch, expressively but intolerantly, _Heathens_; the\r\nPersians, _Sisech_; the Hindus, _Kavachee_; the Danes and Swedes,\r\n_Tatars_; and the Arabs, _Haramé_. Their origin has been a theme of\r\nspeculation for centuries, and all that seems certain, after a vast\r\namount of research and discussion, is, that the cradle of the race was\r\nIndia. To what Indian people they should be affiliated is still\r\ndoubtful; whether to the Zuts or Djalts of the north; the Tshingani, who\r\ndwelt near the mouth of the Indus; or the Tshandalas, chronicled by name\r\nin the laws of Menou.\r\n\r\nWe know that their first immigration into Europe occurred about the\r\nclose of the tenth century, for we find them referred to in a paraphrase\r\nof the book of Genesis, written by an Austrian monk, about 1122. They\r\nare there spoken of as \"Ishmaelites and braziers, who go peddling\r\nthrough the wide world, having neither house nor home, cheating the\r\npeople with their tricks, and secretly deceiving mankind.\" In the\r\nfourteenth century a considerable body settled in Wallachia, Hungary,\r\nand the island of Cyprus. Next, they invaded Germany, broke into\r\nSwitzerland, and appeared in Bologna and other Italian cities. Like a\r\nbesieging army they set down before Paris in 1427, but were not suffered\r\nto enter its precincts. A few years later they crossed into England, and\r\ngradually they overspread the whole of Europe. Their own account of\r\nthemselves represented that they came from \"Little Egypt;\" that about\r\nfour thousand of their number had been compulsorily baptized by the\r\nking, and condemned to seven years' wanderings, while the remainder had\r\nbeen slain. At first, their wealth, their pomp, and their supposed\r\npenitence secured them a favourable reception; but when their wealth\r\nwas dissipated, their pomp decayed, and their penitence discovered to be\r\na sham, a storm of obloquy broke over their heads. Every European\r\ngovernment levelled the most arbitrary decrees against them, which\r\ncontinued in force down to the middle of the eighteenth century. Various\r\nattempts have since been made to civilize and incorporate them with the\r\ngeneral body of the population, but these have obtained a very limited\r\nsuccess. They still remain a race apart, with their own language (Romany\r\nTschib), their own traditions, their own customs, their distinct\r\npersonal characteristics. They still remain a race cursed with the curse\r\nof perpetual restlessness; a mysterious impulse constrains them to\r\nwander; they live secluded from all other peoples; an atmosphere of\r\nsecrecy enshrouds their inner life, their language, and their creed.\r\nThey are gifted with a remarkable love of and capacity for music, and a\r\nstrange wild charm invests their own gipsy-melodies. Their character is\r\na grotesque combination of the most opposite qualities; for they are\r\nbrave and yet cowardly; revengeful, yet loyal; treacherous, yet capable\r\nof the most passionate attachment; indolent, yet energetic; chaste, yet\r\nfond of licentious songs and dances. In a word, they are a problem to\r\nthe ethnologist, the moralist, and the historical student; and fence\r\nthemselves about with so impenetrable a reserve, that we may well doubt\r\nwhether the full truth respecting them will ever be ascertained.[36]\r\n\r\nThe Tsiganes or Romany are very numerous in Southern Russia. They pass\r\nfrom town to town, from village to village, sometimes begging or\r\nstealing, sometimes exercising their peculiar trades and industries, and\r\nproviding for their wants more honestly. They never establish themselves\r\npermanently in any place. They halt wherever the evening shades may\r\nchance to overtake them, stretch a few fragments of woollen stuff across\r\nthe poles of their vehicles to serve for tents, kindle a fire with\r\nherbs, twigs, and dry branches, partly to cook their food, and partly to\r\nscare away the wild beasts, and fling themselves down pell-mell to\r\nsleep on mats or the naked earth. When morning dawns, they resume their\r\nlife-long march--giving no thought to the future, no dream to the\r\npast--without object, hope, or purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIGHT ENCAMPMENT OF GIPSIES IN THE STEPPE.]\r\n\r\nThe Steppes of the interior of Asia, from the Aral river to the Ala-Tau\r\nmountains, are occupied by the great nation of the Kirghiz, who have,\r\nfrom time immemorial, been divided into the Great, Middle, and Little\r\nHordes. To the former belongs the territory north of the Ala-Tau, with\r\nportions of China and Tartary. They are subject to the sovereigns of the\r\ncountries in which they dwell. The Middle Horde inhabits the district\r\nbetween the Ishim, Irtish, Lake Balkhush, and Khokan. The Little (and\r\nfar most numerous) Horde wanders over the grassy plains bounded by the\r\nYamba and the Ural, Turkistan (now a Russian province), and the country\r\nof the Middle Horde (or Siberian Kirghizes). Altogether, the Kirghizes\r\nnumber upwards of one and a quarter million of souls. They are of\r\nTurco-Tartaric origin, and Southern Siberia is their mother country.[37]\r\n\r\nThough owing a nominal allegiance to the Russian Czar and the Chinese\r\nEmperor, they are virtually independent, and obey only their sultans or\r\nchiefs. They are frequently at war. Many live wholly by brigandage;\r\nsuddenly descending, under cover of night, upon the richest _aouls_, or\r\nvillages, slaying all who resist, and carrying off horses, cattle, and\r\nall objects of value, and men, women and children, whom they sell as\r\nslaves. These nocturnal razzias are designated, in the Kirghiz language,\r\n_barantas_.\r\n\r\nThe _yourt_, or tent of these nomades, resembles the kibitka of the\r\nKalmüks. We borrow a description of one belonging to a Kirghiz chief\r\nfrom Mr. Atkinson's entertaining pages.\r\n\r\n\"It was formed,\" he says,[38] \"of willow trellis-work, put together with\r\nuntanned strips of skin, made into compartments which fold up. It was a\r\ncircle of thirty-four feet in diameter, five feet high to the springing\r\nof the dome, and twelve feet in the centre. This dome is formed of bent\r\nrods of willow, one and a quarter inch diameter, put into the\r\nmortice-hole of a ring about four feet across, which secures the top of\r\nthe dome, admits light, and lets out the smoke. The lower ends of the\r\nwillow-rods are tied with leathern thongs to the top of the trellis-work\r\nat the sides, which renders it quite strong and secure. The whole is\r\nthen covered with large sheets of _voilock_, made of wool and camel's\r\nhair, fitting close, making it water-tight and warm. A small aperture in\r\nthe trellis-work forms a doorway, over which a piece of _voilock_ hangs\r\ndown and closes it; but in the daytime this is rolled up and secured on\r\nthe top of the _yourt_.\r\n\r\n\"The furniture and fittings of these dwellings are exceedingly simple;\r\nthe fire being made on the ground in the centre of the _yourt_, directly\r\nopposite to the door _voilocks_ are spread: on these stand sundry boxes,\r\nwhich contain the different articles of clothing, pieces of Chinese\r\nsilk, tea, dried fruits, _ambas_ of silver (small squares, about two and\r\na half inches long, one inch and a half wide, and about three-tenths of\r\nan inch thick). Some of the Kirghiz possess large quantities of these\r\n_ambas_, which are carefully hoarded up. Above these boxes are bales of\r\nBokharian and Persian carpets, some of great beauty and value. In\r\nanother part of the _yourt_ is the large _koumis_ sack, completely\r\ncovered up with _voilock_ to keep it warm and aid the fermentation.\r\n\r\n\"And near this bag stands a large leathern bottle, sometimes holding\r\nfour gallons, often much ornamented; so are the small bottles made to\r\ncarry on the saddle. In another place stands the large iron caldron, and\r\nthe trivet on which it is placed when used for cooking in the _yourt_.\r\nThere are usually half-a-dozen Chinese wooden bowls, often beautifully\r\npainted and japanned. These are used to drink the _koumis_ from; some of\r\nthem hold three pints, others more. On entering a Kirghiz _yourt_ in\r\nsummer, one of the Chinese bowls full of _koumis_ is presented to each\r\nguest. It is considered impolite to return the vessel before emptying\r\nit, and a good Kirghiz is never guilty of this impropriety.\r\n\r\n\"The saddles are placed on the bales of carpets. Rich horse-trappings\r\nbeing highly prized by the wealthy Kirghiz, many of their saddles are\r\nbeautiful and costly. If of Kirghiz workmanship, they are decorated with\r\nsilver inlaid on iron, in chaste ornamental designs, and have velvet\r\ncushions; the bridles and other trappings covered with small iron plates\r\ninlaid in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\"Leathern thongs and ropes made of camel's hair are hung up on the\r\ntrellis-work, common saddles, saddle-cloths, and leathern _tchimbar_.\r\nThis part of a Kirghiz costume is frequently made of black velvet,\r\nsplendidly embroidered with silk, more especially the back elevation.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the dwelling of a Kirghiz chief in the Steppe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KIRGHIZ AOUL OR VILLAGER.]\r\n\r\nThe national garment of the Kirghiz is the _khalat_, a kind of pelisse,\r\nvery long and very full, with large sleeves, in silk or cashmere, and of\r\nthe most dazzling colours; but the poorer warriors substitute for this\r\nstate dress a horse-skin jacket. Breeches fastened below the hips by a\r\ngirdle of wool or cashmere, high-heeled madder-coloured boots, and a\r\nfox-skin cap, rising into a cone on the top, and lined inside with\r\ncrimson cloth, complete his costume. His weapons are the spear, the gun,\r\nthe axe, and the cutlass. The women wear a long and copious robe, and a\r\nveil of numerous folds, surmounted by a lofty calico head-dress, a part\r\nof which falls over the shoulders and covers up the neck.\r\n\r\nThe Kirghiz are fierce, cunning, and often cruel, but the life of a\r\nguest is esteemed sacred. They have not so much respect, however, for\r\nhis property, and do not always resist the temptation of plundering him\r\nof any article which suits their fancy. Equestrian exercises and\r\nfalconry are their favourite amusements. They love the chase, indeed,\r\nwith a true sportsman's passion; they love it for itself rather than for\r\nthe game it secures, for they have no greater dainty than a dish of\r\nmutton. Their mode of preparing this viand is exquisitely simple. They\r\ncontent themselves with skinning the animal, cutting it into quarters,\r\nand plunging it into a pot, where they keep it boiling in a great\r\nquantity of water for a couple of hours. Generally, to prevent the loss\r\nof any portion, they cook with the meat the animal's intestines, without\r\neven taking the trouble of cleaning them. The guests arrange themselves\r\nin a circle on carpets of felt; the men in the foremost rank, the women\r\nand children behind them. The smoking quarters of mutton are removed\r\nfrom the pot; each man draws his knife, slashes off a slice, eats a\r\nportion, and passes the remainder to his wife and children, who speedily\r\nfinish it. The dogs come in for the bones. Afterwards, bowls of the\r\nliquor in which the meat has been boiled are handed round, and not a\r\nKirghiz but swallows the greasy broth with delight. This broth, koumis,\r\nand tea are his customary drink; the tea is not made in the European\r\nfashion, but becomes a veritable soup, prepared with milk, flour,\r\nbutter, and salt. In every well-to-do aoul the women keep constantly\r\nupon the fire a vessel full of this beverage, which they offer to\r\nvisitors, just as the Turks serve up coffee, the Spaniards, chocolate,\r\nand the French, wine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Great Horde, in the government of Irkutsk (Siberia),\r\nwe meet with the Agro-Mongolian people of the Buriäts, numbering about\r\n35,000 families. They are given to Chamanism, an idolatrous worship\r\nwidely spread through Eastern Siberia. Their supreme divinity inhabits\r\nthe sun, and reigns over a host of lesser gods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally, between Lake Baïkal and the Altaï Mountains to the north, the\r\nAla-Tau mountains west, the Great Wall of China south, and the sea east,\r\nstretches the immense territory commonly known as Mongolia, and\r\ninhabited in part by the tribes which represent the Mongol type in all\r\nits primitive purity. This great desert, where grassy lands alternate\r\nwith dry and sandy or saline plains, was formerly the seat of a\r\nflourishing empire, established by Chingis-Khán in 1227, which gave\r\nbirth to the three Mongol kingdoms of Krim, Kasan, and Astrachan.\r\nMongolic empires, at a later period, arose in China, Turkistan, Siberia,\r\nSouthern Russia, and Persia. The Mongolian dynasty lost its hold on\r\nChina in 1360, and a century later was driven out of Russia. In Central\r\nAsia it was rehabilitated in 1369, by the illustrious Timur; but a\r\nhundred years afterwards the empire was again crushed by its own weight.\r\nBaber, a descendant of Timur, conquered India, and erected there a\r\nMongolian throne, which endured until the soldiers of Great Britain\r\ndefeated Tippoo Saib and captured Delhi. Most Mongolic tribes are now\r\nunder the rule of the nations whom they once had conquered, the Tungusic\r\nsovereigns of China, the Russian Czars, and the Turkish Sultans.[39]\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Mongolian grandeur are still visible in those solitary\r\ncities, which the traveller in the desert discovers half overwhelmed in\r\nsand. \"We met,\" says the Abbé Huc, \"with an imposing and majestic\r\nmemorial of antiquity. It was a great city, desolate and abandoned. The\r\ncrenellated ramparts, the watch-towers, the four great gates, situated\r\nat the four cardinal points, were all in perfect preservation; but all\r\nwas buried three-fourths deep in the ground, and covered with a thick\r\nsward. We entered its vast precinct with a profound emotion of awe and\r\nmelancholy. We saw neither _débris_ nor ruins, but only the outline of a\r\nbeautiful and spacious city, wrapped in grass and weeds as in a funeral\r\nshroud.\" Similar relics of the past are scattered over the deserts of\r\nMongolia, but everything connected with their origin is enveloped in\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nThe Mongolian family includes several branches, each subdivided into\r\ntribes, obeying chiefs of unequal rank. The most numerous people are the\r\nKalkas, who occupy all the northern districts. The Mongols of the south,\r\ndwelling near the Great Wall, have been affected in their habits and\r\nmanners by the neighbourhood of the Chinese; they have become\r\nindustrious, and engage eagerly in commercial affairs. But the Kalkas,\r\nand the other tribes of the Great Gobi, are still nomadic, reckless, and\r\nindolent. Their religion is Buddhism; they profess for its head, the\r\nliving Buddha or Great Lama (Dalai-lama, or Ocean-priest--_i.e._, wide\r\nas the ocean), a reverence and a blind obedience, which they also pay to\r\nthe inferior lamas. \"Under an external aspect of savagery,\" says Huc,\r\n\"the Mongol hides a character full of mildness and kindly feeling; he\r\npasses suddenly from the wildest and most extravagant gaiety to a\r\nsadness which has nothing forbidding. Timid to excess in his ordinary\r\nlife, when impelled by fanaticism or revenge, he displays an\r\nirresistible impetuosity of courage. He is simple and credulous as a\r\nchild, and passionately loves stories and legends of the marvellous.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mongols are ugly in feature, of the middle height, agile and robust;\r\ntheir sight is wonderfully keen, their hearing of an extraordinary\r\nacuteness.[40] Their wants are restricted to the indispensable\r\nnecessities of life; of luxury they have no conception; their few\r\npleasures are easily enjoyed; their instincts lead them rather in the\r\npath of good than of evil, and their defects, to use an expression of M.\r\nHuc's, are those of ill-trained children. They need, perhaps, but a\r\nwell-directed impulse to develop their intellect, and guide them onward\r\nto a far higher civilization. In the great human family, it is true that\r\nas yet they do but fill the children's place, and it is impossible to\r\nsay whether their national genius is capable of any great or lasting\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n_THE DESERTS OF SAND:--THE DESERTS OF EUROPE AND AFRICA._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE RAINLESS DESERT--THE BED OF A SEA--THE DEAD SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sandy Deserts may with equal, nay, with greater accuracy, be\r\nentitled Salt Deserts, Rainless Deserts, Seas of Sand; for they present\r\nat one and the same time all these characters, and the three last,\r\nthough less generally known than the first, are the most essential.\r\n\r\nThe soil is generally covered with a thick stratum of sand; but in\r\nseveral places it also exhibits great walls of rock, and in others\r\nmasses of rolled or shattered pebbles. The subsoil is nearly always of a\r\ngypseous or calcareous nature, rarely clayey; wherever it is porous and\r\npermeable, it is impregnated with salt, which rises to the surface, or\r\nis held in solution in the subterranean basins of water, the thermal\r\nsprings, the ponds, and the lakes. The saline efflorescences of the\r\ndeserts of Persia and Oriental Asia not only suffice for the wants of\r\nthe inhabitants, but supply the great Asiatic caravans with their\r\nprincipal article of exportation.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of the Deserts is not less dry than their sands and\r\nrocks. The sky wears a perennial azure, more or less veiled in haze, or\r\nrather spotted with a few clouds. Johnstone represents them, in his\r\nadmirable \"Physical Atlas,\" by two white unequal bands, characterised\r\nas \"Rainless Districts.\" Of these the larger occupies all the northern\r\nregion of Africa, and the greater portion of Arabia, Syria, Persia, and\r\nBeloochistan, embracing an area of 80° of longitude over 17° of\r\nlatitude. The other extends over the table-lands of Thibet and the Gobi.\r\nIt is in form an irregular ellipsis, obliquely inclined from south-west\r\nto north-east. Its length is about 1100 leagues; its width, 450. From\r\nthe former it is only separated by a narrow belt. In the region marked\r\nby these two species rain is an extraordinary phenomenon; several years\r\nwill pass without the clouds shedding a single drop of water. This\r\npermanent, and nearly absolute, aridity, establishes a very marked\r\ndifference between the Deserts properly so called, and the Landes,\r\nSteppes, and Prairies, condemned as these are during the hot season to a\r\ndeadly dryness, but in winter inundated with rain or covered with snow;\r\nand in spring converted into immense marshes, where an exuberant\r\nvegetation makes its appearance, frequently capable of resisting the\r\naction of the summer sun and the withering winds.\r\n\r\nIn the Rainless Districts vegetation is a nullity; it becomes reduced to\r\na very small number of saline plants and dwarf bushes, nourished by the\r\nbrackish waters which, the soil conceals. Finally, the desert region may\r\nnot only be compared to a sea in its aspect and immensity, but it is a\r\ntrue sea, or at least the bed of an ancient sea, which formerly\r\ncommunicated, and, perhaps, was confounded with the Mediterranean, and\r\nwhose drying up, though still incomplete, took place at a recent\r\ngeological epoch. We may reasonably conclude that, owing to a series of\r\ngradual upheavals, this sea was at first broken up into vast lagoons;\r\nthat most of these successively disappeared, but not without leaving\r\nsome certain evidences of the primitive submersion of the continent. \"If\r\nwe might hazard a conjecture,\" says a recent writer,[41] \"it would be\r\nthat the same convulsions and upheavals which at the close of the\r\ntertiary epoch indented the southern coasts of Europe, at the same time\r\ndrained the ocean which hitherto had rolled over the plains of the\r\nSahara, and submerged the low-lying lands, which probably united the\r\nCanaries and Madeira to the mainland.\" To a similar cause must be\r\nattributed the existence of the subterranean waters, springs, ponds, and\r\nsalt lakes, of which I have already spoken, and of the inland seas--the\r\nCaspian, the Sea of Aral, and the Dead Sea; while the Black Sea and its\r\noffshoots, the Sea of Azov and the Sea of Marmora, must have had the\r\nsame origin. I shall discuss this subject further when describing the\r\nGreat Sahara.\r\n\r\nIn Eastern and Central Asia, the Sandy or Salt Deserts alternate with\r\nthe Steppes, and with lands susceptible of a certain amount of\r\ncultivation. The vast region which geographers designate the Great Gobi,\r\nor the Shamo, is intersected by many grassy Steppes and even by fertile\r\nfields, where the sedentary Mongols, and especially the Artons, yearly\r\nsow and gather hemp, millet, and buckwheat. The sombre picture of \"a\r\nbarren plain of shifting sand blown into high ridges where the summer\r\nsun is scorching, no rain falls, and when thick fog occurs it is only\r\nthe precursor of fierce winds,\"[42] is true only of special districts,\r\nsuch as the Han-hai, or \"Dry Sea,\" or the Desert of Sarkha. There, for\r\ninstance, we meet with no other vegetable than the salsolæ, or\r\nsalt-worts, which flourish around the small saline pools. Of these\r\npools, when seen from a distance, Mr. Atkinson notices a remarkable\r\ncharacteristic: the salt crystals which accrete upon their banks\r\nfrequently reflect the orange or crimson hues of flowers, and resemble\r\nglowing rubies set in a rich mounting.\r\n\r\nAs we advance in a south-easterly direction, we find the features of the\r\ndesert region more prominently marked.\r\n\r\nImmense plains of sand, with a bare and brackish surface, called\r\n_Bejaban_, traverse the whole of Persia, from the Caspian Sea to the\r\nIndus. They comprise the Deserts of Kerusan, Seistan, Beloochistan, and\r\nMekran, rich in salts with a basis of soda. \"The coasts of the Persian\r\nGulf,\" as Mrs. Somerville remarks, \"are burning hot sandy solitudes, so\r\ncompletely barren, that the country from Bassora to the Indus, a\r\ndistance of 1200 miles, is nearly a sterile waste. Three-tenths of\r\nPersia is a desert, and the tableland is nearly a wide scene of\r\ndesolation. A great salt-desert occupies 27,000 square miles between\r\nIrak and Khorasan, of which the soil is a stiff clay, covered with\r\nefflorescence of common salt and nitre, often an inch thick, varied only\r\nby a few saline plants and patches of verdure in the hollows. This\r\ndreary waste joins the large sandy and equally dreary desert of Kerman.\r\nKhelat, the capital of Beloochistan, is 7000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea; round it there is cultivation, but the greater part of that country\r\nis a lifeless plain, over which the brick-red sand is drifted by the\r\nnorth wind into ridges like the waves of the sea, often twelve feet\r\nhigh, without a vestige of vegetation. The blast of the desert, whose\r\nhot and pestilential breath is fatal to man and animals, renders these\r\ndismal sands impassable at certain seasons.\"\r\n\r\nThe Desert of Mekran is separated from that of Moultan by the Indus.\r\nThat which lies to the east of Kom, in the centre of Persia, is more\r\nthan sixty leagues in extent. Of Persia, M. Forgues observes that the\r\nactual reality differs strangely from those glowing eastern landscapes\r\nwhich poets and romancists love to paint. Even in those provinces where\r\nthe winter rains encourage the growth of vegetation, the scene would\r\nhardly remind the traveller of\r\n\r\n    \"That delightful province of the Sun.\r\n     The first of Persian lands he shines upon,\r\n     Where all the loveliest children of his beam.\r\n     Flowerets and fruits, blush over every stream.\"[43]\r\n\r\n\"To bare, dry mountain-ridges,\" says M. Forgues, \"succeed plains,\r\nsometimes incrusted with hard clay, sometimes clothed with thick sand.\r\nAt the outset of spring, in the months of April and May, the country is\r\ncoloured with some softer tints, the grass breaks here and there through\r\nthe granite and the gravel; but in the first summer heats everything\r\ngrows dry, and the soil resumes its monotonously brown or gray livery.\r\nWater fails for cultivation, which in the best districts is confined to\r\na few scattered oases. In these vast spaces, when the eye surveys them\r\nfrom some mountain-crest, there occurs nothing to arrest the gaze; and\r\nwhen once the spring has past, the cultured fields become blended with\r\nthose which the plough has suffered to lie fallow, the clay-built\r\nvillages with the earth of which their walls are constructed. In these\r\nconfused landscapes even a considerable town scarcely traces its blurred\r\noutline among the accumulated ruins in whose centre it persists in\r\nliving, and whose extent attests its decadence. It is a marvel if, on\r\narriving at the limit of these monotonous plains, the traveller\r\ndistinguishes them from the deserts to whose threshold they have\r\ngenerally conducted him. He only recognizes the latter by the dazzling\r\ngleam of their saline efflorescence, which stretches far out of sight,\r\nand where at intervals abruptly projects some mass of ebon-black rock,\r\ntransformed by the solar refraction, and assuming in quick succession\r\nthe most fantastic aspects.\"\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the inland seas and salt lakes which testify to the\r\nprimitive submersion of the whole region of the Great Deserts. Let us\r\npursue our route towards the west, and we shall encounter the most\r\nremarkable of these vestiges of a remote past.\r\n\r\nFirst, I shall speak of the Dead Sea, the Lake Asphaltes, which Dean\r\nStanley justly designates \"one of the most remarkable spots in the\r\nworld,\" and which, as the reader knows, is situated in the south of\r\nPalestine, at a short distance from Jerusalem. It is true that \"a great\r\nmass of legend and exaggeration, partly the effect, partly the cause, of\r\nthe old belief that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were buried under\r\nthe Dead Sea, has been gradually removed in recent years. The glittering\r\nsurface of the lake, with the thin mist of its own evaporations floating\r\nover its surface, will now no more be taken for a gloomy sea, sending\r\nforth sulphurous exhalations. The birds which pass over it without\r\ninjury have long ago destroyed the belief that no living creature could\r\nsurvive the baneful atmosphere which hung upon its waters.\" But still,\r\nfor the scientific no less than for the historical student, it possesses\r\nan absorbing interest. It is the most depressed sheet of water in the\r\nworld, lying fully thirteen hundred feet below the level of the\r\nMediterranean: as the Lake Sir-i-Kol, where the Oxus rises\r\n\r\n    \"In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,\"\r\n\r\nis the most elevated.[44] \"Its basin,\" to quote Dean Stanley's graphic\r\ndescription, \"is a steaming caldron--a bowl which, from the peculiar\r\ntemperature and deep cavity in which it is situated, can never be filled\r\nto overflowing. The river Jordan, itself exposed to the same withering\r\ninfluences, is not copious enough to furnish a supply equal to the\r\ndemand made by the rapid evaporation. Its excessive saltness is even\r\nmore remarkable than its deep depression. This peculiarity is, it is\r\nbelieved, mainly occasioned by the huge barrier of fossil-salt at its\r\nsouth-west corner, and heightened by the rapid evaporation of the fresh\r\nwater poured into it. Other like phenomena, though in a less striking\r\nform, exist elsewhere. But, without entering into its wider relations,\r\nthis aspect is important, as that which most forcibly impressed the\r\nsacred writers. To them it was 'the salt sea,' and nothing more. They\r\nexhibit hardly a trace of the exaggerations of later times. And so it is\r\nin fact. It is not gloom, but desolation, which is the prevailing\r\ncharacteristic of the Sea of Death. Follow the course of the Jordan to\r\nits end. How different from the first burst of its waters in Mount\r\nHermon, amongst the groves of Dan and Paneas! How different from the\r\n'riotous prodigality of life' which has marked its downward course,\r\nalmost to the very termination of its existence! Gradually, within the\r\nlast mile from the Dead Sea, its verdure dies away, and the river melts\r\ninto its grave in a tame and sluggish stream; still, however, of\r\nsufficient force to carry its brown waters far into the bright green\r\nsea. Along the desert shore the white crust of salt indicates the cause\r\nof sterility. Thus the few living creatures which the Jordan washes down\r\ninto the waters of the sea are destroyed. Hence arises the unnatural\r\nbuoyancy and the intolerable nausea to taste and touch, which raise to\r\nthe highest pitch the contrast between its clear, bitter waves, and the\r\nsoft, fresh, turbid stream of its parent river. Strewn along its\r\ndesolate margin lie the most striking memorials of this last conflict of\r\nlife and death: trunks and branches of trees, torn down from the\r\nthickets of the river-jungle by the violence of the Jordan, thrust out\r\ninto the sea, and thrown up again by its waves, dead and barren as\r\nitself. The dead beach shelves gradually into the calm waters. A deep\r\nhaze--that which to earlier ages gave the appearance of the 'smoke going\r\nup for ever and ever'--veils its southern extremity, and almost gives it\r\nthe dim horizon of a real sea. In the nearer view rises the low island\r\nclose to its northern end, and the long promontory projecting from the\r\neastern side, which divides it into its two unequal parts. This is all\r\nthat I saw, and all that most pilgrims and travellers have seen, of the\r\nDead Sea.\"[45]\r\n\r\nThe sinister aspect of the valley of the Jordan, especially at the\r\nembouchure of the river, impresses itself on the mind of every\r\nspectator. There the traveller finds the path narrowed between two\r\nabrupt gigantic walls. On the right rises the Arabian chain, black and\r\nperpendicular; on the left, the Judæan range, less elevated, more\r\nirregular, and resembling a dismantled ruin. \"The valley comprised\r\nbetween these two chains,\" says the Père Laorty-Hadji, \"exhibits a soil\r\nclosely resembling the bed of a sea which has long been dry. You can\r\ndiscern but a few stunted trees. Ruined towns and castles appear in the\r\ndistance. At the moment of flinging itself into the Dead Sea, the Jordan\r\nitself, traversing a muddy soil, changes its physiognomy and colour. It\r\nseems to drag reluctantly, towards the motionless lake, a burden of slow\r\nand tawny waters. The shores of the Dead Sea are low on the east and\r\nwest; to the north and south high mountains enclose it.\" \"These\r\nmountains, separated by a formidable cleft, exhibit their beds of red\r\nsandstone, overlain by a thick stratum of compact chalk, interrupted by\r\nsilicious fragments. One is surprised not to see a volcanic crater, when\r\nall about, in this convulsed site, the action of fire is visible--the\r\nviolent, bitter struggle of the two Neptunian and Plutonian principles,\r\nwhich, during the geological eras, contended for the empire of the\r\nworld. One might say that here the two antagonistic forces exhausted\r\nthemselves, that they have equally lost their potency; so much so, that\r\nat the close of the combat all has sunk into the silence and immobility\r\nof death. And who knows if the volcanic crater, whose absence at first\r\nastonishes the observer, is not the Dead Sea itself? Is it unreasonable\r\nto admit that after the upheaval of the mountains which inclose it, and\r\nwhich a terrible explosion of subterranean fire will have separated, the\r\nneighbouring waters were precipitated into and swallowed up in the\r\nyawning gulf which they still fill to-day?... This hypothesis is so much\r\nthe more probable, because in this fire-scathed region the lake affords\r\nmanifest indications of an igneous travail even now accomplishing itself\r\nsullenly in the bowels of the globe. We know that its name of Lake\r\nAsphaltites is due to the semi-fluid bituminous matter which constantly\r\nrises to its surface and accumulates on its shores. With the vapours\r\nexhaled by this bitumen under the influence of heat, mingle sulphurous\r\nand ammoniacal exhalations, which render the atmosphere of the Dead Sea\r\ndangerous to breathe.\"[46]\r\n\r\nBefore 1835 no one had ventured upon its waters. An Irish traveller,\r\nnamed Cottingham, was their first navigator; but after a five days'\r\nvoyage he returned to Jerusalem, and died of exhaustion. Two years later\r\nMessrs. Moore and Beke made a new attempt. For several days they\r\nwithstood the pestilential exhalations of the lake, and succeeded in\r\nproving the deep depression of its basin; but at length, both of them\r\nbeing taken ill, they were compelled to cut short their explorations. In\r\n1847 the enterprise was undertaken by a Frenchman--Lieutenant\r\nMolyneux--who sounded it in many places, but was speedily carried off by\r\nfever. The following year Lieutenant Lynch, of the American navy,\r\nembarked on the lake in iron boats, with competent crews. He navigated\r\nits waters for three weeks; but all who composed the expedition were\r\nmore or less severely attacked, and one of them, Lieutenant Deane,\r\nsuccumbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEAD SEA.]\r\n\r\nThough, as we have said, geographical research has dissipated most of\r\nthe wild stories formerly accepted in reference to the peculiarly fatal\r\nconcomitants of the Dead Sea, it well deserves its expressive name. It\r\n_is_ a _dead_ sea: it has neither the ocean's living movement nor\r\ndeep-sounding roar; the surf and the spray never sparkle on its rocks;\r\nthat \"multitudinous laughter\" which Homer ascribes to the sea is wholly\r\nwanting; the wind never wakes a smile on its passive and sombre\r\ncountenance. By its shores one might realize Shelley's mournful wish,\r\nand feel\r\n\r\n                                \"In the warm air\r\n        His cheek grow cold, and hear the sea\r\n    Breathe o'er his dying brain its last monotony.\"[47]\r\n\r\nIt is lifeless, untenanted; the fish found there, and brought down by\r\nthe Jordan, are dead. Unlike the Caspian, it is never stirred by the\r\nwhirr of wings--by the flight of gulls, or pelicans, or sea-mews. The\r\nmigratory birds sweep across it without even a pause, without seeking\r\nthe prey which they could not find. Its waters are denser than those of\r\nother seas: their constituents are different, and mingled in different\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nLaorty-Hadji is mistaken in his idea that they repose on a bed of rock\r\nsalt. Rock salt is the chloride of sodium in a nearly pure condition.\r\nBut the Dead Sea holds in solution a comparatively small portion of this\r\nsalt, mixed with large proportions of other salts. Its water was\r\nanalyzed for the first time in 1778 by Lavoiser, Macquer, and Sage.\r\nExperiments have also been made by Arcet, Klaproth, Gmelin, Gay-Lussac,\r\nand, more recently, by Boussingault. According to the latter, it\r\ncontains:--\r\n\r\n  Chloride of magnesium,      10.7288\r\n  Chloride of sodium,          6.4964\r\n  Chloride of calcium,         3.5592\r\n  Chloride of potassium,       1.6110\r\n  Bromide of magnesium,        0.3306\r\n  Sulphate of lime,            0.0424\r\n  Sal-ammoniac,                 .0013\r\n  Water,                      77.2303\r\n                             --------\r\n                             100.0000\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that it possesses neither chloride of manganese nor\r\nchloride of aluminium, no nitrates, and no iodines; that it is,\r\ntherefore, not _sea water_, properly so called, but a mineral water _sui\r\ngeneris_.\r\n\r\nThe enormous proportion of saline matter accounts for its exceptional\r\ndensity, and justifies the assertion of travellers that a man floats\r\nupon its surface like a log of wood; though we can hardly credit the\r\nstatement of Pococke that it is impossible to sink to the bottom. Its\r\ngravity undoubtedly endows it with extraordinary buoyancy, and to dive\r\nto any considerable depth is a matter of difficulty; but in the Dead\r\nSea, as in other seas, man must employ his strength and skill to keep\r\nhis body afloat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nARABIA DESERTA AND ARABIA PETRÆA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traveller who starts from the southern extremity of the Dead Sea\r\nencounters a succession of deserts. To the east extend wide plains,\r\ncovered with ruins, where upwards of thirty cities are to be traced in\r\ntheir decay, like Palmyra, by the trunks of shattered columns and the\r\nwrecks of desecrated temples. This is the once flourishing country of\r\nthe Nabatheans, now haunted by some tribes of Idumean Arabs. One might\r\nnot inappropriately call it the vestibule of Arabia Deserta; a name\r\napplicable to all the central and southern districts--that is to say, to\r\nnearly three-fourths of the Arabian peninsula. There the sea of sand\r\nreveals itself in all its nakedness, in all its horrors; with its\r\nimplacable sky and fiery atmosphere, its sandy billows, its masses of\r\nsalt, and, in certain places, with its hidden quicksands capable of\r\ndevouring entire armies. The Desert of Akhaf, situated towards the\r\nextremity of the peninsula, conceals, it is said, several of these\r\nabysses, where the hapless traveller, if he set his foot upon them,\r\nwould be instantly swallowed up. Thus even the Arabs regard it with an\r\nunconquerable dread. It owes its name to a Saffite king who would fain\r\nhave traversed it with his troops, and who saw them perish therein even\r\nto the last man. The tradition does not inform us how he himself escaped\r\nthis immense disaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARAVAN IN THE DESERT.]\r\n\r\nA European traveller, Baron de Wrede, undertook nevertheless, some\r\ntwenty-five years ago, to penetrate into this soul-appalling desert, and\r\nattempted to measure the extent and depth of one of these abysses.\r\nStarting in the morning from Saba, under the guidance of a few Bedouins,\r\nhe reached, after six hours' marching, the threshold of the desert of\r\nAkhaf.\r\n\r\n\"A sandy plain, extending as far as the eye could reach,\" he says, \"and\r\nupon which arose innumerable hills in the semblance of waves,--such was\r\nthe scene presented to my gaze. Not the least trace of vegetation was\r\nperceptible; not a bird interrupted with its song the tomb-like silence\r\nwhich prevailed around the graves of the Sabean army. I remarked three\r\ntracts distinguished by a dazzling whiteness. 'Yonder are the abysses,'\r\nsaid the Bedouins; 'they are inhabited by the spirits who have covered\r\nwith this deceitful sand the treasures intrusted to their charge. He who\r\ndares approach them will assuredly be dragged down under the sand! Do\r\nnot venture there!'\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, I paid no attention to this counsel; on the contrary, I\r\ndemanded to be guided towards them, according to agreement. Two hours\r\nwere consumed by our camels in reaching the bottom of the plateau, where\r\nwe arrived at sunset, taking up our quarters for the night on the lee\r\nside of two enormous rocks. On the following day I insisted that the\r\nBedouins should guide me over these tracts. My trouble was in vain; fear\r\nrendered them unable to utter a word. Furnished with a plumb-lead\r\nweighing about a pound and a quarter, to which was attached a rope\r\nnearly 350 yards in length, I accomplished this dangerous enterprise. I\r\noccupied thirty-six minutes in reaching the first abyss; it was\r\nthirty-six feet long by twenty-six feet broad, and formed an inclined\r\nplain towards the centre, about six feet deep, which I attributed to the\r\naction of the wind. I approached at first with the utmost precaution, in\r\norder to examine the sand, and found it to be almost impalpable. I cast\r\nmy plumb-lead as far as I could; it disappeared immediately; however,\r\nthe rapidity with which the rope shortened gradually diminished; in five\r\nminutes, it had wholly disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nBaron de Wrede has made no attempt to account for this strange\r\nphenomenon, which is not, I may add, peculiar to Arabia. The late Doctor\r\nCloquet, who for many years acted as chief physician to the Shah of\r\nPersia, relates that he had seen similar gulfs in the great Salt Desert,\r\nwhich he considered to occupy the place of lakes suddenly vanished. This\r\nhypothesis is certainly admissible, and perhaps very probable; but while\r\nin some degree explaining the existence of these abysses of sand, it\r\nraises fresh questions which are by no means easily answered; for\r\ninstance, why have these lakes disappeared, and why have they been\r\nreplaced by this impalpable and incoherent dust in which heavy bodies\r\nsink as in a void?\r\n\r\nConsider, moreover, the remarks made by Doctor Cloquet in a letter\r\naddressed in 1851 to the Academy of Medicine at Paris:--\r\n\r\n\"At fifteen parasangs from Teheran,[48] commences the _Salt Desert_,\r\nwhich, from east to west, extends to the very frontiers of India. This\r\nimmense basin, eastward, has no other limits than the horizon; to the\r\nwest, to the north, to the south, it is bounded by hills of sand which\r\ncompletely represent the Dunes of France. The soil, of a fawn-coloured\r\nyellow, is composed of clay and sand, exactly resembling the mud which\r\noccupies the bottom of a dried-up basin. It is said that at many points\r\na man on horseback will disappear without his body being ever again\r\ndiscovered.[49] I have seen one of these places, near Sivas; the soil is\r\neverywhere impregnated with salt mingled with nitre, which crystallizes\r\non the surface. For the rest, if you dig two or three inches deep, you\r\nfind water, though very brackish in quality. The general opinion is that\r\nthe desert was once occupied by a sea, which suddenly disappeared on the\r\nnight that Mohammed was born. And it seems to me that there is no reason\r\nto doubt this sudden disappearance, since even in our own days, and only\r\na few years ago, the salt lake of Ourmiah (Urumiyeh), in the province of\r\nAzerbaïdjan, vanished completely for twenty-four hours; it is true that\r\nthe waters emerged again from their subterranean basin. I think it\r\nalmost absolutely demonstrated, from inspection of these localities,\r\nthat at a remote epoch this sea communicated with the Caspian, and\r\nformed one united basin of water. I am not sure but that in the south it\r\nalso communicated with the Indian Sea, for I have not travelled in that\r\ndirection. The apparition of the Elburz chain has cloven the two basins,\r\nand the sea, receiving only inconsiderable streams, insensibly receded,\r\nuntil the day when it was wholly dried up, leaving only two lakes: one,\r\nthe lake of Sivas, which disappeared in the seventh century; the other,\r\nthe lake of Seistan, which is still extant, and receives several of the\r\nimportant rivers of Afghanistan. At all events, the great sea itself had\r\ndisappeared some generations prior to the epoch of Alexander.\r\n\r\n\"The great humidity of the soil,\" adds Doctor Cloquet, \"struck me\r\nvividly. Does not this humidity appear to indicate the presence of vast\r\nsubterranean sheets of water, which sweat, so to speak (_transsuderaient_),\r\nthrough the porosities of the earth?\"\r\n\r\nThe desert table-land of Nadjed, which fills all the central part of\r\nAsia, is bounded on the west and south by the more fertile and fortunate\r\ncountries of the Hedjaz and the Hadramant, which skirt the Indian Ocean.\r\nTo the north-east lies the desert of the Tih, whose deep sand-drifts lie\r\nbetween Palestine and the Isthmus of Suez, and which the Mediterranean\r\nwashes on the north, on the south-west the Gulf of Suez, and on the\r\nsouth-east the Gulf of Akaba. This is the small triangular peninsula\r\nwhich was known to ancient geographers as Arabia the Stony. A group of\r\never-famous mountains, hallowed by the sublimest associations, Sinaï,\r\nHoreb, Jebel Mûsa, Jebel Bestîn (St. Epistème), raise their granitic\r\nsummits on the southern point of this peninsula. \"They are 'the Alps' of\r\nArabia; but the Alps planted in the desert, and therefore stripped of\r\nall the clothing which goes to make up our notions of Swiss or English\r\nmountains; stripped of the variegated drapery of oak, and birch, and\r\npine and fir, of moss, and grass, and fern; which to landscapes of\r\nEuropean hills are almost as essential as the rocks and peaks\r\nthemselves.\" Sinaï, or St. Catherine, the loftiest peak in the range,\r\nreaches an elevation of 8160 feet. It is so closely connected with Mount\r\nHoreb, to the north, that the two mountains really seem but one.\r\nRavines, and narrow valleys planted with palm-trees, thorny acacias,\r\ntamarisks, and some other shrubs, wind between the abrupt trunks of this\r\ngrand chain. In one of these valleys stands the Monastery of the\r\nTransfiguration, and on Mount Horeb rises the Church of St. Catherine, a\r\nshrine held in great esteem by devout Greeks. The pilgrims ascend on\r\ntheir knees a large staircase laboriously constructed by the monks.\r\n\r\nI have no space to recapitulate the sublime historic memories which\r\ninvest these solemn heights with an interest of their own. The presence\r\nof the Almighty has clothed their summits with a glory that might not be\r\nborne; the thunders of the Most High have echoed through their deep dark\r\nvalleys. At their base the people of Israel watched and waited while\r\nMoses received from Heaven the code which thenceforth determined their\r\nreligious and civil polity. Down the side of yonder mighty peak came\r\ntheir Prophet and Leader, his face bright with a radiance such as was\r\nnever before on the face of mortal man. They were the scene of a\r\nsingularly unique history; by which, as Dean Stanley remarks, \"the fate\r\nof the three surrounding nations--Egypt, Arabia, Palestine--and through\r\nthem the fate of the whole world, has been determined.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT SINAI.]\r\n\r\nThe locality, consecrated by such glorious associations, is also rich in\r\ngeological interest. It exhibits indubitable traces of the great\r\nvolcanic convulsions which have so profoundly shaken the shores of the\r\nDead Sea, and which still growl sullenly under the accumulated rocks. In\r\nthe time of Procopius, the legend runs that men fled from Sinaï on\r\naccount of the gruesome noises which haunted it; and modern travellers,\r\nnotably Stutzen and Gray, declare that they have heard at intervals a\r\nsound comparable to the dull heavy throbbing of a Cyclops' pulse. It\r\nmight be said that one of the vast arteries which provide for the\r\ncirculation of the ever boiling and seething flood of lava of our globe\r\npasses in this direction at an insignificant depth below the surface.\r\nThe springs of thermal waters which well out at the mountain-base, the\r\nmasses of bitumen and lava scattered over the soil, the gigantic rocks\r\nwhich bristle over the whole desert of El-Tîh, and whose hue, to adopt\r\nthe expression of a modern traveller, is that of calcined and\r\nfire-scathed matter, are sufficient evidence that this country has been\r\nthe theatre of dreadful volcanic phenomena.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Bida and Hachette describe a place named _Wâdy-Nassoub_,\r\nsituated a short distance from Sarabit-el-Kadim, on the road from Sinaï\r\nto Suez. It is gained after traversing Ramleh (\"the sandy\"), a sandy\r\nravine which serves as a retreat for horrible black serpents, both big\r\nand little, and for enormous lizards, and which is followed by a narrow\r\nvalley. \"Wâdy-Nassoub,\" according to these travellers, \"is one of the\r\nmost magnificent spectacles we have ever seen. It is a circus of twenty\r\nto twenty-five leagues in extent, surrounded by huge rocks arranged in\r\nsuccessive terraces, and of incomparable beauty of form and colour. Its\r\narena is an immense sheet of black basalt, furrowed here and there by\r\ntorrents of yellow sand. A dazzling sun kindles up this landscape, which\r\nis one of incredible splendour.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE BAUDOUIN (A SALT LAKE).]\r\n\r\nAs you approach the Isthmus of Suez--which will soon be annihilated, so\r\nto speak, by M. de Lesseps' great ship-canal--the desert resumes the\r\ncharacter which we have seen it bear in Persia and Central Arabia. The\r\nrocks, much rarer and less lofty, gradually give place to mountains of\r\nsand. Salt lakes and fields of salt re-appear. Near the shores of the\r\nMediterranean lies a pool of salt, still known by that name of Lake\r\nBaudouin (Baldwin), which the Crusaders imposed upon it. There the salt\r\nforms a firm and tenacious crust, on which the camel safely plants its\r\nfoot. Sometimes the iron hoof of a horse breaks through, but beneath\r\nthis first frail stratum it meets with another of astonishing hardness.\r\n\"You might think yourself,\" says a traveller, \"on the Mer de Glace of\r\nMont Blanc. Our camel-drivers collected some large pieces from the\r\nsurface. Nothing can be more brilliant or more transparent than these\r\ncrystals. It is by tasting them only that you can distinguish them from\r\nrock crystal. As we advance, the impression grows overpowering. A plain\r\nof dazzling whiteness surrounds us, and is prolonged far beyond our\r\nken. Dimly on the left may be perceived, like an indigo-coloured ribbon,\r\nthe line of the distant sea. The sky itself appears jet black. The\r\nreverberation of sound is unendurable.\" Still further, between Suez and\r\nCairo, the same traveller speaks admiringly of a natural amphitheatre,\r\nenclosed between two mountain-spurs, and strewn with _débris_ of rock,\r\nand especially with petrified wood. It might be compared to a\r\nforest-clearing which the woodmen had just quitted. The splinters are\r\nquite fresh, the cloven fragments still expose the notches made by the\r\naxe. Great trees, divided into beams, resemble long serpents which have\r\nbeen slain by blows from a hatchet. The division is so clear that each\r\ngash reveals the concentric tissues perfectly preserved by this mineral\r\nembalming, this natural silification. Similar petrifactions may be seen\r\nin abundance on the plateaux of the Makattam, and the amphitheatre now\r\ndescribed is not far from the hill, visited by every tourist, which has\r\nreceived the name of the Petrified Forest.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the Land Deserts, despite the proverbial monotony\r\nof their aspect, do not fail to offer to the artist as well as the\r\nsavant, the philosopher no less than the historian, objects worthy of\r\npatient study. Everywhere the handiwork of God and the evidences of\r\nAlmighty design awaken the admiration of the thoughtful. Whether the\r\npicture be sombre or beautiful, grand or appalling, we see that it was\r\nconceived and filled up by superhuman power. But we are now in Egypt, on\r\nthe threshold of the world's vast deserts. Egypt, kept alive by the\r\nfertilizing and genial Nile, is but an island in the great ocean of sand\r\nwhich encircles it, and which, far more truly than the Red Sea or the\r\nMediterranean, isolates it from the rest of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE NUBIAN DESERT--THE GREAT SAHARA--DESERTS OF AFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as we pass beyond the narrow borders of the Nile valley we\r\nencounter the Desert. Egypt _is_, in fact, the Nile; the Nile makes,\r\nrecreates, preserves, fecundates Egypt, which, without this grand and\r\never-famous river, would immediately cease to be.\r\n\r\n\"Everything in Egypt,\" says Miss Martineau,[50] with equal truth and\r\neloquence, \"life itself, and all that it includes, depends on the state\r\nof the unintermitting conflict between the Nile and the Desert. The\r\nworld has seen many straggles; but no other so pertinacious, so\r\nperdurable, and so sublime as the conflict of these two great powers.\r\nThe Nile, ever young, because perpetually renewing its youth, appears to\r\nthe inexperienced eye to have no chance, with its stripling force,\r\nagainst the great old Goliath, the Desert, whose might has never relaxed\r\nfrom the earliest days till now; but the giant has not conquered it. Now\r\nand then he has prevailed for a season, and the tremblers whose destiny\r\nhung on the event have cried out that all was over; but he has once more\r\nbeen driven back, and Nilus has risen up again to do what we see him\r\ndoing in the sculptures--bind up his water-plants about the throne of\r\nEgypt.\"\r\n\r\nThe traveller, ascending the famous river which has so long been mixed\r\nup with an apparently insoluble geographical problem, sees the Desert\r\neverywhere present; its yellow boundary-line is vividly traced against\r\nthe rich emerald-green of the fertile valley, and, as he advances, that\r\nline seems to draw nearer and nearer, until the cultivated soil appears\r\nreduced to a narrow strip on the river-bank. It has encroached upon many\r\nonce prosperous and busy sites, and buried deeply the memorials of the\r\nold Egyptian civilization.\r\n\r\n                \"Round the decay\r\n    Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,\r\n    The lone and level sands stretch far away.\"\r\n\r\nEverywhere outside the valley of the Nile, I repeat, lies the Desert.\r\nWest of the Arabian chain of heights stretch the vast sandy plains\r\nfrequented by the Arab tribes of the Beni-Wassel and the Arabdé. Beyond\r\nthe eastern chain spread the Libyan Deserts, which, in the remote\r\ndistance, merge into the Great Sahara, and those of the Thebaïd, where\r\nthe early Christian anchorites found a dismal asylum. Lower, to the\r\nsouth of Egypt, extend the Deserts of Lower Nubia.\r\n\r\nLet us ascend the Nile as far as Korosko, on the right bank of the\r\nriver, and cross the huge chain of rocky hills which separates the\r\ncultivated zone from the Desert to which the village just spoken of\r\ngives name. These hills, all of equal elevation, assume the form of\r\ntruncated cones. They are layers of granite superimposed horizontally,\r\nand with a depth of colour which makes them resemble at the first glance\r\nmasses of basalt. They are absolutely bare, and separated from each\r\nother by abrupt sinuous gorges, whose bottom is covered deep in sand of\r\ngolden lights, brought from the desert on the wings of the south-west.\r\nLong streams of the same brilliant sand descend the slopes opposed to\r\nthe direction of the wind with graceful undulations, which subside\r\nimperceptibly in the blown sand that carpets the floor of these\r\nmysterious valleys. The crests of the hills can only be distinguished by\r\ntheir different colours; some are lightly shaded with gray, others with\r\nblue or green, and others again with rose or crimson. The reflets of the\r\nsetting sun on these uniform and many-coloured summits have a marvellous\r\nsplendour, lighting up the scene until it assumes a fairy aspect,\r\n\r\n    \"And all puts on a gentle hue,\r\n     Hanging in the shadowy air,\r\n     Like a picture rich and rare.\"\r\n\r\nAt certain times it would rather remind the spectator of another of\r\nColeridge's conceptions:\r\n\r\n    \"A savage place! as holy and enchanted\r\n     As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted\r\n     By woman wailing for her demon-lover!\"[51]\r\n\r\nYet the spectacle is generally one of a rare and peculiar loveliness.\r\n\"If nature,\" says M. Trémaux,[52] \"had invested with this kind of beauty\r\nour verdurous fields of the West, they would have been veritable Edens;\r\nbut to produce, blend, and harmonize these inimitable hues, it requires,\r\nunder the last beams of the sun, the emanations from the heated sands\r\nand those which the day has called into existence from the burning\r\nsurfaces of the denuded rocks. It is by the side of her greatest horrors\r\nnature places her grandest beauties.\"\r\n\r\nThe horror of the Desert does not lie only in its aridity, in its\r\nvacuity--this vacuity is not absolute; in default of life, Death peoples\r\nits solitudes. The glens or gorges frequented by the caravans are lined\r\nwith stones, symmetrically disposed at certain intervals. These stones\r\nmark the places where rest the remains of the hapless pilgrims who have\r\nattempted to cross the wilderness, and perished in the attempt. Round\r\nand about each rugged tomb lie the skeletons of animals which none have\r\ntroubled themselves to bury in the sand. Frequently you may see, on the\r\nsandy wastes of Africa, or the desolate plains of Asia and the New\r\nWorld, these carcasses laid out in two interminable rows; indicating the\r\ngloomy track which should be followed by the traveller, and never\r\nfailing to remind him of the tribute Death levies upon mankind in these\r\naccursed regions. Thus does the Desert show itself more relentless than\r\neven the hungry ocean, which at least devours its victims whole, and\r\naffronts the eye with no traces of its murders. But the Moloch of the\r\nDesert has no shame; it cynically exposes the hideous remains of those\r\nwhom it has killed; it strews the earth with their bones; it has its\r\nmuseums of skeletons, or rather of preserved animals.\r\n\r\nM. Trémaux observed this curious phenomenon in the ravines of Korosko,\r\nbut it probably occurs elsewhere under similar conditions. On closely\r\nexamining the carcasses which he met at every step, he was astonished to\r\nfind them covered with their skin, and presenting still their natural\r\nforms, as if the animals had been stuffed or embalmed. He readily\r\ndistinguished horses, oxen, asses, camels. He observed with no less\r\nsurprise that these corpses exhaled no odour. They had been dried by the\r\nheat before decomposition could commence its frightful work. The skin\r\nhad hardened; the muscles and internal organs had been reduced into dust\r\nand gradually blown away by the wind through the yawning apertures at\r\nthe two extremities of the body. There remained nothing more, literally,\r\nbut skin and bone.\r\n\r\n\"This skin had such a consistency,\" says our author, \"such a degree of\r\nsolidity, that all my efforts to split it were without result. The\r\nheaviest stones which I could raise rebounded upon their carcasses with\r\na loud noise, but did not pierce them. If a man dies while a caravan is\r\non its march, he is buried in the sand. I have had no opportunity of\r\nexamining whether the desert-heat produces the same effect upon his body\r\nas upon the corpses of the animals just mentioned; but it ought not to\r\nbe so, since the human skin has not the same consistency.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn issuing from these gorges, we enter upon the Desert proper by a sandy\r\nplain which the Djellahs have named the \"River without Water,\" and\r\nwhich, very low at first, slowly rises into a plateau of very slight\r\nelevation, intersected by some veins of a sandstone similar to that of\r\nthe conical mountains. Then the plain declines anew, and we emerge upon\r\nthe Sea of Sand, where the pulverized sandstone alternates with fields\r\nof rotted or broken pebbles, and mounds of porphyry and granite. At the\r\nfoot of one of these mounds, the _Tallat-el-Guindé_, flourish a few\r\nwretched vegetables, among others some gum-trees and doum-palms. The\r\nlatter trees are also found in solitary mournfulness scattered about the\r\nplain. Otherwise the _Desert of Korosko_ is wholly deprived of vegetable\r\nlife, of\r\n\r\n    \"The glory in the grass, and the splendour in the flower.\"\r\n\r\nAs for water, it must needs be content with that of a few brackish\r\nwells, grouped, about twelve in number, at a spot called _El-Mourath_.\r\nIt is there only that the caravans can fill their ill-tanned\r\nleather-bottles, in which the already nauseating liquid grows hot, and\r\nquickly becomes putrid. Its stench and its taste are then so disgustful\r\nthat the very camels reject it several times before they can constrain\r\nthemselves to drink of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAVINES OF KOROSKO.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Desert of Bahiouda_, situated in about the same latitude as that of\r\nKorosko, but on the other bank of the Nile, is of a less absolute\r\naridity and nakedness. Water is more abundant and less brackish;\r\nvegetation is less scanty; and one meets on every side with giraffes,\r\ngazelles, wild cattle, and even, it is said, with lions and elephants.\r\nGreat numbers of reptiles, lizards, serpents, and tortoises inhabit the\r\nsand and the crevices of the rocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSouth of the above-named Deserts, towards 17° N. lat., is placed the\r\nlimit of the Rainless District. Under the 18th parallel the rains do not\r\nlast above one or two months in the year, and in some years are\r\nabsolutely wanting; but when they _do_ fall, it is generally in\r\nimpetuous torrents. As we advance towards the Equator they become more\r\nregular, and last for longer periods. According to Humboldt, the average\r\nyearly rainfall in 19° N. lat. measures 80 inches; under the equator, 96\r\ninches. In these tropical climes the year is divided into two\r\nseasons--one of excessive drought, and one of excessive rain. During the\r\nformer, the sky is ever cloudless; during the latter, completely\r\novercast.\r\n\r\nThere are, in fact, two rainless belts or districts, one on each side of\r\nthe Equator. In the old world, the northern belt commences on the west\r\nside of Africa; includes the Sahara between 16° and 28° of latitude; and\r\nnarrowing as it extends easterly, comprises on the banks of the Nile\r\nfrom 19° to 27°. It also embraces the low coast; and portions of the\r\ninterior of Arabia; passes through Beloochistan to the base of the\r\nHimalayas, and terminates with the rainless tableland of Thibet. The\r\nsouthern district occurs north of the Gareep or Orange River in South\r\nAfrica, and includes wide tracts in Australia, and a narrow belt in\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nWhere the earth is blessed with copious showers, vegetation will abound;\r\ngrass, and herb, flower, bush, and tree;\r\n\r\n            \"Fields of grain\r\n      Will bend their tops\r\n    To the numberless beating drops.\"\r\n\r\nTo meet with the true Desert we must, therefore, direct our steps in a\r\nnorth-westerly course, and penetrate into _The Sahara_.\r\n\r\nM. Charles Martins, in his elaborate monograph on this remarkable\r\nregion, divides it into three distinct sub-regions: the _Desert of the\r\nTable-lands_, the _Desert of Erosion_, and the _Sandy Desert_.[53]\r\n\r\nIn Algeria, and in Barbary generally, the Mediterranean littoral does\r\nnot come into immediate contact with the Sahara; but is separated from\r\nit by the Atlas chain. But the Atlas does not rise abruptly from the\r\nplain: on either side it ascends by a succession of rocky steps or\r\nterraces, which form the sub-region of the elevated Table-lands. Vast\r\ndenuded surfaces, sprinkled with _chotts_, or salt lakes, deprived of\r\nall arborescent vegetation, traversed in summer by immense herds which\r\nfeed on the plants even to their very roots, bare mountains starting\r\nabruptly from these horizontal surfaces; such is the general aspect of\r\nthe landscape. The richly-varied culture of the Mediterranean littoral\r\nhas disappeared, and barley is the only cereal which the husbandman\r\nrelies upon for his harvest. At many points, however, the \"purple vine\"\r\nand \"golden olive\" succeed admirably, and are destined one day to clothe\r\nthe nakedness of these plateaux which the free-pasturing herds and the\r\ncareless Arab have stripped of their blooming verdure.\r\n\r\nDescending these rocky terraces of gray old Atlas, we enter the desert\r\nregion in its first phase: the Desert of the Table-lands, or Saharan\r\nSteppe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LANDSCAPE IN THE ATLAS (REGION OF TABLE-LANDS).]\r\n\r\nHere, horizontal strata of mud and gypsum, or sulphate of lime, are\r\ndeposited upon the shores, as it were, of the great Sandy Sea. The\r\ngypsum reposing on the mud is composed of plates in such close\r\njuxtaposition as to resemble an artificial pavement. \"It covers the\r\nsurface of vast plateaux which have not been encroached upon by the\r\nwaters; whether those waters were marine currents at the epoch when the\r\nSahara was a vast sea, or diluvian torrents which descended from the\r\nmountains after their elevation, little matters; the gypsum, produced by\r\nthe violent evaporation of the Saharan sea, has withstood their\r\noperation, and composes the plateaux of which we are speaking. Their\r\nsurface is so smooth, that vehicles might roll for leagues upon this\r\nnatural pavement, which echoes like a vault under the horses' hoofs.\r\nA plateau of this kind, the small Desert of Mourad, extends from Biskra\r\nto the banks of the great salt lake called _Chott Mebrir_ by the Arabs.\r\nThe gypseous surface is not everywhere exposed: most frequently it is\r\ncovered by a layer of small rounded pebbles, nearly all quartzose,\r\nexhibiting the greatest variety of tints, from the purest white to the\r\nmost vivid red; they are mixed with black calcareous stones split on the\r\nsurface. Whence came these pebbles, which have evidently been 'rolled'\r\nby the waters? We know not. They are the mysterious witnesses of those\r\ngrand diluvian torrents which have left the traces of their passage over\r\nthe surface of the whole earth, though the geologist cannot always\r\ndiscover the mountains or rocks that furnished the materials of this\r\ndiluvium.\"[54]\r\n\r\nFrom the Desert of the Table-lands we must needs make another descent.\r\nThe town of Batna is situated at the extremity of the lowest of the\r\nAtlantean terraces, whose elevation is still some 3300 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea. To the north-west rise the lofty spires of the\r\ncolossal chain, with their diadems of cedars sharply defined in black\r\nupon the azure of the sky. Loftiest of all soars the _Jebel-Tougour_, or\r\n\"Peak of Cedars,\" reminding the spectator of the Pyrenean crests.\r\nTowards the south-east stretch the rounded shoulders of the mountains of\r\nthe Aurès, clad with dense dark forest of oak and pine. In a fold of the\r\nmountains lurk the ancient Lambessa and the mouldering ruins of a Roman\r\ncamp. Four miles to the south of Batna is a large depressed hill, whose\r\nbase mingles with the table-land, above which it rises only three\r\nhundred and thirty feet. This ridge marks the watershed; all the streams\r\non the north flowing towards the Mediterranean, and, on the south,\r\ngradually disappearing in the arid bed of the ancient Saharan sea. On\r\nthe frontier line, like a Cyclopean landmark, is planted the Peak of\r\nCedars, while from its loins a torrent issues, and through a deep ravine\r\nwhirls and leaps and flows towards the desert. Springs, abundant and\r\nwarm, bubble up through the chalky marls, and take the same direction.\r\nBeyond the French military post, called _Les Tamarins_, the road\r\ndescends the ravine-cloven mountain-slopes, and passes over the torrent\r\nwhich bifurcates at the foot of the majestic Metlili. On the left is\r\nseen a steep wall of rock, the Jebel-Gaouss, cleft midway by a chasm, or\r\nbreach, which the Arabs expressively designate \"The Mouth of the\r\nDesert,\" and which, gradually enlarging, opens upon the first oasis of\r\nthe Sahara, _El Kantara_ (\"the bridge,\" from a Roman arch which spans\r\nthe torrent), the most northerly limit of the palm-tree. \"A magnificent,\r\nsemi-alpine, semi-tropical scene. Below, a tumultuous foaming stream,\r\nits banks on either side clad with palms bending their feathery foliage\r\ntowards the river, and sheltering fig, apricot, peach, almond, and\r\npomegranate trees.\"[55] Above, a range of snowy heights, wreathed in\r\never ascending and descending clouds.\r\n\r\nWe now enter the Desert of Erosion, a mass of mountainous highlands; of\r\nridges, peaks, and _cols_, intersected and, as it were, gashed by\r\nravines where roll the winter torrents and the rivers which the heats of\r\nsummer dry up, and which, hollowing and gnawing into the stony soil,\r\nspread themselves over the valleys and awake a transitory vegetation.\r\nThe erosive action of the waters is, then, the special characteristic of\r\nthis part of the desert, which the Arabs call _Kifar_, or \"the abandoned\r\ncountry.\" Most of the streams which water it have their sources in\r\nMounts Aurès and Zibans, which form its northern boundary. They have\r\nexcavated wide intermingling furrows, whose intervening spaces are\r\noccupied by gypseous plateaux. The formations of less resisting power,\r\nthe marls, clays, and sands, have been washed away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SAHARA (DESERT OF EROSION).]\r\n\r\nThe waters, whether proceeding from rain, or the melting of the snows on\r\nthe loftiest peaks, are very pure at first, and roll in deep beds with\r\nvertical sides; when they reach the plains, their channels grow wider\r\nand shallower. In the wet season, the floods burst the banks, and\r\noverflowing, carry down immense quantities of rolled pebbles, which are\r\ndistributed over an extensive area; in ordinary weather they are reduced\r\nto thin threads of silver, which, on arriving in the desert, vanish\r\ncompletely. You must excavate the soil to obtain a supply of water, and\r\nwhen found, it is brackish. Frequently the beds unite, forming basins of\r\ngreater or less extent and depth, which fill themselves at the close of\r\nthe winter floods, and a few of which preserve, even in the winter\r\nseason, a certain quantity of water. Elsewhere, the soil is only humid,\r\nthanks to the abundance of salt, which retains the moisture. In such\r\nplaces numerous slimy marshes occur, where the traveller may not\r\nadventure without peril. But in general the surface is dry, cracked,\r\ncloven, and completely parched.\r\n\r\nThe Desert of Erosion is not completely inhabited. At intervals you meet\r\nwith a few squalid villages, and a multitude of camel's-skin tents are\r\nscattered like black spots over the yellow or grayish plains, on the\r\nborders of the _chotts_ or scanty water-courses. Herds of goats and\r\nflocks of sheep wander in the valleys, browsing on the rare short grass.\r\nColumns of smoke arise from the Arab bivouacs, and the women of the\r\nSahara group themselves around the wells and springs to fill the\r\nwater-bags with which they load their asses.\r\n\r\nWhen, from the summit of the rocks which fence round and bristle over\r\nthe Desert of Erosion, we perceive for the first time the _Desert of\r\nSand_, the impression is very similar to that which we derive from the\r\nsight of ocean. M. Martins had already become sensible of this peculiar\r\neffect when, from the Col de Sfa, he had gazed down upon the Desert of\r\nthe Plateaux. \"A grand circular arch,\" he says, \"extended before us,\r\nbounding a violet surface, smooth as the sea, and blending at the\r\nhorizon with the azure of heaven; it was the Sahara. The arc eastward\r\nrested against the chain of the Aurès; westward, against that of the\r\nZibans, some of whose offshoots, in the neighbourhood of Biskra, arose\r\nlike reefs upon that sea which seemed to have been frozen suddenly into\r\nimmobility. The actual sea ever trembles and shivers on the surface; a\r\nlight wavering, imperceptible to the eye, propels towards the shore the\r\nexpiring wave, fringed with a border of foam. Here, nothing like this\r\nmay be seen; it is a motionless, a congealed sea, or, rather, it is the\r\nsmooth bed of a sea whose waters have disappeared. Science teaches us\r\nthat such is the fact; and now as ever the expression of the reality is\r\nmore picturesque, more eloquent than all the comparisons created by the\r\nimagination.\"[56]\r\n\r\nAn eminent French artist, M. Fromentin, whose skill with the pen equals\r\nhis talent with the brush, has also painted this \"congealed sea\" in\r\ngrand and poetic language. \"The first impression,\" he says, \"produced by\r\nthis glowing lifeless picture, composed of the sun, space, and solitude,\r\nis keen, and cannot be compared to any other. Little by little, however,\r\nthe eye grows accustomed to the grandeur of the lines, to the emptiness\r\nof space, to the denudation of the earth; and if anything can still\r\nastonish, it is that one becomes sensible to effects which change so\r\nlittle, and is so powerfully affected by spectacles in reality of the\r\nsimplest character.\"[58]\r\n\r\nI must also enumerate among the \"artists in words\" who have painted the\r\nwonders of the Sahara, General Daumas, not one of the least\r\ndistinguished of the Franco-Algerine warriors. He describes it in the\r\nfollowing language:--\"It is a naked and barren immensity,--this sea of\r\nsand, whose eternal waves, agitated to-day by the _choub_, will\r\nto-morrow be heaped up immovable, and which are slowly furrowed by those\r\nfleets called caravans.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Daumas, it is evident, confines himself to the scientific\r\nrealism, which M. Martins prefers to the glowing and inexact imagery of\r\nthe poets, and conveys in a few words an accurate yet very picturesque\r\nidea of that arid sea, where the wind stirs up rolling waves of sand\r\ninstead of foaming billows, and which the Arabs call _Falat_. I shall\r\nplace before the reader, however, the description given by M. Martins\r\nhimself, for it represents both the _ensemble_ and the details of the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\"If the Desert of the Plateaux,\" he says,[57] \"be the image of a sea\r\nsuddenly fixed during a level calm, the Desert of Sand represents to us\r\na sea which may have been solidified during a violent tempest. The\r\nDunes, or sand-hills, like waves, rise one behind another even to the\r\nlimits of the horizon, separated by narrow valleys which represent the\r\ndepressions of the great billows of the ocean, all whose various aspects\r\nthey simulate. Sometimes they narrow themselves into keen-edged crests,\r\nor shoot upwards in pyramids, or swell into cylindrical domes. Seen from\r\na distance, these Dunes also remind us at times of the appearances of\r\nthe _névé_ (or granulated snow) in the amphitheatres and on the ridges\r\nwhich lie contiguous to the loftiest Alpine summits. Their colours still\r\nfurther enhance the illusion. Moulded by the winds, the burning sands of\r\nthe desert assume the same forms as the _névés_ of the glaciers.\"\r\n\r\nWhoever has seen the Dunes on the coast of Norfolk, or more particularly\r\nin Gascony, may gain a very accurate conception of the Desert. The only\r\nnotable differences are in the extent, which here seems infinite, like\r\nthat of ocean; the purity of the heaven, which is seldom sullied by a\r\ncloud; and the colour, which is of a soft, intense blue. The nature of\r\nthe soil is the same; it is a very fine, shifting, silicious sand, white\r\nsometimes, like that of Fontainebleau, and sometimes reddened by the\r\npresence of oxide of iron. In the Sahara this sand gathers in veritable\r\nDunes, hillocks which the wind upheaves, displaces, and transforms from\r\none day to another. Only the _lettes_, or valleys, which in our Dunes\r\nreceive the pluvial waters and preserve a sufficient amount of\r\nfertility, are here just moistened by rare saline infiltrations, and\r\nalmost always remain in a condition of absolute sterility. Nevertheless,\r\nin some localities, the presence of gypsum gives the sand a certain\r\nfixity, which permits a small number of plants to germinate and develop\r\nthemselves. This gypsum is never found but in the valleys, and never in\r\ntabular masses, as on the plateaux, but only in crystals of various\r\nforms, penetrated by silica. \"You pick up a pebble,\" says M. Martins,\r\n\"and find it to be a crystal.\" The villages are surrounded by\r\ncrenellated ramparts built of crystals; the houses which compose these\r\nvillages are constructed of the same materials; and very weird and\r\nsplendid is the scene presented by these edifices with their\r\nsun-illuminated walls. Notwithstanding their small dimensions and mean\r\narchitecture, when thus lit up in glorious radiance, they seem to\r\nrealize the wonders told in fairy tales of the enchanted palaces of the\r\ngenii!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPHENOMENA OF THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe desert has its own meteorology; it is the theatre of peculiar\r\nphenomena, which one observes in no other part of the globe. Its\r\nclimate, at least in the sandy region, is remarkably uniform; it varies\r\nonly, according to latitude, in a greater or less elevated\r\nthermometrical mean. Hippocrates, the ancient philosopher, rightly\r\ncalled \"the Father of Medicine,\" states the three elements of climate to\r\nbe, the atmosphere, the soil, and the waters. Throughout the desert\r\nthese are identically similar, and consequently originate identically\r\nsimilar phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, in fact, is everywhere of an almost unchanging purity.\r\nIt is only in the neighbourhood of mountains that clouds accumulate, to\r\nspend themselves at periodical seasons in more or less abundant rains.\r\nIn the plains it never rains, and during the day no veil is interposed\r\nbetween the earth and the sun's burning glare, nor during the night do\r\nany refreshing dews weaken the force of the terrestrial radiation. There\r\nresult constant alternations of devouring heat while the sun is above\r\nthe horizon, and of rapid and frequently intense cooling when he has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe soil is everywhere as smooth as \"the liquid main.\" This uniformity\r\ncontributes, in addition to its silicious, argillaceous, or calcareous\r\ncharacter, to render more abrupt the changes of temperature which occur\r\nfrom morning to evening and from evening to morning. In truth, the earth\r\nreflects the sun's heat in proportion as it receives it; it absorbs but\r\ninsignificant quantities, which it loses in a few minutes when the\r\ncalorific source begins to fail. On the other hand, in these immense\r\nplains where no inequality of surface can oppose the atmospheric\r\nmovements, the wind acquires an increasing force and swiftness, _vires\r\nacquirit eundo_, and soon assumes all the characteristics of a tempest.\r\nHence arise those terrible typhoons, those appalling hurricanes, of\r\nwhose destructive effects history records so many instances, and of\r\nwhich I shall presently be called upon to speak. As for water, we have\r\nseen that its entire absence is a characteristic feature of the Sandy\r\nDesert.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, an overpowering degree of heat during the day,--a freshness,\r\noften even an excessive cold, during the night (in the Sahara the\r\nthermometer frequently rises above 120° F. at noon, and not infrequently\r\nsinks below 32° about two or three o'clock A.M.); an ever transparent\r\nand azure sky,\r\n\r\n    \"Darkly, deeply, beautifully blue;\"\r\n\r\nthe absence of rains and dews, of gales and thunder; but a frequent\r\nrecurrence of terrible hurricanes: such is the meteorological\r\nconstitution of the arid zone, which embraces all the northern districts\r\nof Africa, except the Mediterranean region--that is, from the snowy\r\nheights of Atlas to the fertile pastures of Soudan--and which extends in\r\nAsia from the west to the north-east, for all but one narrow belt, as\r\nfar as the 119th meridian of longitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nForemost among the phenomena peculiar to this zone we must place those\r\nfamous tempests which, in default of humid clouds, traverse with\r\nstartling swiftness the changing surface of the Desert, driving before\r\nthem whirlwinds of burning sand, and striking the traveller's heart with\r\na sense of unconquerable awe. The wind of the Desert is called by the\r\nArabs the _choum_ or _khamsin_; but is more generally known in European\r\nbooks as the _Simoun_, _Simoom_, or _Samoun_. It is the _Samiel_ of the\r\nTurks; and, under a somewhat milder form, the _Scirocco_ of the\r\nMediterranean. Wherever, or however it blows, it is a pernicious and\r\nhateful wind; the blast, in all probability, which destroyed the hosts\r\nof Sennacherib at the bidding of the Divine Word,--\r\n\r\n    \"The angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,\r\n     And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed.\r\n     And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,\r\n     And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still.\"\r\n\r\nTorrents of burning sand sweep before it, a thick veil of darkness\r\nenvelopes the firmament, and the sun assumes a blood-red hue.\r\n\r\n                        \"That crimson haze\r\n    By which the prostrate caravan is awed\r\n    In the red desert when the wind's abroad.\"[58]\r\n\r\nWhen the Simoom rises, says M. Martins,[59] the air is filled with dust\r\nof such extreme fineness that it makes its way through objects\r\nhermetically sealed, penetrates into the eyes, the ears, and the organs\r\nof respiration. A burning heat, like that which breathes from the mouth\r\nof a furnace, possesses the air, and paralyzes the strength of men and\r\nanimals. Seated on the sand, with their backs turned to windward, the\r\nArabs, wrapped in their burnous, wait with fatalistic resignation the\r\nend of the torment; their camels crouching, exhausted, panting, stretch\r\ntheir long necks upon the scorching soil. Seen through this powdery\r\nhaze, the sun's disc, shorn of its beams, shows pale and ghastly as that\r\nof the moon.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the phenomenon never prevails over any very considerable\r\narea, and beyond its limits the atmosphere remains serene and calm; so\r\nthat travellers who have watched it approaching in the form of a reddish\r\ncloud, without being able to calculate on its direction, have often\r\nescaped with no worse result than a panic, and have only witnessed its\r\nterrible effects at a distance.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be confounded with the sand-storms which the\r\npilgrim encounters in the Arabian Desert, and which seem confined to\r\nthat region. Dean Stanley, on his route from Suez to Sinai, met with one\r\nwhich prevailed the whole day. \"Imagine,\" he says, \"the caravan toiling\r\nagainst this,--the Bedouins each with his shawl thrown completely over\r\nhis head, half of the riders sitting backwards,--the camels, meantime\r\nthus virtually left without guidance, though from time to time throwing\r\ntheir long necks sideways to avoid the blast, yet moving straight\r\nonwards with a painful sense of duty truly edifying to behold. Through\r\nthe tempest, this roaring and driving tempest, which sometimes made me\r\nthink that this must be the real meaning of 'a _howling_ wilderness,' we\r\nrode on the whole day.\"[60]\r\n\r\nA French cavalier, M. Trémaux, while crossing the Desert of Korosko, had\r\nthe good fortune to witness the course of a Simoom, while himself in a\r\nposition of safety.\r\n\r\nIt was the 8th of February 1848. The horizon in the south-west wore a\r\nhue of the evillest augury. Gusts of wind, which seemed to have issued\r\nfrom some red-hot brazier, beat in the face of the travellers. The\r\ncamel-drivers, accustomed to interpret these sinister signs, and assured\r\nthat a tempest was at hand, felt themselves called upon to give M.\r\nTrémaux a few counsels, which were by no means reassuring.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the storm darkens the air,\" said one of them, \"by\r\nsurrounding us with a cloud of sand, we must throw ourselves prone on\r\nthe ground, wrap our heads in our finest stuffs, to protect our\r\nrespiration from this sand, which burns the throat. It will be useless\r\nto trouble ourselves about the camels; they will lie down of their own\r\naccord, bend their head against their burden, and never stir so long as\r\nthe tempest lasts. If the sand accumulates by our side, we must move in\r\nsuch a manner as to prevent it from covering us, making it roll under\r\nitself, but without exposing our heads. Remember these things carefully;\r\nand the will of God be done!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not all,\" added another; \"when the water-bags are partly\r\nshrunken, as are ours at this moment, and the Khamsin blows for some\r\ntime, it finishes by completely drying them up.\"\r\n\r\nThus warned, M. Trémaux was compelled to face, with all the resignation\r\nhe was capable of, the melancholy alternative of perishing suffocated by\r\nthe sand, or, a little later, of succumbing to the tortures of thirst.\r\nHe continued to journey, or rather to drag himself towards the centre of\r\nthe choking atmosphere, and to watch the scourge which rapidly drew\r\nnear. This lasted a couple of hours, after which the travellers had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the Simoom glide by on their right, and depart\r\nwith the same rapidity.\r\n\r\nA column of the French army, commanded by the Dukes of Aumale and of\r\nMontpensier, had met with a less happy chance on the 7th of March 1844,\r\nin the Souf, or Algerine Sahara; it was attacked by a Simoom, which\r\nprolonged its furious assaults during fourteen hours. On the day\r\nfollowing, M. Fournel, a mining engineer who accompanied the expedition,\r\nascertained that the meteor had swept but a narrow zone parallel to the\r\nAurès range, and that at the mountain base the tranquillity of the\r\natmosphere had been undisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe Simoom, or Khamsin, is, however, more troublesome and painful than\r\nreally dangerous. M. Martins speaks of the annihilated army of Cambyses,\r\nthe Persian king, which perished in the Libyan Desert (B.C. 524),[61]\r\nand of whole caravans engulfed in the sepulchral sands. \"The numerous\r\nskeletons of camels,\" he adds, \"which we met with on our way prove that\r\nthese catastrophes are still of frequent occurrence.\" It is more\r\nprobable, however, that they died from dearth of water and want of food.\r\nAs for the Persian host, it was probably swallowed up in one of those\r\nquicksands, those hidden treacherous gulfs, which are found in the\r\ndeserts of Libya, as well as in those of Persia and Arabia. The evil\r\neffects of the Simoom have, in fact, been exaggerated by the Arabs,\r\nwhose highly-coloured narratives have been too easily adopted by\r\ncredulous travellers. It heats the blood, it dries the skin, it\r\nrenders respiration troublesome; but it does not kill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FRENCH COLUMN IN ALGIERS SURPRISED BY THE SIMOOM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHIRLWINDS OF SAND (SAND-SPOUTS).]\r\n\r\nIt is not always a single wind which blows in the Deserts; but sometimes\r\ntwo or three currents, from opposite directions, cross and clash and\r\ndrive against one another with increasing fury. Then is produced the\r\nsingular phenomenon of the sand-spout, often witnessed on a magnificent\r\nscale in the sandy plains of Eastern Asia and Southern America. The sand\r\nis not now driven in voluminous masses in a rectilineal direction; but\r\nraised aloft in the form of long tortuous columns, which whirl to and\r\nfro like gigantic spectres in the mazes of a wild demon-dance. At the\r\nsame time, the azure of the sky grows pale and troubled, the sun's\r\nlight obscured, the boundaries of the horizon seem to meet together; the\r\nburning dust held in suspension in the air renders it irrespirable, and\r\nif one of these whirlwinds encounters any object which offers a\r\nresistance, it carries it upward and hurls it a considerable distance.\r\nFortunately the phenomenon is one of brief duration. The atmospheric\r\nequilibrium is speedily restored; the heavens recover their serenity;\r\nthe atmosphere grows clear, and the sand columns, falling in upon\r\nthemselves, form a number of little hills or cones, apparently\r\nconstructed with great care, like those mimic edifices of sand or snow\r\nbuilt up by children in their pastimes.\r\n\r\nIt is said that these furious whirlwinds have occasionally engulfed\r\nwhole caravans in their tremendous vortex,--\r\n\r\n    \"Man mounts on man, on camels camels rush,\r\n     Hosts march on hosts, and nations nations crush;\r\n     Wheeling in air the wingèd islands fall,\r\n     And one great sandy ocean covers all.\"\r\n\r\nWhether this be true or not, there can be no doubt that the spectacle is\r\none of great magnificence, and calculated to inspire the traveller with\r\nemotions of awe and dread. Mr. Atkinson describes it as seen by him, on\r\none occasion, when traversing the Mongolian Desert:--\r\n\r\n\"As we passed,\" he says,[62] \"in the middle of a space sown with\r\ninnumerable hillocks of sands, we saw about thirty of them suddenly\r\nraise themselves around us, lengthen into long elliptical columns, and\r\nglide with many a whirl and sweep over the surface of the Desert with\r\nthe hissings and contortions of gigantic serpents which had awakened at\r\nour approach. These spouts, for the phenomenon was no other, varied in\r\ndiameter; the smallest measured between twenty and thirty feet; a few\r\nattained to a hundred; and one, which absorbed in its vortex all that it\r\napproached, rose to nearly two hundred. One might have said, on seeing\r\nthem bending, rising again and crossing one another in space amidst an\r\natmosphere of dust, that they were antediluvian monsters emerging from\r\ntheir geological bed, and returning into the feverish activity of\r\nexistence. But soon, the atmospheric forces which had raised them\r\nbeginning to fail, we saw these sand-spouts fall away one after another,\r\nand form on the surface of the Desert a number of moving hillocks\r\nsimilar to those from which we had just emerged.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe poet, invoking the judgment of Heaven on the traitor, would fain\r\ndoom him to the misery of cherishing hopes that shall never be realized.\r\n\"May he,\" cries the minstrel--\r\n\r\n    \"May he, at last, with lips of flame,\r\n     On the parched desert thirsting die,\r\n     While lakes that shone in mockery nigh\r\n     Are fading oft, untouched, untasted.\"[63]\r\n\r\nThe image here is borrowed from that most singular phenomenon of the\r\nDesert, the _Mirage_; an atmospheric illusion due to the refraction of\r\nthe sun's rays upon the sand, and the intense expansion of the lower\r\nstrata of the air,--in other words, it arises from the total reflection\r\nof the rays of light from the lower surface of a stratum of air. \"This\r\noccurs when, from any cause, such a stratum of air possesses a higher\r\nrefractive power than the one immediately below it. Such a condition of\r\nthe atmosphere causes remote objects to be seen as if reflected in a\r\nmirror, or to appear as if suspended in the air. When the effect is\r\nconfined to apparent elevation, the English sailors call it _looming_;\r\nwhen inverted images are formed, the Italians give it the name of _Fata\r\nMorgana_. The Arabs call it _Serab_, or _Suhrab_, the 'Water of the\r\nDesert;' and the Hindus, _Tchittram_, or 'the Picture.'\"\r\n\r\nThe effects of the illusion are extraordinary, but undoubtedly they are\r\nheightened by the imagination of observers, generally over-excited by\r\nfatigue, by privations, or sometimes by fever. These causes contribute\r\nto vary the nature of the phenomenon as seen by different eyes. Thus\r\nsome gaze enraptured on verdurous islands bright as Armida's enchanted\r\ngarden, with feathery palms and blooming flowers, and delicious\r\nsparkling lakes; others see, in that dim far-off which is never reached,\r\nthe laughing waves of ocean, with ships resting calmly at anchor, or\r\n\r\n    \"Veering up and down, they know not why,\"\r\n\r\nand camels browsing quietly upon its shores; others, again, see before\r\nthem the rolling river, its banks studded with groves and palaces; and\r\nall this, while there is not a solitary real object on the horizon whose\r\npresence might serve in some degree as a foundation for their visions.\r\nIt is the very phantasmagoria of nature; her wildest, most wayward, and\r\nmost fantastic sport. The reflection of the sky, modified by the\r\ninequalities of the soil and the vibratory movements of the air, can\r\nalone account for the singular deception. Imagination shows its victim,\r\nin the reflected image of the cloudless sky, a sheet of water, which is\r\nvariously taken for a sea, a lake, or a river; it invests the slightest\r\nobjects on the earth's surface with forms, colours, and dimensions,\r\nwhich are easily metamorphosed into houses, ships, men, animals; and it\r\nseems certain that those which in Nubia our fancy converts into camels\r\nwould, in the Soudan, be transformed into elephants, and at Venice into\r\ngondolas. Imagination makes us its dupes, and gives to airy nothings\r\n\r\n    \"A local habitation and a name.\"\r\n\r\nIt becomes absolutely necessary, therefore, to distinguish these wholly\r\npersonal illusions born of a heated brain, from those which are really\r\ndue to a definite physical cause. The latter necessarily suppose the\r\nexistence of _actual objects_, below or very little above the horizon.\r\nUnder such conditions, the most frequent illusion is that which shows\r\nthe sky or rocks reflected in the expanse of rarified air superincumbent\r\non the earth's surface, and which through this cause alone resembles\r\nwater. It is then that the ignorant or inexperienced traveller,\r\noverwhelmed with fatigue and devoured by thirst, hastens his eager steps\r\nto reach more quickly that limpid water, where he hopes to refresh and\r\nreinvigorate himself, but which flies before his advance, and speedily\r\nvanishes altogether. Sometimes it is an inverted representation of\r\nterrestrial objects which appears in the air; or rather, these same\r\nobjects, several times reflected, appear to multiply themselves. M.\r\nTrémaux relates that he saw the latter form of mirage in Nubia. He\r\nobserved a row of doum-palms, which were about two thousand yards\r\ndistant, repeated in several similar rows, each with a like number of\r\ntrees, so as to produce the effect of a quincunx; among these trees\r\nfloated several seeming sheets of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MIRAGE IN THE DESERT.]\r\n\r\nWe must remember, moreover, that the immensity, uniformity, and vacuity\r\nof the Desert, singularly contribute to render optical illusions\r\nfrequent. The very serenity of the air assists in destroying the\r\nperspective to which we are accustomed in temperate climates, which are\r\nalways more or less misty. Objects appear much nearer than they are in\r\nreality, because they are more distinctly visible, and also because\r\nnothing intervenes between them and the observer. Their dimensions, too,\r\nbecome arbitrary, for want of standards of comparison by which to\r\nmeasure them. So the trees and the mountains where the weary traveller\r\nhopes to obtain a temporary repose and a passing shelter from the\r\nPythian's fiery arrows, seem constantly to recede before him, like the\r\nrainbow when pursued by the ignorant peasant; and, until experience has\r\ntaught him to rectify the apparent testimony of his senses, he is\r\ndoomed, like Tantalus, to be the victim of continual deceptions,--\r\n\r\n    \"Ev'n in the circling floods refreshment craves,\r\n     And pines with thirst amidst a sea of waves;\r\n     When to the water he his lip applies,\r\n     Back from his lip the treacherous water flies.\"[64]\r\n\r\nNor is this all; hunger, thirst, weariness, and especially the action of\r\nthe solar heat upon the brain, determine a peculiar pathological\r\ncondition, a species of mental intoxication or delirium which powerfully\r\npredisposes the victim to hallucinations, and deprives the mind of that\r\nself-control which would enable it to chase away the phantoms that haunt\r\nit. To this affection, whose symptoms are frequently but erroneously\r\nconfounded with those of the mirage, the Arabs have given a specific\r\nname. They call it _Ragle_. A distinguished French traveller has\r\ndescribed it with exhaustive fulness,[65] and he attributes it to\r\nfatigue, excessive heat, and want of sleep.\r\n\r\nIt shows itself most commonly at night, and in dreams, attacks of\r\nnightmare, and a somnambulism of which the sufferer is perfectly\r\nconscious, without being able to throw it off. By day strange\r\nhallucinations affect the sight, the hearing, and even, though less\r\npowerfully, the senses of taste and smell. The aberration extends, as\r\nfar as the sight is concerned, to the objects which we are in the habit\r\nof seeing; a small stone, for instance, expands into a rock; the rut of\r\na carriage-wheel enlarges into the furrow of a freshly ploughed field; a\r\ntuft of grass or a bush will assume the grand proportions of a forest;\r\nand, what is remarkable, these objects seem always close at hand.\r\nAnother frequent error is the elevation of horizontal surfaces; the\r\nhorizon becomes a wall or a mountain. \"It has happened to myself,\" says\r\nM. d'Escayrac, \"to meet with walls constantly reappearing before me. My\r\nextended arm has plunged into the masonry, but my body never encountered\r\nany obstacle; the rampart opened to give me a free passage.\"\r\n\r\nHearing is, in its turn, affected. Then, any sound whatsoever, such as a\r\nfootfall, the blow of a stone, the whisper of the wind, is changed into\r\nmelodious sounds, keen cries of distress, the murmur of woods, the\r\nharmony of familiar songs.\r\n\r\nOne day, says M. d'Escayrac, I heard the click-clack of a village mill.\r\nEndeavouring to collect my senses, and to obtain an explanation of the\r\nsound, I perceived that it arose from the clink of my sword-belt against\r\nthe pommel of my saddle, to which I had buckled my sabre.\r\n\r\nJomard, the savant, who experienced the effects of the ragle during his\r\ntravels in Egypt, confirms in every respect the foregoing description.\r\nOn his way from Rosetta to Alexandria, he kept along the border of the\r\nsea, and found his feet painfully staggering in the thick fine sand.\r\nSuch a journey is necessarily one of extreme fatigue. After the first\r\nnight, this fatigue grew overwhelming; the traveller lost all accurate\r\nperception of objects, or of the form of places. The surface of the lake\r\nMedeah appeared not so much a sheet of water as a monotonous plain.\r\nConstantly pressing forward, he maintained a hard fight against the\r\noverpowering sense of slumber. Half-asleep, half-awake, his brain was\r\ndazzled with the most fantastic phantoms, and the hallucination was so\r\ngreat that he plunged into the lake before him, without perceiving it,\r\nthough the water was very deep. But the freshness caused by the\r\nevaporation of the water warned him of his error, and the vision\r\nsuddenly passed away.\r\n\r\nSuch being the phenomena of the Desert, one can understand the dreary\r\npicture which Dante paints in his \"Inferno,\" of--\r\n\r\n                                \"The plain\r\n    Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;\"\r\n\r\nwhose soil is--\r\n\r\n    \"Of an arid and thick sand;\"\r\n\r\nand where--\r\n\r\n                    \"With a gradual fall\r\n    Are raining down dilated flakes of fire.\r\n    As of the snow on Alp, without a wind.\"[66]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE LIFE IN THE DESERT:--THE OASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Flora_ of a region where nature provides no genial fertilizing\r\nrains, and whose soil is simply a shifting sand, moistened only in\r\ncertain places by a brackish water, must necessarily be one of extreme\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nIt is reduced very nearly, as we have seen, to a few plants of the genus\r\n_Salsola_ (salt-wort), flourishing on the borders of the salt pools and\r\nlakes. Nevertheless, at a few points, where a certain degree of fixity\r\nobtains in the sand, we meet with the thornless bushes or shrubs, the\r\n_Ephedra alata_ and the _retama Durioei_; some pistachios (_pistacia\r\nlentiscus_ and _p. terebinthus_); the \"drin\" (_aristida pungens_), a\r\ntall grass, with linear leaves, some seven feet high, to which the camel\r\nis very partial; and the \"ézel,\" a member of the family of Polygonaceæ,\r\nwhich botanists class with the allied buckwheat and knot-grasses, and\r\nwhich attains the stature of three to four feet. The latter plant throws\r\nout roots, which are generally uncovered, to a distance of twenty to\r\ntwenty-five feet; its woody stem spreads in its upper portion into\r\ngnarled branches, terminated each by a cluster of green, cylindrical and\r\nleafless twigs, which fall during winter. Elsewhere rise the tall trunks\r\nof the doum-palms, either isolated or assembled in scanty clumps, under\r\nwhich the traveller obtains with difficulty a modicum of shade, but\r\nwhich are otherwise of no value to him.\r\n\r\nIn districts where the surface is more broken up, notably in Palestine,\r\non the banks of the Jordan and the Dead Sea; in the Sinaitic Peninsula\r\nof Arabia; in the Nubian deserts of Naga, Aredah, and Bahiouda; finally,\r\neven in the Sahara, in the \"Desert of Erosion,\" and the table-land\r\nregion, vegetable life becomes more abundant and more varied, though\r\nstill but of mediocre interest. However, a curious arbustus, the\r\n_Limioniastrum Guyonianum_, shows itself very frequently in these damp\r\nlocalities, where it attains sometimes the dimensions of a tree. Its\r\nattenuated leaves are covered with saline efflorescence, and its\r\nparticles of rosy flowers relieve the monotony of the wilderness. In the\r\npermanent salt marshes, or _chotts_, some of the plants are analagous to\r\nthose formed in the bogs of Languedoc.\r\n\r\nAmong the plants of the Desert I must not forget the rose of Jericho\r\n(_Anastatica hierochuntica_),[67] an annual which contracts itself into\r\na ball, and, blown about by the breeze, seems a dead and withered mass\r\nof twigs. But plunge it into water, and it expands, regains the bloom of\r\nlife, affording a remarkable example of what is called \"revivification.\"\r\nThe fable respecting it is, that the first time it ever bloomed was on\r\nthe eve of the Nativity, and that its flower remained open until Easter.\r\n\r\nSeveral other vegetable species grow on the table-lands of the Algerine\r\nSahara, which are found elsewhere under similar conditions of soil and\r\nclimate. They are thorny shrubs and underwood, almost wholly belonging\r\nto the family of Salsolaceæ, or littoral plants, which only thrive on\r\nground impregnated with salt; there are also sub-frutescent plants,\r\npartly dried up by the sun. In some places the nakedness of the earth\r\nis concealed by the bloom of geraniums and heliotropes. Further, you may\r\nnotice in the region of the table-lands, the _Melantha punctuata_, a\r\nmember of the Colchicum tribe, which bears a bouquet of very white\r\nflowers grown upon the sand, and surrounded by a crown of ensheathed\r\nleaves. Not unworthy of rejoicing the eyes of the most fastidious\r\nconnoisseurs, it lives and dies unknown in the solitudes of the Sahara.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n1. Jujube Tree. 2. Lentiscus. 3. Tamarisk.]\r\n\r\nIn the hollows, where the earth preserves some degree of humidity, a\r\nfine soft sward prevails, of the most delicious emerald green; two\r\nherbs, the Alfa (_stipa tenacissima_) and the White Wormwood\r\n(_artemisia alba_),[68] often cover extended areas; the jujube trees\r\nclothe themselves in profuse foliage; the coloquinta stretches over the\r\nground its branches loaded with spherical fruit; and the tamarisk,\r\ndeveloped into a tree, waves in the wind its tufts of snowy and\r\nrose-hued flowers. It is in these meadows that the Arab rears his tent\r\nand pastures his flocks under a winter sky. The industrious and\r\nsedentary tribes seek in the oases a more benignant nature,--\r\n\r\n                          \"The yellow down\r\n    Bordered with palm, and many a winding vale\r\n    And meadow;\"\r\n\r\nand a soil which will repay their toil with liberal harvests. And it is\r\nthere only, in truth, that vegetation presents a development, a\r\ncontinuity, and sometimes even a variety, which recalls the fortunate\r\ncountries of the Mediterranean region.\r\n\r\nThe old geographer, Ptolemæus, compared the Sahara to a panther's skin,\r\nsprinkled with black spots on a tawny ground. These spots which, by an\r\neffect of contrast, are set off in black on the yellowish tint of the\r\ndesert, are the far-famed oases, which have furnished our poets and\r\nromancists with so many an appropriate image. Ptolemy's comparison is\r\nthe more accurate because these islands of verdure scattered over the\r\nsandy ocean,\r\n\r\n    \"Like precious stones set in a silver sea,\"\r\n\r\nhave, in general, a circular form. We must except, however, the grandest\r\nand most beautiful of all, Egypt. That immemorial land of mystery and\r\npower is enchased in the Desert region like any other oasis, and only\r\ndiffers in its greater extent and more elongated figure. It stretches\r\nalong the Nile like a ribbon--\r\n\r\n    \"And Egypt joys beneath the spreading wave.\"\r\n\r\nIts length, from Cairo to Assouan, is 450 miles. Its breadth does not\r\nexceed nine to twelve miles, except at Cairo, where it measures about\r\neighty miles along the sea-coast, which forms the base of a triangular\r\ndistrict known as the Delta ([Greek: delta]) of the Nile. The two other\r\nangles are marked by the cities of Pelusium and Alexandria. This long\r\nstrip of fertility is narrowly shut in between deserts of almost\r\nincredible sterility.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity worthy of attention, because it is the unique cause of the\r\nfertility of Egypt, is, that the valley of the Nile, instead of sloping\r\ndown on either side to the river-bank, assumes a gently convex form. It\r\nis owing to this slight convexity that, at the epoch of the\r\ninundation--beginning in June and ending in October--the Nile waters\r\noverflow to the right and to the left, rest upon the soil, and there\r\ndeposit their precious mud. How different the aspects of the country at\r\ndifferent seasons of the year! First, the bright sparkling sheets of\r\nfar-spreading and fertilising water; then the emerald green of the\r\ngrowing crops; lastly, the ripe warm yellow hues of the full harvest.\r\nWell might Amrou, the Arab conqueror of Egypt, remark to the Caliph\r\nOmar, that, \"according to the vicissitudes of the seasons, the face of\r\nthe country is adorned with a _silver_ wave, a verdant _emerald_, and\r\nthe deep _gold_ of an abundant harvest.\"\r\n\r\nThe soil of Egypt is, then, simply an alluvium mixed with the sand which\r\nthe winds bring from the Desert. Its aspect is that of a rich,\r\nwell-cultivated land, but bears the impress of a wearisome monotony. You\r\nsee there neither the dark dense forest, the rolling prairie, nor the\r\nundulating woodland; from the shore of the Mediterranean to the tropics\r\nyou meet everywhere with the same cultivation; the same mud-built\r\nvillages, with their dirty and winding streets; and ever the same clumps\r\nof palms, which would end by becoming tedious if it were not that their\r\nelegance of form invests them with an eternal beauty--if a glorious\r\nradiance did not gild with \"refined gold\" everything it touches--if,\r\nfinally, an after-glow of wondrous loveliness, of which the eye and soul\r\ncan never weary, which whenever seen suggests some new and subtle\r\nemotions, did not terminate every day by a crepuscular pomp of\r\nindescribable magnificence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n1. Doum-Palm. 2. Date-Palm. 3. Alfa (_Stipa tenacissima_).]\r\n\r\nThe Palm-tree is, in Egypt, as in all the oases, the principal element\r\nof the arborescent vegetation. But you also meet there with the banana,\r\nthe gum-tree, the orange, the jujube, the mulberry, the sycamore, and\r\nother tall trees, which were planted by command of Mehemet Ali, and have\r\nperfectly succeeded. The green banks of the river are diversified by\r\ncoppices of acacias and tamarisks. In the Fayoum district bloom\r\nimpervious hedges of cactus, and plantations of roses for the production\r\nof rosewater. Cereals yield four crops a-year; flax, hemp, indigo,\r\ncotton, the sugar-cane, prosper admirably; and under a climate where\r\nice, snow, and hail are unknown, not a month but has its burden of\r\nflowers and fruits. Abundant crops of vegetables are raised, even as in\r\nthose days when the Israelites in the wilderness bewailed \"the\r\ncucumbers and the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlics\" of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Charles Martins classes the Oases of the Sahara under three heads,\r\ncorresponding to his three sub-regions.[69]\r\n\r\nThe oasis of the Table Lands is watered by a stream or a copious spring.\r\nThat of the valleys of Erosion, by natural or artificial Artesian wells.\r\nThat of the Sandy Desert wants water. In the latter the palm-trees are\r\nplanted in conical cavities hollowed by the hand of man, that their\r\nroots may strike down to the subterranean reservoir which is to nourish\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEvery oasis is composed, in the main, of date-palms, which seem to form\r\na continuous forest; but in reality they are planted in rows, and in\r\ngardens separated from one another by walls of earth, which are pierced\r\nwith an aperture to admit of the entrance of the irrigating rill into\r\nthe enclosed square. The soil employed in the construction of the walls\r\nis removed from the paths, which are consequently below the surface, and\r\ncan be employed for a double purpose; they facilitate circulation in the\r\noases, and the waters, after having refreshed the gardens and revived\r\nthe soil, discharge themselves into these hollow ways, whence they flow\r\ntowards the chotts, or stagnate in swamps, which the lethargic Moslem\r\nnever thinks of draining. From such hotbeds of infection issues the\r\nmonster Fever every year, and slays its hundreds.\r\n\r\nIn case of need, every oasis becomes a fortress. Each \"square of flowery\r\nground\" is a redoubt; the assailant's bullet lodges in the earth wall,\r\nor if it pierces through, forms a new loophole in which the Arab plants\r\nhis gun to aim at his enemy. The villages themselves are encircled with\r\nwalls, flanked by towers, which remind the spectator of the picturesque\r\nfortifications of mediæval times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Date-Palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_) is _the_ tree of the Desert;\r\nthere only will its fruits ripen; without it, the Desert would be\r\nuninhabitable and uninhabited. Arab poesy represents it as a living\r\nbeing, created by God on the sixth day, at the same time as man. To\r\nexpress under what conditions it prospers, the imagination of the\r\nSaharan exaggerates the true, to render it the more palpable. \"This king\r\nof the oasis,\" he says, \"must plunge his feet in the water and raise his\r\nhead in the fire of heaven.\" Science, to a certain extent, confirms this\r\nseeming hyperbole; for it needs 5100° of heat accumulated during eight\r\nmonths for the date to ripen its fruit perfectly. If the sum of heat be\r\nless, the fruits set, but they do not grow to their full dimensions,\r\nremain bitter to the taste, and fail in the sugar and farina, which form\r\ntheir nutritive properties.\r\n\r\nThese conditions are realized in the climate of the Sahara. The mean\r\ntemperature of the year averages from sixty-eight to seventy-six\r\ndegrees, according to the locality. The heat commences in April, and\r\ndoes not cease until October. The thermometer seldom sinks in the cold\r\nseason more than two degrees below zero, and the date can endure six\r\ndegrees below zero.\r\n\r\nRain, as already stated, is rare in the Sahara; it falls in winter, and\r\nstimulates into a newly awakened life the vegetation which has been\r\ndrained of vigour by a summer sun. Sometimes they descend in torrents,\r\nbut these torrents, like our summer showers, are of briefest duration.\r\nAt Tongourt and Ouraegla whole years pass by without a drop of rain.\r\nDoes not the reader understand, then, the gratefulness of the Arabs\r\ntowards a tree which can derive its nourishment from the burning sand,\r\nthe scarcely less burning airs of heaven, and the brackish waters\r\nbeneath the soil which are fatal to all other kinds of vegetation--which\r\nretains its verdure fresh in the glare of a pitiless sun--which resists\r\nsuccessfully the winds that bow to the ground its flexible stem--which\r\nprovides him with beams and coverings for his tent, cordage for the\r\nharness of his horses and camels, fruit to satisfy his hunger and wine\r\nto quench his thirst--which is, moreover, \"a thing of beauty,\" and\r\ngladsome to the eye?\r\n\r\n    \"Those groups of lovely date-trees bending\r\n       Languidly their leaf-crowned heads,\r\n     Like youthful maids, when sleep descending,\r\n       Warns them to their silken beds.\"[70]\r\n\r\nWhat the vine is to the Italian, the oak to the Englishman, the\r\ncocoa-nut tree to the Polynesian, is the date-palm to the Arab. And\r\nmore--far more. This single tree has peopled the Desert. A civilization,\r\nrudimentary compared with that of the West, sufficiently advanced if you\r\ncontrast it with that of the Malay or the South Sea Islander, finds in\r\nit its standing-point, its centre, its support. And without it the\r\ntribes of the Sahara would cease to be.[71]\r\n\r\nThe wealth of an oasis is computed by the number of its palm trees. All\r\nof them, however, are not fruitful; for the date is dioecious. It has\r\nits males and its females. The males have flowers furnished with stamens\r\nonly, and form a closed-up, folded, grape-like ball, previous to the\r\nripening of the pollen in an envelope called the spathe. The females, on\r\nthe contrary, bear clusters of fruit also wrapped up in a spathe, but\r\nincapable of development until fecundated by the pollen or dust of the\r\nstamens. To multiply the date-trees, the Arabs do not sow the kernels of\r\nthe fruits, though they germinate with extreme facility, for it is\r\nimpossible to tell beforehand of what sex the tree will be; they prefer,\r\ntherefore, to detach a slip from the trunk of a female tree, and this\r\nbecomes fruitful at the expiry of eight years.\r\n\r\nThe male trees blossom, says Mr. Tristram,[72] in the month of March,\r\nand about the same time the case containing the female buds begins to\r\nopen. To impregnate these, a bunch of male flowers is carefully inserted\r\nand fastened in the calyx. Towards the beginning of July, when the fruit\r\nbegins to swell, the bunches are tied to the neighbouring branches.\r\n\r\nThe dates are ripe in October, at which time any premature rain is fatal\r\nto the crop, though the _roots_ require a daily watering. Not less\r\ninjurious are east winds in March and April. The tree when it begins to\r\nbear is about seven feet high. Each year the lowest ring of leaves falls\r\noff, so that the age of a palm may be roughly computed from the notches\r\non its stem. Its fruit begins to decline after a century, and the tree\r\nis then cut down for building purposes; but it will live for at least a\r\ncouple of hundred years. Some trees produce as many as twenty bunches,\r\nbut the average in a favourable season is from eight to ten bunches,\r\neach weighing from twelve to twenty pounds. Before the dates ripen, each\r\nproprietor is bound to set apart one tree in his garden, whose fruit is\r\nconsecrated for the service of the mosque and the use of the poor.\r\n\r\nFrom the juice of the date the Arab obtains a sweet fermented liquor,\r\ncalled \"laguni,\" of which he is inordinately fond. He makes an incision\r\nin the top of the tree, taking care to strike home to the centre. A\r\nfunnel is attached, by which the sap flows into a vessel at the rate of\r\nabout three quarts every morning for ten to sixteen days. The incision\r\nrequires to be opened afresh daily.\r\n\r\nThe cabbage, or soft pith and young unfolded leaves at the summit of the\r\nstem, in taste approaching the chestnut, is also eaten, but only when\r\nthe tree has fallen or been felled, as the loss of its crown invariably\r\ndestroys it.\r\n\r\nThere are fifteen varieties of dates, of which the _dghetnour_ is\r\nconsidered the best for keeping, and three other kinds are preferred\r\nfresh.\r\n\r\nThe crest of the full-grown trees rises about fifty feet above the\r\nground. The air circulates freely under the leafy canopy formed by their\r\ninterlacing branches, but the sun's rays do not penetrate. Shade, air,\r\nand water--these three elements permit the most varied cultivation in\r\nthe palm-gardens, despite the scorching heats of summer. The fruit trees\r\nwhich flourish are the fig, the pomegranate, the apricot; less\r\nfrequently, the vine and the olive; still more rarely, the peach, the\r\npear, and the orange. Vegetables are commonly cultivated during winter;\r\nsuch as turnips, cabbages, onions, carrots, beans, and pimento\r\n(_Capsicum annuum_), an indispensable condiment for those Arab sauces\r\n(_merga_) destined to stimulate the digestive energies of a people who\r\nabstain from alcoholic liquors. You may also remark pumpkins, gourds,\r\nand water-melons; small squares of lucerne, which yield as many as eight\r\ncrops yearly; the henna (_Lawsonia inermis_), which tints with yellow\r\nthe nails of the Arab women; and tobacco (_Nicotiana rustica_),\r\ncultivated most largely in the Souf. In winter you may refresh your eyes\r\nin the clearings of the oasis with verdurous fields, green with barleys\r\nand early wheats springing vigorously from the earth. The cultivation of\r\ncotton, though considerably stimulated by the failure of the usual\r\nsupply from the Southern States of America, is still in its infancy.\r\nThere can be little doubt, however, that with improved methods of\r\nirrigation it will be considerably and successfully developed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe oases of the table-land region, fertilized, as we have already seen,\r\nby the streams of fresh water which flow down from the mountains and\r\nspread abroad in natural or artificial channels, are much the most\r\nfertile, and also the most healthy. They possess, moreover, the\r\ninestimable advantage of being but a short distance from the\r\nMediterranean region, in a country less arid and less desolate than the\r\nremainder of the Desert. I may name, among these oases, those of\r\nEl-Kantara, Biskra, and El-Outaïa, which form a sort of chaplet, and are\r\nwatered by the same river.\r\n\r\nThe oasis of El-Kantara is the first we encounter on quitting the\r\nMediterranean region to penetrate into the Sahara through the gloomy and\r\nprecipitous ravine entitled \"The Mouth of the Desert.\" It is situated\r\n1800 feet above the sea-level. Its length is 5000 yards. Fournel, the\r\nfirst geologist who examined it (in 1864), christened it the Hyères of\r\nthe Sahara. Its temperature is cool and equable, and does but just\r\nsuffice to enable the dates to ripen. It possesses upwards of 76,000\r\npalm-trees, sheltering under their leafy shadow legions of apricots,\r\npomegranates, and fig-trees. In the centre of this pleasant and fruitful\r\nshade houses of brick, with flat roofs and narrow loop-holed windows,\r\nsurround a square tower. The ancient watch-towers have fallen into\r\ndecay. Before France took under its \"protection\" the peaceful Berbers\r\nwho cultivate the oasis, these towers were useful as posts of\r\nobservation whence to descry the approach of the wandering Arabs, who\r\nresort in summer to the pastures of the mountains, and in winter to\r\nthose of the Sahara.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a type of the oasis of the Desert of Erosion, let us take that of\r\nOuargla, the last which submitted to the French in South Algeria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Street in Ouargla.]\r\n\r\nIt is situated in a profound hollow. In form it is elliptical, with its\r\nmajor axis measuring about five thousand yards, and its minor about\r\nthree thousand. The palms are planted at the rate of ten to eleven\r\nhundred a hectare (two acres); they attain to extraordinary dimensions,\r\nand their dense foliage over-arches a small world of fruit trees.\r\nOutside the gardens grow some wild date-palms, which yield a smaller\r\ncrop, but whose fruit is much more savoury. Two avenues, or clearings,\r\nbisecting the forest from north to south, lead to the _q'sour_, or\r\nvillage, of Ouargla. This _q'sour_, like every other, is built of\r\nsun-dried earth, and surrounded by a circular rampart in very bad\r\ncondition, six to thirteen feet in height, and four and a-half feet\r\nthick at the base. It is flanked with loop-holed towers, and encircled\r\nexternally by a muddy moat, crossed by six causeways leading to as many\r\ngates.\r\n\r\nBefore some of these gates are planted the small entrenched camps,\r\nwherein the Arab shepherds of the neighbourhood take refuge with their\r\nflocks what time the oasis is menaced by an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe _q'sour_ of Ouargla is divided into three quarters, inhabited by\r\nthree tribes, who do not live always on the most friendly terms. In\r\nappearance it resembles the Saharan _q'sours_, which have all a strong\r\nfamily likeness; there are the mosque, and the governor's residence, and\r\nthe open market-place, and the narrow squalid streets, often obstructed\r\nby heaps of unclean and unsavoury rubbish; and the low dull houses,\r\npierced with holes instead of windows, which have seldom any shutters;\r\nso that the traveller, when he penetrates into these dismal quarters, is\r\nstartled by the contrast which they present to the picture of enchanted\r\npalaces full of shade, perfume, and freshness, drawn by his eager\r\nimagination. Our poets and romancists have much to answer for. Their\r\nideal East is very different from that actual East, in all its heat, and\r\nnoisomeness, and glare, which the voyager finds around him, and which\r\nseems to have lost much of its beauty along with its grandeur and its\r\npower. Pleasant to the fancy is the palm-grove, pleasant the garden with\r\nits golden and purple fruitage, but the warm (and often mineral) waters\r\nwhich irrigate, or rather inundate the soil, exhale the most deleterious\r\nemanations, so that the unfortunate inhabitants are constantly decimated\r\nby fever, blinded by ophthalmic disease, and devoured by insects!\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the Desert of Erosion is watered by means of\r\nartesian wells, natural or artificial. The latter have been known to the\r\npeoples of the Sahara from the remotest antiquity; but the implements\r\nand the methods employed to bore or preserve them were, as the reader\r\nwill suppose, very rude and unsatisfactory. The sides of the well are\r\nonly supported by a framework of palm-wood, which decays very quickly;\r\nthe well gets choked; divers descend with baskets to clear away the\r\nsand; but after awhile the evil exceeds their power of remedying it.\r\n\"Then, for want of water,\" says M. Martins, \"the palms grow sick and\r\nperish; the villages are emptied of their population; the oasis\r\ncontracts its boundaries, and gradually disappears. The Desert resumes\r\npossession of the demesne which the labour of man had temporarily won\r\nfor it.\" Fortunately, in the track of the French army have trodden the\r\nFrench engineers, with all the wonderful apparatus that Science places\r\nat their disposal, and in numerous places they have excavated true\r\nartesian wells, similar to those which supply some of our great towns.\r\nAnd thus many oases which were on the point of perishing have been\r\nsaved, others have been created, and the conquest of the Desert by\r\nmodern industry is henceforth no more than a question of time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe oases of the Sandy Desert, as I have said, are not watered. They\r\nonly possess such wells as suffice, more or less, for the needs of the\r\npoor cultivators. As for the palms, and other nutritive vegetables, they\r\nare planted at the bottom of conical excavations some eighteen,\r\ntwenty-five, or thirty feet in depth; so that at a short distance you\r\nonly see their crests rising above the sandy soil like large tufts of\r\nherbage. The slopes around these hollow gardens are stayed indifferently\r\nwell by a matting of palm leaves. The well itself is placed in the\r\ncentre, and its depth does not exceed five-and-twenty feet. Nothing can\r\nbe more precarious than these oases, which a gust of wind may bury under\r\nan avalanche of sand. Yet the men are cleaner in their person, neater in\r\nattire, and livelier in spirit--the women are less wretched and less\r\noppressed--and the houses better built and better provided than in the\r\ngreat _q'sours_ of the upper regions. In the Souf, the sandy region of\r\nthe Eastern Sahara, the industrious inhabitants of these oases remain at\r\npeace in the midst of the tumults and insurrections of their turbulent\r\nneighbours, and appear fully sensible of the advantages they undoubtedly\r\nderive from the firm and impartial rule of the French Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe artist who wishes to represent the broad expanse of Ocean's \"liquid\r\nplain,\" does not fail to animate it with the white canvas of the\r\nlabouring ships. If he paints the Desert, his picture would be divided\r\nby a horizontal line into two parts--the blue heaven, the yellow sand;\r\nthe latter, an undulating sea, with a few clumps of palms in the\r\nbackground, and in the foreground, to enliven the too monotonous scene,\r\na group or so of camels. The camel is, in fact, the indispensable\r\naccessory of every view of the Desert, as the ship of every marine\r\npainting; which justifies once more the Arab designation of \"ship of the\r\nDesert\" or \"terrestrial ship\" (_gouareb el beurr_).\r\n\r\nIn Book the First I have spoken of the Camel properly so-called, or\r\ncamel with two humps, which is peculiar to Central and Eastern Asia. The\r\ncamel of Arabia and Africa is the dromedary. The latter is employed\r\nconjointly with the two-humped camel in the westernmost countries of\r\nAsia: in Egypt, and in Nubia, he is much more widely spread than his\r\ncongener, which is nearly unknown in the rest of Africa. The dromedary\r\nhas but one hump. His hair is soft, woolly, moderately long about the\r\nbody, longer and much thicker on the hump, the head, the neck, and the\r\nshoulders. Its colour varies from a reddish-brown to a clear yellow.\r\nZoologists recognize three varieties of this species:--The _Brown\r\ndromedary_, also called, but improperly, the Caucasian dromedary--he is\r\nbrown, like the Bactrian camel, and his short squat limbs indicate\r\nstrength rather than agility; the _White dromedary_, of a very\r\ntransparent colour, and of slender figure; and the _Egyptian dromedary_,\r\nlarger than either of the preceding, and with body and limbs uniformly\r\nclothed in short gray hair. But the Arabs distinguish only two races:\r\nthe _Djemel_, or camel of burden, which is no other, probably, than the\r\nCaucasian dromedary; and the _Mahari_, or camel for the saddle and war,\r\nwhose name seems to apply equally to the two other varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. The Mahari. 2. The Djemel.]\r\n\r\nThe mahari is to the djemel what our chargers are to our carthorses, or,\r\nas the Arabs say, what the _djend_ (noble) is to the _kheddim_ (the\r\nservant). He has a very sure foot, a free, sustained, and rapid trot;\r\nhe is sober, enduring, and courageous; a true courser, and the nomade's\r\ninseparable friend and companion. His training is a matter of the\r\nhighest importance, and skilfully adapted to develop all his best\r\nqualities and highest faculties.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs of the Tell assert that the maharis accomplish in one day ten\r\ntimes the march of a caravan, or a hundred leagues; but the best in\r\nblood and breeding do not generally exceed a daily journey of from\r\nthirty-five to forty leagues.\r\n\r\nThe young mahari has his place in the Arab's tent. The children play\r\nwith him; he is a recognized member of the family; custom and gratitude\r\nattach him to his masters, whom he divines to be his friends.\r\n\r\nIf the djemel be not as noble as the mahari, he is not less useful.\r\nWithout him, all relations would be suspended between the peoples of the\r\nSahara; the Soudan, wide, populous, and fertile as it is, would be a\r\n_terra incognita_; he is the sole means of intercommunication possible\r\nin the arid wastes of the Desert.\r\n\r\nAlike living and dead, he is the fortune of his master.\r\n\r\nLiving, he carries the tents and the provisions; he makes war, he\r\ncarries on commerce; that he might be patient, God (say the Arabs)\r\ncreated him without gall; he fears neither hunger nor thirst, fatigue\r\nnor heat; his hair is woven into the burnous and the tent-stuff; the\r\nmilk of the female nourishes rich and poor, and fattens the horses; it\r\nis \"a spring which does not dry up.\"[73]\r\n\r\nDead, all his flesh is excellent eating; his hump (_deroua_) forms the\r\ndaintiest dish at the banquet; in the bottles made of his skin, the\r\nwater is neither consumed by wind nor sun; the shoes fashioned from it\r\nmay tread unhurt upon the viper, and will save the traveller's feet from\r\nburning wounds (_haffa_); denuded of its hair, afterwards soaked in\r\nwater, and simply applied to a wooden saddle, without nails or pegs, it\r\nadheres to it, like the bark to the tree, and communicates to the whole\r\na solidity which will defy war, the chase, and the foray.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the mahari consists in this, that to all his own\r\npeculiar qualities he adds those of the djemel. His inferiority arises\r\nfrom the difficulty of his training, which consumes for more than a year\r\nall his master's time without compensation, and from the fact that\r\nanimals of his race are few in number.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRIPED HYÆNAS OF THE SAHARA.]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the poet or the artist for a picture of the Desert, we\r\nfind it peopled with animals of a very unsatisfactory character: the\r\nlion, the leopard, the panther, in quest of prey, seeking whom they may\r\ndevour, or troops of hyænas and jackals, tearing with keen teeth the\r\ncorpses of men and animals.\r\n\r\n    \"With these, lean dogs in herds obscene repair,\r\n     And every kind that snuffs the tainted air.\"--(_Lucan._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACKALS DISINTERING DEAD BODIES.]\r\n\r\nOthers diversify the scene with the graceful form of the gazelle, with\r\nthe ungainly body, immensely long neck, and spotted hide of the giraffe;\r\nor with the ostrich, the camel of the bird-world, spreading his plumes\r\nto the wind, and flying with swift feet from the hunter or the wild\r\nbeast that pursues him. But, in truth, these are bold fancies, artistic\r\nor poetic licenses, rather than exact representations of what one really\r\nsees in the Desert; and most of the animals with which we people, at our\r\npleasure, the immense solitudes of Africa and Asia actually belong to\r\nneighbouring regions of a less arid character. And, in the first place,\r\nthe lion of the Desert is a myth, or nearly so. \"When you speak,\" says\r\nCarrette, \"to the inhabitants of the Desert of these ferocious beasts\r\nwhich Europeans give them as companions, they reply with imperturbable\r\ncoolness, 'You have, then, in your own country, lions which drink air\r\nand browse on leaves? But, among us, lions must have running water and\r\nlive flesh. Therefore they only appear in those parts of the Sahara\r\nwhere are wooded hills and an abundance of water. We dread nothing but\r\nthe viper (_lefa_) and the innumerable swarms of mosquitoes; the latter\r\nbeing found wherever any humidity prevails.'\"[74]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Gypaëtos, or Bearded Vulture. 2. Sociable Vulture. 3.\r\nCathartes Percnopterus.]\r\n\r\nWhat Carrette relates of the lion is also true of the other carnivora,\r\nof the panther and the leopard, as well as of the hyæna and the jackal.\r\nIt is surely easy to understand that these animals greatly prefer to\r\nsojourn in fertile and well-watered countries, where they enjoy\r\nfreshness, shelter, copious supplies of water, and abundant prey, than\r\nin hot glaring plains of sand, which offer them no asylum, and where\r\nthey run the risk of perishing of hunger and thirst. It is, then, only\r\non exceptional occasions that the lions and other large _felidæ_ of\r\nAfrica issue from their caverns or their lairs, and wander into the\r\nDesert (properly so called) in pursuit of prey. The hyæna and the jackal\r\nventure there more willingly. We know that these carnivora only attack\r\nliving animals at the last extremity; their food is the dead and even\r\nputrid flesh; it is a nutriment which costs them less trouble to obtain,\r\nand probably, also, most pleases their taste. Thus, it is by no means an\r\nuncommon occurrence to see them in the towns and _q'sours_, devouring\r\nthe carrion, or in the cemeteries disinterring the corpses; they follow\r\nalso in the Desert the caravans and detachments of troops on the march,\r\nand at night prowl around their encampments, in the hope of some\r\nwindfall, which they seldom expect in vain, but which the dogs, the\r\nvultures (_Cathartes percnopterus_ and _vultur fulvus_), the _gypaëtos_,\r\nand the crows rarely fail to dispute with them.\r\n\r\nThe region of the table-lands, or Saharan Steppes, the valleys of\r\nErosion, and certain parts of the Gobi--Persia, Syria, and Arabia--which\r\nare not absolutely deprived of rain, or which are refreshed by\r\nmountain-streams, nourish several species of mammifers: gazelles,\r\nhedgehogs, porcupines, hares, offering both to man and the carnivora an\r\nabundant variety of game. Of all these animals, the most interesting are\r\nthe gazelles, several species of which inhabit the desert region. I\r\nshall refer in the first place to the gazelle properly so called, or\r\n_Antilope dorcas_, so remarkable for the grace of his movements, his\r\nslender limbs, and the expressive gentleness of his eyes. This beautiful\r\nspecies is common in Central Sahara, Nubia, and Asia. He lives in\r\nnumerous troops, is of small stature, with a yellowish or yellow-brown\r\nskin on the back, and a white belly, a brown or blackish belt marking\r\nthe sides. The horns, larger and stronger in the male than in the\r\nfemale, have a double curve, are lyrated, and without projections. The\r\nAriel Gazelle is about twenty inches high at the shoulder. The _Gazella\r\nSoemmeringii_ belongs to Abyssinia and Sennaar. The gazelle _nanguer_\r\nis found as far as Morocco, Nubia, and in the Cordofou; some varieties\r\noccur at the Senegal. Finally, the oryx-leucoryx inhabits Tropical\r\nAfrica, and rarely makes his appearance in the Deserts; he differs from\r\nthe gazelle in his arched horns, but his skin is nearly the same.\r\nAlthough the gazelles are generally considered extremely timid animals,\r\nwhich, moreover, their weakness would fully justify, they display on\r\nemergency a surprising courage. When they cannot escape from danger\r\nthrough agility, they bravely confront the enemy which attacks them.\r\nMenaced by a panther or a leopard, they form themselves into a circle,\r\nwhich, bristling everywhere with keen-pointed horns, compels the\r\nantagonist to retreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1. Gazelle.\r\n  2. Antelope (_Oryx-leucoryx_).\r\n  3. Gazelle (_of Soemmering_).\r\n  4. Nanguer.]\r\n\r\nIn the deserts of Africa and Arabia the traveller frequently meets with\r\nsmall rodents, which excavate their burrows in the sandy soil, and only\r\nissue from them at night in quest of food. These are the jerboas and\r\njerbilles. The jerboas are easily recognized by the length of their\r\nhind-legs and the disposition of their toes--three to each hind-foot,\r\nthe middle larger than the rest; five to each fore-foot; and all\r\nfurnished with sharp, strong, crooked claws; their structure resembling\r\nthat of the _raptores_ among birds. These animals leap with great\r\ncelerity, and to an extraordinary distance. The tail, which is a fifth\r\nlonger than the body, and terminated by a tuft of black hair, forms at\r\none and the same time a sort of balance, a rudder, and a lever. It\r\nenables the jerboa to preserve his equilibrium, and to direct himself\r\nwhen he has taken his spring; or, in a state of repose, furnishes him\r\nwith a substantial support.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAZELLES OF ARABIA OPPOSING A PANTHER.]\r\n\r\nThe jerboas constitute, in the family of _dipodidæ_, a tribe composed of\r\nseveral species, which are found in eastern and central Europe, Asia,\r\nand Africa.\r\n\r\nThe jerbilles, owing to the similarity of name, are often confounded\r\nwith the jerboas; but the only things they have in common are a certain\r\nconformity of habits, and a nearly equal aptitude for leaping.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, their organization rather resembles that of the rat, along\r\nwith which it is classed by zoologists. Their hind-legs are much shorter\r\nthan those of the jerboa, and their tail is garnished with but a few\r\nshort, stiff hairs. Like the jerboas, they inhabit the sandy\r\nwildernesses of Africa, Asia, and eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JERBOAS ATTACKED BY A HORNED VIPER.]\r\n\r\nThese small animals, exclusively frugivorous and graminivorous, seem\r\nable, in the solitary places where they make their retreats, to multiply\r\nthemselves _ad infinitum_; but, while a great number perish through\r\nfamine, they are also decimated by a host of enemies in the reptiles of\r\nthe Desert, and especially by the terrible horned viper, or _cerastes_,\r\nand a great saurian, intermediate between the lizard and crocodile--the\r\n\"varan of the Desert.\"\r\n\r\nThe horned viper (_vipera cerastes_) is thus named on account of the two\r\nhorns or protuberances on its forehead, which give it a physiognomy\r\nmore hideous, perhaps, than that of any of its congeners. It attains the\r\nlength of two to three feet. Its head is depressed, very obtuse, swollen\r\nbehind the eyes, and, so to speak, truncated in front. Its body, cased\r\nin shells of a tawny-like yellow, marked with brown spots, blends\r\ncuriously with the sand, half-buried in which it lurks to surprise its\r\nprey or escape from its enemies. The cerastes frequents the deserts of\r\nLybia, Arabia, the Sahara, and the valley of the Nile. Its bite is\r\nexceedingly dangerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Varan of the Nile. 2. Varan of the Desert.]\r\n\r\nThe _varans_, or _monitors_, called also _tupinambis_ by the ancient\r\nnaturalists, form a genus represented in tropical climes by several\r\nspecies of great size. English writers commonly designate them monitors,\r\nthe French sauvegardes, because they frequent the haunts of crocodiles\r\nand alligators, and give warning of their approach by a whistling sound.\r\nTwo species belong to Africa: one, aquatic, the varan of the Nile\r\n(_varanus dracæna_); the other, sand-burrowing, the varan of the Desert\r\n(_varanus sunius_, or _arenarius_), called by the Arabs\r\n_onaran-el-ard_. Their usual size is from three feet to three feet four\r\ninches. The varan of the Nile wears an armour of alternately green and\r\nblack scales. Its congener exhibits a mixture of brown and yellow, more\r\nsuitable to its sandy lairs. It is rare in the Sahara, but common enough\r\nin the deserts of Egypt, Syria, and Nubia.\r\n\r\nPoor as may be the Fauna of the Desert, there is yet cause enough for\r\nastonishment that the species which compose it, especially the\r\nherbivora, should be able to find subsistence in these seas of sand,\r\nwhere they can find but a few saline plants scattered at rare intervals,\r\nand where fresh water is almost wholly wanting. It is, however, well\r\nknown now-a-days that the wilderness provides its denizens with an\r\naliment, which is sometimes very abundant, suitable for man, the camel,\r\nand the beasts, and is considered identical by many authorities with the\r\n_manna_ of the Bible.[75] This substance is a cryptogamous vegetable,\r\nvariously christened _lichen esculentus_ (Acharius), _lecanora\r\nesculenta_ (Pallas), _luttarut_ (by the Arabs), and _vasseh-el-ard_, or\r\n\"earth-dung\" (by the Algerines). It sometimes forms on the sand, in the\r\nmorning, a layer one or two inches in thickness, and appears to have\r\ndropped from heaven, or to have sprung spontaneously from the soil,\r\nduring the night. It is probable that its spores, transported by the\r\nwind, are developed by the humidity which is condensed through the\r\nnocturnal coldness.\r\n\r\nA shower of this lichen was observed, in April 1846, in the Russian\r\ngovernment of Wilna. It covered the soil for three or four inches in\r\ndepth, and the inhabitants lived upon it for several days. Its form is\r\nthat of a small, anfractuous, rounded grain, about the size of a pea,\r\nexternally of a gray colour, but white and farinaceous within. Its taste\r\nis weak, amygdalaceous, with a faint, mushroom-like aroma. Boiled in\r\nwater, it swells, becomes gelatinous, and may be served up in various\r\nways. In the Sahara, as well as in Arabia, it adheres to any foreign\r\nbody. Cattle feed upon it eagerly. It certainly facilitates digestion,\r\nand contains all the assimilating principles which form the constituents\r\nof the wholesomest vegetable food. Such as it is, the _lichen\r\nesculentus_ is an inestimable boon to the wandering tribes of the\r\nDesert, who would perish of hunger in years of famine but for its\r\nheaven-sent nutriment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE MEN OF THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I use the terms \"Men of the Desert,\" \"Populations of the Desert,\"\r\nevidently I must not be understood to employ them in their absolute\r\nsense. Man, no more than that other so-called \"lord of animals\"--the\r\nlion, makes a voluntary sojourn in countries where game, verdure, and\r\nfresh water are wanting. The peoples whom we entitle \"Inhabitants of the\r\nDesert\" are then, in reality, those who dwell upon its borders or in its\r\noases, but whom the necessity of traversing and frequently abiding in it\r\nhas familiarized with its gloom and its peril, as a similar necessity\r\nhas familiarized the mariner with the ocean. We have seen, however, that\r\nsome pastoral tribes pitch their tents and pasture their flocks in those\r\ndistricts where vegetation is favoured and cherished by a supply of rain\r\nor subterranean waters, and which should more accurately be designated\r\nas Steppes than Deserts. Some authorities have, indeed, affixed the name\r\nof \"the Saharan Steppe\" to the region of high table-lands which lies at\r\nthe base of the Atlas range.\r\n\r\nOther groups, who are partly shepherds and partly hunters, inhabit, in\r\nthe Southern and Western Sahara, those plateaux where ostriches,\r\ngazelles, and hares abound. The more peaceful and industrious tribes\r\noccupy the oases. As for those who encamp or habitually wander in the\r\nSandy Desert--where all cultivation is impossible, where the herds can\r\nobtain but an insufficient pasture, where game very seldom shows\r\nitself-the reader will suppose that they can only subsist by plundering\r\nor ransoming the caravans. These are the rovers, the pirates of the Sea\r\nof Sand. There are \"land-rats,\" Shakspeare tells us, as well as\r\n\"water-rats.\" Others, again, there are who seem convinced that \"honesty\r\nis the best policy,\" who give themselves up exclusively to commercial\r\ntransactions, and act as agents and intermediaries between nations\r\nseparated from one another by leagues of rock and sand, for the exchange\r\nof their respective products. It might be said of these that they\r\ndischarged a useful and honourable function, if the purchase and sale of\r\nslaves were not the most ordinary, and unfortunately the most lucrative,\r\nof their operations.\r\n\r\nIn our previous examination of the peoples of the Steppes, we discovered\r\nthat all were more or less directly sprung from the same sources;--the\r\nyellow or Mongolian race, which blends in the north with the Hyperborean\r\nrace, and in the west with the Japhetic or Indo-Germanic. We have now to\r\nnote a not less remarkable fact--that the whole Desert zone is likewise\r\noccupied by one family, the Semitic, modified in certain parts of Africa\r\nby commixture with the Negro race. Soon we shall see the latter peopling\r\nof itself the plains of Central and Southern Africa; the\r\nMalayo-Polynesian and Papuan, but slightly distinguished from the\r\npreceding, in possession of the islands of the Indian Ocean, those of\r\nOceania, and the Australian continent; the Hyperborean race, scattered\r\nthrough the Arctic solitudes; and, finally, the \"Red Man,\" gradually\r\ndying away among the prairies and forests of the two Americas: so that,\r\nto each of the great divisions of the Savage or Desert World corresponds\r\none of the great fractions of the human species.\r\n\r\nThe Shemites--so named because the Bible attributes their origin to\r\nShem, the eldest son of Noah--are now-a-days represented only by the\r\nJews and the Arabs, though they formerly included also the Assyrians,\r\nthe Chaldæans or Babylonians, the Syrians, Phoenicians, and\r\nEthiopians. Of their modern representatives, the Jews alone have\r\ndisplayed any real aptitude for civilization. The Arabs, whose name is\r\nderived from the word _Arâba_, which signifies \"desert,\" seem almost\r\nexclusively adapted for a nomadic life; and it is to them can most\r\ncorrectly be applied the characteristics which Renan too broadly\r\nattributes to the entire Shemitic race.\r\n\r\n\"As far as concerns the civil and political life,\" says that\r\ndistinguished orientalist, \"the Shemites are distinguished by the same\r\ncharacter of simplicity. They have never understood civilization in the\r\nsense which we apply to the word. We do not find among them any great\r\norganized empires, or commerce, or public spirit--nothing which recalls\r\nthe absolute monarchy of Egypt and Persia. The true Shemitic society is\r\nthat of the tent and the tribe: it owns no political or judiciary\r\ninstitution; its principle is, man free, without any controlling\r\nauthority, and without any other security than that of the family tie.\r\nThe questions of aristocracy, democracy, feudality, which sum up all the\r\nhistory of the Aryan peoples, have no meaning for the Shemites.\r\nAristocracy, not having among them a military origin, is accepted\r\nwithout protest and without repugnance. The Shemitic nobility is purely\r\npatriarchal: it owes nothing to conquest; it has its origin in blood.\"\r\n\r\nAs far as their physique is concerned, the Arabs are in general tall,\r\nthin, nimble, not very strong. Their face is pale and long, their\r\nforehead low, their nose aquiline, their mouth large, their chin\r\nreceding. The complexion is brown, as becomes those who live for months\r\nunder a glaring sun; the eyes are keen and glowing; the port is free and\r\neven haughty. They have black hair and beard.\r\n\r\nOf their history, prior to the day when Mohammed's genius knit them into\r\na great proselytizing military people, little certain is known. A\r\nShemitic tribe, descended from Joktan, grandson of Shem, settled in\r\nArabia at a remote period of antiquity, and Joktan's great-grandson,\r\nHimzar or Homin, founded a dynasty which ruled in Yemen for upwards of\r\ntwo thousand years. Even the Romans could not utterly subdue them, but\r\ngradually the different tribes fell apart from one another, and for\r\ncenturies waged against each other the most desperate wars, until\r\nMohammed supplied them with a rallying-point in the creed of Islam.\r\nThenceforth their mission was to propagate the new faith by fire and\r\nsword, and bursting from their rocky highlands like a torrent, they\r\npoured along the shores of the Mediterranean to Gibraltar on the north,\r\nand Tangier on the south. In Northern Africa they gradually mingled with\r\nthe Berbers, the Numidians, and the Getulians, and from the fusion\r\nsprang the Kabyles, the Tibbous, and the Touaregs, while the Shemites\r\nthemselves lost a portion of their original character.\r\n\r\nAll the tribes of the desert are Moslems. The precepts of the Koran, and\r\ncertain traditional usages, are almost the only laws which they\r\nrecognize.\r\n\r\nThe Koran authorizes polygamy, and the Arab women, therefore, are less\r\nthe wives than the slaves of their husbands, who enforce upon them the\r\nstrictest seclusion, and impose upon them the most arduous labours. The\r\ntyranny which weighs upon the women is, however, in inverse proportion\r\nto the degree of welfare and civilization of the various tribes. Among\r\nthe poor and almost barbarous peoples of the desert, these unfortunate\r\ncreatures are reduced to a condition of degradation and brutishness\r\nwhich inspires in the European almost as much disgust as pity.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of rapine which most writers have signalized as one of the\r\nleading features of the Arab character, appears to have been greatly\r\nexaggerated, or, at least, too much generalized. This vice is a special\r\nresult of their position, and, we must own, of the very antiquated views\r\nthey hold upon the \"rights of man,\" which, indeed, they sum up in much\r\nthe same manner as Wordsworth's _Rob Roy_:--[76]\r\n\r\n    \"The creatures see of flood and field,\r\n     And those that travel on the wind!\r\n     With them no strife can last; they live\r\n      In peace, and peace of mind.\r\n\r\n    \"For why?--because the good old rule\r\n     Sufficeth them, the simple plan,\r\n     _That they should take who have the power,_\r\n       _And they should keep who can_.\"\r\n\r\nWe must also take into account the spirit of hostility which their\r\nreligion fosters against the infidel--against, that is, all who do not\r\naccept the laws of the Prophet. \"The sword,\" says Mohammed, \"is the key\r\nof heaven and of hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a night\r\nspent in arms, is of more avail than two months of fasting or prayer:\r\nwhosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven: at the day of judgment\r\nhis wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion and odoriferous as musk;\r\nand the loss of his limbs shall be supplied by the wings of angels and\r\ncherubim.\" Such a declaration could not but fire the enthusiasm of the\r\nArab, and whet their swords against the enemies of Islam.\r\n\r\nThe leading features of his character have been discriminated by Gibbon\r\nwith his usual sagacity, and described with his wonted stateliness of\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\"In private life,\" he says,[77] \"every man, at least every family, is\r\nthe judge and avenger of his own cause. The nice sensibility of honour,\r\nwhich weighs the insult rather than the injury, sheds its deadly venom\r\non the quarrels of the Arabs; the honour of their women, and their\r\n_beards_, is most easily wounded; an indecent action, a contemptuous\r\nword, can be expiated only by the blood of the offender; and such is\r\ntheir patient inveteracy, that they expect whole months and years the\r\nopportunity of revenge. A fine or compensation for murder is familiar to\r\nthe barbarians of every age; but with the Arabs the kinsmen of the dead\r\nare at liberty to accept the atonement, or to exercise with their own\r\nhands the law of retaliation. Their refined malice refuses even the head\r\nof the murderer, substitutes an innocent for the guilty person, and\r\ntransfers the penalty to the best and most considerable of the race by\r\nwhom they have been injured. If he falls by their hands, they are\r\nexposed in their turn to the danger of reprisals, the interest and\r\nprincipal of the bloody debt are accumulated; the individuals of either\r\nfamily lead a life of malice and suspicion, and fifty years may\r\nsometimes elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled.\r\nThis sanguinary spirit, ignorant of pity or forgiveness, has been\r\nmoderated, however, by the maxims of honour, which require in every\r\nprivate encounter some decent equality of age and strength, of numbers\r\nand weapons....\r\n\r\n\"According to the remark of Pliny, the Arabian tribes are equally\r\naddicted to theft and merchandize; the caravans that traverse the desert\r\nare ransomed or pillaged; and their neighbours, since the remote times\r\nof Job and Sesostris, have been the victims of their rapacious spirit.\r\nIf a Bedouin discovers from afar a solitary traveller, he rides\r\nfuriously against him, crying, with a loud voice, 'Undress thyself, thy\r\naunt (my wife) is without a garment.' A ready submission entitles him to\r\nmercy; resistance will provoke the aggressor, and his own blood must\r\nexpiate the blood which he presumes to shed in legitimate defence. A\r\nsingle robber, or a few associates, are branded with their genuine name;\r\nbut the exploits of a numerous band assume the character of lawful and\r\nhonourable war. The temper of a people thus armed against mankind, was\r\ndoubly inflamed by the domestic license of rapine, murder, and revenge.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of \"Bedouins\" (from _bedaouî_, \"man of the Desert\") has been\r\nbestowed on the nomades of Arabia, Egypt, and the Northern Sahara. The\r\nmajority of them are shepherds; a few add to this industry the much less\r\nhonourable occupation of plundering trade-caravans; some prefer to\r\ndevote themselves wholly to this pursuit. All the Bedouins are children\r\nof the sword. They exult in strife and the clash of arms. It is their\r\n_acmé_ of happiness to mount the war-steed and ride against the foe. The\r\ntheme of the Arab and his horse, of the attachment which subsists\r\nbetween them, of the services which the latter renders to his master, of\r\nhis physical and moral qualities, his courage, his swiftness, his\r\nfidelity, has been worn so threadbare that I need not here insist upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI must state, however, that as there are two varieties of Arab camels,\r\nso are there of Arab horses: the noble and the common, the beast of\r\nblood and the beast of burden. The former seem to be growing scarcer\r\nevery year. He is named _koleïl_. The nobility of a horse depends\r\nentirely upon that of his mother, so that an authentic certificate of\r\nbirth is always delivered to the purchaser of a \"high-bred steed.\" This\r\ncertificate is enclosed in a small bag, which also contains a mysterious\r\nwriting, and suspended to the animal's neck will be an omen of good\r\nfortune, it is hoped, to him and his owner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEDOUIN SHEPHERDS AND BEDOUIN NOMADES.]\r\n\r\nThe arms of the Bedouins are the curved sword, the yataghan, and the\r\nlong musket. Pistols are sometimes added, and the lance. They fight hand\r\nto hand, and without any strategical method. They never venture upon\r\nnight attacks. They seek to surprise the enemy by rapid marches and\r\nunexpected diversions, by ensnaring him in ambuscades, and harassing him\r\nwhen he is the strongest in numbers. The most trifling fortification,\r\nhowever, arrests them--a wall of brick, a simple ditch, a hedge of the\r\nfig-tree, will suffice to protect a village from their depredations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOUAREGS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTACK UPON A Q'SOUR.]\r\n\r\nThe nomades of the Southern Sahara have not, like the Bedouins,\r\npreserved in its purity the Shemitic type, but they have fostered and\r\ndeveloped the spirit of adventure and rapine which characterizes the\r\nArab of the desert, and they have added something of the ferocity of the\r\nstill barbarous tribes of Ham, with whom they have intermarried. These\r\nnomades form two principal groups--the Tibboos on the east, and Touaregs\r\n(Touarick, Touereug, or Tawarik) on the west. The former, according to\r\nHumboldt, are called \"birds,\" on account of their agility; they are\r\nstill imperfectly known to Europeans, despite of the labours of\r\nRichardson, Clapperton, and Barth. The second are divided into the\r\nTouaregs of Aghadez and the Touaregs of Tagazi. It was not until 1862\r\nthat the French army, crossing the Sahara from north to south, entered\r\ninto direct relations with these fierce children of the desert. In the\r\nsame year their ambassadors attracted the curiosity of ever-curious\r\nParis. They are the despots, the tyrants of the southern Sahara. The\r\ncharge of their lean flocks is their least occupation. They are, it is\r\ntrue, skilful and enthusiastic hunters; but their veritable industry is\r\nthe exploration of the desert: an exploration which changes in form\r\naccording to circumstances. For a proper remuneration they undertake the\r\nguidance and protection of the caravans; but whoever has not purchased\r\ntheir safeguard they treat as an enemy, and if not adequately ransomed\r\nsell into slavery. The Berbers of the oasis not unjustly regard these\r\nmarauders with alarm. For they pitilessly exact from the peaceful\r\ncultivator a share of his harvest, which is always the lion's share; the\r\nright of the strongest being the only right they recognize, and each\r\nman for himself the only principle they respect. A troop of Touaregs,\r\nfor instance, descends upon an oasis, and summons its inhabitants to\r\ndeliver up immediately a certain number of bags of dates. In case of\r\nrefusal they withdraw, but the people of the oasis may prepare to defend\r\nthemselves with arms, for the dreaded blow will very shortly be\r\ndelivered. The Touaregs, leaving their maharis and their baggage at a\r\nconvenient distance, penetrate at night into the palm-gardens, scale the\r\nwalls, and, unless very energetically repelled, seize upon the tribute\r\nthey had demanded.\r\n\r\nNothing is there to be remarked in the Arabs of the _q'sours_ but their\r\nmisery and degradation. A French officer, M. Tremblet, has described\r\nwith exactness and force their physiognomy, manners, character, ideas,\r\nand history.[78] One rises from the perusal of his book with a painful\r\nimpression. In the narrow and pestilential streets of the _q'sours_,\r\nwhere vermin are as numerous as men and women, in those mud palaces\r\nwhere the sultans are enthroned in rags, the same passions, the same\r\nambitions, the same all-potent appetites, the same struggles, intrigues,\r\nand crimes prevail, as occupy so large a place in the history of the\r\ngreat states of Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nAmong the inhabitants of the Desert I would include the possessors of\r\nthe great Egyptian oasis,--that ancient cradle of civilization--that\r\nstrange and mysterious land which, after throbbing with so full and\r\nbrilliant a life in the days of the Pharaohs and the Ptolemies,\r\nslumbered for centuries under the leaden domination of the Moslem. Let\r\nus note only that the Egyptian people have undergone no special\r\nmodification; the features of the fellahs of to-day are exactly those\r\nwhich we trace in the pictures that cover the walls of palace and tomb,\r\nthe monuments that carry us back in imagination to the erection of the\r\nPyramids or the glories of hundred-gated Thebes. It is the old\r\nEgypto-Berber race, wherein we recognize the mixture of the black and\r\nShemitic blood, or perhaps the still incomplete result of the\r\ninfluences which have transformed into negroes the whites who emigrated,\r\nsome thousands of years ago, from Western Asia into Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NUBIAN WOMEN.]\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians establish, very clearly, the transition between the\r\nShemites and the population of Nubia and Ethiopia. With the latter the\r\nskin is black or of a deep bronze; but the form, the features, the hair,\r\napproach much more nearly the Caucasian than the Negro type. The Nubian\r\nwomen especially exhibit a grace and dignity of movement which reveal\r\nthe nobleness of their origin. \"It is in these far lands,\" says Trémaux,\r\n\"we meet with the modern Rebecca, attired with the antique Biblical\r\nsimplicity, and carrying the water vessel on her head. Their air, at\r\nonce easy and reserved, their black modest eyes, recall those images of\r\nthe holy history which every one has seen; only, instead of a cotton\r\nstuff gaily coloured, imagine a piece very dirty and often in tatters,\r\nand you will have the portrait of the Nubian woman; this garment is\r\notherwise so naturally draped and so proudly worn, that it yields in\r\nnothing to the ancient models.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n_PRAIRIES, SAVANNAHS, PAMPAS, AND LLANOS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD PLAINS OF THE OLD WORLD:--THE AFRICAN INTERIOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we have crossed the 18th parallel (or nearly so) of north latitude\r\nin Africa and the 30th in Asia--the southern boundary of the Rainless\r\nDistrict--countries of extreme fertility and exuberant product succeed\r\nto the dreary solitudes we have hitherto traversed.\r\n\r\nAt intervals, indeed, the traveller encounters some vast blighted and\r\naccursed area, where, for a part of each year, a deadly aridity\r\nprevails; but ever there comes a happy moment, even in these desolate\r\nwastes, when genial Nature resumes her rights, abundant rains nourish\r\nvegetable and animal life, and the glowing scene constrains us to\r\nexclaim with thankful heart, \"The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic plains in the south, are, however, preserved from such\r\nabrupt alternations; numerous water-courses, leaping downward from the\r\nsnowy fountains of the Himalayan chain, refresh and fertilize these\r\ncountries, which are almost everywhere subject to the dominion of man.\r\nAnalagous causes, in the grand rich islands of the warm Indian seas,\r\nproduce similar effects; there, also, the very deserts are humid\r\nregions, and tall grasses, bushes, shrubs, reeds, and climbing plants\r\ngrow in a rank and luxuriant chaos which we designate by the name of\r\njungles, in whose dense obscurity the tiger makes his lair, and the\r\nserpent conceals his deadly venom!\r\n\r\nIn the immense triangle defined by that portion of the African continent\r\nwhich extends from the Mountains of the Moon to the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nnature has maintained almost intact her savage independence; but she\r\ndisplays there her most varied forms, from the snow-crested ice-bound\r\nmountain to the lowest and most monotonous plain, from the impenetrable\r\nforest to the nakedest and barrenest steppe.\r\n\r\nTo enable the reader to comprehend these widely different aspects, and\r\nto describe the peculiar characteristics of each region of this immense\r\ncontinent, it will be necessary for us to recapitulate its most\r\nimportant geographical features.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA vast plateau, of comparatively slight elevation, occupies all Southern\r\nAfrica, extending eastward as far as the fifth or sixth degree north of\r\nthe equator. To the north-west, it is bounded by the mountains of\r\nSenegambia; to the north-east, by those of Abyssinia. On the east and\r\nwest, the mountains descend to the very shore in secondary chains; to\r\nthe south the table-land is brought down to the sea in a series of\r\nterraces which separate the mountain-ranges.\r\n\r\nAt its southern extremity, the African continent is from 550 to 600\r\nmiles broad. It is occupied by the British colony of the Cape, which is\r\nbounded on the north by the Orange River. The most striking features of\r\nthe physical geography of this part of Africa, and which determine in\r\nthe main its climate and natural productions, are three chains of\r\nmountains disposed parallel to one another and to the southern coast.\r\nThese are separated by terraces or upland plains, each range forming the\r\nboundary of the lower and the abutment of the higher terrace. The\r\ncommunication is maintained by transverse valleys, which are often of a\r\nhighly romantic character. The loftiest and most inland chain is\r\nchristened in different parts of its course the Roggeveld Bergen, the\r\nNieuveld Bergen, and the Sneeu Bergen, or \"Snowy Mountains.\" Of these\r\nthe loftiest summit is the Compass Berg, 10,000 feet in altitude. The\r\nsecond chain, the Black Mountains, though not so lofty are more massive,\r\nand, in truth, composed of two or three chains in close juxtaposition.\r\nThe third, or last chain, in proceeding from south to north, varies from\r\neighteen to fifty-four miles, enlarging towards the west.\r\n\r\nThe plain or terrace between the Black and the Snowy Mountains is much\r\nloftier than the two other steps by which we descend to the southern\r\nextremity of the continent. The lowest terrace, bordering on the sea, is\r\nwell-watered and fertile. The second, or central terrace, consists of\r\nfertile districts, equally well watered, but intersected by vast dry\r\ndeserts, called (from a Hottentot word) _Karroos_. The third terrace,\r\ncommonly designated the Great Karroo, at the base of the Roggeveld and\r\nNieuveld chain, is 300 miles in length, 80 miles in breadth, and 2000\r\nfeet above the sea-level. Its soil, says a writer in the _Quarterly\r\nReview_, presents throughout its whole extent, for the greater portion\r\nof the year, not a trace of vegetation. These gloomy solitudes assume a\r\ncharacter of picturesque grandeur through their very wildness of\r\ndesolation. The scene might convey to a fanciful mind the dreary image\r\nof a ruined world, where the witches and demons of Goethe's\r\nWalpurgis-Night might fitly celebrate their revels.\r\n\r\n    \"And through the cliffs with ruin strewn,\r\n     The wild winds whizz, and howl, and moan.\"[79]\r\n\r\nDuring the long dry summer months, the smallest birds would not find\r\nwherewithal to sustain their existence in these sombre deserts, whose\r\nsolemn silence not even the murmur of an insect interrupts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIGHT-SCENE IN THE AFRICAN INTERIOR.]\r\n\r\nYet these regions, deprived of springs and running waters, are not\r\nalways sterile deserts, are not always desolate plains. In the dry\r\nseason, the soil, a yellow ferruginous clay, acquires the hardness of\r\nbrick, just as if it had been exposed to the fire of a furnace; but the\r\nroots and bulbs, protected by a ligneous covering, resist the devouring\r\nheat. The first rains revive them; they put forth their stems and\r\nbranches; a myriad flowers reveal their sparkling colours; and the\r\ncountry which, a day or two before, had shown to the eye a bare and\r\ndreary surface, shines out in a panoply of splendour, as if a magician's\r\nspell had suddenly transformed it into a terrestrial paradise! But as\r\nthe days lengthen, and the sun's power increases, the bloom and the\r\nbeauty vanish, and the curse of fire once more descends upon the gloomy\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nIn several districts north of the Cape Colony whole years pass by\r\nwithout the sight or sound of running water rejoicing the wistful\r\nwanderer. Dr. Livingstone, while residing among the Bakouans, in the\r\nBechuana country, saw the natives excavating the bed of the Kolobeng to\r\nextract a few drops of water. A centigrade thermometer, sunk two and a\r\nhalf inches in the earth, at noon, marked 56°. Insects placed on the\r\nsurface of the ground died in a few seconds. The grass was so dry that\r\nit crumbled into powder when plucked.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Natal is rich in trees and herbage. The Zambesi, and other\r\nrivers which descend from the central plateau, refresh the plains of\r\nMozambique and Zanzibar. But from the 4th parallel of north latitude to\r\nCape Guardafui extends an almost continuous desert. The southern\r\nextremity of the Lupata chain also presents a vast naked country, where\r\nthe presence of gold has encouraged the Portuguese to found some\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring zone of Kaffraria consists of great far-spreading,\r\ngently-undulating plains, characterized by extreme aridity. The western\r\ndistricts are much less broken than the central, and exhibit no\r\nundulations except in the vicinity of the ocean. There an immense level\r\nterritory exists under the name of the Kalihari Desert, whose southern\r\nboundary is marked by the Gariep or Orange River, which drains rather\r\nthan waters it. To the north this awful wilderness stretches as far as\r\nthe Lake Ngami, thus covering the area comprised between the 29th and\r\n30th parallels of south latitude. The pastoral country of Namaqua and\r\nDamaras bounds it on the west. Eastward it extends to the 24th meridian\r\nof west longitude.\r\n\r\nMoisture is not wholly wanting in this vast region. The Kalihari has\r\nbeen called a desert, says Livingstone,[80] because it contains no\r\nrunning water, and very little in wells. Far from being destitute of\r\nvegetation, it is covered with grass and creeping plants, and there are\r\nlarge patches of bushes, and even trees. It is remarkably flat; and\r\nprodigious herds of antelopes roam over its trackless plains. The soil\r\nis composed in general of a fine soft sand, lightly coloured--that is,\r\nof a nearly pure silica. In the ancient beds of dried-up rivers lie\r\nimmense patches of alluvial soil, which, hardened by the sun, form great\r\nreservoirs, retaining the rain-water for several months of the year. The\r\nquantity of grass flourishing in this region is remarkable. It grows\r\ngenerally in thick tufts, occasionally intermingled with spaces where\r\nthe earth is naked or closely overgrown with creeping plants. These,\r\ndeeply rooted in the soil, suffer but little from the effects of the\r\nexcessive heat. Most of them have tubercular roots, and are so organized\r\nas to furnish both food and liquid during the long droughts--an epoch\r\nwhen one vainly seeks elsewhere anything which can appease one's hunger\r\nor one's thirst.\r\n\r\nThe rich vegetation of the Kalihari is due to its geological\r\nconstitution. It consists of a great valley, or rather of a vast basin,\r\nwhose bottom is formed of a diluvial earth, and which is encircled by a\r\nbelt of rocks, cloven at several places. It follows that where the rain\r\nis abundant, the slope of the hills directs it towards the centre of the\r\nbasin, and this rain filters and deposits itself beneath the surface of\r\nthe soil. And it appears to be a proof of this statement, that on\r\ndigging in the sand cisterns are formed, or \"sucking-places,\" which are\r\nfilled with water supplied by subterraneous conduits.\r\n\r\nThis so-called Desert is not without its utility. Not only does it\r\nnourish innumerable multitudes of animals of every kind, but it has\r\nbecome the asylum of fugitive tribes. Here at first the Bakalabaris\r\nfound a refuge; and then, in their turn, other peoples of the Bechuana,\r\nwhose territories had been invaded by the Kaffirs.\r\n\r\nThe Kalihari has its mirage and its sirocco. During the excessive\r\ndrought which precedes the rainy season, a burning wind traverses this\r\ndesert from north to south, and during its three or four days' duration\r\nit withers and dries up everything in its path. It is so loaded with\r\nelectricity that a bundle of ostrich feathers, which remained exposed to\r\nit for a few seconds, was itself charged as if it had been in contact\r\nwith a powerful electrical machine, and produced a lively disturbance,\r\naccompanied by cracking noises, when taken in the hand. As often as this\r\nwind prevails, the electricity of the atmosphere is so abundant that\r\nevery movement of the natives causes sparks to be given off their\r\n_karosses_, or cloaks made of the skin of beasts.\r\n\r\nThe contrast is striking between the well-watered east coast of South\r\nAfrica and the arid western coast. After the scarped mountains of the\r\nCape, which ascend northward to the ocean, come the less lofty\r\nchains--the hills of sand which separate the interior sandy desert from\r\nthe equally sandy district of the littoral. With the exception of the\r\nWalvish Bay, the coast for eight hundred miles--from the great Orange\r\nRiver to Cape Negro--has not a stream of water.\r\n\r\nAt Cape Negro commences a series of terraces, separated from one another\r\nby long bands of sunken ground. This _ensemble_ describes a curve\r\ntowards the interior, and leaves on the coast a level plain of about 110\r\nmiles in breadth.\r\n\r\nIn Benguela the plains are healthy and cultivated. More to the north,\r\none encounters nothing but monotonous savannahs and forests with\r\ngigantic trees. The soil, at a great number of points, is saturated with\r\nwater, and, so to speak, enveloped in a shroud of pestilential vapour,\r\nwhich the breeze never scatters.\r\n\r\nThe low plains of Biafra and Benin, and especially the Delta of the\r\nNiger, are unwholesome, rank, and foul-smelling marshes. In their\r\nmangrove swamps lurks fever, and a legion of deadly diseases.\r\n\r\n        \"Macies et nova febrium\r\n    Terris incubuit cohors.\"--(_Horace._)\r\n\r\nUntil the early years of the present century very little was known of\r\nthe interior of Southern Africa. At this epoch some native merchants\r\ntraversed the country from one sea to another--from St. Paul de Loanda\r\nto the coast of Mozambique and Zanzibar. This exploit was repeated and\r\noutstripped by Dr. Livingstone, who, from 1850 to 1856, accomplished a\r\nmarvellous journey of six thousand miles, through regions never before\r\ntrodden by the white man's foot.\r\n\r\nSetting out from Kolobeng, the most advanced of the English missionary\r\nstations, he arrived, after having crossed some three hundred miles of a\r\nregion without water, at the beautiful river Zouga, which issues from\r\nthe western extremity of Lake Ngami.\r\n\r\n    \"A region of drought, where no river glides,\r\n     Nor rippling brook with osiered sides,\r\n     Nor sedgy pool, nor bubbling fount,\r\n     Nor tree, nor cloud, nor misty mount\r\n     Appears, to refresh the aching eye;\r\n     But barren earth, and the burning sky,\r\n      And the blank horizon round and round.\"[81]\r\n\r\nLake Ngami is from 45 to 60 miles long, and from 56 to 110 in\r\ncircumference. Its direction is N.N.E. to S.S.W. Its southern portion\r\ncurves westward, and it receives from the north-west the Teoughé. The\r\nwater, very fresh when the lake is full, grows brackish during the dry\r\nseason. At the latter period it is very shallow, and at eighteen or\r\ntwenty miles from the shore canoes can be manoeuvred with the help of\r\na pole. The banks are everywhere low. At the west a considerable space,\r\nutterly bare of trees, proves that the lake was formerly larger. During\r\nthe months which precede the arrival of the northern waters, cattle, to\r\nquench their thirst, make their way with difficulty through the belt of\r\nreeds dried up by the sun. The natives, says Livingstone, who reside on\r\nthe shores of the lake, tell us that trees and antelopes are carried\r\ndown by the waters during the annual inundation.\r\n\r\nThe same traveller informs us that the vast regions lying to the north\r\nof the lake at such great distances--regions copiously watered, and\r\ndeluged every year by the heavy tropical rains--pour towards the south\r\nthe excess of the waters which saturate their soil; and a certain\r\nquantity of these waters, encountering the lake on their way, flow into\r\nit. It is in March and April that the inundation begins. The waters, on\r\ndescending, find the rivers dried up, and the lake itself exceedingly\r\nshallow. The rivers in this part of Africa flow in channels capable of\r\ncontaining a far greater volume of water than they generally hold. When\r\nlooking at them, you might believe yourself in some desolated Oriental\r\ngarden where all the irrigating canals still exist, but where the dams\r\npermit only a mere thread of water to take its course.\r\n\r\n\"The water,\" adds Livingstone,[82] \"is less absorbed by the earth than\r\nlost between banks too wide apart, where the air and the sun evaporate\r\nthem. I am persuaded that there is not in the whole of this country a\r\nriver which loses itself amid the sands.\"\r\n\r\nThe country situated to the north is exceedingly level for some hundreds\r\nof miles, and abundantly provided with lakes and rivers, which the\r\nslightest undulations of the soil divert into innumerable windings. The\r\nplain is alternately covered with sombre thickets, lofty forests, and\r\ndense herbage. On the banks of some rivers this herbage assumes gigantic\r\nproportions, and by its tenacity opposes an effectual barrier to\r\nanimals. In many places the wide green pastures are enlivened by large\r\nherds of cattle, which the natives breed. The land of the Barotses\r\npossess immense prairies of this description, the home of numerous herds\r\nof elephants. But this richness of the soil is counterbalanced by the\r\ninsalubrity of the climate. These vast, periodically flooded surfaces\r\nbecome, when the waters recede, the nurseries of deadly fevers, and\r\nother formidable maladies, whose destructive influence extends to a\r\ngreat distance.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent river Zambesi, known in its upper course by the local\r\nappellation of Leambye--both words having the same signification in the\r\nnative tongue, \"the River\"--fertilizes and brightens these productive\r\nregions. Flowing at first from north to south, it makes a sharp bend\r\nwestward, to march with stately step from south to north, and from west\r\nto east, until, with a south-eastern inclination, it moves onward to the\r\nIndian Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was at a point nearly midway between the two oceans--the Indian and\r\nthe Atlantic--that the intrepid Livingstone first descried the Zambesi,\r\nregarding its fertile banks and noble stream with much the same emotions\r\nof delight and surprise as thrilled to the heart of Balboa, when\r\n\r\n              \"With eagle eyes\r\n    He stared at the Pacific--and all his men\r\n    Looked at each other with a wild surmise--\r\n        Silent,upon a peak in Darien.\"[83]\r\n\r\nHe arrived there near the close of the dry season, and yet a grand\r\nvolume of water still sparkled in the river's bed, which varied from 950\r\nto 1900 feet in breadth. At the epoch of the great floods, the Zambesi\r\nrises perpendicularly more than eighteen feet, and at certain points\r\nextends more than forty miles from its bank. From the borders of the\r\nChobé to those of the Zambesi spreads a low, level country, whose\r\nuniform expanse is only broken by the gigantic hillocks of the termites.\r\nAt intervals the traveller lights upon spots where the waters have\r\nformerly settled, then on great morasses and deep rivers, winding their\r\nslow way through an almost impervious jungle. There is a certain fatal\r\nbeauty about the whole region, like that of a Circe or a Lucrezia\r\nBorgia; but its atmosphere breathes disease and death.\r\n\r\nA general depression and flatness of surface seems to be the physical\r\ncharacteristic of this part of Central Africa. Thus, on the route\r\nadopted by Livingstone, in a N.N.E. direction, from the chain of\r\nBamunguatos to the Zambesi, all is level. Mount N'goua, an isolated mass\r\nin 18° 27' 20\" south latitude, and 24° 13' 63\" east longitude, is a\r\nwholly exceptional accident. The Kandehy Valley, which deploys on the\r\nnorthern slope of this narrow colossus, is one of the most picturesque\r\nscenes that greeted the eyes of Livingstone during his adventurous\r\npilgrimage. Fruit trees, loaded with emerald foliage, adorn its sides;\r\na crystal brook ripples in the centre. Under the shade of an enormous\r\nbaobab the graceful antelopes browse undisturbed, until alarmed by the\r\nfootfall of the approaching traveller. Gnus and zebras contemplate the\r\nstrange intruder with an air of surprise. A few continue to crop the\r\ngrass indifferent; others pause in the banquet, uncertain whether to\r\nstay or take to flight. The huge hulk of a white rhinoceros drags\r\nlabouring up the shady valley. Buffaloes, and condors, and giraffes\r\nstray far into its pleasant depths as peaceful and almost as trustful as\r\nthose of their race which, in days remote, wandered among the beauties\r\nof Eden, in\r\n\r\n            \"That delicious grove,\r\n    That garden, planted with the trees of God.\"\r\n\r\nFurther to the north, even to the river Sanshureh, the country increases\r\nin richness and beauty, the water-courses multiply, and the herbage\r\naspires to such a height that vehicles and animals are lost amongst it.\r\n\r\nAn exceeding gentleness, an almost Arcadian calm, characterizes the\r\nlandscape on the banks of the Leeba, a great affluent of the Leambye.\r\nThis river drags its slow and ever-winding waters through a delightful\r\nmeadow-land, which is probably flooded every year, for there is no wood\r\nexcept where the ground rises four or five feet above the general level\r\nof the plain. The soil of these tree-crowned plateaux, or knolls, is\r\nsandy, while that of the prairies consists of an alluvial earth, gray\r\nand black, and mixed with numerous river-shells.\r\n\r\nAscending the Leeba, we enter on a plain more than eighteen miles in\r\nbreadth, where the water rises to the traveller's ankles. This water,\r\nsays Livingstone, does not proceed from the overflow of the river; but\r\nthe level of the ground is so horizontal that the rain-water cannot pass\r\naway, and abides there for months. Still more humid are the adjacent\r\nplains of Lobala. This vast submerged area forms a watershed between the\r\nrivers of the north and those of the south. Up to this point all the\r\nrivers wend their way southward; but from this point they adopt a\r\nnortherly course, to empty their tribute into the Kasaï or Loké.\r\n\r\nThe interior table-land, especially towards the mid-course of the\r\nZambesi, is intersected by lofty mountain-chains. It is in this region,\r\nand at the southernmost point of the river's great Delta, which is 270\r\nmiles in length, that the famous Falls occur, named by the natives\r\n\"Mosioatounya,\" or \"Smoke-resounding,\" re-christened by Livingstone, the\r\nVictoria. Their vast columns of vapour are visible at a distance of five\r\nor six miles, and might suggest to an American traveller the rolling\r\nclouds that ascend from a burning prairie. The banks and islands of the\r\nriver are here enriched with sylvan vegetation of every variety of form\r\nand colour: the mighty baobab, each of whose enormous arms would form\r\nthe trunk of a large tree; the graceful palm, with its crest of\r\nplume-like foliage; the silvery mohonams, whose leaves sparkle in the\r\nsunshine like Achilles' shield; and the nutsouri, abounding in clusters\r\nof pleasant scarlet fruit.\r\n\r\nThe Falls are bounded on three sides by densely-wooded ridges 300 or 400\r\nfeet in height, and may be likened to a flood of water a thousand yards\r\nbroad, suddenly hurled over a basaltic precipice 100 feet in depth, and\r\nthen as suddenly compressed into a narrow gully not more than fifteen or\r\ntwenty yards across.\r\n\r\n\"If one imagines,\" says Dr. Livingstone,[84] \"the Thames filled with low\r\ntree-covered hills immediately below the Tunnel, extending as far as\r\nGravesend, the bed of black basaltic rock instead of London mud, and a\r\nfissure made therein from one end of the Tunnel to the other, down\r\nthrough the keystones of the arch, and prolonged from the left end of\r\nthe Tunnel through thirty miles of hills; then fancy the Thames leaping\r\nbodily into the gulf, and forced there to change its direction and flow\r\nfrom the right to the left bank, and then rush boiling and roaring\r\nthrough the hills, he may have some idea of what takes place at this the\r\nmost wonderful sight I have witnessed in Africa.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICTORIA FALLS, RIVER ZAMBESI.]\r\n\r\nIn descending into the narrow abyss already spoken of, the cataract\r\nbreaks into five separate streams, which send up, to an elevation of 200\r\nor 300 feet, as many columns of luminous vapour--pillars of shivering\r\nspray, and foam, and diamond sparkle, which in the sunlight are\r\ngloriously wreathed with the rare hues of Iris.\r\n\r\n                      \"How profound\r\n    The gulf! and how the giant element\r\n    From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,\r\n    Crushing the cliffs, which, downward worn and rent\r\n    With his fierce footsteps, yield in chasms a vent\r\n    To the broad column which rolls on.\"--(_Byron._)\r\n\r\nIn descending the Zambesi, we encounter the great river Kafue, which\r\nflows from the north. Beyond the point of confluence the country becomes\r\nopener, freer, and healthier, and we arrive at the Portuguese town of\r\nTété.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 miles to the north-west of Tété lies the great lake of fresh\r\nwater, Niyanyizi-Nyassa, or \"Lake of Stars,\" which stretches far away to\r\nthe north-west across Unyamuezi, or \"The Land of the Moon.\" It is rather\r\nshallow, sprinkled with numerous fairy islands, and seems to be the\r\nremains of an ancient lake of much greater extent. To the south-west a\r\nbelt of fertile country separates it from another lake called Shirwa,\r\nwhence issues a beautiful river, tributary to the Zambesi, impeded in\r\nits course by numerous rapids, but traversing a level and unwholesome\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAt the same time (1856-58) that Livingstone accomplished these great\r\ndiscoveries, Equatorial Africa was penetrated from the coast of Zambesi\r\nby Captains Burton and Speke. These undaunted and indefatigable\r\ntravellers, after having ascended the river Pangany for a hundred and\r\nthirty miles, through a rich and cultivated but pestiferous plain,\r\narrived in February 1858 at Lake Tanganyika, of which the natives had\r\nspoken to Livingstone, describing the country lying to the westward of\r\nthat mass of water as bare of wood, and solely covered with marshy\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nLake Tanganyika lies 200 miles S.W. of the Victoria N'yanza, between\r\nlat. 3° and 7° 45' S., at an elevation of 1844 feet above the sea. The\r\n30th meridian of east longitude strikes it in the centre. Its length is\r\n320 miles; but its breadth seldom exceeds 15 or 20, and never 60 miles,\r\nso that it has been compared to a beach inclining its head towards the\r\nnorth. To the north-east its shores are bold and elevated; the water is\r\nfresh and deep. The country around it is rich in pasture, where a\r\nthriving population breed numerous flocks and herds.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred miles to the north-east of this lake, and 3740 feet\r\nabove the sea-level, lies the vast basin of the Victoria N'yanza,\r\ndiscovered by Captain Speke in 1859, and more fully explored by Speke\r\nand Grant in 1862. Its northern shore runs nearly parallel to the\r\nEquator, at a distance of about twenty miles from it; its southern is in\r\nlat. 2° 46' S., and long. 33° E. It would seem at some remote period to\r\nhave occupied a much larger area than it does at present, though even\r\nnow it is supposed to measure 220 miles in length and fully as much in\r\nbreadth. Speke describes it as very shallow. Fleets of canoes cover its\r\nsurface; but the natives on the one shore never venture across to the\r\nother, and no intercommunication has ever existed between them. The\r\nsurrounding landscapes are of a pastoral character, genial and fertile,\r\nwith quiet breadths of rich meadow land, dotted by hundreds of white\r\nhornless cattle, and scarcely distinguishable from our midland English\r\nscenery, were they not interspersed with groves of the banana, the\r\ncoffee-tree, and the date-palm. At its north-eastern extremity, and\r\nprobably connected with it, lies a long narrow basin which the natives\r\ncall Lake Baringo. On the west it receives the tributary waters of the\r\nKitangulé, and from the north throws off the various streams which unite\r\nin one channel to form the famous Nile.\r\n\r\nNorth-west from the N'yanza lies the little Lúta N'zigé, or Albert Lake,\r\ndiscovered by Sir Samuel Baker in 1864; a long, narrow, and shallow\r\nbasin, surrounded by mountains 7000 feet high, about 230 miles in\r\nlength, and 2488 feet above the sea-level, which apparently serves as\r\nthe great reservoir of the Nile.[85]\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Livingstone, Burton, Speke, Grant, and Baker, seem to\r\nconfirm the theory put forward by Sir Roderick Murchison, that the\r\ncentral portion of South Africa is a large and elevated basin, abounding\r\nin immense plains, in fertile lands, besprinkled with numerous lakes fed\r\nby a thousand currents descending from the lofty mountains that\r\nsurrounded it. The rains, says Morin, cause these lakes to overflow, and\r\ntheir waters, prevailing over every obstacle, break through the barrier\r\nof the high lands, and descend into the lower levels in a series of\r\ncataracts, to make their way eventually towards the ocean. Livingstone\r\nhas proved the truth of this felicitous induction as far as the Zambesi\r\nis concerned. The Nile also issues from the lofty table-lands through\r\ndeep and rocky ravines. The great reservoir of the mysterious Egyptian\r\nriver, the _N'yanza Spekii_, may be accepted as the final confirmation\r\nof Sir Roderick's theory, and the conspicuous feature of the African\r\npeople. The southern extremity of this lake stretches as far as the\r\nwatershed between North and South Africa. Starting from the same\r\nviewpoint, Speke concludes that another great lake will be found under\r\nthe Equator, to the west of the Tanganyika and the N'yanza Victoria.\r\nThis will be the reservoir of the Congo. To establish this fact will be\r\nto solve the last problem of the hydrographic system of Africa.[86]\r\n\r\nThe western region of the African equatorial zone has been but\r\nsuperficially explored, and in this direction numerous hypotheses remain\r\nto be verified. Lake Tchad, situated in Central Nigritia, between Bornou\r\non the west and the south-west, and the Kanem to the north and east, was\r\ndiscovered in 1823 by Major Denham, and explored by Dr. Barth in 1852.\r\nThe latter traveller grows eloquent in his description of the delicious\r\nperspective which he had supposed it would offer to the gaze. He met\r\nwith numerous slaves on their way to cut grass for the horses. But\r\ninstead of a lake, an immense treeless plain stretched as far as the eye\r\ncould reach. The herbage became fresher and greener, thicker and taller;\r\na marshy bottom, describing a curve which projected here and receded\r\nthere, embarrassed his progress more and more; and after a useless and\r\nprolonged struggle to escape from the quagmire, seeking in vain on the\r\nhorizon some mirror-like surface, he retraced his steps, dabbling in the\r\nslimy water, and consoling himself with the reflection that at least he\r\nhad seen some traces of the \"liquid element.\" But the scene was\r\nstrangely different when, in the winter of 1854-55, more than one-half\r\nof the Ngornou was destroyed by the inundation; and to the south of that\r\ntown lay a deep sea, swallowing up the whole plain even to the village\r\nof Koukiya! The lower stratum of the soil, composed of limestone,\r\nappeared to have given way in the preceding year, and had lowered the\r\nshore of the lake several yards; hence the inundation. But apart from\r\nthis evidently exceptional geological catastrophe, the character of the\r\nTchad is clearly that of an immense lagoon whose borders change every\r\nmonth, and of which it is consequently impossible to lay down any\r\nstrictly accurate map.[87]\r\n\r\nLake Tchad lies between lat. 12° 30' and 14° 30' N., long. 13° and 15°\r\n30' S. Its length varies from two hundred to three hundred miles,\r\naccording to the amount of rainfall and similar circumstances; at its\r\nbroadest it measures one hundred and seventy miles; and it has an\r\nelevation of eight hundred feet above the sea-level. The actual margin\r\nof its waters is lined by a deep fence of papyrus and tall reeds, from\r\nten to fourteen feet high. Its islands are densely peopled. Fish and\r\nwater-fowl abound, and not less do crocodiles and hippopotami. The lake\r\nhas no outlet, but receives several rivers, of which the Waube and the\r\nShari are the most notable.\r\n\r\nThe country watered by the Niger is also broken up by vast plains which,\r\nfertile and glowing in the rainy season, are scorched and withered by\r\nthe summer heats. The famous port of Kabara, not far from Timbuktù, is\r\nseveral miles from the river, and only accessible for five months in the\r\nyear at the epoch of the great rains.\r\n\r\nBeyond this belt of vegetation, this girdle of fertility, Nature wears a\r\nsombre aspect--the stony look of a corpse; for the immense Desert of the\r\nSahara begins. The transition from the one region to the other, from\r\nthe land of plenty to the land of want and famine, from the land of\r\nbright lakes, and copious streams, and green pastures, to the land of\r\nrocky heights and barren sandy wastes, is as startling as the change\r\nwhich sometimes occurs in human life--the change of a moment, from\r\nbustling and exuberant happiness to profound sorrow. It is such\r\ncontrasts, however, that enable us fully to appreciate the beauty and\r\nwealth of Nature.\r\n\r\n    \"The scorching winds from arid deserts borne,\"\r\n\r\nteach us to prize the balmy breath of the \"sweet south\" that wanders\r\n\"o'er a bank of violets.\" Fresh from the dreary Sahara plain, burnt and\r\nscathed by a Tropic sun, we can feel all the loveliness of the woodland\r\nand the leafy vale, of each\r\n\r\n                      \"Melodious plot\r\n    Of beechen green, and shadows numberless.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in the material world as in the moral and intellectual, the law of\r\ncompensation prevails, and the wayfarer in the Desert of Life may cheer\r\nhimself with the recollection that in due time the silence will be\r\nsucceeded by music, the desolation by beauty, and the wilderness by\r\n\r\n    \"Verdurous glooms, and winding mossy ways.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDESERTS OF THE NEW WORLD:--PRAIRIES, PAMPAS, LLANOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey who study the philosophy of history, of which men talk so much, and\r\nknow so little; they who seek in the general laws of nature and the\r\nphysical economy of the globe an explanation of its ethnological\r\nphenomena, may find, it seems to me, a curious subject for investigation\r\nin the singular destiny of the New World. They will have to ascertain by\r\nwhat concurrence of circumstances the two Americas, separated from us\r\nby an immensity of waters, and revealed to the world of the East but\r\nsome four centuries ago, shall have traversed in so brief a period the\r\nsuccessive phases of conquest, colonization, and emancipation; why\r\nEuropean emigration was directed thitherward at the very beginning; and\r\nthitherward continues still to flow from every quarter; finally, by what\r\ntacit and unanimous agreement this New World has become the adopted\r\ncountry of all the proscribed and disinherited of the Old; while almost\r\nthe entire area of the African continent, which is so much more readily\r\naccessible, is scarcely less favoured in its climatic conditions, and\r\nupon which the white race has rested, from the remotest antiquity, its\r\npolitical institutions, its arts, and its industry, has remained\r\nuninfluenced by the advancing tide of civilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRAIRIES OF NORTH AMERICA--STAMPEDO OF WILD BISONS.]\r\n\r\nI limit myself to indicating this problem, which, however, it is not\r\nwithin my present province to examine, but which naturally suggests\r\nitself when we think of the swift development undergone by the European\r\nsocieties planted on the American continent--when we remember how\r\nrapidly they are narrowing the area of the desert and the wilderness. At\r\nthe epoch of the discovery of the New World it was one vast desolation,\r\nwith the exception of Mexico and Peru; and these were but the seats of a\r\ncivilization which seemed to have passed without transition from infancy\r\nto old age, from vigour to decrepitude, and which crumbled into dust\r\nunder the pitiless blows of the Spanish conquerors. Neither Cortez nor\r\nPizarro would have overthrown a great empire with a handful of\r\nfoot-soldiers and men-at-arms, a squadron or two of horse, and a few\r\nunwieldy guns, had not the Colossus already nodded to its fall, had not\r\nthe Column been hollow at the base. But soon the European nations shared\r\namong themselves this immense country and the neighbouring islands. The\r\nSlave race, whose destiny it seemed to be to reign among the polar ice\r\nand snow, long contented itself with the inclement and inhospitable\r\nregion of the extreme north-west, which it has but recently surrendered\r\nto the United States Government. The Anglo-Saxon race, in the northern\r\ncontinent, has seized the lion's share. It now holds between the two\r\noceans, from the fifty-fifth to the thirtieth parallels of north\r\nlatitude, a fertile and life-breathing territory, well fitted to be the\r\ncradle of great empires; the flourishing Confederation of Canada, the\r\ncolony of British Columbia, and the mighty republic of the United\r\nStates. Virgin forests have fallen before the restless axe of the hardy\r\npioneer; hundreds of populous cities have risen as if by enchantment in\r\ndistricts haunted within the memory of men by the bear and the wild\r\nbuffalo; a network of railways spreads from the Atlantic almost to the\r\nbase of the Rocky Mountains; crops of waving corn bloom over wide\r\nprairies that a few years ago yielded only the tall grass and waving\r\nreed; the aboriginal tribes of the Red Indians have melted away before\r\nthe impetuous tide of an ever-advancing civilization; and the\r\nexhaustless energies of our race have already raised in less than a\r\ncentury two mighty empires on the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence,\r\ndestined to a marvellous, a changeful, and doubtlessly a glorious\r\nhistory. And both these empires have sprung from the loins of England,\r\nare governed in the main by the same laws, hold the same religion, are\r\nanimated by the same aspiring and unwearied genius, and\r\n\r\n                    \"Speak the tongue\r\n    That Shakspeare spoke; the faith and morals hold\r\n    Which Milton held;\"\r\n\r\nin everything, as we believe,\r\n\r\n                                \"Are sprung\r\n    Of Earth's first blood, have titles manifold.\"[88]\r\n\r\nSouthward from the thirtieth parallel stretches the domain of the Latin\r\nraces, already mingled with and being absorbed by the Anglo-Saxon, in\r\nCanada, California, and the Southern States of the Union. Vast as this\r\nregion is, for it comprehends all Central America and all the Southern\r\nContinent, it is infinitely less prosperous, less powerful, less\r\npeopled, than what we may call Saxon America. Mexico is a byword and a\r\nreproach for savage anarchy and murderous license. Neither Chili, nor\r\nPeru, nor even Brazil approaches Canada in solid power and the\r\nauspicious promise of future greatness. The Latin race seems dwarfed\r\nand cowed by the neighbourhood of the energetic Anglo-Saxon, is swiftly\r\nretiring before it in North America, and in the course of centuries will\r\nprobably be subjugated by it, even in the southern division of the great\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of South America, however, is uncultivated,\r\nunpeopled, and but imperfectly explored. There the Desert re-appears\r\nwith--\r\n\r\n    \"The pale, cold aspect of a wearied friend,\"[89]\r\n\r\nunder its most sharply defined forms and most impressive conditions. The\r\nsupremacy of the whites over the indigenous tribes is almost nominal;\r\nand if the latter are gradually dying out, the catastrophe, in this\r\ninstance, is due rather to their own lack of vigour, energy, and\r\ncapacity, than to the pressure of civilization.\r\n\r\nHowever rapid may be the growth of population in North America, however\r\ngreat the rapidity--shall we say the avidity?--of the American\r\n_squatters_ in their conquest and appropriation of the soil, the Desert\r\nstill occupies, principally in \"the far West\" and the North--that is to\r\nsay, in the angle comprised between the line of the great lakes and the\r\nRocky Mountains--an area almost equal to the whole of Continental\r\nEurope. There we find, as Mr. Johnstone points out, the largest plains\r\nin the world. One such, for example, is that immense basin which extends\r\nfrom the mouths of the Mackenzie, in the icy Arctic Sea, even to the\r\nremote Delta of the Mississippi, and from the huge chain of the Rocky\r\nMountains, with their piny recesses and snowy peaks, to the less rugged\r\nand more pastoral range of the Alleghanies; a total area of\r\n4,400,000,000 square yards (3,245,000 square miles). A table-land of\r\ngentle elevation, nowhere above 1500 feet, and rarely more than 700 feet\r\nhigh, separates this territory into two secondary basins.\r\n\r\nThe _north-east_, which pours its waters into the Arctic Ocean, Hudson's\r\nBay, and through the Canadian lakes and River St. Lawrence, into the\r\nAtlantic; and,\r\n\r\nThe _south_ basin, of the Missouri-Mississippi, whose mighty waters flow\r\ninto the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt is in the latter that the traveller encounters the great grassy\r\nplains of the _Prairies_ or _Savannahs_ which are so remarkable a\r\nfeature of North America, and which chiefly lie along the western bank\r\nof the Mississippi. \"There are no prairies,\" says Sir J. Richardson, \"to\r\nthe north of Peace River, and the level lands which border the Rocky\r\nMountains do not extend beyond the Great Salt Lake.\"\r\n\r\nUnder so wide a range of latitude the plain necessarily embraces a great\r\nvariety of soil, climate, and productions; but being almost in a state\r\nof nature, it is characterized in its central and southern parts by\r\ninterminable grassy savannahs and enormous forests, and in the far north\r\nby deserts not less dreary than those of Siberia.[90]\r\n\r\nSouthward, a bare sandy waste, 400 or 500 miles wide, skirts the base of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains to the forty-first parallel of north latitude. The\r\ndry plains of Texas and the upper region of the Arkansas have all the\r\nfeatures of Asiatic table-lands; further to the north, the lifeless,\r\ntreeless steppes on the high grounds of the far West are burnt up in\r\nsummer, and frozen in winter by biting blasts from the Rocky Mountains.\r\nTowards the Mississippi the soil improves, but its delta is a labyrinth\r\nof streams, and lakes, and dense brushwood, and the rank marshes at its\r\nmouth cover an area of 35,000 square miles. \"There are also,\" says Mrs.\r\nSomerville, \"large tracts or forest and saline ground, especially the\r\nGrand Saline between the rivers Arkansas and Neseikelongo, which is\r\noften covered two or three inches deep with salt, like a fall of snow.\r\nAll the cultivation on the right bank of the river is along the Gulf of\r\nMexico and in the adjacent provinces, and is entirely tropical,\r\nconsisting of sugar-cane, cotton, and indigo. The prairies, so\r\ncharacteristic of North America, then begin.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what are these prairies?\r\n\r\nLeagues upon leagues of rolling meadow-land, sometimes as level as an\r\nEnglish pasture, always as boundless, apparently, as the sea; richly\r\ncovered with long rank grass of tender green, and lighted up by flowers\r\nof the liliaceous kind which scent the air with fragrance. Here and\r\nthere, in the north, occur clumps of oak and black walnut; in the south,\r\ngroups of tulip, and cotton, and magnolia trees. Occasionally the\r\nmonotonous scene is relieved by a lazy brook, whose banks bloom with a\r\nbrilliant mass of azaleas, kalmias, rhododendrons, and andromedas; the\r\nlow howl of the cayeute, or prairie dog, breaks the silence; and life is\r\ngiven to the landscape by the frequent appearance of herds of bison,\r\ndeer, and wild horses. At times, in the remote districts, the prairie\r\nwolves will be seen in some leafy covert awaiting the approach of a\r\nvictim; or flights of birds darken the air, and tempt the traveller with\r\nthe promise of an abundant provision.\r\n\r\nOn the right bank of the Missouri, and on the borders of the White\r\nRiver, in the territory of Nebraska, lies a dreary desert valley, some\r\n30 feet deep, which the French expressively designate les\r\n_Mauvaises-Terres_. It may be doubted whether the whole world offers a\r\nstranger or a more impressive landscape. Here geology recognizes the\r\nvestiges of an astonishing diluvian labour, and it is impossible to\r\nventure a step without striking one's foot against the fossil relics of\r\nvanished animals.\r\n\r\nIt is a kind of world apart, says an American writer; a large valley\r\nwhich seems to have been excavated, in the first place, by an immense\r\nvertical out-throw, and then modelled by the prolonged and incessant\r\naction of denudating agents. With a mean breadth of 28, and a total\r\nlength of 90 miles, it develops itself in a westerly direction, at the\r\nfoot of the sombre mountain-chain known as the _Black Hills_. On issuing\r\nfrom the immense, uniform, and monotonous prairie, the traveller finds\r\nhimself suddenly transported, after a descent of 100 to 200 feet, into a\r\ndepression of the soil where rise a myriad of abrupt rocks, irregular or\r\nprismatic, or like columns dressed with enormous pyramids, and from 110\r\nto 220 feet in height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF THE \"MAUVAISES-TERRES,\" NEBRASKA, U.S.]\r\n\r\nThese natural towers are so multiplied over the surface of this\r\nextraordinary region, that the roads wind through them in narrow\r\npassages, and the labyrinth may be likened to the irregular streets and\r\nnarrow alleys of some mediæval European city. Seen from afar, the\r\ninterminable succession of rocks resembles the massive monuments of\r\nantiquity; nor are turrets wanting, nor flying buttresses, nor graceful\r\narches, nor vaulted portals, groups of columns, façades, and taper\r\nspires. If at one place the eye lights upon the ruins of a feudal\r\nfortress, at another it surveys the graceful ensemble of a Saracenic\r\nmosque. Or you might almost say, in the distance, that it is a fantastic\r\n\"city of the dead\" which looms before you; or the gigantic palace of a\r\nrace of unseen beings, fashioned by the power of spell and enchantment.\r\nAnd if the illusion vanishes when, descending from the heights, you\r\npenetrate into the mazes of this Dædalian marvel, the reality is not\r\nless calculated to inspire you with astonishment, and the imagination\r\nremains confused before this wild, this grand, yet ominous freak of\r\nNature--ominous, for the place seems like a colossal Golgotha, and the\r\nrocks may be the monuments consecrated by invisible hands to the things\r\nand creatures, the life and majesty, of a forgotten Past!\r\n\r\nA spectacle unexpected by the European traveller comes at intervals to\r\nheighten and confirm the illusion. Here and there are reared\r\nconstructions of manifest human work, but of a truly primitive\r\ncharacter. They consist of four poles, supporting a rude platform of\r\nwicker. Mount any adjacent hillock, and you will see corpses and human\r\nskeletons outstretched upon the platform. These constructions are, in\r\ntruth, the burial-places of the Sioux Indians, who wander still in the\r\nneighbouring districts.\r\n\r\nThe whole coast of the Mexican Gulf, from the Pearl River eastward,\r\nthrough Alabama and a great part of Florida, is occupied by the\r\nso-called \"pine barrens,\" which extend far into the interior. These\r\n\"vast monotonous tracts of sand, covered with forests of gigantic pine\r\ntrees,\" are not less a characteristic feature of North America than the\r\n\"rolling prairies.\" They are not limited to this part of the United\r\nStates, but occur to a great extent in Virginia, North Carolina, and\r\nelsewhere. Tennessee and Kentucky, though the plough has passed over\r\nextensive areas, still possess large forests, and the Ohio flows for\r\nhundreds of miles among patriarchal trees, with a rich undergrowth of\r\nazaleas, rhododendrons, and other beautiful shrubs, bound together in\r\nchains of flowers by creeping plants. When America was discovered, one\r\nmass of unbroken forest spread over the mainland, from the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence and the Canadian Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the\r\nAtlantic Ocean it crossed the Alleghany Mountains, and spread in gloom\r\nand grandeur over the valley of the Mississippi--an ocean of vegetation\r\nswelling and sinking for upwards of one million of square miles.\r\n\r\n     \"Then all the broad and boundless mainland lay,\r\n      Cooled by the interminable wood, that frowned\r\n      O'er mound and vale, where never summer ray\r\n      Glanced, till the strong tornado broke his way\r\n      Through the gray giants of the sylvan wild;\r\n      Yet many a sheltered glade, with blossoms gay,\r\n      Beneath the showery sky and sunshine mild,\r\n    Within the shaggy arms of that dark forest smiled.\"[91]\r\n\r\nPrairies which, in their general aspect, resemble those of the Missouri\r\nand the Mississippi, are found to the east and west of the American\r\nDesert, in Arrisona, in Texas, in California, and various provinces of\r\nMexico. Vegetation, however, nevertheless differs according to the\r\nconditions of each region, and the alternatives of deluging rains and\r\nextreme dryness become more and more conspicuous as we approach the\r\nEquator. Nevertheless--and this, perhaps, is the feature most\r\ndistinctive of the Prairies, or Savannahs, from the Pampas and\r\nLlanos--the dryness is never sufficiently severe in the former to\r\ndestroy vegetation, as is the case in the latter. But the herbs and\r\ngrasses often grow so dry in summer that the most trivial accident--such\r\nas a lighted match flung carelessly away, or the ashes dropped from a\r\nhunter's pipe--will kindle the most awful conflagrations, and the flames\r\nwill spread devouringly over leagues of open ground, consuming trees and\r\nshrubs, and burning to death the cattle or wild animals which haply fall\r\nwithin their range. With the crackling, hissing, seething noises of the\r\nfire mingle the groans of the perishing beasts, while huge clouds of\r\nsmoke roll before the wind, like the billows of a wind-swept ocean,\r\nand live tongues of flame ever and anon light up the terrible scene with\r\nlurid splendour. These \"Prairie-fires\" are sometimes kindled in revenge\r\nby the Indians, and occasionally the settlers resort to this dangerous\r\nbut summary method of clearing the encumbered ground. However caused,\r\nthe spectacle is one of infinite grandeur, which might have furnished\r\nDante with a fresh image of horror for his \"Inferno.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRAIRIE ON FIRE IN CENTRAL AMERICA.]\r\n\r\nFrom the fortieth to the thirty-fifth parallels of north latitude the\r\nDesert appears in North America under a form more like the \"seas of\r\nsand\" of Africa and Arabia; the vast areas of the _Llanos_ and the\r\n_Pampas_. These two words are nearly synonymous. They are used to\r\ndesignate wide level plains, inundated and fertile in the rainy season,\r\nbut in the hot season stripped by the sun's rays of every apparent trace\r\nof vegetation. Between the Californian Alps and the Rio-Colorado withers\r\na grand, sandy, and utterly barren plain, which touches the northern\r\nborders of La Sonora. Somewhat further to the east extends the\r\nLlano-Estacado, which eventually merges into the American Desert. But\r\nthe most considerable Pampas and Llanos belong to South America. Of\r\nthese, the most arid and the most desolate--which most vividly recall\r\nthe rainless deserts of the Old World--are the Pampa of Atacama, between\r\nthe Andes and the Pacific, with Taracapa on the north, and Copiapo on\r\nthe south; that of Sechura, which forms a great portion of the littoral\r\nof the Peruvian department of Truxillo; and that of Pernambuco, which\r\nforms the major part of the plateau north-east of Brazil.\r\n\r\nThese Deserts, no less than those of Africa and Arabia, merit the name\r\nof the \"Land of Fear.\"\r\n\r\nTheir surface is as smooth as that of the calm sea, and bounded only by\r\nthe circular line of the horizon; the eye frequently ranges over a space\r\nof twenty-five square miles without meeting a clump of trees on which to\r\nrest; nor is the monotony relieved by the slightest undulation of the\r\nsoil. Everywhere is nothingness, silence, desolation, death. More than\r\none wayfarer has never escaped from their mazy solitudes. Fatigue,\r\nhunger, thirst, decimate the caravans which undertake to traverse them,\r\nand the track is marked by whitened skeletons, whose flesh has been\r\ndevoured by vultures, and which unknown hands have piled up and arranged\r\nwith a ghastly symmetry of order.\r\n\r\nHowever, since the discovery of America, certain portions of the Llanos\r\nhave become habitable. Towns have risen at intervals on the banks of the\r\nrivers which water them. These centres of population are connected with\r\neach other by huts of reeds, covered with ox-hides, and separated by\r\nabout a day's march. Here reside the _Llaneros_, to whose charge are\r\nintrusted the innumerable herds of cattle, horses, and mules, which\r\nsubsist on the pasturage of the Steppes.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Llanos possess characteristics as marked as those\r\nof their plains. The _hatos_ wherein they assemble are situated at long\r\ndistances apart; but the true home of the llanero, a bold and skilful\r\nhorseman, is his saddle. Firmly seated on his rapid steed, he gallops at\r\nwill across the trackless plain, and combining the two extremes of\r\nsolitude and activity, confines his half-savage existence to the custody\r\nor the ownership of his herds of horses and cattle. Thus, born in the\r\nLlanos like his father, a descendant of the first Spanish settlers, he\r\nhas no idea of any other country than his southern pastures, of any\r\nother career than his dreamy pastoral life. Clothed in a picturesque\r\ncostume, half Spanish, half Indian; his _machete_ (or cutlass) thrust\r\nthrough a belt of leather, his _poncho_ (a chequered mantle) over his\r\nshoulder, and the redoubtable _lasso_ suspended in a coil to his\r\nsaddle-bow; armed with the clumsy lance, which serves to drive his herd\r\nbefore him, and, at need, to vindicate its owner's courage in some\r\npartisan affray; the llanero, never thinking of the past, never dreaming\r\nof the future, on the alert in every danger, and accustomed to the\r\nseverest privations, enjoys with intoxication the rude happiness of his\r\nwild freedom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAMPAS OF SOUTH AMERICA.]\r\n\r\nThe Llanos of Venezuela occupy a superficial area, estimated, according\r\nto Humboldt, at 153,000 square miles, between the deltas of the Orinoco\r\nand the river Coqueta. They are as flat as the surface of the sea, and\r\ncovered with long rank grass. You might travel over the dreary level for\r\n1100 miles from the delta of the Orinoco to the foot of the Andes of\r\nPasto, and frequently not encounter an eminence a foot high in 270\r\nsquare miles. Their length is twice that of their breadth; and as the\r\nwind blows constantly from the east, the climate is the more ardent the\r\nfurther west. \"These Steppes, for the most part,\" says Mrs.\r\nSomerville,[92] \"are destitute of trees or bushes, yet in some places\r\nthey are dotted with the mauritia and other palms.\" Flat as they are,\r\ntwo kinds of inequalities will sometimes occur: one consists of banks or\r\nshoals of grit or compact limestone, five or six feet high, perfectly\r\nlevel for several leagues, and imperceptible except on their edges; the\r\nother inequality can only be detected by the barometer or levelling\r\ninstruments; it is called a _Mesa_, and is a gentle knoll swelling very\r\ngradually to an elevation of a few fathoms. Yet slight as is this\r\naltitude, a Mesa forms the watershed from south-west to north-east,\r\nbetween the affluents of the Orinoco and the streams flowing to the\r\nnorthern coast of Terra Firma. In the wet season, from April to the end\r\nof October, the tropical rains pour down in torrents, and hundreds of\r\nsquare miles of the Llanos are inundated by the overflow of the rivers.\r\nIn the hollows the water is sometimes twelve feet deep, and such numbers\r\nof horses and other animals perish, that the ground smells strongly of\r\nmusk, an odour peculiar to many quadrupeds. \"From the flatness of the\r\ncountry, too, the waters of some affluents of the Orinoco are driven\r\nbackwards by the floods of that river, especially when aided by the\r\nwind, and form temporary lakes. When the waters subside, these Steppes,\r\nmanured by the sediment, are mantled with verdure, and produce ananas,\r\nwhile occasional groups of fan palm-trees and mimosas skirt the rivers.\r\nWhen the dry weather returns, the grass is burnt to powder; the air is\r\nfilled with dust raised by currents occasioned by difference of\r\ntemperature, even when there is no wind. If by any accident a spark of\r\nfire falls on the scorched plains, a conflagration spreads from river to\r\nriver, destroying every animal, and leaves the clayey soil sterile for\r\nyears, till vicissitudes of weather crumble the brick-like surface into\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this takes place, the rending of the indurated soil is sudden and\r\nviolent, as if from the shock of an earthquake. If at such a time two\r\nopposing currents of air, whose conflict produces a rotatory motion,\r\ncome in contact with the surface of the earth, the Llanos assume a\r\nstrange and singular aspect. Like cone-shaped clouds, whose extremities\r\nseem to touch the ground, the sand rises through the rarefied air in the\r\nelectrically-charged centre of the whirling current; like the\r\nsand-spouts of the Saharan Desert, or the waterspouts which formerly\r\nwere the awe and dread of the mariner. Then does the lowering sky cast a\r\n\"dim uncertain light,\" like a November fog in London, on the desolate\r\nplain. The horizon draws suddenly nearer; the Steppe seems to contract,\r\nand a nameless terror seizes the heart of the wanderer. The hot dusty\r\nair increases in suffocating heat; and the east wind, blowing over the\r\nlong-heated soil, yields no refreshment, but rather oppresses with its\r\nburning glow. The pools, hitherto protected from evaporation by the\r\nyellow fading branches of the fan palm, begin to disappear. As in the\r\nnorth the animals grow torpid with the mortal cold, so under the\r\ninfluence of the parching drought the boa and the crocodile fall asleep,\r\nburied deeply in the dry mud. Everywhere the drought prevails, and yet\r\neverywhere the refracted rays of light delude the traveller with the\r\nimage of gleaming lakes and rushing rivers. The distant palm bush hovers\r\nabove the ground like a spectre, apparently raised by the influence of\r\nthe contact of unequally heated, and, therefore, unequally dense strata\r\nof air. Half hidden by the rolling clouds of dust, restless with the\r\npangs of thirst and hunger, the horses and cattle roam around, the\r\ncattle dismally lowing, and the horses stretching out their long necks\r\nand snuffing the wind, in the hope some moister current may betray the\r\nneighbourhood of a not wholly failing pool. More sagacious and astute,\r\nthe wary mule seeks a different mode of alleviating his thirst. Under\r\nits prickly envelope the melon-cactus conceals a watery pith. The mule\r\nfirst strikes the prickles aside with his fore-feet, and then cautiously\r\napproaches his lips to the plant and drinks the cool juice. But the\r\nexperiment is not always without danger, and many animals are lamed by\r\nthe spines of the cactus.\r\n\r\nWhen the overpowering heat of the day is followed by the cooler\r\ntemperature of the night, which is always of the same length in these\r\nlatitudes, even then the cattle can obtain no repose. Enormous bats suck\r\ntheir blood like the fabled vampires during their sleep, or attach\r\nthemselves to their backs, causing festering wounds in which mosquitoes,\r\nhorse-flies, and a host of stinging insects, niche themselves. Thus the\r\nanimals lead a weary life during the hot season. But at length, after\r\nthe long drought and the parching glow, comes the welcome rain! Then\r\ntakes place a transformation such as the fancy of the poet never\r\nsurpassed or equalled. The deep blue of the hitherto unclouded sky grows\r\nlighter; the dark space in the constellation of the Southern Cross is\r\nhardly distinguishable at night; the soft phosphorescent lustre of the\r\nso-called Magellanic clouds \"fades, fades, and falls away;\" even the\r\nstars in Aquila and Ophiucus in the zenith beam with a tremulous and\r\nless planetary radiance. And lo, yonder in the south, a single cloud,\r\nlike the peak of some remote mountain, soars perpendicularly from the\r\nhorizon. Gradually the gathering vapours fold over the sky. Hark! The\r\nthunder is pealing in the distance, and louder and nearer come its awful\r\nreverberation. It heralds the life-restoring rain! Scarcely has the\r\ngenial moisture refreshened earth, before a blessed fragrance breathes\r\nfrom the previously barren Steppe, and its nakedness is clothed upon\r\nwith the bloom and beauty of a thousand grasses. The herbaceous mimosas,\r\nwith renewed sensibility to the influence of light, open their drooping\r\nleaves to greet the rising sun; and the rosy-fingered morn is saluted\r\nwith a glad chorus of birds, and by the opening blossoms of the\r\nwater-plants. Now the horse bounds over the plain in keen ecstasy of\r\nspirit, and the cattle grazes plentifully on the fresh green herbage.\r\nYet the new life is not without its peril. _Anguis latet in herbâ._\r\nAmong the tall thick grass lurks the spotted jaguar, the tiger of the\r\nNew World, and measures carefully the distance that separates him from\r\nhis unsuspecting victim.\r\n\r\nSometimes (so say the natives) the moistened clay on the margin of the\r\nswamps will blister and swell slowly into a kind of mound until, with a\r\nviolent noise, like the outbreak of a small mud volcano, the accumulated\r\nearth is cast high into the air. The spectator who comprehends the\r\npurport of this strange scene immediately retreats, for he knows that\r\nthe birth of the portentous travail will be a gigantic water-snake or\r\nhuge crocodile roused from its torpidity.\r\n\r\nThe rivers which bound the plain to the south--the Arauca, the Apure,\r\nand the Pajara--gradually swell, and now Nature compels the same\r\nanimals, which in the first half of the year panted with thirst on the\r\ndry and dusty soil, to adopt an amphibious life. A portion of the Steppe\r\nnow assumes the aspect of a vast inland sea.[93] The brood mares retire\r\nwith their foals to the more elevated banks, which rise like islands\r\nabove the watery expanse. Every day the dry space grows smaller. It is a\r\nminiature reproduction of the Noachian Deluge. The animals, crowded\r\ntogether, swim about for hours in quest of other pasture, and feed\r\nsparingly on the tops of the flowering grasses that spring above the\r\nseething surface of the turbid waters. Many foals are drowned, and many\r\nare surprised by the crocodiles, killed by a blow from their powerful\r\ntails, and devoured. It is no uncommon thing to see the marks of these\r\nmonsters' cruel teeth on the legs of horses and cattle which have\r\nnarrowly escaped from their blood-thirsty jaws. Such a sight reminds the\r\nthoughtful observer of that capability of adaptation to the most varied\r\ncircumstances with which the all-powerful Creator has endowed certain\r\nanimals and plants.[94]\r\n\r\nThe Pampas of Pernambuco and Buenos Ayres have three times the\r\nsuperficial area of the Llanos of Venezuela. So great is their extent,\r\nthat while forests of palms border them on the north, they are covered\r\nwith snow in the south, during a great part of the year, like the\r\nnorthern Steppes of Tartary. According to the climatic divisions\r\ngenerally adopted, these regions belong to the Temperate Zone; but in\r\ntruth they comprehend a great variety of climates. Their character is\r\nnot less grand or original than that of the Llanos which precede them.\r\n\"The Pampas,\" says an American writer, \"surpass in majesty all the\r\nmarvels of the new continent, and yet they astonish the traveller by the\r\nair of abandonment and sadness which is impressed upon them, especially\r\nin the low country watered by the Plata. Traces of life are there\r\ninfrequent; still rarer are the objects which attract attention. Here,\r\nat the bottom of a crevasse, a cactus conceals its head bristling with\r\nspines; there, a solitary tree rises majestically toward heaven.\r\nSometimes, upon the plain, the eye discovers the monstrous skeleton of\r\nan animal which flourished in those remote times when the Alps still\r\nslept in the depths of ocean, and dreamed not of blending their\r\nsnow-burdened peaks with the clouds. The Pampas serve as the\r\nburial-place for races of gigantic men, now extinct, who seem to issue\r\nfrom their silent graves in testimony to the former being of vanished\r\ngenerations, and to bear witness to the Creator of all things. Above\r\nyour head, and far away in the azure of heaven, you perceive a black\r\npoint; it is a condor describing slowly its sinister circles. In the\r\ndistance passes and disappears the ungainly figure of an ostrich. The\r\ninexpressible charm of these solitudes is their absolute freedom. And\r\nwhile traversing them the wayfarer comprehends the love with which they\r\ninspire the Indian, whose hope it is to meet beyond this world with yet\r\nvaster horizons for the indulgence of his wandering tastes.\"\r\n\r\nAt the southern extremity of South America spreads a sterile plain, sown\r\nwith pebbles and blocks of porphyry: it is Patagonia. As we retrace our\r\nsteps towards the north, the soil rises before us in terrace after\r\nterrace, till it reaches the base of the Cordilleras. In the northern\r\ndistricts the pebbly soil gives place to verdant meadows, where the\r\nPatagonians breed numerous herds of horses and cattle. Water is wanting\r\nin this country. The rains are rare, and the dry seasons very prolonged.\r\nThe summer heat is overwhelming; in winter violent winds sweep the\r\nSavannahs, which are covered with nocturnal frosts. Under such climatic\r\ninfluences the soil produces only a dry coarse grass. In the interior a\r\nfew beeches and cacti are met with, and then broad swamps, fringed with\r\nreeds and rushes. In the spring a mantle of clover spreads over the\r\nearth, but only to be withered up by the first heats of summer.\r\n\r\nAlong the banks of the Rio Negro the Pampas of Buenos Ayres stretch from\r\nthe coast of the Atlantic to the foot of the Andes. On a considerable\r\nportion of this vast area marshes of salt water encroach--a phenomenon\r\nall the more curious because the salt lies only on the surface, and all\r\nthe wells artificially excavated yield fresh water. During the rains the\r\nlow grounds are flooded; but as soon as the sun has dried up the plain,\r\nit is clothed in rich pasturage, while the elevated table-lands are dry\r\nand withered. There, too, the dryness is often attended with disastrous\r\nresults. From 1827 to 1830, as Mr. Darwin records, not a drop of water\r\nfell; all traces of vegetation disappeared; the rivers ran dry, and the\r\nherds perished in incalculable numbers; in the single province of Buenos\r\nAyres, the loss was estimated at more than a million head of cattle.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Rio Salado, at the portals of the Andes, the country\r\nassumes a look of implacable desolation; no winds ever agitate the lower\r\nstrata of the atmosphere. The water-courses which descend from the\r\nmountains lose themselves in the sand; salt marshes, whence the very\r\nbirds hold aloof, alone alternate with a soil everywhere intersected by\r\ncrevices. The district of the Pampas which stretches northward to the\r\nspurs of the Andes consists of a sandy soil, free from salt, but wholly\r\nunproductive. These solitudes, however, are ploughed by running streams,\r\nnone of which communicate with the sea. They descend from the Andes,\r\ntraverse the Pampas from east to west, and empty themselves into the\r\nsaline lakes. Somewhat further to the north, and nearer the Equator,\r\nlies an almost unknown region of salt--a region of indescribable gloom,\r\nwhere neither tree, nor bush, nor blade of emerald grass, delights the\r\neye. Eighteen months frequently elapse in this land of desolation,\r\nworthy of being one of the circles in Dante's \"Inferno,\" without the\r\ncheering sound of a shower of rain, and when at length it arrives, it\r\nsplits the rocks of salt and melts them into wide pools of brackish\r\nmud. As soon as the sun has absorbed the excessive humidity of the soil,\r\nmyriads of salt crystals glitter on the surface, and convert the Desert\r\ninto one immense mirror.\r\n\r\nTo the north-west of La Plata extends a desert of very different\r\ncharacter--the _Despoblado_, or uninhabited land, a plateau of the\r\nAndes, rising some 4200 feet above the level of the sea. This desert is\r\ncloven into two portions by a deep valley, bordered with sharp rocks,\r\nwhich affords the only practicable route from Bolivia to Buenos Ayres.\r\nWinter, in this sombre world within a world, is a time of horror, when\r\nthe spirit of Desolation goes to and fro in wrath unchained. Yet even\r\nhere humanity drags about the fetters of existence. The traveller\r\noccasionally alights upon the wretched huts where the unfortunate\r\ndescendants of the ancient Peruvians linger through life. Their wealth\r\nconsists in a few llamas. Their occupation, in hunting the alpaca, the\r\nguanaco, and the chinchilla; in filtering the river sands for scanty\r\ngrains of gold; in collecting salt, and disposing of it to the\r\ninhabitants of the nearest towns.\r\n\r\n\"The aspect of the Puna, or Despoblado,\" says Von Tschudi,[95] \"is\r\nsingularly monotonous and dreary. The expansive levels are scantily\r\ncovered with grasses of a yellowish-brown hue, and are never enlivened\r\nby fresh-looking verdure. Here and there, at distant intervals, may be\r\nseen a few stunted Quenera trees,[96] or large patches of ground covered\r\nwith the Ratanbia shrub.[97] Both are used by the Indians as fuel, and\r\nfor roofing their huts. The cold climate and sterile soil are formidable\r\nimpediments to agriculture. Only one plant is cultivated in these\r\nregions with any degree of success. It is the _maca_, a tuberous root\r\ngrown like the potato, and, like it, used as an article of food. In many\r\nof the Puna districts it constitutes the principal sustenance of the\r\ninhabitants. It has an agreeable and somewhat sweetish flavour, and when\r\nboiled in milk it tastes like the chestnut.\"\r\n\r\nThe most imposing spectacle presented by the Deserts of South America is\r\nthat of their frequent hurricanes. As the Simoom to the Sahara, so is\r\nthe Pampero to the Pampas. Its approach is foretold by signs which the\r\nnative's experienced eye readily recognizes. All at once the air seems\r\nstricken motionless, and over the solitude broods a solemn silence. A\r\ncloud white and light as snow--a cloud \"no bigger than a man's\r\nhand\"--rises in the south-west. It advances, and as it advances enlarges\r\nits proportions. Other clouds appear, and all gather into one imposing\r\nmass. The dust rises and whirls round in thick columns suspended between\r\nheaven and earth. Lower and lower descend the congregated vapours, until\r\nthey envelop the earth in a funeral shroud, whose folds the hurricane\r\nincessantly agitates, and which the forked lightnings seem to rend in\r\nfragments. Suffocating gusts of a fiery wind traverse space. And now the\r\nsudden tempest stoops down from the summit of the Andes, and sweeps the\r\nSavannah with resistless fury. Enormous masses of sand, upgathered by\r\nthe _rafale_, obscure the clearness of day; at noon the earth is covered\r\nwith a darkness that may be felt. The thunder mingles its roar with the\r\nstrident voices of the storm. All that lives, all that breathes, is at\r\nthe mercy of the unchained elements, which are as pitiless in their\r\nwrath as a roused people. Thousands of animals perish in the Savannahs;\r\nand prostrate, with his face to the earth, man tremblingly awaits the\r\nexpiring breath of the grand convulsion!\r\n\r\nThe horses and cattle of Europe are replaced in the Pampas of South\r\nAmerica by the herds of guanacos and llamas which covered them at the\r\nepoch of the Spanish conquest. Their owners, descendants of the\r\nSpaniards intermingled with the native races, possess many of the\r\ncharacteristics of the Arab.\r\n\r\nLike the llanero of Venezuela, the guacho of the Pampas realizes the\r\nidea of the ancient centaur; and from the throne of his saddle, to which\r\nhangs the inseparable _lasso_, he surveys the plains where he is lord\r\nand king with the fiery glance of a free and independent spirit. He owes\r\nscant allegiance to any established authority, and under the blue sky of\r\nheaven enjoys the blessings of uncontrolled freedom. And what to him\r\nthe fever and turmoil of civilization, when, mounted on his noble steed,\r\nhe can roam at will, with none to say him nay, over leagues and leagues\r\nof grassy prairies!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE AUSTRALIAN INTERIOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographers have given the name of the \"fifth division of the globe\" to\r\nthat immense archipelago, or rather, that mass of archipelagoes which\r\nremote geological convulsions have elevated in the Pacific Ocean,\r\nbetween the three continents, Asia, Africa, and America, and whose\r\nexistence was first revealed to the Western World by the maritime\r\nexplorations of the Portuguese and the Dutch, in the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries. From the epoch when these enterprises commenced,\r\nthe spherical figure of the earth was established beyond dispute; and\r\nafter the discovery of America, it became only reasonable to suppose\r\nthat, in virtue of a law without which our planet could not have\r\nmaintained its equilibrium in space, there must exist a continent\r\nintended to balance those of the Northern Hemisphere. But for many years\r\nall the researches of intrepid navigators only led them to the shores of\r\nsmall islands and islets, not a few of which were barren, uninhabited,\r\nand swept by the winds of ocean; while others, girdled with palms,\r\nenriched with vegetation, and blessed by bland and genial airs, seemed\r\nto realize the poetical idea of the Fortunate Islands,\r\n\r\n    \"Summer isles of Eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, however, by directing their investigations towards the less\r\nsubmerged region of the Indian Ocean, and by sailing beyond the great\r\neastern islands which seem to have been formerly connected with the\r\nIndian Peninsula, the Portuguese mariners were the first to descry a\r\nlong line of coast which they did not doubt was that of an Austral\r\nContinent, whose satellites, so to speak, were the previously discovered\r\nislands. This supposed continent is still represented in the old maps\r\npublished at the close of the seventeenth and the beginning of the\r\neighteenth centuries, by a mass of ill-defined contours, with this\r\nindication: _Terra Australis incognita_. The succeeding voyages of\r\nCarpenter, Nuyts, Tasman, and the illustrious Cook, proved that this\r\nAustral or Southern Land was in effect a continent, or, at least, an\r\nisland of extraordinary dimensions, whose coasts alone--and these but a\r\nsmall extent inland--were inhabited by miserable tribes, with black\r\nskin, and hideous features, placed at the extreme limit which separates\r\nman from the brute. The Dutch navigators, who had first determined the\r\nprincipal outlines of this continent, named it New Holland, but after it\r\npassed into the hands of England, it received, as it still preserves,\r\nthe appellation of Australia.\r\n\r\nTake away from this Australian Continent its fertile districts in the\r\nsouth-east, where have sprung up and developed with amazing rapidity the\r\nflourishing colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland, and\r\nwhat remains? A country entirely wild, and, one might almost venture to\r\nsay, an immense Desert. The gloomy aspect and the barrenness of its\r\nnorthern shores, with few exceptions, had repulsed the early Portuguese\r\nand Dutch navigators, who little suspected what splendid treasures were\r\nhidden among its auriferous sands and rocks. They saw but insufficient\r\nrivers and scanty vegetation, and went no further.\r\n\r\nNone of the rivers of New Holland are navigable to any great distance\r\nfrom their mouths. The want of water is severely felt in the interior,\r\nwhere a treeless desert of sand, swamps, and jungle is intersected by\r\nstreams called \"creeks,\" which are dry for the greater portion of the\r\nyear; yet a belief long prevailed that a large sea or fresh-water lake\r\noccupied the centre--a belief founded partly on the nature of the soil,\r\nand partly on the circumstance that all the rivers that flow into the\r\nsea on the northern coast, between the Gulf of Van Diemen and\r\nCarpentaria, converge towards their sources, as if they served for\r\ndrains to some large body of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUSTRALIAN LANDSCAPE.]\r\n\r\nThe eastern side of the country is traversed by a great range of thinly\r\ntimbered down, clothed with grasses and herbage, and rising to an\r\nelevation of 3500 feet. These are known as the Blue Mountains, and\r\nstretch from north to south over nearly thirty degrees of latitude, from\r\nCape York to Cape Wilson. All their western slopes descend gradually\r\ntowards the interior, until they are lost in the vast desert plain of\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\nThe streams which flow in this direction either pour their waters into\r\nthe great rivers, such as the Darling and the Murray, which has an\r\ninternal navigation of 1800 miles, or lose themselves in the marshes and\r\nlakes, which the great summer heats periodically dry up.\r\n\r\nAnother chain of mountains stretches from south to north along the\r\nwestern coast of Australia, from Point d'Entrecasteaux to Murchison\r\nRiver. A third chain, in the northern region, runs from east to west,\r\nbetween Camden Harbour and the Gulf of Carpentaria. The interior of the\r\ncountry is, as I have already indicated, in all probability an immense\r\nplain, thinly sown with trees of the two families of Acaciæ and\r\nEucalypti, and tenanted by the wombat and the kangaroo.\r\n\r\nOver this vast portion of Australia, which still remains a blank upon\r\nthe map, numerous expeditions of discovery have been attempted since the\r\nearliest days of European colonization. Hardy pioneers--those men who\r\nare the real, but obscure, and speedily forgotten founders of\r\nempires--have sacrificed their lives in the endeavour to lay down a\r\ntrack across the great island-continent from north to south. Anglo-Saxon\r\nenterprise no sooner found itself securely planted on the sea-coast,\r\nthan it felt that behind it lay a continent to acquire, and the\r\nindomitable instinct of the race bade it continue its mission of\r\ncolonization. During the last quarter of a century, the colonial\r\ngovernments have liberally encouraged these explorations, and the annals\r\nof Australian discovery have been illuminated by the names of Eyre\r\n(1840), Sturt (1845), Leichardt (1846-48), Kennedy (1848), and M'Douall\r\nStuart (1858-62), second to none among our English discoverers in\r\npatience, resolution, and heroic daring.\r\n\r\nThe problem remained: to cross the central wilderness of Australia, and\r\nprove the possibility of a passage from the southern shores to the\r\nnorthern, from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. This problem was\r\nfinally solved, at no light cost, by the intrepid Burke and energetic\r\nWills.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of April 1860, there set out from Melbourne, under the\r\nauspices of the Government of Victoria, a small troop of gallant\r\nexplorers, under the immediate direction of Robert O'Hara Burke, a man\r\nwell-fitted for his post: born in the county of Galway in 1821, after\r\nhaving served as captain in a Hungarian regiment, he had discharged for\r\nseveral years the duties of inspector of a body of the colonial police.\r\n\r\nThe second in command was a brave young Englishman, William John Wills,\r\ntwenty-six years of age, an assistant in the Observatory at Melbourne.\r\n\r\nThe expedition consisted of eighteen persons, and was provided with\r\nhorses, camels which had been expressly imported from Arabia, waggons,\r\nall kinds of scientific instruments, and the necessary amount of stores\r\nand provisions for a protracted journey.\r\n\r\nCooper's Creek, which marked about a third of the whole distance, was\r\nfixed upon as place of rendezvous and as the final starting-point.\r\nThither, to save time, Burke and Wills, with six men, six camels, five\r\nhorses, and some months' provisions, proceeded in advance of the main\r\nbody; and arriving there on the 13th of December, Burke established a\r\ndepôt, left it in charge of Brahé, a petty officer, and three\r\nassistants, and with Wills, a couple of men (King and Gray), the camels,\r\nand one horse, plunged on the 16th into the trackless Australian\r\nwilds.[98]\r\n\r\nKeeping nearly due north, and near or upon the meridian of 140° E., they\r\ntraversed, day after day, well-watered plains, with numerous clumps of\r\nwood, and tolerable indications of a good grazing country. On the 12th\r\nof February 1861, the four travellers had conquered every obstacle, and\r\nstruck the marshes on the Albert River, which flows into the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria. Their goal was reached, and the problem of a connecting\r\nroute between north and south successfully solved.\r\n\r\nThe vast Australian solitudes hitherto traversed had presented every\r\nvariety of aspect, from the stony plateaux and the watery sands where\r\nthe rivers can keep no regular channel, and where wide spaces of dry\r\nbare ground separate great shallows of brackish water, to finely\r\nirrigated plains, clothed with herbs or bushes, and promising abundant\r\nresources for future colonists. Meteorological phenomena present in\r\nthese regions the greatest uncertainties: either the dry season is so\r\nprotracted as to ruin all vegetation, or the rains so thoroughly deluge\r\nthe soil as by a contrary cause to ensure the same result. These\r\nclimatic contradictions explain the variations observable in the\r\nnarratives of the different travellers who have visited the interior.\r\nOne point, however, is beyond all doubt; the hopeless sterility of Nuyts\r\nLand,--that immense sandy tract which, over an extent as yet unknown, is\r\nregarded as impassable, and stretches along the southern coast between\r\nSpencer Gulf and King George Harbour. As before said, the primary cause\r\nof the barrenness of Central Australia is the lack of water--running\r\nwater and rain water. Yet the most sterile portions lie far nearer the\r\ncoast than was formerly credited; and monotonous as may be the\r\ndescriptions of explorers, so far as the landscapes of Central Australia\r\nare concerned, we may from to-day consider that, with the exception of\r\ncertain points, no obstacles exist sufficiently powerful to arrest the\r\nexpansion of European colonization, in a country especially where\r\ncattle-breeding is the principal industry, and the one which takes\r\nprecedence of all others.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty encountered by each exploring party has been the\r\npenury of natural products of the soil adapted for human food. The\r\ntraveller is compelled to carry with him a sufficiency of provisions to\r\nlast him from his departure until his return. It was this insufficiency\r\nof rations which wrought the fatal dénouement of the glorious enterprise\r\nof Burke and Wills.\r\n\r\nAfter reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria, there remained nothing more for\r\nBurke and his three companions but to retrace their steps to their depôt\r\nat Cooper's Creek. But their energies were exhausted, and from the\r\nbeginning of April their provisions failed them. At the close of ten or\r\ntwelve days' march, they were constrained to kill a horse. In the\r\nfollowing week, Gray succumbed to the excessive fatigue. The three\r\nsurvivors dragged themselves on to the depôt, where they arrived on the\r\nmorning of the 21st of April. But the men whom they had left in charge\r\nhad taken their departure that very morning, after waiting long beyond\r\nthe time originally fixed for their return.\r\n\r\n\"You may imagine our consternation,\" says Wills in his Journal, under\r\nthe date of April 21st; \"four months of harassing marches and privations\r\nof every kind had completely exhausted our strength. It was an extremely\r\ndifficult task for either of us to accomplish a distance of only a few\r\nyards. The effort necessary to ascend the smallest elevation of the\r\nground, even without a burden, induces an indescribable sensation of\r\npain and helplessness, and the general lassitude makes one unfit for\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no resource now but to rejoin Brahé and his men, if possible.\r\nBefore quitting the depôt, the latter had left a small supply of\r\nprovisions, which proved eminently serviceable. On the 23rd Burke,\r\nWills, and King resumed their march, at the rate of four or five miles\r\na-day, in the direction of Mount Despair, which was about sixty miles\r\ndistant, and where were placed the most advanced posts, northward, of\r\nSouth Australia. A terrible fatality, however, seemed to pursue them;\r\none of their camels, Landa, perished in a bog; the other, Rajah, they\r\nwere soon forced to kill for food; then they themselves were compelled\r\nby sheer exhaustion to return to the depôt, which, meanwhile, had been\r\nrevisited by Brahé without his discovering a trace of their brief\r\nsojourn. Thus abandoned to perish in the Desert, they existed upon the\r\nbounty of such natives as they met with, and who occasionally supplied\r\nthem with a few fish and a little _nardoo_, an aquatic plant whose\r\npounded seeds the aborigines make into bread. Such a regimen was\r\ninsufficient to restore their exhausted strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURKE, WILLS, AND KING IN THE DESERTS OF CENTRAL\r\nAUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\nEarly in June their afflictions were aggravated by a deplorable\r\ncatastrophe. The flames of their bivouac fire, driven by a strong wind,\r\nreduced to ashes their hut and all that they possessed. There was\r\nnothing for them now but to live with the friendly natives who had\r\nsuccoured them. Unfortunately, they had disappeared. It was in vain they\r\nattempted to seek them out; Burke and Wills never saw them again.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the 29th of June, the latter, utterly exhausted, insisted\r\nthat his companions should leave him in the wilderness, while they\r\ncontinued their search after the natives. Unwillingly they consented,\r\nand taking a solemn farewell of their unfortunate comrade, they dragged\r\nthemselves away with aching hearts. Four or five days afterwards, King\r\nreturned with some birds he had contrived to kill, but found Wills\r\nasleep in the arms of death. King was now alone, for the intrepid Burke\r\nhad also fallen a victim to the cruel spirit of the wilderness, resting\r\non the barren ground, with his face upturned to the southern stars. The\r\nsole survivor was fortunate enough to fall in with the natives, who\r\nwelcomed him cordially, and carried him with them from camp to camp.\r\nAfter two months and a half of this strange existence, he was discovered\r\nby a relief party sent out from Melbourne, under the command of Mr.\r\nHowitt (September 15, 1861), who also gathered the remains of the two\r\ngallant but ill-fated leaders, and reverently consigned them to a decent\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nThey had not died in vain. From the shores of Port Philip to those of\r\nthe Gulf of Carpentaria they had discovered and marked out a practicable\r\nroute; and when the great Australian colonies shall have pushed forward\r\ninto the interior, and have occupied the borders of the northern gulf,\r\nthey will remember with gratitude the brave explorers who sacrificed\r\ntheir lives to effect the passage from one sea to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE LIFE IN THE AFRICAN PLAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts actually ascertained in reference to the Flora of the plains\r\nof Central Africa, although as yet of a limited character, form as a\r\nwhole too comprehensive a subject to be fully discussed in these pages.\r\nI must, therefore, confine myself to a rapid survey of the principal\r\nbotanical features of the countries whose general features and physical\r\naspect I have sketched in the preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nSenegambia and Upper Guinea, on the west coast of Africa, form a low\r\ntable-land, situated upwards of 3000 feet above the sea-level, and\r\nfurrowed by deep gorges, in whose rocky beds the rivers roll and foam,\r\nfed by the waters of numerous streams. Grassy savannahs and wide\r\ncultivated areas are here inhabited by a numerous population. Several\r\ntravellers have explored these regions; but all have specially applied\r\nthemselves to make known the colossal plants which flourish therein, and\r\nthose, first and foremost, which have a particular interest, either from\r\ntheir Anak-like stature or the manifold uses of their products. I shall\r\nhave occasion to speak of the arborescent species which, in this part of\r\nthe Old Continent, blend in immense and impenetrable forests. But owing\r\nto this very circumstance we possess few details respecting the plants\r\nwhich clothe the vast plains of Senegambia and Upper Guinea. We only\r\nknow that there, as everywhere, the great family of the Gramineæ is\r\nlargely represented. In general these species far exceed in height the\r\nplants which make the wealth and glory of our English meads; and they\r\nchiefly belong to the tribe of Paniceæ. A legion of Cassias inhabit the\r\nlow fresh hills of the Senegambian lands; and some are held in high\r\nestimation for their fruit, as the Cassia, or Senna, which is considered\r\none of the most active purgatives. The species generally recognized as\r\nbest adapted for medicinal purposes are those with oboval and those with\r\nobtuse leaves--_Cassia obovata_ and _Cassia obtusifolia_. The former is\r\na perennial herbaceous plant, from one to two feet high, with smooth\r\negg-shaped leaves and racemes of yellow flowers; the latter differs only\r\nin the form of its leaves, which are short and broad, or obtuse.\r\n\r\nMany of the cereals are cultivated in Senegambia on a very large scale;\r\nbut they differ wholly from those which engage the attention of the\r\nEuropean agriculturist. Barley will not grow even on the most elevated\r\nplateaux, on account of the constant and excessive heat. It is true that\r\nit will germinate; but it develops so rapidly that it passes through all\r\nthe phases of its vegetation in the space of a few weeks, and yields but\r\nimpoverished ears empty of grains; it is useless to the people of\r\nSenegambia except as forage. But, on the other hand, there are numerous\r\nGramineæ adapted to hot regions, which the natives cultivate for their\r\nuses. Among others I may name the Tocussa and the Coracan (_Eleasine\r\nTocussa_ and _E. Corocana_), with their curved digitate spikes and\r\nproductive seeds; the _Pennicellaria spicata_, or Guinea Corn, a very\r\ntall grass, somewhat resembling maize, whose long cylindrical culms or\r\nblades bear each a multitude of white round grains, which, ground into\r\nmeal, form very savoury cakes, as you may read in Mungo Park's Travels;\r\nand the _Durra_, _Doura_, _Indian Millet_, or _Sorgho Grass_\r\n(_Sorghum_), a coarse, strong, broad-leaved grass, four to eight feet\r\nhigh, with a round grain a little larger than mustard seed; it is the\r\nprincipal corn-plant of Africa, and exceedingly nutritious, the natives\r\nemploying it in the preparation of a favourite dish named Kouskoussou.\r\n\r\nThe cereals most widely cultivated in Senegal include the Colonial\r\nMillet (_Oplismenus colonus_); the Abyssinian Meadow Grass (_Poa\r\nAbyssinica_), called \"Teff\" in Abyssinia, whose seeds are used for\r\nmaking bread, and whose blades yield an abundant herbage; Rice (_Oryza\r\nsativa_), and different varieties of maize. Leguminous plants appear\r\nwanting in Senegal. Their absence is probably due to the same causes as\r\nthose which we have indicated as affecting the growth of barley.\r\nCabbages and the different salads grow, in fact, with a rapidity which\r\nprevents them from maturing; they flower in two or three weeks after\r\nbeing sown. The inhabitants consequently resort to those alimentary\r\nspecies which belong to hot countries, and which can only be obtained in\r\nEurope at an enormous expense and by artificial means. Among the plants\r\nwith edible roots are various kinds of Yams (such as the _Dioscorea\r\nalata_); Batatas (_Convolvulus Batatas_); and the Manioc or Manihot\r\n(_Jatropha Manihot_),[99] better known as Cassava, which, although in\r\nitself a deadly poison, is easily deprived by heat of its noxious\r\nproperties, and when roasted or boiled becomes a nutritious and highly\r\nsavoury food. It yields the valuable farinaceous material of Tapioca.\r\nIts leaves are cooling and healing; from its seeds an excellent oil is\r\nprocured; and the juice which drops from its root serves for\r\nempoisoning arrows. Good and evil are both strangely mixed in this\r\nimportant plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN THE AFRICAN PLAINS.\r\n\r\n1. Guinea Corn (_Pennicillaria spicata_).\r\n2. Sorgho Grass (_Sorghum cernuum_).\r\n3. Manihot (_Jatropha Manihot_).\r\n4. Yam (_Dioscorea alata_).\r\n5. Screw Pine (_Pandanus candelabrum_).\r\n6. Black Pepper (_Piper nigrum_).]\r\n\r\nThe _Corchorus olitorius_,[100] an annual cultivated in Egypt as a\r\npotherb, is largely grown in Senegal for the tenacious fibres of its\r\nroot and the oily juices of its seeds. The Black Pepper (_Piper nigrum_)\r\nof India and the Sunda Isles we find perfectly acclimatized in this part\r\nof Africa, and it flourishes even in a wild state. Finally, the\r\nCoffee-tree (_Coffea Arabica_), the Cocoa (_Theobroma Cacao_), Indigo\r\n(_Indigofera tinctoria_), and the _Cocos oleracea_, are among the\r\ncultivated plants of Senegambia.\r\n\r\nIn northern Guinea and the Gaboon, recently made famous by Du Chaillu's\r\ndiscovery of the gorilla, Savannahs and cultivated districts are\r\nintermingled, though their flora is still imperfectly known. A great\r\nnumber of grasses adorn the fresh and humid prairies, and sedges and\r\nreeds abound, while, on the river-banks, in shady nooks, flourish some\r\nof the Screw-pine tribe,[101] notably the _Pandanus Candelabrum_, a\r\nhighly curious plant, which attracts one's attention by its mode of\r\nvegetation, its graceful ribbon-like foliage, and its small fragrant\r\nflowers. Thatching and cordage are obtained from the fibrous leaves; the\r\nfruit resembles a richly-coloured pine-apple, but is insipid to the\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nThe Savannahs of the neighbouring provinces, and especially those of the\r\nGold Coast, are in general sparsely inhabited, nor are those on the\r\nbanks of the Niger an exception; man shrinks from a region which the\r\ndeadly malaria seems to claim as its own. The flora is very poor,\r\nconsisting chiefly of aquatic grasses, with blades of moderate height,\r\nand leaves of comparatively little succulence. The herbaceous plants,\r\nsuitable for food or industrial uses, which are most frequently met with\r\nin Guinea and the Gaboon, resemble those already described as belonging\r\nalso to Senegambia. But there are many different Arums, such as the\r\n_Caladium segmium_ and _Colocasia mucronatum_, properly known as Taro,\r\nTara, or Tayo, and employed in making granulate sugar from the stem of\r\nthe former, and in boiling or roasting for food the rhizomæ of the\r\nlatter; Tobacco; the ox-heart Annona, a plant sometimes cultivated in\r\nEurope, where it never fructifies, though its aromatic fruits are its\r\nmost valuable product, and are highly esteemed by the Africans,--these\r\n\"Custard Apples\" resembling thick cream, and being eaten, like cream,\r\nwith a spoon; the Banana,[102] with its gigantic foliage--precious \"Musa\r\nSapientum \"--valuable not only to \"wise men,\" but foolish men, as a\r\nsubstitute for wheat or the breadfruit tree, and gratifying the savage\r\nwith a succulent and nutritious food. Forty or fifty banana plants will\r\nflourish in a square space of one thousand feet, and an acre of ground\r\nwill yield sufficient provision for fifty men. That area of land which,\r\nsown with wheat, would feed only one man, will nourish five-and-twenty\r\nif planted with bananas.\r\n\r\nI must not forget the Pistachios,[103] which flourish spontaneously in\r\nthe vast plains of Central Africa, and the highly valuable Sugar Cane\r\n(_Saccharum officinarum_), which, like the Cotton Plant, has rendered\r\ninestimable services to man, and yet has been the origin of unutterable\r\ncrime and misery, promoting by its cultivation the accursed slave-trade.\r\nThe Vine (_Vitis vinifera_) is cultivated in a few districts. Among the\r\nherbaceous or sub-frutescent plants peculiar to this region, and which\r\nenjoy a certain reputation on account of the utility of their products,\r\nI may name the following:--\r\n\r\nThe Calebash Nutmeg (_Monodora myristica_), one of the Annonaceæ,\r\nremarkable for its withered fruits, which, when rasped like its seeds,\r\nfurnish a condiment deservedly esteemed by the natives; Guinea Pepper\r\n(_Uvaria Æthiopica_), whose properties are well known and appreciated in\r\nthis part of Western Africa; and finally, one of the Cucurbitaceæ, the\r\n_Telfairia pedata_, whose seeds enclose a very oleaginous substance.\r\n\r\nTo the east, in Nigritia or the Soudan, the country is nearly level,\r\nalthough situated at an elevation of 1200 to 1300 feet above the sea.\r\nThe vegetation here is very scanty; yet the copious tropical rains\r\nfavour the growth of plants suitable for the provender of cattle;\r\npastures are abundant, and formed by the principal Grasses (Panicum\r\nSetaria, and the like), the Sedges, Rushes, &c. These meads are clothed\r\nwith verdure for three or four months of the year, and much frequented\r\nby the shepherds who dwell in the vicinity of Lake Tchad.\r\n\r\nStill further eastward, if we continue our wanderings, we plunge into\r\nthe warm regions of Darfour and Kordofan. Here the country is cast in\r\nbold outlines; numerous lofty mountain-chains are intersected by narrow\r\nvalleys and smooth expanses of meadow-land. All that portion of Kordofan\r\nwhich lies west of the White Nile is a Prairie some thirty-five miles\r\nlong by twenty-eight broad, stretching towards the rising sun, and\r\nrelieved by small patches of shrubs of the family _Leguminosæ_,\r\nespecially the Mimosa, with its graceful shrinking foliage, which\r\nshudders at the lightest touch, and its spherical rose-hued or\r\nsnow-white blossoms.\r\n\r\nThese meadow-lands suffer from excessive aridity; it is only with an\r\narduous struggle that a few grasses resist the dryness which almost\r\nconstantly prevails; and frequently, as is the case in other parts of\r\nWestern Africa, the inhabitants can only procure water for their needs\r\nby sinking wells of extraordinary depth. Less arid, the southern part of\r\nKordofan is better clothed with vegetation; the country is more broken,\r\nand increases in picturesqueness of aspect as we approach the\r\nneighbourhood of Mount Tegeler. Sennaar, which is traversed by the Blue\r\nNile, is far from offering an equally luxuriant vegetation: along the\r\nriver extends a vast belt of meadow, generally barren, or only blessed\r\nwith a few herbaceous plants, a few Leguminosæ, with deeply-buried\r\nroots; and its aspect, therefore, is one of great gloom. The landscape\r\nwants\r\n\r\n    \"The glory in the grass, and the splendour in the flower\"\r\n\r\nwhich appeal so potently to the sensibilities of the poet. Nor does the\r\nscenery improve as we ascend the Sennaar to the Lake of Zana, situated\r\nto the south-east, for though the rich black soil of the Kulla valley\r\nnourishes a profuse vegetation, it is the vegetation peculiar to the\r\nmarsh and the swamp; the wind rushes through thick sedges, and\r\nwhispering reeds, and waving grasses. On the northern borders of the\r\nlake the pasturages are fresh and green, and a man might easily lurk\r\nunseen among their gigantic Gramineæ, the Panicas and the Setarias.\r\nStill keeping our faces eastward, like the Ghebirs of ancient Iran, we\r\nperceive that Abyssinia is divided into two parts by the River Tacazze,\r\nan affluent of the Nile; the western being called Amhora, and the\r\neastern Tigré. Owing to its peculiar geographical configuration and the\r\nelevation of its mountains, Abyssinia rejoices in a wholly special\r\nFlora. In the Semen, west of the Tacazze, there is a mountain lifting\r\nits crest above the limit of perpetual snow, or to an altitude of 14,000\r\nfeet. Up to a height of 6500 feet its slopes are thickly carpeted with\r\nfresh and fragrant sward, and the air throbs with the music of a hundred\r\nstreams which flow from the perennial fountains of ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn the Tigré the country is not fertile, nor is it well populated. Its\r\ngeological features are interesting, for we meet everywhere with\r\nisolated masses of limestone, arranged generally in horizontal strata of\r\nvarious extent, and bearing indisputable traces of a vast volcanic\r\nlabour. On the coast of the Red Sea, the oriental slopes only present at\r\ntheir base a few scattered thickets chiefly composed of thorny shrubs\r\nand the Leguminosæ. We meet also with various kinds of Aloes and\r\nEuphorbiaceæ (Spurge-Worts), as the _Euphorbia neriifolia_, _Euphorbia\r\ngrandidens_, and _Euphorbia Abyssinica_. It is said that King Juba II.,\r\nof Mauritania, discovered the plant growing on Mount Atlas, wrote a\r\nshort treatise on its virtues, and named it after his physician\r\nEuphorbos (about the end of the first century B.C.) The root, generally\r\nspeaking, is aperient, and the milky juice useful in cases of rheumatism\r\nand cramp.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Tigré present a beautiful appearance with the variety of\r\nflowers that bloom among the grass; including a kind of scarlet aloe,\r\nwhich is to be met with almost everywhere in Tigré, and appears, like\r\nour gorse, to flower at all seasons, forming a graceful object in the\r\nforeground. The many varieties of mimosas, too, with their\r\ndifferent-coloured blossoms--pink, yellow, and white--appear to be\r\nspread over the whole face of the country, whether rock or plain, hill\r\nor valley. \"When in blossom,\" says an English traveller,[104] \"many of\r\nthem emit a fragrance so powerful as to render the whole neighbourhood\r\nmore odorous than a perfumer's shop. The jessamine is seen in profusion\r\nin many parts, but principally on the hills; and there is also a\r\nbeautiful parasitical creeper (an æschynanthus), which grows, like the\r\nmistletoe, from the bark of other trees. It has a bright dark-green\r\nfleshy leaf, with brilliant scarlet flowers.\"\r\n\r\nThe same traveller describes a tree called the _dima_,[105] which,\r\nthough not very solid as food, adds much to the flavour of the\r\n_cuisine_. It has a large greenish shell, some nine inches long; inside\r\nof it lie a number of seeds, and attached to them by fibres a quantity\r\nof yellowish-white cakey powder, having a sweetish acid taste, and when\r\nmixed with water forming an agreeable beverage, somewhat resembling\r\nlemonade. The Abyssinians mix with it red pepper and salt, and eat it as\r\na relish with their bread. When the tree reaches a certain size, its\r\ntrunk almost always becomes hollow; and then it frequently contains a\r\nstore of wild honey, which may easily be obtained by means of a small\r\naxe and fire.\r\n\r\nMore to the south, in the Shoa, we meet with an almost analogous\r\nvegetation: the Socotrine Aloes (_Aloe socotrina_), which supplies our\r\nPharmacopoeia with an active cathartic, is particularly abundant. The\r\n_Celastrus edulis_,[106] a small branching shrub whose leaves possess\r\nvery similar properties to those of the Tea-plant, and are employed for\r\nthe same purpose by the Abyssinians, is widely cultivated. The Arabs\r\ndistil from them a stimulating drink called Kat. Nor should I forget the\r\nCousso, or Casso, named after its discoverer _Brayera anthelmintica_,[107]\r\nan infusion of whose bark or leaves forms one of the most powerful\r\nvermifuges in the world; and the _Musa ensete_, a magnificent banana,\r\nwith gigantic leaves and nerves of a vivid red, which now flourishes in\r\nour European plantations.\r\n\r\nAmong the cultivated plants may be included most of those which I have\r\nnoticed under the head of Senegambia; while, owing to the considerable\r\nelevation of the mountains, we find many others which belong to cool and\r\ntemperate climates--such, for example, as rye and barley. The Sugar\r\nCane, the Pomegranate, and numerous Aurantiaceæ, as, for example, the\r\nCitron and the Orange, have been likewise introduced into this part of\r\nSouthern Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN SOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\n1. Mesembryanthemum inflexum.\r\n2. Hottentot's Fig (_Mes. edule_).\r\n3. Euphorbia neriifolia.\r\n4. Euphorbia grandidens.\r\n5. Stapelia hirsuta.]\r\n\r\nFrom the coast of Aden, where almost complete sterility prevails prior\r\nto the rainy season--from the coast of Aden to Cape Guardafui, situated\r\nat the easternmost point of Africa, the traveller encounters a constant\r\nsuccession of mountains or elevated table-lands, haunted by the\r\nshepherds of the Somali tribes,--a people notorious for their\r\nbrigandage. Respecting the coast of Ajan we know but little, except\r\nthat its arid and sandy soil supports a scanty vegetation of stunted\r\nplants. The Zanguebar coast is not more familiar to the botanist, and is\r\nmainly covered with marshes.\r\n\r\nBut the littoral of Western Africa is gifted with a flora as luxuriant\r\nas it is varied. According to Dr. Welwitsch, who has explored this\r\nregion, previously almost a _terra incognita_ to Europeans, \"the special\r\nfeature in the neighbourhood of Benguela is the abundance of parasitical\r\n_Lorunthaceæ_, or mistletoe, on the thickets of the thorny Mimosa, to\r\nwhich are attached those Roccellæ (or Archils), the _Roccella tinctoria_\r\nand _R. fuciformis_, that yield so brilliant a lilac dye. In the gardens\r\nof Benguela the vegetables of Europe are most successfully cultivated,\r\nas well as a great number of fruit trees belonging both to tropical and\r\ntemperate climes: citron and orange, the olive, the cashew-nut, the\r\nanana, the fig, the vine, the pomegranate, the elais-palm, the banana,\r\nthe anona, and the corrossol. The vine bears grapes twice every year,\r\nand the crop on each occasion is abundant and of fine flavour. The\r\ngardens in the vicinity of Mossamèdes, between the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth parallels of south latitude, exhibit a curious medley of\r\nvegetables on every side, where you may see flourishing side by side the\r\nbanana and the potato, manioc and wheat, sugar-cane and flax, barley,\r\nand every kind of Spanish potato.\"\r\n\r\nA few miles from Cape Negro the coast rises for from 300 to 350 feet\r\nabove the sea-level, forming a continuous plateau, where the flora,\r\nthough meagre when compared with that a little further to the north,\r\noffers nevertheless to the traveller some objects of the highest\r\ninterest. It was here that Dr. Welwitsch met with the strange plant\r\nwhich, in commemoration of its intrepid discoverer, Sir William Hooker\r\nnamed _Welwitschia_,[108] but which the natives call _Tumboa_. \"In its\r\nyouth its two original cotyledonary leaves appear to grow considerably,\r\nand extend horizontally in opposite directions, raised but little above\r\nthe surface of the sand, whilst the intervening stock thickens and\r\nhardens, assuming an obconical shape, flat at the top, and rapidly\r\ntapering below into the descending root. As years go on, the original\r\npair of leaves, having attained their full size, and a hard, tough,\r\nfibrous consistence, do not die away, but gradually split up into\r\nshreds; the woody mass which bears them rises very little higher, but\r\nincreases horizontally both above and below the insertion of the leaves,\r\nso as to clasp their base in a deep marginal slit or cavity; and from\r\nthe upper side, at the base of the leaf, several short flowering stalks\r\nare annually developed. These are erect, dichotomously branched jointed\r\nstems, rising from six inches to a foot in height, and bearing a pair of\r\nsmall opposite scales at each fork or joint, each branch being\r\nterminated by an oblong cone, under the scales of which are the flowers\r\nand seeds. The result is, that the country is studded with these\r\nmisshapen table-like or anvil-like masses of wood, whose flat tops,\r\npitted with the scars of old flowering stems, never rise above a foot\r\nfrom the ground, but vary, according to age, in a horizontal diameter of\r\nfrom a few inches to five or six feet--those of about eighteen inches\r\ndiameter being supposed to be already above a hundred years old.\"[109]\r\n\r\nThese fantastic monstrous shapes were found by Dr. Welwitsch, with their\r\ndeeply-embedded roots, on the dry plateau of the Benguela coast, in 15°\r\n40´ south latitude. Herr Montein met with it in a perfectly similar\r\nsituation on quartzose soil, in the neighbourhood of the Nicolas River,\r\n14° 20´ south latitude; and Mr. Baines and Mr. Anderson, in Dawaraland,\r\nbetween 22° and 23° south latitude, in the neighbourhood of Whalefish\r\nBay, and in a district where never a drop of rain falls. We may\r\ntherefore place the _habitat_ of this remarkable plant between the 14th\r\nand 23rd parallels of south latitude. The crown, when divested of its\r\nleaves, bears a close resemblance to a fungus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE OF CAPE COLONY.\r\n\r\n1. Aloe verrucosa.\r\n2. Aloe soccotrina.\r\n3.

Pelargonium tricuspidatum.]\r\n\r\nIf we now approach the Cape of Good Hope--the Cabo del Tormentoso, or\r\n\"Cape of Storms,\" of the early navigators--we shall observe a\r\ncharacteristic vegetation peculiar to a solid or stony soil, sometimes\r\nhilly, but generally dry. It is in the desolate and barren steppes\r\nsituated within the confines of Caffraria that those splendid\r\nherbaceous bulbous plants display their beauties, which are now familiar\r\nto our English gardens under the names of Gladiolus, Oxalis, Ixia, and\r\nTulbaya. To those magnificent ornaments of the floral world we must add\r\nsome less known plants, remarkable in other respects; such as the\r\n_Mollugo cerviana_, which, with a few Ficoideæ, form the almost\r\nexclusive nourishment of the herbivorous animals belonging to these\r\ncountries. The Gramineæ are rare in the plains of Cape Colony, but, on\r\nthe other hand, they contain a number of oleaginous plants included in\r\ndivers families. Here, for instance, are those singular _Compositæ_,\r\nwhose stems so closely resemble waxen tapers; several Ficoideæ, of which\r\nsome species--as, notably, the _Mesembryanthemum edule_, or Hottentot's\r\nFig, distributed over the interior of Southern Africa, and the\r\n_Mesembryanthemum tuberosum_--are eagerly sought by the Hottentots,\r\nCaffres, and natives generally, who eat the fruits of the former and the\r\nroots of the latter; the _Stapelia hirsuta_, or Carrion Plant, and\r\nseveral others of the same genus, whose carrion-smelling flowers are\r\nsingularly handsome, though their odour is most offensive; a great\r\nnumber of aloes, particularly the _Aloe verrucosa_, _A. ciliaris_, _A.\r\nplicatilis_, and _A. arborescens_, each distinguished by a strange\r\nwayward boldness of form and figure; and, finally, those larger\r\nEuphorbias of which I have already spoken, and which yield a white milky\r\njuice that hardens on exposure to the air. It is mainly on the slopes or\r\nstony hills of the Cape that we meet with numerous and remarkable\r\nspecies of the Immortelles, with their white, yellow, or lilac, and\r\nsatin-smooth flowers. The woody Immortelle (_Helichrysum fruticosum_)\r\nis one of those peculiar to the Cape districts. It is in analogous but\r\nmore sandy localities that those graceful little shrubs, with varied\r\ncorollas, flourish, which are so popular in England under the name of\r\n_Ericas_, and which frequently exhibit the highest beauty of form and\r\ncolour. In the engraving is figured the exquisite _Erica Cavendishiana_,\r\na deservedly great favourite in our English conservatories. There, too,\r\nthe traveller delightedly examines the almost interminable succession of\r\nPelargoniums, or Geraniums, rich in clusters of delicate bloom, and in\r\nexquisitely green foliage. What a blank would their absence leave in our\r\nblossomy parterres! Here and there he notes dense coppices of the\r\nArduinia spinosa, the Lycium Afrum, the Euclæa ondulata, whose berries\r\nare eaten by the Hottentots; several species of Rhus,[110] among others\r\nthe _Rhus lucidum_; and, finally, a great number of the strange\r\nfantastic Proteaceæ, with their hard dry evergreen leaves and curiously\r\nbeautiful flowers. At the foot of the mountains, in the countries\r\nbordering on Caffraria, different Cycadaceæ are found, especially the\r\n_Zamia_ and _Encephalartus_, an elegant plant with a short spherical\r\ntrunk, surmounted by a crown of long rigid palmated leaves. The natives\r\nprepare with their pith a species of cake which they eat instead of\r\nbread. Ferns are not numerous at the Cape; the most remarkable,\r\nundoubtedly, is the _Todea Africana_. The hills and meadows of this part\r\nof South Africa do not always exhibit so marked an aridity; rivers and\r\nstreams refresh the soil, and there, where the current is not too swift\r\nnor the depth too great, grows the beautiful _Calla_ of Ethiopia, a\r\nspecies of Aroidea, whose snow-white fragrant flowers resemble a large\r\nhorn in shape; the _Aponogeton distachyum_, another aquatic plant, with\r\nwhite flowers and floating leaves, is not less common in similar\r\npositions; then on the banks, in fresh and shady nooks of greenery,\r\nthrives the _Strelitzia reginæ_, a gorgeous-flowered genus of _Musaceæ_,\r\nnamed after Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, queen of George III. The\r\nfoliage of this magnificent plant consists of long-stalked leaves\r\nsheathing at the base, arising from a contracted stem, the flower stalk\r\nencircled below by the sheath of the leaf-stalk; while from its upper\r\nportion springs a large bract or spathe placed obliquely, within which\r\nlie the flowers, resplendent in orange and purple.\r\n\r\nIn the Desert of Kalahari exists an abundant and varied vegetation.\r\nAccording to Dr. Livingstone, it is an immense plain which nourishes a\r\nprodigious quantity of herbaceous plants, generally of very small\r\nelevation, and besprinkled at intervals with thickets of bushy shrubs.\r\nThe herbs which are enabled to withstand the prolonged droughts of these\r\narid localities are species with tuberous roots, creeping or\r\nspindle-like, and deeply buried in the ground. The _Citrullus vulgaris_\r\nand _C. amarus_ are found in enormous quantities. Dr. Livingstone speaks\r\nof another individual of the gourd tribe, probably a kind of _Cucumis_,\r\nwhose fruits colour red when ripe, and which has sometimes a sweet and\r\nsometimes a bitter flavour. In these vast regions, where a desolating\r\naridity prevails, the rivers and streams dry up for a great portion of\r\nthe year, and the soil of their bed, generally black and loamy, is\r\nrapidly covered with a profuse vegetation, composed in great part of\r\ngrasses and rush-plants.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the rivers Mokolo and Zouga, and the shores of Lake Ngami,\r\nare covered with herbs and small thorny stunted bushes, including the\r\n_Acacia detinens_. In the south of Africa the soil is so dry that only\r\nplants of a fleshy consistency can endure the heat; elsewhere, in more\r\ntemperate climes, these latter plants are also very abundant, but the\r\nsurrounding herbage destroys them. Among those which grow there in great\r\nnumbers I may name the Ficoideæ, and particularly the _Mesembryanthemum\r\ninflexum_, which is very widely spread, and whose stems and leaves are\r\neaten by herbivorous animals. This plant, says Dr. Livingstone, is so\r\nuseful that it is cultivated by the Dutch Boers on an extensive scale.\r\nOn his northward route towards Linianty, this illustrious traveller fell\r\nin with meadows of such rank fertility that its herbage frequently rose\r\nabove his vehicles. The natives, designated Makalatos, show some\r\nagricultural taste and skill, and cultivate durra, maize, two kinds of\r\nbeans, arachides, pumpkins, and the like. Everywhere, along the banks of\r\nthe Gambye and the Liba, he met with exceptionally fertile land, where\r\nthe grasses attained an unusual development. On the Liba bloomed wide\r\nverdurous plains, consisting of plants with dazzling corollas and\r\ngramineæ of tall stature. Owing to the burning heats which blight these\r\ndistricts, herbaceous plants are developed with extraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nIn the rainy season the Liba meadows are covered, like our own, with an\r\nimmense variety of mushrooms, some nutritious, others poisonous. The\r\nformer are much relished by the natives. One of the most common, and\r\none of the finest flavour, is found, says Dr. Livingstone, on all the\r\nant-hills; it is completely white, very good even when eaten raw, and\r\nabout eight inches in diameter. There is another of a brilliant red or\r\nsuperb blue, but it is poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the Quilo, like those of the Quango, are endowed with a\r\nmost luxurious vegetation; the same is the case with the banks of the\r\nZambesi. Everywhere spreads a gigantic and abundant herbage. In the\r\nenvirons of the small town of Cassanga, the natives cultivate manioc,\r\npotatoes, haricots, tomatoes, &c. There are found also bananas and guava\r\nplants, and probably all the legumes and fruit trees recognized by Dr.\r\nWelwitsch at Benguela, which lies nearly under the same latitude. From\r\nthe table-land of Cassanga you may survey nearly the whole of the valley\r\nwatered by the Quango. It is a gently undulating plain, covered with\r\nherbs, and sown with great woods. The coffee-tree was formerly\r\ncultivated in the province of Tété, but has been abandoned; cassias,\r\nhowever, flourish, and indigo. Among the cultivated plants of Tété\r\nLivingstone, moreover, mentions some species which are not yet\r\nbotanically distinguished--such as the Loatsa (_Pennisetum typhoideum_),\r\nand several of the bean tribe, one of which grows underground like the\r\narachides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE LIFE IN THE PRAIRIES, PAMPAS, AND LLANOS OF THE NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the provinces, as yet uninhabited or only scantily peopled, which\r\ncompose the northern regions of the New World, none offer so vast an\r\nextent of prairies as that which is situated in the vicinity of the\r\nNeosho and the Vert-de-Gris, between the Missouri frontier and the River\r\nArkansas. Woods of small extent--or, more generally, limited patches of\r\ncopse and thicket--are met with at intervals in these plains. The\r\n_Smilax rotundifolia_, a species of sarsaparilla, with round leaves and\r\nsarmentous stems; the _Rhus toxicodendrum_, a shrub with a very\r\npoisonous juice; and the _Asimina triloba_, a plant bearing nutritious\r\nfruit, are, with a few other subfrutescent species, the denizens of\r\nthese lonely localities. Annual or perennial plants abound in the\r\nprairies, and attain there a considerable development, especially in the\r\nmore humid districts. The plains bordering on the Swan's Marsh, situated\r\nupon the upper course of the River Osage, nourish a great number of\r\nspecies, as elegant as they are varied. As in our own meadows, the\r\nGramineæ, the Cyperaceæ (or Sedges), the Leguminosæ, and the\r\nCompositæ--the latter especially--are very extensively diffused. But, in\r\ncontrast to the majority of our species, their representatives are in\r\ngeneral of remarkable dimensions, with flowers of extraordinary\r\nsplendour, and most of them have been naturalized in our British\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nThe American prairies, again, like the meadow-lands of Europe, are\r\nalternated with dry, gravelly spaces, marshes, swampy angles, and wooded\r\ntracts. It is curious to trace a certain likeness between the genera\r\nwhich inhabit these localities in both continents. Thus, M. Trécul, who\r\nexplored, in 1848 and 1849, nearly the whole of the State of Missouri to\r\nthe foot of the Rocky Mountains, Louisiana, Texas, and a part of\r\nNorthern Mexico, discovered in the vicinity of the Swan's Marsh,\r\nWater-Plantains (_Alisma_), Sagittarias, and Nymphæas, in the inundated\r\ndistricts; Characeæ--their tubular branches incrusted with carbonate of\r\nlime--bladder-plants, and the beautiful floating Naiadaceæ, in deeper\r\npools and stagnant waters; and the Lythraceæ (or Loose-Strife tribe) on\r\nthe banks of the brooklets. But the commonest aquatic plant in these\r\nmorasses, and that which conceals, so to speak, all the other plants\r\nproper to such localities, is the _Nelumbium calophyllum_, with its\r\nrose-coloured blossoms; its seeds and rhizomes are eaten by the natives.\r\n\r\nThe vast plains of Missouri are sufficiently fertile. Among the plants\r\nmost abundant in somewhat damp places we must notice several\r\n_Compositæ_; the _Liatris_, with their violet flowers and long spiky\r\nbunches, the _Calliopsis tinctoria_ of the dyers, the _Gaura_ of\r\nLindheimer, and the _Tripsacum dactyloides_. Asters, Erigerons,\r\nGaillardies, Helianthi (sun-flowers), Solidagos, the _Rudbeckia hirta_,\r\nand the _Coreopsis_, are found almost as far south as Texas. By the side\r\nof these _Compositæ_ flourish several _Desmodiums_ and _Cassias_, some\r\ngraceful _Baptisias_--with blue flowers and light green foliage, the\r\n_Melanthum Virginicum_, the _Euphorbia marginata_, the _Asclepias\r\nCornuti_--now naturalised in the neighbourhood of Paris--the _Hibiscus\r\npalustris_ and _H. moscheutos_, gigantic Malvaceæ, whose\r\nsplendidly-beautiful flowers are often three or four inches in diameter.\r\nAs plants widely spread in the stonier Prairies, we may note the Gauras,\r\ndifferent varieties of _OEnothera_, and especially the _Silphium\r\nlaciniatum_ (vulgarly called the Magnetic Plant, or Compass of the\r\nPrairies). Its leaves _are said_ to turn their faces uniformly east and\r\nwest, so that their edges are consequently directed due north and south.\r\nThe plant is also known as Pilot-weed, Polar-plant, Rosin-weed, and\r\nTurpentine-weed; the latter name derived from the copious resin exuded\r\nby its stems, which grow to a height of three to six feet, as well as by\r\nthe leaves, which are deeply pinnatified.\r\n\r\nIn the small woods which skirt the Prairies is found in abundance,\r\ntwining round the bushes, the _Apios tuberosa_, a leguminous plant\r\nformerly recommended to European cultivation on account of the rounded\r\ntubercles which grow upon its subterranean stems. The Arabians collect\r\nthem in the spring, and carefully dry them to eat for food. The Apios\r\nbelongs to the family of Umbelliferæ, and is consequently allied to\r\ncelery, parsnip, and carrot.\r\n\r\nIn Missouri, and as far as the confines of Mississippi, we also fall in\r\nwith very productive sandy plains alternating with wooded uplands. This\r\ncountry recalls, on the whole, the aspect of that which we have just\r\ndescribed, and the plants which thrive therein are almost the same.\r\n\r\nOn the hills and woody slopes in the neighbourhood of the Iron Mountain,\r\nwe likewise meet with sufficiently verdurous prairies. M. Trécul\r\ncollected there numerous Gramineæ, some species of Carex, Plantains,\r\nEuphorbias, Polygalas, and Vervains; many genera, in fact, which in\r\nFrance, and similar soils elsewhere, have numerous representatives. It\r\nis in the grassy tracts of the wooded districts that the larger species\r\nof _Phlox_ flourish, while the smaller varieties of the same genus\r\nvegetate upon the hills. The low humid meadows enchant us with their\r\ngorgeous scarlet _Actæas_,[111] their yellow Balsams their _Echinacea\r\npurpureas_, and their superb Lilies; those which are dry and rather\r\nstony are covered with the broad golden flowers of the gay _OEnothera\r\nmacrocarpa_.[112]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN THE AMERICAN PRAIRIES.\r\n\r\n1. Liatris squarrosa.      3. Asclepias Cornuti.\r\n2. Calliopsis tinctoria.   4. Tripsacum dactyloides.\r\n               5. Gaura Lindheimeri.]\r\n\r\nAmong the shrubs which people the marshy tracts of this same region, I\r\nmust point out the _Sassafras_, a kind of laurel with deciduous leaves,\r\nyellow flowers, which precede the foliage, and small dark-blue fruit.\r\nIt is found from Canada to Florida; a mere bush in the north, but a tree\r\nfifty feet high in the south. The wood is soft, light, of a coarse\r\nfibre, with a pungent aromatic taste, and a strong agreeable odour. The\r\nwood is brought to market in the shape of chips, but for medicinal\r\npurposes the thick spongy bark of the root is prepared, and it is found\r\nextremely valuable as a powerful stimulant, sodorific, and diuretic. The\r\nmucilaginous leaves are employed in thickening soup. An infusion of the\r\nbark or wood makes a pleasant beverage, formerly known as _Saloop_; and\r\nthe wood also yields an oil which is used medicinally.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the state of Texas, and especially near San Antonio de\r\nBejar, that those immense desert spaces commence which occupy all the\r\nnorthern region of Mexico. The southern districts of Texas offer in\r\ntheir prevailing landscapes a mixture of beautiful prairies and shady\r\nwoods. Among the plants peculiar to humid and turfy localities, I may\r\nparticularize the _Sarracenias_, a group of remarkable exogens, whose\r\nleaves are hollowed out into tubes or pitchers, open at the upper end,\r\nand streaked with bands of different colours; the Eriocaulons, a kind of\r\nrush, carrying their small flowers in spherical capitals on the summits\r\nof their tall branching stems; and the Nelumbios (_Nelumbium\r\ncalophyllum_), aquatic plants of unusual beauty, American congeners of\r\nthe celebrated Lotus, the \"insane root which takes the reason prisoner.\"\r\nThe nuts are wholesome and edible, and the root-stocks are also\r\noccasionally eaten. These plants are likewise found, in analogous\r\nhabitats, in Mississippi and Louisiana, accompanied by the light-green\r\nMagnolia, the Dog-berry tree of Florida, several Wax-berries, and the\r\nSassafras laurel, now acclimatized in Europe, and whose bark is employed\r\nas I have said, medicinally, while its wood and roots are made use of by\r\nturners and toy-manufacturers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN TEXAS.\r\n\r\n1. Nelumbium calophyllum.   3. Eriocaulon flavidulum.\r\n2. Sarracenia purpurea.     4. Laurus sassafras.]\r\n\r\nPrairies abound in Texas, wide rolling sweeps of grassy sward, with an\r\napparently interminable horizon, unbroken by rock, or wood, or\r\nriver--leagues upon leagues of rank thick grass where countless herds\r\nare depastured, and where the hunter still finds game worthy of his\r\ndeadly rifle. Among those which skirt the Bay of Matagorda, and extend\r\nin the vicinity of Victoria, Gonzalès, and Seguin, M. Trécul discovered\r\nan ample variety of Compositæ; of Gramineæ, more especially those\r\nbelonging to the generæ _Poa_, _Spartina_, _Dactyloctenium_; Cyperaceæ,\r\nEuphorbias, Cucumbers, and Gourds. From the Texan Prairies our European\r\ngardeners have of late years received a Graminea of the genus _Panicum_,\r\nthe _Black Mosquito Grass_, which by its long creeping rhizomes may be\r\nemployed with undoubted success to arrest the inland movement of the\r\nDunes and shifting sandy shores. The yellow water-lily (_Nuphar lutea_)\r\nspreads its fine leaves on the surface of the Texan streams, in\r\nbeautiful companionship with the _Nuphar advena_ and the _Nymphæa\r\nodorata_. In the same localities vegetates a weak variety of our\r\nEuropean _Sagittaria_, and the _Pistia spatulata_ spreads itself upon\r\nthe water, like our English Duckweed, both being members of the family\r\n_Pistaceæ_.\r\n\r\nAs far as New Braunfels, the Prairies are occasionally relieved by\r\nclumps of fine old trees; but below that point the traveller only\r\nencounters, and that at rare intervals, a few scarce coppices and scanty\r\nthickets. Growing more common at San Antonio de Bejar, they abound in\r\nthe region of Castroville, and spread over nearly the entire country to\r\nthe very borders of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese bushes or coppices mainly consist of the _Prosapis glandulosa_,\r\nthe _Guaiacum angustifolium_, the _Xanthoxylum inerme_ and a few\r\nAcacias.\r\n\r\nThe Guaiacum[113] is noticeable for its hard and heavy wood, generally\r\nknown as _Lignum Vitæ_, sometimes as _Guaiacum wood_, and occasionally\r\nas _Brazil wood_. It also yields a peculiar resinous product, which is\r\nmedicinally employed, in powder, pill, and tincture, for the relief of\r\nchronic rheumatism and chronic skin diseases. It is of a greenish-brown\r\ncolour, and though it has scarcely any taste, leaves a hot arid\r\nsensation in the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe _Xantoxyton_ type, of the order Xanthoxylaceæ, derives its name from\r\nthe yellowness of its timber. Its fruits have a pungent aromatic taste,\r\nlike pepper. The popular name of \"toothache tree\" is applied to some of\r\nthe American species, from the relief their bark and fruits are supposed\r\nto give in cases of that distressing affliction.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Castroville, Trécul found, profusely scattered\r\namong the thickets, a species of _Ephedra_, closely resembling the\r\n_Ephedra altissima_, whose feeble reed-like branches were literally\r\ncovered with small red fruits, producing a novel and attractive effect.\r\nAs a plant curious from its mode of vegetation, and which is spread in\r\nTexas as well as in Louisiana, I may mention the _Tillandria usneoides_,\r\nso named after Professor Tillands, of Abo. This is a genus of\r\n_Bromeliaceæ_, growing on the boughs of trees, and notably on those of\r\nthe evergreen oak. It hangs down like a tuft of long gray hair, in\r\nsomewhat the same fashion as certain lichens (_usnea_) in European\r\npine-forests, communicating to the trees a strange and positively weird\r\naspect. The plant is collected, and the outer cellular portion being\r\nremoved by soaking in water, the fibrous residuum is then employed to\r\nstuff cushions, mattresses, and pillows; whence it is sometimes called\r\n\"Vegetable horse-hair.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN THE TEXAN PRAIRIES.\r\n\r\n1. Yucca Tréculeana.            4. Echinocactus robustus.\r\n2. Silphium terebinthinaceum.   5. Cereus Peruvianus.\r\n3. Mamillaria rodantha.         6. Opuntia microdasys.]\r\n\r\nIn the thickets that dot the central Prairies commonly flourish the\r\n_Lantana Camara_, and the curious _Ungnandia speciosa_, a species of\r\nchestnut tree on a very reduced scale.\r\n\r\nIt was in Texas, and in the rocky, arid, and hilly plains, that the\r\nFrench botanist Trécul discovered several notable varieties of Yuccas,\r\nto one of which, a new, and certainly the most beautiful species, his\r\nname has very justly been affixed: the _Yucca Tréculeana_. It raises its\r\ntall panicle of gorgeous flowers from the centre of a crown of glossy,\r\nrigid, spear-like leaves, like a victorious trophy. In Eastern Texas we\r\nnote the first appearance, in the drier and stonier portions of the\r\nPrairies, of a representation of the family _Cactaceæ_, the _Opuntia\r\nfrutescens_, frequently growing side by side with the _Silphium\r\nterebinthinaceum_. The _Opuntia_ is more generally known as the \"Indian\r\nFig\" or \"Prickly Pear,\" from the large purple juicy fruits which it\r\nyields. The _Silphium_ belongs to the family of _Compositæ_. But Western\r\nTexas is the true birth-place of these oleaginous plants, some of which,\r\nsuch as the _Echinocactus robusta_, the _Mamillaria rodantha_, and the\r\n_Opuntia microdasys_ (\"small-thorny Opuntia\"), are cultivated in our\r\napartments, where they require but very little attention. M. Trécul has\r\ndiscovered in this region a new and rare variety of Echinocactus (_E.\r\nTréculeanus_), some kinds of Cereus, and, especially, the _Cereus\r\nPeruvianus_, a beautiful plant with large showy flowers.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal plants which, in North America, characterize the\r\nvegetation of the Prairies and the Savannahs. This rapid and condensed\r\ndescription will show the reader that the species most extensively\r\nspread belong to the genera in which are grouped the more common\r\ninhabitants of our own Old World meadows and grassy plains.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we now transport ourselves, on the poet's winged Pegasus, that takes\r\nno account of distance or of natural obstacles, to the Equatorial zone\r\nof the New World--into Guatemala, for example--we shall find the\r\nundulating and verdurous prairies giving place to high table-lands\r\nfurrowed by deep and romantic ravines. Their botanical interest,\r\nhowever, is trivial, and their vegetation of a meagre and stunted kind.\r\nBut between Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras, lies an extensive\r\nvalley, locally named _Llanora_, sown with numerous beautiful varieties\r\nof plants. Among them the _Gramineæ_ family predominates, and, without\r\nattaining the proportions and the quality of the herbs which we shall\r\nmeet with in the interior, form breadths of meadow very charming in\r\ntheir rare fresh greenness.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the Cordilleras, in the neighbourhood of Bogota, at\r\nan altitude of about 3200 feet, the eye surveys almost the entire extent\r\nof those vast level plains which stretch from the base of the\r\nmountain-chain to remote Brazil, Guiana, and Venezuela.\r\n\r\nThe Steppes comprised between Bogota and the river Meta are formed, in\r\ngeneral, of Gramineæ with crawling stems, and with nearly always very\r\ntall culms, especially in the cooler localities. Herbage is so abundant\r\nthat the traveller who penetrates into these immense pastures\r\nexperiences almost insurmountable difficulties. He himself and his horse\r\nare nearly hidden by the tall grasses, which frequently attain a stature\r\nof five to seven feet. And such is their vigour, that after having been\r\nburnt to the ground by one of the terrible conflagrations so frequent in\r\nthese countries, they spring up again with wondrous swiftness; if the\r\nplants had not flowered prior to the passage of the destructive flames,\r\nthey do so afterwards, and even when their leaves have been wholly\r\ndestroyed. The lofty table-lands of Bogota and Tukerres, in New Grenada,\r\npresent a succession of rich pasturages, perfumed by some species of\r\nLabiatæ, and notably by the _Micromeria Browniana_, which thrives among\r\nthe Gramineæ, their fodder is highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe barren and sandy plains of Peru, fertilized by the numerous\r\nwater-courses which furrow them, are covered with thick bloom and\r\nverdure in the rainy season. With the Gramineæ and Juncaceæ--the grasses\r\nand rushes common in these Steppes--mingle different members of the\r\nLiliaceæ family, and especially several kinds of Lily. The higher region\r\nof the eastern face of the Peruvian Cordillera, situated between 10,000\r\nand 13,000 feet of elevation, forms an immense undulating plateau\r\nwatered by the upper course of the Maranon. Everywhere, over a\r\nconsiderable area, the plains are clothed with a meagre vegetation, or\r\nalternate with wide morasses, lakes, and brooks. Among the plants which\r\npeople them is a species of the Gramineæ, _Stipa itchu_; and there are\r\nalso several Alpine varieties, Compositæ, Leguminosæ, and one of the\r\nCyperaceæ family, the _Cyperus articulatus_.\r\n\r\nThe Llanos of Caraccas, and of the Rio Apure and the Meta, over which\r\nroam immense herds of cattle, are, in the strictest sense of the term,\r\nsays Humboldt,[114] \"grassy plains.\" Their prevalent vegetation,\r\nbelonging to the two families of Cyperaceæ and Gramineæ, consists of\r\nvarious species of _Paspalum_, _P. leptostachyum_ and _P. linticulare_;\r\nof _Kyllingia_, of _Panicum_, _Anthephora_, _Aristida_, _Vilfa_, and\r\n_Anthistiria_. Only here and there are found, interspersed among the\r\nGramineæ, a few herbaceous dicotyledonous plants, consisting of two very\r\nlow-growing species of Mimosa (Sensitive Plant)--Mimosa intermedia and\r\nMimosa dormiens--which are great favourites with the wild horses and\r\ncattle. The natives give to this group of plants, which close their\r\ndelicate feathery leaves on being touched, the expressive name of\r\n_Dormideras_--\"sleepy plants.\" Nota tree is visible for miles; but where\r\nsolitary individuals occur, they are, in moist places, the Mauritia\r\nPalm; in arid districts, a Protacea--namely, the _Rhopula complicata_;\r\nalso the highly useful Palma da Corija, or de Sombrero; and our _Corypha\r\ninermis_, an umbrella palm, whose leaves are used to thatch the roofs of\r\nhuts.\r\n\r\nThe Mauritia palm, Palm Moriche, _Mauritia flexuosa_, Quiteve, or Ita\r\npalm--for by any or all of these names it is known--belongs to the\r\nfamily of _Lepidocaryeæ_. The trunk grows as high as 26 feet, but it\r\nprobably requires from 120 to 150 years to reach this height. It extends\r\nhigh up on the declivity of the Duida Mountains, and forms in moist\r\nplaces beautiful groups of a shining emerald verdure, like that of our\r\nEuropean alder groves. The trees preserve the humidity of the ground by\r\ntheir shade, and hence the Indians say that the Mauritia draws the water\r\nround its roots by a mysterious attraction. From its tops the Indians\r\nfrequently suspend their hammocks to escape the attacks of the\r\nmosquitoes.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh was the first who brought to England this fruit of\r\nthe Mauritia palm, which he very justly likened, on account of its\r\nscales, to a fir cone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN THE PLAINS OF THE META.\r\n\r\n1. Anthephora elegans.   3. Anthistiria ciliata.\r\n2. Panicum Cajennense.   4. Aristida capillacea.\r\n         5. Cyperus articulatus.]\r\n\r\nThe plains of the Rio Negro and the Amazons are the home and habitat of\r\nthe most remarkable of all aquatic plants, the _Victoria regia_,[115]\r\ntruly deserving its _royal_ rank on account of its curious conformation\r\nand splendid beauty. It is said to have been first observed by Häuke,\r\nabout 1801, and afterwards to have been noticed by Bonpland, D'Orbigny,\r\nand others; but the first person who accurately described it was\r\nPöppig, in 1832, who saw it in the river Amazons. Sir Richard\r\nSchomburgk, who discovered it in the rivers of Guiana, was, I believe,\r\nthe first to introduce it in England, where a splendid specimen may be\r\nseen at Kew, another at Chatsworth, and a third in the Botanic Garden of\r\nGlasgow. Its thick fleshy root-stocks send up a number of long\r\ncylindrical leaf-stalks, traversed by air canals, and armed with stout\r\nconical prickles. The blade of the leaf is circular, and floats on the\r\nsurface of the water; when fully developed, it measures from six to\r\ntwelve feet in diameter, and its margin being uniformly turned upwards\r\nto the depth of two or three inches, it assumes the appearance of a\r\nlarge shallow tray. The lower surface is traversed by a number of very\r\nprominent veins, radiating from the centre to the margin, and connected\r\nwith one another by smaller transverse nerves; so that the whole\r\nunder-side, which is of a purplish colour, is divided into a network of\r\nirregular quadrangular compartments or open cells, admirably fitting the\r\nleaf for floating on the water. The flowers rise upon prickly stalks.\r\nThey are more than a foot in diameter, with the white outer petals\r\ninclined downwards; while the central rose-coloured ones, with the\r\nstamens, remain erect: the whole presenting the fanciful appearance of a\r\ncentral rose-coloured crown resting on a circular range of snowy and\r\nmost gracefully curved petals. The fruit is a sort of globular capsule,\r\nabout the size of a child's head, and formidably beset with prickles.\r\nThe interior is fleshy, and divided into numerous cells, full of round\r\nfarinaceous seeds, which are eaten roasted by the Spaniards. Hence, in\r\nsome parts of South America, it is called _Maïs del Agua_, or Water\r\nMaize.\r\n\r\nThe pools and lagoons of this region nourish numerous other aquatic\r\nplants, among which it will suffice to particularize the _Scyndapsus\r\nfragrans_ and the _Raphia tædigera_.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the vast area of the Brazilian empire, we find it divided\r\ninto _matos_ (or woods) and _campos_ (or open plains). When the\r\ninhabitants would convert into cultivable land a district occupied by\r\nforest, they set fire to it during the dry season, and soon a vegetation\r\nof frutescent but dwarf species succeeds the primitive vegetation. By\r\nrenewing this purifying process a second and a third time, the soil\r\nfinally becomes covered with a species of fern closely resembling our\r\nlarge Pteris, _Pteris caudata_; and if the spot be once more abandoned,\r\nit is speedily taken possession of by a viscous, grayish, and foetid\r\nspecies of Gramineæ, well known locally by the name of _Capim gordura_,\r\nto botanists by that of _Tristegis glutinosa_. So boundless a voracity\r\nhas this plant, that it wholly expels from certain regions another and\r\nless tenacious variety of the Gramineæ, the _Saccharum_, or _Sapa_. The\r\n_Capim gordura_ constitutes in itself almost the entire flora of the\r\nartificial _campos_. It is but an indifferent fodder, and cattle derive\r\nfrom it little vigour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AQUATIC PLANTS OF GUIANA.\r\n\r\n1. Victoria regia.   2. Raphia tædigera.   3. Scyndapsus fragrans.]\r\n\r\nIn general, the natural _campos_ bear a certain resemblance to our\r\nmeadows; grass, however, is less abundant; they consist, especially in\r\nthe colder localities, of Gramineæ which do not, perhaps, exceed our\r\nBritish species in dimensions, but differ greatly in the size of their\r\nleaves, and often also in their spreading inflorescence. By their side,\r\nas is the case with us, grow other plants of a more graceful floral\r\ncharacter. Among these are Myrtaceæ, Melastomaceæ, with their capsular\r\nfruits, and a species of Compositæ, called _Veronia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN THE PAMPAS.\r\n\r\nPampas Grass (_Gynerium argenteum_).]\r\n\r\nThe wayfarer who traverses the sterile campos is astonished to discover,\r\non the tortuous and stunted trees that grow there at rare intervals,\r\nsome flowers of a singular loveliness. Yet who can refuse his admiration\r\nfrom the gorgeous Vochyaceæ; the Malpighiaceæ, richly and handsomely\r\nflowered; the Leguminosæ, with their long hanging clusters of sparkling\r\nblossoms; the trumpet-shaped flowers of the Bignonias, and the superb\r\n_Oochnus_? Nor will he forget a rare _Salvertia_, fragrant as the lily\r\nof the valley, and with its blossoms disposed in thyrses which outvie in\r\nbeauty those of the chestnut.\r\n\r\nIn the genial smiling country which extends from Monte Video to the\r\nmouth of the Rio Negro, the vegetation is almost wholly confined to\r\nGramineæ. It is in this region that the feathery Pampas Grass (_Gynerium\r\nargenteum_) flourishes luxuriantly, covering leagues upon leagues with\r\nits silvery panicles and drooping leaves, which, when stirred by a\r\ngentle wind, ripple like the slow-moving, spray-gleaming waters of a\r\nsunny sea. It has become of late years a favourite ornament of our\r\nBritish gardens, and may justly be taken as a type of tender\r\nloveliness.[116] Beyond the Rio Negro the country puts on a wilder\r\naspect, and it is with difficulty the most adventurous botanist can\r\npenetrate into its recesses.\r\n\r\nNearly all the southern districts of Patagonia form, as we have already\r\nseen, an immense and almost level plain, whose soil is generally dry,\r\narid, and impeded with large pebbles; the northern districts, on the\r\nother hand, offer a less monotonous landscape, are broken up with rocks\r\nand ravines, interspersed among tolerably fertile pastures, whose flora\r\nhas not yet been fully investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FLORA OF THE AUSTRALIAN PLAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Deserts of the Australian interior have been laboriously traversed,\r\nnot, as we have seen, without much suffering, and even sacrifice, by a\r\nhandful of intrepid travellers, who have proposed to themselves simply\r\nthe solution of certain geographical problems. It will therefore be\r\nunderstood that we owe to them only a few incidental notices of their\r\nbotanical features. For an accurate examination of these the pioneers of\r\ncommerce have neither the means, the opportunities, nor the requisite\r\nscientific knowledge. As far as its flora is concerned, the Australian\r\ninterior is wholly \"virgin soil,\" a new botanical world, perhaps,\r\nawaiting the advent of a Columbus. Only the littoral districts have been\r\nsatisfactorily explored; and here, in the south, we meet with the names\r\nof Labillardière, Robert Brown, Gaudichaud, D'Urville, Sieber, Lesson,\r\nCunningham, and other eminent botanists. To these celebrated names we\r\nmust also add those of Dr. Mueller, Director of the Botanical Gardens at\r\nMelbourne, Sir William Hooker, and Mr. Bentham. Their united labours\r\nhave provided the public with a vast amount of curious and authentic\r\ninformation, and have established the fact that the botany of New\r\nHolland, like its zoology, has a physiognomy peculiarly its own, and\r\nthat many, nay, most of its vegetable species, are not less\r\ncharacteristic than its strange and astonishing animal types. One is\r\nalmost tempted to adopt in sober earnest what Sydney Smith said in\r\nhumorous exaggeration, that, \"in this remote part of the earth, Nature\r\n(having made horses, oxen, ducks, geese, oaks, elms, and all regular and\r\nuseful productions for the rest of the world) seems determined to have a\r\nbit of play, and to amuse herself as she pleases.\"[117] Undoubtedly she\r\nhas indulged in the most wayward and eccentric forms. If there exist any\r\nrelations between the vegetation of Australia and that of any other part\r\nof the globe, it is certainly with the districts of Southern Africa\r\nwhich lie near the Cape of Good Hope that Australia exhibits the\r\ngreatest affinity. It would seem as if these two continents in some\r\nremote age had not been separated, as they now are, by \"leagues of salt\r\nwater,\" but that their vegetable species had been able to propagate\r\nthemselves freely from the one to the other.\r\n\r\nAccording to Richard, the approximative number of species distinguished\r\nby botanists amounts to about five thousand; but so many discoveries\r\nhave been made of later years, that we may raise the estimate to seven\r\nthousand. While the Australian plants are distributed among numerous\r\nfamilies, each of the latter comprises but a very limited number of\r\nindividuals. The predominant plants belong, in the main, to these\r\nfamilies or orders:--Leguminosæ, Compositæ, Myrtaceæ, Gramineæ,\r\nCyperaceæ, Filices, Proteaceæ, Epacridæ, Orchidaceæ, in a proportion\r\nwhich varies, moreover, according to the various districts explored.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of the soil, and the climatic conditions of the southern\r\nshores of the Australian continent, are highly favourable to the\r\nintroduction of new species. Our English settlers have availed\r\nthemselves to the utmost of this circumstance, and have cultivated on a\r\nlarge scale all the most useful fruit trees and vegetables of Europe,\r\nand others imported from tropical climes; so that mingled in the same\r\nprolific gardens may be seen the fig-tree and the banana, the guava, the\r\norange-tree, the olive, and the apple--cabbages, potatoes, turnips,\r\npeas. Even the vine has been successfully naturalized, and its\r\nmanufactured products are not inferior in excellence to the famous\r\nRhenish wines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE IN VICTORIA.\r\n\r\n1. Rosea gracilis (_Arundo conspicua_).   3. Hectia Pitcairniæfolia.\r\n2. Astelia Banksii.                            4. Xanthorrhoea arborea.]\r\n\r\nIn indicating the most curious indigenous plants of New Holland, we\r\nshall more particularly confine ourselves to those of Victoria, one of\r\nthe best known districts, and perhaps also one of the most extensive,\r\nmost diversified, and most picturesque. The plains are, in general,\r\nsufficiently grassy and fertile, especially in those parts which border\r\non the brooks and rivers. The plants most extensively distributed belong\r\nto the Gramineæ and Cyperaceæ; we find, among the former, the\r\n_Pennisetum fasciculare_, a great number of Poaceæ, and the _Arundo\r\nconspicua_; in foliage and general appearance the latter presents some\r\nstriking analogies with the Pampas Grass; among the Poaceæ predominates\r\nthe _Cyperus vaginatus_, a common object on the banks of the river\r\nMurray in those parts which are subject to frequent inundations. A\r\nstrong tenacious netting is made from the fibres of its leaves. To these\r\nherbs we have to add some flowering plants, such as the star-like\r\n_Lobelias_; numerous species of mint (as _Mentha Australis_, _M.\r\nsatureioides_, _M. grandiflora_, and _M. gracilis_), from which an\r\nessential oil is extracted for use in the manufacture of perfumes; the\r\n_Sida pulchella_ and _Lavatera plebeia_, of which stout fibre or solid\r\nthread is made, the fibres of Australian flax (_Linum marginale_) being\r\nadapted to the same purpose. The _Restias_, a curious rush-like order of\r\nendogens, also inhabit these moist places: as do the Kingias, very\r\ncommon grasses; the _Astelia Banksii_, a species of Liliaceæ, with\r\ngrass-formed leaves and a strong tenacious stem; and the _Xerotes\r\nlongifolia_. The Nardoo (_Narsilia macropus_, or, as it is sometimes\r\ncalled, _N. salvatrix_), whose spores and spore-cases are pounded by the\r\nnative Australians and made into bread or porridge, is a kind of\r\ncryptogamous plant, with leaves formed of four folioles, like those of a\r\ntruffle. It abounds in the low grounds and inundated districts,\r\nespecially on the banks of the Murray. Finally, the Stag-horn\r\n(_Acrostichon grande_), a gigantic mushroom, clings to the branches of\r\nthe great trees.\r\n\r\nSmall bushy clumps are scattered over the plains, and flourish with\r\npeculiar vigour along the water-courses. They consist of various shrubs.\r\nThe traveller will not fail to notice a whole series of\r\nLeguminosæ--_Chlorozoma_, _Pultenæa_, _Viminaria_, _Mirbelia_,\r\n_Podolobium_ (all are shrubs of exceeding elegance, and now form the\r\nrare ornaments of our English gardens); of Epacridæ--_Epacris\r\nstiphelia_, _E. leucophogon_, and others, which have also been imported\r\ninto our home-parterres; a great number of Euribias, a genus of\r\nsubfrutescent Compositæ, of which a few are rendered interesting by\r\ntheir heathlike foliage; the _Pimelea axiflora_, whose supple and\r\ntenacious bark is fashioned into bands and straps; the _Myrsine\r\nvariabilis_, with its woody stems and drupaceous fruit; the _Aralia\r\ncrassifolia_, a singular shrub, with long, narrow, and very rigid\r\nleaves; the _Callistemon salignum_ (vulgarly called \"stonewood\"),\r\nemployed for xylographic purposes; the _Casuarina equisetifolia_,[118]\r\nor \"Swamp Oak\"--also called \"Cassowary Tree\"--a lofty tree, with very\r\ndurable wood, long, slender, drooping, emerald-green branches, and\r\nconical fruit, inclosing small winged nuts; various species of\r\nMelaleuca, yielding the green aromatic oil called cajaputi or cajeput\r\noil, valuable as a stimulant or antispasmodic; finally, some Cordylines,\r\nor Tis, plants of the natural order Liliaceæ, and nearly allied to the\r\nDragon's Blood Tree, attaining a height of ten to fifteen feet, with a\r\nberry-like fruit, and lanceolate leaves of a reddish hue, which afford a\r\nnutriment for cattle, thatch for houses, and whose fibres are frequently\r\nmade into cloth. The root, when baked, is much used as an article of\r\nfood, and the fermented juice yields an intoxicating beverage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE ON THE AUSTRALIAN PLAINS.\r\n\r\n1. Doryanthes excelsa.\r\n2. Aralia crassifolia.\r\n3. Dryandra repens.\r\n4. Cordyline congesta.]\r\n\r\nThe dry, rocky, arid, and sandy districts, which may be compared to the\r\nLandes of Brittany, are clothed with a peculiar vegetation. The\r\nstrangest plant, which is also the most widely distributed, is\r\nundoubtedly the _Xanthorrhoea arborea_,[119] forming a conspicuous\r\nfeature in the dreary landscape, and when stripped of its leaves\r\nresembling a black man holding a spear. The leaves afford good fodder\r\nfor cattle, while the natives eat the soft white centre of the top of\r\nthe stem. They yield two kinds of fragrant resin--one of a yellow\r\ncolour, balsamic and inodorous, called Botany Bay; and the other red,\r\ncalled Black Boy Gum. The tree--which the settlers have christened\r\n\"Black Boy\" and \"Grass Gum\"--has a thick trunk, encrusted in a thick\r\ncoating of the persistent basis of old leaves, glued together by the\r\nyellow or red resin with which the plant abounds, and usually burned and\r\nblackened outside by bush-fires. The leaves are long, wiry, and\r\ngrass-like, and are borne in a dense tuft at the top of the stem,\r\nhanging gracefully all around it. Their long flower-stalks aspire from\r\nits centre, sometimes growing as high as fifteen or twenty feet, and\r\ncarrying aloft a thick cylindrical flower spike.\r\n\r\nAmong the lowlier plants are found a few Hectias, such as the _Hectia\r\nPitcairniæfolia_, one of the Bromelias, very curious from its mode of\r\nvegetation; and the _Stipa crinita_, a very common grass. The leaves of\r\nthe latter have been manufactured into paper of tolerable consistency.\r\n\r\nThe sandy and colder tracts are the habitat of the annual or perennial\r\nCompositæ, distinguished by their smooth and shining flowers. On the\r\nother hand, the dry rocky surfaces are besprinkled with inconsiderable\r\nwoods, or rather thickets, formed in part of the _Santalum acuminatum_,\r\nwhose nutritious fruit are called \"peaches\" by the colonists; the\r\n_Santalum persicarium_, or sandal wood; several _Nitrarias_,[120] with\r\nedible fruits; a great number of Acacias, notably the _Acacia\r\nverticillata_, _A. sophora_, and _A. doratoxylon_, whose very hard wood\r\nis employed in the fabrication of javelins; a considerable series of\r\nProteaceæ, particularly the _Banksia Australis_, _B. serrata_, and _B.\r\nintegrifolia_, so characteristic in aspect and foliage; and a few\r\n_Eucalypti_,[121] or \"Gum Trees,\" of small stature--among others, the\r\n\"Traveller's Tree,\" or _Eucalyptus oleosa_.[122] Its roots extend\r\nhorizontally, and retain a quantity of water sufficient to quench the\r\nwayfarer's thirst in the hour of need. All the Eucalypti are curious\r\ntrees, with entire and leathery leaves, affording an unusual amount of\r\naromatic oil. Many of the species abound in resinous secretions; some\r\nattain a great size, with trunks of from 8 to 16 feet in diameter, and\r\n150 or 160 in length. The _Eucalyptus resinifera_--\"Red Gum\" or \"Iron\r\nBark Tree\"--reaches to an elevation of 150 to 200 feet. When wounded, a\r\nred juice flows from it very freely, hardening into irregular,\r\ninodorous, and transparent masses in the air, and furnishing as much as\r\nsixty gallons from a single tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETABLE LIFE ON THE AUSTRALIAN PLAINS.\r\n\r\n1. Acacia verticillata.\r\n2. Casuarina equisetifolia, or \"Black Boy Tree.\"\r\n3. Corypha Australis, or \"Australian Palm.\"]\r\n\r\nFinally, I may refer to the _Dryandra_, whose foliage is very graceful,\r\nand its conformation very varied. Sometimes it is found as a bush, three\r\nto seven feet high; and sometimes, as in the _Dryandra repens_, creeping\r\nalong the ground.\r\n\r\nOn the more temperate heights the traveller encounters some plants of a\r\nfantastic character: as, for instance, the _Doryanthes excelsa_, with\r\nits upright gigantic leaves, more than 6 feet long, and from 2½ to\r\n3½ inches broad; from their centre rises a strong stalk, 15 or 18\r\nfeet high, terminated by a compact and voluminous cluster of great\r\ndeep-red flowers. There, too, are found the magnificent arborescent\r\nferns, _Alsophila Australis_ and _Dicksonia Antarctica_. The trunk of\r\nthe former aspires to a stature of 25 to 90 feet; that of the second, to\r\n12 to 28 feet; and in both the stems are terminated by a cluster of\r\nimmense flowers, which give to these plants a quite distinctive\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nNor must we quit the Australian Flora and its marvels without alluding\r\nto the _Corypha Australis_, which begins to make its appearance at the\r\nmouth of the Snowy River. It is a gigantic palm, growing solitarily, or\r\nin thin groups, in low, cool, and even moist places. Its trunk probably\r\nattains to 140 feet in height; and the top of its stem is crowned by a\r\ngorgeous crest of fan-shaped leaves, which are employed in the\r\nmanufacture of straw hats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE PRAIRIES OF THE OLD WORLD:--HERBIVOROUS ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the prodigal Flora of the Tropics, which we shall soon see displaying\r\nin the virgin forests its exuberant fecundity, corresponds a Fauna no\r\nless rich, and marked by a singular variety.\r\n\r\nThis Fauna offers, especially in the Old World, an impressive character\r\nof power, strength, superior force--I had almost said, _majesty_. In\r\ntruth, if we do calmly compare the mammals and the birds of tropical\r\nAmerica with those which roam the wild plains of Africa, Hindostan, the\r\nIndo-Chinese peninsula, and the great islands of the Indian Ocean, we\r\ncannot but recognize the evident superiority of the latter. The\r\nanthropoid Ape, the enormous Pachyderms, Elephant, Rhinoceros,\r\nHippopotamus, Giraffe, and, among animals of the same order, the\r\nAntelopes, many of which attain the dimensions of the Horse, belong\r\nexclusively to the Eastern Hemisphere. The genus Camel, represented in\r\nAsia by the Bactrian Camel, in Africa by the Dromedary, is but weakly\r\ntypified in South America by the Lama, the Vicuña, and the Alpaca, not\r\ninelegant in form, but of a markedly inferior stature. And what equality\r\nis there between the lordly Tiger of the rank Indian jungles, and the\r\nsleek, stealthy Jaguar of the American wilderness? Or who will venture\r\nto compare the so-called \"Lion of America,\" the Puma or Cougouar, with\r\nthe regal quadruped which makes the hot Libyan wastes re-echo with his\r\nterrible roar?\r\n\r\nAmong the Birds, the Phenicoptera, with its disproportionate legs and\r\nneck, distributed over all the ancient continent below 40° of latitude,\r\nand the Ostrich, properly so called, are much superior in dimensions to\r\ntheir analogues on the other side of the Atlantic, the American Flamingo\r\nand the Nandou. So do the Eagles and Vultures of Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica prevail in numbers and force over those of the New World. And the\r\nancient continent can likewise claim as its own the gigantic Epiornis,\r\nthe wonderful \"Roc Bird\" of the well-known Oriental legend, whose\r\npetrified eggs and some of whose fossil bones have been discovered in\r\nMadagascar. It is true, however, that the greatest of living Raptores,\r\nthe Condor, inhabits exclusively the Cordillera of the Andes:--\r\n\r\n    \"Stands solitary, stands immovable\r\n     Upon some highest cliff, and rolls his eye,\r\n     Clear, constant, unobservant, unabashed,\r\n     In the cold light, above the dews of morn.\"--(_W. S. Landor._)\r\n\r\nBut the balance is re-established by the Erpetological and Entomological\r\nFauna of the New World, which can oppose its huge Boas, its Caïmans and\r\nPythons, to the Crocodiles and Gavials of Africa and Asia; its Crotali\r\nand Trigonocephali to the Najas of India, the Echidnas of the Cape, and\r\nthe Cerastes of Egypt and the Sahara; while the Bull Frog of the United\r\nStates and the Pipa of Guiana are only found on the banks of the vast\r\nlonesome swamps of the new continent. As far as the Desert World is\r\nconcerned, in both hemispheres the legions are innumerable, and their\r\nenergies commensurate to the greatness of the continual work of\r\ndestruction and purification which they seem destined to accomplish in\r\nall tropical countries.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to carry any further the parallel between the two\r\nhemispheres. We shall more clearly detect their analogies and\r\ndifferences by pursuing the study, already opened up in the Steppes and\r\nSeas of Sand, of the principal species proper to the various forms of\r\nthe Desert, the different regions and divisions of the Savage World.\r\n\r\nYet I must confess that the difficulties of the study increase with the\r\nextent of the field we are called upon to explore. The Steppes and\r\nWildernesses of Sand constitute, both in Africa and Asia, regions which\r\nare clearly defined, and the poverty both of their fauna and their flora\r\nfixes a definite limit to the researches of the naturalist. Such is not\r\nthe case in the immense countries which now lie before us. Instead of\r\nsighing, like Alexander, for more worlds to conquer, the student of\r\nscience is ever deploring the impossibility of exhausting even a single\r\ndivision of the grand work before him. \"Art is long; life is short.\" The\r\nmost industrious among us can never rise to the full height of his\r\nglorious task; must always remain like a child on the shore of the ocean\r\nof truth, and be content with the few shells his nerveless hand\r\ncontrives to gather. In the wide regions we are about to traverse we\r\nfeel at every step the colossal character of the enterprise. Every\r\ninstant their aspect changes; Nature never repeats herself; their\r\nproducts vary with the latitude, the climate, and the soil. To pass in\r\nreview all the trees and plants and flowers which flourish there, all\r\nthe animals and peoples which dwell among them, would be nothing less\r\nthan to embrace in a vast encyclopædia the description and history of\r\ntwo organic kingdoms. But such is not the design of the present volume.\r\nI have not undertaken to give an exact picture of nature, which would\r\ntask to the uttermost the powers of men of such diverse genius as\r\nHumboldt, Owen, Lyell, Darwin, Tyndall, Hooker, and Ruskin, but to\r\nsketch the bold outlines and more prominent features of the physiognomy\r\nof the Desert World, and not to reproduce its more minute details.\r\n\r\nMy embarrassment, then, arises less from the multitude and infinite\r\nvariety of the objects we have to examine, than from the difficulty of\r\nharmonizing the study with the divisions of this work. How, in fact, can\r\nI establish a positive distinction between the animals of the Prairies\r\nor the Savannahs and those of the Forests, between those of the latter\r\nand the animals proper to the Mountains? For such a purpose it is\r\nneedful that each of these forms of the Desert World should possess its\r\npeculiar fauna; which is true only within very narrow limits. In\r\nreality, most animals inhabit or frequent, according to circumstances,\r\nsometimes one district, sometimes another, without its being possible to\r\nassign with any amount of precision their habitual, or simply their\r\noccasional, abode.\r\n\r\nI shall avail myself, therefore, of the liberty allowed to every writer\r\nwho does not design a purely didactical work, by not unnecessarily\r\ntroubling myself whether the animals whose organization or\r\ncharacteristics attract our notice, particularly affect a low or\r\nelevated locality, the shady wood or open plain, the pestilential swamp\r\nor the river-watered valley, and by permitting myself, except in the\r\ncase of some evident and constant partiality, to place them where the\r\nmost eminent observers assure us they are really, if not exclusively,\r\nmet with.\r\n\r\nOn this account, the plains, more or less densely wooded and broken up,\r\nwhich occupy the greater portion of the African Continent, will readily\r\nfurnish us with the opportunity of studying the majority of animals\r\nindigenous to that continent, and, in general, to the entire Tropical\r\nzone of the Old World. In fact, nearly all the genera of Mammals, Birds,\r\nand Reptiles, are there represented by their most characteristic types.\r\nClothed with a luxuriant vegetation; watered by periodical rains and\r\nnumerous streams; intersected by thick masses of forests, groves, and\r\nthickets; relieved from monotonous uniformity by mountain and ravine, by\r\nmarshes and lakes of vast extent,--these fields ever exhibit that aspect\r\nof busy life under which we love to represent to ourselves the earth\r\nwhen she first emerged from the boiling seas of Chaos, when the forces\r\nwhich had seethed within her bowels for so many thousands of centuries\r\nhad been tranquillized by the Divine will, and she was despatched on her\r\nmysterious course to be the theatre of man's glorious destiny.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the daytime silence and solitude prevail over the open plains. It\r\nis the hour when most animals seek, under the foliage of the trees,\r\namong the tall rank grasses, in the bosom of the waters or under the\r\nsurface of the earth, a shelter against the swift burning arrows of the\r\nsun, and repose immovable in their different lairs. But when the great\r\norb of day sinks towards the horizon, all Nature seems to awake. More\r\nimperious needs succeed to those of rest and slumber; hunger and thirst\r\nstimulate the most sluggish into exertion. Then the reptile begins to\r\nstir in the mud where he lay embedded; the herbivora return to their\r\nfresh pastures, and move towards the rivers and ponds in whose waters\r\nthey may slake their thirst; the carnaria take the same road; they know\r\nthat in the open plain they will find victims for their murderous jaws.\r\nThe Desert is astir with strange sounds and mysterious voices; the air\r\nre-echoes the thousand discordant cries which ring from the mountains\r\nand the rocks; black shadows pass, re-pass, and flit to and fro, in\r\nevery direction; terror, rage, agony, voracity, all these instincts\r\nobtain expression in the dreadful concert; it is the orgie of the\r\nappetites, the grand \"Witches' Sabbath\" of Nature, whose furious\r\nanimation slackens towards the middle of the night, until, at sunrise,\r\nthe lively accents and joyous melodies of the birds, and the peaceful\r\npastimes of the other animals of the day, succeed to the lamentations\r\nand sinister invocations of the prowlers of the darkness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIPPOPOTAMUS AND CROCODILE OF THE RIVER NILE.]\r\n\r\nIn the foremost rank of the great animals to which the fauna of Asia and\r\nAfrica owes its superiority, I have named the huge Pachyderms,[123]\r\nthose mighty colossi which may be regarded as the analogues, in the\r\nterrestrial creation, of the Cetacean giants of the marine creation. The\r\nPachyderms formed in Cuvier's system a sufficiently natural order, which\r\nmodern systematists have dismembered, and, as I believe, a little\r\narbitrarily. This order comprised, besides the elephants, the\r\nhippopotami, the rhinoceroses, and the tapirs, all the Porcidæ family,\r\nand even the Solidungulates, such as the horse and ass. In the present\r\nwork I shall adopt Cuvier's division. The elephant is the denizen of the\r\nforests where, in a succeeding chapter, we shall encounter both him and\r\nthe rhinoceros. But the hippopotamus belongs incontestably to the fauna\r\nof the plain. His name (from the Greek) signifies \"River Horse.\" And,\r\nindeed, he lives in the rivers, the pools, the deep marshes; his manners\r\nare essentially amphibious. He dives and swims with a surprising ease\r\nand agility, considering the enormous bulk of his body, and the\r\nshortness of his heavy, unwieldy legs. He is able to remain a long time\r\nunder water. His colour is a brownish-black, and his proportions, ten to\r\ntwelve feet in length, and eight to ten in height. His head is\r\nimmensely large; the mouth cavernous in its prodigious width; the teeth\r\nimmensely strong, the incisors and canines of the lower jaw being long,\r\nand curved forwards; these canines or tusks sometimes measure more than\r\ntwo feet in length, and weigh upwards of six pounds each. Those in the\r\nupper jaw are much smaller, and the front teeth are of a moderate size.\r\nThe broad thick lips are beset with scattered tufts of short bristles;\r\nthe small quick eyes are placed very near the top of the head; the small\r\nears are slightly pointed, and lined with short thick hair. His food\r\nmainly consists of the coarse herbage that flourishes on the banks of\r\nlakes and rivers; but Milne Edwards speaks of three or four of them\r\nstanding knee-deep in the water, forming an irregular line, and pouncing\r\nupon the fish brought within their reach by the rapid currents. At night\r\ntime they abandon their watery haunts to prowl among the sugar-cane\r\nplantations, the fields of millet and rice, which they devour with\r\neagerness. Their march is so impetuous, that they break down every\r\nbarrier; nothing can resist them.\r\n\r\nThe hippopotamus is spread over all eastern and southern Africa; is\r\nfound in Nubia, Ethiopia, Abyssinia; at the Cape, the Senegal and the\r\nCongo. Both the settlers and the natives of these countries hunt them\r\nwith ardour for the sake of the ivory they yield, nor is their flesh\r\ndespised by a keen appetite and vigorous stomach. Sometimes they\r\nexcavate, in the animal's ordinary route, a tolerably deep pit, beset\r\nwith sharp pointed poles, and concealed by a covering of leafy branches:\r\nsometimes, in the shade of the evening, they lie in ambuscade among the\r\nbushes, and aim at his huge bulk the deadly bullet, as he comes up from\r\nthe water, labouring and bellowing. It is necessary to aim well at his\r\nhead; for the rest of his body is almost as invulnerable as that of\r\nAchilles.\r\n\r\nHere is a lively picture from Sir Samuel Baker's valuable volumes, in\r\nwhich the hippopotamus is a foremost figure.\r\n\r\n\"We were towing through high reeds,\" he says,[124] \"the men invisible,\r\nand the rope mowing over the high tops of the grass, when the noise\r\ndisturbed a hippopotamus from his slumber, and he was immediately\r\nperceived close to the boat. He was about half-grown, and in an instant\r\nabout twenty men jumped into the water in search of him, thinking him a\r\nmere baby; but as he suddenly appeared, and was about three times as\r\nlarge as they had expected, they were not very eager to close. However\r\nthe reis pluckily led the way, and seized him by the hind leg, when the\r\ncrowd of men rushed in, and we had a grand tussle. Ropes were thrown\r\nfrom the vessel, and nooses were quickly slipped over his head; but he\r\nhad the best of the struggle, and was dragging the people into the open\r\nriver; I was therefore obliged to end the sport by putting a ball\r\nthrough his head. He was scored all over by the tusks of some other\r\nhippopotamus that had been bullying him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter conquering your enemy, kill him and eat him: such is the maxim of\r\nsavage life. It was carried out by Sir Samuel Baker and his men, much to\r\nthe satisfaction of the conquerors. \"A new dish!\" exclaims our\r\ntraveller; \"there is no longer mock-turtle soup; _real_ turtle is _mock_\r\nhippopotamus. I tried boiling the fat, flesh, and skin together, the\r\nresult being that the skin assumes the appearance of the green fat of\r\nthe turtle, but is far superior. A piece of the head thus boiled, and\r\nthen soused in vinegar, with chopped onions, cayenne pepper, and salt,\r\nthrows brawn completely in the shade.\"\r\n\r\nThe same traveller relates that the natives on the shores of the Albert\r\nN'yanza, previous to embarking on a voyage, cast a handful of beads into\r\nthe lake, to propitiate the hippopotamus, that their canoe may not be\r\nupset.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Tapir_ is wanting in Africa; but we find a species, _Tapirus\r\nIndicus_, in India and the Indian Archipelago, where it was first\r\nnoticed by Diard and Duvaucel. These naturalists saw an individual of\r\nthis species at Barrackpore, near Calcutta, whither he had been imported\r\nfrom the island of Sumatra. \"I was much surprised,\" says Diard, \"that so\r\nlarge an animal had not hitherto been discovered; but I was much more\r\nso, on seeing in the Asiatic Society's Museum the head of a similar\r\nanimal, a native of Malacca, which had been sent to the Society, on the\r\n29th of April 1806, by M. Faghuarie, governor of that province.\" This\r\ntapir is as common at Malacca as the rhinoceros and elephant. In size he\r\nclosely approaches the common ass. He is black all over, except the\r\nears, which are fringed with white, and on the back, which is of a pale\r\ngray. His habits are identical with those of the American tapirs, to be\r\ndescribed hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RHINOCEROS.\r\n\r\nAfrican Phacocoerus (_Choeripotamus Africanus_).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the African plains, from Nubia and Senegal to the Cape, we meet with\r\na Pachyderm intermediate between the hippopotamus and the wild boar:\r\nthis is the _Phacocoerus_, which was known to the ancients, and\r\ndesignated by credulous Ælian the _Sus tetrakeros_, or \"Boar with Four\r\nHorns.\" He has no horns, however, but only, beneath each ear, a horny\r\nprotuberance, which greatly disfigures his head, and procures him the\r\npopular appellation of the \"Warty Hog\"--the \"Bush Vark,\" or \"Bush Hog\"\r\nof South Africa (_Choeripotamus Africanus_). He has four projecting\r\ntusks, and long sharp tufted ears. His stature, his feet, his tail, the\r\nmane of stiff bristles which garnishes his neck, identify him with the\r\nwild boar; but his body, almost naked on the flanks and hinder part,\r\nlikens him to an hippopotamus. He is gregarious, of fierce and brutal\r\nhabits, and lives chiefly in the bushes or tall herbage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DAW AND THE QUAGGA.]\r\n\r\nThe Solidungulæ (or Solid-hoofed), which roam among the wide pasturages\r\nof the Tropical regions of the Ancient World, contrast, by the elegance\r\nof their forms and the beauty of their clothing, with the unwieldy\r\nPachyderms, of rugged and swarthy hide, placed by Cuvier under the same\r\nclassification. The Wild Horse does not exist in these latitudes, though\r\nwe may find there the most beautiful species of the genus: the Hémione,\r\nthe Onagra, the Zebra, the Daw, and the Quagga. The _Hemionus_\r\n(\"half-ass\"), which we are endeavouring to acclimatize in Europe, and\r\nnumerous specimens of which may be seen in the Zoological Gardens of\r\nLondon and Paris, is of a clear brown colour all over the body, except\r\nthe belly and legs, which are white. His mane is short, and his tail\r\ngarnished only with a tuft of hairs at the extremity. The species is\r\nAsiatic, and appears to have originated in India, whence it spread\r\nwestward into Asia Minor, and northward into the Steppes which stretch\r\nto the base of the Himalayas. The modern names are _Koulem_, _Kiang_,\r\nand _Dziggethai_ (or \"Mountain Ass\"). He roams in great troops across\r\nthe dreary Asiatic deserts, and is fond of bitter and saline herbage,\r\nand brackish water. Now, as of old, he has \"the range of the mountains\r\nfor his pasture,\" and the \"salt places\" for his dwelling. His swiftness\r\nand wariness render his chase an exciting pastime, and in Persia he is\r\nconsidered the noblest of game.\r\n\r\nThe _Hemippus_ (\"half horse\"), a species closely allied to the Hemionus,\r\nis a native of the fertile districts of Syria and Arabia. Another\r\nspecies, the _Tarpan_, roams the Steppes of Tartary, and is with great\r\ndifficulty tamed to the use of man. He is of a reddish colour, but the\r\nmane and tail are black, and along the back runs a black stripe. The\r\n_Onagra_, _Onager_, or Wild Ass of Tartary, is represented in Abyssinia\r\nby a smaller variety, of very graceful form, whose hide exhibits\r\nalready, upon the legs, some of those well-defined stripes which so\r\nmagnificently adorn the \"outer vestment\" of the Quagga, the Daw, and,\r\nespecially, the Zebra.\r\n\r\nAll these Solidungulæ are identical in habits and character: social\r\namong themselves, they are fierce and mistrustful towards other animals.\r\nWhen in peril, they seek safety at first by rapid flight; but if driven\r\nto bay, they assume a courageous bearing, assail their enemies\r\nintrepidly, and frequently compel them to retreat. It is even asserted\r\nthat the Quagga (_Asinus Quagga_) will mingle with herds of domestic\r\nanimals, and defend them against the attacks of beasts of prey.\r\nAccording to Dr. Gray, this animal derives his name from his voice,\r\nwhich resembles the barking of a dog, or a sound like _Couagg_, or\r\n_Quag_. Pennant calls him the _Quacha_. He resembles the horse in his\r\nhaughty bearing and rapid movements. His head, neck, mane, and shoulders\r\nare blackish-brown, banded with white; the stomach, hind parts, and\r\nlegs are whitish; the dorsal line is black; the ears have two irregular\r\nblack bands and a white tip. In the _Daw_, the blackish-brown tint\r\nextends over all the upper parts of the body, as well as the stripes,\r\nwhich are alternately black and light brown. The Quagga and the Daw\r\nbelong to Southern Africa, and especially to Caffraria. The habitat of\r\nthe Zebra appears to be more extended in range. He is found even as far\r\nnorth as Abyssinia. He was known to the Romans under the name of the\r\n_Hippotigres_, and figured in the sanguinary sports of the Amphitheatre.\r\nAssuredly he is the handsomest species of the genus _Equus_ (Horse). He\r\nis as tall as the Hemionus; his legs are shapely, his mien and bearing\r\nfull of spirit; he has a well-proportioned head, and a coat of\r\nincomparable richness of design, with the skin lustrous, and large black\r\nstripes symmetrically arranged over the whole body, on a ground of pure\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZEBRAS (_Equus Zebra_).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfrica, as I have said above, is the native country of the large\r\nRuminants. Not less remarkable than the Camel in the fantastic\r\noriginality of his form, which matches the exquisite richness of his\r\nskin, the gigantic _Giraffe_ (_Camelopardalis Giraffa_) is distributed\r\nover nearly the whole continent south of the Sahara. Sometimes he even\r\nventures into the Desert; but most frequently his long neck and tall\r\nlegs are seen in the fertile plains of Negroland, the Soudan, the\r\nSenegal, and Nubia. \"His head,\" says a popular zoologist, \"resembles\r\nthat of the camel in the absence of a naked muzzle, and in the shape and\r\norganization of the nostrils, which are oblique and narrow apertures,\r\ndefended by the hair which grows from their margins, and surrounded by\r\ncutaneous muscular fibres, by which the animal can close them at will.\r\nThis is a beautiful provision for the defence of the air passages, and\r\nthe irritable membrane lining the olfactory cavities, against the fine\r\nparticles of sand which the storms of the Desert raise in almost\r\nsuffocating clouds. The large, dark, and lustrous eyes of the giraffe,\r\nwhich beam with a peculiarly mild but fearless expression, are so placed\r\nas to take in a wider range of the horizon than is subject to the vision\r\nof any other quadruped. While browsing on his favourite acacia, the\r\ngiraffe, by means of his laterally-projecting orbits, can direct his\r\nsight so as to anticipate a threatened attack in the rear from the\r\nstealthy lion, or any other foe of the Desert. To an open attack he\r\nsometimes makes a successful defence by striking out his powerful and\r\nwell-armed feet; and the king of beasts is said to be frequently\r\nrepelled and disabled by the wounds which the giraffe has thus inflicted\r\nwith his hoofs.\" The lion, however, seldom attacks him unless he can\r\nsurprise him in a state of repose, when he will leap upon his victim's\r\nback and tear him to pieces.\r\n\r\nLe Vaillant has justly observed that if precedency among animals were\r\ndetermined by their height, the giraffe would hold the first rank. The\r\nmost careless observer must be impressed by the enormous length of his\r\nfore-legs, and his long tapering neck, which enables him to browse upon\r\nthe fresh foliage and green young shoots of the loftiest trees; nor can\r\nhe fail to admire his small and elevated head, his brilliant beaming\r\neyes, and his mildness of aspect. Unusual as are the animal's\r\nproportions, they are not inharmonious, and his appearance is eminently\r\npicturesque. When full grown, he measures seventeen feet from the top of\r\nthe head to the fore-feet. This, however, is a maximum. It should be\r\nadded that his fore-legs are not so much longer than the hind, but the\r\nshoulders are extraordinarily high. The animal's colour is a light fawn,\r\nmarked with numerous darker spots. His horns consist of two porous bony\r\nsubstances, about three inches long, which form, as it were, a part of\r\nthe skull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LION RENDING A GIRAFFE.]\r\n\r\nSeveral species of antelopes and wild oxen traverse in numerous herds\r\nthe wide prairies of Africa and Asia. Among the African species, I may\r\nname the _Bubalus_, which lives principally in the north-west, and whose\r\nkeen stout horns, disposed like the prongs of a pitchfork, render him\r\nexceedingly formidable; the _Gnu_, or Connochetæ (_Catoblepus Gnu_),\r\nwhich inhabits the wild karoos and hilly districts of South Africa, in\r\nmigratory herds, and is distinguished by the weird ugliness of his head,\r\nwith its curved horns, and its beautiful flowing mane, white at the\r\nbase, and black at the tips; the _Oreas Lanna_, improperly called the\r\n\"Cape Eland\" (_Antilope Oreas_), a graceful animal, as large as the\r\nhorse, and five feet high at the shoulder, with straight pointed horns,\r\nwhose great strength is augmented by a spiral wreath; and the _Oryx_\r\n(_Oryx gazella_), Egyptian Antelope, or Pasom, somewhat superior in size\r\nto a deer, with horns three feet long, black hoofs and horns, a white\r\nhead, and neck and upper part of the body of a pale bluish-gray.\r\n\r\nTropical Asia presents but a very small number of Antelopes, properly so\r\ncalled, of which the _Nylghau_, or White-footed Antelope (_Partux\r\npicta_) is the largest. Its face is long and narrow; its black, round,\r\nand pointed horns, though only about seven inches long, are slightly\r\ncurved forwards; the broad ears are fringed with white hairs; along the\r\ntop of the deep narrow neck runs a slight mane of black hair, which is\r\ncontinued to some distance down the back; a long hanging tuft of a\r\nsimilar colour adorns the breast. This animal is said to have abounded\r\nin the forests between Delhi and Lahore in the days of Aurungzebe, and\r\nformed one of the objects of the chase with that \"king of kings\" during\r\nhis expedition to Cashmere. The Hindoo name, \"Nyl-ghau,\" signifies \"blue\r\nox,\" which is true of the male, but the female is a pale brown. He is a\r\ncourageous animal, very difficult to tame; travellers affirm that when\r\nattacked he throws himself on his knees, and in this position moves\r\nforward, until, suddenly leaping to his feet, he rushes impetuously upon\r\nhis enemy, and smites him vigorously with his sharp horns.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to particularize, among the great Ruminants of the\r\nTropical regions of the Old World, the Buffaloes, or Wild Oxen, which\r\nfeed in immense troops in the fertile and well-watered prairies. The two\r\nAfrican species or varieties which are best known are, the Buffalo of\r\nCaffraria, and the Short-horned Buffalo. The former is not confined to\r\nthe Caffre country, as his name would lead one to suppose; but ranges\r\nas far as Abyssinia. His horns, very wide, and close together at the\r\nbase, form, above the eyes, a kind of helmet very useful to the animal\r\nin pushing aside the bushes that impede his progress. His hair is rough\r\nand black over the whole body. The short-horned buffalo has a smooth\r\nbrown skin, muzzle nearly black, ears large, horns arched and of\r\nmoderate dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Antelope Gnu. 2. Oreas Lanna (or Eland). 3. Striped or\r\nBanded Gnu.]\r\n\r\nThese buffaloes, despite of their ferocious aspect and savage habits,\r\nare wholly inoffensive, and in all cases of danger are tempted at first\r\nto take to flight; but should they be pressed too closely, or wounded,\r\ntheir irascible and vindictive disposition speedily displays itself.\r\nWhen the negroes hunt the buffalo, says Paul Gervais, they are very\r\ncareful to attack isolated individuals only, because, in the herds of\r\nthese animals some will always be found disposed to avenge the death of\r\ntheir companions, and pursue the hunters to the uttermost. In their\r\nexcesses of fury they strike the ground with their horns; dash their\r\nbodies against the trees in which their enemies have taken refuge;\r\nsometimes they will spend their rage upon one another, or upon the\r\nbodies of those of their kind which have been brought low.\r\n\r\nAsia is the home of the Common Buffalo (_Bos bubalus_), and from thence\r\nhe has migrated into several islands of the Indian Archipelago, Eastern\r\nEurope, and even into Italy. In France and Great Britain he has long\r\nbeen domesticated. But there also exist in several Indian provinces some\r\nsavage species of the _Arnee Buffalo_ (_Bos Arni_ of Dr. Shaw), easily\r\nrecognized by his horns of prodigious size and length, which frequently\r\nmeasure six feet in length, and eighteen inches in circumference at the\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nTravellers have asserted that nearly all the herbivora, and in\r\nparticular the more feeble and timorous, evince a marked preference for\r\nopen and level places; to such an extent, that the herds of antelopes,\r\ngazelles, and zebras may be seen abandoning their pastures when the\r\nherbage is unusually luxuriant. It is in the thickets, the matted and\r\nalmost impenetrable jungles, and among the tall rank grasses, that the\r\nbeast of prey glides stealthily and unseen upon his intended victim.\r\nWhere the surface of the ground is smooth and bare, the herbivora can\r\ndescry an approaching enemy, and take to flight or make ready for\r\ndefence. It is not, however, the carnaria that they have most cause to\r\ndread, but man; not less cruel he than the stealthy lion or the prowling\r\ntiger, and far more formidable since European commerce has furnished the\r\nsavage with firearms. He quickly learns to make use of these; but prior\r\nto their introduction into wilderness, prairie, and forest, he had\r\ndevised against his prey various more or less successful means of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nIn Central Africa, for instance, the Bakouain Negroes, to capture _en\r\nmasse_ buffaloes, zebras, giraffes, antelopes, and even rhinoceroses,\r\nwhich gather in crowds around the grateful waters, construct a colossal\r\nand all-devouring snare, which they call a _Hopo_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AFRICAN HOPO, OR SNARE FOR HERBIVOROUS ANIMALS.]\r\n\r\n\"This snare,\" says Dr. Livingstone,[125] \"consists of two very stout and\r\nvery high fences, approaching each other so as to assume the shape of a\r\nV; at the apex of the angle, instead of completely joining them, they\r\nare prolonged in a straight line, forming an alley about fifty paces in\r\nlength, abutting on a ditch which may measure from four to five yards\r\nsquare, and be from six to eight feet deep. Trunks of trees are arranged\r\ncross-wise on the borders of this trench, chiefly on the side from which\r\nthe animals will arrive, and upon the opposite one, by which they will\r\nendeavour to escape. These trees form an advanced border above the\r\nditch, rendering flight impossible, and the whole is carefully covered\r\nover with reeds, which hide the snare, and make it resemble a trap\r\nplaced among the herbage. As the two fences are often a mile in length,\r\nwhile the base of the triangle which they define is nearly of the same\r\ndimensions, a company who form around the hopo a circle of three to four\r\nmiles in circumference, by gradually drawing it closer, are certain to\r\ncollect a great quantity of game. The hunters direct by their cries the\r\nanimals which they surround, and cause them to reach the summit of the\r\nhopo. Men concealed at this point then fling their javelins into the\r\nmidst of the affrighted herd, which, dashing headlong through the\r\nsolitary opening it can find, involves itself in the narrow alley\r\nleading to the ditch. The animals fall in pell-mell, until the snare is\r\nfilled with a living mass, which enables the others to escape by passing\r\nover the bodies of the victims. The spectacle is horrifying; the\r\nhunters, intoxicated by the pursuit, and no longer controlling\r\nthemselves, strike these graceful animals with a delirious joy, while\r\nthe poor creatures, crushed to the bottom of the abyss beneath the\r\nweight of the dead and dying, raise from time to time the pile of\r\ncarcasses, by struggling, in the midst of their agony, against the\r\nburden which suffocates them.\"\r\n\r\nOf the _corral_ in which the Cingalese entraps the elephant, and of the\r\ningenious snares laid by the Malay or the Indian for the murderous\r\ntiger, I shall speak hereafter. Between man and the carnivora it was\r\nnatural that a deadly war should be incessantly waged; but humanity\r\nwould seem to dictate towards the inoffensive herbivora a less\r\nsanguinary hostility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE PRAIRIES OF THE OLD WORLD, CONTINUED:--THE CARNIVORA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to man, the most dangerous enemies of the peaceful herbivora are\r\nthe great Carnivora of the _Felidæ_ genus, in whose first rank\r\nzoologists and poets were formerly wont to place the lion.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"king of animals,\" however, has of late years lost much of\r\nhis prestige. Observant travellers have watched him with a jealous and\r\nsuspicious eye; intrepid hunters have dared to measure themselves\r\nagainst him, and to beard him in his retreats. Our popular heroes suffer\r\ngreatly by this close examination. Achilles to his Myrmidons, I suspect,\r\nwas less godlike than he appeared to the warriors of Troy, who saw him\r\nonly in the rush and tumult of the battle. Certain it is that the\r\nresearches of modern science have stripped the lion of most of the\r\nsplendid attributes with which romance had invested him. Here is a\r\nglowing picture:--\r\n\r\n                                     \"The lion,\r\n   Who long has reign'd the terror of the woods,\r\n   And dared the boldest huntsman to the combat,\r\n   When caught at length within some hidden snare,\r\n   With foaming jaws he bites the toils that hold him,\r\n   And roars, and rolls his fiery eyes in vain,\r\n   While the surrounding swains wound him at pleasure.\"--(_Nathaniel Rowe._)\r\n\r\nBut the fact is, that with all his prodigious strength, his terrible\r\nteeth and claws, his imposing physiognomy and attitudes, he is an animal\r\nmore prudent than courageous, and very unlike the highly-coloured\r\nportrait which Buffon painted. There have not been wanting\r\nwell-accredited authorities to accuse him of cowardice; as our own\r\ncountryman Livingstone, and the Frenchman Delegorgue. According to the\r\nlatter, he is but a nocturnal robber, whom a ray of light disconcerts,\r\nor the barking of dogs, and the shouts of men, women, and children, or\r\na blow from a well-applied whip, will frequently put to flight. Even if\r\nprovoked, or wounded by man, he will often refuse to fight to the last\r\nextremity; or if he accept the challenge, and succeed in harassing his\r\nantagonist, he contents himself by breaking a limb or two, by marking\r\nhis chest with his teeth and nails, after which he leaves him and goes\r\nhis way. \"I have known,\" says Delegorgue, \"an intrepid hunter who, twice\r\nin seven years, had been treated in this fashion by a wounded lion; the\r\nfirst encounter cost him two broken limbs; the second, six fractures,\r\nwithout counting the deep scars left by his claws on several parts of\r\nthe body. Another, named Vermaës, in his daring, was held for more than\r\na minute by a lion, and got quit with four deep marks of his canine\r\nteeth; glorious scars, which he showed to me with an air of lively\r\nsatisfaction.\" Livingstone records a similar adventure which befell\r\nhimself with a lion at which he had aimed a couple of shots. The wounded\r\nanimal turned upon his aggressor, harried him, severely injured an arm,\r\nand then directed his wrath against one of the doctor's companions, whom\r\nhe seized by the shoulder. He intended, in all probability, to\r\nadminister a similar correction to this individual, when suddenly the\r\ntwo bullets he had received produced their effect, and he fell dead.\r\n\r\nThese facts prove, at least, that if the lion is not brave he is not\r\nmalicious, and that the reputation for generosity which he has borne\r\nfrom remote times was not undeserved. It is only in his old age that the\r\nlion willingly enters upon a regimen of human flesh, from sheer want of\r\npower to obtain any other easily. When a lion is too old, says\r\nLivingstone, to provide himself with game by hunting, he frequently\r\nenters into the very villages and kills the goats; if, then, a woman or\r\na child go out at night, he makes them equally his prey; and as\r\nthenceforth he has no other means of subsistence, he continues to feed\r\nhimself in this manner. Hence has arisen the saying, that if a lion once\r\ntastes human flesh he prefers it to all other kinds. The beasts which\r\nattack man are invariably aged lions. When one of them conquers the fear\r\ninspired by man so far as to approach a village and seize the goats,\r\nthe inhabitants invariably say, \"His teeth are worn out, and he will\r\nsoon kill somebody;\" and feeling the necessity of defending themselves,\r\nthey hunt him immediately.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed, on the authority of Buffon, that the lion\r\nlives in retirement with his mate, that he hunts in solitary dignity,\r\nand will suffer no other carnaria, not even one of his own race, to hunt\r\nin his own domain. This is an error. Lions, on the contrary, often\r\nassemble in a \"hunting-party,\" four or five in number, when they fly at\r\n\"high game,\" such as a buffalo or a giraffe. M. Vardon saw three lions\r\nthrow themselves at once on a buffalo which he had just wounded with a\r\nmusket-shot. \"During the day-time, in winter,\" says Delegorgue, \"you may\r\nfrequently see troops of lions, which assemble together for the purpose\r\nof marking off and driving the game towards the ravines, or wooded glens\r\ndifficult of access, where some of their companions are posted; these\r\nare strict _battues_, conducted without any noise, the odours of the\r\nlions being sufficient to enforce the retreat of the herbivora which\r\nthey pursue.\" The lion himself may, in his turn, be chased and tracked\r\nwith dogs, like a wild boar, a wolf, or a stag; but most frequently the\r\nhunters pursue and shoot him on foot, and this is but a pleasure-jaunt\r\nfor a man of sang-froid, if a good shot, and well acquainted with the\r\nanimal's habits.\r\n\r\nWe know that the roar of the lion--that is, of the hungry lion--is\r\nconsidered the most terrible of cries, which inspires all the animals,\r\nand even man, with unconquerable dread. It appears, however, that\r\nman--to say nothing of his dogs--speedily grows accustomed to it, and\r\nthat the lion, in his turn, cannot be frightened by the barking of the\r\nlatter. A very curious fact, remarked by Livingstone, is the singular\r\nresemblance of the lion's roar to the cry of the ostrich. \"I have\r\ncarefully inquired,\" says the great African traveller, \"the opinion of\r\nEuropeans who have heard both. I have asked them if they could discover\r\nthe least difference between the roar of the one and the cry of the\r\nother. They have all informed me that they could not perceive any, at\r\nwhatever distance the animal might be placed. The voice of the lion,\r\ngenerally, is deeper than the ostrich's; but up to the present time I\r\nhave only been able to distinguish it with certainty because it is heard\r\nduring the day, and the ostrich's during the night.\"\r\n\r\nLions were formerly common enough in all Southern Asia, Persia, Asia\r\nMinor, and even Greece. They long ago disappeared from these countries,\r\nand are rarely met with now-a-days in Hindostan. The Indian lion is\r\nsmaller than his African congener; his mane is shorter and less\r\nabundant, and several naturalists signalize him as a distinct species,\r\nintermediary between the true African lion and the American puma. There\r\nare three varieties of Asiatic lions: the Bengal, the Persian or\r\nArabian, and the maneless lion of Goojerat--the latter confined to a\r\nvery narrow district. The African \"king of beasts\" is spread over the\r\nentire continent from the Mediterranean to the Cape of Good Hope; but\r\nthe species includes three kinds: the Barbary lion, with a deep\r\nyellowish-brown fur and a full flowing mane; the Senegal, whose fur is\r\nof a brighter yellow, and whose mane thinner; and the Cape, of which\r\nthere are two varieties, one brown, the other yellowish; the former\r\nbeing the fiercer and more powerful animal.\r\n\r\nA lion of the largest size measures about eight feet from the nose to\r\nthe tail, and the tail itself about four feet. The male has usually a\r\nthick shaggy mane; the head is large, with rounded ears, and the face\r\ncovered with short close hair; great strength and muscular force\r\ndistinguish his conformation; and the tail terminates in a tuft of hair,\r\nwhich is not fully developed until he is six or seven years old.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the lion has for his fellows the Leopard and the Panther. Many\r\nwriters at one time confounded these two Felidæ, and even classified\r\nthem with the Indian tiger. For the vulgar, every great cat with a\r\nspotted skin _is_ a tiger. But scientific naturalists neither apply this\r\nname to the American jaguar nor to other spotted Felidæ of the Old or\r\nNew World; and it is with difficulty they now agree to recognize in the\r\nLeopard and the Panther two ill-defined varieties of the same species.\r\nAssuredly they exhibit very marked differences. The Leopard is nearly as\r\nlarge as the lion; his limbs are robust, his head is strong. From nose\r\nto tail he measures four feet, his tail is two feet and a half long, and\r\nhis body so flexible that he accomplishes the most surprising leaps,\r\nand swims, and climbs trees, or crawls along the ground, serpent-like,\r\nwith admirable ease. Compared with the jaguar and panther of\r\nnaturalists, he is uniformly of a paler and more yellowish colour, and\r\nrather smaller, while the spots on his skin are rose-formed, or consist\r\nof several dots partially united into a circular figure in some\r\ninstances, and in others into a quadrangular, triangular, or other less\r\ndeterminate forms. The lower part of the neck and inner parts of the\r\nlimbs are white; the spots are continued upon the tail, which is long,\r\nand black at the extremity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AFRICAN LEOPARD.]\r\n\r\nThe Panther is larger than the leopard, measuring about six feet and a\r\nhalf from nose to tail, which is itself about three feet long. On his\r\nsleek hide the spots are disposed in circles of four or five, with,\r\nusually, a central spot in each circle, in which, as well as in his\r\ndeeper colour, he differs from the leopard. Both are handsome, stealthy,\r\nand ferocious animals; supple, agile, and muscular. The leopard (_Felis\r\nleopardus_) is a native of Africa, principally ranging along its\r\nwestern coast and on the confines of the Sahara. The panther (_Felis\r\npardus_) is also an African denizen, though likewise found in Arabia,\r\nPersia, and Hindostan. During the day he lurks in the thickets and among\r\nthe tall grasses, but when the shades of night descend he issues from\r\nhis lair, and haunts the brooks and pools whither the herbivora resort\r\nto quench their thirst. There, upon some rock, he lies in ambuscade,\r\ncommanding the track pursued by innocent victims, and darting with\r\nunerring precision upon the first which presents itself.\r\n\r\nNeither leopard nor panther often ventures to assail man. When attacked\r\nby him, they seek at first to make their escape, and only turn at bay\r\nwhen escape is impossible. In Java, and some other of the great Indian\r\nislands, there exists a black panther, which has gained, it is difficult\r\nto say _how_, the reputation of extraordinary ferocity and daring.\r\nSometimes, in the world of man, great reputations are built upon equally\r\nslight foundations. He owes his fame to the imagination of the natives,\r\nand differs from his congeners in no single respect but the blackish\r\ncolour of his skin. A skilful naturalist, who was for some years a\r\nresident in Java, relates that, while botanizing in the fields and\r\njungles early in the day, he frequently roused the black panthers in\r\ntheir lairs. At first he was somewhat startled by the apparition of an\r\nanimal of such terrible renown, but seeing him turn tail very quickly on\r\nhis approach, he soon grew re-assured, and troubled himself no more at\r\nthese rencontres than if he had met a dog or a cat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to the most formidable of all the Carnaria: the Tiger,\r\nproperly so called, or Royal Tiger, whose portrait Buffon has been\r\npleased to paint with his boldest brush and most glowing colours,\r\nwithout any other motive apparently than a love of antithesis, or the\r\nartist's desire to give force and effect to a striking picture. He had\r\nendowed the king of animals with all the regal qualities his imagination\r\ncould suggest, and by way of contrast he ascribed to the tiger the\r\nlowest and cruellest instincts. He painted him as the Moloch of the\r\nbrute creation; the Domitian, Caligula, or Nero of the jungles. He was\r\nblood-thirsty, treacherous, cowardly, and hideous. His limbs were too\r\nshort, his head was too large, he was ill-proportioned; in a word, on\r\nthe unfortunate beast he poured out all the vials of his satiric wrath.\r\n\r\nWith this _pièce de fantaisie_ it would be curious to contrast the\r\ngraver and more authentic description of the impartial Daubenton. He\r\nasserted that the tiger was very little known to Europeans, and that in\r\nFrance there existed but a single specimen, and that a very badly\r\nprepared one, in the \"Cabinet du Roi.\" But we are now better informed,\r\nand the tiger, perhaps, up to a certain point, is rehabilitated. Let us\r\ntake him first in his physical aspect. All travellers agree in\r\ndescribing him as the handsomest of animals. He has not the grave\r\ncountenance, the majestic attitudes of the lion; but he has all the\r\ngrace, all the suppleness, all the lively and undulatory movements of\r\nthe domestic cat. He does not stand so high upon his legs as the lion,\r\nand he lacks that full flowing mane which invests the physiognomy of the\r\nlatter with a human and truly noble air; but all the parts of his head\r\nand body, despite of Buffon, are admirably proportioned. Not quite so\r\ntall as the lion, and less robust in appearance, he is endowed with a\r\nsurprising vigour. He can carry off, while in full career, and making\r\nthe most rapid leaps, the heaviest prey--a kid, for instance, an\r\nantelope of full size, even a bull, it is said, and, necessarily, a man.\r\nFinally, his skin, symmetrically striped, like a zebra's, with wavy\r\nbands of brown and black, on a reddish ground, with the contour of the\r\nface, the chin and belly of the purest white, defies all comparison. The\r\nstripes of his head, legs, and tail are disposed with irreproachable\r\nsymmetry in curves of the most graceful character. So much for his\r\nphysical character; let us pass to his moral.\r\n\r\nHis appetites, and consequently his manners and instincts, differ but\r\nlittle from those of the other Felidæ, and, in particular, of the lion.\r\nWhile he has a keen love of living flesh and warm blood, he does not\r\nscorn to return, under the pressure of hunger, to a dead prey already\r\npartially devoured. Like all the carnaria, a sagacious instinct prompts\r\nhim to kill in provision for coming as well as for present hunger. This\r\nis the reason that Buffon has stigmatized him as \"unnecessarily cruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"The bound with which he throws himself upon his prey,\" says an English\r\nnaturalist, \"is as wonderful in its extent as it is terrible in its\r\neffects.\" Pennant justly observes that the distance which it clears in\r\nthis deadly leap is scarcely credible. Man is a mere puppet in his\r\ngripe; and the Indian buffalo is not only borne down by the ferocious\r\nbeast, but carried off by his enormous strength. If he fails in his\r\nspring, it has been said that he will take to flight. This may be true\r\nin certain instances; but, in general, far from slinking away, he\r\npursues the affrighted prey with a speedy activity which is seldom\r\nexerted in vain. Hence we are led to the observation of Pliny\r\ncelebrating his swiftness, for which the Roman zoologist has been\r\ncensured, and apparently most unjustly; nor is he the only author among\r\nthe ancients who notices his speed. Appian speaks of the swift tiger as\r\nthe offspring of the zephyr. Pliny, says Pennant, has been frequently\r\ntaken to task by the moderns for calling the tiger \"animal tremendæ\r\nvelocitatis;\" they allow it great agility in its bounds, but deny it\r\nswiftness in pursuit. Two travellers of authority, both eye-witnesses,\r\nconfirm what Pliny says: the one, indeed, only mentions in general his\r\nvast fleetness; the other saw a trial between one and a swift horse,\r\nwhose rider escaped merely by getting in time amidst a circle of armed\r\nmen. The chase of this animal was a favourite diversion with the great\r\nCam-Hi, the Chinese monarch, in whose company our countryman, Mr. Bell,\r\nthat faithful traveller, and the Perè Gerbillon, saw these proofs of the\r\ntiger's speed.\r\n\r\nThe Latin \"tigris\" is from a Persian word signifying \"swift as an\r\narrow,\" which we find incorporated in the name of the river Tigris.\r\n\r\nThe tiger's habits are essentially nocturnal, and almost aquatic. His\r\nfavourite haunts are the banks of rivers and lakes, not only because he\r\nmay there pounce upon the herbivora which come to drink, but because he\r\ncan there satisfy himself with a banquet of fish. To this he is as\r\npartial as any European epicure, and in angling his skill and dexterity\r\nare not unworthy of an Izaak Walton. He is the \"complete angler\" of the\r\ncarnivorous world! He swims admirably, and in pursuit of his prey never\r\nhesitates at the most tremendous \"header,\" so that the Arnee Buffaloes,\r\nwhich traverse immense distances by yielding themselves to the swift\r\nriver-currents, have more cause to dread his attacks than those of the\r\ncrocodiles.\r\n\r\nBuffon has calumniated the tiger by accusing him of cowardice, while, as\r\nwe have seen, he has not less grossly flattered the lion by representing\r\nhim as the perfect type of intrepidity. During the day the tiger, after\r\nhaving supped freely, sleeps in his den; he avoids man, and when aroused\r\nby the hunters, his first movement is one of flight. But by night or\r\nday, if he be an hungered, no obstacle arrests, no peril daunts him; and\r\nhe pounces upon man as he would upon any other prey. He penetrates into\r\nisolated habitations; breaks into the villages, and sometimes even into\r\nthe towns; seizes the domestic animals in their very stables; men even\r\nwithin the shelter of their own houses; and sometimes devours his spoil\r\nupon the spot; sometimes, if he fears pursuit, drags it off to his\r\nsecret lair.\r\n\r\nAt Goa, in a butcher's stall, was slain a tiger which had fallen asleep\r\nthere after gorging himself with food; and in the vicinity of that once\r\nfamous, but now degraded city, a cross marks the spot where a Portuguese\r\nofficer, marching at the head of his men, was seized before their eyes\r\nby a tiger, and carried off before they could make the slightest effort\r\nto save him.\r\n\r\nTigers are found in India, in the Indo-Chinese Peninsula, at Borneo, at\r\nJava, and at Sumatra. Civilization has hunted them out of the Celestial\r\nEmpire, but they are met with in Tartary, even in extremely cold\r\nlatitudes. The tigers of the North a beneficent Nature has furnished\r\nwith much longer hair than their congeners of the Tropical zone, and\r\nthey seem to form a distinct variety of the species. Wherever the tiger\r\nexists, war _à l'outrance_ is declared between man and him! It is a\r\nvendetta which has been handed down from the remotest antiquity, and is\r\nas bitter now as in any past generation. Every year hundreds of persons\r\nfall victims to his appetite and his prowess; every year hundreds of\r\nhis race are shot down by the relentless sportsman, or ensnared and\r\nkilled by the peasants, whose cattle and whose lives he threatens.\r\n\r\nBy the Malays and the half-savage Indians who dwell among the\r\nIndo-Chinese jungles, he is hunted in the same way that the African\r\nnegroes hunt the lion and the leopard. When the presence of one of these\r\nscourges becomes known in a district, they place some dainty bait on the\r\nbank of the river where he drinks and plants himself every night, and\r\nthey form an ambush among the thickets, taking care to mark the\r\ndirection of the wind. It is not long before the tiger directs his steps\r\ntowards the enticing booty, and the hunters' arrows or musket-balls\r\nstretch him dead, in most cases, before he can seize it.\r\n\r\nA vast amount of pompous preparation attaches to the tiger-hunt of\r\nIndia. It is a sumptuous expedition, commanded by some distinguished\r\nchief--an European officer, a native prince, or a stranger of rank--in\r\nwhich each person has his allotted station and particular duties.\r\nUsually the hunters are mounted on elephants, so that the tiger cannot\r\nreach them on the back of the colossus, without being arrested by the\r\ntrunk of the latter or his formidable tusks. Each sportsman provides\r\nhimself with three or four rifles, besides revolvers and cutlasses.\r\nFormerly the Hindu rajahs made use in this chase of arrows and lances,\r\nbut now they greatly prefer the European weapons. The expedition is\r\nnever an _impromptu_ affair. It is always organized against an enemy\r\nwhose presence has been discovered in the district, and whose den is\r\npretty well known. The march commences at sunrise, that the beast may be\r\nsurprised while enjoying his siesta, after the fatigues and the plunder\r\nof the night. Suddenly awaking, says Mr. Stocqueler,[126] he bounds out\r\nof the jungle, and is saluted by a discharge which often proves\r\nsufficient; but sometimes the animal is safe and sound, or only wounded;\r\nthen he furiously springs upon the first elephant within his reach. If\r\nthe hunter has not time to plant a ball in his chest or head, the\r\nposition of the _mahout_, or driver, is very critical; for, placed on\r\nthe elephant's neck, he has no other defence than the sharp iron-pointed\r\nstick which he uses to guide his colossal steed. Fortunately the hunters\r\nare arrayed in a compact mass, and a few well-directed shots terminate\r\nthe struggle.\r\n\r\nThe most favourable districts for tiger-hunting, continues Mr.\r\nStocqueler, are those of Goruckpore, on the frontiers of Nepaul. Sir\r\nRoger Martin relates that in this quarter once reigned a tiger of such\r\nferocity, and so greedy of human blood, that he was the terror of all\r\nthe \"country-side.\" Once he broke open, in full day-light, the\r\ncabin-door of a Taroo; but the native dealt him such a lusty blow on the\r\nhead with his hatchet that he took to flight, and ever afterwards\r\npreserved the mark of the wound, which caused him to be easily\r\nrecognized, and dreaded all the more. Sir Roger resolved to free the\r\ncountry from this plague; he took the field like a gallant soldier, but\r\nslew eight-and-forty tigers before he fell in with the Balafré of ill\r\nrenown, who defended himself gallantly, and proved no easy victim.\r\nAbbye-Singh, rajah of Omorah, one of the oldest hunters of the country,\r\nslew, it is said, to his own hand more than five hundred tigers; a fact\r\nwhich illustrates their numerousness in the Terac, Nepaul, and\r\nGoruckpore. Despite the activity and address of the hunters, they would\r\nnever succeed in purging the country; but civilization and clearances of\r\nthe ground are driving the wild beasts inch by inch towards the north,\r\nwhere the hardy amateurs of \"sport\" must now go in quest of them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIGER-HUNTING IN THE INDO-CHINESE PENINSULA.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Felidæ of the Old World peculiar to Tropical Asia, I must cite\r\nthe _Reinaoudahan_, distinguished by his woolly and tufted tail, from\r\nwhence he has received the name of the \"Fox-tailed Tiger,\" and the\r\n_Guépard_, or \"Maned Leopard,\" \"Hunting Leopard,\" and \"Cheetah.\" I am\r\ninclined to believe that these two varieties really signify one animal;\r\nthe _Gueparda jubata_ of naturalists. \"Intermediate in size and shape\r\nbetween the leopard and the hound,\" says Burnett, \"he is slenderer in\r\nhis body, more elevated on his legs, and less flattened on the fore part\r\nof his head than the former, while he is deficient in the peculiarly\r\ngraceful form, both of head and body, which characterizes the latter.\r\nHis tail is entirely that of a rat; and his limbs, although more\r\nelongated than in any other species of that group, seem to be better\r\nfitted for strong muscular exertion than for active and long-continued\r\nspeed.\" His anatomical structure and general habits are those of the\r\nFelidæ, but the fur is crisper. The general ground-colour is a bright\r\nyellowish-brown above, lighter on the sides, and nearly white beneath.\r\nOn the back, sides, and limbs he is marked with numerous black spots,\r\nwhich on the tail are so closely set together that they appear like\r\nrings. The cheetah is easily tamed, and trained to the chase; for which\r\npurpose, like our staghounds, he is bred and employed in Persia and\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other families of digitigrade Carnivora, Dogs, Hyænas, Viverras\r\n(_Viverra_, Civet), Mustelidæ (_Mustela_, Weasel), are largely\r\nrepresented in the prairies and jungles of the tropical regions of the\r\nOld World. Wild dogs, with straight ears, a pendant tail, scanty\r\nbristling hair, thin flanks, wander in numerous troops over the plains\r\nof Southern Africa, living, like the wolf or the hyæna, by hunting the\r\nsmall quadrupeds and devouring the remains of carcasses abandoned by the\r\ngreater Carnivora. The jackals, and even the hyænas, range far beyond\r\nthe limits of the Desert. At the Cape exists a larger and more ferocious\r\nspecies of hyæna than that of the Sahara, from which it differs\r\nexternally, its skin being marked with spots instead of stripes.\r\nMoreover, the disproportion in the height of the fore and hind legs is\r\nmore marked in this animal than in his North African congener.\r\n\r\nAt the Cape, also, and in a great part of South Africa, we find another\r\nspecies, the _Hyæna villosa_, or \"Sea-Shore Wolf;\" distinguished from\r\nthe preceding by having stripes on the legs, while the rest of the body\r\nis of a dark grayish-brown. Allied to the Hyænas is the _Proteles_, or\r\n\"Aard-Wolf \" (_Proteles Lalandii_), an animal nearly as large as a\r\njackal, inhabiting the southern parts of the African Continent. He has\r\nthe teeth and pointed head of the civits; the striped fur and stiff\r\nbristly hair of the hyænas. The general colour is a yellowish-gray,\r\nradiated with transverse stripes of dusky black; the tail is short and\r\nbushy. The fore-feet are provided with five toes; the hinder ones with\r\nfour; all the claws being strong and large. He burrows like a fox, and\r\nprowls abroad at night in search of food, which consists chiefly of\r\ncarrion and small vermin. But it is said that he particularly affects\r\nthe enormous fatty tail of the African sheep, devouring with avidity the\r\nsemi-fluid mass, which requires no mastication.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPOTTED HYÆNAS (_Hyæna crocuta_).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious and most graceful of the South African carnaria\r\nis the _Fennec_, or _Zorda_ (_Megatolis_), a genus of Canidæ, resembling\r\nthe European fox in form and stature, but his hair of a light brown\r\ncolour; his muzzle is of extreme fineness, and his eye lively and\r\nintelligent; his enormous ears gift him with an extraordinary delicacy\r\nof hearing. Every animal has its particular taste, and that of the\r\nFennec is for ostrich eggs, which, as he cannot open them with his teeth\r\non account of their size, he breaks by dashing them against hard angular\r\nstones. He is not only met with at the Cape, but in Dongola, Nubia, and\r\nthe Sahara south of Tunis and Constantina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZIBETH, AND INDIAN GENET.]\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this chapter without alluding to a few of the\r\nCarnivora with elongated snout and non-retractile claws, which inhabit\r\nthe plains of Southern Asia and the great adjacent islands. The first\r\nplace I give to the _Cuon Bansu_, or Pariah Dog of India, which seems\r\nallied to both the Wild Dog, the Wolf, and the Jackal. His eyes are\r\nprominent, his skin is of a reddish-yellow, brightest about the head,\r\nspotted with black upon the tail. He is a gregarious animal, hunting in\r\nlarge troops, and waging war against hares, gazelles, antelopes. He will\r\neven venture to attack the buffaloes. Some varieties of this species\r\nrange high up on the mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRIPED PARODOXURE OF JAVA DEVOURING A CRESTED GOURA.]\r\n\r\nFrom the order of Carnivora I might also select, in the wild plains in\r\nthe Old World, more than one curious species for our investigation, if\r\nmy space permitted me to pass in review the two families of the\r\nViverridæ and the Mustelidæ. To the former belong the famous\r\n_Ichneumon_, that assiduous reptile-destroyer which the ancient\r\nEgyptians included in their religious _cultus_; the _Genets_ (_Viverra\r\ngenetta_) with their sleek, soft fur, natives of the western parts of\r\nAsia, India, and Java; the _Civets_ (_Viverra civetta_), which furnish\r\nthe commerce of Europe and the East with a once popular scent, to which\r\nimportant medical virtues were attributed; the _Zibeth_ (_Viverra\r\nzibetha_), a maneless civet, peculiar to Asia as the latter is to\r\nAfrica, and met with in Sumatra, Borneo, Amboyna, the Celebes, and\r\nHindostan; and, finally, the _Paradoxures_ (animals with a fantastic or\r\nparadoxical tail), so named by Cuvier because the individual studied by\r\nthat great naturalist kept his tail constantly coiled up and inclined on\r\nthe same side. All these Carnivora are of small stature; their short\r\npaws are furnished with demi-retractile claws; their body is excessively\r\nelongated, and of a worm-like shape; their tail is long and flexible,\r\nthe muzzle tapering, the fur soft, and of a tawny or reddish colour,\r\nwith spots or bands of black or brown.\r\n\r\nThe Mustelidæ are allied to the Viverridæ in their general conformation.\r\nTheir skin is equally soft, and capable of furnishing a beautiful fur;\r\nbut its colour is generally uniform. The head is more rounded, the\r\nmuzzle more obtuse, the tail shorter, than in members of the preceding\r\nfamily. Finally, a great number are plantigrades. These animals are more\r\ncommonly distributed over the cold regions of the Northern hemisphere\r\nthan in countries bordering on the Tropics. The genus _Ratel_ (_Ratellus\r\nmellivorus_), however, is represented both in India and South Africa.\r\nThe Cape species is celebrated for the havoc it makes among the nests of\r\nthe wild bees, of whose honey it is singularly fond, and to whose\r\ndiscovery it is assisted by the voice and movements of a bird called the\r\nHoney-Guide. It has a rough tongue, short legs, with very long claws, a\r\nblunt, black nose, no external ears, a remarkably tough and loose skin,\r\nwith thick hair. Its colours are ashen gray on the upper parts, and\r\nblack on the inferior, and its length from the nose to the tip of the\r\ntail is forty inches, the tail measuring twelve. The Indian species,\r\ndiffering but little from the African, inhabits Bengal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE PRAIRIES OF THE OLD WORLD:--BIRDS AND REPTILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe savannahs and marshes of the ancient continent are frequented by\r\nbirds of great stature: Cursores, Raptores, and Palmipeds. The colossus\r\nof the feathered world, the _Ostrich_, which has been aptly surnamed\r\nthe Camel-Bird (_Struthio camelus_), inhabits the arid plains of the\r\nAfrican interior, and frequently penetrates into the Sahara. The male is\r\nof a glossy black, with white on the wings and tail; the female wears an\r\nuniformly dusky livery. It is the loose flexible plumes of the male\r\nwhich are so prized for a lady's toilette, and which figure in the crest\r\nof the prince of Wales. The female's feathers are of inferior value, and\r\nimproperly designated in commerce, \"vulture-feathers.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ostrich lives with his fellows in flocks of some number. He feeds\r\nvoraciously on grass, grain, young twigs, and will swallow pieces of\r\nwood, leather, metal, or any hard substance. In his apparent want of\r\ntaste he is probably guided by instinct, for these objects are probably\r\nuseful in promoting the work of digestion. Some travellers have\r\nrepresented him as a stupid animal; but this is an error, for he\r\ndisplays both vigilance and shrewdness in avoiding the attacks of his\r\nenemies. The chase of this bird is exceedingly laborious, for though he\r\ndoes not fly he skims the ground, and his wings impel him forward with a\r\nvelocity which distances the swiftest horse. But neither his speed nor\r\nhis strength avails against the stratagems of man. The Arab horsemen\r\nsurround the flock in a circle, which they gradually contract as they\r\nadvance, until the poor birds are confined in a very narrow area, and\r\ndashing madly against one another, fall exhausted with fatigue. They are\r\nthen slain by a few blows from a stick.\r\n\r\nThe female lays from ten to twelve eggs in a hole in the sand; she\r\nbroods over them during the night, occasionally leaving them in the\r\nhottest part of the day. In procuring the eggs, which weigh about three\r\npounds each, and are reputed a great delicacy, the natives are very\r\ncareful not to touch any with their hands, as the parent birds would be\r\nsure to discover it on their return, and not only discontinue laying any\r\nmore in the same place, but trample to pieces all those which have not\r\nbeen removed. A long stick is accordingly made use of to push them from\r\nthe nest.\r\n\r\nAnother gigantic bird, whose wings are but partially developed, and\r\nwhose legs are long and robust, the _galeated_ or _helmeted Cassowary_\r\n(_Casuarius_), is a native of Java and the adjacent islands of the\r\nIndian Archipelago. His head is surmounted by a sort of osseous crest or\r\nhorny helmet. In size he is much inferior to the ostrich, not exceeding\r\nfive feet when erect; but he is robustly built, and of exceeding\r\nstrength. His plumage is very poorly supplied with feathers, so as to\r\nresemble at a little distance, it is said, a coat of coarse or hanging\r\nhair. He is a swift runner, like the ostrich; is equally voracious, and\r\nnot more dainty in his food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSTRICHES (_Struthio camelus_).]\r\n\r\nAt that season of the year when the coming winter in our Northern\r\nhemisphere already \"casts its shadows before,\" legions of migratory\r\nbirds swarm towards the tropical regions of Africa and Asia. Storks and\r\ncranes, and aquatic birds, descend upon those vast and genial southern\r\nprairies, where they obtain in abundance the precious food denied them\r\nin less favoured climes.\r\n\r\nA beautiful crane, of ashen plumage, with a shapely ebon-black neck,\r\nand her head adorned with two white tufts of plumes, the \"Lady of\r\nNumidia,\" selects for her dwelling-place the eastern and western shores\r\nof the African Continent.\r\n\r\nThe Stork (_Ciconia_) is a cosmopolitan bird which alternately favours\r\nwith his presence the North of Europe and the Torrid Zone, everywhere\r\ndischarging with fidelity his useful sanitary mission by destroying\r\nmyriads of noxious vermin. To kill them was considered by the ancients a\r\nfoul crime, which could only be fitly punished by death, and the\r\nEgyptians included the Stork with the Ibis in their allegorical and\r\nmysterious worship. In his migrations he avoids the two extremes of heat\r\nand cold, never going farther north than Russia, nor, in winter, further\r\nsouth than the land of the Nile. The White Stork (_Ciconia alba_) is\r\nupwards of three feet six inches long. One species, popularly known as\r\nthe _Marabout_, never quits Africa and the Indies. The name is also\r\napplied to the light silken feathers which embellish the wings of the\r\nspecies--one of the ugliest, let me add, created by Nature, with his\r\nbald head and neck, his huge beak, and absurdly meditative postures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe chief of the birds of the shore and river-bank, the Flamingo\r\n(_Phoenicopterus_), may merit admiration on account of his dazzling\r\nscarlet plumage and handsome bearing. Owing to the great length of his\r\nlegs and neck he stands nearly five feet high, and measures six feet\r\nfrom the point of the beak to the tip of the claws. The small round head\r\nis furnished with a bill nearly seven inches long, which is higher than\r\nit is wide, light and hollow, having a membrane at the base, and\r\nsuddenly curving downwards from the middle. The legs and thighs are\r\nsingularly delicate and slender. The Flamingoes are timid and suspicious\r\nbirds; they keep together when feeding, drawn up in artificial array\r\nlike the lines of a battalion of British infantry, with some of their\r\nnumber planted as sentinels to give notice of the approach of danger.\r\nTheir voice has a peculiarly deep trumpet-like sound. At the note of\r\nalarm they all take to flight, swooping through the air in the form of a\r\ntriangle.\r\n\r\nThey are skilful fishers. They wade deep into the water, where their\r\nlong necks enable them to seize their prey with ease. Their food\r\nconsists of spawn, insects, and molluscous animals. Owing to their\r\npeculiar structure they are both waders and swimmers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSE FLAMINGOES (_Phoenicopterus antiquorum_).]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the African Grallatores wage a murderous war against reptiles\r\nin the marshes and the meads; a war which claims the gratitude of man,\r\nwho could never defend himself against their prolific increase and\r\npertinacious attacks. I have already referred to the Stork; it is\r\nneedful I should also mention the Ibis, once an object of worship on the\r\nbanks of the Nile; the Jacana, his long claws armed with sharpened nails\r\nthat transfix his prey; the formidable-billed Baléniceps, which devours\r\nthe young crocodiles; and the famous Serpent-Bird of the Cape, belonging\r\nto the Grallatores by his legs, to the Raptores by the talons and\r\ncrooked beak with which he is provided, as well as by the structure of\r\nhis internal organs. These birds are the allies and protectors of man,\r\nas Michelet has shown with characteristic eloquence in his rhapsodical\r\nprose poem, \"_L'Oiseau_;\" yet even these, in their combined efforts,\r\nare insufficient against the prolific races of aquatic and terrestrial\r\nreptiles, some formidable by their size and strength, some by their\r\nsubtlety and venom. The narratives of the adventurous men who have not\r\nfeared to incur\r\n\r\n    \"The moving accidents of flood and field,\"\r\n\r\nin traversing the wild regions of the Ancient World, are full of\r\nstriking accounts of encounters with these monsters, and of the miseries\r\nthey inflict upon the countries cursed with their presence.\r\n\r\n\"In Afric's sunny clime,\" flood, and river, and lake are haunted by the\r\nloathsome and dangerous Crocodile (_Lacerta crocodilus_), one of the\r\nmost powerful species of the Saurian race. Though he preys chiefly on\r\nfish, his capacious jaws will devour any animal that comes within their\r\nreach; and when one reflects that he often attains the length of twenty\r\nto thirty feet, that the upper part of his body is clothed with an\r\nalmost impenetrable scaly armour, that his long, oar-like tail is of\r\nimmense strength, one can readily comprehend the vast amount of\r\ndestruction such a monster can effect. Happily his movements on land are\r\nimpeded by the unwieldiness of his body, which prevents him from turning\r\nexcept with great difficulty, and enables his intended victims to effect\r\ntheir escape. In the water, however, he glides along with great\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nThe female deposits her eggs, which are not much larger than those of a\r\ngoose, in the sand or mud near the banks of the rivers or streams which\r\nshe frequents. By a beneficent provision of Nature, the young are\r\nlargely devoured by birds, ichneumons, and other animals, preventing\r\ntheir otherwise rapid increase. The colour of a full-grown crocodile is\r\na blackish-brown above and yellowish-white beneath, the upper parts of\r\nthe legs and sides being relieved by shades of deep yellow, and in some\r\nplaces tinged with green. The mouth is of vast width, and both jaws\r\nbristle with a terrible array of sharp-pointed teeth.\r\n\r\nThe African species all belong to the same genus, of which the Crocodile\r\nof the Nile is the type.\r\n\r\nAt the Gaboon, the negroes hunt their enemies either with muskets or a\r\nkind of harpoon. Their vulnerable points are the attachment of the\r\nanterior limbs, and, of course, the eyes. It is here that their\r\nassailants endeavour to mark them. They are killed every day without\r\ntheir number appearing to be sensibly diminished, and, what is singular\r\nenough, without their seeming to grow mistrustful. During the heat of\r\nthe noon, they retire among the reeds and rushes for repose, but never\r\nremain long in any one place. At evening and at morning they sally forth\r\nin quest of prey. They swim without making any noise, scarcely\r\ndisturbing the water, which they cleave like dogs; they will also remain\r\nmotionless on its surface, glancing around them with cruel, dull,\r\nsinister eyes. The negro does not feel towards them so great an horror\r\nas Europeans experience, who are powerfully affected by their exceeding\r\nhideousness. They eat their flesh, with which their huge bony skeleton\r\nis scantily furnished, and, according to Du Chaillu, can never obtain\r\nenough of the much-prized delicacy.[127]\r\n\r\nThe Indian Crocodile, the _Gavial_ or _Garial_ (_Crocodilus\r\nGangeticus_), is of the same size as his African congener, but easily\r\ndistinguished by the peculiar conformation of his mouth; the jaws being\r\nremarkably straight, long, and narrow. The sides of the head are\r\nstraight and perpendicular, the upper surface quadrilateral; and the\r\nmandible, instead of sloping gradually from the forehead, sinks suddenly\r\nto follow a straight and almost horizontal direction. The teeth are\r\nnearly double in number those of the Nilotic monster, but he is far less\r\ndangerous, and feeds only on fish. There are two species: the Gavial of\r\nthe Ganges, found in all the great rivers of Southern Asia; and the\r\nGavial of Schlegel, belonging exclusively to the island of Borneo.\r\n\r\nSerpents of every size, venomous and non-venomous, multiply in the\r\njungles, marshes, and woods of all tropical countries. Africa and Asia\r\nare abundantly provided with them. In Senegal they are all, or mostly\r\nall, inoffensive, and the objects of devout worship on the part of the\r\nnegroes of Dahomey; but naturalists have not yet determined their\r\nrespective genera. It is certain, however, that they do not all belong\r\nto the same species. In size, says the French traveller, Dr. Répin, they\r\nvary from three to ten feet. Their head is large, flattened, and\r\ntriangular; the neck not quite so large as the remainder of the body; in\r\nthese respects resembling the entire host of _Ophidia_. They vary in\r\ncolour from a bright yellow to a yellowish-green, according perhaps to\r\ntheir age. Most of them are marked upon the back, for their whole\r\nlength, with two brown lines, while a few are irregularly spotted. The\r\nlong and prehensile tail, and the facility with which some of them\r\nclimb, would refer them probably to the genus _Leptophis_ of Duméril and\r\nBibron. At Whydah, these divinities are lodged in a temple shaded by\r\nlofty and beautiful trees. This curious edifice is described as a kind\r\nof rotunda, from thirty to forty feet in diameter, and from twenty-two\r\nto twenty-five feet high. Its walls, constructed of sunburnt clay, are\r\npierced, like those of the Dahomean houses, by two opposite gates,\r\naffording free ingress and egress to the deities of the place. The roof,\r\nformed of branches curiously interlaced and covered with a layer of\r\ndried grass, is constantly tapestried with a myriad serpents. Some climb\r\nor descend by writhing round the trunks of trees arranged for this\r\npurpose along the walls; others, suspended by the tail, balance\r\nthemselves indifferently in the air; others, again, lie coiled up in\r\nspiral folds on the ground or among the grasses of the temple roof. They\r\nnever want for nourishment; the devout supply them with constant\r\nrenewals of food, and in such abundance, that the priests, who,\r\nmoreover, exercise the double profession of sorcerers and doctors, are\r\nin no greater peril of starvation than their gods!\r\n\r\nThe spotted serpents of which Dr. Répin speaks may possibly be no other\r\nthan _Pythons_, those gigantic Ophidians of the tropical regions of the\r\nOld World which are found in Africa, in India, in the Indian\r\nArchipelago, and even in Australia. It should be noted, however, that\r\ntheir size generally exceeds that of the largest serpents which Dr.\r\nRépin saw at Whydah. Their length is from fifteen to twenty-five\r\nfeet--specimens have been met with measuring thirty--and their maximum\r\ndiameter ranges from ten to twelve inches. Their back is variegated\r\nwith large spots, whose form, colour, and disposition differ according\r\nto their species. The tail is short, and not prehensile. Their favourite\r\nhaunt is the low marshy ground, rank with moist herbage, where they prey\r\nupon birds and small animals, swallowing them whole--swallowing them\r\neven alive--after having seized them in the invincible folds of their\r\nlong sinuous bodies, and always commencing with their hinder parts. So\r\ngreedy a repast must necessarily be followed by a slow and difficult\r\ndigestion, and cannot be renewed at any very brief interval. They eat in\r\neffect but once a month, or once in two months. During the lethargic and\r\nsemi-somnolent condition which invariably follows their debauch, they\r\nfall easy victims to the attacks of their enemies. The principal African\r\nspecies of this genus are, the Python of Seba, of Central Africa, and\r\nthe Royal Python of Senegambia.\r\n\r\nThe species peculiar to Asiatic climes is the Python Molure, a native of\r\nthe Indian Peninsula, and of the islands of Java and Sumatra. The Python\r\nof the Sunda Islands, called by the natives _Ular-Sawa_, attains the\r\nlength of fully thirty feet. It has a large flat head, of a bluish-gray\r\ncolour, a thick yellowish muzzle, and cylindrical neck. Its body is\r\nmarked with deep-blue spots, with a yellow or tawny border; its yellow\r\ntail with blue rings. Its ordinary habitat is the rivers; it feeds on\r\nrats and birds, but also pursues, when ashore, the largest animals.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Dr. Livingstone for much curious information\r\nrespecting the serpents of South Africa, and especially in reference to\r\nthe _Striking Echidna_, a singularly formidable viper, which the negroes\r\ndesignate _Picakolou_. He tells us that he killed one day a reptile of\r\nthis species, which was of a deep brown colour, verging on black, and\r\nmeasured seven feet and a half in length.[128] These reptiles possess so\r\nabundant and deadly a venom, that when one of them is attacked by a band\r\nof dogs, the first dog bitten dies immediately; the second, five minutes\r\nafterwards; the third, at the end of an hour; and the fourth, after a\r\nmore or less lengthened agony. A great number of beasts is annually\r\ndestroyed by the Picakolous; the fangs of an individual killed at\r\nKolobeng distilled poison for several hours after its head had been\r\nsevered from its body. It is probably this plentiful secretion which the\r\nnatives call \"the serpent's spittle,\" and which leads them to suppose\r\nthat the Picakolou is endowed with a power of injecting it into its\r\nenemies' eyes when the wind is favourable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPython Molure.      Echidna, or _Picakolou_.      Fennec (_Megalotis_).]\r\n\r\nOther venomous species exist in this part of Africa, of which several\r\nare vipers, and among others the Puff-Adder (_Vipera inflata_). The\r\nnatives have named it _Noga-Poutsane_, or the Goats' Serpent, because it\r\nmakes at night a bleating exactly resembling that animal. There were\r\ncertainly no goats, says Livingstone, in the place where I happened to\r\nhear it. The natives suppose that by this bleating it hopes to deceive\r\nthe traveller, and draw him within its reach. Some species emit, when\r\nthey are frightened, a peculiar odour, strong enough to indicate their\r\npresence when they have found their way into the huts. There are also\r\nseveral varieties of Cobras (the _Naja-Haje_ of Dr. Smith). When they\r\nare attacked, they raise their head a foot from the ground, extend their\r\nneck in a threatening manner, dart their tongue to and fro with extreme\r\nrapidity, while rage glares in their fixed and glassy eyes.\r\n\r\nDifferent serpents of the genus _Dendrophis_, as, for example, the Green\r\nClimber (_Bucephalus viridis_), scale the trees in search of birds and\r\ntheir eggs, to which they are curiously partial. The Bucephalus is armed\r\nwith fangs; nevertheless it is not venomous, and these fangs, which turn\r\ninwards, are only of use in preventing the retrogression of their prey,\r\nonly one part of which is enclosed between its jaws.\r\n\r\nThe Cobra or Naja (_Vipera naja_), the \"Hooded Snake\" and \"Spectacle\r\nSnake\" of the English, the \"Cobra de Capella\" of the Portuguese, must be\r\nclassed among those serpents which are the most dangerous through their\r\nviolence, and the subtle character of their venom. It is easily\r\nrecognized by its faculty of dilating the back and sides of the neck,\r\nunder the influence of fear or rage, to which it owes its popular\r\nappellation; the elevated skin of the back of the neck presenting much\r\nthe appearance of a hood (_capella_). It is usually three or four feet\r\nin length; of a pale reddish-brown colour above, and bluish or\r\nyellowish-white below; with a characteristic mark on the back of the\r\nneck closely resembling the figure of an old-fashioned pair of\r\nspectacles. It is a sluggish creature, and easily killed, but its poison\r\nis of the most fatal quality, causing death within two hours. It\r\nfrequents the purlieus of human residences in India, and occasionally\r\npenetrates into the very houses, attracted apparently by the domestic\r\npoultry, and by the humidity of the wells and drainage. In Ceylon, the\r\nnatives, if journeying abroad by night, carry a small stick with a loose\r\niron ring, whose strange metallic sound, as they strike it on the earth,\r\nfrightens the cobra from their path. The poison is harmless if taken\r\ninternally. It is secreted in a large gland in the serpent's head, and\r\nflows, when the animal compresses its mouth on any object, through a\r\ncavity of the tooth into the wound.[129]\r\n\r\nThe Indian species plays a conspicuous part in the displays of the Hindu\r\njugglers, who exercise a strange power over them by the tones of their\r\nvoice and the sounds of various musical instruments, compelling them to\r\nrise partially from the ground and go through a succession of fantastic\r\nmovements. Something of this power is also due to the fascination of the\r\njuggler's eye. Serpent-charming is of remote antiquity in Egypt and in\r\nmost Oriental nations, where the profession would seem to be hereditary.\r\nSeveral allusions to it occur in Holy Writ.[130]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE PRAIRIES OF THE NEW WORLD:--HERBIVORA, INSECTIVORA,\r\nAND CARNIVORA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the order of Pachydermata, which furnished the Ancient\r\nWorld with the most gigantic species of the terrestrial creation, is\r\nrepresented in the New World by comparatively insignificant types: the\r\nTapir and the Peccary. The first, although far inferior in stature to\r\nthe elephant, the rhinoceros and the hippopotamus, is, nevertheless, one\r\nof the largest American Herbivora; the bison, llama, and stag alone\r\nexceeding it in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN TAPIR (_Tapirus Americanus_).]\r\n\r\nTwo species are distinguished, which both inhabit South America,--the\r\n_American Tapir_ and the _Tapir Pinchaca_. The former is about as large\r\nas a mule or an ass. His skin is black, covered with rough brown hair.\r\nHe has a long bowed neck, legs and feet resembling those of the hog, and\r\na nose prolonged into a kind of trumpet. He feeds on leaves and many\r\nkinds of fruit, and sometimes does much injury in the mandioca fields\r\nof the Indians. His flesh is very good eating, and considered\r\nexceedingly wholesome. It is even reputed to be a remedy for the ague. A\r\nvery shy and timid animal, he wanders about principally at night. \"When\r\nthe Indian discovers a feeding-place,\" says Mr. Wallace,[131] \"he builds\r\na stage between two trees, about eight feet above the ground, and there\r\nstations himself soon after dusk, armed with a gun, or with his bow and\r\narrow. Though such a heavy animal, the tapir steps as lightly as a cat,\r\nand can only be heard approaching by the gentle rustling of the bushes;\r\nthe slightest sound or smell will alarm him, and the Indian lies still\r\nas death for hours, till the animal approaches sufficiently near to be\r\nshot, or until, scenting his enemy, he makes off in another direction.\"\r\nWhen compelled to stand at bay, however, he defends himself with\r\nextraordinary vigour. D'Azara assures us that if the jaguar flings\r\nhimself upon the tapir, the latter will drag him onward and onward\r\nthrough the densest bushes, until, torn cruelly by the thorns and\r\nbrambles, he is constrained to let his would-be victim escape.\r\n\r\nThe _Tapir Pinchaca_ appears to be confined to the region of the\r\nCordilleran table-lands. The name \"Pinchaca,\" bestowed on the species by\r\nM. Roulin, is that of a fabulous animal mentioned in the traditions of\r\nNew Grenada. It is distinguished from the former species by the absence\r\nof those lateral folds on the snout and occipital ridge to be remarked\r\nin the American Tapir, by its long thick hair--which, however, does not\r\nform a mane on the neck--and by a white mark at the extremity of the\r\nlower jaw.\r\n\r\nThe _Peccaries_ are the wild boars of Tropical America. They are smaller\r\nthan those of the Old World; have fewer teeth, and their tail is\r\nrudimentary. They live in numerous herds, and not only defend themselves\r\nenergetically against aggressors, but when the latter have grown\r\nfatigued, assume the offensive, and pursue them with incredible fury.\r\nHunting them, therefore, is for man, no less than for the jaguar, a\r\ndangerous adventure. When one of them has been seized by the latter, or\r\nslain by the former, the herd combine in pursuit of the murderer, and if\r\nhe does not succeed in escaping them by a rapid retreat, or by opposing\r\nsome insurmountable obstacle to their headlong career, he is infallibly\r\ntorn to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Horse_, or, to adopt the new nomenclature, the family of\r\n_Equidæ_, are altogether wanting in the American Fauna; that is, in the\r\nnative indigenous Fauna of the New World. Previous to the era of Spanish\r\nConquest, America did not possess a single species analagous to the\r\nhorse, the onagra, the hemionus, the zebra, or the quagga; and the\r\nreader of the animated pages of Prescott or Arthur Helps will remember\r\nwith what terror the Peruvians as well as the Mexicans regarded the\r\nmounted cavaliers of Pizarro and Cortez. The horse, however, when\r\nintroduced by Europeans, multiplied rapidly in the Savannahs, where he\r\nsoon became wild, and breeding with the ass, produced the mule, which,\r\nin the Spanish-American States, as in the mother-country, is now the\r\nmost useful auxiliary of man. The European ox is likewise acclimatized\r\nover the entire extent of the new continent; and immense herds of the\r\nlatter species, together with troops of horses and mules, people the\r\nLlanos and Pampas of South America, where the first conquerors had only\r\nmet with herds of stags (_Cervus Mexicanus_), llamas, and cobiais.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNTER PURSUED BY PECCARIES.]\r\n\r\nThe _Llama_, or _Guanaco_ (_Auchenia llama_), and his congeners, the\r\nVicuna and the Alpaca (_Auchenia_), are now only found among the\r\nrecesses of the Andes, their native country, to which they have\r\nretreated before the restless advance of man. In describing them I shall\r\nfreely avail myself of Dr. Von Tschudi's interesting notices.[132]\r\n\r\nThe Llama measures from the sole of the hoof to the top of the head,\r\nfour feet six to eight inches; from the sole of the hoof to the\r\nshoulders, from two feet eleven inches to three feet. The female is\r\nusually smaller and less strong than the male, but her wool is finer and\r\nbetter. A great variety of colour prevails; the more general is brown,\r\nwith shades of yellow or black; frequently speckled, but very rarely\r\nquite white or black. The speckled brown llama is, in some districts,\r\ncalled the moromoro.\r\n\r\nThe burden carried by this useful animal, the camel of the New World,\r\nshould not exceed from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five\r\npounds. If the load be too heavy, he lies down, and no force or\r\npersuasion will induce him to resume his journey until the excess be\r\nremoved. In the silver mines his utility is very great, as he frequently\r\ncarries the metal from the mines in places where the declivities are so\r\nsteep that neither asses nor mules can keep their footing. His\r\nabstemiousness is remarkable, and he will not feed during the night.\r\n\r\n\"A flock of llamas journeying over the table-lands,\" says Dr. Von\r\nTschudi, \"is a beautiful sight. They proceed at a slow and measured\r\npace, gazing eagerly around on every side. When any strange object\r\nscares them, the flock separates, and disperses in various directions,\r\nand the arrieros have no little difficulty in re-assembling them. The\r\nIndians are very fond of these animals. They adorn them by tying bows of\r\nribbons to their ears, and hanging bells round their necks; and before\r\nloading, they always fondle and caress them affectionately. If, during a\r\njourney, one of the llamas is fatigued and lies down, the arriero kneels\r\nbeside the animal, and addresses to it the most coaxing and endearing\r\nexpressions. But notwithstanding all the care and attention bestowed on\r\nthem, many llamas perish on every journey to the coast, as they are not\r\nable to bear the warm climate.\"\r\n\r\nWhen resting they make a peculiar humming noise, which, if it proceed\r\nfrom a numerous flock and is heard at some distance, resembles a concert\r\nof Æolian harps.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the llama is spongy, and not agreeable in flavour: Its wool\r\nis used in manufacturing coarse cloths.\r\n\r\nThe Alpaca (_Auchenia_), or Paco, is smaller than the llama. It measures\r\nonly three feet three inches from the lower part of the hoof to the top\r\nof the head, and to the shoulders two feet and a half. In form it\r\nresembles the sheep, but has a longer neck and a more graceful head. Its\r\nfleece is very long, in some parts four or five inches, and exquisitely\r\nsoft. Its colour is usually either white or black, but in some few\r\ninstances is speckled. Of its wool the Indians weave their blankets. It\r\nis also exported to Europe, and especially to England, in large\r\nquantities, though since the alpaca was naturalized in Australia,\r\nthrough the patriotic exertions of Mr. Ledger, England has begun to\r\nobtain a supply from her great and thriving colony.[133]\r\n\r\nThe alpacas are kept in large flocks, which graze, throughout the year,\r\non the green and level heights, and are driven to the huts only at\r\nshearing-time. Their shyness is very great, and at the approach of a\r\nstranger they take to rapid flight. Their obstinacy is remarkable. If\r\none of these animals should be separated from the flock he will throw\r\nhimself on the ground, and neither force nor persuasion will induce him\r\nto rise; he will frequently suffer the severest punishment rather than\r\ngo the way his driver wishes. Few animals seem to stand in such urgent\r\nneed of the companionship of their species, and it is only when brought\r\nto the Indian huts very young that they can be separated from their\r\nflocks.\r\n\r\nThe largest animal of this tribe is the Huanacu or Guanaco. He measures\r\nfive feet from the bottom of the hoof to the top of the head, and three\r\nfeet three inches to the shoulders. So nearly does he resemble the llama\r\nin form that, until very recently, zoologists supposed the latter to be\r\nan improved species of the huanacu, and that the huanacu was neither\r\nmore nor less than a wild llama. But there are specific differences\r\nbetween them. The huanacu is of a uniform reddish-brown colour on the\r\nneck, back, and thighs. The under part of the body, the middle line of\r\nthe breast, and the inner side of the limbs are of a dingy white. The\r\nwool is shorter and coarser than that of the llama, and of nearly\r\nuniform length on all parts of the body. The huanacus assemble in small\r\nherds of five or seven, and if taken very young may be tamed, but can\r\nwith difficulty be trained as beasts of burden.\r\n\r\nThe Vicuña is a more beautiful animal than either of the preceding. His\r\nsize is a medium between that of the llama and alpaca. He measures four\r\nfeet one inch to the top of the head, and two feet six inches to the top\r\nof the shoulders. He is distinguished by his longer and shapelier neck,\r\nby the superior fineness of his short curly wool. The crown of the head,\r\nthe upper part of the neck, the back, and thighs are of a peculiar\r\nreddish-yellow hue, which the natives call _color de vicuña_. The lower\r\npart of the neck and the inner parts of the limbs are of a bright\r\nochreous colour, and the breast and lower part of the body white.\r\n\r\nDuring the wet season the vicuña browses on the scanty vegetation of the\r\nCordilleran ridges. He never ventures up to the bare rocky summits, for\r\nhis hoofs, being accustomed only to the yielding sward, are very soft\r\nand tender. He lives in herds, consisting of from six to fifteen\r\nfemales, and one male, who is the protector and leader of the herd, and\r\nwho, while the females graze, stands a few paces apart, carefully\r\nwatching over their safety. At the approach of danger he gives a signal,\r\nconsisting of a kind of whistling sound and a quick movement of the\r\nfoot. Immediately the herd draws close together, each animal stretching\r\nout his head in the direction of the impending alarm. Then they take to\r\nflight; first moving leisurely and cautiously, but quickening their pace\r\nto the utmost degree of speed; whilst the male vicuña, who covers the\r\nretreat, occasionally halts to observe the motions of the enemy. The\r\nfemales reward his devotion by the warmest affection and fidelity, and\r\nwill suffer themselves to be killed or captured rather than desert him.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the Indians hunt the vicuña is sufficiently curious.\r\nIn the _Chacu_, as it is termed, the whole company, seventy or eighty in\r\nnumber, proceed to the Attos--the most secluded districts of the\r\nPeruvian mountains--which are the animal's favourite haunts, with an\r\nabundant supply of rope and cord, and numerous stakes. Selecting a\r\nspacious open area, they drive the stakes into the ground in a circle,\r\nat intervals of from twelve to fifteen feet apart, and connect them\r\ntogether by ropes fastened at the height of two or two and a half feet\r\nfrom the ground. The circular space within this enclosure measures about\r\nhalf a league in circumference; an opening of about two hundred paces in\r\nwidth is left for entrance. On the ropes which are carried round the\r\nstakes, the Indian women hang pieces of coloured rag that flutter gaily\r\nin the wind.\r\n\r\nThe chacu being thus made ready, the Indians, who are mounted on\r\nhorseback, range over the country within a circuit of several miles,\r\ndriving before them all the herds of vicuñas they encounter, and forcing\r\nthem into the chacu. When a sufficient number is collected, they close\r\nthe entrance. The timid animals do not attempt to leap over the ropes,\r\nbeing affrighted by the fluttering rags, and when thus secured, the\r\nIndians easily kill them with their _bolas_.\r\n\r\nThese bolas consist of three balls, composed either of lead or stone;\r\ntwo of them heavier than the third. They are fastened to long elastic\r\nstrings, made of twisted sinews of the vicuña, and the opposite ends of\r\nthe strings are all tied together. The Indian holds the lightest of the\r\nthree balls in his hand, and swings the two others in a wide circle\r\nabove his head; then, taking his aim at the distance of about fifteen\r\nor twenty paces, he lets go the hand-ball, whereupon all three whirl in\r\na circle, and cling round the object aimed at. The aim is usually\r\ndirected at the animal's hind legs, and the cords twisting round them,\r\nhe is unable to move. Great skill and long practice are required to\r\nthrow the bolas dexterously; a novice in the art incurs the risk of\r\ndangerously hurting either himself or his horse, by not giving the balls\r\nthe proper swing, or by letting go the hand-ball too soon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Guanaco. 2. Llama. 3. Vicuña.]\r\n\r\nThe vicuñas, after being secured by the bolas, are killed; their skins\r\nbelong to the Church, and their flesh, which is tenderer and better\r\nflavoured than that of the llama, is distributed in equal portions among\r\nthe hunters.\r\n\r\nUnder the dynasty of the Incas, the Peruvians rendered almost divine\r\nworship to the llama and his congeners, adorning the temples with large\r\nfigures of these animals fashioned in gold and silver.[134]\r\n\r\nIf the natives of the South American continent possess neither the Ox\r\nnor the Sheep, they have at least a precious resource in the Bison, and\r\nthe Musk Ox, or Ovibos. Of the latter I shall speak when my survey\r\nbrings me to the colder regions of North America.\r\n\r\nThe Bison is wholly confined to the great prairies of this continent,\r\nwhich he traverses from north to south, and reciprocally, in his\r\nperiodical migrations. According to some naturalists, he is a variety of\r\nthe Aurochs, the fierce wild bull that formerly tenanted the forests of\r\nGaul, Germany, and Sarmatia, and is still found in the densely-wooded\r\ndistricts of Moldavia, Wallachia, Lithuania, and Caucasia. Herds of\r\nAurochs (_Bos Bison_), under the special protection of the Russian\r\nEmperor, and believed to number fully eight hundred animals, still roam\r\nin the depths of the great Lithuanian forest of Bialowieza. The American\r\ngenus commonly called Buffalo, but not to be confounded with the\r\nbuffaloes of the Old World, occurs as far north as the Great Martin\r\nLake, in latitude 63°, and congregates in countless thousands on the\r\nwide undulating prairies between the Mississippi and the Rocky\r\nMountains. Their flesh is supposed to supply with provision some 300,000\r\nIndians, who pursue them on horseback, and kill them with bow and arrow,\r\nspear or rifle. The chase is exciting, and has proved a great attraction\r\nto the more adventurous spirits of the New World. It is exciting because\r\nit is perilous, for the hunted animal will often turn upon his\r\nadversary, and in speed he can outstrip the swiftest horse. He finds a\r\nformidable enemy in the white wolf. Hunting in packs of one or two\r\nhundred, the latter fling themselves upon two or three solitary bisons,\r\nand, surrounding them, worry the huge brutes to death. Never have they\r\ncourage enough, however, to attack a herd, though the latter, when they\r\ncatch sight of wolves, manifest the greatest alarm, form into battle\r\narray, and are only prevented by excess of terror from taking to flight.\r\nThis panic-stricken feeling the Indian often turns to his advantage. He\r\nclothes himself in the skin of a white wolf, and with bow and arrows in\r\nhis hands, boldly faces a herd, crawling towards them on his hands and\r\nknees; the affrighted buffaloes press closely together to receive the\r\nsupposed wolf, who, on arriving at a convenient proximity, suddenly\r\nsprings to his feet, and utters an unearthly yell. They fall into a\r\nfrenzy of terror which enables him to select several victims.\r\n\r\nThe Indians also capture great numbers by setting fire to the grass of\r\nthe prairies; the flames compel them to retire to the centre, where they\r\nare easily slain. Or they endeavour to throw them into a panic of alarm,\r\nin which case they seem possessed with a sudden madness, and, if driven\r\ntowards a precipice, will dash themselves headlong over it, falling\r\ncrushed and bleeding into the chasm beneath.\r\n\r\nThe American bison is similar to the European, but his tail and limbs\r\nare shorter; the horns are shorter and more blunt; the tail has fewer\r\nvertebræ; and the mane is fuller and shaggier. His flesh is excellent\r\neating, having a flavour like that of venison. The tallow forms an\r\nimportant article of trade, one bull sometimes yielding 150 pounds. The\r\nskins are much used by the Indians for blankets, and when tanned they\r\nemploy them as coverings for their beds and wigwams. Spread upon frames\r\nof wicker-work, they make admirable canoes. The long hair or fleece, of\r\nwhich a male bison yields six to eight pounds, is spun and woven into\r\ncloth.\r\n\r\nThe favourite nourishment of the bison, says Humboldt, is the _Tripsacum\r\ndactyloides_, called \"Buffalo-Grass\" in North Carolina, and a species of\r\ntrefoil, resembling _Trifolium repens_, which Burton has named\r\n_Trifolium bisonicum_. It is remarkable, he continues, that the Buffalo,\r\nor Bison of the North, has exercised an influence upon geographical\r\ndiscovery in the mountainous regions where no road is laid down.\r\nAssembled in herds of several thousands, and seeking a milder climate,\r\nthey migrate at the approach of winter into the countries situated south\r\nof Arkansas. Their massive form and size render it difficult for them to\r\ncross the mountains; and, consequently, wherever the traveller finds a\r\ntrack beaten out by numerous hoofs--a \"buffalo-path,\" in fact--he may\r\nconfidently adopt it as the most convenient route for himself and his\r\nsteed. In this manner have been discovered the best passes in the\r\nCumberland Mountains, the Rocky Mountains, from the sources of the\r\nYellow-Stone to the River La Plata; and, finally, from the southern\r\nbranch of the River Columbia to the Rio Colorado of California.\r\n\r\nThe animals which we most frequently meet with in the Steppes of South\r\nAmerica are the small spotted Stag (_Cervus Mexicanus_); the mailed\r\nArmadillos; some species of Tatous, which glide like rats into the\r\nburrows of the hares; troops of indolent Cobiais; of Civets agreeably\r\nstriped, but infecting the air with their emanations; and the great\r\nmaneless Lion, the Jaguar or American Tiger, whose strength is\r\nsufficient to slay the young bulls and carry them off to the summits of\r\nthe hills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Agouti. 2. Capybara.]\r\n\r\nThe _Cervus Mexicanus_ wanders in numerous troops in the grassy Llanos\r\nof the Caraccas. He is only spotted while young; and varieties\r\ncompletely white have been discovered. On the slopes of the Andes he is\r\nnever found at a greater elevation than 1600 to 1900 feet. At 3000 feet\r\nhe is replaced by a much larger variety, slightly differing from the\r\nEuropean stag.\r\n\r\nThe Rodents of the genera Capybara, Agouti, and Paca, are widely\r\ndiffused over the plains of Tropical America. Of the three, the Capybara\r\n(_Hydrochærus capybara_) is the largest. He attains the size of a sheep,\r\nhas a voluminous head, small round ears, eyes large and black, a thick\r\ndivided nose flanked by formidable whiskers, a short neck, a thick body\r\ncovered with short, coarse, russet hair, and short legs; altogether,\r\n_not_ a \"thing of beauty.\" Like the peccary, he is tailless, and in a\r\nmanner web-footed, being thus adapted for a semi-aquatic life.\r\n\r\nThese great Rodents, says the illustrious author of \"The Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" in one of his earlier works,[135] are generally called\r\n\"_Carpinchos_;\" they occasionally frequent the islands in the mouth of\r\nthe Plata, where the water is quite salt, but are more abundant on the\r\nborders of fresh-water lakes and rivers. In the day-time they either lie\r\namong the aquatic plants, or openly feed on the turf plain. When viewed\r\nat a distance, from their manner of walking and colour, they resemble\r\npigs; but when seated on their haunches, and attentively watching any\r\nobject with one eye, they re-assume the appearance of their congeners,\r\nthe Caries. Both the front and side view of their head wears quite a\r\nludicrous aspect, from the great depth of their jaw.\r\n\r\nThe Capybara leads no joyous life apparently, for in the water he is\r\nperseveringly pursued by the crocodile, and in the plain by the jaguar.\r\nHe runs so awkwardly as to be easily caught by hand, and the South\r\nAmericans profess to relish his flesh.\r\n\r\nThe Paca (_Coelogenys_) differs from the Capybara in the complex\r\nstructure of his molar teeth. He inhabits the woody regions of South\r\nAmerica, where he is generally found in the vicinity of water,\r\nconcealing himself in burrows so near the surface, that the pedestrian's\r\nfoot often intrudes within them. His form is thick and clumsy, spotted\r\nwith white on the sides, and intermediate in size and appearance between\r\na hog and a hare.[136] He is about a foot in height and two feet in\r\nlength, with hind limbs much longer than the fore, but considerably\r\nbent. The claws are thick, strong, and conical; the eyes large,\r\nprominent, and of a brownish hue; the ears nearly naked, and whiskers\r\nrigid. The paca is heavy and corpulent, but swims and dives with\r\nremarkable agility. As he feeds only on fruits and tender plants, his\r\nflesh is exceedingly savoury, and a staple dish in many parts of\r\nAmerica. His burrow is provided with three apertures, and his capture is\r\nmanaged by closing up two of these, and digging up the third.\r\n\r\nThe Agouti (_Dasyprocta Agouti_) is another South American Rodent, about\r\none-third the size of the Paca; he swims, but does not dive. He has\r\nsometimes been named \"the rabbit of the South American continent,\" but\r\ndiffers from it in many essential points, and really belongs to the\r\n_Cavidæ_, or guinea-pig tribe. He possesses the voracious appetite of\r\nthe hog, and devours indiscriminately everything that comes in his way.\r\nHe conveys his food to his mouth with his fore-paws, like a squirrel,\r\nand as he has long hind legs, runs, or rather leaps, with considerable\r\nswiftness. He is hunted very perseveringly on account of the devastation\r\nhe causes among the sugar-canes. There is a larger species called the\r\n_Mara_, or Pampas Hare (_Dasyprocta Patachonica_), which will wander for\r\nmiles away from its home.\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting Rodents of the New World must be classed the\r\nVizcacha and the Chinchilla, whose furs are so highly valued. The\r\nVizcacha, or Bizcacha (_Calomys bizcacha_), somewhat resembles a rabbit,\r\nbut his teeth are larger, and he has a long tail. He lives, it is said,\r\non roots, and never wanders far from his burrow. His flesh, when cooked,\r\nis very white and savoury. The Chinchilla (_C. lanigera_) inhabits the\r\ncold mountain-valleys, where his close, fine gray fur is an invaluable\r\nprotection. He is a pretty animal, much like the rabbit, but with a\r\nsquirrel's tail; of a mild and sociable disposition; and living with his\r\nkind on the most amicable terms.\r\n\r\nNor must the Beaver be forgotten, the most industrial animal of the\r\nRodentia, which has wholly disappeared from Europe, and is yearly\r\ngrowing scarcer in America.\r\n\r\nThe Beaver (_Castor fiber_) is specially recognizable by his broad\r\nhorizontally-flattened tail, which is of a nearly oval form, but\r\nslightly convex on its upper surface, and covered with scales. His hind\r\nfeet are webbed, and together with the tail, which acts as a rudder,\r\npropel him through the water with ease and swiftness. His length,\r\nexclusive of his tail, which measures one foot, is about three feet;\r\ncolour, a deep chestnut; hair, very fine, glossy, and smooth. The\r\nincisor teeth are large, and so hard, that the North American Indians\r\nused them in fabricating their horn-tipped spears and cutting bone,\r\nuntil iron tools were introduced from Europe.\r\n\r\nThe sagacity with which he constructs his habitation has long been a\r\ntheme of eulogy, and has furnished moralists with many an apt image and\r\npregnant illustration. Water is the necessity of his life. It is\r\nindispensably necessary that the stream near which the animal lives\r\nshould never run dry; and to prevent so dire a misfortune, he is gifted\r\nwith an instinct which teaches him to keep the water at or about the\r\nsame mark, by building a dam across the channel.\r\n\r\nIn order to comprehend the art with which this dam is constructed, we\r\nmust watch the beaver at his patient toil.[137]\r\n\r\nWhen the animal has fixed upon a tree which he believes suitable for his\r\npurpose, he sits upright, and with his chisel-like teeth cuts a bold\r\ngroove completely round the trunk. He then widens the groove in exact\r\nproportion to its depth, so that when the tree is nearly cut through, it\r\nsomewhat resembles the \"contracted portion of an hour-glass.\" When this\r\nstage has been reached, he looks anxiously at the tree, and views it on\r\nevery side, as if to measure the direction in which it should fall.\r\nHaving settled this question, he goes to the opposite side, and with two\r\nor three powerful bites cuts away the wood, so that the overbalanced\r\ntree comes to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe beaver next proceeds to cut it up into lengths of about a yard or\r\nso, employing a similar method of severing the wood. The next part of\r\nthe task is to make these rounded and pointed logs into a dam. For this\r\npurpose the logs are laid horizontally, and covered with stones and\r\nearth until they can resist the force of the water. Vast numbers are\r\nthus laid; and as fast as the water rises, fresh materials are added,\r\nbeing obtained mostly from the trunks and branches of trees which have\r\nbeen stripped of their bark by the beavers.\r\n\r\nIn those places where the stream runs slowly the dam is carried straight\r\nacross the river; but where the current is strong, a convex shape is\r\ngiven to it, so as to resist the force of the rushing water. The dam is\r\nfrequently of great size, measuring two or three hundred yards in\r\nlength, and ten or twelve feet in thickness. In many localities the\r\nstreams have been diverted by these erections into entirely different\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nIt is in this manner that the beavers keep the water to the required\r\nlevel; we must next see how they make use of it. They build their houses\r\nclose to the water, and communicating with it by means of subterranean\r\npassages, one entrance of which passes into the house, or \"lodge,\" as it\r\nis technically named, and the other into the water, so far below the\r\nsurface that it cannot be closed by ice. It is, therefore, always\r\npossible for the beaver to gain access to the provision stores, and to\r\nreturn to its house, without being perceived from the land.\r\n\r\n\"The lodges,\" says Mr. Wood, \"are nearly circular in form, and much\r\nresemble the well-known snow-houses of the Esquimaux, being domed, and\r\nabout half as high as they are wide--the average height being three\r\nfeet, and the diameter six or seven feet. These are the interior\r\ndominions, the exterior measurement being much greater, on account of\r\nthe great thickness of the walls, which are continually strengthened\r\nwith mud and branches, so that during the severe frosts they are nearly\r\nas hard as solid stone. Each lodge will accommodate several inhabitants,\r\nwhose beds are arranged round the walls.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no animal, however, whose sagacity can foil human ingenuity.\r\nThe trappers, who hunt the beaver for the sake of his fur, and the\r\npeculiar odoriferous secretion called _castor_, are more than a match\r\nfor all his artifices. Not even in winter-time is he safe from their\r\npursuit. Striking the ice smartly, they judge from the sound whether\r\nthey are near an aperture; and as soon as they are satisfied, cut away\r\nthe ice and stop up the opening, so that the beavers, if alarmed, may\r\nnot escape into the water. They then proceed to the shore, and by\r\nrepeated soundings trace the course of the beavers' subterranean\r\npassage, which is sometimes eight or ten yards long, and by closely\r\nwatching the different apertures invariably catch the inhabitants. While\r\nthus engaged, they must be careful not to spill any blood, as in case of\r\nsuch a mishap the rest of the beavers take alarm, retreat to the water,\r\nand cannot be captured. The trappers entertain a superstitious notion,\r\nwhich leads them to remove a kneecap from each beaver and throw it into\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nThe beavers generally quit their huts in the summer-time, though one or\r\ntwo of the houses may be tenanted by a mother and her young family.\r\nThose old beavers which are free from domestic ties take to the water,\r\nand swim up and down the stream in bachelor-like liberty until the month\r\nof August, when they return to a settled life. There are, also, certain\r\nindividuals called by the trappers \"_les paresseux_,\" or \"the idlers,\"\r\nwhich do not live in houses, and construct no dam, but dwell in\r\nsubterranean tunnels like those of our common water-rat. They are always\r\nmales; gay young bachelors, with no incentives, we will suppose, to an\r\nindustrious career. Neither in the beaver nor in the human world,\r\nhowever, does idleness prosper, for the capture of \"les paresseux\" is a\r\ncomparatively easy task.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSouth America is the home of those singular Edentate Mammals, with scaly\r\nshields, which the natives call _Tatous_, but which are better known to\r\nEuropeans by the name of _Armadillos_ (_Priodonta gigas_). Cuvier has\r\ndivided the whole genus into five groups, distinguished from one another\r\nby the number and form of their teeth and claws:--\"Cachecames,\" \"Apars,\"\r\n\"Encouberts,\" \"Cabassous,\" and \"Priodontes.\" Their general\r\ncharacteristics, however, are the same, and to describe one is virtually\r\nto describe all.\r\n\r\nThe body of the Armadillo has been invested by nature with a complete\r\nsuit of armour: thus the head is protected by an oval or triangular\r\nplate, the shoulders by a large buckler, and the haunches by a similar\r\nbuckler; while between these solid portions intervenes a series of\r\ntransverse bands, or zones of shell, which accommodate this coat of mail\r\nto the various postures of the body; the tail also is covered by a\r\nseries of calcareous rings, so that the animal exhibits a peculiar and\r\nsomewhat ungainly appearance. Like the hedgehog, he can roll himself up\r\ninto a ball, and present a solid impervious substance to the attacks of\r\nany adversary. The interior surface of the body, not covered by the\r\nshell, is clothed with coarse scattered hairs, some of which also emerge\r\nbetween the joints of the coat of mail.\r\n\r\nThis strange quadruped, like a mediæval knight,--\r\n\r\n    \"In armour sheathed from top to toe,\"--\r\n\r\nhas a rather pointed snout, long ears, short and thick limbs, and stout\r\nclaws. Nature has thus fitted him by a peculiarly admirable organization\r\nfor those habits of burrowing, which he performs with such astonishing\r\nrapidity that it is almost impossible to capture him by digging. His\r\nhunters therefore smoke him out of his subterraneous lair; as soon as he\r\nreaches the surface he rolls himself up, and is easily taken prisoner.\r\nHe is then roasted in his shell, and devoured with avidity, his flesh\r\nbeing as great a dainty to a South American Indian as turtle to a London\r\nalderman.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the armadillos we may place another individual of the\r\nEdentata, not less strange in form: this is the _Tamanoir_, or Great\r\nAnt-Eater (_Myrmecophaga jubata_), which feeds exclusively on ants,\r\ndigging open their hills with his powerful crooked claws, and drawing\r\nhis long flexible tongue, covered with viscous saliva, lightly over the\r\nmyriad insects that immediately sally forth to defend their homes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Armadillo Loricata. 2. Ant-Eater.]\r\n\r\n\"The habits of the Myrmecophaga jubata are now pretty well known. It is\r\nnot uncommon in the drier forests of the Amazons valley. The Brazilians\r\ncall the species the _Tamanduá bandeira_, or the Banner Ant-Eater; the\r\nterm banner,\" says Mr. Bates,[138] \"being applied in allusion to the\r\ncurious coloration of the animal, each side of the body having a broad\r\noblique stripe, half gray and half black, which gives it some\r\nresemblance to a heraldic banner. It has an excessively long, slender\r\nmuzzle, and a warm-like extensile tongue. Its jaws are destitute of\r\nteeth. The claws are much elongated, and its gait is very awkward. It\r\nlives on the ground, but all the other species of this singular genus\r\nare arboreal. I met with four species altogether. One was the\r\n_Myrmecophaga tetradactyla_, or Little Ant-Eater; the two others, more\r\ncurious and less known, were very small kinds, called _Tamanduá-i_\r\n(_Myrmecophaga tamandua_). Both are similar in size--ten inches in\r\nlength, exclusive of the tail--and in the number of the claws, having\r\ntwo of unequal length to the anterior feet, and four to the hind feet.\r\nOne species is clothed with grayish-yellow silky hair; this is of rare\r\noccurrence. The other has a fur of a dingy brown colour, without silky\r\nlustre. One was brought to me alive, having been caught by an Indian\r\nclinging motionless inside a hollow tree. I kept it in the house about\r\ntwenty-four hours. It had a moderately long snout, curved downwards, and\r\nextremely small eyes. It remained nearly all the time without motion,\r\nexcept when irritated, in which case it reared itself on its hind-legs\r\nfrom the back of a chair to which it clung, and clawed out with its\r\nfore-paws like a cat. Its manner of clinging with its claws, and the\r\nsluggishness of its motions, gave it a great resemblance to a sloth. It\r\nuttered no sound, and remained all night on the spot where I had placed\r\nit in the morning. The next day I put it on a tree in the open air, and\r\nat night it escaped. These small Tamanduás are nocturnal in their\r\nhabits, and feed on those species of termites which construct earthy\r\nnests, that look like ugly excrescences on the trunks and branches of\r\ntrees. The different kinds of ant-eaters are thus adapted to various\r\nmodes of life, terrestrial and arboreal.\"\r\n\r\nIn Tropical America the most remarkable representatives of the Carnivora\r\nare two great species of Felidæ: the Puma, or Cougouar (_Felis\r\nconcolor_), also called the Lion of America; and the Jaguar, or Ounce\r\n(_Felis onca_), sometimes distinguished as the American Tiger.\r\n\r\nThe Puma measures about five feet from nose to tail; the tail alone\r\nmeasuring two feet and a half. His colour is a brownish-red, with small\r\npatches of deeper tint, only shown up by certain lights; the breast,\r\nbelly, and inner flanks are of a reddish ash; the lower jaw and throat\r\nentirely white; the tail of a dusky ferruginous tinge, tipped with\r\nblack. As he grows older, however, his general colour becomes a silvery\r\nfawn. He has no mane. His manners--that is, his habits and\r\ndisposition--are rather those of the panther than the lion. He climbs\r\ntrees with cat-like expertness, whether in chase of birds, or to secure\r\na vantage-point from which he may pounce upon some unsuspecting victim.\r\nHe never attacks the larger quadrupeds, confining himself to such \"small\r\ndeer\" as young calves, colts, and sheep. Men, children, dogs--these he\r\nsuffers to pass by unmolested. His depredations are nocturnal. When\r\ndomesticated, he may well be likened to the common cat, and he shows his\r\npleasure at being caressed by the same kind of gentle purring. But he is\r\na ferocious animal, and will kill fifty sheep or more in order to drink\r\ntheir blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUGOUARS, OR PUMAS.]\r\n\r\nA much more formidable animal is the Jaguar. In size and strength he is\r\nbut little inferior to the tiger. He has a large and rounded head; his\r\npliant body is marked on the back with long uninterrupted stripes, on\r\nthe legs and thighs with full black spots; his ground colour is a pale\r\nbrownish-yellow; his legs are short, thick, and robust. He extends his\r\nravages over all Central and South America, and over a considerable\r\nrange of the northern continent. Like the tiger, he loves the shade of\r\nhot swampy jungles, the neighbourhood of the river and the lake. He\r\ngenerally preys on animals of domestic origin, which have grown wild in\r\nthe prairies and the pampas, but he will also attack the bisons, and the\r\nother herbivora. Fish, too, he does not disdain to eat; and in default\r\nof other food, will even seize upon the caïmans. It is rare that he\r\nattacks man; but if attacked by him, he defends himself courageously,\r\nand his muscular strength renders him exceedingly formidable. Not even\r\nan Ajax could maintain a combat with him as Fitz-James fought with\r\nRoderick Dhu, when--\r\n\r\n    \"Foot, and point, and eye opposed,\r\n     In dubious strife they darkly closed;\"\r\n\r\nif man would win, he must arm himself with bow and arrow, keen spear, or\r\nunerring rifle. The hunter, thus provided, pursues him with restless\r\nanimosity to obtain his fur, which is much esteemed in commerce, where\r\nit is improperly designated by the names of \"Great Panther,\" and\r\n\"American Tiger.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISON ATTACKED BY A JAGUAR.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Humboldt, the Pampas are colonized with dogs grown wild,\r\nwhich gather in great numbers in subterranean caverns, and oftentimes,\r\nwhen stimulated by hunger, fling themselves upon man, in whose defence\r\nthey originally displayed their courage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRAIRIE WOLVES (_Arctomys Ludoricianus_).]\r\n\r\nIn North America there exists a very curious species of Rodents,\r\nbelonging to the sub-genus _Spermophilus_, or _Spermatophilus_--that is,\r\n\"grain-eaters.\" They are better known by the hunter's name, \"Prairie\r\nDogs.\" Mr. Murray remarks that it is difficult to say _why_ they\r\nobtained such an absurd appellation, for they do not bear the slightest\r\nresemblance to the canine species, either in formation or habits.[139]\r\n\"In size,\" he says, \"they vary extremely, but in general they are not\r\nlarger than a squirrel, and not unlike one in appearance, except that\r\nthey want his bushy tail; the head is also somewhat rounder. They burrow\r\nunder the light soil, and throw it up round the entrance to their\r\ndwelling like the English rabbit; on this little mound they generally\r\nsit, chirping and chattering to one another, like two neighbour gossips\r\nin a village. Their number is incredible, and their cities (for they\r\ndeserve no less a name) full of activity and bustle. I do not know what\r\ntheir occupations are; but I have seen them constantly running from one\r\nhole to another, although they do not ever pay any distant visits. They\r\nseem on the approach of danger always to retire to their own homes; but\r\ntheir great delight apparently consists in braving it, with the usual\r\ninsolence of cowardice when secure from punishment; for, as you\r\napproach, they wag their little tails, elevate their heads, and chatter\r\nat you like a monkey, louder and louder the nearer you come; but no\r\nsooner is the hand raised to any missile, whether gun, arrow, stick, or\r\nstone, than they pop into the hole with a rapidity only equalled by that\r\nsudden disappearance of Punch, with which, when a child, I have been so\r\nmuch delighted in the streets and squares of London.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Murray observes that as there is generally neither rain nor dew\r\non the plains which they inhabit, during the summer, while, on the other\r\nhand, these little creatures never wander far from their \"towns,\" it\r\nseems reasonable to conclude they need no other liquid than they can\r\nextract from the grass they eat. It is certain that they pass the winter\r\nin a complete state of lethargy and torpor, for they accumulate no\r\nsupply of provisions against that season; while the herbage which\r\nthrives about their habitat dries up in autumn, and soon afterwards the\r\nfrosts render it impossible for them to procure their ordinary food.\r\nWhen the prairie dog feels the approach of his time of somnolence--generally\r\nabout the end of October--he closes all the passages of his dormitory to\r\nprotect him from the cold, and wholly resigns himself to the pleasures\r\nof repose. He remains thus immured and inert until awakened by the first\r\nwarm airs of spring, when he throws wide his gates and reappears on the\r\nsurface of the refreshened earth, in all his whilome liveliness and\r\ngaiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE PRAIRIES OF THE NEW WORLD:--BIRDS AND REPTILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in a preceding chapter that the great terrestrial and\r\naquatic birds (\"Waders\") of the wild plains of the Ancient World have\r\nfew analogues in America, and that the small number of genera which are\r\nrepresented therein are represented by much smaller species. I have\r\ncited the Ostrich and the Phenicopterus. The American Ostrich, or Nandou\r\n(_Rhea_), is not above half the size of his African congener, from which\r\nhe differs in having the feet three-toed, and each toe armed with a\r\nclaw. Moreover, his head and neck are more fully clothed with plumage;\r\nthe wings are plumed, and more perfectly developed; and he is tailless.\r\nThe neck has sixteen vertebræ. Though endowed with more perfect wings\r\nthan the Ostrich of Africa, he is nevertheless incapable of flight,\r\nrepresenting another grade in Nature's slow ascent from the wingless\r\nbird to the bird possessed of full powers of flight. He inhabits the\r\nwide grassy plains of South America below the Equator, and as far south\r\nas latitude 42°. He is never seen across the Cordilleras, but roams in\r\ngreat numbers the banks of La Plata and its tributaries. He is generally\r\nseen in small troops.\r\n\r\nThere are at least three species: the _Rhea Americana_, about five feet\r\nhigh; the _Rhea macrorhyncha_, distinguished by its large bill; and the\r\n_Rhea Darwinii_, the smallest, which inhabits Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe Flamingoes proper to the New World are: the Red Flamingo, all whose\r\nplumage glows with a more or less vivid red; and the Fiery Flamingo,\r\nprobably only a variety of the preceding. Both are natives of the dreary\r\nPatagonian desert, of Chili, and some other southern districts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Cathartes-Urubu. 2. King of the Vultures.]\r\n\r\nThe order of Waders, and that of Palmipeds, include, in the low marshy\r\nlevels of this continent, some characteristic species: notably, the\r\nJacanas and the Kamichis; the Agami or Trumpet-Bird, remarkable for its\r\npastoral instinct, its domestic aptitudes, and the ringing sound of its\r\nvoice; the Savacou, which, in the structure of its enormous beak and its\r\ngeneral habits, is allied to the African Balæniceps. Here, as in Africa,\r\na species of rapacious Grallator flourishes, the _Cariama_, delivering\r\n\"a war to the knife\" against the reptile legions. Raptores more\r\naccurately defined--such, for example, as the _Falco cachinnans_, or\r\nLaughing Vulture--share in the destructive campaign against frogs,\r\ntoads, lizards, and small serpents. And in the New, as in the Old World,\r\nNature does not neglect the work of purification, intrusting it in the\r\nsavannahs and the pampas to various kinds of Vulturidæ, which devour the\r\nputrid carcasses that would otherwise pollute the atmosphere. The\r\n_Cathartes-Urubu_ and the _Aura_ are the most common species; the\r\nMexicans call them _Zopilotes_. They are found in all Central and\r\nSouthern America, and frequently range to very high latitudes. They are\r\nof small size, very social, easy familiarized with man, and may be seen\r\nin great numbers, not alone in the deserts and plains, but in the great\r\ntowns, where they efficiently play the part of great sanitary reformers.\r\nThey are gifted with extraordinary delicacy of scent; they detect the\r\nexistence of carrion at great distances, and flock from the four\r\nquarters of heaven to banquet upon it. The _Sarcoramphus Papa_, or \"King\r\nof the Vultures,\" a species closely allied to the great Condor of the\r\nAndes, is likewise encountered very frequently in the plains of Tropical\r\nAmerica, but only where the herbage has been set on fire; which is a\r\ncommon enough occurrence, either through lightning, or by accident or\r\ndesign on the part of the Indians. Then he arrives on rapid pinion to\r\nprey upon the lizards, and frogs, and serpents which are destroyed by\r\nthe scathing and consuming flames. His attire is more elegant than his\r\nmission in creation would seem to render necessary. The plumage on the\r\nupper part of the body is of a reddish hue, the neck and head of a\r\ndelicate bluish-violet, the beak red, the crest orange, the eyebrows\r\nwhite, and the wings black. He is about the size of the domestic\r\nTurkey. The tawny _Caracara_, a bird of the genus _Polyborus_, as large\r\nas the common Kite, and with a tail nine inches long; and the _Harpy\r\nEagle_ (Thrasaëtus), distinguished by its formidable beak and legs, its\r\nerect crest and flashing eyes--both widely distributed in all the hot\r\nregions of the New World--belong to the _Falconidæ_ family (in the\r\nlatest classification), as well as the great white-headed Fishing Eagle,\r\nor Pygargue (_Haliaëtus Leucocephalus_), which inhabits the northern\r\ncontinent. The latter has been eloquently described by the Paisley\r\nornithologist, the celebrated Wilson:[140]--\"Elevated on the high dead\r\nbranch of some gigantic tree that commands a wide view of the\r\nneighbouring shore and ocean, he seems calmly to contemplate the motions\r\nof the various feathered tribes that pursue their busy avocations below;\r\nall the winged multitudes that subsist by the bounty of this vast liquid\r\nmagazine of Nature. High over all these hovers one whose action\r\ninstantly arrests his attention. By his wide curvature of wing and\r\nsudden suspension in the air, he knows him to be the Fish Hawk, settling\r\nover some devoted victim of the deep. His eye kindles at the sight, and,\r\nbalancing himself with half-opened wings on the branch, he watches the\r\nresult. Down, rapid as an arrow from heaven, descends the distant object\r\nof his attention, the roar of his wings reaching the ear as he\r\ndisappears in the deep, making the surges foam around! At this moment,\r\nthe eager looks of the eagle are all ardour, and, levelling his neck for\r\nflight, he sees the fish hawk emerge struggling with his prey, and\r\nmounting in the air with screams of exultation. These are the signals\r\nfor our hero, who, launching into the air, instantly gives chase, and\r\nsoon gains on the hawk; each exerts his utmost to mount above the other,\r\ndisplaying in these rencounters the most elegant and sublime aërial\r\nevolutions. The unencumbered eagle rapidly advances, and is just on the\r\npoint of reaching his opponent, when, with a sudden scream, probably of\r\ndespair and honest execration, the latter drops the fish; the eagle,\r\npoising himself for a moment, as if to take a more certain aim, descends\r\nlike a whirlwind, snatches it in his grasp ere it reaches the water, and\r\nbears his ill-gotten booty silently away to the woods.\"\r\n\r\nA similar picture, let me add, has been painted by the poet Spenser,\r\nthough he refers, of course, to the British Eagle:--\r\n\r\n    \"Like to an eagle, in his kingly pride,\r\n     Soaring through his wide empire of the air\r\n     To weather his broad sails, by chance has spied\r\n     A goshawk, which hath seizèd for her share\r\n     Upon some fowl that should her feast prepare.\r\n     With dreadful force he flies at her again,\r\n     That with his voice which none endure or dare\r\n     Her from the quarry he away doth drive,\r\n     And from her griping pounce the greedy prey doth rive.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Reptilia_ are represented in America by a very great number of\r\nspecies, many being remarkable for their great size or the terrible\r\nvenom with which they are provided. The crocodiles of the American\r\ncontinent form a distinct genus, sometimes designated _Alligator_, and\r\nsometimes _Caiman_. The Alligators, or Caimans (_Alligator lucius_), are\r\nSaurians of huge bulk; with a long flat head, thick neck and body, a\r\ncavernous mouth suggestive of infinite voracity, dull cruel eyes, and a\r\nlong taper tail, which, strongly compressed on the sides, is surmounted\r\nwith a double series of strong plates, that unite about the middle, and\r\nform a single row to the extremity. It is this tail that gives them most\r\nof their progressive power in the water, and though it obstructs their\r\nmovements on land, it is useful even then as a powerful weapon of\r\ndefence. Transverse rows of square bony plates, rising in the centre\r\ninto keel-shaped ridges, protect the body, and render the hideous animal\r\nexceedingly formidable as an antagonist. It frequently attains the\r\nlength of eighteen, and is seldom less than fifteen feet. Its teeth are\r\nnumerous, sharp, and strong; its claws long and tenacious. It feeds\r\ngenerally on fish, turtle, fowl, or whatever other prey may fall within\r\nits reach; and woe to the unfortunate animal that comes to the\r\nriver-bank in quest of water within the range of this ferocious saurian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALLIGATORS, OR CAIMANS.]\r\n\r\nThe caiman never attacks man if his intended victim is on his guard, but\r\nhe is cunning enough to know when this may be done with impunity. Mr.\r\nBates records an affecting instance. The river Amazons at Caiçara had\r\nsunk one season to a very low point, so that the port and bathing-place\r\nof the village now lay at the foot of a long sloping bank, and a large\r\ncaiman made his appearance in the shallow and muddy water. \"We were all\r\nobliged,\" says our traveller,[141] \"to be very careful in taking our\r\nbath; most of the people simply using a calabash, pouring the water over\r\nthemselves while standing on the brink. A large trading canoe, belonging\r\nto a Barra merchant, arrived at this time, and the Indian crew, as\r\nusual, spent the first day or two after their coming into port in\r\ndrunkenness and debauchery ashore. One of the men, during the greatest\r\nheat of the day, when almost every one was enjoying his afternoon's nap,\r\ntook it into his head whilst in a tipsy state to go down and bathe. He\r\nwas seen only by the Suiz de Paz (Justice of Peace), a feeble old man\r\nwho was lying in his hammock, in the open verandah at the rear of his\r\nhouse on the top of the bank, and who shouted to the besotted Indian to\r\nbeware of the alligator. Before he could repeat his warning the man\r\nstumbled, and a pair of gaping jaws, appearing suddenly above the\r\nsurface, seized him round the waist and drew him under the water. A cry\r\nof agony was the last sign made by the wretched victim. The village was\r\naroused; the young men, with praiseworthy readiness, seized their\r\nharpoons and hurried down to the bank; but of course it was too late, a\r\nwinding track of blood on the surface of the water was all that could be\r\nseen. They embarked, however, in light boats, determined on vengeance;\r\nthe monster was traced, and when, after a short lapse of time, he came\r\nup to breathe, one leg sticking out from his jaws, was dispatched with\r\nbitter curses.\"\r\n\r\nIn the temperate regions of North America, where crocodiles still exist,\r\nthese animals pass the entire winter in lethargic torpor. In the Pampas\r\nof tropical America, on the contrary, it is during the hot season that\r\nthey remain inert in the mud of the dried-up marshes. \"According to the\r\nstatements of the natives,\" says Humboldt, \"you may sometimes see, on\r\nthe return of the rainy season, the humid clay slowly uplifted and\r\nloosened in great clods. A violent detonation soon makes itself heard,\r\nand the earth is flung up into the air to a great height, as in\r\neruptions of small mud volcanoes. If you understand the cause of this\r\nphenomenon you will quickly take to flight, for from this retreat\r\nimmediately emerges a monstrous water-serpent or a plated crocodile,\r\nwhich the first shower has awakened from his lethargy.\" The great\r\nwater-serpent here spoken of is, in all probability, the gigantic\r\nBoa-Constrictor, one of the most dangerous denizens of the marshy plains\r\nof equatorial America. Travellers of unimpeachable authority assert that\r\nthis frightful reptile often attains the length of thirty-six to\r\nforty-five feet. Day and night he lurks among the tall rank herbage; in\r\nthe morning and the evening he places himself in ambush on the border of\r\nsome lake or water-course to surprise the quadrupeds which flock thither\r\nto quench their thirst. By means of his prehensile tail he suspends\r\nhimself to a tree on the shore, and patiently awaits the coming prey.\r\nWhen an animal passes within his reach, he swiftly seizes it, enfolds it\r\nin his spiral coils, crushes it against the tree which serves for his\r\n_point d'appui_, compresses its bleeding mass into a convenient form,\r\ncovers it with a glutinous saliva, and swallows it. In this fashion the\r\nboa will devour a stag or even an ox entire, nor does he fear to attack\r\nthe puma and the jaguar. Whether he is dangerous to man may reasonably\r\nbe doubted; his immense size, at all events, renders it easy to avoid\r\nhim. He preys upon fish in default of other provision, and to catch his\r\nvictims often remains for a considerable time with his head and a\r\nportion of his body plunged under water.\r\n\r\nThe true scourges of tropical America and the Antilles are the\r\n_Rattlesnake_ and the lance-headed _Viper_.\r\n\r\nThe Rattlesnake (_Crotalus horridus_) is one of the deadliest of\r\nvenomous serpents, is frequently six feet in length, and as thick as a\r\nman's leg. But Providence has furnished it with an antidote against its\r\nown poison, or, at least, with an instrument which makes it its own\r\nbetrayer, and warns man involuntarily against its formidable presence.\r\nThis is the _rattle_ to which it owes its vulgar appellation. The rattle\r\nis situated at the end of the tail, and consists of several hard, dry,\r\nbony processes. Imagine a string of hollow, dry, semi-transparent bones,\r\nnearly of the same size and figure, and resembling to some extent the\r\nshape of the human _os sacrum_: imagine these so placed that the tip of\r\nevery uppermost bone runs within two of the bones below it; imagine\r\nthese constantly clattering against each other, as the reptile moves,\r\nwith a hoarse, dull, echoing sound, and you will be able to form some\r\nidea of the permanent warning of its approach which the Crotalus carries\r\nabout with it. The rattle is placed with the broad part perpendicular to\r\nthe body, and not horizontal; and the first joint is attached to the\r\nlast vertebra of the tail by means of a thick muscle beneath it, no less\r\nthan by the membranes which unite it to the skin. The bony rings\r\nincrease in number with the reptile's age, and it gains an additional\r\none, it is said, at each casting of the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROTALUS, AND BOA-CONSTRICTOR.]\r\n\r\nThe _Crotalus horridus_ is of a yellowish-brown colour, varied with\r\npatches of a deeper hue, and from the head to some distance down the\r\nneck run two or three longitudinal stripes of the same. Its habits are\r\nsluggish; it moves slowly, and only bites when angered, or for the\r\npurpose of killing its prey. It is provided with two kinds of\r\nteeth--viz., the smaller, which, planted in each jaw, serve to catch and\r\nretain the food; and secondly, the fangs or poisonous teeth, which kill\r\nthe prey, and are placed outside the upper jaw. It feeds principally\r\nupon the smaller mammals and upon birds, which it seems certain it\r\npossesses a peculiar power of fascinating--the effect, it may be, of\r\nintense fear. \"When the piercing eye of the rattlesnake is fixed on\r\nthem,\" says Mr. Murray, \"terror and amazement render them incapable of\r\nescaping; and, while involuntarily keeping their eyes fixed on those of\r\nthe reptile, birds have been seen to drop into its mouth, as if\r\nparalyzed, squirrels descend from their trees, and leverets run into the\r\njaws of the expecting devourer.\" Hogs and peccaries, however, are\r\nunaffected by this panic, and feed greedily upon the reptile which\r\ncauses it, whose venomous fangs cannot penetrate their formidable hide.\r\nIts poison, once imbibed, is very fatal, acting upon man and the larger\r\nmammals, such as the horse or ass, in a few hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRIGONOCEPHALUS PURSUED BY BIRDS.]\r\n\r\nThe lance-headed Viper or Trigonocephalus (_Bothrops lanceolatus_), is\r\nmost common in the West Indian Islands, where it is justly dreaded. It\r\nhas been computed that, at Martinique, fifty persons out of a population\r\nof 125,000 souls die annually from the bite of these odious reptiles.\r\nTheir fecundity is frightful. Every female bears sixty young, which on\r\ntheir very advent into the world are completely formed and able to\r\nwound. This viper, moreover, carries no warning rattle; nothing\r\nindicates its presence; and in the countries which it inhabits, the\r\nwayfarer, if prudent, will beat the herbs and bushes as he advances with\r\na switch. Then the Trigonocephalus, if there be one in the way, will\r\ntake flight and reveal itself, for it is too large to glide away unseen.\r\nTherefore, the negroes of Martinique, who, of necessity, are assiduous\r\nreptile hunters, state as an incontrovertible axiom, confirmed by\r\nimmemorial experience, that \"a serpent seen is a serpent dead.\" In\r\ntruth, the serpent is only formidable to man when not perceived, and\r\nwhen one treads upon it accidentally. In the open field its defeat and\r\ndeath are inevitable, however little coolness or skill its assailant may\r\npossess. And to warn us of the presence of the Trigonocephalus, Nature\r\nhas supplied us with numerous watchful sentinels in the small birds,\r\nwhose not unreasonable hate against this serpent is a remarkable proof\r\nof their intelligence. If ever your destiny conduct you to the Antilles,\r\nsays a naturalist, cold-blooded sportsman as you may be, do not slay the\r\nlittle bird which the grateful negroes, though he sings but little, have\r\nwished to name the nightingale; for if you do so, they will regard you\r\nwith suspicion and dislike. He is their protector, and he watches also\r\nover you. No sooner does he see, from his aërial station, the scales of\r\nthe reptile gliding into the herbage or glittering among the large\r\nleaves, than he can no longer control himself. He flies to and fro, he\r\nleaps from branch to branch, summoning with a lamentable cry all the\r\nfeathered tribe from the neighbouring trees. From far and near the cry\r\nwidens and is repeated; from all directions flock nightingales, and\r\nthrushes, grosbeaks, and humming-birds, and hovering above the assassin,\r\nfuriously denounce it, and indicate its lurking-place to man. Irritated\r\nby such a concert of maledictions, the serpent elevates its crest, but,\r\nlo! they are far beyond its reach! And the cries, the murmurs, the\r\ninsults are redoubled! It seeks to conceal itself, but these cries\r\npersistently accompany it. Wherever it drags its slimy shining bulk,\r\nthey follow, they harass, and they denounce it. Either night comes on,\r\nor it succeeds in completely hiding itself from their watchful gaze,\r\nbefore they reluctantly leave it to its own devices. Great the\r\nconsternation if their enemy escape them! But what joy, what triumphal\r\nsounds, if man appears upon the scene and slays it!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have previously alluded to the enormous toads found in South America,\r\nand to the gigantic frog which belongs to the northern continent. Among\r\nthe former I may particularize as one of the largest known species, the\r\n_Agua_; and, as remarkable for its mode of gestation, the _Pipa_. The\r\nSurinam Toad, or _Pipa Surinamensis_ (the _Bufo Pipa_ of Linné), is\r\ndistinguished by its large triangular head, and horizontally flattened\r\nbody, with a granulated back. It is now ascertained that the female\r\ndeposits her spawn at the brink of some shallow or stagnant pool; the\r\nmale then collects the heap and cautiously places it on the back of the\r\nfemale, where, after impregnation, they are pressed into cellules\r\nproduced by the tumefaction of the skin. In rather less than three\r\nmonths the eggs are hatched, and the young emerge in a complete state.\r\n\r\nThe Bull-Frog (_Rana pipilus_), of North America, is from six to eight\r\ninches long and from three to four inches broad. When his limbs are\r\nfully extended he measures about eighteen inches in length. Its back is\r\nof a sombre green colour, varied with black; the under-parts being of a\r\nwhitish hue, tinged with green, and thickly spotted. The fore-feet have\r\nonly four toes, and are unwebbed; the hind-feet are large, long, and\r\nwidely webbed. Its voice may be compared to the distant lowing of a\r\nbull, and a chorus of them at night is sufficient to arouse the soundest\r\nsleeper. They prey upon ducklings, goslings, and small birds, drowning\r\nbefore devouring them. Spite of its size and ungainliness, it is very\r\nnimble, and can accomplish a leap of upwards of six feet in height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Bufo Agua. 2. Pipa Surinamensis.]\r\n\r\nIncomplete as is this rapid survey of the Fauna of the New World\r\nDeserts, I cannot terminate it without referring to the strange and\r\nformidable fish which haunt the pools, lakes, and marshes of South\r\nAmerica--those _Gymnoti_, or Electrical Eels, sometimes five, six, and\r\neven eight feet long, which emit electrical discharges of sufficient\r\nviolence to strike down a man, a horse, or an ox. It is by this singular\r\nproperty the gymnotus supports its existence; its shocks stupify the\r\nsmaller fishes and other animals that come within its range, so that\r\nthey fall an easy prey to its voracity. The electrical organs consist of\r\nfour bundles of parallel membranaceous laminæ arranged along the inner\r\nside of the tail, and constituting a remarkably powerful battery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISHING FOR GYMNOTI.]\r\n\r\nIn hunting the gymnoti the Indians adopt a cruel expedient. They drive a\r\nherd of horses and mules into the ponds which these eels inhabit, and\r\nharpoon them when they have spent their electrical force on the unhappy\r\nquadrupeds. The fish swim on the surface of the water like serpents, and\r\nskilfully glide beneath the animal's body, discharging the whole length\r\nof their electrical battery, and attacking simultaneously the digestive\r\nviscera, and, above all, the gastric plexus of nerves. Fain would the\r\nhorses escape their enemies' attacks, but the Indians drive them back\r\ninto the water with stout canes of bamboo and long whips. After awhile\r\nthe eels grow exhausted; the animals show less alarm; and the Indians\r\nbegin to ply their harpoons with equal agility and success. There are\r\nseveral species of this remarkable fish, and most, if not all, are\r\nvalued as wholesome food. The Gymnotus Electricus, however, is the only\r\none which possesses any electrical powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE AUSTRALIAN PRAIRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first naturalists who explored the littoral of the Australian\r\ncontinent and its adjacent islands were struck with astonishment at the\r\nsight of the strange and almost monstrous animals they discovered there.\r\nFar more certainly than Columbus had they fallen in with a New World; a\r\nnew world of zoology and botany; a world apart, peopled by beings wholly\r\ndifferent from those they had elsewhere studied, and some of which\r\nexhibited a complexity and originality of organization and structure\r\nwholly antagonistic to the received theories of fundamental\r\ncharacteristics belonging to the various classes of the animal kingdom.\r\nThe Australian Fauna, in this respect, can only be compared to that of\r\nMadagascar, which equally bears an impress peculiarly its own, and\r\npresents but a few features of kinship with the Indian Fauna. It is the\r\nlatter also that the Australian Fauna most closely approaches, or, to\r\nspeak more correctly, from which it least widely diverges.\r\n\r\nThe great Herbivora--Pachyderms, Ruminants, and Solidungulates--are\r\nabsolutely wanting in Australia, as well as the Carnivora properly so\r\ncalled--Apes and Lemuridæ. The class of Mammals is only represented by\r\na small number of Cheiroptera and Rodents; by some Amphibia, Phocæ, and\r\nOtidæ (Seals and Bustards), which inhabit the bays carved out of its\r\nlong line of coast; by the Marsupials and a very limited order of\r\nMonotremata. The two latter groups are pre-eminently characteristic of\r\nthe Australian Fauna; the second belongs exclusively to it. Little,\r\nindeed, is wanting to make it identical with the sub-class of the\r\nMarsupials, represented only in South America by the genera Opossum\r\ndidelphis, Hemiurus, and Chironectes, and elsewhere limited to New\r\nHolland, Tasmania, New Guinea, New Zealand, and some other less\r\nimportant islands of Oceania.\r\n\r\nThe Marsupials (from the Greek [Greek: marsypos], a purse) owe their\r\ndistinctive name to a very curious peculiarity in the organization of\r\nthe females. The latter bring their young into the world while still\r\nvery feeble, and of themselves fix them to their breasts, where they\r\nremain attached until they have acquired that degree of development\r\nwhich all other mammals possess at their birth. Generally the breasts\r\nare covered with a loose skin, forming a sort of pouch or purse, in\r\nwhich the young are concealed, which protects them against climatic\r\nchanges, and enables the mother conveniently to carry them everywhere\r\nabout with her. Two particular bones, called the marsupial bones,\r\nattached to the pubis, and placed amidst the abdominal muscles, support\r\nthis pouch. They assist, says Professor Owen, in producing a compression\r\nof the mammary gland, necessary for the alimentation of a peculiarly\r\nfeeble offspring, and they defend the abdominal viscera from the\r\npressure of the young as they increase in size, during their mammary or\r\nmarsupial existence, and still more when they return to the pouch for\r\ntemporary shelter.\r\n\r\nThe marsupials present, moreover, in the different families composing\r\nthe order, a great diversity of organization. Most of them are\r\nherbivorous or frugivorous; but there are some which prefer animal\r\nnourishment, and which, in their habits as well as in the structure of\r\ntheir jaws and their digestive apparatus, closely approach the\r\ncarnivora.\r\n\r\nThe order of which I am speaking includes some animals of great size.\r\nSuch is the Great Kangaroo (_Macropus giganteus_), which generally\r\nmeasures about seven and a half feet in length from the nose to the tip\r\nof the tail, the tail being rather more than three feet in length, and\r\nfully twelve inches in circumference at the base. In its erect sitting\r\nposture, when it rests on its hind-legs and the root of its tail as on a\r\ntripod, its height amounts to about fifty inches; but when it rises on\r\nits toes to look around, its stature exceeds that of a man. The great\r\nlength of its hind-legs is a notable peculiarity; their feet are\r\nprovided with only four toes, the central being very long, of great\r\nstrength, and terminated in a large and powerful hoof-like nail or claw.\r\nThe fore-legs, on the contrary, are very short, and the feet divided\r\ninto five toes, each furnished with a short and somewhat hooked claw.\r\nThe animal's head is small, with rather pointed ears, and large but\r\nplacid eyes; it has a thin and gracefully proportioned neck; so that a\r\nstartling discrepancy is observable between the fore and the posterior\r\nparts of the animal, though the general effect is neither ungraceful nor\r\nunpleasing. It should be noticed that the kangaroo never folds his tail\r\nbetween his legs, which, I may add, are extraordinarily strong. The\r\nthighs are thick, the tarsi long and robust. He only walks on all fours\r\nwhen hotly pressed, and then his appearance is decidedly ungainly. In\r\nescaping from an enemy he rears himself upright, skims the plain with\r\nbounding leaps, and in a few minutes leaves behind him the swiftest\r\nhorse or dog. But if all avenues of retreat be closed to him, he plants\r\nhimself firmly against a tree or a rock and fights with obstinate\r\ncourage, ripping up his assailants with his potent hind-feet, like a\r\nstag with his horns or a wild boar with his tusks.\r\n\r\nThe diet of the kangaroo is essentially \"vegetarian;\" he lives upon\r\nleaves, herbs, and roots, and employs his fore-paws, like the Rodents,\r\nto carry his food to his mouth. The animal's habits are mild and\r\ninoffensive. They roamed very peacefully about the Australian prairies\r\nbefore the new continent was opened up to European enterprise; having no\r\nother enemies to fear than the natives, who were scattered in small\r\ntribes over a few points of an immense territory. Their chase is now\r\none of the favourite amusements of the colonists, who destroy them in\r\ngreat numbers. They are easily domesticated, and may be regarded as\r\nalready acclimatized in Europe, where, it is hoped, they may prove of\r\ngreat utility. The flesh of the tame Kangaroo is very good, but that of\r\nthe wild animal is still better. Their skin, covered with a thick hair\r\nof an uniformly gray colour, may be adapted to various purposes.\r\n\r\nThe genus comprehends several species of very different dimensions: as,\r\nthe Great Kangaroo, already mentioned; the Woolly or Red Kangaroo (_M.\r\nlaniger_), which rather exceeds it in size; and the Potoroo, which is\r\nlarger than a rat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGE-BROWED WOMBAT (_Phascolomys latifrons_).]\r\n\r\nI must cite, besides the Kangaroos, as the most remarkable types of the\r\nAustralian Marsupials, the Phascolomys, the Phascolarctos, the\r\nPhalangas, and the Thylacynas.\r\n\r\nThe Phascolomys, like the kangaroo, has been introduced into Europe,\r\nwhere he seems to be perfectly acclimatized, and specimens may be seen\r\nboth in the London Zoological Gardens and the Jardin Zoologique of\r\nParis. He is better known by his native name of the Wombat (_Phascolomys\r\nWombat_), and was first discovered by Bass, the gallant explorer and\r\nsurgeon, whose name is indissolubly connected with the bright deeds of\r\nAustralian discovery. The large-browed wombat might, at first sight, be\r\nmistaken for a small bear. His loins are thick, his limbs short, his\r\nhair coarse--thickly set on the loins, back, and head, thinly scattered\r\nabout the belly--and of a light, shining sandy-brown. It is difficult to\r\nsay why he is surnamed _latifrons_, for his forehead is no larger than\r\nthat of other animals of his family; and, at all events, he exhibits, by\r\nway of compensation, an extraordinary extent of surface in the hinder\r\nparts, which, as they are utterly deficient in tail, present a very\r\ngrotesque appearance. He burrows like the badger, and on the Australian\r\ncontinent never quits his retreat until night sets in. He lives on herbs\r\nand roots. The natives roast his flesh, and esteem it a viand of no\r\nordinary excellence.\r\n\r\nThe Phascolarctos, or Koala (_Phascolarctos cinereus_), is closely\r\nallied to the wombat. He is strongly but clumsily made, with robust\r\nlimbs and powerful claws, which he employs in clinging to the branches\r\nof the trees where he chiefly makes his home. However, he frequently\r\nvisits _terra firma_, and burrows with great ease; concealing himself in\r\na torpid state in his subterranean retreat during the cold season. His\r\nfore-feet have each five toes, of which two are opposed to the other\r\nthree--a circumstance noted in no other mammal. He has no tail, like the\r\nwombat. His coat is a bluish-gray fur, very thick and extremely soft,\r\ndarkest on the back, and very pale under the throat and belly. An\r\nelongated nose looks as if it were tipped with black leather. The eyes\r\nare round and dark; the ears almost hidden in the plenitude of fur. By\r\nday he is a drowsy and, sooth to say, a stupid animal; but at night he\r\nwakes up into a more active state. He feeds upon the fresh young tops of\r\ntrees, selecting their blossoms and young shoots; and though in\r\nappearance resembling the Phalanga, in habits seems closely allied to\r\nthe Sloth.\r\n\r\nThe _Phalangas_ form the typical genus of the tribe of Phalangistins,\r\nwhich comprehends, in addition, the genera _Trichosura_, _Pseudochira_,\r\nand _Dromicia_. Several species are met with in Malaysia, but they\r\nchiefly belong to the Australian Fauna. They live chiefly in trees,\r\nfeeding on various kinds of small animals, insects, eggs, and fruits,\r\nwhich they grasp between their fore-paws, and so bring to their mouth.\r\nTheir appearance may be imagined by putting together a rather short head\r\nwith short ears and short woolly fur; a squirrel-like body and long\r\nprehensile tail, sometimes completely covered with hair: the body\r\nmeasures about twenty-six inches, and the tail about fifteen inches. The\r\ntwo principal species are the Sooty Phalanga (_Phalangista fuliginosa_),\r\nfound in Van Diemen's Land, and named in reference to its smoky black\r\nfur; and the Vulpine Phalanga, or Vulpine Opossum (_P. vulpina_), widely\r\ndistributed over Australia, and having a fox-like character about his\r\nhead. The Flying Phalangas are also allied to this genus.\r\n\r\nThe _Thylacyni_ are distinguished from the Opossums by the hind-feet\r\nhaving no thumb, by a hairy and non-prehensile tail, and by having two\r\nincisors less to each jaw. Only one species is known to exist in\r\nAustralia,[142] where it is called the \"Tasmanian Wolf,\" and sometimes\r\n\"Tiger\" and \"Hyæna.\" It resembles a wolf in many respects, but its\r\nhinder parts are sensibly higher than its fore; its elongated muzzle is\r\nalmost cylindrical in shape, and very thick; and his tail, broad at the\r\nbase, tapers away to a fine point. The colour is gray, striped with\r\nblack across the hinder limbs.\r\n\r\nOf the _Thylacynus cynocephalus_ M. Paul Gervais furnishes the following\r\ndescription:[143]--\r\n\r\n\"There exists in Tasmania an animal of carnivorous habits almost as\r\nlarge as a wolf, and whose external forms at the first glance do not\r\ndiffer sufficiently from those of the latter to prevent one from\r\nincluding him in the family _Canidæ_; but this member of the Carnivora,\r\nthough he has also the wolf's appetite, and commits havoc in the same\r\nmanner among the flocks of the colonists, belongs, like most of the\r\nAustralian Mammals, to the sub-class of Marsupials. There is also much\r\nanalogy, in many of its osteological characteristics, with the extinct\r\ngenera of the Hyenodons and Ptérodons; but the latter are in reality\r\nMonodelphia, and should be ranged among the Carnivora properly so\r\ncalled. The English settlers in Van Diemen's Land give the thylacynus\r\nthe name of _Zebra Wolf_, because it has, in effect, the greater portion\r\nof the dorsal region and the base of the tail marked with transversal\r\nbrown lines, like zebra stripes. This carnivorous animal is also their\r\n_Dog-headed Opossum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THYLACYNUS CYNOCEPHALUS.]\r\n\r\n\"Allied to other Marsupials by the totality of its anatomical\r\ncharacteristics, it is nevertheless easy to distinguish generically; in\r\nthe first place, it is of great size, and its exterior recalls that of\r\nthe Wolf, though it has a longer head and a tail garnished with very\r\nshort hair; the latter is, at the same time, a little depressed.\r\nMoreover, it numbers forty-six teeth, with wide intervals between each.\r\nIt is digitigrade: it has five toes on the fore, and four toes on its\r\nhinder feet; its marsupial bones are simply rudimental.\"\r\n\r\nIf there be one group of animals more than another whose unforeseen\r\ndiscovery has succeeded in astonishing and embarrassing zoologists, it\r\nis assuredly that which has been designated by the name of\r\n_Monotremata_. It is the lowest order of vertebrated animals, the very\r\nbottom of the scale, approximating in many characteristic points to the\r\nfamily of Birds. The pelvis, it is true, is furnished with marsupial\r\nbones, but these animals possess no pouch. The skull is smooth, the\r\nbrain-case proportionately very small, the snout much prolonged, while\r\nthe jaws have neither teeth nor soft movable lips. The shoulder-bones do\r\nnot resemble those of a mammal, but in some respects the scapular joint\r\nof the bird; in other respects, that of the reptiles. The feet have five\r\ntoes, each armed with a long nail; and, in addition, the hind-feet are\r\nprovided with a perforated spur-like weapon, which is connected with a\r\ngland. The genus derives its distinctive name from the circumstance that\r\nthe orifices of the urinary canals, the intestinal and the generative\r\ncanals, open, as in birds, into a common vent. The mammary glands, of\r\nwhich only one exists on each side, are not furnished with nipples, but\r\nopen by simple slits on each side of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThis order includes two families: the _Ornithorhynchidæ_ and the\r\n_Echidnidæ_, both belonging to Australia and Tasmania. The former are\r\naquatic in their habits, the latter terrestrial.\r\n\r\nThe Echidna (_Echidna Hystrix_), or Porcupine Ant-Eater, resembles the\r\nPorcupine in his general appearance and coat of spines, the Ant-Eater in\r\nhis snout, mouth, and long lubricated tongue. His legs are very short\r\nand thick, and each is furnished with five broad rounded toes; the four\r\ntoes are armed with a long blunt claw, but on the hind-feet one toe is\r\nwithout a claw, two are short and blunt, and one is of great length,\r\nrather curved, and sharp pointed. He measures about twelve inches, and\r\nall over the upper-parts of the body and tail is thickly beset with\r\nformidable spines, very sharp and strong; over the head, legs, and\r\nunder-parts with bristly hair of a deep brown colour. His short tail is\r\ncovered with perpendicular spines. Digging up the ground with his keen\r\nclaws he disburies a host of insects, which he rolls over his long red\r\ncylindrical tongue. He is very timid, and when any one approaches him,\r\ncoils himself up in a ball, like a hedgehog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Ornithorhynchus. 2. Echidna.]\r\n\r\nThe _Ornithorhynchus_ (\"Bird-beaked\"), or _Duck-Billed Platypus_, is\r\nanother extraordinary animal, which seems to serve as the connecting\r\nlink between the aquatic birds and the mammalia. His length is about\r\ntwenty inches; his body, long and flattened like an otter's, is covered\r\nwith a thick soft fur, moderately dark brown above and whitish beneath;\r\nhis tail is flat and obtuse; his feet are furnished with a membrane that\r\nunites the toes; and he has an elongated, enlarged, and flattened muzzle\r\nlike a duck's beak. It is evident, therefore, that he can live only on\r\nsoft food, and that his habits must be aquatic; and hence we find him\r\nburrowing in the banks of the streams, and groping for his food, like a\r\nduck, among the mud and water. The settlers term him characteristically\r\n\"the River-Mole.\"\r\n\r\nA word of allusion must now be permitted to the _Petrogale_, a genus of\r\nthe Kangaroo family, described by Dr. Gray. The Brush-tailed Rock\r\nWallaby (_P. penicillata_) has a rough long fur, of a dusky brown hue,\r\ntinged with red and gray; a white streak passes down the middle of the\r\nthroat; his tail is very black, like a raven's plumage, long, and\r\nfurnished with thick hairs forming a brush. The male is about three feet\r\nand a half long. Another species is called the Short-Eared Rock Kangaroo\r\n(_P. brachiotis_). Both are excessively wild and shy in their habits,\r\nfrequenting in the day-time the most inaccessible rocks and the loftiest\r\nmountain-peaks, and descending, at the approach of twilight, to feed in\r\nthe retired and grassy valleys. They flock together in such numbers as\r\nto form well-beaten paths along the mountain-sides, and leap from crag\r\nto crag with all the agility of the chamois.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Ornithological Fauna of Australia and the islands of Oceania is\r\nincomparably richer than the Mammalogical Fauna, and includes several\r\nspecies of the most dazzling plumage; but nearly all these species\r\ninhabit the forests which cover a part of the littoral and probably of\r\nthe interior. However we must signalize, as peculiar to the Prairies, a\r\ngreat number of the _Brevipennes_ (_i.e._, Short-wings), the Emu or Emeu\r\n(_Dromaius Novæ Hollandiæ_); two Palmipeds, the Black Swan and the\r\nCereopsis; and, finally, a bird, the only one of its order, almost as\r\nmuch of a paradox among bipeds as is the ornithorhynchus among\r\nquadrupeds, the Apteryx.\r\n\r\nThe Emu is allied to the cassowary; he is nearly equal to the ostrich in\r\nbulk, but has a thicker body, shorter legs, and a shorter neck. He\r\nmeasures more than seven feet in length; his plumage exhibits a mixture\r\nof brown and gray; his beak is black, his head covered with feathers; he\r\nhas real wings, though they are of so small a size as to be useless for\r\nflight; they are covered with feathers like the rest of the body, from\r\nwhich, when the bird is not in motion, they can hardly be discerned.\r\nInternally, the emu differs, it is said, from all other species,\r\nparticularly in having no gizzard, and in the extremely small size of\r\nhis liver.\r\n\r\nEmus are killed, according to Captain (now Sir George) Grey, in\r\nprecisely the same manner as kangaroos, but as they are more prized by\r\nthe natives, a greater degree of excitement prevails when an emu is\r\nslain; shout succeeds shout, and the distant natives take up the cry\r\nuntil it is sometimes re-echoed for miles. The feast which follows the\r\ndeath, however, is a very exclusive one, for the flesh is much too\r\ndelicious to be made a common article of food. Heavy penalties are\r\naccordingly pronounced against young men, and unauthorized persons, who\r\nventure to touch it; and these, invariably, are rigidly enforced.[144]\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy knows the famous quotation in his Latin grammar which\r\ntells of a\r\n\r\n    \"Rara avis, simillimaque nigro cygno.\"\r\n\r\nA _Black Swan_ is no longer a \"rara avis.\" The species (_Cygnus\r\natratus_) belongs to New Holland and Tasmania, and is of the same size\r\nas the common swan. His plumage is wholly black, with the exception of\r\nthe primary pens, which are white; his beak is red, and so is the\r\nfeatherless skin surrounding it at the base. He has been successfully\r\nacclimatized in Europe, and ornaments the lakes and streams of many\r\nEnglish parks.\r\n\r\nThe Cereopsis, or Cerefaced Goose, of New Holland, is a Palmiped genus,\r\nabout the size of a common goose, which, in general appearance, he\r\nresembles, except that his legs are longer, averaging from two and a\r\nhalf to three feet. The plumage is of a dingy gray. A large patch of\r\ndull white occupies the top of the head; the quill-feathers, both of the\r\nwings and tail, are of a dusty black. His voice has a hoarse deep clang,\r\nlike that of a storm-bell. He usually weighs from seven to ten pounds,\r\nand makes an excellent dish for an Australian Christmas table.\r\nSpecimens may be seen both in the Zoological Gardens of London and\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APTERYX AUSTRALIS.]\r\n\r\nThe _Apteryx Australis_, or Wingless Emu--the _Kiwi_ of the New\r\nZealanders--somewhat resembles a penguin in form, and stands about two\r\nfeet in height. The only living specimen in Europe lives, I believe, in\r\nthe London Zoological Gardens. As it does not appear to rank, in\r\nscientific classification, with any other family or genus, naturalists\r\nhave erected it into a distinct order--the _Nullipennes_, or Wingless.\r\nThe wings of the apteryx are literally rudiments; a mere stump,\r\nterminated by a hook. None of his bones are hollow; he has no abdominal\r\nair-cells; his feathers have no accessory plume; his feet have a short\r\nand elevated hind-toe; his eyes are small; he feeds on insects; and his\r\nhabits are nocturnal. He is a bird of great physical power, and runs\r\nwith ostrich-like swiftness; taking refuge, when pursued, in burrows,\r\nhollow trees, and the clefts of the rocks. His cry resembles a loud\r\nwhistle, and the natives entrap the bird by imitating it. When the\r\nfemale has been taken, the male is easily caught, owing to his\r\nreluctance to leave her. He will, however, defend himself vigorously\r\nwith his spurs.\r\n\r\nThe Erpetological Fauna of Australia, and, in general, of Oceania, is\r\nvery poor, and comprehends no great species. I may notice a genus of\r\nlizards, the Chlamydosaurus, discovered by Allan Cunningham, the\r\nnaturalist attached to Captain King's expedition, about 1820. It\r\nmeasures about seventeen inches in length, of which twelve inches are\r\napportioned to the tail; is of a yellowish-brown colour; has a large\r\nhead, with prominent eyes; and a membraneous ruff or tippet round its\r\nneck, covering its shoulders, and when expanded spreading about five\r\ninches in the form of an open umbrella. If attacked or terrified, it\r\nelevates the frill or ruff and makes for a tree; where, if overtaken, it\r\nthrows itself upon a stem, raising its head and chest as high as it can\r\nupon the fore-legs, then doubling its tail underneath the body, and\r\ndisplaying a very formidable set of teeth from the concavity of its\r\nlarge frill, it boldly faces any opponent, biting fiercely whatever is\r\npresented to it, and even venturing so far in its rage as to fairly make\r\na fierce charge at its enemy.\r\n\r\nVenomous serpents are numerous: particularly the _Hydrophis_, or\r\nWater-Snake, very common in the neighbouring seas, where it feeds on\r\nfishes. The back part of the body and tail being much compressed, and\r\nvertically raised, endows it with the capacity of swimming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n_THE FORESTS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE VIRGIN FORESTS.\r\n\r\n                      \"The noonday sun\r\n    Now shone upon the Forest, one vast mass\r\n    Of mingling shade....\r\n                      Like restless serpents, clothed\r\n    In rainbow and in fire, the parasites,\r\n    Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around\r\n    The gray trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes.\r\n    With gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles,\r\n    Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love,\r\n    These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs\r\n    Uniting their close union; the woven leaves\r\n    Make net-work of the dark blue light of day,\r\n    And the night's noontide clearness, mutable\r\n    As shapes in the weird clouds.\"\r\n                         SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all parts of the world some regions exist where, owing to a concourse\r\nof favourable circumstances, the productive forces of Nature have been\r\nable to manifest themselves with an exceptional energy--where vegetable\r\nlife, in particular, has acquired an extraordinary development. The rich\r\nsoil is covered, over more or less extensive areas, with vivacious\r\nplants, robust and of great stature, which closely rooted, one against\r\nanother, with intertwining and overarching boughs, sustaining by their\r\nbulk and shading with their foliage other and weaker plants, have formed\r\nin the course of innumerable ages those masses of umbrageous gloom\r\ncalled Forests.\r\n\r\nThese, undoubtedly, are one of the grandest and most impressive\r\nmonuments of the Creative Power; one, I may add, of the most eloquent,\r\nfor there is nothing in all Nature whose study better repays the\r\nstudent, or which more largely abounds in important lessons.\r\n\r\nThe virgin forest, moreover, is one of the sanctuaries of Nature, where\r\nher mysteries are seldom profaned by man. There life reveals itself, and\r\nmoves at liberty, under an infinite variety of forms. It is the asylum\r\nof a multitude of animals of all classes, which find therein, united,\r\nthe two essential conditions of existence--shelter and nourishment.\r\nWithout the difficult approaches, the obscurity and the profound depth\r\nof the forests, says a naturalist, what would become of the species of\r\nmammals, birds, and reptiles, against which man wages incessant war?\r\nNature, then, seems to have provided these immense reservoirs to prevent\r\ntheir species from being totally annihilated. Independently of the trees\r\nwhich constitute the forests, a host of other plants make them their\r\nexclusive _habitat_; thence the specific and eminently characteristic\r\nnames--such as _Sylvestris_, _Sylvaticus_, _Nemorosus_--imposed upon a\r\ngreat number among them. Such plants are distinguished from their\r\ncongeners by the great dimensions of their stems; but, on the other\r\nhand, they do not possess the brilliantly-coloured flowers which adorn\r\nthe plants of the mountains and the plains always exposed to the action\r\nof the solar light.\r\n\r\nThe forests, moreover, offer for the botanist this remarkable and\r\nsingularly precious circumstance, that they form natural collections of\r\ntrees of the same species, or of several species of the same genus, or\r\nat least of the same family; so that their limits circumscribe the\r\n_habitat_ of these grand vegetables, and permit us to determine with\r\nease their geographical distribution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VIRGIN FOREST OF THE GABOON.]\r\n\r\nThe forests fill an important function in the general economy of the\r\nglobe, by the influence which they exercise upon the mean temperature\r\nand the other meteorological conditions of the regions they shelter. All\r\nother things being equal, the temperature of well-wooded countries is\r\nperceptibly less elevated and more uniform than that of dry and open\r\ndistricts. The amount of humidity which is retained on the surface of\r\nthe soil by wide-spread woods is considerable; it results from the\r\nlesser evaporation of the waters, the abundant transpiration of the\r\nleaves, and the heavy rains which inundate the forests during the\r\ntropical summer. Forests, like mountains, seem to attract the clouds. So\r\nthe plains which lie on their borders are ever better watered and\r\nfertile than those whose horizon no obstacle encumbers.\r\n\r\nThus, then, in the forests, in this bright and beautiful world of\r\nvegetation, most of the pleasures which man can derive from external\r\nnature are garnered up, and most of the lessons he requires are written.\r\nAll kinds of precious grace and teaching, says Mr. Ruskin,[145] are\r\nunited in this link between the Earth and the Stars: wonderful in\r\nuniversal adaptation to his need, desire, and discipline; God's daily\r\npreparation of the earth for him, with beautiful means of life. \"First,\r\na carpet to make it soft for him; then, a coloured fantasy of embroidery\r\nthereon; then, tall spreading of foliage to shade him from sun heat, and\r\nshade also the fallen rain, that it may not dry quickly back into the\r\nclouds, but stay to nourish the springs among the moss. Stout wood to\r\nbear this leafage: easily to be cut, yet tough and light, to make houses\r\nfor him, or instruments (lance-shaft, or plough handle, according to his\r\ntemper); useless it had been, if harder; useless, if less fibrous;\r\nuseless, if less elastic. Winter comes, and the shade of leafage falls\r\naway, to let the sun warm the earth; the strong boughs remain, breaking\r\nthe strength of winter winds. The seeds which are to prolong the race,\r\ninnumerable according to the need, are made beautiful and palatable,\r\nvaried into infinitude of appeal to the fancy of man, or provision for\r\nhis service: cold juice, or glowing spice, or balm, or incense,\r\nsoftening oil, preserving resin, medicine of styptic, febrifuge, or\r\nlulling charm--and all these presented in forms of endless change.\r\nFragility and force, softness and strength, in all degrees of aspects;\r\nunerring uprightness, as of temple pillars, or undivided wandering of\r\nfeeble tendrils on the ground; mighty resistances of rigid arm and limb\r\nto the storms of ages, or wavings to and fro with faintest pulse of\r\nsummer streamlet. Roots cleaving the strength of rock, or binding the\r\ntransience of the sand; crests basking in sunshine of the desert, or\r\nhiding by dripping spring and lightless cave; foliage for tossing in\r\nentangled fields beneath every wave of ocean--clothing with variegated,\r\neverlasting fibres, the peaks of the trackless mountains, or ministering\r\nat cottage doors to every gentlest passion and simplest joy of\r\nhumanity.\"\r\n\r\nConsidered in their physiological aspect, it is evident that the forests\r\nhave played, from the remotest ages of our planet, a pre-eminently\r\nuseful part, by absorbing the carbonic acid with which the atmosphere\r\nwas surcharged, fixing the carbon, and restoring to the air a quantity\r\nof oxygen sufficient for the support of animal life, impossible or\r\nrudimentary previous to their creation. And they still serve to maintain\r\nthe chemical equilibrium of the atmosphere, by incessantly refeeding it\r\nwith the oxygen which the respiration of animals and the phenomena of\r\ncombustion have transformed into carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nForests formerly abounded in Europe. In Gallia, Germania, Illyria,\r\nSarmatia, whole provinces were covered with immense woods of ancient and\r\npatriarchal trees. Civilization has destroyed them in great part, and\r\noften without discernment. At the present day few forests in Europe\r\nremain untouched. They are rare in Western Asia, in Central Asia, and in\r\nNorthern Asia; rarer still in the Chinese empire, where the population\r\nis denser than in any other country of the world, and where it is the\r\ngreat object of the policy of the State that not a rood of land shall be\r\nlost for the culture of plants valuable as food or for industrial\r\npurposes. It is only to the south of the Himalaya Mountains, in the\r\nstill savage and scantily peopled regions of India and Indo-China, that\r\none sees the great vegetables of the Tropical Zone agglomerated in\r\ncompact masses of considerable extent.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, forests of any size or density only exist in the mountainous\r\ncountries and towards the western littoral; as, notably, in the Soudan,\r\nthe Senegal, in Guinea, at the Gaboon, and on the coasts of Angola and\r\nBenguela. In North America, civilization has accomplished, in less than\r\nthree centuries, the work which in Europe occupied a much longer period.\r\nThe magnificent forests which spread their awful shades--their vast\r\nluxuriance of gloom--over the surface of this continent have fallen\r\nbefore the axe of the pioneer. Only at a few points is realized the fine\r\npicture of the poet; only in a few untrodden recesses still flourishes\r\nthe primeval forest, where--\r\n\r\n                        \"The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,\r\n    Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,\r\n    Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,\r\n    Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.\"[146]\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Palliser's expedition attempted to reach the head waters of\r\nthe North Thompson from the sources of the North Saskatchewan River, the\r\nleader encountered a forest-growth so dense, and so encumbered with\r\nfallen timber, that it proved an insurmountable obstacle. Viscount\r\nMilton and Mr. Cheadle, in their adventurous journey across the Rocky\r\nMountains to British Columbia, were involved in one of these\r\nwildernesses, and with difficulty effected a passage. \"No one,\" they\r\nremark,[147] \"who has not seen a primeval forest, where trees of\r\ngigantic size have grown and fallen undisturbed for ages, can form any\r\nidea of the collection of timber, or the impenetrable character of such\r\na region. There were pines and thujas of every size--the patriarch of\r\n300 feet in height standing alone, or thickly-clustering groups of young\r\nones struggling for the vacant place of some prostrate giant. The fallen\r\ntrees lay piled around, forming barriers often six or eight feet high on\r\nevery side: trunks of huge cedars, moss-grown and decayed, lay\r\nhalf-buried in the ground on which others as mighty had recently fallen;\r\ntrees still green and living, recently blown down, blocking the view\r\nwith the walls of earth held in their matted roots; living trunks, dead\r\ntrunks, rotten trunks; dry, barkless trunks, and trunks moist and green\r\nwith moss; bare trunks, and trunks with branches--prostrate, reclining,\r\nhorizontal, propped up at different angles; timber of every size, in\r\nevery stage of growth and decay, in every possible position, entangled\r\nin every possible combination. The swampy ground was densely covered\r\nwith American dog-wood, and elsewhere with thickets of the aralea, a\r\ntough-stemmed trailer, with leaves as large as those of the\r\nrhubarb-plant, and growing in many places as high as a man's shoulders.\r\nBoth stem and leaves are covered with sharp spines, which pierce your\r\nclothes as you force your way through the tangled growth, and make the\r\nlegs and hands of the pioneers scarlet from the inflammation of myriads\r\nof punctures.\"\r\n\r\nFar grander the scene, however--far richer in form and colour--which\r\nmeets our gaze in the stupendous forest growth still covering the basins\r\nof the Amazon and the Orinoco. As a companion to the foregoing picture,\r\nwe borrow one of this brighter and more wonderful region as painted with\r\nequal truth and vigour by Mr. Bates:--[148]\r\n\r\n\"The ground was thickly carpeted with Lycopodiums,[149] but it was also\r\nencumbered with masses of vegetable _débris_ and a thick coating of dead\r\nleaves. Fruits of many kinds were scattered about, amongst which were\r\nnumerous species of beans, some of the pods a foot long, flat and\r\nleathery in texture, others hard as stone. In one place might be seen a\r\nquantity of large empty wooden vessels; such they appeared to be, but in\r\nreality they had fallen from the Sapucaya tree. They are called\r\n_Monkey's Drinking-cups_ (Cuyas de Macaco), and are the capsules of the\r\nnuts sold under this appellation in Covent Garden Market. The top of the\r\nvessel is pierced with a circular hole, in which a natural lid fits\r\neasily. When the nuts ripen this lid becomes loosened, and down falls\r\nthe heavy shell with a crash, scattering the nuts over the ground. The\r\ntree[150] which bears this extraordinary burthen is of immense height.\r\nIt is closely allied to the Brazil-nut tree,[151] whose seeds are\r\nlikewise enclosed in large wooden vessels, but these are without lids,\r\nand fall entire to the ground. It is at least 120 feet high, and rises\r\nto the noble stature of 100 feet before it throws off any branches. From\r\ntwelve to twenty of these sweet edible nuts lie in a pod. The monkeys\r\nare very partial to them, and will patiently sit for hours hammering at\r\na capsule with a stone, in order to open it; and as soon as they have\r\nsucceeded, the on-lookers rush to the spot, to purloin as many as they\r\ncan. The natives assail the quarreling party with stones, a proceeding\r\nwhich incites the monkeys to revenge themselves by a discharge of nuts.\r\nBy this means the Indians load their boats without trouble, and the\r\nmonkeys are left to make a fresh foray.\"\r\n\r\nIn his forest wanderings, Mr. Bates was especially attracted by the\r\ncolossal trees. He says that, on the whole, they had not remarkably\r\nthick stems; the great and uniform height to which they grow without\r\nthrowing off a branch is a much more noticeable feature than their\r\nthickness; but at intervals he paused before a veritable giant. Only one\r\nof these huge patriarchs of the woods can flourish within a given space;\r\nit monopolizes the domain, and none but humble individuals can nestle\r\nwithin its shadow. The cylindrical trunks of these larger trees were\r\ngenerally about twenty to twenty-five feet in circumference. Von\r\nMartius, another Brazilian traveller, mentions having measured trees in\r\nthe Pará district, belonging to various species (Symphonia coccinea,\r\nLecythis spirula, and Cratæva Tapia), which were fifty to sixty feet in\r\ngirth at the point where they become cylindrical! The height of the vast\r\ncolumn-like stems could not be less than 100 feet from the ground to\r\ntheir lowest branch. The total height of the Pao d'Ano[152] and the\r\nMassaranduba, stem and crown together, may be computed at from 180 to\r\n200 feet. Where one of them stands, the vast canopy of leafiness rises\r\nabove the other forest trees like a domed cathedral above the minor\r\nbuildings of a city.\r\n\r\nA very curious feature in these trees is the growth of buttress-shaped\r\nprojections around the lower part of their stems. The spaces between\r\nthese buttresses, which may be compared to thin walls of wood, form\r\nspacious chambers, like stalls in a stable; some of them large enough to\r\nhold half-a-dozen persons. \"The purpose of these structures,\" says Mr.\r\nBates, \"is as obvious at the first glance, as that of the similar props\r\nof brickwork which support a high wall. They are not peculiar to one\r\nspecies, but are common to most of the larger forest trees. Their nature\r\nand manner of growth are explained when a series of young trees of\r\ndifferent ages is examined. It is then seen that they are the roots,\r\nwhich have raised themselves ridge-like out of the earth; growing\r\ngradually upwards as the increasing height of the tree required\r\naugmented support. Thus they are plainly intended to sustain the massive\r\ncrown and trunk in these crowded forests, where lateral growth of the\r\nroots in the earth is rendered difficult by the number of competitors.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other remarkable inhabitants of the Brazilian wilderness, we may\r\nname the lofty Moira-tingu,[153] the Samaüma,[154] and the Massaranduba\r\nor Cow tree.[155] The Eriodendron Samaüma, or Silk-cotton tree, holds in\r\nthe New World the same position as the Bombax in the Old. It rises to an\r\nenormous stature without branches, and then spreads out a glorious mass\r\nof foliage. The bark is light in colour; and the capsule pod contains a\r\nlarge quantity of down, of a brown tint, and exquisite silky softness.\r\nThe Massaranduba is also called the Palo de Vacca, the Arbor de Lacte,\r\nthe Galactodendron utile, or the Cow tree. Its bark furnishes an\r\nabundant supply of milk as pleasant to drink as that of the cow. If\r\nexposed to the air it thickens into a glue, which is excessively\r\ntenacious, and often employed to cement broken crockery. The tree has a\r\nwild, strange appearance, owing to its deeply scored, reddish, and\r\nrugged bark, a decoction of which is used as a red dye for cloth.\r\n\r\nDid our readers ever hear of the Pashiúba, or bulging-stemmed palm?[156]\r\nIt is not one of the tallest kinds, for its height, when full grown,\r\nseldom exceeds forty feet; the leaves are somewhat less drooping, and\r\nthe leaflets broader, than in other species; but if less beautiful, it\r\nis, perhaps, far more remarkable. Its roots grow above ground, radiating\r\nfrom the trunk at an elevation of ten or twelve feet, so that the tree\r\nseems to be supported on stilts; and when it is old, a person can stand\r\nupright amongst the roots with the perpendicular stem wholly above his\r\nhead! About midway, this stem bulges out in a circular swelling, which\r\ngives it its distinctive name. The roots closely resemble straight rods,\r\nbut they are studded with stout thorns, whilst the trunk of the Pashiúba\r\nis perfectly smooth.\r\n\r\nIt is in the vast primeval forests of Central and Southern America, and\r\nin the leafy wildernesses of the great East Indian islands--Borneo,\r\nSumatra, Java, Madagascar--that man may still contemplate in all its\r\nsavage majesty the prodigious Flora of the Tropics. These, too, are the\r\nhaunts of many remarkable animals--mammals, and birds, and\r\nreptiles--which are there comparatively safe from the pitiless\r\npersecution of the hunter and the trapper.\r\n\r\nTo obtain an idea--which, however, can only be very vague and\r\nimperfect--of the strange and imposing spectacle and the unexpected\r\nscenes which at every step astonish the traveller in the great Tropical\r\nwoodlands, we must study the descriptions of those few but richly\r\nendowed adventurers who, after exploring them with the enlightened\r\ncuriosity of science, have been able to embody the results in language\r\nworthy of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the foremost rank of those who have possessed the twofold\r\nqualification of scientific knowledge and descriptive power, we must\r\nplace the illustrious Humboldt. His works are a rich storehouse from\r\nwhich later writers have freely borrowed the materials of their essays.\r\nIn reference to the phrases \" Virgin Forest,\" \"Primeval Forest,\" he has\r\nsome judicious observations:--Ought we to call, he says, by either of\r\nthese appellations every kind of wild thick wood, encumbered with\r\nvigorous trees, upon which man has never laid his destructive hand? In\r\nthat case they would be appropriate in a number of very different\r\ncountries, under the Temperate, ay, and even under the Frigid Zone. But\r\nif we intend them to designate the impenetrability of an almost\r\nboundless forest, the impossibility of clearing a path with the\r\npioneer's axe between serried ranks of trees, not one of which is less\r\nthan from eight to ten feet in diameter, such virgin forests belong\r\nexclusively to tropical regions. We must not believe, however, according\r\nto the ordinary story in Europe, in the creeping parasitical lianas\r\nwhich, by the interlacement and entanglement of their branches, render\r\nthe equatorial forests impenetrable. The lianas form but a comparatively\r\ninsignificant portion of the underwood. The principal obstacle is found\r\nin the arborescent plants, which leave not a space uncovered, and this,\r\ntoo, in a country where all vegetables spreading over the soil become\r\nligneous. If a traveller, as soon as he arrives in a tropical clime,\r\nwhether in the continent or the islands, believes, even before he has\r\npenetrated inland, that he is transported to the heart of the virgin\r\nforests, his error simply originates in his impatience to realize a\r\nlong-cherished desire. All Tropical forests are not virgin forests.\r\n\r\nThe true virgin forests, notwithstanding the recent explorations of\r\nWallace, Bates, and Agassiz, are very imperfectly known; because it is,\r\nin truth, perfectly impossible to survey them in every direction, on\r\naccount of their vast extent and astonishing impenetrability. When we\r\nare told by the traveller that he opened for himself a path with his\r\ntrusty hatchet, we readily understand that he achieved his boasted\r\nvictory in places where the obstacles were reduced to feeble lianas and\r\nbrushwood of no great density, and that he turned aside from the massive\r\nbarriers formed by the closely-planted trunks of colossal trees. Than\r\nthese mighty vegetable Anakim, nothing, says a naturalist, is more\r\nimperfectly known in botany. The stems of most being bare and branchless\r\nup to a considerable height, their fructification is frequently beyond\r\nthe reach of man. In vain would he level them by their base: their\r\nsummits remain suspended by the inter-tanglement of the neighbouring\r\nsummits, and like so many Tantaluses, our travellers see themselves\r\nshunned by the fruits which their eyes devour. The rivers, those \"tracks\r\nwhich march\" through the leafy, woody depths, and the tortuous paths\r\ntrodden down by generations of wild beasts in their quest after new\r\npastures, after fresh hunting-grounds, or fountains to slake their\r\nthirst, are the only roads which can be pursued by the explorer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VIRGIN FOREST IN BRAZIL.]\r\n\r\nAs far as concerns their botanical composition, the virgin forests of\r\nthe Tropics are distinguished from those of cold and temperate regions\r\nby general characters which it will, perhaps, be useful to indicate. If,\r\nfor example, we adopt as our standard of comparison the European forest,\r\nwe there remark, in the first place, the complete absence of trees\r\nbelonging to the important groups of Acotyledons and Monocotyledons,\r\nand, in consequence, of the superb palms and elegant arboreal ferns of\r\ntropical countries. Or, considering only the Dicotyledonous plants, we\r\nsee again that, in lands bordering on the Equator, there is scarcely a\r\nfamily of this class which does not furnish its contingent of woody\r\nplants, offering most frequently, with forms of infinite variety,\r\nclearly displayed and brilliant flowers, remarkable either for their\r\nbeauty or their fragrance,--\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet as Sabæan odours from the shores\r\n     Of Araby the Blest;\"\r\n\r\nwhile our trees are comprised in a small number of natural groups, and\r\npresent in general very opposite features; as, for instance, an almost\r\nuniform character or aspect, and flowers scarcely visible and of little\r\nelegance.\r\n\r\nIt suffices to name the families of the Coniferæ and the Amentaceæ,\r\nwhich compose the greater portion of the Flora of our forests. Moreover,\r\nas Humboldt observes, in the Temperate Zone, particularly in Europe and\r\nthe north of Asia, certain species of trees (_plantæ sociales_) grow\r\ntogether, and form of themselves forests which we may designate by their\r\nspecific name. In the forests of oaks, firs, and birches which cover the\r\ncountries of the North, in the forests of limes of the East, one unique\r\nspecies of Amentaceæ, Coniferæ, or Tiliaceæ generally prevails. This\r\nuniform society is foreign to the Tropical forests. The infinite variety\r\nof flowers which expand in these _Hylææ_ do not permit us to ask of what\r\nthe virgin forests are composed. An innumerable quantity of different\r\nfamilies stand side by side; even in the most confined spaces it is rare\r\nto see trees of the same nature re-united. Every day, as the traveller\r\nadvances, he discovers new forms; oftentimes the outline of the leaf and\r\nthe ramification of a tree attract his attention, without his being able\r\nto distinguish the flowers.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another feature, more striking still, and more general than\r\nthose previously mentioned, which broadly distinguishes the arborescent\r\nvegetation of the Tropics from that of northern climates. Here the\r\nplants, exposed annually to an often intense degree of cold which lasts\r\nfor several months, experience a kind of suspension of their vital\r\nactivity, cease to flower and to fructify, and entirely shed their\r\nfoliage; the resinous species are the only exceptions to this rule. In\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Equator, on the contrary, it is during the\r\nhottest, driest season that vegetation suffers; then the herbaceous\r\nplants and bushes of the plains die down; but the great trees of the\r\nvirgin forests are hardly affected; their foliage incessantly renews\r\nitself; their branches are at all times loaded with fruits and flowers,\r\nand to the wayfarer's eyes they present the glorious spectacle of an\r\neternal freshness, of a life which never wanes.\r\n\r\nCompared with these great points of difference, common to all the virgin\r\nforests of the Tropics, the peculiar features resulting from the\r\nbotanical constitution which distinguishes more or less exactly one\r\nregion from another, have, as the reader will understand, but a\r\nsecondary importance.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few countries which possess a Flora _sui\r\ngeneris_--such, for example, as Madagascar and Australia--the same\r\naspects, the same general forms are almost everywhere reproduced.\r\n\r\nMore distinctive differences may be remarked, at the first glance, in\r\nthe animal life which peoples the forests of the different quarters of\r\nthe world; but yet these animals everywhere display the same habits. The\r\ngreat majority of the insects and the birds, the apes, the squirrels,\r\nand, in general, all the arboreal animals, awake and put themselves in\r\nmotion at the first glimpse of day, and animate the forest with their\r\nmurmurs, their songs, their utterances, their lively sports and\r\nfrolicsome gambols.\r\n\r\nI borrow from the entertaining pages of an English traveller the\r\nfollowing description of the diurnal cycle of phenomena which revolves\r\nin the depths of a virgin forest.[157]\r\n\r\nIn the early dawn the sky is invariably cloudless; the heavy dew or the\r\nprevious night's rain, which lay on the moist foliage, becoming quickly\r\ndissipated by the glowing sun, which, rising straight out of the east,\r\nmounts rapidly towards the zenith. All nature is fresh, new leaves and\r\nflower-buds expanding rapidly. Some mornings a single tree will appear\r\nin flower amidst what was the preceding evening a uniform green mass of\r\nforest--a dome of blossom suddenly created as if by magic. The birds are\r\nall active; from the wild fruit trees, not far off, we hear the shrill\r\nyelping of the Tucano (_Ramphastos vitellinus_). Small flocks of parrots\r\nflow over on most mornings at a great height, appearing in distinct\r\nrelief against the blue sky, always two by two chattering to each other,\r\nthe pairs being separated by regular intervals. Their bright colours,\r\nhowever, are not discernible at such a height.\r\n\r\nTowards two o'clock the heat rapidly increases, and every voice of bird\r\nor mammal grows hushed; only in the trees sounds at intervals the harsh\r\nwhirr of a cicada. The leaves, so moist and fresh in early morning, now\r\nbecome lax and drooping; the flowers shed their petals. On most days in\r\nJune or July a heavy shower will fall some time in the afternoon,\r\nproducing a most welcome coolness. The approach of the rain clouds takes\r\nplace after a uniform fashion very interesting to observe. First, the\r\ncool sea-breeze, which commenced to blow about ten o'clock, and which\r\nincreases in force with the increasing power of the sun, flags, and\r\nfinally dies away. The heat and electric tension of the atmosphere then\r\ngrows almost insupportable. Languor and uneasiness seize on every one;\r\neven the denizens of the forest betraying it by their motions. White\r\nclouds rising in the east gather into cumuli, with an increasing\r\nblackness along their lower portions. The whole eastern horizon becomes\r\nalmost suddenly black, and this darkness spreads upwards, obscuring the\r\n\"orb of day.\"\r\n\r\nThen through the forest hurtles a mighty wind, swaying the lofty\r\ntree-tops; a vivid flash of lightning bursts forth, then breaks a crash\r\nof thunder, and down streams the deluging rain. Such storms soon cease,\r\nleaving bluish-black motionless clouds in the sky until night. Meantime\r\nall nature is refreshed; but heaps of flower-leaves and fallen petals\r\nlie under the trees. Towards evening life revives again, and the ringing\r\nuproar is resumed from bush and tree. The following morning the sun\r\nagain rises in a cloudless sky, and so the cycle is completed; spring,\r\nsummer, and autumn, as it were, in one tropical day. The days are more\r\nor less like this throughout the year in this country. A little\r\ndifference exists between the dry and wet seasons; but generally the dry\r\nseason, which lasts from July to December, is varied with showers; and\r\nthe wet, from January to June, with sunny days.\r\n\r\n\"It results from this,\" says Mr. Bates, \"that the periodical phenomena\r\nof plants and animals do not take place at about the same time in all\r\nspecies, or in the individuals of any given species, as they do in\r\ntemperate countries. Of course there is no hybernation, nor, as the dry\r\nseason is not excessive, is there any summer torpidity as in some\r\ntropical countries. Plants do not flower or shed their leaves, nor do\r\nbirds moult, pair, or breed simultaneously. In Europe, a woodland scene\r\nhas its spring, its summer, its autumnal, and its winter aspects. In the\r\nequatorial forests the aspect is the same, or nearly so, every day in\r\nthe year--budding, flowering, fruiting, and leaf-shedding are always\r\ngoing on in one species or other. The activity of birds and insects\r\nproceeds without interruption, each species having its own separate\r\ntimes. The colonies of wasps, for instance, do not die off annually,\r\nleaving only the queens, as in cold climates; but the succession of\r\ngenerations and colonies goes on incessantly. It is never either spring,\r\nsummer, or autumn, but each day is a combination of all three. With the\r\nday and night always of equal length, the atmospheric disturbances of\r\neach day neutralizing themselves before each succeeding morn; with the\r\nsun in its course proceeding mid-way across the sky, and the daily\r\ntemperature the same within two or three degrees throughout the year,\r\nhow grand in its perfect equilibrium and simplicity is the march of\r\nNature under the equator!\"\r\n\r\nNow night comes on, not, as in temperate climes, with a hush and a\r\nsilence that are almost breathless, but with a thousand strange and\r\nformidable sounds. In Asia, in Africa, in America, as well as in the\r\ngreat islands of the Pacific Ocean, the forests and the savannahs\r\nre-echo all night with discordant cries. The branches are torn down with\r\na crash as the beasts of prey sweep past, and earth resounds beneath\r\ntheir headlong steps. It is no longer the gay, fresh movement of happy\r\nlife which in the golden noon of day converts the forest into a\r\nveritable Eden; it is the rush to and fro of scattered animals, pressed\r\nby hunger and thirst, either in flight or pursuit; it is the roar of\r\nrage or the wail of agony; it is, in a word, the mêlée of sharpened\r\nappetites; it is the \"Witches' Sabbath\" of the savage world, at which no\r\nEuropean, however hardened by the perils of an adventurous career, can\r\nbe present for the first time without experiencing a deep emotion of\r\nmelancholy and apprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE LIFE IN THE FORESTS OF THE OLD WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not think that in all Europe, nor, indeed, in the entire Temperate\r\nZone of the Old World, exists such an agglomeration of plants and trees\r\nas may merit the appellation of \"primeval\" or \"virgin forest.\" At all\r\nevents, this forest, if it really exists, will assuredly be composed of\r\nthe very trees which we see every day in our own woods, our fields, our\r\nparks, and even in our towns, and which have long ceased to awaken in\r\nus the idea of wild nature. With the woods of Great Britain, France, or\r\nSpain we are all familiar:--\r\n\r\n                            \"The beam\r\n    Of noon is broken there by chestnut boughs\r\n    Down the steep verdant sides; the air\r\n    So freshened by the leaping stream, which throws\r\n    Eternal showers of spray on the mossed roots\r\n    Of trees, and veins of turf, and long dark shoots\r\n    Of ivy-plants, and fragrant hanging bells\r\n    Of hyacinths, and on late anemones\r\n    That muffle its wet banks.\"[158]\r\n\r\nOur poets have sung of the murmurous groves of pines, and the deep dark\r\nbeech-woods that clothe with shadows the rounded forms of the\r\nchalk-hills, and the long alleys of blossoming chestnut, fragrant lime,\r\nor sombre yew. Therefore, without losing valuable time in these familiar\r\nshades, without pausing before the oak which the history of a thousand\r\nyears has made immortal, let us rapidly traverse the Corsican forests,\r\nwhere among the twisted leaves of the elms flourishes the gigantic\r\nLarician pine; those of Greece, where thrive the pines of Cephalonia and\r\nApollo, and the oaks sacred also to the divinity of Delphi and\r\nDodona--those oaks, dumb to-day, which formerly gave utterance to\r\noracles not less reverend than those of the Pythoness. We will not even\r\nsuffer ourselves to be delayed among the forests of Eastern Europe, of\r\nAsia Minor, and of Persia, where dominate such species as the pine, the\r\nbeech, and the chestnut. It is not until we have crossed the Indus--that\r\nmighty river on whose banks halted the legions of Alexander--that the\r\nexuberant vegetation of the Tropical world breaks upon us in all its\r\nglorious verdure and prodigious richness, though confined to a\r\ncomparatively limited area.\r\n\r\nThe wooded region of the western Ghauts, from Goa to Cape Camorin,\r\nexhibits the greatest abundance of plants peculiar to Southern Asia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TROPICAL VEGETATION.\r\n\r\n1. Calamus Rotang.\r\n2. Bamboos.\r\n3. Borassus flabelliformis.\r\n4. Diospyros ebenum.]\r\n\r\nTo form an idea of the variety and potency of the Flora of this region,\r\nsays M. Lanoye,[159] we must contemplate the specimens immured in our\r\nEuropean gardens, and augment tenfold their etiolated proportions; we\r\nmust bring together, in the dazzling confusion of Nature, the Mimosas,\r\nthe Musas, the odorous Screw-pines, the Mangoes, and the Orange trees;\r\ntwine around their trunks the many-branched stems of the Bignonias, the\r\nNagatelly, the Dictantes-Sambas, and the Lianas which furnish pepper and\r\nthe betel-nut; group under their shade the most beautiful varieties of\r\nAzaleas, Jasmines, and Gardenias; unite those Laurels whence we extract\r\ncamphor, cassia, and cinnamon, with the red Santul, the Nopals, and the\r\nDragon trees which supply the costly gum-lacs; the Shrubs which give us\r\nspikenard, cardamoms, and amome, with those Canes which secrete sugar.\r\nAbove these masses of flowers, above these sources of honey and perfume,\r\nwe must next display the immense leaves of the Talipot and the\r\nBourbon-palm, must spread in undulations the aërial palm-crests of the\r\nCocoa-nut and the gigantic Bamboo; must accumulate the sombre verdure of\r\nthe Teaks and the Tamarinds, and the impenetrable branches of the\r\nconsecrated Pines. Then, all this being accomplished, we shall still\r\nhave but a vague and colourless perception of the Indian Flora, and\r\nnotably of that which clothes the base of the Western Ghauts to the east\r\nand to the south of the city of Goa.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of picturing to ourselves the entirety of so glorious and\r\nrich a scene reveals the impossibility of seizing all its details, of\r\nstudying one by one all its elements. Our attention, however, will be\r\narrested by a small number of species remarkable above all others by\r\ntheir extraordinary dimensions, the elegance of their bearing, the\r\nbeauty of their flowers and foliage, or by some peculiar and destructive\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWe notice in the first place several trees whose close relationship\r\ncannot be mistaken to the date trees which we have already met with in\r\nthe open Desert, and which, we may remember, constituted the entire\r\nwealth of the inhabitants of the oases. We find representatives of the\r\nimmense family of palms in every tropical country, and even in the coral\r\nislands of the great ocean. India possesses several species. I shall\r\nrefer only to the _Borassus flabelliformis_, whose trunk, 90 to 120\r\nfeet in height, is surmounted by a crown of great fan-shaped leaves,\r\nfolded longitudinally in their first half, cut in the other, and\r\nsustained by prickly supports. The other half is made use of by the\r\nHindus in the shape of paper, or rather tablets, on which they write\r\nwith the point of a stylet. The spadices (clustered flowers), if incised\r\nbefore reaching maturity, yield a liquid which, after fermentation,\r\nforms the favourite Indian beverage of \"palm wine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bamboo, the most gigantic of the tropical Gramineæ, is plentifully\r\ndistributed over India, Indo-China, and China, where it frequently\r\nflourishes in considerable masses. In height it equals the loftiest\r\npalms. Its culm is smooth, glittering, straight, and flexible, of a\r\nbeautiful yellow colour, and regularly intersected by annular rings\r\nmarked by so many brown streaks. It wavers gently to and fro with the\r\nimpulse of the wind, as if to refresh with its breath the light\r\nundulating foliage.\r\n\r\nAlmost innumerable are the services which this heaven-sent plant renders\r\nto the inhabitants of the countries where it flourishes. In hedges or\r\nplantations it forms around their abodes a formidable defence. With its\r\nstems sawn either in accordance with their diameter, or split\r\nlongitudinally, the natives not only fabricate a host of utensils and\r\narticles of furniture, but build their barks and construct their houses.\r\nThey extract from the spaces between the joints of the young plant a\r\nfeculent substance which supplies them with an agreeable nutriment,\r\nanalogous to _sago_. A saccharine juice flows spontaneously from the\r\njoints formed by the knots; when fermented it becomes alcoholic and\r\nheady like hydromel. The bamboo also proves serviceable in the\r\nmanufacture of mats and cordage. The slender stems are split into thin\r\nstrips, which are probably softened in water. These strips, woven\r\ntogether, form mats or carpets of extreme solidity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Banana,[160] like the Bamboo and most of the palms, is a\r\ncosmopolitan plant throughout the tropic world. Its native habitat is\r\nsupposed to be Asia. The Oriental Christians have a tradition that this\r\ntree, which they call the _Lignum Vitæ_, was that whose fruit was\r\nforbidden to our first parents. Hence the name of _Musa paradisiaca_,\r\ngiven by botanists to one of the two species of the genus; the other is\r\nthe Banana of the wise men, _Musa sapientum_. However this may be, it is\r\ncertain that if the use of the banana was at any time interdicted to\r\nman, the prohibition has been annulled for many generations; and its\r\nfruits form one of the most wholesome and most general articles of food\r\nin tropical countries. Although the wild banana maintains its place\r\nhonourably in the forests of these regions, it is not a tree, but an\r\nherbaceous plant. It propagates itself through its suckers, and its stem\r\nperishes immediately after fructification. Its mode of vegetation is\r\nanalogous to that of the Liliaceæ. From a bulbous and fleshy platform\r\nissue, beneath, its fibrous roots; above, enormous leaves, often nearly\r\na yard wide and two to three yards long. The petioles of these leaves\r\nare adhesive. By folding themselves one over another, and successively\r\ndrying up, they grow into a stem which sometimes attains the dimensions\r\nof the trunk of an ordinary tree (about seven feet) and the stature of\r\ntwelve to sixteen feet, and which is traversed throughout its centre by\r\na stalk springing from the bulb. This stalk rises again several inches\r\nabove the terminal leaf, then bends, sinks towards the ground, and\r\nterminates in a stem which carries at its extremity the male flowers,\r\nand at its base the female flowers, then the fruit. The latter,\r\ncollected in clusters of twelve to fourteen, are elongated, of a\r\nprismatic triangular form, enveloped in a rind, green at first, then\r\nyellow, and internally consist of a soft, feculent, sugary pulp, very\r\nnutritious, and agreeable to the taste.\r\n\r\nIn its native clime the banana is born, grows, flourishes, fructifies,\r\nand dies in the space of twelve or eighteen months. In the climates most\r\nakin to ours, and in our European gardens, its development is not only\r\non a smaller scale, but occupies a longer period, and it has been known\r\nto reach the age of ten or a dozen years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BANYAN TREE (_Ficus Indica_).]\r\n\r\nBy the side of these weak-stemmed plants, with their soft and spongy\r\ncontexture, grow hosts of robust trees, whose timber is compact and\r\nsometimes exceedingly hard, and whose branches are of immense span. My\r\nreaders will probably remember the lines in which Southey so admirably\r\ndescribes one of the most majestic and most singular of these: the\r\nBanyan, or Indian Fig-tree (_Ficus Indica_),[161] also designated the\r\n\"Multiplying Fig-tree,\" the \"Admirable Fig-tree,\" and \"Tree of Life.\"\r\nThe passage will bear transcription:[162]--\r\n\r\n          \"It was a goodly sight to see\r\n              That venerable tree,\r\n        For o'er the lawn, irregularly spread,\r\n    Fifty straight columns propped its lofty head;\r\n          And many a long depending shoot\r\n              Seeking to strike its root,\r\n    Straight, like a plummet, grew towards the ground.\r\n    Some on the lower boughs, which crossed their way,\r\n    Fixing their bearded fibres, round and round,\r\n    With many a ring and wild contortion wound;\r\n    Some to the passing wind, at times with sway\r\n              Of gentle motion swung;\r\n    Others of younger growth, unmoved, were hung\r\n    Like stone-drops from the cavern's fretted height.\r\n          Beneath was smooth and fair to sight,\r\n    Nor weeds nor briars deformed the natural floor;\r\n    And through the leafy cope which bowered it o'er,\r\n          Came gleams of chequered light.\"\r\n\r\nThe Banyan surpasses in diameter the finest oaks of Europe, and throws\r\noff numerous branches, of which several redescend towards the earth,\r\nforce their way into it, take root therein, and in their turn develop\r\ninto new trunks, whence spring other boughs that go through the same\r\nprocess of fructification; so that a single stem spreads in time into a\r\nkind of forest, and the canopy formed by the outgrowth of a solitary\r\ntree will frequently overshadow an area of 1700 square yards.\r\n\r\nThe evergreen foliage of this beautiful tree forms an immense vault,\r\nwhich has justly been compared to the domed roof of a stately edifice\r\nsupported by a host of columns. Here a myriad birds raise their songs of\r\njoy; underneath, the weary pilgrim finds a delightful asylum; from\r\nbranch to branch leap the mocking ape and the nimble squirrel. The\r\nHindus hold their \"Pagod tree\" in great veneration. It is to them one of\r\nthe emblems of their god Siva, and in its dense deep shade they assemble\r\nto celebrate their sacrificial rites, whether in honour of this potent\r\ndeity, or whether in honour of Ganesha, a rural divinity, analogous in\r\nhis attributes to the Pan of the Greeks and Latins.\r\n\r\nSeveral other tropical trees possess, like the banyan, the property of\r\nproducing adventitious roots which spring from the trunk or branches\r\nwhich implant themselves in the soil; but not one enjoys an equal power\r\nof reproduction and multiplication.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest trees of southern Asia, and possibly one of the\r\ngreatest in the world, is the Teak or Indian Oak (_Tectona grandis_),\r\nwhich covers vast areas of ground in Hindostan. It flourishes also in\r\nPegu, Ava, Siam, Java, and the Burman Empire. It works easily, and\r\nthough porous, is permanent and strong; is readily seasoned, and shrinks\r\nbut little; is of an oleaginous character, and therefore does not\r\ncorrode iron. It is as strong as oak, and more buoyant. Its durability\r\nis more uniform and decided; and to insure that durability it needs less\r\ncare and preparation; for it may be taken into use almost green from the\r\nforest, without danger of dry or wet rot. It will endure all climates\r\nand all alternations of climate.[163]\r\n\r\nThe teak of Malabar, grown on the high table-lands in the south of\r\nIndia, is esteemed the best, because it is the heaviest, the most\r\ndurable, contains the most oil, and is the closest in its fibre. Next in\r\nquality ranks that of Java, and inferior to these in some respects is\r\nthe teak of Burmah, Rangoon, and Siam; which, however, is the most\r\nbuoyant, and the best fitted for masts and spars.\r\n\r\nAfrican teak, let me note, is not teak properly so called, but the\r\ntimber of the _Oldfieldia Africana_. It is largely imported from the\r\nwest coast of Africa, and though an useful wood, lacks the most valuable\r\nproperties of the genuine teak.\r\n\r\nThe teak is a handsome and even stately tree, often attaining the noble\r\nstature of 130 to 150 feet, with a trunk of proportionate diameter,\r\nupright, well-shaped, and surmounted by wide-spread branches. Its large\r\nleaves are oval, of a velvety under-surface, and besprinkled on the\r\nupper with whitish spots. Its flowers cluster at the extremity of the\r\nbranch in an ample and beautiful panicle. The poisonous properties of\r\nits wood preserve it from the attacks of vermin, but render it dangerous\r\nto work, for men who are but lightly wounded by its splinters die after\r\na very brief interval.\r\n\r\nA less useful timber than the teak, but much esteemed for the\r\nmanufacture of articles of luxury, is furnished by the _Diospyros\r\nebenum_ and the _Santalum album_.\r\n\r\nIn the Flora of tropical Asia a very important position is occupied by\r\nthe Laurel family. Several species of this family deserve to be\r\nparticularized on account of their commercial value: thus, from the\r\n_Laurus camphora_ comes the camphor most esteemed by British physicians,\r\nwhile the aromatic rinds of the _Laurus cinnamomum_, _Culilawan_,\r\n_Malabathrum_, and _Cassia_, constitute the various kinds of cinnamon.\r\nThe _Laurus cassia_ is not to be confounded with another Indian tree,\r\none of the Leguminosæ, the _Cassia fistula_, whose enormous cods\r\nformerly played an important rôle under the name of Cassia in\r\ntherapeutic science. While speaking of trees which produce aromatic\r\nsubstances, I must not forget to mention the _Styrax benzoïn_, and the\r\n_Boswellia serrata_. The former is a member of the family _Styracaceæ_,\r\nwhose trees or shrubs, chiefly tropical, are known by their monopetalous\r\nflowers, their epipetalous stamens, their long radicle, leafy\r\ncotyledons, and by a part at least of the ovules being suspended. The\r\n_Styrax benzoïn_, a native of the Indian islands, yields the resin\r\ncalled benzoin. The juice exudes from incisions made in the bark, and\r\nwhen dried, is removed by a knife or chisel. Each tree yields about\r\nthree pounds' weight annually, the gum formed during the first three\r\nyears being superior in quality to that which subsequently exudes. It is\r\nlargely employed by perfumers, and in medicine is esteemed a remedy for\r\nchronic pulmonary disorders. _Styrax officinale_, a native of the\r\nLevant, furnishes the balsamic resinous substance known as storax, which\r\nis also one of the materials manipulated by perfumers, and in medicine\r\nis used as a stimulating expectorant.\r\n\r\nThe _Boswellia serrata_ supplies the fragrant incense whose vapours were\r\nanciently supposed to be peculiarly agreeable to the gods made by man's\r\nhands or conceived by his imagination.\r\n\r\nIndia is also the native country and home-land of the Indigo plants\r\n(_Indigofera tinctoria_, and _Indigofera anil_, of the Leguminosæ\r\nfamily), and the _Gossypiums_, from whose expanded fruits is obtained\r\nthe all-powerful cotton; and in Cochin-China we meet with the _Croton\r\nsebiferum_ or _Stillingia sebifera_ (family of the Euphorbiaceæ), whose\r\nberries contain a rich concrete substance called \"tree-tallow,\"\r\nemployed, in the far East, in the manufacture of tapers. The latter\r\ntree, popularly known as the \"Tallow Tree,\" has rhomboid leaves, with\r\ntwo prominent glands at the point of attachment between the stalk and\r\nthe leaf; and its flower catkins are from two to four inches long. \"Its\r\nfruits contain three seeds thickly coated with a fatty substance which\r\nyields the tallow. This is obtained by steaming the seeds in large\r\ncaldrons, and then bruising them sufficiently to loosen the fat without\r\nbreaking the seeds, which are removed by sifting. The fat is afterwards\r\nmade into flat circular cakes, and pressed in a wedge-press, when the\r\npure tallow exudes in a liquid state, and soon hardens into a white\r\nbrittle mass. This tallow is very extensively used for candle-making in\r\nChina; but as the candles made of it become soft in hot weather, they\r\ngenerally receive a coating of insect wax. A liquid oil is obtained from\r\nthe seeds by pressing. The tree yields a hard wood used by the Chinese\r\nfor printing blocks, and its leaves are employed for dyeing black.\"[164]\r\n\r\nClimbing and epiphytous[165] plants are very numerous in India; but\r\nthere are none, perhaps, which in vegetative force and tenacity can be\r\ncompared to those of the _Calamus_, and particularly of the _Calamus\r\nrotang_ (family of the _Palmaceæ_). These Lianas are all remarkable for\r\ntheir flexible stem, which attaches itself to the trees, and frequently\r\nattains the prodigious length of 200, 250, 300, and even 350 yards. This\r\nstem is formed of a series of internodes, or jointed pieces, more or\r\nless wide apart, each of which bears a leathery flower, with elongated\r\nsheath. The Calami frequently render the forests which they inhabit\r\nvirtually impenetrable, through their long, flexible, and tenacious\r\narms, stretching across from tree to tree, or crawling over the ground,\r\nand bristling with formidable thorns. It is these stems which are\r\nimported into Europe as bamboos, cut into different lengths, and there\r\nemployed for various industrial purposes.\r\n\r\nBut it is time we took our leave of India, and allowed \"observation with\r\nextensive view\" to survey the far-spreading African forests. There, in\r\nthe first place, we are called upon to salute the patriarch of the\r\ntropical Flora, the _Baobab_ (_Adansonia digitata_), a gigantic genus of\r\nthe family _Bombaceæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Baobab. 2. Elæis Guinensis, or Guinea Palm. 3. Acacia\r\nverek.]\r\n\r\nThis colossus of the vegetable world was discovered in Senegal by the\r\nFrench botanist Adanson, in 1749. He measured the trunks of several\r\nindividuals, and found them from 65 to 78 feet in circumference, with\r\nmighty branches, each of which was equal to a great oak or magnificent\r\nchestnut. One baobab he computed at 90 feet in girth, and its rounded\r\ncrest extended over an area of upwards of 170 yards in circuit. A root\r\nwhich was exposed to view, through the washing away of the superjacent\r\nsoil, measured 110 feet in length. Adanson estimated the age of some of\r\nthese Anakim of trees at 1500 years. They were just shooting above the\r\nground, if this reckoning be true, at the time that Constantine, the\r\nfirst Christian emperor, removed the seat of empire from Rome to\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nThere are other gigantic trees in the forests of Senegambia, as, for\r\ninstance, the _Khaya Senegalensis_, which rears its crest to a height of\r\n50 or 60 yards, whose hard reddish-coloured timber belongs to the\r\nspecies known in commerce under the name of _Mahogany_. Another kind of\r\nmahogany, but less valuable, called Senegal Mahogany, is furnished by\r\nthe _Swietenia Senegalensis_ (family of _Meliaceæ_, tribe of\r\n_Cedrelaceæ_), named after Baron von Swieten, a Dutch botanist. It forms\r\na stately tree, some 60 or 80 feet high. _Swietenia Mahogani_, a native\r\nof the warmer regions of America and the West Indies, yields the\r\nmahogany of commerce. The first discovery of the existence of this kind\r\nof wood is ascribed to the carpenter on board Sir Walter Raleigh's\r\nvessel, when lying off Trinidad in 1595. It is not considered to reach\r\nperfection under the venerable age of two hundred years. The seeds\r\nprepared with oil are used by the modern Mexicans, as they were by the\r\nancient Aztecs, for cosmetic purposes; and the bark is considered a\r\nfebrifuge.\r\n\r\nAmong the most curious trees of the Senegal, whose Flora has quite a\r\ncharacter of its own, travellers have singled out the Butter Tree\r\n(_Bassia butyracea_, family of the _Sapotaceæ_), whose fruits contain an\r\nedible fatty substance, used by the natives as a substitute for butter;\r\nand the Henna (_Lawsonia inermis_), which also flourishes on the eastern\r\ncoast and in Upper Egypt. The henna is a shrub from six to seven feet\r\nhigh. Its flowers exhale a goat-like odour, which seems much affected by\r\nthe Orientals and the natives of Africa. Its roots, of a deep red hue,\r\nare distinguished by a bitter taste and astringent properties. Finally,\r\nits leaves supply an orange-red colouring matter, with which the Arabs\r\nand negroes tint their hair, beard, and nails.\r\n\r\nLet us not pass over without the tribute of our respectful notice the\r\nnumerous tribe of Acacias, which form vast forests in the districts\r\nnorth of the Senegal, and yield the gum-arabic of commerce. The best\r\nknown species of this important and useful group are the _Acacia\r\nArabica_, or Red Gum-tree, the _Acacia Adansoni_, the _Acacia vera_, and\r\nthe _Acacia verek_.\r\n\r\nWe also meet at Senegal with a tree which I ought, perhaps, to have\r\nranked of right among those of India, and which, like many others,\r\nbelong rather to the whole zone of the Tropics than to any particular\r\ncountry; I refer to the Tamarind (_Tamarindus Indica_),[166] whose\r\nwell-known name is supposed to be derived from the Arabic _Tamar_,\r\nsignifying \"dates,\" and _Indus_, in allusion to its original habitat.\r\nThere is only one species of the genus, but the East Indian variety has\r\nlong pods, with six to twelve seeds, while the West Indian has much\r\nshorter pods, containing one to four seeds. It is a tree of graceful\r\nappearance, with elegant pinnated foliage and numerous racemes of\r\nfragrant flowers. The pods are slightly curved, and consist of a brittle\r\nbrown shell, enclosing a soft, acid, brown pulp, traversed by strong\r\nwoody fibres; a thin membranous covering wraps up the seeds. The pulp\r\nhas a savour at once acid and sugary, and acts as a gentle laxative. The\r\ntimber is useful for building purposes, and furnishes excellent charcoal\r\nfor the manufacture of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nThe _Sterculiaceæ_ have numerous representatives at the Senegal. These\r\ntall and handsome trees remind the traveller in their appearance of our\r\nEnglish oaks. The seeds of the _Sterculia acuminata_ and _tomentosa_ are\r\nmasticated by the negroes until reduced to a fluid paste, in which form\r\nthey employ it to dye their cotton-stuffs yellow. The dye is very\r\nbright, and, it is said, extremely durable.\r\n\r\nWe know that a great part of the Gaboon is occupied by virgin forests,\r\nwhere Fig-trees are predominant, and in marshy soils the Mangle or\r\nMangrove trees (_Rhizophora mangle_), which must not be confounded with\r\nthe savoury-fruited Mangoes of Eastern India. The Mangroves form, in the\r\nfamily of the _Rhizophoras_, a genus distributed in the moist\r\nlocalities of the Tropics, and we shall hereafter meet with them in\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nEquatorial Africa possesses several species of Palm-trees peculiar to\r\nit. Such are the Thorny Date-tree, the _Borassus_ of Ethiopia, the\r\n_Raphia vinifera_ of Congo, which, as its name \"wine-bearing\" indicates,\r\nfurnishes a wine analogous to that extracted in other regions from other\r\ntrees of the same family; the _Elæis Guinensis_, or Guinea Palm, whence\r\nwe obtain the well-known product of palm oil. This oil, or palm-tree\r\nbutter, forms an important article of food among the Guinea negroes. It\r\nis imported into Europe in large quantities, and employed in the\r\nmanufacture of soap.\r\n\r\nThe forests of the Hottentot and Bechuana countries, and in general of\r\nall those regions bordering on the Cape Colony, are frequently of great\r\nextent, but mainly composed of trees of small stature, or even of\r\nshrubs, such as the Cape Olive, a few Acacias, some Compositæ and\r\nConifers. Forests, as I have said, are rare in the explored portions of\r\nthe west African coast; they become denser and more numerous as we leave\r\nthe great ocean in our rear, and penetrate into that vast interior which\r\nfor ages has been haunted by so many mysteries. Their Flora, however,\r\noffers no special character, and does not materially differ from that of\r\nGuinea and Senegambia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE LIFE IN THE FORESTS OF THE GREAT ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that under the same parallels of latitude, or under\r\nneighbouring parallels, the physiognomy of the virgin forests was\r\neverywhere nearly the same, and hence we must study from a point close\r\nat hand the species which compose them, to determine the distinctive\r\ncharacters of the great agglomerations of vegetables peculiar to\r\ndifferent countries. And yet the traveller who, after having explored\r\nthe primeval forests of Africa and Asia, should be transported to the\r\nwild and wooded regions of the great Indian Archipelago and the Pacific\r\nOcean, could not fail to be struck with the novel spectacle presented to\r\nhis gaze. Undoubtedly he would meet, at first, with a great number of\r\nplants not unknown to him; but he would not fail to discover many others\r\nwhich he had not hitherto observed, and especially would he contemplate\r\nwith astonishment--perhaps with admiration--the chaos of this rich,\r\nvarious, dense, but disordered vegetation. It seems, in truth, as if\r\nwithin these \"summer isles of Eden\" Nature had hastened to accumulate\r\nher choicest products, and feeling herself restricted within narrow\r\nlimits, had carefully laboured not to lose the smallest particle of\r\nspace--not even of the aërial territory, if I may so speak--allotted to\r\nher. Not only are the trees set in the closest possible array, but they\r\nstruggle with wonderful effort to develop the exuberance of their\r\nstrength. Nearly all display an abundant and persistent foliage; their\r\nbranches are, in general, thick and spongy, and begin to shoot at the\r\nbase of the trunk; in such wise that the lower boughs extend close to\r\nthe ground, and by interlacing with those of neighbouring trees, form\r\nimpenetrable thickets. Many send forth, from their trunk and their\r\nbranches, frail flexible roots like the lianas, which descend to the\r\nearth, plant themselves in the soil, and contribute to render the\r\nforests absolutely impervious. Nor is this all; the plants grow there,\r\nliterally, one upon another. Nowhere, under the Tropics, does one see a\r\nsimilar profusion of epiphytous plants; not a single tree but is invaded\r\nby the close-clinging roots and flexible ramifications of these\r\nparasites, mingled with brightly-blossoming lianas, whose multifold\r\nstems are of immeasurable length. Species worthy of note, either on\r\naccount of their beauty, their various uses, or formidable poisonous\r\nproperties, and belonging to widely-differing families, abound,\r\nmoreover, in these perennial forests.\r\n\r\nCeylon, which has justly been named by the Orientals \"a pearl detached\r\nfrom Hindostan,\" so admirable is its situation, so marvellous is its\r\nfertility, so exhaustless its mineral wealth, is the native country of\r\nthe _Laurus cinnamomum_--which was early transplanted to the\r\nneighbouring continent--and of the Artocarpus, or Bread-fruit tree, one\r\nof the most curious and most useful plants of this region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BREAD-FRUIT TREE OF CEYLON (_Artocarpus incisa_).]\r\n\r\nThe Bread-fruit Tree (_Artocarpus incisa_) is a tree of the family\r\n_Muriaceæ_, some 45 to 55 feet high. Make an incision in its bark,\r\nwherever you will, and it exudes a white lacteal fluid, which hardens on\r\nexposure to the air. Its branches are very numerous, and those nearest\r\nits base attain a considerable length. Its leaves are large, consistent,\r\nand somewhat deeply cut. It owes its name of \"Bread-fruit tree\" to its\r\novoid or rounded fruit, about the size of an ostrich's egg, which forms\r\nthe staple food of the Cingalese. When fully ripe, the pulp or flesh is\r\nwhite, firm, farinaceous, and very agreeable to the taste. The natives\r\nboil it whole, or cut it into slices for roasting, and prepare it for\r\nthe table in numerous other modes. Two or three trees, it is said,\r\nsuffice for the provisioning of one man. My readers will remember that\r\nits introduction in the West Indian Islands was signalized by the famous\r\nMutiny of the Bounty, and led indirectly to the settlement of Pitcairn's\r\nIsland; thus originating a strange and sufficiently poetical romance.\r\n\r\nIn the forests of Ceylon also flourish the _Cambogia Guttu_, the\r\n_Stalagmites Cambogioides_, and the _Garcinia morella_ (family\r\n_Guttiferæ_), whence camboge is extracted. This substance, at once\r\nmedicinal and tinctorial, exudes in a liquid state from wounds made in\r\nthe bark of the trees; it solidifies spontaneously in the vessels\r\nwherein it is collected.\r\n\r\nImmense forests overspread the humid plains of Sumatra. They are\r\nconstituted in the main of numerous species of Fig-trees (_Ficoidæ_),\r\nwhose abundant and persistent leaves form an obscure vault, impenetrable\r\nby the sun's \"golden arrows.\" Above this leafy dome shoot the rigid\r\ntrunks of trees of lofty stature. Of these, the most remarkable,\r\nperhaps, is the Ipo-antiar (_Antiaris toxicaria_), whose juice, after\r\nhaving undergone certain preparations, becomes one of the deadliest\r\nknown poisons. It was for a long time unknown with what substance the\r\nMalays envenomed their arrows and their famous _kris_, or crease; nor\r\nwas it until the beginning of the present century that the traveller\r\nLeschenault ascertained, not without difficulty, that it had for its\r\nbasis the juice of a very tall tree, with decaying leaves, to which he\r\ngave the name of _Antiaris toxicaria_. This is the celebrated Upas,\r\nwhose deadly properties were formerly exaggerated in so many wonderful\r\nfables. The poison is prepared in an earthen vessel, and mixed up with\r\ncertain quantities of the seed of the pimento and the pepper tree, and\r\nthe roots of various kinds of ginger. These are mixed together slowly,\r\nexcept the pimento-grains, which are precipitated one by one to the\r\nbottom of the vessel by means of a small stick. Each grain produces a\r\nslight fermentation, and rises to the surface. It is then extracted, to\r\nbe plunged anew into the mixture, and this process is eight or nine\r\ntimes repeated; after which the mixture is complete. It appears that the\r\nUpas-antiar, taken internally, acts at first as a purgative, but\r\nafterwards its influence extends to the brain, and produces death with\r\nfrightful tetanic convulsions. Introduced into the blood through a\r\nwound, it kills small animals in a few moments, and men in a few hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Nipa fruticans. 2. Sugar Palm (_Areca saccharifera_).\r\n3. Ipo-Antiar (_Antiaris toxicaria_).]\r\n\r\nMarvel-loving writers formerly asserted that this deadly poison was\r\nemployed in the execution of criminals, who, however, received a pardon\r\nif they contrived to reach a tree, and bring back a supply of its venom.\r\nBirds, it was said, dropped dead while flying over it--as was formerly\r\ntold of the pestilential waters of the Dead Sea--and the whole country\r\naround was desolated by its noxious effluvia. But the fact is, the upas\r\ntree is merely a tree with poisonous secretions, and in no way affects\r\nthe atmosphere of the locality where it lives.\r\n\r\nA not less terrible poison is furnished by the Liana Tieuté (_Strychnos\r\ntieuté_), a member of the family _Loganiaceæ_. It has an exceedingly\r\nlong stem, but does not yield, like the upas, a whitish milky juice. Its\r\nvoluminous roots are covered with a thin reddish bark, of a peculiarly\r\nbitter taste. By boiling these roots the Javanese obtain the poisonous\r\nresin called in Malaysia _Upas tieuté_, and which was at one time\r\nsupposed to be identical with the essential element introduced by the\r\nIndians of South America into their famous _Ourari_ or _Wourali_. Sir\r\nRichard Schomburgk, however, has shown that the latter is obtained from\r\nthe _Strychnos toxifera_, a native of Guiana.\r\n\r\nThere are several other species of Strychnos; all with flattened,\r\ndisc-like, and silky seeds, surrounded by pulp. _S. nux vomica_, a\r\nmoderate-sized tree, with fruit much like an orange in appearance,\r\nfurnishes the valuable medicine and fatal poison--for it is both--called\r\n_Nux vomica_. The seeds have an intensely bitter taste, owing to the\r\npresence of two most virulent poisons, _Strychnia_ and _Brucia_; but the\r\npulp is innocuous, and greedily devoured by birds. _Strychnos\r\nColubrina_, a native of Malabar, furnished a variety of Snakewood, which\r\nin cases of bites by serpents is esteemed an infallible remedy. _S.\r\nPseudo-quina_, which flourishes in Brazil, yields a bark scarcely\r\ninferior in value as a tonic and a febrifuge to quinine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the abundance and variety of the epiphytous plants\r\nwhich grow profusely in the islands of the Indian Ocean. In Sumatra and\r\nin Borneo, the more venerable trees are clothed in a rich garment of\r\nlycopodiums and ferns, and these often glow with dazzling orchidaceous\r\nflowers, while by their side flourish strange aroidaceæ, with climbing\r\ncrawling stems, and aërial suckers. But of all these brilliant\r\nparasites, the most extraordinary, without doubt, is the _Rafflesia\r\nArnoldi_--a plant without any stem, which grows along the surface of the\r\nground upon the roots of the _lianas_, and principally of the _lissus_,\r\na species of vine peculiar to tropical countries. It was discovered by\r\nDr. Arnold, while in attendance upon Sir Stamford Raffles, Governor of\r\nJava. It produces only a fleshy flower, of a wine-like colour, with an\r\nintolerably disgusting odour; but it acquires extraordinary, and one\r\nmight say monstrous dimensions, for it seldom measures less than a yard\r\nin diameter, and its weight frequently exceeds four pounds.\r\n\r\nUpon the humid coasts of Borneo and Sumatra, the _Casuarinas_ mingle\r\ntheir weeping branches with those of the mangroves and fig-trees. Palms\r\nare common in these two great islands, as well as at Ceylon and at Java.\r\nI may mention among the most useful the _Nipa fruticans_ and the Sugar\r\nPalm (_Areca saccharifera_). The transformed leaves which accompany the\r\ninflorescence of the Nipa are brimful of a sugared and effervescent\r\nliquid, which is extracted by pressure, and converted into a palm wine\r\nof indifferent quality, consumed in great quantities in the Sunda\r\nArchipelago. A very sweet liquid, a species of syrup fit for the\r\nconfection of dainty sweetmeats, escapes from incisions made into the\r\nfloral envelopes of the _Areca saccharifera_. A tree-wax, analogous to\r\nthat of the _Croton sebiferum_, is furnished by the tree which the\r\nnatives of Borneo designate Pallagrar-Minjok (_Dipterocarpus\r\ntrinervis_). And, finally, it is at Borneo and at Sumatra we meet with\r\nthe _Dryobabanops camphora_, whence is procured a species of camphor\r\npreferred by the Chinese to that of the _Laurus camphora_; the _Urceola\r\nelastica_, whose milky sap indurates into a kind of caoutchouc, called\r\nSuitawan; and the _Isonandra-Percha_ (genus _Bassia butyracea_, family\r\nof the Sapotaceæ), which of recent years has become the staple of an\r\nextensive commerce. It is from this tree we obtain the valuable product\r\nof gutta-percha, which has received such various and ingenious\r\napplications, and is scarcely less useful in the arts than in the\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLORA OF THE EAST INDIAN ISLANDS:--\r\n\r\n1. Rafflesia Arnoldia.\r\n2. Niphobolus pubescens.\r\n3. Phalænopsis amabilis.\r\n4. Ærides suaveolens.\r\n5. Cycas circinnalis.\r\n6. Nepenthes distillatoria.\r\n7. Scindapsus pertusus.]\r\n\r\nJava is perhaps the most fertile of the Sunda Islands. Immense forests\r\nextend over its plains, and climb up its mountain-slopes to an elevation\r\nof upwards of 6500 feet. The damp localities are peopled with Clusiaceæ,\r\nand with other trees of thick soft trunks and branches. Mangroves and\r\nAvicennias thrive upon the littoral. The latter are specially noticeable\r\non account of their roots, which climb to a great distance above the\r\nmuddy soil, and throw off a number of suckers, not unlike gigantic\r\nwater-pipes (_asperges_). Among the palms most abundant at Java, I\r\nconfine myself to naming the Borrassus, the Corypha, and the Areca. The\r\nVaquois (a species of _Pandanus_), which in stature and appearance\r\nresemble the palms, are also widely diffused in that rich and fertile\r\nisland. In the forests of its interior swarm such splendid Ferns as the\r\n_Niphobolus pubescens_, and such graceful Archids as the _Aerides_\r\n_suaveolens_, with its far-shooting fronds and flowers, and the\r\n_Phalænopsis amabilis_. There, too, the traveller pauses before the\r\n_Cycas circinnalis_, whose trunk, upright and cylindrical as a Grecian\r\ncolumn, is surmounted by a crest of feathery leaves, each six to seven\r\nfeet in length, stiff, and cut into numerous strips, somewhat like our\r\nnative bracken; or he refreshes himself with the pure liquid which the\r\nwinding _Nepenthes distillatoria_, or Pitcher plant, collects in its\r\nhorn-shaped leaves, as a constant source of nutriment for its active\r\nlife; or, finally, he gazes wonderingly at the _Scindapsus pertusus_, an\r\nepiphytous plant, whose cartilaginous leaves are perforated with an\r\ninfinity of small circular holes, and which twines itself round the\r\ntallest forest-trees in an embrace as close as love's!\r\n\r\nThe forest-flora of the Moluccas differs but little from that of the\r\nSunda Islands. It presents, however, a few plants particularly\r\ncalculated to excite our interest. Thus, at Amboyna, the Sago-Palms,\r\nwith other trees of the same family, accumulate in immense woods,\r\nspreading over hundreds of acres. Everybody knows that the pith of this\r\npalm is a white farinaceous substance, called _sago_, which not only\r\nenters largely into the daily food of the natives, but forms an\r\nimportant item in the European bill of fare, at least for children and\r\ninvalids. Amboyna, moreover, is the classic land of spices. The air is\r\nthick with \"Sabæan odours.\" Every breeze comes laden with perfumes. The\r\nNutmeg (_Myristica aromatica_), the Clove (_Caryophyllus aromaticus_),\r\nand the Pepper-plants grow there in a wild state.\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines vegetation is singularly favoured by the humidity of\r\nthe climate and the elevation of the temperature, so that the Flora of\r\nthese richly-endowed islands displays a prodigious variety. Not a single\r\nfamily of tropical plants but is here represented by several species.\r\nHill and valley and plain alike are characterized by the exuberant\r\ngrowth of leaf and fruit and flower; the graceful forms might have\r\nenchanted an ancient Greek, the wealth of glowing and intense colour\r\nwould have fired the imagination of Turner, and defied the palette of\r\nTitian or Tintoretto. There are landscapes of such beauty and fertility\r\nas the fancy of artist or poet never conceived. Ferns and Orchids are,\r\nperhaps, even more abundant here than in the forests of Java, Borneo, or\r\nSumatra. The Bamboo attains to unusual proportions; the Areca (_Areca\r\ncatechu_) raises to the sky its tall shapely stem, crested with\r\nplume-like leaves; and the Betel-nut tree supplies in profusion the\r\ngrains which, mixed with the fruits of the gigantic palm, constitute the\r\n_Pinangue_; a kind of _quid_, which the Orientals chew delightedly, and\r\nto which they attribute very valuable stomachic and digestive\r\nproperties. Under the dense shade of the great forests we are amazed by\r\nuntold numbers of various kinds of plants, all adorned by richly\r\ncoloured leaves, which invest the scene with a singular charm, nay, with\r\nsomething of a fairy character; and amongst these we single out the\r\n_Dracæna terminalis_, with its blood-empurpled foliage, which, recently\r\nintroduced into Europe, has already become one of the greatest ornaments\r\nof our parks and gardens.\r\n\r\nI have previously had occasion to remark the singularity of character\r\nwhich in Australia distinguishes almost every member either of the\r\nvegetable or the animal kingdom. I have already said that this immense\r\nisland-continent seems to have been the chosen theatre for a distinct\r\ncreative display, where every type differs from the representatives of\r\nour scientific classifications in other parts of the globe. The reader\r\nhas been able to form some idea of the fancifulness of the vegetable\r\nforms peculiar to the Australian savannahs. Nor are those which\r\nconstitute the so-called forests less strangely fantastic. On the\r\nsouthern coast, which is the coolest, the forests are of very moderate\r\nextent. In fact, they may be more correctly described as enormous\r\nthickets scattered in tolerably sheltered localities. Most of the trees\r\nwhich compose them have trunks of great feebleness compared with their\r\nheight, which is often prodigious, and they do not begin to ramify until\r\nnear their summits. Their bark is smooth, and usually of a\r\ngrayish-white. Of all their species it can only be said that two--the\r\n_Stadmannia austral_ and the _Alectryon_--bear fruit which men can eat\r\neven under the pressure of hunger. Finally--and this without doubt is\r\nthe most singular feature of a truly exceptional vegetation--while all\r\nthe trees and herbaceous plants of the Old and New Worlds develop their\r\nleaves horizontally, or on a plane tangent to the cylindrical surface of\r\nthe trunk or stem, in Australia the leaves of the trees are disposed\r\nvertically; in such wise that they give scarcely any shade, and yet are\r\nthemselves exposed in the very slightest degree to the action of the\r\nsolar rays. It is owing to this latter circumstance they are always\r\nweakly coloured; and thus they give to the densest forests and the most\r\nrobust trees a sickly tint, a sort of pallor of disease, which saddens\r\nthe gaze accustomed to the varied tones and vivid hues of the verdure of\r\ntropical forests, or to the bold contrasts of light and shade exhibited\r\nby the woods of Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nThe Australian species are comprised in a small number of families,\r\nnotably in those of the Coniferæ and Myrtaceæ. Certain forests are\r\nwholly composed of Casuarinas; others, of Acacias; others again, of\r\nEucalypti. Some of the latter trees may be ranged among the greatest\r\nwith which botanists are acquainted. The Blue Gum (_Eucalyptus\r\nglobulus_) attains, for instance, the extraordinary stature of upwards\r\nof 300 feet, and does not send out a single branch until half this\r\ndistance from the ground. Its upright cylindrical trunk furnishes a\r\ntimber much appreciated by ship-wrights, and especially makes admirable\r\nmasts. The Eucalypti secrete in abundance a white, sugary, and aromatic\r\nsubstance; whence they derive their popular name of \"gum trees\"--a name\r\nwhich is also bestowed very frequently upon the gum-bearing Acacias.\r\n\r\nThe family of Coniferæ exhibit themselves in Australia, like every\r\nother group of plants, under strange and novel forms. The shape of those\r\ntrees is generally fusiform and pyramidal; their leaves are sometimes\r\nextraordinarily small, sometimes large and flattened. Many are of great\r\nsize; none, however, attaining the gigantic proportions of the\r\ncelebrated columnar Pine of New Caledonia, which Cook's companions\r\nmistook for a colossal mass of basaltic pillars, and which Moore, like a\r\ntrue son of industrious Albion, compared to an enormous factory-chimney.\r\nThis tree exceeds 160 feet in height, and its ramifications, all of the\r\nsame height, radiate regularly around its trunk, from the base even to\r\nthe summit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Ravenala Madagascariensis. 2. Heritiera argentea. 3.\r\nTanghin.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FOREST IN MADAGASCAR.]\r\n\r\nI have now to ask the reader's companionship on an excursion into the\r\nforests of the great African island of Madagascar. The insalubrity of\r\nthe climate and the jealous inhospitality of the inhabitants will not\r\npermit us to penetrate far into their luxuriant depths; but the most\r\nsuperficial glance will satisfy us upon their wild magnificence and the\r\noriginal variety of their superb flora.[167]\r\n\r\nWe should seek in vain among their leafy, blossoming glades, for the\r\nfamous Manchineal, a member of the American _Euphorbiaceæ_, which holds\r\na high place in the records of vegetable poisons; but the toxicological\r\namateur will find ample compensation in examining the formidable\r\nTanghin,[168] whose deadly juice, mixed with some other substances,\r\nplays an important part in the judicial ordeals popular among the\r\nMalagasy.\r\n\r\nThe Tanghin, or Tanguen (_T. venenifera_), is the only plant of its\r\ngenus, and is confined to Madagascar. It is described as a tree with\r\nsmooth alternate leaves of moderate thickness, clustered towards the\r\npoints of the branches, with large terminal cymes of flowers, having a\r\nsalver-shaped corolla, with rose-coloured lobes. The ovary is twofold,\r\nwith a long style and thick stigma; but usually only one attains to\r\nperfection, and forms an ellipsoid fruit, somewhat pointed at the ends,\r\ninvested in a smooth purplish-green skin, and containing a hard stone\r\nsurrounded by a thick fibrous pulp. The poisonous seed of the Tanghin is\r\nesteemed by the natives an infallible criterion of guilt or innocence.\r\nAfter being pounded, a small piece is swallowed by the supposed\r\ncriminal. If he be cursed with a strong stomach, which retains the\r\npoison, he speedily dies, and is held guilty; if his feeble digestion\r\nrejects it, he necessarily escapes, and his innocence is considered\r\nproven.\r\n\r\nBeneficent Nature has planted by the side of this fatal tree a species\r\nof infinite value, the _Ravenala Madagascariensis_, or \"Traveller's-Tree,\"\r\nwhich derives the latter designation from the base of the petiole of its\r\nlarge leaves, expanded and hollowed out into a kind of gutter, being\r\nconstantly filled with fresh water, and serving as a reservoir for the\r\nthirsty wayfarer. The Vacquois, or Vacoa (_Pandanus utilis_), one of\r\nthe Screw-Pines, is of much utility to the natives, who fabricate sacks\r\nand bags out of its tenacious leaves. The manufacture of these bags is a\r\nsource of comparative wealth for the poorer inhabitants of Madagascar,\r\nand to a still greater extent for those of Réunion and the Mauritius,\r\nwhence they are exported annually by millions.\r\n\r\nThe Malagasy forests also include several resinous species; among\r\nothers, the Copal-Tree, which furnishes the well-known gum used in\r\nEurope as a varnish; and the _Vahea_, a genus of Apocynaceæ, yielding\r\ncaoutchouc, which will hereafter figure largely in the exports from this\r\nmagnificent island. There are two species, namely, _Vahea\r\nMadagascariensis_--the \"Voua Héri\" of the natives--and _Vahea\r\ngummifera_. Numerous lianas, and a multitude of epiphytous plants,\r\nferns, and orchids, envelop and intertangle the trunks of the great\r\ntrees. I shall specify only the Beaded Liana (_Abrus precatorius_),\r\nwhose small hard fruits, rounded and of a scarlet red, make graceful\r\nwreaths and necklaces; the _Angræcum sesquipedale_ (an orchid), with\r\nbright irregular flowers; and the _Angræcum fragrans_, whose perfumed\r\nleaves supply a wholesome and savoury infusion. Finally, the _Heritiera\r\nargentea_, a tree about as large as our lindens, which certain botanists\r\nplace among the Byttneriaceæ, and others among the Sterculiaceæ, is\r\nnoticeable on account of its abundant foliage glittering silver-white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE LIFE IN THE FORESTS OF THE NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature, said Linné, is admirable above all in the smallest things:\r\n_Natura maxime miranda in minimis_. He might, perhaps, have more justly\r\nsaid, _Natura non minus miranda in minimis quam in maximis_: Nature is\r\nnot less wonderful in the least than in the greatest. Whether any\r\ncreated thing occupies a more or less considerable space, or contains a\r\ngreater or lesser quantity of matter, is of no importance to the\r\nnaturalist, who only studies the structure of the organs, the springs of\r\nlife, and the different forces which set them in motion; and considered\r\nfrom this point of view, a vibrio[169] and an elephant, a penicillium\r\nand a baobab, possess for him the same importance, the same amount of\r\ninterest. It would, however, be unjust not to recognize the fact that\r\nthere is something very legitimate in the kind of reverential admiration\r\nwhich every man is conscious of in the presence of those things that\r\nsymbolize, to a certain extent, power, strength, majesty, endurance--of\r\nthose that possess in a high degree the two valuable qualities of force\r\nand greatness. Coleridge tells us that we admire the cataract because it\r\nis the type of power. Probably our feelings for the oak are connected\r\nwith its emblematic properties of permanency, vigour, and durability.\r\nAll the logic of logicians, and all the sentiment of natural\r\nphilosophers, will never induce the mass of men to regard with the same\r\ninterest an ant and a lion, a tuft of moss and a forest of oaks, a grain\r\nof sand and an Alpine peak. I do not think, therefore, that I am\r\nstooping to a merely vulgar prejudice in signalling out to the reader,\r\namong the vegetables of the forests, those whose exceptional dimensions\r\nand venerable antiquity are for every traveller an object of\r\nastonishment and curiosity. The truth is, that from their contemplation\r\nwe derive a more vivid conception of Almighty Power than from the\r\nexamination of even the most wonderful microscopical mechanism. To the\r\nstill small voice of Nature our ears are deafened by the clash and clang\r\nof an ever-active world; but we cannot refuse to listen to the roar of\r\nthe ocean or the reverberation of the thunder. As we move swiftly onward\r\nin the press of the crowd and the race of life, we ignore the tiny blade\r\nand the delicate organism beneath our feet; but our eyes must perforce\r\nbe opened to the splendours of the sea, the undulating summits of\r\nsnow-crowned mountains, the sapphire vault of the starry heavens. Those\r\nthings realize to us, at once and with impressive force, the ubiquitous\r\nmajesty of the Divine Builder. And it is well that they should lift us\r\nfor a while above the materialism of our daily lives into a purer\r\natmosphere of thought and feeling--should bid us, while still lingering\r\nin the dusty track, expand our souls to hear\r\n\r\n    \"The mighty waters rolling evermore.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not only in tropical regions that we meet with the giants of the\r\nvegetable world. Europe possesses a few of them; isolated, it is true,\r\nbut comparable in their stature to the most robust denizens of the\r\nTorrid Zone: such are the chestnut-tree of Etna, and the plane of\r\nBoudjoukdéré, near Constantinople, of which so many travellers have\r\nspoken. The remains of the virgin forests of North America also abound\r\nin species analogous to our own, and capable of attaining, with an\r\nalmost incalculable longevity, truly extraordinary proportions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lofty table-lands of California (the Rocky Mountains) nourish an\r\nentire tribe of gigantic Coniferæ, frequently assembled in immense\r\nforests. The _Pinus Lambertiana_, the _Pinus Sabiniana_, and the _Pinus\r\ninsignis_, are not less than 160 to 180 feet in height; the _Douglas\r\nFir_ boasts of an almost equal stature, with a circumference which\r\nvaries from 18 to 36 feet. Yet these colossal trees are surpassed by the\r\n_Sequoia sempervirens_, which is 240 to 260 feet high, and by the Titan\r\nof Titans, the huge _Wellingtonia gigantea_, which is also a Sequoia. I\r\nshall mention a few individuals of the latter species, whose dimensions\r\nmay defy all comparison with the greatest trees of the Tropics.\r\n\r\nAccording to Müller, about ninety-four of these Coniferæ flourish on a\r\nplateau of the Sierra Nevada, at an altitude of 5400 feet. They are\r\ndistributed in small groups over a fertile soil. The gold-seekers have\r\nnamed one of them the \"Miner's Cabin.\" Its trunk, 320 feet in height,\r\npresents an excavation 16 feet in width. The \"Three Sisters\" are\r\nindividuals springing from one root; the \"Old Bachelor,\" stripped of its\r\nbranches by successive hurricanes, stands in solitary desolation; the\r\n\"Family\" consists of two aged trees around which four-and-twenty scions\r\nhave sprung up. The \"Riding-School\" is an enormous hollow trunk,\r\nprostrate on the ground, into which a man on horseback may enter as far\r\nas thirty yards. Another hollow trunk has been exhibited at San\r\nFrancisco, where they have constructed out of it a saloon, adorned with\r\ntapestry and furniture, capable of accommodating forty persons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     1. Large-leaved Magnolia. 2. Virginian Catalpa. 3. Pinus Sabiniana.]\r\n\r\nOther resinous trees of smaller dimensions grow in the more or less\r\nhumid localities of North America; such are the _Chamoecyparis\r\nChamæcyparis sphæroidea_, which does not exceed 80 feet in height, and\r\nthe Western _Thuya_ of pyramidal outline. Nor must I forget to name,\r\namong the Conifers of this continent, the Cypress of Louisiana, a tree\r\nof handsome appearance, about 100 feet high and 12 to 15 feet in\r\ncircumference, which lives, it is said, 5500 to 6000 years. Its leaves\r\nare shrunken like those of the larch; and from its roots, somewhat\r\ndeeply buried, spring several protuberances, or rounded conical\r\nexostoses, which sometimes grow to the height of three feet without\r\nbourgeoning.\r\n\r\nThe forests of the West and of the South which have hitherto escaped the\r\ntorch and the axe of the pioneer present to the traveller's admiring\r\ngaze those magnificent species described so eloquently by Chateaubriand\r\nand Cooper, and which are even less remarkable for their gigantic\r\nstature than for the majestic elegance of their port, the beauty of\r\ntheir foliage, and the dazzling splendour of their flowers. Some of\r\nthese forests are partly formed of Oaks whose leaves assume in autumn a\r\npurple tint, like the \"pupureum lumen\" of the Latin poet. In others the\r\ndominant trees are the Plane of the West, the Maple, the round-crested\r\nTulip, the large-leaved Catalpa, the Magnolia with white and scented\r\nblossoms. To their trunks clings a whole world of climbing, creeping,\r\nand parasitic plants; as the Virgin Vine, the Sumach, and the Virginian\r\nJasmine.\r\n\r\nMexico, as far as relates to its climate and productions, has been\r\ndivided into three distinctly marked regions, defined not by latitude,\r\nbut by the elevation of various portions of its territory. The upper\r\nregion, or Cold Lands, is that of the lofty mountains; the mean region,\r\nor Temperate Lands, that of the intermediate plateaus; the inferior\r\nregion, or Hot Lands, is that of the low plains, sometimes arid,\r\nsometimes marshy or wooded.\r\n\r\nThe arborescent Flora of the first two regions very nearly approximates\r\nto that of our northern countries; it principally consists of Pines,\r\nFirs, Oaks, and Arbute Trees. But in the Hot Lands the vegetation\r\ngenerally assumes, as we descend towards the south, all the\r\ncharacteristics of the tropical Flora. The feathery and graceful Palm\r\ntrees re-appear, mingled with Coryphas, Oreodoxas, Malpighiaceæ, and\r\nBignoniaceæ. There also grows the _Crescentia cujete_, or Calabash-tree,\r\nwhich is likewise found in the Antilles; it has a tortuous trunk, long\r\nbranches extended horizontally, and ovoid fruits, clothed with a hard\r\nwoody bark, which the Indians fabricate into vessels of divers forms,\r\npainting them in the liveliest colours.\r\n\r\nMexico is the country of the _Morus tinctoria_ and the _Hæmatoxylon\r\nCampechianum_. These two trees furnish the dye-wood which forms so\r\nimportant an article of commerce: the first, under the name of the\r\n\"yellow wood of Tampico\" or \"Tuspan;\" the second, under that of\r\n\"Campeachy wood.\" It is in the hottest and most humid parts of the\r\nsouthern provinces of this Republic that we meet, for the first time,\r\nwith one of the most precious trees of the Equinoctial Zone, the\r\nCacao-tree (_Theobroma cacao_), whose bruised and roasted seeds, mixed\r\nwith variable amounts of sugar and starch, form the different kinds of\r\nCocoa; or, sweetened and flavoured with vanilla or other substances, the\r\narticle known as Chocolate. It is but a small tree, with large entire\r\nleaves, and clustered flowers growing from the sides of the old stems\r\nand branches. Its large pentagonal fruits vary from six to ten inches in\r\nlength and three to five in breadth, and contain between fifty and a\r\nhundred seeds.\r\n\r\nThe _Vanilla planifolia_, another Mexican native, famous for its\r\nsucculent fruit, is a plant of the Orchidaceous order, which climbs\r\nabout other trees in the manner of ivy. It is the only genus of the\r\nfamily which possesses any economical value. The delicate perfume of its\r\nfruit is due to the presence of benzoic acid, which forms in crystals\r\nupon the pod, if left undisturbed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlready, in Central America, we encounter the first ranks, the vanguard,\r\nas it were, of those vast impenetrable forests which spread over the\r\nwhole northern region of South America to the banks of the Amazon, and\r\ncover with dense foliage immense areas in Guiana and Brazil. If we would\r\npause again to wonder at the Giants of the Vegetable Kingdom, we shall\r\nfind many well worthy of our consideration. Such, for example, is the\r\n_Bertholletia excelsa_, a colossal Lecythidacean on the borders of the\r\nOrinoco, whose large fruits are known in Europe as \"Brazil nuts,\" the\r\nseeds being enclosed in large woody vessels. The Sapucaya (_Lecythis\r\nollaria_) is scarcely less abundant, and of immense height. Its fruit,\r\npopularly called \"Monkey's Drinking-cups\" (Cuyas de Macaco), consists of\r\na cup-like vessel, with a circular hole at the top, in which a natural\r\nlid fits neatly. When the nuts are ripe this lid becomes loosened, and\r\nthe heavy cup falls with a crash, scattering the nuts over the ground.\r\n\r\n\"What attracted us chiefly,\" says a traveller in the virgin\r\nforests,[170] \"were the colossal trees. The general run had not\r\nremarkably thick stems; the great and uniform height to which they grow\r\nwithout emitting a branch, was a much more noticeable feature than their\r\nthickness; but at intervals of a furlong or so a veritable giant towered\r\nup. Only one of these monstrous trees can grow within a given space; it\r\nmonopolises the domain, and none but individuals of much inferior size\r\ncan find a footing near it. The cylindrical trunks of these larger trees\r\nwere generally 20 to 25 feet in circumference. Von Martius mentions\r\nhaving measured trees in the Parà district belonging to various species\r\n(Symphonia coccinea, Lecythis spirula, and Cratæva Tagia), which were 50\r\nto 60 feet in girth at the point where they become cylindrical. The\r\nheight of the vast column-like stems could not be less than 100 feet\r\nfrom the ground to their lowest branch. Mr. Leavens, at the saw-mills,\r\ntold me they frequently squared logs for sawing 100 feet long, of the\r\nPas d'Arco and the Massaranduba. The total height of these trees, stem\r\nand crown together, may be estimated at from 180 to 200 feet: where one\r\nof them stands, the vast dome of foliage rises above the other forest\r\ntrees as a domed cathedral does above the other buildings in a city.\r\n\r\n\"A very remarkable feature in these trees,\" says Mr. Bates, \"is the\r\ngrowth of buttressed-shaped projections around the lower part of their\r\nstems. The spaces between these buttresses, which are generally thin\r\nwalls of wood, form spacious chambers, and may be compared to stalls in\r\na stable: some of them are large enough to hold half-a-dozen persons.\r\nThe purpose of these structures is as obvious, at the first glance, as\r\nthat of the similar props of brickwork which support a high wall. They\r\nare not peculiar to one species, but are common to most of the larger\r\nforest trees. Their nature and manner of growth are explained when a\r\nseries of young trees of different ages is examined. It is then seen\r\nthat they are the roots which have raised themselves ridge-like out of\r\nthe earth; growing gradually upwards as the increasing height of the\r\ntree required augmented support. Thus they are plainly intended to\r\nsustain the massive crown and trunk in these crowded forests, whose\r\nlateral growth of the roots in the earth is rendered difficult by the\r\nmultitude of competitors.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely less remarkable, and certainly not less useful, than the\r\nTraveller's Tree of Madagascar is the Massaranduba, or Cow Tree, of\r\nthese grand Brazilian wildernesses. It is one of the largest of the\r\nforest monarchs, but rather reminds you of monarchy in its decay than of\r\nregal pomp, owing to its deeply-scored reddish and ragged back. A\r\ndecoction of this bark is used as a red dye for cloth. The copious\r\nmilk-like fluid which the tree supplies, and which may even be drawn\r\nfrom dry logs that have stood for days in the sun, is wholesome and\r\nnutritious, if taken in moderate quantities. On exposure to the air it\r\nsoon thickens into an excessively tenacious glue.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from these monstrous trees, the virgin forest possesses an\r\nabundance of interest for even the least observant traveller, while in\r\nits various phases it is adapted to astonish, to impress, and to awe a\r\nthoughtful mind. It is true that it does not boast of that profusion of\r\nfloral ornament, of those gay and exquisite buds and blossoms, which\r\nmake the charm of our English woods; but in its infinite variety of\r\nfoliage the grace of colour and beauty of form are ever present. What\r\nmost seizes upon the soul, however, is its intense silence--which the\r\noccasional scream of some wild animal, or the infrequent song of some\r\npensive bird, or the sudden crash of some over-toppling tree, does but\r\nrender the more significant and appalling. The hush is like that which\r\nprevails on a battle-field before the dread voices of the cannon speak\r\nof death and carnage, but, unlike that hush, it is never interrupted.\r\nMorning comes with its cold gray lights, noon with its warmth and\r\nradiance and splendour, night with its orbed moon and pearly dews, but\r\nthe hush still reigns undisturbed, and it seems to the traveller as if\r\nit would never be broken but by the sounds which shall proclaim the end\r\nof all things!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     1. Blechnum Brasiliense. 2. Alsophila horrida. 3. Panicum plicatum.\r\n     4. Marauta. 5. Caladium violaceum.]\r\n\r\nIt is rather by the varied characteristics of the species which compose\r\nit, by their fantastic structures and useful properties, than by its\r\ngigantic outcomes, that the wild flora of these forest-regions appeals\r\nto our admiration. We are struck at first by the infinite variety,\r\nrichness, and elegance of the vegetable forms. Especially do we pause in\r\nwonder before those glorious Tree-Ferns which I take to be the finest\r\ngrowth of the tropical wilderness. These Ferns, from 36 to 50 feet in\r\nheight, are not unlike Palms in their physiognomy; their stem is only\r\nless upright, shorter, and more scaly; their foliage, slightly dentated\r\non the edges, is more delicate, of a looser and more transparent\r\ntexture. To this family belong the _Blechnum Brasiliense_ and the\r\n_Alsophila horrida_. Not less attractive in appearance are the _Clusia\r\nrosea_ or the _Carolinea insignis_. The former of these trees belong to\r\na family (that of the Clusiaceæ) nearly all whose representatives throw\r\noff from every point of their branches long aerial roots. The traveller\r\nreposes with a feeling of Sybaritic delight under its thick and\r\nevergreen foliage, enriched with brilliant flowers. The second, with its\r\nshrunken leaves, owes the specific epithet (_insignis_, \"remarkable\")\r\nwhich botanists have imposed upon it, to the peculiar structure of its\r\nflowers. The latter bear in the centre of their chalice a great number\r\nof stamens, which form a silken tuft of the most graceful design.\r\n\r\nThe Gramineæ, like the Ferns,--to use an expression of\r\nHumboldt's,--\"ennoble themselves\" under the Tropics: witness the Bamboo,\r\nthe Sugar-Cane, the Sorgho, and the great Panicums. Of the latter genus\r\nwe have already seen in Africa numerous species. America in its turn\r\noffers to our attention the _Panicum maximum_ and _plicatum_,\r\nwood-inhabiting Gramineæ, which without attaining to the dimensions of\r\nthe bamboo, or even to that of the cane, far surpass that of their\r\nEuropean congener, the millet.\r\n\r\nThe graceful palms abound in South America. The greatest of all, the\r\nCocoa-tree, seems there to have discovered its true home, for it nowhere\r\nelse acquires a greater development. There, too, the Banana flourishes\r\nmarvellously, no less than the Cocoa-tree, in a wild state, and, like\r\nthe latter, is carefully cultivated on account of its nourishing and\r\nsavoury fruits. A multitude of lianas and epiphytous plants twine round\r\nthe trunks and branches of the trees, and frequently choke up their\r\nfailing life. Some are indigenous to all tropical countries: the\r\n_Calamus Rotang_, for example; others are more particularly, or even\r\nexclusively, proper to the New World.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     1. Banana. 2. Carolinea insignis. 3. Clusia rosea.]\r\n\r\nThe family of Aroideæ is there represented by the _Pothos_, whose fleshy\r\nand herbaceous stems are surmounted by leaves sometimes arrow-headed,\r\nsometimes digitate or elongated, and always divided by thick cord-like\r\nnerves. We know that the Aroideæ alone possess, in the vegetable\r\nkingdom, the property of disengaging, while flowering, a heat\r\nappreciable by the thermometer. To this family belong the _Caladiums_, a\r\ngenus closely allied to the Pothos. With these lianas mingle the\r\nbranching stems of the Passifloræ, or Passion-Flowers, so named because\r\nPierre de Ceza, in his \"Histoire du Pérou,\" asserted that he had\r\nrecognized in the fantastic flowers of this genus of plants all the\r\ninstruments of our Saviour's Passion--an idea which could only have been\r\nconceived by an imaginative and credulous Spaniard. Elsewhere the\r\nBignonias open by hundreds their large and richly-coloured flowers; the\r\nBauhinias stretch along the trees their long leafless branches, often 40\r\nto 45 feet in length, which sometimes hang vertically from the lofty\r\nsummits of the Swietenias, or Mahogany trees, and sometimes extend\r\nobliquely from one huge trunk to another, like the ropes of a ship. The\r\nTiger-Cats, says Humboldt, display a wonderful agility in mounting or\r\ndescending these graceful vegetable shrouds.\r\n\r\nUpon the umbrageous banks of the Rio Magdalena grows a creeping\r\n_Aristolochus_, whose flowers in their extraordinary development surpass\r\nthose of the _Rafflesia Arnoldi_, measuring often three feet and a half\r\nin circumference. The forests of which we are now speaking also nourish\r\nnumerous species of Convolvulus; I may particularize the _Convolvulus\r\nbatatas_, a climbing plant, whose roots produce the feculent and\r\nsaccharine tubercules known over the wide world by the name of\r\n\"Patates,\" and frequently but erroneously confounded with that most\r\nuseful vegetable, the Potato. The root of another Convolvulus, a native\r\nof Mexico, constitutes the _Jalap officinalis_, which figures in the\r\nveterinary pharmacopoeia as an important purgative.\r\n\r\nCertain lianas, common enough in the South American forests, belong to\r\nthe family of _Sapindaceæ_, which, like the orders Loganiceæ and\r\nEuphorbiaceæ, owe their reputation chiefly to the medicinal or poisonous\r\nsubstances extracted from them. Among the Sapindaceæ I shall mention\r\nonly the genus _Paullinia_, which includes several species endowed with\r\nnarcotic properties. These properties appear especially developed in the\r\n_Paullinia pinnata_. Its bark, leaves, and fruit contain an abundant\r\nacrid principle with which the Indians of Brazil prepare a slow but\r\ncertain poison. The Indians of Guiana extract from the _Paullinia\r\ncururu_ another substance with which they envenom their arrows, and\r\nwhich was long supposed to be the veritable _Wourali_. But Sir Richard\r\nSchomburgk has shown that the latter formidable poison is really\r\nextracted, as I have already recorded, from the _Strychnos toxifera_, a\r\nshrub of the family _Loganiaceæ_, which flourishes in Guiana and Brazil.\r\nTo the same family and the same countries belong the _Ignatia amara_,\r\nwhose seeds are known by the name of \"St. Ignatius' Beans.\" These beans\r\ncontain two alkaloids, _Strychnine_ and _Brucine_, which we also extract\r\nfrom the _Nux vomica_, and which must be classed among the most violent\r\npoisons known to the toxicologist.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of the poisonous plants of South America, a few words in\r\nreference to the Manchineal (_Hippomane Mancenilla_) will not be\r\ninappropriate. This tree thrives best, it is said, on the sea-shore. It\r\nbears a profusion of very pretty fruit, resembling in colour and form\r\nthe Red Apple (the Spanish _Manzanilla_), and exhaling an agreeable,\r\nlemon-like odour. They are, therefore, scarcely less beguiling than Dead\r\nSea fruits; but they are also very poisonous, yet less deadly than the\r\nmilky juice which flows from the slightest incision made in the tree's\r\nthick and grayish bark. This juice, received into the stomach, or\r\nintroduced into the blood through a wound, slays the victim with awful\r\nquickness. If it do but touch the skin, it excites a violent irritation,\r\nand raises swellings or boils of the worst description. The very vapour\r\nwhich it emits causes a painful itching in the eyes, the lips, and the\r\nnostrils. It was formerly asserted that to sleep under the shade of a\r\nManchineal tree was certain death; but the naturalist Jacquin, in the\r\ninterests of science, courageously made the experiment, and proved the\r\nfalsity of the story.\r\n\r\nThe Manchineal is not unfrequently confounded with other poisonous\r\nEuphorbiaceæ, as the _Sapium aucuparium_ and the _Excoecaria\r\nagallochia_, which flourish in very nearly the same regions. The\r\n_Excoecaria_, it is said, is not less dangerous than the Manchineal.\r\nIt owes its name (_ex_, and _coecus_, \"blind\") to the circumstance (or\r\nthe fable) that some European sailors, while felling wood in the forest,\r\nhaving accidentally struck with their axe a tree of this species, were\r\nblinded by the milky juice which sprang into their eyes.\r\n\r\nBy a kind of compensation, the Tropical Forests, which contain so many\r\npoisonous plants, produce also a great number of the highest utility to\r\nman. Some offer him efficient remedies against the diseases which beset\r\nhis frame; others nourish him with the fecula of their roots or the\r\ndelicious substance of their fruits; others again supply him with\r\ntextile fibres, dyeing or resinous materials, and woods which the artist\r\nand the artisan convert to numerous uses. This vegetable wealth has been\r\nwidely distributed over South America. It will suffice to indicate a few\r\nof its more notable sources.\r\n\r\nIf we direct our attention to medicinal plants, we shall probably find\r\nnone more precious than the Quinquina, whose bark is the most effective\r\nof all febrifuges, and which is endowed, moreover, with very valuable\r\ntonic and depuratory properties. Sir Samuel Baker, in his recent address\r\nto the British Association at Dundee, pronounced it the traveller's best\r\nfriend, the powerful weapon with which he could securely enter the\r\nAfrican wilderness, and successfully contend against its demon-host of\r\nfevers and agues. The Quinquinas (genus, _Cinchona_; family, _Rubiaceæ_)\r\nare trees or evergreen shrubs with large and handsome leaves, and\r\nflowers whose form and fragrance remind one of the lilac. They are\r\ndiffused over the two slopes, but chiefly along the eastern slope, of\r\nthe Andean Cordilleras, in the republics of Venezuela, New Granada,\r\nEcuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The traveller meets them occasionally in\r\npicturesque groups or thickets which the Peruvians call _Manchas_\r\n(spots); but they are more frequently scattered in immense forests.\r\n\r\nWhat of the lactiferous and resinous plants? South America is the native\r\nland of the trees whence we extract the resinous gums called \"Animé\r\nd'Amérique,\" \"White Amber,\" and \"Soft Brazilian Copal,\" and the \"Hevea\r\nGuyanensis,\" which furnishes the greater portion of the caoutchouc\r\nimported into Europe.\r\n\r\nCaoutchouc was described for the first time in 1736, by the scientific\r\ntravellers Bouguer and La Condamine, members of a Commission despatched\r\nto Peru by the Parisian \"Académie des Sciences,\" to measure an arc of\r\nthe meridian. A few years later, the engineer Fresneau, who resided for\r\na long time in Guiana, collected, with the assistance of a native, ample\r\ninformation in reference to caoutchouc and the tree which produced it.\r\nFinally, in 1768, was found in a work by the traveller Aublet on the\r\nFlora of Guiana, the description and figure of the _Hevea_. This tree\r\nattains a height of 50 to 70 feet. The almond enclosed in the kernels of\r\nits fruits is white, of a very agreeable taste, and much esteemed by the\r\nIndians, who also extract from it an oil for seasoning their food.\r\n\r\nThe Banana, the American Agave, the Bamboo, and divers Palm-trees supply\r\nthe inhabitants of South America with suitable materials for the\r\nfabrication of various tissues, from the finest and most brilliant linen\r\ncloth to the rude mats which ornament the cabin of the savage. Trees\r\nbearing fruits or edible roots are innumerable. To the Bananas and\r\nCocoa-trees which I have already mentioned, we may add, as the most\r\nuseful, the Maranteas or Canneas, especially the _Maranta arundinacea_,\r\n_M. alloya_, and _M. nobilis_, whose roots, rasped and washed,\r\nconstitute the popular and valuable farina so widely known as\r\n_Arrow-root_; the Guavas (_Psidium pyriferum_, and _P. pomiferum_),\r\nwhose gilded fruits contain a succulent and perfumed pulp; the Papaw\r\ntree (_Carica papaya_), resembling the Palm in its port and aspect, and\r\nalso loaded with large yellowish fruit, whose flesh is exceedingly\r\nsavoury and aromatic. The Papaw, moreover, enjoys some extremely\r\nremarkable properties; thus, its milky juice exhales, when burnt, an\r\nammoniacal odour, and chemical analysis has recognized therein the\r\npresence of _fibrine_. Mix some of this juice in water, plunge into the\r\nmixture fresh hard meat, and in a few moments it will become exquisitely\r\ntender. The very exhalations of the tree operate in the same manner, and\r\nthe inhabitants of the regions where it flourishes suspend to its\r\nbranches such meat and poultry as they wish to soften.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLORA OF THE NEW WORLD.\r\n\r\n1. Papaw Tree (_Papaya Sativa_)\r\n2. Great American Cocoa-Nut Tree.\r\n3. Mangrove (_Rhizophora mangle_).]\r\n\r\nThe immense forests of Brazil and Guiana are for the whole world an\r\ninexhaustible storehouse of woods for dyeing and cabinet work. They\r\nspread their dense masses of foliage along the borders of the sea, where\r\nthe Mangroves (_Rhizophora mangle_) plunge their adventitious roots into\r\nthe mud inundated by the surging tides of those regions, and form a kind\r\nof impenetrable palisade, behind which grow in infinite variety trees of\r\nthe costliest timber. Such are the _Swieteniæ_, or Mahogany trees;\r\nthe _Ferolia Guyanensis_, which supplies the well-known rose or satin\r\nwood; the _Jacaranda Brasiliensis_, and the _Dalbergia_, which yield the\r\nviolet ebony; the _Sterculia acuminata_, whose flowers exhale a foetid\r\nodour, and whose timber, called \"stinkwood,\" is nevertheless held in\r\nhigh esteem on account of its durability, the fineness of its texture,\r\nand the excellent polish of which it is susceptible. Nor must we forget\r\nthe _Cæsalpineæ_, whose woods are impregnated with a red colouring\r\nmatter which varies in tint according to the species, and which are\r\nlargely employed by the dyer under the names of \"Brazil wood\" and\r\n\"Pernambuco wood.\" A great number of other woods which we procure from\r\nthese countries, and which are in daily use in cabinet work, toys,\r\nmarquetry, and dyeing, belong to vegetable species as yet undetermined.\r\nWe might, however, almost venture to assert that whatever tree you\r\naccidentally and at haphazard struck down in these forests, either its\r\ntimber, bark, or roots would be found capable of being utilized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have not mentioned, among the species proper to the Forests of the New\r\nWorld, those which are common with our own, and which abound upon\r\nelevated lands. The extraordinary height to which not only isolated\r\nmountains, but whole districts rise, in the vicinity of the Equator, and\r\nthe low temperature which is the consequence of this elevation, provide\r\nthe inhabitant of the Torrid Zone with a remarkable spectacle. For\r\nwhile, as Humboldt remarks, he may look around him upon groves of palms\r\nand bananas, he also sees those vegetable forms which are regarded as\r\nmore particularly belonging to the countries of the North. Cypresses,\r\nfirs, and oaks, barberries and alders, closely resembling our own, cover\r\nthe table-lands of Southern Mexico and that part of the Andes which the\r\nEquator traverses. Thus Nature allows the denizen of the Torrid Zone to\r\nsee, without quitting his native land, all the vegetable forms of the\r\nearth, at the same time that from one pole to the other the entire vault\r\nof heaven reveals to his gaze its luminous worlds.\r\n\r\nI conclude my account of the South American Forests with a picture\r\ntaken from the interesting volume of Mr. Bates, and drawn on the bank of\r\na forest stream flowing into the Murncupé. \"A glorious vegetation,\" he\r\nsays, \"piled up to an immense height, clothes the banks of the creek,\r\nwhich traverses a broad tract of semi-cultivated ground, and the varied\r\nmasses of greenery are lighted up with the sunny glow. Open\r\npalm-thatched huts peep forth at intervals from amidst groves of banana,\r\nmango, cotton, and papaw trees and palms. Both banks are masked by lofty\r\nwalls of green drapery, here and there a break occurring. The projecting\r\nboughs of the trees are hung with natural garlands and festoons, and an\r\nendless variety of creeping plants clothe the water frontage, some of\r\nwhich, especially the Bignonias, are ornamented with large,\r\ngaily-coloured flowers. Art could not have assorted together beautiful\r\nvegetable forms so harmoniously as is here done by Nature. Palms, as\r\nusual, form a large proportion of the lower trees; some of them,\r\nhowever, shoot up their slim stems to a height of sixty feet or more,\r\nand wave their branches of nodding plumes between you and the sky. One\r\nkind of palm, the Pashiúba (_Iriartea Exorhiza_), which grows here in\r\ngreater abundance than elsewhere, is especially attractive. It is not\r\none of the tallest kinds, for when full-grown its height is not more,\r\nperhaps, than forty feet; the leaves are somewhat less drooping, and the\r\nleaflets much broader than in other species, so that they have not that\r\nfeathery appearance which those of some palms have, but still they\r\npossess their own peculiar beauty.\"\r\n\r\nProbably there is no richer field on earth for the naturalist, the poet,\r\nor the artist than the virgin forest;--\r\n\r\n    \"To mark the structure of a plant or tree,\r\n     And all fair things of earth, how fair they be!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE TROPICAL FORESTS:--THE ELEPHANT--THE RHINOCEROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome thousands of years ago--no long period in the history of creation,\r\nthough so far outstripping the written records of man--gigantic animals,\r\nwith huge trunks and ivory tusks, forming the family of Proboscideæ,\r\nwere distributed throughout all the northern regions of Europe, Asia,\r\nand America.\r\n\r\nOf this family the most ancient and colossal representative is the\r\n_Dinotherium_, which appears to have flourished in the Miocene period of\r\nthe Tertiary epoch, and a skull of which was disinterred at Eppelsheim,\r\nin Hesse Darmstadt, in 1836, measuring about four feet in length and\r\nthree in breadth; whence Cuvier inferred that the total length of the\r\nanimal was probably eighteen feet. This pachyderm, which far surpassed\r\nin size the largest living elephant, had a comparatively short trunk,\r\nand tusks inserted in front of the lower jaw. Such a lower jaw could\r\nhardly have been otherwise than cumbrous and inconvenient to the\r\nquadruped if he lived on land. No such disadvantage, as Dr. Buckland\r\nremarks,[171] would have attended this structure in a large animal\r\ndestined to live in water; and the aquatic habits of the family of\r\nTapirs, to which the Dinotherium was most nearly allied, render it\r\nprobable that, like them, it was an inhabitant of fresh-water lakes and\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nTwo other kinds of Proboscidians, the _Mastodon_ and the _Mammoth_,\r\nbelong to the Pleiocene period, the last of the Tertiary epoch, and to\r\nthe Intermediate or Glacial deposits, which immediately preceded the\r\nmodern epoch. The Mastodon only differed essentially from the Elephant\r\nin his dental apparatus. His molar teeth were covered with conical\r\nprojections, whence his name; he had two small tusks, planted in the\r\nlower jaw like those of the Dinotherium, but bent forward, and two\r\nothers in the upper jaw, having the same direction, but being of a\r\nprodigious length. Buffon named it the \"Animal of the Ohio,\" because its\r\nfossil remains were discovered on the banks of that great river. They\r\nhave also been found in other parts of North America, and particularly\r\nin the saline morass known as Big-bone Lick, in the northern districts\r\nof Kentucky. Several skeletons, almost perfect, have been excavated at a\r\nmoderate depth, and some of them in a vertical position, as if the\r\nanimals had been stricken with death while standing, and suddenly\r\nengulfed in the mud.\r\n\r\nMany curious fables are told by the Indians in reference to this extinct\r\nquadruped. The Shawnee Indians believe that contemporary with them lived\r\na race of men of proportionate dimensions, and that the Great Being\r\ndestroyed both the one and the other with thunderbolts. Those of\r\nVirginia state that the \"Great Man on High\" slew this colossal genus,\r\nbecause it was exterminating the animals created for the use of man, and\r\nthat none escaped but the hugest bull, who, having been wounded by the\r\ncelestial bolts, fled towards the great lakes, in whose solitudes he\r\nwanders to this very day. The Indians of Canada and Louisiana designate\r\nthe Mastodon by the name of \"Father of the Bulls,\" probably on account\r\nof the bones of cattle disinterred with his own.\r\n\r\nThe Mammoth (_Elephas primigenius_) is known to us only by the fossil\r\nremains which have been discovered embedded in the glacial deposits of\r\nthe Intermediate epoch. The first discovery took place in 1799, under\r\ncircumstances which are thus recorded in the _Zoologist_.\r\n\r\nIn 1799, a Tungusian fisherman observed, in a bank on the shore of the\r\nFrozen Ocean, at the mouth of the river Lena, a shapeless mass almost\r\nenveloped in ice, and he was quite unable to determine what it might be.\r\nIn the following year a larger portion of this mass became visible, but\r\nthe fisherman was still unable to discover its nature. Towards the end\r\nof the following summer, however, one of the tusks and an entire side of\r\na fossilized animal were exposed. But it was not until the fifth year\r\nfrom its discovery, when the ice had melted sooner than usual, that the\r\nenormous animal became entirely detached from the bank or cliff in which\r\nit was first observed, and came thundering down upon a sand-bank below.\r\nIn the month of March 1804, the fisherman extracted the tusks, which\r\nwere nine feet six inches long, and together weighed 360 pounds, and\r\nsold them at Yakoutsk for fifty roubles. Two years afterwards, Mr.\r\nAdams, a traveller, visited the animal, and found it much mutilated. The\r\nYakoutes residing in the neighbourhood had cut away the flesh to feed\r\ntheir dogs; wild beasts had also eaten a great quantity of it.\r\nNevertheless, with the exception of a fore-leg, the skeleton was entire;\r\nthe other bones being still held together by ligaments and portions of\r\nskin. The head was covered with dried skin; one of the ears was entire,\r\nand furnished with a tuft of hairs; the pupil of the eye was still to be\r\ndistinguished; the brain was in the skull, but somewhat dried; the lower\r\nlip had been gnawed by animals, the upper one was entirely gone, and the\r\nteeth were consequently exposed; the neck was furnished with a long\r\nmane; the skin was covered with long hair and a reddish wool; the\r\nportion of skin still remaining was so heavy that two men could scarcely\r\ncarry it; according to Mr. Adams, more than thirty pounds' weight of\r\nhair and wool was collected from the wet sand into which it had been\r\ntrodden by the white bears while devouring the flesh. This skeleton is\r\nnow preserved in the Museum of the Academy of St. Petersburg. The height\r\nof the creature is about nine feet, and its extreme length to the tip of\r\nthe tail about sixteen feet.\r\n\r\nA second carcass was afterwards discovered on the bank of the Asaleïa,\r\nwhich empties its waters into the Frozen Sea, by the traveller\r\nSarytcheff. It was standing upright, and wholly covered with its skin\r\nand fur. Finally, a third has been recently found in the same region,\r\nand the Museum at Paris possesses a portion of its skin, with a tuft of\r\nwool, and some relics of the mane.\r\n\r\nThe Mammoth, therefore, would seem to be a link connecting the past and\r\nthe present worlds, a being whose body has outlived its destination.\r\nEvidently it was adapted to brave the winters of a boreal clime; its\r\nlong, warm, and woolly coat forming an admirable defence against the\r\nseverest cold. It probably inhabited the icy plains, and the banks of\r\nthe lakes and rivers; its food consisting of lichens, reeds, and the\r\nyoung shoots of the willows and other trees which thrive in moist\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nThe Mammoth naturally leads us to an examination of his descendant and\r\ncongener, the Elephant; the largest and strongest, the most sagacious\r\nand docile of all living animals.\r\n\r\nElephants, of which only two species at present exist, the Asiatic and\r\nAfrican, are natives of tropical regions, where they prefer to inhabit\r\nthe depths of the forests, quitting their umbrageous recesses only at\r\nnight, in search of food, or to quench their thirst in the nearest\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThe whole form of the animal suggests the idea of unwieldy strength. His\r\nhead is large, with extremely small eyes, and very large and pendulous\r\nears; he has an arched back, and a huge thick body, which rests upon\r\nclumsy and shapeless legs; his feet are slightly divided into five\r\nrounded heaps; the upper jaw is armed with two enormous projecting\r\ntusks, which measure in many instances six or seven feet; and he is\r\nendowed with an extraordinary proboscis or trunk, of such strength that\r\nit can uproot trees, and of such delicacy that it can gather grass. This\r\norgan, nearly eight feet in length, conveys the food to the mouth, and\r\npumps up the enormous draughts of water, which by its recurvature are\r\nturned into and driven down the capacious throat, or showered over the\r\nbody. Its length supplies the place of a long neck, which would have\r\nbeen incompatible with the support of the large head and weighty tusks.\r\nA glance at the head will show the thickness and strength of the trunk\r\nat its insertion; and the massy arched bones of the face and thick\r\nmasculine neck, are wonderfully adapted for supporting and working this\r\npowerful and marvellous instrument.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic Elephant (_Elephas maximus_ of Linné, _Elephas Indicus_ of\r\nCuvier) has small ears and tusks. A head elongated in height, and\r\nterminating in a kind of double pyramid. His hide is a clear brown\r\ncolour. This species includes several varieties; that of Indo-China is\r\nremarkable for its prodigious height, which sometimes attains fifteen\r\nfeet, and for a skin marked with brown spots upon a clear gray ground.\r\nThe islands of the Indian Archipelago likewise contain several varieties\r\nof elephants, which experts can easily distinguish from one another. In\r\nevery species are found the _albinos_, or white elephants, which receive\r\nthe marked veneration of every Indian race, and particularly of those of\r\nSiam and Pegu.\r\n\r\nThe African Elephant (_Elephas Africanus_) differs from the preceding in\r\nthe structure of his grinder teeth, in the length of his tusks, which\r\nare enormous, and in his ears, whose trumpet is also of great\r\ndimensions. He was formerly met with throughout all the African\r\ncontinent, and was much employed in war by the Carthaginians and\r\nEgyptians. From the northern regions of Africa he has now disappeared,\r\nbut large herds still haunt the whole southern division, from the\r\nSenegal to the Cape, and the eastern districts, as far north as\r\nAbyssinia. He is also found in all the African interior, whose\r\ninhabitants deal in ivory as the staple of their commerce. His height is\r\nequal to that of the Asiatic elephant, and the habits of the two species\r\nare identical.\r\n\r\nElephants live in the forests, gathering in troops of from thirty to\r\nabout one hundred individuals, and as they require a very extensive area\r\nof pasturage, it is said that they pitilessly expel from their domains\r\nall other animals which trespass therein to share the product.\r\n\r\nEach herd marches under the guidance of an acknowledged chief. When they\r\nsally forth from their retreats to devastate a field, or to wander in\r\nquest of fresh pastures, they observe a very regular order of march; the\r\nyoung and the females occupying the centre, the males assemble round\r\nthem in a circle. If danger threatens, the little ones take refuge under\r\nthe breast of their mothers, who fold their trunks about them.\r\n\r\nThe young elephant is suckled for two years, and during that period\r\nattains the stature of four feet and a half. At the end of the third\r\nyear he is nearly six feet high. He continues to grow, but less rapidly,\r\nuntil twenty-two or twenty-four years old. The female adults measure\r\ngenerally from seven to nine feet in height, and the males from ten feet\r\nand a half to twelve. As may be inferred from the tardiness of his\r\ngrowth, the elephant enjoys the privilege of longevity. He has been\r\nknown to live in captivity to the age of 120 or 130 years; but Cuvier\r\nwas of opinion that in his free and wild condition he might well number\r\nnearly a couple of centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Africans hunt the elephant for the sake of his ivory and flesh; in\r\nIndia, and the isles of the Indian Ocean, to reduce them to subjection.\r\nIn Africa, for many negro populations, ivory and \"ebony wood\" (an\r\neuphuism by which the slave-dealers designate their black slaves) are\r\nthe sole articles of commerce, and the majority of the English, Dutch,\r\nand French colonists carry on a considerable traffic in elephants'\r\nteeth. The negroes excavate wide pits which they cover over with\r\nbranches; and the elephants falling into them are precipitated headlong\r\nupon sharpened stakes; or they kill them either with arrows, assegays,\r\nor musketry. Hunting them with spears is truly a ferocious pastime. The\r\npoor elephant only succumbs after receiving so great a number of\r\nprojectiles that his body resembles an enormous porcupine. He rarely\r\nturns upon his aggressors; he seeks to fly; he fills the air with\r\nplaintive wailings; the female throws her huge bulk between her young\r\nones and the enemy; the male sometimes rushes furiously upon his\r\nassailants, and woe to the latter if he overtake them; he crushes them\r\nunder his hoofs, he pierces them with his tusks, or seizes them with his\r\ntrunk, and dashes them upon the earth a shapeless and bleeding mass. But\r\nnimble and experienced hunters easily elude his charge, whose onset he\r\nis prevented from moderating by his weight, or from rapidly changing its\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNTING THE ELEPHANT IN AFRICA.]\r\n\r\nBut firearms, and especially the recently perfected rifles, are\r\nassuredly the best weapons to employ against the leviathan. With a\r\nWestley-Richards, for instance, a good marksman, aiming at the\r\nshoulder-joint or the ear, is certain to bring down his game; he may\r\npost himself at a distance, and avoid exposure, while the victim is\r\nsaved from a cruel agony.\r\n\r\nIvory is not the only valuable product which the elephant yields; his\r\nhide, very thick and very tenacious, can be utilized for many purposes.\r\nThe bucklers made of it by the negroes are scarcely less precious than\r\nthe shield of Ajax, which was formed of a bull's hide sevenfold. The\r\nanimal's flesh is also eaten, although too tough and too strongly\r\nflavoured for an European palate.\r\n\r\nIn India and the Indian islands the chase is carried on to make\r\nprisoners, and not victims. Its most remarkable feature is the important\r\nand almost indispensable assistance which the tame elephants render man\r\nagainst their wild brethren, zealously aiding to reduce them into\r\nslavery; now serving as baits to beguile and attract, and now as\r\ngendarmes, or rather as convict-warders, to compel their obedience. In\r\nCeylon, elephant-hunting is almost an affair of State; it is like a\r\nnational war, in which the Government appeals to the goodwill of the\r\npopulation generally, both Europeans and natives.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it is known that a troop or _horde_ of elephants has\r\nassembled in a forest, the natives set to work, and with trunks of trees\r\nfixed in the ground and supported by transversal bars and buttresses,\r\nconstruct a vast palisaded enclosure, or _corral_, whose entrance forms\r\na kind of gullet so narrow that the animals can only enter one by one,\r\nand once drawn into it are unable to return. This being accomplished, a\r\nthousand men, Europeans or Cingalese, surround the forest; they enclose\r\nthe herd in a circle which incessantly contracts, and drive them before\r\nthem by waving their torches, and keeping up a grand _tintamarre_ of\r\ntamtams, trumpets, and musket-shots. The frightened animals can find no\r\nother avenue of escape than the entrance to the corral, where are\r\nplaced, moreover, as an attraction, some females trained to act as\r\ndecoys.\r\n\r\nWhen all, or nearly all the herd, has been driven into the enclosure,\r\nthe entrance is strongly and firmly closed with ropes and beams. The\r\nelephants, perceiving themselves caught in a trap, naturally endeavour\r\nto effect their escape by the way they entered. A sufficient number of\r\nhunters then place themselves along each side of the avenue, and a few,\r\nmounted on the decoys, are stationed at its extremity. The moment that\r\none of the captives has got entangled in it, his retreat is cut off by\r\nmeans of thick planks piled across the palisade, and he is allowed to\r\nmake his way towards the entrance, which is also blocked up. There he\r\nencounters the decoys, which force him, by striking him with their\r\ntrunks, to fall back against a neighbouring tree, to which he is\r\nspeedily bound with ropes. This first operation accomplished, the\r\nfemales are led back to the corral, and the game is renewed, until all\r\nthe animals have undergone the same fate, and each of them is thralled\r\nto a tree in the forest. Nothing now remains but to accustom them to a\r\nlife of servitude; and this is done by depriving them of food for a\r\nshort time, then administering it in small quantities, and proceeding\r\nfrom the articles they like the least to those they prize the most. The\r\nprivation at first enfeebles them, and consequently calms their\r\nirritation, while they feel the greater gratitude afterwards for the\r\nalleviation which is so readily afforded them. This gratitude, and,\r\nstill more, the dependance in which they find themselves upon man, who\r\nat his supreme pleasure grants or refuses their food, renders them in a\r\nfew days docile and tractable. Thus their docility, and the important\r\nservices which they render, mainly arise in the overmastering fear which\r\nman inspires in them.\r\n\r\n\"It is remarkable,\" says Boitard, \"that the elephant is not and never\r\nhas been a domestic animal, but a captive who only obeys through terror.\r\nHowever tame he may be, he never fails to escape into the woods to\r\nresume his savage life if an opportunity arises. The need, therefore,\r\narises that on a long march he shall have his driver, or _mahoud_, on\r\nhis back, to guide him, threaten him, and prevent him from taking to\r\nflight. His love of liberty is as great as that of the wildest animals,\r\nand in the female elephants it even overpowers maternal love; therefore,\r\nwhen suckling their young, they are never released from their chains,\r\nfor experience has proved that they will abandon them without regret\r\nif circumstances should enable them to effect their escape.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CORRAL IN CEYLON.]\r\n\r\nThe moral and intellectual qualities of the elephant have been greatly\r\nexaggerated. As far as his morality is concerned, we must pronounce him\r\na cowardly, pettish, and rancorous animal, which retains a much livelier\r\nrecollection of every injury done him than of the benefits he may have\r\nreceived. In an intellectual point of view he is certainly inferior to\r\nthe ape and the dog, but he is superior to the Carnaria, as well as to\r\nmost of the Herbivora. His faculties, perhaps, may be most justly\r\ncompared to those of the horse, which would certainly have exhibited as\r\nmuch intelligence if Nature had gifted him with a trunk; for we must\r\nnever forget that the development of an animal's faculties greatly\r\ndepends upon the perfection of his organs. Again, the horse is\r\nsusceptible of a complete domestication, while the elephant, as Boitard\r\nhas remarked, is a captive, ever dreading, never loving his master, and\r\neagerly awaiting a favourable moment to escape from him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the Elephant, the chief of the animals inhabiting the forests is\r\nthe Rhinoceros, ranged with him by Linné in the order of _Belluæ_ (or\r\nenormous beasts), by Cuvier in that of Pachyderms, and by De Blainville\r\nin that of Gravigrades.\r\n\r\nThe name _Rhinoceros_ ([Greek: rhin], nose, and [Greek: keras], horn)\r\nindicates at once the peculiarity which at the first glance\r\ndistinguishes him from the other Pachyderms. He carries, in fact, upon\r\nthe arch formed by his nasal bones one or two solid, curved, and\r\nsharp-pointed horns, which serve him as very formidable weapons. His\r\nears are upright, pointed, and moderately large; the eyes small and half\r\nclosed. The coarse thick skin, knotty or granulated on its surface, is\r\nof such tenacity and impenetrability about the short thick legs and\r\nungainly body, that it resists the claws of the lion or the tiger, the\r\nsword or the shot of the hunter. It hangs about the neck in several\r\nlarge plaits or folds; another fold passes from the shoulders to the\r\nfore-legs, and another from the hind part of the back to the thighs. He\r\nhas a moderately large and long head, a protruding upper lip, and a\r\ndepressed skull. His manners are fierce, but not aggressive; he leads a\r\nlethargic life, and wallows on the marshy banks of lakes and rivers,\r\nwhere grows the vegetable food on which he exclusively feeds. He usually\r\nmeasures about twelve feet in length from the tip of the nose to the\r\ninsertion of the tail; his height is about seven feet; and the girth of\r\nhis body is nearly equal to its length!\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Rhinoceros upon the globe was probably\r\ncontemporaneous with that of the Proboscideæ. Fossil remains of the\r\nanimal have been discovered in the temperate, and even the cold\r\ncountries of Asia and Europe. In 1772 an entire rhinoceros, admirably\r\npreserved, was found embedded on the banks of a Siberian river, in the\r\nancient frozen soil. Now-a-days he is exclusively confined to the\r\ntropical regions of the Old World. He lives a solitary life in the dense\r\njungles of India, the Sunda Islands, Central and Austral Africa.\r\nNaturalists distinguish six varieties--the Rhinoceros of India, the\r\none-horned Rhinoceros of Java, the two-horned Rhinoceros of Sumatra, the\r\nunarmed Rhinoceros, the two-horned Rhinoceros of Africa, and the\r\nRhinoceros of Bruce.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Rhinoceros attains the height of five to six feet, and the\r\nlength of seven to nine feet. He confines his wanderings in the main to\r\nthe Trans-Gangetic peninsula. He has but one horn, and some dim\r\ntradition of this animal may probably have suggested the long popular\r\nfable of the mysterious Unicorn. His skin, of a dusky brown, is so\r\nsingularly thick that it would have rendered all movement impossible on\r\nthe part of the quadruped, if Nature had not disposed it in deep folds\r\ncorresponding to the principal articulations. Thus he seems to the eye\r\ncaparisoned in a body-armour of thick leather, formed in several pieces;\r\nand in truth his impervious hide constitutes a cuirass against which\r\neven musket-balls strike innocuously. Hence he dreads not the attacks of\r\nany of the Carnivora.\r\n\r\nThe Rhinoceros of Java is undoubtedly but a variety of the Indian\r\nspecies. That of Sumatra differs from the preceding in the possession of\r\ntwo horns--one, the anterior, of great length; the other, much shorter.\r\nHis skin is moderately thick, very much wrinkled, in deep folds, and\r\ngarnished with a quantity of long hair.\r\n\r\nThe unarmed Rhinoceros, who inhabits the islands of the Ganges, has but\r\none rudimentary horn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAFFIR HUNTER CARRIED OFF BY A RHINOCEROS.]\r\n\r\nThe African Rhinoceros is the king of his race. He wears a naked,\r\nsmooth, and tenacious skin. Two horns are mounted on his upper jaw; the\r\nfront one measures more than eighteen inches in length. In all Southern\r\nand Western Africa this huge ungainly quadruped is found.\r\n\r\nThe Rhinoceros of Bruce inhabits Abyssinia. His supreme idea of\r\nhappiness, of the _summum bonum_, as viewed from a _Proboscidean_ point\r\nof view, is to wallow luxuriously in the mud and slime, and while\r\nabandoning himself to this anti-Sybaritic indulgence, he heaves a hoarse\r\ngroan of satisfaction, which conducts the hunter to his retreat. The\r\nAbyssinians pursue him on horseback. Some attack him with arrows or with\r\nmusketry; others, and these are the boldest, leap from their steeds at\r\nthe moment the rhinoceros leaps upon him, and hamstring him with their\r\nsabres. The huge quadruped falls immediately, and becomes an easy prey\r\nto his aggressors.[172] In South Africa the Kaffirs and the Hottentots\r\ndisplay an equal audacity in attacking this formidable foe. They dare to\r\nconfront him with their sharp knives alone, and generally with success,\r\nthough a weak thrust or a wrong aim would entail upon them a sudden,\r\nswift, and terrible death.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper Rose, in his \"Sketch of South Africa,\" celebrates an aged\r\nchief who had won a well-deserved renown by the most extraordinary\r\ninstance of courage and presence of mind. He was out a-hunting. A\r\nrhinoceros broke abruptly from the covert of a dense thicket, and so\r\nnear to him, that the Kaffir easily leaped upon his back. The furious\r\nanimal immediately dashed through the jungle, beat the earth with his\r\nhorn, roared with rage, and used his utmost exertions to dismount his\r\nunwelcome rider. In this he would have undoubtedly succeeded, and the\r\nnegro must have perished, if happily the kross, or sheepskin mantle of\r\nthe latter, had not been caught in the bushes. Mad with fury, the\r\nrhinoceros threw himself upon it, and while he was busy rending it in\r\nfragments the Kaffir leaped lightly to the ground, and saved himself in\r\nthe deep recesses of the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE VIRGIN FORESTS:--THE GREAT APES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is of their own free choice, to shelter themselves from the burning\r\narrows of the sun, to enjoy the dense shadows and delicious coolness of\r\nthe great trees, and, without doubt, to avoid the attacks of men, that\r\nthe elephant and the rhinoceros are denizens of the forest. But a\r\ncertain number of Mammals Nature seems to have specially designed to\r\npeople the forests, and for whom their general organization, and, above\r\nall, the structure of their locomotive organs, appear to have left the\r\nselection of no other abode. Such are, in the first place, the genera,\r\nso numerous and so diverse, which compose the great order of Quadrumana\r\n(\"four-handed\"), indistinctly comprehended, in popular phraseology,\r\nunder the denomination of Apes; such, too, are the curious arboreal\r\nanimals called Sloths; and such, finally, in the order Rodentia, are the\r\nSquirrels.\r\n\r\nIn occupying ourselves, primarily, with the _Apes_, we do but conform to\r\nthe scientific classifications, all of which place these Mammals\r\nimmediately next to Man in the zoological series.\r\n\r\nLinné originally proposed to designate, under the name of\r\n_Primates_--that is, the first, or chief of animals--Man, in the first\r\nplace; next, the Apes; then the Galeopitheci (or Lemurs); and, finally,\r\nthe Cheiroptera (or Bats). This order of Primates, established by the\r\ngreat Swedish naturalist, has been admitted by the majority of\r\ncontemporary authors, who, however, have separated the Cheiroptera from\r\nit. Many have also separated Man, and, as I think, have more correctly\r\nplaced him as a distinct genus in the order Bimana (or two-handed).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Apes, or Quadrumana, are divided into two families--that of Apes,\r\nproperly so called, and that of the Lemuridæ, or Lemurs. Both belong\r\nexclusively to the hottest regions of the globe. The latter are found\r\nonly in India, Africa, and Madagascar. The Apes, on the other hand, are\r\nalso spread through South America; but it is in the Old World we\r\nencounter the most numerous, the most varied, and the most remarkable\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThose writers who are so much addicted to tracing analogies between Man\r\nand the Ape, should explain how and why it is the latter attains his\r\ngreatest development precisely in those regions where Man's intellect is\r\ndwarfed, \"cribbed, cabined, and confined.\"\r\n\r\nTo the ancient continent especially belong the great apes without tail,\r\nor with very short and rudimentary tail--Anthropomorphes, Baboons,\r\nMacaucos, and the Cynocephali.\r\n\r\nApes, as well as the other Primates, are all inhabitants of tropical\r\ncountries. They do not exist in Europe, in Upper Asia, or in North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nA single genus seems able to adapt itself to the climate and conditions\r\nof the Temperate Zone, and still reigns in the Mediterranean region--in\r\nAfrica, to the north of the Atlas; in Spain, on the rock and in the\r\nneighbourhood of Gibraltar--this is the genus Baboon (the _Pithecus_ of\r\nthe classical writers), included in the family Macaucos. It differs from\r\nother genera of the same family in being tailless. This organ is\r\nrudimentary in some species of Macaucos, properly so called--as in the\r\nRed-faced Macauco of Japan; in others, its length never exceeds that of\r\nthe animal's body. It is the same with the genus Mangabey. Among the\r\nCynocephali, the tail is usually short. These apes are remarkable, as\r\ntheir name indicates, for their prominent muzzle, which resembles that\r\nof a dog; and, moreover, for the naked callosities, more or less\r\nextensive and of a bluish or vivid red colour, which exist on the upper\r\npart of their thighs, immediately beneath the tail.\r\n\r\nThe Macaucos and the Cynocephali are, in general, of tall stature. When\r\nstanding upright, they will be about two and a half to three feet in\r\nheight, but this posture is not natural to them, and they rarely adopt\r\nit unless constrained. For their hinder limbs being of nearly the same\r\nlength as the fore, the quadrupedal mode of progression is easy and\r\nhabitual, either when they move on the ground or traverse the horizontal\r\nbranches of the trees among which they live. These apes are endowed with\r\nsurprising strength, and several, especially among the Cynocephali,\r\nrender themselves formidable by their ferocity and their aggressive\r\naudacity. In captivity they show, while young, a mildness of disposition\r\nwhich, joined to their keen intelligence, would seem to render them\r\ncapable of being greatly improved by careful training. But these good\r\ninclinations do not long endure: arrived at the adult age, the Macaucos\r\nand Cynocephali soon allow all their malignity, mischievousness,\r\nbrutality, and vicious instincts to peep out, and as they grow older\r\nbecome completely intractable.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Desfontaines baboons were so common in the forests of the\r\nAtlas, that in the environs of Stora the trees were frequently covered\r\nwith them. \"They feed,\" says that author, \"on pine apples, sweet nuts,\r\nIndian figs, melons, water-melons, and the vegetables which they pilfer\r\nfrom the gardens of the Arabs, whatever cares the latter may exercise to\r\nkeep these ill-doing animals at a distance. While engaged in their\r\nthieving operations, two or three mount to the top of the tallest trees\r\nand loftiest rocks to keep watch, and when they perceive any person\r\napproaching, or hear any noise, they give a cry of alarm; whereupon the\r\nwhole troop immediately take flight, carrying with them all they have\r\nbeen able to seize.\" Despite of these predatory habits, the baboons at\r\nGibraltar have been fortunate enough to find powerful protectors in the\r\nofficers of the British garrison, without whom they would have been\r\ndestroyed. A prohibition against hunting them exists throughout the\r\nterritory under British rule.\r\n\r\nAt the Cape of Good Hope, and at other points of Southern Africa,\r\nEuropeans are far from displaying the same amount of goodwill towards\r\nthe Cynocephali. It is true that they are formidable enemies to man\r\nthrough their malignity, their strength, and the dangers incurred from\r\ntheir bite. Their mouth is armed, in fact, with canine teeth comparable\r\nto those of the most powerful Carnivora. The wounds, therefore, says M.\r\nPaul Gervais, which they inflict, either in defence, or, as is more\r\ncustomary with them, in attack, are deep, and consequently very\r\ndangerous. These apes are fiercer in disposition than the Macaucos, and\r\ninspire so much fear when grown up that one of their species is\r\npopularly known by the expressive name of the \"Man-Tiger.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BABOONS PLUNDERING A GARDEN.]\r\n\r\nWe must not confound the Cynocephali with the Cynopitheci, an\r\nintermediate genus between the Apes and the Macaucos, which connects\r\nboth the former and the latter with the Anthropomorphes. The Cynopitheci\r\nhave no tail; their face is moderately elongated; their ears are round\r\nand rimmed. The type-species of this genus is the Negro Cynopithecus,\r\nwho is wholly black, and a little smaller than the Baboon. His head is\r\ncrowned with a kind of head-dress raised to a point on the forehead; and\r\nhis face surrounded with a fringe of long hair. His habitat is the\r\nCelebes, and some other islands situated between Borneo and Mindanaos.\r\nHe possesses a mild and lively disposition. Quoy and Gaymard,\r\nnaturalists on board the French exploring-ship _L'Astrolabe_, obtained\r\nan individual who was readily tamed, and played in the gayest and\r\nbest-tempered manner possible with the first person he encountered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLACK CYNOPITHECUS.]\r\n\r\nI may here pause to indicate a few of the more remarkable varieties of\r\nthe Baboon and the Monkey: premising that by a recent classification the\r\nApes, or Simiæ, are divided into four sections--viz.: Apes, or such as\r\nare tailless; Baboons, with elongated muzzles and short tails; Monkeys,\r\ngenerally with long tails; and Sapajous, or Monkeys with prehensile\r\ntails. For the present, I limit my remarks to members of the second and\r\nthird sections.\r\n\r\nAmong the Monkeys of the Old Continent a prominent place should be given\r\nto the Proboscis Monkey (_Nasalis larvatus_), who is endowed--I may not\r\nsay, ornamented--with a nose of the most grotesque character and\r\nformidable dimensions. This species measures two feet from the tip of\r\nthe nose to the tail, which is longer than the body. His colour is a\r\ndark chestnut, but the face is marked with blue and red. He belongs to\r\nBorneo and Cochin-China, where he assembles in large troops, and feeds\r\nwholly on fruit.\r\n\r\nTo Cochin-China also belongs the _Douc_, a very large species,\r\nremarkable for their coat of many colours. Back, belly, and sides are of\r\na yellowish-gray; feet black; lower part of the arms and tail, white; a\r\ncollar of brownish-purple encircles the neck; long yellowish hairs\r\nfringe the sides of the face, which is rather flat and of a yellowish\r\nbay hue. He measures, when standing upright, three feet and a half to\r\nfour feet.\r\n\r\nIn South America are found the _Howling Monkeys_. Mr. Bates describes\r\none species, the _Mycetes strumineus_, which measures sixteen inches in\r\nlength, exclusive of the tail; the whole body is covered with rather\r\nlong and shining dingy-white hair, the whiskers and beard only being of\r\na tawny hue. \"The one of which I am speaking,\" says Mr. Bates,[173] \"was\r\nnot quite full grown. When it first arrived, it occasionally made a\r\ngruff subdued howling noise early in the morning. The deep volume of\r\nsound in the voice of the howling monkeys, as is well known, is produced\r\nby a drum-shaped expansion of the larynx. It was curious to watch the\r\nanimal whilst venting its hollow cavernous roar, and observe how small\r\nwas the muscular exertion employed. When Howlers are seen in the forest,\r\nthere are generally three or four of them mounted on the topmost\r\nbranches of a tree. It does not appear that their harrowing roar is\r\nemitted from sudden alarm; at least, it was not so in captive\r\nindividuals. It is probable, however, that the noise serves to\r\nintimidate their enemies.\"\r\n\r\nAnother species of Howlers is the Preacher Monkey (_Mycetes Beelzebub_),\r\nan animal about the size of a fox, with long black glossy hair, a round\r\nbeard beneath the chin and throat, black glistening eyes, short round\r\nears, and a long tail. A native of Brazil and Guiana, he derives his\r\nname from the following circumstance: one of these creatures will climb\r\nto the summit of a lofty tree, while numbers gather about the lower\r\nbranches. The monkey perched above the rest then raises a loud howl--a\r\nhowl so shrill and keen that it is audible at a very great distance;\r\nafter a while he pauses, and gives a signal with his hand, whereupon the\r\nentire assembly join in chorus; another signal, and the discord ceases,\r\nwhile the preacher or singer concludes his inharmonious\r\nexercitation.[174] It is said that this howling faculty is due to the\r\npeculiar conformation of the _os hyoides_, or throat-bone, which,\r\ncommunicating with the larynx, increases the resonance of the voice.\r\n\r\nThe Paters, or Red Monkey (_Cercopithecus ruber_), so called from the\r\nbright bay colour of his upper parts, is a native of Senegal.\r\n\r\nIn Congo and Guinea is found the frolicsome Spotted or Diana Monkey\r\n(_Cercopithecus Diana_), the upper parts of whose body are of a reddish\r\ncolour, besprinkled with white spots.\r\n\r\nThe Mandrill, or Variegated Baboon (_Cynocephalus maimon_), is,\r\nundoubtedly, the most notable of his genus, for various and brilliant\r\ncolours. When standing upright he measures fully five feet. His body is\r\nthick and robust, his limbs are firm and muscular; scarcely any forehead\r\nrelieves the flatness of his long face; the eyes are small and deeply\r\nsunken in the large head; the projecting cheek-bones are marked with\r\nseveral deep furrows of purple, scarlet, and violet blue; both the\r\nabrupt muzzle and the lips are large and protuberant. The hair of the\r\nforehead and temples rises in a kind of pyramid, which gives to the head\r\na triangular appearance; and from the chin hangs a small pointed\r\norange-yellow beard. His strength, moroseness, and ferocity, render him\r\na formidable opponent; and as he prowls about in large bands, it is\r\ndangerous for the natives to penetrate into the woods, unless\r\nwell-armed, and in numerous companies.\r\n\r\nThe Derrias (_Cynocephalus hamadryas_), a native of the mountains of\r\nArabia and Abyssinia, measures upwards of four feet when standing erect,\r\nand about two feet and a half in a sitting posture. The hair of the head\r\nand neck gathers in a long mane, which falls back over the shoulders;\r\nthe broad whiskers incline backwards so as to cover the ears. The long\r\nface is of a dirty flesh-colour; long, shaggy, brownish hair covers the\r\nhead, neck, shoulders, and all the fore-part of the body. The tail\r\nterminates in a long tuft of brown hair.\r\n\r\nEqual in size to, but much stronger than, an English mastiff is the\r\nChacma, or Pig-faced Baboon (_Cynocephalus porcarius_), of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, where he inhabits the mountains, and makes frequent forays in\r\nthe gardens and plantations around Cape Town. His yells and screams make\r\nnight hideous. He wears a sober livery of an uniform dark brown colour,\r\nwith long shaggy mane-like hair about his neck and shoulders. His skull\r\nis contracted and flattened, his muzzle extremely prolonged, and the\r\ncheeks of both sexes are ornamented with small grayish whiskers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must now direct our attention to the Anthropomorphes, or Apes with a\r\nsemi-human form, which, of all the Quadrumana, approach nearest to man\r\nin form, stature, internal and external conformation, manners, instinct,\r\nand development of intelligence. They have no tail, and the Gibbons\r\n(_Pithecus lar_), which occupy the lowest rank among them, possess only\r\nthe rudiments of ischiatic callosities. Nor are they provided with those\r\ndilatable pouches worn by a great number of other Primates on each side\r\nof the mouth, and named by French naturalists _abajoues_. Their\r\nposition, when they move along the ground, is bent rather than erect,\r\nand they assist themselves by their extraordinarily long anterior arms.\r\nThese arms, in fact, are much longer than their legs; their thumbs, at\r\nthe four extremities, are opposed to the other fingers; the palm of\r\ntheir hands and the sole of their feet are naked, as well as their face.\r\nThe sternum is large and flat; the clavicles are short and well\r\narticulated.\r\n\r\nThe analogies between the Apes and Man are so striking and so numerous,\r\nand their intelligence, at least in the largest genera, is so superior\r\nto that of other animals, that, without admitting the opinion of the\r\nancient naturalists who considered them to be degraded or degenerate\r\nmen, nor that of certain modern writers, who look upon Man as an\r\nimproved Ape, one cannot fail to recognize between them and us a species\r\nof kinship--though it may be very difficult to distinguish the character\r\nand the degree--which imposes itself upon the understanding and the\r\nsentiment of every impartial and attentive observer. The most impassive\r\nhunters who have killed Orangs, Gibbons, Chimpanzees, and Gorillas,\r\nacknowledge that they have never been able to conquer a painful\r\nimpression--almost, as it were, a feeling of remorse--when contemplating\r\nthe semi-human agony of their victims. This impression, though they may\r\nhave succeeded in persuading themselves to the contrary, is not the\r\neffect of an empty or ridiculous sensibility. Everything in nature has\r\nits _raison d'être_--its motive of existence; the relations between the\r\norganism and the faculties are constant and undeniable; and I find it\r\ndifficult to believe that the Creator can have formed without object or\r\npurpose beings so extraordinarily similar to man, unless this physical\r\nresemblance corresponds to a more or less definite moral analogy.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious and devout Linné, whom no one will suspect either of\r\nmaterialism, or of forgetfulness of the dignity of man, has ranked the\r\nAnthropomorphes in his genus _Homo_, with MAN, whom he specifically\r\ndistinguishes by his wholly exceptional faculties, and whom he\r\ndenominates _Homo sapiens_, that is, \"the wise,\" or more correctly\r\nspeaking, the \"thinking man.\" I must add that Linné at a later period\r\nrenounced this quasi-assimilation, and that modern zoologists have\r\nunanimously rejected it.[175]\r\n\r\nIn the age of Linné, the apes of which we speak were but imperfectly\r\nknown. Even now-a-days our information upon the subjects of their\r\nintelligence, manners, and habits, is defective and fragmentary. The\r\nindividuals whom we have retained in captivity have died while very\r\nyoung, and it is impossible to say whether their early mildness and\r\nintelligence would have proved as transitory in them as in the Macaucos\r\nand the Cynocephali, who, as they advance in years, display the most\r\nbrutal instincts. In their adult state, the Anthropomorphic Apes have\r\nnot been really studied. Travellers have penetrated into their forests\r\nonly to attack them with rifle-balls, and have told us but little of the\r\nmanner in which they comport themselves. As for the details collected\r\nfrom natives inhabiting their vicinity, they are so contradictory, and\r\nmixed up with so much which is fabulous, that it is impossible to draw\r\nany conclusions from them in reference to the habits of these animals.\r\n\r\nFour distinct genera of the Anthropomorphic Apes are now recognized by\r\nnaturalists: two belonging to Southern Asia, or rather the great Indian\r\nArchipelago--viz., the Orang and the Gibbon; two to Tropical\r\nAfrica--viz., the Chimpanzee and the Gorilla. I shall describe their\r\npeculiarities in my next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ANTHROPOMORPHIC APES:--ORANGS, GIBBONS, CHIMPANZEES, AND GORILLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genus Orang-Outang (_Simia Satyrus_), or \"Wild Man of the Woods,\" is\r\na native of the islands of Borneo, Sumatra, and Java, and of a limited\r\nportion of the Malayan peninsula. We must dismiss as travellers' fables\r\nthe exaggerated recitals which attribute to this Ape a gigantic stature\r\n(six to seven feet). The tallest specimens which have reached Europe\r\nhave not exceeded four feet in height. The Orang has short and feeble\r\nlower limbs; but his arms, on the contrary, are very robust, and of such\r\na length that he can touch the ground while standing upright--a posture,\r\nhowever, which is neither natural nor convenient for him. His ordinary\r\nmode of locomotion consists in passing from one tree to another by\r\nswinging himself from branch to branch, his progress being as rapid as\r\nthat of a swift horse, and his agility not less wonderful than that of\r\nour Leotards and Blondins. His body is covered with coarse reddish hair,\r\nwhose shade varies according to his age. It is thick on the head,\r\nshoulders, and body, but thin about the fore-parts. The face has a\r\nbluish cast, and is partly naked; but the eyes sink under bushy,\r\nprominent eye-brows, and the upper lip, chin, and cheeks are garnished\r\nwith a sort of longish beard. Naked are the exterior face and palm of\r\nthe hands. Where the skin is deprived of hair, its colour is of a hodden\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nThe Orang-Outang has a large protuberant belly, a flat nose, small ears,\r\nprojecting muzzle, long, thin, and very extensible lips. In youth the\r\nforehead projects; but as the creature grows older, it becomes depressed\r\nat the same time that the face lengthens; the face assumes a more\r\ndecided bestial type; and the intelligence, lively and quick at first,\r\ndeclines into obtuseness and atrophy. The head inclines forward; the\r\nneck is short, thick, and seemingly afflicted with gôitre, which is due\r\nto the presence of the pouch called thyroïdian. This pouch, placed above\r\nthe sternum, extends beneath the arm-holes, and communicates with the\r\nlarynx. When expanded, it is capable of receiving a great quantity of\r\nair, which, being afterwards expelled very slowly, and passing anew\r\nthrough the vocal organ, produces a dull and prolonged murmur.\r\n\r\nThe Orangs have now disappeared from Continental India, and even, we are\r\nassured, from Java, so that their chief habitats at present are Borneo\r\nand Sumatra; and here too they are few in number. The genus is rapidly\r\ndying out. Those which remain seek in the dense and marshy forests an\r\nasylum from the attacks of man, and a shelter against the climate.\r\nDuring the day, they traverse the summits of the trees in quest of\r\nfood, for they subsist exclusively upon leaves, young shoots, tender\r\nbark, and fruits. At nightfall they conceal themselves amid the foliage\r\nof some moderately tall tree, or in the great tufts of orchids which\r\nflourish about the arboreal giants. There they make for themselves a\r\ncouch like an even floor or platform, garnish it with leaves and\r\ninterwoven branches, and stretch themselves upon it, or sit crouching,\r\nto enjoy their slumbers. It is said that when the necessity arises they\r\nspread over themselves a similarly-fashioned canopy as a shelter from\r\nthe rain.\r\n\r\nThe Orang-Outang is timid and inoffensive; he rarely engages in a combat\r\nwith his enemies. At times, however, when driven to extremities, he\r\nresorts to his great muscular strength in self-defence, and if he can\r\nsucceed in grappling with his antagonist, he rends him to pieces with\r\nhis tenacious hands; never using his teeth, although his jaws are very\r\npowerful, and armed with canine teeth capable of inflicting dangerous\r\nwounds. In general, when he feels himself sorely stricken, he hurriedly\r\nclimbs to the summit of the loftiest tree within his reach, and if he\r\nfinds himself still pursued, he passes on to another. Meanwhile he\r\nutters the most dolorous cries, and vents his impotent rage upon the\r\ntree which serves him for a refuge. One after another he breaks the\r\ngreatest branches; but they immediately escape from his grasp, and fall\r\nto the ground. It is this circumstance which has originated the\r\nassertions of many travellers, that the Orang defends himself by hurling\r\nboughs at his aggressors, and even by striking them heavy blows with a\r\nstick. The truth is, that far from protracting his defence by the\r\nexpedient his fury prompts him to adopt, he does but expose himself the\r\nmore fully to the projectiles directed at him. The stripped tree is no\r\nlonger available as a shelter. The Malay hunters, therefore, take no\r\nheed of all this fracas, but patiently wait until the Orang has exposed\r\nhimself, to aim their arrows or rifle-balls with the greater certainty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH OF AN ORANG-OUTANG.]\r\n\r\nSeveral tribes of Borneo manifest a strange partiality for the flesh of\r\nthe Orangs, and eat it as a great dainty, either roasting it over a\r\nfire, or cutting it into steaks and drying it in the sun. The Indians\r\nmake use of his skin for helmets and caps of fantastic device, which\r\nthey don upon festival days, or to give themselves, when necessary, a\r\nformidable air.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of the Gibbons (_Hylobates_) is more extensive in range than\r\nthat of the Orangs. They are found not only in Sumatra, in Borneo, in\r\nthe Celebes and Philippine Islands, but in considerable portions of the\r\ntwo peninsulas within and beyond the Ganges. In size they are inferior\r\nto the Anthropomorphes, their stature not exceeding three feet. Their\r\nhead is small and rounded, their muzzle does but slightly project, and\r\ntheir face wears a pleasanter expression than that of the great apes of\r\nthe same group. A sort of thick black or very dark fur, with\r\noccasionally patches of white, enwraps their entire body. They have arms\r\nand hands of extraordinary length, but a slightly developed belly. They\r\nlive upon the forest-trees, which they traverse without ever descending\r\nto the ground, exhibiting a marvellous agility and suppleness. They are\r\ncompletely frugivorous; their manners are gentle; their intelligence\r\nthey retain, and even develop, after they have attained maturity.\r\nAlthough they should be captured after they have passed their youth,\r\nthey easily become domesticated, and display a loyal affection towards\r\ntheir masters. Unfortunately the climate of Europe, and perhaps, in\r\nparticular, the atmosphere of menageries, proves fatal to them, and\r\nthose individuals placed in the Zoological Gardens of London and Paris\r\nsuccumb, after a brief residence, to dysentery or pulmonary disease.\r\n\r\nThe genus Gibbon comprises several species: the _Gibbon-Siamang_\r\n(_Hylobates syndactylus_) is the greatest of which we have any\r\nknowledge. Black is he as ebony, both in face and hair. His thyroïdian\r\npouch is very large, and of great expansive powers. By means of this\r\nungainly organ he utters the most horrible, deafening, and prolonged\r\ncries, which, it is said, can be heard for several leagues around. He is\r\ncommon enough in Sumatra, inhabiting the dense wild woods which lie to\r\nthe north of Bencoolen. He owes his characteristic epithet of\r\n_syndactylus_ to the fact that the index and middle finger of his\r\nhind-feet (or shall I say, hands?) are united ([Greek: syn]) by a\r\nnarrow membrane, which extends even to the base of the ungueal phalange.\r\n\r\nThe Gibbon-Lar (_Hylobates_ or _Pythecus Lar_) is smaller than the\r\npreceding. His skin is of a blackish-brown, with the four extremities\r\nand the framing of the face white. He ranges over the peninsula of\r\nMalacca, and, according to some travellers, the kingdom of Siam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIBBON-SIAMANG AND MOURNING GIBBON.]\r\n\r\nThe Wou-Wou, or Silvery Gibbon (_Hylobates leuciscus_), another Malayan\r\nspecies, commends himself to our notice by the silvery gray of his skin\r\non the upper parts of the body and the outer sides of the anus and legs.\r\nHis name of \"Wou-Wou\" is intended to describe his peculiar utterance--a\r\nkind of clucking totally unlike the howlings of the other gibbons.\r\n\r\nAshen-gray is the colour of the skin of the Mourning Gibbon (_Hylobates\r\nfunereus_) on the external sides of his limbs, while the belly and\r\ncontour of the face, and the inner parts, are of a blackish hue.\r\n\r\nThe _Hylobates cinereus_ is of an uniform cindery-gray. He inhabits the\r\nSunda Islands, and principally Java, and numerous individuals of his\r\nspecies have been imported into Europe. His disposition is gentle and\r\naffectionate; he quickly familiarizes himself with the persons who\r\napproach him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe genus Chimpanzee (_Pithecus troglodytes_) is by some later\r\nnaturalists preferred to that foremost place among the Quadrumana in\r\nwhich Cuvier had installed the orang-outang. He certainly approaches the\r\nnearest--though _longo intervallo_--to man, of all his race. He was long\r\nconfounded with other Anthropomorphous genera, under the vague name of\r\n\"Man of the Woods\" (_Homo sylvestris_). It would appear to have been the\r\nChimpanzee that Buffon had in his \"mind's eye\" when describing his\r\nJocko; although that ideal variety of shaggy men, with flat, oval\r\nvisage, long legs, tall and erect figure, which stands before us in the\r\ngreat naturalist's pages, bears but little resemblance to the animal we\r\nhave seen in the Zoological Gardens, or the more faithful and judicious\r\nportrait drawn by modern travellers. But the name of Jocko is evidently\r\na corruption of that of _Enge-eko_, which the negroes of the Gaboon\r\nbestow upon the Chimpanzee, just as the latter appellation is an\r\nimperfect reproduction of that of _Quimpezé_, in use among the negroes\r\nof Angola.\r\n\r\nPutting aside these speculations, we see that the only well-defined\r\nspecies of this genus is the black Chimpanzee (_Troglodytes niger_ of\r\nthe present nomenclature, _Pygmea_ of Tyson). His home is the forests of\r\nthe Gaboon, the coast of Angola, and Guinea. His face is larger and\r\nflatter than that of the orang. He has large ears, but shaped like those\r\nof men. On the head, shoulders, and back, he wears a coat of long black\r\nhair; his legs are short, and his arms very long; yet he is better able\r\nto walk like a biped than the macaucos, or even the orangs and the\r\ngibbons. Of all the Simidæ, he alone has calves to his legs. He has\r\nneither tail, ischiatic callosities, _abajoues_, nor thyroïdian pouch.\r\nThe hair of his head is parted on the summit, and falls down on either\r\nside, surrounding the ear and jaws, and mingling with that of the neck.\r\nHis bare, wrinkled face is of a light copper colour; so are the palms of\r\nhis hands, and his fingers, but his nails are generally black.\r\n\r\nThe highest stature to which the Chimpanzee can attain is about four and\r\na half feet; but as he never stands absolutely erect, he appears much\r\nshorter. His small eyes, deep sunken in their orbits, are of a dark\r\nhazel colour. The cranium, even in young specimens, is depressed, and\r\npresents, in advance of a low receding forehead, a projecting\r\nsuperciliary ridge. As the animal advances in years, his muzzle\r\nlengthens, his jaws develop, his skull grows more depressed; at the same\r\ntime his intelligence gradually disappears, his manners become fiercer,\r\nand his disposition less tractable; in a word, the instincts of the\r\nbrute regain their supremacy. Such, at least, is the statement of the\r\nbest accredited authorities; as for the individuals imported into\r\nEurope, they invariably die at too early an age for any one to study\r\ntheir habits and character in maturity.\r\n\r\nThe Chimpanzees live, it is said, in troops in the forests, or at least\r\nthey congregate for the purpose of repelling the attacks made upon them\r\nby the carnaria, and to drive from their domains such other animals as\r\nmay attempt to install themselves therein to their disadvantage. Their\r\nweapons are ready to their hand--stones and the branches of trees. Their\r\ndiet is essentially a frugivorous one; yet they will occasionally\r\nindulge in a lizard or two, or any other reptile. Like the orangs, they\r\nconstruct rude beds or couches, of interwoven boughs stripped of their\r\ngreenery. The negroes of Guinea, scarcely much higher in the scale of\r\nintelligence than themselves, look upon them as a _nation_, and believe\r\nthat if these Men of the Woods do not speak, it is because they fear to\r\nbe condemned to work or carried off into slavery, and not from\r\nincapacity.\r\n\r\nA recent traveller, whose adventures have been the subject of much\r\ndiscussion, and who for a considerable period enjoyed the reputation of\r\na Mendez Pinto or a Munchausen, asserts that he discovered at the\r\nGaboon two new species of Chimpanzees. One, called by the natives\r\n_Nshiégo-Mbouvé_, and to which he gave the scientific name of\r\n_Troglodytes calvus_, builds for himself some leafy screens of quite\r\nartistic construction upon isolated trees. He is smaller than the\r\nordinary Chimpanzee, and _bald_.\r\n\r\nThe other species distinguished by M. Du Chaillu[176] is the\r\n_Kooloo-Kamba_. He is distinguished from all his congeners by a very\r\npeculiar cry. While offering a general resemblance to man, he approaches\r\nhim more nearly in certain respects than all the other known apes. His\r\nhead is very remarkable, and presents a curious analogy to that of an\r\nEsquimaux or a Chinese. His face is hairless, and wholly black. The\r\nforehead is loftier than that of any of his congeners, and the capacity\r\nof his skull is also greater in proportion to his height. A wider space\r\noccurs between his eyes than is customary with the great Simiadæ. He has\r\na flattened nose, high projecting cheek-bones, hollow cheeks, and a\r\nwell-marked orbitary arch. The muzzle is less prominent, and larger in\r\nproportion than that of other apes. Both sides of his face are\r\nornamented with straight tufts of hair, which, joining below the chin\r\nlike whiskers, communicate a strange human character to the whole\r\ncountenance. His arms descend below his knees. All the body is hairy.\r\nThe shoulders are broad, the hands long and narrow, and well adapted for\r\nclimbing trees. Both arm and hand are exceedingly muscular; the abdomen\r\nis very prominent. The ample ears rather resemble those of a man than\r\nthe ears of any other ape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur peregrinations now bring us to the giant of the Quadrumana, the true\r\nking of the forests of Equatorial Africa; in a word, to the _Gorilla_,\r\nwhom Buffon has described under the name of _Pongo_, almost as exactly\r\nas he pictured the Chimpanzee under that of _Jacko_.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be said to have known the Gorilla for more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1847 that Dr. Savage, an American missionary, recognized the\r\nPongo as a species of the genus Troglodytes, distinct from the\r\nChimpanzee, and named him _Troglodytes Gorilla_, in allusion to the\r\ncelebrated narrative of the Carthaginian Hanno relative to the pretended\r\nfemale Gorillas which that navigator professed to have seen in an island\r\nof the Gulf of Guinea. Since that period the Gorilla has been carefully\r\nstudied by the eminent naturalist Professor Owen. Messieurs Gautier and\r\nFranquet, French naval surgeons, collected some important information\r\nupon the habits and physiology of this great ape, and M. Franquet\r\nprocured for the Paris Museum the skeleton of an adult Gorilla. Other\r\ndead and preserved specimens have since been imported into England and\r\nFrance, and the anatomy of this African Troglodytes is accurately known.\r\nAnd, finally, M. Du Chaillu, in the work already quoted, has supplied\r\nnumerous strange and interesting details, which, if at first discredited\r\nand contested, are now very generally accepted as strictly accurate.\r\n\r\nThe name of \"Pongo,\" applied to the Gorilla by Battel and Buffon, is\r\nclearly a modification or corruption of that of the tribe of Mpongwéss,\r\nwho dwell on the banks of the Gaboon, not far from the forests tenanted\r\nby this mysterious Quadrumane.\r\n\r\nThe Mpongwéss negroes call the Chimpanzee _Enge-eko_, and the Gorilla\r\n_Enge-ena_; whence the surname of \"Gina,\" linked to the zoological\r\nappellation of \"Gorilla\"--_Gorilla-Gina_.\r\n\r\nThe Gorilla appears to be confined in the dense wooded regions of Lower\r\nGuinea, where he shuns, and, if needs be, repels the approach of man and\r\nthat of the carnivorous animals, as well as of all those who attempt to\r\npenetrate into his retreats. Fierce and savage is he in his every\r\ncustom; but it has never been satisfactorily demonstrated that he acts\r\non the aggressive. He is not the less an object of extreme terror to his\r\nnegro neighbours, on account of his extraordinary strength; and much\r\nmore, perhaps, owing to the fantastic legends that have grown up about\r\nhis name. His stature exceeds four, and sometimes attains, it is said,\r\nto upwards of six feet. The most salient characteristics of his head are\r\nthe great width and elongation of the face, the development of the lower\r\njaw, and the smallness of the osseous framework, which surrounded by a\r\nvery elevated orbitary arch, whence proceeds a second ridge dominating\r\nover all the upper part of the skull. The nose is flat, the eye\r\ndeep-sunken in its orbit, the ear small, the mouth very large. The lips,\r\nespecially the lower one, are long and very extensible. The expression\r\nof the face is terrible, reminding one of Coleridge's painful picture of\r\na man-monster; and especially terrible when the animal raises the shaggy\r\nskin, and reveals the enormous fangs which bristle in his jaws.\r\n\r\nHis neck is thick, and so short, that the head seems grafted directly\r\nupon the shoulders. The latter are of formidable breadth, and his vast\r\nchest resounds like a drum when he beats it with his powerful fists,\r\nraising himself upright on his feet--an action which is with him a sign\r\nof mistrust, hatred, and indignation. He has a large expanded belly,\r\nlike that of the orang and chimpanzee. His skin is of a deep black,\r\nnaked on the face and on the palm of the hands, but elsewhere clothed\r\nwith a rough iron-gray or brown-black hair.\r\n\r\nThe breast of the male adult is hairless, like that of the female. With\r\nthe former the hair of the back is worn off, owing to his habit of\r\nsleeping on the ground supported against a tree. This peculiarity,\r\naccording to M. Du Chaillu, is only seen in the female when she has\r\nattained an advanced age, in which case it would seem to be owing to the\r\nfact that, having no longer her infants to shelter among the branches,\r\nshe sleeps in the same fashion as the male.\r\n\r\nThe natural walk of the Gorilla is not upon two feet, but upon four\r\npaws. In this posture, owing to the length of his arms, his head and\r\nchest are much elevated. When he runs, his hind-legs are brought up\r\nunder the body. The arm and the leg on the same side move\r\nsimultaneously, which gives the animal a curious and awkward gait. He\r\nruns, however, with extreme swiftness.\r\n\r\nDespite the strength of his jaws, despite his enormous canine teeth, the\r\nGorilla is exclusively frugivorous; but as he stands in need of abundant\r\nnourishment, he is compelled to change his quarters incessantly. His\r\nhabits, therefore, are essentially nomadic. He is not gregarious. M. Du\r\nChaillu affirms that he has never seen but a couple of adults together,\r\nthe male and the female; sometimes an aged male wanders about alone. Of\r\nthe young, as many as five will occasionally be found in company. It is\r\na difficult matter to approach them, for their hearing is very keen, and\r\nwhen alarmed they immediately take to flight, while the nature of the\r\nground embarrasses the hunter in his pursuit.\r\n\r\nEvery hunter who understands his _métier_ will reserve his fire, when\r\nchasing the Gorilla, until the last moment. Whether the furious beast\r\ntakes the report for a threatening defiance, or from some other unknown\r\ncause, if the hunter fires and misses, the Gorilla immediately pounces\r\nupon him, and no one can withstand the force of his attack. A single\r\nblow of his enormous foot, armed as it is with most formidable claws,\r\neviscerates a man, smashes in his chest, or batters his skull. Negroes\r\nin a like situation have been seen, reduced to despair by terror, to\r\nturn upon the Gorilla and aim at him their discharged musket; but they\r\nhave not even the time to level an inoffensive blow; the arm of their\r\nantagonist falls upon them with all its weight, shattering at once both\r\narm and gun. I know of no animal whose attack is so fatal to man, for\r\nthe reason that he dares to confront him face to face, with his arms for\r\nweapons of offence, exactly like a boxer, with the exception that he has\r\nthe advantage of longer arms, and a vigour far surpassing that of any\r\nathlete who has ever claimed the suffrages of the ring. Fortunately, the\r\nGorilla dies as easily as a man. A blow in the chest, if well-directed,\r\nimmediately lays him low. He falls forward on his face, his arms widely\r\nextended, and heaving with his last breath a frightful dying cry, half\r\nroar, half wail, which though a signal of safety for the hunter,\r\nnevertheless resounds painfully in his ear, like the supreme utterance\r\nof human agony.[177]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GORILLA KILLING A NEGRO.]\r\n\r\nThe negroes of the Gaboon are generally very partial to the flesh of the\r\nGorilla, as well as to that of the other great apes, although it is, in\r\nsooth, of a leathery character. This partiality need not surprise us on\r\nthe part of a race which too frequently indulge in a horrible banquet\r\noff their own kind. It has been observed that those tribes which are not\r\ncannibal do not share the liking of their neighbours for the flesh of\r\nthe Gorilla or the Chimpanzee; many even shrink from it with peculiar\r\nhorror, on account of the kinship existing, as they believe, between\r\nthese apes and man,--and the superstitious creed which represent these\r\nanimals as supernatural beings, whose bodies are the refuge of the souls\r\nof their relatives, or of their friends, labouring for their crimes\r\nunder an eternal curse!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE IN THE FORESTS:--THE CEBIDÆ, OR MONKEYS OF AMERICA--THE\r\nLEMURS--THE SLOTHS--THE SQUIRRELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Continent possesses, in addition to the great apes of which\r\nI have already spoken, the Macaucos, the Cynocephali, and the\r\nAnthropomorphes, other apes of more erect, and one might even say more\r\nelegant figures, essentially climbers, and provided with a long, but not\r\nprehensile tail. Such are the Semnopitheci and the Monkeys of the\r\nAfrican forests, of India and Indo-China, of Japan and the Indian\r\nArchipelago. These two latter groups approximate, by their external\r\nforms, to the apes of the New World; divided by Buffon into Sagouins and\r\nSapajous, but re-united in the new classification of naturalists under\r\none single family, named _Cebidæ_. These--one genus, the Brachiura,\r\nexcepted--have all a very long, and, generally, a prehensile tail. They\r\ndiffer, moreover, from the Simidæ of the Old World in the disposition of\r\ntheir nostrils, which are always open laterally, and separated by a\r\nthick depressed membrane; in such wise, that it might also be affirmed\r\nthey were gifted with two noses! By nature they are of a gentle and\r\nplacable disposition, readily domesticate themselves with man, and do\r\nnot become in their old age more impracticable or malicious than in\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nThe Cebidæ are divided into several genera, such as the _Howlers_, the\r\n_Atelæ_, the _Sajous_, the _Saïmris_, the _Nyctipitheci_, or Nocturnal\r\nApes; to which we may add, perhaps, the tribe of the _Hapalidæ_\r\n(Ouistitis and Tamarins).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOWLING MONKEYS.]\r\n\r\nTo the _Howling Monkeys_ we have found it convenient to refer in a\r\npreceding chapter, and it is almost needless to remind the reader that\r\nthey owe their distinctive name to their habit of assembling in the\r\nwoods, and startling the echoes with a chorus of unearthly noises. They\r\nchiefly inhabit New Grenada, Guiana, Brazil, and Paraguay, where, night\r\nand morning, their discordant orchestra strikes terror to the soul of\r\nthe unaccustomed traveller.\r\n\r\nI have already said that the tail of nearly all the American Cebidæ is\r\nlong and prehensile; that is, endowed with a peculiar faculty of winding\r\nor clinging round any object.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATELES CROSSING A RIVER.]\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Ateles_, or \"Spider Monkey,\" for example, it virtually\r\nforms a fifth limb, by whose agency the animal suspends himself in the\r\nair, and darts from one tree to another with more than the agility of a\r\nLeotard. It amply compensates for the imperfection with which Nature has\r\nafflicted him by leaving his fore-paws deprived of thumbs. He owes his\r\npopular designation of the Spider Monkey to his long slender limbs and\r\nsprawling gestures. In the colour of his skin, his methodical slowness,\r\nand the suppleness of his movements, he resembles the gibbons. Of all\r\nanimals he alone has the biceps of the thigh resembling that of man. He\r\nis fond of the society of his kind, and mainly subsists on insects,\r\nsmall fish, and molluscs, which he catches with all the address of a\r\npractised angler. Travellers affirm that he frequently crosses the wide\r\nAmerican rivers without descending to the ground. He and his comrades\r\nform a living chain, which hangs suspended from a lofty branch, and, by\r\na series of more or less nimble movements, succeeds in _hooking itself\r\non_ to a tree on the other side. This chain serves at first as a flying\r\nbridge for the whole troop; then it accomplishes its own passage, by\r\ndetaching itself from its point of suspension to fall back on the\r\nopposite bank. The tale, however, has an improbable air about it, which\r\nmakes a large demand on the reader's belief.\r\n\r\nIt is from South America, and notably from Brazil and Guiana, that we\r\nimport into Europe the apes most valued by our itinerant mountebanks and\r\nby zoological amateurs, on account of their gentleness, their\r\ndomesticity, their intelligence, and their singular instinct of\r\nimitation--almost amounting to genius--which renders them wonderfully\r\napt in the performance of all kinds of tricks and amusing exercises.\r\nNearly all these apes belong to the very numerous genus of _Sajous_, or\r\n_Sapajous_.\r\n\r\nThus we have the Squirrel Monkey (_Callithrix sciurus_), not much larger\r\nthan the animal whose name he bears, and infinitely more nimble and\r\ndiverting. He is of a bright golden yellow colour, with feet and hands\r\nof a deeper yellow. His head is round, with a blackish nose, and hairy\r\nears. His tail is very long, and tipped with black. The nails of his\r\nhands are flat, while those of his feet resemble claws.\r\n\r\nThe Ouistitis, which are frequently imported into Europe, are very\r\npretty animals, clad in a soft kind of fur, and with their ears\r\nornamented by long brush-like tufts of black or white hairs. They are\r\nvery easily tamed, are mild and intelligent, and, owing to their small\r\nsize, conveniently kept in apartments; but they do not acclimatize in\r\nEurope, and, even if they survive the voyage, die very shortly after\r\ntheir arrival.\r\n\r\nLinné has given the name of _Lemurs_, which modern naturalists have also\r\nadopted, to a race of quadrumanous animals approximating in many\r\nparticulars to the Monkey tribe, but forming, nevertheless, a perfectly\r\ndistinct zoological family. It comprises five genera: one, that of the\r\nGalagos, belongs to Africa; two inhabit India and the neighbouring\r\nislands--namely, the Loris and the Tarsii; and, finally, two others, the\r\nMakis and the Indris, are exclusively confined to Madagascar, where they\r\noccupy the same position as the Apes properly so called on the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe Galagos are distinguished by their great eyes, their large\r\nmembranous ears, which double down when the animal is at rest, their\r\nextraordinary long hind limbs, and their long and tufted tail. In size\r\nthey vary from that of a rat to that of a rabbit. The _Senegal Galagos_,\r\nor Gum animals of Senegal (_Galago Senegalensis_), have, at night, all\r\nthe activity of birds, hopping from bough to bough on their hind limbs\r\nonly. They watch the insects flitting among the leaves, listen to the\r\nfluttering moth as it darts through the air, and leap upon it with\r\narrow-like rapidity, seldom missing their prize, which is caught by the\r\nhands. Their nests are made in the branches of the trees, and they cover\r\na bed for their young with grass and leaves.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I say of the _Loris_? Two species only are known, and both\r\nare natives of the East Indian world: the Short-limbed Loris (_Lemur\r\ntardigradus_), and the Slender Loris (_Lemur gracilis_), the latter\r\nbeing readily recognized by the disproportionate length of his limbs,\r\nand, especially, of his fore-arms. They live in the trees; feeding on\r\ninsects, or, as a relish, on small birds and quadrupeds; and going forth\r\nat night in search of their prey. They have a short muzzle, slender\r\nbody, no tail, rough tongue, and large staring eyes, placed very near\r\neach other. Their ears are short, scarcely rising through the hair in\r\nwhich they are embedded; the nostrils project beyond the mouth, and are\r\nsurrounded by a naked muzzle; and the thumbs are widely separated from\r\nthe fingers, both on the fore and hinder hands.\r\n\r\nOf the _Tarsii_ it is enough to say that they are insectivorous, like\r\nthe loris, and that their hind limbs are similarly disproportionate. The\r\ntail is long and tufted; the large, fixed, glaring eyes mark them out as\r\naddicted to nocturnal habits. They leap about two feet at a spring, and\r\nby day conceal themselves under the roots of trees. Two species are\r\ndistinguished: the _Tarsius fuscomanus_ of Fischer, and the _Tarsius\r\nbancanus_ of Horsfield.\r\n\r\nThe _Makis_ approach the nearest of all the Lemuridæ to the superior\r\nQuadrumana. They have, however, like their congeners, opposite fingers\r\non the hind feet. The Short-tailed Indri bears even some slight\r\nresemblance to man, in the shortness of his tail, the length of his\r\nlegs, and his altitude. The Malagasy call him the \"Man of the Woods,\"\r\nalthough he has a pointed muzzle and trumpet-shaped ears on the summit\r\nof the head. He is the largest of the Lemuridæ, attaining, when erect,\r\nthe height of three feet. His skin is soft, and clothed in long fine\r\nhair; whence naturalists have named him _Indris laniger_. Very gentle in\r\ndisposition, he is easily tamed, although endowed with only moderate\r\nintelligence. It is said that he can be trained to the chase.\r\n\r\nThe Maki, like the Short-tailed Indri, has a thin elongated muzzle;\r\notherwise, in form, he approximates more closely to the Ratans or the\r\nCoatis than to the Apes. Their ears are small and round, lateral, and\r\nalmost entirely hidden in the hair; they carry a tail of notable length;\r\ntheir fur is thick and soft. The thumb of their anterior paws is nearly\r\nas \"opposable\" as that of the posterior. To sum up: they are graceful\r\nlittle animals, precisely because we do not find in them those grotesque\r\nfeatures and that eccentric conformation which render the apes, even the\r\nmost favoured by Nature, offensive caricatures of man. They are lively\r\nand agile; they climb, run, and leap with as much grace as nimbleness.\r\nTheir habits are nocturnal, as the development of their eyes\r\nsufficiently indicates. They subsist on fruits and insects. Their\r\nmanners are gentle; they accustom themselves to captivity with great\r\nreadiness, and soon grow familiar; but they do not equal the apes in\r\nintelligence. This genus comprehends several species. I shall specify\r\nthe _Maki-Mocoas_, which is of a cindery-gray, with the cheeks and\r\nthroat white, and the tail marked with regular black rings; the\r\n_White-Mantled Maki_, whose muzzle, shoulders, and tail are black, and\r\nthe rest of the body of a pure white; the _Red Maki_, very remarkable\r\nfor the brightness of his colours, for his body is of a lively red, the\r\nupper part of his neck and head white, as well as the extremities of his\r\nlegs; and, finally, his belly and tail are black. Other species have\r\nbeen distinguished, as the Red-bellied Maki, the Yellow-bellied, the\r\nMaki with the white forehead, and the like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Maki-Mocoas. 2. White-Mantled Maki.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the Fauna of the Madagascar forests also belongs an extremely rare\r\nanimal, few specimens of which have been brought into Europe. After some\r\nhesitation our naturalists have agreed to refer it to the order of\r\nPrimates, although its general appearance and its system of dentition\r\ncaused it at first to be taken for a kind of large squirrel; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the form and disposition of its thin fingers, and the\r\ndevelopment of its nails, liken it to the sloths. This animal is the\r\nAye-Aye, or _Cheiromys Madagascariensis_. The characters which have\r\ndetermined its annexations to the order of Primates are, principally,\r\nthe presence of opposable thumbs on the hind-paws; the terminal position\r\nof the nostrils; the oblique direction of the eyes, and the absence of a\r\nvertical fissure on the upper lip. Its habits are not well known; but it\r\nis a burrowing animal, very slothful, and goes abroad at night. It has\r\nlarge flat ears, like a bat's, and a tail like a squirrel's; but its\r\npeculiarity is the middle toe or finger of the fore-foot, whose two last\r\njoints are very long, slender, and destitute of hair. From nose to tail\r\nit measures about eighteen inches, and its general colour is a pale\r\nferruginous brown, mixed with gray.\r\n\r\nSonnerat, who discovered the aye-aye in his expedition to Madagascar, at\r\nthe close of the last century, succeeded in obtaining a couple of\r\nspecimens, which he kept alive for two months. \"I nourished them,\" he\r\nsays, \"upon cooked rice, and they make use, in eating, of the thin\r\nfingers of their fore-feet, just as the Chinese do of their chopsticks.\r\nThey seemed always drowsy, resting with the head placed between the\r\nfore-paws, and it was only by shaking them several times we could get\r\nthem to move.\" This torpid condition, however, was it the effect of\r\nconfinement or of natural apathy? If due to the latter, it would be\r\nanother point of approximation between the aye-aye and the sloths, which\r\nsome naturalists have also inclined to rank among the Primates.\r\n\r\nOther authors have placed those latter quadrupeds in an order apart,\r\nunder the name of \"Tardigrades;\" but most scientific zoologists now\r\nclassify them with the Edentata, and form them into the family of\r\nBradypes or Bradypidæ. Undoubtedly the sloth, or aï, is an animal of\r\ncurious and uncouth appearance; in general conformation not unlike the\r\nbear, to which he also approaches in the form of his head, and in\r\ndeficiency of tail, while his long rough hair, coarse and shaggy, like\r\ndry withered grass, recalls the fur of the ant-eater. The most singular\r\npeculiarity of his organization is the structure of the feet, whose\r\nstrong crooked claws, to the number of three or more in each limb, are\r\nso linked together that they cannot be moved separately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHEIROMYS, OR AYE-AYE OF MADAGASCAR.]\r\n\r\nThe name of \"Sloth\" popularly bestowed on this animal is not so\r\nwell-deserved as some writers of Zoology made Easy have represented. It\r\nis true that his progress on the ground is made with difficulty and\r\nslowness; but in the trees, his customary sojourn, he displays\r\nconsiderable address, and transports himself easily from tree to tree.\r\n\"He moves suspended from the branch,\" says Waterton, \"he rests suspended\r\nfrom the branch, and he sleeps suspended from the branch. Hence his\r\nseemingly bungled composition is at once accounted for; and in lieu of\r\nthe sloth leading a painful life, and entailing a miserable existence\r\nupon his progeny, it is but fair to conclude that he just enjoys life as\r\nmuch as any other animal, and that his extraordinary formation and\r\nsingular habits are but further proofs to engage us to admire the\r\nwonderful works of Omnipotence.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Lund says of the Three-toed Sloth (_Bradypus torquatus_) that he\r\nclimbs with remarkable sureness and aptitude. The manner in which he\r\nmoves is thus:--Lying on his belly, with all his four extremities\r\nstretched out from his body, he first presses one of his hind-feet with\r\nall its might against the ground, whereby the corresponding side of the\r\nbody is slightly raised. The fore-leg on the same side thus becomes\r\nsufficiently free for the animal to move it a little in advance. He then\r\nhooks his powerful claws fast in the earth, and so drags his body a\r\nlittle onwards. The same manoeuvre is next repeated on the opposite\r\nside; and thus the poor animal progresses in the slowest and most\r\nlaborious manner. But though his organization unfits him for terrestrial\r\nlocomotion, it is wonderfully adapted, as I have said, to climbing\r\ntrees. With his long arms he reaches high up, and clings fast to the\r\nbough with crooked claws. The _inverted_ position of the soles of his\r\nhind-feet gives him a power of _clutching_ the trunk of the tree which\r\nno other mammal possesses; so that truly when we see him climbing a\r\ntree, we can scarcely believe it to be the same animal that lies so\r\nhelpless on the ground. Hence we see that the sloth's organization is\r\nwholly adapted for living in trees. Compared with the slowness of his\r\nmotions, he is the best climber among mammals, while he is the worst\r\nwalker; or rather, he is the only mammal that can neither walk nor\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nThe Bradypes family is peculiar to South America. It includes but two\r\ngenera, whose types are the _Chalypus-Unau_ and the _Bradypus-Ai_. The\r\nUnau, or Two-toed Sloth, is found in the forests of Peru, Guiana, and\r\nColumbia. His length is from twenty to thirty inches. He has a large\r\nhead; long and dry hair, of a grayish-brown. During the day he sees very\r\nimperfectly, and therefore passes most of his time asleep upon a tree,\r\nwhere he may be seen clinging by three of his feet to a bough, and\r\nmaking use of the fourth to reach and convey to his mouth the food on\r\nwhich he lives. The Aï is more indolent in his habits than the Unau,\r\nfrom which he differs rather in his anatomical and osteological\r\ncharacteristics than in his aspect and conformation. He may, however, be\r\nrecognized by his rudimentary tail, his flattened visage, and the long\r\nfrizzled hair which covers certain parts of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Aï (Two-toed Sloth). 2. Unau (Three-toed Sloth).]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the aye-aye may be considered as connecting the\r\nQuadrumana with the Bradypes, on the one hand, and the squirrels on the\r\nother. These two groups, however, exhibit a very striking contrast\r\nbetween their habits and disposition; and since to animals of the former\r\nthe name has been given of \"Sloths,\" the latter might justly be\r\ndesignated \"the Active.\" If there exist, indeed, any animals for whom\r\n_movement_ is a vital necessity, these, assuredly, are the squirrels.\r\nThey climb trees with great agility, and leap from one branch to another\r\nwith a marvellous vigour and precision. On the ground, they trot rather\r\nthan run. They are essentially graminivorous and frugivorous; nuts,\r\nfruits, seeds, the young stems of trees, forming their chief\r\nnourishment, though at times they plunder birds' nests, and regale\r\nthemselves with the eggs or even the \"callow brood.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMON EUROPEAN SQUIRRELS.]\r\n\r\nThe Squirrel (_Sciurus_) belongs to the family _Sciuridæ_, in the order\r\nRodentia. Their special characteristics may be enumerated as a long\r\nbushy tail, generally carried curved over the body, whence the Greek\r\nname Skiouros ([Greek: skia], a shade, and [Greek: oura], a tail),\r\nfore-paws furnished with four toes, which have curved claws, and a\r\ntubercular thumb; long hind-legs, the feet provided with five toes; two\r\nincisors in each jaw; and four molar teeth on each side of each jaw,\r\nsimple, with tuberculous crowns, and a fifth in front of the upper jaw,\r\nwhich soon falls out. The squirrel's fur, thick and soft, is of a bright\r\nreddish-brown colour, more or less varied with gray; with a snow-white\r\nbelly and breast, and a tail brown, or almost black. The ears are\r\nornamented with long tufts of hair. The eyes, directed laterally, are\r\nblack and lively, shining with subdued mischief; the legs are short and\r\nmuscular; and when on the ground the animal moves by a succession of\r\nleaps, the tail being undulating and extended. He lives constantly in\r\nthe forest, selecting a particular tree, where he builds his nest,\r\neither in a hollow of the trunk or among the branches. In the latter\r\ncase he builds himself a sort of cabin, with twigs and stems, artfully\r\nconcealed beneath a covering of moss and fragments of bark. There he\r\nlives \"by his ain fireside,\" in the company of his mate and their young\r\nones, collecting an abundant magazine of nuts and acorns for their\r\nwinter provision. In the spring and summer he loves to gambol among the\r\nleafy boughs, climbing up and down the forest trees, and uttering a\r\nshort quick stuccato cry, like the sound which we produce by clacking\r\nthe tongue against the palate. If you attempt to seize him, he bites\r\nsharply, and scratches like a cat. He is nevertheless easily tamed, and\r\nhis engaging manners, his amusing gambols, and constant liveliness, make\r\nhim a great favourite among our \"domestic pets.\" He soon grows\r\naccustomed to his cage, and after a brief interval of liberty returns to\r\nit of his own accord.\r\n\r\nThe Common Squirrel (_Sciurus vulgaris_) is found all over Europe, North\r\nAmerica, and the Northern and Temperate regions of Asia. He is about\r\neight inches and a-half in length, without the tail, which measures\r\nfully six inches long. In Lapland and Sweden his colour changes to gray\r\nin the winter season; in the snowy wastes of Siberia, he is frequently\r\nseen of a pure white.\r\n\r\nThe only other European species is the Alpine Squirrel (_Sciurus\r\nAlpinus_), a native of the Alps and Pyrenees, of a deep brown colour,\r\nspeckled with yellowish-white.\r\n\r\nTo North America belongs the Gray Squirrel (_Sciurus Carolinensis_),\r\nwhere he enjoys his free and sportive life in the great forests of\r\nhickory, oak, maple, and chestnut. His whole length, including the tail,\r\nis about two feet. As he forays plentifully among the corn-fields, the\r\ninhabitants regard him as a scourge, and wage deadly war against him.\r\nLike the lemming, he migrates about autumn, in immense hosts; advancing\r\nin a straight course, which no obstacle is permitted to interrupt, and\r\nspreading desolation, like the course of an invading army.\r\n\r\nThe large species of the Fox Squirrel (_Sciurus vulpinus_) belongs\r\nexclusively to the \"murmurous pine-woods\" of South America. The Cat\r\nSquirrel (_Sciurus cinereus_) is remarkable for the exquisite fineness\r\nof his fur. In the neighbourhood of Hudson's Bay dwells the Red or\r\nHudson's Bay Squirrel (_Sciurus Hudsonius_), marked along the middle of\r\nthe back by a ferruginous line from head to tail, with the belly of a\r\npale ash-colour, mottled with black.\r\n\r\nIn the northern districts of Africa we meet with the Barbary Squirrel\r\n(_Sciurus getulus_), which dwells among the palm-trees, and is of a\r\ngrayish-brown colour, lightly shaded with red, with two white\r\nlongitudinal bands separated by a brown streak. Cross to the eastern\r\ncoast, and there we find the Abyssinian Squirrel, which has a\r\ngreenish-gray back, white belly, and tail ringed with black and white;\r\non the western side, the Ivory-eating Squirrel, which nibbles the tusks\r\nof elephants killed by hunters; and the Kendo Squirrel, one of the\r\nsmallest known. The two latter species were discovered and specified by\r\nM. Du Chaillu, who has named the former _Sciurus eborivorus_, and the\r\nlatter _Sciurus minutus_.\r\n\r\nAmong the Indian Squirrels I may name the great Malabar Squirrel\r\n(_Sciurus maximus_), less remarkable for his size, which is more than\r\ndouble that of the European Squirrel, than for the variety and vivacity\r\nof his colours. On the upper part of the head, the flanks, and thighs\r\nare of a chestnut purple; the shoulders, hind-quarters, and tail of a\r\nglossy black; the belly and inner sides of the limbs, a pale yellow.\r\n\r\nZoologists have classified in two genera, distinct from the true\r\nSquirrels, under the names of _Pteromys_ and _Sciuroptera_, the animals\r\npopularly called \"Flying Squirrels.\" The first of these genera is\r\nproper to Southern Asia; the second comprehends the species common to\r\nAsia and Eastern Europe, others which are exclusively Asiatic, and\r\nothers which are only met with in North America.\r\n\r\nThese Sciuridæ have no wings and no capacity of flight; but their\r\nanterior and posterior limbs are connected on either side by a membrane,\r\nwhich is really nothing but a fold of skin, and which they extend by\r\nspreading out their paws so as to present to the air a considerable\r\nsurface. By means of this kind of parachute, they can cross, by leaping\r\nfrom one tree to another, an extensive area. My space only permits me to\r\nallude to the Virginian Flying Squirrel (_Pteromys volucella_), and the\r\nCommon Flying Squirrel (_Pteromys volans_). The former is about five\r\ninches long, with a tail four inches; of a subferruginous brown colour\r\nabove, and a yellowish-white beneath; the edges of the flying membrane\r\nare of a deeper tint than the rest of the fur, contrasting with the\r\nwhite border of the under part. He is naturally of a gregarious\r\ndisposition, and ten or twelve may be seen in company, flying from tree\r\nto tree. In case of need he can swim like other quadrupeds, and yet, on\r\nquitting the water, can resume his aërial motion. He feeds on fruits,\r\nnuts, and young leaves and twigs; is of an affectionate nature, and\r\neasily domesticated.\r\n\r\nThe Common Flying Squirrel (_Pteromys volans_) belongs to the\r\nnorthernmost regions, and his favourite haunt is the pine and birch\r\nwoods of Siberia. On the upper parts his colour is a pale gray, on the\r\nunder a milky white. Measured from the nose to the tail, his length is\r\nsix inches; and the tail, which is thickly furred and slightly\r\nflattened, is somewhat shorter than the body. He flies, or rather\r\nsprings, through the agency of an expansile furry membrane, reaching, as\r\nI have stated, from the fore-feet to the hind. He builds his nest of the\r\nfinest mosses in the hollows of the old forest trees; is a solitary\r\nanimal emerging from his retreat only at the approach of the gloaming;\r\nfeeds on young buds and catkins; and springs from one tree to another\r\nwith astonishing velocity.\r\n\r\nThe _Pteromys splendens_ belongs to Java and Borneo: his body is clothed\r\nin fur of a warm red hue. The _Sciuroptera Polatouche_, which inhabits\r\nthe north of Europe and Asia, is of an ashen gray on the upper, and of a\r\nsnowy white on the inferior parts.\r\n\r\nSome species of _Sciuridæ_ seldom ascend trees, but burrow on the\r\nground, and are further distinguished by their possession of\r\ncheek-pouches. They form the genus _Tamias_. The best known is the\r\nChipping Squirrel, Hacker, or Chipmuck (_Tamias Lysteri_), which abounds\r\nin the United States as far north as the fiftieth parallel, and derives\r\nhis name from his peculiar _chipping_ or _cheeping_ cry, like that of a\r\nyoung chicken. He burrows near the roots of trees, and several squirrels\r\nfrequently tenant one burrow, where they lay up stores of nuts and grain\r\nfor winter supply. His length is fully ten inches; the general colour\r\ngray, longitudinally striped with yellowish-white and black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMAN IN THE SAVANNAHS AND THE FORESTS.--ANTHROPOPHAGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Steppes and Deserts of Sand we have seen men ignorant and wild,\r\nsemi-brutalized in manner and tastes, and miserable in condition: some\r\nsedentary and peaceful, cultivating with laborious care an ungrateful\r\nsoil; others, and by far the greater number, nomadic and pastoral in\r\ntheir habits; and others, again, living partly on the product of their\r\nherds, partly on the plunder obtained by a life of piracy. But between\r\nthese races and civilized nations there still exist some analogies of\r\nbelief, of polity, of social economy. In the sacred codes which fill,\r\nfor them, the place of our elaborate legal and political systems, lofty\r\nprecepts of justice and charity, salutary rules of morality and hygiène,\r\nmingle with barbarous customs and absurd or superstitious practices.\r\nTheir religions, founded, like Christianity itself, on the idea of a\r\nDivine unity, a God of mercy and punishment, they hold in common with\r\npeoples who have left their mark on the history of the world, and to\r\nwhom, moreover, they are attached by close ties of consanguinity.\r\n\r\nWidely different is the man of the Prairies and the Forests, the\r\n_Savage_, who even to our own days has remained plunged in the lowest\r\ndepths of social, intellectual, and moral development. Differing the one\r\nfrom the other, according to the country which they inhabit, the colour\r\nof the skin, the features of the countenance, and sometimes the forms\r\nand outlines of the body, savages everywhere approximate very closely in\r\nthe general character of their instincts, sentiments, and ideas, and\r\nrepresent to us that early condition of humanity from which it has only\r\nbeen elevated by the Divine impulse and for the Divine purposes.\r\n\r\nAssuredly it is not these whom Bonald has in view when he defines Man as\r\n\"an intelligence served by organs;\" for with them the respective parts\r\nof the mind and the body are inverted, and the first is the very humble\r\nservant of the second; its sphere of activity, accordingly, is very much\r\nrestricted. War, the chase, the coarse pleasures of the banquet, the\r\ndance--and what a wild, barbarous, sensual dance it is!--the recital and\r\nglorification of the deeds of their ancestors, their nation, and\r\nthemselves, mingled with marvellous improbabilities which he readily\r\naccepts for authentic histories, and finally, gambling--these are the\r\nonly pleasures of the savage.\r\n\r\nThe chase is almost his sole means of existence; for he is no shepherd,\r\nand still less is he a tiller of the ground. He contents himself with\r\ngathering those alimentary substances which Nature spontaneously pours\r\nout at his feet; and as, among these, the flesh of animals is that which\r\nhe prefers, he exerts all his physical faculties, and all the resources\r\nof his intelligence, to procure it. He fashions for himself arms; he\r\nlearns to handle them skilfully, as well as to follow up the scent of\r\nthe game, to contend with the wild beast in agility or cunning; and he\r\ndisplays in this exercise a courage, a patience, and an ardour augmented\r\nby the stimulus of vanity, which prompts every tribe and every\r\nindividual to claim the crown of superior bravery and the prize of\r\nsurpassing skill.\r\n\r\nFrom emulation to rivalry, from the chase to the campaign, there is but\r\none step. War, for the savage, is but a more dangerous and a more\r\nglorious chase; a chase more productive and more fertile in pleasures\r\nthan the ordinary chase. Therein his self-love, as well as his fierce\r\nsanguinary instincts, can be amply gratified; and he feels a keener\r\ndelight than in the pursuit of the lion or the tiger. He also derives\r\nfrom it far greater advantages, realizes far more considerable profits;\r\nthe likeness is moreover all the closer, since he looks upon his\r\nvanquished enemy sometimes as a prey, sometimes as a slave or a thing\r\nfor sale or barter. He may either kill him and eat him, or constrain him\r\nto labour for him; or finally sell him for money, or exchange him\r\nagainst other \"goods and chattels.\" If he does not cut him down on the\r\nbattle-field, and it should not suit him to let his captive live, he may\r\nenjoy the pleasure of varying and multiplying his tortures before he\r\ndeals the death-blow. Among all savage races no banquet is more eagerly\r\nenjoyed than the torture of their prisoners. It is generally round the\r\nstake to which the shuddering victims are confined, or their throbbing\r\nand bleeding remains, just about to be devoured, that the conquerors\r\nexecute fantastic dances, and surrender themselves to noisy\r\nmanifestations of joy, making the air re-echo with their discordant\r\nsongs and the not less discordant sounds of their rude musical\r\ninstruments; then after the hideous banquet--accursed as that which\r\nPelops offered to the gods--seated around the glowing embers, and in the\r\nmidst of the frightful fragments of the feast, they love to recall their\r\nachievements in the battle and the chase, or beguile the time with some\r\nrude game of chance. Gambling, like war and the chase, seems to be an\r\ninnate passion with savages; and, sooth to say, it is a vice worthy of\r\nthem and of their brutalized nature. Rightly does the poet exclaim,--\r\n\r\n                      \"What meaner vice\r\n    Crawls there than that which no affections urge,\r\n    And no delights refine; which from the soul\r\n    Steals mounting impulses which might inspire\r\n    Its noblest ventures, for the arid quest\r\n    Of wealth 'mid ruin; changes enterprise\r\n    To squalid greediness, makes heaven-born hope\r\n    A shivering fever, and in vile collapse\r\n    Leaves the exhausted heart, without one fibre\r\n    Impelled by generous passion?\"[178]\r\n\r\nThe \"shivering fever\" consumes the savage's very life-blood; he gives\r\nhimself up to it with unrestrained frenzy, and stakes, upon a throw of\r\nthe dice, his weapons, his possessions, his women, and even his liberty.\r\n\r\nScarcely less violent is the passion which plunges him into drunkenness.\r\nWith the fermented juices of various plants he is skilful in compounding\r\nintoxicating liquors, though he greatly prefers to these raw\r\npreparations the subtle mixtures introduced by Europeans. There is\r\nnothing which you cannot obtain from him for a few bottles of rum, of\r\nwhisky, or brandy. And it is to the shame of our merchants that they do\r\nnot scruple to stimulate, for their own sordid benefit, this vile\r\npassion to the utmost, against which the efforts of all our missionaries\r\nhave proved almost powerless; so that, in truth, the commerce of the\r\nsavage with civilized men, far from contributing to raise the former out\r\nof their abject, slothful, and degraded condition, has, on the contrary,\r\nproved for the majority of them a new source of embrutization and\r\ndepravity.\r\n\r\nSavages have no other literature than the traditions, myths, and marvels\r\nto which I have already alluded. They have no written language; and here\r\nwe are at once provided with a means of distinguishing the wholly savage\r\nfrom the partly civilized races. The reduction of speech to a definite\r\nsystem, the acknowledgment of certain laws and principles as affecting\r\nthe formation of a language, is the first great step out of barbarism\r\nwhich a barbarous people accomplishes.\r\n\r\nTheir science is limited to some acquaintance with the properties of the\r\nplants which they make use of, either as food, medicine, or poison.\r\nMedicine, indeed, as practised by \"medicine-men,\" priests, or\r\n\"sorcerers,\" consists practically of superstitious formulas, whose\r\nobject is to expel the \"evil spirit\" which the savage supposes to be the\r\ncause of all his maladies.\r\n\r\nThe logical faculties are invariably those which in man are developed\r\nthe most slowly and with the greatest difficulty. But they are also\r\nthose which constitute the intellectual power of great nations. Without\r\nAristotle, Plato, and Socrates, what had been ancient Hellas? Without\r\nBacon, Locke, Newton, and Stuart Mill, what were modern England? Or\r\nItaly, without Galileo? And France, without Pascal, Descartes, Diderot,\r\nand Montesquieu? And Germany, without Fichte, Hegel, Kant, and Schlegel?\r\nThe savage, however, possesses these faculties in a purely rudimentary\r\ncondition. Analysis, synthesis, abstraction, generalization, are mental\r\nachievements which they cannot accomplish. They show themselves\r\nincapable, in fact, of the simplest calculations, of resolving easy\r\narithmetical problems which are no mystery to the infants in our\r\nEuropean infant-schools. Their numeration never goes beyond the safe and\r\ncertain limit of their ten fingers; often they cannot compute above\r\nfive, three, and even two. The Guarinis employ the expression \"one hand\"\r\nand \"two hands\" to designate _five_ and _ten_; other American tribes say\r\n\"two men\" instead of _forty_, because each man has twenty toes and\r\nfingers. Among most of the African negroes, numeration is quinary; it is\r\nternary, or even binary, among the Australian aborigines. The savage\r\nknows nothing of art, nor of that feeling for beauty which is the\r\nessence of art. If he cultivates music, it is of so discordant a\r\ncharacter, and so incongruous a medley of sounds, that no European can\r\nlisten to it with patience. The gods which they fashion out of wood or\r\nclay, and to which they frequently offer human sacrifices, are of the\r\nutmost hideousness; and it is with difficulty the spectator can\r\nrecognize in their rude outlines any likeness, however imperfect, to the\r\nmodels in man or beast which the sculptor has pretended to imitate. The\r\nwant, or rather the depravation of taste, is shown in the choice of the\r\nornaments with which they decorate their persons; in the tatooings with\r\nwhich they bespatter their bodies; in the unbecoming ornaments of every\r\nkind which they suspend to the nose, the lips, the ears, and which\r\nrender monstrous the visage already ugly enough by nature.\r\n\r\nThe savage has no \"industries\" in the sense which we attach to that\r\ncomprehensive word; the terms \"trade,\" \"business,\" \"profession,\" possess\r\nno equivalents in his language. He builds himself a hut, a cabin, or a\r\nwigwam; and he fabricates for his use a few indispensable implements,\r\nweapons, and utensils. The only profession recognized among savage\r\npeoples is that of the priesthood. Priests, indeed, are everywhere found\r\nas the teachers and ministers of a religion--if we are willing to bestow\r\nthat sacred word on an incongruous mass of superstitious practices and\r\nbeliefs, founded upon some dim idea of the existence of a Supreme Being.\r\nAnd this idea exists, though very faintly and rudely, and mingled with\r\nmany atrocious or absurd aberrations, among most of the red-skins of\r\nNorth America and the islanders of Polynesia. These races believe in the\r\npower of a superior God, whom the former denominate the \"Great Spirit,\"\r\n_Kitchi Manitou_, and the latter _Taoroa_ or _Tangara_; as well as in\r\nanother life, a coarse and sensual immortality, wherein they hope to\r\nenjoy the full measure of those animal delights which constitute their\r\nideal of perfect happiness. The conception which the savage forms of his\r\nGod is, nevertheless, a very poor and imperfect one. He never connects\r\nhim with his thoughts, his emotions, his moral or intellectual nature;\r\nbut only with the material world--with the thunder and the lightning,\r\nthe sunshine and the cloud. \"Who is it,\" says the Indian, \"that causes\r\nthe rain to rise in the high mountains, and to empty itself into the\r\nocean? Who is it that causes to blow the loud winds of winter, and that\r\ncalms them again in the summer? Who is it that rears up the shade of\r\nthose lofty forests, and blasts them with the quick lightning at his\r\npleasure?\" And so the Polynesian employs his priest to propitiate his\r\nGod with sacrifices when the storm rages; and the African, after a\r\nprolonged drought, engages the intercession of his \"rain-maker\" to\r\nobtain the desired showers. It is not a moral and a spiritual, but a\r\n_material_ God, of whom the savage conceives, and before whose anger he\r\ntrembles.\r\n\r\nIn some regions of South America, and principally in Peru, man worships\r\nthe sun as his supreme divinity, and it is easy to understand the awe\r\nand wonder with which the uncultivated mind would necessarily look upon\r\nthe orb of day, the master and ruler of the year. With Southey, I find\r\nmyself ready to exclaim:--\r\n\r\n    \"I marvel not, O Sun, that unto thee\r\n     In adoration man should bow the knee,\r\n     And pour the prayer of mingled awe and love;\r\n     For like a god thou art, and on thy way\r\n     Of glory sheddest, with benignant ray,\r\n     Beauty, and life, and joyaunce from above.\"\r\n\r\nWe know, too, that sun-worship has prevailed among the most highly\r\ncivilized races, and that it was the basis of Greek, Egyptian, Celtic,\r\nand Oriental mythologies. \"Our northern natures,\" says Mr. Helps,[179]\r\nreferring to the influence of this religion of the outer world, \"can\r\nhardly comprehend how the sun and the moon and the stars were imaged in\r\nthe heart of a Peruvian, and dwelt there; how the changes in these\r\nluminaries were combined with all his feelings and his fortunes; how the\r\ndawn was hope to him; how the fierce mid-day brightness was power to\r\nhim; how the declining sun was death to him; and how the new morning was\r\na resurrection to him: nay, more, how the sun and the moon and the stars\r\nwere his personal friends, as well as his deities; how he held communion\r\nwith them, and thought that they regarded every act and word; how, in\r\nhis solitude, he fondly imagined that they sympathized with him; and\r\nhow, with outstretched arms, he appealed to them against their own\r\nunkindness, or against the injustice of his fellow-man.\" But such a\r\ncreed as this is indicative of some degree of advancement, of some\r\nmodicum of civilization, and may not be compared with the monstrous\r\nfetichism prevailing in Melanesia, Australia, Africa, and the Polar\r\nDeserts. In these regions the savage takes for the objects of his\r\nveneration beasts and inanimate objects; or is without any definite\r\nbelief, and shows himself refractory to all religious teaching. Such is\r\nthe case, according to Sir John Ross, among the Eskimos; while the\r\nAustralians, according to Latham, have not even succeeded in formulating\r\nthe rudest elements of a mythology; and the negroes of Equatorial Africa\r\nindulge in horrible superstitions which are a hundredfold worse than the\r\nabsence of all belief.\r\n\r\nThe individuals, therefore, who act as priests among these ignorant and\r\nstupid savages are, in reality, only miserable sorcerers, to whom they\r\nattribute the power of predicting the future, of controlling wind and\r\nrain, the sun and the moon, of curing disease, either by magic potions,\r\nincantations, or amulets; but they fear without respecting them, and\r\nnever hesitate to put them to death when the effect of their juggleries\r\nor their prophecies does not respond to the hopes cherished by the\r\nworshippers.\r\n\r\nAmong these credulous and cruel peoples we find the realization of all\r\nthose terrible dreams embodied by the poet in his picture of the\r\ninfluences and consequences of superstition. For a vivid commentary on\r\nthe following lines of Pope, the reader should turn to the pages of\r\nLivingstone, Burton, Speke, Du Chaillu, William Ellis, John Williams, or\r\nAdmiral Wilkes. Of superstition, the poet says:[180]--\r\n\r\n    \"She taught the weak to bend, the proud to pray\r\n     To powers unseen, and mightier far than they:\r\n     She, from the rending earth and bursting skies,\r\n     Saw gods descend, and fiends infernal rise;\r\n     Here fixed the dreadful, there the blessed abodes:\r\n     Fear made her devils, and weak hope her gods:\r\n     Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust,\r\n     Whose attributes were rage, revenge, or lust;\r\n     Such as the souls of cowards might conceive,\r\n     And, formed like tyrants, tyrants would believe.\r\n     Zeal, then, not charity, became the guide;\r\n     And hell was built on spite, and heaven on pride.\r\n     Then sacred seemed the ethereal vault no more;\r\n     Altars grew marble then, and reeked with gore;\r\n     Then first the flamen tasted living food;\r\n     Next his grim idol smeared with human blood;\r\n     With heaven's own thunders shook the world below,\r\n     And played the god an engine on his foe.\"\r\n\r\nThe savage has only rudimentary notions of the justice, the respect, and\r\nthe good-will which man owes to his fellows. Nevertheless, if in some\r\nparts of the world he appears an intractable, cruel, and perfidious\r\nbeing, in others his manners are gentle, inoffensive, and hospitable.\r\nAnd nearly everywhere he seems capable of gratitude, devotion, and even\r\nof veritable heroism. But, in general, the law of the strongest is the\r\nonly law which he recognizes; the fear of an immediate and corporeal\r\nchastisement is the sole restraint upon his passions; and the material\r\ninstincts are the most powerful impulses of his actions. The want or\r\nnarrowness of the moral sense induces as its natural consequences among\r\nthe unfortunate savages every form of debauchery--the absolute and\r\nbrutal tyranny of the chief over his tribe, of man over woman, of the\r\nfather over his children, of the conqueror over the conquered; murder on\r\nthe slightest occasion, and with incredible refinements of cruelty; and,\r\nfinally, anthropophagy--that hideous custom which lowers man below the\r\nmost ferocious beasts, and which, nevertheless is not always, as might\r\nbe supposed, the sign of the lowest abasement.\r\n\r\nAnthropophagy springs from different causes, and clothes itself in\r\nvarious forms. Sometimes it is but the expression of a sanguinary\r\ninstinct, of an atrocious sentiment of vengeance; sometimes it is the\r\nconsequence of a state of misery and of famine almost permanent; often,\r\nalso, it is closely connected with the usage of human sacrifices, and\r\nthose who practise it consider it as a sacred duty, as an act of piety,\r\nagreeable to their divinities or to the _manes_ of the victims whose\r\nvery flesh they devour.\r\n\r\nUnknown to the stupid Eskimos, and in general to all hyperborean races,\r\nanthropophagy rages with intensity among peoples comparatively\r\ncivilized. The Ghonds of Hindostan, peaceful and laborious cultivators,\r\nare not exactly cannibals, but every year they immolate to their\r\ndivinities a multitude of children, whom they flay and cut to pieces\r\nwhile alive, and whose flesh they distribute in fragments over the\r\nfields they are about to sow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CANNIBAL FEAST AMONG THE BATTAS OF SUMATRA.]\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra there exists a tribe, that of the Battas, which has not\r\nonly a religion and a worship, but a kind of constitution, a literature,\r\nand a penal code. This code condemns certain classes of criminals to be\r\n_eaten alive_. After the sentence has been pronounced by the competent\r\ntribunal, two or three days are suffered to elapse in order to give the\r\npeople time to assemble. On the appointed day the criminal is led to the\r\nplace of execution, and bound to a stake. The offended party, or his\r\nnearest relation, if he has been murdered, advances and chooses the\r\nchoicest morsel; the others follow in their turn, and with their own\r\nhands cut off such pieces as please their fancy. Finally, the\r\nunfortunate wretch is relieved from his sufferings by the chief, who\r\nstrikes off his head. The flesh is eaten on the spot, raw or cooked,\r\naccording to each man's taste.\r\n\r\nThe natives of some of the Polynesian Islands consider that they render\r\na service to their aged parents by slaying them, and that, by eating\r\nthem, they provide the most honourable mode of sepulture. Others believe\r\nthat a man, by devouring his enemy, infiltrates into his blood all the\r\nvirtues with which the latter was endowed. A similar prejudice exists\r\namong certain tribes on the Amazon.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond doubt that, in a majority of cases, anthropophagy\r\noriginates in scarcity of food, in the lack of cattle and game, while,\r\nin others, many cannibals are attracted by the delicious savour of human\r\nflesh, which they prefer to every other. Among the _Cobens_ of the\r\nUanpès, says Maury, man is considered as veritable game, and these\r\nsavages declare war against the neighbouring tribes only with the object\r\nof procuring a supply of human flesh. When they have more than they\r\nrequire for present needs, they dry it, smoke it, and store it away as\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\nIn the Viti Islands, whose natives are eulogized by Dumont-d'Urville as\r\nthe most intelligent in Melanesia, great festivals are celebrated at\r\ndifferent epochs of the year, which require a certain number of victims.\r\nPrisoners of war are the first to be immolated; then all those\r\nunfortunates who are without an asylum are hunted and collected; and if\r\nthis inhuman chase should not be sufficiently productive, the purveyors\r\neke out the supplies by adding some wretched women, who are eaten by\r\ntheir own relatives. Dumont-d'Urville speaks of a chief, named Tanoa,\r\nwho, for a public banquet, caused thirty women to be slain, and their\r\nkin, far from murmuring or lamenting, took part in the hideous feast.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, Captain Burton saw, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, a\r\ncannibal people, named the Vouabembés, who feed upon carrion, vermin,\r\nlarvæ, and insects, and carry their sluggishness and brutality to such\r\nan extreme as to eat raw and putrid human flesh. Although you may see on\r\nevery countenance, says this adventurous traveller,[181] the expression\r\nof chronic hunger, the poor wretches, timid, fuliginous, stunted,\r\ndegraded, seem far more dangerous enemies to the dead than to the\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nOwing to the exertions of our missionaries, this horrible practice,\r\nagainst which our better nature instinctively rebels, is rapidly dying\r\nout in every region where their beneficial influence extends. In\r\nPolynesia and New Zealand, for instance, cannibalism is almost extinct.\r\nAnd if we owed no other service to the self-denying exertions of the\r\nsoldiers of the Cross, this alone would entitle them to our gratitude,\r\nfor the extermination of anthropophagy is the first step towards\r\nteaching man to reverence man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMAN IN THE SAVANNAHS AND THE FORESTS--THE SAVAGE RACES--THE NEGROES.\r\n\r\n    \"When wild in woods the untutored savage ran.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSavagery is evidently the primitive condition of man. But while for\r\ncertain races it has only been the first period of a more or less rapid\r\nprogressive evolution, a movement in advance more or less complete, for\r\nothers it seems to be a perpetual infancy, an incurable atrophy of the\r\nnoble faculties which are the privilege of our species. It is not the\r\nprovince of the present writer to determine the causes, undoubtedly very\r\ncomplex, which have operated in the formation of the various races\r\ncomposing the human genus, to allot to each the physiological and\r\npsychological characteristics which distinguish them, and to explain\r\ntheir distribution in the different regions of the globe. These are\r\nproblems, indeed, which science has only begun to investigate, and in\r\nwhose discussion scientific men exhibit the widest discrepancies of\r\nopinion. While one authority contends for man's unity of origin, another\r\nbelieves that he has sprung from several independent sources. All at\r\npresent is hypothesis and conjecture; nor do there apparently exist any\r\nwell-approved facts on which a satisfactory theory can be erected apart\r\nfrom the brief and succinct details recorded in Holy Writ. Why one race\r\nhas emerged from barbarism while another remains sunk in its lowest\r\ndepths, we can only explain by admitting the exercise of a superhuman\r\npower. No evidence can be given that any people has achieved\r\ncivilization by its own unassisted efforts. But in these pages I am not\r\ncalled upon to enter into any philosophical speculations. I have only to\r\ndeal with facts; and with one incontestable fact, the superiority of\r\nthose races which have acquired civilization over those which are\r\nincapable of so grand a work, and which show little, if any, aptitude to\r\nprofit by the examples and the lessons brought within their reach.\r\n\r\nWhether it is due to wholly external circumstances, such as climate,\r\ngeographical situation, geological constitution of the soil, its nature\r\nand that of its productions, that such differences should exist between\r\ndifferent races, that some should reign as sovereigns over the earth,\r\nwhile others, in their pretended liberty, are given up to all the\r\nhorrors of slavery, ignorance, misery, and cannibalism, I am not called\r\nupon to determine. It seems both probable and possible. \"To understand\r\nany people thoroughly,\" says Mr. Helps, \"we must know something of the\r\ncountry in which they live, or at least of that part inhabited by the\r\ndominant race. The insects partake the colour of the trees they dwell\r\nupon, and man is not less affected by the place of his habitation on\r\nthe earth.\" We cannot pretend to undervalue the importance of race. We\r\ncannot deny that one is the ruler, the other the ruled. As Emerson\r\nsays,[182] \"It is race, is it not? that puts the hundred millions of\r\nIndia under the dominion of a remote island in the north of Europe. Race\r\nis a controlling influence in the Jew, who, for two millenniums, under\r\nevery climate, has preserved the same character and employments.\" It is\r\nrace that has planted the Anglo-Saxon on every shore, and that for ages\r\nhas subjected the negro to the yoke of bondage. At all events, it is\r\ncertain that, even in the present day, savagery is the exclusive portion\r\nof certain races, perfectly distinct in a physiological point of view\r\nfrom the white and yellow races (the Caucasian and Mongolian), which,\r\neither in antiquity or the modern age, have arrived at more or less\r\nadvanced degrees of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe savage races may be divided into four great groups:--\r\n\r\nThe _Negro_, in Africa and North America;\r\n\r\nThe _Malayo-Polynesian_, in Polynesia and the Indian islands.\r\n\r\nThe _American_, or Red Indians; and\r\n\r\nThe _Hyperborean_, chiefly represented by the Eskimos.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Negro_ or _Black_ races are distributed over the whole of Africa,\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope to the frontiers of the Saharan region. The\r\nname of Negro is also given to the natives of Australia and Papouasia.\r\nBut most anthropologists agree in considering the Australian branch\r\nwholly distinct from, and independent of, the African branch; which,\r\nnevertheless, it resembles in several organic peculiarities, and\r\nespecially in the deep colour of the skin.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic, which is the most conspicuous at the first glance,\r\nis, however of secondary importance: it is extremely marked on the east\r\nAfrican coast, among the Nubians and the Abyssinians; on the banks of\r\nthe Cuzamance, not far from the Sierra Leone coast, among the Feloupas,\r\nand on the Guinea coast, among the Aminas. All these peoples are black\r\nas ebony; but their oval countenances, their regular features, the\r\nelegance of their forms and the development of their faculties,\r\nevidently connect them, some with the Semites, others with the\r\nAryan-Hindus.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, several varieties of Negroes properly so-called wear\r\nbut a fuliginous or reddish-brown tint. It is, therefore, by less\r\nsuperficial peculiarities that we distinguish the true Negro. His skull\r\nis elongated, and laterally compressed. Sometimes his jaw projects, a\r\ncharacteristic scientifically designated by the name of prognathism;\r\nsometimes it is more vertically disposed, but then the cheek-bones (or\r\n\"zygomathic arches\") are extremely prominent. His teeth project; that\r\nis, they are inclined outward, and always long and white. The skeleton,\r\nwhiter than our own, is also heavier and more massive. The abdomen is\r\nexceedingly narrow, and with a conical cavity; the legs are bowed. Short\r\nthe neck, broad the thorax, and convex, and generally well made. The\r\nmuscles, but slightly developed in proportion to the dimensions of the\r\nosseous framework, have not the vivid red colour which distinguishes the\r\nflesh of the European; the blood is black, thick, and circulates slowly.\r\nThe body is always deprived of hair; there is little or no beard; the\r\nhair of the head is black, woolly, and frizzled. The eyes are of the\r\ndeepest black, but inexpressive. The forehead is low, the chin short,\r\nthe mouth large, the lips are long and thick. Finally, and this is the\r\nmost remarkable sign of the Negro's inferiority, the type of the face,\r\nin the same race, is so uniform that it is difficult to distinguish one\r\nindividual from another. To this physical uniformity corresponds a moral\r\nand intellectual uniformity, which effaces, so to speak, all\r\nindividuality. In Africa we meet with numerous tribes more or less\r\nintelligent and capable of being educated, many sanguinary and fierce,\r\nothers benevolent and inoffensive; but the character and dispositions of\r\na tribe are reproduced among all the individuals who compose it with\r\nscarcely perceptible differences.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes of Africa may be divided into three principal varieties: the\r\npure Negroes, the Kaffirs, and the Hottentots. The former comprehends\r\nall the populations of the east, centre, and west of Africa. Its\r\nprimitive stock is supposed to be the people called Mandinké or Malinké\r\n(Mandingue), formerly established at Mendé, in the delta of the Nile,\r\nbut who emigrated towards the western coast, and now inhabit the\r\nmountainous countries bordering on the Upper Senegal. Between this river\r\nand the Niger are grouped some tribes in whom the Berber or Semitic\r\nblood appears mingled with the Negro blood; such are the Yolofs, the\r\nFoulahs, and the Peulas, or Fellatahs. The latter are of a sooty black,\r\nwith a well-shaped head, a square frontal development, thick and woolly\r\nhair. They have founded powerful states, and are considered as the true\r\ncivilizers of the Soudan, where they have introduced Islamism.\r\n\r\nFurther south, at the Gaboon, we meet with the wholly savage nations of\r\nthe Mpongwes, the Shekianis, and the Fans. The Mpongwes inhabit the\r\nright bank of the Gaboon, spreading over an extent of seventy to eighty\r\nmiles. They are of a medium height, and comparatively agreeable\r\nphysiognomy. The men are clothed in a calico shirt, and wrap themselves\r\nin an ample piece of stuff as a mantle. Their head-dress is a simple\r\nstraw-hat; but the king, as a sign of his dignity, wears a hat of silk.\r\nThe women have no other garment than close-fitting drawers descending to\r\nthe knee; but they decorate their arms and legs with copper rings. Great\r\namateurs are both sexes of tinsel and perfumery, and they besprinkle\r\nthemselves with all kinds of essences. According to Du Chaillu, their\r\ncharacteristic trait is their passionate ardour for trade. Their\r\nprincipal wares are ivory, precious woods, and slaves. They display in\r\ntheir commercial manoeuvres great ability jointed to the most signal\r\nbad faith.\r\n\r\nThe Shekianis occupy, between the banks of the Muni and La Mondah, and\r\nthose of the Ogobay, a territory which stretches to within some two\r\nhundred miles of the sea. Their appearance is less prepossessing than\r\nthat of the Mpongwes. Perfidious warriors, artful traders, bold and\r\nastute hunters; such are the salient traits of their character. As for\r\nthe Fans, they are cannibals of the worst species, whose appetite for\r\nhuman flesh leads them even to eat individuals who have died of disease,\r\nand to disinter the dead in order to roast or smoke them. When human\r\nflesh fails amongst them, they buy or steal it from their neighbours.\r\nThey are, however, according to M. Du Chaillu, the handsomest and most\r\ngallant-looking negroes of the interior, and their horrible diet seems\r\nto fatten and strengthen them. Living in the mountains, they have that\r\nbold free air which distinguishes all mountaineers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEGROES--NATIVES OF KIDI, AFRICA]\r\n\r\nThe Negro type is seen in all its purity among the populations of Congo,\r\nNigritia, the Soudan, Dahomey, and Timbuctu, as well as among those of\r\nthe eastern coast, below the tenth parallel of north latitude. In the\r\nregion of the great lakes, between the coast of Zanguebar and the Lakes\r\nVictoria-Nyanza and Tanganyika, lie the kingdoms of Ugogo, Unyamezi,\r\nUnyoro, Kidi, and others, visited by Grant and Speke in their\r\ncelebrated journey to the sources of the Nile. The inhabitants of these\r\ncountries are \"darkly, deeply, beautifully\" black, with prominent jaws,\r\nthick lips, and oblique eyes. Some of them, as, for instance, those of\r\nUnyoro, show a certain amount of taste in their accoutrements, and drape\r\nthemselves in the Romanesque manner with folds of cotton or calico.\r\nThose of Kidi wear no other clothing than an apron round the loins; they\r\ncarry large rings on the arms, legs, and neck; and arrange their hair in\r\nsufficiently complicated tresses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAFFIR WARRIORS.]\r\n\r\nThe Kaffir and Hottentot races are spread over all Southern Africa,\r\nbelow the fourteenth degree of south latitude; the former on the east,\r\nthe latter on the west coast.\r\n\r\nIn the hierarchy of races, the Kaffirs occupy a rank superior to that\r\nof the Negroes of Equatorial Africa. They have neither the pronounced\r\ntint nor the broad flat nose of the blacks of Guinea and the Soudan.\r\nThey form great nations, build towns, cultivate the land, and work in\r\nmetals. Their stock throws off four branches: the handsomest and most\r\ncultured is that of the Zulus, whose hue is not darker than that of the\r\nArabs, and of whom the Wanikas offer the most conspicuous type. Then\r\nfollow the south Kaffir branch, including the Amacondas and the\r\nAma-Hupubas; the Sofaloa branch, whose type most nearly approaches the\r\npure Negro race; finally, the Kaffir-Hottentot branch, which comprehends\r\nthe Makololos, the Bakonis, the Basoutos, the Batouas, the Damaras,\r\npeople of a clear brown hue, who have migrated from the north to the\r\nsouth, driving before them or subjugating the Hottentots, with whom they\r\nhave intermixed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOTTENTOTS--A MAN AND WOMAN.]\r\n\r\nThe Hottentot race, or Quaiqua, is characteristic of Southern Africa.\r\nIts origin appears of remote antiquity; but it formerly dwelt further to\r\nthe north, and has been driven back towards the south by the progress of\r\nthe more warlike Kaffirs. The Hottentots are of low stature; their skin\r\nis a yellowish-brown. Their head is long, with projecting forehead and\r\ncheek-bones; flat nose, thick lips. Their women are hideous in face and\r\ndeformed in body; as they grow old they grow stout, and a truly\r\nmonstrous _embonpoint_ invades the posterior part of their person.\r\nMorally, they are in an abject condition, which must be attributed\r\nrather to their sloth and wretchedness than to any lack of intelligence.\r\nTheir sole garment is the _carross_, a kind of sheepskin mantle. They\r\nlive in such low huts that they can only enter them by crawling. Some\r\nHottentot tribes cultivate the soil, or depasture herds of cattle; such\r\nare the Bayéyés, established on the banks of Lake Ngami; the Namaquas,\r\nwho are distinguished into \"the great\" and \"the little;\" and the\r\nKoranas, who roam along the Orange River. The most miserable members of\r\nthis family are the _Bosjesmans_, or _Bushmen_, who inhabit the Kalahari\r\nDeserts, between the Cape Colony and Kaffraria. The total number of the\r\nHottentot race probably does not exceed 150,000.\r\n\r\nI have said that the Negroes of Australia and Papouasia were wholly\r\ndistinct from those of Africa. And, in fact, I can hardly admit that it\r\ncould ever have been possible for the latter to colonize the Australian\r\ncontinent and the adjacent islands. What, then, is the origin of the\r\nAustralians and the Papuans? According to some anthropologists, they are\r\ndescended from that strange race of savages which still exists in\r\nHindostan, in the Nielgherries, and the Téraï, between Palmoco,\r\nSumbhulpoor, and the sources of the Nerbudda. But whence came the\r\nlatter? On this subject all historical tradition is dumb, and science\r\nknows not what to think of those black-skinned savages, with the face of\r\nan ape, a body covered with red hair, disproportionably long arms, a\r\nprotuberant belly, and who live in the trees like the orangs and the\r\ngibbons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUSTRALIANS.]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be its origin, the Pelagian Negro race now-a-days occupies\r\nNew Holland, Tasmania, New Caledonia, New Britain, New Guinea, the Fiji\r\nIslands, and the Andaman. It comprehends the Australians, the Papuans,\r\nthe Andamanese, the Alfourous, and some other secondary branches. We\r\noften, but erroneously, confound the Australians and Papuans. While both\r\nare black, they differ markedly from one another, and the latter are\r\nsuperior to the former. The Australians are puny and wretched in\r\nappearance. They have a protuberant belly, feeble limbs, a long but not\r\nprojecting face, a depressed skull, long black frizzled hair. Their\r\nattire is remarkable for its simplicity: a kangaroo skin flung over the\r\nright shoulder! The custom of painting and tatooing the body is\r\ngenerally adopted among them, as well as among all savages, to whatever\r\nrace they belong, and whatever part of the world they inhabit. The\r\ntribes are distinguished by the colours they make use of, and by the\r\nnumber and arrangement of the incisions which the warriors make on their\r\nlimbs, their chest, and their shoulders. Their arms are spears pointed\r\nwith heads of jagged flint, and hatchets of the same material. The\r\nindigenous population of Australia is rapidly decreasing; it does not\r\nexceed a total of 3000 souls. In Tasmania the aborigines are reduced to\r\nfour, three aged women, and a young man, who has recently visited\r\nEngland.[183]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPUANS.]\r\n\r\nThe Papuans have not woolly hair, like the Australians. Their hair grows\r\nin separate plaits, which twine one in another, and form, when of some\r\nlength, a voluminous and characteristic _coiffure_. The Papuans of New\r\nGuinea, according to Dumont d'Urville, are men of medium stature, with\r\nelegant forms, oval countenance, and tolerably regular features. Their\r\nskin is of a dark brown colour. They appear to be of a timid and\r\nunenterprising character. Their residence they have planted on the\r\nshores of the sea, where they dwell in long wooden huts, raised upon\r\npiles which are plunged deep in the very waters of ocean. It does not\r\nseem that they acknowledge the authority of any chiefs. They know only a\r\nfew words of the Malayan language, and speak the _papoua_, which differs\r\nfrom it essentially.\r\n\r\nThe Andamanese, or Andamans, are of a jet-black colour. Their stature\r\nrarely exceeds four and a half to five feet. Their head is large, and\r\nsunken between the shoulders; their hair woolly; most of them are\r\ndisfigured by protuberant stomach and meagre lower limbs. They go about\r\nin an absolute nudeness, for we cannot regard as any species of clothing\r\nthe coat of clay or yellow ochre which they plaster over their bodies to\r\nprotect them against the stings of insects; the red ochre which the\r\nearth supplies them they make use of to powder their hair and paint\r\ntheir face. According to the latest estimates, the total population of\r\nthe Andaman Islands does not exceed 2000 individuals.\r\n\r\nThe Alfourous, or Harfourous, inhabit Borneo, the Celebes, the Moluccas,\r\nMindanao, and some other isles. Their type has no very definite\r\npeculiarity, and ethnologists seem agreed to consider them a mixed race,\r\nresulting from a cross between the Papuans and the Malays, and forming\r\nthe transition between the two races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMAN IN THE SAVANNAHS AND THE FORESTS:--THE MALAYO-POLYNESIANS--THE NORTH\r\nAMERICAN INDIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Malayo-Polynesian race has also been designated, and much more\r\nfelicitously, the Neptunian or Pelagian, because it peoples exclusively\r\nthe peninsulas and islands of the great Southern Ocean. It is, to speak\r\nthe truth, an ill-defined, heterogeneous, and composite race, presenting\r\nvery diverse types. Ethnologists, however, divide it into two original\r\nbranches--the Malayan and the Polynesian.\r\n\r\nThe Malays have the skull flattened in the inferior portion, the malar\r\nbones very wide apart, a flat nose, an exceedingly wide mouth, thick\r\nlips, and eyes raised in the direction of the temples; their yellow skin\r\nembrowns by exposure to the sun, but if sheltered from its rays, grows\r\nalmost white, especially with the females. Generally speaking, they are\r\ncorrupt, sanguinary, and perfidious, as our seamen wrecked upon their\r\nshores have too frequently experienced; but they are intelligent, and\r\ncapable of a certain degree of civilization. The best marked types of\r\nthis race are found in Sumatra, among the anthropophagous Battas already\r\nspoken of, the Orang-Lobous, and the Pagais. The latter tatoo the body,\r\nsays Maury,[184] and like the Nagas of Assam, make new marks every time\r\nthey have killed a foe; thus bearing about on their own persons the\r\nevidences and glorification of their prowess. Like the Michmis of Assam,\r\nthey expose their dead on rudely-constructed scaffolds or platforms,\r\nwhere they leave them to decay; a custom which prevails amongst nearly\r\nall the Polynesian populations, as well as among the Redskins of North\r\nAmerica. We must therefore conclude that the Malayan race was, at the\r\noutset, extremely barbarous. It owes its civilization to the influence\r\nof the Hindus, and especially to that of the inhabitants of the Malabar\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThis civilization, in all its conditions, the Malays appear to have\r\ntransported to Madagascar, where they have formed, by intermixture with\r\nthe Negroes of Africa, two new races--the Hovas, who still preserve\r\ndistinctly visible affinities with the Negroes properly so called, and\r\nthe Sakalaves, who approximate towards the Kaffirs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALAYS--MALE AND TWO FEMALES.]\r\n\r\nThese two mixed races comprise in themselves several varieties, but all\r\nbear the common denomination of Malagasy or Madecassy.[185]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOVAS OF MADAGASCAR--MEN, WOMAN, AND CHILD.]\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Maury, the populations of Polynesia depart the more\r\ncompletely from the Malayan type as we advance in an eastward\r\ndirection; so that, from the Caroline Islands to the Marquesas, and from\r\nthe Sandwich Islands to New Zealand, they constitute a sufficiently\r\nhomogeneous race, the Polynesians or _Kanaks_.[186] This race is\r\nrepresented in the Sandwich Islands by an almost white variety, whose\r\ntype very closely approaches the Caucasian race; in New Zealand, on the\r\nother hand, by tribes of a dark brown. In the island of Ombaï, situated\r\nat the extremity of that vast archipelago which seems in some remote age\r\nto have formed an isthmus connecting the Australian with the Asiatic\r\ncontinent, the natives are of a more or less decided olive-brown. Their\r\neyes are deep-set and brilliant, their lips thick, the mouth is large,\r\nand the nose generally flat, yet sometimes tolerably well made. They are\r\nof medium height, robust, and good figures. They wear a scanty beard, if\r\nany; but their hair is long and thick; sometimes they suffer it to flow\r\nfreely about their shoulders, sometimes they gather it on the top of the\r\nhead with pieces of vari-coloured stuffs. These savages have a fierce\r\nand martial air, are abrupt in their manners, and rapid in their\r\nmovements. They display extraordinary skill in the management of the\r\nbow, and also make use of the Malayan _kris_ or crease, which they carry\r\nin their girdle. In battle they protect their persons with a\r\nbreast-plate and a buckler of buffalo hide; these two pieces of armour\r\nare ornamented with shells in regular and pleasing designs. The people\r\nof Ombaï are anthropophagic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WARRIORS OF THE ISLAND OF OMBAI.]\r\n\r\nIf now we transport ourselves to the eastern extremity of Polynesia, the\r\nMarquesas Islands, occupied by France in 1842, we shall find there the\r\nPelagian race under one of its handsomest and most amiable types. The\r\nKanaks of this group are not exempt from cannibalism. Nevertheless,\r\nbefore the commerce, civilization, and vices of Europe intruded upon\r\ntheir savage Eden, they lived in a condition of comparative innocence;\r\nand the corruption which has since invaded them preserves that open and\r\nsimple character proper to people in whom the capacity of discerning\r\ngood from evil is but imperfectly developed.\r\n\r\nA traveller, who possesses the threefold merit of being an elegant\r\nwriter, a judicious observer, and an accurate narrator, M. Max Radiguet,\r\nhas embodied in an agreeable volume, entitled \"The Last Savages,\" some\r\nlively impressions of a sojourn of several years in the Marquesas, and\r\nprincipally at Noukahiva. It is from his pages that I borrow the\r\nfollowing sketch of the islanders of this group.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"If you would wish,\" he says, \"to see the Noukahivian in all his purity,\r\nin all his native elegance, it is not among the Teës, it is among the\r\nTaïpis, and in the other less frequented islands of the group, that you\r\nmust seek him.\r\n\r\n\"Of lofty stature, well-spread shoulders, swelling chest, a shapely\r\nfigure, the body lightly set upon the haunches, the Noukahivian advances\r\nwith proud and sometimes arrogant bearing, but always with a confident\r\nmien, a free and hardy manner. He seems fitted for the race and the\r\nescalade rather than for the struggle. He has more the character of the\r\ngymnast than of the athlete. His features are regular and handsome, his\r\nnose straight or aquiline, sometimes short or slightly flattened, never\r\nill-sloped. The mouth is neither large nor thick-lipped; the forehead,\r\nrather low and somewhat receding, is shaved on the upper portion, whence\r\narises the common saying that the Kanaks have a high forehead.\r\n\r\n\"We may easily portray the physical form of an inhabitant of the\r\nMarquesas; but it is more difficult to define the eccentricities of his\r\nfantastic nature. There is much of the child in his disposition; he is\r\nas insensible, or nearly so, to the emotions of gratitude, and has the\r\nsame irascible caprice. He is nervous, restless, impatient. Superstition\r\nis one of his prominent failings. He is hospitable; his first advances\r\nare warm, earnest, playful; then, at the least chill, and from motives\r\nwhich a stranger cannot always appreciate, an abrupt revolution takes\r\nplace, and he becomes wayward and moody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISLANDERS OF NOUKAHIVA.]\r\n\r\n\"The women are of medium stature, their contours frequently modelled\r\nwith a purity which the sculptor has revealed to us almost alone in\r\nFrance.... Few women of fashion are more graceful, if not in their\r\nmovements, at least in their attitudes; and the women of the\r\nneighbouring archipelagoes, the so much eulogized Tahitians,[187]\r\nappear awkward, unwieldy, and sunburnt peasants compared with the\r\nexquisitely elegant daughters of Noukahiva.\r\n\r\n\"The Kanaks talk but little. Frequently they convey their thoughts to\r\none another by a play of the physiognomy which Europeans find it\r\ndifficult to seize. Seated face to face, the back supported against a\r\nstone, the arms crossed beneath the head, they regard each other for\r\nwhole hours without exchanging a single word. In direct contrast to the\r\nnegro, they are very sparing both in words and gestures, when even their\r\ndearest interests are involved. Slow, indolent, averse to labour, not\r\nknowing how to submit themselves to any regular work, they pass the\r\ngreatest part of their time stretched in the shadow of the trees on\r\ntheir mats, sleeping, singing, or weaving garlands. And yet, though they\r\nare sensual, gluttonous, and careless of the morrow, they are gifted\r\nwith a quick wit, a sound judgment, and a very accurate conception of\r\nright and justice.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe do not remark among the numerous tribes scattered over the immense\r\nterritory of the two American continents, and vaguely comprehended under\r\nthe denomination of the Red or American race, differences less profound\r\nor characteristic than among the different fractions of the Negro or\r\nMalayo-Polynesian race. Just as, in speaking of the New World, we\r\nformerly made use of the expression \"the West Indies,\" or the \"Great\r\nIndies,\" we also call by the term \"Indians\" all the aboriginal peoples\r\nof this portion of the globe, and the use of this term, incorrect as it\r\nis, writers as well as readers seem indisposed to surrender. In fact, it\r\npossesses the twofold advantage of being short, and of not attributing\r\nto the peoples which it designates an unity of origin which is doubtful,\r\nor a similitude of colour which does not exist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIANS OF NORTH AMERICA--THE RED SKINS.]\r\n\r\n\"From the North Pole even to Tierra del Fuego,\" says Maury, \"there is\r\nscarcely a shade of human colouring which is not manifested, from the\r\nblack to the yellow. The aborigines, according to their nation, are of a\r\nbrown-olive, a dark brown, bronze, pale yellow, copper yellow, red,\r\nwhite, brown, &c. Their stature does not vary less. Between the\r\nstature, not gigantic but very tall, of the Patagonians and the\r\ndwarf-like proportions of the Changos, we meet with a host of\r\nintermediary 'sizes.' The proportions of the body present the same\r\ndiversity; some peoples have the bust very long, like the tribes of the\r\nPampas; others, short and broad, like the inhabitants of the Peruvian\r\nAndes; the same is the case with the shape and size of the head. Yet we\r\nrecognize between the various American populations an air of kinship,\r\ncertain general features which distinguish them from the races of\r\nthe Old World. Among these features must be placed, in the front\r\nrank, the pyramidal form of the head and the narrowness of the\r\nforehead--characteristics of great antiquity among the American\r\npopulations, since they belong to skulls discovered by Mr. Lund in the\r\ncaves of Brazil associated with the bones of extinct animals.\"\r\n\r\nSpite of this diversity of type, we may divide the Indians of America\r\ninto two races, of which one at least, the Red Skins, is remarkable for\r\nits complete homogeneity. The Red Skins were formerly distributed over\r\nall the upper portion of the American continent--that is, over the\r\nterritory of Canada and the United States, and the northern districts of\r\nMexico. In the sixteenth century they numbered a million and a half of\r\nsouls. They are now reduced to a few thousand families. A few years\r\nmore, and American rifles, brandy, and poverty, will have completed the\r\nextermination of this indomitable race, which has deserved at least the\r\nrespect and the recognition due to honourable courage of those who have\r\ndispossessed them from the immense territories they formerly enjoyed. It\r\nis true, however, that we must not take our estimate of the Red Skins\r\nfrom the romantic pages of Chateaubriand or Fenimore Cooper. We must not\r\ndelude ourselves into a belief that the North American tribes are or\r\nwere composed of Deerskins, Hawkeyes, and Leatherstockings. Yet we\r\ncannot refuse to them a character of real grandeur and true nobility.\r\nTheir contempt of death and suffering, their stoical composure under the\r\nseverest tortures, their disdain of civilization, their horror of\r\nforeign supremacy, their haughtiness, and even their cold and reflective\r\nferocity, are so many traits which place them, in a moral sense, far\r\nabove the majority of the other savage races. A hundred times in\r\nromance, song, and drama have been described the manners of the Red\r\nSkins, their stratagems in war and the chase, the perseverance with\r\nwhich they hunt down their enemy or their prey, their cunning, their\r\nimpassiveness, their vengeance. Who among us has not eagerly followed\r\nthem in their long journeys across the rolling savannahs and through the\r\nprimeval forests? Who has not listened eagerly, when, seated round the\r\nwatch-fire, with the calumet to their lips, they have deliberated\r\ngravely on peace and war? Who has not seen them with alarm dashing to\r\nthe combat on their nimble chargers, brandishing the tomahawk and\r\nscalping their conquered victims, whose scalps they hung up in their\r\nwigwams as trophies to their prowess? Who has not followed them\r\nbreathlessly when on the trail of a flying foe, or winding serpent-like\r\nthrough the thick brush-wood in escape from some persistent pursuer?\r\nAssuredly these men were well worthy of study; and it is impossible to\r\nperuse their history or the narrative of their adventures without a\r\nbreathless interest. There was poetry in their faith, in their customs,\r\nin their language at once laconic and picturesque, and even in the names\r\nwhich they bestowed on each tribe, each chief, each warrior. One can\r\nhardly suppress a feeling of regret that so much wild romance should\r\nhave been swept from the face of the earth, unless we call to mind the\r\nshadows of the picture--the Indian's cruelty, perfidiousness, and savage\r\nlust. Even then our humanity revolts from the treatment to which he has\r\nbeen subjected by the \"white man.\" Tracked and hunted like wild beasts,\r\ndriven back from one hunting-ground to another, embruted by misery or\r\ndrunkenness, incapable of labour, the poor Indians have vainly struggled\r\nagainst the all-devouring influence of a civilization without bowels,\r\nill adapted to attract and persuade them, and far less solicitous to\r\nassimilate than to destroy them. The great nations which were formerly\r\nthe valued allies or dreaded enemies of the European settlers, the\r\nHurons, Algonquins, the Iroquois, the Natchez, the Leni-Lenapes, have\r\nentirely disappeared. The wrecks of other but less important nations\r\nstill exist on the shores of the great northern lakes, in the Far West,\r\nat the base of the Rocky Mountains, in California, in Texas, in\r\nArkansas, and in the northern provinces and deserts of Mexico. Such are\r\nthe Sioux, the Dacotahs, the Flatheads, the Big-Bellies, the Blackfoot,\r\nthe Apaches, the Comanches. The two latter people have, above all,\r\npreserved a certain vitality. Their characteristics, it is said, are\r\nvery diverse. The Comanches are of a mild, gentle nature, and eager to\r\nlive on peaceable terms with the Whites. The Apaches, on the contrary,\r\nhave vowed a relentless hatred against the Pale Faces; they are the\r\nterror of the _hacienderos_[188] and gold-seekers of Upper Mexico, and\r\nthe American journals frequently contain accounts of their incursions,\r\ntheir acts of brigandage, and cruelty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN WOMEN OF NORTH AMERICA.]\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic features of the Red Skin type are, in addition\r\nto the colour of the skin and the pyramidal form of the head, the\r\nprominency and arched outline of the nose, the greatness of the nasal\r\nopenings, corresponding to a singular development of the olfactory\r\nnerve, and the absence of beard. Several tribes subject the head of the\r\nnew-born to a systematic mis-shapement by compressing it. Hence has\r\narisen the nickname of Flat-heads, popularly bestowed on the Choctaws.\r\nThe same custom existed among the Atacapas, the Creeks, the Muskogis,\r\nand the Catawhas, and is found among most tribes of the Californian\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE APACHES ATTACKING AN EMIGRANT TRAIN.]\r\n\r\nThe peoples who have alternately dominated in Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica, and who are now in great part destroyed--the Chichinequas, the\r\nToltequas, and the Aztecs--are allied to the Red Man by their physical\r\npeculiarities as well as by their moral characteristics. The\r\ncomparatively advanced civilization which the Spanish conquerors found\r\nestablished in Mexico had not effaced among the Indians the sanguinary\r\ninstincts and vindictive propensities of their savage ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe race, or rather races which people South America are very far from\r\noffering the same homogeneity as the populations of North America. These\r\nraces are four in number, each of which may be subdivided into several\r\ndistinct branches.\r\n\r\nThe Guarani, or Carib race, formerly occupied the Antilles, and on the\r\nmainland extended as far as Paraguay. It is principally distinguished by\r\nthe yellow colour of its skin, by the rounded contour of its visage, by\r\nthe flatness of the nose, and the oblique disposition of the eyes. It\r\ncomprises three branches: that of the Caribs properly so called, that of\r\nthe Guaranis, and that of the Botocoudos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUARANI INDIANS (SOUTH AMERICA).]\r\n\r\nThe Caribs, whose name has become in our common parlance a synonyme with\r\ncannibal, formed at the epoch of the discovery of the New World the\r\nanthropophagic population of the islands of the Mexican Gulf. To-day,\r\nhowever, it is completely annihilated; but a few scattered offshoots of\r\nthe same race inhabit the banks of the Orinoco. The Caribs are tall and\r\nrobust, and are included among the most ferocious tribes of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe Guaranis, in their physiognomy, the colour of their skin, and their\r\nmanners, approximate closely to the Red Skins. They show the same love\r\nof independence and the same antipathy to the trammels of civilization.\r\nThey are dispersed in the Brazilian forests, and principally in the\r\nprovince of Maranhao or Maragnan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATAGONIANS.]\r\n\r\nThe Botocoudos are the least intelligent scions of the Brazilo-Guarani\r\nbranch. So great is the resemblance between their features and those of\r\nthe Chinese, that Auguste St. Hilaire relates that the Botocoudos,\r\nhaving encountered some natives of \"the Celestial Empire\" in a part of\r\nBrazil, joyously saluted them with all kinds of amicable demonstrations,\r\nand christened them \"their _uncles_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pampas Indians form a mass of tribes dwelling east of the great\r\nCordillera range, from the river Paraguay to the extreme south of the\r\ncontinent. Most of these tribes are nomades; but, thanks to the\r\npersevering efforts of the Roman Catholic missionaries, they have\r\nattained a certain degree of civilization. Their type varies according\r\nto the climate of the country which they inhabit, and according to their\r\nmode of life. In general they have a large head, flat on the top, with\r\nsmall eyes, a big nose, large mouth, and thick lips. They are tall in\r\nstature, and robust-limbed. To this group belong the Patagonians, who\r\nwander, almost constantly on horseback, over the grassy Pampas of the\r\nsouthern extremity of the continent, where they depasture immense herds\r\nof cattle. Former travellers represented the Patagonians as giants\r\nupwards of six and seven feet high, and wonderful accounts of them\r\nfigure in the pages of Drake, Cavendish, and the early navigators. But\r\nthese are violent exaggerations. The Patagonians are certainly tall and\r\nathletic, but their stature does not exceed that of most Europeans, and\r\nassuredly not that of the _corps d'élite_ of the armies of England,\r\nFrance, Prussia, and Austria. Their arms and legs are very long. Their\r\nforehead is exceedingly low; the eyes are sunken; the nose, very thin at\r\nthe root, widens greatly at the base; the lips are very thick; the\r\ncomplexion is of a reddish-brown tint. They suffer their long black\r\nrough hair to grow unchecked, and to fall over the face in \"admired\r\ndisorder.\" Their manners are fierce, brutal, and intractable. The\r\nChiquitos, who inhabit a wooded and well-watered country, lead a more\r\nsedentary and social life; they have embraced Christianity, and dwell on\r\nfriendly terms with the Whites. The Tohas, nomades like the Patagonians,\r\nform a still numerous nation. Their skin is copper-hued, but they have\r\nstraight eyes, an aquiline nose, a free and haughty physiognomy.\r\n\r\nThe Ando-Peruvian race inhabits the forests which clothe the plateau on\r\nthe eastern slope of the Andes. It is characterized by an olive tint, a\r\nmedium height, a receding forehead, and horizontal eyes. The Aymaras and\r\nthe Quichuas are its principal representatives. The latter, according to\r\nOrbigny, do not the least resemble the Caribs or the Pampas Indians, and\r\napproximate much nearer to the Mexicans. Their head is large, oblong\r\nfrom front to back; the forehead low and receding, the face broad, the\r\nnose prominent and aquiline, the mouth large, the chin small, but not\r\nretreating. They had attained, at the time of the Spanish invasion, an\r\nelevated degree of civilization. They support with difficulty the yoke\r\nof the stranger, and the melancholy with which the remembrance of their\r\npast greatness inspires them--the recollection of their vanished\r\nindependence--is reflected in their grave physiognomy and the sombre and\r\nmistrustful expression of their gaze.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fourth South American race may be considered as a more southernly\r\nexpansion of the preceding. Ethnologists designate it the Araucanian.\r\nThe region which it occupies stretches from the 30th parallel of south\r\nlatitude to the vicinity of Tierra del Fuego. The Araucanians properly\r\nso called form three tribes--that of the Ranquels, the Huilliches, and\r\nthe Aucas. They are warriors and nomades. It was in Araucania that a\r\nFrench adventurer, some few years ago, was declared king under the title\r\nof Orélie Antoine I. Overthrown and captured by the Chilian Government,\r\nwith whom he had embroiled himself in hostilities, he succeeded in\r\neffecting his escape and returning to Europe, where his adventures\r\nbecame a \"nine days' wonder.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Araucanian branch belong the Pécherais, an ichthyophagous tribe\r\nof Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nThe natives of these islands, says Admiral Wilkes,[189] are not more\r\nthan five feet high, of a light copper colour, which is much concealed\r\nby smut and dirt, particularly on their faces, which they mark\r\nvertically with charcoal. They have short faces, narrow foreheads, and\r\nhigh cheek-bones. Their eyes are small and usually black, the upper lids\r\nin the inner corner overlapping the under one, and bear a strong\r\nresemblance to those of the Chinese. The nose is broad and flat, with\r\nwide-spread nostrils, mouth large, teeth white, large, and regular. The\r\nhair is long, lank, and black, hanging over the face, and is covered\r\nwith white ashes, which give them a hideous appearance. The whole face\r\nis compressed. Their bodies are remarkable from the great development\r\nof the chest, shoulders, and vertebral column; their arms are long, and\r\nout of proportion; their legs small, and ill-made. There is, in fact,\r\nlittle difference between the size of the ankle and the leg; and, when\r\nstanding, the skin at the knee hangs in a large loose fold. In some\r\nindividuals the muscles of the leg appear almost wanting, and possess\r\nvery little strength. This want of muscular development is owing to\r\ntheir constant sitting posture, both in their huts and canoes. Their\r\nskin is sensibly colder than ours. It is impossible to fancy anything in\r\nhuman nature more filthy. They are an ill-shapen and ugly race.\r\n\r\nThe Pecherais build their huts on the shore of boughs or small trees\r\nplanted in the earth, their tops woven together, and roofed with grass\r\nor bark. Circular in form, they have generally a diameter of seven to\r\neight feet, and measure four or five feet in height, with an oval\r\naperture to serve for an entrance. The fire is built up in a central\r\nexcavation in the clay floor. The sole, or at all events the principal,\r\nfood of this people is shell-fish. They strike the fish, or defend\r\nthemselves, with rudely-fashioned spears and slings. The women generally\r\npaddle the canoes.\r\n\r\nWe also encounter, in the southern provinces of America, in the midst of\r\nthe copper-coloured races of whom I have already spoken, a group of\r\nIndians, almost black, whom Prichard, the illustrious ethnologist, has\r\ndesignated the _Mediterranean_, and whose features recall in a striking\r\nmanner those of some of the Californian tribes. Is this resemblance a\r\nsign of the close relationship existing between two peoples placed, as\r\nit were, at the two extremities of the world? We can hardly admit the\r\nsupposition. It seems more probable that it results from the analogy of\r\nthe climates, and perhaps still more surely from that of the soils,\r\nwhich appear to exercise a mysterious but a powerful influence upon the\r\nmodification of species and races.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n_THE POLAR DESERTS--THE MOUNTAINS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE POLAR DESERTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn countries which enjoy an always elevated temperature, the excess of\r\ntheir fertility is not much more favourable than extreme dryness to the\r\nmaterial and moral development of man. There can be no doubt that the\r\nexuberant vegetation is a potent cause of the insalubrity of the\r\natmosphere. And thus it comes that civilization, commerce, industry,\r\nlabour, have only been able to establish themselves and to make any\r\nconsiderable progress in temperate or even cold countries, where man has\r\nfound a climate more healthy, but at the same time sufficiently unequal,\r\nand often sufficiently inclement, to compel him to defend himself by\r\nvarious means against the rigour of the atmosphere, and a soil capable\r\nof furnishing him abundantly with the products necessary for his wants,\r\nbut on the condition that he gains them by intelligent and persistent\r\ntoil--by the \"sweat of his brow.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we arrive under a latitude or a thermometrical mean which exceeds\r\nby some degrees that of England or France, we find the inhabitants\r\ngiving way to sloth and indolence; their manners are at once softer and\r\nyet fiercer, their passions more violent and their tastes more fertile;\r\narts and poesy occupy them to the neglect of the exact sciences;\r\nindustry and commerce languish, agriculture is despised. But if, on the\r\ncontrary, we proceed towards the north, we discover a greater degree of\r\ncivilization, a warmer devotion to labour. The most industrious peoples\r\nof the world, the English and the Dutch, inherit a cold, humid, and even\r\nfoggy atmosphere. In Canada and the northernmost States of the American\r\nUnion, the Anglo-Saxon race has lost nothing of its laborious habits and\r\nits enterprising audacity. In Sweden and in Norway, in Russia, even in\r\nSiberia, the traveller meets with towns and villages in a flourishing\r\ncondition up to the 60th parallel of north latitude and beyond, under a\r\nclimate whose mean _annual_ temperature is inferior to the mean _winter_\r\ntemperature of France, and where the thermometer frequently descends in\r\nwinter below--40° R. Thus, then, we see that the warm bland tropical air\r\nenervates the mind as well as the body, while the cold of the north\r\nseems to increase their energy. It is also true that cold climates, all\r\nthings considered, are healthier than hot countries, where disease is\r\nmore rapid and fatal in its inroads; and that, finally, civilization\r\nfurnishes man with the means of protecting himself against the injurious\r\neffects of a very low temperature, while it leaves him without defence\r\nagainst those of excessive heat. We shall see hereafter that the human\r\norganism modifies itself, in the Polar regions, in such a manner as to\r\nsupport, without too great suffering, a degree of cold which at the\r\noutset it appears to us must be absolutely intolerable.\r\n\r\nWe may place between the isothermal lines of +5° and of 0° the limit\r\nwhere commences the territory which, in the northern hemisphere, merits\r\nthe name of the Region of the Polar Deserts. Already, in effect, under\r\nthis glacial latitude, the landscape assumes a sombre and desolate\r\naspect, which seems to indicate the propinquity of the \"funereal\r\nglaciers\" of the Pole. The daring traveller who beards the Winter-king\r\nin his own realms meets no more with massive and lofty mountain-crests;\r\na few only of the great chains of Europe and Asia--here the Scandinavian\r\nAlps, there the Oural Mountains; still further, at the easternmost\r\nextremity of Asia, some scattered summits, which we may consider as\r\nbelonging to the elevation of the Altai, prolong even to the Arctic\r\nshores their cantled and snow-shrouded peaks. Everywhere, also, immense\r\nsteppes, intersected by swamps and relieved with woods of fir and birch,\r\nspread for leagues upon leagues in the dull light of a wintry sky, until\r\nthey merge into those rent and rocky plains, bare of all vegetation\r\nexcept a few lichens and mosses, which are almost always encrusted in\r\nglittering snow and ice, and mingle in the distance with the frost-bound\r\nwaters of the Arctic Sea.\r\n\r\nIt is in America that these icy deserts are most extensive; not only\r\nbecause that continent stretches much nearer the Pole than does the Old\r\nWorld, but because, owing to its geographical disposition and geological\r\nstructure, it is much more exposed, even towards the south, to that\r\ncombined action of the atmosphere, land, and water, whose effects\r\nconstitute the Arctic climate.[190]\r\n\r\nThis climate, then, prevails over nearly the whole of Danish America,\r\nthe recently-acquired possessions of the United States, the Hudson's Bay\r\nTerritory, and Labrador, down to that inconsiderable watershed which\r\nseparates from the tributaries of Hudson's Bay, the three basins of the\r\nSt. Lawrence, the five great lakes, and the Mississippi. This line of\r\nwatershed undulates between the 52nd and 49th parallel of latitude, from\r\nBelle-Isle Strait to the sources of the Saskatchewan, in the Rocky\r\nMountains, where it inflects towards the Pacific Ocean, skirting on the\r\nnorth the basin of the Columbia.\r\n\r\n\"Thus circumscribed on the side of the south,\" say Messieurs Hervé and\r\nF. de Lanoye,[191] \"the Arctic lands of America, including the\r\narchipelagoes of the north and north-east, cannot measure less than\r\n560,000 square leagues. They therefore greatly exceed in superficies the\r\nmass of the European lands, estimated at about 490,000 square leagues.\"\r\n\r\nThe same authors divide the Arctic lands into three regions, of which\r\none--they name it \"the Province of the North-West\"--belongs rather to\r\nthose undulating Prairies described in Book III. than to the Polar\r\nDeserts. The two others are the \"Middle or Wooded Region,\" and the\r\n\"Barren Landes.\" The Wooded Region comprehends the basins of the Upper\r\nMackenzie, the Churchill, the Nelson, and the Severn. Hudson's Bay cuts\r\ninto it on the east with its deep anfractuosities. The navigation of\r\nthis Mediterranean of the North, open to the currents and to the drift\r\nof the Polar ices, begins only in the month of June, to close in that of\r\nSeptember; yet in this interval the obstruction of the ices is so great\r\nthat it occupies a stout vessel two months to traverse the diameter of\r\nthe bay. Along the littoral of this sea the soil never thaws below the\r\nsurface, and it often freezes on the very surface in the middle of\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nLike a fierce and despotic tyrant does Winter reign on these shores for\r\nfrom eight to nine months. From the end of September the earth, the\r\nrivers which flow into the bay, their affluents, and the chaplet of\r\nlakes which connect them with one another, all disappear under a layer\r\nof hoar-frost. \"The provinces of New Wales and of Maine do not enjoy for\r\na longer period than three months the temperature of +11° (centigrades),\r\nnecessary for the development of vegetation. The southern shores of the\r\nGreat Bear and Slave Lakes possess that temperature for only two months\r\nat the most.\" It is not until the month of May that the thermometer\r\nrises ever so little above zero in the Wooded Region, and that a breath\r\nof life passes into the plants. Then only the reddish shoots of the\r\nwillows, the poplar trees, and the birches attire themselves in their\r\nlong cottony pods; the thickets grow green; the dandelion, the burdock,\r\nand the saxifrages flourish at the foot of the rocks; then the\r\nsweet-brier, the gooseberry, and the strawberry put forth their fruity\r\nburden; and above these dwarf shrubs the pines, the larches, the thuyas\r\ndisplay all the luxury of their sombre verdure. But at the same time the\r\nmelted snows have transformed the soil, recently so hard and polished\r\nlike marble, into peaty bogs, where myriads of mosquitoes swarm--an\r\nintolerable scourge, which the traveller can only escape by\r\nsurrounding himself with clouds of smoke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DESERT OF ICE (ARCTIC POLE).]\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the region of \"Barren Landes\" is marked by a line\r\ndrawn from the mouth of the Churchill in Hudson's Bay to Mount St. Elias\r\non the Pacific coast, and passing by the southern shores of the Bear and\r\nthe Slave Lakes. To the north of this region it loses itself in the\r\neternal ices, with the last shores of the Parry Archipelago; to the east\r\nand to the north-east, the conformity of the soil and the identity of\r\nthe climate include within it the greatest part of Labrador and all\r\nGreenland, from which it is only separated accidentally by the breaking\r\nup of the ices which constantly solidify Baffin's Bay, and renders so\r\ndifficult, in those districts, the distinction between land and water.\r\n\"In these vast countries,\" say the writers already quoted, \"the\r\nprimitive crust of the globe preserves still the chaotic character which\r\nit assumed at the moment that its fluid elements congealed. Except at\r\nthe bottom of the ravines and hollows, where each winter's thaw has\r\naccumulated long tracts of moss and the wrecks of dwarf willows--the\r\nembryo vegetation of the Polar clime--the slow action of the ages has\r\nnowhere oxidized this rough rude surface to the extent of clothing with\r\na layer of mould its abrupt nakedness. There no transitionary stratum\r\nextends between the primeval granite and the erupted rocks. There,\r\nprolonged chains of trachyte, and gigantic causeways of basalt, display\r\nagain their strata as regular, their ridges as keen, their rents as\r\ndeep, as on the morrow of that day when they emerged from the original\r\nchaos. At a great number of points, as at the bottom of Repulse Bay and\r\nin the interior of Melville Island, whole skeletons of whales elevated\r\nfrom the depths of ocean, with the submarine layer wherein death had\r\nensepulchred them, have not received in all the ages that have passed by\r\nsince their exposure to the day any other shroud than the snows of\r\nsuccessive winters, which, melting before the suns of successive\r\nsummers, annually uncovers their whitened bones, irrefragable proofs of\r\na great geological law.\"\r\n\r\nIn Asia, the isothermal line of 0° descends even towards the 55th\r\nparallel of latitude--that is to say, a little lower than in America;\r\nbut beyond this line we meet again, as I have already said, with towns\r\nof some importance, such as Tobolsk, the capital of Siberia, in lat. 58°\r\n11' north; Irkutsk, in lat. 58° 16' north; and Iakutsk, in lat. 62°. All\r\nthis northern part of Siberia is only distinguished by the greater\r\nrigour of its climate, and by a more and more scanty vegetation from the\r\ngreat Steppes, of which it is the continuation. However, the\r\nnorth-eastern extremity, comprising the peninsula of Kamtschatka,\r\nbristles with volcanic mountains which still exhibit some craters in\r\nactivity, notably those of Avatcha and Klioutchevskoï, or Klutschew. The\r\nlatter belches forth its fires from one of the loftiest summits of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nIn Continental Europe, the only Polar Lands, properly so called, are\r\nRussian Lapland and the deeply-indented coast of Northern Russia. To the\r\nnorth of the most advanced point of that coast, and separated from the\r\ncontinent by a narrow arm of the sea, lie three almost contiguous\r\nislands, which form Nova Zembla (lat. 68° 50' to 76° north); desert\r\nislands, inhabited by a few fishermen, and containing a few vegetables\r\nand animals. The western side of the group is traversed by a\r\nmountain-range 2000 feet in height. Finally, almost in the centre of the\r\nFrozen Sea, and at nearly equal distances from the Old and the New\r\nWorld, rises the gloomy archipelago of Spitzbergen (that is, the Peaked\r\nMountains), first visited by Barentz in 1596, and lying between the\r\nparallels of 77° and 81°, and the meridians of 10° and 24° east of\r\nGreenwich. Their summits, I need hardly tell you, are shrouded in\r\neternal ice and snow, and separated by narrow valleys, or rather\r\nravines, mostly occupied with those slowly-moving ice-rivers called\r\nglaciers. The surrounding seas swarm with fish, and the frozen wastes of\r\nthe islands are haunted by the Arctic fox, the reindeer, and the white\r\nbear. The walrus and the seal live upon their shores, which bristle\r\neverywhere with lofty granitic rocks, and glaciers that plunge down into\r\nthe very waters. Their extremities are constantly throwing off huge\r\nmasses of ice, which float out to sea, and in the shape of icebergs\r\nappal and threaten the mariner. Except during a brief interval of\r\nsummer, the access to Spitzbergen is barred by a formidable barrier of\r\nice, and the channels between the different islands are so blocked up by\r\nthe same material, that it was long doubted whether Spitzbergen was not\r\none large island deeply fissured and intersected by creek and gulf. It\r\nis wholly uninhabited, but the voyager landing at certain points of the\r\ncoast--in Madeleine Bay, for example--treads at every step upon human\r\nbones thickly scattered over the snow, pell-mell with the bones of bears\r\nand seals, and upon the ghastly memorials of empty or half-open coffins.\r\nThese are the remains, the last relics, of unfortunate seamen slain by\r\ncold and hunger in these desolate regions. For want of strength to dig\r\ndecent graves, on account of the thickness of the ice, the survivors\r\nload the coffins with pieces of rock to act as a rampart against the\r\nwild beasts. But \"the great man in a pelisse,\" as the Norwegian hunters\r\ndenominate the white bear, has stout arms, and, impelled by famine, he\r\nfrequently succeeds in displacing the stones, and making a hideous\r\nbanquet off the frozen bodies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe very ocean which washes this gloomy coast shows us the Arctic Desert\r\nunder a form which is at once more imposing, more majestic, and more\r\nterrible. On its surface float vast fields, mountains, and banks of ice,\r\nfar more formidable to the mariner than the typhoons and cyclones of the\r\nTorrid Zone. These floating ice-mountains proceed, as I have said, from\r\nthe terrestrial glaciers which, in these latitudes, descend to the\r\nmargin of the sea, frequently project a considerable distance beyond the\r\ncoast, and, loosened by their own weight or by the incessant clash and\r\ncollision of the waves, splinter into enormous fragments. Hence it is\r\nthat their ice, when liquefied, supplies a fresh, sweet, and wholesome\r\nwater for drinking purposes. Their outlines are of the most fantastic,\r\nand often of the most beautiful character; old ruined keeps of Norman\r\ncastles, long lines of frowning battlements, minarets and domes of\r\nMoorish mosques, and the tapering spires, arched roofs, and flying\r\nbuttresses of mediæval cathedrals. Lit up by the radiance of an Arctic\r\nsun, they wear a most singular and weird beauty, and probably the time\r\nmay come when the artist will gain that inspiration from their sublime\r\nor graceful shapes which he now seeks in the forest, on the sea-shore,\r\nor in the pine-clad mountain-glen.\r\n\r\nMasses of ice rise every year from the bosom, so to speak, of the Polar\r\nSea, and accumulating together, and with the ruins of half-dissolved\r\nicebergs, gradually develop into immense _ice-fields_, which have often\r\nan area of several thousand square yards. Their thickness varies, but is\r\nalways considerably inferior to that of the icebergs. It is not\r\nuncommon, however, for them to attain an elevation of 300 feet, and you\r\ncan form an idea of their gigantic dimensions by recollecting that the\r\nsubmerged portion will be from four to eight times the height of that\r\nwhich rises above the waves. During the winter, mountains and fields of\r\nice congeal together in such wise as to spread over the ocean a compact\r\nand impenetrable crust, an immense desert of snow, broken up by walls\r\nand columns--I should rather say, by monuments--of fantastic design,\r\nwhose radiant glittering surfaces reflect in changing lights of\r\namethyst, azure, vermilion, gold, and emerald, the wondrous fires of the\r\nnorthern auroras. When, after a long absence, the sun returns to dart\r\nobliquely his rays upon the Pole, all this crust splits up and becomes\r\ndislocated; the confusion spreads; the ocean-currents carry off to sea\r\nthe blocks and floes of ice which roll, and glide, and chase, and cross\r\neach other, hurtling together in an indescribable mêlée, and with a\r\nfearful tempest of sounds!\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to speak of the dangers which beset the seaman who\r\ndares to penetrate into the silent recesses of the Polar Seas. And,\r\nindeed, a tale so often told would have little interest for the English\r\nreader, who cannot fail to be familiar with the adventures of the Arctic\r\nexplorers, from Hudson to M'Clure, through the long list of honoured and\r\nimmortal names--Parry, Ross, Franklin, Scoresby, Davis, M'Clintock, and\r\nSir Humphrey Gilbert. Too many, alas! have fallen victims to their\r\nheroic courage, and the most fortunate have not returned in safety\r\nwithout accomplishing prodigies of valour and energy, without\r\nundergoing the severest privations and most terrible sufferings.\r\n\r\nTheir efforts and their sacrifices, let us add, have not been barren.\r\nNot only has the great North-West Passage from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific been finally explored, but the discovery of an open and\r\ncomparatively warm sea around the geographical pole of our globe--the\r\ndiscovery, too, of the magnetic pole, and of the double pole of\r\ncold--ought to be ranked with the most brilliant scientific achievements\r\non which our age can pride itself. Thanks to those heroes of science,\r\nthe Arctic Polar region is now extensively known and very generally\r\nsurveyed. It is not possible to say so much of the Antarctic Polar\r\nregion. There the approach is not facilitated by any continent, or,\r\nindeed, any fraction of a continent. The \"Land of Fire\" (_Tierra del\r\nFuego_), which is the nearest point, is not calculated to brighten the\r\nhopes of the explorer, and the difficulties and perils which oppose\r\nthemselves to his southward progress seem insurmountable. Three\r\nillustrious travellers--sons of England, France, and America\r\nrespectively--Sir James Ross, Dumont D'Urville, and Rear-Admiral Charles\r\nWilkes, attempted, however, in the first half of the present century, to\r\npenetrate the mystery which enshrouds this extremity of our globe.\r\n\r\nAfter sailing for many days amongst prodigious icebergs, which sometimes\r\nthreatened to crush his ships, and sometimes to immure them in a gloomy\r\nprison, Dumont D'Urville considered himself fortunate in sighting, on\r\nthe very line of the Antarctic Circle, a range of black rocky cliffs\r\nwhich he named Clarie Coast and Adelie Land. About the same time\r\nRear-Admiral Wilkes discovered, in 67° 4' south latitude, and 147° 30'\r\neast longitude, a bay which he called the Bay of Disappointment, because\r\nhe found himself there stopped short by impassable ice, and deceived in\r\nhis hope of reaching the Austral Continent. The same navigator, in 65°\r\n59' south latitude, and 105° 18' east longitude, saw, or thought he saw,\r\nan extent of coast which he computed at 65 miles in length, and 3000\r\nfeet in elevation above the sea-level. This coast appeared to him\r\nentirely covered with snow. Disembarking at the point mentioned, he\r\nascertained the presence, under the snow, of clay, red granite, and\r\nbasalt, but no sign of stratification. On the beach, frequented by the\r\nCachalot whale, the seal, and legions of sea-birds, were found numerous\r\nzoophytes and some small crustaceans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADELIE LAND (ANTARCTIC OCEAN).]\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of the American navigator's observations has been, however,\r\ndisputed by geographers, and in 1841 Sir James Ross demonstrated that\r\nthe threshold of this problematical continent was, at least in certain\r\nplaces, much more distant than Wilkes had supposed. Sir James himself\r\ndiscovered, between 70° and 78° south latitude, an extensive tract of\r\nland which he named _South Victoria_, and which extends nearer the\r\nSouth Pole than any other yet known. Its shores are rendered imposing by\r\na line of lofty and snow-crowned mountains, some of which are volcanic.\r\nTo two of the more majestic of these the English voyager gave the names\r\nof his two ships--Mount _Erebus_ and Mount _Terror_. The former is\r\n12,400 feet in height.[192]\r\n\r\nSir James Ross traced the continents of this desolate icy coast for\r\nseven hundred miles, until his progress was arrested by a solid\r\nimpenetrable barrier of lofty ice. He reached, however, on another\r\nmeridian, the latitude of 78° 4' south, the nearest approach yet made to\r\nthe Antarctic Pole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nANIMAL LIFE AND VEGETABLE LIFE IN THE POLAR DESERTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mantle which Flora has spread over the naked body of this earth is,\r\nsays Humboldt, unequally woven. Thickest in those places where the sun\r\nsoars to a great altitude in a cloudless sky, it is of thinner texture\r\ntowards the poles, where Nature seems benumbed and torpid, where the\r\nprecipitate return of frost leaves no time for the buds to unfold, and\r\nsurprises the fruits before they have attained maturity.\r\n\r\nThe number of plants capable of withstanding the prolonged and terrible\r\nArctic winters, and of contenting themselves with the scanty heat and\r\nlight which the pale sun of those regions pours upon them during his\r\nbrief stay above the horizon, is, in effect, very limited. We have seen,\r\nin the preceding chapter, how restricted is the flora of that part of\r\nthe American polar lands which has received the somewhat ambitious\r\nappellation of the \"Wooded Region.\" This flora, so poor and stunted, is\r\nnevertheless the flora of a comparatively fortunate zone. We find it,\r\nwith some variations, to the north of Sweden, Russia, and Siberia.\r\nThere we encounter those ultimate masses of foliage which have any\r\npretensions to the title of Forests--Pines, Firs, Elms, and Birches are\r\nthe only species which compose them. Further north these trees form but\r\nsmall woods, alternating with clumps of poplars and dwarf willows. The\r\nMyrtle of our sub-Alpine forests, and a small winding Honeysuckle, with\r\nrounded leaves, rosy and fragrant flowers, cover in certain places\r\nconsiderable surfaces. Still further north the arborescent species are\r\ncompletely wanting; but vivacious plants, belonging to the families of\r\nRanunculaceæ, Saxifragaceæ, Cruciferæ, and Gramineæ, spread out their\r\nflowers on the surface of the rocks. To the firs and birches, already so\r\nstinted, succeed, in the same localities, a few scattered shrubs; among\r\nothers, the thorny Gooseberry bush, the common Strawberry, the\r\nRaspberry-pseudo-Mulberry (_Rubus Chamæmorus_)--exclusively indigenous\r\nto these regions--and the Oleander of Lapland (_Rhododendron\r\nLaponicum_). Still advancing northward, we meet, on the extreme confines\r\nof the continent, some Dravas (_Cruciferæ_), Potentillas (_Rosaceæ_),\r\nBur-weeds and Rushes (_Cyperaceæ_), and, finally, a few Mosses and\r\nLichens. The commonest mosses are the _Splechnum_, which resemble small\r\numbels; and, in moist localities, the _Sphagnum_, or _Bog-Moss_, whose\r\nsuccessive accumulation, from a very remote epoch, has formed, with the\r\ndetritus of some _Cyperaceæ_, extensive breadths of peat, which might be\r\nutilized as a combustible. The lichens and the mosses are the last\r\nplants which, owing to the simplicity of their organization, are able to\r\ndevelop and reproduce themselves on the Arctic rocks and under the dense\r\nlayer of snow which covers them. Their abundance in almost all the polar\r\nwastes, where every other nutritious plant is wanting, proves an\r\ninestimable benefit for the few inhabitants of those deserts. It will\r\nsuffice to mention, as representatives of the singular family of\r\nCryptogams, the Iceland Moss, which medical science employs in the\r\ntreatment of pulmonary diseases; and the Reindeer Moss, whose foliaceous\r\nexpansions frequently cover vast extents of soil, and form veritable\r\npasture-grounds where the reindeer find almost their only nutriment.\r\n\r\nBut if the Polar Flora offers few details of interest, it is otherwise\r\nwith the Polar Fauna. The most important orders of the Animal Kingdom,\r\nand particularly of the class _Mammalia_, are there represented by\r\nspecies not less worthy of attention than those that people the savage\r\ncountries of the torrid and temperate zones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the _Ruminantia_ we may mention the Eland and the Stag of Canada,\r\nwhich range--the former in the Old and New Continents, the latter in the\r\nNew World only--to a very high latitude; but, to confine myself to the\r\ncharacteristic species of the Hyperborean Fauna, I shall here speak only\r\nof the Musk-Ox and the Reindeer.\r\n\r\nThe Musk-Ox, or Ovibos (_Ovibos Moschatus_), is, as its zoological name\r\nindicates, an intermediate animal between the ox and the sheep. Smaller\r\nthan the former, larger than the latter, he reminds us equally of both\r\nin his form and appearance. He has an obtuse nose; horns broad at the\r\nbase, covering the forehead and crown of the head, and curving downwards\r\nbetween the eye and ear until about the level of the mouth, where they\r\nturn upwards; the tail is short, and almost lost in the thickness of the\r\nhair, which is generally of a dark brown, and of two kinds, as with all\r\nthe animals of Polar regions,--a long hair, which on some parts of the\r\nbody is thick and curled, and, beneath it, a fine kind of soft,\r\nash-coloured wool; the legs are short and thick, and furnished with\r\nnarrow hoofs, resembling those of the moose. The female is smaller than\r\nthe male, and has also smaller horns. Her general colour is black,\r\nexcept that the legs are whitish; and along the back runs an elevated\r\nridge or mane of dusky hair.\r\n\r\nThe musk-ox, as might be inferred from his name, exhales a strong odour\r\nof musk, with which his very flesh is impregnated, and which\r\ncommunicates itself to the knife employed in cutting him up. Not the\r\nless is he esteemed a precious prey by the Indians and Eskimos, who hunt\r\nhim actively. He wanders in small herds over the rocky prairies which\r\nstretch to the north of the great lakes of North America. He is an\r\nirascible animal, and will fight desperately in defence of the female.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Reindeer (_Cervus Turandus_) is about the size of our English stag,\r\nbut of a squatter and less graceful form. He stands about four feet six\r\ninches high. His head is crowned with remarkably long and slender horns;\r\nand they have branched, recurved, and round antlers, whose summits are\r\npalmated. His colour is brown above and white beneath; but as the animal\r\nadvances in age, it changes into a grayish-white, and is sometimes\r\nalmost wholly white. The nether part of the neck droops like a kind of\r\nhanging beard. His hoofs are large, long, and black; and so are the\r\nsecondary hoofs behind. The latter, while the reindeer is running, make\r\nby their collision a curious clattering sound, which may be heard at a\r\nconsiderable distance.\r\n\r\nThis species formerly spread over Europe and Asia to a tolerably low\r\nlatitude.Cæsar particularizes it among the animals of the Hercynian\r\nForest. Even at the present day troops of wild reindeer traverse the\r\nwooded summits of the prolongation of the Ural Mountains. They advance\r\nbetween the Don and the Volga to the 46th parallel of latitude; and they\r\nextend their wanderings even to the foot of the Caucasus, on the banks\r\nof the Kouma. But their true habitat is that belt of ice and snow\r\nbounded by the Arctic polar circle, or, more properly, by the isothermal\r\nline of 0° centigrade. \"Both the wild and the tame reindeer,\" says\r\nDesmoulins, \" change their feeding-grounds with the seasons. In winter\r\nthey descend into the plains and valleys; in summer they take refuge\r\nupon the mountains, where the wild herds gain the loftiest terraces, the\r\nmore easily to escape the attacks of gadflies and other insect enemies.\r\nIt is very remarkable that each species of animal has, so to speak, his\r\ninsect parasite. The oestre so terrifies the reindeer that the mere\r\nappearance of one in the air will infuriate a herd of a thousand\r\nanimals. As it is then the moulting season, these insects deposit their\r\neggs in the skin, where the larvæ lodge and multiply _ad infinitum_,\r\nincessantly renewing centres of suppuration.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REINDEER OF LAPLAND.]\r\n\r\nTo the natives of North America, says a zoologist, the reindeer is only\r\nknown as a beast of chase, but he is a most important one. There is\r\nhardly a part of the animal which is not made available to some useful\r\npurpose. Clothing made of the skin is, according to Sir J. Richardson,\r\nso impervious to the cold, that, with the addition of a blanket of the\r\nsame material, any one so clothed may bivouac on the snow with safety in\r\nthe most intense cold of an Arctic winter's night. The venison, when in\r\nhigh condition, has several inches of fat on the haunches, and said to\r\nequal that of the fallow-deer in our best English parks: the tongue and\r\nsome of the tripe are reckoned most delicious morsels. Pemmican is\r\nformed by pouring one-third part of melted fat over the pounded meat,\r\nand incorporating them well together. The Eskimos and Greenlanders\r\nconsider the stomach or paunch, with its contents, a great delicacy; and\r\nCaptain Sir James Ross says that these contents form the only vegetable\r\nfood which the natives of Boothia ever taste.[193]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe order of _Rodents_ has no other representatives in the Arctic\r\nDeserts than the Arctic Hare and the Alpine Lagomys. The former is a\r\nlittle larger than our European hare. His abundant fur, gray in summer,\r\ngrows white in winter, and affords him protection, by a merciful\r\nprovision of nature, against the carnivorous beasts of prey. It becomes\r\nimpossible to discern him from the snowy mantle which covers all the\r\nearth. He is a native of Labrador and Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe Lagomys are small animals, scarcely exceeding the Guinea-pig in\r\nsize, and measuring only nine inches in length. His long head is\r\nornamented with a pair of short, broad, and rounded ears. He inhabits\r\nthe Altaï Mountains, but extends even into Kamtschatka, seeking an\r\nasylum in the wooded tracts among the mossy rocks and flashing\r\nwaterfalls, lodging in the fissures or burrowing in the most\r\nsequestered corners. During the autumn he lays up a store of winter\r\nprovision by collecting the finest grass and moss and herbs. These he\r\ndries in the sun, and disposes in small heaps or hayricks, which vary in\r\nsize according to the number of animals employed, and frequently furnish\r\nthe sable-hunter with provender for his horse in the hour of direst\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe group of Arctic Carnivora, more numerous than the reader would at\r\nthe first glance suppose, includes those animals which furnish commerce\r\nwith the costliest furs.\r\n\r\nExcept the Fox and the White Bear, of which I shall presently speak, all\r\nthese Carnivora belong to the family which has for its type the\r\n\"long-spined animal\"--the common European Weasel (_Mustela_)--and which\r\nborrows from it its zoological appellation of _Mustelidæ_.\r\n\r\nIn this family the most remarkable genera are undoubtedly the Martens,\r\nthe Polecats, the Gluttons, and the Otters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Martens of the North are cousins-german of the weasels, so justly\r\nfeared by our farmers and villagers on account of the extensive\r\ndepredations which they commit in the poultry-yard. The martens are not\r\nless ferocious; but in the fir and birch forests which they inhabit, it\r\nis upon the small rodents, the birds, and, when necessity prompts, upon\r\nthe reptiles, that they exercise their sanguinary tyranny. They scale\r\ntrees as nimbly as cats; and their flexible body enables them to\r\nintroduce themselves into the smallest openings, where a cat could not\r\npass, and into the burrows and fissures of the trees or rocks which\r\nserve as an asylum for their victims. They are, moreover, very pretty\r\nanimals, with lively manners, a cunning physiognomy, and a rich furry\r\nattire. Besides the ordinary marten, which is found in all the north of\r\nEurope, zoologists distinguish in this genus several species exclusively\r\nindigenous to the coldest regions of the two continents. The most\r\nrenowned for the beauty of his coat is the Zibelline, or Sable, which we\r\nmust look for in Northern Russia and Siberia. Its hairs, whose general\r\nshade is a grayish-brown, possess this singular property, which\r\ndistinguishes them from every other kind of fur--they have no particular\r\ninclination, and consequently may be laid down indifferently in any\r\ndirection whatever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERMINE AND SABLE-MARTEN.]\r\n\r\nThe genus Polecat (_Mustela putarius_) comprehends the smallest of all\r\nknown Carnivora--the Weasel, the Ferret, and the Ermine. The temperate\r\ncountries of Europe possess one variety of the latter species; but the\r\nermines of the extreme north have a much fuller and softer fur. These\r\nanimals, like many others, change their garb according to the season.\r\nThe ermine, which poets have adopted as the emblem of purity, on account\r\nof his spotless whiteness, in reality only merits that dangerous honour\r\nin the winter; it is then only that he assumes that immaculate robe\r\nwhich the proudest monarchs are content to wear. In summer its colour is\r\na clear maroon. His tail alone remains at all times of a beautiful\r\nshining black.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Glutton (_Gulo Arcticus_) is a carnivorous quadruped of a very\r\nvoracious nature, about the size of a large badger, between which and\r\nthe polecat he appears to form a link. His legs are short and robust; he\r\nhas a compact body, large head, and unwieldy gait. His ears are small;\r\nhis tail is short and tufted. His skin is a black brown on the top of\r\nthe head and back; a white line extends along each flank, from the\r\nshoulder to the root of the tail. The muzzle is black; the remainder of\r\nthe body a deep brown. Like most of the mammals of the Polar region, he\r\nhas two kinds of hair--the upper long and coarse, the lower soft, fine,\r\nand of an uniform brown colour. The glutton owes his name to his extreme\r\nvoracity. He does not fear to attack animals of the size of the\r\nreindeer; he leaps upon them, fastens his claws in them, rends them to\r\npieces, until at length they fall exhausted. After having gorged himself\r\non their flesh and blood, he hides the remainder for another repast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe genus Otter (_Lutra vulgaris_) comprehends several species,\r\ndistributed over nearly all the countries of the world. I shall here\r\nspeak only of the Otter of Kamtschatka, or Sea Otter (_Enhydra lutris_),\r\nso named on account of his essentially aquatic habits. He weighs from\r\nseventy to eighty pounds. In full season his colour is perfectly black;\r\nat other times, of a dark brown. He attains the length of three feet,\r\nincluding his tail; has hind-feet resembling those of a seal; the upper\r\njaw is armed with six, and the lower with four incisors. The grinders\r\nare broad, and well adapted for crunching crustaceous animals. He runs\r\nwith great rapidity, and swims with astonishing ease and swiftness. Of\r\nlate years, however, he has been the object of so murderous a chase on\r\nthe part of the Russian and American hunters that he has almost\r\ndisappeared from the Polar shores. The skins of the sea otter are much\r\nprized by the Chinese, who pay for them from seventy to one hundred\r\nroubles a-piece. Very few ever reach the European market.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong those Carnivora which are able to accommodate themselves to the\r\nseverest climates, I may mention the Foxes. These animals attire\r\nthemselves, under the Polar latitudes, in a fur of sufficient thickness\r\nto endure the intense cold they are required to support; and this fur is\r\nesteemed among the most precious varieties, under the names of Isatis\r\nskin, White Fox, Black, Blue, and Tricoloured Foxskins. The shades vary\r\naccording to Reynard's habitat, his age, and also the season; they\r\ncorrespond in like manner to the differences of race, but not to the\r\ndifferences of species. The most valuable skins are obtained from those\r\nfoxes which belong to very cold countries; and it seems that as they\r\nrecede from a certain latitude, they lose their value. \"Some Blue Foxes\r\nwere killed by our hunters,\" says Madame Léonie d'Aunet, \"which were\r\nstunted and ugly. The Spitzbergen foxes do not in any respect resemble\r\nthe foxes of Iceland or Siberia, whose fur is so beautiful and in such\r\nhigh repute. That they may be thoroughly protected from the cold, they\r\ndo not wear upon their bodies a fur so much as several thick folds or\r\nlayers of very thick hair, so intermingled and threaded that it is\r\nrather a mattress than a coat of fur. Moreover, instead of being of a\r\nsomewhat tawny colour, like the Iceland foxes, they are of an\r\nashen-gray. Their skin, nevertheless, is excellently adapted for making\r\ncarpets.\"\r\n\r\nI see no intermediaries between the small Carnivora we have just passed\r\nin review, and the formidable tyrant of the icy Deserts, the Polar or\r\nMarine Bear (_Ursus marinus_), popularly known as the White Bear; an\r\nimproper appellation, as it confounds the Bear of the Arctic Seas with\r\nthe Albino variety of the Common Bear.\r\n\r\nThe former constitutes a perfectly distinct species, whose\r\ncharacteristics, apart from the yellowish-white colour of his rich soft\r\nfur, are a flattened and elongated head, a long neck, high legs, and\r\nfeet whose conformation is admirably adapted to the habitat and\r\namphibious existence of the animal. In fact, the sole of each foot is\r\ngarnished with a thick fleece, which permits the Arctic bear to walk on\r\nthe ice as on a carpet, and the toes are connected by a membrane which\r\nrenders them eminently fit for natatory purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic bear seldom visits the land; his favourite sojourn is the\r\nfloating ice-field, and his diet the corpses of whales and seals, or\r\neven living _Phocæ_, which he fearlessly attacks at the impulse of\r\nhunger. \"On seeing his intended prey,\" says Captain Lyon, \"he gets\r\nquietly into the water, and swims until to leeward of him, from whence,\r\nby frequent short dives, he silently makes his approaches, and so\r\narranges his distances that at the last dive he comes to the spot where\r\nthe seal is lying. If the poor animal attempts to escape by rolling into\r\nthe water, he falls into the bear's clutches; if, on the contrary, he\r\nlies still, his destroyer makes a powerful spring, kills him on the ice,\r\nand devours him at leisure.\"\r\n\r\nIn cases of urgency the bear does not scruple to make a prey of man, and\r\nhe is assuredly a formidable antagonist. His dimensions are enormous; he\r\nis endowed with prodigious strength. Some individuals have been met with\r\nwho measured nine to ten feet in length. Their average size is about six\r\nfeet in length, and about three in height, to the top of the shoulder.\r\nSpite of their ferocity, which with them, as with nearly all the\r\nCarnivora, is a natural consequence of their appetite, the white bears\r\nare sociable in their habits: they frequently wander about in small\r\ntroops, and those of a family invariably \"flock together.\" The male, the\r\nmother, and their young are united by the ties of an affection which is\r\ncapable of the most intrepid devotion. The female especially watches\r\nover her cubs with the most anxious solicitude, and defends them to the\r\nlast extremity. Of this philoprogenitiveness a voyager relates what\r\nseems to me a truly pathetic example:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WHITE BEAR AND HER CUBS.]\r\n\r\nA vessel belonging to a small squadron commanded by Captain Philippe was\r\ncaught in the Polar ice. One morning, the look-out man signalled the\r\napproach of three bears, which were advancing rapidly towards the\r\nvessel, attracted by the odour of some seal's flesh roasted on the\r\nprevious evening. The three consisted of a she bear and her two cubs.\r\nThe seamen at a suitable moment fired at the latter, and killed them.\r\nThe mother was also wounded, but not mortally. It was a spectacle which\r\ndrew tears from the least susceptible to see the marks of sorrow and\r\ntenderness lavished by this poor beast upon her young. She carried to\r\nthem a piece of the flesh which she had taken possession of, and divided\r\nit into two portions, which she placed before them. Seeing that they did\r\nnot eat, she touched them alternately with her fore-paws, and\r\nendeavoured to raise them, uttering at the same time the most lamentable\r\ngroans. Then she withdrew, halted a few paces, and summoned her little\r\nones by a low sad cry. As they remained insensible to her appeal, she\r\nreturned to them, moved them anew, smelt them on every side, dragged\r\nthem some distance, again returned, still moaning and bewailing, licked\r\ntheir wounds, called them; and finally, when assured that they had\r\nceased to live, and understanding what had transpired, she stood half\r\nerect by a great effort, turned towards the ship, and gave vent to a\r\nroar of agony and rage, an unmistakable imprecation against her\r\nmurderers. The latter replied with a discharge of musketry. The poor\r\nbear fell smitten between her two little ones, and died licking their\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong other Mammiferous animals belonging to the Polar regions, my space\r\nonly permits me a brief allusion to the Seal and the Walrus. The Seal\r\n(_Phoca vitulina_) seems to the eye a compound of the fish and the\r\nquadruped; having the tail of the former, the head, spine, and body of\r\nthe latter. Its physiognomy is remarkable for its peculiarly mild and\r\nintelligent expression. Its elongated, conical body tapers from the\r\nshoulders to the tail. Its feet are of singular construction. They are\r\ncovered with a membrane, and so united to the body that they might be\r\nmistaken for fins, but for the sharp strong claws that terminate them.\r\n\r\nSeals swim with great rapidity, and can remain under water for a\r\nconsiderable period. The species are very numerous. The Greenland or\r\nHarp Seal (_Phoca Greenlandica_) measures about six feet in length. The\r\nBearded Seal (_P. barbata_) is from seven to ten feet long. The largest\r\nknown species is the Elephant Seal or Sea-Elephant (_Macrorhinus\r\nproboscideus_), whose girth at the largest part of the body is from\r\nfifteen to eighteen feet, and its length from twenty-five to thirty\r\nfeet. It is a native of the Antarctic Seas. The Sea-Lion (_Platyrhynchus\r\nleoninus_), so called from its long full mane, inhabits both the\r\nnorthern and southern coasts of the Pacific. The Sea-Bear\r\n(_Arctocephalus ursinus_) derives its name from the fur and shape of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe Walrus or Morse (_Trichecus_) is a genus of the Phocidæ, or Seal\r\nfamily, distinguished by its widely different cranium and teeth. In the\r\nadult lower jaw are neither incisors nor canines, while the upper\r\nbristles with two enormous tusks, which are directed downwards, and are\r\nsometimes two feet long. It chiefly feeds upon molluscs and marine\r\nvegetables, and its flesh in its turn affords a dainty repast to the\r\ninhabitants of the Polar Deserts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     THE INHABITANTS OF THE ARCTIC WILDERNESSES:--THE\r\n     LAPLANDERS--SAMOIEDES--OSTIAKS--KAMTSCHATDALES--ESKIMOS, OR\r\n     ESQUIMAUX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the various populations which occupy the Arctic regions of both the\r\nOld and the New World, the general appellation of Hyperboreans is\r\nsometimes given. Do these populations truly form, as some ethnologists\r\nassert, a distinct and homogeneous race; or are they not rather\r\nindependent offshoots of the Japhetic race in Europe, of the Mongolian\r\nin Asia, of the Redskins in America? To this question I can give no\r\nsatisfactory reply. I will only say that if the different fractions of\r\nthis great group exhibit among themselves external differences of a very\r\nmarked character, they are drawn together, on the other hand, by no less\r\nstriking resemblances. In truth, these resemblances are markedly\r\nphysiological, and should, I think, be exclusively attributed to the\r\npowerful and irresistible action of external agencies. If there be,\r\nindeed, one region where the influence of climate on the constitution of\r\nman is manifest, that region is assuredly the Polar Zone. There the\r\nconditions of life differ wholly from those which prevail in all other\r\nparts of the globe, and it necessarily results that modifications take\r\nplace in the organism of the men subject to those conditions, which\r\nought to be regarded as wholly independent of the origin of races and of\r\ntheir ethnographic characters properly so called.\r\n\r\nThe Hyperboreans are small, squat, ugly, and deformed. Their legs are\r\nshort and sufficiently straight, but so thick, says Bory de St. Vincent,\r\nthat to the spectator they seem swollen and diseased. Their head is\r\ngenerally of large size. They have long, coarse, straight hair, a thin\r\nbeard, a broad countenance, a great mouth, high cheek-bones, and\r\nhalf-closed eyes, of a light colour, as gray or yellowish, but never\r\nblue. Their complexion is sometimes of a yellowish-white, as with the\r\nLaplanders; sometimes of a deep yellow or reddish-brown, as with the\r\nEskimos and the Greenlanders. The latter peculiarity may be invoked as a\r\nvery plausible argument in support of the opinion which gives to the\r\nArctic peoples different origins. It shows also, once more, that the\r\nmore or less intense colouring of the skin among the African races is\r\nnot an effect of the solar heat, as was commonly supposed.\r\n\r\nConsidered from a physiological point of view, the Hyperboreans are\r\ndistinguished by a remarkable uniformity of characteristics, which\r\ndeserve to be specified. The sanguine temperament predominates among\r\nthem. Their nervous system is but slightly developed, their sensibility\r\nblunted, their intelligence slow, their imagination feeble. Their\r\nexternal perspiration is almost null, and they are accustomed to\r\nsuppress it entirely by induing their bodies in oily substances. On the\r\nother hand, their organs of nutrition and respiration are endowed with\r\nan extraordinary activity; and in this lies the secret of the extreme\r\nfacility with which they support for several successive months the most\r\nrigorous cold. We know, indeed, that man and the warm-blooded animals\r\npossess, in their respiratory apparatus, a positive internal furnace,\r\nwhere a notable part of the carbon and the hydrogen contained in their\r\nvenous blood is consumed in contact with the air. But to maintain this\r\nfurnace at such a degree of heat as shall always preserve the\r\ntemperature of the body at its normal standard (39° C.), the inhabitants\r\nof Arctic climes need constantly feed it with fuel, that is, with\r\nsubstances rich in carbon and hydrogen. Hence the keen appetite of the\r\nHyperboreans for oil, fat, and flesh; hence, too, their voracity. The\r\ninhabitants of torrid or temperate regions, while sojourning among the\r\nicy wastes of the Pole, quickly become sensible of the same necessity,\r\nand eagerly feed upon aliments which elsewhere would inspire them with\r\ninsurmountable disgust.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that most of the diseases so frequent and so\r\nmurderous in civilized countries are unknown in the Polar lands. But, on\r\nthe other hand, ophthalmia is endemic, and the cutaneous affections, as\r\nwell as cerebral and pulmonary congestion, are of common occurrence. To\r\nsum up: the already scattered and scanty population of the Arctic Zone\r\nis daily decreasing, and will probably be extinct in a few generations.\r\n\r\nThe manners of all the Hyperboreans present the same general features:\r\nthey are peaceable, inoffensive, and reduced, if I may use the\r\nexpression, to the utmost possible minimum of physical and intellectual\r\nactivity. This race, or group of races, is represented on the two\r\ncontinents by several distinct peoples. Those most clearly defined\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n    In Europe, the Laplanders (or Lapps), and the Samoiedes;\r\n    In Asia, the Ostiaks, Yakouts, and Kamtschatdales; and,\r\n    In North America, the Eskimos (or Esquimaux).\r\n\r\nThe Laplanders inhabit the northernmost coasts of the Scandinavian\r\npeninsula. They are ignorant, uncultivated, and _torpid_, rather than\r\nsavage. In spite of their frequent contact with the Russians and the\r\nSwedes, they have no industrial resources, no art, no other commerce\r\nthan that which is afforded by the products of the chase, of their\r\nfisheries, or their herds of reindeer. Christianity, to which they were\r\nconverted about two centuries ago, has not aroused them as yet from\r\ntheir moral and intellectual lethargy. All religion being reduced, so\r\nfar as they are concerned, to oral tradition, the devotion of each is in\r\nproportion to his memory. Education among them has attained to this\r\nstandard, that a Laplander who knows his alphabet corresponds to a young\r\nman among us who has graduated at Oxford or Cambridge.\r\n\r\nA French traveller, M. de Saint-Blaize, furnishes some details\r\nrespecting this people:--\r\n\r\n\"The race of Laplanders is constantly diminishing in numbers. It is of\r\nAsiatic origin, as may be clearly discerned in their language and the\r\ntype of their physiognomy. Some are fishers, and dwell upon the coast;\r\nothers are shepherds, who traverse the mountains in every direction,\r\npasturing their reindeer on the white moss. During the three months'\r\nsummer the Laplander leads his herd into the elevated regions, to\r\nwithdraw them from the excessive heats and the mosquito-plagues: in\r\nwinter, he brings them near the dwellings of men, principally for the\r\nsake of protecting them more effectually from his bitter enemies, the\r\nwolves, of whom he never speaks but with a sentiment of profound hatred.\r\nThe Laplander's wealth is his herd, which feeds him, clothes him, and\r\nprocures him, by way of barter, brandy and tobacco, the only objects of\r\nhis desire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAPLAND FISHERS.]\r\n\r\n\"The independent life of this nomadic people is not without its charm.\r\nAccustomed from his infancy to privations and fatigues of every kind,\r\nthe Laplander suffers little. His body acquires an extraordinary vigour,\r\nand most of our maladies are unknown to him. If during a journey a\r\nLapland woman gives birth to a child, she places the new-born in a piece\r\nof hollow wood, where a hole has been cut out to receive the little\r\none's head; then slings this cradle on her back, and resumes her\r\njourney. When she halts, she suspends her wooden chrysalid to a tree,\r\nand the wire-work protects it from the teeth of ferocious beasts. The\r\nreverse of this simple medal is an old age almost inevitably very\r\nunhappy. It is said that when a Laplander has no longer the strength to\r\nrender himself useful, his children abandon him by the roadside, with\r\njust provisions enough to support him for a few days. The traveller\r\nfrequently encounters in the forest the skeletons of old men who have\r\nthus perished in gloomy solitude.\"\r\n\r\nThe cradle to which our authority refers is described by Professor\r\nForbes as cut out of solid wood and covered with leather, in flaps so\r\narranged as to lace across the top with leathern thongs; the inside and\r\nthe little pillow are rendered tolerably soft with reindeer moss, and\r\nthe infant fits the space so exactly, that it can neither stir hand nor\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe Lapp hut, says Professor Forbes,[194] is formed interiorly of wood,\r\nby means of curved ribs uniting near the centre in a ring, which is\r\nopen, and allows free escape for the smoke; the fire being lighted in\r\nthe centre of the floor. The exterior is covered with turf. The door is\r\nof wood on one side. The inmates recline on skins on the floor, with\r\ntheir feet towards the fire; and behind them, on a row of stones near\r\nthe wall of the hut, are their various utensils. Their clothing--chiefly\r\nof tanned skins and woollen stuffs--looked very dirty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SAMOIEDE FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nThe Samoiedes (or Samoyedes) are scattered, to the number of about a\r\nthousand families, along the coasts of the Frozen Sea, in the government\r\nof Archangel, and, in Siberia, in the governments of Tobolsk and Tomsk.\r\nEthnologists generally consider them to have a common origin with the\r\nFinns of Europe. In stature they are somewhat taller than the Lapps,\r\nand their colour is more of a tawny. The marked features of their\r\ncountenance recall the Hindu type. The forehead is high, the hair black,\r\nthe nose long, the mouth well-formed; but the sunken eye, veiled by a\r\nheavy lid, expresses a cruel and perfidious nature. The manners of the\r\nSamoiedes are brutal. In character they are wily, fierce, and cunning.\r\nThey are shepherds, hunters, traders, and, when opportunity serves,\r\nrobbers. They clothe themselves in reindeer-skins, like the other\r\nHyperboreans of the old continent. They shave off their hair, except a\r\ntolerably large tuft which they allow to flourish on the top of the\r\nhead, and they pluck out the beard as fast as it grows. The women adorn\r\nthemselves with a belt of gilded copper, and with a profusion of\r\nornaments in glass beads and metal. They are heathens, worshipping the\r\nsun and moon, the water and the trees; in fact, whatever object meets\r\ntheir eyes they convert into a deity; and, above all, they adore the\r\nbear, offering prayers and sacrifices to him before venturing on an\r\nexpedition to hunt him down!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Ostiaks and the Yakouts are established in the northernmost\r\ndistricts of Siberia, from the Oural Mountains to Kamtschatka. I borrow\r\nfrom a Polish lady, Madame Felinska, long exiled in Siberia, some\r\ncurious details relative to the Ostiaks, whom, during her banishment,\r\nshe had numerous opportunities of studying. Seeking one day a pathway\r\nthrough a wood, she encountered a couple of Ostiaks on the point of\r\nperforming their religious duties. These consist in placing themselves\r\nbefore a tree--a larch in preference--in the wildest and densest part of\r\nthe forest, and there executing a series of epileptic contortions. Such\r\npagan demonstrations are forbidden them, says Madame Felinska; but,\r\ndespite the Christianity which they have professed to accept, they are\r\nand will remain pagans.\r\n\r\nNearly every Ostiak carries about his person a rude image of the\r\ndivinities which he adores under the name of _Schaïtan_; but this does\r\nnot prevent him from wearing on his breast a small copper crucifix. The\r\nSchaïtan represents the human figure, carved in wood, or, rather, cut\r\nout of a small fragment of wood. It is of different sizes, according to\r\nthe price and the various uses for which it is intended: if for carrying\r\non the person, it is small; images for decorating the hut are much\r\nlarger; but in every case the god is clothed in seven pearl-embroidered\r\nchemises, and suspended to the neck by a chaplet of silver coins. The\r\nwooden deity occupies the place of honour in the huts and cottages, and\r\nbefore commencing a repast, they take care to offer him the daintiest\r\nmorsel, smearing his lips with fish or raw game; when this sacred duty\r\nis performed, they eat in contentment.\r\n\r\nThe priests of the Ostiaks are called _Scha-mans_; they enjoy immense\r\ninfluence, which they employ in furtherance of the basest superstition\r\nand in promotion of their own personal interest. Ambition and egotism\r\ndispense with knowledge and science in order to corrupt mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YAKOUT HUNTER WORRIED BY A WHITE BEAR.]\r\n\r\nThe Ostiaks and the Samoiedes are great hunters of the white bear. It is\r\nthe same with the Yakouts, a people dwelling near the Bouriats, and\r\napproaching, like them, to the Mongol type. It seems that the object of\r\nthe chase is not always to kill the animal, but to catch him alive.\r\nMadame Felinska relates that she saw one day a considerable troop of\r\nbears conducted to Bérézov like a herd of tame cattle, and apparently\r\nquite as inoffensive. She neglects to inform us, however, by what means\r\nthey had been reduced to this state of passive obedience. The Ostiaks\r\nand the Yakouts frequently attack the white bears body to body, without\r\nany other weapon than a hatchet or a long cutlass. They need to strike\r\nthe animal with extreme skill and vigour, to slay him at the first blow,\r\nor otherwise they incur extreme peril. If he misses his stroke, the\r\nhunter's only resource is to fling himself on the ground and lie\r\nmotionless, until the bear, while smelling his body and turning him\r\nover, incautiously offers himself again to his attack.\r\n\r\nThe Yakouts are nearly of average height. They are robust and brave,\r\nhonest and hospitable, but addicted to idolatry and polygamy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAMTSCHATDALES.]\r\n\r\nThe Kamtschatdales are smaller and shorter than the Yakouts. They have a\r\nround flat face, a broad depressed nose, and prominent cheek-bones. They\r\nare of a friendly, mild, and peaceable character. They have a strong\r\npartiality for the song and the dance, and their amusements frequently\r\ndegenerate into orgies. Small-pox and excessive brandy-drinking have\r\nreduced to a few hundred families a population which numbered, a century\r\nago, fully 15,000 souls.\r\n\r\nOne sole population inhabits the immense icy plains which extend into\r\nAmerica even beyond the Polar circle. I refer to the Eskimos, who are\r\nfound--encamped in summer under tents made of reindeer or seal-skin,\r\nhidden in winter in their snow-huts--from Behring's Strait even to Cape\r\nFarewell. This race has the reddish-brown tint of the North American\r\nIndians. In its small stature and physical forms it does not differ from\r\nother Hyperboreans; but in physiognomy and the flattened skull it\r\nsingularly recalls the men of lofty stature who inhabit the other\r\nextremity of the American continent, the Patagonians. The physiognomy,\r\nthe character, and the manners of the Eskimos have been frequently\r\ndescribed. The courageous navigators who have explored the Polar Sea in\r\nquest of a North-west Passage have held frequent intercourse with these\r\npoor people, and all agree in eulogizing their gentleness, their\r\npatriarchal life, their eagerness to succour strangers. An American,\r\nCaptain Hall, the last adventurer who has set himself the task of\r\ndiscovering the wrecks of Franklin's ill-fated expedition, spent a whole\r\nyear in the midst of the Eskimos, whose amiability and generosity he\r\npraises in no stinted terms. Exclusively hunters and fishers, the\r\nEskimos have no other domestic animal than the dog; they harness it to\r\ntheir sledges, and also train it to chase the seal, the walrus, and the\r\nreindeer. It is in the summer only that they hunt the latter animal. In\r\nthat genial season there is no lack of other game, terrestrial and\r\nmarine. It is for them a season of abundance, wherein they gorge\r\nthemselves with flesh, blood, and fat. During the winter they often fast\r\nseveral days at a time, and remain immured in their huts like\r\nhybernating animals; but at length, driven by famine and by want of oil,\r\nthey go forth upon the ice in search of the seals which come up to\r\nbreathe. When they have been fortunate enough to kill one, they divide\r\nit amongst them amicably, and regale themselves upon it until only the\r\nbones remain, after which they endure a new period of privation. Thus\r\nthey live from day to day, in continual alternations of gluttony and\r\nabstinence, without injury to their health, and without shortening their\r\nlives. And it is worthy of notice that Europeans who once consent to\r\nadopt this regime--to drink the warm blood and eat the raw flesh and fat\r\nof seals--soon accept of it without the slightest repugnance, and become\r\ncapable of enduring, like true Hyperboreans, the terrible cold of the\r\nlong Polar winters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Sagalien, one of the northerly Asiatic islands, are a\r\nrace called the Anios, the same people who form the aboriginal\r\npopulation of Jesso, and some tribes of whom also dwell on the opposite\r\nshores of Manchooria. They are uncultured and pagan savages, who dwell\r\nin huts built of rough logs, and live upon the proceeds of their fishery\r\nand the chase. Their women are ugly and little; the men are tall, lithe,\r\nstraight, and strong, with flowing hair and unkempt beard and\r\nmoustaches. Like the Samoiedes they worship the bear; feasting the\r\nliving animals on the choicest dried fish, and planting young pines\r\nround the cages in which they are kept. Their graves they regard with\r\nsimilar feelings of veneration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe other Hyperborean races do not widely differ in character and\r\nphysical appearance from those already described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n    \"Blue, and baseless, and beautiful,\r\n     Did the boundless mountains bear\r\n     Their folded shadows into the golden air.\r\n     The comfortlessness of their chasms was full\r\n     Of orient cloud and undulating mist,\r\n     Which, when their silver cataracts hissed,\r\n     Quivered with panting colour.\"\r\n                 RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Polar deserts to the icy crests of the mountains the transition\r\nis natural. There are here, so to speak, two varieties of a single\r\nclass of deserts, which we might call the Deserts of Cold, since the\r\ncoldness of the climate is the dominant cause which in both renders the\r\nsoil more and more unproductive and uninhabitable. In effect, it is not\r\nonly in departing from the Tropic Zone that we see the mean temperature\r\ngradually sinking even to the point whereat all liquids congeal and all\r\nterrestrial life becomes impossible. The same phenomenon occurs in\r\nproportion as we ascend in the atmosphere. It is a consequence of the\r\nproperties of the gaseous medium which envelops our globe, and takes\r\nplace in obedience to certain laws which science has been able to\r\nascertain and define. We know now that the decline of the temperature is\r\nalways in proportion to the elevation of places or of the atmospheric\r\nstrata; but the value of the relation which exists between the two terms\r\nmay be modified by various circumstances--such as the direction of the\r\nprevailing wind, the hygrometrical state of the atmosphere, the hour of\r\nthe day, and particularly the climate, or, to speak more exactly, the\r\nthermic latitude. The warmer the climate, the more sensible the\r\ndifference between the temperature of the air at the level of the sea\r\nand that which we observe at a certain height; greater, nevertheless, is\r\nthe height to which we must rise to find the region where the\r\nthermometer never descends below 0°, and where, consequently, the snows\r\nand ices of the mountains do not melt in any season.\r\n\r\nAs a mean, we estimate every 580 feet of elevation in the Torrid Zone as\r\nequal to one thermometrical degree, and in the Temperate Zone at one\r\ndegree for every 450 feet, the cooling of the air. That is, for every\r\n580 feet in the one instance, and every 450 feet in the other, as we\r\nascend above the sea's level, the temperature decreases one degree. In\r\nthe Polar regions the decrease of temperature is insensible up to a\r\ncertain height, which has not yet been ascertained. At Ingloolich, in\r\n69° 21' north latitude, Captain Parry flew a kite to a height of 400\r\nfeet, with an _à minima_ thermometer attached. At this elevation the\r\ntemperature of the air was 31° below zero, or the same as on the\r\nice-fields of the sea. Humboldt counted one degree of declination for\r\nevery 550 feet on Chimborazo. De Saussure obtained one degree for every\r\n440 feet on Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\nThe limit of eternal snows, or perpetual snow-line, which at the Pole\r\nsinks to the very level of ocean, rises higher and higher as it\r\napproaches the lower latitudes, and attains its maximum elevation\r\ntowards the Equinoctial Line. It follows, that in the countries\r\nbordering on the Arctic Circle, mountains of very moderate altitude show\r\nthemselves all through the year in a shroud of radiant snow; while,\r\nunder the Tropics, if we would meet with masses of eternal ice, we must\r\nmount to a height of 13,500 feet and more. The limit of the permanent\r\nsnows is, however, affected by a variety of local circumstances, such as\r\nthe neighbourhood of great seas or forests. The subjoined table,\r\ntherefore, which shows the height of the curve of congelation in\r\ndifferent latitudes, is founded upon the known law of the decrease of\r\nheat by elevation, and must be regarded rather as approximatively\r\ncorrect than strictly accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n       TABLE OF SNOW-LINE.\r\n  -------------------------------------\r\n  |           |              |        |\r\n  |           | MEAN         | HEIGHT |\r\n  |LATITUDE.  | TEMPERATURE  | OF THE |\r\n  |           | AT THE LEVEL | SNOW-  |\r\n  |           | OF THE SEA.  | LINE.  |\r\n  |           |              |        |\r\n  -------------------------------------\r\n  |           | Degrees               |\r\n  |           | Centrigrade.          |\r\n  |           |       | Degrees       |\r\n  |           |       | Fahrenheit.   |\r\n  |           |       |      | Feet.  |\r\n  |           |       |      |        |\r\n  |  0        | 29·00 | 84·2 | 15,207 |\r\n  |  1        | 28·99 | 84·2 | 15,203 |\r\n  |  2        | 28·96 | 84·1 | 15,189 |\r\n  |  4        | 28·86 | 83·9 | 15,135 |\r\n  |  5        | 28·78 | 83·8 | 15,095 |\r\n  |  6        | 28·68 | 83·6 | 15,047 |\r\n  |  7        | 28·57 | 83·4 | 14,989 |\r\n  |  8        | 28·44 | 83·2 | 14,923 |\r\n  |  9        | 28·29 | 82·9 | 14,848 |\r\n  | 10        | 28·13 | 82·6 | 14,764 |\r\n  | 15        | 27·06 | 80·7 | 14,220 |\r\n  | 20        | 25·61 | 78·1 | 13,478 |\r\n  | 25        | 23·82 | 74·9 | 12,557 |\r\n  | 30        | 21·75 | 71·1 | 11.484 |\r\n  | 35        | 19·46 | 67·0 | 10,287 |\r\n  | 40        | 17·02 | 62·6 |  9,001 |\r\n  | 45        | 14·50 | 58·1 |  7,671 |\r\n  | 50        | 11·98 | 53·6 |  6,334 |\r\n  | 51½[195]  | 11·24 | 52·3 |  5,950 |\r\n  | 54        | 10·02 | 50·0 |  5,290 |\r\n  | 55        |  9·54 | 49·2 |  5,034 |\r\n  | 56        |  9·07 | 48·3 |  4,782 |\r\n  | 57        |  8·60 | 47·5 |  4,534 |\r\n  | 58        |  8·14 | 46·6 |  4,291 |\r\n  | 60        |  7·25 | 45·0 |  3,818 |\r\n  | 65        |  5·18 | 41·3 |  2,722 |\r\n  | 70        |  3·39 | 38·1 |  1,778 |\r\n  | 75        |  1·94 | 35·5 |  1,016 |\r\n  | 80        |   ·87 | 33·6 |    457 |\r\n  | 85        |   ·22 | 32·4 |    117 |\r\n  | 86        |   ·14 | 32·3 |     76 |\r\n  | 87        |   ·08 | 32·2 |     44 |\r\n  | 88        |   ·04 | 32·1 |     20 |\r\n  | 89        |   ·01 | 32·0 |      5 |\r\n  | 90        |   ·00 | 32·0 |      0 |\r\n  |           |       |      |        |\r\n  -------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThat the foregoing table needs considerable modification in particular\r\nlocalities is evident from the following facts:--In the Scandinavian\r\nAlps, lat. 65° north, the snow-line occurs at an elevation of 5200 feet,\r\ninstead of 2722; in the Alps of Savoy, lat. 45° north, it is found at\r\n7650 feet, which is nearly that of the table. On the southern slope of\r\nthe Himalayas the traveller ascends to an elevation of upwards of 15,000\r\nfeet before he enters the realms of snow and ice, and on the northern\r\nslope to 12,750 feet. Finally, in the Andes of Bolivia, according to\r\nPentland, the curve of congelation lies between 14,400 and 14,800 feet.\r\n\r\nThus, then, in the mid Torrid Zone, we must accomplish a weary ascent of\r\n13,000 to 15,000 feet before we can find ourselves transported from the\r\ncalcined plains whose sands scorch and blister our feet, or the dense\r\nforests whose innermost depths teem with the most exuberant and\r\nbeautiful floral life, to the heart of icy deserts and the sublime\r\nsilence of the mountains. And in passing from one to the other of these\r\nextremes, we traverse in a few hours all the climates which succeed one\r\nanother from the Equator to the Pole. Nevertheless, I must point out an\r\nimportant difference between the Polar deserts and the snowy regions of\r\nthe mountains, which is wholly to the advantage of the former.\r\n\r\nI have already shown that, under the highest latitudes, men find, in the\r\nexceptional activity of their functions of nutrition, and, above all, of\r\nrespiration, a powerful re-agent against the intensity of the external\r\ncold. This resource fails him on the mountain summit. In vain will he\r\nattempt, as a succedaneum against the cold, to modify his ordinary\r\nregimen, to drink warm blood, to eat fat and raw flesh; his stomach will\r\nreject such aliment, or digest it only with difficulty, and he will not\r\nsuffer less from the extreme rigour of the temperature. At the Pole air\r\npours freely into our lungs, and its pressure stoutly maintains the\r\nequilibrium of the fluids of our body. Such is not the case when we\r\nsoar, Icarus like, into the higher regions of the atmosphere; in\r\nproportion as we ascend, the air rarefies, and its pressure diminishes.\r\nConsequently, respiration becomes difficult and painful; the quantity of\r\noxygen designed to cherish animal heat by the combustion of the carbon\r\nand hydrogen of the blood becomes insufficient; at the same time, the\r\ntissues and the liquids which they enclose expand; perspiration, instead\r\nof diminishing, experiences a relative augmentation; if the atmospheric\r\npressure is much too weak, the blood extravasates, and forces itself out\r\nthrough the nose, the ears, and the pores of the skin. In a word, that\r\npeculiar malady which has been named the _mal des montagnes_, and which\r\nis not always unattended with danger, attacks the hardiest traveller,\r\nand compels him with all speed to return to lower and securer levels.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we speak of \"the pure and living air\" of the mountains,\r\nof the vigour and health of their inhabitants--even as the poet says--\r\n\r\n    \"An iron race the mountain-cliffs maintain\"--\r\n\r\nwe are really to understand those lofty hills which are decorated in\r\nsome places with the name of mountains, or the table-lands that form the\r\nfirst steps of the great chains. Such, indeed, are the only inhabited\r\nand inhabitable mountains. There only is the cultivation of a few plants\r\nstill possible; there only can the wild beasts find an asylum in wood or\r\nforest, and the cattle green fields of pasture; there may man plant his\r\nfeet, build his dwellings, devote himself to rearing his herds, to the\r\nchase, or to more sedentary industries. Let us remember, moreover, that\r\nthe salubrity of the air of elevated districts has been greatly\r\nexaggerated, and that if we meet with many mountaineers agile, robust,\r\nand intelligent, we also meet with a great number affected by organic\r\ndiseases either wholly unknown or very rare in the plains, such as\r\ngoître, scrofula, and cretinism.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the mountains, their form, and the nature of their\r\nsoil, suffice, even without these meteorological conditions I have just\r\nindicated, to render them impracticable as the dwelling-place of man and\r\nof most animals. To ascend them is almost always an enterprise of the\r\nmost hazardous, frequently of the most perilous character. To climb the\r\nlofty peaks of the Himalaya, to scale the majestic brow of Chimborazo,\r\nto ascend the frozen sides of the Jungfrau or Mont Blanc, is an\r\nachievement of which the boldest boast, as if they had won a Waterloo or\r\nan Inkermann! Only a keen longing after that notoriety which for some\r\nminds fills the place of renown, or a passion for dangerous enterprise\r\nsuch as stimulates the pioneer or the explorer, or a powerful scientific\r\nand artistic interest, can impel the Alpine adventurer--can instigate a\r\nSaussure, a Forbes, a Pentland, or a Tyndall, to mount the scarped\r\nramparts of primeval rocks, to tread warily along precipices which the\r\nchamois can scarcely traverse, to escalade the savage cliffs and frozen\r\npinnacles, and to breathe\r\n\r\n    \"The difficult air of the iced mountain-tops.\"\r\n\r\nThe annals of mountaineering are illuminated with many stirring stories\r\nof human endurance, patience, and heroism; but, alas! the page is too\r\noften robed in black, and too frequently records the death of some\r\nunhappy explorer!\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my plan to trace the geological history of mountains.\r\nWe know that their formation has been attributed, according to a\r\nsatisfactory theory, to the upheavals and expansions of the igneous\r\nmatter which, in the primitive ages, boiled under the solid crust\r\nproduced by the superficial solidification of our planet, and whose\r\nebullition, though considerably decreased, even in our own days is\r\nfrequently made known in volcanic phenomena and earthquakes. At divers\r\nepochs the crust of the globe will have been rent and dislocated, giving\r\nvent to floods of fused mineral matter; these, solidifying in their\r\nturn, will have produced those inequalities of the earth's surface which\r\nwe call mountains; enormous inequalities, as they appear to us;\r\nmole-hills or grains of sand if we compare them with the volume of the\r\nterrestrial sphere.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the mountains over the surface of the continents and\r\nislands, and the forms which they have assumed, seem, at the first\r\nglance, altogether capricious and irregular. Yet an attentive study\r\nspeedily demonstrates that some higher law than that of chance presided\r\nat the violent and tumultuous production of these majestic masses. Thus,\r\nin the first place, it is evident that every mountain not a volcano\r\nconnects itself of necessity to other mountains, and forms a _chain_ of\r\ngreater or less length, which departs a little from the straight line,\r\nor rather from the arc of the great circle. The principal chains throw\r\nout branches, and by _mountain knots_, as they are called, unite with\r\nother secondary chains--the whole composing a _mountain system_; but the\r\napparent irregularities of these systems may always be referred to one\r\ncommon direction.\r\n\r\nIf from the disposition of mountains we pass to their distribution, we\r\nperceive that all chains which have sprung from the same geological\r\nconvulsion are always distinctly parallel, and the successive chains\r\ndistinctly perpendicular among themselves; so that the age of a chain is\r\nknown by its direction. Nor is there anything to astonish us in this\r\nspecies of symmetry, when we recollect that every substance previously\r\nliquefied or diluted by heat, and which, while cooling, becomes\r\ncontracted by the closer compression of its atoms, splits with a certain\r\ndegree of regularity, generally following lines which intersect each\r\nother at right angles. And it is through the crevices of the cooled\r\nterrestrial crust that these fused matters have escaped, according to\r\nthe hypothesis generally admitted by geologists, which, by solidifying\r\nin their turn, have created the mountains. I can only indicate these\r\nconsiderations to the reader; their development would beguile us too far\r\nfrom our prescribed path.\r\n\r\nIf we direct our attention now to the configuration of mountains, we\r\nshall see that this configuration depends essentially on the nature of\r\nthe rocks which constitute them. Granite, for example, is one of those\r\nwhich offers the most varied outlines, as the reader may see without\r\nquitting the United Kingdom, in the rugged, fantastic, broken masses of\r\nthe Argyllshire Highlands, that hem in the waters of Loch Goil and Loch\r\nLong. Granite abounds in the tropical zone, and seems to prefer chains\r\nof moderate elevation. Granite heights are generally distinguished by\r\nabrupt and polished flanks, pointed or dentelated summits, scarped\r\napproaches, deeply fissured slopes, and narrow, wild, and profound\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nGneiss, a felspathic and micaceous rock, of schistous structure, is\r\nfound in layers sometimes horizontal or gently inclined, sometimes\r\nundulating and complicated towards the border. The contours of the\r\ngneiss mountains are less cloven than those of mountains of granite;\r\nbut numerous fissures and indentations are still discoverable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ORGAN MOUNTAINS OF RIO JANEIRO.]\r\n\r\nPorphyry generally occurs in isolated peaks, with almost vertical\r\nflanks; seldom in continuous chains. Porphyritic mountains, says M.\r\nMaury, imprint on the landscape a peculiarly picturesque character. This\r\nrock sometimes appears under the form of tall pillars set in close\r\njuxtaposition--it is then known as _columnar porphyry_; and to groups of\r\nthese columns have been given in some countries the name of _Orgues_ or\r\n_Organs_, on account of their resemblance to the organ pipes which\r\ndiscourse solemn music in our cathedrals.\r\n\r\nThus: in Mexico two mountains occur distinguished by this appellation,\r\n_Los Organos_; one is that of Mamanchota, situated to the north of the\r\nIndian village of Actapan. The portion soaring out of the rock, says\r\nHumboldt, is three hundred feet in height; but the absolute elevation of\r\nthe summit of the mountain, at the point where the Organos begin to\r\nshoot aloft, is 1385 toises (about 5310 feet). The other is the Jacal,\r\nwhich is nearly 9600 feet above the sea-level, and crowned with forests\r\nof pine and cedar.\r\n\r\nBut the most celebrated Organ Mountains are those which rear their\r\nglittering shafts at the extremity of the bay of Rio Janiero. \"It is not\r\nonly the aspect of these pointed summits,\" says Dr. Yvan, \"that reminds\r\nthe spectator of the sublime instrument of our churches; the strange\r\nsounds which escape from between these cylinders of rock render the\r\nanalogy still more striking, and complete the illusion. The voice of the\r\ntempest, the lamentations of the forests bowed by the passing winds, the\r\ndoleful wails of the jaguars, the cries of the howling monkeys passing\r\nbetween these sonorous peaks, produce a harmony before which all human\r\ninstrumentation loses its grandeur. We feel that it is the universal\r\nsoul which inspires the chords of the majestic keys. The _Serra dos\r\nOrganos_ is clothed in virgin forest over three-fourths of its extent;\r\nit is only at long intervals, and in obscure valleys, that we encounter\r\nany traces of human industry, or that we traverse some circular treeless\r\nhollows, in which an abundant herbage flourishes, and feeds the troops\r\nof horses and oxen enclosed in these natural parks.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Organ Mountains_ of Epailly (in the department of the Haute Loire,\r\nin France) and of Bart (in the Corrèze), and the _Colonnades_ of\r\nChenavari (in the Ardèche), belong to the basaltic formation, rendered\r\nso remarkable by its frequent arrangement in prismatic columns of\r\nextreme regularity. Basalt also gives birth to chains which resemble\r\nvast walls, and sometimes appears in the form of pyramids, plateaux, or\r\nsimple mamelons.\r\n\r\nOf the columnar arrangement the Palisades, on the banks of the river\r\nHudson, may be particularized as a noble example; but a still grander\r\nspectacle is presented on the river Columbia, west of the Rocky\r\nMountains, where the waters pour through a valley walled on either side\r\nwith tier upon tier of pillars, to the height of fully a thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe Trachytes, massive rocks of excessive roughness, occasionally appear\r\nin the shape of cones, at times in that of domes or enormous balloons,\r\nand at times as cupolas with spire-like points, like minarets. The\r\nchalks, the sandstones, the diorites, have all their characteristic\r\naspect, and give to the mountains where they dominate, and to the\r\nlandscapes which surround them, an easily recognizable physiognomy. And,\r\nfinally, everybody knows the particular configuration affected by the\r\nvolcanic mountains.\r\n\r\nThe great mountain-chains are unequally distributed in different parts\r\nof the world, and their disposition varies in a remarkable manner in the\r\ntwo great continents. For the most part it agrees with the direction of\r\nthe principal land masses in each. Thus, in the Old World, the chief\r\nranges assume an easterly and westerly course, following the parallels\r\nof latitude; in the New, a northerly and southerly direction, like that\r\nof the meridians of longitude.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the mountains are numerous, but generally of very moderate\r\nelevation. In the north, we find the _Scandinavian Alps_, covering\r\nnearly the whole of Norway and some part of Sweden. From the Naze, or\r\nCape Lindesnaes, they roll far away, like foam-crested billows, to the\r\nvery shore of the Frozen Sea. The central and highest part of the mass,\r\nbetween latitude 62° and 63°, is called the Dover-feld; the more\r\nnortherly portion, the Koelin Mountains; the more southerly, Lang-feld\r\nand Hardanger-feld. Their summits are comparatively flat--felds, or\r\nfields, as the name indicates; on the eastern side they slope gradually\r\nto the plains bordering the Gulf of Bothnia, their sides clothed with\r\ndense forests of pine and fir; on the west they rise abruptly from the\r\nmargin of the ocean, and their steep, barren, and swarthy flanks are\r\nbroken up by numerous inlets, or _fiords_, where the waters lie cradled\r\nin gloom and desolation. Their highest point is now known to be\r\nSkags-tol-tind, in the Lang-feld range, upwards of 8000 feet. All the\r\nloftier summits rise above the snow-line, and wear night and day,\r\nwinter and summer, a shroud of frost and snow. The glaciers are often of\r\ngreat magnificence, and equal, if they do not transcend in sublimity,\r\nthose of the Alps of Switzerland and Savoy.\r\n\r\nThe _Mountains of Scotland_ seldom exceed 3500 feet in height; the\r\nprincipal summits, however, Ben Mac-Dhui, and Ben Nevis, are\r\nrespectively, 4390 and 4368 feet. Ben Lawers, on the west side of Loch\r\nTay, reaches 3984 feet; Ben More, in the south-west of Perthshire, 3818\r\nfeet; and Schehallion, 3514 feet. Ben Lomond, east of the famous lake of\r\nthat name, has an altitude of 3191 feet. The characteristics of the\r\nScotch mountains are their barren sides, only relieved by patches of\r\npurple heather; their originally fantastic and broken outlines; their\r\ndeep, narrow, savage glens, which are often of the gloomiest and most\r\ndesolate aspect; and their still deep tarns, or lakes, mirroring each\r\nlofty height in their clear and glassy surface.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the European systems is that of the _Alps_, whose\r\nmajestic and glorious landscapes have been for ages the admiration of\r\nthe poet and the artist. They begin, on the west, near the head of the\r\nGulf of Savoy; sweep round the upper portion of Italy, as if to shut out\r\nthat historic peninsula from the European mainland; bend to the\r\nsouth-east to approach the Adriatic; and throw out a spur, or\r\nprolongation, along the eastern shore of that sea, and parallel with it.\r\nThat portion of the system which borders the Mediterranean is\r\ndistinguished as the Maritime Alps; between Italy on the one side, and\r\nFrance and Savoy on the other, lie the Cottian and Graian Alps; from\r\nMont Blanc to Monte Rosa stretch the Pennine Alps; further to the\r\neastward extend the Lepontine, Rhetian, and Noric Alps; and\r\nsouth-easterly, the Carnic, the Julian, and the Dinaric Alps. The\r\nBernese Alps form the northern barrier of the Valley of the Rhone; their\r\ndirection is parallel to that of the Pennine.[196]\r\n\r\nThe principal Alpine summits are:--Mont Blanc, the \"monarch of\r\nmountains,\" 15,750 feet; Monte Rosa, 15,150 feet; Finster-Aarhorn,\r\n14,109; the Jungfrau, 13,716; and the Ortler Spits, 12,852 feet. The\r\nscenery of the Alps is always of the grandest character; its more\r\nremarkable features being its huge glaciers, or ice-rivers, with their\r\nbrilliant and ever-changing hues.\r\n\r\n    \"Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!\r\n     Who made you glorious as the gates of heaven\r\n     Beneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun\r\n     Clothe you with rainbows? Who, with living flowers\r\n     Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet.\"[197]\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that there are at least four hundred of the great\r\nglaciers, varying from three to thirty miles in length, from a hundred\r\nto six or seven hundred feet in thickness, and from a few yards to a\r\ncouple of miles in breadth. The total superficial area of the glaciers\r\nin Switzerland, Savoy, Piedmont, and the Tyrol, has been estimated at\r\n1400 square miles.\r\n\r\nThe _Apennines_ must be considered a subsidiary portion of the Alps,\r\nrather than as an independent system. They branch off from the Maritime\r\nAlps, and traverse the entire length of Italy. Several peaks rise to an\r\nelevation of between 7000 and 8000 feet; but the average height scarcely\r\nexceeds 3000 feet. Monte Coma, the culminating point, is 9523 feet.\r\n\r\nThe south of Italy is occupied by a remarkable volcanic region, where\r\nthe subterranean fires still give awful signs of their intense activity.\r\n_Mount Vesuvius_, which raises its conical mass, girdled with vines and\r\nchestnuts, above the fair city of Naples, is 3978 feet above the\r\nsea-level. Its sister volcano, _Mount Etna_, in the island of Sicily,\r\nattains a far loftier elevation (10,872 feet),[198] and exhibits a\r\ncharming variety of picturesque scenery. The forest region on the lower\r\nslopes is rich in glowing effects of colour, while near the summit the\r\nlandscapes wear a grander aspect. Mr. Matthew Arnold has painted an\r\nEtnean picture with marvellous force in the following beautiful\r\npassage.[199]\r\n\r\n                            \"'Tis the last\r\n    Of all the woody, high, well watered dells\r\n    On Etna; and the beam\r\n    Of noon is broken there by chestnut boughs\r\n    Down its steep verdant sides; the air\r\n    Is freshened by the leaping stream, which throws\r\n    Eternal showers of spray on the mossed roots\r\n    Of trees, and vines of turf, and long dark shoots\r\n    Of ivy-plants, and fragrant hanging bells\r\n    Of hyacinths, and on late anemones,\r\n    That muffle its wet banks; but glade,\r\n    And stream, and sward, and chestnut trees,\r\n    End here; Etna beyond, in the broad glare\r\n    Of the hot noon, without a shade,\r\n    Slope behind slope, up to the peak, lies bare;\r\n    The peak, round which the white clouds play.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBetween France and Spain lies the great system of the _Pyrenees_, whose\r\ntopmost peaks exceed 11,000 feet in altitude. Their entire breadth\r\naverages between forty and fifty miles; the southern slope is\r\nexceedingly rugged and abrupt, and the passes or defiles exhibit a\r\ncharacter of exceeding savageness. The two loftiest crests are Mount\r\nMaladetta, 11,426 feet, and Mont Perdu, 11,275 feet. The interior of\r\nSpain consists of an elevated table-land, bordered by the wild\r\nmountain-ranges of the _Sierra Nevada_ and the _Sierra Morena_. The\r\naverage height of the snowy chain of the Nevada is 6000 feet, but the\r\nPeak of Mulharen soars to the noble elevation of 11,678 feet.\r\n\r\nIn France, we meet with the chains of the _Cevennes_ and the _Vosges_,\r\nthe former extending along the right bank of the Rhone, with an average\r\naltitude of 3000 feet; the latter stretching from north to south along\r\nthe right bank of the Rhine. The vine-clad slopes of the latter offer\r\nmany a romantic picture to the wayfarer in Rhineland. Very curious in\r\ngeological interest are the extinct volcanic mountains of Auvergne; so\r\nblack, charred, scathed, and desolate, that one might suppose them to\r\nhave been the scene of some old-world battle between the Titans and the\r\nOlympian gods. Here the Puy de Sancy exceeds 6000 feet (6215), and the\r\nnow silent cone of the Puy de Dôme, 4500 feet in height.\r\n\r\nThe _Hungarian Mountains_, or Mountains of Germany, occupy the country\r\nbetween the Rhine and the eighteenth meridian of east longitude. Here we\r\nmeet with the dark and densely wooded crests of the Schwarz Wald, or\r\nBlack Forest; the Erz-Gebirge, on the borders of Saxony and Bohemia; and\r\nthe rich metalliferous masses of the legend-haunted Harz. Continuing our\r\nsurvey to the eastward, our glances rest on the bold and many-peaked\r\ngroups of the _Carpathians_, which, commencing near the sources of the\r\nOder and the Vistula, describe a semicircle round the fertile Hungarian\r\nplain for between seven and eight hundred miles. Striking down to the\r\nDanube, it faces on the opposite side the lofty wall of the Balkan, and\r\nthrough the gorge thus formed, the famous \"Iron Gates\" of ancient story,\r\nthe river rolls its waters with impetuous rapidity. The more elevated\r\nsummits of the Carpathians possess an average height of 5000 feet, but\r\nMount Lomnitz reaches the loftier level of 7962 feet.\r\n\r\nOn the borders of Asia lies the long and narrow chain, or rather chains,\r\nof the _Ural Mountains_, with an average altitude of from 2000 to 2500\r\nfeet, sinking in about latitude 57° to a rocky ridge of little more than\r\n1100 feet. The loftiest crest is Mount Yaman, in latitude 54° 13', 5387\r\nfeet. The Ural Mountains possess abundant mineral treasures, both gold\r\nand platinum occurring in extensive abundance.\r\n\r\nThe chain of _Mount Caucasus_ stretches for about 700 miles between the\r\nBlack and Caspian Seas, in the direction of north-west and south-east.\r\nIt exceeds 150 miles in breadth, throwing out from the central mass\r\nnumerous branches and parallel ridges, and enclosing a network of\r\nvalleys, plains, and ravines. The culminating point appears to be the\r\ngroup or mountain-knot of Elburz, in the meridian of 42° 25' E., which\r\nattains the stupendous elevation of 18,493 feet. Kasbek, which is really\r\nin Asia, reaches 16,500 feet.\r\n\r\nIn the Asiatic continent the grandest mountain-system is that of the\r\n_Himalayas_ (or \"Snowy Mountains\"), which limit the Thibetan table-land\r\non the south, and divide it from the hot plains of northern India. They\r\nextend in an east and west direction for about 1500 miles, with a\r\nbreadth of from 200 to 250; and consist of a number of parallel ranges,\r\ndivided by transverse valleys, and rising one above another like a\r\nseries of gigantic terraces. The slopes are clothed with an exceedingly\r\nrich and beautiful flora, and far up to the very snow-line extend\r\nmagnificent breadths of forest foliage.[200] On the southern slope this\r\nsnow-line is about 15,000 feet high; on the northern, 18,000 feet. The\r\nloftiest summit of the Himalayas, and probably the very apex of our\r\nglobe, is _Mount Everest_ (latitude 27° 59'), 29,002 feet in altitude.\r\n_Kunchin-jinga_ is 28,156 feet; _Dhawalgiri_, 28,000 feet; and\r\n_Javaher_, 25,746 feet above the ocean-level.\r\n\r\n\"As we ascend the exterior face of these mountains,\"[201] says Captain\r\nStrachey, \"tropical vegetation prevails to a height of about 4000 feet,\r\nthough even from 3000 feet a few of the forms of colder climates begin\r\nto appear; the vegetation, however, is, on the whole, scanty on this\r\ndeclivity. Far different is it when we follow the same zone of elevation\r\ninto the interior of the mountains, along the courses of the larger\r\nrivers, which, owing to the great depths of their valleys, carry a\r\ntropical flora into the very heart of the mountain region. The sheltered\r\nand confined beds of these rivers, where the two great requisites for\r\ntropical vegetation, heat and humidity, are at their maximum, often\r\nafford the finest specimens of forest scenery, varied by an admixture of\r\nthe temperate forms of vegetable life, which here descend to their\r\nlowest level. Thus the traveller's eye may rest on palms and acacias\r\nintermingled with pines; on oaks or maples covered with epiphytal\r\norchideæ; while pothos and clematis, bamboos and ivy, fill up the\r\nstrangely contrasted picture.\r\n\r\n\"Above 4000 feet oaks and rhododendrons greatly increase in number, and\r\nthese trees, with andromeda (_Pieris_), form the great mass of the\r\nforest from 6000 to 8000 feet. Species of the deciduous trees of the\r\ntemperate zone are gradually introduced as we rise, and these again,\r\nwith the addition of other pines, prevail in the upper regions of\r\nforest--that is, from 8000 to 11,500 feet.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HIMALAYAS--MOUNT GAURISANKAR (28,000 FEET).]\r\n\r\nGlaciers abound in the loftier Himalayas. The lowest elevation to which\r\nthey descend is about 11,500 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe _Altai Mountains_ lie north of Mongolia, with an average elevation\r\nof from 5000 to 7000 feet. Eternal snow crowns their loftiest summit,\r\nMount Bielukha, 11,063 feet. In Central Asia we find the chains of the\r\n_Thian-shan_, partly volcanic, and the _Kuen-lun_, which are little\r\nknown, but probably lift their towering heads to an altitude of fully\r\n20,000 feet. China is traversed from west to east by two\r\nmountain-ranges, the Pe-ling and Nan-ling, or \"Northern\" and \"Southern,\"\r\nwhich prolong their rocky heights to the very shores of the Pacific.\r\nWest of the table-land of Pamer the eye rests upon the formidable chain\r\nof the _Beloor-tagh_, from 18,000 to 20,000 feet in elevation; and on\r\nthe borders of Central Asia the Himalaya, the Beloor-tagh and other\r\nchains unite in the colossal knot or group of the _Hindoo-Koosh_.\r\nThence, with a westerly course, extend the _Paropamisan_ and _Caspian\r\nMountains_, the latter culminating in Mount Demavend, 14,300 feet, near\r\nthe Caspian Sea. The _Soleiman Mountains_ border on the rugged plateau\r\nof Afghanistan; in Armenia rises the fable-haunted crest of Agri-dagh,\r\nor _Mount Ararat_, 17,260 feet; while, in Asia Minor, the Taurus chain,\r\nwhich so often beheld the banners and glancing spears of the Romans,\r\nattains its loftiest in _Mount Argæus_, or Arjish-dagh, 13,100 feet; and\r\nalong the coast of Syria rolls the undulating range of _Lebanon_, with\r\nMount Hermon soaring to 9600 feet. Arabia is occupied by a branch of the\r\nLebanon, which runs southward into the Sinaitic peninsula. The highest\r\nof the Sinai Mountains is 9300 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe average altitude of the _Ghauts_, which line the east and west\r\ncoasts of Hindostan, is 3000 feet; but some of their summits aspire to\r\n8000 feet.\r\n\r\nA range of high mountains traverses the dreary peninsula of Kamtschatka,\r\nand appears to be a continuation of the volcanic chain which forms the\r\nKurile Islands, and extends even to Japan and the great islands of the\r\nEastern Archipelago. Many of the Kamtschatkan volcanoes are still\r\nactive, such as Avatsha, Kluchevsky, and Assachnish, and though shrouded\r\nin snow and ice project from their seething caldrons vast showers of\r\nashes, stones, boiling water, and lava. Avatsha is 9600 feet high.\r\n\r\nThe Indian islands contain many colossal mountains, mostly, if not all,\r\nof a volcanic character, and the same generalization is true of the\r\nbeautiful Polynesian archipelagos:--\r\n\r\n    \"Summer-isles of Eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea.\"\r\n\r\nMount Ophir, in Sumatra, is 13,840 feet high; Stamat, in Java, 12,300\r\nfeet; Indiapura, in Sumatra, 12,140 feet; Tomboro, in the island of\r\nSumbawa, 7600 feet; and Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands, 3970 feet.\r\nKina-balu, in Borneo, is a magnificent mass, 13,968 feet in height. \"Its\r\ngrand precipices,\" says a traveller,[202] \"its polished granite surfaces\r\nglittering under the bright tropical rays, the dashing cascades, which\r\nfall from so great a height as to dissolve in spray before being lost in\r\nthe dark valleys below, have a magical effect upon the imagination.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy rapid survey of the mountain-systems of the globe now brings both\r\nwriter and reader to the African Continent, which contains, however, an\r\nunusually large proportion of plain and low level. The northern\r\nmountain-ranges, which extend from east to west parallel to the\r\nMediterranean, are known to geographers under the general appellation of\r\n_Mount Atlas_, whose culminating point occurs in the peak of Miltoin,\r\n11,400 feet, to the south-east of the city of Morocco.\r\n\r\nIn the north-eastern part of the continent lie the _Mountains of\r\nAbyssinia_, the highest pinnacle being that of Geesh, which towers at an\r\nelevation of 15,000 feet above the sea. Many other summits are also\r\ncrowned with \"snows eternal,\" feeding a succession of streams which pour\r\ntheir waters into the White Nile.\r\n\r\nDetached masses and mountain-groups spread along the western coast,\r\nbetween the 12th and 18th parallels of north and south latitude\r\nrespectively. To the north of the Equator lie the _Kong Mountains_; and\r\nnear the coast of the Bight of Biafra rises the semi-extinct volcano of\r\nthe _Camaroons_, 13,129 feet high. This elevation is far exceeded by\r\nthat of the colossal summits, which on the eastern coast are situated\r\nwithin a few degrees of the equinoctial line, and wear a crown of snow\r\nwhich is indissoluble. One of these, _Kilimandjaro_, has an altitude of\r\n22,814 feet, while _Kenia_ cannot be less than 20,000 feet. Others are\r\nprobably equal, or little inferior, to these in height.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa are three ranges of mountains, or rather terraces, the\r\nnorthernmost of which is called the _Nieuweld_, and runs in a general\r\ncourse of east and west. Towards its eastern extremity it bears the name\r\nof the _Sneeaberg_, or Snowy Mountain, and its summits are frequently\r\n1000 feet high. The _Compassberg_ group is 7000 feet in elevation.\r\nImmediately to the south of Cape Town rises the curious flat-topped\r\n_Table Mountain_, 3582 feet in height. The _Peak of Teneriffe_, in the\r\nCanary Isles, off the north-west coast, is volcanic; it rises 12,236\r\nfeet above the sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAsia possesses, as we have seen, the loftiest mountain-peaks, but it is\r\non the American continent we meet with the grandest mountain-systems. We\r\nremark, in the first place, that they are all directed from north to\r\nsouth; in the second, that they are grouped along the western and\r\neastern coasts in two unequal systems, converging towards each other as\r\nthey run southward. In North America these two systems are the _Rocky\r\nMountains_ on the west; and the _Apalachian_, or _Alleghany_, on the\r\neast. The former consists of a mountain-region, diversified with\r\nvalleys, terraces, and plateaus, varying in breadth from 40 to 100\r\nmiles, and raising several summits to a very conspicuous elevation, as\r\nin Mount Brown, 15,900 feet, and the volcanic peak of Mount Elias, in\r\nCalifornia, 17,500 feet.\r\n\r\nThe _Apalachian_ range extends from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the\r\nparallel of 34°, a course of 1500 miles. It is intersected by Lake\r\nChamplain and the valley of the Hudson. Its average height does not\r\nexceed 3000 feet; but it culminates in Mount Washington to an altitude\r\nof 6234 feet.\r\n\r\nIn South America the chain of the Rocky Mountains is prolonged in the\r\nmagnificent system of the _Cordilleras de los Andes_, or the Andes,\r\nwhich commences immediately to the southward of the Isthmus of Panama,\r\nextends along the whole stretch of the western coast, and finally\r\nterminates in the rocky archipelago of Tierra del Fuego. This chain is\r\nlocally distinguished into the Columbian, Peruvian, Bolivian, Chilian,\r\nand Patagonian Andes. Its widest extension occurs between the 20th and\r\n25th parallels, where it measures upwards of 400 miles across.\r\nThroughout its entire course it attains a very considerable elevation.\r\nIts volcanic character is very marked. Thus, in the Columbian Andes,\r\n_Antisana_ and _Cotopaxi_ are still active; in the Chilian, _Aconcagua_\r\nis the loftiest volcano on the globe; in the Patagonian, four active\r\nvolcanoes occur. The region at the base of the Chilian Andes suffers\r\nmore from volcanic convulsion than any other part of the world, and its\r\ntowns are repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe principal summits are:--Aconcagua, 23,944 feet; Chimborazo, 21,415\r\nfeet; Sahama, 22,350 feet; Cotopaxi, 18,867; Antisana, 19,136 feet;\r\nSorata, 21,286 feet; and Illimanni, 21,149 feet.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern coast we meet with the Mountains of Guiana and the\r\nMountains of Brazil, never reaching a higher level than 5000 feet.\r\n_Mount Sarmiento_, in Tierra del Fuego, is 6900 feet above the sea. In\r\nthe West Indies the loftiest point is found in the _Blue Mountains_ of\r\nJamaica, 7278 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE LIFE AND ANIMAL LIFE IN THE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same changes that we observe in the characters of vegetable life as\r\nwe advance towards the Pole reproduce themselves, the reader will easily\r\nunderstand, as we ascend the mountain-sides. Only, in the former case\r\nthe gradation is slow and scarcely perceptible; in the latter, it\r\ndisplays itself rapidly; in such wise that a distance of a few hundred\r\nyards in height is equivalent to a journey of several degrees in\r\nlatitude. It is scarcely necessary to add that the warmer the climate,\r\nthe higher we must rise to reach the belt or zone where flourish the\r\nspecies peculiar to Arctic countries.\r\n\r\nIn every land the flora of the lowest region of the mountains is\r\nvirtually the same as that of the adjacent plains, and it is only at an\r\nelevation of 300 feet that we discern a positive change of aspect. In\r\ntemperate Europe, the Normandy fir and the _Epicea_ begin to form, at\r\nthat altitude, forests of considerable extent. These trees are from 120\r\nto 150 feet in height, with a pyramidal configuration, sombre foliage,\r\nand drooping boughs, and whose bark takes to itself a clothing of\r\nvarious lichens (notably _Usneas_), the long filaments, branchy and\r\nyellowish, clinging to the branches of the most aged individuals. In the\r\nshadow of these resinous trees thrive the honeysuckle, the rose, the\r\nwild raspberry. At the base of the senile trunks are developed the\r\ncrawling or climbing stems, ever verdurous, of various lycopodiums. In\r\nrocky localities the great yellow gentian unfolds its long spikes of\r\ngolden flowers, in company with the elegant martagon, whose\r\nyellow-spotted red corollas are rolled up turban-wise. At a higher\r\nlevel, between 4500 and 6000 feet, the cembro pine, rare enough in\r\nFrance and England, more common in the mountains of Central Europe, and\r\nthe larch, whose leaves fall every winter, are the last representatives\r\nof the true arborescent Flora.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Fir, with bearded Usnea. 2. Great Yellow Gentian. 3.\r\nMartagon, or Turk's Cap Lily.]\r\n\r\nStill continuing our ascent, we meet now with nothing but an herbaceous\r\nvegetation. Here and there only, in turfy places and abrupt ravines, a\r\nfew birches and some dwarf willows display themselves, scarcely taller\r\nthan the herbs which surround them. It is in the rocky hollows also that\r\nthe oleanders or ferruginous rhododendrons vegetate, sole\r\nrepresentatives in Europe of a genus which among the Asiatic mountains\r\nnumbers several species. The Flora of the Alpine prairies is, moreover,\r\nextremely varied. The Gramineæ dominate therein, but associated with\r\nother families which enamel with the most brilliant colours the bright\r\ngreen carpet of those cold regions; the bright yellow or orange of the\r\nCompositæ; the blue of the Phyteumas, of the Larkspurs, and the\r\nCampanulas; the rose of the Carnations and the Centaureas; the intense\r\npurple of the Ranunculuses (_Nigritellæ_). In the most arid localities\r\nwe admire the azure flowers of the little Gentianellas and the white\r\nblossoms of the Saxifrages; their presence, under such conditions,\r\nfilling our souls with wonder, and stimulating our hearts to praise\r\ntheir divine Creator.\r\n\r\n    \"And with childlike, credulous affection,\r\n       We behold their tender buds expand--\r\n     Emblems of our own great resurrection,\r\n       Emblems of the bright and better land.\"[203]\r\n\r\nSome of the plants which enrich the lofty slopes of the European\r\nmountains are endowed with an agreeable aromatic odour, and with keen\r\nstimulating properties. Such are the _Artemisias_ and the _Achilleæ_. To\r\nthe former of these families belongs the _Artemisia glacialis_, which\r\nthe mountaineers consider an universal panacea, and which enters into\r\nthe composition of the famous liqueur of the Chartreux.\r\n\r\nOn the threshold of the eternal snows, under the influence of the icy\r\nbreezes, vegetation grows rarer and yet rarer, until it is reduced to a\r\nfew species which compensate for their insignificance by their beauty.\r\nSuch are the Campanula of Allioni, with its graceful bells of blue; the\r\ndelicate Saxifraga, whose rosy flowers also expose their beauties on the\r\nfrost-bound shores of Spitzbergen; the Soldanella of the Alps; the\r\nRanunculus of the Glaciers; numerous Androsellæ, some of which do not\r\nexceed a third of an inch in height; finally, on the extreme border, and\r\nstraggling even on the moraines of the Glaciers, where no other plant\r\ncan live, the little Myosotis, which grows in small tufts covered with\r\nwhite down, and starred with delicate blue flowers. At a still higher\r\nlevel we find only a few lichens relieving the monotonous surface of the\r\nrocks; and sometimes, flourishing under unknown circumstances, the\r\n_Protococcus nivalis_, whose red globules communicate to the snow a\r\nblood-red tint.\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Flora will offer us, in other parts of the globe, the same\r\nseries of diminution, commencing with the groups which people the low\r\nlands of each geographical zone, and terminating with those which, at\r\nthe level of the sea, are met with only in the Frozen Zone. Some\r\nmountain-chains, however, possess genera or species exclusively\r\nbelonging to them. It is on the ridges of Atlas and Lebanon, at an\r\nelevation of 3500 or 5400 feet, that the majestic cedars spread their\r\numbrageous branches. The cedars of Atlas attain a stature of 120 to 140\r\nfeet, and their trunk measures, at the base, from a yard to a yard and a\r\nhalf in diameter. \"When young,\" says M. Charles Martins,[204] \"they have\r\na pyramidal form; but when they soar above their neighbours, or above\r\nthe rock which protects them, there comes a sudden storm, a flash of\r\nlightning, or an insect pierces their terminal shoot, and deprives them\r\nof their shapely spire; the tree is discrowned; then the branches spread\r\nhorizontally in terraces or layers of verdure, one upon another,\r\nscreening the sky from the gaze of the traveller, who presses forward in\r\na sort of twilight under these vaults impenetrable to the solar rays.\r\nFrom an elevated point of the mountain still more majestic is the\r\nspectacle. The horizontal surfaces resemble lawns of the deepest green,\r\nor of a glaucous colour like that of water, upon which are sprinkled\r\ncones of a violet hue; the eye plunges into an abyss of greenery in\r\nwhose depth mutters an invisible torrent.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CEDAR OF LEBANON.]\r\n\r\nThe cedar of Atlas constitutes, if not a species, at least a distinct\r\nvariety from the cedar of Lebanon. The latter is now very rare on the\r\nmountain which is regarded as its native habitat. The prophet Ezekiel\r\ndescribes it in all its glory: \"A cedar with fair branches, and with a\r\nshadowing shroud, and of a high stature ... his height was exalted above\r\nall the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his\r\nbranches became long, because of the multitude of waters, when he shot\r\nforth\" (Ezek. xxxi. 3, 5). But those immense green forests which once\r\nstood out in dark deep shadow against the radiant sky are now reduced to\r\na single scanty grove--a grove containing, according to Dr. Hooker, but\r\nfour hundred trees, and of these four hundred only twelve of the ancient\r\nmajestic race. They are situated high up on the western slope of the\r\nmountain-range, two hours south-east from Tripoli, and at an elevation\r\nabove the sea-level of 6172 feet. Most of the Lebanon patriarchs are\r\nabout 50 feet in height, and of nearly the same girth. One, however,\r\nmeasures 63 feet in circumference.\r\n\r\nThe cedar was introduced into England towards the close of the\r\nseventeenth century, and has become permanently naturalized. It is even\r\nfound in a flourishing condition as far north as Inverness. It does not,\r\nhowever, attain such gigantic dimensions here as on the slopes of\r\nLebanon. There is one at Goodwood, in Sussex, 25 feet in circumference;\r\nand another at Peperharrow, in Surrey, 15 feet. In the Jardin des\r\nPlantes a celebrated tree, whose terminal shoot was struck by a chance\r\nshot during the siege of the Bastile, boasts of the following\r\nproportions:-Ten feet girth at three feet from the ground, and ten feet\r\nand a half on a level with the soil. Its horizontal branches extend\r\nfully forty-five to fifty feet in length, and cover, consequently, a\r\nsurface of upwards of 300 feet in circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RHODODENDRONS OF THE HIMALAYA.\r\n\r\n1. Rhododendron Pendulum. 2. Rhododendron Dalhousie. 3. Rhododendron\r\nNivale.]\r\n\r\nIf we would now pass in review the complete series of Zones of\r\nVegetation, it is to the north of Hindostan, in the Himalaya, or to\r\nSouth America and the Cordillera of the Andes, that we must transport\r\nourselves. On the first steps, or lowest terraces, of these immense\r\nchains, we shall see the tropical Flora revealing all its wealth and\r\nits puissance; there, between 3500 and 6900 feet above the sea-level,\r\nwe meet with nearly all the plants peculiar to temperate climes, and\r\nthose which only belong to the northern lands. On the Himalayan slopes,\r\nthe pine and the cedar flourish at an elevation of 7500 feet. Advancing\r\nfrom this limit, we soon encounter a great variety of Rhododendrons, a\r\nshrub now well known in our European gardens, and highly prized for its\r\never green foliage and rich full bloom. It thrives at the height of\r\n12,000 feet; a few species even battle with the elements at an altitude\r\nof 15,000 feet, but they are then only stunted and crawling plants. With\r\nthese are associated, at about 10,000 feet, the alder, the birch, and\r\nthe willow. The plains are covered, at the same time, with a prodigious\r\nhost of Ranunculaceæ, Compositæ, Saxifrages, and Pinnalaceæ, to which\r\nsucceeds all the army of Lichens. Thus, then, it appears that the same\r\nlaws determine always and everywhere the orographic distribution of\r\nplants. Only the influence of elevation is counterbalanced here by that\r\nof climate; whence it results that the arborescent species endure at a\r\nfar greater height than on our European mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner that the Himalaya \"resumes,\" so to speak, the Flora\r\nof all the climates of the Old World, does the Cordillera of the Andes,\r\nand, notably, that portion of the chain situated between Peru and\r\nVenezuela, present all the vegetable types of the New World, disposed\r\nupon its plateaux and its slopes as upon a gigantic flight of steps. In\r\nthe lower region, the plants of Tropical America, favoured by a marshy\r\nsoil, deck themselves out in their most gorgeous attire. At an elevation\r\nof between 1800 and 3500 feet, the vegetation is neither so brilliant\r\nnor so varied, but it has not yet thrown off its original character. We\r\nremark here a constant abundance of Myrtaceæ, Laurenaciæ, and\r\nBignoniaceæ, as well as numerous epiphytous plants--Orchidaceæ, Ferns,\r\nBromeliaceæ. From 3500 to 9000 feet we mark the successive appearance of\r\nplants belonging to the colder countries of North America: Escallionæ,\r\nMagnoliaceæ, Vacciniaceæ, and Solanaceæ. Here and there a few\r\nBromeliaceæ and some other epiphytes display themselves. We encounter\r\nalso in this zone a small number of Palmaceæ; among others, the\r\nCeroxylon and the Diplothenium. But soon the arborescent vegetation\r\nalmost wholly disappears, and only a few stunted bushes remain, similar\r\nto those which, in the Alps, succeed the larch. Then come meadows almost\r\nentirely formed of Compositæ, Umbelliferæ, and Saxifrages; and, finally,\r\nthe Lichens, the last plants-the last forms of vegetable life--lingering\r\non the frontiers of the region of eternal snow.\r\n\r\nIf the law which presides over the orographic distribution of plants\r\nwere applicable to the animal kingdom, we should meet on the frozen\r\ncrests of the mountains with the same species as, or, at least, with\r\nanalogous species to, those we have seen in the vicinity of the Pole.\r\nBut it is not so. Plants flourish wherever they can find, with an\r\nendurable climate, a soil in which their roots can develop themselves\r\nand imbibe the juices needful for their support; but the conditions\r\nwhich render a country inhabitable for animals--I mean the higher\r\nanimals more particularly--are wholly different and more complex. A\r\nfacility for removing from place to place in search of food is one of\r\nthese conditions, and assuredly one of the most essential. But the\r\nnumber of terrestrial animals capable of climbing the scarped flanks, of\r\ntraversing the narrow ridges, and leaping across the precipitous chasms\r\nof the mountains, is extremely limited. However, a few Herbivora excel\r\nin these perilous exercises. They are Ruminants of small size, with tiny\r\nlimbs, and small ungulated hoofs; Moufflons, wild Goats, Chamois, Kids,\r\nwhich seek on inaccessible heights a refuge against the attacks of man\r\nand the Carnaria, and bound, with marvellous agility and precision, from\r\nrock to rock, from icy crag to crag, over the most formidable gulfs, and\r\nup the most precipitous steeps.\r\n\r\nThe Moufflons, or Wild Sheep, erroneously regarded by some naturalists\r\nas the ancestors of our domestic sheep, form a genus whose species are\r\ndistributed in Asia, America, and Northern Africa, and in the\r\nmountainous islands of the Mediterranean. The Musmon Moufflon, which\r\ninhabits the mountains of Corsica, of Sardinia, of Cyprus, and of\r\nCandia, is nearly the size of a sheep, but far more robust. His hair,\r\nwhich is only wool properly so called, is a reddish-brown over nearly\r\nthe whole of his body, and whitish under the belly and the legs. His\r\nhorns are of great size, transversely crumpled, with a simple curve, and\r\na sharp extremity. Among the Asiatic species the largest is the _Masimon\r\nargali_, which inhabits the Altaï and the mountains of Kamtschatka, and\r\napproaches the ass in size. His skin is a yellowish-brown, with some\r\nwhite on the fore-feet. His horns describe an almost complete circle.\r\nThe American species is the _Musimon montanus_, which we find in the\r\nRocky Mountains. Finally, the region of the Atlas and of the Aurès\r\nMountains is the country of the Ruffled Moufflon (_Moufflon à\r\nManchettes_), so named on account of his long hairs, which fall from his\r\nshoulders upon the extremity of his anterior legs. His neck is also\r\nsupplied with a thick mane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSK-DEER.]\r\n\r\nThe Wild Goats and Bouquetins probably form, as the best authorities\r\nrepresent, but one and the same genus. In any case the latter are much\r\nbetter known than the former. They closely resemble our domestic goats,\r\nfrom which they chiefly differ in the prodigious development of their\r\nhorns, the said horns being generally knotty, slightly divergent, and\r\nsupported by osseous axes. Their name, according to Gervais, comes from\r\ntwo words, _Bouc-estain_, signifying the Goat of the Rocks. They belong\r\nexclusively to the Old Continent. These animals are very wild. The\r\nprecipitousness and lofty elevation of their pasture-grounds render\r\ntheir chase a matter of peril. The same may be said of the Chamois, or\r\nIsard, which inhabits the loftiest ridges of the Alps, the Pyrenees, and\r\nthe mountains of Greece. Dogs are of no avail in hunting these animals.\r\nIn Asia the falcon is employed in capturing the bouquetin. In Europe the\r\nchamois-hunters are excellent marksmen--indefatigable, fearless, capable\r\nof great endurance, keen, and vigilant. It is at morn and eve that they\r\nventure forth on their hazardous enterprise. The chamois wander in small\r\ntroops. Their voice is a kind of low bleating; but when one of them\r\ndescries approaching danger, he immediately raises a sharp cry, which is\r\nthe signal of flight. Driven together and closely packed, the poor\r\nanimals stand at bay, and dash themselves upon the daring hunter with an\r\nimpetuosity which often proves fatal to him.\r\n\r\nThe Musk-Deer form a distinct family in the order _Ruminantia_. In their\r\nexternal conformation they resemble both the stag and the antelope, but\r\nthey have neither horns nor antlers; their stomach is deficient in the\r\npart named the _feuillet_, which exists in all the other Ruminantia;\r\nfinally, their upper jaw is provided with two long canines, which among\r\nthe males project from the mouth, and which serve at one and the same\r\ntime as defensive arms and as instruments to dig out of the soil the\r\nroots upon which these animals feed. All the species of this genus are\r\nAsiatic, except one, which is a native of Guinea. I can only\r\nparticularize here the Musk-Deer of Thibet and Nepaul, which furnishes\r\ncommerce with the curious product, so useful in medicine and perfumery,\r\nknown as _musk_. This product is an extremely odorous and unctuous\r\nsubstance, contained in a special organ situated under the belly of the\r\nmale. The high price which it commands would make the chase of the\r\nmusk-deer very profitable, were not these animals so rare and so\r\ndifficult to get at. They lead a solitary life among the scarped rocks\r\nand in the thorny bushes bordering on the glaciers. In winter they\r\ndescend towards more temperate localities. They are caught either in\r\nsnares or with nooses, or slain with arrows. The Tongusian hunters, to\r\nattract the musk-deer, imitate the cry of their young by applying the\r\nmouth to a fragment of bark. The chase is only pursued in winter and\r\nautumn. In Thibet the hunters require a special license from the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWe may pass over the species of Rodents which burrow among the\r\nmountains, with a word of allusion to the traditional companion of the\r\npoor wandering Savoyard, the Alpine Marmot. This gentle and interesting\r\nanimal is so well known to my readers that I need not pause to describe\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the deep gorges and dense forests which break up the monotony of the\r\nlofty table-lands, live in fierce solitude the congeners of the \"Man in\r\nthe White Cloak\" of the Polar deserts--Bears with a thick fur and of a\r\nsombre hue. While these animals seem designed by their organization to\r\nfeed upon flesh, and while their strength enables them to seize upon the\r\nlargest game--which, indeed, they occasionally do--their diet is\r\nomnivorous, and they even exhibit, in general, a marked predilection for\r\nthe aliment of a vegetable nature. The reader, moreover, will remember\r\nwith what eagerness the bears of our menageries and zoological gardens\r\ndevour the bread, cakes, or fruit which their visitors press upon them.\r\nIn their native mountain homes they will rather fly from man than attack\r\nhim; but if assailed and closely pressed, they defend themselves\r\nbravely, rearing upon their hind-feet, and endeavouring to suffocate\r\ntheir aggressor with their muscular arms. If caught in their youth they\r\nare easily tamed, and display a greater intelligence than any of the\r\nother carnivora.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Ursidæ_, or Bears, is wholly wanting in Africa, but has its\r\nrepresentatives in Europe, Asia, and America. The European species are:\r\nthe great Brown Bear, formerly distributed over all the mountains and\r\nthrough all the forests of Western and Northern Europe, and which is\r\nstill sufficiently common in the Alps, the Pyrenees, and some wooded\r\nhighland districts of Russia; and the Bear of Asturias, found only in\r\nthe sierras of the Iberian peninsula. The latter is of smaller\r\ndimensions than the former. His hide is tawny.\r\n\r\nAsia possesses: the Syrian Bear and Bear of Lebanon, two varieties of\r\nthe same species, distinguished by Horsfield under the name of _Ursus\r\nisabella_, in allusion to the dirty brown colour of his skin; the Boar\r\nof Thibet, which is found in the Himalayan chain and the islands of\r\nJapan--in size and appearance he approximates to our European bear, but\r\ndiffers in the blacker shades of his hair; the Malay Bear (_Prochilus\r\nMalayanus_), which is jet black, climbs trees with agility, and lives on\r\na vegetable diet; and the Juggler, or Jungle Bear of India (_Prochilus\r\nursinus_), originally named the \"Five-fingered Sloth,\"--a great\r\nfavourite with the Indian jugglers on account of his adaptability and\r\nmildness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Black Bear of Canada. 2. Gray Bear of North America.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CONDOR OF THE ANDES.]\r\n\r\nTo North America belong the Black Bear (_Ursus Americanus_) and the\r\nGrisly Bear (_Ursus ferox_). The former has a long head, a pointed nose,\r\nsmall eyes, and short round ears; his limbs are strong, unwieldy, and\r\nthick; his tail is short; feet large; and the hair on the body smooth,\r\nglossy, and black. The Grisly Bear is about nine feet long, a narrow and\r\nflattened muzzle, sunken eyes, and formidable teeth; he ranges over not\r\nonly the entire chain of the Rocky Mountains, but in the prairies and\r\nforests which occupy the centre and west of the great continent, where\r\nhis sanguinary instincts and prodigious strength render him a formidable\r\nantagonist. The Black Bear of Canada, on the contrary, is the least\r\nferocious and least carnivorous of his genus. His chief food is of a\r\nvegetable nature--grain, fruits, and roots--but he does not disdain an\r\noccasional regale of pork. He commits great depredations on the\r\nmaize-fields, and is also exceedingly partial to honey. From the nature\r\nof his food, his flesh is exceedingly succulent, and much relished by\r\nthe Canadian settlers.\r\n\r\nAscend the wildest and most barren mountains, even to the limit where\r\nall life ceases to exist; or the flank of a perpendicular rock, in a\r\ncrevasse, in some chink or fissure where the foot of man or quadruped\r\nmay never rest; and there, were you able to approach sufficiently near,\r\nyou would see some interlaced branches and stems, and within it a few\r\nfragments, a few gnawed and polished bones, while a strong odour scented\r\nthe surrounding air. Regard it more attentively--some tiny creatures are\r\nastir upon that unclean couch. Yes: your gaze now rests on the eyry of\r\none of those aërial tyrants, Eagles or Vultures, which alone can dwell\r\non the cloud-crowned, wind-swept heights. I must confine myself here to\r\nmentioning the largest and most formidable species, which surpasses all\r\nthe others in sweep and speed and power of flight--the Condor of the\r\nAndes. This bird possesses the habits and voracity of other vultures,\r\nand, as if conscious of his enormous strength, shows himself the most\r\naudacious. He frequently pounces upon living animals; but his\r\nnon-retractile talons, blunted by their attrition upon the rocks, do not\r\npermit him to carry off his prey; he contents himself with fixing it\r\nagainst the ground with one of his claws, while he rends it to pieces\r\nwith his powerful beak. Gorged with food, he becomes incapable of\r\nflight. You may then approach him; but should you attempt to seize him,\r\nhe opposes a desperate resistance, and as he enjoys an extraordinary\r\ntenacity of life, the victory will probably cause you a prolonged\r\nstruggle and many cruel wounds.\r\n\r\nA story is told of a Chili miner, of more than ordinary physical force,\r\nwho attacked--hand-to-hand, as it were--a condor while digesting his\r\ngreedy banquet, and unable to make his escape. The engagement was long\r\nand desperate. The man was compelled to put forth all his strength. At\r\nlength, exhausted, torn, and bleeding, he left his enemy on the field of\r\nbattle, and carried off for a trophy a few feathers, which he showed to\r\nhis comrades, affirming that he had never fought a harder fight. The\r\nother miners went in search of the corpse of this terrible bird. They\r\nfound him standing erect, and flapping his wings in order to fly away.\r\nThey only killed him by crushing in his head with a hatchet.\r\n\r\nThe condor enjoys the privilege of an exceptional longevity. The Indians\r\nof the Andean plains assert that he lives nearly a hundred years. He\r\nbuilds no regular nest; the female is satisfied with a hollow in the\r\nrocky cliff of sufficient size to shelter her while hatching her eggs.\r\nBoth parents busy themselves very attentively in bringing up their\r\nyoung, disgorging in their beaks the food which they have themselves\r\ntaken. The young birds grow slowly; it is not until they are six weeks\r\nold that they begin to flutter round their parents. Their training,\r\nhowever, lasts but a few months; after which they separate of their own\r\naccord from the male and female birds, and seek their own nourishment.\r\n\r\nThe condor has the loftiest flight of all the winged race. He has been\r\nseen towering in the \"blue serene,\" on a level with the snow-crowned\r\nsummit of Illimani, 23,000 feet above the sea, in a region where man\r\ncannot endure the excessive rarefaction of the air. When, in the fulness\r\nof time, civilization shall have conquered to itself the South American\r\ncontinent, the condor, flying for refuge to these brain-wildering\r\nheights among the icy peaks of the Cordillera, shall be, perhaps, in\r\nthat quarter of the globe, the latest denizen of the Desert--the last\r\nrepresentative of THE SAVAGE WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbye-singh, the tiger-killer, 310.\r\n\r\nAbyssinia, its physical features, 248;\r\n  flora, 248-50;\r\n  mountains, 596.--See also SHOA, TIGRE.\r\n\r\nAbyssinian meadow-grass, 242.\r\n\r\n_Acacia detinens_, 257.\r\n\r\n_Acacia doratoxylon_, 279.\r\n\r\nAcacias, family of, their characteristics, 411.\r\n\r\n_Acrostichon grande_, 277.\r\n\r\n_Actæas_ described, 261.\r\n\r\n_Adansonia digitata_ (the Baobab), 409.\r\n\r\nAdour, the, valley of, 27.\r\n\r\nAfrica, interior of, described, 186, 187;\r\n  southern plateau, 187, 194, 195;\r\n  its general physical features, 187, 188;\r\n  Karroos of Southern Africa, 188, 191.--See CAPE COLONY,\r\n  CENTRAL AFRICA, EQUITORIAL AFRICA, KAFFRARIA,\r\n  KALIHARI, NATAL, SENEGAMBIA.\r\n\r\nAfrican elephant, characteristics of, 451.\r\n\r\nAgami, the, described, 354.\r\n\r\nAgouti, the, described, 342.\r\n\r\nAgua, the, described, 363.\r\n\r\nAhu, the, described, 65.\r\n\r\nAkhaf, the desert of, 106, 109.\r\n\r\nAlbert N'yanza, the, discovered by Sir S.
