The practical application of hydromechanics\r\nforms the province of hydraulics (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  _Historical._--The fundamental principles of hydrostatics were first\r\n  given by Archimedes in his work [Greek: Peri tôn ochoumenôn], or _De\r\n  iis quae vehuntur in humido_, about 250 B.C., and were afterwards\r\n  applied to experiments by Marino Ghetaldi (1566-1627) in his _Promotus\r\n  Archimedes_ (1603). Archimedes maintained that each particle of a\r\n  fluid mass, when in equilibrium, is equally pressed in every\r\n  direction; and he inquired into the conditions according to which a\r\n  solid body floating in a fluid should assume and preserve a position\r\n  of equilibrium.\r\n\r\n  In the Greek school at Alexandria, which flourished under the auspices\r\n  of the Ptolemies, the first attempts were made at the construction of\r\n  hydraulic machinery, and about 120 B.C. the fountain of compression,\r\n  the siphon, and the forcing-pump were invented by Ctesibius and Hero.\r\n  The siphon is a simple instrument; but the forcing-pump is a\r\n  complicated invention, which could scarcely have been expected in the\r\n  infancy of hydraulics. It was probably suggested to Ctesibius by the\r\n  _Egyptian Wheel_ or _Noria_, which was common at that time, and which\r\n  was a kind of chain pump, consisting of a number of earthen pots\r\n  carried round by a wheel. In some of these machines the pots have a\r\n  valve in the bottom which enables them to descend without much\r\n  resistance, and diminishes greatly the load upon the wheel; and, if we\r\n  suppose that this valve was introduced so early as the time of\r\n  Ctesibius, it is not difficult to perceive how such a machine might\r\n  have led to the invention of the forcing-pump.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding these inventions of the Alexandrian school, its\r\n  attention does not seem to have been directed to the motion of fluids;\r\n  and the first attempt to investigate this subject was made by Sextus\r\n  Julius Frontinus, inspector of the public fountains at Rome in the\r\n  reigns of Nerva and Trajan. In his work _De aquaeductibus urbis Romae\r\n  commentarius_, he considers the methods which were at that time\r\n  employed for ascertaining the quantity of water discharged from\r\n  ajutages, and the mode of distributing the waters of an aqueduct or a\r\n  fountain. He remarked that the flow of water from an orifice depends\r\n  not only on the magnitude of the orifice itself, but also on the\r\n  height of the water in the reservoir; and that a pipe employed to\r\n  carry off a portion of water from an aqueduct should, as circumstances\r\n  required, have a position more or less inclined to the original\r\n  direction of the current. But as he was unacquainted with the law of\r\n  the velocities of running water as depending upon the depth of the\r\n  orifice, the want of precision which appears in his results is not\r\n  surprising.\r\n\r\n  Benedetto Castelli (1577-1644), and Evangelista Torricelli\r\n  (1608-1647), two of the disciples of Galileo, applied the discoveries\r\n  of their master to the science of hydrodynamics. In 1628 Castelli\r\n  published a small work, _Della misura dell' acque correnti_, in which\r\n  he satisfactorily explained several phenomena in the motion of fluids\r\n  in rivers and canals; but he committed a great paralogism in supposing\r\n  the velocity of the water proportional to the depth of the orifice\r\n  below the surface of the vessel. Torricelli, observing that in a jet\r\n  where the water rushed through a small ajutage it rose to nearly the\r\n  same height with the reservoir from which it was supplied, imagined\r\n  that it ought to move with the same velocity as if it had fallen\r\n  through that height by the force of gravity, and hence he deduced the\r\n  proposition that the velocities of liquids are as the square root of\r\n  the head, apart from the resistance of the air and the friction of the\r\n  orifice. This theorem was published in 1643, at the end of his\r\n  treatise _De motu gravium projectorum_, and it was confirmed by the\r\n  experiments of Raffaello Magiotti on the quantities of water\r\n  discharged from different ajutages under different pressures (1648).\r\n\r\n  In the hands of Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) hydrostatics assumed the\r\n  dignity of a science, and in a treatise on the equilibrium of liquids\r\n  (_Sur l'équilibre des liqueurs_), found among his manuscripts after\r\n  his death and published in 1663, the laws of the equilibrium of\r\n  liquids were demonstrated in the most simple manner, and amply\r\n  confirmed by experiments.\r\n\r\n  The theorem of Torricelli was employed by many succeeding writers, but\r\n  particularly by Edmé Mariotte (1620-1684), whose _Traité du mouvement\r\n  des eaux_, published after his death in the year 1686, is founded on a\r\n  great variety of well-conducted experiments on the motion of fluids,\r\n  performed at Versailles and Chantilly. In the discussion of some\r\n  points he committed considerable mistakes. Others he treated very\r\n  superficially, and in none of his experiments apparently did he attend\r\n  to the diminution of efflux arising from the contraction of the liquid\r\n  vein, when the orifice is merely a perforation in a thin plate; but he\r\n  appears to have been the first who attempted to ascribe the\r\n  discrepancy between theory and experiment to the retardation of the\r\n  water's velocity through friction. His contemporary Domenico\r\n  Guglielmini (1655-1710), who was inspector of the rivers and canals at\r\n  Bologna, had ascribed this diminution of velocity in rivers to\r\n  transverse motions arising from inequalities in their bottom. But as\r\n  Mariotte observed similar obstructions even in glass pipes where no\r\n  transverse currents could exist, the cause assigned by Guglielmini\r\n  seemed destitute of foundation. The French philosopher, therefore,\r\n  regarded these obstructions as the effects of friction. He supposed\r\n  that the filaments of water which graze along the sides of the pipe\r\n  lose a portion of their velocity; that the contiguous filaments,\r\n  having on this account a greater velocity, rub upon the former, and\r\n  suffer a diminution of their celerity; and that the other filaments\r\n  are affected with similar retardations proportional to their distance\r\n  from the axis of the pipe. In this way the medium velocity of the\r\n  current may be diminished, and consequently the quantity of water\r\n  discharged in a given time must, from the effects of friction, be\r\n  considerably less than that which is computed from theory.\r\n\r\n  The effects of friction and viscosity in diminishing the velocity of\r\n  running water were noticed in the _Principia_ of Sir Isaac Newton, who\r\n  threw much light upon several branches of hydromechanics. At a time\r\n  when the Cartesian system of vortices universally prevailed, he found\r\n  it necessary to investigate that hypothesis, and in the course of his\r\n  investigations he showed that the velocity of any stratum of the\r\n  vortex is an arithmetical mean between the velocities of the strata\r\n  which enclose it; and from this it evidently follows that the velocity\r\n  of a filament of water moving in a pipe is an arithmetical mean\r\n  between the velocities of the filaments which surround it. Taking\r\n  advantage of these results, Henri Pitot (1695-1771) afterwards showed\r\n  that the retardations arising from friction are inversely as the\r\n  diameters of the pipes in which the fluid moves. The attention of\r\n  Newton was also directed to the discharge of water from orifices in\r\n  the bottom of vessels. He supposed a cylindrical vessel full of water\r\n  to be perforated in its bottom with a small hole by which the water\r\n  escaped, and the vessel to be supplied with water in such a manner\r\n  that it always remained full at the same height. He then supposed this\r\n  cylindrical column of water to be divided into two parts,--the first,\r\n  which he called the \"cataract,\" being an hyperboloid generated by the\r\n  revolution of an hyperbola of the fifth degree around the axis of the\r\n  cylinder which should pass through the orifice, and the second the\r\n  remainder of the water in the cylindrical vessel. He considered the\r\n  horizontal strata of this hyperboloid as always in motion, while the\r\n  remainder of the water was in a state of rest, and imagined that there\r\n  was a kind of cataract in the middle of the fluid. When the results of\r\n  this theory were compared with the quantity of water actually\r\n  discharged, Newton concluded that the velocity with which the water\r\n  issued from the orifice was equal to that which a falling body would\r\n  receive by descending through half the height of water in the\r\n  reservoir. This conclusion, however, is absolutely irreconcilable with\r\n  the known fact that jets of water rise nearly to the same height as\r\n  their reservoirs, and Newton seems to have been aware of this\r\n  objection. Accordingly, in the second edition of his _Principia_,\r\n  which appeared in 1713, he reconsidered his theory. He had discovered\r\n  a contraction in the vein of fluid (_vena contracta_) which issued\r\n  from the orifice, and found that, at the distance of about a diameter\r\n  of the aperture, the section of the vein was contracted in the\r\n  subduplicate ratio of two to one. He regarded, therefore, the section\r\n  of the contracted vein as the true orifice from which the discharge of\r\n  water ought to be deduced, and the velocity of the effluent water as\r\n  due to the whole height of water in the reservoir; and by this means\r\n  his theory became more conformable to the results of experience,\r\n  though still open to serious objections. Newton was also the first to\r\n  investigate the difficult subject of the motion of waves (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  In 1738 Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782) published his _Hydrodynamica seu\r\n  de viribus et motibus fluidorum commentarii_. His theory of the motion\r\n  of fluids, the germ of which was first published in his memoir\r\n  entitled _Theoria nova de motu aquarum per canales quocunque\r\n  fluentes_, communicated to the Academy of St Petersburg as early as\r\n  1726, was founded on two suppositions, which appeared to him\r\n  conformable to experience. He supposed that the surface of the fluid,\r\n  contained in a vessel which is emptying itself by an orifice, remains\r\n  always horizontal; and, if the fluid mass is conceived to be divided\r\n  into an infinite number of horizontal strata of the same bulk, that\r\n  these strata remain contiguous to each other, and that all their\r\n  points descend vertically, with velocities inversely proportional to\r\n  their breadth, or to the horizontal sections of the reservoir. In\r\n  order to determine the motion of each stratum, he employed the\r\n  principle of the _conservatio virium vivarum_, and obtained very\r\n  elegant solutions. But in the absence of a general demonstration of\r\n  that principle, his results did not command the confidence which they\r\n  would otherwise have deserved, and it became desirable to have a\r\n  theory more certain, and depending solely on the fundamental laws of\r\n  mechanics. Colin Maclaurin (1698-1746) and John Bernoulli (1667-1748),\r\n  who were of this opinion, resolved the problem by more direct methods,\r\n  the one in his _Fluxions_, published in 1742, and the other in his\r\n  _Hydraulica nunc primum detecta, et demonstrata directe ex fundamentis\r\n  pure mechanicis_, which forms the fourth volume of his works. The\r\n  method employed by Maclaurin has been thought not sufficiently\r\n  rigorous; and that of John Bernoulli is, in the opinion of Lagrange,\r\n  defective in clearness and precision. The theory of Daniel Bernoulli\r\n  was opposed also by Jean le Rond d'Alembert. When generalizing the\r\n  theory of pendulums of Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705) he discovered a\r\n  principle of dynamics so simple and general that it reduced the laws\r\n  of the motions of bodies to that of their equilibrium. He applied this\r\n  principle to the motion of fluids, and gave a specimen of its\r\n  application at the end of his _Dynamics_ in 1743. It was more fully\r\n  developed in his _Traité des fluides_, published in 1744, in which he\r\n  gave simple and elegant solutions of problems relating to the\r\n  equilibrium and motion of fluids. He made use of the same suppositions\r\n  as Daniel Bernoulli, though his calculus was established in a very\r\n  different manner. He considered, at every instant, the actual motion\r\n  of a stratum as composed of a motion which it had in the preceding\r\n  instant and of a motion which it had lost; and the laws of equilibrium\r\n  between the motions lost furnished him with equations representing the\r\n  motion of the fluid. It remained a desideratum to express by equations\r\n  the motion of a particle of the fluid in any assigned direction. These\r\n  equations were found by d'Alembert from two principles--that a\r\n  rectangular canal, taken in a mass of fluid in equilibrium, is itself\r\n  in equilibrium, and that a portion of the fluid, in passing from one\r\n  place to another, preserves the same volume when the fluid is\r\n  incompressible, or dilates itself according to a given law when the\r\n  fluid is elastic. His ingenious method, published in 1752, in his\r\n  _Essai sur la résistance des fluides_, was brought to perfection in\r\n  his _Opuscules mathématiques_, and was adopted by Leonhard Euler.\r\n\r\n  The resolution of the questions concerning the motion of fluids was\r\n  effected by means of Euler's partial differential coefficients. This\r\n  calculus was first applied to the motion of water by d'Alembert, and\r\n  enabled both him and Euler to represent the theory of fluids in\r\n  formulae restricted by no particular hypothesis.\r\n\r\n  One of the most successful labourers in the science of hydrodynamics\r\n  at this period was Pierre Louis Georges Dubuat (1734-1809). Following\r\n  in the steps of the Abbé Charles Bossut (_Nouvelles Experiences sur la\r\n  résistance des fluides_, 1777), he published, in 1786, a revised\r\n  edition of his _Principes d'hydraulique_, which contains a\r\n  satisfactory theory of the motion of fluids, founded solely upon\r\n  experiments. Dubuat considered that if water were a perfect fluid, and\r\n  the channels in which it flowed infinitely smooth, its motion would be\r\n  continually accelerated, like that of bodies descending in an inclined\r\n  plane. But as the motion of rivers is not continually accelerated, and\r\n  soon arrives at a state of uniformity, it is evident that the\r\n  viscosity of the water, and the friction of the channel in which it\r\n  descends, must equal the accelerating force. Dubuat, therefore,\r\n  assumed it as a proposition of fundamental importance that, when water\r\n  flows in any channel or bed, the accelerating force which obliges it\r\n  to move is equal to the sum of all the resistances which it meets\r\n  with, whether they arise from its own viscosity or from the friction\r\n  of its bed. This principle was employed by him in the first edition of\r\n  his work, which appeared in 1779. The theory contained in that edition\r\n  was founded on the experiments of others, but he soon saw that a\r\n  theory so new, and leading to results so different from the ordinary\r\n  theory, should be founded on new experiments more direct than the\r\n  former, and he was employed in the performance of these from 1780 to\r\n  1783. The experiments of Bossut were made only on pipes of a moderate\r\n  declivity, but Dubuat used declivities of every kind, and made his\r\n  experiments upon channels of various sizes.\r\n\r\n  The theory of running water was greatly advanced by the researches of\r\n  Gaspard Riche de Prony (1755-1839). From a collection of the best\r\n  experiments by previous workers he selected eighty-two (fifty-one on\r\n  the velocity of water in conduit pipes, and thirty-one on its velocity\r\n  in open canals); and, discussing these on physical and mechanical\r\n  principles, he succeeded in drawing up general formulae, which\r\n  afforded a simple expression for the velocity of running water.\r\n\r\n  J. A. Eytelwein (1764-1848) of Berlin, who published in 1801 a\r\n  valuable compendium of hydraulics entitled _Handbuch der Mechanik und\r\n  der Hydraulik_, investigated the subject of the discharge of water by\r\n  compound pipes, the motions of jets and their impulses against plane\r\n  and oblique surfaces; and he showed theoretically that a water-wheel\r\n  will have its maximum effect when its circumference moves with half\r\n  the velocity of the stream.\r\n\r\n  J. N. P. Hachette (1769-1834) in 1816-1817 published memoirs\r\n  containing the results of experiments on the spouting of fluids and\r\n  the discharge of vessels. His object was to measure the contracted\r\n  part of a fluid vein, to examine the phenomena attendant on additional\r\n  tubes, and to investigate the form of the fluid vein and the results\r\n  obtained when different forms of orifices are employed. Extensive\r\n  experiments on the discharge of water from orifices (_Expériences\r\n  hydrauliques_, Paris, 1832) were conducted under the direction of the\r\n  French government by J. V. Poncelet (1788-1867) and J. A. Lesbros\r\n  (1790-1860). P. P. Boileau (1811-1891) discussed their results and\r\n  added experiments of his own (_Traité de la mésure des eaux\r\n  courantes_, Paris, 1854). K. R. Bornemann re-examined all these\r\n  results with great care, and gave formulae expressing the variation of\r\n  the coefficients of discharge in different conditions (_Civil\r\n  Ingénieur_, 1880). Julius Weisbach (1806-1871) also made many\r\n  experimental investigations on the discharge of fluids. The\r\n  experiments of J. B. Francis (_Lowell Hydraulic Experiments_, Boston,\r\n  Mass., 1855) led him to propose variations in the accepted formulae\r\n  for the discharge over weirs, and a generation later a very complete\r\n  investigation of this subject was carried out by H. Bazin. An\r\n  elaborate inquiry on the flow of water in pipes and channels was\r\n  conducted by H. G. P. Darcy (1803-1858) and continued by H. Bazin, at\r\n  the expense of the French government (_Recherches hydrauliques_,\r\n  Paris, 1866). German engineers have also devoted special attention to\r\n  the measurement of the flow in rivers; the _Beiträge zur Hydrographie\r\n  des Königreiches Böhmen_ (Prague, 1872-1875) of A. R. Harlacher\r\n  (1842-1890) contained valuable measurements of this kind, together\r\n  with a comparison of the experimental results with the formulae of\r\n  flow that had been proposed up to the date of its publication, and\r\n  important data were yielded by the gaugings of the Mississippi made\r\n  for the United States government by A. A. Humphreys and H. L. Abbot,\r\n  by Robert Gordon's gaugings of the Irrawaddy, and by Allen J. C.\r\n  Cunningham's experiments on the Ganges canal. The friction of water,\r\n  investigated for slow speeds by Coulomb, was measured for higher\r\n  speeds by William Froude (1810-1879), whose work is of great value in\r\n  the theory of ship resistance (_Brit.

(X.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROSTATICS\r\n\r\nHydrostatics is a science which grew originally out of a number of\r\nisolated practical problems; but it satisfies the requirement of perfect\r\naccuracy in its application to phenomena, the largest and smallest, of\r\nthe behaviour of a fluid. At the same time, it delights the pure\r\ntheorist by the simplicity of the logic with which the fundamental\r\ntheorems may be established, and by the elegance of its mathematical\r\noperations, insomuch that hydrostatics may be considered as the\r\nEuclidean pure geometry of mechanical science.\r\n\r\n1. _The Different States of a Substance or Matter._--All substance in\r\nnature falls into one of the two classes, solid and fluid; a solid\r\nsubstance, the land, for instance, as contrasted with a fluid, like\r\nwater, being a substance which does not flow of itself.\r\n\r\nA _fluid_, as the name implies, is a substance which flows, or is\r\ncapable of flowing; water and air are the two fluids distributed most\r\nuniversally over the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nFluids again are divided into two classes, termed a liquid and a gas, of\r\nwhich water and air are the chief examples.\r\n\r\nA _liquid_ is a fluid which is incompressible or practically so, i.e. it\r\ndoes not change in volume sensibly with change of pressure.\r\n\r\nA _gas_ is a compressible fluid, and the change in volume is\r\nconsiderable with moderate variation of pressure.\r\n\r\nLiquids, again, can be poured from one open vessel into another, and can\r\nbe kept in an uncovered vessel, but a gas tends to diffuse itself\r\nindefinitely and must be preserved in a closed reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristics of the three kinds of substance or\r\nstates of matter, the solid, liquid and gas, are summarized thus in O.\r\nLodge's _Mechanics_:--\r\n\r\n  A solid has both size and shape.\r\n  A liquid has size but not shape.\r\n  A gas has neither size nor shape.\r\n\r\n2. _The Change of State of Matter._--By a change of temperature and\r\npressure combined, a substance can in general be made to pass from one\r\nstate into another; thus by gradually increasing the temperature a solid\r\npiece of ice can be melted into the liquid state of water, and the water\r\nagain can be boiled off into the gaseous state as steam. Again, by\r\nraising the temperature, a metal in the solid state can be melted and\r\nliquefied, and poured into a mould to assume any form desired, which is\r\nretained when the metal cools and solidifies again; the gaseous state of\r\na metal is revealed by the spectroscope. Conversely, a combination of\r\nincreased pressure and lowering of temperature will, if carried far\r\nenough, reduce a gas to a liquid, and afterwards to the solid state; and\r\nnearly every gaseous substance has now undergone this operation.\r\n\r\nA certain critical temperature is observed in a gas, above which the\r\nliquefaction is impossible; so that the gaseous state has two\r\nsubdivisions into (i.) a true gas, which cannot be liquefied, because\r\nits temperature is above the critical temperature, (ii.) a vapour, where\r\nthe temperature is below the critical, and which can ultimately be\r\nliquefied by further lowering of temperature or increase of pressure.\r\n\r\n3. _Plasticity and Viscosity._--Every solid substance is found to be\r\nplastic more or less, as exemplified by punching, shearing and cutting;\r\nbut the plastic solid is distinguished from the viscous fluid in that a\r\nplastic solid requires a certain magnitude of stress to be exceeded to\r\nmake it flow, whereas the viscous liquid will yield to the slightest\r\nstress, but requires a certain length of time for the effect to be\r\nappreciable.\r\n\r\nAccording to Maxwell (_Theory of Heat_) \"When a continuous alteration of\r\nform is produced only by a stress exceeding a certain value, the\r\nsubstance is called a solid, however soft and plastic it may be. But\r\nwhen the smallest stress, if only continued long enough, will cause a\r\nperceptible and increasing change of form, the substance must be\r\nregarded as a viscous fluid, however hard it may be.\" Maxwell\r\nillustrates the difference between a soft solid and a hard liquid by a\r\njelly and a block of pitch; also by the experiment of supporting a\r\ncandle and a stick of sealing-wax; after a considerable time the\r\nsealing-wax will be found bent and so is a fluid, but the candle remains\r\nstraight as a solid.\r\n\r\n4. _Definition of a Fluid._--A fluid is a substance which yields\r\ncontinually to the slightest tangential stress in its interior; that is,\r\nit can be divided very easily along any plane (given plenty of time if\r\nthe fluid is viscous). It follows that when the fluid has come to rest,\r\nthe tangential stress in any plane in its interior must vanish, and the\r\nstress must be entirely normal to the plane. This mechanical axiom of\r\nthe _normality of fluid pressure_ is the foundation of the mathematical\r\ntheory of hydrostatics.\r\n\r\nThe theorems of hydrostatics are thus true for all stationary fluids,\r\nhowever viscous they may be; it is only when we come to hydrodynamics,\r\nthe science of the motion of a fluid, that viscosity will make itself\r\nfelt and modify the theory; unless we begin by postulating the perfect\r\nfluid, devoid of viscosity, so that the principle of the _normality of\r\nfluid pressure_ is taken to hold when the fluid is in movement.\r\n\r\n  5. _The Measurement of Fluid Pressure._--The pressure at any point of\r\n  a plane in the interior of a fluid is the intensity of the normal\r\n  thrust estimated per unit area of the plane.\r\n\r\n  Thus, if a thrust of P lb. is distributed uniformly over a plane area\r\n  of A sq. ft., as on the horizontal bottom of the sea or any reservoir,\r\n  the pressure at any point of the plane is P/A lb. per sq. ft., or\r\n  P/144A lb. per sq. in. (lb./ft.² and lb./in.², in the Hospitalier\r\n  notation, to be employed in the sequel). If the distribution of the\r\n  thrust is not uniform, as, for instance, on a vertical or inclined\r\n  face or wall of a reservoir, then P/A represents the average pressure\r\n  over the area; and the actual pressure at any point is the average\r\n  pressure over a small area enclosing the point. Thus, if a thrust\r\n  [Delta]P lb. acts on a small plane area [Delta]A ft.² enclosing a\r\n  point B, the pressure p at B is the limit of [Delta]P/[Delta]A; and\r\n\r\n    p = lt([Delta]P/[Delta]A) = dP/dA,   (1)\r\n\r\n  in the notation of the differential calculus.\r\n\r\n  6. _The Equality of Fluid Pressure in all Directions._--This\r\n  fundamental principle of hydrostatics follows at once from the\r\n  principle of the normality of fluid pressure implied in the definition\r\n  of a fluid in § 4. Take any two arbitrary directions in the plane of\r\n  the paper, and draw a small isosceles triangle abc, whose sides are\r\n  perpendicular to the two directions, and consider the equilibrium of a\r\n  small triangular prism of fluid, of which the triangle is the cross\r\n  section. Let P, Q denote the normal thrust across the sides bc, ca,\r\n  and R the normal thrust across the base ab. Then, since these three\r\n  forces maintain equilibrium, and R makes equal angles with P and Q,\r\n  therefore P and Q must be equal. But the faces bc, ca, over which P\r\n  and Q act, are also equal, so that the pressure on each face is equal.\r\n  A scalene triangle abc might also be employed, or a tetrahedron.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1a.]\r\n\r\n  It follows that the pressure of a fluid requires to be calculated in\r\n  one direction only, chosen as the simplest direction for convenience.\r\n\r\n  7. _The Transmissibility of Fluid Pressure._--Any additional pressure\r\n  applied to the fluid will be transmitted equally to every point in the\r\n  case of a liquid; this principle of the _transmissibility of pressure_\r\n  was enunciated by Pascal, 1653, and applied by him to the invention of\r\n  the _hydraulic press_.\r\n\r\n  This machine consists essentially of two communicating cylinders (fig.\r\n  1a), filled with liquid and closed by pistons. If a thrust P lb. is\r\n  applied to one piston of area A ft.², it will be balanced by a thrust\r\n  W lb. applied to the other piston of area B ft.², where\r\n\r\n    p = P/A = W/B,   (1)\r\n\r\n  the pressure p of the liquid being supposed uniform; and, by making\r\n  the ratio B/A sufficiently large, the mechanical advantage can be\r\n  increased to any desired amount, and in the simplest manner possible,\r\n  without the intervention of levers and machinery.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1b shows also a modern form of the hydraulic press, applied to\r\n  the operation of covering an electric cable with a lead coating.\r\n\r\n  8. _Theorem._--In a fluid at rest under gravity the pressure is the\r\n  same at any two points in the same horizontal plane; in other words, a\r\n  surface of equal pressure is a horizontal plane.\r\n\r\n  This is proved by taking any two points A and B at the same level, and\r\n  considering the equilibrium of a thin prism of liquid AB, bounded by\r\n  planes at A and B perpendicular to AB. As gravity and the fluid\r\n  pressure on the sides of the prism act at right angles to AB, the\r\n  equilibrium requires the equality of thrust on the ends A and B; and\r\n  as the areas are equal, the pressure must be equal at A and B; and so\r\n  the pressure is the same at all points in the same horizontal plane.\r\n  If the fluid is a liquid, it can have a free surface without diffusing\r\n  itself, as a gas would; and this free surface, being a surface of zero\r\n  pressure, or more generally of uniform atmospheric pressure, will also\r\n  be a surface of equal pressure, and therefore a horizontal plane.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1b.]\r\n\r\n  Hence the _theorem_.--The free surface of a liquid at rest under\r\n  gravity is a horizontal plane. This is the characteristic\r\n  distinguishing between a solid and a liquid; as, for instance, between\r\n  land and water. The land has hills and valleys, but the surface of\r\n  water at rest is a horizontal plane; and if disturbed the surface\r\n  moves in waves.\r\n\r\n  9. _Theorem._--In a homogeneous liquid at rest under gravity the\r\n  pressure increases uniformly with the depth.\r\n\r\n  This is proved by taking the two points A and B in the same vertical\r\n  line, and considering the equilibrium of the prism by resolving\r\n  vertically. In this case the thrust at the lower end B must exceed the\r\n  thrust at A, the upper end, by the weight of the prism of liquid; so\r\n  that, denoting the cross section of the prism by [alpha] ft.², the\r\n  pressure at A and By by p0 and p lb./ft.², and by w the density of the\r\n  liquid estimated in lb./ft.³,\r\n\r\n    p[alpha] - p0[alpha] = w[alpha]·AB,   (1)\r\n\r\n    p = w·AB + p0.   (2)\r\n\r\n  Thus in water, where w = 62.4lb./ft.³, the pressure increases 62.4\r\n  lb./ft.², or 62.4 ÷ 144 = 0.433 lb./in.² for every additional foot of\r\n  depth.\r\n\r\n  10. _Theorem._--If two liquids of different density are resting in\r\n  vessels in communication, the height of the free surface of such\r\n  liquid above the surface of separation is inversely as the density.\r\n\r\n  For if the liquid of density [sigma] rises to the height h and of\r\n  density [rho] to the height k, and p0 denotes the atmospheric\r\n  pressure, the pressure in the liquid at the level of the surface of\r\n  separation will be [sigma]h + p0 and [rho]k + p0, and these being\r\n  equal we have\r\n\r\n    [sigma]h = [rho]k.   (1)\r\n\r\n  The principle is illustrated in the article BAROMETER, where a column\r\n  of mercury of density [sigma] and height h, rising in the tube to the\r\n  Torricellian vacuum, is balanced by a column of air of density [rho],\r\n  which may be supposed to rise as a homogeneous fluid to a height k,\r\n  called the height of the homogeneous atmosphere. Thus water being\r\n  about 800 times denser than air and mercury 13.6 times denser than\r\n  water,\r\n\r\n    k/h = [sigma]/[rho] = 800 × 13.6 = 10,880;   (2)\r\n\r\n  and with an average barometer height of 30 in. this makes k 27,200\r\n  ft., about 8300 metres.\r\n\r\n  11. _The Head of Water or a Liquid._--The pressure [sigma]h at a depth\r\n  h ft. in liquid of density [sigma] is called the pressure due to a\r\n  _head_ of h ft. of the liquid. The atmospheric pressure is thus due to\r\n  an average head of 30 in. of mercury, or 30 × 13.6 ÷ 12 = 34 ft. of\r\n  water, or 27,200 ft. of air. The pressure of the air is a convenient\r\n  unit to employ in practical work, where it is called an \"atmosphere\";\r\n  it is made the equivalent of a pressure of one kg/cm²; and one\r\n  ton/inch², employed as the unit with high pressure as in artillery,\r\n  may be taken as 150 atmospheres.\r\n\r\n  12. _Theorem._--A body immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force\r\n  equal to the weight of the liquid displaced, acting vertically upward\r\n  through the centre of gravity of the displaced liquid.\r\n\r\n  For if the body is removed, and replaced by the fluid as at first,\r\n  this fluid is in equilibrium under its own weight and the thrust of\r\n  the surrounding fluid, which must be equal and opposite, and the\r\n  surrounding fluid acts in the same manner when the body replaces the\r\n  displaced fluid again; so that the resultant thrust of the fluid acts\r\n  vertically upward through the centre of gravity of the fluid\r\n  displaced, and is equal to the weight.\r\n\r\n  When the body is floating freely like a ship, the equilibrium of this\r\n  liquid thrust with the weight of the ship requires that the weight of\r\n  water displaced is equal to the weight of the ship and the two centres\r\n  of gravity are in the same vertical line. So also a balloon begins to\r\n  rise when the weight of air displaced is greater than the weight of\r\n  the balloon, and it is in equilibrium when the weights are equal. This\r\n  theorem is called generally the _principle of Archimedes_.\r\n\r\n  It is used to determine the density of a body experimentally; for if W\r\n  is the weight of a body weighed in a balance in air (strictly _in\r\n  vacuo_), and if W´ is the weight required to balance when the body is\r\n  suspended in water, then the upward thrust of the liquid or weight of\r\n  liquid displaced is W - W´, so that the _specific gravity_ (S.G.),\r\n  defined as the ratio of the weight of a body to the weight of an equal\r\n  volume of water, is W/(W - W´).\r\n\r\n  As stated first by Archimedes, the principle asserts the obvious fact\r\n  that a body displaces its own volume of water; and he utilized it in\r\n  the problem of the determination of the adulteration of the crown of\r\n  Hiero. He weighed out a lump of gold and of silver of the same weight\r\n  as the crown; and, immersing the three in succession in water, he\r\n  found they spilt over measures of water in the ratio 1/14 : 4/77 :\r\n  2/21 or 33 : 24 : 44; thence it follows that the gold : silver alloy\r\n  of the crown was as 11 : 9 by weight.\r\n\r\n  13. _Theorem._--The resultant vertical thrust on any portion of a\r\n  curved surface exposed to the pressure of a fluid at rest under\r\n  gravity is the weight of fluid cut out by vertical lines drawn round\r\n  the boundary of the curved surface.\r\n\r\n  _Theorem._--The resultant horizontal thrust in any direction is\r\n  obtained by drawing parallel horizontal lines round the boundary, and\r\n  intersecting a plane perpendicular to their direction in a plane\r\n  curve; and then investigating the thrust on this plane area, which\r\n  will be the same as on the curved surface.\r\n\r\n  The proof of these theorems proceeds as before, employing the\r\n  normality principle; they are required, for instance, in the\r\n  determination of the liquid thrust on any portion of the bottom of a\r\n  ship.\r\n\r\n  In casting a thin hollow object like a bell, it will be seen that the\r\n  resultant upward thrust on the mould may be many times greater than\r\n  the weight of metal; many a curious experiment has been devised to\r\n  illustrate this property and classed as a hydrostatic paradox (Boyle,\r\n  _Hydrostatical Paradoxes_, 1666).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n  Consider, for instance, the operation of casting a hemispherical bell,\r\n  in fig. 2. As the molten metal is run in, the upward thrust on the\r\n  outside mould, when the level has reached PP´, is the weight of metal\r\n  in the volume generated by the revolution of APQ; and this, by a\r\n  theorem of Archimedes, has the same volume as the cone ORR´, or 1/3\r\n  [pi]y³, where y is the depth of metal, the horizontal sections being\r\n  equal so long as y is less than the radius of the outside hemisphere.\r\n  Afterwards, when the metal has risen above B, to the level KK´, the\r\n  additional thrust is the weight of the cylinder of diameter KK´ and\r\n  height BH. The upward thrust is the same, however thin the metal may\r\n  be in the interspace between the outer mould and the core inside; and\r\n  this was formerly considered paradoxical.\r\n\r\n  _Analytical Equations of Equilibrium of a Fluid at rest under any\r\n  System of Force._\r\n\r\n  14. Referred to three fixed coordinate axes, a fluid, in which the\r\n  pressure is p, the density [rho], and X, Y, Z the components of\r\n  impressed force per unit mass, requires for the equilibrium of the\r\n  part filling a fixed surface S, on resolving parallel to Ox,\r\n      _  _         _  _  _\r\n     /  /         /  /  /\r\n     |  | lp dS = |  |  | [rho]X dx dy dz,   (1)\r\n    _/ _/        _/ _/ _/\r\n\r\n  where l, m, n denote the direction cosines of the normal drawn outward\r\n  of the surface S.\r\n\r\n  But by Green's transformation\r\n      _  _         _  _  _\r\n     /  /         /  /  / dp\r\n     |  | lp dS = |  |  | -- dx dy dz,   (2)\r\n    _/ _/        _/ _/ _/ dx\r\n\r\n  thus leading to the differential relation at every point\r\n\r\n    dp           dp           dp\r\n    -- = [rho]X, -- = [rho]Y, -- = [rho]Z.   (3)\r\n    dx           dy           dz\r\n\r\n  The three equations of equilibrium obtained by taking moments round\r\n  the axes are then found to be satisfied identically.\r\n\r\n  Hence the space variation of the pressure in any direction, or the\r\n  _pressure-gradient_, is the resolved force per unit volume in that\r\n  direction. The resultant force is therefore in the direction of the\r\n  steepest pressure-gradient, and this is normal to the surface of equal\r\n  pressure; for equilibrium to exist in a fluid the lines of force must\r\n  therefore be capable of being cut orthogonally by a system of\r\n  surfaces, which will be surfaces of equal pressure.\r\n\r\n  Ignoring temperature effect, and taking the density as a function of\r\n  the pressure, surfaces of equal pressure are also of equal density,\r\n  and the fluid is stratified by surfaces orthogonal to the lines of\r\n  force;\r\n\r\n      1   dp    1   dp    1   dp\r\n    ----- --, ----- --, ----- --, or X, Y, Z   (4)\r\n    [rho] dx  [rho] dy  [rho] dz\r\n\r\n  are the partial differential coefficients of some function P, =\r\n  [int]dp/[rho], of x, y, z; so that X, Y, Z must be the partial\r\n  differential coefficients of a potential -V, such that the force in\r\n  any direction is the downward gradient of V; and then\r\n\r\n    dP   dV\r\n    -- + -- = 0, or P + V = constant,   (5)\r\n    dx   dx\r\n\r\n  in which P may be called the hydrostatic head and V the head of\r\n  potential.\r\n\r\n  With variation of temperature, the surfaces of equal pressure and\r\n  density need not coincide; but, taking the pressure, density and\r\n  temperature as connected by some relation, such as the gas-equation,\r\n  the surfaces of equal density and temperature must intersect in lines\r\n  lying on a surface of equal pressure.\r\n\r\n  15. As an example of the general equations, take the simplest case of\r\n  a uniform field of gravity, with Oz directed vertically downward;\r\n  employing the gravitation unit of force,\r\n\r\n      1   dp        1   dp        1   dp\r\n    ----- -- = 0, ----- -- = 0, ----- -- = 1,  (1)\r\n    [rho] dx      [rho] dy      [rho] dz\r\n         _\r\n        /\r\n    P = | dp/[rho] = z + a constant.

(17)\r\n\r\n  For sea water, [lambda] is about 25,000 atmospheres, and k is then\r\n  25,000 times the height of the water barometer, about 250,000 metres,\r\n  so that in an ocean 10 kilometres deep the level is lowered about 200\r\n  metres by the compressibility of the water; and the density at the\r\n  bottom is increased 4%.\r\n\r\n  On another physical assumption of constant cubical elasticity\r\n  [lambda],\r\n\r\n    dp = [lambda]d[rho]/[rho], (p - p0)/[lambda] = log([rho]/[rho]0), (18)\r\n\r\n    dp   [lambda]  d[rho]                   /  1        1  \\           [rho]0    z\r\n    -- = --------  ------ = [rho], [lambda]( ------ - ----- ) = z, 1 - ------ = ---, [lambda] = k[rho]0,  (19)\r\n    zd    [rho]      dz                     \\[rho]0   [rho]/            [rho]    k\r\n\r\n  and the lowering of the surface is\r\n\r\n    p - p0             [rho]               /     z \\                z²\r\n    ------ - z = k log ------ - z = k log ( 1 - --- ) - z [approx] ---  (20)\r\n    [rho]0             [rho]0              \\     k /                2k\r\n\r\n  as before in (17).\r\n\r\n  16. _Centre of Pressure._--A plane area exposed to fluid pressure on\r\n  one side experiences a single resultant thrust, the integrated\r\n  pressure over the area, acting through a definite point called the\r\n  centre of pressure (C.P.) of the area.\r\n\r\n  Thus if the plane is normal to Oz, the resultant thrust\r\n         _ _\r\n        / /\r\n    R = | |pdxdy,   (1)\r\n       _/_/\r\n\r\n  and the coordinates [=x], [=y] of the C.P. are given by\r\n             _ _                   _ _\r\n            / /                   / /\r\n    [=x]R = | | xp dx dy, [=y]R = | | yp dx dy.

Thus the core of a circle or an\r\n  ellipse is a concentric circle or ellipse of one quarter the size.\r\n\r\n  The C.P. of water lines passing through a fixed point lies on a\r\n  straight line, the antipolar of the point; and thus the core of a\r\n  triangle is a similar triangle of one quarter the size, and the core\r\n  of a parallelogram is another parallelogram, the diagonals of which\r\n  are the middle third of the median lines.\r\n\r\n  In the design of a structure such as a tall reservoir dam it is\r\n  important that the line of thrust in the material should pass inside\r\n  the core of a section, so that the material should not be in a state\r\n  of tension anywhere and so liable to open and admit the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n17. _Equilibrium and Stability of a Ship or Floating Body. The\r\nMetacentre._--The principle of Archimedes in § 12 leads immediately to\r\nthe conditions of equilibrium of a body supported freely in fluid, like\r\na fish in water or a balloon in the air, or like a ship (fig. 3)\r\nfloating partly immersed in water and the rest in air. The body is in\r\nequilibrium under two forces:--(i.) its weight W acting vertically\r\ndownward through G, the C.G. of the body, and (ii.) the buoyancy of the\r\nfluid, equal to the weight of the displaced fluid, and acting vertically\r\nupward through B, the C.G. of the displaced fluid; for equilibrium these\r\ntwo forces must be equal and opposite in the same line.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of equilibrium of a body, floating like a ship on the\r\nsurface of a liquid, are therefore:--\r\n\r\n(i.) the weight of the body must be less than the weight of the total\r\nvolume of liquid it can displace; or else the body will sink to the\r\nbottom of the liquid; the difference of the weights is called the\r\n\"reserve of buoyancy.\"\r\n\r\n(ii.) the weight of liquid which the body displaces in the position of\r\nequilibrium is equal to the weight W of the body; and\r\n\r\n(iii.) the C.G., B, of the liquid displaced and G of the body, must lie\r\nin the same vertical line GB.\r\n\r\n18. In addition to satisfying these conditions of equilibrium, a ship\r\nmust fulfil the further condition of stability, so as to keep upright;\r\nif displaced slightly from this position, the forces called into play\r\nmust be such as to restore the ship to the upright again. The stability\r\nof a ship is investigated practically by inclining it; a weight is moved\r\nacross the deck and the angle is observed of the heel produced.\r\n\r\n  Suppose P tons is moved c ft. across the deck of a ship of W tons\r\n  displacement; the C.G. will move from G to G1 the reduced distance\r\n  G1G2 = c(P/W); and if B, called the centre of buoyancy, moves to B1,\r\n  along the curve of buoyancy BB1, the normal of this curve at B1 will\r\n  be the new vertical B1G1, meeting the old vertical in a point M, the\r\n  centre of curvature of BB1, called the _metacentre_.\r\n\r\n  If the ship heels through an angle [theta] or a slope of 1 in m,\r\n\r\n    GM = GG1cot[theta] = mc(P/W),   (1)\r\n\r\n  and GM is called the metacentric height; and the ship must be\r\n  ballasted, so that G lies below M. If G was above M, the tangent drawn\r\n  from G to the evolute of B, and normal to the curve of buoyancy, would\r\n  give the vertical in a new position of equilibrium. Thus in H.M.S.\r\n  \"Achilles\" of 9000 tons displacement it was found that moving 20 tons\r\n  across the deck, a distance of 42 ft., caused the bob of a pendulum 20\r\n  ft. long to move through 10 in., so that\r\n\r\n         240         20\r\n    GM = --- × 42 × ---- = 2.24 ft.;   (2)\r\n          10        9000\r\n\r\n  also\r\n\r\n    cot [theta] = 24, [theta] = 2°24´.   (3)\r\n\r\n  In a diagram it is conducive to clearness to draw the ship in one\r\n  position, and to incline the water-line; and the page can be turned if\r\n  it is desired to bring the new water-line horizontal.\r\n\r\n  Suppose the ship turns about an axis through F in the water-line area,\r\n  perpendicular to the plane of the paper; denoting by y the distance of\r\n  an element dA if the water-line area from the axis of rotation, the\r\n  change of displacement is [sum]ydA tan[theta], so that there is no\r\n  change of displacement if [sum]ydA = 0, that is, if the axis passes\r\n  through the C.G. of the water-line area, which we denote by F and call\r\n  the centre of flotation.\r\n\r\n  The righting couple of the wedges of immersion and emersion will be\r\n\r\n    [Sigma]wy dA tan [theta]·y = w tan [theta] [Sigma] y² dA\r\n      = w tan [theta]·Ak² ft. tons,   (4)\r\n\r\n  w denoting the density of water in tons/ft.³, and W = wV, for a\r\n  displacement of V ft.³\r\n\r\n  This couple, combined with the original buoyancy W through B, is\r\n  equivalent to the new buoyancy through B, so that\r\n\r\n    W.BB1 = wAk² tan [theta],   (5)\r\n\r\n    BM = BB1 cot [theta] = Ak²/V,   (6)\r\n\r\n  giving the radius of curvature BM of the curve of buoyancy B, in terms\r\n  of the displacement V, and Ak² the moment of inertia of the water-line\r\n  area about an axis through F, perpendicular to the plane of\r\n  displacement.\r\n\r\n  An inclining couple due to moving a weight about in a ship will heel\r\n  the ship about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the couple, only\r\n  when this axis is a principal axis at F of the momental ellipse of the\r\n  water-line area A. For if the ship turns through a small angle [theta]\r\n  about the line FF´, then b1, b2, the C·G. of the wedge of immersion\r\n  and emersion, will be the C·P. with respect to FF´ of the two parts of\r\n  the water-line area, so that b1b2 will be conjugate to FF´ with\r\n  respect to the momental ellipse at F.\r\n\r\n  The naval architect distinguishes between the _stability of form_,\r\n  represented by the righting couple W.BM, and the _stability of\r\n  ballasting_, represented by W.BG. Ballasted with G at B, the righting\r\n  couple when the ship is heeled through [theta] is given by W.BM.\r\n  tan[theta]; but if weights inside the ship are raised to bring G above\r\n  B, the righting couple is diminished by W.BG.tan[theta], so that the\r\n  resultant righting couple is W·GM·tan[theta]. Provided the ship is\r\n  designed to float upright at the smallest draft with no load on board,\r\n  the stability at any other draft of water can be arranged by the\r\n  stowage of the weight, high or low.\r\n\r\n  19. Proceeding as in § 16 for the determination of the C.P. of an\r\n  area, the same argument will show that an inclining couple due to the\r\n  movement of a weight P through a distance c will cause the ship to\r\n  heel through an angle [theta] about an axis FF´ through F, which is\r\n  conjugate to the direction of the movement of P with respect to an\r\n  ellipse, not the momental ellipse of the water-line area A, but a\r\n  confocal to it, of squared semi-axes\r\n\r\n    a² - hV/A, b² - hV/A,   (1)\r\n\r\n  h denoting the vertical height BG between C.G. and centre of buoyancy.\r\n  The varying direction of the inclining couple Pc may be realized by\r\n  swinging the weight P from a crane on the ship, in a circle of radius\r\n  c. But if the weight P was lowered on the ship from a crane on shore,\r\n  the vessel would sink bodily a distance P/wA if P was deposited over\r\n  F; but deposited anywhere else, say over Q on the water-line area, the\r\n  ship would turn about a line the antipolar of Q with respect to the\r\n  confocal ellipse, parallel to FF´, at a distance FK from F\r\n\r\n    FK = (k² - hV/A)/FQ sin QFF´   (2)\r\n\r\n  through an angle [theta] or a slope of one in m, given by\r\n\r\n                   1      P      P        V\r\n    sin [theta] = --- = ----- = --- · -------- FQ sin QFF´,   (3)\r\n                   m    wA·FK    W    Ak² - hV\r\n\r\n  where k denotes the radius of gyration about FF´ of the water-line\r\n  area. Burning the coal on a voyage has the reverse effect on a\r\n  steamer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRODYNAMICS\r\n\r\n20. In considering the motion of a fluid we shall suppose it\r\nnon-viscous, so that whatever the state of motion the stress across any\r\nsection is normal, and the principle of the normality and thence of the\r\nequality of fluid pressure can be employed, as in hydrostatics. The\r\npractical problems of fluid motion, which are amenable to mathematical\r\nanalysis when viscosity is taken into account, are excluded from\r\ntreatment here, as constituting a separate branch called \"hydraulics\"\r\n(q.v.). Two methods are employed in hydrodynamics, called the Eulerian\r\nand Lagrangian, although both are due originally to Leonhard Euler. In\r\nthe Eulerian method the attention is fixed on a particular point of\r\nspace, and the change is observed there of pressure, density and\r\nvelocity, which takes place during the motion; but in the Lagrangian\r\nmethod we follow up a particle of fluid and observe how it changes. The\r\nfirst may be called the statistical method, and the second the\r\nhistorical, according to J. C. Maxwell. The Lagrangian method being\r\nemployed rarely, we shall confine ourselves to the Eulerian treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Eulerian Form of the Equations of Motion._\r\n\r\n21. The first equation to be established is the _equation of\r\ncontinuity_, which expresses the fact that the increase of matter within\r\na fixed surface is due to the flow of fluid across the surface into its\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\n  In a straight uniform current of fluid of density [rho], flowing with\r\n  velocity q, the flow in units of mass per second across a plane area\r\n  A, placed in the current with the normal of the plane making an angle\r\n  [theta] with the velocity, is [rho]Aq cos [theta], the product of the\r\n  density [rho], the area A, and q cos [theta] the component velocity\r\n  normal to the plane.\r\n\r\n  Generally if S denotes any closed surface, fixed in the fluid, M the\r\n  mass of the fluid inside it at any time t, and [theta] the angle which\r\n  the outward-drawn normal makes with the velocity q at that point,\r\n\r\n    dM/dt = rate of increase of fluid inside the surface,   (1)\r\n\r\n          = flux across the surface into the interior\r\n               _ _\r\n              / /\r\n          = - | | [rho]q cos [theta] dS,\r\n             _/_/\r\n\r\n  the integral equation of continuity.\r\n\r\n  In the Eulerian notation u, v, w denote the components of the velocity\r\n  q parallel to the coordinate axes at any point (x, y, z) at the time\r\n  t; u, v, w are functions of x, y, z, t, the independent variables; and\r\n  d is used here to denote partial differentiation with respect to any\r\n  one of these four independent variables, all capable of varying one at\r\n  a time.\r\n\r\n  To transfer the integral equation into the differential equation of\r\n  continuity, Green's transformation is required again, namely,\r\n      _ _ _                                         _ _\r\n     / / /  /d[xi]   d[eta]   d[zeta] \\            / /\r\n     | | | ( ----- + ------ + -------  )dx dy dz = | | (l[xi] + m[eta] + n[zeta]) dS,   (2)\r\n    _/_/_/  \\  dx      dy        dz   /           _/_/\r\n\r\n  or individually\r\n      _ _ _                   _ _\r\n     / / /  d[xi]            / /\r\n     | | |  ----- dx dy dz = | | l[xi] dS,...,   (3)\r\n    _/_/_/   dx             _/_/\r\n\r\n  where the integrations extend throughout the volume and over the\r\n  surface of a closed space S; l, m, n denoting the direction cosines of\r\n  the outward-drawn normal at the surface element dS, and [xi], [eta],\r\n  [zeta] any continuous functions of x, y, z.\r\n\r\n  The integral equation of continuity (1) may now be written\r\n      _ _ _                   _ _\r\n     / / /  d[rho]           / /\r\n     | | |  ----- dx dy dz = | | (l[rho]u + m[rho]v + n[rho]w) dS = 0,   (4)\r\n    _/_/_/    dt            _/_/\r\n\r\n  which becomes by Green's transformation\r\n    _ _ _\r\n   / / /  /d[rho]   d([rho]u)   d([rho]v)   d([rho]w)\\\r\n   | | | ( ------ + --------- + --------- + --------  ) dx dy dz = 0,   (5)\r\n  _/_/_/  \\  dt        dx          dy          dz    /\r\n\r\n  leading to the differential equation of continuity when the\r\n  integration is removed.\r\n\r\n22. The equations of motion can be established in a similar way by\r\nconsidering the rate of increase of momentum in a fixed direction of the\r\nfluid inside the surface, and equating it to the momentum generated by\r\nthe force acting throughout the space S, and by the pressure acting over\r\nthe surface S.\r\n\r\n  Taking the fixed direction parallel to the axis of x, the time-rate of\r\n  increase of momentum, due to the fluid which crosses the surface, is\r\n       _ _                            _ _\r\n      / /                            / /\r\n    - | | [rho]uq cos [theta] dS = - | | (l[rho]u² + m[rho]uv + n[rho]uw) dS,  (1)\r\n     _/_/                           _/_/\r\n\r\n  which by Green's transformation is\r\n       _ _ _\r\n      / / /  /d([rho]u²)   d([rho]uv)   d([rho]uw)\\\r\n    - | | | (---------- + ---------- + ----------  ) dx dy dz.

As a rule these equations are established immediately by determining\r\nthe component acceleration of the fluid particle which is passing\r\nthrough (x, y, z) at the instant t of time considered, and saying that\r\nthe reversed acceleration or kinetic reaction, combined with the\r\nimpressed force per unit of mass and pressure-gradient, will according\r\nto d'Alembert's principle form a system in equilibrium.\r\n\r\n  To determine the component acceleration of a particle, suppose F to\r\n  denote any function of x, y, z, t, and investigate the time rate of F\r\n  for a moving particle; denoting the change by DF/dt,\r\n\r\n    DF      F(x + u[delta]t, y + v[delta]t, z + w[delta]t, t + [delta]t) - F(x, y, z, t)\r\n    -- = lt·----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    dt                                       [delta]t\r\n\r\n      dF    dF    dF    dF\r\n    = -- + u-- + v-- + w--;   (1)\r\n      dt    dx    dy    dz\r\n\r\n  and D/dt is called particle differentiation, because it follows the\r\n  rate of change of a particle as it leaves the point x, y, z; but\r\n\r\n    dF/dt, dF/dx, dF/dy, dF/dz   (2)\r\n\r\n  represent the rate of change of F at the time t, at the point, x, y,\r\n  z, fixed in space.\r\n\r\n  The components of acceleration of a particle of fluid are consequently\r\n\r\n    Du   du    du    du    du\r\n    -- = -- + u-- + v-- + w--,   (3)\r\n    dt   dt    dx    dy    dz\r\n\r\n    Dv   dv    dv    dv    dv\r\n    -- = -- + u-- + v-- + w--,  (4)\r\n    dt   dt    dx    dy    dz\r\n\r\n    Dw   dw    dw    dw    dw\r\n    -- = -- + u-- + v-- + w--,  (5)\r\n    dt   dt    dx    dy    dz\r\n\r\n  leading to the equations of motion above.\r\n\r\n  If F (x, y, z, t) = 0 represents the equation of a surface containing\r\n  always the same particles of fluid,\r\n\r\n    DF         dF    dF    dF    dF\r\n    -- = 0, or -- + u-- + v-- + w-- = 0,   (6)\r\n    dt         dt    dx    dy    dz\r\n\r\n  which is called the differential equation of the _bounding surface_. A\r\n  bounding surface is such that there is no flow of fluid across it, as\r\n  expressed by equation (6). The surface always contains the same fluid\r\n  inside it, and condition (6) is satisfied over the complete surface,\r\n  as well as any part of it.\r\n\r\n  But turbulence in the motion will vitiate the principle that a\r\n  bounding surface will always consist of the same fluid particles, as\r\n  we see on the surface of turbulent water.\r\n\r\n  24. To integrate the equations of motion, suppose the impressed force\r\n  is due to a potential V, such that the force in any direction is the\r\n  rate of diminution of V, or its downward gradient; and then\r\n\r\n    X = -dV/dx, Y = -dV/dy, Z = -dV/dz;   (1)\r\n\r\n  and putting\r\n\r\n    dw   dv          du   dw           dv   du\r\n    -- - -- = 2[xi], -- - -- = 2[eta], -- - -- = 2[zeta],   (2)\r\n    dy   dz          dz   dx           dx   dy\r\n\r\n    d[xi]   d[eta]   d[zeta]\r\n    ----- + ------ + ------- = 0,   (3)\r\n     dx       dy       dz\r\n\r\n  the equations of motion may be written\r\n\r\n    du                        dH\r\n    -- - 2v[zeta] + 2w[eta] + -- = 0,   (4)\r\n    dt                        dx\r\n\r\n    dv                       dH\r\n    -- - 2w[xi] + 2u[zeta] + -- = 0,   (5)\r\n    dt                       dy\r\n\r\n    dw                      dH\r\n    -- - 2u[eta] + 2w[xi] + -- = 0,   (6)\r\n    dt                      dz\r\n\r\n  where\r\n         _\r\n        /\r\n    H = | dp/[rho] + V + ½q²,   (7)\r\n       _/\r\n\r\n    q² = u² + v² + w²,   (8)\r\n\r\n  and the three terms in H may be called the pressure head, potential\r\n  head, and head of velocity, when the gravitation unit is employed and\r\n  ½q² is replaced by ½q²/g.\r\n\r\n  Eliminating H between (5) and (6)\r\n\r\n    D[xi]       du        dv         dw        / du   dv   dw \\\r\n    ----- - [xi]-- - [eta]-- - [zeta]-- + [xi](  -- + -- + --  ) = 0,   (9)\r\n     dt         dx        dx         dx        \\ dx   dy   dz /\r\n\r\n  and combining this with the equation of continuity\r\n\r\n      1   D[rho]   du   dv   dw\r\n    ----- ------ + -- + -- + -- = 0,   (10)\r\n    [rho]   dt     dx   dy   dz\r\n\r\n  we have\r\n\r\n     D  /[xi] \\    [xi]  du   [eta] dv   [zeta] dw\r\n    -- ( ----- ) - ----- -- - ----- -- - ------ -- = 0,   (11)\r\n    dt  \\[rho]/    [rho] dx   [rho] dx   [rho]  dx\r\n\r\n  with two similar equations.\r\n\r\n  Putting\r\n\r\n    [omega]² = [xi]² + [eta]² + [zeta]²,   (12)\r\n\r\n  a _vortex line_ is defined to be such that the tangent is in the\r\n  direction of [omega], the resultant of [xi], [eta], [zeta], called the\r\n  components of molecular rotation. A small sphere of the fluid, if\r\n  frozen suddenly, would retain this angular velocity.\r\n\r\n  If [omega] vanishes throughout the fluid at any instant, equation (11)\r\n  shows that it will always be zero, and the fluid motion is then called\r\n  _irrotational_; and a function [phi] exists, called the _velocity\r\n  function_, such that\r\n\r\n    udx + vdy + wdz = -d[phi],   (13)\r\n\r\n  and then the velocity in any direction is the space-decrease or\r\n  downward gradient of [phi].\r\n\r\n  25.

this is Torricelli's theorem (1643), the\r\n  foundation of the science of hydrodynamics.\r\n\r\n  27. _Uniplanar Motion._--In the uniplanar motion of a homogeneous\r\n  liquid the equation of continuity reduces to\r\n\r\n    du   dv\r\n    -- + -- = 0,   (1)\r\n    dx   dy\r\n\r\n  so that we can put\r\n\r\n    u = -d[psi]/dy, v = d[psi]/dx,   (2)\r\n\r\n  where [psi] is a function of x, y, called the stream- or\r\n  current-function; interpreted physically, [psi] - [psi]0, the\r\n  difference of the value of [psi] at a fixed point A and a variable\r\n  point P is the flow, in ft.³/second, across any curved line AP from A\r\n  to P, this being the same for all lines in accordance with the\r\n  continuity.\r\n\r\n  Thus if d[psi] is the increase of [psi] due to a displacement from P\r\n  to P´, and k is the component of velocity normal to PP´, the flow\r\n  across PP´ is d[psi] = k·PP´; and taking PP´ parallel to Ox, d[psi] =\r\n  vdx; and similarly d[psi]= -udy with PP´ parallel to Oy; and generally\r\n  d[psi]/ds is the velocity across ds, in a direction turned through a\r\n  right angle forward, against the clock.\r\n\r\n  In the equations of uniplanar motion\r\n\r\n              dv   du   d²[psi]  d²[psi]\r\n    2[zeta] = -- - -- = ------ + ------ = -[Nabla]²[psi], suppose,   (3)\r\n              dx   dy     dx²      dy²\r\n\r\n  so that in steady motion\r\n\r\n    dH                d[psi]      dH                d[psi]        dH\r\n    -- + [Nabla]²[psi]------ = 0, -- + [Nabla]²[psi]------ = 0, ------ + [Nabla]²[psi] = 0,   (4)\r\n    dx                  dx        dy                  dy        d[psi]\r\n\r\n  and [Nabla]²[psi] must be a function of [psi].\r\n\r\n  If the motion ia irrotational,\r\n\r\n          d[phi]     d[psi]        d[phi]  d[psi]\r\n    u = - ------ = - ------, v = - ----- = ------,   (5)\r\n            dx         dy            dy      dx´\r\n\r\n  so that [psi] and [phi] are conjugate functions of x and y,\r\n\r\n    [phi] + [psi]i = [f](x + yi), [Nabla]²[psi] = 0, [Nabla]²[phi] = 0;   (6)\r\n\r\n  or putting\r\n\r\n    [phi] + [psi]i = w, x + yi = z, w = [f](z).\r\n\r\n  The curves [phi] = constant and [psi] = constant form an orthogonal\r\n  system; and the interchange of [phi] and [psi] will give a new state\r\n  of uniplanar motion, in which the velocity at every point is turned\r\n  through a right angle without alteration of magnitude.\r\n\r\n  For instance, in a uniplanar flow, radially inward towards O, the flow\r\n  across any circle of radius r being the same and denoted by 2[pi]m,\r\n  the velocity must be m/r, and\r\n\r\n    [phi] = m log r, [psi] = m[theta],\r\n      [phi] + [psi]i = m log re^(i[theta]), w = m log z.   (7)\r\n\r\n  Interchanging these values\r\n\r\n    [psi] = m log r, [phi] = m[theta],\r\n      [psi] + [phi]i = m log re^(i[theta])   (8)\r\n\r\n  gives a state of vortex motion, circulating round Oz, called a\r\n  straight or columnar vortex.\r\n\r\n  A single vortex will remain at rest, and cause a velocity at any point\r\n  inversely as the distance from the axis and perpendicular to its\r\n  direction; analogous to the magnetic field of a straight electric\r\n  current.\r\n\r\n  If other vortices are present, any one may be supposed to move with\r\n  the velocity due to the others, the resultant stream-function being\r\n\r\n    [psi] = [Sigma]m log r = log [Pi]r^m;   (9)\r\n\r\n  the path of a vortex is obtained by equating the value of [psi] at the\r\n  vortex to a constant, omitting the r^m of the vortex itself.\r\n\r\n  When the liquid is bounded by a cylindrical surface, the motion of a\r\n  vortex inside may be determined as due to a series of vortex-images,\r\n  so arranged as to make the flow zero across the boundary.\r\n\r\n  For a plane boundary the image is the optical reflection of the\r\n  vortex. For example, a pair of equal opposite vortices, moving on a\r\n  line parallel to a plane boundary, will have a corresponding pair of\r\n  images, forming a rectangle of vortices, and the path of a vortex will\r\n  be the Cotes' spiral\r\n\r\n    r sin 2[theta] = 2a, or x^(-2) + y^(-2) = a^(-2);   (10)\r\n\r\n  this is therefore the path of a single vortex in a right-angled\r\n  corner; and generally, if the angle of the corner is [pi]/n, the path\r\n  is the Cotes' spiral\r\n\r\n    r sin n[theta] = na.   (11)\r\n\r\n  A single vortex in a circular cylinder of radius a at a distance c\r\n  from the centre will move with the velocity due to an equal opposite\r\n  image at a distance a²/c, and so describe a circle with velocity\r\n\r\n    mc/(a² - c²) in the periodic time 2[pi](a² - c²)/m.   (12)\r\n\r\n  Conjugate functions can be employed also for the motion of liquid in a\r\n  thin sheet between two concentric spherical surfaces; the components\r\n  of velocity along the meridian and parallel in colatitude [theta] and\r\n  longitude [lambda] can be written\r\n\r\n     d[phi]         1        d[psi]         1         d[psi]       d[psi]\r\n    -------- = ----------- ---------,  -----------  --------- = - --------,   (13)\r\n    d[theta]   sin [theta] d[lambda]   sin [theta]  d[lambda]     d[theta]\r\n\r\n  and then\r\n\r\n    [phi] + [psi]i = F(tan ½[theta]·e^([lambda]i)).

Round the\r\n  cylinder r = a held fixed in the U current the liquid streams past\r\n  with velocity\r\n\r\n    q´ = 2U sin [theta] + m/a;   (2)\r\n\r\n  and the loss of head due to this increase of velocity from U to q´ is\r\n\r\n    q´² - U²   (2U sin [theta] + m/a)² - U²\r\n    -------- = ----------------------------,   (3)\r\n      2g                    2g\r\n\r\n  so that cavitation will take place, unless the head at a great\r\n  distance exceeds this loss.\r\n\r\n  The resultant hydrostatic thrust across any diametral plane of the\r\n  cylinder will be modified, but the only term in the loss of head which\r\n  exerts a resultant thrust on the whole cylinder is 2mU sin[theta]/ga,\r\n  and its thrust is 2[pi][rho]mU absolute units in the direction Cy, to\r\n  be counteracted by a support at the centre C; the liquid is streaming\r\n  past r = a with velocity U reversed, and the cylinder is surrounded by\r\n  a vortex. Similarly, the streaming velocity V reversed will give rise\r\n  to a thrust 2[pi][rho]mV in the direction xC.\r\n\r\n  Now if the cylinder is released, and the components U and V are\r\n  reversed so as to become the velocity of the cylinder with respect to\r\n  space filled with liquid, and at rest at infinity, the cylinder will\r\n  experience components of force per unit length\r\n\r\n  (i.) - 2[pi][rho]mV, 2[pi][rho]mU, due to the vortex motion;\r\n\r\n  (ii.) - [pi][rho]a² dU/dt, -[pi][rho]a² dV/dt, due to the kinetic\r\n  reaction of the liquid;\r\n\r\n  (iii.) 0, -[pi]([sigma] - [rho])a²g, due to gravity,\r\n\r\n  taking Oy vertically upward, and denoting the density of the cylinder\r\n  by [sigma]; so that the equations of motion are\r\n\r\n               dU                dU\r\n    [pi][rho]a²-- = - [pi][rho]a²-- - 2[pi][rho]mV,   (4)\r\n               dt                dt\r\n\r\n               dV                dV\r\n    [pi][rho]a²-- = - [pi][rho]a²-- + 2[pi][rho]mV - [pi]([sigma] - [rho])a²g,   (5)\r\n               dt                dt\r\n\r\n  or, putting m = a²[omega], so that the vortex velocity is due to an\r\n  angular velocity [omega] at a radius a,\r\n\r\n    ([sigma] + [rho])dU/dt + 2[rho][omega]V = 0,   (6)\r\n\r\n    ([sigma] + [rho])dV/dt - 2[rho][omega]U + ([sigma] - [rho])g = 0.   (7)\r\n\r\n  Thus with g = 0, the cylinder will describe a circle with angular\r\n  velocity 2[rho][omega]/([sigma] + [rho]), so that the radius is\r\n  ([sigma] + [rho])v/2[rho][omega], if the velocity is v. With [sigma] =\r\n  0, the angular velocity of the cylinder is 2[omega]; in this way the\r\n  velocity may be calculated of the propagation of ripples and waves on\r\n  the surface of a vertical whirlpool in a sink.\r\n\r\n  Restoring [sigma] will make the path of the cylinder a trochoid; and\r\n  so the swerve can be explained of the ball in tennis, cricket,\r\n  baseball, or golf.\r\n\r\n  Another explanation may be given of the sidelong force, arising from\r\n  the velocity of liquid past a cylinder, which is encircled by a\r\n  vortex. Taking two planes x = ± b, and considering the increase of\r\n  momentum in the liquid between them, due to the entry and exit of\r\n  liquid momentum, the increase across dy in the direction Oy, due to\r\n  elements at P and P´ at opposite ends of the diameter PP´, is\r\n\r\n      [rho]dy (U - Ua²r^(-2) cos 2[theta] + mr^(-1) sin [theta])(Ua²r^(-2) sin 2[theta] + mr^(-1) cos [theta])\r\n    + [rho]dy (- U + Ua²r^(-2) cos 2[theta] + mr^(-1) sin [theta])(Ua²r^(-2) sin 2[theta] - mr^(-1) cos [theta])\r\n    = 2[rho]dymUr^(-1)(cos [theta] - a^2r^(-2)cos 3[theta]),   (8)\r\n\r\n  and with y = b tan [theta], r = b sec [theta], this is\r\n\r\n    2[rho]mUd[theta] (1 - a²b^(-2) cos 3[theta] cos [theta]),   (9)\r\n\r\n  and integrating between the limits [theta] = ±½[pi], the resultant, as\r\n  before, is 2[pi][rho]mU.\r\n\r\n  31. _Example 2.--Confocal Elliptic Cylinders._--Employ the elliptic\r\n  coordinates [eta], [xi], and [zeta] = [eta] + [xi]i, such that\r\n\r\n    z = c ch[zeta], x = c ch [eta] cos [xi], y = c sh [eta] sin [zeta];   (1)\r\n\r\n  then the curves for which [eta] and [xi] are constant are confocal\r\n  ellipses and hyperbolas, and\r\n\r\n        d(x, y)\r\n    J = -------, [xi]) = c²(ch²[eta] - cos² [xi])\r\n        d([eta]\r\n\r\n      = ½c²(ch 2[eta] - cos 2[xi]) = r1r2 = OD²,   (2)\r\n\r\n  if OD is the semi-diameter conjugate to OP, and r1, r2 the focal\r\n  distances,\r\n\r\n    r1, r2 = c(ch[eta] ± cos [xi]);   (3)\r\n\r\n    r² = x² + y² = c²(ch²[eta] - sin² [xi])\r\n\r\n       = ½c²(ch 2[eta] + cos 2[xi]).

A circular vortex, such as a smoke ring, will set up motion\r\nsymmetrical about an axis, and provide an illustration; a half vortex\r\nring can be generated in water by drawing a semicircular blade a short\r\ndistance forward, the tip of a spoon for instance. The vortex advances\r\nwith a certain velocity; and if an equal circular vortex is generated\r\ncoaxially with the first, the mutual influence can be observed. The\r\nfirst vortex dilates and moves slower, while the second contracts and\r\nshoots through the first; after which the motion is reversed\r\nperiodically, as if in a game of leap-frog. Projected perpendicularly\r\nagainst a plane boundary, the motion is determined by an equal opposite\r\nvortex ring, the optical image; the vortex ring spreads out and moves\r\nmore slowly as it approaches the wall; at the same time the molecular\r\nrotation, inversely as the cross-section of the vortex, is seen to\r\nincrease. The analytical treatment of such vortex rings is the same as\r\nfor the electro-magnetic effect of a current circulating in each ring.\r\n\r\n  36. _Irrotational Motion in General._--Liquid originally at rest in a\r\n  singly-connected space cannot be set in motion by a field of force due\r\n  to a single-valued potential function; any motion set up in the liquid\r\n  must be due to a movement of the boundary, and the motion will be\r\n  irrotational; for any small spherical element of the liquid may be\r\n  considered a smooth solid sphere for a moment, and the normal pressure\r\n  of the surrounding liquid cannot impart to it any rotation.\r\n\r\n  The kinetic energy of the liquid inside a surface S due to the\r\n  velocity function [phi] is given by\r\n                _ _ _  _                                    _\r\n               / / /  |  /d[phi]\\²    /d[phi]\\²    /d[phi]\\² |\r\n    T = ½[rho] | | |  | ( ------ ) + ( ------ ) + ( ------ ) | dx dy dz,\r\n              _/_/_/  |_ \\  dx  /     \\  dy  /     \\  dz  / _|\r\n                _ _\r\n               / /       d[phi]\r\n      = ½[rho] | | [phi] ------ dS   (1)\r\n              _/_/        d[nu]\r\n\r\n  by Green's transformation, d[nu] denoting an elementary step along the\r\n  normal to the exterior of the surface; so that d[phi]/d[nu] = 0 over\r\n  the surface makes T = 0, and then\r\n\r\n     /d[phi]\\²    /d[phi]\\²    /d[phi]\\²      d[phi]      d[phi]      d[phi]\r\n    ( ------ ) + ( ------ ) + ( ------ ) = 0, ------ = 0, ------ = 0, ------ = 0   (2)\r\n     \\  dx  /     \\  dy  /     \\  dz  /         dx          dy          dz\r\n\r\n  If the actual motion at any instant is supposed to be generated\r\n  instantaneously from rest by the application of pressure impulse over\r\n  the surface, or suddenly reduced to rest again, then, since no natural\r\n  forces can act impulsively throughout the liquid, the pressure impulse\r\n  [~[omega]] satisfies the equations\r\n\r\n      1   d[~omega]         1   d[~omega]         1   d[~omega]\r\n    ----- --------- = -u, ----- --------- = -v, ----- --------- = -[~omega],   (3)\r\n    [rho]     dx          [rho]     dy          [rho]     dz\r\n\r\n    [~omega] = [rho][phi] + a constant,   (4)\r\n\r\n  and the constant may be ignored; and Green's transformation of the\r\n  energy T amounts to the theorem that the work done by an impulse is\r\n  the product of the impulse and average velocity, or half the velocity\r\n  from rest.\r\n\r\n  In a multiply connected space, like a ring, with a multiply valued\r\n  velocity function [phi], the liquid can circulate in the circuits\r\n  independently of any motion of the surface; thus, for example,\r\n\r\n    [phi] = m[theta] = m tan^(-1) y/x   (5)\r\n\r\n  will give motion to the liquid, circulating in any ring-shaped figure\r\n  of revolution round Oz.\r\n\r\n  To find the kinetic energy of such motion in a multiply connected\r\n  space, the channels must be supposed barred, and the space made\r\n  acyclic by a membrane, moving with the velocity of the liquid; and\r\n  then if k denotes the cyclic constant of [phi] in any circuit, or the\r\n  value by which [phi] has increased in completing the circuit, the\r\n  values of [phi] on the two sides of the membrane are taken as\r\n  differing by k, so that the integral over the membrane\r\n      _ _                     _ _\r\n     / /       d[phi]        / /  d[phi]\r\n     | | [phi] ------ dS = k | |  ------ dS,   (6)\r\n    _/_/        d[nu]       _/_/   d[nu]\r\n\r\n  and this term is to be added to the terms in (1) to obtain the\r\n  additional part in the kinetic energy; the continuity shows that the\r\n  integral is independent of the shape of the barrier membrane, and its\r\n  position.

For in a rigid body, rotating about Oz with angular velocity\r\n  [zeta], the circulation round a curve in the plane xy is\r\n      _\r\n     /         /  dy     dx \\\r\n     | [zeta] ( x -- - y --  ) ds = [zeta] times twice the area.

Hence in any\r\n  infinitesimal part of the fluid the circulation is zero round every\r\n  small plane curve passing through the vortex line; and consequently\r\n  the circulation round any curve drawn on the surface of a vortex\r\n  filament is zero.\r\n\r\n  If at any two points of a vortex line the cross-section ABC, A´B´C´ is\r\n  drawn of the vortex filament, joined by the vortex line AA´, then,\r\n  since the flow in AA´ is taken in opposite directions in the complete\r\n  circuit ABC AA´B´C´ A´A, the resultant flow in AA´ cancels, and the\r\n  circulation in ABC, A´B´C´ is the same; this is expressed by saying\r\n  that at all points of a vortex filament [omega][alpha] is constant\r\n  where [alpha] is the cross-section of the filament and [omega] the\r\n  resultant spin (W.

The components of velocity of the moving origin are\r\n  denoted by U, V, W, and the components of angular velocity of the\r\n  frame of reference by P, Q, R; and then if u, v, w denote the\r\n  components of fluid velocity in space, and u´, v´, w´ the components\r\n  relative to the axes at a point (x, y, z) fixed to the frame of\r\n  reference, we have\r\n\r\n    u = U + u´ - yR + zQ,   (1)\r\n    v = V + v´- zP + xR,\r\n    w = W + w´ - xQ + yP.\r\n\r\n  Now if k denotes the component of absolute velocity in a direction\r\n  fixed in space whose direction cosines are l, m, n,\r\n\r\n    k = lu + mv + nw;   (2)\r\n\r\n  and in the infinitesimal element of time dt, the coordinates of the\r\n  fluid particle at (x, y, z) will have changed by (u´, v´, w´)dt; so\r\n  that\r\n\r\n    Dk   dl    dm    dn\r\n    -- = --u + --v + --w\r\n    dt   dt    dt    dt\r\n\r\n        / du     du     du     du \\\r\n    + l(  -- + u´-- + v´-- + w´--  )\r\n        \\ dt     dx     dy     dz /\r\n\r\n        / dv     dv     dv     dv \\\r\n    + m(  -- + u´-- + v´-- + w´--  )\r\n        \\ dt     dx     dy     dz /\r\n\r\n        / dw     dw     dw     dw \\\r\n    + n(  -- + u´-- + v´-- + w´--  ).

A. Herman, _Quart. Jour. of Math._\r\n  xxii.).\r\n\r\n  Thus for m = 2, the spheres are orthogonal, and it can be verified\r\n  that\r\n\r\n                   /    a1³   a2³   a³ \\\r\n    [psi]´ = ½Uy² ( 1 - --- - --- + --  ),   (8)\r\n                   \\    r1³   r2³   r³ /\r\n\r\n  where a1, a2, a = a1a2/[root](a1² + a2²) is the radius of the spheres\r\n  and their circle of intersection, and r1, r2, r the distances of a\r\n  point from their centres.\r\n\r\n  The corresponding expression for two orthogonal cylinders will be\r\n\r\n                 /    a1²   a2²   a² \\\r\n    [psi]´ = Uy ( 1 - --- - --- + --  ).

The determination of the [phi]'s and [chi]'s is a kinematical\r\n  problem, solved as yet only for a few cases, such as those discussed\r\n  above.\r\n\r\n  But supposing them determined for the motion of a body through a\r\n  liquid, the kinetic energy T of the system, liquid and body, is\r\n  expressible as a quadratic function of the components U, V, W, P, Q,\r\n  R. The partial differential coefficient of T with respect to a\r\n  component of velocity, linear or angular, will be the component of\r\n  momentum, linear or angular, which corresponds.\r\n\r\n  Conversely, if the kinetic energy T is expressed as a quadratic\r\n  function of x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3, the components of momentum, the\r\n  partial differential coefficient with respect to a momentum component\r\n  will give the component of velocity to correspond.\r\n\r\n  These theorems, which hold for the motion of a single rigid body, are\r\n  true generally for a flexible system, such as considered here for a\r\n  liquid, with one or more rigid bodies swimming in it; and they express\r\n  the statement that the work done by an impulse is the product of the\r\n  impulse and the arithmetic mean of the initial and final velocity; so\r\n  that the kinetic energy is the work done by the impulse in starting\r\n  the motion from rest.\r\n\r\n  Thus if T is expressed as a quadratic function of U, V, W, P, Q, R,\r\n  the components of momentum corresponding are\r\n\r\n         dT       dT       dT\r\n    x1 = --, x2 = --, x3 = --,   (1)\r\n         dU       dV       dW\r\n\r\n         dT       dT       dT\r\n    y1 = --, y2 = --, y3 = --;\r\n         dP       dQ       dR\r\n\r\n  but when it is expressed as a quadratic function of x1, x2, x3, y1,\r\n  y2, y3,\r\n\r\n        dT       dT       dT\r\n    U = ---, V = ---, W = ---,   (2)\r\n        dx1      dx2      dx3\r\n\r\n        dT       dT       dT\r\n    P = ---, Q = ---, R = ---.\r\n        dy1      dy2      dy3\r\n\r\n  The second system of expression was chosen by Clebsch and adopted by\r\n  Halphen in his _Fonctions elliptiques_; and thence the dynamical\r\n  equations follow\r\n\r\n        dx1     dT      dT\r\n    X = --- - x2--- + x3---, Y = ..., Z = ...,   (3)\r\n        dt      dy3     dy2\r\n\r\n        dy1     dT      dT      dT      dT\r\n    L = --- - y2--- + y3--- - x2--- + x2---, M = ..., N = ...,   (4)\r\n        dt      dy3     dy2     dx3     dx2\r\n\r\n  where X, Y, Z, L, M, N denote components of external applied force on\r\n  the body.\r\n\r\n  These equations are proved by taking a line fixed in space, whose\r\n  direction cosines are l, m, n, then\r\n\r\n    dl            dm            dn\r\n    -- = mR - nQ, -- = nP - lR, -- = lQ - mP.

The theory preceding is of practical application in the\r\ninvestigation of the stability of the axial motion of a submarine boat,\r\nof the elongated gas bag of an airship, or of a spinning rifled\r\nprojectile. In the steady motion under no force of such a body in a\r\nmedium, the centre of gravity describes a helix, while the axis\r\ndescribes a cone round the direction of motion of the centre of gravity,\r\nand the couple causing precession is due to the displacement of the\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a medium the inertia of the body to translation is the\r\nsame in all directions, and is measured by the weight W, and under no\r\nforce the C.G. proceeds in a straight line, and the axis of rotation\r\nthrough the C.G. preserves its original direction, if a principal axis\r\nof the body; otherwise the axis describes a cone, right circular if the\r\nbody has uniaxial symmetry, and a Poinsot cone in the general case.\r\n\r\nBut the presence of the medium makes the effective inertia depend on the\r\ndirection of motion with respect to the external shape of the body, and\r\non W´ the weight of fluid medium displaced.\r\n\r\n  Consider, for example, a submarine boat under water; the inertia is\r\n  different for axial and broadside motion, and may be represented by\r\n\r\n    c1 = W + W´[alpha], c2 = W + W´[beta],   (1)\r\n\r\n  where [alpha], [beta] are numerical factors depending on the external\r\n  shape; and if the C.G. is moving with velocity V at an angle [phi]\r\n  with the axis, so that the axial and broadside component of velocity\r\n  is u = V cos [phi], v = V sin [phi], the total momentum F of the\r\n  medium, represented by the vector OF at an angle [theta] with the\r\n  axis, will have components, expressed in sec. lb.,\r\n\r\n                        u                     V                                  v                    V\r\n    F cos [theta] = c1 --- = (W + W´[alpha]) --- cos [phi], F sin [theta] = c2 --- = (W + W´[beta]) --- sin [phi].   (2)\r\n                        g                     g                                  g                    g\r\n\r\n  Suppose the body is kept from turning as it advances; after t seconds\r\n  the C.G. will have moved from O to O´, where OO´ = Vt; and at O´ the\r\n  momentum is the same in magnitude as before, but its vector is\r\n  displaced from OF to O´F´.\r\n\r\n  For the body alone the resultant of the components of momentum\r\n\r\n       V                   V                  V\r\n    W --- cos [phi] and W --- sin [phi] is W --- sec. lb.,   (3)\r\n       g                   g                  g\r\n\r\n  acting along OO´, and so is unaltered.\r\n\r\n  But the change of the resultant momentum F of the medium as well as of\r\n  the body from the vector OF to O´F´ requires an impulse couple,\r\n  tending to increase the angle FOO´, of magnitude, in sec. foot-pounds\r\n\r\n    F·OO´·sin FOO´ = FVt sin ([theta] - [phi]),   (4)\r\n\r\n  equivalent to an incessant couple\r\n\r\n    N = FV sin ([theta] - [phi])\r\n      = (F sin [theta] cos [phi] - F cos [theta] sin [phi])V\r\n      = (c2 - c1)(V²/g) sin [phi] cos [phi]\r\n      = W´([beta] - [alpha]uv/g).   (5)\r\n\r\n  This N is the couple in foot-pounds changing the momentum of the\r\n  medium, the momentum of the body alone remaining the same; the medium\r\n  reacts on the body with the same couple N in the opposite direction,\r\n  tending when c2-c1 is positive to set the body broadside to the\r\n  advance.\r\n\r\n  An oblate flattened body, like a disk or plate, has c2 - c1 negative,\r\n  so that the medium steers the body axially; this may be verified by a\r\n  plate dropped in water, and a leaf or disk or rocket-stick or piece of\r\n  paper falling in air. A card will show the influence of the couple N\r\n  if projected with a spin in its plane, when it will be found to change\r\n  its aspect in the air.\r\n\r\n  An elongated body like a ship has c2-c1 positive, and the couple N\r\n  tends to disturb the axial movement and makes it unstable, so that a\r\n  steamer requires to be steered by constant attention at the helm.\r\n\r\n  Consider a submarine boat or airship moving freely with the direction\r\n  of the resultant momentum horizontal, and the axis at a slight\r\n  inclination [theta]. With no reserve of buoyancy W = W´, and the\r\n  couple N, tending to increase [theta], has the effect of diminishing\r\n  the metacentric height by h ft. vertical, where\r\n\r\n                                  c1  u²\r\n    Wh tan[theta] = N = (c2 - c1) -- --- tan [theta],   (6)\r\n                                  c2  g\r\n\r\n        c2 - c1 c1  u²                     1 + [alpha]  u²\r\n    h = ------- -- --- = ([beta] - [alpha] ----------- ---.

An elongated shot is made to preserve its axial flight through the\r\nair by giving it the spin sufficient for stability, without which it\r\nwould turn broadside to its advance; a top in the same way is made to\r\nstand upright on the point in the position of equilibrium, unstable\r\nstatically but dynamically stable if the spin is sufficient; and the\r\ninvestigation proceeds in the same way for the two problems (see\r\nGYROSCOPE).\r\n\r\n  The effective angular inertia of the body in the medium is now\r\n  required; denote it by C1 about the axis of the figure, and by C2\r\n  about a diameter of the mean section. A rotation about the axis of a\r\n  figure of revolution does not set the medium in motion, so that C1 is\r\n  the moment of inertia of the body about the axis, denoted by Wk1².

But if\r\n  the body is perforated, the liquid can circulate through a hole, in\r\n  reentrant stream lines linked with the body, even while the body is at\r\n  rest; and no reaction from the surface can influence this circulation,\r\n  which may be supposed started in the ideal manner described in § 29,\r\n  by the application of impulsive pressure across an ideal membrane\r\n  closing the hole, by means of ideal mechanism connected with the body.\r\n  The body is held fixed, and the reaction of the mechanism and the\r\n  resultant of the impulsive pressure on the surface are a measure of\r\n  the impulse, linear [xi], [eta], [zeta], and angular [lambda], [mu],\r\n  [nu], required to start the circulation.\r\n\r\n  This impulse will remain of constant magnitude, and fixed relatively\r\n  to the body, which thus experiences an additional reaction from the\r\n  circulation which is the opposite of the force required to change the\r\n  position in space of the circulation impulse; and these extra forces\r\n  must be taken into account in the dynamical equations.\r\n\r\n  An article may be consulted in the _Phil. Mag._, April 1893, by G. H.\r\n  Bryan, in which the analytical equations of motion are deduced of a\r\n  perforated solid in liquid, from considerations purely hydrodynamical.\r\n\r\n  The effect of an external circulation of vortex motion on the motion\r\n  of a cylinder has been investigated in § 29; a similar procedure will\r\n  show the influence of circulation through a hole in a solid, taking as\r\n  the simplest illustration a ring-shaped figure, with uniplanar motion,\r\n  and denoting by [xi] the resultant axial linear momentum of the\r\n  circulation.\r\n\r\n  As the ring is moved from O to O´ in time t, with velocity Q, and\r\n  angular velocity R, the components of liquid momentum change from\r\n\r\n    [alpha]M´U + [xi] and [beta]M´V along Ox and Oy\r\n\r\n  to\r\n\r\n    [alpha]M´U´ + [xi] and [beta]M´V´ along O´x´ and O´y´,   (1)\r\n\r\n  the axis of the ring changing from Ox to O´x´; and\r\n\r\n    U = Q cos [theta], V = Q sin [theta],\r\n\r\n    U´ = Q cos ([theta] - Rt), V´ = Q sin ([theta] - Rt),   (2)\r\n\r\n  so that the increase of the components of momentum, X1, Y1, and N1,\r\n  linear and angular, are\r\n\r\n    X1 = ([alpha]M´U´ + [xi])[cos] Rt - [alpha]M´U - [xi] - [beta]M´V´ sin Rt\r\n       = ([alpha] - [beta])M´Q sin ([theta] - Rt) sin Rt - [xi] ver Rt   (3)\r\n\r\n    Y1 = ([alpha]M´U´ + [xi]) sin Rt + [beta]M´V´ cos Rt - [beta]M´V\r\n       = ([alpha] - [beta])M´Q cos ([theta] - Rt) sin Rt + [xi] sin RT,   (4)\r\n\r\n    N1 = [ -([alpha]M´U´ + [xi]) sin ([theta] - Rt) + [beta]M´V´ cos ([theta] - Rt)OO´\r\n       = [ -([alpha] - [beta])´Q cos ([theta] - Rt) sin ([theta] - Rt) - [xi] sin ([theta] - Rt)]Qt.

G. Stokes (1846), and\r\n  W. M. Hicks (1882). See also the _Fortschritte der Mathematik_, and A.\r\n  E. H. Love, \"Hydrodynamik\" in the _Encyklöpadie der mathematischen\r\n  Wissenschaften_ (1901).     (A. G. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROMEDUSAE, a group of marine animals, recognized as belonging to the\r\nHydrozoa (q.v.) by the following characters. (1) The polyp (hydropolyp)\r\nis of simple structure, typically much longer than broad, without\r\nectodermal oesophagus or mesenteries, such as are seen in the anthopolyp\r\n(see article ANTHOZOA); the mouth is usually raised above the peristome\r\non a short conical elevation or hypostome; the ectoderm is without cilia.\r\n(2) With very few exceptions, the polyp is not the only type of\r\nindividual that occurs, but alternates in the life-cycle of a given\r\nspecies, with a distinct type, the medusa (q.v.), while in other cases\r\nthe polyp-stage may be absent altogether, so that only medusa-individuals\r\noccur in the life-cycle.\r\n\r\nThe Hydromedusae represent, therefore, a sub-class of the Hydrozoa. The\r\nonly other sub-class is the Scyphomedusae (q.v.). The Hydromedusae\r\ncontrast with the Scyphomedusae in the following points. (1) The polyp,\r\nwhen present, is without the strongly developed longitudinal retractor\r\nmuscles, forming ridges (_taeniolae_) projecting into the digestive\r\ncavity, seen in the scyphistoma or scyphopolyp. (2) The medusa, when\r\npresent, has a velum and is hence said to be _craspedote_; the nervous\r\nsystem forms two continuous rings running above and below the velum; the\r\nmargin of the umbrella is not lobed (except in Narcomedusae) but entire;\r\nthere are characteristic differences in the sense-organs (see below, and\r\nSCYPHOMEDUSAE); and gastral filaments (phacellae), subgenital pits, &c.,\r\nare absent. (3) The gonads, whether formed in the polyp or the medusa,\r\nare developed in the ectoderm.\r\n\r\nThe Hydromedusae form a widespread, dominant and highly differentiated\r\ngroup of animals, typically marine, and found in all seas and in all\r\nzones of marine life. Fresh-water forms, however, are also known, very\r\nfew as regards species or genera, but often extremely abundant as\r\nindividuals. In the British fresh-water fauna only two genera, _Hydra_\r\nand _Cordylophora_, are found; in America occurs an additional genus,\r\n_Microhydra_. The paucity of fresh-water forms contrasts sharply, with\r\nthe great abundance of marine genera common in all seas and on every\r\nshore. The species of _Hydra_, however, are extremely common and\r\nfamiliar inhabitants of ponds and ditches.\r\n\r\nIn fresh-water Hydromedusae the life-cycle is usually secondarily\r\nsimplified, but in marine forms the life-cycle may be extremely\r\ncomplicated, and a given species often passes in the course of its\r\nhistory through widely different forms adapted to different habitats and\r\nmodes of life. Apart from larval or embryonic forms there are found\r\ntypically two types of person, as already stated, the polyp and the\r\nmedusa, each of which may vary independently of the other, since their\r\nenvironment and life-conditions are usually quite different. Hence both\r\npolyp and medusa present characters for classification, and a given\r\nspecies, genus or other taxonomic category may be defined by\r\npolyp-characters or medusa-characters or by both combined. If our\r\nknowledge of the life-histories of these organisms were perfect, their\r\npolymorphism would present no difficulties to classification; but\r\nunfortunately this is far from being the case. In the majority of cases\r\nwe do not know the polyp corresponding to a given medusa, or the medusa\r\nthat arises from a given polyp.[1] Even when a medusa is seen to be\r\nbudded, from a polyp under observation in an aquarium, the difficulty is\r\nnot always solved, since the freshly-liberated, immature medusa may\r\ndiffer greatly from the full-grown, sexually-mature medusa after several\r\nmonths of life on the high seas (see figs. 11, B, C, and 59, a, b, c).\r\nTo establish the exact relationship it is necessary not only to breed\r\nbut to rear the medusa, which cannot always be done in confinement. The\r\nalternative is to fish all stages of the medusa in its growth in the\r\nopen sea, a slow and laborious method in which the chance of error is\r\nvery great, unless the series of stages is very complete.\r\n\r\nAt present, therefore, classifications of the Hydromedusae have a more\r\nor less tentative character, and are liable to revision with increased\r\nknowledge of the life-histories of these organisms. Many groups bear at\r\npresent two names, the one representing the group as defined by\r\npolyp-characters, the other as defined by medusa-characters. It is not\r\neven possible in all cases to be certain that the polyp-group\r\ncorresponds exactly to the medusa-group, especially in minor systematic\r\ncategories, such as families.\r\n\r\nThe following is the main outline of the classification that is Adopted\r\nin the present article. Groups founded on polyp-characters are printed\r\nin ordinary type, those founded on medusa-characters in italics. For\r\ndefinitions of the groups see below.\r\n\r\n  Sub-class Hydromedusae (_Hydrozoa Craspedota_).\r\n\r\n  Order   I.  Eleutheroblastea.\r\n    \"    II.

Cystophorida.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Organization and Morphology of the Hydromedusae._\r\n\r\nAs already stated, there occur in the Hydromedusae two distinct types of\r\nperson, the polyp and the medusa; and either of them is capable of\r\nnon-sexual reproduction by budding, a process which may lead to the\r\nformation of colonies, composed of more or fewer individuals combined\r\nand connected together. The morphology of the group thus falls naturally\r\ninto four sections--(1) the hydropolyp, (2) the polyp-colony, (3) the\r\nhydromedusa, (4) the medusa-colonies. Since, however, medusa-colonies\r\noccur only in one group, the Siphonophora, and divergent views are held\r\nwith regard to the morphological interpretation of the members of a\r\nsiphonophore, only the first three of the above subdivisions of\r\nhydromedusa morphology will be dealt with here in a general way, and the\r\nmorphology of the Siphonophora will be considered under the heading of\r\nthe group itself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Diagram of a typical Hydropolyp.\r\n\r\n    a, Hydranth;\r\n    b, Hydrocaulus;\r\n    c, Hydrorhiza;\r\n    t, Tentacle;\r\n    ps, Perisarc, forming in the region of the hydranth a cup or\r\n      hydrotheca (h, t),--which, however, is only found in polyps of the\r\n      order Calyptoblastea.]\r\n\r\n  1. _The Hydropolyp_ (fig. 1)--The general characters of this organism\r\n  are described above and in the articles HYDROZOA and POLYP. It is\r\n  rarely free, but usually fixed and incapable of locomotion. The foot\r\n  by which it is attached often sends out root-like processes--the\r\n  _hydrorhiza_ (c). The column (b) is generally long, slender and\r\n  stalk-like (_hydrocaulus_). Just below the crown of tentacles,\r\n  however, the body widens out to form a \"head,\" termed, the _hydranth_\r\n  (a), containing a stomach-like dilatation of the digestive cavity. On\r\n  the upper face of the hydranth the crown of tentacles (t) surrounds\r\n  the peristome, from which rises the conical hypostome, bearing the\r\n  mouth at its extremity. The general ectoderm covering the surface of\r\n  the body has entirely lost the cilia present in the earlier larval\r\n  stages (planula), and may be naked, or clothed in a cuticle or\r\n  exoskeleton, the perisarc (ps), which in its simplest condition is a\r\n  chitinous membrane secreted by the ectoderm. The perisarc when present\r\n  invests the hydrorhiza and hydrocaulus; it may stop short below the\r\n  hydranth, or it may extend farther. In general there are two types of\r\n  exoskeleton, characteristic of the two principal divisions of the\r\n  Hydroidea. In the Gymnoblastea the perisarc either stops below the\r\n  hydranth, or, if continued on to it, forms a closely-fitting\r\n  investment extending as a thin cuticle as far as the bases of the\r\n  tentacles (e.g. _Bimeria_, see G. J. Allman [1],[2] pl. xii. figs, 1\r\n  and 3). In the Calyptoblastea the perisarc is always continued above\r\n  the hydrocaulus, and forms a cup, the hydrangium or hydrotheca (h, t),\r\n  standing off from the body, into which the hydranth can be retracted\r\n  for shelter and protection.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Allman's _Gymnoblastic Hydroids_, by permission of\r\n  the Council of the Ray Society.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.--_Stauridium productum_, portion of the colony magnified; p,\r\n  polyp; rh, hydrorhiza.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Diagram of _Corymorpha_. A, A hydriform person\r\n  giving rise to medusiform persons by budding from the margin of the\r\n  disk; B, free swimming medusa (_Steenstrupia_ of Forbes) detached from\r\n  the same, with manubrial genitalia, (_Anthomedusae_) and only one\r\n  tentacle. (After Allman).]\r\n\r\n  The architecture of the hydropolyp, simple though it be, furnishes a\r\n  long series of variations affecting each part of the body. The\r\n  greatest variation, however, is seen in the tentacles. As regards\r\n  number, we find in the aberrant forms _Protohydra_ and _Microhydra_\r\n  tentacles entirely absent. In the curious hydroid _Monobrachium_ a\r\n  single tentacle is present, and the same is the case in _Clathrozoon_;\r\n  in _Amphibrachium_ and in _Lar_ (fig. 11, A) the polyp bears two\r\n  tentacles only. The reduction of the tentacles in all these forms may\r\n  be correlated with their mode of life, and especially with living in a\r\n  constant current of water, which brings food-particles always from one\r\n  direction and renders a complete whorl or circle of tentacles\r\n  unnecessary. Thus _Microhydra_ lives amongst Bryozoa, and appears to\r\n  utilize the currents produced by these animals. _Protohydra_ occurs in\r\n  oyster-banks and _Monobrachium_ also grows on the shells of bivalves,\r\n  and both these hydroids probably fish in the currents produced by the\r\n  lamellibranchs. _Amphibrachium_ grows in the tissues of a sponge,\r\n  _Euplectella_, and protrudes its hydranth into the canal-system of the\r\n  sponge; and _Lar_ grows on the tubes of the worm _Sabella_. With the\r\n  exception of these forms, reduced for the most part in correlation\r\n  with a semi-parasitic mode of life, the tentacles are usually\r\n  numerous. It is rare to find in the polyp a regular, symmetrical\r\n  disposition of the tentacles as in the medusa. The primitive number of\r\n  four in a whorl is seen, however, in _Stauridium_ (fig. 2) and\r\n  _Cladonema_ (Allman [1], pl. xvii.), and in _Clavatella_ each whorl\r\n  consists regularly of eight (Allman, _loc. cit._ pl. xviii.). As a\r\n  rule, however, the number in a whorl is irregular. The tentacles may\r\n  form a single whorl, or more than one; thus in _Corymorpha_ (fig. 3)\r\n  and _Tubularia_ (fig. 4) there are two circlets; in _Stauridium_ (fig.\r\n  2) several; in _Coryne_ and _Cordylophora_ the tentacles are scattered\r\n  irregularly over the elongated hydranth.\r\n\r\n  As regards form, the tentacles show a number of types, of which the\r\n  most important are (1) filiform, _i.e._ cylindrical or tapering from\r\n  base to extremity, as in _Clava_ (fig. 5); (2) capitate, i.e. knobbed\r\n  at the extremity, as in _Coryne_ (see Allman, loc. cit. pl. iv.); (3)\r\n  branched, a rare form in the polyp, but seen in _Cladocoryne_ (see\r\n  Allman, loc. cit. p. 380, fig. 82). Sometimes more than one type of\r\n  form is found in the same polyp; in _Pennaria_ and _Stauridium_ (fig.\r\n  2) the upper whorls are capitate, the lower filiform. Finally, as\r\n  regards structure, the tentacles may retain their primitive hollow\r\n  nature, or become solid by obliteration of the axial cavity.\r\n\r\n  The hypostome of the hydropolyp may be small, or, on the other hand,\r\n  as in _Eudendrium_ (Allman, loc. cit. pls. xiii., xiv.), large and\r\n  trumpet-shaped. In the curious polyp _Myriothela_ the body of the\r\n  polyp is differentiated into nutritive and reproductive portions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Diagram of _Tubularia indivisa_. A single\r\n  hydriform person a bearing a stalk carrying numerous degenerate\r\n  medusiform persons or sporosacs b. (After Allman.)]\r\n\r\n  _Histology._--The ectoderm of the hydropolyp is chiefly sensory,\r\n  contractile and protective in function. It may also be glandular in\r\n  places. It consists of two regions, an external epithelial layer and a\r\n  more internal sub-epithelial layer.\r\n\r\n  The epithelial layer consists of (1) so-called \"indifferent\" cells\r\n  secreting the perisarc or cuticle and modified to form glandular cells\r\n  in places; for example, the adhesive cells in the foot. (2) Sensory\r\n  cells, which may be fairly numerous in places, especially on the\r\n  tentacles, but which occur always scattered and isolated, never\r\n  aggregated to form sense-organs as in the medusa. (3) Contractile or\r\n  myo-epithelial cells, with the cell prolonged at the base into a\r\n  contractile muscle-fibre (fig. 6, B). In the hydropolyp the ectodermal\r\n  muscle-fibres are always directed longitudinally. Belonging primarily\r\n  to the epithelial layer, the muscular cells may become secondarily\r\n  sub-epithelial.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Allman's _Gymnoblastic Hydroids_, by permission of\r\n  the Council of the Ray Society.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.--Colonies of _Clava_. A, _Clava squamata_, magnified. B, _C.\r\n  multicornis_, natural size; p, _polyp_; _gon_, gonophores; rh,\r\n  hydrorhiza.]\r\n\r\n  The sub-epithelial layer consists primarily of the so-called\r\n  interstitial cells, lodged between the narrowed basal portions of the\r\n  epithelial cells. From them are developed two distinct types of\r\n  histological elements; the genital cells and the cnidoblasts or\r\n  mother-cells of the nematocysts. The sub-epithelial layer thus\r\n  primarily constituted may be recruited by immigration from without of\r\n  other elements, more especially by nervous (ganglion) cells and\r\n  muscle-cells derived from the epithelial layer. In its fullest\r\n  development, therefore, the sub-epithelial layer consists of four\r\n  classes of cell-elements.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6 A.--Portion of the body-wall of _Hydra_, showing\r\n  ectoderm cells above, separated by \"structureless lamella\" from three\r\n  flagellate endoderm cells below. The latter are vacuolated, and\r\n  contain each a nucleus and several dark granules. In the middle\r\n  ectoderm cell are seen a nucleus and three nematocysts, with trigger\r\n  hairs projecting beyond the cuticle. A large nematocyst, with everted\r\n  thread, is seen in the right-hand ectodermal cell. (After F. E.\r\n  Schulze.)]\r\n\r\n  The genital cells are simple wandering cells (archaeocytes), at first\r\n  minute and without any specially distinctive features, until they\r\n  begin to develop into germ-cells. According to Wulfert [60] the\r\n  primitive germ-cells of _Gonothyraea_ can be distinguished soon after\r\n  the fixation of the planula, appearing amongst the interstitial cells\r\n  of the ectoderm. The germ-cells are capable of extensive migrations,\r\n  not only in the body of the same polyp, but also from parent to bud\r\n  through many non-sexual generations of polyps in a colony (A. Weismann\r\n  [58]).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6 B.--Epidermo-muscular cells of _Hydra_. m,\r\n  muscular-fibre processes. (After Kleinenberg, from Gegenbaur.)]\r\n\r\n  The cnidoblasts are the mother-cells of the nematocysts, each cell\r\n  producing one nematocyst in its interior. The complete nematocyst\r\n  (fig. 7) is a spherical or oval capsule containing a hollow thread,\r\n  usually barbed, coiled in its interior. The capsule has a double wall,\r\n  an outer one (o.c.), tough and rigid in nature, and an inner one\r\n  (i.c.) of more flexible consistence. The outer wall of the capsule is\r\n  incomplete at one pole, leaving an aperture through which the thread\r\n  is discharged. The inner membrane is continuous with the wall of the\r\n  hollow thread at a spot immediately below the aperture in the outer\r\n  wall, so that the thread itself (f) is simply a hollow prolongation of\r\n  the wall of the inner capsule inverted and pushed into its cavity. The\r\n  entire nematocyst is enclosed in the cnidoblast which formed it. When\r\n  the nematocyst is completely developed, the cnidoblast passes outwards\r\n  so as to occupy a superficial position in the ectoderm, and a delicate\r\n  protoplasmic process of sensory nature, termed the _cnidocil_ (cn)\r\n  projects from the cnidoblast like a fine hair or cilium. Many points\r\n  in the development and mechanism of the nematocyst are disputed, but\r\n  it is tolerably certain (1) that the cnidocil is of sensory nature,\r\n  and that stimulation, by contact with prey or in other ways, causes a\r\n  reflex discharge of the nematocyst; (2) that the discharge is an\r\n  explosive change whereby the in-turned thread is suddenly everted and\r\n  turned inside out, being thus shot through the opening in the outer\r\n  wall of the capsule, and forced violently into the tissues of the\r\n  prey, or, it may be, of an enemy; (3) that the thread inflicts not\r\n  merely a mechanical wound, but instils an irritant poison, numbing and\r\n  paralysing in its action. The points most in dispute are, first, how\r\n  the explosive discharge is brought about, whether by pressure exerted\r\n  external to the capsule (i.e. by contraction of the cnidoblast) or by\r\n  internal pressure. N. Iwanzov [27] has brought forward strong grounds\r\n  for the latter view, pointing out that the cnidoblast has no\r\n  contractile mechanism and that measurements show discharged capsules\r\n  to be on the average slightly larger than undischarged ones. He\r\n  believes that the capsule contains a substance which swells very\r\n  rapidly when brought into contact with water, and that in the\r\n  undischarged condition the capsule has its opening closed by a plug of\r\n  protoplasm (x, fig. 7) which prevents access of water to the contents;\r\n  when the cnidocil is stimulated it sets in action a mechanism or\r\n  perhaps a series of chemical changes by which the plug is dissolved or\r\n  removed; as a result water penetrates into the capsule and causes its\r\n  contents to swell, with the result that the thread is everted\r\n  violently. A second point of dispute concerns the spot at which the\r\n  poison is lodged. Iwanzov believes it to be contained within the\r\n  thread itself before discharge, and to be introduced into the tissues\r\n  of the prey by the eversion of the thread. A third point of dispute is\r\n  whether the nematocysts are formed _in situ_, or whether the\r\n  cnidoblasts migrate with them to the region where they are most\r\n  needed; the fact that in _Hydra_, for example, there are no\r\n  interstitial cells in the tentacles, where nematocysts are very\r\n  abundant, is certainly in favour of the view that the cnidoblasts\r\n  migrate on to the tentacles from the body, and that like the genital\r\n  cells the cnidoblasts are wandering cells.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Diagrams to show the structure of Nematocysts\r\n  and their mode of working.

A further stage in evolution is that the\r\n  muscle-cells lose their connexion with the epithelium and come to lie\r\n  entirely beneath it, forming a sub-epithelial contractile layer,\r\n  developed chiefly in the tentacles of the polyp. The evolution of the\r\n  ganglion-cells, is probably similar; an epithelial cell develops\r\n  processes of nervous nature from the base, which come into connexion\r\n  with the bases of the sensory cells, with the muscular cells, and with\r\n  the similar processes of other nerve-cells; next the nerve-cell loses\r\n  its connexion with the outer epithelium and becomes a sub-epithelial\r\n  ganglion-cell which is closely connected with the muscular layer,\r\n  conveying stimuli from the sensory cells to the contractile elements.\r\n  The ganglion-cells of Hydromedusae are generally very small. In the\r\n  polyp the nervous tissue is always in the form of a scattered plexus,\r\n  never concentrated to form a definite nervous system as in the medusa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Gegenbaur's _Elements of Comparative Anatomy_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.--Vacuolated Endoderm Cells of cartilaginous consistence from\r\n  the axis of the tentacle of a Medusa (_Cunina_).]\r\n\r\n  The endoderm of the polyp is typically a flagellated epithelium of\r\n  large cells (fig. 6), from the bases of which arise contractile\r\n  muscular processes lying in the plane of the transverse section of the\r\n  body. In different parts of the coelenteron the endoderm may be of\r\n  three principal types--(1) digestive endoderm, the primitive type,\r\n  with cells of large size and considerably vacuolated, found in the\r\n  hydranth; some of these cells may become special glandular cells,\r\n  without flagella or contractile processes; (2) circulatory endoderm,\r\n  without vacuoles and without basal contractile processes, found in the\r\n  hydrorhiza and hydrocaulus; (3) supporting endoderm (fig. 8), seen in\r\n  solid tentacles as a row of cubical vacuolated cells, occupying the\r\n  axis of the tentacle, greatly resembling notochordal tissue,\r\n  particularly that of _Amphioxus_ at a certain stage of development; as\r\n  a fourth variety of endodermal cells excretory cells should perhaps be\r\n  reckoned, as seen in the pores in the foot of _Hydra_ and elsewhere\r\n  (cf. C. Chun, HYDROZOA [1], pp. 314, 315).\r\n\r\n  The mesogloea in the hydropolyp is a thin elastic layer, in which may\r\n  be lodged the muscular fibres and ganglion cells mentioned above, but\r\n  which never contains any connective tissue or skeletogenous cells or\r\n  any other kind of special mesogloeal corpuscles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Allman's _Gymnoblastic Hydroids_, by permission of\r\n  the Council of the Ray Society.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.--Colony of _Hydractinia echinata_, growing on the Shell of a\r\n  Whelk.

The buds may all become detached after a time and\r\n  give rise to separate and independent individuals, as in the common\r\n  _Hydra_, in which only polyp-individuals are produced and sexual\r\n  elements are developed upon the polyps themselves; or, on the other\r\n  hand, the polyp-individuals produced by budding may remain permanently\r\n  in connexion with the parent polyp, in which case sexual elements are\r\n  never developed on polyp-individuals but only on medusa-individuals,\r\n  and a true colony is formed. Thus the typical hydroid colony starts\r\n  from a \"founder\" polyp, which in the vast majority of cases is fixed,\r\n  but which may be floating, as in _Nemopsis_, _Pelagohydra_, &c. The\r\n  founder-polyp usually produces by budding polyp-individuals, and these\r\n  in their turn produce other buds. The polyps are all non-sexual\r\n  individuals whose function is purely nutritive. After a time the\r\n  polyps, or certain of them, produce by budding medusa-individuals,\r\n  which sooner or later develop sexual elements; in some cases, however,\r\n  the founder-polyp remains solitary, that is to say, does not produce\r\n  polyp-buds, but only medusa-buds, from the first (_Corymorpha_, fig.\r\n  3, _Myriothela_, &c.). In primitive forms the medusa-individuals are\r\n  set free before reaching sexual maturity and do not contribute\r\n  anything to the colony. In other cases, however, the\r\n  medusa-individuals become sexually mature while still attached to the\r\n  parent polyp, and are then not set free at all, but become appanages\r\n  of the hydroid colony and undergo degenerative changes leading to\r\n  reduction and even to complete obliteration of their original medusan\r\n  structure. In this way the hydroid colony becomes composed of two\r\n  portions of different function, the nutritive \"trophosome,\" composed\r\n  of non-sexual polyps, and the reproductive \"gonosome,\" composed of\r\n  sexual medusa-individuals, which never exercise a nutritive function\r\n  while attached to the colony. As a general rule polyp-buds are\r\n  produced from the hydrorhiza and hydrocaulus, while medusa-buds are\r\n  formed on the hydranth. In some cases, however, medusa-buds are formed\r\n  on the hydrorhiza, as in Hydrocorallines.\r\n\r\n  In such a colony of connected individuals, the exact limits of the\r\n  separate \"persons\" are not always clearly marked out. Hence it is\r\n  necessary to distinguish between, first, the \"zooids,\" indicated in\r\n  the case of the polyps by the hydranths, each with mouth and\r\n  tentacles; and, secondly, the \"coenosarc,\" or common flesh, which\r\n  cannot be assigned more to one individual than another, but consists\r\n  of a more or less complicated network of tubes, corresponding to the\r\n  hydrocaulus and hydrorhiza of the primitive independent\r\n  polyp-individual. The coenosarc constitutes a system by which the\r\n  digestive cavity of any one polyp is put into communication with that\r\n  of any other individual either of the trophosome or gonosome. In this\r\n  manner the food absorbed by one individual contributes to the welfare\r\n  of the whole colony, and the coenosarc has the function of circulating\r\n  and distributing nutriment through the colony.\r\n\r\n  The hydroid colony shows many variations in form and architecture\r\n  which depend simply upon differences in the methods in which polyps\r\n  are budded.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Hincks, Forbes, and Browne. A and B modified from\r\n  Hincks; C modified from Forbes's _Brit. Naked-eyed Medusae_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.--_Lar sabellarum_ and two stages of its Medusa, _Willia\r\n  stellata_. A, colony of _Lar_; B and C, young and adult medusae.]\r\n\r\n  In the first place, buds may be produced only from the hydrorhiza,\r\n  which grows out and branches to form a basal _stolon_, typically\r\n  net-like, spreading over the substratum to which the founder-polyp\r\n  attached itself. From the stolon the daughter-polyps grow up\r\n  vertically. The result is a spreading or creeping colony, with the\r\n  coenosarc in the form of a root-like horizontal network (fig. 5, B;\r\n  11, A). Such a colony may undergo two principal modifications. The\r\n  meshes of the basal network may become very small or virtually\r\n  obliterated, so that the coenosarc becomes a crust of tubes tending to\r\n  fuse together, and covered over by a common perisarc. Encrusting\r\n  colonies of this kind are seen in _Clava squamata_ (fig. 5, A) and\r\n  _Hydractinia_ (figs. 9, 10), the latter having the perisarc calcified.\r\n  A further very important modification is seen when the tubes of the\r\n  basal perisarc do not remain spread out in one plane, but grow in all\r\n  planes forming a felt-work; the result is a massive colony, such as is\r\n  seen in the so-called Hydrocorallines (fig. 60), where the interspaces\r\n  between the coenosarcal tubes are filled up with calcareous matter, or\r\n  _coenosteum_, replacing the chitinous perisarc. The result is a stony,\r\n  solid mass, which contributes to the building up of coral reefs. In\r\n  massive colonies of this kind no sharp distinction can be drawn\r\n  between hydrorhiza and hydrocaulus in the coenosarc; it is practically\r\n  all hydrorhiza. Massive colonies may assume various forms and are\r\n  often branching or tree-like. A further peculiarity of this type of\r\n  colony is that the entire coenosarcal complex is covered externally by\r\n  a common layer of ectoderm; it is not clear how this covering layer is\r\n  developed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Colony of _Bougainvillea fruticosa_, natural\r\n  size, attached to the underside of a piece of floating timber. (After\r\n  Allman.)]\r\n\r\n  In the second place, the buds may be produced from the hydrocaulus,\r\n  growing out laterally from it; the result is an arborescent, tree-like\r\n  colony (figs. 12, 13). Budding from the hydrocaulus may be combined\r\n  with budding from the hydrorhiza, so that numerous branching colonies\r\n  arise from a common basal stolon. In the formation of arborescent\r\n  colonies, two sharply distinct types of budding are found, which are\r\n  best described in botanical terminology as the monopodial or racemose,\r\n  and the sympodial or cymose types respectively; each is characteristic\r\n  of one of the two sub-orders of the Hydroidea, the Gymnoblastea and\r\n  Calyptoblastea.\r\n\r\n  In the monopodial method (figs. 12, 14) the founder-polyp is,\r\n  theoretically, of unlimited growth in a vertical direction, and as it\r\n  grows up it throws out buds right and left alternately, so that the\r\n  first bud produced by it is the lowest down, the second bud is above\r\n  the first, the third above this again, and so on. Each bud produced by\r\n  the founder proceeds to grow and to bud in the same way as the founder\r\n  did, producing a side branch of the main stem. Hence, in a colony of\r\n  gymnoblastic hydroids, the oldest polyp of each system, that is to\r\n  say, of the main stem or of a branch, is the topmost polyp; the\r\n  youngest polyp of the system is the one nearest to the topmost polyp;\r\n  and the axis of the system is a true axis.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Portion of colony of _Bougainvillea\r\n  fruticosa_ (_Anthomedusae-Gymnoblastea_) more magnified. (From\r\n  Lubbock, after Allman.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Diagrams of the monopodial method of budding,\r\n  shown in five stages (1-5). F, the founder-polyp; 1, 2, 3, 4, the\r\n  succession of polyps budded from the founder-polyp; a´, b´, c´, the\r\n  succession of polyps budded from 1; a², b², polyps budded from 2; a³,\r\n  polyp budded from 3.]\r\n\r\n  In the sympodial method of budding, on the other hand, the\r\n  founder-polyp is of limited growth, and forms a bud from its side,\r\n  which is also of limited growth, and forms a bud in its turn, and so\r\n  on (figs. 15, 16). Hence, in a colony of calyptoblastic hydroids, the\r\n  oldest polyp of a system is the lowest; the youngest polyp is the\r\n  topmost one; and the axis of the system is a false axis composed of\r\n  portions of each of the consecutive polyps. In this method of budding\r\n  there are two types. In one, the biserial type (fig. 15), the polyps\r\n  produce buds right and left alternately, so that the hydranths are\r\n  arranged in a zigzag fashion, forming a \"scorpioid cyme,\" as in\r\n  _Obelia_ and _Sertularia_. In the other, the uniserial type (fig. 16),\r\n  the buds are formed always on the same side, forming a \"helicoid\r\n  cyme,\" as in _Hydrallmania_, according to H. Driesch, in which,\r\n  however, the primitively uniserial arrangement becomes masked later by\r\n  secondary torsions of the hydranths.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Diagram of sympodial budding, biserial type,\r\n  shown in five stages (1-5). F, founder-polyp; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\r\n  succession of polyps budded from the founder; a, b, c, second series\r\n  of polyps budded from the founder; a³, b³, series budded from 3.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Diagram of sympodial budding, uniserial type,\r\n  shown in four stages (1-4). F, founder-polyp; 1, 2, 3, succession of\r\n  polyps budded from the founder.]\r\n\r\n  In a colony formed by sympodial budding, a polyp always produces first\r\n  a bud, which contributes to the system to which it belongs, i.e.\r\n  continues the stem or branch of which its parent forms a part. The\r\n  polyp may then form a second bud, which becomes the starting point of\r\n  a new system, the beginning, that is, of a new branch; and even a\r\n  third bud, starting yet another system, may be produced from the same\r\n  polyp. Hence the colonies of Calyptoblastea may be complexly branched,\r\n  and the budding may be biserial throughout, uniserial throughout, or\r\n  partly one, partly the other. Thus in _Plumularidae_ (figs. 17, 18)\r\n  there is formed a main stem by biserial budding; each polyp on the\r\n  main stem forms a second bud, which usually forms a side branch or\r\n  _pinnule_ by uniserial budding. In this way are formed the familiar\r\n  feathery colonies of _Plumularia_, in which the pinnules are all in\r\n  one plane, while in the allied _Antennularia_ the pinnules are\r\n  arranged in whorls round the main biserial stem. The pinnules never\r\n  branch again, since in the uniserial mode of budding a polyp never\r\n  forms a second polyp-bud. On the other hand, a polyp on the main stem\r\n  may form a second bud which, instead of forming a pinnule by uniserial\r\n  budding, produces by biserial budding a branch, from which pinnules\r\n  arise as from the main stem (fig. 18--3, 6). Or a polyp on the main\r\n  stem, after having budded a second time to form a pinnule, may give\r\n  rise to a third bud, which starts a new biserial system, from which\r\n  uniserial pinnules arise as from the main stem--type of _Aglaophenia_\r\n  (fig. 19). The laws of budding in hydroids have been worked out in an\r\n  interesting manner by H. Driesch [13], to whose memoirs the reader\r\n  must be referred for further details.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Diagram of sympodial budding, simple\r\n  unbranched _Plumularia_-type. F, founder; 1-8, main axis formed by\r\n  biserial budding from founder; a-e, pinnule formed by uniserial\r\n  budding from founder; a¹-d¹, branch formed by similar budding from 1;\r\n  a²-d² from 2, and so forth.]\r\n\r\n  _Individualization of Polyp-Colonies._--As in other cases where animal\r\n  colonies are formed by organic union of separate individuals, there is\r\n  ever a tendency for the polyp-colony as a whole to act as a single\r\n  individual, and for the members to become subordinated to the needs of\r\n  the colony and to undergo specialization for particular functions,\r\n  with the result that they simulate organs and their individuality\r\n  becomes masked to a greater or less degree. Perhaps the earliest of\r\n  such specializations is connected with the reproductive function.\r\n  Whereas primitively any polyp in a colony may produce medusa-buds, in\r\n  many hydroid colonies medusae are budded only by certain polyps termed\r\n  _blastostyles_ (fig. 10, b). At first not differing in any way from\r\n  other polyps (fig. 5), the blastostyles gradually lose their nutritive\r\n  function and the organs connected with it; the mouth and tentacles\r\n  disappear, and the blastostyle obtains the nutriment necessary for its\r\n  activity by way of the coenosarc. In the Calyptoblastea, where the\r\n  polyps are protected by special capsules of the perisarc, the\r\n  _gonothecae_ enclosing the blastostyles differ from the hydrothecae\r\n  protecting the hydranths (fig. 54).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--Diagram showing method of branching in the\r\n  _Plumularia_-type; compare with fig. 17. Polyps 3 and 6, instead of\r\n  producing uniserial pinnules, have produced biserial branches (3¹, 3²,\r\n  3³, 3^4; 6¹-6³), which give off uniserial branches in their turn.]\r\n\r\n  In other colonies the two functions of the nutritive polyp, namely,\r\n  capture and digestion of food, may be shared between different polyps\r\n  (fig. 10). One class of polyps, the _dactylozoids_ (dz), lose their\r\n  mouth and stomach, and become elongated and tentacle-like, showing\r\n  great activity of movement. Another class, the _gastrozoids_ (gz),\r\n  have the tentacles reduced or absent, but have the mouth and stomach\r\n  enlarged. The dactylozoids capture food, and pass it on to the\r\n  gastrozoids, which swallow and digest it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--Diagram showing method of branching in the\r\n  _Aglaophenia_-type. Polyp 7 has produced as its first bud, 8; as its\r\n  second bud, a^7, which starts a uniserial pinnule; and as a third bud\r\n  I^7, which starts a biserial branch (II^7-VI^7) that repeats the\r\n  structure of the main stem and gives off pinnules. The main stem is\r\n  indicated by-·-·-·, the new stem by ······.]\r\n\r\n  Besides the three types of individual above mentioned, there are other\r\n  appendages of hydroid colonies, of which the individuality is\r\n  doubtful. Such are the \"guard-polyps\" (machopolyps) of _Plumularidae_,\r\n  which are often regarded as individuals of the nature of dactylozoids,\r\n  but from a study of the mode of budding in this hydroid family Driesch\r\n  concluded that the guard-polyps were not true polyp-individuals,\r\n  although each is enclosed in a small protecting cup of the perisarc,\r\n  known as a nematophore. Again, the spines arising from the basal crust\r\n  of _Podocoryne_ have been interpreted by some authors as reduced\r\n  polyps.\r\n\r\n  3. _The Medusa._--In the Hydromedusae the medusa-individual occurs, as\r\n  already stated, in one of two conditions, either as an independent\r\n  organism leading a true life in the open seas, or as a subordinate\r\n  individuality in the hydroid colony, from which it is never set free;\r\n  it then becomes a mere reproductive appendage or _gonophore_, losing\r\n  successively its organs of sense, locomotion and nutrition, until its\r\n  medusoid nature and organization become scarcely recognizable. Hence\r\n  it is convenient to consider the morphology of the medusa from these\r\n  two aspects.\r\n\r\n  (a) _The Medusa as an Independent Organism._--The general structure\r\n  and characteristics of the medusa are described elsewhere (see\r\n  articles HYDROZOA and MEDUSA), and it is only necessary here to deal\r\n  with the peculiarities of the Hydromedusa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Allman's _Gymnoblastic Hydroids_, by permission of\r\n  the Council of the Ray Society.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 20.--_Cladonema radiatum_, the medusa walking on the basal\r\n  branches of its tentacles (t), which are turned up over the body.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Allman's _Gymnoblastic Hydroids_, by permission of\r\n  the Council of the Ray Society.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 21.--_Clavatella prolifera_, ambulatory medusa. t, tentacles; oc,\r\n  ocelli.]\r\n\r\n  As regards habit of life the vast majority of Hydromedusae are pelagic\r\n  organisms, floating on the surface of the open sea, propelling\r\n  themselves feebly by the pumping movements of the umbrella produced by\r\n  contraction of the sub-umbral musculature, and capturing their prey\r\n  with their tentacles. The genera _Cladonema_ (fig. 20) and\r\n  _Clavatella_ (fig. 21), however, are ambulatory, creeping forms,\r\n  living in rock-pools and walking, as it were, on the tips of the\r\n  proximal branches of each of the tentacles, while the remaining\r\n  branches serve for capture of food. _Cladonema_ still has the typical\r\n  medusan structure, and is able to swim about, but in _Clavatella_ the\r\n  umbrella is so much reduced, that swimming is no longer possible. The\r\n  remarkable medusa _Mnestra parasites_ is ecto-parasitic throughout\r\n  life on the pelagic mollusc _Phyllirrhoe_, attached to it by the\r\n  sub-umbral surface, and its tentacles have become rudimentary or\r\n  absent. It is interesting to note that _Mnestra_ has been shown by J.\r\n  W. Fewkes [15] and R. T. Günther [19] to belong to the same family\r\n  (_Cladonemidae_) as _Cladonema_ and _Clavatella_, and it is reasonable\r\n  to suppose that the non-parasitic ancestor of _Mnestra_ was, like the\r\n  other two genera, an ambulatory medusa which acquired louse-like\r\n  habits. In some species of the genus _Cunina_ (Narcomedusae) the\r\n  youngest individuals (actinulae) are parasitic on other medusae (see\r\n  below), but in later life the parasitic habit is abandoned. No other\r\n  instances are known of sessile habit in Hydromedusae.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After E. T. Browne, from _Proc. Zool. Soc. of London_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.--_Corymorpha nutans_, adult female Medusa. Magnified 10\r\n  diameters.]\r\n\r\n  The external form of the Hydromedusae varies from that of a deep bell\r\n  or thimble, characteristic of the Anthomedusae, to the shallow\r\n  saucer-like form characteristic of the Leptomedusae. It is usual for\r\n  the umbrella to have an even, circular, uninterrupted margin; but in\r\n  the order Narcomedusae secondary down-growths between the tentacles\r\n  produce a lobed, indented margin to the umbrella. The marginal\r\n  tentacles are rarely absent in non-parasitic forms, and are typically\r\n  four in number, corresponding to the four perradii marked by the\r\n  radial canals. Interradial tentacles may be also developed, so that\r\n  the total number present may be increased to eight or to an\r\n  indefinitely large number. In _Willia_, _Geryonia_, &c., however, the\r\n  tentacles and radial canals are on the plan of six instead of four\r\n  (figs. 11 and 26). On the other hand, in some cases the tentacles are\r\n  less in number than the perradii; in _Corymorpha_ (figs. 3 and 22)\r\n  there is but a single tentacle, while two are found in _Amphinema_ and\r\n  _Gemmaria_ (Anthomedusae), and in _Solmundella bitentaculata_ (fig.\r\n  67) and _Aeginopsis hensenii_ (fig. 23) (Narcomedusae). The tentacles\r\n  also vary considerably in other ways than in number: first, in form,\r\n  being usually simple, with a basal bulb, but in _Cladonemidae_ they\r\n  are branched, often in complicated fashion; secondly, in grouping,\r\n  being usually given off singly, and at regular intervals from the\r\n  margin of the umbrella, but in _Margelidae_ and in some Trachomedusae\r\n  they are given off in tufts or bunches (fig. 24); thirdly, in position\r\n  and origin, being usually implanted on the extreme edge of the\r\n  umbrella, but in Narcomedusae they become secondarily shifted and are\r\n  given off high up on the ex-umbrella (figs. 23 and 25); and, fourthly,\r\n  in structure, being hollow or solid, as in the polyp. In some medusae,\r\n  for instance, the remarkable deep-sea family _Pectyllidae_, the\r\n  tentacles may bear suckers, by which the animal may attach itself\r\n  temporarily. It should be mentioned finally that the tentacles are\r\n  very contractile and extensible, and may therefore present themselves,\r\n  in one and the same individual, as long, drawn-out threads, or in the\r\n  form of short corkscrew-like ringlets; they may stream downwards from\r\n  the sub-umbrella, or be held out horizontally, or be directed upwards\r\n  over the ex-umbrella (fig. 23). Each species of medusa usually has a\r\n  characteristic method of carrying its tentacles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After O. Maas, _Die craspedoten Medusen der Plankton\r\n  Expedition_, by permission of Lipsius and Tischer.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.--_Aeginopsis hensenii_, slightly magnified, showing the\r\n  manner in which the tentacles are carried in life.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After O. Maas, _Craspedoten Medusen der\r\n  Siboga-Expedition_, by permission of E. S. Brill & Co.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 24.--_Rathkea octonemalis._]\r\n\r\n  The sub-umbrella invariably shows a velum as an inwardly projecting\r\n  ridge or rim at its margin, within the circle of tentacles; hence the\r\n  medusae of this sub-class are termed craspedote. The manubrium is\r\n  absent altogether in the fresh-water medusa _Limnocnida_, in which the\r\n  diameter of the mouth exceeds half that of the umbrella; on the other\r\n  hand, the manubrium may attain a great length, owing to the centre of\r\n  the sub-umbrella with the stomach being drawn into it, as it were, to\r\n  form a long proboscis, as in _Geryonia_. The mouth may be a simple,\r\n  circular pore at the extremity of the manubrium, or by folding of the\r\n  edges it may become square or shaped like a Maltese cross, with four\r\n  corners and four lips. The corners of the mouth may then be drawn out\r\n  into lobes or lappets, which may have a branched or fringed outline\r\n  (fig. 27), and in _Margelidae_ the subdivisions of the fringe simulate\r\n  tentacles (fig. 24).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After O. Maas, _Medusae_, in Prince of Monaco's series.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 25.--_Aeginura grimaldii._]\r\n\r\n  The internal anatomy of the Hydromedusae shows numerous variations.\r\n  The stomach may be altogether lodged in the manubrium, from which the\r\n  radial canals then take origin directly as in _Geryonia_\r\n  (Trachomedusae); it may be with or without gastric pouches. The radial\r\n  canals may be simple or branched, primarily four, rarely six in\r\n  number. The ring-canal is drawn out in Narcomedusae into festoons\r\n  corresponding with the lobes of the margin, and may be obliterated\r\n  altogether (_Solmaris_). In this order the radial canals are\r\n  represented only by wide gastric pouches, and in the family Solmaridae\r\n  are suppressed altogether, so that the tentacles and the festoons of\r\n  the ring-canal arise directly from the stomach. In _Geryonia_,\r\n  centripetal canals, ending blindly, arise from the ring-canal and run\r\n  in a radial direction towards the centre of the umbrella (fig. 26).\r\n\r\n  _Histology of the Hydromedusa._--The histology described above for the\r\n  polyp may be taken as the primitive type, from which that of the\r\n  medusa differs only in greater elaboration and differentiation of the\r\n  cell-elements, which are also more concentrated to form distinct\r\n  tissues.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 26.--_Carmarina (Geryonia) hastata_, one of the\r\n  _Trachomedusae_.

The external\r\n  epithelium is flat on the ex-umbral surface, more columnar on the\r\n  sub-umbral surface, where it forms the muscular tissue of the\r\n  sub-umbrella and the velum. The nematocysts of the ectoderm may be\r\n  grouped to form batteries on the tentacles, umbrellar margin and oral\r\n  lappets. In places the nematocysts may be crowded so thickly as to\r\n  form a tough, supporting, \"chondral\" tissue, resembling cartilage,\r\n  chiefly developed at the margin of the umbrella and forming streaks or\r\n  bars supporting the tentacles (\"Tentakelspangen,\" _peronia_) or the\r\n  tentaculocysts (\"Gehörspangen,\" _otoporpae_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After O. Maas in _Results of the \"Albatross\"\r\n  Expedition_, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 27.--_Stomotoca divisa_, one of the _Tiaridae_ (Anthomedusae).]\r\n\r\n  The muscular tissue of the Hydromedusae is entirely ectodermal. The\r\n  muscle-fibres arise as processes from the bases of the epithelial\r\n  cells; such cells may individually become sub-epithelial in position,\r\n  as in the polyp; or, in places where muscular tissue is greatly\r\n  developed, as in the velum or sub-umbrella, the entire muscular\r\n  epithelium may be thrown into folds in order to increase its surface,\r\n  so that a deeper sub-epithelial muscular layer becomes separated\r\n  completely from a more superficial body-epithelium.\r\n\r\n  In its arrangement the muscular tissue forms two systems: the one\r\n  composed of striated fibres arranged circularly, that is to say,\r\n  concentrically round the central axis of the umbrella; the other of\r\n  non-striated fibres running longitudinally, that is to say, in a\r\n  radial direction from, or (in the manubrium) parallel to, the same\r\n  ideal axis. The circular system is developed continuously over the\r\n  entire sub-umbral surface, and the velum represents a special local\r\n  development of this system, at a region where it is able to act at the\r\n  greatest mechanical advantage in producing the contractions of the\r\n  umbrella by which the animal progresses. The longitudinal system is\r\n  discontinuous, and is subdivided into proximal, medial and distal\r\n  portions. The proximal portion forms the retractor muscles of the\r\n  manubrium, or proboscis, well developed, for example, in _Geryonia_.\r\n  The medial portion forms radiating tracts of fibres, the so-called\r\n  \"bell-muscles\" running underneath, and parallel to, the radial canals;\r\n  when greatly developed, as in _Tiaridae_, they form ridges, so-called\r\n  mesenteries, projecting into the sub-umbral cavity. The distal\r\n  portions form the muscles of the tentacles. In contrast with the\r\n  polyp, the longitudinal muscle-system is entirely ectodermal, there\r\n  being no endodermal muscles in craspedote medusae.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 28.--Muscular Cells of Medusae (_Lizzia_). The\r\n  uppermost is a purely muscular cell from the sub-umbrella; the two\r\n  lower are epidermo-muscular cells from the base of a tentacle; the\r\n  upstanding nucleated portion forms part of the epidermal mosaic on the\r\n  free surface of the body. (After Hertwig.)]\r\n\r\n  The nervous system of the medusa consists of sub-epithelial\r\n  ganglion-cells, which form, in the first place, a diffuse plexus of\r\n  nervous tissue, as in the polyp, but developed chiefly on the\r\n  sub-umbral surface; and which are concentrated, in the second place,\r\n  to form a definite central nervous system, never found in the polyp.\r\n  In Hydromedusae the central nervous system forms two concentric\r\n  nerve-rings at the margin of the umbrella, near the base of the velum.\r\n  One, the \"upper\" or ex-umbral nerve-ring, is derived from the ectoderm\r\n  on the ex-umbral side of the velum; it is the larger of the two rings,\r\n  containing more numerous but smaller ganglion-cells, and innervates\r\n  the tentacles. The other, the \"lower\" or sub-umbral nerve-ring, is\r\n  derived from the ectoderm on the sub-umbral side of the velum; it\r\n  contains fewer but larger ganglion-cells and innervates the muscles of\r\n  the velum (see diagram in article MEDUSAE). The two nerve-rings are\r\n  connected by fibres passing from one to the other.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After O. Maas, _Craspedoten Medusen der Siboga\r\n  Expedition_, by permission of E. S. Brill & Co.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.--_Tiaropsis rosea_ (Ag. and Mayer) showing the eight adradial\r\n  Statocysts, each close to an Ocellus. Cf. fig. 30.]\r\n\r\n  The sensory cells are slender epithelial cells, often with a cilium or\r\n  stiff protoplasmic process, and should perhaps be regarded as the only\r\n  ectoderm-cells which retain the primitive ciliation of the larval\r\n  ectoderm, otherwise lost in all Hydrozoa. The sense-cells form, in the\r\n  first place, a diffuse system of scattered sensory cells, as in the\r\n  polyp, developed chiefly on the manubrium, the tentacles and the\r\n  margin of the umbrella, where they form a sensory ciliated epithelium\r\n  covering the nerve-centres; in the second place, the sense-cells are\r\n  concentrated to form definite sense-organs, situated always at the\r\n  margin of the umbrella, hence often termed \"marginal bodies.\" The\r\n  possession of definite sense-organs at once distinguishes the medusa\r\n  from the polyp, in which they are never found.\r\n\r\n  The sense-organs of medusae are of two kinds--first, organs sensitive\r\n  to light, usually termed _ocelli_ (fig. 29); secondly, organs commonly\r\n  termed _otocysts_, on account of their resemblance to the auditory\r\n  vesicles of higher animals, but serving for the sense of balance and\r\n  orientation, and therefore given the special name of _statocysts_\r\n  (fig. 30). The sense-organs may be _tentaculocysts_, i.e.\r\n  modifications of a tentacle, as in Trachylinae, or developed from the\r\n  margin of the umbrella, in no connexion with a tentacle (or, if so\r\n  connected, not producing any modification in the tentacle), as in\r\n  Leptolinae. In Hydromedusae the sense-organs are always exposed at the\r\n  umbrellar margin (hence _Gymnophthalmata_), while in Scyphomedusae\r\n  they are covered over by flaps of the umbrellar margin (hence\r\n  _Steganophthalmata_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Modified after Linko, _Traveaux Soc.

By means of vibrations\r\n  or shocks transmitted through the water, or by displacements in the\r\n  balance or position of the animal, the otoliths are caused to impinge\r\n  against the bristles of the sensory cells, now on one side, now on the\r\n  other, causing shocks or stimuli which are transmitted by the basal\r\n  nerve-fibre to the central nervous system. Two stages in the\r\n  development of the otocyst can be recognized, the first that of an\r\n  open pit on a freely-projecting knob, in which the otoliths are\r\n  exposed, the second that of a closed vesicle, in which the otoliths\r\n  are covered over. Further, two distinct types of otocyst can be\r\n  recognized in the Hydromedusae: that of the Leptolinae, in which the\r\n  entire organ is ectodermal, concrement-cells and all, and the organ is\r\n  not a tentaculocyst; and that of the Trachylinae, in which the organ\r\n  is a tentaculocyst, and the concrement-cells are endodermal, derived\r\n  from the endoderm of the modified tentacle, while the rest of the\r\n  organ is ectodermal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Modified after O. and R, Hertwig, _Nervensystem und\r\n  Sinnesorgane der Medusen_, by permission of F.

The pit has its\r\n  opening turned towards the sub-umbral cavity, while its base or fundus\r\n  forms a bulge, more or less pronounced, on the ex-umbral side of the\r\n  velum. At the _fundus_ are placed the concrement-cells with their\r\n  conspicuous otoliths (_con_) and the inconspicuous auditory cells,\r\n  which are connected with. the sub-umbral nerve-ring. From the open\r\n  condition arises the closed condition very simply by closing up of the\r\n  aperture of the pit. We then find the typical otocyst of the\r\n  Leptomedusae, a vesicle bulging on the ex-umbral side of the velum\r\n  (figs. 32, 33). The otocysts are placed on the outer wall of the\r\n  vesicle (the fundus of the original pit) or on its sides; their\r\n  arrangement and number vary greatly and furnish useful characters for\r\n  distinguishing genera. The sense-cells are innervated, as before, from\r\n  the sub-umbral nerve-ring. The inner wall of the vesicle (region of\r\n  closure) is frequently thickened to form a so-called \"sense-cushion,\"\r\n  apparently a ganglionic offshoot from the sub-umbral nerve-ring. In\r\n  many Leptomedusae the otocysts are very small, inconspicuous and\r\n  embedded completely in the tissues; hence they may be easily\r\n  overlooked in badly-preserved material, and perhaps are present in\r\n  many cases where they have been said to have been wanting.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After O. and R, Hertwig, _Nervensystem und Sinnesorgane\r\n  der Medusen_, by permission of F.

In the endoderm large concretions are\r\n  formed (_con._). Other sensory cells with long cilia cover a sort of\r\n  cushion (_n.c._) at the base of the club; the club may be long and the\r\n  cushion small, or the cushion large and the club small. The whole\r\n  structure is innervated, like the tentacles, from the ex-umbral\r\n  nerve-ring. An advance towards the second stage is seen in such a form\r\n  as _Rhopalonema_ (fig. 36), where the ectoderm of the cushion rises up\r\n  in a double fold to enclose the club in a protective covering forming\r\n  a cup or vesicle, at first open distally; finally the opening closes\r\n  and the closed vesicle may sink inwards and be found far removed from\r\n  the surface, as in _Geryonia_ (fig. 37).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 36.--Simple tentaculocyst of _Rhopalonema\r\n  velatum_. The process carrying the otolith or concretion hk, formed by\r\n  endoderm cells, is enclosed by an upgrowth forming the \"vesicle,\"\r\n  which is not yet quite closed in at the top. (After Hertwig.)]\r\n\r\n  The _ocelli_ are seen in their simplest form as a pigmented patch of\r\n  ectoderm, which consists of two kinds of cells--(1) pigment-cells,\r\n  which are ordinary indifferent cells of the epithelium containing\r\n  pigment-granules, and (2) visual cells, slender sensory epithelial\r\n  cells of the usual type, which may develop visual cones or rods at\r\n  their free extremity. The ocelli occur usually either on the inner or\r\n  outer sides of the tentacles; if on the inner side, the tentacle is\r\n  turned upwards and carried over the ex-umbrella, so as to expose the\r\n  ocellus to the light; if the ocellus be on the outer side of a\r\n  tentacle, two nerves run round the base of the tentacle to it. In\r\n  other cases ocelli may occur between tentacles, as in _Tiaropsis_\r\n  (fig. 29).\r\n\r\n  The simple form of ocellus described in the foregoing paragraph may\r\n  become folded into a pit or cup, the interior of which becomes filled\r\n  with a clear gelatinous secretion forming a sort of vitreous body. The\r\n  distal portion of the vitreous body may project from the cavity of the\r\n  cup, forming a non-cellular lens as in _Lizzia_ (fig. 28). Beyond this\r\n  simple condition the visual organs of the Hydromedusae do not advance,\r\n  and are far from reaching the wonderful development of the eyes of\r\n  Scyphomedusae (_Charybdaea_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After O. and R, Hertwig, _Nervensystem und Sinnesorgane\r\n  der Medusen_, by permission of F.

In this case the pigment-cells are\r\n  endodermal, forming a cup of pigment in which the visual cones are\r\n  embedded. A similar ocellus is formed in _Aurelia_ among the\r\n  Scyphomedusae (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  Other sense organs of Hydromedusae are the so-called _sense-clubs_ or\r\n  _cordyli_ found in a few Leptomedusae, especially in those genera in\r\n  which otocysts are inconspicuous or absent (fig. 39). Each cordylus is\r\n  a tentacle-like structure with an endodermal axis containing an axial\r\n  cavity which may be continuous with the ring-canal, or may be\r\n  partially occluded. Externally the cordylus is covered, by very\r\n  flattened ectoderm, and bears no otoliths or sense-cells, but the base\r\n  of the club rests upon the ex-umbral nerve-ring. Brooks regards these\r\n  organs as sensory, serving for the sense of balance, and representing\r\n  a primitive stage of the tentaculocysts of Trachylinae; Linko, on the\r\n  other hand, finding no nerve-elements connected with them, regards\r\n  them as digestive (?) in function.\r\n\r\n  The sense-organs of the two fresh-water medusae _Limnocodium_ and\r\n  _Limnocnida_ are peculiar and of rather doubtful nature (see E. T.\r\n  Browne [10]).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 38.--Ocellus of _Lizzia koellikeri_. oc, Pigmented ectodermal\r\n  cells; l, lens. (After Hertwig.)\r\n\r\n  The endoderm of the medusa shows the same general types of structure\r\n  as in the polyp, described above. We can distinguish (1) digestive\r\n  endoderm, in the stomach, often with special glandular elements; (2)\r\n  circulatory endoderm, in the radial and ring-canals; (3) supporting\r\n  endoderm in the axes of the tentacles and in the endoderm-lamella; the\r\n  latter is primitively a double layer of cells, produced by\r\n  concrescence of the ex-umbral and sub-umbral layers of the\r\n  coelenteron, but it is usually found as a single layer of flattened\r\n  cells (fig. 40); in _Geryonia_, however, it remains double, and the\r\n  centripetal canals arise by parting of the two layers; (4) excretory\r\n  endoderm, lining pores at the margin of the umbrella, occurring in\r\n  certain Leptomedusae as so-called \"marginal tubercles,\" opening, on\r\n  the one hand, into the ring-canal and, on the other hand, to the\r\n  exterior by \"marginal funnels,\" which debouch into the sub-umbral\r\n  cavity above the velum. As has been described above, the endoderm may\r\n  also contribute to the sense-organs, but such contributions are always\r\n  of an accessory nature, for instance, concrement-cells in the\r\n  otocysts, pigment in the ocelli, and never of sensory nature,\r\n  sense-cells being in all cases ectodermal.\r\n\r\n  The reproductive cells may be regarded as belonging primarily to\r\n  neither ectoderm nor endoderm, though lodged in the ectoderm in all\r\n  Hydromedusae. As described for the polyp, they are wandering cells\r\n  capable of extensive migrations before reaching the particular spot at\r\n  which they ripen. In the Hydromedusae they usually, if not invariably,\r\n  ripen in the ectoderm, but in the neighbourhood of the main sources of\r\n  nutriment, that is to say, not far from the stomach. Hence the gonads\r\n  are found on the manubrium in Anthomedusae generally; on the base of\r\n  the manubrium, or under the gastral pouches, or in both these\r\n  situations (_Octorchidae_), or under the radial canals, in\r\n  Trachomedusae; under the gastral pouches or radial canals, in\r\n  Narcomedusae. When ripe, the germ-cells are dehisced directly to the\r\n  exterior.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After W. K.

Moreover,\r\n  all the medusae budded from a given hydroid colony are either male or\r\n  female, so that even the non-sexual polyp must be considered to have a\r\n  latent sex. (In _Hydra_, on the other hand, the individual is usually\r\n  hermaphrodite.) The medusa always reproduces itself sexually, and in\r\n  some cases non-sexually also. The non-sexual reproduction takes the\r\n  form of fission, budding or sporogony, the details of which are\r\n  described below. Buds may be produced from the manubrium, radial\r\n  canals, ring-canal, or tentacle-bases, or from an aboral stolon\r\n  (Narcomedusae). In all cases only medusa-buds are produced, never\r\n  polyp-buds.\r\n\r\n  The mesogloea of the medusa is largely developed and of great\r\n  thickness in the umbrella. The sub-epithelial tissues, i.e. the\r\n  nervous and muscular cells, are lodged in the mesogloea, but in\r\n  Hydromedusae it never contains tissue-cells or mesogloeal corpuscles.\r\n\r\n  (b) _The Medusae as a Subordinate Individuality._--It has been shown\r\n  above that polyps are budded only from polyps and that the medusae may\r\n  be budded either from polyps or from medusae. In any case the\r\n  daughter-individuals produced from the buds may be imagined as\r\n  remaining attached to the parent and forming a colony of individuals\r\n  in organic connexion with one another, and thus three possible cases\r\n  arise. The first case gives a colony entirely composed of polyps, as\r\n  in many Hydroidea. The second case gives a colony partly composed of\r\n  polyp-individuals, partly of medusa-individuals, a possibility also\r\n  realized in many colonies of Hydroidea. The third case gives a colony\r\n  entirely composed of medusa-individuals, a possibility perhaps\r\n  realized in the Siphonophora, which will be discussed in dealing with\r\n  this group.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Portions of Sections through the Disk of\r\n  Medusae--the upper one of _Lizzia_, the lower of _Aurelia_.

Normally the medusae are liberated in quite an\r\n  immature state; they swim away, feed, grow and become adult mature\r\n  individuals. From the bionomical point of view, the medusa is to be\r\n  considered as a means of spreading the species, supplementing the\r\n  deficiencies of the sessile polyp. It may be, however, that increased\r\n  reproductiveness becomes of greater importance to the species than\r\n  wide diffusion; such a condition will be brought about if the medusae\r\n  mature quickly and are either set free in a mature condition or remain\r\n  in the shelter of the polyp-colony, protected from risks of a free\r\n  life in the open sea. In this way the medusa sinks from an independent\r\n  personality to an organ of the polyp-colony, becoming a so-called\r\n  _medusoid gonophore_, or bearer of the reproductive organs, and losing\r\n  gradually all organs necessary for an independent existence, namely\r\n  those of sense, locomotion and nutrition.\r\n\r\n  In some cases both free medusae and gonophores may be produced from\r\n  the same hydroid colony. This is the case in _Syncoryne mirabilis_\r\n  (Allman [1], p. 278) and in _Campanularia volubilis_; in the latter,\r\n  free medusae are produced in summer, gonophores in winter (Duplessis\r\n  [14]). Again in _Pennaria_, the male medusae are set free in a state\r\n  of maturity, and have ocelli; the female medusae remain attached and\r\n  have no sense organs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Modified from Weismann, _Entstehung der Sexualzellen\r\n  bei den Hydromedusen_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 41.--Diagrams of the Structure of the Gonophores of various\r\n  Hydromedusae, based on the figures of G.

A very early stage in the degeneration is well\r\n  exemplified by the so-called \"meconidium\" of _Gonothyraea_ (fig. 41,\r\n  A). Here the medusoid, attached by the centre of its ex-umbral\r\n  surface, has lost its velum and sub-umbral muscles, its sense organs\r\n  and mouth, though still retaining rudimentary tentacles. The gonads\r\n  (g) are produced on the manubrium, which has a hollow endodermal axis,\r\n  termed the spadix (sp.), in open communication with the coenosarc of\r\n  the polyp-colony and serving for the nutrition of the generative\r\n  cells. A very similar condition is seen in _Tubularia_ (fig. 41, B),\r\n  where, however, the tentacles have quite disappeared, and the circular\r\n  rim formed by the margin of the umbrella has nearly closed over the\r\n  manubrium leaving only a small aperture through which the embryos\r\n  emerge. The next step is illustrated by the female gonophores of\r\n  _Cladocoryne_, where the radial and ring-canals have become\r\n  obliterated by coalescence of their walls, so that the entire endoderm\r\n  of the umbrella is in the condition of the endoderm-lamella. Next the\r\n  opening of the umbrella closes up completely and disappears, so that\r\n  the sub-umbral cavity forms a closed space surrounding the manubrium,\r\n  on which the gonads are developed; such a condition is seen in the\r\n  male gonophore of _Cladocoryne_ and in _Garveia_ (fig. 41, C), where,\r\n  however, there is a further complication in the form of an\r\n  adventitious envelope or ectotheca (ect.) split off from the gonophore\r\n  as a protective covering, and not present in _Cladocoryne_. The\r\n  sub-umbral cavity (s.c.) functions as a brood-space for the developing\r\n  embryos, which are set free by rupture of the wall. It is evident that\r\n  the outer envelope of the gonophore represents the ex-umbral ectoderm\r\n  (ex.), and that the inner ectoderm lining the cavity represents the\r\n  sub-umbral ectoderm of the free medusa. The next step is the gradual\r\n  obliteration of the sub-umbral cavity (s.c.) by disappearance of which\r\n  the sub-umbral ectoderm comes into contact with the ectoderm of the\r\n  manubrium. Such a type is found in _Plumularia_ and also in _Agalma_\r\n  (fig. 41, D); centrally is seen the spadix (sp.), bearing the\r\n  generative cells (g), and external to these (1) a layer of ectoderm\r\n  representing the epithelium of the manubrium; (2) the layer of\r\n  sub-umbral ectoderm; (3) the endoderm-lamella (e.l.); (4) the\r\n  ex-umbral ectoderm (ex.); and (5) there may or may not be present also\r\n  an ectotheca. Thus the gonads are covered over by at least four layers\r\n  of epithelium, and since these are unnecessary, presenting merely\r\n  obstacles to the dehiscence of the gonads, they gradually undergo\r\n  reduction. The sub-umbral ectoderm and that covering the manubrium\r\n  undergo concrescence to form a single layer (fig. 41, E), which\r\n  finally disappears altogether, and the endoderm-lamella disappears.\r\n  The gonophore is now reduced to its simplest condition, known as the\r\n  _sporosac_ (fig. 41, F, G, H), and consists of the spadix bearing the\r\n  gonads covered by a single layer of ectoderm (ex.), with or without\r\n  the addition of an ectotheca. It cannot be too strongly emphasized,\r\n  however, that the sporosac should not be compared simply with the\r\n  manubrium of the medusa, as is sometimes done. The endodermal spadix\r\n  (sp) of the sporosac represents the endoderm of the manubrium; the\r\n  ectodermal lining of the sporosac (ex.) represents the ex-umbral\r\n  ectoderm of the medusa; and the intervening layers, together with the\r\n  sub-umbral cavity, have disappeared. The spadix, as the organ of\r\n  nutrition for the gonads, may be developed in various ways, being\r\n  simple (fig. 41, F) or branched (fig. 41, H); in _Eudendrium_ (fig.\r\n  41, G) it curls round the single large ovum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Allman, _Gymnoblastic Hydroids_, by permission of\r\n  the Council of the Ray Society.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 42.--Gonophores of _Dicoryne conferta_.\r\n\r\n    A, A male gonophore still enclosed in its ectotheca.\r\n    B and C, Two views of a female gonophore after liberation.\r\n    t, Tentacles.\r\n    ov, Ova, two carried on each female gonophore.\r\n    sp, Testis.]\r\n\r\n  The hydroid _Dicoryne_ is remarkable for the possession of gonophores,\r\n  which are ciliate and become detached and swim away by means of their\r\n  cilia. Each such sporosac has two long tentacle-like processes thickly\r\n  ciliated.\r\n\r\n  It has been maintained that the gonads of _Hydra_ represent sporosacs\r\n  or gonophores greatly reduced, with the last traces of medusoid\r\n  structure completely obliterated. There is, however, no evidence\r\n  whatever for this, the gonads of _Hydra_ being purely ectodermal\r\n  structures, while all medusoid gonophores have an endodermal portion.\r\n  _Hydra_ is, moreover, bisexual, in contrast with what is known of\r\n  hydroid colonies.\r\n\r\n  In some Leptomedusae the gonads are formed on the radial canals and\r\n  form protruding masses resembling sporosacs superficially, but not in\r\n  structure. Allman, however, regarded this type of gonad as equivalent\r\n  to a sporosac, and considered the medusa bearing them as a non-sexual\r\n  organism, a \"blastocheme\" as he termed it, producing by budding\r\n  medusoid gonophores. As medusae are known to bud medusae from the\r\n  radial canals there is nothing impossible in Allman's theory, but it\r\n  cannot be said to have received satisfactory proof.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reproduction and Ontogeny of the Hydromedusae._\r\n\r\nNearly every possible method of reproduction occurs amongst the\r\nHydromedusae. In classifying methods of generation it is usual to make\r\nuse of the sexual or non-sexual nature of the reproduction as a primary\r\ndifference, but a more scientific classification is afforded by the\r\ndistinction between tissue-cells (histocytes) and germinal cells, actual\r\nor potential (archaeocytes), amongst the constituent cells of the animal\r\nbody. In this way we may distinguish, first, _vegetative_ reproduction,\r\nthe result of discontinuous growth of the tissues and cell-layers of the\r\nbody as a whole, leading to (1) _fission_, (2) _autotomy_, or (3)\r\n_vegetative budding_; secondly, _germinal_ reproduction, the result of\r\nthe reproductive activity of the archaeocytes or germinal tissue. In\r\ngerminal reproduction the proliferating cells may be _undifferentiated_,\r\nso-called primitive germ-cells, or they may be _differentiated_ as\r\nsexual cells, male or female, i.e. spermatozoa and ova. If the\r\ngerm-cells are _undifferentiated_, the offspring may arise from many\r\ncells or from a single cell; the first type is (4) _germinal budding_,\r\nthe second is (5) _sporogony_. If the germ-cells are _differentiated_,\r\nthe offspring arises by _syngamy_ or sexual union of the ordinary type\r\nbetween an ovum and spermatozoon, so-called fertilization, of the ovum,\r\nor by _parthenogenesis_, i.e. development of an ovum without\r\nfertilization. The only one of these possible modes of reproduction not\r\nknown to occur in Hydromedusae is parthenogenesis.\r\n\r\n(1) True _fission_ or longitudinal division of an individual into two\r\nequal and similar daughter-individuals is not common but occurs in\r\n_Gastroblasta_, where it has been described in detail by Arnold Lang\r\n[30].\r\n\r\n(2) _Autotomy_, sometimes termed transverse fission, is the name given\r\nto a process of unequal fission in which a portion of the body separates\r\noff with subsequent regeneration. In _Tubularia_ by a process of\r\ndecapitation the hydranths may separate off and give rise to a separate\r\nindividual, while the remainder of the body grows a new hydranth.\r\nSimilarly in _Schizocladium_ portions of the hydrocaulus are cut off to\r\nform so-called \"spores,\" which grow into new individuals (see Allman\r\n[1]).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Much modified from C. Chun, \"Coelenterata,\" in Bronn's\r\n_Tierreich_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 43.--Direct Budding of _Cunina_.\r\n\r\n    A, B, C, E, F, In vertical section.\r\n    D, Sketch of external view.\r\n    st, Stomach.\r\n    m, Manubrium.\r\n    t.

By\r\nbudding is understood the formation of a new individual from a fresh\r\ngrowth of undifferentiated material. It is convenient to distinguish\r\nbuds that give rise to polyps from those that form medusae.\r\n\r\n  (a) _The Polyp._--The buds that form polyps are very simple in mode of\r\n  formation. Four stages may be distinguished; the first is a simple\r\n  outgrowth of both layers, ectoderm and endoderm, containing a\r\n  prolongation of the coelenteric cavity; in the second stage the\r\n  tentacles grow out as secondary diverticula from the side of the first\r\n  outgrowth; in the third stage the mouth is formed as a perforation of\r\n  the two layers; and, lastly, if the bud is to be separated, it becomes\r\n  nipped off from the parent polyp and begins a free existence.\r\n\r\n  (b) _The Medusae._--Two types of budding must be distinguished--the\r\n  direct, so-called, palingenetic type, and the _indirect_, so-called\r\n  coenogenetic type.\r\n\r\n  The direct type of budding is rare, but is seen in _Cunina_ and\r\n  _Millepora_. In _Cunina_ there arises, first, a simple outgrowth of\r\n  both layers, as in a polyp-bud (fig. 43, A); in this the mouth is\r\n  formed distally as a perforation (B); next the sides of the tube so\r\n  formed bulge out laterally near the attachment to form the umbrella,\r\n  while the distal undilated portion of the tube represents the\r\n  manubrium (C); the umbrella now grows out into a number of lobes or\r\n  lappets, and the tentacles and tentaculocysts grow out, the former in\r\n  a notch between two lappets, the latter on the apex of each lappet (D,\r\n  E); finally, the velum arises as a growth of the ectoderm alone, the\r\n  whole bud shapes itself, so to speak, and the little medusa is\r\n  separated off by rupture of the thin stalk connecting it with the\r\n  parent (F). The direct method of medusa-budding only differs from the\r\n  polyp-bud by its greater complexity of parts and organs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Diagrams of Medusa budding with the formation\r\n  of an entocodon.

It is marked by the formation in the bud\r\n  of a characteristic structure termed the _entocodon_ (_Knospenkern_,\r\n  _Glockenkern_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 45.--Modifications of the method of budding shown\r\n  in fig. 44, with solid Entocodon (Gc.) and formation of an ectotheca\r\n  (ect.).]\r\n\r\n  The first stage is a simple hollow outgrowth of both body-layers (fig.\r\n  44, A); at the tip of this is formed a thickening of the ectoderm,\r\n  arising primitively as a hollow ingrowth (fig. 44, B), but more\r\n  usually as a solid mass of ectoderm-cells (fig. 45, A). The ectodermal\r\n  ingrowth is the entocodon (Gc.); it bulges into, and pushes down, the\r\n  endoderm at the apex of the bud, and if solid it soon acquires a\r\n  cavity (fig. 44, C, s.c.). The cavity of the entocodon increases\r\n  continually in size, while the endoderm pushes up at the sides of it\r\n  to form a cup with hollow walls, enclosing but not quite surrounding\r\n  the entocodon, which remains in contact at its outer side with the\r\n  ectoderm covering the bud (fig. 44, D, v). The next changes that take\r\n  place are chiefly in the endoderm-cup (fig. 44, D, E); the cavity\r\n  between the two walls of the cup becomes reduced by concrescence to\r\n  form the radial canals (r.c.), ring-canal (c.c.), and endoderm-lamella\r\n  (e.l., fig. 44, E), and at the same time the base of the cup is thrust\r\n  upwards to form the manubrium (m), converting the cavity of the\r\n  entocodon into a space which is crescentic or horse-shoe-like in\r\n  section. Next tentacles (t, fig. 44, F) grow out from the ring-canal,\r\n  and the double plate of ectoderm on the distal side of the entocodon\r\n  becomes perforated, leaving a circular rim composed of two layers of\r\n  ectoderm, the velum (v) of the medusa. Finally, a mouth is formed by\r\n  breaking through at the apex of the manubrium, and the now\r\n  fully-formed medusa becomes separated by rupture of the stalk of the\r\n  bud and swims away.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 46.--Diagrams to show the significance of the\r\n  Entocodon in Medusa-buds. (Modified from a diagram given by A.\r\n  Weismann.)\r\n\r\n    I, Ideally primitive method of budding, in which the mouth is formed\r\n      first (Ia), next the tentacles (Ib), and lastly the umbrella.\r\n    II, Method. of _Cunina_; (a) the mouth arises, next the umbrella\r\n      (b), and lastly the tentacles (c).\r\n    III, Hypothetical transition from II to the indirect method with an\r\n      entocodon; the formation of the manubrium is retarded, that of the\r\n      umbrella hastened (IIIa, b).\r\n    IV, a, b, c, budding with an entocodon (cf. fig. 44).\r\n    V, Budding with a solid entocodon (cf. fig. 45).]\r\n\r\n  If the bud, however, is destined to give rise not to a free medusa,\r\n  but to a gonophore, the development is similar but becomes arrested at\r\n  various points, according to the degree to which the gonophore is\r\n  degenerate. The entocodon is usually formed, proving the medusoid\r\n  nature of the bud, but in sporosacs the entocodon may be rudimentary\r\n  or absent altogether. The process of budding as above described may be\r\n  varied or complicated in various ways; thus a secondary, amnion-like,\r\n  ectodermal covering or ectotheca (fig. 45, C, ect.) may be formed over\r\n  all, as in _Garveia_, &c.; or the entocodon may remain solid and\r\n  without cavity until after the formation of the manubrium, or may\r\n  never acquire a cavity at all, as described above for the gonophores.\r\n\r\n  _Phylogenetic Significance of the Entocodon._--It is seen from the\r\n  foregoing account of medusa-budding that the entocodon is a very\r\n  important constituent of the bud, furnishing some of the most\r\n  essential portions of the medusa; its cavity becomes the sub-umbral\r\n  cavity, and its lining furnishes the ectodermal epithelium of the\r\n  manubrium and of the sub-umbral cavity as far as the edge of the\r\n  velum. Hence the entocodon represents a precocious formation of the\r\n  sub-umbral surface, equivalent to the peristome of the polyp,\r\n  differentiated in the bud prior to other portions of the organism\r\n  which must be regarded as antecedent to it in phylogeny.\r\n\r\n  If the three principal organ-systems of the medusa, namely mouth,\r\n  tentacles and umbrella, be considered in the light of phylogeny, it is\r\n  evident that the manubrium bearing the mouth must be the oldest, as\r\n  representing a common property of all the Coelentera, even of the\r\n  gastrula embryo of all Enterozoa. Next in order come the tentacles,\r\n  common to all Cnidaria. The special property of the medusa is the\r\n  umbrella, distinguishing the medusa at once from other morphological\r\n  types among the Coelentera. If, therefore, the formation of these\r\n  three systems of organs took place according to a strictly\r\n  phylogenetic sequence, we should expect them to appear in the order\r\n  set forth above (fig. 46, Ia, b, c). The nearest approach to the\r\n  phylogenetic sequence is seen in the budding of _Cunina_, where the\r\n  manubrium and mouth appear first, but the umbrella is formed before\r\n  the tentacles (fig. 46, IIa, b, c). In the indirect or coenogenetic\r\n  method of budding, the first two members of the sequence exhibited by\r\n  Cunina change places, and the umbrella is formed first, the manubrium\r\n  next, and then the tentacles; the actual mouth-perforation being\r\n  delayed to the very last (fig. 46, IVa, b, c). Hence the budding of\r\n  medusae exemplifies very clearly a common phenomenon in development, a\r\n  phylogenetic series of events completely dislocated in the ontogenetic\r\n  time-sequence.\r\n\r\n  The entocodon is to be regarded, therefore, not as primarily an\r\n  ingrowth of ectoderm, but rather as an upgrowth of both body-layers,\r\n  in the form of a circular rim (IVa), representing the umbrellar\r\n  margin; it is comparable to the bulging that forms the umbrella in the\r\n  direct method of budding, but takes place before a manubrium is\r\n  formed, and is greatly reduced in size, so as to become a little pit.\r\n  By a simple modification, the open pit becomes a solid ectodermal\r\n  ingrowth, just as in Teleostean fishes the hollow medullary tube, or\r\n  the auditory pit of other vertebrate embryos, is formed at first as a\r\n  solid cord of cells, which acquires a cavity secondarily. Moreover,\r\n  the entocodon, however developed, gives rise at first to a closed\r\n  cavity, representing a closing over of the umbrella, temporary in the\r\n  bud destined to be a free medusa, but usually permanent in the sessile\r\n  gonophore. As has been shown above, the closing up of the sub-umbral\r\n  cavity is one of the earliest degenerative changes in the evolution of\r\n  the gonophore, and we may regard it as the umbrellar fold taking on a\r\n  protective function, either temporarily for the bud or permanently for\r\n  the gonophore.\r\n\r\n  To sum up, the entocodon is a precocious formation of the umbrella,\r\n  closing over to protect the organs in the umbrellar cavity. The\r\n  possession of an entocodon proves the medusa-nature of the bud, and\r\n  can only be explained on the theory that gonophores are degenerate\r\n  medusae, and is inexplicable on the opposed view that medusae are\r\n  derived from gonophores secondarily set free. In the sporosac,\r\n  however, the medusa-individual has become so degenerate that even the\r\n  documentary proof, so to speak, of its medusoid nature may have been\r\n  destroyed, and only circumstantial evidence of its nature can be\r\n  produced.\r\n\r\n4. _Germinal Budding._--This method of budding is commonly described as\r\nbudding from a single body-layer, instead of from both layers. The layer\r\nthat produces the bud is invariably the ectoderm, i.e. the layer in\r\nwhich, in Hydromedusae, the generative cells are lodged; and in some\r\ncases the buds are produced in the exact spot in which later the gonads\r\nappear. From these facts, and from those of the sporogony, to be\r\ndescribed below, we may regard budding to this type as taking place from\r\nthe germinal epithelium rather than from ordinary ectoderm.\r\n\r\n  (a) _The Polyp._--Budding from the ectoderm alone has been described\r\n  by A. Lang [29] in _Hydra_ and other polyps. The tissues of the bud\r\n  become differentiated into ectoderm and endoderm, and the endoderm of\r\n  the bud becomes secondarily continuous with that of the parent, but no\r\n  part of the parental endoderm contributes to the building up of the\r\n  daughter-polyp. Lang regarded this method of budding as universal in\r\n  polyps, a notion disproved by O. Seeliger [52] who went to the\r\n  opposite extreme and regarded the type of budding described by Lang as\r\n  non-existent. In view, however, both of the statements and figures of\r\n  Lang and of the facts to be described presently for medusae\r\n  (_Margellium_), it is at least theoretically possible that both\r\n  germinal and vegetative budding may occur in polyps as well as in\r\n  medusae.\r\n\r\n  (b) _The Medusa._--The clearest instance of germinal budding is\r\n  furnished by _Margellium (Rathkea) octopunctatum_, one of the\r\n  _Margelidae_. The budding of this medusa has been worked out in detail\r\n  by Chun (HYDROZOA, [1]), to whom the reader must be referred for the\r\n  interesting laws of budding regulating the sequence and order of\r\n  formation of the buds.\r\n\r\n  The buds of _Margellium_ are produced on the manubrium in each of the\r\n  four interradii, and they arise from the ectoderm, that is to say, the\r\n  germinal epithelium, which later gives rise to the gonads. The buds do\r\n  not appear simultaneously but successively on each of the four sides\r\n  of the manubrium, thus:\r\n\r\n       1\r\n    3     4\r\n       2\r\n\r\n  and secondary buds may be produced on the medusa-buds before the\r\n  latter are set free as medusae. Each bud arises as a thickening of the\r\n  epithelium, which first forms two or three layers (fig. 47, A), and\r\n  becomes separated into a superficial layer, future ectoderm,\r\n  surrounding a central mass, future endoderm (fig. 47, B). The\r\n  ectodermal epithelium on the distal side of the bud becomes thickened,\r\n  grows inwards, and forms a typical entocodon (fig. 37, D, E, F). The\r\n  remaining development of the bud is just as described above for the\r\n  indirect method of medusa-budding (fig. 47, G, H). When the bud is\r\n  nearly complete, the body-wall of the parent immediately below it\r\n  becomes perforated, placing the coelenteric cavity of the parent in\r\n  secondary communication with that of the bud (H), doubtless for the\r\n  better nutrition of the latter.\r\n\r\n  Especially noteworthy in the germinal budding of _Margellium_ is the\r\n  formation of the entocodon, as in the vegetative budding of the\r\n  indirect type.\r\n\r\n5. _Sporogony._--This method of reproduction has been described by E.\r\nMetchnikoff in _Cunina_ and allied genera. In individuals either of the\r\nmale or female sex, germ-cells which are quite undifferentiated and\r\nneutral in character, become amoeboid, and wander into the endoderm.\r\nThey divide each into two sister-cells, one of which--the spore--becomes\r\nenveloped by the other. The spore-cell multiplies by division, while the\r\nenveloping cell is nutrient and protective. The spore cell gives rise to\r\na \"spore-larva,\" which is set free in the coelenteron and grows into a\r\nmedusa. Whether sporogony occurs also in the polyp or not remains to be\r\nproved.\r\n\r\n6. _Sexual Reproduction and Embryology._--The ovum of Hydromedusae is\r\nusually one of a large number of oögonia, and grows at the expense of\r\nits sister-cells. No regular follicle is formed, but the oöcyte absorbs\r\nnutriment from the remaining oögonia. In _Hydra_ the oöcyte is a large\r\namoeboid cell, which sends out pseudopodia amongst the oögonia and\r\nabsorbs nutriment from them. When the oöcyte is full grown, the residual\r\noögonia die off and disintegrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Budding from the Ectoderm (germinal epithelium)\r\nin _Margellium_. (After C.

We may distinguish the following series of stages: (1) ovum;\r\n  (2) cleavage, leading to formation of a blastula; (3) formation of an\r\n  inner mass or parenchyma, the future endoderm, by immigration or\r\n  delamination, leading to the so-called parenchymula-stage; (4)\r\n  formation of an archenteric cavity, the future coelenteron, by a\r\n  splitting of the internal parenchyma, and of a blastopore, the future\r\n  mouth, by perforation at one pole, leading to the gastrula-stage; (5)\r\n  the outgrowth of tentacles round the mouth (blastopore), leading to\r\n  the actinula-stage; and (6) the actinula becomes the polyp or medusa\r\n  in the manner described elsewhere (see articles HYDROZOA, POLYP and\r\n  MEDUSA). This is the full, ideal development, which is always\r\n  contracted or shortened to a greater or less extent. If the embryo is\r\n  set free as a free-swimming, so-called planula-larva, in the blastula,\r\n  parenchymula, or gastrula stage, then a free actinula stage is not\r\n  found; if, on the other hand, a free actinula occurs, then there is no\r\n  free planula stage.\r\n\r\n  The cleavage of the ovum follows two types, both seen in _Tubularia_\r\n  (Brauer [3]). In the first, a cleavage follows each nuclear division;\r\n  in the second, the nuclei multiply by division a number of times, and\r\n  then the ovum divides into as many blastomeres as there are nuclei\r\n  present. The result of cleavage in all cases is a typical blastula,\r\n  which when set free becomes oval and develops a flagellum to each\r\n  cell, but when not set free, it remains spherical in form and has no\r\n  flagella.\r\n\r\n  The germ-layer formation is always by immigration or delamination,\r\n  never by invagination. When the blastula is oval and free-swimming the\r\n  inner mass is formed by unipolar immigration from the hinder pole.\r\n  When the blastula is spherical and not set free, the germ-layer\r\n  formation is always multipolar, either by immigration or by\r\n  delamination, i.e. by tangential division of the cells of the\r\n  blastoderm, as in _Geryonia_, or by a mixture of immigration and\r\n  delamination, as in _Hydra_, _Tubularia_, &c. The blastopore is formed\r\n  as a secondary perforation at one spot, in free-swimming forms at the\r\n  hinder pole. Formation of archenteron and blastopore may, however, be\r\n  deferred till a later stage (actinula or after).\r\n\r\n  The actinula stage is usually suppressed or not set free, but it is\r\n  seen in _Tubularia_ (fig. 48), where it is ambulatory, in _Gonionemus_\r\n  (Trachomedusae), and in _Cunina_ (Narcomedusae), where it is\r\n  parasitic.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Modified from a plate by L. Agassiz, _Contributions to\r\n  Nat. Hist. U.S._, iv.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 48.--Free Actinula of _Tubularia_.]\r\n\r\n  In Leptolinae the embryonic development culminates in a polyp, which\r\n  is usually formed by fixation of a planula (parenchymula), rarely by\r\n  fixation of an actinula. The planula may fix itself (1) by one end,\r\n  and then becomes the hydrocaulus and hydranth, while the hydrorhiza\r\n  grows out from the base; or (2) partly by one side and then gives rise\r\n  to the hydrorhiza as well as to the other parts of the polyp; or (3)\r\n  entirely by its side, and then forms a recumbent hydrorhiza from which\r\n  a polyp appears to be budded as an upgrowth.\r\n\r\n  In Trachylinae the development produces always a medusa, and there is\r\n  no polyp-stage. The medusa arises direct from the actinula-stage and\r\n  there is no entocodon formed, as in the budding described above.\r\n\r\n  _Life-cycles of the Hydromedusae._--The life-cycle of the Leptolinae\r\n  consists of an alternation of generations in which non-sexual\r\n  individuals, polyps, produce by budding sexual individuals, medusae,\r\n  which give rise by the sexual process to the non-sexual polyps again,\r\n  so completing the cycle. Hence the alternation is of the type termed\r\n  metagenesis. The Leptolinae are chiefly forms belonging to the inshore\r\n  fauna. The Trachylinae, on the other hand, are above all oceanic\r\n  forms, and have no polyp-stage, and hence there is typically no\r\n  alternation in their life-cycle. It is commonly assumed that the\r\n  Trachylinae are forms which have lost the alternation of generations\r\n  possessed by them ancestrally, through secondary simplification of the\r\n  life-cycle. Hence the Trachylinae are termed \"hypogenetic\" medusae to\r\n  contrast them with the metagenetic Leptolinae. The whole question has,\r\n  however, been argued at length by W. K. Brooks [4], who adduces strong\r\n  evidence for a contrary view, that is to say, for regarding the direct\r\n  type of development seen in Trachylinae as more primitive, and the\r\n  metagenesis seen in Leptolinae as a secondary complication introduced\r\n  into the life-cycle by the acquisition of _larval budding_. The polyp\r\n  is regarded, on this view, as a form phylogenetically older than the\r\n  medusa, in short, as nothing more than a sessile actinula. In\r\n  Trachylinae the polyp-stage is passed over, and is represented only by\r\n  the actinula as a transitory embryonic stage. In Leptolinae the\r\n  actinula becomes the sessile polyp which has acquired the power of\r\n  budding and producing individuals either of its own or of a higher\r\n  rank; it represents a persistent larval stage and remains in a\r\n  sexually immature condition as a neutral individual, sex being an\r\n  attribute only of the final stage in the development, namely the\r\n  medusa. The polyp of the Leptolinae has reached the limit of its\r\n  individual development and is incapable of becoming itself a medusa,\r\n  but only produces medusa-buds; hence a true alternation of generations\r\n  is produced. In Trachylinae also the beginnings of a similar\r\n  metagenesis can be found. Thus in _Cunina octonaria_, the ovum\r\n  develops into an actinula which buds daughter-actinulae; all of them,\r\n  both parent and offspring, develop into medusae, so that there is no\r\n  alternation of generations, but only larval multiplication. In _Cunina\r\n  parasitica_, however, the ovum develops into an actinula, which buds\r\n  actinulae as before, but only the daughter-actinulae develop into\r\n  medusae, while the original, parent-actinula dies off; here,\r\n  therefore, larval budding has led to a true alternation of\r\n  generations. In _Gonionemus_ the actinula becomes fixed and\r\n  polyp-like, and reproduces by budding, so that here also an\r\n  alternation of generations may occur. In the Leptolinae we must first\r\n  substitute polyp for actinula, and then a condition is found which can\r\n  be compared to the case of _Cunina parasitica_ or Gonionemus, if we\r\n  suppose that neither the parent-actinula (i.e. founder-polyp) nor its\r\n  offspring by budding (polyps of the colony) have the power of becoming\r\n  medusae, but only of producing medusae by budding. For further\r\n  arguments and illustrations the reader must be referred to Brooks's\r\n  most interesting memoir. The whole theory is one most intimately\r\n  connected with the question of the relation between polyp and medusa,\r\n  to be discussed presently. It will be seen elsewhere, however, that\r\n  whatever view may be held as to the origin of metagenesis in\r\n  Hydromedusae, in the case of Scyphomedusae (q.v.) no other view is\r\n  possible than that the alternation of generations is the direct result\r\n  of larval proliferation.\r\n\r\n  To complete our survey of life-cycles in the Hydromedusae it is\r\n  necessary to add a few words about the position of _Hydra_ and its\r\n  allies. If we accept the view that _Hydra_ is a true sexual polyp, and\r\n  that its gonads are not gonophores (i.e. medusa-buds) in the extreme\r\n  of degeneration, then it follows from Brooks's theory that _Hydra_\r\n  must be descended from an archaic form in which the medusan type of\r\n  organization had not yet been evolved. _Hydra_ must, in short, be a\r\n  living representative of the ancestor of which the actinula-stage is a\r\n  transient reminiscence in the development of higher forms. It may be\r\n  pointed out in this connexion that the fixation of _Hydra_ is only\r\n  temporary, and that the animal is able at all times to detach itself,\r\n  to move to a new situation, and to fix itself again. There is no\r\n  difficulty whatever in regarding _Hydra_ as bearing the same relation\r\n  to the actinula-stage of other Hydromedusae that a Rotifer bears to a\r\n  trochophore-larva or a fish to a tadpole.\r\n\r\n_The Relation of Polyp and Medusa._--Many views have been put forward as\r\nto the morphological relationship between the two types of person in the\r\nHydromedusae. For the most part, polyp and medusa have been regarded as\r\nmodifications of a common type, a view supported by the existence, among\r\nScyphomedusae (q.v.), of sessile polyp-like medusae (_Lucernaria_, &c.).\r\nR. Leuckart in 1848 compared medusae in general terms to flattened\r\npolyps. G. J. Allman [1] put forward a more detailed view, which was as\r\nfollows. In some polyps the tentacles are webbed at the base, and it was\r\nsupposed that a medusa was a polyp of this kind set free, the umbrella\r\nbeing a greatly developed web or membrane extending between the\r\ntentacles. A very different theory was enunciated by E. Metchnikoff. In\r\nsome hydroids the founder-polyp, developed from a planula after\r\nfixation, throws out numerous outgrowths from the base to form the\r\nhydrorhiza; these outgrowths may be radially arranged so as to form by\r\ncontact or coalescence a flat plate. Mechnikov considered the plate thus\r\nformed at the base of the polyp as equivalent to the umbrella, and the\r\nbody of the polyp as equivalent to the manubrium, of the medusa; on this\r\nview the marginal tentacles almost invariably present in medusae are new\r\nformations, and the tentacles of the polyp are represented in the medusa\r\nby the oral arms which may occur round the mouth, and which sometimes,\r\ne.g. in _Margelidae_, have the appearance and structure of tentacles.\r\nApart from the weighty arguments which the development furnishes against\r\nthe theories of Allman and Mechnikov, it may be pointed out that neither\r\nhypothesis gives a satisfactory explanation of a structure universally\r\npresent in medusae of whatever class, namely the endoderm-lamella,\r\ndiscovered by the brothers O. and R. Hertwig. It would be necessary to\r\nregard this structure as a secondary extension of the endoderm in the\r\ntentacle-web, on Allman's theory, or between the outgrowths of the\r\nhydrorhiza, on Mechnikov's hypothesis. The development, on the contrary,\r\nshows unequivocally that the endoderm-lamella arises as a local\r\ncoalescence of the endodermal linings of a primitively extensive gastral\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThe question is one intimately connected with the view taken as to the\r\nnature and individuality of polyp, medusa and gonophore respectively. On\r\nthis point the following theories have been put forward.\r\n\r\n  1. The theory that the medusa is simply an organ, which has become\r\n  detached and has acquired a certain degree of independence, like the\r\n  well-known instance of the hectocotyle of the cuttle-fish. On this\r\n  view, put forward by E. van Beneden and T. H. Huxley, the sporosac is\r\n  the starting-point of an evolution leading up through the various\r\n  types of gonophores to the free medusa as the culminating point of a\r\n  phyletic series. The evidence against this view may be classed under\r\n  two heads: first, comparative evidence; hydroids very different in\r\n  their structural characters and widely separate in the systematic\r\n  classification of these organisms may produce medusae very similar, at\r\n  least so far as the essential features of medusan organization are\r\n  concerned; on the other hydroids closely allied, perhaps almost\r\n  indistinguishable, may produce gonophores in the one case, medusae in\r\n  the other; for example, _Hydractinia_ (gonophores) and _Podocoryne_\r\n  (medusae), _Tubularia_ (gonophores) and _Ectopleura_ (medusae),\r\n  _Coryne_ (gonophores) and _Syncoryne_ (medusae), and so on. If it is\r\n  assumed that all these genera bore gonophores ancestrally, then medusa\r\n  of similar type must have been evolved quite independently in a great\r\n  number of cases. Secondly, there is the evidence from the development,\r\n  namely, the presence of the entocodon in the medusa-bud, a structure\r\n  which, as explained above, can only be accounted for satisfactorily by\r\n  derivation from a medusan type of organization. Hence it may be\r\n  concluded that the gonophores are degenerate medusae, and not that the\r\n  medusae are highly elaborated gonophores, as the organ-theory\r\n  requires.\r\n\r\n  2. The theory that the medusa is an independent individual, fully\r\n  equivalent to the polyp in this respect, is now universally accepted\r\n  as being supported by all the facts of comparative morphology and\r\n  development. The question still remains open, however, which of the\r\n  two types of person may be regarded as the most primitive, the most\r\n  ancient in the race-history of the Hydromedusae. F. M. Balfour put\r\n  forward the view that the polyp was the more primitive type, and that\r\n  the medusa is a special modification of the polyp for reproductive\r\n  purposes, the result of division of labour in a polyp-colony, whereby\r\n  special reproductive persons become detached and acquire organs of\r\n  locomotion for spreading the species. W. K. Brooks, on the other hand,\r\n  as stated above, regards the medusa as the older type and looks upon\r\n  both polyp and medusa, in the Hydromedusae, as derived from a\r\n  free-swimming or floating actinula, the polyp being thus merely a\r\n  fixed nutritive stage, possessing secondarily acquired powers of\r\n  multiplication by budding.\r\n\r\n  The Hertwigs when they discovered the endoderm-lamella showed on\r\n  morphological grounds that polyp and medusa are independent types,\r\n  each produced by modification in different directions of a more\r\n  primitive type represented in development by the actinula-stage. If a\r\n  polyp, such as _Hydra_, be regarded simply as a sessile actinula, we\r\n  must certainly consider the polyp to be the older type, and it may be\r\n  pointed out that in the Anthozoa only polyp-individuals occur. This\r\n  must not be taken to mean, however, that the medusa is derived from a\r\n  sessile polyp; it must be regarded as a direct modification of the\r\n  more ancient free actinula form, without primitively any intervening\r\n  polyp-stage, such as has been introduced secondarily into the\r\n  development of the Leptolinae and represents a revival, so to speak,\r\n  of an ancestral form or larval stage, which has taken on a special\r\n  role in the economy of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE HYDROMEDUSAE\r\n\r\nORDER I. Eleutheroblastea.--Simple polyps which become sexually mature\r\nand which also reproduce non-sexually, but without any medusoid stage in\r\nthe life-cycle.\r\n\r\nThe sub-order includes the family _Hydridae_, containing the common\r\nfresh-water polyps of the genus _Hydra_. Certain other forms of doubtful\r\naffinities have also been referred provisionally to this section.\r\n\r\n  _Hydra._--This genus comprises fresh-water polyps of simple structure.\r\n  The body bears tentacles, but shows no division into hydrorhiza,\r\n  hydrocaulus or hydranth; it is temporarily fixed and has no perisarc.\r\n  The polyp is usually hermaphrodite, developing both ovaries and testes\r\n  in the same individual. There is no free-swimming planula larva, but\r\n  the stage corresponding to it is passed over in an enveloping cyst,\r\n  which is secreted round the embryo by its own ectodermal layer,\r\n  shortly after the germ-layer formation is complete, i.e. in the\r\n  parenchymula-stage. The envelope is double, consisting of an external\r\n  chitinous stratified shell, and an internal thin elastic membrane.\r\n  Protected by the double envelope, the embryo is set free as a\r\n  so-called \"egg,\" and in Europe it passes the winter in this condition.\r\n  In the spring the embryo bursts its shell and is set free as a minute\r\n  actinula which becomes a _Hydra_.\r\n\r\n  Many species are known, of which three are common in European waters.\r\n  It has been shown by C. F. Jickeli (28) that the species are\r\n  distinguishable by the characters of their nematocysts. They also show\r\n  characteristic differences in the egg (Brauer [2]). In _Hydra viridis_\r\n  the polyp is of a green colour and produces a spherical egg with a\r\n  smooth shell which is dropped into the mud. _H. grisea_ is greyish in\r\n  tint and produces a spherical egg with a spiky shell, which also is\r\n  dropped into the mud. _H. fusca_ (= _H. vulgaris_) is brown in colour,\r\n  and produces a bun-shaped egg, spiky on the convex surface, and\r\n  attached to a water-weed or some object by its flattened side. Brauer\r\n  found a fourth species, similar in appearance to _H. fusca_, but\r\n  differing from the three other species in being of separate sexes, and\r\n  in producing a spherical egg with a knobby shell, which is attached\r\n  like that of _H. fusca_.\r\n\r\n  The fact already noted that the species of _Hydra_ can be\r\n  distinguished by the characters of their nematocysts is a point of\r\n  great interest. In each species, two or three kinds of nematocysts\r\n  occur, some large, some small, and for specific identification the\r\n  nematocysts must be studied collectively in each species. It is very\r\n  remarkable that this method of characterizing and diagnozing species\r\n  has never been extended to the marine hydroids. It is quite possible\r\n  that the characters of the nematocysts might afford data as useful to\r\n  the systematist in this group as do the spicules of sponges, for\r\n  instance. It would be particularly interesting to ascertain how the\r\n  nematocysts of a polyp are related to those possessed by the medusa\r\n  budded from it, and it is possible that in this manner obscure\r\n  questions of relationship might be cleared up.\r\n\r\n  _Protohydra_ is a marine genus characterized by the absence of\r\n  tentacles, by a great similarity to _Hydra_ in histological structure,\r\n  and by reproduction by transverse fission. It was found originally in\r\n  an oyster-farm at Ostend. The sexual reproduction is unknown. For\r\n  further information see C. Chun (HYDROZOA [1]. Pl. I.).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Diagram showing possible modifications of\r\n  persons of a gymnoblastic _Hydromedusa_.

A \"stolon\" of unknown origin produces thirty-two\r\n  buds, which become as many _Polypodia_; each has twenty-four tentacles\r\n  and divides by fission repeated twice into four individuals, each with\r\n  six tentacles. The daughter-individuals grow, form the full number of\r\n  twenty-four tentacles and divide again. The polyps are free and walk\r\n  on their tentacles. See Ussow [54].\r\n\r\n  _Tetraplatia volitans_ Viguier is a remarkable floating marine form.\r\n  See C. Viguier [56] and Delage and Hérouard (Hydrozoa [2]).\r\n\r\n  _Haleremita_ Schaudinn. See F. Schaudinn [50] and Delage and Hérouard\r\n  (HYDROZOA [2]).\r\n\r\n  In all the above-mentioned genera, with the exception of _Hydra_, the\r\n  life-cycle is so imperfectly known that their true position cannot be\r\n  determined in the present state of our knowledge. They may prove\r\n  eventually to belong to other orders. Hence only the genus _Hydra_ can\r\n  be considered as truly representing the order Eleutheroblastea. The\r\n  phylogenetic position of this genus has been discussed above.\r\n\r\nORDER II. Hydroidea seu Leptolinae.--Hydromedusae with alternation of\r\ngenerations (metagenesis) in which a non-sexual polyp-generation\r\n(trophosome) produces by budding a sexual medusa-generation (gonosome).\r\nThe polyp may be solitary, but more usually produces polyps by budding\r\nand forms a polyp-colony. The polyp usually has the body distinctly\r\ndivisible into hydranth, hydrocaulus and hydrorhiza, and is usually\r\nclothed in a perisarc. The medusae may be set free or may remain\r\nattached to the polyp-colony and degenerate into a gonophore. When fully\r\ndeveloped the medusa is characterized by the sense organs being composed\r\nentirely of ectoderm, developed independently of the tentacles, and\r\ninnervated from the sub-umbral nerve-ring.\r\n\r\n  The two kinds of persons present in the typical Hydroidea make the\r\n  classification of the group extremely difficult, for reasons explained\r\n  above. Hence the systematic arrangement that follows must be\r\n  considered purely provisional. A natural classification of the\r\n  Hydroidea has yet to be put forward. Many genera and families are\r\n  separated by purely artificial characters, mere shelf-and-bottle\r\n  groupings devised, for the convenience of the museum curator and the\r\n  collector. Thus many subdivisions are diagnosed by setting free\r\n  medusae in one case, or producing gonophores in another, although it\r\n  is very obvious, as pointed out above, that a genus producing medusae\r\n  may be far more closely allied to one producing gonophores than to\r\n  another producing medusae, or vice versa, and that in some cases the\r\n  production of medusae or gonophores varies with the season or the sex.\r\n  Moreover, P. Hallez [22] has recently shown that hydroids hitherto\r\n  regarded as distinct species are only forms of the same species grown\r\n  under different conditions.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 1. HYDROIDEA GYMNOBLASTEA (ANTHOMEDUSAE).--Trophosome without\r\nhydrothecae or gonothecae, with monopodial type of budding. Gonosome\r\nwith free medusae or gonophores; medusae usually with ocelli, never with\r\notocysts. The gymnoblastic polyp usually has a distinct perisarc\r\ninvesting the hydrorhiza and the hydrocaulus, sometimes also the\r\nhydranth as far as the bases of the tentacles (_Bimeria_); but in such\r\ncases the perisarc forms a closely-fitting investment or cuticule on the\r\nhydranth, never a hydrotheca standing off from it, as in the next\r\nsub-order. The polyps may be solitary, or form colonies, which may be of\r\nthe spreading or encrusting type, or arborescent, and then always of\r\nmonopodial growth and budding. In some cases, any polyp of the colony\r\nmay bud medusae; in other cases, only certain polyps, the blastostyles,\r\nhave this power. When blastostyles are present, however, they are never\r\nenclosed in special gonothecae as in the next sub-order. In this\r\nsub-order the characters of the hydranth are very variable, probably\r\nowing to the fact that it is exposed and not protected by a hydrotheca,\r\nas in Calyptoblastea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--_Sarsia (Dipurena) gemnifera._ b, The long\r\nmanubrium, bearing medusiform buds; a, mouth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--_Sarsia prolifera._ Ocelli are seen at the base\r\nof the tentacles, and also (as an exception) groups of medusiform buds.]\r\n\r\n  Speaking generally, three principal types of hydranth can be\r\n  distinguished, each with subordinate varieties of form.\r\n\r\n  1. Club-shaped hydranths with numerous tentacles, generally scattered\r\n  irregularly, sometimes with a spiral arrangement, or in whorls\r\n  (\"verticillate\").\r\n\r\n  (a) Tentacles filiform; type of _Clava_ (fig. 5), _Cordylophora_,\r\n    &c.\r\n\r\n  (b) Tentacles capitate, simple; type of _Coryne_ and _Syncoryne_;\r\n    _Myriothela_ is an aberrant form with some of the tentacles modified\r\n    as \"claspers\" to hold the ova.\r\n\r\n  (c) Tentacles capitate, branched, wholly or in part; type of\r\n    _Cladocoryne_.\r\n\r\n  (d) Tentacles filiform or capitate, tending to be arranged in\r\n    definite whorls; type of _Stauridium_ (fig. 2), _Cladonema_ and\r\n    _Pennaria_.\r\n\r\n  2. Hydranth more shortened, daisy-like in form, with two whorls of\r\n  tentacles, oral and aboral.\r\n\r\n  (a) Tentacles filiform, simple, radially arranged or scattered\r\n    irregularly; type of _Tubularia_ (fig. 4), _Corymorpha_ (fig. 3),\r\n    _Nemopsis_, _Pelagohydra_, &c.\r\n\r\n  (b) Tentacles with a bilateral arrangement, branched tentacles in\r\n    addition to simple filiform ones; type of _Branchiocerianthus_.\r\n\r\n  3. Hydranth with a single circlet of tentacles.\r\n\r\n  (a) With filiform tentacles; the commonest type, seen in\r\n    _Bougainvillea_ (fig. 13), _Eudendrium_, &c.\r\n\r\n  (b) With capitate tentacles; type of _Clavatella_.\r\n\r\n  4. Hydranth with tentacles reduced below four; type of _Lar_ (fig.\r\n  11), _Monobrachium_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe _Anthomedusa_ in form is generally deep, bell-shaped. The sense\r\norgans are typically ocelli, never otocysts. The gonads are borne on the\r\nmanubrium, either forming a continuous ring (Codonid type), or four\r\nmasses or pairs of masses (Oceanid type). The tentacles may be scattered\r\nsingly round the margin of the umbrella (\"monerenematous\") or arranged\r\nin tufts (\"lophonematous\"); in form they may be simple or branched\r\n(Cladonemid type); in structure they may be hollow (\"coelomerinthous\");\r\nor solid (\"pycnomerinthous\"). When sessile gonophores are produced, they\r\nmay show all stages of degeneration.\r\n\r\n  _Classification._--Until quite recently the hydroids (Gymnoblastea)\r\n  and the medusae (Anthomedusae) have been classified separately, since\r\n  the connexion between them was insufficiently known. Delage and\r\n  Hérouard (HYDROZOA [2]) were the first to make an heroic attempt to\r\n  unite the two classifications into one, to which Hickson (HYDROZOA\r\n  [4]) has made some additions and slight modifications. The\r\n  classification given here is for the most part that of Delage and\r\n  Hérouard. It is certain, however, that no such classification can be\r\n  considered final at present, but must undergo continual revision in\r\n  the future. With this reservation we may recognize fifteen\r\n  well-characterized families and others of more doubtful nature.\r\n  Certain discrepancies must also be noted.\r\n\r\n  1. _Margelidae_ (= medusa-family _Margelidae_ + hydroid families\r\n  _Bougainvillidae_, _Dicorynidae_, _Bimeridae_ and _Eudendridae_).\r\n  Trophosome arborescent, with hydranths of _Bougainvillea_-type;\r\n  gonosome free medusae or gonophores, the medusae with solid tentacles\r\n  in tufts (lophonematous). Common genera are the hydroid\r\n  _Bougainvillea_ (figs. 12, 13), and the medusae _Hippocrene_ (budded\r\n  from _Bougainvillea_), _Margelis_, _Rathkea_ (fig. 24), and\r\n  _Margellium_. Other hydroids are _Garveia_, _Bimeria_, _Eudendrium_\r\n  and _Heterocordyle_, with gonophores, and _Dicoryne_ with peculiar\r\n  sporosacs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Haeckel, _System der Medusen_, by permission of\r\n  Gustav Fischer.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 52.--_Tiara pileata_, L. Agassiz.]\r\n\r\n  2. _Podocorynidae_ (= medusa-families _Thamnostomidae_ and _Cytaeidae_\r\n  + hydroid families _Podocorynidae_ and _Hydractiniidae_). Trophosome\r\n  encrusting with hydranths of _Bougainvillea_-type, polyps\r\n  differentiated into blastostyles, gastrozoids and dactylozoids;\r\n  gonosome free medusae or gonophores. The typical genus is the\r\n  well-known hydroid _Podocoryne_, budding the medusa known as\r\n  _Dysmorphosa_; _Thamnostylus_, _Cytaeis_, &c., are other medusae with\r\n  unknown hydroids. _Hydractinia_ (figs. 9, 10) is a familiar hydroid\r\n  genus, bearing gonophores.\r\n\r\n  3. _Cladonemidae_.--Trophosome, polyps with two whorls of tentacles,\r\n  the lower filiform, the upper capitate; gonosome, free medusae, with\r\n  tentacles solid and branched. The type-genus _Cladonema_ (fig. 20) is\r\n  a common British form.\r\n\r\n  4. _Clavatellidae._--Trophosome, polyps with a single whorl of\r\n  capitate tentacles; gonosome, free medusae, with tentacles branched,\r\n  solid. _Clavatella_ (fig. 21), with a peculiar ambulatory medusa is a\r\n  British form.\r\n\r\n  5. _Pennariidae_.--Trophosome, polyps with an upper circlet of\r\n  numerous capitate tentacles, and a lower circlet of filiform\r\n  tentacles. _Pennaria_, with a free medusa known as _Globiceps_, is a\r\n  common Mediterranean form. _Stauridium_ (fig. 2) is a British hydroid.\r\n\r\n  6. _Tubulariidae._--Trophosome, polyps with two whorls of tentacles,\r\n  both filiform. _Tubularia_ (fig. 4), a well-known British hydroid,\r\n  bears gonophores.\r\n\r\n  7. _Corymorphidae_ (including the medusa-family\r\n  _Hybocodonidae_).--Trophosome solitary polyps, with two whorls of\r\n  tentacles; gonosome, free medusae or gonophores. _Corymorpha_ (fig.\r\n  3), a well-known British genus, sets free a medusa known as\r\n  _Steenstrupia_ (fig. 22). Here belong the deep-sea genera _Monocaulus_\r\n  and _Branchiocerianthus_, including the largest hydroid polyps known,\r\n  both genera producing sessile gonophores.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Haeckel, _System der Medusen_, by permission of\r\n  Gustav Fischer.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 53.--_Pteronema darwinii_. The apex of the stomach is prolonged\r\n  into a brood pouch containing embryos.]\r\n\r\n  8. _Dendroclavidae._--Trophosome, polyp with filiform tentacles in\r\n  three or four whorls. _Dendroclava_, a hydroid, produces the medusa\r\n  known as _Turritopsis_.\r\n\r\n  9. _Clavidae_ (including the medusa-family _Tiaridae_ (figs. 27 and\r\n  51). Trophosome, polyps with scattered filiform tentacles; gonosome,\r\n  medusae or gonophores, the medusae with hollow tentacles. _Clava_\r\n  (fig. 5), a common British hydroid, produces gonophores; so also does\r\n  _Cordylophora_, a form inhabiting fresh or brackish water. _Turris_\r\n  produces free medusae. _Amphinema_ is a medusan genus of unknown\r\n  hydroid.\r\n\r\n  10. _Bythotiaridae._--Trophosome unknown; gonosome, free medusae, with\r\n  deep, bell-shaped umbrella, with interradial gonads on the base of the\r\n  stomach, with branched radial canals, and correspondingly numerous\r\n  hollow tentacles. _Bythotiara_, _Sibogita_.\r\n\r\n  11. _Corynidae_ (= hydroid families _Corynidae_, _Syncorynidae_ and\r\n  _Cladocorynidae_ + medusan family _Sarsiidae_).--Trophosome polyps\r\n  with capitate tentacles, simple or branched, scattered or\r\n  verticillate; gonosome, free medusae or gonophores. _Coryne_, a common\r\n  British hydroid, produces gonophores; _Syncoryne_, indistinguishable\r\n  from it, produces medusae known as _Sarsia_ (fig. 51). _Cladocoryne_\r\n  is another hydroid genus; _Codonium_ and _Dipurena_ (fig. 50) are\r\n  medusan genera.\r\n\r\n  12. _Myriothelidae._--The genus _Myriothela_ is a solitary polyp with\r\n  scattered capitate tentacles, producing sporosacs.\r\n\r\n  13. _Hydrolaridae._--Trophosome (only known in one genus), polyps with\r\n  two tentacles forming a creeping colony; gonosome, free medusae with\r\n  four, six or more radial canals, giving off one or more lateral\r\n  branches which run to the margin of the umbrella, with the stomach\r\n  produced into four, six or more lobes, upon which the gonads are\r\n  developed; the mouth with four lips or with a folded margin; the\r\n  tentacles simple, arranged evenly round the margin of the umbrella.\r\n  The remarkable hydroid _Lar_ (fig. 11) grows upon the tubes of the\r\n  worm _Sabella_ and produces a medusa known as _Willia_. Another\r\n  medusan genus is _Proboscidactyla_.\r\n\r\n  14. _Monobrachiidae._--The genus _Monobrachium_ is a colony-forming\r\n  hydroid which grows upon the shells of bivalve molluscs, each polyp\r\n  having but a single tentacle. It buds medusae, which, however, are as\r\n  yet only known in an immature condition (C. Mereschkowsky [41]).\r\n\r\n  15. _Ceratellidae._--Trophosome polyps forming branching colonies of\r\n  which the stem and main branches are thick and composed of a network\r\n  of anastomosing coenosarcal tubes covered by a common ectoderm and\r\n  supported by a thick chitinous perisarc; hydranths similar to those of\r\n  _Coryne_; gonosome, sessile gonophores. _Ceratella_, an exotic genus\r\n  from the coast of East Africa, New South Wales and Japan. The genera\r\n  _Dehitella_ Gray and _Dendrocoryne_ Inaba should perhaps be referred\r\n  to this family; the last-named is regarded by S. Goto [16] as the type\r\n  of a distinct family, _Dendrocorynidae_.\r\n\r\n  Doubtful families, or forms difficult to classify, are: Pteronemidae,\r\n  Medusae of Cladonemid type, with hydroids for the most part unknown.\r\n  The British genus _Gemmaria_, however, is budded from a hydroid\r\n  referable to the family _Corynidae_. _Pteronema_ (fig. 53).\r\n\r\n  _Nemopsidae_, for the floating polyp _Nemopsis_, very similar to\r\n  _Tubularia_ in character; the medusa, on the other hand, is very\r\n  similar to _Hippocrene_ (_Margelidae_). See C. Chun (HYDROZOA [1]).\r\n\r\n  _Pelagohydridae_, for the floating polyp _Pelagohydra_, Dendy, from\r\n  New Zealand. The animal is a solitary polyp bearing a great number of\r\n  medusa-buds. The body, representing the hydranth of an ordinary\r\n  hydroid, has the aboral portion modified into a float, from which\r\n  hangs down a proboscis bearing the mouth. The float is covered with\r\n  long tentacles and bears the medusa-buds. The proboscis bears at its\r\n  extremity a circlet of smaller oral tentacles. Thus the affinities of\r\n  the hydranth are clearly, as Dendy points out, with a form such as\r\n  _Corymorpha_, which also is not fixed but only rooted in the mud. The\r\n  medusae, on the other hand, have the tentacles in four tufts of (in\r\n  the buds) five each, and thus resemble the medusae of the family\r\n  _Margelidae_. See A. Dendy [12].\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Fig. 54._--Diagram showing possible modifications of\r\n  the persons of a Calyptoblastic Hydromedusa.

(After Allman.)]\r\n\r\n  _Perigonimus._--This common British hydroid belongs by its characters\r\n  to the family _Bougainvillidae_; it produces, however, a medusa of the\r\n  genus _Tiara_ (fig. 52), referable to the family _Clavidae_; a fact\r\n  sufficient to indicate the tentative character of even the most modern\r\n  classifications of this order.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER II. HYDROIDEA CALYPTOBLASTEA (LEPTOMEDUSAE).--Trophosome with\r\npolyps always differentiated into nutritive and reproductive individuals\r\n(blastostyles) enclosed in hydrothecae and gonothecae respectively; with\r\nsympodial type of budding. Gonosome with free medusae or gonophores; the\r\nmedusae typically with otocysts, sometimes with cordyli or ocelli (figs.\r\n54, 55).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--View of the Oral Surface of one of the\r\n_Leptomedusae_ (_Irene pellucida_, Haeckel), to show the numerous\r\ntentacles and the otocysts.\r\n\r\n  ge, Genital glands.\r\n  M, Manubrium.\r\n  ot, Otocysts.\r\n  rc, The four radiating canals.\r\n  Ve, The velum.]\r\n\r\nThe calyptoblastic polyp of the nutritive type is very uniform in\r\ncharacter, its tendency to variation being limited, as it were, by the\r\nenclosing hydrotheca. The hydranth almost always has a single circlet of\r\ntentacles, like the _Bougainvillea_-type, in the preceding sub-order; an\r\nexception is the curious genus _Clathrozoon_, in which the hydranth has\r\na single tentacle. The characteristic hydrotheca is formed by the bud at\r\nan early stage (fig. 56); when complete it is an open cup, in which the\r\nhydranth develops and can be protruded from the opening for the capture\r\nof food, or is withdrawn into it for protection. Solitary polyps are\r\nunknown in this sub-order; the colony may be creeping or arborescent in\r\nform; if the latter, the budding of the polyps, as already stated, is of\r\nthe sympodial type, and either biserial, forming stems capable of\r\nfurther branching, or uniserial, forming pinnules not capable of further\r\nbranching. In the biserial type the polyps on the two sides of the stem\r\nhave primitively an alternating, zigzag arrangement; but, by a process\r\nof differential growth, quickened in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, &c., members of\r\nthe stem, and retarded in the 2nd, 4th, 6th, &c., members, the polyps\r\nmay assume secondarily positions opposite to one another on the two\r\nsides of the stem. Other variations in the mode of growth or budding\r\nbring about further differences in the building up of the colony, which\r\nare not in all cases properly understood and cannot be described in\r\ndetail here. The stem may contain a single coenosarcal tube\r\n(\"monosiphonic\") or several united in a common perisarc\r\n(\"polysiphonic\"). An important variation is seen, in the form of the\r\nhydrotheca itself, which may come off from the main stem by a stalk, as\r\nin _Obelia_, or may be sessile, without a stalk, as in _Sertularia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After Allman, _Gymnoblastic Hydroids_, by permission of\r\nthe council of the Ray Society.\r\n\r\nFIG. 56.--Diagrams to show the mode of formation of the Hydrotheca and\r\nGonotheca in Calyptoblastic Hydroids. A-D are stages common to both;\r\nfrom D arises the hydrotheca (E) or the gonotheca (F); th, theca; st,\r\nstomach; t, tentacles; m, mouth; mb, medusa-buds.]\r\n\r\nIn many Calyptoblastea there occur also reduced defensive polyps or\r\ndactylozoids, which in this sub-order have received the special name of\r\n_sarcostyles_. Such are the \"snake-like zoids\" of _Ophiodes_ and other\r\ngenera, and as such are generally interpreted the \"machopolyps\" of the\r\n_Plumularidea_. These organs are supported by cuplike structures of the\r\nperisarc, termed nematophores, regarded as modified hydrothecae\r\nsupporting the specialized polyp-individuals. They are specially\r\ncharacteristic of the family _Plumularidae_.\r\n\r\nThe medusa-buds, as already stated, are always produced from\r\nblastostyles, reduced non-nutritive polyps without mouth or tentacles.\r\nAn apparent, but not real, exception is _Halecium halecinum_, in which\r\nthe blastostyle is produced from the side of a nutritive polyp, and both\r\nare enclosed in a common theca without a partition between them (Allman\r\n[1] p. 50, fig. 24). The gonotheca is formed in its early stage in the\r\nsame way as the hydrotheca, but the remains of the hydranth persists as\r\nan operculum closing the capsule, to be withdrawn when the medusae or\r\ngenital products are set free (fig. 56).\r\n\r\n  The blastostyles, gonophores and gonothecae furnish a series of\r\n  variations which can best be considered as so many stages of\r\n  evolution.\r\n\r\n  Stage 1, seen in _Obelia_. Numerous medusae are budded successively\r\n  within the gonotheca and set free; they swim off and mature in the\r\n  open sea (Allman [1], p. 48, figs. 18, 19).\r\n\r\n  Stage 2, seen in _Gonothyraea_. Medusae, so-called \"meconidia,\" are\r\n  budded but not liberated; each in turn, when it reaches sexual\r\n  maturity, is protruded from the gonotheca by elongation of the stalk,\r\n  and sets free the embryos, after which it withers and is replaced by\r\n  another (Allman [1], p. 57, fig. 28).\r\n\r\n  Stage 3, seen in _Sertularia_.--The gonophores are reduced in varying\r\n  degree, it may be to sporosacs; they are budded successively from the\r\n  blastostyle, and each in turn, when ripe, protrudes the spadix through\r\n  the gonotheca (fig. 57, A, B). The spadix forms a gelatinous cyst, the\r\n  so-called acrocyst (ac), external to the gonotheca (gth), enclosing\r\n  and protecting the embryos. Then the spadix withers, leaving the\r\n  embryos in the acrocyst, which may be further protected by a so-called\r\n  marsupium, a structure formed by tentacle-like processes growing out\r\n  from the blastostyle to enclose the acrocyst, each such process being\r\n  covered by perisarc like a glove-finger secreted by it (fig. 57, C).\r\n  (Allman [1], pp. 50, 51, figs. 21-24; Weismann [58], p. 170, pl. ix.,\r\n  figs. 7, 8.)\r\n\r\n  Stage 4, seen in _Plumularidae_.--The generative elements are produced\r\n  in structures termed corbulae, formed by reduction and modification of\r\n  branches of the colony. Each corbula contains a central row of\r\n  blastostyles enclosed and protected by lateral rows of branches\r\n  representing stunted buds (Allman [1], p. 66, fig. 30).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After Allman, _Gymnoblastic Hydroids_, by permission of\r\nthe council of the Ray Society.\r\n\r\nFig. 57.--Diagrams to show the mode of formation of an Acrocyst and a\r\nMarsupium. In A two medusa-buds are seen within the gonotheca (gth), the\r\nupper more advanced than the lower one. In B the spadix of the upper bud\r\nhas protruded itself through the top of the gonotheca and the acrocyst\r\n(ac) is secreted round it. In C the marsupium (m) is formed as\r\nfinger-like process from the summit of the blastostyle, enclosing the\r\nacrocyst; b, medusa-buds on the blastostyle.]\r\n\r\nThe _Leptomedusa_ in form is generally shallow, more or less\r\nsaucer-like, with velum less developed than in Anthomedusae (fig. 55).\r\nThe characteristic sense-organs are ectodermal otocysts, absent,\r\nhowever, in some genera, in which case cordyli may replace them. When\r\notocysts are present, they are at least eight in number, situated\r\nadradially, but are often very numerous. The cordyli are scattered on\r\nthe ring-canal. Ocelli, if present, are borne on the tentacle-bulbs. The\r\ntentacles are usually hollow, rarely solid (_Obelia_). In number they\r\nare rarely less than four, but in _Dissonema_ there are only two.\r\nPrimitively there are four perradial tentacles, to which may be added\r\nfour interradial, or they may become very numerous and are then\r\nscattered evenly round the margin, never arranged in tufts or clusters.\r\nIn addition to tentacles, there may be marginal cirri (_Laodice_) with a\r\nsolid endodermal axis, spirally coiled, very contractile, and bearing a\r\nterminal battery of nematocysts. The gonads are developed typically\r\nbeneath the radial canals or below the stomach or its pouches, often\r\nstretching as long bands on to the base of the manubrium. In\r\n_Octorchidae_ (fig. 58) each such band is interrupted, forming one mass\r\nat the base of the manubrium and another below the radial canal in each\r\nradius, in all eight separate gonad-masses, as the name implies. In some\r\nLeptomedusae excretory \"marginal tubercles\" are developed on the\r\nring-canal.\r\n\r\n  _Classification._---As in the Gymnoblastea, the difficulty of uniting\r\n  the hydroid and medusan systems into one scheme of classification is\r\n  very great in the present state of our knowledge. In a great many\r\n  Leptomedusae the hydroid stage is as yet unknown, and it is by no\r\n  means certain even that they possess one. It is quite possible that\r\n  some of these medusae will be found to be truly hypogenetic, that is\r\n  to say, with a life-cycle secondarily simplified by suppression of\r\n  metagenesis. At present, ten recent and one extinct family of\r\n  Calyptoblastea (Leptomedusae) may be recognized provisionally:\r\n\r\n  1. _Eucopidae_ (figs. 55, 59).--Trophosome with stalked hydrothecae;\r\n  gonosome, free medusae with otocysts and four, rarely six or eight,\r\n  unbranched radial canals. Two of the commonest British hydroids belong\r\n  to this family, _Obelia_ and _Clytia_. _Obelia_ forms numerous\r\n  polyserial stems of the characteristic zigzag pattern growing up from\r\n  a creeping basal stolon, and buds the medusa of the same name. In\r\n  _Clytia_ the polyps arise singly from the stolon, and the medusa is\r\n  known as _Phialidium_ (fig. 59).\r\n\r\n  2. _Aequoridae._--Trophosome only known in one genus (_Polycanna_),\r\n  and similar to the preceding; gonosome, free medusae with otocysts and\r\n  with at least eight radial canals, often a hundred or more, simple or\r\n  branched. _Aequorea_ is a common medusa.\r\n\r\n  3. _Thaumantidae._--Trophosome only known in one genus\r\n  (_Thaumantias_), similar to that of the _Eucopidae_; gonosome, free\r\n  medusae with otocysts inconspicuous or absent, with usually four,\r\n  sometimes eight, rarely more than eight, radial canals, simple and\r\n  unbranched, along which the gonads are developed, with numerous\r\n  tentacles bearing ocelli and with marginal sense-clubs. _Laodice_ and\r\n  _Thaumantias_ are representative genera.\r\n\r\n  4. _Berenicidae._--Trophosome unknown; gonosome, free medusae, with\r\n  four or six radial canals, bearing the gonads, with numerous\r\n  tentacles, between which occur sense-clubs, without otocysts.\r\n  _Berenice_, _Staurodiscus_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Haeckel, _System der Medusen_, by permission of\r\n  Gustav Fischer.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58.--_Octorchandra canariensis_, from life.]\r\n\r\n  5. _Polyorchidae._--Trophosome unknown; gonosome, free medusae of deep\r\n  form, with radial canals branched in a feathery manner, and bearing\r\n  gonads on the main canal, but not on the branches, with numerous\r\n  hollow tentacles bearing ocelli, and without otocysts. _Polyorchis_,\r\n  _Spirocodon_.\r\n\r\n  6. _Campanularidae.-_-Trophosome as in _Eucopidae_; gonosome, sessile\r\n  gonophores. Many common or well-known genera belong here, such as\r\n  _Halecium_, _Campanularia_, _Gonothyraea_, &c.\r\n\r\n  7. _Lafoëidae._--Trophosome as in the preceding; gonosome, free\r\n  medusae or gonophores, the medusae with large open otocysts. The\r\n  hydroid genus _Lafoëa_ is remarkable for producing gonothecae on the\r\n  hydrorhiza, each containing a blastostyle which bears a single\r\n  gonophore; this portion of the colony was formerly regarded as an\r\n  independent parasitic hydroid, and was named _Coppinia_. Medusan\r\n  genera are _Mitrocoma_, _Halopsis_, _Tiaropsis_ (fig. 29, &c.).\r\n\r\n  (So far as the characters of the trophosome are concerned, the seven\r\n  preceding families are scarcely distinguishable, and they form a\r\n  section apart, contrasting sharply with the families next to be\r\n  mentioned, in none of which are free medusae liberated from the\r\n  colony, so that only the characters of the trophosome need be\r\n  considered.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After E. T. Browne, _Proc. Zool. Soc. of London_, 1896.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 59.--Three stages in the development of _Phialidium temporarium_.\r\n  a, The youngest stage, is magnified about 22 diam.; b, older, is\r\n  magnified about 8 diam.; c, the adult medusa, is magnified.]\r\n\r\n  8. _Sertularidae._--Hydrothecae sessile, biserial, alternating or\r\n  opposite on the stem. _Sertularia_ and _Sertularella_ are two very\r\n  common genera of this family.\r\n\r\n  9. _Plumularidae._--Hydrothecae sessile, biserial on the main stem,\r\n  uniserial on the lateral branches or pinnules, which give the colony\r\n  its characteristic feathery form; with nematophores. A very abundant\r\n  and prolific family; well-known British genera are _Plumularia_,\r\n  _Antennularia_ and _Aglaophenia_.\r\n\r\n  10. _Hydroceratinidae_.--This family contains the single Australian\r\n  species _Clathrozoon wilsoni_ Spencer, in which a massive hydrorhiza\r\n  bears sessile hydrothecae, containing hydranths each with a single\r\n  tentacle, and numerous nematophores. See W. B. Spencer [53].\r\n\r\n  11. _Dendrograptidae_, containing fossil (Silurian) genera, such as\r\n  _Dendrograptus_ and _Thamnograptus_, of doubtful affinities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Portion of the calcareous corallum of\r\n_Millepora nodosa_, showing the cyclical arrangement of the pores\r\noccupied by the \"persons\" or hydranths. About twice the natural size.\r\n(From Moseley.)]\r\n\r\nORDER III. Hydrocorallinae.--Metagenetic colony-forming Hydromedusae, in\r\nwhich the polyp-colony forms a massive, calcareous _corallum_ into which\r\nthe polyps can be retracted; polyp-individuals always of two kinds,\r\ngastrozoids and dactylozoids; gonosome either free medusae or sessile\r\ngonophores. The trophosome consists of a mass of coenosarcal tubes\r\nanastomosing in all planes. The interspaces between the tubes are filled\r\nup by a solid mass of lime, consisting chiefly of calcium carbonate,\r\nwhich replaces the chitinous perisarc of ordinary hydroids and forms a\r\nstony corallum or _coenosteum_ (fig. 60). The surface of the coenosteum\r\nis covered by a layer of common ectoderm, containing large nematocysts,\r\nand is perforated by pores of two kinds, gastropores and dactylopores,\r\ngiving exit to gastrozoids and dactylozoids respectively, which are\r\nlodged in vertical pore-canals of wider calibre than the coenosarcal\r\ncanals of the general network. The coenosteum increases in size by new\r\ngrowth at the surface; and in the deeper, older portions of massive\r\nforms the tissues die off after a certain time, only the superficial\r\nregion retaining its vitality down to a certain depth. The living\r\ntissues at the surface are cut off from the underlying dead portions by\r\nhorizontal partitions termed _tabulae_, which are formed successively as\r\nthe coenosteum increases in age and size. If the coenosteum of\r\n_Millepora_ be broken across, each pore-canal (perhaps better termed a\r\npolyp-canal) is seen to be interrupted by a series of transverse\r\npartitions, representing successive periods of growth with separation\r\nfrom the underlying dead portions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Enlarged view of the surface of a living\r\n_Millepora_, showing five dactylozooids surrounding a central\r\ngastrozooid. (From Moseley.)]\r\n\r\nBesides the wider vertical pore-canals and the narrower, irregular\r\ncoenosarcal canals, the coenosteum may contain, in its superficial\r\nportion, chambers or _ampullae_, in which the reproductive zoids\r\n(medusae or gonophores) are budded from the coenosarc.\r\n\r\nThe gastropores and dactylopores are arranged in various ways at the\r\nsurface, a common pattern being the formation of a cyclosystem (fig.\r\n60), in which a central gastrozoid is surrounded by a ring of\r\ndactylozoids (fig. 61). In such a system the dactylopores may be\r\nconfluent with the gastropore, so that the entire cyclosystem presents\r\nitself as a single aperture subdivided by radiating partitions, thus\r\nhaving a superficial resemblance to a madreporarian coral with its\r\nradiating septa (figs. 62 and 63).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--Diagrams illustrating the successive stages in\r\nthe development of the cyclosystems of the _Stylasteridae_.

The\r\ndactylozoids have no mouth; in _Milleporidae_ they have short capitate\r\ntentacles, but lack tentacles in _Stylasteridae_.\r\n\r\nThe gonosome consists of free medusae in _Milleporidae_, which are\r\nbudded from the apex of a dactylozoid in _Millepora murrayi_, but in\r\nother species from the coenosarcal canals. The medusae are produced by\r\ndirect budding, without an entocodon in the bud. They are liberated in a\r\nmature condition, and probably live but a short time, merely sufficient\r\nto spread the species. The manubrium bearing the gonads is mouthless,\r\nand the umbrella is without tentacles, sense-organs, velum or radial\r\ncanals. In the _Stylasteridae_ sessile gonophores are formed, always by\r\nbudding from the coenosarc. In _Distichopora_ the gonophores have radial\r\ncanals, but in other genera they are sporosacs with no trace of medusoid\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Portion of the corallum of _Astylus subviridis_\r\n(one of the Stylasteridae), showing cyclosystems placed at intervals on\r\nthe branches, each with a central gastropore and zone of slit-like\r\ndactylopores. (After Moseley.)]\r\n\r\n  _Classification._---Two families are known:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Milleporidae._--Coenosteum massive, irregular in form; pores\r\n  scattered irregularly or in cyclosystems, without styles, with\r\n  transverse tabulae; free medusae. A single genus, _Millepora_ (figs.\r\n  60, 61).\r\n\r\n  2. _Stylasteridae._--Coenosteum arborescent, sometimes fanlike, with\r\n  pores only on one face, or on the lateral margins of the branches;\r\n  gastropores with tabulae only in two genera, but with (except in\r\n  _Astylus_) a _style_, i.e. a conical, thorn-like projection from the\r\n  base of the pore, sometimes found also in dactylopores; sessile\r\n  gonophores. _Sporadopora_ has the pores scattered irregularly.\r\n  _Distichopora_ has the pores arranged in rows. _Stylaster_ has\r\n  cyclosystems. In _Allopora_ the cyclostems resemble the calyces of\r\n  Anthozoan corals. In _Cryptohelia_ the cyclosystem is covered by a cap\r\n  or operculum. In _Astylus_ (fig. 63) styles are absent.\r\n\r\n  _Affinities of the Hydrocorallinae._--There can be no doubt that the\r\n  forms comprised in this order bear a close relationship to the\r\n  Hydroidea, especially the sub-order Gymnoblastea, with which they\r\n  should perhaps be classed in a natural classification. A\r\n  hydrocoralline may be regarded as a form of hydroid colony in which\r\n  the coenosarc forms a felt-work ramifying in all planes, and in which\r\n  the chitinous perisarc is replaced by a massive calcareous skeleton.\r\n  So far as the trophosome is concerned, the step from an encrusting\r\n  hydroid such as _Hydractinia_ to the hydrocoralline _Millepora_ is not\r\n  great.\r\n\r\n  Hickson considers that the families _Milleporidae_ and _Stylasteridae_\r\n  should stand quite apart from one another and should not be united in\r\n  one order. The nearest approach to the _Stylasteridae_ is perhaps to\r\n  be found in _Ceratella_, with its arborescent trophosome formed of\r\n  anastomosing coenosarcal tubes supported by a thick perisarc and\r\n  covered by a common ectoderm. _Ceratella_ stands in much the same\r\n  relation to the _Stylasteridae_ that _Hydractinia_ does to the\r\n  _Milleporidae_, in both cases the chitinous perisarc being replaced by\r\n  the solid coenosteum to which the hydrocorallines owe the second half\r\n  of their name.\r\n\r\nORDER IV. Graptolitoidea (Rhabdophora, Allman).--This order has been\r\nconstituted for a peculiar group of palaeozoic fossils, which have been\r\ninterpreted as the remains of the skeletons of Hydrozoa of an extinct\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nA typical graptolite consists of an axis bearing a series of tooth-like\r\nprojections, like a saw. Each such projection is regarded as\r\nrepresenting a cup or hydrotheca, similar to those borne by a\r\ncalyptoblastic hydroid, such as _Sertularia_. The supposed hydrothecae\r\nmay be present on one side of the axis only (monoprionid) or on both\r\nsides (diprionid); the first case may be conjectured to be the result of\r\nuniserial (helicoid) budding, the second to be produced by biserial\r\n(scorpioid) budding. In one division (_Retiolitidae_) the axis is\r\nreticulate. In addition to the stems bearing cups, there are found\r\nvesicles associated with them, which have been interpreted as gonothecae\r\nor as floats, that is to say, air-bladders, acting as hydrostatic organs\r\nfor a floating polyp-colony.\r\n\r\nSince no graptolites are known living, or, indeed, since palaeozoic\r\ntimes, the interpretation of their structure and affinities must of\r\nnecessity be extremely conjectural, and it is by no means certain that\r\nthey are Hydrozoa at all. It can only be said that their organization,\r\nso far as the state of their preservation permits it to be ascertained,\r\noffers closer analogies with the Hydrozoa, especially the\r\nCalyptoblastea, than with any other existing group of the animal\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n  See the treatise of Delage and Hérouard (HYDROZOA, [4]), and the\r\n  article GRAPTOLITES.\r\n\r\nORDER V. Trachylinea.--Hydromedusae without alternation of generations,\r\ni.e. without a hydroid phase; the medusa develops directly from the\r\nactinula larva, which may, however, multiply by budding. Medusae with\r\nsense-organs represented by otocysts derived from modified tentacles\r\n(tentaculocysts), containing otoliths of endodermal origin, and\r\ninnervated from the ex-umbral nerve-ring.\r\n\r\nThis order, containing the typical oceanic medusae, is divided into two\r\nsub-orders.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 1. TRACHOMEDUSAE.--Tentacles given off from the margin of the\r\numbrella, which is entire, i.e. not lobed or indented; tentaculocysts\r\nusually enclosed in vesicles; gonads on the radial canals. The medusae\r\nof this order are characterized by the tough, rigid consistence of the\r\numbrella, due partly to the dense nature of the mesogloea, partly to the\r\npresence of a marginal rim of chondral tissue, consisting of thickened\r\nectoderm containing great numbers of nematocysts, and forming, as it\r\nwere, a cushion-tyre supporting the edge of the umbrella. Prolongations\r\nfrom the rim of chondral tissue may form clasps or _peronia_ supporting\r\nthe tentacles. The tentacles are primarily four in number, perradial,\r\nalternating with four interradial tentaculocysts, but both tentacles and\r\nsense-organs may be multiplied and the primary perradii may be six\r\ninstead of four (fig. 26). The tentacles are always solid, containing an\r\naxis of endoderm-cells resembling notochordal tissue or\r\nplant-parenchyma, and are but moderately flexible. The sense-organs are\r\ntentaculocysts which are usually enclosed in vesicles and may be sunk\r\nfar below the surface. The gonads are on the radial canals or on the\r\nstomach (_Ptychogastridae_), and each gonad may be divided into two by a\r\nlongitudinal sub-umbral muscle-tract. The radial canals are four, six,\r\neight or more, and in some genera blindly-ending centripetal canals are\r\npresent (fig. 26). The stomach may be drawn out into the manubrium,\r\nforming a proboscis (\"Magenstiel\") of considerable length.\r\n\r\nThe development of the Trachomedusae, so far as it is known, shows an\r\nactinula-stage which is either free (larval) or passed over in the egg\r\n(foetal) as in _Geryonia_; in no case does there appear to be a free\r\nplanula-stage. The actinula, when free, may multiply by larval budding,\r\nbut in all cases both the original actinula and all its descendants\r\nbecome converted into medusae, so that there is no alternation of\r\ngenerations. In _Gonionemus_ the actinula becomes attached and\r\npolyp-like and reproduces by budding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After Haeckel, _System der Medusen_, by permission of\r\nGustav Fischer.\r\n\r\nFIG. 64. _Olindias mülleri._]\r\n\r\n  The Trachomedusae are divided into the following families:\r\n\r\n  1. _Petasidae_ (_Petachnidae_).--Four radial canals, four gonads;\r\n  stomach not prolonged into the manubrium, which is relatively short;\r\n  tentaculocysts free. _Petasus_ and other genera make up this family,\r\n  founded by Haeckel, but no other naturalist has ever seen them, and it\r\n  is probable that they are simply immature forms of other genera.\r\n\r\n  2. _Olindiadae_, with four radial canals and four gonads; manubrium\r\n  short; ring-canals giving off blind centripetal canals; tentaculocysts\r\n  enclosed. _Olindias mülleri_ (fig. 64) is a common Mediterranean\r\n  species. Other genera are _Aglauropsis_, _Gossea_ and _Gonionemus_;\r\n  the last named bears adhesive suckers on the tentacles. Some doubt\r\n  attaches to the position of this family. It has been asserted that the\r\n  tentaculocysts are entirely ectodermal and that either the family\r\n  should be placed amongst the Leptomedusae, or should form, together\r\n  with certain Leptomedusae, an entirely distinct order. In\r\n  _Gonionemus_, however, the concrement-cells are endodermal.\r\n\r\n  3. _Trachynemidae._--Eight radial canals, eight gonads, stomach not\r\n  prolonged into manubrium; tentaculocysts enclosed. _Rhopalonema_,\r\n  _Trachynema_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After E. T. Browne, _Proc. Zool. Soc. of London_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 65.--_Aglantha rosea_ (Forbes), a British medusa.]\r\n\r\n  4. _Ptychogastridae_ (_Pectyllidae_).--As in the preceding, but with\r\n  suckers on the tentacles. _Ptychogastria_ Allman (=_Pectyllis_), a\r\n  deep-sea form.\r\n\r\n  5. _Aglauridae._--Eight radial canals, two, four or eight gonads;\r\n  tentacles numerous; tentaculocysts free; stomach prolonged into\r\n  manubrium. _Aglaura_, _Aglantha_ (fig. 65), &c., with eight gonads;\r\n  _Stauraglaura_ with four; _Persa_ with two. _Amphogona_,\r\n  hermaphrodite, with male and female gonads on alternating radial\r\n  canals.\r\n\r\n  6. _Geryonidae._--Four or six radial canals; gonads band-like; stomach\r\n  prolonged into a manubrium of great length; tentaculocysts enclosed.\r\n  _Liriope_, &c., with four radial canals; _Geryonia_, _Carmarina_ (fig.\r\n  26), &c., with six.\r\n\r\n  7. _Halicreidae._--Eight very broad radial canals; ex-umbrella often\r\n  provided with lateral outgrowths; tentacles differing in size, but in\r\n  a single row. _Halicreas_.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 2. NARCOMEDUSAE.--Margin of the umbrella-lobed, tentacles\r\narising from the ex-umbrella at some distance from the margin;\r\ntentaculocysts exposed, not enclosed in vesicles; gonads on the\r\nsub-umbral floor of the stomach or of the gastric pouches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--_Cunina rhododactyla_, one of the\r\n_Narcomedusae_. (After Haeckel.)\r\n\r\n  c, Circular canal.\r\n  h, \"Otoporpae\" or centripetal process of the marginal cartilaginous\r\n    ring connected with tentaculocyst.\r\n  k, Stomach.\r\n  l, Jelly of the disk.\r\n  r, Radiating canal (pouch of stomach).\r\n  tt, Tentacles.\r\n  tw, Tentacle root.]\r\n\r\nThe Narcomedusae exhibit peculiarities of form and structure which\r\ndistinguish them at once from all other Hydromedusae. The umbrella is\r\nshallow and has the margin supported by a rim of thickened ectoderm, as\r\nin the Trachomedusae, but not so strongly developed. The tentacles are\r\nnot inserted on the margin of the umbrella, but arise high up on the\r\nex-umbral surface, and the umbrella is prolonged into lobes\r\ncorresponding to the interspaces between the tentacles. The condition of\r\nthings can be imagined by supposing that in a medusa primitively of\r\nnormal build, with tentacles at the margin, the umbrella has grown down\r\npast the insertion of the tentacles. As a result of this extension of\r\nthe umbrellar margin, all structures belonging to this region, namely,\r\nthe ring-canal, the nerve-rings, and the rim of thickened ectoderm, do\r\nnot run an even course, but are thrown into festoons, caught up under\r\nthe insertion of each tentacle in such a way that the ring-canal and its\r\naccompaniments form in each notch of the umbrellar margin an inverted V,\r\nthe apex of which corresponds to the insertion of the tentacle; in some\r\ncases the limbs of the V may run for some distance parallel to one\r\nanother, and may be fused into one, giving a figure better compared to\r\nan inverted Y. Thus the ectodermal rim runs round the edge of each lobe\r\nof the umbrella and then passes upwards towards the base of the tentacle\r\nfrom the re-entering angle between two adjacent lobes, to form with its\r\nfellow of the next lobe a tentacle-clasp or _peronium_, i.e. a streak of\r\nthickened ectoderm supporting the tentacle. Similarly the ring-canal\r\nruns round the edge of the lobe as the so-called festoon-canal, and then\r\nruns upwards under the peronium to the base of the tentacle as one of a\r\npair of peronial canals, the limbs of the V-like figure already\r\nmentioned. The nerve-rings have a similar course. The tentaculocysts are\r\nimplanted round the margins of the lobes of the umbrella and may be\r\nsupported by prolongations of the ectodermal rim termed _otoporpae_\r\n(_Gehörspangen_). The radial canals are represented by wide gastric\r\npouches, and may be absent, so that the tentacles arise directly from\r\nthe stomach (_Solmaridae_). The tentacles are always solid, as in\r\nTrachomedusae.\r\n\r\nThe development of the Narcomedusae is in the main similar to that of\r\nthe Trachomedusae, but shows some remarkable features. In _Aeginopsis_ a\r\nplanula is formed by multipolar immigration. The two ends of the planula\r\nbecome greatly lengthened and give rise to the two primary tentacles of\r\nthe actinula, of which the mouth arises from one side of the planula.\r\nHence the principal axis of the future medusa corresponds, not to the\r\nlongitudinal axis of the planula, but to a transverse axis. This is in\r\nsome degree parallel to the cases described above, in which a planula\r\ngives rise to the hydrorhiza, and buds a polyp laterally.\r\n\r\nIn _Cunina_ and allied genera the actinula, formed in the manner\r\ndescribed, has a hypostome of great length, quite disproportionate to\r\nthe size of the body, and is further endowed with the power of producing\r\nbuds from a stolon arising from the aboral side of the body. In these\r\nspecies the actinula is parasitic upon another medusa; for instance,\r\n_Cunoctantha octonaria_ upon _Turritopsis_, _C. proboscidea_ upon\r\n_Liriope_ or _Geryonia_. The parasite effects a lodgment in the host\r\neither by invading it as a free-swimming planula, or, apparently, in\r\nother cases, as a spore-embryo which is captured and swallowed as food\r\nby the host. The parasitic actinula is found attached to the proboscis\r\nof the medusa; it thrusts its greatly elongated hypostome into the mouth\r\nof the medusa and nourishes itself upon the food in the digestive cavity\r\nof its host. At the same time it produces buds from an aboral stolon.\r\nThe buds become medusae by the direct method of budding described above.\r\nIn some cases the buds do not become detached at once, but the stolon\r\ncontinues to grow and to produce more buds, forming a \"bud-spike\"\r\n(_Knospenähre_), which consists of the axial stolon bearing medusa-buds\r\nin all stages of development. In such cases the original parent-actinula\r\ndoes not itself become a medusa, but remains arrested in development and\r\nultimately dies off, so that a true alternation of generations is\r\nbrought about. It is in these parasitic forms that we meet with the\r\nmethod of reproduction by sporogony described above.\r\n\r\nIn other Narcomedusae, e.g. _Cunoctantha fowleri_ Browne, buds are\r\nformed from the sub-umbrella on the under side of the stomach pouches,\r\nwhere later the gonads are developed.\r\n\r\n  _Classification._--Three families of Narcomedusae are recognized (see\r\n  O. Maas [40]):\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After O. Maas, _Craspedoten Medusen der Siboga\r\n  Expedition_, by permission of E. S. Brill & Co.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 67.--_Solmundella bitentaculata_ (Quoy and Gaimard).]\r\n\r\n  1. _Cunanthidae._--With broad gastric pouches which are simple, i.e.\r\n  undivided, and \"pernemal,\" i.e. correspond in position with the\r\n  tentacles. _Cunina_ (fig. 66) with more than eight tentacles;\r\n  _Cunoctantha_ with eight tentacles, four perradial, four interradial.\r\n\r\n  2. _Aeginidae._--Radii a multiple of four, with radial gastric pouches\r\n  bifurcated or subdivided; the tentacles are implanted in the notch\r\n  between the two subdivisions of each (primary) gastric pouch, hence\r\n  the (secondary) gastric pouches appear to be \"internemal\" in position,\r\n  i.e. to alternate in position with the tentacles. _Aegina_, with four\r\n  tentacles and eight pouches; _Aeginura_ (fig. 25), with eight\r\n  tentacles and sixteen pouches; _Solmundella_ (fig. 67), with two\r\n  tentacles and eight pouches; _Aeginopsis_ (fig. 23), with two or four\r\n  tentacles and sixteen pouches.\r\n\r\n  3. _Solmaridae._--No gastric pouches; the numerous tentacles arise\r\n  direct from the stomach, into which also the peronial canals open, so\r\n  that the ring-canal is cut up into separate festoons. _Solmaris_,\r\n  _Pegantha_, _Polyxenia_, &c. To this family should be referred,\r\n  probably, the genus _Hydroctena_, described by C. Dawydov [11a] and\r\n  regarded by him as intermediate between Hydromedusae and Ctenophora.\r\n  See O. Maas [35].\r\n\r\n  _Appendix to the Trachylinae._\r\n\r\n  Of doubtful position, but commonly referred to the Trachylinae, are\r\n  the two genera of fresh-water medusae, _Limnocodium_ and _Limnocnida_.\r\n\r\n  _Limnocodium sowerbyi_ was first discovered in the _Victoria regia_\r\n  tank in the Botanic Gardens, Regent's Park, London. Since then it has\r\n  been discovered in other botanic gardens in various parts of Europe,\r\n  its two most recent appearances being at Lyons (1901) and Munich\r\n  (1905), occurring always in tanks in which the _Victoria regia_ is\r\n  cultivated, a fact which indicates that tropical South America is its\r\n  original habitat. In the same tanks a small hydroid, very similar to\r\n  _Microhydra_, has been found, which bears medusa-buds and is probably\r\n  the stock from which the medusa is budded. It is a remarkable fact\r\n  that all specimens of _Limnocodium_ hitherto seen have been males; it\r\n  may be inferred from this either that only one polyp-stock has been\r\n  introduced into Europe, from which all the medusae seen hitherto have\r\n  been budded, or perhaps that the female medusa is a sessile gonophore,\r\n  as in _Pennaria_. The male gonads are carried on the radial canals.\r\n\r\n  _Limnocnida tanganyicae_ was discovered first in Lake Tanganyika, but\r\n  has since been discovered also in Lake Victoria and in the river\r\n  Niger. It differs from _Limnocodium_ in having practically no\r\n  manubrium but a wide mouth two-thirds the diameter of the umbrella\r\n  across. It buds medusae from the margin of the mouth in May and June,\r\n  and in August and September the gonads are formed in the place where\r\n  the buds arose. The hydroid phase, if any, is not known.\r\n\r\n  Both these medusae have sense-organs of a peculiar type, which are\r\n  said to contain an endodermal axis like the sense-organs of\r\n  Trachylinae, but the fact has recently been called in question for\r\n  _Limnocodium_ by S. Goto, who considers the genus to be allied to\r\n  _Olindias_. Allman, on the other hand, referred _Limnocodium_ to the\r\n  Leptomedusae.\r\n\r\n  In this connexion must be mentioned, finally, the medusae budded from\r\n  the fresh-water polyp _Microhydra_. The polyp-stages of _Limnocodium_\r\n  and _Microhydra_ are extremely similar in character. In both cases the\r\n  hydranth is extremely reduced and has no tentacles, and the polyp\r\n  forms a colony by budding from the base. In _Limnocodium_ the body\r\n  secretes a gelatinous mucus to which adhere particles of mud, &c.,\r\n  forming a protective covering. In _Microhydra_ no such protecting case\r\n  is formed. In view of the great resemblance between _Microhydra_ and\r\n  the polyp of _Limnocodium_, it might be expected that the medusae to\r\n  which they give origin would also be similar. As yet, however, the\r\n  medusa of _Microhydra_ has only been seen in an immature condition,\r\n  but it shows some well-marked differences from _Limnocodium_,\r\n  especially in the structure of the tentacles, which furnish useful\r\n  characters for distinguishing species amongst medusae. The possession\r\n  of a polyp-stage by _Limnocodium_ and _Microhydra_ furnishes an\r\n  argument against placing them in the Trachylinae. Their sense-organs\r\n  require renewed investigations.

Siphonophora.--Pelagic floating Hydrozoa with great\r\ndifferentiation of parts, each performing a special function; generally\r\nregarded as colonies showing differentiation of individuals in\r\ncorrespondence with a physiological division of labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Diagram showing possible modifications of\r\nmedusiform and hydriform persons of a colony of _Siphonophora_.

The coenosarc does not differ in structure from that\r\nalready described in colonial Hydrozoa. It consists of a hollow tube, or\r\ntubes, of which the wall is made up of the two body-layers, ectoderm and\r\nendoderm, and the cavity is a continuation of the digestive cavities of\r\nthe nutritive and other appendages, i.e. of the coelenteron. The\r\ncoenosarc may consist of a single elongated tube or stolon, forming the\r\nstem or axis of the cormus on which, usually, the appendages are\r\narranged in groups termed cormidia; or it may take the form of a compact\r\nmass of ramifying, anastomosing tubes, in which case the cormus as a\r\nwhole has a compact form and _cormidia_ are not distinguishable. In the\r\nDisconectae the coenosarc forms a spongy mass, the \"_centradenia_,\"\r\nwhich is partly hepatic in function, forming the so-called liver, and\r\npartly excretory.\r\n\r\nThe appendages show various types of form and structure corresponding to\r\ndifferent functions. The cormus is always differentiated into two parts;\r\nan upper portion termed the _nectosome_, in which the appendages are\r\nlocomotor or hydrostatic in function, that is to say, serve for swimming\r\nor floating; and a lower portion termed the _siphosome_, bearing\r\nappendages which are nutritive, reproductive or simply protective in\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nDivergent views have been held by different authors both as regards the\r\nnature of the cormus as a whole, and as regards the homologies of the\r\ndifferent types of appendages borne by it.\r\n\r\n  The general theories of Siphonophoran morphology are discussed below,\r\n  but in enumerating the various types of appendages it is convenient to\r\n  discuss their morphological interpretation at the same time.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After A. Agassiz, from Lankester's _Treatise on\r\n  Zoology_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 69.--_Porpita_, seen from above, showing the pneumatophore and\r\n  expanded palpons.]\r\n\r\n  In the nectosome one or more of the following types of appendage\r\n  occur:--\r\n\r\n  1. Swimming-bells, termed _nectocalyces_ or _nectophores_ (fig. 68,\r\n  k), absent in _Chondrophorida_ and _Cystophorida_; they are\r\n  contractile and resemble, both in appearance, structure and function,\r\n  the umbrella of a medusa, with radial canals, ring-canal and velum;\r\n  but they are without manubrium, tentacles or sense-organs, and are\r\n  always bilaterally symmetrical, a peculiarity of form related with the\r\n  fact that they are attached on one side to the stem. A given cormus\r\n  may bear one or several nectocalyces, and by their contractions they\r\n  propel the colony slowly along, like so many medusae harnessed\r\n  together. In cases where the cormus has no pneumatophore the topmost\r\n  swimming bell may contain an oil-reservoir or _oleocyst_.\r\n\r\n  2. The pneumatophore or air-bladder (fig. 68, n), for passive\r\n  locomotion, forming a float which keeps the cormus at or near the\r\n  surface of the water. The pneumatophore arises from the ectoderm as a\r\n  pit or invagination, part of which forms a gas-secreting gland, while\r\n  the rest gives rise to an air-sack lined by a chitinous cuticle. The\r\n  orifice of invagination forms a pore which may be closed up or may\r\n  form a protruding duct or funnel. As in the analogous swim-bladder of\r\n  fishes, the gas in the pneumatophore can be secreted or absorbed,\r\n  whereby the specific gravity of the body can be diminished or\r\n  increased, so as to cause it to float nearer the surface or at a\r\n  deeper level. Never more than one pneumatophore is found in a cormus,\r\n  and when present it is always situated at the highest point above the\r\n  swimming bells, if these are present also. In _Velella_ the\r\n  pneumatophore becomes of complex structure and sends air-tubes, lined\r\n  by a chitin and resembling tracheae, down into the compact coenosarc,\r\n  thus evidently serving a respiratory as well as a hydrostatic\r\n  function.\r\n\r\n  Divergent views have been held as to the morphological significance of\r\n  the pneumatophore. E. Haeckel regarded the whole structure as a\r\n  glandular ectodermal pit formed on the ex-umbral surface of a\r\n  medusa-person. C. Chun and, more recently, R. Woltereck [59], on the\r\n  other hand, have shown that the ectodermal pit which gives rise to the\r\n  pneumatophore represents an entocodon. Hence the cavity of the\r\n  air-sack is equivalent to a sub-umbral cavity in which no manubrium is\r\n  formed, and the pore or orifice of invagination would represent the\r\n  margin of the umbrella. In the wall of the sack is a double layer of\r\n  endoderm, the space between which is a continuation of the\r\n  coelenteron. By coalescence of the endoderm-layers, the coelenteron\r\n  may be reduced to vessels, usually eight in number, opening into a\r\n  ring-sinus surrounding the pore. Thus the disposition of the\r\n  endoderm-cavities is roughly comparable to the gastrovascular system\r\n  of a medusa.\r\n\r\n  The difference between the theories of Haeckel and Chun is connected\r\n  with a further divergence in the interpretation of the stem or axis of\r\n  the cormus. Haeckel regards it as the equivalent of the manubrium, and\r\n  as it is implanted on the blind end of the pneumatophore, such a view\r\n  leads necessarily to the air-sack and gland being a development on the\r\n  ex-umbral surface of the medusa-person. Chun and Woltereck, on the\r\n  other hand, regard the stem as a _stolo prolifer_ arising from the\r\n  aboral pole, that is to say, from the ex-umbrella, similar to that\r\n  which grows out from the ex-umbral surface of the embryo of the\r\n  Narcomedusae and produces buds, a view which is certainly supported by\r\n  the embryological evidence to be adduced shortly.\r\n\r\n  In the siphosome the following types of appendages occur:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Siphons_ or nutritive appendages, from which the order takes its\r\n  name; never absent and usually present in great numbers (fig. 68, e).\r\n  Each is a tube dilated at or towards the base and containing a mouth\r\n  at its extremity, leading into a stomach placed in the dilatation\r\n  already mentioned. The siphons have been compared to the manubrium of\r\n  a medusa-individual, or to polyps, and hence are sometimes termed\r\n  gastrozoids.\r\n\r\n  2. _Palpons_ (fig. 68, g), present in some genera, especially in\r\n  Physonectae; similar to the siphons but without a mouth, and purely\r\n  tactile in function, hence sometimes termed dactylozoids. If a distal\r\n  pore or aperture is present, it is excretory in function; such\r\n  varieties have been termed \"cystons\" by Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  3. _Tentacles_ (\"_Fangfäden_\"), always present, and implanted one at\r\n  the base of each siphon (fig. 68, f). The tentacles of siphonophores\r\n  may reach a great length and have a complex structure. They may bear\r\n  accessory filaments or _tentilla_ (f'), covered thickly with batteries\r\n  of nematocysts, to which these organisms owe their great powers of\r\n  offence and defence.\r\n\r\n  4. _Palpacles_ (\"_Tastfäden_\"), occurring together with palpons, one\r\n  implanted at the base of each palpon (fig. 68, h). Each palpacle is a\r\n  tactile filament, very extensile, without accessory filaments or\r\n  nematocysts.\r\n\r\n  5. _Bracts_ (\"_hydrophyllia_\"), occur in _Calycophorida_ and some\r\n  _Physophorida_ as scale-like appendages protecting other parts (fig.\r\n  68, l). The mesogloea is greatly developed in them and they are often\r\n  of very tough consistency. By Haeckel they are considered homologous\r\n  with the umbrella of a medusa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From G. H. Fowler, after A. Agassiz, Lankester's\r\n  _Treatise on Zoology_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 70.--Diagram of the structure of _Velella_, showing the central\r\n  and peripheral thirds of a half-section of the colony, the middle\r\n  third being omitted.

In their most\r\n  primitive form they are seen in _Velella_ as \"gonosiphons,\" which\r\n  possess mouths like the ordinary sterile siphons and bud free medusae.\r\n  In other forms they have no mouths. They may be branched, so-called\r\n  \"gonodendra,\" and amongst them may occur special forms of palpons,\r\n  \"gonopalpons.\" The gonostyles have been compared to the blastostyles\r\n  of a hydroid colony, or to the manubrium of a medusa which produces\r\n  free or sessile medusa-buds.\r\n\r\n  7. _Gonophores_, produced either on the gonostyles already mentioned\r\n  or budded, as in hydrocorallines, from the coenosarc, i.e. the stem\r\n  (fig. 68, i.). They show every transition between free medusae and\r\n  sporosacs, as already described, for hydroid colonies. Thus in\r\n  _Velella_ free medusae are produced, which have been described as an\r\n  independent genus of medusae, _Chrysomitra_. In other types the\r\n  medusae may be set free in a mature condition as the so-called\r\n  \"genital swimming bells,\" comparable to the _Globiceps of Pennaria_.\r\n  The most usual condition, however, is that in which sessile medusoid\r\n  gonophores or sporosacs are produced.\r\n\r\n  The various types of appendages described in the foregoing may be\r\n  arranged in groups termed _cormidia_. In forms with a compact\r\n  coenosarc such as _Velella_, _Physalia_, &c., the separate cormidia\r\n  cannot be sharply distinguished, and such a condition is described\r\n  technically as one with \"scattered\" cormidia. In forms in which, on\r\n  the other hand, the coenosarc forms an elongated, tubular axis or\r\n  stem, the appendages are arranged as regularly recurrent cormidia\r\n  along it, and the cormidia are then said to be \"ordinate.\" In such\r\n  cases the oldest cormidia, that is to say, those furthest from the\r\n  nectosome, may become detached (like the segments or proglottides of a\r\n  tape-worm) and swim off, each such detached cormidium then becoming a\r\n  small free cormus which, in many cases, has been given an independent\r\n  generic name. A cormidium may contain a single nutritive siphon\r\n  (\"monogastric\") or several siphons (\"polygastric\"):\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From G. H. Fowler, after G. Cuvier, Lankester's\r\n  _Treatise on Zoology_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 71.--Upper surface of _Velella_, showing pneumatophore and sail.]\r\n\r\n  The following are some of the forms of cormidia that occur:--\r\n\r\n  1. The _eudoxome_ (Calycophorida), consisting of a bract, siphon,\r\n  tentacle and gonophore; when free it is known as _Eudoxia_.\r\n\r\n  2. The _ersaeome_ (Calycophorida), made up of the same appendages as\r\n  the preceding type but with the addition of a nectocalyx; when free\r\n  termed _Ersaea_.\r\n\r\n  3. The _rhodalome_ of some _Rhodalidae_, consisting of siphon,\r\n  tentacle and one or more gonophores.\r\n\r\n  4. The _athorome_ of _Physophora_, &c., consisting of siphon,\r\n  tentacle, one or more palpons with palpacles, and one or more\r\n  gonophores.\r\n\r\n  5. The _crystallome_ of _Anthemodes_, &c., similar to the athorome but\r\n  with the addition of a group of bracts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 72.--A, _Diphyes campanulata_; B, a group of\r\n  appendages (cormidium) of the same _Diphyes_. (After C. Gegenbaur.)\r\n\r\n    a, Axis of the colony.\r\n    m, Nectocalyx.\r\n    c, Sub-umbral cavity of nectocalyx.\r\n    v, Radial canals of nectocalyx.\r\n    o, Orifice of nectocalyx.\r\n    t, Bract.\r\n    n, Siphon.\r\n    g, Gonophore.\r\n    i, Tentacle.]\r\n\r\n  _Embryology of the Siphonophora._--The fertilized ovum gives rise to a\r\n  parenchymula, with solid endoderm, which is set free as a\r\n  free-swimming planula larva, in the manner already described (see\r\n  HYDROZOA). The planula has its two extremities dissimilar\r\n  (Bipolaria-larva). The subsequent development is slightly different\r\n  according as the future cormus is headed by a pneumatophore\r\n  (Physophorida, Cystophorida) or by a nectocalyx (Calycophorida).\r\n\r\n  (i.) Physophorida, for example _Halistemma_ (C. Chun, HYDROZOA [1]).\r\n  The planula becomes elongated and broader towards one pole, at which a\r\n  pit or invagination of the ectoderm arises. Next the pit closes up to\r\n  form a vesicle with a pore, and so gives rise to the pneumatophore.\r\n  From the broader portion of the planula an outgrowth arises which\r\n  becomes the first tentacle of the cormus. The endoderm of the planula\r\n  now acquires a cavity, and at the narrower pole a mouth is formed,\r\n  giving rise to the primary siphon. Thus from the original planula\r\n  three appendages are, as it were, budded off, while the planula itself\r\n  mostly gives rise to coenosarc, just as in some hydroids the planula\r\n  is converted chiefly into hydrorhiza.\r\n\r\n  (ii.) Calycophorida, for example, _Muggiaea_. The planula develops, on\r\n  the whole, in a similar manner, but the ectodermal invagination\r\n  arises, not at the pole of the planula, but on the side of its broader\r\n  portion, and gives rise, not to a pneumatophore, but to a nectocalyx,\r\n  the primary swimming bell or _protocodon_ (\"_Fallschirm_\") which is\r\n  later thrown off and replaced by secondary swimming bells,\r\n  _metacodons_, budded from the coenosarc.\r\n\r\n  From a comparison of the two embryological types there can be no doubt\r\n  on two points; first, that the pneumatophore and the protocodon are\r\n  strictly homologous, and, therefore if the nectocalyx is comparable to\r\n  the umbrella of a medusa, as seems obvious, the pneumatophore must be\r\n  so too; secondly, that the coenosarcal axis arises from the\r\n  ex-umbrella of the medusa and cannot be compared to a manubrium, but\r\n  is strictly comparable to the \"bud-spike\" of a Narcomedusan.\r\n\r\n  _Theories of Siphonophore Morphology._--The many theories that have\r\n  been put forward as to the interpretation of the cormus and the\r\n  various parts are set forth and discussed in the treatise of Y. Delage\r\n  and E. Hérouard (HYDROZOA [4]) and more recently by R. Woltereck [59],\r\n  and only a brief analysis can be given here.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After C. Gegenbaur.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 73.--_Physophora hydrostatica._\r\n\r\n    a´, Pneumatocyst.\r\n    t,  Palpons.\r\n    a,  Axis of the colony.\r\n    m,  Nectocalyx.\r\n    o,  Orifice of nectocalyx.\r\n    n,  Siphon.\r\n    g,  Gonophore.\r\n    i,  Tentacle.]\r\n\r\n  In the first place the cormus has been regarded as a single individual\r\n  and its appendages as _organs_. This is the so-called \"polyorgan\"\r\n  theory, especially connected with the name of Huxley; but it must be\r\n  borne in mind that Huxley regarded all the forms produced, in any\r\n  animal, between one egg-generation and the next, as constituting in\r\n  the lump one single individual. Huxley, therefore, considered a\r\n  hydroid colony, for example, as a single individual, and each separate\r\n  polyp or medusa budded from it as having the value of an organ and not\r\n  of an individual. Hence Huxley's view is not so different from those\r\n  held by other authors as it seems to be at first sight.\r\n\r\n  In more recent years Woltereck [59] has supported Huxley's view of\r\n  individuality, at the same time drawing a fine distinction between\r\n  \"individual\" and \"person.\" The individual is the product of sexual\r\n  reproduction; a person is an individual of lower rank, which may be\r\n  produced asexually. A Siphonophore is regarded as a single individual\r\n  composed of numerous zoids, budded from the primary zoid (siphon)\r\n  produced from the planula. Any given zoid is a person-zoid if\r\n  equivalent to the primary zoid, an organ-zoid if equivalent only to a\r\n  part of it. Woltereck considers the siphonophores most nearly allied\r\n  to the Narcomedusae, producing like the buds from an aboral stolon,\r\n  the first bud being represented by the pneumatophore or protocodon, in\r\n  different cases.\r\n\r\n  Contrasting, in the second place, with the polyorgan theory are the\r\n  various \"polyperson\" theories which interpret the Siphonophore cormus\r\n  as a colony composed of more or fewer individuals in organic union\r\n  with one another. On this interpretation there is still room for\r\n  considerable divergence of opinion as regards detail. To begin with,\r\n  it is not necessary on the polyperson theory to regard each appendage\r\n  as a distinct individual; it is still possible to compare appendages\r\n  with parts of an individual which have become separated from one\r\n  another by a process of \"dislocation of organs.\" Thus a bract may be\r\n  regarded, with Haeckel, as a modified umbrella of a medusa, a siphon\r\n  as its manubrium, and a tentacle as representing a medusan tentacle\r\n  shifted in attachment from the margin to the sub-umbrella; or a siphon\r\n  may be compared with a polyp, of which the single tentacle has become\r\n  shifted so as to be attached to the coenosarc and so on. Some authors\r\n  prefer, on the other hand, to regard every appendage as a separate\r\n  individual, or at least as a portion of an individual, of which other\r\n  portions have been lost or obliterated.\r\n\r\n  A further divergence of opinion arises from differences in the\r\n  interpretation of the persons composing the colony. It is possible to\r\n  regard the cormus (1) as a colony of medusa-persons, (2) as a colony\r\n  of polyp-persons, (3) as composed partly of one, partly of the other.\r\n  It is sufficient here to mention briefly the views put forward on this\r\n  point by C. Chun and R. Haeckel.\r\n\r\n  Chun (HYDROZOA [1]) maintains the older views of Leuckart and Claus,\r\n  according to which the cormus is to be compared to a floating hydroid\r\n  colony. It may be regarded as derived from floating polyps similar to\r\n  _Nemopsis_ or _Pelagohydra_, which by budding produce a colony of\r\n  polyps and also form medusa-buds. The polyp-individuals form the\r\n  nutritive siphosome or trophosome. The medusa-buds are either fertile\r\n  or sterile. If fertile they become free medusae or sessile gonophores.\r\n  If sterile they remain attached and locomotor in function, forming the\r\n  nectosome, the pneumatophore and swimming-bells.\r\n\r\n  Haeckel, on the other hand, is in accordance with Balfour in regarding\r\n  a Siphonophore as a medusome, that is to say, as a colony composed of\r\n  medusoid persons or organs entirely. Haeckel considers that the\r\n  Siphonophores have two distinct ancestral lines of evolution:\r\n\r\n  1. In the _Disconanthae_, i.e. in such forms as _Velella_, _Porpita_,\r\n  &c., the ancestor was an eight-rayed medusa (_Disconula_) which\r\n  acquired a pneumatophore as an ectodermal pit on the ex-umbrella, and\r\n  in which the organs (manubrium, tentacles, &c.) became secondarily\r\n  multiplied, just as they do in _Gastroblasta_ as the result of\r\n  incomplete fission. The nearest living allies of the ancestral\r\n  _Disconula_ are to be sought in the _Pectyllidae_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Haeckel, from Lankester's _Treatise on Zoology_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 74.--_Stephalia corona_, a young colony.\r\n\r\n    p, Pneumatophore.\r\n    n, Nectocalyx.\r\n    l, Aurophore.\r\n    lo, Orifice of the aurophore.\r\n    s, Siphon.\r\n    t, Tentacle.]\r\n\r\n  2. In the _Siphonanthae_, i.e. in all other Siphonophores, the\r\n  ancestral form was a _Siphonula_, a bilaterally symmetrical\r\n  Anthomedusa with a single long tentacle (cf. _Corymorpha_), which\r\n  became displaced from the margin to the sub-umbrella. The _Siphonula_\r\n  produced buds on the manubrium, as many Anthomedusae are known to do,\r\n  and these by reduction or dislocation of parts gave rise to the\r\n  various appendages of the colony. Thus the umbrella of the _Siphonula_\r\n  became the protocodon, and its manubrium, the axis or stolon, which,\r\n  by a process of dislocation of organs, escaped, as it were, from the\r\n  sub-umbrella through a cleft and became secondarily attached to the\r\n  ex-umbrella. It must be pointed out that, however probable Haeckel's\r\n  theory may be in other respects, there is not the slightest evidence\r\n  for any such cleft in the umbrella having been present at any time,\r\n  and that the embryological evidence, as already pointed out, is all\r\n  against any homology between the stem and a manubrium, since the\r\n  primary siphon does not become the stem, which arises from the\r\n  ex-umbral side of the protocodon and is strictly comparable to a\r\n  stolon.\r\n\r\n_Classification._--The Siphonophora may be divided, following Delage and\r\nHérouard, into four sub-orders:\r\n\r\nI. CHONDROPHORIDA (_Disconectae_ Haeckel, _Tracheophysae_ Chun). With an\r\napical chambered pneumatophore, from which tracheal tubes may take\r\norigin (fig. 70); no nectocalyces or bracts; appendages all on the lower\r\nside of the pneumatophore arising from a compact coenosarc, and\r\nconsisting of a central principal siphon, surrounded by gonosiphons, and\r\nthese again by tentacles.\r\n\r\n  Three families: (1) _Discalidae_, for _Discalia_ and allied genera,\r\n  deep-sea forms not well known; (2) _Porpitidae_ for the familiar genus\r\n  _Porpita_ (fig. 69) and its allies; and (3) _Velellidae_, represented\r\n  by the well-known genus _Velella_ (figs. 70, 71), common in the\r\n  Mediterranean and other seas.\r\n\r\nII. CALYCOPHORIDA (_Calyconectae_, Haeckel). Without pneumatophore, with\r\none, two, rarely more nectocalyces.\r\n\r\n  Three families: (1) _Monophyidae_, with a single nectocalyx; examples\r\n  _Muggiaea_, sometimes found in British seas, _Sphaeronectes_, &c.; (2)\r\n  _Diphyidae_, with two nectocalyces; examples _Diphyes_ (fig. 72),\r\n  _Praya_, _Abyla_, &c.; and (3) _Polyphyidae_, with numerous\r\n  nectocalyces; example _Hippopodius_, _Stephanophyes_ and other genera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From G. H. Fowler, modified after G. Cuvier and E.\r\nHaeckel, Lankester's _Treatise on Zoology_.\r\n\r\nFIG. 75.--A. _Physalia_, general view, diagrammatic; B, cormidium of\r\nPhysalia; D, palpon; T, palpacle; G, siphon; GP, gonopalpon; M[male],\r\nmale gonophore; M[female], female gonophore, ultimately set free.]\r\n\r\nIII. PHYSOPHORIDA (_Physonectae_ + _Auronectae_, Haeckel). With an\r\napical pneumatophore, not divided into chambers, followed by a series of\r\nnectocalyces or bracts.\r\n\r\n  A great number of families and genera are referred to this group,\r\n  amongst which may be mentioned specially--(1) _Agalmidae_, containing\r\n  the genera _Stephanomia_, _Agalma_, _Anthemodes_, _Halistemma_, &c.;\r\n  (2) _Apolemidae_, with the genus _Apolemia_ and its allies; (3)\r\n  _Forskaliidae_, with _Forskalia_ and allied forms; (4)\r\n  _Physophoridae_, for _Physophora_ (fig. 73) and other genera, (5)\r\n  _Anthophysidae_, for _Anthophysa_, _Athorybia_, &c.; and lastly the\r\n  two families (6) _Rhodalidae_ and (7) _Stephalidae_ (fig. 74),\r\n  constituting the group Auronectae of Haeckel. The Auronectae are\r\n  peculiar deep-sea forms, little known except from Haeckel's\r\n  descriptions, in which the large pneumatophore has a peculiar duct,\r\n  termed the aurophore, placed on its lower side in the midst of a\r\n  circle of swimming-bells.\r\n\r\nIV. CYSTOPHORIDA (_Cystonectae_, Haeckel). With a very large\r\npneumatophore not divided into chambers, but without nectocalyces or\r\nbracts. Two sections can be distinguished, the Rhizophysina, with long\r\ntubular coenosarc-bearing ordinate cormidia, and Physalina, with compact\r\ncoenosarc-bearing scattered cormidia.\r\n\r\n  A type of the Rhizophysina is the genus _Rhizophysa_. The Physalina\r\n  comprise the families _Physalidae_ and _Epibulidae_, of which the\r\n  types are _Physalia_ (figs. 74, 75) and _Epibulia_, respectively.\r\n  _Physalia_, known commonly as the Portuguese man-of-war, is remarkable\r\n  for its great size, its brilliant colours, and its terrible stinging\r\n  powers.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--In addition to the works cited below, see the general\r\n  works cited in the article HYDROZOA, in some of which very full\r\n  bibliographies will be found.\r\n\r\n  1.

[Greek: hydôr], water, and [Greek: metron], a measure),\r\nan instrument for determining the density of bodies, generally of\r\nfluids, but in some cases of solids. When a body floats in a fluid under\r\nthe action of gravity, the weight of the body is equal to that of the\r\nfluid which it displaces (see HYDROMECHANICS). It is upon this principle\r\nthat the hydrometer is constructed, and it obviously admits of two modes\r\nof application in the case of fluids: either we may compare the weights\r\nof floating bodies which are capable of displacing the same volume of\r\ndifferent fluids, or we may compare the volumes of the different fluids\r\nwhich are displaced by the same weight. In the latter case, the\r\ndensities of the fluids will be inversely proportional to the volumes\r\nthus displaced.\r\n\r\nThe hydrometer is said by Synesius Cyreneus in his fifth letter to have\r\nbeen invented by Hypatia at Alexandria,[1] but appears to have been\r\nneglected until it was reinvented by Robert Boyle, whose \"New Essay\r\nInstrument,\" as described in the _Phil. Trans._ for June 1675, differs\r\nin no essential particular from Nicholson's hydrometer. This instrument\r\nwas devised for the purpose of detecting counterfeit coin, especially\r\nguineas and half-guineas. In the first section of the paper (_Phil.\r\nTrans._ No. 115, p. 329) the author refers to a glass instrument\r\nexhibited by himself many years before, and \"consisting of a bubble\r\nfurnished with a long and slender stem, which was to be put into several\r\nliquors, to compare and estimate their specific gravities.\" This seems\r\nto be the first reference to the hydrometer in modern times.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 1 C represents the instrument used for guineas, the circular\r\nplates A representing plates of lead, which are used as ballast when\r\nlighter coins than guineas are examined. B represents \"a small glass\r\ninstrument for estimating the specific gravities of liquors,\" an account\r\nof which was promised by Boyle in the following number of the _Phil.\r\nTrans._, but did not appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Boyle's New Essay Instrument.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument represented at B (fig. 1), which is copied from Robert\r\nBoyle's sketch in the _Phil. Trans._ for 1675, is generally known as the\r\ncommon hydrometer. It is usually made of glass, the lower bulb being\r\nloaded with mercury or small shot which serves as ballast, causing the\r\ninstrument to float with the stem vertical. The quantity of mercury or\r\nshot inserted depends upon the density of the liquids for which the\r\nhydrometer is to be employed, it being essential that the whole of the\r\nbulb should be immersed in the heaviest liquid for which the instrument\r\nis used, while the length and diameter of the stem must be such that the\r\nhydrometer will float in the lightest liquid for which it is required.\r\nThe stem is usually divided into a number of equal parts, the divisions\r\nof the scale being varied in different instruments, according to the\r\npurposes for which they are employed.\r\n\r\n  Let V denote the volume of the instrument immersed (i.e. of liquid\r\n  displaced) when the surface of the liquid in which the hydrometer\r\n  floats coincides with the lowest division of the scale, A the area of\r\n  the transverse section of the stem, l the length of a scale division,\r\n  n the number of divisions on the stem, and W the weight of the\r\n  instrument. Suppose the successive divisions of the scale to be\r\n  numbered 0, 1, 2 ... n starting with the lowest, and let w0, W1, w2\r\n  ... w_n be the weights of unit volume of the liquids in which the\r\n  hydrometer sinks to the divisions 0, 1, 2 ... n respectively. Then, by\r\n  the principle of Archimedes,\r\n\r\n    W = Vw0; or w0 = W/V. Also\r\n\r\n    W = (V + lA)w1; or w1 = W/(V + lA),\r\n\r\n    w_p = W/(V + plA), and\r\n\r\n    w_n= W/(V + nlA),\r\n\r\n  or the densities of the several liquids vary inversely as the\r\n  respective volumes of the instrument immersed in them; and, since the\r\n  divisions of the scale correspond to equal increments of volume\r\n  immersed, it follows that the densities of the several liquids in\r\n  which the instrument sinks to the successive divisions form a harmonic\r\n  series.\r\n\r\n  If V = NlA then N expresses the ratio of the volume of the instrument\r\n  up to the zero of the scale to that of one of the scale-divisions. If\r\n  we suppose the lower part of the instrument replaced by a uniform bar\r\n  of the same sectional area as the stem and of volume V, the\r\n  indications of the instrument will be in no respect altered, and the\r\n  bottom of the bar will be at a distance of N scale-divisions below the\r\n  zero of the scale.\r\n\r\n  In this case we have w_p = W/(N + p)lA; or the density of the liquid\r\n  varies inversely as N + p, that is, as the whole number of\r\n  scale-divisions between the bottom of the tube and the plane of\r\n  flotation.\r\n\r\n  If we wish the successive divisions of the scale to correspond to\r\n  equal increments in the density of the corresponding liquids, then the\r\n  volumes of the instrument, measured up to the successive divisions of\r\n  the scale, must form a series in harmonical progression, the lengths\r\n  of the divisions increasing as we go up the stem.\r\n\r\n  The greatest density of the liquid for which the instrument described\r\n  above can be employed is W/V, while the least density is W/(V + nlA),\r\n  or W/(V + v), where v represents the volume of the stem between the\r\n  extreme divisions of the scale. Now, by increasing v, leaving W and V\r\n  unchanged, we may increase the range of the instrument indefinitely.\r\n  But it is clear that if we increase A, the sectional area of the stem,\r\n  we shall diminish l, the length of a scale-division corresponding to a\r\n  given variation of density, and thereby proportionately diminish the\r\n  sensibility of the instrument, while diminishing the section A will\r\n  increase l and proportionately increase the sensibility, but will\r\n  diminish the range over which the instrument can be employed, unless\r\n  we increase the length of the stem in the inverse ratio of the\r\n  sectional area. Hence, to obtain great sensibility along with a\r\n  considerable range, we require very long slender stems, and to these\r\n  two objections apply in addition to the question of portability; for,\r\n  in the first place, an instrument with a very long stem requires a\r\n  very deep vessel of liquid for its complete immersion, and, in the\r\n  second place, when most of the stem is above the plane of flotation,\r\n  the stability of the instrument when floating will be diminished or\r\n  destroyed. The various devices which have been adopted to overcome\r\n  this difficulty will be described in the account given of the several\r\n  hydrometers which have been hitherto generally employed.\r\n\r\n  The plan commonly adopted to obviate the necessity of inconveniently\r\n  long stems is to construct a number of hydrometers as nearly alike as\r\n  may be, but to load them differently, so that the scale-divisions at\r\n  the bottom of the stem of one hydrometer just overlap those at the top\r\n  of the stem of the preceding. By this means a set of six hydrometers,\r\n  each having a stem rather more than 5 in. long, will be equivalent to\r\n  a single hydrometer with a stem of 30 in. But, instead of employing a\r\n  number of instruments differing only in the weights with which they\r\n  are loaded, we may employ the same instrument, and alter its weight\r\n  either by adding mercury or shot to the interior (if it can be opened)\r\n  or by attaching weights to the exterior. These two operations are not\r\n  quite equivalent, since a weight added to the interior does not affect\r\n  the volume of liquid displaced when the instrument is immersed up to a\r\n  given division of the scale, while the addition of weights to the\r\n  exterior increases the displacement. This difficulty may be met, as in\r\n  Keene's hydrometer, by having all the weights of precisely the same\r\n  volume but of different masses, and never using the instrument except\r\n  with one of these weights attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Clarke's Hydrometer.]\r\n\r\nThe first hydrometer intended for the determination of the densities of\r\nliquids, and furnished with a set of weights to be attached when\r\nnecessary, was that constructed by Mr Clarke (instrument-maker) and\r\ndescribed by J. T. Desaguliers in the _Philosophical Transactions_ for\r\nMarch and April 1730, No. 413, p. 278. The following is Desaguliers's\r\naccount of the instrument (fig. 2):--\r\n\r\n  \"After having made several fruitless trials with ivory, because it\r\n  imbibes spirituous liquors, and thereby alters its gravity, he (Mr\r\n  Clarke) at last made a copper hydrometer, represented in fig. 2,\r\n  having a brass wire of about 1 in. thick going through, and soldered\r\n  into the copper ball Bb. The upper part of this wire is filed flat on\r\n  one side, for the stem of the hydrometer, with a mark at m, to which\r\n  it sinks exactly in proof spirits. There are two other marks, A and B,\r\n  at top and bottom of the stem, to show whether the liquor be (1/10)th\r\n  above proof (as when it sinks to A), or (1/10)th under proof (as when\r\n  it emerges to B), when a brass weight such as C has been screwed on to\r\n  the bottom at c. There are a great many such weights, of different\r\n  sizes, and marked to be screwed on instead of C, for liquors that\r\n  differ more than (1/10)th from proof, so as to serve for the specific\r\n  gravities in all such proportions as relate to the mixture of\r\n  spirituous liquors, in all the variety made use of in trade. There are\r\n  also other balls for showing the specific gravities quite to common\r\n  water, which make the instrument perfect in its kind.\"\r\n\r\nClarke's hydrometer, as afterwards constructed for the purposes of the\r\nexcise, was provided with thirty-two weights to adapt it to spirits of\r\ndifferent specific gravities, and eleven smaller weights, or \"weather\r\nweights\" as they were called, which were attached to the instrument in\r\norder to correct for variations of temperature. The weights were\r\nadjusted for successive intervals of 5° F., but for degrees intermediate\r\nbetween these no additional correction was applied. The correction for\r\ntemperature thus afforded was not sufficiently accurate for excise\r\npurposes, and William Speer in his essay on the hydrometer (Tilloch's\r\n_Phil. Mag._, 1802, vol. xiv.) mentions cases in which this imperfect\r\ncompensation led to the extra duty payable upon spirits which were more\r\nthan 10% over proof being demanded on spirits which were purposely\r\ndiluted to below 10% over proof in order to avoid the charge. Clarke's\r\nhydrometer, however, remained the standard instrument for excise\r\npurposes from 1787 until it was displaced by that of Sikes.\r\n\r\nDesaguliers himself constructed a hydrometer of the ordinary type for\r\ncomparing the specific gravities of different kinds of water\r\n(Desaguliers's _Experimental Philosophy_, ii. 234). In order to give\r\ngreat sensibility to the instrument, the large glass ball was made\r\nnearly 3 in. in diameter, while the stem consisted of a wire 10 in. in\r\nlength and only (1/40)in. in diameter. The instrument weighed 4000\r\ngrains, and the addition of a grain caused it to sink through an inch.\r\nBy altering the quantity of shot in the small balls the instrument could\r\nbe adapted for liquids other than water.\r\n\r\nTo an instrument constructed for the same purpose, but on a still larger\r\nscale than that of Desaguliers, A. Deparcieux added a small dish on the\r\ntop of the stem for the reception of the weights necessary to sink the\r\ninstrument to a convenient depth. The effect of weights placed in such a\r\ndish or pan is of course the same as if they were placed within the bulb\r\nof the instrument, since they do not alter the volume of that part which\r\nis immersed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Nicholson's Hydrometer.]\r\n\r\nThe first important improvement in the hydrometer after its reinvention\r\nby Boyle was introduced by G. D. Fahrenheit, who adopted the second mode\r\nof construction above referred to, arranging his instrument so as always\r\nto displace the same volume of liquid, its weight being varied\r\naccordingly. Instead of a scale, only a single mark is placed upon the\r\nstem, which is very slender, and bears at the top a small scale pan into\r\nwhich weights are placed until the instrument sinks to the mark upon its\r\nstem. The volume of the displaced liquid being then always the same, its\r\ndensity will be proportional to the whole weight supported, that is, to\r\nthe weight of the instrument together with the weights required to be\r\nplaced in the scale pan.\r\n\r\nNicholson's hydrometer (fig. 3) combines the characteristics of\r\nFahrenheit's hydrometer and of Boyle's essay instrument.[2] The\r\nfollowing is the description given of it by W. Nicholson in the\r\n_Manchester Memoirs_, ii. 374:--\r\n\r\n  \"AA represents a small scale. It may be taken off at D. Diameter 1½\r\n  in., weight 44 grains.\r\n\r\n  \"B a stem of hardened steel wire. Diameter 1/100 in.\r\n\r\n  \"E a hollow copper globe. Diameter 2(8/10) in. Weight with stem 369\r\n  grains.\r\n\r\n  \"FF a stirrup of wire screwed to the globe at C.\r\n\r\n  \"G a small scale, serving likewise as a counterpoise. Diameter 1½ in.\r\n  Weight with stirrup 1634 grains.\r\n\r\n  \"The other dimensions may be had from the drawing, which is one-sixth\r\n  of the linear magnitude of the instrument itself.\r\n\r\n  \"In the construction it is assumed that the upper scale shall\r\n  constantly carry 1000 grains when the lower scale is empty, and the\r\n  instrument sunk in distilled water at the temperature of 60° Fahr. to\r\n  the middle of the wire or stem. The length of the stem is arbitrary,\r\n  as is likewise the distance of the lower scale from the surface of the\r\n  globe. But, the length of the stem being settled, the lower scale may\r\n  be made lighter, and, consequently, the globe less, the greater its\r\n  distance is taken from the surface of the globe; and the contrary.\"\r\n\r\nIn comparing the densities of different liquids, it is clear that this\r\ninstrument is precisely equivalent to that of Fahrenheit, and must be\r\nemployed in the same manner, weights being placed in the top scale only\r\nuntil the hydrometer sinks to the mark on the wire, when the specific\r\ngravity of the liquid will be proportional to the weight of the\r\ninstrument together with the weights in the scale.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent portion of the paper above referred to, Nicholson\r\nexplains how the instrument may be employed as a thermometer, since,\r\nfluids generally expanding more than the solids of which the instrument\r\nis constructed, the instrument will sink as the temperature rises.\r\n\r\n  To determine the density of solids heavier than water with this\r\n  instrument, let the solid be placed in the upper scale pan, and let\r\n  the weight now required to cause the instrument to sink in distilled\r\n  water at standard temperature to the mark B be denoted by w, while W\r\n  denotes the weight required when the solid is not present. Then W - w\r\n  is the weight of the solid. Now let the solid be placed in the lower\r\n  pan, care being taken that no bubbles of air remain attached to it,\r\n  and let w1 be the weight now required in the scale pan. This weight\r\n  will exceed w in consequence of the water displaced by the solid, and\r\n  the weight of the water thus displaced will be W1 - w, which is\r\n  therefore the weight of a volume of water equal to that of the solid.\r\n  Hence, since the weight of the solid itself is W - w, its density must\r\n  be (W - w)/(w1 - w).\r\n\r\nThe above example illustrates how Nicholson's or Fahrenheit's hydrometer\r\nmay be employed as a weighing machine for small weights.\r\n\r\nIn all hydrometers in which a part only of the instrument is immersed,\r\nthere is a liability to error in consequence of the surface tension, or\r\ncapillary action, as it is frequently called, along the line of contact\r\nof the instrument and the surface of the liquid (see CAPILLARY ACTION).\r\nThis error diminishes as the diameter of the stem is reduced, but is\r\nsensible in the case of the thinnest stem which can be employed, and is\r\nthe chief source of error in the employment of Nicholson's hydrometer,\r\nwhich otherwise would be an instrument of extreme delicacy and\r\nprecision. The following is Nicholson's statement on this point:--\r\n\r\n  \"One of the greatest difficulties which attends hydrostatical\r\n  experiments arises from the attraction or repulsion that obtains at\r\n  the surface of the water. After trying many experiments to obviate the\r\n  irregularities arising from this cause, I find reason to prefer the\r\n  simple one of carefully wiping the whole instrument, and especially\r\n  the stem, with a clean cloth. The weights in the dish must not be\r\n  esteemed accurate while there is either a cumulus or a cavity in the\r\n  water round the stem.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible by applying a little oil to the upper part of the bulb of\r\na common or of a Sikes's hydrometer, and carefully placing it in pure\r\nwater, to cause it to float with the upper part of the bulb and the\r\nwhole of the stem emerging as indicated in fig. 4, when it ought\r\nproperly to sink almost to the top of the stem, the surface tension of\r\nthe water around the circumference of the circle of contact, AA',\r\nproviding the additional support required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n  The universal hydrometer of G. Atkins, described in the _Phil. Mag._\r\n  for 1808, xxxi. 254, is merely Nicholson's hydrometer with the screw\r\n  at C projecting through the collar into which it is screwed, and\r\n  terminating in a sharp point above the cup G. To this point soft\r\n  bodies lighter than water (which would float if placed in the cup)\r\n  could be attached, and thus completely immersed. Atkins's instrument\r\n  was constructed so as to weigh 700 grains, and when immersed to the\r\n  mark on the stem in distilled water at 60° F. it carried 300 grains in\r\n  the upper dish. The hydrometer therefore displaced 1000 grains of\r\n  distilled water at 60° F. and hence the specific gravity of any other\r\n  liquid was at once indicated by adding 700 to the number of grains in\r\n  the pan required to make the instrument sink to the mark on the stem.\r\n  The small divisions on the scale corresponded to differences of\r\n  (1/10)th of a grain in the weight of the instrument.\r\n\r\n  The \"Gravimeter,\" constructed by Citizen Guyton and described in\r\n  _Nicholson's Journal_, 4to, i. 110, differs from Nicholson's\r\n  instrument in being constructed of glass, and having a cylindrical\r\n  bulb about 21 centimetres in length and 22 millimetres in diameter.\r\n  Its weight is so adjusted that an additional weight of 5 grammes must\r\n  be placed in the upper pan to cause the instrument to sink to the mark\r\n  on the stem in distilled water at the standard temperature. The\r\n  instrument is provided with an additional piece, or \"plongeur,\" the\r\n  weight of which exceeds 5 grammes by the weight of water which it\r\n  displaces; that is to say, it is so constructed as to weigh 5 grammes\r\n  in water, and consists of a glass envelope filled with mercury. It is\r\n  clear that the effect of this \"plongeur,\" when placed in the lower\r\n  pan, is exactly the same as that of the 5 gramme weight in the upper\r\n  pan. Without the extra 5 grammes the instrument weighs about 20\r\n  grammes, and therefore floats in a liquid of specific gravity .8. Thus\r\n  deprived of its additional weight it may be used for spirits. To use\r\n  the instrument for liquids of much greater density than water\r\n  additional weights must be placed in the upper pan, and the \"plongeur\"\r\n  is then placed in the lower pan for the purpose of giving to the\r\n  instrument the requisite stability.\r\n\r\n  Charles's balance areometer is similar to Nicholson's hydrometer,\r\n  except that the lower basin admits of inversion, thus enabling the\r\n  instrument to be employed for solids lighter than water, the inverted\r\n  basin serving the same purpose as the pointed screw in Atkins's\r\n  modification of the instrument.\r\n\r\n  Adie's sliding hydrometer is of the ordinary form, but can be adjusted\r\n  for liquids of widely differing specific gravities by drawing out a\r\n  sliding tube, thus changing the volume of the hydrometer while its\r\n  weight remains constant.\r\n\r\n  The hydrometer of A. Baumé, which has been extensively used in France,\r\n  consists of a common hydrometer graduated in the following manner.\r\n  Certain fixed points were first determined upon the stem of the\r\n  instrument. The first of these was found by immersing the hydrometer\r\n  in pure water, and marking the stem at the level of the surface. This\r\n  formed the zero of the scale. Fifteen standard solutions of pure\r\n  common salt in water were then prepared, containing respectively 1, 2,\r\n  3, ... 15% (by weight) of dry salt. The hydrometer was plunged in\r\n  these solutions in order, and the stem having been marked at the\r\n  several surfaces, the degrees so obtained were numbered 1, 2, 3, ...\r\n  15. These degrees were, when necessary, repeated along the stem by the\r\n  employment of a pair of compasses till 80 degrees were marked off. The\r\n  instrument thus adapted to the determination of densities exceeding\r\n  that of water was called the hydrometer for salts.\r\n\r\n  The hydrometer intended for densities less than that of water, or the\r\n  hydrometer for spirits, is constructed on a similar principle. The\r\n  instrument is so arranged that it floats in pure water with most of\r\n  the stem above the surface. A solution containing 10% of pure salt is\r\n  used to indicate the zero of the scale, and the point at which the\r\n  instrument floats when immersed in distilled water at 10° R. (54½° F.)\r\n  is numbered 10. Equal divisions are then marked off upwards along the\r\n  stem as far as the 50th degree.\r\n\r\n  The densities corresponding to the several degrees of Baumé's\r\n  hydrometer are given by Nicholson (_Journal of Philosophy_, i. 89) as\r\n  follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Baumé's Hydrometer for Spirits.

The point at which the instrument floated in distilled\r\n  water was marked 10° by Cartier, and 30° on Carrier's scale\r\n  corresponded to 32° on Baumé's.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps the main object for which hydrometers have been constructed is\r\n  the determination of the value of spirituous liquors, chiefly for\r\n  revenue purposes. To this end an immense variety of hydrometers have\r\n  been devised, differing mainly in the character of their scales.\r\n\r\n  In Speer's hydrometer the stem has the form of an octagonal prism, and\r\n  upon each of the eight faces a scale is engraved, indicating the\r\n  percentage strength of the spirit corresponding to the several\r\n  divisions of the scale, the eight scales being adapted respectively to\r\n  the temperature 35°, 40°, 45°, 50°, 55°, 60°, 65° and 70° F. Four\r\n  small pins, which can be inserted into the counterpoise of the\r\n  instrument, serve to adapt the instrument to the temperatures\r\n  intermediate between those for which the scales are constructed.\r\n  William Speer was supervisor and chief assayer of spirits in the port\r\n  of Dublin. For a more complete account of this instrument see\r\n  Tilloch's _Phil. Mag._, xiv. 151.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--Jones's Hydrometer.]\r\n\r\n  The hydrometer constructed by Jones, of Holborn, consists of a\r\n  spheroidal bulb with a rectangular stem (fig. 5). Between the bulb and\r\n  counterpoise is placed a thermometer, which serves to indicate the\r\n  temperature of the liquid, and the instrument is provided with three\r\n  weights which can be attached to the top of the stem. On the four\r\n  sides of the stem AD are engraved four scales corresponding\r\n  respectively to the unloaded instrument, and to the instrument loaded\r\n  with the respective weights. The instrument when unloaded serves for\r\n  the range from 74 to 47 over proof; when loaded with the first weight\r\n  it indicates from 46 to 13 over proof, with the second weight from 13\r\n  over proof to 29 under proof, and with the third from 29 under proof\r\n  to pure water, the graduation corresponding to which is marked W at\r\n  the bottom of the fourth scale. One side of the stem AD is shown in\r\n  fig. 5, the other three in fig. 6. The thermometer is also provided\r\n  with four scales corresponding to the scales above mentioned. Each\r\n  scale has its zero in the middle corresponding to 60° F. If the\r\n  mercury in the thermometer stand above this zero the spirit must be\r\n  reckoned weaker than the hydrometer indicates by the number on the\r\n  thermometer scale level with the top of the mercury, while if the\r\n  thermometer indicate a temperature lower than the zero of the scale\r\n  (60° F.) the spirit must be reckoned stronger by the scale reading. At\r\n  the side of each of the four scales on the stem of the hydrometer is\r\n  engraved a set of small numbers indicating the contraction in volume\r\n  which would be experienced if the requisite amount of water (or\r\n  spirit) were added to bring the sample tested to the proof strength.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n  The hydrometer constructed by Dicas of Liverpool is provided with a\r\n  sliding scale which can be adjusted for different temperatures, and\r\n  which also indicates the contraction in volume incident on bringing\r\n  the spirit to proof strength. It is provided with thirty-six different\r\n  weights which, with the ten divisions on the stem, form a scale from 0\r\n  to 370. The employment of so many weights renders the instrument\r\n  ill-adapted for practical work where speed is an object.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Atkins's Hydrometer.]\r\n\r\n  This instrument was adopted by the United States in 1790, but was\r\n  subsequently discarded by the Internal Revenue Service for another\r\n  type. In this latter form the observations have to be made at the\r\n  standard temperature of 60° F., at which the graduation 100\r\n  corresponds to proof spirit and 200 to absolute alcohol. The need of\r\n  adjustable weights is avoided by employing a set of five instruments,\r\n  graduated respectively 0°-100°, 80°-120°, 100°-140°, 130°-170°,\r\n  160°-200°. The reading gives the volume of proof spirit equivalent to\r\n  the volume of liquor; thus the readings 80° and 120° mean that 100\r\n  volumes of the test liquors contain the same amount of absolute\r\n  alcohol as 80 and 120 volumes of proof spirit respectively. Proof\r\n  spirit is defined in the United States as a mixture of alcohol and\r\n  water which contains equal volumes of alcohol and water at 60° F., the\r\n  alcohol having a specific gravity of 0.7939 at 60° as compared with\r\n  water at its maximum density. The specific gravity of proof spirit is\r\n  0.93353 at 60°; and 100 volumes of the mixture is made from 50 volumes\r\n  of absolute alcohol and 53.71 volumes of water.\r\n\r\n  Quin's universal hydrometer is described in the _Transactions of the\r\n  Society of Arts_, viii. 98. It is provided with a sliding rule to\r\n  adapt it to different temperatures, and has four scales, one of which\r\n  is graduated for spirits and the other three serve to show the\r\n  strengths of worts. The peculiarity of the instrument consists in the\r\n  pyramidal form given to the stem, which renders the scale-divisions\r\n  more nearly equal in length than they would be on a prismatic stem.\r\n\r\n  Atkins's hydrometer, as originally constructed, is described in\r\n  _Nicholson's Journal_, 8vo, ii. 276. It is made of brass, and is\r\n  provided with a spheroidal bulb the axis of which is 2 in. in length,\r\n  the conjugate diameter being 1½ in. The whole length of the instrument\r\n  is 8 in., the stem square of about 1/8-in. side, and the weight about\r\n  400 grains. It is provided with four weights, marked 1, 2, 3, 4, and\r\n  weighing respectively 20, 40, 61 and 84 grains, which can be attached\r\n  to the shank of the instrument at C (fig. 7) and retained there by the\r\n  fixed weight B. The scale engraved upon one face of the stem contains\r\n  fifty-five divisions, the top and bottom being marked 0 or zero and\r\n  the alternate intermediate divisions (of which there are twenty-six)\r\n  being marked with the letters of the alphabet in order. The four\r\n  weights are so adjusted that, if the instrument floats with the stem\r\n  emerging as far as the lower division 0 with one of the weights\r\n  attached, then replacing the weight by the next heavier causes the\r\n  instrument to sink through the whole length of the scale to the upper\r\n  division 0, and the first weight produces the same effect when applied\r\n  to the naked instrument. The stem is thus virtually extended to five\r\n  times its length, and the number of divisions increased practically to\r\n  272. When no weight is attached the instrument indicates densities\r\n  from .806 to .843; with No. 1 it registers from .843 to .880, with No.\r\n  2 from .880 to .918, with No. 3 from .918 to .958, and with No. 4 from\r\n  .958 to 1.000, the temperature being 55° F. It will thus be seen that\r\n  the whole length of the stem corresponds to a difference of density of\r\n  about .04, and one division to about .00074, indicating a difference\r\n  of little more than 1/3% in the strength of any sample of spirits.\r\n\r\n  The instrument is provided with a sliding rule, with scales\r\n  corresponding to the several weights, which indicate the specific\r\n  gravity corresponding to the several divisions of the hydrometer scale\r\n  compared with water at 55° F. The slider upon the rule serves to\r\n  adjust the scale for different temperatures, and then indicates the\r\n  strength of the spirit in percentages over or under proof. The slider\r\n  is also provided with scales, marked respectively Dicas and Clarke,\r\n  which serve to show the readings which would have been obtained had\r\n  the instruments of those makers been employed. The line on the scale\r\n  marked \"concentration\" indicates the diminution in volume consequent\r\n  upon reducing the sample to proof strength (if it is _over proof_,\r\n  O.P.) or upon reducing proof spirit to the strength of the sample (if\r\n  it is _under proof_, U.P.). By applying the several weights in\r\n  succession in addition to No. 4 the instrument can be employed for\r\n  liquids heavier than water; and graduations on the other three sides\r\n  of the stem, together with an additional slide rule, adapt the\r\n  instrument for the determination of the strength of worts.\r\n\r\n  Atkins subsequently modified the instrument (_Nicholson's Journal_,\r\n  8vo, iii. 50) by constructing the different weights of different\r\n  shapes, viz. circular, square, triangular and pentagonal, instead of\r\n  numbering them 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively, a figure of the weight\r\n  being stamped on the sliding rule opposite to every letter in the\r\n  series to which it belongs, thus diminishing the probability of\r\n  mistakes. He also replaced the letters on the stem by the\r\n  corresponding specific gravities referred to water as unity. Further\r\n  information concerning these instruments and the state of hydrometry\r\n  in 1803 will be found in Atkins's pamphlet _On the Relation between\r\n  the Specific Gravities and the Strength of Spirituous Liquors_ (1803);\r\n  or _Phil. Mag._ xvi. 26-33, 205-212, 305-312; xvii. 204-210 and\r\n  329-341.\r\n\r\n  In Gay-Lussac's alcoholometer the scale is divided into 100 parts\r\n  corresponding to the presence of 1, 2, ... % by volume of alcohol at\r\n  15° C., the highest division of the scale corresponding to the purest\r\n  alcohol he could obtain (density .7947) and the lowest division\r\n  corresponding to pure water. A table provides the necessary\r\n  corrections for other temperatures.\r\n\r\n  Tralles's hydrometer differs from Gay-Lussac's only in being graduated\r\n  at 4° C. instead of 15° C., and taking alcohol of density .7939 at\r\n  15.5° C. for pure alcohol instead of .7947 as taken by Gay-Lussac\r\n  (Keene's _Handbook of Hydrometry_).\r\n\r\n  In Beck's hydrometer the zero of the scale corresponds to density\r\n  1.000 and the division 30 to density .850, and equal divisions on the\r\n  scale are continued as far as is required in both directions.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Sike's Hydrometer.]\r\n\r\n  In the centesimal hydrometer of Francoeur the volume of the stem\r\n  between successive divisions of the scale is always (1/100)th of the\r\n  whole volume immersed when the instrument floats in water at 4° C. In\r\n  order to graduate the stem the instrument is first weighed, then\r\n  immersed in distilled water at 4° C., and the line of flotation marked\r\n  zero. The first degree is then found by placing on the top of the stem\r\n  a weight equal to (1/100)th of the weight of the instrument, which\r\n  increases the volume immersed by (1/100)th of the original volume. The\r\n  addition to the top of the stem of successive weights, each (1/100)th\r\n  of the weight of the instrument itself, serves to determine the\r\n  successive degrees. The length of 100 divisions of the scale, or the\r\n  length of the uniform stem the volume of which would be equal to that\r\n  of the hydrometer up to the zero graduation, Francoeur called the\r\n  \"modulus\" of the hydrometer. He constructed his instruments of glass,\r\n  using different instruments for different portions of the scale\r\n  (Francoeur, _Traité d'aréométrie_, Paris, 1842).\r\n\r\n  Dr Boriés of Montpellier constructed a hydrometer which was based upon\r\n  the results of his experiments on mixtures of alcohol and water. The\r\n  interval between the points corresponding to pure alcohol and to pure\r\n  water Boriés divided into 100 equal parts, though the stem was\r\n  prolonged so as to contain only 10 of these divisions, the other 90\r\n  being provided for by the addition of 9 weights to the bottom of the\r\n  instrument as in Clarke's hydrometer.\r\n\r\n  The instrument which has now been exclusively used for revenue\r\n  purposes for nearly a century is that associated with the name of\r\n  Bartholomew Sikes, who was correspondent to the Board of Excise from\r\n  1774 to 1783, and for some time collector of excise for Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\n  Sikes's hydrometer, on account of its similarity to that of Boriés,\r\n  appears to have been borrowed from that instrument. It is made of\r\n  gilded brass or silver, and consists of a spherical ball A (fig. 8),\r\n  1.5 in. in diameter, below which is a weight B connected with the ball\r\n  by a short conical stem C. The stem D is rectangular in section and\r\n  about 3½ in. in length. This is divided into ten equal parts, each of\r\n  which is subdivided into five. As in Boriés's instrument, a series of\r\n  9 weights, each of the form shown at E, serves to extend the scale to\r\n  100 principal divisions. In the centre of each weight is a hole\r\n  capable of admitting the lowest and thickest end of the conical stem\r\n  C, and a slot is cut into it just wide enough to allow the upper part\r\n  of the cone to pass. Each weight can thus be dropped on to the lower\r\n  stem so as to rest on the counterpoise B. The weights are marked 10,\r\n  20, ... 90; and in using the instrument that weight must be selected\r\n  which will allow it to float in the liquid with a portion only of the\r\n  stem submerged. Then the reading of the scale at the line of\r\n  flotation, added to the number on the weight, gives the reading\r\n  required. A small supernumerary weight F is added, which can be placed\r\n  upon the top of the stem. F is so adjusted that when the 60 weight is\r\n  placed on the lower stem the instrument sinks to the same point in\r\n  distilled water when F is attached as in proof spirit when F is\r\n  removed. The best instruments are now constructed for revenue purposes\r\n  of silver, heavily gilded, because it was found that saccharic acid\r\n  contained in some spirits attacked brass behind the gilding.\r\n\r\n  The following table gives the specific gravities corresponding to the\r\n  principal graduations on Sikes's hydrometer at 60° F. and 62° F.,\r\n  together with the corresponding strengths of spirits. The latter are\r\n  based upon the tables of Charles Gilpin, clerk to the Royal Society,\r\n  for which the reader is referred to the _Phil. Trans._ for 1794.\r\n  Gilpin's work is a model for its accuracy and thoroughness of detail,\r\n  and his results have scarcely been improved upon by more recent\r\n  workers. The merit of Sikes's system lies not so much in the\r\n  hydrometer as in the complete system of tables by which the readings\r\n  of the instrument are at once converted into percentage of\r\n  proof-spirit.\r\n\r\n  _Table showing the Densities corresponding to the Indications of\r\n  Sike's Hydrometer._\r\n\r\n    +------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n    |            |

densities are given\r\n  corresponding to each of the degrees 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and\r\n  90, indicating that the successive weights belonging to the particular\r\n  instrument for which the table has been calculated do not quite agree.\r\n  The discrepancy, however, does not produce any sensible error in the\r\n  strength of the corresponding spirit.\r\n\r\n  A table which indicates the weight per gallon of spirituous liquors\r\n  for every degree of Sikes's hydrometer is printed in 23 and 24 Vict.\r\n  c. 114, schedule B. This table differs slightly from that given above,\r\n  which has been abridged from the table given in Keene's _Handbook of\r\n  Hydrometry_, apparently on account of the equal divisions on Sikes's\r\n  scale having been taken as corresponding to equal increments of\r\n  density.\r\n\r\n  Sikes's hydrometer was established for the purpose of collecting the\r\n  revenue of the United Kingdom by Act of Parliament, 56 Geo. III. c.\r\n  140, by which it was enacted that \"all spirits shall be deemed and\r\n  taken to be of the degree of strength which the said hydrometers\r\n  called Sikes's hydrometers shall, upon trial by any officer or\r\n  officers of the customs or excise, denote such spirits to be.\" This\r\n  act came into force on January 5, 1817, and was to have remained in\r\n  force until August 1, 1818, but was repealed by 58 Geo. III. c. 28,\r\n  which established Sikes's hydrometer on a permanent footing. By 3 and\r\n  4 Will. IV. c. 52, § 123, it was further enacted that the same\r\n  instruments and methods should be employed in determining the duty\r\n  upon imported spirits as should in virtue of any Act of Parliament be\r\n  employed in the determination of the duty upon spirits distilled at\r\n  home. It is the practice of the officers of the inland revenue to\r\n  adjust Sikes's hydrometer at 62° F., that being the temperature at\r\n  which the imperial gallon is defined as containing 10 lb. avoirdupois\r\n  of distilled water. The specific gravity of any sample of spirits thus\r\n  determined, when multiplied by ten, gives the weight in pounds per\r\n  imperial gallon, and the weight of any bulk of spirits divided by this\r\n  number gives its volume at once in imperial gallons.\r\n\r\n  Mr (afterwards Colonel) J. B. Keene, of the Hydrometer Office, London,\r\n  has constructed an instrument after the model of Sikes's, but provided\r\n  with twelve weights of different masses but equal volumes, and the\r\n  instrument is never used without having one of these attached. When\r\n  loaded with either of the lightest two weights the instrument is\r\n  specifically lighter than Sikes's hydrometer when unloaded, and it may\r\n  thus be used for specific gravities as low as that of absolute\r\n  alcohol. The volume of each weight being the same, the whole volume\r\n  immersed is always the same when it floats at the same mark whatever\r\n  weight may be attached.\r\n\r\n  Besides the above, many hydrometers have been employed for special\r\n  purposes. Twaddell's hydrometer is adapted for densities greater than\r\n  that of water. The scale is so arranged that the reading multiplied by\r\n  5 and added to 1000 gives the specific gravity with reference to water\r\n  as 1000. To avoid an inconveniently long stem, different instruments\r\n  are employed for different parts of the scale as mentioned above.\r\n\r\n  The lactometer constructed by Dicas of Liverpool is adapted for the\r\n  determination of the quality of milk. It resembles Sikes's hydrometer\r\n  in other respects, but is provided with eight weights. It is also\r\n  provided with a thermometer and slide rule, to reduce the readings to\r\n  the standard temperature of 55° F. Any determination of density can be\r\n  taken only as affording prima facie evidence of the quality of milk,\r\n  as the removal of cream and the addition of water are operations which\r\n  tend to compensate each other in their influence on the density of the\r\n  liquid, so that the lactometer cannot be regarded as a reliable\r\n  instrument.\r\n\r\n  The marine hydrometers, as supplied by the British government to the\r\n  royal navy and the merchant marine, are glass instruments with slender\r\n  stems, and generally serve to indicate specific gravities from 1.000\r\n  to 1.040. Before being issued they are compared with a standard\r\n  instrument, and their errors determined. They are employed for taking\r\n  observations of the density of sea-water.\r\n\r\n  The salinometer is a hydrometer originally intended to indicate the\r\n  strength of the brine in marine boilers in which sea-water is\r\n  employed. Saunders's salinometer consists of a hydrometer which floats\r\n  in a chamber through which the water from the boiler is allowed to\r\n  flow in a gentle stream, at a temperature of 200° F. The peculiarity\r\n  of the instrument consists in the stream of water, as it enters the\r\n  hydrometer chamber, being made to impinge against a disk of metal, by\r\n  which it is broken into drops, thus liberating the steam, which would\r\n  otherwise disturb the instrument.\r\n\r\n  The use of Sikes's hydrometer necessitates the employment of a\r\n  considerable quantity of spirit. For the testing of spirits in bulk no\r\n  more convenient instrument has been devised, but where very small\r\n  quantities are available more suitable laboratory methods must be\r\n  adopted.\r\n\r\n  In England, the Finance Act 1907 (7 Ed. VII. c. 13), section 4,\r\n  provides as follows: (1) The Commissioners of Customs and the\r\n  Commissioners of Inland Revenue may jointly make regulations\r\n  authorizing the use of any means described in the regulations for\r\n  ascertaining for any purpose the strength or weight of spirits. (2)\r\n  Where under any enactment Sykes's (sic) Hydrometer is directed to be\r\n  used or may be used for the purpose of ascertaining the strength or\r\n  weight of spirits, any means so authorized by regulations may be used\r\n  instead of Sykes's Hydrometer and references to Sykes's Hydrometer in\r\n  any enactment shall be construed accordingly. (3) Any regulations made\r\n  under this section shall be published in the London, Edinburgh and\r\n  Dublin Gazette, and shall take effect from the date of publication, or\r\n  such later date as may be mentioned in the regulations for the\r\n  purpose. (4) The expression \"spirits\" in this section has the same\r\n  meaning as in the Spirits Act 1880.     (W. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] In _Nicholson's Journal_, iii. 89, Citizen Eusebe Salverte calls\r\n    attention to the poem \"De Ponderibus et Mensuris\" generally ascribed\r\n    to Rhemnius Fannius Palaemon, and consequently 300 years older than\r\n    Hypatia, in which the hydrometer is described and attributed to\r\n    Archimedes.\r\n\r\n  [2] _Nicholson's Journal_, vol. i. p. 111, footnote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROPATHY, the name given, from the Greek, to the \"water-cure,\" or the\r\ntreatment of disease by water, used outwardly and inwardly. Like many\r\ndescriptive names, the word \"hydropathy\" is defective and even\r\nmisleading, the active agents in the treatment being heat and cold, of\r\nwhich water is little more than the vehicle, and not the only one.\r\nThermotherapeutics (or thermotherapy) is a term less open to objection.\r\n\r\nHydropathy, as a formal system, dates from about 1829, when Vincenz\r\nPriessnitz (1801-1851), a farmer of Gräfenberg in Silesia, Austria,\r\nbegan his public career in the paternal homestead, extended so as to\r\naccommodate the increasing numbers attracted by the fame of his cures.\r\nTwo English works, however, on the medical uses of water had been\r\ntranslated into German in the century preceding the rise of the movement\r\nunder Priessnitz. One of these was by Sir John Floyer (1649-1734), a\r\nphysician of Lichfield, who, struck by the remedial use of certain\r\nsprings by the neighbouring peasantry, investigated the history of cold\r\nbathing, and published in 1702 his [Greek: \"Psychrolousia], _or the\r\nHistory of Cold Bathing, both Ancient and Modern_.\" The book ran through\r\nsix editions within a few years, and the translation was largely drawn\r\nupon by Dr J. S. Hahn of Silesia, in a work published in 1738, _On the\r\nHealing Virtues of Cold Water, Inwardly and Outwardly applied, as proved\r\nby Experience_. The other work was that of Dr James Currie (1756-1805)\r\nof Liverpool, entitled _Medical Reports on the Effects of Water, Cold\r\nand Warm, as a remedy in Fevers and other Diseases_, published in 1797,\r\nand soon after translated into German by Michaelis (1801) and Hegewisch\r\n(1807). It was highly popular, and first placed the subject on a\r\nscientific basis. Hahn's writings had meanwhile created much enthusiasm\r\namong his countrymen, societies having been everywhere formed to promote\r\nthe medicinal and dietetic use of water; and in 1804 Professor Örtel of\r\nAnsbach republished them and quickened the popular movement by\r\nunqualified commendation of water drinking as a remedy for all diseases.\r\nIn him the rising Priessnitz found a zealous advocate, and doubtless an\r\ninstructor also.\r\n\r\nAt Gräfenberg, to which the fame of Priessnitz drew people of every rank\r\nand many countries, medical men were conspicuous by their numbers, some\r\nbeing attracted by curiosity, others by the desire of knowledge, but the\r\nmajority by the hope of cure for ailments which had as yet proved\r\nincurable. Many records of experiences at Gräfenberg were published, all\r\nmore or less favourable to the claims of Priessnitz, and some\r\nenthusiastic in their estimate of his genius and penetration; Captain\r\nClaridge introduced hydropathy into England in 1840, his writings and\r\nlectures, and later those of Sir W. Erasmus Wilson (1809-1884), James\r\nManby Gully (1808-1883) and Edward Johnson, making numerous converts,\r\nand filling the establishments opened soon after at Malvern and\r\nelsewhere. In Germany, France and America hydropathic establishments\r\nmultiplied with great rapidity. Antagonism ran high between the old\r\npractice and the new. Unsparing condemnation was heaped by each on the\r\nother; and a legal prosecution, leading to a royal commission of\r\ninquiry, served but to make Priessnitz and his system stand higher in\r\npublic estimation.\r\n\r\nIncreasing popularity diminished before long that timidity which had in\r\ngreat measure prevented trial of the new method from being made on the\r\nweaker and more serious class of cases, and had caused hydropathists to\r\noccupy themselves mainly with a sturdy order of chronic invalids well\r\nable to bear a rigorous regimen and the severities of unrestricted\r\ncrisis. The need of a radical adaptation to the former class was first\r\nadequately recognized by John Smedley, a manufacturer of Derbyshire,\r\nwho, impressed in his own person with the severities as well as the\r\nbenefits of \"the cold water cure,\" practised among his workpeople a\r\nmilder form of hydropathy, and began about 1852 a new era in its\r\nhistory, founding at Matlock a counterpart of the establishment at\r\nGräfenberg.\r\n\r\nErnst Brand (1826-1897) of Berlin, Räljen and Theodor von Jürgensen of\r\nKiel, and Karl Liebermeister (1833-1901) of Basel, between 1860 and\r\n1870, employed the cooling bath in abdominal typhus with striking\r\nresults, and led to its introduction to England by Dr Wilson Fox. In the\r\nFranco-German war the cooling bath was largely employed, in conjunction\r\nfrequently with quinine; and it now holds a recognized position in the\r\ntreatment of hyperpyrexia. The wet sheet pack has become part of medical\r\npractice; the Turkish bath, introduced by David Urquhart (1805-1877)\r\ninto England on his return from the East, and ardently adopted by Dr\r\nRichard Barter (1802-1870) of Cork, has become a public institution,\r\nand, with the \"morning tub\" and the general practice of water drinking,\r\nis the most noteworthy of the many contributions by hydropathy to public\r\nhealth (see BATHS, ad fin.).\r\n\r\n  The appliances and arrangements by means of which heat and cold are\r\n  brought to bear on the economy are--(a) Packings, hot and cold,\r\n  general and local, sweating and cooling; (b) hot air and steam baths;\r\n  (c) general baths, of hot water and cold; (d) sitz, spinal, head and\r\n  foot baths; (e) bandages (or compresses), wet and dry; also (f)\r\n  fomentations and poultices, hot and cold, sinapisms, stupes, rubbings\r\n  and water potations, hot and cold.\r\n\r\n  (a) Packings.--The full pack consists of a wet sheet enveloping the\r\n  body, with a number of dry blankets packed tightly over it, including\r\n  a macintosh covering or not. In an hour or less these are removed and\r\n  a general bath administered. The pack is a derivative, sedative,\r\n  sudorific and stimulator of cutaneous excretion. There are numerous\r\n  modifications of it, notably the cooling pack, where the wrappings are\r\n  loose and scanty, permitting evaporation, and the application of\r\n  indefinite duration, the sheet being rewetted as it dries; this is of\r\n  great value in protracted febrile conditions. There are also local\r\n  packs, to trunk, limbs or head separately, which are derivative,\r\n  soothing or stimulating, according to circumstance and detail.\r\n\r\n  (b) Hot air baths, the chief of which is the Turkish (properly, the\r\n  Roman) bath, consisting of two or more chambers ranging in temperature\r\n  from 120° to 212° or higher, but mainly used at 150° for curative\r\n  purposes. Exposure is from twenty minutes up to two hours according to\r\n  the effect sought, and is followed by a general bath, and occasionally\r\n  by soaping and shampooing. It is stimulating, derivative, depurative,\r\n  sudorific and alterative, powerfully promoting tissue change by\r\n  increase of the natural waste and repair. It determines the blood to\r\n  the surface, reducing internal congestions, is a potent diaphoretic,\r\n  and, through the extremes of heat and cold, is an effective nervous\r\n  and vascular stimulant and tonic. Morbid growths and secretions, as\r\n  also the uraemic, gouty and rheumatic diathesis, are beneficially\r\n  influenced by it. The full pack and Turkish bath have between them\r\n  usurped the place and bettered the function of the once familiar hot\r\n  bath. The Russian or steam bath and the lamp bath are primitive and\r\n  inferior varieties of the modern Turkish bath, the atmosphere of which\r\n  cannot be too dry and pure.\r\n\r\n  (c) General baths comprise the rain (or needle), spray (or rose),\r\n  shower, shallow, plunge, douche, wave and common morning sponge baths,\r\n  with the dripping sheet, and hot and cold spongings, and are\r\n  combinations, as a rule, of hot and cold water. They are stimulating,\r\n  tonic, derivative and detergent.\r\n\r\n  (d) Local baths comprise the sitz (or sitting), douche (or spouting),\r\n  spinal, foot and head baths, of hot or cold water, singly or in\r\n  combination, successive or alternate. The sitz, head and foot baths\r\n  are used \"flowing\" on occasion. The application of cold by \"Leiter's\r\n  tubes\" is effective for reducing inflammation (e.g. in meningitis and\r\n  in sunstroke); in these a network of metal or indiarubber tubing is\r\n  fitted to the part affected, and cold water kept continuously flowing\r\n  through them. Rapid alternations of hot and cold water have a powerful\r\n  effect in vascular stasis and lethargy of the nervous system and\r\n  absorbents, yielding valuable results in local congestions and chronic\r\n  inflammations.\r\n\r\n  (e) Bandages (or compresses) are of two kinds,--_cooling_, of wet\r\n  material left exposed for evaporation, used in local inflammations and\r\n  fevers; and _heating_, of the same, covered with waterproof material,\r\n  used in congestion, external or internal, for short or long periods.\r\n  Poultices, warm, of bread, linseed, bran, &c., changed but twice in\r\n  twenty-four hours, are identical in action with the heating bandage,\r\n  and superior only in the greater warmth and consequent vital activity\r\n  their closer application to the skin ensures.\r\n\r\n  (f) Fomentations and poultices, hot or cold, sinapisms, stupes,\r\n  rubefacients, irritants, frictions, kneadings, calisthenics,\r\n  gymnastics, electricity, &c., are adjuncts largely employed.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Among the numerous earlier works on hydropathy, the\r\n  following are worth mention: Balbirnie, _Water Cure in Consumption_\r\n  (1847), _Hydropathic Aphorisms_ (1856) and _A Plea for the Turkish\r\n  Bath_ (1862); Beni-Barde, _Traité d'hydrothérapie_ (1874); Claridge,\r\n  _Cold Water Cure, or Hydropathy_ (1841), _Facts and Evidence in\r\n  Support of Hydropathy_ (1843) and _Cold Water, Tepid Water and\r\n  Friction Cure_ (1849); Dunlop, _Philosophy of the Bath_ (1873);\r\n  Floyer, _Psychrolousia, or the History of Cold-Bathing_, &c.

[Greek: Hydor], water, and [Greek: phobos], fear; so\r\ncalled from the symptom of dread of water), or RABIES (Lat. for\r\n\"madness\"), an acute disease, occurring chiefly in certain of the lower\r\nanimals, particularly the canine species, and liable to be communicated\r\nby them to other animals and to man.\r\n\r\n_In Dogs, &c._--The occurrence of rabies in the fox, wolf, hyaena,\r\njackal, raccoon, badger and skunk has been asserted; but there is every\r\nprobability that it is originally a disease of the dog. It is\r\ncommunicated by inoculation to nearly all, if not all, warm-blooded\r\ncreatures. The transmission from one animal to another only certainly\r\ntakes place through inoculation with viruliferous matters. The malady is\r\ngenerally characterized at a certain stage by an irrepressible desire in\r\nthe animal to act offensively with its natural weapons--dogs and other\r\ncarnivora attacking with their teeth, herbivora with their hoofs or\r\nhorns, and birds with their beaks, when excited ever so slightly. In the\r\nabsence of excitement the malady may run its course without any fit of\r\nfury or madness.\r\n\r\n  _Symptoms._--The disease has been divided into three stages or\r\n  periods, and has also been described as appearing in at least two\r\n  forms, according to the peculiarities of the symptoms. But, as a rule,\r\n  one period of the disease does not pass suddenly into another, the\r\n  transition being almost imperceptible; and the forms do not differ\r\n  essentially from each other, but appear merely to constitute varieties\r\n  of the same disease, due to the natural disposition of the animal, or\r\n  other modifying circumstances. These forms have been designated _true_\r\n  or _furious rabies_ (Fr. _rage vrai_; Ger. _rasende Wuth_) and _dumb\r\n  rabies_ (Fr. _rage mue_; Ger. _stille Wuth_).\r\n\r\n  The malady does not commence with fury and madness, but in a strange\r\n  and anomalous change in the habits of the dog: it becomes dull,\r\n  gloomy, and taciturn, and seeks to isolate itself in out-of-the-way\r\n  places, retiring beneath chairs and to odd corners. But in its\r\n  retirement it cannot rest: it is uneasy and fidgety, and no sooner has\r\n  it lain down than suddenly it jumps up in an agitated manner, walks\r\n  backwards and forwards several times, again lies down and assumes a\r\n  sleeping attitude, but has only maintained it for a few minutes when\r\n  it is once more moving about. Again it retires to its corner, to the\r\n  farthest recess it can find, and huddles itself up into a heap, with\r\n  its head concealed beneath its chest and fore-paws. This state of\r\n  continual agitation and inquietude is in striking contrast with its\r\n  ordinary habits, and should therefore receive attention. Not\r\n  unfrequently there are a few moments when the creature appears more\r\n  lively than usual, and displays an extraordinary amount of affection.\r\n  Sometimes there is a disposition to gather up straw, thread, bits of\r\n  wood, &c., which are industriously carried away; a tendency to lick\r\n  anything cold, as iron, stones, &c., is also observed in many\r\n  instances; and there is also a desire evinced to lick other animals.\r\n  Sexual excitement is also frequently an early symptom. At this period\r\n  no disposition to bite is observed; the animal is docile with its\r\n  master and obeys his voice, though not so readily as before, nor with\r\n  the same pleased countenance. There is something strange in the\r\n  expression of its face, and the voice of its owner is scarcely able to\r\n  make it change from a sudden gloominess to its usual animated aspect.\r\n  These symptoms gradually become more marked; the restlessness and\r\n  agitation increase. If on straw the dog scatters and pulls it about\r\n  with its paws, and if in a room it scratches and tumbles the cushions\r\n  or rugs on which it usually lies. It is incessantly on the move,\r\n  rambling about, scratching the ground, sniffing in corners and at the\r\n  doors, as if on the scent or seeking for something. It indulges in\r\n  strange movements, as if affected by some mental influences or a prey\r\n  to hallucinations. When not excited by any external influence it will\r\n  remain for a brief period perfectly still and attentive, as if\r\n  watching something, or following the movements of some creature on the\r\n  wall; then it will suddenly dart forward and snap at the vacant air,\r\n  as if pursuing an annoying object, or endeavouring to seize a fly. At\r\n  another time it throws itself, yelling and furious, against the wall,\r\n  as if it heard threatening voices on the other side, or was bent on\r\n  attacking an enemy. Nevertheless, the animal is still docile and\r\n  submissive, for its master's voice will bring it out of its frenzy.\r\n  But the saliva is already virulent, and the excessive affection which\r\n  it evinces at intervals, by licking the hands or face of those it\r\n  loves, renders the danger very great should there be a wound or\r\n  abrasion. Until a late period in the disease the master's voice has a\r\n  powerful influence over the animal. When it has escaped from all\r\n  control and wanders erratically abroad, ferocious and restless, and\r\n  haunted by horrid phantoms, the familiar voice yet exerts its\r\n  influence, and it is rare indeed that it attacks its master.\r\n\r\n  There is no dread of water in the rabid dog; the animal is generally\r\n  thirsty, and if water be offered will lap it with avidity, and swallow\r\n  it at the commencement of the disease. And when, at a later period,\r\n  the constriction about the throat--symptomatic of the disease--renders\r\n  swallowing difficult, the dog will none the less endeavour to drink,\r\n  and the lappings are as frequent and prolonged when deglutition\r\n  becomes impossible. So little dread has the rabid dog of water that it\r\n  will ford streams and swim rivers; and when in the ferocious stage it\r\n  will even do this in order to attack other creatures on the opposite\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n  At the commencement of the disease the dog does not usually refuse to\r\n  eat, and some animals are voracious to an unusual degree. But in a\r\n  short time it becomes fastidious, only eating what it usually has a\r\n  special predilection for. Soon, however, this gives place to a most\r\n  characteristic symptom--either the taste becomes extremely depraved or\r\n  the dog has a fatal and imperious desire to bite and ingest\r\n  everything. The litter of its kennel, wool from cushions, carpets,\r\n  stockings, slippers, wood, grass, earth, stones, glass, horse-dung,\r\n  even its own faeces and urine, or whatever else may come in its way,\r\n  are devoured. On examination of the body of a dog which has died of\r\n  rabies it is so common to find in the stomach a quantity of dissimilar\r\n  and strange matters on which the teeth have been exercised that, if\r\n  there was nothing known of the animal's history, there would be strong\r\n  evidence of its having been affected with the disease. When a dog,\r\n  then, is observed to gnaw and eat suchlike matters, though it exhibits\r\n  no tendency to bite, it should be suspected.\r\n\r\n  The mad dog does not usually foam at the mouth to any great extent at\r\n  first. The mucus of the mouth is not much increased in quantity, but\r\n  it soon becomes thicker, viscid, and glutinous, and adheres to the\r\n  angles of the mouth, fauces and teeth. It is at this period that the\r\n  thirst is most ardent, and the dog sometimes furiously attempts to\r\n  detach the saliva with its paws; and if after a while it loses its\r\n  balance in these attempts and tumbles over, there can no longer be any\r\n  doubt as to the nature of the malady. There is another symptom\r\n  connected with the mouth in that form of the disease named \"dumb\r\n  madness\" which has frequently proved deceptive. The lower jaw drops in\r\n  consequence of paralysis of its muscles, and the mouth remains open.\r\n  The interior is dry from the air passing continually over it, and\r\n  assumes a deep red tint, somewhat masked by patches of dust or earth,\r\n  which more especially adhere to the upper surface of the tongue and to\r\n  the lips. The strange alteration produced in the dog's physiognomy by\r\n  its constantly open mouth and the dark colour of the interior is\r\n  rendered still more characteristic by the dull, sad, or dead\r\n  expression of the animal's eyes. In this condition the creature is not\r\n  very dangerous, because generally it could not bite if it\r\n  tried--indeed there does not appear to be much desire to bite in dumb\r\n  madness; but the saliva is none the less virulent, and accidental\r\n  inoculations with it, through imprudent handling, will prove as fatal\r\n  as in the furious form. The mouth should not be touched,--numerous\r\n  deaths having occurred through people thinking the dog had some\r\n  foreign substance lodged in its throat, and thrusting their fingers\r\n  down to remove it. The sensation of tightness which seems to exist at\r\n  the throat causes the dog to act as if a bone were fixed between its\r\n  teeth or towards the back of its mouth, and to employ its fore-paws as\r\n  if to dislodge it. This is a very deceptive symptom, and may prove\r\n  equally dangerous if caution be not observed. Vomiting of blood or a\r\n  chocolate-coloured fluid is witnessed in some cases, and has been\r\n  supposed to be due to the foreign substances in the stomach, which\r\n  abrade the lining membrane; this, however, is not correct, as it has\r\n  been observed in man.\r\n\r\n  The voice of the rabid dog is very peculiar, and so characteristic\r\n  that to those acquainted with it nothing more is needed to prove the\r\n  presence of the disease. Those who have heard it once or twice never\r\n  forget its signification. Owing to the alterations taking place in the\r\n  larynx the voice becomes hoarse, cracked and stridulous, like that of\r\n  a child affected with croup--the \"voix du coq,\" as the French have it.\r\n  A preliminary bark is made in a somewhat elevated tone and with open\r\n  mouth; this is immediately succeeded by five, six or eight decreasing\r\n  howls, emitted when the animal is sitting or standing, and always with\r\n  the nose elevated, which seem to come from the depths of the throat,\r\n  the jaws not coming together and closing the mouth during such\r\n  emission, as in the healthy bark. This alteration in the voice is\r\n  frequently the first observable indication of the malady, and should\r\n  at once attract attention. In dumb madness the voice is frequently\r\n  lost from the very commencement--hence the designation.\r\n\r\n  The sensibility of the mad dog appears to be considerably diminished,\r\n  and the animal appears to have lost the faculty of expressing the\r\n  sensations it experiences: it is mute under the infliction of pain,\r\n  though there can be no doubt that it still has peripheral sensation to\r\n  some extent. Burning, beating and wounding produce much less effect\r\n  than in health, and the animal will even mutilate itself with its\r\n  teeth. Suspicion, therefore, should always strongly attach to a dog\r\n  which does not manifest a certain susceptibility to painful\r\n  impressions and receives punishment without any cry or complaint.\r\n  There is also reason for apprehension when a dog bites itself\r\n  persistently in any part of its body. A rabid dog is usually stirred\r\n  to fury at the sight of one of its own species; this test has been\r\n  resorted to by Henrie Marie Bouley (1814-1885) to dissipate doubts as\r\n  to the existence of the disease when the diagnosis is otherwise\r\n  uncertain. As soon as the suspected animal, if it is really rabid,\r\n  finds itself in the presence of another of its species it at once\r\n  assumes the aggressive, and, if allowed, will bite furiously. All\r\n  rabid animals indeed become excited, exasperated, and furious at the\r\n  sight of a dog, and attack it with their natural weapons, even the\r\n  timid sheep when rabid butts furiously at the enemy before which in\r\n  health it would have fled in terror. This inversion of sentiment is\r\n  sometimes valuable in diagnosing the malady; it is so common that it\r\n  may be said to be present in every case of rabies. When, therefore, a\r\n  dog, contrary to its habits and natural inclination, becomes suddenly\r\n  aggressive to other dogs, it is time to take precautions.\r\n\r\n  In the large majority of instances the dog is inoffensive in the early\r\n  period of the disease to those to whom it is familiar. It then flies\r\n  from its home and either dies, is killed as \"mad,\" or returns in a\r\n  miserable plight, and in an advanced stage of the malady, when the\r\n  desire to bite is irresistible. It is in the early stage that\r\n  sequestration and suppressive measures are most valuable. The dogs\r\n  which propagate the disease are usually those that have escaped from\r\n  their owners. After two or three days, frequently in about twelve\r\n  hours, more serious and alarming symptoms appear, ferocious instincts\r\n  are developed, and the desire to do injury is irrepressible. The\r\n  animal has an indefinable expression of sombre melancholy and cruelty.\r\n  The eyes have their pupils dilated, and emit flashes of light when\r\n  they are not dull and heavy; they always appear so fierce as to\r\n  produce terror in the beholder; they are red, and their sensibility to\r\n  light is increased; and wrinkles, which sometimes appear on the\r\n  forehead, add to the repulsive aspect of the animal. If caged it flies\r\n  at the spectator, emitting its characteristic howl or bark, and\r\n  seizing the iron bars with its teeth, and if a stick be thrust before\r\n  it this is grasped and gnawed. This fury is soon succeeded by\r\n  lassitude, when the animal remains insensible to every excitement.\r\n  Then all at once it rouses up again, and another paroxysm of fury\r\n  commences. The first paroxysm is usually the most intense, and the\r\n  fits vary in duration from some hours to a day, and even longer; they\r\n  are ordinarily briefer in trained and pet dogs than in those which are\r\n  less domesticated, but in all the remission is so complete after the\r\n  first paroxysm that the animals appear to be almost well, if not in\r\n  perfect health. During the paroxysms respiration is hurried and\r\n  laboured, but tranquil during the remissions. There is an increase of\r\n  temperature, and the pulse is quick and hard. When the animal is kept\r\n  in a dark place and not excited, the fits of fury are not observed.\r\n  Sometimes it is agitated and restless in the manner already described.\r\n  It never becomes really furious or aggressive unless excited by\r\n  external objects--the most potent of these, as has been said, being\r\n  another dog, which, however, if it be admitted to its cage, it may not\r\n  at once attack. The attacked animal rarely retaliates, but usually\r\n  responds to the bites by acute yells, which contrast strangely with\r\n  the silent anger of the aggressor, and tries to hide its head with its\r\n  paws or beneath the straw. These repeated paroxysms hurry the course\r\n  of the disease. The secretion and flowing of a large quantity of\r\n  saliva from the mouth are usually only witnessed in cases in which\r\n  swallowing has become impossible, the mouth being generally dry. At\r\n  times the tongue, nose and whole head appear swollen. Other dogs\r\n  frequently shun one which is rabid, as if aware of their danger.\r\n\r\n  The rabid dog, if lodged in a room or kept in a house, is continually\r\n  endeavouring to escape; and when it makes its escape it goes freely\r\n  forward, as if impelled by some irresistible force. It travels\r\n  considerable distances in a short time, perhaps attacking every living\r\n  creature it meets--preferring dogs, however, to other animals, and\r\n  these to mankind; cats, sheep, cattle and horses are particularly\r\n  liable to be injured. It attacks in silence, and never utters a snarl\r\n  or a cry of anger; should it chance to be hurt in return it emits no\r\n  cry or howl of pain. The degree of ferocity appears to be related to\r\n  natural disposition and training. Some dogs, for instance, will only\r\n  snap or give a slight bite in passing, while others will bite\r\n  furiously, tearing the objects presented to them, or which they meet\r\n  in their way, and sometimes with such violence as to injure their\r\n  mouth and break their teeth, or even their jaws. If chained, they will\r\n  in some cases gnaw the chain until their teeth are worn away and the\r\n  bones laid bare. The rabid dog does not continue its progress very\r\n  long. Exhausted by fatigue and the paroxysms of madness excited in it\r\n  by the objects it meets, as well as by hunger, thirst, and also, no\r\n  doubt, by the malady, its limbs soon become feeble; the rate of\r\n  travelling is lessened and the walk is unsteady, while its drooping\r\n  tall, head inclined towards the ground, open mouth, and protruded\r\n  tongue (of a leaden colour or covered with dust) give the distressed\r\n  creature a very striking and characteristic physiognomy. In this\r\n  condition, however, it is much less to be dreaded than in its early\r\n  fits of fury, since it is no longer capable or desirous of altering\r\n  its course or going out of its way to attack an animal or a man not\r\n  immediately in the path. It is very probable that its fast-failing\r\n  vision, deadened scent, and generally diminished perception prevent\r\n  its being so readily impressed or excited by surrounding objects as it\r\n  previously was. To each paroxysm, which is always of short duration,\r\n  there succeeds a degree of exhaustion as great as the fits have been\r\n  violent and oft repeated. This compels the animal to stop; then it\r\n  shelters itself in obscure places--frequently in ditches by the\r\n  roadside--and lies there in a somnolescent state for perhaps hours.\r\n  There is great danger, nevertheless, in disturbing the dog at this\r\n  period; for when roused from its torpor it has sometimes sufficient\r\n  strength to inflict a bite. This period, which may be termed the\r\n  second stage, is as variable in its duration as the first, but it\r\n  rarely exceeds three or four days. The above-described phenomena\r\n  gradually merge into those of the third or last period, when symptoms\r\n  of paralysis appear, which are speedily followed by death. During the\r\n  remission in the paroxysms these paralytic symptoms are more\r\n  particularly manifested in the hind limbs, which appear as if unable\r\n  to support the animal's weight, and cause it to stagger about; or the\r\n  lower jaw becomes more or less drooping, leaving the parched mouth\r\n  partially open. Emaciation rapidly sets in, and the paroxysms diminish\r\n  in intensity, while the remissions become less marked. The physiognomy\r\n  assumes a still more sinister and repulsive aspect; the hair is dull\r\n  and erect; the flanks are retracted; the eyes lose their lustre and\r\n  are buried in the orbits, the pupil being dilated, and the cornea dull\r\n  and semi-opaque; very often, even at an early period, the eyes squint,\r\n  and this adds still more to the terrifying appearance of the poor dog.\r\n  The voice, if at all heard, is husky, the breathing laborious, and the\r\n  pulse hurried and irregular. Gradually the paralysis increases, and\r\n  the posterior extremities are dragged as if the animal's back were\r\n  broken, until at length it becomes general; it is then the prelude to\r\n  death. Or the dog remains lying in a state of stupor, and can only\r\n  raise itself with difficulty on the fore-limbs when greatly excited.\r\n  In this condition it may yet endeavour to bite at objects within its\r\n  reach. At times convulsions of a tetanic character appear in certain\r\n  muscles; at other times these are general. A comatose condition\r\n  ensues, and the rabid dog, if permitted to die naturally, perishes, in\r\n  the great majority of cases, from paralysis and asphyxia.\r\n\r\n  In dumb madness there is paralysis of the lower jaw, which imparts a\r\n  curious and very characteristic physiognomy to the dog; the voice is\r\n  also lost, and the animal can neither eat nor drink. In this condition\r\n  the creature remains with its jaw pendent and the mouth consequently\r\n  wide open, showing the flaccid or swollen tongue covered with brownish\r\n  matter, and a stringy gelatinous-looking saliva lying between it and\r\n  the lower lip and coating the fauces, which sometimes appear to be\r\n  inflamed. Though the animal is unable to swallow fluids, the desire to\r\n  drink is nevertheless intense; for the creature will thrust its face\r\n  into the vessel of water in futile attempts to obtain relief, even\r\n  until the approach of death. Water may be poured down its throat\r\n  without inducing a paroxysm. The general physiognomy and demeanour of\r\n  the poor creature inspire the beholder with pity rather than fear. The\r\n  symptoms due to cerebral excitement are less marked than in the\r\n  furious form of the disease; the agitation is not so considerable, and\r\n  the restlessness, tendency to run away, and desire to bite are nearly\r\n  absent; generally the animal is quite passive. Not unfrequently one or\r\n  both eyes squint, and it is only when very much excited that the dog\r\n  may contrive to close its mouth. Sometimes there is swelling about the\r\n  pharynx and the neck; when the tongue shares in this complication it\r\n  hangs out of the mouth. In certain cases there is a catarrhal\r\n  condition of the membrane lining the nasal cavities, larynx, and\r\n  bronchi; sometimes the animal testifies to the existence of abdominal\r\n  pain, and the faeces are then soft or fluid. The other symptoms--such\r\n  as the rapid exhaustion and emaciation, paralysis of the posterior\r\n  limbs towards the termination of the disease, as well as the rapidity\r\n  with which it runs its course--are the same as in the furious form.\r\n\r\n  The simultaneous occurrence of furious and dumb madness has frequently\r\n  been observed in packs of fox-hounds. Dumb madness differs, then, from\r\n  the furious type in the paralysis of the lower jaw, which hinders the\r\n  dog from biting, save in very exceptional circumstances; the ferocious\r\n  instincts are also in abeyance; and there is no tendency to\r\n  aggression. It has been calculated that from 15 to 20% of rabid dogs\r\n  have this particular form of the disease. Puppies and young dogs\r\n  chiefly have furious rabies.\r\n\r\n  These are the symptoms of rabies in the dog; but it is not likely, nor\r\n  is it necessary, that they will all be present in every case. In other\r\n  species the symptoms differ more or less from those manifested by the\r\n  dog, but they are generally marked by a change in the manner and\r\n  habits of the creatures affected, with strong indications of nervous\r\n  disturbance, in the majority of species amounting to ferociousness and\r\n  a desire to injure, timid creatures becoming bold and aggressive.\r\n\r\n_In Human Beings._--The disease of hydrophobia has been known from early\r\ntimes, and is alluded to in the works of Aristotle, Xenophon, Plutarch,\r\nVirgil, Horace, Ovid and many others, as well as in those of the early\r\nwriters on medicine. Celsus gives detailed instructions respecting the\r\ntreatment of men who have been bitten by rabid dogs, and dwells on the\r\ndangers attending such wounds. After recommending suction of the bitten\r\npart by means of a dry cupping glass, and thereafter the application of\r\nthe actual cautery or of strong caustics, and the employment of baths\r\nand various internal remedies, he says: \"Idque cum ita per triduum\r\nfactum est, tutus esse homo a periculo videtur. Solet autem ex eo\r\nvulnere, ubi parum occursum est, aquae timor nasci, [Greek:\r\nhydrophobian] Graeci appellant. Miserrimum genus morbi; in quo simul\r\naeger et siti et aquae metu cruciatur; quo oppressis in angusto spes\r\nest.\" Subsequently Galen described minutely the phenomena of\r\nhydrophobia, and recommended the excision of the wounded part as a\r\nprotection against the disease. Throughout many succeeding centuries\r\nlittle or nothing was added to the facts which the early physicians had\r\nmade known upon the subject. The malady was regarded with universal\r\nhorror and dread, and the unfortunate sufferers were generally abandoned\r\nby all around them and left to their terrible fate. In later times the\r\ninvestigations of Boerhaave, Gerard van Swieten (1700-1772), John\r\nHunter, François Magendie (1783-1855), Gilbert Breschet (1784-1845),\r\nVirchow, Albert Reder, as also of William Youatt (1776-1847), George\r\nFleming, Meynell, Karl Hertwig (1798-1881), and others, have furnished\r\nimportant information; but all these were put into the shade by the\r\nresearches of Pasteur.\r\n\r\nThe disease is communicated by the secretions of the mouth of the\r\naffected animal entering a wound or abrasion of the human skin or mucous\r\nmembrane. In the great majority of cases (90%) this is due to the bite\r\nof a rabid dog, but bites of rabid cats, wolves, foxes, jackals, &c. are\r\noccasionally the means of conveying the disease. Numerous popular\r\nfallacies still prevail on the subject of hydrophobia. Thus it is\r\nsupposed that the bite of an angry dog may produce the disease, and all\r\nthe more if the animal should subsequently develop symptoms of rabies.\r\nThe ground for this erroneous notion is the fact, which is\r\nunquestionable, that animals in whom rabies is in the stage of\r\nincubation, during which there are few if any symptoms, may by their\r\nbites convey the disease, though fortunately during this early stage\r\nthey are little disposed to bite. The bite of a non-rabid animal,\r\nhowever enraged, cannot give rise to hydrophobia.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation of the disease, or that time which elapses\r\nbetween the introduction of the virus and the development of the\r\nsymptoms, appears to vary in a remarkable degree, being in some cases as\r\nshort as a fortnight, and in others as long as several months or even\r\nyears. On an average it seems to be from about six weeks to three\r\nmonths, but it mainly depends on the part bitten; bites on the head are\r\nthe most dangerous. The incubation period is also said to be shorter in\r\nchildren. The rare instances of the appearance of hydrophobia many years\r\nafter the introduction of the poison are always more or less open to\r\nquestion as to subsequent inoculation.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease is about to declare itself it not unfrequently happens\r\nthat the wound, which had quickly and entirely healed after the bite,\r\nbegins to exhibit evidence of irritation or inflammatory action, or at\r\nleast to be the seat of morbid sensations such as numbness, tingling or\r\nitching. The symptoms characterizing the premonitory stage are great\r\nmental depression and disquietude, together with restlessness and a kind\r\nof indefinite fear. There is an unusual tendency to talk, and the\r\narticulation is abrupt and rapid. Although in some instances the\r\npatients will not acknowledge that they have been previously bitten, and\r\ndeny it with great obstinacy, yet generally they are well aware of the\r\nnature of their malady, and speak despairingly of its consequences.\r\nThere is in this early stage a certain amount of constitutional\r\ndisturbance showing itself by feverishness, loss of appetite,\r\nsleeplessness, headache, great nervous excitability, respiration of a\r\npeculiar sighing or sobbing character, and even occasionally a\r\nnoticeable aversion to liquids. These symptoms--constituting what is\r\ntermed the melancholic stage--continue in general for one or two days,\r\nwhen they are succeeded by the stage of excitement in which all the\r\ncharacteristic phenomena of the malady are fully developed. Sometimes\r\nthe disease first shows itself in this stage, without antecedent\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nThe agitation of the sufferer now becomes greatly increased, and the\r\ncountenance exhibits anxiety and terror. There is noticed a marked\r\nembarrassment of the breathing, but the most striking and terrible\r\nfeatures of this stage are the effects produced by attempts to swallow\r\nfluids. The patient suffers from thirst and desires eagerly to drink,\r\nbut on making the effort is seized with a most violent suffocative\r\nparoxysm produced by spasm of the muscles of swallowing and breathing,\r\nwhich continues for several seconds, and is succeeded by a feeling of\r\nintense alarm and distress. With great caution and determination the\r\nattempt is renewed, but only to be followed with a repetition of the\r\nseizure, until the unhappy sufferer ceases from sheer dread to try to\r\nquench the thirst which torments him. Indeed the very thought of doing\r\nso suffices to bring on a choking paroxysm, as does also the sound of\r\nthe running of water. The patient is extremely sensitive to any kind of\r\nexternal impression; a bright light, a loud noise, a breath of cool air,\r\ncontact with any one, are all apt to bring on one of these seizures. But\r\nbesides these suffocative attacks there also occur general convulsions\r\naffecting the whole muscular system of the body, and occasionally a\r\ncondition of tetanic spasm. These various paroxysms increase in\r\nfrequency and severity with the advance of the disease, but alternate\r\nwith intervals of comparative quiet, in which, however, there is intense\r\nanxiety and more or less constant difficulty of breathing, accompanied\r\nwith a peculiar sonorous expiration, which has suggested the notion that\r\nthe patient barks like a dog. In many instances there is great mental\r\ndisturbance, with fits of maniacal excitement, in which he strikes at\r\nevery one about him, and accuses them of being the cause of his\r\nsufferings--these attacks being succeeded by calm intervals in which he\r\nexpresses great regret for his violent behaviour. During all this stage\r\nof the disease the patient is tormented with a viscid secretion\r\naccumulating in his mouth, which from dread of swallowing he is\r\nconstantly spitting about him. There may also be noticed snapping\r\nmovements of the jaws as if he were attempting to bite, but these are in\r\nreality a manifestation of the spasmodic action which affects the\r\nmuscles generally. There is no great amount of fever, but there is\r\nconstipation, diminished flow of urine, and often sexual excitement.\r\n\r\nAfter two or three days of suffering of the most terrible description\r\nthe patient succumbs, death taking place either in a paroxysm of\r\nchoking, or on the other hand in a tranquil manner from exhaustion, all\r\nthe symptoms having abated, and the power of swallowing returned before\r\nthe end. The duration of the disease from the first declaration of the\r\nsymptoms is generally from three to five days.\r\n\r\nApart from the inoculation method (see below), the treatment of most\r\navail is that which is directed towards preventing the absorption of the\r\npoison into the system. This may be accomplished by excision of the part\r\ninvolved in the bite of the rabid animal, or, where this from its\r\nlocality is impracticable, in the application to the wound of some\r\nchemical agent which will destroy the activity of the virus, such as\r\npotassa fusa, lunar caustic (nitrate of silver), or the actual cautery\r\nin the form of a red-hot wire. The part should be thoroughly acted on by\r\nthese agents, no matter what amount of temporary suffering this may\r\noccasion. Such applications should be resorted to immediately after the\r\nbite has been inflicted, or as soon thereafter as possible. Further,\r\neven though many hours or days should elapse, these local remedies\r\nshould still be applied; for if, as appears probable, some at least of\r\nthe virus remains for long at the injured part, the removal or effectual\r\ndestruction of this may prevent the dread consequences of its\r\nabsorption. Every effort should be made to tranquillize and reassure the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nTwo special points of interest have arisen in recent years in connexion\r\nwith this disease. One is the Pasteur treatment by inoculation with\r\nrabic virus (see also PARASITIC DISEASES), and the other was the attempt\r\nof the government to exterminate rabies in the British Isles by muzzling\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pasteur treatment.\r\n\r\nThe Pasteur treatment was first applied to human beings in 1885 after\r\nprolonged investigation and experimental trial on animals. It is based\r\non the fact that a virus, capable of giving rabies by inoculation, can\r\nbe extracted from the tissues of a rabid animal and then intensified or\r\nattenuated at pleasure. It appears that the strength of the rabic virus,\r\nas determined by inoculation, is constant in the same species of animal,\r\nbut is modified by passing through another species. For instance, the\r\nnatural virus of dogs is always of the same strength, but when\r\ninoculated into monkeys it becomes weakened, and the process of\r\nattenuation can be carried on by passing the virus through a succession\r\nof monkeys, until it loses the power of causing death. If this weakened\r\nvirus is then passed back through guinea-pigs, dogs or rabbits, it\r\nregains its former strength. Again, if it be passed through a succession\r\nof dogs it becomes intensified up to a maximum of strength which is\r\ncalled the _virus fixe_. Pasteur further discovered that the strength\r\ncan be modified by temperature and by keeping the dried tissues of a\r\nrabid animal containing the virus. Thus, if the spinal cord of a rabid\r\ndog be preserved in a dry state, the virus loses strength day by day.\r\nThe system of treatment consists in making an emulsion of the cord and\r\ngraduating the strength of the dose by using a succession of cords,\r\nwhich have been kept for a progressively diminishing length of time.\r\nThose which have been kept for fourteen days are used as a\r\nstarting-point, yielding virus of a minimum strength. They are followed\r\nby preparations of diminishing age and increasing strength, day by day,\r\nup to the maximum, which is three days old. These are successively\r\ninjected into the circulatory system. The principle is the artificial\r\nacquisition by the patient of resistance to the rabic virus, which is\r\npresumed to be already in the system but has not yet become active, by\r\naccustoming him gradually to its toxic effect, beginning with a weak\r\nform and progressively increasing the dose. It is not exactly treatment\r\nof the disease, because it is useless or nearly so when the disease has\r\ncommenced, nor is it exactly preventive, for the patient has already\r\nbeen bitten. It must be regarded as a kind of anticipatory cure. The\r\ncords are cut into sections and preserved dry in sterilized flasks\r\nplugged with cotton-wool. Another method of preparing the inoculatory\r\nvirus, which has been devised by Guido Tizzoni and Eugenio Centanni,\r\nconsists in subjecting the _virus fixe_ to peptic digestion by diluted\r\ngastric juice for varying periods of time.\r\n\r\nThe first patient was treated by Pasteur's system in July 1885. He was\r\nsuccessively inoculated with emulsions made from cords that had been\r\nkept fourteen and ten days, then eleven and eight days, then eight,\r\nseven, six days, and so on. Two forms of treatment are now used--(1) the\r\n\"simple,\" in which the course from weak to strong virus is extended over\r\nnine days; (2) the \"intensive,\" in which the maximum is reached in seven\r\ndays. The latter is used in cases of very bad bites and those of some\r\nstanding, in which it is desirable to lose no time. Two days are\r\ncompressed into one at the commencement by making injections morning and\r\nevening instead of once a day, so that the fifth-day cord is reached in\r\nfour days instead of six, as in the \"simple\" treatment. When the\r\nmaximum--the third-day cord--is reached the injections are continued\r\nwith fifth-, fourth-, and third-day cords. The whole course is fifteen\r\ndays in the simple treatment and twenty-one in the intensive. The doses\r\ninjected range from 1 to 3 cubic centimetres. Injections are made\r\nalternately into the right and left flanks. The following table shows\r\nthe number treated from 1886 to 1905, with the mortality.\r\n\r\n  +------+--------+-------+---------+\r\n  | Year.|Patients|Deaths.|Mortality|\r\n  |      |Treated.|       |per cent.|\r\n  +------+--------+-------+---------+\r\n  | 1886 |  2671  |  25   |   .94   |\r\n  | 1887 |  1770  |  14   |   .79   |\r\n  | 1888 |  1622  |   9   |   .55   |\r\n  | 1889 |  1830  |   7   |   .38   |\r\n  | 1890 |  1540  |   5   |   .32   |\r\n  | 1891 |  1559  |   4   |   .25   |\r\n  | 1892 |  1790  |   4   |   .22   |\r\n  | 1893 |  1648  |   6   |   .36   |\r\n  | 1894 |  1387  |   7   |   .50   |\r\n  | 1895 |  1520  |   5   |   .33   |\r\n  | 1896 |  1308  |   4   |   .30   |\r\n  | 1897 |  1521  |   6   |   .39   |\r\n  | 1898 |  1465  |   3   |   .20   |\r\n  | 1899 |  1614  |   4   |   .25   |\r\n  | 1900 |  1419  |  10   |   .70   |\r\n  | 1901 |  1318  |   5   |   .37   |\r\n  | 1902 |  1105  |   2   |   .18   |\r\n  | 1903 |   630  |   4   |   .65   |\r\n  | 1904 |   757  |   5   |   .66   |\r\n  | 1905 |   727  |   4   |   .54   |\r\n  +------+--------+-------+---------+\r\n\r\nThese figures do not include cases which develop hydrophobia during\r\ntreatment or within fifteen days after treatment is completed, for it is\r\nheld that persons who die within that period have their nervous centres\r\ninvaded by virus before the cure has time to act. The true mortality\r\nshould therefore be considerably higher. For instance, in 1898 three\r\ndeaths came within this category, which just doubles the mortality; and\r\nin 1899 the additional deaths were six, bringing the mortality up to\r\ntwo-and-a-half times that indicated in the table. When, however, the\r\nadditional deaths are included the results remain sufficiently striking,\r\nif two assumptions are granted--(1) that all the persons treated have\r\nbeen bitten by rabid animals; (2) that a large proportion of persons so\r\nbitten usually have hydrophobia. Unfortunately, both these assumptions\r\nlack proof, and therefore the evidence of the efficacy of the treatment\r\ncannot be said to satisfy a strictly scientific standard. With regard to\r\nthe first point, the patients are divided into three categories--(1)\r\nthose bitten by an animal the rabidity of which is proved by the\r\ndevelopment of rabies in other animals bitten by it or inoculated from\r\nits spinal cord; (2) those bitten by an animal pronounced rabid on a\r\nveterinary examination; (3) those bitten by an animal suspected of being\r\nrabid. The number of patients in each category in 1898 was (1) 141, (2)\r\n855, (3) 469; and in 1899 it was (1) 152, (2) 1099, (3) 363. As might be\r\nexpected, the vast majority came under the second and third heads, in\r\nwhich the evidence of rabidity is doubtful or altogether lacking. With\r\nregard to the second point, the proportion of persons bitten by rabid\r\nanimals who ordinarily develop hydrophobia has only been \"estimated\"\r\nfrom very inadequate data. Otto Bollinger from a series of collected\r\nstatistics states that before the introduction of the Pasteur treatment,\r\nof patients bitten by dogs undoubtedly rabid 47% died, the rate being\r\n33% in those whose wounds had been cauterized and 83% when there had\r\nbeen no local treatment. If the number of rabid dogs be compared with\r\nthe deaths from hydrophobia in any year or series of years, it can\r\nhardly be very high. For instance, in 1895, 668 dogs, besides other\r\nanimals, were killed and certified to be rabid in England, and the\r\ndeaths from hydrophobia were twenty. Of course this proves nothing, as\r\nthe number of persons bitten is not known, but the difference between\r\nthe amount of rabies and of hydrophobia is suggestively great in view of\r\nthe marked propensity of rabid dogs to bite, nor is it accounted for by\r\nthe fact that some of the persons bitten were treated at the Institut\r\nPasteur. A comparison of the annual mortality from hydrophobia in France\r\nbefore and after the introduction of the treatment would afford decisive\r\nevidence as to its efficacy; but unfortunately no such comparison can be\r\nmade for lack of vital statistics in that country. The experience of the\r\nParis hospitals, however, points to a decided diminution of mortality.\r\nOn the whole it must be said, in the absence of further data, that the\r\nPasteur treatment certainly diminishes the danger of hydrophobia from\r\nthe bites of rabid animals.\r\n\r\nMore recently treatment with an anti-rabic serum has been suggested (see\r\nPARASITIC DISEASES). Victor Babes and Lepp and later Guido Tizzoni and\r\nEugenio Centanni have worked out a method of serum treatment curative\r\nand protective. In this method not the rabic poison itself, as in the\r\nPasteur treatment, but the protective substance formed is injected into\r\nthe tissues. The serum of a vaccinated animal is capable of neutralizing\r\nthe power of the virus of rabies not only when mixed with the virus\r\nbefore injection but even when injected simultaneously or within\r\ntwenty-four hours after the introduction of the virus. These authors\r\nshowed that the serum of a rabbit protects a rabbit better than does the\r\nserum of a dog, and vice versa. At the end of twenty days' injections\r\nthey found they could obtain such a large quantity of anti-rabic\r\nsubstance in the serum of an animal, that even 1 part of serum to 25,000\r\nof the body weight would protect an animal. This process differs from\r\nthat of Pasteur in so far as that in place of promoting the formation of\r\nthe antidote within the body of the patient, by a process of vaccination\r\nwith progressively stronger and stronger virus, this part of the process\r\nis carried on in an animal, Babes using the dog and Centanni the sheep,\r\nthe blood serum of which is injected. This method of vaccination is\r\nuseful as a protective to those in charge of kennels.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Muzzling order in England.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to stamp out rabies in Great Britain was an experiment\r\nundertaken by the government in the public interest. The principal means\r\nadopted were the muzzling of dogs in infected areas, and prolonged\r\nquarantine for imported animals. The efficacy of dog-muzzling in\r\nchecking the spread of rabies and diminishing its prevalence has been\r\nrepeatedly proved in various countries. Liable as other animals may be\r\nto the disease, in England at least the dog is pre-eminently the vehicle\r\nof contagion and the great source of danger to human beings. There is a\r\ndifference of opinion on the way in which muzzling acts, though there\r\ncan be none as to the effect it produces in reducing rabies. Probably it\r\nacts rather by securing the destruction of ownerless and stray--which\r\ngenerally includes rabid--dogs than by preventing biting; for though it\r\nmay prevent snapping, even the wire-cage muzzle does not prevent furious\r\ndogs from biting, and it is healthy, not rabid, dogs that wear the\r\nmuzzle. It has therefore been suggested that a collar would have the\r\nsame effect, if all collarless dogs were seized; but the evidence goes\r\nto show that it has not, perhaps because rabid dogs are more likely to\r\nstray from home with their collars, which are constantly worn, than with\r\nmuzzles which are not, and so escape seizure. Moreover, it is much\r\neasier for the police to see whether a dog is wearing a muzzle or not\r\nthan it is to make sure about the collar. However this may be, the\r\nmuzzle has proved more efficacious, but it was not applied\r\nsystematically in England until a late date. Sometimes the regulations\r\nwere in the hands of the government, and sometimes they were left to\r\nlocal authorities; in either case they were allowed to lapse as soon as\r\nrabies had died down. In April 1897 the Board of Agriculture entered on\r\na systematic attempt to exterminate rabies by the means indicated. The\r\nplan was to enforce muzzling over large areas in which the disease\r\nexisted, and to maintain it for six months after the occurrence of the\r\nlast case. In spite of much opposition and criticism, this was\r\nresolutely carried out under Mr Walter Long, the responsible minister,\r\nand met with great success. By the spring of 1899--that is, in two\r\nyears--the disease had disappeared in Great Britain, except for one area\r\nin Wales; and, with this exception, muzzling was everywhere relaxed in\r\nOctober 1899. It was taken off in Wales also in the following May, no\r\ncase having occurred since November 1899. Rabies was then pronounced\r\nextinct. During the summer of 1900, however, it reappeared in Wales, and\r\nseveral counties were again placed under the order. The year 1901 was\r\nthe third in succession in which no death from hydrophobia was\r\nregistered in the United Kingdom. In the ten years preceding 1899, 104\r\ndeaths were registered, the death-rate reaching 30 in 1889 and averaging\r\n29 annually. In 1902 two deaths from hydrophobia were registered. From\r\nthat date to June 1909 (the latest available for the purpose of this\r\narticle) no death from hydrophobia was notified in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n  See _Annales de l'Institut Pasteur_, from 1886; _Journal of the Board\r\n  of Agriculture_, 1899; Makins, \"Hydrophobia,\" in Treves's _System of\r\n  Surgery_; Woodhead, \"Rabies,\" in Allbutt's _System of Medicine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROSPHERE (Gr. [Greek: hydôr], water, and [Greek: sphaira], sphere),\r\nin physical geography, a name given to the whole mass of the water of\r\nthe oceans, which fills the depressions in the earth's crust, and covers\r\nnearly three-quarters of its surface. The name is used in distinction\r\nfrom the atmosphere, the earth's envelope of air, the lithosphere (Gr.\r\n[Greek: lithos], rock) or solid crust of the earth, and the centrosphere\r\nor interior mass within the crust. To these \"spheres\" some writers add,\r\nby figurative usage, the terms \"biosphere,\" or life-sphere, to cover all\r\nliving things, both animals and plants, and \"psychosphere,\" or\r\nmind-sphere, covering all the products of human intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROSTATICS (Gr. [Greek: hydôr], water, and the root [Greek: sta]-, to\r\ncause to stand), the branch of hydromechanics which discusses the\r\nequilibrium of fluids (see HYDROMECHANICS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROXYLAMINE, NH2OH, or hydroxy-ammonia, a compound prepared in 1865 by\r\nW. C. Lossen by the reduction of ethyl nitrate with tin and hydrochloric\r\nacid. In 1870 E. Ludwig and T. H. Hein (_Chem. Centralblatt_, 1870, 1,\r\np. 340) obtained it by passing nitric oxide through a series of bottles\r\ncontaining tin and hydrochloric acid, to which a small quantity of\r\nplatinum tetrachloride has been added; the acid liquid is poured off\r\nwhen the operation is completed, and sulphuretted hydrogen is passed in;\r\nthe tin sulphide is filtered off and the filtrate evaporated. The\r\nresidue is extracted by absolute alcohol, which dissolves the\r\nhydroxylamine hydrochloride and a little ammonium chloride; this last\r\nsubstance is removed as ammonium platino-chloride, and the residual\r\nhydroxylamine hydrochloride is recrystallized. E. Divers obtains it by\r\nmixing cold saturated solutions containing one molecular proportion of\r\nsodium nitrate, and two molecular proportions of acid sodium sulphite,\r\nand then adding a saturated solution of potassium chloride to the\r\nmixture. After standing for twenty-four hours, hydroxylamine potassium\r\ndisulphonate crystallizes out. This is boiled for some hours with water\r\nand the solution cooled, when potassium sulphate separates first, and\r\nthen hydroxylamine sulphate. E. Tafel (_Zeit. anorg. Chem._, 1902, 31,\r\np. 289) patented an electrolytic process, wherein 50% sulphuric acid is\r\ntreated in a divided cell provided with a cathode of amalgamated lead,\r\n50% nitric acid being gradually run into the cathode compartment. Pure\r\nanhydrous hydroxylamine has been obtained by C. A. Lobry de Bruyn from\r\nthe hydrochloride, by dissolving it in absolute methyl alcohol and then\r\nadding sodium methylate. The precipitated sodium chloride is filtered,\r\nand the solution of hydroxylamine distilled in order to remove methyl\r\nalcohol, and finally fractionated under reduced pressure. The free base\r\nis a colourless, odourless, crystalline solid, melting at about 30° C.,\r\nand boiling at 58° C. (under a pressure of 22 mm.). It deliquesces and\r\noxidizes on exposure, inflames in dry chlorine and is reduced to ammonia\r\nby zinc dust. Its aqueous solution is strongly alkaline, and with acids\r\nit forms well-defined stable salts. E. Ebler and E. Schott (_J. pr.\r\nChem._, 1908, 78, p. 289) regard it as acting with the formula NH2·OH\r\ntowards bases, and as NH3:O towards acids, the salts in the latter case\r\nbeing of the oxonium type. It is a strong reducing agent, giving a\r\nprecipitate of cuprous oxide from alkaline copper solutions at ordinary\r\ntemperature, converting mercuric chloride to mercurous chloride, and\r\nprecipitating metallic silver from solutions of silver salts. With\r\naldehydes and ketones it forms oximes (q.v.). W. R. Dunstan (_Jour.\r\nChem. Soc._, 1899, 75, p. 792) found that the addition of methyl iodide\r\nto a methyl alcohol solution of hydroxylamine resulted in the formation\r\nof trimethyloxamine, N(CH3)3O.\r\n\r\n  Many substituted hydroxylamines are known, substitution taking place\r\n  either in the [alpha] or [beta] position\r\n\r\n    [beta]    [alpha]\r\n     (NH2   ·   OH^).\r\n\r\n  [beta]-phenylhydroxyl-amine, C6H5NH·OH·, is obtained in the reduction\r\n  of nitrobenzene in neutral solution (e.g. by the action of the\r\n  aluminium-mercury couple and water), but better, according to C.\r\n  Goldschmidt (_Ber._, 1896, 29, p. 2307) by dissolving nitrobenzene in\r\n  ten times its weight of ether containing a few cubic centimetres of\r\n  water, and heating with excess of zinc dust and anhydrous calcium\r\n  chloride for three hours on a water bath. It also appears as an\r\n  intermediate product in the electrolytic reduction of nitrobenzene in\r\n  sulphuric acid solution. By gentle oxidation it yields nitrosobenzene.\r\n  Derivatives of the type R2N·OH result in the action of the Grignard\r\n  reagent on amyl nitrite. Dihydroxy-ammonia or nitroxyl, NH(OH)2, a\r\n  very unstable and highly reactive substance, has been especially\r\n  studied by A. Angeli (see A. W. Stewart, _Recent Advances in Physical\r\n  and Inorganic Chemistry_, 1909).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROZOA, one of the most widely spread and prolific groups of aquatic\r\nanimals. They are for the most part marine in habitat, but a familiar\r\nfresh-water form is the common _Hydra_ of ponds and ditches, which gives\r\norigin to the name of the class. The Hydrozoa comprise the hydroids, so\r\nabundant on all shores, most of which resemble vegetable organisms to\r\nthe unassisted eye; the hydrocorallines, which, as their name implies,\r\nhave a massive stony skeleton and resemble corals; the jelly-fishes so\r\ncalled; and the Siphonophora, of which the species best known by repute\r\nis the so-called \"Portuguese man-of-war\" (_Physalia_), dreaded by\r\nsailors on account of its terrible stinging powers.\r\n\r\nIn external form and appearance the Hydrozoa exhibit such striking\r\ndifferences that there would seem at first sight to be little in common\r\nbetween the more divergent members of the group. Nevertheless there is\r\nno other class in the animal kingdom with better marked characteristics,\r\nor with more uniform morphological peculiarities underlying the utmost\r\ndiversity of superficial characters.\r\n\r\nAll Hydrozoa, in the first place, exhibit the three structural features\r\ndistinctive of the Coelentera (q.v.). (1) The body is built up of two\r\nlayers only, an external protective and sensory layer, the ectoderm, and\r\nan internal digestive layer, the endoderm. (2) The body contains but a\r\nsingle internal cavity, the coelenteron or gastrovascular space, which\r\nmay be greatly ramified, but is not shut off into cavities distinct from\r\nthe central digestive space. (3) The generative cells are produced in\r\neither the ectoderm or endoderm, and not in a third layer arising in the\r\nembryo, distinct from the two primary layers; in other words, there is\r\nno mesoderm or coelom.\r\n\r\nTo these three characters the Hydrozoa add a fourth which is distinctive\r\nof the subdivision of the Coelenterata termed the Cnidaria; that is to\r\nsay, they always possess peculiar stinging organs known as nettle-cells,\r\nor _nematocysts_ (_Cnidae_), each produced in a cell forming an integral\r\npart of the animal's tissues. The Hydrozoa are thus shown to belong to\r\nthe group of Coelenterata Cnidaria, and it remains to consider more\r\nfully their distinctive features, and in particular those which mark\r\nthem off from the other main division of the Cnidaria, the Anthozoa\r\n(q.v.), comprising the corals and sea-anemones.\r\n\r\nThe great diversity, to which reference has already been made, in the\r\nform and structure of the Hydrozoa is due to two principal causes. In\r\nthe first place, we find in this group two distinct types of person or\r\nindividual, the polyp and the medusa (qq.v.), each capable of a wide\r\nrange of variations; and when both polyp and medusa occur in the\r\nlife-cycle of the same species, as is frequently the case, the result is\r\nan alternation of generations of a type peculiarly characteristic of the\r\nclass. In the second place, the power of non-sexual reproduction by\r\nbudding is practically of universal occurrence among the Hydrozoa, and\r\nby the buds failing to separate from the parent stock, colonies are\r\nproduced, more or less complicated in structure and often of great size.\r\nWe find that polyps may either bud other polyps or may produce medusae,\r\nand that medusae may bud medusae, though never, apparently, polyps.\r\nHence we have a primary subdivision of the colonies of Hydrozoa into\r\nthose produced by budding of polyps and those produced by budding of\r\nmedusae. The former may contain polyp-persons and medusa-persons, either\r\none kind alone or both kinds combined; the latter will contain only\r\nmedusa-persons variously modified.\r\n\r\nThe morphology of the Hydrozoa reduces itself, therefore, to a\r\nconsideration of the morphology of the polyp, of the medusa and of the\r\ncolony. Putting aside the last-named, for a detailed account of which\r\nsee HYDROMEDUSAE, we can best deal with the peculiarities of the polyp\r\nand medusa from a developmental point of view.\r\n\r\n  In the development of the Hydrozoa, and indeed of the Cnidaria\r\n  generally, the egg usually gives rise to an oval larva which swims\r\n  about by means of a coating of cilia on the surface of the body. This\r\n  very characteristic larva is termed a _planula_, but though very\r\n  uniform externally, the planulae of different species, or of the same\r\n  species at different periods, do not always represent the same stage\r\n  of embryonic development internally. On examining more minutely the\r\n  course of the development, it is found that the ovum goes through the\r\n  usual process of cleavage, always total and regular in this group, and\r\n  so gives rise to a hollow sphere or ovoid with the wall composed of a\r\n  single layer of cells, and containing a spacious cavity, the\r\n  blastocoele or segmentation-cavity. This is the _blastula_ stage\r\n  occurring universally in all Metazoa, probably representing an\r\n  ancestral Protozoan colony in phylogeny. Next the blastula gives rise\r\n  to an internal mass of cells (fig. 1, hy) which come from the wall\r\n  either by immigration (fig. 1, A) or by splitting off (delamination).\r\n  The formation of an inner cell-mass converts the single-layered\r\n  blastula (monoblastula) into a double-layered embryo (diblastula)\r\n  which may be termed a parenchymula, since at first the inner cell-mass\r\n  forms an irregular parenchyma which may entirely fill up and\r\n  obliterate the segmentation cavity (fig. 1, B). At a later stage,\r\n  however, the cells of the inner mass arrange themselves in a definite\r\n  layer surrounding an internal cavity (fig. 1, C, al), which soon\r\n  acquires an opening to the exterior at one pole, and so forms the\r\n  characteristic embryonic stage of all Enterozoa known as the\r\n  _gastrula_ (fig. 2). In this stage the body is composed of two layers,\r\n  ectoderm (d) externally, and endoderm (c) internally, surrounding a\r\n  central cavity, the _archenteron_ (b), which communicates with the\r\n  exterior by a pore (a), the _blastopore_.\r\n\r\n  Thus a planula larva may be a blastula, or but slightly advanced\r\n  beyond this stage, or it may be (and most usually is) a parenchymula;\r\n  or in some cases (Scyphomedusae) it may be a gastrula. It should be\r\n  added that the process of development, the gastrulation as it is\r\n  termed, may be shortened by the immigration of cells taking place at\r\n  one pole only, and in a connected layer with orderly arrangement, so\r\n  that the gastrula stage is reached at once from the blastula without\r\n  any intervening parenchymula stage. This is a process of gastrulation\r\n  by invagination which is found in all animals above the Coelenterata,\r\n  but which is very rare in the Cnidaria, and is known only in the\r\n  Scyphomedusae amongst the Hydrozoa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Balfour, after Kowalewsky.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.--Formation of the Diblastula of _Eucope_ (one of the\r\n  Calyptoblastic _Hydromedusae_) by immigration. A, B, C, three\r\n  successive stages. _ep_, Ectoderm; _hy_, endoderm; _al_, enteric\r\n  cavity.]\r\n\r\n  After the gastrula stage, which is found as a developmental stage in\r\n  all Enterozoa, the embryo of the Hydrozoa proceeds to develop\r\n  characters which are peculiar to the Coelenterata only. Round the\r\n  blastopore hollow outgrowths, variable in number, arise by the\r\n  evagination of the entire body-wall, both ectoderm and endoderm. Each\r\n  outgrowth contains a prolongation of the archenteric cavity (compare\r\n  figs. 2 and 3, A). In this way is formed a ring of tentacles, the most\r\n  characteristic organs of the Cnidaria. They surround a region which is\r\n  termed the peristome, and which contains in the centre the blastopore,\r\n  which becomes the adult mouth. The archenteron becomes the\r\n  gastrovascular system or coelenteron. Between the ectoderm and\r\n  endoderm a gelatinous supporting layer, termed the mesogloea, makes\r\n  its appearance. The gastrula has now become an _actinula_, which may\r\n  be termed the distinctive larva of the Cnidaria, and doubtless\r\n  represents in a transitory manner the common ancestor of the group. In\r\n  no case known, however, does the actinula become the adult, sexually\r\n  mature individual, but always undergoes further modifications, whereby\r\n  it develops into either a polyp or a medusa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Gegenbaur's _Elements of Comparative Anatomy_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.--Diagram of a Diblastula.\r\n\r\n    a, Blastopore.\r\n    b, Archenteric cavity.\r\n    c, Endoderm.\r\n    d, Ectoderm.]\r\n\r\n  To become a polyp, the actinula (fig. 3, A) becomes attached to some\r\n  firm object by the pole farthest from the mouth, and its growth\r\n  preponderates in the direction of the principal axis, that is to say,\r\n  the axis passing through the mouth (fig. 3, _a-b_). As a result the\r\n  body becomes columnar in form (fig. 3, B), and without further change\r\n  passes into the characteristic polyp-form (see POLYP).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Diagram showing the change of the Actinula (A)\r\n  into a Polyp (B); _a-b_, principal (vertical) axis; _c-d_, horizontal\r\n  axis. The endoderm is shaded, the ectoderm is left clear.]\r\n\r\n  It is convenient to distinguish two types of polyp by the names hydro\r\n  polyp and anthopolyp, characteristic of the Hydrozoa and Anthozoa\r\n  respectively. In the hydropolyp the body is typically elongated, the\r\n  height of the column being far greater than the diameter. The\r\n  peristome is relatively small and the mouth is generally raised on a\r\n  projecting spout or _hypostome_. The ectoderm loses entirely the\r\n  ciliation which it had in the planula and actinula stages and commonly\r\n  secretes on its external surface a protective or supporting\r\n  investment, the perisarc. Contrasting with this, the anthopolyp is\r\n  generally of squat form, the diameter often exceeding the height; the\r\n  peristome is wide, a hypostome is lacking, and the ectoderm, or so\r\n  much of it as is exposed, i.e. not covered by secretion of skeletal or\r\n  other investment, retains its ciliation throughout life. The internal\r\n  structural differences are even more characteristic. In the hydropolyp\r\n  the blastopore of the embryo forms the adult mouth situated at the\r\n  extremity of the hypostome, and the ectoderm and endoderm meet at this\r\n  point. In the anthopolyp the blastopore is carried inwards by an\r\n  in-pushing of the body-wall of the region of the peristome, so that\r\n  the adult mouth is an opening leading into a short ectodermal\r\n  oesophagus or stomodaeum, at the bottom of which is the blastopore.\r\n  Further, in the hydropolyp the digestive cavity either remains simple\r\n  and undivided and circular in transverse section, or may show ridges\r\n  projecting internally, which in this case are formed of endoderm\r\n  alone, without any participation of the mesogloea. In the anthopolyp,\r\n  on the other hand, the digestive cavity is always subdivided by\r\n  so-called mesenteries, in-growths of the endoderm containing vertical\r\n  lamellae of mesogloea (see ANTHOZOA). In short, the hydropolyp is\r\n  characterized by a more simple type of organization than the\r\n  anthopolyp, and is in most respects less modified from the actinula\r\n  type of structure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Diagram showing the change of the Actinula\r\n  into a Medusa. A, Vertical section of the actinula; _a-b_ and _c-d_ as\r\n  in fig. 3, B, transitional stage, showing preponderating growth in the\r\n  horizontal plane. C, C', D, D', two types of medusa organization; C\r\n  and D are composite sections, showing a radius (R) on one side, an\r\n  interradius (IR) on the other; C' and D' are plans; the mouth and\r\n  manubrium are indicated at the centre, leading into the gastral cavity\r\n  subdivided by the four areas of concrescence in each interradius (IR).\r\n  t, tentacle; g.p, gastric pouch; r.c, radial canal not present in C\r\n  and C'; c.c, circular or ring-canal; e.l, endoderm-lamella formed by\r\n  concrescence. For a more detailed diagram of medusa-structure see\r\n  article MEDUSA.]\r\n\r\n  Returning now to the actinula, this form may, as already stated,\r\n  develop into a medusa, a type of individual found only in the\r\n  Hydrozoa, as here understood. To become a medusa, the actinula grows\r\n  scarcely at all in the direction of the principal axis, but greatly\r\n  along a plane at right angles to it. Thus the body becomes\r\n  umbrella-shaped, the concave side representing the peristome, and the\r\n  convex side the column, of the polyp. Hence the tentacles are found at\r\n  the edge of the umbrella, and the hypostome forms usually a projecting\r\n  tube, with the mouth at the extremity, forming the _manubrium_ or\r\n  handle of the umbrella. The medusa has a pronounced radial symmetry,\r\n  and the positions of the primary tentacles, usually four in number,\r\n  mark out the so-called _radii_, alternating with which are four\r\n  _interradii_. The ectoderm retains its ciliation only in the sensory\r\n  organs. The mesogloea becomes enormously increased in quantity (hence\r\n  the popular name \"jelly-fish\"), and in correlation with this the\r\n  endoderm-layer lining the coelenteron becomes pressed together in the\r\n  interradial areas and undergoes concrescence, forming a more or less\r\n  complicated gastrovascular system (see MEDUSA). It is sufficient to\r\n  state here that the medusa is usually a free-swimming animal, floating\r\n  mouth downwards on the open seas, but in some cases it may be attached\r\n  by its aboral pole, like a polyp, to some firm basis, either\r\n  temporarily or permanently.\r\n\r\n  Thus the development of the two types of individual seen in the\r\n  Hydrozoa may be summarized as follows:--\r\n\r\n                  /      Egg\r\n                 |        |\r\n    Free         |     Blastula\r\n                 |        |\r\n    \"Planula\"   <   Parenchymula\r\n                 |        |\r\n    Stage        |     Gastrula\r\n                 |        |\r\n                  \\    Actinula\r\n                         /  \\\r\n                        /    \\\r\n                     Polyp  Medusa\r\n\r\n  This development, though probably representing the primitive sequence\r\n  of events, is never actually found in its full extent, but is always\r\n  abbreviated by omission or elimination of one or more of the stages.\r\n  We have already seen that the parenchymula stage is passed over when\r\n  the gastrulation is of the invaginate type. On the other hand, the\r\n  parenchymula may develop directly into the actinula or even into the\r\n  polyp, with suppression of the intervening steps. Great apparent\r\n  differences may also be brought about by variations in the period at\r\n  which the embryo is set free as a larva, and since two free-swimming\r\n  stages, planula and actinula, are unnecessary, one or other of them is\r\n  always suppressed. A good example of this is seen in two common genera\r\n  of British hydroids, _Cordylophora_ and _Tabularia_. In _Cordylophora_\r\n  the embryo is set free at the parenchymula stage as a planula which\r\n  fixes itself and develops into a polyp, both gastrula and actinula\r\n  stages being suppressed. In _Tubularia_, on the other hand, the\r\n  parenchymula develops into an actinula within the maternal tissues,\r\n  and is then set free, creeps about for a time, and after fixing\r\n  itself, changes into a polyp; hence in this case the planula-stage, as\r\n  a free larva, is entirely suppressed.\r\n\r\n  The Hydrozoa may be defined, therefore, as Cnidaria in which two types\r\n  of individual, the polyp and the medusa, may be present, each type\r\n  developed along divergent lines from the primitive actinula form. The\r\n  polyp (hydropolyp) is of simple structure and never has an ectodernal\r\n  oesophagus or mesenteries.[1] The general ectoderm loses its cilia,\r\n  which persist only in the sensory cells, and it frequently secretes\r\n  external protective or supporting structures. An internal mesogloeal\r\n  skeleton is not found.\r\n\r\n  The class is divisible into two main divisions or sub-classes,\r\n  Hydromedusae and Scyphomedusae, of which definitions and detailed\r\n  systematic accounts will be found under these headings.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL WORKS ON HYDROZOA.--C.

M.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] See further under SCYPHOMEDUSAE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYENA, a name applicable to all the representatives of the mammalian\r\nfamily _Hyaenidae_, a group of Carnivora (q.v.) allied to the civets.\r\nFrom all other large Carnivora except the African hunting-dog, hyenas\r\nare distinguished by having only four toes on each foot, and are further\r\ncharacterized by the length of the fore-legs as compared with the hind\r\npair, the non-retractile claws, and the enormous strength of the jaws\r\nand teeth, which enables them to break the hardest bones and to retain\r\nwhat they have seized with unrelaxing grip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--The Striped Hyena (_Hyaena striata_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--The Spotted Hyena (_Hyaena crocuta_).]\r\n\r\nThe striped hyena (_Hyaena striata_) is the most widely distributed\r\nspecies, being found throughout India, Persia, Asia Minor, and North and\r\nEast Africa, the East African form constituting a distinct race, _H.\r\nstriata schillingsi_; while there are also several distinct Asiatic\r\nraces. The species resembles a wolf in size, and is greyish-brown In\r\ncolour, marked with indistinct longitudinal stripes of a darker hue,\r\nwhile the legs are transversely striped. The hairs on the body are long,\r\nespecially on the ridge of the neck and back, where they form a distinct\r\nmane, which is continued along the tail. Nocturnal in habits, it prefers\r\nby day the gloom of caves and ruins, or of the burrows which it\r\noccasionally forms, and issues forth at sunset, when it commences its\r\nunearthly howling. When the animal is excited, the howl changes into\r\nwhat has been compared to demoniac laughter, whence the name of\r\n\"laughing-hyena.\" These creatures feed chiefly on carrion, and thus\r\nperform useful service by devouring remains which might otherwise\r\npollute the air. Even human dead are not safe from their attacks, their\r\npowerful claws enabling them to gain access to newly interred bodies in\r\ncemeteries. Occasionally (writes Dr W. T. Blanford) sheep or goats, and\r\nmore often dogs, are carried off, and the latter, at all events, are\r\noften taken alive to the animal's den. This species appears to be\r\nsolitary in habits, and it is rare to meet with more than two together.\r\nThe cowardice of this hyena is proverbial; despite its powerful teeth,\r\nit rarely attempts to defend itself. A very different animal is the\r\nspotted hyena, _Hyaena (Crocuta) crocuta_, which has the sectorial teeth\r\nof a more cat-like type, and is marked by dark-brown spots on a\r\nyellowish ground, while the mane is much less distinct. At the Cape it\r\nwas formerly common, and occasionally committed great havoc among the\r\ncattle, while it did not hesitate to enter the Kaffir dwellings at\r\nnight and carry off children sleeping by their mothers. By persistent\r\ntrapping and shooting, its numbers have now been considerably reduced,\r\nwith the result, however, of making it exceedingly wary, so that it is\r\nnot readily caught in any trap with which it has had an opportunity of\r\nbecoming acquainted. Its range extends from Abyssinia to the Cape. The\r\nAbyssinian form has been regarded as a distinct species, under the name\r\nof _H. liontiewi_, but this, like various more southern forms, is but\r\nregarded as a local race. The brown hyena (_H. brunnea_) is South\r\nAfrican, ranging to Angola on the west and Kilimanjaro on the east. In\r\nsize it resembles the striped hyena, but differs in appearance, owing to\r\nthe fringe of long hair covering the neck and fore part of the back. The\r\ngeneral hue is ashy-brown, with the hair lighter on the neck (forming a\r\ncollar), chest and belly; while the legs are banded with dark brown.\r\nThis species is not often seen, as it remains concealed during the day.\r\nThose frequenting the coast feed on dead fish, crabs and an occasional\r\nstranded whale, though they are also a danger to the sheep and cattle\r\nkraal. Strand-wolf is the local name at the Cape.\r\n\r\nAlthough hyenas are now confined to the warmer regions of the Old World,\r\nfossil remains show that they had a more northerly range during Tertiary\r\ntimes; the European cave-hyena being a form of the spotted species,\r\nknown as _H. crocuta spelaea_. Fossil hyenas occur in the Lower Pliocene\r\nof Greece, China, India, &c.; while remains indistinguishable from those\r\nof the striped species have been found in the Upper Pliocene of England\r\nand Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYÈRES, a town in the department of the Var in S.E. France, 11 m. by\r\nrail E. of Toulon. In 1906 the population of the commune was 17,790, of\r\nthe town 10,464; the population of the former was more than doubled in\r\nthe last decade of the 19th century. Hyères is celebrated (as is also\r\nits fashionable suburb, Costebelle, nearer the seashore) as a winter\r\nhealth resort. The town proper is situated about 2½ m. from the\r\nseashore, and on the south-western slope of a steep hill (669 ft.,\r\nbelonging to the Maurettes chain, 961 ft.), which is one of the\r\nwesternmost spurs of the thickly wooded Montagnes des Maures. It is\r\nsheltered from the north-east and east winds, but is exposed to the cold\r\nnorth-west wind or _mistral_. Towards the south and south-east a fertile\r\nplain, once famous for its orange groves, but now mainly covered by\r\nvineyards and farms, stretches to the sea, while to the south-west,\r\nacross a narrow valley, rises a cluster of low hills, on which is the\r\nsuburb of Costebelle. The older portion of the town is still surrounded,\r\non the north and east, by its ancient, though dilapidated medieval\r\nwalls, and is a labyrinth of steep and dirty streets. The more modern\r\nquarter which has grown up at the southern foot of the hill has handsome\r\nbroad boulevards and villas, many of them with beautiful gardens, filled\r\nwith semi-tropical plants. Among the objects of interest in the old town\r\nare: the house (Rue Rabaton, 7) where J. B. Massillon (1663-1742), the\r\nfamous pulpit orator, was born; the parish church of St Louis, built\r\noriginally in the 13th century by the Cordelier or Franciscan friars,\r\nbut completely restored in the earlier part of the 19th century; and the\r\nsite of the old château, on the summit of the hill, now occupied by a\r\nvilla. The plain between the new town and the sea is occupied by large\r\nnurseries, an excellent _jardin d'acclimatation_, and many market\r\ngardens, which supply Paris and London with early fruits and vegetables,\r\nespecially artichokes, as well as with roses in winter. There are\r\nextensive salt beds (_salines_) both on the peninsula of Giens, S. of\r\nthe town, and also E. of the town. To the east of the Giens peninsula is\r\nthe fine natural harbour of Hyères, as well as three thinly populated\r\nislands (the Stoechades of the ancients), Porquerolles, Port Cros and Le\r\nLevant, which are grouped together under the common name of Îles\r\nd'Hyères.\r\n\r\nThe town of Hyères seems to have been founded in the 10th century, as a\r\nplace of defence against pirates, and takes its name from the aires\r\n(_hierbo_ in the Provençal dialect), or threshing-floors for corn, which\r\nthen occupied its site. It passed from the possession of the viscounts\r\nof Marseilles to Charles of Anjou, count of Provence, and brother of St\r\nLouis (the latter landed here in 1254, on his return from Egypt). The\r\nchâteau was dismantled by Henri IV., but thanks to its walls, the town\r\nresisted in 1707 an attack made by the duke of Savoy.\r\n\r\n  See Ch. Lenthéric, _La Provence Maritime ancienne et moderne_ (chap.\r\n  5) (Paris, 1880).     (W. A. B. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGIEIA, in Greek mythology, the goddess of health. It seems probable\r\nthat she was originally an abstraction, subsequently personified, rather\r\nthan an independent divinity of very ancient date. The question of the\r\noriginal home of her worship has been much discussed. The oldest traces\r\nof it, so far as is known at present, are to be found at Titane in the\r\nterritory of Sicyon, where she was worshipped together with Asclepius,\r\nto whom she appears completely assimilated, not an independent\r\npersonality. Her cult was not introduced at Epidaurus till a late date,\r\nand therefore, when in 420 B.C. the worship of Asclepius was introduced\r\nat Athens coupled with that of Hygieia, it is not to be inferred that\r\nshe accompanied him from Epidaurus, or that she is a Peloponnesian\r\nimportation at all. It is most probable that she was invented at the\r\ntime of the introduction of Asclepius, after the sufferings caused by\r\nthe plague had directed special attention to sanitary matters. The\r\nalready existing worship of Athena Hygieia had nothing to do with\r\nHygieia the goddess of health, but merely denoted the recognition of the\r\npower of healing as one of the attributes of Athena, which gradually\r\nbecame crystallized into a concrete personality. At first no special\r\nrelationship existed between Asclepius and Hygieia, but gradually she\r\ncame to be regarded as his daughter, the place of his wife being already\r\nsecured by Epione. Later Orphic hymns, however, and Herodas iv. 1-9,\r\nmake her the wife of Asclepius. The cult of Hygieia then spread\r\nconcurrently with that of Asclepius, and was introduced at Rome from\r\nEpidaurus in 293, by which time she may have been admitted (which was\r\nnot the case before) into the Epidaurian family of the god. Her proper\r\nname as a Romanized Greek importation was Valetudo, but she was\r\ngradually identified with Salus, an older genuine Italian divinity, to\r\nwhom a temple had already been erected in 302. While in classical times\r\nAsclepius and Hygieia are simply the god and goddess of health, in the\r\ndeclining years of paganism they are protecting divinities generally,\r\nwho preserve mankind not only from sickness but from all dangers on land\r\nand sea. In works of art Hygieia is represented, together with\r\nAsclepius, as a maiden of benevolent appearance, wearing the chiton and\r\ngiving food or drink to a serpent out of a dish.\r\n\r\n  See the article by H. Lechat in Daremberg and Saglio's _Dictionnaire\r\n  des antiquités_, with full references to authorities; and E. Thrämer\r\n  in Roscher's _Lexikon der Mythologie_, with a special section on the\r\n  modern theories of Hygieia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGIENE (Fr. _hygiène_, from Gr. [Greek: hygiainein], to be healthy),\r\nthe science of preserving health, its practical aim being to render\r\n\"growth more perfect, decay less rapid, life more vigorous, death more\r\nremote.\" The subject is thus a very wide one, embracing all the agencies\r\nwhich affect the physical and mental well-being of man, and it requires\r\nacquaintance with such diverse sciences as physics, chemistry, geology,\r\nengineering, architecture, meteorology, epidemiology, bacteriology and\r\nstatistics. On the personal or individual side it involves consideration\r\nof the character and quality of food and of water and other beverages;\r\nof clothing; of work, exercise and sleep; of personal cleanliness, of\r\nspecial habits, such as the use of tobacco, narcotics, &c.; and of\r\ncontrol of sexual and other passions. In its more general and public\r\naspects it must take cognizance of meteorological conditions, roughly\r\nincluded under the term climate; of the site or soil on which dwellings\r\nare placed; of the character, materials and arrangement of dwellings,\r\nwhether regarded individually or in relation to other houses among which\r\nthey stand; of their heating and ventilation; of the removal of excreta\r\nand other effete matters; of medical knowledge relating to the incidence\r\nand prevention of disease; and of the disposal of the dead.\r\n\r\n  These topics will be found treated in such articles as DIETETICS,\r\n  FOOD, FOOD-PRESERVATION, ADULTERATION, WATER, HEATING, VENTILATION,\r\n  SEWERAGE, BACTERIOLOGY, HOUSING, CREMATION, &c. For legal enactments\r\n  which concern the sanitary well-being of the community, see PUBLIC\r\n  HEALTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGINUS, eighth pope. It was during his pontificate (c. 137-140) that\r\nthe gnostic heresies began to manifest themselves at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGINUS (surnamed GROMATICUS, from _gruma_, a surveyor's measuring-rod),\r\nLatin writer on land-surveying, flourished in the reign of Trajan (A.D.\r\n98-117). Fragments of a work on legal boundaries attributed to him will\r\nbe found in C. F. Lachmann, _Gromatici Veteres_, i. (1848).\r\n\r\n  A treatise on Castrametation (_De Munitionibus Castrorum_), also\r\n  attributed to him, is probably of later date, about the 3rd century\r\n  A.D. (ed. W. Gemoll, 1879; A. von Domaszewski, 1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGINUS, GAIUS JULIUS, Latin author, a native of Spain (or Alexandria),\r\nwas a pupil of the famous Cornelius Alexander Polyhistor and a freedman\r\nof Augustus, by whom he was made superintendent of the Palatine library\r\n(Suetonius, _De Grammaticis_, 20). He is said to have fallen into great\r\npoverty in his old age, and to have been supported by the historian\r\nClodius Licinus. He was a voluminous author, and his works included\r\ntopographical and biographical treatises, commentaries on Helvius Cinna\r\nand the poems of Virgil, and disquisitions on agriculture and\r\nbee-keeping. All these are lost.\r\n\r\n  Under the name of Hyginus two school treatises on mythology are\r\n  extant: (1) _Fabularum Liber_, some 300 mythological legends and\r\n  celestial genealogies, valuable for the use made by the author of the\r\n  works of Greek tragedians now lost; (2) _De Astronomia_, usually\r\n  called _Poetica Astronomica_, containing an elementary treatise on\r\n  astronomy and the myths connected with the stars, chiefly based on the\r\n  [Greek: Katasterismoi] of Eratosthenes. Both are abridgments and both\r\n  are by the same hand; but the style and Latinity and the elementary\r\n  mistakes (especially in the rendering of the Greek originals) are held\r\n  to prove that they cannot have been the work of so distinguished a\r\n  scholar as C. Julius Hyginus. It is suggested that these treatises are\r\n  an abridgment (made in the latter half of the 2nd century) of the\r\n  _Genealogiae_ of Hyginus by an unknown grammarian, who added a\r\n  complete treatise on mythology.\r\n\r\n  EDITIONS.--_Fabulae_, by M. Schmidt (1872); _De Astronomia_, by B.\r\n  Bunte (1875); see also Bunte, _De C. Julii Hygini, Augusti Liberti,\r\n  Vita et Scriptis_ (1846).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGROMETER (Gr. [Greek: hygros], moist, [Greek: metron], a measure), an\r\ninstrument for measuring the absolute or relative amount of moisture in\r\nthe atmosphere; an instrument which only qualitatively determines\r\nchanges in the humidity is termed a \"hygroscope.\" The earlier\r\ninstruments generally depended for their action on the contraction or\r\nextension of substances when exposed to varying degrees of moisture;\r\ncatgut, hair, twisted cords and wooden laths, all of which contract with\r\nan increase in the humidity and vice versa, being the most favoured\r\nmaterials. The familiar \"weather house\" exemplifies this property. This\r\ntoy consists of a house provided with two doors, through which either a\r\nman or woman appears according as the weather is about to be wet or\r\nfine. This action is effected by fixing a catgut thread to the base on\r\nwhich the figures are mounted, in such a manner that contraction of the\r\nthread rotates the figures so that the man appears and extension so that\r\nthe woman appears.\r\n\r\n  Many of the early forms are described in C. Hutton, _Math. and Phil.\r\n  Dictionary_ (1815). The modern instruments, which utilize other\r\n  principles, are described in METEOROLOGY: II. _Methods and Apparatus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYKSOS, or \"SHEPHERD KINGS,\" the name of the earliest invaders of Egypt\r\nof whom we have definite evidence in tradition. Josephus (c. _Apion._ i.\r\n14), who identifies the Hyksos with the Israelites, preserves a passage\r\nfrom the second book of Manetho giving an account of them. (It may be\r\nthat Josephus had it, not direct from Manetho's writings, but through\r\nthe garbled version of some Alexandrine compiler.) In outline it is as\r\nfollows. In the days of a king of Egypt named Timaeus the land was\r\nsuddenly invaded from the east by men of ignoble race, who conquered it\r\nwithout a struggle, destroyed cities and temples, and slew or enslaved\r\nthe inhabitants. At length they elected a king named Salatis, who,\r\nresiding at Memphis, made all Egypt tributary, and established garrisons\r\nin different parts, especially eastwards, fearing the Assyrians. He\r\nbuilt also a great fortress at Avaris, in the Sethroite nome, east of\r\nthe Bubastite branch of the Nile. Salatis was followed in succession by\r\nBeon, Apachnas, Apophis, Jannas and Asses. These six kings reigned 198\r\nyears and 10 months, and all aimed at extirpating the Egyptians. Their\r\nwhole race was named Hyksos, i.e. \"shepherd kings,\" and some say they\r\nwere Arabs (another explanation found by Josephus is \"captive\r\nshepherds\"). When they and their successors had held Egypt for 511\r\nyears, the kings of the Thebais and other parts of Egypt rebelled, and a\r\nlong and mighty war began. Misphragmuthosis worsted the \"Shepherds\" and\r\nshut them up in Avaris; and his son Thutmosis, failing to capture the\r\nstronghold, allowed them to depart; whereupon they went forth, 240,000\r\nin number, established themselves in Judea and built Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nIn Manetho's list of kings, the six above named (with many variations in\r\ndetail) form the XVth dynasty, and are called \"six foreign Phoenician\r\nkings.\" The XVIth dynasty is of thirty-two \"Hellenic (_sic?_) shepherd\r\nkings,\" the seventeenth is of \"shepherds and Theban kings\" (reigning\r\nsimultaneously). The lists vary greatly in different versions, but the\r\nabove seems the most reasonable selection of readings to be made. For\r\n\"Hellenic\" see below. The supposed connexion with the Israelites has\r\nmade the problem of the Hyksos attractive, but light is coming upon it\r\nvery slowly. In 1847 E. de Rougé proved from a fragment of a story in\r\nthe papyri of the British Museum, that Apopi was one of the latest of\r\nthe Hyksos kings, corresponding to Aphobis; he was king of the \"pest\"\r\nand suppressed the worship of the Egyptian gods, and endeavoured to make\r\nthe Egyptians worship his god Setekh or Seti; at the same time an\r\nEgyptian named Seqenenre reigned in Thebes, more or less subject to\r\nAphobis. The city of Hawari (Avaris) was also mentioned in the fragment.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 a record of the capture of this city from the Hyksos by Ahmosi,\r\nthe founder of the eighteenth dynasty, was discovered by the same\r\nscholar. A large class of monuments was afterwards attributed to the\r\nHyksos, probably in error. Some statues and sphinxes, found in 1861 by\r\nMariette at Tanis (in the north-east of the Delta), which had been\r\nusurped by later kings, had peculiar \"un-Egyptian\" features. One of\r\nthese bore the name of Apopi engraved lightly on the shoulder; this was\r\nevidently a usurper's mark, but from the whole circumstances it was\r\nconcluded that these, and others of the same type of features found\r\nelsewhere, must have belonged to the Hyksos. This view held the field\r\nuntil 1893, when Golénischeff produced an inferior example bearing its\r\noriginal name, which showed that in this case it represented Amenemhe\r\nIII. In consequence it is now generally believed that they all belong to\r\nthe twelfth dynasty. Meanwhile a headless statue of a king named Khyan,\r\nfound at Bubastis, was attributed on various grounds to the Hyksos, the\r\nsoundest arguments being his foreign name and the boastful un-Egyptian\r\nepithet \"beloved of his _ka_,\" where \"beloved of Ptah\" or some other god\r\nwas to be expected. His name was immediately afterwards recognized on a\r\nlion found as far away from Egypt as Bagdad. Flinders Petrie then\r\npointed out a group of kings named on scarabs of peculiar type, which,\r\nincluding Khyan, he attributed to the period between the Old Kingdom and\r\nthe New, while others were in favour of assigning them all to the\r\nHyksos, whose appellation seemed to be recognizable in the title\r\nHek-khos, \"ruler of the barbarians,\" borne by Khyan. The extraordinary\r\nimportance of Khyan was further shown by the discovery of his name on a\r\njar-lid at Cnossus in Crete. Semitic features were pointed out in the\r\nsupposed Hyksos names, and Petrie was convinced of their date by his\r\nexcavations of 1905-1906 in the eastern Delta. Avaris is generally\r\nassigned to the region towards Pelusium on the strength of its being\r\nlocated in the Sethroite nome by Josephus, but Petrie thinks it was at\r\nTell el-Yahudiyeh (Yehudia), where Hyksos scarabs are common. From the\r\nremains of fortifications there he argues that the Hyksos were\r\nuncivilized desert people, skilled in the use of the bow, and must thus\r\nhave destroyed by their archery the Egyptian armies trained to fight\r\nhand-to-hand; further, that their hordes were centered in Syria, but\r\nwere driven thence by a superior force in the East to take refuge in the\r\nislands and became a sea-power--whence the strange description\r\n\"Hellenic\" in Manetho, which most editors have corrected to [Greek:\r\nalloi], \"others.\" Besides the statue of Khyan, blocks of granite with\r\nthe name of Apopi have been found in Upper Egypt at Gebelen and in\r\nLower Egypt at Bubastis. The celebrated Rhind mathematical papyrus was\r\ncopied in the reign of an Apopi from an original of the time of Amenemhe\r\nIII. Large numbers of Hyksos scarabs are found in Upper and Lower Egypt,\r\nand they are not unknown in Palestine. Khyan's monuments, inconspicuous\r\nas they are, actually extend over a wider area--from Bagdad to\r\nCnossus--than those of any other Egyptian king.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that this mysterious people were Asiatic, for they are\r\ncalled so by the Egyptians. Though Seth was an Egyptian god, as god of\r\nthe Hyksos he represents some Asiatic deity. The possibility of a\r\nconnexion between the Hyksos and the Israelites is still admitted in\r\nsome quarters. Hatred of these impious foreigners, of which there is\r\nsome trace in more than one text, aroused amongst the Egyptians (as\r\nnothing ever did before or since) that martial spirit which carried the\r\narmies of Tethmosis to the Euphrates.\r\n\r\n  Besides the histories of Egypt, see J. H. Breasted, _Ancient Records\r\n  of Egypt_; Historical Documents ii. 4, 125; G. Maspero, _Contes\r\n  populaires_, 3me éd. p. 236; W. M. F.

G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYLAS, In Greek legend, son of Theiodamas, king of the Dryopians in\r\nThessaly, the favourite of Heracles and his companion on the Argonautic\r\nexpedition. Having gone ashore at Kios in Mysia to fetch water, he was\r\ncarried off by the nymphs of the spring in which he dipped his pitcher.\r\nHeracles sought him in vain, and the answer of Hylas to his\r\nthrice-repeated cry was lost in the depths of the water. Ever\r\nafterwards, in memory of the threat of Heracles to ravage the land if\r\nHylas were not found, the inhabitants of Kios every year on a stated day\r\nroamed the mountains, shouting aloud for Hylas (Apollonius Rhodius i.\r\n1207; Theocritus xiii.; Strabo xii. 564; Propertius i. 20; Virgil,\r\n_Ecl._ vi. 43). But, although the legend is first told in Alexandrian\r\ntimes, the \"cry of Hylas\" occurs long before as the \"Mysian cry\" in\r\nAeschylus (_Persae_, 1054), and in Aristophanes (_Plutus_, 1127) \"to cry\r\nHylas\" is used proverbially of seeking something in vain. Hylas, like\r\nAdonis and Hyacinthus, represents the fresh vegetation of spring, or the\r\nwater of a fountain, which dries up under the heat of summer. It is\r\nsuggested that Hylas was a harvest deity and that the ceremony gone\r\nthrough by the Kians was a harvest festival, at which the figure of a\r\nboy was thrown into the water, signifying the dying vegetation-spirit of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n  See G. Türk in _Breslauer Philologische Abhandlungen_, vii. (1895); W.\r\n  Mannhardt, _Mythologische Forschungen_ (1884).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYLOZOISM (Gr. [Greek: hylê], matter, [Greek: zôê], life), in\r\nphilosophy, a term applied to any system which explains all life,\r\nwhether physical or mental, as ultimately derived from matter (\"cosmic\r\nmatter,\" _Weldstoff_). Such a view of existence has been common\r\nthroughout the history of thought, and especially among physical\r\nscientists. Thus the Ionian school of philosophy, which began with\r\nThales, sought for the beginning of all things in various material\r\nsubstances, water, air, fire (see IONIAN SCHOOL). These substances were\r\nregarded as being in some sense alive, and taking some active part in\r\nthe development of being. This primitive hylozoism reappeared in\r\nmodified forms in medieval and Renaissance thought, and in modern times\r\nthe doctrine of materialistic monism is its representative. Between\r\nmodern materialism and hylozoism proper there is, however, the\r\ndistinction that the ancients, however vaguely, conceived the elemental\r\nmatter as being in some sense animate if not actually conscious and\r\nconative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYMEN, or HYMENAEUS, originally the name of the song sung at marriages\r\namong the Greeks. As usual the name gradually produced the idea of an\r\nactual person whose adventures gave rise to the custom of this song. He\r\noccurs often in association with Linus and Ialemus, who represent\r\nsimilar personifications, and is generally called a son of Apollo and a\r\nMuse. As the son of Dionysus and Aphrodite, he was regarded as a god of\r\nfruitfulness. In Attic legend he was a beautiful youth who, being in\r\nlove with a girl, followed her in a procession to Eleusis disguised as a\r\nwoman, and saved the whole band from pirates. As reward he obtained the\r\ngirl in marriage, and his happy married life caused him ever afterwards\r\nto be invoked in marriage songs (Servius on Virgil, _Aen._ i. 651).\r\nAccording to another story, he was a youth who was killed by the fall of\r\nhis house on his wedding day; hence he was invoked, to propitiate him\r\nand avert a similar fate from others (Servius, loc. cit.). He is\r\nrepresented in works of art as an effeminate-looking, winged youth,\r\ncarrying a bridal torch and wearing a nuptial veil. The marriage song\r\nwas sung, with musical accompaniment, during the procession of the bride\r\nfrom her parents' house to that of the bridegroom, Hymenaeus being\r\ninvoked at the end of each portion.\r\n\r\n  See R. Schmidt, _De Hymenaeo el Talasio_ (1886), and J. A. Hild in\r\n  Daremberg and Saglis's _Dictionnaire des antiquités_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYMENOPTERA (Gr. [Greek: hymên], a membrane, and [Greek: pteron], a\r\nwing), a term used in zoological classification for one of the most\r\nimportant orders of the class _Hexapoda_ (q.v.). The order was founded\r\nby Linnaeus (_Systema Naturae_, 1735), and is still recognized by all\r\nnaturalists in the sense proposed by him, to include the saw-flies,\r\ngall-flies, ichneumon-flies and their allies, ants, wasps and bees. The\r\nrelationship of the Hymenoptera to other orders of insects is discussed\r\nin the article HEXAPODA, but it may be mentioned here that in structure\r\nthe highest members of the order are remarkably specialized, and that in\r\nthe perfection of their instincts they stand at the head of all insects\r\nand indeed of all invertebrate animals. About 30,000 species of\r\nHymenoptera are now known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: After C. L. Marlatt, _Bur. Ent.

The more generalized Hymenoptera\r\n  have the second maxillae but slightly modified, their inner lobes\r\n  being fused to form a _ligula_ (fig. 1, B, b). In the higher families\r\n  this structure becomes elongated (fig. 2, g) so as to form an\r\n  elaborate sucking-organ or \"tongue.\" These insects are able,\r\n  therefore, to bite as well as to suck, whereas most insects which have\r\n  acquired the power of suction have lost that of biting. Both fore- and\r\n  hind-wings are usually present, both pairs being membranous, the\r\n  hind-wings small and not folded when at rest, each provided along the\r\n  costa with a row of curved hooks which catch on to a fold along the\r\n  dorsum of the adjacent fore-wing during flight. A large number of\r\n  Hymenoptera are, however, entirely wingless--at least as regards one\r\n  sex or form of the species. One of the most remarkable features is the\r\n  close union of the foremost abdominal segment (fig. 3, i.) with the\r\n  metathorax, of which it often seems to form a part, the apparent first\r\n  abdominal segment being, in such case, really the second (fig. 3,\r\n  ii.). The true first segment, which undergoes a more or less complete\r\n  fusion with the thorax is known as the \"median segment\" or\r\n  _propodeum_. In female Hymenoptera the typical insectan ovipositor\r\n  with its three pairs of processes is well developed, and in the higher\r\n  families this organ becomes functional as a sting (fig. 5),--used for\r\n  offence and defence. As regards their life history, all Hymenoptera\r\n  undergo a \"complete\" metamorphosis. The larva is soft-skinned\r\n  (eruciform), being either a caterpillar (fig. 6, b) or a legless grub\r\n  (fig. 7, a), and the pupa is free (fig. 7, c), i.e. with the\r\n  appendages not fixed to the body, as is the case in the pupa of most\r\n  moths.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Fore-Wings of Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n    1.

Apidae (_Apathus_).]\r\n\r\n  _Structure._--The head of a hymenopterous insect bears three simple\r\n  eyes (ocelli) on the front and vertex in addition to the large\r\n  compound eyes. The feelers are generally simple in type, rarely\r\n  showing serrations or prominent appendages; but one or two basal\r\n  segments are frequently differentiated to form an elongate \"scape,\"\r\n  the remaining segments--carried at an elbowed angle to the\r\n  scape--making up the \"flagellum\"; the segments of the flagellum often\r\n  bear complex sensory organs. The general characters of the jaws have\r\n  been mentioned above, and in detail there is great variation in these\r\n  organs among the different families. The sucking tongue of the\r\n  Hymenoptera has often been compared with the hypopharynx of other\r\n  insects. According to D. Sharp, however, the hypopharynx is present in\r\n  all Hymenoptera as a distinct structure at the base of the \"tongue,\"\r\n  which must be regarded as representing the fused laciniae of the\r\n  second maxillae. In the thorax the pronotum and prosternum are closely\r\n  associated with the mesothorax, but the pleura of the prothorax are\r\n  usually shifted far forwards, so that the fore-legs are inserted just\r\n  behind the head. A pair of small plates--the tegulae--are very\r\n  generally present at the bases of the fore-wings. The union of the\r\n  first abdominal segment with the metathorax has been already\r\n  mentioned. The second (so-called \"first\") abdominal segment is often\r\n  very constricted, forming the \"waist\" so characteristic of wasps and\r\n  ants for example. The constriction of this segment and its very\r\n  perfect articulation with the propodeum give great mobility to the\r\n  abdomen, so that the ovipositor or sting can be used with the greatest\r\n  possible accuracy and effect.\r\n\r\n  Mention has already been made of the series of curved hooks along the\r\n  costa of the hind-wing; by means of this arrangement the two wings of\r\n  a side are firmly joined together during flight, which thus becomes\r\n  particularly accurate. The wings in the Hymenoptera show a marked\r\n  reduction in the number of nervures as compared with more primitive\r\n  insects. The main median nervure, and usually also the sub-costal\r\n  become united with the radial, while the branches of radial, median\r\n  and cubital nervures pursuing a transverse or recurrent course across\r\n  the wing, divide its area into a number of areolets or \"cells,\" that\r\n  are of importance in classification. Among many of the smaller\r\n  Hymenoptera we find that the wings are almost destitute of nervures.\r\n  In the hind-wings--on account of their reduced size--the nervures are\r\n  even more reduced than in the fore-wings.\r\n\r\n  The legs of Hymenoptera are of the typical insectan form, and the foot\r\n  is usually composed of five segments. In many families the trochanter\r\n  appears to be represented by two small segments, there being thus an\r\n  extra joint in the leg. It is almost certain that the distal of these\r\n  two segments really belongs to the thigh, but the ordinary\r\n  nomenclature will be used in the present article, as this character is\r\n  of great importance in discriminating families, and the two segments\r\n  in question are referred to the trochanter by most systematic writers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After C. Janet, _Aiguillon de la Myrmica rubra_ (Paris,\r\n  1898).\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.--Ovipositor or Sting of Red Ant (_Myrmica rubra_) Queen.\r\n  Magnified. The right sheath C (outer process of the ninth abdominal\r\n  segment--9) is shown in connexion with the guide B formed by the inner\r\n  processes of the 9th segment. The stylet A (process of the 8th\r\n  abdominal segment--8) is turned over to show its groove a, which works\r\n  along the tongue or rail b.]\r\n\r\n  The typical insectan ovipositor, so well developed among the\r\n  Hymenoptera, consists of three pairs of processes (gonapophyses) two\r\n  of which belong to the ninth abdominal segment and one to the eighth.\r\n  The latter are the cutting or piercing stylets (fig. 5, A) of the\r\n  ovipositor, while the two outer processes of the ninth segment are\r\n  modified into sheaths or feelers (fig. 5, C) and the two inner\r\n  processes form a guide (fig. 5, B) on which the stylets work, tongues\r\n  or rails on the \"guide\" fitting accurately into longitudinal grooves\r\n  on the stylet. In the different families of the Hymenoptera, there are\r\n  various modifications of the ovipositor, in accord with the habits of\r\n  the insects and the purposes to which the organ is put. The sting of\r\n  wasps, ants and bees is a modified ovipositor and is used for\r\n  egg-laying by the fertile females, as well as for defence. Most male\r\n  Hymenoptera have processes which form claspers or genital armature.\r\n  These processes are not altogether homologous with those of the\r\n  ovipositor, being formed by inner and outer lobes of a pair of\r\n  structures on the ninth abdominal segment.\r\n\r\n  Many points of interest are to be noted in the internal structure of\r\n  the Hymenoptera. The gullet leads into a moderate-sized crop, and\r\n  several pairs of salivary glands open into the mouth. The crop is\r\n  followed by a proventriculus which, in the higher Hymenoptera, forms\r\n  the so-called \"honey stomach,\" by the contraction of whose wails the\r\n  solid and liquid food can be separated, passed on into the digestive\r\n  stomach, or held in the crop ready for regurgitation into the mouth.\r\n  Behind the digestive stomach are situated, as usual, intestine and\r\n  rectum, and the number of kidney (Malpighian) tubes varies from only\r\n  six to over a hundred, being usually great.\r\n\r\n  In the female, each ovary consists of a large number of ovarian tubes,\r\n  in which swollen chambers containing the egg-cells alternate with\r\n  smaller chambers enclosing nutrient material. In connexion with the\r\n  ovipositor are two poison-glands, one acid and the other alkaline in\r\n  its secretion. The acid gland consists of one, two or more tubes, with\r\n  a cellular coat of several layers, opening into a reservoir whence\r\n  the duct leads to the exterior. The alkaline gland is an irregular\r\n  tube with a single cellular layer, its duct opening alongside that of\r\n  the acid reservoir. These glands are most strongly developed when the\r\n  ovipositor is modified into a sting.\r\n\r\n  _Development._--Parthenogenesis is of normal occurrence in the\r\n  life-cycle of many Hymenoptera. There are species of gall-fly in which\r\n  males are unknown, the unfertilized eggs always developing into\r\n  females. On the other hand, in certain saw-flies and among the higher\r\n  families, the unfertilized eggs, capable of development, usually give\r\n  rise to male insects (see BEE). The larvae of most saw-flies feeding\r\n  on the leaves of plants are caterpillars (fig. 6, b) with numerous\r\n  abdominal pro-legs, but in most families of Hymenoptera the egg is\r\n  laid in such a situation that an abundant food-supply is assured\r\n  without exertion on the part of the larva, which is consequently a\r\n  legless grub, usually white in colour, and with soft flexible cuticle\r\n  (fig. 7, a). The organs and instincts for egg-laying and\r\n  food-providing are perhaps the most remarkable features in the economy\r\n  of the Hymenoptera. Gall-fly grubs are provided with vegetable food\r\n  through the eggs being laid by the mother insect within plant tissues.\r\n  The ichneumon pierces the body of a caterpillar and lays her eggs\r\n  where the grubs will find abundant animal food. A digging-wasp hunts\r\n  for insect prey and buries it with the egg, while a true wasp feeds\r\n  her brood with captured insects, as a bird her fledglings. Bees store\r\n  honey and pollen to serve as food for their young. Thus we find\r\n  throughout the order a degree of care for offspring unreached by other\r\n  insects, and this family-life has, in the best known of the\r\n  Hymenoptera--ants, wasps and bees--developed into an elaborate social\r\n  organization.\r\n\r\n_Social Life._--The development of a true insect society among the\r\nHymenoptera is dependent on a differentiation among the females between\r\nindividuals with well-developed ovaries (\"queens\") whose special\r\nfunction is reproduction; and individuals with reduced or aborted\r\novaries (\"workers\") whose duty is to build the nest, to gather food and\r\nto tend and feed the larvae. Among the wasps the workers may only differ\r\nfrom the queens in size, and individuals intermediate between the two\r\nforms of female may be met with. Further, the queen wasp, and also the\r\nqueen humble-bee, commences unaided the work of building and founding a\r\nnew nest, being afterwards helped by her daughters (the workers) when\r\nthese have been developed. In the hive-bee and among ants, on the other\r\nhand, there are constant structural distinctions between queen and\r\nworker, and the function of the queen bee in a hive is confined to\r\negg-laying, the labour of the community being entirely done by the\r\nworkers. Many ants possess several different forms of worker, adapted\r\nfor special duties. Details of this fascinating subject are given in the\r\nspecial articles ANT, BEE and WASP (q.v.).\r\n\r\n_Habits and Distribution._--Reference has been already made to the\r\nvarious methods of feeding practised by Hymenoptera in the larval stage,\r\nand the care taken of or for the young throughout the order leads in\r\nmany cases to the gathering of such food by the mother or nurse. Thus,\r\nwasps catch flies; worker ants make raids and carry off weak insects of\r\nmany kinds; bees gather nectar from flowers and transform it into honey\r\nwithin their stomachs--largely for the sake of feeding the larvae in the\r\nnest. The feeding habits of the adult may agree with that of the larva,\r\nor differ, as in the ease of wasps which feed their grubs on flies, but\r\neat principally vegetable food themselves. The nest-building habit is\r\nsimilarly variable. Digging wasps make simple holes in the ground; many\r\nburrowing bees form branching tunnels; other bees excavate timber or\r\nmake their brood-chambers in hollow plant-stems; wasps work up with\r\ntheir saliva vegetable fibres bitten off tree-bark to make paper; social\r\nbees produce from glands in their own bodies the wax whence their\r\nnest-chambers are built. The inquiline habit (\"cuckoo-parasitism\"), when\r\none species makes use of the labour of another by invading the nest and\r\nlaying her eggs there, is of frequent occurrence among Hymenoptera; and\r\nin some cases the larva of the intruder is not content with taking the\r\nstore of food provided, but attacks and devours the larva of the host.\r\n\r\nMost Hymenoptera are of moderate or small size, the giants of the\r\norder--certain saw-flies and tropical digging-wasps--never reach the bulk\r\nattained by the largest beetles, while the wing-spread is narrow compared\r\nwith that of many dragon-flies and moths. On the other hand, there are\r\nthousands of very small species, and the tiny \"fairy-flies\"\r\n(_Mymaridae_), whose larvae live as parasites in the eggs of various\r\ninsects, are excessively minute for creatures of such complex\r\norganization. Hymenoptera are probably less widely distributed than\r\nAptera, Coleoptera or Diptera, but they are to be found in all except the\r\nmost inhospitable regions of the globe. The order is, with few\r\nexceptions, terrestrial or aerial in habit. Comparatively only a few\r\nspecies are, for part of their lives, denizens of fresh water; these, as\r\nlarvae, are parasitic on the eggs or larvae of other aquatic insects, the\r\nlittle hymenopteron, _Polynema natans_, one of the \"fairy-flies\"--swims\r\nthrough the water by strokes of her delicate wings in search of a\r\ndragon-fly's egg in which to lay her own egg, while the rare _Agriotypus_\r\ndives after the case of a caddis-worm. It is of interest that the waters\r\nhave been invaded by the parasitic group of the Hymenoptera, since in\r\nnumber of species this is by far the largest of the order. No group of\r\nterrestrial insects escapes their attacks--even larvae boring in wood are\r\ndetected by ichneumon flies with excessively long ovipositors. Not a few\r\ncases are known in which a parasitic larva is itself pierced by the\r\novipositor of a \"hyperparasite,\" and even the offspring of the latter may\r\nitself fall a victim to the attack of a \"tertiary parasite.\"\r\n\r\n  _Fossil History._--Very little is known of the history of the\r\n  Hymenoptera previous to the Tertiary epoch, early in which, as we know\r\n  from the evidence of many Oligocene and Miocene fossils, all the more\r\n  important families had been differentiated. Fragments of wings from\r\n  the Lias and Oolitic beds have been referred to ants and bees, but the\r\n  true nature of these remains is doubtful.\r\n\r\n_Classification._--Linnaeus divided the Hymenoptera into two\r\nsections--the Terebrantia, whose females possess a cutting or piercing\r\novipositor, and the Aculeata, in which the female organ is modified into\r\na sting. This nomenclature was adopted by P. A. Latreille and has been\r\nin general use until the present day. A closely similar division of the\r\norder results from T. Hartig's character drawn from the\r\ntrochanter--whether of two segments or undivided--the groups being\r\ntermed respectively Ditrocha and Monotrocha. But the most natural\r\ndivision is obtained by the separation of the saw-flies as a primitive\r\nsub-order, characterized by the imperfect union of the first abdominal\r\nsegment with the thorax, and by the broad base of the abdomen, so that\r\nthere is no median constriction or \"waist,\" and by the presence of\r\nthoracic legs--usually also of abdominal pro-legs--in the larva. All the\r\nother families of Hymenoptera, including the gall-flies, ichneumons and\r\naculeates, have the first abdominal segment closely united with the\r\nthorax, the second abdominal segment constricted so as to form a narrow\r\nstalk or \"waist,\" and legless larvae without a hinder outlet to the\r\nfood-canal. These two sub-orders are usually known as the\r\n_Sessiliventra_ and _Petioliventra_ respectively, but the names\r\n_Symphyta_ and _Apocrita_ proposed in 1867 by C. Gerstaecker have\r\npriority, and should not be replaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Symphyta._\r\n\r\n  This sub-order, characterized by the \"sessile,\" broad-based abdomen,\r\n  whose first segment is imperfectly united with the thorax, and by the\r\n  usually caterpillar-like larvae with legs, includes the various groups\r\n  of saw-flies. Three leading families may be mentioned. The _Cephidae_,\r\n  or stem saw-flies, have an elongate pronotum, a compressed abdomen,\r\n  and a single spine on the shin of the fore-leg. The soft, white larvae\r\n  have the thoracic legs very small and feed in the stems of various\r\n  plants. _Cephus pygmaeus_ is a well-known enemy of corn crops. The\r\n  _Siricidae_ (\"wood-wasps\") are large elongate insects also with one\r\n  spine on each fore-shin, but with the pronotum closely joined to the\r\n  mesothorax. The ovipositor is long and prominent, enabling the female\r\n  insect to lay her eggs in the wood of trees, where the white larvae,\r\n  whose legs are excessively short, tunnel and feed. These insects are\r\n  adorned with bands of black and yellow, or with bright metallic\r\n  colours, and on account of their large size and formidable ovipositors\r\n  they often cause needless alarm to persons unfamiliar with their\r\n  habits. The _Tenthredinidae_, or true saw-flies, are distinguished by\r\n  two spines on each fore-shin, while the larvae are usually\r\n  caterpillars, with three pairs of thoracic legs, and from six to eight\r\n  pairs of abdominal pro-legs the latter not possessing the hooks found\r\n  on the pro-legs of lepidopterous caterpillars. Most saw-fly larvae\r\n  devour leaves, and the beautifully serrate processes of the ovipositor\r\n  are well adapted for egg-laying in plant tissues. Some saw-fly larvae\r\n  are protected by a slimy secretion (fig. 6, c) and a few live\r\n  concealed in galls. In the form of the feelers, the wing-neuration and\r\n  minor structural details there is much diversity among the saw-flies.\r\n  They have been usually regarded as a single family, but W. H. Ashmead\r\n  has lately differentiated eleven families of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Apocrita._\r\n\r\n  This sub-order includes the vast majority of the Hymenoptera,\r\n  characterized by the narrowly constricted waist in the adult and by\r\n  the legless condition of the larva. The trochanter is simple in some\r\n  genera and divided in others. With regard to the minor divisions of\r\n  this group, great difference of opinion has prevailed among students.\r\n  In his recent classification Ashmead (1901) recognizes seventy-nine\r\n  families arranged under eight \"super-families.\" The number of species\r\n  included in this division is enormous, and the multiplication of\r\n  families is, to some extent, a natural result of increasingly close\r\n  study. But the distinctions between many of these rest on\r\n  comparatively slight characters, and it is likely that the future\r\n  discovery of new genera may abolish many among such distinctions as\r\n  may now be drawn. It seems advisable, therefore, in the present\r\n  article to retain the wider conception of the family that has hitherto\r\n  contented most writers on the Hymenoptera. Ashmead's \"super-families\"\r\n  have, however, been adopted as--founded on definite structural\r\n  characters--they probably indicate relationship more nearly than the\r\n  older divisions founded mostly on habit. The Cynipoidea include the\r\n  gall-flies and their parasitic relations. In the Chalcidoidea,\r\n  Ichneumonoidea and Proctotrypoidea will be found nearly all the\r\n  \"parasitic Hymenoptera\" of older classifications. The Formicoidea are\r\n  the ants. The group of Fossores, or \"digging-wasps,\" is divided by\r\n  Ashmead, one section forming the Sphecoidea, while the other, together\r\n  with the Chrysidae and the true wasps, make up the Vespoidea. The\r\n  Apoidea consists of the bees only.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Marlatt, _Ent. Circ._ 26, U.S. Dept.

The feelers with twelve to fifteen segments\r\n  are thread-like and straight. All the insects included in this group\r\n  are small and form two families--the Cynipidae and the Figitidae. They\r\n  are the \"gall-flies,\" many of the species laying eggs in various\r\n  plant-tissues where the presence of the larva causes the formation of\r\n  a pathological growth or gall, always of a definite form and\r\n  characteristic of the species; the \"oak-apple\" and the bedeguar of\r\n  the rose are familiar examples. Other flies of this group have the\r\n  inquiline habit, laying their eggs in the galls of other species,\r\n  while others again pierce the cuticle of maggots or aphids, in whose\r\n  bodies their larvae live as parasites.\r\n\r\n  _Chalcidoidea._--This division resembles the Cynipoidea in the\r\n  position of the ovipositor, and in the two segmented trochanters. The\r\n  fore-wing also has no stigma, and the whole wing is almost destitute\r\n  of nervures and areolets, while the pronotum does not reach back to\r\n  the tegulae, and the feelers are elbowed (fig. 7). The vast majority\r\n  of this group, including nearly 5000 known species, are usually\r\n  reckoned as a single family, the _Chalcididae_, comprising small\r\n  insects, often of bright metallic colours, whose larvae are parasitic\r\n  in insects of various orders. The \"fig-insects,\" whose presence in\r\n  ripening figs is believed essential to the proper development of the\r\n  fruit, belong to _Blastophaga_ and other genera of this family. They\r\n  are remarkable in having wingless males and winged females. The\r\n  \"polyembryonic\" development of an _Encyrtus_, as studied by P.\r\n  Marchal, is highly remarkable. The female lays her egg in the egg of a\r\n  small ermine moth (_Hyponomeuta_) and the egg gives rise not to a\r\n  single embryo but to a hundred, which develop as the host-caterpillar\r\n  develops, being found at a later stage within the latter enveloped in\r\n  a flexible tube.\r\n\r\n  The _Mymaridae_ or \"fairy-flies\" are distinguished from the\r\n  _Chalcididae_ by their narrow fringed wings (figs. 4, 5) and by the\r\n  situation of the ovipositor just in front of the tip of the abdomen.\r\n  They are among the most minute of all insects and their larvae are\r\n  probably all parasitic in insects' eggs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Riley and Howard, _Insect Life_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.--Ichneumon Fly (_Rhyssa per-suasoria_) ovipositing.]\r\n\r\n  _Ichneumonoidea._--The ten thousand known species included in this\r\n  group agree with the Cynipoidea and Chalcidoidea in the position of\r\n  the ovipositor and in the jointed trochanters, but are distinguished\r\n  by the fore-wing possessing a distinct stigma and usually a typical\r\n  series of nervures and areolets (figs. 4, 8). Many of the species are\r\n  of fair size. They lay their eggs (fig. 8) in the bodies of insects\r\n  and their larvae belonging to various orders. A few small families\r\n  such as the _Evaniidae_ and the _Stephanidae_ are included here, but\r\n  the vast majority of the group fall into two large families, the\r\n  _Ichneumonidae_ and the _Braconidae_, the former distinguished by the\r\n  presence of two median (or discoidal) cells in the fore-wing (figs. 4,\r\n  7), while the latter has only one (figs. 4, 6). Not a few of these\r\n  insects, however, are entirely wingless. On account of their work in\r\n  destroying plant-eating insects, the ichneumon-flies are of great\r\n  economic importance.\r\n\r\n  _Proctotrypoidea._--This group may be distinguished from the preceding\r\n  by the position of the ovipositor at the extreme apex of the abdomen,\r\n  and from the groups that follow (with very few exceptions) by the\r\n  jointed trochanters of the legs. The pronotum reaches back to the\r\n  tegulae. The _Pelecinidae_--included here by Ashmead--are large\r\n  insects with remarkably elongate abdomens and undivided trochanters.\r\n  All the other members of the group may be regarded as forming a single\r\n  family--the _Proctotrypidae_, including an immense number of small\r\n  parasitic Hymenoptera, not a few of which are wingless. Of special\r\n  interest are the transformations of _Platygaster_, belonging to this\r\n  family, discovered by M. Ganin, and familiarized to English readers\r\n  through the writings of Sir J. Lubbock (Lord Avebury). The first larva\r\n  is broad in front and tapers behind to a \"tail\" provided with two\r\n  divergent processes, so that it resembles a small crustacean. It lives\r\n  in the grub of a gall-midge and it ultimately becomes changed into the\r\n  usual white and fleshy hymenopterous larva. The four succeeding\r\n  sections, in which the ovipositor is modified into a sting (always\r\n  exserted from the tip of the abdomen) and the trochanters are with few\r\n  exceptions simple, form the _Aculeata_ of Linnaeus.\r\n\r\n  _Formicoidea._--The ants which form this group are readily\r\n  distinguished by the differentiation of the females into winged\r\n  \"queens\" and wingless \"workers.\" The pronotum extends back to the\r\n  wing-bases, and the \"waist\" is greatly constricted and marked by one\r\n  or two \"nodes.\" The differentiation of the females leads to a complex\r\n  social life, the nesting habits of ants and the various industries\r\n  that they pursue being of surpassing interest (see ANT).\r\n\r\n  _Vespoidea._--This section includes a number of families characterized\r\n  by the backward extension of the prothorax to the tegulae and\r\n  distinguished from the ants by the absence of \"nodes\" at the base of\r\n  the abdomen. The true wasps have the fore-wings folded lengthwise when\r\n  at rest and the fore-legs of normal build--not specialized for\r\n  digging. The _Vespidae_ or social wasps have \"queens\" and \"workers\"\r\n  like the ants, but both these forms of female are winged; the claws on\r\n  their fret are simple. In the _Eumenidae_ or solitary wasps the female\r\n  sex is undifferentiated, and the foot claws are toothed. (For the\r\n  habits of these insects see WASP.) The _Chrysididae_ or ruby wasps are\r\n  small insects with a very hard cuticle exhibiting brilliant metallic\r\n  colours--blue, green and crimson. Only three or four abdominal\r\n  segments are visible, the hinder segments being slender and retracted\r\n  to form a telescope-like tube in which the ovipositor lies. When the\r\n  ovipositor is brought into use this tube is thrust out. The eggs are\r\n  laid in the nests of various bees and wasps, the chrysid larva living\r\n  as a \"cuckoo\" parasite. The _Trigonalidae_, a small family whose\r\n  larvae are parasitic in wasps' nests, also probably belong here.\r\n\r\n  The other families of the _Vespoidea_ belong to the series of\r\n  \"Fossores\" or digging-wasps. In two of the families--the _Mutillidae_\r\n  and _Thynnidae_--the females are wingless and the larvae live as\r\n  parasites in the larvae of other insects; the female _Mutilla_ enters\r\n  bumble-bees' nests and lays her eggs in the bee-grubs. In the other\r\n  families both sexes are winged, and the instinct and industry of the\r\n  females are among the most wonderful in the Hymenoptera. They make\r\n  burrows wherein they place insects or spiders which they have caught\r\n  and stung, laying their eggs beside the victim so that the young\r\n  larvae find themselves in presence of an abundant and appropriate\r\n  food-supply. Valuable observations on the habits of these insects are\r\n  due to J. H. Fabre and G. W. and E. Peckham. The prey is sometimes\r\n  stung in the neighbourhood of the nerve ganglia, so that it is\r\n  paralysed but not killed, the grub of the fossorial wasp devouring its\r\n  victim alive; but this instinct varies in perfection, and in many\r\n  cases the larva flourishes equally whether its prey be killed or not.\r\n  The females have a wonderful power of finding their burrows on\r\n  returning from their hunting expeditions. Among the Vespoid families\r\n  of fossorial wasps, the _Pompilidae_ are the most important. They are\r\n  recognizable by their slender and elongate hind-legs; many of them\r\n  provision their burrows with spiders. The _Sapygidae_ are parasitic on\r\n  bees, while the _Scoliidae_ are large, robust and hairy insects, many\r\n  of which prey upon the grubs of chafers.\r\n\r\n  _Sphecoidea._--In this division are included the rest of the\r\n  \"digging-wasps,\" distinguished from the _Vespoidea_ by the short\r\n  pronotum not reaching backward to the tegulae. They have usually been\r\n  reckoned as forming a single, very large family--the _Sphegidae_--but\r\n  ten or twelve subdivisions of the group are regarded as distinct\r\n  families by Ashmead and others. Great diversity is shown in the\r\n  details of structure, habits and nature of the prey. Species of\r\n  _Sphex_, studied by Fabre, provisioned their brood-chambers with\r\n  crickets. _Pelopoeus_ hunts spiders, while _Ammophila_ catches\r\n  caterpillars for the benefit of her young. Fabre states that the\r\n  last-named insect uses a stone for the temporary closing of her\r\n  burrow, and the Peckhams have seen a female _Ammophila_ take a stone\r\n  between her mandibles and use it as a hammer for pounding down the\r\n  earth over her finished nest. The habits of _Bembex_ are of especial\r\n  interest. The female, instead of provisioning her burrow with a supply\r\n  of food that will suffice the larva for its whole life, brings fresh\r\n  flies with which she regularly feeds her young. In this instinct we\r\n  have a correspondence with the habits of social wasps and bees. Yet it\r\n  may be thought that the usual instinct of the \"digging-wasps\" to\r\n  capture and store up food in an underground burrow for the benefit of\r\n  offspring which they will never see is even more surprising. The habit\r\n  of some genera is to catch the prey before making their tunnel, but\r\n  more frequently the insect digs her nest, and then hunts for prey to\r\n  put into it.\r\n\r\n  _Apoidea._--The bees which make up this group agree with the\r\n  Sphecoidea in the short pronotum, but may be distinguished from all\r\n  other Hymenoptera by the widened first tarsal segment and the plumose\r\n  hairs on head and body. They are usually regarded as forming a single\r\n  family--the _Apidae_--but there is very great diversity in structural\r\n  details, and Ashmead divides them into fourteen families. The\r\n  \"tongue,\" for example, is short and obtuse or emarginate in _Colletes_\r\n  and _Prosopis_, while in all other bees it is pointed at the tip. But\r\n  in _Andrena_ and its allies it is comparatively short, while in the\r\n  higher genera, such as _Apis_ and _Bombus_, it is elongate and\r\n  flexible, forming a most elaborate and perfect organ for taking liquid\r\n  food. Bees feed on honey and pollen. Most of the genera are \"solitary\"\r\n  in habit, the female sex being undifferentiated; but among the\r\n  humble-bees and hive-bees we find, as in social wasps and ants, the\r\n  occurrence of workers, and the consequent elaboration of a wonderful\r\n  insect-society.

Monte Matto, hence the modern name Trello Vouni), a\r\nmountain in Attica, bounding the Athenian plain on the S.E. Height, 3370\r\nft. It was famous in ancient times for its bees, which gathered honey of\r\npeculiar flavour from its aromatic herbs; their fame still persists. The\r\nspring mentioned by Ovid (_Ars Amat._ iii. 687) is probably to be\r\nrecognized near the monastery of Syriani or Kaesariani on the western\r\nslope. This may be identical with that known as [Greek: Kyllon Pêra],\r\nsaid to be a remedy for barrenness in women. The marble of Hymettus,\r\nwhich often has a bluish tinge, was used extensively for building in\r\nancient Athens, and also, in early times, for sculpture; but the white\r\nmarble of Pentelicus was preferred for both purposes.\r\n\r\n  See E. Dodwell, _Classical and Topographical Tour_ (1819), i. 483.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYMNS.--1. _Classical Hymnody._--The word \"hymn\" ([Greek: hymnos]) was\r\nemployed by the ancient Greeks[1] to signify a song or poem composed in\r\nhonour of gods, heroes or famous men, or to be recited on some joyful,\r\nmournful or solemn occasion. Polymnia was the name of their lyric muse.\r\nHomer makes Alcinous entertain Odysseus with a \"hymn\" of the minstrel\r\nDemodocus, on the capture of Troy by the wooden horse. The _Works and\r\nDays_ of Hesiod begins with an invocation to the Muses to address hymns\r\nto Zeus, and in his _Theogonia_ he speaks of them as singing or\r\ninspiring \"hymns\" to all the divinities, and of the bard as \"their\r\nservant, hymning the glories of men of old, and of the gods of Olympus.\"\r\nPindar calls by this name odes, like his own, in praise of conquerors at\r\nthe public games of Greece. The Athenian dramatists (Euripides most\r\nfrequently) use the word and its cognate verbs in a similar manner; they\r\nalso describe by them metrical oracles and apophthegms, martial, festal\r\nand hymeneal songs, dirges and lamentations or incantations of woe.\r\n\r\nHellenic hymns, according to this conception of them, have come down to\r\nus, some from a very early and others from a late period of Greek\r\nclassical literature. Those which passed by the name of Homer[2] were\r\nalready old in the time of Thucydides. They are mythological poems\r\n(several of them long), in hexameter verse--some very interesting. That\r\nto Apollo contains a traditionary history of the origin and progress of\r\nthe Delphic worship; those on Hermes and on Dionysus are marked by much\r\nliveliness and poetical fancy. Hymns of a like general character, but of\r\nless interest (though these also embody some fine poetical traditions of\r\nthe Greek mythology, such as the story of Teiresias, and that of the\r\nwanderings of Leto), were written in the 3rd century before Christ, by\r\nCallimachus of Cyrene. Cleanthes, the successor of Zeno, composed (also\r\nin hexameters) an \"excellent and devout hymn\" (as it is justly called by\r\nCudworth, in his _Intellectual System_) to Zeus, which is preserved in\r\nthe _Eclogae_ of Stobaeus, and from which Aratus borrowed the words,\r\n\"For we are also His offspring,\" quoted by St Paul at Athens. The\r\nso-called Orphic hymns, in hexameter verse, styled [Greek: teletai], or\r\nhymns of initiation into the \"mysteries\" of the Hellenic religion, are\r\nproductions of the Alexandrian school,--as to which learned men are not\r\nagreed whether they are earlier or later than the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe Romans did not adopt the word \"hymn\"; nor have we many Latin poems\r\nof the classical age to which it can properly be applied. There are,\r\nhowever, a few--such as the simple and graceful \"Dianae sumus in fide\"\r\n(\"Dian's votaries are we\") of Catullus, and \"Dianam tenerae dicite\r\nvirgines\" (\"Sing to Dian, gentle maidens\") of Horace--which approach\r\nmuch more nearly than anything Hellenic to the form and character of\r\nmodern hymnody.\r\n\r\n2. _Hebrew Hymnody._--For the origin and idea of Christian hymnody we\r\nmust look, not to Gentile, but to Hebrew sources. St Augustine's\r\ndefinition of a hymn, generally accepted by Christian antiquity, may be\r\nsummed up in the words, \"praise to God with song\" (\"cum cantico\"); Bede\r\nunderstood the \"canticum\" as properly requiring metre; though he thought\r\nthat what in its original language was a true hymn might retain that\r\ncharacter in an unmetrical translation. Modern use has enlarged the\r\ndefinition; Roman Catholic writers extend it to the praises of saints;\r\nand the word now comprehends rhythmical prose as well as verse, and\r\nprayer and spiritual meditation as well as praise.\r\n\r\nThe modern distinction between psalms and hymns is arbitrary (see\r\nPSALMS). The former word was used by the LXX. as a generic designation,\r\nprobably because it implied an accompaniment by the psaltery (said by\r\nEusebius to have been of very ancient use in the East) or other\r\ninstruments. The cognate verb \"psallere\" has been constantly applied to\r\nhymns, both in the Eastern and in the Western Church; and the same\r\ncompositions which they described generically as \"psalms\" were also\r\ncalled by the LXX. \"odes\" (i.e. songs) and \"hymns.\" The latter word\r\noccurs, e.g. in Ps. lxxii. 20 (\"the hymns of David the son of Jesse\"),\r\nin Ps. lxv. 1, and also in the Greek titles of the 6th, 54th, 55th, 67th\r\nand 76th (this numbering of the psalms being that of the English\r\nversion, not of the LXX.). The 44th chapter of Ecclesiasticus, \"Let us\r\nnow praise famous men,\" &c., is entitled in the Greek [Greek: paterôn\r\nhymnos], \"The Fathers' Hymn.\" Bede speaks of the whole book of Psalms as\r\ncalled \"liber hymnorum,\" by the universal consent of Hebrews, Greeks and\r\nLatins.\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament we find our Lord and His apostles singing a hymn\r\n([Greek: hymnêsantes exêlthon]), after the institution of the Lord's\r\nSupper; St Paul and Silas doing the same ([Greek: hymnoun ton theon]) in\r\ntheir prison at Philippi; St James recommending psalm-singing ([Greek:\r\npsalletô]), and St Paul \"psalms and hymns and spiritual songs\" ([Greek:\r\npsalmois kai hymnois kai ôdais pneumatikais]) St Paul also, in the 14th\r\nchapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians, speaks of singing\r\n([Greek: psalô]) and of every man's psalm ([Greek: hekastos hymôn\r\npsalmon echei]). In a context which plainly has reference to the\r\nassemblies of the Corinthian Christians for common worship. All the\r\nwords thus used were applied by the LXX. to the Davidical psalms; it is\r\ntherefore possible that these only may be intended, in the different\r\nplaces to which we have referred. But there are in St Paul's epistles\r\nseveral passages (Eph. v. 14; 1 Tim. iii. 16; 1 Tim. vi. 15, 16; 2 Tim.\r\nii. 11, 12) which have so much of the form and character of later\r\nOriental hymnody as to have been supposed by Michaelis and others to be\r\nextracts from original hymns of the Apostolic age. Two of them are\r\napparently introduced as quotations, though not found elsewhere in the\r\nScriptures. A third has not only rhythm, but rhyme. The thanksgiving\r\nprayer of the assembled disciples, recorded in Acts iv., is both in\r\nsubstance and in manner poetical; and in the canticles, \"Magnificat,\"\r\n\"Benedictus,\" &c., which manifestly followed the form and style of\r\nHebrew poetry, hymns or songs, proper for liturgical use, have always\r\nbeen recognized by the church.\r\n\r\n3. _Eastern Church Hymnody._--The hymn of our Lord, the precepts of the\r\napostles, the angelic song at the nativity, and \"Benedicite omnia opera\"\r\nare referred to in a curious metrical prologue to the hymnary of the\r\nMozarabic Breviary as precedents for the practice of the Western Church.\r\nIn this respect, however, the Western Church followed the Eastern, in\r\nwhich hymnody prevailed from the earliest times.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Therapeutae.\r\n\r\nPhilo describes the Theraputae (q.v.) of the neighbourhood of Alexandria\r\nas composers of original hymns, which (as well as old) were sung at\r\ntheir great religious festivals--the people listening in silence till\r\nthey came to the closing strains, or refrains, at the end of a hymn or\r\nstanza (the \"acroteleutia\" and \"ephymnia\"), in which all, women as well\r\nas men, heartily joined. These songs, he says, were in various metres\r\n(for which he uses a number of technical terms); some were choral, some\r\nnot; and they were divided into variously constructed strophes or\r\nstanzas. Eusebius, who thought that the Theraputae were communities of\r\nChristians, says that the Christian practice of his own day was in exact\r\naccordance with this description.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Antiphonal singing.\r\n\r\nThe practice, not only of singing hymns, but of singing them\r\nantiphonally, appears, from the well-known letter of Pliny to Trajan, to\r\nhave been established in the Bithynian churches at the beginning of the\r\n2nd century. They were accustomed \"stato die ante lucem convenire,\r\ncarmenque Christo, quasi Deo, dicere _secum invicem_.\" This agrees well,\r\nin point of time, with the tradition recorded by the historian Socrates,\r\nthat Ignatius (who suffered martyrdom about A.D. 107) was led by a\r\nvision or dream of angels singing hymns in that manner to the Holy\r\nTrinity to introduce antiphonal singing into the church of Antioch, from\r\nwhich it quickly spread to other churches. There seems to be an allusion\r\nto choral singing in the epistle of Ignatius himself to the Romans,\r\nwhere he exhorts them, \"[Greek: choros genomenoi]\" (\"having formed\r\nthemselves into a choir\"), to \"sing praise to the Father in Christ\r\nJesus.\" A statement of Theodoret has sometimes been supposed to refer\r\nthe origin of antiphonal singing to a much later date; but this seems to\r\nrelate only to the singing of Old Testament Psalms ([Greek: tên\r\nDauidikên melôdian]), the alternate chanting of which, by a choir\r\ndivided into two parts, was (according to that statement) first\r\nintroduced into the church of Antioch by two monks famous in the history\r\nof their time, Flavianus and Diodorus, under the emperor Constantius II.\r\n\r\n\r\n  2nd century.\r\n\r\n  3rd century.\r\n\r\nOther evidence of the use of hymns in the 2nd century is contained in a\r\nfragment of Caius, preserved by Eusebius, which refers to \"all the\r\npsalms and odes written by faithful brethren from the beginning,\" as\r\n\"hymning Christ, the Word of God, as God.\" Tertullian also, in his\r\ndescription of the \"Agapae,\" or love-feasts, of his day, says that,\r\nafter washing hands and bringing in lights, each man was invited to come\r\nforward and sing to God's praise something either taken from the\r\nScriptures or of his own composition (\"ut quisque de Sacris Scripturis\r\nvel proprio ingenio potest\"). George Bull, bishop of St David's,\r\nbelieved one of those primitive compositions to be the hymn appended by\r\nClement of Alexandria to his _Paedagogus_; and Archbishop Ussher\r\nconsidered the ancient morning and evening hymns, of which the use was\r\nenjoined by the _Apostolical Constitutions_, and which are also\r\nmentioned in the \"Tract on Virginity\" printed with the works of St\r\nAthanasius, and in St Basil's treatise upon the Holy Spirit, to belong\r\nto the same family. Clement's hymn, in a short anapaestic metre,\r\nbeginning [Greek: stomion pôlôn adaôn] (or, according to some editions,\r\n[Greek: basileu hagiôn, loge pandamatôr]--translated by the Rev. A.\r\nChatfield, \"O Thou, the King of Saints, all-conquering Word\"), is rapid,\r\nspirited and well-adapted for singing. The Greek \"Morning Hymn\" (which,\r\nas divided into verses by Archbishop Ussher in his treatise _De\r\nSymbolis_, has a majestic rhythm, resembling a choric or dithyrambic\r\nstrophe) is the original form of \"Gloria in Excelsis,\" still said or\r\nsung, with some variations, in all branches of the church which have not\r\nrelinquished the use of liturgies. The Latin form of this hymn (of which\r\nthat in the English communion office is an exact translation) is said,\r\nby Bede and other ancient writers, to have been brought into use at Rome\r\nby Pope Telesphorus, as early as the time of the emperor Hadrian. A\r\nthird, the Vesper or \"Lamp-lighting\" hymn (\"[Greek: phôs hilaron hagias\r\ndoxês]\"--translated by Canon Bright \"Light of Gladness, Beam Divine\"),\r\nholds its place to this day in the services of the Greek rite. In the\r\n3rd century Origen seems to have had in his mind the words of some other\r\nhymns or hymn of like character, when he says (in his treatise _Against\r\nCelsus_): \"We glorify in hymns God and His only begotten Son; as do also\r\nthe Sun, the Moon, the Stars and all the host of heaven. All these, in\r\none Divine chorus, with the just among men, glorify in hymns God who is\r\nover all, and His only begotten Son.\" So highly were these compositions\r\nesteemed in the Syrian churches that the council which deposed Paul of\r\nSamosata from the see of Antioch in the time of Aurelian justified that\r\nact, in its synodical letter to the bishops of Rome and Alexandria, on\r\nthis ground (among others) that he had prohibited the use of hymns of\r\nthat kind, by uninspired writers, addressed to Christ.\r\n\r\nAfter the conversion of Constantine, the progress of hymnody became\r\nclosely connected with church controversies. There had been in Edessa,\r\nat the end of the 2nd or early in the 3rd century, a Gnostic writer of\r\nconspicuous ability, named Bardesanes, who was succeeded, as the head of\r\nhis sect or school, by his son Harmonius. Both father and son wrote\r\nhymns, and set them to agreeable melodies, which acquired, and in the\r\n4th century still retained, much local popularity. Ephraem Syrus, the\r\nfirst voluminous hymn-writer whose works remain to us, thinking that the\r\nsame melodies might be made useful to the faith, if adapted to more\r\northodox words, composed to them a large number of hymns in the Syriac\r\nlanguage, principally in tetrasyllabic, pentasyllable and heptasyllabic\r\nmetres, divided into strophes of from 4 to 12, 16 and even 20 lines\r\neach. When a strophe contained five lines, the fifth was generally an\r\n\"ephymnium,\" detached in sense, and consisting of a prayer, invocation,\r\ndoxology or the like, to be sung antiphonally, either in full chorus or\r\nby a separate part of the choir. The _Syriac Chrestomathy_ of August\r\nHahn (Leipzig, 1825), and the third volume of H. A. Daniel's _Thesaurus\r\nHymnologicus_ (Leipzig, 1841-1856), contain specimens of these hymns.\r\nSome of them have been translated into (unmetrical) English by the Rev.\r\nHenry Burgess (_Select Metrical Hymns of Ephrem Syrus_, &c., 1853). A\r\nconsiderable number of those so translated are on subjects connected\r\nwith death, resurrection, judgment, &c., and display not only Christian\r\nfaith and hope, but much simplicity and tenderness of natural feeling.\r\nTheodoret speaks of the spiritual songs of Ephraem as very sweet and\r\nprofitable, and as adding much, in his (Theodoret's) time, to the\r\nbrightness of the commemorations of martyrs in the Syrian Church.\r\n\r\nThe Greek hymnody contemporary with Ephraem followed, with some licence,\r\nclassical models. One of its favourite metres was the Anacreontic; but\r\nit also made use of the short anapaestic, Ionic, iambic and other\r\nlyrical measures, as well as the hexameter and pentameter. Its principal\r\nauthors were Methodius, bishop of Olympus, who died about A.D. 311,\r\nSynesius, who became bishop of Ptolemais in Cyrenaica in 410, and\r\nGregory Nazianzen, for a short time (380-381) patriarch of\r\nConstantinople. The merits of these writers have been perhaps too much\r\ndepreciated by the admirers of the later Greek \"Melodists.\" They have\r\nfound an able English translator in the Rev. Allen Chatfield (_Songs and\r\nHymns of Earliest Greek Christian Poets_, London, 1876). Among the most\r\nstriking of their works are [Greek: mnôeo Christe] (\"Lord Jesus, think\r\nof me\"), by Synesius; [Greek: se ton aphthiton monarchên] (\"O Thou, the\r\nOne Supreme\") and [Greek: ti soi theleis genesthai] (\"O soul of mine,\r\nrepining\"), by Gregory; also [Greek: anôthen parthenoi] (\"The Bridegroom\r\ncometh\"), by Methodius. There continued to be Greek metrical\r\nhymn-writers, in a similar style, till a much later date. Sophronius,\r\npatriarch of Jerusalem in the 7th century, wrote seven Anacreontic\r\nhymns; and St John Damascene, one of the most copious of the second\r\nschool of \"Melodists,\" was also the author of some long compositions in\r\ntrimeter iambics.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Period of Arian controversy.\r\n\r\nAn important development of hymnody at Constantinople arose out of the\r\nArian controversy. Early in the 4th century Athanasius had rebuked, not\r\nonly the doctrine of Arius, but the light character of certain hymns by\r\nwhich he endeavoured to make that doctrine popular. When, towards the\r\nclose of that century (398), St John Chrysostom was raised to the\r\nmetropolitan see, the Arians, who were still numerous at Constantinople,\r\nhad no places of worship within the walls; but they were in the habit of\r\ncoming into the city at sunset on Saturdays, Sundays and the greater\r\nfestivals, and congregating in the porticoes and other places of public\r\nresort, where they sung, all night through, antiphonal songs, with\r\n\"acroteleutia\" (closing strains, or refrains), expressive of Arian\r\ndoctrine, often accompanied by taunts and insults to the orthodox.\r\nChrysostom was apprehensive that this music might draw some of the\r\nsimpler church people to the Arian side; he therefore organized, in\r\nopposition to it, under the patronage and at the cost of Eudoxia, the\r\nempress of Arcadius (then his friend), a system of nightly processional\r\nhymn-singing, with silver crosses, wax-lights and other circumstances of\r\nceremonial pomp. Riots followed, with bloodshed on both sides, and with\r\nsome personal injury to the empress's chief eunuch, who seems to have\r\nofficiated as conductor or director of the church musicians. This led to\r\nthe suppression, by an imperial edict, of all public Arian singing;\r\nwhile in the church the practice of nocturnal hymn-singing on certain\r\nsolemn occasions, thus first introduced, remained an established\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Greek system of hymnody.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that some rudiments of the peculiar system of\r\nhymnody which now prevails throughout the Greek communion, and whose\r\naffinities are rather to the Hebrew and Syriac than to the classical\r\nforms, may have existed in the church of Constantinople, even at that\r\ntime. Anatolius, patriarch of Constantinople in the middle of the 5th\r\ncentury, was the precursor of that system; but the reputation of being\r\nits proper founder belongs to Romanos, of whom little more is known than\r\nthat he wrote hymns still extant, and lived towards the end of that\r\ncentury. The importance of that system in the services of the Greek\r\nchurch may be understood from the fact that Dr J. M. Neale computed\r\nfour-fifths of the whole space (about 5000 pages) contained in the\r\ndifferent service-books of that church to be occupied by hymnody, all in\r\na language or dialect which has ceased to be anywhere spoken.\r\n\r\n  The system has a peculiar technical terminology, in which the words\r\n  \"troparion,\" \"ode,\" \"canon\" and \"hirmus\" ([Greek: eirmos]) chiefly\r\n  require explanation.\r\n\r\n  The _troparion_ is the unit of the system, being a strophe or stanza,\r\n  seen, when analysed, to be divisible into verses or clauses, with\r\n  regulated caesuras, but printed in the books as a single prose\r\n  sentence, without marking any divisions. The following (turned into\r\n  English, from a \"canon\" by John Mauropus) may be taken as an example:\r\n  \"The never-sleeping Guardian, | the patron of my soul, | the guide of\r\n  my life, | allotted me by God, | I hymn thee, Divine Angel | of\r\n  Almighty God.\" Dr Neale and most other writers regard all these\r\n  \"troparia\" as rhythmical or modulated prose. Cardinal J. B. Pitra, on\r\n  the other hand, who in 1867 and 1876 published two learned works on\r\n  this subject, maintains that they are really metrical, and governed by\r\n  definite rules of prosody, of which he lays down sixteen. According to\r\n  him, each \"troparion\" contains from three to thirty-three verses; each\r\n  verse varies from two to thirteen syllables, often in a continuous\r\n  series, uniform, alternate or reciprocal, the metre being always\r\n  syllabic, and depending, not on the quantity of vowels or the position\r\n  of consonants, but on an harmonic series of accents.\r\n\r\n  In various parts of the services solitary troparia are sung, under\r\n  various names, \"contacion,\" \"oecos,\" \"cathisma,\" &c., which mark\r\n  distinctions either in their character or in their use.\r\n\r\n  An _ode_ is a song or hymn compounded of several similar\r\n  \"troparia,\"--usually three, four or five. To these is always prefixed\r\n  a typical or standard \"troparion,\" called the _hirmus_, by which the\r\n  syllabic measure, the periodic series of accents, and in fact the\r\n  whole structure and rhythm of the stanzas which follow it are\r\n  regulated. Each succeeding \"troparion\" in the same \"ode\" contains the\r\n  same number of verses, and of syllables in each verse, and similar\r\n  accents on the same or equivalent syllables. The \"hirmus\" may either\r\n  form the first stanza of the \"ode\" itself, or (as is more frequently\r\n  the case) may be taken from some other piece; and, when so taken, it\r\n  is often indicated by initial words only, without being printed at\r\n  length. It is generally printed within commas, after the proper rubric\r\n  of the \"ode.\" A hymn in irregular \"stichera\" or stanzas, without a\r\n  \"hirmus,\" is called \"idiomelon.\" A system of three or four odes is\r\n  \"triodion\" or \"tetraodion.\"\r\n\r\n  A _canon_ is a system of eight (theoretically nine) connected odes,\r\n  the second being always suppressed. Various pauses, relieved by the\r\n  interposition of other short chants or readings, occur during the\r\n  singing of a whole \"canon.\" The final \"troparion\" in each ode of the\r\n  series is not unfrequently detached in sense (like the \"ephymnia\" of\r\n  Ephraem Syrus), particularly when it is in the (very common) form of a\r\n  \"theotokion,\" or ascription of praise to the mother of our Lord, and\r\n  when it is a recurring refrain or burden.\r\n\r\nThere were two principal periods of Greek hymnography constructed on\r\nthese principles--the first that of Romanos and his followers, extending\r\nover the 6th and 7th centuries, the second that of the schools which\r\narose during the Iconoclastic controversy in the 8th century, and which\r\ncontinued for some centuries afterwards, until the art itself died out.\r\n\r\n\r\n  School of Romanos.\r\n\r\nThe works of the writers of the former period were collected in\r\n_Tropologia_, or church hymn-books, which were held in high esteem till\r\nthe 10th century, when they ceased to be regarded as church-books, and\r\nso fell into neglect. They are now preserved only in a very small number\r\nof manuscripts. From three of these, belonging to public libraries at\r\nMoscow, Turin and Rome, Cardinal Pitra has printed, in his _Analecta_, a\r\nnumber of interesting examples, the existence of which appears to have\r\nbeen unknown to Dr Neale, and which, in the cardinal's estimation, are\r\nin many respects superior to the \"canons,\" &c., of the modern Greek\r\nservice-books, from which all Neale's translations (except some from\r\nAnatolius) are taken. Cardinal Pitra's selections include twenty-nine\r\nworks by Romanos, and some by Sergius, and nine other known, as well as\r\nsome unknown, authors. He describes them as having generally a more\r\ndramatic character than the \"melodies\" of the later period, and a much\r\nmore animated style; and he supposes that they may have been originally\r\nsung with dramatic accompaniments, by way of substitution for the\r\ntheatrical performances of Pagan times. As an instance of their peculiar\r\ncharacter, he mentions a Christmas or Epiphany hymn by Romanos, in\r\ntwenty-five long strophes, in which there is, first, an account of the\r\nNativity and its accompanying wonders, and then a dialogue between the\r\nwise men, the Virgin mother and Joseph. The magi arrive, are admitted,\r\ndescribe the moral and religious condition of Persia and the East, and\r\nthe cause and adventures of their journey, and then offer their gifts.\r\nThe Virgin intercedes for them with her Son, instructs them in some\r\nparts of Jewish history, and ends with a prayer for the salvation of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Melodists.\r\n\r\nThe controversies and persecutions of the 8th and succeeding centuries\r\nturned the thoughts of the \"melodists\" of the great monasteries of the\r\nStudium at Constantinople and St Saba in Palestine and their followers,\r\nand those of the adherents of the Greek rite in Sicily and South Italy\r\n(who suffered much from the Saracens and the Normans), into a less\r\npicturesque but more strictly theological course; and the influence of\r\nthose controversies, in which the final success of the cause of \"Icons\"\r\nwas largely due to the hymns, as well as to the courage and sufferings,\r\nof these confessors, was probably the cause of their supplanting, as\r\nthey did, the works of the older school. Cardinal Pitra gives them the\r\npraise of having discovered a graver and more solemn style of chant, and\r\nof having done much to fix the dogmatic theology of their church upon\r\nits present lines of near approach to the Roman.\r\n\r\nAmong the \"melodists\" of this latter Greek school there were many saints\r\nof the Greek church, several patriarchs and two emperors--Leo the\r\nPhilosopher, and Constantine Porphyrogenitus, his son. Their greatest\r\npoets were Theodore and Joseph of the Studium, and Cosmas and John\r\n(called Damascene) of St Saba. Neale translated into English verse\r\nseveral selected portions, or centoes, from the works of these and\r\nothers, together with four selections from earlier works by Anatolius.\r\nSome of his translations--particularly \"The day is past and over,\" from\r\nAnatolius, and \"Christian, dost thou see them,\" from Andrew of\r\nCrete--have been adopted into hymn-books used in many English churches;\r\nand the hymn \"Art thou weary,\" which is rather founded upon than\r\ntranslated from one by Stephen the Sabaite, has obtained still more\r\ngeneral popularity.\r\n\r\n4. _Western Church Hymnody._--It was not till the 4th century that Greek\r\nhymnody was imitated in the West, where its introduction was due to two\r\ngreat lights of the Latin Church--St Hilary of Poitiers and St Ambrose\r\nof Milan.\r\n\r\nHilary was banished from his see of Poitiers in 356, and was absent from\r\nit for about four years, which he spent in Asia Minor, taking part\r\nduring that time in one of the councils of the Eastern Church. He thus\r\nhad full opportunity of becoming acquainted with the Greek church music\r\nof that day; and he wrote (as St Jerome, who was thirty years old when\r\nHilary died, and who was well acquainted with his acts and writings, and\r\nspent some time in or near his diocese, informs us) a \"book of hymns,\"\r\nto one of which Jerome particularly refers, in the preface to the second\r\nbook of his own commentary on the epistle to the Galatians. Isidore,\r\narchbishop of Seville, who presided over the fourth council of Toledo,\r\nin his book on the offices of the church, speaks of Hilary as the first\r\nLatin hymn-writer; that council itself, in its 13th canon, and the\r\nprologue to the Mozarabic hymnary (which is little more than a\r\nversification of the canon), associate his name, in this respect, with\r\nthat of Ambrose. A tradition, ancient and widely spread, ascribed to him\r\nthe authorship of the remarkable \"Hymnum dicat turba fratrum, hymnum\r\ncantus personet\" (\"Band of brethren, raise the hymn, let your song the\r\nhymn resound\"), which is a succinct narrative, in hymnal form, of the\r\nwhole gospel history; and is perhaps the earliest example of a strictly\r\ndidactic hymn. Both Bede and Hincmar much admired this composition,\r\nthough the former does not mention, in connexion with it, the name of\r\nHilary. The private use of hymns of such a character by Christians in\r\nthe West may probably have preceded their ecclesiastical use; for Jerome\r\nsays that in his day those who went into the fields might hear \"the\r\nploughman at his hallelujahs, the mower at his hymns, and the\r\nvine-dresser singing David's psalms.\" Besides this, seven shorter\r\nmetrical hymns attributed to Hilary are still extant.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ambrose.\r\n\r\nOf the part taken by Ambrose, not long after Hilary's death, in bringing\r\nthe use of hymns into the church of Milan, we have a contemporary\r\naccount from his convert, St Augustine. Justina, mother of the emperor\r\nValentinian, favoured the Arians, and desired to remove Ambrose from his\r\nsee. The \"devout people,\" of whom Augustine's mother, Monica, was one,\r\ncombined to protect him, and kept guard in the church. \"Then,\" says\r\nAugustine, \"it was first appointed that, after the manner of the Eastern\r\nchurches, hymns and psalms should be sung, lest the people should grow\r\nweary and faint through sorrow; which custom has ever since been\r\nretained, and has been followed by almost all congregations in other\r\nparts of the world.\" He describes himself as moved to tears by the\r\nsweetness of these \"hymns and canticles\":--\"The voices flowed into my\r\nears; the truth distilled into my heart; I overflowed with devout\r\naffections, and was happy.\" To this time, according to an uncertain but\r\nnot improbable tradition which ascribed the composition of the \"Te Deum\"\r\nto Ambrose, and connected it with the conversion of Augustine, is to be\r\nreferred the commencement of the use in the church of that sublime\r\nunmetrical hymn.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, to be assumed that the hymnody thus introduced by\r\nAmbrose was from the first used according to the precise order and\r\nmethod of the later Western ritual. To bring it into (substantially)\r\nthat order and method appears to have been the work of St Benedict.\r\nWalafrid Strabo, the earliest ecclesiastical writer on this subject (who\r\nlived at the beginning of the 9th century), says that Benedict, on the\r\nconstitution of the religious order known by his name (about 530),\r\nappointed the Ambrosian hymns to be regularly sung in his offices for\r\nthe canonical hours. Hence probably originated the practice of the\r\nItalian churches, and of others which followed their example, to sing\r\ncertain hymns (Ambrosian, or by the early successors of the Ambrosian\r\nschool) daily throughout the week, at \"Vespers,\" \"Lauds\" and \"Nocturns,\"\r\nand on some days at \"Compline\" also--varying them with the different\r\necclesiastical seasons and festivals, commemorations of saints and\r\nmartyrs and other special offices. Different dioceses and religious\r\nhouses had their own peculiarities of ritual, including such hymns as\r\nwere approved by their several bishops or ecclesiastical superiors,\r\nvarying in detail, but all following the same general method. The\r\nnational rituals, which were first reduced into a form substantially\r\nlike that which has since prevailed, were probably those of Lombardy and\r\nof Spain, now known as the \"Ambrosian\" and the \"Mozarabic.\" The age and\r\norigin of the Spanish ritual are uncertain, but it is mentioned in the\r\n7th century by Isidore, bishop of Seville. It contained a copious\r\nhymnary, the original form of which may be regarded as canonically\r\napproved by the fourth council of Toledo (633). By the 13th canon of\r\nthat council, an opinion (which even then found advocates) against the\r\nuse in churches of any hymns not taken from the Scriptures--apparently\r\nthe same opinion which had been held by Paul of Samosata--was censured;\r\nand it was ordered that such hymns should be used in the Spanish as well\r\nas in the Gallican churches, the penalty of excommunication being\r\ndenounced against all who might presume to reject them.\r\n\r\nThe hymns of which the use was thus established and authorized were\r\nthose which entered into the daily and other offices of the church,\r\nafterwards collected in the \"Breviaries\"; in which the hymns \"proper\"\r\nfor \"the week,\" and for \"the season,\" continued for many centuries, with\r\nvery few exceptions, to be derived from the earliest epoch of Latin\r\nChurch poetry--reckoning that epoch as extending from Hilary and Ambrose\r\nto the end of the pontificate of Gregory the Great. The \"Ambrosian\"\r\nmusic, to which those hymns were generally sung down to the time of\r\nGregory, was more popular and congregational than the \"Gregorian,\" which\r\nthen came into use, and afterwards prevailed. In the service of the mass\r\nit was not the general practice, before the invention of sequences in\r\nthe 9th century, to sing any hymns, except some from the Scriptures\r\nesteemed canonical, such as the \"Song of the Three Children\"\r\n(\"Benedicite omnia opera\"). But to this rule there were, according to\r\nWalafrid Strabo, some occasional exceptions; particularly in the case of\r\nPaulinus, patriarch of Aquileia under Charlemagne, himself a\r\nhymn-writer, who frequently used hymns, composed by himself or others,\r\nin the eucharistic office, especially in private masses.\r\n\r\nSome of the hymns called \"Ambrosian\" (nearly 100 in number) are beyond\r\nall question by Ambrose himself, and the rest probably belong to his\r\ntime or to the following century. Four, those beginning \"Aeterne rerum\r\nconditor\" (\"Dread Framer of the earth and sky\"), \"Deus Creator omnium\"\r\n(\"Maker of all things, glorious God\"), \"Veni Redemptor Gentium\"\r\n(\"Redeemer of the nations, come\") and \"Jam surgit hora tertia\" (\"Christ\r\nat this hour was crucified\"), are quoted as works of Ambrose by\r\nAugustine. These, and others by the hand of the same master, have the\r\nqualities most valuable in hymns intended for congregational use. They\r\nare short and complete in themselves; easy, and at the same time\r\nelevated in their expression and rhythm; terse and masculine in thought\r\nand language; and (though sometimes criticized as deficient in\r\ntheological precision) simple, pure and not technical in their rendering\r\nof the great facts and doctrines of Christianity, which they present in\r\nan objective and not a subjective manner. They have exercised a powerful\r\ninfluence, direct or indirect, upon many of the best works of the same\r\nkind in all succeeding generations. With the Ambrosian hymns are\r\nproperly classed those of Hilary, and the contemporary works of Pope\r\nDamasus I. (who wrote two hymns in commemoration of saints), and of\r\nPrudentius, from whose _Cathemerina_ (\"Daily Devotions\") and\r\n_Peristephana_ (\"Crown-songs for Martyrs\"), all poems of considerable,\r\nsome of great length--about twenty-eight hymns, found in various\r\nBreviaries, were derived. Prudentius was a layman, a native of\r\nSaragossa, and it was in the Spanish ritual that his hymns were most\r\nlargely used. In the Mozarabic Breviary almost the whole of one of his\r\nfinest poems (from which most churches took one part only, beginning\r\n\"Corde natus ex parentis\") was appointed to be sung between Easter and\r\nAscension-Day, being divided into eight or nine hymns; and on some of\r\nthe commemorations of Spanish saints long poems from his _Peristephana_\r\nwere recited or sung at large. He is entitled to a high rank among\r\nChristian poets, many of the hymns taken from his works being full of\r\nfervour and sweetness, and by no means deficient in dignity or strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n  5th and 6th centuries.\r\n\r\nThese writers were followed in the 5th and early in the 6th century by\r\nthe priest Sedulius, whose reputation perhaps exceeded his merit; Elpis,\r\na noble Roman lady (considered, by an erroneous tradition, to have been\r\nthe wife of the philosophic statesman Boetius); Pope Gelasius I.; and\r\nEnnodius, bishop of Pavia. Sedulius and Elpis wrote very little from\r\nwhich hymns could be extracted; but the small number taken from their\r\ncompositions obtained wide popularity, and have since held their ground.\r\nGelasius was of no great account as a hymn-writer; and the works of\r\nEnnodius appear to have been known only in Italy and Spain. The latter\r\npart of the 6th century produced Pope Gregory the Great and Venantius\r\nFortunatus, an Italian poet, the friend of Gregory, and the favourite of\r\nRadegunda, queen of the Franks, who died (609) bishop of Poitiers.\r\nEleven hymns of Gregory, and twelve or thirteen (mostly taken from\r\nlonger poems) by Fortunatus, came into general use in the Italian,\r\nGallican and British churches. Those of Gregory are in a style hardly\r\ndistinguishable from the Ambrosian; those of Fortunatus are graceful,\r\nand sometimes vigorous. He does not, however, deserve the praise given\r\nto him by Dr Neale, of having struck out a new path in Latin hymnody. On\r\nthe contrary, he may more justly be described as a disciple of the\r\nschool of Prudentius, and as having affected the classical style, at\r\nleast as much as any of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n  The poets of this primitive epoch, which closed with the 6th century,\r\n  wrote in the old classical metres, and made use of a considerable\r\n  variety of them--anapaestic, anacreontic, hendecasyllabic, asclepiad,\r\n  hexameters and pentameters and others. Gregory and some of the\r\n  Ambrosian authors occasionally wrote in sapphics; but the most\r\n  frequent measure was the iambic dimeter, and, next to that, the\r\n  trochaic. The full alcaic stanza does not appear to have been used for\r\n  church purposes before the 16th century, though some of its elements\r\n  were. In the greater number of these works, a general intention to\r\n  conform to the rules of Roman prosody is manifest; but even those\r\n  writers (like Prudentius) in whom that conformity was most decided\r\n  allowed themselves much liberty of deviation from it. Other works,\r\n  including some of the very earliest, and some of conspicuous merit,\r\n  were of the kind described by Bede as not metrical but\r\n  \"rhythmical\"--i.e. (as he explains the term \"rhythm\"), \"modulated to\r\n  the ear in imitation of different metres.\" It would be more correct to\r\n  call them metrical--(e.g. still trochaic or iambic, &c., but,\r\n  according to new laws of syllabic quantity, depending entirely on\r\n  accent, and not on the power of vowels or the position of\r\n  consonants)--laws by which the future prosody of all modern European\r\n  nations was to be governed. There are also, in the hymns of the\r\n  primitive period (even in those of Ambrose), anticipations--irregular\r\n  indeed and inconstant, but certainly not accidental--of another great\r\n  innovation, destined to receive important developments, that of\r\n  assonance or rhyme, in the final letters or syllables of verses.\r\n  Archbishop Trench, in the introduction to his _Sacred Latin Poetry_,\r\n  has traced the whole course of the transition from the ancient to the\r\n  modern forms of versification, ascribing it to natural and necessary\r\n  causes, which made such changes needful for the due development of the\r\n  new forms of spiritual and intellectual life, consequent upon the\r\n  conversion of the Latin-speaking nations to Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  6th century downwards.\r\n\r\nFrom the 6th century downwards we see this transformation making\r\ncontinual progress, each nation of Western Christendom adding, from time\r\nto time, to the earlier hymns in its service-books others of more recent\r\nand frequently of local origin. For these additions, the commemorations\r\nof saints, &c., as to which the devotion of one place often differed\r\nfrom that of another, offered especial opportunities. This process,\r\nwhile it promoted the development of a medieval as distinct from the\r\nprimitive style, led also to much deterioration in the quality of\r\nhymns, of which, perhaps, some of the strongest examples may be found in\r\na volume published in 1865 by the Irish Archaeological Society from a\r\nmanuscript in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. It contains a\r\nnumber of hymns by Irish saints of the 6th, 7th and 8th centuries--in\r\nseveral instances fully rhymed, and in one mixing Erse and Latin\r\nbarbarously together, as was not uncommon, at a much later date, in\r\nsemi-vernacular hymns of other countries. The Mozarabic Breviary, and\r\nthe collection of hymns used in the Anglo-Saxon churches, published in\r\n1851 by the Surtees Society (chiefly from a Benedictine MS. In the\r\ncollege library of Durham, supplemented by other MSS. in the British\r\nMuseum), supply many further illustrations of the same decline of\r\ntaste:--such Sapphics, e.g., as the \"Festum insigne prodiit coruscum\" of\r\nIsidore, and the \"O veneranda Trinitas laudanda\" of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nbooks. The early medieval period, however, from the time of Gregory the\r\nGreat to that of Hildebrand, was far from deficient in the production of\r\ngood hymns, wherever learning flourished. Bede in England, and Paul \"the\r\nDeacon\"--the author of a fairly classical sapphic ode on St John the\r\nBaptist--in Italy, were successful followers of the Ambrosian and\r\nGregorian styles. Eleven metrical hymns are attributed to Bede by\r\nCassander; and there are also in one of Bede's works (_Collectanea et\r\nflores_) two rhythmical hymns of considerable length on the Day of\r\nJudgment, with the refrains \"In tremendo die\" and \"Attende homo,\" both\r\nirregularly rhymed, and, in parts, not unworthy of comparison with the\r\n\"Dies Irae.\" Paulinus, patriarch of Aquileia, contemporary with Paul,\r\nwrote rhythmical trimeter iambics in a manner peculiar to himself.\r\nTheodulph, bishop of Orleans (793-835), author of the famous\r\nprocessional hymn for Palm Sunday in hexameters and pentameters,\r\n\"Gloria, laus, et honor tibi sit, Rex Christe Redemptor\" (\"Glory and\r\nhonour and laud be to Thee, King Christ the Redeemer\"), and Hrabanus\r\nMaurus, archbishop of Mainz, the pupil of Alcuin, and the most learned\r\ntheologian of his day, enriched the church with some excellent works.\r\nAmong the anonymous hymns of the same period there are three of great\r\nbeauty, of which the influence may be traced in most, if not all, of the\r\n\"New Jerusalem\" hymns of later generations, including those of Germany\r\nand Great Britain:--\"Urbs beata Hierusalem\" (\"Blessed city, heavenly\r\nSalem\"); \"Alleluia piis edite laudibus\" (\"Alleluias sound ye in strains\r\nof holy praise\"--called, from its burden, \"Alleluia perenne\"); and\r\n\"Alleluia dulce carmen\" (\"Alleluia, song of sweetness\"), which, being\r\nfound in Anglo-Saxon hymnaries certainly older than the Conquest, cannot\r\nbe of the late date assigned to it, in his _Mediaeval Hymns and\r\nSequences_, by Neale. These were followed by the \"Chorus novae\r\nHierusalem\" (\"Ye Choirs of New Jerusalem\") of Fulbert, bishop of\r\nChartres. This group of hymns is remarkable for an attractive union of\r\nmelody, imagination, poetical colouring and faith. It represents,\r\nperhaps, the best and highest type of the middle school, between the\r\nsevere Ambrosian simplicity and the florid luxuriance of later times.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Veni Creator.\r\n\r\n  Notker.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated hymn, which belongs to the first medieval period, is\r\nthe \"Veni Creator Spiritus\" (\"Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire\"). The\r\nearliest recorded occasion of its use is that of a translation (898) of\r\nthe relics of St Marcellus, mentioned in the _Annals_ of the Benedictine\r\norder. It has since been constantly sung throughout Western Christendom\r\n(as versions of it still are in the Church of England), as part of the\r\nappointed offices for the coronation of kings, the consecration and\r\nordination of bishops and priests, the assembling of synods and other\r\ngreat ecclesiastical solemnities. It has been attributed--probably in\r\nconsequence of certain corruptions in the text of Ekkehard's _Life of\r\nNotker_ (a work of the 13th century)--to Charlemagne. Ekkehard wrote in\r\nthe Benedictine monastery of St Gall, to which Notker belonged, with\r\nfull access to its records; and an ignorant interpolator, regardless of\r\nchronology, added, at some later date, the word \"Great\" to the name of\r\n\"the emperor Charles,\" wherever it was mentioned in that work. The\r\nbiographer relates that Notker--a man of a gentle, contemplative nature,\r\nobservant of all around him, and accustomed to find spiritual and\r\npoetical suggestions in common sights and sounds--was moved by the\r\nsound of a mill-wheel to compose his \"sequence\" on the Holy Spirit,\r\n\"Sancti Spiritus adsit nobis gratia\" (\"Present with us ever be the Holy\r\nSpirit's grace\"); and that, when finished, he sent it as a present to\r\n\"the emperor Charles,\" who in return sent him back, \"by the same\r\nmessenger,\" the hymn \"Veni Creator,\" which (says Ekkehard) the same\r\n\"Spirit had inspired him to write\" (\"Sibi idem Spiritus inspiraverat\").\r\nIf this story is to be credited--and, from its circumstantial and almost\r\ndramatic character, it has an air of truth--the author of \"Veni Creator\"\r\nwas not Charlemagne, but his grandson the emperor Charles the Bald.\r\nNotker himself long survived that emperor, and died in 912.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sequences.\r\n\r\nThe invention of \"sequences\" by Notker may be regarded as the beginning\r\nof the later medieval epoch of Latin hymnody. In the eucharistic\r\nservice, in which (as has been stated) hymns were not generally used, it\r\nhad been the practice, except at certain seasons, to sing \"laud,\" or\r\n\"Alleluia,\" between the epistle and the gospel, and to fill up what\r\nwould otherwise have been a long pause, by extending the cadence upon\r\nthe two final vowels of the \"Alleluia\" into a protracted strain of\r\nmusic. It occurred to Notker that, while preserving the spirit of that\r\npart of the service, the monotony of the interval might be relieved by\r\nintroducing at that point a chant of praise specially composed for the\r\npurpose. With that view he produced the peculiar species of rhythmical\r\ncomposition which obtained the name of \"sequentia\" (probably from\r\nfollowing after the close of the \"Alleluia\"), and also that of \"prosa,\"\r\nbecause its structure was originally irregular and unmetrical,\r\nresembling in this respect the Greek \"troparia,\" and the \"Te Deum,\"\r\n\"Benedicite\" and canticles. That it was in some measure suggested by the\r\nforms of the later Greek hymnody seems probable, both from the\r\nintercourse (at that time frequent) between the Eastern and Western\r\nchurches, and from the application by Ekkehard, in his biography and\r\nelsewhere (e.g. in Lyndwood's _Provinciale_), of some technical terms,\r\nborrowed from the Greek terminology, to works of Notker and his school\r\nand to books containing them.\r\n\r\n  Dr Neale, in a learned dissertation prefixed to his collection of\r\n  sequences from medieval Missals, and enlarged in a Latin letter to H.\r\n  A. Daniel (printed in the fifth volume of Daniel's _Thesaurus\r\n  hymnologicus_), investigated the laws of caesura and modulation which\r\n  are discoverable in these works. Those first brought into use were\r\n  sent by their author to Pope Nicholas I., who authorized their use,\r\n  and that of others composed after the same model by other brethren of\r\n  St Gall, in all churches of the West.\r\n\r\n  Although the sequences of Notker and his school, which then rapidly\r\n  passed into most German, French and British Missals, were not\r\n  metrical, the art of \"assonance\" was much practised in them. Many of\r\n  those in the Sarum and French Missals have every verse, and even every\r\n  clause or division of a verse, ending with the same vowel \"a\"--perhaps\r\n  with some reference to the terminal letter of \"Alleluia.\" Artifices\r\n  such as these naturally led the way to the adaptation of the same kind\r\n  of composition to regular metre and fully developed rhyme. Neale's\r\n  full and large collection, and the second volume of Daniel's\r\n  _Thesaurus_, contain numerous examples, both of the \"proses,\" properly\r\n  so called, of the Notkerian type, and of those of the later school,\r\n  which (from the religious house to which its chief writer belonged)\r\n  has been called \"Victorine.\" Most Missals appear to have contained\r\n  some of both kinds. In the majority of those from which Neale's\r\n  specimens are taken, the metrical kind largely prevailed; but in some\r\n  (e.g. those of Sarum and Liége) the greater number were Notkerian.\r\n\r\nOf the sequence on the Holy Ghost, sent by Notker (according to\r\nEkkehard) to Charles the Bald, Neale says that it \"was in use all over\r\nEurope, even in those countries, like Italy and Spain, which usually\r\nrejected sequences\"; and that, \"in the Missal of Palencia, the priest\r\nwas ordered to hold a white dove in his hands, while intoning the first\r\nsyllables, and then to let it go.\" Another of the most remarkable of\r\nNotker's sequences, beginning \"Media in vita\" (\"In the midst of life we\r\nare in death\"), is said to have been suggested to him while observing\r\nsome workmen engaged in the construction of a bridge over a torrent near\r\nhis monastery. Catherine Winkworth (_Christian Singers of Germany_,\r\n1869) states that this was long used as a battle-song, until the custom\r\nwas forbidden, on account of its being supposed to exercise a magical\r\ninfluence. A translation of it (\"Mitten wir im Leben sind\") is one of\r\nLuther's funeral hymns; and all but the opening sentence of that part of\r\nthe burial service of the Church of England which is directed to be\r\n\"said or sung\" at the grave, \"while the corpse is made ready to be laid\r\ninto the earth,\" is taken from it.\r\n\r\nThe \"Golden Sequence,\" \"Veni, sancte Spiritus\" (\"Holy Spirit, Lord of\r\nLight\"), is an early example of the transition of sequences from a\r\nsimply rhythmical to a metrical form. Archbishop Trench, who esteemed it\r\n\"the loveliest of all the hymns in the whole circle of Latin sacred\r\npoetry,\" inclined to give credit to a tradition which ascribes its\r\nauthorship to Robert II., king of France, son of Hugh Capet. Others have\r\nassigned to it a later date--some attributing it to Pope Innocent III.,\r\nand some to Stephen Langton, archbishop of Canterbury. Many\r\ntranslations, in German, English and other languages, attest its merit.\r\nBerengarius of Tours, St Bernard of Clairvaux and Abelard, in the 11th\r\ncentury and early in the 12th, followed in the same track; and the art\r\nof the Victorine school was carried to its greatest perfection by Adam\r\nof St Victor (who died between 1173 and 1194)--\"the most fertile, and\"\r\n(in the concurrent judgment of Archbishop Trench and Neale) \"the\r\ngreatest of the Latin hymnographers of the Middle Ages.\" The\r\narchbishop's selection contains many excellent specimens of his works.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dies Irae.\r\n\r\n  Stabat Mater.\r\n\r\n  Aquinas.\r\n\r\nBut the two most widely celebrated of all this class of\r\ncompositions--works which have exercised the talents of the greatest\r\nmusical composers, and of innumerable translators in almost all\r\nlanguages--are the \"Dies Irae\" (\"That day of wrath, that dreadful day\"),\r\nby Thomas of Celano, the companion and biographer of St Francis of\r\nAssisi, and the \"Stabat Mater dolorosa\" (\"By the cross sad vigil\r\nkeeping\") of Jacopone, or Jacobus de Benedictis, a Franciscan humorist\r\nand reformer, who was persecuted by Pope Boniface VIII. for his satires\r\non the prelacy of the time, and died in 1306. Besides these, the 13th\r\ncentury produced the famous sequence \"Lauda Sion salvatorem\" (\"Sion,\r\nlift thy voice and sing\"), and the four other well-known sacramental\r\nhymns of St Thomas Aquinas, viz. \"Pange lingua gloriosi corporis\r\nmysterium\" (\"Sing, my tongue, the Saviour's glory\"), \"Verbum supernum\r\nprodiens\" (\"The Word, descending from above\"--not to be confounded with\r\nthe Ambrosian hymn from which it borrowed the first line), \"Sacris\r\nsolemniis juncta sint gaudia\" (\"Let us with hearts renewed our grateful\r\nhomage pay\"), and \"Adoro Te devote, latens Deitas\" (\"O Godhead hid,\r\ndevoutly I adore Thee\")--a group of remarkable compositions, written by\r\nhim for the then new festival of Corpus Christi, of which he induced\r\nPope Urban IV. (1261-1265) to decree the observance. In these (of which\r\nall but \"Adoro Te devote\" passed rapidly into breviaries and missals)\r\nthe doctrine of transubstantiation is set forth with a wonderful degree\r\nof scholastic precision; and they exercised, probably, a not unimportant\r\ninfluence upon the general reception of that dogma. They are undoubtedly\r\nworks of genius, powerful in thought, feeling and expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Medieval hymns.\r\n\r\nThese and other medieval hymn-writers of the 12th and 13th centuries may\r\nbe described, generally, as poet-schoolmen. Their tone is contemplative,\r\ndidactic, theological; they are especially fertile and ingenious in the\r\nfield of mystical interpretation. Two great monasteries in the East had,\r\nin the 8th and 9th centuries, been the principal centres of Greek\r\nhymnology; and, in the West, three monasteries--St Gall, near Constance\r\n(which was long the especial seat of German religious literature), Cluny\r\nin Burgundy and St Victor, near Paris--obtained a similar distinction.\r\nSt Gall produced, besides Notker, several distinguished sequence\r\nwriters, probably his pupils--Hartmann, Hermann and Gottschalk--to the\r\nlast of whom Neale ascribes the \"Alleluiatic Sequence\" (\"Cantemus cuncti\r\nmelodum nunc Alleluia\"), well known in England through his translation,\r\n\"The strain upraise of joy and praise.\" The chief poets of Cluny were\r\ntwo of its abbots, Odo and Peter the Venerable (1122-1156), and one of\r\nPeter's monks, Bernard of Morlaix, who wrote the remarkable poem on\r\n\"Contempt of the World\" in about 3000 long rolling \"leonine-dactylic\"\r\nverses, from parts of which Neale's popular hymns, \"Jerusalem the\r\ngolden,\" &c., are taken. The abbey of St Victor, besides Adam and his\r\nfollower Pistor, was destined afterwards to produce the most popular\r\nchurch poet of the 17th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bernard of Clairvaux.\r\n\r\nThere were other distinguished Latin hymn-writers of the later medieval\r\nperiod besides those already mentioned. The name of St Bernard of\r\nClairvaux cannot be passed over with the mere mention of the fact that\r\nhe was the author of some metrical sequences. He was, in truth, the\r\nfather, in Latin hymnody, of that warm and passionate form of devotion\r\nwhich some may consider to apply too freely to Divine Objects the\r\nlanguage of human affection, but which has, nevertheless, been popular\r\nwith many devout persons, in Protestant as well as Roman Catholic\r\nchurches. F. von Spee, \"Angelus Silesius,\" Madame Guyon, Bishop Ken,\r\nCount Zinzendorf and Frederick William Faber may be regarded as\r\ndisciples in this school. Many hymns, in various languages, have been\r\nfounded upon St Bernard's \"Jesu dulcis memoria\" (\"Jesu, the very thought\r\nof Thee\"), \"Jesu dulcedo cordium\" (\"Jesu, Thou joy of loving hearts\")\r\nand \"Jesu Rex admirabilis\" (\"O Jesu, King most wonderful\")--three\r\nportions of one poem, nearly 200 lines long. Pietro Damiani, the friend\r\nof Pope Gregory VII, Marbode, bishop of Rennes, in the 11th, Hildebert,\r\narchbishop of Tours, in the 12th, and St Bonaventura in the 13th\r\ncenturies, are other eminent men who added poetical fame as\r\nhymnographers to high public distinction.\r\n\r\nBefore the time of the Reformation, the multiplication of sequences\r\n(often as unedifying in matter as unpoetical in style) had done much to\r\ndegrade the common conception of hymnody. In some parts of France,\r\nPortugal, Sardinia and Bohemia, their use in the vernacular language had\r\nbeen allowed. In Germany also there were vernacular sequences as early\r\nas the 12th century, specimens of which may be seen in the third chapter\r\nof C. Winkworth's _Christian Singers of Germany_. Scoffing parodies upon\r\nsequences are said to have been among the means used in Scotland to\r\ndiscredit the old church services. After the 15th century they were\r\ndiscouraged at Rome. They retained for a time some of their old\r\npopularity among German Protestants, and were only gradually\r\nrelinquished in France. A new \"prose,\" in honour of St Maxentia, is\r\namong the compositions of Jean Baptiste Santeul; and Dr Daniel's second\r\nvolume closes with one written in 1855 upon the dogma of the Immaculate\r\nConception.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Roman revision of hymns.\r\n\r\n  The taste of the Renaissance was offended by all deviations from\r\n  classical prosody and Latinity. Pope Leo X. directed the whole body of\r\n  the hymns in use at Rome to be reformed; and the _Hymni novi\r\n  ecclesiastici juxta veram metri et Latinitatis normam_, prepared by\r\n  Zacharie Ferreri (1479-1530), a Benedictine of Monte Cassino,\r\n  afterwards a Carthusian and bishop of Guardia, to whom Leo had\r\n  committed that task, appeared at Rome in 1525, with the sanction of a\r\n  later pope, Clement VII. The next step was to revise the whole Roman\r\n  Breviary. That undertaking, after passing through several stages under\r\n  different popes (particularly Pius V. and Clement VIII.), was at last\r\n  brought to a conclusion by Urban VIII., in 1631. From this revised\r\n  Breviary a large number of medieval hymns, both of the earlier and the\r\n  later periods, were excluded; and in their places many new hymns,\r\n  including some by Pope Urban himself, and some by Cardinal Bellarmine\r\n  and another cardinal (Silvius Antonianus) were introduced. The hymns\r\n  of the primitive epoch, from Hilary to Gregory the Great, for the most\r\n  part retained their places (especially in the offices for every day of\r\n  the week); and there remained altogether from seventy to eighty of\r\n  earlier date than the 11th century. Those, however, which were so\r\n  retained were freely altered, and by no means generally improved. The\r\n  revisers appointed by Pope Urban (three learned Jesuits--Strada,\r\n  Gallucci and Petrucci) professed to have made \"as few changes as\r\n  possible\" in the works of Ambrose, Gregory, Prudentius, Sedulius,\r\n  Fortunatus and other \"poets of great name.\" But some changes, even in\r\n  those works, were made with considerable boldness; and the pope, in\r\n  the \"constitution\" by which his new book was promulgated, boasted\r\n  that, \"with the exception of a very small number ('perpaucis'), which\r\n  were either prose or merely rhythmical, all the hymns had been made\r\n  conformable to the laws of prosody and Latinity, those which could not\r\n  be corrected by any milder method being entirely rewritten.\" The\r\n  latter fate befel, among others, the beautiful \"Urbs beata\r\n  Hierusalem,\" which now assumed the form (to many, perhaps, better\r\n  known), of \"Caelestis urbs Jerusalem.\" Of the \"very few\" which were\r\n  spared, the chief were \"Ave maris stella\" (\"Gentle star of ocean\"),\r\n  \"Dies Irae,\" \"Stabat Mater dolorosa,\" the hymns of Thomas Aquinas,\r\n  two of St Bernard and one Ambrosian hymn, \"Jesu nostra Redemptio\" (\"O\r\n  Jesu, our Redemption\"), which approaches nearer than others to the\r\n  tone of St Bernard. A then recent hymn of St Francis Xavier, with\r\n  scarcely enough merit of any kind to atone for its neglect of prosody,\r\n  \"O Deus, ego amo Te\" (\"O God, I love Thee, not because\"), was at the\r\n  same time introduced without change. This hymnary of Pope Urban VIII.\r\n  is now in general use throughout the Roman Communion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Parisian revisions.\r\n\r\n  The Parisian hymnary underwent three revisions--the first in 1527,\r\n  when a new \"Psaltery with hymns\" was issued. In this such changes only\r\n  were made as the revisers thought justifiable upon the principle of\r\n  correcting supposed corruptions of the original text. Of these, the\r\n  transposition, \"Urbs Jerusalem beata,\" instead of \"Urbs beata\r\n  Hierusalem,\" may be taken as a typical example. The next revision was\r\n  in 1670-1680, under Cardinal Péréfixe, preceptor of Louis XIV., and\r\n  Francis Harlay, successively archbishops of Paris, who employed for\r\n  this purpose Claude Santeul, of the monastery of St Magloire, and,\r\n  through him, obtained the assistance of other French scholars,\r\n  including his more celebrated brother, Jean Baptiste Santeul, of the\r\n  abbey of St Victor--better known as \"Santolius Victorinus.\" The third\r\n  and final revision was completed in 1735, under the primacy of\r\n  Cardinal Archbishop de Vintimille, who engaged for it the services of\r\n  Charles Coffin, then rector of the university of Paris. Many old hymns\r\n  were omitted in Archbishop Harlay's Breviary, and a large number of\r\n  new compositions, by the Santeuls and others, was introduced. It\r\n  still, however, retained in their old places (without further changes\r\n  than had been made in 1527) about seventy of earlier date than the\r\n  11th century--including thirty-one Ambrosian, one by Hilary, eight by\r\n  Prudentius, seven by Fortunatus, three by Paul the Deacon, two each by\r\n  Sedulius, Elpis, Gregory and Hrabanus Maurus, \"Veni Creator\" and \"Urbs\r\n  Jerusalem beata.\" Most of these disappeared in 1735, although Cardinal\r\n  Vintimille, in his preface, professed to have still admitted the old\r\n  hymns, except when the new were better--(\"veteribus hymnis locus datus\r\n  est, nisi quibus, ob sententiarum vim, elegantiam verborum, et\r\n  teneriores pietatis sensus, recentiores anteponi satius visum est\").\r\n  The number of the new was, at the same time, very largely increased.\r\n  Only twenty-one more ancient than the 16th century remained, of which\r\n  those belonging to the primitive epoch were but eight, viz. four\r\n  Ambrosian, two by Fortunatus and one each by Prudentius and Gregory.\r\n  The number of Jean Baptiste Santeul's hymns rose to eighty-nine; those\r\n  by Coffin--including some old hymns, e.g. \"Jam lucis orto sidere\"\r\n  (\"Once more the sun is beaming bright\"), which he substantially\r\n  re-wrote--were eighty-three; those of other modern French writers,\r\n  ninety-seven. Whatever opinion may be entertained of the principles on\r\n  which these Roman and Parisian revisions proceeded, it would be unjust\r\n  to deny very high praise as hymn-writers to several of their poets,\r\n  especially to Coffin and Jean Baptiste Santeul. The noble hymn by\r\n  Coffin, beginning--\r\n\r\n    \"O luce qui mortalibus        \"O Thou who in the light dost dwell,\r\n     Lates inaccessa, Deus,        To mortals unapproachable,\r\n     Praesente quo sancti tremunt  Where angels veil them from Thy rays,\r\n     Nubuntque vultus angeli,\"     And tremble as they gaze,\"\r\n\r\n  and several others of his works, breathe the true Ambrosian spirit;\r\n  and though Santeul (generally esteemed the better poet of the two)\r\n  delighted in alcaics, and did not greatly affect the primitive manner,\r\n  there can be no question as to the excellence of such hymns as his\r\n  \"Fumant Sabaeis templa vaporibus\" (\"Sweet incense breathes around\"),\r\n  \"Stupete gentes, fit Deus hostia\" (\"Tremble, ye Gentile lands\"),\r\n  \"Hymnis dum resonat curia caelitum\" (\"Ye in the house of heavenly\r\n  morn\"), and \"Templi sacratas pande, Sion, fores\" (\"O Sion, open wide\r\n  thy gates\"). It is a striking testimony to the merits of those writers\r\n  that such accomplished translators as the Rev. Isaac Williams and the\r\n  Rev. John Chandler appear (from the title-page of the latter, and the\r\n  prefaces of both) to have supposed their hymns to be \"ancient\" and\r\n  \"primitive.\" Among the other authors associated with them, perhaps the\r\n  first place is due to the Abbé Besnault, of Sens, who contributed to\r\n  the book of 1735 the \"Urbs beata vera pacis Visio Jerusalem,\" in the\r\n  opinion of Neale \"much superior\" to the \"Caelestis urbs Jerusalem\" of\r\n  the Roman Breviary. This stood side by side with the \"Urbs Jerusalem\r\n  beata\" of 1527 (in the office for the dedication of churches) till\r\n  1822, when the older form was at last finally excluded by Archbishop\r\n  de Quelen.\r\n\r\n  The Parisian Breviary of 1735 remained in use till the national French\r\n  service-books were superseded (as they have lately been, generally, if\r\n  not universally) by the Roman. Almost all French dioceses followed,\r\n  not indeed the Breviary, but the example, of Paris; and before the end\r\n  of the 18th century the ancient Latin hymnody was all but banished\r\n  from France.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Modern Latin hymns.\r\n\r\n  In some parts of Germany, after the Reformation, Latin hymns continued\r\n  to be used even by Protestants. This was the case at Halberstadt until\r\n  quite a recent date. In England, a few are still occasionally used in\r\n  the older universities and colleges. Some, also, have been composed in\r\n  both countries since the Reformation. The \"Carmina lyrica\" of Johann\r\n  Jakob Balde, a native of Alsace, and a Jesuit priest in Bavaria, have\r\n  received high commendation from very eminent German critics,\r\n  particularly Herder and Augustus Schlegel. Some of the Latin hymns of\r\n  William Alard (1572-1645), a Protestant refugee from Belgium, and\r\n  pastor in Holstein, have been thought worthy of a place in Archbishop\r\n  Trench's selection. Two by W. Petersen (printed at the end of\r\n  Haberkorn's supplement to Jacobi's _Psalmodia Germanica_) are good in\r\n  different ways--one, \"Jesu dulcis amor meus\" (\"Jesus, Thee my soul\r\n  doth love\"), being a gentle melody of spiritual devotion, and the\r\n  other, entitled _Spes Sionis_, violently controversial against Rome.\r\n  An English hymn of the 17th century, in the Ambrosian style, \"Te Deum\r\n  Patrem colimus\" (\"Almighty Father, just and good\"), is sung on every\r\n  May-Day morning by the choristers of Magdalen College, Oxford, from\r\n  the top of the tower of their chapel; and another in the style of the\r\n  Renaissance, of about the same date, \"Te de profundis, summe Rex\"\r\n  (\"Thee from the depths, Almighty King\"), long formed part of a grace\r\n  formerly sung by the scholars of Winchester College.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Luther.\r\n\r\n5. _German Hymnody._--Luther was a proficient in and a lover of music.\r\nHe desired (as he says in the preface to his hymn-book of 1545) that\r\nthis \"beautiful ornament\" might \"in a right manner serve the great\r\nCreator and His Christian people.\" The persecuted Bohemian or Hussite\r\nChurch, then settled on the borders of Moravia under the name of \"United\r\nBrethren,\" had sent to him, on a mission in 1522, Michael Weiss, who not\r\nlong afterwards published a number of German translations from old\r\nBohemian hymns (known as those of the \"Bohemian Brethren\"), with some of\r\nhis own. These Luther highly approved and recommended. He himself, in\r\n1522, published a small volume of eight hymns, which was enlarged to 63\r\nin 1527, and to 125 in 1545. He had formed what he called a \"house\r\nchoir\" of musical friends, to select such old and popular tunes (whether\r\nsecular or ecclesiastical) as might be found suitable, and to compose\r\nnew melodies, for church use. His fellow labourers in this field\r\n(besides Weiss) were Justus Jonas, his own especial colleague; Paul\r\nEber, the disciple and friend of Melanchthon; John Walther, choirmaster\r\nsuccessively to several German princes, and professor of arts, &c., at\r\nWittenberg; Nicholas Decius, who from a monk became a Protestant teacher\r\nin Brunswick, and translated the \"Gloria in Excelsis,\" &c.; and Paul\r\nSperatus, chaplain to Duke Albert of Prussia in 1525. Some of their\r\nworks are still popular in Germany. Weiss's \"Funeral Hymn,\" \"Nun lasst\r\nuns den Leib begraben\" (\"Now lay we calmly in the grave\"); Eber's \"Herr\r\nJesu Christ, wahr Mensch und Gott\" (\"Lord Jesus Christ, true Man and\r\nGod\"), and \"Wenn wir in höchsten Nöthen sein\" (\"When in the hour of\r\nutmost need\"); Walther's \"New Heavens and new Earth\" (\"Now fain my\r\njoyous heart would sing\"); Decius's \"To God on high be thanks and\r\npraise\"; and Speratus's \"Salvation now has come for all,\" are among\r\nthose which at the time produced the greatest effect, and are still best\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nLuther's own hymns, thirty-seven in number (of which about twelve are\r\ntranslations or adaptations from Latin originals), are for the principal\r\nChristian seasons; on the sacraments, the church, grace, death, &c.; and\r\nparaphrases of seven psalms, of a passage in Isaiah, and of the Lord's\r\nPrayer, Ten Commandments, Creed, Litany and \"Te Deum.\" There is also a\r\nvery touching and stirring song on the martyrdom of two youths by fire\r\nat Brussels, in 1523-1524. Homely and sometimes rugged in form, and for\r\nthe most part objective in tone, they are full of fire, manly simplicity\r\nand strong faith. Three rise above the rest. One for Christmas, \"Vom\r\nHimmel hoch da komm ich her\" (\"From Heaven above to earth I come\"), has\r\na reverent tenderness, the influence of which may be traced in many\r\nlater productions on the same subject. That on salvation through Christ,\r\nof a didactic character, \"Nun freuet euch, lieben Christen g'mein\"\r\n(\"Dear Christian people, now rejoice\"), is said to have made many\r\nconversions, and to have been once taken up by a large congregation to\r\nsilence a Roman Catholic preacher in the cathedral of Frankfort.\r\nPre-eminent above all is the celebrated paraphrase of the 46th Psalm:\r\n\"Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott\" (\"A sure stronghold our God is\r\nHe\")--\"the production\" (as Ranke says) \"of the moment in which Luther,\r\nengaged in a conflict with a world of foes, sought strength in the\r\nconsciousness that he was defending a divine cause which could never\r\nperish.\" Carlyle compares it to \"a sound of Alpine avalanches, or the\r\nfirst murmur of earthquakes.\" Heine called it \"the Marseillaise of the\r\nReformation.\"\r\n\r\nLuther spent several years in teaching his people at Wittenberg to sing\r\nthese hymns, which soon spread over Germany. Without adopting the\r\nhyperbolical saying of Coleridge, that \"Luther did as much for the\r\nReformation by his hymns as by his translation of the Bible,\" it may\r\ntruly be affirmed, that, among the secondary means by which the success\r\nof the Reformation was promoted, none was more powerful. They were sung\r\neverywhere--in the streets and fields as well as the churches, in the\r\nworkshop and the palace, \"by children in the cottage and by martyrs on\r\nthe scaffold.\" It was by them that a congregational character was given\r\nto the new Protestant worship. This success they owed partly to their\r\nmetrical structure, which, though sometimes complex, was recommended to\r\nthe people by its ease and variety; and partly to the tunes and melodies\r\n(many of them already well known and popular) to which they were set.\r\nThey were used as direct instruments of teaching, and were therefore, in\r\na large measure, didactic and theological; and it may be partly owing to\r\nthis cause that German hymnody came to deviate, so soon and so generally\r\nas it did, from the simple idea expressed in the ancient Augustinian\r\ndefinition, and to comprehend large classes of compositions which, in\r\nmost other countries, would be thought hardly suitable for church use.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Followers of Luther\r\n\r\nThe principal hymn-writers of the Lutheran school, in the latter part of\r\nthe 16th century, were Nikolaus Selnecker, Herman and Hans Sachs, the\r\nshoemaker of Nuremberg, also known in other branches of literature. All\r\nthese wrote some good hymns. They were succeeded by men of another sort,\r\nto whom F. A. Cunz gives the name of \"master-singers,\" as having raised\r\nboth the poetical and the musical standard of German\r\nhymnody:--Bartholomäus Ringwaldt, Ludwig Helmbold, Johannes Pappus, Martin\r\nSchalling, Rutilius and Sigismund Weingartner. The principal topics of\r\ntheir hymns (as if with some foretaste of the calamities which were soon\r\nto follow) were the vanity of earthly things, resignation to the Divine\r\nwill, and preparation for death and judgment. The well-known English hymn,\r\n\"Great God, what do I see and hear,\" is founded upon one by Ringwaldt. Of\r\na quite different character were two of great beauty and universal\r\npopularity, composed by Philip Nicolai, a Westphalian pastor, during a\r\npestilence in 1597, and published by him, with fine chorales, two years\r\nafterwards. One of these (the \"Sleepers wake! a voice is calling,\" of\r\nMendelssohn's oratorio, _St Paul_) belongs to the family of Advent or New\r\nJerusalem hymns. The other, a \"Song of the believing soul concerning the\r\nHeavenly Bridegroom\" (\"Wie schön leucht't uns der Morgenstern\"--\"O morning\r\nStar, how fair and bright\"), became the favourite marriage hymn of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Period of Thirty Years' War.\r\n\r\nThe hymns produced during the Thirty Years' War are characteristic of\r\nthat unhappy time, which (as Miss Winkworth says) \"caused religious men\r\nto look away from this world,\" and made their songs more and more\r\nexpressive of personal feelings. In point of refinement and graces of\r\nstyle, the hymn-writers of this period excelled their predecessors.\r\nTheir taste was chiefly formed by the influence of Martin Opitz, the\r\nfounder of what has been called the \"first Silesian school\" of German\r\npoetry, who died comparatively young in 1639, and who, though not of any\r\ngreat original genius, exercised much power as a critic. Some of the\r\nbest of these works were by men who wrote little. In the famous\r\nbattle-song of Gustavus Adolphus, published (1631) after the victory of\r\nBreitenfeld, for the use of his army, \"Verzage nicht du Häuflein klein\"\r\n(\"Fear not, O little flock, the foe\"), we have almost certainly a\r\ncomposition of the hero-king himself, the versification corrected by his\r\nchaplain Jakob Fabricius (1593-1654) and the music composed by Michael\r\nAltenburg, whose name has been given to the hymn. This, with Luther's\r\nparaphrase of the 67th Psalm, was sung by Gustavus and his soldiers\r\nbefore the battle of Lützen in 1632. Two very fine hymns, one of prayer\r\nfor deliverance and peace, the other of trust in God under calamities,\r\nwere written about the same time by Matthäus Löwenstern, a saddler's\r\nson, poet, musician and statesman, who was ennobled after the peace by\r\nthe emperor Ferdinand III. Martin Rinckhart, in 1636, wrote the \"Chorus\r\nof God's faithful children\" (\"Nun danket alle Gott\"--\"Now thank we all\r\nour God\"), introduced by Mendelssohn in his \"Lobgesang,\" which has been\r\ncalled the \"Te Deum\" of Germany, being usually sung on occasions of\r\npublic thanksgiving. Weissel, in 1635, composed a beautiful Advent hymn\r\n(\"Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates\"), and J. M. Meyfart, professor of\r\ntheology at Erfurt, in 1642, a fine adaptation of the ancient \"Urbs\r\nbeata Hierusalem.\" The hymn of trust in Providence by George Neumark,\r\nlibrarian to that duke of Weimar (\"Wer nur den lieben Gott lässt\r\nwalten\"--\"Leave God to order all thy ways\"), is scarcely, if at all,\r\ninferior to that of Paul Gerhardt on the same theme. Paul Flemming, a\r\ngreat traveller and lover of nature, who died in 1639, also wrote\r\nexcellent compositions, coloured by the same tone of feeling; and some,\r\nof great merit, were composed, soon after the close of the war, by\r\nLouisa Henrietta, electress of Brandenburg, granddaughter of the famous\r\nadmiral Coligny, and mother of the first king of Prussia. With these may\r\nbe classed (though of later date) a few striking hymns of faith and\r\nprayer under mental anxiety, by Anton Ulrich, duke of Brunswick.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rist.\r\n\r\n  Dach.\r\n\r\nThe most copious, and in their day most esteemed, hymn-writers of the\r\nfirst half of the 17th century, were Johann Heermann and Johann Rist.\r\nHeermann, a pastor in Silesia, the theatre (in a peculiar degree) of war\r\nand persecution, experienced in his own person a very large share of the\r\nmiseries of the time, and several times narrowly escaped a violent\r\ndeath. His _Devoti musica cordis_, published in 1630, reflects the\r\nfeelings natural under such circumstances. With a correct style and good\r\nversification, his tone is subjective, and the burden of his hymns is\r\nnot praise, but prayer. Among his works (which enter largely into most\r\nGerman hymn-books), two of the best are the \"Song of Tears\" and the\r\n\"Song of Comfort,\" translated by Miss Winkworth in her _Christian\r\nSingers of Germany_. Rist published about 600 hymns, \"pressed out of\r\nhim,\" as he said, \"by the cross.\" He was a pastor, and son of a pastor,\r\nin Holstein, and lived after the peace to enjoy many years of\r\nprosperity, being appointed poet-laureate to the emperor and finally\r\nennobled. The bulk of his hymns, like those of other copious writers,\r\nare of inferior quality; but some, particularly those for Advent,\r\nEpiphany, Easter Eve and on Angels, are very good. They are more\r\nobjective than those of Heermann, and written, upon the whole, in a more\r\nmanly spirit. Next to Heermann and Rist in fertility of production, and\r\nabove them in poetical genius, was Simon Dach, professor of poetry at\r\nKönigsberg, who died in 1659. Miss Winkworth ranks him high among German\r\npoets, \"for the sweetness of form and depth of tender contemplative\r\nemotion to be found in his verses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Gerhardt.\r\n\r\n  Franck.\r\n\r\n  Scheffler.\r\n\r\nThe fame of all these writers was eclipsed in the latter part of the\r\nsame century by three of the greatest hymnographers whom Germany has\r\nproduced--Paul Gerhardt (1604-1676), Johann Franck (1618-1677) and\r\nJohann Scheffler (1624-1677), the founder of the \"second Silesian\r\nschool,\" who assumed the name of \"Angelus Silesius.\" Gerhardt is by\r\nuniversal consent the prince of Lutheran poets. His compositions, which\r\nmay be compared, in many respects, to those of the _Christian Year_, are\r\nlyric poems, of considerable length, rather than hymns, though many\r\nhymns have been taken from them. They are, with few exceptions,\r\nsubjective, and speak the language of individual experience. They occupy\r\na middle ground between the masculine simplicity of the old Lutheran\r\nstyle and the highly wrought religious emotion of the later pietists,\r\ntowards whom they on the whole incline. Being nearly all excellent, it\r\nis not easy to distinguish among the 123 those which are entitled to the\r\nhighest praise. Two, which were written one during the war and the other\r\nafter the conclusion of peace, \"Zeuch ein zu deinen Thoren\" (\"Come to\r\nThy temple here on earth\"), and \"Gottlob, nun ist erschollen\" (\"Thank\r\nGod, it hath resounded\"), are historically interesting. Of the rest, one\r\nis well known and highly appreciated in English through Wesley's\r\ntranslation, \"Commit thou all thy ways\"; and the evening and\r\nspring-tide hymns (\"Now all the woods are sleeping\" and \"Go forth, my\r\nheart, and seek delight\") show an exquisite feeling for nature; while\r\nnothing can be more tender and pathetic than \"Du bist zwar mein und\r\nbleibest mein\" (\"Thou'rt mine, yes, still thou art mine own\"), on the\r\ndeath of his son. Franck, who was burgomaster of Guben in Lusatia, has\r\nbeen considered by some second only to Gerhardt. If so, it is with a\r\ngreat distance between them. His approach to the later pietists is\r\ncloser than that of Gerhardt. His hymns were published, under the title\r\nof _Geistliche und weltliche Gedichte_, in 1674, some of them being\r\nfounded on Ambrosian and other Latin originals. Miss Winkworth gives\r\nthem the praise of a condensed and polished style and fervid and\r\nimpassioned thought. It was after his conversion to Roman Catholicism\r\nthat Scheffler adopted the name of \"Angelus Silesius,\" and published in\r\n1657 his hymns, under a fantastic title, and with a still more fantastic\r\npreface. Their keynote is divine love; they are enthusiastic, intense,\r\nexuberant in their sweetness, like those of St Bernard among medieval\r\npoets. An adaptation of one of them, by Wesley, \"Thee will I love, my\r\nStrength, my Tower,\" is familiar to English readers. Those for the first\r\nSunday after Epiphany, for Sexagesima Sunday and for Trinity Sunday, in\r\n_Lyra Germanica_, are good examples of his excellences, with few of his\r\ndefects. His hymns are generally so free from the expression, or even\r\nthe indirect suggestion, of Roman Catholic doctrine, that it has been\r\nsupposed they were written before his conversion, though published\r\nafterwards. The evangelical churches of Germany found no difficulty in\r\nadmitting them to that prominent place in their services which they have\r\never since retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pietists.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 17th century, a new religious school arose, to\r\nwhich the name of \"Pietists\" was given, and of which Philipp Jakob\r\nSpener was esteemed the founder. He and his pupils and successors,\r\nAugust Hermann Francke and Anastasius Freylinghausen, all wrote hymns.\r\nSpener's hymns are not remarkable, and Francke's are not numerous.\r\nFreylinghausen was their chief singer; his rhythm is lively, his music\r\nflorid; but, though his book attained extraordinary popularity, he was\r\nsurpassed in solid merit by other less fertile writers of the same\r\nschool. The \"Auf hinauf zu deiner Freude\" (\"Up, yes, upward to thy\r\ngladness\") of Schade may recall to an English reader a hymn by Seagrave,\r\nand more than one by Lyte; the \"Malabarian hymn\" (as it was called by\r\nJacobi) of Johann Schütz, \"All glory to the Sovereign Good,\" has been\r\npopular in England as well as Germany; and one of the most exquisite\r\nstrains of pious resignation ever written is \"Whate'er my God ordains is\r\nright,\" by Samuel Rodigast.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Neander.\r\n\r\nJoachim Neander, a schoolmaster at Düsseldorf, and a friend of Spener\r\nand Schütz (who died before the full development of the \"Pietistic\"\r\nschool), was the first man of eminence in the \"Reformed\" or Calvinistic\r\nChurch who imitated Lutheran hymnody. This he did, while suffering\r\npersecution from the elders of his own church for some other religious\r\npractices, which he had also learnt from Spener's example. As a poet, he\r\nis sometimes deficient in art; but there is feeling, warmth and\r\nsweetness in many of his \"Bundeslieder\" or \"Songs of the Covenant,\" and\r\nthey obtained general favour, both in the Reformed and in Lutheran\r\ncongregations. The Summer Hymn (\"O Thou true God alone\") and that on the\r\nglory of God in creation (\"Lo, heaven and earth and sea and air\") are\r\ninstances of his best style.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Schmolke.\r\n\r\n  Dessler.\r\n\r\n  Hiller.\r\n\r\n  Arnold.\r\n\r\n  Tersteegen.\r\n\r\n  Zinzendorf.\r\n\r\nWith the \"Pietists\" may be classed Benjamin Schmolke and Dessler,\r\nrepresentatives of the \"Orthodox\" division of Spener's school; Philipp\r\nFriedrich Hiller, their leading poet in South Germany; Gottfried Arnold\r\nand Gerhard Tersteegen, who were practically independent of\r\necclesiastical organization, though connected, one with the \"Orthodox\"\r\nand the other with the \"Reformed\" churches; and Nikolaus Ludwig, Graf\r\nvon Zinzendorf. Schmolke, a pastor in Silesia, called the Silesian Rist\r\n(1672-1737), was perhaps the most voluminous of all German hymn-writers.\r\nHe wrote 1188 religious poems and hymns, a large proportion of which do\r\nnot rise above mediocrity. His style, if less refined, is also less\r\nsubjective and more simple than that of most of his contemporaries.\r\nAmong his best and most attractive works, which indeed, it would be\r\ndifficult to praise too highly, are the \"Hosianna David's Sohn,\" for\r\nPalm Sunday--much resembling a shorter hymn by Jeremy Taylor; and the\r\nAscension, Whitsuntide and Sabbath hymns--\"Heavenward doth our journey\r\ntend,\" \"Come deck our feast to-day,\" and \"Light of light, enlighten me.\"\r\nDessler was a greater poet than Schmolke. Few hymns, of the subjective\r\nkind, are better than his \"I will not let Thee go, Thou Help in time of\r\nneed,\" \"O Friend of souls, how well is me,\" and \"Now, the pearly gates\r\nunfold.\" Hiller (1699-1769), was a pastor in Württemberg who, falling\r\ninto ill-health during the latter part of his ministry, published a\r\n_Geistliche Liederhöstlein_ in a didactic vein, with more taste than\r\npower, but (as Miss Winkworth says) in a tone of \"deep, thoughtful,\r\npractical piety.\" They were so well adapted to the wants of his people\r\nthat to this day Hiller's Casket is prized, next to their Bibles, by the\r\npeasantry of Württemberg; and the numerous emigrants from that part of\r\nGermany to America and other foreign countries generally take it with\r\nthem wherever they go. Arnold, a professor at Giessen, and afterwards a\r\npastor in Brandenburg, was a man of strong will, uncompromising\r\ncharacter and austere views of life, intolerant and controversial\r\ntowards those whose doctrine or practice he disapproved, and more\r\nindifferent to separatism and sectarianism than the \"orthodox\" generally\r\nthought right. His hymns, like those of Augustus M. Toplady, whom in\r\nthese respects he resembled, unite with considerable strength more\r\ngentleness and breadth of sympathy than might be expected from a man of\r\nsuch a character. Tersteegen (1697-1769), who never formally separated\r\nhimself from the \"Reformed\" communion, in which he was brought up, but\r\nwhose sympathies were with the Moravians and with Zinzendorf, was, of\r\nall the more copious German hymn-writers after Luther, perhaps the most\r\nremarkable man. Pietist, mystic and missionary, he was also a great\r\nreligious poet. His 111 hymns were published In 1731, in a volume called\r\n_Geistlicher Blumengärtlein inniger_ Seelen. They are intensely\r\nindividual, meditative and subjective. Wesley's adaptations of two--\"Lo!\r\nGod is here; let us adore,\" and \"Thou hidden Love of God, whose\r\nsource\"--are well known. Among those translated by Miss Winkworth, \"O\r\nGod, O Spirit, Light of all that live,\" and \"Come, brethren, let us go,\"\r\nare specimens which exhibit favourably his manner and power. Miss Cox\r\nspeaks of him as \"a gentle heaven-inspired soul, whose hymns are the\r\nreflection of a heavenly, happy life, his mind being full of a\r\nchild-like simplicity\"; and his own poem on the child-character, which\r\nMiss Winkworth has appropriately connected with Innocents' day (\"Dear\r\nSoul, couldst thou become a child\")--one of his best compositions,\r\nexquisitely conceived and expressed--shows that this was in truth the\r\nideal which he sought to realize. The hymns of Zinzendorf are often\r\ndisfigured by excess in the application of the language and imagery of\r\nhuman affections to divine objects; and this blemish is also found in\r\nmany later Moravian hymns. But one hymn, at least, of Zinzendorf may be\r\nmentioned with unqualified praise, as uniting the merits of force,\r\nsimplicity and brevity--\"Jesu, geh voran\" (\"Jesus, lead the way\"), which\r\nis taught to most children of religious parents in Germany. Wesley's\r\n\"Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness\" is a translation from Zinzendorf.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Gellert.\r\n\r\nThe transition from Tersteegen and Zinzendorf to Gellert and Klopstock\r\nmarks strongly the reaction against Pietism which took place towards the\r\nmiddle of the 18th century. The _Geistlichen Oden und Lieder_ of\r\nChristian F. Gellert were published in 1757, and are said to have been\r\nreceived with an enthusiasm almost like that which \"greeted Luther's\r\nhymns on their first appearance.\" It is a proof of the moderation both\r\nof the author and of his times that they were largely used, not only by\r\nProtestant congregations, but in those German Roman Catholic churches in\r\nwhich vernacular services had been established through the influence of\r\nthe emperor Joseph II. They became the model which was followed by most\r\nsucceeding hymn-writers, and exceeded all others in popularity till the\r\nclose of the century, when a new wave of thought was generated by the\r\nmovement which produced the French Revolution. Since that time they have\r\nbeen, perhaps, too much depreciated. They are, indeed, cold and\r\ndidactic, as compared with Scheffler or Tersteegen; but there is\r\nnevertheless in them a spirit of genuine practical piety; and, if not\r\nmarked by genius, they are pure in taste, and often terse, vigorous and\r\ngraceful.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Klopstock.\r\n\r\nKlopstock, the author of the _Messiah_, cannot be considered great as a\r\nhymn-writer, though his \"Sabbath Hymn\" (of which there is a version in\r\n_Hymns from the Land of Luther_) is simple and good. Generally his hymns\r\n(ten of which are translated in Sheppard's _Foreign Sacred Lyre_) are\r\nartificial and much too elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fouqué.\r\n\r\nOf the \"romantic\" school, which came in with the French Revolution, the\r\ntwo leading writers are Friedrich Leopold von Hardenberg, called\r\n\"Novalis,\" and Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, the celebrated author of\r\n_Undine_ and _Sintram_--both romance-writers, as well as poets. The\r\ngenius of Novalis was early lost to the world; he died in 1801, not\r\nthirty years old. Some of his hymns are very beautiful; but even in such\r\nworks as \"Though all to Thee were faithless,\" and \"If only He is mine,\"\r\nthere is a feeling of insulation and of despondency as to good in the\r\nactual world, which was perhaps inseparable from his ecclesiastical\r\nidealism. Fouqué survived till 1843. In his hymns there is the same deep\r\nflow of feeling, richness of imagery and charm of expression which\r\ndistinguishes his prose works. The two missionary hymns--\"Thou, solemn\r\nOcean, rollest to the strand,\" and \"In our sails all soft and\r\nsweetly\"--and the exquisite composition which finds its motive in the\r\ngospel narrative of blind Bartimeus, \"Was du vor tausend Jahren\" (finely\r\ntranslated both by Miss Winkworth and by Miss Cox), are among the best\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Spitta.\r\n\r\nThe later German hymn-writers of the 19th century belong, generally, to\r\nthe revived \"Pietistic\" school. Some of the best, Johann Baptist von\r\nAlbertini, Friedrich Adolf Krummacher, and especially Karl Johann\r\nPhilipp Spitta (1801-1859) have produced works not unworthy of the fame\r\nof their nation. Mr Massie, the able translator of Spitta's _Psalter und\r\nHarfe_ (Leipzig, 1833), speaks of it as having \"obtained for him in\r\nGermany a popularity only second to that of Paul Gerhardt.\" In Spitta's\r\npoems (for such they generally are, rather than hymns) the subjective\r\nand meditative tone is tempered, not ungracefully, with a didactic\r\nelement; and they are not disfigured by exaggerated sentiment, or by a\r\ntoo florid and rhetorical style.\r\n\r\n6. _British Hymnody._--After the Reformation, the development of hymnody\r\nwas retarded, in both parts of Great Britain, by the example and\r\ninfluence of Geneva. Archbishop Cranmer appears at one time to have been\r\ndisposed to follow Luther's course, and to present to the people, in an\r\nEnglish dress, some at least of the hymns of the ancient church. In a\r\nletter to King Henry VIII. (October 7, 1544), among some new\r\n\"processions\" which he had himself translated, into English, he mentions\r\nthe Easter hymn, \"Salve, festa dies, toto memorabilis aevo\" (\"Hail, glad\r\nday, to be joyfully kept through all generations\"), of Fortunatus. In\r\nthe \"Primer\" of 1535 (by Marshall) and the one of 1539 (by Bishop Hilsey\r\nof Rochester, published by order of the vicar-general Cromwell) there\r\nhad been several rude English hymns, none of them taken from ancient\r\nsources. King Henry's \"Primer\" of 1545 (commanded by his injunction of\r\nthe 6th of May 1545 to be used throughout his dominions) was formed on\r\nthe model of the daily offices of the Breviary; and it contains English\r\nmetrical translations from some of the best-known Ambrosian and other\r\nearly hymns. But in the succeeding reign different views prevailed. A\r\nnew direction had been given to the taste of the \"Reformed\"\r\ncongregations in France and Switzerland by the French metrical\r\ntranslation of the Old Testament Psalms, which appeared about 1540. This\r\nwas the joint work of Clement Marot, valet or groom of the chamber to\r\nFrancis I., and Theodore Beza, then a mere youth, fresh from his studies\r\nat Orleans.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Marot's Psalms.\r\n\r\nMarot's psalms were dedicated to the French king and the ladies of\r\nFrance, and, being set to popular airs, became fashionable. They were\r\nsung by Francis himself, the queen, the princesses and the courtiers,\r\nupon all sorts of secular occasions, and also, more seriously and\r\nreligiously, by the citizens and the common people. They were soon\r\nperceived to be a power on the side of the Reformation. Calvin, who had\r\nsettled at Geneva in the year of Marot's return to Paris, was then\r\norganizing his ecclesiastical system. He rejected the hymnody of the\r\nbreviaries and missals, and fell back upon the idea, anciently held by\r\nPaul of Samosata, and condemned by the fourth council of Toledo, that\r\nwhatever was sung in churches ought to be taken out of the Scriptures.\r\nMarot's Psalter, appearing thus opportunely, was introduced into his new\r\nsystem of worship, and appended to his catechism. On the other hand, it\r\nwas interdicted by the Roman Catholic priesthood. Thus it became a badge\r\nto the one party of the \"reformed\" profession, and to the other of\r\nheresy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sternhold and Hopkins.\r\n\r\nThe example thus set produced in England the translation commonly known\r\nas the \"Old Version\" of the Psalms. It was begun by Thomas Sternhold,\r\nwhose position in the household of Henry VIII., and afterwards of Edward\r\nVI., was similar to that of Marot with Francis I., and whose services to\r\nthe former of those kings were rewarded by a substantial legacy under\r\nhis will. Sternhold published versions of nineteen Psalms, with a\r\ndedication to King Edward, and died soon afterwards. A second edition\r\nappeared in 1551, with eighteen more Psalms added, of Sternhold's\r\ntranslating, and seven others by John Hopkins, a Suffolk clergyman. The\r\nwork was continued during Queen Mary's reign by British refugees at\r\nGeneva, the chief of whom were William Whittingham, afterwards dean of\r\nDurham, who succeeded John Knox as minister of the English congregation\r\nthere, and William Kethe or Keith, said by Strype to have been a\r\nScotsman. They published at Geneva in 1556 a service-book, containing\r\nfifty-one English metrical psalms, which number was increased, in later\r\neditions, to eighty-seven. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth, this\r\nGenevan Psalmody was at once brought into use in England--first\r\n(according to a letter of Bishop Jewell to Peter Martyr, dated 5th March\r\n1560) in one London church, from which it quickly spread to others both\r\nin London and in other cities. Jewell describes the effect produced by\r\nlarge congregations, of as many as 6000 persons, young and old, women\r\nand children, singing it after the sermons at St Paul's Cross--adding,\r\n\"Id sacrificos et diabolum aegre habet; vident enim sacras conciones hoc\r\npacto profundius descendere in hominum animos.\" The first edition of the\r\ncompleted \"Old Version\" (containing forty Psalms by Sternhold,\r\nsixty-seven by Hopkins, fifteen by Whittingham, six by Kethe and the\r\nrest by Thomas Norton the dramatist, Robert Wisdom, John Marckant and\r\nThomas Churchyard) appeared in 1562.\r\n\r\n  In the meantime, the Books of Common Prayer, of 1549, 1552 and 1559,\r\n  had been successively established as law by the acts of uniformity of\r\n  Edward VI. and Queen Elizabeth. In these no provision was made for the\r\n  use of any metrical psalm or hymn on any occasion whatever, except at\r\n  the consecration of bishops and the ordination of priests, in which\r\n  offices (first added in 1552) an English version of \"Veni Creator\"\r\n  (the longer of the two now in use) was appointed to be \"said or sung.\"\r\n  The canticles, \"Te Deum,\" \"Benedicite,\" the Nicene and Athanasian\r\n  Creeds, the \"Gloria in Excelsis,\" and some other parts of the\r\n  communion and other special offices were also directed to be \"said or\r\n  sung\"; and, by general rubrics, the chanting of the whole service was\r\n  allowed.\r\n\r\n  The silence, however, of the rubrics in these books as to any other\r\n  singing was not meant to exclude the use of psalms not expressly\r\n  appointed, when they could be used without interfering with the\r\n  prescribed order of any service. It was expressly provided by King\r\n  Edward's first act of uniformity (by later acts made applicable to the\r\n  later books) that it should be lawful \"for all men, as well in\r\n  churches, chapels, oratories or other places, to use openly any psalms\r\n  or prayers taken out of the Bible, at any due time, not letting or\r\n  omitting thereby the service, or any part thereof, mentioned in the\r\n  book.\" And Queen Elizabeth, by one of the injunctions issued in the\r\n  first year of her reign, declared her desire that the provision made,\r\n  \"in divers collegiate and also some parish churches, for singing in\r\n  the church, so as to promote the laudable service of music,\" should\r\n  continue. After allowing the use of \"a modest and distinct song in all\r\n  parts of the common prayers of the church, so that the same may be as\r\n  plainly understanded as if it were read without singing,\" the\r\n  injunction proceeded thus--\"And yet, nevertheless, for the comforting\r\n  of such that delight in music, it may be permitted that in the\r\n  beginning or in the end of the Common Prayer, either at morning or\r\n  evening, there may be sung an hymn, or such like song to the praise of\r\n  Almighty God, in the best sort of melody and music that may be\r\n  conveniently devised, having respect that the sentence\" (i.e. sense)\r\n  \"of hymn may be understanded and perceived.\"\r\n\r\n  The \"Old Version,\" when published (by John Daye, for the Stationers'\r\n  Company, \"cum gratia et privilegio Regiae Majestatis\"), bore upon the\r\n  face of it that it was \"newly set forth, and allowed to be sung of the\r\n  people in churches, before and after morning and evening prayer, as\r\n  also before and after the sermon.\" The question of its authority has\r\n  been at different times much debated, chiefly by Peter Heylyn and\r\n  Thomas Warton on one side (both of whom disliked and disparaged it),\r\n  and by William Beveridge, bishop of St Asaph, and the Rev. H. J. Todd\r\n  on the other. Heylyn says, it was \"permitted rather than allowed,\"\r\n  which seems to be a distinction without much difference. \"Allowance,\"\r\n  which is all that the book claimed for itself, is authorization by way\r\n  of permission, not of commandment. Its publication in that form could\r\n  hardly have been licensed, nor could it have passed into use as it did\r\n  without question, throughout the churches of England, unless it had\r\n  been \"allowed\" by some authority then esteemed to be sufficient.\r\n  Whether that authority was royal or ecclesiastical does not appear,\r\n  nor (considering the proviso in King Edward's act of uniformity, and\r\n  Queen Elizabeth's injunctions) is it very important. No inference can\r\n  justly be drawn from the inability of inquirers, in Heylyn's time or\r\n  since, to discover any public record bearing upon this subject, many\r\n  public documents of that period having been lost.\r\n\r\nIn this book, as published in 1562, and for many years afterwards, there\r\nwere (besides the versified Psalms) eleven metrical versions of the \"Te\r\nDeum,\" canticles, Lord's Prayer (the best of which is that of the\r\n\"Benedicite\"); and also \"Da pacem, Domine,\" a hymn suitable to the\r\ntimes, rendered into English from Luther; two original hymns of praise,\r\nto be sung before morning and evening prayer; two penitential hymns (one\r\nof them the \"humble lamentation of a sinner\"); and a hymn of faith,\r\nbeginning, \"Lord, in Thee is all my trust.\" In these respects, and also\r\nin the tunes which accompanied the words (stated by Dr Charles Burney,\r\nin his _History of Music_, to be German, and not French), there was a\r\ndeparture from the Genevan platform. Some of these hymns, and some of\r\nthe psalms also (e.g. those by Robert Wisdom, being alternative\r\nversions), were omitted at a later period; and many alterations and\r\nsupposed amendments were from time to time made by unknown hands in the\r\npsalms which remained, so that the text, as now printed, is in many\r\nplaces different from that of 1562.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scotch Psalms.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the General Assembly of the kirk caused to be printed at\r\nEdinburgh in 1564, and enjoined the use of, a book entitled _The Form of\r\nPrayers and Ministry of the Sacraments used in the English Church at\r\nGeneva, approved and received by the Church of Scotland; whereto,\r\nbesides that was in the former books, are also added sundry other\r\nprayers, with the whole Psalms of David in English metre_. This\r\ncontained, from the \"Old Version,\" translations of forty Psalms by\r\nSternhold, fifteen by Whittingham, twenty-six by Kethe and thirty-five\r\nby Hopkins. Of the remainder two were by John Pulleyn (one of the\r\nGenevan refugees, who became archdeacon of Colchester); six by Robert\r\nPont, Knox's son-in-law, who was a minister of the kirk, and also a lord\r\nof session; and fourteen signed with the initials I. C., supposed to be\r\nJohn Craig; one was anonymous, eight were attributed to N., two to M.\r\nand one to T. N. respectively.\r\n\r\nSo matters continued in both churches until the Civil War. During the\r\ninterval, King James I. conceived the project of himself making a new\r\nversion of the Psalms, and appears to have translated thirty-one of\r\nthem--the correction of which, together with the translation of the\r\nrest, he entrusted to Sir William Alexander, afterwards earl of\r\nStirling. Sir William having completed his task, King Charles I. had it\r\nexamined and approved by several archbishops and bishops of England,\r\nScotland and Ireland, and caused it to be printed in 1631 at the Oxford\r\nUniversity Press, as the work of King James; and, by an order under the\r\nroyal sign manual, recommended its use in all churches of his dominions.\r\nIn 1634 he enjoined the Privy Council of Scotland not to suffer any\r\nother psalms, \"of any edition whatever,\" to be printed in or imported\r\ninto that kingdom. In 1636 it was republished, and was attached to the\r\nfamous Scottish service-book, with which the troubles began in 1637. It\r\nneed hardly be added that the king did not succeed in bringing this\r\nPsalter into use in either kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhen the Long Parliament undertook, in 1642, the task of altering the\r\nliturgy, its attention was at the same time directed to psalmody. It had\r\nto judge between two rival translations of the Psalms--one by Francis\r\nRouse, a member of the House of Commons, afterwards one of Cromwell's\r\ncouncillors and finally provost of Eton; the other by William Barton, a\r\nclergyman of Leicester. The House of Lords favoured Barton, the House of\r\nCommons Rouse, who had made much use of the labours of Sir William\r\nAlexander. Both versions were printed by order of parliament, and were\r\nreferred for consideration to the Westminster Assembly. They decided in\r\nfavour of Rouse. His version, as finally amended, was published in 1646,\r\nunder an order of the House of Commons dated 14th November 1645. In the\r\nfollowing year it was recommended by the parliament to the General\r\nAssembly at Edinburgh, who appointed a committee, with large powers, to\r\nprepare a revised Psalter, recommending to their consideration not only\r\nRouse's book but that of 1564, and two other versions (by Zachary Boyd\r\nand Sir William Mure of Rowallan), then lately executed in Scotland. The\r\nresult of the labours of this committee was the \"Paraphrase\" of the\r\nPsalms, which, in 1649-1650, by the concurrent authority of the General\r\nAssembly and the committee of estates, was ordered to be exclusively\r\nused throughout the church of Scotland. Some use was made in the\r\npreparation of this book of the versions to which the attention of the\r\nrevisers had been directed, and also of Barton's; but its basis was that\r\nof Rouse. It was received in Scotland with great favour, which it has\r\never since retained; and it is fairly entitled to the praise of striking\r\na tolerable medium between the rude homeliness of the \"Old,\" and the\r\nartificial modernism of the \"New\" English versions--perhaps as great a\r\nsuccess as was possible for such an undertaking. Sir Walter Scott is\r\nsaid to have dissuaded any attempt to alter it, and to have pronounced\r\nit, \"with all its acknowledged occasional harshness, so beautiful, that\r\nany alterations must eventually prove only so many blemishes.\" No\r\nfurther step towards any authorized hymnody was taken by the kirk of\r\nScotland till the following century.\r\n\r\nIn England, two changes bearing on church hymnody were made upon the\r\nrevision of the prayer-book after the Restoration, in 1661-1662. One was\r\nthe addition, in the offices for consecrating bishops and ordaining\r\npriests, of the shorter version of \"Veni Creator\" (\"Come, Holy Ghost,\r\nour souls inspire\"), as an alternative form. The other, and more\r\nimportant, was the insertion of the rubric after the third collect, at\r\nmorning and evening prayer: \"In quires and places where they sing, here\r\nfolloweth the anthem.\" By this rubric synodical and parliamentary\r\nauthority was given for the interruption, at that point, of the\r\nprescribed order of the service by singing an anthem, the choice of\r\nwhich was left to the discretion of the minister. Those actually used,\r\nunder this authority, were for some time only unmetrical passages of\r\nscripture, set to music by Blow, Purcell and other composers, of the\r\nsame kind with the anthems still generally sung in cathedral and\r\ncollegiate churches. But the word \"anthem\" had no technical\r\nsignification which could be an obstacle to the use under this rubric of\r\nmetrical hymns.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tate and Brady.\r\n\r\nThe \"New Version\" of the Psalms, by Dr Nicholas Brady and the\r\npoet-laureate Nahum Tate (both Irishmen), appeared in 1696, under the\r\nsanction of an order in council of William III., \"allowing and\r\npermitting\" its use \"in all such churches, chapels and congregations as\r\nshould think fit to receive it.\" Dr Compton, bishop of London,\r\nrecommended it to his diocese. No hymns were then appended to it; but\r\nthe authors added a \"supplement\" in 1703, which received an exactly\r\nsimilar sanction from an order in council of Queen Anne. In that\r\nsupplement there were several new versions of the canticles, and of the\r\n\"Veni Creator\"; a variation of the old \"humble lamentation of a sinner\";\r\nsix hymns for Christmas, Easter and Holy Communion (all versions or\r\nparaphrases of scripture), which are still usually printed at the end of\r\nthe prayer-books containing the new version; and a hymn \"on the divine\r\nuse of music\"--all accompanied by tunes. The authors also reprinted,\r\nwith very good taste, the excellent version of the \"Benedicite\" which\r\nappeared in the book of 1562. Of the hymns in this \"supplement,\" one\r\n(\"While shepherds watched their flocks by night\") greatly exceeded the\r\nrest in merit. It has been ascribed to Tate, but it has a character of\r\nsimplicity unlike the rest of his works.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Old and new versions compared.\r\n\r\nThe relative merits of the \"Old\" and \"New\" versions have been very\r\nvariously estimated. Competent judges have given the old the praise, which\r\ncertainly cannot be accorded to the new, of fidelity to the Hebrew. In\r\nboth, it must be admitted, that those parts which have poetical merit are\r\nfew and far between; but a reverent taste is likely to be more offended by\r\nthe frequent sacrifice, in the new, of depth of tone and accuracy of sense\r\nto a fluent commonplace correctness of versification and diction, than by\r\nany excessive homeliness in the old. In both, however, some psalms, or\r\nportions of psalms, are well enough rendered to entitle them to a\r\npermanent place in the hymn-books--especially the 8th, and parts of the\r\n18th Psalm, by Sternhold; the 57th, 84th and 100th, by Hopkins; the 23rd,\r\n34th and 36th, and part of the 148th, by Tate and Brady.\r\n\r\nThe judgment which a fastidious critic might be disposed to pass upon\r\nboth these books may perhaps be considerably mitigated by comparing them\r\nwith the works of other labourers in the same field, of whom Holland, in\r\nhis interesting volumes entitled _Psalmists of Great Britain_,\r\nenumerates above 150. Some of them have been real poets--the celebrated\r\nearl of Surrey, Sir Philip Sidney and his sister the countess of\r\nPembroke, George Sandys, George Wither, John Milton and John Keble. In\r\ntheir versions, as might be expected, there are occasional gleams of\r\npower and beauty, exceeding anything to be found in Sternhold and\r\nHopkins, or Tate and Brady; but even in the best these are rare, and\r\nchiefly occur where the strict idea of translation has been most widely\r\ndeparted from. In all of them, as a rule, the life and spirit, which in\r\nprose versions of the psalms are so wonderfully preserved, have\r\ndisappeared. The conclusion practically suggested by so many failures is\r\nthat the difficulties of metrical translation, always great, are in this\r\ncase insuperable; and that, while the psalms like other parts of\r\nscripture are abundantly suggestive of motive and material for\r\nhymnographers, it is by assimilation and adaptation, and not by any\r\nattempt to transform their exact sense into modern poetry, that they may\r\nbe best used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n  The order in council of 1703 is the latest act of any public authority\r\n  by which an express sanction has been given to the use of psalms or\r\n  hymns in the Church of England. At the end, indeed, of many\r\n  Prayer-books, till about the middle of the 19th century, there were\r\n  commonly found, besides some of the hymns sanctioned by that order in\r\n  council, or of those contained in the book of 1562, a sacramental and\r\n  a Christmas hymn by Doddridge; a Christmas hymn (varied by Martin\r\n  Madan) from Charles Wesley; an Easter hymn of the 18th century,\r\n  beginning \"Jesus Christ has risen to-day\"; and abridgments Bishop\r\n  Ken's Morning and Evening Hymns. These additions first began to be\r\n  made in or about 1791, in London editions of the Prayer-book and\r\n  Psalter, at the mere will and pleasure (so far as appears) of the\r\n  printers. They had no sort of authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n  English congregational hymnody.\r\n\r\nIn the state of authority, opinion and practice disclosed by the\r\npreceding narrative may be found the true explanation of the fact that,\r\nin the country of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare and Milton, and\r\nnotwithstanding the example of Germany, no native congregational hymnody\r\nworthy of the name arose till after the commencement of the 18th\r\ncentury. Yet there was no want of appreciation of the power and value\r\nof congregational church music. Milton could write, before 1645:--\r\n\r\n  \"There let the pealing organ blow\r\n   To the full-voiced quire below\r\n   In service high, and anthems clear,\r\n   As may with sweetness through mine ear\r\n   Dissolve me into ecstasies,\r\n   And bring all Heaven before mine eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Mace, in his _Music's Monument_ (1676), thus described the effect\r\nof psalm-singing before sermons by the congregation in York Minster on\r\nSundays, during the siege of 1644: \"When that vast concording unity of\r\nthe whole congregational chorus came thundering in, even so as it made\r\nthe very ground shake under us, oh, the unutterable ravishing soul's\r\ndelight! in the which I was so transported and wrapt up in high\r\ncontemplations that there was no room left in my whole man, body, soul\r\nand spirit, for anything below divine and heavenly raptures; nor could\r\nthere possibly be anything to which that very singing might be truly\r\ncompared, except the right apprehension or conceiving of that glorious\r\nand miraculous quire, recorded in the scriptures at the dedication of\r\nthe temple.\" Nor was there any want of men well qualified, and by the\r\nturn of their minds predisposed, to shine in this branch of literature.\r\nSome (like Sandys, Boyd and Barton) devoted themselves altogether to\r\nparaphrases of other scriptures as well as the psalms. Others (like\r\nGeorge Herbert, and Francis and John Quarles) moralized, meditated,\r\nsoliloquized and allegorized in verse. Without reckoning these, there\r\nwere a few, even before the Restoration, who came very near to the ideal\r\nof hymnody.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Wedderburn.\r\n\r\nFirst in time is the Scottish poet John Wedderburn, who translated\r\nseveral of Luther's hymns, and in his _Compendious Book of Godly and\r\nSpiritual Songs_ added others of his own (or his brothers') composition.\r\nSome of these poems, published before 1560, are of uncommon excellence,\r\nuniting ease and melody of rhythm, and structural skill, with grace of\r\nexpression, and simplicity, warmth and reality of religious feeling.\r\nThose entitled \"Give me thy heart,\" \"Go, heart,\" and \"Leave me not,\"\r\nwhich will be found in a collection of 1860 called _Sacred Songs of\r\nScotland_, require little, beyond the change of some archaisms of\r\nlanguage, to adapt them for church or domestic use at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dickson.\r\n\r\nNext come the two hymns of \"The new Jerusalem,\" by an English Roman\r\nCatholic priest signing himself F. B. P. (supposed to be \"Francis Baker,\r\nPresbyter\"), and by another Scottish poet, David Dickson, of which the\r\nhistory is given by Dr Bonar in his edition of Dickson's work. This\r\n(Dickson's), which begins \"O mother dear, Jerusalem,\" and has long been\r\npopular in Scotland, is a variation and amplification by the addition of\r\na large number of new stanzas of the English original, beginning\r\n\"Jerusalem, my happy home,\" written in Queen Elizabeth's time, and\r\nprinted (as appears by a copy in the British Museum) about 1616, when\r\nDickson was still young. Both have an easy natural flow, and a simple\r\nhappy rendering of the beautiful scriptural imagery upon the subject,\r\nwith a spirit of primitive devotion uncorrupted by medieval\r\npeculiarities. The English hymn of which some stanzas are now often sung\r\nin churches is the true parent of the several shorter forms,--all of\r\nmore than common merit,--which, in modern hymn-books, begin with the\r\nsame first line, but afterwards deviate from the original. Kindred to\r\nthese is the very fine and faithful translation, by Dickson's\r\ncontemporary Drummond of Hawthornden of the ancient \"Urbs beata\r\nHierusalem\" (\"Jerusalem, that place divine\"). Other ancient hymns (two\r\nof Thomas Aquinas, and the \"Dies Irae\") were also well translated, in\r\n1646, by Richard Crashaw, after he had become a Roman Catholic and had\r\nbeen deprived by the parliament of his fellowship at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Wither.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the sacred poets of the first two Stuart reigns in\r\nEngland was George Wither. His _Hymnes and Songs of the Church_ appeared\r\nin 1622-1623, under a patent of King James I., by which they were\r\ndeclared \"worthy and profitable to be inserted, in convenient manner and\r\ndue place, into every English Psalm-book to metre.\" His _Hallelujah_\r\n(in which some of the former _Hymnes and Songs_ were repeated) followed\r\nin 1641. Some of the _Hymnes and Songs_ were set to music by Orlando\r\nGibbons, and those in both books were written to be sung, though there\r\nis no evidence that the author contemplated the use of any of them in\r\nchurches. They included hymns for every day in the week (founded, as\r\nthose contributed nearly a century afterwards by Charles Coffin to the\r\nParisian Breviary also were, upon the successive works of the days of\r\ncreation); hymns for all the church seasons and festivals, including\r\nsaints' days; hymns for various public occasions; and hymns of prayer,\r\nmeditation and instruction, for all sorts and conditions of men, under a\r\ngreat variety of circumstances--being at once a \"Christian Year\" and a\r\nmanual of practical piety. Many of them rise to a very high point of\r\nexcellence,--particularly the \"general invitation to praise God\" (\"Come,\r\nO come, in pious lays\"), with which _Hallelujah_ opens; the\r\nthanksgivings for peace and for victory, the Coronation Hymn, a\r\nChristmas, an Epiphany, and an Easter Hymn, and one for St Bartholomew's\r\nday (Hymns 1, 74, 75, and 84 in part i., and 26, 29, 36 and 54 in part\r\nii. of _Hallelujah_).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cosin.\r\n\r\nJohn Cosin, afterwards bishop of Durham, published in 1627 a volume of\r\n\"Private Devotions,\" for the canonical hours and other occasions. In\r\nthis there are seven or eight hymns of considerable merit,--among them a\r\nvery good version of the Ambrosian \"Jam lucis orto sidere,\" and the\r\nshorter version of the \"Veni Creator,\" which was introduced after the\r\nRestoration into the consecration and ordination services of the Church\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Milton.\r\n\r\nThe hymns of Milton (on the Nativity, Passion, Circumcision and \"at a\r\nSolemn Music\"), written about 1629, in his early manhood, were probably\r\nnot intended for singing; but they are odes full of characteristic\r\nbeauty and power.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jeremy Taylor.\r\n\r\nDuring the Commonwealth, in 1654, Jeremy Taylor published at the end of\r\nhis _Golden Grove_, twenty-one hymns, described by himself as\r\n\"celebrating the mysteries and chief festivals of the year, according to\r\nthe manner of the ancient church, fitted to the fancy and devotion of\r\nthe younger and pious persons, apt for memory, and to be joined, to\r\ntheir other prayers.\" Of these, his accomplished editor, Bishop Heber,\r\njustly says:--\r\n\r\n  \"They are in themselves, and on their own account, very interesting\r\n  compositions. Their metre, indeed, which is that species of spurious\r\n  Pindaric which was fashionable with his contemporaries, is an\r\n  obstacle, and must always have been one, to their introduction into\r\n  public or private psalmody; and the mixture of that alloy of conceits\r\n  and quibbles which was an equally frequent and still greater\r\n  defilement of some of the finest poetry of the 17th century will\r\n  materially diminish their effect as devotional or descriptive odes.\r\n  Yet, with all these faults, they are powerful, affecting, and often\r\n  harmonious; there are many passages of which Cowley need not have been\r\n  ashamed, and some which remind us, not disadvantageously, of the\r\n  corresponding productions of Milton.\"\r\n\r\nHe mentions particularly the advent hymn (\"Lord, come away\"), part of\r\nthe hymn \"On heaven,\" and (as \"more regular in metre, and in words more\r\napplicable to public devotion\") the \"Prayer for Charity\" (\"Full of\r\nmercy, full of love\").\r\n\r\n\r\n  Restoration period.\r\n\r\nThe epoch of the Restoration produced in 1664 Samuel Crossman's _Young\r\nMan's Calling_, with a few \"Divine Meditations\" in verse attached to it;\r\nin 1668 John Austin's _Devotions in the ancient way of offices, with\r\npsalms, hymns and prayers for every day in the week and every holyday in\r\nthe year_; and in 1681 Richard Baxter's _Poetical Fragments_. In these\r\nbooks there are altogether seven or eight hymns, the whole or parts of\r\nwhich are extremely good: Crossman's \"New Jerusalem\" (\"Sweet place,\r\nsweet place alone\"), one of the best of that class, and \"My life's a\r\nshade, my days\"; Austin's \"Hark, my soul, how everything,\" \"Fain would\r\nmy thoughts fly up to Thee,\" \"Lord, now the time returns,\" \"Wake all my\r\nhopes, lift up your eyes\"; and Baxter's \"My whole, though broken heart,\r\nO Lord,\" and \"Ye holy angels bright.\" Austin's _Offices_ (he was a Roman\r\nCatholic) seem to have attracted much attention. Theophilus Dorrington,\r\nin 1686, published variations of them under the title of _Reformed_\r\n_Devotions_; George Hickes, the non-juror, wrote one of his numerous\r\nrecommendatory prefaces to S. Hopton's edition; and the Wesleys, in\r\ntheir earliest hymn-book, adopted hymns from them, with little\r\nalteration. These writers were followed by John Mason in 1683, and\r\nThomas Shepherd in 1692,--the former, a country clergyman, much esteemed\r\nby Baxter and other Nonconformists; the latter himself a Nonconformist,\r\nwho finally emigrated to America. Between these two men there was a\r\nclose alliance, Shepherd's _Penitential Cries_ being published as an\r\naddition to the _Spiritual Songs_ of Mason. Their hymns came into early\r\nuse in several Nonconformist congregations; but, with the exception of\r\none by Mason (\"There is a stream which issues forth\"), they are not\r\nsuitable for public singing. In those of Mason there is often a very\r\nfine vein of poetry; and later authors have, by extracts or centoes from\r\ndifferent parts of his works (where they were not disfigured by his\r\ngeneral quaintness), constructed several hymns of more than average\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nThree other eminent names of the 17th century remain to be mentioned,\r\nJohn Dryden, Bishop Ken and Bishop Simon Patrick; with which may be\r\nassociated that of Addison, though he wrote in the 18th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dryden, Ken.\r\n\r\n  Patrick\r\n\r\n  Addison.\r\n\r\nDryden's translation of \"Veni Creator\" a cold and laboured performance,\r\nis to be met with in many hymn-books. Abridgments of Ken's morning and\r\nevening hymns are in all. These, with the midnight hymn, which is not\r\ninferior to them, first appeared In 1697, appended to the third edition\r\nof the author's _Manual of Prayers for Winchester Scholars_. Between\r\nthese and a large number of other hymns (on the attributes of God, and\r\nfor the festivals of the church) published by Bishop Ken after 1703 the\r\ncontrast is remarkable. The universal acceptance of the morning and\r\nevening hymns is due to their transparent simplicity, warm but not\r\noverstrained devotion, and extremely popular style. Those afterwards\r\npublished have no such qualities. They are mystical, florid, stiff,\r\ndidactic and seldom poetical, and deserve the neglect into which they\r\nhave fallen. Bishop Patrick's hymns were chiefly translations from the\r\nLatin, most of them from Prudentius. The best is a version of \"Alleluia\r\ndulce carmen.\" Of the five attributed to Addison, not more than three\r\nare adapted to public singing; one (\"The spacious firmament on high\") is\r\na very perfect and finished composition, taking rank among the best\r\nhymns in the English language.[3]\r\n\r\nFrom the preface to Simon Browne's hymns, published in 1720, we learn\r\nthat down to the time of Dr Watts the only hymns known to be \"in common\r\nuse, either in private families or in Christian assemblies,\" were those\r\nof Barton, Mason and Shepherd, together with \"an attempt to turn some of\r\nGeorge Herbert's poems into common metre,\" and a few sacramental hymns\r\nby authors now forgotten, named Joseph Boyse (1660-1728) and Joseph\r\nStennett. Of the 1410 authors of original British hymns enumerated in\r\nDaniel Sedgwick's catalogue, published in 1863, 1213 are of later date\r\nthan 1707; and, if any correct enumeration could be made of the total\r\nnumber of hymns of all kinds published in Great Britain before and after\r\nthat date, the proportion subsequent to 1707 would be very much larger.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Independents, as represented by Dr Isaac Watts, have a just\r\nclaim to be considered the real founders of modern English hymnody.\r\nWatts was the first to understand the nature of the want, and, by the\r\npublication of his _Hymns_ in 1707-1709, and _Psalms_ (not translations,\r\nbut hymns founded on psalms) in 1709, he led the way in providing for\r\nit. His immediate followers were Simon Browne and Philip Doddridge.\r\nLater in the 18th century, Joseph Hart, Thomas Gibbons, Miss Anne\r\nSteele, Samuel Medley, Samuel Stennett, John Ryland, Benjamin Beddome\r\nand Joseph Swain succeeded to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Watts.\r\n\r\nAmong these writers, most of whom produced some hymns of merit, and\r\nseveral are extremely voluminous, Isaac Watts and Philip Doddridge are\r\npre-eminent. It has been the fashion with some to disparage Watts, as if\r\nhe had never risen above the level of his _Hymns for Little Children_.\r\nNo doubt his taste is often faulty, and his style very unequal, but,\r\nlooking to the good, and disregarding the large quantity of inferior\r\nmatter, it is probable that more hymns which approach to a very high\r\nstandard of excellence, and are at the same time suitable for\r\ncongregational use, may be found in his works than in those of any other\r\nEnglish writer. Such are \"When I survey the wondrous cross,\" \"Jesus\r\nshall reign where'er the sun\" (and also another adaptation of the same\r\n72nd Psalm), \"Before Jehovah's awful throne\" (first line of which,\r\nhowever, is not his, but Wesley's), \"Joy to the world, the Lord is\r\ncome,\" \"My soul, repeat His praise,\" \"Why do we mourn departing\r\nfriends,\" \"There is a land of pure delight,\" \"Our God, our help in ages\r\npast,\" \"Up to the hills I lift mine eyes,\" and many more. It is true\r\nthat in some of these cases dross is found in the original poems mixed\r\nwith gold; but the process of separation, by selection without change,\r\nis not difficult. As long as pure nervous English, unaffected fervour,\r\nstrong simplicity and liquid yet manly sweetness are admitted to be\r\ncharacteristics of a good hymn, works such as these must command\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Doddridge.\r\n\r\nDoddridge is, generally, much more laboured and artificial; but his\r\nplace also as a hymn-writer ought to be determined, not by his failures,\r\nbut by his successes, of which the number is not inconsiderable. In his\r\nbetter works he is distinguished by a graceful and pointed, sometimes\r\neven a noble style. His \"Hark, the glad sound, the Saviour comes\" (which\r\nis, indeed, his masterpiece), is as sweet, vigorous and perfect a\r\ncomposition as can anywhere be found. Two other hymns, \"How gentle God's\r\ncommands,\" and that which, in a form slightly varied, became the \"O God\r\nof Bethel, by whose hand,\" of the Scottish \"Paraphrases,\" well represent\r\nhis softer manner.\r\n\r\nOf the other followers in the school of Watts, Miss Anne Steele\r\n(1717-1778) is the most popular and perhaps the best. Her hymn beginning\r\n\"Far from these narrow scenes of night\" deserves high praise, even by\r\nthe side of other good performances on the same subject.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Watts was felt in Scotland, and among the first whom it\r\nreached there was Ralph Erskine. This seems to have been after the\r\npublication of Erskine's _Gospel Sonnets_, which appeared in 1732, five\r\nyears before he joined his brother Ebenezer in the Secession Church. The\r\n_Gospel Sonnets_ became, as some have said, a \"people's classic\"; but\r\nthere is in them very little which belongs to the category of hymnody.\r\nMore than nineteen-twentieths of this very curious book are occupied\r\nwith what are, in fact, theological treatises and catechisms, mystical\r\nmeditations on Christ as a bridegroom or husband, and spiritual enigmas,\r\nparadoxes, and antithetical conceits, versified, it is true, but of a\r\nquality of which such lines as--\r\n\r\n  \"Faith's certain by fiducial arts,\r\n   Sense by its evidential facts,\"\r\n\r\nmay be taken as a sample. The grains of poetry scattered through this\r\nlarge mass of Calvinistic divinity are very few; yet in one short\r\npassage of seven stanzas (\"O send me down a draught of love\"), the fire\r\nburns with a brightness so remarkable as to justify a strong feeling of\r\nregret that the gift which this writer evidently had in him was not more\r\noften cultivated. Another passage, not so well sustained, but of\r\nconsiderable beauty (part of the last piece under the title \"The\r\nbeliever's soliloquy\"), became afterwards, in the hands of John\r\nBerridge, the foundation of a very striking hymn (\"O happy saints, who\r\nwalk in light\").\r\n\r\nAfter his secession, Ralph Erskine published two paraphrases of the\r\n\"Song of Solomon,\" and a number of other \"Scripture songs,\" paraphrased,\r\nin like manner, from the Old and New Testaments. In these the influence\r\nof Watts became very apparent, not only by a change in the writer's\r\ngeneral style, but by the direct appropriation of no small quantity of\r\nmatter from Dr Watts's hymns, with variations which were not always\r\nimprovements. His paraphrases of I Cor. i. 24; Gal. vi. 14; Heb. vi.\r\n17-19; Rev. v. 11, 12, vii. 10-17, and xii. 7-12 are little else than\r\nWatts transformed. One of these (Rev. vii. 10-17) is interesting as a\r\nvariation and improvement, intermediate between the original and the\r\nform which it ultimately assumed as the 66th \"Paraphrase\" of the Church\r\nof Scotland, of Watts's \"What happy men or angels these,\" and \"These\r\nglorious minds, how bright they shine.\" No one can compare it with its\r\nultimate product, \"How bright these glorious spirits shine,\" without\r\nperceiving that William Cameron followed Erskine, and only added finish\r\nand grace to his work,--both excelling Watts, in this instance, in\r\nsimplicity as well as in conciseness.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scottish paraphrases.\r\n\r\nOf the contributions to the authorized \"Paraphrases\" (with the\r\nsettlement of which committees of the General Assembly of the Church of\r\nScotland were occupied from 1745, or earlier, till 1781), the most\r\nnoteworthy, besides the two already mentioned, were those of John\r\nMorrison and those claimed for Michael Bruce. The obligations of these\r\n\"Paraphrases\" to English hymnody, already traced in some instances (to\r\nwhich may be added the adoption from Addison of three out of the five\r\n\"hymns\" appended to them), are perceptible in the vividness and force\r\nwith which these writers, while adhering with a severe simplicity to the\r\nsense of the passages of Scripture which they undertook to render,\r\nfulfilled the conception of a good original hymn. Morrison's \"The race\r\nthat long in darkness pined\" and \"Come, let us to the Lord our God,\" and\r\nBruce's \"Where high the heavenly temple stands\" (if this was really\r\nhis), are well entitled to that praise. The advocates of Bruce in the\r\ncontroversy, not yet closed, as to the poems said to have been entrusted\r\nby him to John Logan, and published by Logan in his own name, also claim\r\nfor him the credit of having varied the paraphrase \"Behold, the mountain\r\nof the Lord,\" from its original form, as printed by the committee of the\r\nGeneral Assembly in 1745, by some excellent touches.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Methodist hymns.\r\n\r\nAttention must now be directed to the hymns produced by the \"Methodist\"\r\nmovement, which began about 1738, and which afterwards became divided,\r\nbetween those esteemed Arminian, under John Wesley, those who adhered to\r\nthe Moravians, when the original alliance between that body and the\r\nfounders of Methodism was dissolved, and the Calvinists, of whom\r\nWhitfield was the leader, and Selina, countess of Huntingdon, the\r\npatroness. Each of these sections had its own hymn-writers, some of whom\r\ndid, and others did not, secede from the Church of England. The\r\nWesleyans had Charles Wesley, Robert Seagrave and Thomas Olivers; the\r\nMoravians, John Cennick, with whom, perhaps, may be classed John Byrom,\r\nwho imbibed the mystical ideas of some of the German schools; the\r\nCalvinists, Augustus Montague Toplady, John Berridge, William Williams,\r\nMartin Madan, Thomas Haweis, Rowland Hill, John Newton and William\r\nCowper.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Charles Wesley.\r\n\r\nAmong all these writers, the palm undoubtedly belongs to Charles Wesley.\r\nIn the first volume of hymns published by the two brothers are several\r\ngood translations from the German, believed to be by John Wesley, who,\r\nalthough he translated and adapted, is not supposed to have written any\r\noriginal hymns; and the influence of German hymnody, particularly of the\r\nworks of Paul Gerhardt, Scheffler, Tersteegen and Zinzendorf, may be\r\ntraced in a large proportion of Charles Wesley's works. He is more\r\nsubjective and meditative than Watts and his school; there is a didactic\r\nturn, even in his most objective pieces, as, for example, in his\r\nChristmas and Easter hymns; most of his works are supplicatory, and his\r\nfaults are connected with the same habit of mind. He is apt to repeat\r\nthe same thoughts, and to lose force by redundancy--he runs sometimes\r\neven to a tedious length; his hymns are not always symmetrically\r\nconstructed, or well balanced and finished off. But he has great truth,\r\ndepth and variety of feeling; his diction is manly and always to the\r\npoint; never florid, though sometimes passionate and not free from\r\nexaggeration; often vivid and picturesque. Of his spirited style there\r\nare few better examples than \"O for a thousand tongues to sing,\" \"Blow\r\nye the trumpet, blow,\" \"Rejoice, the Lord is King\" and \"Come, let us\r\njoin our friends above\"; of his more tender vein, \"Happy soul, thy days\r\nare ended\"; and of his fervid contemplative style (without going beyond\r\nhymns fit for general use), \"O Thou who earnest from above,\" \"Forth in\r\nThy name, O Lord, I go\" and \"Eternal beam of light divine.\" With those\r\nwhose taste is for hymns in which warm religious feelings are warmly and\r\ndemonstratively expressed, \"Jesus, lover of my soul,\" is as popular as\r\nany of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Olivers.\r\n\r\nOf the other Wesleyan hymn-writers, Olivers, originally a Welsh\r\nshoemaker and afterwards a preacher, is the most remarkable. He is the\r\nauthor of only two works, both odes, in a stately metre, and from their\r\nlength unfit for congregational singing, but one of them, \"The God of\r\nAbraham praise,\" an ode of singular power and beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cennick, Hammond, Byrom.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian Methodists produced few hymns now available for general\r\nuse. The best are Cennick's \"Children of the heavenly King\" and\r\nHammond's \"Awake and sing the song of Moses and the Lamb,\" the former of\r\nwhich (abridged), and the latter as varied by Madan, are found in many\r\nhymn-books, and are deservedly esteemed. John Byrom, whose name we have\r\nthought it convenient to connect with these, though he did not belong to\r\nthe Moravian community, was the author of a Christmas hymn (\"Christians\r\nawake, salute the happy morn\") which enjoys great popularity; and also\r\nof a short subjective hymn, very fine both in feeling and in expression,\r\n\"My spirit longeth for Thee within my troubled breast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Toplady.\r\n\r\nThe contributions of the Calvinistic Methodists to English hymnody are\r\nof greater extent and value. Few writers of hymns had higher gifts than\r\nToplady, author of \"Rock of ages,\" by some esteemed the finest in the\r\nEnglish language. He was a man of ardent temperament, enthusiastic zeal,\r\nstrong convictions and great energy of character. \"He had,\" says one of\r\nhis biographers, \"the courage of a lion, but his frame was brittle as\r\nglass.\" Between him and John Wesley there was a violent opposition of\r\nopinion, and much acrimonious controversy; but the same fervour and zeal\r\nwhich made him an intemperate theologian gave warmth, richness and\r\nspirituality to his hymns. In some of them, particularly those which,\r\nlike \"Deathless principle, arise,\" are meditations after the German\r\nmanner, and not without direct obligation to German originals, the\r\nsetting is somewhat too artificial; but his art is never inconsistent\r\nwith a genuine flow of real feeling. Others (e.g. \"When languor and\r\ndisease invade\" and \"Your harps, ye trembling saints\") fail to sustain\r\nto the end the beauty with which they began, and would have been better\r\nfor abridgment. But in all these, and in most of his other works, there\r\nis great force and sweetness, both of thought and language, and an easy\r\nand harmonious versification.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Berridge, Williams and R. Hill.\r\n\r\nBerridge, William Williams (1717-1791) and Rowland Hill, all men\r\nremarkable for eccentricity, activity and the devotion of their lives to\r\nthe special work of missionary preaching, though not the authors of many\r\ngood hymns, composed, or adapted from earlier compositions, some of\r\ngreat merit. One of Berridge, adapted from Erskine, has been already\r\nmentioned; another, adapted from Watts, is \"Jesus, cast a look on me.\"\r\nWilliams, a Welshman, who wrote \"Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,\" was\r\nespecially an apostle of Calvinistic Methodism in his own country, and\r\nhis hymns are still much used in the principality. Rowland Hill wrote\r\nthe popular hymn beginning \"Exalted high at God's right hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cowper and Newton.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the number as well as the quality of good hymns available\r\nfor general use is to be regarded, the authors of the _Olney Hymns_ are\r\nentitled to be placed at the head of all the writers of this Calvinistic\r\nschool. The greater number of the _Olney Hymns_ are, no doubt, homely\r\nand didactic; but to the best of them, and they are no inconsiderable\r\nproportion, the tenderness of Cowper and the manliness of John Newton\r\n(1725-1807) give the interest of contrast, as well as that of sustained\r\nreality. If Newton carried to some excess the sound principle laid down\r\nby him, that \"perspicuity, simplicity and ease should be chiefly\r\nattended to, and the imagery and colouring of poetry, if admitted at\r\nall, should be indulged very sparingly and with great judgment,\" if he\r\nis often dry and colloquial, he rises at other times into\r\n\"soul-animating strains,\" such as \"Glorious things of thee are spoken,\r\nZion, city of our God\"; and sometimes (as in \"Approach, my soul, the\r\nmercy seat\") rivals Cowper himself in depth of feeling. Cowper's hymns\r\nin this book are, almost without exception, worthy of his name. Among\r\nthem are \"Hark, my soul, it is the Lord,\" \"There is a fountain filled\r\nwith blood,\" \"Far from the world, O Lord, I flee,\" \"God moves in a\r\nmysterious way\" and \"Sometimes a light surprises.\" Some, perhaps, even\r\nof these, and others of equal excellence (such as \"O for a closer walk\r\nwith God\"), speak the language of a special experience, which, in\r\nCowper's case, was only too real, but which could not, without a degree\r\nof unreality not desirable in exercises of public worship, be applied to\r\nthemselves by all ordinary Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n  19th-century hymns.\r\n\r\n  R. Grant.\r\n\r\n  Bowdler.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the 19th century there were not many\r\nindications of the tendency, which afterwards became manifest, to\r\nenlarge the boundaries of British hymnody. _The Remains of Henry Kirke\r\nWhite_, published by Southey in 1807, contained a series of hymns, some\r\nof which are still in use; and a few of Bishop Heber's hymns and those\r\nof Sir Robert Grant, which, though offending rather too much against\r\nJohn Newton's canon, are well known and popular, appeared between 1811\r\nand 1816, in the _Christian Observer_. In John Bowdler's Remains,\r\npublished soon after his death in 1815, there are a few more of the\r\nsame, perhaps too scholarlike, character. But the chief hymn-writers of\r\nthat period were two clergymen of the Established Church--one in\r\nIreland, Thomas Kelly, and the other in England, William Hurn--who both\r\nbecame Nonconformists, and the Moravian poet, James Montgomery\r\n(1771-1854), a native of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Kelly.\r\n\r\nKelly was the son of an Irish judge, and in 1804 published a small\r\nvolume of ninety-six hymns, which grew in successive editions till, in\r\nthe last before his death in 1854, they amounted to 765. There is, as\r\nmight be expected, in this great number a large preponderance of the\r\ndidactic and commonplace. But not a few very excellent hymns may be\r\ngathered from them. Simple and natural, without the vivacity and\r\nterseness of Watts or the severity of Newton, Kelly has some points in\r\ncommon with both those writers, and he is less subjective than most of\r\nthe \"Methodist\" school. His hymns beginning \"Lo! He comes, let all adore\r\nHim,\" and \"Through the day Thy love hath spared us,\" have a rich,\r\nmelodious movement; and another, \"We sing the praise of Him who died,\"\r\nis distinguished by a calm, subdued power, rising gradually from a\r\nrather low to a very high key.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hurn.\r\n\r\nHurn published in 1813 a volume of 370 hymns, which were afterwards\r\nincreased to 420. There is little in them which deserves to be saved\r\nfrom oblivion; but one at least, \"There is a river deep and broad,\" may\r\nbear comparison with the best of those which have been produced upon the\r\nsame, and it is rather a favourite, theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Montgomery.\r\n\r\nThe _Psalms and Hymns_ of James Montgomery were published in 1822 and\r\n1825, though written earlier. More cultivated and artistic than Kelly,\r\nhe is less simple and natural. His \"Hail to the Lord's Anointed,\" \"Songs\r\nof praise the angels sang\" and \"Mercy alone can meet my case\" are among\r\nhis most successful efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Collections of hymns.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, the collections of miscellaneous hymns for\r\ncongregational use, of which the example was set by the Wesleys,\r\nWhitfield, Toplady and Lady Huntingdon, had greatly multiplied; and with\r\nthem the practice (for which, indeed, too many precedents existed in the\r\nhistory of Latin and German hymnody) of every collector altering the\r\ncompositions of other men without scruple, to suit his own doctrine or\r\ntaste; with the effect, too generally, of patching and disfiguring,\r\nspoiling and emasculating the works so altered, substituting neutral\r\ntints for natural colouring, and a dead for a living sense. In the\r\nChurch of England the use of these collections had become frequent in\r\nchurches and chapels, principally in cities and towns, where the\r\nsentiments of the clergy approximated to those of the Nonconformists. In\r\nrural parishes, when the clergy were not of the \"Evangelical\" school,\r\nthey were generally held in disfavour; for which, even if doctrinal\r\nprepossessions had not entered into the question, the great want of\r\ntaste and judgment often manifested in their compilation, and perhaps\r\nalso the prevailing mediocrity of the bulk of the original compositions\r\nfrom which most of them were derived, would be enough to account. In\r\naddition to this, the idea that no hymns ought to be used in any\r\nservices of the Church of England, except prose anthems after the third\r\ncollect, without express royal or ecclesiastical authority, continued\r\ndown to that time largely to prevail among high churchmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heber, Milman, Keble.\r\n\r\n  Mant.\r\n\r\n  Newman.\r\n\r\nTwo publications, which appeared almost simultaneously in 1827--Bishop\r\nHeber's _Hymns_, with a few added by Dean Milman, and John Keble's\r\n_Christian Year_ (not a hymn-book, but one from which several admirable\r\nhymns have been taken, and the well-spring of many streams of thought\r\nand feeling by which good hymns have since been produced)--introduced a\r\nnew epoch, breaking down the barrier as to hymnody which had till then\r\nexisted between the different theological schools of the Church of\r\nEngland. In this movement Richard Mant, bishop of Down, was also one of\r\nthe first to co-operate. It soon received a great additional impulse\r\nfrom the increased attention which, about the same time, began to be\r\npaid to ancient hymnody, and from the publication in 1833 of Bunsen's\r\n_Gesangbuch_. Among its earliest fruits was the _Lyra apostolica_,\r\ncontaining hymns, sonnets and other devotional poems, most of them\r\noriginally contributed by some of the leading authors of the _Tracts for\r\nthe Times_ to the _British Magazine_; the finest of which is the\r\npathetic \"Lead, kindly Light, amid th' encircling gloom,\" by Cardinal\r\nNewman--well known, and universally admired. From that time hymns and\r\nhymn-writers rapidly multiplied in the Church of England, and in\r\nScotland also. Nearly 600 authors whose publications were later than\r\n1827 are enumerated in Sedgwick's catalogue of 1863, and about half a\r\nmillion hymns are now in existence. Works, critical and historical, upon\r\nthe subject of hymns, have also multiplied; and collections for church\r\nuse have become innumerable--several of the various religious\r\ndenominations, and many of the leading ecclesiastical and religious\r\nsocieties, having issued hymn-books of their own, in addition to those\r\ncompiled for particular dioceses, churches and chapels, and to books\r\n(like _Hymns Ancient and Modern_, published 1861, supplemented 1889,\r\nrevised edition, 1905) which have become popular without any sanction\r\nfrom authority. To mention all the authors of good hymns since the\r\ncommencement of this new epoch would be impossible; but probably no\r\nnames could be chosen more fairly representative of its characteristic\r\nmerits, and perhaps also of some of its defects, than those of Josiah\r\nConder and James Edmeston among English Nonconformists; Henry Francis\r\nLyte and Charlotte Elliott among evangelicals in the Church of England;\r\nJohn Mason Neale and Christopher Wordsworth, bishop of Lincoln, among\r\nEnglish churchmen of the higher school; Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, Edward\r\nH. Plumptre, Frances Ridley Havergal; and in Scotland, Dr Horatius\r\nBonar, Dr Norman Macleod and Dr George Matheson. American hymn-writers\r\nbelong to the same schools, and have been affected by the same\r\ninfluences. Some of them have enjoyed a just reputation on both sides\r\nof the Atlantic. Among those best known are John Greenleaf Whittier,\r\nBishop Doane, Dr W. A. Muhlenberg and Thomas Hastings; and it is\r\ndifficult to praise too highly such works as the Christmas hymn, \"It\r\ncame upon the midnight clear,\" by Edmund H. Sears; the Ascension hymn,\r\n\"Thou, who didst stoop below,\" by Mrs S. E. Miles; two by Dr Ray Palmer,\r\n\"My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary,\" and \"Jesus, Thou joy\r\nof loving hearts,\" the latter of which is the best among several good\r\nEnglish versions of \"Jesu, dulcedo, cordium\"; and \"Lord of all being,\r\nthroned afar,\" by Oliver Wendell Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe more modern \"Moody and Sankey\" hymns (see Moody, D. L.) popularized\r\na new Evangelical type, and the Salvation Army has carried this still\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\n7. _Conclusion._--The object aimed at in this article has been to trace\r\nthe general history of the principal schools of ancient and modern\r\nhymnody, and especially the history of its use in the Christian church.\r\nFor this purpose it has not been thought necessary to give any account\r\nof the hymns of Racine, Madame Guyon and others, who can hardly be\r\nclassed with any school, nor of the works of Caesar Malan of Geneva\r\n(1787-1864) and other quite modern hymn-writers of the Reformed churches\r\nin Switzerland and France.\r\n\r\nOn a general view of the whole subject, hymnody is seen to have been a\r\nnot inconsiderable factor in religious worship. It has been sometimes\r\nemployed to disseminate and popularize particular views, but its spirit\r\nand influence has been, on the whole, catholic. It has embodied the\r\nfaith, trust and hope, and no small part of the inward experience, of\r\ngeneration after generation of men, in many different countries and\r\nclimates, of many different nations, and in many varieties of\r\ncircumstances and condition. Coloured, indeed, by these differences, and\r\nalso by the various modes in which the same truths have been apprehended\r\nby different minds and sometimes reflecting partial and imperfect\r\nconceptions of them, and errors with which they have been associated in\r\nparticular churches, times and places, its testimony is, nevertheless,\r\ngenerally the same. It has upon it a stamp of genuineness which cannot\r\nbe mistaken. It bears witness to the force of a central attraction more\r\npowerful than all causes of difference, which binds together times\r\nancient and modern, nations of various race and language, churchmen and\r\nnonconformists, churches reformed and unreformed; to a true fundamental\r\nunity among good Christians; and to a substantial identity in their\r\nmoral and spiritual experience. (S.)\r\n\r\n  The regular practice of hymnody in English musical history dates from\r\n  the beginning of the 16th century. Luther's verses were adapted\r\n  sometimes to ancient church melodies, sometimes to tunes of secular\r\n  songs, and sometimes had music composed for them by himself and\r\n  others. Many rhyming Latin hymns are of earlier date whose tunes are\r\n  identified with them, some of which tunes, with the subject of their\r\n  Latin text, are among the Reformer's appropriations; but it was he who\r\n  put the words of praise and prayer into the popular mouth, associated\r\n  with rhythmical music which aided to imprint the words upon the memory\r\n  and to enforce their enunciation. In conjunction with his friend\r\n  Johann Walther, Luther issued a collection of poems for choral singing\r\n  in 1524, which was followed by many others in North Germany. The\r\n  English versions of the Psalms by Sternhold and Hopkins and their\r\n  predecessors, and the French version by Clement Marot and Theodore\r\n  Beza, were written with the same purpose of fitting sacred minstrelsy\r\n  to the voice of the multitude. Goudimel in 1566 and Claudin le Jeune\r\n  in 1607 printed harmonizations of tunes that had then become standard\r\n  for the Psalms, and in England several such publications appeared,\r\n  culminating in Thomas Ravenscroft's famous collection, _The Whole Book\r\n  of Psalms_ (1621); in all of these the arrangements of the tunes were\r\n  by various masters. The English practice of hymn-singing was much\r\n  strengthened on the return of the exiled reformers from Frankfort and\r\n  Geneva, when it became so general that, according to Bishop Jewell,\r\n  thousands of the populace who assembled at Paul's Cross to hear the\r\n  preaching would join in the singing of psalms before and after the\r\n  sermon.\r\n\r\n  The placing of the choral song of the church within the lips of the\r\n  people had great religious and moral influence; it has had also its\r\n  great effect upon art, shown in the productions of the North German\r\n  musicians ever since the first days of the Reformation, which abound\r\n  in exercises of scholarship and imagination wrought upon the tunes of\r\n  established acceptance. Some of these are accompaniments to the tunes\r\n  with interludes between the several strains, and some are\r\n  compositions for the organ or for orchestral instruments that consist\r\n  of such elaboration of the themes as is displayed in accompaniments to\r\n  voices, but of far more complicated and extended character. A special\r\n  art-form that was developed to a very high degree, but has passed into\r\n  comparative disuse, was the structure of all varieties of counterpoint\r\n  extemporaneously upon the known hymn-tunes (chorals), and several\r\n  masters acquired great fame by success in its practice, of whom J. A.\r\n  Reinken (1623-1722), Johann Pachelbel (1653-1706), Georg Boehm and the\r\n  great J. S. Bach are specially memorable. The hymnody of North Germany\r\n  has for artistic treatment a strong advantage which is unpossessed by\r\n  that of England, in that for the most part the same verses are\r\n  associated with the same tunes, so that, whenever the text or the\r\n  music is heard, either prompts recollection of the other, whereas in\r\n  England tunes were always and are now often composed to metres and not\r\n  to poems; any tune in a given metre is available for every poem in the\r\n  same, and hence there are various tunes to one poem, and various poems\r\n  to one tune.[4] In England a tune is named generally after some\r\n  place--as \"York,\" \"Windsor,\" \"Dundee,\"--or by some other unsignifying\r\n  word; in North Germany a tune is mostly named by the initial words of\r\n  the verses to which it is allied, and consequently, whenever it is\r\n  heard, whether with words or without, it necessarily suggests to the\r\n  hearer the whole subject of that hymn of which it is the musical\r\n  moiety undivorceable from the literary half. Manifold as they are,\r\n  knowledge of the choral tunes is included in the earliest schooling of\r\n  every Lutheran and every Calvinist in Germany, which thus enables all\r\n  to take part in performance of the tunes, and hence expressly the\r\n  definition of \"choral.\" Compositions grounded on the standard tune are\r\n  then not merely school exercises, but works of art which link the\r\n  sympathies of the writer and the listener, and aim at expressing the\r\n  feeling prompted by the hymn under treatment.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY: I.

But this claim does\r\n    not appear to be substantiated. The editor did not give his readers\r\n    the means of judging as to the real age, character or value of a\r\n    manuscript to which he referred; he did not say that these portions\r\n    of it were in Marvell's handwriting; he did not even himself include\r\n    them among Marvell's poems, as published in the body of his edition;\r\n    and he advanced a like claim on like grounds to two other poems, in\r\n    very different styles, which had been published as their own by\r\n    Tickell and Mallet. It is certain that all the five hymns were first\r\n    made public in 1712, in papers contributed by Addison to the\r\n    _Spectator_ (Nos. 441, 453, 465, 489, 513), in which they were\r\n    introduced in a way which might have been expected if they were by\r\n    the hand which wrote those papers, but which would have been\r\n    improbable, and unworthy of Addison, if they were unpublished works\r\n    of a writer of so much genius, and such note in his day, as Marvell.\r\n    They are all printed as Addison's in Dr Johnson's _British Poets_.\r\n\r\n  [4] The old tune for the 100th Psalm and Croft's tune for the 104th\r\n    are almost the only exceptions, unless \"God save the King\" may be\r\n    classed under \"hymnody.\" In Scotland also the tune for the 124th\r\n    Psalm is associated with its proper text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPAETHROS (Gr. [Greek: hypaithros], beneath the sky, in the open air,\r\n[Greek: hypo], beneath, and [Greek: aithêr], air), the Greek term quoted\r\nby Vitruvius (iii. 2) for the opening in the middle of the roof of\r\ndecastyle temples, of which \"there was no example in Rome, but one in\r\nAthens in the temple of Jupiter Olympius, which is octastyle.\" But at\r\nthe time he wrote (c. 25 B.C.) the cella of this temple was unroofed,\r\nbecause the columns which had been provided to carry, at all events,\r\npart of the ceiling and roof had been taken away by Sulla in 80 B.C. The\r\ndecastyle temple of Apollo Didymaeus near Miletus was, according to\r\nStrabo (c. 50 B.C.), unroofed, on account of the vastness of its cella,\r\nin which precious groves of laurel bushes were planted. Apart from these\r\ntwo examples, the references in various writers to an opening of some\r\nkind in the roofs of temples dedicated to particular deities, and the\r\nstatement of Vitruvius, which was doubtless based on the writings of\r\nGreek authors, that in decastyle or large temples the centre was open to\r\nthe sky and without a roof (_medium autem sub divo est sine tecto_),\r\nrender the existence of the hypaethros probable in some cases; and\r\ntherefore C. R. Cockerell's discovery in the temple at Aegina of two\r\nfragments of a coping-stone, in which there were sinkings on one side to\r\nreceive the tiles and covering tiles, has been of great importance in\r\nthe discussion of this subject. In the conjectural restoration of the\r\nopaion or opening in the roof shown in Cockerell's drawing, it has been\r\nmade needlessly large, having an area of about one quarter of the\r\nsuperficial area of the cella between the columns, and since in the\r\nPantheon at Rome the relative proportions of the central opening in the\r\ndome and the area of the Rotunda are 1: 22, and the light there is\r\nample, in the clearer atmosphere of Greece it might have been less. The\r\nlarger the opening the more conspicuous would be the notch in the roof\r\nwhich is so greatly objected to; in this respect T. J. Hittorff would\r\nseem to be nearer the truth when, in his conjectural restoration of\r\nTemple R. at Selinus, he shows an opaion about half the relative size\r\nshown in Cockerell's of that at Aegina, the coping on the side elevation\r\nbeing much less noticeable. The problem was apparently solved in another\r\nway at Bassae, where, in the excavations of the temple of Apollo by\r\nCockerell and Baron Haller von Hallerstein, three marble tiles were\r\nfound with pierced openings in them about 18 in. by 10 in.; five of\r\nthese pierced tiles on either side would have amply lighted the interior\r\nof the cella, and the amount of rain passing through (a serious element\r\nto be considered in a country where torrential rains occasionally fall)\r\nwould not be very great or more than could be retained to dry up in the\r\ncella sunk pavement. In favour of both these methods of lighting the\r\ninterior of the cella, the sarcophagus tomb at Cyrene, about 20 ft.\r\nlong, carved in imitation of a temple, has been adduced, because, on the\r\ntop of the roof and in its centre, there is a raised coping, and a\r\nsimilar feature is found on a tomb found near Delos; an example from\r\nCrete now in the British Museum shows a pierced tile on each side of\r\nthe roof, and a large number of pierced tiles have been found in\r\nPompeii, some of them surrounded with a rim identical with that of the\r\nmarble tiles at Bassae. On the other hand, there are many authorities,\r\namong them Dr W. Dörpfeld, who have adhered to their original opinion\r\nthat it was only through the open doorway that light was ever admitted\r\ninto the cella, and with the clear atmosphere of Greece and the\r\nreflections from the marble pavement such lighting would be quite\r\nsufficient. There remains still another source of light to be\r\nconsidered, that passing through the Parian marble tiles of the roof;\r\nthe superior translucency of Parian to any other marble may have\r\nsuggested its employment for the roofs of temples, and if, in the framed\r\nceilings carried over the cella, openings were left, some light from the\r\nParian tile roof might have been obtained. It is possibly to this that\r\nPlutarch refers when describing the ceiling and roof of the temple of\r\nDemeter at Eleusis, where the columns in the interior of the temple\r\ncarried a ceiling, probably constructed of timbers crossing one another\r\nat right angles, and one or more of the spaces was left open, which\r\nXenocles surmounted by a roof formed of tiles.\r\n\r\n  James Fergusson put forward many years ago a conjectural restoration\r\n  in which he adopted a clerestory above the superimposed columns inside\r\n  the cella; in order to provide the light for these windows he\r\n  indicated two trenches in the roof, one on each side, and pointed out\r\n  that the great Hall of Columns at Karnak was lighted in this way with\r\n  clerestory windows; but in the first place the light in the latter was\r\n  obtained over the flat roofs covering lower portions of the hall, and\r\n  in the second place, as it rarely rains in Thebes, there could be no\r\n  difficulty about the drainage, while in Greece, with the torrential\r\n  rains and snow, these trenches would be deluged with water, and with\r\n  all the appliances of the present day it would be impossible to keep\r\n  these clerestory windows watertight. There is, however, still another\r\n  objection to Fergusson's theory; the water collecting in these\r\n  trenches on the roof would have to be discharged, for which\r\n  Fergusson's suggestions are quite inadequate, and the gargoyles shown\r\n  in the cella wall would make the peristyle insupportable just at the\r\n  time when it was required for shelter. No drainage otherwise of any\r\n  kind has ever been found in any Greek temple, which is fatal to\r\n  Fergusson's view. Nor is it in accordance with the definition \"open to\r\n  the sky.\" English cathedrals and churches are all lighted by\r\n  clerestory windows, but no one has described them as open to the sky,\r\n  and although Vitruvius's statements are sometimes confusing, his\r\n  description is far too clear to leave any misunderstanding as to the\r\n  lighting of temples (where it was necessary on account of great\r\n  length) through an opening in the roof.\r\n\r\n  There is one other theory which has been put forward, but which can\r\n  only apply to non-peristylar temples,--that light and air was admitted\r\n  through the metopes, the apertures between the beams crossing the\r\n  cella,--and it has been assumed that because Orestes was advised in\r\n  one of the Greek plays to climb up and look through the metopes of the\r\n  temple, these were left open; but if Orestes could look in, so could\r\n  the birds, and the statue of the god would be defiled. The metopes\r\n  were probably filled in with shutters of some kind which Orestes knew\r\n  how to open.     (R. P. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPALLAGE (Gr. [Greek: hypallagê], interchange or exchange), a\r\nrhetorical figure, in which the proper relation between two words\r\naccording to the rules of syntax are inverted. The stock instance is\r\nthat in Virgil, _Aen._ iii. 61, where _dare classibus austros_, to give\r\nwinds to the fleet, is put for _dare classes austris_, to give the fleet\r\nto the winds. The term is also loosely applied to figures of speech\r\nproperly known as \"metonymy\" and, generally, to any striking turn of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPATIA ([Greek: Hypatia]) (c. A.D. 370-415) mathematician and\r\nphilosopher, born in Alexandria, was the daughter of Theon, also a\r\nmathematician and philosopher, author of scholia on Euclid and a\r\ncommentary on the _Almagest_, in which it is suggested that he was\r\nassisted by Hypatia (on the 3rd book). After lecturing in her native\r\ncity, Hypatia ultimately became the recognized head of the Neoplatonic\r\nschool there (c. 400). Her great eloquence and rare modesty and beauty,\r\ncombined with her remarkable intellectual gifts, attracted to her\r\nclass-room a large number of pupils. Among these was Synesius,\r\nafterwards (c. 410) bishop of Ptolemaïs, several of whose letters to\r\nher, full of chivalrous admiration and reverence, are still extant.\r\nSuidas, misled by an incomplete excerpt in Photius from the life of\r\nIsidorus (the Neoplatonist) by Damascius, states that Hypatia was the\r\nwife of Isidorus; but this is chronologically impossible, since Isidorus\r\ncould not have been born before 434 (see Hoche in _Philologus_). Shortly\r\nafter the accession of Cyril to the patriarchate of Alexandria in 412,\r\nowing to her intimacy with Orestes, the pagan prefect of the city,\r\nHypatia was barbarously murdered by the Nitrian monks and the fanatical\r\nChristian mob (March 415). Socrates has related how she was torn from\r\nher chariot, dragged to the Caesareum (then a Christian church),\r\nstripped naked, done to death with oyster-shells ([Greek: ostrakois\r\naneilon,] perhaps \"cut her throat\") and finally burnt piecemeal. Most\r\nprominent among the actual perpetrators of the crime was one Peter, a\r\nreader; but there seems little reason to doubt Cyril's complicity (see\r\nCYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA).\r\n\r\nHypatia, according to Suidas, was the author of commentaries on the\r\n_Arithmetica_ of Diophantus of Alexandria, on the Conics of Apollonius\r\nof Perga and on the astronomical canon (of Ptolemy). These works are\r\nlost; but their titles, combined with expressions in the letters of\r\nSynesius, who consulted her about the construction of an astrolabe and a\r\nhydroscope, indicate that she devoted herself specially to astronomy and\r\nmathematics. Little is known of her philosophical opinions, but she\r\nappears to have embraced the intellectual rather than the mystical side\r\nof Neoplatonism, and to have been a follower of Plotinus rather than of\r\nPorphyry and Iamblichus. Zeller, however, in his _Outlines of Greek\r\nPhilosophy_ (1886, Eng. trans. p. 347), states that \"she appears to have\r\ntaught the Neoplatonic doctrine in the form in which Iamblichus had\r\nstated it.\" A Latin letter to Cyril on behalf of Nestorius, printed in\r\nthe _Collectio nova conciliorum_, i. (1623), by Stephanus Baluzius\r\n(Étienne Baluze, q.v.), and sometimes attributed to her, is undoubtedly\r\nspurious. The story of Hypatia appears in a considerably disguised yet\r\nstill recognizable form in the legend of St Catherine as recorded in the\r\nRoman _Breviary_ (November 25), and still more fully in the\r\n_Martyrologies_ (see A. B. Jameson, _Sacred and Legendary Art_ (1867)\r\nii. 467.)\r\n\r\n  The chief source for the little we know about Hypatia is the account\r\n  given by Socrates (_Hist. ecclesiastica_, vii. 15). She is the subject\r\n  of an epigram by Palladas in the Greek Anthology (ix. 400). See\r\n  Fabricius, _Bibliotheca Graeca_ (ed. Harles), ix. 187; John Toland,\r\n  _Tetradymus_ (1720); R. Hoche in _Philologus_ (1860), xv. 435;\r\n  monographs by Stephan Wolf (Czernowitz, 1879), H. Ligier (Dijon, 1880)\r\n  and W. A. Meyer (Heidelberg, 1885), who devotes attention to the\r\n  relation of Hypatia to the chief representatives of Neoplatonism; J.\r\n  B. Bury, _Hist. of the Later Roman Empire_ (1889), i. 208,317; A.\r\n  Güldenpenning, _Geschichte des oströmischen Reiches unter Arcadius und\r\n  Theodosius II._ (Halle, 1885), p. 230; Wetzer and Welte,\r\n  _Kirchenlexikon_, vi. (1889), from a Catholic standpoint. The story of\r\n  Hypatia also forms the basis of the well-known historical romance by\r\n  Charles Kingsley (1853).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERBATON (Gr. [Greek: huperbaton], a stepping over), the name of a\r\nfigure of speech, consisting of a transposition of words from their\r\nnatural order, such as the placing of the object before instead of after\r\nthe verb. It is a common method of securing emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERBOLA, a conic section, consisting of two open branches, each\r\nextending to infinity. It may be defined in several ways. The _in\r\nsolido_ definition as the section of a cone by a plane at a less\r\ninclination to the axis than the generator brings out the existence of\r\nthe two infinite branches if we imagine the cone to be double and to\r\nextend to infinity. The _in plano_ definition, i.e. as the conic having\r\nan eccentricity greater than unity, is a convenient starting-point for\r\nthe Euclidian investigation. In projective geometry it may be defined as\r\nthe conic which intersects the line at infinity in two real points, or\r\nto which it is possible to draw two real tangents from the centre.\r\nAnalytically, it is defined by an equation of the second degree, of\r\nwhich the highest terms have real roots (see CONIC SECTION).\r\n\r\n  While resembling the parabola in extending to infinity, the curve has\r\n  closest affinities to the ellipse. Thus it has a real centre, two\r\n  foci, two directrices and two vertices; the transverse axis, joining\r\n  the vertices, corresponds to the major axis of the ellipse, and the\r\n  line through the centre and perpendicular to this axis is called the\r\n  conjugate axis, and corresponds to the minor axis of the ellipse;\r\n  about these axes the curve is symmetrical. The curve does not appear\r\n  to intersect the conjugate axis, but the introduction of imaginaries\r\n  permits us to regard it as cutting this axis in two unreal points.\r\n  Calling the foci S, S´, the real vertices A, A´, the extremities of\r\n  the conjugate axis B, B' and the centre C, the positions of B, B´ are\r\n  given by AB = AB´ = CS. If a rectangle be constructed about AA´ and\r\n  BB´, the diagonals of this figure are the \"asymptotes\" of the curve;\r\n  they are the tangents from the centre, and hence touch the curve at\r\n  infinity. These two lines may be pictured in the _in solido_\r\n  definition as the section of a cone by a plane through its vertex and\r\n  parallel to the plane generating the hyperbola. If the asymptotes be\r\n  perpendicular, or, in other words, the principal axes be equal, the\r\n  curve is called the rectangular hyperbola. The hyperbola which has for\r\n  its transverse and conjugate axes the transverse and conjugate axes of\r\n  another hyperbola is said to be the conjugate hyperbola.\r\n\r\n  Some properties of the curve will be briefly stated: If PN be the\r\n  ordinate of the point P on the curve, AA' the vertices, X the meet of\r\n  the directrix and axis and C the centre, then PN²: AN·NA´: : SX²:\r\n  AX·A´X, i.e. PN² is to AN·NA´ in a constant ratio. The circle on AA'\r\n  as diameter is called the auxiliarly circle; obviously AN·NA' equals\r\n  the square of the tangent to this circle from N, and hence the ratio\r\n  of PN to the tangent to the auxiliarly circle from N equals the ratio\r\n  of the conjugate axis to the transverse. We may observe that the\r\n  asymptotes intersect this circle in the same points as the\r\n  directrices. An important property is: the difference of the focal\r\n  distances of any point on the curve equals the transverse axis. The\r\n  tangent at any point bisects the angle between the focal distances of\r\n  the point, and the normal is equally inclined to the focal distances.\r\n  Also the auxiliarly circle is the locus of the feet of the\r\n  perpendiculars from the foci on any tangent. Two tangents from any\r\n  point are equally inclined to the focal distance of the point. If the\r\n  tangent at P meet the conjugate axis in t, and the transverse in N,\r\n  then Ct. PN = BC²; similarly if g and G be the corresponding\r\n  intersections of the normal, PG : Pg : : BC² : AC². A diameter is a\r\n  line through the centre and terminated by the curve: it bisects all\r\n  chords parallel to the tangents at its extremities; the diameter\r\n  parallel to these chords is its conjugate diameter. Any diameter is a\r\n  mean proportional between the transverse axis and the focal chord\r\n  parallel to the diameter. Any line cuts off equal distances between\r\n  the curve and the asymptotes. If the tangent at P meets the asymptotes\r\n  in R, R', then CR·CR´ = CS². The geometry of the rectangular hyperbola\r\n  is simplified by the fact that its principal axes are equal.\r\n\r\n  Analytically the hyperbola is given by ax² + 2hxy + by² + 2gx + 2fy +\r\n  c = 0 wherein ab > h². Referred to the centre this becomes Ax² + 2Hxy\r\n  + By² + C = 0; and if the axes of coordinates be the principal axes of\r\n  the curve, the equation is further simplified to Ax² - By² = C, or if\r\n  the semi-transverse axis be a, and the semi-conjugate b, x²/a² - y²/b²\r\n  = 1. This is the most commonly used form. In the rectangular hyperbola\r\n  a = b; hence its equation is x² - y² = 0. The equations to the\r\n  asymptotes are x/a = ±y/b and x = ±y respectively. Referred to the\r\n  asymptotes as axes the general equation becomes xy = k²; obviously the\r\n  axes are oblique in the general hyperbola and rectangular in the\r\n  rectangular hyperbola. The values of the constant k² are ½(a² + b²)\r\n  and ½a² respectively. (See GEOMETRY: _Analytical_; _Projective_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERBOLE (from Gr. [Greek: hyperballein], to throw beyond), a figure of\r\nrhetoric whereby the speaker expresses more than the truth, in order to\r\nproduce a vivid impression; hence, an exaggeration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERBOREANS ([Greek: Hyperboreoi, Hyperboreioi]), a mythical people\r\nintimately connected with the worship of Apollo. Their name does not\r\noccur in the _Iliad_ or the _Odyssey_, but Herodotus (iv. 32) states\r\nthat they were mentioned in Hesiod and in the _Epigoni_, an epic of the\r\nTheban cycle. According to Herodotus, two maidens, Opis and Arge, and\r\nlater two others, Hyperoche and Laodice, escorted by five men, called by\r\nthe Delians Perphereës, were sent by the Hyperboreans with certain\r\nofferings to Delos. Finding that their messengers did not return, the\r\nHyperboreans adopted the plan of wrapping the offerings in wheat-straw\r\nand requested their neighbours to hand them on to the next nation, and\r\nso on, till they finally reached Delos. The theory of H. L. Ahrens, that\r\nHyperboreans and Perphereës are identical, is now widely accepted. In\r\nsome of the dialects of northern Greece (especially Macedonia and\r\nDelphi) [phi] had a tendency to become [beta]. The original form of\r\n[Greek: Perpherees] was [Greek: hyperpheretai] or [Greek: hyperphoroi]\r\n(\"those who carry over\"), which becoming [Greek: hyperboroi] gave rise\r\nto the popular derivation from [Greek: boreas] (\"dwellers beyond the\r\nnorth wind\"). The Hyperboreans were thus the bearers of the sacrificial\r\ngifts to Apollo over land and sea, irrespective of their home, the name\r\nbeing given to Delphians, Thessalians, Athenians and Delians. It is\r\nobjected by O. Schröder that the form [Greek: Perpherees] requires a\r\npassive meaning, \"those who are carried round the altar,\" perhaps\r\ndancers like the whirling dervishes; distinguishing them from the\r\nHyperboreans, he explains the latter as those who live \"above the\r\nmountains,\" that is, in heaven. Under the influence of the derivation\r\nfrom [Greek: boreas], the home of the Hyperboreans was placed in a\r\nregion beyond the north wind, a paradise like the Elysian plains,\r\ninaccessible by land or sea, whither Apollo could remove those mortals\r\nwho had lived a life of piety. It was a land of perpetual sunshine and\r\ngreat fertility; its inhabitants were free from disease and war. The\r\nduration of their life was 1000 years, but if any desired to shorten it,\r\nhe decked himself with garlands and threw himself from a rock into the\r\nsea. The close connexion of the Hyperboreans with the cult of Apollo may\r\nbe seen by comparing the Hyperborean myths, the characters of which by\r\ntheir names mostly recall Apollo or Artemis (Agyieus, Opis, Hecaergos,\r\nLoxo), with the ceremonial of the Apolline worship. No meat was eaten at\r\nthe Pyanepsia; the Hyperboreans were vegetarians. At the festival of\r\nApollo at Leucas a victim flung himself from a rock into the sea, like\r\nthe Hyperborean who was tired of life. According to an Athenian decree\r\n(380 B.C.) asses were sacrificed to Apollo at Delphi, and Pindar\r\n(_Pythia_, x. 33) speaks of \"hecatombs of asses\" being offered to him by\r\nthe Hyperboreans. As the latter conveyed sacrificial gifts to Delos\r\nhidden in wheat-straw, so at the Thargelia a sheaf of corn was carried\r\nround in procession, concealing a symbol of the god (for other\r\nresemblances see Crusius's article). Although the Hyperborean legends\r\nare mainly connected with Delphi and Delos, traces of them are found in\r\nArgos (the stories of Heracles, Perseus, Io), Attica, Macedonia, Thrace,\r\nSicily and Italy (which Niebuhr indeed considers their original home).\r\nIn modern times the name has been applied to a group of races, which\r\nincludes the Chukchis, Koryaks, Yukaghirs, Ainus, Gilyaks and\r\nKamchadales, inhabiting the arctic regions of Asia and America. But if\r\never ethnically one, the Asiatic and American branches are now as far\r\napart from each other as they both are from the Mongolo-Tatar stock.\r\n\r\n  See O. Crusius in Roscher's _Lexikon der Mythologie_; O. Schröder in\r\n  _Archiv für Religionswissenschaft_ (1904), viii. 69; W. Mannhardt,\r\n  _Wald- und Feldkulte_ (1905); L. R. Farnell, _Cults of the Greek\r\n  States_ (1907), iv. 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPEREIDES (c. 390-322 B.C.), one of the ten Attic orators, was the son\r\nof Glaucippus, of the deme of Collytus. Having studied under Isocrates,\r\nhe began life as a writer of speeches for the courts, and in 360 he\r\nprosecuted Autocles, a general charged with treason in Thrace (frags.\r\n55-65, Blass). At the time of the so-called \"Social War\" (358-355) he\r\naccused Aristophon, then one of the most influential men at Athens, of\r\nmalpractices (frags. 40-44, Blass), and impeached Philocrates (343) for\r\nhigh treason. From the peace of 346 to 324 Hypereides supported\r\nDemosthenes in the struggle against Macedon; but in the affair of\r\nHarpalus he was one of the ten public prosecutors of Demosthenes, and on\r\nthe exile of his former leader he became the head of the patriotic party\r\n(324). After the death of Alexander, he was the chief promoter of the\r\nLamian war against Antipater and Craterus. After the decisive defeat at\r\nCrannon (322), Hypereides and the other orators, whose surrender was\r\ndemanded by Antipater, were condemned to death by the Athenian partisans\r\nof Macedonia. Hypereides fled to Aegina, but Antipater's emissaries\r\ndragged him from the temple of Aeacus, where he had taken refuge, and\r\nput him to death; according to others, he was taken before Antipater at\r\nAthens or Cleonae. His body was afterwards removed to Athens for burial.\r\n\r\nHypereides was an ardent pursuer of \"the beautiful,\" which in his time\r\ngenerally meant pleasure and luxury. His temper was easy-going and\r\nhumorous; and hence, though in his development of the periodic sentence\r\nhe followed Isocrates, the essential tendencies of his style are those\r\nof Lysias, whom he surpassed, however, in the richness of his vocabulary\r\nand in the variety of his powers. His diction was plain and forcible,\r\nthough he occasionally indulged in long compound words probably borrowed\r\nfrom the Middle Comedy, with which, and with the everyday life of his\r\ntime, he was in full sympathy. His composition was simple. He was\r\nspecially distinguished for subtlety of expression, grace and wit, as\r\nwell as for tact in approaching his case and handling his subject\r\nmatter. Sir R. C. Jebb sums up the criticism of pseudo-Longinus (_De\r\nsublimitate_, 34) in the phrase--\"Hypereides was the Sheridan of\r\nAthens.\"\r\n\r\n  Seventy-seven speeches were attributed to Hypereides, of which\r\n  twenty-five were regarded as spurious even by ancient critics. It is\r\n  said that a MS. of most of the speeches was in existence in the 16th\r\n  century in the library of Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, at Ofen,\r\n  but was destroyed at the capture of the city by the Turks in 1526.\r\n  Only a few fragments were known until comparatively recent times. In\r\n  1847 large fragments of his speeches Against _Demosthenes_ (see above)\r\n  and _For Lycophron_ (incidentally interesting as elucidating the order\r\n  of marriage processions and other details of Athenian life, and the\r\n  Athenian government of Lemnos), and the whole of the _For Euxenippus_\r\n  (c. 330, a _locus classicus_ on [Greek: eisangeliai] or state\r\n  prosecutions), were found in a tomb at Thebes in Egypt, and in 1856 a\r\n  considerable portion of a [Greek: logos epitaphios], a _Funeral\r\n  Oration_ over Leosthenes and his comrades who had fallen in the Lamian\r\n  war, the best extant specimen of epideictic oratory (see BABINGTON,\r\n  CHURCHILL). Towards the end of the century further discoveries were\r\n  made of the conclusion of the speech _Against Philippides_ (dealing\r\n  with a [Greek: graphê paranomôn], or indictment for the proposal of an\r\n  unconstitutional measure, arising out of the disputes of the\r\n  Macedonian and anti-Macedonian parties at Athens), and of the whole of\r\n  the _Against Athenogenes_ (a perfumer accused of fraud in the sale of\r\n  his business). These have been edited by F. G. Kenyon (1893). An\r\n  important speech that is lost is the _Deliacus_ (frags. 67-75, Blass)\r\n  on the presidency of the Delian temple claimed by both Athens and\r\n  Delos, which was adjudged by the Amphictyons to Athens.\r\n\r\n  On Hypereides generally see pseudo-Plutarch, _Decem oratorum vitae_;\r\n  F. Blass, _Attische Beredsamkeit_, iii.; R. C. Jebb, _Attic Orators_,\r\n  ii. 381. A full list of editions and articles is given in F. Blass,\r\n  _Hyperidis orationes sex cum ceterarum fragmentis_ (1894, Teubner\r\n  series), to which may be added I. Bassi, _Le Quattro Orazioni di\r\n  Iperide_ (introduction and notes, 1888), and J. E. Sandys in\r\n  _Classical Review_ (January 1895) (a review of the editions of Kenyon\r\n  and Blass). For the discourse against Athenogenes see H. Weil, _Études\r\n  sur l'antiquité grecque_ (1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERION, in Greek mythology, one of the Titans, son of Uranus and Gaea\r\nand father of Helios, the sun-god (Hesiod, _Theog._ 134, 371;\r\nApollodorus i. 1. 2). In the well-known passage in Shakespeare\r\n(_Hamlet_, i. 2: \"Hyperion to a satyr,\" where as in other poets the\r\nvowel -_i_- though really long, is shortened for metrical reasons)\r\nHyperion is used for Apollo as expressive of the idea of beauty. The\r\nname is often used as an epithet of Helios, who is himself sometimes\r\ncalled simply Hyperion. It is explained as (1) he who moves above\r\n([Greek: hyper-iôn]), but the quantity of the vowel is against this; (2)\r\nhe who is above ([Greek: hyperi-ôn]). Others take it to be a patronymic\r\nin form, like [Greek: Kroniôn, Moliôn].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERSTHENE, a rock-forming mineral belonging to the group of\r\northorhombic pyroxenes. It differs from the other members (enstatite\r\n[q.v.] and bronzite) of this group in containing a considerable amount\r\nof iron replacing magnesium: the chemical formula is (Mg, Fe)SiO3.\r\nDistinctly developed crystals are rare, the mineral being usually found\r\nas foliated masses embedded in those igneous rocks--norite,\r\nhypersthene-andesite, &c.--of which it forms an essential constituent.\r\nThe coarsely grained labradorite-hypersthene-rock (norite) of the island\r\nof St Paul off the coast of Labrador has furnished the most typical\r\nmaterial; and for this reason the mineral has been known as \"Labrador\r\nhornblende\" or paulite. The colour is brownish-black, and the pleochrism\r\nstrong; the hardness is 6, and the specific gravity 3.4-3.5. On certain\r\nsurfaces it displays a brilliant copper-red metallic sheen or schiller,\r\nwhich has the same origin as the bronzy sheen of bronzite (q.v.), but is\r\neven more pronounced. Like bronzite, it is sometimes cut and polished\r\nfor ornamental purposes.     (L. J. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERTROPHY (Gr. [Greek: hyper], over, and [Greek: trophê],\r\nnourishment), a term in medicine employed to designate an abnormal\r\nincrease in bulk of one or more of the organs or component tissues of\r\nthe body (see PATHOLOGY). In its strict sense this term can only be\r\napplied where the increase affects the natural textures of a part, and\r\nis not applicable where the enlargement is due to the presence of some\r\nextraneous morbid formation. Hypertrophy of a part may manifest itself\r\neither by simply an increase in the size of its constituents, or by this\r\ncombined with an increase in their number (hyperplasia). In many\r\ninstances both are associated.\r\n\r\nThe conditions giving rise to hypertrophy are the reverse of those\r\ndescribed as producing Atrophy (q.v.). They are concisely stated by Sir\r\nJames Paget as being chiefly or only three, namely: (1) the increased\r\nexercise of a part in its healthy functions; (2) an increased\r\naccumulation in the blood of the particular materials which a part\r\nappropriates to its nutrition or in secretion; and (3) an increased\r\nafflux of healthy blood.\r\n\r\nIllustrations are furnished of the first of these conditions by the high\r\ndevelopment of muscular tissue under habitual active exercise; of the\r\nsecond in the case of obesity, which is an hypertrophy of the fatty\r\ntissues, the elements of which are furnished by the blood; and of the\r\nthird in the occasional overgrowth of hair in the neighbourhood of parts\r\nwhich are the seat of inflammation. Obviously therefore, in many\r\ninstances, hypertrophy cannot be regarded as a deviation from health,\r\nbut rather on the contrary as indicative of a high degree of nutrition\r\nand physical power. Even in those cases where it is found associated\r\nwith disease, it is often produced as a salutary effort of nature to\r\ncompensate for obstructions or other difficulties which have arisen in\r\nthe system, and thus to ward off evil consequences. No better example of\r\nthis can be seen than in the case of certain forms of heart disease,\r\nwhere from defect at some of the natural orifices of that organ the\r\nonward flow of the blood is interfered with, and would soon give rise to\r\nserious embarrassment to the circulation, were it not that behind the\r\nseat of obstruction the heart gradually becomes hypertrophied, and thus\r\nacquires greater propelling power to overcome the resistance in front.\r\nAgain, it has been noticed, in the case of certain double organs such as\r\nthe kidneys, that when one has been destroyed by disease the other has\r\nbecome hypertrophied to such a degree as enables it to discharge the\r\nfunctions of both.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy may, however, in certain circumstances constitute a disease,\r\nas in goitre and elephantiasis (q.v.), and also in the case of certain\r\ntumours and growths (such as cutaneous excrescences, fatty tumours,\r\nmucous polypi, &c.), which are simply enlargements of normal textures.\r\nHypertrophy does not in all cases involve an increase in bulk; for, just\r\nas in atrophy there may be no diminution in the size of the affected\r\norgan, so in hypertrophy there may be no increase. This is apt to be the\r\ncase where certain only of the elements of an organ undergo increase,\r\nwhile the others remain unaffected or are actually atrophied by the\r\npressure of the hypertrophied tissue, as is seen in the disease known as\r\ncirrhosis of the liver.\r\n\r\nA spurious hypertrophy is observed in the rare disease to which G. B.\r\nDuchenne applied the name of _pseudo-hypertrophic paralysis_. This\r\nailment, which appears to be confined to children, consists essentially\r\nof a progressive loss of power accompanied with a remarkable enlargement\r\nof certain muscles or groups of muscles, more rarely of the whole\r\nmuscular system. This increase of bulk is, however, not a true\r\nhypertrophy, but rather an excessive development of connective tissue in\r\nthe substance of the muscles, the proper texture of which tends in\r\nconsequence to undergo atrophy or degeneration. The appearance presented\r\nby a child suffering from this disease is striking. The attitude and\r\ngait are remarkably altered, the child standing with shoulders thrown\r\nback, small of the back deeply curved inwards, and legs wide apart,\r\nwhile walking is accompanied with a peculiar swinging or rocking\r\nmovement. The calves of the legs, the buttocks, the muscles of the back,\r\nand occasionally other muscles, are seen to be unduly enlarged, and\r\ncontrast strangely with the general feebleness. The progress of the\r\ndisease is marked by increasing failure of locomotory power, and\r\nultimately by complete paralysis of the limbs. The malady is little\r\namenable to treatment, and, although often prolonged for years,\r\ngenerally proves fatal before the period of maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPNOTISM, a term now in general use as covering all that pertains to\r\nthe art of inducing the hypnotic state, or hypnosis, and to the study of\r\nthat state, its conditions, peculiarities and effects. Hypnosis is a\r\ncondition, allied to normal sleep (Gr. [Greek: hypnos]), which can be\r\ninduced in a large majority of normal persons. Its most characteristic\r\nand constant symptom is the increased suggestibility of the subject (see\r\nSUGGESTION). Other symptoms are very varied and differ widely in\r\ndifferent subjects and in the same subject at different times. There can\r\nbe no doubt that the increased suggestibility and all the other symptoms\r\nof hypnosis imply some abnormal condition of the brain of a temporary\r\nand harmless nature. It would seem that in all ages and in almost all\r\ncountries individuals have occasionally fallen into abnormal states of\r\nmind more or less closely resembling the hypnotic state, and have\r\nthereby excited the superstitious wonder of their fellows. In some cases\r\nthe state has been deliberately induced, in others it has appeared\r\nspontaneously, generally under the influence of some emotional\r\nexcitement. The most familiar of these allied states is the somnambulism\r\nor sleep-walking to which some persons seem to be hereditarily disposed.\r\nOf a rather different type are the states of ecstasy into which\r\nreligious enthusiasts have occasionally fallen and which were especially\r\nfrequent among the peoples of Europe during the middle ages. While in\r\nthis condition individuals have appeared to be insensitive to all\r\nimpressions made on their sense-organs, even to such as would excite\r\nacute pain in normal persons, have been capable of maintaining rigid\r\npostures for long periods of time, have experienced vivid\r\nhallucinations, and have produced, through the power of the imagination,\r\nextraordinary organic changes in the body, such as the bloody stigmata\r\non the hands and feet in several well-attested instances. It has been\r\nproved in recent years that effects of all these kinds may be produced\r\nby hypnotic suggestion. Different again, but closely paralleled by some\r\nsubjects in hypnosis, is the state of _latah_ into which a certain\r\nproportion of persons of the Malay race are liable to fall. These\r\npersons, if their attention is suddenly and forcibly drawn to any other\r\nperson, will begin to imitate his every action and attitude, and may do\r\nso in spite of their best efforts to restrain their imitative movements.\r\nAmong the half-bred French-Canadians of the forest regions of Canada\r\noccur individuals, known as \"jumpers,\" who are liable to fall suddenly\r\ninto a similar state of abject imitativeness, and the same peculiar\r\nbehaviour has been observed among some of the remote tribes of Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe deliberate induction of states identical with, or closely allied to,\r\nhypnosis is practised by many barbarous and savage peoples, generally\r\nfor ceremonial purposes. Thus, certain dervishes of Algiers are said to\r\ninduce in themselves, by the aid of the sound of drums, monotonous songs\r\nand movements, a state in which they are insensitive to pain, and a\r\nsimilar practice of religious devotees is reported from Tibet. Perhaps\r\nthe most marvellous achievement among well-attested cases of this sort\r\nis that of certain _yogis_ of Hindustan; by long training and practice\r\nthey seem to acquire the power of arresting almost completely all their\r\nvital functions. An intense effort of abstraction from the impressions\r\nof the outer world, a prolonged fixation of the eyes upon the nose or in\r\nsome other strained position and a power of greatly slowing the\r\nrespiration, these seem to be important features of their procedure for\r\nthe attainment of their abnormal states.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the wide distribution in time and space, and the not very\r\ninfrequent occurrence, of these instances of states identical with or\r\nallied to hypnosis, some three centuries of enthusiastic investigation\r\nand of bitter controversy were required to establish the occurrence of\r\nthe hypnotic state among the facts accepted by the world of European\r\nscience. Scientific interest in them may be traced back at least as far\r\nas the end of the 16th century. Paracelsus had founded the \"sympathetic\r\nsystem\" of medicine, according to which the stars and other bodies,\r\nespecially magnets, influence men by means of a subtle emanation or\r\nfluid that pervades all space. J. B. van Helmont, a distinguished man of\r\nscience of the latter part of the 16th century, extended this doctrine\r\nby teaching that a similar magnetic fluid radiates from men, and that it\r\ncan be guided by their wills to influence directly the minds and bodies\r\nof others. In the middle of the 17th century there appeared in England\r\nseveral persons who claimed to have the power of curing diseases by\r\nstroking with the hand. Notable amongst these was Valentine Greatrakes,\r\nof Affane, in the county of Waterford, Ireland, who was born in\r\nFebruary 1628, and who attracted great attention in England by his\r\nsupposed power of curing the king's evil, or scrofula. Many of the most\r\ndistinguished scientific and theological men of the day, such as Robert\r\nBoyle and R. Cudworth, witnessed and attested the cures supposed to be\r\neffected by Greatrakes, and thousands of sufferers crowded to him from\r\nall parts of the kingdom. About the middle of the 18th century John\r\nJoseph Gassner, a Roman Catholic priest in Swabia, took up the notion\r\nthat the majority of diseases arose from demoniacal possession, and\r\ncould only be cured by exorcism. His method was undoubtedly similar to\r\nthat afterwards followed by Mesmer and others, and he had an\r\nextraordinary influence over the nervous systems of his patients.\r\nGassner, however, believed his power to be altogether supernatural.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until the latter part of the 18th century that the\r\ndoctrine of a magnetic fluid excited great popular interest and became\r\nthe subject of fierce controversy in the scientific world. F. A. Mesmer\r\n(q.v.), a physician of Vienna, was largely instrumental in bringing the\r\ndoctrine into prominence. He developed it by postulating a specialized\r\nvariety of magnetic fluid which he called _animal magnetism_; and he\r\nclaimed to be able to cure many diseases by means of this animal\r\nmagnetism, teaching, also, that it may be imparted to and stored up in\r\ninert objects, which are thereby rendered potent to cure disease.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that Mesmer himself was not acquainted with the artificial\r\nsomnambulism which for nearly a century was called mesmeric or magnetic\r\nsleep, and which is now familiar as hypnosis of a well-marked degree. It\r\nwas observed and described about the year 1780 by the marquis de\r\nPuységur, a disciple of Mesmer, who showed that, while subjects were in\r\nthis state, not only could some of their diseases be cured, but also\r\ntheir movements could be controlled by the \"magnetizer,\" and that they\r\nusually remembered nothing of the events of the period of sleep when\r\nrestored to normal consciousness. These are three of the most important\r\nfeatures of hypnosis, and the modern study of hypnotism may therefore be\r\nsaid to have been initiated at this date by Puységur. For, though it is\r\nprobable that this state had often been induced by the earlier\r\nmagnetists, they had not recognized that the peculiar behaviour of their\r\npatients resulted from their being plunged into this artificial sleep,\r\nbut had attributed all the symptoms they observed to the direct physical\r\naction of external agents upon the patients.\r\n\r\nThe success of Mesmer and his disciples, especially great in the\r\nfashionable world, led to the appointment in Paris of a royal commission\r\nfor the investigation of their claims. The commission, which included\r\nmen of great eminence, notably A. L. Lavoisier and Benjamin Franklin,\r\nreported in the year 1784 that it could not accept the evidence for the\r\nexistence of the magnetic fluid; but it did not express an opinion as to\r\nthe reality of the cures said to be effected by its means, nor as to the\r\nnature of the magnetic sleep. This report and the social upheavals of\r\nthe following years seem to have abolished the public interest in\r\n\"animal magnetism\" for the space of one generation; after which\r\nAlexandre Bertrand, a Parisian physician, revived it by his acute\r\ninvestigations and interpretations of the phenomena. Bertrand was the\r\nfirst to give an explanation of the facts of the kind that is now\r\ngenerally accepted. He exhibited the affinity of the \"magnetic sleep\" to\r\nordinary somnambulism, and he taught that the peculiar effects are to be\r\nregarded as due to the suggestions of the operator working themselves\r\nout in the mind and body of the \"magnetized\" subject, i.e. he regarded\r\nthe influence of the magnetizer as exerted in the first instance on the\r\nmind of the subject and only indirectly through the mind upon the body.\r\nShortly after this revival of public interest, namely in the year 1831,\r\na committee of the Academy of Medicine of Paris reported favourably upon\r\n\"magnetism\" as a therapeutic agency, and before many years had elapsed\r\nit was extensively practised by the physicians of all European\r\ncountries, with few exceptions, of which England was the most notable.\r\nMost of the practitioners of this period adhered to the doctrine of the\r\nmagnetic fluid emanating from the operator to his patient, and the\r\nacceptance of this doctrine was commonly combined with belief in\r\nphrenology, astrology and the influence of metals and magnets,\r\nexternally applied, in curing disease and in producing a variety of\r\nstrange sensations and other affections of the mind. These beliefs,\r\nclaiming to rest upon carefully observed facts, were given a new\r\nelaboration and a more imposing claim to be scientifically established\r\nby the doctrine of _odylic force_ propounded by Baron Karl von\r\nReichenbach. In this mass of ill-based assertion and belief the valuable\r\ntruths of \"animal magnetism\" and the psychological explanations of them\r\ngiven by Bertrand were swamped and well-nigh lost sight of. For it was\r\nthis seemingly inseparable association between the facts of hypnotism\r\nand these bizarre practices and baseless beliefs that blinded the larger\r\nand more sober part of the scientific world, and led them persistently\r\nto assert that all this group of alleged phenomena was a mass of\r\nquackery, fraud and superstition. And the fact that magnetism was\r\npractised for pecuniary gain, often in a shameless manner, by exponents\r\nwho claimed to cure by its means every conceivable ill, rendered this\r\nattitude on the part of the medical profession inevitable and perhaps\r\nexcusable, though not justifiable. It was owing to this baleful\r\nassociation that John Elliotson, one of the leading London physicians of\r\nthat time, who became an ardent advocate of \"magnetism\" and who founded\r\nand edited the _Zoist_ in the interests of the subject, was driven out\r\nof the profession. This association may perhaps be held, also, to excuse\r\nthe hostile attitude of the medical profession towards James Esdaile, a\r\nsurgeon, who, practising in a government hospital in Calcutta among the\r\nnatives of India, performed many major operations, such as the\r\namputation of limbs, painlessly and with the most excellent results by\r\naid of the \"magnetic\" sleep. For both Elliotson and Esdaile, though\r\nhonourable practitioners, accepted the doctrine of the \"magnetic\" fluid\r\nand many of the erroneous beliefs that commonly were bound up with it.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 James Braid, a surgeon of Manchester, rediscovered independently\r\nBertrand's physiological and psychological explanations of the facts,\r\ncarried them further, and placed \"hypnotism,\" as he named the study, on\r\na sound basis. Braid showed that subjects in \"magnetic\" sleep, far from\r\nbeing in a profoundly insensitive condition, are often abnormally\r\nsusceptible to impressions on the senses, and showed that many of the\r\npeculiarities of their behaviour were due to suggestions, made verbally\r\nor otherwise, but unintentionally, by the operator or by onlookers.\r\n\r\nIt seems, on looking back on the history of hypnotism, that at this time\r\nit was in a fair way to secure general recognition as a most interesting\r\nsubject of psychological study and a valuable addition to the resources\r\nof the physician. But it was destined once more to be denied its rights\r\nby official science and to fall back into disrepute. This was due to the\r\ncoincidence about the year 1848 of two events of some importance,\r\nnamely--the discovery of the anaesthetic properties of chloroform and\r\nthe sudden rise of modern spiritualism. The former afforded a very\r\nconvenient substitute for the most obvious practical application of\r\nhypnotism, the production of anaesthesia during surgical operations; the\r\nlatter involved it once more in a mass of fraud and superstition, and,\r\nfor the popular mind, drove it back to the region of the marvellous, the\r\nsupernatural and the dangerous, made it, in fact, once more a branch of\r\nthe black art.\r\n\r\nFrom this time onward there took place a gradual differentiation of the\r\n\"animal magnetism\" of the 18th century into two diverging branches,\r\nhypnotism and spiritualism, two branches which, however, are not yet\r\nentirely separated and, perhaps, never will be. At the same time the\r\noriginal system of \"animal magnetism\" has lived on in an enfeebled\r\ncondition and is now very nearly, though not quite, extinct.\r\n\r\nIn the development of hypnotism since the time of Braid we may\r\ndistinguish three lines, the physiological, the psychological and the\r\npathological. The last may be dismissed in a few words. Its principal\r\nrepresentative was J. M. Charcot, who taught at the Salpêtrière in Paris\r\nthat hypnosis is essentially a symptom of a morbid condition of hysteria\r\nor hystero-epilepsy. This doctrine, which, owing to the great repute\r\nenjoyed by Charcot, has done much to retard the application of\r\nhypnotism, is now completely discredited. The workers of the\r\nphysiological party attached special importance to the fixation of the\r\neyes, or to other forms of long continued and monotonous, or violent,\r\nsensory stimulation in the induction of hypnosis. They believed that by\r\nacting on the senses in these ways they induced a peculiar condition of\r\nthe nervous system, which consisted in the temporary abolition of the\r\ncerebral functions and the consequent reduction of the subject to\r\nmachine-like unconscious automatism. The leading exponent of this view\r\nwas R. Heidenhain, professor of physiology at Breslau, whose\r\nexperimental investigations played a large part in convincing the\r\nscientific world of the genuineness of the leading symptoms of hypnosis.\r\nThe purely psychological doctrine of hypnosis puts aside all physical\r\nand physiological influences and effects as of but little or no\r\nimportance, and seeks a psychological explanation of the induction of\r\nhypnosis and of all the phenomena. This dates from 1884, when H.\r\nBernheim, professor of medicine at Nancy, published his work _De la\r\nSuggestion_ (republished in 1887 with a second part on the therapeutics\r\nof hypnotism). Bernheim was led to the study of hypnotism by A. A.\r\nLiébeault, who for twenty years had used it very largely and\r\nsuccessfully in his general practice among the poor of Nancy. Liébeault\r\nrediscovered independently, and Bernheim made known to the world the\r\ntruths, twice previously discovered and twice lost sight of, that\r\nexpectation is a most important factor in the induction of hypnosis,\r\nthat increased suggestibility is its essential symptom, and that in\r\ngeneral the operator works upon his patient by mental influences.\r\nAlthough they went too far in the direction of ignoring the peculiarity\r\nof the state of the brain in hypnosis and the predisposing effect of\r\nmonotonous sensory stimulation, and in seeking to identify hypnosis with\r\nnormal sleep, the views of the Nancy investigators have prevailed, and\r\nare now in the main generally accepted. Their methods of verbal\r\nsuggestion have been adopted by leading physicians in almost all\r\ncivilized countries and have been proved to be efficacious in the relief\r\nof many disorders; and as a method of psychological investigation\r\nhypnotism has proved, especially in the hands of the late Ed. Gurney, of\r\nDr Pierre Janet and of other investigators, capable of throwing much\r\nlight on the constitution of the mind, has opened up a number of\r\nproblems of the deepest interest, and has done more than any other of\r\nthe many branches of modern psychology to show the limitations and\r\ncomparative barrenness of the old psychology that relied on\r\nintrospection alone and figured as a department of general philosophy.\r\nIn England, \"always the last to enter into the general movement of the\r\nEuropean mind,\" the prejudice, incredulity and ignorant\r\nmisrepresentation with which hypnotism has everywhere been received have\r\nresisted its progress more stubbornly than elsewhere; but even in\r\nEngland its reality and its value as a therapeutic agent have at last\r\nbeen officially recognized. In 1892, just fifty years after Braid\r\nclearly demonstrated the facts and published explanations of them almost\r\nidentical with those now accepted, a committee of the British Medical\r\nAssociation reported favourably upon hypnotism after a searching\r\ninvestigation; it is now regularly employed by a number of physicians of\r\nhigh standing, and the formation in 1907 of \"The Medical Society for the\r\nStudy of Suggestive Therapeutics\" shows that the footing it has gained\r\nis likely to be made good.\r\n\r\n_Induction of Hypnosis._--It has now been abundantly proved that\r\nhypnosis can be induced in the great majority of normal persons,\r\nprovided that they willingly submit themselves to the process. Several\r\nof the most experienced operators have succeeded in hypnotizing more\r\nthan 90% of the cases they have attempted, and most of them are agreed\r\nthat failure to induce hypnosis in any case is due either to lack of\r\nskill and tact on the part of the operator, or to some unfavourable\r\nmental condition of the subject. It has often been said that some races\r\nor peoples are by nature more readily hypnotizable than others; of the\r\nFrench people especially this has been maintained. But there is no\r\nsufficient ground for this statement. The differences that undoubtedly\r\nobtain between populations of different regions in respect to the ease\r\nor difficulty with which a large proportion of all persons can be\r\nhypnotized are sufficiently explained by the differences of the attitude\r\nof the public towards hypnotism; in France, e.g., and especially in\r\nNancy, hypnotism has been made known to the public chiefly as a\r\nrecognized auxiliary to the better known methods of medical treatment,\r\nwhereas in England the medical profession has allowed the public to make\r\nacquaintance with hypnotism through the medium of disgusting\r\nstage-performances whose only object was to raise a laugh, and has, with\r\nfew exceptions, joined in the general chorus of condemnation and\r\nmistrust. Hence in France patients submit themselves with confidence and\r\ngoodwill to hypnotic treatment, whereas in England it is still necessary\r\nin most cases to remove an ill-based prejudice before the treatment can\r\nbe undertaken with hope of success. For the confidence and goodwill of\r\nthe patient are almost essential to success, and even after hypnosis has\r\nbeen induced on several occasions a patient may be so influenced by\r\ninjudicious friends that he cannot again be hypnotized or, if\r\nhypnotized, is much less amenable to the power of suggestion. Various\r\nmethods of hypnotization are current, but most practitioners combine the\r\nmethods of Braid and of Bernheim. After asking the patient to resign\r\nhimself passively into their hands, and after seating him in a\r\ncomfortable arm-chair, they direct him to fix his eyes upon some small\r\nobject held generally in such a position that some slight muscular\r\nstrain is involved in maintaining the fixation; they then suggest to him\r\nverbally the idea or expectation of sleep and the sensations that\r\nnormally accompany the oncoming of sleep, the heaviness of the eyes, the\r\nslackness of the limbs and so forth; and when the eyes show signs of\r\nfatigue, they either close them by gentle pressure or tell the subject\r\nto close them. Many also pass their hands slowly and regularly over the\r\nface, with or without contact. The old magnetizers attached great\r\nimportance to such \"passes,\" believing that by them the \"magnetic fluid\"\r\nwas imparted to the patient; but it seems clear that, in so far as they\r\ncontribute to induce hypnosis, it is in their character merely of\r\ngentle, monotonous, sensory stimulations. A well-disposed subject soon\r\nfalls into a drowsy state and tends to pass into natural sleep; but by\r\nspeech, by passes, or by manipulating his limbs the operator keeps in\r\ntouch with him, keeps his waning attention open to the impressions he\r\nhimself makes. Most subjects then find it difficult or impossible to\r\nopen their eyes or to make any other movement which is forbidden or said\r\nto be impossible by the operator, although they may be fully conscious\r\nof all that goes on about them and may have the conviction that if they\r\ndid but make an effort they could break the spell. This is a light stage\r\nof hypnosis beyond which some subjects can hardly be induced to pass and\r\nbeyond which few pass at the first attempt. But on successive occasions,\r\nor even on the first occasion, a favourable subject passes into deeper\r\nstages of hypnosis. Many attempts have been made to distinguish clearly\r\nmarked and constantly occurring stages. But it seems now clear that the\r\ncomplex of symptoms displayed varies in all cases with the\r\nidiosyncrasies of the subject and with the methods adopted by the\r\noperator. In many subjects a waxy rigidity of the limbs appears\r\nspontaneously or can be induced by suggestion; the limbs then retain for\r\nlong periods without fatigue any position given them by the operator.\r\nThe most susceptible subjects pass into the stage known as artificial\r\nsomnambulism. In this condition they continue to respond to all\r\nsuggestions made by the operator, but seem as insensitive to all other\r\nimpressions as a person in profound sleep or in coma; and on awaking\r\nfrom this condition they are usually oblivious of all that they have\r\nheard, said or done during the somnambulistic period. When in this last\r\ncondition patients are usually more profoundly influenced by\r\nsuggestions, especially post-hypnotic suggestions, than when in the\r\nlighter stages; but the lighter stages suffice for the production of\r\nmany therapeutic effects. When a patient is completely hypnotized, his\r\nmovements, his senses, his ideas and, to some extent, even the organic\r\nprocesses over which he has no voluntary control become more or less\r\ncompletely subject to the suggestions of the operator; and usually he is\r\nresponsive to the operator alone (_rapport_) unless he is instructed by\r\nthe latter to respond also to the suggestions of other persons. If left\r\nto himself the hypnotized subject will usually awake to his normal state\r\nafter a period which is longer in proportion to the depth of hypnosis;\r\nand the deeper stages seem to pass over into normal sleep. The subject\r\ncan in almost every case be brought quickly back to the normal state by\r\nthe verbal command of the operator.\r\n\r\n_The Principal Effects produced by Suggestion during Hypnosis._--The\r\nsubject may not only be rendered incapable of contracting any of the\r\nmuscles of the voluntary system, but may also be made to use them with\r\nextraordinarily great or sustained force (though by no means in all\r\ncases). He can with difficulty refrain from performing any action\r\ncommanded by the operator, and usually carries out any simple command\r\nwithout hesitation. Any one of the sense-organs, or any sensory region\r\nsuch as the skin or deep tissues of one limb may be rendered anaesthetic\r\nby verbal suggestion, aided perhaps by some gentle manipulation of the\r\npart. On this fact depends the surgical application of hypnotism.\r\nSceptical observers are always inclined to doubt the genuineness of the\r\nanaesthesia produced by a mere word of command, but the number of\r\nsurgical operations performed under hypnotic anaesthesia suffices to put\r\nits reality beyond all question. A convincing experiment may, however,\r\nbe made on almost any good subject. Anaesthesia of one eye may be\r\nsuggested and its reality tested in the following way. Anaesthesia of\r\nthe left eye may be suggested, and the subject be instructed to fix his\r\ngaze on a distant point and to give some signal as soon as he sees the\r\noperator's finger in the peripheral field of view. The operator then\r\nbrings his finger slowly from behind and to the right forwards towards\r\nthe subject's line of sight. The subject signals as soon as it crosses\r\nthe normal temporal boundary of the field of view of the right eye. The\r\noperator then brings his finger forward from a point behind and to the\r\nleft of the subject's head. The subject allows it to cross the monocular\r\nfield of the left eye and signals only when the finger enters the field\r\nof vision of the right eye across its nasal boundary. Since few persons,\r\nother than physiologists or medical men, are aware of the relations of\r\nthe boundaries of the monocular and binocular fields of vision, the\r\nsuccess of this experiment affords proof that the finger remains\r\ninvisible to the subject during its passage across the monocular field\r\nof the left eye. The abolition of pain, especially of neuralgias, the\r\npain of rheumatic and other inflammations, which is one of the most\r\nvaluable applications of hypnotism, is an effect closely allied to the\r\nproduction of such anaesthesia.\r\n\r\nIt has often been stated that in hypnosis the senses may be rendered\r\nextraordinarily acute or hyperaesthetic, so that impressions too faint\r\nto affect the senses of the normal person may be perceived by the\r\nhypnotized subject; but in view of the fact that most observers are\r\nignorant of the normal limits of sensitivity and discrimination, all\r\nsuch statements must be received with caution, until we have more\r\nconvincing evidence than has yet been brought forward.\r\n\r\n_Positive and Negative Hallucinations_ are among the most striking\r\neffects of hypnotic suggestion. A good subject may be made to experience\r\nan hallucinatory perception of almost any object, the more easily the\r\nless unusual and out of harmony with the surroundings is the suggested\r\nobject. He may, e.g., be given a blank card and asked if he thinks it a\r\ngood photograph of himself. He may then assent and describe the\r\nphotograph in some detail, and, what is more astonishing, he may pick\r\nout the card as the one bearing the photograph, after it has been mixed\r\nwith other similar blank cards. This seems to be due to the part played\r\nby _points de repère_, insignificant details of surface or texture,\r\nwhich serve as an objective basis around which the hallucinatory image\r\nis constructed by the pictorial imagination of the subject. A negative\r\nhallucination may be induced by telling the subject that a certain\r\nobject or person is no longer present, when he ignores in every way that\r\nobject or person. This is more puzzling than the positive hallucination\r\nand will be referred to again in discussing the theory of hypnosis. Both\r\nkinds of hallucination tend to be systematically and logically\r\ndeveloped; if, e.g., the subject is told that a certain person is no\r\nlonger visible, he may become insensitive to impressions made on any\r\nsense by that person.\r\n\r\n_Delusions_, or false beliefs as to their present situation or past\r\nexperiences may be induced in many subjects. On being assured that he is\r\nsome other person, or that he is in some strange situation, the subject\r\nmay accept the suggestion and adapt his behaviour with great histrionic\r\nskill to the induced delusion. It is probable that many, perhaps all,\r\nsubjects are vaguely aware, as we sometimes are in dreams, that the\r\ndelusions and hallucinations they experience are of an unreal nature. In\r\nthe lighter stages of hypnosis a subject usually remembers the events of\r\nhis waking life, but in the deeper stages he is apt, while remembering\r\nthe events of previous hypnotic periods, to be incapable of recalling\r\nhis normal life; but in this respect, as also in respect to the extent\r\nto which on awaking he remembers the events of the hypnotic period, the\r\nsuggestions of the operator usually play a determining part.\r\n\r\nAmong the organic changes that have been produced by hypnotic suggestion\r\nare slowing or acceleration of the cardiac and respiratory rhythms; rise\r\nand fall of body-temperature through two or three degrees; local\r\nerythema and even inflammation of the skin with vesication or exudation\r\nof small drops of blood; evacuation of the bowel and vomiting;\r\nmodifications of the secretory activity of glands, especially of the\r\nsweat-glands.\r\n\r\n_Post-hypnotic Effects._--Most subjects in whom any appreciable degree\r\nof hypnosis can be induced show some susceptibility to post-hypnotic\r\nsuggestion, i.e. they may continue to be influenced, when restored to\r\nthe fully waking state, by suggestions made during hypnosis, more\r\nespecially if the operator suggests that this shall be the case; as a\r\nrule, the deeper the stage of hypnosis reached, the more effective are\r\npost-hypnotic suggestions. The therapeutic applications of hypnotism\r\ndepend in the main upon this post-hypnotic continuance of the working of\r\nsuggestions. If a subject is told that on awaking, or on a certain\r\nsignal, or after the lapse of a given interval of time from the moment\r\nof awaking, he will perform a certain action, he usually feels some\r\ninclination to carry out the suggestion at the appropriate moment. If he\r\nremembers that the action has been suggested to him he may refuse to\r\nperform it, and if it is one repugnant to his moral nature, or merely\r\none that would make him appear ridiculous, he may persist in his\r\nrefusal. But if the action is of a simple and ordinary nature he will\r\nusually perform it, remarking that he cannot be comfortable till it is\r\ndone. If the subject was deeply hypnotized and remembers nothing of the\r\nhypnotic period, he will carry out the post-hypnotic suggestion in\r\nalmost every case, no matter how complicated or absurd it may be, so\r\nlong as it is not one from which his normal self would be extremely\r\naverse; and he will respond appropriately to the suggested signals,\r\nalthough he is not conscious of their having been named; he will often\r\nperform the action in a very natural way, and will, if questioned, give\r\nsome more or less adequate reason for it. Such actions, determined by\r\npost-hypnotic suggestions of which no conscious memory remains, may be\r\ncarried out even after the lapse of many weeks or even months.\r\nInhibitions of movement, anaesthesia, positive and negative\r\nhallucinations, and delusions may also be made to persist for brief\r\nperiods after the termination of hypnosis; and organic effects, such as\r\nthe action of the bowels, the oncoming of sleep and the cessation of\r\npain, may be determined by post-hypnotic suggestion. In short, it may be\r\nsaid that in a good subject all the kinds of suggestion which will take\r\neffect during hypnosis will also be effective if given as post-hypnotic\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n_Theory of the Hypnotic State._--Very many so called theories of\r\nhypnosis have been propounded, but few of them demand serious\r\nconsideration. One author ascribes all the symptoms to cerebral anaemia,\r\nanother to cerebral congestion, a third to temporary suppression of the\r\nfunctions of the cerebrum, a fourth to abnormal cerebral excitability, a\r\nfifth to the independent functioning of one hemisphere. Another seeks to\r\nexplain all the facts by saying that in hypnosis our normal\r\nconsciousness disappears and is replaced by a dream-consciousness; and\r\nyet another by the assumption that every human organism comprises two\r\nmental selves or personalities, a normal one and one which only comes\r\ninto activity during sleep and hypnosis. Most of these \"theories\" would,\r\neven if true, carry us but a little way towards a complete understanding\r\nof the facts. There is, however, one theory or principle of explanation\r\nwhich is now gradually taking shape under the hands of a number of the\r\nmore penetrating workers in this field, and which does seem to render\r\nintelligible many of the principle facts. This is the theory of _mental\r\ndissociation_.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that a theory of hypnosis must attempt to give some account\r\nof the peculiar condition of the brain which is undoubtedly present as\r\nan essential feature of the state. It is therefore not enough to say\r\nwith Bernheim that hypnosis is a state of abnormally increased\r\nsuggestibility produced by suggestion; nor is it enough, though it is\r\npartially true, to say that it is a state of mono-ideism or one of\r\nabnormally great concentration of attention. Any theory must be stated\r\nin terms of physiological psychology, it must take account of both the\r\npsychical and the nervous peculiarities of the hypnotic state; it must\r\nexhibit the physiological condition as in some degree similar to that\r\nobtaining in normal sleep; but principally it must account for that\r\nabnormally great receptivity for ideas, and that abnormally intense and\r\neffective operation of ideas so received, which constitute abnormally\r\ngreat suggestibility.\r\n\r\nThe theory of mental dissociation may be stated in purely mental terms,\r\nor primarily in terms of nervous structure and function, and the latter\r\nmode of statement is probably the more profitable at the present time.\r\nThe increased effectiveness of ideas might be due to one of two\r\nconditions: (1) it might be that certain tracts of the brain or the\r\nwhole brain were in a condition of abnormally great excitability; or (2)\r\nan idea might operate more effectively in the mind and on the body, not\r\nbecause it, or the underlying brain-process was more intense than\r\nnormally, but because it worked out its effects free from the\r\ninterference of contrary or irrelevant ideas that might weaken its\r\nforce. It is along this second line that the theory of mental\r\ndissociation attempts to explain the increased suggestibility of\r\nhypnosis. To understand the theory we must bear in mind the nature of\r\nmental process in general and of its nervous concomitants. Mental\r\nprocess consists in the interplay, not merely of ideas, but rather of\r\ncomplex dispositions which are the more or less enduring conditions of\r\nthe rise of ideas to consciousness. Each such disposition seems capable\r\nof remaining inactive or quiescent for long periods, and of being\r\nexcited in various degrees, either by impressions made upon the\r\nsense-organs or by the spread of excitement from other dispositions.\r\nWhen its excitement rises above a certain pitch of intensity, the\r\ncorresponding idea rises to the focus of consciousness. These\r\ndispositions are essential factors of all mental process, the essential\r\nconditions of all mental retention. They may be called simply mental\r\ndispositions, their nature being left undefined; but for our present\r\npurpose it is advantageous to regard them as neural dispositions,\r\ncomplex functional groups of nervous elements or neurones. The neurones\r\nof each such group must be conceived as being so intimately connected\r\nwith one another that the excitement of any part of the group at once\r\nspreads through the whole group or disposition, so that it always\r\nfunctions as a unit. The whole cerebrum must be conceived as consisting\r\nof a great number of such dispositions, inextricably interwoven, but\r\ninterconnected in orderly fashion with very various degrees of intimacy;\r\ngroups of dispositions are very intimately connected to form neural\r\nsystems, so that the excitement of any one member of such a system tends\r\nto spread in succession to all the other members. On the other hand, it\r\nis a peculiarity of the reciprocal relations of all such dispositions\r\nand systems that the excitement of any one to such a degree that the\r\ncorresponding idea rises to consciousness prevents or inhibits the\r\nexcitement of others, i.e. all of them are in relations of reciprocal\r\ninhibition with one another (see MUSCLE AND NERVE). The excitement of\r\ndispositions associated together to form a system tends towards some end\r\nwhich, either immediately or remotely, is an action, a bodily movement,\r\nin many cases a movement of the organs of speech only. Now we know from\r\nmany exact experiments that the neural dispositions act and react upon\r\none another to some extent, even when they are excited only in so feeble\r\na degree that the corresponding ideas do not rise to consciousness. In\r\nthe normal state of the brain, then, when any idea is present to\r\nconsciousness, the corresponding neural disposition is in a state of\r\ndominant excitement, but the intensity of that excitement is moderated,\r\ndepressed or partially inhibited by the sub-excitement of many rival or\r\ncompeting dispositions of other systems with which it is connected.\r\nSuppose now that all the nervous connexions between the multitudinous\r\ndispositions of the cerebrum are by some means rendered less effective,\r\nthat the association-paths are partially blocked or functionally\r\ndepressed; the result will be that, while the most intimate connexions,\r\nthose between dispositions of any one system remain functional or\r\npermeable, the weaker less intimate connexions, those between\r\ndispositions belonging to different systems will be practically\r\nabolished for the time being; each system of dispositions will then\r\nfunction more or less as an isolated system, and its activity will no\r\nlonger be subject to the depressing or inhibiting influence of other\r\nsystems; therefore each system, on being excited in any way, will tend\r\nto its end with more than normal force, being freed from all\r\ninterferences; that is to say, each idea or system of ideas will tend to\r\nwork itself out and to realize itself in action immediately, without\r\nsuffering the opposition of antagonistic ideas which, in the normal\r\nstate of the brain, might altogether prevent its realization in action.\r\n\r\nThe theory of mental dissociation assumes that the abnormal state of the\r\nbrain that obtains during hypnosis is of this kind, a temporary\r\nfunctional depression of all, or of many of the associations or nervous\r\nlinks between the neural dispositions; that is, it regards hypnosis as a\r\nstate of _relative dissociation_. The lighter the stage of hypnosis the\r\nslighter is the degree of dissociation, the deeper the stage the more\r\nnearly complete is the dissociation.\r\n\r\nIt is not essential that the theory should explain in what change this\r\nstage of dissociation consists, but a view compatible with all that we\r\nknow of the functions of the central nervous system may be suggested.\r\nThe connexions between neural dispositions involve synapses or\r\ncell-junctions, and these seem to be the places of variable resistance\r\nwhich demarcate the dispositions and systems; and there is good reason\r\nto think that their resistances vary with the state of the neurones\r\nwhich they connect, being lowered when these are excited and raised when\r\ntheir excitement ebbs. Now, in the waking state, the varied stimuli,\r\nwhich constantly rain upon all the sense-organs, maintain the whole\r\ncerebrum in a state of sub-excitement, keep all the cerebral neurones\r\npartially charged with free nervous energy. When the subject lies down\r\nto sleep or submits himself to the hypnotizer he arrests as far as\r\npossible the flow of his thoughts, and the sensory stimuli are\r\ndiminished in number and intensity. Under these conditions the general\r\ncerebral activity tends to subside, the free energy with which the\r\ncerebral neurones are charged ebbs away, and the synaptic resistances\r\nrise proportionally; then the effect of sensory impressions tends to be\r\nconfined to the lower nervous level, and the brain tends to come to\r\nrest. If this takes place the condition of normal sleep is realized. But\r\nin inducing hypnosis the operator, by means of his words and\r\nmanipulations, keeps one system of ideas and the corresponding neural\r\nsystem in activity, namely, the ideas connected with himself; thus he\r\nkeeps open one channel of entry to the brain and mind, and through this\r\none open channel he can introduce whatever ideas he pleases; and the\r\nideas so introduced then operate with abnormally great effect because\r\nthey work in a free field, unchecked by rival ideas and tendencies.\r\n\r\nThis theory of relative dissociation has two great merits: in the first\r\nplace it goes far towards enabling us to understand in some degree most\r\nof the phenomena of hypnosis; secondly, we have good evidence that\r\ndissociation really occurs in deep hypnosis and in some allied states.\r\nAny one may readily work out for himself the application of the theory\r\nto the explanation of the power of the operator's suggestions to control\r\nmovement, to induce anaesthesia, hallucinations and delusions, and to\r\nexert on the organic processes an influence greater than can be exerted\r\nby mental processes in the normal state of the brain. But the positive\r\nevidence of the occurrence of dissociation is a matter of great\r\npsychological interest and its nature must be briefly indicated. The\r\nphenomena of automatic speech and writing afford the best evidence of\r\ncerebral dissociation. Many persons can, while in an apparently normal\r\nor but very slightly abnormal condition, produce automatic writing, i.e.\r\nintelligibly written sentences, in some cases long connected passages,\r\nof whose import they have no knowledge, their self-conscious\r\nintelligence being continuously directed to some other task. The\r\ncarrying out of post-hypnotic suggestions affords in many cases similar\r\nevidence. Thus a subject may be told that after waking he will perform\r\nsome action when a given signal, such as a cough, is repeated for the\r\nfifth time. In the post-hypnotic state he remains unaware of his\r\ninstructions, is not conscious of noting the signals, and yet carries\r\nout the suggestion at the fifth signal, thereby proving that the signals\r\nhave been in some sense noted and counted. Many interesting varieties of\r\nthis experiment have been made, some of much greater complexity; but all\r\nagreeing in indicating that the suggested action is prepared for and\r\ndetermined by cerebral processes that do not affect the consciousness of\r\nthe subject, but seem to occur as a system of processes detached from\r\nthe main stream of cerebral activity; that is to say, they imply the\r\noperation of relatively dissociated neural systems.\r\n\r\nMany authorities go further than this; they argue that, since actions of\r\nthe kind described are determined by processes which involve operations,\r\nsuch as counting, that we are accustomed to regard as distinctly mental\r\nin character and that normally involve conscious activity, we must\r\nbelieve that in these cases also consciousness or psychical activity is\r\ninvolved, but that it remains as a separate system or stream of\r\nconsciousness concurrent with the normal or personal consciousness.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the study of various abnormal mental states, especially\r\nthe investigations by French physicians of severe forms of hysteria,\r\nhave brought to light many facts which seem to justify this assumption\r\nof a secondary stream of consciousness, a co- or sub-consciousness\r\ncoexistent with the personal consciousness; although, from the nature of\r\nthe case, an absolute proof of such co-consciousness can hardly be\r\nobtained. The co-consciousness seems to vary in degree of complexity and\r\ncoherence from a mere succession of fragmentary sensations to an\r\norganized stream of mental activity, which may rival in all respects the\r\nprimary consciousness; and in cases of the latter type it is usual to\r\nspeak of the presence of a secondary personality. The co-consciousness\r\nseems in the simpler cases, e.g. in cases of hysterical or hypnotic\r\nanaesthesia, to consist of elements split off from the normal primary\r\nconsciousness, which remains correspondingly poorer; and the assumption\r\nis usually made that such a stream of co-consciousness is the psychical\r\ncorrelate of groups and systems of neurones dissociated from the main\r\nmass of cerebral neurones. If, in spite of serious objections, we\r\nentertain this conception, we find that it helps us to give some account\r\nof various hypnotic phenomena that otherwise remain quite inexplicable;\r\nsome such conception seems to be required more particularly by the facts\r\nof negative hallucination and the execution of post-hypnotic suggestions\r\ninvolving such operations as counting and exact discrimination without\r\nprimary consciousness.\r\n\r\n_Supernormal Hypnotic Phenomena._--The facts hitherto considered,\r\nstrange and perplexing as many of them are, do not seem to demand for\r\ntheir explanation any principles of action fundamentally different from\r\nthose operative in the normal human mind. But much of the interest that\r\nhas centred in hypnotism in recent years has been due to the fact that\r\nsome of its manifestations seem to go beyond all such principles of\r\nexplanation, and to suggest the reality of modes of influence and action\r\nthat science has not hitherto recognized. Of these by far the best\r\nattested are the post-hypnotic unconscious reckoning of time and\r\ntelepathy or \"thought-transference\" (for the latter see TELEPATHY). The\r\npost-hypnotic reckoning and noting of the lapse of time seems in some\r\ninstances to have been carried out, in the absence of all extraneous\r\naids and with complete unconsciousness on the part of the normal\r\npersonality, with such extreme precision that the achievement cannot be\r\naccounted for by any intensification of any faculty that we at present\r\nrecognize or understand. Thus, Dr Milne Bramwell has reported the case\r\nof a patient who, when commanded in hypnosis to perform some simple\r\naction after the lapse of many thousands of minutes, would carry out the\r\nsuggestion punctually to the minute, without any means of knowing the\r\nexact time of day at which the suggestion was given or the time of day\r\nat the moment its performance fell due; more recently a similar case,\r\neven more striking in some respects, has been carefully observed and\r\ndescribed by Dr T. W. Mitchell. Other reported phenomena, such as\r\ntelaesthesia or clairvoyance, and telekinesia, are hardly sufficiently\r\nwell attested to demand serious consideration in this place.\r\n\r\n_Medical Applications of Hypnotism._--The study and practice of\r\nhypnotism is not yet, and probably never will be, regarded as a normal\r\npart of the work of the general practitioner. Its successful application\r\ndemands so much time, tact, and special experience, that it will\r\nprobably remain, as it is now, and as it is perhaps desirable that it\r\nshould remain, a specialized branch of medical practice. In England it\r\nis only in recent years that it has been possible for a medical man to\r\napply it in his practice without incurring professional odium and some\r\nrisk of loss of reputation. That, in certain classes of cases, it may\r\neffect a cure or bring relief when all other modes of treatment are of\r\nno avail is now rapidly becoming recognized; but it is less generally\r\nrecognized that it may be used with great advantage as a supplement to\r\nother modes of treatment in relieving symptoms that are accentuated by\r\nnervous irritability or mental disturbance. A third wide field of\r\nusefulness lies before it in the cure of undesirable habits of many\r\nkinds. Under the first heading may be put insomnia, neuralgia,\r\nneurasthenia, hysteria in almost all its many forms; under the second,\r\ninflammations such as that of chronic rheumatism, contractures and\r\nparalyses resulting from gross lesion of the brain, epilepsy, dyspepsia,\r\nmenstrual irregularities, sea-sickness; under the third, inebriety, the\r\nmorphia and other drug habits, nail-biting, _enuresis nocturna_,\r\nmasturbation, constipation, facial and other twitchings. In pronounced\r\nmental diseases hypnotism seems to be almost useless; for in general\r\nterms it may be said that it can be applied most effectively where the\r\nbrain, the instrument through which it works, is sound and vigorous. The\r\nwidespread prejudice against the use of hypnotism is no doubt largely\r\ndue to the marvellous and (to most minds) mysterious character of the\r\neffects producible by its means; and this prejudice may be expected to\r\ndiminish as our insight into the mode of its operation deepens. The more\r\npurely bodily results achieved by hypnotic suggestion become in some\r\ndegree intelligible if we regard it as a powerful means of diverting\r\nnervous energy from one channel or organ to others, so as to give\r\nphysiological rest to an overworked organ or tissue, or so as to lead to\r\nthe atrophy of one nervous habit and the replacement of it by a more\r\ndesirable habit. And in the cure of those disorders which involve a\r\nlarge mental element the essential part played by it is to drive out\r\nsome habitually recurrent idea and to replace it by some idea,\r\nexpectation or conviction of healthy tendency.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that the various systems of \"mind-curing\" in the hands of\r\npersons lacking all medical training, which are now so frequently the\r\ncause of distressing and needless disasters, owe their rapid spread to\r\nthe fact that the medical profession has hitherto neglected to attach\r\nsufficient importance to the mental factor in the causation and cure of\r\ndisease; and it seems clear, too, that a more general and more\r\nintelligent appreciation of the possibilities of hypnotic treatment\r\nwould constitute the best means at the disposal of the profession for\r\ncombating this growing evil.\r\n\r\n_The Dangers of Hypnotism._--Much has been written on this head of late\r\nyears, and some of the enthusiastic advocates of hypnotic treatment have\r\ndone harm to their cause by ignoring or denying in a too thoroughgoing\r\nmanner the possibility of undesirable results of the spread of the\r\nknowledge and practice of hypnotism. Like all powerful agencies,\r\nchloroform or morphia, dynamite or strong electric currents, hypnotic\r\nsuggestion can only be safely used by those who have special knowledge\r\nand experience, and, like them, it is liable to abuse. There is little\r\ndoubt that, if a subject is repeatedly hypnotized and made to entertain\r\nall kinds of absurd delusions and to carry out very frequently\r\npost-hypnotic suggestions, he may be liable to some ill-defined harm;\r\nalso, that an unprincipled hypnotizer might secure an undue influence\r\nover a naturally weak subject.\r\n\r\nBut there is no ground for the belief that hypnotic treatment, applied\r\nwith good intentions and reasonable care and judgment, does or can\r\nproduce deleterious effects, such as weakening of the will or liability\r\nto fall spontaneously into hypnosis. All physicians of large experience\r\nin hypnotic practice are in agreement in respect to this point. But some\r\ndifference of opinion exists as to the possibility of deliberately\r\ninducing a subject to commit improper or criminal actions during\r\nhypnosis or by post-hypnotic suggestion. There is, however, no doubt\r\nthat subjects retain even in deep hypnosis a very considerable power of\r\nresistance to any suggestion that is repugnant to their moral nature;\r\nand it has been shown that, on some cases in which a subject in hypnosis\r\nis made to perform some ostensibly criminal action, such as firing an\r\nunloaded pistol at a bystander or putting poison into a cup for him to\r\ndrink, he is aware, however obscurely, of the unreal nature of the\r\nsituation. Nevertheless it must be admitted that a person lacking in\r\nmoral sentiments might be induced to commit actions from which in the\r\nnormal state he would abstain, if only from fear of punishment; and it\r\nis probable that a skilful and evil-intentioned operator could in some\r\ncases so deceive a well-disposed subject as to lead him into\r\nwrong-doing. The proper precaution against such dangers is legislative\r\nregulation of the practice of hypnotism such as is already enforced in\r\nsome countries.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The literature of hypnotism has increased in volume at\r\n  a rapid rate during recent years. Of recent writings the following may\r\n  be mentioned as among the most important:--_Treatment by Hypnotism and\r\n  Suggestion_ by C. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D. (5th ed., London, 1907);\r\n  _Hypnotism, its History, Practice and Theory_, by J. Milne Bramwell,\r\n  M.B. (2nd ed., London, 1906); _Hypnotism_, by Albert Moll (5th ed.,\r\n  London, 1901). All these three books give good general accounts of\r\n  hypnotism, the first being the most strictly medical, the last the\r\n  most general in its treatment. See also _Hypnotism: or Suggestion in\r\n  Psycho-Therapy_, by August Forel (translated from the 5th German ed.\r\n  by G. H. W. Armit, London, 1906); a number of papers by Ed. Gurney,\r\n  and by Ed. Gurney and F. W. H. Myers in _Proc. of the Soc. for\r\n  Psychical Research_, especially \"The Stages of Hypnotism,\" in vol.\r\n  ii.; also some more recent papers in the same journal by other hands;\r\n  chapter on Hypnotism in _Human Personality and its Survival of bodily\r\n  Death_, by F. W. H. Myers (London, 1903); _The Psychology of\r\n  Suggestion_, by Boris Sidis, Ph.D. (New York, 1898); \"Zur Psychologie\r\n  der Suggestion,\" by Prof. Th. Lipp, and other papers in the\r\n  _Zeitschrift für Hypnotismus_. Of special historical interest are the\r\n  following:--_Étude sur le zoomagnétisme_, par A. A. Liébeault (Paris,\r\n  1883); _Hypnotisme, suggestion, psycho-thérapie_, par Prof. Bernheim\r\n  (Paris, 1891); _Braid on Hypnotism_ (a new issue of James Braid's\r\n  _Neurypnology_), edited by A. E. Waite (London, 1899); _Traité du\r\n  somnambulisme_, by A. Bertrand (Paris, 1826). A full bibliography is\r\n  appended to Dr Milne Bramwell's _Hypnotism_.     (W. McD.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOCAUST (Gr. [Greek: hypokauston: hypo], beneath, and [Greek: kauein],\r\nto burn), the term given to the chamber formed under the floors of the\r\nRoman baths, through which the hot air from the furnace passed,\r\nsometimes to a single flue, as in the case of the _tepidarium_, but in\r\nthe _calidarium_ and sweating-room to a series of flues placed side by\r\nside forming the lining of the walls. The floor of the hot-air chamber\r\nconsisted of tiles, 2 ft. square, laid on a bed of concrete; on this a\r\nseries of dwarf piers 2 ft. high were built of 8-in. square tiles placed\r\nabout 16 in. apart, which carried the floor of the hall or room; this\r\nfloor was formed of a bed of concrete covered with layers of pounded\r\nbricks and marble cement, on which the marble pavement in slabs or\r\ntesserae was laid. In colder countries, as for instance in Germany and\r\nEngland, the living rooms were all heated in a similar way, and round\r\nTrèves (Trier) both systems have been found in two or three Roman\r\nvillas, with the one flue for the ordinary rooms and several wall flues\r\nfor the hot baths. In England these hypocausts are found in every Roman\r\nsettlement, and the chief interest in these is centred in the\r\nmagnificent mosaic pavements with which the principal rooms were laid.\r\nMany of the pavements found in London and elsewhere have been preserved\r\nin the British or the Guildhall museums; and in some of the provincial\r\ntowns, such as Leicester and Lincoln, they remain _in situ_ many feet\r\nbelow the present level of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOCHONDRIASIS (synonyms--\"the spleen,\" \"the vapours\"), a medical term\r\n(from [Greek: to hypochondrion, ta hypochondria], the soft part of the\r\nbody immediately under the [Greek: chondros] or cartilage of the\r\nbreast-bone) given by the ancients, and indeed by physicians down to the\r\ntime of William Cullen, to diseases or derangements of one or more of\r\nthe abdominal viscera. Cullen (_Clinical Lectures,_ 1777) classified it\r\namongst nervous diseases, and Jean Pierre Falret (1794-1870) more fully\r\ndescribed it as a morbid condition of the nervous system characterized\r\nby depression of feeling and false beliefs as to an impaired state of\r\nthe health. The subjects of hypochondriasis are for the most part\r\nmembers of families in which hereditary predisposition to degradation of\r\nthe nervous system is strong, or those who have suffered from morbid\r\ninfluences affecting this system during the earlier years of life. It\r\nmay be dependent on depressing disease affecting the general system, but\r\nunder such circumstances it is generally so complicated with the\r\nsymptoms of hysteria as to render differentiation difficult (see\r\nHYSTERIA). Hypochondriasis is often handed down from one generation to\r\nanother in its individual form, but it is also not unfrequently to be\r\nmet with in an individual as the sole manifestation in him of a family\r\ntendency to insanity. In its most common form it is manifested by simple\r\nfalse belief as to the state of the health, the intellect being\r\notherwise unaffected. We may instance the \"vapourish\" woman or the\r\n\"splenetic\" as terms society has applied to its milder manifestations.\r\nSuch persons are constantly asserting a weak state of health although no\r\npalpable cause can be discovered. In its more definite phases pain or\r\nuneasy sensations are referred by the patient to some particular region,\r\ngenerally the abdomen, the heart or the head. That these are subjective\r\nis apparent from the fact that the general health is good: all the\r\nfunctions of the various systems are duly performed; the patient eats\r\nand sleeps well; and, when any circumstance temporarily overrides the\r\nfalse belief, he is happy and comfortable. No appeal to the reason is of\r\nany avail, and the hypochondriac idea so dominates his existence as to\r\nrender him unable to perform the ordinary duties of life. In its most\r\naggravated form hypochondriasis amounts to actual insanity, delusions\r\narising as to the existence of living creatures in the intestines or\r\nbrain, or to the effect that the body is materially changed; e.g. into\r\nglass, wood, &c. The symptoms of this condition may be remittent; they\r\nmay even disappear for years, and only return on the advent of some\r\nexciting cause. Suicide is occasionally committed in order to escape\r\nfrom the constant misery. Recovery can only be looked for by placing the\r\npatient under such morally hygienic conditions as may help to turn his\r\nmind to other matters. (See also NEUROPATHOLOGY.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOCRISY, pretence, or false assumption of a high character, especially\r\nin regard to religious belief or practice. The Greek [Greek:\r\nhypokrisis], from which the word is derived through the Old French,\r\nmeant primarily the acting of a part on the stage, from [Greek:\r\nhypokrinesthai], to give an answer, to speak dialogue, play a part on\r\nthe stage, hence to practice dissimulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOSTASIS, in theology, a term frequently occurring in the Trinitarian\r\ncontroversies of the 4th and 5th centuries. According to Irenaeus (i. 5,\r\n4) it was introduced into theology by Gnostic writers, and in earliest\r\necclesiastical usage appears, as among the Stoics, to have been\r\nsynonymous with [Greek: ousia]. Thus Dionysius of Rome (cf. Routh, _Rel.\r\nSacr._ iii. 373) condemns the attempt to sever the Godhead into three\r\nseparate _hypostases_ and three deities, and the Nicene Creed in the\r\nanathemas speaks of [Greek: ex heteras hypostaseôs ê ousias].\r\nAlongside, however, of this persistent interchange there was a desire to\r\ndistinguish between the terms, and to confine [Greek: hypostasis] to the\r\nDivine _persons_. This tendency arose in Alexandria, and its progress\r\nmay be seen in comparing the early and later writings of Athanasius.\r\nThat writer, in view of the Arian trouble, felt that it was better to\r\nspeak of [Greek: ousia] as \"the common undifferentiated substance of\r\nDeity,\" and [Greek: hypostasis] as \"Deity existing in a personal mode,\r\nthe substance of Deity with certain special properties\" ([Greek: ousia\r\nmeta tinôn idiômatôn]). At the council of Alexandria in 362 the phrase\r\n[Greek: treis hypostaseis] was permitted, and the work of this council\r\nwas supplemented by Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa in\r\nthe formula [Greek: mia ousia, treis hypostaseis] or [Greek: mia ousia\r\nen trisin hypostasesin].\r\n\r\n  The results arrived at by these Cappadocian fathers were stated in a\r\n  later age by John of Damascus (_De orth. fid._ iii. 6), quoted in R.\r\n  L. Ottley, _The Doctrine of the Incarnation_, ii. 257.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOSTYLE, in architecture, the term applied to a hall, the flat ceiling\r\nof which is supported by columns, as in the Hall of Columns at Karnak.\r\nIn this case the columns flanking the central avenue are of greater\r\nheight than those of the side aisles, and this admits of openings in the\r\nwall above the smaller columns, through which light is admitted over the\r\naisle roof, through clerestory windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOSULPHITE OF SODA, the name originally given to the substance known\r\nin chemistry as sodium thiosulphate, Na2S2O3; the earlier name is still\r\ncommonly used, especially by photographers, who employ this chemical as\r\na fixer. In systematic chemistry, sodium hyposulphite is a salt of\r\nhyposulphurous acid, to which Schutzenberger gave the formula H2SO2, but\r\nwhich Bernthsen showed to be H2S2O4. (See SULPHUR.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOTHEC (Lat. _hypotheca_, Gr. [Greek: hypothêkê]), in Roman law, the\r\nmost advanced form of the contract of pledge. A specific thing may be\r\ngiven absolutely to a creditor on the understanding that it is to be\r\ngiven back when the creditor's debt is paid; or the property in the\r\nthing may be assigned to the creditor while the debtor is allowed to\r\nremain in possession, the creditor as owner being able to take\r\npossession if his debt is not discharged. Here we have the kind of\r\nsecurity known as pledge and mortgage respectively. In the _hypotheca_,\r\nthe property does not pass to the creditor, nor does he get possession,\r\nbut he acquires a preferential right to have his debt paid out of the\r\nhypothecated property; that is, he can sell it and pay himself out of\r\nthe proceeds, or in default of a purchaser he can become the owner\r\nhimself. The name and the principle have passed into the law of\r\nScotland, which distinguishes between conventional hypothecs, as\r\n_bottomry_ and _respondentia_, and tacit hypothecs established by law.\r\nOf the latter the most important is the landlord's hypothec for rent\r\n(corresponding to distress in the law of England), which extends over\r\nthe produce of the land and the cattle and sheep fed on it, and over\r\nstock and horses used in husbandry. The law of agricultural hypothec\r\nlong caused much discontent in Scotland; its operation was restricted by\r\nthe Hypothec Amendment (Scotland) Act 1867, and finally by the Hypothec\r\nAbolition (Scotland) Act 1880 it was enacted that the \"landlord's right\r\nof hypothec for the rent of land, including the rent of any buildings\r\nthereon, exceeding two acres in extent, let for agriculture or pasture,\r\nshall cease and determine.\" By the same act and by the Agricultural\r\nHoldings (Scotland) Act 1883 other rights and remedies for rent, where\r\nthe right of hypothec had ceased, were given to the landlord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOTHESIS (from Gr. [Greek: hypotithenai], to put under; cf. Lat.\r\n_suppositio_, from _sub-ponere_), in ordinary language, an explanation,\r\nsupposition or assumption, which is put forward in the absence of\r\nascertained facts or causes. Both in ordinary life and in the\r\nacquisition of scientific knowledge hypothesis is all-important. A\r\ndetective's work consists largely in forming and testing hypothesis. If\r\nan astronomer is confronted by some phenomenon which has no obvious\r\nexplanation he may postulate some set of conditions which from his\r\ngeneral knowledge of the subject would or might give rise to the\r\nphenomenon in question; he then tests his hypothesis until he discovers\r\nwhether it does or does not conflict with the facts. An example of this\r\nprocess is that of the discovery of the planet Neptune: certain\r\nperturbations of the orbit of Uranus had been observed, and it was seen\r\nthat these could be explained on the hypothesis of the existence of a\r\nthen unknown planet, and this hypothesis was verified by actual\r\nobservation. The progress of inductive knowledge is by the formation of\r\nsuccessive hypotheses, and it frequently happens that the demolition of\r\none or even many hypotheses is the direct road to a new and accurate\r\nhypothesis, i.e. to fresh knowledge. A hypothesis may, therefore, turn\r\nout to be entirely wrong, yet it may be of the greatest practical use.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the importance of hypotheses has led to various\r\nattempts at drawing up exact rules for their formation, but logicians\r\nare generally agreed that only very elementary principles can be laid\r\ndown. Thus a hypothesis must contain nothing which is at variance with\r\nknown facts or principles: it should not postulate conditions which\r\ncannot be verified empirically. J. S. Mill (_Logic_ III. xiv. 4) laid\r\ndown the principle that a hypothesis is not \"genuinely scientific\" if it\r\nis \"destined always to remain a hypothesis\": it must \"be of such a\r\nnature as to be either proved or disproved by comparison with observed\r\nfacts\": in the same spirit Bacon said that in searching for causes in\r\nnature \"Deum semper excipimus.\" Mill's principle, though sound in the\r\nabstract, has, except in a few cases, little practical value in\r\ndetermining the admissibility of hypotheses, and in practice any rule\r\nwhich tends to discourage hypothesis is in general undesirable. The most\r\nsatisfactory check on hypothesis is expert knowledge in the particular\r\nfield of research by which rigorous tests may be applied. This test is\r\nroughly of two kinds, first by the ultimate principles or\r\npresuppositions on which a particular branch of knowledge rests, and\r\nsecond by the comparison of correlative facts. Useful light is shed on\r\nthis distinction by Lotze, who contrasts (_Logic_, § 273) _postulates_\r\n(\"absolutely necessary assumptions without which the content of the\r\nobservation with which we are dealing would contradict the laws of our\r\nthought\") with _hypotheses_, which he defines as conjectures, which seek\r\n\"to fill up the postulate thus abstractly stated by specifying the\r\nconcrete causes, forces or processes, out of which the given phenomenon\r\nreally arose in this particular case, while in other cases maybe the\r\nsame postulate is to be satisfied by utterly different though equivalent\r\ncombinations of forces or active elements.\" Thus a hypothesis may be\r\nruled out by principles or postulates without any reference to the\r\nconcrete facts which belong to that division of the subject to explain\r\nwhich the hypothesis is formulated. A true hypothesis, therefore, seeks\r\nnot merely to connect or colligate two separate facts, but to do this in\r\nthe light of and subject to certain fundamental principles. Various\r\nattempts have been made to classify hypotheses and to distinguish\r\n\"hypothesis\" from a \"theory\" or a mere \"conjecture\": none of these have\r\nany great practical importance, the differences being only in degree,\r\nnot in kind.\r\n\r\nThe adjective \"hypothetical\" is used, in the same sense, both loosely in\r\ncontradistinction to \"real\" or \"actual,\" and technically in the phrases\r\n\"hypothetical judgment\" and \"hypothetical syllogism.\" (See LOGIC and\r\nSYLLOGISM.)\r\n\r\n  See Naville, _La Logique de l'hypothèse_ (1880), and textbooks of\r\n  logic, e.g. those of Jevons, Bosanquet, Joseph; Liebmann, _Der Klimax\r\n  d. Theorien_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOTRACHELIUM (Gr. [Greek: hypotrachêlion], the lower part of the neck,\r\n[Greek: trachêlos]), in classical architecture, the space between the\r\nannulet of the echinus and the upper bed of the shafts, including,\r\naccording to C. R. Cockerell, the three grooves or sinkings found in\r\nsome of the older examples, as in the temple of Neptune at Paestum and\r\nthe temple of Aphaea at Aegina; there being only one groove in the\r\nParthenon, the Theseum and later examples. In the temple of Ceres and\r\nthe so-called Basilica at Paestum the hypotrachelium consists of a\r\nconcave sinking carved with vertical lines suggestive of leaves, the\r\ntops of which project forward. A similar decoration is found in the\r\ncapital of the columns flanking the tomb of Agamemnon at Mycenae, but\r\nhere the hypotrachelium projects forward with a cavetto moulding, and is\r\ncarved with triple leaves like the buds of a rose. In the Roman Doric\r\nOrder the term was sometimes applied to that which is generally known as\r\nthe \"necking,\" the space between the fillet and the annulet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPSOMETER (Gr. [Greek: hypsos], height, [Greek: metron], a measure), an\r\ninstrument for measuring heights which employs the principles that the\r\nboiling-point of a liquid is lowered by diminishing the pressure, and\r\nthat the barometric pressure varies with the height of the point of\r\nobservation. The instrument consists of a cylindrical vessel in which\r\nthe liquid, usually water, is boiled, surmounted by a jacketed column,\r\nin the outer partitions of which the vapour circulates, while in the\r\ncentral one a thermometer is placed. To deduce the height of the station\r\nfrom the observed boiling-point, it is necessary to know the relation\r\nexisting between the boiling-point and pressure, and also between the\r\npressure and height of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYRACOIDEA, a suborder of ungulate mammals represented at the present\r\nday only by the Syrian hyrax (_Procavia syriaca_), the \"coney\" of the\r\nBible, and its numerous African relatives, all of which may be included\r\nin the single genus _Procavia_ (or _Hyrax_), and consequently in the\r\nfamily _Procaviidae_. These creatures have no proper English name, and\r\nare generally known as hyraxes, from the scientific term (_Hyrax_) by\r\nwhich they were for many years designated--a term which has\r\nunfortunately had to give place to the earlier _Procavia_. In size these\r\nanimals may be compared roughly to rabbits and hares; and they have\r\nrodent-like habits, hunching up their backs after the fashion of some\r\nforeign members of the hare-family, more especially the Liu-Kiu rabbit.\r\nIn the matter of nomenclature these animals have been singularly\r\nunfortunate. In the title \"hyrax\" they have, for instance, usurped the\r\nGreek name for the shrew-mouse; while in the Bible they have been given\r\nthe old English name for the rabbit. Perhaps rock-rabbit would be the\r\nbest name. At the Cape they are known to the Dutch as dass (badger),\r\nwhich has been anglicized into \"dassie.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--The Cape Hyrax (_Procavia capensis_).]\r\n\r\n  As regards the recent forms, the dentition in the fully adult animal\r\n  consists only of incisors and cheek-teeth, the formula being _i._ ½,\r\n  _c._ 0/0, _p._ 4/4 _m._ 3/3. There is, however, a minute upper canine\r\n  developed at first, which is early shed; and in extinct forms this\r\n  tooth was functional and molar-like. The upper incisors have\r\n  persistent pulps, and are curved longitudinally, forming a semicircle\r\n  as in rodents; they are, however, not flattened from before backwards\r\n  as in that order, but prismatic, with an antero-external, an\r\n  antero-internal and a posterior surface, the first two only being\r\n  covered with enamel; their tips are consequently not chisel-shaped,\r\n  but sharp-pointed. They are preceded by functional, rooted milk-teeth.\r\n  The lower incisors have long tapering roots, but not of persistent\r\n  growth; and are straight, directed somewhat forwards, with awl-shaped,\r\n  tri-lobed crowns. Behind the incisors is a considerable gap, followed\r\n  by the cheek-teeth, which are all contiguous, and formed almost\r\n  exactly on the pattern of some of the perissodactyle ungulates. The\r\n  milk-dentition includes three pairs of incisors and one of canines in\r\n  each jaw. The hyoid arch is unlike that of any known mammal. The\r\n  dorsal and lumbar vertebrae are very numerous, 28 to 30, of which 21\r\n  or 22 bear ribs. The tail is extremely short. There are no clavicles.\r\n  In the fore foot, the three middle toes are subequally developed, the\r\n  fifth is present, but smaller, and the first is rudimentary, although,\r\n  in one species at least, all its normal bones are present. The\r\n  terminal phalanges of the four outer digits are small, somewhat\r\n  conical and flattened in form. The carpus has a distinct os centrale.\r\n  There is a slight ridge on the femur in the place of a third\r\n  trochanter. The fibula is complete, thickest at its upper end, where\r\n  it generally unites with the tibia. The articulation between the tibia\r\n  and astragalus is more complex than in other mammals, the end of the\r\n  malleolus entering into it. The hind-foot is very like that of a\r\n  rhinoceros, having three well-developed toes. There is no trace of a\r\n  first toe, and the fifth meta-tarsal is represented by a small nodule.\r\n  The terminal phalange of the inner (or second) digit is deeply cleft,\r\n  and has a peculiar long curved claw, the others having short broad\r\n  nails. The stomach is formed upon much the same principle as that of\r\n  the horse or rhinoceros, but is more elongated transversely and\r\n  divided by a constriction into two cavities--a large left _cul de\r\n  sac_, lined by a very dense white epithelium, and a right pyloric\r\n  cavity, with a thick, soft, vascular lining. The intestinal canal is\r\n  long, and has, in addition to the ordinary short, but capacious and\r\n  sacculated caecum at the commencement of the colon, lower down, a pair\r\n  of large, conical, pointed caeca. The liver is much subdivided, and\r\n  there is no gall-bladder. The brain resembles that of typical\r\n  ungulates far more than that of rodents. The testes are permanently\r\n  abdominal. The ureters open into the fundus of the bladder as in some\r\n  Rodents. The female has six teats, of which four are inguinal and two\r\n  axillary, and the placenta is zonary and deciduous. There is a gland\r\n  on the back.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Skull and Dentition of Tree-Hyrax (_Procavia\r\n  dorsalis_).]\r\n\r\n  The more typical members of the genus are terrestrial in their habits,\r\n  and their cheek-teeth have nearly the same pattern as in rhinoceroses;\r\n  while the interval between the upper incisors is less than the width\r\n  of the teeth; and the lower incisors are only slightly notched at the\r\n  cutting edge. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 22, L. 8, S. 6, C. 6. Of this form\r\n  the earliest known species, _P. capensis_, is the type; but there are\r\n  many other species, as _P. syriaca_, and _P. brucei_ from Syria and\r\n  eastern Africa. They inhabit mountainous and rocky regions, and live\r\n  on the ground. In a second section the molar teeth have the same\r\n  pattern as in _Palaeotherium_ (except that the third lower molar has\r\n  but two lobes); the interval between the upper incisors exceeds the\r\n  width of the teeth; and the lower incisors have distinctly tri-lobed\r\n  crowns. Vertebrae: C. 7, D. 21, L. 7, S. 5, C. 10. The members of this\r\n  section frequent the trunks and large branches of trees, sleeping in\r\n  holes. There are several species from Western and South Africa, as _P.\r\n  arboreus_ and _P. dorsalis_. The members of both groups appear to have\r\n  a power like that possessed by geckos of clinging to vertical surfaces\r\n  of rocks and trees by the soles of their feet.\r\n\r\n  _Extinct Hyracoids._--For many years extinct representatives of the\r\n  Hyracoidea were unknown, partly owing to the fact that certain fossils\r\n  were not recognized as really belonging to that group. The longest\r\n  known of these was originally named _Leptodon graecus_, but, on\r\n  account of the preoccupation of the generic title, the designation has\r\n  been changed to _Pliohyrax graecus_. This animal, whose remains occur\r\n  in the Lower Pliocene of both Attica and Samos, was about the size of\r\n  a donkey, and possessed three pairs of upper incisor teeth, of which\r\n  the innermost were large and trihedral, recalling those of the\r\n  existing genus. On the other hand, the two outer pairs of incisors\r\n  were in contact with one another and with the canines, so as to form\r\n  on each side a series continuous with the cheek-teeth.\r\n\r\n  The next representatives of the group occur in the Upper Eocene beds\r\n  of the Fayum district of Egypt, where the genera _Saghatherium_ and\r\n  _Megalohyrax_ occur. These are regarded as representing a distinct\r\n  family, the _Saghatheriidae_, characterized by the possession of the\r\n  full series of twenty-two teeth in the upper jaw, among which the\r\n  first pair of incisors was modified to form trihedral rootless tusks,\r\n  while the two remaining pairs were separated from one another and from\r\n  the teeth in front by gaps. The canine was like a premolar, and in\r\n  contact with the first tooth of that series; and the cheek-teeth were\r\n  short-crowned, with the premolar simpler than the molars, and a third\r\n  lobe to the last lower tooth of the latter series. The members of\r\n  this genus were small or medium-sized ungulates with single-rooted\r\n  incisors. On the other hand, the representatives of the contemporary\r\n  genus _Megalohyrax_ were approximately as large as _Pliohyrax_, and in\r\n  some instances had double roots to the second and third incisors.\r\n\r\n  It is now possible to define the suborder Hyracoidea as including\r\n  ungulates with a centrale in the carpus, plantigrade feet, in which\r\n  the first and fifth toes are reduced in greater or less degree, and\r\n  clavicles and a foramen in the lower end of the humerus are absent.\r\n  The femur has a small third trochanter, the radius and ulna and tibia\r\n  and fibula are respectively separate, at least in the young, and the\r\n  fibula articulates with the astragalus. The earlier forms had the full\r\n  series of 44 teeth, with the premolars simpler than the molars; but in\r\n  the later types the canines and some of the incisors disappear, and at\r\n  least the hinder premolars become molar-like. In all cases the first\r\n  upper incisors are large and rootless.\r\n\r\n  That the group originated in Africa there can be no reasonable doubt;\r\n  and it is remarkable that so early as the Upper Eocene the types in\r\n  existence differed comparatively little in structure from the modern\r\n  forms. In fact the hyraxes were then almost as distinct from other\r\n  mammals as they are at the present day.\r\n\r\n  See also C. W. Andrews, _Descriptive Catalogue of the Tertiary\r\n  Vertebrata of the Fayum_, British Museum (1906).     (R. L.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYRCANIA. (1) An ancient district of Asia, south of the Caspian Sea, and\r\nbounded on the E. by the river Oxus, called _Virkana_, or \"Wolf's Land,\"\r\nin Old Persian. It was a wide and indefinite tract. Its chief city is\r\ncalled Tape by Strabo, Zadracarta by Arrian (probably the modern\r\nAstarabad). The latter is evidently the same as Carta, mentioned by\r\nStrabo as an important city. Little is known of the history of the\r\ncountry. Xenophon says it was subdued by the Assyrians; Curtius that\r\n6000 Hyrcanians were in the army of Darius III. (2) Two towns named\r\nHyrcania are mentioned, one in Hyrcania, the other in Lydia. The latter\r\nis said to have derived its name from a colony of Hyrcanians,\r\ntransported thither by the Persians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYRCANUS ([Greek: Hykanos]), a Greek surname, of unknown origin, borne\r\nby several Jews of the Maccabaean period.\r\n\r\nJOHN HYRCANUS I., high priest of the Jews from 135 to 105 B.C., was the\r\nyoungest son of Simon Maccabaeus. In 137 B.C. he, along with his brother\r\nJudas, commanded the force which repelled the invasion of Judaea led by\r\nCendebeus, the general of Antiochus VII. _Sidetes_. On the assassination\r\nof his father and two elder brothers by Ptolemy, governor of Jericho,\r\nhis brother-in-law, in February 135, he succeeded to the high priesthood\r\nand the supreme authority in Judaea. While still engaged in the struggle\r\nwith Ptolemy, he was attacked by Antiochus with a large army (134), and\r\ncompelled to shut himself up in Jerusalem; after a severe siege peace\r\nwas at last secured only on condition of a Jewish disarmament, and the\r\npayment of an indemnity and an annual tribute, for which hostages were\r\ntaken. In 129 he accompanied Antiochus as a vassal prince on his\r\nill-fated Parthian expedition; returning, however, to Judaea before\r\nwinter, he escaped the final disaster. By the judicious mission of an\r\nembassy to Rome he now obtained confirmation of the alliance which his\r\nfather had previously made with the growing western power; at the same\r\ntime he availed himself of the weakened state of the Syrian monarchy\r\nunder Demetrius II. to overrun Samaria, and also to invade Idumaea,\r\nwhich he completely subdued, compelling its inhabitants to receive\r\ncircumcision and accept the Jewish faith. After a long period of rest he\r\ndirected his arms against the town of Samaria, which, in spite of the\r\nintervention of Antiochus, his sons Antigonus and Aristobulus ultimately\r\ntook, and by his orders razed to the ground (c. 100 B.C.). He died in\r\n105, and was succeeded by Aristobulus, the eldest of his five sons. The\r\nexternal policy of Hyrcanus was marked by considerable energy and tact,\r\nand, aided as it was by favouring circumstances, was so successful as to\r\nleave the Jewish nation in a position of independence and of influence\r\nsuch as it had not known since the days of Solomon. During its later\r\nyears his reign was much disturbed, however, by the contentions for\r\nascendancy which arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, the two\r\nrival sects or parties which then for the first time (under those names\r\nat least) came into prominence. Josephus has related the curious\r\ncircumstances under which he ultimately transferred his personal support\r\nfrom the former to the latter.\r\n\r\nJOHN HYRCANUS II., high priest from 78 to 40 B.C., was the eldest son of\r\nAlexander Jannaeus by his wife Alexandra, and was thus a grandson of the\r\npreceding. When his father died in 78, he was by his mother forthwith\r\nappointed high priest, and on her death in 69 he claimed the succession\r\nto the supreme civil authority also; but, after a brief and troubled\r\nreign of three months, he was compelled to abdicate both kingly and\r\npriestly dignities in favour of his more energetic and ambitious younger\r\nbrother Aristobulus II. In 63 it suited the policy of Pompey that he\r\nshould be restored to the high priesthood, with some semblance of\r\nsupreme command, but of much of this semblance even he was soon again\r\ndeprived by the arrangement of the pro-consul Gabinius, according to\r\nwhich Palestine was in 57 B.C. divided into five separate circles\r\n([Greek: synodoi, synedria]). For services rendered to Caesar after the\r\nbattle of Pharsalia, he was again rewarded with the sovereignty ([Greek:\r\nprostasia tou ethnous], Jos. _Ant._ xx. 10) in 47 B.C., Antipater of\r\nIdumaea, however, being at the same time made procurator of Judaea. In\r\n41 B.C. he was practically superseded by Antony's appointment of Herod\r\nand Phasael to be tetrarchs of Judaea; and in the following year he was\r\ntaken prisoner by the Parthians, deprived of his ears that he might be\r\npermanently disqualified for priestly office, and carried to Babylon. He\r\nwas permitted in 33 B.C. to return to Jerusalem, where on a charge of\r\ntreasonable correspondence with Malchus, king of Arabia, he was put to\r\ndeath in 30 B.C.\r\n\r\n  See Josephus (_Ant._ xiii. 8-10; xiv. 5-13; _Bell. Jud._ i. 2; i.\r\n  8-13). Also MACCABEES, _History_.     (J. H. A. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYSSOP (_Hyssopus officinalis_), a garden herb belonging to the natural\r\norder _Labiatae_, formerly cultivated for use in domestic medicine. It\r\nis a small perennial plant about 2 ft. high, with slender, quadrangular,\r\nwoody stems; narrowly elliptical, pointed, entire, dotted leaves, about\r\n1 in. long and 1/3 in. wide, growing in pairs on the stem; and long\r\nterminal, erect, half-whorled, leafy spikes of small violet-blue\r\nflowers, which are in blossom from June to September. Varieties of the\r\nplant occur in gardens with red and white flowers, also one having\r\nvariegated leaves. The leaves have a warm, aromatic, bitter taste, and\r\nare believed to owe their properties to a volatile oil which is present\r\nin the proportion of ¼ to ½%. Hyssop is a native of the south of Europe,\r\nits range extending eastward to central Asia. A strong tea made of the\r\nleaves, and sweetened with honey, was formerly used in pulmonary and\r\ncatarrhal affections, and externally as an application to bruises and\r\nindolent swellings.\r\n\r\nThe hedge hyssop (_Gratiola officinalis_) belongs to the natural order\r\n_Scrophulariaceae_, and is a native of marshy lands in the south of\r\nEurope, whence it was introduced into Britain more than 300 years ago.\r\nLike _Hyssopus officinalis_, it has smooth opposite entire leaves, but\r\nthe stems are cylindrical, the leaves twice the size, and the flowers\r\nsolitary in the axils of the leaves and having a yellowish-red veined\r\ntube and bluish-white limb, while the capsules are oval and many-seeded.\r\nThe herb has a bitter, nauseous taste, but is almost odourless. In small\r\nquantities it acts as a purgative, diuretic and emetic when taken\r\ninternally. It was formerly official in the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia,\r\nbeing esteemed as a remedy for dropsy. It is said to have formed the\r\nbasis of a celebrated nostrum for gout, called _Eau médicinale_, and in\r\nformer times was called _Gratia Dei_. When growing in abundance, as it\r\ndoes in some damp pastures in Switzerland, it becomes dangerous to\r\ncattle. G. _peruviana_ is known to possess similar properties.\r\n\r\n  The hyssop (_'ezob_) of Scripture (Ex. xii. 22; Lev. xiv. 4, 6; Numb.\r\n  xix. 6, 18; 1 Kings v. 13 (iv. 33); Ps. li. 9 (7); John xix. 29), a\r\n  wall-growing plant adapted for sprinkling purposes, has long been the\r\n  subject of learned disputation, the only point on which all have\r\n  agreed being that it is not to be identified with the _Hyssopus\r\n  officinalis_, which is not a native of Palestine. No fewer than\r\n  eighteen plants have been supposed by various authors to answer the\r\n  conditions, and Celsius has devoted more than forty pages to the\r\n  discussion of their several claims. By Tristram (_Oxford Bible for\r\n  Teachers_, 1880) and others the caper plant (_Capparis spinosa_) is\r\n  supposed to be meant; but, apart from other difficulties, this\r\n  identification is open to the objection that the caper seems to be, at\r\n  least in one passage (Eccl. xii. 5), otherwise designated\r\n  (_'abiy-yônah_). Thenius (on 1 Kings v. 13) suggests _Orthotrichum\r\n  saxatile_. The most probable opinion would seem to be that found in\r\n  Maimonides and many later writers, according to which the Hebrew\r\n  _'ezob_ is to be identified with the Arabic _sa'atar_, now understood\r\n  to be _Satureja Thymus_, a plant of very frequent occurrence in Syria\r\n  and Palestine, with which _Thymus Serpyllum_, or wild thyme, and\r\n  _Satureja Thymbra_ are closely allied. Its smell, taste and medicinal\r\n  properties are similar to those of _H. officinalis_. In Morocco the\r\n  _sa'atar_ of the Arabs is _Origanum compactum_; and it appears\r\n  probable that several plants of the genera _Thymus_, _Origanum_ and\r\n  others nearly allied in form and habit, and found in similar\r\n  localities, were used under the name of hyssop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYSTASPES (the Greek form of the Persian _Vishtaspa_). (1) A\r\nsemi-legendary king (_kava_), praised by Zoroaster as his protector and\r\na true believer, son of Aurvataspa (Lohrasp). The later tradition and\r\nthe Shahname of Firdousi makes him (in the modern form Kai Gushtasp)\r\nking of Iran. As Zoroaster probably preached his religion in eastern\r\nIran, Vishtaspa must have been a dynast in Bactria or Sogdiana. The\r\nZoroastrian religion was already dominant in Media in the time of the\r\nAssyrian king Sargon (c. 715 B.C.), and had been propagated here\r\nprobably in much earlier times (cf. PERSIA); the time of Zoroaster and\r\nVishtaspa may therefore be put at c. 1000 B.C. (2) A Persian, father of\r\nDarius I., under whose reign he was governor of Parthia, as Darius\r\nhimself mentions in the Behistun inscription (2. 65). By Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus, xxiii. 6. 32, and by many modern authors he has been\r\nidentified with the protector of Zoroaster, which is equally impossible\r\nfor chronological and historical reasons, and from the evidence of the\r\ndevelopment of Zoroastrianism itself (see PERSIA: _Ancient History_).\r\n     (Ed. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYSTERESIS (Gr. [Greek: hysterêsis], from [Greek: hysterein], to lag\r\nbehind), a term added to the vocabulary of physical science by J. A.\r\nEwing, who defines it as follows: When there are two qualities M and N\r\nsuch that cyclic variations of N cause cyclic variations of M, then if\r\nthe changes of M lag behind those of N, we may say that there is\r\nhysteresis in the relation of M to N (_Phil. Trans._, 1885, 176, p.\r\n524). The phenomenon is best known in connexion with magnetism. If an\r\niron bar is subjected to a magnetic force which is first gradually\r\nincreased to a maximum and then gradually diminished, the resulting\r\nmagnetization of the bar for any given value of the magnetic force will\r\nbe greater when the force is decreasing than when it is increasing; the\r\niron always tends to retain the magnetic condition which it has\r\npreviously acquired, and changes of its magnetization consequently lag\r\nbehind changes of the magnetic force. Thus there is hysteresis in the\r\nrelation of magnetization to magnetic force. In consequence of\r\nhysteresis the process of magnetizing a piece of iron to a certain\r\nintensity and then restoring it to its original condition, or of\r\neffecting a double reversal of its magnetization, involves the\r\nexpenditure of energy, which is dissipated as heat in the iron.\r\nElectrical generators and transformers often contain pieces of iron the\r\nmagnetization of which is reversed many times in a second, and in order\r\nto economize power and to avoid undue heating it is essential that\r\nhysteresis should in such cases be as small as possible. Iron and mild\r\nsteels showing remarkably little hysteresis are now specially\r\nmanufactured for use in the construction of electrical machinery. (See\r\nMAGNETISM.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYSTERIA, a term applied to an affection which may manifest itself by a\r\nvariety of symptoms, and which depends upon a disordered condition of\r\nthe highest nervous centres. It is characterized by psychical\r\npeculiarities, while in addition there is often derangement of the\r\nfunctions subserved by the lower cerebral and spinal centres.\r\nHistological examination of the nervous system has failed to disclose\r\nassociated structural alterations.\r\n\r\nBy the ancients and by modern physicians down to the time of Sydenham\r\nthe symptoms of hysteria were supposed to be directly due to\r\ndisturbances of the uterus (Gr. [Greek: hystera], whence the name). This\r\nview is now universally recognized to be erroneous. The term\r\n\"functional\" is often used by English neurologists as synonymous with\r\nhysterical, a nomenclature which is tentatively advantageous since it is\r\nat least non-committal. P. J. Möbius has defined hysteria as \"a state in\r\nwhich ideas control the body and produce morbid changes in its\r\nfunctions.\" P. Janet, who has done much to popularize the psychical\r\norigin of the affection, holds that there is \"a limitation of the field\r\nof consciousness\" comparable to the contraction of the visual fields met\r\nwith in the disease. The hysterical subject, according to this view, is\r\nincapable of taking into the field of consciousness all the impressions\r\nof which the normal individual is conscious. Strong momentary\r\nimpressions are no longer controlled so efficiently because of the\r\ndefective simultaneous impressions of previous memories. Hence the\r\nreadiness with which the impulse of the moment is obeyed, the loss of\r\nemotional control and the increased susceptibility to external\r\nsuggestion, which are so characteristic. A secondary subconscious mental\r\nstate is engendered by the relegation of less prominent impressions to a\r\nlower sphere. The dual personality which is typically exemplified in\r\nsomnambulism and in the hypnotic state is thus induced. The explanation\r\nof hysterical symptoms which are independent of the will, and of the\r\nexistence of which the individual may be unaware, is to be found in a\r\nrelative preponderance of this secondary subconscious state as compared\r\nwith the primary conscious personality. An elaboration of this theory\r\naffords an explanation of hysterical symptoms dependent upon a \"fixed\r\nidea.\" The following definition of hysteria has recently been advanced\r\nby J. F. F. Babinski: \"Hysteria is a psychical condition manifesting\r\nitself principally by signs that may be termed primary, and in an\r\naccessory sense others that we may call secondary. The characteristic of\r\nthe primary signs is that they may be exactly reproduced in certain\r\nsubjects by suggestion and dispelled by persuasion. The characteristic\r\nof the secondary signs is that they are closely related to the primary\r\nphenomena.\"\r\n\r\nThe causes of hysteria may be divided into (a) the predisposing, such as\r\nhereditary predisposition to nervous disease, sex, age and national\r\nidiosyncrasy; and (b) the immediate, such as mental and physical\r\nexhaustion, fright and other emotional influences, pregnancy, the\r\npuerperal condition, diseases of the uterus and its appendages, and the\r\ndepressing influence of injury or general disease. Perhaps, taken over\r\nall, hereditary predisposition to nerve-instability may be asserted as\r\nthe most prolific cause. There is frequently direct inheritance, and\r\ncases of epilepsy and insanity or other form of nervous disease are\r\nrarely wanting when the family history is carefully enquired into. As\r\nregards age, the condition is apt to appear at the evolution periods of\r\nlife--puberty, pregnancy and the climacteric--without any further\r\nassignable cause except that first spoken of. It is rare in young\r\nchildren, but very frequent in girls between the ages of fifteen and\r\ntwenty-five, while it sometimes manifests itself in women at the\r\nmenopause. It is much more common in the female than in the male--in the\r\nproportion of 20 to 1. Certain races are more liable to the disease than\r\nothers; thus the Latin races are much more prone to hysteria than are\r\nthose who come of a Teutonic stock, and in more aggravated and complex\r\nforms. In England it has been asserted that an undue proportion of cases\r\noccur among Jews. Occupation, or be it rather said want of occupation,\r\nis a prolific cause. This is noticeable more especially in the higher\r\nclasses of society.\r\n\r\nAn hysterical attack may occur as an immediate sequel to an epileptic\r\nfit. If the patient suffers only from _petit mal_ (see EPILEPSY),\r\nunaccompanied by true epileptic fits, the significance of the hysterical\r\nseizure, which is really a post-epileptic phenomenon, may remain\r\nunrecognized.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to group the very varied symptoms of hysteria into\r\nparoxysmal and chronic. The popular term \"hysterics\" is applied to an\r\nexplosion of emotionalism, generally the result of mental excitement, on\r\nwhich convulsive fits may supervene. The characters of these vary, and\r\nmay closely resemble epilepsy. The hysterical fit is generally preceded\r\nby an aura or warning. This sometimes takes the form of a sensation as\r\nof a lump in the throat (_globus hystericus_). The patient may fall, but\r\nvery rarely is injured in so doing. The eyes are often tightly closed,\r\nthe body and limbs become rigid, and the back may become so arched that\r\nthe patient rests on her heels and head (_opisthotonos_). This stage is\r\nusually followed by violent struggling movements. There is no loss of\r\nconsciousness. The attack may last for half-an-hour or even longer.\r\nHysterical fits in their fully-developed form are rarely seen in\r\nEngland, though common in France. In the chronic condition we find an\r\nextraordinary complexity of symptoms, both physical and mental. The\r\nphysical symptoms are extremely diverse. There may be a paralysis of one\r\nor more limbs associated with rigidity, which may persist for weeks,\r\nmonths or years. In some cases, the patient is unable to walk; in others\r\nthere are peculiarities of the gait quite unlike anything met with in\r\norganic disease. Perversions of sensation are usually present; a common\r\ninstance is the sensation of a nail being driven through the vertex of\r\nthe head (_clavus hystericus_). The region of the spine is a very\r\nfrequent seat of hysterical pain. Loss of sensation (_anaesthesia_), of\r\nwhich the patient may be unaware, is of common occurrence. Very often\r\nthis sensory loss is limited exactly to one-half of the body, including\r\nthe leg, arm and face on that side (_hemianaesthesia_). Sensation to\r\ntouch, pain, heat and cold, and electrical stimuli may have completely\r\ndisappeared in the anaesthetic region. In other cases, the anaesthesia\r\nis relative or it may be partial, certain forms of sensation remaining\r\nintact. Anaesthesia is almost always accompanied by an inability to\r\nrecognize the exact position of the affected limb when the eyes are\r\nclosed. When hemianaesthesia is present, sight, hearing, taste and smell\r\nare usually impaired on that side of the body. Often there is loss of\r\nvoice (hysterical aphonia). It is to such cases of hysterical paralysis\r\nand sensory disturbance that the wonderful cures effected by quacks and\r\ncharlatans may be referred. The mental symptoms have not the same\r\ntendency to pass away suddenly. They may be spoken of as\r\ninter-paroxysmal and paroxysmal. The chief characteristics of the former\r\nare extreme emotionalism combined with obstructiveness, a desire to be\r\nan object of interest and a constant craving for sympathy which is often\r\nprocured at an immense sacrifice of personal comfort. Obstructiveness is\r\nthe invariable symptom. Hysteria may pass into absolute insanity.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of hysteria demands great tact and firmness on the part of\r\nthe physician. The affection is a definite entity and has to be clearly\r\ndistinguished from malingering, with which it is so often erroneously\r\nregarded as synonymous. Drugs are of little value. The moral treatment\r\nis all-important. In severe cases, removal from home surroundings and\r\nisolation, either in a hospital ward or nursing home, are essential, in\r\norder that full benefit may be derived from psychotherapeutic measures.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Charcot, _Leçons sur les maladies du système nerveuse_\r\n  (1877); S.

S.E. by E.\r\nof London on a branch of the South Eastern & Chatham railway. Pop.\r\n(1901) 5557. It is beautifully situated at the foot of a steep hill near\r\nthe eastern extremity of Romney Marsh, about half a mile from the sea,\r\nand consists principally of one long street running parallel with the\r\nshore, with which it is connected by a straight avenue of wych elms. On\r\naccount of its fine situation and picturesque and interesting\r\nneighbourhood, it is a favourite watering-place. A sea-wall and parade\r\nextend eastward to Sandgate, a distance of 3 m. There is communication\r\nwith Sandgate by means of a tramway along the front. On the slope of the\r\nhill above the town stands the fine church of St Leonard, partly Late\r\nNorman, with a very beautiful Early English chancel. The tower was\r\nrebuilt about 1750. In a vault under the chancel there is a collection\r\nof human skulls and bones supposed to be the remains of men killed in a\r\nbattle near Hythe in 456. Lionel Lukin (1742-1834), inventor of the\r\nlife-boat, is buried in the churchyard. Hythe possesses a guildhall\r\nfounded in 1794 and two hospitals, that of St Bartholomew founded by\r\nHaimo, bishop of Rochester, in 1336, and that of St John (rebuilt in\r\n1802), of still greater antiquity but unknown date, founded originally\r\nfor the reception of lepers. A government school of musketry, in which\r\ninstructors for the army are trained, was established in 1854, and has\r\nbeen extended since, and the Shorncliffe military camp is within 2½ m.\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\nLympne, which is now 3 m. inland, is thought to have been the original\r\nharbour which gave Hythe a place among the Cinque Ports. The course of\r\nthe ancient estuary may be distinctly traced from here along the road to\r\nHythe, the sea-sand lying on the surface and colouring the soil. Here\r\nare remains of a Roman fortress, and excavations have brought to light\r\nmany remains of the Roman _Portus Lemanis_. Large portions of the\r\nfortress walls are standing. At the south-west corner is one of the\r\ncircular towers which occurred along the line of wall. The site is now\r\noccupied by the fine old castellated mansion of Studfall castle,\r\nformerly a residence of the archdeacons of Canterbury. The name denotes\r\na fallen place, and is not infrequently thus applied to ancient remains.\r\nThe church at Lympne is Early English, with a Norman tower built by\r\nArchbishop Lanfranc, and Roman material may be traced in the walls. A\r\nshort distance east is Shipway or Shepway Cross, where some of the great\r\nassemblies relating to the Cinque Ports were held. A mile north from\r\nHythe is Saltwood Castle, of very ancient origin, but rebuilt in the\r\ntime of Richard II. The castle was granted to the see of Canterbury in\r\n1026, but escheated to the crown in the time of Henry II., when the\r\nmurder of Thomas à Beckett is said to have been concerted here, and\r\nhaving been restored to the archbishops by King John remained a\r\nresidence of theirs until the time of Henry VIII. It was restored as a\r\nresidence in 1882. About 2 m. N.W. of Saltwood are remains of the\r\nfortified 14th-century manor-house of Westenhanger. It is quadrangular\r\nand surrounded by a moat, and of the nine towers (alternately square and\r\nround) by which the walls were defended, three remain.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary borough of Hythe, which includes Folkestone, Sandgate\r\nand a number of neighbouring villages, returns one member. The town is\r\ngoverned by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area 2617 acres.\r\n\r\nHythe (Heda, Heya, Hethe, Hithe, _i.e._ landing-place) was known as a\r\nport in Saxon times, and was granted by Halfden, a Saxon thegn, to\r\nChrist Church, Canterbury. In the Domesday Survey the borough is entered\r\namong the archbishop's lands as appurtenant to his manor of Saltwood,\r\nand the bailiff of the town was appointed by the archbishop. Hythe was\r\nevidently a Cinque Port before the Conquest, as King John in 1205\r\nconfirmed the liberties, viz. freedom from toll, the right to be\r\nimpleaded only at the Shepway court, &c., which the townsmen had under\r\nEdward the Confessor. The liberties of the Cinque Ports were confirmed\r\nin Magna Carta and later by Edward I. in a general charter, which was\r\nconfirmed, often with additions, by subsequent kings down to James II.\r\nJohn's charter to Hythe was confirmed by Henry IV., Henry V. and Henry\r\nVI. These charters were granted to the Cinque Ports in return for the\r\nfifty-seven ships which they supplied for the royal service, of which\r\nfive were contributed by Hythe. The ports were first represented in the\r\nparliament of 1365, to which they each sent four members.\r\n\r\nHythe was governed by twelve jurats until 1574, when it was incorporated\r\nby Elizabeth under the title of the mayor, jurats and commonalty of\r\nHythe; a fair for the sale of fish, &c., was also granted, to be held on\r\nthe feast of St Peter and St Paul. As the sea gradually retreated from\r\nHythe and the harbour became choked up with sand, the town suffered the\r\nfate of other places near it, and lost its old importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI   the ninth letter of the English and Latin alphabet, the tenth in the\r\nGreek and Phoenician, because in these the symbol Teth (the Greek\r\n[theta]) preceded it. Teth was not included in the Latin alphabet\r\nbecause that language had no sound corresponding to the Greek [theta],\r\nbut the symbol was metamorphosed and utilized as the numeral C = 100,\r\nwhich took this form through the influence of the initial letter of the\r\nLatin _centum_. The name of I in the Phoenician alphabet was _Yod_.\r\nThough in form it seems the simplest of letters it was originally much\r\nmore complex. In Phoenician it takes the form [symbol], which is found\r\nalso in the earliest Syriac and Palestinian inscriptions with little\r\nmodification. Ultimately in Hebrew it became reduced to a very small\r\nsymbol, whence comes its use as a term of contempt for things of no\r\nimportance as in \"not one _jot_ or tittle\" (Matthew v. 18). The name\r\npassed from Phoenician to Greek, and thence to the Latin of the vulgate\r\nas _iota_, and from the Latin the English word is derived. Amongst the\r\nGreeks of Asia it appears only as the simple upright I, but in some of\r\nthe oldest alphabets elsewhere, as Crete, Thera, Attica, Achaia and its\r\ncolonies in lower Italy, it takes the form [symbol] or S, while at\r\nCorinth and Corcyra it appears first in a form closely resembling the\r\nlater Greek _sigma_ [Sigma]. It had originally no cross-stroke at top\r\nand bottom. I being not _i_ but _z_. The Phoenician alphabet having no\r\nvowel symbols, the value of _yod_ was that of the English _y_. In Greek,\r\nwhere the consonant sound had disappeared or been converted into _h_, I\r\nis regularly used as a vowel. Occasionally, as in Pamphylian, it is used\r\ndialectically as a glide between _i_ and another vowel, as in the proper\r\nname [Greek: Damatriius]. In Latin I was used alike for both vowel and\r\nconsonant, as in _iugum_ (yoke). The sound represented by it was\r\napproximately that still assigned to _i_ on the continent. Neither Greek\r\nnor Latin made any distinction in writing between short and long _i_,\r\nthough in the Latin of the Empire the long sound was occasionally\r\nrepresented by a longer form of the symbol I. The dot over the _i_\r\nbegins in the 5th or 6th century A.D. In pronunciation the English short\r\n_i_ is a more open sound than that of most languages, and does not\r\ncorrespond to the Greek and Latin sound. Nor are the English short and\r\nlong _i_ of the same quality. The short _i_ in Sweet's terminology is a\r\nhigh-front-wide vowel, the long _i_, in English often spelt _ee_ in\r\nwords like _seed_, is diphthonged, beginning like the short vowel but\r\nbecoming higher as it proceeds. The Latin short _i_, however, in final\r\nsyllables was open and ultimately became _e_, e.g. in the neuter of\r\n_i_-stems as _utile_ from _utili-s_. Medially both the short and the\r\nlong sounds are very common in syllables which were originally\r\nunaccented, because in such positions many other sounds passed into _i_:\r\n_officio_ but _facio_, _redimo_ but _emo_, _quidlibet_ but _lubet_\r\n(_libet_ is later); _collido_ but _laedo_, _fido_ from an older _feido_,\r\n_istis_ (dative plural) from an earlier _istois_.     (P. Gi.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIAMBIC, the term employed in prosody to denote a succession of verses,\r\neach consisting of a foot or metre called an iambus ([Greek: iambos]),\r\nformed of two syllables, of which the first is short and the second long\r\n(u --). After the dactylic hexameter, the iambic trimeter was the most\r\npopular metre of ancient Greece. Archilochus is said to have been the\r\ninventor of this iambic verse, the [Greek: trimetros] consisting of\r\nthree iambic fed. In the Greek tragedians an iambic line is formed of\r\nsix feet arranged in obedience to the following scheme:--\r\n\r\n  u   --  | u   --  | u   --  | u   --  | u   --  | u   --  |\r\n  u  u  u | u  u  u | u  u  u | u  u  u | u  u  u |         |\r\n  --  --  |         |  --  -- |         | --  --  |         |\r\n  -- u  u |         | -- u  u |         |         |         |\r\n  u  u -- |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n\r\nMuch of the beauty of the verse depends on the caesura, which is usually\r\nIn the middle of the third foot, and far less frequently in the middle\r\nof the fourth. The English language runs more naturally in the iambic\r\nmetre than in any other. The normal blank verse in English is founded\r\nupon an iambic basis, and Milton's line--\r\n\r\n  And swims | or sinks | or wades | or creeps | or flies | --\r\n\r\nexhibits it in its primitive form. The ordinary alexandrine of French\r\nliterature is a hexapod iambic, but in all questions of quantity in\r\nmodern prosody great care has to be exercised to recollect that all\r\nascriptions of classic names to modern forms of rhymed or blank verse\r\nare merely approximate. The octosyllabic, or four-foot iambic metre, has\r\nfound great favour in English verse founded on old romances.\r\nDecasyllabic iambic lines rhyming together form an \"heroic\" metre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIAMBLICHUS (d. c. A.D. 330), the chief representative of Syrian\r\nNeoplatonism, is only imperfectly known to us in the events of his life\r\nand the details of his creed. We learn, however, from Suidas, and from\r\nhis biographer Eunapius, that he was born at Chalcis in Coele-Syria, the\r\nscion of a rich and illustrious family, that he studied under Anatolius\r\nand afterwards under Porphyry, the pupil of Plotinus, that he himself\r\ngathered together a large number of disciples of different nations with\r\nwhom he lived on terms of genial friendship, that he wrote \"various\r\nphilosophical books,\" and that he died during the reign of\r\nConstantine,--according to Fabricius, before A.D. 333. His residence\r\n(probably) at his native town of Chalcis was varied by a yearly visit\r\nwith his pupils to the baths of Gadara. Of the books referred to by\r\nSuidas only a fraction has been preserved. His commentaries on Plato and\r\nAristotle, and works on the Chaldaean theology and on the soul, are\r\nlost. For our knowledge of his system we are indebted partly to the\r\nfragments of these writings preserved by Stobaeus and others, and to the\r\nnotices of his successors, especially Proclus, partly to his five extant\r\nbooks, the sections of a great work on the Pythagorean philosophy.\r\nBesides these, Proclus (412-485) seems to have ascribed to him[1] the\r\nauthorship of the celebrated book _On the Egyptian Mysteries_\r\n(so-called), and although its differences in style and in some points of\r\ndoctrine from the writings just mentioned make it improbable that the\r\nwork was by Iamblichus himself, it certainly emanated from his school,\r\nand in its systematic attempt to give a speculative justification of the\r\npolytheistic cultus of the day, marks the turning-point in the history\r\nof thought at which Iamblichus stood.\r\n\r\nAs a speculative theory Neoplatonism (q.v.) had received its highest\r\ndevelopment from Plotinus. The modifications introduced by Iamblichus\r\nwere the elaboration in greater detail of its formal divisions, the more\r\nsystematic application of the Pythagorean number-symbolism, and chiefly,\r\nunder the influence of Oriental systems, the thorough-going mythic\r\ninterpretation of what the previous philosophy had still regarded as\r\nnotional. It is on the last account, probably, that Iamblichus was\r\nlooked upon with such extravagant veneration. As a philosopher he had\r\nlearning indeed, but little originality. His aim was to give a\r\nphilosophical rendering of the popular religion. By his contemporaries\r\nhe was accredited with miraculous powers (which he, however,\r\ndisclaimed), and by his followers in the decline of Greek philosophy,\r\nand his admirers on its revival in the 15th and 16th centuries, his name\r\nwas scarcely mentioned without the epithet \"divine\" or \"most divine,\"\r\nwhile, not content with the more modest eulogy of Eunapius that he was\r\ninferior to Porphyry only in style, the emperor Julian regarded him as\r\nnot even second to Plato, and said that he would give all the gold of\r\nLydia for one epistle of Iamblichus.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the philosophy of Plotinus was an attempt to harmonize\r\nthe principles of the various Greek schools. At the head of his system\r\nhe placed the transcendent incommunicable one ([Greek: hen amethekton]),\r\nwhose first-begotten is intellect ([Greek: nous]), from which proceeds\r\nsoul ([Greek: psychê]), which in turn gives birth to [Greek: physis],\r\nthe realm of nature. Immediately after the absolute one, Iamblichus\r\nintroduced a second superexistent unity to stand between it and the many\r\nas the producer of intellect, and made the three succeeding moments of\r\nthe development (intellect, soul and nature) undergo various\r\nmodifications. He speaks of them as intellectual ([Greek: theoi\r\nnoeroi]), supramundane ([Greek: hyperkosmioi]), and mundane gods\r\n([Greek: egkosmioi]). The first of these--which Plotinus represented\r\nunder the three stages of (objective) being ([Greek: on]), (subjective)\r\nlife ([Greek: zôê]), and (realized) intellect ([Greek: nous])--is\r\ndistinguished by him into spheres of intelligible gods ([Greek: theoi\r\nnoêtoi]) and of intellectual gods ([Greek: theoi noeroi]), each\r\nsubdivided into triads, the latter sphere being the place of ideas, the\r\nformer of the archetypes of these ideas. Between these two worlds, at\r\nonce separating and uniting them, some scholars think there was inserted\r\nby Iamblichus, as afterwards by Proclus, a third sphere partaking of the\r\nnature of both ([Greek: theoi noêtoi kai noeroi]). But this supposition\r\ndepends on a merely conjectural emendation of the text. We read,\r\nhowever, that \"in the intellectual hebdomad he assigned the third rank\r\namong the fathers to the Demiurge.\" The Demiurge, Zeus, or\r\nworld-creating potency, is thus identified with the perfected [Greek:\r\nnous], the intellectual triad being increased to a hebdomad, probably\r\n(as Zeller supposes) through the subdivision of its first two members.\r\nAs in Plotinus [Greek: nous] produced nature by mediation of [Greek:\r\npsychê], so here the intelligible gods are followed by a triad of\r\npsychic gods. The first of these is incommunicable and supramundane,\r\nwhile the other two seem to be mundane though rational. In the third\r\nclass, or mundane gods ([Greek: theoi egkosmioi]), there is a still\r\ngreater wealth of divinities, of various local position, function, and\r\nrank. We read of gods, angels, demons and heroes, of twelve heavenly\r\ngods whose number is increased to thirty-six or three hundred and sixty,\r\nand of seventy-two other gods proceeding from them, of twenty-one chiefs\r\n([Greek: hegemones]) and forty-two nature-gods ([Greek: theoi\r\ngenesiourgoi]), besides guardian divinities, of particular individuals\r\nand nations. The world is thus peopled by a crowd of superhuman beings\r\ninfluencing natural events, possessing and communicating knowledge of\r\nthe future, and not inaccessible to prayers and offerings.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this complex theory is ruled by a mathematical formulism of\r\ntriad, hebdomad, &c., while the first principle is identified with the\r\nmonad, [Greek: nous] with the dyad, and [Greek: psychê] with the triad,\r\nsymbolic meanings being also assigned to the other numbers. \"The\r\ntheorems of mathematics,\" he says, \"apply absolutely to all things,\"\r\nfrom things divine to original matter ([Greek: hylê]). But though he\r\nthus subjects all things to number, he holds elsewhere that numbers are\r\nindependent existences, and occupy a middle place between the limited\r\nand unlimited.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty of the system is the account given of nature. It is\r\nsaid to be \"bound by the indissoluble chains of necessity which men call\r\nfate,\" as distinguished from divine things which are not subject to\r\nfate. Yet, being itself the result of higher powers becoming corporeal,\r\na continual stream of elevating influence flows from them to it,\r\ninterfering with its necessary laws and turning to good ends the\r\nimperfect and evil. Of evil no satisfactory account is given; it is said\r\nto have been generated accidentally.\r\n\r\nIn his doctrine of man Iamblichus retains for the soul the middle place\r\nbetween intellect and nature which it occupies in the universal order.\r\nHe rejects the passionless and purely intellectual character ascribed to\r\nthe human soul by Plotinus, distinguishing it sharply both from those\r\nabove and those below it. He maintains that it moves between the higher\r\nand lower spheres, that it descends by a necessary law (not solely for\r\ntrial or punishment) into the body, and, passing perhaps from one human\r\nbody to another, returns again to the supersensible. This return is\r\neffected by the virtuous activities which the soul performs through its\r\nown power of free will, and by the assistance of the gods. These virtues\r\nwere classified by Porphyry as political, purifying ([Greek:\r\nkathartikai]), theoretical, and paradigmatic; and to these Iamblichus\r\nadds a fifth class of priestly virtues ([Greek: hieratikai aretai]), in\r\nwhich the divinest part of the soul raises itself above intellect to\r\nabsolute being.\r\n\r\nIamblichus does not seem ever to have attained to that ecstatic\r\ncommunion with and absorption in deity which was the aim of earlier\r\nNeoplatonism, and which Plotinus enjoyed four times in his life,\r\nPorphyry once. Indeed his tendency was not so much to raise man to God\r\nas to bring the gods down to men--a tendency shown still more plainly in\r\nthe \"Answer of Abamon the master to Porphyry's letter to Anebo and\r\nsolutions of the doubts therein expressed,\" afterwards entitled the\r\n_Liber de mysteriis_, and ascribed to Iamblichus.\r\n\r\nIn answer to questions raised and doubts expressed by Porphyry, the\r\nwriter of this treatise appeals to the innate idea all men have of the\r\ngods as testifying to the existence of divinities countless in number\r\nand various in rank (to the correct arrangement of which he, like\r\nIamblichus, attaches the greatest importance). He holds with the latter\r\nthat above all principles of being and intelligence stands the absolute\r\none, from whom the first god and king spontaneously proceeds; while\r\nafter these follow the ethereal, empyrean, and heavenly gods, and the\r\nvarious orders of archangels, angels, demons, and heroes distinguished\r\nin nature, power, and activity, and in greater profusion than even the\r\nimagination of Iamblichus had conceived. He says that all the gods are\r\ngood (though he in another place admits the existence of evil demons who\r\nmust be propitiated), and traces the source of evil to matter; rebuts\r\nthe objection that their answering prayer implies passivity on the part\r\nof gods or demons; defends divination, soothsaying, and theurgic\r\npractices as manifestations of the divine activity; describes the\r\nappearances of the different sorts of divinities; discusses the various\r\nkinds of sacrifice, which he says must be suitable to the different\r\nnatures of the gods, material and immaterial, and to the double\r\ncondition of the sacrificer as bound to the body or free from it\r\n(differing thus in his psychology from Iamblichus); and, in conclusion,\r\nstates that the only way to happiness is through knowledge of and union\r\nwith the gods, and that theurgic practices alone prepare the mind for\r\nthis union--again going beyond his master, who held assiduous\r\ncontemplation of divine things to be sufficient. It is the passionless\r\nnature of the soul which permits it to be thus united to divine\r\nbeings,--knowledge of this mystic union and of the worship associated\r\nwith it having been derived from the Egyptian priests, who learnt it\r\nfrom Hermes.\r\n\r\nOn one point only does the author of the _De mysteriis_ seem not to go\r\nso far as Iamblichus in thus making philosophy subservient to\r\npriestcraft. He condemns as folly and impiety the worship of images of\r\nthe gods, though his master held that these _simulacra_ were filled with\r\ndivine power, whether made by the hand of man or (as he believed) fallen\r\nfrom heaven. But images could easily be dispensed with from the point of\r\nview of the writer, who not only held that all things were full of gods\r\n([Greek: panta plêrê theôn], as Thales said), but thought that each man\r\nhad a special divinity of his own--an [Greek: idios daimôn]--as his\r\nguard and companion.\r\n\r\n  The following are the extant works of Iamblichus: (1) _On the\r\n  Pythagorean_ (_Life_ [Greek: Peri tou Pythagorikou biou]), ed. T.\r\n  Kiessling (1815), A. Nauck (St Petersburg, 1884); for a discussion of\r\n  the authorities used see E. Rohde in _Rheinisches Museum_, xxvi.,\r\n  xxvii. (1871, 1872); Eng. trans. by Thomas Taylor (1818), (2) The\r\n  _Exhortation to Philosophy_ ([Greek: Logos protreptikos eis\r\n  philosophian]), ed. T. Kiessling (1813); H. Piselli (1888). (3) The\r\n  treatise _On the General Science of Mathematics_ ([Greek: Peri tês\r\n  koinês mathêmatkês epistêmês]), ed. J. G. Friis (Copenhagen, 1790), N.\r\n  Festa (Leipzig, 1891). (4) The book _On the Arithmetic of Nicomachus_\r\n  ([Greek: Peri tês Nikomachou arithmêtikês eisagôgês]), along with\r\n  fragments on fate ([Greek: Peri heimarmenês]) and prayer ([Greek: Peri\r\n  euchês]), ed. S. Tennulius (1688), the _Arithmetic_ by H. Pistelli\r\n  (1894). (5) The _Theological Principles of Arithmetic_ ([Greek:\r\n  Theologoumena tês arithmêtikês])--the seventh book of the series--by\r\n  F. Ast (Leipzig, 1817). Two lost books, treating of the physical and\r\n  ethical signification of numbers, stood fifth and sixth, while books\r\n  on music, geometry and astronomy followed. The emperor Julian had a\r\n  great admiration for Iamblichus, whom he considered \"intellectually\r\n  not inferior to Plato\"; but the _Letters to Iamblicus the Philosopher_\r\n  which bear his name are now generally considered spurious.\r\n\r\n  The so-called _Liber de mysteriis_ was first edited, with Latin\r\n  translation and notes, by T. Gale (Oxford, 1678), and more recently by\r\n  C. Parthey (Berlin, 1857); Eng. trans. by Thomas Taylor (1821).\r\n\r\n  There is a monograph on Iamblichus by G. E. Hebenstreit (_De\r\n  Iamblichi, philosophi Syri, doctrina_, Leipzig, 1764), and one of the\r\n  _De myst._ by Harless (_Das Buch v. d. ägypt. Myst._, Munich, 1858).\r\n  The best accounts of Iamblichus are those of Zeller, _Phil. d.\r\n  Griechen_, iii. 2, pp. 613 sq., 2nd ed.; E. Vacherot, _Hist. de\r\n  l'école d'Alexandrie_ (1846), ii. 57 sq.; J. Simon, _Hist. de l'école\r\n  d'Alexandrie_ (1845); A. E.

Gott._, vol. iv., 1781, p.\r\n    77.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIAMBLICHUS, of Syria, the earliest of the Greek romance writers,\r\nflourished in the 2nd century A.D. He was the author of [Greek:\r\nBabylôniaka], the loves of Rhodanes and Sinonis, of which an epitome is\r\npreserved in Photius (cod. 94). Garmus, a legendary king of Babylon,\r\nforces Sinonis to marry him and throws Rhodanes into prison. The lovers\r\nmanage to escape, and after many singular adventures, in which magic\r\nplays a considerable part, Garmus is overthrown by Rhodanes, who becomes\r\nking of Babylon. According to Suidas, Iamblichus was a freedman, and a\r\nscholiast's note on Photius further informs us that he was a native\r\nSyrian (not descended from Greek settlers); that he borrowed the\r\nmaterial for his romance from a love story told him by his Babylonian\r\ntutor, and that he subsequently applied himself with great success to\r\nthe study of Greek. A MS. of the original in the library of the Escorial\r\nis said to have been destroyed by fire in 1670. Only a few fragments\r\nhave been preserved, in addition to Photius's epitome.\r\n\r\n  See _Scriptores erotici_, ed. A. Hirschig (1856) and R. Hercher\r\n  (1858); A. Mai, _Scriptorum veterum nova collectio_, ii.; E. Rohde,\r\n  _Der griechische Roman_ (1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIANNINA (i.e. \"the city of St John\"; Gr. _Ioannina_; Turk _Yaniá_; also\r\nwritten Janina, Jannina, and, according to its Albanian pronunciation,\r\nYanina), the capital of the vilayet of Iannina, Albania, European\r\nTurkey. Pop. (1905) about 22,000. The largest ethnical groups in the\r\npopulation are the Albanian and Greek; the purest form of colloquial\r\nGreek is spoken here among the wealthy and highly educated merchant\r\nfamilies. The position of Iannina is strikingly picturesque. At the foot\r\nof the grey limestone mass of Mount Mitzekeli (1500 ft.), which forms\r\npart of the fine range of hills running north from the Gulf of Arta,\r\nthere lies a valley (the _Hellopia_ of antiquity) partly occupied by a\r\nlake; and the city is built on the slopes of a slight eminence,\r\nstretching down to the western shore. It has greatly declined from the\r\nstate of barbaric prosperity which it enjoyed from 1788 to 1822, when it\r\nwas the seat of Ali Pasha (q.v.), and was estimated to have from 30,000\r\nto 50,000 inhabitants. The fortress--Demir Kule or Iron Castle, which,\r\nlike the principal seraglio, was built on a promontory jutting into the\r\nlake--is now in ruins. But the city is the seat of a Greek archbishop,\r\nand still possesses many mosques and churches, besides synagogues, a\r\nGreek college (gymnasium), a library and a hospital. Sayades (opposite\r\nCorfu) and Arta are the places through which it receives its imports.\r\nThe rich gold and silver embroidery for which the city has long been\r\nfamous is still one of the notable articles in its bazaar; but the\r\ncommercial importance of Iannina has notably declined since the cession\r\nof Arta and Thessaly to Greece in 1881. Iannina had previously been one\r\nof the chief centres of the Thessalian grain trade; it now exports\r\nlittle except cheese, hides, bitumen and sheepskins to the annual value\r\nof about £120,000; the imports, which supply only the local demand for\r\nprovisions, textile goods, hardware, &c., are worth about double that\r\nsum.\r\n\r\nThe lake of Iannina (perhaps to be identified with the Pambotus or\r\nPambotis of antiquity) is 6 m. long, and has an area of 24 sq.m., with\r\nan extreme depth of less than 35 ft. In time of flood it is united with\r\nthe smaller lake of Labchistas to the north. There are no affluents of\r\nany considerable size, and the only outlets are underground passages or\r\n_katavothra_ extending for many miles through the calcareous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe theory supported by W. M. Leake (_Northern Greece_, London, 1835)\r\nthat the citadel of Iannina is to be identified with Dodona, is now\r\ngenerally abandoned in favour of the claims of a more southern site. As\r\nAnna Comnena, in describing the capture of the town ([Greek: ta\r\nIoannina]) by Bohemond in 1082, speaks of the walls as being\r\ndilapidated, it may be supposed that the place existed before the 11th\r\ncentury. It is mentioned from time to time in the Byzantine annals, and\r\non the establishment of the lordship of Epirus by Michael Angelus\r\nComnenus Ducas, it became his capital. In the middle ages it was\r\nsuccessively attacked by Serbs, Macedonians and Albanians; but it was in\r\npossession of the successors of Michael when the forces of the Sultan\r\nMurad appeared before it in 1430 (cf. Hahn, _Alban. Studien_, Jena\r\n[1854], pp. 319-322). Since 1431 it has continued under Turkish rule.\r\n\r\n  Descriptions of Iannina will be found in Holland's _Travels_ (1815);\r\n  Hughes, _Travels in Greece_, &c. (1830); H. F. Tozer, _Researches in\r\n  the Highlands of Turkey_ (London, 1869).

As a\r\npunishment for having revolted against Zeus, he was imprisoned in\r\nTartarus (Homer, _Iliad_, viii. 479) or underneath the island of Inarime\r\noff the coast of Campania (Silius Italicus xii. 148).

Iapetus was\r\nconsidered the original ancestor of the human race, as the father of\r\nPrometheus and grandfather of Deucalion. The name is probably identical\r\nwith Japhet (Japheth), and the son of Noah in the Greek legend of the\r\nflood becomes the ancestor of (Noah) Deucalion. Iapetus as the\r\nrepresentative of an obsolete order of things is described as warring\r\nagainst the new order under Zeus, and is naturally relegated to\r\nTartarus.\r\n\r\n  See F. G. Welcker, _Griechische Götterlehre_, i. (1857); C. H.\r\n  Völcker, _Die Mythologie des Iapetischen Geschlechtes_ (1824); M.\r\n  Mayer, _Giganten und Titanen_ (1887).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIAPYDES, or IAPODES, one of the three chief peoples of Roman Illyria.\r\nThey occupied the interior of the country on the north between the Arsia\r\n(Arsa) and Tedanius (perhaps the Zermanja), which separated them from\r\nthe Liburnians. Their territory formed part of the modern Croatia. They\r\nare described by Strabo as a mixed race of Celts and Illyrians, who used\r\nCeltic weapons, tattooed themselves, and lived chiefly on spelt and\r\nmillet. They were a warlike race, addicted to plundering expeditions. In\r\n129 B.C. C. Sempronius Tuditanus celebrated a triumph over them, and in\r\n34 B.C. they were finally crushed by Augustus. They appear to have had a\r\n_foedus_ with Rome, but subsequently rebelled.\r\n\r\n  See Strabo iv. 207, vii. 313-315; Dio Cassius xlix. 35; Appian,\r\n  _Illyrica_, 10, 14, 16; Livy, _Epit._ lix. 131; Tibullus iv. 1. 108;\r\n  Cicero, _Pro Balbo_, 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIATROCHEMISTRY (coined from Gr. [Greek: iatros], a physician, and\r\n\"chemistry\"), a stage in the history of chemistry, during which the\r\nobject of this science was held to be \"not to make gold but to prepare\r\nmedicines.\" This doctrine dominated chemical thought during the 16th\r\ncentury, its foremost supporters being Paracelsus, van Helmont and de la\r\nBoë Sylvius. But it gave way to the new definition formulated by Boyle,\r\nviz. that the proper domain of chemistry was \"to determine the\r\ncomposition of substances.\" (See CHEMISTRY: I. _History_; MEDICINE.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIAZYGES, a tribe of Sarmatians first heard of on the Maeotis, where they\r\nwere among the allies of Mithradates the Great. Moving westward across\r\nScythia, and hence called Metanastae, they were on the lower Danube by\r\nthe time of Ovid, and about A.D. 50 occupied the plains east of the\r\nTheiss. Here, under the general name of Sarmatae, they were a perpetual\r\ntrouble to the Roman province of Dacia. They were divided into freemen\r\nand serfs (_Sarmatae Limigantes_), the latter of whom had a different\r\nmanner of life and were probably an older settled population enslaved by\r\nnomad masters. They rose against them in A.D. 334, but were repressed by\r\nforeign aid. Nothing is heard of Iazyges or Sarmatae after the Hunnish\r\ninvasions. Graves at Keszthely and elsewhere in the Theiss valley, shown\r\nby their contents to belong to nomads of the first centuries A.D., are\r\nreferred to the Iazyges.     (E. H. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBADAN, a town of British West Africa, in Yorubaland, Southern Nigeria,\r\n123 m. by rail N.E. of Lagos, and about 50 m. N.E. of Abeokuta. Pop.\r\n1910 estimated at 150,000. The town occupies the slope of a hill, and\r\nstretches into the valley through which the river Ona flows. It is\r\nenclosed by mud walls, which have a circuit of 18 m., and is encompassed\r\nby cultivated land 5 or 6 m. in breadth. The native houses are all low,\r\nthatched structures, enclosing a square court, and the only break in the\r\nmud wall is the door. There are numerous mosques, _orishas_\r\n(idol-houses) and open spaces shaded with trees. There are a few\r\nbuildings in the European style. Most of the inhabitants are engaged in\r\nagriculture; but a great variety of handicrafts is also carried on.\r\nIbadan is the capital of one of the Yoruba states and enjoys a large\r\nmeasure of autonomy. Nominally the state is subject to the _alafin_\r\n(ruler) of Oyo; but it is virtually independent. The administration is\r\nin the hands of two chiefs, a civil and a military, the _bale_ and the\r\n_balogun_; these together form the highest court of appeal. There is\r\nalso an _iyaloda_ or mother of the town, to whom are submitted all the\r\ndisputes of the women. Ibadan long had a feud with Abeokuta, but on the\r\nestablishment of the British protectorate the intertribal wars were\r\nstopped. In 1862 the people of Ibadan destroyed Ijaya, a neighbouring\r\ntown of 60,000 inhabitants. A British resident and a detachment of Hausa\r\ntroops are stationed at Ibadan.\r\n\r\n  See also YORUBAS, ABEOKUTA and LAGOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBAGUÉ, or SAN BONIFACIO DE IBAGUÉ, a city of Colombia, and capital of\r\nthe department of Tolima, about 60 m. W. of Bogotá and 18 m. N.W. of the\r\nNevado de Tolima. Pop. (1900, estimate) 13,000. Ibagué is built on a\r\nbeautiful plain between the Chipalo and Combeima, small affluents of the\r\nCuello, a western tributary of the Magdalena. Its elevation, 4300 ft.\r\nabove the sea, gives it a mild, subtropical climate. The plain and the\r\nneighbouring valleys produce cacao, tobacco, rice and sugar-cane. There\r\nare two thermal springs in the vicinity, and undeveloped mines of\r\nsulphur and silver. The city has an endowed college. It is an important\r\ncommercial centre, being on the road which crosses the Quindio pass, or\r\n_paramo_, into the Cauca valley. Ibagué was founded in 1550 and was the\r\ncapital of the republic for a short time in 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBARRA, a city of Ecuador and capital of the province of Imbabura, about\r\n50 m. N.N.E. of Quito, on a small fertile plain at the northern foot of\r\nImbabura volcano, 7300 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1900, estimate) 5000.\r\nIt stands on the left bank of the Tahuando, a small stream whose waters\r\nflow north and west to the Pacific through the Mira, and is separated\r\nfrom the higher plateau of Quito by an elevated transverse ridge of\r\nwhich the Imbabura and Mojanda volcanoes form a part. The surrounding\r\ncountry is mountainous, the valleys being very fertile. Ibarra itself\r\nhas a mild, humid climate, and is set in the midst of orchards and\r\ngardens. It is the see of a bishop and has a large number of churches\r\nand convents, and many substantial residences. Ibarra has manufactures\r\nof cotton and woollen fabrics, hats, sandals (_alpargates_), sacks and\r\nrope from _cabulla_ fibre, laces, sugar and various kinds of distilled\r\nspirits and cordials made from the sugar-cane grown in the vicinity.\r\nMules are bred for the Colombian markets of Pasto and Popayan. Ibarra\r\nwas founded in 1597 by Alvaro de Ibarra, the president of Quito. It has\r\nsuffered from the eruptions of Imbabura, and more severely from\r\nearthquakes, that of 1859 causing great damage to its public buildings,\r\nand the greater one of the 16th of August 1868 almost completely\r\ndestroyed the town and killed a large number of its inhabitants. The\r\nvillage of Carranqui, 1¼ m. from Ibarra, is the birthplace of Atahualpa,\r\nthe Inca sovereign executed by Pizarro, and close by is the small lake\r\ncalled Yaguarcocha where the army of Huaynacapac, the father of\r\nAtahualpa, inflicted a bloody defeat on the Carranquis. Another\r\naboriginal battle-field is that of Hatuntaqui, near Ibarra, where\r\nHuaynacapac won a decisive victory and added the greater part of Ecuador\r\nto his realm. The whole region is full of _tolas_, or Indian burial\r\nmounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBERIANS (Iberi, [Greek: Ibêres]), an ancient people inhabiting parts of\r\nthe Spanish peninsula. Their ethnic affinities are not known, and our\r\nknowledge of their history is comparatively slight. It is almost\r\nimpossible to make any statement in regard to them which will meet with\r\ngeneral agreement. At the same time, the general lines of Iberian\r\ncontroversy are clear enough The principal sources of information about\r\nthe Iberians are (1) historical, (2) numismatic, (3) linguistic, (4)\r\nanthropological.\r\n\r\n1. _Historical._--The name seems to have been applied by the earlier\r\nGreek navigators to the peoples who inhabited the eastern coast of\r\nSpain; probably it originally meant those who dwelt by the river Iberus\r\n(mod. _Ebro_). It is possible (Boudard, _Études sur l'alphabet ibérien_\r\n(Paris, 1852) that the river-name itself represents the Basque phrase\r\n_ibay-erri_ \"the country of the river.\" On the other hand, even in older\r\nGreek usage (as in Thuc. vi. 1) the term Iberia is said to have embraced\r\nthe country as far east as the Rhone (see Herodorus of Heraclea, _Fragm.\r\nHist. Gr._ ii. 34), and by the time of Strabo it was the common Greek\r\nname for the Spanish peninsula. Iberians thus meant sometimes the\r\npopulation of the peninsula in general and sometimes, it would appear,\r\nthe peoples of some definite race ([Greek: genos]) which formed one\r\nelement in that population. Of the tribal distribution of this race, of\r\nits linguistic, social and political characteristics, and of the history\r\nof its relation to the other peoples of Spain, we have only the most\r\ngeneral, fragmentary and contradictory accounts. On the whole, the\r\nhistorical evidence indicates that in Spain, when it first became known\r\nto the Greeks and Romans there existed many separate and variously\r\ncivilized tribes connected by at least apparent identity of race, and by\r\nsimilarity (but not identity) of language, and sufficiently\r\ndistinguished by their general characteristics from Phoenicians, Romans\r\nand Celts. The statement of Diodorus Siculus that the mingling of these\r\nIberians with the immigrant Celts gave rise to the Celtiberians is in\r\nitself probable. Varro and Dionysius Afer proposed to identify the\r\nIberians of Spain with the Iberians of the Caucasus, the one regarding\r\nthe eastern, and other the western, settlements as the earlier.\r\n\r\n2. _Numismatic._--Knowledge of ancient Iberian language and history is\r\nmainly derived from a variety of coins, found widely distributed in the\r\npeninsula,[1] and also in the neighbourhood of Narbonne. They are\r\ninscribed in an alphabet which has many points of similarity with the\r\nwestern Greek alphabets, and some with the Punic alphabet; but which\r\nseems to retain a few characters from an older script akin to those of\r\nMinoan Crete and Roman Libya.[2] The same Iberian alphabet is found also\r\nrarely in inscriptions. The coinage began before the Roman conquest was\r\ncompleted; the monetary system resembles that of the Roman republic,\r\nwith values analogous to _denarii_ and _quinarii_. The coin inscriptions\r\nusually give only the name of the town, e.g. PLPLIS (Bilbilis), KLAQRIQS\r\n(Calagurris), SEQBRICS (Segobriga), TMANIAV (Dumania). The types show\r\nlate Greek and perhaps also late Punic influence, but approximate later\r\nto Roman models. The commonest reverse type, a charging horseman,\r\nreappears on the Roman coins of Bilbilis, Osca, Segobriga and other\r\nplaces. Another common type is one man leading two horses or brandishing\r\na sword or a bow. The obverse has usually a male head, sometimes\r\ninscribed with what appears to be a native name.\r\n\r\n3. _Linguistic._--The survival of the non-Aryan language among the\r\nBasques around the west Pyrenees has suggested the attempt to interpret\r\nby its means a large class of similar-sounding place-names of ancient\r\nSpain, some of which are authenticated by their occurrence on the\r\ninscribed coins, and to link it with other traces of non-Aryan speech\r\nround the shores of the Western Mediterranean and on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard of Europe. This phase of Iberian theory opens with K. W.\r\nHumboldt (_Prüfung der Untersuchungen über die Urbewohner Hispaniens\r\nvermittelst der waskischen Sprache_, Berlin, 1821), who contended that\r\nthere existed once a single great Iberian people, speaking a distinct\r\nlanguage of their own; that an essentially \"Iberian\" population was to\r\nbe found in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, in southern France, and even\r\nin the British Isles; and that the Basques of the present day were\r\nremnants of this race, which had elsewhere been expelled or absorbed.\r\nThis last was the central and the seminal idea of the work, and it has\r\nbeen the point round which the battle of scholarship has mainly raged.\r\nThe principal evidence which Humboldt adduced in its support was the\r\npossibility of explaining a vast number of the ancient topographical\r\nnames of Spain, and of other asserted Iberian districts, by the forms\r\nand significations of Basque. In reply, Graslin (_De l'Ibérie_, Paris,\r\n1839), maintained that the name Iberia was nothing but a Greek misnomer\r\nof Spain, and that there was no proof that the Basque people had ever\r\noccupied a wider area than at present; and Bladé (_Origine des Basques_,\r\nParis, 1869) took the same line of argument, holding that Iberia is a\r\npurely geographical term, that there was no proper Iberian race, that\r\nthe Basques were always shut in by alien races, that their affinity is\r\nstill to seek, and that the whole Basque-Iberian theory is a figment.\r\nHis main contention has met with some acceptance,[3] but the great\r\ncurrent of ethnographical speculation still flows in the direction\r\nindicated by Humboldt.\r\n\r\n4. _Anthropological._--Humboldt's \"Iberian theory\" depended partly on\r\nlinguistic comparisons, but partly on his observation of widespread\r\nsimilarity of physical type among the population of south-western\r\nEurope. Since his time the anthropological researches of Broca, Thurnam\r\nand Davis, Huxley, Busk, Beddoe, Virchow, Tubino and others have proved\r\nthe existence in Europe, from Neolithic times, of a race, small of\r\nstature, with long or oval skulls, and accustomed to bury their dead in\r\ntombs. Their remains have been found in Belgium and France, in Britain,\r\nGermany and Denmark, as well as in Spain; and they bear a close\r\nresemblance to a type which is common among the Basques as well as all\r\nover the Iberian peninsula. This Neolithic race has consequently been\r\nnicknamed \"Iberians,\" and it is now common to speak of the \"Iberian\"\r\nancestry of the people of Britain, recognizing the racial\r\ncharacteristics of \"Iberians\" in the \"small swarthy Welshman,\" the\r\n\"small dark Highlander,\" and the \"Black Celts to the west of the\r\nShannon,\" as well as in the typical inhabitants of Aquitania and\r\nBrittany.[4] Later investigators went further. M. d'Arbois de\r\nJubainville, for example (_Les Premiers habitants de l'Europe_, Paris,\r\n1877), maintained that besides possessing Spain, Gaul, Italy and the\r\nBritish Isles, \"Iberian\" peoples penetrated into the Balkan peninsula,\r\nand occupied a part of northern Africa, Corsica and Sardinia; and it is\r\nnow generally accepted that a race with fairly uniform characteristics\r\nwas at one time in possession of the south of France (or at least of\r\nAquitania), the whole of Spain from the Pyrenees to the straits, the\r\nCanary Islands (the Guanches) a part of northern Africa and Corsica.\r\nWhether this type is more conveniently designated by the word _Iberian_,\r\nor by some other name (\"Eur-african,\" \"Mediterranean,\" &c.) is a matter\r\nof comparative indifference, provided that there is no misunderstanding\r\nas to the steps by which the term _Iberian_ attained its meaning in\r\nmodern anthropology.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--K.

Formerly the\r\nibex was common on the mountain-ranges of Germany, Switzerland and\r\nTirol, but is now confined to the Alps which separate Valais from\r\nPiedmont, and to the lofty peaks of Savoy, where its existence is mainly\r\ndue to game-laws. The ibex is a handsome animal, measuring about 4½ ft.\r\nin length and standing about 40 in. at the shoulder. The skin is covered\r\nin summer with a short fur of an ashy-grey colour, and in winter with\r\nmuch longer yellowish-brown hair concealing a dense fur beneath. The\r\nhorns of the male rise from the crest of the skull, and after bending\r\ngradually backwards terminate in smooth tips; the front surface of the\r\nremainder carrying bold transverse ridges or knots. About 1 yd. is the\r\nmaximum recorded length of ibex-horns. The fact that the fore-legs are\r\nsomewhat shorter than those behind enables the ibex to ascend mountain\r\nslopes with more facility than it can descend, while its hoofs are as\r\nhard as steel, rough underneath and when walking over a flat surface\r\ncapable of being spread out. These, together with its powerful sinews,\r\nenable it to take prodigious leaps, to balance itself on the smallest\r\nfoothold and to scale almost perpendicular rocks. Ibex live habitually\r\nat a greater height than chamois or any other Alpine mammals, their\r\nvertical limit being the line of perpetual snow. There they rest in\r\nsunny nooks during the day, descending at night to the highest woods to\r\ngraze. Ibex are gregarious, feeding in herds of ten to fifteen\r\nindividuals; but the old males generally live apart from, and usually at\r\ngreater elevations than, the females and young. They utter a sharp\r\nwhistling sound not unlike that of the chamois, but when greatly\r\nirritated or frightened make a peculiar snorting noise. The period of\r\ngestation in the female is ninety days, after which she\r\nproduces--usually at the end of June--a single young one which is able\r\nat once to follow its mother. Kids when caught young and fed on goat's\r\nmilk can be readily tamed; and in the 16th century young tamed ibex were\r\nfrequently driven to the mountains along with the goats, in whose\r\ncompany they would afterwards return. Even wild ibex have been known to\r\nstray among the herds of goats, although they shun the society of\r\nchamois. Its flesh is said to resemble mutton, but has a flavour of\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ibex (_Capra ibex_).]\r\n\r\nBy naturalists the name \"ibex\" has been extended to embrace all the\r\nkindred species of wild goats, while by sportsmen it is used in a still\r\nmore elastic sense, to include not only the true wild goat (known in\r\nIndia as the Sind ibex) but even the short-horned _Hemitragus hylocrius_\r\nof the Nilgiris. Dealing only with species zoologically known as ibex,\r\nthe one nearest akin to the European kind is the Asiatic or Siberian\r\nibex (_Capra sibirica_), which, with several local phases, extends from\r\nthe northern side of Kashmir over an enormous area in Central Asia.\r\nThese ibex, especially the race from the Thian Shan, are incomparably\r\nfiner than the European species, their bold knotted horns sometimes\r\nattaining a length of close on 60 in. The Arabian, or Nubian, ibex (_C.\r\nnubiana_) is characterized by the more slender type of horn, in which\r\nthe front edge is much narrower; while the Simien ibex (_C. vali_) of\r\nCentral Abyssinia is a very large and dark-coloured animal, with the\r\nhorns black instead of brownish, and bearing only slightly marked front\r\nridges. The Caucasian ibex (_C. caucasica_), or tur, is a wholly\r\nfox-coloured animal, in which the horns are still flatter in front, and\r\nthus depart yet further from the ibex type. In the Spanish ibex (_C.\r\npyrenaica_) the horns are flattened, with ill-defined knobs, and a\r\nspiral twist. (See GOAT.)     (W. H. F.; R.

James Bruce\r\nidentified this bird with the _Abu-Hannes_ or \"Father John\" of the\r\nAbyssinians, and in 1790 it received from Latham (_Index\r\nornithologicus_, p. 706) the name of _Tantalus aethiopicus_. This\r\ndetermination was placed beyond question by Cuvier (_Ann. du Muséum_,\r\niv. 116-135) and Savigny (_Hist. nat. et mythol. de l'ibis_) in 1805.\r\nThey, however, removed it from the Linnaean genus _Tantalus_ and,\r\nLacépède having some years before founded a genus _Ibis_, it was\r\ntransferred thither, and is now generally known as _I. aethiopica_,\r\nthough some speak of it as _I. religiosa_. No attempt can here be made\r\nto treat the ibis from a mythological or antiquarian point of view.\r\nSavigny's memoir contains a great deal of matter on the subject.\r\nWilkinson (_Ancient Egyptians_, ser. 2, vol. ii. pp. 217-224) added some\r\nof the results of later research, and Renouf in his _Hibbert Lectures_\r\nexplains the origin of the myth.\r\n\r\nThe ibis is chiefly an inhabitant of the Nile basin from Dongola\r\nsouthward, as well as of Kordofan and Sennar; whence about midsummer it\r\nmoves northwards to Egypt.[1] In Lower Egypt it bears the name of\r\n_Abu-mengel_, or \"father of the sickle,\" from the form of its bill, but\r\nit does not stay long in that country, disappearing when the Nile has\r\nsubsided. Hence most travellers have failed to meet with it there[2]\r\n(since their acquaintance with the birds of Egypt is limited to those\r\nwhich frequent the country in winter), and writers have denied generally\r\nto this species a place in its modern fauna (cf. Shelley, _Birds of\r\nEgypt_, p. 261). However, in 1864, von Heuglin (_Journ. für\r\nOrnithologie_, 1865, p. 100) saw a young bird which had been shot in the\r\nDelta, and E. C. Taylor (_Ibis_, 1878, p. 372) saw an adult which had\r\nbeen killed near Lake Menzal in 1877. The story told to Herodotus of its\r\ndestroying snakes is, according to Savigny, devoid of truth, but Cuvier\r\nstates that he discovered partly digested remains of a snake in the\r\nstomach of a mummied ibis.\r\n\r\nThe ibis is somewhat larger than a curlew, _Numenius arquata_, which\r\nbird it resembles, with a much stouter bill and stouter legs. The head\r\nand greater part of the neck are bare and black. The plumage is white,\r\nexcept the primaries, which are black, and a black plume, formed by the\r\nsecondaries, tertials and lower scapulars, and richly glossed with\r\nbronze, blue and green, which curves gracefully over the hind-quarters.\r\nThe bill and feet are also black. The young lack the ornamental plume,\r\nand in them the head and neck are clothed with short black feathers,\r\nwhile the bill is yellow. The nest is placed in bushes or high trees,\r\nthe bird generally building in companies, and in the middle of August\r\nvon Heuglin (_Orn. Nord-Ost-Afrikas_, p. 1138) found that it had from\r\ntwo to four young or much incubated eggs.[3] These are of a dingy white,\r\nsplashed, spotted and speckled with reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nCongeneric with the typical ibis are two or three other species, the _I.\r\nmelanocephala_ of India, the _I. molucca_ or _I. strictipennis_, of\r\nAustralia, and the _I. bernieri_ of Madagascar, all of which closely\r\nresemble _I. aethiopica_; while many other forms not very far removed\r\nfrom it, though placed by authors in distinct genera,[4] are known.\r\nAmong these are several beautiful species such as the Japanese\r\n_Geronticus nippon_, the _Lophotibis cristata_ of Madagascar, and the\r\nscarlet ibis,[5] _Eudocimus ruber_, of America. The glossy ibis,\r\n_Plegadis falcinellus_, found throughout the West Indies, Central and\r\nthe south-eastern part of North America, as well as in many parts of\r\nEurope (whence it not unfrequently strays to the British Islands),\r\nAfrica, Asia and Australia. This bird, believed to be the second kind of\r\nibis spoken of by Herodotus, is rather smaller than the sacred ibis, and\r\nmostly of a dark chestnut colour with brilliant green and purple\r\nreflections on the upper parts, exhibiting, however, when young none of\r\nthe rufous hue. This species lays eggs of a deep sea-green colour,\r\nhaving wholly the character of heron's eggs, and it often breeds in\r\ncompany with herons, while the eggs of all other ibises whose eggs are\r\nknown resemble those of the sacred ibis. Though ibises resemble the\r\ncurlews externally, there is no affinity between them. The _Ibididae_\r\nare more nearly related to the storks, _Ciconiidae_, and still more to\r\nthe spoonbills, _Plataleidae_, with which latter many systematists\r\nconsider them to form one group, the _Hemiglottides_ of Nitzsch.\r\nTogether these groups form the sub-order _Ciconiae_ of the order\r\n_Ciconiiformes_. The true ibises are also to be clearly separated from\r\nthe wood-ibises, _Tantalidae_, of which there are four or five species,\r\nby several not unimportant structural characters. Fossil remains of a\r\ntrue ibis, _I. pagana_, have been found in considerable numbers in the\r\nmiddle Tertiary beds of France.[6]     (A. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] It has been said to occur occasionally in Europe (Greece and\r\n    southern Russia).\r\n\r\n  [2] E. C. Taylor remarked (_Ibis_, 1859, p. 51), that the buff-backed\r\n    heron, _Ardea bubulcus_, was made by the tourists' dragomans to do\r\n    duty for the \"sacred ibis,\" and this seems to be no novel practice,\r\n    since by it, or something like it, Hasselqvist was misled, and\r\n    through him Linnaeus.\r\n\r\n  [3] The ibis has more than once nested in the gardens of the\r\n    Zoological Society in London, and even reared its young there.\r\n\r\n  [4] For some account of these may be consulted Dr Reichenow's paper\r\n    in _Journ. für Ornithologie_ (1877), pp. 143-156; Elliot's in _Proc.\r\n    Zool. Society_ (1877), pp. 477-510; and that of Oustalet in _Nouv.\r\n    Arch. du Muséum_, ser. 2, vols. i. pp. 167-184.\r\n\r\n  [5] It is a popular error--especially among painters--that this bird\r\n    was the sacred ibis of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n  [6] The name \"_Ibis_\" was selected as the title of an ornithological\r\n    magazine, frequently referred to in this and other articles, which\r\n    made its first appearance in 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBLIS, or EBLIS, in Moslem mythology the counterpart of the Christian\r\nand Jewish devil. He figures oftener in the Koran under the name\r\nShaitan, Iblis being mentioned 11 times, whereas Shaitan appears in 87\r\npassages. He is chief of the spirits of evil, and his personality is\r\nadapted to that of his Jewish prototype. Iblis rebelled against Allah\r\nand was expelled from Paradise. The Koranic legend is that his fall was\r\na punishment for his refusal to worship Adam. Condemned to death he was\r\nafterwards respited till the judgment day (Koran vii. 13).\r\n\r\n  See Gustav Weil, _The Bible, the Koran and the Talmud_ (London, 1846).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN 'ABD RABBIHI [Abu 'Umar Ahmad ibn Mahommed ibn 'Abd Rabbihi]\r\n(860-940), Arabian poet, was born in Cordova and descended from a freed\r\nslave of Hisham, the second Spanish Omayyad caliph. He enjoyed a great\r\nreputation for learning and eloquence. No diwan of his is extant, but\r\nmany selections from his poems are given in the _Yatimat ud-Dahr_, i.\r\n412-436 (Damascus, 1887). More widely known than his poetry is his great\r\nanthology, the _'Iqd ul-Farid_ (\"The Precious Necklace\"), a work divided\r\ninto twenty-five sections, the thirteenth being named the middle jewel\r\nof the necklace, the chapters on either side of this being named after\r\nother jewels. It is an _adab_ book (see ARABIA: _Literature_, section\r\n\"Belles Lettres\") resembling Ibn Qutaiba's _'Uyun ul-Akhbar_, from which\r\nit borrows largely. It has been printed, several times in Cairo (1876,\r\n1886, &c.).     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN 'ARABI [Muhyiuddin Abu 'Abdallah ibn ul-'Arabi] (1165-1240), Moslem\r\ntheologian and mystic, was born in Murcia and educated in Seville. When\r\nthirty-eight he travelled in Egypt, Arabia, Bagdad, Mosul and Asia\r\nMinor, after which he lived in Damascus for the rest of his life. In law\r\nhe was a Zahirite, in theology a mystic of the extreme order, though\r\nprofessing orthodox Ash'arite theology and combating in many points the\r\nIndo-Persian mysticism (pantheism). He claims to have had conversations\r\nwith all the prophets past and future, and reports conversations with\r\nGod himself. Of his numerous works about 150 still exist. The most\r\nextensive is the twelve-volume _Futuhat ul-Makkiyat_ (\"Meccan\r\nRevelations\"), a general encyclopaedia of Sufic beliefs and doctrines.\r\nNumerous extracts from this work are contained in Sha'rani's (d. 1565)\r\nmanual of Sufic dogma (_Yawaqit_) published several times in Cairo. A\r\nshort account of these works is given in A. von Kremer's _Geschichte der\r\nherrschenden Ideen des Islams_, pp. 102-109 (Leipzig, 1868). Another\r\ncharacteristic and more accessible work of Ibn 'Arabi is the _Fusus\r\nul-Hikam_, on the nature and importance of the twenty-seven chief\r\nprophets, written in 1230 (ed. Bulaq, 1837) and with the _Commentary_\r\n(Cairo, 1891) of Qashani (d. 1350); cf. analysis by M. Schreiner in\r\n_Journal of German Oriental Society_, lii. 516-525.\r\n\r\n  Of some 289 works said to have been written by Ibn 'Arabi 150 are\r\n  mentioned in C. Brockelmann's _Gesch. der arabischen Litteratur_, vol.\r\n  i. (Weimar, 1898), pp. 441-448. See also R. A. Nicholson, _A Literary\r\n  History of the Arabs_, pp. 399-404 (London, 1907).     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN ATHIR, the family name of three brothers, all famous in Arabian\r\nliterature, born at Jazirat ibn 'Umar in Kurdistan. The eldest brother,\r\nknown as MAJD UD-DIN (1149-1210), was long in the service of the amir of\r\nMosul, and was an earnest student of tradition and language. His\r\ndictionary of traditions (_Kitab un-Nihaya_) was published at Cairo\r\n(1893), and his dictionary of family names (_Kitab ul-Murassa'_) has\r\nbeen edited by Seybold (Weimar, 1896). The youngest brother, known as\r\nDIYA UD-DIN (1163-1239), served Saladin from 1191 on, then his son,\r\nal-Malik ul-Afdal, and was afterwards in Egypt, Samosata, Aleppo, Mosul\r\nand Bagdad. He was one of the most famous aesthetic and stylistic\r\ncritics in Arabian literature. His _Kitab ul-Mathal_, published in Bulaq\r\nin 1865 (cf. _Journal of the German Oriental Society_, xxxv. 148, and\r\nGoldziher's _Abhandlungen_, i. 161 sqq.), contains some very\r\nindependent criticism of ancient and modern Arabic verse. Some of his\r\nletters have been published by D. S. Margoliouth \"On the Royal\r\nCorrespondence of Diya ed-Din el-Jazari\" in the _Actes du dixième\r\ncongrès international des orientalistes_, sect. 3, pp. 7-21.\r\n\r\nThe brother best known by the simple name of Ibn Athir was ABU-L-HASAN\r\n'IZZUDDIN MAHOMMED IBN UL-ATHIR (1160-1234), who devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of history and tradition. At the age of twenty-one he settled with\r\nhis father in Mosul and continued his studies there. In the service of\r\nthe amir for many years, he visited Bagdad and Jerusalem and later\r\nAleppo and Damascus. He died in Mosul. His great history, the _Kamil_,\r\nextends to the year 1231; it has been edited by C. J. Tornberg, _Ibn\r\nal-Athiri Chronicon quod perfectissimum inscribitur_ (14 vols., Leiden,\r\n1851-1876), and has been published in 12 vols. in Cairo (1873 and 1886).\r\nThe first part of this work up to A.H. 310 (A.D. 923) is an abbreviation\r\nof the work of Tabari (q.v.) with additions. Ibn Athir also wrote a\r\nhistory of the Atabegs of Mosul, published in the _Recueil des\r\nhistoriens des croisades_ (vol. ii., Paris); a work (_Usd ul-Ghaba_),\r\ngiving an account of 7500 companions of Mahomet (5 vols., Cairo, 1863),\r\nand a compendium (the _Lubab_) of Sam'ani's _Kitab ul-Ansab_ (cf. F.\r\nWüstenfeld's _Specimen el-Lobabi_, Göttingen, 1835).     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN BATUTA, i.e. ABU ABDULLAH MAHOMMED, surnamed IBN BATUTA (1304-1378),\r\nthe greatest of Moslem travellers, was born at Tangier in 1304. He\r\nentered on his travels at twenty-one (1325) and closed them in 1355. He\r\nbegan by traversing the coast of the Mediterranean from Tangier to\r\nAlexandria, finding time to marry two wives on the road. After some stay\r\nat Cairo, then probably the greatest city in the world (excluding\r\nChina), and an unsuccessful attempt to reach Mecca from Aidhab on the\r\nwest coast of the Red Sea, he visited Palestine, Aleppo and Damascus. He\r\nthen made the pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, and visited the shrine of\r\nAli at Mashhad-Ali, travelling thence to Basra, and across the mountains\r\nof Khuzistan to Isfahan, thence to Shiraz and back to Kufa and Bagdad.\r\nAfter an excursion to Mosul and Diarbekr, he made the _haj_ a second\r\ntime, staying at Mecca three years. He next sailed down the Red Sea to\r\nAden (then a place of great trade), the singular position of which he\r\ndescribes, noticing its dependence for water-supply upon the great\r\ncisterns restored in modern times. He continued his voyage down the\r\nAfrican coast, visiting, among other places, Mombasa and Quiloa (Kilwa).\r\nReturning north he passed by the chief cities of Oman to New Ormuz\r\n(Hurmuz), which had about 15 years before, c. 1315, been transferred to\r\nits famous island-site from the mainland (Old Ormuz). After visiting\r\nother parts of the gulf he crossed the breadth of Arabia to Mecca,\r\nmaking the _haj_ for the third time. Crossing the Red Sea, he made a\r\njourney of great hardship to Syene, and thence along the Nile to Cairo.\r\nAfter this, travelling through Syria, he made a circuit among the petty\r\nTurkish states into which Asia Minor was divided after the fall of the\r\nkingdom of Rum (Iconium). He now crossed the Black Sea to Kaffa, then\r\nmainly occupied by the Genoese, and apparently the first Christian city\r\nhe had seen, for he was much perturbed by the bell-ringing. He next\r\ntravelled into Kipchak (the Mongol khanate of Russia), and joined the\r\ncamp of the reigning khan Mahommed Uzbeg, from whom the great and\r\nheterogeneous _Uzbeg_ race is perhaps named. Among other places in this\r\nempire he travelled to Bolghar (54° 54´ N.) in order to witness the\r\nshortness of the summer night, and desired to continue his travels north\r\ninto the \"Land of Darkness\" (in the extreme north of Russia), of which\r\nwonderful things were told, but was obliged to forego this. Returning to\r\nthe khan's camp he joined the cortège of one of the Khatuns, who was a\r\nGreek princess by birth (probably illegitimate) and in her train\r\ntravelled to Constantinople, where he had an interview with the emperor\r\nAndronikos III. the Younger (1328-1341). He tells how, as he passed the\r\ncity gates, he heard the guards muttering _Sarakinu_. Returning to the\r\ncourt of Uzbeg, at Sarai on the Volga, he crossed the steppes to\r\nKhwarizm and Bokhara; thence through Khorasan and Kabul, and over the\r\nHindu Kush (to which he gives that name, its first occurrence). He\r\nreached the Indus, on his own statement, in September, 1333. This\r\ncloses the first part of his narrative.\r\n\r\nFrom Sind, which he traversed to the sea and back again, he proceeded to\r\nMultan, and eventually, on the invitation of Mahommed Tughlak, the\r\nreigning sovereign, to Delhi. Mahommed was a singular character, full of\r\npretence at least to many accomplishments and virtues, the founder of\r\npublic charities, and a profuse patron of scholars, but a parricide, a\r\nfratricide, and as madly capricious, bloodthirsty and unjust as\r\nCaligula. \"No day did his palace gate fail to witness the elevation of\r\nsome abject to affluence and the torture and murder of some living\r\nsoul.\" He appointed the traveller to be kazi of Delhi, with a present of\r\n12,000 silver dinars (rupees), and an annual salary of the same amount,\r\nbesides an assignment of village lands. In the sultan's service Ibn\r\nBatuta remained eight years; but his good fortune stimulated his natural\r\nextravagance, and his debts soon amounted to four or five times his\r\nsalary. At last he fell into disfavour and retired from court, only to\r\nbe summoned again on a congenial duty. The emperor of China, last of the\r\nMongol dynasty, had sent a mission to Delhi, and the Moor was to\r\naccompany the return embassy (1342). The party travelled through central\r\nIndia to Cambay and thence sailed to Calicut, classed by the traveller\r\nwith the neighbouring Kaulam (Quilon), Alexandria, Sudak in the Crimea,\r\nand Zayton (Amoy harbour) in China, as one of the greatest trading\r\nhavens in the world--an interesting enumeration from one who had seen\r\nthem all. The mission party was to embark in Chinese junks (the word\r\nused) and smaller vessels, but that carrying the other envoys and the\r\npresents, which started before Ibn Batuta was ready, was wrecked\r\ntotally; the vessel that he had engaged went off with his property, and\r\nhe was left on the beach of Calicut. Not daring to return to Delhi, he\r\nremained about Honore and other cities of the western coast, taking part\r\nin various adventures, among others the capture of Sindabur (Goa), and\r\nvisiting the Maldive Islands, where he became kazi, and married four\r\nwives, and of which he has left the best medieval account, hardly\r\nsurpassed by any modern. In August 1344 he left the Maldives for Ceylon;\r\nhere he made the pilgrimage to the \"Footmark of our Father Adam.\" Thence\r\nhe betook himself to Maabar (the Coromandel coast), where he joined a\r\nMussulman adventurer, residing at Madura, who had made himself master of\r\nmuch of that region. After once more visiting Malabar, Canara and the\r\nMaldives, he departed for Bengal, a voyage of forty-three days, landing\r\nat Sadkawan (Chittagong). In Bengal he visited the famous Moslem saint\r\nShaykh Jalaluddin, whose shrine (_Shah Jalal_ at Silhet) is still\r\nmaintained. Returning to the delta, he took ship at Sunarganw (near\r\nDacca) on a junk bound for Java (i.e. _Java Minor_ of Marco Polo, or\r\nSumatra). Touching the coast of Arakan or Burma, he reached Sumatra in\r\nforty days, and was provided with a junk for China by Malik al Dhahir, a\r\nzealous disciple of Islam, which had recently spread among the states on\r\nthe northern coast of that island. Calling (apparently) at Cambodia on\r\nhis way, Ibn Batuta reached China at Zayton (Amoy harbour), famous from\r\nMarco Polo; he also visited Sin Kalan or Canton, and professes to have\r\nbeen in Khansa (_Kinsay_ of Marco Polo, i.e. Hangchau), and Khanbalik\r\n(_Cambaluc_ or Peking). The truth of his visit to these two cities, and\r\nespecially to the last, has been questioned. The traveller's history,\r\nnot least in China, singularly illustrates the free masonry of Islam,\r\nand its power of carrying a Moslem doctor over the known world of Asia\r\nand Africa. On his way home he saw the great bird _Rukh_ (evidently,\r\nfrom his description, an island lifted by refraction); revisited\r\nSumatra, Malabar, Oman, Persia, Bagdad, and crossed the great desert to\r\nPalmyra and Damascus, where he got his first news of home, and heard of\r\nhis father's death fifteen years before. Diverging to Hamath and Aleppo,\r\non his return to Damascus, he found the Black Death raging, so that two\r\nthousand four hundred died in one day. Revisiting Jerusalem and Cairo he\r\nmade the _haj_ a fourth time, and finally reappeared at Fez (visiting\r\nSardinia _en route_) on the 8th of November 1349, after twenty-four\r\nyears' absence. Morocco, he felt, was, after all, the best of countries.\r\n\"The _dirhems_ of the West are but little; but then you get more for\r\nthem.\" After going home to Tangier, Ibn Batuta crossed into Spain and\r\nmade the round of Andalusia, including Gibraltar, which had just then\r\nstood a siege from the \"Roman tyrant Adfunus\" (Alphonso XI. of Castile,\r\n1312-1350). In 1352 the restless man started for Central Africa, passing\r\nby the oases of the Sahara (where the houses were built of rock-salt, as\r\nHerodotus tells, and roofed with camel skins) to Timbuktu and Gogo on\r\nthe Niger, a river which he calls the Nile, believing it to flow down\r\ninto Egypt, an opinion maintained by some up to the date of Lander's\r\ndiscovery. Being then recalled by his own king, he returned to Fez\r\n(early in 1354) via Takadda, Haggar and Tuat. Thus ended his\r\ntwenty-eight years' wanderings which in their main lines alone exceeded\r\n75,000 m. By royal order he dictated his narrative to Mahommed Ibn\r\nJuzai, who concludes the work, 13th of December 1355 (A.D.) with the\r\ndeclaration: \"This Shaykh is the traveller of our age; and he who should\r\ncall him the traveller of the whole body of Islam would not exceed the\r\ntruth.\" Ibn Batuta died in 1378, aged seventy-three.\r\n\r\n  Ibn Batuta's travels have only been known in Europe during the 19th\r\n  century; at first merely by Arabic abridgments in the Gotha and\r\n  Cambridge libraries. Notices or extracts had been published by Seetzen\r\n  (c. 1808), Kosegarten (1818), Apetz (1819), and Burckhardt (1819),\r\n  when in 1829 Dr S. Lee published for the Oriental Translation Fund a\r\n  version from the abridged MSS. at Cambridge, which attracted much\r\n  interest. The French capture of Constantina afforded MSS. of the\r\n  complete work, one of them the autograph of Ibn Juzai. And from these,\r\n  after versions of fragments by various French scholars, was derived at\r\n  last (1858-1859) the standard edition and translation of the whole by\r\n  M. Défrémery and Dr Sanguinetti, in 4 vols. See also Sir Henry Yule,\r\n  Cathay, ii. 397-526; C. Raymond Beazley, _Dawn of Modern Geography_,\r\n  iii. 535-538. Though there are some singular chronological\r\n  difficulties in the narrative, and a good many cursory inaccuracies\r\n  and exaggerations, there is no part of it except, perhaps, certain\r\n  portions of the journeys in north China, which is open to doubt. The\r\n  accounts of the Maldive Islands, and of the Negro countries on the\r\n  Niger, are replete with interesting and accurate particulars. The\r\n  former agrees surprisingly with that given by the only other foreign\r\n  resident we know of, Pyrard de la Val, two hundred and fifty years\r\n  later. Ibn Batuta's statements and anecdotes regarding the showy\r\n  virtues and solid vices of Sultan Muhammad Tughlak are in entire\r\n  agreement with Indian historians, and add many fresh details.\r\n       (H. Y.; C. R. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN DURAID [Abu Bakr Mahommed ibn ul-Hasan ibn Duraid ul-Azdi]\r\n(837-934), Arabian poet and philologist, was born at Basra of south\r\nArabian stock. At his native place he was trained under various\r\nteachers, but fled in 871 to Oman at the time Basra was attacked by the\r\nnegroes, known as the Zanj, under Muhallabi. After living twelve years\r\nin Oman he went to Persia, and, under the protection of the governor,\r\n'Abdallah ibn Mahommed ibn Mikal, and his son, Isma'il, wrote his chief\r\nworks. In 920 he went to Bagdad, where he received a pension from the\r\ncaliph Moqtadir.\r\n\r\n  The _Maqsura_, a poem in praise of Ibn Mikal and his son, has been\r\n  edited by A. Haitsma (1773) E. Scheidius (1786) and N. Boyesen (1828).\r\n  Various commentaries on the poem exist in MS. (cf. C. Brockelmann,\r\n  _Gesch. der ar. Lit._, i. 211 ff., Weimar, 1898), The _Jamhara\r\n  fi-l-Lugha_ is a large dictionary written in Persian but not printed.\r\n  Another work is the _Kitab ul-Ishtiqaq_ (\"Book of Etymology\"), edited\r\n  by F. Wüstenfeld (Göttingen, 1854); it was written in opposition to\r\n  the anti-Arabian party to show the etymological connexion of the\r\n  Arabian tribal names.     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN FARADI [Abu-l-Walid 'Abdallah ibn ul-Faradi] (962-1012), Arabian\r\nhistorian, was born at Cordova and studied law and tradition. In 992 he\r\nmade the pilgrimage and proceeded to Egypt and Kairawan, studying in\r\nthese places. After his return in 1009 he became cadi in Valencia, and\r\nwas killed at Cordova when the Berbers took the city.\r\n\r\n  His chief work is the _History of the Learned Men of Andalusia_,\r\n  edited by F. Codera (Madrid, 1891-1892). He wrote also a history of\r\n  the poets of Andalusia.     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN FARID [Abu-l-Qasim 'Umar ibn ul-Farid] (1181-1235), Arabian poet,\r\nwas born in Cairo, lived for some time in Mecca and died in Cairo. His\r\npoetry is entirely Sufic, and he was esteemed the greatest mystic poet\r\nof the Arabs. Some of his poems are said to have been written in\r\necstasies. His diwan has been published with commentary at Beirut, 1887,\r\n&c.; with the commentaries of Burini (d. 1615) and 'Abdul-Ghani (d.\r\n1730) at Marseilles, 1853, and at Cairo; and with the commentary of\r\nRushayyid Ghalib (19th century) at Cairo, 1893. One of the separate\r\npoems was edited by J. von Hammer Purgstall as _Das arabische hohe Lied\r\nder Liebe_ (Vienna, 1854).\r\n\r\n  See R. A. Nicholson, _A Literary History of the Arabs_ (London, 1907),\r\n  pp. 394-398.     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN GABIROL [SOLOMON BEN JUDAH], Jewish poet and philosopher, was born\r\nat Malaga, probably about 1021. The early part of his troublous life was\r\nspent at Saragossa, but few personal details of it are recorded. His\r\nparents died while he was a child and he was under the protection first\r\nof a certain Jekuthiel, who died in 1039, and afterwards of Samuel\r\nha-Nagid, the well-known patron of learning. His passionate disposition,\r\nhowever, embittered no doubt by his misfortunes, involved him in\r\nfrequent difficulties and led to his quarrelling with Samuel. It is\r\ngenerally agreed that he died young, although the date is uncertain. Al\r\nHarizi[1] says at the age of twenty-nine, and Moses b. Ezra[2] about\r\nthirty, but Abraham Zaccuto[3] states that he died (at Valencia) in\r\n1070. M. Steinschneider[4] accepts the date 1058.\r\n\r\nHis literary activity began early. He is said to have composed poems at\r\nthe age of sixteen, and elegies by him are extant on Hai Gaon (died in\r\n1038) and Jekuthiel (died in 1039), each of which was written probably\r\nsoon after the death of the person commemorated. About the same time he\r\nalso wrote his _'Anaq_, a poem on grammar, of which only 97 lines out of\r\n400 are preserved. Moses ben Ezra says of him that he imitated Moslem\r\nmodels, and was the first to open to Jewish poets the door of\r\nversification,[5] meaning that he first popularized the use of Arabic\r\nmetres in Hebrew. It is as a poet that he has been known to the Jews to\r\nthe present day, and admired for the youthful freshness and beauty of\r\nhis work, in which he may be compared to the romantic school in France\r\nand England in the early 19th century. Besides his lyrical and satirical\r\npoems, he contributed many of the finest compositions to the liturgy\r\n(some of them with the acrostic \"Shelomoh ha-qato\"), which are widely\r\ndifferent from the artificial manner of the earlier payyetanim. The best\r\nknown of his longer liturgical compositions are the philosophical\r\n_Kether Malkuth_ (for the Day of Atonement) and the _Azharoth_, on the\r\n613 precepts (for _Shebhu'oth_). Owing to his pure biblical style he had\r\nan abiding influence on subsequent liturgical writers.\r\n\r\nOutside the Jewish community he was known as the philosopher Avicebron\r\n(Avencebrol, Avicebrol, &c.) The credit of identifying this name as a\r\nmedieval corruption of Ibn Gabirol is due to S. Munk, who showed that\r\nselections made by Shem Tobh Palqera (or Falqera) from the Meqor Hayyim\r\n(the Hebrew translation of an Arabic original) by Ibn Gabirol,\r\ncorresponded to the Latin _Fons Vitae_ of Avicebron. The Latin version,\r\nmade by Johannes Hispalensis and Gundisalvi about one hundred years\r\nafter the author's death, had at once become known among the Schoolmen\r\nof the 12th century and exerted a powerful influence upon them, although\r\nso little was known of the author that it was doubted whether he was a\r\nChristian or a Moslem. The teaching of the _Fons Vitae_ was entirely new\r\nto the country of its origin, and being drawn largely from Neoplatonic\r\nsources could not be expected to find favour with Jewish thinkers. Its\r\ndistinctive doctrines are: (1) that all created beings, spiritual or\r\ncorporeal, are composed of matter and form, the various species of\r\nmatter being but varieties of the universal matter, and similarly all\r\nforms being contained in one universal form; (2) that between the primal\r\nOne and the intellect (the [Greek: nous] of Plotinus) there is\r\ninterposed the divine Will, which is itself divine and above the\r\ndistinction of form and matter, but is the cause of their union in the\r\nbeing next to itself, the intellect, in which Avicebron holds that the\r\ndistinction does exist. The doctrine that there is a material, as well\r\nas a formal, element in all created beings was explicitly adopted from\r\nAvicebron by Duns Scotus (as against the view of Albertus Magnus and\r\nThomas Aquinas), and perhaps his exaltation of the will above the\r\nintellect is due to the same influence. Avicebron develops his\r\nphilosophical system throughout quite independently of his religious\r\nviews--a practice wholly foreign to Jewish teachers, and one which could\r\nnot be acceptable to them. Indeed, this charge is expressly brought\r\nagainst him by Abraham ben David of Toledo (died in 1180). It is\r\ndoubtless this non-religious attitude which accounts for the small\r\nattention paid to the _Fons Vitae_ by the Jews, as compared with the\r\nwide influence of the philosophy of Maimonides.\r\n\r\nThe other important work of Ibn Gabirol is _Islah al-akhlaq_ (the\r\nimprovement of character), a popular work in Arabic, translated into\r\nHebrew (_Tiqqun middoth ha-nephesh_) by Judah ibn Tibbon. It is widely\r\ndifferent in treatment from the _Fons_, being intended as a practical\r\nnot a speculative work.\r\n\r\nThe collection of moral maxims, compiled in Arabic but best known (in\r\nthe Hebrew translation of Judah ibn Tibbon) as _Mibhar ha-peninim_, is\r\ngenerally ascribed to Ibn Gabirol, though on less certain grounds.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Texts of the liturgical poems are to be found in the\r\n  prayer-books: others in Dukes and Edelmann, _Treasures of Oxford_\r\n  (Oxford, 1850); Dukes, _Shire Shelomoh_ (Hanover, 1858); S.

His work on geography, written in 977, is\r\nonly a revision and extension of the _Masalik ul-Mamalik_ of\r\nal-Istakhri, who wrote in 951. This itself was a revised edition of the\r\n_Kitab ul-Ashkal_ or _Suwar ul-Aqalim_ of Abu Zaid ul-Balkhi, who wrote\r\nabout 921. Ibn Haukal's work was published by M. J. de Goeje (Leiden,\r\n1873). An anonymous epitome of the book was written in 1233.\r\n\r\n  See M. J. de Goeje, \"Die Istahri-Balhi Frage,\" in the _Zeitschrift der\r\n  deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft_, xxv. 42 sqq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN HAZM [Abu Mahommed 'Ali ibn Ahmad ibn Hazm] (994-1064), Moslem\r\ntheologian, was born in a suburb of Cordova. He studied history, law and\r\ntheology, and became a vizier as his father had been before him, but was\r\ndeposed for heresy, and spent the rest of his life quietly in the\r\ncountry. In legal matters he belonged first to the Shafi'ite school, but\r\ncame to adopt the views of the Zahirites, who admitted only the external\r\nsense of the Koran and tradition, disallowing the use of analogy\r\n(_Qiyas_) and _Taqlid_ (appeal to the authority of an imam), and\r\nobjecting altogether to the use of individual opinion (_Ra'y_). Every\r\nsentence of the Koran was to be interpreted in a general and universal\r\nsense; the special application to the circumstances of the time it was\r\nwritten was denied. Every word of the Koran was to be taken in a literal\r\nsense, but that sense was to be learned from other uses in the Koran\r\nitself, not from the meaning in other literature of the time. The\r\nspecial feature of Ibn Hazm's teaching was that he extended the\r\napplication of these principles from the study of law to that of\r\ndogmatic theology. He thus found himself in opposition at one time to\r\nthe Mo'tazilites, at another to the Ash'arites. He did not, however,\r\nsucceed in forming a school. His chief work is the _Kitab ul-Milal\r\nwan-Nihal_, or \"Book of Sects\" (published in Cairo, 1899).\r\n\r\n  For his teaching cf. I. Goldziher, _Die Zahiriten_, pp. 116-172\r\n  (Leipzig, (1884), and M. Schreiner in the _Journal of the German\r\n  Oriental Society_, lii. 464-486. For a list of his other works see C.\r\n  Brockelmann's _Geschichte der arabischen Literatur_, vol. i. (Weimar,\r\n  1898), p. 400.     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN HISHAM [Abu Mahommed 'Abdulmalik ibn Hisham ibn Ayyub ul-Himyari]\r\n(d. 834), Arabian biographer, studied in Kufa but lived afterwards in\r\nFostat (old Cairo), where he gained a name as a grammarian and student\r\nof language and history. His chief work is his edition of Ibn Ishaq's\r\n(q.v.) _Life of the Apostle of God_, which has been edited by F.\r\nWüstenfeld (Göttingen, 1858-1860). An abridged German translation has\r\nbeen made by G. Weil (Stuttgart, 1864; cf. P. Brönnle, _Die\r\nCommentatoren des Ibn Ishaq und ihre Scholien_, Halle, 1895). Ibn Hisham\r\nis said to have written a work explaining the difficult words which\r\noccur in poems on the life of the Apostle, and another on the\r\ngenealogies of the Himyarites and their princes.     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN ISHAQ [Mahommed ibn Ishaq Abu 'Abdallah] (d. 768), Arabic historian,\r\nlived in Medina, where he interested himself to such an extent in the\r\ndetails of the Prophet's life that he was attacked by those to whom his\r\nwork seemed to have a rationalistic tendency. He consequently left\r\nMedina in 733, and went to Alexandria, then to Kufa and Hira, and\r\nfinally to Bagdad, where the caliph Mansur provided him with the means\r\nof writing his great work. This was the _Life of the Apostle of God_,\r\nwhich is now lost and is known to us only in the recension of Ibn Hisham\r\n(q.v.). The work has been attacked by Arabian writers (as in the\r\n_Fihrist_) as untrustworthy, and it seems clear that he introduced\r\nforged verses (cf. _Journal of the German Oriental Society_, xiv. 288\r\nsqq.). It remains, however, one of the most important works of the age.\r\n     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN JUBAIR [Abu-l Husain Mahommed ibn Ahmad ibn Jubair] (1145-1217),\r\nArabian geographer, was born in Valencia. At Granada he studied the\r\nKoran, tradition, law and literature, and later became secretary to the\r\nMohad governor of that city. During this time he composed many poems. In\r\n1183 he left the court and travelled to Alexandria, Jerusalem, Medina,\r\nMecca, Damascus, Mosul and Bagdad, returning in 1185 by way of Sicily.\r\n\r\n  The _Travels of Ibn Jubair_ were edited by W. Wright (Leiden, 1852);\r\n  and a new edition of this text, revised by M. J. de Goeje, was\r\n  published by the Gibb Trustees (London, 1907). The part relating to\r\n  Sicily was published, with French translation and notes, by M. Amari\r\n  in the _Journal asiatique_ (1845-1846) and a French translation alone\r\n  of the same part by G. Crolla in _Museon_, vi. 123-132.     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN KHALDUN [Abu Zaid ibn Mahommed ibn Mahommed ibn Khaldun]\r\n(1332-1406), Arabic historian, was born at Tunis. He studied the various\r\nbranches of Arabic learning with great success. In 1352 he obtained\r\nemployment under the Marinid sultan Abu Inan (Faris I.) at Fez. In the\r\nbeginning of 1356, his integrity having been suspected, he was thrown\r\ninto prison until the death of Abu Inan in 1358, when the vizier\r\nal-Hasan ibn Omar set him at liberty and reinstated him in his rank and\r\noffices. He here continued to render great service to Abu Salem (Ibrahim\r\nIII.), Abu Inan's successor, but, having offended the prime minister, he\r\nobtained permission to emigrate to Spain, where, at Granada, he was\r\nreceived with great cordiality by Ibn al Ahmar, who had been greatly\r\nindebted to his good offices when an exile at the court of Abu Salem.\r\nThe favours he received from the sovereign excited the jealousy of the\r\nvizier, and he was driven back to Africa (1364), where he was received\r\nwith great cordiality by the sultan of Bougie, Abu Abdallah, who had\r\nbeen formerly his companion in prison. On the fall of Abu Abdallah Ibn\r\nKhaldun raised a large force amongst the desert Arabs, and entered the\r\nservice of the sultan of Tlemçen. A few years later he was taken\r\nprisoner by Abdalaziz ('Abd ul 'Aziz), who had defeated the sultan of\r\nTlemçen and seized the throne. He then entered a monastic establishment,\r\nand occupied himself with scholastic duties, until in 1370 he was sent\r\nfor to Tlemçen by the new sultan. After the death of 'Abd ul 'Aziz he\r\nresided at Fez, enjoying the patronage and confidence of the regent.\r\nAfter some further vicissitudes in 1378 he entered the service of the\r\nsultan of his native town of Tunis, where he devoted himself almost\r\nexclusively to his studies and wrote his history of the Berbers. Having\r\nreceived permission to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, he reached Cairo,\r\nwhere he was presented to the sultan, al-Malik udh-Dhahir Barkuk, who\r\ninsisted on his remaining there, and in the year 1384 made him grand\r\ncadi of the Malikite rite for Cairo. This office he filled with great\r\nprudence and probity, removing many abuses in the administration of\r\njustice in Egypt. At this time the ship in which his wife and family,\r\nwith all his property, were coming to join him, was wrecked, and every\r\none on board lost. He endeavoured to find consolation in the completion\r\nof his history of the Arabs of Spain. At the same time he was removed\r\nfrom his office of cadi, which gave him more leisure for his work. Three\r\nyears later he made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and on his return lived in\r\nretirement in the Fayum until 1399, when he was again called upon to\r\nresume his functions as cadi. He was removed and reinstated in the\r\noffice no fewer than five times.\r\n\r\nIn 1400 he was sent to Damascus, in connexion with the expedition\r\nintended to oppose Timur or Tamerlane. When Timur had become master of\r\nthe situation, Ibn Khaldun let himself down from the walls of the city\r\nby a rope, and presented himself before the conqueror, who permitted him\r\nto return to Egypt. Ibn Khaldun died on the 16th of March 1406, at the\r\nage of sixty-four.\r\n\r\n  The great work by which he is known is a \"Universal History,\" but it\r\n  deals more particularly with the history of the Arabs of Spain and\r\n  Africa. Its Arabic title is _Kitab ul'Ibar, wa diwan el Mubtada wa'l\r\n  Khabar, fi ayyam ul 'Arab wa'l'Ajam wa'l Berber_; that is, \"The Book\r\n  of Examples and the Collection of Origins and Information respecting\r\n  the History of the Arabs, Foreigners and Berbers.\" It consists of\r\n  three books, an introduction and an autobiography. Book i. treats of\r\n  the influence of civilization upon man; book ii. of the history of the\r\n  Arabs and other peoples from the remotest antiquity until the author's\r\n  own times; book iii. of the history of the Berber tribes and of the\r\n  kingdoms founded by that race in North Africa. The introduction is an\r\n  elaborate treatise on the science of history and the development of\r\n  society, and the autobiography contains the history, not only of the\r\n  author himself, but of his family and of the dynasties which ruled in\r\n  Fez, Tunis and Tlemçen during his lifetime. An edition of the Arabic\r\n  text has been printed at Bulaq, (7 vols., 1867) and a part of the work\r\n  has been translated by the late Baron McG. de Slane under the title of\r\n  _Histoire des Berbères_ (Algiers, 1852-1856); it contains an admirable\r\n  account of the author and analysis of his work. Vol. i., the\r\n  _Muqaddama_ (preface), was published by M. Quatremère (3 vols., Paris,\r\n  1858), often republished in the East, and a French translation was\r\n  made by McG. de Slane (3 vols., Paris, 1862-1868). The parts of the\r\n  history referring to the expeditions of the Franks into Moslem lands\r\n  were edited by C. J. Tornberg (Upsala, 1840), and the parts treating\r\n  of the Banu-l Ahmar kings of Granada were translated into French by M.\r\n  Gaudefroy-Demombynes in the _Journal asiatique_, ser. 9, vol. xiii.\r\n  The _Autobiography_ of Ibn Khaldun was translated into French by de\r\n  Slane in the _Journal asiatique_, ser. 4, vol. iii. For an English\r\n  appreciation of the philosophical spirit of Ibn Khaldun see R. Flint's\r\n  _History of the Philosophy of History_ (Edinburgh, 1893), pp. 157-170.\r\n       (E. H. P.; G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN KHALLIKAN [Abu-l 'Abbas Ahmad ibn Khallikan] (1211-1282), Arabian\r\nbiographer, was born at Arbela, the son of a professor reputed to be\r\nascended from the Barmecides of the court of Harun al-Rashid. When\r\neighteen he went to Aleppo, where he studied for six years, then to\r\nDamascus, and in 1238 to Alexandria and Cairo. In 1252 he married and\r\nbecame chief cadi of Syria in Damascus in 1261. Having held this office\r\nfor ten years, he was professor in Cairo until 1278, when he again took\r\noffice in Damascus for three years. In 1281 he accepted a professorship\r\nin the same city, but died in the following year.\r\n\r\n  His great work is the _Kitab Wafayat ul-A'yan_, \"The Obituaries of\r\n  Eminent Men.\" It contains in alphabetical order the lives of the most\r\n  celebrated persons of Moslem history and literature, except those of\r\n  Mahomet, the four caliphs and the companions of Mahomet and their\r\n  followers (the _Tabiun_). The work is anecdotal and contains many\r\n  brief extracts from the poetry of the writers. It was published by F.\r\n  Wüstenfeld (Göttingen, 1835-1843), in part by McG. de Slane (Paris,\r\n  1838-1842), and also in Cairo (1859 and 1882). An English translation\r\n  by McG. de Slane was published for the Oriental Translation Fund in 4\r\n  vols. (London, 1842-1871). Thirteen extra biographies from a\r\n  manuscript in Amsterdam were published by Pijnappel (Amsterdam, 1845).\r\n  A Persian translation exists in manuscript, and various extracts from\r\n  the work are known. Several supplements to the book have been written,\r\n  the best known being that of Mahommed ibn Shakir (d. 1362), published\r\n  at Cairo 1882. A collection of poems by Ibn Khallikan is also extant.\r\n       (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN QUTAIBA, or KOTAIBA [Abu Mahommed ibn Muslim ibn Qutaiba] (828-889),\r\nArabian writer, was born at Bagdad or Kufa, and was of Iranian descent,\r\nhis father belonging to Merv. Having studied tradition and philology he\r\nbecame cadi in Dinawar and afterwards teacher in Bagdad, where he died.\r\nHe was the first representative of the eclectic school of Bagdad\r\nphilologists that succeeded the schools of Kufa and Basra (see ARABIA:\r\n_Literature_, section \"Grammar\"). Although engaged also in theological\r\npolemic (cf. I. Goldziher, _Muhammedanische Studien_, ii. 136, Halle,\r\n1890), his chief works were directed to the training of the ideal\r\nsecretary. Of these five may be said to form a series. The _Adab\r\nul-Katib_ (\"Training of the Secretary\") contains instruction in writing\r\nand is a compendium of Arabic style. It has been edited by Max Grünert\r\n(Leiden, 1900). The _Kitab ush-Sharab_ is still in manuscript. The\r\n_Kitab ul-Ma'arif_ has been edited by F. Wüstenfeld as the _Handbuch der\r\nGeschichte_[1] (Göttingen, 1850); the _Kitab ush-Shi'r wash-Shu'arai_\r\n(\"Book of Poetry and Poets\") edited by M. J. de Goeje (Leiden, 1904).[2]\r\nThe fifth and most important is the _'Uyun ul-Akhbar_, which deals in\r\nten books with lordship, war, nobility, character, science and\r\neloquence, asceticism, friendship, requests, foods and women, with many\r\nillustrations from history, poetry and proverb (ed. C. Brockelmann,\r\nLeiden, 1900 sqq.).\r\n\r\n  For other works (which were much quoted by later Arabian writers) see\r\n  C. Brockelmann, _Gesch. der arabischen Literatur_, vol. i.

He lived for the most part in Bagdad, and had\r\nthe reputation of being both trustworthy and accurate in his writings,\r\nwhich, in consequence, were much used by later writers. His work, the\r\n_Kitab ul-Tabaqat ul-Kabir_ (15 vols.) contains the lives of Mahomet,\r\nhis Companions and Helpers (including those who fought at Badr as a\r\nspecial class) and of the following generation (the Followers) who\r\nreceived their traditions from the personal friends of the Prophet.\r\n\r\n  This work has been edited under the superintendence of E.

T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN TIBBON, a family of Jewish translators, who flourished in Provence\r\nin the 12th and 13th centuries. They all made original contributions to\r\nphilosophical and scientific literature, but their permanent fame is\r\nbased on their translations. Between them they rendered into Hebrew all\r\nthe chief Jewish writings of the middle ages. These Hebrew translations\r\nwere, in their turn, rendered into Latin (by Buxtorf and others) and in\r\nthis form the works of Jewish authors found their way into the learned\r\ncircles of Europe. The chief members of the Ibn Tibbon family were (1)\r\nJUDAH BEN SAUL (1120-1190), who was born in Spain but settled in Lunel.\r\nHe translated the works of Bahya, Halevi, Saadiah and the grammatical\r\ntreatises of Janah. (2) His son, SAMUEL (1150-1230), translated the\r\n_Guide of the Perplexed_ by Maimonides. He justly termed his father \"the\r\nfather of the Translators,\" but Samuel's own method surpassed his\r\nfather's in lucidity and fidelity to the original. (3) Son of Samuel,\r\nMOSES (died 1283). He translated into Hebrew a large number of Arabic\r\nbooks (including the Arabic form of Euclid). The Ibn Tibbon family thus\r\nrendered conspicuous services to European culture, and did much to\r\nfurther among Jews who did not understand Arabic the study of science\r\nand philosophy.     (I. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBN TUFAIL, or TOFAIL [Abu Bakr Mahommed ibn 'Abd-ul-Malik ibn Tufail\r\nul-Qaisi] (d. 1185), Moslem philosopher, was born at Guadix near\r\nGranada. There he received a good training in philosophy and medicine,\r\nand is said to have been a pupil of Avempace (q.v.). He became secretary\r\nto the governor of Granada, and later physician and vizier to the Mohad\r\ncaliph, Abu Ya'qub Yusuf. He died at Morocco.\r\n\r\n  His chief work is a philosophical romance, in which he describes the\r\n  awakening and growth of intellect in a child removed from the\r\n  influences of ordinary life. Its Arabic title is _Risalat Hayy ibn\r\n  Yaqzan_; it was edited by E. Pococke as _Philosophus autodidactus_\r\n  (Oxford, 1671; 2nd ed., 1700), and with a French translation by L.\r\n  Gauthier (Algiers, 1900). An English translation by S. Ockley was\r\n  published in 1708 and has been reprinted since. A Spanish translation\r\n  by F. Pons Boigues was published at Saragossa (1900).

Singing, not study, attracted him, and at the age\r\nof twenty-three he fled to Mosul, where he joined a band of wild youths.\r\nAfter a year he went to Rai (Rei, Rhagae), where he met an ambassador of\r\nthe caliph Mansur, who enabled him to come to Basra and take singing\r\nlessons. His fame as a singer spread, and the caliph Mahdi brought him\r\nto the court. There he remained a favourite under Hadi, while Harun\r\nal-Rashid kept him always with him until his death, when he ordered his\r\nson (Ma'mun) to say the prayer over his corpse. Ibrahim, as might be\r\nexpected, was no strict Moslem. Two or three times he was knouted and\r\nimprisoned for excess in wine-drinking, but was always taken into favour\r\nagain. His powers of song were far beyond anything else known at the\r\ntime. Two of his pupils, his son Ishaq and Muhariq, attained celebrity\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n  See the Preface to W.

T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBRAHIM PASHA (1789-1848), Egyptian general, is sometimes spoken of as\r\nthe adopted son of Mehemet Ali, pasha of Egypt. He is also and more\r\ncommonly called his son. He was born in his father's native town, Kavala\r\nin Thrace. During his father's struggle to establish himself in Egypt,\r\nIbrahim, then sixteen years of age, was sent as a hostage to the Ottoman\r\ncapitan pasha (admiral), but when Mehemet Ali was recognized as pasha,\r\nand had defeated the English expedition under General A. M. Fraser, he\r\nwas allowed to return to Egypt. When Mehemet Ali went to Arabia to\r\nprosecute the war against the Wahhabis in 1813, Ibrahim was left in\r\ncommand in Upper Egypt. He continued the war with the broken power of\r\nthe Mamelukes, whom he suppressed. In 1816 he succeeded his brother\r\nTusun in command of the Egyptian forces in Arabia. Mehemet Ali had\r\nalready begun to introduce European discipline into his army, and\r\nIbrahim had probably received some training, but his first campaign was\r\nconducted more in the old Asiatic style than his later operations. The\r\ncampaign lasted two years, and terminated in the destruction of the\r\nWahhabis as a political power. Ibrahim landed at Yembo, the port of\r\nMedina, on the 30th of September 1816. The holy cities had been\r\nrecovered from the Wahhabis, and Ibrahim's task was to follow them into\r\nthe desert of Nejd and destroy their fortresses. Such training as the\r\nEgyptian troops had received, and their artillery, gave them a marked\r\nsuperiority in the open field. But the difficulty of crossing the desert\r\nto the Wahhabi stronghold of Deraiya, some 400 m. east of Medina, and\r\nthe courage of their opponents, made the conquest a very arduous one.\r\nIbrahim displayed great energy and tenacity, sharing all the hardships\r\nof his army, and never allowing himself to be discouraged by failure. By\r\nthe end of September 1818 he had forced the Wahhabi leader to surrender,\r\nand had taken Deraiya, which he ruined. On the 11th of December 1819 he\r\nmade a triumphal entry into Cairo. After his return he gave effective\r\nsupport to the Frenchman, Colonel Sève (Suleiman Pasha), who was\r\nemployed to drill the army on the European model. Ibrahim set an example\r\nby submitting to be drilled as a recruit. When in 1824 Mehemet Ali was\r\nappointed governor of the Morea by the sultan, who desired his help\r\nagainst the insurgent Greeks, he sent Ibrahim with a squadron and an\r\narmy of 17,000 men. The expedition sailed on the 10th of July 1824, but\r\nwas for some months unable to do more than come and go between Rhodes\r\nand Crete. The fear of the Greek fire ships stopped his way to the\r\nMorea. When the Greek sailors mutinied from want of pay, he was able to\r\nland at Modon on the 26th of February 1825. He remained in the Morea\r\ntill the capitulation of the 1st of October 1828 was forced on him by\r\nthe intervention of the Western powers. Ibrahim's operations in the\r\nMorea were energetic and ferocious. He easily defeated the Greeks in the\r\nopen field, and though the siege of Missolonghi proved costly to his own\r\ntroops and to the Turks who operated with him, he brought it to a\r\nsuccessful termination on the 24th of April 1826. The Greek guerrilla\r\nbands harassed his army, and in revenge he desolated the country and\r\nsent thousands of the inhabitants into slavery in Egypt. These measures\r\nof repression aroused great indignation in Europe, and led first to the\r\nintervention of the English, French and Russian squadrons (see NAVARINO,\r\nBATTLE OF), and then to the landing of a French expeditionary force. By\r\nthe terms of the capitulation of the 1st of October 1828, Ibrahim\r\nevacuated the country. It is fairly certain that the Turkish government,\r\njealous of his power, had laid a plot to prevent him and his troops from\r\nreturning to Egypt. English officers who saw him at Navarino describe\r\nhim as short, grossly fat and deeply marked with smallpox. His obesity\r\ndid not cause any abatement of activity when next he took the field. In\r\n1831, his father's quarrel with the Porte having become flagrant,\r\nIbrahim was sent to conquer Syria. He carried out his task with truly\r\nremarkable energy. He took Acre after a severe siege on the 27th of May\r\n1832, occupied Damascus, defeated a Turkish army at Homs on the 8th of\r\nJuly, defeated another Turkish army at Beilan on the 29th of July,\r\ninvaded Asia Minor, and finally routed the grand vizier at Konia on the\r\n21st of December. The convention of Kutaiah on the 6th of May left Syria\r\nfor a time in the hands of Mehemet Ali. Ibrahim was undoubtedly helped\r\nby Colonel Sève and the European officers in his army, but his\r\nintelligent docility to their advice, as well as his personal hardihood\r\nand energy, compare most favourably with the sloth, ignorance and\r\narrogant conceit of the Turkish generals opposed to him. He is entitled\r\nto full credit for the diplomatic judgment and tact he showed in\r\nsecuring the support of the inhabitants, whom he protected and whose\r\nrivalries he utilized. After the campaign of 1832 and 1833 Ibrahim\r\nremained as governor in Syria. He might perhaps have administered\r\nsuccessfully, but the exactions he was compelled to enforce by his\r\nfather soon ruined the popularity of his government and provoked\r\nrevolts. In 1838 the Porte felt strong enough to renew the struggle, and\r\nwar broke out once more. Ibrahim won his last victory for his father at\r\nNezib on the 24th of June 1839. But Great Britain and Austria intervened\r\nto preserve the integrity of Turkey. Their squadrons cut his\r\ncommunications by sea with Egypt, a general revolt isolated him in\r\nSyria, and he was finally compelled to evacuate the country in February\r\n1841. Ibrahim spent the rest of his life in peace, but his health was\r\nruined. In 1846 he paid a visit to western Europe, where he was received\r\nwith some respect and a great deal of curiosity. When his father became\r\nimbecile in 1848 he held the regency till his own death on the 10th of\r\nNovember 1848.\r\n\r\n  See Edouard Gouin, _L'Égypte au XIX^e siècle_ (Paris, 1847); Aimé\r\n  Vingtrinier, _Soliman-Pasha_ (_Colonel Sève_) (Paris, 1886).

Hist._ x. 852, bibliography to chap. xvii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBSEN, HENRIK (1828-1906), Norwegian dramatic and lyric poet, eldest son\r\nof Knud Henriksen Ibsen, a merchant, and of his wife Marichen Cornelia\r\nAltenburg, was born at Skien on the 20th of March 1828. For five\r\ngenerations the family had consisted on the father's side of a blending\r\nof the Danish, German and Scottish races, with no intermixture of pure\r\nNorwegian. In 1836 Knud Ibsen became insolvent, and the family withdrew,\r\nin great poverty, to a cottage in the outskirts of the town. After brief\r\nschooling at Skien, Ibsen was, towards the close of 1843, apprenticed to\r\nan apothecary in Grimstad; here he remained through seven dreary years\r\nof drudgery, which set their mark upon his spirit. In 1847, in his\r\nnineteenth year, he began to write poetry. He made a gloomy and almost\r\nsinister impression upon persons who met him at this time, and one of\r\nhis associates of those days has recorded that Ibsen \"walked about\r\nGrimstad like a mystery sealed with seven seals.\" He had continued, by\r\nassiduous reading, his self-education, and in 1850 he contrived to come\r\nup as a student to Christiania. In the same year he published his first\r\nwork, the blank-verse tragedy of _Catilina_, under the pseudonym\r\nBrynjolf Bjarme. A second drama, _The Viking's Barrow_, was acted (but\r\nnot printed) a few months later; Ibsen was at this time entirely under\r\nthe influence of the Danish poet Oehlenschläger. During the next year or\r\ntwo he made a very precarious livelihood in Christiania as a journalist,\r\nbut in November 1851 he had the good fortune to be appointed\r\n\"stage-poet\" at the little theatre of Bergen, with a small but regular\r\nsalary. He was practically manager at this house, and he also received a\r\ntravelling stipend. In 1852, therefore, he went for five months to study\r\nthe stage, to Copenhagen and to Dresden. Among many dramatic experiments\r\nwhich Ibsen made in Bergen, the most considerable and most satisfactory\r\nis the saga-drama of _Mistress Inger at Östraat_, which was produced in\r\n1855; and printed at Christiania in 1857; here are already perceptible\r\nsome qualities of his mature character. Much less significant, although\r\nat the time more successful, is _The Feast at Solhaug_, a tragedy\r\nproduced in Bergen in 1856; here for a moment Ibsen abandoned his own\r\nnascent manner for an imitation of the popular romantic dramatist of\r\nDenmark, Henrik Hertz. It is noticeable that Ibsen, by far the most\r\noriginal of modern writers for the stage, was remarkably slow in\r\ndiscovering the true bent of his genius. His next dramatic work was the\r\nromantic tragedy of _Olaf Liljekrans_, performed in 1857, but unprinted\r\nuntil 1898. This was the last play Ibsen wrote in Bergen. In the summer\r\nof the former year his five years' appointment came to an end, and he\r\nreturned to Christiania. Almost immediately he began the composition of\r\na work which showed an extraordinary advance on all that he had written\r\nbefore, the beautiful saga-drama of _The Warriors in Helgeland_, in\r\nwhich he threw off completely the influence of the Danish romantic\r\ntragedians, and took his material directly from the ancient Icelandic\r\nsources. This play marks an epoch in the development of Norwegian\r\nliterature. It was received by the managers, both in Christiania and\r\nCopenhagen, with contemptuous disapproval, and in the autumn of 1857\r\nIbsen could not contrive to produce it even at the new theatre of which\r\nhe was now the manager. _The Warriors_ was printed at Christiania in\r\n1858, but was not acted anywhere until 1861. During these years Ibsen\r\nsuffered many reverses and humiliations, but he persisted in his own\r\nline in art. Some of his finest short poems, among others the admirable\r\nseafaring romance, _Terje Vigen_, belong to the year 1860. The\r\nannoyances which Ibsen suffered, and the retrograde and ignorant\r\nconditions which he felt around him in Norway, developed the ironic\r\nqualities in his genius, and he became an acid satirist. The brilliant\r\nrhymed drama, _Love's Comedy_, a masterpiece of lyric wit and incisive\r\nvivacity, was published in 1862. This was a protest against the\r\nconventionality which deadens the beauty of all the formal relations\r\nbetween men and women, and against the pettiness, the publicity, and the\r\nprosiness of betrothed and married life among the middle classes in\r\nNorway; it showed how society murders the poetry of love. For some time\r\npast Ibsen had been meditating another saga-drama in prose, and in 1864\r\nthis appeared, _Kongsemnerne_ (The Pretenders). These works, however,\r\nnow so universally admired, contained an element of strangeness which\r\nwas not welcome when they were new. Ibsen's position in Christiania grew\r\nmore and more disagreeable, and he had positive misfortunes which added\r\nto his embarrassment. In 1862 his theatre became bankrupt, and he was\r\nglad to accept the poorly-paid post of \"aesthetic adviser\" at the other\r\nhouse. An attempt to obtain a poet's pension (_digtergage_) was\r\nunsuccessful; the Storthing, which had just voted one to Björnson,\r\nrefused to do the same for Ibsen. His cup was full of disillusion and\r\nbitterness, and in April 1864 he started, by Berlin and Trieste,\r\nultimately to settle in Rome. His anger and scorn gave point to the\r\nsatirical arrows which he shot back to his thankless fatherland from\r\nItaly in the splendid poem of _Brand_, published in Copenhagen in 1866,\r\na fierce attack on the Laodicean state of religious and moral sentiment\r\nin the Norway of that day; the central figure, the stern priest Brand,\r\nwho attempts to live like Christ and is snubbed and hounded away by his\r\nlatitudinarian companions, is one of the finest conceptions of a modern\r\npoet. Ibsen had scarcely closed _Brand_ before he started a third\r\nlyrico-dramatic satire. _Peer Gynt_ (1867), which remains, in a\r\ntechnical sense, the most highly finished of all his metrical works. In\r\n_Brand_ the hero had denounced certain weaknesses which Ibsen saw in the\r\nNorwegian character, but these and other faults are personified in the\r\nhero of _Peer Gynt_; or rather, in this figure the poet pictured, in a\r\ntype, the Norwegian nation in all the egotism, vacillation, and\r\nlukewarmness which he believed to be characteristic of it. Ibsen,\r\nhowever, acted better than he preached, and he soon forgot his\r\nabstraction in the portrait of Peer Gynt as a human individual. In this\r\nmagnificent work modern Norwegian literature first rises to a level with\r\nthe finest European poetry of the century. In 1869 Ibsen wrote the\r\nearliest of his prose dramas, the political comedy, _The Young Men's\r\nLeague_, in which for the first time he exercised his extraordinary gift\r\nfor perfectly natural and yet pregnant dialogue. Ibsen was in Egypt, in\r\nOctober 1869, when his comedy was put on the stage in Christiania, amid\r\nviolent expressions of hostility; on hearing the news, he wrote his\r\nbrilliant little poem of defiance, called _At Port Saïd_. By this time,\r\nhowever, he had become a successful author; _Brand_ sold largely, and\r\nhas continued to be the most popular of Ibsen's writings. In 1866,\r\nmoreover, the Storthing had been persuaded to vote him a \"poet's\r\npension,\" and there was now an end of Ibsen's long struggle with\r\npoverty. In 1868 he left Rome, and settled in Dresden until 1874, when\r\nhe returned to Norway. But after a short visit he went back to Germany,\r\nand lived first at Dresden, afterwards at Munich, and did not finally\r\nsettle in Christiania until 1891. His shorter lyrical poems were\r\ncollected in 1871, and in that year his name and certain of his writings\r\nwere for the first time mentioned to the English public. At this time he\r\nwas revising his old works, which were out of print, and which he would\r\nnot resign again to the reading world until he had subjected them to\r\nwhat in some instances (for example, _Mistress Inger at Östraat_)\r\namounted to practical recomposition. In 1873 he published a double\r\ndrama, each part of which was of unusual bulk, the whole forming the\r\ntragedy of _Emperor and Galilean_; this, Ibsen's latest historical play,\r\nhas for subject the unsuccessful struggle of Julian the Apostate to hold\r\nthe world against the rising tide of Christianity. The work is of an\r\nexperimental kind, and takes its place between the early poetry and the\r\nlater prose of the author. Compared with the series of plays which Ibsen\r\nhad already inaugurated with _The Young Men's League_, _Emperor and\r\nGalilean_ preserves a colour of idealism and even of mysticism which was\r\nfor many years to be absent from Ibsen's writings, but to reappear in\r\nhis old age with _The Master-builder_. There is some foundation for the\r\ncharge that Ibsen has made his romantic Greek emperor needlessly\r\nsqualid, and that he has robbed him, at last, too roughly of all that\r\nmade him a sympathetic exponent of Hellenism. Ibsen was now greatly\r\noccupied by the political spectacle of Germany at war first in Denmark,\r\nthen in France, and he believed that all things were conspiring to start\r\na new epoch of individualism. He was therefore deeply disgusted by the\r\nParis commune, and disappointed by the conservative reaction which\r\nsucceeded it. This disillusion in political matters had a very direct\r\ninfluence upon Ibsen's literary work. It persuaded him that nothing\r\ncould be expected in the way of reform from democracies, from large\r\nblind masses of men moved capriciously in any direction, but that the\r\nsole hope for the future must lie in the study of personality, in the\r\ndevelopment of individual character. He set himself to diagnose the\r\nconditions of society, which he had convinced himself lay sick unto\r\ndeath. Hitherto Ibsen had usually employed rhymed verse for his dramatic\r\ncompositions, or, in the case of his saga-plays, a studied and\r\nartificial prose. Now, in spite of the surprising achievements of his\r\npoetry, he determined to abandon versification, and to write only in the\r\nlanguage of everyday conversation. In the first drama of this his new\r\nperiod, _The Pillars of Society_ (1877), he dealt with the problem of\r\nhypocrisy in a small commercial centre of industry, and he drew in the\r\nBernick family a marvellous picture of social egotism in a prosperous\r\nseaport town. There was a certain similarity between this piece and _A\r\nDoll's House_ (1879), although the latter was much the more successful\r\nin awakening curiosity. Indeed, no production of Ibsen's has been so\r\nwidely discussed as this, which is nevertheless not the most coherently\r\nconceived of his plays. Here also, social hypocrisy, was the object of\r\nthe playwright's satire, but this time mainly in relation to marriage.\r\nIn _A Doll's House_ Ibsen first developed his views with regard to the\r\nindividualism of woman. In his previous writings he had depicted woman\r\nas a devoted and willing sacrifice to man; here he begins to explain\r\nthat she has no less a duty to herself, and must keep alive her own\r\nconception of honour and of responsibility. The conclusion of _A Doll's\r\nHouse_ was violently and continuously discussed through the length and\r\nbreadth of Europe, and to the situation of Nora Helmer is probably due\r\nmore than to anything else the long tradition that Ibsen is \"immoral.\"\r\nHe braved convention still more audaciously in _Ghosts_ (1881), perhaps\r\nthe most powerful of the series of plays in which Ibsen diagnoses the\r\ndiseases of modern society. It was received in Norway with a tumult of\r\nill-will, and the author was attacked no less venomously than he had\r\nbeen twenty years before. Ibsen was astonished and indignant at the\r\nreception given to _Ghosts_, and at the insolent indifferentism of the\r\nmajority to all ideas of social reform. He wrote, more as a pamphlet\r\nthan as a play, what is yet one of the most effective of his comedies,\r\n_An Enemy of the People_ (1882). Dr Stockmann, the hero of that piece,\r\ndiscovers that the drainage system of the bathing-station on which the\r\nlittle town depends is faulty, and the water impure and dangerous. He\r\nsupposes that the corporation will be grateful to have these\r\ndeficiencies pointed out; on the contrary, they hound him out of their\r\nmidst as an \"enemy of the people.\" In this play occurs Ibsen's famous\r\nand typical saying, \"a minority may be right--a majority is always\r\nwrong.\" This polemical comedy seemed at first to be somewhat weakened by\r\nthe personal indignation which runs through it, but it has held the\r\nstage. Ibsen's next drama, _The Wild Duck_ (1884), was written in\r\nsingular contrast with the zest and fire which had inspired _An Enemy of\r\nthe People_. Here he is squalid and pessimistic to a degree elsewhere\r\nunparalleled in his writings; it is not quite certain that he is not\r\nhere guilty of a touch of parody of himself. The main figure of the play\r\nis an unhealthy, unlucky enthusiast, who goes about making hopeless\r\nmischief by exposing weak places in the sordid subterfuges of others.\r\nThis drama contains a figure, Hjálmar Ekdal, who claims the bad\r\npre-eminence of being the meanest scoundrel in all drama. _The Wild\r\nDuck_ is the darkest, the least relieved, of Ibsen's studies of social\r\nlife, and his object in composing it is not obvious. With _Rosmersholm_\r\n(1886) he rose to the height of his genius again; this is a mournful,\r\nbut neither a pessimistic nor a cynical play. The fates which hang round\r\nthe contrasted lives of Rosmer and Rebecca, the weak-willed scrupulous\r\nman and the strong-willed unshrinking woman, the old culture and the\r\nnew, the sickly conscience and the robust one, create a splendid\r\ndramatic antithesis. Ibsen then began to compose a series of dramas, of\r\na more and more symbolical and poetic character; the earliest of these\r\nwas the mystical _The Lady from the Sea_ (1888). At Christmas 1890 he\r\nbrought out _Hedda Gabler_; two years later _The Master-builder_\r\n(_Bygmester Solnaes_), in which many critics see the highest attainment\r\nof his genius; at the close of 1894 _Little Eyolf_; in 1896 _John\r\nGabriel Borkman_; and in 1900 _When We Dead Awaken_. On the occasion of\r\nhis seventieth birthday (1898) Ibsen was the recipient of the highest\r\nhonours from his own country and of congratulations and gifts from all\r\nparts of the world. A colossal bronze statue of him was erected outside\r\nthe new National Theatre, Christiania, in September 1899. In 1901 his\r\nhealth began to decline, and he was ordered by the physician to abandon\r\nevery species of mental effort. The evil advanced, and he became\r\nunconscious of the passage of events. After lingering in this sad\r\ncondition he died, without suffering, on the 23rd of May 1906, and was\r\naccorded a public funeral, with the highest national honours.\r\n\r\nNo recent writer belonging to the smaller countries of Europe has had so\r\nwidely spread a fame as that of Ibsen, and although the value of his\r\ndramatic work is still contested, it has received the compliment of\r\nvivacious discussion in every part of the world. There would, perhaps,\r\nhave been less violence in this discussion if it had been perceived that\r\nthe author does not pose as a moral teacher, but as an imaginative\r\ninvestigator. He often and with much heat insisted that he was not\r\ncalled upon as a poet to suggest a remedy for the diseases of society,\r\nbut to diagnose them. In this he was diametrically opposed to Tolstoi,\r\nwho admitted that he wrote his books for the healing of the nations. If\r\nthe subjects which Ibsen treats, or some of them, are open to\r\ncontroversy, we are at least on firm ground in doing homage to the\r\nsplendour of his art as a playwright. He reintroduced into modern\r\ndramatic literature something of the velocity and inevitability of Greek\r\ntragic intrigue. It is very rarely that any technical fault can be found\r\nwith the architecture of his plots, and his dialogue is the most\r\nlifelike that the modern stage has seen. His long apprenticeship to the\r\ntheatre was of immense service to him in this respect. In every country,\r\nthough least perhaps in England, the influence of Ibsen has been marked\r\nin the theatrical productions of the younger school. Even in England, on\r\nthe rare occasions when his dramas are acted, they awaken great interest\r\namong intelligent playgoers.\r\n\r\n  The editions of Ibsen's works are numerous, but the final text is\r\n  included in the _Samlede Vaerker_, with a bibliography by J. B.\r\n  Halvorsen, published in Copenhagen, in 10 vols. (1898-1902). They have\r\n  been translated into the principal European languages, and into\r\n  Japanese. The study of Ibsen in English was begun by Mr Gosse in 1872,\r\n  and continued by Mr William Archer, whose version of Ibsen's prose\r\n  dramas appeared in 5 vols. (1890, 1891; new and revised edition,\r\n  1906). Other translators have been Mr C. Herford, Mr R. A.\r\n  Streatfield, Miss Frances Lord and Mr Adie. His _Correspondence_ was\r\n  edited, in 2 vols., under the supervision of his son, Sigurd Ibsen, in\r\n  1904 (Eng. trans., 1905). Critical studies on the writings and\r\n  position of Ibsen are innumerable, and only those which were\r\n  influential in guiding opinion, during the early part of his career,\r\n  in the various countries, can be mentioned here: Georg Brandes\r\n  _Ästhetiske Studier_ (Copenhagen, 1868); Les Quesnel, _Poésie\r\n  scandinave_ (Paris 1874); Valfrid Valsenius, _Henrik Ibsen_\r\n  (Helsingfors, 1879); Edmund Gosse, _Studies in Northern Literature_\r\n  (London, 1879); L. Passarge, _Henrik Ibsen_ (Leipzig, 1883); G.\r\n  Brandes, _Björnson och Ibsen_ (Stockholm, 1882); Henrik Jaeger,\r\n  _Henrik Ibsen 1828-1888_ (Copenhagen, 1888; Eng. trans., 1890); T.\r\n  Terwey, _Henrik Ibsen_ (Amsterdam, 1882); G. Bernard Shaw, _The\r\n  Quintessence of Ibsen_ (London, 1892). In France Count Moritz Prozor\r\n  carried on an ardent propaganda in favour of Ibsen from 1885, and\r\n  Jules Lemaître's articles in his _Les Contemporains_ and _Impressions\r\n  de théâtre_ did much to encourage discussion. W. Archer forwarded the\r\n  cause in England from 1878 onwards. In Germany Ibsen began to be known\r\n  in 1866, when John Grieg, P. F. Siebold and Adolf Strodtmann\r\n  successively drew attention to his early dramas; but his real\r\n  popularity among the Germans dates from 1880.     (E. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIBYCUS, of Rhegium in Italy, Greek lyric poet, contemporary of Anacreon,\r\nflourished in the 6th century B.C. Notwithstanding his good position at\r\nhome, he lived a wandering life, and spent a considerable time at the\r\ncourt of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos. The story of his death is thus\r\nrelated: While in the neighbourhood of Corinth, the poet was mortally\r\nwounded by robbers. As he lay dying he saw a flock of cranes flying\r\noverhead, and called upon them to avenge his death. The murderers betook\r\nthemselves to Corinth, and soon after, while sitting in the theatre, saw\r\nthe cranes hovering above. One of them, either in alarm or jest,\r\nejaculated, \"Behold the avengers of Ibycus,\" and thus gave the clue to\r\nthe detection of the crime (Plutarch, _De Garrulitate_, xiv.). The\r\nphrase, \"the cranes of Ibycus,\" passed into a proverb among the Greeks\r\nfor the discovery of crime through divine intervention. According to\r\nSuidas, Ibycus wrote seven books of lyrics, to some extent mythical and\r\nheroic, but mainly erotic (Cicero, _Tusc. Disp._ iv. 33), celebrating\r\nthe charms of beautiful youths and girls. F. G. Welcker suggests that\r\nthey were sung by choruses of boys at the \"beauty competitions\" held at\r\nLesbos. Although the metre and dialect are Dorian, the poems breathe the\r\nspirit of Aeolian melic poetry.\r\n\r\n  The best editions of the fragments are by F. W. Schneidewin (1833) and\r\n  Bergk, _Poëtae lyrici Graeci_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICA (YCA, or ECCA), a city of southern Peru and the capital of a\r\ndepartment of the same name, 170 m. S.S.E. of Lima, and 46 m. by rail\r\nS.E. of Pisco; its port on the Pacific coast. Pop. (1906, official\r\nestimate) 6000. It lies in a valley of the foothills of the Cordillera\r\nOccidental, which is watered by the Rio de Ica, is made highly fertile\r\nby irrigation, and is filled with vineyards and cotton fields; between\r\nthis valley and the coast is a desert. The original town was founded in\r\n1563, 4 m. E. of its present site, but it was destroyed by the\r\nearthquake of 1571, and again by that of 1664, after which the present\r\ntown was laid out near the ruins. In 1882 a Chilean marauding expedition\r\ninflicted great damage to private property in the town and vicinity.\r\nThese repeated disasters give the place a partially ruined appearance,\r\nbut it has considerable commercial and industrial prosperity. It has a\r\nlarge cotton factory and there are some smaller industries. Wine-making\r\nis one of the principal industries of the valley, and much brandy,\r\ncalled _pisco_, is exported from Pisco. A new industry is that of drying\r\nthe fruits for which this region is celebrated. Ica is the seat of a\r\nnational college.\r\n\r\nThe department of ICA lies between the Western Cordillera and the\r\nPacific coast, and extends from the department of Lima S.E. to that of\r\nArequipa. Pop. (1906, official estimate) 68,220; area 8721 sq. m. Ica is\r\nin the rainless region of Peru, and the greater part of its surface is\r\nbarren. It is crossed by the rivers Pisco, Ica and Grande, whose\r\ntributaries drain the western slope of the Cordillera, and whose valleys\r\nare fertile and highly cultivated. The valley of the Nasca, a tributary\r\nof the Grande, is celebrated for an extensive irrigating system\r\nconstructed by the natives before the discovery of America. The\r\nprincipal products of the department are cotton, grapes, wine, spirits,\r\nsugar and fruit. These are two good ports on the northern coast, Tambo\r\nde Mora and Pisco, the latter being connected with the capital by a\r\nrailway across the desert, 46 m. long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICE (a word common to Teutonic languages; cf. Ger. _Eis_), the solid\r\ncrystalline form which water assumes when exposed to a sufficiently low\r\ntemperature. It is a colourless crystalline substance, assuming forms\r\nbelonging to the hexagonal system, and distinguished by a well-marked\r\nhabit of twinning, which occasions the beautiful \"ice flowers\" displayed\r\nby hoar-frost. It is frequently precipitated as hoar-frost, snow or\r\nhail; and in the glaciers and snows of lofty mountain systems or of\r\nregions of high latitude it exists on a gigantic scale, being\r\nespecially characteristic of the seas and lands around the poles. In\r\nvarious regions, especially in France and Italy, great quantities of ice\r\nform in caves, which, in virtue of their depth below the earth's\r\nsurface, their height above the sea-level, or their exposure to suitable\r\nwinds, or to two or more of these conditions in combination, are\r\nunaffected by ordinary climatic changes, so that the mean annual\r\ntemperature is sufficiently low to ensure the permanency of the ice. The\r\ntemperature at which water freezes, and also at which ice melts, is so\r\nreadily determined that it is employed as one of the standard\r\ntemperatures in the graduation of ordinary thermometer scales, this\r\ntemperature being the zero of the Centigrade and Réaumur scales, and 32°\r\nof the Fahrenheit (see THERMOMETRY). In the act of freezing, water,\r\nthough its temperature remains unchanged, undergoes a remarkable\r\nexpansion so that ice at 0° C. is less dense than water--a fact\r\ndemonstrated by its power of floating. The sub-aqueous retention of\r\n\"ground-ice\" or \"anchor-ice,\" which forms in certain circumstances at\r\nthe bottom of streams or pools in which there are many eddies, is due to\r\nthe cohesion between it and the stones or rocks which compose the bed of\r\nthe streams or pools. As water expands on freezing, so conversely ice\r\ncontracts on melting; and the ice-cold water thus formed continues to\r\ncontract when heated until it has reached its point of maximum density,\r\nthe temperature at which this occurs being about 39° Fahr, or 4° C.\r\nAbove this point water continuously expands, and at no temperature is it\r\nless dense than ice as is shown by the following table:--\r\n\r\n  Density of ice at      0°C. =  .9175\r\n     \"       water at    0°C. =  .99988\r\n     \"          \"        4°C. = 1.00000\r\n     \"          \"       10°C. =  .99976\r\n     \"          \"      100°C. =  .95866\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of heat, ice itself behaves as most solids do,\r\ncontracting when cooled, expanding when heated. According to Plücker,\r\nthe coefficient of cubical dilatation at moderately low temperatures is\r\n0.0001585. From a series of elaborate experiments, Person deduced 0.505\r\nas the specific heat of ice, or about half that of water.\r\n\r\nThough no rise of temperature accompanies the melting of ice, there is\r\nyet a definite quantity of heat absorbed, namely, about 80 calories per\r\ngram; this is called the latent heat of fusion of water (see FUSION).\r\nThe same amount of heat is evolved when water becomes ice. That ice can\r\nbe melted by increase of pressure was first pointed out by James Thomson\r\nin 1849. He showed that, since water expands on freezing, the laws of\r\nthermodynamics require that its freezing-point must be lowered by\r\nincrease of pressure; and he calculated that for every additional\r\natmosphere of pressure the freezing-point of water was lowered by\r\n0.0075°. This result was verified by his brother, Sir William Thomson\r\n(Lord Kelvin), in 1850. The Thomsons and H. L. F. Helmholtz successfully\r\napplied this behaviour of ice under pressure to the explanation of many\r\nproperties of the substance. When two blocks of ice at 0° C. are pressed\r\ntogether or even simply laid in contact, they gradually unite along\r\ntheir touching surfaces till they form one block. This \"regelation\" is\r\ndue to the increased pressure at the various points of contact causing\r\nthe ice there to melt and cool. The water so formed tends to escape,\r\nthus relieving the pressure for an instant, refreezing and returning to\r\nthe original temperature. This succession of melting and freezing, with\r\ntheir accompanying thermal effects, goes on until the two blocks are\r\ncemented into one.\r\n\r\nIce forms over fresh water if the temperature of the air has been for a\r\nsufficient time at or below the freezing-point; but not until the whole\r\nmass of water has been cooled down to its point of maximum density, so\r\nthat the subsequent cooling of the surface can give rise to no\r\nconvection currents, is freezing possible. Sea-water, in the most\r\nfavourable circumstances, does not freeze till its temperature is\r\nreduced to about -2° C.; and the ice, when formed, is found to have\r\nrejected four-fifths of the salt which was originally present. In the\r\nupper provinces of India water is made to freeze during cold clear\r\nnights by leaving it overnight in porous vessels, or in bottles which\r\nare enwrapped in moistened cloth. The water then freezes in virtue of\r\nthe cold produced by its own evaporation or by the drying of the\r\nmoistened wrapper. In Bengal the natives resort to a still more\r\nelaborate forcing of the conditions. Pits are dug about 2 ft. deep and\r\nfilled three-quarters full with dry straw, on which are set flat porous\r\npans containing the water to be frozen. Exposed overnight to a cool dry\r\ngentle wind from the north-west, the water evaporates at the expense of\r\nits own heat, and the consequent cooling takes place with sufficient\r\nrapidity to overbalance the slow influx of heat from above through the\r\ncooled dense air or from below through the badly conducting straw.\r\n\r\n  See WATER, and for the manufacture of ice see REFRIGERATING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICEBERG (from ice and _Berg_, Ger. for hill, mountain), a floating mass\r\nof ice broken from the end of a glacier or from an ice-sheet. The word\r\nis sometimes, but rarely, applied to the arch of an Arctic glacier\r\nviewed from the sea. It is more commonly used to describe huge floating\r\nmasses of ice that drift from polar regions into navigable waters. They\r\nare occasionally encountered far beyond the polar regions, rising into\r\nbeautiful forms with breakers roaring into their caves and streams of\r\nwater pouring from their pinnacles in the warmer air. When, however,\r\nthey rest in comparatively warm water, melting takes place most rapidly\r\nat the base and they frequently overturn. Only one-ninth of the mass of\r\nice is seen above water. When a glacier descends to the sea, as in\r\nAlaska, and \"advances into water, the depth of which approaches its\r\nthickness, the ends are broken off and the detached masses float away as\r\nicebergs. Many of the bergs are overturned, or at least tilted, as they\r\nset sail. If this does not happen at once it is likely to occur later as\r\nthe result of the wave-cutting and melting which disturb their\r\nequilibrium\" (T. C. Chamberlin and R. D. Salisbury, _Geology: Processes\r\nand their Results_, 1905). These bergs carry a load of débris from the\r\nglacier and gradually strew their load upon the sea floor. They do not\r\ntravel far before losing all stony and earthy débris, but glacial\r\nmaterial found in dredgings shows that icebergs occasionally carry their\r\nload far from land. The structure of the iceberg varies with its origin\r\nand is always that of the glacier or ice-sheet from which it was broken.\r\nThe breaking off of the ice-sheet from a Greenland glacier is called\r\nlocally the \"calving\" of the glacier. The constantly renewed material\r\nfrom which the icebergs are formed is brought down by the motion of the\r\nglacier. The ice-sheet cracks at the end, and masses break off, owing to\r\nthe upward pressure of the water upon the lighter ice which is pushed\r\ninto it. This is accomplished with considerable violence. The\r\ndisintegration of an Arctic ice-sheet is a simpler matter, as the ice is\r\nalready floating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICELAND (Dan. _Island_), an island in the North Atlantic Ocean,\r\nbelonging to Denmark. Its extreme northerly point is touched by the\r\nArctic Circle; it lies between 13° 22´ and 24° 35´ W., and between 63°\r\n12´ and 66° 33´ N., and has an area of 40,437 sq. m. Its length is 298\r\nm. and its breadth 194 m., the shape being a rough oval, broken at the\r\nnorth-west, where a peninsula, diversified by a great number of fjords,\r\nprojects from the main portion of the island. The total length of the\r\ncoast-line is about 3730 m., of which approximately one-third belongs to\r\nthe north-western peninsula. Iceland is a plateau or tableland, built up\r\nof volcanic rocks of older and younger formation, and pierced on all\r\nsides by fjords and valleys. Compared with the tableland, the lowlands\r\nhave a relatively small area, namely, one-fourteenth of the whole; but\r\nthese lowlands are almost the only parts of the island which are\r\ninhabited. In consequence of the rigour of its climate, the central\r\ntableland is absolutely uninhabitable. At the outside, not more than\r\none-fourth of the area of Iceland is inhabited; the rest consists of\r\nelevated deserts, lava streams and glaciers. The north-west peninsula is\r\nseparated from the main mass of the island by the bays Hunaflói and\r\nBreiðifjörðr, so that there are really two tablelands, a larger and a\r\nsmaller. The isthmus which connects the two is only 4¼ m. across, but\r\nhas an altitude of 748 ft. The mean elevation of the north-west\r\npeninsula is 2000 ft. The fjords and glens which cut into it are shut in\r\nby precipitous walls of basalt, which plainly shows that they have been\r\nformed by erosion through the mass of the plateau. The surface of this\r\ntableland is also bare and desolate, being covered with gravel and\r\nfragments of rock. Here and there are large straggling snowfields, the\r\nlargest being Glámu and Drangajökull,[1] on the culminating points of\r\nthe plateau. The only inhabited districts are the shores of the fjords,\r\nwhere grass grows capable of supporting sheep; but a large proportion of\r\nthe population gain their livelihood by fishing. The other and larger\r\ntableland, which constitutes the substantial part of Iceland, reaches\r\nits culminating point in the south-east, in the gigantic snowfield of\r\nVatnajökull, which covers 3300 sq. m. The axis of highest elevation of\r\nIceland stretches from north-west to south-east, from the head of\r\nHvammsfjörðr to Hornafjörðr, and from this water-parting the rivers\r\ndescend on both sides. The crest of the water-parting is crowned by a\r\nchain of snow-capped mountains, separated by broad patches of lower\r\nground. They are really a chain of minor plateaus which rise 4500 to\r\n6250 ft. above sea-level and 2000 to 3000 ft. above the tableland\r\nitself. In the extreme east is Vatnajökull, which is separated from\r\nTungnafellsjökull by Vonarskard (3300 ft.). Between Tungnafellsjökull\r\nand Hofsjökull lies the broad depression of Sprengisandr (2130 ft.).\r\nContinuing north-west, between Hofsjökull and the next snow-capped\r\nmountain, Langjökull, lies Kjölur (2000 ft.); and between Langjökull and\r\nEiriksjökull, Flosaskard (2630 ft.). To the north of the _jöklar_ last\r\nmentioned there are a number of lakes, all well stocked with fish.\r\nNumerous valleys or glens penetrate into the tableland, especially on\r\nthe north and east, and between them long mountain spurs, sections of\r\nthe tableland which have resisted the action of erosion, thrust\r\nthemselves towards the sea. Of these the most considerable is the mass\r\ncrowned by Mýrdalsjökull, which stretches towards the south. The\r\ninterior of the tableland consists for the most part of barren,\r\ngrassless deserts, the surface being covered by gravel, loose fragments\r\nof rock, lava, driftsand, volcanic ashes and glacial detritus.\r\n\r\nSave the lower parts of the larger glens, there are no lowlands on the\r\nnorth and east. The south coast is flat next the sea; but immediately\r\nunderneath Vatnajökull there is a strip of gravel and sand, brought down\r\nand deposited by the glacial streams. The largest low-lying plain of\r\nIceland, lying between Mýrdalsjökull and Reykjanes, has an area of about\r\n1550 sq. m. In its lowest parts this plain barely keeps above sea-level,\r\nbut it rises gradually towards the interior, terminating in a\r\nramification of valleys. Its maximum altitude is attained at 381 ft.\r\nnear Geysir. On the west of Mount Hekla this plain connects by a regular\r\nslope directly with the tableland, to the great injury of its inhabited\r\ndistricts, which are thus exposed to the clouds of pumice dust and\r\ndriftsand that cover large areas of the interior. Nevertheless the\r\ngreater part of this lowland plain produces good grass, and is\r\nrelatively well inhabited. The plain is drained by three\r\nrivers--Markarfljót, Thjórsá and Oelfusá--all of large volume, and\r\nnumerous smaller streams. Towards the west there exist a number of warm\r\nsprings. There is another lowland plain around the head of Faxaflói,\r\nnearly 400 sq. m. in extent. As a rule the surface of this second plain\r\nis very marshy. Several dales or glens penetrate the central tableland;\r\nthe eastern part of this lowland is called Borgarfjörðr, the western\r\npart Mýrar.\r\n\r\nThe great bays on the west of the island (Faxaflói and Breiðifjörðr),[2]\r\nas well as the many bays on the north, which are separated from one\r\nanother by rocky promontories, appear to owe their origin to subsidences\r\nof the surface; whereas the fjords of the north-west peninsula, which\r\nmake excellent harbours, and those of the east coast seem to be the\r\nresult chiefly of erosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Iceland.]\r\n\r\n_Glaciers_.--An area of 5170 sq. m. is covered with snowfields and\r\nglaciers. This extraordinary development of ice and snow is due to the\r\nraw, moist climate, the large rainfall and the low summer temperature.\r\nThe snow-line varies greatly in different parts of the island, its range\r\nbeing from 1300 to 4250 ft. It is highest on the tableland, on the north\r\nside of Vatnajökull, and lowest on the north-west peninsula, to the\r\nsouth of North Cape. Without exception the great _névés_ of Iceland\r\nbelong to the interior tableland. They consist of slightly rounded domes\r\nor billowy snowfields of vast thickness. In external appearance they\r\nbear a closer resemblance to the glaciers of the Polar regions than to\r\nthose of the Alps. The largest snowfields are Vatnajökull (3280 sq. m.),\r\nHofsjökull (520) Langjökull (500) and Mýrdalsjökull (390). The glaciers\r\nwhich stream off from these snowfields are often of vast extent, e.g.\r\nthe largest glacier of Vatnajökull has an area of 150 to 200 sq. m., but\r\nthe greater number are small. Altogether, more than 120 glaciers are\r\nknown in Iceland. It is on the south side of Vatnajökull that they\r\ndescend lowest; the lower end of Breidamerkurjökull was in the year 1894\r\nonly 30 ft. above sea-level. The glaciers of the north-west peninsula\r\nalso descend nearly to sea-level. The great number of streams of large\r\nvolume is due to the moist climate and the abundance of glaciers, and\r\nthe milky white or yellowish-brown colour of their waters (whence the\r\ncommon name Hvítá, white) is due to the glacial clays. The majority of\r\nthem change their courses very often, and vary greatly in volume;\r\nfrequently they are impetuous torrents, forming numerous waterfalls.\r\nIceland also possesses a great number of lakes, the largest being\r\nThingvallavatn[3] and Thorisvatn, each about 27 sq. m. in area. Mývatn,\r\nin the north, is well known from the natural beauty of its surroundings.\r\nAbove its surface tower a great number of volcanoes and several craters,\r\nand its waters are alive with water-fowl, a multitude of ducks of\r\nvarious species breeding on its islands. The lakes of Iceland owe their\r\norigin to different causes, some being due to glacial erosion, others to\r\nvolcanic subsidence. Mývatn fills a depression between lava streams, and\r\nhas a depth of not more than 8¾ ft. The group of lakes called Fiskivötn\r\n(or Veidivötn), which lie in a desolate region to the west of\r\nVatnajökull, consist for the most part of crater lakes. The groups of\r\nlakes which lie north-west from Langjökull occupy basins formed between\r\nridges of glacial gravel; and in the valleys numerous lakes are found\r\nat the backs of the old moraines.\r\n\r\n_Volcanoes_.--Iceland is one of the most volcanic regions of the earth;\r\nvolcanic activity has gone on continuously from the formation of the\r\nisland in the Tertiary period down to the present time. So far as is\r\nknown, there have in historic times been eruptions from twenty-five\r\nvolcanic vents. Altogether 107 volcanoes are known to exist in Iceland,\r\nwith thousands of craters, great and small. The lava-streams which have\r\nflowed from them since the Glacial epoch now cover an area of 4650 sq.\r\nm. They are grouped in dense masses round the volcanoes from which they\r\nhave flowed, the bulk of the lava dating from outbreaks which occurred\r\nin prehistoric times. The largest volume of lava which has issued at one\r\noutflow within historic times is the stream which came from the craters\r\nof Laki at Skaptá. This belongs to the year 1783, and covers an area of\r\n218 sq. m., and amounts to a volume represented by a cube each of whose\r\nsides measures 7½ m. The largest unbroken lava-field in Iceland is\r\nOdaðahraun (Lava of Evil Deeds), upon the tableland north from\r\nVatnajökull (2000 to 4000 ft. above sea-level). It is the accretion of\r\ncountless eruptions from over twenty volcanoes, and covers an area of\r\n1300 sq.m. (or, including all its ramifications and minor detached\r\nstreams, 1700 sq. m.), and its volume would fill a cube measuring 13.4\r\nm. in every direction. As regards their superficies, the lava-streams\r\ndiffer greatly. Sometimes they are very uneven and jagged (_apalhraun_),\r\nconsisting of blocks of lava loosely flung together in the utmost\r\nconfusion. The great lava-fields, however, are composed of vast sheets\r\nof lava, ruptured and riven in divers ways (_helluhraun_). The smooth\r\nsurface of the viscous billowy lava is further diversified by long\r\ntwisted \"ropes,\" curving backwards and forwards up and down the\r\nundulations. Moreover, there are gigantic fissures, running for several\r\nmiles, caused by subsidences of the underlying sections. The best-known\r\nfissure of this character is Almannagjá at Thingvellir. On the occasion\r\nof outbreaks the fine ashes are scattered over a large portion of the\r\nisland, and sometimes carried far across the Atlantic. After the\r\neruption of Katla in 1625 the ashes were blown as far as Bergen in\r\nNorway, and when Askja was in eruption in 1875 a rain of ashes fell on\r\nthe west coast of Norway 11 hours 40 minutes, and at Stockholm 15 hours,\r\nafterwards. The volcanic ash frequently proves extremely harmful,\r\ndestroying the pastures so that the sheep and cattle die of hunger and\r\ndisease. The outbreak of Laki in 1783 occasioned the loss of 11,500\r\ncattle, 28,000 horses and 190,500 sheep--that is to say, 53% of the\r\ncattle in the island, 77% of the horses and 82% of the sheep. After that\r\nthe island was visited by a famine, which destroyed 9500 people, or\r\none-fifth of the total population.\r\n\r\nThe Icelandic volcanoes may be divided into three classes: (1)\r\ncone-shaped, like Vesuvius, built up of alternate layers of ashes,\r\nscoriae and lava; (2) cupola-shaped, with an easy slope and a vast\r\ncrater opening at the top--these shield-shaped cupolas are composed\r\nentirely of layers of lava, and their inclination is seldom steeper than\r\n7°-8°; (3) chains of craters running close alongside a fissure in the\r\nground. For the most part the individual craters are low, generally not\r\nexceeding 300 to 500 ft. These crater chains are both very common and\r\noften very long. The chain of Laki, which was formed in 1783, extends 20\r\nm., and embraces about one hundred separate craters. Sometimes, however,\r\nthe lava-streams are vomited straight out of gigantic fissures in the\r\nearth without any crater being formed. Many of the Icelandic volcanoes\r\nduring their periods of quiescence are covered with snow and ice. Then\r\nwhen an outbreak occurs the snow and ice melt, and in that way they\r\nsometimes give rise to serious catastrophes (_jökulhlaup_), through\r\nlarge areas being suddenly inundated by great floods of water, which\r\nbear masses of ice floating on their surface. Katla caused very serious\r\ndestruction in this way by converting several cultivated districts into\r\nbarren wastes. In the same way in the year 1362 Oeræfajökull, the\r\nloftiest mountain in Iceland (6424 ft.), swept forty farms, together\r\nwith their inhabitants and live stock, bodily into the ocean. The\r\nbest-known volcano is Hekla (5108 ft.), which was in eruption eighteen\r\ntimes within the historic period down to 1845. Katla during the same\r\nperiod was active thirteen times down to 1860. The largest volcano is\r\nAskja, situated in the middle of the lava-field of Odaðahraun. Its\r\ncrater measures 34 sq. m. in area. At Mývatn there are several\r\nvolcanoes, which were particularly active in the years 1724-1730. On\r\nseveral occasions there have been volcanic outbreaks under the sea\r\noutside the peninsula of Reykjanes, islands appearing and afterwards\r\ndisappearing again. The crater chain of Laki has only been in eruption\r\nonce in historic times, namely, the violent and disastrous outbreak of\r\n1783. Iceland, however, possesses no constantly active volcano. There\r\nare often long intervals between the successive outbreaks, and many of\r\nthe volcanoes (and this is especially true of the chains of craters)\r\nhave only vented themselves in a solitary outburst.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are frequent, especially in the districts which are\r\npeculiarly volcanic. Historical evidence goes to show that they are\r\nclosely associated with three naturally defined regions: (1) the region\r\nbetween Skjálfandi and Axarfjörðr in the north, where violent earth\r\ntremblings are extremely common; (2) at Faxaflói, where minor vibrations\r\nare frequent; (3) the southern lowlands, between Reykjanes and\r\nMýrdalsjökull, have frequently been devastated by violent earthquake\r\nshocks, with great loss of property and life, e.g. on the 14th-16th of\r\nAugust 1784, when 92 farmsteads were totally destroyed, and 372\r\nfarmsteads and 11 churches were seriously damaged; and again in August\r\nand September 1896, when another terrible earthquake destroyed 161\r\nfarmsteads and damaged 155 others. Hot springs are found in every part\r\nof Iceland, both singly and in groups; they are particularly numerous in\r\nthe western portion of the southern lowlands, where amongst others is\r\nthe famous Geyser (q.v.). Sulphur springs and boiling mud lakes are also\r\ngeneral in the volcanic districts; and in places there are carbonic acid\r\nsprings, these more especially on the peninsula of Snæfellsnes, north of\r\nFaxaflói.\r\n\r\n  _Geology_.--Iceland is built up almost entirely of volcanic rocks,\r\n  none of them older, however, than the middle of the Tertiary period.\r\n  The earlier flows were probably contemporaneous with those of\r\n  Greenland, the Færoes, the western islands of Scotland and the\r\n  north-east of Ireland. The principal varieties are basalt and\r\n  palagonitic breccias, the former covering two-thirds of the entire\r\n  area, the latter the remaining one-third. Compared with these two\r\n  systems, all other formations have an insignificant development. The\r\n  palagonitic breccias, which stretch in an irregular belt across the\r\n  island, are younger than the basalt. In the north-west, north and east\r\n  the coasts are formed of basalt, and rise in steep, gloomy walls of\r\n  rock to altitudes of 3000 ft. and more above sea-level. Deposits of\r\n  clay, with remains of plants of the Tertiary period, lignite and\r\n  tree-trunks pressed flat, which the Icelanders call _surtarbrandur_,\r\n  occur in places in the heart of the basalt formation. These\r\n  fossiliferous strata are developed in greatest thickness in the\r\n  north-west peninsula. Indeed, in some few places well-marked\r\n  impressions of leaves and fruit have been discovered, proving that in\r\n  Tertiary times Iceland possessed extensive forests, and its annual\r\n  mean temperature must have been at least 48° Fahr., whereas the\r\n  present mean is 35.6°. The palagonitic breccias, which attain their\r\n  greatest development in the south of the island and on the tableland,\r\n  consist of reddish, brown or yellowish rocks, tuffs and breccias,\r\n  belonging to several different groups or divisions, the youngest of\r\n  which seems to be of a date subsequent to the Glacial epoch. All over\r\n  Iceland, in both the basalt and breccia formations, there occur small\r\n  intrusive beds and dikes of liparite, and as this rock is of a lighter\r\n  colour than the basalt, it is visible from a distance. In the\r\n  south-east of the island, in the parish of Lón, there exist a few\r\n  mountains of gabbro, a rock which does not occur in any other part of\r\n  Iceland. Near Húsavik in the north there have been found marine\r\n  deposits containing a number of marine shells; they belong to the Red\r\n  Crag division of the Pliocene. In the middle of Iceland, where the\r\n  geological foundation is tuff and breccias, large areas are buried\r\n  under ancient outflows of lava, which bear evidences of glacial\r\n  scratching. These lava streams, which are of a doleritic character,\r\n  flowed before the Glacial age, or during its continuance, out of lava\r\n  cones with gigantic crater openings, such as may be seen at the\r\n  present day. During the Glacial epoch the whole of Iceland was covered\r\n  by a vast sheet of inland ice, except for a few small isolated peaks\r\n  rising along its outer margins. This ice-cap had on the tableland a\r\n  thickness of 2300 to 2600 ft. Rocks scored by glacial ice and showing\r\n  plain indications of striation, together with thousands of erratic\r\n  blocks, are found scattered all over Iceland. Signs of elevation\r\n  subsequent to the Glacial epoch are common all round the island,\r\n  especially on the north-west peninsula. There are found strikingly\r\n  developed marine terraces of gravel, shore lines and surf beaches\r\n  marked on the solid rock. In several places there are traces of\r\n  shells; and sometimes skeletal remains of whales and walruses, as well\r\n  as ancient driftwood, have been discovered at tolerable distances from\r\n  the present coast. The ancient shore-lines occur at two different\r\n  altitudes. Along the higher, 230 to 266 ft. above the existing\r\n  sea-level, shells have been found which are characteristic of high\r\n  Arctic latitudes and no longer exist in Iceland; whereas on the lower\r\n  shore-line, 100 to 130 ft., the shells belong to species which occur\r\n  amongst the coast fauna of the present day.\r\n\r\n  The geysers and other hot springs are due to the same causes as the\r\n  active volcanoes, and the earthquakes are probably manifestations of\r\n  the same forces. A feature of special interest to geologists in the\r\n  present conditions of the island is the great power of the wind both\r\n  as a transporting and denuding agent. The rock sculpture is often very\r\n  similar to that of a tropical desert.[4]\r\n\r\n_Climate_.--Considering its high latitude and situation, Iceland has a\r\nrelatively mild climate. The meteorological conditions vary greatly,\r\nhowever, in different parts of the island. In the south and east the\r\nweather is generally changeable, stormy and moist; whilst on the north\r\nthe rainfall is less. The climate of the interior tableland approximates\r\nto the continental type and is often extremely cold. The mean annual\r\ntemperature is 37.2° F. in Stykkishólmr on Breiðifjörðr, 38.5° at\r\nEyrarbakki in the south of Iceland, 41° at Vestmannæyjar, 36° at\r\nAkureyri in the north, 36.7° on Berufjörðr in the east, and 30.6° at\r\nMödrudalr on the central tableland. The range is great not only from\r\nyear to year, but also from month to month. For instance, at\r\nStykkishólmr the highest annual mean for March was 39.7°, and the lowest\r\n8°, during a period of thirty-eight years. Iceland lies contiguous to\r\nthat part of the north Atlantic in which the shifting areas of low\r\npressure prevail, so that storms are frequent and the barometer is\r\nseldom firm. The barometric pressure at sea-level in the south-west of\r\nIceland during the period 1878-1900 varied between 30.8 and 27.1 in. The\r\nclimate of the coasts is relatively mild in summer, but tolerably cold\r\nin winter. The winter means of the north and east coasts average 31.7°\r\nand 31.3° F. respectively; the summer means, 42.8° and 44.6°; and the\r\nmeans of the year, 33.1° and 35.6°. The winter means of the south and\r\nwest coasts average 32° and 31.7° respectively; the summer means, 48.2°\r\nand 50°; the annual means, 37.4° and 39.2°. The rainfall on the south\r\nand east coasts is considerable, e.g. at Vestmannæyjar, 49.4 in. in the\r\nyear; at Berufjörðr, 43.6 in. On the west coast it is less, e.g. 24.3\r\nin. at Stykkishólmr; but least of all on the north coast, being only\r\n14.6 in. on the island of Grimsey, which lies off that coast. Mist is\r\ncommonly prevalent on the east coast; at Berufjörðr there is mist on no\r\nfewer than 212 days in the year. The south and west coasts are washed by\r\nthe Gulf Stream, and the north coast by an Arctic current, which\r\nfrequently brings with it a quantity of drift-ice, and thus exercises a\r\nconsiderable effect upon the climate of the island; sometimes it blocks\r\nthe north coast in the summer months. On the whole, during the 19th\r\ncentury, the north coast was free from ice on an average of one year in\r\nevery four or five. The clearness of the atmosphere has been frequently\r\nremarked. Thunderstorms occur mostly in winter.\r\n\r\n  _Flora_.--The vegetation presents the characteristics of an Arctic\r\n  European type, and is tolerably uniform throughout the island, the\r\n  differences even on the tableland being slight. At present 435 species\r\n  of phanerogams and vascular cryptogams are known; the lower orders\r\n  have been little investigated. The grasses are of the greatest\r\n  importance to the inhabitants, for upon them they are dependent for\r\n  the keep of their live stock. Heather covers large tracts, and also\r\n  affords pasture for sheep. The development of forest trees is\r\n  insignificant. Birch woods exist in a good many places, especially in\r\n  the warmer valleys; but the trees are very short, scarcely attaining\r\n  more than 3 to 10 ft. in height. In a few places, however, they reach\r\n  13 to 20 ft. and occasionally more. A few mountain ash or rowan trees\r\n  (_Sorbus aucuparia_) are found singly here and there, and attain to 30\r\n  ft. in height. Willows are also pretty general, the highest in growth\r\n  being _Salix phyllicifolia_, 7 to 10 ft. The wild flora of Iceland is\r\n  small and delicate, with bright bloom, the heaths being especially\r\n  admired. Wild crowberries and bilberries are the only fruit found in\r\n  the island.\r\n\r\n  _Fauna_.--The Icelandic fauna is of a sub-Arctic type. But while the\r\n  species are few, the individuals are often numerous. The land mammals\r\n  are very poorly represented; and it is doubtful whether any species is\r\n  indigenous. The polar bear is an occasional visitant, being brought to\r\n  the coast by the Greenland drift-ice. Foxes are common, both the white\r\n  and the blue occurring; mice and the brown rat have been introduced,\r\n  though one variety of mouse is possibly indigenous. Reindeer were\r\n  introduced in 1770. The marine mammalia are numerous. The walrus is\r\n  now seldom seen, although in prehistoric times it was common. There\r\n  are numerous species of seals; and the seas abound in whales. Of birds\r\n  there are over 100 species, more than one-half being aquatic. In the\r\n  interior the whistling swan is common, and numerous varieties of ducks\r\n  are found in the lakes. The eider duck, which breeds on the islands of\r\n  Breiðifjörðr, is a source of livelihood to the inhabitants, as are\r\n  also the many kinds of sea-fowl which breed on the sea-cliffs. Iceland\r\n  possesses neither reptiles nor batrachians. The fish fauna is abundant\r\n  in individuals, some sixty-eight species being found off the coasts.\r\n  The cod fisheries are amongst the most important in the world. Large\r\n  quantities of herring, plaice and halibut are also taken. Many of the\r\n  rivers abound in salmon, and trout are plentiful in the lakes and\r\n  streams.\r\n\r\n_Population and Towns_.--The census of 1890 gave a total population of\r\n70,927, and this number had increased by 1901 to 78,489. The increase\r\nduring the 19th century was 27,000, while at least 15,600 Icelanders\r\nemigrated to America, chiefly to Manitoba, from 1872 to the close of the\r\ncentury. The largest town is Reykjavik on Faxaflói, with 6700\r\ninhabitants, the capital of the island, and the place of residence of\r\nthe governor-general and the bishop. Here the Althing meets; and here,\r\nfurther, are the principal public institutions of the island (library,\r\nschools, &c.). The town possesses a statue to Thorvaldsen, the famous\r\nsculptor, who was of Icelandic descent. The remaining towns include\r\nIsafjörðr (pop. 1000) on the north-west peninsula, Akureyri (1000) on\r\nthe north and Seydisfjörðr (800) in the east.\r\n\r\n_Industries_.--The principal occupation of the Icelanders is\r\ncattle-breeding, and more particularly sheep-breeding, although the\r\nfishing industries have come rapidly to the front in modern times. In\r\n1850, 82% of the population were dependent upon cattle-breeding and 7%\r\nupon fishing; in 1890 the numbers were 64% and 18% respectively. The\r\nculture of grain is not practised in Iceland; all bread-stuffs are\r\nimported. In ancient times barley was grown in some places, but it never\r\npaid for the cost of cultivation. Cattle-breeding has declined in\r\nimportance, while the number of sheep has increased. Formerly gardening\r\nwas of no importance, but considerable progress has been made in this\r\nbranch in modern times, as also in the cultivation of potatoes and\r\nturnips. Fruit-trees will not thrive; but black and red currants and\r\nrhubarb are grown, the last-named doing excellently. Iceland possesses\r\nfour agricultural schools, one agricultural society, and small\r\nagricultural associations in nearly every district. The fisheries give\r\nemployment to about 12,000 people. For the most part the fishing is\r\ncarried on from open boats, notwithstanding the dangers of so stormy a\r\ncoast. But larger decked vessels have come into increasing use. In\r\nsummer the waters are visited by a great number of foreign fishermen,\r\ninclusive of about 300 fishing-boats from French ports, as well as by\r\nfishing-boats from the Færoes and Norway, and steam trawlers from\r\nEngland. Excellent profit is made in certain parts of the island from\r\nthe herring fishery; this is especially the case on the east coast.\r\nThere are marine insurance societies and a school of navigation at\r\nReykjavik. The export of fish and fish products has greatly increased.\r\nIn 1849 to 1855 the annual average exported was 1480 tons; whereas at\r\nthe close of the century (in 1899) it amounted to 11,339 tons and 68,079\r\nbarrels of oil, valued at £276,596.\r\n\r\n_Commerce_.--From the first colonization of the island down to the 14th\r\ncentury the trade was in the hands of native Icelanders and Norsemen; in\r\nthe 15th century it was chiefly in the hands of the English, in the 16th\r\nof Germans from the Hanse towns. From 1602 to 1786 commerce was a\r\nmonopoly of the Danish government; in the latter year it was declared\r\nfree to all Danish subjects and in 1854 free to all nations. Since 1874,\r\nwhen Iceland obtained her own administration, commerce has increased\r\nconsiderably. Thus the total value of the imports and exports together\r\nin 1849 did not exceed £170,000; while in 1891-1895 the imports averaged\r\n£356,000 and the exports £340,000. In 1902 imports were valued at\r\n£596,193 and exports at £511,083. Trade is almost entirely with Denmark,\r\nthe United Kingdom, and Norway and Sweden, in this order according to\r\nvalue. The principal native products exported are live sheep, horses,\r\nsalt meat, wool and hides, to which must be added the fish\r\nproducts--cod, train-oil, herring and salmon--eiderdown and woollen\r\nwares. The spinning, weaving and knitting of wool is a widespread\r\nindustry, and the native tweed (_vaðmal_) is the principal material for\r\nthe clothing of the inhabitants. The imports consist principally of\r\ncereals and flour, coffee, sugar, ale, wines and spirits, tobacco,\r\nmanufactured wares, iron and metal wares, timber, salt, coal, &c. The\r\nmoney, weights and measures in use are the same as in Denmark. The\r\nIslands Bank in Reykjavik (1904) is authorized to issue bank-notes up to\r\n£133,900 in total value.\r\n\r\n_Communications_.--All land journeys are made on horseback, and in the\r\nremoter parts all goods have to be transported by the same means.\r\nThroughout the greater part of the island there exist no proper roads\r\neven in the inhabited districts, but only bridle-paths, and in the\r\nuninhabited districts not even these. Nevertheless much has been done to\r\nimprove such paths as there are, and several miles of driving roads have\r\nbeen made, more particularly in the south. Since 1888 many bridges have\r\nbeen built; previous to that year there was none. The larger rivers have\r\nbeen spanned by iron swing-bridges, and the Blanda is crossed by a fixed\r\niron bridge. Postal connexion is maintained with Denmark by steamers,\r\nwhich sail from Copenhagen and call at Leith. Besides, steamers go round\r\nthe island, touching at nearly every port.\r\n\r\n_Religion_.--The Icelanders are Lutherans. For ecclesiastical purposes\r\nthe island is divided into 20 deaneries and 142 parishes, and the\r\naffairs of each ecclesiastical parish are administered by a parish\r\ncouncil, and in each deanery by a district (_hjerað_) council. When a\r\nliving falls vacant, the governor-general of the island, after\r\nconsultation with the bishop, selects three candidates, and from these\r\nthe congregation chooses one, the election being subsequently confirmed\r\nby the governor-general. In the case of certain livings, however, the\r\nelection requires confirmation by the crown. In 1847 a theological\r\nseminary was founded at Reykjavik, and there the majority of the\r\nIcelandic ministry are educated; some, however, are graduates of the\r\nuniversity of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n_Health_.--The public health has greatly improved in modern times; the\r\ndeath-rate of young children has especially diminished. This improvement\r\nis due to greater cleanliness, better dwellings, better nourishment, and\r\nthe increase in the number of doctors. There are now doctors in all\r\nparts of the country, whereas formerly there were hardly any in the\r\nisland. There is a modern asylum for leprosy at Laugarnes near\r\nReykjavik, and a medical school at Reykjavik, opened in 1876. The\r\ngeneral sanitary affairs of the island are under the control of a chief\r\nsurgeon (national physician) who lives in Reykjavik, and has\r\nsuperintendence over the doctors and the medical school.\r\n\r\n_Government_.--According to the constitution granted to Iceland in 1874,\r\nthe king of Denmark shares the legislative power with the Althing, an\r\nassembly of 36 members, 30 of whom are elected by household suffrage,\r\nand 6 nominated by the king. The Althing meets every second year, and\r\nsits in two divisions, the upper and the lower. The upper division\r\nconsists of the 6 members nominated by the king and 6 elected by the\r\nrepresentatives of the people out of their own body. The lower division\r\nconsists of the remaining 24 representative members. The minister for\r\nIceland, who resided in Copenhagen until 1903, when his office was\r\ntransferred to Reykjavik, is responsible to the king and the Althing for\r\nthe maintenance of the constitution, and he submits to the king for\r\nconfirmation the legislative measures proposed by the Althing. The king\r\nappoints a governor-general (_landshöfðingi_) who is resident in the\r\nisland and carries on the government on the responsibility of the\r\nminister. Formerly Iceland was divided into four quarters, the east, the\r\nsouth, the west and north. Now the north and the east are united under\r\none governor, and the south and the west under another. The island is\r\nfurther divided into 18 _sýslur_ (counties), and these again into 169\r\nhreppur (rapes) or poor-law districts. Responsible to the governors are\r\nthe sheriffs (_sýslumenn_), who act as tax gatherers, notaries public\r\nand judges of first instance; the sheriff has in every _hreppur_ an\r\nassistant, called _hreppstjóri_. In every _hreppur_ there is also a\r\nrepresentative committee, who administer the poor laws, and look after\r\nthe general concerns of the _hreppur_. These committees are controlled\r\nby the committees of the _sýslur_ (county boards), and these again are\r\nunder the control of the _amtsráð_ (quarter board), consisting of three\r\nmembers. From the sheriff courts appeals lie to the superior court at\r\nReykjavik, consisting of three judges. Appeals may be taken in all\r\ncriminal cases and most civil cases to the supreme court at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nIceland has her own budget, the Althing having, by the constitution of\r\n1874, the right to vote its own supplies. As the Althing only meets\r\nevery other year, the budget is passed for two years at once. The total\r\nincome and expenditure are each about £70,000 per financial period.\r\nThere is a national reserve fund of about £60,000, but no public debt;\r\nnor is there any contribution for either military or naval purposes.\r\nIceland has her own customs service, but the only import duties levied\r\nare upon spirits, tobacco, coffee and sugar, and in each case the duties\r\nare fairly low.\r\n\r\n_Education_.--Education is pretty widespread amongst the people. In the\r\ntowns and fishing villages there are a few elementary schools, but often\r\nthe children are instructed at home; in some places by peripatetic\r\nteachers. It is incumbent upon the clergy to see that all children are\r\ntaught reading, writing and arithmetic. The people are great readers;\r\nconsidering the number of the inhabitants, books and periodicals have a\r\nvery extensive circulation. Eighteen newspapers are issued (once and\r\ntwice a week), besides several journals, and Iceland has always been\r\ndistinguished for her native literature. At Reykjavik there are a Latin\r\nschool, a medical school and a theological school; at Mödruvellir and\r\nHafnarfjörðr, modern high schools (_Realschulen_); and in addition to\r\nthese there are four agricultural schools, a school of navigation, and\r\nthree girls' schools. The national library at Reykjavik contains some\r\n40,000 volumes and 3000 MSS. At the same place there is also a valuable\r\narchaeological collection. Amongst the learned societies are the\r\nIcelandic Literary Society (_Bokmentafjelag_), the society of the\r\nFriends of the People, and the Archaeological Society of Reykjavik.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Among numerous works of Dr Thorvald Thoroddsen, see\r\n  _Geschichte der Islands Geographie_ (Leipzig, 1898); and the following\r\n  articles in _Geografisk Tidskrift_ (Copenhagen): \"Om Islands\r\n  geografiske og geologiske Undersögelse\" (1893); \"Islandske Fjorde og\r\n  Bugter\" (1901); \"Geog. og geol.

T.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nShortly after the discovery of Iceland by the Scandinavian, c. 850 (it\r\nhad long been inhabited by a small colony of Irish Culdees), a stream of\r\nimmigration set in towards it, which lasted for sixty years, and\r\nresulted in the establishment of some 4000 homesteads. In this\r\nimmigration three distinct streams can be traced. (1) About 870-890 four\r\ngreat noblemen from Norway, Ingolf, Ketil Hæng, Skalla-Grim and Thorolf,\r\nsettled with their dependants in the south-west of the new found land.\r\n(2) In 890-900 there came from the western Islands Queen Aud, widow of\r\nOlaf the White, king of Dublin, preceded and followed by a number of her\r\nkinsmen and relations (many like herself being Christians), Helgi\r\nBiolan, Biorn the Eastern, Helgi the Lean, Ketil the Foolish, &c., who\r\nsettled the best land in the island (west, north-west and north), and\r\nfounded families who long swayed its destinies. There also came from the\r\nWestern Islands a fellowship of vikings seeking a free home in the\r\nnorth. They had colonized the west in the viking times; they had \"fought\r\nat Hafursfirth,\" helping their stay-at-home kinsmen against the\r\ncentralization of the great head-king, who, when he had crushed\r\nopposition in Norway, followed up his victory by compelling them to flee\r\nor bow to his rule. Such were Ingimund the Old, Geirmund Hellskin, Thord\r\nBeardie (who had wed St. Edmund's granddaughter,) Audun Shackle,\r\nBryniulf the Old, Uni, to whom Harold promised the earldom of the new\r\nland if he could make the settlers acknowledge him as king (a hopeless\r\nproject), and others by whom the north-west, north and east were almost\r\ncompletely \"claimed.\" (3) In 900-930 a few more incomers direct from\r\nNorway completed the settlement of the south, north-east and south-east.\r\nAmong them were Earl Hrollaug (half-brother of Hrolf Ganger and of the\r\nfirst earl of Orkney), Hialti, Hrafnkell Frey's priest, and the sons of\r\nAsbiorn. Fully three-quarters of the land was settled from the west, and\r\namong these immigrants there was no small proportion of Irish blood. In\r\n1100 there were 4500 franklins, i.e. about 50,000 souls.\r\n\r\n_Table of Icelandic Literature and History._\r\n\r\n

+------------+---------------------------+-------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n  Organization.\r\n\r\nThe unit of Icelandic politics was the homestead with its franklin-owner\r\n(_buendi_), its primal organization the hundred-moot (_thing_), its tie\r\nthe goðorð (godar) or chieftainship. The chief who had led a band of\r\nkinsmen and dependants to the new land, taken a \"claim\" there, and\r\nparcelled it out among them, naturally became their leader, presiding as\r\npriest at the temple feasts and sacrifices of heathen times, acting as\r\nspeaker of their moot, and as their representative towards the\r\nneighbouring chiefs. He was not a feudal lord nor a local sheriff, for\r\nany franklin could change his goðorð when he would, and the rights of\r\n\"judgment by peers\" were in full use; moreover, the office could be\r\nbequeathed, sold, divided or pledged by the possessor; still the goði\r\nhad considerable power as long as the commonwealth lasted.\r\n\r\nDisputes between neighbouring chiefs and their clients, and uncertainty\r\nas to the law, brought about the _Constitution of Ulfliot_ (c. 930),\r\nwhich appointed a central moot for the whole island, the Althing, and a\r\nspeaker to speak a single \"law\" (principally that followed by the\r\nGula-moot in Norway); the _Reforms of Thord Gellir_ (964), settling a\r\nfixed number of moots and chieftaincies, dividing the island into four\r\nquarters (thus characterized by Ari: north, thickest settled, most\r\nfamous; east, first completely settled; south, best land and greatest\r\nchiefs; west, remarkable for noble families), to each of which a\r\nhead-court, the \"quarter-court,\" was assigned; and the _Innovations of\r\nSkapti_ (ascribed in the saga to Nial) _the Law-Speaker_ (d. 1030), who\r\nset up a \"fifth court\" as the ultimate tribunal in criminal matters, and\r\nstrengthened the community against the chiefs. But here constitutional\r\ngrowth ceased: the law-making body made few and unimportant\r\nmodifications of custom; the courts were still too weak for the chiefs\r\nwho misused and defied them; the speaker's power was not sufficiently\r\nsupported to enable him to be any more than a highly respected lord\r\nchief justice, whereas he ought to have become a justiza if anarchy was\r\nto be avoided; even the ecclesiastical innovations, while they secured\r\npeace for a time, provoked in the end the struggles which put an end to\r\nthe commonwealth.\r\n\r\nChristianity was introduced c. 1000. Tithes were established in 1096,\r\nand an ecclesiastical code made c. 1125. The first disputes about the\r\njurisdiction of the clergy were moved by Gudmund in the 13th century,\r\nbringing on a civil war, while the questions of patronage and rights\r\nover glebe and mortmainland occupied Bishop Arni and his adversaries\r\nfifty years afterwards, when the land was under Norwegian viceroys and\r\nNorwegian law. For the civil wars broke down the great houses who had\r\nmonopolized the chieftaincies; and after violent struggles (in which the\r\nSturlungs of the first generation perished at Orlygstad, 1238, and\r\nReykiaholt, 1241, while of the second generation Thord Kakali was called\r\naway by the king in 1250, and Thorgils Skardi slain in 1258) the\r\nsubmission of the island to Norway quarter after quarter, took place in\r\n1262-1264, under Gizur's auspices, and the old Common Law was replaced\r\nby the New Norse Code \"Ironside\" in 1271.\r\n\r\nThe political life and law of the old days is abundantly illustrated in\r\nthe sagas (especially Eyrbyggia, Hamsa-Thori, Reykdæla, Hrafnkell, and\r\nNiala), the two collections of law-scrolls (_Codex Regius_, c. 1235, and\r\n_Stadarhol's Book_, c. 1271), the Libellus, the Liberfragments, and the\r\nLandnamabók of Ari, and the Diplomatarium. K. Maurer has made the\r\nsubject his own in his _Beiträge, Island, Grágás_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe medieval Icelandic church had two bishoprics, Skalholt (S., W., and\r\nE.) 1056, and Holar (N.) 1106, and about 175 parishes (two-thirds of\r\nwhich belonged to the southern bishopric). They belonged to the\r\nmetropolitan see of Bremen, then to Lund, lastly to Nidaros, 1237. There\r\nwere several religious foundations: Thingore (founded 1133), Thwera\r\n(1155), Hitardale (c. 1166), Kirkby Nunnery (1184), Stad Nunnery (1296),\r\nand Saurby (c. 1200) were Benedictine, while Ver (1168), Flatey after\r\nHolyfell (1172), Videy (1226), Madderfield Priory (1296), and Skrid\r\nPriory (14th century) were Augustinian. The bishops, elected by the\r\npeople at the Althing till 1237, enjoyed considerable power; two,\r\nThorlak of Skalholt and John of Holar, were publicly voted saints at the\r\nAlthing, and one, Gudmund, received the title of \"Good\" by decree of the\r\nbishop and chapter. Full details as to ecclesiastical history will be\r\nfound in the _Biskupasögur_ (edited by Dr Vigfusson).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mode of life.\r\n\r\nIceland was not agricultural but pastoral, depending upon flocks Mode of\r\nand herds for subsistence, for, though rye and other grain would grow in\r\nfavoured localities, the hay, self-sown, was the only regular crop. In\r\nsome districts the fisheries and fowling were of importance, but\r\nnine-tenths of the population lived by their sheep and cattle. Life on\r\neach homestead was regularly portioned out: out door occupations--fishing,\r\nshepherding, fowling, and the hay-making and fuel-gathering--occupying the\r\nsummer; while indoor business--weaving, tool-making, &c.--filled up the\r\nlong winter. The year was broken by the spring feasts and moots, the great\r\nAlthing meeting at midsummer, the marriage and arval gatherings after the\r\nsummer, and the long yule feasts at midwinter. There were but two degrees\r\nof men, free and unfree, though only the franklins had any political\r\npower; and, from the nature of the life, social intercourse was\r\nunrestrained and unfettered; goði and thrall lived the same lives, ate the\r\nsame food, spoke the same tongue, and differed little in clothing or\r\nhabits. The thrall had a house of his own and was rather villein or serf\r\nthan slave, having rights and a legal price by law. During the heathen\r\ndays many great chiefs passed part of their lives in Norway at the king's\r\ncourt, but after the establishment of Christianity in Iceland they kept\r\nmore at home, visiting the continent, however, for purposes of state,\r\nsuits with clergy, &c. Trade was from the first almost entirely in foreign\r\n(Norse) hands.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a church system brought little change. The great\r\nfamilies put their members into orders, and so continued to enjoy the\r\nprofits of the land which they had given to the church; the priests\r\nmarried and otherwise behaved like the franklins around them in everyday\r\nmatters, farming, trading, going to law like laymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Effects of the Union.\r\n\r\nLife in the commonwealth was turbulent and anarchic, but free and\r\nvaried; it produced men of mark, and fostered bravery, adventure and\r\nprogress. But on the union with Norway all this ceased, and there was\r\nleft but a low dead level of poor peasant proprietors careless of all\r\nsave how to live by as little labour as possible, and pay as few taxes\r\nas they could to their foreign rulers. The island received a foreign\r\ngovernor (_Earl_, _Hirdstjori_ or _Stiptamtsmadr_ as he was successively\r\ncalled), and was parcelled out into counties (_sýslur_), administered by\r\nsheriffs (_sýslumadr_) appointed by the king. A royal court took the\r\nplace of the Althing courts; the local business of the local things was\r\ncarried out by the (_hreppstjóri_) bailiff, a subordinate of the\r\nsheriff; and the goðorð, things, quarter-courts, trial by jury, &c.,\r\nwere swept away by these innovations. The power of the crown was\r\nincreased by the confiscation of the great Sturlung estates, which were\r\nunderleased to farmers, while the early falling off of the Norse trade\r\nthreatened to deprive the island of the means of existence; for the\r\ngreat epidemics and eruptions of the 14th century had gravely attacked\r\nits pastoral wealth and ruined much of its pasture and fishery.\r\n\r\nThe union of the Three Crowns transferred the practical rule of Iceland\r\nto Denmark in 1280, and the old Treaty of Union, by which the island had\r\nreserved its essential rights, was disregarded by the absolute Danish\r\nmonarchs; but, though new taxation was imposed, it was rather their\r\ncareless neglect than their too active interference that damaged\r\nIceland's interests. But for an English trade, which sprang up out of\r\nthe half-smuggling, half-buccaneering enterprise of the Bristol\r\nmerchants, the island would have fared badly, for during the whole of\r\nthe 15th century their trade with England, exporting sulphur, eiderdown\r\n(of which the English taught them the value), wool, and salt stock-fish,\r\nand importing as before wood, iron, honey, wine, grain and flax goods,\r\nwas their only link with the outer world. This period of Iceland's\r\nexistence is eventless: she had got peace but with few of its blessings;\r\nall spirit seemed to have died with the commonwealth; even shepherding\r\nand such agriculture as there had been sank to a lower stage; wagons,\r\nploughs and carts went out of use and knowledge; architecture in timber\r\nbecame a lost art, and the fine carved and painted halls of the heathen\r\ndays were replaced by turf-walled barns half sunk in the earth; the\r\nlarge decked luggers of the old days gave way to small undecked\r\nfishing-boats.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation in Iceland wakened men's minds, but it left their\r\ncircumstances little changed. Though the fires of martyrdom were never\r\nlighted in Iceland, the story of the easily accepted Reformation is not\r\naltogether a pleasant one. When it was accomplished, the little knot of\r\nable men who came to the front did much in preserving the records of the\r\npast, while Odd and Hallgrim exhibit the noblest impulses of their time.\r\nWhile there was this revolution in religion a social and political\r\nrevolution never came to Iceland. The Hanse trade replaced the English\r\nfor the worse; and the Danish monopoly which succeeded it when the\r\nDanish kings began to act again with vigour was still less profitable.\r\nThe glebes and hospital lands were a fresh power in the hands of the\r\ncrown, and the subservient Lutheran clergy became the most powerful\r\nclass in the island, while the system of under-leasing at rackrent and\r\nshort lease with unsecured tenant right extended over at least a quarter\r\nof the better land.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Decadence.\r\n\r\nA new plague, that of the English, Gascon and Algerine pirates, marked\r\nthe close of the 16th century and opening of the 17th, causing\r\nwidespread panic and some devastation in 1579, 1613-1616 and 1627.\r\nNothing points more to the helplessness of the natives' condition than\r\ntheir powerlessness against these foes. But the 18th century is the most\r\ngloomy in Iceland's annals. Smallpox, famine, sheep disease, and the\r\neruptions of 1765 and 1783 follow each other in terrible succession.\r\nAgainst such visitations, which reduced the population by about a\r\nfourth, little could be done. The few literary men, whose work was done\r\nand whose books were published abroad, were only concerned with the\r\npast, and Jon Vidalin is the one man of mark, beside Eggert Olafsson,\r\nwho worked and wrote for his own generation.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Modern times.\r\n\r\nGradually the ideas which were agitating Europe spread through\r\nScandinavia into Iceland, and its claims were more respectfully listened\r\nto. The continental system, which, by its leading to the blockade of\r\nDenmark, threatened to starve Iceland, was neutralized by special action\r\nof the British government. Trade and fishery grew a little brisker, and\r\nat length the turn came.\r\n\r\nThe rationalistic movement, headed by Magnus Stephenson, a patriotic,\r\nnarrow-minded lawyer, did little good as far as church reform went, but\r\nwas accompanied by a more successful effort to educate the people. A\r\nUseful Knowledge Society was formed and did some honest work. Newspapers\r\nand periodicals were published, and the very stir which the\r\necclesiastical disputes encouraged did good. When free trade came, and\r\nwhen the free constitution of Denmark had produced its legitimate\r\neffects, the endeavours of a few patriots such as Jon Sigurdsson were\r\nable to push on the next generation a step further. Questions of a\r\nmodern political complexion arose; the cattle export controversy and the\r\ngreat home rule struggle began. After thirty years' agitation home rule\r\nwas conceded in 1874 (see above, _Government_).     (F. Y. P.)\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT LITERATURE\r\n\r\n_Poetry._--Iceland has always borne a high renown for song, but has\r\nnever produced a poet of the highest order, the qualities which in other\r\nlands were most sought for and admired in poetry being in Iceland\r\nlavished on the saga, a prose epic, while Icelandic poetry is to be\r\nrated very high for the one quality which its authors have ever aimed\r\nat--melody of sound. To these generalizations there are few exceptions,\r\nthough Icelandic literature includes a group of poems which possess\r\nqualities of high imagination, deep pathos, fresh love of nature,\r\npassionate dramatic power, and noble simplicity of language which\r\nIcelandic poetry lacks. The solution is that these poems do not belong\r\nto Iceland at all. They are the poetry of the \"Western Islands.\"\r\n\r\nIt was among the Scandinavian colonists of the British coasts that in\r\nthe first generations after the colonization of Iceland therefrom a\r\nmagnificent school of poetry arose, to which we owe works that for power\r\nand beauty can be paralleled in no Teutonic language till centuries\r\nafter their date. To this school, which is totally distinct from the\r\nIcelandic, ran its own course apart and perished before the 13th\r\ncentury, the following works belong (of their authors we have scarcely a\r\nname or two; their dates can be rarely exactly fixed, but they lie\r\nbetween the beginning of the 9th and the end of the 10th centuries),\r\nclassified into groups:--\r\n\r\n  (a) The _Helgi_ trilogy (last third lost save a few verses, but\r\n  preserved in prose in _Hromund Gripsson's Saga_), the _Raising of\r\n  Anganty_ and _Death of Hialmar_ (in _Hervarar Saga_), the fragments of\r\n  a _Volsung Lay_ (_Volsungakiraða_) (part interpolated in earlier\r\n  poems, part underlying the prose in _Volsunga Saga_), all by one poet,\r\n  to whom Dr Vigfusson would also ascribe _Völuspá_, _Vegtamskviða_,\r\n  _Þrymskviða_, _Grötta Song_ and _Völundarkviða_.\r\n\r\n  (b) The Dramatic Poems:--_Flyting of Loki_, the _För Skirnis_, the\r\n  _Harbarðslioð_ and several fragments, all one man's work, to whose\r\n  school belong, probably, the _Lay_ underlying the story of Ivar's\r\n  death in _Skioldunga Saga_.\r\n\r\n  (c) The Didactic Poetry:--_Grímnismál_, _Vafpruðnismál_, _Alvíssmal_,\r\n  &c.\r\n\r\n  (d) The Genealogical and Mythological Poems:--_Hyndluljoð_ written for\r\n  one of the Haurda-Kari family, so famous in the Orkneys; _Ynglingatal_\r\n  and _Haustlong_, by Thiodolf of Hvin; _Rig's Thul_, &c.\r\n\r\n  (e) The Dirges and Battle Songs--such as that on Hafur-firth Battle\r\n  _Hrafnsmal_, by Thiodolf of Hvin or Thorbjörn Hornklofi, shortly after\r\n  870; Eirik's Dirge (_Eíríksmál_) between 950 and 969; the _Dart-Lay on\r\n  Clontarf Battle_ (1014); _Bíarka-mal_ (fragments of which we have, and\r\n  paraphrase of more is found in _Hrolf Kraki's Saga_ and in Saxo).\r\n\r\n  There are also fragments of poems in _Half's Saga_, _Asmund\r\n  Kappa-Bana's Saga_, in the Latin verses of Saxo, and the Shield Lays\r\n  (_Ragnarsdrapa_) by Bragi, &c., of this school, which closes with the\r\n  _Sun-Song_, a powerful Christian Dantesque poem, recalling some of the\r\n  early compositions of the Irish Church, and with the 12th-century _Lay\r\n  of Ragnar_, _Lay of Starkad_, _The Proverb Song_ (_Havamal_) and\r\n  _Krakumal_, to which we may add those singular Gloss-poems, the\r\n  _Þulur_, which also belong to the Western Isles.\r\n\r\n  To Greenland, Iceland's farthest colony, founded in the 10th century,\r\n  we owe the two _Lays of Atli_, and probably _Hymiskvtiða_, which,\r\n  though of a weirder, harsher cast, yet belong to the Western Isles\r\n  school and not to Iceland.\r\n\r\nIn form all these poems belong to two or three classes:--_kviða_, an\r\nepic \"cantilena\"; _tál_, a genealogical poem; _drapa_, songs of praise,\r\n&c., written in modifications of the old Teutonic metre which we know in\r\nBeowulf; _galdr_ and _lokkr_, spell and charm songs in a more lyric\r\nmeasure; and _mál_, a dialogue poem, and _liod_, a lay, in elegiac\r\nmeasure suited to the subject.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of this Western school are no doubt the result of\r\nthe contact of Scandinavian colonists of the viking-tide, living lives\r\nof the wildest adventure, with an imaginative and civilized race, that\r\nexercised upon them a very strong and lasting influence (the effects of\r\nwhich were also felt in Iceland, but in a different way). The frequent\r\nintermarriages which mingled the best families of either race are\r\nsufficient proof of the close communion of Northmen and Celts in the 9th\r\nand 10th centuries, while there are in the poems themselves traces of\r\nCeltic mythology, language and manners.[6]\r\n\r\nWhen one turns to the early poetry of the Scandinavian continent,\r\npreserved in the rune-staves on the memorial stones of Sweden, Norway\r\nand Denmark, in the didactic _Havamal_, the _Great Volsung Lay_ (i.e.\r\nSigurd II., Fafnis's Lay, Sigrdrifa's Lay) and _Hamdismal_, all\r\ncontinental, and all entirely consonant to the remains of Old English\r\npoetry in metre, feeling and treatment, one can see that it is with this\r\nschool that the Icelandic \"makers\" are in sympathy, and that from it\r\ntheir verse naturally descends. While shrewdness, plain\r\nstraightforwardness, and a certain stern way of looking at life are\r\ncommon to both, the Icelandic school adds a complexity of structure and\r\nornament, an elaborate mythological and enigmatical phraseology, and a\r\nregularity of rhyme, assonance, luxuriance, quantity and\r\nsyllabification, which it caught from the Latin and Celtic poets, and\r\nadapted with exquisite ingenuity to its own main object, that of\r\nsecuring the greatest possible beauty of sound.\r\n\r\nThe first generations of Icelandic poets resemble in many ways the later\r\ntroubadours; the books of the kings and the sagas are full of their\r\nstrange lives. Men of good birth (nearly always, too, of Celtic blood on\r\none side at least), they leave Iceland young and attach themselves to\r\nthe kings and earls of the north, living in their courts as their\r\nhenchmen, sharing their adventures in weal and woe, praising their\r\nvictories, and hymning their deaths if they did not fall by their\r\nsides--men of quick passion, unhappy in their loves, jealous of rival\r\npoets and of their own fame, ever ready to answer criticism with a\r\nsatire or with a sword-thrust, but clinging through all to their art, in\r\nwhich they attained most marvellous skill.\r\n\r\nSuch men were Egil, the foe of Eirik Bloodaxe and the friend of\r\nÆthelstan; Kormak, the hot-headed champion; Eyvind, King Haakon's poet,\r\ncalled Skaldaspillir, because he copied in his dirge over that king the\r\nolder and finer _Eíríksmál_; Gunnlaug, who sang at Æthelred's court, and\r\nfell at the hands of a brother bard, Hrafn; Hallfred, Olaf Tryggvason's\r\npoet, who lies in Iona by the side of Macbeth; Sighvat, Saint Olafs\r\nhenchman, most prolific of all his comrades; Thormod, Coalbrow's poet,\r\nwho died singing after Sticklestad battle; Ref, Ottar the Black, Arnor\r\nthe earls' poet, and, of those whose poetry was almost confined to\r\nIceland, Gretti, Biorn the Hitdale champion, and the two model Icelandic\r\nmasters, Einar Skulason and Markus the Lawman, both of the 12th century.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to do more here than mention the names of the most\r\nfamous of the long roll of poets which are noted in the works of Snorri\r\nand in the two _Skalda-tal_. They range from the rough and noble pathos\r\nof Egil, the mystic obscurity of Kormak, the pride and grief of\r\nHallfred, and the marvellous, fluency of Sighvat, to the florid\r\nintricacy of Einar and Markus.\r\n\r\nThe art of poetry stood to the Icelanders in lieu of music; scarcely any\r\nprominent man but knew how to turn a mocking or laudatory stanza, and\r\ndown to the fall of the commonwealth the accomplishment was in high\r\nrequest. In the literary age the chief poets belong to the great\r\nSturlung family, Snorri and his two nephews, Sturla and Olaf, the White\r\nPoet, being the most famous \"makers\" of their day. Indeed, it is in\r\nSnorri's _Edda_, a poetic grammar of a very perfect kind, that the best\r\nexamples of the whole of northern poetry are to be found. The last part,\r\n_Hattatal_, a treatise on metre, was written for Earl Skuli about 1222,\r\nin imitation of Earl Rognvald and Hall's _Hattalykill_ (_Clavis\r\nmetrica_) of 1150. The second part, _Skaldskapar-mal_, a gradus of\r\nsynonyms and epithets, which contains over 240 quotations from 65 poets,\r\nand 10 anonymous lays--a treasury of verse--was composed c. 1230. The\r\nfirst part, an exquisite sketch of northern mythology, _Gylfa-ginning_,\r\nwas probably prefixed to the whole later. There is some of Sturla's\r\npoetry in his _Islendinga Saga_, and verses of Snorri occur in the\r\n_Grammatical Treatise_ on figures of speech, &c., of Olaf, which\r\ncontains about one hundred and forty quotations from various authors,\r\nand was written about 1250.\r\n\r\nBesides those sources, the _Kings' Lives of Snorri_ and later authors\r\ncontain a great deal of verse by Icelandic poets. King Harold\r\nSigurdsson, who fell at Stamford Bridge 1066, was both a good critic and\r\ncomposed himself. Many tales are told of him and his poet visitors and\r\nhenchmen. The Icelandic sagas also comprise much verse which is partly\r\ngenuine, partly the work of the 12th and 13th century editors. Thus\r\nthere are genuine pieces in _Nial's Saga_ (chaps. 34, 78, 103, 126,\r\n146), in _Eyrbyggia_, _Laxdæla_, _Egil's Saga_ (part only), _Grettla_\r\n(two and a half stanzas, cf. _Landnamabók_), _Biorn's Saga_, _Gunnlaug's\r\nSaga_, _Havard's Saga_, _Kormak's Saga_, _Viga-Glum's Saga_, _Erik the\r\nRed's Saga_ and _Fostbrædra Saga_. In _Nial's_, _Gisli's_ and\r\n_Droplaug's Sons' Sagas_ there is good verse of a later poet, and in\r\nmany sagas worthless rubbish foisted in as ornamental.\r\n\r\nTo these may be added two or three works of a semi-literary kind,\r\ncomposed by learned men, not by heroes and warriors. Such are\r\n_Konunga-tál_, _Hugsvinnsmál_ (a paraphrase of Cato's Distichs),\r\n_Merlin's Prophecy_ (paraphrased from Geoffrey of Monmouth by Gunnlaug\r\nthe monk), _Jomsvikinga-drapa_ (by Bishop Ketil), and the\r\n_Islendinga-drapa_, which has preserved brief notices of several lost\r\nsagas concerning Icelandic worthies, with which _Gudmundar-drapa_,\r\nthough of the 14th century, may be also placed.\r\n\r\nJust as the change of law gave the death-blow to an already perishing\r\ncommonwealth, so the rush of medieval influence, which followed the\r\nunion with Norway, completed a process which had been in force since the\r\nend of the 11th century, when it overthrew the old Icelandic poetry in\r\nfavour of the rimur.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the _danz_, ballads (or _fornkvædi_, as they are now\r\ncalled) for singing, with a burden, usually relating to a love-tale,\r\nwhich were immensely popular with the people and performed by whole\r\ncompanies at weddings, yule feasts and the like, had relegated the\r\nregular Icelandic poetry to more serious events or to the more\r\ncultivated of the chiefs. But these \"jigs,\" as the Elizabethans would\r\nhave called them, dissatisfied the popular ear in one way: they were,\r\nlike old English ballads, which they closely resembled, in rhyme, but\r\nvoid of alliteration, and accordingly they were modified and replaced by\r\nthe \"rimur,\" the staple literary product of the 15th century. These were\r\nrhymed but also alliterative, in regular form, with prologue or\r\n_mansong_ (often the prettiest part of the whole), main portion telling\r\nthe tale (mostly derived in early days from the French romances of the\r\nCarlovingian, Arthurian or Alexandrian cycles, or from the mythic or\r\nskrök-sögur), and epilogue. Their chief value to us lies in their having\r\npreserved versions of several French poems now lost, and in their\r\nevidence as to the feelings and bent of Icelanders in the \"Dark Age\" of\r\nthe island's history. The ring and melody which they all possess is\r\ntheir chief beauty.\r\n\r\nOf the earliest, _Olafsrima_, by Einar Gilsson (c. 1350), and the best,\r\nthe Aristophanic _Skída-rima_ (c. 1430), by Einar Fostri, the names may\r\nbe given. Rimur on sacred subjects was called \"diktur\"; of these, on the\r\nlegends of the saints' lives, many remain. The most notable of its class\r\nis the _Lilia_ of Eystein Asgrimsson, a monk of Holyfell (c. 1350), a\r\nmost \"sweet sounding song.\" Later the poems of the famous Jon Arason (b.\r\n1484), last Catholic bishop of Holar (c. 1530), _Liomr_ (\"gleam\") and\r\n_Píslargrátr_ (\"passion-tears\"), deserve mention. Arason is also\r\ncelebrated as having introduced printing into Iceland.\r\n\r\nTaste has sunk since the old days; but still this rimur poetry is\r\npopular and genuine. Moreover, the very prosaic and artificial verse of\r\nSturla and the last of the old school deserved the oblivion which came\r\nover them, as a casual perusal of the stanzas scattered through\r\n_Islendinga_ will prove. It is interesting to notice that a certain\r\nnumber of _kenningar_ (poetical paraphrases) have survived from the old\r\nschool even to the present day, though the mass of them have happily\r\nperished. The change in the _phonesis_ of the language is well\r\nillustrated by the new metres as compared with the old Icelandic\r\n_drott-kvædi_ in its varied forms. Most of the older rimur and diktur\r\nare as yet unprinted. Many of the _fornkvædi_ are printed in a volume of\r\nthe old _Nordiske Litteralur-Samfund_.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the Reformation was deeply felt in Icelandic literature,\r\nboth prose and verse. The name of Hallgrim Petursson, whose\r\n_Passion-hymns_, \"the flower of all Icelandic poetry,\" have been the\r\nmost popular composition in the language, is foremost of all writers\r\nsince the second change of faith. The gentle sweetness of thought, and\r\nthe exquisite harmony of wording in his poems, more than justify the\r\npopular verdict. His _Hymns_ were finished in 1660 and published in\r\n1666, two great Protestant poets thus being contemporaries. A collection\r\nof Reformation hymns, adapted, many of them, from the German, the\r\n_Holar-book_, had preceded them in 1619. There was a good deal of\r\nverse-writing of a secular kind, far inferior in every way, during this\r\nperiod. In spite of the many physical distresses that weighed upon the\r\nisland, ballads (_fornkvædi_) were still written, ceasing about 1750,\r\nrimur composed, and more elaborate compositions published.\r\n\r\nThe most notable names are those of the improvisatore Stephen the\r\nBlind; Thorlak Gudbrandsson, author of _Ulfar-Rímur_, d. 1707; John\r\nMagnusson, who wrote _Hristafla_, a didactic poem; Stefan Olafsson,\r\ncomposer of psalms, rimur, &c., d. 1688; Gunnar Pálsson, the author of\r\n_Gunnarslag_, often printed with the Eddic poems, c. 1791; and Eggert\r\nOlafsson, traveller, naturalist and patriot, whose untimely death in\r\n1768 was a great loss to his country. His _Bunadar-balkr_, a Georgic\r\nwritten, like Tusser's _Points_, with a practical view of raising the\r\nstate of agriculture, has always been much prized. Paul Vidalin's\r\nditties are very naïve and clever.\r\n\r\nOf later poets, down to more recent times, perhaps the best was Sigurd\r\nof Broadfirth, many of whose prettiest poems were composed in Greenland\r\nlike those of Jon Biarnisson before him, c. 1750; John Thorlaksson's\r\ntranslation of Milton's great epic into Eddic verse is praiseworthy in\r\nintention, but, as may be imagined, falls far short of its aim. He also\r\nturned Pope's _Essay on Man_ and Klopstock's _Messiah_ into Icelandic.\r\nBenedikt Gröndal tried the same experiment with Homer in his _Ilion's\r\nKvædi_, c. 1825. There is a fine prose translation of the _Odyssey_ by\r\nSweinbjörn Egillson, the lexicographer, both faithful and poetic in high\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n_Sagas._--The real strength of ancient Icelandic literature is shown in\r\nits most indigenous growth, the \"Saga\" (see also SAGA). This is, in its\r\npurest form, the life of a hero, composed in regular form, governed by\r\nfixed rules, and intended for oral recitation. It bears the strongest\r\nlikeness to the epic in all save its unversified form; in both are\r\nfound, as fixed essentials, simplicity of plot, chronological order of\r\nevents, set phrases used even in describing the restless play of emotion\r\nor the changeful fortunes of a fight or a storm, while in both the\r\nabsence of digression, comment or intrusion of the narrator's person is\r\ninvariably maintained. The saga grew up in the quieter days which\r\nfollowed the change of faith (1002), when the deeds of the great\r\nfamilies' heroes were still cherished by their descendants, and the\r\nexploits of the great kings of Norway and Denmark handed down with\r\nreverence. Telling of stories was a recognized form of entertainment at\r\nall feasts and gatherings, and it was the necessity of the reciter which\r\ngradually worked them into a regular form, by which the memory was\r\nrelieved and the artistic features of the story allowed to be more\r\ncarefully elaborated. That this form was so perfect must be attributed\r\nto Irish influence, without which indeed there would have been a saga,\r\nbut not the same saga. It is to the west that the best sagas belong; it\r\nis to the west that nearly every classic writer whose name we know\r\nbelongs; and it is precisely in the west that the admixture of Irish\r\nblood is greatest. In comparing the Irish tales with the saga, there\r\nwill be felt deep divergencies in matter, style and taste, the richness\r\nof one contrasting with the chastened simplicity of the other; the one's\r\nhalf-comic, half-earnest bombast is wholly unlike the other's grim\r\nhumour; the marvellous, so unearthly in the one, is almost credible in\r\nthe other; but in both are the keen grasp of character, the biting\r\nphrase, the love of action and the delight in blood which almost assumes\r\nthe garb of a religious passion.\r\n\r\nWhen the saga had been fixed by a generation or two of oral reciters, it\r\nwas written down; and this stereotyped the form, so that afterwards when\r\nliterary works were composed by learned men (such as Abbot Karl's\r\n_Swerri's Saga_ and Sturla's _Islendinga_) the same style was adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Icelandic sagas.\r\n\r\nTaking first the sagas relating to Icelanders, of which some thirty-five\r\nor forty remain out of thrice that number, they were first written down\r\nbetween 1140 and 1220, in the generation which succeeded Ari and felt\r\nthe impulse his books had given to writing, on separate scrolls, no\r\ndoubt mainly for the reciter's convenience; they then went through the\r\ndifferent phases which such popular compositions have to pass in all\r\nlands--editing and compounding (1220-1260), padding and amplifying\r\n(1260-1300), and finally collection in large MSS. (14th century). Sagas\r\nexist showing all these phases, some primitive and rough, some refined\r\nand beautified, some diluted and weakened, according as their copyists\r\nhave been faithful, artistic or foolish; for the first generation of\r\nMSS. have all perished. We have also complex sagas put together in the\r\n13th century out of the scrolls relating to a given locality, such a\r\ngroup as still exists untouched in _Vapnfirdinga_ being fused into such\r\na saga as _Niala_ or _Laxdæla_. Of the authors nothing is known; we can\r\nonly guess that some belong to the Sturlung school. According to subject\r\nthey fall into two classes, those relating to the older generation\r\nbefore Christianity and those telling of St Olaf's contemporaries; only\r\ntwo fall into a third generation.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the sagas of the west, most perfect in style and form,\r\nthe earliest in subject is that of _Gold-Thori_ (c. 930), whose\r\nadventurous career it relates; _Hensa-Þorissaga_ tells of the burning of\r\nBlund-Ketil, a noble chief, an event which led to Thord Gelli's reforms\r\nnext year (c. 964); _Gislasaga_ (960-980) tells of the career and death\r\nof that ill-fated outlaw; it is beautifully written, and the verses by\r\nthe editor (13th century) are good and appropriate; _Hord's Saga_ (980)\r\nis the life of a band of outlaws on Whalesfirth, and especially of their\r\nleader Hord. Of later subject are the sagas of _Havard_ and his revenge\r\nfor his son, murdered by a neighbouring chief (997-1002); of the\r\n_Heiðarirgasaga_ (990-1014), a typical tale of a great blood feud,\r\nwritten in the most primitive prose; of Gunnlaug and Hrafn\r\n(_Gunnlaugssaga Ormstungu_, 980-1008), the rival poets and their\r\nill-starred love. The verse in this saga is important and interesting.\r\nTo the west also belong the three great complex sagas _Egla_,\r\n_Eyrbyggia_ and _Laxdæla_. The first (870-980), after noticing the\r\nmigration of the father and grandfather of the hero poet Egil, and the\r\norigin of the feud between them and the kings of Norway, treats fully of\r\nEgil's career, his enmity with Eirik Bloodaxe, his service with\r\nÆthelstan, and finally, after many adventures abroad, of his latter days\r\nin Iceland at Borg, illustrating very clearly what manner of men those\r\ngreat settlers and their descendants were, and the feelings of pride and\r\nfreedom which led them to Iceland. The style is that of Snorri, who had\r\nhimself dwelt at Borg. _Eyrbyggia_ (890-1031) is the saga of politics,\r\nthe most loosely woven of all the compound stories. It includes a mass\r\nof information on the law, religion, traditions, &c., of the heathen\r\ndays in Iceland, and the lives of Eric, the real discoverer of\r\nGreenland, Biorn of Broadwick, a famous chief, and Snorri, the greatest\r\nstatesman of his day. Dr Vigfusson would ascribe its editing and\r\ncompletion to Sturla the Lawman, c. 1250. _Laxdæla_ (910-1026) is the\r\nsaga of Romance. Its heroine Gudrun is the most famous of all Icelandic\r\nladies. Her love for Kiartan the poet, and his career abroad, his\r\nbetrayal by his friend Bolli, the sad death of Kiartan at his hands, the\r\nrevenge taken for him on Bolli, whose slayers are themselves afterwards\r\nput to death, and the end of Gudrun, who becomes an anchorite after her\r\nstormy life, make up the pith of the story. The contrast of the\r\ncharacters, the rich style and fine dialogue which are so remarkable in\r\nthis saga, have much in common with the best works of the Sturlung\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nOf the north there are the sagas of _Kormak_ (930-960), most primitive\r\nof all, a tale of a wild poet's love and feuds, containing many notices\r\nof the heathen times; of _Vatzdælasaga_ (890-980), relating to the\r\nsettlement and the chief family in Waterdale; of _Hallfred_ the poet\r\n(996-1014), narrating his fortune at King Olafs court, his love affairs\r\nin Iceland, and finally his death and burial at Iona; of _Reyk-dæla_\r\n(990), which preserves the lives of Askell and his son Viga-Skuti; of\r\n_Svarf-dæla_ (980-990), a cruel, coarse story of the old days, with some\r\ngood scenes in it, unfortunately imperfect, chapters 1-10 being forged;\r\nof _Viga-Glum_ (970-990), a fine story of a heathen hero, brave, crafty\r\nand cruel. To the north also belong the sagas of _Gretti_ the Strong\r\n(1010-1031), the life and death of the most famous of Icelandic outlaws,\r\nthe real story of whose career is mixed up with the mythical adventures\r\nof Beowulf, here put down to Gretti, and with late romantic episodes and\r\nfabulous folk-tales (Dr Vigfusson would ascribe the best parts of this\r\nsaga to Sturla; its last editor, whose additions would be better away,\r\nmust have touched it up about 1300), and the stories of the\r\n_Ljosvetningasaga_ (1009-1060). Gudmund the Mighty and his family and\r\nneighbours are the heroes of these tales, which form a little cycle.\r\nThe _Banda-manna saga_ (1050-1060), the only comedy among the sagas, is\r\nalso a northern tale; it relates the struggles of a plebeian who gets a\r\nchieftancy against the old families of the neighbourhood, whom he\r\nsuccessfully outwits; _Öl-kofra þattr_ is a later imitation of it in the\r\nsame humorous strain. The sagas of the north are rougher and coarser\r\nthan those of the west, but have a good deal of individual character.\r\n\r\nOf tales relating to the east there survive the Weapon-firth cycle--the\r\ntales of _Thorstein the White_ (c. 900), of _Thorstein the Staffsmitten_\r\n(c. 985), of _Gunnar Thidrand's Bane_ (1000-1008) and of the\r\n_Weapon-firth Men_ (975-990), all relating to the family of Hof and\r\ntheir friends and kin for several generations--and the story of\r\n_Hrafnkell Frey's Priest_ (c. 960), the most idyllic of sagas and best\r\nof the eastern tales. Of later times there are _Droplaug's Sons' Saga_\r\n(997-1007), written probably about 1110, and preserved in the uncouth\r\nstyle of the original (a brother's revenge for his brother's death is\r\nthe substance of it; _Brandkrossa Þattr_ is an appendix to it), and the\r\ntales of _Thorstein Hall of Side's Son_ (c. 1014) and his brother\r\n_Thidrandi_ (c. 996), which belong to the cycle of _Hall o' Side's\r\nSaga_, unhappily lost; they are weird tales of bloodshed and magic, with\r\nidyllic and pathetic episodes.\r\n\r\nThe sagas of the south are either lost or absorbed in that of _Nial_\r\n(970-1014), a long and complex story into which are woven the tales of\r\n_Gunnar Nial_, and parts of others, as _Brian Boroimhe_, _Hall o' Side_,\r\n&c. It is, whether we look at style, contents or legal and historical\r\nweight, the foremost of all sagas. It deals especially with law, and\r\ncontains the pith and the moral of all early Icelandic history. Its hero\r\nNial, type of the good lawyer, is contrasted with its villain Mord, the\r\nensample of cunning, chicane, and legal wrong doing; and a great part of\r\nthe saga is taken up with the three cases and suits of the divorce, the\r\ndeath of Hoskuld and the burning of Nial, which are given with great\r\nminuteness. The number and variety of its dramatis personae give it the\r\nliveliest interest throughout. The women Hallgerda, Bergthora and\r\nRagnhild are as sharply contrasted as the men Gunnar, Skarphedin, Flosi\r\nand Kari. The pathos of such tragedies as the death of Gunnar and\r\nHoskuld and the burning is interrupted by the humour of the Althing\r\nscenes and the intellectual interest of the legal proceedings. The plot\r\ndealing first with the life and death of Gunnar, type of the chivalry of\r\nhis day, then with the burning of Nial by Flosi, and how it came about,\r\nand lastly with Kari's revenge on the burners, is the ideal saga-plot.\r\nThe author must have been of the east, a good lawyer and genealogist,\r\nand have composed it about 1250, to judge from internal evidence. It has\r\nbeen overworked by a later editor, c. 1300, who inserted many spurious\r\nverses.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Of Greenland and North America.\r\n\r\nRelating partly to Iceland, but mostly to Greenland and Vinland (N.\r\nAmerica), are the _Floamannasaga_ (985-990), a good story of the\r\nadventures of Thorgils and of the struggles of shipwrecked colonists in\r\nGreenland, a graphic and terrible picture; and _Eirikssaga rauða_\r\n(990-1000), two versions, one northern (Flatey-book), one western, the\r\nbetter (in _Hawk's Book_, and AM. 557), the story of the discovery of\r\nGreenland and Vinland (America) by the Icelanders at the end of the 9th\r\ncentury. Later is the _Fostbrædrasaga_ (1015-1030), a very interesting\r\nstory, told in a quaint romantic style, of Thorgeir, the reckless\r\nhenchman of King Olaf, and how his death was revenged in Greenland by\r\nhis sworn brother the true-hearted Thormod Coalbrow's poet, who\r\nafterward dies at Sticklestad. The tale of _Einar Sookisson_ (c. 1125)\r\nmay also be noticed. The lost saga of _Poet Helgi_, of which only\r\nfragments remain, was also laid in Greenland.\r\n\r\nBesides complete sagas there are embedded in the _Heimskringla_ numerous\r\nsmall _Þættir_ or episodes, small tales of Icelanders' adventures, often\r\nrelating to poets and their lives at the kings' courts; one or two of\r\nthese seem to be fragments of sagas now lost. Among the more notable are\r\nthose of _Orm Storolfsson_, _Ogmund Dijtt_, _Halldor Snorrason_,\r\n_Thorstein Oxfoot_, _Hromund Halt_, _Thorwald Tasaldi_, _Svadi_ and\r\n_Arnor Herlingar-nef_, _Audunn of Westfirth_, _Sneglu-Halli_, _Hrafn of\r\nHrutfiord_, _Hreidar Heimski_, _Gisli Illugison_, _Ivar_ the poet,\r\n_Gull-Æsu Thord_, _Einar Skulason_ the poet, _Mani_ the poet, &c.\r\n\r\nThe forged Icelandic sagas appear as early as the 13th century. They are\r\nvery poor, and either worked up on hints given in genuine stories or\r\naltogether apocryphal.\r\n\r\n_History._--About the year of the battle of Hastings was born Ari Froði\r\nThorgilsson (1067-1148), one of the blood of Queen Aud, who founded the\r\nfamous historical school of Iceland, and himself produced its greatest\r\nmonument in a work which can be compared for value with the English\r\nDomesday Book. Nearly all that we know of the heathen commonwealth may\r\nbe traced to the collections of Ari. It was he too that fixed the style\r\nin which history should be composed in Iceland. It was he that secured\r\nand put into order the vast mass of fragmentary tradition that was\r\nalready dying out in his day. And perhaps it is the highest praise of\r\nall to him that he wrote in his own \"Danish tongue,\" and so ensured the\r\nuse of that tongue by the cultured of after generations. Ari's great\r\nworks are _Konungabók_, or _The Book of Kings_, relating the history of\r\nthe kings of Norway from the rise of the Yngling dynasty down to the\r\ndeath of Harald Sigurdsson in the year of his own birth. This book he\r\ncomposed from the dictation of old men such as Odd Kolsson, from the\r\ngenealogical poems, and from the various dirges, battle-songs and\r\neulogia of the poets. It is most probable that he also compiled shorter\r\n_Kings' Books_ relating to Denmark and perhaps to England. The\r\n_Konungabók_ is preserved under the _Heimskringla_ of Snorri Sturloson,\r\nparts of it almost as they came from Ari's hands, for example _Ynglinga_\r\nand _Harald Fairhair's Saga_, and the prefaces stating the plan and\r\ncritical foundations of the work, parts of it only used as a framework\r\nfor the magnificent superstructure of the lives of the two Olafs, and of\r\nHarald Hardrada and his nephew Magnus the Good. The best text of Ari's\r\n_Konungabók_ (_Ynglinga_, and the sagas down to but not including Olaf\r\nTryggvason's) is that of _Frisbók_.\r\n\r\nThe _Book of Settlements_ (_Landnamabók_) is a wonderful performance,\r\nboth in its scheme and carrying out. It is divided into five parts, the\r\nfirst of which contains a brief account of the discovery of the island;\r\nthe other four, one by one taking a quarter of the land, describe the\r\nname, pedigree and history of each settler in geographical order, notice\r\nthe most important facts in the history of his descendants, the names of\r\ntheir homesteads, their courts and temples, thus including mention of\r\n4000 persons, one-third of whom are women, and 2000 places. The mass of\r\ninformation contained in so small a space, the clearness and accuracy of\r\nthe details, the immense amount of life which is breathed into the\r\nwhole, astonish the reader, when he reflects that this colossal task was\r\naccomplished by one man, for his collaborator Kolsegg merely filled up\r\nhis plan with regard to part of the east coast, a district with which\r\nAri in his western home at Stad was little familiar. _Landnamabók_ has\r\nreached us in two complete editions, one edited by Sturla, who brought\r\ndown the genealogies to his own grandfather and grandmother, Sturla and\r\nGudny, and one by Hawk, who traces the pedigrees still later to himself.\r\n\r\nAri also wrote a _Book of Icelanders_ (_Islendingabók_, c. 1127), which\r\nhas perished as a whole, but fragments of it are embedded in many sagas\r\nand _Kings' Lives_; it seems to have been a complete epitome of his\r\nearlier works, together with an account of the constitutional history,\r\necclesiastical and civil, of Iceland. An abridgment of the latter part\r\nof it, the little _Libellus Islandorum_ (to which the title of the\r\nbigger _Liber--Islendingabók_--is often given), was made by the\r\nhistorian for his friends Bishops Ketil and Thorlak, for whom he wrote\r\nthe _Liber_ (c. 1137). This charming little book is, with the much later\r\ncollections of laws, our sole authority for the Icelandic constitution\r\nof the commonwealth, but, \"much as it tells, the lost _Liber_ would have\r\nbeen of still greater importance.\" _Kristni-Saga_, the story of the\r\nchristening of Iceland, is also a work of Ari's, \"overlaid\" by a later\r\neditor, but often preserving Ari's very words. This saga, together with\r\nseveral scattered tales of early Christians in Iceland before the change\r\nof faith (1002), may have made up a section of the lost _Liber_. Of the\r\nauthor of these works little is known. He lived in quiet days a quiet\r\nlife; but he shows himself in his works, as Snorri describes him, \"a man\r\nwise, of good memory and a speaker of the truth.\" If Thucydides is\r\njustly accounted the first political historian, Ari may be fitly styled\r\nthe first of scientific historians.\r\n\r\nA famous contemporary and friend of Ari is Sæmund (1056-1131), a great\r\nchurchman, whose learning so impressed his age that he got the\r\nreputation of a magician. He was the friend of Bishop John, the founder\r\nof the great Odd-Verjar family, and the author of a _Book of Kings_ from\r\nHarald Fairhair to Magnus the Good, in which he seems to have fixed the\r\nexact chronology of each reign. It is most probable that he wrote in\r\nLatin. The idea that he had anything to do with the poetic _Edda_ in\r\ngeneral, or the _Sun's Song_ in particular, is unfounded.\r\n\r\nThe flame which Ari had kindled was fed by his successors in the 12th\r\ncentury. Eirik Oddsson (c. 1150) wrote the lives of Sigurd Evil-deacon\r\nand the sons of Harold Gille, in his _Hryggiar-Stykki_ (Sheldrake), of\r\nwhich parts remain in the MSS. collections of _Kings' Lives_,\r\n_Morkin-skinna_, &c. Karl Jonsson, abbot of Thingore, the Benedictine\r\nminister, wrote (c. 1184) _Sverrissaga_ from the lips of that great\r\nking, a fine racy biography, with a style and spirit of its own.\r\n_Böglunga-Sögur_ tell the story of the civil wars which followed\r\nSverri's death. They are probably by a contemporary.\r\n\r\nThe Latin _Lives of St Olaf_, Odd's in Latin (c. 1175), compiled from\r\noriginal authorities, and the _Legendary Life_, by another monk whose\r\nname is lost, are of the medieval Latin school of Sæmund to which\r\nGunnlaug belonged.\r\n\r\nSnorri Sturlason (q.v.) was known to his contemporaries as a statesman\r\nand poet; to us he is above all an historian. Snorri (1179-1241) wrote\r\nthe _Lives of the Kings_ (_Heimskringla_), from Olaf Tryggvason to\r\nSigurd the Crusader inclusive; and we have them substantially as they\r\ncame from his hand in the _Great King Olaf's Saga_; _St Olaf's Saga_, as\r\nin _Heimskringla_ and the Stockholm MS.; and the succeeding _Kings'\r\nLives_, as in Hulda and Hrokkinskinna, in which, however, a few episodes\r\nhave been inserted.\r\n\r\nThese works were indebted for their facts to Ari's labours, and to sagas\r\nwritten since Ari's death; but the style and treatment of them are\r\nSnorri's own. The fine Thucydidean speeches, the dramatic power of\r\ngrasping character, and the pathos and poetry that run through the\r\nstories, along with a humour such as is shown in the _Edda_, and a\r\nvaried grace of style that never flags or palls, make Snorri one of the\r\ngreatest of historians.\r\n\r\nHere it should be noticed that _Heimskringla_ and its class of MSS.\r\n(_Eirspennil_, _Jofraskinna_, _Gullinskinna_, _Fris-bok_ and _Kringla_)\r\ndo not give the full text of Snorri's works. They are abridgments made\r\nin Norway by Icelanders for their Norwegian patrons, the _Life of St\r\nOlaf_ alone being preserved intact, for the great interest of the\r\nNorwegians lay in him, but all the other _Kings' Lives_ being more or\r\nless mutilated, so that they cannot be trusted for historic purposes;\r\nnor do they give a fair idea of Snorri's style.\r\n\r\n_Agrip_ is a 12th-century compendium of the _Kings' Lives_ from Harald\r\nFairhair to Sverri, by a scholastic writer of the school of Sæmund. As\r\nthe only Icelandic abridgment of Norwegian history taken not from Snorri\r\nbut sources now lost, it is of worth. Its real title is _Konunga-tal_.\r\n\r\n_Noregs Konunga-tal_, now called _Fagrskinna_, is a Norse compendium of\r\nthe _Kings' Lives_ from Halfdan the Black to Sverri's accession,\r\nprobably written for King Haakon, to whom it was read on his death-bed.\r\nIt is an original work, and contains much not found elsewhere. As\r\nnon-Icelandic it is only noticed here for completeness.\r\n\r\nStyrmi Karason, a contemporary of Snorri's, dying in 1245, was a\r\ndistinguished churchman (lawman twice) and scholar. He wrote a _Life of\r\nSt Olaf_, now lost; his authority is cited. He also copied out\r\n_Landnamabók_ and _Sverri's Life_ from his MSS., of which surviving\r\ncopies were taken.\r\n\r\nSturla, Snorri's nephew, wrote the _Hakonssaga_ and _Magnussaga_ at the\r\nrequest of King Magnus, finishing the first c. 1265, the latter c.\r\n1280. King Haakon's Life is preserved in full; of the other only\r\nfragments remain. These are the last of the series of historic works\r\nwhich Ari's labours began, from which the history of Norway for 500\r\nyears must be gathered.\r\n\r\nA few books relating the history of other Scandinavian realms will\r\ncomplete this survey. In _Skioldunga-bok_ was told the history of the\r\nearly kings of Denmark, perhaps derived from Ari's collections, and\r\nrunning parallel to _Ynglinga_. The earlier part of it has perished save\r\na fragment _Sogu-brot_, and citations and paraphrases in Saxo, and the\r\nmythical _Ragnar Lodbrok's_ and _Gongu-Hrolf's Sagas_; the latter part,\r\n_Lives of Harold Bluetooth and the Kings down to Sveyn II._, is still in\r\nexistence and known as _Skioldunga_.\r\n\r\nThe _Knutssaga_ is of later origin and separate authorships, parallel to\r\nSnorri's _Heimskringla_, but earlier in date. The _Lives of King\r\nValdemar and his Son_, written c. 1185, by a contemporary of Abbot\r\nKarl's, are the last of this series. The whole were edited and compiled\r\ninto one book, often quoted as _Skioldunga_, by a 13th-century editor,\r\npossibly Olaf, the White Poet, Sturla's brother, guest and friend of\r\nKing Valdemar II. _Jomsvikinga Saga_, the history of the pirates of Jom,\r\ndown to Knut the Great's days, also relates to Danish history.\r\n\r\nThe complex work now known as _Orkneyinga_ is made up of the _Earls'\r\nSaga_, lives of the first great earls, Turf-Einar, Thorfinn, &c.; the\r\n_Life of St Magnus_, founded partly on Abbot Robert's Latin life of him\r\n(c. 1150) an Orkney work, partly on Norse or Icelandic biographies; a\r\n_Mirade-book_ of the same saint; the _Lives of Earl Rognwald and Sveyn_,\r\nthe last of the vikings, and a few episodes such as the _Burning of\r\nBishop Adam_. A scholastic sketch of the rise of the Scandinavian\r\nempire, the _Foundation of Norway_, dating c. 1120, is prefixed to the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n_Færeyinga_ tells the tale of the conversion of the Færeys or Faroes,\r\nand the lives of its chiefs Sigmund and Leif, composed in the 13th\r\ncentury from their separate sagas by an Icelander of the Sturlung\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n_Biographies._--The saga has already been shown in two forms, its\r\noriginal epic shape and its later development applied to the lives of\r\nNorwegian and Danish kings and earls, as heroic but deeper and broader\r\nsubjects than before. In the 13th century it is put to a third use, to\r\ntell the plain story of men's lives for their contemporaries, after\r\nsatisfying which demand it dies away for ever.\r\n\r\nThese biographies are more literary and medieval and less poetic than\r\nthe Icelandic sagas and king's lives; their simplicity, truth, realism\r\nand purity of style are the same. They run in two parallel streams, some\r\nbeing concerned with chiefs and champions, some with bishops. The former\r\nare mostly found embedded in the complex mass of stories known as\r\n_Sturlunga_, from which Dr Vigfusson has extricated them, and for the\r\nfirst time set them in order. Among them are the sagas of _Thorgils and\r\nHaflidi_ (1118-1121), the feud and peacemaking of two great chiefs,\r\ncontemporaries of Ari; of _Sturla_ (1150-1183), the founder of the great\r\nSturlung family, down to the settlement of his great lawsuit by Jon\r\nLoptsson, who thereupon took his son Snorri the historian to\r\nfosterage,--a humorous story but with traces of the decadence about it,\r\nand glimpses of the evil days that were to come; of the\r\n_Önundar-brennusaga_ (1185-1200), a tale of feud and fire-raising in the\r\nnorth of the island, the hero of which, Gudmund Dyri, goes at last into\r\na cloister; of _Hrafn Sveinbiornsson_ (1190-1213), the noblest Icelander\r\nof his day, warrior, leech, seaman, craftsman, poet and chief, whose\r\nlife at home, travels and pilgrimages abroad (Hrafn was one of the first\r\nto visit Becket's shrine), and death at the hands of a foe whom he had\r\ntwice spared, are recounted by a loving friend in pious memory of his\r\nvirtues, c. 1220; of _Áron Hiorleifsson_ (1200-1255), a man whose\r\nstrength, courage and adventures befit rather a henchman of Olaf\r\nTryggvason than one of King Haakon's thanes (the beginning of the feuds\r\nthat rise round Bishop Gudmund are told here), of the _Svinefell-men_\r\n(1248-1252), a pitiful story of a family feud in the far east of\r\nIceland.\r\n\r\nBut the most important works of this class are the _Islendinga Saga_ and\r\n_Thorgils Saga_ of Lawman Sturla. Sturla and his brother Olaf were the\r\nsons of Thord Sturlason and his mistress Thora. Sturla was born and\r\nbrought up in prosperous times, but his manhood was passed in the midst\r\nof strife, in which his family fell one by one, and he himself, though a\r\npeaceful man who cared little for politics, was more than once forced to\r\nfly for his life. While in refuge with King Magnus, in Norway, he wrote\r\nhis two sagas of that king and his father. After his first stay in\r\nNorway he came back in 1271, with the new Norse law-book, and served a\r\nsecond time as lawman. The _Islendinga_ must have been the work of his\r\nlater years, composed at Fairey in Broadfirth, where he died, 30th July\r\n1284, aged about seventy years. The saga of _Thorgils Skardi_\r\n(1252-1261) seems to have been the first of his works on Icelandic\r\ncontemporary history; it deals with the life of his own nephew,\r\nespecially his career in Iceland from 1252 to 1258. The second part of\r\n_Islendinga_ (1242-1262), which relates to the second part of the civil\r\nwar, telling of the careers of Thord Kakali, Kolbein the Young, Earl\r\nGizur and Hrafn Oddsson. The end is imperfect, there being a blank of\r\nsome years before the fragmentary ending to which an editor has affixed\r\na notice of the author's death. The first part of _Islendinga_\r\n(1202-1242) tells of the beginning and first part of the civil wars, the\r\nlives of Snorri and Sighvat, Sturla's uncles, of his cousin and namesake\r\nSturla Sighvatsson, of Bishop Gudmund, and Thorwald Gizursson,--the fall\r\nof the Sturlungs, and with them the last hopes of the great houses to\r\nmaintain the commonwealth, being the climax of the story.\r\n\r\nSturla's power lies in his faithfulness to nature, minute observance of\r\ndetail and purity of style. The great extent of his subject, and the\r\ndifficulty of dealing with it in the saga form, are most skilfully\r\novercome; nor does he allow prejudice or favour to stand in the way of\r\nthe truth. He ranks below Ari in value and below Snorri in power; but no\r\none else can dispute his place in the first rank of Icelandic writers.\r\n\r\nOf the ecclesiastical biographers, an anonymous Skalholt clerk is the\r\nbest. He wrote _Hungrvaka_, lives of the first five bishops of Skalholt,\r\nand biographies of his patron Bishop Paul (_Pálssaga_) and also of St\r\nThorlak (_Thorlakssaga_). They are full of interesting notices of social\r\nand church life. Thorlak was a learned man, and had studied at Paris and\r\nLincoln, which he left in 1161. These lives cover the years 1056-1193.\r\nThe life of St John, a great reformer, a contemporary of Thorodd, whom\r\nhe employed to build a church for him, is by another author (1052-1121).\r\nThe life of Gudmund (_Gudmundar Saga Goda_), as priest, recounts the\r\nearly life of this Icelandic Becket till his election as bishop\r\n(1160-1202); his after career must be sought out in _Islendinga_. It is\r\nwritten by a friend and contemporary. A later life by Arngrim, abbot of\r\nThingore, written c. 1350, as evidence of his subject's sanctity, tells\r\na good deal about Icelandic life, &c. The lives of Bishops Arni and\r\nLawrence bring down our knowledge of Icelandic history into the 14th\r\ncentury. The former work, _Arna Saga Biskups_, is imperfect; it is the\r\nrecord of the struggles of church and state over patronage rights and\r\nglebes, written c. 1315; it now covers only the years 1269-1291; a great\r\nmany documents are given in it, after the modern fashion. The latter,\r\n_Laurentius Saga Biskups_, by his disciple, priest Einar Haflidason, is\r\na charming biography of a good and pious man, whose chequered career in\r\nNorway and Iceland is picturesquely told (1324-1331). It is the last of\r\nthe sagas. _Bishop Jon's Table-Talk_ (1325-1339) is also worth noticing;\r\nit contains many popular stories which the good bishop, who had studied\r\nat Bologna and Paris, was wont to tell to his friends.\r\n\r\n_Annals._--The _Annals_ are now almost the sole material for Icelandic\r\nhistory; they had begun earlier, but after 1331 they got fuller and\r\nricher, till they end in 1430. The best are _Annales Regii_, ending\r\n1306, _Einar Haflidason's Annals_, known as \"Lawman's Annals,\" reaching\r\nto 1392, and preserved with others in _Flatey-book_, and the _New\r\nAnnals_, last of all. The _Diplomatarium Islandicum_, edited by Jon\r\nSigurdsson, contains what remains of deeds, inventories, letters, &c.,\r\nfrom the old days, completing our scanty material for this dark period\r\nof the island's history.\r\n\r\n_Literature of Foreign Origin._--After the union with Norway and change\r\nof law genuine tradition died out with the great houses. The ordinary\r\nmedieval literature reached Iceland through Norway, and every one began\r\nto put it into a vernacular dress, so neglecting their own classics that\r\nbut for a few collectors like Lawman Hauk they would have perished\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian kings, Haakon Haakonson (c. 1225), and Haakon V. (c.\r\n1305), employed Icelanders at their courts in translating the French\r\nromances of the Alexander, Arthur and Charlemagne cycles. Some forty or\r\nfifty of these _Riddara-Sögur_ (Romances of Chivalry) remain. They\r\nreached Iceland and were eagerly read, many Rimur being founded on them.\r\nNorse versions of _Mary of Brittany's Lays_, the stories of _Brutus_ and\r\nof _Troy_, and part of the _Pharsalia_ translated are also found. The\r\n_Speculum Regale_, with its interesting geographical and social\r\ninformation, is also Norse, written c. 1240, by a Halogalander. The\r\ncomputistic and arithmetical treatises of Stiorn-Odd, Biarni the\r\nNumber-skilled (d. 1173), and Hauk Erlendsson the Lawman (d. 1334), and\r\nthe geography of Ivar Bardsson, a Norwegian (c. 1340), are of course of\r\nforeign origin. A few tracts on geography, &c., in Hauk's book, and a\r\n_Guide to the Holy Land_, by Nicholas, abbot of Thwera (d. 1158),\r\ncomplete the list of scientific works.\r\n\r\nThe stories which contain the last lees of the old mythology and\r\npre-history seem to be also non-Icelandic, but amplified by Icelandic\r\neditors, who probably got the plots from the Western Islands. _Völsunga\r\nSaga_ and _Hervarar Saga_ contain quotations and paraphrases of lays by\r\nthe Helgi poet, and _Half's_, _Ragnar's_ and _Asmund Kappabana's Sagas_\r\nall have bits of Western poetry in them. _Hrolf Kraki's Saga_\r\nparaphrases part of _Biarkamal_; _Hromund Gripsson's_ gives the story of\r\nHelgi and Kara (the lost third of the Helgi trilogy); _Gautrek's Arrow\r\nOdd's_, _Frithiof's Sagas_, &c., contain shreds of true tradition amidst\r\na mass of later fictitious matter of no worth. With the _Riddara-Sögur_\r\nthey enjoyed great popularity in the 15th century, and gave matter for\r\nmany Rimur. _Thidrek's Saga_, a late version of the Völsung story, is of\r\nNorse composition (c. 1230), from North German sources.\r\n\r\nThe medieval religious literature of Western Europe also influenced\r\nIceland, and the _Homilies_ (like the _Laws_) were, according to\r\nThorodd, the earliest books written in the vernacular, antedating even\r\nAri's histories. The lives of the _Virgin_, the _Apostles_ and the\r\n_Saints_ fill many MSS. (edited in four large volumes by Professor\r\nUnger), and are the works of many authors, chiefly of the 13th and 14th\r\ncenturies; amongst them are the lives of _SS. Edward the Confessor_,\r\n_Oswald of Northumbria_, _Dunstan_ and _Thomas of Canterbury_. Of the\r\nauthors we know Priest Berg Gunsteinsson (d. 1211); Kygri-Biorn,\r\nbishop-elect (d. 1237); Bishop Brand (d. 1264); Abbot Runolf (d. 1307);\r\nBishop Lawrence's son Arni (c. 1330); Abbot Berg (c. 1340), &c. A\r\nparaphrase of the historical books of the Bible was made by Bishop Brand\r\n(d. 1264), called _Gydinga Sögur_. About 1310 King Haakon V. ordered a\r\ncommentary on the Bible to be made, which was completed down to Exodus\r\nxix. To this Brand's work was afterwards affixed, and the whole is known\r\nas _Stiorn_. The Norse version of the famous _Barlaam and Josaphat_,\r\nmade for Prince Haakon (c. 1240), must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n_Post-classical Literature._--The post-classical literature falls\r\nchiefly under three heads--religious, literary and scientific. Under the\r\nfirst comes foremost the noble translation of the New Testament by Odd\r\nGottskalksson, son of the bishop of Hólar. Brought up in Norway, he\r\ntravelled in Denmark and Germany, and took upon him the new faith before\r\nhe returned to Iceland, where he became secretary to Bishop Ogmund of\r\nSkalholt. Here he began by translating the Gospel of Matthew into his\r\nmother-tongue in secret. Having finished the remainder of the New\r\nTestament at his own house at Olves, he took it to Denmark, where it was\r\nprinted at Roskild in 1540. Odd afterwards translated the Psalms, and\r\nseveral devotional works of the day, Corvinus's _Epistles_, &c. He was\r\nmade lawman of the north and west, and died from a fall in the Laxa in\r\nKios, June 1556. Three years after his death the first press was set up\r\nin Iceland by John Matthewson, at Breidabolstad, in Hunafloe, and a\r\n_Gospel and Epistle Book_, according to Odd's version, issued from it\r\nin 1562. In 1584 Bishop Gudbrand, who had brought over a splendid fount\r\nof type from Denmark in 1575 (which he completed with his own hands),\r\nprinted a translation of the whole Bible at Hólar, incorporating Odd's\r\nversions and some books (Proverbs and the Son of Sirach, 1580)\r\ntranslated by Bishop Gizar, but supplying most of the Old Testament\r\nhimself. This fine volume was the basis of every Bible issued for\r\nIceland till 1826, when it was replaced by a bad modern version. For\r\nbeauty of language and faithful simplicity of style the finer parts of\r\nthis version, especially the New Testament, have never been surpassed.\r\n\r\nThe most notable theological work Iceland ever produced is the\r\n_Postill-Book_ of Bishop John Vidalin (1666-1720), whose bold homely\r\nstyle and stirring eloquence made \"John's Book,\" as it is lovingly\r\ncalled, a favourite in every household, till in the 19th century it was\r\nreplaced for the worse by the more sentimental and polished Danish\r\ntracts and sermons. Theological literature is very popular, and many\r\nworks on this subject, chiefly translations, will be found in the lists\r\nof Icelandic bibliographers.\r\n\r\nThe first modern scientific work is the _Iter per patriam_ of Eggert\r\nOlafsson and Biarni Paulsson, which gives an account of the physical\r\npeculiarities--fauna, flora, &c.--of the island as far as could be done\r\nat the date of its appearance, 1772. The island was first made known to\r\n\"the world\" by this book and by the sketch of Unno von Troil, a Swede,\r\nwho accompanied Sir Joseph Banks to Iceland in 1772, and afterwards\r\nwrote a series of \"letters\" on the land and its literature, &c. This\r\ntour was the forerunner of an endless series of \"travels,\" of which\r\nthose of Sir W. J. Hooker, Sir G. S. Mackenzie (1810), Ebenezer\r\nHenderson (1818), Joseph Paul Gaimard (1838-1843), Paijkull (1867) and,\r\nlastly, that of Sir Richard Burton, an excellent account of the land and\r\npeople, crammed with information of every kind (1875), are the best.\r\n\r\nIceland is emphatically a land of proverbs, while of folk-tales, those\r\nother keys to the people's heart, there is plentiful store. Early work\r\nin this direction was done by Jon Gudmundsson, Olaf the Old and John\r\nOlafsson in the 17th century, who all put traditions on paper, and their\r\nlabours were completed by the magnificent collection of Jon Arnason\r\n(1862-1864), who was inspired by the example of the Grimms. Many tales\r\nare but weak echoes of the sagas; many were family legends, many are old\r\nfairy tales in a garb suited to their new northern home; but, besides\r\nall these, there are a number of traditions and superstitions of\r\nindigenous origin.\r\n\r\nThe Renaissance of Iceland dates from the beginning of the 17th century,\r\nwhen a school of antiquaries arose. Arngrim Jonsson's _Brevis\r\nCommentarius_ (1593), and _Crymogaea_ (1609), were the first-fruits of\r\nthis movement, of which Bishops Odd, Thorlak and Bryniulf (worthy\r\nparallels to Parker and Laud) were the wise and earnest supporters. The\r\nfirst (d. 1630) collected much material for church history. The second\r\n(d. 1656) saved _Sturlunga_ and the _Bishops' Lives_, encouraged John\r\nEgilsson to write his _New Hungerwaker_, lives of the bishops of the\r\nDark Ages and Reformation, and helped Biorn of Skardsa (d. 1655), a bold\r\nand patriotic antiquary (whose _Annals_ continue Einar's), in his\r\nresearches. The last (d. 1675) collected a fine library of MSS., and\r\nemployed the famous copyist John Erlendsson, to whom and the bishop's\r\nbrother, John Gizurarsson (d. 1648), we are indebted for transcripts of\r\nmany lost MSS.\r\n\r\nTorfaeus (1636-1719) and Bartholin, a Dane (d. 1690), roused the taste\r\nfor northern literature in Europe, a taste which has never since\r\nflagged; and soon after them Arni Magnusson (1663-1730) transferred all\r\nthat remained of vellum and good paper MSS. in Iceland to Denmark, and\r\nlaid the foundations of the famous library and bequest, for which all\r\nIcelandic students are so much beholden. For over forty years Arni stuck\r\nto his task, rescuing every scrap he could lay hands on from the risks\r\nof the Icelandic climate and carelessness, and when he died only one\r\ngood MSS. remained in the island. Besides his magnificent collection,\r\nthere are a few MSS. of great value at Upsala, at Stockholm, and in the\r\nold royal collection at Copenhagen. Those in the university library in\r\nthe latter city perished in the fire of 1728. Sagas were printed at\r\nUpsala and Copenhagen in the 17th century, and the Arna-Magnaean fund\r\nhas been working since 1772. In that year appeared also the first volume\r\nof Bishop Finn Jonsson's _Historia Ecclesiastica Islandiae_, a work of\r\nhigh value and much erudition, containing not only ecclesiastical but\r\ncivil and literary history, illustrated by a well-chosen mass of\r\ndocuments, 870-1740. It has been continued by Bishop P. Peterson to\r\nmodern times, 1740-1840. The results, however, of modern observers and\r\nscholars must be sought for in the periodicals, _Safn_, _Felagsrit_, _Ny\r\nFelagsrit_ and others. John Espolin's _Arbækr_ is very good up to its\r\ndate, 1821.\r\n\r\n  A brilliant sketch of Icelandic classic literature is given by Dr\r\n  Gudbrandr Vigfusson in the Prolegomena to _Sturlunga Saga_ (Oxford,\r\n  1879). It replaces much earlier work, especially the _Sciagraphia_ of\r\n  Halfdan Einarsson (1777), and the _Saga-Bibliotek_ of Müller. The\r\n  numerous editions of the classics by the Icelandic societies, the\r\n  Danish Société des Antiquités, Nordiske Litteratur Samfund, and the\r\n  new Gammel Nordisk Litteratur Samfund, the splendid Norwegian editions\r\n  of Unger, the labours of the Icelanders Sigurdsson and Gislason, and\r\n  of those foreign scholars in Scandinavia and Germany who have thrown\r\n  themselves into the work of illustrating, publishing and editing the\r\n  sagas and poems (men like P. A. Munch, S. Bugge, F. W. Bergmann, Th.\r\n  Möbius and K. von Maurer, to name only a few), can only be referred to\r\n  here.

P.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT LITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe recent literature of Iceland has been in a more flourishing state\r\nthan ever before since the 13th century. Lyrical poetry is by far the\r\nlargest and the most interesting portion of it. The great influence of\r\nJónas Hallgrímsson (1807-1845) is still felt, and his school was the\r\nreigning one up to the end of the 19th century, although then a change\r\nseemed to be in sight. The most successful poet of this school is\r\nSteingrímr Thorsteinsson (b. 1830). He is specially famous for his\r\nsplendid descriptions of scenery (_The Song of Gilsbakki_), his\r\nlove-songs and his sarcastic epigrams. As a translator he has enriched\r\nthe literature with _The Arabian Nights_, _Sakuntala_, _King Lear_ and\r\nseveral other masterpieces of foreign literature. Equal in fame is\r\nMatthías Jochumsson (b. 1835), who, following another of Jónas\r\nHallgrímsson's many ways, has successfully revived the old metres of the\r\nclassical Icelandic poets, whom he resembles in his majestic, but\r\nsometimes too gorgeous, language. He is as an artist inferior to\r\nSteingrímr Thorsteinsson, but surpasses him in bold flight of\r\nimagination. He has successfully treated subjects from Icelandic history\r\n_Grettisljóð_, a series of poems about the famous outlaw Grettir. His\r\nchief fault is a certain carelessness in writing; he can never write a\r\nbad poem, but rarely a poem absolutely flawless. He has translated\r\nTegnér's _Frithiofs Saga_, several plays of Shakespeare and some other\r\nforeign masterpieces. The great religious poet of Iceland, Hallgrímr\r\nPétursson, has found a worthy successor in Valdemar Briem (b. 1848),\r\nwhose _Songs of the Bible_ are deservedly popular. He is like Matthías\r\nJochumsson in the copious flow of his rhetoric; some of his poems are\r\nperfect both as regards form and contents, but he sometimes neglects the\r\nlatter while polishing the former. An interesting position is occupied\r\nby Benedict Gröndal (b. 1826), whose travesties of the old romantic\r\nstories,[7] and his Aristophanic drama _Gandreiðin_ (\"The Magic Ride\")\r\nabout contemporary events, are among the best satirical and humorous\r\nproductions of Icelandic literature.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by Jónas Hallgrímsson with regard to language and poetic\r\ndiction, but keeping unbroken the traditions of Icelandic medieval\r\npoetry maintained by Sigurðr Breiðfjörð (1798-1846), is another school\r\nof poets, very unlike the first. In the middle of the 19th century this\r\nschool was best represented by Hjálmar Jónsson from Bóla (1796-1875), a\r\npoor farmer with little education, but endowed with great poetical\r\ntalents, and the author of satirical verses not inferior to those of\r\nJuvenal both in force and coarseness. In the last decades of the 19th\r\ncentury this school produced two poets of a very high order, both\r\ndistinctly original and Icelandic. One is Páll Olafsson (b. 1827). His\r\nsongs are mostly written in the medieval quatrains (_ferskeytla_), and\r\nare generally of a humorous and satirical character; his convivial songs\r\nare known by heart by every modern Icelander; and although some of the\r\npoets of the present day are more admired, there is none who is more\r\nloved by the people. The other is Þorsteinn Erlingsson (b. 1858). His\r\nexquisite satirical songs, in an easy and elegant but still manly and\r\nsplendid language, have raised much discussion. Of his poems may be\r\nmentioned _The Oath_, a series of most beautiful ballads, with a\r\ntragical love-story of the 17th century as their base, but with many and\r\nhappy satirical allusions to modern life; _Jörundr_, a long poem about\r\nthe convict king, the Danish pirate Jörgensen, who nearly succeeded in\r\nmaking himself the master of Iceland, and _The Fate of the Gods_ and\r\n_The Men of the West_ (the Americans), two poems which, with their\r\nanti-clerical and half-socialistic tendencies, have caused strong\r\nprotests from orthodox Lutheran clergy. Near to this school, but still\r\nstanding apart, is Grímur Thomsen (b. 1820).\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the 'eighties a new school arose--having its origin\r\nin the colony of Icelandic students at the University of Copenhagen.\r\nThey had all attended the lectures of Georg Brandes, the great reformer\r\nof Scandinavian literature, and, influenced by his literary theories,\r\nthey chose their models in the realistic school. This school is very\r\ndissimilar from the half-romantic school of Jónas Hallgrímsson; it is\r\nnearer the national Icelandic school represented by Páll Olafsson and\r\nÞorsteinn Erlingsson, but differs from those writers by introducing\r\nforeign elements hitherto unknown in Icelandic literature,\r\nand--especially in the case of the prose-writers--by imitating closely\r\nthe style and manner of some of the great Norwegian novelists. Their\r\ninfluence brought the Icelandic literature into new roads, and it is\r\ninteresting to see how the tough Icelandic element gradually assimilates\r\nthe foreign. Of the lyrical poets, Hannes Hafsteinn (b. 1861) is by far\r\nthe most important. In his splendid ballad, _The Death of Skarphedinn_,\r\nand in his beautiful series of songs describing a voyage through some of\r\nthe most picturesque parts of Iceland, he is entirely original; but in\r\nhis love-songs, beautiful as many of them are, a strong foreign\r\ninfluence can be observed. Among the innovations of this poet we may\r\nnote a predilection for new metres, sometimes adopted from foreign\r\nlanguages, sometimes invented by himself, a thing practised rarely and\r\ngenerally with small success by the Icelandic poets.\r\n\r\nNo Icelandic novelist has as yet equalled Jón Thóroddsen (1819-1868).\r\nThe influence of the realistic school has of late been predominant. The\r\nmost distinguished writer of that school has been Gestur Pálsson\r\n(1852-1891), whose short stories with their sharp and biting satire have\r\nproduced many imitations in Iceland. The best are _A Home of Love_ and\r\n_Captain Sigurd_. Jónas Jónasson (b. 1856), a clergyman of northern\r\nIceland, has, in a series of novels and short stories, given accurate,\r\nbut somewhat dry, descriptions of the more gloomy sides of Icelandic\r\ncountry life. His best novel is _Randiðr from Hvassafell_, an historical\r\nnovel of the middle ages. Besides these we may mention Torfhildur Hólm,\r\none of the few women who have distinguished themselves in Icelandic\r\nliterature. Her novels are mostly historical. The last decade of the\r\n19th century saw the establishment of a permanent theatre at Reykjavik.\r\nThe poet Matthías Jochumsson has written several dramas, but their chief\r\nmerits are lyrical. The most successful of Icelandic dramatists as yet\r\nis Indrði Einarsson, whose plays, chiefly historical, in spite of\r\nexcessive rhetoric, are very interesting and possess a true dramatic\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nIn geography and geology Þorvaldr Thoroddsen has acquired a European\r\nfame for his researches and travels in Iceland, especially in the\r\nrarely-visited interior. Of his numerous writings in Icelandic, Danish\r\nand German, the _History of Icelandic Geography_ is a monumental\r\nwork. In history Páll Melsteð's (b. 1812) chief work, the large _History\r\nof the World_, belongs to this period, and its pure style has had a\r\nbeneficial influence upon modern Icelandic prose.\r\n\r\nOf the younger historians we may mention Þorkell Bjarnason (_History of\r\nthe Reformation in Iceland_). Jón Þorkelsson (b. 1822), inspector of the\r\narchives of Iceland, has rendered great services to the study of\r\nIcelandic history and literature by his editions of the _Diplomatarium\r\nIslandicum_ and _Obituarium Islandicum_, and by his _Icelandic Poetry in\r\nthe 15th and 16th Century_, written in Danish, an indispensable work for\r\nany student of that period. A leading position among Icelandic\r\nlexicographers is occupied by Jón Þorkelsson, formerly head of the Latin\r\nschool at Reykjavik, whose _Supplement til islandske Ordbøger_, an\r\nIcelandic-Danish vocabulary (three separate collections), has hardly\r\nbeen equalled in learning and accuracy. Other distinguished philologists\r\nare his successor as head of the Latin school, Bjôrn Magnússon Olsen\r\n(_Researches on Sturlunga_, _Ari the Wise_, _The Runes in the Old\r\nIcelandic Literature_--the last two works in Danish); Finnur Jónsson,\r\nprofessor at the University of Copenhagen (_History of the Old Norwegian\r\nand Icelandic Literature_, in Danish, and excellent editions of many old\r\nIcelandic classical works); and Valtýr Guðmundsson, lecturer at the\r\nUniversity of Copenhagen (several works on the old architecture of\r\nScandinavia) and editor of the influential Icelandic literary and\r\npolitical review, _Eimreiðin_ (\"The Locomotive\").\r\n\r\n  See J.

It is often of a pale chestnut colour, but varies\r\nconsiderably, being sometimes almost entirely greyish white; and grows\r\nto a height of from 3 to 4 in., the branches being channelled or rolled\r\ninto tubes, which terminate in flattened lobes with fringed edges. It\r\ngrows abundantly in the mountainous regions of northern countries, and\r\nit is specially characteristic of the lava slopes and plains of the west\r\nand north of Iceland. It is found on the mountains of north Wales, north\r\nEngland, Scotland and south-west Ireland. As met with in commerce it is\r\na light-grey harsh cartilaginous body, almost destitute of colour, and\r\nhaving a slightly bitter taste. It contains about 70% of lichenin or\r\nlichen-starch, a body isomeric with common starch, but wanting any\r\nappearance of structure. It also yields a peculiar modification of\r\nchlorophyll, called thallochlor, fumaric acid, licheno-stearic acid and\r\ncetraric acid, to which last it owes its bitter taste. It forms a\r\nnutritious and easily digested amylaceous food, being used in place of\r\nstarch in some preparations of cocoa. It is not, however, in great\r\nrequest, and even in Iceland it is only habitually resorted to in\r\nseasons of scarcity. Cetraric acid or cetrarin, a white\r\nmicro-crystalline powder with a bitter taste, is readily soluble in\r\nalcohol, and slightly soluble in water and ether. It has been\r\nrecommended for medicinal use, in doses of 2 to 4 grains, as a bitter\r\ntonic and aperient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICE-PLANT, the popular name for _Mesembryanthemum crystallinum_, a hardy\r\nannual most effective for rockwork. It is a low-growing spreading\r\nherbaceous plant with the fleshy stem and leaves covered with large\r\nglittering papillae which give it the appearance of being coated with\r\nice. It is a dry-country plant, a native of Greece and other parts of\r\nthe Mediterranean region, the Canary Islands, South Africa and\r\nCalifornia. _Mesembryanthemum_ is a large genus (containing about 300\r\nspecies) of erect or prostrate fleshy herbs or low shrubs, mostly\r\nnatives of South Africa, and rarely hardy in the British Isles where\r\nthey are mostly grown as greenhouse plants. They bear conspicuous white,\r\nyellow or red flowers with many petals inserted in the calyx-tube. The\r\nthick fleshy leaves are very variable in shape, and often have spiny\r\nrigid hairs on the margin. They are essentially sun-loving plants. The\r\nbest-known member of the genus is _M. cordifolium, var. variegatum_,\r\nwith heart-shaped green and silvery leaves and bright rosy-purple\r\nflowers. It is extensively used for edging flower-beds and borders\r\nduring the summer months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICE-YACHTING, the sport of sailing and racing ice-boats. It is practised\r\nin Great Britain, Norway and Sweden, to some extent, and is very popular\r\nin Holland and on the Gulf of Finland, but its highest development is in\r\nthe United States and Canada. The Dutch ice-yacht is a flat-bottomed\r\nboat resting crossways upon a planking about three feet wide and sixteen\r\nlong, to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern\r\nand each end of the planking. The rudder is a fifth runner fixed to a\r\ntiller. Heavy mainsails and jibs are generally used and the boat is\r\nbuilt more for safety than for speed. The ice-boat of the Gulf of\r\nFinland is a V-shaped frame with a heavy plank running from bow to\r\nstern, in which the mast is stepped. The stern or steering runner is\r\nworked by a tiller or wheel. The sail is a large lug and the boom and\r\ngaff are attached to the mast by travellers. The passengers sit upon\r\nplanks or rope netting. The Russian boats are faster than the Dutch.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 ice-yachting was in vogue on the Hudson river, its headquarters\r\nbeing at Poughkeepsie, New York. The type was a square box on three\r\nrunners, the two forward ones being nailed to the box and the third\r\nacting as a rudder operated by a tiller. The sail was a flatheaded\r\nsprit. This primitive style generally obtained until 1853, when\r\ntriangular frames with \"boxes\" for the crew aft and jib and mainsail rig\r\nwere introduced. A heavy, hard-riding type soon developed, with short\r\ngaffs, low sails, large jibs and booms extending far over the stern. It\r\nwas over-canvassed and the mast was stepped directly over the\r\nrunner-plank, bringing the centre of sail-balance so far aft that the\r\nboats were apt to run away, and the over-canvassing frequently caused\r\nthe windward runner to swing up into the air to a dangerous height. The\r\nlargest and fastest example of this type, which prevailed until 1879,\r\nwas Commodore J. A. Roosevelt's first \"Icicle,\" which measured 69 ft.\r\nover all and carried 1070 sq. ft. of canvas. In 1879 Mr H. Relyea built\r\nthe \"Robert Scott,\" which had a single backbone and wire guy-ropes, and\r\nit became the model for all Hudson river ice-yachts. Masts were now\r\nstepped farther forward, jibs were shortened, booms cut down, and the\r\ncentre of sail-balance was brought more inboard and higher up, causing\r\nthe centres of effort and resistance to come more in harmony. The\r\nshallow steering-box became elliptical. In 1881 occurred the first race\r\nfor the American Challenge Pennant, which represents the championship of\r\nthe Hudson river, the clubs competing including the Hudson river, North\r\nShrewsbury, Orange lake, Newburgh and Carthage Ice-Yacht Clubs. The\r\nraces are usually sailed five times round a triangle of which each leg\r\nmeasures one mile, at least two of the legs being to windward.\r\nIce-yachts are divided into four classes, carrying respectively 600 sq.\r\nft. of canvas or more, between 450 and 600, between 300 and 450, and\r\nless than 300 sq. ft. Ice-yachting is very popular on the Great Lakes,\r\nboth in the United States and Canada, the Kingston (Ontario) Club having\r\na fleet of over 25 sail. Other important centres of the sport are Lakes\r\nMinnetonka and White Bear in Minnesota, Lakes Winnebago and Pepin in\r\nWisconsin, Bar Harbor lake in Maine, the St Lawrence river, Quinte Bay\r\nand Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\nA modern ice-yacht is made of a single-piece backbone the entire length\r\nof the boat, and a runner-plank upon which it rests at right angles, the\r\ntwo forming a kite-shaped frame. The best woods for these pieces are\r\nbasswood, butternut and pine. They are cut from the log in such a way\r\nthat the heart of the timber expands, giving the planks a permanent\r\ncurve, which, in the finished boat, is turned upward. The two forward\r\nrunners, usually made of soft cast iron and about 2 ft. 7 in. long and\r\n2½ in. high, are set into oak frames a little over 5 ft. long and 5 in.\r\nhigh. The runners have a cutting edge of 90%, though a V-shaped edge is\r\noften preferred for racing. The rudder is a runner about 3 ft. 7 in.\r\nlong, worked by a tiller, sometimes made very long, 7½ ft. not being\r\nuncommon. This enables the helmsman to lie in the box at full length and\r\nsteer with his feet, leaving his hands free to tend the sheet. Masts and\r\nspars are generally made hollow for racing-yachts and the rigging is\r\npliable steel wire. The sails are of 10-oz. duck for a boat carrying 400\r\nsq. ft. of canvas. They have very high peaks, short hoists and long\r\nbooms. The mainsail and jib rig is general, but a double-masted lateen\r\nrig has been found advantageous. The foremost ice-yacht builder of\r\nAmerica is G. E. Buckhout of Poughkeepsie.\r\n\r\nAn ice-yacht about 40 ft. in length will carry 6 or 7 passengers or\r\ncrew, who are distributed in such a manner as to preserve the balance of\r\nthe boat. In a good breeze the crew lie out on the windward side of the\r\nrunner-plank to balance the boat and reduce the pressure on the leeward\r\nrunner. A course of 20 m. with many turns has been sailed on the Hudson\r\nin less than 48 minutes, the record for a measured mile with flying\r\nstart being at the rate of about 72 m. an hour. In a high wind, however,\r\nice-yachts often move at the rate of 85 and even 90 m. an hour.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the laws of ice navigation seem marvellous to the\r\nuninitiated. Commodore Irving Grinnell, who has made a scientific study\r\nof the sport, says: \"The two marked peculiarities of ice-yachting which\r\ncause it to differ materially from yachting on the sea are: (1) Sailing\r\nfaster than the wind. (2) Sheets flat aft under all circumstances.\" Mr\r\nH. A. Buck, in the \"Badminton Library,\" _Skating, Curling, Tobogganing_,\r\n&c., thus explains these paradoxes. An ice-boat sails faster than the\r\nwind because she invariably sails at some angle to it. The momentum is\r\nincreased by every puff of wind striking the sails obliquely, until it\r\nis finally equalled by the increase of friction engendered. Thus the\r\ncontinued bursts of wind against the sails cause a greater accumulation\r\nof speed in the ice-yacht than is possessed by the wind itself. When the\r\nboat sails directly before the wind she is, like a balloon, at its\r\nmercy, and thus does not sail faster than the wind. The ice-yacht always\r\nsails with its sheets flat aft, because the greater speed of the boat\r\nchanges the angle at which the wind strikes the sail from that at which\r\nit would strike if the yacht were stationary to such a degree that, in\r\nwhatever direction the yacht is sailing, the result is always the same\r\nas if the yacht were close-hauled to the wind. It follows that the yacht\r\nis actually overhauling the wind, and her canvas shivers as if in the\r\nwind's eye. When eased off her momentum becomes less and less until it\r\ndrops to the velocity of the wind, when she can readily be stopped by\r\nbeing spun round and brought head to the wind. The latter method is one\r\nway of \"coming to,\" instead of luffing up in the usual way from a beam\r\nwind. In beating to windward an ice-boat is handled like a water yacht,\r\nthough she points more closely.\r\n\r\nOn the bays near New York a peculiar kind of ice-boat has developed,\r\ncalled _scooter_, which may be described as a toboggan with a sail. A\r\ntypical scooter is about 15 ft. long with an extreme beam of 5 ft.,\r\nperfectly oval in form and flat. It has mainsail and jib carried on a\r\nmast 9 or 10 ft. long and set well aft, and is provided with two long\r\nparallel metal runners. There is no rudder, the scooter being steered\r\nentirely by trimming the sails, particularly the jib. As the craft is\r\nflat and buoyant it sails well in water, and can thus be used on very\r\nthin ice without danger. A speed of 50 m. an hour has been attained by a\r\nscooter (see _Outing_ for March 1905).\r\n\r\n  See _Ice Sports_, in the \"Isthmian Library\"; _Skating, Curling,\r\n  Tobogganing, &c._ in the \"Badminton Library.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI-CH'ANG (YI-CH'ANG, anciently known as _Yi-ling_), a town of China in\r\nthe province of Hu-peh, one of the four ports opened to foreign trade by\r\ntreaty in 1877. It is situated in 30° 42´ N. and (approximately) 111°\r\n20´ E., on the Yangtsze-Kiang, 1000 m. from Shanghai. Built on the left\r\nbank of the river where it escapes from the ravines and gorges which for\r\n350 m. have imprisoned its channel, I-ch'ang is exposed to considerable\r\nrisk of floods; in 1870 the waters rose 20 ft. in one day, and the town\r\nhad many of its houses and about half of its wall swept away. The first\r\nEnglish vessels to ascend the river as far as I-ch'ang were those of\r\nAdmiral Sir James Hope's expedition in 1861. All cargo to or from\r\nSzech'uen is here transhipped from steamer to junk, or _vice versâ_.\r\nAbout 10 m. above I-ch'ang the famed scenery of the Yangtsze gorges\r\nbegins. Through these the great river runs in a series of rapids, which\r\nmake navigation by vessels of any size extremely difficult. A very large\r\ntrade, nevertheless, is carried on by this route between Chungk'ing and\r\nI-ch'ang. As a local centre of distribution this port is of no great\r\nconsequence, the transhipment trade with Szech'uen being almost its sole\r\nbusiness. The population is estimated at 35,000. The number of foreign\r\nresidents is very small, trade being carried on by Chinese agents.\r\nBefore the anti-opium campaign of 1906 (see CHINA) opium was much grown.\r\nThe trade of the port amounted in 1899 to £531,229, and in 1904 to\r\n£424,442, the principal import being cotton yarn and the principal\r\nexport opium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICHNEUMON (Gr. [Greek: ichneumôn], from [Greek: ichneuein], to track\r\nout), the common name of the North African representative of a number of\r\nsmall weasel-shaped mammals belonging to the carnivorous family\r\n_Viverridae_; the Indian representatives of the group being known as\r\nmongooses. A large number of species of the type genus are known, and\r\nrange over southern Asia and all Africa, the typical _Herpestes\r\nichneumon_ also occurring in the south of Spain. The latter is an\r\ninhabitant of Egypt and the north of Africa, where it is known to\r\nforeign residents as \"Pharaoh's rat.\" It is covered with long harsh fur\r\nof a tawny-grey colour, darker on the head and along the middle of the\r\nback, its legs reddish and its feet and tail black. It lives largely on\r\nrats and mice, birds and reptiles, and for this reason it is\r\ndomesticated. It is, however, fond of poultry and their eggs, and its\r\ndepredations among fowls detract from its merits as a vermin-killer.\r\nDuring the inundations of the Nile it is said to approach the\r\nhabitations of man, but at other seasons it keeps to the fields and to\r\nthe banks of the river. The Indian mongoose (_H. mungo_) is considerably\r\nsmaller than the Egyptian animal, with fur of a pale-grey colour, the\r\nhairs being largely white-ringed, while the cheeks and throat are more\r\nor less reddish. Like the former it is frequently domesticated. It is\r\nespecially serviceable in India as a serpent-killer, destroying not only\r\nthe eggs and young of these creatures, but killing the most venomous\r\nadult snakes. The fact that it survives those encounters has led to the\r\nbelief that it either enjoys immunity from the effects of snake poison,\r\nor that after being bitten it has recourse, as the Hindus maintain, to\r\nthe root of a plant as an antidote. It has been found, however, that\r\nwhen actually bitten it falls a victim to the poison as rapidly as other\r\nmammals, while there is no evidence of its seeking a vegetable antidote.\r\nThe truth seems to be that the mongoose, by its exceeding agility and\r\nquickness of eye, avoids the fangs of the snake while fixing its own\r\nteeth in the back of the reptile's neck. Moreover, when excited, the\r\nmongoose erects its long stiff hair, and it must be very difficult for a\r\nsnake to drive its fangs through this and the thick skin which all the\r\nmembers of the genus possess. The mongoose never hesitates to attack a\r\nsnake; the moment he sees his enemy, \"his whole nature,\" writes a\r\nspectator of one of those fights, \"appears to be changed. His fur stands\r\non end, and he presents the incarnation of intense rage. The snake\r\ninvariably attempts to escape, but, finding it impossible to evade the\r\nrapid onslaught of the mongoose, raises his crest and lashes out\r\nfiercely at his little persecutor, who seems to delight in dodging out\r\nof the way just in time. This goes on until the mongoose sees his\r\nopportunity, when like lightning he rushes in and seizes the snake with\r\nhis teeth by the back of the neck close to the head, shaking him as a\r\nterrier does a rat. These tactics are repeated until the snake is\r\nkilled.\" The mongoose is equally dexterous in killing rats and other\r\nfour-footed vermin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Egyptian Ichneumon (_Herpestes ichneumon_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nICHNEUMON-FLY, a general name applied to parasitic insects of the\r\nsection _Ichneumonoidea_ (or _Entomophaga_), order _Hymenoptera_, from\r\nthe typical genus _Ichneumon_, belonging to the chief family of that\r\nsection--itself fancifully so called after the Egyptian mammal\r\n(_Herpestes_). The species of the families (_Ichneumonidae_,\r\n_Braconidae_, _Evaniidae_, _Proctotrypidae_, and _Chalcididae_) are\r\noften indiscriminately called \"Ichneumons,\" but the \"super-family\" of\r\nthe Ichneumonoidea in the classification of W. H. Ashmead contains only\r\nthe _Evaniidae_, the _Stephanidae_, and the large assemblage of insects\r\nusually included in the two families of the _Ichneumonidae_ and the\r\n_Braconidae_, which are respectively equivalent to the _Ichneumones\r\ngenuini_ and _I. adsciti_ of older naturalists, chiefly differing in the\r\nformer having two recurrent nerves to the anterior wing, whilst the\r\nlatter has only one such nerve. The _Ichneumonidae_ proper are one of\r\nthe most extensive groups of insects. Gravenhorst described some 1650\r\nEuropean species, to which considerable subsequent additions have been\r\nmade. There are 6 sub-families of the _Ichneumonidae_, viz. the\r\n_Ichneumoninae_, _Cryptinae_, _Agriotypinae_, _Ophioninae_,\r\n_Tryphoninae_ and _Pimplinae_, differing considerably in size and\r\nfacies, but united in the common attribute of being, in their earlier\r\nstages, parasitic upon other insects. They have all long narrow bodies;\r\na small free head with long filiform or setaceous antennae, which are\r\nnever elbowed, and have always more than sixteen joints; the abdomen\r\nattached to the thorax at its hinder extremity between the base of the\r\nposterior coxae, and provided in the female with a straight ovipositor\r\noften exserted and very long; and the wings veined, with perfect cells\r\non the disk of the front pair. Ashmead proposes to separate the\r\n_Agriotypidae_ (which are remarkable for their aquatic habit, being\r\nparasitic on caddis-worms) from the _Ichneumonidae_ on account of their\r\nfirm ventral abdominal segments and spined scutellum. He also separates\r\nfrom the _Braconidae_ the _Alysiidae_ as a distinct family; they have\r\npeculiar mandibles with out-turned tips.\r\n\r\nTheir parasitic habits render these flies of great importance in the\r\neconomy of nature, as they serve to check any inordinate increase in the\r\nnumbers of injurious insects. Without their aid it would in many cases\r\nbe impossible for the agriculturist to hold his own against the ravages\r\nof his minute insect foes, whose habits are not sufficiently known to\r\nrender artificial checks or destroying agents available. The females of\r\nall the species are constantly on the alert to discover the proper\r\nliving food for their own larvae, which are hatched from the eggs they\r\ndeposit in or on the eggs, larvae or pupae of other insects of all\r\norders, chiefly _Lepidoptera_, the caterpillars of butterflies and moths\r\nbeing specially attacked (as also are spiders). Any one who has watched\r\ninsect life during the summer can hardly have failed to notice the busy\r\nway in which the parent ichneumon, a small four-winged fly, with\r\nconstantly vibrating antennae, searches for her prey; and the clusters\r\nof minute cocoons round the remains of some cabbage-butterfly\r\ncaterpillar must also have been observed by many. This is the work of\r\n_Apanteles_ (or _Microgaster_) _glomeratus_, one of the _Braconidae_,\r\nwhich in days past was a source of disquietude to naturalists, who\r\nbelieved that the life of the one defunct larva had _transmigrated_ into\r\nthe numerous smaller flies reared from it. Ichneumon-flies which attack\r\nexternal feeders have a short ovipositor, but those attached to\r\nwood-feeding insects have that organ of great length, for the purpose of\r\nreaching the haunts of their concealed prey. Thus a species from Japan\r\n(_Bracon penetrator_) has its ovipositor nine times the length of the\r\nbody; and the large species of _Rhyssa_ and _Ephialtes_, parasitic on\r\n_Sirex_ and large wood-boring beetles in temperate Europe, have very\r\nlong instruments (with which when handled they will endeavour to sting,\r\nsometimes penetrating the skin), in order to get at their secreted\r\nvictims. A common reddish-coloured species of _Ophion_ (_O. obscurum_),\r\nwith a sabre-shaped abdomen, is noteworthy from the fact of its eggs\r\nbeing attached by stalks outside the body of the caterpillar of the\r\npuss-moth (_Cerura vinula_). Lepidopterists wishing to breed the latter\r\ncut off the eggs of the parasite with scissors.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the ichneumon-flies are white, fleshy, cylindrical,\r\nfootless grubs; the majority of them spin silk cocoons before pupating,\r\noften in a mass (sometimes almost geometrically), and sometimes in\r\nlayers of different colours and texture.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Among the older works on Ichneumonoidea may be specially\r\n  mentioned J.
