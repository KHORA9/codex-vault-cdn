The geographic concept of the Ukraine does not exist in\r\nthe geography of today. Even the name has been almost forgotten in\r\nEurope in the course of the last century and a half. Only occasionally\r\non some maps of Eastern Europe the name “Ukraine” shows timidly along\r\nthe middle of the Dnieper. And yet it is an old name of the country,\r\noriginating in the 11th Century, generally known thruout Europe from\r\nthe 16th to the end of the 18th century, and then, after the abrogation\r\nof the autonomy of the second Ukrainian state, gradually fallen into\r\noblivion. The Russian Government has determined to erase the old name\r\nof the land and the nation from the map of Europe. Little Russia, West\r\nRussia, South Russia, New Russia, were officially introduced in place\r\nof the old name Ukraine, the Austrian part of the Ukraine receiving the\r\nname of East Galicia. The people were named Little Russians, South\r\nRussians, Ruthenians, and all remembrance of the old name seemed to\r\nhave been blotted out. But, in the speech of the people and in the\r\nmagnificent unwritten popular literature of the nation, the name of the\r\nland could not be destroyed, and, with the unexpected rise of Ukrainian\r\nliterature, culture, and a feeling of national political independence\r\nin the 19th Century, the name Ukraine came into its own again. Today\r\nthere is not an intelligent patriotic Ukrainian who would use another\r\nname for his country and nation than Ukraine and Ukrainian, and,\r\nslowly, these designations are penetrating foreign lands as well.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine is the land in which the Ukrainian nation dwells—a great\r\nsolid national territory embracing all the southern part of Russia in\r\nEurope, besides East Galicia, Northwest Bukowina and Northeast Hungary.\r\n\r\nThis district is a definite geographic unit. A discussion of its exact\r\nboundaries shall be reserved for the anthropogeographical part of this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nA division of Europe into natural regions almost invariably stops at\r\nEastern Europe. While all the other portions of our globe have long\r\nbeen the object of the most detailed classification, Eastern Europe\r\nremains, as before, an undivided whole. To be sure, there have been\r\nmany attempts at classification, but they are all based upon a\r\nnon-geographical point of view. Only the Baltic provinces and Poland\r\nare, in their present political extent, regarded as possible geographic\r\nunits.\r\n\r\nThese deficiencies in the geographic material relating to Eastern\r\nEurope are due, above all, to our imperfect knowledge of this great\r\nregion. Russian science is devoting far more intensive study to the\r\nAsiatic borderlands of the immense empire than to the European home\r\ncountry. For this reason, our literary aids in this direction are few\r\nand unreliable. The latter criticism applies even to the twenty-volume\r\nGeography of Russia by Semyonoff and the Geography of Krassnoff. Apart\r\nfrom the consideration that it is relatively out of date, the fifth\r\nvolume of Reclus’ “Géographie universelle” still offers the best\r\ninsight into this unique region of Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nIf we glance at the map of Eastern Europe, we perceive at once that the\r\ngreat uniformity of this immense region makes it quite impossible to\r\napply to Eastern Europe as a criterion the division of Western or\r\nCentral Europe. It is not seas and mountains that separate the natural\r\nregions and anthropogeographical units of Eastern Europe, but\r\nimperceptible morphological transitions, hydrographic and climatic\r\nboundaries, petrologic and floral conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine is an Eastern European country. Its situation, its\r\ndecidedly continental character, its geologic history, tectonic\r\nconstruction and morphologic conditions, its climate, plant and animal\r\nlife, its anthropogeography—all are characteristic of Eastern Europe.\r\nBut within Eastern Europe the Ukraine occupies a unique position, which\r\nfully warrants our conceiving of this great land as a geographic unit\r\nstanding on an equal basis with the other natural units, as Great\r\nRussia, North Russia, the Ural, White Russia, the Baltic Provinces. But\r\nit also forms a characteristic transition country from Eastern to\r\nCentral and Southern Europe on the one side, and to Western Asia on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe location of the Ukraine causes us necessarily to consider it as the\r\neasternmost of the Mediterranean countries of Europe. The Ukraine\r\ndiffers from these other Mediterranean countries in that it is not\r\nhemmed in on the north by mountains. The back-country of the Black Sea,\r\nwhich the Ukraine really is, therefore merges gradually into the lands\r\nlying further to the north—Great Russia and White Russia. Of all the\r\nregions of Eastern Europe, the Ukraine alone has access to the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe geological history of the Ukraine is entirely different from that\r\nof the rest of Europe. The pre-Cambrian core of gneiss-granite of the\r\nUkraine, unlike other parts of Eastern Europe, was not flooded by the\r\nsea either in the Cambrian period or the lower Silurian, while in the\r\nupper Silurian the sea covered only a slight part of Western Podolia\r\nand Northern Bessarabia. The Devonian sea crossed the boundaries of the\r\nUkraine only in the farthest east (Donetz Plateau) and west (Western\r\nPodolia). The carbon deposits and Permian formations, so widely\r\ndistributed in Eastern Europe, are found in the Ukraine only on the\r\nDonetz; triassic rock hardly at all. The Jurassic Sea confined its\r\naction almost wholly to the plicated borderlands of the Ukraine, altho\r\nit actually flooded great stretches of Eastern Europe. Only the\r\nextension of the chalk seas thru Eastern Europe affected Ukrainian\r\nterritory, especially the northern and western borderlands. The old\r\ntertiary sea, on the other hand, confined itself for the most part to\r\nthe Ukraine, with the result that a goodly section of the northeastern\r\nboundary of the old tertiary deposits coincides exactly with the\r\nanthropogeographical boundaries of the Ukraine. The inland seas of the\r\nlower green-sand formation of Eastern Europe, too, are confined almost\r\nentirely to Ukrainian territory.\r\n\r\nThe geologic history of the Ukraine in the diluvian period was also\r\ndecidedly different from that of the other districts of Eastern Europe.\r\nThe Northern European inland ice covered the northwestern borderlands\r\nof the Ukraine only in the main ice period, for the boundary set for\r\nthe glaciation of the north, on the basis of the investigations of\r\nRussian scholars, applies in great measure only to the limits of the\r\ndistribution of northern glacial boulders, which were carried to their\r\npresent site not by ice but by flowing water. The two indentations of\r\nthe glaciation-boundary in the Don and Dnieper district merely mark the\r\nsphere of action of two glacial river systems.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a one-time inland-ice-cap differentiates the Ukrainian\r\ndistrict very markedly from the other parts of Eastern Europe. As we\r\nperceive, even from this short description, the Ukraine has had an\r\nentirely different geologic history from the rest of Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nMore plainly still, the independence of the Ukraine as a natural unit\r\nis revealed in its contour-line and surface-relief. The Ukraine is the\r\nonly portion of the Eastern European plain which has access to the\r\nmountainous region, for it rests upon the Carpathians, the Yaila\r\nMountains and the Caucasus. Important individual districts of the\r\nUkraine lie in these mountains and lessen the Eastern European\r\nuniformity of the country. The formation of the Yaila and the Caucasus\r\nbegan at the end of the Jurassic period—its completion and the building\r\nup of the Carpathians occur in the late tertiary period.\r\n\r\nThe plains and plateau of the Ukraine, while at first glance quite\r\nsimilar to those of Central Russia, are in reality very different from\r\nthese as to structure and surface-relief. The nucleus of the Ukrainian\r\nplateau group, which is surrounded by the two plain districts of the\r\nUkraine, consists of the so-called Azof Horst (so named by E. Suess),\r\nwhich stretches from the banks of the Sea of Azof in a northwesterly\r\ndirection as far as Volhynia and Austrian Podolia. This primeval rock\r\nsurface, composed of granite gneiss, is bounded by quarries and edged\r\nwith declivities, which are hidden by more recent sediment deposits.\r\nSince this extended Horst stretches thru practically the whole length\r\nof the Ukraine, we shall call it “the Ukrainian Horst.”\r\n\r\nThis Ukrainian Horst is of great importance for the entire process of\r\nfolding, all over the earth. To the west of this Horst is the immense\r\nfold-system of the Altai, folded far into North America toward the\r\nnorth and northeast, in direct opposition to the main parts of the\r\nenormous system which lie to the east of it. In the east of the Horst\r\nwe see the straight line of the mountain system of the Caucasus; in the\r\nwest the winding guide-lines of Central Europe.\r\n\r\nThe region of the Ukrainian Horst has influenced not only the formation\r\nof the plicated country. In connection with it we find, arranged on a\r\ngrand scale, but not very intensive, disintegrating lines, which\r\ntraverse the entire Ukrainian country from N. W. to S. E. These\r\ntectonic disturbances have led to strong folding and dislocation of the\r\nmore recent sedimentary layers which lie close to the Horst. This\r\nfolding district can be observed only in the trunk range on the Donetz\r\nand in a few isolated places to the northwest; beyond this it is buried\r\nunder the huge cover of the tertiary layers. The folding process took\r\nplace in the Donetz Mountains, continuing with long interruptions from\r\nthe end of the paleozoic era to the beginning of the tertiary period.\r\nAs pre-tertiary disturbances of this kind we consider the disturbance\r\nof Isatchky, Trekhtimiriv, etc., as well as some dividing lines at the\r\nnorthwestern extremity of the Ukrainian Horst.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the Ukrainian Horst was also the origin of more\r\nrecent tectonic disturbances—tertiary and post-tertiary. The two main\r\nlines of Karpinsky (the northern—Volga, bend of the Don, source of the\r\nDonetz, delta of the Desna, South Polissye, Warsaw; the southern—delta\r\nof the Don, end of the Porohy of the Dnieper, source of the Boh,\r\nWestern Podolia) for the most part go back to these more recent\r\npost-cretaceous disturbances. Besides, we are already able, despite our\r\ninsufficient morphological data on the Ukraine, to establish the fact\r\nthat the entire Ukrainian plateau-group is the scene of a significant\r\npost-glacial elevation. The strikingly parallel courses of the main\r\nstreams, the Dniester, the Boh, the Dnieper as far as Katerinoslav, the\r\nDonetz and the Don, together with the precipices frequently\r\naccompanying them, lead us to infer the existence of tectonic\r\ninfluences. That the precipices of Podolia are very recent we may now\r\nconfidently maintain, and that the precipitous bank of the Dnieper is\r\nquite as recent is shown by the familiar dislocation near Kaniv, where\r\nthe tertiary is affected. Seismic movements of the most recent past and\r\nmorphological observations show us that the tectonic disturbances of\r\nthe Ukraine are continuing into our own day.\r\n\r\nFrom this tectonic characterization of the Ukraine we perceive that\r\nthis country occupies an independent position in relation to the rest\r\nof Eastern Europe. The much more intensive tectonic disturbances of the\r\nUkrainian region have produced a greater variety of plateau and plain\r\ncountry here than in White, Great or North Russia. The Ukrainian\r\nplateaus attain the contour-lines of 400 and even 500 meters and reveal\r\nprecipices of tectonic origin, which for a long time were considered\r\nproof of Baer’s law and have recently been explained as Davis Cuestas.\r\nThe extensive working out of valleys in the Ukrainian plateau regions,\r\nthe characteristic cañon-like type of the valleys, the frequent\r\noccurrence of hills formed by erosion, lack of glacial formations and\r\ndeposits, but evidences of great erosive and flattening action—these\r\nare the chief elements of difference between the plateau lands of the\r\nUkraine and other Eastern European plateau lands. The plains of the\r\nUkraine possess similarities to neighboring Central Europe only in the\r\nNorthwest. Beyond this, they are all more or less decided steppes, the\r\nlike of which are not met with in Central Europe, Hungary not excepted.\r\nAt the same time the character of the steppes of the Ukraine is\r\ndifferent from that of the steppe-region of Eastern Russia as well,\r\nchiefly because of the detail of the country and the peculiarities of\r\nvegetation, which are occasioned by differences of climate.\r\n\r\nHydrographically the Ukraine is distinguished by a web of rivers\r\nconcentrating in the Pontus. The Ukraine embraces the river systems of\r\nthe Dniester, Boh, Dnieper, Don and Kuban—not entirely, to be sure, yet\r\nby far the greater part, leaving only the sources of the two greatest\r\nrivers to the White and Great Russians. Only the most western\r\nborderlands of the Ukraine lie within the watersheds of the Baltic\r\nRivers (the Vistula district); only the most eastern mountain-spurs in\r\nthe water-shed of the Caspian Sea (Terek and Kuma). We may therefore,\r\nwithout hesitation, conceive of the Ukraine hydrographically as the\r\nnorthern part of the Eastern European water-shed.\r\n\r\nIn respect to climate, the Ukraine occupies an independent position in\r\nEastern Europe. In fact, de Martonne recently declared “the Ukrainian\r\nclimate to be one of the main types of climate of the earth.” We shall\r\nnot go so far as this, but we must emphasize the fact that the climate\r\nof the Ukraine differs no less from that of Poland, White Russia and\r\nGreat Russia than does Germany’s climate from that of England or\r\nFrance. An important wind-partition crosses the Ukraine in winter from\r\nEast to West, subjecting the entire southern part to the sway of the\r\neast wind. Winter in the Ukraine is strictly continental, with a\r\ncoldness of 30 degrees, but not with the semi-polar character of the\r\nRussian or the Central European character of the Polish winter. The\r\neast and southeast winds by day prevent the snow-blankets, produced by\r\nthe moist south winds of the Pontus, from ever becoming too heavy,\r\nespecially in the Southern Ukraine, and cause them to disappear quickly\r\nin the spring. In the spring the temperature rises very rapidly. The\r\nsummer of the Ukraine is the hot continental summer, and despite the\r\npredominant Atlantic west winds and the abundant precipitation, it is\r\nnot sultry. Autumn is pleasant and dry.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Ukraine, then, is the continental climate of the\r\nPontus. Toward the west it merges into the Central European climatic\r\nzone at the border of Poland, into the Eastern European continental\r\nclimate at the border of White and Great Russia, into the Aralo-Caspian\r\ndry climate at the eastern border. The southern borderlands of the\r\nUkraine, like those of France, constitute a transition to the\r\nMediterranean climate.\r\n\r\nIn respect to its flora, the unique position of the Ukraine depends\r\nupon the fact that it embraces almost the entire region of the\r\nprairie-steppes of the Pontus, with their regions of transition to the\r\nNorthern and Central European forest zone. Right east of the Don begin\r\nthe steppes and desert-steppes of the Caspian region. Consequently, the\r\nUkraine is the only country in Europe which has the prevailing\r\ncharacter of the steppes. Here, again, this circumstance is of\r\ngeographical importance and makes the Ukraine, in this respect also, a\r\ngeographic unit.\r\n\r\nThe most important signs of independence as a geographic unit, however,\r\nare imparted to the Ukraine by its anthropogeographical conditions, to\r\nwhich we shall turn our attention in Book II of this little work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now become acquainted with the natural foundations of the\r\nUkraine as a geographic unit. One important characteristic of this\r\ngeographic entity must especially attract our attention. The name of\r\nthe country is Ukraine, which means border-country, march-land. It is\r\nan old historical name which originated in the course of the centuries\r\nand has become customary. And yet it is significant as hardly another\r\nname of a land or people could well be. For the Ukraine is a true\r\nborderland Europe, between Eastern Europe, and Western Asia. It lies on\r\nthe borders of the European plicated mountain-girdle and of the Eastern\r\nEuropean table-land. The Ukrainian Horst constitutes a tectonic\r\nborder-post for the development of the entire European folded area. In\r\nthe morphological sense as well, the Ukraine constitutes a decided\r\nborderland. Here the glacial formations give way to the erosive and\r\nflattening formation. Climatologically, too, the Ukraine is a decided\r\nborderland. Yet, most of all, does the character of the Ukraine as a\r\nland of boundaries and transitions appear in its biogeographical and\r\nanthropogeographical conditions. In the Ukraine are merged the\r\nboundaries of two European forest regions—of the sub-steppes,\r\ntransition-steppe, prairie-steppe zone, and of the Mediterranean\r\nregion. The Ukraine is situated upon the boundaries of the European\r\nfamily of peoples—of Slavdom, of European culture—and, at the same\r\ntime, upon the boundaries of that anthropogeographical structure which\r\nis so remarkable and so little known—the body social of Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION AND SIZE\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine lies between 43° and 54° north latitude and between 21° and\r\n47° east longitude from Greenwich. If we look for our country on a map\r\nwe will find that it lies as the northern hinterland of the Black Sea,\r\nin the southern part of Eastern Europe, just on the threshold of Asia.\r\nFrom the foot of the Tatra Mountains, from the sunny Hegyalia and\r\ncloud-wreathed Chornohora, from the silver-rippled San, from the dark\r\nvirgin forest of Biloveza and the immense swamps of Polissye, to the\r\ndelta of the Danube—so often sung in the lore of the Ukrainian folk—to\r\nthe Black Sea, to the gigantic Caucasians and the Caspian, surrounded\r\nby brown desert steppes, extends our fatherland, the Ukraine. From the\r\nbeginnings of the historical life of Eastern Europe, for one thousand\r\ntwo hundred years, the Ukrainian race has resided in this region, and\r\nhas been able, not only to preserve its boundaries, but, after heavy\r\nlosses, to regain and even to pass beyond them. And this continued thru\r\ncenturies of stress, thru bloody wars, after the loss of the first and\r\nsecond national governments, and under the merciless pressure of\r\nneighboring states and peoples. That other nations, as the French, the\r\nItalians, the Spaniards, should have preserved their original seats, is\r\nnot surprising; they were protected on all sides by high mountains and\r\ndeep seas. All the more, therefore, must we admire the great vitality\r\nof the Ukrainian nation, which has been able to retain in its\r\npossession a mother-country lying open, almost without any protection,\r\nto mighty enemies.\r\n\r\nFor the Ukraine lies at the southeastern edge of Europe, on the\r\nthreshold of Asia, at the point where the easiest overland route\r\nconnects the two continents. For an entire period of a thousand years,\r\nthis border position was most disadvantageous and dangerous for the\r\nUkraine; for Nature and History did not bring the Ukraine, placed as it\r\nis, into the proximity of that part of Asia which for thousands of\r\nyears past had been inhabited by the rich civilizations of that\r\ncontinent. The Ukraine has always been the nearest European neighbor of\r\nthe steppe-country of Central Asia. There, from the earliest beginnings\r\nof history, dwelt pillaging hordes of Nomads, who would flood Europe\r\nfrom this point. The Pontian steppes of the Southern Ukraine were, for\r\nthese steppe-people, the natural military road to the West and\r\nSouthwest, where the rich, civilized lands of the Mediterranean region\r\nlay invitingly open. For more than a thousand years, from the\r\nbeginnings of the history of the Ukraine, these nomadic Asiatic tribes\r\ntraversed the South Ukrainian steppes, covering the entire Ukraine with\r\nwar and unspeakable misery. Huns, Avars, Khazars, Magyars, Pechenegs,\r\nTorks, Berendians, Polovs, Tatars, Kalmucks, infested the Ukraine in\r\nsuccession. Of all the European peoples, the Ukrainians always had to\r\nbe the first to oppose these steppe-plunderers. The nomads always had\r\nfirst to force their way thru the Ukraine. Many of them were\r\nannihilated by the ancient Ukrainians; thus, the Khazars, Pechenegs,\r\nTorks and Berendians; others were held off, as the Polovs or the\r\nKalmucks. But the Ukraine exhausted its strength in this eternal\r\nwarfare, and, in the terrible stress occasioned by the Tatars, lost\r\ntheir ancient culture and their mighty state.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, any one of the European nations may claim the credit of\r\nhaving been Europe’s shield against Asiatic barbarism, it is the\r\nhalf-forgotten Ukrainian nation.\r\n\r\nThe border position of the Ukraine was fatal also, for the reason that\r\nthe country lay, and lies, so far distant from the cultural centers of\r\nEurope. As long as the Byzantine Empire, with its cultural wealth,\r\nremained firm, a strong stream of culture flowed from the Pontus into\r\nthe Ukraine. The decline and fall of the Byzantine Empire suddenly\r\ntransferred the Ukraine to the furthest (in respect to culture) corner\r\nof Europe, close to the Ottoman Empire, which was at that time hostile\r\nto culture. The western neighbors of the Ukraine, the Magyars and\r\nPoles, acquired little of the culture of Western Europe in the time of\r\ntheir independence, and allowed still less to slip thru into the\r\nUkraine. The Russians entered the circle of European culture only two\r\ncenturies ago, and have made only superficial cultural progress since.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the geographical location of the Ukraine is not without\r\nfavorable features. The Ukraine embraces the entire northern coast of\r\nthe Black Sea and the Sea of Azof, and holds considerable possibilities\r\nfor oversea commerce. The proximity of Asia is no longer dangerous,\r\nbut, on the contrary, very advantageous. A century and a half has\r\npassed since the power of the steppe-races was finally broken. Their\r\nheritage has been taken possession of, altho in a different manner, by\r\nthe Ukrainian peasant, who has thickly settled the Pontian steppes.\r\nWith plow in hand, he has reconquered the lands which his ancestors\r\ntried in vain to defend with the sword. Ukrainian colonization is still\r\nadvancing irresistibly in the Crimea and in the fore-country of the\r\nCaucasus, and will, no doubt, within a very short time, flood these\r\ncountries completely.\r\n\r\nA further advantage of location lies in the circumstance that the\r\nUkraine is situated on the shortest land-route from Central Europe to\r\nthe southern part of Central Asia and India, and commands a good\r\nportion of this route. This fact may, in the very near future, be of\r\nthe greatest political and economic importance. At the same time, the\r\nUkraine is the only one of all the East European countries which, thru\r\nits location, stands in the closest relations to the Mediterranean\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nReserving the detailed discussion of the Ukraine’s geographical\r\nlocation for the anthropogeographical part of my little book, let us\r\nnow consider the size of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe area of the Ukrainian territory is 850,000 square kilometers.\r\n\r\nWe see before us, therefore, a European country which is surpassed in\r\narea only by present-day Russia in Europe. No European people, with the\r\nsolitary exception of the Russians, possesses so large a compact\r\nnational territory as the Ukrainians. This characteristically Eastern\r\nEuropean spaciousness of the territory, combined with the natural\r\nwealth of the region would, if coupled with Western European culture,\r\nmake a fit dwelling-place for a world-power. On such ground as this,\r\nthe possibilities for the development of a material and intellectual\r\nculture are almost unlimited.\r\n\r\nBut alas! The greatest poet of the Ukraine, Taras Shevchenko, has\r\ncharacterized his fatherland all too fittingly as “Our Land, but not\r\nbelonging to us.” Upon its large and rich territory the Ukrainian\r\nnation has had to endure so many hard buffets of fate, that it must be\r\nconsidered, along with the Jews, the most sorely tried civilized race\r\non earth. Even down to the present moment the Ukrainians are a helot\r\nrace, which is forced to unearth the treasures of its fatherland for\r\nits hostile neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK SEA AND ITS COASTS\r\n\r\nAltho for many centuries separated from the Pontus by the nomad-haunted\r\nsteppe-border, the Ukrainian nation is closely identified with this\r\nsea. An enormous number of legends and songs of the Ukrainian people\r\ndeal with it; even in fanciful love-songs it is mentioned. And the\r\nintimacy of this East European nation with the Sea need not surprise\r\nus. The Black Sea, with which so much in Ukrainian song and story is\r\nconnected, has had a significance in the history of the Ukraine which\r\nhas not been forgotten in the unwritten traditions of the people. How\r\nmany cultural and warlike memories are connected with the Black Sea!\r\nHow much Ukrainian blood has mingled with its waters!\r\n\r\nThe Black Sea is not large (450,000 square kilometers). It is a\r\nlandlocked sea, situated between Europe and Asia, and connected with\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea by the narrow Straits of the Bosphorus and the\r\nDardanelles and the Sea of Marmora, which, geologically speaking, is a\r\nbasin formed by subsidence. Great subsidences of the earth’s surface\r\ncreated the deep basin of the Pontus. The Pontus was a part of the\r\nextensive upper Miocene and Sarmatian inland sea, which slightly\r\nflooded large districts of the present European continent as far as the\r\nVienna basin. Toward the end of the tertiary period, this inland sea\r\nshrank and separated into single sea basins. The Pontian basin became\r\nconnected with the Mediterranean Sea later, in the latter part of the\r\ndiluvial period, by means of great subsidences of recent date.\r\n\r\nThe present morphology of the Pontus is in full accord with this\r\ngenesis. The northern part, as far as the line of communication between\r\nthe Balkan and Yaila Mountains, is a shallow sea of a depth of less\r\nthan 200 meters; the so-called bay of Odessa is barely 50 meters deep;\r\nthe Sea of Azof, projecting to the northeast, barely 15 meters. But\r\njust on the southern border of the line of plicated mountains, which is\r\nbroken at this point, the bottom of the Black Sea declines rapidly to\r\ngreater depths (1500 meters) until, declining more gradually now, it\r\nattains the depth of 2245 meters in the center of the oval-shaped main\r\nbasin of the Pontus.\r\n\r\nThe salt content of the Black Sea is much smaller than that of the\r\nocean, or even of the Mediterranean. The Sea is comparatively small,\r\nand receives a great deal of fresh water from the many and large rivers\r\nof the region which it drains, while the influx of salt water from the\r\nMediterranean thru the shallow straits cannot be great. The salt\r\ncontent is on the average 1.8%; only at great depths does it reach\r\n2.2%. The diluted surface layer shows barely 1.5% salt content; the Sea\r\nof Azof hardly 1%. The surface water, containing little salt but a\r\ngreat deal of air, cannot, because of the greater density of the lower\r\nlayers of water, sink far, and this low degree of ventilation accounts\r\nfor the fact that the waters of the Black Sea below a depth of 230\r\nmeters are saturated with sulphide of hydrogen, and thus preclude any\r\npossibility of organic deep-sea life.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Black Sea is notable for its beautiful blue-green\r\ncolor and the great transparency of its waters. A white disc, on being\r\nsubmerged, disappeared only at a depth of 77 meters.\r\n\r\nThe surface temperature of the Black Sea is subject to many\r\nfluctuations; from 27° C in midsummer to 5° C in winter. In severe\r\nwinters the Sea is frozen over in the bay of Odessa for a short time;\r\nthe Limans and the Sea of Azof regularly for from two to three months.\r\n\r\nThe Black Sea has been known since hoary antiquity as a dangerous,\r\nstormy sea. The waves, running as high as 10 meters, the short\r\ncross-waves caused by the proximity of the shores, the difficult\r\napproaches to the land, are still a great hindrance to navigation,\r\nespecially in the winter time. Not without cause did the Greeks\r\noriginally call it “the inhospitable sea,” until the great number of\r\nflourishing Greek settlements on its shores led them to change its name\r\nto “hospitable sea.” Despite this euphemistic name, however, “Pontus\r\nEuxeinos,” the Black Sea has devoured many goods and lives, many Greek\r\nand Roman ships, many Turkish and Genoese galleys, many English and\r\nRussian steamers. And many a little Zaporog vessel sank in the dark\r\nwaves of its native sea, “on white cliffs dashed to pieces,” as is\r\nrelated in the old folk-epics; many a one was driven to far-off hostile\r\nTurkish shores, to the destruction of its crews.\r\n\r\nBeing a closed interior sea, the Pontus has no noticeable tides. Marked\r\nchanges of level are caused by the action of the wind. In the liman of\r\nthe Boh, for example, they produce 20 centimeters difference of level\r\nin a day, sometimes even 40 centimeters; in the bay of Yahórlik as much\r\nas 46 centimeters. The Sea of Azof becomes 45 to 90 centimeters deeper\r\nwhen there is a west wind, up to 1 meter deeper in the case of south\r\nwinds, and shallower by an equal amount when the winds are in the\r\nopposite direction. Slight changes of level are dependent also on the\r\nseasons. The Black Sea has its lowest water level in February, when the\r\nregion which it drains is covered with snow; the highest in May and\r\nJune, as a result of the melting of the snows and the early summer\r\nrains. These fluctuations, however, amount to only 25 cm. The currents\r\nof the Black Sea, too, are inconsiderable, because of its isolation.\r\nOutside of local currents which are caused by winds, we know of only\r\none greater current, weak in itself, which encircles the Pontian Basin\r\nin a counter clock-wise direction and may be traced to the cyclonal\r\nmotion of the air. The same conditions obtain on a smaller scale on the\r\nSea of Azof and are reflected in the direction of the tongues of land\r\nalong the coasts.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the deep-sea region of the Black Sea is poisoned\r\nwith sulphide of hydrogen, it possesses a rich flora and fauna in its\r\nsurface layers. Enormous shoals of all kinds of fish—sturgeon, hausen,\r\nsterlet, “kephal,” “bichok,” “balmut,” come to the coast and into the\r\nlimans of the river deltas. For this reason the Pontian fishing\r\nindustry has been considerable for thousands of years. The extraction\r\nof salt from the limans and salt lakes is also important. Before the\r\nage of the railroad the abundance of fish and salt of the Black Sea\r\ncreated a special trucking trade in the Ukraine, the so-called Chumaki,\r\nwho came to the Pontian strand in whole caravans of oxcarts to take\r\ndried fish and salt in exchange for grain.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea begins at the delta of the Danube\r\nand ends at the western spurs of the Caucasus. The greater part is flat\r\ncoast, the smaller, steep coast.\r\n\r\nAt the northern Kilian arm of the Danube delta, where now the\r\ndescendants of the Zaporog Cossacks gain a scanty living thru fishing,\r\nbegins the coast of the Ukraine. The steppe approaches the sea with a\r\nsteep declivity, which is bordered by a narrow strand of sand and\r\npebbles. The coast runs evenly as far as the Dnieper delta, without any\r\nindentations. Even the famous port of Odessa is an artificial harbor.\r\n\r\nOnly at a point where a river, a streamlet, even a balka (step-glen,\r\nravine) opens into the sea, is the steep incline of the steppe-plateau\r\nbroken. We then see before us an enormous pond as it were, at the upper\r\nend of which the water-course enters and the lower end of which is\r\nlocked from the sea side by a land-tongue or bar (Kossá, Peresip) as by\r\na flat dam. This sea-water lake is called liman in Ukrainian.\r\n\r\nWherever a stream of great volume empties into a liman, the bar is\r\nsevered at one or more places. These liman deltas are called, in\r\nUkrainian, hirló. Limans which have such connections with the sea are\r\nbroken. Of such a kind are the limans of the Kunduk, Dniester, Boh and\r\nDnieper. Where a little streamlet discharges which has not a sufficient\r\nvolume of water to cover the loss from evaporation of the liman surface\r\nand still retain an excess for keeping open the outlet, then the bar of\r\nthe liman is without an opening and the water contains a great deal of\r\nsalt. Of this kind are, above all, the limans of Kuyalnik and Khadshibé\r\nnear Odessa, the large, deep Tilihúl and many smaller ones. The water\r\nand the mud of such limans possess healing powers, and every summer\r\nthousands of patients travel to the hot shores of the limans to regain\r\ntheir health.\r\n\r\nThe limans are simply submerged eroded valleys of steppe rivers which\r\nare now being filled in by alluvial deposits. Therefore, the limans of\r\nall larger rivers are too shallow to serve as good harbors for the\r\nlarger sea-going vessels. The liman of the Dniester allows entrance\r\nonly to small ships drawing two meters of water; the gigantic Dnieper\r\nliman is only 6 m. deep, and only the Boh liman is accessible to larger\r\nsea-going ships. Systematic dredging, however, could, without a doubt,\r\nbring relief, and would change a number of the limans into profitable\r\nharbors.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the liman of the Dnieper, the coast is strongly indented\r\nas far as the bay of Karkinit, but these indentations (Yahórlik,\r\nTendra, Kharilgach) are closed off by long tongues of land and the\r\nundersea extension of the bar of Bakalsk. The west coast of Crimea is\r\nalso a uniform liman coast, increasing constantly in height, however,\r\ntoward the south. At the Alma delta the coast becomes steep and has two\r\nexcellent harbors, Sevastopol and Balaklava, which are submerged deep\r\nvalleys. The southeast coast of the Crimean peninsula is a strongly\r\nmarked acclivitous shore. The steep descent of the Yaila Mountains has\r\nbeen transformed here, thru the abrasive action of the sea, into a\r\nbeautiful coastline. Eruptive rock, capable of offering great\r\nresistance, is found here in places, forming picturesque capes, jetties\r\nand crags, between which lie pretty little bays and coves. The\r\nagreeable climate, the clear sky, the good sea-baths and the beautiful\r\ncountry annually lure to this Ukrainian Riviera thousands of\r\nconsumptives and health-seekers. There are rows and rows of\r\ncottage-colonies and mansions.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the crescent-shaped bay of Feodosia, the coast again\r\nbecomes lower and also has a number of salty lagoons and bars. Of the\r\nsame description are the coasts of the Strait of Kerch, leading into\r\nthe Sea of Azof, which is 35,000 sq. km. in area. This extremely flat\r\nsea is often compared to a liman. Numerous tongues of land (Biriucha,\r\nObitochna, Berdianska, Kossa, etc.) jut out here into the sea, showing\r\nvery clearly in their direction the effect of the cyclonal motion of\r\nthe air. The low coast has an enormous number of limans and lagoons,\r\ne.g., Utluk, Mius, Molochni, Yeski, Akhtirski, Tamanski, Kisiltash,\r\netc. The most remarkable part of the Sea of Azof, however, is the\r\nSivash. A bar 111 km. in length shuts the Sivash off from the Sea of\r\nAzof, leaving only a connecting passage of 150 m., near Henichesk. The\r\ncuriously ragged banks of red-clay, the salt swamps, lagoons and\r\nislands, the bracken, ill-smelling water, which is salty in summer, and\r\nin a few spots at other times as well, have given the Sivash the name\r\nof Foul Sea (Hnile More).\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of the Ukraine’s Black Sea coast is a mountainous\r\ncliff-coast again. The plications of the western Caucasus, which\r\napproach the sea obliquely, are here so quickly destroyed by the\r\npowerful abrasive action of the surf, that the erosive action of the\r\nrivers and mountain streams cannot keep pace. Therefore, the crest is\r\ndifficult of access and only the two harbors of Novorossiysk and\r\nGelendshik offer shelter for ships along this part of the coast. But\r\neven this shelter is doubtful, because of the bora-like winds.\r\n\r\nAs we perceive from this description of the Ukrainian coast, it is not\r\none which would promote navigation among the inhabitants. Lack of\r\nharbors, isolation, remoteness from the main lines of the world’s\r\ntraffic, never could have an encouraging effect upon the development of\r\nnavigation among the Ukrainians. Despite all this, however, they\r\ndeveloped very high seafaring qualities in the time of the old Kingdom\r\nof Kiev and later on in the Cossack period, and the present age, too,\r\nhas brought a revival of the nautical skill of the Ukrainian coast\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SURVEY OF THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF UKRAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UKRAINIAN MOUNTAIN COUNTRY\r\n\r\nGlancing at the map of the Ukraine, we perceive at once that in this\r\ncountry we should seek in vain for such a variety of surface\r\nconfiguration as is peculiar to Central or Western Europe. In Germany\r\nor France there appear in a comparatively small space the most varied\r\nlandscape—chains of high mountains, central chains of mountains,\r\nterrace and hill country, plateaus and plains.\r\n\r\nIt is different here in our wide Ukraine. One can travel hundreds of\r\nmiles in any direction without seeing a change in the character of the\r\nscenery. The uniformity which is typical for Eastern Europe is peculiar\r\nalso to the Ukraine. But not to the extent that it is to Great Russia,\r\nwhere the endlessness of the flat country wearies the eye of the\r\ntraveler. For there are in the Ukraine landscapes of high and central\r\nchains of mountains, picturesque hill districts and richly cut\r\nplateaus, marshy plains and steppes strewn with barrows. There is,\r\nthen, in the Ukraine, a variety of surface configuration, but on a\r\nlarge scale, not as in Western or Central Europe, confined in a small\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThe morphological nucleus of the Ukraine is the closed group of\r\nplateaus, which extends from the country at the foot of the Carpathians\r\nand the Polish part of the Vistula region to the Sea of Azof. Pontian\r\nPlateau or Avratinian Ridge are the commonly used but incorrect names\r\nof this plateau group. The first designation might do, but the second\r\ntransfers the name of a little destitute hamlet at the source of the\r\nSbruch to a territory of hundreds of thousands of square miles. We\r\nshall, therefore, select for this plateau group the name Ukrainian\r\nPlateau Group.\r\n\r\nIt forms a compact whole between the Carpathians and the Dnieper and is\r\ndivided into the following individual sections: The Rostoch, between\r\nthe San and Buh Rivers; Volin, between the Boh and the Teterev;\r\nPodolia, between the Dniester and the Boh; the Pocutian—Bessarabian\r\nPlateau, between the Dniester and the Prut; the Dnieper Plateau,\r\nbetween the Boh and the Dnieper. The plateau character continues at the\r\nrapids section of this river on the left bank, where, at some distance,\r\nthe last member of the Ukrainian Plateau Group lies—the Donetz Plateau.\r\n\r\nThe plateau group of the Ukraine is bordered on the north and south by\r\ntwo plain districts. The northern district consists of adjoining\r\nlowlands—Pidlassye, Polissye, and the Dnieper plain—and their\r\nextensions along the Donetz; the southern district is made up of the\r\nlong stretch of the Pontian steppe-plain, which, in the country at the\r\nfoot of the Caucasus, merges into the Caspian desert-steppe.\r\n\r\nBeyond the northern plain district, Ukrainian territory does not\r\nextend, except in the Don region, where it embraces the southern spurs\r\nof the Central Russian Plateau.\r\n\r\nBesides these plateau and plain regions the Ukraine takes in also parts\r\nof three mountain systems of the European continent. The Ukraine is the\r\nonly country of Eastern Europe which extends over into the region of\r\nthe European mountains of plication. Parts of the Carpathians, the\r\nlittle Yaila chain of Crimea, and the western parts of the Caucasus\r\nlie, together with their environs, in Ukrainian territory.\r\n\r\nFrom this general survey of the surface configuration of the Ukraine,\r\nwe can easily see that more than nine-tenths of the surface of this\r\nland is taken up by plains and plateaus. Nine-tenths of the Ukrainians\r\nhave certainly never seen a mountain and do not even know what one\r\nlooks like. Expressive of this circumstance is the fact that in the\r\nwide plateau and plain region of the Ukraine the most insignificant\r\nhills bear the high-sounding name of “mountain.” But, despite this, the\r\nUkraine also has its share in the three mountain systems of Europe—the\r\nCarpathians, the Yaila, and the Caucasus. All three were formed thru\r\nplication of the rock-layers.\r\n\r\nThe vast plication-formed mountain range of the Caucasus, even in the\r\nsmall part belonging to Ukrainian territory, attains an alpine height;\r\nthe scenery of the Yaila along the Crimean Riviera is wonderful, but\r\nthe Carpathians, altho not as lofty as the Caucasus and not of such\r\nscenic beauty as the Yaila, are the dearest to the heart of the\r\nUkrainian. For the Ukrainian nation expanded in the Caucasus only a\r\ncentury ago and has but just reached the Yaila. And the Eastern\r\nCarpathians have for more than a thousand years been a Ukrainian\r\nmountain range.\r\n\r\nStill, hardly one-third of the 1300 km. curve of the Carpathians\r\nbelongs to Ukrainian national territory. Toward the west the\r\nCarpathians are inhabited by Poles and Slovaks; in the east and south\r\nby the Roumanians.\r\n\r\nThe boundary-posts of the Ukrainian territory extend in the west beyond\r\nthe famous defile of Poprad. From the rounded peaks of the mountain\r\ncountry where the last Ukrainian villages lie, one sees rising at a\r\nvery short distance the imposing range of the Tatra; still nearer lie\r\nthe cliffs of the Pienini, famous geologically as well as for their\r\nscenery. In the eastern part of the Carpathian chain, Ukrainian\r\nterritory reaches the Prislop pass, which connects the valleys of the\r\nGolden Bistritz and the Visheva (Visso). To the Ukraine, then, belongs\r\nthe sandstone district of the Carpathians at that point where it is\r\nhighest and most developed. It is called simply the “wooded\r\nCarpathians.”\r\n\r\nThe western part of the sandstone Carpathians which lies within\r\nUkrainian territory is called the Low Beskid. It is also known as\r\nLemkivski Beskid because it is inhabited by the Ukrainian mountain\r\ntribe of the Lemkes. The Low Beskyd extends from the defile of Poprad\r\nto the valleys of the Strviazh River, the Oslava (Lupkiv pass), and the\r\nLaboretz. It is a broad-backed but not a high mountain country. In long\r\nchains, gently undulating mountain ridges stretch from west to east and\r\nsoutheast. Their slopes are gentle; one can easily walk or even ride\r\nup, and numerous wagon-roads and highways lead straight over the crest\r\nor even along the edge of the crest. The peaks are rounded and of\r\nuniform height, except where an occasional gently vaulted mountain top\r\nrises above the low-hill country. Between gently sloping ranges there\r\nextend, in a longitudinal direction, valleys with watersheds and\r\ncommunicating passes. Broad, well-developed defiles separate the range\r\ninto different sections. The Galician-Hungarian dividing-ridge has only\r\nslight gorges of genuine mountain passes.\r\n\r\nThe peaks and high passes of the Lower Beskid are insignificant. Only\r\nin the extreme west, on the Poprad and the Torissa, do the peaks reach\r\na height of 1000 and 1100 m.; further toward the east hardly 700 to 800\r\nm. The important Dukla Pass is hardly 500 m. above sea-level. In the\r\nmiddle of the Beskid mountain country we even see a great longish strip\r\nof lower country (“the Sianok Lowlands”) whose low hills are less than\r\n300 m. high.\r\n\r\nThere is a connection between the insignificant height and soft\r\nlandscape forms of the Low Beskid and the geological construction and\r\nevolution of the mountain range. This mountain country, like the whole\r\nsandstone-region of the Carpathians, is built up of strongly plicate\r\nand compressed Flysch—a series of sandstones, slates, conglomerates,\r\nclays, etc., of the cretacian and tertiary ages. All these species of\r\nrock occur in this region in thin layers and have little power of\r\nresistance; everywhere the basic mountain ridge is covered with a thick\r\ncoat of weathering loam; rock piles are found very seldom. There is\r\nadded the fact that all the sandstone Carpathians of the Ukrainian\r\nterritory have been evened out by the destructive action of water and\r\nair into a more or less perfect plain. Not until the quaternary was the\r\n“obliterated” range raised anew and transformed into a mountain\r\ndistrict by the action of the rivers which were cutting in again.\r\n\r\nThe Low Beskid was once covered with great, mixed forests. Now the once\r\nsplendid virgin forests are completely thinned and all the ill effects\r\nof forest destruction have visited the poor mountain country. The\r\nfertile soil was washed away on the mountain-sides and heaped up with\r\nrubble and mud in the valley bottoms. The tribe of the Lemkos is\r\ntherefore, perhaps, the poorest of all the Ukrainians and is compelled\r\nto seek an existence in distant lands.\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of the Low Beskid the boundaries of the Ukrainian\r\nnation in Hungary reach the northern part of the Hegyalia-Sovari Ridge,\r\nwhich, at this point, is 1100 m. high, and is composed of extinct\r\ntrachyte volcanoes.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the Lupkiv Pass begins the second section of the\r\nUkrainian Carpathians—the High Beskid. It stretches to the southeast as\r\nfar as the valleys of the Stri, Opir and Latoritzia Rivers (Pass of\r\nVerezki).\r\n\r\nThe High Beskid like the Low is composed of a number of parallel,\r\nweakly joined mountain ranges, which run northwest and southeast. The\r\ntype of the Rost Mountains is, therefore, even more clearly marked in\r\nthis part of the sandstone Carpathians than in the preceding. The\r\nmountain crests are gently sloped, the edge of the crests slightly\r\ncurled, the height of the peaks constant, the passes only walled\r\npasses. Toward the southeast, tho, the ridge steadily increases in\r\nheight. The highest peaks are Halich (1335 m.), the beautifully\r\npyramid-shaped rocky Piku (1405 m.) and the massive Polonina ruvna\r\n(1480 m.)\r\n\r\nIn the Flysch of the High Beskid, two species of sandstone attain\r\ngreater power of forming layers and of resisting pressure—the chiefly\r\nupper cretacian Yamna sandstone and the oligocene Magura sandstone. The\r\nformer forms beautiful groups of rocks on peaks and precipices. The\r\ncliffs of Noich, with its traces of a rock castle, are the most famous.\r\n\r\nThe longitudinal valleys are much less developed in the High Beskid\r\nthan in the Low. They are traversed only by smaller brooks. All larger\r\nstreams like the Strviazh, Dniester and Opir, flow thru well-formed\r\npasses. Expansions of valleys (in regions of soft slate) alternate with\r\ncontractions of valleys (in regions of hard sandstone). Most remarkable\r\nare the deeply cut out winding valleys (San, Striy), which offer the\r\nbest proof of the former smoothing down and the later raising of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nBeautiful beech and evergreen forests still cover large parts of the\r\nHigh Beskid. Above the tree-line (1200–1300m) we meet for the first\r\ntime with the characteristic plant-formation of the Polonini (mountain\r\npastures) which yield excellent pasturage for large and small cattle\r\nduring the summer and create the foundation for a primitive dairy\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nAlong the southern foot of the High Beskid, and separated from it by a\r\nchain of longitudinal valleys, a long chain of mountains rises above\r\nthe neighboring Hungarian plain, bearing the name of Vihorlat (the\r\nBurnt Out). The Rivers Uz (Ungh), Latoritzia and Bershava, have cut the\r\nVihorlat into four sections. The range is lower than the Beskyd, since\r\nit is less than 1100 m. high, but it is strongly cut up by deep-gorged\r\nvalleys, and has steep, rocky precipices, bold rocky summits and pretty\r\nlittle mountain lakes. The range, which is covered with thick oak\r\nforests, owes its scenic character to its geological composition. The\r\nVyhorlat is a line of extinct volcanoes, in the old craters of which\r\nthe mountain lakes of the region lie. The firm trachyte lava forms\r\npicturesque rock walls and peaks. East of the Verezki Pass begins a new\r\nmountain section, perhaps the most characteristic one in the sandstone\r\nCarpathians. It extends toward the east as far as the passes of the\r\nPrut and the Black Tyssa (Theiss) and the Yablonitza Pass. This part of\r\nthe sandstone Carpathians bears the name of Gorgani.\r\n\r\nThe uniform mountain walls of the Beskid give way here to shorter\r\nmountain ridges, strongly cut up by cross valleys. The main streams of\r\nthe northern slope, Opir, Limnitzia—the two Bistritzas—flow thru deep,\r\npicturesque passes; still deeper are the valleys of the mountain\r\nstreams which flow into the Theiss, as the Torez, Talabor, etc. It is a\r\nremarkable circumstance that the dividing border ridge is lower than\r\nthe ridges facing it on the north and south, which are broken thru by\r\nmagnificent passes.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the Gorgani ridge also shows traces of the old\r\nleveling-surface and has only small gorges, yet it is much more curled\r\nthan in the Beskid. The ridge often becomes a sharp edge and the\r\ncone-shaped peaks further break its monotony. The height of the peaks\r\nis much greater than in the Beskyd. On the Galician side the Popadia\r\nattains a height of 1740 m.; Doboshanka, 1760 m.; Visoka, 1810 m.;\r\nSivula, 1820 m.; in Hungarian territory the Stoh in the picturesque\r\nBershavi group is 1680 m.; the Blisnitza, in the Svidovez Range, 1890\r\nm., etc.\r\n\r\nThe ridges and peaks of the Gorgani are covered with seas of sandstone\r\nboulders and are, therefore, difficult of access. The light gray Yamna\r\nsandstone, of great resisting power, appears in this mountain section\r\nin very thick layers, and is the cause of the greater height and the\r\nbolder forms which, in places, are suggestive of high mountain ranges.\r\nThe energetic weathering process, aided by the cover of winter snow,\r\nbreaks up the mighty sandstone layers into great rocks, boulders,\r\nfragments and rubble. Deep fissures yawn between moss and\r\nlichen-covered boulders, many boulders rock under the foot of the\r\nwanderer, and many of them, thru caving-in and thru accumulation, have\r\nformed natural chambers and hollows. The rocky ridges, covered with\r\nseas of boulders, are Arshizia, the Gorgan peaks, whence comes the name\r\nof the entire mountain range. The seas of boulders and rubble-stone are\r\ncalled Zekit or Grekhit.\r\n\r\nIn the highest groups of the Gorgani Range (especially in the Svidovez)\r\nare found also distinct traces of the glacial age, glacial excavations\r\nwith small lakes or with swamps that have taken the place of lakes.\r\n\r\nA splendid, only slightly thinned dress of virgin forest covers the\r\nGorgani Chain. The lower forest section is composed of beech, ash and\r\nfir trees, the upper part of pines and stone-pines. The tree limit is\r\nvery irregular and vascillates between 1100 and 1600 m. Mountain\r\npastures are very rare, because of the seas of boulders and\r\nrubble-stone, but there are large and beautiful, tho not easily\r\naccessible, stocks of mountain pines.\r\n\r\nThe last section of the Ukrainian Carpathians is called Chornohora\r\n(Black Mountains). It extends from the Prut and the Black Theiss to the\r\nPrislop Pass; to the valley of the Visheva and of the Golden Bistritza.\r\nIn this wide and long mountain district we find greater morphological\r\nvariety than in the mountain sections hitherto discussed. In the wide\r\nzone of the northern foothills, which separate with a distinct edge\r\nfrom the sub-Carpathian hills and continue into the Bukowina, we find\r\nlow ridges and rounded peaks, as in the High Beskid. Only in places on\r\npeaks and valley sides piles of rock are seen. Then toward the interior\r\nof the range follows the wide vale of Zabie, imbedded in soft slate,\r\nand above it rises the mighty chain of the Chornohora, the only part of\r\nthe sandstone region of the Carpathians which has high mountain\r\nformations. The chain is composed of the hard magura sandstone, rich in\r\nmica. A whole stretch of peaks here attains a height of 2000 m., the\r\nhighest being the Hoverla (2058 m.). Well-formed, partly rocky ribs\r\nbranch off from the main ridge on either side. The rock piles of the\r\nShpitzi, Kisli and Kisi Ulohy, are some of the most imposing rock\r\nformations of the Carpathian sandstone region. Between the rocky ribs,\r\nfinely developed glens lie on both sides of the main ridge of the\r\nChornohora, the beds of the ancient glaciers. Waterfalls dash down the\r\nsteep rock walls in silver streams—of particular interest is the\r\ncascade of the Prut under the Hoverla—and down below lie little crater\r\nlakes reflecting the patches of summer snow on the crater walls. Almost\r\nthree-fourths of the year the Chornohoras are covered with snow. In\r\nsummer the snow almost wholly disappears, and the beautiful carpet of\r\nflowers of the mountain pastures, only occasionally interrupted by dark\r\ngreen reserves of mountain-pine, spreads out over the ridges and peaks\r\nof the Chornohora. Every summer innumerable herds of cattle, small\r\nHutzul horses and sheep are seen here. Then an intensive dairy industry\r\nenlivens the peak regions of the range for three months. The lower\r\nregions are still covered with extensive forests; in lower locations we\r\nfind mixed forests here; in higher altitudes, almost pure stocks of\r\npines.\r\n\r\nStanding on one of the Chornohora peaks, on the Hoverla for instance,\r\nor the Petros or Pip Ivan, we see, in the near southwest, a new and\r\nstrange mountain world. It is the third zone of the Chornohora\r\nMountains, the mountain land of Marmarosh. Situated in the region of\r\nthe headwaters of the Theiss and orographically related to the\r\nChornohora, the mountains of the Marmarosh are of entirely different\r\ngeological composition and have a different morphological appearance.\r\nGneiss and other kinds of crystalline slate, permotriassic and jurassic\r\nconglomerates and limestones, as well as eruptive rock of older and of\r\nmore recent date, lend great geological and morphological variety to\r\nthe Marmarosh Mountains. The high mountain character here is even more\r\nmarked than in the Chornohoras. Rocky peaks, ridges, mountain walls,\r\nnumerous craters, with small glacial lakes, adorn the Marmarosh\r\nmountains, which rise higher than 1900 m.: Pip Ivan, Farko, Mikhalek,\r\nPetros, Troiaga. Toward the southeast the range wanders over into South\r\nBukowina, where its last boundary-posts, the rocky peaks of Yumalen and\r\nRareu really stand on Roumanian ground. And in the south, beyond the\r\nVisheva Valley, which divides the settlements of the Ukrainian Hutzuls\r\nfrom those of the Roumanians, rises the magnificent lofty rampart of\r\nthe Rodna Mountains, with its two peaks of 2300 m., Pietrosu and Ineu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the outside of the Carpathian curve stretches a hill country of\r\nvarying breath, the sub-Carpathian hill-country, in Ukrainian: Pidhirye\r\nor Pidkarpatye. The mountain-edge of the Carpathian, which is at all\r\npoints very distinct, rises steeply over the low-hill country at the\r\nfoot, along an extended line in the neighborhood of the cities of\r\nPeremishl, Sambir, Drohobich, Striy, Kolomia. The Carpathian rivers\r\nleave the mountains by way of funnel-shaped valleys, bordered by\r\nboulder terraces, and spread their alluvial mounds over the low hill\r\ncountry. Wide stretches of meadow accompany the river courses; fields\r\nand woodland lie at a distance. The sub-Carpathian hill-country is\r\nbuilt up of miocene gray clays which, along the edge of the\r\nCarpathians, contain an enormous treasure of petroleum, ozokerite,\r\nkitchen salt and potash salts. Boulders lie on the clay, not only along\r\nthe rivers, but also on the hilltops—traces of old watercourses, which\r\ntransported Carpathian and northern rubble-stone toward the east in the\r\ndirection of the Dniester. The yellowish cover of loam and loess lies\r\nover the whole, and its surface-layer, abounding in vegetable soil, is,\r\nin places, very fertile.\r\n\r\nThe sub-Carpathian hill country reaches to the two sub-Carpathian\r\nplains in the north—the Vistula and the Dniester Plain. Only along the\r\nEuropean main divide a tongue of hill-country projects in the direction\r\nof Lemberg. In the glacial period, watercourses of great volume flowed\r\ndirectly across this hill-country divide, which, as might be expected,\r\nis now completely cleft by the bifurcation of the Vishnia, depositing\r\nconsiderable masses of rubble-stone and sand. Thru destruction of\r\nforests, the sands have become subject to wind action and dreary\r\nlandscapes of sand-dunes have been formed.\r\n\r\nOnly the southeastern reaches of the Vistula Plain, extending along the\r\nSan River to Peremishl are part of Ukrainian territory. The low loam\r\nbags, which lie between sandy and swampy valleys of the San, form the\r\nonly rises of ground in this plain, which borders in the northeast on\r\nthe spurs of the Rostoch.\r\n\r\nThe Dniester Plain extends in a broad ribbon along the river from the\r\nplace where it leaves the mountains to the delta of the Striy. Its\r\nwestern part is a single great swamp region, a one-time large lake. The\r\nrivers flow on flat dams, and when the melting snows come and the rains\r\nof early summer, they overflow their banks and flood the swampy plains\r\nfar and near. In some years the swamp region changes into a lake for\r\ndays and weeks. In the dry season only a few swamp lakes remain, but\r\nthe entire region remains a swamp and produces only a poor sour hay.\r\nSettlements lie only on the high banks of the rivers.\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of the Dniester Plain extends beyond the great\r\nalluvial mounds of the Striy River, and then reaches over into the\r\nbroad valley of the Dniester, which ends in the Podolian Plateau at the\r\npoint where the river enters. The eastern Dniester Plain is not very\r\nswampy, and only in places do ravines, swamps, and old river beds\r\naccompany the river course. For the most part pretty meadows, fields\r\nand woods lie on the thick sub-layer of rubble-stone and river-loam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Carpathians represent a primeval section of Ukrainian ground,\r\nthe mountain ranges of Crimea and the Caucasus were entirely strange to\r\nthe Ukrainians not so very long ago. How many Ukrainian slaves, in the\r\ntime of Tartar oppression, cursed the rocky-wall of the Yaila which\r\nseparated them from their beloved home. How discontented was the\r\nenslaved remainder of the Zaporogs when transported to the Western\r\nCaucasus.\r\n\r\nNow the conditions are quite changed. The great colonizing movement of\r\nthe Ukrainians touched the Yaila as much as twenty years ago, and has\r\nextended the frontiers of the Ukrainian settlements along the outer\r\nmountains of the Caucasus to the Caspian Sea. And the once strange,\r\nhostile mountain-worlds have opened their doors to Ukrainian\r\ncolonization.\r\n\r\nThe Yaila Mountains of Crimea are, in comparison with the Carpathians,\r\na small mountain system hardly 150 km. long and 35 km. wide. They lie\r\nin three parallel ranges, separated by longitudinal valleys, along the\r\nsoutheast shores of the peninsula. The northern declivities of all the\r\nridges are gently sloping, the southern ones steep. The southern main\r\nrange exceeds a height of 1500 m. with its peaks, Chatirdagh,\r\nRoman-chosh, and Demir Kapu. This main ridge, which declines toward the\r\nsea in steep precipices, is flat and rocky on top, strewn with\r\nrock-craters; it bears the name Yaila and serves as a lean mountain\r\npasture. Deep gorges cut the rough surface of the summit and divide it\r\ninto single table mountains.\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Crimea, like the Carpathians, are mountains of\r\nplication. They are composed of Jurassic, chalk, and miocene-layers.\r\nThe large blocks of lime of the Jurassic, which rest on softer slates\r\nand clays, form the main ridge of the mountains. Besides craters, we\r\nfind, in the limestone mountains of the Yaila, impassable furrows\r\n(German Karrenbildungen) and numerous hollows.\r\n\r\nVery picturesque is the magnificent precipitous decline of the main\r\nrange of the Yaila to the sea. Here the entire southern part of the\r\nrange has sunk in great ravines and the resisting power of the eruptive\r\nrocks which appear here has created a coastal mountain landscape of\r\ngreat beauty. Protected by the mountain wall from northerly winds, a\r\nMediterranean flora has been able to develop here at the southern foot\r\nof the range, while beautiful leafy forests partly cover the declines\r\nof the mountains.\r\n\r\nOn the peninsula of Kerch, which forms the eastern extreme of Crimea, a\r\nlow steppe-like hill-country extends seemingly as a prolongation of the\r\nYaila Range. The new tertiary clays are here laid in flat folds, which\r\nare more closely related to the Caucasus. Here, and on the quite\r\nsimilarly formed Taman peninsula, we find many small cone-shaped mud\r\nvolcanoes which emit gases, smoke, and thinly flowing blue-gray mud\r\nfrom their miniature craters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnificent lofty range of the Caucasus forms the boundary-post of\r\nthe Ukraine on the east. Only the western part of the mountain system\r\nlies within Ukrainian territory. We shall, therefore, discuss it quite\r\nbriefly.\r\n\r\nThe Caucasian Mountain system, which is 1100 km. in length, lies like a\r\nhuge wall of rock between Europe and Asia. Most geographers consider\r\nthe Caucasus as part of the latter continent, which is correct in so\r\nfar as these mountains show many characteristics of Asiatic mountain\r\nranges. First of all they are hard to cross, much harder than the\r\nhighest mountains of Europe, the Alps. Along a stretch of 700 km., the\r\nridge of the Caucasus descends only twice to a level of 3000 m. On the\r\nother hand, the Caucasus is not wide—on the average only 150 km.—and at\r\nthe point where the Grusinian army road crosses the range, barely 60\r\nkm. Then, the Caucasus, like many mountain ranges of Asia, stretches in\r\na straight line from the peninsula of Taman to the peninsula of\r\nApsheron, famous for its abundance of petroleum.\r\n\r\nThe Caucasus is a plication-formed mountain range composed of folded\r\ncrystalline and sedimentary rock of varying ages. Along huge ravines,\r\nthe entire southern part of the range has sunk down, so that the\r\nhighest crystalline central zone of the range declines directly and\r\nvery steeply toward the south. The highest Caucasus peaks are old\r\nextinct volcanoes, set over the basic mountains; the Elbrus (5630 m.),\r\nat the source of the Kuban and the Kasbek (5040 m.), at the source of\r\nthe Terek. Proof that the subterranean powers are still active are the\r\nnumerous tectonic earthquakes of Transcaucasia.\r\n\r\nThe main chain of the Caucasus possesses, besides the volcano peaks,\r\nmany rocky granite peaks 4000–5000 m. in height, and, besides these,\r\nhundreds of lower peaks, all of which find their counterparts in the\r\nAlps. The present glaciation of the Caucasus is very considerable,\r\nwhile that of the glacial period was also very extensive and determined\r\nthe present mountain forms of the Caucasus. Only the most beautiful\r\nornament of the one-time glacial landscape is lacking in the\r\nCaucasus—the lakes, which are so abundant in the Alps.\r\n\r\nAll the larger Caucasus rivers rise as milky glacial brooks in the main\r\nrange. Then, by way of deep cross-valleys, they break thru the lower\r\nranges, which face the main ridge in several rows, and are composed of\r\nsedimentary rock formations of jurassic, cretaceous, and old-tertiary\r\nage. Their crests and peaks become constantly lower and more rounded\r\ntoward the north. Beautiful mountain pastures and thick virgin forests,\r\nfull of animals that may be hunted, cover the mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the country at the foot of the Caucasus, a low hill-region is\r\nspread, which consists mainly of new-tertiary layers abounding in\r\npetroleum. At the Ponto-Caspian divide, the hill-district and plateau\r\nof Piatihorsk and Stavropol, which is composed of recent lime\r\nformations, projects from the Caucasus. From a height of 600 m. this\r\nstructure declines slowly in flat hills toward the west, north and east\r\nto the Ponto-Caspian steppe-plain, in which lies the famous Manich\r\nFurrow. The Manich, or rather Calaus River rises like the Kuma in the\r\nPlateau of Stavropol and separates, in the Furrow, into two branches.\r\nThe one flows thru extended Manich lakes toward the northeast into the\r\nDon River, and, incidentally, into the Sea of Azof; the other turns\r\ntoward the south to the Kuma River and the Caspian Sea. But its waters\r\nreach this goal very rarely; the burning sun and the sandy soil of the\r\nCaspian steppe rob the little river of its small supply of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UKRAINIAN PLATEAU COUNTRY\r\n\r\nThe Carpathians, the Yaila and the Caucasus, are immovable\r\nboundary-walls, marking the southern borders of the Ukraine. On its\r\nwide surface there are only these narrow zones of mountain country. All\r\nthe remaining territory of our fatherland is occupied by plateaus and\r\nplains. Upon these the Ukrainian nation has lived since the dawn of\r\nhistory. Not cloud-capped highlands, but level, lightly undulating\r\nplateaus, furrowed by picturesque river valleys and immeasurable\r\nplains, are characteristic of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nBetween the Carpathians and the Ural Mountains there extends an immense\r\nspace which once bore the name of Sarmatian Plain and is now generally\r\ncalled the Russian Tableland, tho the name East European Lowland would\r\nbe geographically the most fitting. In this space, which embraces half\r\nthe surface of Europe, only one group of hills in the Pokutia rises\r\nabove 500 m., and only one small part of the Podolia above 400 m. The\r\nentire remaining space of Eastern Europe, with slight exceptions, keeps\r\nbelow the 300 or even 200 m. level.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of Eastern Europe, the lands over 200 m. high take\r\nup very little room. Like great flat islands, they rise gently from the\r\nspacious cool lowlands. In Central Europe the surface of the high part\r\nof the flat country is relatively the greatest, but these rises of\r\nground are so insignificant and the transitions to the low plain so\r\nimperceptible, that the main features of the surface of this part of\r\nEurope were only discovered in the second half of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\nIn the Ukrainian south of Eastern Europe the character of the ground\r\nelevations is different. They are the highest of all in Eastern Europe\r\nand separate very distinctly, largely by means of steep edges, from the\r\nsurrounding plains. The genuine plateau landscape is the type of\r\nlandscape peculiar to the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian plateau group, the real morphological nucleus of the land\r\nabout which its borderlands are gathered, extends from the\r\nsub-Carpathian country and the Polish Vistula-region to the Sea of Azof\r\nand the Donetz River. It consists of the following plateaus: Rostoche,\r\nPodolia, Pokutye (Bessarabia), Volhynia, Dnieper Plateau and Donetz\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin our survey of the Ukrainian plateaus with the Podolia.\r\nThe Podolian Plateau is the most massive of all the plateaus in the\r\nUkraine, the highest, and the one possessing the most distinctive\r\nfeatures of a heavily cut high plain.\r\n\r\nIf, leaving the Carpathians, we overlook the surrounding country from\r\nthe edge of the mountain range, we observe behind the wide stretch of\r\nthe sub-Carpathian hills and plains, just on the horizon, wide, flat\r\nelevations, which obstruct the horizon in the north. These are the\r\nedges of the Podolian Plateau.\r\n\r\nThe western boundary of Podolia is formed by the wide valley of the\r\nlittle Vereshitza River, a valley covered with swampy meadows and large\r\nponds. On the south and southeast, Podolia is bounded by the valley of\r\nthe Dniester River, which is first wide and then narrows down to a\r\ncañon. Between the lower course of the Dniester and the Boh, the\r\nPodolian Plateau gradually leads into the Pontian Steppe-plain. On the\r\nnorth and northeast, Podolia is bounded by the rocky valley of the Boh\r\nand then by the river divide, which extends toward the west, between\r\nthe basins of the Dniester and Dnieper Rivers. Near its limit begins\r\nthe well-known steep edge which forms the decline of the Podolian\r\nPlateau to the plain of the Buh. From Brody to Lemberg, the northern\r\nboundary of Podolia is very clearly marked by this steep edge.\r\n\r\nDespite its distinct plateau character, Podolia is by no means lacking\r\nin beautiful landscapes. The northern, steep, border of the Plateau\r\noccasionally rises for 200 m. above the swampy Buh plain, and its\r\nheight above sea level is in some places 470 m. The whitish-gray\r\nchalk-marl which forms the basis of this land grade glitters from a\r\ndistance, exposed thru the action of the water, which flows down the\r\nsteep side. The miocene sandstone lying above shows fantastic rock\r\npiles and ravines. Beautiful beech forests are to a great extent still\r\nmaintaining themselves on the steep edge. From a distance, everything\r\nproduces the illusion of a high forest-covered chain of hills. On\r\nclimbing it, however, we see in the south only an unbounded lightly\r\nundulating elevated plain, with flat valleys filling the entire view.\r\n\r\nToward the southwest, too, Podolia declines with a similar steep\r\nborder, but this one is neither so uniform nor so high and picturesque.\r\nThese steep borders owe their origin to a recent uprising, which has\r\naffected the Podolian Plateau, especially in the west, since the\r\nglacial period. To the same cause the picturesque, beautifully wooded,\r\neroded hill-country of the Opilye owes its origin, a section which\r\nextends southeast from Lemberg in the regions of Rohatin and Berezani\r\nto the Dniester, and which, with its peaks, reaches a height of 440 m.\r\nMost remarkable, however, is the long chain of rocky hills which\r\nextends from Brody to the southeast toward Kamenetz Podilski. This\r\nchain of hills, which bears the name of Toutri, is marked on all maps\r\nby the wilfully chosen name of Medobori. The limestone rock, which\r\ncontains a great amount of fossils, forms fantastic crags on the more\r\nthan 400 m. peaks of the hill-chain, which look down upon the land like\r\nold fortresses. The entire chain of hills is a new-tertiary coral and\r\nbriozone reef which, after the withdrawal of the sea, remained behind\r\nas a long rock dyke.\r\n\r\nBeyond this hilly region the entire Podolian Plateau has a flat,\r\nundulating surface. Beginning as far back as the upper Sereth and\r\nSbruch we find typical steppe-plains. The farther southwest, the more\r\nflat, undulating and steppe-like sections do we meet, until finally the\r\nPodolian elevation gradually merges in the Pontian steppe-plain.\r\n\r\nMuch variety and beauty is given to the appearance of the Podolian\r\nlandscape by the valleys of the Dniester tributaries on the left. In\r\ntheir upper parts they are wide and have flat, swampy ground, many\r\nponds and bogs and gentle valley declines. In its further course the\r\nriver begins to cut in more and more deeply, the valley becomes\r\nconstantly narrower and deeper and winds on in regular bends, the\r\nvalley-sides become higher and steeper, bare walls of rock take the\r\nplace of the soft green slopes. We are in a Podolian “yar,” in a\r\nminiature cañon.\r\n\r\nIn the sides of the yars the geologic history of the Podolia is\r\nengraved in imperishable letters. The river has sawed the plateau thru\r\nas tho with a gigantic saw, and has exposed the various layers of\r\nstone. As a rule they lie nearly horizontally above one another.\r\n\r\nThe oldest rock species of Podolia are the granite-gneisses, which were\r\nfolded and disturbed in pre-cambrian times. The lines of the folds and\r\nbreaks stretch principally north to south. Granite composes the rocks\r\nof the Dniester rapids near Yampol and the numerous rapids of the Boh\r\nRiver, in whose rocky vale this primitive rock formation appears\r\ndistinctively. On the granite base, almost horizontally, slightly\r\nturned toward the southwest, lie dark slate and limestone, upper\r\nsilurian at first in West Podolia, then the devonic layers, of which\r\nthe old red sandstone attracts the eye most of all, because of the dark\r\nred coloring which it gives to the steep walls of the Podolian cañons.\r\nThese are followed by chalk layers, and, last of all, by recent\r\ntertiary formation whose gypsums form picturesque groups of rocks on\r\nthe heights of the Yari walls. In the mighty gypsum stores of Podolia\r\nmay be found many a large, beautiful cave, with wonderful alabaster\r\nstalactites.\r\n\r\nAll tributaries on the left side of the Dniester, beginning at the\r\nZolota Lipa, flow into yari-cañons of this sort. The most beautiful and\r\nmagnificent is the cañon of the Dniester, whose walls often exceed a\r\nheight of 200 m. It cuts thru the high plateau in adventurous windings,\r\nevery curve revealing new, beautiful prospects over the high, concave,\r\nsteep edge, torn by ravines, and the gently rising convex banks. In\r\ndeep gorges the yari of the tributaries open into the yar of the main\r\nstream. Between the defiles stretches the flat, hardly undulating\r\nplain. In the summer only endless waving grain-steppes present\r\nthemselves to the view of the traveler, only here and there a little\r\nwood appears on the horizon, or a lone farm. Suddenly the wood seems to\r\nend, the traveler is confronted by a deep, steppe-walled valley, down\r\nthe sides of which climbs the road. And below, on the silvery river,\r\namid the green of the orchards, lies village after village.\r\n\r\nThe further to the east, the more frequent do the yari become, and the\r\nbalkas (gorges) similar to them but smaller; yet these are not so deep\r\nand picturesque. In the regions of Tiraspol Ananiv the entire plateau\r\nsurface is very profusely cut by these defiles. In the district of\r\nAnaniv the balkas take up one-seventh of the entire surface. The\r\nplateau is cut up by these water crevasses into innumerable narrow\r\nfens.\r\n\r\nThe balka, like the yar, owes its existence to the erosive activity of\r\nflowing waters. On the Dniester we see, on both sides of its deep yars,\r\ngreat masses of old river boulders, which lie on the summit of the\r\nplateau beneath the thick cover of loam. They are boulder deposits of\r\nthe pre-glacial Dniester. Later, when the recent raising of the\r\nUkrainian plateau group began, and it occurred with particular force in\r\nthe Podolian Plateau, the rivers cut in, and in the course of thousands\r\nof years formed their present picturesque defiles.\r\n\r\nThe entire surface of the Podolian Plateau is covered with a thick\r\nmantle of loess, which was formed in the desert and steppe period\r\nfollowing the glacial age. In the manner in which the loess is heaped\r\nup, in the symmetry of the river valleys, whose western declivities are\r\nregularly steeper, in the general arrangement and formation of the\r\nvalleys of Podolia, the great influence of winds may be distinctly\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe uppermost loess layer has been transformed thruout Podolia into the\r\nfamous black earth (Chornozem). Hence Podolia has for ages been famous\r\nfor its fertility. “In Podolia,” says an old Ukrainian proverb, “bread\r\ngrows on the hedgeposts and the hedges are of plashed sausages.” On the\r\nother hand, Podolia suffers greatly from lack of forests. The large\r\nareas of forest which still existed in the 16th and 17th Centuries have\r\nnow divided to small woods. The effects of forest destruction were not\r\nslow. Many springs and brooks have dried up, the rivers have\r\nlanguished, so that in particularly dry summers there is often a dearth\r\nof water. On the other hand, after the cutting down of the forests,\r\nbegan the destructive activity of the gorges, which extend after every\r\nstrong rain and are able in a short time to transform a rich\r\nagricultural district into a maze of ravines.\r\n\r\nBetween the Podolian Plateau and the hilly sub-Carpathian country lies\r\nthe Pocutian-Bessarabian Plateau.\r\n\r\nThe far-stretching narrow plateau section which lies between the\r\nvalleys of the Dniester and the Prut is called Pokutye (land in the\r\ncorner) in the west, while in the east the name Bessarabia (properly\r\nBassarabia) is commonly used. In the west the plateau country reaches\r\nthe valleys of the Bistritza and Vorona in the sub-Carpathian region;\r\nin the southeast it passes over into Pontian steppe-plain.\r\n\r\nOn the Dniester one sees almost no difference between the character of\r\nPodolia on the left bank and of Pocutia or Bessarabia on the right. On\r\nboth sides the same valley slopes, composed of the same rock\r\nlayers—except that the one on the right bank is more compact, because\r\nthe Dniester receives only few and small tributaries on this side. Only\r\nat some distance from the course of the Dniester do the peculiarities\r\nof the Pokutian-Bessarabian Plateau appear to the view.\r\n\r\nThe western part of the plateau, which bears the name of Pokutye and\r\nextends to the east as far as the hill-group of Berdo-Horodishche, has\r\na level, very flat, undulating surface. And yet it is a typical\r\nkarstenite country, affected by the existence of great strata of\r\ngypsum. The region has a very great number of funnel-shaped depressions\r\nwhich are called Vertep and are altogether analogous to the Carso\r\ndolomites. They originated thru the dissolving action of the\r\nsubterranean water in the gypsum strata. The funnel walls are always\r\nsteep on one side, gray gypsum rocks rise like walls over the bottom of\r\nthe funnel, which is often occupied by a small lake. Many brooks\r\ndisappear in the karstenite funnels, to continue their course as\r\nsubterranean streams. Nor does Pokutye lack other marks of a karstenite\r\nregion. The action of the subterranean waters has, by dissolving the\r\ngypsum masses, formed large caves, which are famous for their beautiful\r\nstalactites of white alabaster. The best known are the cave of Lokitki,\r\nnear Tovmach, and in the neighboring South Podolia, the caves of Bilche\r\nZolote and the recently discovered magnificent caves of Crivche.\r\n\r\nHowever, the karstenite country of the Pokutye cannot bear comparison\r\nwith the karstenite regions of Krain, Istria and Croatia. Gypsum is not\r\nlimestone, and its strength is insignificant as compared with strength\r\nof the lime-stone in genuine karstenite regions. A genuine karstenite\r\nformation therefore does not exist in Pokutye, and a thick cover of\r\nclay is only in exceptional cases broken by gypsum rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Pokutian Plateau is much lower than the Podolian. Only in isolated\r\nplaces does it attain a height of 370–380 m. and becomes constantly\r\nlower toward the east. But north of Chernivtzi (Czernowitz) it rises to\r\na height which we look for in vain in all the rest of the Ukrainian\r\nplateau group. The wooded hill-group of the Berdo Horodishche here\r\nreaches 515 m., the greatest height above sea level to be found between\r\nthe Carpathians and the Ural. In the east, Berdo Horodishche passes\r\nover into the chain of hills of Khotin, which attains a height of 460\r\nm. and marks the eastern end of the Pocutia. The southeastern long and\r\nwide Bessarabian section of the plateau is divided into far-reaching\r\nnarrow marshes by the flat valleys of the Prut and Reut Rivers. The\r\nPrut-Dniester river divide attains a height of 420 m. (Megura hill) in\r\nthe headwater region of the Reut south of the city of Bilzi. The\r\nsoutheastern part of the Bessarabian plateau consists of very numerous\r\nlow marshes, which lie between flat valleys. The plateau becomes\r\nconstantly lower and flatter and passes imperceptibly over into the\r\nPontian Steppe-plain.\r\n\r\nThe third member of the Ukrainian plateau group is the Rostoche.\r\nLooking from the summit of the castle mountain of Lemberg, famous for\r\nits beautiful prospect, we see, just behind the broad valley of the\r\nPoltva River, a chain of high wooded hills which stretch toward the\r\nnortheast. They form the spurs of the Rostoche.\r\n\r\nThe Rostoche, called also the Lemberg-Lublin Ridge, lies, a profusely\r\ncut, hilly, narrow plateau, which is bounded on the one side by the San\r\nand Vistula Plain, on the other side by the low country of the Buh.\r\nToward the southwest the Rostoche has a steep rim, which, as a matter\r\nof fact, is rather insignificant-looking; toward the east it resolves\r\nitself into parallel hill-ridges, which gradually become lower and\r\nbetween which lie marshy valleys.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of the Rostoche, which merges with the Podolian\r\nPlateau near Lemberg and extends to the broad, sandy and marshy glacial\r\nriver valley of Tanva toward the northwest, is a plateau transformed\r\ninto an erosive hill-country. The highest hills attain a height of 400\r\nm. The river valleys are in general flat; only along the steep borders\r\nof the plateau are they cut deep. The steep western border is very\r\npicturesque, with its deep gorges and loess walls. Many vigorous\r\nsprings appear here, among them the well-known Parashka spring, from\r\nwhich a heavy column of water rises from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe oldest rock layer of the Rostoche is the chalk-marl. Above it lie,\r\nin almost undisturbed horizontal layers, miocene limestone, sandstone,\r\nclay, sand, Diluvial loam, while sand and broken stone with many\r\nboulders, which are of unmistakable northern origin and were\r\ntransported by glaciers and streams of the ice period as far as the\r\nsouthern part of the Rostoche, form a heavy cover everywhere. The\r\nground is not very fertile, sand and marl soil being particularly\r\nwide-spread.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of the Rostoche, beyond the Tanva valley, is a broad,\r\nslightly undulating plateau, which, in its highest part, reaches a\r\nheight of only 340 m. The western edge of the plateau is distinct and\r\nsteep and declines in places 100 m. to the low country of the Vistula.\r\nToward the north the plateau surface declines very gradually and merges\r\nalmost imperceptibly into the plain of the Pidlassye. The river\r\nvalleys, as those of the Buh, Vepr, are broad, flat and marshy.\r\n\r\nThe geological constitution of the northern Rostoche is almost entirely\r\nsimilar to that of the southern part. Its soil cover, too, is not very\r\nfertile, and only great woods have survived, especially in the\r\ndistricts of the old morainic sand and loam. Only in the neighborhood\r\nof the Pidlassye does the soil become more fertile. For the\r\nconfiguration of surface of the Rostoche, the recent post-glacial\r\nraising of the ground has also been of great significance, altho here\r\nit was not nearly so intensive as in Podolia.\r\n\r\nThe Volhynian Plateau extends over a broad space between the Buh in the\r\nwest and the Teterev in the east, between the swampy plain of the\r\nPolissye in the north and the Dniester-Dnieper watershed and the upper\r\nBoh valley in the south. The Volhynian Plateau does not possess the\r\ncompactness of the Podolian or Rostoche Plateau. The swampy lowland of\r\nthe Polissye extends along the rivers into the heart of Volhynia,\r\nthereby dividing its plateau country into several sections of different\r\nsize. Likewise, the inner structure and geological constitution of\r\nVolhynia is variable. Western Volhynia, situated between the Buh and\r\nHorin Rivers, has a sub-layer of chalk marl, which is capped in places\r\nby layers of clay and sandstone and limestone of recent tertiary date.\r\nEastern Volhynia lies entirely in the region of the primeval Ukrainian\r\nHorst, whose plicate granite-gneiss sub-layer is covered by old\r\ntertiary deposits. In this tectonically disturbed region we meet with\r\ntraces of early volcanic action. Near Berestovetz, Horoshki, etc.,\r\nspecies of eruptive rock appear as signs of radical disturbances of the\r\nearth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe surface soil of Volhynia is black soil only in the south. Beyond\r\nthat we find here sandy soil, white earth and loamy soil, as signs of a\r\none-time glacial covering and the action of fluvio-glacial waters. Many\r\nregions of loamy ground are rich in vegetable soil and not without\r\nconsiderable fertility.\r\n\r\nThe lowest part of the Volhynian Plateau is the western part, which\r\nlies between the broad, marshy, flat valleys of the Buh and the Stir.\r\nThe slightly undulating, almost level plateau surface, which declines\r\nimperceptibly toward the Polissye, here just attains a height of 200\r\nm., while the next section, between the Stir and the Horin is the\r\nhighest part of Volhynia. As an extension of the above-mentioned\r\nnorthern edge of Podolia, the Kremianetz-Ostroh hill-country intrudes\r\nbetween the two rivers. Over 400 m. high, near the city of Kremianetz,\r\nit declines toward the north, a steep section torn by gorges and\r\nravines. Near Dubno, the plateau is cut into a picturesque hill country\r\nwith a maximum height of 340 m. The hills of Volhynia have steep, often\r\nrocky declines and flattened rocky peaks. North of Rivne and Lutzk they\r\nfinally begin to be lower and more rounded, then they dwindle to a flat\r\nbillowy tract of land, until, at the borders of the Polissye, we see\r\nonly an almost perfect plain.\r\n\r\nBetween the Horin and Sluch Rivers, the Volhynian Plateau becomes more\r\nuniform. Its surface is flat, and broad valleys of the rivers which\r\nflow toward the east, forming numerous ponds, part it slightly. Only in\r\nthe south is a height of more than 300 m. reached; in the north, where\r\nthe granite sub-layer appears everywhere, especially in river valleys,\r\nbarely 200 m.\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of the Volhynian Plateau extends, at first, as a\r\nnarrow plateau zone between the valleys of the Boh and the Teterev on\r\none side and of the Sluch on the other. Then the plateau spreads out\r\nlike a fan toward the north. At the source of the Boh and the Sluch,\r\nthe plateau reaches a height of 370 m.; at the sources of the Teterev,\r\n340 m. Here the surface is level, except that here and there low,\r\ngently-rounded hills arise. In the broad, northern part, the Volhynian\r\nPlateau becomes much lower and finally separates into individual\r\nplateau islands, as, for example, near Novhorod-Volinsky, Zitomir,\r\nOvruch, which rise gently from the marshy lowlands.\r\n\r\nThe valleys of the Volhynian rivers, broad, flat, with gentle slopes\r\nand marshy bottoms, differentiate the Volhynian landscape most strongly\r\nfrom the Podolian. The Volhynian landscape presents a view of flat,\r\nwooded hills, slowly flowing streams between flat banks, marshes and\r\nmarshy meadows, sandy ground—all signs of the proximity of the\r\nPolissye.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper Plateau has the outlines of a longish, irregular polygon.\r\nOn the northwest it is bounded by the rocky valley of the Teterev, on\r\nthe southwest by the Boh River, on the south and southwest by the\r\nPontian steppe-plain, on the northeast by the Dnieper River.\r\n\r\nThis great space, however, does not constitute a uniform plateau. The\r\nbroad river valleys and broad depressions which traverse the plateau\r\nhave parted it into several sections. Only the uniform sub-layer and\r\nthe geologic character, as well as the uniform appearance of the\r\nlandscape, determine the natural unity of the region.\r\n\r\nThe sub-layer of the Dnieper Plateau is made up of the primitive\r\ngranite-gneiss clod of the Ukrainian horst. The granite-gneiss\r\nformations were folded in the pre-cambrian period. The folds and\r\nquarries stretch principally from north to south, and appear very\r\ndistinctly near Zitomir and Korsun, and at the rapids of the Dnieper.\r\nThe mesozoic layers also, which lie close to the granite-horst, are\r\nfolded at Trekhtimiriv. The tertiary layers, which form a thin cover\r\nover the granite, lie mostly in undisturbed horizontal lines. Only\r\nalong the right, steep bank of the Dnieper we see them folded and\r\nbroken thru by quarries. In the neighborhood of the Shevchenko barrow\r\nthey appear most distinctly.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of eruptive rock in the south of the plateau, appearing\r\nin mound-shaped flat hills, is, however, connected only with the old\r\ndisturbances in the horst.\r\n\r\nThis species of rock of the Dnieper Plateau appears almost solely in\r\nthe declivities of the valleys and balkas. Otherwise it is covered\r\neverywhere by an immense mantle of loam, loess, and chornozyom. The\r\nglacial deposits, whose southern boundary passes through Zhitomir,\r\nTarashcha, Chihirin, and Kreminchuk, present, in the territory of the\r\nDnieper Plateau, examples of genuine fluvio-glacial moraine, as well as\r\nsands of no great depth, and in rather erratic distribution.\r\n\r\nThe configuration of surface of the Dnieper Plateau is varied enough.\r\nThe greatest height (300 m.) is reached south of Berdichiv. Toward the\r\neast and southeast the plateau becomes constantly lower. This lowering,\r\nhowever, does not proceed regularly, different sections of the plateau\r\npresenting different conditions in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe section projecting furthest toward the west to the Sob and Ross\r\nRivers is a level, slightly divided plateau, with a maximum height of\r\n300 m. The tributaries of the Teterev, Irpen and Ross flow slowly in\r\nflat valleys thru whole rows of ponds. Where they enter the plain they\r\nfinally have steep granite banks and rocky beds. The plateau section\r\nbetween the Sob and Ross Rivers in the west and the Siniukha and Huili\r\nTikich in the east has more valleys. The river valleys and balkas are\r\ndeeper, their sides rockier, and thru them the plateau is transformed\r\nin places into chains and groups of flat hills. But this plateau\r\nsection is lower than the preceding one, attaining only 260 m. Still\r\nlower is the section between the Siniukha and the Inhuletz. It attains\r\na height of only 240 m. and is very even. The granite sub-layer appears\r\nhere even in the level steppe; the valleys and balkas are cut deep with\r\nrocky bottoms and rocky slopes.\r\n\r\nBesides these three sections, the Dnieper plateau embraces two long\r\nstrips of plateau which stretch along the right bank of the Dnieper.\r\nThe one is surrounded by the Dnieper, Irpen, and Ross Rivers, the other\r\nstretches from the source of the Tiasmin to the rapids of the Dnieper.\r\nThe height of these strips of plateau is negligible, the highest points\r\nattaining just 190 m. near Kiev, 240 m. between Trekhtimiriv and Kaniv,\r\n250 m. near Chihirin, and barely 180 m. at the first of the rapids. The\r\nsteep declivity with which the plateau strips descend to the Dnieper\r\nplain emphasize the antithesis between plateau and plain in this region\r\nvery markedly.\r\n\r\nThe difference in level surpasses 100 m. near Kiev and Katerinoslav and\r\n150 m. near the Shevchenko barrow, not far from Kaniv. The declivity of\r\nthe right bank of the Dnieper is much torn by gorges, and everywhere we\r\nsee picturesque rock piles. The steep bank appears, especially to a\r\nplain-dweller, like a chain of mountains and is even called “the\r\nmountains of the Dnieper.” The idea of a “mountain bank” of the\r\nDnieper, therefore, need not be rejected outright. The aspect of Kiev\r\nand the Shevchenko barrow is one of the most beautiful in the entire\r\nUkraine.\r\n\r\nOn ascending this “mountain chain,” however, which appears so imposing\r\nfrom the left bank of the river, and looking toward the west, we find\r\nbefore us only a slightly undulating plateau surface, with rounded\r\ndome-shaped hills and deep valleys, belonging to the right-hand\r\ntributaries of the Dnieper.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the landscape of the Dnieper Plateau is, consequently,\r\ndifferent from that of the Volhynian or Podolian. The lightly\r\nundulating plateau, gradually becoming flatter toward the east and\r\nsouth and broken up only near the river valleys into flat dome-shaped\r\nhills; the valleys of the rivers, wide, not deep, and yet with rocky\r\nriver beds and rocky slopes, with loess gorges and walls; the mighty\r\nDnieper with its picturesque mountain shores; the never-ending grain\r\nsteppes crossed by little woods, mohilas and long, extended old walls\r\nof rock—this is the landscape view of the old Kiev country, the heart\r\nof the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper Plateau becomes constantly lower toward the southeast,\r\nwithout, however, losing its original landscape nature in the least.\r\nNear the Dnieper rapids we see, quite distinctly, that the\r\nmiocene-covered sub-layer of granite of the Ukrainian plateau group\r\nstretches straight across the river and is the cause of its rapids. But\r\nthe differences in level at that point are no longer different from the\r\nvariations in a plain. In the region of the source of the Samara and\r\nalong the Donetz the land finally rises above the 200 m. level again.\r\nWe are now in the Donetz Plateau.\r\n\r\nAs near as Isium we confront the first boundary post of the plateau in\r\nthe steep chalk rocks of Mt. Kremianetz on the Donetz River. Further\r\ndown we see the picturesque rocks of the famous monastery of “the Holy\r\nHills.” All these are parts of the northern verge of the plateau, which\r\nis its limit on the north. Near Slavianoserbsk and Luhansk this\r\npicturesque border reaches a height of 70 m. The course of the Donetz\r\nalso forms the eastern boundary; the southern boundary is formed by the\r\nsmall strip of the Pontian Plain on the shore of the Sea of Azof; the\r\nwestern border is denoted by the plain on the left bank of the Dnieper.\r\n\r\nThe Donetz Plateau stretches in a long flat ridge from N. W. W. to S.\r\nE. E., and extends a flat side-ridge to either side. The longer one\r\ngoes southward, almost as far as Mariupol, the other northward to\r\nBakhmut. The surface of the plateau is very level and declines very\r\nflatly toward all sides. Only light billows of land traverse the steppe\r\nsurface, which is strewn with countless tumuli. In the south these\r\nhills often have a core of granite. The river valleys have steep, altho\r\nnot high slopes. They divide the uniform surface of the heights but\r\nslightly. From the surface configuration one could never guess that at\r\nthis point there was once a mountain range which fell victim to the\r\nexogenous forces of the earth’s water and air blanket. Only an\r\ninsignificant part of the surface of the Donetz Plateau lies more than\r\n300 m. high; the highest point, Tovsta Mohila, barely reaching 370 m.\r\n\r\nIn its inner structure it is entirely different from all other parts of\r\nthe Ukrainian group of plateaus. The entire south and west of the\r\nplateau is composed of folded granite-gneiss, of the Azof part of the\r\nhorst, capped by a thin tertiary layer, and in many places (especially\r\nbetween Volnovakha and Kalmius) broken thru by eruptive rock\r\nformations. Next to these, in the north and south of the plateau, lie\r\nlimestone, slate, clay and sandstone formations of devonian, carbonic,\r\npermian, jurassic and cretaceous age, folded and broken thru by\r\nravines. Over this leveled basic range lie the horizontal tertiary\r\nlayers. The great development of the coal-containing carbon layers\r\ngives to the monotonous, only recently bared steppe elevation of the\r\nDonetz Plateau, great significance for the industrial life of all\r\nEastern Europe. The coal-fields of the Donetz Plateau, 23,000 km. in\r\nsize, are the richest and most important coal region of the present\r\nRussian Empire. Thanks to these “black diamonds,” a forest of factory\r\nchimneys (sparsely sown as yet, to be sure) has sprung up within the\r\nmost recent past in the black steppe, where the anthracite and pit-coal\r\ncollieries furnish the desired nourishment. Besides this, the permian\r\nlayers of the Donetz Plateau hold great deposits of rock-salt. Here,\r\ntoo, lie the only quicksilver mines of the Russian Empire in Europe.\r\nRich copper deposits are being exploited here, besides which we must\r\nmention the occurrence of zinc, silver, lead, and even gold in this\r\nDonetz region, which has not yet been sufficiently explored by the\r\nmining prospector.\r\n\r\nThe Donetz Plateau forms the easternmost member of the Ukrainian\r\nplateau group, which constantly narrows toward the east. Outside of\r\nthis, the group rises only at the southernmost spurs of the Central\r\nRussian Plateau above the 200 m. level. These regions of the Ukraine,\r\nhowever, we may safely discuss in our description of the Dnieper Plain,\r\nfor the transition from this plain to the Central Russian elevation is\r\nso imperceptible and gradual, the plateau character so undecided, that\r\neven from the scientific morphological point of view, one can hardly\r\nfind any difference between the plain landscape and the neighboring\r\ncombined elevated surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UKRAINIAN PLAIN COUNTRY\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian plateau group, which passes thru the Ukraine in its\r\nentire length is hemmed in on both sides by two plain regions. Without\r\na break they accompany the extended plateau groups in the north and\r\nsouth, uniting finally on the left bank of the Don and the country\r\nbelow the Caucasus. The northern plain district accompanies the\r\nnorthern decline of the Ukrainian horst, concealing a tectonically\r\ndisturbed substratum; the southern district accompanies the northern\r\nborder of the Black Sea and parts the broken chain of plicate mountains\r\nfrom the plateau group of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe northern plain district of the Ukraine joins directly on to the\r\nPolish lowlands, and, indirectly, to the North German lowland.\r\n\r\nThe first section of the northern plain district is called Pidlassye\r\n(Podlakhia, land on the Polish border). Its northern boundary consists\r\nof the southern limits of the White Russian Plateau; the western\r\nboundary of the flat elevations near Sidlez and Bilsk; on the south the\r\nplain borders on the spurs of the Rostoche; in the east the boundary is\r\nthe Buh-Pripet divide, which is only 170 m. high. The surface of the\r\nPidlassye is very even, only slightly undulating in places on the north\r\nand south borders. The river valleys are very broad and flat. Only the\r\ngreat forest (the well-known Biloveza forest lies here) and the\r\nwater-courses bring variety into the monotonous country. The main\r\nstream of the Pidlassye, the Buh, as well as its tributaries have the\r\ncharacter of genuine lowland rivers. They flow thru their over-great\r\nvalleys in great turns, divide into many arms, and form innumerable old\r\nriver beds. Besides these we find, in southern Pidlassye, a large\r\nnumber of lakes and many swamps and moors which mark the sites of\r\nformer lakes.\r\n\r\nThe chalk and tertiary substratum appears only in very few places, the\r\nrest being covered everywhere by sand and loam, which include boulders\r\nand rubble of Finnic-Scandinavian origin. These are traces of the great\r\n(second) glacial period of Northern Europe, which covered the entire\r\nregion of the Pidlassye with glacial ice. The lakes are morain-lakes.\r\nThe ice of the glacial period did not reach Pidlassye. At that time a\r\nbroad primeval river valley formed here as an extension of the primeval\r\nVistula river valley. In this valley the water from the melting glacier\r\nflowed off to the east toward the lowland of the Polissye.\r\n\r\nThe Polissye (woodland) is one of the most remarkable lands of Eastern\r\nEurope. Only a low (170 m.) and very flat divide, which is crossed\r\nwithout difficulty by the Dnieper-Buh ship canal, separates the\r\nPolissye from the Pidlassye. In the north the White Russian Plateau\r\napproaches, in the south the Volhynian, in the east the Polissye\r\nextends beyond the Dnieper to the spurs of the Central Russian Plateau.\r\nThe region thus bounded forms an immense flat trough, in the vertical\r\naxis of which the Pripet River flows. The bottom of this trough is very\r\nflat and lies at a height of 120–150 m. Only in places do we find\r\nalmost imperceptible rises of ground. The substratum of the Polissye is\r\ncomposed of chalk marl with numerous holes made by springs (vikno =\r\nwindow), while in the east oligocene formations also appear. But this\r\nsubstratum is seen very seldom, all the rest of the Polissye being\r\ncovered with diluvial sands and great swamps. The sands take in all the\r\nelevated places and form wandering or wood-covered dunes. These sandy\r\nrises of ground, together with the elevated banks of some of the\r\nrivers, afford the only sites for human abodes. All the remaining land\r\nis marshy wood, genuine forest swamps, bog or moor. The Pripet with its\r\ntributaries, the Stokhod, Stir, Hornin, Ubort, Uz (on the right) and\r\nthe Pina, Yassiolda, Sluch, and Ptich (on the left), comprises the\r\nwater system of the Polissye. All these rivers flow very slowly and\r\ndeposit the mud which they bring from the plateau regions surrounding\r\nthe Polissye along their courses. By this means they raise their beds\r\nand their banks more and more, so that all these Polissian rivers flow\r\nupon flat dams. At the time of high water the rivers overflow their\r\nbanks and flood the entire lowland far and near. At the time of the\r\nmelting of snows in the spring, or of the strong showers in the early\r\nsummer, the entire Polissye is transformed into an immense lake, above\r\nwhose surface only the flooded forests and the settled sandy elevations\r\nof ground are visible. The spring flood lasts from two to three months,\r\nthe summer floods the same length of time, for the water flows off very\r\nslowly because of the slight decline. On the highways and railroads all\r\ntraffic is blocked and certain places in the Polissye may be reached\r\nonly by water. During the flood period the rivers have often sought new\r\nbeds, and this explains the frequency of old river beds and river\r\nbranches, which are peculiar to all the Polissian river courses. And,\r\nas reminders of the floods, innumerable pools and marsh lakes remain\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThese periodic floods are the main cause of the continuance of the\r\nPolissian swamps. We can find two main types of marshes in the\r\nPolissye. In the west and north of the region, great peat moors, with\r\npine woods, predominate; in the south and east treeless marsh meadows,\r\novergrown with willow brush. These are called hala. Many fictions are\r\ntold by the inhabitants of the Polissye about the swamps and small\r\nmarsh lakes being bottomless. For a long time it was even believed that\r\nthe swamps lay lower than the normal surface of the rivers. But exact\r\nmeasurements have proved these “fairy tales” to be false and have shown\r\nthat the swamps of the Polissye are not deep and lie at a higher level\r\nthan the rivers. Since 1873 the Russian government has been working to\r\ndrain the swamps and reclaim them for civilization. Up to 1898, 6000\r\nkilometers of canals are supposed to have been dug and 32,000 square\r\nkilometers of ground made usable.\r\n\r\nThe glacial period was of great importance for the surface\r\nconfiguration of the Polissye. Apart from the traces of the main\r\nglacial period, which are met with frequently in southern Polissye, it\r\nwas the third glacial period that was of marked significance. The water\r\nfrom the Baltic glacier flowed off thru the region of the present\r\nPolissye and formed a large lake with the Dnieper as its outlet. The\r\ndeposits of this lake are to be found especially in the south of the\r\nPolissye basin. The lake was then gradually filled in, the northern and\r\nwestern tributaries bringing more sand, the southern ones mud. At the\r\nsame time the Pripet River cut in more deeply, and was, therefore,\r\nconstantly more able to carry the waters of the Polissye to the Dnieper\r\nRiver. Swamps have taken the place of the lake and have gradually\r\ncovered the entire land. The many smaller lakes of the region (the\r\nlargest of them are Vihonivske Ozero and Knias) are the only remains\r\nand proofs of the one-time great lake. Only at the time of high water\r\ndoes the Polissye recall the memory of former times.\r\n\r\nDreary is the Polissian landscape. The dark forest in the deep-bottomed\r\nswamps alternate with the open marsh-meadow covered with pools; with\r\ngliding flow the many-armed rivers traverse the gloomy country. On\r\nyellow-white sand-dunes stand a few log-houses amid wretched little\r\nfields and poor meadows, corduroy and brush roads stretching for miles\r\nconnect small, very sparsely scattered human settlements.\r\n\r\nThe Polissye Plain also extends to the left bank of the Dnieper, and\r\nthere imperceptibly passes over into a comparatively narrow lowland\r\ndistrict which stretches along the main river of the Ukraine. This is\r\nthe third member of the series of plains of the Ukraine—the Dnieper\r\nPlain. It extends toward the southeast as far as the region of the\r\nrapids (porohi) of the Dnieper and rises slowly toward the northeast,\r\npassing over into the Central Russian Plateau. The transition takes\r\nplace so imperceptibly that the difference in the nature of the country\r\nonly becomes apparent at the furthest bounds of Ukrainian territory,\r\nwhich practically lie in the southern spurs of the Central Russian\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper Plain is quite level only along the river itself. Every\r\nyear a strip of the plain, in places 10 km. wide, is flooded by the\r\nDnieper River, wherefore it is full of old river beds and swamps, on\r\nthe Desna and near Cherkassy, where the lowland, too, enters upon the\r\nright Dnieper bank, and also of sand-dunes. Near Chernihiv and Uizin\r\nthe landscape is quite Polissian and the name Polissye, too, is often\r\nused here to denote the region. Toward the southeast the Polissian\r\ncharacter begins to gradually disappear. Black earth takes the place of\r\nthe sandy soil, the forest mantle becomes constantly thinner, and the\r\nflat, undulating steppe-plain, with its innumerable barrows and\r\nplate-shaped depressions of ground, where, in springtime, small steppe\r\nlakes glisten in the sunlight, increases very rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe river valleys, along which the Dnieper Plain intrudes far into the\r\nCentral Russian Plateau, are very wide valley slopes on the right, and\r\nflat slopes on the left side. Sand, swamps and forest terraces cover\r\nthe flat valley bottoms, which are flooded every spring.\r\n\r\nAt the porohs of the Dnieper the country rises much higher than at\r\nPereyaslav or Kreminchuk, where the Dnieper Plain rises barely 50 m.\r\nabove sea-level. At the porohs the landscape on both sides is that of a\r\nlow rock-plateau. The picturesque rocks of the Dnieper banks, the\r\nrapids and ledges of rock in the river bed, everywhere remind us that\r\nhere the Ukrainian Horst is crossed by the main stream of the Ukraine.\r\nNot until we get down to the Zaporoze (land below the rapids) do we\r\nfind the genuine lowland character again—in the Pontian Steppe-plain.\r\n\r\nThe transition of the Dnieper Plain to the southern spurs of the\r\nCentral Russian Plateau is marked only by the rising of the valley\r\nslopes of the tributaries of the Dnieper in this region. Beyond that,\r\nthe surface of the high bog, lying between the rivers, remains as flat\r\nand level as on the Dnieper and below the 200 m. level. Moreover, the\r\nspurs of the Central Russian elevation nowhere within Ukrainian\r\nterritory attain the level of 300 m. The spur between the Dnieper and\r\nthe Desna barely reaches a height of 230–240 m.; near the high Desna\r\nbank, the spur between the Desna and the Sem barely 260 m. About the\r\nsources of the Sem, Psiol and Donetz, the country attains a summit\r\nheight of 280 m.; between the upper Donetz and Don only 250–260 m. From\r\nthese highest regions the country declines imperceptibly but steadily\r\ntoward the southwest, south and southeast.\r\n\r\nThe general nature of the land in the region of the southern spur of\r\nthe Central Russian Plateau is entirely analogous to that of the\r\nneighboring Dnieper Plain, except that the river valleys are more\r\ndeeply cut. The right valley-side descends to the river in a steep\r\nslope, furrowed by water rifts. The broad, flat valley bottom is\r\noccupied by river branches and old river beds, marshes and marsh\r\nmeadows, sand areas or dunes. The left bank rises very gently, and we\r\nat last come upon the level, or at most slightly undulating surface of\r\nthe water-shed, between two rivers. It, in turn, declines suddenly to\r\nthe neighboring river and the succession of land-forms begins anew.\r\nThis monotony of landscape reminds one of the neighboring Great Russia.\r\nThe only variety is afforded here by the details of landscape, which\r\nappear most numerous in this region of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThese are rain water-rifts (in Ukrainian balka, provallia, yaruha). In\r\nthis, and often in other plateau and plain lands of the Ukraine, they\r\nbecome a terrible scourge. The heavy mantle of black soil, loess and\r\nloam favors the formation of water-rifts as well as the loose chalk and\r\nold tertiary strata (marl, sand, clay). The strenuous cutting down of\r\nforest in the past century has given the final impulse to the formation\r\nof such water clefts. In the loose soil, no longer held together by the\r\nforests, the water-rifts grow and spread after every heavy rain with\r\nterrible speed, and may, in a few years, reduce a wealthy farmer to the\r\nbeggar’s staff by transforming his most profitable black-soil fields\r\ninto a maze of deep, dry ravines. Only a national re-stocking of the\r\nforests could bring the land relief. Especially in the neighborhood of\r\nthe high precipitous banks of the rivers, the water-rifts work their\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nThe glacial age had no particular significance for the surface\r\nconfiguration of the Dnieper Plain and the adjacent plateau spurs. Only\r\nin the north Chernihov country we find real traces of the glacier. The\r\nlarge peninsulas which the southern limit of the glacial boulders forms\r\nalong the course of the Dnieper and the Don are by no means to be\r\nregarded as traces of two great glacial tongues. The sand and loam\r\nmasses, with enclosed glacial boulders, which are found in the region\r\nof these peninsulas, are of fluvio-glacial origin, and were deposited\r\nby melted ice from the glacier on its way to the Black Sea. The\r\nnorthern limit of the black soil region is not in the least affected by\r\nthese problematic glacial peninsulas.\r\n\r\nAfter the glacial period, however, movements of the earth took place in\r\nthe entire Ukrainian plateau group. It rose considerably, and the\r\nerosive action of the rivers began. At the point where the axis of the\r\nUkrainian horst cuts the Dnieper, we find this rise of ground also in\r\nthe Dnieper Plateau. The rapids of the Dnieper were formed at that\r\ntime, and, up to the present, the giant river has not succeeded in\r\nleveling its falls.\r\n\r\nThat tectonic disturbances are not unknown to the Dnieper Plain we\r\nlearn from the occurrence of volcanic rock and displacement of the\r\nstrata near Isachki, not far from the city of Lokhvitzia, and on Mount\r\nPivikha, north of Kreminchuk. It seems that along the northeast border\r\nof the Ukrainian horst a greatly disturbed area is hidden beneath more\r\nrecent flat-piled rock layers. Great disturbances of the magnetic force\r\nof the earth seem to indicate the same.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper Plain forms the last member in the northern plain district\r\nof the Ukraine. The southern plain district which extends along the\r\nnorthern banks of the Black Sea, from the delta of the Danube into the\r\nKuban region, has since ancient times borne the accepted name of the\r\nPontian Steppe-plain. Its old Ukrainian name is simply nis (lowland) or\r\ndike pole (wild field). The steppe-land and the river district, to this\r\nday, bear the famous name of Zaporoze (land below the rapids).\r\n\r\nThe Pontian steppe-plain is bounded on the north by the spurs of the\r\nBessarabian, Podolian, Dnieper and Donetz Plateaus. On the south, by\r\nthe sea-shore and the country at the foot of the Yaila Mountains, in\r\nCrimea. Past the Danube deltas the steppe-plain merges into the exactly\r\nsimilar steppe-plain on the Kuban.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the steppe-plain is exceptionally flat, slightly\r\nundulating only at the northern border, where the transition to the\r\nsouthern spurs of the Ukrainian plateau group proceeds imperceptibly.\r\nInnumerable barrows (mohyla) are as characteristic of the landscape of\r\nthe Pontian Steppe-plain as the flat plate-shaped depressions of the\r\nground, with small temporary lakes, the swampy flat valleys and the\r\nsmall salt marshes with their peculiar vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe many balkas, which divide the steppe-plain into innumerable low\r\nplateaus, do not affect the grand uniformity of the steppe landscape\r\nvery much. As in the neighboring plateaus, they are cut in deep, but do\r\nnot become visible to the traveler until he comes directly upon them.\r\nThe pliocene steppe-lime which predominates in the entire steppe-plain,\r\ncovers the sarmatian and Mediterranean strata, and reveals the\r\ncrystalline substratum only in the west of the Dnieper in the\r\nneighborhood of the Dnieper Plateau, and forms rocky cornices on the\r\nslopes of the balkas. Lesser tectonic disturbances, in the shape of\r\nanticlinals and synclinals, have affected these youngest tertiary\r\nformations also. They are covered by a mantle of loess and black earth,\r\nwhich becomes constantly thinner toward the south. The typical\r\nchornozyom gives way, south of the parallel of Kherson, to the brown,\r\nalso very fertile steppe-soil, which is accompanied in long stretches,\r\nhowever, by the saline earth. To the east of the Dnieper, at the\r\nsouthern spurs of the Donetz Plateau, the crystalline substratum also\r\nappears to a great extent, in banks of rock, in the midst of the\r\nsteppe-plain.\r\n\r\nOnly along the large streams of the steppe country does the nature of\r\nthe land change. Their valleys are broad and swampy, covered by the\r\nso-called plavni. Interminable thickets of sedge and seeds, marsh\r\nforest and meadows, together with innumerable river branches, old river\r\nbeds, and small lakes, make up a beautiful, fresh, verdant country in\r\nthe midst of the boundless steppe, whose vernal dress, resplendent with\r\nblossoms, turns yellow and blackish-brown in summer and fall, from the\r\nfierce glow of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREAMS AND RIVERS OF THE UKRAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian rivers are genuinely typical of Eastern Europe. The great\r\nuniformity of the surface configuration of the Ukraine is responsible\r\nfor the lack of that variety in its own river system which\r\ncharacterizes the waters of Western and Central Europe. But the great\r\nextent of the land does cause the Ukraine to have mountain, plateau and\r\nlowland streams, so that it does not attain the degree of uniformity in\r\nhydrographic conditions of Russia proper.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian river system concentrates in the Black Sea. From\r\nnorthwest, north and east, the rivers of the Ukraine tend toward its\r\nsea. Besides, the western boundary lines of the Ukraine lie on the\r\nBaltic slope. There, in Podlakhia, in the Kholmshchina, on the San\r\nRiver and in the Lemko country, the Ukrainian people has had its seats\r\nsince the dawn of its history. In most recent times Ukrainian\r\ncolonization has gained also parts of the Caspian slope on the Kuma and\r\nTerek Rivers. But the region drained by the Black Sea surpasses both\r\nthe other regions so much in extent and in the size of its rivers, that\r\nthe Baltic and Caspian region of the Ukraine dwindle in comparison.\r\nNature has, therefore, turned the Ukrainian nation toward the south and\r\nsoutheast to the Black Sea. But, at the same time, she has not denied\r\nthe Ukraine a convenient connection with the north and south of the\r\nglobe. The main European river divide is, perhaps, nowhere so flat and\r\nso easy to cross as in Ukrainian territory. From the Dniester to the\r\nSan (bifurcation of the Vishnia creek near Rudki), from the Pripet to\r\nthe Buh and Niemen the passages are easy. Since ancient times portages\r\nhave existed here, and in modern times the Pripet has been connected\r\nwith the Buh and the Niemen by means of canals (King’s Canal and\r\nOginski Canal) which, however, are at present entirely antiquated and\r\nalmost useless. Besides, the widely branched water system of the\r\nDnieper outside the Ukraine affords easy passage to the Dvina (Beresina\r\nCanal), Volga and Neva, in White Russian territory. Over these\r\nwaterways and the portages lying between them the old path of the\r\nNorthmen led from Scandinavia to Constantinople. This most important\r\naspect of the Ukrainian water system promises at some future time to\r\nbear rich fruit, if the recently-formed plan to build a waterway for\r\nnavigation on a large scale, from the Baltic to the Black Sea,\r\nutilizing the course of the Dnieper, should become a reality.\r\n\r\nThe Baltic watercourses of the Ukraine flow into the Vistula. Several\r\nlarge Carpathian tributaries originate in Ukrainian territory. Here the\r\nrapid Poprad carries the melted snow of the Tatra to the Dunayetz. The\r\nsource of the Visloka also lies in the Ukrainian Lemko country. The\r\nlast and largest Carpathian tributary of the Vistula belongs, in\r\nthree-fourths of its extent, to Ukrainian territory, namely, the\r\nnavigable San. It receives from the Carpathians the Vislok on the left\r\nand the Vihor on the right. The other tributaries of the San on the\r\nleft side, the Vishnia, Sklo, Lubachivka and Tanva, come from the\r\nsub-Carpathian country and the Rostoche Plateau.\r\n\r\nAll the Carpathian tributaries of the Vistula have only at their\r\nsources the character of mountain streams, with swift currents, in\r\nrocky river beds, lined by banks of water-worn material. Even in the\r\nmountains their valleys become wide, covered with banks of pebbles,\r\nsand and loam, and overgrown with willow-brush, and their falls\r\ninsignificant. In the sub-Carpathian country the banks become low and\r\nsandy, the stream slow, and the water-level is very unsteady, owing to\r\nthe cutting down of forests in the country of the source. In spring,\r\nwhen the snow melts in the mountains, and at the time of the early\r\nsummer rains, there are terrible floods; in dry summers the rivers\r\ndwindle to almost insignificant proportions.\r\n\r\nFrom the Rostoche the Vepr, navigable from Krasnostav down, flows thru\r\na broad, marshy valley, into the Vistula. The northern declivity of the\r\nPodolian Plateau sends its largest river, the Buh, navigable from Sokal\r\non, down to the Vistula. This river is really a genuine lowland river.\r\nIts valley is wide and flat, the river winds with its muddy bed thru\r\nforest marshes, thickets of reeds and willow brush, now parting into a\r\ndozen branches, now flowing in a wide bed, past fresh, green meadows\r\nand dark forests. The same lowland character is a common quality of the\r\nleft-hand tributaries of the Buh, the Poltva, Rata, Solokia, Krna and\r\nof the Luha on the right hand. The Mukhavetz, Lisna, Nurez and Narva,\r\non the other hand, are typical woodland streams, which roll their great\r\nmass of water thru the forests of Podlakhia.\r\n\r\nThe Pontian Rivers of the Ukraine belong to the six great regions\r\ndrained respectively by the Danube, Dniester, Boh, Don and Kuban.\r\n\r\nOf the great region drained by the Danube, only the Carpathian country\r\nof the sources of the Theiss, Sereth, and Prut lie within Ukrainian\r\nboundaries. The Theiss is formed by the junction of two source-rivers\r\nnear the Svidovez and the Chornohora, and collects all the rivers of\r\nthe Ukrainian country belonging to Hungary—the Visheva and Isa on the\r\nleft, the Torez, Talabor, Velika Rika, Bershava and Bodrochka, which\r\nconsists of five source-rivers (the Latoritzia, Uz, Laboretz, Tepla and\r\nOndava). All these rivers of the Hungarian-Ukrainian mountain country\r\nbreak their difficult way in deep, picturesque passes, thru\r\nforest-covered mountain chains. Innumerable rafts carry the trunks of\r\nthe fallen Carpathian giants into the treeless plains of Hungary. Here,\r\ntoo, the rivers suddenly lose their mountain character; their currents\r\nbecome sluggish, their waters turbid, their banks swampy.\r\n\r\nOf the Sereth and its tributaries, the Sochava and Moldava, only the\r\nsources belong to Ukrainian national territory. On the other hand, a\r\nconsiderable part of the Prut country lies within it. The Prut River\r\nrises at the Hoverla, where it forms a beautiful waterfall along the\r\ncrater walls. Then it flows in a picturesque defile toward the north,\r\nforms another waterfall at Yaremche, then immediately leaves the\r\nmountains, uniting in the sub-Carpathian hill-country with the roaring\r\nCheremosh, which also rises in two source-rivers on the slopes of the\r\nBlack Mountains and flows in a deeply-cut meandering valley thru the\r\nbeautiful Hutzul country. In the sub-Carpathian country the Prut has a\r\nwide, flat valley, taken up in places by marsh meadows. The river winds\r\ndown the wide valley in countless twists, forms side branches and old\r\nriver beds, and reaches the Danube in the midst of liman-like lakes and\r\nbogs, not far from the swampy delta. Outside of the mountains, the Prut\r\nreceives only insignificant tributaries of small volume. Between the\r\nDanube and the Dniester we see only a few miserable little steppe\r\nrivers, emptying into salty or bracken liman lakes (e.g., the Yalpukh\r\nand the Kunduk Rivers).\r\n\r\nThe important Dniester River attains a length of over 1300 km., and\r\npossesses the greatest variety of distinct sections of river of all the\r\nUkrainian streams. It originates in the High Beskid, near the village\r\nof Vovche, as a very energetic, wild creek. In a defile it advances\r\ninto the sub-Carpathian hill-country, where it has deposited great\r\nmasses of rubble. The mountain stream changes rapidly into a lowland\r\nstream and forms great swamps in the Dniester Plain, which, in\r\nhigh-water time, are converted into large river lakes. From the left\r\nbank, the Dniester here receives the muddy Vereshitza (from the\r\nRostoche), which forms many ponds, from Western Podolia, the Hnila\r\nLipa. All the remaining tributaries of this section of the Dnieper come\r\nfrom the Carpathians, on the left the Strviazh (Strivihor), on the\r\nright the Bistritza, the mighty meandering river Striy with the Opir,\r\nand the Svicha (with the Misunka). All these rivers are mountain\r\nstreams, flow in beautiful defiles, and deposit great masses of rubble\r\non the verge of the Carpathians. Beginning at the delta of the Svicha,\r\nthe Dniester Plain becomes a wide, flat-bottomed valley, in which the\r\nriver flows along in great bends and receives the Limnitzia and both\r\nthe Bistritzas from the Carpathians. Near Nizniv the banks approach\r\neach other very closely and the Dniester enters a yar (cañon), not\r\nleaving its steep sides until near Tiraspol. The Podolian tributaries\r\nof the Dniester on the left side, the Zolota Lipa, Stripa, Sereth,\r\nZbruch, Smotrich, Ushitza, Murakhva, Yahorlik, roll their turbid waters\r\nin similar cañons toward the Dniester. The Bessarabian tributaries, on\r\nthe contrary, have wide, swampy valleys. All these plateau rivers are\r\nslight in volume of water, altho some of them attain considerable\r\nlength. Only in the spring, when the snow-blanket melts, do their\r\nwaters overflow the banks. In summer the water-level becomes very low,\r\nand the water of the early summer showers is stored up in the many\r\nponds, which are found in large numbers, in the country about the\r\nsources of these rivers. All these plateau rivers are not even\r\nnavigable for rafts; even the little fishers’ boat can hardly find its\r\nway along the muddy shoals.\r\n\r\nIn its cañons the Dniester River assumes all the characteristics of a\r\nplateau river. Its waters generally take up the entire bottom of the\r\ncañon, leaving very little space for the abodes of men. The incline of\r\nthe river is not uniform, but constitutes a series of slight steps.\r\nSections with rapid currents alternate with quiet depths. The small\r\nbrooks which come down the short lateral gorges of the Dniester cañons\r\nbring great masses of loose stones and rubble into the river bed, as a\r\nresult of the reckless destruction of forests, and build constantly\r\ngrowing cones of rubble, which the river must remove slowly and\r\nlaboriously. They also form dangerous shoals and hinder the development\r\nof navigation on the Dniester. The river also forms regular rapids,\r\nnear Yampil, where a layer of granite stretches clear across the river.\r\nFor this reason the Dniester, tho navigable along a stretch of almost\r\n800 km., has not become an important waterway. The navigation of the\r\nDniester, which becomes more active from Khotin on, is now on the wane.\r\nEight hundred years ago sea vessels were still able to reach the old\r\nUkrainian royal city of Halich.\r\n\r\nThe floods of the Dniester are famous. In the spring, when the snows\r\nmelt in the Carpathians, the Dniester Plain is converted into a great\r\nriver-lake. The Carpathian tributaries bring the main stream so much\r\nwater, that it cannot easily flow off thru the narrow cañon, and so,\r\nfloods the whole wide Dniester Valley for weeks. Then there is high\r\nwater even in the cañon of the Dniester, but it has little scope.\r\n\r\nNear Tiraspol, the Dniester Valley widens out again. Swampy plavni\r\nwilds extend on both sides of the river. In a beautiful, rapidly\r\ngrowing delta, the Dniester empties into its liman, which it is slowly\r\nfilling in with its precipitates. Two narrow outlets (hirló) break thru\r\nthe bar of the liman and connect it with the sea.\r\n\r\nBetween the Dniester and the Boh, not one river finally empties into\r\nthe sea. Even the largest rivers of the region, the Little and Big\r\nKuyalnik and the Tilihul end their courses in limans, which are\r\nentirely closed off by bars. The valleys of these coastal rivers are\r\nnarrow, becoming wider at last, when they are about to enter the\r\nlimans. The current is always slow and the water often evaporates\r\ncompletely in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Boh, falsely named the Southern Bug, is a real plateau river. It\r\nrises in the village of Kupil, near the source of the Sbruch, on the\r\nAustrian border, and flows as a typical Podolian mud-streamlet, in a\r\nflat valley, covered with ponds and swamps. But, beginning at Mezibiz,\r\nits bed becomes rocky, the valley slopes become high and keep\r\napproaching each other. The Boh Valley gradually becomes a cañon-like\r\n“yar,” altho it is at no point so deep as the Dniester Valley. The\r\ngranite-gneiss formations of the Ukrainian horst appear here as\r\npicturesque shore rocks and slopes along the river and form innumerable\r\nrapids (as, for example, Constantinivka) in the river bed. Stony beds\r\nand narrow, rocky valleys are also found in the most important\r\ntributaries of the Boh—the Sob, Siniukha, Inhul on the left; the Kodima\r\nand Chichiclea on the right. All of them have little water, and in dry\r\nsummers only a chain of ponds marks the valley road of the river. The\r\nmain stream, too, has not much water, being unfit for navigation even\r\nin the time of the spring floods. Only the last 130 kilometers of its\r\ncourse, from Vosnesensk down, are navigable. At the entrance of the\r\nInhul the Boh begins to widen considerably, the current becomes slow,\r\nand the depth at Mikolaiv sufficiently great to enable smaller sea\r\nvessels to reach its harbor. Slowly widening, the river gradually turns\r\ninto the Buh liman, which has the winding outline of a river and unites\r\nwith the great liman of the Dnieper. The entire length of the Boh is\r\nover 750 kilometers.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the main river of the Ukraine, the majestic Dnieper. To\r\nthe Ukrainian people the Dnieper bears the same significance as the\r\n“Matushka Volga” to the Russians, the Vistula to the Poles, and the\r\nRhine to the Germans. The Dnieper is the sacred river of the Ukraine.\r\nLike a divinity it was honored by the old Polans, the founders of the\r\nancient Ukrainian state of Kiev; Slavutitza was the name given it by\r\nthe Ukrainians of the monarchy. It was esteemed as a father and\r\nprovider by the brave Zaporog Cossacks, the champions of Ukrainian\r\nliberty. For many centuries the Dnieper has played an important part in\r\nthe folk-lore and literature of the Ukraine, in traditions and\r\nfairy-stories and folk-tales and in thousands of folk-songs; since\r\nancient times it has been sung by all Ukrainian poets, from the unknown\r\nbard of the epic of Ihor, to the greatest of all Ukrainian poets, Taras\r\nShevchenko, and so on, down to the youngest generation of the poets of\r\nthe Ukraine. To them all, the Dnieper is the symbol of the Ukraine, of\r\nits life, and of its past. Not without cause did Shevchenko ask to be\r\nburied on the mountain shore of the Dnieper, “that I may see the\r\nendless plains and the Dnieper and the crags of its banks and hear the\r\nrushing of the Rushing One.” For no one is able to repeat the\r\nimpressions which fill the soul of every Ukrainian when he looks down\r\nfrom this beautiful observation point of Shevchenko’s grave upon the\r\nmajestic river below. How many thoughts, then, arise about the\r\nglorious, and yet so unspeakably sad, past of the Ukraine, about its\r\nmiserable present and the great future toward which the nation tends,\r\namid great difficulties, as does the Dnieper toward the Black Sea over\r\nthe porohs. And we do not wonder that the Dnieper has become the\r\nnational sanctuary of the Ukraine. With this river are connected all\r\nthe important events of the historical life of the Ukraine. The Dnieper\r\nwas the father of the ancient Ukrainian empire of Kiev; by way of the\r\nDnieper a higher culture made its way into the Ukraine; on the Dnieper\r\nthe Ukrainian Cossack element developed, which, after centuries of\r\nsubjugation, gave the Ukrainians a new government. The Dnieper River\r\nhas, since hoary antiquity, been the most important channel of\r\nintercourse between the North and the South of Eastern Europe; it has\r\nbeen the means of connecting the Ukraine with the sea and the cultural\r\nrealm of Southern Europe. Its present importance, despite the low grade\r\nof culture in Eastern Europe, and despite Russian mismanagement, is\r\ngreat, and is growing rapidly. And if in the future the river is made\r\naccessible to sea-going vessels and becomes a road for large-scale\r\nnavigation, its significance may become almost incalculable.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper is the third largest river in Europe, after the Volga and\r\nthe Danube. The length of its course is more than 2100 km. The region\r\nit drains includes 527,000 sq. km., not much less than the whole of\r\nFrance. Among the streams of the globe the Dnieper ranks thirty-second.\r\n\r\nIf the Dniester possesses some of the properties of a Central European\r\nriver, namely, mountainous country at its source and many mountain\r\ntributaries; if the Boh is a genuine plateau river; the Dnieper, on the\r\nother hand, is the real type of a river in Eastern Europe. It rises in\r\nWhite Russia near the village of Clozove. A little swamp, which was\r\nformerly a small lake, situated at a height of 256 m., forms the source\r\nof the river. Because of this small height of the source, the Dnieper\r\nhas, as, in fact, all the Eastern European rivers have, a very\r\ninsignificant incline and an average speed of current of 0.4 m. per\r\nsecond. The source of the Dnieper lies near the sources of the Dvina\r\nand the Volga, as well as the source streams of the Neva.\r\n\r\nNear its source the Dnieper is a small, muddy streamlet, which seeks\r\nits way southward in a flat valley, three miles wide, between swamps\r\nand moors. But quickly its volume increases, and, as near the source as\r\nDorogobuz, the river becomes navigable for smaller vessels. Here it\r\nsuddenly turns to the west, both valley slopes, but especially the left\r\none, become higher and steeper, the valley narrows down to ½ km. But\r\nafter a short stretch it becomes wide and swampy again at Smolensk. The\r\ndepth of the river is very irregular, the pools (plessa) attaining a\r\ndepth of 5 meters, the rapids often less than ½ meter. From Smolensk to\r\nOrsha the Dnieper Valley again becomes hardly 1 kilometer wide, between\r\nhigh banks. On the left bank picturesque, rocky precipices appear. At\r\nOrsha the Dnieper turns to the south, retaining this direction as far\r\nas Kiev. Down to Shclov the Dnieper Valley remains narrow, with steep\r\nslopes, then it widens slowly but steadily. The depth of the river\r\nreaches 10 meters, but many shoals, great morain boulders and broken\r\nsandstone make navigation difficult. Below Mogilev the spurs of the\r\nWhite Russian and Central Russian plateaus withdraw from the Dnieper\r\nand show only on the left side. The river reaches the low plain of the\r\nPolissye and flows in majestic turns thru swamps and meadows which are\r\ndotted with old river beds. In this section of its course the Dnieper\r\nreceives the Druch and the voluminous, navigable Beresina on the right,\r\nand the navigable Soz on the left. The Dnieper receives an especially\r\ngreat amount of water from the Beresina. River navigation is doubled\r\nbelow its entrance, mainly because of innumerable rafts which are\r\ntraveling to the treeless South Ukraine and the Black Sea from the\r\nforests of White Russia.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of the Soz numerous low islands appear in the bed of the\r\nDnieper. The river divides into numerous branches. The entire trough\r\nlying between the Dnieper and the Pripet is a labyrinth of river\r\nbranches, lakes, old river beds, swamps and fens. Thru the Pripet the\r\nvolume of the Dnieper River increases twofold, and very seldom flows\r\nalong in a single bed.\r\n\r\nThe tributaries on the right side, the Teterev and the Irpen, bring the\r\nDnieper the first remembrances of the Ukrainian plateau country, and\r\nsoon its spurs appear on the right river bank. The Dnieper presses\r\nagainst this bank and forms the picturesque precipices above which\r\nglisten the gilded domes of the ancient churches of Kiev. Here the\r\nDnieper receives the largest of its tributaries on the left, the\r\nnavigable Desna. Thus the formation of the Dnieper River is completed,\r\nits source-rivers, the Pripet, Beresina, the upper Dnieper, the Desna\r\nand the Soz have united to build a majestic stream. Its normal average\r\nwidth is 600–850 meters near Kiev. During the spring floods, however,\r\nthe width of the river exceeds 10 km.; from the high, right bank one\r\ncan barely see the woods of the left. All the islands, sand-banks,\r\nswamps, meadows, river branches and old river beds disappear beneath an\r\ninterminable mass of yellowish water, rolling slowly toward the south.\r\nDeep into the valleys of the tributary streams the high-water enters,\r\nand receding, leaves behind a layer of fertile river mud. Not without\r\nreason did Herodotus compare the Dnieper with the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe floods generally occur but once a year—in the spring, when the\r\nsnows melt. In this respect the Dnieper differs from the Dniester and\r\nis similar to all the other rivers of Eastern Europe. In the early\r\nsummer, at the time of the greatest precipitation in the Dnieper\r\ncountry, small floods occur only occasionally, because the rain-water\r\nis stored up in the many swamps and moors of the upper Dnieper country.\r\nThe spring high-water originates in the great masses of snow, which\r\nremain lying all thru winter, melting and flowing off all at once in\r\nthe spring. After an ice-drift lasting 5–12 days, the high-water comes\r\nand lasts a month and a half. It attains its highest level in the\r\nmiddle of April; at this time the water stands at 3.2 meters above\r\nnormal at Mogilev, 2.2. meters at Kiev, 2.6 meters at Kreminchuk, 2\r\nmeters at Kherson, 0.3 meters at the delta. The spring floods are at\r\npresent becoming greater and more irregular, consequently more\r\ndangerous, too, than they have been previously. The progressive\r\ndestruction of forests has contributed most to this condition.\r\n\r\nFrom Kiev down, the Dnieper River turns in a flat curve to the\r\nsoutheast and retains this direction as far as Katerinoslav. The right\r\nbank remains steadily high, torn by gorges and crowned with rock\r\nformations, with numerous niches, which betray former places of contact\r\nof the river bends. The view, defended especially by Russian scholars,\r\nthat the mountain bank of the Dnieper, like that of all other Eastern\r\nEuropean rivers, originated thru the influence of the rotation of the\r\nearth (Baer’s Law), notably does not apply to the Dnieper, for the\r\nplain on the left very distinctly crosses over to the right shore at\r\nthree places; at the mouth of the Stuhna below Kiev, between the mouth\r\nof the Ross and Cherkassi, and north of Chihirin. Recent movements of\r\nthe crust of the earth, by elevating the Dnieper Plateau in huge\r\nsections, prepared the ground for the mountainous shores; the resulting\r\nsteep declivities were attacked and transformed by the river current,\r\naided by an effective simultaneous action of the winds.\r\n\r\nThe left bank of the river is very flat, taken up by swamps, lakes, old\r\nriver beds and wooded fens. Great wildernesses of reeds cover the\r\nswampy banks of the numerous river arms. Great masses of sand brought\r\nby the tributaries on the left side are thrown up by the steppe winds\r\nand from dune landscapes in various places.\r\n\r\nThe tributaries of the Dnieper River in this section are of far less\r\nimportance than the above mentioned northern ones. From the right side\r\nthe river receives the plateau streams Stuhna, Ross and Tiasmin, from\r\nthe left the Trubez, the Supo, the Sula with the Udai, the Psiol with\r\nthe Khorol, and Holtva, Vorskla and Orel. All these rivers increase the\r\nvolume of the main stream only to a slight degree. The width of the\r\nriver at the point where it flows along in a single bed is regularly 1\r\nkm. on the average; at the narrowest part, to be sure, only 150 meters.\r\nWhere the river branches off into several forks, however, the complete\r\nwidth, even at the time of low-water, is more than 4 km., at high-water\r\nover 8 km. The depth of the river, too, is very changeable. The\r\ntributaries on the left side bring great masses of sand to the main\r\nriver bed, forming great banks of sand, which slowly move downward and\r\ncause great changeability of the depth. Over such banks of sand the\r\ndepth of the river is hardly 1½ meters, but attains a depth of 12\r\nmeters where the river flows in a narrow bed.\r\n\r\nBetween Kiev and Kreminchuk, the majestic character of the Dnieper\r\nRiver is most apparent. The slight incline here causes a current of\r\nonly one-third the speed of the current of the Volga. With an\r\nimpressive calm the waters of the Dnieper flow along; it seems as tho\r\nthe mirror-like mass of water were motionless. But soon, above the\r\nmouth of the Psiol, the speed of the current is suddenly tripled, so\r\nthat the steamboats must exert their entire force in the up-stream\r\ntrip. The low left bank begins slowly to rise; the river valley, up to\r\nthis point, wide almost beyond reach of the eye, becomes narrow, the\r\nriver forks and islands gradually disappear, and at the mouth of the\r\nSamara both banks approach the stream with steep precipices. The\r\ndirection of the river becomes southerly and the section begins where\r\nthe Dnieper breaks thru the granite ledge of the Ukrainian horst, the\r\nfamous section of its rapids.\r\n\r\nHere the Dnieper assumes all the characteristics of a plateau river.\r\nThe river valley becomes so narrow that at high-water the river spreads\r\nover the entire valley bottom. The settlements take refuge on the\r\nheights of the steep bank. The granite-gneiss sub-layer appears in\r\nsteep precipices and high picturesque rock formations on the valley\r\nslopes. We are confronted with the same cañon-like valley on the\r\nDnieper, then, as on the Dniester in the Podolian Plateau. Yet there\r\nare certain fundamental differences. The river valley is at most 100\r\nmeters deep, and the granite slopes do not form compact valley sides\r\nsuch as we see in the yars of the Dniester. At every moment the steep\r\ndecline is broken by numerous gorges, picturesque foothills; and\r\njutting cliffs lend to the river landscape of the Dnieper Valley, at\r\nthis point, a variety unknown in the yar of the Dniester.\r\n\r\nThe section of the Dnieper River from the mouth of the Samara to Veliki\r\nLuh, at the mouth of the Konca, forms a river country which is the only\r\none of its kind in Eastern Europe. It is the section of the Dnieper\r\nrapids. The post-tertiary elevation of the Ukrainian horst, at this\r\npoint, has forced the river to dig its bed into the hard granite and\r\ngneiss rocks. Despite great masses of water, the river has not\r\nsucceeded in equalizing its incline. For this reason, we find in its\r\nbed innumerable rocky islands, ledges of rock, separate cliffs and\r\ngreat boulders. In a wild, roaring torrent, the current beats against\r\nthese obstacles, creating deep pools and dangerous vortices. But not at\r\nall places was the river destined to saw thru the obstacles in its way.\r\nAt many points solid ledges of rock lie right across the river. Its\r\nmass of water falls down over these granite steps in immense\r\nfoam-wreathed billows and seethes about innumerable boulders, remains\r\nof already parted ledges. The dull roaring and rumbling can be heard,\r\neven by day, for several miles. These are the rapids of the Dnieper—the\r\n“porohi” and “zabori.”\r\n\r\nThe porohi are not real waterfalls or cataracts; the incline of the\r\nriver in this section is 35 meters for a stretch of 75 km., and is,\r\ntherefore, too slight for regular falls. The greatest incline attained\r\nwithin this stretch of river is 6%. Therefore, only the individual\r\nbranches of water between boulders form small falls, while the main\r\nchannel only shoots along down-stream in a long, foam-covered streak,\r\nover the inclined surface of the ledges. In summer, the depth above the\r\nrock ledges is barely 1½ meters, while in the spring even the highest\r\nreefs of the rapids disappear beneath the masses of the high-water.\r\n\r\nStill, the rapids of the Dnieper are even now a great hindrance to\r\nnavigation. Within the porohi section, steamboat navigation is\r\naltogether impossible, and the smaller rowboats or sailboats can risk\r\nit only during the spring floods, and then only the down-trip. Only the\r\nrafts can pass thru the porohi at low-water time, altho with great\r\ndanger. The up-stream trip is almost impossible, even in the smallest\r\nvessel, altho, at one time, everyone who desired to join the Zaporog\r\nCossacks was required to undertake this daring enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Russian government has attempted, indeed, to make the rapids of the\r\nriver navigable, and has caused a navigable canal to be formed at each\r\nfall, thru blasting of the rock ledges. But these canals have been\r\nplanned in so impractical and even faulty a manner that the river\r\npilots (lotzmani) still use the old “Cossack paths” to a great extent\r\n(the Cosachi khody) to bring river boats and rafts thru the porohi.\r\n\r\nThe width of the river in the rapids section remains unchanged—1 to 1¾\r\nkilometers. Only at its exit from the porohi, at the so-called Wolf’s\r\nThroat (Vovche horlo), the river narrows down to 160 meters. The quiet\r\nsections between separate rapids are usually very wide and as much as\r\n30 meters deep.\r\n\r\nOf genuine rapids (porohi), according to the pilots, who are direct\r\ndescendants of the Zaporog Cossacks, there are nine; of the larger\r\nsabori (ledges of rock which do not obstruct the entire width of the\r\nriver), six. The first rapids below Katerinoslav are the Kaidac rapids\r\n(Kaidazki porih), with four ledges of rock. Then follow the Yazeva\r\nSebora, the Little Sursky porih, with two ledges, the dangerous\r\nLokhanski porih with three ledges, and the Strilcha Sabora, with the\r\ngreat rocks of Strilcha skela and Kamin Bohatir. The next rapids,\r\nSvonez and the far-sounding Tiahinska Sabora, allow vessels easy\r\npassage, but after passing thru the Dnieper the pilot must exert all\r\nhis strength. Even from the Svonez rapids on, one can hear the terrible\r\nroaring and rumbling of the largest of the porohi, the Did\r\n(grandfather) or Nenassitetz (insatiable). Masses of white foam cover\r\nit completely, the water shoots down over the twelve ledges of rock\r\nwith the speed of an arrow. The vessel groans and creaks, but flies\r\nthru the porih in three minutes, if it can only escape the dangerous\r\nrock of Krutko or the terrible whirlpool of Peklo (the Hell). Or it may\r\nhappen that the ship is dashed to pieces in the Voronova Sabora, which\r\nis full of dangerous reefs.\r\n\r\nAfter the Did and the insignificant Kriva Sabora, comes the Vnuk\r\n(grandchild) or Vovnih, whose four ledges, covered with great billows\r\nand masses of foam, holds many hidden dangers for the sailor. But\r\n“after overcoming the Grandfather and the Grandchild, don’t go to\r\nsleep, for the Awakener will wake you”—meaning the next following Porih\r\nBudilo (Awakener) which also is dangerous for ships. We then come past\r\nthe Tavolzanska Sabora, where the beautiful crag (Snieva skela) rises,\r\nto the next to the last porih, Lishni (the Dispensable), with two\r\ninsignificant edges of rock, which offer but slight dangers. The last\r\nporih, however, which bears the name of Vilni (free) or Hadiuchi\r\n(serpent falls), is very dangerous for ships and rafts, for the channel\r\nwinds in serpentine twists thru the six ledges, and the pilot must\r\nexercise all his skill in order to steer the ship entrusted to him\r\nsafely thru the dangerous channel. After this follows the narrow (160\r\nm.) “Wolf’s-Throat” (Vovche horlo), with three great rocks; the small\r\nJavlena Sabora, three dangerous “Robber Rocks” (Kameni Rosbiyniki), and\r\ntwo granite precipices, Stovli (Pillars), and we come into the Zaporog\r\ncountry (Zaporoze).\r\n\r\nHere the Dnieper valley widens and numerous islands appear in the\r\nstream. The upper ones, for example, Khortizia and Tomakivka, which\r\nwere once the site of the first Zaporog Sich, are high, rocky, and\r\novergrown with forest. Further south the steep left-hand valley slope\r\nrecedes far from the river and the so-called Veliki Luh begins. It is a\r\nlabyrinth of flat forest and reed-covered alluvial islands, river\r\nbranches, old river beds, lakes and swamps. Here were located the\r\nhunting and fishing grounds of the Zaporog Cossacks; here was their\r\ndwelling place, wonderfully fortified by nature and surrounded by an\r\ninaccessible wilderness of forests and waters, and the center of their\r\nmilitary state; of the century-old oaks of the Veliki Luh, the Zaporogs\r\nbuilt their ships, in order to pay their daring visits to the lord of\r\nIslam in his own capital. But the glorious days are past, the warlike\r\nlife and activity has disappeared, and strange colonists, whom the\r\nRussian Government has sent here to settle, now occupy the ground on\r\nwhich the second Ukrainian state originated.\r\n\r\nFrom the many-branched mouth of the Konka (also named Kinska voda) the\r\nDnieper River turns toward the southwest, which direction it retains\r\nuntil it disembogues into the sea. From this point on, the river\r\nnowhere flows in a single bed; an enormous number of side arms branch\r\noff from the main arm or unite with it. The broad river valley, whose\r\nright bank continues to be high and rocky for a time, is taken up by\r\nthe plavni formation and winds like a broad band of freshly growing\r\nverdure thru the steppe, which stretches out dry and golden-brown in\r\nthe hot midsummer. After receiving, as its last tributary, the\r\nsteppe-river Inhuletz, it empties with nine arms into its liman, below\r\nKherson. Of these arms only two are navigable for larger vessels, and\r\nthe immense Dnieper liman is at most only 6 meters deep. The river\r\nbrings down great masses of sand and mud, and fills up its liman so\r\nrapidly that strenuous dredging is necessary, in order to make it\r\npossible for small sea-vessels to reach the harbor of Kherson.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper River brings the Black Sea, on the average, 2000 cu. m. of\r\nwater per second. It is navigable, even for large river boats, along a\r\nstretch of 1900 km. The ice-cover lasts 100 days at Kiev; 80 days in\r\nthe lower part of its course.\r\n\r\nThe tributaries of the Dnieper are very numerous and important; their\r\ntotal length is over 13,000 km. Of those on the right, the Pripet River\r\nis the most important. It gathers in all the waters of the Polissye and\r\nis the typical river of that district. Its length exceeds 650 km.\r\nRising in the northern spurs of the Volhynian Plateau, very close to\r\nthe course of the Buh, it immediately reaches the Polissian Plain and\r\nbecomes a navigable river over 50 m. wide and about 6 m. deep. In the\r\nmain axis of the Polissian basin the Pripet turns eastward and becomes\r\nabout 100 m. wide. The incline of the river is very slight, the number\r\nof turns and river arms enormous. Between swampy woods and moors the\r\nriver forms labyrinths of delicate, intricate waterways and stagnant\r\npools. Near Mosir, where the river turns to the southeast, its width\r\nreaches 450 m., its depth 10 m. Of quite the same type are the\r\ntributaries of the Pripet: the Turia, Stokhod, Stir with the Ikva, the\r\nHorin with the Sluch, the Ubort and the Uz on the right; the Pina,\r\nYassiolda, Sluch and Ptich on the left. All of them are navigable along\r\ngreat stretches. The remaining right-hand tributaries of the Dnieper,\r\nthe Teterev and the Irpen, have the Polissian character only near their\r\nmouth, otherwise they are purely plateau rivers with rocky beds. The\r\nTeterev is able to transport rafts of logs, while the other rivers of\r\nthe Dnieper Plateau, as for example, the Ross (altho greater than the\r\nTeterev) and the Tiasmin, are entirely unfit for navigation, as a\r\nresult of their rocky beds and their small volume in summer. The last\r\nlarge Dnieper tributary, the steppe-river Inhuletz, altho barely 100\r\nkm. shorter than the Pripet, is, for the same reasons, only capable of\r\ncarrying logs in the last 150 km. of its much-twisted course.\r\n\r\nOf the left-hand tributaries of the Dnieper only the northern ones\r\npossess a sufficient volume of water to be navigable. The Soz, which is\r\n550 kilometers in length, becomes as wide as 150 meters, and is\r\nnavigable for a stretch of nearly 360 kilometers. The Desna is the\r\nlongest of all the Dnieper tributaries (1000 km.). It rises near\r\nYelnia, on the Central Russian Plateau, and flows in a broad\r\nsymmetrical valley, which it floods in places every spring to the\r\nextent of 10 kilometers. The normal width of the river at low-water is\r\n160 meters; the depth is 6 meters. Despite many shallows and\r\nsand-banks, the Desna is capable of bearing rafts along a stretch of\r\n250 kilometers, and is navigable for 700 kilometers even for the larger\r\nriver boats. Of the Ukrainian tributaries of the Desna, the most\r\nimportant is the Sem, which is 650 km. long and navigable for 500\r\nkilometers.\r\n\r\nAll the other left-hand tributaries of the Dnieper flow in broad\r\nvalleys, with high right slopes and low left slopes, covered with\r\nstagnant waters, marshy meadows and areas of sand. But, altho they all\r\nlook very imposing at the time of the spring floods, yet, neither the\r\nSula with its high wooded banks, nor the Psiol with its 670 km. of\r\nlength, neither the Vorscla flowing along between sandbanks and dunes,\r\nnor the Orel sliding slowly along with its twisted course—none of these\r\nhave any significance for navigation. Only the steppe-river Samara,\r\nflowing between granite banks, is capable of floating rafts along a\r\nshort stretch. There was a time, however, in which all these rivers\r\nwere navigable, even for ships of considerable size. Great old anchors\r\nand wreckage of ships, which are found in the beds and banks of these\r\nrivers, are sufficient proof of this fact. The cause of the present\r\ncondition may be sought in the destruction of forest in the drainage\r\ncountry. The spring floods, increased from this cause, develop\r\nconsiderable destructive activity, filling up the river bed with masses\r\nof sand and mud, floating brushes and stumps of trees. The decreased\r\nvolume of water in the dry season, due to the drying up of the swamps\r\nand springs, can not transport these deposits further, and the river\r\nbecomes unfit for any sort of navigation.\r\n\r\nThe Don (Din) is the fourth in the series of rivers of Europe. It is\r\nover 1800 kilometers long, but the country it drains is smaller in area\r\nby 100,000 square kilometers than that of the Dnieper. Hardly\r\none-fourth of the Don country belongs to the Ukraine, and even less of\r\nits course. For this reason it was long considered as a border stream\r\nof the Ukraine on the east, until the past century extended the\r\nboundaries of Ukrainian territory into the Kuban region and to the\r\nCaspian Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Don rises in Lake Ivan-Ozero, which has also an outlet to the Aka\r\non the Central Russian elevation of ground. Its valley is at first\r\ndeeply cut, its bed rocky. Then the valley widens and becomes\r\nsymmetrical, the left bank becomes flat and swampy, covered in places\r\nby wide areas of sand. In the source region the direction of the river\r\nis south as far as Korotniak, then the river turns to the southeast,\r\nforms a sharp bend at the mouth of the Ilovla, approaching to within 60\r\nkm. of the Volga. Then the Don repeats on a small scale the direction\r\nof the course of the Dnieper, turns toward the southwest, and\r\ndisembogues in thirty arms, of which only three are navigable and only\r\none accessible to sea-vessels, into the Sea of Azof. Its delta region\r\nis very rich in fish and is growing very rapidly. The general volume of\r\nthe Don is twice as small as that of the Dnieper and is subject to many\r\nvacillations. During the spring floods the water-level reaches 6–7 m.\r\nabove the normal and the river becomes as much as 10 km. wide. At the\r\ntime of low-water, on the other hand, the river, despite its width (in\r\nthe lower part of its course) of 200 to 400 m. and depths of 2–16 m.,\r\nis full of sandbanks and shallows, so that navigation on the Don is but\r\nslightly developed, altho more than 1300 km. of its course may be\r\nconsidered fit for floating rafts of logs and 300 km. for ships. The\r\nfreezing-time lasts on the average 100 days.\r\n\r\nOf the left-hand tributaries of the Don, the Voronizh, Bitiuh, Khoper,\r\nMedveditza, and the Manich (famous, because of its bifurcation) are the\r\nmost important. Of the right-hand tributaries only one, the Donetz, is\r\nimportant. Its entire course belongs to Ukrainian national territory.\r\nIt is 1000 km. long, and, in its southerly and then south-easterly\r\ndirection, entirely analogous to the Dnieper and the Don. The Donetz\r\nflows in a broad valley and washes beautiful white cliffs along the\r\nsteep right bank, crowned with dark forests. The Donetz is capable of\r\nfloating rafts along a stretch of over 300 km., and is navigable for\r\n200 km. more.\r\n\r\nOf the steppe-rivers which tend toward the Sea of Azof from the east,\r\nonly the Yeia reaches its goal. All the rest end their courses in\r\nlagoons.\r\n\r\nThe last great river of the Ukraine is the Kuban, 800 km. long. It\r\nrises in the glaciers of the Elbrus and flows, a roaring mountain\r\nstream, in a narrow and deep rocky defile. A great number of the\r\nmountain streams of the northern Caucasus slope empty into the Kuban\r\nand make it a stream of considerable volume. In the Stavropol hill\r\ncountry the Kuban turns in a widely-drawn curve toward the west. Its\r\nvalley becomes broad and flat, covered with bogs, swampy forests and\r\nwildernesses of reeds. From the left side it receives a number of\r\ntributaries from the Caucasus, the most important being the Laba and\r\nthe Bila. In the midst of immense plavni, lakes and limans, the Kuban\r\nforms its many-armed delta, which carries its waters partly to the\r\nBlack Sea, partly to the Sea of Azof, and embraces the peninsula of\r\nTaman.\r\n\r\nThe Kuban always has a large volume, the floods coming in the early\r\nsummer, when the snow blanket of the Caucasus melts. Navigation is\r\ngreatly injured because of banks of sand and rubble, brush and\r\ntree-stumps, but is, nevertheless, possible for a distance of over 350\r\nkm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UKRAINIAN CLIMATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great uniformity of Eastern Europe, in respect to its morphology,\r\nwe find repeated in its climatic conditions. But, to the same extent\r\nthat the attentive investigator, upon close observation, finds several\r\nindependent morphological individualities within the Eastern European\r\nlow country, he will also observe important climatic differences in\r\nthis great half-continent.\r\n\r\nThe Central European climatic zone stops at the western borders of the\r\nUkraine. Similarly, the cool Eastern European continental climate,\r\nwhich rules over all of White and Great Russia, embraces only\r\ninsignificant borderlands in the north of Ukrainian territory. The\r\nUkrainian climate assumes an entirely independent position. It is more\r\ncontinental than that of Central Europe and differs from that of Great\r\nRussia in its greater mildness. The Ukraine shares with France the\r\nadvantage that in its territory the direct transition from the\r\ntemperate climate of Eastern Europe to the Mediterranean climate of\r\nSouthern Europe takes place.\r\n\r\nThe thermal conditions of the Ukraine, despite its great size, are very\r\nuniform. The yearly averages fluctuate between +6° and +9° C. Ternopil,\r\nin Podolia, and Vovchansk, in the Kharkov country, have the same yearly\r\ntemperature of +6.3°, Pinsk +6.7°, Kiev and Kharkiv +6.8°, Lviv\r\n(Lemberg) and Poltava +6.9°. The differences are confined within a\r\nspace of 1°C. Chernivtzi (Czernowitz) in the Bukowina, Yelisavet in the\r\nKherson region, and Luhan in the Donetz region have an annual\r\ntemperature of 7.6° or 7.7°, Katerinoslav on the Dnieper, Tahanroh on\r\nthe Sea of Azof, and Stavropol in the sub-Caucasus country 8.3° or\r\n8.2°. This great coincidence of yearly averages in so widely separated\r\nplaces is all the more surprising, since the mean temperature falls\r\nconsiderably directly behind the borders of the Ukraine. Thus, Kursk\r\nhas only +5.2°, Voroniz +5.4°.\r\n\r\nNot until we reach the southern borders of the Ukraine does the mean\r\ntemperature rise considerably. Odessa and Kishiniv have +9.8°, Mikolaiv\r\n+9.7°, Simferopol +10.1°, Sevastopol +12.2°, Katerinodar +12.1°,\r\nNovorossiysk +12°, Yalta +13.4° mean annual temperature. The last-named\r\nplace actually lies in the narrow belt of the Mediterranean climate, on\r\nthe southern slope of the Yaila Mountains.\r\n\r\nComparing the annual averages of the Ukraine with those of different\r\nplaces in Western and Central Europe, the latter appear relatively much\r\nhigher. London, situated in the same geographical latitude as Kursk has\r\nan annual temperature almost twice as high (+10.3°). London is on the\r\naverage even a little warmer than Simferopol, which actually lies 650\r\nkm. nearer the equator. Brussels lies a little more north than Kiev,\r\nyet it is in the mean warmer than Odessa.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this unfavorable relation is the severe winter of the\r\nUkraine. The mean temperature of January is +3.5° in London, +2° in\r\nBrussels, +1.2° in Frankfort a m., -1.2° in Prague, -3.3° in Cracow. In\r\nthe Ukraine the January means are much lower. Lemberg has -4.6°, Kiev\r\nhas -6.2°, Kharkiv -8.3°, Luhan -8°, Vovchansk -7.7°, Katerinoslav\r\n-7.4°, etc. To be sure this is not remarkable when compared with the\r\nJanuary temperatures of even the south of Great Russia, where the\r\nwinter suggests polar conditions, but the antithesis to the winter\r\nclimate of Western and Central Europe is striking. Hammerfest, the\r\nnorthernmost city of the earth, is one degree warmer than Kiev in\r\nJanuary and even a little warmer than Lemberg.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the summer of the Ukraine is even warmer than that\r\nof Western and Central Europe. The July mean of London is +17.9° C., of\r\nBrussels 18°, Lemberg the same, but Kiev has as much as 19.2°, Kharkiv\r\n20.9°. The differences in the summer temperatures are much smaller,\r\nhowever, than the differences in the winter temperatures—hence the\r\ncomparatively low annual mean in the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThese figures clearly show the continental character of the Ukrainian\r\nclimate. The influences of the Atlantic Ocean, which still strongly\r\ndominate the climate of Central Europe, become slight in the Ukraine.\r\nParticularly, the southern part of the Ukraine is almost unaffected by\r\nthe mitigating influence of a nearby ocean, and the necessary result is\r\nthe low winter-temperatures. But the continental character of the\r\nUkrainian climate is, nevertheless, not so strongly marked as that of\r\nthe Russian or Siberian climate. Kamishin, Semipalatinsk,\r\nBlagovieshchensk, situated on the same degree of latitude as Kiev, have\r\na January mean of -11.6°, 17.5° and -25.4°, and a July mean of +24.1°,\r\n+22.2° and +21.3°, respectively. The influences of the Black Sea, altho\r\nin general not great, are at least unmistakable in the coastal region\r\nof the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the mean of the coldest and that of the warmest\r\nmonth is slighter in the Ukraine than in Russia or Siberia, to be sure,\r\nbut it is, at any rate, considerable. Only in the Mediterranean climate\r\nof Southern Crimea does the difference amount to as little as 20°. The\r\nrest of Crimea, the sub-Caucasian country and the northwestern part of\r\nthe Ukraine as far as Kiev and Uman have a difference of 20°-25°,\r\nLemberg, for example, 22.6°, Pinsk 24°, Chernivtzi 25.1°, Kiev 25.2°.\r\nOn the other hand, the southern and the entire eastern part of the\r\nUkraine, especially east of the Dnieper, shows a considerable\r\ndifference, from 25° to 30°, as for example, Kiev 25.4°, Odessa and\r\nMikolaiv 26.3°, Poltava 27.3°, Kharkiv and Tahanroh over 29°, Luhan and\r\nKaterinoslav 30.4°.\r\n\r\nThe winter appears severe in the entire Ukraine, with the exception of\r\nCrimea and the sub-Caucasian country.\r\n\r\nThe January mean temperature of -4° to -8° then obtains in the entire\r\nwide territory. Lemberg has -4.3°, Tarnopol -5.5°, Chernivtzi -5.1°,\r\nKiev -6.2°, Vovchansk -7.7°, Katerinoslav -7.4°, Mikolaiv -4.3°,\r\nTahanroh -6.7°, Luhan -8°. Even the southern lands of the Ukraine have\r\na low mean for January, for example, Odessa -3.7° (Kishiniv -3.5°),\r\nwhile Kamenetz owes its exceptionally high mean, -3.3°, to its\r\nsheltered location in a “yar.” The January isotherms run from northwest\r\nto southeast in Ukrainian territory, in a wide curve, which becomes\r\nincreasingly flat toward the southeast. For this reason the cold in the\r\nUkraine grows in intensity not in a northern but in a northeastern\r\ndirection. The mean annual minimum almost everywhere exceeds -20°\r\n(Lemberg -19.2°, Chernivtzi -21.1°, Tarnopol -23.4°, Kiev -23.2°,\r\nMikolaiv -21.4°, Luhan -28.4°). The absolute extremes attain very high\r\nvalues. The absolute minimum amounts to -30° in Mikolaiv and Odessa,\r\n-33.1° in Kiev, -34° in Ternopil, -35° in Lemberg and Czernowitz,\r\n-40.8° in Luhan.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian winter is far less variable than the Central European or\r\neven the Russian. Only in the northwestern borderlands of the Ukraine\r\ndoes a thaw, brought by the Atlantic winds, frequently appear. The\r\nduration of the frost on the Pontian shore is at most two months, in\r\nthe Pontian steppe-plain and the southern spurs of the plateau groups\r\nthree months, in all the rest of the Ukraine three and a half. Only in\r\nthe northeastern borderlands of the Ukraine, located on the spurs of\r\nthe Central Russian elevation and the Donetz, does the frost period\r\nextend over four months.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Ukraine the winter is followed directly by a sunny spring,\r\nwith dry east winds, which partly degenerate into sand-storms\r\n(sukhovi). Everywhere else in the Ukraine wet, sloppy weather follows\r\nthe steps of the receding winter. Toward the northwest it continues\r\nlonger and longer. The sloppy weather of spring consists of a\r\nconstantly varying succession of frost, thaw, snowstorm, rain and\r\nsunshine, ending in the southern part of the Ukraine usually in the\r\nmiddle of April, in the northern and northwestern part at the end of\r\nApril or even at the beginning of May. The actual spring following\r\nthereon is very short thruout the Ukraine and usually lasts three\r\nweeks, except in the northwest, where it continues thru the entire\r\nmonth of May. The mean April temperature is everywhere higher than the\r\nannual mean (Lemberg +7.8°, Tarnopol and Kiev +6.9°, Czernowitz and\r\nOdessa +8.6°, Luhan -8.1°). But the month of May is quite as warm as\r\nJuly in England. On the other hand, we find May frosts in the entire\r\nUkraine as far as the shores of the Black Sea, altho they do not appear\r\nso destructive here as in Russia proper.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian summer is everywhere marked by considerable heat. Only in\r\nthe northwest corner of the Ukraine (Rostoche, Pidlassye, Polissye,\r\nVolhynia) is the summer moderately warm (Lemberg +19.1°, Ternopil\r\n+18.7°, Pinsk +18°).\r\n\r\nThe July temperature of all the rest of the Ukraine is much higher than\r\nthis. The July isotherm of +20°, like all the July isotherms of the\r\nUkraine, runs in a northeast direction past the source of the Sbruch\r\nand the mouth of the Pripet, and the further we advance from this line\r\ntowards the southeast, the hotter the summers we find. On the lower\r\nDniester and Dnieper the mean July temperature exceeds +23°. Following\r\nare a number of July means: Czernowitz +20.1°, Kiev +19.2°, Vovchansk\r\n+20.3°, Odessa +22.6°, Katerinoslav and Mikolaiv +23°, Luhan +22.4°,\r\nTahanroh +22.8°. The strongest degrees of heat are +37° to +43°, and\r\nthe mean annual maxima are +30.3° for Ternopil, +31.1° for Lemberg,\r\n+32.7° for Czernowitz, +32.1° for Kiev, +35.2° for Mikolaiv, +35.5° for\r\nLuhan. The duration of the heat period with temperatures of +20° and\r\nover is two months southeast of a line which runs near Kishiniv,\r\nPoltava and Kharkiv, one month southeast of the line of Mohiliv, Kaniv\r\nand Kursk. The total duration of the summer is only in the northwest of\r\nthe Ukraine as short as three months; otherwise it is four, and on the\r\nBlack Sea even four and a half.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of the Ukraine is regularly very beautiful and comparatively\r\nwarm. The month of October has a mean of temperature higher than the\r\nannual (Lemberg +8.5°, Ternopil +7.7°, Czernowitz +9°, Kiev +7.5°,\r\nVovchansk +7°, Katerinoslav +9.7°, Luhan +8.4°, Odessa +11°, Mikolaiv\r\n+9.7°, Tahanroh +9.1°). But even in October the warm sunny days are\r\nfollowed by night frosts. The moist autumnal weather which begins the\r\ntransition to winter lasts as much as two months in the northwest;\r\nbeyond that, one to one and a half months. The mean date of the\r\nearliest frost is October 19th for Kiev, October 11th for Luhan,\r\nOctober 28th for Micolaiv, and November 10th for Odessa.\r\n\r\nA different position, climatically, is that of Crimea, the\r\nsub-Caucasian country, as well as the mountain islands of the\r\nCarpathians, the Yaila and the Caucasus. In the temperature conditions\r\nof Crimea and the sub-Caucasus country, the influence of their\r\nsoutherly location and the proximity of the sea is everywhere apparent.\r\nThe mean temperature is everywhere higher than +10° (Simferopol +10.1°,\r\nSevastopol +12.2°, Katerinodar +12.1°). The winter is short and\r\ncomparatively mild (January mean of Simferopol +0.8°, Sevastopol +1.8°,\r\nKaterinodar +2.1°, Stavropol -4.7°), but very variable. The degrees of\r\nfrost are sometimes quite high (Sevastopol -16.9°, Stavropol -25.6° as\r\nabsolute minima), but the frost period is short (one to two months).\r\nThe spring begins in March with full force; in May follows the\r\nfive-months’ summer. The July means are very high, especially in the\r\nsub-Caucasus country, the heat period lasting everywhere more than two\r\nmonths. (July mean of Simferopol +28°, Sevastopol 33.1°, Stavropol\r\n+20°, Katerinodar +25.3°). The long autumn also is very mild.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Yaila and Caucasus Mountains, on the shore of the Black\r\nSea, lies a narrow strip of land which actually shows Mediterranean\r\nclimatic characteristics. The winter lasts less than a month and is\r\nvery mild (January mean of Yalta +3.5°, altho the absolute minimum is\r\n-13°), and, as in Novorossiysk, cold, bora-like gusts of wind are\r\ncommon in times of heavy cold. After a long spring follows a\r\nsix-months’ summer, which passes imperceptibly into a mild autumn.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the mountains of the Ukraine has been but little\r\ninvestigated. In the entire Ukrainian territory there is not a single\r\nmeteorological observatory. The general characteristics of mountain\r\nclimate, its greater uniformity, the smaller difference between the\r\nwarmest and coldest months, the belated beginning of all the seasons,\r\netc., may be found in all the mountains of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nOnly the climate of the Ukrainian Carpathians is somewhat better known.\r\nThe dreariest climate is that of the Beskyds and the Gorgani. The\r\nfive-months’ winter and long periods of sloppy weather in the spring\r\nand in the fall encroach upon the short summer. The Chornohora chain,\r\ndespite the greater height of its peaks, upon which the snow in\r\nsheltered places remains lying thru the entire summer, has a much\r\nmilder and pleasanter climate. The influence of the warm summer of the\r\nadjacent plain regions limits the duration of the sloppy weather in\r\nspring and autumn. For this reason, the mountain valleys have a short\r\nbut very beautiful spring, a warm summer, and a wonderful mild autumn.\r\nThe mountain pastures have in place of the summer only a three months’\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nIn the Yaila Mountains, as a result of their small size and height, the\r\ncharacteristics of typical mountain climate are lacking, but in the\r\nCaucasus we find them in their highest development. The analogy to the\r\nAlps is perfect, but the influence of the continental steppe climate of\r\nthe surrounding country is unmistakable, expressing itself in the\r\nposition of the various climatic regions, in the height of the snow\r\nlimit, in the development of the glacial covering, etc., very\r\ndistinctly and very differently than in the Alps, which are surrounded\r\nby countries with a climate of a different kind.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the second group of climatic phenomena, pressure and\r\nwind conditions. The Ukraine may, in this respect, be divided into two\r\ngreat regions. The line of high pressure which separates these parts,\r\ncalled by Voiekoff the great axis of Europe, extends from the bend of\r\nthe Volga, near Tsaritsin, over the porohi section of the Dnieper at\r\nKaterinoslav to Kishinev. North of this line, west winds prevail,\r\nbringing Atlantic air into Northern Ukraine. In the south, east winds\r\nprevail, bearing the influences of the Asiatic steppe climate. This\r\nwind divide is most distinct in winter. In the northern part of the\r\nUkraine we find chiefly west and southwest winds, which mitigate the\r\nfrosts and cause precipitations of rainfall; in the southern part dry,\r\ncold east winds prevail, increasing the cold. Sometimes the east wind\r\nincreases to a snowstorm (metelitzia, fuga) which whirls up terrible\r\nmasses of snow, filling the air with snowflakes until absolutely\r\nnothing can be seen, and causes terrific destruction. Herds of a\r\nthousand head fall victim to its icy breath, even in the steppes of\r\nCrimea, and woe to the traveler who is caught in a snowstorm in the\r\nsteppe.\r\n\r\nIn November and December, in Southern Ukraine, moist, warm south winds\r\nfrequently come up from the Pontus. But the absolute balance is on the\r\nside of the freezing east winds, to which is to be ascribed the severe\r\nwinter climate of Southern Ukraine. The northern half of the Ukraine as\r\na rule, is seldom reached by the east winds, the northwestern corner\r\nvery seldom. Their occasional appearance is accompanied by heavy frosts\r\nwith fair weather.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, east and south winds blow, especially over Southern\r\nUkraine. They often change to heavy sand-storms (sukhovi) very harmful\r\nto the crops, which carry clouds of sand, with which they form\r\nminiature dunes as high as 30 cm. The east and south winds, at such\r\ntimes, penetrate even into Northern Ukraine, altho with the exception\r\nof the northwest corner.\r\n\r\nIn the summer, on the other hand, the west, northwest, and southwest\r\nwinds hold a decided balance over the east winds, even in Southern\r\nUkraine. They bring moist Atlantic air and rain into the entire land\r\nand mitigate the heat. The occasional east winds increase the heat and\r\nbring periods of drought, but usually not until August, when they are\r\nrather frequent. In September all the winds are weak thruout the\r\nUkraine, with high pressure. That is why the fall is so beautiful too.\r\nThen, in October and November, follows the gradual transition to the\r\nwinter wind conditions.\r\n\r\nThe third group of atmospheric phenomena, humidity and precipitation,\r\npossesses the same great uniformity in Ukrainian territory as the other\r\ntwo elements of the climate. The humidity of the air in the Ukraine is\r\nin general slight. It is greatest in the forest-covered partly swampy\r\nWest and Northwest. Toward the southeast the humidity in the Ukraine\r\nconstantly decreases. Fogs appear seldom and are only light, so that\r\nthe antithesis to Western and Central Europe, as well as Russia, is\r\nstriking. The light night and morning fogs which appear, especially in\r\nthe latter part of summer and in the fall, only contribute to the\r\nbeautification of the landscape, by flooding the depressions of land\r\nlike a sea. Cloud-formation is much slighter in the Ukraine than in\r\nWestern or Central Europe, or in Russia proper, the dreary Muscovite\r\ncountry. The greatest number of clouded days occurs in the western and\r\nnorthwestern part of the Ukraine; toward the southeast and east the\r\nnumber of such days dwindles continuously. The least amount of cloudy\r\nweather occurs in the month of August. In September and October the\r\nincrease is very slight. November and December are much cloudier and\r\nJanuary is most cloudy all over the Ukraine. After that the cloudy\r\nweather lessens considerably at first, then slowly, until August.\r\n\r\nThe atmospheric precipitations in the Ukraine are in general\r\ninsignificant, except in the Carpathian and Caucasus regions. The\r\nUkraine has less rainfall than Central or Western Europe. The Atlantic\r\nOcean, the most important source of the precipitations in Europe, lies\r\nfar distant, and the cyclonal systems on their way east drop their\r\ncollected moisture upon Western and Central Europe. For the Ukraine,\r\nand particularly for the eastern part of it, there is, therefore, very\r\nlittle left. In this connection the Black Sea has only a local\r\nsignificance, and the evaporation of water from the rivers, lakes and\r\nswamps, from the plants and the ground, is hardly worth considering,\r\nexcept as it happens in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe great amounts of precipitation are to be found in the mountains of\r\nthe Ukraine, where rising currents of air help along the condensation\r\nof the water vapor. Even in the Low Beskid the precipitation exceeds\r\n1000 mm. (Yasliska 1170 mm.), in the Gorgani and Chornohora we find in\r\nlarge areas, especially on the southern slope, a precipitation of over\r\n1200 mm., in a few places 1400 mm. (Kobiletzka Polana 1377 mm., Bradula\r\n1419 mm.). The amount of precipitation is still large in the entire\r\nPidhirye, but at only a short distance it decreases considerably.\r\nLemberg has only 735 mm. of rainfall, the southern part of the Rostoche\r\nas much as 900 mm. in places, since the western edges act like chains\r\nof mountains to the west winds. But Czernowitz, near as it is, has only\r\n619 mm. and the Podolia on the Dniester still less. The Khotin lying in\r\nthe yar of this river has only 300 mm., which best illustrates the\r\nsignificance of local conditions. At a greater distance from the curve\r\nof the Carpathians the amount of precipitation shows a slow but regular\r\ndecrease toward the southeast. Only in the northern part of the\r\nRostoche and the northwestern part of Podolia does the amount of\r\nprecipitation attain 600 mm., while further toward the south and east a\r\nwide zone stretches out with only 500–600 mm. (Pinsk 581 mm., Kiev 534\r\nmm., Uman 546 mm., Poltava 532 mm.). Another wide zone, which extends\r\nfrom the mouth of the Dniester to the bend of the Don, has a\r\nprecipitation of between 400 and 500 mm. (Kharkiv 465 mm., Katerinoslav\r\n475 mm., Kishinev 471 mm., Yelisavet 444 mm., Odessa 408 mm.). The next\r\nnarrow zone of the Pontian and Crimean steppe has a precipitation of\r\nless than 400 mm. (Mikolaiv 360 mm., Sevastopol 386 mm., Luhan 379\r\nmm.), a corner of Crimea on the peninsula of Tarkhankut has even barely\r\nmore than 200 mm.\r\n\r\nThe Yaila Mountain Range is too small to have any marked influence on\r\nthe increase in the amount of precipitation. Yalta has only 508 mm.\r\nprecipitation. On the other hand, the influence of the Caucasus is very\r\ngreat. The sub-Caucasus Kuban region, to be sure, has only 400–500 mm.\r\nprecipitation, Stavropol 720 mm., Novorossysk 691 mm. However, the\r\namount of precipitation on the southwestern side of the Caucasus\r\nMountains increases uncommonly. At the borders of Ukrainian territory,\r\nSochi has not less than 2071 mm.\r\n\r\nFrom this account we see clearly enough that, in comparison with\r\nCentral and Western Europe, the Ukraine is rather poor in rainfall,\r\nespecially in the southeast. But the distribution of the precipitations\r\namong the seasons is so favorable that most of them fall at the time\r\nthey are most needed, namely, in the early part of summer. The entire\r\nUkraine lies within the area of the summer rains, only the narrow strip\r\nof the south coast of Crimea and the Caucasus are within the area of\r\nthe winter rains.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the preponderance of the summer rains lies in the western\r\nand northwestern Atlantic winds, which, in that season, have easy\r\naccess far into the southeastern part of the Ukraine. These winds bring\r\nso much moisture into the Ukraine that almost two-thirds of the annual\r\nrainfall belongs to May, June and July. The month with the greatest\r\namount of precipitation for the entire Ukraine is June. Only the\r\nPolissye, Northwestern Volhynia and the western part of the Kiev\r\nterritory show the heaviest precipitation in July, since, in these\r\nregions of forests and swamps, evaporation is heaviest at this time of\r\ngreatest heat.\r\n\r\nThe summer rains of the Ukraine differ from those of Central or Western\r\nEurope in their heaviness. Only in the Western Ukraine are the summer\r\nrains of the type of gentle rains that are uniform for an entire\r\ncountry; in the south and east they appear as cloudbursts in heavy\r\nshowers. In Samashcani, in Bessarabia, there have been times when 200\r\nmm. of rain fell in a single day, in Korovintzi in the Poltava region,\r\n5 mm. in one minute. In the Pontian steppes all rain falls in the form\r\nof heavy showers. The water flows off quickly and evaporates rapidly,\r\nbefore it is able to thoroughly saturate the ground.\r\n\r\nElectric discharges and hailstorms occur in close connection with the\r\nsummer rains, most frequently in June, less so in July and in May. They\r\nusually come from the southwest in the afternoon hours. Most of these\r\nstorms originate in the Carpathian Mountains and reach Volhynia and\r\nKiev, but do not cross the Dnieper. The Caucasus, too, has very many\r\nstorms. Hailstorms are most frequent in Galicia and Volhynia and the\r\nwestern part of the Kiev regions; very rare in the southeast.\r\n\r\nIn August the amount of rainfall slowly decreases; in September and\r\nOctober still more, and so it continues until December. January is the\r\nmonth of least rainfall for the entire Ukraine (only one-fourth of the\r\nJune figure), and this circumstance is of particularly great\r\nsignificance for the southern and eastern parts of the Ukraine. For\r\nthis reason the cover of snow in the Ukraine is much less than in\r\nCentral Europe or Muscovy, besides which, it is often disturbed by\r\nsnowstorms. The slight snow-cover melts down quickly in the spring,\r\nwithout saturating the soil well, and without requiring much warmth.\r\nThis explains the rapid rise of heat in the Ukrainian spring.\r\n\r\nFrom January until the end of April the amount of rainfall again grows\r\nslowly but steadily, reaching its maximum in June.\r\n\r\nThe southern part of Crimea and the Caucasian shore have just the\r\nopposite annual distribution of the precipitations. Under the influence\r\nof the moist Pontian winds, the greatest amount of rain falls in\r\nDecember and January, while the spring and summer have very little\r\nrain. These characteristics of the Mediterranean climate, the rainy\r\nwinter after the dry summer, are all the more striking, since the\r\nopposite condition prevails on the other side of the Yaila and Caucasus\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nFrom this account of the Ukrainian climate we see that this climate\r\nretains an entirely independent position as against that of Central\r\nEurope or Russia. The Ukrainian climate is characterized by an annual\r\namplitude of 20° to 30°, a mean annual temperature of from +6° to +12°,\r\na July mean of from +19° to +24°, and a January mean of from 0° to 8°,\r\nwith predominant summer rains and a generally insignificant cover of\r\nsnow. The difference from the Russian climate is, consequently, quite\r\nconsiderable. The Russian climate forms the transition to the polar,\r\nthat of the Ukraine to the Mediterranean climate.\r\n\r\nNature has provided the Ukraine with a pleasant, very wholesome\r\nclimate. On the whole temperate, it does not lack heavy frosts and\r\nconsiderable degrees of heat, which harden the Ukrainian to any\r\ninclemencies of the weather. The differences of the seasons cause a\r\npleasant variety, strong winds clear the atmosphere and bring motion\r\ninto nature, the rains are everywhere sufficient for the growth of\r\nvegetation and the carrying on of the most important occupation of the\r\nUkraine—agriculture. The great uniformity of this Ukrainian climate has\r\nrecently caused the French geographer, de Martonne, to set it up as one\r\nof the types of climate of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORA AND FAUNA OF UKRAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern European bigness characterizes also the organic life of the\r\nUkraine. But it follows, from the location of the country, that the\r\nUkraine has a much more varied plant and animal geography than the\r\nproper Russian territory, despite the latter’s much greater extent.\r\n\r\nIn the Ukraine, the borders of three main divisions of plant-geography\r\nof Europe meet—the Mediterranean division, the steppe region, and the\r\nforest region, with their transition regions. Besides, we meet in the\r\nUkraine three mountain regions—the Carpathian, the Crimean, and the\r\nCaucasian. In respect to flora, the Ukraine possesses only a few\r\nendemic species. To be sure the great ice period covered only\r\ncomparatively small areas of the Ukraine with its glacier, but the\r\npolar flora undoubtedly prevailed in the entire country at that time.\r\nAfter the withdrawal of the glacier, steppes first appeared in its\r\nplace, which then, especially in the Northwest, were forced to make\r\nroom for a forest flora that had immigrated from Central Europe and\r\nSiberia. Hence, despite the considerable area of the Ukraine, so few\r\nendemic species.\r\n\r\nSince those primeval days, only a very few natural changes have\r\noccurred in the vegetation of the Ukraine. However, man, thru his\r\ncultural activity, has wrought many changes in the plant-world of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe forest region occupies barely one-fifth of the Ukrainian territory,\r\nonly the northwestern and northern borderlands. The southeastern border\r\nof the forest region extends from the Prut and Dniester on the western\r\nboundary of Pokutye and Podolia in a curve to the source of the Buh,\r\nthen near the northern boundary of the Dnieper Plateau east as far as\r\nKiev, and thence toward the northeast as far as the source of the Aka.\r\nThis boundary, however, is not sharp. In numerous peninsulas the\r\ncompact forest penetrates the adjacent transition region toward the\r\nsoutheast. On the other hand, this forest boundary coincides almost\r\nexactly with the northern boundary of the black soil. The soil of the\r\nforest region is in general poor. Only in higher places we find fertile\r\nturf; beyond that sandy soil and the podsol, rich in quartz,\r\npredominate.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing plant formation in this region is the forest. It once\r\ncovered the entire region and was thinned to any great extent only\r\nwithin the last two centuries. What these primeval forests were like we\r\ncan now tell in only a few districts of the Polissye and in the famous\r\nvirgin forest of Biloveza, which lies in the extreme northwest corner\r\nof the Ukrainian territory. Here we see the primeval forest in its\r\nmighty size and beauty. In wind-fallen woods, several meters high,\r\nrotten, decaying stumps cover the ground. Their roots stand up high\r\ninto the air above swampy holes and vast masses of rotting remains of\r\nplants. Above this swampy fen rise, like a vast mass of pillars, the\r\nknotty trunks of century-old oaks and lindens, ash and aspen, and the\r\nslender pine and fir. High above the ground their branches intertwine.\r\nAll strive up toward the sun, for a continuous semi-darkness reigns\r\nbelow. Shrub and herb vegetation thrives only in clearings; beyond that\r\nonly last year’s leaves, needles, and a mysteriously glowing decay\r\ncover the ground. Dead silence, only occasionally broken by the\r\nhammering of a woodpecker or by the timid voice of a bird, reigns\r\neverywhere, making all the more impressive the mighty roaring of the\r\nlofty crowns in the storm.\r\n\r\nAs to their composition, the woods of the Ukrainian forest region are\r\nmixed, altho local conditions cause one or the other species of tree to\r\npredominate. The Ukrainian forest region may be divided into two\r\nregions by a line running thru Lublin southeast toward Lutzk. Southwest\r\nof this line extends the Central European forest zone, northeast of it\r\nthe Northern European forest zone.\r\n\r\nThe Central European forest zone embraces the entire Pidhirye in the\r\nUkraine, the southern part of the Rostoche, and the western spurs of\r\nVolhynia and Podolia. It is distinguished by a greater variety of tree\r\nspecies. Here, upon damp, loamy hills, entire forests of beech are\r\nfound, on the Carpathian foothills the pine, and singly or in small\r\ngroups, the larch, the yew, the maple, etc. In the Northern European\r\nzone all these trees disappear, due to the increasing continentality of\r\nthe climate. The predominating species of tree here is the pine, which\r\nforms large woods everywhere on sandy soil, then the birch, which\r\nalways accompanies the pine, the fir on sandy soil, the oak and white\r\nbeech on loamy soil. There is an admixture of a considerable number of\r\nalders on swampy ground, aspens, lindens, elms, maples, ash and wild\r\napple, pear and cherry trees. Hazel bushes, willow (salix caprea),\r\nmountain ash, raspberry and blackberry bushes comprise the thick\r\nunderbrush in these mixed forests, and contribute a great deal to the\r\nbeauty of the woods, together with grass and herb vegetation,\r\nespecially in numerous clearings. In truer evergreen forests the\r\nunderbrush usually is very poor.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many swamp forests in the Ukrainian forest region. In\r\nthe Carpathian foothills they are called lasi, and are quite common\r\nthere, but in the Polissye they are most widely developed. There they\r\nare usually composed of pines, with which, however, the swampy ground\r\ndoes not agree very well. The alders and willows, however, grow all the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe second important formation of the forest region are the luhi. They\r\nusually stretch thru the wide, flat river valleys of the region. These\r\nare luxurious meadows with a beautiful growth of grass and herbs set\r\nwith single trees and clusters of trees. In dry places the oak usually\r\ngrows, in damp places the alder.\r\n\r\nThe third typical plant formation is that of the swamps. They are\r\nwidely developed in the forest region of the Ukraine, especially in the\r\nflat river valleys of the Rostoche and Volhynia. Polissye is the\r\ngreatest swamp country in Europe. Regular moors, made up of peat\r\nmosses, alternate even in the Polissye region with meadow moors, in\r\nwhich swamp grass and herb vegetation predominates.\r\n\r\nThe forest region has played a significant part in the history of the\r\nUkraine. When the Turkish nomad tribes, using the steppe district of\r\nthe Ukraine as a convenient military road, destroyed the work of\r\nUkrainian civilization in the steppe region, the Ukrainian people\r\nretreated into the forests and swamps of the north and west, advancing\r\ntoward the southeast again, at the proper moment, to reinhabit the\r\nravaged and desolated lands. This circle of events repeated itself\r\nfrequently in the history of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nToday the woods of the Ukraine forest region are greatly thinned, so\r\nthat they take up more than one-third of the total surface only in the\r\nPolissye. Cutting down and rooting up of the woods some centuries ago\r\nwas, without a doubt, an important part of the work of civilization.\r\nBut now things are different. Now the forest is considered a very\r\nimportant part of a well organized cultural section, and is, therefore,\r\ncarefully preserved in the truly civilized lands of Europe. In the\r\nbeautiful forests of the Ukraine, however, a reckless exploitation is\r\ngoing on, and the evil results are already apparent, especially in the\r\nsparsely wooded borders of the forest region, as well as in the entire\r\ncountry surrounding the steppe. The rivers have become small in volume\r\nof water, the sources dried up, and the ravines annually transform\r\nthousands of hectares into desert land. And this is happening in the\r\ngranary of Europe, which some 300 years ago made foreign travelers\r\nmarvel at its incredible fertility.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the Ukraine, as far as the foothills of the Yaila and\r\nthe Caucasus, is occupied by the steppe region. The limits of this\r\nregion, as we have said, are not distinct. In peninsula and island\r\nformations the forest penetrates toward the southeast. In this\r\ndirection the forest islands become constantly rarer and smaller, so\r\nthat the Russian plant-geographers have felt called upon to insert two\r\ntransition zones between the real forest and the real steppe—the zone\r\nof the exterior steppe and the zone of the transitional steppe. The\r\nactual steppe region is supposed to begin at the line which extends\r\nthru Kishinev and Katerinoslav to the bend of the Don. This division\r\nmay be criticized, however, since it at most, fits present conditions\r\nbrought about in the last 200 years by the destruction of forests on\r\nthe part of men. The historical sources of the Ukraine tell of large\r\nwoodlands, which, in the 16th, 17th and 18th Centuries, still extended\r\nalong the sources of the Inhul and Inhuletz, along the Tasmin, on the\r\nriver divides between the left-hand tributaries of the Dnieper, etc.\r\nThey were not forest terraces, not mere strips of woods confined to\r\nriver valleys; they covered the divides far and wide, as well as the\r\nbroad tableau sheds lying between rivers. For this reason care must be\r\ntaken in sketching the boundaries of the steppe. We therefore\r\ncomprehend both the above mentioned transition zones into one, for\r\nwhich we would suggest the name luhi zone, because the luh, a meadow\r\nstudded with scattered groups of trees and little groves, must have\r\nbeen the predominating plant formation of this transition country.\r\n\r\nThe typical soil of the transition country, as well as of the steppe\r\nregion, is the black earth (Ukr. chornozem, Russ. chernozyom). Every\r\nUkrainian is familiar with this blackish, ever fertile soil, which\r\ncannot be duplicated the world over and which makes the Ukraine the\r\ngranary of Russia. The black earth is a product of the transformation\r\nof loess, with a strong admixture of the products of decomposition of\r\nplants. In places it attains a depth of 2 m. and over.\r\n\r\nThe black-earth region extends longitudinally thru the Ukraine,\r\nembracing over three-fourths of its territory. The northern boundary of\r\nthe black-earth region passes from Lemberg along the north border of\r\nthe Podolian and Dnieper Plateau as far as Kiev, and then northeast to\r\nthe bend of the Aka, south of Kaluga. The southern boundary describes a\r\nline drawn thru the Boh and Dnieper deltas to their limans and the city\r\nof Mariupol. The entire Kuban plain and the plateau of Stavropol also\r\nbelong to the region of black earth. Along the northern border of the\r\nblack-earth region extends a transition zone of about 100 kilometers\r\nwidth, whose black earth contains 4 to 6% decaying plant matter. South\r\nof this lies the wide main area of the black earth with 6 to 10%\r\ndecaying matter. On the sea and along the lower Dnieper the region ends\r\nwith another transition zone, whose brownish black earth contains 4 to\r\n6% of decaying matter. On the Sea of Azof and in Southern Crimea the\r\nbrown dry steppe soil, with numerous islands of saline soil\r\n(solonchaki) and a peculiar vegetation, inclined to absorb salt,\r\nprevails. These are present also in the remaining black earth region,\r\nand there are also islands and strips of saline earth along the rivers\r\nand the seashore.\r\n\r\nIn the steppe region, the steppe is not the only plant formation. Above\r\nall we must differentiate between the meadow-steppe of the transition\r\nzone and the real steppe of the south, as well as the desert steppe in\r\nsome districts of Crimea and the Caucasus. Besides this shrub\r\nformation, meadow-woods (luhi) and real forests are found in the steppe\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetation of the meadow-steppe, grasses and herbs take the\r\nfirst place. Of the grasses the stippa species are the most\r\ncharacteristic (tirsa, kovil); of the herbs, the lily-like growths. The\r\ngrowth of grass in the northern part of the steppe region is very\r\nluxuriant and thick, and attains great heights, altho the times in\r\nwhich a rider and his horse might disappear in the grass belong to the\r\npast. High weeds and thistles (buriani, bodiaki) form thickets of great\r\nluxuriance. In the spring, when the fresh young grass begins to sprout\r\nup and the blossoming herbs convert the steppe into a carpet of\r\nflowers, when everything is resplendent with the fulness of life and\r\nbeauty, then the Ukrainian steppe presents a wonderful picture. But\r\nthis picture is not lasting. The heat and the drought transform the\r\nfresh, green, primitive color into yellow and brown. Grasses and herbs\r\nwither and die away, and only the roots and seeds preserve the living\r\npower of the plant, surviving the autumnal drought and the severe cold\r\nof winter, once more to wrap the steppe in its bridal gown in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of the steppe region the plant covering is not so\r\nluxurious as in the north, and the grasses and herbs grow in isolated\r\nlittle bushes, between which the bare ground of the steppe remains\r\nvisible. The saline earth appears much oftener, with its gray-green\r\nvegetation of salt plants, and we often find sand areas, which begin to\r\nsuggest the desert steppes of the Caspian steppe country.\r\n\r\nA characteristic plant formation in the entire steppe region is\r\ncomprised by the bushes (bairaki, chahari), which generally consist of\r\nheavily tangled thickets of wild cherry (prunus chamaecerasus,\r\nvishennik), spiral (tavolha), snowball (calina), almond shrub\r\n(amygdalus nana, bobovnik), etc. They generally grow in the steppe\r\nbalkas, or near them, and cover extended areas.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian steppe, despite contrary current opinion, does not lack\r\ntree growth. In the region of the real steppe, to be sure, we meet only\r\nforest terraces, which extend along the river courses, but in the\r\ntransition zone we still find woods and groves, which not only appear\r\nin river valleys, but also cover the plateaus between these. The oak,\r\nthe white beech, the maple, the poplar, the wild apple and pear trees,\r\nare the chief representatives of the tree species of the woods of this\r\nsection. Even the pine ventures as far as the district of Kharkiv.\r\n\r\nBesides the forest terraces, the rivers of the steppe region are\r\naccompanied by the formation of the so-called plavni. They are thickets\r\nof sedge and reeds, with luxuriant willow and alder growth; in drier\r\nplaces, which are flooded only during high-water time, real oak forests\r\nare added. With pleasure the eye of the traveler, wearied by the\r\nuniformity of the steppe, rests upon them.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of the steppes of the Ukraine, scholars differ. Every\r\none of them thinks he has found the only correct explanation. In\r\nreality, the origin and preservation of the Ukrainian steppes can be\r\ntraced to the combined action of various causes. In the first place\r\nthere is the continental dry climate. The amount of rainfall is too\r\nslight for the development of forest-flora; the drought of the summer\r\nand fall too long.\r\n\r\nA minor cause is the salt content of the steppe-soil, which, however,\r\nis apparent only in places. On the other hand, the shape of the ground\r\nis very important. Where the land is level, where the dry steppe winds\r\nhave free play and the rainwater cannot easily dissolve and wash away\r\nthe salt of the soil, the steppe prevails. Where the land is cut by\r\nriver valleys and balkas, however, there is more shelter from wind,\r\nmore moisture, and no salt in the soil, so that conditions are given\r\nwhich are favorable for the development of tree vegetation. For this\r\nreason not only the valleys of the rivers, but also the balkas, which\r\nbut seldom carry water, have always had tree growth, and even woods and\r\ngroves. The trees which are planted there thrive very well, while\r\nattempts at cultivation in the real level steppe almost regularly fail.\r\nThe most important foundation for the existence of steppes, however, is\r\ntheir character as remains of the old post-glacial steppe formation.\r\nSince the beginnings of the alluvial epoch, its territory is being won\r\nby the forest, which is constantly pushing forward toward the south and\r\nsoutheast, using the river valleys as the main lines of advance. In\r\nthis advance toward the south, the forest has now been stopped by man\r\nbefore it was able to reach the shore of the Black Sea and the Sea of\r\nAzof.\r\n\r\nMan has wrought many changes in the steppe region. In the first place\r\nhe has entered into the struggle between the woods and the steppe in\r\nopposition to the woods. The ancient Ukrainians of the Kiev state\r\nrooted out great areas of forest and reclaimed them for civilization.\r\nOn the other hand, the nomad tribes, roaming the steppes ever since man\r\ncan remember, repeatedly destroyed forests with fire, in order to\r\nobtain good pasture for their herds and to break down the best defense\r\nof the agricultural Ukrainian population. In the 16th Century began the\r\ndeforestation of the transition zone thru the progressing colonization\r\nmovement of the Ukrainians, under the protection of the Cossack\r\norganization. But even in the 18th Century there were still great\r\nforests in the transition zone, which have since entirely disappeared.\r\nThe intensive colonization movement of the 19th Century put an end to\r\nthem. At the same time the hand of man attacked the steppe formation.\r\nToday only very small parcels of steppe are in their original\r\ncondition. The steppe grasses have yielded place to an increasingly\r\nintensive cultivation of grain grasses; the place of the natural steppe\r\nhas been usurped by the cultivated steppe, with its waving fields of\r\ngrain and inevitable dreary stubble fields. With the progressive\r\ndestruction of forests this cultivated steppe of man’s fields\r\nconstantly moves toward the north and west of the Ukraine, favoring the\r\naccompanying migration of the steppe-plants and steppe animals into\r\nCentral Europe.\r\n\r\nEntirely independent is the position of the Ukrainian flora in the\r\nsouthern slope of the Yaila and the Caucasus. They belong really to the\r\nMediterranean Sea region. The mild climate here has matured a flora of\r\nan entirely southern type, with many evergreen trees and shrubs\r\npeculiar to the Mediterranean region. Yet the vegetation of this\r\ndistrict can only be considered as the advance guard of the real\r\nMediterranean vegetation, for the representatives of the northern flora\r\nby far predominate over the southern species of plants, particularly in\r\nthe forests which develop in higher altitudes.\r\n\r\nBesides the just discussed plant-geographical regions and zones of the\r\nplain, the Ukraine has three mountain regions—the Carpathian, the\r\nCrimean and the Caucasian.\r\n\r\nThe foot of the Carpathians is covered by mixed and leafy forests.\r\nWhite beech, birch, linden, aspen and pine comprise these forests. At\r\none time the oak predominated here, as it still does on the southern\r\nslope of the mountain range. On higher ridges of the Low and High\r\nBeskid, mixed forests of beech and fir are found. At the upper tree\r\nlimit of the High Beskid the beech appears almost exclusively in forest\r\nformation. The trees become constantly smaller and more gnarled, and at\r\na height of 1000 m. we meet only beech brush. On the southern side of\r\nthe mountain range pure beech woods prevail.\r\n\r\nIn the Gorgani we soon distinguish two forest zones. The lower one has\r\nprincipally beech woods, with an admixture of firs and maples; the\r\nupper one consists almost entirely of fir woods. Their upper limit\r\nusually lies at a height of from 1500 to 1600 m., but the zekoti (seas\r\nof sandstone boulders), which cover all the higher peaks and ridges,\r\nreduce the upper tree limit a great deal in some places.\r\n\r\nIn the Chornohory, a similar division of the forest zone prevails. Oak\r\nforests, with thick underbrush, cover the foot of the range on both\r\nslopes. Above the oak woods lies the zone of mixed forests, in which\r\nwhite and red beech, birch, ash, maple and firs predominate. Above the\r\nheight of 1300 m. lies the upper tree zone, which is made up of stocks\r\nof fir entirely. The upper tree limit lies at a height of 1700 m. The\r\nmilder climate of the Chornohory matures a much more luxurious and a\r\nricher vegetation than in other parts of the Ukrainian Carpathians.\r\n\r\nIn the forest zones of the Carpathians, great complex primeval forests\r\nhave survived to a great extent. They lie in inaccessible places, which\r\nthe bandit axe of the professional forest destroyer has not yet\r\npenetrated. The Carpathian virgin forest is, perhaps, the most\r\nbeautiful plant formation of the Ukraine. Giant firs, as much as 60 m.\r\nin height and six feet thick, raise their dark green slender pyramids\r\nabove rocky slopes and immense wind-fallen woods, in which the modern\r\nfirs lie in piles. Thick shrubbery covers the clearings, while in the\r\neternal semi-darkness of the thickets, on rocky ground covered with\r\nneedles, just an occasional pillow of moss may be found.\r\n\r\nA second plant-formation of the Carpathians is that of the\r\ndwarf-shrubs. They develop above the forest limit and cover wide areas\r\nin the Gorgani and Chornohori. Mountain fir (zerep), accompanied by\r\njuniper (in the Beskyds and Gorgani) and by dwarf-alder bushes (lelich,\r\nin the Chornohory), in thickets which are impassible in places. The\r\nformerly widely distributed stone pine has become rare, since its\r\nfragrant wood is preferred by the mountain-dwellers for all sorts of\r\nwoodwork.\r\n\r\nThe third plant formation of the Carpathians are their mountain meadows\r\n(polonini). They lie above the forest limit and begin to appear at the\r\nsource of the San. Toward the southeast they become constantly more\r\nluxuriant and more frequent. The grass and herb growth of the polonini\r\nis very varied and rich, especially in the so-called zarinki, that is,\r\nparts of the mountain meadows where hay is made. The polonini are of\r\ngreat importance to the inhabitants of the mountains. Great herds of\r\nhorses, cattle and sheep remain here all summer. The polonini are\r\npeopled, and a life of great privation—a hard life but free—develops in\r\nprimitive dairy huts, with never dying camp-fires.\r\n\r\nIn the mountains of Crimea we find, in the main, the same arrangement\r\nof plant zones. At some height above sea-level the forest zone begins.\r\nWhite and red beech, oak, and two species of pine appear here in\r\nforests. Only on the broad peak surfaces we find poor mountain meadows\r\nwith thick but short grasses. The name of these mountain pastures\r\n(yaila) has been transferred to the entire mountain chain.\r\n\r\nIn the Caucasus we find, within Ukrainian territory, only the forest\r\nzone of this mountain system. The forests often attain a height of 2500\r\nm., and consist of various kinds of oak, beech, elms, linden, maple and\r\nash. Above the forest limit we meet with a low shrub formation and the\r\nbeautiful, wonderfully rich grass and herb growth which cover the\r\nmountain meadows of the Caucasus, rising, at a height of 2900–3500 m.,\r\nto the snow border.\r\n\r\nThe animal-geographical conditions of the Ukraine are much simpler than\r\nthe plant-geographical. The Ukraine, like the rest of Europe, belongs\r\nto the holarctic region, and despite the extent of the land, only\r\nslight differences in the fauna are found, these being due to the\r\nfloral and morphological differences of the mountains, forests and\r\nsteppes of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nSince the ice age, the animal world of the Ukraine has experienced no\r\nlesser changes than the plant world. In the ice period many mighty\r\nbeasts of prey (cave bear, cave lion, cave hyena, etc.) lived here,\r\nbesides thick-skinned animals (mammoth, rhinoceros), together with the\r\nancestors of the present animal world and various polar forms. All\r\nthese animals are either altogether extinct, or they followed the\r\nreceding glacier to the north. On the other hand, together with the\r\npost glacial steppe, a steppe-fauna spread out from south and east,\r\nwhich then gradually had to make way for the forest fauna advancing\r\nsouthward with the forests.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, the Ukrainian fauna suffered only very slight\r\nnatural changes. On the other hand, the artificial changes produced by\r\nthe hand of man have been all the greater. Many species which were\r\ndangerous as beasts of prey or useful for food or skins, have either\r\nbeen entirely exterminated by man or greatly limited in their spread.\r\nIn destroying the forests and putting cultivated steppes and fields in\r\ntheir place, he has, to a great extent, beaten the way to the heart of\r\nCentral Europe for the animals of the steppe. But his activity has been\r\nrather to exterminate than to change, and he has destroyed the once\r\nwonderful animal life of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nOf the higher animal life of the Ukraine on the middle and lower\r\nDnieper, we are told, in a historical source, almost incredible facts\r\nprevailing about the middle of the 16th Century. “The Ukraine is so\r\nrich in game that bisons, wild horses and deer are hunted merely for\r\nthe sake of their skins. Of their meat only the choicest cuts of chine\r\nand loin are used, all other parts thrown away. Hinds and young boars\r\nare not hunted at all. Roes and wild boars wander in great herds from\r\nthe steppes into the woods in winter, returning to the steppes in\r\nsummer. During this season they are killed by the thousands. On all the\r\nrivers, streamlets, brooks, live innumerable beaver colonies. The bird\r\nworld is so remarkably rich that enormous quantities of wild goose,\r\nwild duck, crane and swan eggs and young ones are gathered. In the\r\nrivers, such great shoals of fish swarm in the spring that the fishing\r\nspear thrown in stands upright.” Another chronicler, of the 17th\r\nCentury, tells that he was present when a single throw of the net at\r\nthe mouth of the Orel brought 2000 fish to light, of which the smallest\r\nwas one foot long.\r\n\r\nOf the cat family, the lynx and the wildcat have become very rare and\r\nare met with only in the Carpathians and the Caucasus; the lynx also in\r\nthe Polissye country. The bear, formerly very frequent thruout the\r\nUkraine, is now also confined to these three regions. On the other\r\nhand, wolves, foxes, badgers, martens, polecats and all sorts of small\r\nanimals of prey have survived, altho in very much smaller numbers. Of\r\nthe large plant-eating animals the bison (thanks only to the unusual\r\ncare on the part of the government) has survived in the primeval forest\r\nof Biloveza, the moose-deer only in the Polissye, the stag only in the\r\nCarpathians and the Caucasus. On the other hand, there are still a\r\ngreat many roes and wild boars in the woods. Of the rodents the hare is\r\nstill common everywhere, while the beaver, which at one time inhabited\r\nall the rivers of the Ukraine, is now confined to the most inaccessible\r\nswamps of the Polissye and the Caucasian tributaries of the Kuban. The\r\nbird kingdom, too, has become much poorer in species. Large birds of\r\nprey, like eagles and hawks, nest only in the Carpathians and in the\r\nCaucasus—very seldom in the woods of the plain. The heath fowl and\r\ngrouse seek the most inaccessible thickets, and even the number of\r\nsmall insect and grain-feeders has been greatly reduced. Of the\r\nwaterfowl, wild ducks, wild geese, coot, diving birds, etc., are still\r\nvery numerous. Cranes and herons are rare. The former wealth of fish is\r\nruined and no one takes care of the artificial raising of fish. To be\r\nsure, much fish is still caught, especially in the Dnieper and Don\r\nsystems, mainly pike, tench, carp, crucian, shad, etc., and trout in\r\nthe mountain streams; but of the abundance of even the comparatively\r\nrecent past, there is no trace. Sturgeon, sterlet and other sea fish,\r\nwhich formerly came in great swarms up the Dniester, Boh and Dnieper,\r\nare only seldom found today.\r\n\r\nThe steppe region has lost even more of its animal wealth. Above all,\r\nthe rich higher animal life of the transition zones, which as late as\r\nthe 18th Century provided food for the populous Zaporog Sich, has quite\r\ndisappeared. The tarpani (wild horses), which still inhabited the\r\nsteppe in great herds in the 17th Century, are now completely\r\nexterminated. Saiga antelopes (saihaki), once generally distributed\r\nthruout the steppe region of the Ukraine, have retreated to the Caspian\r\nsteppe. The smaller game and the bird world have suffered far less, but\r\nthe activity of man, who has changed the steppes into fields and\r\npastures, has been fatal to them too. The bustard, sandpiper, partridge\r\nand grouse, which formerly inhabited the steppe brush in great numbers\r\nhave become rare. The same may be said of the bird-world of the\r\nwatercourses and swamps which once inhabited the river districts of the\r\nsteppe in immense swarms. The insectivorous birds, too, have decreased,\r\nand the harmful insects are increasing at a terrible rate. Only the\r\nlocust pest, which formerly caused great damage in agriculture, is now\r\nalmost gone.\r\n\r\nBut, in spite of the war of extermination which man is waging against\r\nthe animal world of the steppe, animal species are found which were\r\nwell able to adapt themselves to the new circumstances, have become\r\naccustomed to man and have found plenty of food in the fields of the\r\ncultivated steppe (field-mice, marmot, ground squirrels, etc.). They\r\nhave increased greatly and have migrated toward the west and north,\r\ncausing great damage to farming.\r\n\r\nAs we must dispense with a scientific discussion of the flora and fauna\r\nof the Ukraine, we shall only report a few essential facts about the\r\nuseful plants and domestic animals.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine, according to its soil and its climate, is the richest\r\ngrain country of Europe. For wheat the conditions in the Ukraine are\r\nthe most favorable, especially in the southern half of the black-earth\r\nregion. Rye is raised more widely in the north and northwest; barley\r\neverywhere, but on a large scale only in the south; oats in the north\r\nand in the Carpathians, where it is often used to make bread. Buckwheat\r\nis distributed chiefly on the northern edge of the black-earth region;\r\nmillet thrives well in the entire Chornozyom region. Corn is raised on\r\na large scale only in the southwest and in the sub-Caucasus country.\r\n\r\nOf pod plants, peas and beans are especially imported; they are raised\r\nnot only in vegetable gardens but also in fields. Of the tuberous\r\nplants, the potato is generally distributed only in the western part of\r\nthe Ukraine and increases in importance but slowly in the rest of the\r\ncountry. Sugar beets are cultivated on great areas of the Volhynian,\r\nPodolian and Dnieper Plateaus. Vegetable culture embraces all the\r\nvegetables of Central Europe, but is not especially developed. On the\r\nother hand, water melons, cantaloupe, cucumbers (particularly in the\r\nSouthern Ukraine) are raised in special plantations (bashtani). Hemp,\r\nflax, rape-seed, sunflower, are generally distributed, and poppy is\r\ncultivated not only in gardens but also in fields. Tobacco culture is\r\nvery important in the Ukraine, particularly in the Dnieper Plain.\r\n\r\nThanks to the warm summer and fall, the Ukrainian climate is well\r\nfitted for fruit culture. The orchard is a necessity to the Ukrainian\r\nfarmer and is planted and cared for even under difficult conditions.\r\nFruit culture flourishes particularly in Pokutye, Podolia (where the\r\nmore tender species of apple and pear, as well as apricots, thrive in\r\nthe Dniester valley), in Bessarabia, in Crimea and the sub-Caucasus\r\ncountry, where even peaches and grapes are added. The northern limit of\r\nthe vine extends along the Dniester, then thru Kamenetz and\r\nKaterinoslav to the bend of the Don. Wine-culture has its main regions\r\nin Bessarabia, in Crimea and in the sub-Caucasus country, altho South\r\nPodolia and the Dnieper valley in the old Zaporog country do not lack\r\nvineyards.\r\n\r\nThe domestic animals are the same in the Ukraine as in Central Europe.\r\nOnly in the extreme south camels and buffaloes are added. The horned\r\ncattle belong chiefly to the so-called Ukrainian breed, which is\r\ndistinguished by its gray color and its size, and is bony and\r\nstrong-limbed. It is very well fitted for work and is rich in milk. On\r\nthe southwest borders of the Ukraine the Hungarian great-horned breed\r\nis widely distributed. In recent times the pure Holland, Tirol and\r\nSwiss breeds are continually spreading. The horses of the Ukraine\r\nbelong to various mixed breeds. The most beautiful breed of horses, the\r\nUkrainian, has been raised by the Zaporog Cossacks. It is of medium\r\nsize, very strong and fleet, very enduring and useful for any sort of\r\nwork. The Chornomoric variety is now being raised by the Kuban Cossacks\r\nand is rightfully famed thruout Eastern Europe for its high qualities.\r\nVery efficient, too, is the Hutzulian breed of mountain horses, small\r\nof stature but very strong, unsurpassed for mountain roads and\r\nfoot-ways. The peasant horses of Galicia, Volhynia, etc., are, despite\r\ntheir unseemly outward appearance, really created for the rough roads\r\nof their land.\r\n\r\nDonkeys and mules are rarities in the Ukraine, also very few goats are\r\nkept. In sheep, however, the Ukraine is the richest country in Europe.\r\nNot only native breeds (among them the justly famous reshetilivka, as\r\nit is called), but also foreign merino sheep are raised, especially in\r\nthe steppes of the Ukraine. Hog raising is very highly developed.\r\nUsually Polish hogs are raised in Western Ukraine, Russian short-eared\r\nhogs in the eastern part, and in Southern Ukraine, southern crinkled\r\nhogs. In barnyard fowl the Ukraine is the richest land in Eastern\r\nEurope. Also bee culture is very important, especially in the Dnieper\r\nPlain. Silkworm culture, however, is not very important, altho the\r\nmulberry trees find favorable climatic conditions thruout the Ukraine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nANTHROPOGEOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nETHNOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF UKRAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF UKRAINIANS\r\n\r\nTo give the ethnographic boundaries of a Western or Central European\r\nnation is very easy, for they have long since been determined and\r\ninvestigated, and it would be hard to find anyone who might try to\r\nefface or disregard them, least of all to falsify them. But with the\r\nUkrainians it is quite different. They possess neither political\r\nindependence, as for example, the Germans, French, Italians, etc., nor\r\npolitical influence, as for instance, the Poles and Czechs in Austria.\r\nThe Ukrainians inhabit parts of two states, Austria-Hungary and Russia,\r\nand have some political significance in the former, while in the latter\r\nthey are not even recognized as a racial entity.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the real boundaries of the National territory of the\r\nUkraine are insufficiently known. They are best known within Austrian\r\nterritory, altho the statistics, especially those of Galicia, are very\r\npoor. Even less exact in respect to the distribution of the Ukrainians\r\nare the Hungarian statistics. In Russia the condition is worst of all.\r\nThe first real census here was taken on January 28, 1897. All earlier\r\ncalculations and estimates are of very questionable worth. For\r\ninstance, all the Pinchuks, the Ukrainian inhabitants of the Polissye,\r\nhave been erroneously counted with the White Russians, the Ukrainians\r\nin the vicinity of Mhilin and Starodub with the Great Russians.\r\nBesides, very many Ukrainians were registered under the general heading\r\nof “Russians.”\r\n\r\nFor this reason, it is impossible at the present time to give the\r\nboundaries of the Ukrainian racial territory as exactly as those of the\r\nWestern and Central European countries. The boundaries here given,\r\nhowever, are drawn from official statistical sources, and only very\r\nconspicuous and generally acknowledged errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\nThe western boundary of the compact Ukrainian national territory begins\r\non the shores of the Black Sea at the delta of the Danube, where part\r\nof the descendants of the Zaporogs are still devoted to their\r\ntraditional vocation of fishing. Here the neighbors of the Ukrainians\r\nare the Roumanians and Bulgarians. The Ukrainian-Roumanian boundary\r\nline then goes thru Bessarabia, Bukowina, and Northeastern Hungary.\r\n\r\nIn Bessarabia the border passes thru Ismail, Bilhorod, the mouth of the\r\nDniester at its liman, then up the Dniester to Dubosari, running in\r\nadventurous windings past Orhiev and Bilzi until it reaches the\r\nPrut-Dniester divide, and leaving this province near Novoselitza.\r\nInnumerable ethnographic islands lie on both sides of this boundary;\r\nRoumanians on Ukrainian territory and Ukrainians on Roumanian\r\nterritory. Only within the past centuries has the land been settled\r\nmore thickly and the main body of Roumanians has been so dotted with\r\nthis medley of races as to form a veritable ethnographic mosaic.\r\n\r\nIn the Bukowina, the boundary of the Ukrainian territory, running along\r\nthe national border at first, reaches the cities of Sereth and\r\nRadivtzi. Then it turns with a sharp bend to Chernivtzi and passes in a\r\nwide curve toward the southwest and west, thru Storozhinetz, Vikiv,\r\nMoldavitsia and Kirlibaba to the White Cheremosh, where it extends over\r\ninto Hungary. In the Bukowina, too, the ethnographic boundary of the\r\nUkrainians is not of great antiquity (the Cheremosh region excluded).\r\n\r\nThe boundary is all the older in Hungary, for the Ukrainian people have\r\nhad a place here since the early middle ages. This boundary extends\r\nalong the Visheva, and then the Tissa, past Sihot to Vishkiv. At this\r\nplace the border crosses to the left bank of the river and, passing\r\nalong the Gutin Mountain Ridge, reaches the river Tur near Polad. Here\r\nthe Roumanian-Ukrainian boundary ends and the neighboring country of\r\nthe Magyars begins.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of Ukrainian territory here runs in a generally northeast\r\ndirection, touching Uylak, Beregszasz, Mukachiv (Munkacs), Uzhorod\r\n(Unghvar), Bardiiv (Bartfa), Sabiniv (Kis Szeben), Kesmark. At Lublau\r\nthe boundary crosses the Poprad River and reaches Galicia. Between\r\nUnghvar and Bartfeld, the Slovaks become the neighbors of the\r\nUkrainians. The boundary between Slovaks and Ukrainians is very\r\nindistinct, and only the investigations of Hnatiúk and Tomashivsky have\r\nsucceeded in determining it and in proving that thru the centuries the\r\nborders of Ukrainian territory have been subject to comparatively\r\nslight changes.\r\n\r\nIn Galicia, the Ukrainians are neighbors to the Poles. The Polish rule\r\nof over 500 years’ duration, has forced the Ukrainian element eastward\r\nto a great extent into the hill country and the plain. Only in the\r\nmountains has the Ukrainian element preserved itself and the Ukrainian\r\nterritory here forms a peninsula extending far to the west.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian-Polish boundary in Galicia begins at the village of\r\nShlakhtova, west of the Poprad Pass, and extends eastward, touching the\r\nsmall towns of Pivnichna, Hribov, Horlitzi, Zmigrod, Dukla, Rimanov,\r\nZarshin, as far as Sianik, whence it follows the general direction of\r\nthe San as far as Dubetzco. Here it turns toward the northeast, reaches\r\nthe San River again near Radimno, and runs along the left shore past\r\nYaroslav, Siniava, Lezaisk, reaching Russian-Poland at Tarnogrod.\r\n\r\nIn Russian Poland, the Ukrainians inhabit the newly-created Government\r\nof Kholm, and for five centuries they have had to ward off the eastward\r\nexpansion of the Poles. Nevertheless, the Polonizing of the country\r\nbegan to progress under Russian rule, as a result of the inconsiderate\r\nRussification policy of the authorities and the sympathy of the\r\nUkrainian population with the Greek-Catholic faith, ruthlessly\r\nsuppressed by the Russians, to which the Ukrainians of the Kholm\r\ncountry still belonged half a century ago, a sympathy which is not yet\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nThe boundary line between Poles and Ukrainians in the Kholm country\r\nhas, on both sides, a more or less wide zone of a mixed population and\r\nnumerous ethnographic islands. It passes thru Tarnogrod, Bilhoray,\r\nShteshebreshin, Zamostye, Krasnostav, Lubartiv, Radin, Lukiv, Sokoliv,\r\nDorohichin and Bilsk, reaching the Narev River in the Government of\r\nGrodno. Here the borders of the Ukrainian and the Polish national\r\nterritory meet the White Russian border and the northern border of the\r\nUkraine begins.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian-White Russian boundary extends thru the Governments of\r\nGrodno and Minsk, at first along the Narev River, up to its source in\r\nthe Biloveza Forest. Then the line passes Pruzani over to the Yassiolda\r\nRiver, turning off near Poriche toward the northeast and reaching the\r\nlake of Vihonivske Ozero. From here it turns toward the southeast and\r\nreaches the Pripet River at the mouth of the Zna. Then this river forms\r\nthe boundary up to where it joins with the Dnieper. Only below Mosir\r\nthe White Russians push forward in an obtuse salient to the right bank\r\nof the Pripet. It should be observed that the White Russians along the\r\nboundary described form a transition in respect to language and\r\nethnology between the real White Russians and the real Ukrainians, who,\r\nin this region, are called Pinchuki. The transition zone is 30 to 50\r\nkilometers in width.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper forms the boundary of the Ukraine only along a short\r\nstretch in the Government of Chernihiv, from the mouth of the Pripet to\r\nthe mouth of the Sol near Loüv. Then the border runs northeast past\r\nNovosibkiv, Nove misto and Suraz, as far as Mhlin, where the White\r\nRussian country ceases and the Russian begins.\r\n\r\nTo sketch accurately the boundary of the Ukraine toward Muscovy is not\r\neasy, even tho there is by no means a gradual transition here, as there\r\nis on the White Russian border. The boundary of the Ukraine is even\r\nmuch more sharply defined here than in the region where it separates\r\nthe Ukrainians from the Poles, Roumanians and Magyars. But it is hard\r\nto determine without detailed investigation on the spot, for the\r\nofficial Russian statistics have been compiled very much in favor of\r\nthe ruling race. In addition, it must be observed that the districts\r\nalong this border were not thickly settled until the 17th and 18th\r\nCenturies. The settlers came from the Ukraine on the one side and from\r\nMuscovy on the other, and established themselves in separate\r\nsettlements. To this day a purely Ukrainian village or small town often\r\nborders on one made up entirely of Russians, and the number of\r\nethnographic islands is rather large on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of the compact Ukrainian territory in the Governments of\r\nKursk and Voronizh passes thru Putivil, Rilsk, Sudza, Miropilia,\r\nOboian, the sources of the Psiol, and Vorskla, Bilhorod, Korocha, Stari\r\nOskol, Novi Oskol, and Biriuch, and reaches the Don River near\r\nOstrohosk. The Don forms a smaller part of the border of the Ukraine\r\nthan the Dnieper. The boundary line leaves the river at the mouth of\r\nthe Icorez, cuts the Bitiuh River and, passing Baturlinivka and\r\nNovokhopersk, reaches the Khoper River in the country of the Don\r\nCossacks. Here begins the eastern boundary of the Ukrainian country. It\r\nextends first along the Khoper River southward, crosses the Don\r\nperpendicularly at the mouth of the Khoper, passes along the Kalitva\r\nand the Donetz, crossing the Don for the third time near Novocherkask,\r\nand, pursuing a wide curve along the Sal River, reaches Lake Manich.\r\nRight opposite, on the left bank of the Don, the Ukrainians confront\r\nthe Kalmucks, the advance guard of the sub-Caucasian and Caucasian\r\nmedley of races. Among these thinly scattered and culturally inferior\r\ntribes, a strong flood of Ukrainian and Russian colonization has been\r\npouring in the course of the past century. The Ukrainian element is\r\ngradually predominating in the entire region of Ciscaucasia and is\r\nconstantly pushing forward toward the east and southeast. New islands\r\nof Ukrainian-speaking people are forming and are growing constantly and\r\nuniting to form larger complexes.\r\n\r\nFrom Lake Manich, the border of the Ukraine country runs southward thru\r\nthe district of Medveza of the Government of Stavropol, as far as the\r\nsources of the great Yahorlik. Then it turns eastward past Stavropol,\r\nAlexandrivsk and Novohrihoryvsk. In a narrow strip the Ukrainians here\r\nreach the Caspian Sea. It was only suggested in the census of 1897, but\r\nproved beyond doubt by the reports of the new settlements of the\r\nUkrainian element in these regions, that the Ukrainian area here shows\r\na great increase.\r\n\r\nThe southern boundary of the Ukraine in the Caucasian lands passes thru\r\nthe Terek, Kuban and Black Sea Governments by way of Nalchic,\r\nPiatihorsk, Labinsk and Maikop, reaching the shore of the Black Sea\r\nbetween Tuapse and Sochi. In this region the Ukrainians have as\r\nneighbors besides the Russians, the Kalmucks, Kirgizians, Norgaians,\r\nChechenians, Cabardines, Circassians, Abkhasians and Caucasian Tartars.\r\n\r\nThe further course of the southern border of the Ukraine, as far as the\r\ndelta of the Danube, is indicated on the whole by the coasts of the\r\nBlack Sea and the Sea of Azof. Only Crimea has, until recently,\r\nremained outside the ethnographic confines of the Ukraine. To the\r\nextent that the Crimean Tartars have begun to emigrate to Turkey,\r\nhowever, the Ukrainian element has gained strength thru constant\r\nreinforcements from the Central Ukrainian districts, so that today only\r\nthe mountain region and the south coast of Crimea are considered Tartar\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThese boundaries enclose the compact country which is inhabited by the\r\nUkrainians. This country includes North and West Bukowina, Northeastern\r\nHungary, East Galicia and the southwestern part of West Galicia, the\r\nnewly-created Government of Kholm (the eastern districts of the\r\nGovernments of Lublin and Sidlez in Russian Poland), the southern part\r\nof Grodno and Minsk, all of Volhynia, Podolia, Kiev and Kherson,\r\nbesides the southeastern and northwestern districts of Bessarabia. To\r\nthe left of the Dnieper, the borders of the Ukraine include the\r\nGovernments of Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, Katerinoslav, Tauria (with\r\nthe exception of the Yaila) and the entire Kuban region, the chains of\r\nhigh mountains excepted. In addition, the following belong to the\r\nterritory of Ukraine: The southern third of the Government of Kursk,\r\nthe southern half of Voroniz, the western third of the Don Cossack\r\ncountry, the southern half of Stavropol, the northern border of the\r\nTerek region, and, finally, the northwestern part of the Government of\r\nthe Black Sea. For Europe it is a very spacious territory, being second\r\nin size only to the Russian (Muscovite) national territory. The area of\r\nthe Ukrainian national territory is 850,000 square kilometers, of which\r\nonly 75,000 square kilometers lie within the borders of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy, the remaining country of 775,000 square\r\nkilometers being subject to Russian rule.\r\n\r\nBeyond this compact Ukrainian national territory, the Ukrainians live\r\nin numerous great homogeneous patches, scattered over wide areas of the\r\nOld and New Worlds. In Bessarabia we meet with a whole series of these\r\nUkrainian language areas or islands along the Prut River and the\r\nRussian-Roumanian boundary, in the Roumanian Dobrudja, and in the delta\r\nof the Danube. In the Bukowina there are Ukrainian language islands at\r\nSuchava and Kimpolung, in Hungary in the Backza, at Nyregihatza,\r\nNagi-Caroli, Göllnitz, etc., in the Kholm country between Lukov and\r\nZelekhov, between Sidletz and Kaluszin, and near Sokolov. Along the\r\nWhite Russian border, where the transition is gradual, no real language\r\nislands are found in the intervening zone before mentioned. We find all\r\nthe more of them in Ukrainian-Russian borderlands, where the two\r\nnationalities are very sharply separated and there are no transitions.\r\nIn the Government of Kursk we find a whole chain of well-defined\r\nUkrainian language islands in the midst of the Russian territory; at\r\nFatiez, between Dmitriev and Oboian, and also at the sources of the\r\nSem. In the Government of Voroniz there are several language islands at\r\nSiemlansk and Borisoglebsk. A few scattered Ukrainian settlements\r\nextend to the district of Tambov and Yelez. The Don country, for a long\r\ntime practically closed to settlers because of its Cossack\r\norganization, was a valuable thoroughfare for the Ukrainian\r\ncolonization movement in its expansion in the central Volga district.\r\nHere there lived (1910) over 600,000 Ukrainians in the Governments of\r\nSaratov, Samara and Astrakhan. Here lie, in closest proximity to\r\nnumerous German colonies, great Ukrainian language islands, near\r\nBalashov, Atkarsk, Balanda, on the Eman and Medveditza, at Nikolaievsk,\r\nKhvalinsk, Samara and Boguruslan. From Khvalinsk on, the Ukrainian\r\ncolonies on the left bank of the Volga take up as much space as the\r\nRussian. We find the Ukrainian colonies here opposite Saratov,\r\nKamishin, Dubivka, Chorni Yar, and at Zarev. Besides these there are,\r\nat a greater distance from the Volga, Ukrainian language islands in the\r\ncountry around the source of the Yeruslan and the Great Usen, on Lakes\r\nElton and Baskunchak, on the Ilovla and the Yergeni hills. In the\r\nOrenburg Government, on the Ural River, more than 50,000 Ukrainian\r\ncolonists now dwell. In general, the Ukrainians in the year of 1897\r\ncomprised 13% of the population of the Government of Astrakhan\r\n(District of Zarev 38%, Chornoyar 43%), more than 7% in the Government\r\nof Saratov, nearly 5% in Samara. At present, considering the active\r\nUkrainian colonization of the past decades, these percentages must be\r\nmuch greater.\r\n\r\nIn the Caucasus lands we likewise find a goodly number of Ukrainian\r\nColonies. According to the results of the census of 1897 the Ukrainians\r\ncomprised 17 to 19% of the “Russian” population in the Governments of\r\nErivan, Kutais, Daghestan and Kars, 7,5% in Tiflis and 5% in\r\nYelisavetpol and in Baku each.\r\n\r\nThru the Volga and Caucasus lands, the tide of Ukrainian emigrants\r\nreached Russian Central Asia. The establishment of Ukrainian\r\nsettlements in this region only began toward the end of the past\r\ncentury and has continued to this day. In the year 1897 the Ukrainians\r\nalready comprised 29% of the “Russian” population in the province of\r\nSir Daria and 23% in the province of Akmolinsk. In the Provinces of\r\nTranskaspia, Siemiriechensk, Turgai, Samarkand and Ferghana, the\r\nUkrainians comprised 10% to 20% of the “Russian” population; in the\r\nProvince of Siemipalatinsk, 5%.\r\n\r\nBut Ukrainian colonization in Siberia appears on the largest scale of\r\nall. In a long line of thousands of kilometers, Ukrainian language\r\nislands and detached colonies stretch along the southern border of this\r\nland of tomorrow. The highest percentages of Ukrainians are found among\r\nthe “Russian” population of the coast province near Vladivostok (over\r\n29%) and the Province of Amur (over 20%), the greatest absolute numbers\r\nin the southern districts of the Governments of Tomsk, Tobolsk and\r\nYeniseysk.\r\n\r\nBesides these colonies and language islands in Eurasia, we find\r\nsettlements of considerable size in America. More than half a million\r\nUkrainians are scattered in small groups over the spacious area of the\r\nUnited States. They are, for the most part, mine and factory workers,\r\nwho usually return, with the earnings they have saved, to their\r\nfatherland. Pennsylvania is especially rich in Ukrainian emigrants, who\r\nsometimes take root here, but usually lose their nationality in the\r\nsecond generation. Agricultural colonies have been established by the\r\nUkrainians in Canada. Here we find Ukrainian language islands of some\r\nsize in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and smaller groups of\r\nsettlements in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. The number of the\r\nUkrainians in Canada exceeds 200,000, and the steady character and\r\ncompactness of the settlements preserve the Ukrainian element from\r\nrapid denationalization. The same kind of agricultural colonies have\r\nbeen established by the Ukrainian peasants in Brazil. They are located\r\nchiefly in the State of Parana, also in detached groups in Rio Grande\r\ndo Sul, Santa Catarina and São Paulo, as well as in the adjacent lands\r\nof Argentina. These rapidly increasing settlers, about 60,000 in\r\nnumber, form an important cultural element here among the indolent\r\nLuso-Brazilians.\r\n\r\nBut we do not desire, in this small work, to write a geography of the\r\nUkrainian colonies. All are branches severed from the mother-tree,\r\nwhich, considering the low grade of culture of the settlers, must\r\nsooner or later be assimilated by the foreign race. Only the Asiatic\r\ncolonies have some (though rather slight) prospects of preserving their\r\nnational individuality into the remote future. The constant addition of\r\nnew arrivals from the home country, as well as the higher culture of\r\nthe Ukrainian people as opposed to the Russian masses, will preserve\r\nthe Ukrainian colonists in Asia from rapid denationalization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the total number of Ukrainians, and how many of them live in\r\nthe compact Ukrainian national territory?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is not easy—for the same reasons which do\r\nnot permit us to draw accurately the boundaries of the Ukrainian\r\ncountry. The political subjugation of the Ukraine on the one hand, and\r\nthe size of the nation and its territory on the other, cause the ruling\r\ngovernments to falsify the statistics, thus concealing the true state\r\nof affairs. To a great extent, also, the ignorance of the organs\r\nperforming the census bear the blame for the unreliability of the\r\nstatistics collected in Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainians are either\r\nsimply registered as members of another (usually the ruling)\r\nnationality, or forced, by various means, to deny their inherited\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary entire villages are sometimes set down as Magyar, Slovak or\r\nRoumanian, altho their population is wholly, or for the most part,\r\nUkrainian. In the Bukowina, too, a great many Ukrainians are registered\r\nas Roumanians. In Galicia, all Roman-Catholic Ukrainians are regularly\r\nentered as Poles, altho, as a rule, they have not even a mastery of the\r\nPolish language. Nevertheless, the Austro-Hungarian statistics allow\r\nthe possibility of determining very closely the true condition. The\r\nRussian census of 1897, which gives us the sole materials for\r\nstatistics on a racial basis in the Ukraine, was carried out greatly to\r\nthe disadvantage of the Ukrainian element. In the cities, only the\r\nsmallest minority of the Ukrainians are registered as such, all the\r\nrest being counted as Russians. The same has been the case in all the\r\nUkrainian colonies and language islands scattered thru the great space\r\nof the gigantic Russian Empire. Even so, we are omitting from\r\nconsideration those Ukrainians who, because of lack of national\r\nconsciousness or for fear of persecution, have denied their\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nDespite all these shortcomings of the official statistics, we shall\r\nmake their statements the basis of our calculations. Only the most\r\nmarked falsifications or errors can be considered and corrected. As the\r\nbasis of our calculations, we shall take the figures of the census in\r\nAustria and Hungary of the year 1910, as well as the Russian\r\ncalculations of the same year. As the latter lack any statement as to\r\nthe relative proportions or percentages of the nationalities, we must\r\napply the percentages of the enumeration of 1897 to the totals of 1910.\r\nThis process, of course, gives us only approximate values, but it is\r\nthe only available method.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin our statistical view of the Ukrainian lands with\r\nNortheastern Hungary. Here the Ukrainians inhabit a compact territory\r\nof over 14,000 square kilometers. The greatest part of it lies in the\r\nCarpathian Mountains and includes the northern three-quarters of the\r\nCounty of Marmarosh, the northeastern half of the County of Ungh, the\r\nnorthern borderlands of the Counties of Semplen and Sharosh, and the\r\nnortheastern borderlands of the County of Zips. The total number of\r\nUkrainians in Hungary was 470,000 in 1910, a number which, because of\r\nthe insufficient Hungarian statistics, may be confidently raised to a\r\nhalf a million, if we consider the fact that even the doctored\r\nGreek-Catholic figures of the eighties gave approximately the latter\r\nnumber. The percentages of the Ukrainians in different counties,\r\naccording to official reckoning, are as follows: In Marmorosh 46%,\r\nUhocha 39%, Bereg 46%, Ungh 36%, Sharosh 20%, Semplen 11%, Zips 8%. In\r\nthe east the Roumanians form small scattered language islands, in the\r\nwest the Slovaks. Amid the Ukrainian population, scattered, but in\r\nconsiderable numbers, live Jews; in the cities, Magyars and Germans\r\nbesides. The Ukrainians inhabit all the mountainous, sparsely settled\r\nparts of the counties, hence the percentage of them is small, despite\r\nthe extent of the country they inhabit. The Ukrainian people in Upper\r\nHungary consist almost exclusively of peasants and petty bourgeois. The\r\nlack of national schools causes illiteracy to grow rampant. The upper\r\nstrata of the people are three-fourths denationalized; the common\r\npeople are stifled in ignorance, and in the consequent poor economic\r\nconditions, which the Hungarian Government is vainly trying to relieve.\r\n\r\nIn the Bukowina the Ukrainians, over 300,000 in number (38% of the\r\ntotal population of the land), inhabit a region of 5000 square\r\nkilometers, situated mostly in the mountainous parts of the country.\r\nThe Ukrainians inhabit the following districts: Zastavna (80%),\r\nVashkivtzi (83%), Viznitza (78%), Kitzman (87%), and Chernivtzi (55%),\r\nhalf the District of Sereth (42%), a third of the District of\r\nStorozhinetz (26%), besides parts of the Districts of Kimpolung,\r\nRadautz and Suchava. Amid the Ukrainian population a great many Jews\r\nare settled, scattered, and in the cities many Germans, Roumanians,\r\nArmenians and Poles besides. The degree of education and the economic\r\nstate of the Bukowina Ukrainians are incomparably better than those of\r\nthe Ukrainians of Hungary. From the rural population a numerous\r\neducated class has sprung, which has taken the lead of the masses in\r\nthe economic and political struggle.\r\n\r\nIn Galicia (78,500 square kilometers, 8 million inhabitants) the\r\nUkrainians, 3,210,000, that is 40% of the total population (with 59% of\r\nPoles and 1% of Germans) occupy a compact space of 56,000 square\r\nkilometers, in which they comprise 59% of the population. These figures\r\nare taken from the census of the year 1910, which, because of its\r\npartisan compilation, is perhaps unique among the civilized states of\r\nEurope. For not only are all the Jews (who speak a German jargon)\r\nlisted as Poles, but also all the Ukrainians of Roman-Catholic faith,\r\nof whom there is more than half a million, and 170,000 pure Ukrainians\r\nof Greek-Catholic (united) faith. Basing our calculations, not on these\r\nstatistics of the vernacular, but on the statistics of faith, which,\r\ntoo, are not unobjectionable, we obtain the following results: For the\r\nGreek-Catholic Ukrainians 3,380,000 (42%), for the Roman-Catholic Poles\r\n3,730,000 (47%), and for the Jews 870,000 (11%). According to religious\r\nconvictions, then, Ukrainian East Galicia would contain 62% of\r\nUkrainians, over 25% (1,350,000) Poles, and over 12% (660,000) Jews. As\r\na matter of fact, the number of Ukrainians in Galicia, according to the\r\ninvestigations of Dr. Okhrimovich, should be raised to at least\r\n3,500,000, and, adding the Roman-Catholic Ukrainians of East Galicia,\r\nthe number is 4,000,000. We shall retain the figure 3,380,000, however,\r\nbut for the following view of the districts, the percentages will be\r\ntaken from the much more justly compiled census of the year 1900. The\r\ngreatest percentage of the Ukrainian population, that is 75–90%, is\r\nfound in the Carpathian Districts of Turka, Stari Sambir, Kossiv,\r\nPechenizin; the sub-Carpathian Districts of Bohorodchani, Kalush,\r\nZidachiv; the Pocutian Districts of Sniatin and Horodenka, besides the\r\nDistrict of Yavoriv in the Rostoche. The percentage of Ukrainians\r\nvacillates between 67 and 75% in the Districts of Lisko, Dobromil,\r\nStriy, Dolina, Nadvirna, Tovmach, Salishchiki, Borshchiv, Rohatin,\r\nBibrka, Zovkva and Rava. More than three-fifths of the population\r\n(60–66%) is made up of Ukrainians in the Districts of Drohobich,\r\nSambir, Rudki, Mostiska, Horodok, Kolomiya, Sokal, Kaminka, Brody,\r\nSbaraz Zolochiv, Peremishlani, Berezani, Pidhaytzi, Chorytkiv, and\r\nHusiatin; 50–60% Ukrainians are found in the Districts of Chesaniv,\r\nPeremishl, Sianik, Ternopil, Skalat, Terebovla, Buchach and\r\nStanislaviv. In only two districts the percentage of Ukrainians falls\r\nbelow 50%: in the districts of Lemberg (49%) and Yaroslav (41%). In the\r\ncity of Lemberg the Ukrainians comprise only one-fifth of the\r\npopulation, and in other larger cities of East Galicia, too, their\r\npercentage is not great. Consequently, the total percentages of the\r\nUkrainians in the districts are influenced very unfavorably thru the\r\naddition of the city population. Besides, the East Galician cities,\r\ninhabited chiefly by Jews and Poles, are the chief centers of the\r\nPolonizing efforts. Only in the most recent times is the percentage of\r\nUkrainians in the larger cities of East Galicia becoming greater, as a\r\nresult of the continued flocking in of the Ukrainian rural population.\r\nIn the fifty smaller cities of East Galicia, on the other hand, the\r\nUkrainians comprise absolute majorities, e.g., Yavoriv, Horodenka,\r\nTismenitza.\r\n\r\nIn West Galicia only the District of Horlitzi (Gorlice) has more than\r\n25% Ukrainians, the remaining four (Yaslo, New Sandetz, Krosno, Hribov)\r\nonly 10–20%.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian population of Galicia consists nine-tenths of peasants\r\nand petty bourgeois. From them a numerous educated class has sprung in\r\nthe past century, which has taken the political and cultural leadership\r\nof the masses. For this reason, too, national consciousness has\r\nadvanced most among the Ukrainians of Galicia.\r\n\r\nIn the compass of the Russian State the Ukrainians occupy a compact\r\nnational territory of almost 775,000 square kilometers. The actual size\r\nof this territory will be accurately determined only when we possess an\r\naccurate ethnographic map of the Ukraine. Until then the size of the\r\nvarious Ukrainian sections can only be estimated.\r\n\r\nThe following statistical information is taken from the calculation of\r\n1910, the percentage of Ukrainians from the Russian census of 1897. But\r\nthe Pinchuks, in the Government of Minsk, were counted as belonging to\r\nthe Ukrainians by the common opinion of all Russian and non-Russian\r\nethnographers, altho the official statistics have designated them as\r\nWhite Russian.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin at the western border region, at the Kholmshchina (Kholm\r\nland), which was recently organized by the Russian Government as an\r\nindependent Government apart from Russian Poland, and includes the\r\neastern areas of the Governments of Lublin and Sidletz. In the\r\nGovernment of Lublin (16,800 square kilometers, 1,500,000 inhabitants)\r\nthe Ukrainians comprise 17% of the population (250,000), in the\r\nGovernment of Sidletz 14% (140,000). The region inhabited by the\r\nUkrainians in both Governments together, amounts to 10,000 square\r\nkilometers. Poles and Jews inhabit not only the cities in the Kholm\r\ncountry, but to a great extent villages as well, and comprise a\r\nconsiderable percentage of the population near the western border of\r\nthe Ukraine. The percentage figures of the Ukrainians and Poles (in\r\nparentheses) are in the various districts of the Government of Lublin:\r\nHrubeshiv 66 (24), Tomashiv 52 (37), Kholm 38 (38), Bilhoray 22 (68),\r\nZamostye 9 (83), Krasnostav 6 (83); in the districts of the Government\r\nof Sidletz: Vlodava 64 (20), Bila 48 (38), Konstantiniv 22 (55), Radin\r\n5 (87). In these districts the Jews comprise 5–13% of the population,\r\nthe Germans 14% in the District of Kholm. The number of Ukrainians in\r\nthe generally Polish-Jewish cities is not insignificant, even\r\ncomprising the absolute majority in Hrubeshiv.\r\n\r\nIn the Government of Grodno (38,600 square kilometers 1,950,000\r\ninhabitants), the Ukrainians comprise 23% of the population and inhabit\r\nthe districts of Berestia (81% Ukrainians), Kobrin (83%), Bilsk (42%\r\nrelative majority), and the border of Pruzani (7%), altogether 14,000\r\nsquare kilometers, with a Ukrainian population of 440,000. The Poles\r\nand White Russians comprise 2–3% in the first two of these districts,\r\nthe Poles 37% in the District of Bilsk, the White Russians 79% in\r\nPruzani, the Jews 9–11% in all districts.\r\n\r\nIn the Government of Minsk (91,000 square kilometers, 2,800,000\r\ninhabitants), the Ukrainians (Pinchuks) comprise 14% of the population.\r\nThey inhabit the entire District of Pinsk and the half of the District\r\nof Mosiv, situated on the right bank of the Pripet River, altogether\r\n17,000 square kilometers, with a Ukrainian population of 390,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Volhynia (71,700 square kilometers, 3,850,000\r\ninhabitants) is a central Ukrainian region. The Ukrainians (2,700,000)\r\nhere comprise over 70% of the population, the Jews 13%, the Poles over\r\n6%, the Germans about 6%, the Russians 3%, the Czechs 1%. These foreign\r\npeoples live scattered, or as colonists, and chiefly in the cities of\r\nVolhynia, in all of which (Kremianetz excepted) they are more numerous\r\nthan the Ukrainians. In the country it is different. The percentages of\r\nUkrainians in the districts of Volhynia are very high: Kovel 86%,\r\nOvruch 87%, Ostroh 85%, Zaslav 82%, Kremianetz 84%, Starokonstantiniv\r\n80%. Somewhat smaller are the percentages in the following districts:\r\nZitomir 73%, Dubno 73%, Volodimir Volinsky 68%, Rivne 65%, Lutzk 62%.\r\n\r\nIn the Government of Kiev (51,000 square kilometers, 4,570,000\r\ninhabitants) the Ukrainians comprise over 79% (3,620,000) of the\r\npopulation. This percentage takes into account the city population, of\r\nwhich the majority are Jews and “Russians.” In the districts, as\r\nChihirin, Svenihorodka, Uman, Tarashcha, the percentage of Ukrainians\r\nexceeds 90%, in Radomishl 80%. The chief foreign element are the Jews\r\n(12%), then the Russians (over 6%), and the Poles (2%). In the city of\r\nKiev the Ukrainians comprise more than one-fifth of the population, as\r\nmuch as the Jews and Poles together. An absolute Ukrainian majority\r\nexists in the cities of Vassilkiv, Kaniv, Tarashcha, Zvenihorodka and\r\nChihirin. In Berdichiv, Cherkassi, Uman, Lipovetz, Skvira and Radomishl\r\nthe Jews predominate.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Podolia (42,000 square kilometers, 3,740,000\r\ninhabitants) has over 81% of its population Ukrainian (3,030,000). In\r\nsome districts the percentage is much higher, as for example in the\r\nDistrict of Mohiliv, 89%. The Jews are the largest foreign element\r\n(12%) then the Russians (3%), and the Poles (2%), who live principally\r\nin the cities. Only the smaller Podolian cities, e.g., Olhopol, Yampol,\r\nStara Ushitza, Khmelnik, have a Ukrainian majority. In Haisin,\r\nVinnitza, Litin and Bar the number of Ukrainians equals the number of\r\nJews; in Kamenetz, Balta, Bratzlav, Letichiv, Mohiliv and Proskuriv the\r\nJews predominate.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Kherson (71,000 square kilometers, 3,500,000\r\ninhabitants), just as the three last discussed, is part of the compact\r\nUkrainian national territory, altho the population of this region\r\nappears much more mixed. The Ukrainians (1,640,000) here comprise\r\nbarely 54% of the population. The chief cause of this is the fact that\r\nin the large cities of this Government, Jews and Russians predominate,\r\nand then there are a great many Roumanian, German and Bulgarian\r\ncolonies. Despite this, however, the Ukrainians constitute an absolute\r\nmajority in most of the districts (e.g., the District of Alexandria 88%\r\nof Ukrainians, Yelisavet 73%, Kherson 70%, Ananiiv 63%), a relative\r\nmajority in the rest (Odessa 47%, Tiraspol 38%). The Russians comprise\r\nmore than 21% of the population, the Jews 12%, the Roumanians over 5%\r\n(District of Tiraspol 27%), the Germans nearly 5%, the Bulgarians and\r\nPoles 1% each. Odessa is a city of many languages. Russians and Jews\r\npredominate; the Ukrainians comprise barely one-eleventh of the\r\npopulation, besides which there are Germans, Roumanians, Bulgarians,\r\nPoles, Greeks, French, English, Albanians, etc. In Mikolaiv the\r\nUkrainians are only one-thirteenth of the population, in Kherson\r\none-fifth, in Yelisavet one-fourth. In the following cities the\r\nUkrainians possess an absolute majority over the Russians: Alexandria,\r\nAnaniiv, Bobrinetz, Vosnesensk, Olviopol, Ochakiv, Berislav, Dubosari.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Bessarabia (46,000 square kilometers, 2,440,000\r\ninhabitants) has only its northwest tip and its coastal region within\r\nUkrainian national territory. The Ukrainians (460,000) comprise barely\r\n20% of the population of this Government, which consists principally of\r\nRoumanians. The territory inhabited by the Ukrainians amounts to 10,000\r\nsquare kilometers. The Ukrainians comprise an absolute majority only in\r\nthe District of Khotin (56%), along with 25% Roumanians and 13% Jews.\r\nIn the District of Akerman the Ukrainians make up 24% of the\r\npopulation, the Bulgarians the same, the Germans and the Roumanians 18%\r\neach, the Turks 4%. The Ukrainians settle on the sea-coast and the\r\nDniester. In the District of Ismail there are 17% Ukrainians, 47%\r\nRoumanians, 11% Bulgarians, 9% Turks, 3% Germans; in the District of\r\nSoroki 17% Ukrainians, 67% Roumanians, 11% Jews. In other districts of\r\nBessarabia there are much fewer Ukrainians; in the district of Biltzi\r\n12%, Benderi 9%, Orhiiv 6%, Kishinev only 2%. In the cities Jews,\r\nRussians and Roumanians predominate. The Ukrainians possess an absolute\r\nmajority only in Akerman, a relative majority in Ismail and Kilia.\r\n\r\nIn our survey of the Ukraine on the left Dnieper bank we shall begin\r\nwith the border regions, coming gradually to the central parts.\r\n\r\nIn the Government of Kursk the Ukrainians (670,000) comprise over 22%\r\nof the population and inhabit the following districts: Putivl (55%\r\nUkrainians), Hraivoron (61%), Novo Oskol (56%), and the southern parts\r\nof Sudga (44%), Rilsk (33%), Korocha (35%), Bilhorod (24%). Besides\r\nthat, the Ukrainians are scattered in large and small language islands\r\nover the Districts of Oboian (12%), Stari Oskol (9%), and Lhov (5%).\r\nThe area of the compact Ukrainian territory in the Government of Kursk\r\nmay be estimated at 12,000 square kilometers. The only neighbors and\r\nco-inhabitants of the Ukrainians here are the Russians, who, even in\r\nmany cities of the purely Ukrainian territory, comprise majorities.\r\nHowever, there are a number of Ukrainian cities in the Kursk country.\r\nMiropilia has 98%, Sudza 65% Ukrainians, Hraivoron and Korocha are half\r\nUkrainian.\r\n\r\nIn the next following border region, the Government of Voroniz (65,000\r\nsquare kilometers, 3,360,000 inhabitants), the Ukrainians inhabit the\r\nDistricts of Ostrohosh (94% Ukrainians), Bohucha (83%), Biriuch (70%),\r\nValuiki (53%), and the southern parts of Pavlovsk (43%), Bobrovsk\r\n(17%), Korotoiak (17%), Novokhopersk (16%). Ukrainian language islands\r\nare found chiefly in the District of Semliansk (4%). The total\r\npercentage of Ukrainians in the Government of Voroniz is 36%, their\r\nnumber over 1,210,000, the surface they inhabit 29,000 square\r\nkilometers. The only neighbors of the Ukrainians here are the Russians,\r\nwho also comprise the majority in all cities. Only in Biriuch,\r\nBohuchar, Ostrohosh, do the Ukrainians predominate.\r\n\r\nIn the Government of the Don Cossack army (164,000 square kilometers,\r\n3,500,000 inhabitants) the relation of the Ukrainians to the population\r\nis similar to that in the Governments of Kursk and Voroniz. Just as the\r\nUkrainian districts there border on the adjacent central Ukrainian\r\nlands of Poltava and Kharkiv, so the Ukrainian parts of the Don country\r\ntouch the central Ukrainian lands of Kharkiv and Katerinoslav. The\r\nUkrainians (980,000) comprise 28% of the population of the Don country\r\nand inhabit 45,000 square kilometers. Most thickly populated by\r\nUkrainians are the southern districts: Tahanroh (69%), Rostiv (52%),\r\nthe western half of the Donetz District (40%). The statistics show far\r\nless Ukrainians in the Districts of Cherkask (23%) and Sal (31%). In\r\nthe Districts of Don I (12%), Don II (4%), Ust Medvedinsk (11%), Khoper\r\n(7%), the Ukrainians form language islands in the midst of a Russian\r\npopulation. In the District of Sal the relative majority is credited to\r\nthe Kalmucks (39%), but beyond that only Russians are the neighbors of\r\nthe Ukrainians. But all this data is not unobjectionable. It has long\r\nbeen an established fact that the lower “Don Cossacks” are for the most\r\npart of Ukrainian nationality. At the same time we see, from the\r\nofficial census of 1897, that none of the Don Cossacks were counted as\r\nmembers of the Ukrainian nation. In the cities of the Don country the\r\nnumber of Ukrainians is very small, e.g., in Rostiv hardly greater than\r\none-fifth. Only the city of Osiv (Azof) is predominantly Ukrainian.\r\n\r\nThe Kuban country (92,000 square kilometers, 2,630,000 inhabitants) has\r\na relative Ukrainian majority (over 47% = 1,250,000), along with 44%\r\nRussians and 9% Caucasus races.\r\n\r\nIn this land the purely Ukrainian country embraces over 56,000 square\r\nkilometers. Three of the districts have an absolute Ukrainian majority:\r\nYask (81%), Temriuk (79%), and Katerinodar (57% Ukrainians, 27%\r\nRussians, 11% Circassians). In the Caucasian District there are 47% of\r\nUkrainians and as many Russians, in the District of Maikop 31%\r\nUkrainians, 58% Russians, 6% Circassians, 2% Kabardines, in the Labinsk\r\nDistrict 28% Ukrainians, 77% Russians, in the District of Batalpashinsk\r\n28% Ukrainians, 39% Russians, 13% Karachaians, 5% Abkhasians, 4%\r\nKabardines, 3% Nogaians, 2% Circassians. It should be observed,\r\nhowever, that perhaps nowhere have so many Ukrainians been entered as\r\nRussians in the census as in these very Caucasian lands. For this\r\nreason the entire Kuban country may be considered Ukrainian territory,\r\nexcept the chains of high mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the Government of Stavropol (60,000 square kilometers, 1,230,000\r\ninhabitants) the Ukrainians comprise 37% (450,000). They inhabit a\r\nregion of nearly 22,000 square kilometers in the west and south of the\r\nGovernment, where the border of the Ukrainian settlements, which\r\nreaches the Caspian Sea, begins. The District of Medveza has 48%\r\nUkrainians (in the west), the District of Stavropol 13% (in the extreme\r\nsouth), the District of Olexandrivsk 40%, Novotvihoriiosk 54% (chiefly\r\nin their southern halves). The neighbors here are Russians and\r\nNogaians.\r\n\r\nIn the Terek region (69,000 square kilometers, 1,183,000 inhabitants)\r\nthe Ukrainians officially comprise only 5% of the population (50,000),\r\naltho it is generally known that an appreciable part of the Terek\r\nCossacks belongs to the Ukrainian nation. A large percentage of\r\nUkrainians (14%) is found only in the District of Piatihorsk; outside\r\nof that the Ukrainians are united in a narrow seam of settlements\r\nextending to the Caspian Sea. 29% of the population in the Terek region\r\nis Russian; the absolute majority is made up by various Caucasian races\r\n(Kabardines, Tatars, Ossetians, Ingushians, Chechenians, Avaro-andians,\r\nKumikians, Nogaians).\r\n\r\nThe small Government of the Black Sea (7000 square kilometers, 130,000\r\ninhabitants) has only 16% Ukrainians who live, 10,000 in number, in the\r\nnorthwestern part of the extended coast region. In the District of\r\nTuapse there are 27% Ukrainians; in the District of Sochi 8%. Their\r\nneighbors are Russians, who do not form an absolute majority at any\r\nplace, then Armenians, Circassians, Greeks, Turks, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most important border country in the south, however, is, without\r\ndoubt, the Government of Tauria (60,000 square kilometers, 1,800,000\r\ninhabitants). The Ukrainians here comprise the relative majority of the\r\npopulation (42%—790,000), with 28% Russians, 13% Crimean Tatars, over\r\n5% Germans, about 5% Jews, about 3% Bulgarians, about 1% Armenians,\r\netc. The Ukrainians comprise an absolute majority in the Districts of\r\nDniprovsk (76%), Berdiansk (64%), and Melitopol (57%), and large\r\nminorities in the Districts of Eupatoria (27%) and Perekop (24%), the\r\nnorthern parts of which they inhabit. The entire mainland part of the\r\nGovernment and the northern part of the Crimean peninsula, consequently\r\nbelong, without doubt, to the compact Ukrainian national territory,\r\nwhile the number of Ukrainians in the southern regions of Crimea\r\nappears much smaller (District of Feodosia 13%, Simferopol 10%, Yalta\r\n2%). The chief foreign element in Tauria is composed of Russians\r\n(Dniprovsk 16%, Melitopol 32%, Berdiansk 18%, Perekop 24%, Eupatoria\r\n17%), and Tatars (Yalta 71%, Simferopol 51%, Feodosia 45%, Eupatoria\r\n40%, Perekop 24%). To the extent that the Tatars emigrate to Turkey,\r\nhowever, the settled area and the number of the Ukrainians of Tauria\r\nconstantly increase, so that the time does not seem far off when the\r\nUkrainian element will have gained the entire Crimean peninsula for its\r\nnational territory. Besides, one must entertain strong doubts\r\nconcerning the actual number of the Russians mentioned in the\r\nstatistics, for the Rittich map of 1878 gives almost no Ukrainians in\r\nTauria, and calls even the mainland parts of Tauria Russian. And twenty\r\nyears later came the just-mentioned figures of the official statistics.\r\nWe may then, confidently consider the entire Government of Tauria a\r\nUkrainian district, with considerable colonization by foreign-speaking\r\npeople. The most important of the foreign settlers are without a doubt\r\nthe Germans. They are 24% of the population in the District of Perekop,\r\n12% in Eupatoria, 8% in Berdiansk, 5% in Melitopol; the Bulgarians make\r\nup 10% of the population in Berdiansk.\r\n\r\nNext to be considered, after these borderlands, are the four central\r\nregions of the Ukraine which lie on the left bank of the Dnieper. In\r\nthe Government of Katerinoslav (63,000 square kilometers, 3,060,000\r\ninhabitants) the Ukrainians 2,110,000 in number, comprise 69% of the\r\ntotal population, with 17% Russians, 5% Jews, 4% Germans, 2% Greeks, 1%\r\neach of Tatars, White Russians and Poles. Detached districts of the\r\nland have very high percentages of Ukrainians, e.g., District of\r\nNovomoskovsk 94%, Verkhnodniprovsk 91%, Olexandrivsk 86%, Pavlohrad\r\n83%. In the large cities the number of the foreign elements is very\r\ngreat, hence, the District of Katerinoslav has 74% Ukrainians, and when\r\nthe city is counted in, only 56% Ukrainians, with 21% Russians, 13%\r\nJews, 6% Germans, 2% Poles. The smallest percentage of Ukrainians is\r\nfound in the southeastern districts of the region, where populous\r\nsettlements of foreign elements exist. The District of Bakhmut, for\r\ninstance, has 58% Ukrainians with 32% Russians, the District of\r\nSlavianoserbsk 55% Ukrainians besides 42% Russians, the District of\r\nMariupol 51% Ukrainians besides 20% Greeks. In the City of Katerinoslav\r\nthe Ukrainians comprise barely one-seventh of the population, while in\r\nOlexandrivsk, Verkhnodniprovsk, Novomoskovsk and Bakhmut, they\r\npredominate over the Russians, and are equal to them in Slaviansk and\r\nPavlohrad.\r\n\r\nIn the Government of Kharkiv (54,000 square kilometers, 3,250,000\r\ninhabitants) the Ukrainians make up 70% of the total population, or\r\n2,275,000. As a result of considerable Russian colonization (28%),\r\nforming several language islands in the midst of Ukrainian territory,\r\nthe percentage of Ukrainians in several districts varies appreciably\r\n(e.g., Smiiv 66%, Vovchansk 75%, Starobilsk 84%, Kupiansk 87%). But we\r\nnote for the first time, here, the remarkable fact that in all the\r\ndistrict cities the Ukrainians are much more numerous than the\r\nRussians. Only in the capital city, Kharkiv, are they in the minority,\r\nand comprise little more than one-fourth the population.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Poltava (50,000 square kilometers, 3,580,000\r\ninhabitants) may be considered the heart of the Ukraine. The Ukrainians\r\nhere comprise 95% of the population, or 3,410,000, beside 4% Jews and\r\n1% Russians. The percentage in detached districts varies between 88%\r\n(District of Konstantinohrad) and 99% (District of Sinkiv). The\r\nRussians and Jews live principally in the cities, where they are always\r\nsecond to the Ukrainians, however, except in the city of Kreminchuk,\r\nwhere the Jews comprise the majority.\r\n\r\nIn the Government of Chernihiv (25,000 square kilometers, 2,980,000\r\ninhabitants) the Ukrainians comprise 86% of the population (2,450,000),\r\nbeside 5% White Russians, 5% Jews, and 4% Russians. With the exception\r\nof the northern districts, Suraz (Ukrainians 19%, White Russians 67%,\r\nRussians 11%), Novosibkiv (Ukrainians 66%, Russians 30%, White Russians\r\n2%), and Starodub (Ukrainians 75%, Russians 22%), all the districts of\r\nthe region have from 88% (Horodnia) to 99% (Krolevetz) of Ukrainians.\r\nAll the district cities, except Novosibkiv, Starodub, Suraz and Mhlin,\r\nhave an absolute Ukrainian majority; the capital, Chernihiv, only a\r\nrelative one.\r\n\r\nThe number of Ukrainians within the compact national territory in\r\nRussia, then, amounts to almost 28½ millions. Excluded in this estimate\r\nare the Ukrainians of the Government of Astrakhan (190,000), Saratov\r\n(220,000), Samara (150,000), Orenburg (50,000), as well as the\r\nUkrainians of all Asiatic-Russian lands, whose number is not placed too\r\nhigh at 500,000. We may therefore estimate the number of Ukrainians in\r\nthe entire Russian Empire as 29½ millions.\r\n\r\nThis figure, which was gained thru a critical survey of the statistical\r\nmaterial of the individual administrative units of Russia, is\r\napproached with remarkable closeness by the figure which may be gotten\r\nin another, more general way. In the year of 1897 the number of\r\nUkrainians in the Russian Empire was 22,400,000; that is, 17.4% of the\r\ntotal population of 129,000,000. Applying the same percentage to the\r\nnumerical estimate of 1910, we get 28,900,000 Ukrainians in a total\r\nRussian population of 166,000,000. Adding the Pinchuks (390,000) who,\r\nin the official statistics were erroneously counted as White Russians,\r\nwe receive for the number of Ukrainians of Russia (1910) 29,300,000.\r\n\r\nNow, adding up all the Ukrainians of the globe, we receive (for 1910)\r\nan amount of 34½ millions; 32,700,000 of it in the compact Ukrainian\r\ncountry. This figure is a minimum value, for in calculating it the\r\nintentional errors of the official statistics were taken into the\r\nbargain. Nevertheless, this figure shows us that the Ukrainians occupy\r\nthe sixth place, numerically, among the nations of Europe, the five\r\nabove them being the Germans, Russians, French, English and Italians.\r\nAmong the Slavic races they stand in the second place.\r\n\r\nHow this great numerical strength of the Ukrainian nation can be\r\nbrought into harmony with its political and economic weakness we shall\r\ntry to show in the sections following. Now let us turn briefly to the\r\ndensity of population of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe 850,000 square kilometers of solid Ukrainian national territory are\r\ninhabited by approximately forty-five million people (1910), of whom,\r\naccording to official estimates, 73% are Ukrainians. The general\r\ndensity of the Ukraine, consequently, amounts to 53 inhabitants to the\r\nsquare kilometer. The Ukraine is also the transition from the thickly\r\npopulated countries of Central Europe to the thinly-peopled northeast\r\nand east of the globe. This transition may easily be followed out\r\nwithin the Ukraine also. The western border regions are the most\r\nthickly settled. Galicia has a density of 102, the Government of Lublin\r\n90, the Government of Kiev 90, Podolia 89, Bukowina 77, Poltava 72. We\r\nsee a wide zone of dense population, then, extending along the 50th\r\nparallel of latitude, from the Carpathians to the Dnieper. To the north\r\nof it, the first more thinly peopled zone extends: Sidletz 69, Grodno\r\n51, Minsk 39, Volhynia 54, Chernihiv 57, Kursk 65, Voroniz 51. On the\r\nsouth of the thickly peopled zone lies the second more sparsely settled\r\nzone: Bessarabia 53, Kherson 49, Tauria 31, Katerinoslav 48. Most\r\nthinly settled, however, are the eastern borderlands of the Ukraine:\r\nKuban 28, Don and Stavropol each 21, Chornomoria and the Terek region\r\neach 17.\r\n\r\nWithin these extensive regions, too, the density of population varies\r\ngreatly. Sometimes districts very close together have a widely\r\ndifferent density. These differences, however, are largely only seeming\r\ndifferences and are caused by the city populations. Thus, for example,\r\nthe marked density of the Districts of Stanislaviv (184), Ternopil\r\n(161), Peremishl (160), Kolomia (156), is caused by the presence of the\r\npopulous cities of the same names. Therefore the Pokutian District of\r\nSniatin (147) seems very thickly settled, because of the smallness of\r\nthe district cities. The average density of Ukrainian East Galicia is\r\nonly 98; in the mountainous Districts of Dolina and Kossiv it only\r\nattains 45. The same conditions exist in Russian Ukraine. The District\r\nof Kharkiv has a density of 164 inhabitants to the square verst; the\r\nDistrict of Kiev 152. Considering only the rural population, however,\r\nthese figures sink to 81 and 75 respectively. Therefore, the District\r\nof Kaniv with its 117 inhabitants to the square verst, (113, or not\r\nreckoning in the inhabitants of the cities), appears to be the\r\nbest-populated district of the Russian Ukraine. Many districts besides,\r\nin Podolia, Kiev, Poltava, Kharkiv and South Volhynia (without counting\r\nthe cities), have a density of 75 and 100, while other districts of the\r\nsame region vary between 50 and 75. In the forest swamp regions of\r\nNorthern Ukraine the density figure falls a great deal. The District of\r\nOvruch, in Northern Volhynia, attains a density of only 29; the\r\nPolissian Districts of Pinsk and Mosir 26 and 17 respectively. The\r\nsteppe country of Southern Ukraine is likewise very thinly settled in\r\nplaces. The density of population of most of the districts of Southern\r\nUkraine varies between 30 and 50, but the Districts of Eupatoria and\r\nPerekop, for example, have only 11 inhabitants per square verst, the\r\nsecond Don District 12, the Sal only 6, the District of Batalpashinsk\r\nin the sub-Caucasian country only 17.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures we see that the Ukraine, as regards its density, is\r\na genuine Eastern European land. But in comparing its density of\r\npopulation with that of the Russian Empire, or even of Russia in\r\nEurope, we perceive that the Ukraine is the most thickly settled part\r\nof the giant Russian Empire, after Poland. Even the most thinly settled\r\nsoutheastern border regions have a greater population to the square\r\nkilometer than Russia’s average (25 per square kilometer). Almost\r\none-fourth of the enormous human reservoirs of Russia are found on\r\nUkrainian territory. And yet the Ukraine, despite its great size, is\r\nonly one-twenty-ninth of the giant Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures we see, furthermore, that trade, industry and\r\ncommerce have, to this day, been unable to influence the density of\r\npopulation of the Ukraine. The Ukraine has remained in the original\r\nstage of development, in which only the age of settlement and the\r\nfertility of the soil form the basis for increase in the density of\r\npopulation. The history of the Ukraine has, to this day, influenced the\r\ncountry’s density of population. The former central districts of the\r\nold Ukrainian state of Kiev and Halich are still the most thickly\r\nsettled; the southern and eastern border regions, which have suffered\r\nmost from the 500 years of the Tartar scourge, the most thinly settled.\r\nThis is the reason that Galicia, one of the poorest regions of the\r\nUkraine in natural resources, where industry and trade are so little\r\ndeveloped, is at the same time the most thickly populated region.\r\n\r\nSimilarly primitive, and betraying a low grade of culture, is the\r\nrelation between the city and country population of the Ukraine. Only a\r\nvery insignificant fraction of the population inhabits the cities and\r\ntowns of the Ukraine. In Galicia (1910) only 14½% of the population\r\nlives in places whose population is more than 5,000; only 9½% in cities\r\nof over 10,000. Similar conditions prevail in Russian Ukraine. Very\r\nrarely does the city population exceed 10% of the total number of\r\npeople, usually keeping below this percentage, which is typical for all\r\nof Russia. Podolia has only 7% city population, Volhynia 8%, Chernihiv\r\n9%, Poltava 10%, Kuban 11%, Katerinoslav 12%, Kiev 13%, and Kharkiv\r\n14%. Only the regions colonized within the last century in Southern\r\nUkraine, with their large cities, have a large percentage of city\r\npopulation (Tauria 20%, Kherson 29%).\r\n\r\nMore glaringly still does the low grade of culture of the Ukraine stand\r\nout when we give the percentage of the Ukrainian population in the\r\ncities of the Ukraine. Only in Galicia do 14% of the Ukrainian people\r\nof the country live in the cities. In the Government of Kharkiv only\r\n10% of the Ukrainians of the district belong to the city population, in\r\nKherson only 9%, in Kuban 8%, in Chernihiv 7%, Poltava 6%, Tauria 5%,\r\nKiev and Katerinoslav each 4%, in Podolia 3%, and in Volhynia actually\r\nonly 2%. It is true that, especially in the cities, the official\r\nestimates were “made” very unfavorably to the Ukrainian element, but,\r\nnevertheless, they show clearly enough that the Ukrainian people,\r\nclinging to their agrarian state, have left the cities, those centers\r\nof cultural and economic life, in the hands of foreign elements. Only\r\nwithin very recent years have these conditions begun to improve. The\r\nforeign-speaking cities are gradually coming to be Ukraine-ized, and\r\nthe very rapidly growing percentage of Ukrainians in Galicia and the\r\nRussian Ukraine justify us in hoping that the Ukrainian element, in its\r\ncontinuous stream from the surrounding country, will, in time, absorb\r\nthe foreign-speaking elements which now command the cities of the\r\nUkraine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UKRAINIAN NATION AS AN ANTHROPOGEOGRAPHIC UNIT\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SURVEY\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter of our little book we mentioned the reasons which\r\ncompel us to regard the Ukraine as a physico-geographic whole. We\r\nemphasized the fact that the geographic units of the great uniform\r\ncountry of Eastern Europe could not, for obvious natural reasons,\r\nappear so well-defined and individualized as the different sections of\r\nWestern and Central Europe. The same is true of the anthropogeographic\r\nconditions of Eastern Europe as well.\r\n\r\nThe anthropogeography of Eastern Europe is so unfamiliar a part of\r\ngeographic science that even such pioneer geographers as Ratzel,\r\nKirchhoff and Hettner entirely misunderstood and misrepresented the\r\nanthropogeographic conditions of Russia, and especially the racial\r\nconditions of this giant empire.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons for the universal ignorance of the\r\nanthropogeographic conditions of Russia which exists even in the ranks\r\nof renowned scholars. The first cause lies in the sources from which\r\nscholars, and subsequently publicists, draw their knowledge of the\r\nsubject. Now the official Russian sources on the basis of which an\r\nanthropogeography of Eastern Europe would have to be written are not\r\nimmune from serious criticism. The ranks of Russian scholars have\r\nalways worked in the interests of the Russian political idea, and\r\nlatterly, caught by the mighty wave of Pan-Slavic-Russian nationalism,\r\nthey are doing their best to represent as actual fact whatever Russian\r\ngovernmental politics would desire to be fact. Russian geography,\r\nethnography, statistics, history, have always worked in accordance with\r\napproved “unifying” designs. Hence, European learning involuntarily\r\nsees all that exists and is coming into existence in Russia thru the\r\nspectacles put on it by official Russia. The same official Russia comes\r\nto meet the European traveler upon every step of his journey, and\r\nguides him in such a way that he may be sure not to see below the\r\ngeneral official Russian varnish what is actual and true. Besides,\r\nthere is the Russian censorship, which even now, after the introduction\r\nof the constitution, takes very good care to veil everything from the\r\nview of the outside world, which, in the interest of the Russian\r\npolitical idea, should remain hidden.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of ignorance as to the anthropogeography of Russia\r\nlies in the subject itself. The Eastern European family of races\r\ninhabiting Russia is so different from that of Western and Central\r\nEurope in its evolution and composition, that the anthropogeographical\r\nlaws and methods which (as far as civilized peoples are concerned) are\r\nbased upon Western European conditions, do not apply in the least in\r\nEastern Europe. A difficulty confronts anthropogeography here,\r\nanalogous to the difficulty which confronted geologic science when,\r\nfitted out with European stratigraphy, it sought to explore South\r\nAfrica or India. The geologists, as representatives of a natural\r\nscience, were readily able to find the way out, but the\r\nanthropogeographers, whose field is more that of a psychic science,\r\nhave lost themselves in false assumptions and in commonplaces.\r\n\r\nWe must not wonder, therefore, if every critical reader of the\r\npreceding chapter is assailed by a host of questions: Why in the world\r\nare the Ukrainians, this second largest Slavic nation of the whole\r\nworld, so utterly unknown? Perhaps Ukraine is only an ethnographic\r\nconception, and the Ukrainians only a branch of the Russian race, just\r\nas the Bavarians or Saxons are branches of the German people? Or are\r\nthe terms “Ukraine,” “Ukrainian”, only outgrowths of the idle\r\nimagination of a few belated enthusiasts, who rave about a glorious\r\npast and a brilliant future, and represent what they are striving after\r\nas a fait accompli, and so forth.\r\n\r\nSuch questions, based upon deep ignorance of the anthropogeography and\r\nhistory of Eastern Europe, come up in this very 20th Century, even in\r\nthe learned circles of scholars, publicists and politicians. To answer\r\nthese and similar questions correctly, this little book has been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainians are quite as independent a Slavic nation as the Czechs,\r\nPoles, White Russians, Russians, Serbs or Bulgarians. The historic\r\nroots of the Ukrainian nation extend just as far back into the early\r\nmiddle ages as the roots of the German, French or English nations. The\r\nold Ukrainian Empire of Kiev is of the same age as the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire of the German Nation. But, while the evolution of the great\r\nEuropean nations was steady and uninterrupted, the Ukrainian Nation was\r\nhindered in its development by reason of its geographical position on\r\nthe threshold of Asia. The Mongolian attack in the 13th Century\r\nshattered the state of Kiev and introduced the 500 years’ Tartar\r\nscourge. Weakened by the continual expeditions and slave-hunts of the\r\nCrimean Tatars, the Ukraine fell under the rule of Lithuania and\r\nPoland, who not only could not relieve the land of the Tatar menace but\r\neven added national, social and religious pressure. The instinct of\r\nself-preservation led the Ukrainian nation, in that troubled time, to\r\ncreate the splendid military organization of the Ukrainian Cossacks,\r\nand about the middle of the 17th Century, in a victorious war, to shake\r\noff the Polish yoke. Thus, the second Ukrainian state, the Cossack\r\nRepublic, came into existence. By the Treaty of Pereyaslav (1654) it\r\nwas ceded as a vassal state to Russia, which was related to it in\r\nreligious faith. But Russia broke the treaties of suzerainty, shared\r\nthe desolated Ukrainian land with Poland, and, after a century and a\r\nhalf, changed the autonomy of the Ukraine into abject serfdom. After\r\nRussia, in the partitions of Poland, had united almost the entire\r\nUkrainian territory under its rule (with the exception of Eastern\r\nGalicia, Northwestern Bukowina, and Northeastern Hungary), it set all\r\nforces to work to destroy the national independence of the Ukrainians\r\nas well. In the 17th and 18th Centuries the Ukrainian Nation lost its\r\nupper classes—the aristocracy, the lesser nobility, the wealthy\r\nburghers—first thru Polonization, then thru Russification. It had left\r\nonly its minor clergy, its lower middle class, and a completely\r\ndowntrodden peasantry. Thus, at the end of the 18th Century, it seemed\r\nas if the last hour of the Ukrainian people had struck.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore easy to explain that in the 19th Century, when the\r\nnational question became one of the most important problems of\r\nhumanity, the two neighbor nations of the Ukraine, the Poles and the\r\nRussians, believed they had solved the “Ukrainian question.”\r\n\r\nThe views of Poles and Russians coincide absolutely in emphasizing one\r\nstatement: “There is no such country as the Ukraine; no such people as\r\nthe Ukrainians; there are only Poland and Russia; a Polish nation and a\r\nRussian nation.”\r\n\r\nThis complete agreement of both nations, whose giant states fought for\r\ntwo centuries for domination in Eastern Europe, may be easily\r\nunderstood. The Ukraine has always been the richest region of Eastern\r\nEurope in natural resources, the Ukrainians the second largest nation,\r\nthe Ukrainian question the most important problem in every state\r\ncommanding Eastern Europe. Now the Ukrainian nation was completely\r\nexhausted by half a thousand years of Tatar oppression and an equally\r\nlong period of serfdom. So that it seemed an easy matter to the mighty\r\nneighbor nations to even deny the existence of the Ukrainian nation, to\r\nhold up its development, and gradually to absorb it.\r\n\r\nThe Poles, since their country lost its independence, have made heroic\r\nattempts to win back their freedom by armed uprisings. Despite all\r\ndefeats, they have never given up their hopes of re-establishing the\r\nPolish Kingdom. But these hopes were never confined to the ethnographic\r\nterritory of the Polish nation. The future Polish Kingdom was to have\r\nthe old boundaries of the historic Poland—the Baltic and the Black Sea.\r\nHence, the geographical conception of Poland, even to the scientific\r\nPolish geographers, still includes, besides the entire Polish\r\nethnographic territory, Lithuania, White Russia and all of the Ukraine,\r\nas far as the Dnieper River and the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nHow could this historico-geographical conception of Poland be made to\r\nharmonize with the ethnographic conception of the Ukraine? The solution\r\nof this question seemed very easy to the Polish scholars and\r\npoliticians. They simply proved that the Ukrainians constituted a part\r\nof the Polish nation, that their language was a provincial dialect of\r\nthe Polish language, and that only the religious faith, a number of\r\nmanners and customs, songs, etc., were slightly different from those of\r\nthe Poles; these slight differences the common country folk might\r\nretain, likewise the educated Ukrainian might be permitted to keep his\r\nlanguage and customs in private life, but in his political sentiments,\r\nin his culture, in his literary language, he must be and remain a Pole.\r\n\r\nThis Polish solution of the Ukrainian question is derived from the\r\nPolish “state-idea” of a Polish Empire extending from the Baltic to the\r\nBlack Sea. Despite the fact that the history of the national relations\r\nof Eastern Europe clearly proved this solution false in the second half\r\nof the 19th Century, the opinion prevails in all important Polish\r\ncircles, that the Ukrainian people merely constitutes an ethnographic\r\nmass which shall make a good foundation for the expansion of Polish\r\nculture and power.\r\n\r\nThis Polish theory in the Ukrainian question has not been detrimental\r\nto the development of the Ukrainian nation. That the Ukrainians are not\r\na Polish people was quite clear to every Ukrainian at the very\r\nbeginning of the relations of the two nations (11th Century). Among the\r\nmasses the feeling of independence was always lively and strong, and\r\nonly those of the educated Ukrainians credited Polonophile theories,\r\nwho were the few members of Polish secret societies, plots, uprisings\r\n(1831, 1863), etc. Polonization, in former centuries, demanded many\r\nvictims from among the educated Ukrainians; in the past half a century\r\nit has only very slight successes to show, altho the Ukrainians of\r\nGalicia still continue to be under the political and cultural influence\r\nof the Poles.\r\n\r\nMuch more dangerous for the Ukrainians was the other solution of the\r\nUkrainian question. It, too, is derived from a state-idea, namely, from\r\nthe idea of a Russian state which should unite all Slavdom, or at\r\nleast, all of the one-time Empire of Vladimir the Great, under its\r\nscepter. In order to attain this end the “Theory of the Unity of the\r\nRussian Nation” was formed, as far back as the times of Peter the\r\nGreat, who transformed the old Muscovite Czar state into an imperial\r\nRussian government, and later this doctrine was further developed.\r\nAccording to this theory the Russian nation consists of three tribes:\r\nthe Great Russians, the Little Russians, and the White Russians, whose\r\ntongues differ from one another only dialectically. A common literary\r\nlanguage, Russian, connects all the tribes; race, customs, history,\r\npolitical aspirations are the same for all three. Ukraine, Ukrainian,\r\nare only local names, which, however, bear a strong taint of\r\nseparatism, and must, therefore, appear dangerous and inadmissible.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of this theory of the unity of the Russian nation, the\r\npolitics of the Russian state have, for more than two centuries, aimed\r\nincessantly to hinder the development of the Ukrainian nation, by means\r\nof the most ruthless oppression, and to degrade it to an ethnographic\r\nmass which, thru its increasing denationalization, should strengthen\r\nthe Russian state and support its political expansion.\r\n\r\nIn a later section we shall be able to follow the individual phases of\r\nRussian state politics in regard to the Ukraine. We shall turn, now, to\r\nconsider the great injury which the Russian unity theory has done to\r\nthe progress of the Ukrainians as a nation.\r\n\r\nThe internal injury of the Russian unity theory to the Ukrainian\r\npeasantry is comparatively slight. The Ukrainian peasant in Russia is\r\nmuch more highly conscious of his national individuality as opposed to\r\nthe Russian than as opposed to the Pole. The ethnologic culture of the\r\nUkrainian peasantry is so much higher than that of the Russian, that\r\nthe Ukrainian looks down with contempt upon the “rough Katzap.” This,\r\nas it were, ethnologic feeling of independence has protected the\r\nUkrainian peasantry from Russification, not only within its national\r\nterritory, but even in its distant Siberian or Turkestan colonies. Only\r\na small part of the so-called village aristocracy, e.g., pensioned\r\nsoldiers, village mayors, notaries, former city workmen who have learnt\r\nsome Russian, try to murder the Russian language and to pass for\r\nRussians. The same is true of a part of the city proletariat. But the\r\ngreat mass is opposed to the Russian language and customs, and\r\npreserves its national individuality unchanged.\r\n\r\nFar more serious injuries has the Russian unity theory caused among the\r\nupper classes of the Ukrainian nation. For the sake of office, honors\r\nand gifts of land, the Ukrainian nobility has, in the last two\r\ncenturies, permitted itself to be Russified for the most part; likewise\r\na host of government officials, military men, clergymen, etc. In the\r\nsecond half of the 19th Century the Russification of the educated\r\nUkrainian circles has slackened its pace, altho, even now, there are in\r\nRussia a great many of the educated Ukrainians by birth who are\r\ncompletely Russified and the worst enemies of their own nation.\r\n\r\nThe Russian unity theory, in the sixties of the 19th Century, found its\r\nway into Austria-Hungary too, and founded the so-called “Russophile\r\nParty.” Its educated retainers, with few exceptions, do not even\r\ncommand the Russian language. Nevertheless, they call themselves\r\nRussians, propagate “the unity of the Russian People from the\r\nCarpathians to the Kamchatka,” and call their Ukrainian mother-tongue\r\n“a dialect of the Carpathian herdsmen and swineherds.” They speak and\r\nwrite a remarkable jargon consisting of Ukrainian, Russian and\r\nChurch-Slavic words (the so-called Yazichiye); only in very recent\r\nyears have they begun to use a bad Russian. Supported by considerable\r\nsubsidies of money from Russia, the educated Russophiles are developing\r\nan active agitation among the peasants of Eastern Galicia, the Bukowina\r\nand Northeastern Hungary. The Russophile peasants of these countries,\r\nwhose number is insignificant, to be sure, constitute a remarkable type\r\nof a seduced mass. They also try to speak the Yazichiye, use the\r\nold-fashioned “thousand-year-old” orthography, which is entirely\r\nanalogous to the Russian and, at least, partly hides the differences\r\nbetween the Ukrainian and Russian languages, live in the illusion that\r\nthe Czar speaks the same language that they speak, use the Russian\r\nnational colors, and hate everything Ukrainian with the passion of the\r\nrenegade.\r\n\r\nThese internal injuries of the Russian unity theory and the Russophile\r\ntide it has created are becoming slighter year by year. Ukrainian\r\nnational consciousness is continually growing in the masses of the\r\nUkrainian nation, and the Russophile wave would long since have\r\ndisappeared if it were not for the Russian subsidies, and if certain\r\nPolish circles, frightened by the rapid advance of the Ukrainian\r\nnational idea, were not working with all their might to prevent the\r\nfall of Russophilism.\r\n\r\nMuch more important are the external injuries done to the Ukrainian\r\nnational idea by the Russian unity theory. They may be expressed in a\r\nsingle sentence: As a result of the absolutism of the Russian unity\r\ntheory in the history, geography and statistics of Eastern Europe, the\r\ncivilized world does not know that there exists in Europe a large\r\ncountry which is called “Ukraina,” and that in this country there lives\r\na nation with a separate individuality, a nation of over thirty million\r\nsouls, which bears the name “Ukrainians.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that, from time to time, since the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, magazine articles and pamphlets in various leading languages\r\nhave appeared, which aim to inform the world about the Ukraine and the\r\nUkrainian people. But these journalistic efforts have only an ephemeral\r\nvalue. Politicians only occasionally interest themselves in the\r\nUkrainian question when it is brought to their notice. And scholars,\r\nhowever well-disposed, can not give such publications preference over\r\nthe official Russian sources.\r\n\r\nThe young Ukrainian learning has thus far been unable to spread true\r\ninformation on the Ukrainian nation, and to establish the Ukrainian\r\nnation in the scientific world as an independent unit among the Slavic\r\nnations. Only in the historical field the independent position of the\r\nUkrainians among the nations of Eastern Europe has been demonstrated,\r\nthanks to the compositions of a Kostomariv, Antonovich, Drahomaniv,\r\nHrushevsky. In the fields of philology, anthropology, ethnology,\r\nethnography and folk-lore, there are many treatises relating to these\r\nsciences, but there is no systematic exposition of the Ukrainian nation\r\nas a uniform whole in relation to these branches of science. In the\r\nanthropogeographic field the present lines constitute the first effort.\r\nIn addition, all these treatises have appeared only in Ukrainian or\r\nRussian, and, consequently, remain inaccessible to the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the European world of scholarship.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons science must depend upon the official statements. The\r\nofficial Russian geography considers the Ukrainians only as one of the\r\nthree tribes of the unified Russian people. The official Russian\r\nstatistics report this to the world. Hence, German, French and English\r\ngeographic science, too, usually accounts for the Ukrainians as\r\nRussians. The names Kleinrussen, Petits Russes, Little Russians, do not\r\nmean an independent nation, but a tribe of the Russian nation. Such\r\nerroneous views may be found in all the general encyclopedias and\r\nlexicons, in all handbooks of geography and statistics. The\r\nAustro-Hungarian Ukrainians, who are mentioned in the official\r\nstatistics as Ruthenians, are also to a great extent taken for a part\r\nof the Russian people which differs from the mass of Russians only in\r\nits Catholic faith, or more remarkably still, for an entirely\r\nindependent little nation called Ruthenia, and differing both from the\r\nLittle Russians and the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe results of such ignorance of the Ukrainian Nation in the scientific\r\nworld are disastrous for the Ukrainians. Every appearance of the\r\nUkrainians in the political and cultural arena remains enigmatic to the\r\nwhole world. Enigmatic remains the struggle of the Ukrainians against\r\nRussia and particularly against its Russification policy. In case after\r\ncase it is explained by far-fetched political, social and economic\r\ncauses, but never by national-cultural reasons. For almost no one in\r\nEurope knows that in the Ukraine a great independent nation is\r\nstruggling for its national life, and not a political or social party\r\nfor its significance in the state. The struggle of the Austrian\r\nUkrainians against the predominance of the Poles in Galicia seems\r\nhardly more reasonable to the foreigner than the striving of the\r\nRussian Ukrainians. Most incomprehensible here appears the struggle of\r\nthe Ukrainians against the Russophile movements. For a long time it was\r\nregarded as insincere, or even as non-existing, and this circumstance\r\nhas brought the Ukrainians innumerable political injuries.\r\n\r\nFrom these briefly stated observations we see what obstacles are\r\nimpeding the Ukrainians in their efforts to bring their Ukrainian\r\nnation to a point where it will be respected as an element of equal\r\nworth with the other nations of Europe. The two neighboring nations,\r\nthe Polish and the Russian, politically and culturally stronger, are\r\ntrying to divide the Ukrainians between themselves, and are refusing\r\nthem the right to exist as an independent nation. Against these\r\nappetites for conquest the comparatively small army of educated\r\nUkrainians is fighting with might and main, supported semi-consciously\r\nby the mass of the Ukrainian People. The Ukrainian peasantry has for\r\ncenturies defied all attacks upon its ethnographic-national\r\nindependence. It refuses, even in its most distant Eastern Siberian\r\ncolonies, to be assimilated by the Russians. This characteristic has\r\nmade the Ukrainians the subject of a proverb with their Russian\r\nneighbors: “Khakhol vsyegda khakhol”—the Ukrainian remains a Ukrainian\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nIn the following sections we shall discuss briefly all the foundations\r\nof the independence of the Ukrainians as a nation. The chief\r\nfoundations of an independent nation are, proceeding from the less\r\nimportant to the most important: Independent anthropological\r\ncharacteristics, a distinct, independent language, uniform\r\nhistorico-political traditions and aspirations for the future, an\r\nindependent culture, and, especially, a compact geographical territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHROPOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UKRAINIANS\r\n\r\nAnthropology is a comparatively recent science. Barely a century has\r\nelapsed since the beginning of its serious work. The material thus far\r\ncollected by anthropological science, while it might seem immense to\r\nsome, is, nevertheless, still small, and what is even more important,\r\nirregular. Concerning some races and peoples the science has many\r\nthousands of measurements at its command, while other races and peoples\r\nare known from very few measurements. For this reason the science of\r\nanthropology is still a long way removed from an exact knowledge and\r\nperfect description of different races and peoples. Even in Europe,\r\nwhere anthropological investigations have been based on a study of the\r\ngreatest number of human individuals, the distribution of various\r\nanthropological racial characteristics in different peoples and tribes\r\nof the continent were, until recently, very hard to interpret and to\r\nunderstand. It is the pioneer work of investigation of Deniker, Hamy\r\nand others, that has made it possible to divide the population of\r\nEurope into so-called anthropological races.\r\n\r\nPure-blooded peoples, all of whose individuals possess the same\r\nanthropological characteristics, exist nowhere. Hardly in the most\r\ninaccessible corners of the globe, are small primitive peoples found\r\nwho approach the ideal of pure-bloodedness. The great civilized peoples\r\nof the earth are all of them more or less heterogeneous peoples, and\r\nshow no uniform anthropological type. This is true especially of the\r\nWestern and Central European cultured peoples: French, English,\r\nSpanish, Italians, even Germans. Continued commixtures, which can\r\ncertainly be proved historically, have entirely eradicated the original\r\nanthropological characteristics of these civilized nations. No wonder,\r\nthen, that anthropogeography, in view of these most apparent examples,\r\nhas almost given up designating anthropological characteristics as the\r\ncharacteristics of nations.\r\n\r\nBut, in considering an Eastern European nation, such misgivings of\r\nanthropogeographical science cannot be justified. Just as the\r\nphysico-geographic conditions of Western and Central Europe are\r\nmeasured by other standards than those of Eastern Europe, so the\r\nanthropogeographical problems of this region, too, must be approached\r\ndifferently. Just as the physico-geographical variety of Western and\r\nCentral Europe gives way to Eastern European uniformity in Ukrainian\r\nterritory, so the anthropological variety gives place to greater unity.\r\nVast areas of the Ukraine, even without any great natural hindrance,\r\nwere always unfavorable to separation into classes, and did not\r\nencourage the development of physical differences. And foreign\r\nadmixtures are almost out of the question. For the foreign peoples\r\nwhich, since the earliest beginnings of history, traversed or even\r\ndominated the region of the Ukraine, were first of all too small in\r\nnumber to make any noticeable impression on the anthropological type of\r\nthe Ukrainians. And, besides that, the foreign races—almost all nomad\r\npeoples—came into the land as fierce enemies, with whom there existed\r\nno voluntary peaceful relations. For these reasons the Ukrainian nation\r\nreveals a much greater uniformity in its anthropological aspect than\r\nthe nations of Western and Central Europe, which, in the course of\r\nhistory, were visited by innumerable peoples of the most varied\r\nanthropological types, who stayed there and were assimilated. If,\r\ntherefore, in these peoples, anthropological characteristics can have\r\nno particular significance, the matter is quite different with the\r\nUkrainians and many other Eastern European nations. Here,\r\nanthropological peculiarities still have considerable weight as\r\ndistinguishing characteristics of nations.\r\n\r\nInvestigations concerning the anthropology of the Ukrainians began more\r\nthan half a century ago. But they were made, without any system, in\r\ndifferent regions of the great national territory selected, quite\r\nwithout a plan, and for a long time gave no acceptable results. Not\r\nuntil the 20th Century was enough material gathered to at least make it\r\npossible to determine the main anthropological type of the Ukrainians.\r\nThe most important investigators in this field are: Hopernitsky,\r\nProtzenko, Welker, Popov, Hilchenko, Krasnov, Petrov, Erckert, Emme,\r\nTalko Hrincewich, Diebold, Biloyid, Anuchin, Ivanovsky, Vovk and\r\nRakovsky.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, according to these investigations, the Ukrainians, too, are\r\nanthropologically a mixed race, just as the other nations of Europe.\r\nBut the formation of this mixed race took place in a very distant\r\nprehistoric past and later admixtures have been too insignificant to\r\nvisibly change the original racial type of the Ukrainians. From the\r\nVislok to the Kuban, from the Pripet to the Black Sea, the Ukrainian\r\npeople constitute a uniform anthropological type. This type has\r\npreserved itself in its purest state in one wide zone which embraces\r\nthe Ukrainian Carpathian Mountain lands, Pokutye, Podolia, Dnieper\r\nPlateau and Dnieper Plain, the Donetz Plateau and the Kuban\r\nsub-Caucasus country. Tall stature, with long legs and broad shoulders,\r\nstrongly pigmented complexion, dark, rich, curly hair, rounded head and\r\nlong face with a high and broad brow, dark eyes, straight nose,\r\nstrongly developed elongated lower part of the face, medium mouth and\r\nsmall ears; that is the type. Outside the described main zone of\r\ndistribution of the Ukrainian racial type, these characteristics become\r\nless and less sharply defined, altho at all parts of the ethnographic\r\nboundary the anthropological differences of the Ukrainians from their\r\nneighbors, especially from the Poles, White Russians and Russians, are\r\nvery clearly marked.\r\n\r\nThe mean stature of the Ukrainians is 1670 mm. Consequently the\r\nUkrainians are among the tallest peoples of Europe, and in this respect\r\nthey surpass their neighboring nations by a great deal. The average\r\nheight of the White Russians is only 1651 mm., the Poles 1654 mm., the\r\nRussian 1657 mm., of 100 individuals among the Ukrainians, 53 are\r\ntaller than the average, 47 shorter; among the Poles and Russians 51%\r\ntaller and 49% shorter. Right here we see a great difference between\r\nthe Ukrainians and their neighbors, as well as a great similarity of\r\nthese three peoples.\r\n\r\nThe tall stature of the pure Ukrainian racial type is pretty regular in\r\nthe above-mentioned main zone. The tallest stature is that of the Kuban\r\nUkrainians of the sub-Caucasus country (1701 mm.). It is due to the\r\nfact that the Ukrainians of that region are, to a great extent,\r\ndescendants of the Zaporog Cossacks, who for centuries represented the\r\nflower of the physical power of the Ukrainian people. Barely below that\r\nis the stature of the Hutzuls (1693 mm.), of the Podolians, Volhynians\r\nand Dnieper dwellers. In Central Galicia, Podlakhia, Polissye, in the\r\nDon country, that is in direct proximity to the Poles, White Russians\r\nand Russians, the stature of the Ukrainians decreases appreciably. But,\r\neven in these border countries, the Ukrainian people form a strong\r\ncontrast, with their higher stature, to their neighbors, especially to\r\nthe Russians, with their heavy mixture of the small grown\r\nFinnish-Mongolian elements. Anuchin emphasizes expressly that in those\r\nparts in any Russian “Government” into which the smallest tip of\r\nUkrainian territory extends, the average height of the recruits is\r\nnoticeably increased. Because of their fine stature many Ukrainians in\r\nRussia are stationed in the regiments of the guard.\r\n\r\nIn the Ukrainians, the tall slender form is coupled with breadth of\r\nshoulders and great chest-measurement. From the material gathered by\r\nIvanosky, it is evident that in this respect the Ukrainians surpass all\r\ntheir neighbors. The average chest-measurement of the Ukrainians is\r\n55.04% of the length of the body, of the Poles 54.11, of the White\r\nRussians 53.84, of the Russians only 52.18.\r\n\r\nIn respect of length of arms and legs, the Ukrainians again occupy an\r\nindependent position among the nations of Eastern Europe. In the White\r\nRussians, the length of the arms is 45.1% of the length of the body, in\r\nthe Poles and Ukrainians 45.7, in the Russians 46.0. The length of the\r\nlegs is greatest in the Ukrainians (53.6%), much less in the Poles\r\n(52.1) and White Russians (51.7), and least in the Russians (50.5),\r\nwhich again indicates considerable mixture of Finnish-Mongolian blood.\r\n(The length of leg of the Mordvines is only 49%, that of the Altaic\r\nTartars 48.6).\r\n\r\nThe most important anthropological characteristic was for a long time\r\nthought to be the shape of the skull. The Ukrainians belong (as do all\r\nSlavs, for that matter) to the class of Brachicephalites (short heads).\r\nThe average skull index in the Ukrainians amounts to 83.2. Among the\r\nneighboring peoples, the Poles (82.1) are least short-headed, then\r\nfollow the Russians, almost the same as the Poles (namely 82.3), and\r\nthen further away the Ukrainians (83.2). The greatest\r\nBrachicephalousness appears in the White Russians (85.1). The height of\r\nthe skull is greatest in the Ukrainians (70.3), smaller in the Russians\r\n(70.1), smallest in the White Russians (66.1).\r\n\r\nThe skull index of the Ukrainians shows a similar territorial\r\ndistribution as the stature. The greatest brachicephalousness is found\r\nin the Hutzuls; it decreases continually as we go northeast and east,\r\nso that in the Don and Kuban region the skull index is smallest.\r\nBesides, the shortness of head of the Ukrainians decreases regularly on\r\nthe Polish and Russian borders, as a result of centuries of proximity.\r\nIn the Russians the shortness of head is much less marked than in the\r\nUkrainians, because of the Finnish strain, in the Poles because of the\r\ncommixture with Finns and a primeval European long-headed and\r\nlight-haired race.\r\n\r\nJust as in the shape of the skull, so also in the form of the nose, the\r\nUkrainians reveal distinct differences from their neighbors. In the\r\nUkrainians the nose is usually straight and thin. The nasal index is\r\n67.7, and consequently somewhat greater than in the Poles (66.2). Then\r\nfollow the Russians (68.5) and the White Russians (69.2).\r\n\r\nThe width of the face in the Ukrainians is on the average 180, that of\r\nthe Poles 181, of the Russians 182, of the White Russians 186; the\r\nfacial index in the Ukrainians 78.1, in the White Russians 76.2, in the\r\nPoles 76.3, in the Russians 76.7. Here, too, we note the great\r\ndifference of the Ukrainians from their neighbors and the similarity of\r\nthese to one another.\r\n\r\nThe color of hair and eyes is by far not so sure an anthropological\r\ncharacteristic as the above-mentioned, yet constitutes an important\r\ncomplement. In this respect, too, the position of the Ukrainians among\r\ntheir neighbor nations is just as independent as in regard to the above\r\ndiscussed characteristics. Among the Ukrainians dark shades\r\npredominate, so that out of 100 individuals only 29.5% have light hair\r\nand eyes, 35% medium color, and 35% dark. In the Russians the\r\npercentages run 37% light, 41% medium, 22% dark; in the Poles 35%\r\nlight, 46% medium and only 19% dark. Thus the light type is much more\r\ncommon in the neighboring races than in the Ukrainians.\r\n\r\nIn the distribution of color of eyes and hair in the Ukrainians the\r\nsame territorial law holds as in the distribution of stature and shape\r\nof skull. In the main zone of the Ukrainian racial type, but especially\r\nin the southwest, the color of hair and eyes is most characteristically\r\nrepresented. Near the Polish, White Russian and Russian borders, the\r\nUkrainian type loses much of its peculiarity.\r\n\r\nThis short anthropological sketch of the Ukrainians, despite its scanty\r\nand general character, enables us to perceive very clearly that the\r\nUkrainians show extremely little anthropological similarity to the\r\nPoles, White Russians and Russians. On the other hand, all of these\r\nneighboring races of the Ukrainians are very similar, and closely\r\nrelated to each other. The Pole, the White Russian and the Russian,\r\nstand very close to one another, while the Ukrainian is very different\r\nfrom all his neighbors and, from an anthropological point of view,\r\nholds an entirely independent position.\r\n\r\nThe vanity of the impression that the Ukrainians are Polonized Russians\r\nor Russified Poles, therefore, becomes apparent at once. The “unity\r\ntheories,” Polish and Russian, which are based on perverted historical\r\nand philological phrases, are here opposed by a natural science, with\r\nits exact results of investigations.\r\n\r\nBut anthropology discredits not only these theories which are still\r\ndominating European science. Several Polish historians have recently\r\nevolved a new theory of the origin of the Ukrainians and spread it thru\r\nEurope. According to this theory the Ukrainians are a mixture of Slavs\r\nand the Mongolian-Turkish nomad tribes which traversed and commanded\r\nthe Ukrainian steppes for centuries; they are a semi-nomadic steppe\r\npeople, incapable of culture, whose development might bring with it the\r\ngreatest dangers for European civilization.\r\n\r\nThe science of anthropology, however, robs this theory of its very\r\nfoundation. The Mongolian-Turkish nomad tribes were almost all\r\ndistinguished by low stature, short legs, long arms and round heads.\r\nThe same characteristics should therefore appear very distinctly in the\r\nUkrainian racial type. But the Ukrainians have a higher stature than\r\nany of the neighboring peoples, the longest legs, and arms of medium\r\nlength. And the brachicephalousness of the Ukrainians is least just in\r\nthe east, where mixing with the Mongolian tribes could proceed most\r\neasily.\r\n\r\nThe anthropological type of the Ukrainians, then, reveals complete\r\nindividuality as opposed to the Polish, White Russian and Russian type,\r\nand betrays no noticeable trace of a Mongolian admixture. The\r\ndifference of the Ukrainian type from the types of other Eastern Slavs\r\ncaught the attention of the great geographer, Reclus, in the eighties\r\nof the past century. At that time he noticed the closer relationship of\r\nthe Ukrainians to the Southern Slavs. Toward the end of the 19th\r\nCentury, Hamy divided all the Slavs into two large groups, a tall\r\nbrachicephalous group with dark hair, and a short, less brachicephalous\r\ngroup with light hair. In the first group he included the Serbians,\r\nCroatians, Slovenes, Czechs and Ukrainians; in the second the\r\nPolabians, Poles, White Russians and Russians. A similar division was\r\naccepted also by Deniker. According to his view the Ukrainians belong\r\nto the so-called Adriatic (Dinaric) Race, while the Poles and the\r\nRussians belong to the two closely related races, the Vistula Race and\r\nthe Oriental Race, respectively. The Adriatic Race has recently come to\r\nbe considered by many the specifically Slavic Race. However, it has\r\nremained comparatively pure only in the case of the Southern Slavs and\r\nthe Ukrainians, while the Northern Slavic races reveal strong foreign\r\nadmixtures.\r\n\r\nAnthropology shows us, in the Ukrainians, a finely grown, physically\r\nsturdy race of men. Another characteristic of the Ukrainian People is\r\nits great fecundity. Wherever the Ukrainian People has not yet\r\ndegenerated thru social pressure and the spread of pauperism, it shows\r\nremarkably high birth figures, which, despite the high infant mortality\r\nresulting from the low grade of culture, occasion a very rapid increase\r\nin population. The birth rate and rate of increase (1900–1904) for the\r\ncentral districts of the Ukraine in European Russia are on the average\r\nyearly: Volhynia 4.5% and 2%, Podolia 4.3% and 1.8%, Kiev 4% and 1.4%,\r\nKherson 4.5% and 2%, Tauria 4.2% and 1.9%, Katerinoslav 5.6% and 2.8%,\r\nChernihiv 4.6% and 2%, Poltava 4.3% and 1.9%, Kharkiv 4.9% and 2%.\r\nGalicia, in the early years of the century, has had a yearly increase\r\nin population of 1.6 to 1.8%. These figures, which are much higher than\r\nthe corresponding figures in Polish or Russian national territory,\r\nconstitute one of the less agreeable facts which enable us to look with\r\nconfidence toward the future of the Ukrainian nation. For the greater\r\nincrease of the Ukrainians is not due to a higher state of culture of\r\nthe neighbor nations. The Polish and Russian peasantry is not only not\r\nsuperior to the Ukrainian in respect to culture, but, on the contrary,\r\ninferior. The greater increase of the Ukrainians is connected only with\r\ntheir superior racial qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UKRAINIAN LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nLanguage is not an absolutely necessary distinguishing characteristic\r\nof a nation, as is shown by the examples of the Swiss, the North\r\nAmericans, and the Spanish and Portuguese daughter-nations in America.\r\nIf the Ukrainians, determining to be considered an independent nation,\r\nhad the remaining characteristics of an independent nation, they would\r\ncertainly be one even if their language were identical with the\r\nRussian, White Russian or Polish.\r\n\r\nBut, in this regard, the Ukrainians are in the favorable position of\r\nreally calling an independent language their own. To be sure, the\r\nopinion has been to a great extent spread thruout Europe that the\r\nUkrainian language is a rural dialect of the Polish language, and\r\nofficial Russia is still encouraging the view that there is only a\r\n“Little Russian dialect” of the Russian language; European science and\r\npublicism opened the doors to both the above-mentioned unity theories,\r\nand the Russian unity theory has become the solely dominating one even\r\nin German science.\r\n\r\nSlavic philology passes a different judgment. With the exception of a\r\nfew Pan-Russian philologists (Florinsky, etc.), who, as a matter of\r\nfact, are not capable philologists at all, the entire philological\r\nprofession is decided on the point that the Ukrainian language is\r\nrelated to the Russian and the Polish only to the extent that the\r\nSerbian and Bulgarian are, for instance, or the Polish and Czechic. The\r\ninvestigations of Miklosich, Malinovsky, Dahl, Maksimovich, Potebnia,\r\nZitetsky, Ohonovsky, Shakhmatov, Broch, Baudouin de Courtenay,\r\nFortunatov, Korsh, Krimsky, Satotsky, and others, have proved beyond a\r\ndoubt that the Ukrainian language is not a dialect of the Russian\r\nlanguage, but an independent language of equal rank with the Russian.\r\nThe same opinion has been expressed most forcibly by the St. Petersburg\r\nAcademy of Sciences in its famous official decision, “Concerning the\r\nRemoval of the Restrictions on Little Russian Publications, St.\r\nPetersburg, 1905.” The Academy emphasized expressly that the Russian\r\nand Ukrainian languages are two independent languages of equal rank.\r\nThe Russian written language is not built up on a general East Slavic,\r\nbut only on a Great Russian foundation. Hence, it cannot be forced upon\r\nthe Ukrainians, since they have a completely developed written language\r\nat their command.\r\n\r\nIt is very likely that, in a far distant prehistoric time, all Eastern\r\nSlavic tribes, the ancestors of the present Ukrainians, White Russians\r\nand Russians, spoke a common tongue. But soon after the beginnings of\r\nhistorical life in Eastern Europe we see these Slavic races divided\r\nlingually into three groups. In the 11th Century, the differences\r\nbetween the language spoken in Kiev or Halich on the one hand, and\r\nVladimir on the Klasma or Sugdal on the other, were already distinct.\r\nThe political unification of all the Eastern Slavic tribes in the Kiev\r\nEmpire could not eradicate these differences between North and South,\r\nand they are very evident in the literary monuments of that time. The\r\ndisruption of the Empire of Kiev into loosely connected principalities,\r\nthe formation of the Muscovite political center, the decline of\r\nKiev—all went to strengthen the lingual antitheses between the\r\nancestors of the Ukrainians and those of the Russians. The Tatar\r\noppression finally separated the Muscovite group permanently from the\r\nUkrainian, forcing each to lead a separate historical life. The Ukraine\r\nfell under Lithuanian, then Polish rule; Muscovy gradually developed\r\ninto the Russian Empire. The differences in language, which in the 14th\r\nCentury were already appreciable, increased so strongly thru the\r\nindependent development of each language that in the 18th Century, when\r\nRussia received the greatest part of the Ukraine beneath her dominion,\r\nthe Russian and Ukrainian languages confronted one another as entirely\r\nindependent languages.\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigations of Stotzky and Gartner, the Ukrainian\r\nlanguage, from a philological point of view, is related to the Russian\r\nonly to about the same extent that it is related to the Polish or\r\nCzechic. Of all Slavic languages the nearest to the Ukrainian is the\r\nSerbo-Croatian. From this it follows that the Ukrainians must at one\r\ntime have had a much closer community with the Serbo-Croations than\r\nwith the Russians.\r\n\r\nWe see here a fine example of how relationship of languages goes hand\r\nin hand with anthropological relationship. (Incidentally, proof is\r\nherewith presented that the anthropological characteristics in the\r\npeoples of Eastern Europe have an entirely different significance from\r\nthe same in Western and Central Europe). This coincidence of two\r\nsciences, entirely independent of one another, causes the Ukrainians to\r\nappear to us a very peculiar independent unit in the Slavic family of\r\nraces. Only the restriction of the knowledge of Ukrainian among\r\nSlavists, the interpretation of Eastern European history always from\r\nthe Russian point of view, the common church language, which, for a\r\nlong time, was the basis of the written language as well, the\r\nunfortunate confusion due to the name Russ, Russki, which as ancient\r\nstate designations for the Empire of Kiev were usurped by the Muscovite\r\nEmpire and applied to all Eastern Slavic nations; these things have\r\nmade it possible to conceal the real state of affairs from the eyes of\r\nEuropean science and have helped establish the Russian unity theory.\r\n\r\nThat the Ukrainian language is independent and entirely different from\r\nRussian or Polish is known to every illiterate peasant from one end of\r\nthe Ukraine to the other. He does not understand the Pole and the\r\nRussian; likewise his language is unintelligible to a Pole or Russian.\r\nPolish is the more easily understood by the uneducated Ukrainian, since\r\nthe living together of the Poles and Ukrainians for centuries in the\r\nPolish-Lithuanian state resulted in important influences in both\r\ndirections, especially in the vocabulary. But Russian, with its strange\r\nvocabulary and phonetic character, different manner of word-building,\r\ndeclension and conjugation, is for a Ukrainian a difficult foreign\r\nlanguage. How much trouble must the Ukrainian peasantry endure at every\r\nstep because the unintelligible Russian language is used exclusively in\r\nadministration, court, school and church! The educated Ukrainian who\r\nhas been trained in Russian schools has had much trouble to learn his\r\nRussian, and he never has so complete a command of it that a Russian\r\ncould not immediately recognize “the Khakhol in him.” For an educated\r\nUkrainian trained outside of Russia, Russian is as hard to learn, if\r\nnot more so, than the Polish, Czechic or Serbian. Such obvious facts\r\nconvince us of the independence of the Ukrainian language, perhaps,\r\nmore forcibly than the arguments of learned philologists.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian language, like every other great European language, is\r\nnot uniform. Because of the great extent of the Ukrainian territory and\r\nthe great population, favorable conditions have always been present for\r\nthe formation of dialects and idioms. The Ukrainian language has four\r\ndialects,—the South Ukrainian, the North Ukrainian, the Galician (Red\r\nRuthenian), and the Carpathian mountain dialect. The South Ukrainian\r\ndialect embraces the south of the region of Kiev, Kursk, Voroniz, the\r\nentire regions of Poltava, Kharkiv, Kherson, Katerinoslav, Tauria, Don\r\nand Kuban. It possesses three idioms;—the northern, which constitutes\r\nthe basis of the present Ukrainian literary language, the central, and\r\nthe southern or steppe idiom. The North Ukrainian dialect includes the\r\nChernihov country, the northern part of the Kiev district, Northern\r\nVolhynia, the Polissye along the Pripet, and the northern part of the\r\nPidlassye. Its idioms are the Chernihov, the North Ukrainian proper,\r\nthe Polissian, and the Black Ruthenian. The Galician or Ruthenian\r\ndialect takes in: Galicia (outside of the mountains), the Kholm region,\r\nSouthern Volhynia and Western Podolia, and possesses two idioms,—the\r\nPodolian-Volhynian and the Galician (Dniester) idiom. The Carpathian\r\nMountain dialect includes the entire Ukrainian Carpathian country and\r\nhas four idioms,—the Hutzulian, the Boikish, the Lemko idiom, and the\r\nSlovak-Ruthenian border-idiom.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian dialects and idioms differ very little from one another,\r\nas indeed is the case with all the dialects and idioms of all the\r\nSlavic languages. A comparison of the Ukrainian dialects and idioms\r\nwith the German, for instance, is entirely impossible. The Kuban\r\nCossack or the Boiko, an Ukrainian inhabitant of Polissye or of\r\nBessarabia, understand one another without the slightest difficulty.\r\nOnly the Lemko idiom and Ruthenian-Slovak border-idiom show greater\r\ndifferences than other Ukrainian idioms. Beyond that, a great\r\nuniformity of language prevails thruout the wide areas of the Ukraine.\r\nA popular tale taken on a phonograph in the Kuban sub-Caucasus country\r\nis heard with the same understanding in a peasants’ reading society in\r\nthe neighborhood of Peremishl, as if it came from a neighboring\r\nvillage, instead of a border country of the Ukraine thousands of\r\nkilometers distant. The same folk-songs, proverbs and fairy tales are\r\nfound in Pidlassye and along the Manich, at Chernihiv and Odessa, on\r\nthe Don and on the Dniester.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian language is distinguished by advantages which insure it a\r\nhigh place among Slavic languages. The great wealth of vowels, the full\r\ntone, the softness and flexibility, the transition of many vowels to\r\nthe i-sound, the absence of the massing of several consonants in one\r\nsyllable, make Ukrainian the most melodious Slavic language. After the\r\nItalian language the Ukrainian is best adapted for singing. Most\r\nimportant, however, is the great richness of the Ukrainian language.\r\nThis richness is all the more remarkable in that it did not come about\r\nthru centuries of development of the language in literature and\r\nscience. The common people have collected and preserved the treasures\r\nof the Ukrainian language. While the vocabulary of an English farmer,\r\naccording to Ratzel, does not include more than three hundred words,\r\nthe Ukrainian peasant uses as many thousands. And, incidentally, the\r\npurity of the language is remarkable. Barely a few borrowed words have\r\nbeen introduced into the language of the people thru the centuries of\r\ncontact with neighboring peoples. They disappear entirely amid the\r\nwealth of pure Ukrainian words. What interests us geographers and\r\nnatural scientists most of all is the wonderful wealth of the\r\ncolloquial language in very striking names for surface forms, natural\r\nphenomena, plants and animals. The construction and codification of the\r\nUkrainian terminology of natural sciences and geography was, therefore,\r\nvery easy. The infant science of the Ukraine possesses a terminology\r\nwhich, for example, far surpasses the Russian.\r\n\r\nThe most important proofs of the independence of the Ukrainian language\r\nare Ukrainian literature and Ukrainian science. The Ukrainian language\r\nhas given proof, thru its development of a thousand years, that it is\r\ncapable of giving expression to the loftiest products of human feeling\r\nand human intellect.\r\n\r\nUkrainian national literature cannot possibly be compared with the\r\nliterature of a Provençal or Low German dialect, which represents the\r\ndaily life of a small group of people. Ukrainian Literature is the\r\nversatile literature of a great nation; a literature which looks back\r\nupon a history of a thousand years and continues to develop in spite of\r\nall obstacles. A strong foundation is furnished it in the remarkably\r\nrich, popular poetry, which has not a counterpart in the entire\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nUkrainian Literature holds a high place among Slavic literatures. Only\r\nRussian and Polish Literature surpass it in the number and greatness of\r\ntheir works.\r\n\r\nThe history of almost a thousand years of Ukrainian Literature begins\r\nat the time of the fullest development of the Kiev Empire, when the\r\nso-called Chronicle of Nestor originated, the Galician-Volhynian\r\nChronicle, the powerful Epic of Igor and other important monuments of\r\nUkrainian Literature (the works of Ilarion, Serapion, Kirilo Turivsky,\r\netc.). Their language is built up upon the Church-Slavonic dialect, but\r\npresents great linguistic departures, as early as the 11th Century,\r\nfrom the literary works simultaneously produced in the Russian\r\nterritory to the north.\r\n\r\nThis promising beginning of the old Ukrainian Literature was almost\r\ncompletely crushed by five centuries of Tatar barbarism. The continuous\r\nstate of war, the loss of their independent political organization, the\r\ncrushing foreign yoke, permitted only a weak vegetating of Ukrainian\r\nLiterature for five centuries. Legal, theological, philosophical and\r\npolemic literary monuments and the beginnings of the drama, written in\r\na Macaronic language made up of a mixture of Ukrainian and\r\nChurch-Slavonic, can at the most be considered proof that the educated\r\nUkrainians of that time had too little leisure and opportunity to\r\ndevote themselves to artistic literature.\r\n\r\nBut these times of decline of the written literature are at once the\r\ntimes of the greatest flourishing of the unwritten literature of the\r\npeople. The old pre-christian religious and secular songs and tales\r\nwere not forgotten, and the active, warlike life of the nation created\r\nan immense mass of epic folk-lore dumy, which was sung by by wandering\r\nminstrels (kobzar, bandurist). Toward the end of the 18th Century, when\r\nthe political and national destruction of the Ukrainian nation seemed\r\ninevitable, the Ukrainian popular literature reached such a high stage\r\nof development that it awoke the educated classes of the nation to new\r\nliterary life.\r\n\r\nThrough the introduction of the pure popular speech into Ukrainian\r\nLiterature (by Kotlarevsky, in 1798), and thru the great influence of\r\nthe popular literature, the foundation was laid for an unanticipated\r\nrise of Ukrainian Literature. In the course of the 19th Century the\r\nhistory of Ukrainian Literature has a number of great poets and prose\r\nwriters to show, who would be a credit even to the greatest literatures\r\nof the world (Shevchenko, Vovchok, Kulish, Fedkovich, Franko, Mirni,\r\nKotsiubinsky, Vinnichenko and others), as well as a considerable number\r\nof lesser poets. Great versatility characterizes the works of Ukrainian\r\nLiterature in the 19th Century, and in the 20th Century its development\r\nin all directions is making giant strides.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the 19th Century was also marked by a very active\r\nstudy of the sciences, leading to the founding of two learned bodies\r\nvery much along the plan of the so-called “Academies” (in Lemberg and\r\nKiev). In every branch of human knowledge the Ukrainians can already\r\npoint to publications, books and dissertations in their own language.\r\n\r\nThe versatility and richness of Ukrainian Literature assure it a\r\nprominent place among Slavonic literatures, thus furnishing proof, if\r\nany is needed, that the Ukrainian language is not a mere dialect, but a\r\ncivilized language in every sense of the word; and the testimony of\r\nUkrainian scholarship strengthens the case beyond a doubt. For surely\r\nnobody could discuss problems of higher mathematics, biology or\r\ngeomorphology in a dialect analogous to the Provençal or Low German.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Ukrainian literary language from the speech of the\r\ncommon people makes clear that it will be an admirable means of\r\neducating the race, in view of its well-known intelligence, into an\r\nenlightened and progressive nation. But the Russian government has been\r\nthoroughly aware of this, and for fear of national separatism, has left\r\nno stone unturned in its efforts to stop the development of Ukrainian\r\nLiterature and, finally, by the famous ukase of the Czar of the year\r\n1876 has forbidden absolutely the publication of any writings in the\r\nUkrainian language. None but a really living and significant literature\r\ncould have survived these thirty years (1876–1905) of repression, and\r\nUkrainian Literature has stood the test!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICO-POLITICAL TRADITIONS AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE UKRAINIANS\r\n\r\nAnthropological and lingual distinguishing characteristics are not\r\nsufficient to make a race into a nation. An individual nation, whether\r\nit be a Staatsnation or a Kulturnation, must have its own historical\r\ntradition, its own sacrifices and heroes, its own historical griefs and\r\njoys. These are the basis of the united aspiration to an ideal of the\r\nfuture, of that constant plebiscite which E. Renan regards as the thing\r\nwhich makes a race into a nation.\r\n\r\nNow it is really the historico-political traditions which are very\r\nstrongly developed in the Ukrainians. The story of his fatherland, full\r\nof the most terrible catastrophes, with the frightful Tatar menace and\r\nthe oppression enduring for centuries, still lives in the consciousness\r\nof even the most uneducated Ukrainian. How few happy moments does the\r\nhistory of the Ukraine present, and yet no people in the world so\r\ndearly loves its past and so piously honors its national heroes as the\r\nUkrainian People. And in this connection I do not mean the educated\r\nUkrainians who know the history of their country, but the illiterate\r\npeasant, who recalls in his songs the naval expeditions to\r\nConstantinople, the old princes of the Kiev dynasty, the hetmans, and\r\nthe great commanders of the Cossack period.\r\n\r\nIt is the historico-political tradition, living even in the lowest\r\nranks of the nation, that gives the Ukrainians their most important\r\nindications of separate national existence. And, had it not been for\r\nthe dense ignorance that prevails in Western Europe regarding the\r\nhistory of the eastern half of the continent, and for the advertising\r\ncarried on to this very day by Russian scholars in behalf of their\r\npropaganda for “Russian” history, which has worked its way into all the\r\nhistory books, this real condition of affairs could never have been\r\nobscured so long. We shall now attempt to determine the main lines of\r\nthe Ukrainian historical tradition, basing our exposition on the works\r\nof Kostomariv, Antonovich, Drahomaniv, Hrushevsky and others.\r\n\r\nThe historical life of the Ukrainian Nation has been of an entirely\r\ndifferent type from that of the Poles or Russians. Hence, the\r\nhistorical traditions and, consequently, the present political\r\naspirations of the three nations, are entirely different.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian historical tradition has its roots in the ancient Kingdom\r\nof Kiev. Altho the historians of Eastern Europe are still undecided as\r\nto whether the so-called Old Russian Kingdom was founded by the\r\nVarangians in the present Northern Russia, or by the Eastern Slavic\r\ntribes of the south in Kiev, I have no doubt that the latter view\r\nshould be approved. Anthropogeography knows no instance of a pirate\r\nband, at most a few thousand strong, which, within a few decades, could\r\nconstitute a kingdom embracing half a continent. The Normans, to be\r\nsure, were able to found governments in Normandy, Naples and Sicily;\r\nthey were even able to conquer the England of their day and to settle\r\nthere, because everywhere they could take advantage of already existing\r\nstate organizations and modify them to suit their purpose. Whenever the\r\nstate organization was just in its beginnings, as for instance, in\r\ntheir own country, the Normans exhibited no particular capacity for\r\nstate-organization.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Kingdom of Kiev, which is called “Old Russian” in all\r\nhistorical works, was a state organized by the southern group of the\r\nEastern Slavic races, particularly the Polan race around Kiev. The\r\ntribal chiefs, who had grown rich thru commercial relations with\r\nByzantium, founded the State of Kiev. This government was already in\r\nexistence in the beginning of the 9th Century. With the aid of\r\nmercenaries from Scandinavia (Varangians) who, since the middle of the\r\n9th Century, had been serving in the armies of the princes of Kiev, the\r\nKingdom during the 10th Century gave remarkable evidences of a very\r\nunusual activity of expansion. The Northern Slavic tribes, the forbears\r\nof the Russians of today, were subjugated, the nomadic tribes of the\r\nsteppes were driven back, commercial and cultural relations were\r\nestablished with the Byzantine Empire. In the year 988 the Great Prince\r\nof Kiev (Vladimir the Great), together with all his peoples accepted\r\nGreek Christianity—with Slavic rites. There ensued, especially under\r\nhis successor, Yaroslav the wise, a great advance in the material and\r\nspiritual civilization of the ancient Ukrainians.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the ancient state of Kiev, as well as its civilization,\r\nwas produced by the ancient Ukrainians, is evident, not only from the\r\nfact that the most ancient literary monuments of Kiev already show\r\nspecifically Ukrainian peculiarities of language. A still more\r\nimportant piece of evidence is the constitution of the Kingdom of Kiev,\r\nwhich originated thru the amalgamation of the newly organized royal\r\npower with the original republican constitution of the Ukrainians.\r\n\r\nThe ancient clan constitution has been of as fundamental importance for\r\nthe historico-political tradition of the Ukraine as the Kingdom of Kiev\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAll the power of government rested originally in the hands of the\r\ngeneral assembly of all freemen, whose decrees were executed by elected\r\nofficials, consisting in part of the war-chieftains (probably the later\r\nprinces). In the ancient Kingdom of Kiev there was constant opposition\r\nbetween the power of the princes, which originated later and rested on\r\nmilitary might, and the power of the clan assembly, sanctioned by long\r\ntradition. The Prince, his retainers, and the Boyar nobility, which\r\ngradually developed out of the body of retainers, were never liked by\r\nthe people. The Kingdom of Kiev grew out of the union of trade, and was\r\na union which at that time was necessary. The governmental system\r\nestablished by the princes of the Kiev dynasty, on foreign models, was\r\ninherently alien to the original social-political system of the\r\nUkrainian People, so that the amalgamation of these two elements was\r\ndifficult, in fact, almost impossible.\r\n\r\nAltho, as time passed, the General Assembly (viche—a name that is\r\napplied to all political assemblies of the Ukrainians to this day)\r\npartly regained their former power, and, altho at the same time various\r\nprovisions of the original constitution sifted into the new\r\ngovernmental organization, monarchy, nevertheless, always remained\r\nsomething extraneous and unpleasant to the people. There is no wonder,\r\ntherefore, that the State of Kiev never attained a power in keeping\r\nwith its great territory and population. The people ostensibly\r\nsupported everything which tended to weaken the power of the\r\ngovernment. Thru the entire existence of the ancient Kingdom of Kiev,\r\nits Great Princes were forced to wrestle with the Boyar nobility and\r\nthe people for absolute power. This limitation of the monarchic power\r\nturned out to be a disaster for the Kingdom of Kiev. By applying the\r\npractice of succession to the throne, in accordance with a principle\r\nknown as that of “seniority,” there resulted the formation of numerous\r\npetty principalities, all rather loosely, perhaps only nominally,\r\nsubject to the authority of the Great Prince of Kiev. The Boyar caste\r\nand the people were very persistent in their labors to aid in the\r\nformation and maintenance of these petty principalities thruout the\r\nsouthern portion of the Kingdom of Kiev.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it is very probable that if the ancient State of Kiev\r\nhad survived a longer time, the Ukrainian People would gradually have\r\nbecome accustomed to a constitution founded on caste and privilege. It\r\nwould also have been possible, as early as the Middle Ages, for the\r\nUkrainian People to attain a constitutional monarchy. But things\r\nhappened differently.\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom, weakened by partitions, was soon confronted by a powerful\r\nenemy in the young Muscovite State which was formed by the northern\r\npetty principalities of the Kingdom. In a series of bloody wars with\r\nthe Muscovite State, Kiev was so permanently weakened that the\r\nheadquarters of Ukrainian political life had to be shifted southward,\r\nin the 13th Century, to Halich on the Dniester.\r\n\r\nThen, the situation of this Kiev country was such as to expose it to\r\ncontinuous invasion on the part of the nomadic warlike tribes which\r\ninfested the steppes of the Ukraine. But the nation managed to hold\r\nthem in check during this weary term of warfare. When, however, the\r\nhosts of the Mongol potentate, Djingis Khan, appeared in the Pontian\r\nsteppes, the resources of Kiev and Halich were no longer equal to the\r\npressure. In the three days’ battle on the Kalka (1224) their army was\r\nannihilated, and in 1240 the city of Kiev was razed to the ground. The\r\nprincipality (later kingdom) of Halich survived it by almost a century,\r\nbut could not withstand the continued aggressions of the Tatars on the\r\none side and of the Poles and Lithuanians on the other; in 1340 it was\r\nincorporated with Poland by right of succession, and thus ended the\r\nfirst national organization of the Ukrainian People. All the Ukraine,\r\nexcepting the forest regions in the northwest, had been completely\r\ndevastated.\r\n\r\nThe Polish-Lithuanian state treated the Ukraine as conquered territory.\r\nBeing now dissenters in the midst of a Catholic state, the Ukrainian\r\nnobles were limited in their prerogatives, and deserted their faith and\r\ntheir nationality, in order to have a share in the golden freedom of\r\nPoland. The burgher class was tyrannized (as was the practice all over\r\nPoland); the peasant became a serf. The splendid task of an\r\necclesiastical union with Rome was solved (Florence, 1439; Brest 1596)\r\nin an unsatisfactory manner and bore little fruit at the time. Every\r\nUkrainian was made to feel the iron hand of the Polish government, and\r\ntheir dissatisfaction expressed itself in numerous rebellions. And yet\r\nthe Polish-Lithuanian State was far too weak to protect the Ukraine\r\nagainst the onslaughts of the Tatars. Every year these hordes of riders\r\nsallied forth from the Crimea, pushing their invasions even as far as\r\nGalicia and Volhynia, devastating the country and depopulating it by\r\nseizures of slaves, conducted according to a systematic plan. The\r\nvictims of this slave trade filled the markets of the Orient for\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that this sorely-tried nation should take steps to\r\ndefend itself. And its efforts were successful in that they led to the\r\nformation of a new independent state, but unsuccessful in that they\r\nexhausted its resources and later had a tragical outcome.\r\n\r\nThe constant state of warfare on the Tatar border forced the Ukrainian\r\npopulation in those parts to adopt a policy of continual\r\n“Preparedness.” These fighting people of the marshes led a precarious\r\nlife, but they had access to the virgin lands of the borders with all\r\ntheir natural treasures, and the exploiting Polish officials did not\r\ndare venture forth into these dangerous districts. These armed farmers,\r\nhunters and fishermen led an independent life and called themselves\r\nCossacks, i.e., “free warriors.”\r\n\r\nIn the 16th Century there arose among these Ukrainian Cossacks a\r\nmilitary state organization, the center of which was a strongly\r\nfortified position below the rapids of the Dnieper (the Zaporog Sich).\r\nThe Zaporog warrior state, compared by some to a religious order of\r\nknights (because of their compulsory celibacy and their wars against\r\nunbelievers), by others to a communistic republic, shows us most\r\nclearly what has always been the goal of the Ukrainian “political\r\nidea.” In the Zaporog organization, absolute equality of all citizens\r\nin all political and social rights prevailed above all else. All\r\nauthority was vested in the General Assembly of all the Zaporogs, and\r\ntheir decisions were enforced by elective officers who were, at the\r\nsame time, officers of the army. The liberty of the individual was very\r\ngreat, but had to yield to the will of the whole. And when, in time of\r\nwar, the General Assembly delegated unlimited dictatorial power to the\r\nhighest official, the Hetman, it gave him a degree of authority with\r\nwhich the power of any one of the absolute rulers of Europe at the time\r\ncould not be compared.\r\n\r\nIn the aristocratic state organization of Poland there was no room for\r\nsuch a lawless democratic state as that of the Zaporogs was in Polish\r\neyes. The entire Ukrainian nation regarded the Zaporog Cossacks as\r\ntheir natural defenders against the terrible Tatar peril, and likewise\r\nas their sole hope as opposed to the oppression practiced by the Poles.\r\nAn ominous discontent prevailed thruout the Ukraine, and after the\r\nPoles had naturally taken severe measures, a number of Cossack revolts\r\noccurred in rapid succession, beginning toward the end of the 16th\r\nCentury and filling the first half of the 17th. In these revolts the\r\nCossacks were supported by the oppressed peasantry. But the Polish\r\nKingdom was rather deficient, always, as far as its standing army was\r\nconcerned, and was obliged to appeal to the Ukrainian Cossack\r\norganization, which it could not possibly destroy, to aid in its wars\r\nagainst the Turks, the Russians and the Swedes.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1648, the Ukrainian Cossacks, aided by the entire people,\r\nfrom the Dnieper to the San, raised the standard of rebellion, and\r\nunder the leadership of Bohdan Khmelnitsky, succeeded in annihilating\r\nthe Polish armies. Thus the Ukrainian Nation fought for and won its\r\nindependence again after three hundred years of a foreign yoke.\r\n\r\nKhmelnitsky, after his victory over the Poles, extended the Cossack\r\norganization beyond the narrow bounds of the Zaporoze, over the entire\r\nhuge area of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by enemies on all sides, the new state needed calm and quiet\r\nto enable it to achieve the necessary internal organization. Much time\r\nwas needed to organize the new order completely in so enormous a\r\ncountry, to bring to a successful conclusion the fight against the\r\nPolish social-political order, which had prevailed here so long and was\r\nso different from the Ukrainian. It required much time to work out new\r\nconstitutional forms, which were inevitable, now that the Zaporog\r\norganization was extended over great areas. Khmelnitsky negotiated with\r\nall the surrounding governments and peoples, with the Poles, the\r\nTransylvanians, the Swedes, the Turks, and finally, in 1654, concluded\r\nthe treaty of Pereyaslav with Russia, with which they were related by\r\nties of religion. This treaty provided that the Ukraine should retain a\r\ncomplete autonomy, as well as their Cossack organization, the latter\r\nunder the suzerainty of the Czar. The Hetman, who was to be elected by\r\nthe votes of the General Assembly, was even to retain the right of\r\nconducting an independent foreign policy.\r\n\r\nBut Russia had no mind to respect the treaty that bound it in dual\r\nalliance with the warlike Ukrainian nation. The democratic form of\r\ngovernment in the Ukraine was an abomination to Russia, just as it was\r\nto aristocratic Poland.\r\n\r\nOnce the Cossack republic was under the control of Moscow, the Russian\r\ngovernment felt that not a stone must be left unturned to destroy this\r\ndangerous national organism. Taking advantage of the untimely death of\r\nKhmelnitsky (1657), and the incompetence of his immediate successors,\r\nRussia began her political machinations in the Ukraine. The Cossack\r\ngenerals were inspired with prejudice against the Hetman, the common\r\nCossacks against their superior officers, and the common people against\r\nall who were wealthy and in authority; huge sums of money were spent,\r\nsuccessfully, and vast tracts of land granted as fiefs; and Russia thus\r\nfished in troubled waters to very good advantage. At every successive\r\nelection of a new Hetman the autonomy of the Ukraine was cut down, and\r\nin the Peace of Andrussovo (1667) with Poland, the country was\r\npartitioned. Of the two sections, one, that nearest to Poland, which\r\nhad been dreadfully devastated and depopulated, was ceded to that\r\ncountry, and this section very soon lost its Ukrainian form of\r\ngovernment and its Cossack organization. The section on the other side,\r\nthe left side, east of the Dnieper, under its dashing Hetman, Mazeppa,\r\nmade an effort, during the Scandinavian War, to throw off the Russian\r\nyoke. Mazeppa made an alliance with Charles XII of Sweden. But the\r\nBattle of Poltava (1709) buried all his hopes. He had to flee to Turkey\r\nwith Charles XII, and the Ukrainian rebellion was put down by Peter the\r\nGreat with the most frightful atrocities, and finally the guaranteed\r\nautonomy of the Ukraine was abolished. To be sure, the title of Hetman\r\nwas again introduced after the death of Peter the Great, but it had\r\nonly a wretched semblance of life. Even this shadow of autonomy was\r\ndestroyed in 1764; in 1775 the last bulwark of the Ukraine, the Zaporog\r\nSich, fell into the hands of the Russians thru treachery, and was\r\ndestroyed by them. The peasants became serfs.\r\n\r\nRussia thus succeeded, in the course of about a century and a half, in\r\ncompletely wiping out the later, second Ukrainian state. The devious\r\npolicy Russia was simultaneously carrying on in Poland, led also to the\r\nlatter’s downfall. In the successive partitions of Poland (1772–1795),\r\nthe entire part of that nation which was inhabited by Ukrainians, with\r\nthe exception of Eastern Galicia and the Bukowina, which fell to\r\nAustria, became the property of Russia.\r\n\r\nBut Russia was not satisfied with political domination alone. Russia\r\nalready understood, in the 17th Century, that the Ukrainians differed\r\nentirely from the Russians in language, customs and views of life. The\r\nRussian government, therefore, inaugurated a policy of rigid repression\r\nof all these points of difference. As early as 1680 it prohibited any\r\nuse of the Ukrainian language in ecclesiastical literature. In 1720,\r\nthe printing of any Ukrainian books at all was forbidden. All Ukrainian\r\nschools were closed. In the middle of the 18th Century there were, in\r\nthe province of Chernihov, 866 schools that had been founded during the\r\nperiod of Ukrainian autonomy; sixty years later not one of these was in\r\nexistence. This, together with the attempt to introduce the Russian\r\nlanguage, which none of them understands, is the cause of the\r\noverwhelming percentage of analphabets among the Ukrainians. The\r\nUkrainian orthodox church, which enjoyed absolute autonomy, with a sort\r\nof loose subordination to the Patriarch of Constantinople, was made\r\nsubject to the Patriarch of Moscow (later to the Holy Synod) and became\r\ncompletely Russified. The Greek-United faith, which had many adherents\r\nin the Western Ukraine, was completely suppressed by the Russian\r\ngovernment, and all who confessed it were obliged, by the most terrible\r\npersecutions, to “return to the orthodox belief.” The Ukrainian people\r\nbecame completely estranged from their former national church, which\r\nnow is a tool wielded for purposes of Russification.\r\n\r\nThe bloody wars for independence which the Ukrainian nation waged\r\nagainst Poland and Russia consequently brought no realization of its\r\npolitical ideals of liberty, equality, and a constitutional, democratic\r\nform of government. Instead came a terrible political, social and\r\nnational oppression, which threatened to bring about the downfall of\r\nthe tortured nation.\r\n\r\nBut the Russification of the Ukraine seemed to be making very little\r\nheadway. To be sure, many educated Ukrainians, for the sake of personal\r\nadvantage or for other considerations, did renounce their nationality,\r\nand some in fact, like Gogol, became great lights of Russian\r\nLiterature. Yet there always remained the feeling of national\r\nindependence, together with a living historical tradition, which\r\ncontinued to groan despite all obstacles. The rise of Ukrainian\r\nLiterature did most to aid this great movement.\r\n\r\nThe idea of working for national independence was revived first in the\r\nRussian Ukraine, and found its logical starting point in the tradition\r\nof the one-time autonomy of the country. As early as the forties of the\r\n19th Century, the national ideology of the modern Ukrainian movement\r\nwas complete in all essential respects. It then made its way very\r\nrapidly to the Austrian Ukraine, and Galicia, particularly, soon became\r\na national Piedmont to the Ukrainian people, who were so ruthlessly\r\noppressed in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe present-day political efforts of the Ukrainian nation are a direct\r\ncontinuation of the former efforts, and a logical result of the\r\nhistorical tradition of the Ukraine. The ideal of these efforts was,\r\nand is, liberty and equality and the participation of all in government\r\nand legislation. Not until the present time has this ideal ceased to be\r\nan anachronism; only the present has opened to the Ukrainian nation a\r\nfield of political activity; only in the present have these forms of\r\npolitical life, which the Ukrainian nation strove for, without success,\r\nso many centuries, become the common possession of the entire civilized\r\nworld. Hence, we may look with confidence toward the future. Now, at\r\nlast, the times have come in which the Ukrainian nation may freely\r\ndevelop its political life; the times in which the political ideals\r\nwhich have been sacred to this nation for centuries, have become the\r\ncommon goal of civilized humanity.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the revival of the Ukrainian state developed gradually from\r\na movement with modest aims to one of larger aims. It was generally\r\nrecognized that the free development of the Ukrainian Nation could take\r\nplace only outside of Russia. Hence, in the 20th Century, an\r\nindependent democratic Ukraine, enclosed in its ethnographic\r\nboundaries, became the highest national ideal. Toward this goal all\r\npolitical parties of the Ukraine are striving today. The path leading\r\nto this goal is the fight for the autonomy of the Ukrainian territory\r\nin the frame of the states dominating it. In Russia, the efforts of the\r\nUkrainians are almost hopeless. On the other hand, the Ukrainians place\r\nmuch hope in Austria, who has afforded her Ukrainians opportunities for\r\npolitical and cultural development.\r\n\r\nThe historico-political traditions of the Ukrainians are entirely\r\ndifferent from those of the nations adjacent to them. The Polish\r\ntradition is a tradition of a one-time great kingdom, which was\r\nprobably built up upon a local constitution similar to that of the\r\noldest Ukrainian State. But fate permitted Poland to live thru the\r\nsorrowful period of partitions and civil wars, while, at the same time,\r\nthe old Kingdom of Kiev was destroyed by the Mongols. Poland\r\nconsolidated into a strong united kingdom, western influences destroyed\r\nthe old local constitution entirely, the common people became serfs,\r\nand the classes of the aristocracy, nobility and bourgeoisie were\r\nformed. Thru wars, and particularly thru its union with Lithuania,\r\nPoland increased considerably in size, for a time including almost the\r\nentire bridge of land between the Baltic and the Black Seas, and, in\r\nthe 15th Century, became the most powerful state of Eastern Europe. At\r\nthat time the Poles became the dominant race over the Lithuanians,\r\nWhite Russians, and Ukrainians. The entire ideology of the dominant\r\ncaste became a characteristic of the Poles. In this very property of a\r\nruling people lies the basis of the aristocratic nature of the\r\nhistorico-political tradition of the Poles. This aristocratic quality\r\nhas a more important foundation in the historical development of Polish\r\nsociety. The middle class in Poland declined very rapidly, and the\r\nnobility and the magnates dominated the entire political, social and\r\nintellectual life of the country, so that Polish society, in the last\r\ncenturies of the existence of the Polish kingdom, was purely\r\naristocratic, and was supported on the backs of the completely\r\nsubmerged peasant and middle classes. Even tho, in the patrician\r\nrepublic, when the power of the kings was extremely limited, mobocracy\r\nor even anarchy very often prevailed, these forms also were\r\naristocratic. This aristocratic tradition is responsible for the fact\r\nthat democratic currents still find little encouragement among the\r\nPoles. Even the social democrats are obsessed with the Great-Polish\r\nstate-idea.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, we perceive that the historico-political traditions\r\nof the Poles are entirely different from those of the Ukrainians. Just\r\nas great is the difference in their present aspirations. The Poles,\r\nwith an endurance that is worthy of admiration, and awakens universal\r\nsympathy, are striving for the reorganization of their independent\r\nstate. But not with ethnographic boundaries like the Ukrainians, but\r\nwith ancient historical boundaries from the Baltic to the Dnieper and\r\nthe Black Sea. To attain this goal, the Poles are trying, above all, to\r\nhinder the adjacent peoples, the Lithuanians, White Russians and\r\nUkrainians, in their national progress, and, whenever possible, to\r\nassimilate them. These efforts are responsible for the very sharp\r\nconflicts of the present day between the one-time rulers and their\r\none-time subjects.\r\n\r\nThe Russian historico-political traditions are quite as different from\r\nand as opposed to those of the Ukrainians as the Polish, but in another\r\ndirection. The Muscovite State was created out of the petty\r\nprincipalities which the ancient Kiev dynasty had founded among the\r\nEastern Slavic races and the Finnish tribes of the north. From the\r\nblending of the Slavs and the Finns came the foundation of the present\r\nRussian or Great Russian (Muscovite) Nation. The name “Russian” was\r\nderived from the name of the dynasty. But the state was in reality\r\nsimply Muscovite, for the Muscovite people gave this state a substance\r\nwhich was entirely different from the substance of the old Kingdom of\r\nKiev. As early as the 12th Century we observe the Muscovite people\r\nstriving for centralization and absolute power for the princes in their\r\nstate. It was to the advantage of the prince to undermine the influence\r\nof the Boyar nobility and the clergy, and to attain absolute or even\r\ndespotic power in the state. Not equal rights and liberty for all\r\ncitizens as with the Ukrainians, or for certain classes as with the\r\nPoles, but the despotic authority of the Great Prince (later Czar), is\r\nthe basis of the historico-political tradition of the Russian people.\r\nThe absolute power of the ruler, that everlasting bugbear of the Poles\r\nand Ukrainians, becomes a sacred object to the Russian nation, and\r\nmakes it possible for them to establish a Russian Empire which devours\r\nPoland and the Ukraine. For a comparison of the three adjacent states,\r\nthe second half of the 16th Century affords the best illustration. At\r\nthe same time that the radical-democratic Cossack republic originated\r\nin the Ukraine, and Poland was a paradise of golden freedom for the\r\naristocrats and the nobility, with a powerless kingship and a\r\nsuppressed people, we witness in Russia the bloody orgies of the\r\ndespotism of Ivan the Terrible.\r\n\r\nThe historico-political tradition of the Russian people places the Czar\r\nonly slightly below God. The entire people, without class distinction,\r\nare slaves (kholopi) of the Czar, his property. The individual counts\r\nfor nothing; everything must be sacrificed to the general good, which\r\nis embodied in the Czar. The reforms of Peter the Great, altho they\r\ngave Russia the external appearance of a civilized state, had no\r\nsignificance for the historico-political tradition of Russia. At most,\r\nthey even strengthened the prestige of the absolute rule of the Czar,\r\nthru arguments repeated after the Western European absolutism. Even the\r\nRussian revolution of 1905 could not weaken this historico-political\r\ntradition. At best the revolution undermined its significance in some\r\nspheres of the Russian intelligenzia (numerically small). And, even in\r\nthese spheres, it meant only the modification of the authority for\r\nwhich the Russian national spirit retains an immutable respect.\r\n\r\nThe present-day aspirations of the Russian Nation are hardly definite\r\nin their outlines. Nevertheless, it can already be clearly seen that\r\nthey will follow the beaten path of the century-old tradition. The\r\ngreatest possible expansion and strengthening of the Empire and the\r\nassimilation of all foreign peoples (including the Ukrainians too),\r\nwill constitute the main substance of these aspirations. The Muscovite\r\nworld has always been extremely intolerant of divergencies in faith,\r\nlanguage and customs. This intolerance has always existed, and always\r\nwill exist, even tho it may sometimes conceal itself behind a very\r\ncleverly adjusted mantle of commonplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUKRAINIAN CULTURE\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of culture as a distinguishing mark of a specific nation,\r\nwe mean, of course, not culture in the widest sense of the word, but\r\nthose well-known cultural peculiarities which characterise every\r\nEuropean nation.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine lies wholly within the confines of the greater European\r\ncultural community. But its distance from the great culture-centers of\r\nWestern and Central Europe has, of course, not been without profound\r\neffect. The Ukraine is at a low stage of culture, and must be measured\r\nby Eastern European standards.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine, which in the 11th Century caused great astonishment among\r\ntravelers from Western Europe, because of its comparatively high\r\nculture, can now be counted only as one of the semi-cultural countries\r\nof Europe. The very low stage of material culture, to which the\r\neconomic conditions of the country bear the best witness, is\r\ncharacteristic of the Ukraine in its entire extent. The intellectual\r\nculture of the people appears frightfully low. The number who know how\r\nto read are 172 out of a thousand in Volhynia, 155 in Podolia, 181 in\r\nKiev, 259 in Kherson, 184 in Chernihiv, 169 in Poltava, 168 in Kharkiv,\r\n215 in Katerinoslav, 279 in Tauria, and 168 in Kuban. These hopeless\r\nfigures, to be sure, are only a result of the exclusive use of the\r\nRussian language, which is unintelligible to the Ukrainians, in all the\r\nschools. Even in the first school-year, it is not permitted to explain\r\nthe most unintelligible words of the foreign language in Ukrainian.\r\nThis frightfully low grade of education of the people permits of no\r\nprogress in the economic life of the country. Even the most\r\nwell-meaning efforts of the government or the Zemstvo, break on the\r\nbrazen wall of illiteracy and ignorance of the Russian language. And\r\nUkrainian books of instruction and information are forbidden as\r\ndangerous to the state. No wonder, then, that the Ukrainian farmer\r\ntills his field, raises his cattle, carries on his home industries,\r\ncures his ills, etc., just as his forefathers used to do. There is a\r\nsmall number of the educated who are still cultivating literature and\r\nart, feebly enough for the size of the nation—but how could one speak\r\nof a distinct, independent culture here?\r\n\r\nAnd yet it exists. For the low stage of culture which every foreign\r\ntourist, who only knows the railroads and cities, immediately notices,\r\napplies only to the culture created in the Ukraine by the ruling\r\nforeign peoples, together with the small mass of Ukrainian\r\nintelligenzia. (The intellectual culture of the Ukrainian educated\r\nclasses will be discussed later). In the same way, every hasty observer\r\nwould consider the Ukrainian peasant as a semi-European, standing on a\r\nvery low level of culture. And yet this illiterate peasant possesses an\r\nindividual popular culture, far exceeding the popular cultures of the\r\nPoles, Russians and White Russians. The settlements, buildings,\r\ncostumes, the nourishment and mode of life of the Ukrainian peasant\r\nstand much higher than those of the Russian, White Russian and Polish\r\npeasant. Hence, the Ukrainian peasant easily and completely assimilates\r\nall peasant settlers in his own land. The rich ethnological life, the\r\nunwritten popular literature and popular music which, perhaps, have no\r\ncounterpart in Europe, the highly developed popular art and standard of\r\nliving, preserve the Ukrainian peasant from denationalization, even in\r\nhis most distant colonies. The power of opposition to Russification is\r\nparticularly great. The Ukrainian peasant never enters into mixed\r\nmarriages with the Russian muzhik, and hardly ever lives in the same\r\nvillage with him. The ethnological culture of the Ukrainian people is,\r\nby all means, original and peculiar; entirely different from the\r\npopular cultures of all the neighboring peoples.\r\n\r\nEven in prehistoric times, Ukrainian territory was the seat of a very\r\nhigh culture, the remains of which, now brought to light, astonish the\r\ninvestigator thru their loftiness and beauty. In ancient times the\r\nearly Greek cultural influences flourished in the Southern Ukraine,\r\nthen the Roman, and in the Middle Ages the Byzantine. Byzantine culture\r\nhad a great influence upon ancient Ukrainian culture, and its traces\r\nmay still be seen in the popular costume and in ornamentation.\r\n\r\nThe most important element in Ukrainian culture, however, is entirely\r\npeculiar, and independent of these influences. The entire view of life\r\nof the common man, to this day, has its roots in the pre-Christian\r\nculture of the ancient Ukraine. The entire creative faculty of the\r\nspirit of the nation has its source there; all the customs and manners\r\nand very many of the songs and sayings. Christianity did not destroy\r\nthe old view of life in the Ukraine, but was adapted to it. This\r\naccommodation was all the easier, because the character of the ancient\r\nfaith and philosophy of life of the Ukrainian people were not so gloomy\r\nand cruel as was the case with many of the other peoples of Europe.\r\n\r\nOutside of the prehistoric, Byzantine and Christian body of culture, we\r\nobserve extremely few foreign influences in the popular culture of the\r\nUkraine. It is highly independent and individualized. The Polish and\r\nMuscovite influences are very insignificant, and appear only here and\r\nthere in the borderlands of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nIt would require the giving of a detailed ethnological description of\r\nthe Ukrainian people if we wished to draw a complete picture of its\r\npeculiar culture. Such a description has no place in geography, and\r\ncertainly none in a book of such general nature as this. Therefore, I\r\nshall discuss but briefly the various phases of the popular culture of\r\nthe Ukraine, so that in this respect, too, the independent position of\r\nthe Ukrainians among the peoples of Eastern Europe may appear in the\r\nproper light.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian villages (with the exception of the mountain villages,\r\nwhich consist of a long irregular line of farms) are always built\r\npicturesquely, in pretty places. The huts of a typical Ukrainian\r\nvillage are always surrounded by orchards, which is hardly ever the\r\ncase among the Russians and White Russians, and very rarely so among\r\nthe Poles. These neighbors of the Ukrainians plant orchards only in the\r\nfew regions where professional fruit-growing has developed. In a\r\nUkrainian village, the green of the orchards is considered absolutely\r\nnecessary. The Russian will not endure trees in the neighborhood of his\r\nhut; they obstruct his view. In the Ukraine an orchard is an\r\nindispensable constituent part of even the poorest peasant homestead.\r\nAnd the separate farms, in which very much of the spirit of the\r\nglorious national past still lives, are hidden in the fresh green of\r\nfruit orchards and apiaries.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian house is built of wood only in the mountains and other\r\nwooded areas. In all other regions it is made of clay and covered with\r\nstraw. The front windows are always built facing the south. In this\r\nway, different sides of the houses face the street, and in general,\r\ntoo, street life does not play so important a part in a Ukrainian\r\nvillage as it does in Polish, White Russian or Russian villages. The\r\nUkrainian houses are always well fenced in, altho not so strongly and\r\nso high as the Russian houses in the forest zone, or as the White\r\nRussian houses. They usually stand (except in Western Podolia) rather\r\nfar apart. Thus, the danger of fire is less than in the Russian\r\nvillages of the Chornozyom region, where the huts lie very close\r\ntogether. As a result, the insurance companies, for instance, charge\r\nsmaller premiums in the Governments of Kursk and Voroniz for insuring\r\nUkrainian village properties than for Russian.\r\n\r\nThe general external appearance of the Ukrainian huts, which are always\r\nwell whitewashed and have flower gardens before the windows, is very\r\npicturesque, and contrasts to advantage with the dwellings of the\r\nneighboring races, especially the miserable and dirty Russian “izbas.”\r\nAll the houses of the Ukrainians, excepting, of course, the poorest\r\nhuts, are divided by a vestibule into two parts. The division into two\r\nwe do not find in the typical huts of the Poles and White Russians. A\r\nfurther characteristic in which the Ukrainian house differs from the\r\nhouses of the neighboring peoples, is its comparative cleanliness.\r\nParticularly does it differ in this respect from the Russian izbas,\r\nwhich are regularly full of various insects and parasites, where sheep\r\nand pigs, and, in winter, even the large cattle, live comfortably\r\ntogether with the human inhabitants. The well-known authority on the\r\nRussian village, Novikov, relates a very characteristic little story in\r\nthis connection. Several Russian families settled in a Ukrainian\r\nvillage. Naturally, cattle were kept in the living room. And when the\r\nUkrainian village elders expressly forbade the keeping of cattle in the\r\nhuts, the Russians moved out, because they could not become accustomed\r\nto the Ukrainian orderliness. It happens very seldom that the Russians\r\nlive together with the Ukrainians in one and the same village. In such\r\na case, the Russian part of the village lies separate, on the other\r\nside of a ravine, a creek, or a rivulet. In the regions of mixed\r\nnationality we see, adjoining one another, purely Ukrainian and purely\r\nRussian villages.\r\n\r\nThe interior arrangement of the houses and the arrangement of the\r\nbarnyard differentiate the Ukrainian very sharply from his neighbor.\r\nStill more decidedly does he show his individuality in his dress. The\r\nmode of dress is quite varied thruout the great area of the Ukraine,\r\nand yet we observe everywhere a distinctness of type and individuality\r\nas opposed to the dress of neighboring peoples. Only the dress of the\r\nPolissye people bears some trace of White Russian influence, on the\r\nwestern border of Polish influence, in Kuban of Caucasian influence\r\n(Russian influence appears nowhere). But all these influences are\r\nslight. Ukrainian dress is always original and esthetic. No one can\r\nwonder, therefore, that the Ukrainian costume is surviving longer than\r\nthe Polish, White Russian and Russian, and is giving way very slowly to\r\nthe costume of the cities.\r\n\r\nThe description of even the main types of Ukrainian costume would take\r\nus too far afield; similarly, we cannot discuss the diet of the people\r\nin detail, altho in this respect, too, the Ukrainian race retains its\r\ndefinite individuality, those cases excepted, of course, in which\r\neconomic strain forces the people to be satisfied with “international”\r\npotatoes and bread.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the intellectual culture of the Ukrainian people. If the\r\nmaterial culture of the Ukrainians, despite its originality and\r\nindependence is not at a strikingly higher level than that of the\r\nneighboring peoples, the intellectual culture of the Ukrainian people\r\ncertainly far outstrips all the others.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian peasant is distinguished, above all, by his earnest and\r\nsedate appearance. Beside the lively Pole and the active Russian, the\r\nUkrainian seems slow, even lazy. This characteristic, which is in part\r\nonly superficial, comes from the general view of life of the\r\nUkrainians. According to the view of the Ukrainian, life is not merely\r\na terrible struggle for existence, opposing man to hard necessity at\r\nevery turn; life, in itself, is the object of contemplation, life\r\naffords possibilities for pleasure and feeling, life is beautiful, and\r\nits esthetic aspect must, at all times and in all places, be highly\r\nrespected. We find a similar view among the peoples of antiquity. In\r\nthe present time, this view is very unpractical for nations with wide\r\nspheres of activity. At all events this characteristic of the Ukrainian\r\npeople is the sign of an old, lofty, individual culture, and here, too,\r\nis the origin of the noted “aristocratic democracy” of the Ukrainians.\r\nOther foundations of the individuality of the Ukrainian are the results\r\nof the gloomy historical past of the nation. It is the origin, first of\r\nall, of the generally melancholy individuality, taciturnity, suspicion,\r\nscepticism, and even a certain indifference to daily life. The ultimate\r\nfoundations of the individualism of the Ukrainian are derived from his\r\nhistorico-political traditions; preference for extreme individualism,\r\nliberty, equality and popular government. Proceeding from these\r\nfundamentals, all the typical characteristics of the Ukrainians may be\r\nlogically explained with ease.\r\n\r\nThe family relations reflect the peculiarity of the Ukrainian people\r\nvery clearly. The comparatively high ancient culture, coupled with\r\nindividualism and a love of liberty, does not permit the development of\r\nabsolute power in the head of the family (as is the case among the\r\nPoles and Russians). Likewise the position of woman is much higher in\r\nthe Ukrainian people than in the Polish or Russian. In innumerable\r\ncases the woman is the real head of the household. Far less often does\r\nthis state of affairs occur among the Poles, and only by exception\r\namong the Russians. A daughter is never married off against her will\r\namong the Ukrainians; she has human rights in the matter. Among the\r\nRussians, this business is in the hands of the father, who takes the\r\nso-called kladka for his daughter, that is, he sells her to whomever he\r\npleases. Grown sons among the Ukrainians, as soon as they are married,\r\nare presented by their fathers with a house and an independent farm.\r\nThe dwelling under one roof of a composite family (a family clan), as\r\nis usual among the Russians, is almost impossible among the Ukrainians,\r\nand is of exceedingly rare occurrence. The father has no absolute power\r\nin this case (as among the Russians) to prevent discord in the family.\r\n\r\nIt is part of the peculiarity of the Ukrainians that they seldom form\r\nfriendships, but these are all the more lasting, altho reserved and\r\nrarely intimate. The Russians make friends among one another very\r\neasily, but they separate very easily, too, and become violent enemies.\r\nThe Poles form close friendships easily and are true friends, too.\r\nEnmity is terrible among the Russians; among the Poles and Ukrainians\r\nit is less bitter, and is, moreover, less lasting. The capacity for\r\nassociation is very considerable in the Ukrainians. All such\r\nassociation is based on complete equality in the division of labor and\r\nprofit. A foreman is elected and his orders are obeyed, but he receives\r\nan equal share of the profits and works together with the rest. Among\r\nthe Russians, the bolshak selects his workmen himself, does not work,\r\nand is simply an overseer. Still he receives the greatest part of the\r\nprofits, Among the Poles the capacity for association is but slightly\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture we may also discuss the relation of the Ukrainians to\r\ntheir communities. The Ukrainian community (hromada) is a voluntary\r\nunion of freemen for the sake of common safety and the general good.\r\nBeyond this purpose the Ukrainian hromada possesses no power, for it\r\nmight limit the individual desires of some one of the hromada members.\r\nFor this reason, for example, common ownership of land which has been\r\nintroduced, following the Russian model, chiefly in the left half of\r\nthe Ukraine, is an abomination in the eyes of the Ukrainian people, and\r\nis ruining them, economically, to a much greater extent than the\r\ndivision of the land in the case of individual ownership. The Russian\r\n“mir” is something entirely different. It is a miniature absolute\r\nstate, altho it appears in the garb of a communistic republic. The mir\r\nis completely a part of the Russian national spirit, and the Russian\r\nmuzhik obeys the will of the mir unquestioningly, altho its will\r\nenslaves his own.\r\n\r\nThe general relation to other people has become a matter of fixed form\r\nto the Ukrainians; a form developed in the course of centuries. The\r\nancient culture and the individualistic cult have produced social forms\r\namong the Ukrainian peasantry which sometimes remind one of ancient\r\ncourt-forms. The proximity and influence of cities and other centers of\r\n“culture” have, to a great extent, spoiled this peasant ceremonial. But\r\nin certain large areas of the Ukraine it may still be observed in its\r\nfull development. Great delicacy, courtesy and attention to others,\r\ncoupled with unselfish hospitality, these are the general substance of\r\nthe social forms of our peasants. These social forms are entirely\r\ndifferent from the rough manners of the Polish or Muscovite peasants,\r\nwhich, in addition, have been spoiled by the demoralizing influence of\r\nthe cities.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the Ukrainian people to religion is also original and\r\nentirely different from that of all the adjacent nations. To the\r\nUkrainian, the essence of his faith, its ethical substance, is the\r\nimportant factor. This he feels deeply and respects in himself and\r\nothers. Dogmas and rites are less significant in the Ukrainian’s\r\nconception of religion. Hence, despite differences in faith, not the\r\nslightest disharmony exists between the great mass of the orthodox\r\nUkrainians of Russia and the Bukowina, and the 4,000,000 Greek-Catholic\r\nUkrainians of Galicia and Hungary. From the ancient culture and\r\nconsideration of the individual comes, also, the great tolerance of the\r\nUkrainians toward other religions, a tolerance which we do not find\r\namong the Poles and Russians. The spirit of the Ukrainians has,\r\nlikewise, been very indifferent toward all sects and roskols. Among the\r\nPoles, sects flourished very luxuriantly in the 16th Century; among the\r\nRussians, there are to this day any number of sects, often very curious\r\nones, and more are constantly arising. Among the Ukrainians, a single\r\nsect has been formed, the so-called stunda (a sort of Baptist creed).\r\nThis sect is not the result of rite formalism, however, but merely an\r\neffect of the Russification of the Ukrainian national church. In order\r\nto be able to pray to God in their mother-tongue, more than a million\r\nof the Ukrainian peasantry is persevering in this faith, which came\r\nover from adjacent German colonies, despite harsh persecution on the\r\npart of the Russian clergy and government.\r\n\r\nThe worth of Ukrainian culture appears, in its most beautiful and its\r\nhighest form, in the unwritten literature of the people. The\r\nphilosophical feeling of the Ukrainian people finds expression in\r\nthousands and thousands of pregnant proverbs and parables, the like of\r\nwhich we do not find even in the most advanced nations of Europe. They\r\nreflect the great soul of the Ukrainian people and its worldly wisdom.\r\nBut the national genius of the Ukrainians has risen to the greatest\r\nheight in their popular poetry. Neither the Russian nor the Polish\r\npopular poetry can bear comparison with the Ukrainian. Beginning with\r\nthe historical epics (dumy) and the extremely ancient and yet living\r\nsongs of worship, as for example, Christmas songs (kolady), New Years’\r\nsongs (shchedrivki), spring songs (vessilni), harvest songs\r\n(obzinkovi), down to the little songs for particular occasions (e.g.\r\nshumki, kozachki, kolomiyki), we find in all the productions of\r\nUkrainian popular epic and lyric poetry, a rich content and a great\r\nperfection of form. In all of it the sympathy for nature,\r\nspiritualization of nature, and a lively comprehension of her moods, is\r\nsuperb; in all of it we find a fantastic but warm dreaminess; in all of\r\nit we find the glorification of the loftiest and purest feelings of the\r\nhuman soul. A glowing love of country reveals itself to us everywhere,\r\nbut particularly in innumerable Cossack songs, a heartrending longing\r\nfor a glorious past, a glorification, altho not without criticism, of\r\ntheir heroes. In their love-songs we find not a trace of sexuality; not\r\nthe physical, but the spiritual beauty of woman is glorified above all.\r\nEven in jesting songs, and further, even in ribald songs, there is a\r\ngreat deal of anacreontic grace. And, at the same time, what beauty of\r\ndiction, what wonderful agreement of content and form! No one would\r\nbelieve that this neglected, and for so many centuries, suppressed and\r\ntormented people could scatter so many pearls of true poetic\r\ninspiration thru its unhappy land.\r\n\r\nThis peculiarity of the poetical creative spirit enables us, just as do\r\nthe other elements of culture, to recognize the vast difference between\r\nthe Ukrainian and the Russian people. The Russian folk songs are\r\nsmaller in number and variety, form and content. Sympathetic\r\nappreciation of nature is scant. The imagination either rises to\r\nsupernatural heights or sinks to mere trifling. Criminal monstrosities\r\nand the spirit of destruction are glorified as objects of national\r\nworship. The conception of love is sensual, the jesting and ribald\r\nsongs disgusting.\r\n\r\nLike their popular poetry, the popular music of the Ukrainians far\r\nsurpasses the popular music of the neighboring peoples, and differs\r\nfrom them very noticeably. Polish popular music is just as poor as\r\nPolish popular poetry, and almost thruout possesses a cheerful major\r\ncharacter. Russian popular music has many minor elements in addition to\r\nthe major elements. But the Russian popular melodies are quite\r\ndifferent from the Ukrainian. They are either boisterously joyous or\r\nhopelessly sad. The differences in the character of the melodies are so\r\ngreat that one need not be a specialist to be able to tell at once\r\nwhether a melody is Ukrainian or Russian.\r\n\r\nPopular art, in our people, is entirely original and much more highly\r\nadvanced than in the neighboring peoples. The remains of the ancient\r\npopular painting are still in existence in the left half of the\r\nUkraine. Wood carving has developed to a highly artistic form among the\r\nHutzuls (there are the well-known peasant-artists Shkriblak,\r\nMehedinyuk, and others). The chief field of Ukrainian popular art,\r\nhowever, is decoration. Two fundamental types are used; a geometric\r\npattern with the crossing of straight and broken lines, and a natural\r\npattern, which is modelled after parts of plants (as leaves, flowers,\r\netc.). In the embroideries, cloths and glass bead-work, we find such an\r\nesthetic play of colors, that even tho each individual color is\r\nglaring, the whole has a very picturesque and harmonious effect. The\r\ndecorative art of the Russians is much lower. It is based on animal\r\nmotifs or entire objects, e.g., whole plants, houses, etc., and evinces\r\nan outspoken preference for glaring colors, which are so combined,\r\nhowever, as to shock the eye. Among the Poles, the art of ornamentation\r\nis very slightly developed. As for colors, they prefer the gaudy, not\r\nmany at a time; usually, blue is combined with bright red.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of completeness, we must still say something about\r\nUkrainian manners and customs. In this aspect, too, the Ukrainian\r\npeasantry is richer than its neighbors. Only the White Russians are not\r\nfar behind them. The entire life of a Ukrainian peasant, in itself full\r\nof need and poverty, is, nevertheless, full of poetic and deeply\r\nsignificant usages and customs, from the cradle to the grave. Birth,\r\nchristening, marriage, death, all are combined with various symbolic\r\nusages, particularly the wedding, so rich in ceremonies and songs, so\r\ndifferent in its entire substance from the Russian or Polish. The\r\nentire year of the Ukrainian constitutes one great cycle of holidays,\r\nwith which a host of ceremonies are connected, most of which have come\r\ndown from pre-Christian times. We find similar ceremonies among the\r\nWhite Russians, some also among the Poles, e.g., Christmas songs, songs\r\nof the seasons, but among the Russians, on the other hand, we find no\r\nparallel to the Ukrainian conditions. Among the Russians, neither the\r\nChristmas songs (kolady) are customary, nor the ceremonies of Christmas\r\neve (bohata kutya), neither the midwinter festival (shchedri vechir),\r\nwith its songs (shchedrivki), nor the spring holidays (yur russalchin\r\nvelikden) and spring songs (vesnianki), nor the feast of the solstice\r\n(kupalo), nor the autumn ceremonies on the feast-days of St. Andrew or\r\nSt. Katherine, etc. The entire essence of the popular metaphysics of\r\nthe Ukrainians is quite foreign to the Russians, and almost entirely so\r\nto the Poles. Only the White Russians form a certain analogy, but,\r\namong them, pure superstition outweighs customs and ceremonies in\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nSufficient facts have been given to make clear to the reader the\r\ncomplete originality and independence of Ukrainian popular culture. We\r\nnow come to a brief survey of the cultural efforts of the educated\r\nUkrainians.\r\n\r\nThe number of educated Ukrainians is comparatively small. Hardly a\r\ncentury has passed since the intelligence of the nation awoke to new\r\nlife, yet, in its hands lies the development of the national culture in\r\nthe widest sense of the word. The disproportion between the magnitude\r\nof the task and the small number of the workers for culture, is at once\r\napparent. And yet the results of the work, in spite of obstacles on\r\nevery side, have grown in volume.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine lies within the sphere of influence of European culture.\r\nThis culture has spread from Central and Western Europe over the\r\nterritory of the Ukraine and its neighboring peoples, the Poles,\r\nRussians, White Russians, Magyars and Roumanians. Each one of these\r\nnations has accepted the material culture of Western Europe to a\r\ngreater or less degree, and adjusted the spiritual culture to its\r\nnational peculiarities. The Ukrainians, for a long time after the loss\r\nof their first state and the decline of their ancient culture, found no\r\nline along which they could develop their national culture\r\nindependently. For centuries they vacillated between the cultures of\r\nPoland and Russia. To this day, now that the conditions are much\r\nbetter, one may still find among the Ukrainians individuals who,\r\nculturally, are Poles or Russians, and only speak and feel as\r\nUkrainians. Such a condition is very sad, and causes the Ukraine untold\r\ninjury—most of all in the field of material culture, which, in both\r\nthese neighboring nations, is very incomplete. Agriculture, mining,\r\ntrade and commerce, are on a much lower plane among the Poles than in\r\nWestern Europe. And what is to be said of the Russians, who are a mere\r\nparody of a cultured nation in almost every field, altho they possess\r\nso great a political organization? No one need be surprised that\r\nmaterial culture is of so low a grade in the Ukraine. On the other\r\nhand, it has become clear to every intelligent Ukrainian, that the\r\ndevelopment of material culture is possible only thru Western European\r\ninfluence, by sending Ukrainian engineers, manufacturing specialists,\r\nmerchants and farmers, to Western and Central Europe to learn their\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn the field of Ukrainian mental culture, the chief influences to be\r\nconsidered are Polish and Russian. In this field, Polish culture is\r\ncomparatively very high. It possesses a very rich literature,\r\nconsiderable science and art, and very definite principles of life. The\r\ninfluence of Polish culture is limited almost exclusively to Galicia at\r\nthe present time. But it was very strong until very recent years, when\r\nit began to decrease. At one time, however, the entire Ukraine,\r\nparticularly the right half, was emphatically under the influence of\r\nPolish culture for centuries (16th to the 18th Century).\r\n\r\nThere is one element in the spiritual culture of the Poles which\r\ncertainly deserves to be, and is, imitated by the Ukrainians. It is the\r\ntone of national patriotism, the love for the nation, its present and\r\nits past, which is everywhere evident. Hence, modern Polish literature\r\nmust be a model for Ukrainian literature in its tendencies and its\r\nsentiments. But, beyond its patriotic tone, Polish culture is not\r\nappropriate for the Ukrainian people. It is aristocratic, by reason of\r\nits descent and its philosophy of the universe. It is far removed from\r\nthe mass of the people it should represent. In spite of all efforts,\r\nthe Polish culture of the educated classes has been unable to establish\r\nan organic connection with the common people of Poland. It has been\r\nbuilt up above the masses and has not grown out of them. To build up\r\nUkrainian culture entirely after the model of Polish culture, would\r\nmean to tear it from its life-giving roots in the soul of the people.\r\nThat it would be deadly to Ukrainian culture, the Ukrainians have\r\nperceived for a long time.\r\n\r\nRussian culture is much more dangerous to the Ukrainian people than\r\nPolish. In its material aspect it is of a very low grade. In the\r\nspiritual field it possesses a very rich literature and a noteworthy\r\nscience and art. The spiritual culture of Russia now dominates all of\r\nthe Russian Ukraine, and has, to a great extent, become prevalent even\r\namong those educated Ukrainians in Russia who possess real national\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThis very circumstance constitutes a great danger for the development\r\nof Ukrainian culture. For, let the Muscovite conquest extend over the\r\nUkrainians, even in the cultural field, and there is an end of all the\r\nindependence of the Ukrainian element, and its beautiful language will\r\nbe, in fact, degraded to a peasant dialect. But a still greater danger\r\nlies in the quality of the Russian cultural influence. The first evil\r\ncharacteristic of Russian culture is the complete lack of national and\r\npatriotic sentiment, which is absolutely necessary for an aspiring\r\nculture like the Ukrainian. Russian culture is infecting the Ukrainians\r\nwith an ominous national indifference. Another unfavorable\r\ncharacteristic of all Russian culture, is the fact that it is\r\nundemocratic thru and thru, and very far removed from the Russian\r\npeople. The Russian people did not create this culture; the educated,\r\nin producing it, took nothing from the people. An intelligent man,\r\nbrought up in the atmosphere of Russian culture, is unspeakably distant\r\nfrom the Russian people, so that it is impossible for him to work at\r\nthe task of enlightening them. The views of the Russian “lovers of the\r\npeople” (narodniki), or of a Tolstoy, concerning the common people and\r\nits soul, simply offend us thru their unexampled ignorance of the\r\npeculiarities and customs of the common people.\r\n\r\nA culture so far removed from the people as the Russian can bring no\r\nbenefit to the Ukrainians. We observe this, best of all, in the\r\ncondition of the muzhik, to whom the educated Russian has never been\r\nable to find an approach, and now the latter looks on indifferently,\r\nwhile the masses sink deeper and deeper down into the abyss of\r\nintellectual and spiritual darkness. To guide the common people along\r\nthe path of organic social-political and economic progress, is a task\r\nwhich an intellect permeated with Russian culture can never perform.\r\nThe last Russian revolution, and the beginning of the era of\r\nconstitutional government for Russia, have furnished the best proof for\r\nthe truth of this assertion.\r\n\r\nThe other chief characteristic of Russian culture is its manifest\r\nsuperficiality. Hidden beneath a thin veneer of Western European\r\namenities lies coarse barbarism. The external manners of the educated\r\nRussian very often strike one by the coarseness, lack of restraint and\r\nbrutal recklessness accompanying them. We see, then, that even the\r\nexternal forms of European culture have only been outwardly assumed by\r\nthe Russians. Still poorer is their condition with respect to the\r\nthings of the spirit. We have observed to what a slight degree the\r\nRussians have been able to assimilate the material culture of Europe.\r\nThe same holds for spiritual culture. Russian literature, particularly\r\nthe latest, has brought ethical elements of the most questionable worth\r\ninto the world’s literature. (Artzibashev and others). Russian science,\r\naltho it can point to some great names and has unlimited means at its\r\ndisposal, stands far behind German, English or French science. In\r\nRussian science, everything is done for the sake of effect, without\r\nthoroness, without method, hence fatal gaps appear. Let us consider,\r\nfor example, our science of geography. Hardly a year passes in which\r\nthe Russian government does not send one or more great scientific\r\nexpeditions to Asia or to the North Pole. Each expedition hands in\r\nvolumes of scientific results, and, at the same time, the surface\r\nconfiguration of the most populous and culturally most advanced regions\r\nof European Russia, for example, is barely known in its main aspects.\r\nThe best geography of Russia was written by the Frenchman Reclus. A\r\nmodern, really scientific geography of Russia does not exist.\r\n\r\nEven more emphatically does the superficiality of Russian culture\r\nappear in social and political questions. These two directions of human\r\nthought have, in most recent times, become very popular in all Russian\r\nsociety. But what an abyss separates a European from a Russian in this\r\nfield! In Europe the theses of the social sciences or of politics are\r\nthe result of life. They are adjusted to life conditions and treated\r\ncritically. In Russia they are lifeless dogmas, about which Russian\r\nscholars of the 20th Century dispute with the same heat and in the same\r\nmanner as their ancestors, a few hundred years ago, disputed as to\r\nwhether the Hallelujah should be sung twice or three times, whether the\r\nconfession of faith should read “born, not created” or “born and not\r\ncreated,” whether one should say, “God have mercy upon us” or “Oh God,\r\nhave mercy upon us,” whether one should use two fingers in crossing\r\noneself or three, and so on. Naturally, at that time religious\r\nquestions were the fashion. Today it is social questions. And what does\r\nit amount to? Rampant doctrinism, the eternal use of banal\r\ncommonplaces, an immature setting up of principles. And the result\r\nis—extreme unwieldiness of Russian society in internal politics and in\r\nparliamentarism, in social and national work, together with a deep\r\nscorn of the depraved West (gnili zapad).\r\n\r\nWith this superficiality of Russian culture, its most evil\r\ncharacteristic is connected; the decline of family life and a certain\r\nmoral perverseness. This phenomenon is commonly met with in all peoples\r\nwho have but recently come in contact with Western European culture.\r\nThe bad qualities of a high civilization are always assumed first, the\r\ngood qualities slowly. In this field the Russians have far outstripped\r\ntheir European models.\r\n\r\nThe above facts suffice to prove that Russian cultural influences are\r\ndangerous for the Ukrainian people. The severe, rigid materialistic\r\ncharacter of the Russian people will, without any doubt, enable it to\r\noutlast the storm and stress period of the present Russian culture, and\r\nguide it to a splendid future. But for the Ukrainian people, with its\r\nsentimental, gentle character, the assuming of Russian culture would be\r\na deadly poison. Even supposing that the Ukrainian people might survive\r\nsuch an experiment, a thing which is not likely, it would forever\r\nremain a miserable appendage of the Russian nation.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, such an experiment is entirely unnecessary. Either we say,\r\n“We are Ukrainians, an independent race and different from the\r\nRussians,” and build up our culture quite independently, or we say, “We\r\nare ‘Little Russians,’ one of the three tribes of Great Russia and of\r\nits high culture,” and, in that case, we may calmly lie down on the\r\nworld renowned Ukrainian stove. For then it does not pay even to work\r\nat the development of our language. A third alternative does not exist.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, the former view is generally predominant among the\r\nintelligenzia of the land, and the fact that many intelligent\r\nUkrainians are permeated with Russian culture is due, not to an ideal\r\nconviction, but only to the powerful influence of the Russian schools\r\nand the Russian cities. How do these educated people stand beneath the\r\nUkrainian peasant who, even on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, does\r\nnot exchange his individual Ukrainian popular culture for the Russian,\r\nand deserves the scornful, but in our eyes very commendable saying of\r\nthe Russians, “Khakhol vyesdie kharkhol!”\r\n\r\nIf, then, we are to remain a really independent nation, there is only\r\none avenue open to Ukrainian culture, and that is to follow the culture\r\nof Western Europe step by step, to seek its models among the Germans,\r\nScandinavians, English and French. And this entire development we must\r\nbase upon the broad foundation of our high popular culture. Let us\r\nconsider with what piety the really cultural nations of Europe preserve\r\nthe little remains of their popular culture. Their few usages or\r\nsuperstitions, their little body of folk-songs! How much richer than\r\nthey are we in all our misery! The Ukrainian people spoke a mighty\r\nfirst word thru Kotlarevsky a century ago; it then found the first\r\ndiamond upon its path, the pure language of the people. Unfortunately,\r\nno Ukrainian has yet arisen who could speak just as mighty a second\r\nword by finding ways and means of lifting the treasures of the home\r\nculture of the land, and enabling the entire nation to work at the task\r\nof using them to advantage. This “apostle of truth and science,” as he\r\nis called by Shevchenko, has not appeared, altho he has had several\r\nancestors, like Drahomaniv. But there are already very many Ukrainians\r\nwho would place their seal upon the declaration: “that the Ukraine\r\npossesses so rich a popular culture, that by developing all its hidden\r\npossibilities and supplementing them by elements drawn from the\r\nuntainted sources of Western European culture, the Ukrainian nation\r\ncould attain a complete culture just as peculiar to itself, and just as\r\nexalted among the great European cultures, as Ukrainian popular culture\r\nis among the popular cultures of other peoples.”\r\n\r\nHence, the way lay clearly indicated for the Ukrainians of the 19th and\r\n20th Century. Ethnological investigations and the scientific study of\r\nfolk-lore have been taken up very eagerly by Ukrainian scholars, so\r\nthat in this particular field, recent Ukrainian science, perhaps, ranks\r\nhighest in all Slavic science. In no other cultured nation of Europe is\r\nthe life of the educated elements so permeated with the influences of\r\nthe nation’s own popular culture. The Ukrainian cultural movement is\r\nhardly a century old, and yet it has results to show which, even today,\r\nguarantee the cultural independence of the Ukrainian nation. Active\r\nrelations with Central and Western European cultures have been\r\nestablished, which may become of incalculable effect in the further\r\ndevelopment of Ukrainian culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONS BETWEEN THE SOIL AND THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geographical situation of the Ukraine is the same today as it was a\r\nthousand years ago. If the theories which call the present Ukrainian\r\nterritory the original home of the Aryans are true, the Ukrainians must\r\nbe considered the primeval autochthones. The limits of the Ukrainian\r\nnation, too, are almost the same today as they were a thousand years\r\nago, altho, in the meantime, great shifts have taken place. Only in the\r\nwest, the Ukrainians have lost a strip about 30 kilometers wide to the\r\nPoles, thru the Polonization movement, which has been advancing\r\neastward since 1340. In this section the Ukrainian element has survived\r\nonly in the mountains. The northern border, next to the White Russians,\r\nwhich, since primitive times, has consisted of great forests and\r\nswamps, has always remained without changes of any kind. On the other\r\nhand, the part of the northern border east of the Dnieper, and still\r\nmore the eastern and southern borders, have been subject to radical\r\nchanges in the course of Ukrainian history.\r\n\r\nThe old Ukrainian state of Kiev rapidly developed a far-flung expansive\r\nmovement, and soon covered almost all of Eastern Europe. In the south,\r\nthe old Kingdom of Kiev, and together with it the southern tribes of\r\nEast Slavs (the ancestors of the present Ukrainians) reached the delta\r\nof the Danube and the Black Sea and the foothills of the Caucasus,\r\nwhere, in the present Kuban district, the old province and petty\r\nprincipality of Tmutorokan was situated. How far to the north the\r\nsouthern East Slavic tribes then extended we can not tell exactly. But\r\nit is very improbable that they extended beyond the woods and swamps of\r\nthe Polissye.\r\n\r\nEven at that time, a thousand years ago, the geographical position of\r\nthe Ukraine, on the edge of Europe and the steppe-country of Central\r\nAsia, proved itself dangerous. From the beginning of the Middle Ages\r\non, innumerable tribes of Turkish-Tatar origin, came crowding out of\r\nthe Central Asiatic steppes westward, thru the steppes of Southern\r\nUkraine. The Ukraine had to be the first of all the countries of Europe\r\nto withstand the attack of these hordes. The first Ukrainian conqueror,\r\nSviatoslav, who destroyed the state of the Khazars and Bulgars and\r\ndefeated other weak hordes, was killed in the struggle with the\r\nPechenegs. Volodimir the Great was forced to fight these nomads under\r\nthe very walls of his capital. These wars with nomad tribes, which\r\nbegan before the Ukraine appeared in the arena of history, lasted from\r\nthis time until the end of the 18th Century, with varying fortunes. At\r\ntimes the balance of power was on the side of the Ukraine, and then\r\nUkrainian colonization advanced victoriously to the south and east as\r\nfar as the Black Sea. At other times the nomads were victorious, and\r\nthe eastern and southern boundaries of the Ukraine receded north and\r\nwest. The great chains of fortifications and border walls erected by\r\nthe Great Princes of Kiev, on the southeast borders of the Ukraine,\r\nwere of no avail. At the time of the greatest extent of the Tatar\r\nattacks (15th to 16th Century) almost all the left half of the Ukraine\r\nwas a wilderness, and in the right half Kiev was a border fortress. All\r\nthe southern Dnieper country, the Boh country and Eastern Podolia, was\r\nat that time a sparsely-peopled borderland, and constantly exposed to\r\nthe dangers of Tatar attacks. At that time Ukrainian territory was\r\nconfined to the Polissye, the northern part of Chernihiv, Volhynia,\r\nWestern Podolia, Eastern Galicia and Podlakhia, and only small, very\r\nthinly populated border strips of the adjacent regions. These\r\nfluctuations in the boundaries of the Ukraine have no parallel in the\r\nhistory of Europe, and show most clearly in what difficult straits the\r\nUkrainian nation was forced to live for centuries.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of nomadic Asia for a time greatly weakened the\r\ninfluences of the proximity of another neighbor—the Black Sea. The\r\nBlack Sea was, for the Ukraine, the means of intercourse with\r\nByzantium, the greatest cultural center of Europe in the Middle Ages.\r\nThe Ukraine, because of its waterways, was nearest to Byzantium of all\r\nthe European countries. This comparatively short period in which the\r\nUkraine was able to maintain intercourse with Byzantium, without\r\nobstacles, brought the Ukraine splendid cultural advantages. In a wide\r\nstream the Byzantine material and spiritual culture flowed into the\r\nUkraine, so that the country from the 11th to the 13th Century stood\r\nhighest, culturally, among all the Slavic states and almost equalled\r\nthe Western European states. In some respects the Ukraine of those days\r\nwas even superior to Western Europe. In those days Kiev or Halich\r\nsurpassed London or Paris in wealth and commercial importance.\r\n\r\nThe relations with the sea and with Byzantium kept growing ever more\r\ndifficult for the Ukraine to maintain, however, as a result of the ever\r\ngrowing pressure of the nomad hordes. Finally, in the 13th Century,\r\ncame the Tatar invasions. These have best demonstrated the significance\r\nof the geographical situation of the Ukraine. The ancient Ukrainian\r\nstate had to be the first to withstand the Mongol attack. After the\r\ndefeat, the Ukraine was the first of all the countries of Europe to be\r\ndesolated by fire and sword. It is true that the strong resistance of\r\nthe Ukraine effectively stopped the Tatar pressure, and Europe has this\r\ncircumstance to thank for its escape from the fate of Asia in the 13th\r\nCentury, three-fourths of which was conquered by the Mongols of Djingis\r\nKhan. The Ukrainian state fought a whole century longer with the\r\nTatars, but could not hold their own after that. The Ukraine was\r\nsystematically devastated by the Tatars, and in the struggle with them\r\nthe entire military power of the Ukraine was spent. At the same time\r\nthe neighbors on the north and west—the Poles and Lithuanians—were able\r\nto develop freely behind the protecting back of the Ukraine, and to\r\nincrease their powers. Finally the Poles annexed Eastern Galicia, and\r\nthe rest of the Ukrainians faced the choice of either joining\r\nthemselves to the Lithuanians, whose upper classes were at that time,\r\nculturally, entirely Ukrainian, or to place themselves beneath the\r\nMuscovite yoke. They chose the first. In 1569 the Lublin Union joined\r\nthe Ukraine to Poland. All these things are the unhappy results of the\r\ngeographical situation of the land on the threshold of Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nA long time following the loss of Ukrainian political independence, the\r\nsad results of the geographical situation of the country continued. The\r\nconstant attacks of Tatars and Turks, the millions of Ukrainian slaves\r\nin the slave-markets of the Orient, had to continue for many centuries\r\nto be the source of the oriental world, which was fast hurrying toward\r\nits fall. But soon the geographical situation of the Ukraine began to\r\nwork positively too. The geographical situation, together with other\r\nnatural factors, became one of the main causes for the formation of the\r\nUkrainian Cossack organization. This is not the place to discuss at\r\nlength the significance of the Cossack organization for the Ukraine; we\r\nare only emphasizing the fact that the Cossack organization alone has\r\npreserved the Ukraine from complete downfall.\r\n\r\nThe Cossack organization, as a product of geographical situation, has a\r\nparallel only in the familiar North American backwoodsmen, prairie\r\nhunters and pioneers who constituted the advance guard of European\r\ncivilization on their continent. Yet this analogy is a very weak and\r\nincomplete one. The Zaporog Cossacks can in no way be compared either\r\nwith the Volga, Don or Ural Cossacks, who were chiefly brigands, or\r\nwith the Austro-Hungarian border-soldiers, who were a state\r\norganization. The Ukrainian Cossack organization represented the\r\nefforts for liberty and independence of the entire Ukrainian people,\r\nand, finally, led up to the revival of Ukrainian political life in the\r\nform of an independent hetman state. To be sure, the territory of this\r\nhetman state embraced barely one-half of the Ukraine, but it\r\nconstituted a region about which a Piedmont of independence for the\r\nentire Ukraine might grow up.\r\n\r\nSince the last decades of the 18th Century, the geographical situation\r\nof the Ukraine on the threshold of two continents has been growing from\r\nan unfavorable position to one that may be described as very favorable.\r\n\r\nIt was for the most part with Ukrainian forces that Russia finally\r\ndestroyed the nomads of the Ukrainian steppes. This fact has been of\r\ngreat significance for the Ukraine. Since that time the vast, tho\r\nalmost imperceptible, colonization movement of the Ukrainian people to\r\nthe east, southeast and south, has been in progress. This movement\r\nextended the Ukrainian boundaries twice within a single century. For\r\nthe second time, and in a peaceful way, the Ukraine reached the delta\r\nof the Danube, the Black Sea, the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. All\r\nthis is only an outcome of its geographical situation. In another\r\nsituation the Ukrainians could not so easily dispose of unsettled\r\nlands. This expansion of the Ukrainian people has by no means reached\r\nits maximum, but it has surely passed its climax. To be sure, the\r\nmigration of the Ukrainian element to the east and south is still very\r\nlarge, but there are no longer so many uninhabited districts open to\r\nsettlement as in former times, and the emigration in masses has had to\r\nstop.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the geographical situation opens a very fine prospect for\r\nlater Ukrainian colonial expansion. Ciscaucasia and many regions on the\r\nlower Volga and Ural are, culturally considered, really a bonum\r\nnullius. Russian colonization is directed to other regions, chiefly for\r\nclimatic reasons, and other competing races need hardly be considered\r\nbecause of their smallness. Even at present the Ukrainians constitute a\r\nvery noteworthy minority; in the sub-Caucasian country most probably an\r\nabsolute majority. In the course of a few decades of rather\r\nunsystematic colonization, extensive regions of the sub-Caucasian\r\ncountry, with their wealth of natural resources, will become Ukrainian;\r\nthe entire Kuban region already is part of the compact national\r\nterritory of the Ukrainians, and the Ukrainian language has become an\r\ninternational language for the small mountain races of the Western\r\nCaucasus.\r\n\r\nThe geographical situation of the Ukraine on the threshold of Asia is\r\ndistinctly favorable to the immigration of Ukrainians into Central Asia\r\nand Southern Siberia. In a strip of thousands of kilometers, chains of\r\nUkrainian settlements extend along the southern border of Siberia to\r\nthe Japan Sea. Along this immeasurable strip the number of Ukrainian\r\nsettlements is continually growing. This colonization, which leads tens\r\nof thousands of Ukrainian peasant-settlers to the far east every year,\r\nhas attracted the attention of wider circles only within the last two\r\ndecades. In reality it is much older, for as early as the seventies of\r\nthe past century, German explorers found Ukrainian colonies at the\r\nnorthern base of the Altai and on the Chinese border, etc. The\r\nestablishment of these old and new colonies of the Ukrainians in Asia\r\nis proceeding in all quietude, and is quite analogous to that splendid\r\ncolonization movement of the Ukrainians at the beginning of the 19th\r\nCentury, which, at one time, quite imperceptibly doubled the national\r\nterritory of the Ukrainians.\r\n\r\nYet the colonial expansion of the last century brought the Ukrainian\r\nnation many disadvantages along with the advantages. For more than a\r\ncentury it drained the entire energy of the nation and deprived it of\r\ntens of thousands of the most active and energetic individuals every\r\nyear. All the strength of the nation was turned to the one task of\r\nsettling new lands and cultivating them according to ancient usage.\r\nFrom this cause, the political idea and the cultural efforts of the\r\nUkrainians have suffered very keenly.\r\n\r\nAfter the Ukrainian territory had again reached the Black Sea, as a\r\nresult of colonial expansion, the Black Sea regained its ancient\r\nsignificance to the Ukrainians. Of course, there is no longer any such\r\ncultural center on the Pontus as Byzantium once was, and Turkish\r\ndomination has deprived the formerly highly cultured districts on the\r\nshores of the Black Sea of all their ancient civilization. But the sea\r\nhas retained its capacity for promoting culture, and, after many\r\ncenturies, once more gave the Ukrainians direct connection with the\r\nwide world. To be sure, the Black Sea is closed by nature and by\r\ninternational treaties, and the Russian Government, intentionally or\r\nunintentionally, has never particularly encouraged the development of\r\nPontian navigation; and, to be sure, the Black Sea lies far distant\r\nfrom the main commercial thorofares of the world. But all these\r\ndisadvantages of the Black Sea may lose much of their weight in a short\r\ntime. The materialization of the splendid project to connect the Baltic\r\nand the Black Sea by means of a canal, including the Dvina and the\r\nDnieper, navigable by large vessels, can not be far off. After the\r\ncarrying out of this project the isolation of the Black Sea will be\r\nlessened, and an important channel of sea-navigation will run across\r\nthe entire Ukraine. Pontian navigation must sooner or later experience\r\na great advance, for it is a natural necessity for the productive\r\nhinterland and for the entire Ukrainian shore people, who have always\r\nexhibited considerable skill as seamen. The Ukrainians already\r\nconstitute more than two-thirds of the crews of all Russian trade and\r\nwarships on the Black Sea. With the strengthening of the constitutional\r\nregime in Russia, the obstacles which have been placed in the way of\r\nPontian navigation by the Russian government in favor of Baltic\r\nnavigation must disappear of themselves.\r\n\r\nFinally, the great commercial thorofares of the world are beginning to\r\nmove nearer to Ukrainian territory as the cultural development of the\r\nOrient advances. As the European influences in the Iran, in Syria and\r\nMesopotamia begin to grow, new projects for an overland connection of\r\nEurope with India continually arise. At present the Bagdad Railroad is\r\nthe center of interest, and soon the Persian railroad projects will\r\nclaim attention. But the shortest and easiest overland route from\r\nEurope to India must cross the length of the Ukraine, touching Kiev and\r\nKharkiv, going past the deltas of the Volga and Ural and the Aral Sea,\r\nalong the Amu, and thru Afghanistan and the Punjab. When this route is\r\nonce established the Ukraine will attain a great commercial\r\nsignificance as the right of way of one of the world’s most important\r\ncommercial highways. Then, only, will the importance of the Dnieper and\r\nDon, the Black Sea, the Sea of Azof and the Caspian Sea, as bearers of\r\nthe main commercial road, be indeed realized.\r\n\r\nEveryone can readily understand that in this case the political\r\nsignificance of the Ukraine would also be very great. Even now this\r\nland is an invaluable possession to Russia. Only the possession of the\r\nUkraine makes possible for Russia access to the Black Sea and permits\r\nher to gravitate toward the straits, to win influence on the Balkan\r\npeninsula, to threaten Turkey and the Mediterranean, to dominate the\r\nCaucasus country, to oppress Persia and seek the nearest way to the\r\nIndian Ocean. And when once the overland route to India goes thru\r\nUkrainian territory, the Ukraine will command over a thousand\r\nkilometers of this important road and begin to be a prime factor in\r\nworld politics. The possession of the Ukraine will then be the\r\ncostliest treasure and a life-problem to the state which will dominate\r\nthis territory. Or, if the Ukraine, in all its ethnographic extent,\r\nshould win its political independence, it may in time become one of the\r\nlargest and most powerful states of Europe.\r\n\r\nAnother element of the geographical situation of the Ukraine, which\r\nshould not be underestimated, is the fact that the Ukraine is so remote\r\nfrom all the cultural centers of Europe. We indicated briefly, above,\r\nof what great importance was the short, direct connection of the\r\nUkraine with the Byzantine cultural center. Only during this short\r\nperiod did the historical fate of the Ukraine permit the land to have\r\ndirect relations with an important culture center. The wall of\r\nbarbarian nomad attack separated the Ukraine very quickly from this\r\nculture center, and when it died the Ukraine suddenly fell into a\r\nsituation in which it was far removed from all the cultural centers of\r\nEurope. Only Poland allowed a few elements of Western European culture\r\nto sift thru into the Ukraine. But the lack of Polish political and\r\nsocial organization did not allow Western European culture to take firm\r\nroot in Poland. The Ukraine could, therefore, receive only a little of\r\nthe Western European wealth of culture thru this channel. Until well\r\ninto the 18th Century, Russia stood upon a much lower grade of culture\r\nthan the Ukraine. And altho Russia very soon reached and surpassed her\r\nrival, the Ukraine has, to this day, received nothing worth while from\r\nRussia. The Ukraine even suffered great loss, culturally, from its\r\nunion with Russia. The White Russians, the Roumanians, the Slovaks, the\r\nMagyars, were never so far advanced, culturally, as to be able to teach\r\nthe Ukrainians anything. The centers of Western and Central European\r\nculture—Germany, Scandinavia, France and England—are so far distant\r\nfrom the Ukraine that they can exert only slight and indirect influence\r\nupon its cultural progress. The low state of culture of the Ukraine,\r\nconsequently, springs chiefly from its geographical situation.\r\n\r\nThe second geographical element, surface formation, has had as strong\r\nan influence upon the Ukrainian people as the geographical situation.\r\nThe chief factor in the surface configuration of the Ukraine is the\r\ngreat preponderance of plains and plateaus. These take up nine-tenths\r\nof the area of the Ukraine. The difference in level of the ground is\r\nfrom 200 to 300 meters. Such slight variations in height are of great\r\nsignificance as far as anthropogeographical conditions are concerned.\r\nThe most important characteristic of level countries such as this, is\r\nthe complete lack of such obstacles as might make good natural\r\nboundaries. And the lack of good natural boundaries is very strongly\r\nfelt in the history of all lowland peoples.\r\n\r\nThis lack the Ukrainians have always felt very deeply. With the\r\nexception of the Black Sea, which was once the boundary of the ancient\r\nUkrainian Kingdom of Kiev and now forms the southern boundary of the\r\nUkraine, and, with the exception, also, of the forest swamps of the\r\nPolissye, the Ukraine never possessed, and does not now possess, any\r\ngood natural boundaries. Neither the Carpathians nor the Caucasus have\r\nprovided the Ukraine with a distinct natural boundary line. The borders\r\nand borderlands of the Ukraine lie open, were always easily accessible\r\nto all conquerors, and made the defense of their political independence\r\nmuch harder for the Ukrainians than it has been for any other nation of\r\nEurope. To be sure, the lack of obstacles on the borders made it very\r\neasy for the Ukrainian Kingdom to extend its limits, as the rapid and\r\nappreciable growth of the ancient Kingdom of Kiev best proves. But\r\nlater, unfortunately, this favorable surface formation was taken\r\nadvantage of with much greater gain by the Tatars, Lithuanians, Poles\r\nand Russians, to the ruin of the Ukraine. The facility of military\r\ncampaigns and of territorial conquests, two favorable foundations for\r\nthe development of great land-conquering nations, and at the same time\r\ntypical anthropogeographical characteristics of low countries, have\r\nplayed an active part in the history of the Ukraine. The pressure of\r\nvarious races, which is a characteristic of plain countries, is another\r\ncondition the Ukraine had to face. From the Cimmerians to the Turks,\r\nhow many races have inhabited the steppes of the Ukraine!\r\n\r\nIn the present times of highly developed intercourse, natural obstacles\r\nare losing much of their value, and, for the same reason, the\r\ndisadvantages of low countries are becoming less serious. It is true\r\nthat the Ukraine is hard to defend strategically, and an enemy wishing\r\nto attack Russia in the Ukraine would place her in a very precarious\r\nposition. But the lack of pronounced natural lines of defense is also\r\npeculiar to the eastern border of Germany, for example, or the northern\r\nborder of France. Apart from these strategic elements, the Ukrainian\r\nplain country and plateau country has nothing but advantages. The\r\nmigration of the Ukrainian people has always been very easy, and the\r\ngrowth of Ukrainian territory has been unhindered because of the\r\nopenness of the borders.\r\n\r\nThe lowland character of the Ukraine is important not merely in respect\r\nto borders. The lack of obstacles within the country in the way of\r\nhighlands always favored easy travel in all directions. The building of\r\nthe roads met with no obstacles, and was able to proceed in straight\r\nlines. In the present days of high-roads and railways, this is a very\r\nimportant characteristic of the land. Unfortunately it has never been\r\ntaken advantage of. The railroads of the Ukraine tend toward unknown\r\nRussian centers, without consideration of the natural centers of the\r\ncountry. Hence its insufficient importance for traffic.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of all plain countries, and therefore of the\r\nUkraine, is great homogeneity. It produces a great uniformity of living\r\nconditions, and gives the Ukraine great unity of language, customs and\r\nstandard of living. The types of buildings, national costume, etc., so\r\nvaried in the small area of Germany, extend over hundreds of thousands\r\nof square miles in the Ukraine, with only minor changes. The uniform\r\nlowland character of the Ukraine favored, to a certain degree, the\r\nconstant preservation of the old customs and the gradual development of\r\nculture. The lack of natural differences within the country has brought\r\nwith it the lack of differences among the inhabitants, and it is well\r\nknown that such differences enrich the ability and the character of the\r\nentire nation considerably. Hence, the lack of those necessary\r\nconditions of development and progress has always had a profound\r\ninfluence in the Ukraine, while we meet such favorable conditions at\r\nevery step in the small areas of Central Europe, with their smaller\r\nsupply of natural wealth. Melancholy and indifference, these typical\r\nmarks of the lowland peoples, have always been characteristic of the\r\nUkrainians also. And these types are not favorable to the development\r\nof culture. Only the present time of easy communications are capable of\r\nweakening the bad influence of the uniformity of surface of the Ukraine\r\nto any marked degree.\r\n\r\nYet, not all the typical characteristics of a lowland country are\r\ncommon to the Ukrainians. Above all, they lack, and always have lacked,\r\nthe capacity for the development of great political strength, the\r\ncapacity for centralization; in a word, the capacity for state\r\norganizing. This characteristic of the lowland peoples, which is very\r\nstrongly developed among the Russians, more weakly in the Poles, has\r\nalways been very poorly bred in the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians have\r\npossessed the tendency, peculiar to all lowland peoples, to level its\r\naspirations, to divert them to one side, but never to the subordination\r\nof their individuality to the interests of the state. Only when the\r\ngeneral equality of all citizens of the state opens to every man an\r\nequal field for the activity of his personal ego, have the Ukrainians\r\nbeen able to do the state-idea justice and to embody it very finely.\r\nThey have given the best proof of this in the Zaporog Cossack\r\norganization. This fact gives us the only hope that the Ukrainians may\r\nyet become an organized nation in modern times. The present manner of\r\nnational life is what the Ukrainians wished to have centuries ago—much\r\ntoo early, of course.\r\n\r\nIn view of the great uniformity, every rise of land is significant.\r\nSlight elevations, chains of hills, river valleys, even swamps and\r\nforests appear in the Ukraine as important boundaries, lines of\r\ndefence, foundations for cities and castles, fortified places, lookout\r\nstations, etc. Even the many barrows (mohili, kurhani) have played an\r\nimportant part in the history of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe anthropogeographical significance of the Ukrainian mountains is in\r\ngeneral slight, altho we find all the typical influences of the\r\nmountains in the mountain tribes of the Ukrainians. Great physical\r\nendurance, coupled with a feeling for liberty and independence, great\r\npersonal courage, great love of country, etc., have always\r\ndistinguished the Ukrainian mountain dwellers.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian Carpathians are, to this day, one of the most thinly\r\nsettled regions of the Ukraine, chiefly for the reason that it was\r\nalways a passive region, which was not considered in political life.\r\nGreat historical movements hardly ever touched the Carpathians. For\r\nmany centuries they remained almost devoid of human life. Hence, the\r\nCarpathians played hardly any part as a border defence of the Ukrainian\r\nstate organizations. Mountain chains usually are of very great\r\nimportance as a defence for individual tribes or entire races. The\r\nCarpathians, with their great ease of passage, especially in the\r\nUkrainian part, have been of no significance in this respect. They did\r\nprovide effective protection for the Walachian shepherds thru many\r\ncenturies. These shepherds led a nomad life with their flocks on the\r\nCarpathian pastures, and left proof of their presence in numerous names\r\nof mountains, rivers and villages. The Carpathians also provided\r\nshelter for the numerous Ukrainian fugitives who fled from oppressive\r\nserfdom and formed bands of half-political freebooters, friends of the\r\nlowly, and warriors against the lords (oprishki). The brigandage\r\npeculiar to all mountain regions flourished also in the Carpathians.\r\nBut no state originated in the Carpathians. The Alps were the\r\nfoundation of Switzerland, and played a part in the formation of the\r\nAustrian state. The Carpathians have given the Ukraine nothing, apart\r\nfrom occasional passing shelter.\r\n\r\nAt this point we must emphasize another anthropogeographical\r\ncharacteristic of the mountains. It is the general poverty of their\r\ninhabitants and their consequent desire, under compulsion, to seek\r\nexpansion. The inhabitants of the Ukrainian Carpathians, about the\r\nmiddle of the 19th Century, were in a serious economic condition\r\nbecause of the small amount of productive ground. Need came first to\r\nthe Lemkos, then to the Boikes, and last to the Hutzuls. Above all, it\r\npartly divested the mountain population of the then predominating\r\nindustry of cattle raising. The Lemkos at first carried on a lively\r\ntrade in wagon grease thruout the southern part of Eastern Europe, then\r\nthey turned to harvest work, in the surrounding lowlands, and last to\r\nthe annual emigration to America. The Boikes first carried on trade in\r\nsalt, then changed to the fruit trade, which they are carrying on\r\ntoday, down as far as Warsaw and Moscow. Very lately, the annual\r\nemigration to America has been depleting their ranks also. The Hutzuls\r\nhave but just begun to resort to emigration. They hire out less\r\nfrequently for agricultural work than for the lumber industry, in which\r\nthey are very skilful. Their highly developed domestic industry, which\r\nborders on the artistic, might provide them with rich support, but it\r\nis rather hindered than advanced by the determining factors of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the general influence of the ground formation on the\r\npeople, we must also consider the anthropogeographical significance of\r\nthe geological conditions of the country. They should not be\r\nunderestimated, as one might expect, while to overestimate them, as\r\nsome scholars have done, by even referring anthropological\r\ncharacteristics back to the geological composition of the country, is\r\nquite as bad; at all events very many of the living conditions of the\r\ninhabitants are dependent upon the geological make-up of the land. We\r\nshall skip over the great importance of the geological composition of\r\nthe country for the surface formations which it determines. We shall\r\npay attention only to the direct geological influences.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine possesses very great mineral treasures. The most important\r\nmineral deposits for the present time, namely, coal, iron, salt and\r\npetroleum, are very large in the Ukraine. Of all these mineral\r\ntreasures, however, only the salt deposits have had an historical\r\nsignificance, since far back in the period of the Kingdoms of Kiev and\r\nHalich they furthered active trade and commerce, and later favored the\r\ndevelopment of the Chumak organization. The other mineral treasure\r\nattained a greater importance only in the past century. When one\r\nconsiders today that the Ukraine furnishes almost three-fourths of the\r\ncoal and iron output of Russia, one can readily believe that the\r\nUkraine might some day become as great an industrial country as\r\nGermany, England or Belgium. A single glance at the mining map of the\r\nUkraine soon shows us, however, how small the regions containing this\r\nabundance of mineral wealth are in proportion to the entire territory.\r\nThen everyone can understand what the geological composition of the\r\ncountry means. It condemns the Ukraine forever to remain an\r\nagricultural country, altho it also permits the development of a\r\nconsiderable industry in several centers.\r\n\r\nThe same path of future development is outlined for the Ukraine by its\r\nfertile soil. Almost three-fourths of the Ukrainian territory lies\r\nwithin the Eastern European black-earth zone. The chornozyom, one of\r\nthe most fertile species of earth on the globe, makes the Ukraine the\r\nmost fruitful land of Europe. We need not wonder, therefore, that the\r\nUkrainians have, to this day, remained almost entirely an agricultural\r\npeople. The fertility of the soil must also remain the greatest wealth\r\nof the land into the remotest future. Now that the greatest grain lands\r\nof the earth, the American prairies and pampas, the Australian\r\nborder-steppes, etc., have been almost entirely subjected to\r\ncultivation, the extensive market production of grain must, in the\r\nnearest future, give way to intensive production. Then the importance\r\nof the Ukrainian black earth, which has maintained its great fertility\r\nfor thousands of years, will become even greater than it is today; and\r\neven today the Ukraine must be considered one of the main centers of\r\ngrain production.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of the Ukrainian soil has had several unfavorable as well\r\nas favorable results. Like a promised land, the Ukraine has always\r\nlured foreign conquerors and colonists. Its fertility has brought the\r\nUkraine much war and trouble. For centuries the fertile ground of the\r\nUkraine gave its own people only a part of its rich produce. To this\r\nday the foreign landowners and grain merchants demand the greater part\r\nof the harvest, while the native people of the Ukraine, who have dwelt\r\nin the land since time out of mind, can hardly reserve enough for\r\nthemselves to keep from dying of hunger.\r\n\r\nThe fertile Ukrainian ground has exerted another important unfavorable\r\ninfluence over the Ukrainian people. The great fertility of its fields\r\nhas caused a certain indifference and carelessness in planting among\r\nthe Ukrainian peasants. To be sure, the Ukrainian is a better farmer\r\nthan the White Russian, Russian or Roumanian. But for centuries he has\r\nbeen accustomed to depend on the fertility of his native soil and is,\r\ntherefore, far behind the progressive farmer of Central or Western\r\nEurope. Antiquated methods of planting have until recently prevailed in\r\nthe Ukraine without the slightest change. At the same time the ground\r\nhas become scant, and progressive methods of cultivation must be\r\nadopted in order to get as much as possible out of the land and to\r\nbalance the relative diminution of the cultivation area.\r\n\r\nThe geological conditions have also exerted a great deal of influence\r\nover the buildings and roads of the Ukraine. Clay houses, covered with\r\nstraw, are still typical for the Ukraine today. Only in the most recent\r\ntimes brick houses, covered with shingle, are beginning to appear in\r\nthe Ukrainian villages. Stone buildings were not original with the\r\nUkraine, and were only adopted with the higher grade of culture. The\r\ncause of this is not the lack of building material. Almost everywhere\r\nin the Ukraine good building-stone is found beneath the thick cover of\r\nloose earth. But the abundance of clay always showed the nearer and\r\neasier way—clay huts. Even this small matter has had an unhappy\r\ninfluence upon the fate of the Ukraine. The ancient Ukrainian cities\r\nconsisted chiefly of wood and clay buildings and were fortified by\r\nmeans of earthworks, palisades and clay covered wooden towers. Walled\r\nhouses and circular walls were very rare. This condition made the\r\ndefence of the cities and castles, even against the attacks of nomadic\r\ntribes, very difficult. The ancient Ukrainian State would not have been\r\ndestroyed so soon if it had had an abundance of strongly fortified\r\nwalled cities.\r\n\r\nThe black earth and clay sub-layer of the Ukraine has, since the most\r\nancient times, been an unfavorable influence as far as the quality of\r\nits roads are concerned. Outside of the negligence of the Polish and\r\nthe Russian State, which alternated in the domination of the Ukrainian\r\nterritory, natural conditions, too, have had a great deal to do with\r\nthe roads in the Ukraine. The stone lay far below the loose cover of\r\nclay; it was used very rarely for building purposes; hence the idea of\r\nplastering the roads with stones could hardly occur to anyone.\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the anthropogeographical significance of the\r\nUkrainian bodies of water. Of the importance of the Black Sea we have\r\nalready spoken. The Ukrainian people lived in close connection with\r\nthis sea in the days of the ancient Kingdom of Kiev, as well as in the\r\ndays of the Cossack organization. But the lack of well-developed coast,\r\nof harbors and islands, have prevented the development of the\r\nUkrainians into a seafaring nation, altho favorable tendencies were not\r\nlacking. The smallness and isolation of the Black Sea could not favor\r\nthe development of navigation. The frequency of dangerous storms had a\r\ndeterring effect, altho they strengthened the courage of the sailors.\r\nThen again, the smallness of the sea made the use of small vessels\r\nsufficient, which could more readily find shelter at any time or at any\r\npoint along the coast, with its few harbors, than larger ships. These\r\ncircumstances have hindered the development of extensive navigation for\r\nlong distance traffic. Hence, the Ukrainians, altho in certain periods\r\nof their history they gained a not inconsiderable familiarity with the\r\nsea, could not rise to a genuine seafaring people.\r\n\r\nMuch stronger ties connect the Ukrainian people with the rivers of its\r\nterritory. The rivers have an anthropogeographical significance chiefly\r\nas ways of travel. The great main streams of the Ukraine, particularly\r\nthe Dnieper and the Dniester, have always had the character of a\r\ntransition between rivers and arms of the sea. At the time of the\r\nancient Kingdom of Kiev, seafaring vessels sailing up the Dniester\r\nreached the royal city of Halich, and, in the time of the Cossacks, the\r\nZaporog boats were pursued by the Turkish galleys as far as the rapids\r\nof the Dnieper. As far as ancient navigation was concerned, there was\r\nvery little difference between river and sea; rivers were simply the\r\nextension of sea routes. In the ancient Ukraine, the Varangians were\r\nthe first to use them in this sense. Their route “from the Varangian\r\nLand to Greece,” which later became one of the main paths of the old\r\nKingdom of Kiev, led from the Baltic to the Black Sea by way of rivers\r\nand portages. These wanderings of the Varangians in the Ukrainian water\r\nsystem are of great historical significance. For altho we are now\r\nalmost certain that the Varangians were not the founders of the Kingdom\r\nof Kiev, it cannot be denied that they played a great part in the\r\nforming of it.\r\n\r\nRivers are natural, and therefore, also the easiest and cheapest roads.\r\nEspecially in countries of great area, as the United States, Russia and\r\nthe Ukraine, the importance of rivers as roadways is very great. Rivers\r\nconnect the nations. The Dniester and the Dnieper connected the Ukraine\r\nwith the sea, with the highly-cultured Constantinople, with the entire\r\nMediterranean and Oriental world of culture. The Dnieper, thru its much\r\nbranched water-web, connected the Ukraine directly with Poland and\r\nWhite Russia, and indirectly with the Baltic Sea and Northern Europe.\r\nEven today, altho the canals connecting the Dnieper with the Vistula,\r\nNiemen, and Dvina are entirely neglected, the Dnieper River plays a\r\nvery significant part as a great vein of traffic connecting different\r\nlands, peoples and producing regions. It may become more important\r\nstill if it is made accessible to sea vessels and connects two distant\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nIn the Cossack period a considerable portion of the Ukrainians became a\r\nriver people. The life and work of the Zaporog Sich depended entirely\r\nupon the Dnieper River. It protected, fed and clothed them. So strongly\r\nwere the Zaporogs bound to the Dnieper, so necessary did the great\r\nriver become to them, that all attempts to found new Zaporog centers on\r\nother rivers simply failed. We need not wonder, then, that the Dnieper\r\nis celebrated in all the Cossack songs as a sacred possession of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the character of rivers as roadways, is their\r\nimportance as the directing lines of the movements of races. The\r\nhistory of the Ukraine tells us how the ancient Kingdom of Kiev\r\npenetrated toward the south along the Dnieper, and how the Kingdom of\r\nHalich reached the delta of the Danube by way of the Dniester and Prut.\r\nMost likely the first expansion of the Ukrainians proceeded along the\r\nDniester, Boh and Dnieper, southward. At the time of the great shifts\r\nof the Ukrainian southeast border, the advance of the Ukrainians was\r\nalways directed southeast, their retreat always northwest. The history\r\nof the 16th Century shows plainly how the first pioneers of the new\r\ncolonization movement—the Cossacks—pushed along the Dnieper, toward the\r\nsoutheast, into the steppe region. Altho it is a commonplace, yet it\r\nmay be established without doubt that the whole Ukrainian nation took\r\nits way southeast along the Ukrainian rivers. To this day the national\r\nterritory of the Ukraine is advancing irresistibly in that direction.\r\n\r\nBut not only with the southeast has Nature connected the Ukraine.\r\nImportant borderlands of the Ukrainian territory—Central Galicia, the\r\nregion of Kholm, Podlakhia, Western Volhynia—with their river system,\r\nbelong to the Baltic slope. At the same time, the transition from the\r\nPontian river system to the Baltic system is very easy, the divides\r\nflat and low. The easy transition from the Dniester to the San and Buh,\r\nfrom the Pripet to the Vistula and the Niemen, was of great importance\r\nin the past, when western influences could easily penetrate these\r\nUkrainian borderlands, and is of great importance in the present. If,\r\nin the near future, the now antiquated canals are improved and new ones\r\nbuilt, the Ukraine will have as good connections with the west as it\r\nhas with the east. Then the Ukraine may, from a hydrographic point of\r\nview, gain great importance as a transition country of important\r\nwaterways.\r\n\r\nBy no means accidental is the remarkable fact that the Ukraine has no\r\nhydrographic connection with the northeast, the real Muscovite country.\r\nOf the country drained by the Don, only the region of the Donetz (which\r\nalso flows southeast) and the mouth of the main stream belong to the\r\nterritory of the Ukraine, and that only since a relatively short time.\r\nOutside of the Don region the Ukraine has no hydrographic connections\r\nwith the Muscovite country, which has always had different directions,\r\ndifferent channels of traffic, and different centers of waterways.\r\n\r\nModern geography does not consider rivers good natural boundaries, and\r\ndoes not believe in their powers of separation. In the Ukraine, rivers\r\nhave played almost no part as boundaries. Even the Pripet, surrounded\r\nas it is with inaccessible swamps, does not make a good natural\r\nboundary between the Ukraine and White Russia. The ethnographic\r\ninfluences on both sides, and even the political boundaries are hardly\r\nconsidered. Nor could the rivers be important lasting obstacles;\r\ninstead of separating they are more likely to connect individuals, and\r\neven whole nations. Only as passing, momentary obstacles, they were of\r\nimportance to the Ukraine in the innumerable wars which were waged on\r\nUkrainian soil, and much Ukrainian blood was carried by them to the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the relations between climate and people of the Ukraine.\r\nThe situation of the Ukraine at an equal distance from the equator and\r\nthe pole, on the southeast border of the European continent, which is\r\nso very favored climatically, has given the country one of the finest\r\nclimates of the temperate zone. The hot summer permits of an extensive\r\nexploitation of the ground, the severe winter hardens the body and\r\nstrengthens the soul, strong winds clear the atmosphere and bring\r\nmotion into nature. The amount of rainfall is sufficient for the\r\nvegetable world, and is as far removed from the superabundance of damp\r\nWestern Europe, as from the deadly dryness of the Asiatic steppes.\r\n\r\nAs for the general influence of the Ukrainian climate upon the people,\r\nit is in the main similar to that of Western and Central Europe. The\r\nUkrainians are one of the northern peoples of Europe, and they show it\r\nby the difficulty with which they become acclimated to the tropical\r\nconditions of Brazil and Argentina. There conditions are much worse for\r\nthe Ukrainians than for the Spaniards, Portuguese and Italians, but at\r\nleast better than for the English or Scandinavians. The Ukrainian is\r\nalready accustomed to a hot and long summer in his native land. He\r\naccustoms himself quickly and easily to the cold Siberian climate,\r\nbecause the frosts in the Ukraine, despite the short frost period, are\r\nvery severe. For climatic reasons then, the colonial capacity of the\r\nUkrainians must be even better than that of most of the peoples of\r\nWestern or Central Europe.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Ukraine, which we have discussed in a preceding\r\nchapter, is very uniform thruout the entire great territory, with the\r\nexception of the southern borders. This homogeneity is favorable on the\r\none hand, because it advances the homogeneity of the people,\r\nunfavorable on the other hand, because differences in climate as a rule\r\nenliven and quicken the course of history of a country. The variations\r\nin character of the people and in the mode of living due to the\r\ndifferences in climate give countless impulses to development and to\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nDespite the general uniformity of the climate, we do find appreciable\r\ndifferences when we compare the northern border regions of our country\r\nwith the southern ones. The Ukraine has the same climatic peculiarity\r\nas France on a small scale, the transition of the temperate to the\r\nMediterranean climate without sharply defined boundaries. In this way\r\nsome difference of products does arise, which advances the development\r\nof trade and commerce.\r\n\r\nIn our description of the Ukrainian climate, we emphasized its peculiar\r\nposition as compared with the climates of the adjacent districts of\r\nEastern Europe. Just beyond the borders of the Ukraine, to the north\r\nand east, the annual temperature becomes lower and the duration and\r\nseverity of the winter suddenly becomes very much greater. The\r\nMuscovite climate and that of the Ukraine would not be ranked together\r\nby anyone who understands anything about the matter. And yet the\r\nrenowned historian and publicist, Leroy Beaulieu, considers a uniform\r\nclimate as one of the chief causes of the unity of Russia. In January,\r\nhe writes, one may ride in a sleigh from Astrakhan to Archangel; the\r\nSea of Azof and the Caspian Sea freeze over just as the White Sea or\r\nthe Finnish Gulf, the Dnieper as well as the Dvina; the winter wraps\r\nnorth and south in one vast blanket of snow every year. Less strong are\r\nthe ties formed by the summer, but there is a preponderance of unifying\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nSuch statements can come only from one who has no conception of\r\nclimatology and anthropogeography. On such premises no conclusions may\r\nbe based, except by persons who have previously constructed a\r\nhypothesis and now wish at all costs, to prove its validity. For it is\r\ncertainly generally known that the same winter covers all Scandinavia,\r\nPoland, Germany and Northern France together with the same white\r\nmantle. In the winter-time one may travel by sleigh not only from\r\nAstrakhan to Archangel, but also to Irkutsk in one direction and to\r\nStockholm in the other, and even to Paris. Not only the Dnieper\r\nfreezes, but also the Vistula, the Oder, the Elbe, and sometimes even\r\nthe Seine. If we consider ice and snow as the basis of “unification,”\r\nvery little of Europe remains. For not only in snow and ice should we\r\nseek signs of uniformity in climate, but in its general character, in\r\nthe community of all climatic characteristics. It is true that the\r\nUkraine is part of the Eastern European climatic province, but in this\r\nprovince we may also include almost all of Sweden, almost all of\r\nPoland, a part of Austria-Hungary and Prussia, and Supan adds all of\r\nWestern Siberia, Caucasia and Turkestan as well. Every geographer\r\nunderstands that so great a climatic province must be divided into\r\nsmaller districts even in climatology, not to mention the details of\r\ndaily life. Every inhabitant of Southern Russia, whether a Ukrainian or\r\nnot, feels the difference of the Ukrainian climate from that of St.\r\nPetersburg or Moscow very keenly. There is hardly a Russian author who\r\ndoes not describe the fine climate of the Ukraine as wonderfully mild\r\ncompared to the inhospitable climate of his native land. How keenly,\r\nthen, does a Ukrainian feel the difference in the two climates, who is\r\nforced to live in the cold Muscovite country.\r\n\r\nThe climatic difference is illustrated more clearly still when we\r\nconsider the matter from the climatological side. Voyekov, the great\r\nRussian climato pzeshasiemlogist, expressly the slight cover of snow in\r\nthe Ukraine, the relatively high temperature of the warmer periods of\r\nthe winter, and the abnormally warm spring, which is due to the\r\nlightness of the snow-cover, which requires only a little of the spring\r\nwarmth to melt it. The snow cover of Poland, Lithuania or Northeastern\r\nGermany is much more similar to that of Muscovy than the Ukrainian. The\r\nJanuary isotherms in the Ukraine switch over from the N. to S.\r\ndirection to the N. W. to S. E. direction. The isotherm of the typical\r\nRussian winter (January -8 to -10°) avoids the region of the Ukraine\r\nentirely. It is true that the Dnieper and Dniester have the same amount\r\nof ice as the Volga or the Dvina. But here the main consideration\r\nshould be the period of freezing; the Dvina is covered over for 190\r\ndays, the Volga 160, the Dnieper in the Ukraine only 80 to 100 days,\r\nthe Dniester 70 days. These are certainly greater differences. Still\r\ngreater differences between the Ukrainian and the Muscovite climates\r\nbecome evident when we compare the length of the winter, or the time\r\nsuitable for work outdoors. In Great Russia this time is at most four\r\nmonths; in the Ukraine, at least six and a half; and in its southern\r\nborderlands even nine months. Such differences play a great part in the\r\nlife of the people. The time of the winter obstructions and enforced\r\nidleness is twice as great in Russia as in the Ukraine. The struggle\r\nwith the cold takes on forms in the Ukraine which are entirely\r\nanalogous to the Western European forms. In the Muscovite country we\r\nobserve polar elements in the winter-life of the people. The Ukrainian\r\nwinter does not depress the people, does not bore them to death, but\r\nonly steels their bodies in the struggle with the cold and gives them\r\nthe desired rest after the summer’s heat. The winter is the time of the\r\nmost intensive social life among the Ukrainian peasantry.\r\n\r\nThe spring of the Ukraine, warm and sunny, has quite a different\r\ninfluence upon people to that of the cool, damp Russian or Polish\r\nspring. The sunny climate of the spring and the cloudlessness of the\r\nsummer have produced in the Ukrainian a quiet, fundamentally cheerful\r\ntemper. Yet, we find in him none of the gaiety which is characteristic\r\nof the people of the south as compared with the people of the north,\r\nbut rather a quiet melancholy. It is just the Russians or the Poles\r\nthat are of a much gayer sort than the Ukrainians, livelier, more\r\neasy-going in their social life, more frolicsome; not the Ukrainians,\r\nbut the Russians and Poles, are the very ones that are vying with one\r\nanother for the epithet of the “Frenchmen of the North” or “of the\r\nEast,” respectively. (This remarkable fact is due, in the first place,\r\nto the unhappy history of the Ukraine). But, on the other hand, the\r\nmelancholy of the Ukrainians is quiet, while the occasional melancholy\r\nof the Russians turns into despair and pessimism.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian summer and fall, warm and beautiful, has made the\r\nUkrainian, in contrast with the Russian, a farmer par excellence. The\r\nwarmth of these seasons is very similar to Southern European\r\nconditions, and gives to the life of the Ukrainian people many southern\r\ncharacteristics. The life in open communion with Nature, the\r\naccessibility of her organic treasures, is much more pronounced in the\r\nUkraine than in Russia, White Russia or Poland. In the warm seasons the\r\nUkrainian lives much of the time outside his house. In the day he works\r\ncontinuously in the field or in the garden, and even at night he\r\nusually sleeps outdoors in the orchard or the yard. If the fields are\r\nat a distance from the village, a large part of the population of the\r\nplace camp out in the open fields for several days during harvest time.\r\nThese are all characteristics of the life of the south. Yet we see in\r\nour people no real characteristics of the people of the south. Despite\r\nall this, the Ukrainian is much more domestic than the Russian, more\r\nfrugal and more temperate; the “extravagant Russian nature” is entirely\r\nforeign to him. We have already seen that the Ukrainians do not have\r\ngay manners, and in like manner their activity of thought is less than\r\nthat of the northern peoples, the Russians and the Poles. Yet the depth\r\nof thought of the Ukrainians is much greater, and their popular poetry\r\nincomparably deeper than that of the Russians or Poles. Dreaminess and\r\nreserve of character is much greater in the Ukrainians who live in the\r\nsouth than in the Poles and Russians who live in the north. All these\r\nare the effects of a sorrowful past. Only in one respect do the\r\nUkrainians bear out their southern type of character; in their great\r\nabilities and their generally rich intellectual gifts. Every\r\nunprejudiced observer must admit that the Ukrainian peasant, almost the\r\nonly typical representative of our nation, surpasses almost all his\r\nneighbors in his natural accomplishments.\r\n\r\nThe laziness and weakness of will peculiar to the southern nations\r\ncompared to the northern, have not developed into a typical\r\ncharacteristic among the Ukrainians. The often remarkable indifference\r\nof the Ukrainian is rather an outgrowth of sad historical events than\r\nof the climate and the nature of the land in general. At most one might\r\nblame the great fertility of the black soil. For the faith in this\r\nfertility is almost never misplaced and favors the indifference of the\r\npeasant. On the other hand, the five hundred years of Tatar oppression\r\nwere actually able to produce an inherited indifference. And why strive\r\nand work, when at any moment the Tatar hordes might come and take or\r\nburn everything?\r\n\r\nDespite this historically inherited indifference, as we may call it,\r\nthe laziness peculiar to southerners cannot be ascribed to the\r\nUkrainians. They are better farmers than all their neighbors, with the\r\nsingle exception of those who adopted progressive farming, as, for\r\nexample, the Prussian Poles. Domestic industry is also well developed\r\namong the Ukrainians, and the Ukrainian seasonal workers are actually\r\nsought after, especially in Germany, and earn a great deal. The\r\nUkrainian harvest-worker is more sought after and better paid than the\r\nRussian. He works slowly but methodically, and achieves good results.\r\nThe Ukrainian colonists find tolerable living conditions in places in\r\nwhich the Russian starves to death or from which he flees.\r\n\r\nIn like manner weakness of will is not a real peculiarity of the\r\nUkrainians, in spite of their southern location. The thousand years’\r\nstruggle with piratical Asia, the independent establishment of two\r\ngreat state organizations, especially the second, after three centuries\r\nof slavery, the new awakening in the 19th Century under such difficult\r\nand hostile conditions, the splendid colonial expansion—all this speaks\r\nrather for great energy than for weakness of will. It is certainly true\r\nthat in our people, oppressed by centuries of serfdom, energy and\r\nstrength of character must hide beneath a thick crust of indifference,\r\nand our educated people find their energy weakened by the bad influence\r\nof foreign cultures. But these facts show most clearly that an enormous\r\namount of energy and willpower is latent in the Ukrainian people,\r\nwhich, to this day, however, has not been properly developed.\r\n\r\nAmong historians and anthropogeographers it is a much used commonplace\r\nthat the northern peoples always appear as conquerors who subjugate the\r\nsouthern peoples, and that they are always the founders of states in\r\ntheir particular climatic zones. The Germans overthrew the Roman\r\nEmpire, the Northern Frenchmen founded the French state, the Northern\r\nSpaniards the Spanish, the Northern Italians, the Italian state, and\r\nthe North Germans united Germany. It is natural, therefore, that this\r\ncommonplace should be applied also in Eastern Europe. The “Northern”\r\nRussians have, by the natural necessity of history, “united” the\r\n“southern” Russians. The same explanation should be accepted as a\r\nnecessity by the Ukrainians, and nothing should be done to resist this\r\ncondition!\r\n\r\nIn reality this commonplace, like so many others, is false. The\r\nUkrainians, as we have already observed, possess no such\r\ncharacteristics, as opposed to the Russians, as a southern race\r\npossesses with regard to a northern neighbor. To be sure, the Russian\r\nstate now dominates the Ukraine. But the present Russian state is,\r\nafter all, only a branch of the ancient Ukrainian Kingdom of Kiev. The\r\nancient Ukrainian Kingdom subjugated the present Russian territory,\r\norganized it as a state, even partly colonized it, and gave it a ruling\r\ndynasty. The ancient Ukrainian state tradition was usurped by the\r\nMuscovite states, and gave them all the prestige which the Muscovite\r\npossesses. It was only the Tatar invasion that entirely held up the\r\npolitical development of the Ukraine, and, at the same time, favored\r\nthe development of the Muscovite Empire. Only the Tatar invasion\r\nbrought Moscow the supremacy over the Ukraine which Russia still\r\nenjoys. It was a foreign conquest, which has nothing to do with\r\nclimatic influences. The very name of Russia only came into use in the\r\ntime of Peter the Great!\r\n\r\nFrom this survey of climatic influences, it appears, unequivocally,\r\nthat the Ukrainians cannot be classed with the so-called southern\r\npeoples. The Ukrainians have all the characteristics of the races of\r\nthe North Temperate Zone, who are the representatives of the European\r\nculture of today. The growth of national consciousness and of culture\r\nwill, without a doubt, raise the Ukrainians to the standard of the\r\nEuropean family of cultured nations. The nature of the country has, by\r\nmeans of its influences, given them all the necessary prerequisites.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the flora and fauna, for a lowland people like the\r\nUkrainians, should be considered very great. From the\r\nphysico-geographical description of the Ukraine, everyone will observe\r\nthat the Ukraine may be naturally divided into two main parts, the\r\nforest country and the steppe country. The mountain formations take up\r\nonly a comparatively small part of our territory.\r\n\r\nEven among the Ukrainians themselves, the opinion is very widespread\r\nthat they are a steppe-people. The enemies of the Ukraine have largely\r\nrepresented them in the eyes of Europe as a semi-nomadic steppe-people,\r\ndevoid of all culture, which thru their growth and development might\r\nthreaten the cultural treasures of Europe. These views, tho based\r\npartly upon the great part the steppe has played in the history of the\r\nUkraine, and partly upon the unquestionable fact that three-fourths of\r\nthe present Ukrainian territory lies within the steppe region of\r\nEastern Europe, are, nevertheless, incorrect. For, a glance at the\r\nfloral map of Europe is enough to show that the so-called old Ukraine,\r\nthat is, the original Ukrainian territory, lies almost completely\r\nwithin the forest region. That means Galicia, Kholm, Western Podolia,\r\nWestern Volhynia, Kiev, Chernihiv, etc. From here the most ancient\r\nUkrainian colonization advanced to the Black Sea, only to lose all the\r\nsteppe districts again upon the sudden nomad attack. For centuries the\r\nsteppes of the present Ukraine were the stamping-ground of\r\nMongolian-Turkish nomad tribes. The Cossack organization at last\r\nwrested great areas from them, and made these accessible to Ukrainian\r\ncolonization. And only the last colonial expansion of the Ukrainians\r\nhas been able to reach the Pontian shore again. The Ukrainians, then,\r\nwere originally a forest and wood-meadow people. They have become in\r\npart a steppe people, but only thru their latest colonial expansion.\r\nAnd, just as today we would not call the English or the North Americans\r\nsteppe peoples, merely because they colonized the American prairies and\r\nnow inhabit them, so we can no more call the Ukrainians a steppe\r\npeople, merely because they have colonized the Southern European\r\nsteppes.\r\n\r\nNot the steppe, but the forest and the wood-meadow are the native\r\nfloral conditions of the Ukrainian. In the forest zone and in the\r\nadjacent parts of the forest-meadow zone, the seed of the Kiev State\r\noriginated. In its expansion, this state first of all embraced the\r\nforest regions of the Ukraine, while the steppe regions were conquered\r\nlater and kept under the dominion of the state for a comparatively\r\nshort time only. The second center of the old Ukrainian historic life\r\nalso lies within the forest zone of the Ukraine, namely, the\r\nGalician-Volhynian. Even the center of Ukrainian historical life that\r\nextended farthest into the steppe, the Zaporog Sich, was dependent for\r\nits existence upon the great wooded areas of the Veliki Luh on the\r\nDnieper and its tributaries, and thus bound to the forest country.\r\n\r\nThe pronounced inclination of the Ukrainian people to agriculture, from\r\nthe most ancient times down to the present, is another proof that it is\r\na forest people, paradoxical tho it may seem. For it is an undisputed\r\nfact that, altho the steppes have apparently been most favorable to the\r\ncultivation of the grain grasses, and altho the present main centers of\r\nthe grain production of the world lie in the steppe country of the\r\nprairies, pampas, Ukraine, yet nowhere in the whole world have the\r\nsteppes brought forth an agricultural people. No steppe-people,\r\nanywhere, ever began agriculture of its own accord. The forest peoples\r\nhad to teach the steppe-races agriculture in the first place. Only in\r\ncase of bitter necessity do the inhabitants of the steppes take to the\r\nplough, and never has agriculture become part of their system to them.\r\n\r\nHow great was the part of the Ukrainian forest region in the past life\r\nof the nation has already been suggested in Book I. Only to the forests\r\ndoes the Ukrainian nation owe its preservation during the Tatar\r\nattacks. The forests were the only refuge of the people, to the forest\r\nzone the inhabitants of the steppes retreated whenever the steppes were\r\nthreatened by the nomads, moving back again at a favorable opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian forests have also been of great importance as boundaries.\r\nThe function of the forest to form important boundaries for races on a\r\nlow grade of culture is familiar to anthropogeography. In Ukrainian\r\nhistory, too, this characteristic of the forests has appeared\r\nprominently. The forests of the Ukrainian Polissye were of great\r\nimportance for the fencing-off of the East Slavic tribes, and by\r\nforming a wide zone, difficult of passage, separating the East Slavic\r\ntribes of the south from those of the north and west, they have\r\ncontributed a great deal to the formation of the three East Slavic\r\nnations of today. In the days of the ancient Kingdom of Kiev, the\r\ncenters in which the Muscovite nation later developed bore the name of\r\nSalissye (land behind the forest). There was a Pereyaslav Saliski,\r\nVladimir Saliski, etc.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the forest as a boundary has also made itself felt\r\nin the internal history of the Ukraine. For the grade of culture upon\r\nwhich the Ukraine remained thruout the Middle Ages and in the early\r\ncenturies of the modern era, the forests constituted good boundaries.\r\nThe forest divided the population into small groups, which lived apart\r\nin separate clearings, every group living its own life. The forest made\r\ncommunication difficult and did not permit the organization of a\r\npowerful central state. The forest character of the old Ukraine was the\r\nnatural chief cause of the formation of principalities in the ancient\r\nKingdom of Kiev, and advanced that fateful particularism. It is not by\r\nmere accident that Kiev lies on the border of the forest zone of the\r\nUkraine. Together with other causes, the thinner forests were an aid to\r\nthe more rapid development of the Kiev principality, and made it the\r\nnatural starting point for the great expansion under the reigns of\r\nOleh, Sviatoslav, Volodimir.\r\n\r\nFrom his original territory the Ukrainian took with him his great\r\npreference for trees, a love of trees which causes the white huts of a\r\ntypical Ukrainian village to be bordered with the fresh green of\r\nleaves. The green of the trees in which the Ukrainian huts disappear,\r\nenables us immediately to differentiate a Ukrainian from a Russian\r\nvillage, which seems to be afraid of trees.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the steppe is not originally native to the Ukrainian. The\r\nwords of the Cossack song, “The steppes so wide, the joyous land” were\r\nnot composed until the latter days of the Cossack organization. For\r\ncenturies the steppe meant to the Ukrainian the terrible, mysterious,\r\n“wild field,” from which at every moment the nomad hosts, like a swarm\r\nof locusts, invaded the Ukraine. The struggles of the Kingdom of Kiev\r\nwith the nomads show an anthropogeographer very plainly the reason of\r\ntheir final failure. The ancient Ukrainians, being forest dwellers,\r\nsimply could not successfully fight the riders on the natural steppe or\r\nthe artificial steppe of their own fields. The ancient Ukrainians did\r\nnot feel at home in the steppe. A long evolution was necessary before\r\nthe Ukrainians adapted themselves to the steppe, and the beginning of\r\nthis adaptation was the Ukrainian Cossack organization. Not until after\r\nthe formation and development of the Cossack organization could the\r\nUkrainian people successfully advance into the steppe zone and colonize\r\nit. Yet the denser settlement of the steppes did not take place until\r\ntoward the end of the 18th Century. Some of these early Ukrainian\r\nsettlements have, to this day, not lost the character of new colonies.\r\nBut these steppe districts were colonized by so great a mass of\r\nUkrainian colonists, and they increased so rapidly in the fertile\r\ncountry, that today more than half the Ukrainians live in the steppe\r\nzone, and thereby favor the widespread commonplace that the Ukrainians\r\nare a steppe people.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of its flora and fauna very soon enabled the Ukraine to\r\nprosper. Very early it was called a land “where milk and honey flows.”\r\nThis natural wealth of the organic world possessed the greater worth\r\nfor the reason that it was not soon exhausted, and offered, as it still\r\noffers, to the population, an opportunity for constant work, enduring\r\nactivity and steady development. The natural treasures of the Ukrainian\r\nterritory are not the treasures of tropical countries which favor\r\nlaziness, but the treasures of a more thrifty Nature, which require\r\nconstant work to properly exploit them.\r\n\r\nMan has changed the natural conditions of the flora and fauna of the\r\nUkraine to a great extent. These changes are not as fundamental as in\r\nWestern and Central Europe, but they have a great anthropogeographical\r\nsignificance. The forest zone of the Ukraine is thinned even beyond the\r\nnormal and in places destroyed. The artificial steppe of the cultivated\r\nland has penetrated very far to the north and west. Certain plant\r\nspecies have become rare, others have entirely disappeared, while, on\r\nthe other hand, new ones have been acclimated. The original wealth of\r\ngame of the Ukraine is a thing of the past now, and the great abundance\r\nof fish is almost all gone. On the other hand, man has increased the\r\nnumber of domestic animals enormously.\r\n\r\nAll these conditions give to the Ukraine characteristics of a\r\ncultivated country. As we shall see further on, the degree of\r\nexploitation of natural resources is still very low, much lower than in\r\nthe genuinely cultured countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, the Ukraine must be considered a land exceptionally\r\nendowed with riches by Nature. Up to the present day this has been a\r\nmisfortune, for from all sides strangers have come in to take with full\r\nhands of the riches of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nBut the time has come, at last, in which the possibility lies in the\r\nhands of the Ukrainian people to make use in the future of the rich\r\nresources of the Ukrainian land for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC-GEOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF UKRAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo give a lucid economic-geographical view of the Ukraine today is very\r\ndifficult—almost impossible. The Ukrainian territory is divided among\r\nthree states, and nowhere does the Ukrainian country form unbroken\r\nadministrative units. Consequently, the official statistics cannot give\r\nan exact picture of the economic conditions of the Ukraine. The\r\nfollowing attempt, also, can lay no claim to accuracy. A very\r\nheterogeneous and incomplete mass of material has made it impossible to\r\nattain the desired accuracy and uniformity.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine differs from the cultural countries of Central and Western\r\nEurope first, in that its settlement is not yet complete, so to say.\r\nOnly the northwestern regions of the “Old Ukraine” possess a sufficient\r\ndensity of population. The entire south and east are thinly, in places\r\neven very thinly, peopled. And the complete exploitation of the natural\r\nresources is still a far way off, even in the most thickly settled\r\nparts of the Western Ukraine.\r\n\r\nIn our economic-geographical survey of the Ukraine, we shall begin with\r\nthe most primitive branches of the exploitation of natural resources\r\nand proceed from them to those that are more advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTING AND FISHING\r\n\r\nThe most primitive way of exploiting the natural resources of a country\r\nhas always, and everywhere, been hunting and fishing. Both played a\r\ngreat part in the economic life of the Ukraine a thousand years ago.\r\nOur ancient chronicles contain many reports of the great abundance of\r\ngame and fish in the Ukrainian land, and of their great importance for\r\nthe population. Five centuries of Tatar warfare effectively interrupted\r\nthe exploitation of these natural treasures, and even in the 16th and\r\n17th Century the Ukraine still aroused the amazement of travelers from\r\nforeign lands, thru its great wealth of game and fish. In these\r\ncenturies, hunting and fishing were among the main branches of industry\r\nof the Cossack border population of the Ukraine. As late as the second\r\nhalf of the 18th Century, hunting and fishing were still two of the\r\nmain sources of industry of the Zaporog Sich. But soon agriculture\r\nbegan to gain ground in the regions ruled by it, the density of the\r\npopulation increased, and with it the fundamental strength of the\r\nZaporog organization. This circumstance seemed threatening to the\r\nRussian government, and was the chief motive for the destruction of the\r\nSich.\r\n\r\nToday hunting has almost no significance in the economic life of the\r\nUkraine. Altho in the year 1906, in Galicia, 500 stags, about 10,000\r\nroes, over 2000 boars, about 90,000 rabbits, over 8000 pheasants,\r\n50,000 partridges, 30,000 quail, 10,000 woodcocks, and 14,000 wild\r\nducks were killed, the figures for other countries at the same time\r\nwere much higher; in Bohemia which is more thickly populated there were\r\nbrought down more than 800,000 rabbits, 1,000,000 partridges, etc.\r\nThese figures show that in Galicia the natural wealth of game has\r\ndeclined considerably, while the artificial conservation of game has\r\nnot yet begun. In the Austro-Hungarian part of the Ukraine, hunting has\r\nbecome a mere diversion of the upper classes—a mere sport. The hunting\r\nmonopoly of the upper classes even bring to the country folk serious\r\ndisadvantages, for boars and stags cause great damage to agriculture,\r\nespecially in the Boiko and Hutzul country, and it is forbidden to keep\r\nthem off. This circumstance encourages poaching, which in many\r\ndistricts is quite common. The extermination of beasts of prey, bears,\r\nwolves, lynx and wildcats is as a rule, undertaken only in occasional\r\ngeneral chases, but the Ukrainian mountain-dwellers are very well able,\r\ndespite all game laws, to defend themselves and their herds effectively\r\nfrom these wild animals. In 1906 more than 9000 foxes were brought down\r\nin Galicia.\r\n\r\nIn the Russian Ukraine the economic importance of hunting is as slight\r\nas in Austria-Hungary. Nowhere in this region do we find a developed,\r\nprofitable hunting industry. Even in the Polissye hunting is not very\r\nimportant and is at most an avocation for a few forest settlers. Here\r\nrabbits, roes, boars, elk, grouse, wild fowl and water-game are\r\nsometimes hunted. Bison and beaver hunting is now very strictly\r\nforbidden. Many foxes and badgers are killed and a relatively large\r\nnumber of bears and wolves. Volhynia is much poorer in game, and still\r\npoorer are Podolia, and the districts of Kiev, Poltava and Kharkiv. In\r\nall the places, the most that one can get a shot at, aside from wild\r\nfowl, is rabbits and foxes, and sometimes wolves. In the forests and\r\nswamps of the Chernihov country there is a somewhat greater abundance\r\nof game. Hunting is most important, relatively, in the southern part of\r\nthe Ukraine, on the Black Sea border and in the Caucasus lands. Besides\r\nroes, rabbits, and foxes, there are hunted in the steppes: wolves,\r\nsayga-antelopes and wild dogs; and in the Caucasus: bison, stags,\r\nbears, and lynx. The number of steppe and waterfowl, e.g., bustards,\r\npartridge, quail, wild geese and wild ducks, and of mountain fowl, as\r\npheasants, mountain-quail, and grouse, is still considerable.\r\nCollecting the eggs of waterfowl is still a remunerative occupation. On\r\nthe shores of the Caspian Sea 130,000 Caspian seals are killed every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nOf much greater importance than hunting is the fishing industry. It is\r\nonly a weak reminiscence of what it once was, yet it remains to this\r\nday an important economic element. The Ukrainian fishing industry is\r\ncarried on in three regions: on the high sea, in the river-mouths, and\r\nin the interior of the land, in rivers, lakes and ponds.\r\n\r\nThe actual sea-fishing industry attains relatively slight results, on\r\nthe average 24½ million kilograms a year. On the Black Sea, along the\r\nshores of Bessarabia, Kherson and Tauria, a great amount of mackerel,\r\nsardines, herrings and sturgeon-like fish are caught. The main\r\nfisheries of the northern Pontian shore are situated at the Kinburn\r\nbar, at the island of Tendva, in the Bay of Karkinit, at Cape\r\nTarkhankut, at Eupatoria, Balaklava, Yalta, Sudak, and Theodosia.\r\nFishing on the high seas, because of its great cost, is undertaken only\r\nby the large enterprising companies, who hire the Ukrainian fishing\r\ncompanies (artili) for the entire summer. Of late, fishing on a small\r\nscale has begun to develop. The small fishermen catch chiefly mackerel,\r\nwhich are then salted, or, less often, smoked. They also go after the\r\nsmall but savory Black Sea oysters, of which an average number of one\r\nmillion a year are gathered.\r\n\r\nFar greater profit is yielded by the fisheries at the mouths of the\r\nrivers, in the limans, and particularly on the largest liman of all,\r\nthe Sea of Azof. The annual yield here attains an average of 140\r\nmillion kilograms. At the mouths of the Danube the chief fishing center\r\nis Vilkiv. Toward the end of the 19th century there lived at this place\r\n900 independent fisherman, who sometimes united to form artils. Here\r\nthey catch chiefly sturgeon and other fish of the sturgeon class (on\r\nthe average 30,000 a year), and four and a half million of Pontian\r\nherrings. At the mouths of the Dniester, Boh and Dnieper, chiefly river\r\nfish are caught. Herrings and sturgeon-like fish are of minor\r\nconsequence here. The fishermen in this region are always organized\r\neither in artils, in which the profits are shared equally among the\r\nmembers, or in so-called takhvi, which are hired by the entrepreneurs.\r\nThe chief center of the fishing trade and of the putting up of canned\r\nfish, is Odessa. Yet the Bay of Odessa cannot compare with the Sea of\r\nAzof in fish production. The average value of the annual haul here\r\nexceeded a million rubles in the latter years of the 19th Century. Over\r\n11 million kilograms of sturgeon-like fish and other large fish,\r\nbesides 7 million herrings, were caught here annually. In some winters\r\nmore than 70,000 fishermen, with 20,000 to 30,000 horses and oxen,\r\ngather on the frozen Sea of Azof. With gigantic nets, which are\r\nsometimes nearly two kilometers long, a very profitable fishing\r\nindustry is carried on here. Important fishing centers, with great\r\nfreezing plants and works for salting and smoking, are situated in Osiv\r\n(Azof) and Kerch. The members of the fisher artils come principally\r\nfrom the Poltava and Kharkiv country.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainians may also claim a rather prominent part in the fishing\r\nindustry of the Caspian Sea, which yields more than half a billion\r\nkilograms of fish annually. The Ukrainian Caspian fishermen come from\r\nUkrainian colonies on the Volga, and from the eastern parts of the\r\nUkraine proper.\r\n\r\nThe interior fishing industry on the rivers, lakes and ponds now has\r\nonly slight significance. On the Dniester and Dnieper on the Pripet,\r\nDesna, Sula and Orel, and on the Donetz there still exist here and\r\nthere fisher-artils, but the fish are caught only for local use. In the\r\nPolissye region the fishing industry still yields some profit, e.g., in\r\nthe District of Mosir about 40,000 rubles a year, in the District of\r\nPinsk only 3500 rubles. Lake Knias yields 10,000 rubles worth of fish\r\nannually. All of Galicia yields about 1,500,000 kilograms a year, of\r\nwhich two-thirds are contributed by the Ukrainian part of the country.\r\n\r\nIn examining the fishing industry of the Ukraine one cannot escape\r\nreminiscences that are painful. Everywhere a ruthless system of pillage\r\nand waste is carried on. The excessively fine meshes of the nets catch\r\nthe young broods of fish with the old, and these are either sold for a\r\nfew kopeks a pound or simply thrown away. The fish which come up the\r\nrivers to spawn are ruthlessly intercepted. A closed season or region\r\nbarely exists, except on paper. We need not wonder, therefore, that the\r\nabundance of fish in the Ukraine is rapidly decreasing, and fishing is\r\nlosing its importance more and more. Not a soul thinks of a rational\r\nmethod of breeding fish, of increasing the stock of fish in the\r\nstreams. In Galicia a start has been made, but thus far the results are\r\nvery slight. And yet the Ukraine, being an almost exclusively\r\nagricultural country, where there is no factory sewage to poison the\r\nrivers, could very easily recover its fame as a land abounding in fish.\r\n\r\nThe related industry of crab-fishing is not developed in the Ukraine,\r\naltho the Jewish dealers of Eastern Galicia send whole wagon-loads of\r\ncrabs from Galician and Russian Podolia to the west. The old Zaporog\r\nregions have been famous since ancient times for their abundance of\r\ncrabs. In Oleshki there also exists a drying-plant for crabs’ tails.\r\n\r\nFrom this short survey of the hunting and fishing industry of the\r\nUkraine, we perceive that these branches of industry play only a small\r\npart in the economic life of the Ukrainian population. A further proof\r\nof this fact is the small percentage of the population which engages in\r\nthis work. This percentage amounts to 0.2% in the Russian-Ukraine; in\r\nthe Austrian Ukraine it must be much smaller still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORESTRY\r\n\r\nHow extensive the wooded area of the Ukraine is cannot be determined\r\nexactly without detailed investigation, for the same reason that\r\nstatistical figures concerning the Ukraine in other fields are\r\ndifficult to determine. An approximate calculation of the forest\r\nsurface gives us an area of over 110,000 square kilometers, that is 13%\r\nof the entire surface of the country. These figures show us that the\r\nUkraine is one of the more sparsely-wooded countries of Europe. Of all\r\nthe larger territories of our continent, only England, with its 4%, is\r\npoorer in forests. There remain only smaller territories, as Portugal\r\n(2.8%), the Netherlands (8%), Denmark (8.3%), Greece (9.3%). So old a\r\nland of culture as France still possesses 15.8% forest surface, Germany\r\n25.9%, Hungary 27.4%, Austria 32.7%, Russia 38.8%. Among the large\r\nterritories, the United States stand nearest to the Ukraine as far as\r\ntheir forest area (10.3%) is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the comparative lack of forests in the Ukraine are to be\r\nsought, first of all, in the fact that it includes large parts of the\r\nsteppe region of Eastern Europe. The percentage of forest land in the\r\nvarious regions of the Ukraine show us this most clearly. The mountain\r\nregions still retain the highest proportion of forest. The Bukowina has\r\n42% of forest (District of Kimpolung 78%), the Ukrainian region of\r\nNortheastern Hungary about 40% (Marmarosh 62%). Then come the Ukrainian\r\nregions of the forest zone: Polissye, from Minsk down 38.2%, Volhynia\r\n29.6%, Galicia 25.4%, Grodno 25.5, Podlakhia, starting from Lublin,\r\n25.1%, from Sidletz 19.8%. In the same class, as far as forest area is\r\nconcerned, the Kuban region seems to stand. Besides the heavily wooded\r\nmountain region, this division includes the luhi in the foothill\r\ncountry and the treeless steppes; hence the percentage comes out very\r\nsmall—19.8%. The transition between the forest and the steppe zone is\r\nindicated by the following series: Kiev 18%, Chernihiv 15%, Podolia\r\n10.9%, Kharkiv 8.5% of forest area. The steppe regions of the Ukraine\r\nhave very little forest land: Kursk 7.1%, Voroniz 6.8%, Bessarabia\r\n5.8%, Tauria (Yaila forests) 5.7%, Poltava 4.7%, Katerinoslav 2.4%, the\r\nDon region the same, Kherson 1.4%, Stavropol 0.3%.\r\n\r\nIn this distribution of forest we see a certain analogy between the\r\nUkraine and the United States. Here the steppes are treeless, there it\r\nis the prairies. Here the forest predominates in the Carpathians, there\r\nin the Appalachians; here, just as there, we have zones of transition\r\nfrom forest regions to the steppes. But there is another point of\r\nsimilarity between the Ukraine and the United States—the ruthless\r\nexploitation and waste in forestry. This criminal waste is the second\r\nmain cause for the lack of forests of the Ukraine. It began in the 16th\r\nCentury and it still continues today. Historical sources mention great\r\nforest formations, even in those regions of the Ukraine which are now\r\npoor in forests. The “Great Forest” (veliki luh) in the Zaporog land,\r\nthe “Black Forest” at the sources of the Inhul, the large forests of\r\nthe Poltava and Kharkiv region, the Derevlan jungles, the gigantic\r\nforests on the Buh and Vislok, in the Rostoche, all have either\r\nentirely disappeared from the earth’s surface or have changed into\r\nmiserable remnants, which, at any moment, may fall a final victim to\r\nhuman greed. A host of geographical names, in regions which are almost\r\nentirely treeless today, point to former forests. Thick, primitive oak\r\ntrunks are found in the beds of rivers which flow only thru the\r\ntreeless steppe-region. In five decades, in the second half of the 19th\r\nCentury, the forest area of the Government of Kharkiv decreased from\r\n10.9% to 8.5%, in Poltava from 13% to 4.7%, Chernihiv from 17.1% to\r\n15%. Detailed investigations of the ground have proved that the forest\r\narea of the District of Poltava was originally 34% (now 7%), of the\r\nDistrict of Romny 28% (now 9%) and of the District of Lubni 30% (now\r\n4%). Similar conditions of forest devastation prevail everywhere in the\r\nUkraine. Thus, the forest area of Galicia, for example, has decreased\r\nby 2000 square kilometers, i.e., almost 3% of the total surface area of\r\nthe country, in the course of the last century.\r\n\r\nWe have already frequently called attention to the sad results of this\r\ncriminal waste for the entire land. But, because of the low grade of\r\nculture of the nations dominating the Ukraine, the Polish nation and\r\nthe Russian, no attention is paid to the fatal results of forest\r\ndestruction. The forests are recklessly cut down for lumber, and year\r\nby year the scarcity of wood is being felt in most regions of the\r\nUkraine. Only in Podlakhia, Volhynia, Polissye, and in the mountain\r\nregions of the Ukraine, is there no scarcity of wood. The three cubic\r\nmeters of wood which, on the average, are due every inhabitant of the\r\nUkraine, are not easily accessible to more than one-fifth of the\r\nUkrainians. At the same time, the forests of the Ukraine are, as a\r\nrule, badly managed. Even in the Austro-Hungarian parts of the Ukraine\r\nthere are very few professional foresters; in Galicia for example, 250\r\nto 800. Conditions are still worse in the Russian-Ukraine.\r\nConsequently, the forest does not grow up again very well, and a great\r\ndeal of wood is simply ruined. This happens chiefly in the mountain\r\nforests of the Carpathians, where hundreds of thousands of cubic meters\r\nof wood decay every year. In the regions which are poor in forests, the\r\nproducts of the woods are carefully and economically used, so that, for\r\ninstance, from one hectare of forest in the Poltava region, 11.5 cubic\r\nmeters of wood are produced every year; in the region of Katerinoslav,\r\n7 cubic meters. Of the production of the Ukrainian forest, building\r\nwood constitutes only a comparatively small part. There is a crushing\r\npreponderance of firewood, especially in the regions which are poor in\r\nforests. Building wood, in large quantities, comes from the forests of\r\nthe Polissye and of the Carpathians only. The export of building wood\r\nfrom Galicia and the Bukowina reached a million and a half cubic meters\r\nannually at the end of the century. The export of wood from the\r\nPolissye, starting from Minsk, exceeded 900,000 cubic meters. The\r\ncomplete production of Galicia in the year 1900 was 3,660,000 cubic\r\nmeters of building wood and an equal quantity of firewood.\r\n\r\nThe reclaiming of forests, even in the Austrian Ukraine, where it is\r\nrequired by law, is not properly administered. It is still worse in the\r\nRussian Ukraine. Hence, the forest surface of the Ukraine is constantly\r\ndecreasing instead of remaining unchanged or even increasing, as\r\nusually happens in the cultured lands of Europe. And yet, the Ukraine\r\nis one of those countries in which the forest problem is a life\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian people engage in the Ukrainian lumber industry only as\r\nlabor-power, while the money profit goes to strangers—great landowners\r\nor middlemen. The forest-area which is in the possession of Ukrainian\r\npeasants is very small, even in Galicia, where at the time of the\r\nremoval of the labor tax system, at least small patches of forest came\r\ninto the possession of the peasant communities. Almost all the forests\r\nof the Ukraine belong to the large landowners, the clergy and the\r\nnational lands.\r\n\r\nThe lumber industry and the industrial exploitation of the forest\r\nproducts engages but a slight part of the Ukrainian people. In the\r\nRussian Ukraine the percentage of such workers is barely 0.1%. In this\r\npercentage, however, the entire mass of Ukrainian peasants which seeks\r\nits incidental profit in forest work, is not considered. In the\r\nCarpathian regions of the Ukraine this percentage increases a\r\nhundredfold and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nSince the very first beginnings of the history of the Ukraine, the main\r\noccupation of its people has been, and has remained to this day,\r\nagriculture. To give a complete picture of Ukrainian agriculture is\r\nbeyond the scope of our little book. Even a detailed economic study\r\ncould not do justice to this task. Hence, we shall have to limit\r\nourselves to its most important phases.\r\n\r\nAlmost nine-tenths of the Ukrainian people are engaged in agriculture.\r\nIn the Russian Ukraine, the agricultural percentage of the population,\r\naccording to official estimate, is 86.4%. This figure is probably\r\ncorrect for the Austrian-Ukraine as well, altho the biased calculations\r\nof Buzek place the percentage of farmers among the Ukrainians of\r\nGalicia at 94.4%. These figures show us very clearly the significance\r\nof agriculture in the economic life of the Ukraine. Now, a person\r\nseeing these figures and knowing the fertility of the Ukraine might\r\neasily imagine that agriculture here stands upon a high plane. Such a\r\nview, however, would be entirely false. Agriculture is on a very very\r\nlow plane in the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nYet the causes of this sad state of affairs do not lie in the nature of\r\nthe land. The climate of the Ukraine favors the cultivation of grains\r\nas no other does. Barely one small part of the steppe-zone is\r\nunfavorable to agriculture, because of its frequent periods of drought.\r\nThe soil of the Ukraine is one of the most fertile on the whole globe.\r\nMore than three-fourths of the Ukraine lies in the Black Earth Region,\r\nand many varieties of soil in the northwestern part of the Ukraine are\r\nby no means without value and at least equal to the best soils of\r\nGermany. Not in Nature, but in the cultural conditions, lie the causes\r\nof the low grade of Ukrainian agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe first and main cause is the lack of enlightenment among the people\r\nof the Ukraine. The Ukraine peasant cultivates his field entirely after\r\nthe manner of his forefathers, which may have proved excellent a\r\nhundred years ago, and actually did make the Ukrainian peasant appear\r\nas the best farmer among his neighbors of other races, but they fail\r\ncompletely in these days of intensive cultivation of the soil. The\r\nilliteracy of the Ukrainian peasant renders almost inaccessible to him\r\nall the great progress of agricultural science. The old methods of\r\ncultivation, the primitive agricultural implements, waste his energy\r\nand his stock of living resources. The use of agricultural machines,\r\nwhich may be of great significance even in intensive farming on a small\r\nscale, is almost unknown to the Ukrainian peasant. The progressive\r\namelioration of the soil and the national rotation of crops is not at\r\nall of wide application. And all efforts at enlightening the Ukrainian\r\npeasantry are hindered as much as possible by the governments\r\ndominating them, by their Polish and their Russian masters.\r\n\r\nThe highest level, relatively, in agriculture, is attained by the\r\nwestern borderlands of the Ukraine, Podlakhia, the Khohos country, and\r\nGalicia. The poorer quality of the soil has always required more\r\nintensive cultivation here. Besides, the influences of advanced methods\r\nof cultivation sifted thru more easily here, whether indirectly thru\r\nthe Polish territory, or directly thru the influence of the German\r\ncolonies. The greater enlightenment of the Ukrainian peasants of\r\nGalicia has brought it about that they now regularly apply rational\r\nrotation of crops and fertilization of the soil, even with artificial\r\nfertilizers, and possess pretty good agricultural implements. The\r\nthree-field system has disappeared almost everywhere in this region,\r\nand continues in use only in the most fertile parts of Podolia. In the\r\nmountains, on the other hand, making land arable by means of fires\r\nfollowed immediately by planting, is still a procedure frequently met\r\nwith. In the Polissye region burning is still frequently applied, but\r\nthe two-field and three-field systems are used more frequently. On the\r\nsame principle, agriculture is carried on in the northern parts of\r\nVolhynia, Kiev and Chernihiv. In the southern parts of these districts,\r\nas well as in Podolia, Poltava and Kharkiv, the three-field system\r\npredominates. Manuring is usually confined to small plots directly\r\nadjoining the farmhouse. Here, too, however, an advance to rational\r\nrotation of crops and to the multi-field system is undeniable. In the\r\nsteppe zone the method of cultivation becomes more careless and the\r\nso-called fallow-system prevails. The steppe soil is cultivated for a\r\nnumber of years and then left lying fallow for some time. In very\r\nrecent years, however, even the steppe-peasant has had to face the hard\r\nnecessity of going on to the intensive methods of cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural implements of the Ukrainian peasants have undergone a\r\ngreat change. The primitive wooden plough, without metal mounting, has\r\nbeen retained only in places, in the Polissye region and the Carpathian\r\ncountry, more as a relic of the fathers than as an agricultural\r\nimplement. In the entire central zone of the Ukraine, the typical\r\nUkrainian plough, made of wood, with strong iron fittings, is used.\r\nIron ploughs are rapidly coming into use. In the southern steppe zone\r\nof the Ukraine, the peasant has by far the best implements. Iron\r\nploughs of different kinds are used here, in imitation of the German\r\ncolonists, while sowing, harvesting, and also threshing machines are\r\nfound as the property of large farmers or of agricultural co-operative\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, then, to note a certain progress in Ukrainian\r\nagriculture. The Russian and White Russian peasant is much more badly\r\noff, but the Ukrainian peasant, too, has a long way to go in order to\r\nreach the level of even the Ukrainian large landowners. Various\r\nagricultural co-operative associations are working to raise the\r\nstandard of agriculture among the Ukrainian peasantry. One of these\r\nco-operative associations has 90 branches, 1100 local groups, and\r\n27,000 members—the Eastern Galician “Silsky Hospodar.” Such\r\nassociations would, if not hindered in their development (especially by\r\nthe Russian Government), become of great importance in raising the\r\nlevel of the agricultural industry of the Ukraine, that ancient granary\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of the sad condition of Ukrainian agriculture lies in\r\ntheir unsound property conditions. The foreign conquerors, who were\r\ncontinually attracted by the fertility of the Ukrainian land, after\r\ntaking possession of the land, divided it among their upper classes.\r\nThe foreign conquerors have succeeded in denationalizing the Ukrainian\r\nnobility, have succeeded even in developing the republican Cossack\r\norganization into a new class of landowners and, very largely in\r\nrussifying them. Foreign rule in the Ukraine has always supported\r\nforeign ownership of land on a large scale, and the Ukrainian peasant\r\nmust be satisfied with small, mediocre and widely scattered bits of\r\nland.\r\n\r\nNow for a few corroborative figures. In the Ukrainian part of Galicia\r\nthe large estates embrace 40.3% of the total area. In the Governments\r\nof Chernihiv, Poltava and Kharkiv, the proportion of peasant-owned land\r\nis still rather large (53%, 52%, 59%), because here the property of\r\ndescendants of the old-time Cossacks is included. Far worse are the\r\nconditions in other parts of the Ukraine. In Volhynia the peasant-owned\r\nland constitutes only 40% of the area, in Podolia 48%, in Kiev 46%, in\r\nKherson 37%, in Katerinoslav 45%, in Tauria 37%, while in the Polissian\r\nGovernment of Minsk the peasants retain only 28% of the land.\r\n\r\nThe results of such unsound property conditions are fatal to the\r\never-increasing density of the peasant population. Land-famine has\r\nbecome chronic all thru the Ukraine. The parcelling out of the large\r\nestates which began with such fine results in Galicia a few years ago\r\nhas now come to a halt, and the Stolypin radical agrarian reform in the\r\nRussian Ukraine has thus far only slight results to show. To be sure,\r\nthe amount of property of the medium landowners is decreasing, but the\r\ngiant estates are not only not losing ground, but even show a steady,\r\ntho gradual, growth.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the ever increasing scarcity of land, the Ukrainian\r\npeasants are splitting up their property more and more, trying to rent\r\nas much land as possible from the large landowners, and seeking\r\nsubsidiary occupations in domestic work; but a large percentage find it\r\nnecessary to leave their fatherland and to seek homes in Caucasia,\r\nTurkestan, Siberia, Canada, Brazil and Argentina. And this sad fact\r\nneed not amaze us. For, while the foreign colonists who settled in\r\nSouthern Ukraine upon the invitation of Catherine II were given 65\r\nhectares of land per head, the Ukrainian peasant, after the abolition\r\nof serfdom, in 1861, was given a maximum of 3½ hectares, and in many\r\ncases only 1½ hectares per head. In half a century the rural population\r\nhas doubled, while the area of cultivation has not increased\r\nperceptibly at all. Thus, there existed in the Government of Poltava,\r\nas early as twenty years ago, more than 60% of peasant-farms with an\r\narea of cultivation of only 1.3 desiatins, while another four percent\r\nof estates occupied more than 5 desiatins. How can one speak of\r\nprogressive farming under such property conditions? Those 60% of\r\npeasant farms resemble very closely the sort of plots occupied by\r\ncottagers or squatters. And the consequence: 62% of the emigrants who\r\nemigrated to Russian Asia in 1910 came from the Ukrainian governments,\r\nthat “granary” of Russia. And not only from the thickly populated\r\ndistricts of Kiev or Poltava, but also from the comparatively thinly\r\npopulated, very fertile districts of the Ukraine—from Kherson,\r\nKaterinoslav and Tauria.\r\n\r\nThe third reason for the sad condition of Ukrainian agriculture, is the\r\ncommunity ownership of land established in the Eastern Ukraine. The\r\nbasis of their system, which is in vogue everywhere in Great-Russia, is\r\nthat the land is not owned by the individual peasant, but by the entire\r\ncommunity, which apportions it among its individual members. This\r\nMuscovite property system is unbearable to the Ukrainian peasant and\r\ncauses him to neglect his land, since it does not really belong to him.\r\nIt does not pay him at all to cultivate the ground better than his\r\nneighbor, since, in the new apportionment, the carefully improved patch\r\nmay fall to someone else.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, despite all these unfavorable conditions, the\r\nagricultural production of the Ukraine and its exports of food stuffs\r\nare very great, this fact is due, above all, to the great fertility of\r\nthe Ukrainian soil and the economic policy of the large landowners,\r\nwho, in spite of the frequent danger of famine in their own country,\r\ncontinue to export the products of their great estates beyond the\r\nborders of the land.\r\n\r\nAfter these general observations, we proceed to a short survey of\r\nagriculture in the Ukraine. None of the European countries (with the\r\nexception of Russia) possesses as great an area under cultivation as\r\nthe Ukraine. It amounts to more than 45 million hectares, that is, more\r\nthan 32% of the area of cultivation of European Russia, which is six\r\ntimes as large as the Ukraine. The proportion of the area of\r\ncultivation in the Ukraine is nearly 53% of the total area of the\r\ncountry. In this respect the Ukraine is surpassed only by France (56%).\r\nIn Germany, the proportion is only 48.6%, in Austria 36.8%, in Hungary\r\n43.1%, in Russia 26.2%. To be sure, the proportion of the cultivated\r\narea is very different in different districts of the Ukraine. The most\r\nagricultural land is found in the steppe and transition regions:\r\nKherson 78%, Poltava 75%, Kursk 74%, Kharkiv 71%, Voroniz and\r\nKaterinoslav 69% each, Podolia and Tauria 64% each, Bessarabia 61%,\r\nKiev 57%, Chernihiv 55%. The forest regions possess much less farm\r\nland: Galicia 48%, Grodno 40%, Volhynia 37%, Minsk 24%, etc. Besides\r\nthis, the farm land within each of the above mentioned regions is\r\ndiversely distributed. In Galicia, for example, the area of cultivation\r\nis apportioned as follows: In Eastern Podolia 75–80%, in Western\r\nPodolia 60–75%, in Pidhirye only 20–30%, in the Hutzul country only\r\n10%, of the total area. Similar conditions prevail in the Bukowina, in\r\nUpper Hungary, Caucasia. In the level regions of the Ukraine these\r\nlocal differences are slighter.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the general agricultural production of the Ukraine is\r\ndifficult, if not impossible. By combining various reports, we get, for\r\nthe yearly average in the beginning of the 20th Century, a grand total\r\nof 150 million metric hundred weights. (This number, however, includes\r\nonly the wheat, rye, and barley production.) In this respect, the\r\nUkraine surpasses all the countries of Europe except Russia. Its\r\nproduction is greater than that of Austria, Hungary or of France, to\r\nsay nothing of other European States.\r\n\r\nFollowing are several figures about the harvest yield of the Central\r\nregions of the Ukraine in 1910. Volhynia produced 73.4 million puds (1\r\npud = 16.4 kilograms), Kiev 113.4, Podolia 115.9, Kherson 188.6,\r\nChernihiv 40, Poltava 113.6, Kharkiv 95.9, Katerinoslav 194.9, Tauria\r\n138.3, Kuban 214.4 million puds. The total yield of the central regions\r\nof the Ukraine (without the borderlands, which also produce a great\r\ndeal, as for example, parts of Kursk, Voroniz, the Don region, etc.)\r\ntotalled 215 million metric hundred weights, and was, consequently, six\r\ntimes as great as the harvest yield of Russian Poland, and comprised\r\n39% of the total production of European Russia and over 33% that of the\r\nentire Russian Empire. If we consider now that the Russian Ukraine\r\ncomprises only a twenty-ninth part of the gigantic Russian Empire and\r\nbarely one-fourth of its population, we recognize the great importance\r\nattached to the Ukraine as the granary of Russia.\r\n\r\nAmong the species of grain grown in the Ukraine, wheat is without doubt\r\nof the first importance. In the Southern Ukraine wheat takes up half\r\nthe area of cultivation, decreasing rapidly toward the north and west.\r\nIn the Government of Kherson the wheat fields cover 51% of the\r\ncultivated surface, in Katerinoslav 50%, in Tauria and in the Don\r\nregion 49%, in Bessarabia 36%, in Podolia 30%, in Kharkiv 29%, in\r\nPoltava and in Kiev 22%, in Galicia 14%, in Volhynia 11%, in Grodno 4%,\r\nin Minsk 3%, in Chernihiv only 1%. In Kiev, Podolia, Volhynia, Galicia,\r\nmore winter wheat is raised; in the Southern Ukraine, more summer\r\nwheat. The mean annual yield per hectare is 10½ hl. for winter wheat\r\nand 7½ hl. for summer wheat. The mean annual yield of wheat in the\r\nfirst decade of the 20th Century in Russian Ukraine was 68 million\r\nmetric quintals, that is, over 46% of the production of European\r\nRussia. (In Eastern Galicia it was 1.9 million q.). The chief centers\r\nof wheat production in the Ukraine are Kuban (17 million q.),\r\nKaterinoslav (12.4 million q.), Kherson (12.4 million q.), Tauria (9\r\nmillion q.), Poltava (6.3 million q.), Podolia (5.8 million q.),\r\nKharkiv (4.9 million q.), Kiev (4.2 million q.), Stavropol (3.3 million\r\nq.), and Volhynia (2.7 million q.). Wheat is one of the chief exports\r\nof the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nRye is cultivated chiefly in the northern and western districts of the\r\nUkraine, where it is the chief grain used for breadmaking. In\r\nChernihiv, Minsk and Grodno, rye takes up 48% of the farm land, in\r\nVolhynia 38%, in Poltava 3%, in Kharkiv 29%, in Kiev 28%, in the Don\r\nregion 22%, in Katerinoslav and Podolia 19%, in Tauria 18%, in Kherson\r\nand Galicia 17%, in Bessarabia only 7%. Rye (almost everywhere winter\r\nrye) yields on the average 10½ hl. per hectare. The chief districts of\r\nproduction are Poltava (55 million q.), Volhynia (4.9 million q.), Kiev\r\n(4.8 million q.). The total rye output of the Ukraine is as high as 42\r\nmillion q., that is, over 20% of the Russian output.\r\n\r\nBarley is raised mostly in the Southern Ukraine, where it takes up 28%\r\nof the farm land in Tauria, 26% in Katerinoslav, 21% in Kharkiv and\r\nKherson, 18% in Bessarabia, 17% in the Don regions. The chief districts\r\nof production are Katerinoslav (9.2 million q.), Kherson (7.9 million\r\nq.), and Kuban (6.9 million q.) Barley is also an important export of\r\nthe Southern Ukraine. In other regions of the Ukraine less barley is\r\nraised, e.g., in Poltava 13%, in Polissye and in Galicia 9%. The barley\r\nproduction of the Russian Ukraine amounts to 49 million q., therefore\r\n61% of the Russian production of barley.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the remaining grains is, of course, comparatively\r\nslight. Oats take up on the average 16% of the farm land in the Ukraine\r\n(21% in the Polissye region, 17% in Galicia, 16% in Chernihiv, 11% in\r\nKharkiv and Poltava, 5% in Southern Ukraine). The total production is\r\n28 million q. Kiev, Volhynia and Poltava take first rank. As a bread\r\ncereal, oats are of some importance only among the Carpathian people of\r\nthe Ukraine. The Eastern Galician oats production amounts to 4.5\r\nmillion q. Spelt is raised very seldom and then only along the western\r\nborders of the Ukraine. Buckwheat is of the greatest importance in the\r\nChernihiv country (about 27% of the farm area and a yield of 0.8\r\nmillion q. a year), and Kiev, Volhynia, and Poltava each produce almost\r\nas much. In other regions of the Ukraine, buckwheat is raised much less\r\nfrequently (7% in Polissye, 2% in Galicia), in the southern part of the\r\nUkraine almost none at all. Millet is raised chiefly in the Government\r\nof Kiev (10% of the farm-land, 2.3 million q. annual production) and\r\nVoroniz (9%). In Kharkiv and Poltava the amount of land used for millet\r\nis only 4%, in Galicia 1%. In Kherson the cultivation of the\r\nChugara-millet has been begun. The chief region of Indian corn\r\ncultivation is Bessarabia, where this crop takes up 32% of the area of\r\ncultivation. Indian corn is also grown in the adjacent regions of\r\nPodolia (7%), Kherson (3%), Galicia (3%), and the Bukowina, playing an\r\nimportant part in feeding the population in these regions. The chief\r\nregions of corn production are Podolia (1.8 million q.), the Ukrainian\r\npart of Bessarabia and Kherson (each 1.1 million q.) and Southeastern\r\nGalicia (0.9 million q.).\r\n\r\nBesides grains and cereals, some other species of plants are of great\r\nimportance in the agricultural production of the Ukraine. The first of\r\nthese is the potato. The fact that the yield of the potato is six or\r\neight times that of the other plants makes it a very important staple.\r\nYet this advantage of the potato is but little exploited in the\r\nUkraine. Only in Galicia does the potato take up 14% of the farm-land\r\n(annual production in Eastern Galicia 38.7 million q.). Even in the\r\nPolissye region and in Chernihiv, only 6% of the farm-land consists of\r\npotato-fields, in Poltava and Kharkiv only 3%, in the Southern Ukraine\r\nbarely 1%. The total production of potatoes in the Russian Ukraine is\r\n63.2 million q. annually, therefore 22% of the production of European\r\nRussia. The large landowners use the potato for distilling alcohol\r\n(especially in Galicia), or for cattle-feed.\r\n\r\nVarious species of beans and lentils are raised everywhere in the\r\nUkraine, but on a small scale, chiefly in kitchen-gardens. In Galicia\r\nthese vegetables take up 3% of the farm-land, in Polissye and Chernihiv\r\n2% each, in the other districts of the Ukraine still less. The culture\r\nof forage (clover, lucerne, fodder-turnip) is still in its infancy in\r\nthe Ukraine. Only in Galicia do such plants take up more than 10% of\r\nthe farm-land.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of commercial plants stands upon a comparatively low\r\nlevel. Most extensive is the cultivation of hemp and flax; but it takes\r\nup only a tiny part of the general area of cultivation of the land.\r\nFlax is cultivated chiefly in the Polissye region and in Katerinoslav\r\n(3% of the farm-land). In Chernihiv, Poltava, Kharkiv, it takes up 1 to\r\n2% of the farm-land, in Galicia 1% (together with hemp). In the\r\nSouthern Ukraine a short-stemmed variety of flax, raised only for\r\nobtaining oil, is cultivated widely. Hemp takes up on the average 1% of\r\nthe farm-land, only in Chernihiv as much as 4%. All the hemp products\r\nare used in home industry, white the flax products are mostly exported.\r\nAnother plant grown for the sake of oil thruout the Ukraine, but\r\nespecially in the eastern borderlands of the country, is the sunflower.\r\nRapeseed is grown only by the large landowners, chiefly in Kherson,\r\nKiev, Poltava, and Podolia. Poppy is cultivated everywhere in the\r\nUkraine even by the peasants. Among the industrial plants of the\r\nUkraine the sugar-beet plays a very important part. In the year 1897\r\nRussia had 410,000 hectares of beet-fields, 330,000 hectares of this\r\narea being in the Ukraine. The total Russian production of sugar-beets\r\nwas 60 million metric hundredweights, of which 50 millions, that is,\r\nfive-sixths, came from the Ukraine. The most important centers of\r\nsugar-beet production lie in the Governments of Kiev, Kharkiv and\r\nPodolia, much less being produced in Volhynia, Chernihiv and Kursk. In\r\nthe Austrian Ukraine sugar-beet culture is developed only in\r\nSoutheastern Galicia and Northern Bukowina. Not only the large\r\nlandowners, but also frequently the peasants, engage in sugar-beet\r\nculture with great profit.\r\n\r\nAnother important commercial plant of the Ukraine is tobacco, which\r\ntakes up over 50,000 hectares of farm-land, 3000 hectares of it in\r\nGalicia. The chief districts of tobacco production are Chernihiv,\r\nPoltava, Kuban and Tauria. Much less is produced in the Black Sea\r\nregion in Podolia, Volhynia, Bessarabia, Kherson and Kharkiv. The\r\ntobacco production in Russian Ukraine in 1908 amounted to over 660,000\r\nq., that is, 69% of the total production of Russia, in Galicia 50,000\r\nq. Tobacco culture has a great future in the Ukraine, because the\r\nground and the climate are wonderfully fit for it. But first the\r\nunfavorable conditions, which lie chiefly in the poor organization of\r\nthe tobacco trade, must be removed.\r\n\r\nHops are raised in the Ukraine to a very slight extent. In Galicia only\r\nthe large landowners engage in a little hop culture on 2300 hectares of\r\nground. In Volhynia the Chekhic colonists have introduced the\r\ncultivation of hops. It comprises about 3000 hectares of land and\r\nyields over 16,000 q. of hops a year, that is 40% of the total Russian\r\noutput of hops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT AND VEGETABLE RAISING\r\n\r\nVegetable-culture is very slightly developed in the Ukraine. Beyond the\r\nlittle vegetable gardens about the houses and the melon-patches in the\r\nsteppe we see no developed vegetable culture even in the neighborhood\r\nof large cities. It is worthy of mention only in the Chernihiv and\r\nOdessa regions, as well as in the old Zaporog country on the Dnieper\r\n(Oleshki, etc.). Here vegetables are harvested twice a year, in the\r\nearly summer for exportation and in the fall for home use. The South\r\nUkrainian melon plantations (bashtani) annually yield great masses of\r\nsweet melons, watermelons, pumpkins and cucumbers. Here there has even\r\narisen a special class of bashtanki, who rent pieces of land for melon\r\npatches.\r\n\r\nFruit-culture is much more highly developed in the Ukraine. The love of\r\nthe Ukrainian people for trees favors the planting of orchards. The\r\nignorance of progressive fruit-culture, owing to illiteracy, as well as\r\nthe exploitation of the fruit growers by middlemen is hindering the\r\ndevelopment of Ukrainian fruit-culture, which, nevertheless, has a\r\ngreat future before it, and even now plays an important part in the\r\neconomic life of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe greatest amount of space is taken up by orchards in Bessarabia\r\n(40,000 hectares), where the more delicate kinds of apples, pears,\r\nplums and walnuts, almonds and apricots are raised. In Podolia the\r\norchards of the peasants alone comprise more than 26,000 hectares.\r\nBesides apples, pears and plums, great quantities of cherries are\r\nraised here. The orchards usually lie in the deep river-valleys. The\r\nyar of the Dniester, between Khotin and Yampol, produces annually half\r\na million metric hundredweights of fruit. From Podolia and Bessarabia\r\nover 800,000 q. of fresh fruit, 100,000 q. of dried fruit and 20,000 q.\r\nof nuts and almonds are exported annually. The most luxuriantly growing\r\norchards are those of Tauria, which cover over 7000 hectares on the\r\nnorthern declivities of the Yaila Mountains. The annual production\r\nexceeds 160,000 q. of fruit and 40,000 q. of nuts. In this region the\r\ntenderest species of apples, pears and plums flourish, besides apricots\r\n(4,000 q. a year) and peaches. About the middle of May the cherries\r\nripen here. In the middle of June the apricots; at the end of June\r\nplums and early pears; about the middle of July peaches and early\r\napples; in August we have autumn pears and apples, and in the first\r\nhalf of September, the winter apples.\r\n\r\nBeyond these districts, fruit-culture is practised on a large scale in\r\nthe Kiev region and in Volhynia. Here, above all, the hardier northern\r\nspecies of apples and pears are raised, as well as cherries. In Kherson\r\nand Katerinoslav, too, fruit-raising flourishes; especially in the\r\nDnieper valley, where apricots also thrive. In the Poltava country\r\nfruit-culture is still important enough, while in the districts of\r\nKharkiv, Voroniz, Kursk and Chernihiv it is much less significant,\r\naltho we find, even here, a few centers of intensive fruit-growing; for\r\ninstance, in the vicinity of the cities of Kharkiv, Okhtirka,\r\nBohodukhiv. In Galicia fruit-growing is not especially developed,\r\nexcept in Pokutia, the vicinity of Kossiv, and the Podolian\r\nyari-valleys, where (near Zalishchiki) even apricots and grapes are\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain connection between fruit-growing and viniculture.\r\nThe northern boundary of the grape in the Ukraine, coincides\r\napproximately with the May isotherm of +16° and reaches the 49th\r\nparallel. This boundary line may be drawn from Zalishchiki, past\r\nKamianez and Katerinoslav, to Astrakhan. In places, however, the\r\nnorthern boundary of the vineyards extends beyond the 50th parallel;\r\nfor example, near Bilhorod, in the Government of Kursk. Thus, the\r\nentire southern part of the Ukraine may be considered a favorable\r\nvine-growing region. But vine-culture has not developed in the entire\r\ngreat expanse of the Southern Ukraine; it is confined to only a few\r\ncenters. In Galicia the vine is cultivated only in Zalishchiki, in\r\nRussian-Podolia only in a few river-valleys. Somewhat greater is the\r\nwine-production of the old Zaporog district, where both inclines of the\r\nDnieper valley are planted with grape-vines. In the Kherson region the\r\nvineyards cover about 7000 hectares. The most important wine-producing\r\ndistrict of the Ukraine is Bessarabia, where the vineyards take up\r\n75,000 hectares, that is, a third of the entire Russian wine-country,\r\nand yield over 2½ million metric hundredweights of grapes annually.\r\nFrom this amount usually 870,000 hl. of wine are obtained, which,\r\ndespite its fine quality, is so cheap, as a result of the poor\r\norganization of the wine trade, that the barrel often costs more than\r\nits contents. Vine-growing is but slightly developed in the Don region,\r\nwhere 33,000 q. of grapes are obtained every year, and the familiar\r\nsparkling wines are manufactured. In the Government of Stavropol we\r\nfind large vineyards only in the Kuma and Terek valley. In Ciscaucasia,\r\nthe vineyards cover about 19,000 hectares, and nearly 200,000 hl. of\r\nwine (of very good quality) are obtained annually. Grapes flourish very\r\nluxuriantly in the Black Sea region and in Tauria. Many vineyards are\r\nfound in Melitopol and Berdiansk, but the most successfully flourishing\r\nvines are those of Crimea, where tender French and Spanish varieties\r\nare also cultivated. Wine-growing has become an important branch of\r\nindustry for the population here. Tauria yields only 250,000 hl. of\r\nwine annually, because of the exclusive use of raw grapes for medicinal\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nBee-culture has, since ancient times, been carried on in the Ukraine in\r\nvery close connection with fruit-growing. It is very popular thruout\r\nthe Ukraine, and in some districts of the country we rarely find a\r\npeasant farm without several beehives. Yet the almost fabulous wealth\r\nof honey which the Ukraine originally possessed is steadily declining.\r\nDeforestation has limited the original forest bee-culture to the\r\nPolissye only. The continued assimilation of meadows and steppes for\r\nagriculture has greatly injured the Ukrainian bee industry, and\r\nprogressive bee-culture is spreading very slowly among the Ukrainians,\r\ndue to the lack of education and instruction. The chief producing\r\ncenters of honey in the Ukraine are Kuban (326,000 bee-hives), Poltava\r\n(305,000 bee-hives), Chernihiv (283,000 bee-hives), Kharkiv (246,000\r\nbee-hives), Kiev (242,000 bee-hives), Volhynia and Podolia (each\r\n206,000 bee-hives). The total production of honey of the Russian\r\nUkraine, in 1910, amounted to 125,900 q., wax 13,700 q. (38% and 34%\r\nrespectively of the total production of the Russian Empire). In\r\nGalicia, in 1880, the number of bee-hives was still as high as 300,000,\r\nin 1900 only 210,000. Nevertheless, the land produced one-half of the\r\nhoney and one-eighth of the wax of the entire Austrian production\r\n(25,000 and 350 q. respectively). The damp, cool summers of the past\r\ndecades have greatly injured the Galician bee industry, but, in very\r\nrecent years, progressive bee-culture has begun to develop strongly\r\nhere, and to increase the honey and wax production of the land.\r\n\r\nSilkworm-culture is very slightly developed in the Ukraine, altho the\r\nmulberry trees thrive almost everywhere in the country, and\r\nsilkworm-culture requires no great outlay in money and labor. Attempts\r\nare being made in the Don region, Tauria, Bessarabia, Kherson,\r\nKaterinoslav, Kharkiv, Kiev, Poltava and Chernihiv, but the silk output\r\nis still very small. In the Government of Kiev, in 1907, barely 1,300\r\nq. of cocoons were obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE RAISING\r\n\r\nCattle-raising thruout the Ukraine is closely joined to agriculture.\r\nOnly in the Pontian steppes the remains of the originally extensive\r\ncattle industry are left today. With the prevailing shortage of land,\r\ncattle-raising is a source of industry of the greatest importance to\r\nthe Ukrainian peasantry, the most important source of ready money with\r\nwhich to pay taxes and to invest in farm improvements. Unfortunately,\r\nthe Ukrainian peasantry is only beginning to understand the importance\r\nof progressive cattle-raising and to introduce it. In Galicia, this\r\nmovement has already had a good start. In the Russian Ukraine, only the\r\nlarge landowners (and they but rarely) are carrying on progressive\r\nagriculture. On the other hand, it should be noted that only extensive\r\ncattle-raising pays the large landowner, hence, cattle-raising by the\r\npeasants is of incomparably higher importance in the life of every\r\ncultured nation. For this reason, cattle-raising in the Ukraine gives\r\npromise of a splendid future, once it is carried on by an enlightened\r\npeasant class.\r\n\r\nThe total number of cattle in the Ukraine can hardly be estimated, even\r\nroughly. At any rate it is considerably more than 30 million, of which\r\napproximately four million belong to the Austrian Ukraine. Compared to\r\nthe adjacent countries, the Ukraine is very rich in cattle. The Russian\r\nUkraine, which comprises not quite a sixth part of European Russia,\r\npossesses fully a third of the Russian stock of cattle; that is, about\r\ndouble the amount it should have according to the size of the\r\nterritory. In like manner, the Austrian Ukraine is important for its\r\nexports of cattle to Western Austria and Germany.\r\n\r\nOf all the districts of the Ukraine, the relatively smallest stock of\r\ncattle is found in Galicia, for here there are only 723 head of cattle\r\n(116 horses, 372 horned cattle, 60 sheep, 172 hogs) for each 1000\r\ninhabitants. The proportions are greater in the Russian Ukraine. For\r\nevery 100 of the population Volhynia has 19 horses, 32 steers, 18\r\nsheep, 17 hogs. The corresponding numbers for Podolia are 16, 19, 17,\r\n11; for Kiev 13, 18, 17, 10; for Kherson 29, 24, 16, 11; for Chernihiv\r\n21, 25, 33, 16; for Poltava 14, 22, 27, 11; for Kharkiv 17, 27, 23, 10;\r\nfor Katerinoslav 25, 26, 21, 12; for Tauria 30, 28, 61, 11; for Kuban\r\n34, 54, 80, 21.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin our survey of the cattle industry with a consideration\r\nof horse-raising. The Ukrainian breed of horses is widely distributed\r\nthruout the entire Dnieper region, its Chornomoric variety in the Kuban\r\nregion, its Don variety in the eastern border districts of the Ukraine.\r\nBy far the greater number of the Ukraine horses, however, are a mixed\r\nbreed, of small stature, and, despite great powers of endurance, not\r\nparticularly strong. Of the different breeds of small horses, only the\r\nHutzulian mountain-breed are important, because of their fine\r\nqualities. The remaining millions of small horses rather mark the low\r\ngrade of horse-breeding than real value for the population, which, in\r\nproportion to its economic resources, keeps entirely too many horses.\r\nVery little is being done to raise the standards of horse-raising in\r\nthe Ukraine. Breeding-studs are kept up by the large landowners only\r\nfor the breeding of race-horses, while nothing at all is done for the\r\nbreeding of work-horses. Only in Voroniz a breed of strong\r\ndraught-horses is produced (bitiuhi), and a little is accomplished also\r\nby the breeding-studs of Novo-Alexandrivsk (Kharkiv region) and in\r\nYaniv (in the Kholm country). In the Austrian Ukraine the\r\nwar-department takes care of the breeding of the Hutzulian breed of\r\nhorses with great success.\r\n\r\nHorned cattle are of much greater importance to the Ukrainian people\r\nthan horses, and the breed is relatively much better. Thanks to the\r\ngeneral distribution of the native gray breed, the addition of the red\r\nKalmuck breed of cattle in Eastern Ukraine, and the frequent crossing\r\nwith Western European breeds accomplished thru the agency of the large\r\nlandowners, the governments and the agricultural organizations,\r\ncattle-breeding in the Ukraine appears much more advanced than\r\nhorse-breeding. On the other hand, dairying in the Ukraine is barely in\r\nits beginnings. Only in Galicia has a dairymen’s organization been\r\nformed by the Ukrainian peasants, which produce ¼ million kilograms of\r\nbutter a year.\r\n\r\nSheep-raising in the Ukraine decreased considerably within the last\r\ndecades of the 19th Century, as a result of Australian competition.\r\nFormerly, the Southern Ukraine was one of the most important wool\r\nproducing regions of the world. The decline of the sheep-raising\r\nindustry has been accelerated a great deal by the transformation of the\r\nsteppes into farmland. The immense flocks of sheep which roamed the\r\nUkrainian steppes under the care of semi-nomadic shepherds are a thing\r\nof the past. Nevertheless, about 10 million sheep can still be found in\r\nthe Ukraine. The greatest part of them is raised in the Don region, the\r\nKuban region, Tauria, Katerinoslav and Bessarabia. Just as in the other\r\nbranches of live-stock-breeding, so also in the matter of\r\nsheep-raising, the most important part is performed by the peasant. The\r\npeasants breed chiefly coarse-wooled sheep of various breeds. These\r\nsheep can graze three-fourths of the year out in the steppes. The large\r\nlandowners raise far less sheep, but these belong to the fine-wooled\r\nMerino breed, the raising of which is more expensive, but also more\r\nprofitable. In very recent years the peasants have at last begun to\r\nengage in breeding the fine-wooled varieties. Sheep-raising is very\r\nimportant in the districts of Chernihiv, Poltava and Kharkiv, where, in\r\nthe year 1900, there were 3½ million sheep (3 million of which belonged\r\nto peasants). Here the greatly renowned Reshetilov breed of sheep is\r\nraised. The remaining districts of the Ukraine carry on very little\r\nsheep-raising. Only in the Carpathians is it an important branch of\r\nindustry of the population. Here the coarse-wooled mountain-sheep graze\r\nin the mountain pastures, and bring almost greater profit thru their\r\ndairy products and skins than thru their wool.\r\n\r\nGoats are found very rarely in the Ukraine, almost exclusively in the\r\nCarpathian, Yaila and Caucasus Mountains. Hog-raising, however, is\r\nperhaps the most important source of income of the poorer Ukrainian\r\npeasantry, and as such it is common everywhere in the Ukraine, most of\r\nall in Chernihiv, Volhynia and Kuban. Besides sty-breeding, extensive\r\nbreeding is carried on in some districts. On the lower Dnieper and\r\nDniester large droves of swine remain in the plavni all summer and\r\nfall. Improved breeds of English hogs (Yorkshire, Berkshire, etc.) are\r\nnot common in the Ukraine and easily degenerate, while the most common\r\nbreeds, the Russian, the Polish and the southern curly-haired variety,\r\nare very hard to fatten.\r\n\r\nCamels are kept only in the southeastern steppes of the Ukraine\r\n(Tauria, Don region, Stavropol), buffaloes only in Bessarabia, asses\r\nand mules in Bessarabia and Tauria.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the end of our survey of cattle-raising in the Ukraine,\r\nwe must turn to poultry-raising, which constitutes one of the most\r\nimportant sources of the money income of the peasantry. In view of the\r\ntruly Spartan mode of life of our peasants, very little poultry is\r\nconsumed by the breeder himself, most of it being sold to the dealers\r\nor in the cities. The balance of the production over the local\r\nconsumption is so great that the entire Ukraine has become an exporting\r\nregion for poultry, eggs and feathers to the other districts of Russia,\r\nto Western Austria, Germany, England, etc. From the nine governments of\r\nthe Ukraine, in 1905, over 600,000 q. of eggs were exported, 90% of\r\nwhich went over the border. These Ukrainian governments yielded 40% of\r\nthe total Russian exportation of eggs, Kharkiv alone giving 8%, Kiev\r\n5%. If we consider the remaining Ukrainian districts of Russia, we can\r\nsay, without fear of error, that all the Russian territory together\r\nthat is inhabited by Ukrainians produces more than half the Russian\r\noutput of eggs and poultry. Podolia alone, in 1908, sold nearly 3½\r\nmillion fowl, Kharkiv (1906) 1¼ million. Galicia, about the year 1903,\r\nexported annually eggs to the value of 35 million crowns [1], feathers\r\nto the value of 3 million, and poultry to the value of 1½ million, of\r\nwhich, at least, two-thirds must be credited to the Ukrainian part of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer in the Ukraine raises live-stock. The percentage of\r\nexclusive breeders of live-stock is very small; in the Russian Ukraine,\r\nin 1897, it was hardly 0.4%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nAltho farming—agriculture and cattle-raising—must, for the time being,\r\ncomprise the main source of industry of the population of the Ukraine,\r\nthis blessed land does not lack other resources as well. Very great\r\nmineral resources lie in various districts of the Ukraine; the largest\r\nin the Donetz Plateau, in the Carpathians, and in the Caucasus. There\r\nis little prospect, to be sure, that the Ukraine might, with the aid of\r\nits mineral resources, become an industrial country like Germany or\r\nEngland, yet there does exist some hope that it will soon be in a\r\nposition to provide its own needs in the way of industrial products.\r\n\r\nGold is found in the Ukraine only in traces, hardly worth mentioning,\r\nin the gold-containing quartz of the Naholni kriaz in the Donetz\r\nPlateau. Silver, together with lead, appears much more frequently,\r\nchiefly in the Kuban and Terek regions of the Caucasus, where, in 1910,\r\nabout 300,000 q. of lead and silver ore were mined (73% of the total\r\nRussian production), yielding 25.5 q. of silver (90%) and about 11,000\r\nq. of lead (81%), and also in the Donetz region and in the Ukrainian\r\nCarpathians of the Bukowina and Northern Hungary. The amount produced\r\noutside of the Caucasus, on the other hand, is very insignificant. Zinc\r\nis found only in small quantities in the Naholni kriaz. Tin, nickel,\r\nchromium and platinum are not found anywhere in the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe first in the series of the more important mining products of the\r\nUkraine is mercury. It is obtained from the cinnabar mines of\r\nMikitivka, in the Donetz Plateau. Here, 842,000 q. of cinnabar were\r\nmined in 1905, yielding 320,000 kilograms of mercury. Outside the\r\nUkraine, the Russian Empire has no mercury mines worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nCopper ore is found in the Donetz Plateau, in Kherson and Tauria, in\r\nthe Bukowina and Marmarosh, yet the production is comparatively small.\r\nMuch greater is the copper production of the Caucasus, where, in 1910,\r\nabout 2,500,000 q. of copper ore (35% of the Russian production) and\r\n81,000 q. of copper (31%) were gained.\r\n\r\nMuch more important is the manganese production of the Ukraine.\r\nManganese ores are gained chiefly from the oligocene strata of the\r\nNikopol region (on the lower Dnieper), and in Eastern Podolia. The\r\nproduction for the year 1907 amounted to 3,245,000 q., or 32% of the\r\ntotal Russian output and about one-sixth of the output of the world.\r\n\r\nBut all the remaining metal resources of the Ukraine disappear, as it\r\nwere, beside the enormous wealth of iron of the land. Iron ores are\r\nfound in great quantities in very many places in the Ukraine; many\r\ndeposits have not been sufficiently explored to make exploitation seem\r\nadvisable, and many, for various reasons, are not being exploited. The\r\niron production of the Ukraine is consequently limited to a few\r\ncenters, but in these it is of very great importance. The most\r\nimportant center of iron mining is Krivi Rih (Government of Kherson)\r\nand vicinity. The annual production here (1903–1904) amounted to 26¼\r\nmillion metric hundredweights. The entire supply of iron ore at Krivi\r\nRih is estimated at 870 million metric hundredweights, but in the\r\nimmediate vicinity there lie much larger untouched deposits. The iron\r\ncontent of the ores (red and brown iron ore) is 60–75%.\r\n\r\nOther iron ore deposits of the Ukraine are of much less significance.\r\nOnly in the Donetz Plateau and in the vicinity of Kerch are iron ores\r\nstill mined in considerable quantities. The iron ore deposits of the\r\nCaucasus, the brown iron ores and swamp-ores of Volhynia, of the\r\nwestern Kiev country and of the Polissye, are not exploited, and in in\r\nthe Ukrainian Carpathians of the Bukowina and Northeastern Hungary,\r\niron mining is dying out.\r\n\r\nThe iron production of the Russian Ukraine in 1907 amounted to 39.9\r\nmillion q., that is, 73% of the total Russian production. The figures\r\nfor the years following are: 1908—40.3 million q. = 74%; 1909—39\r\nmillion q. = 74%; 1910—43.4 million q. = 74%; 1911—51.1 million q. =\r\n72%. These figures show clearly enough what a wealth of iron the\r\nUkraine possesses, and what part the country plays as the chief\r\nproducer of iron for Russia.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the second group of mineral resources,—the mineral\r\nfuels. In this respect, too, the Ukraine is richly supplied. The\r\nUkraine possesses but one coal-field in the Donetz Plateau, but this\r\ncoal-field is one of the largest and richest in Europe. Its surface\r\narea is 23,000 square kilometers, the annual production (1911) 203\r\nmillion metric hundredweights, that is, 70% of the total production of\r\ncoal of the entire Russian Empire. Then, the coal-district on the\r\nDonetz is very rich in anthracite. In 1911, approximately 31 million\r\nmetric hundredweights of anthracite were gained here (98.5% of the\r\ntotal Russian production). For coke-making, practically the only coal\r\nthat can be used in Russia is the Donetz coal. In 1911, 33.7 million\r\nmetric hundredweights of coke was gained in the Donetz region; in all\r\nthe remaining coal districts of the Russian Empire, barely 13,600 q.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures we see clearly that the Ukraine, despite its general\r\nagrarian character, possesses great supplies of coal, that\r\nindispensable aid in modern industry. To be sure, the Ukraine takes\r\nonly seventh rank in the world’s coal production (being preceded by the\r\nUnited States, Great Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary, France and\r\nBelgium) yet it is, nevertheless, not to be despised as a producing\r\ndistrict. When we consider the backward state of material culture in\r\nRussia as a whole, the youth of the Ukrainian coal-mining industry, and\r\nthe centripetal railway tariff policy of the Russian Government, we\r\nmust come to realize that, with better conditions, a brilliant future\r\nawaits the Ukrainian coal industry.\r\n\r\nThe brown-coal deposits of the Ukraine are as yet but slightly\r\nexplored, and, in themselves, much less important than the pit-coal\r\ndeposits. A brown-coal field of 5000 square kilometers is part of the\r\ntertiary strata of the Dnieper Plateau (Kiev-Yelisavet coal region).\r\nToward the end of the past century an annual average of 82,000 q. of\r\nbrown-coal was mined here (Katerinopol, Zuraska). Just as unimportant\r\nis the brown-coal production in the Caucasian foothills\r\n(Batalpashinsk). In the Carpathian foothill country and in the Rostoch,\r\nin 1901, over 1 million metric hundredweights of brown-coal was mined;\r\nin 1905 barely one-half that amount. Notwithstanding, some importance\r\nmust be attached to the brown-coal industry in the Ukraine for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nLarge peat deposits are widely distributed in the Polissye, in\r\nVolhynia, Podlakhia, Galicia, Kiev, Podolia, etc., but extremely little\r\nis done in the way of rational exploitation. Only in the Polissye and\r\nin Galicia (40 places in 1905) is peat cut on a large scale, altho its\r\nimportance, especially for the districts of the Ukraine, which have few\r\nforests, should not be underestimated.\r\n\r\nIn petroleum and ozokerite the Ukraine is the richest land in Europe.\r\nAlong the great bend of the Carpathians, beginning at the Poprad Pass,\r\none petroleum district crowds close upon the next. They lie almost\r\nexclusively in the Ukrainian territory of Galicia, e.g., Borislav and\r\nTustanovichi, which, in 1907, yielded about 86% of the Galician\r\npetroleum output, in the Ukrainian District of Drohobich. The Galician\r\npetroleum production in 1911 amounted to 14.9 million metric\r\nhundredweights—(in 1907 even 17.5 million metric hundredweights), and\r\ntakes third rank in the world’s production (being outranked by Russian\r\nCaucasia and the United States). Considerable naphtha fields are also\r\nfound in the Ukrainian sub-Caucasian country, where, in 1910, near\r\nHrosni and Maikop, 12.6 million metric hundredweights of petroleum were\r\ngained. From the eastern tip of Crimea and the Taman peninsula to the\r\nCaspian Sea immense treasures of petroleum are hidden.\r\n\r\nThe only place in the world where ozokerite is found in large\r\nquantities is Eastern Galicia. In 1885 Borislav yielded 123,000 q. of\r\nthis rare mineral. The unexampled wastefulness in mining accounts for\r\nthe fact that, in 1911, Borislav together with other small\r\nsub-Carpathian mines (Dsviniach, Starunia, Truskavetz) yielded barely\r\n19,400 q. of ozokerite. Ozokerite is also found in the Ukrainian\r\nsub-Caucasus country, but in inconsiderable quantities.\r\n\r\nQuite as important as the iron, coal and petroleum deposits of the\r\nUkraine, are its salt deposits. The Ukraine has three districts of\r\nsalt-production—the Carpathian foothills, the Donetz Plateau, and the\r\nPontian-Caspian salt-lake and liman region. The sub-Carpathian\r\nsalt-mines and salt-works of Galicia (Latzke, Drohobich, Stebnik,\r\nBolekhiv, Dolina, Kalush, Delatin, Lanchin, Kossiv) all lie within\r\nUkrainian national territory, with the single exception of Vielichka\r\nand Bokhnia. In 1911 Galicia produced about 1,440,000 q. of rock salt,\r\nmost of which, to be sure, must be credited to Vielichka and Bokhnia.\r\nOn the other hand, the 1,690,000 q. of manufactured salt and brine were\r\nproduced mainly in the Ukrainian part of Galicia. In 1908 the salt\r\nproduction of the Ukrainian part of Galicia amounted to only 540,000 q.\r\nIn the Donetz region there are immense deposits of rock-salt in the\r\nvicinity of Bakhmut (e.g., Branzivka with a deposit of pure rock-salt\r\n100 meters deep). Here, in 1911, about 4.9 million metric\r\nhundredweights of rock-salt were mined (86% of the total Russian\r\nrock-salt production) and the rich salt-springs and salt-lakes\r\nexploited besides. In the Ponto-Caspian region first place is held by\r\nthe salt-lakes and limans of Crimea, then follow the limans of the\r\nKherson region (Knyalnik, etc.), the Manich lakes, etc. The amount\r\nproduced vacillates between 3⅓ and 5¾ million metric hundredweights a\r\nyear, and depends largely on the degree of dryness and heat of the\r\nsummer season. The total salt production of the Russian Ukraine in 1907\r\nattained 10 million metric hundredweights, or 53% of the production of\r\nthe entire Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nNitre salts are found in great quantities only in the Ukrainian\r\nsub-Carpathian country. In 1901 the amount produced was about 179,000\r\nq.; in the year of 1908 it decreased to 121,000 q.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-mentioned most important treasures of the soil,\r\nminerals less important, but yet noteworthy, are found in the Ukraine.\r\nIn Podolia and the adjoining border strips of Bessarabia there lie some\r\nrich deposits of phosphorites (70–75% phosphoric acid), out of which,\r\nin 1907, over 114,000 q. (72% of the total Russian production) were\r\nmined. In the districts of Katerinoslav, Kherson, Poltava, Chernihiv,\r\nKiev, Volhynia, in 1907, over 216,000 q. of kaolin were mined. Outside\r\nof the Ukraine no kaolin is found in Russia. Good pottery clays are\r\nfound thruout the Ukraine, mostly around Kiev, Chernihiv and Poltava.\r\nFireproof clays occur in the Donetz Plateau, slate in the Zaporoze\r\n(Katerinoslav), lithographic stone in Podolia (near Kamianez and\r\nMohiliv), graphite (in inconsiderable quantities, to be sure) in\r\nVolhynia, on the Sluch River, near Krivi Rih (Kherson), in the\r\ndistricts of Kiev and Katerinoslav, mineral paints near Lissichansk\r\n(Donetz region), Krivi Rih, and Yelisavet (Kherson), Stari Oskol\r\n(Kursk). Sulphur is obtained on the upper course of the Kuban River,\r\npumice stone in the Caucasus, rotten-stone near Svenihorodka (Kiev).\r\nMill-stones are obtained in many places, the best variety near Hlukhiv\r\n(Chernihiv), whetstones especially in the Poltava region and in the\r\nDevonian region of Galician-Podolia (Terebovla). Chalk is widely\r\ndistributed in Podolia, Volhynia and Kharkiv, gypsum in Podolia and\r\nPokutia (beautiful alabasters), as well as in the Donetz region.\r\nBuilding-stones, lime, sand, loam are found everywhere in the Ukraine\r\nand are of good quality. The most fit for masonry work are the devonian\r\nsandstone of Podolia, the granite gneisses of the Dnieper Plateau, and\r\nthe old eruptive formations of Volhynia.\r\n\r\nFrom this short survey of the mineral resources of the Ukraine, we\r\nperceive that the Ukraine, altho in this respect it does not compare\r\nwith the countries of Western and Central Europe, yet does produce a\r\ngreat deal, and after a thoro change in the political and cultural\r\nconditions, should be able to occupy an important place in the world’s\r\nproduction of mineral wealth. At present the Ukrainian people\r\ncontributes only the poorly-paid labor, while the profit falls to the\r\nforeign rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe industry of the Ukraine is now in an important stage of transition.\r\nThe originally very important home industries which, until recently,\r\nsatisfied all the needs of the peasantry, cannot endure the competition\r\nwith the factory system of large-scale industry, which is penetrating\r\nmore and more deeply into those regions of the Ukraine that lie\r\nfarthest from the highways of the world’s trade. Home industry is\r\ndeclining irresistibly, factory industry is developing more and more,\r\nand, altho the latter is still young and is retarded, in the textile\r\nbranches, by the centralization of industry at Moscow, still the\r\nUkraine (especially the southern part) is on the way to becoming the\r\nmost important industrial district of all Russia.\r\n\r\nUkrainian home industry is just as old and of as high a grade as all\r\nthe popular culture of the Ukrainians—this typical primitive\r\nagricultural people. The products of Ukrainian home industry are\r\ncharacterized above all by their great solidity and durability. Their\r\ndistinguishing feature is in the original ornamentation on all objects,\r\neven those destined for every-day use, noticeable particularly in the\r\nproducts of the textile, wood-carving and pottery industries. Anyone\r\nwho knows Ukrainian home industry is overcome by a sad feeling when he\r\nperceives that this industry, which may really be called a fine art,\r\nwill soon be a thing of the past. The foreign rulers of the Ukraine are\r\nhostile, or at best indifferent, to Ukrainian home industry, and all\r\nefforts of the Ukrainians to promote their very vital native home\r\nindustry are hindered at every turn. The middlemen ruthlessly exploit\r\nthe artisan, whose earnings are a mere pittance, insufficient even for\r\nthe contented Ukrainian. More and more of those who work at a trade are\r\nturning their backs upon their thankless occupations, if they can only\r\nfind a means of subsistence at something else.\r\n\r\nThe most important branch of Ukrainian home industry is weaving. It is\r\nnot confined only to the weaving of coarse, very durable kinds of linen\r\nand cloth; for very fine, sometimes really artistically ornamented\r\ntablecloths, towels and handkerchiefs, fine woolens, decorative fabrics\r\nwith inwoven patterns, gold and silver thread, carpets and tapestries,\r\ntoo, come out of the primitively equipped workshops of the Ukrainian\r\nweavers. Under very difficult working conditions, with the most\r\nprimitive means, genuine works of art are frequently created. For all\r\nthat, the artistic weaver must yield place to factory goods, even in\r\nthe Ukraine, and the home weaving industry is surely hurrying toward\r\nextinction.\r\n\r\nYet, to this day, thanks to the persistence of the people in preserving\r\ntheir national costume, the weaving industry is still so widespread\r\nthruout the Ukraine that there is hardly a hamlet where there are not\r\nsome weavers by trade, or at least such persons as carry on weaving as\r\nan avocation. Home weaving is at its height in the districts of\r\nPoltava, where it occupies 20,000 families (1902), Chernihiv and\r\nKharkiv. Its chief centers are Krolevetz and vicinity, Sinkiv,\r\nMirhorod, Zolotonosha (wool-weaving). In Galicia, the entire Ukrainian\r\nPidhirye is famous for its home weaving industry; in the mountains it\r\nis the neighborhood of Kossiv, in the low country the districts of\r\nHorodok, Komarno, Halich, Busk, etc., which are important in this\r\nconnection. The most beautiful carpets and tapestries, worked in\r\ncolors, come from the districts of Mirhorod and Sinkiv (Poltava),\r\nOlhopol, Balta, Yampol, Bratzlav (Podolia), Sbaraz, Buchach, Kossiv\r\n(Eastern Galicia).\r\n\r\nTailoring is nowhere developed to large proportions, altho no place,\r\nnot even the smallest village, is without it. In Poltava, tailoring and\r\ncap-making occupies over 10,000 families.\r\n\r\nRope-making is very common thruout the Ukraine, mostly in the districts\r\nof Poltava, Kiev (Lissianka) and in Galicia (Radimno). Nets are made in\r\nthe district of Lokhvitzia (Poltava) and Oster (Chernihiv) on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nAfter the textile industry comes the wood-working industry. It is\r\ncommon, everywhere in the Ukraine, the steppe country alone excepted.\r\nAlmost every Ukrainian peasant of the Carpathian Mountains, of the\r\nPolissye, Volhynia, Kiev, Chernihiv, knows the carpenter trade. The\r\nbest carpenters are the Hutzulians, who, independently, without drawn\r\nplans, build churches of fine style, even for the most distant villages\r\nof the low country.\r\n\r\nShip-building is carried on chiefly in the Polissye (Mosir, Petrikiv,\r\nBalazevichi on the Pripet, and particularly Davidhorodok on the Horin).\r\nOn the Dnieper River, ships are built at Horodnia, small sea-vessels in\r\nNikopol, Oleshki, Hola Pristan, Kherson; on the Don in Osiv (Azof). On\r\nthe Dniester, river-ships are built in Zuravno, Halich, Zvanetz,\r\nMohiliv, Yampol.\r\n\r\nCabinet-making, altho in general but slightly developed, still supplies\r\nthe demand of the peasantry and the common city-dwellers. Artistic\r\ncabinet-making is carried on in the Hutzul country (Kossiv, Yavoriv,\r\nRichka, Viznitza), where, besides furniture, various kinds of woodwork,\r\ndecorated with artistic carvings and with the beautifully\r\nconventionalized specifically Hutzulian bead and brass-wire ornaments\r\nare produced, e.g., canes, boxes, picture-frames, etc. The furniture\r\nindustry is common in the District of Cherkassia (Kiev) and in the\r\nentire Poltava country. Here, too, beautiful and durable wooden chests\r\nare made. Wooden spoons are produced in the districts of Poltava\r\n(Kalaidintzi), Kiev (Chornobil, Hornostapol), in the Hutzul country\r\n(Porohy, Yavoriv), in the Rostoche region (Yavoriv, Vishenka), and\r\nsmoking-pipes of wood in the Poltava region (Velika Pavlivka).\r\n\r\nCooperage and the making of wooden vessels is common everywhere, but it\r\nis most extensive in the districts of Poltava (3,700 families), Kharkiv\r\n(Okhtirka, Kotelva), Polissye (Mosir), Kiev (District of Radomishl),\r\nChernihiv, Volhynia and the Hutzul country.\r\n\r\nWagon-making and the making of sleds and wooden agricultural implements\r\nhas its chief center in the Poltava country, where it occupies over\r\n2400 families (Districts of Sinikiv, Lubni, Hadyach). In the Kharkiv\r\ncountry this industry is important about Starobilsk, Bohodukhiv, Isium,\r\nKupiansk, as well. In Ardon (Government of Chernihiv) beautiful\r\ncarriages are produced and in Tarashcha (Government of Kiev) the\r\nworld-renowned tarantas.\r\n\r\nThe shingle industry, charcoal-burning, pitch and potash-making are met\r\nwith only in the Carpathians and in the Polissye region. Yet, not so\r\nlong ago, these comprised one of the most important branches of\r\nindustry of the forest-dwellers. Basket-weaving is especially developed\r\nin the Poltava region (about 1000 families, chiefly in the Districts of\r\nLokhvitzia and Kupiansk), to some degree also in Podolia (Districts of\r\nLitin and Vinitza), Kherson, Kiev, Polissye about Mosir. Sieves are\r\nmade everywhere the wood industry is established. Bast shoes are made\r\nonly in the Polissye region.\r\n\r\nAmong the branches of industry in which mineral substances are used,\r\npottery takes first rank. Thanks to great deposits of splendid pottery\r\nclay, the Ukrainian pottery industry developed very early and now\r\nstands upon a very high plane. Its products usually have fine form and\r\nbeautiful ornamentation. Pottery is best developed in the Poltava\r\nregion, especially in the Districts of Mirhorod, Sinkiv (well-known\r\ncenter of Oposhnia), Romen and Lokhvitzia. In the Chernihiv country\r\npottery is almost as important, especially in the vicinity of Horodnia,\r\nKrolevetz, Hlukhiv (Poloshki and Novhorod Siversky). In the Kharkiv\r\nregion we find large pottery works in the regions of Valki, Lebedin,\r\nOkhtirka, Bohodukhiv, Isium; in the Kiev country about Chihirin, Uman,\r\nCherkassia, Svenihorodka, Kaniv, in Podolia about Mohiliv, Ushitza,\r\nYampol, and Letichiv. In Galicia the Rostoche region (Potilich,\r\nHlinsko, etc.), Podolia (Chortkiv, Borshchiv, Kopichintzi, etc.), and\r\nespecially the Hutzul country (Kolomia, Kossiv, Pistin, Kuti) are\r\nrenowned for pottery products. In other regions of the Ukraine pottery\r\nis less developed.\r\n\r\nThe brick-making industry is actively growing all over the Ukraine, and\r\nthe introduction of tile-covered brick buildings has led to the\r\nformation of numerous peasant organizations, for the purpose of making\r\nthese building-materials.\r\n\r\nThe stone-cutting industry is carried on on a large scale only in the\r\nregion of Odessa, Olexandrivsk (Kamishevakha) and Bakhmut.\r\n\r\nThe metal-working industry is, in general, not highly advanced. Only\r\nthe blacksmith trade is carried on everywhere and shows a fine\r\ndevelopment, especially in the Southern Ukraine. In the village\r\nsmithies in Kherson, Katerinoslav and Tauria, even complicated\r\nagricultural machines are often made. The production of iron ploughs\r\nhas for its centers the districts of Starobilsk (the village of\r\nBilovodsk produces on the average 3½ thousand ploughs a year), Isium\r\nand Valki of the Kharkiv country, in the Chernihiv country (districts\r\nof Starodub and Sosnitza), in the Poltava country (Zolotonosha and\r\nvicinity). Artistic brass-work is made by the Hutzuls of the Kossiv\r\nregion (Brusturi, Yavoriv, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe utilization of animal raw-materials plays an important part in the\r\nhome industry of the Ukraine. Sausage-makers are found in all the towns\r\nof the Ukraine, especially those of the left half, and their products\r\nenjoy a good reputation, even beyond the borders of the land. Tanning\r\nand fur-manufacturing flourish in the Ukraine. Ukrainian workmen have\r\nhad no small share in earning world-renown for the Russian leather\r\nindustry. The chief centers of this home industry lie in the districts\r\nof Chernihiv (in the regions of Chernihiv, Koseletz, Krolevetz),\r\nPoltava (about Sinkiv, Poltava, Reshetilivka with its famous furriery,\r\nPereyaslav, Kobeliaki), Kharkiv (about Okhtirka, Valki, Isium, Sumi).\r\nIn the Government of Voroniz, the village of Buturlinivka is noted for\r\nits leather industry. Shoemaking engages over 9000 families in Poltava\r\n(districts of Sinkiv, Kobeliaki, Romen, Konstantinohrad, etc.). In the\r\nregion of Kharkiv, the towns of Okhtirka and Kotelva are the main\r\ncenters of the shoemaking industry, in the Chernihiv country the\r\nregions of Novosibkiv, Borsna and Oster. In the region of Voroniz\r\n(districts of Bobrivsk, Biriuch, Valuiki) there are over 12,000\r\nshoemakers. In the Ukrainian part of Kursk the chief centers are the\r\ndistricts of Sudza (5000 shoemakers, 3000 of them in Miropilia alone)\r\nand Hraivoron. In Galicia we find a strongly developed shoemaking and\r\ntanning industry in Horodok, Kulikiv, Busk, Uhniv, Stari Sambir,\r\nRibotichi, Nadvirna, Buchach, Potik, etc.\r\n\r\nThe horn industry, especially the making of horn combs, appears in\r\nMirhorod and Sinkiv, in Kharkiv and about Sumi.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous other branches of home industry in the Ukraine the\r\norganized (guild) painters of sacred pictures, of whom there are over\r\n300 families in the Poltava region, may be mentioned in passing.\r\n\r\nSo much for home industry. The factory industry of the Ukraine is still\r\nin its infancy. Notwithstanding, it is already producing so much,\r\ndespite its youth, that Southern Ukraine, in particular, is on the way\r\nto becoming the most important industrial center of all Russia.\r\nLarge-scale production in the Ukraine is carried on almost exclusively\r\nby foreign (Russian, Jewish, English, French and Belgian)\r\ncapitalists—the Ukrainians contribute only the poorly-paid labor.\r\nUkrainian large-scale industry must wage a hard battle against the\r\neconomic policy of the Russian Government, which aims to stop the\r\ndeclining preponderance of the Moscow and St. Petersburg centers of\r\nindustry, and to prevent the industrial rise of the south.\r\n\r\nThe total value of the industrial output of the Russian Ukraine, in\r\n1908, was approximately 870 million rubles, or 19% of the total Russian\r\nlarge-scale production. The production of the Austrian Ukraine amounts\r\nto not even one-tenth of this amount. The main centers of large-scale\r\nproduction are Katerinoslav (166.2 million rubles), Kiev (143.5),\r\nKherson (127.5), and Kharkiv (98.7). Ukrainian large-scale industry\r\nconcerns itself chiefly with the manufacturing of the mineral products\r\nof the land and the preparation of foods. The textile industry is\r\nartificially suppressed in the interests of the Central Russian\r\nindustrial districts.\r\n\r\nThe cotton industry is confined to only a few small factories in the\r\nDon region (Rostiv, Nakhichevan) and Katerinoslav (Pavlokichkas). The\r\nwoolen industry is less limited (Chernihiv country, especially Klinzi,\r\nthen Kharkiv, Kiev, the Don region, Volhynia). The linen and hemp\r\nindustry is well developed only in the Chernihiv country (Pochep,\r\nMhlin, Starodub, Novosibkiv) and in Kherson (Odessa) jute factories are\r\nalso found. The clothing industry is worthy of mention only in Kherson\r\nand the larger cities of Eastern Galicia.\r\n\r\nOf the many branches of the food industry, the first to be mentioned is\r\nthe manufacture of sugar. The sugar refineries of the Ukraine, more\r\nthan 200 in number (most of them in the territories of Kiev, Kharkiv,\r\nPodolia, Kherson), produce annually (1904) over 6.6 million metric\r\nhundredweights of raw sugar and 3.9 metric hundredweights of refined\r\nsugar. These figures represent 76% and 68% respectively of the total\r\nRussian output. It is remarkable that in the Austrian Ukraine, where\r\nthe sugar industry has the finest possibilities of expanding, it is\r\nentirely undeveloped (only two factories). The milling industry, which,\r\nin general, is carried on chiefly in small water and wind-mills,\r\npossesses also some large mills operated by steam (Kharkiv, Kiev,\r\nPoltava, Kreminchuk, Odessa, Mikolaiv, Melitopol, Lviv, Brody,\r\nTernopil, Stanislaviv, Kolomia, etc.). Another important industry is\r\nalcohol-distillation, which is well advanced in all parts of the\r\nUkraine, but particularly in Russian and Galician Podolia (Galicia has\r\n800 stills), Kharkiv and Kiev. The beer-brewing industry is but\r\nslightly developed, and the only districts in which it yields a product\r\nof some quality are Galicia and the Bukowina. Mead brewing, also a\r\ncommon industry, is carried on on a large scale only in the Kharkiv\r\ncountry and in Eastern Galicia. Oil-pressing is important in the\r\nterritories of Kherson (Odessa), Kiev, Chernihiv (Pochep, Novosibkiv),\r\nin Kharkiv and in Kreminchuk. The important tobacco industry is carried\r\non to a considerable degree in 100 factories in the Russian Ukraine\r\n(Kiev, Kharkiv, Odessa, Zitomir, Poltava, Kreminchuk, Romen,\r\nKaterinoslav, Mikolaiv, etc.) as well as in three government factories\r\nin Galicia (Vinniki, Monastiriska and Zabolotiv).\r\n\r\nThe lumber industry embraces large saw-mills in the Carpathian mountain\r\ndistricts of Galicia, the Bukowina and Northeastern Hungary, as well as\r\nlong the Pripet and Dnieper Rivers (Mosir, Kreminchuk, Katerinoslav,\r\nKherson, etc.). The cork industry is established in Odessa, the paper\r\nindustry in Rostiv, Odessa, Kharkiv, Poltava.\r\n\r\nThe most important branch of Ukrainian large-scale industry is the\r\nmetal-industry. The Ukrainian iron industry, despite its youth, has\r\nrapidly surpassed the Polish, Moscow and Ural industry, and would be\r\neven more advanced if the economic policy of the Russian Government had\r\nnot taken measures for the protection of the Moscow and Ural industry\r\nfrom the industrial competition of the Ukraine. Hence, the Ukrainian\r\nmetal industry must furnish chiefly semi-manufactured goods, which are\r\nafterwards worked into finished goods in the center of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, there were obtained in the Ukraine, 24,625,000 q. of cast\r\niron, that is, 67.4% of the total Russian production; in 1912 the\r\npercentage is said to have reached 70%, while the rest, 30%, is\r\naccredited to Poland, Great-Russia and Russian-Asia. In 1911 the\r\nUkraine produced 18.8 metric hundredweights (55.6% of the total Russian\r\nproduction) of wrought iron and steel, and in the year 1912, it\r\nattained the same percentage. The significance of these figures is at\r\nonce apparent.\r\n\r\nThe iron works of the Ukraine lie chiefly near Krivi Rih, in\r\nKaterinoslav and vicinity, Olexandrivsk, the Donetz Plateau and the\r\nadjacent districts (Yusivka, Hrushivka, Tahanroh, Mariupol, Kerch,\r\netc.). The nail and wire industry has its center in Katerinoslav,\r\nmachine-manufacturing in Katerinoslav, Kiev, Kharkiv, Yelisavet,\r\nOdessa, Olexandrivsk, Mikolaiv and Berdiansk. The iron steamship\r\nbuilding industry has its seat in Rostiv and Mikolaiv. In Galicia we\r\nfind only a very small iron industry, and at best a few railway\r\nsupplies, factories and workshops are worthy of mention, e.g., those in\r\nSianik (car factory), New Sandetz and Lemberg.\r\n\r\nOf the other branches of industry which manufacture mineral products,\r\nthe petroleum refineries must be mentioned above all, particularly\r\nthose of the Carpathian foothill country (Horlitzi, Drohobich, Kolomia)\r\nand at the foot of the Caucasus (Hrosni). The factory industry of\r\npottery is carried on in Lviv and Kharkiv; porcelain and chinaware\r\nmanufacture in the Kharkiv region (Budi, Slaviansk) and in Odessa;\r\ncement manufacture in the Black Sea region, in Odessa and in the\r\nBukowina; brick and tile manufacture in all the large cities of the\r\nUkraine. Glass manufacture, once very extensive in the forest regions\r\nof the Western Ukraine (Rostoche, Volhynia), is now confined to the\r\nneighborhood of Kharkiv, Horodnia and Bakhmut. Of the different\r\nbranches of the chemical industry, the manufacture of matches is\r\nimportant; its seat is in the Chernihiv country near Novosibkiv, and in\r\nthe Galician sub-Carpathian country (Striy, Skole, Bolekhiv, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis does not exhaust the branches of industry of the Ukraine, but,\r\nbecause of their comparative insignificance, we must desist from\r\ndescribing them. Having now come to the end of our presentation of\r\nUkrainian industry, we have still to consider what percentage of\r\nUkrainians engage in industrial pursuits. According to official Russian\r\nestimates of the year 1897, the percentage is barely 5% (in Galicia,\r\naccording to Buzek’s biased calculation, 1.4%). The smallness of the\r\nfigures would surprise us if we did not know how the Russian and Polish\r\nnationality “make” their statistics; nevertheless, it cannot be denied\r\nthat the Ukrainian people still engage too little in industry. Among\r\nthe Ukrainians who seek their subsistence in industry, the greatest\r\nnumber (14%) engage in the making of clothing; then follow, in order,\r\nthe building, metal, lumber and food industries, linen-weaving and\r\npottery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADE AND COMMERCE\r\n\r\nThe mercantile movement in the Ukraine, as, in fact, in all of Eastern\r\nEurope, is comparatively slight. To give an exact picture of Ukrainian\r\ncommerce is much more difficult than to describe its agricultural and\r\nindustrial production. The great exchanges of goods in the interior,\r\nthe commercial relations of the Ukraine with the other districts of\r\nRussia and Austria-Hungary, its part in the export trade of these\r\nstates,—all this matter awaits working up on the part of competent\r\neconomists and geographers.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainian people take but little part in the commercial activity of\r\ntheir country; the Ukrainian peasant simply considers trade an\r\noccupation very little in accord with the rank of a landed proprietor,\r\nand the middle class has only begun in the last decades to recover from\r\nthe suppression of centuries. Hence, Ukrainian commerce lies almost\r\nwholly in the hands of the foreign races—the Russians, Jews, Armenians\r\nand Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe causes of this condition are usually sought and found by the\r\nforeign (Russian and Polish) “standard-bearers of culture” in the\r\nindifference and incapacity for culture of the Ukrainians. This\r\nexplanation, however, can be objected to when we recall the great\r\ncommercial importance of the ancient Kingdoms of Kiev and Halich, as\r\nwell as the long perseverance of the Ukrainian trade down into the 16th\r\nCentury, despite its systematic suppression by the Polish Government.\r\nNaturally, the five centuries of Tatar invasion caused severe injuries\r\nto Ukrainian trade. And when the commercial activity of the Ukraine of\r\nthe hetmans began to flourish in the 17th and 18th Centuries, it was\r\nsystematically suppressed by the Russian Government, following the\r\nill-fated rebellion of Mazeppa. Then we must consider the difficulties\r\nof competition with the Russians, a very talented commercial race, with\r\nthe Jews, the Armenians and the Greeks. Most keenly, however, the\r\ncalamitous lack of education is being felt. Wherever the education of\r\nthe people is more advanced, as, for example, in Eastern Galicia, there\r\nis a revival of the commercial spirit in the Ukrainians. The Galician\r\nUkrainians have thousands of shops, large commercial co-operative\r\norganizations (Narodna Torhovla, with seventeen branch warehouses and\r\nseveral hundred shops, Soyuz tohorvelnick spilok, Soyuz zbutu khudobi,\r\netc.), with the large annual turnover (large for Galician conditions)\r\nof 25 million crowns. The enlightened peasantry of Sinevidsko and\r\nvicinity (Boiko country) carries on an active fruit-trade far beyond\r\nthe Austrian borders. Even in the Russian Ukraine trade is coming to\r\nlife in all places. The co-operative movement has taken such a bound in\r\nadvance, in spite of the frightful illiteracy, that in 1912 there were\r\nover 2500 such organizations, while all of Russia (including the\r\nUkraine) had 5260, and Poland only 920. From these facts we may safely\r\nconclude that, with the elevation of the grade of culture, the former\r\ncommercial spirit of the Ukraine is reawakening. To be sure, the\r\nsturdy, upright nature of the Ukrainian, which abhors every form of\r\ndishonesty, will not lend to this new commercial spirit a\r\nworld-conquering character, but it will, on the other hand, increase\r\nthe influence of the Ukrainian merchant in the commercial world.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of commerce in the Ukraine is still very\r\nprimitive; first, because of the generally low grade of culture;\r\nsecond, because of the very primitive traffic conditions of Eastern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe first mark of the primitive condition is probably the existence of\r\ncountless annual fairs in the Ukraine—a relic of medieval trade\r\nconditions. The number of annual fairs in the Russian Ukraine exceeds\r\n4000, altho it is far out of proportion to the great number of annual\r\nfairs in Great Russia. But out of twenty-two grand annual fairs of\r\nRussia, eleven fall to the Ukrainian territory—four in Kharkiv, two in\r\nRomny, one in Poltava, Kursk, Kolevez, Yelisavet and Sumy,\r\nrespectively. In addition, there are the once famous Kiev “kontrakti”\r\n(now declining), and the smaller annual fairs in Berdichiv, Zitomir,\r\nDubno, etc. The greatest exchanges of goods take place in the Yordan\r\nfair in Kharkiv (January 20th), and the Elias fair (August 2nd) in\r\nPoltava. Here the wholesale dealers sell their goods to the retailers\r\n(Ofenyi—Russians from the Governments of Vladimir and Slobozani—Russian\r\nsectarians, colonists from the Chernihiv country, Jewish retailers who\r\nsell in the right half of the Ukraine), who buy or supplement their\r\nstock of goods during the annual fairs. In these wholesale\r\ntransactions, the so-called prassoli—Russian barterers—also engage,\r\ndealers who travel all year thru the villages of the Ukraine, exchange\r\nthe wool, bristles and flax of the peasants for hardware, and sell the\r\ncollected raw materials to the wholesalers. In this annual fair system,\r\nthe Ukrainians have, until recently, played an important part as paid\r\ndrivers, who drove the goods on their oxcarts from fair to fair. These\r\ndrivers at one time formed a sort of class of their own—the\r\n“chumaki”—and even engaged independently in the trading of the Crimean\r\nsalt and the dried fish of the Sea of Azof. The railroads have put an\r\nend to the former importance of the chumaki, yet the scanty length of\r\nthe Ukrainian railway system prevents this carting industry from\r\ndisappearing altogether. In the eighties of the past century there were\r\ncounted in the districts of Poltava, Kharkiv and Chernihiv, 210,000\r\nchumaks; in the year 1897, in Kherson, Katerinoslav, Tauria and Don,\r\nabout 100,000 of these hired drivers.\r\n\r\nThe fair system of Ukrainian trade is carried on not only by means of\r\ngreat annual fairs, which, by the way, are decreasing in importance\r\nyear by year, but also by means of an enormous number of smaller annual\r\nfairs in the cities, towns, and even villages of the Russian Ukraine,\r\nwhich take care of the retail trade. In the Austrian Ukraine the annual\r\nfairs (as for instance, the once famous fairs of Tarnopol, Ulashkivtzi,\r\nCzernowitz) have lost all significance since the modernization of the\r\ncountry’s commerce.\r\n\r\nWorld-commerce has, until very recently, left the Ukraine almost\r\nuntouched. This is one of the reasons why the primitive forms of\r\ncommerce were able to last so long in the Ukraine. Until recently,\r\nworld-commerce has taken the Ukraine merely for a producing and\r\nexporting country of raw materials, and left the supplying of local\r\ndemands to the traditional forms of trade. Only within the last decades\r\nhas the modern commercial organization begun slowly to take in the\r\nUkraine. The exchanges in Kiev, Kharkiv, Odessa, Kreminchuk, Mikolaiv,\r\nTahanroh, Rostiv, the chambers of commerce in Lviv and Brodi, are\r\norganizing the export of raw materials from the Ukraine, and the\r\nflooding of the country with the products of foreign industry is\r\nbecoming more and more intensive.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all we have mentioned, the significance of the Ukraine in\r\nthe internal commerce of Russia and in world-trade is very great. The\r\nnatural resources of the country, its situation on the threshold of\r\nAsia and the Mediterranean world, its property of being a direct\r\nhinterland of the Black Sea, give to the Ukraine a commercial\r\nimportance with which that of any other individual district of European\r\nRussia, the Baltic lands and Poland not excepted, can never compare.\r\n\r\nIn the internal commerce of Russia, the Ukraine figures, first of all,\r\nas purveyor of foodstuffs, and in Austria-Hungary the Austrian Ukraine\r\nplays the same part on a small scale. To represent these relations in\r\nfigures encounters great difficulties, and the figures can be only\r\napproximate. In 1895 the Ukraine exported over 1.5 million metric\r\nhundredweights of grain to Lithuania and White Russia, about 1.7\r\nmillion metric hundredweights to Poland, and about 0.9 million metric\r\nhundredweights to Central Russia. In 1905, two Ukrainian districts\r\nalone, Poltava and Kharkiv, exported over 0.7 metric hundredweights of\r\ngrain to Central Russia. These figures must be much greater today. And\r\nthe grain exportation of the Austrian Ukraine to the interior of\r\nAustria must be relatively as great. As a matter of fact, Galicia\r\nproduces one-third of the total Austrian output of oats and wheat, and\r\nalmost half the output of potatoes.\r\n\r\nQuite as important is the Ukraine’s exportation of live-stock. In the\r\nyears 1902–1904, the Ukraine exported 80,000 head of cattle to Central\r\nRussia, and the part played by Galicia as purveyor of live-stock for\r\nslaughter is well-known. Equally important is the exportation of small\r\ncattle, poultry, eggs and butter. The exportation of wool from the\r\nSouthern Ukraine plays an important part in the internal commerce of\r\nRussia. The Polissye, Carpathian and Caucasus regions furnish great\r\nquantities of lumber for exportation. The mineral products of the\r\nUkraine are used for the greater part outside the country—Caucasian and\r\nCarpathian petroleum, the iron ore of Krivi Rih, the salt, the\r\nmanganese, the coal of the Donetz Plateau. Of the entire yield of coal\r\nof the Donetz basin in 1905, barely one-third was used up in the\r\nfactories of this region; the other two-thirds were to serve the\r\nadvancement of Central Russian industry. All these products are the\r\nobject of an active export trade.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the exports, the imports of the Ukraine cannot be\r\nvery large. The imports embrace, almost exclusively, products of\r\nforeign manufacturing. In view of the general poverty and the very\r\nlimited wants of the Ukrainian peasantry, these imports must be small,\r\nsince home industry still covers the greatest part of the demand.\r\n\r\nThe part of the Ukraine in the external commerce of the Russian State\r\nis very important, while the Austrian Ukraine plays a very subordinate\r\npart in this respect. The ten central regions of the Ukraine furnish\r\nover 60% of the total grain export of Russia. In the customs districts\r\nof the Ukrainian part of the western border of Russia, 28.6 million\r\nrubles’ worth of goods was exported, 14.3 million rubles imported. The\r\ncustoms districts of the Pontian and Azof coast within the borders of\r\nthe Ukraine passed 245 million rubles in exports, 64.8 million rubles\r\nin imports. Over the borders of Russian Ukraine passed 33% of the\r\nRussian exportation and only 11% of the importation. This shows us how\r\nmuch the Ukraine contributes to the balance of trade in favor of\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraffic in the Ukraine is very slightly developed. Altho the natural\r\nconditions for traffic are very favorable, the historical fortunes of\r\nthe country took such a course that we cannot wonder at the present\r\nstate of intercourse. The Ukraine was for a long time under the\r\ndomination of Poland, which never cared for the condition of the roads;\r\nthen the country fell under the rule of Russia, which to this day\r\nstands upon a very low level as far as traffic conditions are\r\nconcerned. The Austrian Ukraine has the greatest number and the best\r\nroads, but they are found especially in Bukowina and Northern Hungary.\r\nFor in Galicia, where most of the roads are under the management of the\r\nautonomous Polish authorities, the condition of the roads is sad\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of Ukrainian highways are unpaved. All that\r\nthe Russian geographer, Krassnov, has said in general about the\r\nhighways of Russia, applies in its fullest extent to the unpaved,\r\nunmacadamized roads of the Ukraine. These roads are among the worst in\r\nthe world. In the summer they are enveloped in clouds of dust; in the\r\nspring and fall, as well as in rainy weather, they are strips of\r\nbottomless mud, in which even the light farm-wagon sinks to its axles.\r\nWherever it is at all possible, vehicles drive across the fields along\r\nthe roadway. Worst of all are the ways in the vicinity of and within\r\nvillages and small towns. Drains and bridges are either unknown, or\r\nelse there are not enough of them. The kind of roads just described are\r\nknown in the entire right half of the Ukraine by the traditional name\r\nof “Polish roads.” Still worse are the cane and corduroy roads of the\r\nPolissye; riding over these a long time becomes a positive torture to\r\nthe traveler. In the Hutzul country most of the roads are ordinary\r\nbridle-paths (plai), accessible only to foot passengers and\r\nbridle-horses.\r\n\r\nIn Galicia, only villages and hamlets are connected by unpaved roads;\r\nin the Russian Ukraine even large cities. Not a single macadamized road\r\nleads to cities like Poltava, Kreminchuk, Katerinoslav, Rostiv,\r\nKherson. That such negligence of the government should cause the\r\nUkrainian peasantry incalculable damage, and actually hinder trade and\r\ncommerce, is obvious at once.\r\n\r\nMacadamized roads are very scarce in the Ukraine as a whole. The\r\nAustro-Hungarian part of the Ukraine, altho in this respect it is far\r\nbehind the cultural countries of Europe, possesses a greater absolute\r\nnumber of macadamized roads than the Russian Ukraine, which is ten\r\ntimes as large in area. All cities and towns of the Austrian Ukraine\r\nare connected by macadamized roads. Eight such roads meet at Lemberg,\r\nseven in Czernowitz, six each in Peremishl, Ternopil, Kolomia, Buchach,\r\nHorodenka, etc. In the Russian Ukraine, on the other hand, the only\r\nmacadamized roads that deserve the name, are the road from Homel to\r\nKiev, the road from Kiev to Berestia (by way of Zitomir,\r\nNovhorod-Volinsky, Rivne, with branches to Dubno and to Kremianetz,\r\nLutzk, Kovil), the road from Tomashiv to Lublin, the road from\r\nStarokonstantiniv to Kamenetz, the road from Kursk to Kharkiv, and the\r\nmountain-road in the Yaila Mountains in Crimea. The remaining “great\r\ntracts” and “post-roads” (altho they sometimes figure as macadamized\r\nroads) are in such a miserable condition, that even in the large cities\r\nthey look more like moraines than streets in a civilized city.\r\n\r\nQuite analogous conditions prevail, also, in the railroad traffic of\r\nthe Ukraine. In this respect, too, the Austrian Ukraine surpasses the\r\nRussian Ukraine by far, despite the backward condition of the former.\r\nGalicia, for instance, has 5 kilometers of railroad for 100 square\r\nkilometers of surface, the Russian Ukraine barely 1 kilometer. Besides\r\nthe loose mesh of the railway-net of the Ukraine, there is the\r\nadditional disadvantage that its lines tend toward foreign centers, and\r\nconsider the local needs of Ukrainian traffic only in rare cases.\r\nGalicia, separated from the rest of Austria-Hungary by the natural\r\nboundary of the Carpathians, has had to develop an independent system\r\nof railways, with the main junction at Lemberg. In the Russian Ukraine\r\nall the main lines were built only for the convenience of the Moscow\r\ncenter and the Baltic ports. Hence, there is no direct railway line\r\nbetween Kiev and Odessa, for instance, or to Kharkiv, while there exist\r\nalmost straight line connections between Romen and Libau, between\r\nSevastopol and Kharkiv and Moscow. Besides that, strategic factors were\r\nthe deciding ones in the building of the railroads (particularly in\r\nWestern Ukraine), and the economic life of the country often has had to\r\nsuffer for it.\r\n\r\nA third disadvantageous aspect of the Russian Ukrainian railway system\r\nis its tariff regulations, the purpose of which is to concentrate the\r\ngreatest possible amount of traffic on the railroads of Central Russia\r\nand the Baltic provinces, and thus redound to their advantage. As a\r\nresult of this tariff policy of the Russian Government, it happens that\r\nit is sometimes cheaper to transport goods from the Ukraine to the most\r\ndistant Baltic ports, than to the adjacent ports of the Black Sea.\r\nThus, the tariff rates for grain from Romen to Libau (1077 versts) are\r\n21 kopeks per pud, from Romen to Mikolaiv (429 kilometers) 18 kopeks.\r\nIt costs more money and trouble to transport coal from the Donetz\r\nregion to the Black Sea ports than to the ports of the Baltic, which,\r\nof course, are far more distant. Naturally Pontian navigation suffers\r\nabove all from this cause, but all Ukrainian trade in general suffers\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the loose web of the net of railroads, and the\r\ndestination of all the railroad lines in the Ukraine to foreign\r\ncenters, there are almost no important railway centers in the Ukraine.\r\nThe only center of European proportions is Lemberg, where nine main and\r\nlocal lines meet. Striy, Stanislaviv, Kolomia and Ternopil are smaller\r\njunctions, with five converging lines. In the Russian Ukraine, only\r\nBerestia and Kharkiv deserve the name of railway junction, in the\r\nstrict sense of being a point of intersection of at least two main\r\nlines; the same is true of Poltava and Rostiv. The dependence of the\r\nUkrainian railway lines upon foreign centers is the cause of the fact\r\nthat frequently very important crossings lie beyond large towns, near\r\nto some miserable little village, as for example, Sarni, Bakhmach,\r\nKosiatin, Zmerinka, etc. The only concentrated district of the\r\nUkrainian railroad system with numerous local junctions, lies in the\r\nDonetz Plateau.\r\n\r\nWe shall now enumerate several railroads of the Ukraine which are most\r\nimportant for the traffic of the country. The Ukraine is connected with\r\nthe Black Sea by means of seven main lines: Lemberg-Odessa,\r\nZnamenka-Mikolaiv, Kharkiv-Sevastopol (with a branch to Kerch),\r\nKaterinoslav-Berdiansk, Donetz Plateau-Mariupol, Donetz\r\nPlateau-Tahanroh, Katerinodar-Novorossysk. Direct railroad connections\r\nwith Roumania exist via Tiraspol to Yassy, and from Lemberg by way of\r\nCzernowitz to Bukarest. The following lines lead into Hungary:\r\nStanislaviv-Sihot, Lemberg-Mukachiv, Lemberg-Uzhorod-Peremishl-Uihely.\r\nThe connection with Austrian-Poland (Western Galicia) is formed by the\r\nLemberg-Cracow and Stanislaviv-New-Sandetz lines, the connection with\r\nRussian-Poland by the lines of Kovel-Lublin-Warsaw and\r\nBerestia-Sidletz-Warsaw. The lines of Berestye-Bilostok, Rivne-Vilna,\r\nand Romen-Minsk-Libau lead north to White Russia, Lithuania and the\r\nBaltic. The Ukraine is connected with the north and northeast (Great\r\nRussia) by the lines of Kiev-Kursk, Kharkiv-Moscow,\r\nKupiansk-Penza-Samara, and Donetz Plateau-Voroniz. Eastward, the\r\nrailroad lines run from the Donetz region and Katerinodar to the bend\r\nof the Volga, and from Rostiv along the Caucasus to Baku.\r\n\r\nIn the Ukraine itself, the main lines of the railroads should run in a\r\ndirection west and northwest to east and southeast. Hence, the main\r\npaths of traffic should be the following lines: Czernowitz-Odessa,\r\nBerestye-Rivne-Berdichiv-Uman, Kovel-Kiev-Poltava-Donetz region-Rostiv,\r\nFastiv-Katerinoslav, Novosibkiv-Sumi-Kharkiv-Donetz Plateau, etc. As a\r\nresult of the railroad policy of the Russian Government, the north and\r\nsouth lines, which lead directly or indirectly to the Muscovite\r\ncenters, are held to be more important, as for instance, the following:\r\nBerestye-Minsk-Moscow, Lemberg-Rivne-Vilna, Novoselitza-Kiev-Kursk,\r\nVapniarka-Cherkassi-Piriatin, Mikolaiv-Kreminchuk-Romni,\r\nBalta-Kreminchuk-Kharkiv-Kursk, etc. Of greatest importance are, also,\r\nthe industrial railroads which connect the iron mines of Krivi Rih with\r\nthe coal-fields of the Donetz region, via Katerinoslav.\r\n\r\nThe waterways of the Ukraine were at one time the main roads of trade\r\nand commerce. The great cultural mission of the Ukrainian waterways is\r\nfamiliar from history; thru the course of long centuries they were the\r\nonly convenient thorofares thru the difficult forest regions and the\r\npathless steppes of the Ukraine. Traffic on the Ukrainian waterways\r\nwas, in former times, much more important than at present, not only\r\nbecause of the lack of other convenient pathways, but also because of\r\ntheir former greater length and capacity. Deforestation has decreased\r\nthe normal level of the rivers; mill-dams have cut off the once\r\nnavigable stretches of water.\r\n\r\nThe Ukraine possesses almost no artificial waterways. The only ones in\r\nexistence—the Orginski Canal (Yassiolda-Vihonivske ozero-Shchara, 54\r\nkilometers of canal, 124 kilometers of connected watercourses) and the\r\nDnieper-Buh Canal (Pina-Mokhavez, 81 kilometers of canal, 134\r\nkilometers of connected watercourses)—were built back in the days of\r\nPolish rule. They are antiquated, shallow and neglected, so they can\r\nserve only occasionally, and then only for log-floating.\r\n\r\nThe total length of Ukrainian waterways exceeds 7000 kilometers, which\r\nis just as much as the length of the waterways of Austria or of\r\nEngland, but only one-tenth that of European Russia. In this figure,\r\nsections of rivers are included which are navigable only for smaller\r\nriver vessels.\r\n\r\nThe statement of the navigability of individual rivers of the Ukraine\r\nis contained in the section which deals with the rivers of the Ukraine\r\n(v. p. 70 ff.).\r\n\r\nThe most important waterway of the Ukraine is the Dnieper system. The\r\nmain river is navigable in its entire Ukrainian section by the largest\r\nriver vessels. In the entire Russian river system the Dnieper system\r\nconstitutes 11% of the length, 10% of the total navigable length, 16%\r\nof the length navigable by steamship-lines. The rapids section,\r\nhowever, as a result of the incomprehensible negligence of the Russian\r\nGovernment, is, to this day, accessible only to the smaller ships and\r\nrafts, and then only for sailing downstream. The canals built by the\r\nGovernment in the Porohi (1843–1856) are so badly placed that\r\nnavigation, to this day, must still keep largely to the natural ancient\r\n“Cossack paths.” In the years 1893–1895, investigating engineering\r\ncommissions determined that it was possible, without great cost, to\r\nmake the Porohi section completely navigable. But the thing never went\r\nany further than that. At the beginning of the 20th Century, English\r\nengineers worked out a plan for the complete regulation of the Pohori\r\nsection and the construction of a waterway, accessible even to\r\nsea-going ships, which should connect the Baltic with the Black Sea by\r\nmeans of the Dvina and the Dnieper. The realization of this plan, which\r\nwould be of the very greatest importance to the Ukraine, is still\r\ndistant, and there is no hope that the Russian Government will attack\r\nit very soon.\r\n\r\nThus, the rapids hinder Dnieper navigation to this day, and not least\r\nfor the reason that the insurance companies will not insure vessels for\r\nthe rapids section. For this reason, the river fleet of the Dnieper is\r\nseparated into two parts. Above the rapids (in 1900) 208 steamboats and\r\n1002 other ships, below the rapids (together with the inlets of the\r\nBoh) 148 steamboats and 1203 other ships were plying. The number of\r\nsteamboats increased threefold above the rapids and doubled below the\r\nrapids during the last sixteen years of the last century. The total\r\nhorse power in 1900 was over 16,000. In 1906 the number of steamers of\r\nthe Dnieper region was 382, the number of other ships 2218.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper ships, propelled by sails and oars, which carry lumber,\r\ngrain, fruit and other goods, are of various types. The largest are\r\ncalled “honchaki,” and have a tonnage of up to 1400; then come the\r\n“barzi” and “barki” (900–1300 tons), “berlini” (800–1140 tons), which\r\nare the most useful, “baidaki” (650 tons), “trembaki,” “laibi,” “dubi”\r\n(130–160 tons), “lodki” (80 tons), “galari” (50 tons), and “chaiki” (30\r\ntons). The tonnage of the river fleet of the Dnieper (not counting\r\nsteamers), in 1900, was approximately 500,000 tons, hence not much less\r\nthan the tonnage of the present Austro-Hungarian merchant-marine.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the Dnieper and its tributaries are navigated by a great\r\nnumber of rafts. In 1910 the number of them was 15,676.\r\n\r\nOf the river harbors of the Dnieper system, Kherson carries on the\r\ngreatest exchange of goods (10 million q. in 1910). Then follow Kiev\r\n(5.3 million q.), Katerinoslav (3.1 million q.), Cherkassi (2.1 million\r\nq.), Niznodniprovsk (1 million q.), Chernihiv (0.6 million q.), and\r\nPinsk (0.5 million q.).\r\n\r\nNavigation on the Don, as a result of the small volume of water, is\r\nmuch slighter than the Dnieper navigation, despite the absence of\r\nrapids. In 1900, the number of steamboats on the Don was 189, with\r\n10,000 horse-power (in 1906 it was 382); the number of other ships 488,\r\nwith 200,000 tonnage (in 1906 only 471 ships). The main river-harbor is\r\nRostiv, which handles goods to the amount of 7.5 million q. annually.\r\n\r\nA good deal smaller still is the navigation of the Dniester. Here, in\r\n1900, there were only 9 steamers, with 200 horse-power (16 steamers in\r\n1906), and 187 ships of other kinds with a tonnage of 22,000 tons (277\r\nof them in 1906). The harbors of the main stream are Benderi (handles\r\n0.7 million q. of goods) and Maiaki (0.5 million q.). On the Kuban\r\nRiver 69 steamers (counting in those of the Kura) and 131 other ships\r\nplied in 1906.\r\n\r\nIn general, river navigation in the Ukraine is on a very moderate\r\nscale. The negligence of the Russian Government and the low grade of\r\nculture limit the development of Ukrainian interior navigation. Thru\r\nthe regulation of the Dnieper rapids and the connection of the river\r\nsystems of the Dnieper and Dniester with the Baltic waters, by means of\r\npracticable canals, the waterways of the Ukraine could attain a\r\nwonderful importance.\r\n\r\nHaving come to the end of our description of Ukrainian traffic, we must\r\nstill devote some attention to Ukrainian sea-navigation. Its present\r\ncondition is as lamentable as the general condition of Ukrainian\r\ntraffic. Of course, there is no doubt that the Black Sea has many\r\nqualities unfavorable to the development of navigation—its seclusion,\r\nthe lack of good harbors, and an abundance of dangerous storms. Yet,\r\nwhat are these disadvantages against modern engineering? To assign all\r\nthe blame to the low grade of Russian industry, as the Russian\r\npublicists are in the habit of doing, will not do. The causes of the\r\nslight development of Pontian navigation should be sought in the low\r\ncultural conditions of the ruling Russian nation and in the indolence\r\nof the government, which is not properly encouraging this navigation.\r\nThe Russian steamers do not enjoy a good reputation on the Black Sea.\r\nPontian coastwise navigation, which at the beginning of the 19th\r\nCentury had a splendid start, and was carried on predominantly by\r\nUkrainians, has not been able to develop properly under the heavy fist\r\nof the government. Today, conditions on the Black Sea are such, that\r\nthe transportation of a unit by weight of goods from one Pontian harbor\r\nto another, costs just as much as the transportation of the same unit\r\nfrom the same port to England.\r\n\r\nThe number of steamers which sail the Black Sea under the Russian flag\r\nwas, in 1901, only 316, with a tonnage of 187,000 tons, that is, 42% of\r\nthe number and 52% of the tonnage of the entire steamship fleet of\r\nRussia. In 1912 the figures were 410 steamers, 223,000 tons, the\r\npercentages being 42% and 47%. The number of sailing vessels in 1901\r\nwas 635, with a total tonnage of 47,000, and in the year 1912 there\r\nwere 827 sailing vessels, with over 53,000 tons. The development of\r\nPontian navigation is thus going a very slow, if not a retrogressive\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Black Sea steamers maintain a more or less regular service\r\nbetween the most important Black Sea ports—Odessa, Mikolaiv, Kherson,\r\nSevastopol, Rostiv, Novorossysk, etc. From Sevastopol a line goes to\r\nConstantinople, from Odessa one to Alexandria and Vladivostok.\r\n\r\nDespite this miserable condition of Pontian navigation, from a European\r\npoint of view, it still has greater significance than navigation on\r\nother seas of Russia. Near the end of the past century, 70% of the\r\ntotal oversea exportation of Russia by weight, and 65% by value, went\r\nthru the harbors of the Ukrainian coast. To be sure, in 1896, only 7.5%\r\nof the ships which visited these ports sailed under the Russian flag.\r\nIn the year of 1911 it was not much different; of the outgoing ships\r\nonly 11.4%, and of the incoming ships only 13.9% carried the Russian\r\nflag!\r\n\r\nAmong the Black Sea ports, Odessa, now, as ever, takes first place. The\r\nimports of Odessa, in 1911, amounted to 19.2 million q., the exports\r\n26.2 million q. This, by the way, is an example of the great\r\npreponderance of exportation over importation. In other ports the\r\ndisparity is even greater. Thus, the imports of Mikolaiv amount to only\r\n2.3 million q., the exports 22.8 million q. For Tahanroh the respective\r\nfigures are 1.9 and 19.5, for Novorossysk 1.5 and 18.3, for Mariupol\r\n3.1 and 16.2, for Kherson 1.1 and 11.3, for Feodosia 0.6 and 4.8, for\r\nRostiv 2.1 and 2.4, for Berdiansk 0.3 and 3.9, for Eupatoria 0.8 and\r\n2.9, for Akerman 0.4 and 2.0.\r\n\r\nThese figures once more bring before our eyes the ruinous effect of the\r\neconomic policy of the Russian Government upon the Ukraine. The natural\r\nresources of the Ukraine are exported in enormous masses, without\r\nconsideration of the needs of the Ukrainian population; the imports are\r\nto a great extent directed to other far distant coasts of the Russian\r\nEmpire, and Great Russia gets the advantage of them, while the Ukraine\r\nis flooded with the inferior goods of Central Russian industry. If we\r\nconsider, further, that an annual customs balance of 200 million rubles\r\ngoes to the central government from the Ukraine, an amount which is\r\nthen used for the development of the central provinces, we become able\r\nto understand under what unfavorable conditions the economic life of\r\nthe Ukraine must develop, and how dearly its progress must be paid for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRICTS AND SETTLEMENTS OF UKRAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor centuries robbed of its political independence, the Ukraine today\r\nsimply vegetates, instead of living in a state of full development. The\r\nfatal results of its lack of independence are visible in every aspect\r\nof the material and spiritual life of the country.\r\n\r\nThe present political-administrative division of the Ukraine is also a\r\nresult of the want of political independence of this nation. This\r\ndivision corresponds neither to the natural nor to the\r\nanthropogeographical conditions, and to a great degree represents only\r\nentirely antiquated, now worthless remnants of the statesmanship of\r\nformer centuries.\r\n\r\nEven the state boundaries are very unnaturally drawn in the Ukrainian\r\nterritory. The Austrian crown-province of Galicia embraces parts of\r\nRostoche, Volhynia, Podolia, Pokutye, while other parts of this natural\r\nterritory lie outside the state border, in Russia. The topography and\r\nthe people are the same on both sides of the cordon; only the state\r\nauthorities and the ruling races are different. The Carpathian boundary\r\nbetween the Austrian and Hungarian parts of the Ukraine, to be sure,\r\nseems a good natural boundary, but in reality it would be that only if\r\nit ran along the southern foot of the range. For the Carpathian region\r\nof the Ukraine, as a result of its easy communications constitutes not\r\nonly a physico-geographical, but also an anthropogeographical unit. On\r\nboth sides of the border live the same Lemkos, Boikos and Hutzuls.\r\n\r\nMore glaringly still does the unnaturalness of the present political\r\ndivision of the Ukraine stand out, when we view the administrative\r\nunits in the framework of the states which at present dominate the\r\nUkraine. In Hungary, the Ukrainian part of the land is united into one\r\ngreat whole, together with Slavonia, Transylvania, Alföld, Banat, etc.\r\nAll is centered in Budapest. Even the boundaries of the autonomous\r\ncountries are so constructed that, besides a piece of Ukrainian\r\nterritory, they embrace an equally great or even greater, but, at any\r\nrate, heavily peopled piece of a foreign national territory, e.g., of\r\nthe Roumanian, Magyar, Slovenian. As a result of this scattering\r\nallotment, the Ukrainians of Hungary possess no political influence.\r\n\r\nThe same is the case in the Austrian parts of the Ukraine. Galicia\r\nproper, which is inhabited by Ukrainians, the nucleus of the ancient\r\nUkrainian Kingdom of Halich, which, in its physico-geographical aspect,\r\nis wholly a part of Eastern Europe, is welded together with the\r\nso-called Western Galicia, properly a part of Little Poland\r\n(grand-duchy of Cracow), which is inhabited entirely by Poles and\r\nbelongs physically to Central Europe, both halves constituting together\r\none administrative unit. The result of this unnatural union is the\r\nbitter racial struggle of century-long duration between the Poles and\r\nUkrainians, a struggle which is still going on without prospect of\r\npeace, and is very unfavorable for the beneficial development of the\r\nland. The Ukrainians are fighting for equal rights and against\r\nPolonization; the Poles, in the name of their state tradition, for\r\ntheir hegemony in the land and for the forcible assimilation of the\r\nUkrainians. The only remedy which presents itself would be the division\r\nof the present crown-province of Galicia into two crown-provinces, an\r\neastern Ukrainian, and a western Polish province. The present\r\ncrown-province of Bukowina also consists of parts of Pokutye, Pidhirye\r\nand the Ukrainian Carpathians, together with a part of the Roumanian\r\nCarpathian foothills. This circumstance again brings about a national\r\nstruggle between the Ukrainians and the Roumanians.\r\n\r\nThe greatest portion of the country, the Russian Ukraine, also suffers\r\nfrom an unnatural political division. The Ukrainian territory is\r\ndivided into several great administrative districts, or groups of\r\ngovernments. Parts of the Ukrainian national territory lie in the\r\nVistula Governments in Western, Southwestern, Southern and Little\r\nRussia and Caucasia. The boundaries of the individual governments\r\neverywhere are drawn without consideration for natural and ethnographic\r\nconditions. In this way the border districts of the unbroken Ukrainian\r\nterritory have been united with parts of foreign racial territories\r\ninto artificial administrative units, as, for example, the Governments\r\nof Lublin and Sidlez (the present Government of Kholm), Grodno, Minsk,\r\nKursk, Voroniz, Don region, Stavropol, Bessarabia, etc. This\r\ncircumstance being a result of the poor development of constitutional\r\nlife in Russia, has no great significance now, but may in the future\r\nbecome as unfavorable for the Ukraine as is the similar condition today\r\nin Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe anthropogeography of today in describing a land, very seldom takes\r\nsuch artificial divisions into consideration. Then there is the\r\nadditional circumstance that these divisions, as is obvious, have no\r\nphysico-geographical value. In like manner, the division of Russia\r\n“according to natural and economic characteristics,” by Arseniev,\r\nSemyonoff, Richter, Fortunatov, etc., are worthless for geographical\r\npurposes. The most suitable of any of them is that of Richter, which\r\ngives the Ukrainian territory an independent position. A good division\r\nalso comes from M. Drahomaniv, but it is not suitable for a\r\ngeographical description.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons we shall keep to the natural districts which we\r\ndescribed in Book I. Such a division is the only justifiable one in a\r\ncountry which, like the Ukraine, has no political independence.\r\n\r\nThe Carpathian region constitutes the first natural district of the\r\nUkraine. It is populated by three Ukrainian mountain-tribes—the Lemkos\r\n(from Poprad to the Oslava), the Boikos (together with Tukholzians,\r\nfrom the Oslava to the Limnitzia) and the Hutzuls (from the Limnitzia\r\nto the Roumanian ethnographic border). The population is everywhere\r\nthinly strewn, especially in the Boike country. The agriculture of the\r\nregion is not sufficient at any point to nourish even the sparse\r\npopulation. The Lemkos and Boikos carry on a little farming (oats,\r\npotatoes), the Hutzuls only along the edge of the mountains.\r\nCattle-raising, with dairying, forestry and lumbering, and among the\r\nHutzuls their fine home industry as well, constitute the main sources\r\nof sustenance of the mountain dwellers. Every year a large percentage\r\nof the population goes out for seasonal migrations.\r\n\r\nThe settlements of the Ukrainian Carpathians all have the character of\r\nvillages. The Lemko and Boiko villages usually form long rows of farms,\r\nwhich extend along the valley bottom. The Hutzulian villages, on the\r\nother hand, consist of separate farms which lie scattered on valley\r\nsides, valley plains, and even valley spurs. The huts are everywhere\r\nbuilt of wood, and covered with shingles or boards; only among the\r\nBoikos, sometimes, with straw. The very practical block houses, adapted\r\nto the climate, which are built by the Hutzuls, look very neat.\r\n\r\nThere are no cities in the Carpathian region, but only small towns,\r\ninhabited for the most part by Jews, and bristling with dirt. The Lemko\r\ncountry (Lemkivshchina) has only one larger town, Sianik (11,000\r\ninhabitants), with railway-car factories. Also noteworthy, on the\r\nHungarian side, are the little towns of Svidnik and Strupkiv, on the\r\nGalician side the resorts of Krinitzia, Zeghestiv, Vissova, Rimaniv. In\r\nthe little towns of the adjacent Polish (New Sandetz, Gorlice, Gribov,\r\nDukla) and Slovenian territory (Bartfeld) the Lemkos supply their needs\r\nin industrial products and grain.\r\n\r\nIn the Boiko country (Boikivshchina) the towns are little centers for\r\nthe retail trade and the lumber industry, as for instance, Turka on the\r\nStriy (11,000 pop.), Lisko on the San, Stari Sambir on the Dniester,\r\nand Skole on the Opir (match manufacture). The village of Smorze is\r\nnoted for its cattle fairs, Sinevidsko for its fruit trade. Along the\r\nOpir valley lie numerous summer resorts (Tukhla, Slavsko).\r\n\r\nIn the Hutzul country, too, there are many summer resorts, particularly\r\nin the valley of the Prut (Dora, Yaremche, Mikulichin, Tatariv,\r\nVorokhta). The Hutzuls make their purchases in the little towns which\r\nlie at the exit of the main passes of the range—in Nadvirna\r\n(saw-mills), Delatin (salt-works), in Kossiv, noted for its mild\r\nclimate, its flourishing home industry and fruit-culture and its\r\nsalt-works, in Kuti, where tanning and furriery flourish, and in\r\nViznitza (saw-mills and lumber industrial school). In the center of the\r\nHutzul country lies the large Hutzulian village of Zabye. There are\r\nnoted mineral springs in Burkut and Pistin. On the southern slope of\r\nthe range lies the only city of the Hutzul country (21,000 pop.) and\r\nthe town of Hust (10,000 pop.), both important as trade centers of the\r\nHungarian Hutzul country.\r\n\r\nIn the southern sub-Carpathian zone the Ukrainian territory extends\r\nforward but a slight distance. The economic conditions of the mountain\r\nrange suddenly give way to agriculture and vine-growing. All the cities\r\nof the region lie on the borders of the Ukrainian territory at the\r\npoints of exit of important railroad lines and highroads out of the\r\nmountains. Such is the position of Uzhorod (17,000 pop.) and Mukachiv\r\n(17,000 pop.) where the products of the plain and the mountains are\r\nexchanged.\r\n\r\nThe Galicia-Bukowina sub-Carpathian hill country (Pidhirye) forms a\r\ngentle transition from the mountains to the plain. With the great\r\nwealth of forest and meadow and a not very fertile soil, agriculture\r\nbegins to predominate but slowly as we depart from the limits of the\r\nmountain district. Besides, the great abundance of salt and petroleum\r\ndemands many hands. The villages of the Pidhirye are as a rule, not\r\nlarge; the huts are regularly covered with straw. Here we find the\r\nrather unattractive type of the Galician cities and towns. Their chief\r\ncharacteristic is unfathomable mud or unfathomable dust on the streets,\r\ndepending on the season of the year. Only the suburbs inhabited by the\r\nUkrainian city-farmer population appear at all friendly, with their\r\norchards and their little white-painted houses. The center of the city\r\nis regularly taken up by the Jews. Their houses, as a rule, defy all\r\nideas of cleanliness and hygiene, and, amid bristling dirt, the retail\r\ntrade surges thru miserable booths and shops. Almost nowhere in the\r\nGalician cities do we find wholesale trade or industry on a large\r\nscale, in the European sense. The Christian middle-class does not\r\nexist, and the educated class of the city population is represented by\r\nofficials (usually Poles, and, in decreasing proportions, Ukrainians).\r\n\r\nOn the western borderlands of the Ukraine, in this region, lies the\r\ncity of Yaroslav on the San (25,000 pop.), a railway junction in an\r\nimportant strategic position. Founded by the ancient Ukrainian princes\r\nof Kiev, Yaroslav was once famous for its annual fairs. Near it, on the\r\nSan, lies Radimno with its rope industry. But the most important city\r\non the San is Peremishl (57,000 pop.), at once one of the oldest cities\r\nof Galicia and the one-time capital of the Ukrainian dynasty of the\r\nRostislavids. Peremishl owes its importance to its position as a bridge\r\ncity at a point where important roads from the west and northwest cross\r\nthe San to the east and south. It lies at the important junction of the\r\nGalician main railroad line, with the important Lupkov line coming from\r\nHungary, and is accordingly, as a result of its position, a first-class\r\nfortress, which closes the San valley and cuts off access to the\r\nadjacent Carpathian passes. The commercial standing of the city is\r\nconsiderable; here, too, a Greek-Catholic bishopric has its seat, and\r\nhere there exist numerous Ukrainian cultural and economic societies.\r\n\r\nIn the sub-Carpathian Dniester region, which is traversed lengthwise by\r\nthe Galician Transversal Railroad, lie a number of important cities. On\r\nthe Dniester we find Sambir (21,000 pop.) at the crossing of the\r\nrailroads, with a lumber industry of some size. On the Tismenitza\r\nRailroad lies Borislav (15,000 pop.), but recently a little Boike\r\nvillage, now, together with the adjacent towns of Tustanovichi (12,000\r\npop.) and Skhidnitza, the center of petroleum and ozokerite production.\r\nA forest of artesian wells, factory chimneys, petroleum reservoirs,\r\nhave sprung up amid the famous “Borislav mud,” among miserable dirty\r\nhouses which shelter so many millionaires and hungry wretches, so much\r\nhappiness and misery, crime and immorality. The refineries for the\r\npetroleum that is gained here are located mostly in the adjacent\r\nDrohobich (39,000 pop.), the seat of the petroleum speculators. Salt\r\nworks also are found in this city, still greater ones in the adjacent\r\nStebnik, where enormous deposits of salt have been discovered, but thus\r\nfar not been exploited. Truskavetz is a well-known watering-place.\r\n\r\nOn the Striy lies the important railroad junction of Striy (33,000\r\npop.), with a mill, lumber and match industry, the seat of the\r\nUkrainian dairymen’s association and other Ukrainian organizations; at\r\nthe mouth of the Striy the ancient town of Zidachiv. On the\r\nsub-Carpathian Transversal Railroad toward the east, lie the following:\r\nthe watering-place Morshin, Bolekhiv with salt-works and match\r\nfactories Dolina with salt-works and saw-mills, Kalush with\r\nsaltpeter-mining and salt-works. Stanislaviv (over 60,000 pop.),\r\nsituated at the junction of the two Bistritza rivers, is an important\r\nrailway center in which the Lemberg-Czernowitz Railroad meets the\r\nTransversal railroad, the South Polish Railroad and the Hungarian\r\nbranch railroad to Marmarosh. The city has an important industrial and\r\ncommercial activity, and is the seat of the Greek-Catholic bishopric.\r\nStanislaviv has inherited the former importance of Halich, the one-time\r\ncapital of the Ukrainian Kingdom of the same name, which, at its\r\nhighest development, reached the Polissye swamps on the north, the\r\nDnieper on the east, the Black Sea and the Danube delta on the south.\r\nAt that time (11th and 12th Century), Halich equalled or surpassed in\r\nsize, wealth and commercial importance, most of the capitals of Western\r\nEurope. After a thousand years of Polish dominion it is now a miserable\r\ntown in a beautiful location, important geographically for its traffic\r\nadvantages. A side-line here branches off from the main railroad into\r\nPodolia. Attempts are being made to enliven Dniester navigation, which\r\nbegins here and in Zuravno at the mouth of the Svicha. Not far from\r\nStanislaviv lie Tovmach, Tismenitza (10,000 pop.) with a leather\r\nindustry, and Ottinia with a machine industry of some size.\r\n\r\nIn the Galician Prut region, Kolomia (45,000 pop.) is the most\r\nimportant city, at the junction of sub-Carpathian and Pokutian railroad\r\nlines, with an important commerce and pottery industry. Further to the\r\neast, on the Prut, lies Zabolotiv with a tobacco factory and Sniatin\r\n(12,000 pop.) with an active commerce and agricultural production.\r\nDzuriv and Novoselitza have lignite mines. In the sub-Carpathian\r\ncountry of the Bukowina, the capital city, Czernowitz, developed in one\r\ncentury from a miserable village to a city of 93,000 inhabitants.\r\nCzernowitz has some industry and considerable commerce. Important\r\nrailroads lead from here, via Novoselitza to Russia, and via Itzkany to\r\nRoumania. Czernowitz is the seat of the most eastern German University\r\n(but several professors lecture in Ukrainian), a Greek-Catholic\r\nmetropolitan, and numerous Ukrainian organizations. In nearby Sadahora,\r\nwell-frequented annual fairs take place. The cities carrying on a\r\nlively trade, Seret, Storozhinetz (10,000 pop.), Radivtzi (17,000\r\npop.—the city with the great breeding-stud), and Suchava (12,000 pop.),\r\nall lie on the boundary of the Ukrainian and Roumanian-speaking\r\npopulations. Katshka possesses large salt-works.\r\n\r\nThe Rostoche, which embraces a part of Northern Galicia and the\r\nsouthern part of the Government of Kholm (eastern borderlands of the\r\nGovernments of Lublin and Sidletz), is, for the most part, an\r\nagricultural country, altho the forest areas, which are still rather\r\nlarge, have retained their once flourishing lumber industry. The\r\nvillages of this region are large, but consist, as a rule, of scattered\r\nhamlets and lone farms. There are not many cities in the Rostoche\r\nregion, but on its southern border we find one of the most important in\r\nthe Ukraine, the ancient royal city of Lviv (Lemberg, 220,000 pop.).\r\n\r\nThe importance of the geographical position of Lemberg is in the fact\r\nthat it lies at the point of the easiest passage from the low country\r\nof the Buh to the west, and into the Carpathian country across the\r\nUkrainian group of plateaus, which is narrowest here. Lemberg commands\r\nall the more important roads of the Western Ukraine, and, after their\r\nunion, leads them westward. Lemberg is the greatest railroad center of\r\nall the Ukraine; nine railroads as well as eight highroads converge\r\nhere from all parts of the continent. The thing that has contributed\r\nmost to the remarkable growth of Lemberg in the last half-century,\r\nbesides the railroads, is its position as the capital of Galicia, that\r\nlargest of the Austrian crown-provinces. Founded about the middle of\r\nthe 13th Century by the Ukrainian princes of Halich, Danilo and Lev,\r\nLemberg, about the middle of the 14th Century, fell under Polish rule.\r\nHere industry and commerce flourished in the 15th and 16th Centuries,\r\nthanks to the German middle-class of the city; then Lemberg declined\r\nirresistibly until it came under Austria’s dominion as a little town,\r\nfrom which time on, it flourished again. At present Lemberg is the\r\ntrade center of Ukrainian-Galicia and shows some industrial progress\r\n(brick-kilns, breweries, alcohol distilleries, railroad shops, etc.).\r\nAs a result of recent rapid development, the character of the city is\r\nalmost wholly modern; the number of historical landmarks is not large.\r\nLemberg is the seat of three archbishops, a University with several\r\nUkrainian chairs, a technical and a commercial college, as well as many\r\ntrade schools and intermediate schools. Lemberg is also one of the\r\nchief centers of Ukrainian cultural life, and the seat of many\r\nimportant Ukrainian societies and institutions.\r\n\r\nIn the Galician Rostoche region there are besides Lemberg, only small\r\ntowns: Zovkva, Yavoriv (10,000 pop.), with lumber industry, Rava\r\n(11,000 pop.). At the railroad junction, Nemiriv with mineral springs,\r\nPotilich with a considerable pottery industry. Mosti veliki, the large\r\nvillage of Kaminka voloska (10,000 pop.), Belz, formerly a Ukrainian\r\nroyal residence. On the Buh lie the following: the old town of Busk,\r\nKaminka strumilova, Sokal, at the point where more active river\r\nnavigation begins.\r\n\r\nIn the Kholm Rostoche, the most important city is Kholm (20,000 pop.),\r\nfounded, like Lemberg, by Prince Danilo, now a Jewish city carrying on\r\na lively trade in the agricultural products of this fertile region, and\r\nthe capital of the Government of the same name. Tarnohorod and Tomashiv\r\nare notorious for their smuggling, Bilhoray is known for its sieve\r\nindustry, Hrubeshiv and Zamostye (12,000 pop.) for their trade in\r\nfoodstuffs.\r\n\r\nA country of similar anthropogeographical character is the adjacent\r\nplain of Pidlassye. This country embraces the northern part of the\r\nGovernment of Kholm and the southern part of the Government of Grodno.\r\nFertile stretches of land, with large villages, here alternate with\r\nlarge wooded areas (the virgin forest of Biloveza) and swamp areas, in\r\nwhich small villages and hamlets predominate. The most important city\r\nof the Pidlassye is the fortress of Berestia (57,000 pop.) on the\r\nMukhavetz, the eastern base of the fortress quadrangle of the Vistula\r\nregion and an important railroad center, where five lines meet with the\r\nDnieper-Buh Canal. Besides its very considerable commerce, Berestye has\r\ngreat historical reminiscences of the union of the orthodox church with\r\nRome, accomplished here in 1596. On the left bank of the Buh lie the\r\ncommercial cities of Vlodava and Bila (13,000 pop.), on the Mukhavetz\r\nlies Kobrin (10,000 pop.), and in the neighborhood of the Bilovez\r\nForest, the ancient Kamenetz-Litovsky and Bilsk.\r\n\r\nThe neighboring Ukrainian country in the east is the Ukrainian\r\nPolissye. It embraces the southern part of the Government of Minsk, on\r\nthe right shore of the Zna and the Pripet, and the northern lowland\r\nregion of the Governments of Volhynia and Kiev. As a result of the\r\ndecided preponderance of forest and swamp, agriculture must retire to\r\nthe background, and confine itself only to the small number of higher\r\nand more fertile places. There are not such great obstacles to\r\ncattle-raising, but forestry and lumber-floating play the most\r\nimportant part. The most important city of the Polissye is Pinsk\r\n(37,000 pop.), situated on the navigable Pina, where the Dnieper-Buh\r\nCanal and the Dnieper-Niemen Canal connect with the Pripet system. Here\r\nbegins the regular steamship navigation of the Pripet, here there are\r\nlarge saw-mills, match factories, shipyards, beer and mead breweries\r\nand tobacco factories, and here active commerce and lumber-floating\r\nflourish. Another important river port is Davidhorodok on the mouth of\r\nthe Horin, the people of which carry on ship-building and\r\nriver-navigation and engage in sausage-making and cheese-making.\r\nFarther down the river is the antique Turiv, a former royal city, now a\r\nmiserable little town with a population of farmers and timber-floaters.\r\nThe equally antique town of Mosir (12,000 pop.) has retained a greater\r\nsignificance, with a good river harbor, ship-building industry and\r\nmatch-making. The last important port on the Pripet is Chornobil.\r\n\r\nIn the Volhynian Polissye, Kovel (17,000 pop.), situated on the\r\nnavigable Turia, is, above all, an important railroad center, which\r\ncarries on a considerable trade in agricultural products and wood.\r\nAnother important railroad center is Sarni on the Sluch. The antique\r\ntown of Orruch on the Norin is rich in swamp-ores and pottery-clay.\r\n\r\nThe natural district of Volhynia embraces only the Volhynian Plateau,\r\ntogether with the wide river plains, which penetrate far into the heart\r\nof the Plateau. To Volhynia, then, belongs the southern part of the\r\npresent Government of Volhynia, as well as a small strip of the\r\nGovernment of Kiev, on the left bank of the Teterev. Here agriculture\r\nforms the main occupation of the people. Forestry and lumbering become\r\nless important. With regard to the manner of settlement, Volhynia still\r\nhas a suggestion of the adjacent regions in the west and north, with\r\ntheir small villages, hamlets and single farms. In the east it begins\r\nto assume the genuine Ukrainian character, with large villages and\r\ncountry towns. The cities and towns of Volhynia are, as a rule, not\r\nlarge, inhabited chiefly by Jews, dirty and neglected, surpassing in\r\nthis respect even the typical Galician villages and towns. On the\r\nGalician side there is only one city worthy of mention, namely Brodi\r\n(18,000 pop.), which carries on a considerable trade in agricultural\r\nand animal products, as well as some lively smuggling. On the Russian\r\nside the following may be enumerated, from west to east: Volodimir\r\nvolinsky (10,000 pop.), formerly a royal city, now a miserable Jewish\r\ntown with some lumber and grain trade and smuggling. Lutzk, Dubno and\r\nRivne form the Volhynian triangle of forts directed against Austria.\r\nLutzk (32,000 pop.) is an old royal city at the junction of roads which\r\ncross the navigable Stir at this point, and carries on a considerable\r\ntrade, as well as a cloth and leather industry of some dimensions;\r\nDubno (14,000 pop.), on the Ikva, is known for its once famous annual\r\nfairs; Rivne (39,000 pop.) carries on a considerable trade with grain,\r\nlive-stock, alcohol, etc. Along the Austrian border lie: Berestechko on\r\nthe Stir, memorable for the unhappy battle fought by Khmelnitsky\r\nagainst the Poles (1651); Radiviliv, opposite Brody, the main seat of\r\nsmuggling; Pochayiv, a famous place of pilgrimage, and simultaneously a\r\nden of smugglers.\r\n\r\nKremianetz (18,000 pop.) on the Ikva, a strong fortress in the days of\r\nthe Ukrainian princes, now carries on a considerable grain trade. On\r\nthe Horin, at the point where that river becomes navigable, lies Ostroh\r\n(15,000 pop.), with many ruins, the former residence of the Princes of\r\nOstrohsky, who founded an academy here in the 16th Century, and made of\r\nOstroh an important spiritual center of the Ukraine of that time.\r\nZaslav (13,000 pop.), likewise on the Horin, was once the residence of\r\nthe Princes of Zaslavsky. Both cities carry on some trade in grain\r\ntoday. On the Sluch lie the cities of Starokonstantiniv (17,000 pop.),\r\nfounded by the Princes of Ostrohsky, with considerable export of grain\r\nand cattle, and Novhorod-Volinsky (Zviahel, 17,000 pop.), rich in\r\nmarsh-ore and pottery-clay. Korez (10,000 pop.) is famous for its\r\nporcelain clay. Just on the border of Volhynia lies its administrative\r\ncenter, Zitomir (93,000 pop.). This old city lies at the edge of the\r\nforest and agricultural regions, carries on a considerable trade in\r\ngrain and wood, salt and sugar, and has an important clothing, leather\r\nand tobacco industry. Downstream, on the Teterev, lies the little\r\ncommercial city of Radomishl (11,000 pop.).\r\n\r\nPodolia’s natural territory embraces the most eastern part of Galicia\r\nand almost the entire Government of Podolia, besides the northern\r\nborderlands of Kherson. Podolia is a purely agricultural region; its\r\nmanufacturing is limited to home industry, besides some mills,\r\ndistilleries and sugar factories. The Podolian villages are large as a\r\nrule, lie in rows in the cañon valleys, while, on the height of the\r\nplateau, usually only single farms and hamlets are seen. The huts are\r\nalmost all built of loam and covered with straw. City settlements are\r\nrare and small, all insignificant emporiums for agricultural and animal\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nOn the western edge of Galician-Podolia lie Horodok (13,000 pop.), on a\r\nlarge pond formed by the Vereshitza, and Lublin, with sulphur baths; on\r\nthe Hnila Lipa, the antique city of Rohatin; on the Zlota Lipa,\r\nBerezani (13,000 pop.), with a large pond; on the Koropetz River there\r\nare Pidhaitzi and Monastiriska, with a tobacco factory; on the Stripa\r\nRiver, Zboriv, memorable for the decisive victory of Khmelnitsky over\r\nthe Poles and for the treaty of 1649 following, which allowed the\r\nUkraine almost complete autonomy—within the framework of the Polish\r\nstate. Downstream, on the Stripa, lies the commercial city of Buchach\r\n(14,000 pop.). On the northern boundary of Podolia, already in the Buh\r\nregion, lie Zolochiv (13,000 pop.) and Sassiv, with a paper and pottery\r\nindustry. On the Sereth, and in its district, lie Zbaraz, memorable for\r\nthe victory of Khmelnitsky (1648); Ternopil (34,000 pop.), the most\r\nimportant railroad center and commercial city of Podolia, with a large\r\ngrain, cattle and alcohol trade; Terebovla, a former Ukrainian prince’s\r\nresidence; Chortkiv, a center of Podolian local railroads. On the\r\nSbruch, the only town worth mention is the border town and border\r\nstation of Pidvolochiska-Volochiska. In the Dniester cañon there is\r\nonly one important place. Salishchiki, with considerable fruit-culture.\r\nAll the cities of Galician-Podolia are bridge cities, and lie at\r\nconvenient crossings over the left tributaries of the Dniester. All\r\nthese crossings were once guarded by castles, about which cities were\r\nlater developed.\r\n\r\nIn Russian-Podolia the number of cities and towns is still smaller. The\r\ncapital of the Government of Kamenetz Podilsky (50,000 pop.), lies on\r\nthe Smotrich, and was at one time an important border-fortress against\r\nthe Turks. To this day the city has no railroad connections, hence its\r\ncommercial importance is very slight. The adjacent Zvanetz is memorable\r\nbecause of the Khmelnitsky campaign (1653). On the Dniester, whose\r\nentire valley is covered with fruit orchards and vineyards, lies the\r\nimportant river port of Mohiliv (33,000 pop.), with considerable\r\nlumber, grain and fruit trade; Ushitza with a fruit trade; the river\r\npart of Yampol on the Dniester rapids. In the region and the valley of\r\nthe Boh lie Proskuriv (41,000 pop.), a genuine village-city with\r\nconsiderable trade; Pilavtzi, memorable because of the complete defeat\r\nsuffered there by the Poles (1648); Meziboz, in an important strategic\r\nposition against the Austrian border; Letichiv and Khmelnik (11,000\r\npop.), surrounded by orchards; on the Shar R., Litin (10,000 pop.); on\r\nthe Rivi the once famous Bar (11,000 pop.), now a miserable town;\r\nfurther downstream on the Boh, Vinnitza (48,000 pop.), once a Cossack\r\ncity, memorable because of a defeat of the Poles (1651), now a lively\r\ncommercial city. The former capital of the palatinate of Bratzlav is\r\nnow entirely insignificant, likewise the new Olhopil on the Savranka.\r\nThe only commercial city of any importance in Southern Podolia is the\r\nmuddy Balta, which, in its famous annual fairs, trades in grain,\r\ncattle, bacon and skins, but especially pumpkins and melons, and has a\r\nsoap and candle industry of some importance. The adjacent city of\r\nAnaniiv (17,000 pop.) also carries on considerable trade in\r\nagricultural products.\r\n\r\nThe Pokutian-Bessarabian Plateau embraces a narrow zone of Southeastern\r\nGalicia and the Northern Bukowina, as well as the northern part of the\r\nRussian Government of Bessarabia. The manner of settling is similar to\r\nthe Podolian, with large villages and few small cities. Agriculture and\r\nwine-growing are the most important occupation of the people; toward\r\nthe south cattle-raising is becoming of greater importance. Home\r\nindustry is insignificant, of factory industry there is almost none. In\r\nGalician-Pokutye the only cities worthy of mention are Horodenka\r\n(11,000 pop.), in a very fertile region, and the old commercial city of\r\nSniatin (12,000 pop.), and in Bukowina-Pokutye the commercial town of\r\nKitzman. In Bessarabia we find, on the Dniester, the former fortress of\r\nKhotin (18,000 pop.), memorable for two Turkish battles (1621 and\r\n1673), now a river port and the seat of an active grain and fruit\r\ntrade, as well as a notorious nest of smugglers. The second Dniester\r\nport of Bessarabia, Soroki (15,000 pop.), serves principally the export\r\ntrade. At some distance from the course of the Dniester lies the\r\ninsignificant town of Orhüv (13,000 pop.), and the dirty city of Biltzi\r\n(19,000 pop.), with a large grain and cattle trade. The capital of\r\nBessarabia, Kishiniv (125,000 pop.), lies outside of the Ukrainian\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper Plateau is important, not only because of its agriculture,\r\ncattle-raising and fruit-culture, but also because of a considerable\r\ncultivation of commercial plants, because of a developed home and\r\nfactory industry, and because of a comparatively lively trade. It is\r\none of the central districts of the Ukraine, with typical conditions of\r\nsettlement. Large agglomerations of dwellings, picturesquely located,\r\nconsisting of whitewashed, straw-covered clay huts, lie on the rivers\r\nand creeks, usually on wide valley bottoms or slightly inclined valley\r\nsides, surrounded and dotted with the fresh green of orchards. On the\r\nplateau, which is one great wave of never-ending grain-fields, there\r\nlie only a few scattered manors of large landowners, single farmhouses,\r\nbee orchards, adjoining little woodlands and groves. The number and\r\nsize of the cities is not great. The prevailing type is that of the\r\nvillage city—a great village with an area of buildings in the middle,\r\nwhich have a city-like character. The streets are broad and unpaved,\r\nthe green of the gardens being apparent even in the center of the city.\r\nWhere the northeastern spurs of the Dnieper Plateau reach the Dnieper\r\nRiver, lies the natural capital of the Ukraine, the former “mother of\r\nthe Ruthenian cities,” Kiev (506,000 pop.). Its great history finds\r\nexpression in an enormous number of architectural monuments, especially\r\nchurches and convents. (Lavra Pecherska, the Church of Sophia, the\r\nChurch of Andreas, the Tithe Church, the Golden Gate, etc.). Kiev was\r\nthe capital of the ancient Ukrainian Kingdom and its spiritual center;\r\ntoday it is called the “Ukrainian Jerusalem,” and is visited by\r\nhundreds of thousands of pilgrims every year. Besides its historical\r\nimportance, Kiev possesses also a great geographical significance. Its\r\npicturesque position on the lofty right-hand bank of the Dnieper, which\r\nis cut up into beautiful erosive hills, offers great geographical\r\nadvantages. Here, opposite the Desna outlet, the Dnieper, after\r\nreceiving its two largest tributaries, completes its transformation\r\ninto the second largest river of Eastern Europe. The waterways of the\r\nPripet, the upper Dnieper and the Desna here form a junction, the\r\nimportance of which is heightened by the junction of railroads and\r\nhighways at the same point; such thorofares have always found in Kiev\r\nthe most convenient crossing over the Dnieper River into the Western\r\nUkrainian lands. This junction of roads favors the rapidly progressing\r\ndevelopment of Kiev’s commerce, which concentrates in the “lower city”\r\n(Podil) and in its great river harbor. Kiev is the most convenient\r\nemporium for the forest and grain regions of the Ukraine, which border\r\non one another here. In the last decades a considerable factory\r\nindustry has developed in Kiev, embracing all possible branches of\r\nindustry. Above all, the sugar industry has its center here. Kiev has a\r\nRussian University and a technical college. Ukrainian cultural life,\r\nwhich has always had its main headquarters in Kiev, has experienced an\r\nunexpected rise here since 1905.\r\n\r\nNot far from Kiev, which is an important fortress today, there lie many\r\nplaces of historical significance, among them the convents of\r\nVidubitsky and Mezihirsky. Rzishchiv is a river port with some grain\r\nexportation. On the Stuhna lies the old city of Vassilkiv (18,000\r\npop.), with an insignificant trade, from a modern point of view. At the\r\npoint where the borders of the Governments of Kiev, Volhynia and\r\nPodolia touch, lies Berdichiv, a city of 83,000, inhabited mostly by\r\nJews, after Kiev the most important emporium for cattle and grain in\r\nthe country. The products of the industry of this place are offered for\r\nsale by Jewish peddlers thruout the entire right half of the Ukraine.\r\nIn the river region of the Ross we find several cities which are local\r\ncenters of the sugar and alcohol industry: Skvira (16,000 pop.), in a\r\nregion covered with ancient walls, with pottery and cap manufactures;\r\nthe old Cossack city of Bila Tserkov (61,000 pop.), famous for the\r\ntreaty of Khmelnitsky with the Poles (1652), now a lively commercial\r\ncity, with sugar and machine manufactures; Tarashcha (11,000 pop.),\r\nwith a considerable wagon industry (the familiar tarantasses are made\r\nhere). Korsun is noteworthy because of the victory of Khmelnitsky over\r\nthe Poles (1648). Nearby lie the villages of Kirilivka and Morintzi,\r\nthe home of the greatest Ukrainian poet, Taras Shevchenko.\r\n\r\nThe entire plateau zone along the right Dnieper bank is full of old\r\nmonuments of Ukrainian history, of walls, ancient fortifications, ruins\r\nand barrows. Along the Dnieper lie in succession: Trekhtimiriv, Kaniv,\r\nCherkassi, once the most important center of the Ukrainian Cossack\r\norganization Near Kaniv, elevated on the lofty right bank of the\r\nDnieper, is the mound of Shevchenko, visited every year by numerous\r\ncompanies of pilgrims of all classes of the Ukrainian nation. Kaniv is\r\nnow a little town with an insignificant river harbor. Cherkassi (40,000\r\npop.), on the other hand, thanks to its large river harbor and the\r\nrailroad which crosses the Dnieper here, has developed into a lively\r\ncommercial city (wood, iron, sugar and salt trade, lumber and sugar\r\nindustry). By the example of Cherkassi or Kreminchuk, we are shown how\r\nthe poor villages and towns on the Dnieper could be developed if\r\ncultural conditions were favorable. A fine example of such a neglected\r\ntown is Chihirin (10,000 pop.), on the Tiasmin, the former residence\r\ncity of the Ukrainian hetmans. Situated, as tho by a wonderful\r\ncoincidence, in the center of the present Ukrainian territory, Chihirin\r\nis hardly more than a large village, with crooked, muddy streets, a\r\nslight lumber and grain trade, remains of the Chumak organization, and\r\nan insignificant stonecutters’ trade. In Subotiv, nearby, Khmelnitsky\r\nwas buried, but his grave was destroyed by the Poles a short time\r\nafter. At the Tiasmin outlet lies the river port of Kriliv (12,000\r\npop.), with lumber and cattle trade; further downstream,\r\nVerkhnodniprovsk, with an iron industry. At the source of the Inhuletz\r\nis Olexandria (14,000 pop.), noteworthy for some milling industry.\r\n\r\nOn the southwestern and southern border of the Dnieper Plateau, which\r\nis really part of the country drained by the Boh, there lie several\r\nsmaller towns, e.g., Lipovetz, Haisin, Novomirhorod, with some grain\r\nand cattle trade. In this respect, Zvenihorodka (17,000 pop.) is of\r\ngreater importance. Nearby lies Katerinopol, with its lignite mines.\r\nUman (42,000 pop.) is known because of its associations with the\r\nHaydamak times, its great park, and its considerable grain trade. The\r\nlargest city of this strip of borderland, Yelisavet (76,000 pop.), at\r\nthe source of the Inhul, carries on a considerable trade in grain and\r\nwool, and possesses an important factory industry.\r\n\r\nThe Dnieper Plain, in its northern part, reveals quite a Polissian\r\ncharacter. But in the north we note the first differences too—the\r\nhighly developed home industry and agriculture much more highly\r\ndeveloped than in the Polissye region. On the left Desna bank,\r\nlumbering declines gradually, and the villages of the Polissian type\r\ngive way to the typical Ukrainian villages, consisting of neatly\r\nwhitewashed, straw-covered huts, which lie picturesquely among\r\nfruit-gardens. The towns and suburbs here, as in fact everywhere in the\r\nleft half of the Ukraine, have an entirely rural appearance. The cities\r\nhave very wide streets and squares. There are very few connected rows\r\nof houses, and the single houses are surrounded by gardens and large\r\nyards. The Dnieper Plain embraces the greatest part of the Governments\r\nof Chernihiv and Poltava, and the northern edge of Katerinoslav.\r\n\r\nThe chief city of the northern half of the section is Chernihiv (33,000\r\npop.), an old city, perhaps as ancient as Kiev. It lies at the crossing\r\nof the main road leading to Muscovy, across the navigable Desna. In the\r\ncity and its vicinity we find many historical monuments, churches,\r\nwalls and barrows; but the present commercial importance of the city is\r\nvery slight. Konotop (20,000 pop.), surrounded by swamps, and at one\r\ntime a strong fortress, famous for the victory of the Cossack hetman,\r\nVihovsky, over the Russians (1659), now carries on a considerable\r\ncommerce, thanks to its railroad junction, and has large peat deposits.\r\nBakhmatch, which lies nearby, is an important railroad junction. On the\r\nSem lies the commercial town of Baturin, the former hetman residence,\r\nwhose population was completely slaughtered by Menshikov in 1709.\r\nSosnitza, Borsna (12,000 pop.) and Berezna (10,000 pop.) carry on an\r\ninsignificant grain and cattle trade. On the navigable Oster lies Nizin\r\n(52,000 pop.), an old city of the time of the Ukrainian princes, in the\r\n17th Century a Greek colony carrying on a lively trade, later famous\r\nfor its great annual fairs. Just now the tobacco and grain trade of the\r\ncity is increasing considerably. There is also a philological academy\r\nhere. Further downstream, on the Oster, we find two old towns, Koseletz\r\nand Oster, with a river harbor and a considerable net industry. On the\r\nTrubaylo and on the Alta lies the ancient city of Pereyaslav (15,000\r\npop.), founded by Volodimir the Great, noteworthy for the victory of\r\nthe Cossack hetman, Taras Triasilo, over the Poles (1630). Here the\r\nunfortunate treaty of 1654 was enacted, joining the Ukraine, which had\r\njust been freed from Polish rule, to Russia, as an autonomous vassal\r\nstate. The once navigable Trubaylo has become shallow, the railroad\r\nline has left the city lying to one side and Pereyaslav has lost all\r\nsignificance. Equally insignificant is the adjacent town of\r\nZolotonosha.\r\n\r\nIn the Sula region, on the verge of the Dnieper Plain, lies Romen\r\n(Romni, 33,000 pop.), with annual fairs that are important even today,\r\nthe center of the judicial district of Romni-Libau, which transports\r\nthe products of the Ukraine to the distant Baltic ports. Romen has a\r\nsoap industry and tobacco factories, and here and in the adjacent town\r\nof Lokhvitzia, fruit and tobacco culture flourish. The center of\r\nUkrainian tobacco-culture is Priluky (31,000 pop.), on the Udai, which\r\ncarries on the greatest tobacco trade in all Russia, exporting half a\r\nmillion puds of it annually. On the Udai also lies the old Cossack city\r\nof Piriatin, now an important railroad center. Below the outlet of the\r\nUdai into the Sula, lies ancient Lubni (10,000 pop.), with its great\r\nfruit-gardens and tanneries.\r\n\r\nIn the region drained by the Psiol, we find on the Khorol, the old\r\nCossack city of Mirhorod (10,000 pop.), so masterfully pictured by\r\nGogol, with its industrial school and its great home industry. Mirhorod\r\nwas once an important center of the Chumak organization. Not far from\r\nit lies the railroad center of Romodan and the antique town of Khorol.\r\nHadyach is noteworthy because of the treaty of the Cossack hetman,\r\nVihovsky, with Poland (1658), which was to join the Ukraine as the\r\nthird autonomous unit to the Polish-Lithuanian state. Sinkiv (10,000\r\npop.) is an important center of a versatile home industry; Rashivka, a\r\ncenter of the Prassoli societies; Sorochintzi, the birthplace of Gogol,\r\nhas grain and cattle markets; Reshetilivka is famous for its\r\nsheep-raising and its leather industry. Above the outlet of the Psiol\r\ninto the Dnieper, lies the chief river port of the region, Kreminchuk\r\n(99,000 pop.), an important bridge city, where numerous highways and\r\ntwo railroads cross the navigable Dnieper. Kreminchuk trades,\r\nparticularly in lumber and grain, is an emporium for lumber, coal and\r\nsalt, and has machine, tobacco, carriage and leather factories, and\r\nlarge saw-mills. The city is subject to many floods and conflagrations,\r\nbut is growing constantly. Half of the population is comprised of\r\nJewish merchants and business men. In the spring the population of the\r\ncity is regularly doubled. On the opposite Dnieper bank lies the river\r\nport of Krukiv (10,000 pop.), almost a suburb of Kreminchuk.\r\n\r\nIn the river region of the Vorskla, on the northeastern boundary of the\r\nplain, lies Oposhnia, widely known for its pottery. Farther downstream\r\nlies the city of Poltava (83,000 pop.), the chief city of the southern\r\npart of the left half of the plain, notable for the unfortunate battle\r\n(1709) in which Peter the Great, with Polish help, destroyed the plan\r\nof the dashing hetman, Mazeppa, to free the Ukraine from Russian\r\ndominion, with the aid of Charles XII. of Sweden. Today Poltava is a\r\nrising industrial city, with an important railroad junction and great\r\nannual fairs, chiefly for wool and horses. Kobeliaki (12,000 pop.),\r\nsituated downstream on the Vorskla, has a cloth industry of some\r\ndimensions, as has also the district of Konstantinohrad, in the river\r\nregion of the Orel. On the southeastern border of the plain, where it\r\njoins the Pontian plain in the region of the Samara, lie the old\r\nZaporog settlements of Samarchik (Novonoskovsk, 13,000 pop.) and\r\nPavlohrad (41,000 pop.), with a considerable grain trade and a large\r\nmill, leather and wax industry.\r\n\r\nThe spurs of the Central Russian Plateau, which lie within the borders\r\nof the Ukrainian national territory offer an almost complete\r\nanthropogeographical analogy to the above discussed district. In the\r\nnorth the Polissian character is still apparent. In the south\r\nagriculture and home industry are well developed. Traffic is more\r\ndifficult, because of the greater distance to the navigable Dnieper,\r\nbut is rather active with the Muscovite country. The left plateau\r\ndistrict embraces the northwest frontiers of the Governments of\r\nChernihiv and Poltava, all of the Government of Kharkiv and the\r\nadjacent districts of Kursk, Voroniz and Don.\r\n\r\nThe northernmost town of the Ukraine is Mhlin, with its important\r\nannual fairs. In the vicinity lies Pochep, with some textile industry\r\nand Klintzi (12,000 pop.), the “Manchester of the Chernihiv country,”\r\nwith spinning-mills, cloth, leather and metal factories. The\r\ninhabitants of nearby Ardon engage in carriage-making, and carry on\r\npeddling thruout the entire Ukraine. Considerable industry and trade is\r\ncarried on also by Novosibkiv (16,000 pop.) and Klimiv. Starodub\r\n(13,000 pop.), the old Cossack city, on the other hand, is rich in\r\nhistorical reminiscences. The ancient town of Novhorod Siversky, on the\r\nDesna, and Korop, downstream, are insignificant today. Kluhiv (15,000\r\npop.) carries on a considerable grain trade. In the vicinity lies\r\nShostka, with a powder factory which supplies all the powder factories\r\nof Russia with salpeter. Krolevetz (10,000 pop.) still has important\r\nannual fairs, the old town of Putivl some trade in grain and flax,\r\nBilopilye (15,000 pop.), important annual fairs and a great grain\r\ntrade. In the country about the source of the Sula lies Nedrihailiv; at\r\nthe source of the Psiol is Sudza (13,000 pop.), with a large grain,\r\nhoney and fruit trade. Miropilye (11,000 pop.), has an important shoe\r\nindustry, Sumi (52,000 pop.), situated at a railroad junction, has an\r\nimportant factory industry (especially sugar factories) and important\r\nannual fairs. The old Cossack city of Lebedin (14,000 pop.), famous\r\nbecause of the atrocities of Menshikov (1708), now carries on a\r\nconsiderable grain trade.\r\n\r\nIn the region of the source of the Vorskla lies the town of Hraivoron,\r\ndownstream Okhtirka (32,000 pop.), a much frequented place of\r\npilgrimage, with considerable fruit-culture and lumber, fur, shoe,\r\npottery and milling industries. Considerable fruit-culture is carried\r\non also by Bohodukhiv.\r\n\r\nThe farther part of the left plateau lies in the region drained by the\r\nDon. On the small rivers, Kharkiv and Lopan, lies the capital of the\r\nregion, Kharkiv (248,000 pop.). Founded as a Cossack hamlet in the 17th\r\nCentury, Kharkiv has grown very rapidly, thanks to its geographical\r\nposition at a convenient crossing point from the Dnieper region into\r\nthe Don region, between the interior and the sea. Here was once a\r\ncrossing of Chumak roads, and is now a railroad junction. Hence the\r\nimportance of Kharkiv lies in commerce. Four great fairs, whose\r\nbusiness still amounts to 80 million rubles a year, on an average, are\r\nespecially important for trade in grain, horned cattle, horses, wool\r\nand manufactures. Besides, Kharkiv has a considerable factory industry\r\n(linen, cloth, soap, candle, sugar, alcohol, tobacco, brick, ceramic,\r\nmachine, boiler and bell factories). Kharkiv is the seat of a Russian\r\nUniversity, and one of the chief centers of Ukrainian cultural life.\r\n\r\nIn the east of the Donetz course lie several small cities, e.g.,\r\nZolochiv, with its annual fairs; Valki, with a considerable home\r\nindustry and large fruit-gardens. In the country about the source of\r\nthe Donetz, on the border of the Ukraine, lies Bilhorod (22,000 pop.),\r\na commercial city with a woolen industry. Downstream, on the Donetz,\r\nlie Vovchansk (11,000 pop.), Chuhuyiv (13,000 pop.) and Smiiv. Korocha\r\n(14,000 pop.) carries on grain, cattle and fruit trade in its annual\r\nfairs, and has some industry (oil-pressing, alcohol-distillation, and\r\nalbumen manufacture). On the Oskol lie the following: Stari-Oskol\r\n(17,000 pop.), with a considerable trade and with a leather, wax, mead\r\nand tobacco industry; the insignificant town of Novi-Oskol, Valuiki,\r\nUrasova (13,000 pop.), with grain trade, tanneries and rope factories;\r\nKupiansk at a railroad junction. On the Tikha Sosna lies Biriuch\r\n(13,000 pop.), with annual fairs and oil factories, Olexiyivka, known\r\nfor sunflower-culture and painters’ guilds, and Ostrohorsk (22,000\r\npop.), with a large grain, cattle and bacon trade, and soap, wax and\r\ntobacco industry, once a center of the fish trade. Starobilsk (13,000\r\npop.) has lively annual fairs.\r\n\r\nOn the Don, within the province of the plateau, there are no larger\r\ncities. Korotoiak (10,000 pop.) carries on an active trade, Pavlovsk\r\nhas soap factories, fat-extraction and oil-presses, and is an important\r\nriver-port, from which the regular Don navigation begins. Altogether,\r\non the eastern border country of the Ukraine, there are no larger\r\ncities or even towns. Only a few isolated large villages gain greater\r\nsignificance thru their markets and industry. One of these is the\r\nlargest village of the Ukraine: Buturlinivka (38,000 pop.), with\r\nimportant annual fairs, with brick-kilns, tanneries, alcohol-stills, as\r\nwell as very considerable furriery and shoemaking.\r\n\r\nThe Donetz Plateau is, from an anthropogeographical point of view, a\r\nvery remarkable country, which has its closest analogy in the North\r\nAmerican mining districts. Only the northern edge of the country on the\r\nDonetz has an appearance analogous to the adjacent Kharkiv country,\r\nwith large, typically Ukrainian villages and village-towns. All the\r\nremaining region of the Donetz Plateau is a naked steppe. Here and\r\nthere factory chimneys, isolated or in groups, rise, surrounded by\r\nfactory buildings and laborers’ huts. The settlements come into\r\nexistence and grow with true American speed. The Donetz Plateau\r\nembraces parts of the Governments of Kharkiv, Katerinoslav and Don.\r\n\r\nOne of the farthest advance guards of the typical Ukrainian settlements\r\nis Isium (23,000 pop.), on the Donetz, one of the chief centers of the\r\npottery industry. Slaviansk, once Tor (20,000 pop.), on the Torez, has\r\nlarge salt mines and salt lakes, with bathing pavilions, which draw\r\nmany guests in the summer, large salt-works and a number of mills,\r\nporcelain and metal industries. Besides, Slaviansk has important\r\nhorse-markets. Nearby, on the chalk-cliffs of the Donetz, lies the\r\nfamous convent of the Holy Mountains. On the eastern border of the\r\nUkraine, on the Donetz, lies the river port of Kamenske (51,000 pop.),\r\nwith a great grain trade and glass-works.\r\n\r\nIn the mining and factory district of the Donetz Plateau there lie,\r\nbesides innumerable small industrial towns, a number of more important\r\ncenters. Luhan (60,000 pop.) has a large metallurgical industry with\r\nfoundries and hammer-works, machine-factories, numerous alcohol-stills,\r\nbreweries, tanneries, soap and tile factories. Bakhmut (33,000 pop.)\r\nhas large salt mines and salt-works and considerable trade; the\r\nadjacent town of Mikitivka, mercury and coal mines. Yusivka (49,000\r\npop.) is the chief center of the coal mines, iron and steel factories;\r\nHrushivka (46,000 pop.) the center of the anthracite mines.\r\n\r\nThe Pontian Plain gives us an anthropogeographical picture which is\r\ndifferent from that of the thus far described sections of the Ukraine.\r\nHere, in the newly settled steppe region, the type of the Ukrainian\r\nsettlements gradually disappears. The Ukrainian type of the large\r\nvillages remains, to be sure, but these villages are, by their\r\nposition, dependent upon the water as well as other conditions of a\r\npractical nature, such as roads, mines, etc., which tempt a great\r\nnumber of people to settle in the district. The huts here and there\r\nbear the marks of provisional buildings, are not always whitewashed,\r\nare covered with reeds, and in some places even earthen huts have been\r\npreserved. As a rule, however, the typical Ukrainian whitewashed and\r\nstraw-covered clay hut advances farther and farther, and is sometimes\r\neven prettier and better equipped here than in Northern Ukraine, thanks\r\nto the greater prosperity of the peasant. In the last few years more\r\nand more brick houses have been built, covered with tiles. Extensive\r\nsteppe agriculture and steppe cattle-raising have, to this time, been\r\nthe chief occupation; on the coast, salt-extraction and navigation.\r\nTypical Ukrainian towns are rare here, but in the once wild steppes, on\r\nthe other hand, large commercial and industrial cities have shot up,\r\nwhich possess a much more European appearance than the Russian cities.\r\nAlmost all these cities lie on the sea, or at the river outlets. The\r\nPontian Plain embraces the southern parts of Bessarabia, Kherson,\r\nKaterinoslav, the mainland part of Tauria, the southwestern part of the\r\nDon region and the northern part of the Kuban region.\r\n\r\nOn the Kilia arm of the Danube delta lie the following important river\r\nports, at the same time the centers of the Danube trade and of the\r\nsea-fishing industry: Ismail (36,000 pop.), Kilia (12,000 pop.) and\r\nVilkiv. Akerman (40,000 pop.), on the Dniester liman, rich in\r\nhistorical memories, is an important harbor for smaller ships, and\r\ncarries on a considerable salt, fish, bacon and woolen trade. On the\r\nlower course of the Dniester lie the river ports of Dubosari (13,000\r\npop.), located in the midst of vineyards and fruit-gardens and tobacco\r\nfields, with a considerable tobacco, wine, cattle and grain trade;\r\nBenderi (60,000 pop.), a strong fortress with a considerable trade,\r\nsurrounded by fruit-gardens, vineyards and melon-patches and Teraspol\r\n(32,000 pop.) with a large grain trade. Here the goods shipped down the\r\nDniester are unloaded, to be sent by rail to Odessa.\r\n\r\nOdessa (620,000 pop.), the largest city and the most important port of\r\nthe Ukraine, is situated 32 kilometers north of the Dniester outlet,\r\nand opposite the Dnieper liman, on a deep but open roadstead. By means\r\nof expensive constructions, the unprotected harbor of Odessa was\r\nconsiderably improved. It now has six protected harbor basins for\r\nships. In some winters the harbor does not freeze over, at other times\r\nremaining frozen from 31 to 67 days, but then it can be kept open\r\nwithout difficulty by ice-breakers. The city itself is built up on the\r\nhigh and naked steppe plain, where orchards can be planted and taken\r\ncare of only with the greatest difficulty. The city has an entirely\r\nEuropean appearance, with broad, straight streets and fine houses.\r\nThere are almost no historic landmarks in Odessa, since it was founded\r\nas late as 1794. The city grew very rapidly, especially in its\r\nfree-harbor period (1817–1859). Today Odessa is the most important\r\nseaport of the Russian Empire, after St. Petersburg, and even surpasses\r\nthe latter in exports. The exports from Odessa are made up chiefly of\r\ngrain, also cattle, wood, sugar, fishing products, fats and alcohol.\r\nThese exports go to England, Germany, France, Italy, Holland, Belgium\r\nand the far east. The imports of Odessa are disproportionately smaller\r\nthan the exports, and are made up chiefly of coal, rice, tropical\r\nfruits, tea, etc., the benefit of which goes mostly to the cities of\r\nCentral Russia. Outside of this commercial activity, which is directed\r\nby the stock exchange and the numerous banks, Odessa also possesses a\r\nwell-developed factory industry (mills, sugar, oil, macaroni,\r\ncanned-goods, alcohol, metal, ceramic, and chemical factories). About\r\nthe year 1900, the annual productive value was 70 million rubles.\r\nOdessa is also a university city, and one of the intellectual centers\r\nof the Ukraine. In the vicinity of Odessa are the famous limans of\r\nKuyalnik and Khadzybei, with their sanatoriums.\r\n\r\nOn the Boh, at the point where the river becomes navigable, lies\r\nVosnesensk, an important river port, with some industry and\r\nconsiderable wood and grain trade. On the deep Boh liman, at the mouth\r\nof the Inhul, lies Mikolaiv (103,000 pop.), a very important naval and\r\ncommercial harbor, which has the greatest exportation of grain, after\r\nOdessa, and large shipyards, foundries and machine-shops. Krivi Rih\r\n(15,000 pop.), on the Inhul, has 33 iron mines, and is the center of\r\nUkrainian iron mining.\r\n\r\nOn the Dnieper, on the border of the Pontian and Dnieper Plains, lies\r\nthe city of Katerinoslav (218,000 pop.), hardly more than a century\r\nold. Katerinoslav owes its great importance to its position on the\r\nDnieper at the beginning of the rapids section, and at the end of the\r\nupper steamboat navigation, where an important railroad line crosses\r\nthe river, connecting the iron mines of Krivi Rih with the coal fields\r\non the Donetz. Hence, Katerinoslav is, above all, an industrial city\r\nwith large foundries, forges and machine shops. Katerinoslav carries on\r\nthe greatest lumber trade in the entire Ukraine. Its grain and coal\r\ntrade is very important too. Below the rapids, in the old Zaporog\r\ncountry, sacred to every Ukrainian, lies the rapidly rising city of\r\nOlexandrivsk (51,000 pop.), an important river port and railroad\r\njunction, with a metal and milling industry. Nikopol (17,000 pop.), the\r\npoint of crossing of the old commercial road over the Dnieper into\r\nCrimea, is the center for manganese mining, and has some milling\r\nindustry. Its harbor is exceptional in that it is reached by smaller\r\nsea-vessels, which, however, sail up the Dnieper only as far as\r\nBerislav (12,000 pop.), where the grain is transferred from river boats\r\nto sea-vessels. On the left Dnieper bank, opposite Berislav, lies the\r\nimportant river harbor of Kakhivka. Oleshki has considerable vegetable,\r\nfruit and melon-culture, fishing and crab-fishing.\r\n\r\nNot far from the outlet of the Dnieper into its liman, lies the\r\ngovernment capital, Kherson (92,000 pop.), like Odessa, Mikolaiv and\r\nKaterinoslav, a young city of the end of the 18th Century. Its harbor\r\nwas first made accessible to large sea-vessels by the dredging of the\r\nship-canal of Otshakiv in the Dnieper liman (1887), and since then the\r\ncity has been growing rapidly. Kherson carries on a very important\r\nlumber and grain trade, and has large saw-mills, grain-mills, soap and\r\ntobacco factories. Two fortresses defend the entrance to the Dnieper\r\nliman, Ochakiv (12,000 pop.), with an insignificant harbor for coast\r\nvessels, and Kinburn.\r\n\r\nIn the narrow strip of low country on the north shore of the Black Sea,\r\nall the larger cities keep close to the coast. Melitopol on the\r\nMolochna (17,000 pop.), carries on considerable trade in cattle,\r\nlumber, skins, eggs and wool, and has large mills, alcohol-stills and\r\nfactories, which make agricultural machinery. Berdiansk (36,000 pop.),\r\ndespite its poor harbor, exports much grain, and has machine factories,\r\nmills, breweries, and fine fruit gardens and vineyards. The former\r\ngreat importance of Berdiansk has been inherited by Mariupol (53,000\r\npop.), with a good harbor at the mouth of the Kalmius, a city which\r\npossesses some factory industry, and carries on an active export trade\r\nin coal, coke, metal and grain. Still more important are the harbors at\r\nthe mouths of the Don. Opposite the Don delta lies Tahanroh (75,000\r\npop.) with a leather and metal industry, as well as an extensive trade\r\nin grain, fish, beef, oil, bacon, leather and fruit, the most important\r\ngrain exporting harbor of the Ukraine, after Odessa and Mikolaiv. In\r\nthe Don delta lies Rostiv (172,000 pop.), the most important commercial\r\ncity of Southeastern Ukraine, with an extensive trade in grain, cattle,\r\nwool and flax, large mills, shipyards, tobacco and machine factories.\r\nThe Armenian city of Nakhichevan (71,000 pop.) forms the suburbs, as it\r\nwere, of Rostiv, taking considerable part in its industrial and\r\ncommercial activity. The historically memorable city of Osiv (Azof,\r\n31,000 pop.) is an important center of the Don and Azof fishing\r\nindustry, and has some grain trade. Yesk (51,000 pop.), on the eastern\r\nshore of the Sea of Azof, has some grain export, and is a not\r\ninsignificant importing city.\r\n\r\nThe mountains and hill country of the Crimea are not properly a part of\r\nthe Ukrainian territory, altho the Ukrainian element flows into the\r\nvillages and cities of the land in an uninterrupted stream, while the\r\nMohammedan Tartar population emigrates to Turkey. In the northern part\r\nof the Crimean peninsula, the economic and settlement conditions are\r\nthe same as in the Pontian lowland. There is an especially important\r\ncattle-raising industry. In the southern, mountainous part of the\r\npeninsula, agriculture and cattle-raising lose their predominating\r\nimportance, and fruit, wine and vegetable-cultivation, navigation and\r\nsalt-making, which flourishes along almost the entire coast of the\r\nCrimea, comprise the chief occupations of the population. The chief\r\ncenter of salt-manufacture lies on the salt lakes and limans of\r\nEupatoria (30,000 pop.), where also famous sanatoriums are located. In\r\nthe northern foothills of the Yaila lies the ancient capital of the\r\nKhans, Bakchisarai (13,000 pop.), which has entirely preserved its\r\noriental character, as well as the new capital of Tauria, Simferopol\r\n(71,000 pop.), the center of the fruit and wine-culture and of\r\nimportant fruit-canning factories. An extensive fruit trade is carried\r\non also by Karasubazar (15,000 pop.).\r\n\r\nAt the gates of the Crimean Riviera is the city of Sevastopol (77,000\r\npop.), world renowned since the Crimean War, a great sea-fortress and\r\nthe strongest naval port of the Russian Empire in Europe. The\r\ncommercial harbor of the city has been without importance for the last\r\ntwelve years. In the vicinity, on a beautiful bay, lies Belklava, known\r\nfor its fisheries. On the southern coast is the following chain of\r\nwatering-places and summer-resorts: Alupka, Livadia, Yalta (23,000\r\npop.), Orianda, Alushta, Hursuf. In the summer patients and\r\nvacationists come here from all the cities of Russia, and the Riviera\r\nof Crimea is also growing continually in importance as a winter resort.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern spurs of the Crimean peninsula lie two large cities.\r\nFeodosia (formerly Kaffa, 40,000 pop.) is the largest commercial port\r\nof Crimea, with a considerable grain and fruit export. Kerch (57,000\r\npop.) also has a commercial port, used especially by large ships, which\r\nmust avoid the shallow Sea of Azof, but the city derives a much greater\r\nimportance from its extensive fishing industry, its fish-canning and\r\nmilling industry, and in recent years its metallurgical industry, which\r\nexploits the large mineral deposits of the region.\r\n\r\nThe sub-Caucasus country of Kuban, colonized a century ago by the\r\nposterity of the Zaporogs, offers, in its western part, an\r\nanthropogeographical picture quite analogous to the other central\r\nregions of the ancient Ukraine. It is actually a piece of the old\r\nUkraine, transplanted to the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, with its\r\nlarge villages, farms (khutori), its important agriculture and\r\nextensive cattle-raising. Fishing, lumbering and hunting play an\r\nimportant part in its economic life, besides fruit and wine-culture.\r\nThe mining industry is showing great promise.\r\n\r\nThe eastern and southern part of the sub-Caucasus country, which,\r\nbesides parts of Kuban, embraces also parts of the Government of\r\nStavropol and of the Black Sea and Terek regions, is a land newly\r\nsettled by the Ukrainians, and has a still imperfect\r\nanthropogeographical type.\r\n\r\nThe center of the land and of the Ukrainian cultural life is\r\nKaterinodar (100,000 pop.) on the Kuban, the capital of the Kuban\r\nCossacks. It carries on an active trade in agricultural products. The\r\nmain port of the region is the rising city of Novorossysk (61,000\r\npop.), with a large grain, wool and petroleum export. Temriuk, in the\r\nKuban delta, also exports much grain. On the Bila lies the commercial\r\ncity of Maikop (49,000 pop.); on the Luba, Labinsk (33,000 pop.), both\r\nimportant for the exchange of products of the plains and the mountains.\r\nOn the Stavropol Plateau lies Stavropol (61,000 pop.), with an\r\nimportant grain and cattle trade, Praskoveya (11,000 pop.), with\r\nconsiderable wine-culture, and Olexandrivsk (10,000 pop.). At the foot\r\nof the mountain range lies the renowned mineral spring region around\r\nthe commercial city of Piatihorsk (32,000 pop.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF BOOKS ON THE UKRAINE\r\n\r\n\r\nI.
