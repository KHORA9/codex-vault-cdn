That clever architect, the\r\nbird, teaches us as much; and the insect, with its still more diverse\r\ntalents, repeats the lesson, telling us that maternity is the supreme\r\ninspirer of instinct. Entrusted with the preservation of the species,\r\nwhich is of more importance than the preservation of individuals,\r\nmaternity awakens in the drowsiest intelligence marvellous gleams of\r\nforesight; it is the thrice sacred hearth where are kindled those\r\nmysterious psychic fires which will suddenly burst into flame and\r\ndazzle us with their semblance of infallible reason. The more maternity\r\nasserts itself, the higher does instinct ascend.\r\n\r\nIn this respect no creatures are more deserving of our attention than\r\nthe Hymenoptera, upon whom the cares of maternity devolve in their\r\nfulness. All these favourites of instinct prepare board and lodging for\r\ntheir offspring. They become master-craftsmen in a host of trades for\r\nthe sake of a family which their faceted eyes will never behold, but\r\nwhich is nevertheless no stranger to the mother’s powers of foresight.\r\nOne turns cotton-spinner and produces cotton-wool bottles; another sets\r\nup as a basket-maker and weaves hampers out of bits of leaves; a third\r\nbecomes a mason and builds rooms of cement and domes of road-metal; a\r\nfourth opens pottery-works, where clay is kneaded into shapely vases\r\nand rounded pots; yet another goes in for mining and digs mysterious\r\nunderground chambers in the warm, moist earth. A thousand trades\r\nsimilar to ours and often even unknown to our industrial system enter\r\ninto the preparation of the abode. Next come the provisions for the\r\nexpected nurselings: piles of honey, loaves of pollen, stores of game,\r\npreserved by a cunning paralysing-process. In such works as these,\r\nhaving the future of the family for their sole object, the highest\r\nmanifestations of instinct are displayed under the stimulus of\r\nmaternity.\r\n\r\nSo far as the rest of the insect race is concerned, the mother’s cares\r\nare generally most summary. In the majority of cases, all that is done\r\nis to lay the eggs in a favourable spot, where the larva, at its own\r\nrisk and peril, can find bed and breakfast. With such rustic ideas upon\r\nthe upbringing of the offspring, talents are superfluous. Lycurgus\r\nbanished the arts from his republic on the ground that they were\r\nenervating. In like manner the higher inspirations of instinct have no\r\nhome among insects reared in the Spartan fashion. The mother scorns the\r\nsweet task of the nurse; and the psychic prerogatives, which are the\r\nbest of all, diminish and disappear, so true is it that, with animals\r\nas with ourselves, the family is a source of perfection.\r\n\r\nWhile the Hymenopteron, so extremely thoughtful of her progeny, fills\r\nus with wonder, the others, which abandon theirs to the accidents of\r\ngood luck or bad, must seem to us, by comparison, of little interest.\r\nThese others form almost the whole of the entomological race; at least,\r\namong the fauna of our country-sides, there is, to my knowledge, only\r\none other example of insects preparing board and lodging for their\r\nfamily, as do the gatherers of honey and the buriers of well-filled\r\ngame-bags.\r\n\r\nAnd, strange to say, these insects vying in maternal solicitude with\r\nthe flower-despoiling tribe of Bees are none other than the\r\nDung-beetles, the dealers in ordure, the scavengers of the\r\ncattle-fouled meadows. We must pass from the scented blossoms of our\r\nflower-beds to the Mule-dung of our high-roads to find a second\r\ninstance of devoted mothers and lofty instincts. Nature abounds in\r\nthese antitheses. What are our ugliness or beauty, our cleanliness or\r\ndirt to her? Out of filth, she creates the flower; from a little\r\nmanure, she extracts the thrice-blessed grain of wheat.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their disgusting occupation, the Dung-beetles are of a\r\nvery respectable standing. Their size, which is generally imposing;\r\ntheir severe and immaculately glossy attire; their portly bodies,\r\nthickset and compact; the quaint ornamentation of brow or thorax: all\r\ncombined make them cut an excellent figure in the collector’s boxes,\r\nespecially when to our home species, oftenest of an ebon black, we add\r\na few tropical varieties, a-glitter with gleams of gold and flashes of\r\nburnished copper.\r\n\r\nThey are the sedulous attendants of our herds, for which reason several\r\nof them are faintly redolent of benzoic acid, the aromatic of the\r\nSheep-folds. Their pastoral habits have impressed the nomenclators, too\r\noften, alas, careless of euphony, who this time have changed their tune\r\nand headed their descriptions with such names as Melibœus, Tityrus,\r\nAmyntas, Corydon, Mopsus and Alexis. We find here the whole series of\r\nbucolic appellations made famous by the poets of antiquity. Virgil’s\r\neclogues have lent their vocabulary for the Dung-beetles’\r\nglorification. We should have to go back to the Butterflies with their\r\ndainty graces to find an equally poetic nomenclature. In their case the\r\nepic names of the Iliad ring out, borrowed from the camps of Greek and\r\nTrojan and perhaps too magnificently bellicose for those peaceable\r\nwinged flowers whose habits in no wise recall the martial deeds of an\r\nAjax or an Achilles. Much better-imagined is the bucolic title given to\r\nthe Dung-beetles: it tells us the insect’s chief characteristic, its\r\npredilection for pasture-lands.\r\n\r\nThe dung-manipulators have as head of their line the Sacred Beetle or\r\nScarab, whose strange behaviour had already attracted the attention of\r\nthe fellah in the valley of the Nile, some thousand years before the\r\nChristian era. As he watered his patch of onions in the spring, the\r\nEgyptian peasant would see from time to time a fat black insect pass\r\nclose by, hurriedly trundling a ball of Camel-dung backwards. He would\r\nwatch the queer rolling thing in amazement, even as the Provençal\r\npeasant watches it to this day.\r\n\r\nNo one fails to be surprised when he first finds himself in the\r\npresence of the Scarab, who, with his head down and his long hind-legs\r\nin the air, pushes with might and main his huge pill, the source of so\r\nmany awkward tumbles. Undoubtedly the simple fellah, on beholding this\r\nspectacle, wondered what that ball could be, what object the black\r\ncreature could have in rolling it along with such vigour. The peasant\r\nof to-day asks himself the same question.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the Rameses and Thothmes, superstition had something to\r\nsay in the matter; men saw in the rolling sphere an image of the world\r\nperforming its daily revolution; and the Scarab received divine\r\nhonours: in memory of his ancient glory, he continues the Sacred Beetle\r\nof the modern naturalists.\r\n\r\nIt is six or seven thousand years since the curious pill-maker first\r\ngot himself talked about: are his habits thoroughly familiar to us yet?\r\nDo we know the exact use for which he intends his ball, do we know how\r\nhe rears his family? Not at all. The most authoritative works\r\nperpetuate the grossest errors where he is concerned.\r\n\r\nAncient Egypt used to say that the Scarab rolls his ball from east to\r\nwest, the direction in which the world turns. He next buries it\r\nunderground for twenty-eight days, the period of a lunary revolution.\r\nThis four weeks’ incubation quickens the pill-maker’s progeny. On the\r\ntwenty-ninth day, which the insect knows to be that of the conjunction\r\nof the sun and moon and of the birth of the world, he goes back to his\r\nburied ball; he digs it up, opens it and throws it into the Nile. That\r\ncompletes the cycle. Immersion in the sacred waters causes a Scarab to\r\nemerge from the ball.\r\n\r\nLet us not laugh overmuch at these Pharaonic stories: they contain a\r\nmodicum of truth mingled with the fantastic theories of astrology.\r\nMoreover, a good deal of the laughter would recoil upon our own\r\nscience, for the fundamental error of regarding as the Scarab’s cradle\r\nthe ball which we see rolling across the fields still lingers in our\r\ntext-books. All the authors who write about the Sacred Beetle repeat\r\nit; the tradition has come down to us intact from the far-off days when\r\nthe Pyramids were built.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing from time to time to wield the hatchet in the\r\novergrown thicket of tradition; it is well to shake off the yoke of\r\naccepted ideas. It is possible that, cleansed of its obscuring dross,\r\ntruth may at last shine forth resplendent, far greater and more\r\nwonderful than the things which we were taught. I have sometimes\r\nharboured these rash doubts; and I have no reason to regret it, notably\r\nin the case of the Scarab. To-day I know the sacred pill-roller’s story\r\nthoroughly; and the reader shall see how much more marvellous it is\r\nthan the tales handed down to us by the old Egyptians.\r\n\r\nThe early chapters of my investigations into the nature of instinct [1]\r\nhave already proved, in the most categorical fashion, that the round\r\npellets rolled hither and thither along the ground by the insect do not\r\nand indeed cannot contain germs. They are not habitations for the egg\r\nand the grub; they are provisions which the Sacred Beetle hurriedly\r\nremoves from the madding crowd in order to bury them and consume them\r\nat leisure in a subterranean dining-room.\r\n\r\nNearly forty years have elapsed since I used eagerly to collect the\r\nmaterials to support my iconoclastic assertions on the Plateau des\r\nAngles, near Avignon; and nothing has happened to invalidate my\r\nstatements; far from it: everything has corroborated them. The\r\nincontestable proof came at last when I obtained the Scarab’s nest, a\r\ngenuine nest this time, gathered in such quantities as I wished and in\r\nsome cases even shaped before my eyes.\r\n\r\nI have described my former vain attempts to find the larva’s abode; I\r\nhave described the pitiful failure of my efforts at rearing under\r\ncover; and perhaps the reader commiserated my woes when he saw me on\r\nthe outskirts of the town stealthily and ingloriously gathering in a\r\npaper bag the donation dropped by a passing Mule for my charges.\r\nCertainly, as things were, my task was no easy one. My boarders, who\r\nwere great consumers, or more correctly speaking great wasters, used to\r\nbeguile the tedium of captivity by indulging in art for art’s sake in\r\nthe glad sunshine. Pill followed on pill, all beautifully rounded, to\r\nbe abandoned unused after a few exercises in rolling. The heap of\r\nprovisions, which I had so painfully acquired in the friendly shadow of\r\nthe gloaming, was squandered with disheartening rapidity; and there\r\ncame a time when the daily bread failed. Moreover, the stringy manna\r\nfalling from the Horse and the Mule is hardly suited to the mother’s\r\nwork, as I learned afterwards. Something more homogeneous, more plastic\r\nis needed; and this only the Sheep’s somewhat laxer bowels are able to\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nIn short, though my earlier studies taught me all about the Scarab’s\r\npublic manners, for several reasons they told me nothing of his private\r\nhabits. The nest-building problem remained as obscure as ever. Its\r\nsolution demands a good deal more than the straitened resources of a\r\ntown and the scientific equipment of a laboratory. It requires\r\nprolonged residence in the country; it requires the proximity of flocks\r\nand herds in the bright sunshine. Given these conditions, success is\r\nassured, provided that one have zeal and perseverance; and these\r\nconditions I find to perfection in my quiet village.\r\n\r\nProvisions, my great difficulty in the old days, are now to be had for\r\nthe asking. Close to my house, Mules pass along the high-road, on their\r\nway to the fields and back again; morning and evening, flocks of Sheep\r\ngo by, making for the pasture or the fold; not five yards from my door,\r\nmy neighbour’s Goat is tethered: I can hear her bleating as she nibbles\r\naway at her ring of grass. Moreover, should food be scarce in my\r\nimmediate vicinity, there are always youthful purveyors who, lured by\r\nvisions of lollipops, are ready to scour the country to collect\r\nvictuals for my Beetles.\r\n\r\nThey arrive, not one but a dozen, bringing their contributions in the\r\nqueerest of receptacles. In this novel procession of gift-bearers, any\r\nconcave thing that chances to be handy is employed: the crown of an old\r\nhat, a broken tile, a bit of stove-pipe, the bottom of a spinning-top,\r\na fragment of a basket, an old shoe hardened into a sort of boat, at a\r\npinch the collector’s own cap.\r\n\r\n‘It’s prime stuff this time,’ their shining eyes seem to proclaim.\r\n‘It’s something extra special.’\r\n\r\nThe goods are duly approved and paid for on the spot, as agreed. To\r\nclose the transaction in a fitting manner, I take the victuallers to\r\nthe cages and show them the Beetle rolling his pill. They gaze in\r\nwonder at the funny creature that looks as if it were playing with its\r\nball; they laugh at its tumbles and scream with delight at its clumsy\r\nstruggles when it comes to grief and lies on its back kicking. A\r\ncharming sight, especially when the lollipops bulging in the\r\nyoungsters’ cheeks are just beginning to melt deliciously. Thus the\r\nzeal of my little collaborators is kept alive. There is no fear of my\r\nboarders starving: their larder will be lavishly supplied.\r\n\r\nWho are these boarders? Well, first and foremost the Sacred Beetle, the\r\nchief subject of my present investigations. Sérignan’s long screen of\r\nhills might well mark his extreme northern boundary. Here ends the\r\nMediterranean flora, whose last ligneous representatives are the\r\narboraceous heather and the arbutus-tree; and here, in all probability,\r\nthe mighty pill-maker, a passionate lover of the sun, terminates his\r\narctic explorations. He abounds on the hot slopes facing the south and\r\nin the narrow belt of plain sheltered by that powerful reflector.\r\nAccording to all appearances, the elegant Gallic Bolboceras and the\r\nstalwart Spanish Copris likewise stop at this line; for both are as\r\nsensitive to cold as he. To these curious Dung-beetles, whose private\r\nhabits are so little known, let us add the Gymnopleuri, the Minotaur,\r\nthe Geotrupes, the Onthophagi. They are all welcomed in my cages, for\r\nall, I am convinced beforehand, have surprises in store for us in the\r\ndetails of their underground business.\r\n\r\nMy cages have a capacity of about a cubic yard. Except for the front,\r\nwhich is of wire gauze, the whole is made of wood. This keeps out any\r\nexcessive rain, the effect of which would be to turn the layer of earth\r\nin my open-air appliances into mud. Over-great moisture would be fatal\r\nto the prisoners, who cannot, in their straitened artificial demesne,\r\nact as they do when at liberty and prolong their digging indefinitely\r\nuntil they come upon a medium suitable to their operations. They want\r\nsoil which is porous and not too dry, though in no danger of ever\r\nbecoming muddy. The earth in the cages therefore is of a sandy\r\ncharacter and, after being sifted, is slightly moistened and flattened\r\ndown just enough to prevent any landslips in the future galleries. Its\r\ndepth is barely ten or eleven inches, which is insufficient in certain\r\ncases; but those of the inmates who have a fancy for deep galleries,\r\nlike the Geotrupes for instance, are well able to make up horizontally\r\nfor what is denied them perpendicularly.\r\n\r\nThe trellised front has a south aspect and allows the sun’s rays to\r\npenetrate right into the dwelling. The opposite side, which faces\r\nnorth, consists of two shutters one above the other. They are movable\r\nand are kept in place by hooks or bolts. The top one opens for food to\r\nbe distributed and for the cleaning of the cage; it is the kitchen-door\r\nfor everyday use. It is also the entrance-gate for any new captives\r\nwhom I succeed in bagging. The bottom shutter, which keeps the layer of\r\nearth in position, is opened only on great occasions, when we want to\r\nsurprise the insect in its home life and to ascertain the condition of\r\nthe progress underground. Then the bolts are drawn; the board, which is\r\non hinges, falls; and a vertical section of the soil is laid bare,\r\ngiving us an excellent opportunity of studying the Dung-beetles’ work.\r\nOur examination is made with the point of a knife and has to be\r\nconducted with the utmost care. In this way we get with precision and\r\nwithout difficulty industrial details which could not always be\r\nobtained by laborious digging in the open fields.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, outdoor investigations are indispensable and often yield\r\nfar more important results than anything derived from home rearing;\r\nfor, though some Dung-beetles are indifferent to captivity and work in\r\nthe cage with their customary vigour, others, who are of a more nervous\r\ntemperament or perhaps more cautious, distrust my boarded palaces and\r\nare extremely reluctant to surrender their secrets. It is only once in\r\na way that they fall victims to my assiduous wooing. Besides, if my\r\nmenagerie is to be run properly, I must know something of what is\r\nhappening outside, were it only to find out the right time of year for\r\nmy various projects. It is absolutely essential therefore that our\r\nstudy of the insect in captivity should be amply supplemented by\r\nobservations of its life and habits in the wild state.\r\n\r\nHere an assistant would be very useful to me, some one with leisure,\r\nwith a seeing eye and a simple heart, whose curiosity would be as\r\nunaffected as my own. This helper I have: such an one indeed as I have\r\nnever had before or since. He is a young shepherd, a friend of the\r\nfamily. He has read a little and has a keen desire for knowledge, so he\r\nis not frightened by the terms Scarabæus, Geotrupes, Copris or\r\nOnthophagus when I name the insects which he has dug up the day before\r\nand kept for me in a box.\r\n\r\nAt early dawn in the dog-days, when my insects are busy with their\r\nnest-building, you may see him in the meadows. When night falls and the\r\nheat begins to lessen, he is still there; and all day long, till far\r\ninto the night, he passes to and fro among the pill-rollers, who are\r\nattracted from every quarter by the reek of the victuals strewn by his\r\nSheep. Well-posted in the various points of my entomological problems,\r\nhe watches events and keeps me informed. He awaits his opportunity; he\r\ninspects the grass. With his knife he lays bare the subterranean cell\r\nwhich is betrayed by its little mound of earth; he scrapes, digs and\r\nfinds; and it all constitutes a glorious change from his vague pastoral\r\nmusings.\r\n\r\nAh, what splendid mornings we spend together, in the cool of the day,\r\nseeking the nest of the Scarab or the Copris! Old Sultan is there,\r\nseated on some knoll or other and keeping an autocratic eye upon the\r\nfleecy rabble. Nothing, not even the crust which a friend holds out to\r\nhim, distracts his attention from his exalted functions. Certainly he\r\nis not much to look at, with his tangled black coat, soiled with the\r\nthousands of seeds which have caught in it. He is not a handsome Dog,\r\nbut what a lot of sense there is in his shaggy head, what a talent for\r\nknowing exactly what is permitted and what forbidden, for perceiving\r\nthe absence of some heedless one forgotten behind a dip in the ground!\r\nUpon my word, one would think that he knew the number of Sheep confided\r\nto his care, his Sheep, though never a bone of them comes his way! He\r\nhas counted them from the top of his knoll. One is missing. Sultan\r\nrushes off. Here he comes, bringing the straggler back to the flock.\r\nClever Dog! I admire your skill in arithmetic, though I fail to\r\nunderstand how your crude brain ever acquired it. Yes, old fellow, we\r\ncan rely on you; the two of us, your master and I, can hunt the\r\nDung-beetle at our ease and disappear in the copsewood; not one of your\r\ncharges will go astray, not one will nibble at the neighbouring vines.\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that I worked, at early morn, before the sun grew\r\ntoo hot, in partnership with the young shepherd and our common friend\r\nSultan, though at times I was alone, myself sole pastor of the seventy\r\nbleating Sheep. And so the materials were gathered for this history of\r\nthe Sacred Beetle and his rivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first of the four volumes containing Fabre’s essays on\r\nBeetles, the order of insects to which, if we judge by his output, he\r\ndevoted the longest study. It will be followed in due course by The\r\nGlow-worm and Other Beetles, The Life of the Weevil, and More Beetles.\r\nThese three, however, will be issued, not in immediate succession, but\r\nturn by turn with books upon other insects; for the Souvenirs\r\nentomologiques, from which all or nearly all this material is taken,\r\nare still far from being exhausted.\r\n\r\nOf the eighteen chapters that make up the present volume, some have\r\nappeared, either complete or in a more or less abbreviated form, in\r\nvarious interesting illustrated miscellanies published independently of\r\nthe Collected Edition. Part of the Author’s Preface and the chapters\r\nentitled ‘The Sacred Beetle’ and ‘The Sacred Beetle in Captivity’ will\r\nbe found in Insect Life, prepared for Messrs. Macmillan and Co. by the\r\nauthor of Mademoiselle Mori. Similarly, the next three chapters on the\r\nSacred Beetle, the two treating of the Spanish Copris, the chapter on\r\nthe Onthophagi and Oniticelli, and the first two chapters on the\r\nGeotrupes form part of The Life and Love of the Insect, translated by\r\nmyself for Messrs. Adam and Charles Black and published in America by\r\nthe Macmillan Co.

There were five or six of us: myself, the\r\noldest, officially their master but even more their friend and comrade;\r\nthey, lads with warm hearts and joyous imaginations, overflowing with\r\nthat youthful vitality which makes us so enthusiastic and so eager for\r\nknowledge. We started off one morning down a path fringed with dwarf\r\nelder and hawthorn, whose clustering blossoms were already a paradise\r\nfor the Rose-chafer ecstatically drinking in their bitter perfumes. We\r\ntalked as we went. We were going to see whether the Sacred Beetle had\r\nyet made his appearance on the sandy plateau of Les Angles, [2] whether\r\nhe was rolling that pellet of dung in which ancient Egypt beheld an\r\nimage of the world; we were going to find out whether the stream at the\r\nfoot of the hill was not hiding under its mantle of duckweed young\r\nNewts with gills like tiny branches of coral; whether that pretty\r\nlittle fish of our rivulets, the Stickleback, had donned his wedding\r\nscarf of purple and blue; whether the newly arrived Swallow was\r\nskimming the meadows on pointed wing, chasing the Crane-flies, who\r\nscatter their eggs as they dance through the air; if the Eyed Lizard\r\nwas sunning his blue-speckled body on the threshold of a burrow dug in\r\nthe sandstone; if the Laughing Gull, travelling from the sea in the\r\nwake of the legions of fish that ascend the Rhone to milt in its\r\nwaters, was hovering in his hundreds over the river, ever and anon\r\nuttering his cry so like a maniac’s laughter; if ... but that will do.\r\nTo be brief, let us say that, like good simple folk who find pleasure\r\nin all living things, we were off to spend a morning at the most\r\nwonderful of festivals, life’s springtime awakening.\r\n\r\nOur expectations were fulfilled. The Stickleback was dressed in his\r\nbest: his scales would have paled the lustre of silver; his throat was\r\nflashing with the brightest vermilion. On the approach of the great\r\nblack Horse-leech, the spines on his back and sides started up, as\r\nthough worked by a spring. In the face of this resolute altitude, the\r\nbandit turns tail and slips ignominiously down among the water-weeds.\r\nThe placid mollusc tribe—Planorbes, Limnæi and other Water-snails—were\r\nsucking in the air on the surface of the water. The Hydrophilus and her\r\nhideous larva, those pirates of the ponds, darted amongst them,\r\nwringing a neck or two as they passed. The stupid crowd did not seem\r\neven to notice it. But let us leave the plain and its waters and\r\nclamber up the bluff to the plateau above us. Up there, Sheep are\r\ngrazing and Horses being exercised for the approaching races, while all\r\nare distributing manna to the enraptured Dung-beetles.\r\n\r\nHere are the scavengers at work, the Beetles whose proud mission it is\r\nto purge the soil of its filth. One would never weary of admiring the\r\nvariety of tools wherewith they are supplied, whether for shifting,\r\ncutting up and shaping the stercoral matter or for excavating deep\r\nburrows in which they will seclude themselves with their booty. This\r\nequipment resembles a technical museum where every digging-implement is\r\nrepresented. It includes things that seem copied from those\r\nappertaining to human industry and others of so original a type that\r\nthey might well serve us as models for new inventions.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Copris carries on his forehead a powerful pointed horn,\r\ncurved backwards, like the long blade of a mattock. In addition to a\r\nsimilar horn, the Lunary Copris has two strong spikes, curved like a\r\nploughshare, springing from the thorax and also, between the two, a\r\njagged protuberance which does duty as a broad rake. Bubas bubalis and\r\nB. bison, both exclusively Mediterranean species, have their forehead\r\narmed with two stout diverging horns, between which juts a horizontal\r\ndagger, supplied by the corselet. Minotaurus typhœus carries on the\r\nfront of his thorax three ploughshares, which stick straight out,\r\nparallel to one another, the side ones longer than the middle one. The\r\nBull Onthophagus has as his tool two long curved pieces that remind us\r\nof the horns of a Bull; the Cow Onthophagus, on the other hand, has a\r\ntwo-pronged fork standing erect on his flat head. Even the poorest\r\nhave, either on their head or on their corselet, hard knobs that make\r\nimplements which the patient insect can turn to good use,\r\nnotwithstanding their bluntness. All are supplied with a shovel, that\r\nis to say, they have a broad, flat head with a sharp edge; all use a\r\nrake, that is to say, they collect materials with their toothed\r\nfore-legs.\r\n\r\nAs some sort of compensation for their unsavoury task, several of them\r\ngive out a powerful scent of musk, while their bellies shine like\r\npolished metal. The Mimic Geotrupes has gleams of copper and gold\r\nbeneath; the Stercoraceous Geotrupes has a belly of amethystine violet.\r\nBut generally their colouring is black. The Dung-beetles in gorgeous\r\nraiment, those veritable living gems, belong to the tropics. Upper\r\nEgypt can show us under its Camel-dung a Beetle rivalling the emerald’s\r\nbrilliant green; Guiana, Brazil and Senegambia boast of Copres that are\r\na metallic red, rich as copper and ruby-bright. The Dung-beetles of our\r\nclimes cannot flaunt such jewellery, but they are no less remarkable\r\nfor their habits.\r\n\r\nWhat excitement over a single patch of Cow-dung! Never did adventurers\r\nhurrying from the four corners of the earth display such eagerness in\r\nworking a Californian claim. Before the sun becomes too hot, they are\r\nthere in their hundreds, large and small, of every sort, shape and\r\nsize, hastening to carve themselves a slice of the common cake. There\r\nare some that labour in the open air and scrape the surface; there are\r\nothers that dig themselves galleries in the thick of the heap, in\r\nsearch of choice veins; some work the lower stratum and bury their\r\nspoil without delay in the ground just below; others again, the\r\nsmallest, keep on one side and crumble a morsel that has slipped their\r\nway during the mighty excavations of their more powerful fellows. Some,\r\nnewcomers and doubtless the hungriest, consume their meal on the spot;\r\nbut the greater number dream of accumulating stocks that will allow\r\nthem to spend long days in affluence, down in some safe retreat. A\r\nnice, fresh patch of dung is not found just when you want it, in the\r\nbarren plains overgrown with thyme; a windfall of this sort is as manna\r\nfrom the sky; only fortune’s favourites receive so fair a portion.\r\nWherefore the riches of to-day are prudently hoarded for the morrow.\r\nThe stercoraceous scent has carried the glad tidings half a mile\r\naround; and all have hastened up to get a store of provisions. A few\r\nlaggards are still arriving, on the wing or on foot.\r\n\r\nWho is this that comes trotting towards the heap, fearing lest he reach\r\nit too late? His long legs move with awkward jerks, as though driven by\r\nsome mechanism within his belly; his little red antennæ unfurl their\r\nfan, a sign of anxious greed. He is coming, he has come, not without\r\nsending a few banqueters sprawling. It is the Sacred Beetle, clad all\r\nin black, the biggest and most famous of our Dung-beetles. Behold him\r\nat table, beside his fellow-guests, each of whom is giving the last\r\ntouches to his ball with the flat of his broad fore-legs or else\r\nenriching it with yet one more layer before retiring to enjoy the fruit\r\nof his labours in peace. Let us follow the construction of the famous\r\nball in all its phases.\r\n\r\nThe clypeus, or shield, that is the edge of the broad, flat head, is\r\nnotched with six angular teeth arranged in a semicircle. This\r\nconstitutes the tool for digging and cutting up, the rake that lifts\r\nand casts aside the unnutritious vegetable fibres, goes for something\r\nbetter, scrapes and collects it. A choice is thus made, for these\r\nconnoisseurs differentiate between one thing and another, making a\r\nrough selection when the Beetle is occupied with his own provender, but\r\nan extremely scrupulous one when it is a matter of constructing the\r\nmaternal ball, which has a central cavity in which the egg will hatch.\r\nThen every scrap of fibre is conscientiously rejected and only the\r\nstercoral quintessence is gathered as the material for building the\r\ninner layer of the cell. The young larva, on issuing from the egg, thus\r\nfinds in the very walls of its lodging a food of special delicacy which\r\nstrengthens its digestion and enables it afterwards to attack the\r\ncoarse outer layers.\r\n\r\nWhere his own needs are concerned, the Beetle is less particular and\r\ncontents himself with a very general sorting. The notched shield then\r\ndoes its scooping and digging, its casting aside and scraping together\r\nmore or less at random. The fore-legs play a mighty part in the work.\r\nThey are flat, bow-shaped, supplied with powerful nervures and armed on\r\nthe outside with five strong teeth. If a vigorous effort be needed to\r\nremove an obstacle or to force a way through the thickest part of the\r\nheap, the Dung-beetle makes use of his elbows, that is to say, he\r\nflings his toothed legs to right and left and clears a semicircular\r\nspace with an energetic sweep. Room once made, a different kind of work\r\nis found for these same limbs: they collect armfuls of the stuff raked\r\ntogether by the shield and push it under the insect’s belly, between\r\nthe four hinder legs. These are formed for the turner’s trade. They are\r\nlong and slender, especially the last pair, slightly bowed and finished\r\nwith a very sharp claw. They are at once recognised as compasses,\r\ncapable of embracing a globular body in their curved branches and of\r\nverifying and correcting its shape. Their function is, in fact, to\r\nfashion the ball.\r\n\r\nArmful by armful, the material is heaped up under the belly, between\r\nthe four legs, which, by a slight pressure, impart their own curve to\r\nit and give it a preliminary outline. Then, every now and again, the\r\nrough-hewn pill is set spinning between the four branches of the double\r\npair of spherical compasses; it turns under the Dung-beetle’s belly\r\nuntil it is rolled into a perfect ball. Should the surface layer lack\r\nplasticity and threaten to peel off, should some too-stringy part\r\nrefuse to yield to the action of the lathe, the fore-legs touch up the\r\nfaulty places; their broad paddles pat the ball to give consistency to\r\nthe new layer and to work the recalcitrant bits into the mass.\r\n\r\nUnder a hot sun, when time presses, one stands amazed at the turner’s\r\nfeverish activity. And so the work proceeds apace: what a moment ago\r\nwas a tiny pellet is now a ball the size of a walnut; soon it will be\r\nthe size of an apple. I have seen some gluttons manufacture a ball the\r\nsize of a man’s fist. This indeed means food in the larder for days to\r\ncome!\r\n\r\nThe Beetle has his provisions. The next thing is to withdraw from the\r\nfray and transport the victuals to a suitable place. Here the Scarab’s\r\nmost striking characteristics begin to show themselves. Straightway he\r\nbegins his journey; he clasps his sphere with his two long hind-legs,\r\nwhose terminal claws, planted in the mass, serve as pivots; he obtains\r\na purchase with the middle pair of legs; and, with his toothed\r\nfore-arms, pressing in turn upon the ground, to do duty as levers, he\r\nproceeds with his load, he himself moving backwards, body bent, head\r\ndown and hind-quarters in the air. The rear legs, the principal factor\r\nin the mechanism, are in continual movement backwards and forwards,\r\nshifting the claws to change the axis of rotation, to keep the load\r\nbalanced and to push it along by alternate thrusts to right and left.\r\nIn this way the ball finds itself touching the ground by turns with\r\nevery point of its surface, a process which perfects its shape and\r\ngives an even consistency to its outer layer by means of pressure\r\nuniformly distributed.\r\n\r\nAnd now to work with a will! The thing moves, it begins to roll; we\r\nshall get there, though not without difficulty. Here is a first awkward\r\nplace: the Beetle is wending his way athwart a slope and the heavy mass\r\ntends to follow the incline; the insect, however, for reasons best\r\nknown to itself, prefers to cut across this natural road, a bold\r\nproject which may be brought to naught by a false step or by a grain of\r\nsand that disturbs the balance of the load. The false step is made:\r\ndown goes the ball to the bottom of the valley; and the insect, toppled\r\nover by the shock, is lying on its back, kicking. It is soon up again\r\nand hastens to harness itself once more to its load. The machine works\r\nbetter than ever. But look out, you dunderhead! Follow the dip of the\r\nvalley: that will save labour and mishaps; the road is good and level;\r\nyour ball will roll quite easily. Not a bit of it! The Beetle prepares\r\nonce again to mount the slope that has already been his undoing.\r\nPerhaps it suits him to return to the heights. Against that I have\r\nnothing to say: the Scarab’s judgment is better than mine as to the\r\nadvisability of keeping to lofty regions; he can see farther than I can\r\nin these matters. But at least take this path, which will lead you up\r\nby a gentle incline! Certainly not! Let him find himself near some very\r\nsteep slope, impossible to climb, and that is the very path which the\r\nobstinate fellow will choose. Now begins a Sisyphean labour. The ball,\r\nthat enormous burden, is painfully hoisted, step by step, with infinite\r\nprecautions, to a certain height, always backwards. We wonder by what\r\nmiracle of statics a mass of this size can be kept upon the slope. Oh!\r\nAn ill-advised movement frustrates all this toil: the ball rolls down,\r\ndragging the Beetle with it. Once more the heights are scaled and\r\nanother fall is the sequel. The attempt is renewed, with greater skill\r\nthis time at the difficult points; a wretched grass-root, the cause of\r\nthe previous falls, is carefully got over. We are almost there; but\r\nsteady now, steady! It is a dangerous ascent and the merest trifle may\r\nyet ruin everything. For see, a leg slips on a smooth bit of gravel!\r\nDown come ball and Beetle, all mixed up together. And the insect begins\r\nover again, with indefatigable obstinacy. Ten times, twenty times, he\r\nwill attempt the hopeless ascent, until his persistence vanquishes all\r\nobstacles, or until, wisely recognizing the futility of his efforts, he\r\nadopts the level road.\r\n\r\nThe Scarab does not always push his precious ball alone: sometimes he\r\ntakes a partner; or, to be accurate, the partner takes him. This is the\r\nway in which things usually happen: once his ball is ready, a\r\nDung-beetle issues from the crowd and leaves the workyard, pushing his\r\nprize backwards. A neighbour, a newcomer, whose own task is hardly\r\nbegun, abruptly drops his work and runs to the moving ball, to lend a\r\nhand to the lucky owner, who seems to accept the proffered aid kindly.\r\nHenceforth the two work in partnership. Each does his best to push the\r\npellet to a place of safety. Was a compact really concluded in the\r\nworkyard, a tacit agreement to share the cake between them? While one\r\nwas kneading and moulding the ball, was the other tapping rich veins\r\nwhence to extract choice materials and add them to the common store? I\r\nhave never observed any such collaboration; I have always seen each\r\nDung-beetle occupied solely with his own affairs in the works. The\r\nlast-comer, therefore, has no acquired rights.\r\n\r\nCan it then be a partnership between the two sexes, a couple intending\r\nto set up house? I thought so for a time. The two Beetles, one before,\r\none behind, pushing the heavy ball with equal fervour, reminded me of a\r\nsong which the hurdy-gurdies used to grind out some years ago:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pour monter notre ménage, hélas! comment ferons-nous?\r\n    Toi devant et moi derrière, nous pousserons le tonneau. [3]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the scalpel compelled me to abandon my belief in this\r\ndomestic idyll. There is no outward difference between the two sexes in\r\nthe Scarabæi. I therefore dissected the pair of Dung-beetles engaged in\r\ntrundling one and the same ball; and they very often proved to be of\r\nthe same sex.\r\n\r\nNeither community of family nor community of labour! Then what is the\r\nmotive for this apparent partnership? It is purely and simply an\r\nattempt at robbery. The zealous fellow-worker, on the false plea of\r\nlending a helping hand, cherishes a plan to purloin the ball at the\r\nfirst opportunity. To make one’s own ball at the heap means hard work\r\nand patience; to steal one ready-made, or at least to foist one’s self\r\nas a guest, is a much easier matter. Should the owner’s vigilance\r\nslacken, you can run away with his property; should you be too closely\r\nwatched, you can sit down to table uninvited, pleading services\r\nrendered. It is ‘Heads I win, tails you lose’ in these tactics, so that\r\npillage is practised as one of the most lucrative of trades. Some go to\r\nwork craftily, in the way which I have described: they come to the aid\r\nof a comrade who has not the least need of them and hide the most\r\nbarefaced greed under the cloak of charitable assistance. Others,\r\nbolder perhaps, more confident in their strength, go straight to their\r\ngoal and commit robbery with violence.\r\n\r\nScenes are constantly happening such as this: a Scarab goes off,\r\npeacefully, by himself, rolling his ball, his lawful property, acquired\r\nby conscientious work. Another comes flying up, I know not whence,\r\ndrops down heavily, folds his dingy wings under their cases and, with\r\nthe back of his toothed fore-arms, knocks over the owner, who is\r\npowerless to ward off the attack in his awkward position, harnessed as\r\nhe is to his property. While the victim struggles to his feet, the\r\nother perches himself atop the ball, the best position from which to\r\nrepel an assailant. With his fore-arms crossed over his breast, ready\r\nto hit back, he awaits events. The dispossessed one moves round the\r\nball, seeking a favourable spot at which to make the assault; the\r\nusurper spins round on the roof of the citadel, facing his opponent all\r\nthe time. If the latter raise himself in order to scale the wall, the\r\nrobber gives him a blow that stretches him on his back. Safe at the top\r\nof his fortress, the besieged Beetle could foil his adversary’s\r\nattempts indefinitely if the latter did not change his tactics. He\r\nturns sapper so as to reduce the citadel with the garrison. The ball,\r\nshaken from below, totters and begins rolling, carrying with it the\r\nthieving Dung-beetle, who makes violent efforts to maintain his\r\nposition on the top. This he succeeds in doing—though not\r\ninvariably—thanks to hurried gymnastic feats which land him higher on\r\nthe ball and make up for the ground which he loses by its rotation.\r\nShould a false movement bring him to earth, the chances become equal\r\nand the struggle turns into a wrestling-match. Robber and robbed\r\ngrapple with each other, breast to breast. Their legs lock and unlock,\r\ntheir joints intertwine, their horny armour clashes and grates with the\r\nrasping sound of metal under the file. Then the one who succeeds in\r\nthrowing his opponent and releasing himself scrambles to the top of the\r\nball and there takes up his position. The siege is renewed, now by the\r\nrobber, now by the robbed, as the chances of the hand-to-hand conflict\r\nmay decree. The former, a brawny desperado, no novice at the game,\r\noften has the best of the fight. Then, after two or three unsuccessful\r\nattempts, the defeated Beetle wearies and returns philosophically to\r\nthe heap, to make himself a new pellet. As for the other, with all fear\r\nof a surprise attack at an end, he harnesses himself to the conquered\r\nball and pushes it whither he pleases. I have sometimes seen a third\r\nthief appear upon the scene and rob the robber. Nor can I honestly say\r\nthat I was sorry.\r\n\r\nI ask myself in vain what Proudhon [4] introduced into Scarabæan\r\nmorality the daring paradox that ‘property means plunder,’ or what\r\ndiplomatist taught the Dung-beetle the savage maxim that ‘might is\r\nright.’ I have no data that would enable me to trace the origin of\r\nthese spoliations, which have become a custom, of this abuse of\r\nstrength to capture a lump of ordure. All that I can say is that theft\r\nis a general practice among the Scarabs. These dung-rollers rob one\r\nanother with a calm effrontery which, to my knowledge, is without a\r\nparallel. I leave it to future observers to elucidate this curious\r\nproblem in animal psychology and I go back to the two partners rolling\r\ntheir ball in concert.\r\n\r\nBut first let me dispel a current error in the text-books. I find in M.\r\nÉmile Blanchard’s [5] magnificent work, Métamorphoses, mœurs et\r\ninstincts des insectes, the following passage:\r\n\r\n\r\n   ‘Sometimes our insect is stopped by an insurmountable obstacle; the\r\n    ball has fallen into a hole. At such moments the Ateuchus [6] gives\r\n    evidence of a really astonishing grasp of the situation as well as\r\n    of a system of ready communication between individuals of the same\r\n    species which is even more remarkable. Recognizing the\r\n    impossibility of coaxing the ball out of the hole, the Ateuchus\r\n    seems to abandon it and flies away. If you are sufficiently endowed\r\n    with that great and noble virtue called patience, stay by the\r\n    forsaken ball: after a while, the Ateuchus will return to the same\r\n    spot and will not return alone; he will be accompanied by two,\r\n    three, four or five companions, who will all alight at the place\r\n    indicated and will combine their efforts to raise the load. The\r\n    Ateuchus has been to fetch reinforcements; and this explains why it\r\n    is such a common sight, in the dry fields, to see several Ateuchi\r\n    joining in the removal of a single ball.’\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, I read in Illiger’s [7] Entomological Magazine:\r\n\r\n\r\n   ‘A Gymnopleurus pilularius, [8] while constructing the ball of dung\r\n    destined to contain her eggs, let it roll into a hole, whence she\r\n    strove for a long time to extract it unaided. Finding that she was\r\n    wasting her time in vain efforts, she ran to a neighbouring heap of\r\n    manure to fetch three individuals of her own species, who, uniting\r\n    their strength to hers, succeeded in withdrawing the ball from the\r\n    cavity into which it had fallen and then returned to their manure\r\n    to continue their work.’\r\n\r\n\r\nI crave a thousand pardons of my illustrious master, M. Blanchard, but\r\nthings certainly do not happen as he says. To begin with, the two\r\naccounts are so much alike that they must have had a common origin.\r\nIlliger, on the strength of observations not continuous enough to\r\ndeserve blind confidence, put forward the case of his Gymnopleurus; and\r\nthe same story was repeated about the Scarabæi because it is, in fact,\r\nquite usual to see two of these insects occupied together either in\r\nrolling a ball or in getting it out of a troublesome place. But this\r\ncooperation in no way proves that the Dung-beetle who found himself in\r\ndifficulties went to requisition the aid of his mates. I have had no\r\nsmall measure of the patience recommended by M. Blanchard; I have lived\r\nlaborious days in close intimacy, if I may say so, with the Sacred\r\nBeetle; I have done everything that I could think of in order to enter\r\nas thoroughly as possible into his ways and habits and to study them\r\nfrom life; and I have never seen anything that suggested either nearly\r\nor remotely the idea of companions summoned to lend assistance. As I\r\nshall presently relate, I have subjected the Dung-beetle to far more\r\nserious trials than that of getting his ball into a hole; I have\r\nconfronted him with much graver difficulties than that of mounting a\r\nslope, which is sheer sport to the obstinate Sisyphus, who seems to\r\ndelight in the rough gymnastics involved in climbing steep places, as\r\nif the ball thereby grew firmer and accordingly increased in value; I\r\nhave created artificial situations in which the insect had the\r\nuttermost need of help; and never did my eyes detect any evidence of\r\nfriendly services rendered by comrade to comrade. I have seen Beetles\r\nrobbed and Beetles robbing and nothing more. If a number of them were\r\ngathered around the same pill, it meant that a battle was taking place.\r\nMy humble opinion, therefore, is that the incident of a number of\r\nScarabæi collected around the same ball with thieving intentions has\r\ngiven rise to these stories of comrades called in to lend a hand.\r\nImperfect observations are responsible for this transformation of the\r\nbold highwayman into a helpful companion who has left his work to do\r\nanother a friendly turn.\r\n\r\nIt is no light matter to attribute to an insect a really astonishing\r\ngrasp of a situation, combined with an even more amazing power of\r\ncommunication between individuals of the same species. Such an\r\nadmission involves more than one imagines. That is why I insist on my\r\npoint. What! Are we to believe that a Beetle in distress will conceive\r\nthe idea of going in quest of help? We are to imagine him flying off\r\nand scouring the country to find fellow-workers on some patch of dung;\r\nwhen he has found them, we are to suppose that he addresses them, in a\r\nsort of pantomime, by gestures with his antennæ more particularly, in\r\nsome such words as these:\r\n\r\n‘I say, you fellows, my load’s upset in a hole over there; come and\r\nhelp me get it out. I’ll do as much for you one day!’\r\n\r\nAnd we are to believe that his comrades understand! And, more\r\nincredible still, that they straightway leave their work, the pellet\r\nwhich they have just begun, the beloved pill exposed to the cupidity of\r\nothers and certain to be filched in their absence, and go to the help\r\nof the suppliant! I am profoundly incredulous of such unselfishness;\r\nand my incredulity is confirmed by what I have witnessed for years and\r\nyears, not in glass-cases but in the very places where the Scarab\r\nworks. Apart from its maternal solicitude, in which respect it is\r\nnearly always admirable, the insect cares for nothing but itself,\r\nunless it lives in societies, like the Hive-bees, the Ants and the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nBut let me end this digression, which is excused by the importance of\r\nthe subject. I was saying that a Sacred Beetle, in possession of a ball\r\nwhich he is pushing backwards, is often joined by another, who comes\r\nhurrying up to lend an assistance which is anything but disinterested,\r\nhis intention being to rob his companion if the opportunity present\r\nitself. Let us call the two workers partners, though that is not the\r\nproper name for them, seeing that the one forces himself upon the\r\nother, who probably accepts outside help only for fear of a worse evil.\r\nThe meeting, by the way, is absolutely peaceful. The owner of the ball\r\ndoes not cease work for an instant on the arrival of the newcomer; and\r\nhis uninvited assistant seems animated by the best intentions and sets\r\nto work on the spot. The way in which the two partners harness\r\nthemselves differs. The proprietor occupies the chief position, the\r\nplace of honour: he pushes at the rear, with his hind-legs in the air\r\nand his head down. His subordinate is in front, in the reverse posture,\r\nhead up, toothed arms on the ball, long hind-legs on the ground.\r\nBetween the two, the ball rolls along, one driving it before him, the\r\nother pulling it towards him.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the couple are not always very harmonious, the more so\r\nas the assistant has his back to the road to be traversed, while the\r\nowner’s view is impeded by the load. The result is that they are\r\nconstantly having accidents, absurd tumbles, taken cheerfully and in\r\ngood part: each picks himself up quickly and resumes the same position\r\nas before. On level ground this system of traction does not correspond\r\nwith the dynamic force expended, through lack of precision in the\r\ncombined movements: the Scarab at the back would do as well and better\r\nif left to himself. And so the helper, having given a proof of his\r\ngood-will at the risk of throwing the machinery out of gear, now\r\ndecides to keep still, without letting go of the precious ball, of\r\ncourse. He already looks upon that as his: a ball touched is a ball\r\ngained. He won’t be so silly as not to stick to it: the other might\r\ngive him the slip!\r\n\r\nSo he gathers his legs flat under his belly, encrusting himself, so to\r\nspeak, on the ball and becoming one with it. Henceforth, the whole\r\nconcern—the ball and the Beetle clinging to its surface—is rolled along\r\nby the efforts of the lawful owner. The intruder sits tight and lies\r\nlow, heedless whether the load pass over his body, whether he be at the\r\ntop, bottom or side of the rolling ball. A queer sort of assistant, who\r\ngets a free ride so as to make sure of his share of the victuals!\r\n\r\nBut a steep ascent heaves in sight and gives him a fine part to play.\r\nHe takes the lead now, holding up the heavy mass with his toothed arms,\r\nwhile his mate seeks a purchase in order to hoist the load a little\r\nhigher. In this way, by a combination of well-directed efforts, the\r\nBeetle above gripping, the one below pushing, I have seen a couple\r\nmount hills which would have been too much for a single carter, however\r\npersevering. But in times of difficulty not all show the same zeal:\r\nthere are some who, on awkward slopes where their assistance is most\r\nneeded, seem blissfully unaware of the trouble. While the unhappy\r\nSisyphus exhausts himself in attempts to get over the bad part, the\r\nother quietly leaves him to it: imbedded in the ball, he rolls down\r\nwith it if it comes to grief and is hoisted up with it when they start\r\nafresh.\r\n\r\nI have often tried the following experiment on the two partners in\r\norder to judge their inventive faculties when placed in a serious\r\npredicament. Suppose them to be on level ground, number two seated\r\nmotionless on the ball, number one busy pushing. Without disturbing the\r\nlatter, I nail the ball to the ground with a long, strong pin. It stops\r\nsuddenly. The Beetle, unaware of my perfidy, doubtless believes that\r\nsome natural obstacle, a rut, a tuft of couch-grass, a pebble, bars the\r\nway. He redoubles his efforts, struggles his hardest; nothing happens.\r\n\r\n‘What can the matter be? Let’s go and see.’\r\n\r\nThe Beetle walks two or three times round his pellet. Discovering\r\nnothing to account for its immobility, he returns to the rear and\r\nstarts pushing again. The ball remains stationary.\r\n\r\n‘Let’s look up above.’\r\n\r\nThe Beetle goes up, to find nothing but his motionless colleague, for I\r\nhad taken care to drive in the pin so deep that the head disappeared in\r\nthe ball. He explores the whole upper surface and comes down again.\r\nFresh thrusts are vigorously applied in front and at the sides, with\r\nthe same absence of success. There is not a doubt about it: never\r\nbefore was Dung-beetle confronted with such a problem in inertia.\r\n\r\nNow is the time, the very time, to claim assistance, which is all the\r\neasier as his mate is there, close at hand, squatting on the summit of\r\nthe ball. Will the Scarab rouse him? Will he talk to him like this:\r\n\r\n‘What are you doing there, lazybones? Come and look at the thing: it’s\r\nbroken down!’\r\n\r\nNothing proves that he does anything of the kind, for I see him\r\nsteadily shaking the unshakable, inspecting his stationary machine on\r\nevery side, while all this time his companion sits resting. At long\r\nlast, however, the latter becomes aware that something unusual is\r\nhappening; he is apprised of it by his mate’s restless tramping and by\r\nthe immobility of the ball. He comes down, therefore, and in his turn\r\nexamines the machine. Double harness does no better than single\r\nharness. This is beginning to look serious. The little fans of the\r\nBeetles’ antennæ open and shut, open again, betraying by their\r\nagitation acute anxiety. Then a stroke of genius ends the perplexity:\r\n\r\n‘Who knows what’s underneath?’\r\n\r\nThey now start exploring below the ball; and a little digging soon\r\nreveals the presence of the pin. They recognize at once that the\r\ntrouble is there.\r\n\r\nIf I had had a voice in their deliberations, I should have said:\r\n\r\n‘We must make a hole in the ball and pull out that skewer which is\r\nholding it down.’\r\n\r\nThis most elementary of all proceedings and one so easy to such expert\r\ndiggers was not adopted, was not even tried. The Dung-beetle was\r\nshrewder than man. The two colleagues, one on this side, one on that,\r\nslip under the ball, which begins to slide up the pin, getting higher\r\nand higher in proportion as the living wedges make their way\r\nunderneath. The clever operation is made possible by the softness of\r\nthe material, which gives easily and makes a channel under the head of\r\nthe immovable stake. Soon the pellet is suspended at a height equal to\r\nthe thickness of the Scarabs’ bodies. The rest is not such plain\r\nsailing. The Dung-beetles, who at first were lying flat, rise gradually\r\nto their feet, still pushing with their backs. The work becomes harder\r\nand harder as the legs, in straightening out, lose their strength; but\r\nnone the less they do it. Then comes a time when they can no longer\r\npush with their backs, the limit of their height having been reached. A\r\nlast resource remains, but one much less favourable to the development\r\nof motive power. This is for the insect to adopt one or other of its\r\npostures when harnessed to the ball, head down or up, and to push with\r\nits hind- or fore-legs, as the case may be. Finally the ball drops to\r\nthe ground, unless we have used too long a pin. The gash made by our\r\nstake is repaired, more or less, and the carting of the precious pellet\r\nis at once resumed.\r\n\r\nBut, should the pin really be too long, then the ball, which remains\r\nfirmly fixed, ends by being suspended at a height above that of the\r\ninsect’s full stature. In that case, after vain evolutions around the\r\nunconquerable greased pole, the Dung-beetles throw up the sponge,\r\nunless we are sufficiently kind-hearted to finish the work ourselves\r\nand restore their treasure to them. Or again we can help them by\r\nraising the floor with a small flat stone, a pedestal from the top of\r\nwhich it is possible for the Beetle to continue his labours. Its use\r\ndoes not appear to be immediately understood, for neither of the two is\r\nin any hurry to take advantage of it. Nevertheless, by accident or\r\ndesign, one or other at last finds himself on the stone. Oh, joy! As he\r\npassed, he felt the ball touch his back. At that contact, courage\r\nreturns; and his efforts begin once more. Standing on his helpful\r\nplatform, the Scarab stretches his joints, rounds his shoulders, as one\r\nmight say, and shoves the pellet upwards. When his shoulders no longer\r\navail, he works with his legs, now upright, now head downwards. There\r\nis a fresh pause, accompanied by fresh signs of uneasiness, when the\r\nlimit of extension is reached. Thereupon, without disturbing the\r\ncreature, we place a second little stone on the top of the first. With\r\nthe aid of this new step, which provides a fulcrum for its levers, the\r\ninsect pursues its task. Thus adding story upon story as required, I\r\nhave seen the Scarab, hoisted to the summit of a tottering pile three\r\nor four fingers’-breadth in height, persevere in his work until the\r\nball was completely detached.\r\n\r\nHad he some vague consciousness of the service performed by the gradual\r\nraising of the pedestal? I venture to doubt it, though he cleverly took\r\nadvantage of my platform of little stones. As a matter of fact, if the\r\nvery elementary idea of using a higher support in order to reach\r\nsomething placed above one’s grasp were not beyond the Beetle’s\r\ncomprehension, how is it that, when there are two of them, neither\r\nthinks of lending the other his back so as to raise him by that much\r\nand make it possible for him to go on working? If one helped the other\r\nin this way, they could reach twice as high. They are very far,\r\nhowever, from any such cooperation. Each pushes the ball, with all his\r\nmight, I admit, but he pushes as if he were alone and seems to have no\r\nnotion of the happy result that would follow a combined effort. In this\r\ninstance, when the ball is nailed to the ground by a pin, they do\r\nexactly what they do in corresponding circumstances, as, for example,\r\nwhen the load is brought to a standstill by some obstacle, caught in a\r\nloop of couch-grass or transfixed by some spiky bit of stalk that has\r\nrun into the soft, rolling mass. I produced artificially a stoppage\r\nwhich is not really very different from those occurring naturally when\r\nthe ball is being rolled amid the thousand and one irregularities of\r\nthe ground; and the Beetle behaves, in my experimental tests, as he\r\nwould have behaved in any other circumstances in which I had no part.\r\nHe uses his back as a wedge and a lever and pushes with his feet,\r\nwithout introducing anything new into his methods, even when he has a\r\ncompanion and can avail himself of his assistance.\r\n\r\nWhen he is all alone in face of the difficulty, when he has no\r\nassistant, his dynamic operations remain absolutely the same; and his\r\nefforts to move his transfixed ball end in success, provided that we\r\ngive him the indispensable support of a platform, built up little by\r\nlittle. If we deny him this succour, then, no longer encouraged by the\r\ncontact of his beloved ball, he loses heart and sooner or later flies\r\naway, doubtless with many regrets, and disappears. Where to? I do not\r\nknow. What I do know is that he does not return with a gang of\r\nfellow-labourers whom he has begged to help him. What would he do with\r\nthem, he who cannot make use of even one comrade?\r\n\r\nBut perhaps my experiment, which leaves the ball suspended at an\r\ninaccessible height and the insect with its means of action exhausted,\r\nis a little too far removed from ordinary conditions. Let us try\r\ninstead a miniature pit, deep enough and steep enough to prevent the\r\nDung-beetle, when placed at the bottom, from rolling his load up the\r\nside. These are exactly the conditions stated by Messrs. Blanchard and\r\nIlliger. Well, what happens? When dogged but utterly fruitless efforts\r\nhave convinced him of his helplessness, the Beetle takes wing and\r\ndisappears. Relying upon what these learned writers said, I have waited\r\nlong hours for the insect to return reinforced by a few friends. I have\r\nalways waited in vain. Many a time also I have found the pellet several\r\ndays later just where I left it, stuck at the top of a pin or in a\r\nhole, proving that nothing fresh had happened in my absence. A ball\r\nabandoned from necessity is a ball abandoned for good, with no attempt\r\nat salvage with the aid of others. A dexterous use of wedge and lever\r\nto set the ball rolling again is therefore, when all is said, the\r\ngreatest intellectual effort which I have observed in the Sacred\r\nBeetle. To make up for what the experiment refutes, namely, an appeal\r\nfor help among fellow-workers, I gladly chronicle this feat of\r\nmechanical prowess for the Dung-beetles’ greater glory.\r\n\r\nDirecting their steps at random, over sandy plains thick with thyme,\r\nover cart-ruts and steep places, the two Beetle brethren roll the ball\r\nalong for some time, thus giving its substance a certain consistency\r\nwhich may be to their liking. While still on the road, they select a\r\nfavourable spot. The rightful owner, the Beetle who throughout has kept\r\nthe place of honour, behind the ball, the one in short who has done\r\nalmost all the carting by himself, sets to work to dig the dining-room.\r\nBeside him is the ball, with number two clinging to it, shamming dead.\r\nNumber one attacks the sand with his sharp-edged forehead and his\r\ntoothed legs; he flings armfuls of it behind him; and the work of\r\nexcavating proceeds apace. Soon the Beetle has disappeared from view in\r\nthe half-dug cavern. Whenever he returns to the upper air with a load,\r\nhe invariably glances at his ball to see if all is well. From time to\r\ntime he brings it nearer the threshold of the burrow; he feels it and\r\nseems to acquire new vigour from the contact. The other, lying demure\r\nand motionless on the ball, continues to inspire confidence. Meanwhile\r\nthe underground hall grows larger and deeper; and the digger’s field of\r\noperations is now too vast for any but very occasional appearances. Now\r\nis the time. The crafty sleeper awakens and hurriedly decamps with the\r\nball, which he pushes behind him with the speed of a pickpocket anxious\r\nnot to be caught in the act. This breach of trust rouses my\r\nindignation, but the historian triumphs for the moment over the\r\nmoralist and I leave him alone: I shall have time enough to intervene\r\non the side of law and order if things threaten to turn out badly.\r\n\r\nThe thief is already some yards away. His victim comes out of the\r\nburrow, looks around and finds nothing. Doubtless an old hand himself,\r\nhe knows what this means. Scent and sight soon put him on the track. He\r\nmakes haste and catches up the robber; but the artful dodger, when he\r\nfeels his pursuer close on his heels, promptly changes his posture,\r\ngets on his hind-legs and clasps the ball with his toothed arms, as he\r\ndoes when acting as an assistant.\r\n\r\nYou rogue, you! I see through your tricks: you mean to plead as an\r\nexcuse that the pellet rolled down the slope and that you are only\r\ntrying to stop it and bring it back home. I, however, an impartial\r\nwitness, declare that the ball was quite steady at the entrance to the\r\nburrow and did not roll of its own accord. Besides, the ground is\r\nlevel. I declare that I saw you set the thing in motion and make off\r\nwith unmistakable intentions. It was an attempt at larceny, or I’ve\r\nnever seen one!\r\n\r\nMy evidence is not admitted. The owner cheerfully accepts the other’s\r\nexcuses; and the two bring the ball back to the burrow as though\r\nnothing had happened.\r\n\r\nIf the thief, however, has time to get far enough away, or if he\r\nmanages to cover his trail by adroitly doubling back, the injury is\r\nirreparable. To collect provisions under a blazing sun, to cart them a\r\nlong distance, to dig a comfortable banqueting-hall in the sand, and\r\nthen—just when everything is ready and your appetite, whetted by\r\nexercise, lends an added charm to the approaching feast—suddenly to\r\nfind yourself cheated by a crafty partner is, it must be admitted, a\r\nreverse of fortune that would dishearten most of us. The Dung-beetle\r\ndoes not allow himself to be cast down by this piece of ill-luck: he\r\nrubs his cheeks, spreads his antennæ, sniffs the air and flies to the\r\nnearest heap to begin all over again. I admire and envy this cast of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nSuppose the Scarab fortunate enough to have found a loyal partner; or,\r\nbetter still, suppose that he has met no self-incited companion. The\r\nburrow is ready. It is a shallow cavity, about the size of one’s fist,\r\ndug in soft earth, usually in sand, and communicating with the outside\r\nby a short passage just wide enough to admit the ball. As soon as the\r\nprovisions are safely stored away, the Scarab shuts himself in by\r\nstopping up the entrance to his dwelling with rubbish kept in a corner\r\nfor the purpose. Once the door is closed, nothing outside betrays the\r\nexistence of the banqueting-chamber. And, now, hail mirth and jollity!\r\nAll is for the best in the best of all possible worlds! The table is\r\nsumptuously spread; the ceiling tempers the heat of the sun and allows\r\nonly a moist and gentle warmth to penetrate; the undisturbed quiet, the\r\ndarkness, the Crickets’ concert overhead are all pleasant aids to\r\ndigestion. So complete has been the illusion that I have caught myself\r\nlistening at the door, expecting to hear the revellers burst into the\r\nfamous snatch in Galatée: [9]\r\n\r\n\r\n            Ah! qu’il est doux de ne rien faire,\r\n            Quand tout s’agite autour de nous? [10]\r\n\r\n\r\nWho would dare disturb the bliss of such a banquet? But the desire for\r\nknowledge is capable of all things; and I had the necessary daring. I\r\nwill set down here the result of my violation of the home.\r\n\r\nThe ball by itself fills almost the whole room; the rich repast rises\r\nfrom floor to ceiling. A narrow passage runs between it and the walls.\r\nHere sit the banqueters, two at most, very often only one, belly to\r\ntable, back to the wall. Once the seat is chosen, no one stirs; all the\r\nvital forces are absorbed by the digestive faculties. There is no\r\nfidgeting, which might mean the loss of a mouthful; no dainty toying\r\nwith the food, which might cause some to be wasted. Everything has to\r\npass through, properly and in order. To see them seated so solemnly\r\naround a ball of dung, one would think that they were conscious of\r\ntheir function as cleansers of the earth and that they were\r\ndeliberately devoting themselves to that marvellous chemistry which out\r\nof filth brings forth the flower that delights our eyes and the\r\nBeetles’ wing-case that jewels our lawns in spring. For this supreme\r\nwork which turns into living matter the refuse which neither the Horse\r\nnor the Mule can utilize, despite the perfection of their digestive\r\norgans, the Dung-beetle must needs be specially equipped. And indeed\r\nanatomy compels us to admire the prodigious length of his coiled\r\nintestine, which slowly elaborates the materials in its manifold\r\nwindings and exhausts them to the very last serviceable atom. Matter\r\nfrom which the ruminant’s stomach could extract nothing, yields to this\r\npowerful alembic riches that, at a mere touch, are transmuted into ebon\r\nmail in the Sacred Scarab and a breastplate of gold and rubies in other\r\nDung-beetles.\r\n\r\nNow this wonderful metamorphosis of ordure has to be accomplished in\r\nthe shortest possible time: the public health demands it. And so the\r\nScarab is endowed with matchless digestive powers. Once housed in the\r\ncompany of food, he goes on eating and digesting, day and night, until\r\nthe provisions are exhausted. There is no difficulty in proving this.\r\nOpen the cell to which the Dung-beetle has retired from the world. At\r\nany hour of the day, we shall find the insect seated at table and,\r\nbehind it, still hanging to it, a continuous cord, roughly coiled like\r\na pile of cables. One can easily guess, without embarrassing\r\nexplanations, what this cord represents. The great ball of dung passes\r\nmouthful by mouthful through the Beetle’s digestive canals, yielding up\r\nits nutritive essences, and reappears at the opposite end spun into a\r\ncord. Well, this unbroken cord, which is always found hanging from the\r\naperture of the draw-plate, is ample proof, without further evidence,\r\nthat the digestive processes go on without ceasing. When the provisions\r\nare coming to an end, the cable unrolled is of an astounding length: it\r\ncan be measured in feet. Where shall we find the like of this stomach\r\nwhich, to avoid any loss when life’s balance-sheet is made out, feasts\r\nfor a week or a fortnight, without stopping, on such distasteful fare?\r\n\r\nWhen the whole ball has passed through the machine, the hermit comes\r\nback to the daylight, tries his luck afresh, finds another patch of\r\ndung, fashions a new ball and starts eating again. This life of\r\npleasure lasts for a month or two, from May to June; then, with the\r\ncoming of the fierce heat beloved of the Cicadæ, [11] the Sacred\r\nBeetles take up their summer quarters and bury themselves in the cool\r\nearth. They reappear with the first autumn rains, less numerous and\r\nless active than in spring, but now seemingly absorbed in the most\r\nimportant work of all, the future of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED BEETLE IN CAPTIVITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we ransack the books for information about the habits of the\r\ndung-rollers in general and the Sacred Beetle in particular, we find\r\nthat modern science still clings to some of the beliefs which were\r\ncurrent in the days of the Pharaohs. We are told that the ball which is\r\nbumped across the fields contains an egg, that it is a cradle in which\r\nthe future larva is to find both board and lodging. The parents roll it\r\nover hilly country to make it nice and round; and, when jolts and jars\r\nand tumbles down steep places have shaped it properly, they bury it and\r\nabandon it to the care of that great incubator, the earth.\r\n\r\nSo rough an upbringing has always seemed to me improbable. How could a\r\nBeetle’s egg, that delicate thing, so sensitive under its soft wrapper,\r\nsurvive the shaking-up which it would undergo in that rolling cradle?\r\nIn the germ is a spark of life which the least touch, the veriest\r\ntrifle can extinguish. Are we to believe that the parents would\r\ndeliberately bump it over hill and dale for hours? No, that is not the\r\nway in which things happen; a mother does not subject her offspring to\r\nthe torture of a Regulus’ barrel.\r\n\r\nHowever, something more than logic was needed to make a clean sweep of\r\naccepted opinion. I therefore opened some hundreds of the pellets that\r\nwere being rolled along by the Dung-beetles; I opened others which I\r\ntook from holes dug before my eyes; and never once did I find either a\r\ncentral cell or an egg in those pellets. They were invariably rough\r\nlumps of food, fashioned in haste, with no definite internal structure,\r\nmerely so much provender with which the Beetle retires to spend a few\r\ndays in undisturbed gluttony. The dung-rollers covet and steal them\r\nfrom one another with a keenness which they would certainly not display\r\nin robbing one another of new family charges. For Sacred Beetles to go\r\nstealing eggs would be an absurdity, each of them having quite enough\r\nto do in securing the future of her own. So this point is henceforward\r\nsettled beyond question: the pellets which we see the Dung-beetles\r\nrolling never contain eggs.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt to solve the knotty problem of the larva’s rearing\r\ninvolved the construction of a spacious vivarium, with an artificial\r\nsoil of sand and a constant supply of provisions. Into this cage I put\r\nsome twenty Sacred Beetles, together with Copres, Gymnopleuri and\r\nOnthophagi. No entomological experiment ever cost me so many\r\ndisappointments. The difficulty was the renewing of the food supply.\r\nNow my landlord owned a stable and a Horse. I gained the confidence of\r\nhis man, who at first laughed at my proposals, but soon allowed himself\r\nto be convinced by the sight of silver. Each of my insects’ breakfasts\r\ncame to twenty-five centimes. I am sure that no Beetle budget ever\r\namounted to such a sum before. Well, I can still see and I shall always\r\nsee Joseph, after grooming the Horse of a morning, put his head over\r\nthe garden-wall and, making a speaking-trumpet of his hand, call ‘Hi!’\r\nto me in a whisper. I would hurry up to receive a potful of droppings.\r\nCaution was necessary on both sides, as the sequel will show you. One\r\nday the master happened to come up just when the transfer was being\r\nmade, and took it into his head that all his manure was going over the\r\nwall and that what he wanted for his cabbages went to grow my verbenas\r\nand narcissi. Vainly I tried to explain: he thought that I was being\r\nfunny. Poor Joseph was scolded, called all manner of names and\r\nthreatened with dismissal if it happened again. It didn’t.\r\n\r\nI had one resource left, which was to go ignominiously along the\r\nhigh-road and furtively collect my captives’ daily bread in a paper\r\nbag. This I did and I am not ashamed of it. Sometimes fortune favoured\r\nme: a Donkey carrying the produce of the Château-Renard or Barbentane\r\nkitchen-gardens to the Avignon market would drop his contribution as he\r\npassed my door. The gratuity, picked up instantly, made me rich for\r\nseveral days. In short, by scheming, waiting, running about and playing\r\nthe diplomat for a blob of dung, I managed to feed my prisoners. If a\r\npassion for one’s work and a love which nothing can discourage ensure\r\nsuccess, my experiment ought to have succeeded. It did not succeed.\r\nAfter a time, my Sacred Beetles, pining for their native heath in a\r\nspace too limited for their elaborate evolutions, died miserable\r\ndeaths, without revealing their secrets. The Gymnopleuri and Onthophagi\r\nwere not so disappointing. At the proper time I shall make use of the\r\ninformation which I obtained from them.\r\n\r\nTogether with my attempts at home breeding I carried on my direct\r\ninvestigations abroad. The results fell far short of my wishes. One day\r\nI decided that I must enlist outside help. As it happened, a merry band\r\nof youngsters was crossing the plateau. It was a Thursday. [12]\r\nUntroubled by thoughts of school and horrid lessons, they were coming\r\nfrom the neighbouring village of Les Angles, with an apple in one hand\r\nand a piece of bread in the other, and wending their way to the bare\r\nhill yonder, where the bullets bury themselves harmlessly when the\r\ngarrison is at rifle-practice. The object of this early morning\r\nexpedition was the unearthing of a few bits of lead, worth perhaps a\r\nhalfpenny the lot. The small pink blossoms of the wild geranium decked\r\nthe scanty patches of grass which for a brief moment beautified this\r\nArabia Petræa; the Wheat-ear, in his black-and-white motley, twittered\r\nas he flew from one rocky point to another; on the threshold of burrows\r\ndug at the foot of the thyme-tufts, the Crickets were filling the air\r\nwith their droning symphony. And the children were rejoicing in this\r\nspringtide happiness and rejoicing still more in the prospect of\r\nwealth, the halfpenny which they would receive for such bullets as they\r\nfound, the halfpenny which would enable them to buy two peppermint\r\nbull’s-eyes next Sunday, two of the big ones, at a farthing apiece,\r\nfrom the woman at the stall outside the church.\r\n\r\nI accost the tallest, whose sharp face gives me some hope of him; the\r\nlittle ones stand round, eating their apples. I explain what I want and\r\nshow them the Sacred Beetle rolling his ball; I tell them that in some\r\nsuch ball, hidden somewhere or other underground, there is occasionally\r\na little hollow place and in that hollow a little worm. The thing to do\r\nis to dig around at random, keeping an eye on what the Beetles are\r\ndoing, and to find the ball containing the worm. Balls without a worm\r\ndon’t count. And, to tempt them with a fabulous sum which shall divert\r\nto my purposes the time hitherto devoted to a few farthings’ worth of\r\nlead, I promise to pay a franc, a shiny new twenty-sou piece, for each\r\noccupied ball. At the mention of this sum, those adorably innocent eyes\r\nopen their widest. I have upset all their ideas of finance by naming\r\nthis fanciful price. Then, to show that my proposal is serious, I\r\ndistribute a few sous as earnest-money. I arrange to be there next\r\nweek, on the same day and at the same time, and faithfully to perform\r\nmy part of the bargain towards all those who have made the lucky find.\r\nAfter carefully posting the party in their duties, I dismiss them.\r\n\r\n‘He means it!’ the children said, as they went away. ‘He really means\r\nit! If only we could make a franc apiece!’\r\n\r\nAnd their hearts swelling with fond hopes, they clinked the sous in\r\ntheir hands. The flattened bullets were forgotten. I saw the children\r\nscatter over the plain and begin their search.\r\n\r\nOn the appointed day, a week later, I returned to the plateau. I was\r\nconfident of success. My young helpers were sure to have spoken to\r\ntheir playmates of this lucrative trade in Beetle-balls and convinced\r\nthe incredulous by displaying their earnest-money. And indeed I found a\r\nlarger party than the first time awaiting me on the spot. They came\r\nrunning to meet me, but there was no burst of triumph, no shout of joy.\r\nI suspected at once that things were going badly; and my suspicions\r\nwere but too well-founded. Many times, after coming out of school, they\r\nhad hunted for what I had described, but they had never discovered\r\nanything like it. They handed me a few pellets found underground with\r\nthe Beetle, but these were simply masses of provisions, containing no\r\nlarva. I explained matters anew and made another appointment for the\r\nfollowing Thursday. Again the search was unsuccessful. The disheartened\r\nlittle hunters were now reduced to quite a small number. I made a final\r\nappeal to their sportsmanship and perseverance; but nothing came of it.\r\nAnd I ended by compensating the most industrious, those who had held\r\nout to the last, and cancelling the bargain. I had to conduct my own\r\nresearches, which, though apparently very simple, were in reality\r\nextremely difficult.\r\n\r\nMany years have passed since then, but even to-day I am without any\r\ndefinite, consistent result after all my digging and exploring, though\r\nI have made my examinations at the most likely spots and have carefully\r\nwatched for favourable opportunities. I am reduced to piecing together\r\nmy incomplete observations and filling up the gaps by analogy. [13] The\r\nlittle that I have seen, combined with my study of other Dung-beetles\r\nin captivity—Gymnopleuri, Copres and Onthophagi—is summed up in what\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nThe ball which is destined to contain the egg is not made in public, in\r\nthe hurry and confusion of the dung-yard. It is a work of art and\r\nsupreme patience, demanding concentration and scrupulous care, both\r\nalike impossible in the thick of the crowd. One needs solitude in order\r\nto think out a plan of operations and set to work. So the mother digs\r\nin the sand a burrow four to eight inches deep. It is a rather spacious\r\nhall communicating with the outer world by a much narrower passage. The\r\ninsect brings into it carefully selected materials, doubtless in\r\nspherical form. There must be many journeys, for towards the end of the\r\nwork the contents of the cell are out of all proportion to the size of\r\nthe entrance-door and could not be stored at one attempt. I remember a\r\nSpanish Copris who, at the time of my inspection, was finishing a ball\r\nas big as an orange at the far end of a burrow whose only communication\r\nwith the outside was by means of a gallery into which I was just able\r\nto insert my finger. It is true that the Copres do not roll pills and\r\ndo not travel long distances to fetch food home. They dig a hole\r\nimmediately under the dung and drag the material backwards, armful by\r\narmful, to the bottom of their well. They have thus no difficulty in\r\nprovisioning their houses; moreover, they work in security under the\r\nshelter of the manure: two conditions that promote luxurious tastes.\r\nThe Dung-beetles that follow the humble trade of pill-rollers are less\r\nextravagant; and yet, if he cares to make two or three journeys, the\r\nSacred Beetle can amass wealth of which the Spanish Copris might well\r\nbe jealous.\r\n\r\nSo far, the Beetle has only raw material, lumped together anyhow. A\r\nminute sorting has to take place before anything else is done: this\r\nstuff, the purest, is for the inner layer on which the grub will feed;\r\nthat other, coarser stuff is for the outer layers, which are not meant\r\nfor food and serve only as a protecting shell. Then, around a central\r\nhollow which receives the egg, the materials must be arranged in\r\nsuccessive strata, according as they are less refined and less\r\nnutritive; the layers must possess a proper consistency and must be\r\nmade to adhere to one another; last of all, the stringy parts of the\r\nouter layers, which have to protect the whole structure, must be felted\r\ntogether. How does the clumsy Sacred Beetle, who is so stiff in her\r\nmovements, accomplish a work of this kind in complete darkness, at the\r\nbottom of a hole crammed with provisions and hardly leaving room to\r\nstir? When I consider the delicacy of the workmanship and then the\r\nrough tools of the worker—angular limbs capable of cutting into hard or\r\neven rocky soil—I think of an Elephant trying to make lace. Let whoso\r\ncan explain this miracle of maternal industry; as for me, I give it up,\r\nall the more as I have not had the luck to see the artist at work. We\r\nwill confine ourselves to describing her masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe ball containing the egg is usually the size of an average apple. In\r\nthe centre is an oval hollow about two-fifths of an inch in diameter.\r\nThe egg is fixed at the bottom, standing perpendicularly; it is\r\ncylindrical, rounded at both ends, yellowish-white and about as large\r\nas a grain of wheat, but shorter. The inside of the niche is coated\r\nwith a shiny, greenish-brown, semifluid material, a real stercoral\r\ncream, destined to form the larva’s first mouthfuls. To make this\r\ndainty food, does the mother collect the quintessence of the dung? The\r\nappearance of it tells me something different and makes me certain that\r\nit is a pap prepared in the maternal stomach. The Pigeon softens the\r\ngrain in her crop and turns it into a sort of milky soup which she\r\nsubsequently disgorges to her brood. To all seeming, the Dung-beetle\r\ndisplays the same solicitude: she half-digests choice provender and\r\ndisgorges it in the form of a meat-extract with which she lines the\r\nwalls of the cavity where the egg is laid. Thus the larva, on hatching,\r\nfinds an easily-digested food, which very soon strengthens its stomach\r\nand enables it to attack the underlying strata, which have not been\r\nrefined in the same way. Under the semi-fluid paste is a soft,\r\nwell-compressed, uniform mass, from which every stringy particle is\r\nexcluded. Beyond this are the coarser layers, abounding in vegetable\r\nfibres. Finally, the outside of the ball is composed of the commonest\r\nmaterials, but packed and felted into a stout rind.\r\n\r\nManifestly we have here a progressive change of diet. On leaving the\r\negg, the frail grub licks the dainty broth on the walls of its cell.\r\nThere is not much of this, but it is strengthening and very nutritious.\r\nThe pap of earliest infancy is followed by the more solid food given to\r\nthe weaned nurseling, a sort of paste that stands midway between the\r\nexquisitely delicate fare at the start and the coarse provisions at the\r\nfinish. There is a thick layer of it, enough to turn the infant into a\r\nsturdy youngster. But now for the strong comes strong meat:\r\nbarley-bread with its husks, that is to say, natural droppings full of\r\nsharp bits of hay. Of this the larva has enough and to spare; and, when\r\nit has attained its full growth, there remains an enclosing layer. The\r\ncapacity of the dwelling has increased with the growth of the occupant,\r\nfed on the very substance of the walls; the original little cell with\r\nthe very thick walls is now a big cell with walls only a few\r\nmillimetres in thickness; the inner layers have become larva, nymph or\r\nBeetle, according to the period. Lastly, the ball itself is a stout\r\nshell, protecting within its spacious interior the mysterious processes\r\nof the metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nI can go no farther, for lack of observations; my records of the birth\r\nof the Sacred Beetle stop short at the egg. I have not seen the larva,\r\nwhich however is known and is described in the text-books; [14] nor\r\nhave I seen the perfect insect while still enclosed in its chamber in\r\nthe ball, before it has had any practice in its duties as a pill-roller\r\nand excavator. And this is just what I particularly wanted to see. I\r\nshould have liked to find the Dung-beetle in his native cell, recently\r\ntransformed, new to all labour, so as to examine the workman’s hand\r\nbefore it started its work. I will tell you the reason for this wish.\r\n\r\nInsects have at the end of each leg a sort of finger, or tarsus as it\r\nis called, consisting of a succession of delicate parts which may be\r\ncompared with the joints of our fingers. They end in a hooked claw. One\r\nfinger to each leg: that is the rule; and this finger, at least with\r\nthe higher Beetles and notably the Dung-beetles, has five phalanges or\r\njoints. Now, by a really strange exception, the Scarabs have no tarsi\r\non their front legs, while possessing very well-shaped ones, with five\r\njoints apiece, on the two other pairs. They are maimed, crippled: they\r\nlack, on their fore-limbs, that which in the insect very roughly\r\nrepresents our hand. A similar anomaly occurs in the Onitis- and\r\nBubas-beetles, who also belong to the Dung-beetle family. Entomology\r\nhas long recorded this curious fact, without being able to offer a\r\nsatisfactory explanation. Is the creature born maimed, does it come\r\ninto the world without fingers to its forelimbs? Or does it lose them\r\nby accident, once it is given over to its toilsome labours?\r\n\r\nOne could easily imagine this mutilation to be the result of the\r\ninsect’s hard work. Poking about, digging and raking and slicing, at\r\none time in the gravelly soil, at another in the stringy mass of\r\nmanure, do not constitute a task in which organs so delicate as the\r\ntarsi can be employed without risk. And here is an even more serious\r\nmatter: when the Beetle is rolling his ball backwards, with his head\r\ndown, it is with the extremities of his fore-feet that he presses\r\nagainst the ground. What might not happen to the insect’s feeble\r\nfingers, slender as thread, in consequence of this continual rubbing\r\nagainst the rough soil? They are merely useless encumbrances; one day\r\nor other they seem bound to disappear, crushed, torn off, worn out in a\r\nthousand ways. We know unfortunately that our own workmen are all too\r\nfrequently injured in handling heavy tools and lifting great weights;\r\neven so might the Scarab be crippled in rolling his ball, an enormous\r\nload to him. In that case his maimed arms would be a noble testimony to\r\nhis industrious life.\r\n\r\nBut straightway grave doubts begin to assail us. If these mutilations\r\nwere really accidental and the result of too strenuous work, they would\r\nbe the exception, not the rule. Because a workman or several workmen\r\nhave had a hand caught and crushed in a machine, it does not follow\r\nthat all the rest will also lose their hands. If the Scarab sometimes,\r\nor even very frequently, loses his fore-fingers in pursuing his trade\r\nas a pill-roller, there must be some at least who, more fortunate or\r\nmore skilful, have preserved their tarsi. Let us then consult the\r\nactual facts. I have observed in very large numbers the various species\r\nof Scarabs that inhabit France: Scarabæus sacer, who is common in\r\nProvence; S. semipunctatus, who keeps fairly close to the sea and\r\nfrequents the sandy shores of Cette, Palavas and the Golfe Juan;\r\nlastly, S. laticollis, who is much more widely distributed than either\r\nof the others and is found up the Rhone Valley at least as far as\r\nLyons. In addition, I have studied an African species, S. cicatricosus,\r\npicked up near Constantine. Well, in all four species, the absence of\r\ntarsi on the front legs has been an invariable fact, with not a single\r\nexception, at any rate within the range of my observations. The Scarab\r\ntherefore is maimed from the start; and it is a natural peculiarity in\r\nhis case, not an accident.\r\n\r\nBesides, there is another argument in support of this statement. If the\r\nlack of fore-fingers were an accidental mutilation, due to violent\r\nexertion, there are other insects, Dung-beetles too, who habitually\r\nundertake works of excavation even more arduous than the Scarab’s, and\r\nwho ought therefore, a fortiori, to be deprived of their front tarsi,\r\nsince these are useless and even irksome when the leg has to serve as a\r\npowerful digging-implement. The Geotrupes, for instance, who so well\r\ndeserve their name, meaning Earth-piercers, sink wells in the hard soil\r\nof the roads, among stones cemented with clay: perpendicular wells so\r\ndeep that, to inspect the cell at the bottom of them, we have to make\r\nuse of a stout spade; and even then we do not always succeed. Now these\r\nunrivalled miners, who easily open up long tunnels in a substance whose\r\nsurface the Sacred Beetle would hardly be able to disturb, have their\r\nfront tarsi intact, as if cutting through rocks were work calling for\r\ndelicate tools rather than strong ones. Everything then supports the\r\nbelief that, if we could see the Scarab while still a novice in his\r\nnative cell, we should find him to be mutilated in just the same way as\r\nthe much-travelled veteran who has worn himself out with toil.\r\n\r\nThis absence of fingers might serve as the foundation for an argument\r\nin favour of the theories now in fashion: the struggle for life and the\r\nevolution of the species. People might say:\r\n\r\n‘The Scarabs began by having tarsi to all their legs, in conformity\r\nwith the general laws of insect structure. In one way or another, some\r\nof them lost these troublesome appendages to their front legs, they\r\nbeing hurtful rather than useful. Finding themselves the better for\r\nthis mutilation, which made their work easier, they gained the\r\nadvantage over their less-favoured fellows; they founded a family by\r\nhanding down their fingerless stumps to their descendants; and the\r\nfingered insect of antiquity ended by becoming the maimed insect of our\r\ntimes.’\r\n\r\nI am ready to yield to this reasoning if you will first tell me why,\r\nwith similar but much harder tasks to perform, the Geotrupes has\r\nretained his tarsi. Until then we will go on believing that the first\r\nScarab who rolled his ball, perhaps on the shore of some lake in which\r\nthe Palæotherium bathed, was as innocent of front tarsi as his\r\ndescendant of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED BEETLE: THE BALL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no need to return to the Sacred Beetle working in the daylight\r\nor consuming his booty underground, either alone, as usually happens,\r\nor in the company of a guest: what I have said about this in a former\r\nchapter is enough; and further observations would give no new\r\ninformation of special interest. There is only one point which deserves\r\nattention. This is the method of constructing the spherical pellet,\r\nconsisting merely of provisions which the Beetle collects for his own\r\nuse and conveys to an underground dining-room excavated at a convenient\r\nspot. My present cages, which are much better arranged than those which\r\nI had at first, enable us to watch the operation at our leisure; and\r\nthis operation will furnish data which will be of the greatest value\r\nlater in explaining the mysterious structure of the nest. Let us then\r\nonce more watch the Sacred Beetle as he busies himself with his\r\nvictuals.\r\n\r\nI supply fresh provisions, derived from the Mule or, better, the Sheep.\r\nThe scent of the heap carries the news far and wide. The Beetles hasten\r\nup from every direction, extending and waving the russet feathers of\r\ntheir antennæ, a sign of acute excitement. Those who were dozing\r\nunderground split the sandy ceiling and sally forth from their cellars.\r\nThey are now all at the banquet, not without quarrels among neighbours,\r\nwho fight for the best bits and knock one another over with sudden\r\nback-handers from their broad fore-legs. Things calm down; and, without\r\nfurther disputes for the moment, each gets all that he can out of the\r\nspot where he happens to be.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the structure is, as a rule, a bit that is almost\r\nround of itself. This is the kernel which, enlarged by successive\r\nlayers, will become the ultimate ball, the size of an apricot. Having\r\ntested it and found it suitable, the owner leaves it as it is; or, at\r\nother times, he may clean it a little, scraping the outside, which is\r\nrough with bits of sand. It is now a question of constructing the ball\r\nupon this foundation. The tools are the six-toothed rake of the\r\nsemicircular shield and the broad shovels of the fore-legs, which are\r\nlikewise armed on the outer edge with strong teeth, five in number.\r\n\r\nWithout for a moment letting go of the kernel, which is held in his\r\nfour hind-legs, more particularly those of the third, the longest pair,\r\nthe Beetle turns round slowly from side to side on the top of his\r\nembryo pellet and selects from the heap around him the materials for\r\nincreasing its size. His sharp-edged forehead peels, cuts, digs and\r\nrakes; his fore-legs work in unison, gathering and drawing up an armful\r\nwhich is at once placed upon the central mass and patted down. A few\r\nvigorous applications of the toothed shovels press the new layer into\r\nposition. And so, with armful after armful carefully added on top,\r\nbeneath and at the sides, the original pill grows into a big ball.\r\n\r\nWhile working, the builder never leaves the dome of his edifice: he\r\nrevolves on his own axis, if he wants to give his attention to any\r\nlateral part; to shape the lower portion, he bends down to the point\r\nwhere it touches the ground; but from beginning to end the sphere never\r\nmoves on its base and the Beetle never relaxes his hold.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a perfectly round form, we need the potter’s wheel, whose\r\nrotation makes up for our want of skill; to enlarge his snowball and\r\nmake it into the enormous sphere which he will end by being unable to\r\nmove, the schoolboy rolls it in the snow: the rolling gives it the\r\nregularity which the direct work of the hands, guided by an\r\ninexperienced eye, would not. More dexterous than we, the Sacred Beetle\r\ncan dispense with either rolling or rotation; he moulds his ball by\r\nmeans of superadded layers, without shifting its place and without even\r\ndescending for an instant from the top of his dome to view the whole\r\nstructure from the requisite distance. The compasses of his bow-legs, a\r\nliving pair of callipers which measure and check the curve, are\r\nsufficient for his purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is only with extreme caution, however, that I introduce these\r\ncallipers, as I am perfectly convinced, by a host of facts, that\r\ninstinct has no need of special tools. If further proof were wanted,\r\nhere it is. The male Scarab’s hind-legs are perceptibly bowed; the\r\nfemale’s, on the contrary, are almost straight, though she is much the\r\ncleverer and is able, as we shall see presently, to produce\r\nmasterpieces whose exquisite form far surpasses that of a monotonous\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nIf the curved compasses play but a secondary part in the matter and\r\nperhaps no part at all, what is the guiding principle of this\r\nsphericity? If one merely took into consideration the insect’s organism\r\nand the circumstances in which the work is done, I see absolutely none.\r\nWe must go back farther, we must go back to the innate genius, the\r\ninstinct that guides the tool. The Scarab has a natural gift for making\r\nspheres, just as the Hive-bee has a natural gift for making hexagonal\r\nprisms. Both achieve geometrical perfection in their work and are\r\nindependent of any special mechanism which would force upon them the\r\nparticular shape attained.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, keep this in mind: the Sacred Beetle makes his ball\r\nby placing next to each other armful after armful of the materials\r\nwhich he has collected; he builds it up without moving it, without\r\nturning it round. He fashions the dung with the pressure of his\r\nfore-arms as the modeller in our studios fashions his clay with the\r\npressure of his thumb. And the result is not an approximate sphere,\r\nwith a lumpy surface; it is a perfect sphere, which our human\r\nmanufacturers would not disown.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for retiring with the booty so that we may bury it\r\nfarther away, at no great depth, and consume it in peace. The owner,\r\ntherefore, draws his ball out of the dung-yard; and, in accordance with\r\nancient usage, begins straightway to roll it about on the ground, a\r\nlittle at random. Any one who was not present at the beginning and who\r\nnow saw the ball rolling along, with the insect pushing it backwards,\r\nwould naturally imagine that the round shape resulted from this method\r\nof transport. It rolls, therefore it becomes round, even as a shapeless\r\nlump of clay would soon become round if trundled in the same way.\r\nThough apparently logical, the idea is erroneous in every respect: we\r\nhave just seen this perfect sphericity acquired before the ball moved\r\nfrom the spot. The rolling therefore has nothing to do with this\r\ngeometrical accuracy; it merely hardens the surface into a tough crust\r\nand polishes it a little, if only by working into the substance of the\r\npellet any coarse bits that might have made it rough at the beginning.\r\nBetween the pill that has been rolled for hours and the pill that is\r\nstationary in the dung-yard there is no difference in configuration.\r\n\r\nWhat is the advantage of this particular shape, which is invariably\r\nadopted at the very outset of the work? Does the Scarab derive any\r\nbenefit from the circular form? Your spectacles would have to be made\r\nof walnut-shells if you failed to see that the insect is brilliantly\r\ninspired when it kneads its cake into a ball. These victuals, the\r\nmeagrest of meagre pittances from the point of view of nourishment, for\r\nthe Sheep’s fourfold stomach has already extracted pretty nearly all\r\nthe assimilable matter, have to make up in quantity for what they lack\r\nin quality.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with various other Dung-beetles. They are all insatiable\r\ngluttons; they all need a much larger amount of food than their modest\r\ndimensions would lead us to suspect. The Spanish Copris, no bigger than\r\na good-sized hazel-nut, accumulates underground, for a single meal, a\r\npie as big as my fist; the Stercoraceous Geotrupes hoards in his hole a\r\nsausage nine inches long and as wide as the neck of a claret-bottle.\r\n\r\nThese mighty eaters have an easy time of it. They establish themselves\r\nimmediately under the heap dropped by some standing Mule. Here they dig\r\npassages and dining-rooms. The provisions are at the door of the house;\r\nthey form a roof for it. All that you have to do is to bring them in,\r\narmful by armful, taking only as much as you can carry comfortably, for\r\nyou can go on fetching more as long as you like. In this way,\r\nscandalous quantities of food are unobtrusively stored away in peaceful\r\nmanors whose presence no outward sign betrays.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Beetle is not so fortunate as to have his cottage underneath\r\nthe heap where the victuals are collected. He is of a vagabond\r\ntemperament; and, when his work is over, he has no great inclination\r\nfor the company of those arrant thieves, his kinsmen. He has therefore\r\nto travel to a distance with what he has secured, in quest of a site\r\nwhere he can establish himself alone. His stock of provisions, it is\r\ntrue, is comparatively modest: it is not to be mentioned in the same\r\nbreath as the Copris’ enormous cakes or the Geotrupes’ fat sausages. No\r\nmatter: modest though it be, its weight and bulk are too much for the\r\nstrength of any Beetle that might think of carrying it direct. It is\r\ntoo heavy, ever so much too heavy, for him to take between his legs and\r\nfly away with, nor could he possibly drag it, gripped in his mandibles.\r\n\r\nIf the hermit, eager to withdraw from the world, wished to make use of\r\ndirect means of conveyance, there would be only one method by which he\r\ncould accumulate in his far-off cell food enough for even a single day:\r\nthat would be to carry load after load on the wing, each load being\r\nproportionate to his strength. But what a number of journeys that would\r\ninvolve! What a lot of time would be wasted in this piecemeal\r\nharvesting! Besides, when he went back, would he not find the table\r\nalready cleared? Think of the number of guests who were giving it their\r\nattention! The opportunity is a good one; it may not occur again for a\r\nlong while. We must make the most of it without delay; the thing to do\r\nis to secure enough now to stock our larder for at least a day.\r\n\r\nBut how to set about it? Nothing could be simpler. What we cannot carry\r\nwe drag; what we cannot drag we cart by rolling it along, as witness\r\nall our wheeled conveyances. The Sacred Beetle therefore chooses the\r\nsphere as a means of transport. It is the best shape of all for\r\nrolling; it needs no axle-tree; it adapts itself admirably to the\r\ndiverse inequalities of the ground and, at each point of its surface,\r\nprovides the necessary leverage for the least expenditure of effort.\r\nSuch is the mechanical problem which the pill-roller solves. The\r\nspherical form of his treasure is not the effect of the rolling: it\r\nprecedes it; it is modelled precisely with a view to that method of\r\nconveyance, which is to make the carriage of the heavy load feasible.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Beetle is a passionate lover of the sun, whose image he\r\ncopies in the radiating notches of his rounded shield. He needs the\r\nbright light in order to make the most of the heap whence he extracts\r\nfirst provisions and next materials for nest-building. The other\r\nDung-beetles—Geotrupes, Copres, Onites, Onthophagi—for the most part\r\nhave dark, mysterious habits; they work unseen under the roof of\r\nexcrement; they do not begin their quest until night is at hand and the\r\nlast glimmer of twilight is fading. The more trustful Scarab both seeks\r\nand finds amid the gladness of the noonday sun; he works his bit of\r\nground quite openly and reaps his harvest in the hottest and brightest\r\nhours of the day. His ebon breastplate is glittering on top of the heap\r\nat times when there is naught to indicate the presence of numerous\r\nfellow-workers, belonging to other genera, who are busy underneath,\r\ncarving themselves their share of the lower strata. Darkness for\r\nothers, but for him the light!\r\n\r\nThis love of the unscreened sun has its blissful side, as the insect,\r\ndrunk with heat, shows from time to time by exultant transports; but it\r\nhas also certain disadvantages. I have never witnessed any quarrel at\r\nharvest-time between next-door neighbours, when these were Copres or\r\nGeotrupes. Working in the dark, each is ignorant of what is happening\r\nbeside him. The rich morsel secured by one of them cannot arouse the\r\nenvy of his neighbours, since it is not perceived. This perhaps\r\nexplains the pacific relations among Dung-beetles who work in the\r\ngloomy depths of the heap.\r\n\r\nMy suspicions are not unfounded. Robbery, the execrable right of the\r\nstrongest, is not the exclusive prerogative of the human brute: animals\r\nalso practise it; and the Sacred Beetle is a notorious offender. As the\r\nwork is done in the open, every one knows or is able to find out what\r\nhis companions are doing. They are mutually envious of each other’s\r\npills; and scuffles take place between proprietors wishing to leave the\r\nyard and plunderers who find it more convenient to rob their fellows\r\nthan to set to work and knead loaves for themselves. On guard on the\r\ntop of his treasure, the owner of a ball will face his assailant, who\r\nis trying to climb up, and push him into space with a stroke from his\r\nstout fore-arms. The thief is flung on his back and flounders about for\r\na moment, but he is soon up and back again. The struggle is renewed.\r\nRight does not always win, in which case the robber makes off with his\r\nprize and the victim returns to the heap to make himself another pill.\r\nIt is not unusual for a third thief to appear upon the scene during the\r\nfight and settle matters between the litigants by carrying off the\r\nproperty at issue. I am inclined to think that it was affrays of this\r\nsort that gave rise to the childish story of the Sacred Beetles who\r\nwere called to the rescue and came to lend a hand to their brothers in\r\ndistress. Brazen footpads were taken for kindly helpers.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Beetle then is an inveterate thief; he shares the tastes of\r\nthe Bedouin Arab, his fellow-countryman in Africa; he too is addicted\r\nto raiding. In his case, hunger and dearth, both evil counsellors,\r\ncannot be invoked as an explanation of this moral obliquity. Provisions\r\nare plentiful in my cages; certainly, in their days of liberty, my\r\ncaptives never lived in the midst of such abundance; and yet affrays\r\nare of frequent occurrence. They fight hotly-contested battles for the\r\nloaves, just as though bread were lacking. Poverty has nothing to do\r\nwith it, for very often the thief abandons his booty after rolling it\r\nfor a few seconds. They steal for the pleasure of stealing. As La\r\nFontaine [15] well says, there is\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ... double profit à faire:\r\n        Son bien premièrement; et puis le mal d’autrui. [16]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of this propensity for thieving, what is the best thing that a\r\nScarab can do when he has conscientiously made his ball? Obviously, to\r\nshun his fellows, to leave the premises and get away to a distant spot\r\nwhere he can consume his provisions in the depths of some hiding-place.\r\nThis is what he does; and he loses no time in doing it: he knows his\r\nkinsmen too well.\r\n\r\nHere we see the necessity for an easy method of conveyance, so that\r\nsufficient provisions may be carted in a single journey and as swiftly\r\nas possible. The Sacred Beetle likes working in the bright light, in\r\nthe sunshine. His profits therefore, made in full view of everybody,\r\nare no secret to any of the workers who have hurried to the same heap.\r\nThus is envy kindled; thus it becomes imperative to retire to a\r\ndistance, in order to avoid being robbed. This speedy retreat demands a\r\nconvenient means of transport; and that is obtained by the spherical\r\nform given to the materials collected.\r\n\r\nHere is the conclusion, unexpected but very logical and I would even\r\nsay obvious: the Sacred Beetle shapes his provisions into a ball\r\nbecause he is an ardent lover of the sun. The various Dung-beetles who\r\nwork in broad daylight, the Gymnopleuri and Sisyphi of my district,\r\nconform to the same mechanical principle: they all know the advantages\r\nof a sphere, the best rolling-apparatus; they all practise the art of\r\npill-making. The other Dung-beetles, who work in the dark, do nothing\r\nof the kind: their accumulations of food are shapeless.\r\n\r\nLife in the vivarium supplies us with some other facts which are not\r\nundeserving of the commentator’s attention. We have said that, when\r\nfresh provisions are supplied, the Sacred Beetles who are roaming about\r\ncome running up eagerly to the smoking fare. The rich effluvia also\r\nspeedily attract those who are slumbering in their burrows. Little\r\nmounds of sand pop up here and there, cracking as though for an\r\neruption, and we see new guests emerge, wiping the dust from their eyes\r\nwith the flat of their feet. Neither their dozing in that underground\r\nroom nor the thick roof of their dwelling has succeeded in foiling\r\ntheir keenness of scent: those who have had to unearth themselves reach\r\nthe lump almost as quickly as the others.\r\n\r\nThese details remind us of certain facts noted, not without surprise,\r\nby a host of observers on the sunny beaches at Cette, Palavas, the\r\nGolfe Juan and the North African coast, down to the lonely Sahara. Here\r\nthe Sacred Beetle and his kinsmen—the Half-spotted Scarab, the\r\nPock-marked Scarab and others—swarm, becoming more vigorous and more\r\nactive in proportion as the climate grows hotter. They abound; and yet\r\nvery often not one shows himself; the entomologist’s practised eye\r\nfails to discover a single specimen.\r\n\r\nBut now see things change. Seized with an urgent physiological need,\r\nyou leave your party unobtrusively and retire behind the bushes. You\r\nhave hardly stood up, hardly begun to adjust your dress,\r\nwhen—whoosh!—here comes one, here come three, here come ten, appearing\r\nsuddenly you know not whence, and swoop upon the provender. Have they\r\nhastened from afar, these bustling scavengers? Certainly not. Had they\r\nbeen apprised at a great distance by their sense of smell, which is not\r\nin itself impossible, they would not have had time to reach the quite\r\nrecent windfall so promptly. It follows, therefore, that they were\r\nclose by, within a radius of ten or twenty yards, hidden underground\r\nand dozing. A scent that is ever awake, even in the lethargy of sleep,\r\ntold them, down in their burrows, of the happy event; and, splitting\r\ntheir ceilings, they hurry up forthwith. In less time than the incident\r\ntakes to relate, a swarming population enlivens what was but now a\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nA keen and vigilant scent is the Beetle’s, we must admit; a scent which\r\nis always in operation. The Dog smells the truffle through the soil,\r\nbut he is awake; the pill-roller smells his favourite fare through the\r\nground in the opposite direction, but he is asleep. Which of the two\r\nhas the subtler scent?\r\n\r\nScience flings wide her net, welcoming even filth; and truth soars at\r\nheights where nothing can soil her. The reader will therefore be good\r\nenough to excuse certain details which cannot be avoided in a history\r\nof the Dung-beetle; he will show some indulgence for what has gone\r\nbefore and what will follow. The revolting workshop of the insect that\r\nmanipulates ordure will lead perhaps to loftier ideas than would the\r\nperfumer’s factory with its jasmine and patchouli.\r\n\r\nI have accused the Sacred Beetle of being an insatiable gormandizer. It\r\nis time to prove what I said. In my cages, which are too small to allow\r\nof much pill-rolling, my boarders often scorn to accumulate provisions\r\nand confine themselves to eating where they are. It is a good\r\nopportunity for us: the meal taken in public will tell us better than\r\nthe underground banquet what a Dung-beetle’s stomach can do.\r\n\r\nOn a very still and sultry day—these are the conditions most favourable\r\nto my anchorites’ gastronomic joys—I observe one of the diners in the\r\nopen air, from eight o’clock in the morning until eight o’clock at\r\nnight. Watch in hand, I time the glutton. He appears to have come\r\nacross a morsel greatly to his taste, for, during those twelve hours,\r\nhe never stops feasting, but remains glued to the table, absolutely\r\nstationary. At eight o’clock in the evening, I pay him a last visit.\r\nHis appetite seems undiminished; I find him in as fine fettle as at the\r\nstart. The banquet then must have gone on some time longer, until the\r\ndish had disappeared entirely. In fact, next morning there was no sign\r\nof my Beetle; and, of the sumptuous repast begun on the previous day,\r\nnaught remained but crumbs.\r\n\r\nTo eat the clock round is no small feat of gluttony; but the present\r\ninstance shows a much more remarkable feat of digestion. While matter\r\nis continuously being chewed and swallowed by the insect in front, it\r\nis reappearing, no less continuously, behind, deprived of its nutritive\r\nparticles and spun into a thin black cord, similar to cobbler’s thread.\r\nThe Scarab never evacuates except at table, so quickly are his\r\ndigestive operations performed. The wire-drawing apparatus begins to\r\nwork at the first few mouthfuls; it ceases soon after the last. Without\r\na break from beginning to end of the meal, the slender cord, ever\r\nappended to the discharging orifice, goes on piling itself into a heap\r\nwhich can easily be unrolled so long as there is no sign of\r\ndesiccation.\r\n\r\nThe working is as regular as that of a chronometer. Every minute, or\r\nrather, to be exact, every four-and-fifty seconds, a discharge takes\r\nplace and the thread is lengthened by three to four millimetres. [17]\r\nAt long intervals I employ my tweezers, remove the cord and unroll the\r\nmass along a graduated rule, in order to measure the amount produced.\r\nThe total for twelve hours is 2.88 metres. [18] As the meal and its\r\nnecessary complement, the work of the digestive apparatus, went on for\r\nsome time longer after my last visit, which was paid at eight o’clock\r\nin the evening by lantern-light, my Beetle must have spun an unbroken\r\nstercoraceous cord well over three yards in length.\r\n\r\nGiven the diameter and the length of the thread, it is easy to\r\ncalculate its volume. Nor is it difficult to arrive at the exact volume\r\nof the insect by measuring the quantity of water which it displaces\r\nwhen immersed in a narrow cylinder. The figures thus obtained are not\r\ndevoid of interest: they tell us that, at a single bout of eating, in a\r\ndozen hours, the Sacred Beetle digests very nearly his own bulk in\r\nfood. What a stomach! And, above all, what rapidity, what power of\r\ndigestion! From the very first mouthfuls, the residuum forms itself\r\ninto a thread that stretches and stretches indefinitely as long as the\r\nmeal lasts. In that amazing laboratory, which perhaps never puts up its\r\nshutters, unless it be when victuals are lacking, the material merely\r\npasses through, is at once treated by the stomach’s reagents and at\r\nonce exhausted. One may well believe that an apparatus which sanifies\r\nfilth so quickly has some part to play in the public health. We shall\r\nhave occasion to return to this important subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED BEETLE: THE PEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young shepherd who had been told in his spare time to watch the\r\ndoings of the Sacred Beetle came to me in high spirits, one Sunday in\r\nthe latter part of June, to say that he thought the time had come to\r\nbegin our investigations. He had detected the insect issuing from the\r\nground, had dug at the spot where it made its appearance, and had\r\nfound, at no great depth, the queer thing which he was bringing me.\r\n\r\nQueer it was and calculated to upset the little that I thought I knew.\r\nIn shape, it was exactly like a tiny pear that had lost all its fresh\r\ncolour and turned brown in rotting. What could this curious object be,\r\nthis pretty plaything that seemed to have come from a turner’s\r\nworkshop? Was it made by human hands? Was it a model of the fruit of\r\nthe pear-tree intended for some children’s museum? One would say so.\r\n\r\nThe little ones group themselves round me; they look at the\r\ntreasure-trove with longing eyes; they would like to add it to the\r\ncontents of their toy-box. It is much prettier in shape than an agate\r\nmarble, much more graceful than an ivory egg or a boxwood top. The\r\nmaterial, it is true, seems none too nicely chosen; but it is firm to\r\nthe touch and very artistically curved. In any case, the little pear\r\ndiscovered underground must not go to swell the nursery collection\r\nuntil we have found out more about it.\r\n\r\nCan it really be the Sacred Beetle’s work? Is there an egg inside it, a\r\ngrub? The shepherd assures me that there is. A similar pear, crushed by\r\naccident in the digging, contained, he says, a white egg, the size of a\r\ngrain of wheat. I dare not believe it, so greatly does the object which\r\nhe has brought me differ from the ball which I expected to see.\r\n\r\nTo open the mysterious prize and ascertain its contents would perhaps\r\nbe imprudent: such an act of violence might jeopardize the life of the\r\ngerm within, always provided that the Scarab’s egg be there, a matter\r\nof which the shepherd seems convinced. Besides, I say to myself, the\r\npear-shape, so totally opposed to all our accepted ideas, is probably\r\naccidental. Who knows if luck will ever give me anything like it again?\r\nI should be wise to keep the thing just as it is and await events;\r\nabove all, I should be wise to go and seek for information on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd was at his post by daybreak the next morning. I joined him\r\non some slopes that had been lately cleared of their trees, where the\r\nhot summer sun, which strikes with such force on the back of one’s\r\nneck, could not reach us for two or three hours. In the cool morning\r\nair, with the Sheep browsing under Sultan’s care, the two of us\r\nscattered on our search.\r\n\r\nA Sacred Beetle’s burrow is soon found: you can tell it by the fresh\r\nlittle mound of earth above it. With a vigorous turn of the wrist, my\r\ncompanion digs away with the little pocket-trowel which I have lent\r\nhim. Incorrigible earth-scraper that I am, I seldom set forth without\r\nthis light but serviceable tool. While he digs, I lie down, the better\r\nto see the arrangement and furniture of the cellar which we are\r\nunearthing, and I am all eyes. The shepherd uses the trowel as a lever\r\nand, with his other hand, holds back and pushes aside the soil.\r\n\r\nHere we are! A cave opens out and, in the moist warmth of the yawning\r\nvault, I see a splendid pear lying full length upon the ground. No, I\r\nshall not soon forget this first revelation of the Scarab’s maternal\r\nmasterpiece. My excitement could have been no greater had I been an\r\narchæologist digging among the ancient relics of Egypt and lighting\r\nupon the sacred insect of the dead, carved in emerald, in some\r\nPharaonic crypt. O ineffable moment, when truth suddenly shines forth!\r\nWhat other joys can compare with that holy rapture! The shepherd was in\r\nthe seventh heaven; he laughed in response to my smile and was happy in\r\nmy gladness.\r\n\r\nLuck does not repeat itself: ‘Non bis in idem,’ says the old adage. And\r\nhere have I twice had under my eyes this curious pear-shape. Is it by\r\nany chance the normal shape, not subject to exception? Must we abandon\r\nthe thought of a sphere similar to those which the insect rolls along\r\nthe ground? Let us continue and we shall see.\r\n\r\nA second hole is found. Like the previous one, it contains a pear. My\r\ntwo treasures are as like as two peas; they might have issued from the\r\nsame mould. And here is a valuable confirmatory detail: in the second\r\nburrow, by the side of the pear and fondly embracing it, is the mother\r\nBeetle, engaged no doubt in giving it the finishing touches before\r\nleaving the underground cave for good. All doubts are dispelled: I know\r\nthe worker and I know the work.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the morning provided abundant corroboration of these\r\npremisses: before an intolerable sun drove me from the slope which I\r\nwas exploring, I was in possession of a dozen pears identical in shape\r\nand almost in dimensions. On several occasions the mother was present\r\nin the workshop.\r\n\r\nTo conclude this part of our subject, let me tell what the future held\r\nin store for me. All through the dog-days, from the end of June until\r\nSeptember, I paid almost daily visits to the spots frequented by the\r\nSacred Beetle; and the burrows unearthed by my trowel furnished an\r\namount of evidence exceeding my fondest hopes. The insects reared in\r\ncaptivity supplied me with more facts, though these, it is true, were\r\nvery scanty in comparison with the rich crop from the open fields. All\r\ntold, about a hundred nests, at the lowest computation, passed through\r\nmy hands; and they were invariably the graceful pear-shape, never,\r\nabsolutely never, the round shape of the pill, never the ball of which\r\nthe books tell us.\r\n\r\nI myself once shared this error, placing as I did implicit confidence\r\nin the words of the learned authorities. My old hunting-expeditions on\r\nthe Plateau des Angles led to no result; my attempts at home-rearing\r\nfailed pitifully; and yet I was anxious to give my young readers some\r\nidea of the nest built by the Sacred Beetle. I therefore adopted the\r\ntraditional theory of the round shape; and then, taking analogy for my\r\nguide, I made use of the little that I had learnt from other\r\ndung-rollers to attempt an approximate sketch of the Sacred Beetle’s\r\nwork. It was an unlucky shot. Analogy no doubt is a valuable servant,\r\nbut oh, how poor compared with direct observation! Deceived by this\r\nguide, so often untrustworthy amid the inexhaustible variety of life, I\r\nhelped to perpetuate the blunder; and so I hasten to apologize, begging\r\nthe reader to dismiss from his mind the little that I have said\r\nheretofore on the probable nest-building methods of the Sacred Beetle.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us unfold the authentic story, admitting as evidence only\r\nfacts actually observed again and again. The Sacred Beetle’s nest is\r\nbetrayed on the outside by a little heap of earth, by a tiny mound\r\nformed of the superfluous soil which the mother, when closing up the\r\nabode, has been unable to replace, part of the excavation having to be\r\nleft empty. Under this mound is a shaft which is rarely more than four\r\ninches in depth, followed by a horizontal gallery, either straight or\r\nwinding, which ends in a spacious hall, large enough to contain a man’s\r\nfist. This is the crypt in which the egg lies enveloped in food and\r\nsubjected to the incubation of a hot sun baking the ground only a few\r\ninches above it; this is the roomy workshop in which the mother,\r\nunfettered in her movements, has kneaded and shaped the future\r\nnurseling’s food into a pear.\r\n\r\nThis stercoraceous bread has its main axis lying in a horizontal\r\nposition. Its shape and size remind one exactly of those little\r\nMidsummer’s Day pears which, by virtue of their bright colouring, their\r\nflavour and their early ripening, are so popular with the children.\r\nThere is a slight variation in the bulk of the pears found. The largest\r\ndimensions are 45 millimetres in length by 30 millimetres in width;\r\n[19] the smallest are 35 millimetres by 28. [20]\r\n\r\nWithout being as polished as stucco, the surface, which is absolutely\r\neven, is carefully glazed with a thin layer of red earth. At first soft\r\nas potter’s clay, the pyriform loaf soon dries and acquires a stout\r\ncrust which refuses to yield to the pressure of the fingers. Wood\r\nitself is no harder. This rind is the defensive wrapper that isolates\r\nthe recluse from the world and allows him to consume his victuals in\r\nprofound peace. But, should the central mass become dried up, then the\r\ndanger is extremely serious. We shall have occasion to refer to the\r\nunhappy lot of the grub condemned to a diet of too stale bread.\r\n\r\nWhat dough does the Scarab’s bakehouse use? Who are the purveyors? The\r\nHorse and the Mule? By no means. Yet that was what I expected—and so\r\nwould anybody—after seeing the insect make such energetic raids, for\r\nits own use, upon the overflowing store of an ordinary lump of dung.\r\nThat is where it habitually manufactures the rolling ball which it goes\r\nand consumes in some underground retreat.\r\n\r\nWhile coarse bread, full of bits of hay, is good enough for the mother,\r\nshe becomes more particular where her children are concerned. She now\r\nwants the very daintiest pastry, rich in nourishment and easily\r\ndigested; she wants the ovine manna: not that which the Sheep of a\r\ncostive habit scatters in trails of black olives, but that which,\r\nelaborated in a less dry intestine, is fashioned into a single flat\r\ncake. This is the material required, the dough exclusively used. It is\r\nno longer the poor and stringy produce of the Horse, but an unctuous,\r\nplastic, homogeneous thing, soaked through and through with nutritive\r\njuices. Its plasticity and delicacy make it an admirable medium for an\r\nartistic piece of work like the Scarab’s pear, while its alimentary\r\nqualities suit the weak stomach of the new-born grub. There may not be\r\nmuch of it, but the infant Beetle will find it sufficient for his\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nThis explains the smallness of these pears, a point which made me\r\nsuspicious of the origin of my treasure until I found the mother\r\npresent with the provisions. I was unable to see in those little pears\r\nthe bill of fare of a future Sacred Beetle, who is so great a glutton\r\nand of so remarkable a size.\r\n\r\nIt probably also explains my failure in the old days with my cages. In\r\nmy profound ignorance of the Sacred Beetle’s domestic life, I used to\r\nsupply her with what I could pick up here and there, droppings of Horse\r\nor Mule; and the Beetle refused it for her children and declined to\r\nbuild a nest. To-day, taught by my experience in the fields, I go to\r\nthe Sheep for my supplies and all is well in the cages. Does this mean\r\nthat the insect never employs for its breeding-pears materials derived\r\nfrom the Horse, even if selected from the finest strata and carefully\r\ncleansed from objectionable matter? If the best cannot be obtained, is\r\nthe middling refused? I prefer to be cautious and give no opinion. What\r\nI can declare is that I inspected over a hundred burrows with a view to\r\nwriting this story, and that in every case, from first to last, the\r\nlarva’s provisions had been obtained from the Sheep.\r\n\r\nWhere is the egg in that nutritive mass so novel in shape? One would be\r\ninclined to place it in the centre of the fat, round paunch. This\r\ncentral point is best protected against accidents from the outside,\r\nbest off in the matter of temperature. Besides, the nascent grub would\r\nhere find a deep layer of food on every side of it and would not be\r\nliable to make mistakes in the first mouthfuls. Everything being of the\r\nsame kind all round it, there would be no necessity for it to pick and\r\nchoose; wherever it chanced to apply its prentice tooth, it could\r\ncontinue without hesitation its first dainty repast.\r\n\r\nAll this sounds so very rational that I allowed myself to be led away\r\nby it. In the first pear that I examined, layer by layer, shaving off\r\nslices with my penknife, I looked for the egg in the centre of the\r\npaunch, feeling almost certain of finding it there. To my great\r\nsurprise, it was not there. Instead of being hollow, the centre of the\r\npear is full and consists of one continuous uniform alimentary mass.\r\n\r\nMy deductions, which any observer in my place would certainly have\r\nshared, seemed very reasonable; the Scarab, however, is of another way\r\nof thinking. We have our logic, of which we are rather proud; the\r\ndung-kneader has hers, which is better than ours in this instance. She\r\nhas her own foresight, takes her own precautions; and she places the\r\negg elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut where? Why, in the narrow part of the pear, in the neck, right at\r\nthe end! Let us cut this neck lengthwise, taking the necessary\r\nprecautions not to damage the contents. It is hollowed into a niche\r\nwith polished and shiny walls. This niche is the tabernacle of the\r\ngerm, the hatching-chamber. The egg, which is very large in proportion\r\nto the size of the mother, is an elongated oval, about ten millimetres\r\nin length with a diameter of five millimetres at the widest part. [21]\r\nIt is white and is separated on all sides from the walls of the chamber\r\nby a slight empty space, the only contact being at the rear end of the\r\negg, which adheres to the top of the niche. Lying horizontally, in\r\nconformity with the normal position of the pear, the whole of it,\r\nexcepting the point of attachment, thus rests upon an air-mattress,\r\nwarmest and most buoyant of beds.\r\n\r\nNow we know all about it. Let us next try to understand the Scarab’s\r\nlogic. Let us find out why she has to make that pear of hers, so\r\nunusual a shape in insect structures; let us seek to explain the\r\nsuitability of the egg’s curious position. We are venturing on\r\ndangerous ground when we enquire into the how and wherefore of things.\r\nWe easily lose our footing in that mysterious land where the moving\r\nsoil gives way beneath us, swallowing the foolhardy in the quicksands\r\nof error. Must we abandon such excursions, because of the risk? Why\r\nshould we?\r\n\r\nWhat does our science, so sublime compared with the feebleness of our\r\nresources, so contemptible in the face of the boundless stretches of\r\nthe unknown, what does it know of absolute reality? Nothing. The world\r\ninterests us only because of the ideas which we form of it. Remove the\r\nidea and everything becomes a desert, chaos, nothingness. An\r\nomnium-gatherum of facts is not knowledge, but at most a cold catalogue\r\nwhich we must thaw and quicken at the fire of the mind; we must bring\r\nto it thought and the light of reason; we must interpret.\r\n\r\nLet us adopt this course to explain the work of the Sacred Beetle.\r\nPerhaps we shall end by attributing our own logic to the insect. After\r\nall, it will be just as remarkable to see a wonderful agreement prevail\r\nbetween that which reason dictates to us and that which instinct\r\ndictates to the insect.\r\n\r\nA grave danger threatens the Sacred Beetle in his grub state: the\r\ndrying-up of the food. The crypt in which the larval life is spent has\r\na layer of earth, some four inches thick, for a ceiling. Of what avail\r\nis this flimsy screen against the torrid heat that beats down upon the\r\nsoil, baking it like a brick to a far greater depth than that? At times\r\nthe temperature of the grub’s abode mounts towards boiling-point; when\r\nI thrust my hand into it, I feel the hot air of a Turkish bath.\r\n\r\nThe provisions, therefore, even though they have to last but three or\r\nfour weeks, are liable to dry up before that time and to become\r\nuneatable. When, instead of the soft bread of its first meal, the\r\nunhappy grub finds nothing to stay its stomach but a horrible crust,\r\nhard as a pebble and tooth-proof, it is bound to perish of hunger. And\r\nit does actually so perish. I have found numbers of these victims of\r\nthe August sun which, after eating plentifully of the fresh food and\r\ndigging themselves a cell in it, had succumbed, unable to continue\r\nbiting into provisions that had become too hard. There remained a thick\r\nshell, a sort of closed oven, in which the poor thing lay baked and\r\nshrivelled up.\r\n\r\nWhile the grub dies of hunger in a shell which has dried into stone,\r\nthe full-grown insect that has completed its transformations dies there\r\ntoo, for it is incapable of bursting the prison and freeing itself. I\r\nshall come back later to the question of the final emergence and will\r\nsay no more about it for the present. Let us confine our attention to\r\nthe troubles of the grub.\r\n\r\nThe drying-up of the victuals is, I have said, fatal to it. This is\r\nproved by the larvæ found baked in their oven; it is also proved, in a\r\nmore definite fashion, by the following experiment. In July, the period\r\nof active nidification, I place in wooden or cardboard boxes a dozen\r\npears unearthed that morning from their native burrows. These boxes,\r\ncarefully closed, are put away in the dark, in my study, where the same\r\ntemperature prevails as outside. Well, in none of them is the infant\r\nreared: sometimes the egg shrivels; sometimes the worm is hatched, but\r\nvery soon dies. On the other hand, in tin boxes or glass receptacles,\r\neverything goes well: not one attempt at rearing fails.\r\n\r\nWhence do these differences arise? Simply from this: in the high\r\ntemperature of July, evaporation proceeds apace under the permeable\r\nwooden or cardboard screen; the food-pear dries up; and the unfortunate\r\nworm dies of hunger. In the impermeable tin boxes, in the\r\ncarefully-sealed glass receptacles, there is no evaporation; the\r\nprovisions retain their softness; and the grubs thrive as well as in\r\ntheir native burrow.\r\n\r\nThe insect employs two methods to ward off the danger of desiccation.\r\nIn the first place, it compresses the outer layer with all the strength\r\nof its stout, flat fore-arms, turning it into a protective rind more\r\nhomogeneous and more compact than the central mass. If I break one of\r\nthese dried-up provision-boxes, the rind usually comes clean away,\r\nleaving the centre part bare. The whole suggests the shell and kernel\r\nof a nut. The pressure exercised by the mother when manipulating her\r\npear has affected the surface layer to a depth of a few millimetres,\r\nand this has produced the rind; the influence of the pressure is not\r\nfelt lower down, and the result is the big central kernel. In the hot\r\nsummer months, the housewife puts her bread into a closed pan, to keep\r\nit fresh. This is what the insect does, in its fashion: by dint of\r\ncompression, it covers the family bread with a pan.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Beetle does not stop there: she becomes a geometrician\r\ncapable of solving a delicate problem of minimum values. Other\r\nconditions being equal, evaporation obviously takes place in proportion\r\nto the extent of the evaporating surface. The alimentary mass must\r\ntherefore be given the smallest possible surface, in order to reduce\r\nthe waste of moisture as much as possible; at the same time, this\r\nminimum surface must incorporate the maximum aggregate of nutritive\r\nmaterials, so that the grub may find sufficient nourishment. Now what\r\nis the form that encloses the greatest bulk within the smallest\r\nsuperficial area? Geometry answers, the sphere.\r\n\r\nThe Scarab, therefore, shapes the larva’s ration into a sphere (we will\r\nleave the neck of the pear out of the question for the moment); and\r\nthis round form is not the result of blind mechanical conditions,\r\nimposing an inevitable shape upon the worker; it is not the violent\r\neffect of the rolling along the ground. We have already seen that, for\r\nthe purpose of easier and swifter transit, the insect kneads into a\r\nperfect sphere the materials which it intends to consume at a distance,\r\nwithout moving that sphere from the spot on which it rests; in short,\r\nwe have realized that the round form precedes the rolling.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, it will be seen presently that the pear destined for\r\nthe grub is fashioned in the burrow. It undergoes no rolling-process,\r\nit is not even moved. The Sacred Beetle gives it the requisite outline\r\nexactly as a modelling artist might do, shaping his clay under the\r\npressure of his thumb.\r\n\r\nWith the tools which it possesses, the insect could obtain other forms\r\nof a less delicate curve than its pear-shaped piece of work. It could,\r\nfor instance, make a rough cylinder, the sausage customary among the\r\nGeotrupes; or, simplifying the work to the utmost, it could leave the\r\nlump without any definite form, just as it happened to find it. Things\r\nwould proceed all the faster and would leave more time for playing in\r\nthe sun. But no: the Sacred Beetle never chooses any shape but the\r\nsphere, though it necessitates such scrupulous accuracy; she acts as\r\nthough she knew the laws of evaporation and geometry from beginning to\r\nend.\r\n\r\nIt remains for us to examine the neck of the pear. What can be its\r\nobject, its use? The reply forces itself upon us irresistibly. This\r\nneck contains the egg, in the hatching-chamber. Now every germ, whether\r\nof plant or animal, needs air, the primary stimulus of life. To admit\r\nthat vivifying combustible, the shell of a bird’s egg is riddled with\r\nan endless number of pores. The pear of the Sacred Beetle may be\r\ncompared with the egg of the Hen. Its shell is the rind, hardened by\r\npressure, to avoid untimely desiccation; its nutritive mass, its meat,\r\nits yolk is the soft ball sheltered under the rind; its air-chamber is\r\nthe terminal space, the cavity in the neck, where the air envelops the\r\ngerm on every side. Where would that germ be better off, for breathing,\r\nthan in its hatching-chamber projecting into the atmosphere and giving\r\nfree play to the passage of gases through its thin and easily permeable\r\nwall?\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the mass, on the other hand, aeration is not so easy.\r\nThe hardened rind does not possess pores like an egg-shell’s; and the\r\ncentral kernel is formed of compact matter. The air enters it\r\nnevertheless, for presently the grub will be able to live in it: the\r\ngrub, a robust organism which does not need the same tender flutter of\r\nlife as the sensitive germ.\r\n\r\nWhere the adolescent larva thrives, the egg would die of suffocation.\r\nHere is a proof of it. I take a small, wide-necked phial and fill it\r\nwith Sheep-dung, the fare required in this case. I push in a bit of\r\nstick and obtain a shaft which shall represent the hatching-chamber.\r\nDown this shaft I place an egg carefully moved from its cell. I close\r\nthe orifice and cover up everything with a thickly-heaped layer of the\r\nsame material. Here, in all excepting the shape, we have an artificial\r\nreproduction of the Sacred Beetle’s pellet; only, in this instance, the\r\negg is in the centre of the mass, the place which over-hasty\r\nconsiderations made us but now believe the most suitable. Well, the\r\npoint which we selected is fatal to life. The egg dies there. What has\r\nit lacked? Apparently, proper aeration.\r\n\r\nPlenteously enveloped by the clammy mass, which is a bad conductor of\r\nheat, it is also deprived of the mild temperature needed for its\r\nhatching. In addition to air, every germ requires heat. In order to be\r\nas near as possible to the incubator, the germ in the bird’s egg is on\r\nthe surface of the yolk and, thanks to its extreme mobility, always\r\ncomes to the top, no matter what the position of the egg may be. Thus\r\nthe most is made of the maternal heating-apparatus seated upon the\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nIn the insect’s case, the incubator is the earth, which is warmed by\r\nthe sun. Its germ likewise comes close to the heating-apparatus; it\r\ngoes as near as it can to the universal incubator, in search of its\r\nspark of life; instead of remaining sunk in the middle of the inert\r\nmass, it takes up its position at the top of a projecting nipple,\r\nlapped on all sides by the warm emanations of the soil.\r\n\r\nThese conditions, air and warmth, are so fundamental that no\r\nDung-beetle neglects them. The piles of food hoarded vary in form, as\r\nwe shall have an opportunity of seeing: in addition to the pear, such\r\nshapes as the cylinder, the ovoid, the pill and the thimble are\r\nadopted, according to the genus of the manipulator; but, amid this\r\ndiversity of outline, one primary feature remains unchanged, and that\r\nis the placing of the egg in a hatching-chamber close to the surface\r\nwhich allows free access to air and heat. And the most gifted in this\r\ndelicate art of knowing just where to place the egg is the Sacred\r\nBeetle with her pear.\r\n\r\nI was saying just now that this foremost of dung-kneaders behaved with\r\na logic that rivals our own. By this time, my statement has been\r\ncompletely established. Here is something better still. Let us submit\r\nthe following problem to our leading scientific lights: a germ is\r\naccompanied by a mass of victuals liable soon to be rendered useless by\r\ndesiccation. How should the alimentary mass be shaped? Where should the\r\negg be laid so as to be easily influenced by air and heat?\r\n\r\nThe first question of the problem has already been answered. Knowing\r\nthat evaporation varies in proportion to the extent of the evaporating\r\nsurface, science declares that the victuals shall be arranged in the\r\nform of a ball, because the spherical shape is that which encloses the\r\ngreatest amount of material within the smallest surface. As for the\r\negg, since it requires a protecting sheath to keep it from any harmful\r\ncontact, it shall be contained within a thin, cylindrical case; and\r\nthis case shall be fixed upon the sphere.\r\n\r\nThus the requisite conditions are fulfilled: the provisions, packed\r\ninto a ball, keep fresh; the egg, protected by its slender, cylindrical\r\nsheath, receives the influence of warmth and air without impediment.\r\nThe strictly needful has been obtained; but it is very ugly. Utility\r\nhas paid no attention to beauty.\r\n\r\nAn artist corrects the crude work of reason. He replaces the cylinder\r\nby a semi-ellipsoid, so much prettier in form; he joins this ellipsoid\r\nto the sphere by means of a graceful curved surface; and the whole\r\nbecomes the pear, the necked gourd. It is now a work of art, a thing of\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Beetle does exactly what æsthetic considerations dictate to\r\nourselves. Can she, too, have a sense of beauty? Is she able to\r\nappreciate the elegance of her pear? True, she does not see it: she\r\nmanipulates it in profound darkness. But she touches it. A poor touch\r\nhers, roughly clad in horn, yet not insensible, after all, to delicate\r\ncontours.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me to put children’s intelligence to the test with this\r\nproblem in æsthetics suggested by the Sacred Beetle’s work. I wanted\r\nvery immature minds, hardly opened, still slumbering in the misty\r\nclouds of early childhood, in short, approximating as nearly as\r\npossible to the vague intellect of the insect, if any such\r\napproximation is permissible. At the same time I wanted them to be\r\nclear-headed enough to understand me. I selected some untutored\r\nyoungsters, of whom the oldest was six.\r\n\r\nI submitted to this tribunal the work of the Sacred Beetle and a\r\ngeometrical production of my own fingers, representing in the same\r\ndimensions the sphere surmounted by a short cylinder. Taking each of\r\nthem aside, as though for confession, lest the opinion of one should\r\ninfluence the opinion of another, I sprang my two toys upon them and\r\nasked them which they thought the prettier. There were five of them;\r\nand they all voted for the Sacred Beetle’s pear.\r\n\r\nI was struck by this unanimity. The rough little peasant-lad, who has\r\nscarcely yet learnt how to blow his nose, has already a certain sense\r\nof elegance of form. He can distinguish between the beautiful and the\r\nugly. Can this be also true of the Sacred Beetle? No one who knew what\r\nhe was talking about would venture to say yes; no one either would\r\nventure to say no. It is a question that cannot be answered, since we\r\ncannot consult the one and only judge in this case. After all, the\r\nsolution might very well be exceedingly simple. What does the flower\r\nknow of its glorious corolla? What does the snowflake know of its\r\nexquisite hexagonal stars? Like the flower and the snowflake, the\r\nSacred Beetle might well be ignorant of the beautiful, though it be her\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThere is beauty everywhere, on the express condition that there be an\r\neye capable of recognizing it. Is this eye of the mind, this eye which\r\nappraises correctness of form, to some extent an attribute of the dumb\r\ncreation? If the Toad’s ideal of beauty is unquestionably the She-toad,\r\noutside the irresistible attraction of the sexes is there really such a\r\nthing as beauty to an animal? Considered generally, what is beauty,\r\nactually? Beauty is order. What is order? Harmony in the whole design.\r\nWhat is harmony? Harmony is.... But enough. Answers would follow upon\r\nquestions without ever touching the real principle of it all, the\r\nimmovable foundation. What a lot of philosophizing over a lump of dung!\r\nIt is high time to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED BEETLE: THE MODELLING\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we are on solid ground, in the domain of facts, of things that can\r\nbe seen and recorded. How does the Sacred Beetle obtain the maternal\r\npear? To begin with, it is certain that this shape is not achieved by\r\nthe process of transport, for it is not at all what one would get from\r\nhaphazard rolling in all directions. The belly of the gourd might be\r\nmade in that way; but the neck, the elliptical nipple hollowed into a\r\nhatching-chamber: that delicate work could never result from a series\r\nof violent, irregular bumps. A goldsmith does not hammer out a jewel on\r\na blacksmith’s anvil! Together with other sound reasons already\r\nadduced, the pear-shaped outline delivers us, I hope, once and for all,\r\nfrom the antiquated belief that the egg has its home inside a\r\nroughly-jolted sphere.\r\n\r\nTo produce his masterpiece, the sculptor retires to his den. Even so\r\nthe Sacred Beetle. She shuts herself in her crypt, with the materials\r\nwhich she has brought down there, in order to concentrate upon her\r\nmodelling. The block out of which she is to shape her pear may be\r\nobtained in two ways. Sometimes the Beetle manages to secure from the\r\nheap, by the method familiar to us, a fine mass of material which is\r\nkneaded into a ball on the spot and which is a perfect sphere before it\r\nis set in motion. Were it only a question of provisions intended for\r\nher own meal, she would never act otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen the ball is deemed big enough, if the place does not suit her\r\nwherein to dig the burrow, she sets out with her rolling burden, going\r\nat random till she lights upon a favourable spot. On the way, the ball,\r\nwithout becoming any rounder than it was to start with, hardens a\r\nlittle on the surface and is encrusted with earth and tiny grains of\r\nsand. This earthy rind, picked up on the road, is an authentic sign of\r\na more or less long journey. The detail is not without importance; we\r\nshall find it useful presently.\r\n\r\nAt other times, the Beetle may hit upon a suitable site for her burrow\r\nclose to the heap which has provided her block. The soil may be free\r\nfrom pebbles and easy to dig. In that case there is no need of any\r\ntravelling, and consequently no need to make a ball. The soft droppings\r\nof the Sheep are gathered and stored as found, entering the workshop as\r\na shapeless mass, either in one lump or, if need be, in several.\r\n\r\nThis rarely happens under natural conditions, because of the roughness\r\nof the ground, which is full of stones and flints. Sites practicable\r\nfor easy digging are few and far between; and the insect has to roam\r\nabout, with its burden, to find them. In my cages, on the other hand,\r\nwhere the layer of earth has been passed through a sieve, it is the\r\nusual case. Here the soil is easy to dig at any point; and so the\r\nmother, who is anxious to get her eggs laid, merely lowers the nearest\r\nlump underground, without waiting to give it any definite form.\r\n\r\nWhether this storing without any preliminary modelling or carting take\r\nplace in the fields or in my cages, the ultimate result is most\r\nstriking. One day, I see a shapeless lump disappear into the crypt.\r\nNext day, or the day after, I visit the workshop and find the artist in\r\nfront of her work. The original formless mass, the armfuls of scrapings\r\ncarried down, have become a pear perfect in outline and exquisitely\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nThe artistic object bears the marks of its method of manufacture. The\r\npart that rests upon the bottom of the cavity is crusted over with\r\nearthy particles; all the rest is of a glossy polish. Owing to its\r\nweight, owing also to the pressure exercised when the Beetle\r\nmanipulated it, the pear, while still quite soft, became soiled with\r\ngrains of earth on the side that touched the floor of the workshop; on\r\nthe remainder, which is the larger part, it has retained the delicate\r\nfinish which the insect was able to give it.\r\n\r\nThe inferences to be drawn from these carefully noted details are\r\nobvious: the pear is no turner’s work; it has not been obtained by any\r\nsort of rolling on the ground of the spacious studio, for in that case\r\nit would have been soiled with earth all over. Besides, its projecting\r\nneck eliminates this method of fabrication. And its unblemished upper\r\nsurface is eloquent testimony that it has not even been turned from one\r\nside to the other. The Beetle, therefore, has moulded it where it lies,\r\nwithout turning or shifting it at all; she has modelled it with little\r\ntaps of her broad paddles, just as we saw her model her ball in the\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to what usually happens in the free state. The\r\nmaterials then come from a distance and are carried into the burrow in\r\nthe form of a ball covered with soil on every part of its surface. What\r\nwill the insect do with this sphere which contains the paunch of the\r\nfuture pear ready-made? It would be easy to answer this if I concerned\r\nmyself only with results, without troubling how those results were\r\nobtained. It would be enough for me, as I have often done, to capture\r\nthe mother in her burrow with her ball and take the whole lot home, to\r\nmy insect laboratory, in order to keep a close watch on events.\r\n\r\nI fill a large glass jar with earth, sifted, moistened and heaped to\r\nthe desired depth. I place the mother and the beloved pill which she is\r\nclasping on the surface of this artificial soil. I stow away the\r\napparatus in a dim corner and wait. My patience is not tried very long.\r\nUrged by the insistent ovaries, the Beetle resumes her interrupted\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, I see her, still on the surface, destroying her ball,\r\nripping it up, cutting it to pieces, shredding it. This is not in the\r\nleast the act of one in despair who, finding herself a captive, breaks\r\nthe precious object in her madness. It is based on sound hygienics. A\r\nscrupulous inspection of the morsel which she has gathered in haste,\r\namong lawless competitors, is often necessary, for supervision is not\r\nalways easy on the harvest-field itself, in the midst of thieves and\r\nrobbers. The ball may be harbouring a collection of little Onthophagi\r\nand Aphodii who passed unnoticed in the heat of acquisition.\r\n\r\nThese involuntary intruders, finding themselves very well-off in the\r\nheart of the mass, would make good use of the future pear, much to the\r\ndetriment of the legitimate consumer. The ball must be purged of this\r\nhungry brood. The mother, therefore, pulls it to pieces and scrutinizes\r\nthe fragments closely. Then the sorted bits are carefully put together\r\nagain and the ball remade, this time without any earthy rind. It is\r\ndragged underground and becomes an immaculate pear, always excepting\r\nthe surface touching the soil.\r\n\r\nOftener still, the ball is thrust by the mother into the soil in the\r\njar just as I took it from the burrow, still with the rough crust which\r\nit has acquired in its cross-country rolling from the place where it\r\nwas obtained to the place where the insect intends to use it. In that\r\nevent, I find it at the bottom of my jar transformed into a pear, but\r\nstill rough and encrusted with earth and sand over the whole of its\r\nsurface, thus proving that the pear-shaped outline has not demanded a\r\ngeneral recasting of the mass, inside as well as out, but has been\r\nobtained by simple pressure and by drawing out the neck.\r\n\r\nThis is how, in the vast majority of cases, things happen under normal\r\nconditions. Almost all the pears that I dig up in the fields have rinds\r\nand are unpolished, some more, others less. If we put on one side the\r\ninevitable incrustations due to the carting-process, these blemishes\r\nwould seem to point to a prolonged rolling in the interior of the\r\nsubterranean manor. The few which I find perfectly smooth, especially\r\nthose wonderfully neat specimens furnished by my cages, dispel this\r\nmistake entirely. They show us that, when the materials are collected\r\nnear the burrow and stored away unshaped, the pear is modelled wholly\r\nwithout rolling; they prove to us that, in other cases, the lines of\r\nearth and grit on the outside of the ball are not a sign of its having\r\nbeen rolled to and fro in the workshop, but are simply the marks of a\r\nfairly long journey on the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nTo be present at the construction of the pear is no easy matter: the\r\nmystery-loving artist obstinately refuses to do any work as soon as the\r\nlight reaches her. She needs absolute darkness for her modelling; and I\r\nneed light if I would see her at her task. It is impossible to unite\r\nthe two conditions. Let us try, nevertheless; let us catch some\r\nglimpses of the truth whose fulness eludes our vision.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements made are as follows: I once more take the big jar. I\r\ncover the bottom with a layer of earth two or three inches deep. To\r\nobtain the transparent workshop necessary for my observations, I fix a\r\ntripod on the earthy layer and, on this support, about four inches in\r\nheight, I place a round piece of deal of the same diameter as the jar.\r\nThe glass-walled chamber thus marked out will represent the roomy crypt\r\nin which the insect works. A piece is scolloped out of the edge of the\r\ndeal block, large enough to permit of the passage of the Beetle and her\r\nball. Lastly, above this screen, I heap a layer of earth as deep as the\r\njar allows.\r\n\r\nDuring the operation, a portion of the upper earth falls through the\r\nopening and slips down to the lower space in a wide inclined plane.\r\nThis was a circumstance which I had foreseen and which was\r\nindispensable to my plan. By means of this slope, the artist, when she\r\nhas found the communicating trap-door, will make for the transparent\r\ncell which I have arranged for her. She will make for it, of course,\r\nonly provided that she be in perfect darkness. I therefore make a\r\ncardboard cylinder, closed at the top, and place it over the glass jar.\r\nLeft standing where it is, the opaque sheath will provide the dusk\r\nwhich the insect wants; suddenly raised, it will give the light which I\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nThings being thus arranged, I go in quest of a mother who has just\r\nwithdrawn into solitude with her ball. A morning’s search is enough to\r\nprovide me with what I need. I place the mother and her ball on the\r\nsurface of the upper layer of earth; I cap the apparatus with its\r\ncardboard sheath; and I wait. I say to myself that the Beetle is too\r\npersevering to give up work until her egg is housed and that she will\r\ntherefore dig herself a new burrow, dragging her ball with her as she\r\ngoes; she will pass through the upper layer of earth, which is not\r\nsufficiently thick; she will come upon the deal board, an obstacle\r\nsimilar to the broken stones that often bar her passage in the course\r\nof her normal excavations; she will investigate the cause of the\r\nimpediment and, finding the opening, will descend through this\r\ntrap-door to the lower compartment, which, being free and roomy, will\r\nrepresent to the insect the crypt whence I have just removed it. But\r\nall this takes time; and I must wait for the morrow to satisfy my\r\nimpatient curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe hour has come: let us go and see. The study-door was left open\r\nyesterday: the mere sound of the door-handle might disturb and stop my\r\ndistrustful worker. By way of greater precaution, before entering I put\r\non noiseless slippers. And now, whoosh! The cylinder is removed.\r\nCapital! My forecast was correct.\r\n\r\nThe Beetle occupies the glazed studio. I surprise her at work, with her\r\nbroad foot laid on the rough model of the pear. But, startled by the\r\nsudden light, she remains motionless, as though petrified. This lasts a\r\nfew seconds. Then she turns her back upon me and awkwardly ascends the\r\ninclined plane, to reach the dim heights of her gallery. I give a\r\nglance at the work, take note of its shape and its position, and once\r\nmore restore darkness with the cardboard sheath. Let us not prolong our\r\nintrusion, if we would renew the test.\r\n\r\nMy sudden, short visit gives us some idea of the mysterious work. The\r\nball, which at first was absolutely spherical, is now depressed at the\r\ntop into a sort of shallow crater with a swollen rim. The thing reminds\r\nme, on a very much smaller scale, of certain prehistoric pots, with a\r\nround belly, a thick-lipped mouth and a narrow groove round the neck.\r\nThis rough model of the future pear tells us of the insect’s method, a\r\nmethod identical with that of pleistocene man ignorant of the potter’s\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nThe plastic ball, ringed at one end, has had a groove made in it, the\r\nstarting-point of the neck of the pear; it has also been drawn out\r\nslightly into a rather blunt projection. In the centre of this\r\nprojection pressure has been applied. The first stage of the work\r\ntherefore consists merely in placing a ring round the ball and applying\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nTowards evening I pay another sudden visit, in complete silence. The\r\ninsect has recovered from its excitement of the morning and gone down\r\nagain to its workshop. Troubled by the flood of light, baffled by the\r\nstrange events to which my artifices give rise, it at once makes off\r\nand takes refuge in the upper story. The poor mother, persecuted by\r\nthese illuminations, moves away into the darkest recesses; but she goes\r\nregretfully, with hesitating steps.\r\n\r\nThe work has progressed. The crater has become deeper; its thick lips\r\nhave disappeared, are thinner, closer together, drawn out into the neck\r\nof a pear. The object, however, has not changed its place. Its position\r\nand direction are exactly as I noted them before. The side that rested\r\non the ground is still at the bottom, at the same point; the side that\r\nfaced upwards is still at the top; the crater that lay on my right has\r\nbeen replaced by the neck, still on my right. All of which gives\r\nconclusive proof of my earlier statements: there is no rolling, but\r\nonly pressure, which kneads and shapes.\r\n\r\nThe next day, a third visit. The pear is finished. Its neck, yesterday\r\na yawning sack, is now closed. The egg, therefore, is laid; the work is\r\ncompleted and demands only the finishing touches of general polishing,\r\ntouches upon which the mother, so intent on geometrical perfection, was\r\ndoubtless engaged at the time when I disturbed her.\r\n\r\nThe most delicate part of the business escapes my observation. Roughly\r\nspeaking, I can see plainly how the egg’s hatching-chamber is obtained:\r\nthe thick pad surrounding the original crater is thinned and flattened\r\nunder the pressure of the feet and is lengthened into a sack the mouth\r\nof which gradually narrows. Up to this point the work provides its own\r\nexplanation. But, when we think of the insect’s rigid tools, its broad,\r\ntoothed fore-arms, whose spasmodic movements remind us of the stiff\r\ngestures of an automaton, we are left without any explanation of the\r\nexquisite perfection of the cell which is to be the hatching-chamber of\r\nthe egg.\r\n\r\nWith this crude equipment, excellently adapted to pickaxe-work though\r\nit be, how does the Scarab obtain the natal dwelling, the oval nest so\r\ndaintily polished and glazed within? Does her foot, a regular saw,\r\nfitted with enormous teeth, begin to rival the artist’s brush in\r\ndelicacy from the moment when it is inserted through the narrow orifice\r\nof the sack? Why not? I have said elsewhere, and this is the moment to\r\nsay it again: the tool does not make the workman. The insect exercises\r\nits own particular talents with any kind of tool with which it is\r\nsupplied. It can saw with a plane or plane with a saw, like the model\r\nworkman of whom Franklin tells us. The same strong-toothed rake which\r\nthe Sacred Beetle uses to open up the earth she also employs as a\r\ntrowel and brush wherewith to glaze the stucco of the chamber in which\r\nthe grub will be born.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, one more detail concerning this hatching-chamber. At the\r\nextreme end of the neck of the pear, one point is always pretty clearly\r\ndistinguished: it bristles with stringy fibres, while the rest of the\r\nneck is carefully polished. This is the plug with which the mother has\r\nclosed the narrow opening after carefully depositing the egg; and this\r\nplug, as its hairy structure shows, has not been subjected to the\r\npressure exerted over all the rest of the mass, working into it any\r\nprojecting bits, however small, till not the slightest sign of\r\nroughness remains.\r\n\r\nWhy does the extreme end of the pear receive this special treatment, a\r\nmost curious exception, when nothing else has eluded the heavy blows of\r\nthe insect’s legs? The reason is that the hind-end of the egg rests\r\nagainst this plug, which, were it pressed down and driven in, would\r\ntransmit the pressure to the germ and imperil its safety. So the\r\nmother, aware of the risk, stops the hole without ramming down the\r\nstopper: the air in the hatching-chamber is thus more easily renewed;\r\nand the egg escapes the dangerous activity of the powerful rammer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED BEETLE: THE LARVA\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the thin ceiling of the burrow, the Sacred Beetle’s egg undergoes\r\nthe varying influences of the sun, the supreme incubator. Consequently\r\nthere is not, nor can there be, any fixed date for the quickening of\r\nthe germ. In very hot, sunny weather, I have obtained a grub five or\r\nsix days after the egg was laid; with a more moderate temperature, I\r\nhave had to wait until the twelfth day. June and July are the\r\nhatching-months.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new-born grub has flung aside its swaddling clothes, it\r\nforthwith bites into the walls of its chamber. If starts eating its\r\nhouse, not anyhow, but with unerring wisdom. If it nibbled at the thin\r\nside of its cell—and there is nothing to dissuade it, for here as\r\nelsewhere the materials are of excellent quality—if its mandibles\r\nscraped the extreme end of the nipple, the weakest point, it would make\r\na breach in the protecting wall before it had sufficient putty to\r\nrepair that breach. This putty is the material which we shall see the\r\nlarva using later, when accidents of that kind occur from external\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nIf it ate into its heap of provisions at random, it would expose itself\r\nto serious risks from the outside; at the very least it would be liable\r\nto slip out of its cradle and tumble to the ground through the open\r\nwindow. Once it falls out of its cell, there is no hope for the little\r\ngrub. It will not know how to make its way back to the larder; and, if\r\nit does find its heap of provisions again, it will be repelled by the\r\nhard rind with its bits of grit and sand. In its wisdom, greater than\r\nany possessed by the young of the higher animals, which are always\r\nwatched over by a mother, the new-born larva, still sleek and shiny\r\nwith the slime of the egg, thoroughly knows the danger and avoids it by\r\nmasterly tactics.\r\n\r\nThough all the food around it is alike and all is to its taste,\r\nnevertheless it tackles exclusively the floor of its cell, a floor\r\ncontinued by the bulky sphere in which bites will be permissible in\r\nevery direction, as the consumer pleases.\r\n\r\nCan any one explain why this particular spot is chosen as the\r\nstarting-point, when there is nothing to distinguish it, from the point\r\nof view of food? Could the tiny creature be warned of the proximity of\r\nthe outer air by the effect which a thin wall has on its sensitive\r\nskin? If so, how is this effect produced? Besides, what does a grub,\r\nthat moment born, know of outside dangers? I am quite in the dark.\r\n\r\nOr rather I begin to see daylight. I recognize once again, under\r\nanother aspect, what was taught me some years ago by the Scolia-wasps\r\n[22] and the Sphex-wasps, [23] those scientific eaters, those skilful\r\nanatomists, who can discriminate so well between the lawful and the\r\nunlawful and are consequently able to devour their prey without killing\r\nit until the end of the meal. The Sacred Beetle has his own complicated\r\nart of eating. Though he need not trouble about the preservation of the\r\nvictuals, which are not liable to go bad, he has nevertheless to guard\r\nagainst ill-timed mouthfuls, which would rob him of his shelter. Of\r\nthese dangerous mouthfuls, the earliest are the most to be feared,\r\nbecause of the creature’s weakness and the thinness of the wall. As its\r\nprotection, therefore, the grub has, in its own way, the primal\r\ninspiration without which none would be able to live; it obeys the\r\nimperious voice of instinct, which says:\r\n\r\n‘There shalt thou bite and no elsewhere.’\r\n\r\nAnd, respecting all the rest, however tempting, it bites at the\r\nprescribed spot; it eats into the pear at the bottom of the neck. In a\r\nfew days it has worked its way deep down into the mass, where it waxes\r\nbig and fat, transforming the filthy material into a plump larva\r\ngleaming with health, ivory-white with slate-coloured reflections and\r\nwithout a speck of dirt upon it. The matter which has disappeared, or\r\nrather which has been remelted in life’s crucible, leaves empty a round\r\ncell into which the grub fits itself, curving its back under the\r\nspherical dome and bending double.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for a sight stranger than any yet displayed to me by\r\nthe industrial prowess of an insect. Anxious to observe the grub in the\r\nintimacy of its home, I open in the belly of the pear a little\r\npeep-hole half a centimetre [24] square. The head of the recluse at\r\nonce appears in the opening, to enquire what is happening. The breach\r\nis perceived. The head disappears. I can just see the white back\r\nturning about in the narrow cabin; and, then and there, the window\r\nwhich I have made is closed with a soft, brown paste, which soon\r\nhardens.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the cabin, said I to myself, is no doubt a semifluid\r\nporridge. Turning round, as is shown by the sudden slide of its back,\r\nthe grub has collected a handful of this material and, completing the\r\ncircuit, has stuck its load, by way of mortar, in the breach which it\r\nconsidered dangerous. I remove the plug. The grub acts as before, puts\r\nits head at the window, withdraws it, spins round as easily as a nut in\r\nits shell and forthwith produces a second plug as ample as the first.\r\nForewarned of what was coming, this time I saw more clearly.\r\n\r\nWhat a mistake I had made! However, I am not so much startled as I\r\nmight be: in the art of defence, animals often employ means which our\r\nimagination would not dare to contemplate. It is not the grub’s head\r\nthat is presented at the breach, after the preliminary twisting: it is\r\nthe other extremity. It does not bring a lump of its alimentary dough,\r\ngathered by scraping the walls: it excretes upon the aperture to be\r\nclosed, which is a much more economical proceeding. Sparingly measured\r\nout, the rations must not be wasted: there is just enough to live upon.\r\nBesides, the cement is of better quality; it soon sets. Lastly, the\r\nurgent repairs are more quickly effected if the intestines lend their\r\nkindly aid.\r\n\r\nThey do, in point of fact, and to an astonishing degree. Five, six\r\ntimes in succession and oftener, I remove the plug; and, time after\r\ntime, the mortar ejects a copious discharge from its apparently\r\ninexhaustible reservoir, which is ever at the mason’s service, without\r\nan interval for rest. The grub is already beginning to resemble the\r\nSacred Beetle, whose stercoraceous prowess we know: it is a past master\r\nin the art of dunging. It possesses above any other animal in the world\r\nan intestinal docility which anatomy presently will undertake to\r\nexplain to us in part.\r\n\r\nThe plasterer and the mason have their trowels. In the same way, the\r\ngrub, that zealous repairer of breaches made in its home, has a trowel\r\nof its own. The last segment is lopped off slantwise and carries on its\r\ndorsal surface a sort of inclined plane, a broad disk surrounded by a\r\nfleshy pad. In the middle of the disk is a slit, forming the\r\ncementing-aperture. There you have your trowel, a most respectable one,\r\nflattened out and supplied with a rim to prevent the compressed matter\r\nfrom flowing away uselessly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the mass of plastic matter has been emitted, the levelling-\r\nand compressing-instrument sets to work to introduce the cement well\r\ninto the irregularities of the breach, to push it right through the\r\nthickness of the ruined portion, to give it consistency and smooth it.\r\nAfter this trowel-work, the grub turns round: it comes and finishes the\r\njob with its wide forehead and improves it with the tip of its\r\nmandibles. Wait a quarter of an hour; and the repaired portion will be\r\nas firm as the rest of the shell, so quickly does the cement set.\r\nOutside, the repairs are betrayed by the irregular projections where\r\nthe stuff has been forced out, the part which the trowel could not\r\nreach; but, inside, there is no trace of the breakage: the usual polish\r\nhas been restored at the damaged spot. A plasterer stopping a hole in\r\none of our walls could produce no better piece of work.\r\n\r\nNor do the grub’s talents end here. With its cement it becomes the\r\nmender of pots and pans. Let me explain. I have compared the outside of\r\nthe pear, which, when pressed and dried, becomes a stout shell, with a\r\njar containing fresh food. In the course of my excavations, sometimes\r\nmade on difficult soil, I have happened occasionally to break this jar\r\nwith an ill-directed blow of my trowel. I have collected the potsherds,\r\npieced them together, after restoring the grub to its place, and kept\r\nthe whole thing united by wrapping it in a scrap of newspaper.\r\n\r\nOn reaching home, I have found the pear put out of shape, no doubt, and\r\nseamed with scars, but just as solid as ever. During the walk, the grub\r\nhad restored its ruined dwelling to condition. Cement injected into the\r\ncracks joined the pieces; inside, a thick plastering strengthened the\r\ninner wall, so much so that the repaired shell was quite as good as the\r\nuntouched shell, except for the irregularity of the outside. In its\r\nartistically-mended stronghold the grub found the peace essential to\r\nits existence.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to ask ourselves the reason for this plasterer’s\r\ncraft. Destined to live in complete darkness, does the larva stop the\r\ncracks made in its house in order to avoid the unwelcome intrusion of\r\nthe light? But it is blind. There is no trace of an organ of sight on\r\nits yellowish headpiece. The absence of eyes, however, does not\r\nauthorize us to deny the influence of the light, an influence which\r\nperhaps is vaguely resented by the grub’s delicate skin. Proofs are\r\nrequired. Here they are.\r\n\r\nI manage to make my breach almost in the dark. The little light that\r\nremains is just sufficient to guide my house-breaking-implement. When\r\nthe opening is made, I at once lower the shell into a dark box. A few\r\nminutes later, the hole is stopped. Despite the darkness in which it\r\nfound itself, the grub has thought fit to seal up its cell.\r\n\r\nIn small jars packed full of provisions, I bring up larvæ taken from\r\ntheir native pear. A pit is dug in the mass of foodstuffs, ending at\r\nthe bottom in a hemisphere. This cavity, representing about the half of\r\nthe pear, will be the artificial cell given in exchange for the natural\r\none. I put the grubs on which I am experimenting into separate cells.\r\nThe change of residence produces no appreciable anxiety. Finding the\r\nfood of my selecting very much to their taste, they bite into the walls\r\nwith their customary appetite. Exile in no way perturbs those stoical\r\nstomachs; and my attempts at breeding are pursued unchecked.\r\n\r\nA remarkable thing now happens. All my transplanted ones work little by\r\nlittle to complete the round nest of which my pit represented only the\r\nlower half. I have provided the flooring. They propose to add a\r\nceiling, a dome, and thus to shut themselves up in a spherical\r\nenclosure. The materials are the putty supplied by the intestines; the\r\nbuilding-tool is the trowel, the inclined plane of the final segment.\r\nSoft bricks are laid on the margin of the well. When these have set,\r\nthey serve as a support for a second row, sloping slightly inwards.\r\nOther rows follow, marking the curve of the general structure more and\r\nmore distinctly. Also, from time to time, a wriggle of the hinder part\r\nassists in determining the spherical conformation. In this way, without\r\nany supporting scaffold, without the cradle indispensable to our\r\narchitects in building an arched roof, a commanding dome is obtained,\r\nbuilt upon space and completing the sphere which I began.\r\n\r\nSome of them shorten the work. The glass wall of the little jar\r\noccasionally comes within range. Its smooth surface suits the taste of\r\nthese fastidious polishers; its curve, to a certain extent, coincides\r\nwith that of their plan. They make use of it, doubtless not from\r\neconomy of labour and time, but because, to their mind, the smooth\r\nround wall is a thing of their own making. In this way there is\r\nreserved, on the sides of the cupola, a large glazed window which\r\nanswers my purpose admirably.\r\n\r\nWell, the grubs which, all day long and for weeks on end, receive the\r\nbright light of my study through this window of mine keep as quiet as\r\nthe others, eating and digesting, and never trouble to shut out any\r\nunwelcome rays with a blind made of their putty. We may take it\r\ntherefore that, when the larva so eagerly closes the breach which I\r\nhave made in its chamber, its object is not to protect itself from the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nDoes it fear draughts then, when it scrupulously fills up the least\r\ncranny through which the air might enter? This again is not the\r\nsolution. The temperature is the same in my room and in the grub’s;\r\nbesides, when I perpetrate my burglaries, the atmosphere in my study is\r\nabsolutely still. I do not examine the prisoner in a gale, but in the\r\ncalm of my workroom, in the even profounder calm of a glass jar.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question of a cold breeze, which would be painful to a\r\nvery sensitive skin; and nevertheless the air is the enemy to be\r\navoided at all costs. If it flowed in at all plentifully through a\r\nbreach, with the dryness which the July heat imparts to it, the\r\nprovisions would be dried up. Faced with an uneatable biscuit, the grub\r\nwould become languid and anæmic and would soon perish of hunger. The\r\nmother, to the best of her abilities, has guarded her offspring against\r\ndeath from starvation by making her pear round and giving it a stout\r\nrind; but, for all that, her children are not released from every\r\nobligation to watch their rations. If they want bread that keeps soft\r\nand fresh to the last, they must in their turn see to it that the\r\nprovision-jar is properly closed. Crevices may appear, fraught with\r\ngrave danger. It is important to stop them up without delay. This, if I\r\nbe not utterly at fault, is the reason why the grub is a plasterer\r\narmed with a trowel and provided with a workshop that can always\r\nfurnish plenty of putty. The pot-mender repairs his cracked jar in\r\norder to keep his bread nice and soft.\r\n\r\nA serious objection suggests itself. The slits, the breaches, the\r\nvent-holes which I see so zealously cemented are the work of my\r\ninstruments: tweezers, penknife, dissecting-needles. It cannot be\r\nmaintained that the grub is endowed with its strange talent to protect\r\nitself against the troubles brought upon it by human curiosity. What\r\nhas it to fear from man, in its life underground? Nothing, or next to\r\nnothing. Since the Sacred Beetle started rolling his ball under the\r\nbroad canopy of the sky, I am probably the first to worry his family in\r\norder to make them talk to me and instruct me. Others will come after\r\nme perhaps; but they will be very few! No, man’s destructive\r\ninterference is not worth the pains of providing one’s self with a\r\ntrowel and cement. Then why this art of stopping crevices?\r\n\r\nWait. In its apparently peaceful home, in its round shell which seems\r\nto give it such perfect security, the grub nevertheless has its\r\ntroubles. Which of us has not, from the greatest to the smallest? They\r\nbegin at birth. Though I have only touched the fringe of the matter, I\r\nam already aware of three or four sorts of grievous accidents to which\r\nthe Sacred Beetle’s larva is liable. Plants, animals, blind physical\r\nforces, all work its ruin by destroying its larder.\r\n\r\nCompetition is rife around the cake served up by the Sheep. When the\r\nmother Scarab arrives to take her share and manufacture her pill, the\r\nbit is often at the mercy of fellow-banqueters of whom the smallest are\r\nthe most to be dreaded. There are especially little Onthophagi, earnest\r\nworkers crouching under the shelter of the cake. Some prefer to plunge\r\ninto the richest part and bury themselves ecstatically in its luscious\r\ndepths. One of these is Schreber’s Onthophagus, who is a shiny\r\nebon-black, with four red spots on his wing-cases. Another is the\r\nsmallest of our Aphodii (Aphodius pusillus, Herbst), who confides her\r\neggs, here and there, to the thick part of the cake. In her hurry, the\r\nmother Scarab does not examine her harvest very carefully. While some\r\nof the Onthophagi are removed, others, buried in the centre of the\r\nmass, escape notice. Besides, the Aphodius’ eggs are so small that they\r\nelude her vigilance. In this way a contaminated lump of paste is taken\r\ninto the burrow and moulded.\r\n\r\nThe pears in our gardens suffer from vermin which disfigure them with\r\nscars. The Sacred Beetle’s pears suffer even worse ravages. The\r\nOnthophagus shut in by accident ferrets about and pulls them to pieces.\r\nWhen, filled to repletion, the glutton wishes to make his exit, he\r\npierces them with circular holes large enough to admit a lead-pencil.\r\nThe evil is worse still with the Aphodius, whose family hatch, develop\r\nand undergo their transformation in the very heart of the provisions.\r\nMy notes contain descriptions of pears perforated in every direction,\r\nriddled with a multitude of holes that serve for the escape of the tiny\r\ndung-worker, a parasite in spite of himself.\r\n\r\nWith table-fellows such as these, who bore ventilating-shafts in the\r\nprovisions, the Sacred Beetle’s grub dies if the miners be numerous.\r\nIts trowel and mortar cannot cope with so great a task. They can cope\r\nwith it if the damage be slight and the intruders few. At once stopping\r\nup every passage that opens around it, the grub holds its own against\r\nthe invader; it disgruntles him and drives him away. The pear is saved\r\nand preserved from internal desiccation.\r\n\r\nVarious Cryptogamia have a finger in the pie. They invade the fertile\r\nsoil of the pill, make it rise in scales, split it with fissures by\r\nimplanting their pustules. In its shell cracked by this vegetation, the\r\ngrub would die were it not for the safeguard of its mortar, which puts\r\nan end to these desiccating vent-holes.\r\n\r\nIt puts an end to them in a third case, the most frequent of all.\r\nWithout the intervention of any ravager, whether animal or plant, the\r\npear pretty often peels of its own accord, swells and tears. Is this\r\ndue to a reaction in the outer layer, which was too tightly pressed by\r\nthe mother when modelling? Is it due to an attempt at fermentation? Or\r\nis it not rather the result of a contraction similar to that of clay,\r\nwhich splits in drying? All three causes might very well play their\r\npart.\r\n\r\nBut, without saying anything positive on this point, I will draw\r\nattention to certain deep fissures which seem to threaten the soft\r\nbread with desiccation, inadequately protected as it is by the cracked\r\njar. Have no fear that these spontaneous breaches will do any harm: the\r\nlarva will soon put them right. In the distribution of gifts, it was\r\nnot for nothing that the trowel and putty were awarded to the Sacred\r\nBeetle’s grub.\r\n\r\nWe will now give a brief description of the larva, without stopping to\r\nenumerate the articulations of the palpi and antennæ, which are\r\nwearisome details of no immediate interest. It is a fat grub and has a\r\nfine, white skin, with pale slate-coloured reflections proceeding from\r\nthe digestive organs, which are visible when you hold the creature to\r\nthe light. Bent into a broken arch or hook, it is not unlike the grub\r\nof the Cockchafer, but has a much more ungainly figure, for, on its\r\nback, at the sudden bend of the hook, the third, fourth and fifth\r\nsegments of the abdomen swell into an enormous hump, a tumour, a bag so\r\nprominent that the skin seems on the point of bursting under the\r\npressure of the contents. This is the animal’s most striking feature:\r\nthe fact that it carries a knapsack.\r\n\r\nThe head is small, in proportion to the grub’s size, is slightly\r\nconvex, bright-red and studded with a few pale bristles. The legs are\r\nfairly long and sturdy, ending in a pointed tarsus. The grub does not\r\nuse them as a means of progression. When taken from its shell and\r\nplaced upon the table, it struggles in clumsy contortions without\r\nsucceeding in shifting its position; and the helpless creature betrays\r\nits anxiety by repeated discharges of its mortar.\r\n\r\nLet us also mention the terminal trowel, that last segment lopped into\r\na slanting disk and rimmed with a fleshy pad. In the centre of this\r\ninclined plane is the open stercoraceous slit, which thus, by a very\r\nunusual inversion, occupies the upper surface. A huge hump and a\r\ntrowel: that gives you the insect in two words.\r\n\r\nIn his Histoire naturelle des coléoptères de France, Mulsant describes\r\nthe larva of the Sacred Beetle. He tells us with meticulous detail the\r\nnumber and shape of the joints of the palpi and antennæ; he sees the\r\nhypopygium [25] and its pointed bristles; he sees a multitude of things\r\nin the domain of the microscope; and he does not see the monstrous\r\nknapsack that takes up almost half the insect, nor does he see the\r\nstrange configuration of the last segment. There is not a doubt in my\r\nmind that the writer of this minute description has made a mistake: the\r\nlarva of which he speaks is nothing like that of the Sacred Beetle.\r\n\r\nWe must not finish the history of the grub without saying a few words\r\nabout its internal structure. Anatomy will show us the works wherein\r\nthe cement employed in so eccentric a manner is manufactured. The\r\nstomach or chylific ventricle is a long, thick cylinder, starting from\r\nthe creature’s neck after a very short œsophagus. It measures about\r\nthree times the insect’s length. In its last quarter, it carries a\r\nvoluminous lateral pocket distended by the food. This is a subsidiary\r\nstomach in which the supplies are stored so as to yield their nutritive\r\nprinciples more thoroughly. The chylific ventricle is much too long to\r\nlie straight and twists round in front of its appendix, in the form of\r\na large loop occupying the dorsal surface. It is to contain this loop\r\nand the side-pocket that the back swells into a hump. The grub’s\r\nknapsack is, therefore, a second paunch, an annexe, as it were, of the\r\nstomach, which is by itself incapable of holding the voluminous\r\ndigestive apparatus. Four very fine, very long tubular glands, very\r\nmuch entangled, four Malpighian vessels mark the limits of the chylific\r\nventricle.\r\n\r\nNext comes the intestine, which is narrow and cylindrical and rises in\r\nfront. The intestine is followed by the rectum, which pushes backwards.\r\nThis last, which is exceptionally large and furnished with stout walls,\r\nis wrinkled across, bloated and distended with its contents. There you\r\nhave the roomy warehouse in which the digestive refuse accumulates;\r\nthere you have the mighty ejaculator, ever ready to provide cement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED BEETLE: THE NYMPH; THE RELEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe larva increases in bulk as it eats the walls of its house from the\r\ninside. Little by little, the belly of the pear is scooped out into a\r\ncell whose capacity grows in proportion to the growth of its\r\ninhabitant. Ensconced in its hermitage, supplied with board and\r\nlodging, the recluse waxes big and fat. What more is wanted? Certain\r\nhygienic duties have to be attended to, though it is no easy matter in\r\na cramped little niche nearly all the room in which is occupied by the\r\ngrub; the mortar incessantly elaborated by an excessively obliging\r\nintestine must be shot somewhere when there is no breach that needs\r\nrepairing.\r\n\r\nThe larva is certainly not fastidious, but even so the bill of fare\r\nmust not be too outrageous. The humblest of the humble does not return\r\nto what he or his kin have already digested. Matter from which the\r\nintestinal alembic has extracted the last available atom yields nothing\r\nmore, unless we change both chemist and apparatus. What the Sheep, with\r\nher fourfold stomach, has left behind as worthless residue is an\r\nexcellent thing for the grub, which also boasts a mighty paunch; but\r\nthe larva’s own droppings, though no doubt pleasing in their turn to\r\nconsumers of another class, are loathsome to the grub itself. Then\r\nwhere shall the cumbrous refuse be stored, in a lodging of such\r\nniggardly dimensions?\r\n\r\nI have described elsewhere the singular industry of the Cotton-bees,\r\n[26] whose larvæ, in order not to foul their provision of honey, make\r\nfrom their digestive dregs an elegant casket, a masterpiece of inlaid\r\nwork. With the only material at its disposal in its secluded retreat,\r\nwith the filth that apparently ought to be an intolerable nuisance, the\r\ngrub of the Sacred Beetle produces a work less artistic than the\r\nCotton-bee’s but much more comfortable. Let us see how it is done.\r\n\r\nAttacking its pear at the bottom of the neck, eating steadily downwards\r\nand leaving nothing intact in its area of operations except a flimsy\r\nwall necessary for its protection, the larva obtains a free space at\r\nthe back, in which its droppings are deposited without dirtying the\r\nprovisions. The hatching-chamber is the first to be filled up in this\r\nway; then gradually more and more of the segment which has been eaten\r\ninto follows suit, always in the round part of the pear, which\r\nconsequently by degrees recovers its original compactness at the top,\r\nwhile the bottom becomes less and less thick. Behind the grub is the\r\never-increasing mass of used material; in front of it is the layer,\r\nsmaller day by day, of untouched food.\r\n\r\nComplete development is attained in four or five weeks. By that time\r\nthere is in the belly of the pear an eccentric circular cavity, with\r\nwalls very thick towards the neck of the pear and very flimsy at the\r\nother end, the disparity being occasioned by the method of eating and\r\nof progressive filling up. The meal is over. Next comes the furnishing\r\nof the cell, which must be padded snugly for the tender body of the\r\nnymph, and the strengthening of one of the hemispheres, the one whose\r\nwalls have been scraped by the last bites to the utmost permissible\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\nFor this most important work the larva has wisely reserved a plentiful\r\nstock of cement. The trowel therefore begins to be busy. This time, the\r\nobject is not to repair damage; it is to double and treble the\r\nthickness of the wall in the weaker hemisphere and to cover the whole\r\nsurface with stucco which, after being polished by the movements of the\r\ngrub’s body, will be soft to the touch. As this cement acquires a\r\nconsistency superior to that of the original materials, the grub is at\r\nlast contained within a stout casket which defies all efforts to open\r\nit with one’s fingers and is almost capable of withstanding a blow from\r\na stone.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is ready. The grub sheds its skin and becomes a nymph.\r\nThere are very few inhabitants of the insect world that can compare for\r\nsober beauty with the delicate creature which, with wing-cases\r\nrecumbent in front of it like a wide-pleated scarf and fore-legs folded\r\nunder its head like those of the adult Beetle when counterfeiting\r\ndeath, calls to mind a mummy kept by its linen bandages in the approved\r\nhieratic attitude. Semitranslucent and honey-yellow, it looks as though\r\nit were carved from a block of amber. Imagine it hardened in this\r\nstate, mineralized, rendered incorruptible: it would make a splendid\r\ntopaz gem.\r\n\r\nIn this marvel of beauty, so severe and dignified in shape and\r\ncolouring, one point above all captivates me and at last provides me\r\nwith the solution of a far-reaching problem. Have the fore-legs a\r\ntarsus, yes or no? This is the great matter that makes me neglect the\r\njewel for the sake of a structural detail. Let us then return to a\r\nsubject that used to excite me in my early days, for the answer has\r\ncome at last, late, it is true, but certain and indisputable. The\r\nprobabilities which were all that my first investigations could give me\r\nturn into certainties established by overwhelming evidence.\r\n\r\nBy a very strange exception, the full-grown Sacred Beetle and his\r\ncongeners have no front tarsi: they lack on their fore-limbs the\r\nfive-jointed finger which is the rule among the highest section of\r\nBeetles, the Pentamera. The remaining legs, on the other hand, follow\r\nthe general law and possess a very well-shaped tarsus. Does this\r\ncurious formation of the toothed fore-arms date from birth, or is it\r\naccidental?\r\n\r\nAt first sight, an accident seems not unlikely. The Sacred Beetle is a\r\nstrenuous miner and a great pedestrian. Always in contact with the\r\nrough soil, whether in walking or digging, used moreover for constant\r\nleverage when the insect is rolling its pill backwards, the front limbs\r\nare exposed much more freely than the others to the danger of spraining\r\nand twisting their delicate finger, of putting it out of joint, of\r\nlosing it entirely, from the first moment when the work begins.\r\n\r\nLest this explanation should appeal to any of my readers, I will hasten\r\nto undeceive him. The absence of the front fingers is not the result of\r\nan accident. Here before my eyes lies the unanswerable proof. I examine\r\nthe nymph’s legs with the magnifying glass: those in front have not the\r\nleast vestige of a tarsus; the toothed limb ends bluntly, without any\r\ntrace of a terminal appendage. In the others, on the contrary, the\r\ntarsus is as distinct as can be, notwithstanding the shapeless, lumpy\r\ncondition due to the swaddling-bands and humours of the nymphal state.\r\nIt suggests a finger swollen with chilblains.\r\n\r\nIf the evidence of the nymph were not sufficient, there would still be\r\nthat of the perfect insect, which, casting its mummy-cloths and moving\r\nfor the first time in its shell, wields fingerless fore-arms. The point\r\nis established for a certainty: the Sacred Beetle is born maimed; his\r\nmutilation dates from the beginning.\r\n\r\n‘Very well,’ our popular theorists will reply, ‘the Sacred Beetle is\r\nmutilated from birth; but his remote ancestors were not. Formed\r\naccording to the general rule, they were correct in structure down to\r\nthis tiny digital detail. There were some who, in their rough work as\r\nnavvies and carters, wore out that fragile, useless member which was\r\nalways in the way; and, finding themselves all the better equipped for\r\ntheir work by this accidental amputation, they bequeathed it to their\r\nsuccessors, to the great benefit of their race. The present insect\r\nprofits by the improvement obtained by a long array of ancestors and,\r\nacting under the stimulus of the struggle for life, gives more and more\r\ndurability to a favourable condition due to chance.’\r\n\r\nO ingenious theorists, so triumphant on paper, so impotent in the face\r\nof facts, just listen to me for a moment! If the loss of the front\r\nfingers is a fortunate circumstance for the Sacred Beetle, who\r\nfaithfully transmits the leg of olden time fortuitously maimed, why\r\nshould it not be so with the other limbs, if they too chanced to lose\r\ntheir terminal appendage, a tiny, feeble filament, which is very nearly\r\nuseless and which, owing to its fragility, is a cause of awkward\r\nencounters with the roughness of the soil?\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Beetle is not a climber; he is an ordinary pedestrian,\r\nsupporting himself upon the point of an iron-shod stick, whereby I mean\r\nthe stout spike or prickle with which the tip of his leg is armed. He\r\nhas no occasion to hold on by his claws to some hanging branch, as the\r\nCockchafer does. It would therefore, meseems, be entirely to his\r\nadvantage to rid himself of the four remaining digits, which jut out\r\nsideways, give no help in walking, and do not play any part in the\r\nmaking and the carting of the ball. Yes, that would mean progress, for\r\nthe simple reason that the less hold you give the enemy the better. It\r\nremains to be seen if chance ever produces this state of things.\r\n\r\nIt does and very often. At the end of the fine weather, in October,\r\nwhen the insect has worn itself out in digging, in trundling pills and\r\nin modelling pears, the maimed, disabled by their exertions, form the\r\ngreat majority. Both in my cages and out of doors, I see them in all\r\nstages of mutilation. Some have lost the finger on their four\r\nhind-limbs altogether; others retain a stump, a couple of joints, a\r\nsingle joint; those least damaged have a few members left intact.\r\n\r\nHere then is the mutilation on which the philosophers base their\r\ntheory. And it is no rare accident: every year the cripples outnumber\r\nthe others when the time comes for retiring to winter-quarters. In\r\ntheir final labours they seem no more embarrassed than those who have\r\nbeen spared by the buffeting of life. On both sides I find the same\r\nnimbleness of movement, the same dexterity in kneading the reserve of\r\nbread which will enable them to bear the first rigours of winter with\r\nequanimity in their underground homes. In scavenger’s work, the maimed\r\nrival the others.\r\n\r\nAnd these cripples found families: they spend the cold season beneath\r\nthe soil; they wake up in the spring, return to the surface and take\r\npart for a second time, sometimes even for a third, in life’s great\r\nfestival. Their descendants ought to profit by an improvement which has\r\nbeen renewed year by year, ever since Sacred Beetles came into the\r\nworld, and which has certainly had time to become fixed and to convert\r\nitself into a settled habit. But they do nothing of the sort. Every\r\nSacred Beetle that breaks his shell, with not one exception, is endowed\r\nwith the regulation four tarsi.\r\n\r\nWell, my theorists, what do you say to that? For the two front legs you\r\noffer a sort of explanation; and the four others give you a categorical\r\ndenial. Have you not been taking your fancies for facts?\r\n\r\nThen what is the cause of the Sacred Beetle’s original mutilation? I\r\nwill frankly confess that I have no idea. Nevertheless those two maimed\r\nmembers are very strange, so strange indeed that they have enticed the\r\nmasters, the greatest masters, into lamentable errors. Listen, first of\r\nall, to Latreille, [27] the prince of descriptive entomologists. In his\r\narticle on the insects which ancient Egypt painted or carved upon her\r\nmonuments, [28] he quotes the writings of Horapollo, [29] a unique\r\ndocument preserved for us in the papyri for the glorification of the\r\nsacred insect:\r\n\r\n\r\n   ‘One would be tempted at first,’ he says, ‘to set down as fiction\r\n    what Horapollo says of the number of this Beetle’s fingers:\r\n    according to him, there are thirty. Nevertheless, this computation,\r\n    judged by the way in which he looks at the tarsus, is quite\r\n    correct, for this part consists of five joints; and, if we take\r\n    each of them for a finger, the legs being six in number and each\r\n    ending in a five-jointed tarsus, the Sacred Beetles evidently had\r\n    thirty fingers.’\r\n\r\n\r\nForgive me, illustrious master: the number of joints is but twenty,\r\nbecause the two fore-legs are without tarsi. You were carried away by\r\nthe general rule. Losing sight of the singular exception, which you\r\ncertainly knew, you said thirty, obsessed for a moment by that\r\noverwhelmingly positive rule. Yes, you knew the exception, so much so\r\nthat the figure of the Scarab accompanying your article, a figure drawn\r\nfrom the insect and not from the Egyptian monuments, is irreproachably\r\naccurate: it has no tarsi on its front legs. The blunder is pardonable,\r\nbecause the exception is so unusual.\r\n\r\nMulsant, [30] in his volume on the French Lamellicorns, quotes\r\nHorapollo and his allowance of thirty fingers to the insect according\r\nto the number of days which the sun takes to traverse a sign of the\r\nZodiac. He repeats Latreille’s explanation. He goes even farther. Here\r\nare his own words:\r\n\r\n\r\n   ‘If we count each joint of the tarsi as a finger, we must admit\r\n    that this insect was examined with great attention.’\r\n\r\n\r\nExamined with great attention! By whom, pray? By Horapollo? Not a bit\r\nof it! By you, my master: yes, indeed yes! And yet the rule, in its\r\nvery positiveness, is misleading you for a moment; it misleads you\r\nagain and in a more serious fashion when, in your illustration of the\r\nSacred Beetle, you represent the insect with tarsi on its fore-legs,\r\ntarsi similar to those on the other legs. You, painstaking describer\r\nthough you be, have in your turn been the victim of a momentary\r\naberration. The rule is so general that it has made you lose sight of\r\nthe singularity of the exception.\r\n\r\nWhat did Horapollo himself see? Apparently what we see in our day. If\r\nLatreille’s explanation be right, as everything seems to indicate, if\r\nthe Egyptian author began by counting the first thirty fingers\r\naccording to the number of joints in the tarsi, it is because he made a\r\nmental enumeration on the basis of the general circumstances. He was\r\nguilty of a slip which was not so very reprehensible, seeing that, more\r\nthan a thousand years later, masters like Latreille and Mulsant were\r\nguilty of the same slip. If we must blame something, let us blame the\r\nexceptional structure of the insect.\r\n\r\n‘But,’ I may be asked, ‘why should not Horapollo have seen the exact\r\ntruth? Perhaps the Sacred Beetle of his day had tarsi which the insect\r\nno longer possesses. In that case, it has been transformed by the slow\r\nwork of time.’\r\n\r\nI am waiting for some one to show me a natural Scarab of Horapollo’s\r\nperiod before I reply to this objection on the part of the\r\nevolutionists. The tombs which so religiously guard the Cat, the Ibis\r\nand the Crocodile must also contain the sacred insect. All that I have\r\nby me is a few figures showing the Scarab as we find him engraved on\r\nthe monuments or carved in fine stone as an amulet for the mummies. The\r\nancient artist is remarkably faithful in the execution of the thing as\r\na whole; but his graver and chisel have not troubled about such\r\ninsignificant details as the tarsi.\r\n\r\nPoor as I am in documents of this kind, I doubt whether the work of\r\nsculptor or engraver will solve the problem. Even if an image with\r\nfront tarsi were discovered somewhere or other, the question would be\r\nno further advanced. It would always be possible to plead a mistake, an\r\noversight, a leaning towards symmetry. The doubt, so long as it\r\nprevails in certain minds, can be removed only by the sight of the\r\nancient insect in the natural state. I will wait for it, though\r\nconvinced beforehand that the Sacred Beetle of the Pharaohs differed in\r\nno way from our own.\r\n\r\nWe will stay a little longer with the old Egyptian author, though his\r\nwild allegorical jargon is usually incomprehensible. He is sometimes\r\nstrikingly accurate in his ideas. Is this due to a chance coincidence?\r\nOr is it the result of serious observation? I should be glad to take\r\nthe latter view, so perfect is the agreement between his statements and\r\ncertain biological details of which our own science was ignorant until\r\nquite lately. Of the home life of the Sacred Beetle Horapollo knew much\r\nmore than we do. He tells us this in particular:\r\n\r\n\r\n   ‘The Scarabæus deposits this ball in the earth for the space of\r\n    twenty-eight days (for in so many days the moon passes through the\r\n    twelve signs of the Zodiac). By thus remaining under the moon the\r\n    race of Scarabæi is endowed with life; and upon the twenty-ninth\r\n    day, after having opened the ball, it casts it into water, for it\r\n    is aware that upon that day the conjunction of the moon and sun\r\n    takes place, as well as the generation of the world. From the ball\r\n    thus opened, the animals, that is, the Scarabæi, issue forth.’ [31]\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us dismiss the revolution of the moon, the conjunction of the sun\r\nand moon, the generation of the world and other astrological\r\nabsurdities, but remember this, the twenty-eight days of incubation\r\nrequired by the ball underground, the twenty-eight days during which\r\nthe Scarab is born to life. Let us also remember the indispensable\r\nintervention of water to bring the insect out of its burst shell. These\r\nare definite facts, falling within the domain of true science. Are they\r\nimaginary or real? The question deserves investigation.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were unacquainted with the wonders of the metamorphosis.\r\nTo them a larva was a worm born of corruption. The wretched creature\r\nhad no future to lift it from its abject state: as worm it appeared and\r\nas worm it must disappear. It was not a mask whereunder a higher form\r\nof life was being elaborated; it was a definite entity, supremely\r\ncontemptible and doomed soon to return to the putrescence of which it\r\nwas the offspring.\r\n\r\nTo the Egyptian author, then, the Scarab’s larva was unknown. And, if\r\nby chance he had had before his eyes the insect’s shell inhabited by a\r\nfat, pot-bellied grub, he would never have suspected in the foul and\r\nugly animal the sober beauty of the future Scarab. According to the\r\nideas of the time, ideas that were long maintained, the sacred insect\r\nhad neither father nor mother: an error excusable among the untutored\r\nancients, for here the two sexes are outwardly indistinguishable. It\r\nwas born of the ordure that formed its ball; and its birth dated from\r\nthe appearance of the nymph, that amber jewel displaying, in a\r\nperfectly recognizable shape, the features of the adult insect.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of antiquity the life of the Sacred Beetle began at the\r\nmoment when he could be recognized, not before; for otherwise we should\r\nhave that as yet unsuspected connecting-link, the grub. The\r\ntwenty-eight days, therefore, during which, as Horapollo tells us, the\r\noffspring of the insect quickens, represent the duration of the nymphal\r\nphase. This duration has been the object of special attention in my\r\nstudies. It varies but never to any great extent. From my notes I find\r\nthirty-three days to be the longest period and twenty-one the shortest.\r\nThe average, supplied by some twenty observations, is twenty-eight\r\ndays. This very number twenty-eight, this number of days contained in\r\nfour weeks, actually appears oftener than the others. Horapollo spoke\r\ntruly: the real insect takes life in the space of a lunar month.\r\n\r\nThe four weeks passed, behold the Sacred Beetle in his final shape: the\r\nshape, yes, but not the colouring, which is very strange when the nymph\r\ncasts its skin. The head, legs and thorax are dark-red, except the\r\ndenticulations of the forehead and fore-arms, which are smoky-brown.\r\nThe abdomen is an opaque white; the wing-cases are semitransparent\r\nwhite, very faintly tinged with yellow. This imposing raiment, blending\r\nthe scarlet of the cardinal’s cassock with the white of the celebrant’s\r\nalb, a raiment that harmonizes with the insect’s hieratic character, is\r\nbut temporary and turns darker by degrees, to make way for a uniform of\r\nebon black. About a month is needed for the horny armour to acquire a\r\nfirm consistency and a definite hue.\r\n\r\nAt last the Beetle is fully matured. Awakening within him is the\r\ndelicious restlessness born of coming freedom. He, hitherto a son of\r\nthe darkness, foresees the gladness of the light. Great is his longing\r\nto burst the shell so that he may emerge from his underground prison\r\nand come into the sun; but the difficulty of liberating himself is no\r\nsmall one. Will he or will he not escape from the natal cradle, which\r\nhas now become a hateful dungeon? It depends.\r\n\r\nGenerally in August the Sacred Beetle is ripe for release: in August,\r\nsave for rare exceptions, the most torrid, dry and scorching month of\r\nthe year. If therefore no shower come from time to time to give some\r\nslight relief to the panting earth, then the cell to be burst and the\r\nwall to be breached defy the strength and patience of the insect, which\r\nis helpless against all that hardness. Owing to prolonged desiccation,\r\nthe soft original matter has become an insuperable rampart; it has\r\nturned into a sort of brick baked in the kiln of summer.\r\n\r\nI have, of course, made experiments on the insect in these difficult\r\ncircumstances. I gather pear-shaped shells containing the adult Beetle,\r\nwho is on the point of emerging, in view of the lateness of the season.\r\nThese shells are already dry and very hard; and I lay them in a box\r\nwhere they retain their dryness. Sooner or later I hear the sharp\r\ngrating of a rasp inside each cell. It is the prisoner working to make\r\nhimself an outlet by scraping the wall with the rake of his forehead\r\nand fore-feet. Two or three days elapse; and the process of deliverance\r\nseems to be no further advanced.\r\n\r\nI come to the assistance of a pair of them by myself opening a loophole\r\nwith a knife. My idea is that this first breach will help the egress of\r\nthe recluse by giving him a place to start upon, an exit that will only\r\nneed widening. But not at all: these favoured ones make no more\r\nprogress with their work than the others.\r\n\r\nIn less than a fortnight silence prevails in all the shells. The\r\nprisoners, worn out with vain endeavours, have perished. I break the\r\ncaskets containing the deceased. A meagre pinch of dust, hardly as much\r\nas an average pea in bulk, is all that those powerful implements, rasp,\r\nsaw, harrow and rake, have succeeded in detaching from the invincible\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nI take some other shells, of equal hardness, wrap them in a wet rag and\r\nput them in a flask. When the moisture has soaked through them, I rid\r\nthem of their wrapper and keep them in the corked flask. This time\r\nevents take a very different course. Softened to a nicety by the wet\r\nrag, the shells open, burst by the efforts of the prisoner, who props\r\nhimself boldly on his legs, using his back as a lever; or else, scraped\r\naway at one point, they crumble to pieces and reveal a yawning breach.\r\nThe experiment is a complete success. In every case the release of the\r\nBeetles is safely accomplished: a few drops of water have brought them\r\nthe joys of the sun.\r\n\r\nFor the second time Horapollo was right. True, it is not the mother, as\r\nthe ancient writer says, who throws her ball into the water: it is the\r\nclouds that provide the liberating douche, it is the rain that brings\r\nabout the ultimate release. In the natural state things must happen as\r\nin my experiments. When the soil is burnt by the August sun, the\r\nshells, baked like bricks under their thin covering of earth, are for\r\nmost of the time hard as stones. It is impossible for the insect to\r\nwear away its casket and escape. But let a shower come—that life-giving\r\nbaptism which the seed of the plant and the family of the Beetle alike\r\nawait within the cinders of the earth—let a little rain fall; and soon\r\nthere will be a resurrection in the fields.\r\n\r\nThe earth becomes soaked. There you have the wet rag of my experiment.\r\nAt its touch the shell recovers the softness of its early days, the\r\ncasket becomes yielding; the insect makes play with its legs and pushes\r\nwith its back; it is free. It is in fact in September, during the first\r\nrains that herald autumn, that the Sacred Beetle leaves his native\r\nburrow and comes forth to enliven the pastoral sward, even as the\r\nformer generation enlivened it in the spring. The clouds, hitherto so\r\nungenerous, at last set him free.\r\n\r\nWhen the earth is exceptionally cool, the bursting of the shell and the\r\ndeliverance of its occupant can occur at an earlier period; but in\r\nground scorched by the pitiless summer sun, as is usually the case in\r\nmy district, the Beetle, however eager he may be to see the light, must\r\nneeds wait for the first rain to soften his stubborn shell. A downpour\r\nis to him a question of life and death. Horapollo, that echo of the\r\nEgyptian magi, saw true when he made water play its part in the birth\r\nof the sacred insect.\r\n\r\nBut let us drop the jargon of antiquity, with its fragments of truth;\r\nlet us not overlook the first acts of the Scarab on leaving his shell;\r\nand let us be present at his prentice steps in open-air life. In August\r\nI break the casket in which I hear the helpless captive chafing. I\r\nplace the insect, the only one of its species, in a cage together with\r\nsome Gymnopleuri. There is plenty of fresh food provided. This is the\r\nmoment, said I to myself, when we take refreshment after so long an\r\nabstinence. Well, I was wrong: the new recruit shows no interest in the\r\nvictuals, notwithstanding my invitations, my summons to the tempting\r\nheap. What he wants above all is the joys of the light. He scales the\r\nmetal trelliswork, sets himself in the sun, and there motionless takes\r\nhis fill of its beams.\r\n\r\nWhat passes through his dull-witted Dung-beetle brain during this first\r\nbath of radiant brightness? Probably nothing. His is the unconscious\r\nhappiness of a flower blossoming in the sun.\r\n\r\nAt last the insect goes to the victuals. A pellet is made in accordance\r\nwith all the rules. There is no apprenticeship: at the first attempt,\r\nthe spherical form is achieved as accurately as after long practice. A\r\nburrow is dug in which the bread just kneaded may be eaten in peace.\r\nHere again we find the novice thoroughly versed in his art. No length\r\nof experience will add anything to his talents.\r\n\r\nHis digging-tools are his fore-legs and forehead. To shoot the rubbish\r\noutside, he uses the barrow, exactly like any of his elders, that is to\r\nsay, he covers his corselet with a load of earth; then, head downwards,\r\nhe dives into the dust, afterwards coming forward and depositing his\r\nload a few inches from the entrance. With a leisurely step, like that\r\nof a navvy with a long job before him, he goes underground again to\r\nreload his barrow. This work upon the dining-room takes whole hours to\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\nAt length the ball is stored away. The front-door is shut; and the\r\nthing is done. Bed and board secured, begone dull care! All is for the\r\nbest in the best of all possible worlds. Lucky creature! Without ever\r\nseeing it practised by your kindred, whom you have not yet met, without\r\never learning it, you know your trade to perfection; and it will give\r\nyou an ample share of food and tranquillity, both so hard to achieve in\r\nhuman life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE BROAD-NECKED SCARAB; THE GYMNOPLEURI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we have learnt from the Sacred Beetle must not lead us into rash\r\ngeneralizations and make us attribute it in every slightest detail to\r\nthe other Dung-beetles of the same family. Similarity of structure does\r\nnot entail parity of instincts. A common basis no doubt exists,\r\nresulting from identity of equipment; but many variations of the\r\nessential theme are possible and are dictated by inherent aptitudes of\r\nwhich the insect’s organization gives us no inkling. In fact, the study\r\nof these variations, of these peculiarities, with their hidden reasons,\r\nforms the most attractive part of the observer’s researches as he\r\nexplores his corner of the entomological domain. Unsparing of time and\r\npatience, sometimes of ingenuity, you have at last learnt what this one\r\ndoes. See now what that one does, his near neighbour structurally. To\r\nwhat extent does number two repeat the habits of number one? Has he\r\nways of his own, tricks of the trade, industrial specialities unknown\r\nto the other? It is a highly interesting problem, for the impassable\r\nline of demarcation between the two species is much more conspicuous in\r\nthese psychological differences than in the differences of the\r\nwing-case or antenna.\r\n\r\nThe Scarab clan is represented in my district by the Sacred Beetle\r\n(Scarabæus sacer, Lin.), the Half-spotted Scarab (S. semipunctatus,\r\nFab.) and the Broad-necked Scarab (S. laticollis, Lin.). The two former\r\nare chilly creatures and hardly stir from the Mediterranean; the third\r\ngoes pretty far north. The Half-spotted Scarab does not leave the\r\ncoast; he abounds on the sandy beaches of the Golfe Juan, Cette and\r\nPalavas. I have, in my time, admired his prowess at pill-rolling, of\r\nwhich he is as fervent a devotee as his colleague the Sacred Beetle.\r\nTo-day, though we are old friends, I cannot, to my great regret, give\r\nmy attention to him: we are too far away from each other. I recommend\r\nhim to any one wishing to add a chapter to Scarab biography: he also\r\nmust have—I feel nearly sure of it—peculiarities worth noting.\r\n\r\nAnd so, to complete this study, there remains in my immediate proximity\r\nonly the Broad-necked Scarab, the smallest of the three. He is very\r\nrare around Sérignan, though widely distributed in other parts of the\r\nVaucluse. This scarcity deprives me of opportunities for observing the\r\ninsect in the open fields; and my only resource is to bring up a few\r\nchance specimens in captivity.\r\n\r\nBehind the wire-gauze of his prison, the Broad-necked Scarab does not\r\ndisplay the Sacred Beetle’s athletic prowess nor his bold and hasty\r\ntemper. In his case we see no scuffles between robber and robbed, no\r\npills manufactured purely for art’s sake, rolled for a little while\r\nwith wild enthusiasm and then consigned to the rubbish-heap without\r\nbeing employed at all. The same blood does not flow in the veins of the\r\ntwo pill-rollers.\r\n\r\nOf a quieter disposition and less wasteful of his gleanings, the Beetle\r\nwith the broad corselet attacks discreetly the heap of manna provided\r\nby the Sheep; he picks from the best part some armfuls of material\r\nwhich he makes into a ball; he attends to his business without\r\ntroubling the others or being troubled by them. For the rest, his\r\nmethods are the same as those of the Sacred Beetle. The sphere, which\r\nis always an easier object to convey, is fashioned on the spot before\r\nbeing set in motion. With his wide fore-legs the Beetle pats and kneads\r\nand moulds it, making it smooth and level by adding an armful here and\r\nthere. The perfect roundness of the ball is achieved before it leaves\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nWhen the requisite size has been obtained, the pill-roller makes his\r\nway with his booty to the spot where the burrow is to be dug. The\r\njourney is effected exactly as it would be by the Sacred Beetle. Head\r\ndownwards, hind-legs lifted against the rolling mechanism, the insect\r\npushes backwards. So far there is nothing new, save for a certain\r\nslowness in the performance. But wait a little while: soon a striking\r\ndifference in habits will separate the two insects.\r\n\r\nAs each pill is carted away, I seize it, together with its owner, and\r\nplace both on the surface of a layer of fresh, close-packed sand in a\r\nflower-pot. A sheet of glass serves as a lid, keeps the sand nice and\r\ncool, prevents escape and admits the light. By interning each Beetle\r\nseparately, I am saved from the mistakes which might arise if I put\r\nthem in the common cage, where a number of my boarders are at work; and\r\nI shall not risk ascribing to several what may be the performance of\r\none alone. By this solitary confinement, each individual Beetle’s work\r\ncan be studied more easily.\r\n\r\nThe interned mother makes hardly any protest against her servitude.\r\nSoon she is digging the sand and disappears in it with her pill. Let us\r\ngive her time to establish her quarters and to get on with her domestic\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nThree or four weeks go by. The Beetle has not reappeared upon the\r\nsurface, a proof of her patient absorption in her maternal duties. At\r\nlast I remove the contents of the pot, very carefully, layer by layer,\r\nuntil I uncover a spacious burrow. The rubbish from this cavity was\r\nheaped up on the surface, forming a little mound. This is the secret\r\nchamber, the gynæceum in which the mother now and for a long time to\r\ncome keeps watch over her budding family.\r\n\r\nThe original pill has disappeared. In its stead are two little pears,\r\nelegantly shaped and wonderfully finished: two, not one, as I naturally\r\nexpected from the information already in my possession. They strike me\r\nas being even more delicately and gracefully rounded than the Sacred\r\nBeetle’s. Perhaps their tiny dimensions cause my preference: maxime\r\nmiranda in minimis. They measure 33 millimetres in length and 24\r\nmillimetres across their greatest width. [32] Let us drop figures and\r\nadmit that the dumpy modeller, with her slow and awkward ways, is the\r\nartistic rival or even the superior of her famous kinswoman. I expected\r\nto see some clumsy apprentice; I find a consummate artificer. We must\r\nnot judge people by appearances; it is a wise maxim, even when applied\r\nto insects.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the pot somewhat earlier, it will tell us how the pear is\r\nmade. I find sometimes a perfectly round ball and a pear without any\r\ntraces of the original pill; sometimes a ball only, with a nearly\r\nhemispherical remnant of the pill, a lump from which the materials\r\nsubjected to modelling have been detached in one piece. The method of\r\nwork can be deduced from these facts.\r\n\r\nThe pill which the Scarab fashions on the surface of the soil by taking\r\narmfuls from the heap encountered is but a temporary piece of work,\r\nwhich is given a round form with the sole object of facilitating its\r\ntransport. He gives his attention to it, no doubt, but is not unduly\r\nanxious about it; all that he wants is that the journey should be\r\neffected without any crumbling of his treasure or impediment in the\r\nrolling. The surface of the sphere, therefore, is not thoroughly\r\ntreated; it is not compressed into a rind or made scrupulously even.\r\n\r\nUnderground, when it is a question of getting the egg’s casket ready,\r\nthe casket that is to be both larder and cradle, it becomes another\r\nmatter. An incision is made all round the pill, dividing it into two\r\nalmost equal portions, and one half is subjected to manipulation, while\r\nthe other lies just against it, destined to receive the same treatment\r\nlater. The hemisphere worked upon is rounded into a ball, which will be\r\nthe belly of the prospective pear. This time, the modelling is\r\nperformed with the nicest care: the future of the larva, which also is\r\nexposed to the dangers of overdry bread, is at stake. The surface of\r\nthe ball is therefore patted at one spot after the other,\r\nconscientiously hardened by compression and levelled along a regular\r\ncurve. The spherule thus obtained possesses geometrical precision, or\r\nvery nearly so. Let us not forget that this difficult work is\r\naccomplished without rolling, as the clean condition of the surface\r\nshows.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the business may be guessed from the proceedings of the\r\nSacred Beetle. The sphere is hollowed into a crater and becomes a sort\r\nof bulging, shallow pot. The lips are drawn out into a pocket which\r\nreceives the egg. The pocket is closed, polished outside and joined\r\nneatly to the sphere. The pear is finished. The other half of the pill\r\nis now similarly treated.\r\n\r\nThe notable feature of this work is the elegant regularity of the forms\r\nobtained without any rolling. Chance enables me to add another and a\r\nmost striking proof to the many that I have given of this modelling\r\ndone on the spot. Once and once only I managed to get from the\r\nBroad-necked Scarab two pears closely soldered together by their\r\nbellies and lying in opposite directions. The first one constructed can\r\nteach us nothing new, but the second tells us this: when, for a reason\r\nthat is not apparent, for lack of room perhaps, the insect left this\r\nsecond pear touching the other and soldered it to its neighbour while\r\nworking at it, obviously, with this appendage, any rolling or any\r\nmoving became impracticable. Nevertheless, the pretty shape was secured\r\nto perfection.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of instinct, the distinguishing features which\r\nmake of the two pear-modellers two entirely different species are\r\nabsolutely clear from these details and much more conclusive than the\r\npeculiarities in the corselet and wing-case. The Sacred Beetle’s burrow\r\nnever contains more than one pear. The Broad-necked Scarab’s contains\r\ntwo. I even suspect that there are sometimes three, when the haul is a\r\nlarge one: we shall learn more on this subject from the Copres. The\r\nfirst, when she gets her pill underground, uses it just as she obtained\r\nit in the workyard and does not subdivide it at all. The second breaks\r\nup hers, though it is a little smaller, into two equal parts and\r\nfashions each half into a pear. The single ball gives place to two and\r\nsometimes even perhaps to three. If the two Dung-beetles have a common\r\norigin, I should like to know how this radical difference in their\r\ndomestic economy declared itself.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Gymnopleuri is the same as that of the Scarabs, on a\r\nmore modest scale. To pass it over in silence, for fear of too much\r\nsameness, would be to deprive ourselves of evidence calculated to\r\nconfirm certain theories whose truth is established by the recurrence\r\nof similar facts. Let us set it forth, in an abridged form.\r\n\r\nThe Gymnopleurus family owes its name to a lateral notch in the\r\nwing-cases, which leaves a part of the sides bare. It is represented in\r\nFrance by two species. One, with smooth wing-cases (G. pilularius,\r\nFab.), is fairly common everywhere; the other (G. flagellatus, Fab.),\r\nstippled on the top with little holes, as though the insect had been\r\npitted with small-pox, is rarer and prefers the south. Both species\r\nabound in the pebbly plains of my neighbourhood, where the Sheep pass\r\namid the lavender and thyme. Their shape is not unlike that of the\r\nSacred Beetle; but they are much smaller. For the rest, they have the\r\nsame habits, the same fields of operation, the same nesting-period: May\r\nand June, down to July.\r\n\r\nApplying themselves to similar labours, Gymnopleuri and Scarabs are\r\nbrought into each other’s society rather by the force of things than by\r\nthe love of company. I not infrequently see them settling next door to\r\neach other; I even oftener find them seated at the same heap. In bright\r\nsunshine the banqueters are sometimes very numerous. The Gymnopleuri\r\npredominate largely.\r\n\r\nOne would be inclined to think that these insects, endowed with powers\r\nof nimble and sustained flight, explore the country in swarms and that,\r\nwhen they find rich plunder, they all swoop down upon it at once.\r\nThough the sight of so large a crowd might seem to mean something of\r\nthe kind, I am very sceptical about these expeditions in large\r\nsquadrons. I am more ready to believe that the Gymnopleuri have come,\r\nfrom everywhere in the neighbourhood, one by one, guided by keenness of\r\nscent. What I see is a gathering of individuals who have hastened from\r\nevery point of the compass, and not the halt of a swarm engaged on a\r\ncommon search. No matter: the teeming colony is at times so numerous\r\nthat it would be possible to pick up the Gymnopleuri by handfuls.\r\n\r\nBut they hardly give one time. When the peril is realized, which soon\r\nhappens, most of them fly off with all speed; the others crouch low and\r\nhide themselves under the heap. In a moment the tumult of activity is\r\nsucceeded by absolute stillness. The Sacred Beetle is not subject to\r\nthese sudden attacks of panic, which empty the busiest yard in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye. When surprised at his task and examined at close\r\nquarters, however importunately, he impassively continues his work. He\r\nknows no fear. Here we see a thorough difference in temperament between\r\ninsects which are identical in structure and which follow the same\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThe difference is equally marked in another respect: the Sacred Beetle\r\nis a fervent pill-roller. When the ball is made, his supreme felicity,\r\nhis summa voluptas, is to cart it backwards for hours at a time, to\r\njuggle with it, so to speak, under a blazing sun. His epithet\r\npilularius notwithstanding, the Gymnopleurus does not show so much\r\nenthusiasm over a round pellet. Unless he means to feed upon it quietly\r\nin a burrow or to use it as a ration for his larva, he never kneads a\r\nball only to roll it about ecstatically and then abandon it when this\r\nviolent exercise has given him his fill of pleasure.\r\n\r\nBoth in his wild state and in captivity, the Gymnopleurus makes his\r\nmeal on the spot where he finds his food; it is hardly his habit to\r\nmake a round loaf in order to consume it afterwards in some underground\r\nretreat. The pill to which the insect owes its name is rolled, so far\r\nas I have seen, only in the interests of its family.\r\n\r\nThe mother takes from the heap the amount of material required for\r\nrearing a larva and kneads it into a ball at the spot where it is\r\ngathered. Then, going backwards, with her head down, like the Scarabs,\r\nshe rolls it and finally stores it in a burrow, in order to give it the\r\nnecessary treatment for the egg to thrive.\r\n\r\nOf course the rolling ball never contains the egg. The laying takes\r\nplace not on the public highway but in the privacy of the subsoil. A\r\nburrow is dug, two or three inches deep at most. It is spacious in\r\nproportion to its contents, proving that the Sacred Beetle’s\r\nstudio-work is repeated by the Gymnopleurus. I am speaking of that\r\nmodelling in which the artist must have full liberty of movement. When\r\nthe egg is laid, the cell remains empty; only the passage is filled up,\r\nas witness the little mound outside, the surplus of the unreplaced\r\nrefuse.\r\n\r\nA minute’s digging with my pocket-trowel and the humble cabin is laid\r\nbare. The mother is often present, occupied in some trifling household\r\nduties before quitting the cell for good. In the middle of the room\r\nlies her work, the cradle of the germ and the ration of the coming\r\nlarva. Its shape and size are those of a Sparrow’s egg; and I am here\r\nspeaking of both Gymnopleuri, whose habits and labours are so much\r\nalike that I need not distinguish between them. Unless we found the\r\nmother beside it, we should be unable to tell whether the ovoid which\r\nwe have dug up is the work of the smooth or of the pock-marked insect.\r\nAt most, a slight advantage in size might point to the former; and even\r\nso this characteristic is far from trustworthy.\r\n\r\nThe egg-shape, with its two unequal ends, one large and round, the\r\nother more pointed, shaped like an elliptical nipple, or even drawn out\r\ninto the neck of a pear, confirms the conclusions with which we are\r\nalready acquainted. An outline of this kind is not obtained by rolling,\r\nwhich is only reconcilable with a sphere. To get it, the mother must\r\nknead her lump of stuff. This may be already more or less round, as the\r\nresult of the work done in the yard whence it came and of the\r\nsubsequent carting, or it may still be shapeless, if the heap was near\r\nenough to allow of immediate storing. In short, once at home, she acts\r\nlike the Sacred Beetle, and does modelling-work.\r\n\r\nThe material lends itself well to this. Taken from the most plastic\r\nstuff supplied by the Sheep, it is shaped as easily as clay. In this\r\nway the graceful, firm, polished ovoid is obtained, a work of art like\r\nthe pear and as exquisite in its soft curve as a bird’s egg.\r\n\r\nWhere, inside it, is the insect’s germ? If we argued rightly when\r\ndiscussing the Sacred Beetle, if really the questions of ventilation\r\nand warmth demand that the egg be as near as possible to the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere, while remaining protected by a rampart, it is\r\nevident that the egg must be installed at the small end of the ovoid,\r\nbehind a thin defensive wall.\r\n\r\nAnd this in fact is where it lies, lodged in a tiny hatching-chamber\r\nand wrapped on every side in a blanket of air, which is easily renewed\r\nthrough a slender partition and a matted plug. This position did not\r\nsurprise me; from what the Sacred Beetle had already taught me I\r\nexpected it. The point of my knife, this time no novice, went straight\r\nto the ovoid’s pointed teat and scratched. The egg appeared,\r\nmagnificently confirming the argument which had at first been merely\r\nsuspected, then dimly seen and finally changed into certainty by the\r\nrecurrence of the fundamental facts under varying conditions.\r\n\r\nScarabs and Gymnopleuri are modellers who were not educated in the same\r\nschool; they differ in the outline of their masterpiece. With the same\r\nmaterials, the first manufacture pears, the second for the most part\r\novoids; and yet, despite this divergence, they both conform to the\r\nessential conditions demanded by the egg and by the grub. The grub\r\nwants provisions that are not liable to become prematurely dry. This\r\ncondition is fulfilled, so far as may be, by giving the mass a round\r\nshape, which evaporates less quickly because of its smaller surface.\r\nThe egg requires unrestricted air and the heat of the sun’s rays,\r\nconditions which are fulfilled in the one case by the pear with its\r\nneck and in the other by the ovoid with its pointed end.\r\n\r\nLaid in June, the egg of either species of Gymnopleuri hatches in less\r\nthan a week. The average is five or six days. Any one who has seen the\r\nlarva of the Sacred Beetle knows, so far as essentials go, the larva of\r\nthe two small pill-rollers. In each case it is a big-bellied grub,\r\ncurved into a hook and carrying a hump or knapsack which contains a\r\nportion of the mighty digestive apparatus. The body is cut off\r\nslantwise at the back and forms a stercoral trowel, denoting habits\r\nsimilar to those of the Sacred Beetle’s larva.\r\n\r\nWe see repeated, in fact, the peculiarities described in the story of\r\nthe big pill-roller. In the larval state, the Gymnopleuri also are\r\ngreat excreters, ever ready with mortar to make good the imperilled\r\ndwelling. They instantly repair the breaches which I make, either to\r\nobserve them in the privacy of their home or to provoke their\r\nplastering-industry. They fill up the chinks with putty, solder the\r\nparts that become disjointed, mend the broken cell. When the nymphosis\r\napproaches, the mortar that remains is expended in a layer of stucco,\r\nwhich reinforces and polishes the inner walls.\r\n\r\nThe same dangers give rise to the same defensive methods. Like the\r\nSacred Beetles’, the shell of the Gymnopleuri is liable to crack. The\r\nfree admission of air to the interior would have disastrous\r\nconsequences, by drying the food, which must keep soft until the grub\r\nhas attained its full growth. An intestine which is never empty and\r\nwhich displays unparalleled docility gets the threatened grub out of\r\nits trouble. There is no need to enlarge upon this point; the Sacred\r\nBeetle has told us all about it.\r\n\r\nThe insects reared in captivity tell me that, in the Gymnopleuri, the\r\nlarva lasts seventeen to twenty-five days and the nymph fifteen to\r\ntwenty. These figures are bound to vary, but within narrow limits. I\r\nshall therefore fix each period at approximately three weeks.\r\n\r\nNothing remarkable happens during the nymphal stage. The only thing to\r\nbe noted is the curious costume worn by the perfect insect on its first\r\nappearance. It is the costume which the Sacred Beetle showed us: head,\r\ncorselet, legs and chest a rusty red; wing-cases and abdomen white. We\r\nmay add that, being powerless to burst his shell, which has been turned\r\ninto a strong-box by the heat of August, the prisoner, in order to\r\nrelease himself, waits until the first September rains come to his help\r\nand soften the wall.\r\n\r\nInstinct, which under normal conditions amazes us with its unerring\r\nprescience, astonishes us no less with its dense ignorance when\r\nunaccustomed conditions supervene. Each insect has its trade, in which\r\nit excels, its series of actions logically arranged. Here it is really\r\na master. Its foresight, though unwitting, here surpasses our\r\ndeliberate science; its unconscious inspiration is here the superior of\r\nour conscious reason. But divert it from its natural course; and\r\nforthwith darkness succeeds the splendours of light. Nothing will\r\nrekindle the extinguished rays, not even the greatest stimulus that\r\nexists, the stimulus of maternity.\r\n\r\nI have given many instances of this strange antithesis, [33] which is\r\nthe death-blow to certain theories; I find another and an exceedingly\r\nstriking one in the Dung-beetles whose story I have now nearly finished\r\ntelling. We are surprised at this clear vision of the future possessed\r\nby our manufacturers of spheres, pears and ovoids; but we are no less\r\nsurprised by something totally different, namely, the mother’s profound\r\nindifference to the nursery which but now was the object of her\r\ntenderest cares.\r\n\r\nMy remarks apply equally to the Sacred Beetle and the two Gymnopleuri,\r\nall of whom display the same admirable zeal when the grub’s comfort has\r\nto be assured, and later, with no less unanimity, the same\r\nindifference. I surprise the mother in her burrow before she has laid\r\nher eggs, or, if the laying be over, before she has added those\r\nmeticulous after-touches dictated by her exaggerated conscientiousness.\r\nI install her in a pot packed full of earth, placing her on the surface\r\nof the artificial soil, together with her work, in its more or less\r\nadvanced state. In this place of banishment, provided that it be quiet,\r\nthere is not much hesitation. The mother, who until now has held her\r\nprecious materials tight-clutched, decides to dig a burrow. As the work\r\nof excavation progresses, she drags her pellet down with her, for it is\r\na sacred thing with which she must not part at any time, even amid the\r\ndifficulties of her digging. Soon the cell in which the pear or the\r\novoid is to be made is in existence at the bottom of the pot.\r\n\r\nI now intervene and turn the pot upside down. Everything is\r\ntopsy-turvy; the entrance-gallery and the terminal hall disappear. I\r\nextract the mother and the pellet from the ruins. Once more the pot is\r\nfilled with earth; and the same test begins all over again. A few hours\r\nare enough to restore the courage shaken by all this upheaval. For the\r\nsecond time, the mother buries herself with the heap of provisions\r\ndestined for the grub. For the second time also, when the establishment\r\nis finished, the overturning of the pot unsettles everything. The\r\nexperiment is renewed. Persisting in its maternal solicitude, if\r\nnecessary until its strength gives way, the insect again buries itself,\r\ntogether with its sphere.\r\n\r\nFour times over, in two days, I have thus seen the mother Beetle bear\r\nup under the devastation which I have wrought and start afresh, with\r\ntouching patience, on the ruined dwelling. I did not think fit to\r\npursue the test. You feel some scruples in submitting maternal\r\naffection to such tribulations as these. However, it seems probable\r\nthat, sooner or later, the exhausted and bewildered insect would have\r\nrefused to go on digging.\r\n\r\nMy experiments of this kind are numerous; and they all prove that, when\r\ntaken from her burrow with her work unfinished, the mother shows\r\nindefatigable perseverance in burying and depositing in a place of\r\nsafety the cradle which has begun to take shape though as yet\r\nuntenanted. For the sake of a pellet of stuff which the presence of the\r\negg has not yet turned into a sacred thing, she displays exaggerated\r\nprudence and caution, as well as amazing foresight. No tricks of the\r\nexperimenter, no all-upsetting accidents, nothing, unless her strength\r\nbe worn out, can divert her from her object. She is filled with a sort\r\nof indomitable obsession. The future of her race requires that the lump\r\nof stuff should descend into the earth; and descend it will, whatever\r\nhappens.\r\n\r\nNow for the other side of the medal. The egg is laid; everything is in\r\norder underground. The mother comes out. I take hold of her as she does\r\nso; I dig up the pear or ovoid; I place the work and the worker side by\r\nside on the surface of the soil, in the conditions that prevailed just\r\nnow. This assuredly is the right moment for burying the pill. It\r\ncontains the egg, a delicate thing which a touch of the sun will wither\r\nin its thin wrapper. Expose it for fifteen minutes to the heat of the\r\nsun’s rays; and all will be lost. What will the mother do in this grave\r\nemergency?\r\n\r\nShe does nothing at all. She does not even seem to perceive the\r\npresence of the object which was so precious to her yesterday, when the\r\negg was not yet laid. Zealous to excess before the laying is over, she\r\nis indifferent afterwards. The finished work no longer concerns her.\r\nImagine a pebble in the place of the ovoid or pear: the mother would\r\ntreat it no better and no worse. One sole preoccupation urges her: to\r\nget away. I can see that by the manner in which she paces the enclosure\r\nthat keeps her prisoner.\r\n\r\nThat is instinct’s way: it buries perseveringly the lifeless lump and\r\nleaves the quickened lump to perish on the surface. The work to be done\r\nis everything; the work done no longer counts. Instinct sees the future\r\nand knows nothing of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH COPRIS: THE LAYING OF THE EGGS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we show instinct doing for the egg what would be done on the advice\r\nof reason matured by study and experience, we achieve a result of no\r\nsmall philosophic importance; and an austere scientific conscience\r\nbegins to trouble me with scruples. Not that I wish to give science a\r\nforbidding aspect: I am convinced that one can say the wisest things\r\nwithout employing a barbarous vocabulary. Clearness is the supreme\r\ncourtesy of the wielder of the pen. I do my best to observe it. No, the\r\nscruple that stops me is of another kind.\r\n\r\nI begin to wonder if I am not in this case the victim of an illusion. I\r\nsay to myself:\r\n\r\n‘Gymnopleuri and Sacred Beetles, when in the open air, are\r\nmanufacturers of balls or pills. That is their trade, learnt we know\r\nnot how, prescribed perhaps by their structure, in particular by their\r\nlong legs, some of which are slightly curved. When they are making\r\npreparations for the egg, is it so wonderful that they continue\r\nunderground their own ball-making speciality?’\r\n\r\nIf we leave out of the question the neck of the pear and the projecting\r\ntip of the ovoid, details much more difficult to explain, there remains\r\nthe most important part so far as bulk is concerned, the globular part,\r\na repetition of the thing which the insect makes outside the burrow;\r\nthere remains the pellet with which the Sacred Beetle plays in the\r\nsunshine, sometimes without making any other use of it, the ball which\r\nthe Gymnopleurus rolls peacefully over the turf.\r\n\r\nThen what is the object here of the globular form, the best\r\npreventative of desiccation during the heat of summer? This property of\r\nthe sphere and of its near neighbour, the ovoid, is an accepted\r\nphysical fact; but it is only by accident that these shapes are the\r\nright ones to overcome that difficulty. A creature built for rolling\r\nballs across the fields goes on making balls underground. If the grub\r\nfare all the better for finding tender foodstuffs under its mandibles\r\nto the very end, that is a capital thing for the grub, but it is no\r\nreason why we should extol the instinct of the mother.\r\n\r\nSo I argued, saying to myself that, before I was convinced, I should\r\nneed to be shown a Dung-beetle who was utterly unfamiliar with the\r\npill-making business in everyday life and who yet, when laying-time was\r\nat hand, made an abrupt change in her habits and shaped her provisions\r\ninto a ball. My Dung-beetle would have to be a good fat one too. Is\r\nthere any such in my neighbourhood? Yes, there is; and she is one of\r\nthe handsomest and largest, next to the Sacred Beetle. I speak of the\r\nSpanish Copris (C. hispanus, Lin.), who is so remarkable on account of\r\nthe sharp slope of her corselet and the disproportionate size of the\r\nhorn surmounting her head.\r\n\r\nRound and squat, the Spanish Copris with her ponderous gait is\r\ncertainly a stranger to gymnastics such as are performed by the Sacred\r\nBeetle or the Gymnopleurus. Her legs, which are of insignificant length\r\nand folded under her belly at the slightest alarm, bear no comparison\r\nwith the stilts of the pill-rollers. Their stunted form and lack of\r\nflexibility are enough in themselves to tell us that their owner would\r\nnot care to roam about hampered by a rolling ball.\r\n\r\nThe Copris is indeed of a sedentary habit. Once he has found his\r\nprovisions, at night or in the evening twilight, he digs a burrow under\r\nthe heap. It is a rough cavern, large enough to hold an apple. Here is\r\nintroduced, bit by bit, the stuff that is just over his head or at any\r\nrate lying on the threshold of the cavern; here is engulfed, in no\r\ndefinite shape, an enormous supply of victuals, bearing eloquent\r\nwitness to the insect’s gluttony. As long as the hoard lasts, the\r\nCopris, engrossed in the pleasures of the table, does not return to the\r\nsurface. The home is not abandoned until the larder is emptied, when\r\nthe insect recommences its nocturnal quest, finds a new treasure and\r\nscoops out another temporary dwelling.\r\n\r\nAs his trade is merely that of a gatherer of manure, shovelling in the\r\nstuff without any preliminary manipulation, the Copris is evidently\r\nquite ignorant, for the time being, of the art of kneading and\r\nmodelling a globular loaf. Besides, his short, clumsy legs seem utterly\r\nirreconcilable with any such art.\r\n\r\nIn May, or June at latest, comes laying-time. The insect, so ready to\r\nfill its own belly with the most sordid materials, becomes particular\r\nwhere the portion of its family is concerned. Like the Sacred Beetle,\r\nlike the Gymnopleurus, it now wants the soft produce of the Sheep,\r\ndeposited in a single slab. Even when abundant, the cake is buried on\r\nthe spot in its entirety. Not a trace of it remains outside. Economy\r\ndemands that it be collected to the very last crumb.\r\n\r\nYou see: no travelling, no carting, no preparations. The cake is\r\ncarried down to the cellar by armfuls, at the very spot where it lies.\r\nThe insect repeats, with an eye to its grubs, what it did when working\r\nfor itself. As for the burrow, whose presence is indicated by a\r\ngood-sized mound, it is a roomy cavern excavated to a depth of some\r\neight inches. I observe that it is more spacious and better built than\r\nthe temporary abodes occupied by the Copris at times of revelry.\r\n\r\nBut let us turn from the insect in its wild state to the insect in\r\ncaptivity. In the former case the evidence furnished by chance\r\nencounters would be incomplete, fragmentary and of dubious relevancy;\r\nand we shall do better to watch the Copris in my insect-house,\r\nespecially as she lends herself admirably to this sort of observation.\r\nLet us observe the storing first.\r\n\r\nIn the soft evening light I see her appear on the threshold of her\r\nburrow. She has come up from the depths, she is going to gather in her\r\nharvest. She has not far to go: the provisions are there, outside the\r\ndoor, a generous supply which I am careful to replenish. Cautiously,\r\nready to retreat at the least alarm, she makes her way to them with a\r\nslow and measured step. Her shield does the rummaging and dissecting,\r\nher fore-legs are busy extracting. An armful, quite a modest one, is\r\npulled away, crumbling to pieces. The Copris drags it backwards and\r\ndisappears underground. In less than two minutes, she is back again.\r\nWith feathery antennæ outspread, she warily scans the neighbourhood\r\nbefore crossing the threshold of her dwelling.\r\n\r\nA distance of two or three inches separates her from the heap of\r\nprovisions. It is a serious matter for her to venture so far. She would\r\nhave liked the victuals to be exactly overhead, forming a roof to her\r\nhouse. That would have saved her from having to make these expeditions,\r\nwhich are a source of anxiety. I have decided otherwise. To facilitate\r\nobservation, I have placed the supplies just on one side. By degrees\r\nthe nervous creature is reassured; it becomes accustomed to the open\r\nair and to my presence, which, of course, I make as unobtrusive as\r\npossible. Armful after armful goes down into the cellar. They are\r\nalways shapeless bits, shreds such as one might pick off with a small\r\npair of pincers.\r\n\r\nHaving learnt what I want to know about the insect’s method of\r\nwarehousing its provisions, I leave it to its work, which continues for\r\nthe best part of the night. On the following days, nothing happens; the\r\nCopris goes out no more. Enough treasure has been laid up in a single\r\nnight. Let us wait a while and leave her time to stow away her stuff as\r\nshe pleases.\r\n\r\nBefore the week is out, I dig up the soil in my insect-house and bring\r\nto light the burrow whose victualling I have been watching. As in the\r\nfields, it is a spacious hall with an irregular, elliptic roof and an\r\nalmost level floor. In a corner is a round hole, similar to the orifice\r\nin the neck of a bottle. This is the goods-entrance, opening on a\r\nslanting gallery that runs up to the surface of the soil. The walls of\r\nthis house, which was hollowed out of fresh earth, have been carefully\r\ncompressed and are strong enough to resist any seismic disturbances\r\ncaused by my excavations. It is easy to see that the insect, toiling\r\nfor the future, has put forth all its skill, all its digging-powers, in\r\norder to produce lasting work. The banqueting-tent may be a hole\r\nhurriedly scooped out, with irregular and none too stable walls, but\r\nthe permanent dwelling is of larger dimensions and much more carefully\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nI suspect that both sexes have a share in this architectural\r\nmasterpiece; at least, I often come upon the pair in the burrows\r\ndestined for the laying of the eggs. The roomy and luxurious apartment\r\nwas no doubt once the wedding-hall; the marriage was consummated under\r\nthe mighty dome in the building of which the lover had cooperated: a\r\ngallant way of declaring his passion. I also suspect him of lending his\r\npartner a hand with the collecting and storing of the provisions. From\r\nwhat I have gathered, he too, strong as he is, shares in this finicking\r\nwork, collects his armfuls and descends into the crypt. It is a quicker\r\njob when there are two to help. But, once the home is well stocked, he\r\nretires discreetly, makes his way back to the surface and goes and\r\nsettles down elsewhere, leaving the mother to her delicate task. His\r\npart in the family-mansion is ended.\r\n\r\nNow what do we find in this mansion, to which we have seen so many tiny\r\nloads of provisions lowered? A mass of small pieces, heaped together\r\nanyhow? Not a bit of it. I always find a simple lump, a huge loaf which\r\nfills the dwelling except for a narrow passage all round, just wide\r\nenough to give the mother room to move.\r\n\r\nThis sumptuous portion, a regular Twelfth-Night cake, has no fixed\r\nshape. I come across some that are ovoid, suggesting a Turkey’s egg in\r\nform and size; I find some that are a flattened ellipsoid, similar to\r\nthe common onion; I discover some that are almost round, reminding me\r\nof a Dutch cheese; I see some that are circular with a slight swelling\r\non the upper surface, like the loaves of the Provençal peasant or,\r\nbetter still, the egg-cake, the fougasso à l’iôu with which he\r\ncelebrates Easter. In every case the surface is smooth and nicely\r\ncurved.\r\n\r\nThere is no mistaking what has happened: the mother has collected and\r\nkneaded into one lump the numerous fragments brought down one after the\r\nother; out of all those particles she has made a homogeneous thing, by\r\nmashing them, working them together and treading on them. Time after\r\ntime I come across the baker on top of the colossal loaf which makes\r\nthe Sacred Beetle’s pill look so insignificant; she strolls about on\r\nthe convex surface, which sometimes measures as much as four inches\r\nacross; she pats the mass, makes it firm and level. I just catch sight\r\nof the curious scene, for, the moment she is perceived, the pastry-cook\r\nslips down the curved slope and hides away under her cake.\r\n\r\nFor a further knowledge of the work, for a study of its innermost\r\ndetail, we shall have to resort to artifice. There is scarcely any\r\ndifficulty about it. Either my long practice with the Sacred Beetle has\r\nmade me more skilful in my methods of research, or else the Copris is\r\nless reserved and bears the rigours of captivity more philosophically:\r\nat any rate, I succeed, without the slightest trouble, in following all\r\nthe phases of the nest-making to my heart’s content.\r\n\r\nI employ two methods, each of them adapted for enlightening me on some\r\nspecial points. Whenever the vivarium supplies me with a few large\r\ncakes, I take these out of the burrows, together with the mother\r\nCopris, and place them in my study. The receptacles are of two sorts,\r\naccording to whether I want light or darkness. In the former case, I\r\nuse glass jars with a diameter more or less the same as that of the\r\nburrows, say four to five inches. At the bottom of each is a thin layer\r\nof fresh sand, quite insufficient to allow the Copris to bury herself\r\nin it, but still serving the purpose of sparing the insect the slippery\r\nfoothold of the actual glass and giving it the illusion of a soil\r\nsimilar to that of which I have just deprived it. With this layer the\r\njar becomes a suitable cage for the mother and her loaf.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that the startled insect would not undertake anything\r\nwhile light prevailed, no matter how dim and tempered. It must have\r\ncomplete darkness, which I produce by means of a cardboard sheath\r\nenclosing the jar. By carefully raising this sheath a little, I can\r\nsurprise the captive at her work whenever I feel inclined, the light in\r\nmy study being a shaded one, and even watch operations for a time. The\r\nreader will notice that this arrangement is much less complex than that\r\nwhich I used when I wished to see the Sacred Beetle engaged in\r\nmodelling her pear, the simpler method being made possible by the\r\ndifferent temperament of the Copris, who is more easy-going than her\r\nkinswoman. A dozen of these eclipsed appliances are thus arranged on my\r\nlarge laboratory-table. Any one seeing them standing in a row would\r\ntake them for a collection of groceries in whity-brown paper bags.\r\n\r\nFor my dark apparatus I use flower-pots filled with fresh, well-packed\r\nsand. The mother and her cake occupy the lower part, which is adapted\r\nas a niche by means of a cardboard screen forming a ceiling and\r\nsupporting the sand above. Or else I simply put the mother on the\r\nsurface of the sand with a supply of provisions. She digs herself a\r\nburrow, does her warehousing, makes herself a home; and things follow\r\nthe usual course. In all cases I rely upon a sheet of glass, which does\r\nduty as a lid, to keep my prisoners safe. These different devices will,\r\nI trust, give me information on a delicate point of which I will say\r\nmore later.\r\n\r\nWhat do the glass jars covered with an opaque sheath teach us? A good\r\nmany things, all of them interesting, and this to begin with: the big\r\nloaf does not owe its curve—which is always regular, no matter how much\r\nthe actual shape may vary—to any rolling process. Our inspection of the\r\nnatural burrow has already told us that so large a mass could not have\r\nbeen rolled into a cavity of which it fills almost the whole space.\r\nBesides, the strength of the insect would be unequal to moving so great\r\na load.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I go to the jar for information and on every occasion\r\nthe same evidence is forthcoming. I see the mother, hoisted on top of\r\nthe lump, feeling here, feeling there, bestowing little taps, smoothing\r\naway the projecting points, perfecting the thing; never do I catch her\r\nlooking as though she wanted to turn the block. It is clear as\r\ndaylight: rolling has nothing whatever to do with the matter.\r\n\r\nThe dough-maker’s assiduity, her patient care make me suspect an\r\nindustrial detail whereof I was far from dreaming. Why so many\r\nafter-touches to the mass, why so long a wait before making use of it?\r\nIt is, in fact, a week or more before the insect, still busy with its\r\npressing and polishing, makes up its mind to do something with its\r\nhoard.\r\n\r\nWhen the baker has kneaded his dough to the requisite extent, he\r\ncollects it into a single lump in a corner of the kneading-trough. The\r\nleaven will work better in the depths of the voluminous mass. The\r\nCopris knows this bakehouse secret. She heaps together all that she has\r\ncollected in her foraging; she carefully kneads the whole into a\r\nprovisional loaf and allows it time to improve by virtue of an internal\r\nprocess that gives flavour to the paste and makes it of the right\r\nconsistency for subsequent manipulations. As long as this chemical\r\nprocess remains unfinished, both the baker and the Copris wait. In the\r\ncase of the insect, it goes on for some time, a week at least.\r\n\r\nAt last it is ready. The baker’s man divides his lump into smaller\r\nlumps, each of which will become a loaf. The Copris does the same\r\nthing. By means of a circular cut made with the sharp edge of her\r\nforehead and the saw of her fore-legs, she detaches from the mass a\r\npiece of the prescribed size. With this stroke there is no hesitation,\r\nno after-touches adding a bit here and taking off a bit there. Straight\r\naway and with one sharp, decisive cut, she obtains the proper-sized\r\nlump.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes a question of shaping it. Clasping it as best she can in\r\nher short arms, so little adapted, one would think, to work of this\r\nkind, the Copris rounds her lump of dough by means of pressure and of\r\npressure only. Gravely she moves about on the still shapeless pill,\r\nclimbs up, climbs down, turns to right and left, above and below; here\r\nshe methodically applies a little more pressure, there a little less,\r\ntouching and retouching with unvarying patience, and finally, after\r\ntwenty-four hours of it, the piece that was all corners has become a\r\nperfect sphere, the size of a plum. There, in her crowded studio, with\r\nscarcely room to move, the podgy artist has completed her work without\r\nonce shaking it on its base; by dint of time and patience she has\r\nobtained the geometrical sphere which her clumsy tools and her confined\r\nspace seemed bound to deny her.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the insect continues to touch up its globe, polishing\r\nit affectionately, passing its foot gently to and fro until the least\r\nprotuberance has disappeared. These meticulous finishing touches seem\r\nendless. Towards the end of the second day, however, the sphere is\r\npronounced satisfactory. The mother climbs to the dome of her edifice\r\nand there, still by simple pressure, hollows out a shallow crater. In\r\nthis basin the egg is laid.\r\n\r\nThen, with extreme caution, with a delicacy that is most surprising\r\nwith such rough tools, the lips of the crater are brought together so\r\nas to form a vaulted roof over the egg. The mother turns slowly, does a\r\nlittle raking, draws the stuff upwards and finishes the\r\nclosing-process. This is the most ticklish work of all. A little too\r\nmuch pressure, a miscalculated thrust might easily jeopardize the life\r\nof the germ under its thin ceiling.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then the mother suspends operations. Motionless, with\r\nlowered forehead, she seems to be sounding the cavity beneath, to be\r\nlistening to what is happening inside. All’s well, it seems; and once\r\nagain she resumes her patient toil: the careful, delicate scraping of\r\nthe sides towards the summit, which begins to taper a little and\r\nlengthen out. In this way an ovoid with the small end uppermost takes\r\nthe place of the original sphere. Under the more or less projecting\r\nnipple is the hatching-chamber with the egg. Twenty-four hours more are\r\nspent in this minute work. Total: four times round the clock and\r\nsometimes longer to construct the sphere, scoop out a basin, lay the\r\negg and shut it in by transforming the sphere into an ovoid.\r\n\r\nThe insect goes back to the cut loaf and helps itself to a second\r\nslice, which, by the same manipulations as before, becomes an ovoid\r\ntenanted by an egg. The surplus suffices for a third ovoid, sometimes\r\neven for a fourth. I have never seen this number exceeded when the\r\nmother had at her disposal only the materials which she had accumulated\r\nin the burrow.\r\n\r\nThe laying is over. Here is the mother in her retreat, which is almost\r\nfilled by the three or four cradles standing one against the other,\r\npointed end upwards. What will she do now? Go away, no doubt, to\r\nrecruit her strength a little in the open air after her prolonged fast.\r\nHe who thinks so is mistaken. She stays. And yet she has eaten nothing\r\nsince she came underground, taking good care not to touch the loaf,\r\nwhich, divided into equal portions, will provide the sustenance of the\r\nfamily. The Copris is touchingly scrupulous where the children’s\r\ninheritance is concerned: she is a devoted mother, who braves hunger\r\nrather than let her offspring suffer privation.\r\n\r\nShe braves it for a second reason: to mount guard around the cradles.\r\nFrom the end of June onwards the burrows are difficult to find, because\r\nthe mounds disappear through the action of storm or wind or the feet of\r\nthe passers-by. The few which I succeed in discovering always contain\r\nthe mother dozing beside a group of pills, in each of which a grub, now\r\nnearing its complete development, feasts on the fat of the land.\r\n\r\nMy dark appliances, flower-pots filled with fresh sand, confirm what\r\nthe fields have taught me. Buried with provisions in the first\r\nfortnight in May, the mothers do not reappear on the surface, under the\r\nglass lid. They keep hidden in the burrow after laying their eggs; they\r\nspend the sultry dog-days with their ovoids, watching them, no doubt,\r\nas the glass-jars, with their freedom from subterranean obscurity, tell\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThey come up again at the time of the first autumnal rains in\r\nSeptember. But by then the new generation has attained its perfect\r\nform. The mother, therefore, enjoys in her underground home that rare\r\nprivilege for an insect, the joy of knowing her family; she hears her\r\nchildren scratching at the shell to obtain their liberty; she is\r\npresent at the bursting of the casket which she has fashioned so\r\nconscientiously; maybe she helps the exhausted weaklings when the\r\nground has not been cool enough to soften the walls. Mother and progeny\r\nleave the underworld together; and together they arrive at the autumn\r\nbanquets, when the sun is mild and the ovine manna abounds along the\r\npaths.\r\n\r\nThe flower-pots teach us something else. I place on the surface a few\r\nseparate couples taken from their burrows at the outset of the\r\nbuilding-operations. They are given a generous supply of provisions.\r\nEach couple buries itself, settles down and starts hoarding; then,\r\nafter ten days or so, the male reappears on the surface, under the\r\nsheet of glass. The other does not stir an inch. The eggs are laid, the\r\nfood-balls are shaped, patiently rounded and grouped at the bottom of\r\nthe pot. And all the time, so that he may not disturb the mother in her\r\nwork, the father remains exiled from the gynæceum. He has climbed to\r\nthe surface with the intention of going and digging himself a shelter\r\nelsewhere. Being unable to do so within the narrow confines of the pot,\r\nhe stays at the top, barely concealed from view by a modicum of sand or\r\na few scraps of food. A lover of darkness and of the cool underground\r\ndepths, he remains obstinately for three months exposed to the air and\r\ndrought and light; he refuses to go to earth, lest he should interfere\r\nwith the sacred things that are taking place below. The Copris shall\r\nhave a good mark for thus respecting the maternal apartments.\r\n\r\nLet us come back to the jars, where the events hidden from us by the\r\nsoil are to be enacted before our eyes. The three or four pills, each\r\nwith its egg, stand one against another and occupy almost the whole\r\nenclosure, leaving only narrow passages. Of the original lump very\r\nlittle remains, at the most a few crumbs, which come in handy when\r\nappetite returns. But that does not worry the mother much. She is far\r\nmore concerned about her ovoids.\r\n\r\nAssiduously she goes from one to another, feels them, listens to them,\r\ntouches them up at points where my eye can perceive no flaw. Her\r\nclumsy, horn-shod foot, more sensitive in darkness than my retina in\r\nbroad daylight, is perhaps discovering incipient cracks or defective\r\nworkmanship in the matter of consistency which must be attended to, in\r\norder to prevent the air from entering and drying up the eggs. The\r\nprudent mother therefore slips in and out of the narrow spaces between\r\nthe cradles, inspecting them carefully and remedying any accident, no\r\nmatter how trifling. If I disturb her, she sometimes rubs the tip of\r\nher abdomen against the edge of her wing-cases, producing a soft\r\nrustling noise, which is almost a murmur of complaint. Thus, between\r\nscrupulous care and brief slumbers beside her group of cradles, the\r\nmother passes the three months essential to the evolution of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nI seem to catch a glimpse of the reason for this long watch. The\r\npill-rollers, whether Scarabs or Gymnopleuri, never have more than a\r\nsingle pear, a single ovoid in their burrows. The mass of foodstuff,\r\nwhich at times is rolled from a great distance, is necessarily limited\r\nby the insect’s own limitations of strength. It is enough for one\r\nlarva, but not enough for two. An exception must be made with respect\r\nto the Broad-necked Scarab, who brings up her family very frugally and\r\ndivides her rolling booty into two modest portions.\r\n\r\nThe others are obliged to dig a special burrow for each egg. When\r\neverything is in order in the new establishment—and this does not take\r\nlong—they leave the underground vault and go off somewhere else,\r\nwherever chance may lead them, to begin their pill-rolling, excavating\r\nand egg-laying once more. With these nomadic habits, any prolonged\r\nsupervision on the mother’s part becomes impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Scarab suffers by it. Her pear, which is magnificently regular at\r\nthe outset, soon shows cracks and becomes scaly and swollen. Various\r\ncryptogams invade it and undermine it; the material expands and the\r\nresultant splitting causes the pear to lose its shape. We have seen how\r\nthe grub combats these troubles.\r\n\r\nThe Copris has other ways. She does not roll her stores from a\r\ndistance; she warehouses them on the spot, bit by bit, which enables\r\nher to accumulate in a single burrow enough to satisfy all her brood.\r\nAs there is no need for further expeditions, the mother stays and keeps\r\nwatch. Under her never-failing vigilance, the pill does not crack, for\r\nany crevice is stopped up as soon as it appears; nor does it become\r\ncovered with parasitic vegetation, for nothing can grow on a soil that\r\nis constantly being raked. The two or three dozen ovoids which I have\r\nbefore my eyes all bear witness to the mother’s watchfulness: not one\r\nof them is split or cracked or infested with tiny fungi. In all of them\r\nthe surface is irreproachable. But, if I take them away from the mother\r\nto put them into a bottle or tin, they suffer the same fate as the\r\nSacred Beetle’s pears: in the absence of supervision, destruction more\r\nor less complete overtakes them.\r\n\r\nTwo examples will be instructive to us here. I take from a mother two\r\nor three pills and place them in a tin, which prevents them from\r\ngetting dry. Before a week has passed, they are covered with a fungous\r\nvegetation. More or less everything grows in this fertile soil; the\r\nlesser fungi delight in it. To-day it is an infinitesimal crystalline\r\nplant swollen into a bobbin-shape, bristling with short, dew-beaded\r\nhairs and ending in a little round head as black as jet. I have not the\r\nleisure to consult books and microscope and give a name to the tiny\r\napparition which attracts my attention for the first time. This\r\nbotanical detail is of little importance: all that we need know is that\r\nthe dark green of the pills has disappeared under the thick white\r\ncrystalline growth stippled with black specks.\r\n\r\nI restore the two pills to the Copris keeping watch over her third. I\r\nreplace the opaque sheath and leave the insect undisturbed in the dark.\r\nIn an hour’s time or less, I look to see how things are getting on. The\r\nparasitic vegetation has entirely disappeared, cut down, extirpated to\r\nthe last stalk. The magnifying-glass fails to reveal a trace of what, a\r\nlittle while before, was a dense thicket. The insect has used its rake,\r\nthose notched legs, to some purpose; and the surface of the pill is\r\nonce more in the unblemished condition necessary for health.\r\n\r\nThe other experiment is a more serious one. With the point of my\r\npenknife I make a gash in a pill at the upper end and lay bare the egg.\r\nHere we have an artificial breach not unlike those which might be\r\ncaused naturally, but of much greater size. I give back to the mother\r\nthe violated cradle, threatened with disaster unless she intervenes.\r\nBut she does intervene and that quickly, once darkness comes. The\r\nragged edges slit by the penknife are brought together and soldered.\r\nThe small amount of stuff lost is replaced by scrapings taken from the\r\nsides. In a very short time the breach is so neatly repaired that not a\r\ntrace remains of my onslaught.\r\n\r\nI repeat it, making the danger graver and attacking all four pills with\r\nmy desecrating penknife, which cuts right through the hatching-chamber\r\nand leaves the egg only an incomplete shelter under the gaping roof.\r\nThe mother’s counter-move is swift and effective. In one brief spell of\r\nwork everything is put right again. Yes, I can quite believe that with\r\nthis vigilant supervisor, who never sleeps except with one eye open,\r\nthere is no possibility of the cracks and the puffiness which so often\r\ndisfigure the Sacred Beetle’s pear.\r\n\r\nFour pills containing eggs are all that I have been able to obtain from\r\nthe big loaf which I took from the burrow at the time of the nuptials.\r\nDoes this mean that the Copris can lay only that number? I think so. I\r\neven believe that usually there are less, three, two, or possibly only\r\none. My boarders, installed in separate potfuls of sand at\r\nnesting-time, did not reappear on the surface once they had stored away\r\nthe necessary provisions; they never came out to dip into the\r\nreplenished stock and enable themselves to increase the always\r\nrestricted number of ovoids lying at the bottom of the pot under the\r\nmother’s watchful care.\r\n\r\nThis limitation of the family might very well be due partly to lack of\r\nspace. Three or four pills completely fill the burrow; there is no room\r\nfor more; and the mother, a stay-at-home alike from duty and\r\ninclination, does not dream of digging another dwelling. It is true\r\nthat greater breadth in the one which she has would solve the problem\r\nof room; but then a ceiling of excessive length would be liable to\r\ncollapse. Suppose I were myself to intervene, suppose I provided space\r\nwithout the risk of the roof falling in, could there be an increase in\r\nthe number of eggs?\r\n\r\nYes, the number is almost doubled. My trick is quite simple. In one of\r\nthe glass jars, I take away her three or four pills from a mother who\r\nhas just finished the last. None of the loaf remains. I substitute for\r\nit one of my own making, kneaded with the tip of a paper-knife. A new\r\ntype of baker, I do over again very nearly what the insect did at the\r\nbeginning. Reader, do not smile at my baking: science shall give it the\r\nodour of sanctity.\r\n\r\nMy cake is favourably received by the Copris, who sets to work again,\r\nstarts laying anew and presents me with three of her perfect ovoids,\r\nmaking seven in all, the greatest number that I obtained in my various\r\nattempts of this kind. A large piece of the bun remains available. The\r\nCopris does not utilize it, at least not for nest-building; she eats\r\nit. The ovaries appear to be exhausted. This much is proved: the\r\npillaging of the burrow provides space; and the mother, taking\r\nadvantage of it, nearly doubles the number of her eggs with the aid of\r\nthe cake which I make for her.\r\n\r\nUnder natural conditions nothing of a similar kind can happen. There is\r\nno obliging baker at hand, to shape and pat a new cake and slip it into\r\nthe oven that is the Copris’ cellar. Everything therefore tells us that\r\nthe stay-at-home Beetle, who makes up her mind not to reappear until\r\nthe cool autumn days, is of very limited bearing-capacity. Her family\r\nconsists of three or four at most. Occasionally, in the dog-days, long\r\nafter laying-time is past, I have even dug up a mother watching over a\r\nsolitary pill. This one, perhaps for lack of provisions, had reduced\r\nher maternal joys to the narrowest limits.\r\n\r\nThe loaves kneaded with my paper-knife are readily accepted. We will\r\ntake advantage of this fact to make a few experiments. Instead of the\r\nbig, substantial cake, I fashion a pill which is a replica in shape and\r\nsize of the three or four which the mother is guarding after confiding\r\nthe egg to them. My imitation is a fairly good one. If I were to mix up\r\nthe two products, the natural and the artificial, I might easily fail\r\nto distinguish between them afterwards. The counterfeit pill is placed\r\nin the jar, beside the other. The disturbed insect at once hides in a\r\ncorner, under a little sand. I leave it in peace for a couple of days.\r\nThen how great is my surprise to find the mother on the top of my pill,\r\ndigging a cup into it! In the afternoon the egg is laid and the cup\r\nclosed. I can only tell my pill from those of the Copris by the place\r\nwhich it occupies. I had put it at the extreme right of the group, and\r\nat the extreme right I find it, duly operated on by the insect. How\r\ncould the Beetle know that this ovoid, so like the others in every\r\nrespect, was untenanted? How did she allow herself unhesitatingly to\r\nscoop the top into a crater when, judging by appearances, there might\r\nbe an egg just underneath? She takes good care not to do any fresh\r\nexcavating on the finished pills. What guide leads her to the\r\nartificial one, which is extremely deceptive in appearance, and bids\r\nher dig into that?\r\n\r\nI do it again and yet again. The result is the same: the mother does\r\nnot confuse her work with mine and takes advantage of the presence of\r\nmy pill to install an egg in it. On only one occasion, when her\r\nappetite seems suddenly to have come back, did I see her feeding on my\r\nloaf. But her discrimination between the tenanted and the untenanted\r\nwas just as clearly marked here as in the previous instance. Instead of\r\nattacking, in her hunger, the pills with eggs, by what miracle of\r\ndivination does she turn, in spite of their exact outward similarity,\r\nto the pill which contains nothing?\r\n\r\nCan my handiwork be defective? Did the wooden blade not press hard\r\nenough to impart the proper consistency? Is there something wrong with\r\nthe dough as the result of insufficient kneading? These are delicate\r\nquestions, of which I, who am no expert in this kind of confectionery,\r\nam not competent to judge. Let us have recourse to a master of the\r\npastry-cook’s art. I borrow from the Sacred Beetle the pill which he is\r\nbeginning to roll in the vivarium. I choose a small one, of the size\r\naffected by the Copris. True, it is round; but the Copris’ pills also\r\nare pretty often round, even after receiving the egg.\r\n\r\nWell, the Sacred Beetle’s loaf, that loaf of irreproachable quality,\r\nkneaded by the king of bread-makers, meets with the same fate as mine.\r\nAt one time it is provided with an egg, at another it is eaten, while\r\nno accident ever happens by inadvertence to the exactly similar pills\r\nkneaded by the Copris.\r\n\r\nThat the insect, finding itself in this mixed assembly, should rip open\r\nwhat is still inanimate matter and respect what is already a cradle,\r\nthat it should discriminate between the lawful and the unlawful, in\r\ncircumstances such as these, seems to me incapable of explanation, if\r\nthere be no guide but senses resembling our own. It is useless to say\r\nthat it is a case of sight: the Beetle works in absolute darkness. Even\r\nif she worked in the light, that would not lessen the difficulty. The\r\nshape and appearance of the pill are alike in both instances; the\r\nclearest sight would be at fault once the pills were mixed up.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to suggest that smell has anything to do with it: the\r\nsubstance of the pill does not vary; it is always the produce of the\r\nSheep. Impossible likewise to say that she is exercising the sense of\r\ntouch. What delicacy of touch can there be under a coat of horn?\r\nBesides, the most exquisite sensitiveness would be required. Even if we\r\nadmit that the insect’s feet, particularly the tarsi, or the palpi, or\r\nthe antennæ, or anything you please, possess a certain faculty for\r\ndistinguishing between hard and soft, rough and smooth, round and\r\nangular, still our experiment with the Sacred Beetle’s sphere warns us\r\nto look where we are going. There surely we had the exact equivalent of\r\nthe Copris’ sphere—made of the same materials, kneaded to the same\r\nconsistency, given the same outline—and yet the Copris makes no\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nTo drag the sense of taste into the problem would be absurd. There\r\nremains that of hearing. Later on, I might not deny the possibility\r\nthat this has something to do with it. When the larva is hatched, the\r\nmother, ever attentive, might conceivably hear it nibbling the wall of\r\nthe cell, but for the present the chamber contains merely an egg; and\r\nan egg is always silent.\r\n\r\nThen what other means does the mother possess, I will not say of\r\nthwarting my machinations—the problem is on a loftier plane and animals\r\nare not endowed with special aptitudes in order to dodge an\r\nexperimenter’s wiles—what other means does she possess of obviating the\r\ndifficulties attendant upon her normal labours? Do not lose sight of\r\nthis: she begins by shaping a sphere; and the globular mass often does\r\nnot differ from the pills that have received the egg, in respect of\r\neither form or size.\r\n\r\nNowhere is there peace, not even below ground. When, in a moment of\r\npanic, the too-timid mother falls off her sphere and forsakes it to\r\nseek refuge elsewhere, how can she afterwards find her ball again and\r\ndistinguish it from the others, without running the risk of crushing an\r\negg when she is pressing in the top of a pill to make the necessary\r\ncrater? She needs a safe guide here. What is that guide? I do not know.\r\n\r\nI have said it many a time and I say it again: insects possess\r\nsense-faculties of exquisite delicacy attuned to their special trade,\r\nfaculties of which we can form no conception because we have nothing\r\nsimilar within ourselves. A man blind from birth can have no notion of\r\ncolour. We are as men blind from birth in the face of the unfathomable\r\nmysteries that surround us; and myriads of questions arise to which no\r\nanswer can ever be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH COPRIS: THE HABITS OF THE MOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two special points to be remembered in the life-history of\r\nthe Spanish Copris: the rearing of her family; and her pill-rolling\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nFirst, the output of her ovaries is extremely limited; and nevertheless\r\nher race thrives just as much as that of many others whose seed is\r\nnumerous. Maternal care makes up for the small number of her eggs.\r\nProlific layers, after making a few rough and ready arrangements,\r\nabandon their progeny to luck, which often sacrifices a thousand in\r\norder to preserve one; they are factories turning out organic matter\r\nfor life’s comprehensive maw. Almost as soon as hatched, or even before\r\nhatching, their offspring for the most part perish devoured.\r\nExtermination makes short work of superfluity in the interests of the\r\ncommunity at large. That which was destined to live lives, but under\r\nanother form. These excessive breeders know and can know nothing of\r\nmaternal affection.\r\n\r\nThe Copres have other and fundamentally different habits. Three or four\r\neggs represent their entire posterity. How are they to be preserved, to\r\na great extent, from the accidents that await them? For them, so few in\r\nnumbers, as for the others, whose name is legion, existence is an\r\ninexorable struggle. The mother knows it and, in order to save her\r\nnearest and dearest, sacrifices herself, giving up outdoor pleasures,\r\nnocturnal flights and that supreme delight of her race, the\r\ninvestigation of a fresh heap of dung. Hidden underground, by the side\r\nof her brood, she never leaves her nursery. She keeps watch; she\r\nbrushes off the parasitic growths; she closes up the cracks; she drives\r\noff any ravagers that may appear: Acari, [34] tiny Staphylini, [35]\r\ngrubs of small Flies, Aphodii, [36] Onthophagi. [37] In September she\r\nclimbs to the surface with her family, which, having no further use for\r\nher, emancipates itself and henceforth lives as it pleases. No bird\r\ncould be a more devoted mother.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Copris’ abrupt transformation at laying-time into an\r\nexpert pill-maker provides us, in so far as we are able to get at the\r\ntruth, with a proof of the theorem which I was almost afraid to\r\nformulate just now. Here is a Beetle not equipped for the pill-roller’s\r\nart, an art moreover which is not required for her individual\r\nprosperity. She has no aptitude, no propensity for kneading the food\r\nwhich she buries and consumes as she finds it; she is totally ignorant\r\nof the sphere and its properties in connection with food-preservation;\r\nand, all of a sudden, in obedience to an inspiration for which nothing,\r\nin the ordinary course of her life, has prepared the way, she moulds\r\ninto a sphere or ovoid the legacy which she bequeaths to her grub. With\r\nher short, clumsy fore-leg she shapes the viaticum of her offspring\r\ninto a skilful solid mass. The difficulty is great. It is overcome by\r\ndint of application and patience. In two days, or three at most, the\r\nround cradle is perfected. How does the dumpy creature go to work to\r\nachieve mathematical exactness in her ball? The Sacred Beetle has her\r\nlong legs, which serve as compasses; the Gymnopleurus has similar\r\ntools. But the Copris, unprovided with the spread of limb which would\r\nenable her to encircle the object, finds nothing in her equipment that\r\nfavours the formation of a sphere. Perched upon her ovoid, she labours\r\nat it bit by bit with an intensity that makes up for her defective\r\nimplements; she estimates the correctness of its curve by assiduous\r\ntactile examinations from one end to the other. Perseverance triumphs\r\nover clumsiness and achieves what at first seemed impossible.\r\n\r\nHere all my readers will assail me with the same questions: why this\r\nabrupt change in the insect’s habits? Why this indefatigable patience\r\nin a form of work that bears no relation to the tools at hand? And what\r\nis the use of this ovoid shape whose perfection demands so great an\r\noutlay of time?\r\n\r\nTo these queries I see only one possible reply: the preservation of the\r\nfoodstuffs in a fresh condition demands the globular form. Remember\r\nthis: the Copris builds her nest in June; her larva develops during the\r\ndog-days; it lies a few inches below the surface of the ground. In the\r\ncavern, which is now a furnace, the provisions would soon become\r\nuneatable, if the mother did not give them the shape least susceptible\r\nto evaporation. Very different from the Sacred Beetle in habits and\r\nstructure but exposed to the same dangers in her larval state, the\r\nCopris, in order to ward off the peril, adopts the principles of the\r\ngreat pill-roller, principles whose surpassing wisdom we have already\r\nmade manifest.\r\n\r\nI would ask the philosophers to ponder upon these five manufacturers of\r\npreserved meats and the numerous rivals which they doubtless possess in\r\nother climes. I submit to them these inventors of the largest possible\r\nbox with the smallest possible surface for provisions liable to dry;\r\nand I ask them how such logical inspirations and so much rational\r\nforesight can take birth in the obscure brain of the lower orders of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nLet us come down to plain facts. The Copris’ pill is a more or less\r\npronounced ovoid, sometimes differing but slightly from a sphere in\r\nshape. It is not quite so pretty as the work of the Gymnopleurus, which\r\nis very nearly pear-shaped, or at least reminds one of a bird’s egg,\r\nnotably a Sparrow’s, because of the similarity in size. The Copris’\r\nwork is more like the egg of a nocturnal bird of prey, of any member of\r\nthe Owl family, as its projecting end does not stand out conspicuously.\r\n\r\nFrom this pole to the other the ovoid measures, on an average, forty\r\nmillimetres, by thirty-four across. [38] Its whole surface is tightly\r\npacked, hardened by pressure, converted into a crust with a little\r\nearth grained into it. At the projecting end, an attentive eye will\r\ndiscover a ring bristling with short straggling threads. Once the egg\r\nis laid in the cup into which the original sphere is hollowed, the\r\nmother, as I have already said, gradually brings the edges of the\r\ncavity together. This produces the projecting end. To complete the\r\nclosing, she delicately rakes the ovoid and scrapes a little of the\r\nmaterial upwards. This forms the ceiling of the hatching-chamber. At\r\nthe top of this ceiling, which, if it fell in, would destroy the egg,\r\nthe pressure is very slight indeed, leaving an area devoid of rind and\r\ncovered with bits of thread. Immediately under this circle, which is a\r\nsort of porous felt, lies the hatching-chamber, the egg’s little cell,\r\nwhich easily admits air and warmth.\r\n\r\nLike the Sacred Beetle’s egg and those of other Dung-beetles, the\r\nCopris’ egg at once attracts attention by its size, but it grows much\r\nlarger before hatching, increasing two- or threefold in bulk. Its moist\r\nchamber, saturated with the emanations from the provisions, supplies it\r\nwith nourishment. Through the chalky porous shell of the bird’s egg, an\r\nexchange of gases takes place, a respiratory process which quickens\r\nmatter while consuming it. This is a cause of destruction as well as of\r\nlife: the sum total of the contents does not increase under the\r\ninflexible wrapper; on the contrary, it diminishes.\r\n\r\nThings happen otherwise in the Copris’ egg, as in the other\r\nDung-beetles’. We still, no doubt, find the vivifying assistance of the\r\nair; but there is also an accession of new materials which come to add\r\nto the reserves furnished by the ovary. Endosmosis causes the\r\nexhalations of the chamber to penetrate through a very delicate\r\nmembrane, so much so that the egg is fed, swells and enlarges to thrice\r\nits original volume. If we have failed to follow this progressive\r\ngrowth attentively, we are quite surprised at the extraordinary final\r\nsize, which is out of all proportion to that of the mother.\r\n\r\nThis nourishment lasts a fairly long time, for the hatching takes from\r\nfifteen to twenty days. Thanks to the added substance with which the\r\negg has been enriched, the larva is already pretty big when born. We\r\nhave not here the weakly grub, the animated speck which many insects\r\nshow us, but a pretty little creature, at once sturdy and tender,\r\nwhich, happy at being alive, arches its back and frisks and rolls about\r\nin its nest.\r\n\r\nIt is satin-white, with a touch of straw-colour on its skull-cap. I\r\nfind the terminal trowel plainly marked: I mean that slanting plane\r\nwith the scalloped edge whereof the Sacred Beetle has already shown us\r\nthe use when some breach in the cell needs repairing. The implement\r\ntells us the future trade. You also, my attractive little grub, will\r\nbecome a knapsacked excreter, a fervent plasterer manipulating the\r\nstucco supplied by the intestines. But first I will subject you to an\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nNow what are your first mouthfuls? As a rule I see the walls of your\r\nnest shining with a greenish, semifluid wash, a sort of thinly-spread\r\njam. Is this a special dish intended for your delicate baby stomach? Is\r\nit a childish dainty disgorged by the mother? I used to think so when I\r\nfirst began to study the Sacred Beetle. To-day, after seeing a similar\r\nwash in the cells of the various Dung-beetles, including the uncouth\r\nGeotrupes, [39] I wonder whether it is not rather the result of a mere\r\nexudation accumulating on the walls in a sort of dew, the fluid\r\nquintessence filtering through the porous matter.\r\n\r\nThe Copris mother lent herself to observation better than any of the\r\nothers. I have many times surprised her at the moment when, hoisted on\r\nher round pill, she excavates the top in the form of a cup; and I have\r\nnever seen anything that at all suggests a disgorgement. The cavity of\r\nthe bowl, which I lose no time in examining, is just like the rest.\r\nPerhaps I have missed the favourable moment. In any case, I can take\r\nonly a brief glance at the mother’s occupations: all work ceases as\r\nsoon as I raise the cardboard sheath to give light. Under these\r\nconditions the secret might escape me indefinitely. Let us look at the\r\ndifficulty from another angle and enquire whether some special\r\nmilk-food, elaborated in the mother’s stomach, is necessary for the\r\ninfant larva.\r\n\r\nIn one of my cages I rob a Sacred Beetle of her round pill, lately\r\nfashioned and briskly rolled. I strip it at one point of its earthy\r\nlayer and into this clean point I drive the blunt end of a pencil,\r\nmaking a hole a third of an inch deep. I install a newly-hatched\r\nCopris-grub in it. The youngster has not yet taken the least\r\nrefreshment. It is lodged in a cell which in no respect differs from\r\nthe rest of the mass. There is no creamy coating, whether disgorged by\r\nthe mother or merely oozing through. What will result from this change\r\nof quarters?\r\n\r\nNothing untoward. The larva develops and thrives quite as well as in\r\nits native cell. Therefore, when I first started, I was the victim of\r\nan illusion. The delicate wash which nearly always covers the\r\negg-chamber in the Dung-beetles’ work is simply an exudation. The grub\r\nmay be all the better for it, when taking its first mouthfuls; but it\r\nis not indispensable. To-day’s experiment confirms the fact.\r\n\r\nThe grub subjected to this test was put into an open pit. Things cannot\r\nremain in this condition. The absence of ceiling is irksome to the\r\nyoung larva, which loves darkness and tranquillity. How will it set to\r\nwork to build its roof? The mortar-trowel cannot be used as yet, for\r\nmaterials are lacking in the knapsack which so far has done no\r\ndigesting.\r\n\r\nNovice though it be, the little grub has its resources. Since it cannot\r\nbe a plasterer, it becomes a bricklayer. With its legs and mandibles it\r\nremoves particles from the walls of its cell and comes and places them\r\none by one on the rim of the well. The defensive work makes rapid\r\nprogress and the assembled atoms form a vault. It has no strength about\r\nit, I admit; the dome falls in if I merely breathe on it. But soon the\r\nfirst mouthfuls will be swallowed; the intestines will fill; and, well\r\nsupplied, the grub will come and consolidate the work by injecting\r\nmortar into the interstices. Properly cemented, the frail awning\r\nbecomes a solid ceiling.\r\n\r\nLet us leave the tiny grub in peace and consult other larvæ which have\r\nattained half their full growth. With the point of my penknife I pierce\r\nthe pill at the upper end; I open a window a few millimetres square.\r\nThe grub at once appears at the casement, anxiously enquiring into the\r\ndisaster. It rolls itself over in the cell and returns to the opening,\r\nthis time, however, presenting its wide, padded trowel. A jet of mortar\r\nis discharged over the breach. The product is a little too much diluted\r\nand of inferior quality. It runs, it flows in all directions, it does\r\nnot set quickly. A fresh ejaculation follows and another and yet\r\nanother, in swift succession. Useless pains! In vain the plasterer\r\ntries again, in vain it struggles, gathering the trickling material\r\nwith its legs and mandibles: the hole refuses to close. The mortar is\r\nstill too fluid.\r\n\r\nPoor, desperate thing, why don’t you copy your young sister? Do what\r\nthe little larva did just now: build an awning with particles taken\r\nfrom the wall of your house; and your liquid putty will do well on that\r\nspongy scaffolding! The large grub, trusting to its trowel, does not\r\nthink of that method. It exhausts itself, without any appreciable\r\nresult, in trying to effect repairs which the little grub managed most\r\ningeniously. What the baby knew how to do the big larva no longer\r\nknows.\r\n\r\nInsect industry has instances like this of professional methods\r\nemployed at certain periods and then abandoned and utterly forgotten. A\r\nfew days more or less make changes in the creature’s talents. The tiny\r\ngrub, devoid of cement, has bricks to fall back upon: the big larva,\r\nrich in putty, scorns to build, or rather no longer knows how, though\r\nit is even better-endowed than the youngster with the necessary tools.\r\nThe strong one no longer remembers what as a weakling he so well knew\r\nhow to do, only a few days before. A poor power of recollection, if\r\nindeed there be such a power under that flat skull! However, in the\r\nlong run and thanks to the evaporation of the ejected materials, the\r\nshort-memoried plumber ends by stopping up the window. Nearly half a\r\nday has been spent in trowel-work.\r\n\r\nThe idea occurs to me to try whether the mother will come to the\r\ndistressed one’s aid in like circumstances. We have seen her diligently\r\nrestoring the ceiling which I smashed above the egg. Will she do for\r\nthe big grub what she did for the sake of the germ? Will she repair the\r\ntorn pill in which the plasterer is helplessly floundering?\r\n\r\nTo make the experiment more conclusive, I select pills that do not\r\nbelong to the mother entrusted with the work of restoration. I picked\r\nthem up in the fields. They are far from regular, are all dented\r\nbecause of the stony soil on which they lay, a soil not easily\r\nconvertible into a roomy workshop and consequently unsuited to exact\r\ngeometry. They are moreover encrusted with a reddish rind, due to the\r\nferruginous sand in which I packed them in order to avoid dangerous\r\njolting on the road. In short, they differ a good deal from those\r\nelaborated in a jar, with plenty of space around them and on a clean\r\nsupport, pills which are perfect ovoids, free from earthy stains. In\r\nthe top of two of them I make an opening which the grub, faithful to\r\nits methods, at once strives to stop up, but without success. One,\r\nstored away under a bell-glass, will serve me as a witness. The other I\r\nplace in a jar where the mother is watching her cradles, two splendid\r\novoids.\r\n\r\nI have not long to wait. An hour later I raise the cardboard screen.\r\nThe Copris is on the strange pill and so busily engaged that she pays\r\nno attention to the daylight admitted. In other, less urgent\r\ncircumstances, she would at once have slipped down and taken shelter\r\nfrom the troublesome light; this time, she does not move and\r\nimperturbably continues her work. Before my eyes she rakes away the red\r\ncrust and uses the scrapings from the cleansed surface to spread over\r\nand solder the breach. It is hermetically sealed in a very short space\r\nof time. I stand amazed at the insect’s skill.\r\n\r\nWell, while the Copris is restoring a pill that does not belong to her,\r\nwhat is the grub that owns the other doing in the bell-glass? It\r\ncontinues to kick about hopelessly, vainly lavishing cement that is\r\nincapable of setting. Put to the test in the morning, it does not\r\nsucceed until the afternoon in closing the aperture; and then the job\r\nis anything but well done. The borrowed mother, on the other hand, has\r\nnot taken twenty minutes to remedy the accident most excellently.\r\n\r\nShe does even more. After the most important part is finished and the\r\nafflicted grub succoured, she stands all day, all night and the next\r\nday on the newly-closed pill. She brushes it daintily with her tarsi to\r\nget rid of the layer of earth; she obliterates the dents, smooths the\r\nrough places and adjusts the curve, until from a shapeless and soiled\r\npill it becomes an ovoid vying in precision with those which she had\r\nalready manufactured in her glass jar.\r\n\r\nSuch care bestowed upon a strange grub deserves attention. I must go\r\non. I slip into the jar a second pill, similar to the foregoing,\r\nruptured at the top, with an opening larger than on the first occasion,\r\none about a sixteenth of an inch square. The greater the difficulty,\r\nthe more praiseworthy will the restoration be.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, difficult to close. The grub, a fat baby, is wildly\r\ngesticulating and excreting through the window. Leaning over the hole,\r\nits new mother seems to console it. She is like a nurse bending over\r\nthe cradle. Meanwhile her helpful legs are working with a will,\r\nscratching around the yawning aperture to obtain the wherewithal to\r\nstop it. But the materials, half-dried this time, are hard and\r\nunyielding. They are slow in coming; and the quantity is too small for\r\nso big a hole. No matter: what with the grub continuing to shoot forth\r\nits putty and the other mixing it with her own scrapings, to give it\r\nconsistency, and afterwards spreading it, the opening closes up.\r\n\r\nThe thankless task has taken a whole afternoon. It is a good lesson for\r\nme. I shall be more careful in future. I shall choose softer pills and,\r\ninstead of opening them by removing the materials, I shall simply lift\r\nthe wall by shreds until the grub is laid bare. The mother will only\r\nhave to flatten down those shreds and solder them together.\r\n\r\nI act accordingly with a third pill, which is very neatly repaired in a\r\nshort time. Not a trace remains of the ravages caused by my penknife. I\r\ncontinue in the same way with a fourth, a fifth and so on, at intervals\r\nlong enough to give the mother a rest. I stop when the receptacle is\r\nfull, looking like a pot of plums. The contents amount to twelve\r\npieces, of which ten have come from the outside, all ten violated by my\r\npenknife and all restored to good condition by the foster-mother.\r\n\r\nThere are some interesting sidelights to this curious experiment, which\r\nI could have continued if the capacity of the jar had permitted. The\r\nCopris’ zeal, which was not lessened after the restoring of so many\r\nruins, and her diligence, which was the same at the end as in the\r\nbeginning, tell me that I had not exhausted the maternal solicitude.\r\nLet us leave it at that; it is amply sufficient.\r\n\r\nObserve first the arrangement of the pills. Three are enough to occupy\r\nthe floor-space of the enclosure. The others are therefore gradually\r\nsuperposed in layers, making in the end a four-story structure. The\r\nwhole forms an irregular pile, an absolute labyrinth with very narrow,\r\nwinding lanes, through which the insect glides with some difficulty.\r\nWhen her household is in order, the mother stays below, under the pile,\r\ntouching the sand. It is at this moment that a new broken cell is\r\nintroduced, right at the top of the pile, on the third or fourth floor.\r\nLet us put back the screen, wait a few minutes and then go back to the\r\njar.\r\n\r\nThe mother is there, hoisted on the torn pill and doing her utmost to\r\nclose it. How was she informed on the ground-floor of what was\r\nhappening in the attic? How did she know that a larva up there was\r\ncalling for her assistance? The babe in distress screams and the nurse\r\ncomes running up. The grub says nothing; it makes no sound. Its\r\ndesperate gesticulations are not accompanied by any noise. And the\r\nwatcher hears this mute appeal. She notices the silence, she sees the\r\ninvisible. I am bewildered, every one would be bewildered by the\r\nmystery of these perceptions which are so foreign to our nature and\r\nwhich ‘topsy turvy the understanding,’ as Montaigne would say. Let us\r\npass on.\r\n\r\nI have described elsewhere [40] the brutality with which the Bee, that\r\nmost gifted of insects, treats the eggs of her fellows. Osmiæ,\r\nChalicodomæ and others perpetrate atrocities at times. In a moment of\r\nvengeance or of that inexplicable aberration which occurs after the\r\nlaying is finished, a sister’s egg, savagely torn from the cell with\r\nthe pincers of the mandibles, is flung into the dust-bin. The thing is\r\npitilessly crushed, is ripped open, is even eaten. How different from\r\nthe good-natured Copris!\r\n\r\nShall we attribute altruism among families to the Dung-beetle? Shall we\r\ndo her the signal honour of allowing that she administers relief to\r\nfoundlings? That would be madness. The mother who so diligently assists\r\nthe children of others thinks, beyond a doubt, that she is working for\r\nher own. The victim of my experiment had two pills that belonged to\r\nher; my intervention gave her ten more. And, in the jar filled with\r\nprunes to the top, her assiduous care draws no distinction between the\r\nreal household and the casual family. Her intellect therefore is\r\nincapable of the most elementary conception of quantity; she cannot\r\neven distinguish between the singular and the plural, the few and the\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nCan it be because of the darkness? No, for my frequent visits give the\r\nCopris an opportunity, when the opaque screen is lifted, of looking\r\naround her and discovering the strange accumulation, that is if light\r\nbe really the guide which she lacks. Besides, has she not another means\r\nof information? In the natural burrow, the pills, three or at most four\r\nin number, all lie on the ground, forming one row only. With my\r\nadditions they pile up into four stories.\r\n\r\nIn order to clamber to the top, in order to hoist herself up through\r\nsuch a maze as never Copris mansion knew before, the Beetle must rub\r\nagainst and touch the units of the heap. But she counts none the better\r\nfor that. To the insect all this is just the home, is just the family,\r\nworthy of the same care at the summit as at the base. The twelve\r\nproduced by my trickery and the two of her own laying are the same\r\nthing in her arithmetic.\r\n\r\nI present this strange mathematician to any one who comes and talks to\r\nme of a glimmer of reason in the insect, as Darwin claimed. It is one\r\nof two things: either this glimmer does not exist, or else the Copris\r\nreasons divinely and becomes a St. Vincent de Paul of insects, moved to\r\npity by the sad lot of the homeless. Make your choice.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that, rather than abandon the principle, men will not\r\nshrink from sheer folly and that the compassionate Copris will one day\r\nfigure in the evolutionists’ Book of Moral Deeds. Why not? Does it not\r\nalready, with an eye to the same argument, contain a certain\r\ntender-hearted Boa Constrictor who, on losing his master, lay down and\r\ndied of grief? Oh, the fond reptile! These edifying stories, compiled\r\nwith the object of tracing man back to the Gorilla, procure me a few\r\nmoments of mild amusement when I come across them. But we will not\r\nlabour the point.\r\n\r\nBetter that you and I, friend Copris, should speak of things that do\r\nnot raise storms. Would you mind telling me the reason of the\r\nreputation which you enjoyed in the days of antiquity? Ancient Egypt\r\nextolled you in pink granite and porphyry; she venerated you, O my fair\r\nhorned one, and awarded you honours similar to the Scarab’s! You ranked\r\nsecond in the entomological hierarchy.\r\n\r\nHorapollo tells us of two Sacred Beetles with horns. One sported a\r\nsingle specimen on her head, the other had two. The first is you, the\r\ninmate of my glass jars, or at least some one very like you. If Egypt\r\nhad known what you have just taught me, she would certainly have placed\r\nyou above the Scarab, that roving pill-roller who deserts her home and\r\nleaves her family, after it has received its inheritance, to shift for\r\nitself as best it can. Knowing nothing of your wonderful habits, which\r\nhistory is noting for the first time, she deserves all the greater\r\npraise for having divined your merits.\r\n\r\nThe second, the one with two horns, would, according to the experts,\r\nappear to be the insect which the naturalists call the Isis Copris. I\r\nknow her only in effigy, but her image is so striking that I sometimes\r\ncatch myself dreaming late in life, just as I did in my youth, of going\r\ndown to Nubia and exploring the banks of the Nile, in order to\r\ncross-examine, under some lump of Camel-dung, the insect that is\r\nemblematic of Isis the divine brooder, nature made fruitful by Osiris,\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nOh, simpleton! Attend to your cabbages, sow your turnips: that won’t do\r\nyou any harm; water your lettuces; and understand, once and for all,\r\nhow vain are all our questionings when it is simply a matter of\r\nenquiring into a muck-raker’s sagacity! Be less ambitious; confine\r\nyourself to setting down facts.\r\n\r\nSo be it. There is nothing striking to be said of the larva, which is a\r\nreplica of the Sacred Beetle’s, save for some minute details which do\r\nnot interest us here. It has the same hump in the middle of its back,\r\nthe same slanting truncature of the last segment, expanding into a\r\ntrowel on the upper surface. A ready excreter, it understands, though\r\nless thoroughly than the other, the art of stopping up breaches to\r\nprotect itself from draughts. The larval state covers a period of four\r\nto six weeks.\r\n\r\nAt the end of July the nymph appears, first amber-yellow all over, next\r\ncurrant-red on the head, horn, corselet, breast and legs, while the\r\nwing-cases have the pale hue of gum arabic. A month later, by the end\r\nof August, the perfect insect releases itself from its mummy wrappers.\r\nIts costume, now wrought upon by delicate chemical changes, is quite as\r\nstrange as that of the new-born Sacred Beetle. Head, corselet, breast\r\nand legs are chestnut-red. The horn, the epistoma and the\r\ndenticulations of the fore-legs are shaded with brown. The wing-cases\r\nare a rather yellowish white. The abdomen is white, excepting only the\r\nanal segment, which is an even brighter red than the thorax. I perceive\r\nthis early colouring of the anal segment, while the rest of the abdomen\r\nis still quite pale, in the Sacred Beetles, the Gymnopleuri, the\r\nOnthophagi, the Geotrupes, the Cetoniæ [41] and many others. Whence\r\nthis precocity? One more note of interrogation which will long stand\r\nawaiting a reply.\r\n\r\nA fortnight passes. The costume becomes ebon-black, the cuirass\r\nhardens. The insect is ready for the emergence. We are at the end of\r\nSeptember; the earth has drunk in a few showers which soften the\r\nstubborn shell and allow of an easy deliverance. This is the moment,\r\nprisoners mine. If I have teased you a little, at least I have kept you\r\nin plenty. Your shells have hardened in your cages and have become\r\ncaskets which your own efforts will never succeed in forcing open. I\r\nwill come to your aid. Let us describe in detail how things happen.\r\n\r\nOnce the burrow is supplied with the voluminous loaf out of which three\r\nor four pilular rations are to be carved, the mother does not appear\r\noutside again. Besides, there is no provision made for her. The heap\r\nstored away below is the family cake, the exclusive patrimony of the\r\ngrubs, who will receive equal shares. For four months, therefore, the\r\nrecluse is without food of any kind.\r\n\r\nIt is a voluntary privation. Victuals are there, within reach, copious\r\nand of superior quality; but they are intended for the larvæ and the\r\nmother will take good care not to touch them: anything abstracted for\r\nher own use would mean so much less for the grubs. Gluttonous at the\r\noutset, when there was no family to consider, she now becomes very\r\nabstemious, even to the point of prolonged fasting. The Hen sitting on\r\nher eggs forgets to eat for some weeks; the watchful Copris mother\r\nforgets it during a third part of the year. The Dung-beetle outdoes the\r\nbird in maternal self-abnegation.\r\n\r\nNow what does this self-sacrificing mother do underground? To what\r\nhousehold cares can she devote the period of so long a fast? My\r\nappliances provide a satisfactory answer. I possess, as I have said,\r\ntwo kinds. One consists of glass jars with a thin layer of sand and a\r\ncardboard case to create darkness; the other of large pots filled with\r\nearth and closed with a pane of glass.\r\n\r\nAt any moment when I raise the opaque sheath of the first, I find the\r\nmother now perched upon the top of her ovoids, now on the ground,\r\nhalf-erect, smoothing the bulging curve with her fore-leg. On rarer\r\noccasions, she is dozing in the midst of the heap.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which she employs her time is obvious. She watches her\r\ntreasure of pills; her inquisitive antennæ sound them to discover what\r\nis happening inside; she listens to the nurselings growing; she touches\r\nup faulty spots; she polishes and repolishes the surfaces in order to\r\ndelay the desiccation within until the development of the inmates is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThese scrupulous cares, cares occupying every moment, have results\r\nwhich would strike the attention of the least-experienced observer. The\r\negg-shaped vessels, or better the cradles of the nursery, are wonderful\r\nin their regular curves and in their neatness. We see none of those\r\nchinks with a blob of putty showing through, none of those cracks, of\r\nthose peeling scales, in short none of those defects which, towards the\r\nend, nearly always disfigure the Sacred Beetle’s pears, handsome though\r\nthey be at the start.\r\n\r\nThe horned Dung-beetle’s caskets could not be better shaped, even after\r\nthey are thoroughly dried up, if they had been worked in plaster by a\r\nmodeller. What pretty, dark-bronze eggs they are, rivalling the Owl’s\r\nin size and form! This irreproachable perfection, maintained until the\r\nshell is burst by the emerging larva, is obtained only by incessant\r\ntouching up, interspersed at long intervals with periods of rest during\r\nwhich the mother composes herself for a nap at the foot of the heap.\r\n\r\nThe glass jars leave room for doubt. It is possible to say that the\r\ninsect, imprisoned in an impassable enclosure, stays in the midst of\r\nits pills because it is unable to go elsewhere. I agree; but there\r\nremains that work of polishing and of continual inspection about which\r\nthe mother need not trouble at all if these cares did not form part of\r\nher habits. Were she solely anxious to recover her liberty, she ought\r\nto be roaming restlessly all round the enclosure, whereas I always see\r\nher very quiet and absorbed. The only evidence of her excitement, when\r\nthe raising of the cardboard cylinder suddenly produces daylight, is\r\nthat she lets herself slide from the top of a pill and hides in the\r\nheap. If I moderate the light, composure is soon restored and she\r\nresumes her position on the summit, there to continue the work which my\r\nvisit interrupted.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the evidence of the apparatus that is always in darkness\r\nis conclusive. The mother buried herself in June in the sand of my pots\r\nwith copious provisions, which are soon converted into a certain number\r\nof pills. She is at liberty to return to the surface when she pleases.\r\nShe will there find broad daylight under the big sheet of glass which\r\nensures me against her escape; she will find food, which I renew from\r\ntime to time in order to entice her.\r\n\r\nWell, neither the daylight nor the food, desirable though this must\r\nseem to be after a fast so long extended, is able to tempt her. Nothing\r\nstirs in my pots, nothing rises to the surface until the rains come.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly probable that exactly the same thing happens\r\nunderground as in the jars. To make certain, I inspect some of my\r\nappliances at different periods. I always find the mother beside her\r\npills, in a spacious cave which gives free play to the watcher’s\r\nevolutions. She could go lower down in the sand and hide anywhere she\r\npleased, if rest is what she wants; she could climb outside and sit\r\ndown to fresh victuals, if refreshment became necessary. Neither the\r\nprospects of rest in a deeper crypt nor the thought of the sun and of\r\nnice soft rolls make her leave her family. Until the last of her\r\noffspring has burst his shell, she sticks to her post in the\r\nbirth-chamber.\r\n\r\nIt is now October. The rains so greatly desired by man and beast have\r\ncome at last, soaking the ground to some depth. After the torrid and\r\ndusty days of summer, when life is in suspense, we have the coolness\r\nthat revives it, we have the last festival of the year. In the midst of\r\nthe heath putting out its first pink bells, the oronge [42] splits its\r\nwhite purse and comes into view, looking like the yolk of an egg half\r\ndeprived of its albumen; the massive purple boletus turns blue under\r\nthe heel of the passer-by who crushes it; the autumnal squill lifts its\r\nlittle spike of lilac flowers; the strawberry-tree’s coral balls begin\r\nto soften.\r\n\r\nThis tardy springtime has its echoes underground. The vernal\r\ngenerations, Sacred Beetles and Gymnopleuri, Onthophagi and Copres,\r\nhasten to burst their shells softened by the damp and come to the\r\nsurface to take part in the gaieties of the last fine weather.\r\n\r\nMy captives are denied the friendly shower. The cement of their\r\ncaskets, baked by the summer heat, is too hard to yield. The file of\r\nthe shield and legs would make no impression on it. I come to the poor\r\nthings’ assistance. A carefully graduated watering replaces the natural\r\nrain in my glass and earthenware pots. To ascertain once more the\r\neffects of water on the Dung-beetles’ deliverance, I leave a few of the\r\nreceptacles in the state of dryness for which they have to thank the\r\ndog-days.\r\n\r\nThe result of my sprinkling soon becomes apparent. In a few days’ time,\r\nnow in one jar, now in another, the pills, properly softened, open and\r\nfall to pieces under the prisoner’s efforts. The new-born Copris\r\nappears and sits down, with his mother, to the food which I have placed\r\nat his disposal.\r\n\r\nWhen the hermit, stiffening his legs and humping his back, tries to\r\nsplit the ceiling that presses down on him, does the mother come to his\r\nassistance by delivering an assault from the outside? It is quite\r\npossible. The watcher, hitherto so careful of her brood, so attentive\r\nto what is happening within the pills, can hardly fail to hear the\r\nsounds made by the captive in his struggles to emerge.\r\n\r\nWe have seen her indefatigably stopping the holes caused by my\r\nindiscretion; we have seen her, often enough, restoring for the grub’s\r\ngreater safety the pill which I had opened with my penknife. Fitted by\r\ninstinct for repairing and building, why should she not be fitted for\r\ndemolishing? However, I will make no assertions, for I have been unable\r\nto see. The favourable conditions always escaped me: I came either too\r\nlate or too early. And then let us not forget that the admission of\r\nlight usually interrupts the work.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the sand-filled pots, the liberation must take place\r\nin the same way. All that I am able to witness is the insect’s\r\nemergence above ground. Attracted by the smell of fresh provisions\r\nwhich I have served on the threshold of the burrow, the newly-released\r\nfamily emerge gradually, accompanied by the mother, wander round for a\r\ntime under the pane of glass and then attack the pile.\r\n\r\nThere are three or four of them, five at most. The sons are easily\r\nrecognized by the greater length of their horns; but there is nothing\r\nto distinguish the daughters from the mother. For that matter, the same\r\nconfusion prevails among themselves. An abrupt change of attitude has\r\ntaken place; and the erstwhile devoted mother is now utterly\r\nindifferent to the welfare of her emancipated family. Henceforward each\r\nlooks after his own home and his own interests. They no longer know one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIn the receptacles which are not moistened by artificial showers,\r\nthings come to a miserable end. The dry shell, almost as hard as an\r\napricot- or peach-stone, offers indomitable resistance. The insect’s\r\nlegs manage to grate off barely so much as a pinch of dust. I hear the\r\ntools rasping against the unyielding wall; then silence follows and not\r\na prisoner survives to tell the tale. The mother too perishes in that\r\nhome which has remained dry when the season for dryness has passed. The\r\nCopris, like the Sacred Beetle, needs the rain to soften the granite\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nTo return to the liberated ones. When the emergence is effected, the\r\nmother, we were saying, ceases to trouble about them. Her present\r\nindifference, however, must not make us forget the wonderful care which\r\nshe has lavished for four months on end. Outside the Social\r\nHymenoptera—Bees, Wasps, Ants and so on—who spoon-feed their young and\r\nbring them up according to scrupulously hygienic methods, where in the\r\ninsect world shall we find another example of such maternal\r\nself-abnegation, of such wise and tender care for the offspring? I know\r\nof none.\r\n\r\nHow did the Copris acquire this lofty quality, which I would readily\r\ncall a moral quality, if morality and nescience had any point of\r\ncontact? How did she learn to surpass in tenderness the Bee and the\r\nAnt, both so greatly renowned? I say surpass. The mother Bee, indeed,\r\nis simply a germ-factory, a prodigiously fertile factory, I admit. She\r\nlays eggs; and that is all. The family is brought up by others, real\r\nsisters of charity these, vowed to celibacy.\r\n\r\nThe Copris mother does more in her humble household. Alone and entirely\r\nunaided, she provides each of her children with a cake whose crust,\r\nhardening and constantly renovated with the maternal trowel, becomes an\r\ninviolable cradle. So intense is her affection that she neglects\r\nherself to the extent of losing all need for food. Down in a burrow,\r\nfor four consecutive months, she watches over her brood, attending to\r\nthe wants of the germ, the grub, the nymph and the perfect insect. She\r\ndoes not return to the glad outer life until all her family are\r\nemancipated. Thus do we behold one of the most brilliant manifestations\r\nof maternal instinct in a humble dung-eater. The Spirit breatheth where\r\nhe will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nONTHOPHAGI AND ONITICELLI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the notabilities of the Dung-beetle tribe, if we omit the\r\nGeotrupes, who belong to a different clan, there remains, within the\r\nvery limited radius of my observation, the Onthophagus rabble, of which\r\nI could gather a dozen different species around my house. What will\r\nthese small fry teach us?\r\n\r\nEven more zealous than their big companions, they are the first that\r\nhasten to exploit the heap left by the passing Mule. They come in\r\ncrowds and stay a long time working under the spread table that gives\r\nthem shade and coolness. Turn over the heap with your foot. You will be\r\nsurprised at the swarming population whose presence no outward sign\r\nbetrayed. The largest are scarce the size of a pea, but some are much\r\nsmaller still; and these dwarfs are no less busy than the others, no\r\nless eager to crumble into dust the filth which, in the interests of\r\nthe public health, must be cleared away with all speed.\r\n\r\nFor the more important work of life there is nothing like the humble\r\ntoilers for realizing vast strength, made up of their joint weaknesses.\r\nSwollen by numbers, the next to nothing becomes an enormous total.\r\n\r\nHurrying in detachments at the first news of the event, assisted\r\nmoreover in their sanitary work by their partners, the Aphodii, who are\r\nas weak as they, the tiny Onthophagi soon clear the ground of its dirt.\r\nNot that their appetite is equal to the consumption of such plentiful\r\nprovisions. What food do these pigmies need? A mere atom. But for that\r\natom, selected from among the exudations, search must be made amid the\r\nwisps of masticated fodder. Hence, an endless division and dissection\r\nof the lump, reducing it to dust which the sun sterilizes and the wind\r\ndispels. As soon as the work is done—and very well done—the troop of\r\nscavengers goes in search of another refuse-yard. Except for the period\r\nof intense cold, which puts a stop to all activity, they are never\r\nidle.\r\n\r\nAnd do not run away with the idea that this filthy task entails an\r\ninelegant shape and a ragged dress. Our squalor is unknown to the\r\ninsect. In its world, a navvy dons a sumptuous jerkin; an undertaker\r\ndecks himself in a triple saffron sash; a wood-cutter works in a velvet\r\ncoat. In like manner, the Onthophagus has his special gorgeousness.\r\nTrue, the costume is always severe: brown and black are the predominant\r\ncolours, now dull, now polished as ebony. That is the general\r\ngroundwork, but how chaste and elegant are the decorative details!\r\n\r\nOne (O. lemur) has wing-cases of a light chestnut colour, with a\r\nsemicircle of black dots; a second (O. nuchicornis) has similar\r\nchestnut wing-cases covered with splashes of Indian ink not unlike the\r\nsquare Hebrew characters; a third (O. Schreberi), who is a glossy black\r\nlike that of jet, decks himself with four vermilion cockades; a fourth\r\n(O. furcatus) lights up the tip of his short wing-cases with a gleam\r\nsimilar to that of dying embers; many (O. vacca, O. cænobita and\r\nothers) have corselets and heads bright with the metal sheen of\r\nFlorentine bronze.\r\n\r\nThe graver’s work completes the beauty of the dress. Dainty chasing in\r\nparallel grooves, delicate embroidery, knotty chaplets are distributed\r\nin profusion among nearly all of them. Yes, the little Onthophagi, with\r\ntheir short bodies and their nimble activity, are really pretty to look\r\nat.\r\n\r\nAnd then how original are their frontal decorations! These peace-lovers\r\ndelight in the panoply of war, as though they, the inoffensive ones,\r\nthirsted for battle. Many of them crown their heads with threatening\r\nhorns. Let us mention a couple of the horned ones whose story will\r\noccupy us more particularly. I mean, first, the Bull Onthophagus (O.\r\ntaurus), clad in raven black. He wears a pair of long horns, gracefully\r\ncurved and branching to either side. No pedigree bull, in the Swiss\r\nmeadows, can match them for curve or elegance. The second is the Forked\r\nOnthophagus (O. furcatus), who is much smaller. His equipment consists\r\nof a fork with three vertical prongs.\r\n\r\nThere you have the two chief subjects of this brief Onthophagus\r\nbiography. The others are equally worthy of being chronicled. From\r\nfirst to last, they would all supply us with interesting details, some\r\nof them even with peculiarities unknown elsewhere; but we must draw the\r\nline somewhere in this multitude, which is difficult to observe in the\r\naggregate. And there is this more serious circumstance, that my choice\r\nhas not been free: I have had to content myself with the few lucky\r\ndiscoveries made as the result of chance encounters out of doors and\r\nwith the few successful experiments made in the vivarium.\r\n\r\nTwo species only, the two which I have named, have proved satisfactory\r\nin both directions. Let us watch them at work. They will show us the\r\nprincipal features of the manner of life led by the whole tribe, for\r\nthey occupy the two extremes of the scale of sizes, the Bull\r\nOnthophagus being one of the largest and the Forked Onthophagus one of\r\nthe smallest.\r\n\r\nWe will speak first of the nest. Contrary to my expectation, the\r\nOnthophagi are indifferent nest-builders. With them we find no spheres\r\nrolled joyously in the sunshine, no ovoids manipulated laboriously in\r\nan underground workshop. Their business, that of reducing filth to\r\ndust, appears to give them so much to do that they have no time left\r\nfor work demanding prolonged patience. They confine themselves to what\r\nis strictly necessary and most rapidly obtained.\r\n\r\nA perpendicular well is dug, a couple of inches deep, cylindrical in\r\nshape and varying in bore according to the size of the well-sinker. The\r\npit of the Forked Onthophagus has the diameter of a lead-pencil; that\r\nof the Bull Onthophagus is twice the width. Right at the bottom are the\r\ngrub’s provisions, plastered against the walls in a tightly-packed\r\nheap. The total lack of free space at the sides of the pile shows how\r\nthe provisioning is done. There is not a sign of a niche, of the least\r\ncorner that would leave the mother enough liberty of movement to knead\r\nand mould her bun. The material therefore is simply pressed down at the\r\nbottom of the cylindrical sheath, where it takes the shape of a full\r\nthimble.\r\n\r\nI dig up some nests of the Forked Onthophagus near the end of July. It\r\nis a crude piece of work, which surprises you by its roughness when you\r\nthink of the neat little worker. Wisps of hay, sticking out anyhow,\r\nincrease the untidy look of things. The nature of the materials,\r\nsupplied this time by the Mule, are partly the cause of this ugly\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe length of these nests is fourteen millimetres, the width seven.\r\n[43] The upper surface is slightly concave, proving that the pressure\r\nhas been exercised by the mother. The lower end is rounded like the\r\nbottom of the well which serves as a mould. I take a needle and with\r\nthe point of it I pick the rustic structure to pieces. The mass of\r\nfoodstuff occupies the base, forming the lower two-thirds of the\r\nthimble into a compact block; the cell containing the egg is at the\r\ntop, under a thin, concave lid.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing fresh about the work of the Bull Onthophagus, which,\r\nsave for being larger, differs in no way from that of the Forked\r\nOnthophagus. I am unacquainted with the insect’s modus operandi. As\r\nregards the inner secrets of nest-building, these dwarfs are as\r\nreticent as their big colleagues. One alone satisfied my curiosity, or\r\nnearly; and then it was not an Onthophagus but a kindred species, the\r\nYellow-footed Oniticellus (O. flavipes).\r\n\r\nI capture her in the last week of July, under a heap which a Mule\r\nemployed in treading out the corn on the thrashing-floor dropped during\r\na rest from work. The thick blanket, transformed by a hot sun into an\r\nincomparable incubator, shelters a host of Onthophagi. The Oniticellus\r\nis by herself. Her quick retreat down a yawning well attracts my\r\nattention. I dig to a depth of about two inches and extract the lady of\r\nthe house together with her work, the latter in a sadly damaged\r\ncondition. I can, however, distinguish a sort of bag.\r\n\r\nI install the Oniticellus in a tumbler, on a layer of heaped earth, and\r\ngive her as her nest-building materials what the Sacred Beetles and the\r\nCopres prefer, the Sheep’s plastic paste. Caught at the moment when she\r\nwas about to lay, goaded by the irresistible needs of her ovaries, the\r\nmother lends herself very obligingly to my wishes. She lays four eggs\r\nin three days. This rapidity, which would doubtless be even greater if\r\nmy curiosity had not disturbed her in her task, is explained by the\r\nsimplicity of the work.\r\n\r\nThe mother goes to the lower surface of the stuff which I have supplied\r\nand detaches from the central and softest part a slice sufficient for\r\nher plans, removing it all in one piece, by means of a circular\r\nsection. It is the same method as that employed by the Copris taking\r\nfrom her loaf the wherewithal to make a pellet. There is a pit\r\nimmediately below, dug in advance. The Oniticellus goes down it with\r\nher burden.\r\n\r\nI wait half an hour, to give the work time to take shape, and then turn\r\nthe glass upside down, hoping to surprise the mother in her domestic\r\nbusiness. The original little lump is now a bag moulded by pressure\r\nagainst the sides of the well. The mother is at the bottom, motionless,\r\nbewildered by my disturbing visit and the intrusion of light. To see\r\nher working with her forehead and legs in order to spread the matter,\r\ncrush it and apply it to its earthen sheath seems to me a very\r\ndifficult thing to do. I abandon the attempt and restore the glass to\r\nits first position.\r\n\r\nA little later, I make a second examination, when the mother has left\r\nher burrow. The work is now finished. The outward form is that of a\r\nthimble fifteen millimetres deep by ten wide. [44] The flat end has all\r\nthe appearance of a lid fitted to the opening and carefully soldered\r\non. The rounded lower half of the thimble is full. This is the grub’s\r\nlarder. Above is the hatching-chamber, with the egg sticking up from\r\nthe floor, fixed perpendicularly by one end.\r\n\r\nGreat is the danger for the Oniticellus and the Onthophagus, offspring\r\nof the dog-days, both of them. Their jar of preserves is greatly\r\nrestricted in volume. Its shape is in no way calculated to reduce\r\nevaporation; it is too near the surface of the soil to escape the\r\ndangerous dryness of the air. If the cake should harden, the grub will\r\ndie, after its abstinence has been prolonged to the utmost limits of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nI place in glass tubes, which will represent the native well, a few\r\nOnthophagus- and Oniticellus-thimbles, first contriving an opening in\r\nthe side which will enable me to see what happens within. I close the\r\ntubes with a plug of cotton and keep them in a shady part of my study.\r\nEvaporation must be very slight in these impermeable and moreover\r\nplugged sheaths. Nevertheless it is enough to produce in a few days a\r\ndegree of dryness which is fatal to feeding.\r\n\r\nI see the starvelings remain motionless, unable to bite into the\r\nhateful crust; I see them lose their plumpness, I see them wrinkle and\r\nshrivel, and at last, in a fortnight’s time, take on all the appearance\r\nof death. I replace the dry cotton with wet cotton. The atmosphere in\r\nthe tubes becomes damp; the thimbles are gradually saturated with the\r\nmoisture, swell out and soften; and the dying come back to life. They\r\ndo so to such good purpose that the whole cycle of the metamorphoses is\r\nsafely accomplished, on condition that the wet cotton be renewed from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\nMy carefully graduated artificial shower, with its damped cotton to\r\nrepresent the clouds, inspires that return to life. It is like a\r\nresurrection. In the normal conditions prevailing in the torrid,\r\nrain-grudging month of August, the probability of an equivalent of that\r\nshower is almost nil. How then is the fatal drying-up of the victuals\r\navoided? To begin with, there are, so it seems to me, certain gifts\r\nbestowed on these little ones so inadequately protected by their\r\nmother’s industry against the enemy, drought. I have seen Onthophagus-\r\nand Oniticellus-larvæ recover their appetite, their plumpness and their\r\nvigour under the wet cotton, after a three weeks’ fast that had reduced\r\nthem to a wrinkled pilule. This faculty of endurance has its uses: it\r\nenables the possessor to await, in a state of lethargy akin to death,\r\nthe few, very uncertain drops of rain that will put an end to the\r\nfamine. It comes to the grub’s rescue, but it is not sufficient: the\r\nprosperity of a race cannot be based upon privation.\r\n\r\nThere is something more, therefore; and this is furnished by the\r\nmother’s instinct. Whereas the manufacturers of pears and ovoids always\r\ndig their burrow at an open spot, with no other protection than the\r\nmound of earth flung up, the makers of little thimbles bore their well\r\ndirectly under the material exploited and go by preference to the\r\nvoluminous droppings of the Horse and the Mule. Under this thick\r\nmattress, the soil, protected against sun and wind, keeps fresh and\r\ndamp for some little time, steeped as it is in the moisture from the\r\ndung.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, the danger does not last long. The egg yields up the\r\ngrub in less than a week; and the larva attains its full development\r\nwithin a dozen days or so, if nothing untoward happens. This makes\r\nabout twenty days in all for the critical period of the Onthophagus and\r\nthe Oniticellus. What does it matter if the walls of the emptied\r\nthimble do dry after that! The nymph will be all the better off in a\r\nsolid casket, which will easily crumble to bits later, when, with the\r\nfirst September rains, the insect effects its release.\r\n\r\nIn appearance and habits the grub resembles that which the Sacred\r\nBeetle and the others have introduced to us. It possesses the same\r\naptitude for defending the cell against the dangerous intrusion of the\r\ndry air; the same zeal, the same nimbleness in cementing the least\r\nbreach with the putty of the intestines; the same knapsack hunching the\r\nmiddle of the back.\r\n\r\nThe grub of the Oniticellus has the most remarkable hump of all. Would\r\nyou care to have a quick and yet a faithful sketch of it? Draw a short,\r\nwrinkled sausage. About the middle of this sausage, on the side, graft\r\nan appendix. There you have the beast, in three almost equal parts. The\r\nlower portion is the abdomen; the upper, where you are at first\r\ninclined to look for the head, so clearly does it appear to be a\r\ncontinuation of the part below, is the hump, the inordinate,\r\nextravagant hump, bigger than caricaturist ever dared conceive in the\r\nwildest flights of his imagination. It occupies the place which by\r\nrights belongs to the chest and head. Then where are these? Thrust\r\naside by the monstrous knapsack, they constitute a lateral appendage, a\r\nmere knob. The strange creature bends at right angles under the weight\r\nof its hump.\r\n\r\nWhen nature goes in for the grotesque, she leaves us behind. Is\r\ngrotesque the right word? I have seen representations of Monkeys\r\nadorned with preposterous noses which Rabelais, for all his inspired\r\nvision of the huge, never conceived; and this though he invented the\r\nnose ‘like the beak of a limbeck, in every part thereof most variously\r\ndiapered with the twinkling sparkles of crimson blisters budding forth,\r\nand purpled with pimples all enamelled with thick-set wheals of a\r\nsanguine colour, bordered with gules.’ [45] I know some who are all\r\nscrubby with shock-headed wigs and whiskers and imperials in which\r\nevery hairy drollery seems to be epitomized; and yet there is not a\r\ndoubt that noses ‘like the beak of a limbeck’ and bristly faces are\r\nhighly admired in the simian clan. There is no boundary between the\r\nfashionable and the grotesque. It all depends upon the appraiser.\r\n\r\nIf the grub with the outrageous hump were to show itself in public, it\r\nwould doubtless represent the supreme expression of the beautiful in\r\nthe eyes of the Oniticellus and the Onthophagus. Because it is a\r\nrecluse, nobody sees it. Its charms would remain unknown but for the\r\nphilosophical observer, who says to himself:\r\n\r\n‘Everything is good that harmonizes with the functions to be fulfilled.\r\nThe grub requires a cement-bag to safeguard its provisions against\r\ndesiccation; it is born with a knapsack on its back so that it may\r\nlive.’\r\n\r\nThus is the hump excused and abundantly justified.\r\n\r\nIts usefulness is displayed from another point of view. The thimble is\r\nof such a niggardly size that the grub consumes it almost entirely. All\r\nthat remains is a thin layer, a crumbling remnant which would provide\r\nno security for the nymph. The ruined dwelling has to be strengthened,\r\nto be lined with a new wall. For this purpose, the larva of the\r\nOniticellus empties the whole of its knapsack and gives its cell a\r\ncomplete coating of cement, after the manner of the Sacred Beetle and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe grub of the different species of Onthophagi does more artistic\r\nwork. Placing its putty drop by drop, it constructs a mosaic of\r\nlightly-projecting scales, suggesting those of a cedar-cone. When\r\nfinished, well dried and stripped of the last shreds of the original\r\nthimble, the shell thus obtained by the Bull Onthophagus is the size of\r\nan average filbert and resembles the pretty cone of the alder-tree. The\r\nimitation is so good that I was taken in by it the first time that I\r\nhandled the curious product when digging in my cages. It needed the\r\ncontents of the mock alder-cone to show me my mistake. The hump has an\r\nartfulness of its own: it was keeping this elegant specimen of\r\nstercoral jewellery in reserve for us.\r\n\r\nThe nymph of the Onthophagi provides us with another surprise. My\r\nobservations are confined to two species only: the Bull Onthophagus and\r\nthe Forked Onthophagus; but the difference between the two, in size and\r\nshape, is great enough to allow me to generalize and apply the\r\nfollowing singular fact to the whole genus.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the fore-edge of the corselet the nymph is armed\r\nwith a very distinct horn, projecting for about one-twelfth of an inch.\r\nThe horn is transparent, colourless and limp, as are all the budding\r\norgans at this period, particularly the legs, the cornicles of the\r\nforehead and the mouth-parts. This crystalline protuberance proclaims a\r\nfuture horn as clearly as the mandible is proclaimed by its initial\r\nnipple or the wing-case by its sheath. Any insect-collector will\r\nunderstand my amazement. A horn there, on the prothorax! But no\r\nOnthophagus wears such a weapon as that! The register of my\r\ninsect-house duly records the genus of the insect, but I dare not\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\nThe nymph moults. Together with the cast skin, the unfamiliar horn\r\ndries up and falls off, leaving not the least trace behind it. My two\r\nOnthophagi, recently disguised in strange armour, now have their\r\ncorselets bare.\r\n\r\nThis fleeting organ, which disappears without leaving even an\r\nexcrescence, this temporary horn at a spot destined in the end to be\r\nunmailed, gives rise to a few reflections. The Dung-beetles, those\r\nplacid creatures, generally favour a warlike harness: they love\r\noutlandish weapons, halberds, spears, grappling-irons, scimitars. Let\r\nus hurriedly recall the horn of the Spanish Copris. No Rhinoceros in\r\nthe Indian jungles boasts one to compare with it upon his nose. Broad\r\nat the base, pointed at the tip, curved like a bow, when the head is\r\nlifted the horn bends back till it touches the keel of the obliquely\r\ntruncated corselet. It might be a harpoon intended for ripping up some\r\nmonster. Remember also the Minotaur, [46] who looks as though he were\r\ngoing to spit his foe with his sheaf of three couched lances, and the\r\nLunary Copris, horned on the forehead, armed with a pike on each\r\nshoulder and wearing a corselet notched with little crescents that\r\nremind us of the short curved knife of the pork-butcher.\r\n\r\nThe Onthophagi have a most varied arsenal. One, O. taurus, wears the\r\nBull’s crescent-shaped horns; a second, O. vacca, prefers a wide, short\r\nblade, with its point sheathed in a notch in the corselet; a third, O.\r\nfurcatus, wields a trident; yet another, O. nuchicornis, owns a dagger\r\nwith a winged handle; and again O. cænobita sports a cavalryman’s\r\nsword. The worst-equipped crown their foreheads with a transversal\r\ncrest, with a pair of cornicles.\r\n\r\nWhat is the good of this panoply? Are we to look upon it as a set of\r\ntools, pickaxes, mattocks, pitchforks, spades, levers, which the insect\r\nmight ply in digging? By no means. The only industrial implements are\r\nthe forehead and the legs, especially the fore-legs. I have never\r\ndiscovered a Dung-beetle of any sort making use of her weapons either\r\nto excavate her burrow or to mix her provisions. Besides, as a rule,\r\nthe direction of the things alone would prevent their employment as\r\nutensils. For a digging-job performed forwards, what would you have a\r\nSpanish Copris do with her pickaxe, which points backwards? The\r\npowerful horn does not face the obstacle attacked; it turns its back\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThe Minotaur’s trident, though arranged in a suitable direction,\r\nlikewise remains unemployed. When deprived of this armour with a clip\r\nof my scissors, the Beetle loses none of his mining-talents; he goes\r\nunderground quite as easily as his unmutilated fellow. And here is an\r\neven more conclusive argument: the mothers, to whose lot the labour of\r\nnest-building falls; the mothers, those conspicuous workers, are\r\ndeprived of these horny growths or possess them only on a greatly\r\nreduced scale. They simplify the armour, or reject it entirely, because\r\nit is more of an impediment than an assistance to their work.\r\n\r\nAre we to look upon them as means of defence? Not that either. The\r\nruminants, the main feeders of the dung-eaters, are also given to\r\nwearing frontal armour. The analogy of taste is obvious, though it is\r\nimpossible for us to suspect its remote reasons. The Ram, the Bull, the\r\nGoat, the Chamois, the Stag, the Reindeer and the rest of them are\r\narmed with horns and antlers which they use in amorous jousts or for\r\nthe protection of the threatened herd. The Onthophagi know nothing of\r\nthese contests. There is no strife among them; and, should danger\r\narise, they content themselves with shamming death by gathering their\r\nlegs under their abdomen.\r\n\r\nTheir armour then is a mere ornament, the fine feathers of masculine\r\ncoquetry. According to life’s law of competition, the best-dressed\r\ncarry off the palm. Though we may regard those rapiers on the nose as\r\nqueer, their wearers are of another opinion; and the most eccentric\r\nenjoy the highest favour. The smallest extra pimple, springing up by\r\naccident, is an added beauty which may decide the choice among the\r\nsuitors. The best-adorned captivate the mothers, perpetuate the breed\r\nand hand down to their offspring the cornicle or the knob that caused\r\ntheir triumph. Thus by degrees was the ornamentation at which the\r\nentomologist wonders to-day formed and transmitted from generation to\r\ngeneration, improving as it went.\r\n\r\nTo this dictum of the evolutionists the nymph of the Onthophagus\r\nreplies as follows:\r\n\r\n‘I have on my back a budding horn, the germ of a bit of ornamentation\r\nthat can be very handsome, as witness the Bison Bubas, who turns it\r\ninto a splendid prow-shaped protuberance; witness also various exotic\r\nrelatives of mine, who lengthen their corselet into a magnificent spur.\r\nI possess the wherewithal to bring about a revolution among my kin. If\r\nI retained it, my bump, that charming innovation, would relegate my\r\nrivals to the second rank; I should be preferred above all others; I\r\nshould become the founder of a family; and my descendants, completing\r\nand improving on my first attempt, would behold the extinction of those\r\nantiquated old things. Why should the lump on my back wither\r\npurposeless? Why should my endeavour, repeated year after year for\r\ncenturies, never achieve the promised result?’\r\n\r\nListen to me, O ambitious one! The theorists, it is true, declare that\r\nevery casual acquisition, however trifling, is handed down and\r\nincreases if it be profitable; but don’t rely overmuch on that\r\nassertion. I do not doubt the advantages which you might gain from a\r\nlittle ornament. What I do very much doubt is the efficacity of time\r\nand environment as an evolutionary factor. You will be well-advised to\r\nbelieve that, born in the dim and distant past with a transient\r\ncallosity, you are continuing and will continue to be born with that\r\nrudimentary excrescence without any chance of fixing it, hardening it\r\ninto a horn or obtaining an additional decoration for your\r\nwedding-garment.\r\n\r\nBe we men or Dung-beetles, we are all created in the image of an\r\nunalterable prototype: the changing conditions of life alter us\r\nslightly on the surface but never in the framework of our being. The\r\nverdigris of the ages may encrust our medals, but it can give them\r\nneither a new image nor a new superscription. Nothing will give me the\r\nwings of a bird, desirable though these would be in the midst of our\r\nhuman squalor; nor will anything bestow upon your adult age the\r\ntriumphal crest which your nymphal knob seemed to prognosticate.\r\n\r\nThe nymphs of both the Onthophagus and the Oniticellus attain their\r\nmaturity in some twenty days. During August the adult form appears with\r\nthe half-white, half-red costume which has become familiar to us from\r\nour earlier studies. The normal colouring is fixed pretty quickly.\r\nNevertheless the insect is in no hurry to burst its shell: the\r\ndifficulty would be too great. It waits for the first showers of\r\nSeptember, which will come to its assistance by softening the casket.\r\nThe liberating rain arrives; and behold, issuing from the earth to rush\r\nafter food, the joyous small fry of the Onthophagi.\r\n\r\nAmong the domestic secrets which my cages reveal to me at this period,\r\none above all attracts my attention. I possess at the same time, in\r\nseparate establishments, the newcomers and the veterans, which last are\r\nas brisk and eager in their pursuit of the victuals as are their sons,\r\nnow banqueting for the first time in the open. The cages are stocked\r\nwith two generations.\r\n\r\nThe same synchronizing of fathers and sons is observable among all the\r\nDung-beetles that build their nests in the spring: Sacred Beetles,\r\nCopres and Geotrupes. The precaution which I have taken to watch the\r\nhatchings and to place the youngsters in a special compartment as and\r\nwhen they appeared confirms this remarkable simultaneity.\r\n\r\nIt is an entomological principle that the ancestor shall not see his\r\ndescendants; he dies once the future of his family is assured. By a\r\nglorious privilege, the Sacred Beetle and his rivals are allowed to\r\nknow their successors: fathers and sons meet at the same banquet, not\r\nin my cages, where the problems under consideration compel me to keep\r\nthem separate, but in the open fields. Together they gambol in the sun,\r\ntogether they exploit the patch of dung encountered; and this life of\r\nrevelry lasts as long as autumn continues to supply fine days.\r\n\r\nThe cold weather arrives. Sacred Beetles and Copres, Onthophagi and\r\nGymnopleuri dig themselves a burrow, go down into it with provisions,\r\nshut themselves in and wait. In January, on a frosty day, I dig into\r\nthe cages, which have no protection against the inclemencies of the\r\nseason. I go to work discreetly, so as not to submit all my captives to\r\nthe harsh test. Those whom I exhume each sit huddled in a shell, beside\r\nthe remaining provisions. All that the lethargy produced by the cold\r\nallows them to do is to move their legs and antennæ a little when I\r\nexpose them to the sun.\r\n\r\nHardly has the imprudent almond-tree burst into blossom in February,\r\nwhen some of the sleepers awake. Two of the earlier Onthophagi, O.\r\nlemur and O. fronticornis, are very common at this time, already\r\ncrumbling the dung warmed by the sun on the high-road. Soon the\r\nfestival of spring begins; and all, large and small, newcomers and\r\nveterans, hasten to take part in it. The old ones, not all, but at\r\nleast some of them, the best-preserved, fly off and get married a\r\nsecond time, an unparalleled privilege. They have two families,\r\nseparated by an interval of a year. They can indeed have three, as is\r\nevidenced by the Broad-necked Scarab, who, kept in a cage for three\r\nyears, gives me every year her collection of pears. Perhaps they even\r\ngo beyond this. The Dung-beetle tribe has its patriarchs who are truly\r\nvenerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE GEOTRUPES: THE PUBLIC HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nTo complete the cycle of the year in the adult form, to see one’s self\r\nsurrounded by one’s sons at the spring festival, to double and treble\r\none’s family: that surely is a most exceptional privilege in the insect\r\nworld. The Bees, the aristocracy of instinct, perish once the honey-pot\r\nis filled; the Butterflies, the aristocracy not of instinct but of\r\ndress, die when they have fastened their packet of eggs in a propitious\r\nspot; the richly-armoured Ground-beetles succumb when the germs of a\r\nposterity are scattered beneath the stones.\r\n\r\nSo with the others, except among the social insects, where the mother\r\nsurvives, either alone or accompanied by her attendants. It is a\r\ngeneral law: the insect is born orphaned of both its parents. And lo,\r\nby an unexpected turn of fate, the humble scavenger escapes the\r\ncatastrophes that devour the mighty! The Dung-beetle, sated with days,\r\nbecomes a patriarch.\r\n\r\nThis longevity explains first of all a fact that struck me long ago,\r\nwhen, to learn a little about the tribes whose history attracted me so\r\ngreatly, I used to stick rows of Beetles on pins in my boxes.\r\nGround-beetles, Rose-chafers, Buprestes, Capricorns, Saperdæ [47] and\r\nthe rest were collected one by one, after prolonged search. Now and\r\nagain a lucky find would make my cheeks glow with excitement.\r\nExclamations broke from our prentice band when one of these rarities\r\nwas captured. A touch of jealousy accompanied our congratulations of\r\nthe proud possessor. It was bound to be so; for think: there were not\r\nenough to go round.\r\n\r\nA Scalary Saperda, the denizen of dead cherry-trees, clad in deep\r\nyellow with ladder-like markings of black velvet; a purply\r\nGround-beetle, edged with amethyst along his ebony wing-cases; a\r\nbrilliant Buprestis, wedding the sheen of gold and copper to the\r\ngorgeous green of malachite: these were great events, far too\r\ninfrequent to satisfy us all.\r\n\r\nWith the Dung-beetles you can sing a different song! These are the ones\r\nif you want to fill the greediest of asphyxiating-phials to the neck.\r\nThey, especially the smaller ones, are a numberless multitude when the\r\nothers are few and far between. I remember Onthophagi and Aphodii\r\nswarming by the thousand under one shelter. You could have shovelled\r\nthem up if you wished.\r\n\r\nTo this day I am still astonished when I see these crowds again; as of\r\nold, the abundance of the Dung-beetle family forms a striking contrast\r\nwith the comparative scarcity of the others. If it occurred to me to go\r\na-hunting once more and renew the quest to which I owe moments of such\r\nsheer delight, I should be certain of filling my flasks with Scarabæi,\r\nCopres, Geotrupes, Onthophagi and other members of the same corporation\r\nbefore achieving any measure of success with the rest of the series. By\r\nthe time that May comes, the distiller of ordure is there in numbers;\r\nand in July and August, those months of blazing heat which see the\r\nsuspension of labour in the fields, the dealer in unsavoury matter is\r\nstill at work while the others have taken to earth and are lying in\r\nmotionless torpor. He and his contemporary, the Cicada, [48] represent\r\nalmost by themselves such activity as prevails during the torrid days.\r\n\r\nMay not this greater frequency of the Dung-beetles, at least in my part\r\nof the world, be due to the longevity of the adult form? I think so.\r\nWhereas the other insects are summoned to enjoy the fine weather only\r\nin successive generations, these receive a general invitation, father\r\nand sons together, daughters and mother together. Being equally\r\nprolific, they are therefore represented twice over.\r\n\r\nAnd they really deserve it, in consideration of the services which they\r\nrender. There is a general hygienic law which requires that every\r\nputrid thing shall disappear in the shortest possible time. Paris has\r\nnot yet solved the formidable problem of her sewage, which sooner or\r\nlater will become a question of life or death for the monstrous city.\r\nOne asks one’s self whether the centre of light is not doomed to be\r\nextinguished some day in the reeking exhalations of a soil saturated\r\nwith putrescence. What this agglomeration of millions of men cannot\r\nobtain, with all its treasures of wealth and talent, the smallest\r\nhamlet possesses without going to any expense or even troubling to\r\nthink about it.\r\n\r\nNature, so lavish of her cares in respect of rural health, is\r\nindifferent to the welfare of cities, if not actively hostile to it.\r\nShe has created for the fields two classes of scavengers, whom nothing\r\nwearies, whom nothing repels. One of these, consisting of Flies,\r\nSilphæ, Dermestes, Necrophori, Histers is charged with the dissection\r\nof corpses. They cut and hash, they elaborate the waste matter of death\r\nin their stomachs in order to restore it to life.\r\n\r\nA Mole ripped open by the ploughshare soils the path with its entrails,\r\nwhich soon turn purple; a Snake lies on the grass, crushed by the foot\r\nof a wayfarer who thought, the fool, that he was performing a good\r\nwork; an unfledged bird, fallen from its nest, lies, a crushed and\r\npathetic heap, at the foot of the tree that carried it; thousands of\r\nother similar remains, of every sort and kind, are scattered here and\r\nthere, threatening danger through their effluvia, if no steps be taken\r\nto put things right. Have no fear: no sooner is a corpse signalled in\r\nany direction than the little undertakers come trotting along. They\r\nwork away at it, empty it, consume it to the bone, or at least reduce\r\nit to the dryness of a mummy. In less than twenty-four hours, Mole,\r\nSnake, bird have disappeared and the requirements of health are\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nThe same zeal for their task exists in the second class of scavengers.\r\nThe village hardly knows those ammonia-scented refuges to which the\r\ntownsman repairs to relieve his sordid needs. A little bit of a wall, a\r\nhedge, a bush is all that the peasant asks as a retreat at the moment\r\nwhen he would fain be alone. I need say no more to suggest the\r\nencounters to which such free and easy manners expose you! Enticed by\r\nthe patches of lichen, the cushions of moss, the tufts of houseleek and\r\nother pretty things that adorn old stones, you go up to a sort of wall\r\nthat supports a vineyard. Faugh! At the foot of the daintily-decked\r\nshelter, what an unconcealed abomination! You flee: lichens, mosses and\r\nhouseleek tempt you no more. But come back on the morrow. The thing has\r\ndisappeared, the place is clean: the Dung-beetles have been that way.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the eyes from a frequent recurrence of offensive sights is,\r\nto these stalwart workers, the least of their tasks: a loftier mission\r\nis incumbent on them. Science tells us that the most dreadful scourges\r\nof mankind have their agents of dissemination in tiny organisms, the\r\nmicrobes, near neighbours of must and mould, on the extreme confines of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom. At times of epidemic, the terrible germs\r\nmultiply by countless myriads in the intestinal discharges. They\r\ncontaminate those main necessities of life, the air and the water; they\r\nspread over our linen, our clothes, our food and thus diffuse\r\ncontagion. We have to destroy by fire, to sterilize with corrosives or\r\nto bury underground such things as are infected with them.\r\n\r\nPrudence even demands that we should never allow ordure to linger on\r\nthe surface of the ground. It may be harmless or it may be dangerous:\r\nwhen in doubt, the best thing is to put it out of sight. That is how\r\nancient wisdom seems to have understood the thing, long before the\r\nmicrobe explained to us the need for vigilance. The nations of the\r\neast, more liable than we to epidemics, had formal laws in these\r\nmatters. Moses, apparently echoing Egyptian knowledge in this case,\r\ntabulated the rules of conduct for his people wandering in the Arabian\r\ndesert:\r\n\r\n\r\n   ‘Thou shalt have a place without the camp,’ he says, ‘to which thou\r\n    mayst go for the necessities of nature, carrying a paddle at thy\r\n    girdle. And, when thou sittest down, thou shalt dig round about and\r\n    with the earth that is dug up thou shalt cover that which thou art\r\n    eased of’ (Deut. xxiii. 12–14).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simple precept touches a matter of grave concern; and we may well\r\nbelieve that, if Islam, at the time of its great pilgrimages to the\r\nKaaba, were to take the same precaution and a few more of a similar\r\ncharacter, Mecca would cease to be an annual seat of cholera and Europe\r\nwould not need to mount guard on the shores of the Red Sea to protect\r\nherself against the scourge.\r\n\r\nHeedless of hygiene as the Arab, who was one of his ancestors, the\r\nProvençal peasant does not suspect the danger. Fortunately, the\r\nDung-beetle, that faithful observer of the Mosaic law, is at work. It\r\nis his to remove from sight, it is his to bury the microbe-laden\r\nmatter. Supplied with digging-implements far superior to the paddle\r\nwhich the Israelite was to carry at his girdle when urgent business\r\ncalled him from the camp, he hastens to the spot and, as soon as man is\r\ngone, excavates a pit wherein the infection is swallowed up and\r\nrendered harmless.\r\n\r\nThe services rendered by these sextons are of the highest importance to\r\nthe health of the fields; yet we, who are those most interested in this\r\nconstant work of purification, hardly vouchsafe the sturdy toilers a\r\ncontemptuous glance. Popular language overwhelms them with harsh\r\nepithets. This appears to be the rule: do good and you shall be\r\nmisjudged, you shall be traduced, stoned, trodden underfoot, as witness\r\nthe Toad, the Bat, the Hedgehog, the Owl and other helpers who, for\r\ntheir services, ask nothing but a little tolerance.\r\n\r\nNow, of our defenders against the dangers of filth flaunted shamelessly\r\nin the rays of the sun, the most remarkable in our climes are the\r\nGeotrupes: not that they are more zealous than the others, but because\r\ntheir size makes them capable of heavier work. Moreover, when it is\r\nsimply a question of their nourishment, they resort by preference to\r\nthe materials which we have most to fear.\r\n\r\nMy neighbourhood is worked by four species of Geotrupes. Two of them,\r\nG. mutator, Marsh, and G. sylvaticus, Panz., are rarities on which we\r\nhad best not count for connected studies; the two others, on the\r\ncontrary, G. stercorarius, Lin., and G. hypocrita, Schneid., are\r\nexceedingly common. Black as ink above, both of them are magnificently\r\ngarbed below. We are quite surprised to find such a jewel-case among\r\nthe professional scavengers. The under surface of the Stercoraceous\r\nGeotrupes is of a splendid amethyst-violet, while that of the Mimic\r\nGeotrupes makes a generous display of the ruddy gleams of copper\r\npyrites. These two species are the inmates of my insect-houses.\r\n\r\nLet us ask them first of what feats they are capable as buriers. There\r\nare a dozen of them in all. The cage is previously swept clean of what\r\nremains of the former provisions, hitherto supplied without stint. This\r\ntime, I propose to find out what a Geotrupes can stow away in one\r\nnight. At sunset, I serve to my twelve captives the whole of a heap\r\nwhich a Mule has just dropped in front of my door. There is plenty of\r\nit, enough to fill a basket.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the next day, the mass has disappeared underground.\r\nThere is nothing left outside, or very nearly nothing. I am able to\r\nmake a fairly close estimate and I find that each of my Geotrupes,\r\npresuming each of the twelve to have done an equal share of the work,\r\nhas buried pretty nearly sixty cubic inches of matter: a Titanic task,\r\nwhen we remember the insignificant size of the insect, which, moreover,\r\nhas to dig the warehouse to which the booty must be lowered. And all\r\nthis is done in the space of a night.\r\n\r\nHaving feathered their nests so well, will they remain quietly\r\nunderground with their treasure? Not they! The weather is magnificent.\r\nThe hour of twilight comes, gentle and calm. Now is the time when long\r\nflights are undertaken, when joyous humming fills the air, when the\r\ninsects go afar, searching the roads by which the herds have lately\r\npassed. My lodgers abandon their cellars and mount to the surface. I\r\nhear them buzzing, climbing up the wirework, bumping wildly against the\r\nwalls. I have anticipated this twilight animation. Provisions have been\r\ncollected during the day, plentiful as those of yesterday. I serve\r\nthem. There is the same disappearance during the night. On the morrow,\r\nthe place is once again swept clean. And this would continue\r\nindefinitely, so fine are the evenings, if I always had at my disposal\r\nthe wherewithal to satisfy these insatiable hoarders.\r\n\r\nRich though his booty be, the Geotrupes leaves it at sunset to dally in\r\nthe last gleams of daylight and to go in search of a new workplace.\r\nWith him, one would say, the wealth acquired does not count; the only\r\nthing of value is that to be acquired. Then what does he do with his\r\nwarehouses, renewed each twilight in favourable weather? It is obvious\r\nthat the Dung-beetle is incapable of consuming all those provisions in\r\na single night. He has such a superabundance of victuals in his larder\r\nthat he does not know how to dispose of them; he is surfeited with good\r\nthings by which he will not profit; and, not satisfied with having his\r\nstore crammed, the acquisitive plutocrat slaves, night after night, to\r\nstore away more.\r\n\r\nFrom each warehouse, set up here, set up there, as things happen, he\r\ndeducts the daily meal beforehand; the rest, which means almost the\r\nwhole, he abandons. My cages testify to the fact that this instinct for\r\nburying is more imperative than the consumer’s appetite. The ground is\r\nsoon raised, in consequence; and I am obliged, from time to time, to\r\nlower the level to the desired limits. If I dig it up, I find it choked\r\nthroughout its depth with hoards that have remained intact. The\r\noriginal earth has become a hopeless conglomeration, which I must prune\r\nfreely, if I would not go astray in my future observations.\r\n\r\nAllowing for errors, either of excess or deficiency, which are\r\ninevitable in a subject that does not admit of exact measurement, one\r\npoint stands out very clearly as the result of my enquiry: the\r\nGeotrupes are enthusiastic buriers; they take underground a great deal\r\nmore than is necessary for their consumption. As this work is\r\nperformed, in varying degrees, by legions of collaborators, large and\r\nsmall, it is evident that the purification of the soil must benefit to\r\na considerable extent and that the public health is to be congratulated\r\non having this army of auxiliaries in its service.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the plant and, indirectly, a host of different existences\r\nare interested in these interments. What the Geotrupes buries and\r\nabandons the next day is not lost: far from it. Nothing is lost in the\r\nworld’s balance-sheet; at stock-taking, the total never varies. The\r\nlittle lump of dung buried by the insect will make the nearest tuft of\r\ngrass grow a luxuriant green. A Sheep passes, crops the bunch of grass:\r\nall the better for the leg of mutton which man is waiting for; the\r\nDung-beetle’s industry has procured us a savoury mouthful.\r\n\r\nEven that is something, though we are making our usual mistake of\r\ncomparing everything with our own standard. How much more it becomes,\r\nonce we begin to think and get away from this narrow point of view! To\r\nenumerate all those who benefit, directly or indirectly, by the\r\nDung-beetle’s work would be impossible, so inextricably interlinked is\r\nall that exists. I think of the Warbler, who will stuff the mattress of\r\nhis nest with the tiny stalks retted by the rain and sun; the\r\ncaterpillar of some Psyche, which will construct its Moth-case by\r\nimbricating the remnants of those same stalks; little Cockchafers, who\r\nwill nibble the anthers of the tall grasses; tiny Weevils, who will\r\nturn the ripe seeds into cradles for their grubs; tribes of Aphides,\r\nwho will settle under the leaves; and Ants, who will come and slake\r\ntheir thirst at the sugary cornicles of the last-named herd.\r\n\r\nLet us be content with this list, or we shall never have done. A whole\r\nworld is benefited by the agricultural industry of the Dung-beetle,\r\nthat burier of manure: first the plant and then all that live upon the\r\nplant. A small world, a very small world, as small as you please, but\r\nafter all not a negligible world. It is of such trifles that the great\r\nintegral of life is composed, even as the integral of the\r\nmathematicians is composed of quantities neighbouring on 0.\r\n\r\nAgricultural chemistry teaches us that, to employ the stable-dung to\r\nthe best purpose, we should put it into the ground, so far as possible,\r\nwhile fresh. When diluted by the rain and dissipated by the air, it\r\nbecomes lifeless and devoid of fertilizing elements. This highly\r\nimportant agronomic truth is quite familiar to the Geotrupes and his\r\ncolleagues. In their burying-work they invariably aim at materials of\r\nrecent date. Just as they are eager to put away the produce of the\r\nmoment, all saturated with its potassium, its nitrates and its\r\nphosphates, even so do they scorn the stuff hardened into brick by the\r\nsun or rendered infertile by long exposure to the air. The valueless\r\nresidue does not interest them; they leave this barren rubbish to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWe now know about the Geotrupes as a sanitary expert and a collector of\r\nmanure. We are going to see him in a third aspect, that of the\r\nsagacious weather-prophet. It is popularly believed, in the\r\ncountry-side, that a swarm of agitated Geotrupes, skimming the ground\r\nwith an air of great business in the evening, is a sign of fine weather\r\non the morrow. Is this rustic prognostication worth anything? My cages\r\nshall tell us. I watch my boarders closely all through the autumn, the\r\nperiod when they build their nests; I note the state of the sky on the\r\nday before and register the weather of the next day. I use no\r\nthermometer, no barometer, none of the scientific implements employed\r\nin the meteorological observatories. I confine myself to the summary\r\ninformation derived from my personal impressions.\r\n\r\nThe Geotrupes do not leave their burrows until after sundown. With the\r\nlast glimmer of daylight, if the air be calm and the temperature mild,\r\nthey roam about, flying low with a humming noise, seeking the materials\r\nwhich have accumulated for them in the course of the day. If they come\r\nupon something that suits them, they drop down heavily, tumbling over\r\nin their clumsy eagerness, thrust themselves into their new treasure\r\nand spend the best part of the night in burying it. In this way the\r\ndirt of the fields is made to disappear in a single night.\r\n\r\nThere is one condition indispensable to this purging-process: the\r\natmosphere must be still and warm. Should it rain, the Geotrupes will\r\nnot stir out of doors. They have sufficient resources underground for a\r\nprolonged holiday. Should it be cold, should the north-wind blow, they\r\nwill not sally forth either. In both cases my cages remain deserted on\r\nthe surface. We will leave out of the question these periods of\r\nenforced leisure and consider only those evenings on which the\r\natmospheric conditions are favourable to foraging-expeditions, or at\r\nleast seem to me as though they ought to be. I will summarize the\r\ndetails in my note-book in three general cases.\r\n\r\nFirst case. A glorious evening. The Geotrupes fuss about the cages,\r\nimpatient to hasten to their nocturnal task. Next day, magnificent\r\nweather. The prophecy, of course, is of the simplest. To-day’s fine\r\nweather is only the continuation of yesterday’s. If the Geotrupes know\r\nnothing more than this, they hardly deserve their reputation. However,\r\nlet us pursue the experiment before drawing any conclusions.\r\n\r\nSecond case. Again a fine evening. My experience seems to say that the\r\ncondition of the sky forebodes a fine morning. The Geotrupes think\r\notherwise. They do not come out. Which of the two will be right, man or\r\nDung-beetle? The Dung-beetle: thanks to the keenness of his\r\nperceptions, he foresees, he scents a downpour. Rain comes during the\r\nnight and lasts for part of the day.\r\n\r\nThird case. The sky is overcast. Will the south-wind, gathering its\r\nclouds, bring us rain? I am of that opinion, appearances seem so much\r\nto point that way. The Geotrupes, however, fly and buzz around their\r\ncages. Their prophecy is correct and I am wrong. The threat of rain is\r\ndispelled and the sun next morning rises radiantly.\r\n\r\nThey seem to be influenced above all by the electric tension of the\r\natmosphere. On hot and sultry evenings, when a storm is brewing, I see\r\nthem moving about even more than usual. The morrow is always marked by\r\nviolent claps of thunder.\r\n\r\nThere you have the upshot of my observations, which were continued for\r\nthree months. Whatever the condition of the sky, whether clear or\r\nclouded, the Geotrupes announce fair weather or storm by their excited\r\nmovements in the evening twilight. They are living barometers, more\r\nworthy of belief perhaps, in such contingencies, than the barometer of\r\nour scientists. The exquisite sensitiveness of life is mightier than\r\nthe brute weight of a column of mercury.\r\n\r\nI will end by mentioning a fact that well deserves further\r\ninvestigation when circumstances permit. On the twelfth, thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth of November 1894, the Geotrupes in my cages are in an\r\nextraordinarily agitated condition. Never before and never since have I\r\nseen such animation. They clamber wildly up the wires; at every moment\r\nthey take wing and at once bump against the walls and are flung to the\r\nground. Their restlessness continues until a late hour of the night, a\r\nvery unusual thing with them. Out of doors, a few free neighbours run\r\nup and complete the riot in front of my house. What can be happening to\r\nbring these strangers here and especially to throw my cages into such a\r\nstate of excitement?\r\n\r\nAfter a few hot days, which are most exceptional at this time of the\r\nyear, the south-wind prevails, foretelling that rain is at hand. On the\r\nevening of the fourteenth, an endless procession of broken clouds\r\npasses before the face of the moon. It is a magnificent sight. During\r\nthe night the wind drops. There is not a breath of air. The sky is a\r\nuniform grey. The rain pours straight down, monotonously, continuously,\r\ndepressingly. It looks as though it would never stop. And it goes on,\r\nin fact, until the eighteenth of the month.\r\n\r\nDid the Geotrupes, who were so restless on the twelfth, foresee this\r\ndeluge? They did. But as a rule they do not quit their burrows at the\r\napproach of rain. Something very extraordinary must have happened,\r\ntherefore, to upset them in this way.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers explained the riddle. On the twelfth a storm of\r\nunprecedented violence burst over the north of France. The great\r\nbarometrical depression which caused it was echoed in my district; and\r\nthe Geotrupes marked this profound disturbance by their exceptional\r\ndisplay of emotion. They told me of the hurricane before the papers\r\ndid, had I but been able to understand them. Was this simply a chance\r\ncoincidence, or was it a case of cause and effect? In the absence of\r\nsufficient evidence, I will end on this note of interrogation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE GEOTRUPES: NEST-BUILDING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September and October, when the first autumn rains soak the ground\r\nand allow the Sacred Beetle to split his natal casket, the\r\nStercoraceous Geotrupes and the Mimic Geotrupes found their\r\nfamily-establishments: somewhat makeshift establishments, in spite of\r\nwhat we might have expected from the name of these miners, so well\r\nstyled earth-borers. When he has to dig himself a retreat that shall\r\nshelter him against the rigours of winter, the Geotrupes really\r\ndeserves his name: none can compare with him for the depth of the pit\r\nor the perfection and rapidity of the work. In sandy ground, easily\r\nexcavated, I have dug up some that were buried over a yard deep. Others\r\ncarried their digging farther still, tiring both my patience and my\r\nimplements. There you have the skilled well-sinker, the inimitable\r\nearth-borer. When the cold sets in, he will be able to descend to some\r\nstratum where the frost has lost its terrors.\r\n\r\nThe family-lodging is another matter. The propitious season is a short\r\none; time would fail, if each individual grub had to be endowed with\r\none of those mansions. Nothing could be more satisfactory than for the\r\ninsect to devote the leisure which the approach of winter gives it to\r\ndigging a hole of unlimited depth: this makes the retreat doubly safe;\r\nand for the moment its energies, which are not yet suspended, have no\r\nother outlet. But at laying-time these laborious undertakings are\r\nimpossible. The hours pass swiftly. In four or five weeks a numerous\r\nfamily has to be housed and victualled, which puts the sinking of a\r\ndeep pit that requires time and patience quite out of the question.\r\n\r\nIn any case, precautions will be taken against the dangers of the\r\nsurface. Once its family is settled, the unprotected adult insect is\r\nobliged to establish its winter quarters at great depths, whence it\r\nwill emerge in spring accompanied by its young ones, like the Sacred\r\nBeetle; but neither the egg nor the grub needs this costly refuge in\r\nthe wet season, being well protected by the parents’ industry.\r\n\r\nThe burrow dug by the Geotrupes for the benefit of her grub is hardly\r\ndeeper than that of the Copris or the Sacred Beetle, notwithstanding\r\nthe difference of the seasons. Eleven or twelve inches, roughly\r\nspeaking, is the most that I find in the fields, where nothing occurs\r\nto restrict the depth. My cages, with their limited thickness of soil,\r\nare less trustworthy in this respect, since the insect has no option\r\nbut to use the layer of earth at its disposal. Many a time, however, I\r\nperceive that this layer is not fully traversed down to the floor of\r\nthe box, thus furnishing a fresh proof of the slight depth needed.\r\n\r\nIn the open fields as in the confinement of my cages, the burrow is\r\nalways dug under the heap of dung that is being exploited. No outward\r\nsign betrays its presence, concealed as it is beneath the voluminous\r\ndroppings of the Mule. It is a cylindrical passage, the same width as\r\nthe neck of a claret-bottle, straight and perpendicular in a\r\nhomogeneous soil, bent and winding irregularly in rough ground where a\r\nroot or stone may bar the way and necessitate an abrupt change of\r\ndirection. In my cages, when the layer of earth is insufficient, the\r\npit, at first vertical, bends at right angles on touching the wooden\r\nfloor and is continued horizontally. There is no precise rule therefore\r\nin the boring. The accidents of the soil determine the shape.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the gallery again there is nothing to remind us of the\r\nspacious hall, the workshop where Copres, Scarabæi and Gymnopleuri\r\nfashion their artistic pears and ovoids, but a mere cul-de-sac of the\r\nsame diameter as the nest. A veritable drill-hole, if we make\r\nallowances for the occasional knots and twists inevitable in boring\r\nthrough stuff that offers more resistance at some places than at\r\nothers; a winding channel: that is what the Geotrupes’ burrow is.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the crude dwelling take the form of a sort of sausage\r\nor pudding, which fills the lower part of the cylinder and fits it\r\nexactly. Its length is not far short of eight inches and its width\r\nabout an inch and a half, when the thing belongs to the Stercoraceous\r\nGeotrupes. The dimensions are a little smaller in the work of the Mimic\r\nGeotrupes. In either case, the sausage is nearly always irregular in\r\nshape, now curved, now more or less dented. These imperfections of the\r\nsurface are due to the accidents of a stony ground, which the insect\r\ndoes not always excavate according to the canons of its art, which\r\nfavours the straight line and the perpendicular. The moulded material\r\nfaithfully reproduces all the irregularities of its mould. The lower\r\nend is rounded off like the bottom of the burrow itself; the upper end\r\nis slightly concave, through being packed more closely in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe voluminous object is put together in layers rather suggestive, as\r\nregards curve and arrangement, of a pile of watch-glasses. Each of them\r\nobviously corresponds with a load of materials gathered in the heap\r\nabove the burrow, carried down separately, placed in position on the\r\nprevious layer and then vigorously trampled flat. The edges of the\r\ndisk, which adapt themselves less well to this work of compression,\r\nremain at a higher level; and all this tends to form something like a\r\nconcave lens. These same less-compressed edges give a sort of rind,\r\nwhich is soiled with earth owing to its contact with the walls of the\r\ntunnel. Altogether, the structure tells us the method of manufacture.\r\nThe Geotrupes’ sausage, like our own, is obtained by moulding in a\r\ncylinder. It results from layers introduced one after the other and\r\nduly compressed, especially in the middle, which is more easily\r\naccessible to the manipulator’s legs. Direct observation will presently\r\nconfirm these inferences and supplement them with details of\r\nconsiderable interest, which we should never suspect from simply\r\nexamining the work.\r\n\r\nBefore continuing, let us note how well inspired the insect is in\r\nalways boring its burrow under the heap whence the materials for the\r\nsausage are to be extracted. The number of loads successively carried\r\ndown and pressed is considerable. Allowing a thickness of a sixth of an\r\ninch for each layer—a figure which is near enough—I see that some fifty\r\njourneys are needed. If the provisions had each time to be fetched from\r\na distance, the Geotrupes would be unable to cope with her task, which\r\nwould be too long and tiring. Her sort of work is incompatible with all\r\nthat travelling, after the fashion of the Sacred Beetle’s. She is wise\r\nto settle beneath the heap. She has only to climb up from her well to\r\nfind under her feet, at her very door, enough to make her\r\nblack-pudding, however large she may wish it to be.\r\n\r\nThis, it is true, presupposes a copiously supplied workyard. When\r\ntoiling on behalf of her grub, the Geotrupes keeps a look-out for one\r\nof this kind and accepts no purveyors except the Horse and the Mule,\r\nnever the Sheep, who is too niggardly. It is not a question here of the\r\nquality of the foodstuffs; it is a question of quantity. My cages, in\r\nfact, tell me that the Sheep would have the preference, if she were\r\nmore generous. What she does not give normally I create artificially by\r\npiling sheaf upon sheaf. Beneath this extraordinary treasure, the like\r\nof which is never offered by the fields, my captives work with a zest\r\nthat shows how well they appreciate the windfall. They enrich me with\r\nmore sausages than I know what to do with. I arrange them in strata in\r\ngreat pots, so that, when winter comes, I may study the actions of the\r\nlarva; I lodge them separately in glass tubes and test-tubes; I pack\r\nthem in tins. The shelves of my study are crammed with them. My\r\ncollection reminds me of an assortment of potted meats.\r\n\r\nThe unfamiliarity of the material involves no change in the structure.\r\nBecause of its finer grain and greater plasticity, the surface is more\r\nregular and the inside more homogeneous; and that is all.\r\n\r\nAt the lower end of the sausage, which end is always rounded off, is\r\nthe hatching-chamber, a circular cavity which could hold a fair-sized\r\nhazel-nut. The respiratory needs of the germ demand that the side-walls\r\nshould be thin enough to allow the air to enter freely. Inside, I catch\r\nthe gleam of a greenish, semifluid plaster, a simple exudation from the\r\nporous mass, as in the Copris’ ovoids and the Sacred Beetle’s pears.\r\n\r\nIn this round hollow lies the egg, without adhering in any way to the\r\nsurrounding walls. It is a white, elongated ellipsoid and is of\r\nremarkable bulk in proportion to the insect. In the case of the\r\nStercoraceous Geotrupes, it measures seven to eight millimetres in\r\nlength by four at its widest point. [49] The egg of the Mimic Geotrupes\r\nis a little smaller.\r\n\r\nThis little hollow contrived in the substance of the sausage, at the\r\nlower end, does not agree at all with what I have read about the\r\nGeotrupes’ nest-building. Quoting an old German writer, Frisch, [50] an\r\nauthor whom the poverty of my library does not allow me to consult,\r\nMulsant, [51] speaking of the Stercoraceous Geotrupes, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n   ‘At the bottom of her perpendicular gallery, the mother builds,\r\n    usually with earth, a sort of nest, or egg-shaped shell, open at\r\n    one side. On the inner wall of this shell she glues a whitish egg,\r\n    the size of a grain of wheat.’\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can this shell be, usually made of earth and open at one side so\r\nthat the grub may reach the column of provisions overhead? I am at an\r\nutter loss to know. Shell, especially made of earth, there is none, nor\r\nany opening. I see and see again, as often as I wish, a round cell,\r\nclosed everywhere and built at the lower end of the food-cylinder, but\r\nnothing else, nothing that even vaguely resembles the structure\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nWhich of the two is responsible for the imaginary construction? Can the\r\nGerman entomologist have sinned through superficial observation? Or did\r\nthe Lyons entomologist misinterpret the older author? I lack the\r\nnecessary documents to bring the mistake home to the right person. Is\r\nit not pathetic to see these masters, who are so punctilious about a\r\njoint of the palpi, so cantankerous about the first claim to some\r\nbarbaric appellation, almost indifferent when they come to treat of\r\nhabits and industry, which are the supreme expression of an insect’s\r\nlife? Nomenclators’ entomology is making enormous strides: it\r\noverwhelms us, swamps us. The other, biologists’ entomology, the only\r\ninteresting branch of the science, the only one really worthy of our\r\nattention, is neglected to such an extent that the commonest species\r\nhas no history or calls for serious revision of the little that has\r\nbeen written about it. Vain lamentations: things will go on in the same\r\nold way for a long time to come.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Geotrupes’ sausage. Its shape is diametrically\r\nopposite to that which we have studied in the case of the Copris and\r\nthe Sacred Beetle, who are sparing of material but very generous with\r\ntheir labour, taking great care to give their work the shape best\r\nsuited to preserve it against dryness. With their ovoids and their\r\nspheres surmounted by a neck, they are able to keep the modest\r\nfamily-ration fresh. The Geotrupes knows nothing of these scientific\r\nmethods. More primitive in her ways, she sees well-being only in\r\noverabundance. Provided that the gallery be crammed with food, she\r\nlittle cares how shapeless her pile may be.\r\n\r\nInstead of avoiding dryness, she appears to go in search of it. Just\r\nlook at the sausage. It is inordinately long and clumsily put together.\r\nThere is no compact, impermeable rind; and there is an excessive amount\r\nof surface, touching the earth for the whole length of the cylinder.\r\nThis is exactly what is needed to bring about quick desiccation; it is\r\nthe converse of the problem of the smallest surface, solved by the\r\nSacred Beetle and the others. Then what becomes of my views on the\r\nshape of those provisions, views so well founded, according to our\r\nlogic? Can I have been taken in by a blind geometry, which achieves a\r\nrational result by chance?\r\n\r\nTo any one who says so let the facts reply. Here is their answer: the\r\nmanufacturers of spheres build their nests at the height of the summer,\r\nwhen the ground is parched; the manufacturers of cylinders build theirs\r\nin the autumn, when the earth becomes saturated with rain. The first\r\nhave to guard their family against the danger of bread too hard to eat.\r\nThe second know nothing of starvation through desiccation; their\r\nprovisions, potted in cool earth, retain indefinitely the proper degree\r\nof softness. The moistness, not the shape, of the sheath is the\r\nsafeguard of the ration inside it. The rainfall at this time of the\r\nyear is in inverse ratio to that of summer; and this is enough to\r\nrender useless the precautions taken in the dog-days.\r\n\r\nLet us probe deeper and we shall see that the cylinder is preferable to\r\nthe sphere in autumn. When October and November come, the rains are\r\nfrequent and persistent; but a day’s sunshine is enough to dry the soil\r\nto the shallow depth where the Geotrupes’ nest lies. It is a serious\r\nmatter not to lose the enjoyment of this fine day. How will the grub\r\nbenefit by it?\r\n\r\nImagine the larva enclosed in the big ball which the copious quantity\r\nof food placed at its disposal might well supply. Once saturated with\r\nmoisture by a shower, this sphere would retain it stubbornly, for its\r\nform is that of least evaporation and of least contact with the\r\nsun-warmed soil. In vain, within twenty-four hours, will the surface\r\nlayer of the ground be restored to its normal coolness: the globular\r\nmass will retain its excess of water, for lack of adequate contact with\r\nthe sun- and air-dried earth. In the too-humid and too-thick recess,\r\nthe provisions will go musty; the heat from outside will be\r\ninopportune, as will the air; and the larva will derive little\r\nadvantage from this late autumn sun, whose tardy rays ought to ripen it\r\nto perfection and give it the necessary vigour to brave the trials of\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nWhat was a good quality in July, when it was necessary to guard against\r\nexcessive dryness, becomes a bad one in October, when excessive damp is\r\nto be avoided. The cylinder is therefore substituted for the sphere.\r\nThe new shape, with its exaggerated length, fulfils the converse\r\ncondition of that beloved by the pill-makers: here, with a similar\r\nvolume, the surface is developed to its extreme limits. Is there a\r\nreason for this complete change? No doubt; and I seem to perceive it.\r\nNow that dryness is no longer to be feared, will not this kind of\r\nshape, with its large surface, enable the mass of foodstuff to get rid\r\nof its superfluous moisture more readily? Should it rain, its wide area\r\ncertainly will make it liable to more rapid saturation; but also, when\r\nthe fine weather returns, the surplus water will soon disappear thanks\r\nto the extensive contact with a quickly-drained soil.\r\n\r\nLet us conclude by enquiring how the roly-poly is manufactured. To\r\nwatch the performance in the fields appears to me a very difficult, not\r\nto say impracticable undertaking. With my cages, success is certain,\r\nprovided that we exercise a little patience and dexterity. I let down\r\nthe board which keeps the artificial soil in place at the back. This\r\nnow reveals its vertical surface, which I explore bit by bit with the\r\npoint of a knife until I strike a burrow. If the operation be\r\ncautiously conducted, without the disturbance due to an ill-calculated\r\nlandslip, the labourers are discovered at their toil, paralysed, it is\r\ntrue, by the sudden flood of light and as it were petrified in the\r\nattitude of work. The arrangement of the workshop and the materials,\r\nthe position and posture of the workers enable us easily to reconstruct\r\nthe scene, though it be abruptly suspended and not renewed so long as\r\nour inspection lasts.\r\n\r\nOne fact, to begin with, thrusts itself upon our attention, a fact of\r\ndeep interest and so exceptional that this is the first example with\r\nwhich my entomological studies have presented me. In each burrow laid\r\nbare I always find two collaborators, a pair: I find the male lending\r\nthe mother his assistance. The household duties are divided between the\r\ntwo. My notes give the following scene, to which we can easily restore\r\nits animation according to the pose of the immobilized actors.\r\n\r\nThe male is at the back of the gallery, squatting on a length of\r\nsausage measuring barely an inch. He occupies the basin formed through\r\nthe stuff’s being packed more tightly in the centre of each stratum.\r\nWhat was he doing before the violation of his home? His attitude tells\r\nus clearly: with his sturdy legs, especially the hind-legs, he was\r\npressing down the last layer placed in position. His mate occupies the\r\nupper floor, almost at the opening of the burrow. I see her holding\r\nbetween her legs a great lump of material which she has just gathered\r\nat the bottom of the heap surmounting the house. The scare caused by my\r\nintrusion has not made her let go. Hanging up there, above space,\r\nbraced against the walls of the pit, she clasps her burden with a sort\r\nof cataleptic obstinacy. The nature of the interrupted work is easily\r\nguessed: Baucis was carrying down to Philemon, the stronger of the two,\r\nthe wherewithal to continue the arduous work of piling and trampling.\r\nAfter laying the egg and surrounding it with those delicate precautions\r\nof which a mother alone possesses the secret, she had handed over the\r\nconstruction of the cylinder to her companion, confining herself to\r\nplaying the humble part of a caterer’s man.\r\n\r\nSimilar scenes, observed during different phases of the work, enable me\r\nto draw a general picture. The sausage begins with a short, wide casing\r\nwhich closely lines the bottom of the burrow. In this bag, with its\r\nyawning mouth, I find the two sexes in the midst of materials crumbled\r\nand possibly weeded before being pressed, so that the grub may have\r\nfirst-class victuals within its reach as soon as it starts feeding. The\r\ncouple between them plaster the walls and increase their thickness\r\nuntil the cavity is reduced to the size needed for the\r\nhatching-chamber.\r\n\r\nThis is the moment for laying the egg. Withdrawing discreetly, the male\r\nwaits with materials ready to close the cell that has just been filled.\r\nThe closing is done by bringing the edges of the sack nearer together\r\nand adding a ceiling, a hermetically cemented lid. This is the delicate\r\npart of the work, calling for knack much more than strength. The mother\r\nalone attends to it. Philemon is now a mere journeyman-mason: he passes\r\nthe mortar, without being allowed on the ceiling, which his brutal\r\npressure might cause to fall in.\r\n\r\nSoon the roof, duly thickened and reinforced, has nothing more to fear\r\nfrom pressure. Then the ruthless stamping begins, the rough work which\r\ntransfers the leading part to the male. In the Stercoraceous Geotrupes\r\nthe difference in size and vigour between the sexes is striking. Here\r\nindeed we have a very exceptional case: Philemon belongs to the\r\nstronger sex. He is distinguished by his portly figure and muscular\r\nenergy. Take him in your hand and squeeze. I defy you to stand it, if\r\nyour skin is at all sensitive to pain. With his sharp-toothed and\r\nconvulsively stiffened legs, he digs into your flesh; he slips like an\r\nirresistible wedge into the spaces between your fingers. It is more\r\nthan you can bear; and you have to let the creature go.\r\n\r\nIn the household he performs the function of an hydraulic press. We\r\nsubject our packs of fodder to the action of the press in order to\r\nreduce their cumbrous bulk; he likewise compresses and reduces the\r\nstringy materials of his sausage. It is most often the male that I find\r\nat the top of the cylinder, a top excavated to form a deep basket. This\r\nbasket receives the load brought down by the mother; and, like the\r\nlabourer trampling on the grapes at the bottom of the vintage-tub, the\r\nGeotrupes presses and amalgamates his materials with the convulsive\r\neffort of his galvanic movements. The operation is so well conducted\r\nthat the new load, at first not unlike a voluminous mass of coarse\r\nlint, becomes a compact layer uniform with the one before it.\r\n\r\nThe mother, however, does not abdicate her rights: I find her now and\r\nthen at the bottom of the basin. Perhaps she has come to see how the\r\nwork is going on. Her touch, which is better-suited for the delicate\r\npart of the rearing, will more readily discover the mistakes that need\r\ncorrecting. Very likely also she comes to relieve her husband in these\r\nexhausting compressive operations. She herself is strong, sturdy in the\r\nlegs and capable of working turn and turn about with her valiant\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nHowever, her usual place is at the top of the gallery. I find her there\r\nat one time with the armful which she has just gathered, at another\r\nwith a heap made up of several loads placed in reserve for the work\r\ndown below. As and when it is wanted, she draws upon the heap and\r\ngradually carries the materials down to be pressed by the male.\r\n\r\nBetween this temporary warehouse and the basin at the bottom there is a\r\nlong empty space, the lower part of which supplies us with another bit\r\nof information as to the progress of the work. The walls are lavishly\r\ncoated with a wash extracted from the most plastic portion of the\r\nmaterials. This detail is not without value. It tells us that, before\r\npacking the food-sausage layer by layer, the insect begins by cementing\r\nthe rough and porous wall of the mould. It putties its well to protect\r\nthe grub against the damp which might ooze through in the rainy season.\r\nFinding it impossible by pressure to harden the skin of the\r\ntightly-packed sausage to the requisite degree, it adopts a means\r\nunknown to the Beetles that labour in large workshops; it coats the\r\nearthy casing with cement. In this way it avoids, so far as lies in its\r\npower, the risk of drowning on rainy days.\r\n\r\nThis waterproofing is done at intervals, as the cylinder grows in\r\nlength. The mother appears to me to attend to it whenever her warehouse\r\nof provisions is sufficiently stocked to give her the time. While her\r\ncompanion is pressing, she, an inch higher up, is plastering.\r\n\r\nAt last the combined efforts of husband and wife result in a cylinder\r\nof the regulation length. The greater part of the well above remains\r\nempty and uncemented. Nothing tells me that the Geotrupes trouble about\r\nthis unoccupied area. Scarabæi and Copres shoot into the\r\nentrance-passage to the underground chamber a portion of the rubbish\r\nextracted; they build a barricade in front of the dwelling. The\r\nsausage-makers seem to be unfamiliar with this precaution. All the\r\nburrows which I inspect are empty in the upper part. There is no sign\r\nof excavated earth put back and pressed into position; there is merely\r\na little fallen rubbish, coming either from the dung-heap above or from\r\nthe crumbling walls.\r\n\r\nThis neglect might well be ascribed to the thick roof that surmounts\r\nthe house. Remember that the Geotrupes generally settle under the\r\ncopious provender which the Horse and the Mule bestow upon them. Under\r\nsuch a shelter, is it really necessary to bolt one’s door? Besides, the\r\nrough weather looks after the closing for them. The roof falls in, the\r\nearth slips and the yawning pit soon fills up without the assistance of\r\nthose who dug it.\r\n\r\nJust now my pen ventured to write the names of Philemon and Baucis. As\r\na matter of fact, the Geotrupes couple do in certain respects recall\r\nthe peaceful mythological household. What is the male, in the insect\r\nworld? Once the wedding has been celebrated, he is an incompetent, an\r\nidler, a good-for-nothing, a drug in the market whom others shun and\r\nsometimes even get rid of by atrocious means. The Praying Mantis [52]\r\ntells us tragic enough things in this connection.\r\n\r\nNow here, by a very curious exception, the sluggard becomes a toiler;\r\nthe lover of the moment a faithful husband; the careless parent a\r\nserious paterfamilias. The brief meeting changes into a lasting\r\npartnership. Married life, domestic life comes into being: a glorious\r\ninnovation; and the pioneer is a Dung-beetle! Go downwards: there is\r\nnothing resembling it; go upwards: for a long time there is still\r\nnothing. We have to mount to the top of the scale.\r\n\r\nTake that little fish of our brooks, the Stickleback. The male knows\r\nvery well how to build out of algæ and different water-weeds a nest, a\r\nsnuggery, in which the female will come and spawn; but he knows nothing\r\nof work shared in common. The cares of a family in which the mother\r\ntakes little interest fall upon him alone. No matter: there is one step\r\ngained, a great one and especially a very remarkable one among fishes,\r\nwho are so supremely indifferent to family-affection and substitute an\r\nappalling fecundity for the trouble of breeding. Fabulous numbers make\r\ngood the voids due to the lack of industry in the parents, even in the\r\nmother, a mere bag for eggs.\r\n\r\nCertain Toads attempt the duties of paternity; and then we have nothing\r\nmore till we come to the bird, that paragon of the domestic virtues.\r\nHere we find married life in all its moral beauty. A contract turns the\r\ncouple into two collaborators, both equally zealous for the prosperity\r\nof the family. The father takes just as much part as the mother in the\r\nbuilding of the nest, the quest of provisions, the distribution of each\r\nmouthful and the supervision of the youngsters as they try their wings\r\npreliminary to their first flight.\r\n\r\nStanding still higher in the animal scale, the mammal carries on the\r\nwonderful example without adding to it; on the contrary, it often\r\nsimplifies things. Man remains and has no prouder title to nobility\r\nthan his unwearying care for the family, that alliance which is never\r\ndissolved. To our shame, I admit, a few individuals deny their\r\nresponsibility and sink below the level of the Toad.\r\n\r\nThe Geotrupes rivals the bird. The nest is the joint production of\r\nhusband and wife. The father puts the various layers together and\r\ncompresses them; the mother plasters the walls, fetches fresh loads and\r\nplaces them under the presser’s feet. This home, the outcome of the\r\ncouple’s efforts, is also a storehouse of provisions. Here we see no\r\nmouthfuls distributed to the children from day to day, but the\r\nfood-problem is solved none the less: the united labours of the two\r\npartners result in the sumptuous sausage. Father and mother have done\r\ntheir duty splendidly; they bequeath to the grub an eminently\r\nwell-furnished larder.\r\n\r\nA pair that continue to exist as such, a couple that join forces and\r\nunite their industry for their offspring’s welfare, certainly represent\r\nenormous progress, perhaps the greatest in the animal kingdom. One day,\r\nin the midst of the isolated existences, the household appeared, the\r\ninvention of an inspired Dung-beetle. How is it that his magnificent\r\nacquirement is the property of a few, instead of extending all around,\r\nfrom one species to another, throughout the guild? Can it be that\r\nScarabæi and Copres would have nothing to gain, in saving of time and\r\nlabour, if the mother, instead of working alone, had an assistant?\r\nThings would move faster, so it seems to me, and a more numerous family\r\nwould be permissible, a possibility not to be despised when one has an\r\neye to the prosperity of the species.\r\n\r\nHow, on his side, did the Geotrupes think of combining the two sexes in\r\nbuilding the nest and stocking the larder? The abrupt transformation of\r\nthe usual airy paternity of the insect into something that rivals\r\nmotherhood in tenderness is so serious and so rare an event that we\r\nlong to discover the cause of it, if indeed we may hope to do so with\r\nthe sorry means of information at our disposal. One idea occurs to us\r\nat once: may there not be some connection between the male’s superior\r\nsize and his liking for hard work? Endowed with greater robustness and\r\nvigour than the mother, he who is usually so lazy has become a zealous\r\nhelper; the love of work has come from a surplus of unspent strength.\r\n\r\nTake care: this apparent explanation will not hold water. The two sexes\r\nof the Mimic Geotrupes scarcely differ in size; the advantage is often\r\neven in the female’s favour; and nevertheless the male lends assistance\r\nto his companion: he is as eager a well-sinker, as energetic a presser\r\nas his big stercoraceous kinsman.\r\n\r\nAnd here is a still more conclusive argument: among the Anthidia, [53]\r\nthose Bees who weave cotton-stuffs or knead resin, the male, though\r\nmuch larger than the female, is an absolute idler. He, so strong, so\r\nstout of limb, take part in the work! Never! Let the mother, the feeble\r\nmother, wear herself out while he, powerful fellow that he is, frolics\r\namong the speedwell and the lavender.\r\n\r\nIt is not physical strength, therefore, that has made the Geotrupian\r\npaterfamilias into a worker devoted to his children’s welfare. And this\r\nis as much as our investigations tell us. To pursue the problem would\r\nbe a vain endeavour. The origin of faculties escapes us. Why is this\r\ngift bestowed here and that gift there? Who knows? Can we indeed ever\r\nhope to know?\r\n\r\nOne point alone stands out clearly: instinct is not dependent on\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe Geotrupes have been known from time immemorial; conscientious\r\nentomologists, peering through their magnifying-glasses, have examined\r\nthem down to their smallest details; and no one has yet suspected their\r\nmarvellous privilege of keeping house in common. Above the monotonous\r\nlevel of the ocean suddenly emerge the headlands of lonely little\r\nislands, scattered here and there, whose existence none can suspect\r\nuntil geography has added them to her charts. Even so do the peaks of\r\ninstinct rear their crests above the ocean of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE GEOTRUPES: THE LARVA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe egg takes from one to two weeks to hatch, according as it is laid\r\nin October or September. As a rule the hatching takes place in the\r\nfirst fortnight of October. The larva grows pretty quickly and soon\r\nmanifests very different characteristics from those displayed by the\r\nother Dung-beetles. We find ourselves in a new world, full of\r\nsurprises. The grub is folded in two, it is bent into a hook, as\r\nrequired by the narrowness of the cell, which is scooped out gradually\r\nas the inside of the sausage is consumed.\r\n\r\nEven so did the grubs of the Sacred Beetle, the Copris and the others\r\ncomport themselves; but the larva of the Geotrupes has not the hump\r\nthat gave the first-named such an ungainly figure. Its back is curved\r\nregularly. This entire absence of a knapsack, of a putty-bag, points to\r\ndifferent habits. The larva, in fact, is not acquainted with the art of\r\nplugging crevices. If I contrive an opening in the part of the sausage\r\nwhich it occupies, I do not see it taking note of the hole, turning\r\nround and forthwith repairing the damage with a few pats of a trowel\r\nwell supplied with cement. The access of the air does not trouble it\r\napparently, or rather there is no provision against this in its means\r\nof defence.\r\n\r\nYou have only to take a glance at its dwelling. What would be the use\r\nof the plasterer’s art of stopping up crannies, when the house simply\r\ncannot crack? Closely moulded in the cylinder of the burrow, the\r\nsausage is preserved from crumbling to dust by the support of its\r\nmould. The Sacred Beetle’s pear, which is free on every side in a large\r\nunderground cavity, often swells, splits, peels off. The Geotrupes’\r\nsausage, being packed in a casing, is free from these imperfections.\r\nBesides, if it were to burst, the accident would not be serious, for\r\nnow, in autumn and winter, in a soil that is always damp and fresh,\r\nthere is no fear of that desiccation which is so greatly dreaded by the\r\npill-rollers. Hence there is no special industry designed to circumvent\r\na peril that is unlikely and of little consequence; no excessively\r\ndocile intestine to keep the trowel supplied; no ugly hump to act as a\r\nmortar-magazine. The inexhaustible evacuator of our earlier studies\r\ndisappears and is replaced by a grub whose motions are more moderate.\r\n\r\nObviously, big eater as the larva is and, moreover, sequestered in a\r\ncell allowing of no communication with the outside, it is utterly\r\nignorant of what we call cleanliness. Let us not take this to mean that\r\nit is disgustingly filthy, soiled with excrement: we should be making a\r\ngrave mistake. Nothing could be neater or glossier than its satiny\r\nskin. We wonder what pains it must take over its toilet, or else what\r\nspecial grace enables all these eaters of ordure to keep themselves so\r\nclean. Seeing them outside their usual environment, no one would\r\nsuspect their sordid life.\r\n\r\nWe must look elsewhere for any defect in cleanliness, if indeed it is\r\nright to give the name of defect to a quality which, all things\r\nconsidered, makes for the creature’s good. Language, the one and only\r\nmirror of our thoughts, easily goes astray and becomes treacherous when\r\nattempting to express reality. Let us substitute the larva’s point of\r\nview for our own, let us throw off the man and become the Dung-beetle:\r\noffensive epithets will disappear forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe grub, that mighty eater, has no relations with the outside world.\r\nWhat is it to do with the remains of what it has digested? Far from\r\nbeing embarrassed by them, it takes advantage of them, as do many other\r\nsolitaries cabined in a shell. It uses them to keep out the draughts\r\nfrom its hermitage and to pad it with quilting. It spreads them into a\r\nsoft couch, grateful to its delicate skin; it builds them into a\r\npolished niche, a water-tight alcove which will protect the long winter\r\ntorpor. I told you that one had but to imagine one’s self a Dung-beetle\r\nfor a moment in order to change one’s language utterly. Behold that\r\nwhich was hateful and burdensome turned into something of value, which\r\nwill contribute largely to the grub’s welfare. Onthophagi and Copres,\r\nScarabæi and Gymnopleuri have accustomed us to this kind of industry.\r\n\r\nThe sausage is in an upright position, or nearly so. The\r\nhatching-chamber is at the bottom end. As the grub grows, it attacks\r\nthe provisions overhead, but does not touch the wall around, which is\r\nof considerable thickness. It has indeed so huge a dish at its disposal\r\nthat abstinence becomes no difficult matter. The Sacred Beetle’s grub,\r\nwhich has no occasion to take precautions against the winter, has a\r\nvery skimpy helping. Its little pear is a niggardly ration and is\r\nconsumed throughout, all but a slender wall, which the inmate, however,\r\ntakes care to thicken and strengthen with a good layer of its mortar.\r\nThe grub of the Geotrupes is very differently situated. It is supplied\r\nwith a colossal sausage, representing nearly a dozen times as much as\r\nthe other provisions. However well endowed it be with stomach and\r\nappetite, it could not possibly consume the whole lot. Besides, the\r\nquestion of food is not the only one to be considered this time: there\r\nis also the serious matter of the hibernation. The parents foresaw the\r\nseverity of the winter and bequeathed their sons the wherewithal to\r\nface it. The giant roly-poly will become a blanket against the cold.\r\n\r\nThe grub, as a matter of fact, gnaws bit by bit the part above and\r\nscoops out a corridor just wide enough to pass through. In this way, a\r\nvery thick wall is left intact, the central part alone being consumed.\r\nAs the sheath is bored, the sides are at the same time cemented and\r\nlined with the evacuations of the intestine. Any excess product\r\naccumulates and forms a rampart behind.\r\n\r\nSo long as the weather remains favourable, the grub moves about in its\r\ngallery; it takes its stand above or below and attacks the provisions\r\nwith a tooth that grows daily more languid. Five or six weeks are thus\r\npassed in banqueting; then comes the cold weather, bringing the winter\r\ntorpor with it. The grub now digs itself an oval recess, polished by\r\nmuch wriggling of its body, at the lower end of its case, in the mass\r\nof material which digestion has transformed into a fine paste; it\r\nprotects itself with a curved canopy; and it is ready to enjoy its\r\nwinter slumbers. It can sleep in peace. If its parents have installed\r\nit underground at an inconsiderable depth to which the frost\r\npenetrates, at any rate they have increased the supply of victuals to\r\nthe utmost. The effect of this enormous superfluity is to provide an\r\nexcellent dwelling for the bad weather.\r\n\r\nIn December the grub is full-grown, or not far short of it. If the\r\ntemperature only lent a hand, the nymphosis would now be due. But times\r\nare hard; and the grub, in its wisdom, decides to defer the delicate\r\nwork of transformation. Sturdy creature that it is, it will be able to\r\nresist the cold much better than the nymph, that frail beginning of a\r\nnew life. It therefore has patience and tarries in a state of torpor. I\r\ntake it from its cell to examine it.\r\n\r\nConvex on top and almost flat below, the larva is a semicylinder bent\r\ninto a hook. There is an entire absence of the hump belonging to the\r\nprevious Dung-beetles; likewise of any terminal trowel. The plasterer’s\r\nart of repairing crevices being unknown here, there is no need for the\r\ncement-pot or the spreading-utensil. The creature’s skin is smooth and\r\nwhite, clouded in the hinder half by the dark contents of the\r\nintestines. Sparse hairs, some fairly long, others very short, stand up\r\non the median and dorsal region of the segments. They apparently serve\r\nto help the grub move about its cell by the mere wriggling of its\r\nhinder part. The head is neither big nor small and is pale-yellow in\r\ncolour; the mandibles are large and brown at the tip.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave these details, which are of no great interest, and say\r\nat once that the creature’s prominent characteristic is supplied by its\r\nlegs. The first two pairs are pretty long, especially for an animal\r\nleading a sedentary life in a narrow cabin. They are normally\r\nconstructed; and it must be their strength that allows the grub to\r\nclamber about inside its pudding, converted into a sheath by eating.\r\nBut the third pair presents a peculiarity of which I know no example\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe limbs forming this pair are rudimentary legs, crippled from birth,\r\nimpotent, arrested in their development. They give one the impression\r\nof lifeless stumps. Their length is hardly a third of that of the\r\nothers. More remarkable still, instead of pointing downwards like the\r\nnormal legs, they shrivel upwards, turning towards the back, and remain\r\nindefinitely in that queer attitude, twisted and stiff. I cannot\r\nsucceed in seeing the animal make the slightest use of them.\r\nNevertheless they show the same joints as the others; but this is all\r\non a greatly reduced scale, pale and inert. In short, a couple of words\r\nwill distinguish the Geotrupes’ larva without any possibility of\r\nconfusion: hind-legs atrophied.\r\n\r\nThis feature is so plain, so striking, so extraordinary that the least\r\nobservant among us cannot mistake it. A grub crippled by nature and so\r\nevidently crippled enforces itself on our attention. What do the books\r\nsay about it? Nothing, so far as I know. The few which I have with me\r\nare silent on this point. Mulsant, it is true, described the larva of\r\nthe Stercoraceous Geotrupes; but he makes no mention of its exceptional\r\nstructure. In his anxiety to describe the minutest details of the\r\norganism, has he lost sight of this monstrosity? Labrum, palpi,\r\nantennæ, the number of joints, the hairs: all this is set down and\r\nscrutinized; and the lifeless legs reduced to stumps are passed over in\r\nsilence. Are the experts then so busy with the Gnat that they cannot\r\nsee the Camel? I give it up.\r\n\r\nObserve also that the hind-legs of the perfect insect are longer and\r\nstronger than the middle-legs and vie with the fore-legs in vigour. The\r\natrophied limbs of the grub, therefore, become the adult’s powerful\r\npressing-machine; the impotent stumps change into strong\r\nstamping-tools.\r\n\r\nWho will tell us the origin of these anomalies now thrice observed\r\namong the dung-workers? The Sacred Beetle, who is sound in every limb\r\nduring his infancy, loses his fore-fingers when the adult form appears;\r\nthe Onthophagus, who sports a horn on his thorax in his nymphal stage,\r\ndrops it and does without the ornament in the end; the Geotrupes, at\r\nfirst a limping grub, turns his useless stumps into the best of his\r\nlevers. The last-named makes progress; the others retrocede. Why does\r\nthe cripple become able-bodied and why do the able-bodied become\r\ncripples?\r\n\r\nWe make chemical analyses of the suns; we surprise the nebulæ in labour\r\nand watch the birth of worlds; and shall we never know why a miserable\r\ngrub is born limping? Come, ye divers who fathom life’s mysteries,\r\ndescend a little lower into the depths and at least bring us back that\r\nhumble pearl, the reply to the problems of the Geotrupes and the Sacred\r\nBeetle!\r\n\r\nWhen the weather is severe, what becomes of the larva in the retreat\r\nwhich it has succeeded in making at the far end of its box? The\r\nexceptional cold of January and February 1895 will answer this\r\nquestion. My cages, always left in the open air, had repeatedly\r\nundergone a drop in temperature of some ten degrees below\r\nfreezing-point. In this arctic weather, I conceived a wish to go in\r\nsearch of information and learn how things were progressing in my\r\nunprotected cages.\r\n\r\nI could not manage it. The bed of earth, wetted by the earlier rains,\r\nhad become a compact block throughout, which I should have had to break\r\nup like a stone with a hammer and chisel. Extraction by violent means\r\nwas not practicable: I should have endangered everything with my\r\nhammering. On the other hand, if any life remained in the frozen mass,\r\nI should have placed it in jeopardy by changing the temperature too\r\nsuddenly. It was better to await the very slow natural thaw.\r\n\r\nEarly in March I inspect the cages again. This time there is no ice\r\nleft. The earth is yielding and easy to dig. All the adult Geotrupes\r\nhave died, bequeathing me a fresh supply of sausages, almost as\r\nplentiful as that which I had gathered and placed in safety in October.\r\nThey have all perished; there is not a single survivor. Is cold or old\r\nage to blame?\r\n\r\nAt this very time and later, in April and May, when the new generation\r\nis wholly in the larval or at most in the nymphal stage, I often find\r\nadult Geotrupes busy in their scavenging-works. The old ones therefore\r\nsee a second spring; they live long enough to know their children and\r\nto work with them, as do the Scarabæi, the Copres and others. These\r\nearly ones are veterans. They have escaped the hardships of winter\r\nbecause they have been able to bury themselves far enough underground.\r\nMine, kept captive between a few boards, have died for want of a\r\nsufficiently deep pit. At a time when they needed three feet of earth\r\nto shelter themselves, they had less than twelve inches. It was cold,\r\ntherefore, that killed them, rather than age.\r\n\r\nThe low temperature, while fatal to the adult, has spared the larva.\r\nThe few sausages left in position after my October diggings contain the\r\ngrub in excellent condition. The protecting sheath has fulfilled its\r\noffice to perfection: it has preserved the sons from the catastrophe\r\nthat caused the death of the parents.\r\n\r\nThe other cylinders, fashioned in the course of November, contain\r\nsomething even more remarkable. In their hatching-chamber, at the\r\nbottom, they hold an egg, all plump and shiny and as healthy-looking as\r\nthough it had been laid that day. Can life still exist there? Is it\r\npossible, after the best part of the winter has been passed in a block\r\nof ice? I dare not believe it. The sausage itself has not an attractive\r\nappearance. It is darkened by fermentation, smells musty and does not\r\nsuggest food worth having.\r\n\r\nAt all events, I will take the precaution of bottling the miserable\r\npuddings, after ascertaining that the egg is there in each case. I was\r\nwell-advised. The fresh aspect of the germs, after wintering under such\r\nrude conditions, did not belie them. The hatching was soon effected;\r\nand early in May the late arrivals were almost as well-developed as\r\ntheir seniors, hatched in the autumn.\r\n\r\nSome interesting facts are revealed by this piece of observation. First\r\nof all, the laying-period of the Geotrupes is a fairly long one,\r\nlasting from September to some time in November. At that date the first\r\nhoar-frosts begin; the soil is not warm enough to hatch the eggs; and\r\nthe last ones, unable to hatch as swiftly as their predecessors, wait\r\nfor the return of the fine weather. A few mild April days are enough to\r\nreawaken their suspended vitality. Then the usual evolution goes on,\r\nand this so rapidly that, notwithstanding a delay of five or six\r\nmonths, the backward larvæ are very nearly as big as the others by May,\r\nwhen the first nymphs appear.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Geotrupes’ eggs are capable of enduring the trials of\r\nsevere cold unscathed. I do not know the exact temperature inside the\r\nfrozen block which I tried to tackle with a mason’s chisel. Outside,\r\nthe thermometer sometimes fell to ten degrees below freezing-point;\r\nand, as the cold period lasted a long time, we may believe that the\r\nlayer of earth in my boxes was equally cold. Now the Geotrupes’\r\npuddings were enclosed in that frozen mass turned to a block of stone.\r\nA generous allowance must no doubt be made for the non-conductivity of\r\nthese puddings composed of thready materials; the wall of dung did, to\r\na certain extent, protect the larva and the egg against the biting\r\ncold, which, if experienced direct, would have been fatal. No matter:\r\nin that atmosphere the dung-cylinders, damp at the start, must in the\r\nlong run have acquired the hardness of stone. In their\r\nhatching-chamber, in the tunnel made by the larva, the temperature\r\nundoubtedly sank below freezing-point.\r\n\r\nThen what became of the grub and the egg? Were they really frozen?\r\nEverything seems to tell us so. That this most delicate of all delicate\r\nthings, a germ, a rudiment of life in a blob of glair, should harden,\r\nturn into a bit of stone and then resume its vitality and continue its\r\nevolution after thawing seems inadmissible. And yet circumstances\r\nconfirm it. We should have to credit the Geotrupes’ sausages with\r\nathermanous properties unequalled by any other substance to regard them\r\nas a sufficient protection against such intense and lasting\r\nrefrigeration. What a pity that we could derive no information from the\r\nthermometer in this instance! After all, if complete freezing is\r\nunproven, one point has been established for certain: the egg and the\r\ngrub of the Geotrupes can support and survive very low temperatures in\r\ntheir protecting sheath.\r\n\r\nSince the occasion presents itself, let me say a few more words on the\r\ninsect’s powers of resisting cold. Some years ago, while looking for\r\nScolia-cocoons in a heap of mould, I had made a large collection of the\r\ngrubs of Cetonia aurata. [54] I placed my loot in a flower-pot with a\r\nfew handfuls of decayed vegetable matter, just enough to cover the\r\ninsects’ backs. I intended to draw upon them for certain enquiries\r\nwhich I was making at the time. The pot remained in the open air; and I\r\nforgot all about it. A cold snap came, accompanied by sharp frost and\r\nsnow. Then I remembered my Cetoniæ, so ill-protected against this kind\r\nof weather. I found the contents of the pot hardened into a\r\nconglomeration of earth, dead leaves, ice, snow and shrivelled grubs.\r\nIt was a sort of almond-rock, in which the larvæ stood for the almonds.\r\nSorely tried by the cold as they were, the colony ought to have\r\nperished. But no: when the thaw arrived, the frozen larvæ came to life\r\nagain and began to swarm about as though nothing unusual had happened.\r\n\r\nThe insect’s powers of endurance are less great than the larva’s. As\r\nthe organization becomes more refined, it loses its robustness. My\r\ncages, which went through such a bad time in the winter of 1895,\r\nprovided me with a striking instance. A few species—Scarabæi, Copres,\r\nPilularii and Onthophagi—were represented at the same time by newcomers\r\nand old stagers. All the Geotrupes, without an exception, died in the\r\nearthy bed which had turned into a block of stone; the Minotaurs also\r\nsuccumbed, every one of them. And yet both find their way up north and\r\nare not afraid of cold climates. On the other hand, the southern\r\nspecies, the Sacred Beetle, the Spanish Copris and Pilularius\r\nflagellatus, the younger generation as well as the veterans, withstood\r\nthe winter better than I dared hope. Many of them died, it is true;\r\nthey formed the majority; but at any rate there were survivors whom I\r\nmarvelled to see recovering from their icy paralysis, trotting about\r\nunder the first kisses of the sun. In April, those specimens which have\r\nescaped from freezing resume their labours. They teach me that, when at\r\nliberty, Copres and Scarabæi have no need to retire to winter quarters\r\nat great depths underground. A moderate screen of earth, in some\r\nsheltered nook, is enough for them. Less skilful diggers than the\r\nGeotrupes, they are better provided with the power to resist a passing\r\nspell of cold.\r\n\r\nWe will end this digression by remarking, as so many others have done,\r\nthat agriculture cannot reckon on the cold weather to rid it of its\r\ndread enemy, the insect. Very hard frosts, lasting a long time and\r\npenetrating well beneath the surface of the soil, can destroy various\r\nspecies which are not able to go down low enough; but a great many\r\nsurvive. Moreover, the grub and especially the egg in many cases defy\r\nour severest winters.\r\n\r\nThe first five days of April put an end to the torpor of the larvæ of\r\nboth Geotrupes, snuggling on the bottom floor of their cylinder, in a\r\ntemporary cell. Activity returns, bringing with it a last flicker of\r\nappetite. The remains of the autumn banquet are plentiful. The grub\r\nmakes use of them no longer for greedy feasting, but just as a midnight\r\nsnack between two slumbers, that of winter and the deeper sleep of the\r\nmetamorphosis. Hence the sides of the sheath are attacked\r\nspasmodically. Breaches yawn, sections of wall come tumbling down, and\r\nsoon the edifice is nothing but an unrecognizable ruin.\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of the original sausage remains, however, with its\r\nwalls intact for a length of an inch or two. Here, in a thick layer,\r\nthe grub’s excreta are accumulated, held in reserve for the final work.\r\nIn the centre of this mass a hollow is dug, carefully polished inside.\r\nWith the excavated rubbish the grub builds not just a canopy, like that\r\nwith which the winter alcove was protected, but a solid lid, with a\r\nrough outer surface, in appearance not unlike the work of the Cetoniæ\r\nwhen they wrap themselves in a shell of mould. This lid, with what is\r\nleft of the pudding, forms a habitation which would remind us pretty\r\nclosely of the Cockchafer’s dwelling, were it not truncated in the\r\nupper part, which moreover is most often topped by a few remnants from\r\nthe destroyed cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe grub is now shut in for the transformation, motionless, with its\r\nbody emptied of all dross. In a few days a blister appears on the\r\ndorsal surface of the last abdominal segments. This swells, spreads and\r\ngradually extends as far as the thorax. It is the work of excoriation\r\nbeginning. Distended by a colourless liquid, the blister gives an\r\nuncertain glimpse of a sort of milky cloud, the first blurred outline\r\nof the new organism.\r\n\r\nThe thorax splits in front, the cast skin is slowly pushed backwards,\r\nand at last we have the nymph, all white, half-opaque and\r\nhalf-crystalline. I obtain my first nymphs about the beginning of May.\r\n\r\nFour or five weeks later, the perfect insect arrives, white on the\r\nwing-cases and belly, while the rest of the body already possesses the\r\nnormal colouring. The chromatic evolution is quickly completed; and,\r\nbefore the end of June, the Geotrupes, now perfectly matured, emerges\r\nfrom the soil at twilight and flies off to start on his scavenger’s job\r\nwithout delay. The laggards, those whose egg has gone through the\r\nwinter, are still in the white nymphal stage when their elders effect\r\ntheir release. Not before September is nigh will they burst their natal\r\nshell and, in their turn, sally forth to aid in the cleansing of the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE SISYPHUS: THE INSTINCT OF PATERNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duties of paternity are hardly ever imposed on any except the\r\nhigher animals. The bird excels in them; and the furred folk perform\r\nthem honourably. Lower in the scale, the father is generally\r\nindifferent to his family. Very few insects form exceptions to this\r\nrule. Whereas all display a frenzied ardour in propagating their\r\nspecies, nearly all, having satisfied the passion of the moment,\r\npromptly break off domestic relations and retire, heedless of their\r\nbrood, which must do the best that it can for itself.\r\n\r\nThis paternal coldness, which would be detestable in the higher ranks\r\nof the animal kingdom, where the weakness of the young demands\r\nprolonged assistance, has here as its excuse the robustness of the\r\nnew-born insect, which is able unaided to gather its food, provided\r\nthat it be in a propitious place. When all that the Pieris need do, to\r\nsafeguard the prosperity of the race, is to lay her eggs on the leaves\r\nof a cabbage, what use would a father’s solicitude be? The mother’s\r\nbotanical instinct requires no assistance. At laying-time, the other\r\nparent would be an obstacle. Let him go and flirt elsewhere; he would\r\nonly be in the way at this critical season.\r\n\r\nMost insects are equally summary in their educational methods. They\r\nhave but to choose the refectory which will be the home of the family\r\nonce it is hatched, or else a place that will allow their young to find\r\nsuitable fare for themselves. There is no need for the father in these\r\ncases. After the wedding, therefore, the unoccupied male, henceforth\r\nuseless, drags out a languid existence for a few days more and at last\r\ndies without lending the least assistance in the work of setting up his\r\noffspring in life.\r\n\r\nThings do not always happen in quite such a primitive fashion. There\r\nare tribes that provide a dower for their families, that prepare board\r\nand lodging for them in advance. The Bees and Wasps, in particular, are\r\nmasters in the industry of making cellars, jars and satchels in which\r\nthe mess of honey for the young is hoarded; they are perfect in the art\r\nof creating burrows stocked with the game that forms the food of their\r\ngrubs.\r\n\r\nWell, this enormous labour, which is one of building and provisioning\r\ncombined, this toil, in which the insect’s whole life is spent, is done\r\nby the mother alone. It wears her out, it utterly exhausts her. The\r\nfather, drunk with sunlight, stands by the edge of the workyard\r\nwatching his plucky helpmate at her job and considers himself to have\r\ndone all the work that he is called upon to do when he has toyed a\r\nlittle with his fair neighbours.\r\n\r\nWhy does he not lend the mother a helping hand? It is now or never. Why\r\ndoes he not follow the example of the Swallow couple, both of whom\r\nbring their bit of straw, their blob of mortar to the building, their\r\nMidge to the brood? He does nothing of the kind, perhaps alleging his\r\ncomparative weakness as an excuse. It is a poor argument, for to cut a\r\ndisk out of a leaf, to scrape some cotton from a downy plant, to\r\ncollect a little bit of cement in muddy places would not overtax his\r\nstrength. He could very easily help, at any rate as a labourer; he is\r\nquite fit to gather the materials for the mother, with her greater\r\nintelligence, to fix in place. The real reason of his inactivity is\r\nsheer ineptitude.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that the Hymenopteron, the most gifted of the industrial\r\ninsects, should know nothing of paternal labour. The male, in whom one\r\nwould think that the needs of the young ought to develop the highest\r\naptitudes, remains as dull-witted as a Butterfly, whose family is\r\nestablished at so small a cost. The bestowal of instinct baffles our\r\nmost reasonable conjectures.\r\n\r\nIt baffles them so thoroughly that we are extremely surprised when we\r\nfind in the muck-raker the noble prerogative denied to the\r\nhoney-gatherer. Various Dung-beetles are accustomed to help in the\r\nburden of housekeeping and know the value of working in double harness.\r\nRemember the Geotrupes couple, preparing their larva’s portion\r\ntogether; think of the father lending his mate the assistance of his\r\npowerful press in the manufacture of the tight-packed sausages, a\r\nsplendid example of domestic habits and one extremely surprising amid\r\nthe general egoism.\r\n\r\nTo this example, hitherto unique, my constant studies of the subject\r\nenable me to-day to add three others, which are equally interesting;\r\nand all three are likewise furnished by the Dung-beetle guild. I will\r\ndescribe them, but briefly, for in many particulars their story is the\r\nsame as that of the Sacred Beetle, the Spanish Copris and the others.\r\n\r\nThe first case is that of the Sisyphus (S. Schæfferi, Lin.), the\r\nsmallest and most zealous of our pill-rollers. He is the liveliest and\r\nmost agile of them all, recking nothing of awkward somersaults and\r\nheadlong falls on the impossible tracks to which his obstinacy brings\r\nhim back again and again. It was in memory of these wild gymnastics\r\nthat Latreille gave him the name of Sisyphus, famous in the annals of\r\nTartarus. The unhappy wretch had the terrible task of having to roll a\r\nhuge stone up hill; and each time he had toiled to the top of the\r\nmountain the stone would slip from his grasp and roll to the bottom.\r\nTry again, poor Sisyphus, try again and go on trying: your punishment\r\nwill not be over until the rock is firmly fixed up there.\r\n\r\nI like this myth. It is in a fashion the history of a good many of us,\r\nnot detestable scoundrels worthy of eternal torments, but decent,\r\nhard-working folk, doing their duty by their neighbours. They have one\r\ncrime only to expiate: that of poverty. So far as I am concerned, for\r\nhalf a century and more I have painfully climbed that steep ascent,\r\nleaving garments stained with blood and sweat on its sharp crags; I\r\nhave strained every nerve, drained myself dry, spent my strength\r\nrecklessly in the struggle to hoist up to safety that crushing burden,\r\nmy daily bread; and hardly is the loaf balanced when it slips off,\r\nslides down and is lost in the abyss. Try again, poor Sisyphus, try\r\nagain until the load, falling for the last time, smashes your head and\r\nsets you free at last.\r\n\r\nThe Sisyphus of the naturalists knows none of these bitter trials.\r\nUntroubled by the steep slopes, he gaily trundles his load, at one time\r\nbread for himself, at another for his children. He is very scarce in\r\nthese parts; and I should never have managed to procure a suitable\r\nnumber of subjects for my purpose, but for an assistant whom I ought to\r\npresent to the reader, for he will play his part more than once in\r\nthese narratives.\r\n\r\nI speak of my son Paul, a little chap of seven. My assiduous companion\r\non my hunting-expeditions, he knows better than any one of his age the\r\nsecrets of the Cicada, the Locust, the Cricket and especially the\r\nDung-beetle, his great delight. Twenty paces away, his sharp eyes will\r\ndistinguish the real mound that marks a burrow from casual heaps of\r\nearth; his delicate ears catch the Grasshopper’s faint stridulation,\r\nwhich to me remains silence. He lends me his sight and hearing; and I,\r\nin exchange, present him with ideas, which he receives attentively,\r\nraising wide, blue, questioning eyes to mine.\r\n\r\nOh, what an adorable thing is the first blossoming of the intellect;\r\nwhat a beautiful age is that when innocent curiosity awakens, enquiring\r\ninto all things! So little Paul has his own vivarium, in which the\r\nSacred Beetle makes pears for him; his own little garden, no larger\r\nthan a pocket-handkerchief, where he grows beans, often digging them up\r\nto see if the tiny roots are growing longer; his forest plantation, in\r\nwhich stand four oaks a hand’s-breadth high, still furnished on one\r\nside with the twin-breasted acorn that feeds them. It all makes a\r\nwelcome change from dry grammar, which gets on none the worse for it.\r\n\r\nWhat beautiful and delightful things natural history could put into\r\nchildren’s heads if science would but stoop to charm the young; if our\r\nbarracks of colleges would but add the living study of the fields to\r\nthe lifeless study of books; if the red tape of the curriculum beloved\r\nby bureaucrats did not strangle any eager initiative! Little Paul, my\r\nboy, let us study as much as we can in the open country, among the\r\nrosemary- and arbutus-shrubs. By so doing, we shall gain in vigour of\r\nbody and mind; we shall find more of the true and the beautiful than in\r\nany old musty books.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are giving the blackboard a rest; it is a holiday. We get up\r\nearly, in view of the contemplated expedition, so early indeed that you\r\nwill have to start without your breakfast. Have no fear: when your\r\nappetite comes, we will call a halt in the shade and you shall find in\r\nmy bag the usual viaticum, an apple and a piece of bread. The month of\r\nMay is near at hand; the Sisyphus must have appeared. What we have to\r\ndo now is to explore, at the foot of the mountain, the lean meadows\r\nwhere the flocks have been; we shall have to break with our fingers,\r\none by one, the cakes dropped by the Sheep and baked by the sun, but\r\nstill retaining a kernel of crumb under their crust. There we shall\r\nfind the Sisyphus huddled, waiting for the fresher windfall with which\r\nthe evening grazers will supply him.\r\n\r\nInstructed in this secret, which I learnt long ago from chance\r\ndiscoveries, little Paul forthwith becomes a master in the art of\r\nshelling Sheep-droppings. He displays such zeal and such an instinct\r\nfor the best morsels that, after a very few halts, I am rich beyond my\r\nfondest hopes. Behold me the proud owner of six couples of Sisyphi, an\r\nunprecedented treasure, which I was far from expecting.\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to rear these in the vivarium. A wire-gauze\r\ncover is enough, with a bed of sand and a supply of victuals to their\r\nliking. They are so small, hardly the size of a cherry-stone! And so\r\ncurious in shape withal! Dumpy body: the hinder end pointed; and very\r\nlong legs, resembling a Spider’s when outspread: the hind-legs are of\r\ninordinate length and curved, which is most useful for clasping and\r\nsqueezing the pellet.\r\n\r\nPairing takes place about the beginning of May, on the surface of the\r\nground, amid the remains of the cake on which the couple have been\r\nfeasting. Soon the time comes for establishing the family. With equal\r\nzeal, husband and wife alike take part in kneading, carting and stowing\r\naway the bread for the children. With the cleaver of the fore-legs a\r\nmorsel of the right size is cut from the lump placed at their disposal.\r\nFather and mother manipulate the piece together, giving it little pats,\r\npressing it and fashioning it into a ball as large as a big pea.\r\n\r\nAs in the Sacred Beetle’s workshop, the mathematically round shape is\r\nobtained without the mechanical trick of rolling the ball. The fragment\r\nis modelled into a sphere before it is moved, before it is even\r\nloosened from its support. Here again we have an expert in geometry\r\nfamiliar with the form that is best adapted to make preserved\r\nfoodstuffs keep for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe pellet is soon ready. It must now, by vigorous rolling, be made to\r\nacquire the crust which will protect the crumb from too-rapid\r\nevaporation. The mother, who can be recognized by her slightly larger\r\nsize, harnesses herself in the place of honour, in front. With her long\r\nhind-legs on the ground and her fore-legs on the ball, she hauls it\r\ntowards her backwards. The father pushes behind in the reverse\r\nposition, head downwards. It is precisely the same method as the Sacred\r\nBeetle’s, when working in twos, but with another object. The Sisyphus\r\nteam convey a larva’s dowry, whereas the big pill-rollers trundle a\r\nbanquet which the two fortuitous partners will eat up underground.\r\n\r\nThe couple start, for no definite goal, across such impediments as the\r\nground may present. These obstacles are impossible to avoid in this\r\nbackward march; and, if they were perceived, the Sisyphus would not try\r\nto go round them, as witness her obstinacy in trying to climb the\r\nwirework of the cage. This is an arduous and impracticable enterprise.\r\nClawing the meshes of the gauze with her hind-legs, the mother pulls\r\nthe load towards her; then, putting her fore-legs round it, she holds\r\nit suspended. The father, finding nothing to stand upon, clings to the\r\nball, encrusts himself in it, so to speak, adding his weight to that of\r\nthe lump and taking no further pains. The effort is too great to last.\r\nThe ball and its rider, forming one mass, fall to the floor. The\r\nmother, from above, looks for a moment in surprise and forthwith drops\r\ndown to recover the load and renew her impossible attempt to scale the\r\nside. After repeated falls, the ascent is abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe carting on level ground is not effected without impediment either.\r\nAt every moment the load swerves on the mound made by a bit of gravel;\r\nand the team topple over and kick about, with their bellies in the air.\r\nThis is a trifle, the veriest trifle. The two pick themselves up and\r\nresume their positions as cheerily as ever. These tumbles, which so\r\noften fling the Sisyphus on his back, cause him no concern; one would\r\neven think that they were sought for. After all, the pill has to be\r\nmatured, to receive consistency. And, under these conditions, bumps,\r\nblows, falls and jolts are all part of the programme. This mad\r\nsteeplechasing goes on for hours.\r\n\r\nAt last the mother, regarding the work as completed, goes off a little\r\nway in search of a favourable site. The father mounts guard, squatting\r\non the treasure. If his companion’s absence be prolonged, he relieves\r\nhis boredom by spinning the ball nimbly between his uplifted hind-legs.\r\nHe juggles after a fashion with the precious pellet; he tests its\r\nperfection with the curved branches of his compasses. To see him\r\nfrisking in that jubilant attitude, who can doubt his lively\r\nsatisfaction as a paterfamilias assured of the future of his children?\r\n\r\n‘It’s I,’ he seems to say, ‘it’s I who kneaded this round, soft loaf;\r\nit’s I who made this bread for my sons!’\r\n\r\nAnd he lifts on high, for all to see, this magnificent testimonial to\r\nhis industry.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the mother has selected the site. A shallow pit is made, a\r\nmere beginning of the projected burrow. The ball is rolled near it. The\r\nfather, that vigilant guardian, does not let go, while the mother digs\r\nwith her legs and forehead. Soon the hollow is big enough to hold the\r\npellet, the sacred thing which she insists on having quite close to\r\nher: she must feel it bobbing up and down behind her, on her back, safe\r\nfrom parasites, before she decides to go farther. She is afraid of what\r\nmight happen to the little loaf if it were left on the threshold of the\r\nburrow until the home was completed. There are plenty of Aphodii and\r\nMidges to grab it. One cannot be too careful.\r\n\r\nThe pellet therefore is inserted, half in and half out of the\r\npartly-formed basin. The mother, underneath, gets her legs round it and\r\npulls; the father, above, lets it down gently and sees that the hole is\r\nnot choked up with falling earth. All goes well. The digging is resumed\r\nand the descent continues, always with the same caution, one of the\r\nSisyphi pulling the load, the other regulating the drop and clearing\r\naway anything that might hinder the operation. A few more efforts; and\r\nthe ball disappears underground with the two miners. What follows for\r\nsome time to come can be only a repetition of what we have just seen.\r\nLet us wait half a day or so.\r\n\r\nIf we have kept careful watch, we shall see the father come up again to\r\nthe surface by himself and crouch in the sand near the burrow. Detained\r\nbelow by duties in which her companion can be of no assistance to her,\r\nthe mother usually postpones her appearance till the morrow. At last\r\nshe shows herself. The father leaves the place where he was snoozing\r\nand joins her. The reunited couple go back to the heap of victuals,\r\nrefresh themselves and then cut out another piece, on which again the\r\ntwo work together, both as regards the modelling and the carting and\r\nstoring.\r\n\r\nI am delighted with this conjugal fidelity. That it is really the rule\r\nI dare not declare. There must be flighty Beetles who, in the\r\nhurly-burly under a spreading cake, forget the first fair pastry-cook\r\nwhom they helped with her baking and devote themselves to others, met\r\nby chance; there must be temporary couples, who divorce each other\r\nafter producing a single pill. No matter: the little that I have seen\r\ngives me a high opinion of the Sisyphus’ domestic habits.\r\n\r\nLet us recapitulate these habits before passing on to the contents of\r\nthe burrow. The father works just as hard as the mother at extracting\r\nand modelling the lump that is to constitute a larva’s dowry; he shares\r\nin the carting, even though he plays a secondary part; he keeps watch\r\nover the loaf when the mother is absent looking for a spot at which to\r\ndig the burrow; he helps in the work of excavation; he carries outside\r\nthe rubbish from the cavity; and lastly, to crown these good qualities,\r\nhe is to a large extent faithful to his spouse.\r\n\r\nThe Scarabæus displays some of these characteristics. He readily helps\r\nin manipulating the pill; when it has to be carted, he takes his place\r\nin a team of two, one pulling and one pushing. But let me repeat that\r\nthe motive of this mutual service is selfishness: the two\r\nfellow-workers labour and cart the lump only for their own purpose. To\r\nthem it is a gala cake and nothing more. In that part of her work which\r\nconcerns the family, the Scarabæus mother has no assistant. Alone she\r\nrounds her sphere, extracts it from the pile, rolls it backwards by\r\nherself in the head-downward posture adopted by the male of the\r\nSisyphus couple; alone she digs her burrow; alone she stores away its\r\ncontents. Heedless of the laying mother and the brood, the other sex\r\ndoes not assist at all in the exhausting task. How different from the\r\npigmy pill-roller!\r\n\r\nIt is time to inspect the burrow. At no great depth we find a tiny\r\nniche, just large enough to allow the mother to move around her work.\r\nThe smallness of the chamber tells us that the father cannot remain\r\nthere for long. When the studio is ready, he must go away to leave the\r\nsculptress room to turn. We have already seen him coming back to the\r\nsurface some time before the mother.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the cellar consist of a single pill, a masterpiece of\r\nplastic art. It is a copy of the Sacred Beetle’s pear on a very much\r\nreduced scale, its smallness making the polish of the surface and the\r\nelegance of the curves all the more striking. Its main diameter varies\r\nbetween one-half and three-quarters of an inch. It is the most artistic\r\nachievement of the Dung-beetle’s art.\r\n\r\nBut this perfection is of brief duration. Soon the pretty pear is\r\ncovered with knotty excrescences, black and twisted, which disfigure it\r\nwith their blotchy lumps. A part of the surface, otherwise intact,\r\ndisappears beneath an amorphous mass of eruptions. The origin of these\r\nugly warts baffled me at first. I suspected some fungous growth, some\r\nSphæriacea, for instance, recognizable by its black and pimply crust.\r\nThe larva showed me my mistake.\r\n\r\nAs usual, this is a grub bent into a hook and carrying on its back a\r\nlarge pouch or hump, the emblem of a ready evacuator. Like the Sacred\r\nBeetle’s, indeed, it excels at stopping up any accidental holes in its\r\nshells with an instantaneous spray of stercoral cement, of which it\r\nalways keeps a supply in its knapsack. It practises moreover an art of\r\nvermicelli-making which is unknown to the pill-rollers, except the\r\nBroad-necked Scarab, who however but seldom makes use of it.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the various Dung-beetles employ their digestive residues\r\nfor plastering their cell, whose dimensions lend themselves to this\r\nmethod of riddance, without the necessity of opening temporary windows\r\nthrough which to expel the ordure. Whether because of insufficient\r\nspace or for other reasons which escape me, the Sisyphus-larva, after\r\nallowing for the regulation coating of the interior, ejects the excess\r\nof its products outside.\r\n\r\nLet us keep a close eye on a pear whose inmate is already growing\r\nfairly big. Sooner or later we shall see that the surface at one point\r\nis getting thinner and softer; and then, through the frail screen,\r\nthere is a spurt of dark-green fluid, which subsides with corkscrew\r\nevolutions. One more wart has been formed. It will turn black as it\r\ndries.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened? The larva has made a temporary breach in the wall of\r\nits shell; and through the ventilator, which is still covered with a\r\nthin veil, it has excreted the superfluous cement which it was unable\r\nto use indoors. It has evacuated through the wall. The window\r\ndeliberately opened in no way affects the safety of the grub, as it is\r\nat once closed and hermetically sealed with the base of the spout,\r\nwhich is compressed by a stroke of the trowel. With a stopper so\r\nquickly placed in position the food will keep fresh however many holes\r\nare made in the body of the pear. There is no danger of the dry air\r\nentering.\r\n\r\nThe Sisyphus also seems to be aware of the peril which later, in torrid\r\nweather, would threaten her tiny pear, buried at so slight a depth. She\r\nis a very early arrival. She works in April and May, when the\r\natmosphere is mild. In the first fortnight of July, before the terrible\r\ndog-days have arrived, her family burst their shells and go in search\r\nof the heap that will furnish them with board and lodging during the\r\nscorching time of the year. Then comes the brief spell of autumn\r\nrevelry, followed by the withdrawal underground for the winter sleep,\r\nthe awakening in spring, and lastly, to complete the cycle, the\r\npill-rolling festival.\r\n\r\nOne more observation about the Sisyphus. My six pairs under the\r\nwire-gauze cover gave me fifty-seven inhabited pellets. This census\r\nshows an average of over nine births to each couple, a figure which the\r\nSacred Beetle is far from reaching. To what cause are we to attribute\r\nthis flourishing brood? I can see but one: the fact that the male works\r\nas well as the mother. Family burdens that would exceed the strength of\r\none are not too heavy when there are two to bear them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE LUNARY COPRIS; THE BISON ONITIS\r\n\r\n\r\nSmaller than the Spanish Copris and less particular about a mild\r\nclimate, the Lunary Copris (C. lunaris, Lin.) will confirm what the\r\nSisyphus has told us of the part played by the father’s collaboration\r\nin the prosperity of the family. Our country districts cannot show his\r\nmatch for oddity of male attire. Like the other, he wears a horn on his\r\nforehead; in addition, he has an embattled promontory in the middle of\r\nhis corselet and a halberd-point and a deep, crescent-shaped groove on\r\nhis shoulders. The climate of Provence and the niggardly supply of food\r\nin a wilderness of thyme do not suit him. He wants a country that is\r\nless dry, with meadows where the patches of cattle-dung will supply him\r\nwith plenty of provender.\r\n\r\nUnable to reckon on the rare specimens which we meet here from time to\r\ntime, I have stocked my insect-house with strangers sent from Tournon\r\nby my daughter Aglaé. When April comes, she conducts an indefatigable\r\nsearch at my request. Seldom have so many Cow-claps been lifted with\r\nthe point of the sunshade; seldom have delicate fingers with so much\r\naffection broken the cakes on the pastures. I thank the heroine in the\r\nname of science!\r\n\r\nHer zeal meets with due reward. I become the proud possessor of six\r\ncouples, which are immediately installed in the insect-house where the\r\nSpanish Copris used to work last year. I serve up the national dish,\r\nthe superlative loaf furnished by my neighbour’s Cow. There is not a\r\nsign of home-sickness among the exiles, who bravely begin their labours\r\nunder the mysterious shelter of the cake.\r\n\r\nI make my first excavation in the middle of June and am delighted with\r\nwhat my knife gradually lays bare as it cuts up the soil in thin\r\nslices. Each couple has dug itself a splendid vaulted room in the sand,\r\nmore spacious than any that the Sacred Beetle or the Spanish Copris\r\never showed me and with a bolder arch. The greatest breadth is fully\r\nsix inches; but the ceiling is very low, rising to hardly two inches.\r\n\r\nThe contents correspond with the extravagant dimensions of the hall.\r\nThey form a dish worthy of the wedding of Camacho the Rich, a cake as\r\nbroad as one’s hand, of no great thickness and varying in outline. I\r\nhave found them oval-shaped, kidney-shaped, shaped like a Starfish,\r\nwith short, thick rays, and long and pointed, like a Cat’s tongue.\r\nThese minor details represent the pastry-cook’s fancies. The essential\r\nand constant fact is this: in the six bakeries of my insect-house, the\r\nsexes are always both present beside the lump of paste, which, after\r\nbeing kneaded according to rule, is now fermenting and maturing.\r\n\r\nWhat does this long cohabitation prove? It proves that the father has\r\ntaken part in digging the cellar, in storing the victuals gathered by\r\nseparate armfuls on the threshold of the door, and in kneading all the\r\nscraps into a single lump, which is more likely to improve by keeping.\r\nWere he a useless, idle incubus, he would not stay there, he would go\r\nback to the surface. The father therefore is a diligent fellow-worker.\r\nHis assistance even looks as if it ought to extend farther still. We\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\nDear insects, my curiosity has disturbed your housekeeping. But you\r\nwere only starting, you were having your house-warming, so to speak.\r\nPerhaps you may be able to make good the damage which I have wrought.\r\nLet us try. I will restore the condition of the establishment by\r\nsupplying fresh provisions. It is for you now to dig new burrows, to\r\ncarry down the wherewithal to replace the cake of which I have robbed\r\nyou, and afterwards to divide the lump, improved by time, into rations\r\nsuited to the needs of your larvæ. Will you do all this? I hope so.\r\n\r\nMy faith in the perseverance of the sorely-tried couples is not\r\ndisappointed. A month later, in the middle of July, I venture on a\r\nsecond inspection. The cellars have been rebuilt, as spacious as at\r\nfirst. Moreover, by this time they are padded with a soft lining of\r\ndung on the floor and on a part of the side-walls. The two sexes are\r\nstill there; they will not separate until the rearing is completed. The\r\nfather, who has less family-affection, or perhaps is more timid, tries\r\nto steal off by the back-way as the light enters the shattered\r\ndwelling; the mother, squatting on her precious pellets, does not\r\nbudge. These pellets are oval-shaped plums, very like those of the\r\nSpanish Copris, but not quite so large.\r\n\r\nKnowing how few compose the latter’s collection, I am greatly surprised\r\nat the sight that now meets my eyes. In a single cell I count seven or\r\neight ovoids, standing one against the other and lifting up their\r\nnippled tops, each with its hatching-chamber. Notwithstanding its size,\r\nthe hall is cram-full; there is hardly room left for the two guardians\r\nto move about. It may be compared with a bird’s nest containing its\r\neggs and no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nThe comparison is inevitable. What indeed are the Copris’ pills but\r\neggs of another sort, in which the nutritive mass of the white and the\r\nyolk is replaced by a pot of preserved foodstuffs? Here the\r\nDung-beetles rival the birds and even surpass them. Instead of\r\nproducing from within themselves, merely by the mysterious processes of\r\nnature, that which will provide for the latter growth of their young,\r\nthey are actively and openly industrious, and by dint of their own\r\nskill provide food for their grubs which will achieve the adult form\r\nwithout other assistance. They know nothing of the long and tortuous\r\nprocess of incubation; the sun is their incubator. They have not the\r\ncontinual worry of providing food, for they prepare this in advance and\r\nmake only one distribution. But they never leave the nest. Their watch\r\nis incessant. Father and mother, those vigilant guardians, do not quit\r\nthe house until the family is fit to sally forth.\r\n\r\nThe father’s usefulness is manifest so long as there is a house to dig\r\nand wealth to amass; it is less evident when the mother is cutting up\r\nher loaf into rations, shaping her ovoids, polishing them and watching\r\nover them. Can it be that the cavalier also takes part in this delicate\r\ntask, which would rather seem to be a feminine monopoly? Is he able,\r\nwith his sharp leg, to slice up the cake, to remove from it the\r\nrequisite quantity for a larva’s sustenance and to round the piece into\r\na sphere, thus shortening the work, which could be revised and\r\nperfected by the mother? Does he know the art of stopping up chinks, of\r\nrepairing breaches, of soldering slits, of scraping pellets and\r\nclearing them of any dangerous vegetable matter? Does he show the brood\r\nthe same attentions which the mother lavishes by herself in the burrows\r\nof the Spanish Copris? Here the two sexes are together. Do they both\r\ntake part in bringing up the family?\r\n\r\nI tried to obtain an answer by installing a couple of Lunary Copres in\r\na glass jar screened by a cardboard sheath, which enabled me readily\r\nand quickly to produce light or darkness. When suddenly surprised, the\r\nmale was perched upon the pellets almost as often as the female; but,\r\nwhereas the mother would frequently go on with her ticklish\r\nnursery-work, polishing the pellets with the flat of her leg and\r\nfeeling and sounding them, the father, more cowardly and less engrossed\r\nin his duties, would drop down as soon as the daylight was admitted and\r\nrun away to hide in some corner of the heap. There is no way of seeing\r\nhim at work, so quick is he to shun the unwelcome light.\r\n\r\nStill, though he refused to display his talents on my behalf, his very\r\npresence on the top of the ovoids betrays them. Not for nothing was he\r\nin that uncomfortable attitude, so ill-adapted to an idler’s slumbers.\r\nHe was then watching like his companion, touching up the damaged parts,\r\nlistening through the walls of the shells to find out how the\r\nyoungsters were progressing. The little that I saw assures me that the\r\nfather almost rivals the mother in domestic solicitude until the family\r\nis finally emancipated.\r\n\r\nThe offspring gain in numbers by this paternal devotion. In the Spanish\r\nCopris’ mansion, where the mother alone resides, we find four\r\nnurselings at most, often two or three, sometimes only one. In that of\r\nthe Lunary Copris, where the two sexes cohabit and help each other, we\r\ncount as many as eight, twice the largest population of the other. The\r\nhard-working father enjoys a magnificent proof of his influence upon\r\nthe fate of the household.\r\n\r\nApart from labour in common, this prosperity demands another condition\r\nwithout which the zeal of the couple would be ineffectual. Before\r\neverything, if you want a big family you must have enough to feed it\r\non. Remember the victualling methods of the Copris-tribe generally.\r\nThey do not, like the pill-rollers, go gathering here and there a booty\r\nwhich is rounded into a ball and subsequently rolled to the burrow;\r\nthey settle immediately underneath the heap which they find, and there,\r\nwithout leaving the threshold of the house, carve themselves slices\r\nwhich they carry down singly to their store until they have collected\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Copris, at least in my neighbourhood, handles the product\r\nof the Sheep. It is of high quality, but not plentiful, even when the\r\npurveyor’s intestines are in their most generous mood. The whole of it,\r\ntherefore, is packed into the cavern and the insect does not come out\r\nagain, being kept underground by family-cares, even though there be but\r\none youngster to attend to. The niggardly morsel as a rule supplies\r\nmaterial only for two or three larvæ. Consequently the family is a\r\nsmall one, through the difficulty in procuring provisions.\r\n\r\nThe Lunary Copris works under different conditions. His part of the\r\ncountry provides the Cow-clap, that rich patch of dung in which the\r\ninsect finds inexhaustible supplies of the food needed by a flourishing\r\noffspring. This prosperity is assisted by the size of the abode, whose\r\nceiling, with its exceptional breadth, is able to shelter a number of\r\npills that would never fit into the Spanish Copris’ much less roomy\r\nburrow.\r\n\r\nFor lack of space at home and of a well-furnished flour-bin, the latter\r\nrestricts the number of her children, which is sometimes reduced to\r\none. Can this be due to impotence of the ovaries? No. I have shown in\r\nan earlier chapter that, given free scope and a well-spread table, the\r\nmother is capable of producing twice her usual family and more. I\r\ndescribed how for the three or four ovoids I substituted a loaf kneaded\r\nwith my paper-knife. By means of this artifice, which increased the\r\nspace in the narrow enclosure of the jar and provided fresh materials\r\nfor modelling, I obtained from the mother a family of seven in all. It\r\nwas a magnificent result, but far inferior to that derived from the\r\nfollowing experiment, which was better managed.\r\n\r\nThis time I take away the pellets as they are formed, all but one, so\r\nas not to discourage the mother by my kidnapping. If she found nothing\r\nat all left of her previous products, she might perhaps weary of her\r\nfruitless labour. When the main loaf, of her constructing, has all been\r\nused, I replace it with another, made by myself. I go on doing this,\r\nremoving the ovoid that has just been completed and renewing the\r\nfinished lump of food until the insect refuses to accept any more. For\r\nfive or six weeks the sorely tried mother never loses her patience and\r\neach time begins all over again and perseveringly restocks her empty\r\nnursery. At last the dog-days arrive, the brutal season which arrests\r\nall life by its excessive heat and dryness. My loaves, however\r\ncarefully made, are scorned. The mother, overcome with torpor, refuses\r\nto work. She buries herself in the sand, at the foot of the last\r\npellet, and there, motionless, awaits the liberating September rain.\r\nThe indefatigable creature has bequeathed me thirteen ovoids, each\r\nmodelled to perfection, each supplied with an egg; thirteen, a number\r\nunparalleled in the Copris’ annals; thirteen, ten more than the normal\r\nlaying.\r\n\r\nThe proof is established: if the horned Dung-beetle strictly limits her\r\nfamily, it is not through penury of the ovaries, but through fear of\r\nfamine.\r\n\r\nIs it not thus that things happen in our country, which, the\r\nstatisticians tell us, is threatened with depopulation? The clerk, the\r\nartisan, the civil servant, the workman, the small shopkeeper are a\r\ndaily increasing multitude with us; and all of them, having hardly\r\nenough to live upon, refrain as far as possible from adding to the\r\nnumbers gathered around their ill-furnished table. When bread is short,\r\nthe Copris is not wrong in becoming almost a celibate. Why should we\r\ncast a stone at his imitators? The motive is one of prudence on either\r\nside. It is better to live alone than surrounded by hungry mouths. The\r\nman who feels strong enough to struggle with poverty for himself\r\nshrinks in dismay from the poverty of a crowded home.\r\n\r\nIn the good old days, the tiller of the soil, the peasant, the backbone\r\nof the nation, found that a numerous family added to his wealth. All\r\nused to work and bring their bit of bread to the frugal repast. While\r\nthe eldest drove the team afield, the youngest, clad in his first pair\r\nof breeches, took the brood of Ducklings to the pond. [55]\r\n\r\nThese patriarchal ways are becoming rare. Progress sees to that. Of\r\ncourse, it is an enviable thing to scorch along on a bicycle, working\r\nyour legs up and down like a distracted Spider; but there is a reverse\r\nto the medal: progress brings luxury, but creates expensive tastes. In\r\nmy village, the commonest factory-girl, earning her ten-pence a day,\r\nsports on a Sunday sleeves puffed at the shoulders and feathers in her\r\nhat like the fine ladies’; she has a sunshade with an ivory handle, a\r\npadded chignon, patent-leather shoes, with open-work stockings and lace\r\nflounces. O Goose-girl, I in my short linen jacket dare not look at you\r\nas you pass my door on your Sunday parade along the high-road! You make\r\nme feel too small with your smart raiment.\r\n\r\nThe young men, on the other hand, are assiduous frequenters of the\r\ncafé, which is much more luxurious than the old-fashioned pot-house.\r\nHere they find vermouth, bitters, absinthe, amer Picon, in short the\r\nwhole collection of stupefying drugs. Such tastes as these make the\r\nfields seem too humble and the soil too stubborn. Since the receipts no\r\nlonger come up to the expenses, they leave the land for the town, which\r\nis better-suited, so they imagine, for money-making. Alas, saving is no\r\nmore practicable there than here! The workshop, where opportunities of\r\nspending money lie in wait by the score, makes a man no richer than the\r\nplough. But it is too late: you have made your bed; and you remain a\r\npoverty-stricken townsman, in terror of paternity.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this country, with its glorious climate, fertility, and\r\ngeographical position, is invaded by a host of cosmopolitans, sharks\r\nand sharpers of every sort. Long ago, it used to attract the sea-roving\r\nPhœnicians; the peace-loving Greeks, who brought us the alphabet, the\r\nvine and the olive-tree; the Romans, those harsh rulers, who handed\r\ndown to us barbarities very difficult to eradicate. Swooping on this\r\nrich prey came the Cymri, the Teutons, the Vandals, the Goths, the\r\nHuns, the Burgundians, the Suevi, the Alani, the Franks, the Saracens,\r\nhordes driven hither by every wind that blows. And all this\r\nheterogeneous mixture was melted down and absorbed by the Gallic\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nTo-day the foreigner is stealthily making his way into our midst. We\r\nare threatened with a second barbarian invasion, peaceful, it is true,\r\nbut yet disturbing. Will our language, so clear and so harmonious,\r\nbecome an obscure jargon, harsh with exotic gutturals? Will our\r\ngenerous character be dishonoured by rapacious hucksters? Will the land\r\nof our fathers cease to be a country and become a caravanserai? There\r\nis a fear of it, unless the old Gallic blood runs swift and strong once\r\nmore and engulfs the stream of invaders.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that it may be so and let us listen to what the horned\r\nDung-beetle has to teach us. A large family demands food. But progress\r\nbrings new needs, which cost much to satisfy; and our revenues are far\r\nfrom increasing at the same rate. When men have not enough for six or\r\nfive or four, they are content to live as a family of three or two, or\r\neven to remain single. Guided by such principles as these, a nation, in\r\nits successive stages of progress, is on the road to suicide.\r\n\r\nLet us go back then to where we were, suppress our artificial needs,\r\nthose unwholesome fruits of a hot-house civilization, honour rustic\r\nfrugality once again and remain on the land, where we shall find the\r\nsoil bountiful enough to satisfy us if we moderate our desires. Then\r\nand not till then will the family flourish once more; then will the\r\npeasant, delivered from the town and its temptations, be our salvation.\r\n\r\nThe third Dung-beetle that has shown me the gift of paternal instinct\r\nis likewise a stranger. He comes to me from near Montpellier. He is the\r\nBison Onitis, or, according to others, the Bison Bubas. Taking no\r\ninterest in nomenclature subtleties, I shall not choose between the two\r\ngeneric names, but will retain the specific denomination of Bison,\r\nwhich has the sound which Linnæus wanted. I made his acquaintance many\r\nyears ago in the country around Ajaccio, [56] among the saffrons and\r\ncyclamens that bloom so sweetly under the shade of the myrtles. Come\r\nhither and let me admire you yet once again, O beauteous insect! You\r\nrecall my youthful enthusiasm on the shores of the glorious gulf, so\r\nrich in shell-fish. Far was I from suspecting at the time that it would\r\none day fall to my share to sing your praises! I have not seen you\r\nsince. Welcome to my vivarium! And now tell us something about\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nYou are a sturdy little chap, short-legged and packed into a solid\r\nrectangle, a sign of strength. On your head you wear two abbreviated\r\nhorns, curved like a Steer’s; and you prolong your corselet into a\r\nblunt forehead adorned with two pretty dimples, one on the right and\r\none on the left. Your general appearance and your male finery make you\r\na near neighbour of the coprinary group. The entomologists, in fact,\r\nclass you immediately after the Copres and a long way from the\r\nGeotrupes. Does your trade tally with the place which the systematists\r\nallot to you? What can you do?\r\n\r\nIn common with others, I admire the classifier who, studying the mouth,\r\nthe legs and the antennæ in the dead insect, is sometimes happy in his\r\ngrouping and able, for instance, to include in the same family the\r\nScarab and the Sisyphus, who differ so greatly in appearance and so\r\nlittle in habits. Yet this method, which ignores the higher\r\nmanifestations of life in order to pore over the smallest details of\r\nthe corpse, too often misleads us as to the insect’s real talent, which\r\nis a much more important characteristic than a joint more or less in\r\nthe antennæ. The Bison, like many others, warns us to be careful where\r\nwe are going. Though akin to the Copris in structure, he is much nearer\r\nthe Geotrupes in his industry. Like them, he packs sausages in a\r\ncylindrical mould; like them again, he has the paternal instinct.\r\n\r\nI inspect my one couple in the middle of June. Under a plentiful pile\r\nprovided by the Sheep is a perpendicular shaft a finger’s-breadth in\r\ndiameter, open freely throughout its length and running some nine\r\ninches down. The bottom of this well branches out into five different\r\ngalleries, each occupied by a roly-poly pudding similar to the\r\nGeotrupes’, but less bulky and not so long. The mass of fodder has a\r\nwarty surface, is rounded off clumsily and has a hatching-chamber\r\nscooped out of it at the lower end. This chamber is a little round\r\ncell, coated with a semifluid wash. The egg is oval, white and\r\ncomparatively large, as is the rule among Dung-beetles. In short, the\r\nBison’s rustic work is a very close reproduction of the Geotrupes’.\r\n\r\nI am disappointed: I expected better things. The insect’s elegance\r\nseemed to promise something more artistic, a finer craftsmanship,\r\nskilled in the modelling of pears, gourds, balls and ovoids. Once\r\nagain, be careful how you judge animals, any more than men, by\r\nappearances. The structure gives us no idea of the insect’s all-round\r\nability.\r\n\r\nI surprise the couple at the cross-roads where the five blind-alleys,\r\nthe sausages, start. The intrusion of the light has frightened them\r\ninto immobility. Before the disturbance caused by my excavations, what\r\nwere the two faithful partners doing at this spot? They were watching\r\nover the five cells, ramming down the last column of provisions,\r\ncompleting it with new contributions of material, brought down from\r\nabove and taken from the heap that forms a cover to the shaft. They\r\nwere perhaps preparing to dig a sixth chamber, if not more, and to\r\nstock it like the others. I realize at any rate that there must be many\r\nascents from the bottom of the pit to the rich warehouse on the\r\nsurface, whence the bundles of material are carried down in the legs of\r\nthe one to be methodically pressed on top of the egg by the other.\r\n\r\nThe shaft indeed is open throughout its length. Moreover, to prevent\r\nthe crumbling of the walls which would result from frequent journeys,\r\nthe sides are plastered with stucco from end to end. This coat is made\r\nof the same material as the puddings and is more than a twenty-fifth of\r\nan inch thick. It is continuous and fairly even, without having too\r\nelaborate a finish. It keeps the surrounding earth in place, so much so\r\nthat big fragments of the tunnel can be removed without losing their\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nIn the hamlets on the Alps, the south fronts of the buildings are\r\ncoated with Cow-dung, which, after drying in the summer sun, becomes\r\nthe winter fuel. The Bison knows this pastoral method, but practises it\r\nwith another object: he hangs his house with manure to keep it from\r\ncrumbling. The father might well be entrusted with this work in the\r\nintervals of rest which the mother leaves him while she is busy in the\r\nticklish work of making her pudding layer by layer. The Geotrupes, by\r\nway of yet another industrial resemblance, has already shown us a\r\nsimilar consolidating plaster. Hers, it is true, is less regular and\r\nless complete.\r\n\r\nAfter being ousted by my curiosity, the Bison couple set to work again\r\nand, by the middle of July, supplied me with three more puddings,\r\nmaking a total of eight. This time I find my two captives dead, one on\r\nthe surface, the other in the ground. Can it be an accident? Or is it\r\nnot more likely that the Bison constitutes an exception to the\r\nlongevity of the Scarabs, Copres and others, who behold their offspring\r\nand even fly away to their second wedding in the following spring?\r\n\r\nI incline to the belief that we come back here to the general insect\r\nlaw of a short life deprived of the chief joy of parenthood, the sight\r\nof one’s children, for no regrettable incident happened, so far as I\r\nknow, in the vivarium. If I am right in my conjectures, why does the\r\nBison, though a near kinsman of the Copris, who attains a green old\r\nage, die so quickly, like the common herd, once the future of his\r\nfamily is assured? Here again we have an unsolved mystery.\r\n\r\nA rapid sketch of the larva is preferable to long descriptions of its\r\njaws and palpi, which make dull reading. I shall have said enough, I\r\nthink, on the subject if I mention that it is bent into a crook, that\r\nit carries a knapsack on its back, that it is a quick evacuator and\r\nthat it is clever at stopping up any cracks in the dwelling:\r\ncharacteristics and talents which are a general rule among the\r\nDung-beetles. In August, when the pudding has been consumed in the\r\nmiddle and has become something of a ruin, the grub retires to the\r\nlower end and here isolates itself from the remainder of the cavity by\r\nmeans of a spherical enclosure, of which the mortar-bag supplies the\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe work, a graceful sphere about the size of a large cherry, is a\r\nmasterpiece of stercoral architecture and may be compared with that\r\nwhich the Bull Onthophagus has already shown us. Little nodes, arranged\r\nin concentric lines and alternating like the tiles of a roof, adorn the\r\nobject from pole to pole. Each of them must correspond with a stroke of\r\nthe trowel putting its load of mortar in place. If you did not know\r\nwhat it was, you would take the thing for the chiselled kernel of some\r\ntropical fruit. A sort of rough pericarp completes the illusion. It is\r\nthe rind of the pudding which surrounds the central jewel but is easily\r\nremoved, just as the husk separates from the nut. When we have done the\r\nshelling, we are quite surprised to find this splendid kernel under its\r\nrustic wrapper.\r\n\r\nSuch is the chamber built with a view to the metamorphosis. The larva\r\nspends the winter there in a state of torpor. I hoped to obtain the\r\nadult insect in the spring. To my great surprise, the larval stage\r\ncontinued until the end of July. It takes about a year, therefore, for\r\nthe nymph to make its appearance.\r\n\r\nThis slowness in maturing surprises me. Can it be the rule in the open\r\nfields? I think so, for in the confinement of my insect-house nothing\r\nhappened, to my knowledge, that would occasion this delay. I therefore\r\nenter the result of my manœuvres without any fear of making a mistake:\r\nlying lifeless in its elegant and solid casket, the larva of the Bison\r\nOnitis takes twelve months to develop into a nymph, whereas those of\r\nthe other Dung-beetles effect their transformation in a few weeks. As\r\nto stating or even suspecting the cause of this strange larval\r\nlongevity, these are points which must be left in the limbo of the\r\nunexplained.\r\n\r\nSoftened by the September rains, the stercoral shell, until now as hard\r\nas a plum-stone, yields to the hermit’s thrust; and the adult Beetle\r\ncomes up into the light of day to lead a life of revelry so long as the\r\nmild atmosphere of the last days of summer permits. When the first cold\r\nweather sets in, he retires to his winter quarters underground and\r\nreappears in the spring to begin the cycle of life all over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE BULL ONTHOPHAGUS: THE CELL\r\n\r\n\r\nBegun to-day and dropped to-morrow, taken up again later and again\r\nabandoned, according to the chances of the day, the study of instinct\r\nmakes but halting progress. The changing seasons bring unwelcome\r\ndelays, forcing the observer to wait till the following year or even\r\nlonger for the answer to his eager questions. Moreover, the problem\r\noften crops up unexpectedly, as the result of some casual incident of\r\nslight interest in itself, and it comes in a form so vague that it\r\ngives little basis for precise investigation. How can one investigate\r\nwhat has not yet been suspected? We have no facts to go upon and are\r\nconsequently unable to tackle the problem frankly.\r\n\r\nTo collect these facts by fragments, to subject those fragments to\r\nvaried tests in order to try their value, to make them into a sheaf of\r\nrays lighting up the darkness of the unknown and gradually causing it\r\nto emerge: all this demands a long space of time, especially as the\r\nfavourable periods are brief. Years elapse; and then very often the\r\nperfect solution has not appeared. There are always gaps in our sheaf\r\nof light; and always behind the mysteries which the rays have\r\npenetrated stand others, still shrouded in darkness.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly aware that it would be preferable to avoid repetitions\r\nand to give a complete story every time; but, in the domain of\r\ninstinct, who can claim a harvest that leaves no grain for other\r\ngleaners? Sometimes the handful of corn left on the field is of more\r\nimportance than the reaper’s sheaves. If we had to wait until we knew\r\nevery detail of the question studied, no one would venture to write the\r\nlittle that he knows. From time to time, a few truths are revealed,\r\ntiny pieces of the vast mosaic of things. Better to divulge the\r\ndiscovery, however humble it be. Others will come who, also gathering a\r\nfew fragments, will assemble the whole into a picture ever growing\r\nlarger but ever notched by the unknown.\r\n\r\nAnd then the burden of years forbids me to entertain long hopes.\r\nDistrustful of the morrow, I write from day to day, as I make my\r\nobservations. This method, one of necessity rather than choice,\r\nsometimes results in the reopening of old subjects, when new\r\ninvestigations throw light within and enable me to complete or it may\r\nbe to modify the first text.\r\n\r\nYears ago, I obtained a few noteworthy particulars about the\r\nOnthophagi, thanks to a very rough and ready method of rearing a few of\r\nthem jumbled up with other Beetles in whom I was more interested. One\r\nof the earlier volumes gives a rapid sketch of them. [57] The results,\r\nhurriedly and almost fortuitously acquired, inspired me with a wish to\r\nobserve systematically and closely the habits, industry and development\r\nof an insect which I had already introduced to the reader in too\r\nsummary a fashion. Let us speak once more of the Onthophagi, that\r\nnation of little horned dung-worshippers.\r\n\r\nLately, I have reared the following species, according as I chanced to\r\npick them up: Onthophagus taurus, Linn., O. vacca, Linn., O furcatus,\r\nFabr., O. Schreberi, Linn., O. nuchicornis, Linn., O. lemur, Fabr.\r\nThere has been no choice on my part; I accept all that present\r\nthemselves in sufficient numbers. The first especially abound. I am\r\ndelighted, for the Bull Onthophagus is the chief of the clan. There is\r\nnone to equal him, if not in dress, for this may be a richer copper in\r\nthe others, at least in the handsome horns which are the masculine\r\nprerogative. He will be the object of special attention in my\r\nmenagerie. For the rest, as what he teaches me is repeated elsewhere\r\nwithout noteworthy variations, his history will be that of the whole\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nI capture him, as well as the others, in the course of May. At this\r\nperiod of genetic awakening, I find them swarming very busily under the\r\nSheep-droppings, not those which are moulded into olives and scattered\r\nin trails, but those which are ejected in slabs of some size. The first\r\nare too dry and too scanty and the Onthophagus thinks nothing of them;\r\nthe second are goodly messes and he works them in preference to any\r\nother material.\r\n\r\nThe Mule’s copious heap is also largely utilized; but it is very\r\nstringy and, though the Beetle finds plenty in it for his own feasts,\r\nhe very seldom uses it for his offspring. Where the nests are\r\nconcerned, the Sheep is the main purveyor. Her exceptionally plastic\r\nproduct at once attracts the custom of the Onthophagi, who are just as\r\ndainty epicures as the Sacred Beetle, the Copris or the Sisyphus. If,\r\nhowever, the ovine pottage be lacking, they fall back upon the coarser\r\nlump of the Mule, with the aid of a scrupulous selection.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty about bringing up Onthophagi. A spacious\r\nvivarium that lends itself to frolicsome sports is not necessary here;\r\nit would even be inconvenient and would not favour close observation,\r\nbecause of the tumult prevailing in a numerous and varied crowd. I\r\nprefer a number of separate establishments, simpler and smaller, which\r\nI can carry into my private workroom. They will lend themselves better\r\nto assiduous inspection, without putting me to the trouble of digging.\r\nWhat receptacles shall I choose?\r\n\r\nThere are certain glass pots fitted with a tin lid which you screw over\r\ntheir mouths. They are used for honey, preserved fruits, jam, jelly and\r\nsimilar products dear to the heart of materfamilias when the winter\r\nscarcity sets in. I procure a dozen of these by clearing the cupboard\r\nin which the preserves are kept. They hold, on the average, about a\r\npint and three-quarters.\r\n\r\nHalf-filled with fresh sand and supplied in addition with provisions\r\nobtained from the Sheep’s pastry-shop, each jar receives its share of\r\nOnthophagi, of separate species and with both sexes present. When the\r\nglass houses are used up and the population becomes too dense, I resort\r\nto ordinary flower-pots, furnished according to rule and closed with a\r\npane of glass. The whole collection is arranged on my large\r\nlaboratory-table. My captives are satisfied with their installation,\r\nwhich provides them with a mild temperature, a nicely-shaded light and\r\nfirst-class fare.\r\n\r\nWhat more is needed to complete the Dung-beetles’ happiness? Nothing\r\nbut the raptures of pairing. They indulge in these freely. Interned in\r\nthe second half of May, with not a thought to the new state of things\r\nwhich puts a stop to their frolics among the thyme, eagerly they seek\r\none another out, make their overtures and group themselves in couples.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent occasion to find the reply to a primary question:\r\ndo the Onthophagus father and mother work in conjunction when looking\r\nafter the brood; have they a permanent household, similar to that which\r\nwe have seen in the Geotrupes, the Sisyphus and the Minotaur; [58] or\r\nis the mating followed by a sudden and definite rupture? The Bull\r\nOnthophagus shall tell us.\r\n\r\nI delicately transfer two insects in the act of coupling and establish\r\nthem in another, separate jar, provided with victuals and fresh sand.\r\nThe moving is performed safely; the entwined pair remain united. A\r\nquarter of an hour afterwards, they separate; the great job is\r\nfinished. The food is close at hand. They refresh themselves for a\r\nmoment; and then each, without bothering in the least about the other,\r\ndigs his burrow and buries himself in solitude.\r\n\r\nA week or so passes. The male reappears on the surface; he is restless,\r\nhe makes desperate efforts to climb out; the relations are done, quite\r\ndone; he wants to get away. By and by, the female comes up in her turn;\r\nshe tries the nearest cake, picks the best of it and takes it\r\nunderground. She is building her nest. As to her companion, he does not\r\neven notice what is happening: these things do not concern him.\r\n\r\nThe other captives, of no matter what species, when consulted in the\r\nsame manner, give the same reply. The Onthophagus tribe knows nothing\r\nof household ties.\r\n\r\nIn what respect are those who know them and who observe them so\r\nfaithfully any the better off? I do not quite see; or, to be more\r\ncandid, I do not see at all. If, in the case of the Geotrupes, I see in\r\nthe bulky pudding some slight excuse for the collaboration of the\r\nfather, who is a valuable assistant in the fabrication of this kind of\r\npreserve, and if, in that of the Minotaur, the immensely deep well\r\nmight suggest to me the need for the trident-wearing helper, who shoots\r\nout the rubbish while the mother goes on digging, I should still be\r\nwithout an explanation when I came to the Sisyphus, who is very\r\neconomical both in provisions and in the labour of excavation and\r\nrequires no help with either. I will not deny that, in this last case,\r\nthe male is of some use, watching over the pill, lending occasional\r\nhelp and encouraging the female with his presence; but, after all, the\r\npart which he plays as a collaborator is a very secondary one, and the\r\nmother, one would say, could do without any assistance, as is the rule\r\namong the Scarabæi. Here, besides, we have the Bull Onthophagus, who is\r\neven smaller than the Sisyphus; and this dwarf, unacquainted with a\r\npartnership that would increase her powers twofold, fulfils a task\r\nwhich is almost equivalent to that of the Beetles who roll their pills\r\nin double harness.\r\n\r\nThen how are talents and industries distributed? If we go on\r\naccumulating fact upon fact, observation upon observation, shall we\r\never come to know? I venture to doubt it.\r\n\r\nI have friends who sometimes say to me:\r\n\r\n‘Now that you have collected such a mass of details, you ought to\r\nfollow up analysis with synthesis and promulgate a comprehensive theory\r\nof the origin of instincts.’\r\n\r\nThere’s a rash proposal for you! Because I have turned over a few\r\ngrains of sand on the seashore, am I qualified to talk about the ocean\r\ndepths? Life has its unfathomable secrets. Human knowledge will be\r\nstruck off the world’s records before we know all that is to be said\r\nabout a Gnat.\r\n\r\nEqually obscure is the question of nest-building. By a nest we\r\nunderstand any residence constructed purposely to receive the eggs and\r\nto protect the development of the young. The Bees and Wasps excel in\r\nthe art. They know how to make cabins out of cotton-stuffs, wax, leaves\r\nor resin; they build turrets of clay and domes of masonry; they mould\r\nearthenware urns. The Spiders vie with them. Remember the\r\nflying-machines, the rose-patterned paraboloids of certain Epeiræ; the\r\nglobular bag of the Lycosa; the Labyrinth Spider’s cloisters with their\r\nGothic arches; the Clotho Spider’s tent and lentiform pockets. [59]\r\n\r\nThe Locust makes pits surmounted by a frothy chimney; the Mantis whips\r\nher glair into a frothy mass. [60] The Fly and the Butterfly, on the\r\nother hand, know nothing of these fond attentions: they limit\r\nthemselves to laying their eggs at spots where the young can find board\r\nand lodging for themselves. [61] The Beetle also is generally extremely\r\nignorant of the finer points of nest-building. By a very singular\r\nexception, the Dung-beetles, alone among the immense host of wearers of\r\narmoured wing-cases, have a special art of rearing, a system of\r\nupbringing which can bear comparison with that of the most gifted\r\ninsects. How did they come by this industry?\r\n\r\nVenturesome minds, deluded by the greatly daring theorists, tell us\r\nthat the science of the future, rich in evidence drawn from the\r\nmysteries of fibre and cell, will draw up an affiliation-table in which\r\nthe animal kingdom will be classified so that the place occupied by a\r\ncreature shall inform us of its instincts, without any need of\r\npreliminary observation. We shall determine the aptitudes by means of\r\nlearned formulæ, even as numbers are determined by their logarithms. It\r\nis most impressive; but beware: we are dealing with Dung-beetles; let\r\nus consult them before we draw up the logarithmic table of instincts.\r\nThe Onthophagus is related to the Copris, the Scarab and the Sisyphus,\r\nall of whom are versed in the art of making shapely pellets. Let us try\r\nto tell beforehand, according to the place which she occupies in the\r\ninsect-table, going merely by the formula, what she is able to do in\r\nthe way of nest-building.\r\n\r\nShe is small, I agree; but littleness does not diminish talent in the\r\nleast, as witness the Titmouse, with his pendulous nest, the Wren and\r\nthe Canary, who, although among the smallest of our little birds, are\r\nincomparable artists. The near kinswomen of the Onthophagus excel in\r\nmaking beautiful ovoids and pear-shaped gourds. She herself, so tiny\r\nand so precise, ought to do even better.\r\n\r\nWell, the table deceives us, the formula lies: the Onthophagus is a\r\nvery indifferent artist; her nest is a rudimentary piece of work,\r\nhardly fit to be acknowledged. I obtain it in profusion from the six\r\nspecies which I have brought up in my jars and flower-pots. The Bull\r\nOnthophagus alone provides me with nearly a hundred; and I find no two\r\nprecisely alike, as pieces should be that come from the same mould and\r\nthe same workshop.\r\n\r\nTo this lack of exact similarity, we must add inaccuracy of shape, now\r\nmore now less accentuated. It is easy, however, to recognize among the\r\nbulk the pattern upon which the clumsy nest-builder works. It is a sack\r\nshaped like a thimble and standing erect, with the spherical\r\nthimble-end at the bottom and the circular opening at the top.\r\n\r\nSometimes the insect establishes itself in the central region of my\r\napparatus, in the heart of the earthy mass; then, the resistance being\r\nthe same in every direction, the sack-like shape is pretty accurate.\r\nBut, generally, the Onthophagus prefers a solid basis to a dusty\r\nsupport and builds on the walls of the jar, especially on the bottom.\r\nWhen the support is vertical, the sack is a longitudinal section of a\r\nshort cylinder, with the smooth flat surface against the glass and a\r\nrugged convexity every elsewhere. If the support be horizontal, as is\r\nmost frequently the case, the cabin is a sort of undecided oval\r\nlozenge, flat at the bottom, bulging and vaulted at the top. To the\r\ngeneral inaccuracy of these contorted shapes, regulated by no very\r\ndefinite pattern, we must add the coarseness of the surfaces, all of\r\nwhich, with the exception of the parts touching the glass, are covered\r\nwith a crust of sand.\r\n\r\nThe manner of procedure explains this uncouth exterior. As laying-time\r\ndraws nigh, the Onthophagus bores a cylindrical pit and descends\r\nunderground to a moderate depth. Here, working with her forehead, her\r\nchin and her fore-legs, which are toothed like a rake, she forces back\r\nand heaps around her the materials which she has moved, so as to obtain\r\nas best she may a nest of suitable size.\r\n\r\nThe next thing is to cement the crumbling walls of the cavity. The\r\ninsect climbs back to the surface by way of its pit; it gathers on its\r\nthreshold an armful of mortar taken from the cake whereunder it has\r\nelected to set up house; it goes down again with its burden, which it\r\nspreads and presses upon the sandy wall. Thus it produces a concrete\r\ncasing, the gravel of which is supplied by the wall itself and the\r\ncement by the produce of the Sheep. After a few trips and repeated\r\nstrokes of the trowel, the pit is plastered on every side; the walls,\r\nencrusted all over with grains of sand, are no longer liable to give\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe cabin is ready: it now wants only a tenant and stores. First, a\r\nlarge free space is made at the bottom: the hatching-chamber, where the\r\negg is laid on the wall. Next comes the collecting of the provisions\r\nintended for the grub, a collecting done with scrupulous care.\r\nRecently, when building, the insect worked upon the outside of the\r\ndoughy mass and took no notice of the earthy blemishes. Now, it\r\npenetrates to the very centre of the lump, through a gallery that looks\r\nas though it were made with a punch. When trying a cheese, the buyer\r\nemploys a scoop, the hollow, cylindrical taster which is driven well in\r\nand pulled out with a sample taken from the middle of the cheese. The\r\nOnthophagus, when collecting for her grub, goes to work as though\r\nequipped with one of these tasters. She bores an exactly round hole\r\ninto the piece which she is exploiting; she goes straight to the\r\nmiddle, where the material, not being exposed to the contact of the\r\nair, has kept more savoury and pliable. Here and here alone are\r\ngathered the armfuls which, gradually stowed away, kneaded and heaped\r\nup to the requisite extent, fill the sack to the top. Lastly, a plug of\r\nthe same mortar, the sides of which are made partly of sand and partly\r\nof stercoral cement, roughly closes the cell, in such a way that an\r\nexternal inspection does not allow one to distinguish front from back.\r\n\r\nTo judge of the work and its merit, we must open it. A large empty\r\nspace, oval in shape, occupies the rear end. This is the birth-chamber,\r\nhuge in dimensions compared with its contents, the egg fixed on the\r\nwall, sometimes at the bottom of the cell and sometimes on the side.\r\nThis egg is a tiny white cylinder, rounded at each tip and measuring a\r\nmillimetre [62] in length immediately after it is laid. With no other\r\nsupport than the spot on which the oviduct has planted it, it stands on\r\nits hinder end and projects into space.\r\n\r\nA more or less enquiring glance is quite surprised to find so small a\r\ngerm contained in so large a box. What does the tiny egg want with all\r\nthat room? When carefully examined within, the walls of the chamber\r\nsuggest another question. They are coated with a fine greenish pap,\r\nsemifluid and shiny, the appearance of which does not agree with either\r\nthe external or the internal aspect of the lump from which the insect\r\nhas extracted its materials. A similar lime-wash is observed in the\r\nnest which the Scarab, the Copris, the Sisyphus, the Geotrupes and\r\nother makers of stercoraceous preserves contrive in the very heart of\r\nthe provisions, to receive the egg; but nowhere have I seen it so\r\nplentiful, in proportion, as in the hatching-chamber of the\r\nOnthophagus. Long puzzled by this brothy wash, of which the Sacred\r\nBeetle provided me with the first instance, I at one time took the\r\nthing for a layer of moisture oozing from the bulk of the victuals and\r\ncollecting on the surface of the enclosure without other effort than\r\ncapillary action. That was the interpretation of this varnish which I\r\naccepted in various earlier passages.\r\n\r\nI was wrong. The truth is something much more remarkable. To-day,\r\nbetter informed by the Onthophagus, I reopen the question: is this\r\nlime-wash, this semifluid cream, the result of a natural oozing, or is\r\nit the product of maternal foresight? A simple and conclusive\r\nexperiment will give us the answer. I ought to have made it at the\r\noutset. I did not think of it, because the simple is usually the last\r\nthing that we call to our aid. Here is the experiment.\r\n\r\nI pack a little glass jar, the size of a Hen’s egg, with Sheep-dung as\r\nemployed by the Onthophagus. With a glass rod, which leaves a perfectly\r\nsmooth impression, I make a cylindrical cavity in the heap about an\r\ninch deep. After withdrawing the rod, I cover the orifice with a slab\r\nof the same material; and I protect the whole against desiccation by\r\nmeans of an hermetically closed lid. It is the Sacred Beetle’s pear,\r\nwith its hatching-chamber, on a larger scale; it is the Onthophagus’\r\nthimble, enormously exaggerated. I may say that, after the withdrawal\r\nof the glass rod, the surface of the cavity is a dull, greenish black,\r\nwith not a trace of extravasated shiny moisture. If an oozing by\r\ncapillary action really takes place, the semifluid varnish will appear;\r\nif nothing of the kind should occur, the surface will remain dull.\r\n\r\nI wait a couple of days to allow the capillary sweating to take effect,\r\nif such a process there be. Then I examine the cavity. There is no\r\nshiny wash on the walls; they look as dull and dry as at the beginning.\r\nThree days later, I make a fresh inspection. Nothing has changed: the\r\npit made by the glass rod shows no sign of exudation; it is even a\r\nlittle drier. So capillary action and its extravasations have nothing\r\nto do with the matter.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the lime-wash that is found in every cell? The answer is\r\ninevitable: it is something produced by the mother, a special gruel, a\r\nmilk-food elaborated for the benefit of the new-born grub.\r\n\r\nThe young Pigeon puts his beak into that of his parents, who, with\r\nconvulsive efforts, force down his gullet first a casein mash secreted\r\nin the crop and later a broth of grains softened by being partly\r\ndigested. He is fed upon disgorged foods, which are kind to the frailty\r\nand inexperience of a young stomach. The grub of the Onthophagus is\r\nbrought up in much the same way, at the start. To assist its first\r\nattempts at swallowing, the mother prepares for it, in her crop, a\r\nlight and strengthening cream.\r\n\r\nTo pass the dainty from mouth to mouth is impossible in her case: the\r\nconstruction of new cells keeps her busy elsewhere. Moreover—and this\r\nis a more serious point—the laying takes place egg by egg, at very long\r\nintervals, and the hatching is pretty slow: time would fail, had the\r\nfamily to be brought up in the manner of the Pigeons. Another method is\r\nperforce required. The infants’ food is disgorged all over the walls of\r\nthe cabin, in such a way that the nurseling finds itself surrounded\r\nwith an abundance of bread and jam, in which the bread, the meat for\r\nthe strong, is represented by the uncooked material, as supplied by the\r\nSheep, while the jam, the food for the babe, is represented by the same\r\nmaterial daintily prepared beforehand in the mother’s stomach. We shall\r\nsee the grub presently lick first the jam all around it and then\r\nstoutly attack the bread. One of our own children would behave no\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nI should have liked to catch the mother in the act of disgorging and\r\nspreading her broth. I did not succeed in doing so. The proceedings\r\ntake place in a tiny niche; and the busy cook blocks out the view. Also\r\nher fluster at being exhibited in broad daylight at once arrests the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIf direct observation be lacking, at least the appearance of the\r\nmaterial and the result of my experiment with the glass rod speak very\r\nplainly and tell us that the Onthophagus, here rivalling the Pigeon,\r\nbut with a different method, disgorges the first mouthfuls for her\r\nsons. And the same may be said of the other Dung-beetles skilled in the\r\nart of building a hatching-chamber in the centre of the provisions.\r\n\r\nNo elsewhere in the insect world, except among the Bees, who prepare\r\ndisgorged food in the shape of honey, is such solicitude seen. The\r\ndung-workers edify us with their morals. Several of them practise\r\nassociation in couples and found a household; several anticipate the\r\nprocess of suckling, that supreme expression of maternal tenderness, by\r\nturning their crop into a nipple. Life has its freaks. It settles amid\r\nordure the creatures most highly endowed with domestic qualities. True,\r\nfrom there it mounts, with a sudden flight, to the sublime virtues of\r\nthe bird.\r\n\r\nAmong the Onthophagi the egg grows considerably larger after it is\r\nlaid; it almost doubles its linear dimensions, thus increasing the bulk\r\neightfold. This growth is general among the Dung-beetles. If you note\r\nthe size of an egg recently laid by any species and measure it again\r\nwhen the grub is about to be born, you will be quite surprised at the\r\nsingular progress which it has made. The Sacred Beetle’s egg, for\r\ninstance, which at first is lodged pretty spaciously in its\r\nhatching-chamber, swells until it nearly fills the cavity.\r\n\r\nThe first idea that occurs to the mind is a very simple and tempting\r\none, namely, that the egg feeds. Surrounded by strongly-flavoured\r\neffluvia, it becomes impregnated with emanations which distend its\r\nflexible tunic; it grows by a sort of alimentary respiration, just as a\r\nseed swells in fertile soil. That is how I pictured things at the\r\nbeginning, when the delicate problem presented itself for the first\r\ntime. But is this really what happens? Ah, if it were enough, when we\r\nwere in need of food, to stand outside a cook-shop and inhale the smell\r\nof the good things that were being prepared inside, what a different\r\nworld it would seem, to many of us! It would be too lovely!\r\n\r\nThe Onthophagus, the Copris and the other Beetles with cream-washed\r\nhatching-chambers are a delusion and a snare to us, with their eggs\r\nwhich are so ready to swell. The Minotaurus tells me so, somewhat late\r\nin the day; she compels me to reconsider my earlier interpretations\r\nentirely. Her egg is not enclosed in a hollow inside the victuals whose\r\nemanations might explain its growth; it is outside the sausage, a good\r\nway underneath, surrounded by sand on every side; and nevertheless it\r\nincreases in size just as well as those lodged in a succulent cabin.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the new-born grub surprises me by its chubbiness; it is seven\r\nor eight times as big as the egg whence it comes; the contents vastly\r\nexceed the capacity of the container. Besides, before touching the food\r\nfrom which it is separated by a ceiling of sand, the grub for a certain\r\ntime continues its strange growing, as though new materials were being\r\nadded to those which came out of the egg.\r\n\r\nHere, in the dry sand, it is impossible to talk of effluvia capable of\r\nproviding the wherewithal for the grub to wax big and fat. Then to what\r\ndo both the egg and the new-born grub owe their growth? The\r\nLanguedocian Scorpion [63] gives us an excellent clue. When passing\r\nfrom a sort of larval stage to the final form, which is the same as\r\nthat of the adult, we have seen him suddenly double his length and\r\nconsequently increase eightfold in bulk before taking the least scrap\r\nof nourishment. A highly complex process of co-ordination and\r\nadjustment takes place in the interior of the organism; and the\r\ndimensions increase without the addition of new material.\r\n\r\nAn animal is a structure capable of becoming more spacious with the\r\nsame amount of materials. Everything depends upon the molecular\r\narchitecture, which becomes more and more refined by the tremors of\r\nlife. The contents of the egg, a compact mass, expand into a creature\r\nwhich is all the bulkier for its richness in organs for diverse\r\nfunctions. Even so, the locomotive engine, the creature of industry,\r\noccupies more space than the iron, its raw material, melted down into a\r\nsingle ingot.\r\n\r\nWhen the shell is able to stretch, the egg swells under the thrust of\r\nits contents, which form into an organic whole and dilate. This is the\r\ncase with the various Dung-beetles. When the shell is hard and rigid, a\r\nvoid is made by evaporation at the thick end; and this excess of space\r\nsupplies the room necessary for the increase in volume of the contents.\r\nThis is the case with the birds, which develop within a chalky\r\nenclosure that does not alter in size. Both of them dilate, with this\r\ndifference that the soft shell allows the inside work to be perceived\r\noutside, whereas the stiff shell reveals nothing.\r\n\r\nLastly, the hatching does not always stop the growth that is not\r\npreceded by feeding. For a little while longer the larva continues to\r\nincrease in size; it completes the work of acquiring stability in its\r\nnew equilibrium, the equilibrium of a living creature; it improves its\r\nphysique by supplementary stretching. The Scorpion has already told us\r\nthis; the grub of the Minotaurus and many others assure us of the same\r\nthing. It is, on a smaller scale, what we saw before in the Locust’s\r\nwing, [64] which, issuing from a very small sheath, soon unfurls into a\r\nsail of generous breadth.\r\n\r\nTwice, therefore, am I changing my opinions in this history of the\r\nDung-beetles: first, on the subject of the paste spread on the walls of\r\nthe natal chamber; secondly, on the subject of the egg that increases\r\nin size after it is laid. I have corrected my statements without being\r\ngreatly ashamed of my mistakes, for it is difficult indeed to reach the\r\nvein of truth at the first tentative boring. There is only one means of\r\nnever blundering, which is never to do anything and, above all, to let\r\nideas alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE BULL ONTHOPHAGUS: THE LARVA; THE NYMPH\r\n\r\n\r\nMay is the nesting-month of the different Onthophagi and of the Bull\r\nOnthophagus in particular. The mothers now go underground to some\r\nlittle depth, under the shelter of the cave whence the building and\r\nvictualling-materials are extracted. Unaided by the males, who,\r\nheedless of family cares, continue to lead a life of jollity, they\r\nfashion their cabins and stuff them with provisions after the egg is\r\nlaid. The work, for that matter, is crude and elementary and hardly\r\nneeds the collaboration of the horned dandies. Five or six\r\nestablishments at most, each founded in a couple of days, represent the\r\nwhole of a mother’s work and leave plenty of time for spring revelry.\r\n\r\nThe grub is hatched in about a week; and a strange and paradoxical\r\nlittle creature it is. On its back it has an enormous sugar-loaf hump,\r\nthe weight of which overbalances it each time that it tries to stand on\r\nits legs and walk. At every moment it staggers and falls under the\r\nburden of the hunch. The Sacred Beetle’s larva showed us long ago a\r\nknapsack which was a storehouse of cement to stop up the accidental\r\ncracks in the provision-box and protect the food from drying too\r\nrapidly. The Onthophagus’ grub exaggerates a similar warehouse to the\r\nutmost degree; it makes a cone-shaped monument of it, so extravagant\r\nand grotesque as to border on caricature. Is it some mad masquerader’s\r\njoke or a rational deformity which will have its uses later? The future\r\nwill tell us.\r\n\r\nWithout saying anything more about it, for lack of words to give a\r\npicture of anything so extraordinary, I will refer the reader to the\r\ngrub of the Oniticellus, which I sketched in an earlier chapter. [65]\r\nThe two hunchbacks are very much alike.\r\n\r\nUnable to keep its hump upright, the grub of the Onthophagus lies down\r\non its side in the cell and licks the cream all around it. There is\r\ncream everywhere, on the ceiling, on the walls, on the floor. As soon\r\nas one spot is thoroughly bared, the consumer moves a little way on\r\nwith the help of its well-shaped legs; it capsizes again and starts\r\nlicking again. As the cabin is large and plentifully supplied, the\r\npatent-food diet lasts some time.\r\n\r\nThe fat babies of the Geotrupes, the Copris and the Sacred Beetle\r\nfinish at one brief sitting the dainty wherewith their narrow lodge is\r\nhung, a dainty frugally served and just sufficient to whet the appetite\r\nand prepare the stomach for coarser fare; but the Onthophagus’ grub,\r\nthat puny dwarf, has enough to last it for a week and more. The\r\nspacious birth-chamber, which is out of all proportion to the\r\nnurseling’s size, has permitted this wastefulness.\r\n\r\nAt last the real loaf is attacked. In about a month everything is\r\nconsumed, except the wall of the sack. And now the splendid part played\r\nby the hump stands revealed. Glass tubes, which I had got ready in\r\nanticipation, allow me to watch the grub at work. Growing plumper and\r\nplumper and more and more humpbacked, it withdraws to one end of the\r\ncell, which has become a crumbling ruin. Here it builds a casket in\r\nwhich the transformation will take place. Its materials are the\r\ndigestive residuum, converted into mortar and heaped up in the hump.\r\nThe stercoral architect is about to construct a masterpiece of elegance\r\nout of its own ordure, held in reserve in that receptacle.\r\n\r\nI follow its movements with the magnifying-glass. It curves itself into\r\na loop, closes the circuit of the digestive apparatus, brings its two\r\nends into contact and, with the tip of its mandibles, seizes a pellet\r\nof dung evacuated at that moment. This pellet is extracted very neatly\r\nand moulded into a brick which is measured most carefully. A slight\r\nbend of the creature’s neck sets the brick in place. Others follow,\r\nlaid in the most scrupulously regular courses one above the other.\r\nGiving a tap here and there with its palpi, the grub makes sure of the\r\nsteadiness of the parts, their accurate binding, their orderly\r\narrangement. It turns round in the centre of the work as the edifice\r\nrises, even as a mason does when building a turret.\r\n\r\nSometimes the brick that has been laid becomes loose, because the\r\ncement has given way. The grub takes it up again with its mandibles,\r\nbut, before replacing it, coats it with an adhesive moisture. It holds\r\nit to its anus, whence a gummy consolidating-extract trickles\r\nimmediately and almost imperceptibly. The hump supplies the materials;\r\nthe intestines give, if necessary, the glue that sticks them together.\r\n\r\nIn this way an attractive house is obtained, ovoid in form, polished as\r\nstucco within and adorned on the outside with slightly projecting\r\nscales, similar to those on a cedar-cone. Each of these scales is one\r\nof the bricks that have been produced from the hump. The casket is not\r\nlarge: a cherry-stone would about represent its dimensions; but it is\r\nso accurate, so prettily fashioned that it will bear comparison with\r\nthe finest products of entomological industry.\r\n\r\nThe Bull Onthophagus has not a monopoly of this jeweller’s art: all,\r\nthroughout the group, excel in it to the same degree. One of the\r\nsmallest, the Forked Onthophagus, whose work is hardly larger than a\r\npepper-corn, is as expert as the others in the manufacture of boxes\r\nshaped like a cedar-cone. It is a family gift, an invariable gift,\r\ndespite all differences in size, costume or hornery. The Bison Onitis,\r\nthe Yellow-footed Oniticellus and certainly many others retire, for the\r\ntransformation, into a residence similar in architecture to that of the\r\nOnthophagi; they too tell us that instincts are independent of\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nIn the first week of July let us complete the destruction of the Bull\r\nOnthophagus’ cell, already much impaired by the grub, which, after\r\nexhausting the contents of its knapsack, has gnawed the inner layer of\r\nthe walls. The ruins are removed as easily as the husk of a ripe\r\nwalnut. A sort of shelling process gives us the seed, that is to say,\r\nthe nymphal casket, which comes out quite neatly, without sticking to\r\nits wrapper at any point. Break open the gem. The nymph is there,\r\nhalf-transparent and as it were carved out of crystal. Fortune favours\r\nme with a male, who is more interesting because of his frontal armour.\r\n\r\nThe horns outline a splendid crescent, leaning backwards and resting on\r\nthe shoulders. They are swollen; they are colourless, like everything\r\nthat life elaborates in the midst of a generating-fluid; and at their\r\nbase are the dark ocular specks, not yet capable of sight, but\r\npromising to become so. The clypeus is expanding and beginning to stand\r\nout. Seen from the front, the head is that of a Bull, with a wide\r\nmuzzle and enormous horns, copied from those of the Aurochs.\r\n\r\nIf the artists in the time of the Pharaohs had known the immature\r\nOnthophagus, they would certainly have used him for their hieratical\r\nimages. He is quite as good as the Sacred Beetle and even better from\r\nthe point of view of those oddities which offer such scope to\r\nsacerdotal symbolism. On the front edge of the corselet, a single horn\r\nrises, as powerful as the two others and shaped like a cylinder ending\r\nin a conical knob. It points forward and is fixed in the middle of the\r\nfrontal crescent, projecting a little beyond it. The arrangement is\r\ngloriously original. The carvers of hieroglyphics would have beheld in\r\nit the crescent of Isis wherein dips the edge of the world.\r\n\r\nSome other peculiarities complete the nymph’s curious appearance. To\r\nright and left the abdomen is armed, on either side, with four little\r\nhorns resembling crystal spikes. Total, eleven pieces in the creature’s\r\nharness: two on the forehead; one on the thorax; eight on the abdomen.\r\nThe beast of yore delighted in queer horns: certain reptiles of the\r\ngeological period stuck a pointed spur on their upper eyelids. The\r\nOnthophagus, more greatly daring, sports eight on the sides of his\r\nbelly, in addition to the spear which he plants upon his back. The\r\nfrontal horns may be excused: they are fairly common; but what does he\r\npropose to do with the others? Nothing at all. They are passing\r\nfancies, jewels of early youth; the adult insect will not retain the\r\nleast trace of them.\r\n\r\nThe nymph matures. The appendages of the fore-head, at first quite\r\ncrystalline, now show, when held up to the light, a streak of reddish\r\nbrown, curved like a bow. This is the real horn taking shape,\r\nconsistency and colour. The appendage of the corselet and those of the\r\nbelly, on the other hand, preserve their glassy appearance. They are\r\nbarren sacks, void of any germ capable of development. The organism\r\nproduced them in a moment of impulse; now, scornful, or perhaps\r\npowerless, it allows its work to wither and become useless.\r\n\r\nWhen the nymph sheds its covering and the delicate tunic of the adult\r\nform is rent, these strange horns crumble into fragments, which fall\r\naway with the rest of the cast clothing. In the hope of finding at\r\nleast a trace of the vanished things, the lens vainly explores the\r\nbases but lately occupied. There is nothing appreciable left: the nymph\r\nis now smooth; the real has given place to the non-existent. Of the\r\naccessory panoply so full of promise, absolutely naught remains:\r\neverything has vanished into thin air.\r\n\r\nThe Bull Onthophagus is not the only one endowed with these fleeting\r\nappendages, which completely disappear when the nymph sheds its\r\nclothes. The other members of the tribe possess similar horny\r\nmanifestations on their bellies and corselets. One of them, the\r\nSpectral Onthophagus, on achieving the perfect state, adorns the front\r\nof his corselet with four tiny studs arranged in a semicircle. The two\r\nend ones stand alone; the two middle ones are together. These last\r\ncorrespond exactly with the base of the nymph’s thoracic horn and might\r\neasily be taken for the atrophied remnant of the vanished appendage. We\r\nmust abandon this idea, however, for the lateral studs, which are more\r\ndeveloped than the middle ones, occupy points where the nymph had no\r\nhorns. In this Onthophagus, as in the others, the nymphal armour is\r\nmisleading and abortive.\r\n\r\nCertain Dung-beetles related to the Onthophagi likewise possess horned\r\nnymphs. One of these is the Yellow-footed Oniticellus, the only one\r\nwhom circumstances have allowed me to examine from this point of view.\r\nHe wears, in the nymphal stage, a magnificent horn on his corselet and\r\na row of four spikes on each side of his abdomen, as is the rule among\r\nthe Onthophagi. This all disappears entirely in the adult insect.\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that, if I had known how to improve the occasion some\r\nyears ago, when I was successfully rearing the Bison Onitis sent me\r\nfrom Montpellier, I should have perceived the same armour on the\r\nnymph’s thorax and abdomen. Not having been warned by earlier\r\nobservations and being anxious also to disturb the pair of strangers as\r\nlittle as possible, I let the opportunity slip.\r\n\r\nLet us remark lastly that the Onitis, Oniticellus and Onthophagus\r\ngenera all three construct for the nymphosis a scaly cabin whose shape\r\nsuggests the cedar-cone and the fruit of the alder. One may therefore\r\nadmit, without being too venturesome, that the various builders of\r\nsimilar caskets are all acquainted with the nymphal panoply of a horn\r\non the corselet and a diadem of eight spikes around the abdomen. This\r\nis not equivalent to saying that the armour determines the casket or\r\nthe casket the armour. These curious details go together without\r\ninfluencing each other.\r\n\r\nA simple setting forth of the facts is not enough: we should like to\r\nsee the motive of this horned magnificence. Is it a vague reminiscence\r\nof the customs of olden time, when life spent its excess of young sap\r\nupon quaint creations, banished to-day from our better-balanced world?\r\nIs the Onthophagus the dwarfed representative of an ancient race of\r\nhorned animals now extinct? Does it give us a faint image of the past?\r\n\r\nThe surmise rests upon no valid foundation. The Dung-beetle is recent\r\nin the general chronology of created beings; he ranks among the\r\nlast-comers. With him there is no means of going back to the mists of\r\nthe past, which lends itself to the invention of imaginary precursors.\r\nGeological and even lacustrine schists, rich though the latter be in\r\nDiptera and Weevils, have hitherto furnished not the slightest relic of\r\nthe dung-workers. This being so, it is wiser not to claim horned\r\nancestors from the distant past as accounting for those degenerate\r\ndescendants, the Onthophagi.\r\n\r\nSince the past explains nothing, let us turn to the future. If the\r\nthoracic horn be not a reminiscence, it may be a promise. It represents\r\na timid attempt, which the ages will harden into a permanent weapon. It\r\nlets us assist at the slow and gradual evolution of a new organ; it\r\nshows us life in travail of a thing not yet existing on the adult\r\nBeetle’s corselet, a thing which will exist one day. We catch the\r\ngenesis of the species in the act; the present teaches us how the\r\nfuture is prepared.\r\n\r\nAnd what does the Beetle propose to do with this object of his\r\nambition, this spear which he hopes by and by to place upon his spine?\r\nAt any rate as a dazzling piece of masculine finery the thing is\r\nalready fashionable among the various foreign Scarabs that feed\r\nthemselves and their grubs on decaying vegetable matter. These giants\r\namong the wearers of armoured wing-cases delight in associating their\r\nplacid corpulence with halberds terrible to gaze upon.\r\n\r\nLook at one, Dynastes Hercules by name, a denizen of rotten tree-stumps\r\nunder the scorching skies of the West Indies. The peaceable colossus\r\nwell deserves his epithet: he measures three inches long. Of what\r\nservice can the threatening rapier of the corselet and the toothed\r\nlifting-jack of the forehead be to him, unless it be to make him look\r\ngrand in the presence of his female, herself deprived of these\r\nextravagances? Perhaps also they are of use to him in certain\r\noperations, even as the trident helps the Minotaurus to crumble his\r\npellets and cart his rubbish. Implements of which we do not know the\r\nuse always strike us as singular. Having never been intimate with the\r\nWest-Indian Hercules, I must content myself with suspicions touching\r\nthe purpose of his fearsome equipment.\r\n\r\nWell, one of the subjects in my insect-house would achieve a similar\r\nsavage finery if he persisted in his attempts. I speak of the Cow\r\nOnthophagus (O. vacca). His nymph has on its forehead a big horn, one\r\nonly, bent backward; on its corselet it possesses a similar horn,\r\njutting forward. The two, approaching their tips, look like some kind\r\nof pincers. What does the insect lack in order to acquire, on a smaller\r\nscale, the eccentric ornament of the West-Indian Scarab? It lacks\r\nperseverance. It matures the appendage of the forehead and allows that\r\nof the corselet to perish atrophied. It succeeds no better than the\r\nBull Onthophagus in its attempt to grow a pointed stake upon its back;\r\nit loses a glorious opportunity of making itself fine for the wedding\r\nand terrible in battle.\r\n\r\nThe others are no more successful. I bring up six different species.\r\nAll, in the nymphal state, possess the thoracic horn and the\r\neight-pointed ventral coronet; not one benefits by these advantages,\r\nwhich disappear altogether when the adult bursts its wrapping. My near\r\nneighbourhood numbers a dozen species of Onthophagi; the world contains\r\nsome hundreds. All, natives and foreigners, have the same general\r\nstructure; all most probably possess the dorsal appendage at an early\r\nage; and none of them, in spite of the variety of climate, torrid in\r\none place, temperate in another, has succeeded in hardening it into a\r\npermanent horn.\r\n\r\nCould not the future complete a work whose design is so very clearly\r\ntraced? We are the more inclined to ask this, because appearances are\r\nall in favour of the question. Examine under the magnifying-glass the\r\nfrontal horns of the Bull Onthophagus in the nymphal state; then with\r\nthe same scrupulous care look at the spear upon the corselet. At first,\r\nthere is no difference between them, except for the general\r\nconfiguration. In both cases we find the same glassy aspect, the same\r\nsheath swollen with colourless fluid, the same incipient organ plainly\r\nmarked. A leg in process of formation is not more clearly announced\r\nthan the horn on the corselet or those on the forehead.\r\n\r\nCan time be lacking for the thoracic growth to become organized into a\r\nstiff and permanent appendage? The evolution of the nymph is swift; the\r\ninsect is perfect in a few weeks. Could it not be that, though this\r\nbrief space suffices to promote the maturity of the horns on the\r\nforehead, the thoracic horn requires a longer time to ripen? Let us\r\nprolong the nymphal period artificially and give the germ time to\r\ndevelop. It seems to me that a decrease of temperature, moderated and\r\nmaintained for some weeks, for months if necessary, should be capable\r\nof bringing about this result, by delaying the progress of the\r\nevolution. Then, with a gentle slowness, favourable to delicate\r\nformations, the promised organ will crystallize, so to speak, and\r\nbecome the spear promised by appearances.\r\n\r\nThe experiment attracted me. I was unable to undertake it for lack of\r\nthe means whereby to produce a cold, even temperature over a long time.\r\nWhat should I have obtained if my penury had not made me abandon the\r\nenterprise? A retarding of the progress of the metamorphosis, but\r\nnothing more, apparently. The horn on the corselet would have persisted\r\nin its sterility and, sooner or later, would have disappeared.\r\n\r\nI have reasons for my conviction. The abode of the Onthophagus engaged\r\non his metamorphosis is not deep down; variations of temperature are\r\neasily felt. On the other hand, the seasons are capricious, especially\r\nthe spring. Under the skies of Provence, the months of May and June, if\r\nthe mistral lend a hand, have periods when the thermometer drops in\r\nsuch a way as to suggest a return of winter.\r\n\r\nTo these vicissitudes add the influence of a more northerly climate.\r\nThe Onthophagi occupy a wide zone of latitude. Those of the north, less\r\nfavoured by the sun than those of the south, might quite possibly have\r\nthe date of their transformation postponed by a change in the weather\r\nand consequently be subjected to a lower temperature for several weeks.\r\nThis would spin out the work of evolution and give the thoracic armour\r\ntime to harden into horn, at rare intervals, as chance may prescribe.\r\nHere and there, then, the requisite condition of a moderate or even low\r\ntemperature at the time of the nymphosis actually exists, without the\r\nneed of any artificial agency.\r\n\r\nWell, what becomes of this surplus time placed at the service of the\r\norganic labour? Does the promised horn ripen? Not a bit of it: it\r\nwithers just as it does under the stimulus of a hot sun. In the records\r\nof entomology I find no mention of an Onthophagus carrying a horn upon\r\nhis corselet. No one would even have suspected the possibility of such\r\nan armour, if I had not bruited abroad the strange appearance of the\r\nnymph. The influence of climate, therefore, has nothing to do with the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nAs we go more deeply into it, the question becomes more complicated.\r\nThe horny appendages of the Onthophagus, the Copris, the Minotaurus and\r\nmany others are the male’s prerogative; the female is without them or\r\nwears them only on a reduced and very modest scale. We must look upon\r\nthese products as personal ornaments rather than as implements of\r\nlabour. The male makes himself fine for the pairing; but, with the\r\nexception of the Minotaurus, who pins down the dry pellet that needs\r\ncrushing and holds it in position with his trident, I know none that\r\nuses his armour as a tool. Horns and prongs on the forehead, crests and\r\ncrescents on the corselet are the male coquette’s jewels and nothing\r\nmore. The other sex requires no such baits to attract suitors: its\r\nfemininity is enough; and finery is neglected.\r\n\r\nNow here is something to give us food for thought. The nymph of the\r\nOnthophagus of the female sex, a nymph with an unarmed forehead,\r\ncarries on its thorax a vitreous horn as long, as rich in promise as\r\nthat of the other sex. If this latter excrescence be the design of an\r\nincipient ornament, then the former would be so too, in which case the\r\ntwo sexes, both anxious for self-embellishment, would work with equal\r\nzeal to grow a horn upon their thorax. We should be witnessing the\r\ngenesis of a species that would not be really an Onthophagus, but a\r\nderivative of the group; we should be beholding the commencement of\r\nsingularities banished hitherto from among the Dung-beetles, none of\r\nwhom, of either sex, has thought of planting a spear upon his chine.\r\nStranger still: the female, always the more humbly attired throughout\r\nthe entomological kingdom, would be vying with the male in her\r\nhankering after quaint adornment. An ambition of this sort leaves me\r\nincredulous.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore believe that, if the possibilities of the future\r\nshould ever produce a Dung-beetle carrying a horn upon his corselet,\r\nthis upsetter of present customs will not be an Onthophagus who has\r\nsucceeded in maturing the thoracic appendage of the nymph, but rather\r\nan insect resulting from a new model. The creative power throws aside\r\nthe old moulds and replaces them by others, fashioned with fresh care,\r\nin accordance with plans of an inexhaustible variety. Its laboratory is\r\nnot a peddling rag-fair, where the living assume the cast clothes of\r\nthe dead: it is a medallist’s studio, where each effigy receives the\r\nstamp of a special die. Its treasure-house of forms, illimitable in its\r\nriches, makes niggardliness impossible: there is no patching up of the\r\nold in order to create the new. It breaks every mould once used; it\r\ndoes away with it, without resorting to shabby after-touches.\r\n\r\nThen what is the meaning of those horny preparations, which are always\r\nblighted before they come to anything? With no great shame I confess\r\nthat I have not the slightest idea. My reply may not be couched in\r\nlearned phraseology, but it has one merit, that of absolute sincerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Chapters I. and II. of the present volume, forming the first two\r\nchapters of Vol. I. of the Souvenirs entomologiques.
