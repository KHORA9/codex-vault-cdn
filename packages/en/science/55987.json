The steamers made regular trips, but the fine packets were still\r\nrunning, and it was thought desirable to try the longer voyage for Mrs.\r\nGray’s health.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray renewed acquaintance with his old friends, and made many new\r\nones, meeting at his friend Mr. Ward’s, where they first stayed, many of\r\nthe younger men, Henfrey, Forbes, etc., who had become known in science\r\nsince his former visit in 1839.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nGHENT, BELGIUM, July 16, 1850.\r\n\r\nI surely meant that you should have heard of us long ere this. But there\r\nseemed not to be a moment of time during the fortnight we spent in\r\nEngland; Mr. Ward kept us so busy with every sort of engagement and\r\nsight-seeing that J. could enjoy. I meant to have written at Dover last\r\nevening; but it was not convenient, so now that we are for the first\r\nnight in a strange country (which England is not) I must tell you, what\r\nI trust you have learned from Carey (to whom I had occasion to write\r\nhurriedly, last mail), that we had a very pleasant voyage of seventeen\r\nand a half days and came near making it in fourteen, as we made land\r\nearly on the morning of the twelfth day out, no storms, but gentle\r\nfavoring breezes till we made the Irish coast; and then, to our\r\ndisappointment, we had head winds to beat against all the way up to\r\nHolyhead, and reached Liverpool Saturday morning....\r\n\r\nOn Monday we left Liverpool, which has vastly improved since you saw it;\r\nstopping at Coventry and turning off to Leamington to see, at\r\nDarlington’s desire, the descendants of old Peter Collinson,[1] and\r\ndeliver some books and letters from him, which I did. Mrs. Collinson was\r\nill with a severe fall, but her daughter received the things I brought,\r\nand showed me a portrait of Peter. Then Mrs. Gray and I made an\r\nexcursion to Warwick Castle, the fine ruins of Kenilworth, and\r\nStoneleigh Abbey, driving through six or seven miles of fine park. The\r\nnext day on to London, to Ward, who had insisted on our visiting him. He\r\nlives three and a half miles out of London, in a pleasant and quiet\r\nsuburban house; his son being established in Wellclose Square.\r\n\r\nBoott I saw the same evening I arrived, and two days later, with J., but\r\nnot later. He has been quite sick with an influenza, and a slight but\r\nnot altogether pleasant inflammation of the lungs.\r\n\r\nTo Hooker I went at once also, and got your kind letter there, and saw\r\nKew. Hooker is quite well; but Lady H. is very poorly.... She inquired\r\nmost particularly and affectionately after yourself, and asked about all\r\nyour family....\r\n\r\nOn Monday I made another visit to Kew Gardens, (a grand affair) to show\r\nthe lions of the place to four or five young Americans I knew, one of\r\nthem young Brace,[2] J.’s cousin, who is making with two friends a\r\npleasant and profitable pedestrian excursion in England.[3] I cannot\r\nbegin to tell you the half we have done and seen in England, but we were\r\nmost busy: Saturday, conversazione of Royal Botanical Society in\r\nRegent’s Park. Wednesday, excursion with Linnæan Club to Hertford; saw a\r\ngreat Pinetum, 600 species of Coniferæ, etc., and the Panshanger Oak. (I\r\nwrote Carey a few words of this.) Thursday, a most pleasant day with\r\nHooker. Miss Hooker looks quite well; all send their love to you, all\r\nmost kind and sweet to us. Hooker has altered little, but looks older.\r\nBrown looks older perhaps, but decidedly stronger, is as healthy as\r\npossible and very lively. In talking with him and showing him about it\r\nhe gave up about Krameria, and said I must be right. He formerly\r\nunequivocally referred it to Polygalaceæ. Bennett is large and fat. I\r\nfear he does not work hard enough.\r\n\r\nYesterday we came down to Dover early in the afternoon (a striking\r\nplace), and embarked late in the evening on steamer for Ostend, which we\r\nreached early this morning; came right on to Bruges, which listless and\r\nvery curious old-world town, and its curiosities, we have all day been\r\nexploring, till six o’clock, when we came on twenty-eight miles further\r\nby railway to the famous and more lively town of Ghent,--where I have\r\nbeen running about till the dusk arrived, and must now to bed, as we\r\nhave to finish Ghent to-morrow before dinner, and go on to Antwerp\r\nafterwards, thence to Cologne. I think we shall cut Brussels.\r\n\r\nAt Ghent saw the Belfry and the strange old Town Hall.... I went to the\r\nBotanic Garden (did not find Professor Kickx),--hardly as large as ours\r\nat Cambridge, and by no means so rich or half so well kept, though said\r\nto be the best in Belgium; explored the university library, and strolled\r\nthrough the streets and along the canals....\r\n\r\nAntwerp.--Imagine us settled comfortably at Hotel du Parc, Wednesday\r\nevening, overlooking the Place Verte, our windows commanding a near and\r\nmost advantageous view of the finest cathedral in Belgium, with light\r\nenough still to see pretty well against the sky the graceful outlines\r\nand much of the light tracery and Gothic work of this gem of a steeple,\r\none of the loftiest in the world (403 feet, 7 inches) and probably\r\nunsurpassed by any for lightness, grace, and the elaborateness of the\r\ncarved work. Napoleon compared it to Mechlin lace. And such sweet\r\nchimes, every fifteen minutes! The chime at the beginning of the hour\r\nstill rings in our ears. We have never tired of listening to it....\r\n\r\nBONN, July 22.\r\n\r\nWe drove through the city (Cologne) to the station of the Bonn railroad.\r\nBut on the way the driver, of his own motion, stopped at the door of the\r\ncathedral. Finding that we had time enough to take a good look before\r\nthe train left, we could not resist, and saw this wonder and masterpiece\r\nof true Gothic architecture; which by the united efforts of most North\r\nGerman powers is going on toward completion, in the style and plan on\r\nwhich it was commenced seven hundred or eight hundred years ago, and in\r\nwhich the choir was finished, and the transepts and nave commenced. It\r\nis most grand; the grandest thing we ever saw, though the nave bears\r\nonly a temporary roof, at thirty or forty feet less than the full\r\nheight. The ancient stained glass comes fully up to one’s expectation. I\r\nhave never seen the like.\r\n\r\nWe went up to Poppelsdorf; such charming and picturesque view of the\r\nSiebengebirge (seven mountains) and the Godesberg, etc., from the\r\nprofessor’s windows and the Botanic Garden; the museums rich and\r\ncurious, and parts of the old château in which they are (now surrendered\r\nto the university) not less so. The botanical professors, Treviranus[4]\r\nand Dr. Roemer, very kind; some collections to be made ready here for me\r\nto examine when we come back, so that I must then spend a day here....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nGENEVA, August 16, 1850.\r\n\r\nWe went up the Rhine to Coblenz, Bingen, and Mayence; thence to\r\nFrankfort. By some mistake in the post office in giving me the address,\r\nyour letter to Dr. Fresenius[5] I took to a law-doctor Fresenius, who\r\nwas away in Switzerland. So I gave up all hopes of seeing him, and we\r\nfell to seeing the sights by ourselves, when, a few hours before we had\r\narranged to go to Heidelberg, the true Dr. Fresenius came in. We may see\r\nhim again on our way back. We went to Heidelberg, for an hour or two\r\nonly....\r\n\r\nIt is now the 20th,--time passed fast. I work to-day in herbariums De\r\nCandolle and Boissier, and to-morrow morning we go to Freiburg and Berne\r\nand the Bernese Oberland. We cannot be back now in England so early as\r\nwe expected; but still hope to be there by the 20th September....\r\n\r\nThursday morning, after an early breakfast, went on by railroad to Kehl;\r\nleft our luggage and took a carriage over the bridge of boats, across\r\nthe lines of the French republic (?) into Strasburg. Saw Schimper;[6]\r\nthen we went to the cathedral, viewed the grand front of this imposing\r\nstructure, and the wonderful spire, the tallest in the world; were much\r\nstruck with the grandeur of the interior, wholly lighted by stained\r\nglass, the greater part of it 400 or 500 years old. After visiting the\r\nMuseum of Natural History, and arranging with Schimper to meet him in\r\nSwitzerland, where he is to pass with his wife (a Swiss lady) a long\r\nvacation, we took our carriage and returned to the Baden side of the\r\nriver, and came on to Freiburg (in the Breisgau) that evening, reaching\r\nit in the rain....\r\n\r\nProfessor Braun,[7] the brother of the first Mrs. Agassiz, was very kind\r\nto us. He is a very interesting man, of charming manners; his wife very\r\nsweet and charming, his children most engaging. Saturday afternoon we\r\ntook a carriage, and with Professor Braun rode up a beautiful valley to\r\nthe Höllenthal (French, Vallée d’Enfer), a rocky and wooded gorge of\r\nvery striking scenery; wild and majestic, rather than terrible, as its\r\nname imports....\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon visited the cathedral, one of the finest and oldest in\r\nEurope, that is well preserved. Here nearly every part, and all the\r\nstained glass, of a most curious kind, is perfectly preserved; and the\r\nspire, though not so high as that of Strasburg, is as elaborate and\r\nlight,--as it were of woven stone thread,--and even more beautiful....\r\n\r\nTuesday we rode from Bâle to Bienne (fifty-six miles) in a diligence,\r\nfrom eight A.M. to five P.M., through the Münster Thal, the grandest and\r\nmost picturesque scenery of the Jura.\r\n\r\nWednesday, a ride of three hours along lakes of Bienne and Neuchâtel\r\nbrought us to Neuchâtel at eleven o’clock A.M. ... Professor Godet,[8]\r\nwho received me most cordially, took me (with Mr. Coulon) up the\r\nChaumont, 2,500 feet; but the Alps were obscured by clouds, at least the\r\nhigher Alps, and we had no fine view of them; otherwise the view was\r\nvery fine. We returned by the great boulder Pierre à Bot. All asked\r\nafter Agassiz with much interest. Excursions are planned for us when we\r\nreturn....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray enjoyed the visit to Geneva, where he renewed his friendship\r\nwith MM. Alphonse De Candolle and Boissier, accomplishing some useful\r\nwork, and having pleasant social meetings and excursions. He went to\r\nChamouni and the Bernese Oberland; then to Munich, especially to meet\r\nagain Martius, with whom he had been in constant correspondence, and who\r\nmade the journey from Tyrol to greet his old friend. Their few days\r\ntogether were greatly enjoyed.\r\n\r\nHe returned to England, going down the Neckar by steamboat to\r\nHeidelberg, then down the Rhine, and through Holland, where he saw\r\nMiquel[9] in Amsterdam, rambling with him on a fête-day through the\r\nstreets at evening, enjoying the queer sights; went to Leyden, meeting\r\nDe Vriese,[10] with whom was R. Brown (then staying in Leyden for a few\r\ndays), and seeing the Botanic Garden, one of the oldest in Europe, and\r\nwell known to Linnæus. Blume[11] he missed, but he saw Siebold’s[12]\r\ncollection of Japanese curios, then most rare. He took steamer from\r\nRotterdam to London, and after a few days went down to Mr. Bentham’s, in\r\nHerefordshire.\r\n\r\nHere were spent two months of very hard work with Mr. Bentham, who most\r\nkindly went over with him the plants of the United States Exploring\r\nExpedition, which had been brought over the Atlantic for the purpose.\r\n\r\nPontrilas is in a pretty, hilly country on the border of Wales, with\r\nmany old churches, almost of Saxon time, in the neighborhood, to give\r\ninterest to walks, and very interesting, agreeable neighbors for a day\r\nor two’s visiting, among them the authoress, Mrs. Archer Clive, who was\r\nvery kind.\r\n\r\nHe left Pontrilas early in December to make a visit, at Dublin, to his\r\nfriend Professor Harvey, to stay in the family of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nTodhunter, Dr. Harvey’s sister. Going on board the steamer at ten in the\r\nevening, he met with the severe accident of which he gives an account in\r\nhis letters. Dr. Harvey came from Dublin to help in nursing him. His\r\nvigor and elasticity helped him to a speedy recovery, but it increased a\r\ngeneral tendency to stoop, and he was never so erect afterwards.\r\n\r\nHe was able to get to Kew the last of December, and spent the winter in\r\nhard work in Sir William Hooker’s herbarium, which was then in his house\r\nat West Park.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCUMBERLAND PLACE, KEW, December 28, 1850.\r\n\r\nYour kind favor of December 6th, forwarded to me by Bentham, to Dublin,\r\nwould have been sooner acknowledged, but that it found me an invalid. On\r\nour way from Hereford to Dublin I had just gone on board a steamer at\r\nHolyhead, early in the evening; had left Mrs. Gray in the ladies’ cabin,\r\nwhen, coming on deck again, I stepped over an open hatchway which had\r\nbeen left for the moment very carelessly unguarded and unlighted. I fell\r\nfull eighteen feet, they say, to the bottom of the hold, striking partly\r\non my right hand and the side of my right leg, bruising and straining\r\nboth, but principally on my right side against a timber projecting from\r\nthe floor, fracturing two of my ribs. It is truly wonderful that I was\r\nnot more seriously and permanently injured. I was taken on shore at once\r\nand had good medical attendance. I recovered so rapidly that in a week I\r\nwas comfortably taken across to Dublin, where I was kindly cared for by\r\ngood friends; in two weeks more I left for London, able to walk without\r\ndifficulty; and to-day, just four weeks after the accident, I have begun\r\nto work at plants again, in Sir William Hooker’s herbarium. But my side\r\nis still tender, and my strength is not great.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much of my bodily condition, let me no longer delay to\r\nthank you heartily for the very unexpected compliment that you have\r\ncaused to be paid me, and to ask you to convey, in fitting terms, my\r\ngrateful acknowledgments to the Société de Physique et d’Histoire\r\nNaturelle, for the honor they have conferred upon me in choosing me as\r\none of their corresponding members. I was not aware that I had rendered\r\nany particular services to your society, but I shall be very glad to do\r\nso if any opportunity offers. Although, generally, I am far from\r\ncoveting compliments of this kind, I assure you I am much pleased to be\r\nthus associated with several valued personal friends, my contemporaries,\r\nand with such highly honored names of the past generation....\r\n\r\nWe had eight weeks of most pleasant and profitable labor at Pontrilas,\r\nand Mr. Bentham has rendered me invaluable assistance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gray joins me in the expression of kind remembrances and regard to\r\nMadame De Candolle and yourself.\r\n\r\nBelieve me to remain, ever most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince Dr. Gray was so near Sir William, and working in the herbarium\r\nalmost every day, there was much meeting of old friends, and of many of\r\nthe men distinguished in botany. Robert Brown, with his keen observation\r\nand dry wit, he saw constantly at the British Museum, Dr. Wallich,[13]\r\nMr. Miers and many others. There was some social visiting in London and\r\nthe neighborhood. Mr. Abbott Lawrence was then American minister in\r\nLondon, and he and Mrs. Lawrence were very kind and attentive, giving\r\nhim a chance to see at an evening reception some of the great men of the\r\nLondon world: the Duke of Wellington, Lady Morgan, Whewell the Master of\r\nTrinity, Lord Boughton, Lord Gough, and many others.\r\n\r\nIt was the year of the first great World’s Exhibition, and the building\r\nwas then considered very wonderful. Through the kindness of Professor\r\nLindley he was enabled to see it before it was completed.\r\n\r\nThere was a very charming visit to Oxford in March, where Dr. Gray made\r\nmost delightful acquaintances. He there first met Dean Church, then a\r\nfellow of Oriel, who had him to dine. He also dined with Mr.\r\nCongreve[14] at Wadham; met Maskeleyne, who showed him “some fine\r\ntalbotypes, which are a sort of daguerreotype on paper, and have a\r\nbeautiful effect for landscapes and buildings.” Breakfasted with Mr.\r\nBurgon and Mr. Church, at Oriel, in Dr. Pusey’s old rooms, and met Mr.\r\nBurgon again at dinner, when dining in the “Common Room,” at a dinner\r\ngiven him by Mr. Church, and also Buckle and Sclater. Dr. Jacobson, then\r\nRegius professor of divinity, afterwards Bishop of Chester, and Mrs.\r\nJacobson, were very kind. Dr. Daubeny was then professor of botany at\r\nOxford, and there were some plants to look at in the small herbarium\r\nkept in the little Botanic Garden in an old greenhouse. The days were\r\ncrowded with interesting sight-seeing and in meeting agreeable people.\r\n\r\nFrom Oxford, Dr. Gray went to Cambridge, where he met again a traveling\r\nacquaintance made on the passage from Rotterdam, Dr. Thompson, then\r\nGreek tutor, later Master of Trinity, who was very kind in doing the\r\nhonors of Trinity, King’s Chapel, etc. At his rooms, Dr. Gray met\r\nProfessor Challis and other Cambridge men. The grounds about the\r\ncolleges were then at their greatest beauty, the banks of the Cam yellow\r\nwith primroses, the whole setting off the beautiful bridges and stately\r\nbuildings. Another traveling acquaintance met in the street, recalling\r\nan experience on the Furca, asked Dr. Gray to dine with him at Caius\r\nCollege, saying his name was Mackenzie. He was Bishop Mackenzie, who\r\ndied in south Africa.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Kew, Dr. Gray found Dr. Joseph Hooker, just back from\r\nhis journey to the Himalayas and Thibet. Dr. Thompson[15] was also\r\nthere, just home from India, where he had been imprisoned with Lady Sale\r\nand others, twenty of them in one small room, during the trouble in\r\nAfghanistan. And one day came an invitation to lunch from the Hookers’,\r\n“to meet Mr. Darwin, who is coming to meet Dr. Hooker; is distinguished\r\nas a naturalist.” “Mr. Darwin was a lively, agreeable person” [Mrs.\r\nGray’s journal].\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\n5 CUMBERLAND PLACE, KEW, April 14, 1851.\r\n\r\nFor myself I am glad that I am perfectly recovered from the effects of\r\nmy accident, and am as active as ever. I have passed a very pleasant\r\nwinter, and have prosecuted my studies to great advantage, though there\r\nstill remains, alas! more for me to do than I can hope to accomplish in\r\nthe time that is still left for me. Your letter was just in time to\r\nreach me here; for we had just decided to go to Paris early next week;\r\nto remain there until the 1st of June, at least. The only drawback is\r\nthat we thereby lose the society of Mr. and Mrs. Bentham, who mean to\r\ncome to London early next month....\r\n\r\nSir William Hooker is not yet well, though better than he was last\r\nwinter. I have presented your kind messages, for which he sends best\r\nthanks, and is rejoiced to hear of your recovery. Sir William is truly a\r\nnoble man; the more intimately you know him the more strongly attached\r\nto him you become....\r\n\r\nI had thought it quite likely that we might pass through Geneva again\r\nthis summer; but that is not now possible. The sea, however, is not so\r\nbroad as formerly. Believe me to remain,\r\n\r\nVery faithfully and affectionately yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn April Dr. and Mrs. Gray went to Paris, where he worked busily through\r\nthe mornings at the Jardin des Plantes, taking the afternoon for his\r\nsight-seeing. He met again his old friends, Jussieu, Decaisne, Gay,\r\netc., and made the acquaintance of M. and Mme. Vilmorin, both most\r\ncharming and interesting people; the former distinguished as a\r\nhorticulturist, and both making investigations for many years on the\r\nvarieties of strawberries, for which Mme. V. made all the drawings. Two\r\nseparate days were passed at Verrières, their country home, an old villa\r\nbelonging formerly to the Duchesse de la Vallière. And here to meet him\r\ncame old Michaux[16] the younger, then eighty-one, who had walked from\r\nhis home (fifteen leagues), for the pleasure of seeing Dr. Gray. And it\r\nwas at Dr. Gray’s request that both Michaux and Jussieu sat for their\r\ndaguerreotypes for him, the only satisfactory likenesses of either. Mr.\r\nFrançois Delessert[17] extended pleasant hospitalities, and Mr. Webb was\r\nvery kind and cordial.\r\n\r\nIt was during the time of the Republic, Louis Napoleon, president, and\r\nthere were some grand fêtes in May, in honor of the Republic, at which\r\nthe officers of the government were conspicuously absent.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray returned to Kew in June to continue his work, broken only by\r\nsome days in London.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nPARIS, April 30, 1851.\r\n\r\nDEAR BENTHAM,--I cannot give your message to Weddell, for he is on his\r\nway to the Peruvian cinchona forests, to remain a year,--I suppose on a\r\ncommission from the manufacturers of quinine. Jussieu still suffers with\r\nsome affection of the stomach, but is much better than last winter.\r\nDecaisne is quite well, but is occupied with the _Culture_, and is\r\nlittle in the herbarium, where Spach, Tulasne,[18] Naudin,[19] and\r\nTrécul[20] are in charge, under Brongniart and Jussieu. Webb is well,\r\nand so is Gay, who is quite happy, living on his half pay, which the\r\nRepublic has secured to him, with his rooms free of rent, and some\r\nsavings from his former income. I have not seen Gaudichaud yet; but he\r\nhas offered to come and show me his Sandwich Island collections, etc.,\r\nof which he has issued some plates, in “La Voyage de la Bonite,” but no\r\ntext has appeared, and none seems likely to appear.\r\n\r\nI gave to Dr. Alexander the list and notes on Fendler’s Chagres plants.\r\nHe will hand it to you when he sees you in London.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nPARIS, May 6, 1851.\r\n\r\nRobert Brown told me that Link would be succeeded in his excellent and\r\nlucrative professorship either by Grisebach[21] or by our excellent\r\nfriend Braun. Since I have been here, a young man from Berlin says that\r\nthe choice has fallen on Braun,--to my great joy, for I love Braun very\r\nmuch. I have given Lowell, who leaves Paris to-day, and will be in\r\nGermany in June and July, a letter to Braun, addressed to Giessen or\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nPrince Paul’s sensitive branches of Mimosa catching unwary travelers is\r\nrich!\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning, June 11.\r\n\r\nSettled down to usual Kew routine; glad enough to get back to quiet and\r\nsuperlative neatness; to less elegance than our Parisian quarters, but\r\ndecidedly more comfort. The only thing that distresses us is, that we\r\ncannot translate dear Mrs. Crook bodily to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\r\nSure we would if she were younger; but the dear old creature will now\r\nerelong be translated to a far better land.... Unpacked (which in\r\ninterminableness is only second to packing up) and went down to the\r\nHookers’....\r\n\r\nFriday, after writing and dispatching letters home, we went up to\r\nLondon, shopped, etc., in the City; streets nasty (the English word is\r\nvery appropriate; no wonder they always use it), and such a contrast to\r\nbeautiful and gay Paris, which is vastly more convenient and agreeable\r\nfor shopping....\r\n\r\nSaturday, ... a little stroll in the Gardens, which are looking\r\nbeautifully, the trees loaded with rich foliage, and the great masses of\r\nRhododendrons in blossom.\r\n\r\nIn the evening went with Dr. Hooker up to the last soirée of Lord Rosse,\r\nthe president of the Royal Society; too late to see Prince Albert, who\r\ncame and went early; saw the usual dons. Sir Charles Lyell asked if I\r\nhad stayed abroad all the time since last year, or had just come over\r\nafresh!...\r\n\r\nWednesday, we were off early in the morning, to make our first visit to\r\nthe Great Exhibition. We went up to town by railroad as usual; walked\r\nover Waterloo bridge, and having reached the Strand, had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing nine omnibuses pass westward, all full.\r\nDespairing of all hope of getting into an omnibus, we were just turning\r\nto look for a cab, when a well-dressed and respectable woman, who had\r\nbeen making similar unsuccessful attempts, rushed up to us, exclaiming,\r\n“Oh! are you going to the Exhibition? Will you not take a cab with me?\r\nI have been trying for an omnibus in vain this half hour, and I have\r\nmade an appointment with some friends there at half past ten.” We agreed\r\nat once to this reasonable and very convenient proposition, and we\r\nshared the expense accordingly, with many expressions of thanks on the\r\nlady’s part. Before we had reached within half a mile of the Crystal\r\nPalace we were obliged to fall into dense line, with a close double file\r\nof cabs, carriages, dog-carts, and other “vehicular conveyances,” all\r\nwending their way thither, a similar file of empty carriages returning\r\non the other side of the street; the sidewalks as well as the roads\r\ninside the park all crowded with pedestrians. Early as we were, a vast\r\nnumber of people were already there, but scattered through the vast\r\ninterior, they scarcely made a crowd, until midday, when the more\r\nattractive parts of the structure, the principal streets and squares, so\r\nto say, were thronged.\r\n\r\nAs to what we saw, is it not written at length in the great Official\r\nCatalogue (as far as that ponderous document is yet published), besides\r\nthe Abridged Catalogue, in itself quite a sizable book, which we mean to\r\nbring home, with the Synopsis, and other things, quite a library, and I\r\ndare say you have heard and read quite enough about it. I doubt whether\r\nyou have seen the excellent and spirited articles in the “Times,”\r\nbeginning long before the building was finished, which give a most\r\nadmirable and lively account of everything.\r\n\r\nThe general impression of the interior was not quite so imposing, did\r\nnot give such an idea of the vastness, as when we saw it in April, less\r\nfull, and the long spaces unbroken.\r\n\r\nOn our way down the nave, we stopped for a moment to see the Koh-i-noor,\r\nbut the Mountain of Light looked to us little brighter than a piece of\r\ncut-glass. It does not come up to the general expectation. Manage it as\r\nthey will, it does not shine at all wonderfully, and the people got it\r\ninto their heads that the authorities were shamming them with a glass\r\nimitation instead of the veritable Koh-i-noor; an idea well expressed in\r\n“Punch,” who called it “the knave of diamonds.” We determined to show\r\nour patriotism by going first of all carefully through the American\r\ndepartment, and quite a trial to one’s patriotism it is, a great space,\r\nvery scantily filled with an ill-assorted, incongruous collection\r\n(although they have given up to Russia and France about one quarter of\r\nthe space that Mr. Lawrence asked for and insisted upon having): one\r\nlong shelf displayed only half a dozen wooden pails; another side was\r\ndecorated with a miserable collection of cast-off specimens of\r\nautumn-leaves, and below with a case containing five or six dozen\r\nbottles of prepared magnesia, all just alike, flanked at the sides with\r\na similar collection of Old Jacob Townsend’s Sarsaparilla, surmounted by\r\na portrait of the illustrious inventor. The strength of the nation has\r\ngone to daguerreotypes, of which there are about two thousand very good\r\nspecimens of the art, it must be said, far better than they can produce\r\nin England. The same may be said of many things, creditable in\r\nthemselves, but of which they have filled up their space, or attempted\r\nto fill it, with an enormous number of specimens, where one or two would\r\nsuffice. But wherever anything is quite poor and commonplace, the\r\nexhibitor is sure to make it up in brag, in which it must be confessed\r\nwe do “beat all creation.”\r\n\r\nMonday we went to the Zoölogical Gardens, very extensive, in fine\r\nkeeping, the richest collection of living animals of all sorts in the\r\nworld. Were very much amused with monkeys of all sorts and sizes, from\r\nthose little larger than a rat to the great and sedate orang-outang,[22]\r\njust arrived, who is quite a human and a very respectable grave old\r\nfellow. We saw the hippopotamus, too, but he lay sleeping in the sun,\r\nand would give no sign of life except occasionally opening his eye and\r\ngiving a wink. But one of the most amusing sights was the little\r\nsuckling elephant, with its mother, and it was curious to see the little\r\nthing use its trunk as perfectly and knowingly as its mother.... We\r\nstayed to see the ferocious animals fed, at half past four, no great\r\nsight, as they behaved extremely proper, and then we hurried back to the\r\nstation and came home to Kew.\r\n\r\nA short visit to the British Museum, which is an immense collection of\r\nobjects of natural history, sculpture, books, antiquities, etc., etc.\r\nHad some botanical work in the herbarium there (the British Museum), but\r\ndid not do anything that day, for we spent the time talking to Mr.\r\nBrown, who was in quite a chatty mood. He is a singular-looking man,\r\nwith a very heavy lower lip and jaw, and generally carries his head\r\ndown; but it is curious to watch him, and see how he kindles up, and\r\nwhat a satirical twinkle comes in the corner of his eyes when he tells\r\nsome story, for he has a good deal of satire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray went to the meeting of the British Association at Ipswich,\r\nwhere Prince Albert came for a few days. Dr. Hooker and Dr. Harvey (who\r\nhad been making a visit at Kew), and other scientific friends, were\r\nthere. Among other discussions in one of the sections was one on the\r\npossibility of a railroad to the Pacific, a paper by Asa Whitney, “which\r\nhad been brought before the Geographical Society in London, and reported\r\non favorably.”\r\n\r\nFrom Ipswich he made a most interesting visit to Lady Hooker’s father,\r\nDawson Turner, seeing his very valuable collections, autographs,\r\npictures, etc., and returning to Kew to work until breaking up to go\r\nback to America. A short trip was made in Ireland, and Dr. Gray went to\r\nPontrilas to say goodby to Mr. and Mrs. Bentham, immediately before the\r\nvoyage. Dr. and Mrs. Gray were again at home, September 4.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Gray’s return from Europe, his busy life went on, filled with\r\ncollege work and the care of the Garden as accompaniments to a study of\r\nthe new collections constantly coming in, the work on the Exploring\r\nExpedition, the keeping his various botanical text-books in their new\r\neditions up with the advancing science, and his always large\r\ncorrespondence. His letters were chiefly on the questions upon which he\r\nwas working, but with many touches on events of interest of the day, and\r\nlittle playful turns. He says in a letter to Dr. Engelmann, “I well know\r\nI have too many irons in the fire.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Mr. Darwin destroyed all the letters he received before\r\n1862, except the one published in his “Life and Letters,” which is\r\ninserted later, as well as one to Sir Joseph Hooker taken from the same\r\nvolume. The rest of those to Sir Joseph are mostly bound up in the\r\nbotanical correspondence at Kew.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray was an immense worker. After his morning mail was received and\r\nlooked over, that he might answer any imperative questions, he took\r\ndaylight for his scientific work, and, with pauses for meals, and the\r\nnecessary interruptions that came at times, he kept steadily on all the\r\nday. He wrote his letters and his elementary botanical works mostly in\r\nthe evening. But in his younger days his eyes were unusually strong, and\r\nhe would work with the microscope by lamp-light as readily as by\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nThough a steady and unwearying worker he was not rapid. He would throw\r\naside sheet after sheet to be rewritten, especially if there was\r\nanything he wished to make particularly clear and strong, or any\r\nreasoning to be worked out from the soundest point of view. It was\r\nalways a wonder to those about him that he could stand as he did the\r\nunceasing labor, but he was a sound sleeper even if the hours might be\r\nshort, and of a vigorous, wiry, active temperament, and when he did take\r\na holiday, he took it heartily. His rest and recreation were in\r\njourneys, longer or shorter, and every two or three years some long\r\nouting would be taken, to give him the needed refreshment. But he must\r\nalways be busy even then, somewhere to go, something to see; rest in\r\nquiet seemed impossible to him for more than a day at a time.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 23, 1852.\r\n\r\nI am printing on “Plantæ Wrightianæ,” the first part of which (as I work\r\nin so much general matter, especially Tex-Mexican), to the end of\r\nCompositæ, will take 225 pages or more, with ten plates,--the most\r\nimportant memoir I ever wrote, and will indelibly fix our name on the\r\nTexan-New-Mexican Flora....\r\n\r\nI have just found a letter of Sullivant’s, dated May 27, 1850, in which\r\nhe says, “Send me by all means Wright’s Texan Mosses and Hepaticæ....”\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! as I wrote you before, he lost his wife while I was away,\r\nand was overwhelmed, as she was everything to him, and as good a\r\nmuscologist almost as he....\r\n\r\nYou are in a fine field. Hold on and keep a good heart. I long to see\r\nwhat Colonel Graham is now bringing on to me....\r\n\r\nJune 5.\r\n\r\nThere, my dear Wright, I consider myself very much of a gentleman! For\r\nyour favor of the 12th April reached me only this afternoon, and now\r\nbefore the sun has gone down I am answering it! Your letter came very\r\nopportunely too. For, though Colonel Graham has been back so long, it\r\nwas only yesterday that I got the collection he brought home with him to\r\nIndianola (and the seeds); and to-day I opened it and had looked over\r\nonly two bundles. And I was saying to myself, Now if I only had Mr.\r\nWright’s list with localities, I should do very well. And when my\r\nletters came from the office, yours, with said list inclosed, was among\r\nthem. The plants look well, but I have only peeped into them yet. I am\r\nglad if you have found Amoreuxia malvafolia, but I have not yet hit upon\r\nit....\r\n\r\nI am still very busy with college work, for a month longer, and with the\r\nGarden; and the Exploring Expedition work has been pressing me, and\r\nstill will. But I shall somehow distribute your 1851 collection very\r\nsoon, name them up to the end of Compositæ, and in the course of the\r\nsummer determine many of the monopetalous families. I have already named\r\nand described a few of these and some Apetalæ to please Colonel Graham,\r\nand named a new Pentstemon after him (which I have growing, too), which\r\ncompliment seems to gratify him.\r\n\r\nBy this time you will have received the index and plates of “Plantæ\r\nWrightianæ.” Copies are already in England, and I am about to dispatch\r\nmany to France, Germany, etc.\r\n\r\nYou are indeed an invaluable collector, though you do like to grumble\r\nnow and then, and I hope the Indians won’t catch you. If they must take\r\na scalp or a head, there are others I could better spare. So take care\r\nof yourself....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nFebruary 23, 1852.\r\n\r\nI carefully keep your flowering bit of Fendlera, ready to return it if\r\nLindheimer does not get more, as I trust he will. It is the most\r\ninteresting of North American genera, between Deutzia and Philadelphus,\r\nand shows plainly that both are saxifragaceous....\r\n\r\nJuly 28.\r\n\r\nI am worked almost to distraction. But college work is now over and I\r\ncan get on with fewer irons in the fire.\r\n\r\nI fear you are driven up hard also, by the sickly season and cholera. I\r\nhope you may be able to give up practice by and by....\r\n\r\nI have had for a good while a misunderstanding with Captain Wilkes\r\nabout my work for the Exploring Expedition botany. It is now made up, I\r\nthink, or nearly, but I have had no pay from them for a long time, and\r\nthey are a year behind in paying. I have got manuscript of several\r\nfamilies all ready for the press, and some fine drawings. I am just now\r\nworking up “Plantæ Wrightianæ,” 1851 collection, up to end of Compositæ,\r\nold stopping-place, but must dash beyond that soon....\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 4, 1852.\r\n\r\nHere is a discovery! I have to-day received by post from Dr. J. F.\r\nBeaumont, of Mountain Home, in the upper part of Alabama, specimens of a\r\nTrichomanes, which he finds growing there under shelving rocks. I send\r\nyou herewith the half of what is sent me, knowing you will be much\r\ninterested in the discovery, for the first time, of a Trichomanes in the\r\nUnited States; and thinking that you will probably pronounce it to be a\r\nform of the T. radicans, though so much smaller than my Irish and West\r\nIndian specimens.... I have not specimens enough of T. radicans to\r\nsatisfy myself entirely, and refer the question to your experienced\r\njudgment. Pray give me your opinion, for the addition of a single\r\nspecies to our few ferns, and especially one of this group, is a matter\r\nof moment to us, and worthy of a published notice.\r\n\r\nI should not be so greatly surprised now if Hymenophyllum ciliatum,\r\ncredited by Willdenow to Virginia, should turn up, but I still think\r\nthere was some mistake about that; and I could find no specimen in\r\nWilldenow’s herbarium when I sought for it, in 1839....\r\n\r\nNext Wednesday’s steamer, which takes this letter, will also take, for a\r\nshort European tour, my good father-in-law, Mr. Loring, with Mrs.\r\nLoring, and Mrs. Gray’s brother Charles. A rather sudden determination,\r\nbut we have strongly urged the journey ever since the death of their\r\ndear little boy, the little Benjamin, who seemed given to be the comfort\r\nand stay of their declining years, who was born just before our return\r\nhome, a year ago last summer. The rest and change are needful to Mr.\r\nLoring, also, from being worn down by his long-continued labors at the\r\nbar, of which he is perhaps the leader in Boston; I am confident it will\r\nbe of great benefit to him; and the Old World has much to interest a man\r\nof his refined taste.... And then Kew Garden is to them one of the\r\nwonders of the world, as well as a place with which they have, through\r\nus, so many pleasant associations. Should you wish them to enjoy the\r\nprivilege of seeing the Gardens under your own kind auspices, would you\r\nnotify Mr. Loring through Boott (for I do not now know what will be\r\ntheir London address), of a day that would be agreeable and convenient\r\nto yourself....\r\n\r\nJanuary 4, 1853.\r\n\r\nWright will now soon be off in Ringgold’s North Pacific Surveying\r\nExpedition, to explore Behring Straits, Kurile Islands, the coast of\r\nJapan, if possible, and to winter at the Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\nSo we shall have no more New Mexican plants from him.\r\n\r\nMy new memoir, “Plantæ Wrightianæ,” is now almost all printed, and\r\ncontains many novelties. I never had a collection so rich in entirely\r\nnew things.\r\n\r\nI long to hear what you will say of the Trichomanes from Alabama which I\r\nsent you.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes for the new year to you and all yours, I remain,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nJanuary 28, 1853.\r\n\r\n“It never rains but it pours” is an old adage suitable to this meridian\r\nand illustrated by what I now send you, namely, a second Trichomanes\r\nfrom Alabama! discovered by the indefatigable Thomas M. Peters, Esq., of\r\nMoulton, who (and not Mr. Beaumont, it appears) was the first finder of\r\nTrichomanes radicans in Alabama.\r\n\r\nThis one seems to me clearly a new one....\r\n\r\nI think it particularly appropriate in this case that it should bear the\r\nname of its discoverer, so I have called it Trichomanes Petersii, and\r\nhave sent a little article on it and Trichomanes radicans to “Silliman’s\r\nJournal.” ...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1853 began Dr. Gray’s long correspondence with the Dean of St.\r\nPaul’s--a friendship whose intimacy was ever increasing and which lasted\r\nthrough his life.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nFebruary 7, 1853.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. CHURCH,--Since I heard, which I did first from Mr.\r\nClough,[23] that you were about to marry and take charge of a parish, I\r\nhave been longing every time I wrote to England to add a line expressing\r\nmy most sincere congratulations. I hope you will not think me too\r\npresuming if I make bold to do so, and if I ask you where your parish\r\nis, for I would gladly form some idea of where your home is to be.\r\nPleasant and desirable on many accounts as an Oxford life must be, yet I\r\ncannot but think you more appropriately placed in the pleasant parsonage\r\nI can fancy, the centre of a little world of your own, and the spiritual\r\nguide of an attached body of parishioners, where you will be very happy\r\nand very useful.\r\n\r\nStill let us hope that the visit to Cambridge, New England, is only\r\ndeferred, to afford us a double gratification. I think you can sometimes\r\nleave your parish for three months, or even more with special leave, and\r\nthe voyage is becoming shorter and cheaper every year.\r\n\r\nI have looked through the “Times,” which I see regularly through the\r\nkindness of a friend, thinking that I might perchance see your\r\nappointment, presentation, or whatever it may be, mentioned; but in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I am glad to see that you have elected Mr. Gladstone. Your\r\nname on the Oxford Committee makes me suppose you have not yet left\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nDr. Albro has returned in restored health, and speaks with much\r\ngratification of his visit to Oxford, only regretting that your absence\r\nprevented his making your acquaintance until the last moment of his\r\nshort stay.\r\n\r\nMr. Clough brought me a letter from Maskelyne of Wadham College.\r\nCircumstances, I am sorry to say, have yet prevented me from seeing him\r\nhere as much as I could wish. I hope soon to know him better. He has\r\nexcellent and influential acquaintances; but one hardly sees what he is\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nIf he holds Unitarian views, as I have been told, he will perhaps be\r\nmore favorably situated, just in Boston or Cambridge, than in England,\r\nand probably meet more cultivated and more religious people of that\r\npersuasion than at home. But if he sympathizes rather with Francis\r\nNewman and that school, as some one tells me, I should think he would\r\nnot find that class of people here very attractive to him. But I hope\r\nthat is not his bent. I have no partiality for Unitarianism, though it\r\nis the faith of near and valued friends. I am an orthodox Presbyterian,\r\nas my fathers were. But in England I should be a Churchman, although a\r\npretty low one, at least in some respects; and I am a most hearty\r\nwell-wisher to the Church of England. So pray, when settled in your\r\nparish, just drop me a line to say where you are, and how old your\r\nparish church is; for hankering after antiquities is, as an Oxford man\r\ntold me, a great failing of Americans.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 28, 1853.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I am all the more glad that I can direct your attention\r\nto the fourth volume (new series) of the “Memoirs of the American\r\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences,” p. 382, where you will find your name\r\nenrolled as the sole Honorary Member for Switzerland.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily neither you nor I would be at all solicitous for such\r\nrecognition. I care not to have them except where (as in the Linnæan\r\nSociety of London, the French Academy, and your own society of Geneva) I\r\nwell know the nominations are strictly and conscientiously weighed, and\r\nwhere the list to be filled is a limited one. But we here prize the\r\nname of De Candolle so highly that we count it a privilege to have it on\r\nour foreign list....\r\n\r\nI should state that this academy, the oldest but one in America, was in\r\na state of inactivity and hebetude since the death of its former\r\npresident, Bowditch, till 1843, the year after I came to Cambridge, when\r\nit was determined, chiefly by some of my colleagues in Cambridge, to\r\nrestore it to life and vigor. It is now full of life. The number of its\r\nforeign members is now limited to seventy-five, and they are chosen by a\r\nvery formal process and a very rigid scrutiny, so as to have only the\r\nvery best names in the several departments of knowledge. Formerly they\r\nwere chosen without such care; so that there are names on the list that\r\ncould not be placed there now. Hereafter the list will be a most select\r\none....\r\n\r\nHereafter we will send our parcels through the Smithsonian Institution\r\nand through its agent, Mr. Hector Bossange, Paris. You justly praise the\r\npublications of this institution. It is on the point of issuing another\r\nsplendid volume; and at least one a year will continue to be issued.[24]\r\n\r\nLiberal in its distribution, the Smithsonian Institution looks to its\r\nexchanges as a means of building up a library valuable for scientific\r\nresearches in this country. You may remember that, when at Geneva, I\r\nventured to ask you to recommend to the Société de Physique et\r\nd’Histoire Naturelle de Genève, to vote its series of memoirs to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. But you thought it would not then be quite\r\nproper to request it. Now that the institution has given such evidences\r\nof its vigor and productiveness, and that I can assure you it is only\r\nbeginning to do its work, and that in number of volumes it will soon\r\novertake you, I venture to renew the request which I was then requested\r\nto make; and I think that your society, with these assurances, and in\r\nview of the good offices of the Smithsonian in promoting interchanges\r\n(at no small expense), would freely accord the earlier volumes of its\r\nmemoirs, on your proposition....\r\n\r\nDr. Harris[25] has made interesting researches on the plants cultivated\r\nby our aborigines, which I urge him to publish; but he is one of those\r\npersons who are never quite ready to print as long as they live.\r\n\r\nI have long suspected that Helianthus tuberosus came from North America.\r\nI should like to study from what indigenous species it comes....\r\n\r\nAs to the “Botany of the South Sea Exploring Expedition,” the manuscript\r\nand the drawings are ready up nearly to the Leguminosæ; and the\r\nprinting, which is not under my control, is about to commence. The work\r\nwill probably make three quarto volumes and 300 folio plates. I shall be\r\nsure to have a copy to send you. As to the specimens, there are few\r\nduplicates; and of these I am not myself allowed to retain any.\r\nPossibly, hereafter, some may be awarded to me. That expedition did not\r\nland on the high Antarctic coasts it saw, and therefore made no\r\ncollections there. Its Antarctic collection is all from Orange Harbor,\r\nTierra del Fuego, and has little that is new.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part of the collection was made at the Sandwich and\r\nFeejee islands.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I well remember what a charming place Vallon is, and retain\r\npleasant memories of our trip to the Salève under the charge of Madame\r\nDe Candolle, despite the bad weather which spoiled the view. We should\r\ndelight to revisit Switzerland. Having no children, it is not impossible\r\nthat we may do so; but the time, I fear, is far in the future....\r\n\r\nI have written a much longer letter than I had intended when I began.\r\n\r\nBelieve me to remain, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 14, 1853.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ENGELMANN,--This cover has been addressed to you for a long\r\nwhile, but I have delayed to fill and close it, not so much because you\r\nhad not written, for I knew you must be very busy now, but because the\r\nconvenient time has not exactly come. For I have been very busy. College\r\nwork done up only last week; printing of “Exploring Expedition Botany,”\r\nin which I have read proofs up to 220 pages, and gave to-night finished\r\nmanuscript (except a few crooked points to settle in a family or two) up\r\nto the end of Rosaceæ (which will make about 450 pages. It fills up fast\r\nwith the open pages adopted in these reports). I shall carry on the\r\nvolume to 550 or 650 pages, and the plates folio, already 56, shall\r\ncarry up to 100, if I can. There is next some tough work in Myrtaceæ and\r\nMelastomaceæ; but as to the latter Naudin has much cleared the way.\r\nThose done, and I think I may venture to work part of the time on the\r\nLindheimer, Fendler, and Wright Monopetalæ.\r\n\r\nAgassiz returned most delighted with his visit to you, and we talked\r\nmuch of you....\r\n\r\nI am afraid to touch Gregg’s Mexican plants, for fear of the time they\r\nwould consume. In “Exploring Expedition,” I branch out little or none,\r\nexcept a few notes in Malvaceæ, and probably more in Compositæ.\r\n\r\nIf I could do the work abroad, I could work up collateral things most\r\nadvantageously; but the means here at disposal are too poor.\r\n\r\nStill, you will be pleased with my volume i. when I finish and send it\r\nto you (the letterpress this fall!).\r\n\r\nNo specimens scarcely of Cactaceæ in collection Exploring Expedition,--a\r\ndrawing or two. I shall send them on to you presently....\r\n\r\nI grieve to tell you that Adrien de Jussieu is dead. Cancer in the\r\nstomach, his tedious malady proves to have been. It makes a deep\r\nimpression on the scientific men, and the public, too, in Paris. He was\r\nmuch my most intimate correspondent in France, a true friend, and a\r\ncharming man.\r\n\r\nYou know, perhaps, that Moquin-Tandon has succeeded the late Achille\r\nRichard at L’Ecole de Médecine. Tulasne, I suppose, will be the new\r\nprofessor at the Jardin des Plantes; at least he ought to be, as he is\r\nthe most able man.\r\n\r\nNo farther news since my last.\r\n\r\nAgassiz looks poorly and says he is not well....\r\n\r\nI never could get Fouquiera up. To-day I have sown some seeds, and put\r\non my own table, by the window, to watch....\r\n\r\n18th August.\r\n\r\nAgassiz handed me your note about the Compass plant. I took him at once\r\ninto the Garden, to see Silphium laciniatum, terebinthinaceum, and\r\npinnatifidum.\r\n\r\nHe agreed there was no direction to be made out, one way more than\r\nanother. The cauline leaves all tend to become vertical (as in several\r\nother Compositæ), but present neither face nor edge north.\r\n\r\nBut three years ago Lapham of Wisconsin wrote me that, though the plant\r\nnear Milwaukee showed no “polarity” (and so he never believed in it),\r\nyet on going farther west, on the prairies, he found it did generally\r\nturn all to the north there.\r\n\r\nIf I remember aright, though, he said the surfaces of the leaf look\r\nnorth and south. You say the edges? How is this? Compare notes with\r\nLapham....\r\n\r\nWhat do you think I am about now? Revising genera of Myrtaceæ for\r\nExploring Expedition collection.\r\n\r\nIn these exotic orders I frequently find the genera so at loose ends\r\nthat I cannot make the plants of our collection lie comfortably till I\r\nhave given the genera a good shaking up. I should be tempted to do much\r\nmore of this if I could work at Hooker’s, or in Paris. It is quite as\r\nwell not, as it would cost no end of time....\r\n\r\nI have found some Fouquiera seedlings up in the Garden. I am right about\r\nit; not Torrey. The leaf is not axillary and its petiole inclosed in the\r\nspine; but the spine is a hardened inferior portion of the petiole that\r\npersists, and from which the rest falls away clean....\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, August 3, 1853.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,--I will endeavor to get some account of Shakerdom\r\nfor you. They are a queer people indeed.\r\n\r\nManilla paper[26] is made of old manilla rope, which is largely used by\r\nour shipping. But what plant yields the manilla hemp for this cordage I\r\nhave not the means of knowing, that is, whether the Musa textilis or no.\r\nI have been promised specimens of the stem of the plant, etc. But the\r\nclimate makes our countrymen indolent there, and forgetful. I will ask\r\nfor statistics as to the paper manufacture....\r\n\r\nI shall be pleased to have you figure as many of our ferns as you can;\r\nand pray give names to all new species without hesitation. They will be\r\nmore fitly named by the describer than by any one else.\r\n\r\nI note with satisfaction what you write about genera of ferns. This\r\npushing a single character (as venation) without regard to consequences,\r\nand giving it the same importance when it does not accord with habit as\r\nwhen it does, is the fault of most botanologists who restrict their view\r\nto one subject or one idea only. I am glad that you will carefully\r\nrevise the genera on your own judgment.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the fern I sent you last spring, and which you called\r\nAsplenium montanum, Willd. (a species I used to know well), struck the\r\ncollector (Beaumont), as it did me, to be different. Pray collate, and\r\nperhaps figure it, as well as the ordinary A. montanum.\r\n\r\nI was grieved to hear of the death of Adr. de Jussieu, with whom I have\r\nhad a very pleasant correspondence for the last three years, and to whom\r\nI was attached as to no other Frenchman. His late letters were so\r\ncheerful and lively, and even hopeful, that the news of his death took\r\nme by surprise, notwithstanding the steady failure of his health for a\r\nlong while....\r\n\r\nWe remember with interest that dear Harvey sets out to-morrow on his\r\nlong voyage.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nChristmas Eve, 1853.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. CHURCH,--It is a good time to remember old friends and to\r\nbring up, as well as one may, arrears of neglected duty. I have long\r\nunaccountably neglected to acknowledge your letter of the 24th August,\r\nand to thank you most heartily for the interesting volume of your\r\ncollected reviews, which reached me a little earlier (I know not how it\r\nwas so long delayed between New York and Cambridge), and which I have\r\nreceived and read with much pleasure, that is, all I have yet read. For\r\nI am saving the article on Dante for my first leisure hour. The first I\r\nread was the article on Pascal and Ultramontanism, of which I greatly\r\nadmire the delicate and thorough handling.\r\n\r\nI wish I could send you something of any interest. But I am not well\r\nenough satisfied with the elementary work which I use as a text-book for\r\nmy lower classes to offer it; and besides that I have published, since\r\nlast in England, only memoirs of the botany of our new western regions,\r\none volume of the botany of a Government South Sea Expedition, etc., all\r\ndreadfully dry and technical.\r\n\r\nI have been unusually busy this year, and am just now especially so,\r\nhaving to complete the preparation of nine lectures on Vegetation, which\r\nI am to give before the Smithsonian Institution at Washington next\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nI do not much fancy popular lecturing, and do this only to please a very\r\nvalued friend, Professor Henry, the secretary of this institution. This\r\nover, I shall return to my regular plodding work at home, with great\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nI do not wonder that you feel a little nervous about the result of the\r\nexperiment at Oxford. I can well understand it, and if I were an Oxford\r\nman, which I should count it a high honor to have been, I should share\r\nthe feeling. I count it an excellent thing that the new enactments were\r\nframed by friendly hands, and are not very sweeping. As far as I can\r\njudge from the election of the present council, those of the Movement\r\nparty by no means have it all their own way.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the admission of Dissenters to the A. B. degree is a\r\nwise measure, and one that will do no harm to the university nor the\r\nchurch. But I see not how they can go further. It would not be right\r\nthat they should pass to the A. M. and share in the government of the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nAny position at Oxford or Cambridge which allows of matrimony must be a\r\ndesirable one for a person of scholarly pursuits. I can hardly think you\r\nwill pass your life at Whatley, but trust you will have some better\r\npreferment and a wider field of duty before long, before Mrs. Gray and\r\nmyself will be likely to pay you the visit you kindly solicit, for I see\r\nno near prospect of our revisiting England, though nothing would please\r\nus more....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\n7th December, 1853.\r\n\r\nI got dreadfully behindhand with everything. “Exploring Expedition\r\nBotany” stopped printing for a long time, but is now renewed; three\r\nhundred or more pages are printed, and copy sent to printer up to\r\nLeguminosæ (excl.). Meanwhile, to look over Brackenridge’s manuscript of\r\nthe Filices, to turn a loose ungrammatical lingo into English, and his\r\nEnglish characters into Latin, is a tedious job; then to read his proofs\r\nis another. But if I did not do all this, very bad work indeed would be\r\nmade of it. Late in October Mrs. Gray and I went to New York for a week,\r\nto visit Torrey and to see the New York Exhibition. Returning, I had to\r\nbear my part in a course of lectures, which the American Academy gave to\r\nthe public (to replenish our publication funds); and to prepare and\r\ndeliver my two lectures, on the relations of plants to the sun, cost me\r\nalmost the whole of November.\r\n\r\nSprague is too slow, and too feeble in health, to do half what I want\r\ndone, let alone others. I must import an additional draughtsman. If you\r\nknow any in Germany good enough, who would come out, let me know at\r\nonce. If not, I must try at Paris....\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nMay 21, 1853.\r\n\r\nThe Kurile Islands will be a fine field; and I hope you can do much\r\namong them. Collect some specimens of everything you see there....\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 19, 1854.\r\n\r\nSinner that I am, I have four letters of yours unanswered; the last from\r\nSimon’s Bay, November 4th. The fact is I do not find time to write half\r\nthe letters I ought, and those, like yours, which are not to be\r\ndispatched on some particular day, I am sure to postpone and neglect\r\ninterminably. It seems so vague, too, to be writing to a man, you know\r\nnot where, somewhere on the other side of the world, and you know not\r\nwhen the epistle may reach him, say six months hence.\r\n\r\nNor is it easy to reflect and remember what I have been doing, so as to\r\ntell you....\r\n\r\nI forgot to tell you, too, that Thurber[27] called on me and offered his\r\nplants collected under Bartlett. I have written out the greater part up\r\nto the end of Compositæ, my old sticking-place, a number of new things,\r\nmostly from deeper down in Sonora than you went, and in southwest\r\nCalifornia. Beyond doubt Torrey will work up a part. I shall merely\r\nfurnish characters and botanical remarks to Thurber, and let him do all\r\nthe rest of the talk. Bartlett is still in hopes that the Senate will\r\nprint a great report for him. I greatly doubt if they do. If so,\r\nThurber’s botany will go as an appendix. If not, he will make a memoir\r\nof the things up to Compositæ, and the striking things beyond, and\r\nafterwards I may lick up the rest in the general continuation of “Plantæ\r\nWrightianæ,” etc.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the United States minister at Mexico has been making a treaty,\r\nnow before our Senate, for buying a further slice of Chihuahua and\r\nSonora, to take in Lake Guzman and the Sonora country some way south of\r\nwhere you went, that is, below San Pedro. So there will have to be a new\r\nsurvey if this treaty is ratified, and a chance of more botany. I wish\r\nyou were to be here to attend to it; only you have already taken off the\r\ncream of that country, and can now do more, and find more novelty, in\r\nsome of the countries you are going to.\r\n\r\nFrom Governor Stevens’s party, from Minnesota to Washington Territory,\r\nnorth of Oregon, bundles of plants are sent home to Baird and by him\r\nforwarded to me. Wretched specimens, and nothing new among them!...\r\n\r\nCaptains at sea are very apt to get a little crusty, which should be\r\nminded just as little as possible. I expect to hear that, after getting\r\nwell settled and at home in the Vincennes, you find yourself comfortable\r\nand all pleasant. Gentlemanly conduct and devotion to one’s pursuits\r\nwill at length make one respected, anywhere.\r\n\r\nWhen you return, I trust you will yourself prepare the botanical report\r\nof your cruise. I hope so, for your own sake, both scientifically and\r\nbecause your doing so will keep you on pay some years longer on shore. I\r\nwill aid you, if I live, most willingly over knotty points, etc.;\r\nperhaps would like to do certain families further than that; not, if you\r\nwill take hold of it yourself, as you ought to do.\r\n\r\nI suppose you will have found nothing new at the Cape, though the\r\nvegetation there must have been novel to you. It will be pleasant, in\r\nthe long cruises, to study yourself the plants collected at the last\r\nport. Did you get any nice Algæ? Look out for them hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhen you are on surveying-ground, you may probably be transferred back\r\nto the steamer again.\r\n\r\nPresently your letters will be coming to me via California. I hope to\r\ncontinue to hear such good accounts of your health and activity. Do not\r\nmeasure my interest in your letters by the number I myself write, though\r\nI mean to write oftener in future. No news here, scientific or other.\r\nMr. Carey, you know, has gone back to England to live, and has married a\r\nyoung wife there, moreover.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 28, 1854.\r\n\r\nI send a glass bottle filled with the pulp and seed of Cereus giganteus\r\nas gathered by the natives, and used for food, the same as what I\r\nformerly sent you a small quantity of in a letter, trusting the seeds\r\nwould grow, as they are not subjected to heat in making this jam.\r\n\r\nI have some pieces of the wood of the great Wellingtonia tree, which I\r\nestimate to be not older probably than the Christian era. Torrey has no\r\nfruit, nor have I; but there are some cones in Philadelphia. The wood is\r\nvery like that of the red-wood, i. e., Taxodium sempervirens. I hope we\r\nshall get the male flowers, but I have no correspondent in California,\r\nand Torrey no very good or energetic ones.\r\n\r\nHow hard it is to believe that there is a European war! I trust it will\r\nbe short. Some of our own people are behaving very badly about Cuba, but\r\nit is mostly talk for effect, and will lead to nothing, we hope.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE THURBER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 20th April, 1854.\r\n\r\nDEAR THURBER,--When yours of the 17th arrived, and till now, I have been\r\ntoo much absorbed in college duties to consider it, as I now rapidly\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nRanunculus 441. I never liked naming a plant after a person who has had\r\nnothing to do with it, as collector, describer, and nothing else;\r\ntherefore do not like R. Huntiana. We will wait for some other mode of\r\ncomplimenting Mr. Hunt. Moreover, I have hit on a name which pleases me\r\ntolerably, viz., R. hydrocharoides, which, by your leave, we will adopt.\r\n\r\nThurberia specific name? That is a question to consider, and no very\r\npat name at once applicable both to the species and the discoverer\r\noccurs to me.\r\n\r\n“Thurberia palmata” might pass, and would anglicize into “the handy\r\nThurber,” but then the hand has only three fingers.\r\n\r\n“T. tridactyla” would meet this; but only birds are tridactylous;\r\nbesides, the uppermost leaves are entire.\r\n\r\nTaking another tack, from its smoothness, we might say, T. glabra or T.\r\nlævis; or, as I believe you have not a strong beard, T. imberbis. But,\r\non the whole, perhaps it would be as well to indicate merely the nearest\r\naffinity of the genus, and call it “Thurberia thespesioides,” as it is\r\nnearest Thespesia. Take your choice, though, of any of the above, to\r\nwhich add “T. rosea,” if the color of the flower warrants that name.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 1, 1854.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--It was with great pleasure that I received from you,\r\ntwo days ago, your letter of the 2d May. I counted myself your debtor,\r\nalthough, indeed, my last letter of 18th October is of later date than\r\nyours of the 1st October, which it crossed on the ocean, and I was only\r\nwaiting until I could announce a small envoi to you, namely, that of a\r\ncopy of the 1st volume of the “Botany of the United States Exploring\r\nExpedition in the South Seas,” which has been more than a year in\r\nprinting. This 4th volume (777 pages) is at length happily printed off,\r\nand just in time, too, for sending you a copy (unbound, direct from the\r\nprinting-office at Philadelphia) in the annual envoi of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\nThe atlas, of 100 plates in folio, which should accompany this volume,\r\nis by no means ready, owing to the slowness as well as the feeble\r\nhealth of the artist, Mr. Sprague; perhaps, even, it may not reach you\r\nbefore next year, by the same mode of conveyance.\r\n\r\nI have now, indeed, some hopes that the “Flora of North America” may\r\nsoon be carried through the Gamopetalæ, I elaborating at the same time,\r\nin a general memoir, the Gamopetalæ of Wright’s, Fendler’s, and\r\nLindheimer’s collections in continuation; a pretty formidable matter!\r\n\r\nIn a separate small parcel you will find (in the Smithsonian envoi) some\r\nbrochures for you.... Among them is a short article in “Silliman’s\r\nJournal,” accompanying a reprint of a great part of Dr. Hooker’s\r\nIntroductory Essay to the “Flora of New Zealand.” Agassiz here is\r\ncommitted to the view opposite to Hooker’s, in an equally extreme form.\r\nI wished to interpose some criticisms to both views, but had only time\r\nto touch briefly on one or two points. I wait with impatience for your\r\nwork on “Géographie Botanique,” expecting very much from it, from your\r\ngreat ability, long study of the subject, and fairness of mind. Indeed,\r\nI was daily expecting to learn that it was published; and now you tell\r\nme that the printing is barely begun; the “Prodromus,” volume 14, not\r\nyet begun! But I am one of the last persons who ought to complain of\r\ndelay in execution....\r\n\r\nFrom the family of the late M. de Jussieu, you should receive a copy of\r\nthe “Epistolæ Linnæano-Jussieuanæ,” with our late friend’s notes, etc.,\r\nthe last scientific work of his too short life.[28] I intended to send\r\nyou a copy myself, but at the request of M. Ramond I surrendered the\r\nsmall extra edition to his charge for distribution. In due time you will\r\nhave a copy in the volume of the “Memoirs of the American Academy” also.\r\nMy daguerreotype of M. Jussieu was most opportunely taken. His family,\r\nhaving no recent portrait, have solicited the loan of it, to aid in the\r\npreparation of an engraved likeness; and I have placed it in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nI delayed the last sheet of the “Correspondence” long, awaiting an\r\nanswer to my request for some materials (notices, éloges, etc.), from\r\nwhich I could prepare something of a biographical nature to append, but\r\nI received nothing, at least until too late. In the May number of the\r\n“Kew Journal of Botany,” Hooker has reprinted my brief note; but by some\r\naccident, the marks of quotation are omitted from the two last\r\nparagraphs, which appear as if written by the editor of the “Journal.”\r\n...\r\n\r\nBelieve me to remain, my dear friend and honored colleague, as ever,\r\nyour sincerely attached,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 5, 1855.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,--The inclosed, from our good friend Dr. Short,[29]\r\nand the box it advises, came while I was at Washington, from which I\r\nhave just returned. Mrs. Gray and I have enjoyed our month’s holiday\r\nvery much; though I was kept busy enough, having to deliver nine\r\nlectures in three weeks. We had arranged to have a few days at New York,\r\nin which I could work with Dr. Torrey; but the good man was called off\r\nto Washington on business just as I left that place, and we crossed en\r\nroute, and I came on home, in consequence....\r\n\r\nI am very glad Mr. Smith was pleased with the live plants I sent. Please\r\nremind him that I should like to share in the distribution of seeds this\r\nspring. And if I find time to make out a short list, I may ask for some\r\nlive plants again....\r\n\r\nI have a Cereus giganteus six inches high, and I saw several others.\r\nThey have no hair, and appear very unlike C. senilis....\r\n\r\nThere is an authentic account in some numbers of “Silliman’s\r\nJournal” last year of the size of that prostrate trunk\r\n(Wellingtonia-Washingtonia).\r\n\r\nMr. Blake, at Washington, told me something of it, but I forget the\r\nnumbers. I will ask him, as he is a reliable person. But 450 feet is\r\nrather too tall.\r\n\r\nSo they would talk about the tree that was felled being 3,000 years old\r\n(and took in Lindley), whereas it was not quite 1,300! It appears to\r\ngrow much faster than S. sempervirens.[30] ...\r\n\r\nA great loss in Forbes’s death. I have been trembling lest I should hear\r\nthat Dr. Hooker is chosen to the chair at Edinburgh, which would give\r\nhim very good pay, I suppose, and he would fill the place well, but it\r\nwould take him away from special botany, which would be a great pity....\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nMay 29, 1855.\r\n\r\nThe class which leaves college this summer have bespoken photographic\r\nlikenesses, on paper, of their professors,--my colleagues and\r\nmyself,--and this gives me an opportunity of obtaining from the artist\r\nsome duplicate copies of that for which I sat, and which Mrs. Gray\r\npronounces a very good likeness.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much vanity that induces me to ask you to accept of the\r\ncopy I inclose, as the hope of getting yours in return, if that same\r\nstyle be adopted in Geneva, and be as little expensive as here,--to add\r\nto the already considerable number of portraits of botanists which make\r\nthe chief adornment of my rooms,--among which the fine engraving of your\r\ndistinguished father is conspicuous. I need not say that I should be\r\nglad to place the likeness of the son near to that of the father. Ever,\r\nmy dear De Candolle,\r\n\r\nYour sincere and faithful,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nAugust 28, 1855.\r\n\r\nFor a long while now I have been waiting for a good evening when I was\r\nnot too tired to write you a long letter to meet you in California, in\r\nreturn, though a poor return, for your several nice letters from China.\r\n\r\nIt is now time my letter was off,--when lo and behold!--\r\n\r\nYesterday morning I was sitting here busy with steady work and not\r\nexpecting much interruption; now, this evening, my passage is taken, my\r\ntrunk packed, I am hurriedly closing up affairs, and to-morrow morning\r\ngo on board steamer America and sail for Liverpool. I have to go and\r\nlook after my brother-in-law, who is sick in Paris of a fever. No one of\r\nthe family can go but me, and I manage to find the time. Mr. Loring pays\r\nthe traveling charges, and off I go, to be gone, however, not over two\r\nmonths, perhaps not so long; a week in Paris, another at Kew, a few days\r\nmore in England; this must repay me (besides the consciousness of having\r\ndone my duty) for some twenty odd days of discomfort at sea!\r\n\r\nWhat have I been doing of late? Not much accomplished, i. e., published.\r\nOf my “Plantæ Novæ Thurberianæ” and “Notes on Vavæa and Rhytidandra” I\r\nhave sent you copies already, but I will send you more.\r\n\r\nA useful article on the Smithsonian Institution, in July number of\r\n“Silliman,” probably you have seen in the “Journal;” never mind, I send\r\nyou a separate copy by mail. Some critical notices which I have no\r\ncopies of.\r\n\r\nWhat I am about doing, I can always talk largely of. I am preparing a\r\nnew edition of the “Manual of Botany of the Northern United States,” and\r\na new elementary work[31] of a familiar character, to go with it,\r\nseparate and with original pictures on wood by Sprague, and I am to\r\nfinish the “Flora” volume and “Plantæ Wrightianæ” with it. I have\r\ndetermined Berlandier’s plants up to end of Compositæ. Also I have\r\ndone, along with Torrey, the botany of several expeditions across the\r\ncontinent for railroad surveys, which are soon to be published. Work\r\ngoes slowly and I grow old. This little holiday will not be a bad thing\r\nfor me, though it puts me back a little.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 23, 1855.\r\n\r\nNow that I am quietly settled at home again, my episode seems almost\r\nlike a dream,--a very pleasant one, however, since it gave me the\r\npleasure of seeing once more some most valued and near friends. I was\r\nabsent only six weeks and one day, of which twenty-two days were passed\r\nupon the water.\r\n\r\nI found all well here on my return, but I was deeply grieved to learn\r\nthe news of our beloved friend Dr. Torrey’s bereavement. It was about a\r\nmonth ago that the companion of his life, almost from his youth, was\r\nremoved to a better world, after an illness of only a few days.... She\r\nwas one of the most actively good, self-denying persons I ever knew.\r\nThere are many to mourn at her departure out of her own family,\r\nespecially among the poor and the distressed.... She was one of my\r\nearliest and best friends, one to whom I owe more than to almost any\r\nperson; and I feel the loss as I should that of a near and dear\r\nrelative.\r\n\r\nI wrote you a line, with some inclosures, while at sea, and posted it at\r\nHalifax, N. S....\r\n\r\nWhen I send the package from Holton,[32] I wish also to send you live\r\nseedlings of a palm from Sonora, Mexico, raised from seeds gathered by\r\nThurber, and one or two other things.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the large “cypress knees” I promised, which will be\r\nrather striking in your famous museum, and I look out for an opportunity\r\nto send by sailing vessel direct to London.\r\n\r\nRemember me affectionately to Lady Hooker (for whom Mrs. Gray incloses a\r\nfew lines) and most cordially to Mr. Bentham, who so kindly came down\r\nfrom the country to give me the opportunity of seeing him, for which I\r\nam greatly obliged.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I forgot to tell you that, by the hands of Hon. Miss Murray (who\r\nreturns to England by this week’s steamer), I send you the September\r\nnumber of “Silliman’s Journal.” Should she forget to send it to you,\r\nplease remind her when she comes to Kew, as assuredly she will, to talk\r\nabout her Florida new fern. I have filled up the Ward case which she\r\nbrought over, also a box of American plants which she takes, I suppose,\r\nfor Mr. Fox Strangways. Her various boxes and packages will nearly fill\r\nthe ship, I should think.\r\n\r\nMiss Murray is a most lively, most active person, has traveled widely\r\nthrough the country, and traversed rough places, such as no other woman\r\npast sixty ever did. She has seen a great deal, but heard very little, I\r\nshould think, as she talks incessantly, and in a lively, interesting\r\nway, too.\r\n\r\nYou will not be disappointed by the suppression of her manuscript by her\r\nEnglish friends, I suppose, for she is fully determined to rush into\r\nprint, to print her journal just as it was written from day to day; for\r\nshe now feels she has a mission to rescue the South from the obloquy\r\nand wrong heaped upon it by us of the North, and by England. Save the\r\nmark!\r\n\r\nAt any rate, her journal will be piquant.\r\n\r\nI am anxious to know how far we can economically use the post for the\r\ntransmission of printed matter. Perhaps I could safely send you\r\n“Silliman’s Journal” in this way. As an experiment I now send you our\r\nUniversity catalogue. No, it will not do, I see, for anything weighing\r\nover two ounces or three. Beyond this the rates increase woefully....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\n18th October, 1855.\r\n\r\nYours of August 30th (answered by my wife) was written when I was one\r\nday at sea. Yours of October 13, which arrived to-day, was written two\r\ndays after I reached home again. I had two very pleasant voyages, on the\r\nwhole, and not long, ten and a half and eleven and a half days; eleven\r\ndays in Paris (where I was detained a little by a severe cold on my\r\nlungs) and a week in England, mostly at London and Kew. I found my\r\nbrother-in-law so convalescent that I might have stayed at home, and I\r\nbrought him home with me in good condition. We had hoped, till the last\r\nmoment, to get places in the steamer of the 13th October, and to have\r\nhad a fortnight more in England. But all the places had been engaged for\r\nmonths, and nobody was giving up berths up to the time we sailed; so we\r\nhad to come in steamer of the 29th ult., where we got a good stateroom\r\nby great luck, though the vessel was greatly crowded. Dr. Joseph D.\r\nHooker (whom I had wanted to see for some time) being away in Germany,\r\nand time being extremely valuable to me here, I was on the whole very\r\nglad to get home. The naturalists at Paris were en vacance, and mostly\r\naway. I saw only Brongniart, Spach, Gay, Dr. Montagne, and Trécul (who\r\nsent, I believe, some pamphlets for you; the package is not yet\r\nunpacked), and my good friend Vilmorin. Boissier was there from Geneva.\r\n\r\nIn England I spent all the little time I could command at dear Hooker’s\r\nat Kew; and Bentham, then in the country, came down to see me. I made a\r\nlong and interesting call on Robert Brown, who is very old, but full of\r\ninterest. I shall not again see this Nestor of botanists, as well as\r\nfacile princeps, in this world.\r\n\r\nHooker was much delighted when I told him you were coming next spring to\r\nsee him at Kew. He insisted upon taking me over to see the Cactus house,\r\nand all through it, so that I might tell you what a mass of Cacteæ there\r\nare there; and he will be much pleased to have you work among them. He\r\nspoke about his Cuscuteæ, but was not at all displeased at your\r\nretaining them; begged you would work them up if possible before\r\nreturning them. You will be charmed with Sir William when you see him.\r\n\r\nAs to the “Manual,” my plan, as at present advised, is to cross the line\r\nof slavery a little, to take in Kentucky and Virginia; this makes the\r\nreal division, in botanical geography, between North and South. It\r\nshould be Northern ground, too, down to this line: for north of it slave\r\nlabor is good for nothing; and there would be no slaves there, except\r\nfor the Southern market. I cannot take in Missouri, for I must make the\r\nMississippi my boundary. But all your St. Louis plants cross into\r\nIllinois, do they not? Tell me how this is. I shall get at work at the\r\nnew edition soon. I shall first press on the “Lessons” a little\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nAbout Fouquiera; I have examined it here repeatedly on the live plant,\r\nwhich every year prolongs its main axis an inch or two. And I took\r\nleaves to Providence to show there, especially to remove any lingering\r\ndoubt on Torrey’s mind. For Torrey would long have it that the spine was\r\na primary leaf, and that an axillary leaf adhered to it by its petiole.\r\nHe now knows better.\r\n\r\nI just saw Agassiz. He looks well and strong....\r\n\r\nI read Alphonse De Candolle’s “Géographie Botanique Raisonnée” on the\r\nvoyage home: a most able work it is, full of interesting matter very\r\nmethodically arranged. Hooker and Thomson’s “Flora Indica,” vol. i., is\r\nfamous for its able introductory essay, etc.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nOctober 27, 1855.\r\n\r\nYour welcome letter of the 7th of August duly reached me. I meant to\r\nhave surprised you by an answer dated at Paris; but the eleven days I\r\npassed there were too busily occupied to allow it. M. Boissier will have\r\ntold you of my sudden voyage, and the cause of it. I was absent from\r\nhome only six weeks and a day; and twenty-two days of the forty-three\r\nwere passed on the water. On returning home I found here:\r\n\r\n1. The excellent lithographed portrait of yourself, a pleasing and\r\npretty good likeness. Of the three copies I have offered one to Torrey,\r\nthe other to Short.\r\n\r\n2. The copy of “Géographie Botanique,” which you so kindly addressed to\r\nme. (I have already learned that Agassiz and Darlington have theirs; but\r\nTorrey not his, and I have directed inquiries to be made.) This was not\r\nmy first introduction to the book; for I bought a copy of Masson in\r\nParis, to read on the voyage, when I could have more leisure than at\r\nhome. And I carefully read it then (after having dispatched Hooker and\r\nThomson’s “Flora Indica”) up as far as to p. 1087, when I was obliged by\r\nthe close of the voyage to break off, at a very interesting point; and I\r\ncannot yet resume the reading.\r\n\r\nI cannot sufficiently express my profound admiration of this book, so\r\nthorough and conscientious, so capital in its method, and embodying such\r\na vast amount of facts well discussed; it might well be the work of a\r\nlong life. I have marked in many places points on which I may have a\r\nword to say, sometimes little details to add or correct, sometimes a\r\ncriticism to hazard.\r\n\r\nIf time (which is now precious to me) permit, I will write a series of\r\narticles on it for “Silliman’s Journal,” which will serve to make the\r\nwork generally known to our people, and in which I can insert any\r\ncommentaries I have time and room for. One article I will devote to\r\nplants introduced into this country from Europe. Now that you have so\r\nwell collected and digested the principal information, it will be easy\r\nto complete and correct some points; and this may be useful to you\r\nhereafter, as well as to me....\r\n\r\nI will procure from Dr. Harris any information he has collected about\r\nthe potato, which, if Raleigh took it from Virginia to England, must\r\nhave been brought to Virginia from South America. It was certainly\r\nunknown to our aborigines, who, however, along with maize, cultivated\r\nbeans (Phaseoli) and squashes (Cucurbitæ).\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker had written to me, eulogizing your work in the highest terms.\r\nI missed seeing him when in England.\r\n\r\nAgassiz speaks most highly of it; but I think he has only looked rapidly\r\nthrough its pages as yet....\r\n\r\nI am at this moment preparing to begin the printing of the 2d edition of\r\nmy “Manual of the Botany of the Northern States.” ...\r\n\r\nIn consequence of your book, I shall take pains to classify the\r\nintroduced plants, according to the degree of naturalization, etc.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for sending me your portrait. I am already quite rich in the\r\nlikenesses of botanists, many of which adorn the walls of my\r\napartments....\r\n\r\nBelieve me to remain, my dear friend, yours very faithfully and truly,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 25, 1856.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,--Holton is bringing out a book upon New Granada\r\nwhich will be interesting....\r\n\r\nThe cypress knee sent was the best and handsomest I had, though not the\r\nlargest. I am glad it pleases you. But you mistook what I said, or meant\r\nto say, which was, that tucked away in the hollow you would find placed\r\na specimen of a forming knee, not much bigger than your knuckle, on a\r\npiece of root a foot or so long. Was this overlooked or lost? Please\r\ntell me; for I can replace it with another, and physiologically it would\r\nbe well to show the formation in its various stages....\r\n\r\nI want to send you a book by a young friend of ours, Olmsted, on the\r\nseaboard slave States,[33] an admirable volume, full of information, and\r\nlively withal. I wait for an opportunity. Lady Hooker will be\r\ninterested in it. Our united warm regards to her.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Duke for anything to facilitate transmission of printed\r\nmatter. But it is still high; for example, your “Journal,” which I get\r\nby post, costs 6d. each number, paid in London, and about 1d. more paid\r\nhere. There is still room for improvement. I dare not send you\r\n“Silliman’s Journal” yet by post.\r\n\r\nJune 30, 1856.\r\n\r\nCharles Wright, who was in the North Pacific Expedition under Ringgold\r\nand Rogers, has left his ship at California instead of making the voyage\r\nround Cape Horn, and crossed over the Nicaragua route, intending to\r\nbotanize there some months. Finding himself there among our vile\r\nfilibustering people, and all in confusion, however, he was soon obliged\r\nto come on home. He is awaiting the arrival of his ship, and will not\r\ntill this autumn be able to touch his Pacific collections, of which the\r\nbest and principal were made in Hongkong, Bonin, and the Loo Choo\r\nIslands and Japan. That they are not larger is not his fault.\r\n\r\nWright has a perfect passion for collecting plants; and already begins\r\nto plan other explorations. To satisfy his cravings for a while, I have\r\nproposed to him to go to St. Iago de Cuba, and explore that end of the\r\nisland. What do you think of it? Has any botanist collected there? Would\r\nit be too like Jamaica to offer much novelty? But to return. In\r\nNicaragua, Wright collected a goodly quantity of seeds, one set of which\r\nhe wishes me to send to you; a present to Kew Gardens, as I understand\r\nit....\r\n\r\nBy the way, it was most lucky that I hurried up and had sent on to you\r\nthe copy of Brackenridge’s “Filices;” for a fire in Philadelphia has\r\nconsumed all of the poor fellow’s edition of the volume except ten\r\ncopies which had been sold mostly in Europe. A sad and a heavy loss to\r\nB., who had no insurance, and something to me who had advanced to him\r\nthe paper for printing it on, which now the poor fellow is in no\r\ncondition to pay for. I have not even a copy of the atlas myself, but I\r\nshall get one from the government plates, which are preserved.\r\nBrackenridge utterly despairs of reprinting it. But possibly the\r\ngovernment will set up the type for him again, as they have also lost a\r\npart of their small impression. Otherwise the book will have the value\r\nof excessive rarity, if it has no other....\r\n\r\nMay 25, 1857.\r\n\r\nI hear with delight that you are meditating a trip to America, and I\r\nwrite forthwith to express my own and Mrs. Gray’s and my good\r\nfather-in-law’s earnest hope that you will come over, even if it be for\r\na few weeks only. The rest of the voyage cannot but be useful to so busy\r\na person as you constantly are, and a run through the country, and a\r\nsight of the Yankee world, would interest you. At the Montreal\r\nscientific meeting you would see several old friends and many new ones.\r\nTorrey, Greene, Darlington,[34] James,[35] etc., would be half frantic\r\nwith pleasure at the thought of seeing you; so it will not do to hint at\r\nsuch a thing, until you give me authority; and as for my wife and me,\r\nwe will look after you like dutiful children, will go with you to\r\nNiagara, or to Lake Superior, if you will go so far, for there is\r\nnothing would give us so much pleasure as a visit from you; and if you\r\nwould bring Lady Hooker or Mrs. Evans, or both, with you, it would be\r\ncharming. The voyage is nothing to speak of, traveling here is easy and\r\nrapid, although not so very comfortable, as in England, and a good deal\r\nof the country can be seen in a few weeks without much fatigue. Pray do\r\ncome, and exceedingly gratify,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate and faithful\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO JAMES D. DANA.\r\n\r\nDecember 13, 1856.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DANA,--I duly received the sheets I asked for.\r\n\r\nThe right way to bring a series of pretty interesting general questions\r\ntowards settlement is perhaps in hand (though I do not expect myself to\r\nbring anything important to bear on it), viz., for a number of totally\r\nindependent naturalists, of widely different pursuits and antecedents,\r\nto environ it on all sides, work towards a common centre, but each to\r\nwork perfectly independently. Such men as Darwin, Dr. Hooker, De\r\nCandolle, Agassiz, and myself,--most of them with no theory they are\r\nbound to support,--ought only to bring out some good results. And the\r\nless each one is influenced by the other’s mode of viewing things the\r\nbetter. For my part, in respect to the bearings of the distribution of\r\nplants, etc., I am determined to know no theory, but to see what the\r\nfacts tend to show, when fairly treated.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of species, their nature, distribution, what system in\r\nnatural history is, etc., certain inferences are slowly settling\r\nthemselves in my mind, or taking shape; but on some of the most vexed\r\nquestions I have as yet no opinion whatever, and no very strong bias,\r\nthanks, partly, to the fact that I can think of and investigate such\r\nmatters only now and then, and in a very desultory way.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I believe in centres of radiation for groups of\r\nspecies. From Darwin’s questions to me I think I perceive some of the\r\ngrounds on which he would maintain it. One is attended to on page 77 of\r\nthe January number [of “Silliman’s Journal”], but I am not clear that\r\nthey are not just as susceptible of other interpretation.\r\n\r\nBut as to a centre of radiation for each separate species, I must say I\r\nhave a bias that way. You seem to have also, and you can best judge\r\nwhether this, combined with geological considerations, would not involve\r\ncentres of radiation for groups of species as well, to a certain extent.\r\nWould not the fact that the members of peculiar groups (in Vegetable\r\nKingdom) are to a great extent localized favor that view?\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that your idea of the unity of the human species is\r\nconfirmed more and more. The evidence seems to me most strongly to favor\r\nit. And you well discriminate the separate questions of unity of\r\nbirthplace and unity of parentage....\r\n\r\nAs to the physical question, surely you do not suppose that, in a fresh\r\nrace, the one or two necessary close intermarriages would sensibly\r\ndeteriorate the stock. Look at domestic animals of peculiar races,--how\r\nlong you can breed in and in without much abatement of health or vigor!\r\n\r\nDid you ever consider the question of the cause of deterioration from\r\ninterbreeding?\r\n\r\nI think I have somewhere in the “Journal” stated my notion about it, or\r\nhinted at it. If not, I will, some day; for I have a pretty decided\r\nopinion about it: that hereditary transmission of individual\r\npeculiarities involves also, among them, the transmission of disease, or\r\ntendency to disease,--a constantly increasing heritage of liability as\r\ninterbreeding goes on; in plants well exemplified by maladies affecting\r\nold cultivated varieties long propagated by division.\r\n\r\nI should much enjoy a visit with you at New Haven, and so would my wife,\r\nno less. Hope we may some day....\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nMarch 26, 1857.\r\n\r\nFendler is back again in the country of Venezuela, and making fine\r\ncollections. He will complete the sets of his former distribution, but\r\nnot send the same things over again. He has found many more Filices.\r\nWill you and M. Dunant continue?\r\n\r\nOn Wright’s return home he was troubled with rheumatism, and longed for\r\na warm climate to pass the winter in. So I sent him to the east end of\r\nCuba (where I wished the Huets to go). He is doing very well there.\r\n\r\nOregon is still in a disturbed and unsafe state. But I should inform you\r\nthat a commission has been raised to run our northwestern boundary with\r\nthe British government; and it will probably be commenced this year. The\r\nparty would have a sufficient escort, and this would give the Huets a\r\nsafe opportunity for botanizing across the continent in a high latitude,\r\nif they are so disposed. I know not any details, but I could learn\r\nthem, if need be, and there would be no difficulty in procuring needful\r\nprotection for the Huets, they finding their own subsistence.\r\n\r\nI have published two statistical articles, based on my “Botany of the\r\nNorthern States,” in “Silliman’s Journal,” and a third is now printing\r\nin that journal for May. I shall have extra copies to send you. There\r\nare other topics I mean to take up, if I can find time....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nMay 4, 1857.\r\n\r\nSince your letter came I have looked up and read the article in the\r\n“Edinburgh,” and like it much. Your few words about Genera, page 517,\r\nappear to comprise the gist of the whole matter. As to your fuller\r\nexposition, not being able to lay hands on the “Literary Gazette,” I\r\nwait to see your article in the “Journal of the Linnæan Society.”\r\n\r\nI am particularly interested in what you write of your popular “British\r\nFlora,” and the English names; and I am going to ask you to explain to\r\nme more fully the principles on which you proceed. For, if practicable,\r\nI am going to have occasion to do something of the sort here. Pray\r\nillustrate your plan a little; as I see much difficulty in carrying it\r\nout, except in so small a flora as the British, where every plant has a\r\npopular name. One additional difficulty here is that our common English\r\nnames are mostly misapplied ones, and the plants that have indigenous\r\ntrivial names have too many of them, varying in different parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHow do you name the orders? What relation will you have between your\r\nspecific names and your generic, and how many words will you allow each\r\nto consist of?\r\n\r\nGive me your names through some family, say Ranunculaceæ. If I can see\r\nmy way clear, I shall follow your lead, or cause it to be followed on an\r\noccasion which will soon be presented.\r\n\r\nI wish I had known of Clitoria Mariana-acuminata, etc., in time to add\r\nit to my list in the last number of “Silliman’s Journal;” a copy of the\r\narticle was sent to Dr. Hooker by post last week. I will send more, from\r\nmy extras, presently.\r\n\r\nI am quite prepared for what you say about interchange of species of\r\nUnited States and Europe taking place via Asia, instead of across the\r\nAtlantic; but you will see there are a few, besides aquatics (Subularia,\r\nEriocaulon, etc.), which would seem to have taken the shorter cut.\r\n\r\nAs respects identical species, interchange is the only thing that, on\r\nour views of what a species is, will explain the occurrence of the same\r\nspecies here and there. But as to genera, I do not yet feel free to\r\nassume an interchange, or a former continuity of land, between two\r\nwidely separated regions on account of their having identical genera or\r\nclosely related species. I see no reason why cognate species may not\r\nhave been originally given to most widely separated stations; and, as to\r\nthe facts of association, can we say more than this, that the species of\r\na genus are apt to be confined to one part of the world? Are there not\r\ntoo many cases to the contrary to warrant our suspecting former\r\ncontinuity of two remote districts on account of common genera? Peculiar\r\ngenera, such as Torreya, Illicium, Philadelphus, Astilbe, etc., divided\r\nbetween Japan and the United States of America, indicate some peculiar\r\nrelation, and are most noteworthy, but I do not see why it points to\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nI am very glad you are turning your good, logical mind and immense\r\nknowledge to this class of topics; but do not let it run off with too\r\nmuch of your valuable time. I take far more satisfaction in discussing\r\nquestions of botanical affinity; and long to get back to that sort of\r\nwork. Just now, I must needs be absorbed in elementary work and\r\nteaching, but look to see an end of this.\r\n\r\nI have been watching the development of the ovules of Magnolia; nothing\r\ncan be more normal than they are, in the early stages.\r\n\r\nWhen Wright comes home from Cuba I expect to get hold of his\r\nconsiderable north Japan collection, which I expect to find very\r\ninteresting on questions of distribution, the very questions you ask me\r\nto consider.\r\n\r\nI doubt if our “mountain backbone” actually stops any species, itself,\r\nfrom advancing east or west.\r\n\r\nI wish you would compare our White Birch with the European B. alba, and\r\nlet me know the result. Also the Chestnuts....\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, May 15, 1857.\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance en route for Scotland has offered to take some small\r\nparcels for me.\r\n\r\nAmong them is one I have taken the liberty to address to you, a copy of\r\na very elementary book[36] I have prepared as an introduction to my\r\nfavorite science, finding there was no one in use here which I thought\r\nfit to put into the hands of young beginners. Here botany is taught,\r\nsomehow or other, in most schools, and generally by incompetent teachers\r\nfrom wretched books, i. e., those used in the ordinary schools and for\r\nyoung people.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored, in the little book I send you, to make real science\r\nas easy and simple as possible. I doubt if I have yet aimed low enough;\r\nbut the book seems to take, and promises to be useful.\r\n\r\nAlthough not adapted for your meridian (where you have doubtless good\r\nelementary books enough), yet when your boy, who must now be five or six\r\nyears old, if he has been spared to you, gets a few years older, I shall\r\nbe much gratified if this little volume should interest him, and aid you\r\nsomewhat in developing in his mind a love for the study of nature in one\r\nof its pleasantest branches....\r\n\r\nI want to offer you my new “Manual of the Botany of the Northern United\r\nStates,” not that it can be of any use or of much interest to you, but\r\nmust not load my kind acquaintance with more parcels. I wait for an\r\nopportunity of sending through the booksellers, before long.\r\n\r\nTO JAMES D. DANA.\r\n\r\nNovember 7, 1857.\r\n\r\nIf you have plenty, please send me two more copies of your “Thoughts on\r\nSpecies.”\r\n\r\nI first read it carefully, a week ago, and I meant to write you at once\r\nhow I like it, and a few remarks, but something prevented at the time,\r\nand I have been very busy and preoccupied ever since.\r\n\r\nFor the reason that I like the general doctrine, and wish to see it\r\nestablished, so much the more I am bound to try all the steps of the\r\nreasoning, and the facts it rests on, impartially, and even to suggest\r\nall the adverse criticism I can think of. When I read the pamphlet I\r\njotted down on the margin some notes of what struck me at the time. I\r\nwill glance at them again, and see if, on reflection, they appear likely\r\nto be of the least use to you, and if so will send them, taking it for\r\ngranted that you rather like to be criticised, as I am sure I do, when\r\nthe object is the surer establishment of truth.\r\n\r\nIn your idea of species as specific amount or kind of concentrated\r\nforce, you fall back upon the broadest and most fundamental views, and\r\ndevelop it, it seems to me, with great ability and cogency.\r\n\r\nTaking the cue of species, if I may so say, from the inorganic, you\r\ndevelop the subject to great advantage for your view, and all you say\r\nmust have great weight, in “reasoning from the general.”\r\n\r\nBut in reasoning from inorganic species to organic species, and in\r\nmaking it tell where you want it and for what you want it to tell, you\r\nmust be sure that you are using the word “species” in the same sense in\r\nthe two, that the one is really an equivalent of the other. That is what\r\nI am not yet convinced of. And so to me the argument comes only with the\r\nforce of an analogy, whereas I suppose you want it to come as\r\ndemonstration. Very likely you could convince me that there is no\r\nfallacy in reasoning from the one to the other to the extent you do. But\r\nall my experience makes me cautious and slow about building too much\r\nupon analogies; and until I see further and clearer, I must continue to\r\nthink that there is an essential difference between kinds of animals or\r\nplants and kinds of matter. How far we may safely reason from the one\r\nto the other is the question. If we may do so even as far as you do,\r\nmight not Agassiz (at least plausibly) say, that as the species Iron was\r\ncreated in a vast number of individuals over the whole earth, so the\r\npresumption is that any given species of plants or animals was\r\noriginated in as many individuals as there are now, and over as wide an\r\narea, the human species under as great diversities as it now has\r\n(barring historical intermixture)?--so reducing the question between you\r\nto insignificance, because then the question whether men are of one or\r\nof several species would no longer be a question of fact, or of much\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nYou can answer him from another starting-point, no doubt; but he may\r\nstill insist that it is a legitimate carrying out of your own\r\nprinciple....\r\n\r\nThe tendency of my mind is opposed to this sort of view; but you may be\r\nsure that before long there must be one more resurrection of the\r\ndevelopment theory in a new form, obviating many of the arguments\r\nagainst it, and presenting a more respectable and more formidable\r\nappearance than it ever has before....\r\n\r\nI wanted to say something on the last two pages, but as I have nothing\r\nin particular to except to, and much to approve, and as it is late\r\nbedtime, I spare you further comments.\r\n\r\nI set out to find flaws, as likely to be more suggestive and therefore\r\nfar more useful to you than any amount of praise, with which I could\r\nfill page after page.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 6, 1857.\r\n\r\nYour first letter is now gone to Sullivant, because you speak of him so\r\nhandsomely, and say that Mitten is instructed to prepare a set of Mosses\r\nfor him. A noble fellow is Sullivant and deserves all you say of him and\r\nhis works. The more you get to know of him the better you will like him.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about my “Manual of the Botany of the Northern United\r\nStates.” It was quite impossible, of course, that the publishers should\r\nprovide such illustrations as the fourteen plates and keep the book at a\r\nsalable price, so Sullivant, on his own motion, had the eight plates of\r\nMusci engraved in copper, at his own cost, for $630 (about £126), and\r\ngave them to the work, after printing 250 copies for his separate\r\nbooklet I sent you. I gave the six plates of Ferns, etc., cut on stone\r\nby Sprague to complete the plan. In the “Journal” you are wrong in\r\nsupposing that the Musci were even drawn by Sprague. If in time please\r\ncorrect this when you notice his book. Sullivant drew them all with his\r\nown hands (as he did those of former memoirs which pleased you well),\r\nand had them copied and reduced to proper size by a German artist he\r\nemploys. So that besides his labor, he has expended at least £180 in\r\nmoney, on these plates. They were executed on copper by a young engraver\r\nin Boston.\r\n\r\nYour second letter, begun the day the other was dispatched, reached me a\r\nfew days ago, while dear Torrey was here on a visit. He has just\r\nreturned to New York. We called to see Greene, but he was not in....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nNovember 16, 1857.\r\n\r\nI have noted with interest Naudin’s doings in Cucurbitacæ. It has\r\ninduced me to look a little into the geographical question, and I begin\r\nreally to think C. Pepo, and perhaps others, are American. Mr.\r\nSophocles, our Greek tutor, who knows cultivated plants well, and\r\neverything about mediæval and ancient Greek, is quite clear that the\r\nancients knew nothing of pumpkins and winter squashes, and is able to\r\ncorrect De Candolle’s lucubrations in one or two points. Our New England\r\nand Canadian aborigines had beans, too. Those and Cucurbita came north\r\nfrom a warmer climate with maize, I presume....\r\n\r\nWhen I got your proof-sheet of the “British Flora” and your long letter\r\nof 28th May, there was something I wanted to talk about, I dare say, but\r\nthere was no writing then, as you had gone abroad, and now the subject\r\nis all out of my head. But I have occasion to take up the subject of\r\npopular names of plants quite seriously in a week or two, and I may have\r\nsomething to remark.\r\n\r\nI wish to follow your lead, but should be disposed to go rather farther\r\nthan you do in adopting English names. For instance, I would certainly\r\nadopt Mousetail instead of Myosure. Myosure is hardly more English than\r\nbefore clipping its tail a little, and Mousetail is the exact\r\nequivalent. Corydal and Astragal I quite like, as they have really no\r\nEnglish names. I incline to Crowfoot as a generic appellation. To extend\r\nit over the whole genus is only doing what is so often done with\r\nscientific generic names. In the case of genera having very strongly\r\nmarked subgenera, would it not be possible to let the subgeneric name\r\ngovern the popular nomenclature? as say--\r\n\r\nPear; genus=Pyrus, under it\r\n      Pear, with its species;\r\n      Apple, 1. Common Apple,\r\n             2. Crab-Apple, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are formidable difficulties about this popular nomenclature, yet\r\nthey must be surmounted in some way or other.\r\n\r\nAs we are making much of English, why not say “rootstock” instead of\r\n“rhizome.” I do not like French forms. I would even say “pod” instead of\r\n“capsule,” in popular parlance.\r\n\r\nKindly send me proofs as you go on. I want much to see them.\r\n\r\nWright’s collections in North Pacific Expedition are here, and he is\r\nturning over his Behring Straits collection and trying to work it out,\r\nwith some help from me. There is a Hongkong collection; there may be\r\nsome of these he would like to ask you to name, so far as you may off\r\nhand. The Japan collection I will elaborate myself. There is not so much\r\nfrom the north as I expected. They had no chance to explore the small\r\nislands connecting with the Kurile Islands. I have only peeped into one\r\nor two parcels; but in one I saw two things which will interest you as\r\nmuch as they did me. Imagine the two most characteristic possible\r\neastern United States plants, Caulophyllum and Diphylleia, both, I\r\nbelieve, our very species. Tell this to Dr. Hooker!\r\n\r\nThe only domestic news I have to tell you is, that on a hot August day\r\nour beloved Newfoundland dog was found dead,--really a sad loss. To\r\nconsole us my brother-in-law, a fortnight after, sent me a puppy of the\r\nsame breed, an uneasy, frolicsome, awkward fellow yet, but promising to\r\nbe intelligent and very handsome. We could not bear to give him the\r\nname of his lamented predecessor; so Mrs. Gray named him Hans,--a\r\nsouvenir of Pontrilas....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray’s dogs and cats were always well-recognized members of the\r\nfamily. He had a great love of animals, which was warmly returned by his\r\ndifferent pets. In his early married life the kittens he helped raise by\r\nfeeding them with a dropping-tube from his microscope rather preferred\r\nhim to their young and careless mother, and, confounding all other men\r\nwith him, were perpetually scrambling into laps, to the surprise of\r\ncallers. Two grew into fine cats, who demanded a regular attention and\r\nconsideration from him, reminding him by gentle taps, one on each side,\r\nwhen bedtime came.\r\n\r\nOf his first dog, he always said that they stood more in the relation of\r\nbrothers than master and dog; and the dog felt a guardian care of him.\r\nThe different characters of his two Newfoundland dogs, and of the\r\nsmaller ones he had later, interested him, for they were singularly\r\ndifferent, though both the Newfoundlands shared his affection for a\r\npretty Maltese cat who had succeeded the other cats; they were\r\nespecially fond of her kittens and attentive to them, allowing them all\r\nsorts of liberties. The cats and dogs always lived affectionately\r\ntogether. Dr. Gray always recognized their good consciences, which\r\nvaried somewhat with the different type of animal, and considered that\r\nthe size of different breeds had much to do with their characteristics.\r\nThey always learned to eat what their master did; not so much, he would\r\nsay, from any preference for oysters and dry toast, as that they were\r\nambitious to do as far as possible what he did.\r\n\r\nHe was very skillful in the handling of animals, and they recognized it\r\nin allowing him to perform small surgical operations, to dress wounds,\r\netc., with a touching trust and submission.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nMarch 9, 1858.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BENTHAM,--Many thanks for yours of February 14. Although much\r\npleased to hear from you, I cannot expect to hear often, unless you have\r\nsomething special to say. No one but Hooker can write long and frequent\r\nletters while he is doing such a vast amount of work, and keeping up\r\nsuch a fresh, and keen, and scrutinizing interest in such a great\r\nvariety of subjects. I wonder how he does it. How well oiled the\r\nmachinery of his brain must be to do it all without great wear and tear!\r\nIf you or I had half these matters to think of at once, we should go\r\ndistracted. Warn Hooker to take good care of himself and not break down\r\nin health. It is a facility which he inherits, that of turning from one\r\nthing to another without loss of time or of working power.\r\n\r\nI shall be pleased to see the “Handbook” when it is out. Never mind what\r\npeople say. I dare say the little book will do a great deal of good....\r\n\r\nI am glad you will distribute more of Spruce’s plants. I want especially\r\nany of his Andes collections, for Baños was one of our Exploring\r\nExpedition stations. I am going to finish up our Exploring Expedition\r\nthis year (D. V.), and have done with it. That and some other things\r\ndone, and I dream of coming over to England, and working at nothing but\r\n“North American Flora,” de novo. I hope I may, and that I shall find you\r\nand Mrs. B. as fresh as ever, and enjoying yourselves to the full....\r\n\r\nApril 26.\r\n\r\nMy last book[37] in elementary botany is now just off my hands, and will\r\nbe out in a fortnight. I hope it will be of use. Forgive me for writing\r\nhorn-books, and I am now done with that sort of work. There were several\r\nconvincing reasons for doing it.\r\n\r\nTO DANIEL CADY EATON.[38]\r\n\r\nFebruary 23, 1858.\r\n\r\nI dare say you may learn something here as to teaching, etc., if you can\r\npick it up yourself, which, after all, is the only way anything worth\r\nknowing is obtained. But from now to the end of April I am just\r\noverwhelmed with work, and shall have no time to give any special\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the term I begin my drilling of Sophomores in the\r\n“Botanical Text-Book.” My lectures to a selection of Juniors, on\r\nSystematic Botany, I do not ordinarily commence till April 1, but this\r\nyear I am able to begin early in March, though not much work is done\r\ntill May. You might attend Agassiz’s lectures, but he will not be back\r\nfrom Florida as soon as the opening of the term.\r\n\r\nLet me know how much instruction you have to give this year, and of what\r\nsort, and I can see whether I can help you much. I dare say you will\r\nteach very well.\r\n\r\nThere are certain little matters you might pick up about class\r\nillustration and manipulation without it costing you much time. We were\r\njust thinking of sending you Wright’s Hongkong ferns.\r\n\r\nSuppose you come on, count as a pupil, or as a visitor, as you like,\r\nwork away as you think best, making preparations for your course, in\r\nwhich I will help you all I can. And at the same time work up Wright’s\r\nHongkong and Bonin and Japan ferns (bring any books you want which I\r\nhave not). I want to drill you a little at systematic work, and think\r\nyou will learn something that way. Come straight here. We shall want you\r\nto stay with us, if the house is empty. And if not we shall make no\r\ndifficulty of sending you down to the Brattle House. But it would be so\r\nmuch more convenient here.\r\n\r\nI am very desirous that you should be duly established at Yale, and have\r\nno doubt you will satisfy the college and fill the place with comfort\r\nand credit.\r\n\r\nWe will talk over matters at odd moments when you come.\r\n\r\nI shall be most glad to help you as a friend and fellow-worker; but I\r\ncannot promise any special instruction, and shall take no fee. “Dog does\r\nnot eat dog,” is the saying, you know.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJudge Lowell writes, in 1888, “I was in college when Dr. Gray was\r\nappointed to his professorship at Harvard, and ours was, I think, the\r\nfirst or one of the first classes to whom he lectured. I remember his\r\nlectures well, they were so full of knowledge and of enthusiasm and so\r\ncalculated to impress the young mind.\r\n\r\n“I suppose he had not lectured much of late years; and in his many other\r\nsuccesses, his powers as a lecturer may have been overlooked by those\r\nwho have written of him.”\r\n\r\nDr. Rothrock, in his address before the memorial meeting of the\r\nbotanical section of the Academy at Philadelphia, speaks of Dr. Gray’s\r\npatient drilling of him in writing his thesis, making him go over and\r\nover it again, until it had been rewritten six times before he allowed\r\nhim to be satisfied with it. His pupils would always remember his\r\ncomment when satisfied,--“That is neatly stated.”\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Farlow shows the picturesque figure “hurrying down Garden Street\r\n(on lecture mornings) so covered by the mass of branches and flowers\r\nwhich were to illustrate the lecture that his head and body were hardly\r\nvisible.”[39]\r\n\r\n“The few who gathered around the little table in Harvard Hall, in\r\npursuit of knowledge which did not count in the college reckoning, will\r\nnever forget the untiring patience with which he explained what then\r\nseemed difficult, the contagious enthusiasm with which he led them on\r\nfrom simple facts toward the higher fields of science, or the tender\r\npersonal interest which he showed in their hopes and half-formed plans\r\nfor the future; an interest which, on his part, only strengthened as\r\nyears passed on, and makes them now mourn, not so much the death of a\r\ngreat botanist as the loss of a sympathizing friend.”[40]\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nApril 30, 1858.\r\n\r\nI must tell you that in humble imitation of Kew, I am going to establish\r\na museum of vegetable products, etc., in our university.\r\n\r\nThe erection of a new building for the Museum of Comparative Anatomy and\r\nfor the Mineralogical Cabinet liberates the very fine hall used for the\r\nMineralogical Cabinet formerly. This I have applied for, and obtained\r\nfor my purposes, and am taking into it the various things I have picked\r\nup from time to time. It is a room about forty-five feet long, with deep\r\nalcoves the whole length of each side, already shelved, and with glass\r\ndoors to the cases, a window in each of the ten alcoves; the centre, or\r\nnave, serves for my lecture-room. So now I shall beg all my students and\r\ncorrespondents to send me every sort of vegetable thing; so if there is\r\nanything you need still from this country you should let me know; and\r\nwhenever you are overrun with duplicate woods, etc., just think how\r\nwelcome such things would be here, and how they may stimulate our\r\ncollectors and travelers, who perchance may occasionally send me\r\nsomething that would fill some gap in the Kew museum.\r\n\r\nMr. Wright is having a good training here, and when he goes again to\r\nCuba, or elsewhere, will do much better, both as to common botanical\r\nspecimens and for collecting vegetable products and curiosities.\r\n\r\nDr. A. A. Gould, who will bring a line to you, is a physician in Boston,\r\nand one of our best zoölogists, especially in conchology, etc.; a most\r\nexcellent man. He takes a well-deserved holiday for three months or so,\r\nmostly in a run over the Continent. He has London friends in plenty. He\r\nmay like to see Kew Gardens before one o’clock, and would be pleased to\r\npay his respects to you in person, if his time allows a flying visit to\r\nKew before he proceeds to the Continent.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, and since my parcel of books for you left the\r\nhouse, the May number of “Silliman’s Journal” has come in. I will ask\r\nDr. Gould to take it to you....\r\n\r\nJune 21.\r\n\r\nAbout the museum. Ours is to be not economical (except in the sense that\r\nit must not cost anything to speak of) but for class illustration and\r\nbotanical research. So I want woods, fruits, seeds, etc., and must keep\r\nall within narrow limits. All I could venture to ask from you is that\r\nwhenever your keeper or Dr. Hooker should be throwing out duplicates to\r\nsave room, you would have some such things boxed up for me. I should\r\nindeed like to go over to you, and select for myself, as you and Dr.\r\nHooker suggest. Joseph suggests that I should be sent over by the\r\nuniversity for the purpose! His whole idea is as magnificent as my plan\r\nis humble. I fear I must always travel and cross the ocean at my own\r\ncharges. But the proposition suggests to me that, when I am ready to\r\nrevisit England, this will be a good ground for asking leave of absence\r\nwithout cutting off my pay. But there is much to be done before I can\r\nleave home again, and when I shall be ready and able to do so, if it\r\nplease Providence that I may be, I want two full years and most of it at\r\nKew. How I hope it may be done in your day, and that I may receive your\r\ncordial greeting, and find you as hale and as actively useful as ever.\r\nBut “l’homme propose,” etc. We are delighted to hear from Mrs. E. that\r\nyou are well and strong again.\r\n\r\nBoott kindly writes me of Brown by every mail; by the next arrival we\r\nmust expect to hear that he is no more....\r\n\r\nWherever Wright goes, you may rely upon the fullest set of his\r\ngatherings, and we may expect they will be better than formerly. For\r\n(what I never thought he would have patience for) he has really taken\r\nto studying botany, which he never did before, and digs away at his\r\ndried specimens most perseveringly. At first it went against the grain,\r\nand he used to wish himself far off in the woods. But he has kept on for\r\nsix or eight months, and now generally prefers to find out a plant by\r\nhis own skill, rather than have me tell him what it is; so he will be\r\nable to collect more understandingly, and the year passed here will not\r\nbe lost time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Robert Brown died shortly after the date of this letter. In Dr.\r\nGray’s memoir of him, he says:--\r\n\r\n“Upon the death of Robert Brown, it was remarked that, next to Humboldt,\r\nhis name adorned the list of a greater number of scientific societies\r\nthan that of any other naturalist or philosopher. It was Humboldt\r\nhimself who, many years ago, saluted Brown with the appellation,\r\n‘Botanicorum facile princeps,’ and the universal consent of botanists\r\nrecognized and confirmed the title.... Brown delighted to rise from a\r\nspecial case to high and wide generalizations; and was apt to draw most\r\nimportant and always irresistible conclusions from small selected data\r\nor particular points of structure. He had unequaled skill in finding\r\ndecisive instances.... So all his discoveries and all his notes and\r\nobservations are fertile far beyond the reader’s expectation. Perhaps no\r\nnaturalist ever taught so much in writing so little.... Those who knew\r\nhim as a man will bear unanimous testimony to the unvarying simplicity,\r\ntruthfulness, and benevolence of his character, as well as to the\r\nsingular uprightness of his judgment.”[41]\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nJune 1, 1858.\r\n\r\nYour gift of the “Oxford Essays” came to me, and was partly read with\r\nmuch interest before the arrival of your kind letter of the 31st March.\r\nMany thanks for both.\r\n\r\nI know too little of French literature, early or late, but I admire your\r\narticle for its neat and delicate delineation and discrimination of\r\ncharacter. I read with interest, not unmingled with concern, Baden\r\nPowell’s and Wilson’s articles. The latter person I heard preach one of\r\nthe Bampton lectures at Oxford, 1851. Into what will the latitudinarian\r\nschool, if I may so call it, develop at Oxford?\r\n\r\nGladstone’s article I have not had time to read yet, nor his large work,\r\nwhich probably will reach us presently, through our book club,--I hope\r\nat a time when I have more leisure than now.\r\n\r\nLast week the publishers, at my request, sent to Trübner & Company,\r\nAmerican booksellers (12 or 20) Paternoster Row, a copy of a new and\r\nmore elementary book[42] of mine than the one you are pleased to\r\ncompliment. I intended that as a kind of horn-book, which Dr. Hooker\r\ninsists it is not; and as something more simple was wanted here, to lead\r\nthe way both to the “Lessons” and especially to the “Manual,” which is\r\nrather strong for beginners, I have tried again, and you will see the\r\nresult. I should have made the little “Popular Flora” fuller if the\r\npublishers had allowed more room.\r\n\r\nHaving last year reëdited my “Botanical Textbook” (of which, to complete\r\nyour set, a copy is also sent to you, through Trübner), I have now done\r\nmy part in elementary botanical writing, and I return with zest to my\r\ndrier investigations, in which I have much to do.\r\n\r\nIf I ever find time I am greatly disposed to write some day upon the\r\nprinciples of classification,--the ground in nature for classification,\r\nthe nature and distribution and probable origin of species,--knotty\r\npoints, upon which I incline to differ decidedly from Agassiz, and\r\nconsiderably from the common notions.\r\n\r\nSome of the more immediate and best-established deductions I hope to\r\nbring out in a paper I shall soon be occupied with, containing the\r\nresults of a comparison of the flora of Japan (in which I have new\r\nmaterials) with our own of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nMy college work keeps me very busy at this season.\r\n\r\n... I see no near prospect of revisiting the Old World. The commercial\r\ntroubles last autumn have reduced our moderate means and prospects a\r\nlittle. But if I live I must yet have two years’ work in England and on\r\nthe Continent. With great regard, I remain,\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nJuly 27, 1858.\r\n\r\nI have to-day received a nice present from Vilmorin of Paris, i. e., the\r\ncopy of Robert Brown’s “Prodromus,” presented by him to A. L. de\r\nJussieu.\r\n\r\n... I am kept here, too, by the attending suddenly to building a new\r\nconservatory, for which a donation of $2,000 has been received. I cannot\r\nleave till it is well under way.\r\n\r\nI am deep in Japan botany; interesting results.\r\n\r\nSeptember 24.\r\n\r\nAt length we are home again, arriving night before last, very direct\r\nfrom Quebec, where we had (as everywhere else upon our whole\r\nroute--Litchfield, New York, Palisades, Fairfield, Sauquoit, Montreal,\r\netc.) a delightful time. J. much stronger, except for a cold caught in\r\nQuebec, which still lingers.\r\n\r\nColonel Munro[43] was very kind; is a jolly good fellow, as the English\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nOctober 14, 1858.\r\n\r\nBy this time you are in your house, I hope, and all comfortable, and\r\nready soon to set to work.\r\n\r\nI rejoice to hear that Mr. Shaw keeps up his zeal, and will make a\r\ncreditable establishment. I wish him all prosperity. If he will make and\r\nkeep up a general herbarium it will save you much time and money....\r\n\r\nOctober 30.\r\n\r\nI have yours of the 24th. Tatnall[44] is an old friend of Dr.\r\nDarlington, new to me, but writing to me of late. I know not his age,\r\nprofession, character, etc., etc. But he appears to know the plants\r\naround him very well....\r\n\r\nHope you are getting settled down and comfortable.\r\n\r\nI met Agassiz at the Club. He is cordial and pleasant. He had not heard\r\nof your return, which I wondered at....\r\n\r\nFendler is with you, at least in St. Louis. Short is ready to advance\r\nsomething if he will fall to collecting again wherever you say. Get him\r\nsome appointment with the army at Utah. That is the place. What is the\r\ngood of your both being Democrats if you cannot get something for it!!\r\n\r\nDecember 3.\r\n\r\nDarwin asks me to find out if you medical men have ascertained or\r\nnoticed any difference in liability to take fevers of warm climates, say\r\nyellow fever, between light-complexioned and dark-complexioned people of\r\nthe Caucasian race. If you know personally anything about it, or where\r\nanything is published bearing on the point, kindly let me know, and\r\noblige\r\n\r\nYour old friend,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nDecember 13, 1858.\r\n\r\nBoott writes in glowing terms of your paper on British flora and\r\ndistribution lately read; and I hope soon to read it in the “Linnæan\r\nJournal.”\r\n\r\nThat the interchange of temperate species between North America and\r\nEurope has taken place via Asia is now a patent fact; and now the whole\r\nsubject, and the probable explanation, begins to be clear to see.\r\n\r\nDecember 31.\r\n\r\nA happy New Year to you and Mrs. Bentham, and many thanks for your\r\nletter promising me your paper on Hongkong plants to print here. Pray\r\ngive me passim any notes that occur to you upon Loo Choo plants, etc. I\r\nshall now soon be done with my Japan studies, and shall print a paper\r\nbringing to view curious facts of distribution, etc., and lay out a set\r\nfor the Kew herbarium. How true it is, as you intimated, that the\r\ninterchange in northern hemisphere has mainly been via Asia.\r\n\r\nI heartily admire your “Handbook,” and await with great interest your\r\npaper growing out of it; your experience is so great and your judgment\r\nso sound. As to English nomenclature, we can only approximate to a good\r\nsystem; the practical difficulties are too great, often insurmountable.\r\nIt seems to me you hit the happy medium, if we must needs have popular\r\nname of the genus coëxtensive with the Latin one; but I rather doubt the\r\nadvisability of that, and would use sub-generic popular names for\r\ngeneric, I think. Though “I do not much like” the whole thing, yet\r\nsomebody must attend to English nomenclature, for better or worse; so I\r\nam glad you took it up.\r\n\r\nI hope you will study perigynous and epigynous. As to ovary, which,\r\nputting the important part for the whole, we have learned to use in\r\nplace of pistil, it certainly is perfectly novel to me to hear the name\r\napplied to the gynæcium of Ranunculus. I am confident the word is never\r\nso used in De Candolle or Endlicher. I do not recall any instance of\r\nyour using the word in any such sense; I am sure I never did. Where the\r\nfact of the combination is doubtful or ambiguous, if I said ovary, that\r\nwould infer the combination; if ovaries, the distinctness. In Apocynaceæ\r\nA. De Candolle steadily writes ovarium or ovaria, according to the\r\nnature of the case. Per contra, you might as well call the column of\r\nMalva a stamen! For the collective term, I wish, in your paper, you\r\nwould go for restoring to use the Linnæan term pistillum, and against\r\nthe habit of using ovarium in a double sense, that is, sometimes for\r\nwhole female organ, sometimes for its ovule-bearing portion. Pray do not\r\nadd a third; and so when you speak of ovary in Clematis leave us to\r\ngather, from the context, whether you mean, (1) the whole gynæcium; (2)\r\na separate pistil; or, (3) the ovuliferous portion of a pistil.\r\n\r\nHooker calls my judgment about root and radicle “a flippant snub”! I beg\r\na thousand pardons, and had no intention to be flippant or dogmatical,\r\nbut simply to record a fact. For _mistake_, pray read _take_. My thanks\r\nfor his letter of December 8th; will write him soon.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2, 1859.\r\n\r\nI wish I had now your paper on geographical distribution, while I am\r\nworking up the relations of the Japan flora in this respect. Where is\r\nAgardh’s paper published, and what does it amount to?...\r\n\r\nI cannot answer Dr. Hooker’s exceedingly interesting letter about\r\ntheoretical ancient distribution of plants this week. Tell him I shall\r\nhave some evidence which will come well into his views as to north\r\ntemperate zone.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nJanuary 24, 1859.\r\n\r\nI hope soon to hear that Government will acquire your herbarium, and\r\nmake bountiful provision for its increase and maintenance. After all\r\nBrown’s genius, you have done more for botany than a dozen Browns, and\r\nmade a hundredfold more sacrifices and efforts. To you, and to your son,\r\nEngland and the botanical world owe the greatest debt of gratitude,--a\r\ndebt which I hope will continue to accumulate a long time yet....\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7, 1859.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I will send your bundles presently, after Tuesday next,\r\ntill when I must work like a dog, to get through the Japan collection,\r\nand read a paper on Tuesday at a social meeting of the Academy at Mr.\r\nLoring’s house that evening (January 11th). Now come on (if by day\r\ntrain), stop there, 8 Ashburton Place, where I will be.\r\n\r\nI am going to hold forth for nearly an hour, upon Japan botany in its\r\nrelation to ours and the rest of the northern temperate zone, and knock\r\nout the underpinning of Agassiz’s theories about species and their\r\norigin; show, from the very facts that stumbled De Candolle, the high\r\nprobability of single and local creation of species, turning some of\r\nAgassiz’s own guns against him.\r\n\r\nI introduced it here at Club, last month, and Agassiz took it very well,\r\nindeed....\r\n\r\nI asked Thurber the name of a couple of Grasses. Let the Grass-man\r\nspeak; now that he is turned out to grass, let him attend to his\r\ngrazing.\r\n\r\nFebruary 19.\r\n\r\nAndersson writes me that I am chosen one of the six botanists on the\r\nforeign list of Stockholm Academy, to fill the vacancy caused by Robert\r\nBrown’s death.\r\n\r\nFriday evening, [April].\r\n\r\nI have your two favors of 12th and 15th. I am very grateful for the nice\r\ncare you take of my wife. You seem to have her under very thorough\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nCure her up fast as you can, and please return her per railway on the 3d\r\nof May; for the 4th being the eleventh anniversary of our union, we\r\nmust not be separated then--“The Union, it must be preserved.” ...\r\n\r\nI send back your Cavendish with many thanks.\r\n\r\nThe old cock was much like Robert Brown in many respects. Though there\r\nis nothing in him to love, he calls out a sort of admiration, partly in\r\nthe literal sense, that is, wonder, mixed with pity, that he had no\r\nfeelings. Brown had, and besides he was social and not so very queer,\r\nbut he lived very much in the same way, and I suppose had as little\r\nsense of religion.\r\n\r\nSchreber spells Anthephora, but gives no derivation. P. de B., you see,\r\ndoes, so Anthephora is doubtless right.\r\n\r\nCan that and Buffalo-grass be the same? I doubt. Has the Anthephora-like\r\nplant no stamens of its own?\r\n\r\nThe mode of growth does not so much distinguish your plant from\r\nNewberry’s Hemitones, and verily I suspect they are the same species.\r\nPity you come in and spoil a good name!...\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nApril 27, 1859.\r\n\r\nI am charmed at the intelligence you give of your son, and that he takes\r\nto botany with spirit, so that he may continue the celebrity of the\r\nhonored name of De Candolle in the third generation.\r\n\r\nWe shall welcome him when he comes to America and will do all we can to\r\nadvance his objects. Oregon and the country to the north of it (British\r\nColumbia) will be in good and safe condition to explore, and I am\r\nconvinced that there is still much to find in the Sandwich Islands,\r\nespecially in the interior of Hawaii, where there is said to be a\r\nbroad, almost untrodden, wooded region, between the principal\r\nmountain-masses, and occupying a good part of the interior of the\r\nisland. But it will take time, patience, and considerable means to\r\nexplore this region; provisions must be carried in for a long way, and\r\nmany natives employed in feeding the exploring party. Next, the Kurile\r\nIslands, and all the northern part of Japan, Yesso, and the islands\r\nnortheast of it offer the greatest interest; Manchuria also, but the\r\nRussians will look after that; Korea could perhaps be explored, so that\r\nthe expedition you have suggested strikes my fancy as the best that\r\ncould be, and would take your son through regions full of interest, safe\r\nto explore, and healthy. Certainly I can suggest nothing better.\r\n\r\nPray give my best regards to M. Boissier and to other friends in Geneva.\r\nI trust you will have safety and tranquillity in Switzerland. But it\r\nappears as if you would have war all around you,--a very sad state of\r\nthings. Our latest intelligence looks very warlike, I am sorry to see.\r\nWith all my heart I join in the supplication, “Give peace in our time, O\r\nLord.” From such a war as is threatened no good can spring, in any\r\nresult....\r\n\r\nEver and very cordially yours,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nMay 18, 1859.\r\n\r\nWell, even $10,000 a year is much better than nothing for the botanical\r\nestablishment. I wish we had half of that....\r\n\r\nIf Shaw will be liberal in his establishment, why not turn over to him\r\nyour general herbarium? If I had one I could have free access to always,\r\nI would not take the expense and trouble of keeping up and increasing\r\none myself....\r\n\r\nSo, you have made the capital discovery, and proved the so-called\r\nAnthephora to be the female of Buffalo-grass. I would not have believed\r\nit without direct evidence.\r\n\r\nI cannot study it; it would take me a long while to get the case so\r\nbefore me that my opinion about the affinities of the grass would be of\r\nany use; but it is most interesting, and I beg you to work it out in\r\ndetail and thoroughly....\r\n\r\nJune 6.\r\n\r\nAs to your own herbarium, I think you are right for the present. Keep\r\nyou own; arrange it on paper of the size of Shaw’s. But look to an\r\neventual combination, either in Shaw’s lifetime or soon after, and be\r\nopen to propositions from Shaw; as, for example, to take your whole\r\nherbarium, provide for maintenance and increase, and when ready, to make\r\nyou director of the whole concern. This duty must devolve upon you, and\r\nwhen it does, with a decent salary, you could reside up there, throw\r\nphysic to the dogs, or only take a share in consultations, and have time\r\nto do yourself justice in botany.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, if Shaw would take your herbarium upon proper terms, you\r\nmight at any time have any particular families of plants with you, in\r\nyour house, to work at....\r\n\r\nMr. Shaw has lately written. I inclose his letter to you. I have just\r\nreplied to it, expressing a lively interest in his projected\r\nestablishment, and offering my best services if he requires them in the\r\nway of advice or suggestion. I hope it will be all right in the end....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nLETTERS TO DARWIN AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n1860-1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs before stated, Dr. Gray’s letters to Dr. Darwin previous to 1862 have\r\nbeen destroyed, save the one dated January 23, 1860, which was published\r\nin Darwin’s “Life and Letters,” and is here reproduced for the\r\nconvenience of the reader, as well as Dr. Gray’s letter of January 5,\r\n1860, to Dr. Joseph D. Hooker, also published in Darwin’s “Life and\r\nLetters.” The original letters to Darwin later than 1862 have been more\r\nor less injured, apparently by the ravages of mice, so that in copying\r\nthem it has sometimes been necessary to supply missing words. Where\r\nthese are not obvious, the supposed words are enclosed in brackets.\r\n\r\nThe letters in this chapter also include the period of the civil war;\r\ninto which, as they show, Dr. Gray threw himself with all his\r\nearnestness. He helped as far as he was able in every way. A company of\r\nthe men who were too old or otherwise incapacitated from going to the\r\nfront was enlisted in Cambridge to guard the State Arsenal there, and\r\nalso to be ready to be summoned in any emergency; and he joined the\r\nranks and was faithful in the drilling and every duty to which they were\r\ncalled. It is hard to realize, in these days, how all the community\r\nworked together in all possible ways; it was the business of life.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 5, 1860.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--Your last letter, which reached me just before\r\nChristmas, has got mislaid during the upturnings in my study which take\r\nplace at that season, and has not yet been discovered. I should be very\r\nsorry to lose it, for there were in it some botanical mems. which I had\r\nnot secured....\r\n\r\nThe principal part of your letter was high laudation of Darwin’s book.\r\n\r\nWell, the book has reached me, and I finished its careful perusal four\r\ndays ago; and I freely say that your laudation is not out of place.\r\n\r\nIt is done in a masterly manner. It might well have taken twenty years\r\nto produce it. It is crammed full of most interesting matter, thoroughly\r\ndigested, well expressed, close, cogent; and taken as a system it makes\r\nout a better case than I had supposed possible....\r\n\r\nI will write to Darwin when I get a chance. As I have promised, he and\r\nyou shall have fair play here.... I must myself write a review of\r\nDarwin’s book for “Silliman’s Journal” (the more so that I suspect\r\nAgassiz means to come out upon it) for the next (March) number, and I am\r\nnow setting about it when I ought to be every moment working the\r\nExploring Expedition Compositæ, which I know far more about. And really\r\nit is no easy job, as you may well imagine.\r\n\r\nI doubt if I shall please you altogether. I know I shall not please\r\nAgassiz at all. I hear another reprint is in the press, and the book\r\nwill excite much attention here, and some controversy....\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 23, 1860.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--You have my hurried letter telling you of the arrival\r\nof the remainder of the sheets of the reprint, and of the stir I had\r\nmade for a reprint in Boston. Well, all looked pretty well, when lo, we\r\nfound that a second New York publishing house had announced a reprint\r\nalso! I wrote then to both New York publishers, asking them to give way\r\nto the author and his reprint of a revised edition. I got an answer from\r\nHarpers that they withdraw; from the Appletons, that they had got the\r\nbook out (and the next day I saw a copy); but that, “if the work should\r\nhave any considerable sale, we certainly shall be disposed to pay the\r\nauthor reasonably and liberally.”\r\n\r\nThe Appletons being thus out with their reprint, the Boston house\r\ndeclined to go on. So I wrote to the Appletons, taking them at their\r\nword, offering to aid their reprint, to give them the use of the\r\nalterations in the London reprint, as soon as I find out what they are,\r\netc., etc. And I sent them the first leaf, and asked them to insert in\r\ntheir future issue the additional matter from Butler,[45] which tells\r\njust right. So there the matter stands. If you furnish any matter in\r\nadvance of the London third edition, I will make them pay for it.\r\n\r\nI may get something for you. All got is clear gain; but it will not be\r\nvery much, I suppose.\r\n\r\nSuch little notices in the papers as have yet appeared are quite\r\nhandsome and considerable.\r\n\r\nI hope next week to get printed sheets of my review from New Haven, and\r\nsend them to you, and will ask you to pass them on to Dr. Hooker.\r\n\r\nTo fulfill your request, I ought to tell you what I think the weakest,\r\nand what the best, part of your book. But this is not easy, nor to be\r\ndone in a word or two. The best part, I think, is _the whole_, that is,\r\nits plan and treatment, the vast amount of facts and acute inferences\r\nhandled as if you had a perfect mastery of them. I do not think twenty\r\nyears too much time to produce such a book in.\r\n\r\nStyle clear and good, but now and then wants revision for little matters\r\n(p. 97, self-fertilizes itself, etc.).\r\n\r\nThen your candor is worth everything to your cause. It is refreshing to\r\nfind a person with a new theory who frankly confesses that he finds\r\ndifficulties, insurmountable at least for the present. I know some\r\npeople who never have any difficulties to speak of.\r\n\r\nThe moment I understood your premises, I felt sure you had a real\r\nfoundation to hold on. Well, if one admits your premises, I do not see\r\nhow he is to stop short of your conclusions, as a probable hypothesis at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nIt naturally happens that my review of your book does not exhibit\r\nanything like the full force of the impression the book has made upon\r\nme. Under the circumstances I suppose I do your theory more good here,\r\nby bespeaking for it a fair and favorable consideration, and by standing\r\nnoncommitted as to its full conclusion, than I should if I announced\r\nmyself a convert; nor could I say the latter, with truth.\r\n\r\nWell, what seems to me the weakest point in the book is the attempt to\r\naccount for the formation of organs, the making of eyes, etc., by\r\nnatural selection. Some of this reads quite Lamarckian.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on Hybridism is not a _weak_, but a _strong_ chapter. You\r\nhave done wonders there. But still you have not accounted, as you may be\r\nheld to account, for divergence up to a certain extent producing\r\nincreased fertility of the crosses, but carried one short, almost\r\nimperceptible, step more, giving rise to sterility, or reversing the\r\ntendency. Very likely you are on the right track; but you have something\r\nto do yet in that department.\r\n\r\nEnough for the present.\r\n\r\nI am not insensible to your compliments, the very high compliment which\r\nyou pay me in valuing my opinion. You evidently think more of it than I\r\ndo, though from the way I write to you, and especially to Hooker, this\r\nmight not be inferred from the reading of my letters.\r\n\r\nI am free to say that I never learnt so much from one book as I have\r\nfrom yours. There remain a thousand things I long to say about it.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES L. BRACE.\r\n\r\n1861 (?)\r\n\r\nDEAR BRACE,--I should criticise various things in your last “Times”\r\narticle, if you were here to talk it over with me.\r\n\r\nIf you expected Huxley to do what you criticise him for not doing, you\r\nwould naturally be disappointed. His merit, and his way as a lecturer,\r\nis to select some good topic or point of view and make a clear\r\nexposition of it, the clearness of which very much depends upon his not\r\nscattering himself over too much ground. He naturally kept himself to\r\nmatters he could handle well, and let alone those upon which, as we very\r\nwell know, he had nothing in particular to say.\r\n\r\n1. “Merest fancies,” “baseless fabric of a dream,” etc.\r\n\r\nWhy, what made Owen an evolutionist as early as Darwin? And what has\r\nmade so many naturalists, Mivart, and lately Dana, for instance,\r\nevolutionists, who yet think nothing of Natural Selection?\r\n\r\nBut to illustrate. You allow that the evolutionary pedigree of the horse\r\nis made out. But what had “Natural Selection” to do with the making this\r\nout?\r\n\r\nIt would have been all the very same, both the evidence and the ground\r\nof the inference, if Natural Selection had never been propounded. There\r\nis no evidence how the forms were selected, there is simply the _fact_\r\nof the series of forms, which, with other like evidence, brings\r\nconviction to most naturalists that one has somehow come from the other.\r\nAnd this conviction is about as strong to those who do not believe\r\n“Natural Selection” will explain it, as those who do.\r\n\r\n2. Professor Guyot, you mean. Dana avowedly adopts from Guyot.\r\n\r\n3. To those who talk or think of necessary evolution, or, like Spencer,\r\ndeduce it ex necessitate rei, this matter of immense time is very\r\npertinent. I don’t think Darwin is bothered by it much. On my way of\r\nthinking, it is no bother at all, considering what a deal of time there\r\nhas been anyway.\r\n\r\n4. Do you mean “hybrid forms”? I fail to see what hybrids, that is,\r\nmules from the crossing of related species, has to do with it, one way\r\nor the other. Nobody (of clear conceptions) supposes new species come\r\nfrom the mixture of other species. That is a way to confuse or blend\r\nspecies, not to originate them. But there is no “want of hybrids;”\r\nthere are plenty of them, and they have mixed some few species (dogs,\r\nfor instance); but they play no important part in the matters you are\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\n“Want of connecting forms in living species,” that is to the purpose.\r\nWell, as a systematic botanist, I wish there was a _want_. The\r\nconnecting forms are my _great trouble_ every day. You would save me an\r\nawful deal of trouble, time, and constant uncertainty, if you would\r\ncause them to be wanting!\r\n\r\n5. So you will not accept the motto “ex uno disce omnes.”\r\n\r\nIf you admit the horse’s evolution as proved, does not that carry an\r\nimplication of evolution in other lines, of which similar, but fewer\r\nsteps are known? Or are all evolutions those of cavalry?\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 17, 1862.\r\n\r\nDEAR BRACE,--Thanks for the “World.” Who wield its destinies?\r\n\r\nIt is, I suppose, your article on Darwin, a very good one, for its\r\npurpose and space.\r\n\r\nBefore you too confidently reject the evidence for the existence of man\r\nin the diluvial period, just turn over a very impartial and good article\r\nby Pictet,--a good judge of such matters,--in the March number of the\r\n“Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève,” “De la Question sur l’Homme\r\nFossile.”\r\n\r\nI presume it is in the Astor Library. If it is not, you may tell Mr.\r\nCogswell there might as well not be any Astor Library.\r\n\r\nEver thine,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 22, 1862 (?)\r\n\r\nDEAR BRACE,--You are very welcome to such casual criticism as I can\r\noffer on your two pages of manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe general fact of a segregated people (or individuals of an animal\r\nspecies) becoming best adapted to the particular climate, etc., through\r\nNatural Selection is clear enough, the best adapted alone surviving in\r\nthe long run, and the peculiarities transmitted by the close breeding.\r\n\r\nBut what your statements tend to make out is, not the tendency of a\r\nhuman race to return to its original type, but only the tendency of the\r\ncauses which produced a certain effect once, to produce it again, the\r\ncircumstances continuing,--to produce it in the Fellahs as it produced\r\nit in the remote ancestors of the Pharaohs.\r\n\r\nThat is all safe enough. But your case does not prove that unless you\r\nmake out that the Egyptian race was nearly destroyed by crossings.\r\n\r\nI do not know, but I doubt if you can show that the crossings were ever\r\nenough to modify the Egyptian people, at least the common people, who\r\nmake up the bulk. Slight infusions, you see, would be worked out. The\r\nforeign though conquering race would be less prolific and less enduring\r\nthan the native, etc., etc. So is it not likely that in the Fellahs you\r\nhave the representatives of the old Egyptians continued, not reproduced,\r\nas your remarks would partly lead one to suppose your meaning?\r\n\r\nBesides, once having got a race you must not make too much of climate,\r\nto the overlooking of the wonderful persistence of any variety when\r\nclose bred. See the Jews: the nose remains hooked, etc., under all\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\nAgain, in your last sentence. When you _unscientific people_ take up a\r\nscientific principle you are apt to make too much of it, to push it to\r\nconclusions beyond what is warranted by the facts. But, because a\r\nparticular race has persisted in Egypt, how do you know that it is the\r\nonly race capable of perpetuating itself?\r\n\r\nIf there had been a large infusion of different people in Egypt, and if\r\nthey had exterminated the old race, do you not suppose this would have\r\nestablished itself, perpetuated itself, and that its particular\r\nadaptations to the climate would have been different from that of the\r\npresent race?\r\n\r\nIf you cut off all future immigration into North America, would the\r\nIndians resume possession of the country? or else our descendants become\r\na copper-colored race?\r\n\r\nEnough for the present. When you have cracked these nuts, send me, if\r\nyou please, another sheet.\r\n\r\nEver yours cordially,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 6, 1863.\r\n\r\nDEAR BRACE,--Yours of 20th ult. came just as J. was off for New Haven\r\nand I getting ready to go to her aid.\r\n\r\nWe came back only on Thursday, or rather Friday morning. My hands so\r\nfull that I could not write to Darwin, to whom I owe a long letter, till\r\nto-night. I will now inclose your note.\r\n\r\nIt would be very like a chemist to think that external influences will\r\nexplain everything. But I presume he believes that peculiarities are\r\nheritable. If he does, then he thinks he can explain, or will be able to\r\nexplain, the origination of variations. I cannot, that is, to any\r\nextent, and do not expect to. When he will show us how external\r\ninfluences actually worked to change a peach into a nectarine, I will\r\nconsider his proposition.\r\n\r\nIf he means by “external influences” whatever has brought about the\r\nchange, very well. I, of course, allow that every variation has a cause,\r\na physical cause. But it seems to me you may as well say that conception\r\nand the production of a normal offspring is the result of “external\r\ninfluences” as the production of an abnormal (variant) offspring.\r\n\r\nBut there is no use writing at random.\r\n\r\nYou ask me whether I adhere to my notions before expressed, without at\r\nall showing me how they have been impugned.\r\n\r\nI should rather expect Guyot to indorse Beaumont; a theological bias\r\nwould act strongly.\r\n\r\nBut I rely most on Lartet, Coulon, and Pictet, for the age of deposit.\r\nYet it may still be an open question....\r\n\r\nDarwin, on account of his health, has to live away from London, and is a\r\nrecluse. I give no letters to him, least of all to a lively inquisitive\r\nYankee like Beecher, who would give him a fit of dyspepsia at once, from\r\nmere excitement.\r\n\r\nI have the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg honorary\r\nmembership; quite a feather, as they are choice and few. Diploma just\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nMay 7, 1861.\r\n\r\nIt was very good of you to write to me (by your letter of 28th of March)\r\nwhen I believe that a former letter of yours was still unacknowledged by\r\nme. Your letters always give me much pleasure.\r\n\r\nWhat you say of “Essays and Reviews” seems to me most sensible and well\r\nconsidered; the best thing I have read about the book, viz., that, “with\r\nmany good and true things in it, it is a reckless book,” and that some\r\nof the writers had not taken the trouble to clear up their own thoughts\r\nand to form orderly and consistent notions before publishing upon such\r\ndelicate topics.\r\n\r\nI have not yet read the book; have only looked it over, and read some of\r\nthe criticisms. When I have a few days’ leisure in the country, in July,\r\nI mean to read it carefully. After the flurry is over, I hope the book\r\nwill receive the proper kind of handling in England, by the proper men.\r\nI wish you would think it in your way to write an essay upon some of the\r\npoints at issue, upon which inconsiderate views are likely to be taken\r\nupon either side.\r\n\r\nI confess to a strong dislike of Baden Powell’s writings. He seems to\r\nhave had a coarse, materialistic, non-religious mind; at least, he is\r\nnot the sort of man I should select to illustrate the delicate relations\r\nbetween religion and science.\r\n\r\nI am gratified, also, by your apprehending the spirit and object of my\r\nessay[46] on Darwin so much better than many who write to me about it.\r\nAll it pretends to is to warn the reckless and inconsiderate to state\r\nthe case as it is; to protest against the folly of those who would, it\r\nwould seem, go on to fire away the very ramparts of the citadel, in the\r\ndefense of needless outposts; and, as you justly remark, to clear the\r\nway for a fair discussion of the new theory on its merits and evidence.\r\nWe must use the theory a while in botany and in zoölogy, and see how it\r\nwill work; in this way a few years will test it thoroughly. I incline\r\nto think that its principles will be to a certain extent admitted in\r\nscience, but that, as Darwin conceives it, it will prove quite\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\nAs to our country, we have been, as a people, undergoing a steady\r\ndemoralization for the last fifteen or twenty years, the natural end of\r\nwhich lately seemed to be that we should crumble into decay almost\r\nwithout an effort at recovery. If it had been sought under legal forms\r\nand in a less outrageous spirit, I think the North would have consented\r\nto the peaceful separation of the cotton States, and we should have\r\nprospered by the separation. But it has become clear that there would be\r\nno living with such a people as our neighbors would be, so long as they\r\nallow themselves (against the better judgment of the best) to be ruled\r\nby the political demagogues who now hold sway over them. It is clear we\r\nmust fight, and we had better do it now, and fight for the integrity of\r\nthe country and the enforcement of the laws. So we are fairly and justly\r\nin it, and we are going to conquer the South. They have appealed to\r\nforce. They must abide the consequences of the appeal, and, we trust,\r\nGod will help the right. So you may expect to hear of stirring times\r\nhere. Ever, with great regard,\r\n\r\nYours most cordially,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nJanuary 25, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe Union is overthrown by a conspiracy which would have been kept\r\nwithin bounds, and soon shut itself up, if the border slave States cared\r\nenough for the Union to take hold, or even allow it to be arrested or\r\nchecked. But no, they must become insane, like the rest, and help it\r\nalong. Virginia will not take hold and second Kentucky and Tennessee,\r\nfighting nobly by Johnson, Crittenden, etc., declare against treason\r\nfirst, and then arrange terms, which are all ready, all they want, for\r\ncomposing the difficulties.\r\n\r\nBut Cottondom will not have peace and union, and Virginia, etc., are\r\nfoolish enough to help their game. That the border Southern States will\r\nbe the principal sufferers will be only a righteous retribution for\r\ntheir guilt.\r\n\r\nIf, in fact, we only belong to a partnership which any of the partners\r\ncan dissolve at will, then the Union is not worth having. We must do the\r\nbest we can without it, and if Missouri would prosper, she should stay\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nIf peace is wanted, the reasonable proposition, “no more territory to be\r\nacquired without a majority of two thirds of the States,” would give it.\r\nWith that you may do what you like, or rather what you can, in the\r\npresent Territories. No more of the continent is worth having, either\r\nfor North or South.\r\n\r\nPosterity will judge rightly, and Toombs, Cobb, Floyd, etc., will go\r\ndown to their graves as base, dishonored traitors.\r\n\r\nMy fighting days are over, anyway. I have had the misfortune to lose the\r\nend of my left thumb, by an accident, just at the base of the nail.\r\n\r\nMay 25, 1861.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear from you. I believe I have a former letter from\r\nyou unanswered. Lately I mailed to you some botanical pamphlets, one\r\ncontaining the Xantus California plants.[47] But in these times I had\r\nnot the heart to write you. You have seen your dream of peace policy\r\nfall in pieces, and Douglas coming out for the war. You have also seen\r\nenough to perceive that under the let-alone policy Missouri also would\r\nhave seceded, under the same discipline which has been applied\r\nelsewhere. In which event, let alone, St. Louis would dwindle to a\r\ncountry village.\r\n\r\nNo, the first and paramount duty of a country is to protect and preserve\r\nitself against destruction. The Constitution and government must be\r\nmaintained, and treason put down if we are able to do it.\r\n\r\nIf it can’t be done, then, and then only, may we submit to\r\ndisintegration.\r\n\r\nStick firm to the Union, and Missouri will come out well. I am sorry for\r\nthe bloodshed at St. Louis. Your population is hard to manage. But\r\nHarney, as you say, is doing well, and I expect to see your State soon a\r\nloyal one. Even those with secession affinities must soon see their own\r\ninterests. It is impossible there should be peace,--peace is not worth\r\nhaving till the rebellion, based on a plot formed years ago, is put\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIf you think me belligerent, I am nothing to Agassiz. Of course we shall\r\nall suffer severely. But better to suffer in devotion to the Union than\r\nprosper in petty fragments.\r\n\r\nEnough of this. May God preserve and keep you, and let us hear from you\r\nwhen you can; for we take great interest in you, and know your position\r\nis a trying one.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, August 6, 1861.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ENGELMANN,--As soon as I got clear of college work, my wife and\r\nI started off (on the 12th of July) to visit my mother and friends in\r\nOneida County, New York, where we rode and drove about in the fine air,\r\nover a most beautiful country, and enjoyed ourselves to the full, to her\r\ngreat advantage; also mine. Then we cut across the State to\r\nPennsylvania, visited the coal region of north Pennsylvania; traveled\r\nvery leisurely; passed through New York, seeing the Torreys three hours,\r\nand so to Litchfield, Connecticut, where Mrs. G. is left, and I am at\r\nhome, to set to work again, having done nothing in botany except to\r\nteach since last April.\r\n\r\nNow I am going to set to work as soon as correspondence is cleared off.\r\n\r\nI found here also a letter from Dr. Parry,[48] and have named the\r\nspecimens in both, sending the answer to you for forwarding, also Dr.\r\nParry’s letter to me.\r\n\r\nHe can’t miss it if he keeps at work between Denver and Salt Lake,\r\nclimbing to truly alpine regions as often as he can.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker sent me last spring a fine cast of a bust of Robert Brown.\r\nTo-day I have also from him a splendid one of his father, Sir William.\r\nTell Fendler that Mr. Shaw should procure both if possible for the\r\nLibrary of Hort. Bot., Missouri.\r\n\r\nWhat next? A young gardener has found a locality of Calluna vulgaris,\r\ncovering almost an acre, within twenty-five miles of Boston; a case to\r\nadd to Scolopendrium, Marsilea, etc., but most of all, striking and\r\nunexpected. It grows in low ground, and has every appearance of being\r\nindigenous.\r\n\r\nAugust 27.\r\n\r\nI hope and trust that Frémont will be strong enough to keep the war out\r\nof your neighborhood. The citizens of Missouri ought to volunteer in\r\nsuch numbers as to keep the rebels out of the State and keep the State\r\ntrue and firm in the Union. It is the cheapest and most honorable way,\r\nand will save property, avoid distress, etc.\r\n\r\nThis rebellion is certainly going to be put down, no matter at what\r\ncost, and property at St. Louis will be worth more than ever yet before\r\nyou and I reach three score and ten.\r\n\r\nNovember 11.\r\n\r\nI think very little of Unionists who have been “made Secessionists” by\r\nanything. What matter whether you have one fifth, one tenth, or\r\nfour fifths Unionists, if they will not fight to put down\r\nSecessionists,--they might as well be Secessionists out and out.\r\nMaryland and Missouri will not and must not be allowed to secede or to\r\ndo seceders’ work, cost what it will. And it is a great blessing to them\r\nthat we restrain them. The Union must be preserved; suffering is a very\r\nsmall matter in comparison--all must take their part, and the rebels\r\nmust suffer hard till they give up. We are only beginning to fight. If\r\nMissouri wanted security she should have put down her secessionists\r\nherself with the strong hand, at the beginning. So of Kentucky. But she\r\nhas been forced to find out and feel her duty and her honor, and to act.\r\n\r\nGod save the Union, and confusion to all traitors.\r\n\r\nTO DANIEL CADY EATON.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 4, 1861.\r\n\r\nYour three parcels and letter of October first have duly come. I believe\r\nI never answered your note of August 28.\r\n\r\nI can’t abide writing letters nowadays. But I think often of you. You\r\nare happy in being able to do something direct. I wish I could. Find me\r\na useful place in the army, and I will go at once.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I have scraped up $550, all we can scrape, and lent it to\r\nthe United States. I am amazed that people do not come forward with\r\ntheir money--those that can’t go to fight. I wish I could do both....\r\n\r\nI have to-day a letter from Wright, September 4. He is of late\r\nbotanizing with more spirit than formerly.\r\n\r\nA sailing-vessel is up here for Santiago. I shall write by it, the\r\nUnited States mail by steamer being so interrupted, and perhaps send\r\nsome publications, newspapers, etc. But I shall leave for you to send\r\nthe “Flora of the British West Indies,” as you suggest. I could not\r\nspare my copy....\r\n\r\nI hope this taking up of large transport vessels means something, and\r\nsomething prompt and thorough.\r\n\r\nThus far one is sick and sad, so little is done.\r\n\r\nI had some hopes that your good father would be put at the head of the\r\nCommissary Department. I trust he will get promotion somewhat according\r\nto his deserts anyhow. Oh for faithful and honest officers and\r\nofficials!...\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 15, 1862.\r\n\r\nI do not like to write to you much about the war, and that is much\r\nreason why I have not sooner replied to yours of December 9.\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law and his cousin are both officers in Burnside’s\r\nexpedition, which we expect will do something.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gray and I send warmest New Year greetings to you and Mrs. E., and\r\nhope you may feel all right and country safe in 1863.\r\n\r\nFebruary 20.\r\n\r\nBravo for Illinois, to which victory at Fort Donelson is due, and bravo\r\nfor Tennessee and Alabama full of Union men! Does not your old\r\nUnion blood rise? Pray, now drop all your let-treason-alone,\r\ndo-nothing-disorganizing notions, and go in for the country, the whole\r\ncountry, reinstate it first, and then we will all go in and make it what\r\nit should be. The ungenerous conduct of England shows what a condition\r\nwe should be in as a fraction, and she playing off one portion against\r\nthe other, and bullying both.\r\n\r\nI pray Congress to put on taxes, five per cent direct on property and\r\nincome, and heavy indirect besides. What is property! I would fight till\r\nevery cent is gone, and would offer my own life freely; so I do not\r\nvalue the lives or property of rebels above my own. God bless you.\r\n\r\nMay 22.\r\n\r\nA most lovely spring here. We all flourish and prosper, and rejoice in\r\nthe strengthening of our national power, and advancing restoration of\r\nthe Union, with hopes of hanging leaders of the rebellion, exiling a\r\ngood many, and pardoning all the rank and file who will come back with a\r\ngood grace to their allegiance. If they will not, let them beware! Væ\r\nvictis to such.\r\n\r\nThe country is to be kept in the Union. If the people choose to stay,\r\nlet them, and peace be with them. If they wish to emigrate, very well.\r\nThe North, aided by immigrating Teutons, has great colonizing power, and\r\nwe can rapidly settle Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi, etc.\r\n\r\nThere, this is enough for the present to rile you.\r\n\r\nAs to Euphorbias, the published names here must take precedence to\r\nunpublished names of Shuttleworth, etc.\r\n\r\nEver your most peaceful friend,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 10, 1860.\r\n\r\nThanks for very interesting letter of September 10. I am much pressed\r\nnow, or would write a long gossiping letter. The bound copy of “Origin”\r\nis just received from Murray. Many thanks....\r\n\r\nI believe I have seen a pod or two of Horseradish; but they are rare.\r\nYour germinations show curious resemblance of dimorphic-crosses with\r\nhybrid-crosses, as shown by Naudin; very interesting and capital points\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nJanuary (?), 1862.\r\n\r\nI imagine it is now universally felt here that if we do not do it [i.\r\ne., carry on the fighting] we shall have to eat much dirt; that the\r\nestablishment of a rival power on our long southern line of the free\r\nStates, to be played off against us, is not to be submitted to if it\r\ncan be prevented at any sacrifice. God help us, indeed, if our honorable\r\nexistence is to have no better safeguard than the generosity or sense of\r\njustice of more powerful nations! As to slavery, the course of things is\r\ngetting to meet your views, as it is clear must be, if the South\r\ncontinues obstinate. If they give up war they may save their institution\r\nin their own States, to have the chance of abolishing it themselves in\r\nthe only safe and easy way, with time and the gradual competition of\r\nwhite labor. But obstinate resistance will surely bring on wide-sweeping\r\nmanumission.\r\n\r\nYou see that we are not going to have war [with England] at present. And\r\nit appears that the decision of our government will be as unitedly and\r\nthoroughly sustained by the whole people as if it had been the other\r\nway; contrary to Mr. Russell’s prediction, and to our dear friend Dr.\r\nBoott’s, who writes about our “mob” in a way he would not if he were\r\nhere to see. Look at an English mob urging up their government so that\r\nthey felt obliged to back up their demands, with a menacing force on our\r\nborders; and making such a peremptory demand as you justly say,\r\n“entirely on Wilkes’ acting as judge;” a matter which our government\r\nwould as promptly concede as yours could ask.\r\n\r\nSeemann[49] wrote me that the general belief at the clubs and in the\r\nCity was that our government wanted to get into war with England for an\r\nexcuse to give up the South. A pretty idea they must have of our wisdom\r\nand discretion! Dear Boott is firmly convinced that we have all along\r\nbeen trying to quarrel with England. The belief here is nearly\r\nuniversal the other way, and those who like England best, and perhaps\r\nthe coolest and best-informed men, have been more and more dissatisfied\r\nas time went on.\r\n\r\nWhat has caused this lamentable state of things, this complete\r\nmisunderstanding? Plainly this: the secessionists in England have\r\nadroitly managed the matter and led public opinion in various lines, but\r\nall in one direction, inimical to us; and they did not think it too\r\ngreat a stretch to make John Bull believe that we were insane enough to\r\nwant an English quarrel. In this they have been ably seconded by a few\r\npapers here, mainly by those whose loyalty is deeply suspected, and\r\nwhose influence is as nothing; which are nearly as scurrilous as the\r\n“Saturday Review,” with no redeeming ability, and you have the result.\r\n\r\nWill the evidence that this mail carries satisfy the English that we\r\nwant to live in peace with them?\r\n\r\nBut as to good feeling, I am afraid it is too late to expect that.\r\n\r\nWe were hurt at first by your putting our rebels on the same footing as\r\na government with which yours was in most amicable relations,--and by\r\nthe general assumption at once that we were gone past redemption, by the\r\nfailure to see that the power had gone from the hands of those who were\r\nalways making trouble with your government in some petty way or other,\r\netc., till I think it is generally believed that the governing influence\r\nin England desires to have us a weak and divided people, and would do a\r\ngood deal to secure it.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that this is the general feeling; and this is now very\r\nmuch intensified.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of many are very hostile, and they would like to be strong\r\nthat they might show it. Those of others, who have been exceedingly fond\r\nof England, always defending her when possible, and these are mine, are,\r\nthat we must be strong to be secure and respected,--natural selection\r\nquickly crushes out weak nations; that we have tried long enough to have\r\nintimate relations between the governments, or the peoples in general.\r\nNaturalists, etc., being enlightened people, can be as intimate as they\r\nlike; but nationally let each say, “God bless you, and let us see as\r\nlittle of each other as possible,” each going our own way.\r\n\r\nWell, enough of this.\r\n\r\nSome of the representations of us in the English papers would be amusing\r\nif they did not now do so great harm. One would think it was generally\r\nthought that there was no law and order here, nor gentlemanly conduct,\r\nnor propriety of deportment among the poorer and laboring people. I wish\r\nyou could come and see. As to such things, and as to intelligence,\r\neducation, etc., I have sometimes thought of the picture one could draw\r\nfrom individual cases. Take one--very confidentially--for I would not\r\nhurt a really good fellow by exposing his ignorance of what he might be\r\nexpected to know. Here we lately had a Cambridge graduate (F. L. S., and\r\ngodson of an English baronet) who in one conversation let us know most\r\nfrankly that he had no idea where Quito was, or that there were two\r\nhouses of Congress in the United States, and was puzzled to know whether\r\nBoston, United States, time was faster or slower than that of\r\nGreenwich!...\r\n\r\nFebruary 18, 1862.\r\n\r\nAccept a hasty line at the present, when I am busy above measure.\r\n\r\nThanks for the Primula paper, which I have barely looked over.\r\n\r\nI do hope that you and the other fourteen of your household are out of\r\nbed and done with influenza.\r\n\r\nAs I have not given you up notwithstanding your very shocking principles\r\nand prejudices against design in nature, so we shall try to abide your\r\nlongitudinarian defection. I suppose it is longitude, and I am sorry to\r\nsee that there is a wide and general desire in that meridian that we\r\n(United States) should fall to pieces. But the more you want us to, the\r\nmore we won’t, and the more important it appears to us that we should be\r\na strong and unbroken power. God help us, if we do not keep strong\r\nenough, at whatever cost now it may be, to resist the influence of a\r\ncountry which looks upon the continuation of our steady policy to\r\nprotect and diversify our domestic industry as a wrong and sin against\r\nit. No, no, we must have our own way. But the triumph of the Republicans\r\nwas the political destruction of the very people who were always making\r\ntrouble with England, and, if you would only let us and have some faith\r\nin the North, we should have been permanently on the best of terms.\r\n\r\nWhat you complain of in the Boston dinner[50] was indeed lamentable;\r\nsuch men should not have talked bosh, even at a little private ovation,\r\nand we have reason to know some of them were heartily ashamed of it as\r\nsoon as they saw it in print. It was immediately spoken of here, by\r\ninfluential people, some of whom refused to attend the dinner, and in\r\nat least one paper, in a tone like your own. It was really as bad as the\r\nspeeches of some members of Parliament, and worse because it was\r\nfoolish.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, a set of cunning fellows on both sides of the water (but\r\nhere utterly characterless) have contrived to make both English and\r\nYankees believe that each was bent upon quarreling with the other.\r\n\r\nYour thinking of me “as an Englishman” would once have been a\r\ncompliment, and is what from my well-known feelings and expressions I\r\nhave passed for among my friends here. Had the North gone on giving in\r\nto the South as for years past, I should have been one, at least in\r\nresidence, just as soon as I could have got out of the country. I thank\r\nGod, it has been otherwise, and that I have a country to be proud of,\r\nand which I will gladly suffer for, if need be. With all its weakness\r\nand follies (and I know them well) I go for my country, and to be\r\nfriendly with those we ought to be on good terms with. I am cured of\r\nsome illusions. We shall do very well, and the two countries will be on\r\nthe best of terms when we are strong; till then we must not expect it.\r\n\r\nIf it is the old question of struggle for life, good feeling has not\r\nmuch to do with it: the weak must go to the wall, because it can’t help\r\nit. “Blessed are the _strong_, for they shall inherit the earth.”\r\n\r\nMy wife, who is loath to strike you from her books, begs you to make\r\nallowances for the people here, who were so very cocky at having caught\r\ntwo such ineffable scamps as Mason and Slidell, whom we have reason to\r\nhate with perfect hatred; that they thought of nothing else, and did not\r\nmean to be saucy to England. But you have made us sore, there is no\r\ndenying it. We did not allow enough for longitude.\r\n\r\nHer former message did not refer to Boott (though he is unfortunately\r\ninfluenced by longitude; but is a Yankee born), nor to Hooker, who,\r\nGallio fashion, cares for none of these things; thinks us unwise for\r\nfighting, I presume; but we perfectly agree to say nothing about such\r\nmatters. It is odd that you all fail to appreciate that it is simply a\r\nstruggle for existence on our part, and that men will persist in\r\nthinking their existence of some consequence to themselves, though you\r\nprove the contrary ever so plain; and will strike or grasp or kick,\r\nright and left, in an undignified way sometimes; which the safe and\r\nsound bystander, coolly looking on, may not appreciate, not sharing his\r\nfeelings, telling him the world will get on quite as well without him;\r\nyet he somehow does not quite like it.\r\n\r\nMarch 6.\r\n\r\nI have your note of February 16, about Melastomaceæ. The test of a good\r\ntheory is said to be its power of predicting. If your speculations lead\r\nyou to predict the style curved to one side in Melastomaceæ, and the\r\nprediction is verified, that will be a great matter in your favor. Why,\r\nyou are coming out so strong in final causes that they should make a D.\r\nD. of you at Cambridge!\r\n\r\nI shall be pleased if I can help you about Rhexia. R. Virginica grows\r\nnot far from here, and I will set to watching it next summer. But I fear\r\nit may not help you, as it is stated in our “Flora of North America” to\r\nhave “anthers uniform.” I see, however, the phrase, “style somewhat\r\ndeclined,” in the character; which must be looked to. The character was\r\ndrawn wholly from dried specimens. I have good details from fresh ones\r\ndrawn by Mr. Sprague, but cannot just now lay hands on them.\r\n\r\nFreely point out anything else you want looked at. I have now a very\r\nzealous pupil, who will be glad to be intrusted with looking up plants\r\nand observing.\r\n\r\nEver yours, cordially,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nThere is some jolly science in the “Saturday Review,” now and then; as\r\nin December 28, p. 665, where we are informed that icebergs “are formed\r\nby the splashing of the waves on the coast of Labrador.”\r\n\r\nMill being “the greatest logician in England,” I send you an American\r\nreprint of a specimen of his logic, which I know you will like.\r\n\r\nWe are very sad here at the death of the president of our\r\nuniversity,[51] who had also many warm friends in England.\r\n\r\nMarch 31.\r\n\r\nYours of the 15th came this evening. To-morrow I am busy all day in\r\ncollege (where I began my course this year with lectures on\r\nFertilization, developing your views on orchid-insect fertilization,\r\ndimorphism, etc., etc., to an interested class!), so I must drop a line\r\nfor you into a letter for Boott, for Wednesday’s post.\r\n\r\nA friend has just handed me Morell’s new book, which, looking at\r\npsychology from the physiological side, I see brings up several notions\r\nwhich have been turning over in my mind for some years. He is coming out\r\na good Darwinian, I see, and is quite of my way of thinking about\r\ndesign. You see I am determined to baptize [“The Origin of Species”],\r\nnolens volens, which will be its salvation. But if you won’t have it\r\ndone, it will be damned, I fear....\r\n\r\nThings move on here, on the whole, very well.\r\n\r\nYes, I will promise not to hate you; quite the contrary!\r\n\r\nOur sensitiveness as to England was the natural result of the strong\r\nfilial feeling on our part. It was very undignified, I dare say. But I\r\nthink we are getting bravely over it, and getting really not to care\r\nwhat the Old Country may think or say, so it lets us alone.\r\n\r\nAs to Rebeldom, there is now hardly any State that we have not got some\r\nfoothold in.\r\n\r\nI do not do so much scientific work as before the war, but still I keep\r\npottering away. From now till July, I can expect to do little besides my\r\ncollege duties. Ever, dear Darwin, your cordial friend and true Yankee,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nMay 18.\r\n\r\nYesterday came by post the sheets B-I of your Orchid book.\r\n\r\nThis evening (Sunday) I have opened the parcel and read introduction and\r\nchapter i. What a charming book it is! You are right in issuing it in\r\nthis form. It would be a sin not to do so.\r\n\r\nI fear, though, that no publisher would reprint it here; though I may,\r\non reading farther, conclude to offer it to the Appletons, who should\r\nhave the refusal. But it will surely be popular in England, where\r\norchids are popular and the species known to most intelligent and\r\neducated people. I hope soon to get the other sheets. I am perfectly\r\ndelighted with O. pyramidalis, and must extract the whole account of\r\nits fertilization for “Silliman’s Journal.”\r\n\r\nOur only orchis, that is, O. spectabilis, I brought last summer from\r\nwestern New York, and planted. I shall in a week have three or four\r\nspikes coming into flower, and I will cover one and leave the others\r\nexposed. They are in a wooded part of the garden, like their natural\r\nhabitat. The rest of our Ophrydeæ are Habenarias (Platanthera).\r\n\r\nI must recur to your letter about Cypripedium and see what you wanted of\r\nit, that is, what observation.\r\n\r\nIf there be any adaptation, be it ever so pretty, I shall never see it\r\nwithout your direction. What a skill and genius you have for these\r\nresearches! Even for the structure of the flower of the Ophrydeæ I have\r\nto-night learned more than I ever knew before.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 26, 1861.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--My duties in the university at this season are very\r\npressing. Besides, we are now opening a war, upon the determination of\r\nwhich our very existence depends, and upon which we are to concentrate\r\nall our strength and soul, so I have no time nor heart to write of\r\nbotany just now....\r\n\r\nEver, dear De Candolle, yours most cordially,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nDecember 16.\r\n\r\nWe do not often exchange letters now, and in these for us trying times\r\nin the United States, though far removed from the actual scenes of war,\r\nand not much interrupted in my botanical studies, except by distracting\r\nthoughts, I write as few letters as I can. The unfriendly attitude of\r\nEngland gives us much concern. Were it not for that, it is thought we\r\nshould soon put an end to our rebellion. But I will not write of such\r\nmatters now.\r\n\r\nJuly 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nNo fear about our army, now so great. It is largely composed of\r\nmaterials such as nothing but a high sense of duty could keep for a year\r\nin military life. It will dissolve like last winter’s snow when no more\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nWhile I write, a great battle is in progress, decisive if we gain it and\r\ntake the rebel capital, simply prolonging the strife if we do not. We\r\ncan raise at once another army if need be; and yet another. Indeed\r\n300,000 more men are now to be accepted, to recruit our ranks and make a\r\nsure thing of the result.\r\n\r\nConfident of our cause, we expect confidently the favor of\r\nProvidence....\r\n\r\nWhat a charming book is that of Darwin on orchid fertilization!\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 17, 1862.\r\n\r\nI am at work in college now, you know, and it is very hard work. This\r\nlast vacation I had to make a new edition and new additions to my\r\n“Manual,” etc., and to do it in a hurry, and I have at length, for the\r\nfirst time, found out that I am growing old. In fact I broke down under\r\nit, and have injured my health a little.... I doubt if I ever recover\r\nthe spring and vim of former times. But we shall see....\r\n\r\nMy hard work has got correspondence all horridly behindhand, and\r\ndetermined me to draw in my horns, and drop a good deal of it. My desk\r\nhas long been so covered deep with unanswered letters, etc., that I have\r\nabandoned it, and now sit over on the other side of the table.\r\n\r\nIf I sit down and answer a letter right off the day it comes, as I am\r\nnow doing with yours, and as I do with purely business letters, etc.,\r\nthen it is safe. If I add it to the heap, it is a gone case, and I fear\r\nwill never be really answered.\r\n\r\nEaton, too, as you know, has been very hard worked, in his father’s\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nWell, there is no State now in some part of which the star-spangled\r\nbanner does not float. Lincoln is a trump, a second Washington, steady,\r\nconservative, no fanatical abolitionist. Foote, of your State of\r\nConnecticut, is putting down his foot on the Mississippi. McClellan is\r\nto fight a great battle at Yorktown. Another bloody battle may be fought\r\nnear Corinth, Mississippi. New Orleans will soon be ours, please God,\r\nand then this wicked rebellion will be done for. I pray God I may live\r\nto see the end of it, and the States brought back, quietly if they will,\r\nforcibly if they must.\r\n\r\nI know it will rejoice your heart to see the thing done. And it will be\r\nworth all it costs.\r\n\r\nCome now, here is a good long letter for a man as tired as I to write,\r\nwho has been five or six hours in lecture-room, working hard.\r\n\r\nAugust 1.\r\n\r\nHere is a bit of reading for you,--substitute for letters, which in\r\ntruth I have not surfeited you with lately. Who can write letters in\r\nthese trying times?...\r\n\r\nLast spring my health felt pretty seriously impaired. But by end of\r\nJune I was able to diminish my college work a little, and take the rest\r\neasier, and so now I feel very much better, more like my old self, and I\r\nam beginning to clear off my table that I may get at work again on that\r\neverlasting South Pacific Exploring Expedition.\r\n\r\nThere is a charming book out, by Darwin, on the fertilization of orchids\r\nby insects. It will open your eyes to most curious things. I have\r\nverified much myself here, and made observations which Darwin regards as\r\nvery interesting. I send you a copy of the book through Eaton, as a\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAny observations or notes you make I will send to Darwin.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nJuly 2, 1862.\r\n\r\nI am glad if my off-hand orchid notes interest you, or prove of the\r\nleast use. I am daily expecting a copy to send you of my notice of the\r\nearly chapters of your book. I will continue in the ensuing number. And\r\nwhatever of the notes I send you seem to you worth touching upon, you\r\nhave only to indicate them, and send back my memoranda, and I will take\r\nthem up. But as to Cypripediums, I should like to have an opportunity of\r\nexamining them (except C. acaule) more at large, and growing.\r\n\r\nA week from to-morrow, I expect to be able to leave Cambridge, to go\r\ndown, with my examination papers to read, to my beau-père’s place on the\r\nshore, for a few days. Then I will try to look up and bring home living\r\nRhexia Virginica; and also I expect to have a look at Calopogon\r\npulchellus, with its strong bearded labellum. And I hope it will not be\r\ntoo late to get plenty of Mitchella repens, which my pupils do not\r\nbring me in as they ought. I want to see if long-styled stigma and short\r\ndiffer, and also the pollen of the two, as they do in Houstonia, of\r\nwhich I hope I sent you Rothrock’s[52] observations. At least I will\r\nsend when he has completed them.\r\n\r\nPrecocious fertilization in the bud was much noticed here very long ago\r\nby Torrey, in Viola, Specularia, etc., etc., also in Impatiens, about\r\nwhich see my “Genera Illustrata,” volume ii. I once mentioned it to you\r\nas good evidence of close fertilization. As to pollen-tubes of such, I\r\nhave no observations of my own, but a memory or fancy that they were\r\nshown to me by Torrey. I will ask him, and have him look at Specularia.\r\n\r\nAs to the French lady’s translation and commentary on the “Origin,” I am\r\nnot so much surprised. As I view it, there are only two sides to the\r\nmain question. Very likely she takes one side in a thorough-going and\r\nconsistent manner; and either she is right, or I am right, i. e., there\r\nis design in nature, or there is not. The no-design view, if one can\r\nbring himself to entertain it, may well enough lead to all she says, and\r\nwe may very much admire how collision and destruction of least-favored\r\nbrings about apparently orderly results,--apparent contrivances or\r\nadaptation of means to ends. On the other hand, the implication of a\r\ndesigning mind must bring with it a strong implication of design in\r\nmatters where we could not directly prove it.\r\n\r\nIf you grant an intelligent designer anywhere in Nature, you may be\r\nconfident that he has had something to do with the “contrivances” in\r\nyour orchids.\r\n\r\nI have just received and glanced at Bentham’s address, and am amused to\r\nsee how your beautiful flank movement with the Orchid book has nearly\r\novercome his opposition to the “Origin.”\r\n\r\nThe military simile above leads me to speak of your wonder that I can\r\nthink of science at all in the midst of war. Well, first, we get used to\r\nit. Second, we need something to turn to, and happy are they who,\r\nforbidden to engage personally in the war (as I am ever itching to do),\r\nhave something to turn to. Third, I do not do much, do nothing, in fact,\r\nexcept my college duties now for months, and that is the reason I have\r\ntime to write to you, and be interested in all your doings.\r\n\r\nIf you suppose everything is paralyzed and desolate here, and the\r\ncountry greatly put back, read a very sensible letter of an Englishman\r\nin the “Spectator” of June 7. It is very just and true. We shall\r\nrecuperate fast enough, and be better off than ever, as much prosperity\r\nas is good for us, and more solid, more independent, more\r\nself-contained, which is our great desideratum. Free trade be blowed; we\r\nmust needs have high duties on imports, and it is better that we should.\r\nBy these and by direct taxes--the tax-bill just passed--we shall have to\r\npay over largely. Very well.\r\n\r\nJust at present our prospects (viz., evening of July 3) are looking\r\nbadly enough. McClellan has clearly been overmatched and driven to the\r\nwall, after very obstinate fighting, with very heavy loss on both sides.\r\nWhether it is retrievable with reinforcements, or whether the whole\r\ncampaign has to be begun again against Richmond, is not yet clear.\r\nAnyway we have got to put shoulder to the wheel anew, and it may be\r\ndone, we suppose, more easily and far more promptly than last year. All\r\nwe ask is that Europe shall let us alone.\r\n\r\nEnough for to-day.\r\n\r\nPROVIDENCE, R. I., July 29, 1862.\r\n\r\nNo more news in the orchids line. I am making two or three days of\r\nholiday, and yesterday I found a few specimens of Gymnadenia tridentata.\r\nBut the flowers are too small to examine well with a hand lens. If they\r\nkeep, I will take them back to Cambridge in a day or two and see what to\r\nmake of them....\r\n\r\nAs to the country, you will see by this time that we have not the least\r\nidea of abandoning the struggle. We have learned only that there is no\r\nuse trying any longer to pick up our eggs gently, very careful not to\r\nbreak any. The South forces us at length to do what it would have been\r\nmore humane to have done from the first, i. e., to act with vigor, not\r\nto say rigor.\r\n\r\nWe shall be complained of for our savageness, no doubt, whereas we feel\r\nthat our error has been all the other way. But the independence, the\r\ntotal indifference to English feeling which you recommended last year,\r\nhas come at length; now we care nothing what Mrs. Grundy says.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, September 22, 1862.\r\n\r\nYour pleasant epistles of August 21 and September 4 are to be\r\nacknowledged, with thanks. But I have nothing in particular to\r\ncommunicate, except our hearty congratulations that your boy and Mrs.\r\nDarwin are recovering so well.\r\n\r\nTell Leonard that I was pleased both with his attention in writing and\r\nwith the ocular proof of his convalescence in his being able so soon to\r\nuse a pen. His requests shall be kept in view; the five-cent stamp I\r\nsend now; dare say I shall sometime pick up the thirty and ninety,\r\nthough I never saw the latter, nor the twelve, twenty, and twenty-four\r\non envelopes (the twenty-four cent he must have already, as it is often\r\nused on my envelopes to you).\r\n\r\nBravo for Horace, whose illustration of Natural Selection as to the\r\nadders is capital. A chip of the old block, he evidently is.\r\n\r\nI told you that Rothrock had gone to the war, and perhaps has already\r\nbeen under fire; probably not. I had intended that next spring he should\r\ndo up Houstonia more perfectly, and work up this and some related\r\nmatters for his thesis when he comes up for examination. But all this is\r\nbroken up by his enlistment....\r\n\r\nI have been lazy about all my writing, working all day at dry and dull\r\nsystematic botany, which you anathematize. But if I get time to turn it\r\nover, I will say a few words on the last chapter of your Orchid book.\r\nBut it opens up a knotty sort of question about accident or design,\r\nwhich one does not care to meddle with much until one can feel his way\r\nfurther than I can.\r\n\r\nOctober 4, 1862.\r\n\r\nI have just been reading Max Müller’s lecture on the Science of Language\r\nwith much interest. But perhaps what has interested me most is, after\r\nall, his perfect appreciation and happy use of Natural Selection, and\r\nthe very complete analogy between diversification of species and\r\ndiversification of language. I can hardly think of any publication which\r\nin England could be more useful to your cause than this volume is, or\r\nshould be. I see also with what great effect you may use it in our\r\noccasional discussion about design; indeed I hardly see how to avoid\r\nconclusion adverse to special design, though I think I see indications\r\nof a way out.\r\n\r\nDepend on it, Max Müller will be of real service to you.\r\n\r\nOctober 13.\r\n\r\nI have been so much occupied that I deferred to the last moment to write\r\nout my second notice of your Orchid book for “Silliman’s Journal.” I\r\nwrote out Saturday evening what I could, and to-day have finished and\r\nsent off my manuscript to New Haven. The greater part consists of a\r\nrecord of some of my observations last summer, very hurriedly penned,\r\nand sent off. I trust you will be pleased, and will think that my little\r\ncontributions cannot be better hatched than under your wings.\r\n\r\nI hope that my young correspondent is fast recovering strength. Tell him\r\nthat I have no more stamps for him yet, but shall pick up his desiderata\r\none of these days.\r\n\r\nI have some nice live roots of Cypripedium, two or three species to send\r\nyou, and mean to send Mitchella.\r\n\r\nHow Hooker does praise up your book, in the “Gardener’s Chronicle!”\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, November 10, 1862.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to me that you find the special correspondent of the\r\n“Times” detestable.\r\n\r\nYour comments upon our affairs always show such a good spirit that you\r\nneed not fear even my wife’s “indignation.”\r\n\r\nWe are sorry that you suffer in England; but you must blame the rebels\r\nfor it, not us, and your Manchester people should have looked earlier to\r\nIndia for cotton.\r\n\r\nYou don’t see, as you would if here, the total impossibility of coming\r\nto any terms of peace with the South, based on their independence.\r\nBefore that can be they or we must be thoroughly beaten. You can’t be\r\nexpected to see too, what seems plain to me, that you English would give\r\nus no end of trouble if we attempt a piecemeal existence. We must be\r\nstrong enough to keep any Old-World power at bay. Then we shall behave\r\npretty well, on the whole; surely so when the North is dominant and is\r\nfairly treated. “Seizing on Canada.” What do we want of Canada? When the\r\nSouth was aggressive and making slave States we often looked to the\r\npeaceful acquisition of Canada as desirable, as a counterpoise. But when\r\nwe had “changed all that,”--and it is changed, and slavery limited, past\r\nall doubt, however the combat ends,--we no longer have use or need of\r\nCanada. If we get set up again, we have work enough at home, and our\r\nhands full for years; we shall be strong for defense, but weak for\r\naggression. The ill-feeling to England will die out when we are well\r\nable to defend ourselves and our home interests.\r\n\r\nIt does seem that all England wishes us to be weak and divided; perhaps\r\nthat is good national policy. But the more that is so, the more\r\nnecessary it is for us to vindicate our integrity, at whatever cost. Let\r\nus have it out now, even at the cost of ten times what it has cost so\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nI never thought anything of American institutions for England.\r\nAristocracy is a natural and needful appendage to monarchy. You work out\r\nyour own type, and you will liberalize fast enough, and leave us to do\r\nours. We’ll make it do, with some jangling.\r\n\r\nI wish we could be shut up, like the Japanese of old, for ten or twenty\r\nyears, only with a weekly mail from you and Dr. Hooker. Well, well!\r\n\r\nEver yours cordially,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nNovember 24.\r\n\r\nAbout Max Müller; surely you can’t wonder that the attempt to account\r\nfor the “first origin of language,” or of anything else, should be the\r\n“least satisfactory.”\r\n\r\nThe use that I fancied could be made of Max Müller’s book, or rather of\r\nthe history of language, is something more than illustration, but only a\r\nlittle more; that is, you may point to analogies of development and\r\ndiversification of language, of no value at all in evidence in support\r\nof your theory, but good and pertinent as rebutting objections urged\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nBishop Colenso’s book will make a noise in England; indeed, I have only\r\nread the notice in the “Athenæum.”\r\n\r\nYou detest the spirit of the “Times” quoad U. S. The “Athenæum” is just\r\nas bad in its little penny-trumpet way, every chance it can get, from\r\nthe first. Can you be much surprised that we return dislike with\r\ninterest? But we are pleased to find there are sensible and fair\r\nwriters, such as Cairnes and Mill.\r\n\r\nNo, dear Darwin, we don’t scorn your joining in the prayer that we daily\r\noffer that “God would help our poor country,” and I know and appreciate\r\nyour honest and right feeling.\r\n\r\nI see also, from the English papers I read, how you must picture us as\r\nin the extreme of turmoil and confusion and chaos. But if you were here,\r\nyou would open your eyes to see everything going on quietly, hopefully,\r\nand comfortably as possible. I suppose we do not appreciate our\r\nmiseries. We accept our misfortunes and adversities, but mean to\r\nretrieve them, and would sink all that we have before giving up. We work\r\nhard, and persevere, and expect to come out all right, to lay the\r\nfoundations of a better future, no matter if they be laid in suffering.\r\nThat will not hurt us now, and may bring great good hereafter.\r\n\r\nI never saw, and have scarcely heard of, Miss Cooper’s book you ask\r\nafter. She is the daughter of the late J. Fenimore Cooper, the novelist.\r\nThe village she describes must be Cooperstown, New York, in the county\r\nadjacent to that in which I was brought up,--a region which, every time\r\nI visit it, I say it is the fairest of lands, and the people the\r\nhappiest.\r\n\r\nOh, as to the weeds; Mrs. Gray says she allows that our weeds give up to\r\nyours. Ours are modest, woodland, retiring things, and no match for the\r\nintrusive, pretentious, self-asserting foreigners. But I send you seeds\r\nof one native weed which, corrupted by bad company, is as nasty and\r\ntroublesome as any I know, namely, Sicyos angulatus; also of a more\r\ngenteel Cucurbitacea, Echinocystis lobata (the larger seeds). Upon\r\nthese, especially upon the first, I made my observation of tendrils\r\ncoiling to the touch. Put the seeds directly into the ground; they will\r\ncome up in spring, in moist garden soil.\r\n\r\nMy observations were made on a warm, sunny day. I doubt if you have\r\nwarmth and sunshine enough in England to get up a sensible movement.\r\n\r\nMy note about them is in “Proceedings of the American Academy,” iv., p.\r\n98, reprinted in “Silliman’s Journal,” March, 1859, p. 277. I must own\r\nthat upon casually taking them up since, I never have obtained such very\r\ngood results as upon two days of August, 1858.\r\n\r\nUpon gourds affecting each other’s fruits, I have made no observations\r\nat all. I have only referred to that, as a well-known thing, at least,\r\nof common repute here, and then referred to maize, where the soft\r\nsweet-corn, when fertilized by hard yellow-corn, the grain so fertilized\r\ntakes the character of the fertilizer. My note about it is in Academy\r\n“Proceedings,” vol. iv., I think. You have the volumes (which I have not\r\nin reach now), and can find it by the index. It does not amount to much.\r\nNothing on maize I know of except Bonafous’ folio volume. I am going to\r\nget and send you grains of four or five sorts of maize. About the\r\ninvolucrate form, I wrote in my last.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 14th October, 1862.\r\n\r\nDEAR ENGELMANN,--Never mind turmoil. It will come out right. I go\r\nagainst the abolition wing, but support the President in his\r\nProclamation.\r\n\r\nIf the rebels continue obstinate, that is only a question of time. Of\r\nthat, as a military measure, and of the expediency, the President of the\r\nUnited States is the sole judge, and in time of war he is to be\r\nsupported heartily. I myself do not see clearly that the time had come.\r\nBut I have a notion that the President knows better than I.\r\n\r\nAs you like Judge Parker, I will send you an article written before the\r\nProclamation came out. You will like it, all but the last part, the\r\nbitter end. I would continue the war, if necessary, to the sweeping of\r\nall rebeldom bare. And that appears to be the sober sentiment of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIf Judge Parker, etc., had let their convention alone, we would have\r\nousted Sumner for a wiser man. But now I fear that Sumner will be\r\nreturned to the Senate.\r\n\r\nYou had better in Missouri abolish slavery and take United States bonds\r\nin indemnity. You will never do better.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nOctober 13, 1862.\r\n\r\nBoth Torrey and Eaton speak of having your photograph. You cut me, I\r\nsuppose, because I am such a poor correspondent! I am afraid I deserve\r\nit, but what can a poor fellow do in such times as these?...\r\n\r\nA fruit, one of a dozen ripened here this season in the Garden, has such\r\na tropical look and taste that it reminded me of you. It is Asimina\r\ntriloba! Tastes like a rich custard into which a piece of scented soap\r\nhas fallen....\r\n\r\nGeneral Stuart with his cavalry has been cutting all round McClellan’s\r\narmy again. Next time, I expect they will make a circuit as far round as\r\nBoston, or at least Connecticut, and carry off the horses. They are more\r\nin earnest than we are; but we shall use them up at length.\r\n\r\nNovember 14.\r\n\r\nHere I was this afternoon, moiling over your plants, copying out\r\nGrisebach’s manuscripts for the printer (for the printer won’t touch the\r\nDutchy-looking thing; and besides, I have additions to make, etc.), when\r\nI just happened to remember that to-morrow is Havana mail, and that I\r\nwas by all means to write to you to-day. There is still time, so here\r\ngoes.\r\n\r\nFirst, can’t you make some arrangement, while you are at this end of\r\nCuba, to receive a Yankee newspaper by mail; say to the address of Don\r\nJosé Blain, or some Havana address. If you can arrange it that it is not\r\nstopped, I will send you papers regularly; say the little “Boston\r\nHerald,” small, soon read, democratic, patriotic, or others, from time\r\nto time....\r\n\r\nAs to collecting still, I should say, Yes, go on, in a gradual and cheap\r\nway, i. e., do not make very heavy outlays, as long as you are in the\r\ncountry; at least till next summer. For we cannot get the war done until\r\nlate next spring (except in Texas).\r\n\r\nIf you can do as much for western as for eastern Cuba, it will be a good\r\nthing....\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I have money enough for you, if you can only get it....\r\n\r\nBut how can you get it at present rates? Or how can I get it to you? If\r\ngreenbacks would pass there as here, it would be easy enough.\r\n\r\nIs there not some Yankee product that I could ship to you that Blain or\r\nLescaille wants, sewing-machines, agricultural implements, chairs? So we\r\nmight save the loss on exchange. I will send you anything, from a\r\nmouse-trap to a wheelbarrow!\r\n\r\nYou have a letter from me which must have reached you soon after yours\r\nof October 25, saying that my last was eighty-five days old! Indeed,\r\nyou ought to have had it then....\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nJanuary 27, 1863.\r\n\r\nI have been far too busy to write letters; have been interrupted, too,\r\nby visitors, etc....\r\n\r\nYou “wish to heaven the North did not hate us so.” We equally wish the\r\nEnglish did not hate us so. Perhaps we exaggerate the ill will in\r\nEngland against us. You certainly over-estimate that of the United\r\nStates against England, which an influential part of your press\r\nexaggerates and incites for the worst purposes. But, after all, after\r\nthe first flurry, we think and say very little about you, and shall live\r\nin peace with you, if you will let us. There should have been, and might\r\nhave been, the most thorough good will between us. I do not think it is\r\nall our fault that it is not so.\r\n\r\nIn reply to your question:--\r\n\r\nIf oak and beech had large, colored corolla, etc., I know of no reason\r\nwhy it would be reckoned a low form, but the contrary, quite. But we\r\nhave no basis for high or low in any class, say, dicotyledons, except\r\nperfection of development or the contrary in the floral organs, and even\r\nthe envelopes; and as we know these may be reduced to any degree in any\r\norder or group, we have really, that I know of, no philosophical basis\r\nfor high and low. Moreover, the vegetable kingdom does not culminate, as\r\nthe animal kingdom does. It is not a kingdom, but a commonwealth; a\r\ndemocracy, and therefore puzzling and unaccountable from the former\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nI have just read De Candolle’s paper on oaks and species, and origin.\r\nWell, he has got on about as far towards you as I have. It is clear\r\nenough that, as I thought at first, derivation of species is to be the\r\nword, and natural selection admitted. The only question is, whether this\r\nis enough.\r\n\r\nEver your attached friend,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to join issue with you on the question of Linnæus’\r\ndefinition of species. I have long pondered your discussion of the\r\nsubject in “Géographie Botanique,” and still think, on the supposition\r\nof the fixity of species (which Linnæus of course had in view), that\r\nbetween “community of descent” and “likeness,” the former and not the\r\nlatter is the fundamental conception in the idea of species. We may test\r\nthis by inquiring whether of the two can be derived from the other. The\r\nlikeness, I suppose, is the consequence of the community of descent.\r\nBut, then, as the likeness is a thing of degrees, and, according to\r\npresent probabilities, species may have only a relative and temporary\r\nfixity, your view will after all have the advantage; and the question of\r\nspecies will come to be metaphysical or logical, rather than\r\nnatural-historical. The worst of all is that there will remain no\r\nobjective basis or standard; and species will be what each naturalist\r\nthinks best so to consider!\r\n\r\nI am pleased to know that the view of my article on the “Memoirs”[53] is\r\nwell received by you. Readable articles are very needful, when they can\r\nbe had, for a journal which, like Silliman’s, cannot exist without\r\npopular support. I promised an article of sixteen pages of this\r\ncharacter; but I intended to enlarge more at the close upon the genius\r\nand influence of your father, and cite your parallel with Linnæus as\r\nportrayed by Fabricius. But I found that my pages were filled before I\r\nwas aware of it, and I had to cut short, much too curtly. It left me\r\nwith a somehow dissatisfied feeling. All your remarks about the\r\ndifference between the profound and the prolific botanists, I agree to;\r\nand I think that both Linnæus and De Candolle had as much genius as\r\nRobert Brown....\r\n\r\nWell, as to origin of species, you have now gone just about as far as I\r\nhave, in Darwinian direction, and both of us have been led step by step\r\nby the facts and probabilities, and have not jumped at conclusions.\r\n\r\nI shall be curious to see Mme. Royer’s book; Darwin has spoken of her.\r\n\r\nUnder my hearty congratulations of Darwin for his striking contributions\r\nto teleology, there is a vein of petite malice, from my knowing well\r\nthat he rejects the idea of design, while all the while he is bringing\r\nout the neatest illustrations of it!\r\n\r\nDid time allow, I should like to write at large upon these enticing\r\ntopics....\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 16, 1863.\r\n\r\nI received this morning a letter from William Short, announcing to me\r\nthe death of his lamented father, our excellent friend, Dr. C. W. Short,\r\nof Louisville, Kentucky, one of our oldest botanists, and one of the\r\nbest of men and kindest of friends. He died on the 7th inst., of a\r\ntyphoid fever, supervening on a severe cold.\r\n\r\nI feel the loss very much. Although we never met, he was one of my most\r\nvalued friends....\r\n\r\nHe always remembered his former correspondence with you with great\r\ninterest, and was particularly pleased when, in my letter, I could give\r\nhim news of you.\r\n\r\nHis herbarium, upon which he bestowed great pains and considerable\r\nexpense, is conditionally bequeathed to the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nOur botanical Nestor is Dr. Darlington. A few months since I had a\r\nletter from him written in as firm a hand as ever; but now he is\r\nprostrated by paralysis, which, however, leaves his mind clear. But he\r\ncannot remain much longer with us. Short and Darlington were both hearty\r\nand true Christian gentlemen.\r\n\r\nApril 28, 1863.\r\n\r\nYour kind letter of the 6th inst. and the photograph were received with\r\nmore gratification than I can well express. Both your handwriting and\r\nyour _carte de visite_ show you to be well and strong, and, please God,\r\nlong may you so continue.\r\n\r\nYour face looks fuller than a dozen years ago, and a bit older, it may\r\nbe, but it recalls your friendly and kindly expression, and is the best\r\nsubstitute I can have for not seeing you again.\r\n\r\nWhat I wrote of our Nestor, Dr. Darlington, as about to be removed from\r\nus, has come to pass. The good old man died, after much suffering from a\r\nparalysis, on Wednesday last, the 22d, as a newspaper slip has apprised\r\nme. He had reached the age of eighty-one. Unless we continue to rank\r\nDr. Bigelow among the botanists, Dr. Torrey, and even myself, now count\r\namong the most advanced in age.\r\n\r\nI am most happy to tell you that Dr. Torrey, whom I lately saw in New\r\nYork, and who last week looked in upon us here for a day, is quite well.\r\n\r\nMrs. Greene is cheerful and busy in carrying out her husband’s bequest\r\nand desires, in favor of the Boston Natural History Society, to whom he\r\nleft his herbarium and botanical library.\r\n\r\nBy Professor George Bond, a colleague and neighbor of mine, our\r\ndistinguished astronomer, and a most worthy, amiable, and modest person,\r\nwhom I hope you may see, I sent out to you a photograph of F. A. Michaux\r\nand of Adrien de Jussieu, which I thought you might like, and which I\r\nhave just had made from daguerreotypes which I induced them to sit for\r\nin Paris in 1851. Bond will be delighted to see Kew again with its vast\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nEver, dear Sir William, yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO MRS. THOMAS P. JAMES.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 30, 1863.\r\n\r\nI had sent some while ago word to Miss Morris that I had a single\r\nseedling Darlingtonia, and should like to know if Dr. Darlington was in\r\ncondition to be interested in it. But she thought the time had passed\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\nHis memory will long be venerated. We, at least, shall not forget him.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago he had sent to me his selected epitaph, and had\r\ndiscussed it. It is natural and characteristic. I should take an\r\ninterest in seeing such an inscription on his tombstone. But, entre\r\nnous, I should not fancy such an one on my own. I should select rather\r\nsome simple line of Holy Writ, expressive of the Christian trust and\r\nfaith, such as our friend died in.\r\n\r\nI had lately been writing brief notices of several of our botanists,\r\ndeceased, for the May number of “Silliman’s Journal” (as you see, I mail\r\na copy just received); and at the time I felt that they probably would\r\nnot be published before there would be another and more distinguished\r\nname to add.\r\n\r\nI shall not wait for the year to come round, but I hope to draw up a\r\nbrief tribute to his memory for the July number of “Silliman’s Journal.”\r\nSo I should be much obliged to you for the dates and other particulars\r\nyou kindly offer to furnish. I hope that autobiography which you are so\r\nfortunate as to possess is of such a character that it may be printed,\r\nand that you will give it along with a little memoir from your own pen.\r\nIt will be quite in your way, and I would rather you should do it than\r\nany one else....\r\n\r\nBy the way, I may as well mention that Dr. Darlington told me that\r\ncertain letters, etc., of Baldwin’s, which he could not print, as they\r\nwere severe on Nuttall, should come into my possession after his own\r\ndeath. You will probably know if any bundle of papers is left, directed\r\nto my charge.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--Argyle’s article on the Supernatural, to which you\r\ncalled my attention a long while ago, I never happened to see till\r\nto-day, when I have read it through. It is quite clever, not deep, but\r\nclear, and I think useful. I see no occasion for finding fault with him,\r\nexcept in his attempts now and then to direct a little odium against\r\nyou, which is unhandsome, for his main points are those I hammered out\r\nin the “Atlantic,” etc.; indeed I see signs of his having read the same.\r\nBut it is hardly fair of him, after expressing his complete conviction\r\nthat where the operation of natural causes can be clearly traced, the\r\nimplication of design, upon its appropriate evidence, is not thereby\r\nrendered less certain or less convincing, to go on to speak of\r\nderivation-doctrine in a way that implies the contrary.\r\n\r\nOf course we believers in real design make the most of your “frank” and\r\nnatural terms, “contrivance, purpose,” etc., and pooh-pooh your\r\nendeavors to resolve such contrivances into necessary results of certain\r\nphysical processes, and make fun of the race between long noses and long\r\nnectaries!\r\n\r\nMarch 23.\r\n\r\nDr. Wyman,[54] who is a sharp fellow, tells me that, on the authority of\r\nthe historian Prescott, the Incas of Peru, for no one knows how long,\r\nmarried their sisters, to keep the perfect purity of the blood. Query:\r\nHow did this strong case of close-breeding operate? Did they run out\r\nthereby? Wyman thinks there is no evidence of it.\r\n\r\nIf it is true, and the Incas stood it for a long course of generations,\r\nyou must look to it, for it will bear hard against your theory of the\r\nnecessity of crossing. If they run out, you will have a good case.\r\n\r\nApril 11.\r\n\r\nYou see that, at length, the thing is nearly done, and, to use the\r\nexpression here, rebeldom is “gone up.”\r\n\r\nYou have long seen, I suppose, that I was right in saying there was but\r\none possible end to the war; also that the continuance for a time or\r\nabolition of slavery depended simply on the rebels,--that if they\r\nobstinately and persistently resisted, slavery was thereby doomed.\r\n\r\nIt has been a long, weary, and trying work. But the country has had the\r\nneeded patience and nerve, and the thing is done, once for all, at great\r\ncost, but to immense and enduring advantage.\r\n\r\nYou are the only Britisher I ever write to on this subject, and, in\r\nfact, for whose opinions about our country I care at all.\r\n\r\nSo I hasten to rejoice with you over the beginning of the end.\r\n\r\nApril 20.\r\n\r\nYou asked me to tell you, when I had read it, what I thought of Sir\r\nCharles Lyell’s book.[55] I have only to-day finished the perusal of the\r\ncopy he kindly sent me, that is, all but half of the matter on glacial\r\nperiod, which I reserve till I can read it more attentively. Throughout\r\nit is a very interesting and to me a very satisfactory book. It is three\r\nbooks: 1. A capital résumé and examination of what we knew about the\r\nevidence of antiquity of man; no evidence we had not read of before, but\r\nvery clearly presented, of course.\r\n\r\n2. A treatise on the glacial period. Out of this I have much to learn,\r\nand must read it all again carefully; of a part I have not yet cut the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n3. On transmutation matters. That part of the book I can judge somewhat\r\nof, and I declare it first-rate. It is just about what I expected, and\r\nis characteristic of the man. I think that you, and Hooker, are\r\nunreasonable in complaining of Lyell that he does not come out\r\n“flat-footed,” as we say, as an advocate of natural-selection\r\ntransmutation. For, 1st, it is evident that though inclined strongly\r\ntowards it he is by no means satisfied that natural selection will do\r\nall the work you put upon it. 2d, he very plainly implies nearly all you\r\nwould have him say. And, 3d, he serves your cause (supposing it to be\r\nwell-founded) quite as effectually, perhaps, by his guarded position, by\r\nhis keeping the position of a judge rather than of an advocate, and by\r\nconsidering still the case as not yet ripe for a decision.\r\n\r\nVery skillfully, too, has he presented the case of transmutation so as\r\nto commend it, as much as possible, to us orthodox people. (Huxley, I\r\nsuppose, whose two books I have not seen, would put it in a way to\r\nfrighten us off.) Indeed, I think he has shown remarkable judgment and\r\ntaste, and will have much success in disarming prejudice. And this is\r\nall you could ask.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on language makes the points I supposed would be made, or\r\nsome of them, but only dips in, leaving more to be said. But this is\r\nrather ticklish ground, for, if we are not careful here, you would get\r\nthe better of us in this field quoad design.\r\n\r\nIf I had got the book three or four weeks earlier I should have worked\r\nin some notice of the last chapter into my review of De Candolle, etc.,\r\non Species, in the May number of “Silliman’s Journal.”\r\n\r\nNow please do not think of being ill this spring, and passing all your\r\nvaluable time, wasting it, at a water-cure.\r\n\r\nI have really, as you see, nothing special to write of this week, and no\r\ntime to read what I have hurriedly penned.\r\n\r\nMay 26.\r\n\r\nYour letter on heterogeny is keen and good; Owen’s rejoinder ingenious.\r\nBut his dissent from your well-put claims of natural selection to\r\nattention and regard is good for nothing except on the admission of the\r\nview that species are somehow derived genealogically; and this I judge,\r\nfrom various of Owen’s statements, that he really in his heart believes\r\nto be the case, and was (as I long ago intimated my suspicions) hunting\r\nabout for some system of derivation, when your book came down upon him\r\nlike a thunderclap.\r\n\r\nWyman, here, is greatly pleased with Huxley’s book on man’s place in\r\nnature. I have not even seen it.\r\n\r\nDid you ever notice how prettily Iris is arranged for cross-fertilizing\r\nby bees, etc.?\r\n\r\nYour Linum paper has long been here. But I have actually not had time to\r\nread it. I might have glanced at it. But I find it best to read only\r\nwhen I can do so with some attention.\r\n\r\nPhyllotaxis: I have no notion in the world why the angular divergences\r\nshould be of that series of numbers and not of others. Opposite leaves\r\ngive (decussating) the angles. My puzzle has been to account for this\r\nsystem in cycles in leaves running into the system of decussating whorls\r\nin flowers (usually, almost universally). You will see the question by\r\ncomparing in my “Botanical Text-Book” (not “Lessons”), pp. 236, 237,\r\nwith chapter v., section 1; and you see I have drawn an illustration\r\nfrom it apropos to Falconer’s remark. But explaining the obscure by the\r\nobscure does not amount to much.\r\n\r\nAs to national affairs, how quarrelsome you English are. Here are we,\r\ncool and quietly occupied with our little affairs, never dreaming of\r\nharm from you, and your people are trying their prettiest to pick a\r\nquarrel with us, because we do what Historicus says the English have\r\nalways done and will do again when the time comes, having Lord Stowell\r\nto back them! Tell me, who is Historicus in the “Times”? An able and\r\nmost influential person evidently.\r\n\r\nThe government of England is now showing sense. Do not wonder that some\r\nwild talk is given to the air in this rough country, after what you have\r\nheard in the House of Commons, and read in the “Times,” etc. Am afraid\r\nwe shall not like each other for a good while--the nations. But all\r\nshows I was right. We must carry out our little job, and hold the United\r\nStates complete and develop material strength at any cost, or we could\r\nnot live without eating more dirt than we like.\r\n\r\nBoasting nonsense is pretty well knocked out of us by severe discipline\r\nand sad reverses, but the determination is stronger than ever.\r\n\r\nTime up and paper full. Forgive my maundering, and believe me to be,\r\n\r\nEver your affectionate,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nJune, [1863].\r\n\r\nI am kept distractingly busy, so look for nothing of any use from me yet\r\nawhile.\r\n\r\nYour Ohio case of law against marrying of cousins, I put to my\r\nneighbor, Professor Parsons, who had it looked up. He tells me there is\r\nno such law at all on the Ohio statute books, nor is there a trace of\r\nany law on the subject to be found in the laws of any State in the\r\nUnited States. He doubts if there can really be any statistics which\r\ntell on the point, because, first, the marriage of first cousins is a\r\nrare thing in this country; second, the United States decennial censuses\r\ndo not afford any information on the matter; third, nor any of the\r\n[state] censuses that he knows of.\r\n\r\nPray, don’t run mad over Phyllotaxis! I can’t save you, I am sure.\r\n\r\nGeorge’s “Converging Sines” is the same, perhaps, as what Bravais was\r\nafter. His memoir may help you (see “Botanical Text-Book,” p. 141, par.\r\n248); or, if you want something thoroughly mathematical, consult\r\nNeumann, of Berlin, in some paper, which I have no reference to....\r\n\r\nI am sorry you do not give a better account of yourself. Be careful and\r\ndo not work too hard.\r\n\r\nJuly 7.\r\n\r\nMy last from you is May 31.\r\n\r\nI had arranged to reprint most of Bates on Mimetic Analogy in\r\n“Silliman’s Journal,” but my long review of A. de Candolle crowded it\r\nout. I then thought of a brief abstract, but have had no time to prepare\r\nit. I wrote remarks and arranged long extracts of your Linum paper, and\r\ninsisted on it for the July number of “Silliman’s Journal.” But it, too,\r\nwas laid over, not for anything I had, for I have little in the July\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nI like and agree to your remark that, in Bates’s Geographical Varieties,\r\netc., we get about as near to seeing a species made as we are ever\r\nlikely to get; and so believing, I think your gradual way more likely\r\nthan Heer’s jumps.\r\n\r\nApropos to Heer, you ask me if it is not impossible to imagine so many\r\nand nice coadaptations as we see in orchids being formed all by a chance\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nI reply, Yes, perfectly impossible to imagine (and much the same by any\r\nnumber of chance blows).\r\n\r\nSo I turn the question back upon you. Is not the fact that the\r\ncoadaptations are so nice next to a demonstration against their having\r\nbeen formed by chance blows at all, one or many?\r\n\r\nHere lies, I suppose, the difference between us. When you bring me up to\r\nthis point, I feel the cold chill.\r\n\r\nI have been doing nothing but attend to my daily work, and had got so\r\nfagged that I really thought I was about to have softening of the brain,\r\nor some other breakdown. But a week of respite, caused by the death of\r\nan aged relative of my wife’s,--a dear old soul,--taking us away from\r\nhere perforce, has set me up very nearly, and now after a week more\r\ncomes my vacation, and we are off into the quiet country for three\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nA little legacy of about £2,000 to my wife comes in opportunely to\r\nrelieve us of anxiety for the future. We have no children (which I\r\nregret only that I have no son to send to the war), and this with a\r\nlittle income, rather precarious, of about £200 a year would support us\r\nin our very simple way, if I were to throw up my place here. But I\r\ncannot do that yet....\r\n\r\nLook at Impatiens flowers; see if the most fertile “precociously\r\nfertilized” ones ever get crossed!\r\n\r\nI have asked in three directions for seeds of the Specularia perfoliata.\r\nInclosed are depauperate specimens.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty to see honey-bees cross-fertilize Locust (Robinia), much as\r\nyou say of broom. One of my students has been noticing the way bees act\r\non Kalmia.\r\n\r\nNow for my best thing for to-day.\r\n\r\nAn orchid which I missed last year, Platanthera flava, I knew would be\r\ncurious, for I remembered a strong protuberance on base of labellum, on\r\nthe median line. I have not time left to describe it now, having been\r\nsadly interrupted, but it is pretty,--equal to anything you have yet\r\nseen in British orchids. The process turns proboscis of insect either to\r\nright or left, where it will slip into an imperfect ring (as seen from\r\nabove) or deep groove (as seen from before), in which lies the disk, not\r\nflat but coiled up, ready to catch proboscis. It is like the eye of a\r\nneedle to receive the thread.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I will send you, or print, a sketch[56] of the thing.\r\n\r\nI am waiting for Gymnadenia tridentata to come on.\r\n\r\nBut the post hour has come.\r\n\r\nJuly 21.\r\n\r\nYour latest is of the 26th ult. You need not worry! It never wearies nor\r\nbores me to write to you, in the off-hand way I do. I enjoy our\r\ncorrespondence too much to consent to curtail or interrupt it. I learn\r\nfrom you, here in this remote part of the world, a thousand things which\r\nI should not otherwise know at all. And you stimulate my mind far more\r\nthan any one else, except, perhaps, Hooker. So please do not make a\r\nfuss, but let me go on in my own fashion, and send me your fresh and\r\nstimulating letters, whenever you are in the mood of it. I am now in my\r\nvacation, and already, having idled and dawdled a week or two, I am as\r\nwell and hearty as possible, and in the best of spirits. We should leave\r\nhome this week for three weeks’ run in the country, but the sickness of\r\nmy wife’s nephew, Lieutenant Jackson of Massachusetts Cavalry, will keep\r\nus awhile, as, though not alarming, it might take a bad turn, and so I\r\nmay not be in the country for a week or two yet. We shall see....\r\n\r\nI have strong and fresh Drosera rotundifolia, and it will now turn in\r\nits bristles and stick the viscid gland fast to a fly, binding him fast\r\non all sides with liliputian cords. But it is awfully slow about\r\nit,--say three or four hours, and the next day the leaf sometimes\r\nbecomes involute and folds over or curves around the insect; but what\r\ngood? If the fly is not stuck fast in alighting, no movement takes place\r\nto hold him till he has got away if he ever could. However, it is an\r\nindication of what is so effectually done in Dionæa.\r\n\r\nRotary movement of end of tendril-bearing stems is common, is it not,\r\nand well-known?\r\n\r\nAny notes you will give me to print in “Silliman’s Journal,” I shall\r\nalways delight in.\r\n\r\nI have been reading Owen’s Aye-aye paper. Well, this is rich and cool!\r\nDid I not tell you in the “Atlantic,” long ago, that Owen had a\r\ntransmutation theory of his own! It is your Hamlet, with the part of\r\nHamlet left out! But as you say now, you don’t so much insist on natural\r\nselection, if you can only have derivation of species. And Owen goes in\r\nfor derivation on the largest scale. You may as well lovingly embrace!\r\nOh, it is rare fun!...\r\n\r\nI have been so far disappointed in getting no Gymnadenia tridentata. But\r\nI still hope for it. I must have it, indeed.\r\n\r\nBoott’s address is good, chiefly very good. But he speaks of Wyman’s\r\npaper without having duly considered it. Wyman’s experiments are better\r\nthan Pasteur’s, and the results opposite!\r\n\r\nP. S.--Papers just in, or rather telegrams, that you in London were\r\ndaily awaiting and expecting the capture of Washington, etc., and\r\nspeculating as to whether Jeff Davis’s envoys from Washington might not\r\nbe received at London as a fait accompli. A good deal of\r\nlittle-concealed joy, etc.\r\n\r\nOh, foolish people! When will you see that there is only one end to all\r\nthis, and that the North never dreams of any other,--the complete\r\nputting down of the rebellion. And since 1863 began, it was clear that\r\nit would be attended with the annihilation of slavery.\r\n\r\nTime was when we should have highly valued English appreciation of the\r\nright cause. We have long ceased to care or think about it.\r\n\r\nWe only wish you had the city of New York. But the sympathizers with\r\nsecession and riot there have done their worst, and lost their game. The\r\ncity of New York is the only part of our country which I am ashamed of;\r\nand the trouble there is that it is not American.\r\n\r\nEnough; good-bye.\r\nA. G.\r\n\r\nSeptember 1.\r\n\r\nYour fine, long letter of August 4th reached me up in the country, in my\r\nnative region, in the centre of the State of New York, rusticating and\r\nenjoying ourselves mightily. We were among the people of a thriving\r\nregion; a well-to-do set; no poverty near us for miles and miles, i.\r\ne., no hardship, except any that a drunken laborer might bring on his\r\nfamily; and I longed to take you out with us in our drives, that you\r\nmight see a happy and comfortable country, more and more so every year,\r\nand perhaps a larger ratio of the population refined to a reasonable\r\ndegree in feeling and life than I know of in any other part of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI will consider about fantastic variation of pigeons. I see afar trouble\r\nenough ahead quoad design in nature, but have managed to keep off the\r\nchilliness by giving the knotty questions a rather wide berth. If I\r\nrather avoid, I cannot ignore the difficulties ahead. But if I adopt\r\nyour view bodily, can you promise me any less difficulties?\r\n\r\nIf your Lythrum paper shall be at all equal in interest to that on\r\nLinum, it will be a gem.\r\n\r\nAs to tendrils, what are Hooker and Oliver (the latter a professor, too)\r\nabout, and where have they lived not to know anything of them? Everybody\r\nmust have seen, in Cucurbitaceæ and Passiflora, tendrils reaching out\r\nstraight for a certain time, and then, if they reach nothing, coiling up\r\nfrom the end. Also the sweeping of stems....\r\n\r\nP. S. [To the above?] Three numbers of Boston newspapers recently sent\r\nyou, two by this mail (in which my good beau-père is again “spiking the\r\nEnglish”), please to forward to Reuben Harvey, Esq., Limerick, Ireland.\r\n\r\nYou are quite out in supposing that hatred of England is increasing, or\r\nthat there is the least desire to meddle with you, except in\r\nself-defense.\r\n\r\nMy own feelings were very sensitive at first, because I expected better\r\nthings, and I then deferred much to British opinion. I now do neither,\r\nand nothing strikes me more than the smallness of mind and largeness of\r\ngullibility of the British people, as far as I can judge from their\r\npress (weeklies, quarterlies, and “Times”). But I do not suppose you\r\nwill fight us because you dislike us; and so conversely. I suppose I do\r\nnot see the papers which so abuse England, though I read influential and\r\nrespectable papers; but from what I do see, I think we receive far more\r\nabuse and misrepresentation and unfair usage than we give.\r\n\r\nAs to the course of the war and policy of our country as to slavery,\r\nsome day when you turn back to some early letter of mine you will see\r\nthat I was a fairly good prophet; that the South might have delayed the\r\nabolition of slavery by giving up early in the conflict, but that every\r\nmonth of continued resistance hastened and insured the downfall of\r\nslavery. That is now doomed, and sure near to rapid death; quick in some\r\nplaces, slower in others, but sure.\r\n\r\nIll-usage of negroes--who make such good soldiers--will soon be unheard\r\nof, except with Irish. It will take some generations of American life to\r\nbreed out the barbarian they bring to the country.\r\n\r\nNovember 23.\r\n\r\nThe next best thing, of late, is the exposé of Lindsay and George\r\nSaunders (the Confederates) by Historicus.\r\n\r\nI trust Historicus’ previous letters, in which he shows (about the same\r\ntime my father-in-law’s articles on the subject reached England) that it\r\nis the duty of a country to see that armed or war vessels are not fitted\r\nout, quite irrespective of all municipal law, have produced their proper\r\neffect. Something has produced a great effect, and a great change in the\r\nidea of what it was incumbent on the government to do; and nothing can\r\nbe more satisfactory than the views now taken; and the effect here is\r\nexcellent. For we are sure that when the right notions once get a\r\nlodgment, as they have, England will faithfully carry them through.\r\nLawyers whom I knew here were confident how the law would ultimately be\r\nlaid down by your courts; but we greatly feared it would be done only\r\nafter a few more such vessels had got to sea. All will go well now.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper I occasionally send you is a fair specimen of the\r\ninfluential part of the press here. Such articles as the “Times” likes\r\nto cite have far less effect here than you suppose in the determination\r\nof events.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 11, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ENGELMANN,--Our good old friend Von Martius writes me that on\r\nthe 30th March next, he will reach his fiftieth anniversary of his\r\ndoctorate. I dare say his friends will commemorate it in Germany. It\r\noccurs to me that it would be a good idea for some of us, his friends\r\nand correspondents, to compliment him upon the occasion. Suppose you\r\ndraw up in German a letter of congratulation, etc., to be signed by\r\nyourself, Torrey, Sullivant, etc., and forward about the proper time.\r\nSend me, with your German circular letter to Martius, a translation in\r\nEnglish....\r\n\r\nYes, I will let you work at botany when I guard you.[57] Your botanical\r\nwork is far better than your politics. But you must swear the\r\nPresident’s oath, Proclamation and all!!\r\n\r\nMartius is not a very remarkable botanist, but good; is a genial,\r\nphilosophical soul (full of Plato, etc.), a good explorer, has worked up\r\nthe Palms, etc., well, and is a wonderful man for the amount he knows on\r\na vast number of different subjects,--philology, antiquities,\r\nphilosophy, et id genus omne.\r\n\r\nMay 3, [1864].\r\n\r\n... Spring is opening here, but late. From this to July 10, I am engaged\r\nin college every day in the week. Also am watching the herbarium\r\nbuilding go up, the brick walls of which, if good weather, may be all up\r\nthis week, and the roof put on next week.\r\n\r\nYour circular letter to good Martius was very good, especially in its\r\noriginal German. Thanks....\r\n\r\nNever mind if “Sagittaria graminea, Michaux,” is applicable to only one\r\nform. You had best keep the old name, the more so as that you propose,\r\nS. simplicifolia, is “not always correct.” We can’t let you change a\r\nname because you can improve it. Too many can and would play at that\r\ngame, and less discreetly than you would, and then cite your example!\r\n\r\nIf Fendler gets tired of bush-clearing, and will come to me this fall, I\r\nwill give him $500 a year as curator, lodgings, two rooms in gardener’s\r\nhouse, which I have reserved; and let him have say three days in the\r\nweek for himself, if he wants them.\r\n\r\nThe people are determined to support and reëlect their excellent\r\nPresident Lincoln (what a noble letter that last of his), whether\r\nFrémont and the like make a coalition with copperheads or not. It is all\r\nthe same to us. Lincoln will walk the course. God bless him!\r\n\r\nWright is coming home for a few months this summer.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, September 18, 1863.\r\n\r\nWhat Don José affirms about coast and mountain vegetation being much the\r\nsame is curious, unlikely, yet you seem to find it so. That bit of coast\r\nwith all microphyllous and spiny vegetation is also curious.\r\n\r\nI am glad you like him for being an abolitionist. Though not very much\r\nof an abolitionist myself, at the start, I hope I can fall in with, and\r\nwelcome, the ways of Providence, when Providence takes the matter in\r\nhand, and say Amen....\r\n\r\nWell, you are doing well in botanizing, and should finish up Cuban\r\nbotany while you are at it. And on your return, you and Grisebach should\r\njoin teams, and do up Cuban botany in a full memoir. You are right to\r\nstay till next spring. You are happy in Cuba; you would not be so here.\r\nThings in the United States do not go to suit you at all. “Things is\r\nworking,” and in the right way,--but the end must be the total\r\nsuppression of the rebellion,--the exile or punishment of rebel leaders,\r\nthe return of the masses to their duty, and they will put things\r\nstraight. Just what is now going on in Tennessee will go on elsewhere, I\r\nsuppose. I know only one man in Cambridge that you could talk secesh to.\r\nWe can correspond very well, and keep cool. But if we were together,\r\nduring the war, we should get into a row at once. It could not be\r\notherwise....\r\n\r\nWhen the Union is restored (which it is to be, of course, when the\r\nrebellion is put down) those who do not love us well enough to resume\r\ntheir duties and privileges have only to take themselves off to some\r\ncountry they like better. The United States of America belongs to loyal\r\nAmericans. After the war the country will prosper wonderfully. And the\r\nSouth will get to be something.\r\n\r\nDecember 1.\r\n\r\nThings move on.\r\n\r\n“The mills of the Gods grind slow, but they grind exceeding fine.” Wait\r\nin Cuba a year longer, and you may return to a country in which slavery,\r\nhaving tried to get more, has lost all, and as a system is defunct, to\r\nthe lasting benefit of all parties.\r\n\r\nYou might now revisit your old Texan haunts, under General Banks’s\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe November elections show a united North. Peace democracy has made its\r\nissue, and is dead. The reëlection of Lincoln by acclamation seems\r\nprobable, supported by moderate men of all sorts, the extremes of the\r\nopposing parties alone going against him....\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas to you.\r\n\r\nJanuary 21, 1864.\r\n\r\nBy the steamer of Saturday, which takes this, a good young fellow, Mr.\r\nKennedy, a member of our Senior class, goes to Cuba, to look after\r\nbusiness of his father, and, when he can, to botanize, only four or five\r\nweeks, that is, in vacation. He is very fond of botany, and bids fair to\r\nbe a botanist some day, if he does not take to money-making instead....\r\n\r\nThis war, we think, will be pretty much over next summer; and then, back\r\nin the Union, with slavery pretty much nowhere, by the hearty wish of a\r\nmajority of the people, we may expect a career of prosperity and real\r\nadvance of the South, such as it has never known. At least we hope so.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 25, 1863.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, your letter found us here just on the eve of our month’s\r\nholiday, a trip to Lake George, and thence to my natal region, in the\r\nmost beautiful (and the most English-looking) part of the State of New\r\nYork.... My wife was well enough to do her small part in a great fair\r\nheld in Boston for the United States Sanitary Commission (which has kept\r\nthe ladies very busy for the last six months), which has just closed,\r\nhaving brought the net proceeds of about $125,000 (it turns out\r\n$140,000) for the relief of suffering.\r\n\r\nAs to our national affairs, I should like now and then to send you such\r\ncomments or articles as seem to me to throw most light upon our\r\ncondition. There is little I could say in a letter. I said very early to\r\nEnglish friends that if the rebellion were short it might leave things\r\nmuch as they were before (no desirable state), but if long and\r\nobstinate, it would cut the knot we were unable to untie and completely\r\ndestroy the slave system. You see now it is coming to pass, by rather\r\nslow but sure steps, and a great blessing it is to be to the South. To\r\nthe North the war, with all its sad evils, has been a great good,\r\nmorally and politically. The end is in the hands of Providence, and we\r\nhumbly wait for it; but there is very little diversity of opinion here\r\nas to what, essentially, the end is to be, that is, the complete\r\nterritorial reinstatement of the Union, and the abolition of slavery.\r\nVery sanguine, you think, in England. We must wait and see, and on our\r\npart hope and labor.\r\n\r\nNow for a little personal matter. I have long been anxious for the\r\nsafety and final destination of my herbarium and other botanical\r\ncollections, which in my house (besides that, there is not room for\r\nthem) are too liable to destruction from fire. I had offered them, with\r\nmy botanical library, to our university, if they would build in the\r\nBotanic Garden a fireproof building to hold them, and raise a small fund\r\nfor their support. Recently and quite unexpectedly, a banker in Boston,\r\nalmost unknown to me personally, has offered in any case to construct\r\nthe building, and a few friends are taking steps, with good prospects,\r\nto raise by gifts a fund of $10,000 for the support of the\r\nestablishment. When done, I shall feel that my collections, which are\r\nmost important for North American botany, are secure for the use of\r\nfuture botanists. To secure this I gladly divest myself of the ownership\r\nof collections which have absorbed most of my small spare means for the\r\nlast thirty years, and which are valued at $20,000 or more....\r\n\r\nIn the council of our American Academy (of which since May last I have\r\nbeen president) we have nominated Dean Milman to the foreign honorary\r\nmembership vacated by the death of Whately, and Max Müller to that\r\nvacated by Grimm. The election has not yet taken place.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gray, with kind regards, joins me in best wishes for the new year\r\nto you and yours.\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 22, 1863.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--I thank you cordially for your letter of the 13th\r\nNovember, and for the copy of Thury’s interesting and curious paper.\r\nThis I had not seen, neither Pictet’s notice. I find it very\r\ninteresting, but I do not see how he got a legitimate deduction from the\r\nfacts given by Knight in the vegetable kingdom to his principle in the\r\nanimal kingdom. However, that is of small moment if the principle holds.\r\nThe subject is one which will naturally attract much attention, and\r\nwhich, as you remark, has philosophical bearings. I mean to bring it up,\r\nnext week, for discussion at our private (social) scientific club in\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nI thank you also for the good spirit in which you take, as I meant them,\r\nmy criticisms upon your article on Species, etc. There is no progress to\r\nbe made upon such interesting subjects without free criticism, because\r\nwithout it we cannot perfectly clear up our own views nor impart them\r\nperfectly to others. And especially, since I have so often to criticise\r\nthe views or writings of persons for whom I have no particular regard,\r\nit is pleasant, if only for the sake of impartiality, to criticise those\r\nfor whom you have the greatest regard and respect. So I particularly\r\nlike it when I can criticise such a near friend as J. D. Hooker or\r\nBentham, and I believe they like it, too, at least Hooker, who is\r\nhimself a very free critic. Of course, I know very well that you will be\r\nlikely to turn all the points I made. The question upon which of the two\r\nfoundations the idea of species rests, I well know is not to be settled\r\noff-hand by any bit of argument. Pray take up the cudgels against me\r\nwhenever an occasion offers.\r\n\r\nAs to theoretical views, you and I receive and use them as means, not as\r\nends, and expect to change many of them from time to time. Such\r\nespecially as relate to origins and causes are the questions which we\r\nask, rather than answers that we receive; and we put our questions\r\nvariously according to the leadings of the case at the time. But this is\r\nall commonplace and trite.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to see that Owen, in his Aye-aye paper, has come to adopt\r\nHeer’s[58] views essentially, of course without the slightest allusion\r\nto Heer.\r\n\r\nOur civil war goes on slowly, but very surely, toward the destruction of\r\nnegro slavery; and with all its great cost, we may hope for future\r\nbenefit in proportion. By the time we have nearly ended our war, it may\r\nbe that Europe will have its turn again. I hope not.\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO JAMES D. DANA.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 20, [1864].\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DANA,--Perhaps you may not know, and I hope you may be as\r\npleased as I was to know, that your article of last summer on Geological\r\nPeriods is reprinted in full in the “Reader” (of London), with an\r\nappreciative prefix.\r\n\r\nCephalization goes on bravely in your very taking article which you have\r\njust sent me. I am much struck with it.\r\n\r\nIn one thing you zoölogists miss it, I think,--in following French\r\ncustoms in dropping the Latin, the vernacular of science, in names. I\r\nwish you would write Aphaniptera, etc., which is just as much English\r\nafter all as Aphanipters, and good for all languages.\r\n\r\nHave Englishified contractions for all such names if you will; it is\r\nwell. But in proposing and formally writing of such divisions, etc.,\r\npray use the scientific form.\r\n\r\nThe other course has greatly jargonified zoölogy.\r\n\r\nIn botany we have always been more dignified. Moreover I detest “larve,”\r\nthough Kirby tried to introduce the word. “Larva” has got to be as\r\nEnglish as “phenomenon.”\r\n\r\nBut I dare say most would agree with you.\r\n\r\nI like the ring of most of the new technical terms you have coined....\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nFebruary 16, 1864.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--Here we are past midwinter, and not being stimulated as\r\nof old by your exciting letters, I have not written you a line since\r\nChristmas. Not that I have had anything in particular to tell you. I\r\nwrite now to say how very sorry I am that the word or two I get about\r\nyou from Hooker gives me the idea that you are having an uncomfortable\r\nand suffering time, as well as entirely broken off from scientific work.\r\nI feel very sorry about it, and do long for better news of you....\r\n\r\nI have lately printed a couple of monographs, one pretty big one, of\r\nAmerican Astragali. I do not know that they contain anything you would\r\ncare to see. Yet I think I shall send you a copy presently, through\r\nHooker.\r\n\r\nI feel much the loss of dear old Boott, so good, so true a friend, and\r\nhe was always writing me little notes telling me of all that was going\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of our country, you must see, at least I assure you, has\r\nsettled, as I knew it would if the rebellion was obstinate enough, into\r\na determination to do away with slavery. Homely, honest, ungainly\r\nLincoln is the representative man of the country.\r\n\r\nA Boston gentleman, at cost of $11,000 or more, is to build a fireproof\r\nhouse for my herbarium, which I give to the university, with my\r\nbotanical library. A fund of $12,000 is raising to support it, which\r\nwill relieve me of the expenditure of about $500 a year. But I shall\r\nhave double care and bother all the coming spring and summer.\r\n\r\nDr. Scudder has gone to Cuba, to attend an invalid, and wishes to\r\nexamine orchid fertilization, and asks me what in particular he should\r\nlook at.\r\n\r\nPray get well, dear Darwin, and believe me to be ever,\r\n\r\nYours cordially,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 4, 1864.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. CHURCH,--If you have long ago written your American\r\ncorrespondent off your books, as being a right shabby fellow, he could\r\nnot complain.\r\n\r\nHere is your agreeable letter of January 19th, a most prompt and more\r\nthan kind response to mine of Christmas, still unacknowledged by me!\r\n\r\nThe fact simply is that I have been delaying week by week in the hope of\r\nbeing able to announce to you that the subscription for the support of\r\nour botanical establishment was filled up. I am sorry to say that this\r\ncannot yet be said. The matter has been privately conducted, that is,\r\nnothing said about it in the public prints; but the two gentlemen who\r\ntook the matter in hand have quietly circulated the paper among their\r\nwell-to-do acquaintances in Boston, not beginning till late in January,\r\nunder the idea that the fair for the Sanitary Commission had perhaps\r\nexhausted their friends’ purses. Since then, far greater and more\r\npressing demands have been made upon the benevolent and the\r\npublic-spirited, for a variety of good objects; and our affair has gone\r\nslowly in consequence.\r\n\r\nI have not heard for a week respecting it, but a week ago the sum\r\nsubscribed was a little less than seven thousand dollars, the greater\r\npart in sums of $500 each. The $10,000 is obviously secure, for\r\nsubscribers of $100 each, yet to be appealed to, may be relied on for a\r\ngood part of the lacking sum. But it begins to be clearly seen that\r\n$12,000 are needed for the capital of the fund, and this, at the present\r\nrate, it will take some time to secure.\r\n\r\nYour own offer of a small subscription, I can truly say, not only\r\ngratified me in the highest degree, as an expression of an interest in\r\nour affair which I had no reason to expect, but has already been of\r\nuse,--has really been as good for us as any contribution you ought to\r\nmake. For I took the liberty to read that portion of your letter to\r\nthree or four friends, and their interest in the matter was sensibly\r\nquickened and exalted by this evidence of the lively interest in the\r\nmatter taken by a country parson, far away in England! So pray consider\r\nthat you have already helped us on, and we are truly grateful to you for\r\nyour generous proffer. There is, indeed, a strong temptation to accept\r\nyour kind offer in the fact that, in the present state of exchanges,\r\nowing to our paper currency not on a specie basis (one of the sad\r\nconsequences of our civil war), every pound sterling in England, in\r\nnormal times worth only from $4.90 to $5.00, is worth nearly or quite\r\n$8.00, so that a contribution of £5 sterling really now counts here for\r\nabout forty dollars!! So you see how hard it is for me to discourage\r\nyour kind intentions. But I really feel that the sum which I specified,\r\nas the condition of my own gift to our university, is really quite sure,\r\nthough slower in coming than we had hoped.\r\n\r\nAs to the building for the herbarium, I have only to state it goes on\r\nfamously. It is considerably enlarged in plan from what was at first\r\ncontemplated, and a favorable early spring has allowed of more progress\r\nthan could have been expected at this season.\r\n\r\nThe generous donor of the building not only adopted at once the larger\r\nplans as soon as suggested, but himself proposed improvements and\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\nThe building, the foundations of which are already laid, in the most\r\nsubstantial manner, is 32 by 57 feet, and is connected with my private\r\nstudy in the house I reside in by a neat conservatory 18 feet long,\r\nwhich takes the place of the simple wooden corridor at first intended.\r\nThe whole will cost Mr. Thayer, the donor, by the contracts, more than\r\n$11,000, and is likely, by extras, to reach the round sum of $12,000.\r\nAnd all will be done before the summer is over, we trust.\r\n\r\nSee how the expression of your interest to me has led me on, to the\r\nneglect of everything else I want to write about.... I wish to say\r\nsomething about the troubles in your Old World, which, with all its age\r\nand wisdom, falls into “difficulties” hardly less grave than ours. I\r\nhope poor brave Denmark will not be crushed out of existence. There are\r\nEnglish questions which we regard with much attention, ecclesiastical\r\nand social questions, on which I would fain know what you think. But I\r\ncannot write longer now.\r\n\r\nOnly as to our war, I beg you to believe that we (the earnest thoughtful\r\npeople and most around us, according to their measure) have acted and\r\nare acting from the highest sense of duty,--duty to our beloved country\r\nand to humanity; and we keep the full conviction that great and\r\npermanent good is to result. Much of the good we see already, and more\r\ncomes near to realization every day. So we work and trust, and suffer\r\ncheerfully. We only wish our views and motives were better appreciated\r\nin general in the country and by the people whose good opinion we most\r\nvalue. But even the lack of that appreciation, which is far from\r\nuniversal, is likely to do us good. I am always sure of your thoughtful\r\ngood wishes for us. But I must break off.\r\n\r\nEver yours most sincerely,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, May 30, 1864.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--I have let your very kind letter of 28th January\r\nlie on my desk a long time, always expecting to write soon, but, having\r\nbeen extremely busy with various administrative matters and college work\r\nsince it reached me, the convenient moment for writing to you has not\r\narrived till now. I inclose a note to my young friend and late\r\ncolleague, Professor Eliot, which I beg you to send to the poste\r\nrestante on arrival. I learn from his friends here that he may be\r\nexpected to be in Geneva about the time this reaches you.\r\n\r\nIn my note I ask him to call upon you, as a friend of mine. He will of\r\ncourse be unwilling to make any demands upon your time or attention.\r\nBut I should like him to see you, and perhaps he might through you pay\r\nhis respects to the _savans_ in his line, notably to De la Rive. Having\r\nwife, etc., with him, and little time, his visit will be transient.\r\nEliot is a chemist and physicist, a man of much promise, we think, and a\r\nmost gentlemanly man. He is a very trusty friend of mine. He has passed\r\nthe autumn and winter in Paris, studying hard, and will soon return\r\nhere, bringing the latest news of you. He and his lady companions are\r\njust such people as we should like you to know America by.\r\n\r\nI should say to you, moreover, that I gave to another colleague of mine,\r\nProfessor Cooke, a note to you. He is a chemist and mineralogist, is\r\nfull of research and zeal, a most estimable man.\r\n\r\nYou know, perhaps, that I have made over (or am to make over) all my\r\nherbarium and library to our university, in consideration of a fireproof\r\nbuilding made to receive them, and a fund, of moderate extent, raised\r\nfor the permanent support.... During the summer or early autumn, my\r\ncollections will be transferred to this their permanent home, to my\r\ngreat relief.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that I shall continue to spend upon these collections all\r\nmy available means, and I hope they will be of use in the future, as\r\nwell as safe, which they are not in my wooden house. My own donation is\r\nreckoned in money value at about $20,000.\r\n\r\nCharles Wright is expected home from Cuba soon, when there will be a new\r\nand interesting distribution of his phænogamous plants.\r\n\r\nWe trust that our civil war is in its last year, that is, if we are\r\nvictorious, as we hope to be. In that case your American stocks will be\r\nall right again. Nearly all the little I possess is cheerfully put into\r\nUnited States government stocks, where I am well content it should be.\r\n\r\nSmall countries, which you prefer, would do very well if all were small,\r\nbut the few large, like England and France, will domineer unpleasantly\r\nover the smaller. Just look now at poor Denmark, which has the\r\nmisfortune to be small, and so is made to suffer! All Scandinavia had\r\nbest combine, and build up a strong nation. Natural selection is hard\r\nupon the weak! However it may be in Europe, you must excuse us for\r\nendeavoring to prevent, while we may, even at great cost, the\r\nestablishment of a European system on this side of the Atlantic; so we\r\nmust not fail to put down the Confederacy. We shall, after that, in a\r\nquiet way, make the French emperor very uncomfortable in Mexico; but we\r\nhope that country may yet be a strong power, but not a French power.\r\n\r\nEnough of politics! And believe me to be, with affectionate regard,\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 30, 1865.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE: ... This very day, I have received your envoi by\r\npost of the neat little article on leaves of Fagus, which I had seen in\r\nEnglish dress, and the copy of Heer’s address. Many thanks to you. I\r\nhave received also, and thank you much for it, the “Prodromus,” XIV., I.\r\nI have this evening read over Heer’s address. It is, as you say,\r\ncapital. It interests me in its proof of the antiquity of the present\r\nflora; and I admit that he very neatly puts the case between his view of\r\nthe production of our species out of the older ones, and that of Darwin.\r\nHere it still rests: Darwin has the great advantage of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. ASA GRAY IN HIS STUDY]\r\n\r\nbeing able to assign a vera causa. Heer has the disadvantage of having\r\nno known cause to assign; but he shows that things do not appear to have\r\nproceeded as Darwin’s theory requires. It does seem as if there were\r\ntimes of peculiar change as well as of great stability. But were this\r\ntime of change and that of stability simultaneous for the species of a\r\nflora? And does Heer allow enough for the species which now occur under\r\nmany forms,--show great polymorphism. I continually meet with these in\r\nthe North American flora; in which the dying out of some forms, and\r\ntheir replacing by others, which may well take place in time, would, in\r\neffect, just give a change like that to be accounted for. But I cannot\r\nsay that these varieties come in insensibly, very likely not.\r\n\r\nNow, to speak of myself. My summer was much frittered away; the\r\nsuperintending of the new building for my herbarium just preventing any\r\nserious study. The autumn was devoted to the removal and rearrangement\r\nof plants and books, and to assisting Charles Wright in the collation\r\nand distribution into sets of his collections in Cuba for the last three\r\nyears past; very full and interesting collections, and requiring much\r\ncare and labor, on account of this distribution being a continuation of\r\nformer distributions. I laid out into the sets every specimen with my\r\nown hands, Mr. Wright adding the tickets and numbers. It was an immense\r\nlabor, and was finished only at the close of the last day of the\r\nyear....\r\n\r\nI mean to prepare for “Silliman’s Journal” a brief and simple notice of\r\nthe edifice for my herbarium, so I will not speak further of it here;\r\nfurther than to say that I am well satisfied, only I sadly need a\r\ncurator!\r\n\r\nAnd now, I turn to your letter of September 29, and ask your pardon for\r\nhaving so long neglected it. Your letters, your reflections upon social\r\nand political, as well as upon scientific questions, are always very\r\ninteresting and instructive to me. I regret that I can render so little\r\nreturn in kind....\r\n\r\nAs to our national troubles, the prospect brightens that we shall end\r\nthe rebellion and slavery before long. God grant it.\r\n\r\nBelieve me to be, as ever, my dear De Candolle, very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nFebruary 14, 1865.\r\n\r\n... Wright is here, distributing and finishing up his North Pacific\r\nExpedition Collection; ... will return to Cuba in a month or two, to\r\ntake a year or two more there, revisit some old parts and explore some\r\nnew; then I urge Hayti, but Wright seems rather loth.\r\n\r\nRothrock--from northwestern Pennsylvania--is a bright lively pupil of\r\nmine for last three or four years, when not serving his country in the\r\narmy, where he has done good service as private in infantry, and as\r\ncaptain in Pennsylvania cavalry, etc. He had to leave his thesis partly\r\nunfinished. But the real credit of all belongs to him. His father is M.\r\nD., and he is now studying medicine, attending lectures at Philadelphia.\r\nBut botany is in him, and will probably come out....\r\n\r\nThere, I believe this is about all. J. A. Lowell has made a nice present\r\nof costly botanical books, of which more anon.\r\n\r\n[March 18.]\r\n\r\n... Rothrock is going with Kinnicut this week, to Northwestern America,\r\nNorton’s Sound, etc., to explore on telegraph route close along the\r\nArctic Circle. Any pines there you want?...\r\n\r\nMarch 29.\r\n\r\n... No, Mrs. Gray did not go to inauguration ball. But she has had a\r\ngood time. Her brother, the general, took her from Fortress Monroe,\r\nwhere she went, up to the front and close to rebel lines; where she had\r\nthe honor of having a rebel shell thrown at her!\r\n\r\nI expect her home again to-morrow.\r\n\r\nNo, I don’t get a curator, and I want one sadly. Yet it is as well\r\nFendler did not come, as it might have been difficult for me to pay him.\r\nHe, however, is just the man I want here, to take charge of herbarium\r\nand garden....\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 24, 1865.\r\n\r\nMr. Wright is about to return to Cuba, to have one year more of\r\nexploration there, and especially to visit Turquino, the highest\r\nmountain of the island, and some other parts which are still promising.\r\n\r\nHe will now be able--as he is always most ready--to attend to the\r\ngathering of seeds of palms, or other seeds, or things you may want at\r\nKew. He has now some good and kind friends in the country, and deserves\r\nthem, for he is one of the most hearty, single-minded, and disinterested\r\npersons I ever knew, as well as an admirable collector; but being rather\r\nrough in exterior, he does not like to come into contact with official\r\npeople, unless properly accredited. But if armed with official\r\ninstructions to British consuls, etc., and so having the means of very\r\npromptly turning over, without bother or uncertainty, whatever he may\r\ncollect for you, I have no doubt you may turn him to excellent account.\r\nPerhaps, however, he will not long remain in Cuba; for there is a\r\nprospect of getting him attached (nominally, without any emolument) to\r\nthe United States consulate-general at Hayti, so that he may explore the\r\nbotany of that island, as he has done that of Cuba. But I doubt if he\r\nwill keep in the field many years more, or do such hard work as he has\r\ndone in former years. I wish him to explore Hayti, however, and then\r\nassociate himself with Grisebach in the production of a Flora Antillana,\r\nor at least a Flora Cubensis, if Grisebach inclines to work longer at\r\nWest Indian botany, after having finished the critical enumeration of\r\nCuban plants (founded mainly on Wright’s collections) which he is now\r\noccupied with....\r\n\r\nIt seems like old times to be writing to you. We have the less occasion\r\nfor direct correspondence of late years, owing to my having such a\r\ncapital correspondent, as well as a capital friend, in Joseph. I know\r\nnot how I could get on without him. I look with great satisfaction upon\r\nhis splendid scientific career, and feel that you must take great pride\r\nin it. I rejoice to hear that you are so well and hearty, and at work\r\nwith vigor, comfort, and success upon the “Synopsis Filicum.”\r\n\r\nDr. Brewer[59] sends his regards. He goes this week to New Haven (Yale\r\nCollege), to attend to the opening of his work as professor of\r\nagriculture. I was running over his collections, naming and\r\ncharacterizing the new things, and laying out a set for you of all you\r\ncould wish. But since spring opened, my college work has been so\r\npressing that all else has been interrupted, perhaps will be in abeyance\r\ntill near midsummer.\r\n\r\nI must not fail to tell you that our good friend Dr. Torrey sailed\r\nyesterday for California! via the Isthmus, to return three or four\r\nmonths hence, perhaps overland.\r\n\r\nHe is a much trusted officer of government, as assayer of the United\r\nStates assay office at New York, and the secretary of the treasury,\r\nknowing that he needs some respite and change, has arranged this trip\r\nfor him, upon business of the department, by no means of an onerous\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nHe has long wished to set eyes upon California, and I am glad he has\r\nsuch a pleasant opportunity of doing so.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nMay 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nI have long wished to communicate with you, but it is long since I have\r\nwritten any but pressing letters; a large and ever-increasing scientific\r\ncorrespondence and various business matters absorbing all my leisure and\r\npowers, as the times and events also absorb our thoughts. You can\r\nimagine how deeply we have felt, rejoiced, and suffered during the last\r\nmonth or so.\r\n\r\nWell, “treason has done its worst,” and rebellion, as an organized\r\npower, is essentially brought to an end. Slavery is done away, and we\r\nhave now the task of establishing a new and better order of things at\r\nthe South, of replacing barbarous by civilized and free institutions. A\r\nheavy task, no doubt; but the good Providence that has so wonderfully\r\nshaped our ways and sustained us thus far, we humbly and confidently\r\nrely on to carry our dear country through all its trials.\r\n\r\nI doubt if you will have in England a full conception of the profound\r\nimpression which this last atrocious crime has made,[60] filling the\r\nwhole land with the deepest and tenderest grief, like that of a personal\r\nbereavement; inexpressibly shocking, but never for a moment bewildering\r\nthe country nor deranging the action of the government. The manner in\r\nwhich both our victories and sorrows have affected the country is most\r\nhopeful, and promises the best results. There is much yet to do and to\r\nsuffer, and there is need of wisdom, patience, and sacrifice in the\r\nrenovation of our country, and the establishment of free institutions\r\nthroughout the South, involving as it does the complete reconstruction\r\nof society there. But under God’s blessing, we expect full success in\r\ndue time.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, I can say little now. I am quite overworked at this\r\nseason, but I hope that hereafter a rearrangement of my work in the\r\nuniversity may bring some relief.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to enjoy the advantage and comfort of the establishment\r\nof my herbarium, and the building quite meets my expectations. The\r\ncollections are fast increasing; faster than I can take care of them,\r\nthrough the bounty of my scientific correspondents; while Mr. Lowell’s\r\ndonation of botanical books is of the value of about £300.\r\n\r\nNovember 16, 1865.\r\n\r\nNow do not be startled at a letter from me written the very evening of\r\nthe day in which arrived your pleasant favor of the 1st inst. For to-day\r\nI also received the inclosed official letter, which has been lying, I\r\nsuppose, for want of your address. And so I send it forward at once.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the fund raised for the support of the herbarium (nearly\r\n$11,000) has been till very lately retained in the hands of the\r\ngentleman who took charge of raising it, in the form of a good\r\ninvestment, and is now at length made over to the corporation of the\r\nuniversity in trust. Your £5 I turned in at the time when exchange was\r\nat the highest (i. e., our currency most depreciated), so it figures as\r\nfifty dollars,--quite a sum,--and for it, as for the rest of the\r\ncapital, we get, up to 1881, six per cent per annum in gold, if the\r\nUnited States government lasts. And we now feel confident enough of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nYour letters are always very pleasant to us, and that of to-day is very\r\ngratifying.\r\n\r\nYes, we, too, should not have said this was the way in which we would\r\nhave had slavery destroyed,--by no means. We wished it by a slow process\r\nwhich would have cost no life, injured no property, but benefited all as\r\nit went on. But our misguided Southern brethren would have it otherwise,\r\nand so it was. And it is something to be glad of, after all, that it was\r\ndone in our day, and we think thoroughly. I take a weekly newspaper, the\r\n“Nation,” which is on the plan of the “Spectator” and the “Saturday\r\nReview,” etc., but we have few good paragraph-writers, and our best\r\nwriters will not write. But this paper may interest you, at least in the\r\nletters of its correspondent traveling in the South. I post some\r\nnumbers to your address, and I will send some more if you care to see\r\nthem. Otherwise the numbers are thrown aside, for I do not keep them.\r\n\r\nEven here we have the same sort of liking for Palmerston which the mass\r\nof English have, and no better reason to give for it; and we look with a\r\nsort of fascinated interest upon Gladstone, and expect to see him\r\npremier before long, in a year or two, and we wonder how he will get on\r\nin so critical a position as he will be in. Goldwin Smith I met, but saw\r\nnot very much of. He was in very delicate health. Fraser I did not see,\r\nthough he was my father-in-law’s guest, and was very much liked by all.\r\nBoth had troops of friends. Mrs. Gray and I were in the country when\r\nFraser was at Mr. Loring’s house on the shore.\r\n\r\nThe short space left on my sheet must be all devoted to an earnest\r\nexhortation for you to follow your two friends’ example. Come over and\r\nsee us, and make our quiet house your home, from which you can travel as\r\nmuch as you like and see the country in this interesting phase. Pray\r\nthink of it seriously. The expense need not be great.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gray, with kindest remembrances, seconds my request, and wishes it\r\nextended to Mrs. Church.\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nMay 15, 1865.\r\n\r\nYour kind letter of the 19th ult. crossed a brief note from me. I am too\r\nmuch distracted with work at this season to write letters on our\r\naffairs, and if I once begin, I should not know where to stop. You have\r\nalways been sympathizing and just, and I appreciate your hearty\r\ncongratulations on the success of our just endeavors. You have since had\r\nmuch more to rejoice over, as well as to sorrow with us. But the noble\r\nmanner in which our country has borne itself should give you real\r\nsatisfaction. We appreciate, too, the good feeling of England in its\r\nhearty grief at the murder of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nDon’t talk about our “hating” you, nor suppose that we want to rob you\r\nof Canada, for which nobody cares.\r\n\r\nWe think we have been ill-used by you, when you thought us weak and\r\nbroken, and when we expected better things. We have learned that we must\r\nbe strong to live in peace and comfort with England, otherwise we should\r\nhave to eat much dirt. But now that we are on our feet again, all will\r\ngo well, and hatred will disappear. Indeed I see little of that.\r\n\r\nI must look to the Plantago dimorphism, for, as you say, these plants,\r\nfertilized by the wind, would gain nothing by being dimorphic. No\r\ndimorphic species grows very near here, nor can I now get seeds of P.\r\nVirginica. Perhaps a good look at even dried specimens, under your\r\nhints, may settle the matter.\r\n\r\nI was exceedingly interested with the Lythrum paper (but had no time to\r\nwrite a notice of it), and I wait expectingly for your Climbing plants.\r\nYou are the very prince of investigators. We hope presently to make Mrs.\r\nWedgewood’s acquaintance.\r\n\r\nJuly 24.\r\n\r\nI am reading in snatches your admirable paper on Climbing plants,--as\r\nyet only eighty-eight pages of it, and am watching with great interest\r\nall the climbers I have at hand. What a nice piece of work you have made\r\nof it!\r\n\r\nI see you explain and illustrate at length the double turn of a caught\r\ntendril. Is it not enough to say that, with both ends fixed, if it\r\nshortens, say by the contraction of one side, it must by mechanical\r\nnecessity turn its coil different ways from a neutral point?\r\n\r\nEre this, Mrs. Wedgewood should be back from Canada, but I have not yet\r\nlearned that she is so. She was to let me know, and we would have a day\r\non the shore, where Mr. Loring lives in summer,--a pretty bit of\r\ncountry. But it is now too late.\r\n\r\nI wish she could have been here on Friday, when we welcomed back our\r\nHarvard men who had been in the war,--over five hundred of them,--and\r\nremembered those who had died for their country. What a day we had!\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis richly deserves to be hanged. We are willing to leave\r\nthe case in the hands of the government, who must take the\r\nresponsibility. If I were responsible, I would have him tried for\r\ntreason (the worst of crimes in a republic), convicted, sentenced to\r\ndeath; and then I think I should commute the penalty, not out of any\r\nconsideration for him, but from policy, and for his more complete\r\nhumiliation. The only letters I have received expressing a desire to\r\nhang him are from rebeldom itself,--from Alabama. You see slavery is\r\ndead, dead,--an absolute unanimity as to this. The revolted States will\r\nbehave as badly as they can, but they are so thoroughly whipped that\r\nthey can’t stir, hand or foot, and we are disbanding all our armies,--a\r\ncorporal’s guard is enough to hold South Carolina. Seriously, there are\r\ndifficult questions before us, but only one result is possible: the\r\nSouth must be renovated, and Yankeefied.\r\n\r\nWell, take good care of yourself, and let me know that you are again in\r\ncomfortable condition.\r\n\r\nNovember 6.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear from you, and to see half your letter of October\r\n19 in your own handwriting is a good sign. I do hope you may get a\r\ncomfortable winter, and bring out your next volume without breaking\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nI am pleased that you approve my abstract of your Climber paper, but\r\nobserve it was only of the first part of your elaborate article. But as\r\nto the praise you speak of, I am sure you pay me back with interest.\r\n\r\nI lately sent “Silliman” as much more--a large part, indeed, extracts,\r\nwhich I could not shorten--on the Tendril-bearing part of your paper.\r\nBut Dana sent me the proof, with all my long extracts omitted for want\r\nof room. This reduced my article to incoherence, so I begged all to be\r\nlaid over for the January number, when I hope to have room. I\r\nentertained our social scientific club here with your article, and all\r\nwere greatly interested.\r\n\r\nAs to climbing roses, they are the strong summer shoots, growing after\r\nflowering, which I find frequently running their heads into dark corners\r\nof the porch over my door, etc.\r\n\r\nThat is very curious, but quite what I looked for, that dimorphous\r\nspecies self-fertilized should act like hybrids (sterile or dwarf,\r\netc.).\r\n\r\nYou must publish these facts in some brief article.\r\n\r\n“Stephens” (Stevens) was a New Yorker; is dead, years ago; wrote most\r\namusing and popular travels; in Egypt, as well. Central America was his\r\nfirst and freshest book, but only amusing, as far as I recollect.\r\n\r\nSo Palmerston is gone. A fine specimen of a John Bull he was, a very\r\ntypical specimen. We Yankees can’t help admiring and liking him, though\r\nnot for any good he ever did us. But as for his successor, he is a prig,\r\na juiceless stick.\r\n\r\nDon’t you think Adams pays him back nicely for proposing that they\r\nshould sit down and rejoice together over the abolition of slavery? Just\r\nsee how the world has moved. Turn back to Russell’s _lecture_ to be read\r\nto Mr. Lincoln on occasion of his proclamation of emancipation!\r\n\r\nGood-by, my dear, good fellow, and recover health as fast as ever you\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 28, 1865.\r\n\r\nI am not going on so any more. A letter from me you shall have. To be\r\nsure I have had none from you since you sailed, but that is no matter.\r\nCollege and garden and herbarium work together are enough to drive one\r\nmad; but now the college work begins to hold up, and will soon be over.\r\nAnd as to herbarium, Fendler has at length promised to come at the end\r\nof the summer and help me--all winter at least, perhaps longer....\r\n\r\nOh, yes! I have yours of “Habana,” May 9th, with your shipboard studies\r\non the variations of Chapman and Grisebach. Well, sometimes one wrong,\r\nsometimes the other; sometimes a difference as to who the author of a\r\nbook is,--Michaux, whose name is on the work, Richard, who wrote it\r\nincog.\r\n\r\nI inclose my last from Grisebach. I am hoping to arrange to have the\r\ncatalogue of Cuba plants printed or stereotyped at Göttingen, for the\r\nSmithsonian contributions, and have written Grisebach to cultivate his\r\nSpanish influence in the view of having that government at length\r\npatronize effectively the bringing out of a Flora Cubensis, by Wright\r\nand Grisebach.\r\n\r\nYou owe this letter partly to the general disturbance of an uneasy\r\nconscience, and partly to a sudden cold caught by carelessness in hot\r\nweather, which unfits me for more driving work. It is getting better. I\r\nhope to write you again before I catch a new one.\r\n\r\nJuly 4, Eighty-ninth Anniversary\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nYours of June 9-21 reached me the very day that I mailed my last missive\r\nto you, a good long letter. Here is a fine letter from you, showing how\r\nbusy and active a man you are. Pretty well for a man of your age to be\r\nshinning up palm-trees, and barking your shins. Be careful! Grisebach\r\nwill take your criticisms all right, no doubt. Yesterday I got the\r\ninclosed from him. Very well. Is the Cuban M. Sauvalle?...\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker has sent me a specimen of Welwitschia, that queer African\r\ntree a foot high, many years old, and with only two leaves, and those\r\nall in shreds....\r\n\r\nSeptember 5.\r\n\r\n... Dear, good Sir William Hooker is dead,--of diphtheria,--on the 15th\r\nAugust, six weeks over eighty years. I have no news yet from the family;\r\nbut learn indirectly that Dr. Hooker is sick, “a gastric affection.” I\r\ndo hope it is nothing dangerous....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray wrote for the “American Journal of Science”[61] a memoir of\r\nhis dear friend, Sir William Hooker, in which, after describing his\r\nimmense labors in publications of so many different branches, he says:--\r\n\r\n“Our survey of what Sir William Hooker did for science would be\r\nincomplete indeed if it were confined to his published works, numerous\r\nand important as they are, and the wise and efficient administration\r\nthrough which, in a short space of twenty-four years, a queen’s flower\r\nand kitchen garden and pleasure grounds have been transformed into an\r\nimperial botanical establishment of unrivaled interest and value.\r\nAccount should be taken of the spirit in which he worked, of the\r\nresearches and explorations he promoted, of the aid and encouragement he\r\nextended to his fellow-laborers, especially to young and rising\r\nbotanists, and of the means and appliances he gathered for their use no\r\nless than his own.\r\n\r\n“The single-mindedness with which he gave himself to his scientific\r\nwork, and the conscientiousness with which he lived for science while he\r\nlived by it, were above all praise. Eminently fitted to shine in society\r\n... he never dissipated his time and energies in the round of\r\nfashionable life, but ever avoided the social prominence and worldly\r\ndistractions which some sedulously seek....\r\n\r\n“Nor was there in him the least manifestation of a tendency to\r\novershadow the science with his own importance, or of indifference to\r\nits general advancement....\r\n\r\n“To the wide circle of botanists in which he has long filled so\r\nconspicuous a place, ... it is superfluous to say that Sir William\r\nHooker was one of the most admirable of men, a model Christian\r\ngentleman.”\r\n\r\nDr. Gray was appointed by Mr. Peabody himself a member of the “Board of\r\nTrustees of the Peabody Museum of American Archæology and Ethnology in\r\nconnection with Harvard University” when it was founded in 1866. The\r\nHon. Robert C. Winthrop, offering the resolutions in memory of Dr. Gray,\r\nat the meeting in 1888, says, “From first to last, as I can bear\r\nwitness, he was a most faithful and valuable member of our Board; he was\r\nalways at our meetings and took an active interest in all our work. In\r\n1874, on the death of Jeffries Wyman, he voluntarily assumed the\r\ncuratorship of our Museum, and did excellent service until the\r\nappointment of Professor Putnam.”\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nSunday evening, February 25, 1866.\r\n\r\nThe number of the “Guardian” followed closely upon your note of the 9th\r\ninstant, and I have just risen from the reading of your review of “Ecce\r\nHomo.” I knew nothing of this remarkable book, beyond having seen the\r\ntitle. The notice in the “Spectator” had escaped me, or rather, through\r\na change in the order of circulation in our book club, that number of\r\n“Spectator” has not yet come round to me. But I have to thank you\r\nheartily for calling my attention to it, and especially for sending me\r\nyour own published and well-considered thoughts of it. I greatly admire\r\nyour analysis of the book, and what I thus learn of it greatly impresses\r\nme. I shall procure it without delay. I long, not only to read it\r\nmyself, but to put it into the hands of some friends. Such a production\r\nis timely, and will be very useful. I hope the unknown writer will go\r\non, and as he goes on bring out, in the same fresh and untechnical way,\r\nall the essentials of Christian belief. Even if he does not, it will\r\nhave great value as it is; and one will be curious to see how he can\r\nfail to raise the superstructure which this foundation seems to be\r\ndesigned to bear. I have long thought it very important that these\r\nsubjects and the whole range of connected questions need to be treated\r\nby a layman from an unprofessional point of view, and quite apart from\r\ntheological language or conventional modes of thought, say by a lawyer\r\nof a judicial turn of mind, or by a physicist or naturalist, who\r\nunderstands and feels the scientific difficulties, and the prevalent\r\nstate of mind, especially among scientific people, which most divines\r\npersist in ignoring.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I get this book, and have attentively read it, I shall\r\nprobably wish to speak of it again to you. If I find that it does not\r\nreceive notice in this country, I will see that attention is in some way\r\ncalled to it. But I should think it likely to attract attention in this\r\ncountry at once.\r\n\r\nI have never thanked you for your letter of December 6, and for the\r\nhope, faint though it be, that you may come over and see us some day.\r\nPray don’t give over the thought, and some day you may chance to bring\r\nit about. Cambridge is not a bad point from which to sally forth in\r\nlittle explorations of American life....\r\n\r\nWe have much anxiety as to what we can do with the South now we have got\r\nit; and our President Johnson is not a Lincoln. The breach which has\r\njust occurred, and which may cause great trouble, has been feared for\r\nsome time; and the blame is to be assigned in part to the indiscretion\r\nand impracticability of a few of the advanced Republican leaders. We\r\nhave survived worse scenes and darker prospects, and shall surmount\r\nthese troubles, I trust, in time. But here things cannot always be done\r\nin the wisest way....\r\n\r\nI imagine Earl Russell is safe for a year or two, since no other minstry\r\ncould well be found to replace him. I should like, before long, to see\r\nGladstone at the helm.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\n... The small parcel from Andersson[62] has come. From him I have a nice\r\noil copy of the portrait of Linnæus,[63] painted by Madame Andersson.\r\n\r\nChapman[64] is here, excellent, loyal man all through; hates\r\ncopperheads; is soon going back, so that you can write him at\r\nApalachicola for Junci. I have told him what you are at with the genus.\r\n\r\nMarch 20, 1866.\r\n\r\nI have got Mann[65] well installed in Fendler’s place, and he is doing\r\nwell, doing botanical work, too, on his Sandwich Island plants; will\r\nbring out an Enum. Pl. Hawaiens....\r\n\r\nJuly 30.\r\n\r\nBack to-day from a coasting voyage of four or five days, I find yours of\r\n25th instant....\r\n\r\nI have promised Clinton[66] I will go to Buffalo, to the meeting\r\nreviving the American Association; then back home, to work, by 20th\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nAbout the Prussian war I think as you do. About domestic matters I have\r\nnot changed at all my mode of thinking, as I know. But no time for these\r\nthings....\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nMay 19, 1866.\r\n\r\n... I am so driven, so distracted. Bless your stars you are not a\r\nprofessor, and president of Academy, and have a botanical garden and no\r\ngardener well trained, and have students, and everything. My\r\ncorrespondence all in arrears, and I am getting hardened and don’t\r\ncare....\r\n\r\nYou know I am always hard pressed and hard worked at this season; and\r\nthis year it is far worse than ever. Besides the bother of my classes,\r\nunusually bothering on the new arrangement, there is a new gardener and\r\na great deficit or rather deficiency of funds to carry on the Garden, so\r\nI have to run that concern pretty much myself. And, to crown all, my\r\nlittle new French gardener, in his anxiety over the work, has got into a\r\nstate of nervous excitement, gets no sleep nights, and if not soon\r\nrelieved will, I fear, become truly insane.... If he continues half\r\ncrazed, you may expect me crazed next. Then there are some special\r\nscientific students working up here, to add to my botheration.\r\n\r\nSo do not you “growl” at me now if you can help it....\r\n\r\nAlas, your Algæ will be too late for dear Harvey. He is dying of\r\nconsumption, and we may hear of the end any day. This is all at present\r\nfrom\r\n\r\nYour old, worn-out friend,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nJune 12, 1866.\r\n\r\nWe have as many asters as we can manage in America, and in the northern\r\nhemisphere of the Old World. I pray you keep out at least Australian\r\nthings if it be possible.\r\n\r\nI envy you more and more in being able to devote yourself to systematic\r\nbotany steadily, without the distraction and sad consumption of time in\r\nprofessional and administrative duties and avocations, which make havoc\r\nof the opportunities of most botanists, and make their work which they\r\nare able to do far less valuable than it would otherwise be. And you\r\nwork on with such quiet determination! The lamented losses of the last\r\nyear or two have already made you the Nestor, though I cannot think you\r\nold. I do hope you have a fair number of good working years yet, in\r\nwhich you can make your great experience tell to utmost advantage....\r\n\r\nMuch against my will, I have this summer to work upon a new edition of\r\nmy “Manual of the Northern United States Botany,” to which there is much\r\nto be done. I shall not, however, so recast the work as I should if I\r\ncould defer it till I had blocked out the outlines of a similar but much\r\nlarger volume for all the United States of America, and till your\r\n“Genera Flora” had been carried much farther.\r\n\r\nWhat do you intend for this summer? A Continental excursion?\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Bentham, most cordially yours,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nDr. Farlow, in his memoir in “Proceedings of the American Academy,”\r\nspeaks of the great interest which Dr. Gray took at this time in\r\nobserving tendrils and climbing plants. The glass corridor then\r\nconnecting the herbarium and his study was very much occupied by\r\nclimbers, and notes were constantly taken of times of revolution, etc.\r\nHe says, “Dr. Gray hardly ever passed in or out of the herbarium without\r\nstroking (patting them on the back by way of encouraging them, it almost\r\nseemed) the tendrils of the climbers on the walls and porch; and on the\r\nannouncement that a student had discovered another case of\r\ncross-fertilization in the garden, he would rush out bare-headed and\r\nbreathless, like a schoolboy, to see the thing with his own critical\r\neyes.”\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nMay 7, 1866.\r\n\r\nI am so delighted to get a letter from you, written with your own hand,\r\nand to see that you can work again a little.\r\n\r\nI have no new facts about the influence of pollen on fruits, nor about\r\ninfluence of grafts.\r\n\r\nI have got a little plant of Bignonia capreolata growing here. I punched\r\na lot of holes into the shady side of a lath; the tendrils thrust their\r\nends in; also into a cornice, but did not stay; either the movement of\r\nthe stem or tendril, or, at length, the shortening of the body of the\r\ntendril by coiling, which it does promptly, brought all away. I have\r\nstuck some cotton on to the lath at the proper height for the next pair\r\nof tendrils. The tendril near by stuck fast at once, and is beginning to\r\ndevelop the disks, and now the tendril of the other leaf has bent\r\nabruptly round, and seized the cotton with avidity. Are there any new\r\nobservations I can make?\r\n\r\nThe Fenian scare, we have supposed here, was mainly a plan of certain\r\nrogues here to fleece their poor countrymen and women, poor servants and\r\nworking-men! Nothing more could come of it. But I sadly fear many here\r\nhave enjoyed the trouble it has given and the alarm it has excited,\r\nespecially among our neighbors in New Brunswick, who rather enjoyed our\r\nwoes two or three years ago.\r\n\r\nYes, slavery is thoroughly done for. We have a bad set to deal with at\r\nthe South; and holding wolf by the ears is no pleasant nor hopeful\r\noccupation, as the temper of the wolf does not improve under the\r\nholding. But we shall jangle out of the difficulty in time, even with\r\nsuch a crooked character as our President to deal with also.\r\n\r\nBring out the book on Variation soon.\r\n\r\nJuly 3.\r\n\r\n... So there is war on the Continent; really a war “for empire,” as Lord\r\nRussell said our war was. Now our war was a simple necessity; this\r\nContinental one a crime, in which all parties participate. I wish, but\r\ndo not expect, Prussia to be crushed as one result. I wish all her coast\r\ncould be annexed to Denmark! However, it is no affair of ours, being on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic. And when a nation can get strength and\r\npower by robbery, it will be likely to rob.\r\n\r\nAugust 7.\r\n\r\n... You should study Wyman’s observations in his own papers. He is\r\nalways careful to keep his inferences close to his facts, and is as good\r\nan experimenter, I judge, as he is an observer. He has a new series of\r\nobservations to publish. I think that he has not at all pronounced in\r\nfavor of spontaneous generation, but I will bet on his experiments\r\nagainst Pasteur, any day.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nNovember 23.\r\n\r\nYou may well complain that I neglect you. But--\r\n\r\n1. I had, till now, nothing special to write.\r\n\r\n2. I have been daily expecting to hear from Grisebach, and have sheets\r\nto send you, or the copies via Westermann. But not a bit of it yet. The\r\nconquest of Hanover by the Prussians seems to have annihilated\r\nGrisebach.\r\n\r\n3. I have been, am so--_busy_ is not the word for it. I can’t think of\r\nany to express it. I suppose that I have now lying by me more than fifty\r\nunanswered letters, though I keep answering the most pressing as fast\r\nnearly as they come in. But the rest get neglected, inevitably. I read\r\nyour letters and follow your work in Cuba with interest. I want you to\r\nget all the plants you can (but I see not that you can exhaust Cuba),\r\nand then come and settle down here, and work up, as you only can, a nice\r\nFlora Cubana. That you are bound to do, just as I am to do the Flora of\r\nNorth America. I see some faint prospect that I may yet, and before very\r\nlong, be able to sit down to it. But you and I are bound to do these two\r\nthings yet!...\r\n\r\nThe seeds I put loose in this sheet are Cinchona officinalis. Get the\r\ntree introduced into your cooler region, that is, the Caffetals of east\r\nCuba, and the tree will be commercially important in time, and you will\r\nbe a benefactor of your species. Enough for once.\r\n\r\nEver your old friend,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nNovember 20, 1866.\r\n\r\nDEAR ENGELMANN,--Yes, I have a heap of unanswered letters from you. But\r\nI have not one moment of time.\r\n\r\nI have copy of “Manual” in printer’s hands up to Compositæ, and am only\r\nnow two days ahead; have been only two hours ahead day after day!! It is\r\nawful! So much other work too!...\r\n\r\nIf I could get five hundred to one thousand more a year I would at once\r\nresign professorship and salary....\r\n\r\nI am well, never more hearty; but worked like a coach-horse. I have got\r\nmy fund raised for the Garden: small, but we have now clear $2,500 or\r\n$2,600 a year for Garden.\r\n\r\nFebruary 27, 1867.\r\n\r\nHow much I am indebted to you! No one else who undertakes to help me\r\never makes out much, at least to save me time and trouble....\r\n\r\nI have not time to write details of the little I know about the National\r\nAcademy. But I have seen enough to make it clear that I should not be\r\ntaking any more responsibility about it. So last month I sent my\r\nresignation. They have put me on the list of Honorary Members. The\r\nAmerican Academy is as much as I want to attend to, and I do my duty to\r\nsociety in looking well after that....\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nSeptember 10, 1866.\r\n\r\n... The war near you was sharp and quick. Switzerland is as fortunately\r\nplaced as any small nation can be, when surrounded by strong ones; but\r\nyou see that in this world only strength can be relied on. See what\r\nindignity small and weak nations have to suffer. I trust present peace\r\nmay last to consolidate a new Germany. But if not, you may have to dread\r\na more general upturning on the Continent.\r\n\r\nOctober 21, 1867.\r\n\r\n... Your analysis of the whole subject of rules in nomenclature I think\r\nis sound and lawyer-like, or rather _judicial_, as well as judicious.\r\nThere are dangers and inconveniences on every side, and good sense and\r\ndiscretion are needed in the application of these as of all rules....\r\n\r\nVery faithfully yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nJanuary 21, 1867.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BENTHAM,--Many thanks for your kind remembrance of us in your\r\nletter at the end of the year, which reached me only three or four days\r\nago. I avail myself of the first foreign post since to return, with Mrs.\r\nGray’s love, our heartiest good wishes to Mrs. Bentham and yourself, and\r\nI trust you will be able to keep up yet, for a good many precious years,\r\nthe steady botanical work which you make so telling....\r\n\r\nI have no doubt of the full and entire correctness of the principles you\r\nwork on; and the Kew Floras and the “Genera Plantarum” will more than\r\nanything else determine the public botanical opinion and mode of working\r\nfor the next generation. But I suspect that there will remain after all\r\na great many monotypic genera (consider how many of the most distinct\r\ngenera are so, or nearly so); and I imagine it is best to work without\r\nprejudice for or against them.\r\n\r\nI dare promise I shall be satisfied with all you have done in Compositæ.\r\nAs to Umbelliferæ, I wish you joy of the job, and do hope you will\r\nreduce the genera twenty per cent at least. I never could take the least\r\nsatisfaction in them. I never could collate our Umbelliferæ with\r\nEuropean genera, and I have no clear conception of more than half a\r\ndozen of our genera....\r\n\r\nEver, dear Bentham, yours most cordially,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 26, 1867.\r\n\r\nThis is to acknowledge yours of February 28.\r\n\r\nYou see I have printed your queries[67] privately (fifty copies), as the\r\nbest way of putting them where useful answers may be expected. Most of\r\nthem will go into the hands of agents of the Freedmen’s Bureau, etc.\r\nOthers to persons I or Wyman may know and rely on. I wish I had had them\r\nsooner. My crony Wyman has been two months in Florida, but will be home\r\nagain before I could send to him.\r\n\r\nI did not write the article in the “Nation” on Popular Lecturing, though\r\nit contains so many things I have said over and over that it startled\r\nme. Then it hits so many nails square on the head that I should think it\r\ncould be written only in Cambridge or hereabouts.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed to be written by a person in New York, but I\r\nsuspect a person near by here,--only suspect....\r\n\r\nYes, Magnolia seeds hang out awhile in autumn, finally stretch and break\r\nthe threads of spiral vessels. Whether birds eat them I don’t know. They\r\nlook enticing and have a pulpy coat, are bitter and spicy.\r\n\r\nShall I send you more of these circulars?\r\n\r\nI shall send to Indian people too.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nApril 2, 1867.\r\n\r\nI sent your twenty dollars to aid the subscription for the starving\r\nSoutherners. There have been handsome sums raised for them in the\r\nNorthern States. But I am afraid you must get most imperfect and\r\none-sided statements of the doings of Congress by the tone of your\r\nletters, and decidedly need enlightenment. It is the President, not\r\nCongress, that needs to learn the Constitution and the laws of the land.\r\nAnd your Southern loyal friends, if you could get voice of them, would\r\nbeg Congress to take even more urgent steps for their protection and\r\ndefense by reconstruction. However, things seem to be going on now\r\npretty satisfactorily. The President is sinking into his deserved\r\ninsignificance, and the leading rebels are coming out decidedly more\r\nsensibly than many of their professed Northern friends. And we hope,\r\ntherefore, that they may begin to give some fair chance to the loyal men\r\nof the South to be heard and to get their rights, which have been\r\nindeed shamefully trampled upon by the President and the dominant party\r\nat the South....\r\n\r\nI have not time to answer all your interesting botanical notes, and can\r\nonly thank you for them. I hope you will continue to keep well.\r\n\r\nOur spring is late and wet. There is still quite a covering of snow in\r\nthe garden, and we have had a deal of it in the winter, and wretched\r\nwalking and getting about in every way. Happy you, in the tropics.\r\n\r\nYou ask who Austin[68] is. He was an old protégé of Dr. Torrey; lives\r\nnow in New Jersey, and studies Lemnaceæ and Hepaticæ.\r\n\r\n... You will be more delighted than I am to know that the Democrats have\r\nprobably carried Connecticut. But I am not much the contrary; for the\r\nRepublicans are too many in Congress for their own good, or ours, and it\r\nsecures the defeat of Barnum for Congress; as it should be....\r\n\r\nApril 8.\r\n\r\nI have been having a Sunday’s work over your plants.\r\n\r\nIt grieves my heart and will grieve yours badly when I tell you that\r\nyour boxes were put under a cargo of wet sugar, which drained into them,\r\nand have ruined the collection.\r\n\r\n... As to specimens to dispose of, say only one half or one third of the\r\nwhole mass is left fit for it. Oh dear! God grant you patience! Will you\r\nhave the courage to set to work over again?\r\n\r\nI will try next to tell you what is worst.\r\n\r\nEver your disconsolate,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM M. CANBY.[69]\r\n\r\nJuly 8, 1867.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CANBY, ... I am charmed with what you say of Dionæa, can confirm\r\nsome of it, and believe all the rest. Never mind the anatomy of the leaf\r\nnow--little promise from that; but do go on with experiments on feeding,\r\nand record them carefully, and publish when ready.\r\n\r\nI am going to send your letter to Darwin, who will be delighted, and\r\nwill probably suggest experiments. He has an eminently suggestive mind.\r\n\r\nI suppose you know the slow way Drosera rotundifolia catches flies,\r\ndoubtless for same purpose, though it can absorb the juices only through\r\nits bristles. I always thought it took in only the gases disengaged by\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t know the trick of Drosera, which you should study, too, I\r\nwill tell you, if you write to me at Sauquoit, Oneida County, New York.\r\n\r\nSAUQUOIT, N. Y., July 17.\r\n\r\nI have here yours of 13th.\r\n\r\nIf on leaf of Drosera rotundifolia, in good healthy condition, you put a\r\nsmall fly--somewhat crippled is surer--the sticky pellucid glands will\r\nhold him fast. By degrees (I have never seen it under ten or twelve\r\nhours at least) some of the bristles outside, which have not touched the\r\nfly, will turn inward and bring their sticky tip against the insect;\r\nlater still others and more external ones turn in, and so the fly is\r\nbound by many liliputian bands. As it putrefies, I wonder if the leaf\r\nmerely takes its chance of getting some of the disengaged gases, or\r\nwhether it reabsorbs the clear fluid of the glands, charged now with\r\nsome animal matter.\r\n\r\nIn transplanting some Drosera into a pan with wet moss, the older leaves\r\nmay not work well; but the new ones developed soon will do better. Pray\r\nexperiment upon this and Dionæa. I wonder if there ever were series of\r\nintermediate states between the inefficient Drosera, and the expert\r\nDionæa....\r\n\r\nAugust 21.\r\n\r\n... I inclose half a letter which came from Darwin this morning. I hope\r\nyou will go on with work on Dionæa....\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN TO A. GRAY.\r\n\r\n(Half of letter referred to above.)\r\n\r\nDOWN, BROMLEY, KENT, August 8.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GRAY,--I have been glad to see Mr. Canby’s interesting letter on\r\nDionæa, and I thank you for sending it; but unfortunately the facts are\r\nnot new to me. Several years ago I observed the secretion of the\r\n“gastric juices” and the close adhesion of the two sides of the leaf\r\nwhen a fly was caught. I keep my notes in such an odd fashion that it\r\nwould take me some time to find them. I am almost sure I ascertained the\r\nacid reaction of the secretion and its antiseptic power, but I cannot\r\nremember whether in this, or in analogous cases, I found its subsequent\r\nreabsorption. This letter fires me up to complete and publish on\r\nDrosera, Dionæa, etc., but when I shall get time I know not. I am\r\nworking like a slave to complete my book.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nJuly 6, 1867.\r\n\r\n... Well, I have been free from much college work for ten days, and am\r\nquite free after Wednesday morning.\r\n\r\nI seem as well as possible, bright and clear, and should be content just\r\nto visit my old mother and come right back to work on Californian\r\nplants, which I have been looking at for a few days. But my wife says I\r\nshall take four weeks, and on being weighed I find that my former\r\n140-143 lbs. is reduced to 131.\r\n\r\nSo I must waste time and money in traveling, which I am reconciled to,\r\nas Mrs. Gray needs it much.\r\n\r\nFrom Oneida County, New York, I am going (with Mrs. G.) to drive into\r\nnorthwest and central Pennsylvania and then visit a sister in Michigan.\r\nMrs. Gray insists that we must go to Chicago, which she wishes to see,\r\nthough I do not. I hate towns, especially new ones. Only think how near\r\nI shall be to you!\r\n\r\nSo you saw old Bigelow, who is quite delighted with Shaw’s grounds, etc.\r\n\r\nTorrey has just made me a little visit. Good, kind soul he is....\r\n\r\nAugust 15.\r\n\r\nWe got home three days ago. Hot weather broke down my wife’s courage, as\r\nI feared, and we went no farther west than Tecumseh, Michigan; made a\r\nshort visit to Sullivant at Columbus, then meandered through west and\r\nnorth of Pennsylvania to central New York again, and hearing of Mrs.\r\nGray’s father’s illness came rapidly home....\r\n\r\nI am very well; have put on three pounds’ weight.\r\n\r\nWe must go and see you and all the great West at some proper season,\r\nspring or late fall....\r\n\r\nI germinated for two years Nelumbium, but soon lose them. If you can,\r\nsend me some seeds this fall to try once more....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nOctober 14, 1867.\r\n\r\n... Yes, I did receive your address,[70] read it hastily, and sent it to\r\n“Silliman’s Journal” to be reprinted. It was too late for the September\r\nnumber, but will be the leading article in the November number. I have\r\nread a proof and am daily expecting a printed sheet, which I can send to\r\nyou, with one or two little remarks. I was exceedingly pleased with it;\r\nso is Professor Henry. We both wondered how you could have so exactly\r\nhit not one, but several nails on the head, as you have done. It will be\r\nmuch read here, and will be truly useful.\r\n\r\nYou remind me that I ought to have criticised your working of Australian\r\nCompositæ. The trouble is, that, except North American genera, these\r\nthings have long been quite out of my head. It will be unsafe for me to\r\napprove or otherwise till I can get at work a little over them, which it\r\nis not likely I can at present. I just fancy that in your dislike of\r\nmonotypic genera--which you abhor as nature does a vacuum--you may have\r\nlumped up the angiantheous genera rather too much.\r\n\r\nI am straining every nerve to get into a position to get at a synopsis\r\nof North American plants, and my present work upon Bolander’s collection\r\nis a part of the preparation. But I cannot lay the corner-stone till\r\ncollege work is over, next July. Meanwhile I want suggestions as to\r\nform, and how to condense references to the utmost and crowd a page, yet\r\nleaving it clear and comely. When I have got the thing blocked out, and\r\nhave worked up a part, then Mrs. G. and I hope to go over and see you,\r\nand to stay a good long while. Adieu, till next week.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nDecember 5, 1867.\r\n\r\nBefore the year closes I mean you shall have a note from me, to renew on\r\nmy part an intercourse which has been interrupted through negligence of\r\nmine. I find I get more and more overloaded as I grow older, and I dare\r\nsay you find it the same. Still we must exchange a word now and then.\r\n\r\nI have to tell you of the severe loss we have had in the death, in\r\nOctober, of Mrs. Gray’s good and kind father, Mr. Loring. He and my wife\r\nwere very much to each other, and in former years had been unusually\r\nintimate companions; and his death at seventy-three, quite unexpected\r\ntill within a few weeks of the event, is very much felt. Mrs. Gray’s own\r\nhealth, too, is but poor, though on the whole I trust it is becoming\r\nfirmer.\r\n\r\nIf you see your friend Mr. Fraser (whom I, unfortunately, did not) you\r\nmay learn from him what manner of man Mr. Loring was. I wish I knew him,\r\nto say to him how highly we value a letter he lately addressed to Mrs.\r\nLoring, and which I read yesterday,--so full of sympathy and just\r\nappreciation.\r\n\r\nMr. Fraser, you may be sure, is very much thought of here.\r\n\r\nI hope that Dr. Hooker, of Kew, has sent on to you the numbers of the\r\n“Nation,” which I have for a year or more regularly posted to him,\r\noriginally requesting he should do so. But it is quite likely the busy\r\nman has forgotten all about it.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have passed my fifty-seventh anniversary, in firm health,\r\nfeeling my age only in a treacherous memory--as respects names, etc.,\r\nnot as to events or friends. The memory of our delightful visit to\r\nOxford is ever fresh.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe other evening here I discoursed at our private club, by giving them\r\nan abstract of the chapters on Inheritance and Pangenesis; the former\r\nfor Professor Bowen’s benefit. He and Agassiz took it all very well; and\r\npangenesis seemed to strike all of us as being as good an hypothesis as\r\none can now make....\r\n\r\nOn inside of leaf of Dionæa see the copious glands for secreting gastric\r\njuice.\r\n\r\n... I do not wonder at your book[71] being taken up at once, by the\r\ngreat numbers of people who need and understand it, and the thousands\r\nwho jump at anything written by so notorious a writer as you are. The\r\n“Origin” will sell anything; and I believe people will get more for\r\ntheir money in this book than in even that, if they care for facts,\r\nwhich generally they do not.\r\n\r\nMay 25.\r\n\r\nI want to write you a long letter, but the time is not to be had now.\r\nMany thanks for yours of May 8.\r\n\r\nMy notice of your book in the “Nation” was not intended to have anything\r\nin it, except for the groundlings; was only to make the book known and\r\nunderstood, a light affair.\r\n\r\nMy preface was written at the publishers’ request simply because yours\r\nhad not come. The fellows put in both. The edition is not very nicely\r\nprinted. Judging from the newspaper notices I think the book is taking\r\nfamously. That agricultural newspaper is taken by the hundred thousand\r\nin the country. As to close of my article, to match close of your\r\nbook,--you see plainly I was put on the defense by your reference to an\r\nold hazardous remark of mine. I found your stone-house argument\r\nunanswerable in substance (for the notion of design must after all rest\r\nmostly on faith, and on accumulation of adaptations, etc.); so all I\r\ncould do was to find a vulnerable spot in the shaping of it, fire my\r\nlittle shot, and run away in the smoke.\r\n\r\nOf course I understand your argument perfectly, and feel the weight of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe were intensely amused at the Edinburgh man, who suggests that I could\r\neasily smash you into little pieces! I wish he may live to see it done!\r\n\r\nI am half dead with drudgery, half of it at least for other people; see\r\nno relief but to break up, and run over, with wife, who needs a change,\r\nto your side of the water for a good long while.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nJune 22, 1868.\r\n\r\nI have to send you--in a hasty line--my best thanks for remembering me\r\nso kindly: 1. In your letter of January 17, which I am so tardy in\r\nresponding to.\r\n\r\n2. The copy of Hooker edited by you, which I was pleased to have.\r\n\r\n3. Your sermon at St. Mary’s, which Mrs. Gray and I both read with much\r\ninterest. I admired your handling of an important topic, and the solid\r\nstrength which comes from moderation of statement. It reminded me much\r\nof one of our best sermonizers here, who, though a good deal heterodox\r\n(I am sorry to say), treats such subjects more impressively than any one\r\nelse and much in that way, his guarded understatements or concessions\r\ntelling heavily in the argument.\r\n\r\nI read and think of nothing but botany of late, having been too hard\r\npressed for a long while. But last Sunday I read with interest the\r\nlatter part of Mr. Gladstone’s essay on “Ecce Homo.”\r\n\r\nThere is something which seems to me very admirable and attachable about\r\nGladstone. I wonder if his church friends and supporters will mostly\r\ndrop him at the coming struggle, for his action looking to the\r\ndisestablishment of the Irish church.\r\n\r\nBut the gist of my present note is to say, that I have got a year’s\r\nleave of absence, and Mrs. Gray and I expect to cross over to England in\r\ntwo months.\r\n\r\nI find I must break up a set of engagements and of work, mainly for\r\nothers, which absorbs too much of my time, and Mrs. Gray’s health makes\r\nme anxious to avoid another winter here, at present. The change will be\r\ngood for us both. We mean to pass the whole autumn in England, mostly at\r\nKew, and most of the winter in Italy and perhaps Egypt, where Mrs.\r\nLoring, now on the Continent (tell Mr. Fraser), expects to be, and we\r\nmay be able to join the party, in a climate which may be advantageous\r\nafter such a winter as our last.\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTRAVEL IN EUROPE AND AMERICA.\r\n\r\n1868-1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Gray made his fourth journey to Europe in the fall of 1868. He\r\nlanded in September, and went at once to Kew, where he remained most of\r\nthe time at work in the herbarium until November. He made a short round\r\nof visits, first to Mr. Church, who was then rector of Whatley, a\r\nvillage of Somersetshire, where, with Mrs. Gray, he enjoyed to the full\r\nhis stay in one of the loveliest parts of rural England. They went also\r\nto Down to pay a visit to Darwin, and with them went Dr. and Mrs.\r\nHooker, with their two eldest children, and Professor Tyndall. Those\r\nwere days never to be forgotten. In November, Dr. and Mrs. Gray joined\r\nsome family friends in Paris, with whom they went to Egypt and passed\r\nthe winter on the Nile, taking the longest vacation, Dr. Gray said, he\r\nhad ever enjoyed. Upon their return they passed through Italy,\r\nSwitzerland, and Germany, where old botanical acquaintances were\r\nrenewed, and some persons seen whom he had known only by correspondence.\r\nIn England he again worked at Kew, and repeated the visits at Whatley\r\nand Down, sailing for America, November 9, 1869.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nDOWN, BROMLEY, KENT, October 29, 1868.\r\n\r\nIn all these busy days I have neglected your kind letter of October 6,\r\npartly in the expectation that I might be able to announce to you\r\ndefinitely the time we should reach Paris. I can even now only say that\r\nwe expect to be there between the 15th and the 20th of November, and I\r\nthink we shall have just about those days (15-20) in Paris. If we can\r\nmeet, very pleasant it will be; but I dare hardly expect it. My own and\r\nMrs. Gray’s parcels for you shall be left at Masson’s in case we do not\r\nsee you. I am making, with Mrs. Gray, a pleasant week of holiday, most\r\nof it here with Mr. Darwin, whose health just now is, for him,\r\nremarkably good.\r\n\r\nI mean to keep you apprised of our movements; and we may, by some nice\r\nadjustments, meet in Germany. At least, and best of all, in Switzerland,\r\nwhich we shall be likely to reach at midsummer. But I have matured no\r\nplans for anything beyond the winter.\r\n\r\n... I should like to visit Montpellier and to see Planchon, but we\r\nshall, when we reach the Mediterranean, be attached to a party, time\r\nwill be short, and our movements no longer free.\r\n\r\nBentham is working at Kew with his accustomed regularity and diligence.\r\nHooker’s time is much occupied with matters of administration....\r\n\r\nIt must be a great satisfaction to you, that your son not only takes to\r\nbotany, but shows so great talent. I hope the line may not fail, but\r\nthat De Candolle botanists may flourish in the next century as they have\r\nin the nineteenth....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe death of Horace Mann, mentioned in the next letter, Dr. Gray felt\r\nas a great personal loss, as well as a loss to science. He was a young\r\nman of much promise, and he felt on leaving home that, in putting him in\r\ncharge of the herbarium and of the college classes, he could not have\r\nmade any arrangement more promising and satisfactory. He had counted\r\nmuch on his future help as assistant, and anticipated that he would\r\nbecome a very valuable aid in carrying on his work, for he had patience,\r\nconscientiousness, and steady diligence. Mr. Mann’s lungs were weak, and\r\nhis health required care, but nothing of immediate danger was feared.\r\nBut consumption developed rapidly, and he died after a few weeks’\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nCharles Wright was also working at Cambridge, and took charge of the\r\nherbarium and garden during Dr. Gray’s absence.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nHYÈRES, EAST OF TOULON, November 29, 1868.\r\n\r\nI had yesterday at Marseilles a letter from Mrs. Mann, conveying the sad\r\nintelligence of her son’s death. Very sad it is....\r\n\r\nMy heart bleeds for poor Mrs. Mann, who was wrapped up in Horace, and\r\nwho feels it as the greatest of disappointments. To me, also, it is a\r\nvery great disappointment of long-cherished hopes.\r\n\r\nI expect to find letters at Alexandria when we reach there. We sail from\r\nMarseilles a week hence, going meanwhile to see some of this famous\r\nshore further east....\r\n\r\nCAIRO, December 16, 1868.\r\n\r\nThank you heartily for your letter of November 13. I am here learning\r\nsome subtropical botany, seeing trees growing which you have in Cuba,\r\netc., Parkinsonia, Schinus molle, Carob, etc. Off up the Nile\r\nto-morrow....\r\n\r\nIn brief, I want to retain you permanently as my fidus Achates. You are\r\nto have supreme control of the Garden. When I get home we will see what\r\ncan be done. You will have to cut off Cuba till then, but can work at\r\nFlora Cubensis a good deal of the time. As far as my means can go, you\r\nshall be made as comfortable as possible....\r\n\r\nArrangements were made to have H. sweep and keep clean the herbarium,\r\nand Mrs. L. to scrub when needed. I fear the herbarium may have been\r\nleft to get dusty and untidy. Please take it in hand; ask L. as to\r\ngetting H., or some one, to sweep regularly; let no dusty work that can\r\nbe helped be done in the large herbarium room. Keep coal-ashes dust from\r\nthe fire from getting in, etc. Spare no expense and pains to keep down\r\ndust and dirt....\r\n\r\nAs to dampness in herbarium, look out according to your judgment. Air\r\noccasionally by leaving open doors of cabinets when a good fire is on,\r\nor a dry day out. The north corner of the herbarium is the only place\r\nthat dampness gathers in, except the shelves next the floors. Well, do\r\nthe best you can. Good-by....\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nON BOARD THE STEAMER POONAH,\r\nMARSEILLES HARBOR, December 5, 1868.\r\n\r\nWe started from Paris a few days before the rest, and before Charles\r\nLoring had arrived. We changed the cold north for the bland south in one\r\nnight, going from Paris to Avignon, where I had the pleasure of showing\r\nJ. olive groves, old walled towns, and all sorts of mediæval things;\r\nthen at Nîmes I introduced her to the old Roman world in the\r\nwell-preserved amphitheatre and the beautiful temple called Maison\r\nCarrée, ruins of temples, baths, pavements, and all that,--a charming\r\nplace, of which I had very pleasant memories almost thirty years old.\r\nThen, to revive old memories, we went on to Montpellier; had a nice day\r\nwith Martins[72] and Planchon[73] (whose photographs, as well as\r\nBrongniart’s, I have for you); then we came on via Arles to Marseilles,\r\nwithin an hour of the rest of the party coming direct from Paris. They\r\nall sailed next day; we waited a week, so as to get a view of this\r\ninteresting shore, which we should not be likely ever to visit again. So\r\nwe went first to Hyères, where we first saw orange groves laden with\r\nfruit and tall date-palms, and eucalyptus-trees forty feet high, and all\r\nsuch nice things; roses by the ten thousand in hedges.... Toward evening\r\non the third day, we took a carriage, drove through Mentone along the\r\ncoast road to Monaco; passing by the modern and gaming district, we went\r\ninto the old fortified town to lodge; went round the ramparts in the\r\nmorning, saw more agaves than ever before, and the steep rock 300 feet\r\nhigh covered with opuntias, having stems as thick as my leg, not to say\r\nmy body. Next morning took railroad through Nice to Antibes; visited M.\r\nThuret,[74] the botanist, by appointment; a most charming man, a French\r\nProtestant; his carriage waited for us at the station; a delightful\r\nplace, which made us crazy with delight, 3,000 or more species of the\r\nmost interesting plants growing in the open air, where frost is seldom\r\nseen; plants and trees which starve in conservatories here grow to vast\r\nsize; all kinds of things I never saw growing anyhow before! Roses by\r\nthe thousand. Oh, what a delightful time! But after a nice déjeuner at\r\ntwo o’clock, we were off soon after three to the station, and so reached\r\nMarseilles at nine P.M. yesterday.\r\n\r\nI have left no room to speak of the most sad loss of Mann, very sad. How\r\nit will affect me I cannot tell now, but suppose it will bring us home\r\nnext fall....\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nON THE NILE, BETWEEN\r\nGIRGEH AND DENDERA, January 3, 1869.\r\n\r\nIt is only by an effort of memory that I can recall that seemingly far\r\ndistant week, with which my narrative must commence, when we went, on\r\nMonday, to Nice by railway, and on Tuesday (taking my college colleague,\r\nProfessor Lovering), by a carriage over the finest part of the Corniche\r\nroad to Mentone, and, dropping our companion there, three miles further\r\nto Palazzo Orengo, just within the present Italian frontier; a house\r\nseveral hundred years old, which Mr. Hanbury, our host, has recently\r\nrestored and is beautifying. It is near the base of a steep acclivity,\r\nprojecting a little into the sea and commanding a view of Mentone and\r\nMonaco with the mountains behind and westward far beyond them on the one\r\nside, Ventimiglia and Bordighera on the other, and seaward on rare\r\noccasions giving a view of the mountains of Corsica, over a hundred\r\nmiles distant. One of those rare occasions, well-timed for us, we\r\nenjoyed the next morning before sunrise, and again in the afternoon. All\r\nthat day (Wednesday) we enjoyed the place and its surroundings, and the\r\npleasant society of Mr. and Mrs. Hanbury. They are much liked by the\r\npeople of the hamlet and district, for whom they are doing a great deal,\r\nestablishing a school for girls, with the hearty coöperation of the\r\ncuré. Wednesday, after dinner, this good-will of the neighborhood was\r\nshown in a truly Italian way. The advocate of Ventimiglia, having some\r\nbusiness relative to land to transact with Mr. Hanbury, stayed to\r\ndinner, and then asked permission to read and present a poem which he\r\nhad composed in compliment to Mrs. (Catherine) Hanbury; it being St.\r\nCatherine’s Day. It was delivered with Italian grace and fervor, and an\r\nItalian lady, now one of the family, told us that the versification was\r\nvery choice. Thursday, the grounds and house were thrown open, and a\r\ncollation provided for all the English people at Mentone that Mr.\r\nMoggridge chose to conduct. Earlier I walked over to Mentone to make\r\nsome calls, especially upon young Moggridge,[75] whom you know, and who,\r\nI am sorry to say, had been seriously ill, and was still confined to his\r\nbed. I found him busy over the flowers and plants which his most\r\nattentive and energetic father brings to him from all the mountains\r\naround, cheerful and happy, but I fear he will hardly be able to\r\ncomplete his illustrations of the botany of Mentone. Late in the\r\nafternoon, after enjoying the picnic, a carriage took us to Mentone, and\r\nthence to Monaco, where we slept, in order that the next day might not\r\nbe too fatiguing to Mrs. G. Friday, the railway, newly completed along\r\nthe shore to Monaco, took us through Villa Franca to Nice, and to\r\nAntibes, where I had arranged to have some hours with M. Thuret (a\r\ncharming man and excellent botanist) and his incomparable garden.... The\r\nonly thing lacking was the magnificent view of the snowy Maritime Alps\r\n(of which I saw a sketch made by young Moggridge) which the house\r\ncommands in good weather, but which was hidden from us by clouds and\r\nmist. We reached Marseilles and our hotel in the evening; had Saturday\r\nfor our preparations, and at evening went on board the Poonah, which was\r\nto start for Alexandria early Sunday morning. I need not say anything\r\nabout the scenery of the region we traversed, nor of the pleasure of\r\nfirst seeing date-palms and eucalypti, etc., and orange and lemon trees\r\nin groves, laden with blossom and fruit, and long hedges of roses in\r\nfull bloom in December.\r\n\r\n... Fine weather and smooth water from Sunday to Thursday evening,\r\nespecially during the long and lovely day which opened with Stromboli\r\nand the other Lipari Islands directly before us, and the snowy summit of\r\nEtna in the distance, and closed with the sun setting behind the\r\nsouthern base of Etna, and an inverted pyramid of smoke resting on its\r\nsummit. The day was perfect, and, not to speak of anything else, Etna\r\nwas in full view all day long, except when hidden for an hour by the\r\ncliffs behind Messina. The latter end of the voyage was uncomfortable\r\nenough, the sea very heavy, and glad we were to land at Alexandria,\r\nSaturday noon, December 12, a showery day, the streets deep with mud and\r\nfilth. Early Sunday morning we were off by rail for Cairo, where we\r\njoined the main body, awaiting our arrival, and I had time for the\r\nEnglish service in the afternoon, a bare dozen of people; but Mrs. L.\r\nsaid the congregation was very much larger in the morning. Monday to\r\nFriday we lived “Arabian Nights” in Cairo. If I let my pen run on my\r\nstory might be only shorter than the thousand and one of the volume\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, all being ready, we took to our boats, in which we have now\r\nbeen domiciled so long, seemingly, that events of October and November\r\nin England are dimly remembered, as if they belonged to another\r\n“dynasty.” There are nine of us, in two boats. The first and larger one,\r\nin which our table is spread, the Ibis, accommodates all the ladies and\r\nmyself, the only married man of the company.... The bow is occupied by\r\nthe crew, and at the very prow a simple cooking-affair, from which\r\nexcellent dinners of four courses, breakfasts, etc., are produced in\r\nsome wonderful way by our Arab cook and his assistant. The smaller boat,\r\nthe Undine, gives ample quarters to the three single men, also our\r\ndragoman, the younger Sapienza, a Maltese, whose time, however, is\r\nmostly passed on our boat.\r\n\r\nAn independent party, but arranged to keep in company, consists of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Howland of New York, very nice people, with their servant and\r\ndragoman, in the Heron. But I must cut short these details, or I shall\r\nnever come to an end. On Friday and Saturday the wind was dead ahead,\r\nand, tracking being impossible until we get out of Cairo, we were\r\nstationary, and on Saturday some of us visited the interesting museum at\r\nBoulak, made by Mariette. Sunday, wind still unfavorable, until nearly\r\nsunset, when we got up two or three miles, where we commanded a superb\r\nview. In the morning you preached to the great satisfaction of your\r\ncongregation of eleven, a very appreciating audience. We established a\r\nregular liturgical service. I was installed as curate; but Mrs. Gray\r\nread the first of your university sermons.... Monday and Tuesday, and I\r\nthink Wednesday also, the boat was tracked, and so we made only a few\r\nmiles a day, and some of us were much on shore....\r\n\r\nThis [the temple of Abydos] was the first Egyptian structure of any\r\nconsequence I had ever seen, and it is very impressive. Most of the\r\nroofing remains, and having been exhumed, for the greater part, within a\r\nvery few years, the colored sculptures covering the walls are very\r\nperfect and fresh. They are in the best style, of the same age as those\r\nin the great temple at Thebes, which we have yet to see.\r\n\r\nYesterday we sailed along slowly, to-day still more so, luxuriating in\r\nthis January weather, which is like our June at home, without any of its\r\nfitfulness. To-day we had full service, and I read your second\r\nuniversity sermon, which all liked very much indeed, and have bespoken\r\nthe third for next Sunday. Your audience consists of eight Unitarians\r\nand three Orthodox Presbyterians. By the way I was much gratified with\r\nthe appreciative review of your sermons in the “Spectator,” in a number\r\nwhich I received at Alexandria. Thanks for the other papers you\r\nforwarded also. I think only letters are awaiting us at Thebes (Luxor),\r\nbut Mr. Hale may send up papers by private opportunity. The mails taken\r\nby runners carry only letters. Our latest intelligence from the Western\r\nWorld is barely up to the formation of Gladstone’s ministry. I shall\r\nhave a deal to read up. But here our days pass on with scarce a thought\r\nof the modern and western world, except on Christmas and New Year’s\r\ndays. I wish I could give you some idea of our life here, and of all we\r\nsee and enjoy, but you must imagine it. We are well supplied with books,\r\nespecially relative to Egypt, are busy from morn to night in a leisurely\r\nway, and are intensely comfortable....\r\n\r\nWe had yesterday for Dendera, where the temple, as to structure, is in\r\nmost complete preservation, but the architecture is of the rather\r\ndebased Ptolemaic period, and the sculptures on the walls, never equal,\r\nI imagine, to those at Abydos, have been sadly defaced by the early\r\nCoptic Christians. But all was very interesting, and the ladies were all\r\nwith us to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nEvening.--We are lying eight miles below Thebes, which we expect to\r\nreach early to-morrow morning, and to receive and dispatch letters. So I\r\nmust close this. We are writing at nine P.M., with almost all the cabin\r\nwindows open. The day has been like one of July in England,--in one\r\nrespect unusually like, for the sky has been overcast with light clouds,\r\nand the air sultry, ending as such a day might with a sudden and brief\r\nstorm--of wind only, though it seemed about to rain; but it is now\r\nstill, and the stars are shining out of a clear sky.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nNUBIA, BELOW DERR, January 21, 1869.\r\n\r\nLet me begin a line to you from this Æthiopian region. The object is to\r\ninclose to you some fresh seeds of Ficus sycomorus, the true sycamore or\r\nfool fig,--not bad to eat. They were gathered at the first cataract of\r\nthe Nile, at ancient Syene, or between it and Philæ. I think you may\r\nlike to send a part to Don José, for culture in Cuba, where it will be a\r\ngood thing to have. And the rest, let Guerrineau try to raise some, that\r\nwe may have one in the conservatory. I shall send, along with heavy\r\nthings, some nuts of the Doum palm, Hyphæne Thebaica, which branches and\r\nis picturesque. That and the date palm are the principal trees here.\r\nBesides, there is Acacia Nilotica (the sont) and one or two other\r\nacacias, and an occasional sycamore. Below, a jujube tree was not\r\nuncommon, and plenty of the fine Acacia (or Albizzia) Lebbek, with its\r\ngreat flat pods and large leaflets. But none in Nubia. Up here the\r\ncultivable valley of the Nile is just the slope of the banks bared as\r\nthe river subsides after the inundation, making a strip of green crops\r\nfrom five feet to five rods wide,--all else desert, either rock or sand\r\nas the case may be. We came twenty-four hours ago within the tropics,--a\r\nnew thing for me, and I thought of Cuba and you. But it is just\r\ncomfortably warm, 70° in the shade as I write,--has been 76°,--the\r\nnights down to 60° or so; just nice and comfortable if you keep out of\r\nthe sun, which, though seemingly not hot, has an overpowering effect I\r\nnever knew at home. Our winds are steady from north and northwest,\r\npushing us up the river steadily. About sixty miles more, or may be\r\nseventy, is the second cataract, and our limit. Then we turn our faces\r\nnorth again, and descend, making our principal stops by the way. For\r\nthus far, we have stopped only little or briefly, taking only such\r\nsight-seeing as came in our way or took us little out of it. Yet we have\r\nhad a glance at several of the greatest things. Abou-Simbel--the great\r\nrock temples of this region, and the main thing to go up into Nubia\r\nfor--we hope to reach to-morrow or day after. We should have been there\r\nnow, but were delayed at Assouan by long negotiations before we could\r\nget put up the Cataracts, and afterwards lost forty-eight hours by\r\nbreaking the rudder of our larger boat. No letters till we get back to\r\nThebes (Luxor)--some weeks hence. There I trust there is something from\r\nyou....\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1869.\r\n\r\n... At Luxor, on our way up, we stopped only half a day, and took our\r\nfirst view of the great temple at Karnak. Left on the morning of January\r\n8; reached Esneh, the capital of Upper Nubia, in early morning of the\r\n10th. Sunday, passed the day and night there. The Ptolemaic temple, or\r\nrather the first court of it, very perfect and thoroughly cleared out\r\nwithin, the columns especially beautiful and all perfect. January 12,\r\nhaving sailed past Silsilis quarries, etc., by night, reached Assouan\r\nbefore noon. Here we reached the granite rocks and the basalt, and the\r\nnext day visited the quarries whence the obelisks and all the great\r\nshafts, blocks, sarcophagi, granite colossi, etc., have been taken\r\nduring several thousand years, the last almost two thousand years ago;\r\nand here are the chisel-marks and places cut to receive the wedges as\r\nsharp and fresh as if the workmen had only just left off work. Of course\r\nwe viewed the obelisk left in the rough, only partly detached. We were\r\nmoored right opposite Elephantiné, and during the two or three days’\r\ndelay before we could arrange to be taken up the cataracts, or secure\r\nfitting weather, the excursion up to Philæ was made by most of the\r\nparty, on camels or donkeys (I greatly prefer the latter), and the very\r\npicturesque scenery enjoyed.\r\n\r\nJanuary 16 and 17 were grand days, going up the cataracts, our boats in\r\ncharge of the Nubians. The first day, Saturday, sailed up to the rapids\r\nand were drawn up the first severe one,--a hard pull and barely room to\r\nget our larger boat through; 17th, a quiet Sunday, in still water\r\nbetween upper and lower rapids; under most picturesque surroundings of\r\nriver, rock, and desert, here strangely mingled, and a hot cloudless\r\nsun; had service and much enjoyed Church’s sermon No. 3. Climbing one of\r\nthe rugged masses of rock toward sunset, had a fine distant view of\r\nlovely Philæ. Monday, 18th, the army of Nubians again took hold of our\r\nboats, and with noises indescribable and persevering efforts the boats\r\nwere drawn, one by one, up the final and worst fall; we were in calm\r\nwater before sunset, and at dusk were moored close to Philæ, which we\r\ngot charming views of, from the opposite shore next morning at sunrise;\r\ncame up and made a brief visit to the ruins after breakfast, and sailed\r\non with a beautiful breeze, when suddenly, about twenty miles on, the\r\nrudder of the Ibis gave way (injured probably in the cataracts), and for\r\nforty-eight hours we lay by near a Nubian hamlet (climbed the mountains\r\non Arabian side; got wonderful views of desert, rock on this side,\r\nreddish-yellow sand on the other), while Antonio, the dragoman, with\r\nrowboat went back to Philæ, and thence by land to Assouan, whence on\r\ncamel brought up new rudder-post, workmen, etc., reinstated the rudder,\r\nand--January 21, afternoon--we were off again.\r\n\r\nNubia is very different from Egypt, picturesque rocky ranges always near\r\nthe river and broken into peaks and pyramids, and all desert except the\r\nnarrow selvage reclaimed by irrigation with sakias; here the vegetation\r\n(barley, peas, beans, and lupines) intensely green by the contrast with\r\nyellow sand or light brown sandstone.\r\n\r\nJanuary 23, before reaching Korosko (whence caravans to Dongola; visited\r\ntheir camps, very wild Arabs and blacks, and very disagreeable white\r\ntraders, Greeks, probably, with villainous faces) saw our first\r\ncrocodile, and sent two shots at once at him, but the huge fellow\r\nflounced off the sand bank into the river, probably not much hurt.\r\n\r\nJanuary 24, first met with chameleons; got three or four from the boys,\r\nbut finally kept only one, which we still have here at Cairo--a lovely\r\nlittle brute whose name is Billy, and a great pet; a great diversion to\r\nwatch his change of hues, and especially to see him catch flies by\r\ndarting out his slender, india-rubber-like tongue to the length of\r\nseveral inches (nearly that of his whole body when the fly was far\r\nenough off), and with wonderful quickness and certainty. Service in the\r\nafternoon, with Church’s last sermon, and sorry we were to have reached\r\nthe end of them.\r\n\r\nBut I shall never have done with our journey at this rate, and shall\r\ngive you not the least idea of it after this fashion; how some days we\r\nsailed on with fair winds, which is very cheerful; some we tracked, and\r\nthen we were much on shore and mingled with the people; and often strong\r\nhead winds kept us fast at the bank, sometimes for two or three days,\r\nwhich grew tedious. Well, on the 27th we came to the great attraction of\r\nthe upper Nile, Abou-Simbel; but the wind being fine and fair, sailed\r\non at a great rate, and reached our terminus, Wady Halfeh, next morning.\r\nMade next day excursion to the farthest point, the high rock Abou Seir,\r\nwhich dominates the second cataracts, and gives extensive view beyond,\r\nfar into Africa; head winds next day kept us at the village, which we\r\nexplored and exchanged hospitalities with the inhabitants, the poorer\r\npart of which were beginning to suffer from famine. Later, going down,\r\nwe met boat loads of corn for seed and food going up from the viceroy\r\nfor their relief; little enough to do for a people so cruelly oppressed\r\nand peeled as the fellahs are. At evening we could be off, the great\r\nyard and sail now down, and small mizzen in its place, to use on the\r\nrare occasion of a south wind, and now we depend upon the current and\r\noars, five on each side, handled by our stalwart crew, their strokes\r\ntimed by queer Arabic chants; more severe labor than in ascending\r\n(except when tracking) and not so pleasant to us as sailing; but yet we\r\ncould come down much faster than we came up. Whenever there was\r\nsight-seeing by day the crews would usually row all night, so we got on\r\nfinely.\r\n\r\nMESSINA, March 24.\r\n\r\nBehold us so far back towards Europe. Here, kept in by that strange\r\nthing in our experience, a rainy day, and prevented thereby from going\r\nto Taormina (Tauromenium) to see the Greek theatre, the site of Naxos,\r\nand a near view of Etna, I resume my writing; which was interrupted a\r\nweek ago by multifarious things at Cairo.... I think I must go back to\r\nthe diary, and so try to tell you, in this mechanical sort of way,\r\nsomewhat of our occupation day by day. The bare names of the places must\r\nconvey to you all I can hope to of our seeings and doings.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1.--Reached Abou Simbel at daybreak, and were under the great\r\ngiant Rameses when the first rays of the sun touched their huge, placid\r\nfaces, and were in the rock temple within when the horizontal rays\r\nentering the small opening for a half hour lighted up the great Osiride\r\nfigures to best advantage, and even reached the broken statues at the\r\nbottom of the adytum. Later in the day explored leisurely and repeatedly\r\nthe whole interior chambers with candles, and occasionally with Bengal\r\nlights and magnesium wire (the best of all lights), bringing out well\r\nthe famous sculptures that cover all the walls. Climbed the heights\r\nlater in the day to get superb views of desert and river and the sunset.\r\nLate in evening some went again through the sand to see the great faces\r\nby moonlight, which, however, they supplemented by torches. We were\r\nmoored right under the face of the smaller rock temple....\r\n\r\nFebruary 9.--Awoke at Philæ; of which I will only say that even Miss\r\nMartineau does not exaggerate the interest of the whole, and the beauty\r\nand picturesqueness of the site.\r\n\r\nFebruary 10.--All day at Philæ, and dropped down to Mahatta just as the\r\nsun set gloriously behind the ruins and the mighty rocks which surround\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFebruary 11.--The Ibis shot the great cataract, all but one of our party\r\nbeing on the shore to see the exciting sight,--finer, it is thought,\r\nthan being on board, though you thus lose the sense of personal danger.\r\nWe were taken on shore round the trying points, and in our rowboats the\r\nrest of the way down to Assouan, where we joined the Ibis, vociferously\r\nwelcomed by our combined Egyptian and Nubian crews, all rejoicing, as\r\nthey well might, in the safety of the Ibis, which had never done the\r\nfeat before and was reckoned rather large for the undertaking. Shopping,\r\netc., filled the day. At evening some of us called on Lady Duff-Gordon,\r\nliving on her boat, now lying here. I went back later and passed an hour\r\nmore with her, taking her some books we could spare her. Much pleased\r\nwith her spirit and affability, but distressed at the progress disease\r\nis making; do not think she can last much longer, even in Egypt. Her\r\nlast year’s visit to Syria injured her seriously.\r\n\r\nFebruary 12.--The Undine came down famously at sunrise, and joined us\r\nsoon opposite the upper end of Elephantiné, where we went up to meet\r\nher, expecting to round the island and be off at once down the river.\r\nBut a heavy blow from the north, and consequent great discouragement; we\r\nhad to lay by all day, not even getting on shore with any comfort, and\r\nalmost all night.\r\n\r\nYou must know that in Upper Egypt and Nubia a hakim or doctor is a great\r\ngodsend to the people, and you have to give medicine all day long. On\r\nreturning to Assouan I was met, when I stepped on shore, by the beaming\r\ndark countenance of a papa, to whose son, whom I thought rather far\r\ngone, I had given some medicine when going up; he had now brought down\r\nthe fellow from a village several miles off, to show me how well--or\r\nnearly well--he was. Another widely grinning face met me, of a papa who\r\nhad brought me his boy with a dreadfully ill-looking sore head, which I\r\nhad dosed with mercurial ointment rubbed in with colza oil. He did not\r\nnow bring the lad, but came a good distance to recall him to my\r\nrecollection by expressive pantomime, and to say in the same way that\r\nhe was “all right.” Eye-wash I dispensed in profuse abundance; and among\r\nthe men cured several cases of ophthalmia which looked serious; and many\r\na petty surgical operation did the “Hakim-Pacha”--as he came to be\r\ncalled--perform. I cannot tell you how much attached we got to our crews\r\nand their officers, and before we parted I made sure that many tears\r\nshould flow in my behalf, by acceding to requests for eye-lotions, which\r\nwere most copiously used,--by those who needed it, for cure, by those\r\nwho did not, for prevention. Two sorts of creatures with which I\r\nformerly had little sympathy, I have learned to appreciate and\r\nrespect,--donkeys and people of color, Arabs and Nubians especially. All\r\nidea of anything disagreeable or inferior in color of skin disappeared,\r\nor rather the darker fellows seemed the finer. As I remember sundry dark\r\nArabs, they seem to me among the best-looking and best-behaved men I\r\never knew. But this digression will never do.... At sunset reached\r\nEdfou.\r\n\r\nFebruary 15.--Whole day at the temple, which is all but entire, and\r\nlarge as well as complete, and the acres of sculpture and hieroglyph in\r\nexcellent preservation, all recently excavated under the care of\r\nMariette and placed under a custodian. If I could be dropped down in\r\nEgypt for one morning only, to see only one thing, it should be this\r\ntemple at Edfou, though only of Ptolemaic date. I cannot stop for a\r\nsingle detail about it....\r\n\r\nFebruary 22.--Luxor: across river, tombs, Medinet el Bahree, Ramaseum,\r\nagain, etc. I and some others dined in the evening on boat with our\r\nEnglish friends (Legge, Eaton, and Baird), and celebrated Washington’s\r\nBirthday.\r\n\r\nFebruary 23.--Boats dropped down to Karnak, had afternoon at the great\r\ntemple, tea there at dusk,--a famous tea-party in the great hall of\r\ncolumns, all the dignitaries at Luxor and Karnak invited; the full\r\nmoonlight enjoyed for an hour or two, and then illumination with Bengal\r\nlights, making splendid effects among the 137 columns, and other parts;\r\nthen rockets; some of our parties back to boat, the rest to a feast\r\ngiven by a splendid old Arab, the chief of Karnak, in full Arab style,\r\nwith music, dancing-women, and all. Imaun Joseph, who had been our guest\r\nat the temple tea, was his relative’s guest at this banquet. Lady\r\nDuff-Gordon’s account of him had made him known to us most favorably,\r\nand we got most thoroughly attached to the man, especially after having\r\nhim to dine with us next day, his smile, voice, and manners of the\r\nsweetest, and his character is every way lovely. He is as dark-skinned\r\nas most American negroes, but with very handsome features. All these\r\nexperiences cannot be written, but could be talked over at large. That\r\nevening view of Karnak is the one I want to keep, so I did not go again;\r\nMrs. G. did once more.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24.--Tombs of the kings; a grand but fatiguing day, most of the\r\ntime in Belzoni’s, the finest and largest; most of us did two or three\r\nmore. I came home over the mountains to get the fine view over the\r\nvalley, etc....\r\n\r\nMarch 4.--Siout: ascended the hill for the great view, from mouth of one\r\nof the great old tombs; shopped in the pretty town; accepted the\r\nAmerican consul’s great attentions for the morning only (rich Coptic\r\nChristian family), but tore ourselves away from entreaties to stay for\r\ndinner and fantasia in the evening, in honor of the inauguration of the\r\nAmerican President, so secured the good wind and were off in the\r\nafternoon....\r\n\r\nMarch 9.--Went over the site of Memphis; saw the colossal figure of\r\nRameses lying pathetically on his face, pyramids of Sakkara, Serapeum,\r\nthe wonderful Apis sarcophagi, and finally that newly excavated,\r\nbeautiful tomb structure, of date very early in old empire (fourth or\r\nfifth dynasty), with paintings and low reliefs with truthfulness,\r\nspirit, taste, and fineness of execution, much surpassing the best days\r\nof the later empire, and all free of the grotesque mythology of later\r\ntimes. A fine treat to come at the last.\r\n\r\nMarch 10.--Hard rowing against wind to reach Gizeh; went in carriages,\r\nby road made for the Prince of Wales, to the Great Pyramid and its\r\nfellow. I went in, but no one ascended,--too much wind; Sphinx,\r\nneighboring old tombs, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nMarch 11.--Cairo: packed and left the boats so long our home, and\r\ngood-by to the sailors.\r\n\r\nMarch 12-18.--Cairo: must not forget one day passed at Mariette’s\r\nmuseum, studying specially the fine things of old empire which he has\r\ndiscovered and rescued. Had fairly enough of mosques, Moslem tombs,\r\nmodern palaces, etc. Sorry that slight illness cut off several things,\r\nnotably a drive to the site of Heliopolis, marked only by a single\r\nobelisk. Steamer from Alexandria would not wait, so we must needs hurry\r\noff, our pleasant party break up, etc.\r\n\r\nMarch 19.--A morning drive at Alexandria, to see Pompey’s Pillar, the\r\nObelisk, etc., and so on board the Peluze; a beautiful evening, but\r\nblowy weather followed,--a seasick time; and here we got, not Monday\r\nevening, but Tuesday morning, boat gone to Naples the day before....\r\nMrs. G. badly knocked up, and here is cold spring weather and fickle,\r\nweeping skies, so unlike the thoroughly reliable weather which we had\r\ngot to regard as a law of nature; wherefore such freaks take us all by\r\nsurprise. Oh, how we long already for the dry air and certain sky of old\r\nEgypt!...\r\n\r\nTAORMINA, March 25, evening.\r\n\r\nWe have done it, after all, or at least are in the way of doing it....\r\nThis morning, when the sea looked rough with the recent gales, although\r\nthe very low barometer began to rise, I was not sorry when the Florio\r\nsteamer was kept back, waiting an overdue corresponding vessel from\r\nMalta, and, though announced to sail to-morrow, I determined to wait yet\r\nlonger for smoother weather. Meanwhile it cleared off beautifully,\r\nthough with considerable wind. At four P.M. this afternoon we were off\r\nby rail with small luggage needful, on the Catania railroad; an hour and\r\na half along a coast more picturesque than the finest parts of the\r\nCorniche road, though not so grand, brought us to Giardini; whence an\r\nascent of an hour up a zigzag road in a one-horse carriage, commanding\r\ncharming sunset views all the way, old Etna full in view southwest,\r\nbrought us to this queer perch. It reminds us of Turbia, but is far more\r\nstriking. We are in a primitive, but very nice auberge; our window\r\nlooking full upon the whole mass of Etna glistening in the clear\r\nmoonlight. On the left hand we look directly down upon the sea and along\r\nthe jagged coast; on the right Taormina Castle overhangs us almost, the\r\nold castle or forts covering its narrow summit, probably 1,000 feet\r\nabove us; it must command an extraordinary view. We shall see to-morrow.\r\nRather behind us lies the amphitheatre, on a craggy buttress between us\r\nand the sea.\r\n\r\nMorning; up at daylight, to the amphitheatre, to see sun rise out of the\r\nsea and light up Etna, which was without a cloud. The theatre really a\r\nRoman ruin, with bits only of the original Greek; the situation\r\nsuperb.... I climb up to Mola, get a grand study of Etna from height of\r\n1,500-2,000 feet, the clouds keeping off till I had done. Extensive sea\r\nand coast view, but haze in the far distance. Descended on to the peak\r\nbearing the Saracenic ruins of the Castle of Taormina, overhanging the\r\ntown; and now, having dined, and found Mrs. G. better, as well as\r\ndesirous of warmer quarters, we are soon to descend to the shore below\r\nus, and take train for Catania. This place is very well worth visiting,\r\nand I am glad that I arranged as I did, only sorry that I had to enjoy\r\nmost of it alone.\r\n\r\nNAPLES, Tuesday, 30th.\r\n\r\nFound Catania well worth a visit; had pleasant Easter Sunday, and superb\r\nview of Etna, and of its various former doings, sending its lavas down\r\nto the sea in a tremendous way. Getting back to Messina, the steamer, a\r\nlittle one, was off Monday afternoon; good parting views of Etna toward\r\nevening; an uncomfortable night; we entered the bay at daybreak, and\r\nNaples soon after sunrise, and are now domiciled in full view of\r\nVesuvius.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nROME, April 22, 1869.\r\n\r\n... I am thirsty for botanical news, after having laid aside the\r\nbotanist for a much longer time than ever before. Well, we were three\r\nand a half months in Egypt, three months of it on the Nile itself, and\r\nwe have avoided the chills of winter and had a season of great enjoyment\r\nand interest. I passed your friend Professor Marcet in Nubia, but missed\r\nvisiting his boat, from his sailing under the English flag, but hit upon\r\nthat of Mr. Naville,[76] whom we saw afterwards at Edfou, and were much\r\npleased with.\r\n\r\nBotany on the Nile is nearly _nil_, yet I collected a small suite of\r\nspecimens, as souvenirs. Returning, we had a most uncomfortable passage\r\nto Messina.... In Naples and in the charming environs we passed a\r\nfortnight and rather more, and have now had a week in Rome.\r\n\r\nWe are just now recovering the mild and charming weather which we left\r\nbehind in Egypt. We shall stay here, I suppose, only ten days more, make\r\na short stay in Florence, also in Venice, visit the Italian lakes, and,\r\nI think, go to Vienna by way of Innsbruck, to be there the first week in\r\nJune. All else is uncertain, except that we mean to be in Switzerland in\r\nJuly....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray said he found more botany in a half day in the desert than in a\r\nweek in Egypt! A country cultivated for five thousand years had no\r\nweeds. There were long walks and occasional excursions in Nubia into the\r\ndesert when the dahabeah was lying still.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, June 8, 1869.\r\n\r\n... It is hurrying and distracting work, this traveling with a pair of\r\nnice young ladies, sharp for sight-seeing, ... and a lot of botanists\r\nand gardens, etc., you want to see on your own hook. So you will excuse\r\nall curtness in letters....\r\n\r\nAt Munich we saw, of course, much of Madame de Martius,[77]--a sweet,\r\ngood soul, deeply grieved by the loss of her husband, and yet bears up\r\nbravely. And we learned many interesting things about good Martius.\r\nNotices of Martius’ death were sent, as usual, to all friends....\r\n\r\n11th. Nuremberg is a queer old place indeed. We have nearly twenty-four\r\nhours here, and go on the way to Dresden to-day.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nDRESDEN, June 13, 1869.\r\n\r\nI’ll tell you what our plans are at present. To stay here till Friday\r\nnoon, the 18th; Mrs. G. to be very quiet, as she cares mainly to see the\r\ngallery and enjoy it leisurely. On Tuesday, I, with the young ladies, go\r\nup to Freiberg to visit the celebrated mining school, etc., and on\r\nreturn next day, to see the Forst-Akademie at Tharand. Friday night all\r\nto Töplitz, to pass two days with a friend,--the Sunday’s rest. Monday\r\nto Prague, Tuesday to Regensburg, Wednesday or Thursday to Munich, and\r\nSaturday evening to be at Ragatz (or Pfeffers). Soon after at least Mrs.\r\nG. and I will be settled for a while at Geneva.\r\n\r\nHÔTEL BYRON, VILLENEUVE, July 15, 1869.\r\n\r\n... Boissier has been seriously sick with a pleurisy, etc.; is at Orbe,\r\nor was. If still there I should go to see him; but he has now gone to\r\nGries, in Appenzell, to a bathing-place, and I shall not see him....\r\nReuter, his curator, was away last week, but I shall see him, I presume,\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have just lost my mother, at a good old age. My father died\r\ntwenty-four years earlier....\r\n\r\nIt is a charming place here. We are spending the morning lazily, and go\r\non soon to Geneva. The young people have gone on to Chamouni, which we\r\ndo not care to revisit.... Kindest regards to Professor Fenzl, with\r\nregrets that I shall not see him.\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH HOWLAND.\r\n\r\nINTERLAKEN, July 26, 1869.\r\n\r\n... We have had a joyful time in Switzerland, and for me a complete\r\nrejuvenation. And as to Mrs. Gray, who did not need that, what we call\r\n“the movement cure” has done her more good than all Egypt. That my\r\nlamentable failure of breath on Piz Langarde was owing, not to advancing\r\nyears, as I had foreboded, nor wholly to the rarefaction of the\r\natmosphere above 9,000 feet, as Mrs. H. suggested, but to a violent\r\ncold, then impending, I proved satisfactorily by walking the other day\r\ndown from Mürren to Lauterbrunnen (having walked up the eve before), and\r\nthen right on over the Wengern Alp to Grindelwald, and I believe as\r\ncomfortably as I did it (all but the first part) thirty, and then\r\nnineteen, years ago!\r\n\r\nWeather has been all we could ask for,--this the first rainy day to keep\r\nus indoors, and it now promises to be pleasant by noon, so that we can\r\ngo to Giessbach. Let me tell you what we have done....\r\n\r\nWife and I started Thursday, to Sierre, by rail. Friday, carriage to\r\nVisp, and horses to St. Nicolaus. Saturday, char-à-banc to Zermatt, and\r\nhorses to hotel on the Riffel. Only my wife’s own pen can relate how\r\nshe felt in flesh, bones, and spirit after that, nor her surprise to\r\nfind next morning that she was “alive, and alive like to be,” nor her\r\nkeen delight in Matterhorn, Monte Rosa, and surroundings, and the\r\nprofusion of alpine flowers. Sunday and Monday on Riffel most enjoyable.\r\nTuesday, Mrs. G., thinking _facile descensus_ inapplicable to such a\r\nsteep path, insisted upon walking down to Zermatt, which she did; a long\r\nrest at Zermatt, with pleasant English friends, and a dinner enabled us\r\nto go in char to St. Nicolaus to sleep, taking a small thunder-shower in\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nWednesday, “we still live,” and go on horses, through two showers, to\r\nVisp again, and then carriage to Sierre and rail down to Hôtel Byron, to\r\nget charming view and sleep.\r\n\r\nThursday, all fresh comparatively, and go in a chaise to Chillon, and\r\nthen back to our pleasant quarters in Hôtel de la Metropole, Geneva.\r\nHere we rest, see friends, and do botany till Tuesday last.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nLONDON, August 22, 1869.\r\n\r\n... With all my endeavors I could not get off a note to you by\r\nyesterday’s (Saturday’s) post, and so shall be late in announcing to you\r\nour prosperous return to England. We left Paris on Thursday, reached\r\nAmiens in time to visit the cathedral, a most striking specimen of\r\nfullest-flowered Gothic, saw it again on Friday morning, and, after a\r\nsmooth crossing, got to London before sunset. Yesterday I had to go to\r\nthe banker’s, to Kew, and to see our Harvard men at Putney.[78] I must\r\nnow needs be with them on their trial day; and then, tell me frankly if\r\nit would perfectly suit Mrs. Church and yourself if we came to you on\r\nSaturday (28th) for a few days. Later would serve us, if you prefer....\r\n\r\nAfter that I hope we can get settled at Kew, and do some work, for which\r\nI have little enough time left.\r\n\r\nAs to Exeter meeting of British Association, I am on the whole glad\r\nenough to keep away, especially from Darwinian discussions, in which I\r\ndesire not to be at all “mixed up” with the prevailing and peculiarly\r\nEnglish materialistic, positivic line of thought, with which I have no\r\nsympathy, while in natural history I am a sort of Darwinian.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nKEW, [CHARLTON HOUSE], September 20, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe skies were propitious to us in Switzerland, and the only very warm\r\nday was the one which we passed, very pleasantly indeed, with Godet at\r\nNeufchâtel. Thence we went to Paris, stopping at Dijon en route....\r\n\r\nOliver and Baker are here steadily at work. Dr. Masters[79] drops in now\r\nand then. Dr. Hooker, after some respite, was at home. Dr. Thomson\r\nreturned last week; and now Bentham is here also, fresh from the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nAt British Museum I find Dr. Carruthers[80] and the new assistant, Dr.\r\nTrimen. Mr. Bennett still, I think, away on his holiday. Botanical and\r\nother news I have none. I send you this mere apology for a letter, in\r\nthe hope of getting something from you; and later I may have more to\r\nsay. Can I be of any use to you here?\r\n\r\nRemember me kindly to Dr. Müller,[81] to whom best thanks for all the\r\nfriendly services which he has rendered me.\r\n\r\nOur united kind regards to Madame De Candolle, and to your son (from\r\nwhom I still expect a photograph), and my wife’s to yourself. We have\r\nthe most pleasant recollections of our brief visit to Geneva.\r\n\r\nBelieve me ever your devoted\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL HOWLAND.\r\n\r\nKEW, October 3, 1869.\r\n\r\nI don’t know when you would get a response to your welcome letter of\r\nAugust 22, which reached us here in due course, so long as things went\r\non in the ordinary way,--I working at botany as much as possible, but\r\npresiding here over a considerable household, some sight-seeing and much\r\nintermittent visiting. But now that I am all alone, and my wife with the\r\nrest of them _girareing_ over the north of England, sober reflection has\r\nits hour, and I remember the friends that are far away, perhaps on the\r\nshores of Italian lakes, and long to know how they get on and what they\r\nare about. To attain which knowledge and put myself _en rapport_ I\r\nshould first, I know, give you some account of ourselves and our doings.\r\n\r\nBut where to begin? I think we wrote you from Paris. We had three weeks\r\nthere, I mostly at the Jardin des Plantes till near dinner-time....\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, after cool weather in Paris we came in for a piece of\r\nvery sultry weather in London, where we had to stay awhile, our lodgings\r\nhere not being available till about 15th September. So after staying to\r\nthe Harvard boat-race,--which I saw from the umpire’s boat, and Mrs.\r\nGray, with good Miss S., from some grounds above Fulham,--we set off on\r\na little round of visits, first to the Darwins’, near Bromley, then to\r\nthe Churches’ in Somersetshire, a pleasant country rectory and a\r\ndelightful couple. You remember the university sermons we had up the\r\nNile were his. Next we passed a day with an old bachelor botanical\r\nacquaintance near Taunton, who makes a capital squire; then to Torquay\r\nfor three days (with a daughter of Sir William Hooker, and her husband,\r\nDr. Lombe), one of which I devoted to an excursion down the river Dart\r\nfrom Totness to Dartmouth (which the English think much of, but you\r\ndwellers on the Hudson would not), and to a view of that quaint little\r\ntown. On our way back we had an hour at Exeter to see the cathedral; a\r\nnight and morning at Salisbury, the cathedral as to exterior, site, and\r\nall, and beautiful spire, one of the most satisfactory in England; took\r\na glance at Wilton, a peep into old George Herbert’s little church of\r\nBemerton and into his house and garden; stopped over a train at Romsey\r\nto see the fine Norman abbey church, and to Winchester, most interesting\r\ncathedral as to the interior, Winchester school and the old Hospital of\r\nSt. Cross. Then, on returning to London, we settled down here, and after\r\na few days were joined by the rest of our party from France.\r\n\r\n... No one in England recognized me with my venerable white beard!\r\n\r\nEver, dear Howland, your affectionate\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nThe winter Dr. Gray spent in Egypt, in 1869, he raised a full beard,\r\nwhich so changed his appearance that, though eyes and voice were there,\r\nhis oldest friends did not know him on his return, and he had great glee\r\nin imposing himself on his old friend Dr. Torrey, when he went to the\r\nstation to meet him in Boston, as a persistent hack-driver. Even when he\r\ndeclared himself, Dr. Torrey would scarcely believe him; he and\r\nProfessor Henry always maintained a man had no lawful right so to change\r\nhis outward appearance after middle age.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nKEW, October 6, 1869.\r\n\r\n... A week ago Saturday Mrs. G. and I went down via Warwick to\r\nStratford-on-Avon, where we had never been, with Professor Flower,[82]\r\nto visit his father and mother, whose house (almost always thronged by\r\nAmericans), a short mile out of Stratford, commands one of the most\r\ncharming and wholly English views (that of English landscape-painters).\r\nOn Monday morning Loring and the girls, who had passed the Sunday at\r\nWarwick, drove down and took us up, and we saw the Shakespeare\r\nmemorials, even to Anne Hathaway’s cottage (all but myself, who studied\r\nbrewing instead), and back to “The Hill” for a lunch-dinner. Then they\r\ntook my wife and departed to pass night and next day at Warwick. At\r\nevening I went by a direct train to Oxford to sleep, seeing first\r\nProfessor Rolleston[83] for a moment. And, breakfasting with him and\r\nhis agreeable wife next morning early (his windows command a lovely\r\nview), set about seeing all the structures, etc., that have sprung up\r\nsince the almost twenty years that have passed: the Museum and its\r\nworkings, the Ratcliffe turned into an admirable reading-room, chapel of\r\nExeter, also Balliol, new buildings of Christ Church, etc. I did not\r\nfail to look in upon the quadrangle of Oriel, also, to ask for Mr.\r\nBurgon, but he was in France. After lunch I took train, and was in Kew\r\nsoon after sunset. Since then I have been away one day and one night,\r\nwith Mr. Rivers of Orchard-house fame, at Sawbridgeworth, Herts....\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nKEW, October 11, 1869.\r\n\r\nI am now almost through with my examination of the Polemoniaceæ, for\r\nwhich I brought over all mine here. I have got them into good shape,\r\nsettled many things only to be determined here, and have a clear and\r\ndefinite idea as to what I would do with the genera, and have\r\nstraightened out the species.\r\n\r\nOctober 31.\r\n\r\nAfter so long a drought--as happens in some climates--when the change\r\ncomes, you pour refreshingly. But with all your three rapidly following\r\nletters not one of them makes the least reference to my letter, written\r\nfor one special purpose.\r\n\r\nBennett is as pleasant as ever. When I go up next to British Museum I\r\nwill give your regards.\r\n\r\nOld Gray (J. E.), who has ever been particularly kind to us, has had a\r\nparalytic stroke, which, with other infirmities, seemed about to close\r\nhis life. But he is wonderfully rallying....\r\n\r\nHow glad we are about the grandchild, and what real comfort and delight\r\nyou will have with the little fellow! And then the satisfaction of\r\nhaving your name go down in the direct line. Why, he may be a botanist,\r\nor at least a chemist, and add honor to the name in another generation.\r\nPlease give, with our love, our united congratulations to the happy papa\r\nand mamma.\r\n\r\nWe have been corresponding with Carey, and shall see him soon.\r\n\r\nThe sheet is full; so adieu for a few weeks. Ever your affectionate\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nQUEEN’S HOTEL, LIVERPOOL, November 8, 1869.\r\n\r\nWe broke up our establishment at Kew, this afternoon, and are having the\r\nnight here, preparatory to embarkation. Before leaving Kew I received\r\nthe proof of your sermon,[84] and here I found your last note, and\r\nLoring another proof-copy of the sermon; for which he sends best thanks.\r\n\r\nSo you have been again to Windsor, and this time, I trust, had her\r\nMajesty in the congregation....\r\n\r\nLoring, the young ladies, and myself had the Sunday at Canterbury, our\r\nlast cathedral, and a most interesting one, both in the sight and the\r\nassociations. We have Stanley’s “Memorials” to read up, with other\r\nthings, on the voyage, if the Atlantic will allow it.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning.--Off Irish coast; shall reach Queenstown before\r\nnoon; very smooth water, especially since we were out of the St.\r\nGeorge’s Channel. We are all doing very well, though some of our party,\r\nincluding Mrs. Gray, are poor creatures on the water.\r\n\r\nI have read over the sermon with real interest. What I much like in it\r\nis the broadness of view and moderation of claim, which adds strength to\r\nthe argument. It seems to me that every Christian man, churchman or no,\r\nwould yield full assent to all you say.\r\n\r\nAnd, dear Mr. Church, consider that all your friends think, no doubt, as\r\nI do, that you are hardly at liberty to take counsel of your misgivings\r\nand humility, if asked to take some position in which your gifts may\r\ntell more directly upon educated men, especially the younger men. I\r\ndon’t want to see you in a position which brings cares and anxieties\r\nalong with high honors; these I do not covet for you in the least. What\r\nI covet for you is fruitful leisure, some position for you which, while\r\nit gives you time, and income enough to supply real wants, makes also\r\nsome demands; for rarely does one do anything to much purpose that he is\r\nnot somehow constrained to do.\r\n\r\nWe leave behind us in England most delightful friends, and we are not\r\nlikely to forget them; but we are somehow drawn to you in a peculiar\r\nway, and shall often be thinking of you and yours when settled down\r\nagain, if it please God that we may be, at our pleasant home on the\r\nother side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, MASS., November 23, 1869.\r\n\r\nJust a line to tell you--which you will be glad to know--that we safely\r\naccomplished our voyage home, landing yesterday morning [Monday] early,\r\non the thirteenth day. Very well for that vessel, the slowest of the\r\nline, and at this season, with much head wind. No gales, but some stiff\r\nbreezes, and the vessel tumbled and rolled about, to our discomfort.\r\nHowever, it is all over; and Mrs. G. and the other ladies, who suffered\r\na good deal, are looking brighter again.\r\n\r\nMy wife sends kind love to you and all yours, and the young people, if\r\nthey knew of my writing, would send kind and grateful messages. The\r\nvoyage now seems to me only as a disturbed night’s sleep, dozing off in\r\nOld England to awake in the New.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 14, 1870.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--Being eve of post-day we respond at once to yours of\r\nthe 27th January--which arrived this very morning--lest you should send\r\nus down to posterity with a fabulous dog-story.\r\n\r\nI well remember telling you of our “Max”[85] and his habit of washing\r\ncat-fashion; which you suggested might have come from being brought up\r\nwith a cat, and I think I told you that I had not been able to learn\r\ndefinitely whether that was the case or no. Here, you see, by some\r\nshuffling of memory, a suggestion of what might explain a fact has taken\r\nthe place of the fact itself. I am curious to know if it be true, for it\r\nis the only explanation I can think of.\r\n\r\nI trust you have some of the slender-leaved Drosera I sent through\r\nHooker.\r\n\r\nWell, our homeward voyage was not a nice one, especially for Mrs. Gray,\r\nand it now seems a long time ago. I dropped at once into a world of\r\nwork; but am not killing myself. The main struggle for existence will\r\ncome in the spring, when my duties crowd on me dreadfully.\r\n\r\nIt gave us both very great pleasure to see again Mrs. Darwin’s\r\nwell-known handwriting, and your signature.\r\n\r\nI knew you would be pleased with young Agassiz and his Yankee wife. I\r\nwish his health were better; and I do hope your own will be such that\r\nyou can next summer see and know my trump of a colleague J. Wyman.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 28, 1870.\r\n\r\n... You hope that I will not resign my chair here unless to devote\r\nmyself wholly to botanical work. What other object could I have in view?\r\nI am not likely to be idle, and I care for nothing else. The difficulty\r\nis, that the university cannot well spare me now, nor find a fit person\r\nto take either the whole or a part of my work, but there is a good\r\ndisposition to favor my views.\r\n\r\nCharles Wright is helping me as curator of the herbarium, and is getting\r\nthe large accessions into it--rather slowly.\r\n\r\nThe winter is nearly passed; I have employed diligently all the time I\r\ncould command, but the net result looks small. All I have for the\r\nprinter is a revision of Eriogoneæ, which I have turned over to him, and\r\nwhich you shall soon see. I think I have done it very well. I have in\r\nEriogonum made use of a character which you have not employed, i. e.,\r\nthe attenuation of the base of the flower into stipes, which marks the\r\numbellata and the eriantha well, and I have increased the number of the\r\nsections. The species I have actually diminished from eighty-one to\r\nseventy-nine, although several had been added to those in the\r\nProdromuses, and I have added half a dozen myself.\r\n\r\nI should have written to you long ago, but as you would always have news\r\nof me through Hooker, and I had nothing special to say, I refrained. It\r\nis always a pleasure to hear from you, and I have no idea that our long\r\ncorrespondence should drop. I should have seen more of you and Mrs.\r\nBentham (and my wife, too, regretted much), but you were much laid up\r\nwith that sciatica, and we were dreadfully pressed at the last. Could we\r\nhave had this winter in England, as we had at first hoped, it would have\r\nbeen well.\r\n\r\nTorrey made me a visit in January; is well and happy, except that he\r\ngets only odds and ends of time for botany, and so cannot do anything to\r\nmuch purpose. The Eriogoneæ being a pet group of his, and his old\r\nsketches very useful in my elaboration, I have joined his name to my own\r\nin the paper I am now printing.\r\n\r\nAt the wonderful rate you are going on you will soon complete the “Flora\r\nAustraliensis.” Happy and fortunate man that you are, both in the\r\nfaculty of accomplishing work and in having your whole time for just\r\nwhat you want to do.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, MASS., U. S., February 15, 1870.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHURCH,--My good wife has just handed me these sheets for Mrs.\r\nChurch, and if it were not just on post-morning I should gossip with\r\nyou, I suppose, to the extent of a sheetful, and send you our hearty\r\nthanks for your most kind and welcome Christmas letter,--the\r\nacknowledgments for which have been deferred too long already.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have had three or four delightful weeks out of our short\r\nwinter vacation, which have been given wholly to botanical work in my\r\nstudy. But this week begins again my round of official duties, to\r\ncontinue till July.\r\n\r\nI rather weary of it as I grow older; and still more I grudge the time.\r\nI could now, I see, make fair arrangement for relinquishing a large part\r\nof my work in the university if there were some one ready to come in as\r\na colleague or suffragan. But the person wanted is not to be found, and\r\nit will take a long while to hatch and raise one. We shall see.\r\n\r\nI keep up all my lively interest in English affairs. But I do not get\r\nthe items of news now as early as I used to do when the “Gardener’s\r\nChronicle” had a news-sheet attached. I do well enough in the scientific\r\nline, however, as I see both “Nature” and the “Academy.” The former\r\nshould bear for its motto “Natura non facit saltum;” it does not jump at\r\nonce to perfection; the articles are many of them rather weak and washy.\r\nThe “Academy” in its way seems better. The “Athenæum” (which I hope will\r\nrevive, now that Dixon is out of it), the “Saturday Review,” and the\r\n“Pall Mall Budget” come to us in our book club, after a while, in our\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nSo Temple, having carried his point, is now making his over-active\r\nopponents look a bit foolish by preaching earnest orthodox sermons. And\r\nGladstone has done a (to me not unexpected) thing which gratifies his\r\nfriends here, in giving to Mr. Fraser the see of Manchester; I had not\r\nheard of the death of the former incumbent when the news of this offer\r\ncame. What a run Gladstone is having in the way of church patronage!\r\nThen the memorial from both universities themselves for the abolition of\r\nreligious tests! How you are getting on! And how are you to manage to\r\nsecure proper religious influence at the universities? By moral power\r\nand the strength of your cause alone? which may, after all, be more\r\ntruly effective than statutes. Yet there will be natural anxieties.\r\n\r\nPray give me, now and then, an inside view of what is going on, or\r\nbetter, what is thought.\r\n\r\nWhy, here is my sheet filled and nothing said. I have nothing to tell\r\nyou from here--nothing worth sending you. I don’t think much of Lowell’s\r\n“Cathedral.” The grotesque bits are not in half as good keeping as the\r\ngargoyles and other queer pieces of ornament on the old cathedrals.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 4, 1870.\r\n\r\nI have for a long while been wishing and endeavoring to write to you,\r\nbut it is not so easy, so many other letters have to be written, to\r\nanswer letters from persons that I don’t particularly care for, as to\r\nleave little time for those that I do.\r\n\r\nI owe you for two very interesting letters; for it was a hurried note of\r\nmine that we need not count, which crossed yours of February 4, and then\r\nthere is your later one of March 1, along with Mrs. Church’s to my wife.\r\nI leave it for her to tell you about the novelists. And I have not much\r\nto say of myself. I have pottered all winter over the herbarium and upon\r\nan article for our “American Academy’s Proceedings,” of a wholly\r\ntechnical nature, which is just in the printer’s hands. I am about to\r\nbegin another,--a study of another group of North American plants; but\r\nthe professional work absorbs so much of my time and energy that it\r\nwill, I know, make no great progress until July brings a long vacation.\r\nAnd then I may have my hands full, somewhat as yours will be,\r\nsuperintending building. I have _my_ church to enlarge. I need a\r\nlecture-room here on the spot, and a students’ laboratory in connection\r\nwith it; and I have a plan for this, to form a wing to the herbarium\r\nbuilding, and a fair prospect that I may get it done. We shall see\r\nbefore long; and if the means are forthcoming, I will soon let you know,\r\nwith all the details....\r\n\r\nThe last “Spectator” received gives an abstract of Gladstone’s and\r\nForster’s Irish Land and Education bills, and of the general favor they\r\nwere received with upon their introduction. To have almost satisfied all\r\nparties and interests is really a wonderful and a most unexpected\r\nachievement. You ought to be proud of Gladstone, and well satisfied at\r\nhaving inevitable and great changes wrought out under so strong a\r\nministry, and so high-minded a leader. Courage, earnestness, and high\r\nprinciple here are seen to command success, in Parliament at least. How\r\nanything will work in Ireland remains to be seen. But don’t think as\r\nsome of my English friends do, that the Irish are incapable of good\r\nthings. The race over here, as a general thing, develop at once what\r\nthey seem to lack at home, thrift, and with thrift come order and\r\nrespect for law.\r\n\r\nI happened to be in Boston on St. Patrick’s Day, and was stopped in my\r\ncarriage while a very long Irish procession passed. They were mainly of\r\nthe more well-to-do sort, no doubt; but they had made themselves so.\r\nProbably nearly every one of middle age was born in Ireland, and would\r\nhave been a peasant laborer at home, very likely ill-conditioned enough.\r\nThey were, however, in holiday attire; still they were fair\r\nrepresentatives of the race, and I wished we could send them over to you\r\nfor a day, as specimens of what may be made out of such material, under\r\ncircumstances, not altogether the best, but much better than those at\r\nhome. They are not the best element of our population, certainly, but\r\nthey make by no means a bad lower stratum, out of which many show a\r\ntruly Yankee-like aptitude for rising. They are almost all Romanists, to\r\nbe sure; and there is an element of danger. But the influence of the\r\npriesthood is much tempered (as witness how they ran into Fenianism,\r\nagainst their exhortations) and in most respects is far from bad. The\r\nGermans are counted as a much better population, but they are quite as\r\nclannish, and in the towns are rather disposed to be actively\r\nanti-Christian.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I met some time ago Mr. Stanley, who has been in the country\r\nbefore; is now on his way round the world via California, a favorite\r\nroute. He is, or was, an M. P., a son of Lord Stanley of Alderley, an\r\nOxford man, bright, sharp, and very talkative. He is a specimen of\r\nultra-secularistic liberalism, I should think, of a set that will be apt\r\nto give you some trouble hereafter, in the questions that are to come\r\nup; if I do not misjudge him, one who thinks the world, or at least\r\nEngland, has not much farther use for distinctive Christianity; just one\r\nof the sort you must have had in view, in yours of February 4, as\r\nextremely generous “in making free with what other people value, and you\r\ndon’t care for.” Most uncivilly, I fear, I fell almost into a wrangle\r\nwith him directly. He even seemed to think us on the whole a bigoted set\r\nhere in Cambridge,--rather a novel view to us....\r\n\r\nWell, I must break off.\r\n\r\nOur spring is tardy, after a wintry March. Only snowdrops yet out in the\r\nGarden, and those in the sunniest place, a lot which I brought with me\r\nfrom England. For primroses we have to look into a cold frame, in which\r\nthey, with violets, have been blossoming all the latter part of the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nNovember 15, 1870.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--Many thanks for your most kind letter of the 24th\r\nOctober. Taken along with one from Mr. Bentham of about the same date,\r\nit gives me tidings of several of our French confrères, who are now in\r\nsuch great tribulation. What a change since last year, since last summer\r\neven; and for Mrs. Gray and me, how fortunate that we had our visit made\r\nand over before the deluge! And what can be the end, and when? It is\r\nuseless to conjecture. And now there is fear that while Germany is\r\nholding the Gallic wolf by the ears,--a situation growing daily more\r\nuncomfortable and dangerous for Prussia, and England is left quite\r\nalone,--Russia is to take a step forward in the Black Sea, etc., which\r\nwill greatly vex England and Austria, and perhaps send the torch of war\r\nall over Europe; and if all closes up soon Europe will feel this\r\npowerful Germany. But it may be the better for Switzerland, whose danger\r\nis always from France. It used to make me uneasy and indignant to see\r\nthe French flag on the shore of your Lake, where it has no business to\r\nbe!\r\n\r\nThe Caruel[86] pamphlet reached me to-day. To the first question the\r\nanswer is simple and easy. About the second, there is perhaps more to be\r\nsaid. As the publication of a name without a character goes for nothing,\r\nwhy should the dubious proposal of a name with a hypothetical character\r\ngo for more? And suppose the suggested character does not prove true,\r\nand a genus afterwards be founded well upon the same species with a good\r\ncharacter, and under another name, must that give place to the\r\nconditional name, etc.? Vain the endeavor to settle every such little\r\nquestion by the terms of any positive enactment.\r\n\r\nOne thing I see, that is, that our solitary point of disagreement will\r\nerelong disappear. The fact of the publication of a certain name, at a\r\ncertain date and a certain place, being the main thing, the form (and I\r\nadd the agent) of publication being a subsidiary consideration, I think\r\nyou will come to agree that, _e. g._, names proposed by Fischer and\r\npublished in his name by De Candolle, must be said to be Fischer’s, and\r\ncited, in the last resort, as, _e. g._, “A. dasyglottis, Fisch. in DC.,”\r\njust as I write “Phlox rigida, Benth. in DC.” For all the rest, I think\r\nI agree with you fully. I perfectly agree that, _e. g._, “Diceratium\r\nLag.” is correct only as a generic name, that “Sect. Diceratium DC.” is\r\nthe only correct way. I myself and others have not followed this proper\r\ncourse always in former times; but should do so hereafter....\r\n\r\nBelieve me to remain as ever, most cordially yours,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 14, 1870.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND: ... I have the hour of leisure and am in the mood for\r\nwriting this evening. The latter I may count on, but the former I\r\ncannot, in these busy and rather distracting days.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday evening last I heard Tom Hughes give a public lecture, the\r\nonly one he gives in America. He manfully stood up and turned the tables\r\nupon us, by insisting that the Americans were wronging the British, by\r\nblaming them when they ought to be praised for their general conduct\r\nduring the war of the Rebellion. His lecture was very able and pleasant;\r\nand he seemed well pleased, as well he might be, at the reception of it.\r\nHe, at least, did excellent service in our behalf, in our times of\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThe next evening I met him at the house of a colleague here in\r\nCambridge, and had a very pleasant talk with him. On telling him that I\r\ncame near to hearing him speak to the electors of Frome, and was\r\nprevented only by the rainy day that made our walk to Longleat too late,\r\nhe spoke of you with much interest, and told me, what I did not know,\r\nthat he was of Oriel while you were tutor. He is very much pleased with\r\nhis trip through the country.\r\n\r\nAs to the Franco-German war, it is thus far a succession of wonders, and\r\nnow when a week passes, like the last, without any astounding event, one\r\nfeels dissatisfied. At first, the crowning and unexpected result, of\r\njudgment overtaking Louis Napoleon here on the spot, was only to be\r\nrejoiced over. And I think you in England must all be glad to see the\r\nvulgar Empire vanish in a day, and in the collapse show how hollow and\r\ngood for nothing it was in what we supposed its strong side, military\r\nforce and military ability. But now, it is painful to see France reduced\r\nto such straits, and I long to see peace made with as little weakening\r\nof France as may be. Only, if it goes on, this chastening, and the\r\neffort it may induce France to make, may regenerate her spirit. But, as\r\nyou say, only the prophetic books of Scripture furnish language in which\r\nto express one’s feelings and sentiments.\r\n\r\n“And then this nation will I judge, saith the Lord”--sounds in your\r\nears, as these vast changes sweep on.\r\n\r\nIf I fail to enter wholly into your feelings as to Bismarck and Prussia,\r\nhere is Mrs. Gray, who has been anti-Prussian from the very first, and\r\nwho shares all your misgivings, and more. Now, I think it a pity, and a\r\nloss to the world, that the German people should be broken up into\r\njealous rival kingdoms and little principalities, always liable to be\r\nplayed off against each other by outlying nations. I think Germany as\r\nsuch ought to take its place as a great Central European power. And yet\r\na simple centralized government is dangerous; at best could ill replace\r\nlocal governments. So I hope for, and expect, a close confederation of\r\nGerman states, in a restored and efficient German empire, the states of\r\nwhich will be as closely united as those of our Federal Union, but yet\r\nsovereignties in all that relates to internal concerns. I don’t despair\r\nof the Germans working out a fairly successful constitutional\r\nparliamentary system, along with state parliaments, etc., after their\r\nown fashion. And I fancy that a united Germany will tend to peace in\r\nEurope, when one section can no more be played off against another.\r\n\r\nBut what sort of a policy is this which Great Britain seems to have been\r\npursuing in weakening, and as if inclined to sever, her connections with\r\nher principal colonies? Why not contrive some mode of uniting home and\r\ncolonial interests, giving the colonies imperial representation, or\r\nsomething of the sort, or somehow be making sure that the men you will\r\nbe wanting one of these years shall be sturdily growing up on these\r\nvirgin soils, where crowding is out of the question, and who may feel as\r\nthey grow up that they are part and parcel of a strong empire. For\r\nmyself, I can’t abide the idea of the English nation ever coming to play\r\nany secondary part.\r\n\r\nAs for ourselves, I feel more and more what a good thing it is, and what\r\nan economy in the long run, to have no neighbors, but the whole breadth\r\nof country to ourselves, and to be so far away from Europe that we may\r\nlook with unconcern upon the rise or fall of states there, so far as\r\nthey affect any interests of ours. That does not prevent our being all\r\nalive to events in Europe, however. The telegraph feeds our lively\r\ncuriosity, day by day; but what I write about to-day will have ceased to\r\ninterest by the time it reaches you: perhaps the strife all over there;\r\ndevoutly do I wish it may be.\r\n\r\nI see you have taken up “Anselm” again; and that, I presume, is the book\r\nyou are going to send me, and which I shall be pleased to see.\r\n\r\nYes, you must come over here; but when you do, please arrange for time\r\nenough. When you cross the ocean, be sure to stay long enough to get\r\nyour money’s worth. If it be the summer after next, perhaps we may cross\r\nthe continent together, and see the parent of your Wellingtonia tree on\r\nthe lawn, and the rest of the grove, and visit the wondrous Yosemite\r\nValley, as yet an arduous journey from San Francisco, but it will soon\r\nbe within easy reach.\r\n\r\nI see that my writing is very bad, and will stop short.\r\n\r\nInclosed are seeds of the two passion-flowers which are so good for\r\nshowing the movements of tendril, both the coiling after being touched,\r\nand revolution, etc. Sow in April in your little conservatory, or in\r\nhotbed, and you may have good plants for your purpose in June. The\r\ntendrils show off best under a temperature of 80° or 90° Fahr. P.\r\nacerifolia will give you tendrils a foot long, when in full growth.\r\n\r\nI note the uneasiness in England, and the rumors of difference in the\r\ncabinet,--dangerous times for Gladstone’s ministry, but I do hope it\r\nwill last.\r\n\r\nI suppose your church is all in order, and your cares over as to the\r\nrebuilding....\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nNovember 4, 1870.\r\n\r\nI have to-day a long letter from Bentham, which I would send to you, but\r\nthat it is full of Compositæ queries and statements, which I have soon\r\nto attend to. What a worker he is, and what a good one!\r\n\r\nAt last accounts Decaisne and Brongniart were drilling. Rather old\r\nsojers, I think! Cosson[87] had dispatched his wife and daughter and\r\ngranddaughter to England, and was communicating now and then by\r\nballoon-post! Bentham very well, and working hard at Compositæ for\r\n“Genera.” ...\r\n\r\nI have an advanced class this year, and they come up here, and take up\r\na vast deal of my time. But it is enjoyable work, as they are the pick\r\nof a dozen out of fifty or sixty of the preceding year.\r\n\r\nMarch 28, 1871.\r\n\r\n... I hope, with you, that the Domingo annexation will break down. But\r\nGrant is working for Cuba too, and that is worse than the other;\r\nignorant blacks are better than Creole Spaniards to deal with.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nFebruary 27, 1871.\r\n\r\n... There are so many things I wanted to write about your church (for\r\nwhich it was shabby of me not to remember and send you a contribution,\r\nin a small way) and the reopening services of which you sent us a\r\nnewspaper account; your “Anselm,” which we read aloud in our deliberate\r\nway, on successive Sunday evenings, when not interrupted, and very much\r\nenjoyed; I think the later chapters most; perhaps because we got more\r\ninterested as we went on, perhaps, too, the narrative flows on with a\r\nmore free movement in the later than in the earlier chapters. Then there\r\nis this wonderful German-French war, which is only now closing, if it be\r\nthe close, in such bitter humiliation of the French as no Frenchman\r\ncould ever imagine possible, nor any but a German contemplate without\r\ndeep sorrow and pity: all their hard measures of former generations\r\nmeted out to them again, to this one hapless generation, in a way that\r\ntill now it could never have dreamed of. For long years France must play\r\na secondary political part, which of itself will be a bitter thing, we\r\nmay hope a wholesome thing; and when with long care and nursing of\r\nresources she recovers, she cannot be so strong relatively again, while\r\nthe German empire holds together. And I suppose you in England have a\r\ngood deal of misgiving as to what this Germanic power portends. Perhaps\r\nthe next great wonder, and surely the best thing, may be a great\r\ndefensive alliance of English-speaking people round the world, which\r\nwould render any European continental changes less momentous.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the hopeful prospect for France is in the\r\nascendency, seemingly assured, of the conservative republicans and the\r\nOrleanists. But there are rumors that even the Orleans family are\r\nfalling out among themselves.\r\n\r\nAs I grow older I can sympathize thoroughly with a disinclination you\r\nmay feel as to assuming any new public duties. The deep ruts which the\r\ndaily routine of life has worn for us do become such pleasant paths, as\r\none ages, that we do not thank anybody for trying to force us out of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNothing have we heard or seen of Mr. Horner yet: he has gone South\r\nprobably, which is wise. I hope he will come this way in June, when we\r\nshall be very glad to see him....\r\n\r\nBy the way, I see in “Popular Science Review” a neat presentation of\r\nWallace’s points on the limitations of natural selection as applied to\r\nman, by Buckle (I suppose your Oriel friend), who makes the point very\r\nwell that these limitations apply hardly less, in their way, to other\r\nparts of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nI am too much occupied with humdrum botanical work to read or think much\r\nof such matters.\r\n\r\nHave you read or seen Bryant’s translation of the Iliad? It was\r\ndiscussed in our club last week by my neighbor, who read extracts from\r\nthis, Lord Derby’s, and other translations: it was thought to be as\r\nreadable as Lord Derby’s, to adhere quite as closely to the original,\r\nand to reflect more truly the simple directness of Homer, both of\r\nexpression and thought. I should like to know what you think of it.\r\n\r\nThe most important matter, as concerns myself, is, that I am busy with\r\nplans of building, having found a man who is disposed to give the money\r\nfor constructing here, adjacent to the herbarium, a much needed\r\nbotanical lecture-room and laboratory for students. Between the\r\nherbarium (which, you know, adjoins our house, and communicates with it)\r\nand the conservatory, there is a space of 127 feet. This we mean to fill\r\nup: First, with a one-story brick building 60 × 38 feet, rather less\r\nthan one half for botanical laboratory and cabinet, the rest\r\nlecture-room; then a lobby, and the remainder of the distance a low\r\nstove and a short, cool greenhouse, to establish connection with our\r\npresent hothouse. Then, on the one hand, I can bring plants at all\r\nseasons into the lecture-room; and on the other I can reach the same\r\nunder cover, from my private study, through the herbarium; and Mrs. Gray\r\nmay walk, in winter, from her dining-room, through our little\r\ndrawing-room, entry, library or parlor, my study, greenhouse corridor,\r\nherbarium, lobby, laboratory, lecture-room, passage, stove and\r\ncoolhouse, into conservatory, of three compartments, a long affair, but\r\ndon’t imagine anything at all grand. A snake, of which our house is the\r\nhead and the farthest wing of the conservatory the tail, will give the\r\nbest idea. In a lucky time I asked a man to build in this 127 feet, at\r\nan expense of at least twelve\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RANGE OF BUILDINGS, BOTANIC GARDEN IN 1893]\r\n\r\nthousand dollars; and I am authorized to get plans and estimates\r\ncomplete, and I suppose it will be done, though I have no positive\r\nassurance of it yet. I thought you would like to know it, without\r\nwaiting till all is absolutely settled.\r\n\r\nHere is a second sheet filled: thick paper, too, and I must cut all\r\nshort. How I wish we could be with you in Switzerland next summer!\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nMarch 10, 1871.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--It is very good of you to send me, and so kindly\r\naddress, a copy of your new book,[88] which safely reached me two days\r\nago. I have not yet had time to read any of it, except the preface and\r\nthe ending; and I do not like to dip into it and so blunt the edge of\r\ncuriosity. So I keep it well out of sight, not caring to look just yet\r\nat any of the pages which you think likely to “aggravate” me, until some\r\nday I can get a good pull at it....\r\n\r\nApril 14, 1871.\r\n\r\nYou have such a way of putting things, and you write in such a\r\ncaptivating way. One can only say:--\r\n\r\nAlmost thou persuadest me to have been “a hairy quadruped, of arboreal\r\nhabits, furnished with a tail and pointed ears,” etc.\r\n\r\nBut I have read only the first part of the book and the closing\r\nchapters; have left all the Sexual Selection till I can read it\r\nleisurely next summer, and have lent it to a judicious friend, who has\r\njust returned it.\r\n\r\nI have been besought to write notices of the book, but I decline. You\r\ndon’t know how distracted I am in these days,--doing the work of\r\nprofessor, gardener, builder, financier, and what not, all at once.\r\n\r\nBut I must not let this mail pass without sending you the little I could\r\nget as to Laura Bridgman.\r\n\r\nThrough Dr. Jarvis, a medical man, etc., I got the queries put to the\r\nwoman who has now the personal charge of Laura, and he brought me the\r\ninclosed, which I think I should not much rely on.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Howe is on hand, some day, I will see if I can get anything\r\nauthentic and particular,--not, I fear, in time for you.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 28, 1871.\r\n\r\n... Well, I say the same as then, only I feel sad about the chance of\r\nthe “Flora of North America.” What is my bête noire, as I said before,\r\nis the care of the Garden; and till I can get rid of that, by some\r\ncomplete reorganization, which shall result in the Garden’s being much\r\nbetter seen to than it has been,--better taken care of and better named\r\nup and superintended,--I shall not be comfortable nor of much use in\r\nwriting “Flora of North America.”\r\n\r\nI am going to try if I cannot find or make some sort of superintendent,\r\nand pay him out of what I pay for rent of house, and have succeeded in\r\ngetting credited to Botanic Garden fund. This will leave me to pay for\r\nwork in the herbarium (which is the work you prefer) out of the only\r\n$800 a year yielded by herbarium fund, which has first of all to pay for\r\nbooks, paper, fuel, and freights,--in short, most of it, and some years\r\nall,--must come out of my own pocket, until I can find somebody who will\r\nendow a curatorship. Or else I must put this work in the herbarium on to\r\nmy assistant, Farlow, who, however, will have his hands full enough\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\nAs to the way you are doing up Cuban botany, I do not find fault with\r\nit. I think, with you, that you are doing about the best possible thing\r\nunder the circumstances. The only thing that you may justly complain of\r\nme for, I think, is my sensitiveness and pooh-poohing new-species-making\r\nin families where old species are yet all in a jumble, and where I have\r\nthought that you could not yet tell what were new and what old. I dare\r\nsay I have been too impatient about it, and I see I have hurt your\r\nfeelings somewhat, which I am sorry for. I only meant, take time and\r\npains to clear up the old ones in the books, and get a better assurance,\r\nif you can, about the proposed new ones. But, after all, it is wrong and\r\nfoolish in me to worry myself, or you, about them.\r\n\r\nYou will have more experience of the sort, in the working up of your San\r\nDomingo collection. But if we can get time to refer doubtful cases to\r\nsay Oliver at Kew, and some one at Paris (where they have many old San\r\nDomingo plants), I suppose you may get them pretty straight....\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nSeptember 10, 1871.\r\n\r\nI have addressed the envelope for this letter before writing it,\r\ndetermined to use once more the familiar superscription. The official\r\nmay bide its time.[89]\r\n\r\nOnly yesterday we learned of Gladstone’s doings by a newspaper slip sent\r\nus by a friend who knew of you through us on the Nile, Mrs. Howland. But\r\nI had a sort of premonition of it and was on the lookout....\r\n\r\nI do not know where the Deanery is,--not in so attractive a situation as\r\nWhatley Rectory, one may safely say. But I suppose you are not expected\r\nto reside there in summer, that you will be fairly able to have some\r\ncountry quarters to your liking. And there is Switzerland always within\r\nreach. Happy mortals, who can reach the Alps within forty-eight hours,\r\nand with only a narrow, though proverbially nasty, bit of water to\r\ncross! But what we hope to gain from this upturning is to see you over\r\nhere. When Mr. Horner returns (we have heard nothing since they vanished\r\nin the West) he will tell you it is no formidable matter even to cross\r\nthe continent. At least you can come and see us, make us a long visit,\r\nand be as quiet here as in a Swiss wayside inn, and sally forth upon an\r\nexcursion when you like.\r\n\r\nPlease thank Mrs. Church from me for thinking of us, and writing the\r\nvery next day after this anxious matter was concluded. It is wonderful\r\nshe could find time, with so much to do and to think of. And such a full\r\naccount of the Swiss journey, too.\r\n\r\nI owe you letters, too,--one at least lies reproachingly in a drawer of\r\nmy table, where it was thrust a long while ago along with many others\r\nwhich could be postponed; but once postponed it is not easy to overtake\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSay to Mrs. C. it is not a part of our house which was moved; that would\r\nnot have been difficult, for it is of wood (though the herbarium, etc.,\r\nadjacent is of brick). It must have been the Law School the moving of\r\nwhich Mrs. Gray was describing. Tell Mr. Horner that, like some other\r\nthings, when once you have seen it done it ceases to be wonderful or\r\neven difficult.\r\n\r\nAs to my lecture-room, etc., all work stopped for near a month,\r\nincluding the fortnight or more when I was away; and now (September 11)\r\nall has been clatter and hurry for the last week or so, and they really\r\nseem determined to fulfill the terms of their contract, to finish by the\r\n15th instant. They cannot do that; but I trust the workmen may go out\r\nwith the month. These cares of building have sadly interferred with\r\nscientific work all summer. I have accomplished very little of what I\r\nintended. I attended, and, when the last year’s president retired on\r\ndelivering his address, presided over, the American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, twentieth meeting, at Indianapolis, capital of\r\nthe State of Indiana,--a journey of forty-eight hours, in very sultry\r\nsummer weather, over long stretches of country. I broke the journey by a\r\nday in New York, to see two sons of Mr. Darwin just as they landed, and\r\nby a three days’ stay, including Sunday, with my old friend Mr.\r\nSullivant, in Ohio. The meeting was a pleasant, though not especially\r\ninteresting one. I met botanical correspondents of many years’ standing\r\nwhom I had never seen. At the close we were invited to make an excursion\r\nto the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, which I counted on seeing. But I found\r\nthat the excursion was to be an overcrowded one.... So I hastened\r\nhomeward, and was with Mrs. Gray at Beverly Farms, where she had been\r\npassing holidays at Mrs. Loring’s at the paternal homestead on the\r\nseashore,--a place that you have heard us talk of not a little. It is\r\ndelightful. I know nothing to give you so good an idea of it as the\r\nDevonshire coast, there being plenty of wood quite down to the water.\r\nWere we there now, Miss K. and Charles Loring would, I know, charge me\r\nwith messages.\r\n\r\nI must tell you that the Scientific Association is invited to meet at\r\nSan Francisco, California, next summer; and that we have fixed the\r\nmeeting there conditionally, that is, in case the Californians care\r\nenough for our presence to transport a certain number of our\r\nrepresentative men free of cost, or nearly so, across the wide\r\ncontinent. If not, we are to meet on the northern part of the\r\nMississippi,--at Dubuque, Iowa, far enough west in all conscience, but a\r\nplace from which we may easily reach the Falls of St. Anthony and Lake\r\nSuperior. I must needs attend, as I shall have a retiring address to\r\ndeliver. And though I can ill spare the time or afford the expense, yet\r\nMrs. Gray and I are longing to see California. What say you and Mrs.\r\nChurch about joining us for your next summer’s vacation? The mountains\r\nwhich form the sides of the Yosemite Valley will hardly offer as many\r\nkinds of flowers as the alpine turf of the Riffelberg, but they may be\r\nmore novel to you....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 1871, Dr. Gray wrote to President Eliot, after\r\ndescribing formally the completion of the new buildings, and something\r\nof the history and arrangement of the department, the following letter:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... I beg to add, for your consideration and that of the corporation, a\r\nfew words of a personal character.\r\n\r\nWith the present academic year I shall have completed thirty years of\r\nservice in the professorial chair to which I was called in the spring of\r\n1842. The Garden, which had been under no professorial care for years,\r\nand which has since had a long and hard struggle for existence, the\r\nconservatories, the herbarium and its library, both steadily increasing,\r\nand now the lecture-room, laboratory, etc., make up an establishment\r\nwhich has grown by degrees into one which requires much time, care, and\r\nanxiety to administer, and for which I have now done the main part of\r\nwhat could be expected of me or any one man. The experience of the last\r\nand the present year clearly shows me that the work of instruction,\r\nsteadily increasing in its demands under the present system, weighted\r\nmore and more with the load of administration, is more than I can carry\r\non. I have some warnings, besides, of the increase of years, which I\r\nought to consider; and I definitively propose to lay down, at the close\r\nof the present academic year, as large a part of this load as I possibly\r\ncan without serious prejudice to this department and this establishment.\r\nI suppose that either the duties of instruction or of administration,\r\nbeyond that of the herbarium, must be entirely surrendered. If I can be\r\nspared, and if what I could do for the herbarium could be reckoned an\r\nequivalent for rent of the house I reside in, I should crave to resign\r\nboth the charge of the Garden and of the professorship. There is reason\r\nto think that the time is at hand when changes such as are here\r\nsuggested may be propitiously made.\r\n\r\nWhen I came here, in 1842, I was carrying on and publishing a most\r\nimportant original work, the “Flora of North America.” I have worked on\r\nit from time to time, but I never have been able to publish any more of\r\nit. And now what was done has all to be done again, and carried if\r\npossible to a completion; and there is no one else to do it if I do not.\r\nMy educational books, or most of them, require to be re-edited; and I\r\nfail to find time and sufficient freedom of mind for the undertaking. If\r\nI could accomplish these tasks, or a good part of them, I am of opinion\r\nthat I should in consequence be able (as is especially my desire) to do\r\na great deal more for the university and the permanent interest of this\r\nestablishment than I can expect now to do, as at present situated, even\r\nif it were possible or probable that I could so continue for any length\r\nof time. I am,\r\n\r\nVery respectfully and truly yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 4, 1872.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,--I have a horrid cold, which makes me unwell.\r\n\r\nI write a brief line, in response to yours of yesterday, mainly to say\r\nthat I fear I disagree with you about the reply to be made to Wilkes’s\r\nurgent request to print the manuscript of the Oregon collection of\r\nWilkes’ Expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was prepared to print long ago; is not your fault that it has been\r\ndelayed so long. The library committee have a right to print it, and\r\nmight do so without your corrections if you decline to make any. We want\r\nthe plates, which are now thrown away, and must be published. I would\r\nprint in the form of a naked list,--except where remarks and\r\ndescriptions are still wanted,--and to make all right and sure, and to\r\nrelieve you, I, with Watson’s kind help, will fix it all up for you and\r\nread the proofs once, and so save you the worry. And I urgently request\r\nyou to send this line to Professor Henry, as embodying my opinion, and\r\nmy offer of help.\r\n\r\nI am sure that if the rest of my manuscript is called for, I shall turn\r\nit over with satisfaction, though the same applies to it as to yours.\r\nAnd I should either alter accordingly or add notes.\r\n\r\nThe rest of your letter I will respond to in due time.\r\n\r\nBut I feel concerned to have those Oregon plates out.\r\n\r\nI think I have some right to, as I paid for one hundred of them; but\r\nthat is no matter. They are now neither published nor unpublished, which\r\nis a bad state of things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray had the manuscript prepared some years before for the second\r\nvolume of the “United States Exploring Expedition,” and notified the\r\nlibrary committee that he was ready for publishing. Meantime came the\r\nwar, and there was no money or thought for such things. When the country\r\nwas again quiet and prosperous, the library committee who had formerly\r\nknown and been interested in the work and its printing had passed away;\r\nthere was no one to care for it, and the manuscript was never called\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 7, 1872.\r\n\r\nMr. Packard, one of our best entomologists, a most excellent and modest\r\nman, has asked to be introduced to you, that he may pay his respects.\r\n\r\nI shy or refuse such applications generally, saying you can rarely see\r\nvisitors or callers. But Packard is “fish to your net,” has his head\r\ncrammed with facts bearing on derivation, is a disciple of the\r\nHyatt-Cope school, that you may have heard of,--people who have got hold\r\nof what they call a law, though I do not see that they contribute any\r\nvera causa at all.\r\n\r\nIf you will turn the world of science upside down, you must expect that\r\npeople will wish to see you....\r\n\r\nMay 31.\r\n\r\nBy the hand of an old correspondent of yours, and cousin of ours, Mr.\r\nBrace, I send you a little book, which may amuse you, in seeing your own\r\nscience adapted to juvenile minds.[90] In some of those hours in which\r\nyou can do no better than read, or hear read, “trashy novels,” you might\r\ntry this instead. It will hardly rival “The Jumping Frog,” and the like\r\nspecimens of American literature which you first made known to us....\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nBOTANIC GARDEN, June 10, 1872.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--You must set me down as a faithless correspondent.\r\nYour pleasant letter of April 6, from Paris, has been long upon my\r\ntable, and I think there is one of older date somewhere below. But all\r\nthis spring I have been so overworked that I could respond only to the\r\nmost necessary letters of business, duties of my professorship, of the\r\nGarden, and many other things. Well, my lectures are over, and for the\r\nensuing year I may hope for some emendation. I give up the\r\nsuperintendence of the Botanic Garden, which has become a great burden,\r\nand I nominally devolve other university work in part upon an\r\nassistant, surrendering at the same time a part of my salary, hoping\r\nthereby to purchase time. We shall see if it be possible. But I have to\r\nbegin with a new assistant, who will need training; but will then, I\r\nhope, take much off my hands. My youthful assistant of the past two\r\nyears goes in a week or two to Europe, to study in some German\r\nuniversity for a year or two; to Strasburg, I think, unless he first\r\nshould go to Sweden, and there study Algæ, with Agardh, if he will\r\nreceive him. He takes a fancy to lower Cryptogamia. His name is Farlow,\r\nan honest, good fellow. He will most likely be in Switzerland in the\r\nsummer; and I shall give him a letter of introduction to you, whom he\r\nwill wish to know. But take no trouble on his account, except to\r\nintroduce him to Dr. Müller, from whom, as a working lichenologist, he\r\ncould learn much.\r\n\r\nWell, Mrs. Gray and I are going to set out, two weeks hence, for\r\nCalifornia. We both need the change, and are curious to see the country,\r\nhaving never seen even the Mississippi! The scientific meeting was to\r\nhave been held there; but there is now a hitch about it. We go, however,\r\nat all events, and expect to pass a month in the Yosemite Valley, and\r\nelsewhere in the mountain region. I wish you were here to go with us.\r\nHooker was counted on to go with us; but the very bad state of his\r\nmother’s (Lady Hooker) health, and the state of affairs at Kew prevent\r\nit....\r\n\r\nI hope soon to receive your “Mélanges historiques,” which are sure to\r\ninterest me. If I can I will write you a long letter from California, or\r\nUtah, or the Rocky Mountains!--more interesting than this scrawl from\r\nyours ever,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO JAMES D. DANA.\r\n\r\nJune 22, 1872.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DANA,--I fancy you have got hold of a good topic for your\r\nhandling, and have a promising inquiry before you, in coördinating\r\ncephalization and natural selection as operative on the nervous system\r\nof animals. I expect you to get something interesting out of it.\r\n\r\nBut every now and then something you write makes me doubt if you quite\r\nget hold just right of Darwinian natural selection. What you still say\r\nabout struggle not applicable to plants makes me think so.\r\n\r\nSuppose the term be a personification, as, no doubt, strictly it is. One\r\nso fond as you are of personification and good general expressions ought\r\nnot to object to what seems to me a happy term.\r\n\r\nSpeaking from general memory, I should say that the term, as used to\r\nexpress what we mean, was introduced by the elder De Candolle and\r\napplied in what I thought a happy way to the vegetable kingdom. I cannot\r\ndrop it because you say there is no struggle where there is no will;\r\nperhaps you mean without consciousness, and then the field of struggle\r\nwill be much limited. But call the action what you please,--competition\r\n(that is open to the same objection), collision, or what not,--it is\r\njust what I should think Darwin was driving at. Read “Origin” (4th ed.),\r\npp. 72, 73, and so on, through the chapter, especially pp. 81-86.\r\n\r\nThis is enough to show you that when you speak of “Darwinian struggle”\r\nas occurring only “when the faculties of an animal are called into\r\nrequisition,” you take too limited a view of what Darwin means.\r\n\r\nFor myself I should say that the faculties of the lowest animals and the\r\nfaculties of plants were equally called into requisition in the case,\r\nin a manner so parallel that there is no drawing any but a purely\r\narbitrary distinction between the one and the other.\r\n\r\nI conceive one as effective as the other as regards the leading on and\r\nfixing variation.\r\n\r\nWhen I say now again that the expression “fitted by its regional\r\ndevelopment to the region” conveys no clear meaning to me, I am only\r\ntelling you, as I did before, my way of looking at things, not finding\r\nfault with yours.\r\n\r\nBy the way; “variation (inherent) in particular directions,” is your\r\nidea and mine, but is very anti-Darwin. Good-night.\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray greatly enjoyed his visit to California, with the long overland\r\njourney thither. It was an ever-renewed excitement to see plants growing\r\nwhich he had seen only as dried specimens, and the conductor of the\r\ntrain was at last almost in despair at the scattering of his passengers\r\nto grab what they could in the short halts, as they became inspired by\r\nseeing Dr. Gray rush as the engine slowed, to catch all within reach.\r\nThen when in motion again the specimens were brought from all sides to\r\nsee what they were. And the preparing and drying went on to the wonder\r\nof some and the interest of all.\r\n\r\nHis ascent of Gray’s Peak was made a great occasion in the neighborhood.\r\nA large party gathered from Georgetown and Empire City, and started the\r\nafternoon before, after having been most hospitably dined by Judge\r\nMcMurdy, in Georgetown; the night was passed in a mining-tavern cabin,\r\nand the ascent, some going on horseback, some on foot, was made the\r\nnext morning. Speeches were made on the summit, and resolutions passed\r\nto confirm the names Gray’s and Torrey’s peaks given in 1862 by Dr.\r\nParry, who was himself happily with the party. The ascent is not as\r\ndifficult as in most mountains of that height, as one can ride on\r\nhorseback to the top in August, when the snow lies only in patches; the\r\ntrail is mostly over the rough shale, and for a month or two the summit,\r\nthough over 14,000 feet, is almost bare. The view of the innumerable\r\npeaks is very magnificent.\r\n\r\nAt Dubuque he was the guest of an old Fairfield comrade. As the retiring\r\npresident of the American Association he gave his address,[91] written\r\nmostly in the cars on the long overland journey, in which he explained\r\nstill further some of his long-meditated conclusions on the distribution\r\nof the flora of Western North America.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October, 1872.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHURCH,--I promised to myself, if I did not to you, that I would\r\nwrite you from the other side of this continent; but writing and\r\njourneying are incompatible, at least in case where the time for the one\r\nis too short for your undertakings. But now we have been a month at\r\nhome, and more; the accumulation of things to be seen to is worked off\r\nor nearly, and I mean now to tell you something of our summer’s doings.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were free we set out.... At Chicago we had two nights and\r\na day in which to see the desolated and fast rebuilding town. From this\r\nplace, over a thousand miles west of Boston, we made our proper\r\nstart.... A welcome rain cooled the air and laid the dust that morning,\r\nand not a drop more of rain did we see, any more than in Egypt, from\r\nthat day onward, until, six or seven weeks later, we were back at the\r\neastern base of the Rocky Mountains, when there was an evening\r\nthunderstorm, and the next morning I called Mrs. Gray to the window to\r\nsee a novel sight,--the streets dripping and muddy! I wish I could\r\ndescribe to you our journey, and the sort of life we were leading. But\r\nif I go into particulars there will be no end.\r\n\r\nAt Omaha we were on the Pacific Railroad proper, and soon upon the\r\nplains, at first the larger part cultivated, but barer and drier as we\r\nadvanced westward, and ascended imperceptibly; so that the next\r\ntwenty-four hours brought us, with some fine views of the range, to the\r\nfoot of the Rocky Mountains and a height of 5,000 or 6,000 feet above\r\nthe sea; that afternoon over the Black Hills of the Platte, 2,000 or\r\n3,000 feet higher, and the highest elevation of the road,--higher than\r\nthe passes through the Rocky Mountains beyond,--and at nightfall we were\r\ntraversing the wide grassy Laramie Plains, a vast, sequestered\r\nsub-alpine meadow. And when I rose early next morning, we were running\r\nthrough a dry desert “sage brush” (wormwood) region (desert, except for\r\nthe botanist,--the first plant I saw and clutched proved to be Grayia),\r\nthe scanty waters of which run into the Colorado of the West and the\r\nGulf of California.\r\n\r\nAnother twenty-four hours, through grand scenery, brought us, after\r\nthree nights in our car berths, to Ogden, on Salt Lake, where we took a\r\nbranch road and, skirting the lake along the whole eastern shore,\r\nreached Salt Lake City, the Mormon town, before sunset. Here we passed\r\ntwo nights and a day, and enjoyed scenery worth crossing the ocean for,\r\nand saw something of the strange life of the district.\r\n\r\nBack to Ogden; two more nights and days, one long day crossing the\r\nHumboldt desert, rendered passable only by the Humboldt River, which,\r\nthough the ragged mountains all run north and south, yet runs from east\r\nto west and marks its course by a narrow line of greenness, and at dusk\r\nwe saw its end in the Humboldt sink, a lagoon without outlet on the\r\nwestern verge of the basin, against the Sierra, the arid side of which\r\nwe were ascending all night, to awake among pine forests at sunrise; to\r\nbreakfast upon the very summit soon after; to descend through most\r\nstriking scenery into the great valley of California, and, traversing\r\nthat and the Contra Costa range, to see the head of the Bay of San\r\nFrancisco at dusk; to cross the bay in a steam-ferry, and reach our\r\nhotel in San Francisco at ten P.M.,--a journey full of interest, not a\r\nbit monotonous or dull, from first to last. There were fatigues and\r\nsmall discomforts, of course, but these are all forgotten long ago, and\r\nthe whole transit dwells in memory as one continual and delightful piece\r\nof pleasant, novel, ever-varied, and instructive sight-seeing. Of course\r\nthe identifying at sight, as we flew by, of flowers new to me in the\r\nliving state, and the snatching at halts, and the physical features of\r\ndistricts which I had always been interested in, and knew much about but\r\nhad never seen, all gave me occupation and continual pleasure. But it\r\nwas much the same with all the party. Even the return journey was hardly\r\nless interesting....\r\n\r\nFrom Dubuque we took steamer up the Mississippi River, through its\r\nfinest scenery up to St. Paul, Minnesota; saw the falls of St. Anthony\r\nand Minnehaha; thence, while the rest of our party essayed Lake\r\nSuperior, Mrs. Gray and I returned home by rapid stages.\r\n\r\nI have only to-day finished the study and laying into the herbarium of\r\nspecimens I gathered and dried, regretting the while that I did not\r\ncollect more specimens and many other species, as I might have done.\r\n\r\nTyndall is in Boston, and I trust will be with us next week. I have not\r\nyet seen him, nor Froude, nor even MacDonald, the third lecturing\r\nnotability in Boston.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 6, 1872.\r\n\r\nYou delight me by your promise to take up Dionæa and Drosera now, and I\r\nimagine you as now about it. Good! And I am so glad you will take that\r\nopportunity to collect your botanical and quasi-botanical papers. These,\r\nwith the Dionæa, etc., will make a nice and most welcome volume.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your query, I think I can “support the idea,” or the\r\nprobability of it, “that tendrils become spiral after clasping an object\r\nfrom the stimulus from contact running down them.” For though some\r\n“tendrils do become spiral when they have clasped nothing,” others do\r\nnot. The adjustment of the unstable equilibrium is more delicate in the\r\nformer, so that it starts under some inappreciable cause or stimulus.\r\nThat the stimulus may be so propagated downward is clear in the\r\nsensitive plant, where the closing of the leaflets in succession will\r\nfollow the closing of the ultimate pair under slight and local\r\nirritation. And in the tendril the coiling below is just a continuation\r\nof the same movement or same change as that which incurved the tip in\r\nclasping, that is, a relative shortening of concave or lengthening of\r\nthe convex side of the tendril. Would you not infer that the action was\r\npropagated downward?\r\n\r\nSo you were astonished at Mrs. Gray’s audacity. Well, “toujours\r\nl’audace;” she is all the better for it. Some horseback work in getting\r\nto and into the Yosemite Valley was severe, but she bore it so well that\r\nI ventured, when we made our detour into the Colorado Rocky Mountains,\r\nto take her up to the summit of Gray’s Peak, 14,300 feet, or\r\nthereabouts, where she acquitted herself nobly. The day was perfect, the\r\nsuccess complete, and the memory of it one of the most delightful of the\r\nmany pleasant memories of the whole journey. Our great trip was the\r\nround from San Francisco to Mariposa Grove, Yosemite Valley, entering\r\nover Glacier Point, from which (tell your sons) is a new trail down the\r\n4,000 feet into the valley; made excursions from the valley during\r\nseveral days, and returned by a long sweep through the little Tuolumne\r\ngrove, round foothills to Murphy’s and the Calaveras Grove, and so back\r\nto San Francisco. Afterwards Mrs. Gray and I went to Santa Cruz and up\r\nthe San Lorenzo Valley among noble redwoods, rivaling the Sequoia\r\ngigantea. On return we made one stretch to the east base of the Rocky\r\nMountains, then down to Denver, and up into the mountains, to 8,400\r\nfeet, where we had a pleasant week or more (just the climate to give\r\nstrength to an invalid), whence I climbed a high mountain or two, among\r\nthem Gray’s Peak, the highest, as already mentioned. Thence we came down\r\nto Dubuque and hot weather, on the Mississippi to St. Paul and St.\r\nAnthony, etc., and then home by rail, having been twelve busy weeks\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWell, we are longing to do it again, and more! But I am settling down to\r\nmy work as well as I may, well content with the summer’s holiday.\r\n\r\nDecember 2, 1872.\r\n\r\nWell, it is wonderful, your finding the nervous system of Dionæa!!! Pray\r\ntake your time next spring, and do up both Drosera and Dionæa. I will\r\nendeavor next spring to get hold of Drosera filiformis and make the\r\nobservations. I will also do better, by sending your note on to Mr.\r\nCanby, who lives near its habitat, and has done something already in\r\nsuch observations.\r\n\r\nAs to coiling of tendril. I think your idea is that in the coiling of a\r\nfixed tendril, one coil has its concave side the opposite of the part\r\nthat has coiled the other way.\r\n\r\nNow take a piece of tape say a span long; black one side, let some one\r\nhold the two ends while you twist in the middle. The two halves are\r\ncoiled in opposite directions, just as a tendril which has caught does.\r\nThe same color will be on the outside of the coil all the length.\r\n\r\nBlacken with a stroke of paint a line along the whole length of a caught\r\ntendril. On straightening it out the black will be all on one side.\r\n\r\nI have not had time to follow it up, and need not, since you are sure to\r\ndo it. But I think it clear that one and the same side is concave, that\r\nis, the relatively shortened side, the whole length of the caught\r\ntendril. Do not you?\r\n\r\nMrs. Gray is absent while I write, or she would add her best regards and\r\nbest wishes to my own for a happy New Year to you all.\r\n\r\nTO C. W. ELIOT.\r\n\r\nBOTANIC GARDEN, CAMBRIDGE, January 1, 1873.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PRESIDENT ELIOT,--Will you kindly present the inclosed\r\ncommunication to the corporation at its next meeting.\r\n\r\nI need not say to you that I could not take so serious a step as this\r\nwithout much consideration, and that I would not do it if I were not\r\nconfident that the department which I have served in the university for\r\nalmost thirty-one years need not now suffer by my withdrawal. I am\r\nwarned also by growing experience of the fact that the needful work\r\nwhich I could formerly do with ease can now be done only by effort,\r\nfollowed by exhaustion and other unpleasant effects, which may be\r\nexpected to increase; and it is clear that I have left to me, at best,\r\nbarely time enough, when rigorously economized, to complete the works\r\nfor which I have long been pledged, and without the accomplishment of\r\nwhich my life will have been largely a failure. The corporation will\r\nperceive that I do not intend to be idle, but to concentrate what\r\nenergies remain to me upon the kind of work for which I am best--and\r\nindeed peculiarly--fitted, both by disposition and by more than forty\r\nyears of preparation. As this work proceeds, the herbarium of the\r\nuniversity, always requiring attention during its continued increase,\r\nwill be put into the condition in which I should leave it, with its\r\nvalue greatly enhanced. In view of this, and of the fact that the\r\nherbarium forms an important part of the apparatus of instruction here,\r\nI trust the corporation will think it reasonable to allow me the\r\npossession of the house I live in, in recompense of my services as\r\ncurator of the herbarium.\r\n\r\nI offer my resignation unconditionally, that the corporation may have,\r\nas it should, the whole matter in its hands without embarrassment. If it\r\nbe desired to keep my name for the present upon the catalogue, and\r\nespecially if the corporation should prefer not to place a permanent\r\nincumbent just yet in the Fisher professorship, I would in that case\r\ntake the liberty to suggest that the present very capable and efficient\r\nassistant, Dr. Goodale, be made adjunct professor of vegetable\r\nphysiology, with salary assigned from the Fisher professorship. I\r\nremain, dear Mr. President,\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\n_Messrs. the President and Fellows of Harvard College_:\r\n\r\nHONORABLE AND DEAR SIRS,--The time has arrived when I may, as I think\r\nwithout detriment to the university, retire from the professorship to\r\nwhich I was appointed in the spring of 1842; and I hereby tender my\r\nresignation of it, to take effect at the close of the present academic\r\nyear, when I shall have completed thirty-one years of service.\r\n\r\nI trust that I may still be useful to the university; and if agreeable\r\nto the corporation I should like to continue to be Curator of the\r\nHerbarium. With sincere regard, I am your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\nBOTANIC GARDEN, CAMBRIDGE, January 1, 1873.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 14, 1873.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--I am much and long in your debt,--all the more by\r\nyour agreeable letter of the 16th ult....\r\n\r\nLet me note points in your letter. Your volume of “Mélanges,” etc., has\r\nnot yet come to hand,--but it is sure to come in time through the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, and will be received with welcome. I will see\r\nto the reproduction of the article on the Dominant Language of the\r\nTwentieth Century,--English of course. I am glad you will make a full\r\nindex of the “Prodromus” quoad Genera. I wish it had been species, also!\r\n\r\nGlaciers in California! Why, there is a fair remnant of one now, on the\r\nnorth side of Shasta,--and more in the southern part of the Sierra; and\r\nas to glacial marks, the geologists note them abundantly.\r\n\r\nI am glad you saw much of Mr. Adams at Vallon. Madame A. is the more of\r\na talker, is she not? Or, perhaps she does not speak French. Adams is\r\nvice-president of our American Academy; and is, I hope, presiding this\r\nevening at a meeting which I myself am not well enough to attend. I hope\r\nhe will become president, for I mean to retire in May....\r\n\r\nDr. Parry passed last summer in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, where\r\nMadame and I visited him, in his cabin; and we ascended Gray’s Peak\r\ntogether (14,400 feet). Torrey, old as he is, was there later, but did\r\nnot get up the twin Torrey’s Peak, though his daughter did surmount\r\nGray’s Peak....\r\n\r\nNow about myself. In what time I can save I am assisting Brewer in the\r\n“Flora of California,” and shall do for him the Monopetalæ, and finish\r\nnext summer, if my health does not fail.\r\n\r\nMoreover, this is my last year of university work. I finish in July, and\r\nthen resign, and give my remaining time to the “Flora of North America.”\r\nAlthough it is so arranged, it is not yet to be announced. It is\r\ndifficult to drop at once the many things I have charge of, and the\r\nvast correspondence all over the country, which has been very useful to\r\nme, and others, but which takes a deal of time. But I am making a fairly\r\ngood beginning. Mrs. Gray delights with me in the prospect of release\r\nfrom many a care, and of devoting myself without distraction to the work\r\nI have always liked best.\r\n\r\nI really hope it is not too late to do something (a few lines from you\r\nupon this subject might, _entre nous_, be useful to me).\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, May 18, 1873.\r\n\r\n... I cannot object to your maintaining the hypothesis that each and\r\nevery existing plant and animal form has been directly created (or\r\nmediately created, if you see a difference) out of the soil, pure\r\nhypothesis though it be, and one which “from the nature of the case can\r\nnever be directly proved.” It is natural that you should hold to such\r\nhypothesis as long as you believe it to be possibly tenable.\r\n\r\nBut what I may ask you very seriously to consider is, whether you are\r\nprepared to bear the responsibility you assume in maintaining and\r\nteaching that no hypothesis of the derivation of existing “specific”\r\nforms from previous ones more or less like them can logically be\r\ntheistic and religious. How far any such hypothesis may be probable or\r\ntenable in view of the evidence is not the question raised, but a far\r\nmore momentous one.\r\n\r\nConsider what the “younger men who learn of you” will be likely to think\r\nwhen they come to discard, as the best informed ones probably will after\r\na while, your scientific views on this subject; but still, perchance,\r\nconfide in your dictum that the doctrine of the derivative origin of one\r\nspecies from another cannot logically stop short of “blank materialism,\r\ndestructive both of science and religion, and even ... to morals and\r\nsocial organization.”\r\n\r\nThere will be “a heavy penalty to pay,” but there are two sides to the\r\nquestion as to who is to pay a part of it. What I said in the last\r\nparagraph of the Dubuque address “we need not here consider”[92] is,\r\nnevertheless, worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\nThe time is not very distant, I imagine, when those who have protested\r\nagainst such reckless statements will be thought to have done some\r\nservice to religion as well as to science.\r\n\r\nI trust that the foundations of theism and of the Christian religion\r\nrest upon firmer foundations than the so-called “immutability of\r\nspecies.”\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 12, 1873.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--I must be in your eyes a disgracefully negligent\r\ncorrespondent and an ungrateful friend. I think, however, that I must\r\nhave acknowledged the arrival of your volume which I received, I think,\r\nin March,--more likely late in February. The attempt at a perusal of it\r\nwas when, on the 12th March, I went on to New York to pay the last\r\nduties to my venerable and good friend and associate, Dr. Torrey. I read\r\na good part of the volume on the railway journeys, and planned a review\r\nof several of the articles. Then, a month later, I broke away from my\r\nlaborious life here, and made a visit to my old friend Professor Henry,\r\nat Washington. I even went as much farther south, to Wilmington, North\r\nCarolina, where I met the spring in all its beauty, a month in advance\r\nof our tardy north. I collected a lot of live Dionæas, etc. I returned\r\nto a great accession of university work, my assistant being obliged to\r\nleave me on the 1st of May.\r\n\r\nTo return to your volume: I called Professor Henry’s attention to it, as\r\none which would all through interest him much, if ever he finds time to\r\nread it. He will translate the article on the Language of the Twentieth\r\nCentury for his Report, and perhaps others.\r\n\r\nAt a time when I was already overloaded, the death of dear Torrey has\r\nthrown some cares and extra work upon me. I have to carry through the\r\npress a report of his upon the plants collected in west North America,\r\nin Wilkes’s Expedition, which was drawn up, but never really finished,\r\ntwelve years ago, and was called for just during Torrey’s last sickness,\r\nand to his annoyance, which I felt bound to relieve as well as I could.\r\n\r\nThen, six weeks or more ago, died my next oldest friend and companion,\r\nSullivant, making a sad spring and giving me a needed warning to make\r\nhaste. He again leaves two unfinished works which I must see to, though\r\nLesquereux will, I trust, edit them. Of one, indeed, he was to be joint\r\nauthor. The other, a second volume of the beautiful “Icones Muscorum,”\r\nis ready as to the plates, but not at all so, I learn, for the\r\nletterpress.\r\n\r\nFor myself, as I think I have already told you, this summer completing\r\nthirty-one years of professorial work in the university, I am relieved\r\nfrom further duties of instruction,--and of my salary. I shall not\r\nexperience the full relief until the very close of summer. For, in the\r\ninterest of this department of the university, and to leave it in proper\r\nworking condition, I have undertaken a course of what we call university\r\nlectures,--meaning lectures intended the rather for others than members\r\nof the university,--and have opened the botanical laboratory to pupils,\r\nmainly teachers in schools, for the summer.[93] Considerable time must\r\nbe given to them, but, after a few weeks, I hope to throw it mainly upon\r\nmy assistant, Professor Goodale.\r\n\r\nProfessor Goodale, under appointment as assistant professor of vegetable\r\nphysiology, will take the whole work of instruction in botany off my\r\nhands; but if a former assistant and pupil, Dr. Farlow, now with De\r\nBary, proves capable of it, as I hope, he will, I trust, take up the\r\nwork in systematic botany. His fancy, however, is for Cryptogamia.\r\n\r\nMr. Sereno Watson is the only one here to do work in systematic botany,\r\nbut he will not teach. He and I are endeavoring to help out Professor\r\nBrewer in the “Flora of California,” which, to be done at all, must be\r\npushed through at once. I have promised to do the Gamopetalæ, which come\r\nin the field I am striving to cover for the “Flora of North America.”\r\nThat work I hope now to give myself to.\r\n\r\nI ought to have taken this step several years ago; but I could not\r\nafford it, and it is only now that I have been able to bring the\r\ndepartment here into the position in which I feel justified in resigning\r\nthe care of it. I retain the charge of the herbarium, and I continue my\r\nresidence in the house which is connected with it.\r\n\r\nDr. Torrey’s herbarium and library were made over to Columbia College,\r\nand will be kept up, although no professor will be appointed at present.\r\n\r\nMr. Sullivant’s bryological collections and library are to come here.\r\n\r\nI send you by mail a copy of my biographical notices of Torrey and\r\nSullivant; both from “American Academy Council Report of Proceedings,”\r\nand both printed in advance, in “Silliman’s Journal,” where you will see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I have resigned the chair of the American Academy, after ten\r\nyears’ occupation, and it is taken by Mr. Adams, whom you know. The\r\nthird class (classical and historical) takes its turn.\r\n\r\nTO W. M. CANBY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 30, 1873.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CANBY,--My Dionæas grow finely, and are the delight of my heart.\r\n\r\nDrosera longifolia, also cultivated, is almost as good a fly-catcher.\r\n\r\nNow and then I see a little exudation inside base of hood of Sarracenia\r\nflava, which answers to what my Southern correspondent pointed out; but\r\nis not very marked....\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 7.\r\n\r\n... I have also seen here that water is secreted in the pitcher of Sarr.\r\nflava before the lid is open.\r\n\r\nBut I have also seen some time ago, when the weather got rather warm,\r\nvery minute globules like finest dew on the erect part of the lid, near\r\nbase, inside. And, lately, during the very warm days, I found in some\r\nthis increased, and the droplets running together into a clammy\r\nexudation. But I want to see more of it. I shall watch, as I get a\r\nchance, and the weather gets hot. Look at yours. See if there is\r\nanything of the sort in S. purpurea; I think not.\r\n\r\nI have not the book yet. But I somehow understand that this exudation on\r\nthe lid is mentioned in the English translation of Le Maout and\r\nDecaisne’s “General Treatise of Botany!” The French has it not. Very\r\nlikely it has been found out by Darwin, who finds out everything!\r\n\r\n... _Conundrum?_ Why does the Dionæa trap close only part way, so as to\r\ncross the bristles of edge only, at first, and afterwards close fully?\r\n\r\nDarwin has hit it. I wonder you or I never thought of it.\r\n\r\nA. G.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 27, 1873.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--If I were a better correspondent, I should have\r\nlong ago thanked you for your interesting and welcome letter of August\r\n11, from Samaden. I was in the Engadine when last in Switzerland, and\r\ngot near the top of Piz Langarde, when a storm drove me back.\r\n\r\nYour announcement leads me to expect soon the new (and alas, last!)\r\nvolume of the “Prodromus.” Well, it must give you a huge sense of relief\r\nto have it off your hands; something like the relief I now feel at the\r\ntermination, at the close of thirty-one years, of my professorial\r\nduties, upon which you felicitate me. On account of a summer course of\r\ninstruction, which I felt bound to initiate for my successor, I did not\r\nreally close my labors until the end of July. Since then I have been\r\nable to work at systematic botany very steadily. We took, my wife and I,\r\na holiday of a fortnight, in which we visited friends on the Hudson\r\nRiver and its tributaries, at the close of September, just as the\r\nfoliage was beginning to display the bright autumnal tints, which this\r\nyear have been unusually gorgeous, and have not yet disappeared,\r\nalthough the leaves are now falling fast. The sight is most enjoyable to\r\nme in the earlier autumn, when the verdure still prevails and makes a\r\nsetting for the red, yellow, and russet.\r\n\r\nI am now deep in the Compositæ for the “California Flora” of my friend\r\nBrewer, and so am trying Bentham’s work. It generally holds\r\ngood,--wonderfully so, considering its extent, and the comparatively\r\nshort time he took for it.\r\n\r\nYour agreeable volume of “Miscellanies” is now in the hands of your old\r\nfriend and my neighbor, Jules Marcou; who asked to borrow it, having\r\nbeen unable to purchase a copy. It is reported out of print. I think I\r\nsent you a light article I wrote for the “Nation” last summer,--I\r\nbelieve in June,--in which I gave an abstract of your essay on the\r\nDominant Language of the Twentieth Century. It has attracted\r\nconsiderable attention. I see that those who have studied the subject\r\nthink that the increase of population in North America is not to go on\r\nat the rate it has been going; that the check is already apparent.\r\n\r\nA week or two ago appeared in the “Nation” an article (sent to you last\r\nweek by post), in which I had occasion to notice some other parts of\r\nyour volume, at considerable length. I have also been tempted to give\r\nsome account of your essay on Natural Selection as applied to man; but I\r\nfind it would take me too much out of my own line, and absorb time which\r\nI cannot spare. Indeed, I have only looked over that essay, and am not\r\nqualified to abstract, still less to criticise it. The longest article\r\nof the volume, which gives the title, I have not given as much attention\r\nto as I ought, probably, or I should perhaps value it more highly. But\r\nit seems to me that membership in scientific academies--the three you\r\ntake not excepted--is so largely affected by circumstance, irrespective\r\nof talent and of the value of work done, that one cannot very\r\nconfidently base general conclusions upon the data. Yet I have no great\r\nconfidence in my opinion. Anyway, the article is full of interesting\r\nmatters....\r\n\r\nWhat do you and Dr. Müller say to Bornet’s memoir, on the nature of\r\nlichens? His exposition is so clear that, if he is an honest and good\r\ninvestigator,--as I cannot well doubt,--his conclusions carry\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nMy sheet fills, and leaves now barely room for Mrs. Gray’s messages of\r\nkindest remembrances to yourself and to Madame De Candolle, in which I\r\nbeg to join. Long may you flourish, and much good work yet do. For one\r\nthing, pray print the list of botanical names!\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nNovember 26.\r\n\r\n... I am going this morning to witness the nuptials of my colleague and\r\nfriend Professor Sargent and a charming young lady of Boston; and, on\r\nthe chance of their having a day in Geneva, I wish to introduce the\r\nhappy couple to you and Madame De Candolle. They will tell you much of\r\nme, and of the satisfying and I trust useful sort of life I an now\r\nleading. Some evidence of renewed botanical activity in the form of a\r\ncouple of botanical papers just issued here, too bulky to send well by\r\npost, I will cause to reach you by way of Paris.\r\n\r\nProfessor Sargent is given to horticulture and arboriculture. He not\r\nonly takes charge of the university Botanic Garden, but also of a recent\r\nand noble foundation for an arboretum, from which much may in due time\r\nbe expected.\r\n\r\nIt is most pleasant and hopeful when, as in the present instance, a\r\nyoung man of means and best social position chooses to devote his time\r\nand energies to practical scientific ends, rather than to business or\r\npleasure. You are more accustomed to that at Geneva than we are here in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nI know that, before this can reach you, I shall have occasion to write\r\nto you, and to announce the reception of the last volume of the\r\n“Prodromus,” now on the way to me. So I have only to add that I am\r\nalways\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nMay 12, 1874.\r\n\r\n... I sent to Hooker to forward to you two articles in the “Nation,” on\r\nInsectivorous Plants, written to reclaim your work from Bennett, who\r\nbegan to appropriate it, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIt is already leading to discovery. A physician in Carolina, a good\r\nobserver, already writes me that in S. variolaris, the best of\r\nSarracenias, he thinks he finds the watery liquid anæsthetic (??) and\r\nthe sweet secretion not. But he says there is a line of sweet, a trail,\r\nrunning from the sweet rim down the edge of the wing outside nearly to\r\nthe ground, which lures up ants (with which Wyman tells me the pitchers\r\nare crowded), just like the train of Indian corn which hunters scatter\r\nalong the ground to lure wild turkeys into the trap! Does not that beat\r\nall!\r\n\r\nAlso my articles here resulted in the discovery related in the paper\r\ninclosed. The take-off of Thomson’s germs from another planet is good.\r\n\r\nJune 16.\r\n\r\n... The gratification I feel in learning (by yours of the 3d) that you\r\nare pleased must, I am sure, exceed any satisfaction of yours in regard\r\nto my subdued and quiet article in “Nature.”[94] Lockyer, to my great\r\nsurprise, applied to me for it, and of course I could not refuse. I\r\nthink it will generally be regarded by scientific people as just and\r\nmoderate.\r\n\r\nOdd that you should not have recognized my hand from the first in the\r\n“Insectivorous Plants,” written, in fact, to vindicate your rights. The\r\npapers called forth a second hoax, as elaborate as the first, and much\r\nbetter done. I have no idea who wrote them.\r\n\r\nYou must, meanwhile, have received the article in the “Nation,”\r\nreviewing Dr. Hodge’s “What is Darwinism?” You see what uphill work I\r\nhave in making a theist of you, “of good and respectable standing.”\r\n\r\nDo hurry up the book about Drosera, etc. My plants of Sarracenia\r\nvariolaris, having lost their spring growth in transmission, have not\r\nyet made any that is satisfactory. So I begged Dr. Mellichamp, who had\r\nsent me leaves with gorge sanded over at the sweet-secretion part, to\r\nsend some for the trail. He wrote me it was too late in the season; they\r\nwere all drying up. But this morning, with the inclosed postal card,\r\ncame several with the sand sticking fairly well to the glutinous line,\r\nand I send you one of them. I wish I could send you Mellichamp’s long\r\nletters, about the two sorts of larvæ, that appropriate, one the upper,\r\none the lower part of the pitcher.\r\n\r\nMy wife (who sends her love to you and yours) is much amused by your\r\nbackgammon reminiscence. For the year past we have a way of getting on\r\nmost peacefully. I sit by her side and play solitaire with two packs of\r\ncards, she looks on and helps, and when we don’t succeed there is nobody\r\nto “flare up” against but luck.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I think I never sent you my felicitations upon your election as\r\nForeign Honorary Member of American Academy Arts and Sciences.\r\n\r\nWe are proud to number you among the seventy-five (too many). And, I may\r\ntell you, only two negative votes were cast, one by an Academician who\r\nmade a speech on the occasion, to which nobody vouchsafed a word of\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nA. G.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 19, 1874.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--Your second letter reached me last evening, and this\r\nmorning came from the publishers some copies of the number of “Nature.”\r\nYou seem as pleased and are as ingenuous as a maiden when she first\r\nfinds out that she has an admirer!\r\n\r\nNow I am a little vexed, as I am apt to be when I let anything be\r\nprinted without reading the proof myself. Some one has doctored one\r\nsentence, and made it say the contrary to what I wrote, and to what is\r\ntrue; I make the reclamation on a separate sheet: and also another,\r\nwhich may be typographical, but which I am confident I could not have\r\nwritten; I surely wrote “_to_ many,” not “_in_ many.”\r\n\r\nMy claim for you about teleology I have made several times, in\r\n“Silliman’s Journal,”[95] and elsewhere. It is a matter on which I have\r\na good deal insisted.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nP. S.--My _point_ (which is _blunted_) was to show how very near Brown\r\ncame to “hitting the nail on the head” without hitting it, striking wild\r\ninstead!\r\n\r\nA. G.\r\n\r\nTO W. M. CANBY.\r\n\r\nJuly 6, 1874.\r\n\r\nI am glad if you have Darlingtonia in a state to examine. I have some\r\nyoung leaves growing, which show nothing yet. Mellichamp will send me a\r\npaper, which I will read at Hartford next month. Won’t you post up\r\nDarlingtonia also--getting what you can from Lemmon. He has not written\r\nto me about it. My young fish-tails show no exudation yet; and they are\r\ncolored like the rest of the leaf.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nBOTANIC GARDEN, July 8, 1874.\r\n\r\nDEAR CANBY,--Yours of 7th instant received. I thought you had live\r\nDarlingtonia. Of ours the old plant has died after starting three new\r\noffsets. But the growing leaves are small. If it goes on I may do\r\nsomething. Thus far I have detected no water in the tubes, nor any\r\nsticky secretion. But I shall slit one soon. Make notes for Hartford.\r\n\r\nYou have not guessed the conundrum, though you have made a step in\r\ndistinguishing the two different movements. I’ll tell you. It is to\r\nstrain out the small flies. Do you take? Or want details? I send you\r\nDarwin’s late letters,--one came this evening. We have lost all those\r\nPinguiculas.\r\n\r\nCan we get any from Wilmington now? Are there any near Dr. Mellichamp?\r\nYou may forward Darwin’s last letter to him and set him to\r\nobserving,--collecting and preserving leaves with insects stuck fast,\r\nand margin turned over. See if ours turn over the edge!\r\n\r\nHow does D. find out they digest?\r\n\r\nJuly 14.\r\n\r\nWhen Dionæa is irritated by a small fly, he has plenty of time to escape\r\nthrough the meshes, and the leaf soon opens, ready for better luck next\r\ntime. Think what a waste if the leaf had to go through all the process\r\nof secretion, etc., taking so much time, all for a little gnat. It would\r\nnot pay. Yet it would have to do it except for this arrangement to let\r\nthe little flies escape. But when a bigger one is caught he is sure for\r\na good dinner.\r\n\r\nThat is real Darwin. I just wonder you and never thought of it. But _he_\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nPretty good,--the solar protector! So Fendler is near you. Remember me\r\nto the good fellow.\r\n\r\nI wish he had let Cosmical Science alone! But now he never will, and is\r\na gone goose.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray, being sent away for a cough, made a journey to Apalachicola,\r\nFlorida, going by Washington, Augusta and Tallahassee, of which and his\r\nsuccessful search for Torreya he wrote a lively account for the\r\n“American Agriculturist,” republished in his “Scientific Papers,”\r\nselected by C. S. Sargent.\r\n\r\nHe was especially interested in seeing Torreya, a fine tree named for\r\nhis friend Dr. Torrey, which is only known in one or two localities in\r\nFlorida, on the banks of the Apalachicola River; and with some trouble\r\nhe found it growing, and had the satisfaction of hoping that it was\r\nvalued enough to be preserved. There is a second Torreya growing in\r\nJapan, a third Torreya in California, and a fourth in China. “But,” as\r\nDr. Gray says, “any species of very restricted range may be said to hold\r\nits existence by a precarious tenure. The known range of this species is\r\nnot more than a dozen miles in length along these bluffs, although Dr.\r\nChapman has heard of its growing farther south, where the bluff trends\r\naway from the river.”\r\n\r\nHe went to Stone Mountain in Georgia, a curiously bare, immense mass of\r\nstone, one side too steep to climb, but having in clefts some rare\r\nplants growing. From Chattanooga he made an excursion up Lookout\r\nMountain, interesting from its reminiscences of “Sherman’s March,” and\r\nalso the habitat of some rare plants he was so fortunate as to find.\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM M. CANBY.\r\n\r\nBOTANIC GARDEN, March 13, 1875.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CANBY,--I do not get on, and shall not in this melting snow and\r\nbad season.\r\n\r\nI yield to advice, and Mrs. Gray and I are going South,--I do not know\r\nwhere, but somewhere, taking my vacation now instead of in summer. I\r\nwant to find now--and reach comfortably--what we have here at the first\r\nof June.\r\n\r\nYou know somewhat of the South; I think I should like best to get to\r\nApalachicola and St. John’s River and see Torreya. But it seems far off.\r\n\r\nI want to recruit, and to be good for something, which at present I am\r\nnot!\r\n\r\nSMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,\r\nWASHINGTON, April 25, 1875.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CANBY,--Well, we have got back again, so far; and here, I think,\r\nwe shall stick for a few days. Had we anticipated so much cold and\r\nbackwardness, we should have stayed south longer.\r\n\r\nApalachicola was heavenly. But at Macon, coming north, we struck the\r\ncold wave; came on by Atlanta (Stone Mountain), Chattanooga (roots of\r\nSilene rotundifolia), and thence via Lynchburg straight here. I found\r\nTorreya, and had a good time with it. Lots of detail to tell you....\r\n\r\nI am lazy in traveling, or I would have written you. Then I have been\r\npretty busy, too, and have done several hard days’ work, causing much\r\nbut healthy fatigue.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, May 8.\r\n\r\nWe are at home, with delightful memories of you and yours.\r\n\r\nI think I hinted to you that I found two Crassulaceæ on Stone Mountain,\r\nboth annual.\r\n\r\nOne, most abundant on the lower slopes, is glaucous-green, and has\r\nbright white flowers. The pods show it to be a true Sedum. I send a\r\nsmall specimen. Note the blunt pods and short style. This--as shown by a\r\nbit of fruit in my herbarium--is Sedum pusillum, Michx.!\r\n\r\nThe other is dull purple in general hue, smaller, grows only well up the\r\nmountain, abounds in a small form on the very top, and is rather later;\r\nbut I make out the dehiscence, and it is Diamorpha pusilla, Nutt.!\r\n\r\nThe specimens you sent to me are this, larger and later than any I got.\r\nBut, as you directed me to the base of the mountain for Diamorpha, you\r\nmust have got this too. Your specimens have full-grown fruit. Look at\r\nthem and see if the larger ones have not the regular dehiscence down the\r\nside of Sedum, and let me know.\r\n\r\nMay 12, 1875.\r\n\r\nThanks for your letter and the Sedum.\r\n\r\nNow for another find. The moment I set eyes on the Arenaria of Stone\r\nMountain, I said, Ho! here is A. brevifolia, Nuttall, of which I had\r\nonly a single stalk in herbarium. Comparing now, I was right, and\r\nNuttall says his specimen is from Tatnall County (which is strange, that\r\nbeing in southeast Georgia). The question remains, Is it only a\r\nlow-country form of Arenaria glabra?\r\n\r\nYour specimen--with fruit--and M. A. Curtis’s[96] from the mountains of\r\nCarolina, being in the same state, compare pretty well. I should unite\r\nthem, only the seeds are different, Stone Mountain plant half the size,\r\nand shape rather different. But please rattle me out some real ripe\r\nseeds of your plant, for further comparison.\r\n\r\nAt Stone Mountain I looked rather for small specimens to match with A.\r\nbrevifolia. I send you a bit.\r\n\r\nI have sent the Sedum and Diamorpha yesterday to Paris, to compare and\r\nsee if both are in Herbarium Michaux.\r\n\r\nI am proud of my little discovery!\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 22, 1875.\r\n\r\nI must indulge, on its rising, the impulse to communicate with you,\r\nwhich a letter from Miss P. to my wife, just received, has awakened.\r\n\r\nIf I go on as I have been going, we shall come to know nothing of each\r\nother....\r\n\r\nShe will have told you of our loss in the death of Mrs. Loring. I never\r\nknew a woman fuller of charity, humility, and good works.\r\n\r\nIf there were time for a gossiping letter I or Mrs. Gray would give you\r\nsome account of a trip which we made to Florida this spring. An annoying\r\ncough, and a chronic catarrh,--the consequence of a trying winter,\r\nacting upon old susceptibilities,--distressed my friends more than it\r\ndid me. So, yielding to their solicitations, off we went, about the\r\nmiddle of March, to Washington, visiting old friends; to Augusta and\r\nSavannah, Georgia; and thence Apalachicola, a now almost deserted, but\r\nonce flourishing town, on the Gulf of Mexico. We met the spring in\r\nGeorgia; in Florida we were in early summer, about like our own middle\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThe botanizing was delicious, very many nice things which I had never\r\nseen growing before; our quarters comfortable, and the fare\r\nexceptionally excellent. East Florida, which has large hotels, was full\r\nof invalids and pleasure travelers, making a crowd not to our liking. I\r\nhad special botanical objects leading me to west Florida, an\r\nout-of-the-world region, where we had everything to ourselves. We were\r\nlate for the oranges, gleaning the last half dozen from the trees of our\r\nfriends. My throat is so sensitive that I dare say we shall need to go\r\nagain next March, and earlier than before. So, if you will arrange to\r\njoin us, I can promise you a pleasant time, and a real rest.\r\n\r\nOctober 11, 1875.\r\n\r\nWhat a capital article it is which your friend Lord Blachford has\r\npublished in the “Contemporary” for September, on Huxley’s Automata\r\nhypothesis!\r\n\r\nIt is long since I have read anything which pleased me more.\r\n\r\nDo you know who is P. C. W., in Article 6, of the same number? He makes\r\none suggestion of some value, that I some day want to follow up.\r\n\r\nI am grinding away at my work in the usual manner. We are just in the\r\nglory of the glowing autumnal foliage, and making ready for winter. If\r\nhealth holds out, here we expect to remain, at least till spring....\r\n\r\nTO G. FREDERICK WRIGHT.[97]\r\n\r\nBOTANIC GARDEN, July 1, 1875.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. WRIGHT,--Thanks for your letter. It may be that the time has\r\ncome in which a collection of my popular articles on Darwinism, etc.,\r\nwould be useful.[98] Your thinking so would go far to make me believe\r\nit. But then, you are one of the moderate number of people who have\r\ncarefully read them, and one of the few who well understand and\r\nappreciate them,--because you have given the subject an attentive\r\nconsideration,--and who are awake to the harm that comes from\r\ntheologians and ministers denouncing a view that scientific men are more\r\nand more receiving as probably true. I should like to know how Professor\r\nPark regards the proposition.\r\n\r\nI will say that while I am not unwilling to collect them for reprinting,\r\nin case they are called for, it would not quite do for me, in the\r\nposition I occupy (I mean as a man of science), to republish them in a\r\ncollected form, without entering anew and further into some of the\r\npending questions; to do which would seriously interrupt the legitimate\r\nwork which I have in hand, and to which I am deeply pledged. I suppose I\r\ncould add, and should be disposed to add, a note or two,--especially one\r\nupon teleology from a Darwinian point of view,--a subject upon which\r\nthere is something still to be said, though I do not see the way to say\r\nit conclusively. You will probably do it better than I ever can.\r\n\r\nAt present, I think I should let them alone, unless there comes what you\r\nministers recognize as a call for them, and such a call I should defer\r\nto.\r\n\r\nIf such as Professor Park and yourself were to ask it, I would see if a\r\npublisher could be got to take them up. But you don’t know how I dislike\r\nto have my name bruited about.\r\n\r\nDr. Peabody was very glad of the relief you gave him on Sunday week, and\r\nlike myself was greatly pleased with your thoughtful discourse.\r\n\r\nAugust 14, 1875.\r\n\r\n... The important thing to do, is to develop aright evolutionary\r\nteleology, and to present the argument for design from these exquisite\r\nadaptations in such a way as to make it tell on both sides; with\r\nChristian men, that they may be satisfied with, and perchance may learn\r\nto admire, Divine works effected step by step, if need be, in a system\r\nof nature; and the antitheistic people, to show that without the\r\nimplication of a superintending wisdom nothing is made out, and nothing\r\ncredible.\r\n\r\nNow for a month or two, I am pressed by daily technical work to the\r\nextreme, and get no chance to turn these matters over in my mind.\r\n\r\nI don’t want to handle this argument in such a way that it can be\r\ngainsaid, nor without touching the very point. May I ask you to help me?\r\nYou see how the question stands. How shall we best handle it?...\r\n\r\nSeptember 14, 1875.\r\n\r\n... I have been crowded and much absorbed with my part of the California\r\nbotany; get put back, by new collections, and have had the printer on my\r\nheels, which is not pleasant.\r\n\r\nI have to drive with all my might, and am not yet clear, though I trust\r\nthe worst is past. I get so fagged that when I sit down to Darwin’s\r\n“Insectivorous Plants,” by way of relaxation, of an evening, I fall\r\nasleep over it. And so have not finished that book yet, as it cannot be\r\nread with the eyes shut. I put off thought of all but my daily work till\r\nmy task is done.\r\n\r\nI thought I might have got up to see you, but I cannot now.\r\n\r\nI see in the last “Nation” an article, which was evidently to have been\r\ncontinued, by Chauncey Wright, in which he points out clearly the\r\nessential difference between Darwinism, which is scientific, and\r\nSpencerism, which is “philosophical.” Save the mark!\r\n\r\nPoor Wright,--your namesake--died suddenly of apoplexy, Sunday morning.\r\nHe was a stanch Millite, and very acute and clear-headed.\r\n\r\nSeptember 15.\r\n\r\n... A minister out in Illinois has written me, taking me seriously to\r\ntask for altering my opinion after the age of forty-five, and for\r\nabetting disorder, by supporting theories that disturb the harmony of\r\nopinion that ought to prevail among scientific men.\r\n\r\nHe is one of those people who think that if you shut your eyes hard, it\r\nwill answer every purpose; indeed, from the ease with which he confutes\r\nDarwinism, I suppose he finds no call even to shut his eyes.\r\n\r\nNovember 10.\r\n\r\n... Species, as I have said (in “Silliman’s Journal” articles) are not\r\nfacts or things, but judgments, and, of course, fallible judgments; how\r\nfallible the working naturalist knows and feels more than any one else.\r\n\r\nThat the pages of a Flora or Fauna should give the idea of fixity and\r\nclear limitation which does not well or wholly represent the reality, is\r\nnatural enough; is, indeed, inevitable. The object in these works is to\r\nset forth the differences, and put them in the strongest and clearest\r\nlight, so that the forms may be readily discriminated. The nearer two\r\nforms are alike, the more pains the naturalist takes to set forth the\r\ndifferences, while the likeness “goes without saying,” and is therefore\r\noverlooked by the outsider, though it may have been almost an even\r\nchance that the describer merged the two in one.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful and experienced naturalist does not get a wrong\r\nimpression from all this, but the outsider almost certainly will.\r\n\r\nA. G.\r\n\r\nJanuary 14, 1876.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. WRIGHT,--Thanks for your line of the 8th.\r\n\r\nBy this week’s “Nation,”[99] you see that, long as the talk is, I have\r\nnot yet touched the critical question, nor have I yet got an opportunity\r\nto apply myself to it. But I hope to do so soon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the number of the “Westminster Review,” which you called my\r\nattention to, has passed through my hands in our book club, and I shall\r\nsoon have it in my hands again. It makes a very strong presentation, and\r\nthe question is, how its points are to be met on purely scientific\r\ngrounds. If I can meet them fairly, and reëstablish the evidence of\r\ndesign on the basis it ought to stand upon, I shall be satisfied and\r\nhappy. Anyway, it is a help to me to have this able presentation brought\r\nbefore me....\r\n\r\nMay 21.\r\n\r\n...I have here and there seen references to St. Augustine as maintaining\r\nviews of indirect creation, such as now would be termed, or might be\r\ntermed, evolutionary. Can you conveniently put me in the way of\r\nunderstanding his ideas? It is matter for you to work up in your article\r\non Calvinism and Evolution....\r\n\r\nDecember 20.\r\n\r\n... Do you see No. 1 of the new agnostic weekly, “Evolution,” and its\r\nreview of “Darwiniana”? It insists that such a world as ours is too full\r\nof imperfections to have had any intellectual originator....\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. REDFIELD.\r\n\r\nJuly 1, 1876.\r\n\r\nDEAR REDFIELD,--I doubt if you know that the late John Stuart Mill, the\r\nphilosopher, was a keen botanist. His herbarium, rich in European plants\r\nand with a good many Indian, etc. (small specimens from Royle, etc.),\r\nwas given by his stepdaughter to Kew. But Hooker asked leave, after\r\ntaking a certain amount, to present the rest to me, with leave to choose\r\nwhere all I did not care to have incorporated in the herbarium here\r\nshould go to. I think it should go to a public herbarium, and as I think\r\nthe Academy’s is not supplied well with European species of at all\r\nrecent date, or recent collecting, perhaps it should go to you....\r\n\r\nTO MRS. GRAY.\r\n\r\nJune 11, 1876.\r\n\r\n... To get my train yesterday I had to leave the house at one. Dom Pedro\r\ntill sixteen minutes of that, with Eliot, A. Agassiz, and two\r\nBrazilians. They came to the house, the door being open, and I received\r\nthem in the library.... Sargent was with me to take him off my hands\r\nwhen I had to go. We treated him as we should any gentleman, though I\r\nbelieve I once addressed him as Your Majesty when flourishing the\r\npoison-bottle under his nose. He is a large, square-built, good-looking\r\nman of about my age, I think. Never did I have more questions to answer\r\nin ten minutes, nor questions more direct and to the point. Taken into\r\nthe herbarium, he recognized what it was, complimented me by saying that\r\nmy name was a well-known one (I suppose Agassiz had put him up to that),\r\nand I returned by saying that, in at least one case, we were members of\r\nthe same botanical society.\r\n\r\n“How many species of plants have you specimens of?” About 65,000.\r\n\r\n“How do you arrange them?” Cases opened, and I began to show him.\r\n\r\n“Please let me see some plant.”\r\n\r\nI pulled out the genus cover first at hand, which happened to be\r\nEuropean Saxifrages; opened. He took up a sheet.\r\n\r\n“Saxifraga irrigua, European. I do not want to see plants of Europe. Let\r\nme see an American plant.”\r\n\r\nI took another cover and showed Saxifraga peltata of California.\r\n\r\n“Have you Sage-brush?” Yes.\r\n\r\n“Let me see Sage-brush.”\r\n\r\nI took him across the room to the Artemisias, and showed him, first, the\r\none he saw so much of en route to California; second, the northern one\r\nto which Lewis and Clark gave the name at first.\r\n\r\n“How do you prevent insects from destroying them?” They are all\r\npoisoned.\r\n\r\n“What do you poison with?” Corrosive sublimate dissolved in alcohol.\r\n\r\n“How do you use it?”\r\n\r\nHere I ran off and brought back the poison-bottle, and applied the\r\nliquid to a specimen under the imperial nose.\r\n\r\nI then ran off to set down the bottle in a safe place on the middle\r\ntable, when he followed me up and asked:\r\n\r\n“How strong do you make the solution?”\r\n\r\nI gave him the answer as well as I could, when he turned to one of his\r\nsuite:--\r\n\r\n“Please write that down.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was done accordingly. In the library I had displayed, enough to\r\nattract the eye, the bound volumes of “Flora Brasiliensis,” which he\r\nglanced at, and asked:--\r\n\r\n“Have you the work on the botany of the vicinity of Rio Janeiro?”\r\n\r\nI answered, Yes, thanks to Mr. Agassiz,--to whom the emperor had given\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut he seemed uneasy until he saw it, and I put two of the folio volumes\r\ninto his hands, which seemed to satisfy him.\r\n\r\nThen, as he was passing on to the lecture-room, I slipped off. At head\r\nof Common, in Boston, I met C., who told me Dom Pedro was down at his\r\nmuseum at 7½ A.M. C. was not going to Hunnewell’s....\r\n\r\nI amused them with the account of the conversation with the emperor.\r\n\r\nThe rhododendrons, and azaleas too, most splendid. Nothing like it at\r\nPhiladelphia. The best as well as the most he ever had....\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nAugust 3, 1876.\r\n\r\nIt is very good of you to write to me. I was about to drop you a line by\r\nthe next post, when yours of the 21st came in.\r\n\r\nMy special object was to tell you that I have just had addressed to you,\r\nthrough the New York publishers, a little book, made up of scattered\r\npapers on Darwinian topics, which some of my friends thought it might be\r\nuseful to collect. I somewhat mistrust their judgment, but have yielded\r\nto their request. There is nothing new in the volume, except a short\r\nessay on the hypothetical duration of species, and a rather long one at\r\nthe end, upon teleology as affected by evolution, which I should be glad\r\nto have you read, and should like to know whether you think it hits the\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nI have no idea who P. C. W. and the Westminster Reviewer may be, but I\r\nsuspect they are one and the same. If you should know, please inform\r\nme.... Yes, it has been warm enough, and it was unceasingly so for\r\ntwelve days. Mrs. Gray rushed to the seashore at Beverly; but I mainly\r\nstayed at home, kept out of the sun all I could, and rather enjoyed the\r\nheat than otherwise. But at the end I broke down; came all at once upon\r\nthe novel sensation of being an old man. And so we hastened up and\r\nconcluded an arrangement which had been left loosely and vaguely under\r\nconsideration, viz., to revisit for myself, and to introduce Mrs. Gray\r\nto, the higher Alleghanies in Virginia, Carolina, and Tennessee, where I\r\nused to roam and botanize more than thirty years ago. We expect to set\r\nout in two or three weeks. It is not Switzerland, but it is a region of\r\nmountains, dells, and rills, and forests, which I have been longing to\r\nrevisit. Oh, that you could be with us! Two botanists will join us at\r\nPhiladelphia, and perhaps a third.\r\n\r\nAmong the very few copies of my “Darwiniana” which I have sent to\r\nEngland is one to the editor of the “Spectator,” whose ideas fit in with\r\nmine well, as I judge from reading the paper regularly. Do you know him?\r\nHe is a very broad churchman.\r\n\r\nI am just beginning to print a portion of my new “Flora of North\r\nAmerica.” There can be no going to Europe for me till this volume or\r\nhalf volume is off my hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray enjoyed greatly the journey through the North Carolina\r\nmountains, and the traveling and accommodations were almost as rough as\r\nin the journeys thirty-three and thirty-five years before. The people,\r\nstill cut off from the lower lands by roads that were mostly only used\r\nfor horses, and where one traveled sometimes two or three days without\r\nmeeting a wheeled vehicle, were very plain and primitive in their ways,\r\nand one had to depend at times on their hospitality for accommodations.\r\nBut the scenery is striking and beautiful, and the forest unsurpassed\r\nfor the magnificence of its grand trees, rich in variety and beauty. The\r\nparty went first to New River Springs, then to the French Broad Hot\r\nSprings, and round by a rough journey to Asheville, then far away from\r\nrailroads, where they were joined by Dr. and Mrs. Engelmann, and\r\ncontinued through the mountains to Cesar’s Head, whence they made their\r\nway by railroad through South Carolina and Georgia to Jonesboro; from\r\nJonesboro going up Roan Mountain, a camping-out excursion.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nDecember 5, 1876.\r\n\r\n... Curious that one species should take pains to close fertilize some\r\nflowers, the other to cross all....\r\n\r\nNow I want to beg of you to consider about a name for this kind of\r\nthing, on which, as a good judge, you could consult Bentham, or indeed,\r\nHooker, if he can give it attention.\r\n\r\nThis matter will need to come into generic or specific characters, and\r\ntherefore wants a terse and unambiguous mode of expression in a single\r\nword.\r\n\r\nMy old expression thirty or so years ago, “diœciodimorphous,” you\r\nreasonably objected to, implying separation of sexes (which, though, it\r\nneed not do).\r\n\r\nYours of “dimorphous” should be, as the lawyers say, void for vagueness,\r\nthere being plenty of other kinds of dimorphism in flowers.\r\n\r\nHildebrand’s, of “heterostylous,” the difference being in other things\r\nas well as style, and, I think, possible sometimes not in the style. The\r\nterm will not work well in characters, whether in Latin or English. I\r\nhave proposed, accordingly, in a little article not yet published, to\r\nuse the term “heterogone,” in other form “heterogonous,” in Latin\r\n“Flores heterogoni,” with the counterpart “homogone,” “homogonous,”\r\n“Flores homogoni.”\r\n\r\nThis means, you see, explicitly, diverse genitalia, and the [Greek:\r\ngonê] is used as in the common botanical term “perigonium.”\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nFebruary 5, 1877.\r\n\r\nYour friend Lord Blachford is an unrivaled expositor. I have just been\r\nreading, with extreme satisfaction, his article on the Reality of Duty.\r\nThat naturally brought you to mind, and I vowed I would no longer be so\r\nnegligent, but would acknowledge and thank you for your letter of August\r\nlast, and for Professor Mozley’s sermons. They are excellent indeed, and\r\nit is saddening to have a man of such insight laid aside by illness, of\r\na sort which probably does not diminish his desire, but destroys his\r\npower, to work....\r\n\r\nI think Mrs. Gray has given some account of our summer vacation. I long\r\nto revisit those mountains when the Rhododendrons and Kalmias are in\r\nbloom, and to have your company.\r\n\r\nWe are just home, Mrs. Gray and I, from a fortnight with our friends at\r\nWashington,--a pleasant holiday, which of late I have always had at this\r\nseason, the time of the annual meeting of the regents of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, of which I am one of the lay (i. e., non-congressional)\r\nmembers. It makes a break in the monotony of our winter, which is far\r\nmilder there than in New England, and the society at Washington is very\r\npleasant. More and more men of mark, and intelligence, and cultivation\r\nreside there, at least for the winter months. We left on the day when\r\nthe contested electoral count began, under the arrangement so happily\r\nand hopefully adopted. There is no excitement, and, outside of\r\npartisanship, little care which way it is determined, but much that it\r\nshall be legitimately determined by evidence, argument, and a decisive\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nI am deep in routine botanical work, and with a printer not far behind\r\nme, I can think of little else.\r\n\r\nTO G. FREDERICK WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 6, 1877.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. WRIGHT,--What can I ever have said or written which President\r\nFairchild takes to mean that I have the preposterous idea that “changes\r\nof environment take place in distinct and definite lines”! He may well\r\nask if “this is not contrary to all evidence.” Even the conception that\r\nvariation takes place in definite, or at least not in indefinite, lines\r\nis an idea which is rather thrown out as tenable, and as inferable from\r\na good many facts, than as anything to swear by. I think so, yet, I am\r\nsorry to say, it is no part of Darwinism, pure and simple.\r\n\r\nNow, in my turn, what does President F. mean by his “mere fact” “species\r\nexist”? That seems to me no fact at all, but an inference. Individuals\r\nexist; species are inferred from the relations the individuals are\r\nobserved to sustain to each other. That species are distinct, in the\r\nsense of none blending, is what working naturalists would like to have\r\nsomebody settle for them in many a troublesome case. That they always\r\nhave been as much so as they are now is the question under\r\nconsideration....\r\n\r\nMay 24.\r\n\r\n... Now we can’t go to see you, sorry to say. The reason is, that I am\r\nworking against time. Hooker is coming over, and we are going in summer\r\nto the Rocky Mountains together, according to an old promise of mine. To\r\ndo it I ought to complete the printing of the part of my “Flora” which I\r\nam upon, else I shall suffer in various ways, and there is great danger\r\nthat I fail.\r\n\r\n... Do you notice--I know it will please you--how Kingsley caught at my\r\nessay, which was reprinted in England long ago; see his memoirs.\r\n\r\n1877.\r\n\r\nI would say to President Fairchild something like this:\r\n\r\nWhere only one individual out of a thousand or a million can survive to\r\nmaturity and propagation, clearly only the very best adapted to the\r\nenvironment will so survive; and in somewhat different environments,\r\nonly those best adapted respectively to the two, three, or more\r\ndifferent environments. The intermediates, i. e., those least\r\nparticularly adapted to the two or three different emergencies, surely\r\nhave least chance.\r\n\r\nNow our species of plants and animals are the comparatively few\r\nsurviving lines of a great number of lines which have come down through\r\nlong and various periods of great tribulation, in the literal sense of\r\nthe word; they have been ground over and over, first on this trial, then\r\non that, leaving, as it seems to me, no chance of the survival, side by\r\nside, of all sorts and shades of intermediate forms. Hence, under this,\r\nand the general law of heredity, the practical distinction of species\r\nand genera appears to be a natural result.\r\n\r\nThat low, and even the lowest, forms of life should survive and abound\r\nall down the ages, and be the most widely diffused over the earth, seems\r\nalso the most natural result, being simple adaptations to simplest\r\nconditions of air and water, so nearly the same the world over. These\r\nare still far most numerous in individuals, and have, so to say, the\r\nsurest hold on life. When we think of the vast void below which the\r\n“improvement” out of their sphere of these would leave, and the\r\nincreased risks which complicated structure (in machines or beings) has\r\nto run, we shall not wonder that the simple still numerically\r\npredominate.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 10, 1877.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. DARWIN,--Except when you are to be aided in your work I\r\ndecline to give letters of introduction to you, knowing how you are\r\noccupied and how infirm your health at any time may be. So please take\r\nthis note to mean just this. The happy couple who bear it would be\r\ndelighted to call some day, if you say so, and pay their respects to\r\nyou, and I will tell you why I am disposed to promote their wishes.\r\n\r\nMr. Burgess[100] was a favorite pupil of mine, and is a young naturalist\r\nof much promise; not in my department, however, but in entomology. He\r\ntakes particularly to the anatomy of insects, draws capitally, and shows\r\ntalent for research, which we trust will bring forth good fruit. I\r\ncannot blame him if his modesty and caution have kept him back from\r\npublication as yet, but he has time before him, and even a sight of you\r\nwill be a stimulus to his ambition as well as something to remember in\r\nafter years. I need not say that he takes to Evolution; all young\r\nnaturalists of any good do. He has just married the daughter of my dear\r\nold friend, the late Mr. Sullivant, who did for muscology in this\r\ncountry more than one man is likely ever to do again. The young lady is\r\nvery dear to your good friend Mrs. Gray and to me; and, as you have more\r\nthan once made a remark complimentary to American ladies, and as you\r\nare such an excellent judge, I must even give you the opportunity of\r\nextending your range of instances.\r\n\r\nBut please do not give our young friends the opportunity of calling upon\r\nyou, unless it quite suits you.\r\n\r\nBy the time this reaches you, Dr. Hooker will be on the way to us, we\r\nexpect, and we are looking to have a great run together over the Rocky\r\nMountains, and perhaps across the Continent. Wherever we may be, you may\r\nbelieve me,\r\n\r\nAlways yours cordially,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 4, 1877.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE: ... I meant to have a good portion of my\r\n“Synoptical Flora of North America” to send you this summer; but it will\r\nnot be quite ready at the time I expected, and I am now likely not to\r\nhave this summer for writing, but rather for observation over a\r\nconsiderable range of country. Dr. Hooker, it seems now almost certain,\r\nis coming over in a month from now. Dr. Hayden has invited him and me to\r\njoin his expedition of exploration this year, or rather to make a survey\r\nof much of his ground in the Rocky Mountains; and it is possible we may\r\neven reach California. I am rather old for this work, but judging from\r\nlast year, I may well endure and enjoy it. Would that you could join us!\r\n\r\nWe are in essential accord as to subgenus and its nomenclature. Your\r\nletter to Cogniaux discusses and decides--as I had done for myself--the\r\nquestions propounded. You will see I follow it out consistently in my\r\npart of botany of California, while Watson was at sea in his, and would\r\nhardly be convinced by my arguments. But he tells me he is convinced by\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nOctober 19.\r\n\r\n... Our journey of ten and a half weeks, with Hooker, was a most\r\nenjoyable one, every way prosperous, but laborious. Colorado to the\r\nborders of New Mexico, a little of Utah and the Wahsatch mountains, and\r\nextensive traveling in California, as far south as Monterey, and north\r\nto Mt. Shasta. On return, I had Hooker’s copious collections to name up.\r\nI made only small and special collections, and most busy we were kept\r\ntill, on the 6th inst., I put Hooker on the steamer, which, as telegraph\r\ntells us, only yesterday reached Queenstown, so he will be landing at\r\nLiverpool to-day,--a full fortnight from Boston to London. I am now busy\r\nenough with bringing up arrears of correspondence and affairs, and\r\nstudying some collections which will not wait. Only by the end of this\r\nmonth shall I get to resume my regular, but long, interrupted work. Mrs.\r\nGray accompanied us, and enjoyed it much, enduring well the occasional\r\ncamp life and such hardship as there was. You should come over, and we\r\nwill repeat the journey, but only three years hence. Much as I should\r\nenjoy it, I cannot spare the time sooner.\r\n\r\nI found myself quite equal to younger people in mountain climbing....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 4, 1877.\r\n\r\nDEAR OLD E.,--Never mind if you are seventy; Hooker is sixty, and I am\r\nbetween, and we are lively yet.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we young fellows may knock about rather faster than you like,\r\nwanting to do much in a little time. But then, you need not do so much\r\nin Colorado as we; take the easy part.... I shall be sorry if you fail\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWe must twine in Cuscuta, as we twine in the rest of the book. For real\r\naccuracy we must finally come to the terms I propose, entropic and\r\nantitropic. We can’t get watch-hands into a good form for the\r\ndescription of order, genus, etc.\r\n\r\nBe sure I’ll keep you posted. Should like to go to Iron Mountain.\r\n\r\nWAITING ON RAILROAD FROM CAÑON CITY\r\nTO PUEBLO, July 21, 1877.\r\n\r\n... If this flowering Euphorbia is the one you asked for I have made\r\ngood specimens. The round-leaved one is on the hills, and is not yet\r\nout; is not the one, I am sure.\r\n\r\nWe had yesterday a good day (with Brandegee)[101] at the Arkansas Cañon;\r\nit is grand, surely.\r\n\r\nTo-day Hooker and the Stracheys drive across and down Wet Mountain\r\nValley to La Veta (two long days), while we, Mrs. Gray, Dr. Hayden, and\r\nI, return by railroad to Pueblo, and thence to La Veta, by sunset\r\nto-day. To-morrow up to a camp on La Veta Pass of Sangre de Christo\r\nMountains, which Captain Stevenson is preparing.\r\n\r\nOur English friends begin already to feel in a hurry, and for a wonder I\r\nam the hold-back member of the party....\r\n\r\nSALT LAKE, August 8.\r\n\r\nI have yours of the 30th July, and I return inclosure. Write hereafter\r\nto the Palace Hotel, San Francisco.\r\n\r\nI trust, and expect, that the strike days are over, and that you will\r\nseverely punish the ringleaders.[102] Glad you have had nice weather;\r\nbut you have no air like that of Colorado and Utah....\r\n\r\nWell, much as we miss and want you, yet we should have hurried you too\r\nmuch. We want to go over a good deal of ground cursorily, rather than a\r\nlittle thoroughly and leisurely.\r\n\r\nI do not write you about the oaks at Cañon City, because we had nothing\r\nnew to say. We agree with you in the complete running together of the\r\noaks down to Undulata. There is one very large-leaved state, looking\r\nvery different; but it is mostly on fast-growing shoots, and no doubt is\r\na state of the “Q. alba, var.” of Torrey. “Alba” indeed! But we did not\r\nfind the entire-leaved form at the cañon, and Brandegee said it occurred\r\nonly at the mouth of the cañon, and near the city.\r\n\r\nFrom Cañon City we--Mrs. Gray, Hayden, and I--went in one day south to\r\nLa Veta by rail, and the next day, toward evening, up to La Veta Pass,\r\n10,300 feet, and over and 300 feet or so lower, where we camped, nice\r\ntents having been provided by Fort Lyon en route, and other furnishings\r\nfrom Fort Garland. Abies concolor abounded, though there was more of A.\r\nMenziesii (Picea pungens) and Pinus contorta, and a good amount of P.\r\naristata and P. flexilis. The A. Menziesii at that elevation is less\r\nprickly, sometimes almost as soft as A. Douglasii to the touch, and\r\ncones inclined to be shorter. The result is, we think we can trace A.\r\nEngelmanni into A. Menziesii. What say you to that?\r\n\r\nBotanizing up there and in Sangre de Christo Pass good, but only\r\nmoderate; nothing new, and no great variety. We enjoyed camp life very\r\nwell; but after three days broke up, and went over to Fort Garland, and\r\nthence, while the ladies and General Strachey went off to a Mexican\r\nvillage, we had a two days’ trip up the Sierra Blanca. Alpine plants the\r\nsame as on Gray’s Peak, but scanty, owing to more southern latitude and\r\ngreater dryness. A longer time and a searching of the interior of this\r\nvery rough range might, and doubtless would, furnish much we did not\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nReturning from Fort Garland to the railroad, we went back to Colorado\r\nSprings and drove up to Manitou. Next day, we went up Ute\r\nPass--nothing--and looked about. Next day, to Garden of the Gods, to\r\nGeneral Palmer’s to early dinner, and thence to railroad and to Denver.\r\nNext day, Denver. Next by railroad through Clear Creek Cañon and to\r\nGeorgetown, or within a mile, and thence up to Kelso’s Cabin, now a\r\nwell-kept house, to sleep. Next day, Gray’s Peak, and I crossed over to\r\nthe top of Torrey’s. Next day, after morning botanizing, came down to\r\nGeorgetown and visited Empire City and the Pecks. Next day, Sunday, a\r\nrestful morning, and then by rail back to Denver in the afternoon and\r\nevening. Monday, off at half past seven to Cheyenne, and after dinner\r\ntook railroad to Ogden, and came up here last evening. To-day, a broken\r\nday, sight-seeing, etc. To-morrow, we, or some of us, are going south to\r\nAmerican Fork Cañon; up that and over the pass into Cottonwood Cañon;\r\ndown that, and back here, in time to go on that afternoon to Ogden and\r\nthence west to Reno, thence Virginia City, Carson, etc., and the Groves,\r\nYosemite, etc. We shall see, and I will let you know.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gray is out with the party, to see things, and Brigham Young. _I\r\nwill not._ She would be sending love to Mrs. Engelmann and you, if here.\r\nShe is very well, and enjoying this travel hugely. I am strong, and ever\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nYOSEMITE, CAL., August 21, 1877.\r\n\r\n... So long without touching a pen I can hardly form letters. Did I\r\nwrite to you from Utah? We left direct route at Reno, went to Carson\r\nCity, with détour to Virginia City,--queer place; first got hold of\r\nPinus monophylla, but there no fruit.\r\n\r\nHired conveyance to take us from Carson right across the Sierra Nevada\r\nvia Silver Mountain to Calaveras Big Trees,--a good way for studying the\r\ntree vegetation, and other, only all other is mainly destroyed by\r\ndrought and sheep, and the ground is powdered dust. As we struck Pinus\r\nponderosa we were struck with more tapering shape of tree and longer\r\nleaves than that of Colorado, so different, and soon, as we rose, by the\r\nimmense size of cone, ovate, six inches long, very heavy. The big-cone\r\nponderosa has less bright green and rather longer leaves, and cones\r\nlooking quite different from the ordinary Californian ponderosa, which\r\ngrows intermixed, except at the higher levels, and has long but narrow\r\ncones. Losing the big one as we descended to Calaveras, we come on it\r\nagain in the Sierra here, when we get up to seven thousand to eight\r\nthousand feet. Here it passes for P. Jaffreyi or Jeffreyi. Is it so? Is\r\nit distinct? On bare side of Silver Mountain we found P. monophylla with\r\ncones, both maturing and this year’s....\r\n\r\nCHICO, September 5, 1877.\r\n\r\n... Thanks for your letter to San Francisco. We are keeping lively; are\r\non the way to Shasta.\r\n\r\nWhat if we were to return via St. Louis: will you insure us against\r\nmalaria and fever? Want to talk Coniferæ with you....\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, September 24, 1877.\r\n\r\nWe are just back via Niagara; Hooker and I via New York, and the former\r\nhaving the Sunday with Eaton at New Haven. All well and happy to get\r\nhome after a prosperous and, as you may imagine, laborious journey of\r\nten and a half weeks. The trip to Shasta involved long stagecoach\r\njourneys, but they were most interesting. Returning to Sacramento we\r\nwent on to Truckee, where Lemmon[103] joined us by appointment. We gave\r\none day to Mount Stanford and one to Tahoe, then took the overland train\r\nas it came on at midnight, and thence had no stationary bed till we\r\nreached Niagara. And we live to tell the story!\r\n\r\nI want to tell you what we are led to think about Firs and Spruces. I\r\nwill give in this my own opinions, which lie yet open, but are likely to\r\nsettle down, except you convince me to the contrary on some points.\r\nHooker comes to the same conclusions or nearly, but I will keep to my\r\nown only in this letter, and ask what you think of them, off-hand. Your\r\nreply will come to hand before Sir Joseph sails....\r\n\r\nSome day you must have a picture of our camp on La Veta Pass. I wish\r\nthere could have been one of the Shasta camp of the Bidwells.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, September 27, 1877.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DARWIN,--Returning from our ten and a half weeks of travel,\r\nwhich has been every way prospered and pleasant, I find your book.[104]\r\nI can now barely thank you for it, and for the great compliment of the\r\ndedication. I must not open it till Hooker leaves me, a week hence, the\r\nwork we have to do before we part being so great and pressing. Then I\r\nshall turn to it, with enjoyment, and as soon as I can find time I must\r\nnotice or review it.\r\n\r\nHooker sends his love; is very glad Cohn has taken up your son’s\r\nexperiments on Dipsacus, which reminds me to send my best thanks to him\r\nfor the copy addressed to me. For perusal, even for a glance, that, too,\r\nmust wait till we have worked up the collections and observations we\r\nhave made in our journey to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLet me add, being sure of your sympathy, that our poor dog Max\r\npeacefully breathed his last to-day, after a happy life of twelve or\r\nthirteen years. We are glad he lived till we returned, and greeted us\r\nwith his absorbing and touching affection. In a few days came a partial\r\nparalysis, some convulsions, and then a quiet and seemingly painless\r\nending. He is immortalized in your book on Expression, and will live in\r\nthe memory of his attached master and mistress.\r\n\r\nMax was a black and tan terrier, not remarkable in any way for beauty or\r\nintelligence, but interesting from his warm affection and the power it\r\nhad in developing his intelligence. To be near and to please his beloved\r\nmaster was enough for him. Anything his master did was right and to be\r\nsubmitted to. Max had conscience, but it did not restrain him from\r\nshowing his vexation when left at home, by throwing Dr. Gray’s hat and\r\ngloves, etc., on the floor; but his shame and penitence always betrayed\r\nhim. It seemed as if the joy of his master’s return had killed him.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray’s next pet was a very small puppy; so small that for the first\r\nfew months Dr. Gray would drop him into his pocket when calling on\r\ncertain friends. He was said to be a Japanese terrier, and grew to be a\r\ngreat beauty, with long, white, curling hair (with some black markings)\r\nto the tips of his ears and toes, and a tail like a plume, curling over\r\nhis back, all so fluffy he was given the name of Puff. Dr. Gray always\r\ncalled him a “little pagan dog,” because, he said, his conscience was so\r\nunequally developed. But though willful and obstinate, with great\r\nself-sufficiency, he was very attractive. It was a piece of his mischief\r\nas a puppy that called out the following letter from his master to Rev.\r\nG. F. Wright.\r\n\r\nTO G. FREDERICK WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 11, 1878.\r\n\r\nREV. SIR,--Will you be so good as to accept a puppy’s penitent apologies\r\nfor his naughtiness, and a new pair of rubbers in place of those which I\r\nwickedly destroyed, because it was “my nature to” at the time you last\r\nvisited my master. I wish you to know that I am as sorry for it as I am\r\ncapable of being, that I have been punished as well as scolded, and\r\nthat the cost of the rubbers has been stopped out of my allowance.\r\n\r\nSo no more at present from your disobedient,\r\n\r\nJAP. PUFF.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray’s last dog was a beautiful spaniel, and had the same devoted\r\nlove for him. He was very courteous and polite, and gentle and\r\naffectionate. He needed a great deal of outdoor exercise, and was so\r\ndisconsolate and miserable at his master’s illness, that he was sent to\r\nkind friends, where he still keeps a warm and loving greeting for his\r\nold mistress.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 26, 1877.\r\n\r\nDid I dispatch a line to you on or about October 1st,--one which would\r\nhave crossed your last to me? If I did not, it shows how a continual and\r\nfixed intention works a sense of performance.\r\n\r\nI took with me, on our travels, your letter of June 20, expecting to\r\nwrite you from the Rocky Mountains or some far-away Pacific region. But\r\nnever were such busy people as Hooker and I the whole time. In fact, I\r\nwas bound to make Hooker see just as much as possible within our limited\r\ntime, and it seemed on the whole best for us to see very much in\r\nglimpses and snatches rather than far less more leisurely and\r\nthoroughly. He will have told you of our over nine thousand miles of\r\ntravel together, and of how he liked it. I think Mrs. Gray and I enjoyed\r\nit most, and that we have a particular fancy for hurry-skurry\r\njourneying. We should like to do it all over, and more. But especially\r\nwe should like to see California, in green attire. Not that we are not\r\ninterested and taken with the sere aspect of these western regions in\r\nsummer, which we fancy more than Hooker does. In fact, the greenness of\r\nEngland is so congenial to him that he took more delight in our eastern\r\nStates, which he had mere glimpses of, than in all the wide western\r\nregion, though of course there was more to learn in these.\r\n\r\nHow I wish you could have been of the party! We dream of doing some\r\nparts again, and of going both farther south and north, three years\r\nhence. You and Sir Joseph would not then be too old. But I can hardly\r\nexpect then to be, as last summer, one of the most active and frisky\r\nmembers of the party.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the cost in time is more than one counts on. From the middle\r\nof July to the end of September, one may, once in a way, fairly devote\r\nto holidaying. But then, after a week or two of work with Hooker over\r\nour notes and collections, I had to bring up long arrears, which I\r\nshould have kept in hand if I had stayed at home, and so I have only now\r\nof late come to take up my regular work where I left it in July.\r\n\r\nIf you do not hear enough of our summer’s doings from Hooker,--and I\r\nknow he must be busy indeed,--we must get Mrs. Gray to write a\r\nnarrative; not that she is not also a busy soul.\r\n\r\nAll this time you have had anxious events to occupy your minds, and\r\nthese are not yet over. But at home you are happy in the recovering\r\nhealth of your daughter after so long suffering.\r\n\r\nWe had our usual Christmas gathering last evening, and the house is only\r\nnow set to rights again. Your old friends Miss P. and K. L. were with\r\nus, and we spoke of you. The latter told us that Miss S. proposes to\r\ncome to us from the West Indies, I suppose in early summer, and glad we\r\nshall be to see her.\r\n\r\nYou never sent me your Middle Ages book; the publishers’ fault, no\r\ndoubt, which I beg you will urge them to make up for....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT\r\nMay 20, 1878.\r\n\r\n... That enlarged photograph[105] is for you, to be left for your St.\r\nLouis Academy of Sciences, if it ever gets a home, or for the Hortus\r\nBotanicus Missouriensis, as you elect. Glad you value it.\r\n\r\nI am at new edition of the “Structural Botany,” as a bit of ad interim\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 9, 1878.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COLLEAGUE: ... A copy of the second part of the “Synoptical\r\nFlora of North America” should soon reach you, for I was assured at\r\nWashington that they were sent at once, and would go to you without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nIf the “Revue Scientifique de Genève” takes book notices, I shall be\r\npleased if you will notice this publication of mine. I send it to you,\r\nand to Boissier; also to Maximowicz of St. Petersburg, but to no one\r\nelse on the Continent. It is put on sale with Trübner & Company, London,\r\nand T. O. Weigel, Leipsic. I have defrayed the whole cost out of my own\r\npurse, to the tune of $2,050. No publisher would take it, and assume\r\nthe expense, so I have to carry it myself and botanists must buy it, if\r\nthey want it. I hope many botanists and libraries will do so; for I must\r\nget the outlay back again, or a good part of it, before I go on. Hence,\r\nnotices in the scientific journals and elsewhere may be serviceable to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI will not speak of or count the time and hard labor I have bestowed on\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nMy last visit to Washington was a sad one, to attend the funeral of my\r\ndear old friend Professor Joseph Henry, to whom we are all greatly\r\nindebted. When I saw him in January, at the annual meeting of the\r\nregents of the Smithsonian Institution, it was too evident that he would\r\nnot much longer be with us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs may be remembered, Dr. Gray, when in Paris in 1839, found in\r\nMichaux’s herbarium a plant which he describes as new, giving it the\r\nname of Shortia galacifolia, in honor of his old friend Dr. Short of\r\nLouisville, Ky. One great object of his later journeys to the southern\r\nAlleghanies was the search for this plant. No botanist had succeeded in\r\nrediscovering it, and many doubted if Dr. Gray had not been mistaken,\r\nthough he found among Japanese plants, sent from St. Petersburg, one of\r\nthe same genus, with a rude Japanese woodcut. It was therefore a great\r\ntriumph when it was accidentally discovered by an herb-collector, Mr.\r\nHyams, in North Carolina. The next journey to the mountains, in 1879,\r\nwas planned to search for it especially.\r\n\r\nAn account of the rediscovery and a description of the plant is given in\r\n“American Journal of Science,” iii., xvi., pp. 483, 1878. Mr. Sargent\r\nrepeats the story in “Garden and Forest,” December 19, 1888, and tells\r\nhow in 1886 he followed Michaux’s steps up the Keowee River, in the\r\nmountains of South Carolina, farther south than the search had been\r\nbefore, and was rewarded by finding the plant in abundance. Professor W.\r\nW. Bailey, of Providence, then sent a note to “Garden and Forest,” to\r\nsay that to Mr. J. W. Congdon, then of Providence, belongs the credit of\r\nhaving sent the first news of the discovery of the plant to Dr. Gray,\r\nand tells of Dr. Gray’s answer: “If you think you have Shortia send it\r\non.” It was sent. Then came from Dr. Gray the characteristic postal, “It\r\nis so. Now let me sing my nunc dimittis!”\r\n\r\nTO W. M. CANBY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 21, 1878.\r\n\r\nDEAR CANBY,--Thanks; glad you can come. You will be notified, if the\r\ncase comes on.\r\n\r\nIf you will come here I can show what will delight your eyes, and cure\r\nyou effectually of that skeptical spirit you used to have about Shortia\r\ngalacifolia. It is before me, with corolla and all, from North Carolina!\r\n\r\nThink of that! My long faith rewarded at last!\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nP. S.--No other botanist has the news.\r\n\r\nOctober 28, 1878.\r\n\r\n... I wrote to Hyams how much immortality he lost, or rather postponed,\r\nfor his son, by not sending me that specimen eighteen months ago, so\r\nthat it would go into “Flora,” but that I should make his name famous in\r\n“Silliman’s Journal,” pro tem.\r\n\r\nI took the latter end of his letter to be a cancel of his request to\r\nreturn the specimen. Told him that in May either you or I or both would\r\nbe down, call for his boy, and be taken to the spot!\r\n\r\nI have no objection to give him money for this specimen, if he wants it.\r\nBut I would not advise that he advertise it. But if he can find plenty\r\nof roots, he might legitimately put them on sale, and get a good price.\r\nWhy should he not?\r\n\r\nI did not say, before, that this discovery has given me a hundred times\r\nthe satisfaction that the election into the Institute did. That caused\r\nno particular elation. This has been a great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nNovember 5, 1878.\r\n\r\n... I send a brief notice to “Silliman’s Journal.” And I am finishing an\r\naccount of the matter, which I will send to Paris, to Decaisne, for the\r\n“Académie des Sciences,” as a “Correspondent” ought.\r\n\r\nI have declined to risk the specimen by mail, till we get more, which is\r\nnot so certain.\r\n\r\nNovember 9, 1878.\r\n\r\n... He (Hyams) sent me some loose flowers, to help out.\r\n\r\nI have sent manuscript to Paris, and shall send back Decaisne’s old\r\ndrawing, and drawing of flower and details, now making by Sprague to be\r\nreproduced in the “Annales des Sciences Naturelles,” since this ought to\r\nplease the French.\r\n\r\nYou can go to see and get specimens, even if I do not. Yet I will go\r\nif--at the time--I can.\r\n\r\nApril 5, 1879.\r\n\r\nOn April 1 (ominous day) began Compositæ....\r\n\r\nTO G. FREDERICK WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nApril 1, 1878.\r\n\r\n... I like an article to begin or end with an aphorism, or some sort of\r\nsnapper. I think you may end your next article with a condensed\r\nexpression like this: Not vitality but personality is the witness for\r\nimmortality!\r\n\r\nOctober 24, 1878.\r\n\r\n... Yes, I read with interest and approval your article on Hypothesis.\r\n\r\nI am pressed with work now all this week. I would send you the proofs of\r\nNewcomb’s article,[106] but you will get it in the “Independent” almost\r\nas soon.\r\n\r\nRead, mark, and tell me what I should say. I must now lay myself out on\r\nthis matter. If you will allow, I want to drop, throw out, praying for\r\nthe weather quoad weather.\r\n\r\nI shall take my time, but shall be turning the matter in my mind, at the\r\nend of this week and beginning of the next.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may see you on Monday here, unless I am called away.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 24, 1879.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--I have just returned from Washington, where I had\r\nto read a memorial of our late secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,\r\nProfessor Henry,[107] and I have returned somewhat crippled by lumbago.\r\nI took with me your pleasant letter of the 29th December, intending to\r\nwrite to you from there, but I found no time. The present moment is\r\nopportune, as I cannot well move about as I must do in my ordinary\r\nwork....\r\n\r\nI have sent for Saporta’s book, and shall study it with interest. Glad I\r\nam that your “Phytographie” is in hand. I wish I had it now before me;\r\nfor I have now to write something on the subject for a new edition of my\r\n“Botanical Text-Book,” now in hand.\r\n\r\nHow well Bentham still writes and works! Notice his essay on\r\nEuphorbiaceæ. You and Bentham have kept orthodox views of nomenclature\r\nat the fore in Europe, and I have seconded them here, so that, except\r\namong cryptogamists, heterodoxy makes no headway.\r\n\r\nI have some ideas about the best form for Latin specific characters, as\r\ndistinguished from descriptions, as to punctuation, etc., which I wish\r\nto present to you. Perhaps I can best, and soon, do so by sending you\r\nproof-sheets.\r\n\r\nThe link which connected us with a former generation of botanists is\r\nbroken. Jacob Bigelow, the correspondent of Muhlenberg[108] and of J. E.\r\nSmith, as well as your father, died on the 10th inst., at the age of\r\nninety-two. Up to three or four years ago he preserved all his\r\nfaculties. But sight and hearing gradually failed, and for two years he\r\nhas been merely alive; at length the candle burned out.\r\n\r\nThe genus Bigelovia, which your father founded on one species, is now\r\none of the most characteristic North American genera, of many species,\r\nchiefly west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robbins,[109] also of Massachusetts, one of the best and oldest\r\nlocal botanists, died the day before, aged seventy-seven.\r\n\r\nEngelmann (two or three years older than I am) and myself are now the\r\noldest botanists of the country, I believe.\r\n\r\nWhile I live I am always your devoted,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, May 22, 1879.\r\n\r\n... We go on a trip south to the mountains of Carolina with Canby,\r\nRedfield, and this time Sargent.\r\n\r\nIt was to have been done whenever Shortia blossomed. But that stole a\r\nmarch on us by flowering in April. So now we time it for the\r\nRhododendrons, and will see Shortia out of blossom, and we hope to find\r\nnew stations. Then I want to look up Darbya, of which only the male is\r\nknown. Curtis seems to have got it, without flowers, near Lincolnton.\r\nThen we are to explore the east side of the Blue Ridge, from the base of\r\nBlack Mountain to Grandfather, and then cross to the Roan, on which is\r\nnow the Cloudland Hotel.\r\n\r\nOh dear! now that the time draws near, I wish I could stay at home and\r\nfinish Parry and Palmer’s[110] Mexican Compositæ, which abound with new\r\nor interesting species!...\r\n\r\nI send you by mail a copy of my new “Text-Book.” You see I relegate to\r\nother hands the anatomy, physiology, and cryptogamia,--glad to be rid of\r\nthem. I send, too, one of the few copies of the Shortia paper. The\r\ntranslator into French in several places missed my meaning. And the\r\nexplanation of the plate is a botch. I numbered only the floral parts I\r\nnow furnished, expecting the materials from Herbier Paris to make\r\nanother plate. Decaisne crowded all on one plate, and numbered to suit\r\nhimself, and then printed my explanation unaltered. The numbers do not\r\nmatch at all....\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM M. CANBY.\r\n\r\nApril 25, 1879.\r\n\r\n... About scheme: it is rather my notion to go via Statesville to\r\nNewton, explore down one fork of Catawba, till we find Darbya, or find\r\nCurtis’s locality, and back by the other; two days. But perhaps, to save\r\ntime, you would prefer to keep on the railroad from Statesville to\r\nLincolnton (where, by the way, Magnolia macrophylla grows), pick up\r\nDarbya, and then come up to us at Statesville or Marion. Then we will\r\nsee locality of Shortia.\r\n\r\nThen, my notion is to get some good searches along the flanks of the\r\nmountains, from Swananoa Gap to Linville Falls (find Shortia for\r\nourselves, etc.), and even up to Deep Gap, which you see is pretty well\r\nnorth. Then make Cowles tote us to Bakersville, and then end on Roan\r\nMountain.\r\n\r\nThere I and my wife would like to stay several days; and you, if it must\r\nbe, could leave us and get home.\r\n\r\nBut I am not particular, if you prefer a southern trip; down to Jackson\r\nCounty, etc., and get Vasey’s new Rhododendron,--only a day south of\r\nwhere we went before.\r\n\r\nSargent, our director, wants to go, and go in September, so that he can\r\nget live things. Perhaps he will join us.\r\n\r\nMy wife’s desiderata are simply these: To see both Rhododendrons in\r\nflower, and to get some rough wagon-rides. It seems not difficult to\r\nsatisfy her simple desires. Moreover, what do you say to our brothers\r\nand our nieces, with their aunt? The nieces are trumps of girls for\r\ntraveling companions, and their father worthy of them. They are enticed\r\nby our accounts of Rhododendrons and the nice rough times, and the\r\nchance of sleeping in their spectacles, and Roan Mountain, where they\r\nwould like to stay a week! Perhaps even, we would show them New River\r\nSprings with their rocks, etc., on the way homeward.\r\n\r\nIf they join us, it will probably be after we have done the Shortia and\r\nDarbya business.\r\n\r\nIs there yet any chance of Redfield? Now you look up routes, etc., and\r\ngive me your ideas. I wish we had your “heavenly weather.”\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 7, 1879.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CANBY,--Verses seem to be the order of the day. So here goes:--\r\n\r\n     With Misses L. the saying runs,\r\n    “However good a man be,\r\n     The most that can be said of him\r\n     Is, He ’s as nice as Can-be.”\r\n\r\n... You will want to know how Mrs. Gray and I got on. Finely, with two\r\nhard days at the close....\r\n\r\nFirst day, we got round, retracing our old route, to Blaylocks, a hard\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n2d. Traveled all day up the north fork of Toe, through scenery which\r\ndelighted Mrs. Gray greatly, to head of a fork thereof in Yellow\r\nMountains, and thence over to Cranberry Fork, almost under the shadow of\r\nthe Roan, or of that prolongation of it which we went to; nice food and\r\nlodgings and the luxury of a separate room.\r\n\r\n3d. Down Cranberry Creek and up Elk, over Elk Mountain (got Cedronella\r\ncordata. Want any?), from which climbed to a good view, down to Valle\r\nCrucis, and over to Boone, to sleep; a long day.\r\n\r\n4th. Drove fourteen miles, partly on Blue Ridge, to Gap Creek, at noon.\r\nNice house. Very nice wife and children.\r\n\r\n5th. Mrs. Gray rested. Cowles and I went up Blue Ridge, saw a fine\r\nwaterfall on the eastern side.\r\n\r\n6th. Took in Mrs. Cowles, baby, and bright little girl. Drove fourteen\r\nmiles to Jefferson, picnic dinner on the way; stopped with an uncle and\r\naunt of Mrs. C. I and some Jeffersonians went up Negro Mountain;\r\ncollected Saxifraga Careyana at the original locality; took a view of\r\nwhere Aconitum reclinatum must be, went for it, found it, some specimens\r\nbarely in bud, more in flower,[111] made specimens for you and for\r\nRedfield, took roots.\r\n\r\n7th. Cowles and family to wait and visit, while we took their wagon to\r\nMarion, forty-five miles, too much for a day. (Good souls the Cowles!)\r\nBut when we had got on six miles, met a wagon from Marion, the men in\r\nwhich proposed an exchange, which we (for the Cowles’s sake) gladly\r\nconsented to. Were to cross the Iron Mountain that day, if time held out\r\n(which it did), and stop at a McCarthy’s at the foot, twelve miles from\r\nMarion. Reaching the place just at dusk, the driver insisted that this\r\nnice house was not the place, but a mile or two farther on. So we tired\r\npeople drove on by moonlight, three miles further, to find he was\r\nmistaken, and no lodgings to be had, except possibly a mile further.\r\nCame to a house, routed a man and wife out of bed, found a great fire\r\nstill on the hearth, no decent chance to sleep. Concluded the only way\r\nthen was to push on the eight miles more, so as to get the train the\r\nnext morning at 6.35. Got with difficulty a little corn for the horses,\r\nbrought out Mrs. Gray’s tea-kettle, made tea, ate the remains of our\r\ndinner, and thus refreshed, jogged on; reached Marion at one A.M., slept\r\ntill half past five, rose, took train at 6.50. And Mrs. Gray still\r\nlives! Were waiting hungrily for our breakfast at Wyethville, when,\r\nthree miles from it, a slight double thud, a down-brake signal, the last\r\nbreath of the engine, a stop. To our vast surprise, on looking out,\r\nengine, and three cars, and first section of high bridge were missing,\r\nand were débris in the abyss. No such accident could have been managed\r\nwith less shock to the nerves. And as to the result, had it been after\r\nbreakfast and passengers smoking in the second-class car, there would\r\nhave been a greater fatality (glad to say, I don’t smoke)....\r\n\r\nThere were weak ladies and hungry and sick children on board. I\r\nclambered down the embankment with that blessed tea-kettle, to a poor\r\nhouse, got a fire made, and hot water. Another traveler going farther\r\ngot a pot of coffee, nice bread and butter and cold boiled ham. And so\r\nwe fared till omnibuses came for us. At Wyethville a good hotel; got\r\nword at length to Shriver;[112] and after a late dinner, an extra train\r\ncame down, took us to Lynchburg; reached Washington before 8 A.M.\r\n\r\nI will send you good specimen of original Saxifraga Careyana, from Negro\r\nMountain. Send me a good large one from Roan. I will compare them soon.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 4, 1879.\r\n\r\nYour last letter has gone to Engelmann, as I notified you; those of May\r\n29 and June 4 overtook me in the mountains of North Carolina, where Mrs.\r\nGray and I were recuperating, but I was kept on the move from morn to\r\nnight. I could not thence write you on the matters treated of, nor is\r\nthere anything left to say....\r\n\r\nNature sometimes does what you hit me for suggesting, that is, “take\r\naway the essential character,” and we have to put up with it, and allow\r\nthat we may have overrated the character.\r\n\r\nBut, when all is done, I will try on your view without prejudice, and\r\nadopt it if possible.\r\n\r\nAbout Ceratophyllum: I never followed up that early paper, of 1837,\r\nbecause I soon saw that I was very wrong in supposing that the ovules of\r\nCabomba and Nelumbium were like that of Ceratophyllum, and I concluded\r\nthat my whole idea was baseless. I have not looked at the matter since,\r\nbut I shall be much surprised if you find that my youthful idea is\r\nworthy of resuscitation.\r\n\r\nWe have come back from the cool mountains of the South to really hot\r\nweather at the North.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 15, 1879.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--Your pleasant letter of the 3d June reached me on\r\nRoan Mountain, in a comfortable little house, at the elevation of about\r\n6,200 feet above the sea, enjoying glorious views of range after range\r\nof the Alleghany Mountains, and on the grassy plateau Rhododendron\r\nCatawbiense, perhaps more of it than in all the rest of the world, just\r\ncoming into blossom. Then the valleys and mountainsides all around,\r\ncovered with rich forest, are adorned with Rhododendron maximum, and\r\nKalmia latifolia in immense abundance and profuse blossoming, of every\r\nhue from deep rose to white, and here and there, among other flowering\r\nshrubs, Azalea calendulacea, of every hue from light yellow to the\r\ndeepest flame color. Mrs. Gray was with me, with her brother, two\r\nnieces, and a botanical party consisting of Messrs. Canby, Redfield, and\r\nSargent. We traversed a pretty large and very wild region, much of which\r\nI had before visited, some thirty-eight years before. We went to the\r\nlocality of Shortia galacifolia, discovered by Hyams; but our search for\r\nnew stations, or for the old one of Michaux, was in vain. But I have now\r\na clear idea of the district in which it may be sought. The known\r\nstation is probably one to which the plant has been brought down.\r\n\r\nI have returned home to a crowd of work....\r\n\r\nI wait with great interest your volume on Phytography. You will see that\r\nin my new “Text-Book” we are quite in accord. I agree with you about new\r\nand useless terms, and the execrable taste of the Germans.\r\n\r\nI am very strong, and can climb a mountain as well as ever, only I lose\r\nbreath except I move slowly in the ascent.\r\n\r\nMemory rather fails; otherwise I have at near sixty-nine all my\r\nfaculties in fair condition.\r\n\r\nIt has happened that I have visited Europe every eleven years. According\r\nto that you should see me next year! I cannot promise; but I am always\r\naffectionately yours,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nNovember 11, 1879.\r\n\r\nI forgot to ask if you, or your friend Lord Blachford, knew Arthur James\r\nBalfour, M. P., author of “A Defense of Philosophic Doubt,” published\r\nrecently by Macmillan?\r\n\r\nIt is the most masterly essay I have seen of late years, and I should\r\nlike to know who the man is, and what you think of his book.\r\n\r\nI have been drawn into promising, in an unguarded moment, to give two\r\nlectures to the theological class of Yale College (our oldest university\r\nafter Harvard) some time in the course of the winter, on Science and\r\nReligion; a topic which calls for wise speaking. I am not very hopeful,\r\nbut still I have an idea I may do some good. I wish you were in reach,\r\nthat we might talk over the subject....\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 1, 1880.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--Though I have entered on the seventieth year of my\r\nage, I hold out well, and when other cares do not interrupt, I go on\r\nwith the “Compositæ,” yet all too slowly. Before I print them I shall\r\nhope to have another inspection of some of the species of the\r\n“Prodromus” in your herbarium; perhaps before this year 1880 is out, yet\r\nit is rather doubtful. I get on slowly, and then Mr. Watson, who will\r\nhave the “Flora of California” off his hands as soon as he can get the\r\nmanuscript of the “Gramineæ” out of Professor Thurber’s hands, must have\r\na vacation ramble, probably to Oregon. If he leaves here in the spring,\r\nI must wait his return here in the autumn, or at most cannot leave home\r\nuntil after midsummer; too late to render myself at Geneva, I suppose.\r\n\r\nMuch of my time of the last few months has been occupied with the\r\ndetails of building a small addition to our herbarium building to\r\ncontain the botanical library. It is just finished, and the books will\r\nnow be moved into it in a few days....\r\n\r\nMy health is excellent. Let us hope the same for you, and offer my best\r\nwishes for the year 1880.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray delivered in the winter of 1880 two lectures to the theological\r\nschool of Yale College, on Natural Science and Religion.\r\n\r\nThey were long and carefully thought out, and he had great pleasure in\r\nspeaking to an audience who followed him so closely, and evidently with\r\nsuch attentive sympathy.\r\n\r\nHe also enjoyed very much reading them, before delivery, to his friend\r\nDr. O. W. Holmes, in Boston.\r\n\r\nTO G. FREDERICK WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 17, 1880.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND,--We go Monday night on to Washington, leaving here at five\r\nP.M. My lectures are fixed for February 5 and 6, so that I shall return\r\nfrom Washington and go on specially to New Haven.\r\n\r\nI expect to be at home the last week of the month, but perhaps not on\r\nMonday, and I should wish to see you and read my second lecture, which\r\nis dragging its slow length along!...\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 11, 1880.\r\n\r\nI have this moment received and read from Newman Smyth a flattering\r\nnote, and a copy of his article in the “Advance.” A very good one it is,\r\nand his own thoughts are noteworthy and to the point.\r\n\r\nPresident Gilman of the Johns Hopkins sent me a very admiring letter, in\r\nwhich he urges a student’s edition, on thinner paper and paper covers,\r\nwhich he wants to subscribe for. I shall send it to the publisher before\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nApril 11, 1880.\r\n\r\nI am amused at Professor ----’s substitution of demiurgism for\r\nevolution, reprinted in the “Independent,” and at the coolness with\r\nwhich the professor proclaims that a hypothesis which he thinks is good\r\nfor nothing else may be good to put against evolutionism.\r\n\r\nDarwin has sent me advance sheets of his book on Advantage of Crosses\r\n(not moral but floral crosses, and not crosses made of flowers, but\r\nthose made by insects and winds for the benefit of flowers), and I see\r\nmuch in it which you will enjoy. I am too full of work to use it next\r\nweek, and if you tell me you will come Monday and take it, I will lend\r\nit to you for that week.\r\n\r\nProfessor Fisher has sent me an admirable sermon on “The Folly of\r\nAtheism.” Have you seen it?\r\n\r\n... I would change a word in paragraph seven. If by proof you mean\r\ndemonstration of its truth, I remark that rational explanation of the\r\nphenomena, so far as known, does not prove an hypothesis. Two different\r\nhypotheses may do that; and it may long be impossible to get a crucial\r\ntest.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray was at work on another part of the “Synoptical Flora.” Asters\r\nhad always been his especial study, and a great and puzzling labor, and\r\nthese few lines tell of his difficulties.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nApril 17, 1880.\r\n\r\nWe heard only incidentally of your accident, and were very sorry. Do be\r\ncareful. Don’t climb ladders. Leave that to young fellows like me!...\r\n\r\nI am half dead with Aster. I got on very fairly till I got into the\r\nthick of the genus, among what I called Dumosi and Salicifolia. Here I\r\nwork and work, but make no headway at all. I can’t tell what are species\r\nand how to define any of them, nor what the nomenclature is, i. e., what\r\nare original names.\r\n\r\nI will take this group abroad, but it will be just as bad there, unless\r\nI can get some settled ideas before I start. I never was so boggled.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow I’ll sit down and study your Pinus paper, which I have not\r\nlooked at yet, so absorbed have I been....\r\n\r\nMy old friend John Carey has died, in England, at eighty-three.\r\nSchimper, they say, is dead. They go one by one!\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, May 8.\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks for your very lively letter of May 4,--auspicious day,\r\nbeing my wedding-day, thirty-second anniversary....\r\n\r\nYes, we mean to go abroad right after the meeting of American\r\nAssociation, say September 4, to finish Aster, etc.; to stay at least a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nMy wife sends best love to you, your daughter, and son, and I join.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. REDFIELD.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 21, 1880.\r\n\r\nDEAR REDFIELD,--If you hear of my breaking down utterly, and being sent\r\nto an asylum, you may lay it to Aster, which is a slow and fatal poison.\r\n\r\nApparently it will take a year or more for me to finish it, with the\r\ngreater chance that it finishes me before that time....\r\n\r\nApril 24.\r\n\r\nThanks for both specimen and sympathy. The former is here safely\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nThe A. glacialis I must seek in Nuttall’s herbarium, now at the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nThe principal troubles in Aster are packed away, to try on again, in\r\nLondon, Paris, and Berlin.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, May 17, 1880.\r\n\r\nMY HONORED AND DEAR FRIEND,--Is it possible (I fear it is) that your\r\nletter to me at the beginning of the winter (telling me who Balfour, M.\r\nP., is) has been all this while unacknowledged? I fear it is even so.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time much has happened, at least in your old world, on which\r\ninterest centres; here not much, but constant and rather humdrum work\r\nfor me. We have got through the winter, a mild one, in contrast to\r\nyours, so severe and trying, and our spring opens pleasantly; and Mrs.\r\nGray and I are well and happy.\r\n\r\nYou have had a parliamentary election, the result of which we delight\r\nin, though it took us, and seemingly most of you, by surprise. I fancy\r\nyou are pleased to see Gladstone again at the helm, and still more at\r\nthe collapse of Jingoism,--not a moment too soon.\r\n\r\nBut let me hasten to tell you that Mrs. Gray and I contemplate crossing\r\nthe Atlantic early in September, and of passing at least a full year in\r\nEngland and on the Continent. A busy year it must be, if my powers hold\r\nout; for I must do a deal of work, and I want to have a little play. I\r\nwish I could be more ready, by the finishing of my general study of the\r\nvast order Compositæ, so that I might know exactly what researches I\r\nmust make in London, Paris, Berlin, etc. I have not got on as I\r\nexpected; but, as I am to reach seventy if I live to near the end of the\r\ncurrent year, I must no longer postpone my voyage. Indeed, I would leave\r\nat midsummer if I could get away. But the American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science meets in Boston at the end of August, and has a\r\nday in Cambridge. And it would not do for me, an ex-president, to turn\r\nmy back on it, and upon a houseful of friends whom we wish to entertain.\r\nBut the moment it is over we shall hope to be off.\r\n\r\nI think I must work at Aster, etc., at Kew for a few weeks; and I have a\r\nfancy for a run through the west and south of France and, perhaps,\r\nSpain!\r\n\r\nYou will be returning from some summer trip about the time we reach\r\nEngland. Cannot you and Mrs. Church get away from a dark and dull London\r\nNovember, and go with us to a summer region!\r\n\r\nI sent you my Yale Lectures, which had to treat difficult and delicate\r\nmatters. I find they have been useful to some on either side.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 8, 1880.\r\n\r\nI have left your kind letter of March 11 too long unacknowledged. Now I\r\nhave to thank you for a copy of the “Phytographie,” which interests me\r\nexceedingly. I have also to say that my plans for the year are so far\r\nsettled that I have engaged passage for Mrs. Gray and myself in a Cunard\r\nsteamer from Boston for Liverpool on the 4th of September, the earliest\r\ndate on which we could leave home.\r\n\r\nBut, greatly as you tempt me, and much as I should like to see you\r\nearly, we cannot reach Switzerland this autumn....\r\n\r\nI should hope we might see you in early summer. So, pray, keep yourself\r\nwell and strong till then.\r\n\r\nAbout the “Phytographie:” I shall have much to write, when I read the\r\nbook, which as yet I have only glanced at. About dextrorsum and\r\nsinistrorsum: I think it is not quite true that the innovators have not\r\ngiven any account of the grounds on which they rest. Mine are expressed,\r\nI believe, in two or three notes in “American Journal of Science,” and\r\nare summed up in my “Botanical Text-Book,” last edition, p. 516,\r\nreferred to in the glossary and index. I think that the analogy of the\r\nright-handed screw indicates how the world in general regard it, ab\r\nextra. There is a sensible note on the question in the late\r\nClerk-Maxwell’s “Treatise on Electricity,” vol. 1,--the reference is not\r\nat hand at this moment. It takes, essentially, our (my) view as it seems\r\nto me; but it refers to a similar confusion between the mathematicians\r\nand the physicists.\r\n\r\nI wish you had gone on to illustrate more of the words which have been\r\nchanged or confused in meaning; for example, “pistillum,” “cyme,” etc.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that the terms of nomenclature had not been rearranged by\r\nRoeper[113] so as to conflict less with those of Linnæus and the general\r\nbotanical use.\r\n\r\nWe have had our centennial of the American Academy; a pleasant\r\nreunion....\r\n\r\nMr. Winthrop gave a good public address.\r\n\r\nI get only slowly on with the Compositæ; my interruptions and\r\ndistractions are many and great. Fortunately I am in perfect health; am\r\noutliving my chronic catarrh. I hope you may do so also!\r\n\r\nJune 28, 1880.\r\n\r\nYours of the 15th is duly received, with your pleasant remarks on my\r\nlectures.[114] Professor Bourier is very welcome, and will please me by\r\nusing any part of them he chooses. I should like to see how they would\r\nread in French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFINAL JOURNEYS AND WORK.\r\n\r\n1880-1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Gray sailed for Europe with Mrs. Gray early in September, 1880. He\r\nwent especially to study herbaria for his new volume of the “Synoptical\r\nFlora,” and saw almost every collection of importance, giving especial\r\nattention to the subject of asters. The autumn was spent in western\r\nFrance and Spain, and in Madrid he looked over the herbarium there. He\r\ndeclared nobody had ever had so many asters pass through his hands as he\r\nhad had!\r\n\r\nThe winter was spent in hard work in the Kew herbarium. He enjoyed\r\nheartily in spring a journey through Italy with his friends Sir Joseph\r\nand Lady Hooker, returning to Kew to spend the summer, at work in the\r\nherbarium, and he sailed again for home in October, 1881, landing early\r\nin November.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. REDFIELD.\r\n\r\nHÔTEL CONTINENTAL, PARIS, October 3, 1880.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR REDFIELD,--Many thanks for letter of 17th September, which\r\nreached me at Kew, where we passed a busy and happy fortnight with the\r\nHookers, and did some botanical work. We left Friday morning, reached\r\nParis pleasantly that evening, where we make only two days more stay at\r\npresent, but leave Tuesday for the Loire district and thence to Spain,\r\nbut expect to return here after our round, and stay possibly a month.\r\nPlay first, work afterwards, is our present motto. If the Academy, or\r\nany of the brethren, take Garber’s little Porto Rico collection, you or\r\nthey will be glad to know that Professor Oliver and I named them up\r\nwhile I was at Kew, and that the list has been forwarded to D. C. Eaton.\r\nNews I have little to tell you. Yet, though we left home only a month\r\nago, it seems a half year. We had a botanical concours at Kew; for De\r\nCandolle and wife came over, as he says, to see Mrs. Gray and me, and\r\nthe Hookers gave two dinner parties on the occasion; present four\r\nbotanists, whose united ages sum up high, for Bentham had his eightieth\r\nbirthday just before, De Candolle is about seventy-five, I on the verge\r\nof seventy, and Hooker, the baby of the set, in his sixty-fourth year;\r\nsome younger botanists were with us,--Oliver, Baker, Masters, young\r\nBalfour, etc.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nMALAGA, August 30, 1880.\r\n\r\n... As to pictures, you know I am no picture sharp; but Madrid and\r\nSeville (which must be taken together) are a revelation of Murillo and\r\nVelasquez.... That kind of thing is nearly over with us on leaving\r\nattractive and sunny Seville. We cut off Jerez and Cordova, and came in\r\nhere yesterday through olive groves enough to saponify and saladulate\r\ncreation, and the passage through the mountains from Bobadilla to\r\nMalaga, wonderfully grand, ending in orange groves filling lovely dells\r\nand valleys. Nothing to keep us long here, though picturesqueness is\r\nnot wanting. The days are hot. At Granada, to which we fly to-morrow\r\nafternoon, we expect to find the _juste milieu_....\r\n\r\nOne bit of this sheet to tell you that Joey’s portrait has been painted\r\nby Murillo, and a good likeness, hair, pose, and features. He is holding\r\na bird aloft, and a white little dog is looking up wistfully at it, to\r\nJoey’s delight. It is in the Museum at Madrid, and is much admired....\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nTHE ALHAMBRA, GRANADA, November 2, 1880.\r\n\r\nIt is time that you should be thanked for the notes you kindly sent us.\r\nThey will come of use later. You will wish to know what we have been\r\ndoing for the past month, only a month by the almanac, for we left\r\nEngland October 1, and Paris on the 6th, the latter being the date we\r\ncount from. So that there is not yet quite a month of travel, yet it\r\nseems a long while, as if stored with a year’s memories. And the weather\r\nthroughout has been superb. One cold day in Paris, and some cool nights\r\nbetween Bordeaux and Madrid; and then, even at Madrid, we had summer\r\nrather than autumn weather, until, ascending from Malaga to this higher\r\nregion, the cool and fresh air which comes down from the snow-flecked\r\nSierra Nevada makes the sunshine pleasant and wraps desirable at\r\nnightfall.\r\n\r\nA few midday hours served for Orleans, and we went on to Blois. You know\r\nhow very charming that is, and you may imagine Mrs. Gray’s delight at\r\nthe castle, also at Chambord, to which we drove. Two nights there and\r\nthree at Tours. The cathedral charmed us; also the old houses and ruined\r\nbits and towers. We passed Amboise, and went from Tours to Chenonceaux\r\nand back by railway,--a bijou to be enjoyed; but the next day’s\r\nexcursion to Lôches had a much deeper and more varied interest. By\r\ntraveling over night to Bayonne and passing Biarritz at sunrise, a noble\r\nsunrise and morning, with the Atlantic on one side and the Cantabrian\r\nPyrenees on the other, we gained the privilege of a daylight journey\r\nfrom Irun to Burgos. It is far more picturesque and striking than I had\r\nsupposed. A day at Burgos was a treat, as you may suppose. Leon lay out\r\nof our track and demanded night hours and night changes too severe and\r\ntoo formidable for a couple ignorant of Spanish and impatient of\r\ncouriers. So we went on overnight to Madrid (night travel being\r\ninevitable); and here we had a warm, sunny, busy, and most enjoyable\r\nweek, some pleasant home-friends for companions, as also a charming\r\nSpanish family, M. and Mme. Riaño, whom we had met at our minister’s,\r\nLowell, at London. She is a daughter of Gayangos and had an English\r\nmother; is a charming mixture of Spanish and English and everything that\r\nis bright and good. Then there was a raree-show not to be matched out of\r\nSpain: the royal family with the infanta going to church in state, the\r\ngrand procession kindly going and returning under our windows. The\r\nArmeria and, still more, the Archeological Museum were full of the Old\r\nWorld things we Americans dote on. And then the great picture-gallery,\r\nsupplemented not a little by the Academia San Fernando. Add to these\r\nthe pictures at Seville, and imagine the treat we have had. I shall\r\nleave all this for Mrs. Gray to expatiate upon next winter.\r\n\r\nWe now know Murillo, and rank him next to Titian, and in feeling and\r\ndelicacy much above him. He could paint something besides Spanish-girl\r\nMadonnas, lovely as they are, and Spanish beggars, where he had only to\r\ncopy from the streets; and whoever has not seen St. Elisabeth of\r\nHungary, the Roman Senator and his Wife, the Guardian Angel, Moses\r\nstriking the Rock, and its companion, the Loaves and Fishes, and the St.\r\nAntony of Padua, down to whom the Infant Christ lightly floats,\r\nencircled with child angels, has not yet seen the works of Murillo. Then\r\nVelasquez, most noble, and Zurbaran and Ribera, and Cano, Morales, and\r\nMoro, and others whom I never knew aught about before. At Toledo we\r\npassed two days and three nights, well filled with sights of Old World\r\nthings hardly touched by the later ages; and there is the grandest of\r\ncathedrals; and yet the interior of that of Seville is rather more\r\nsatisfying. These three, Burgos, Toledo, Seville, I should place in this\r\nascending order, or bracketing the latter two.\r\n\r\nA journey overnight brought us at sunrise into Andalusia, at Cordova,\r\nwhich we passed (to take on the way from Granada), and so to Seville for\r\nbreakfast, three happy, sunny, busy days there, and then to Malaga, two\r\ndays, and then on to this place, which we reached after dark, and are\r\nnow enjoying our second day in.\r\n\r\nThere are two hotels up here, under the Alhambra walls, and we are at\r\none of them. Yesterday the road which rises to the crown of the hill\r\nwas crowded with people of the town below, going up to the cemetery with\r\nflowers and lamps and candles and drapery, to ornament the tombs and\r\ngraves of relatives, which here is done on All Saints’ Day, and we saw\r\nthe curious sight by day and walked up again in the evening, when all\r\nwas alight, and in a chapel a sort of requiem service performing. We\r\nwill not describe the Alhambra. I fancied I should think the work\r\nfinical; but you are carried away by it. But of most interest was our\r\nvisit to the Cathedral of Granada this morning and to the Capilla Real,\r\nto see all the relics and contemporary memorials of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, their effigies, sword, sceptre, etc., their noble tombs, more\r\nrich and beautiful, I think, than those of the Constable and his wife at\r\nBurgos, and then to descend into the vault and see their rude iron\r\ncoffins, which have not been desecrated nor molested, and also those of\r\nPhilip I. and his poor wife Joanna. (Let us tell you, some day, of a\r\nmodern Spanish picture, at Madrid, of her and her husband’s coffin,\r\nwhich she wearily had carried with her.) All this, and what we see here\r\non the spot of the Moorish life, and what we saw at the cathedral, gives\r\na vivid reality that nothing else can.\r\n\r\nAnd here my sheet is full and my gossip must be cut short, with short\r\nspace to add the kindest remembrances and love which my wife joins in\r\nsending to you and yours and daughters.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nHÔTEL ST. ROMAIN, PARIS, November 14, 1880.\r\n\r\nHere we are back at Paris (since twenty hours), and, this being Sunday,\r\nhaving discharged my religious duty and ventilated my patriotism by\r\ngoing in the morning to the American Chapel I am going to discharge upon\r\nyou a missive which may be of some size,--is sure to be so if I open all\r\nmy mind. Whence did I write you last? Malaga, I fancy, where I received\r\na letter from you ... which tells us of the conflagration of Charlie’s\r\ndog and cat, and the narrow escape of the owner, of horrid weather,\r\nwhile we have had only one rainy day, and that no great impediment\r\n(though I did have to examine the Botanic Garden at Valencia under an\r\numbrella and in india-rubbers)....\r\n\r\nA good day was occupied in going to Cordova, and the next morning did\r\nthe Mosque-Cathedral, which I expected to be disappointing, yet it was\r\nnot. Afternoon began the long journey which there was no escaping,\r\nnortheast to Valencia: a dull place made duller by rain. Next afternoon\r\nto Tarragona, and a most charming day in that interesting old town and\r\nits environs, the evening taking us on to Barcelona, of less interest.\r\nThe next day’s travel, long and delightful, was all by daylight, except\r\nthe last hour. It took us along either beautiful or picturesque country,\r\nmuch of the way with the Mediterranean on one side and the Pyrenees on\r\nthe other, out of Spain and as far as Narbonne. A day’s excursion was\r\ngiven to Carcassonne; perfect, and stranded on the shore of time, an\r\nexcellent example of a Middle Age fortified city, cathedral and all;\r\nVisigoth walls and towers on Roman foundations, extended and modernized\r\nby the father of St. Louis, and the finishing touches by St. Louis\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHere endeth the epistle. The rest is simply getting back to Paris. I had\r\ncounted on returning by way of Nîmes, Clermont-Ferrand, and a little\r\ndétour to see the cathedral of Bourges. But the winds from the mountains\r\nmade Narbonne and Carcassonne cold, the few trains from Nîmes were\r\nunseasonable, my wife declared she had so many cathedrals mixed up in\r\nher head that she could not endure another, and so, leaving Narbonne in\r\nearly morning, we reached Cette ten minutes after the express train for\r\nParis had left, and we came on in omnibus train in unbroken journey,\r\nthrough Montpellier, Nîmes, and Avignon (which we had visited, in former\r\nyears), and via Lyons to Paris. And here we are.\r\n\r\nTwo months of play, delicious play, are up: we landed two months ago\r\nto-morrow. We have had our share, and I have now an appetite for work. I\r\ncan be usefully busy in Paris for a fortnight, hardly longer. Then what?\r\nMuch depends on what you can see your way to. The traditional “three\r\ncourses” seem to be before us, each with its advantages and\r\ndisadvantages; and we are so balanced that we shall be likely to incline\r\nas you push the scale....\r\n\r\nCourse 3. Bear the English winter, if we can’t avoid it, on the\r\nprinciple that “what can’t be cured must be endured.” And with your good\r\nfires and snugness it is not so bad. Secure our lodgings, and we will\r\ncome over to you about the first of the coming month; and I get a solid\r\npiece of work done.\r\n\r\nIf I can utilize the long evenings nothing can be better. Then in March\r\nor early April, when England is apt to be raw and rough, but Italy is\r\nsmiling, we will rush to meet the spring, and return to England when\r\nthat, too, is delightful and its days long and sunny. Note also, that\r\neven an Italian winter may be chilly and damp, and when it is so, there\r\nis no seeing galleries and churches without teeth-chattering and\r\ncold-taking, and it is not easy to get warm lodgings and decent fires.\r\nThis course 3 would suit me best of all; for then we, lingering longer\r\nthan you might be able to take time for, should return to England via\r\nVienna and Berlin, which Mrs. Gray has never seen, and in the latter I\r\nhave Willdenow’s herbarium to potter over.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear old friend, perpend my words (if you can read them; I write\r\non an awkward bit of table), and then have your say.\r\n\r\nHÔTEL ST. ROMAIN, November 21, 1880.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of late has naturally been conducted by our\r\nrespective better halves. I have at length (after giving Cosson two or\r\nthree days to name up his American and Mexican plants) got fairly at\r\nwork at the Jardin des Plantes, and have found (mainly in the herbarium\r\nJussieu) the originals of several of Lamarck’s asters, which gives me\r\nhappiness. They take every pains to accommodate and assist one at the\r\nherbarium. I see old Decaisne at his house; he is not strong.\r\n\r\nI think we shall need two weeks more here, and we hope for better\r\nweather than we have yet had. Colds one always takes at Paris, and Mrs.\r\nGray now has her share. It took a long while to be clear of the one\r\npresented to me on our arrival here in October. But in the south of\r\nSpain my throat was as clear as a whistle. We are not bad just now, and\r\nare hopeful.\r\n\r\nI was perfectly sincere in writing that I should prefer returning to Kew\r\nfor two or three months and to reserve Italy for the early spring. I\r\nshall get more work out of it so. At the same time I was confident that\r\nit would suit you best, and I am glad that you jump at it. It may enable\r\nus to get off the fag end (and best part) of Hayden’s report, if ever he\r\nsends over the portion in type. I am surprised that it has not before\r\nthis come to hand.\r\n\r\nTO MISS A. A. GRAY.\r\n\r\nHÔTEL ST. ROMAIN, PARIS, December 3, 1880.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR A.,--I cannot tell you how much I was touched by your letter of\r\nthe 18th of November, following the round-robin, the letter of Mrs. J.\r\nand that of Charley. And what could have possessed my brothers and\r\nsisters, and nieces, and “their cousins and your aunts” to club together\r\na contribution on the occasion, as if nobody in the family had ever got\r\nto have a seventieth birthday, or ever expected to! Well, it was indeed\r\ntruly good and thoughtful of you all, and it gratified me beyond\r\nmeasure. As you were the organ of the family, upon the occasion, let me\r\nask you to be the medium for conveying to one and all my acknowledgments\r\nand most hearty thanks for their words and deeds and kind thoughts of me\r\nat this interesting time.\r\n\r\nAnd now what I am to do with the presents that have poured in, that is,\r\nwhat am I to present to myself in your name, and keep as a\r\nsouvenir,--that is the question which is exercising my mind. It must be\r\nsomething personal to myself, and I am not much given to personal\r\nadornment, and have few personal wants beyond daily food and clothing,\r\nof which I always say that “the old is better.” But I have got an\r\nidea,--which I will not put on paper yet, because I may change my mind\r\nand not carry it out. You shall see in time.\r\n\r\n“Aunt J.” and I are having a nice time here in Paris, in spite of the\r\nshort and dark days. But we have been very, very busy, each in our way,\r\nand now and then busy in company, as we have been to-day. And then at\r\nevening we come back to our little room, and have the nicest little\r\ndinner together in the little _salle-à-manger_ of our little nice hotel;\r\nor rarely we go out, but never to fare better; and we have been invited\r\nto three dinner parties, each notable and enjoyable in its way. And now\r\nI have to-morrow one more day of botanical work, and then we expect to\r\ngo back on Monday to Kew, and to the lodgings which we occupied a dozen\r\nyears ago. You can write to your aunty directly there: Mrs. Shepherd’s,\r\n“Charlton House,” Kew. Don’t suppose that because it has a name, the\r\nhouse is a grand one. Not a bit of it. But in England, houses, like\r\nbabies, have names given them when they are little.\r\n\r\nGood-by. With dear love to all, along with thanks, I am\r\n\r\nYour affectionate\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. REDFIELD AND CANBY.\r\n\r\nKEW, December 12, 1880.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BRETHREN, REDFIELD AND CANBY,--I think I had a letter from each\r\nof you, and that you had some response from me of some sort (and one or\r\ntwo papers, etc., have come from Redfield), but that was so far back in\r\nmemory when we were staying in Kew before, that it seems to belong to\r\nthat early phase in my existence when I was living on the other side of\r\nthe ocean; and that seems as widely distant in time as the ocean is wide\r\nin space! It is only by the almanac that we know that we left Cambridge\r\nless than three and a half months ago.\r\n\r\nI have not done very much for botany in all that time; but Mrs. Gray and\r\nI have laid in a stock of health and vigor, corporeally, and have filled\r\nour heads with such interesting memories! This and such constant changes\r\nof scene have produced the illusion I refer to, through which, as\r\nthrough a haze, I dimly discern last summer. But out of that haze your\r\nbright and kindly faces look undimmed.\r\n\r\nDid I tell you (I think I did) of the pleasant fortnight here in\r\nSeptember, when guests at Hooker’s; when for botany I worked up\r\nOxytropis; when De Candolle and wife were here, and Bentham--serene old\r\nman--dined with us almost every day; of our crossing one bright day to\r\nParis, and all that?... Thence, abandoning, from lateness of the season,\r\nthe plan of returning through Auvergne, we came on quick via Nîmes,\r\nLyons, etc., to Paris.\r\n\r\nThere Mrs. Gray and I passed three very busy and very charming weeks;\r\nalso doing some good botanical work, and having a good time with\r\nDecaisne and the other botanists at the garden, with Dr. Cosson and M.\r\nLavallée.[115] Then, as the Hookers could not carry out their promise of\r\njoining us and going together to Italy now, we agreed to defer that till\r\nearly spring, and back we came here for work. We are settled in our old\r\nlodgings on Kew Green, where we feel quite at home, and are near the\r\nHookers and the herbarium; and here I am to polish off the\r\nAsteroideæ,--some very rough surfaces in Aster yet to grind down. We\r\nshould be pleased to hear from you.\r\n\r\nIt was at Cordova that I spelled out in Spanish the welcome news that\r\nthe Republicans had carried the election, and grandly.\r\n\r\nAnd now, with Mrs. Gray’s love joined to mine to your good wives and\r\nchildren, I am\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray settled down at Kew for hard work, but as the days were very\r\nshort, and of course the herbarium was closed at dusk, he had long\r\nevenings. There were many pleasant dinners, among others at Mr. John\r\nBall’s, where he met Robert Browning; and a charming visit to Lord Ducie\r\nat Tortworth, where he was much interested in the fine and rare trees,\r\nand had an afternoon’s visit to see Berkeley Castle, one of the oldest,\r\nif not the oldest, of inhabited castles in England. He paid another\r\ninteresting visit to Cambridge, to Professor Babington, where he had not\r\nbeen since his visit in 1851, and where among others he met again Dr.\r\nThompson, then Master of Trinity, who had so kindly received him in\r\n1851. Mr. Lowell was then minister to England, and there were pleasant\r\nmeetings with him.\r\n\r\nIn early March he crossed to Paris, were he was joined by Sir Joseph and\r\nLady Hooker for a journey by Mt. Cenis to Italy, going as far south as\r\nCastellamare and to Amalfi and Pæstum, and returning; short stays in\r\nRome, Florence, and so to Venice, where the party divided, Dr. Gray\r\ngoing to Geneva.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nKEW, December 26, 1880.\r\n\r\n... I am making slow progress with the Asters. The original types of all\r\nthe older species I shall certainly make out; but the limitation of the\r\nspecies presents great, if not insuperable difficulties.\r\n\r\nI have read nearly all of Darwin’s “Power of Movement in Plants.” It is\r\na veritable research, with the details all recorded; and so it is dull\r\nreading. I think it will give the impression to most readers that the\r\nterms “geotropism,” “epinasty,” is “hyponasty,” etc., contain more of\r\nexplanation than in fact they do. Yet now and then a remark should\r\nprevent this, as on page 569, and notably on page 545, at the close of\r\nthe chapter, intimating,--I suppose with reason--that the term “gravity”\r\nor “gravitation” is quite misapplied.\r\n\r\nI have just taken up Wallace’s “Island Life,” and find the earlier\r\nchapters most clear and excellent, but without novelty. The idea of the\r\npersistence of continents is most commonplace in America since Dana’s\r\naddress in (I think) 1845, and I should have thought Wallace would have\r\nknown of the entire prevalence of that view, at least in the western\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nRely on me, dear De Candolle, to keep you _au courant_ with all that\r\nconcerns your friends here, among which always remember your devoted,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nKEW, February 19, 1881.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ENGELMANN,--A few days, or say a week ago, we were gratified by\r\nreceiving your pleasant letter of the 31st January. I hasten to reply\r\nbefore we get afloat again, when writing becomes precarious. Just now\r\nMrs. Gray and I have our evenings together in our quiet lodgings, that\r\nis, whenever we are not dining out or the like, which is pretty often.\r\n\r\nYou know of our movements, then, up to our return here. The Spanish trip\r\nwas very pleasant and successful, and the three weeks afterward in Paris\r\nboth useful and enjoyable. As to botany, it was all given to Aster and\r\nSolidago, at the Jardin des Plantes, and at Cosson’s, who has the\r\nherbarium of Schultz,[116] Bip., which abounds with pickings from many\r\nan herbarium.\r\n\r\nWe got over here early in December, and here I have worked almost every\r\nweek day till now, excepting one short visit down to Gloucestershire,\r\nand a recent trip to Cambridge, where, however, a good piece of three\r\nmornings was devoted to Lindley’s asters. I know the types now of all\r\nthe older species of North American aster, Linnæan, Lamarckian,\r\nAltonian, Willdenovian,[117]--excepting one of Lamarck’s, which I could\r\nnot trace in the old materials at Paris; and Röper writes me that it is\r\nnot in herbarium Lamarck. As to Nees’s asters, most of them are plenty,\r\nas named by him directly or indirectly. But where, on the dispersion of\r\nhis herbarium, the Compositæ went to nobody seems to know, though I have\r\ntried hard to find out. Have you any idea? But he made horrid work with\r\nthe asters, and the Gardens all along, from the very first, have made\r\nconfusion worse confounded. No cultivated specimen, of the older or the\r\npresent time, is _per se_ of any authority whatever. I am deeply\r\nmortified to tell you that, with some little exception, all my botanical\r\nwork for autumn and winter has been given to Aster (after five or six\r\nmonths at home), and they are not done yet! Never was there so rascally\r\na genus! I know at length what the types of the old species are. But how\r\nto settle limits of species, I think I never shall know. There are no\r\ncharacters to go by in the group of Vulgar Asters; the other groups go\r\nvery well. I give to them one more day; not so much to make up my mind\r\nhow to treat a set or two, as how to lay them aside, with some\r\nmemoranda, to try at again on getting home, before beginning to print.\r\nThe group now left to puzzle me is of Western Pacific Rocky Mountain\r\nspecies. The specimens you have collected for me last summer, when I get\r\nthem, may help me; or may reduce me to blank despair!\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nVENICE, May 1, 1881, Sunday.\r\n\r\nAs we propose to leave Venice to-morrow, I think I may say that within\r\nten days you may look to see us in Geneva. The Hookers, with whom we\r\nhave journeyed thus far, will proceed more directly home, after a day or\r\ntwo at the Italian lakes. We propose to follow more leisurely, and, if\r\nthe road is fairly practicable, to cross the Simplon, and so to Geneva,\r\nwhere, according to your suggestion, we will go to the Hôtel des\r\nBergues....\r\n\r\nWe have now been two months in travel, without respite, and for my part\r\nI am fairly sated. I need the change and rest which a week of botanical\r\nresearch in your herbarium, and of intercourse with its owner, will\r\nafford me.\r\n\r\nWe have been as far south as Amalfi and Pæstum. We have attended to the\r\nproper sight-seeing of Naples, Rome, Florence, and Venice, and have\r\ngained novelty by seeing also Orvieto, Cortona, and Siena, likewise\r\nRavenna. We have escaped a disagreeable spring in England, but at the\r\nexpense of being everywhere at least a fortnight too early for the\r\nvarious parts of Italy; and I suppose we shall be all the more sensible\r\nof this at the lakes and in crossing the Alps. But the weather has never\r\nbeen unfavorable, and we have enjoyed much and worked hard. A week near\r\nyou in comparative rest will make an agreeable finale. Our companions\r\nhave added much to the enjoyment, and we are sorry to part with them.\r\nThey would, I know, send their best regards and remembrances, but at\r\nthis moment they are both out; but Mrs. Gray, who is writing by my side,\r\ndesires me to add her own to Madame De Candolle and yourself; and I am\r\nalways most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nLUGANO, May 8, 1881.\r\n\r\n... Mrs. Gray was able to see little of Padua, beyond the Giotto\r\nfrescoes and a look into San Antonio, the interior of which looked\r\nricher than ever. I kept moving; took a turn in the pleasant old Botanic\r\nGarden; found Saccardo;[118] saw two plants of Amorphophallus Rivieri in\r\nblossom; was taken up, by Saccardo’s aid, by Dr. Penzig[119] of Breslau,\r\na gentlemanly young fellow, and of good promise, who took me in hand at\r\nthe garden, university, etc.\r\n\r\nHÔTEL ST. ROMAIN, PARIS, May 22, 1881.\r\n\r\nIf I write you a letter this evening, having nothing else to do till\r\nbedtime, mind, you, who have everything to do, are not bound to do more\r\nthan to read it. Mrs. Gray and Lady Hooker seem to manage correspondence\r\nvery well, and we may take it easy. But I want to tell you what a\r\npleasant and restful week we had at Geneva. The De Candolles were\r\ndelightful. He comes in from Vallon every day at ten, and stays till\r\nhalf past four, and I passed much of the time in the herbarium, where I\r\nhad various old dropped stitches to take up, which I happily\r\naccomplished. As to sociabilities, De Candolle had made a dinner party\r\nfor the very day we arrived (Friday), which I had barely time to get to.\r\nI met there Edouard Naville and his wife, the latter new to me, and a\r\nPourtalès, cousin of our Count Pourtalès, who died last summer, and who,\r\nas a young man, followed Agassiz to the United States, and was a very\r\nimportant man to Alexander Agassiz. His death was severely felt by all\r\nof us. Naville, who is a capital Egyptologist, we knew in Egypt twelve\r\nyears ago, where he was exploring Edfou and monographing one of its\r\nacres of wall sculpture and hieroglyphics, and we met him at De\r\nCandolle’s the next summer. We went out last week to his place at\r\nMarigny, on the north side of the lake, charmingly placed, with a\r\nfull-length view of Mont Blanc in front; the lake in the foreground.\r\n\r\nCasimir and wife are in England; Lucien off at some baths for\r\nrheumatics. But Lucien’s wife was at De Candolle’s, and is a pleasant\r\nlady. On Sunday De Candolle sent in his coupé, and took Mrs. Gray and me\r\nto dinner en famille at Vallon,--only Madame Lucien and some\r\ngrandchildren. Vallon is a very pretty place and the house charming.\r\nMadame De Candolle is lively, even sprightly in her own house, and, I\r\nmay as well tell you, is greatly in love with Lady Hooker. We were sent\r\nhome in the coupé in great style; as also we were on Friday evening\r\nlast, when De Candolle gave us, for parting, a small dinner\r\nparty,--Professors Wartmann and Saussure, and the banker\r\nLombard,--Plantamour, the astronomer, being detained by the stars; his\r\nwife came, however. All these Genevese speak English well, except Madame\r\nDe Candolle, who gets off a little, and what with this and their\r\npleasant ways, we were quite at home with them.\r\n\r\nBoissier had written to us to come down to Valeyres, but he had expected\r\nus earlier. As he was to be off in less than a week, and Mrs. Gray well\r\nused up, on reaching Geneva, we declined, and begged him to come to\r\nGeneva, which he did on Monday, and stayed well into Tuesday. He took me\r\nto his herbarium, which is large and well kept, and I looked up some old\r\nthings of Lagasca’s, which I could find no trace of at Madrid. Barbey I\r\nregretted not to see. He goes with his father-in-law to the Balearic\r\nIsles,--goes, indeed, because he is concerned for Boissier’s health, and\r\nwell he may be.\r\n\r\nArgovian Müller I saw something of; busy and happy in the care of the\r\ngarden, the Delessert herbarium, and the professorship in the new\r\nuniversity, built up with the late Duke of Brunswick’s money. The death\r\nof his only son was a great blow to him; but he seems cheerful and is\r\nvery busy. De Candolle is working over Cultivated Plants and their\r\norigin....\r\n\r\nI see I must go home this autumn, and, indeed, that seems best on almost\r\nall accounts. So I should be at Kew soon, and once there I must set\r\nmyself to work most diligently, and make the most of what time remains.\r\n\r\nI hear nothing as yet of Bentham. I hope he is going on well, and the\r\nGramineæ nearly finished, and that he will next take up Liliaceæ....\r\n\r\nAIX LA CHAPELLE, June 8, 1881.\r\n\r\n... Then we took train on the road down the Moselle (which we had\r\nfollowed from Metz). From Trèves halfway down to Coblentz the country\r\nhad a decidedly American river look; that is, it constantly reminded\r\none of the Mohawk or the Unadilla,--small rivers of my native State and\r\ndistrict, and with just such rounded wooded hills and smooth, well\r\ncultivated slopes, and wide stretches of meadow and grain fields. Then\r\ncame the picturesque portion with precipitous hillsides and crags\r\ncovered with vines wherever a bit of soil could be found to hold them,\r\nextending down to Coblentz. We went on by the railroad down the left\r\nbank of the Rhine to Cologne, which we reached late in the afternoon and\r\nleft at three this P.M.; reached this place at half past four; and while\r\nMrs. Gray rested, I have explored till our half past six dinner hour.\r\nTrèves was an interesting place, though it need not detain one long.\r\nCologne we were glad to see again, and were as much interested in its\r\nold Romanesque churches as in its cathedral,[120] which certainly is\r\nmuch bettered by the completion of the nave and the west front and\r\ntowers,--I may say towers and spires,--for they make nearly all the west\r\nfront. It does not compare with Reims, so far as façade goes....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn reaching Paris in June Dr. Gray met again his old friend Decaisne and\r\nmany others, and there was much pleasant hospitality at the hands of\r\nfriends new and old. He especially enjoyed a day at Verrières, seeing,\r\nin the old home of M. and Mme. de Vilmorin, the dear friends of thirty\r\nyears before, the oldest son Henri with his wife and children, the\r\ngrandchildren of M. and Mme. V. of the corresponding ages and number as\r\nthe family of young people whom he met in the first visit in 1851.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Kew, though the time until leaving late in October was\r\nbusy with steady work, there were pleasant breaks with visits and\r\nexcursions. He had the pleasure of meeting Dean Stanley, first at the\r\nchristening of a daughter of Professor Flower’s, and was to have dined\r\nwith him, but the dinner was postponed on account of a slight\r\nindisposition of the Dean, which developed into his fatal illness.\r\n\r\nThere were many pleasant visits and excursions, some delightful stays in\r\nDevonshire and Somersetshire, when pleasant acquaintances were renewed.\r\nHe spent a few days again at Down with Mr. Darwin, and in August he went\r\nto York for the meeting of the British Association. He stayed with Mr.\r\nBackhouse, the well-known horticulturist, and saw his wonderful\r\nunderground caves of ferns, and his successful alpine garden, and\r\nenjoyed the social as well as the scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nAt Kew he was surrounded with friends, renewing the close intimacy with\r\nhis old and lifelong friend Sir Joseph Hooker; was near his friends at\r\nthe Deanery at St. Paul’s and at Broom House; and he rested now and then\r\nwith a day’s sight-seeing. The days passed all too quickly until the\r\ntime came for breaking up for the return to America. There was a short\r\nstay at Oxford, with Sir Henry Acland, most interesting days, and again\r\nat Manchester at Professor and Mrs. Williamson’s hospitable home, and\r\nthen the voyage to America, when he landed early in November.\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CANBY AND REDFIELD.\r\n\r\nKEW, July 15, 1881.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR OLD FRIENDS, CANBY AND REDFIELD,--How very long it is since you\r\nhave heard, at least directly, from your Old World wanderers! How long\r\nand from whence, is more than I can tell. I use now an enforced half\r\nhour before an engagement, and when it is, would you believe it for\r\nEngland? too hot to go across the Green to use the half hour at the\r\nherbarium, where I have sweltered all the morning, regular Philadelphia\r\nheat, and this is the third day of this the second heated term.\r\n\r\nI wrote you from Italy, I think.\r\n\r\n... It is hopeless now to try to give any narration of our doings. The\r\nflavor would have all evaporated in the attempt to recall and review the\r\npast spring.\r\n\r\nI think you know our routes, from Paris in March to Turin, to Genoa,\r\nPisa, Rome, Naples, and the country around, Amalfi and Pæstum our most\r\nsouthern points; then Rome again and a twelve days’ stay, then a run to\r\nOrvieto and Cortona on the route to Florence, a visit to Siena from\r\nFlorence, a detour from Bologna to Ravenna, most old-world of towns,\r\nthence to Venice, a week only. And as we left it, the Hookers, whose\r\nfurlough was running out, dropped us at Padua, whence, passing Verona,\r\nwhere we had been before, we had a day at Brescia, thence to Milan, Como\r\nand up the lake, and over to Lugano, and back to Milan. Thence to Arona\r\nat foot of Lake Maggiore, and a drive all the way up to Domo d’Ossola,\r\nand then diligence over the Simplon pass and through the snow, and down\r\nto Brieg, and on to Martigny to sleep, and then on to Geneva, where we\r\npassed a delicious week, with De Candolle and other friends to enjoy,\r\nand a little botany to attend to in the herbarium. And then in one day\r\nwe went to Paris, and stayed three weeks, while Mrs. Gray did her\r\nfeminine matters, and I a deal of botany work, and both a little\r\nsight-seeing. Thence, sending our luggage before to London, we swung off\r\nfor Soissons and the old castle of Coucy, and Reims, and Trèves, and\r\ndown the Moselle to Coblentz, and the Rhine (that is, by rail) to\r\nCologne, to enjoy the finished cathedral; thence to Aix la Chapelle, to\r\nBruxelles, and then, with a fine day and smooth water, over to England;\r\nand here at Kew we have been settled ever since, engaging in a deal of\r\nbotanical work and a deal of society in a most agreeable way, and a\r\nlittle (thus far only a little) sight-seeing. As we come towards the\r\nend, we grow busier every day, and count the time closer. For we expect\r\nto return in October, to reach home (_Deo favente_) either at the end of\r\nthat month or before the middle of November; the day and vessel not yet\r\nquite fixed....\r\n\r\nThere are lots of things to write about, but the sheet is full, and I\r\nmust only say I am\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nRICHMOND HOUSE, KEW.\r\n\r\n... It is really serious, this leaving England, and choice friends in\r\nit, when one considers that, whatever I may fondly say, I cannot expect\r\nto see it again,--I do not say _them_.\r\n\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, MASS., November 14, 1881.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--Dr. Holmes is a good soul, and has just sent me the\r\ninclosed for the autograph which I promised H. I wish she, and\r\nespecially that M., could be here now, to enjoy our exquisite dry and\r\nstimulating air, which, with American oysters, should set her up\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nI have missed Freeman. He had gout and some other engagements, which\r\ntook him from Boston the day before we landed. My critical friends at\r\nCambridge say that his lectures were disappointing. They say he took no\r\npains in preparation, or at least fell into the common habit of your\r\ncountrymen when they come here, that is, of giving lectures and water.\r\nThe Bostonians prefer, and appreciate, something more concentrated and\r\nhigher proof.\r\n\r\nI do hope you will promise Mr. Lowell a course of lectures, few or more,\r\nnext October.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Lowell lectures requires that courses shall be\r\ndelivered, as often as possible, on subjects pertaining to Christianity,\r\nnatural religion, etc., which may come as near to sermons as you like.\r\nPray do not decline the invitation offhand. You would have a most\r\nappreciative audience. You see we are counting upon you, with two\r\ndaughters at least, for the next summer and autumn. In haste to save the\r\npost,\r\n\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 13, 1881.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR OLD FRIEND,--It is shabby of me to wait so long in response to\r\nyour kindly greetings, which were dated on my birthday, November 18.\r\nBut I was very busy when it came, and hardly less so since, and so I let\r\nit get out of sight.\r\n\r\nWell, here we are once more, leaving dear friends on the other side, and\r\nnow among our own kith and kin.\r\n\r\nGlad to hear of your pleasant summer, and pretty good health now.\r\n\r\nWe had a favorable voyage home, which is more than those just before\r\ncould say, and far more than any since....\r\n\r\nNees’s asters, of his own herbarium, I can nowhere find or hear of. But\r\nI don’t believe his herbarium (which was sold piecemeal) would have\r\nhelped me much, considering how he has named asters for other\r\nherbaria....\r\n\r\nAccumulated collections, of Lemmon, Parish,[121] Cusick,[122] etc.,\r\nespecially have taken all my time up to now, after getting my home in\r\norder, a deal of trouble. And now I can think of getting at my “Flora”\r\nwork again.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I am to make complete as I can my manuscript for Solidago\r\nand Aster. Solidago I always find rather hopeful. Aster, as to the\r\n_Asteres genuini_, is my utter despair! Still I can work my way through\r\nexcept for the Rocky Mountain Pacific species.\r\n\r\nI will try them once more, though I see not how to limit species, and to\r\ndescribe specimens is endless and hopeless. So send on your things. But\r\nfirst I am to print, _pari passu_ with my final elaboration, an article,\r\n“Studies in Solidago and Aster,”--taking the former first, giving an\r\naccount of what I have made out in the old herbaria, stating\r\ninvestigations which I can only give the condensed result of in the\r\n“Flora,” etc. Considerable change as to some old species.\r\n\r\nWhen I have done the Solidago, then Aster in that way....\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 29, 1881.\r\n\r\nI am doubtful if I have written to you since our return, and my New Year\r\ngreetings will reach you somewhat late, but are very hearty. I could\r\nhardly have neglected to send you word of the satisfaction with which we\r\nlook upon the fine bust of your father, which stands at one end of our\r\nherbarium; Robert Brown and William J. Hooker at the other, and your\r\nlithographic portrait overhead is replaced by the more striking\r\nphotograph you gave us.\r\n\r\nAt length we are settled in our home; have had for the twenty-fifth time\r\nthe annual Christmas family gathering, for which my study, being the\r\nlargest room in the house, is always upturned and emptied, and I should\r\nbe quietly at work upon the Compositæ, were it not for an attack of\r\nlumbago, that uncomfortable attendant of old age, which just now\r\ninterferes with my activity, without actually laying me up.... We, Mr.\r\nWatson and I, are still much occupied with the distribution, and\r\ntherefore in good part the study, of the recent collections which have\r\naccumulated here and are still coming in. Much valuable time do they\r\nconsume. The most interesting are from Arizona, etc., near the Mexican\r\nfrontier, among which those we have most to do with are by Lemmon and by\r\nPringle.[123] The former, I know,--and I shall soon know as to the\r\nlatter,--has sets to dispose of, and I think you would like to have\r\nthem. We formerly have taken a deal of trouble in assisting such\r\ncollectors in the disposal of their plants offered for sale, but we are\r\nobliged now to leave aside such affairs, as they consume too much time.\r\n\r\nI have no other botanical news for you. Dr. Engelmann, who of late has\r\nroamed a good deal, is now at home, and busy with botanical work, of\r\nvarious sorts, Isoetes, Cupressus, etc. It is quite probable that he\r\nwill cross the ocean again next spring, in which case you will probably\r\nsee him. Professor Sargent is busy with his forest reports in connection\r\nwith the United States Census of 1880. Mr. Watson in this service made a\r\nlong journey through our northwest region, while I was in Europe, at too\r\nlate a season for much ordinary botany; and he has been otherwise too\r\nbusy since his return even to look over his collections.\r\n\r\nMy colleague, Professor Goodale, giving over to Professor Farlow the\r\nuniversity lectures, etc., is now abroad with his whole family, to\r\nrecruit health and acquire information. You will see him at Geneva in\r\nspring or summer, and I commend him to you as a dear friend and a very\r\nvaluable man. My wife joins me in kind remembrances and best New Year\r\nwishes to Madame De Candolle and yourself, and I am always your devoted\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 25, 1881.\r\n\r\n... I am kept indoors this pleasant Christmas Sunday, which is here as\r\nfine and bright a day as was the Christmas of last year, which we\r\npassed with you, and which comes up fresh to our memories....\r\n\r\nI have just cleared off the portion of accessions to herbarium which had\r\naccumulated here and which I had myself to see to, and am settling down\r\nto my Compositous work. And now I am taking an oath that when I do get\r\nabout them I will hold on to the bitter end, that is, I suppose till I\r\nreach the Wormwoods. And now I must go to Washington on the 18th prox.\r\nfor meeting of Smithsonian regents....\r\n\r\nSargent has got his arboretum at length on to the hands of the city of\r\nBoston to make the roads for, to repair and to light and police. He\r\nseems to have made a mark in his Census forestry work. He has developed\r\nnot only a power of doing work, but of getting work done for him by\r\nother people, and so can accomplish something.\r\n\r\nJanuary 27, 1882.\r\n\r\n... My whole soul is in the “Flora of North America,” but the new things\r\nthat come in, owing to opening of Arizona and other railways, and which\r\nhave to be seen to, keep Watson and myself so busy. So our movement is\r\nlike marking time four days to going ahead one....\r\n\r\nEngelmann promises to make us a visit in the spring. How I shall make\r\nhim work! No other news just now.\r\n\r\nTO SIR EDWARD FRY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 26, 1882.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR EDWARD,--It is high time that I thanked you for a very\r\npleasant letter which at the beginning of the year you kindly wrote me\r\nfrom Failand House, a place which is very green in our memories. It\r\nreached us at Washington, where, with Mrs. Gray as my inseparable\r\ncompanion, I went to attend the annual meeting of the regents of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. We were away from home little more than a week,\r\nand even in that time we managed to bring in a little visit to friends\r\nin Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThis miserable trial of Guiteau, of which you already knew unpleasant\r\nparticulars, was still in progress; but I did not go near the\r\ncourt-room, and could not readily have been induced to do so. The day\r\nafter I received your letter I met an acquaintance, one of the judges of\r\nthe Court of Claims (a court for trying claims against the United States\r\ngovernment preferred by citizens or others, and much is it to be wished\r\nthat a mass of claims presented to Congress and cumbering its committees\r\ncould be passed over to this court), and I drew him into conversation\r\nupon the scandal which the trial was causing. He spoke of Judge Cox as a\r\nman of ability and high character, referred to the impossibility of\r\nshutting the prisoner’s mouth, the expectation that the man’s prolonged\r\nrevelation of himself before the jury would throw more light upon the\r\ncase than any amount of expert testimony, which I think was expected to\r\nbe more contradictory than it actually was, and of the determination to\r\nleave no ground for the ordering of a new trial. My friend told me he\r\nhad been twice in the courtroom, thought the judge might and should have\r\nexercised more control, yet that what he saw and heard did not appear to\r\nhim at the time so indecorous and offensive as it appeared when\r\npresented in the newspapers. Indeed, this sensational newspaper\r\nreporting is a huge nuisance, and in respect to these matters our\r\nhighest-class daily papers are little better than the lowest. I suppose\r\nthe telegraph reporting for the press is all done by one set of men, and\r\nthe more sensational the reports the more welcome to the papers, which,\r\nwith few exceptions, print without any selection or discrimination.\r\n\r\nI have settled down to my work with enjoyment, but with a growing sense\r\nof discouragement growing out of an _embarras de richesses_. It was\r\nnatural to find here a great accumulation of collections of North\r\nAmerican plants, all needing examination; but unfortunately, they\r\ncontinue to come in faster than I can study and dispose of them. This\r\ncomes from the increasing number of botanical explorers, and the new\r\nfacilities offered to them by new railroads along our southwestern\r\nfrontiers and other out-of-the-way regions. The consequence is, that\r\nwhile new and interesting things are pouring in, which one must attend\r\nto, and which are very enjoyable, I do not get ahead with the steady and\r\nformidable work of the “North American Flora.” I begin to think it were\r\na happier lot to have the comparatively completed botany of an old\r\ncountry to study, in which your work “were done when ’twere done,” and\r\nin which, even if it were not done quickly, you were not called on to do\r\nit over and over, to bring the new into shape and symmetry with the old.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I finally wrote out an article on a question which you once\r\ntreated, and upon which we more than once conversed, taking for my text\r\na paragraph in Lubbock’s address at York last summer. I had partly\r\npromised Mr. Walter Browne to write it, so I sent it to him; and as a\r\nproof from the “Contemporary Review” has come back to me, I suppose it\r\nmay be printed before long.[124] I shall be curious to know what you\r\nthink of it.\r\n\r\nI sent you a portion of a New York religious newspaper containing a sort\r\nof review of two books with which I beguiled the voyage last October or\r\nNovember. It is of no great consequence. But I sometimes write such\r\nreviews or articles to papers of this kind, which are endeavoring to do\r\ntheir best in bridging over the gap between the thoughts of a former\r\ngeneration, or of our younger days, and of the present day. I believe\r\nsuch articles are now and then helpful.\r\n\r\nYou supposed that I had seen the “Lyell’s Life and Letters” sooner than\r\nI had. To my surprise the volumes are not reprinted in America; and I\r\nhave only just succeeded in procuring a copy from England.\r\n\r\nI have read a good deal of it, and with much interest. The allusion to\r\nme, which you referred to, was of course very pleasant. The last chapter\r\nof the “Antiquity of Man” had apprised me (for I never had any direct\r\ncorrespondence with Lyell) that we thought much alike on such matters;\r\nand we are apt to approve views which agree with our own. I always\r\nthought Lyell a very level-headed man,--one with a very judicial turn of\r\nmind; and his letters and journal bring this out well, as they do the\r\nwhole life and the charming character of the man. It is interesting to\r\nsee how early he took the line which he followed in his whole life’s\r\nwork, and which has changed the face of geology and philosophical\r\nnatural history. For, indeed, Lyell is as much the father of the new\r\nmode of thought which now prevails as is Darwin. I have said a word\r\nabout this, which I will try to send you.\r\n\r\nThat is a noble letter to Mr. Spedding, about the American war. We knew\r\nthat was in him. During the time of trouble, our then minister in\r\nLondon, Mr. Adams, and Mrs. Adams used to say that Sir Charles and Lady\r\nLyell were almost their only, and their very stanch and efficient\r\nsupporters.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to know who the author of “The New Analogy,” by Cellarius,\r\nis, I beg you will let me know. Although as a whole it may not amount to\r\nmuch, there are some capital hits in it.\r\n\r\nI have been writing you a monstrously long letter. I have only space to\r\nask you to give my kind remembrances to Lady Fry and the young people,\r\nof all whom we have such happy memories.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nMarch 16, 1882.\r\n\r\n... Your letter of the 25th of February tells me of the will of dear\r\nDecaisne, whom we shall miss greatly. The main disadvantage of our years\r\nis in these losses, which to us are never made up. He was a very true\r\nfriend....\r\n\r\nI am glad you will make a supplement to the “Lois.” When you have it in\r\nhand I wish you would communicate to me, in letter, your main points on\r\nthe critical questions. You, Bentham, and I are most in accord; and we\r\nought to agree, essentially. Upon any critical points, I had much rather\r\nmake my comments, for whatever they may be worth, before you print than\r\nafterwards. I have kept phænogamous botany essentially orthodox in the\r\nUnited States....\r\n\r\nMay 15.\r\n\r\n... It is now all but a year since Mrs. Gray and I had that charming\r\nweek at Geneva!\r\n\r\nMuch has happened since then. We have lost dear old Decaisne; and now\r\nDarwin! We hardly should have thought, twenty-five years ago, that he\r\nwould have made such an impression upon the great world, as well as on\r\nthe scientific world!\r\n\r\nI do not know if you ever saw much of him. He was a very charming man.\r\n\r\nHere we have lost, at a good age, both Longfellow and Emerson.\r\n\r\nI have been anxious about Bentham, from whom there were discouraging\r\naccounts; but his last letters are hopeful, and he is steadily at work.\r\nLet me hope, and let me know, that you are quite well; also Madame De\r\nCandolle.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, September 17, 1882.\r\n\r\n... At Montreal we were guests of Dawson, who wanted to return some\r\nhospitality we had afforded him and his daughter.... Dawson has toiled\r\nfor a lifetime at Montreal, under many discouragements, has accomplished\r\na deal, and deserves great credit.\r\n\r\n... We had a pleasant time, and this fortnight in Canada was my only\r\nvacation. I went to visit the grave of Pursh, who died at forty-six.\r\nThey have put his bones in their pretty cemetery, and put a neat stone\r\nover them....\r\n\r\nGlad you are to send me scraps of one or more species of Dyer. It should\r\nhave been a tinctorial genus....\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nOctober 8, 1882.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that I have not responded by a line to your letter of\r\nApril 13, yet I think my wife has written more than once to the\r\nDeanery, and we have had good accounts of the visit to Italy, which\r\nappears to have been a great enjoyment to all of you. And now we have\r\nthe news of H.’s engagement, which must give you a novel sensation. How\r\ntime flies and events develop! It seems but a little while since she and\r\nher sisters were little girls at Whatley. And now, when this reaches\r\nyou, a year will have gone round since we said goodby in London.\r\n\r\nI have not much to say nor to show for this year. Though I have never\r\nworked more steadily, and never with so much concentration, there seems\r\nto be little to show for it. At times I am disheartened, but a hope as\r\nirrepressible as I suppose it is unreasonable and extravagant bears me\r\nup and on. There is, indeed, a good pile of manuscript to show, but I\r\nwill not begin printing until I have gone through with the vast order of\r\nCompositæ. That may be at Christmas,--I may say I expect it,--but I\r\nnever yet came up to any such expectation. To give you some idea of what\r\nmy task is, I hope to send you soon a copy of an exhortation which I\r\nread to the botanists at the recent meeting of our American Association\r\nfor Advancement of Science at Montreal (in the Queen’s dominions!) This\r\njourney to Canada was my only holiday this past summer; though Mrs. Gray\r\ngot as much more, with her brothers and sisters at Beverly, on the\r\ncoast; a bit of country and of country life we are longing to have you\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nThe gathering at Montreal was most pleasant, and we were happily placed\r\nas the guests of the president of the year, Dr. Dawson, principal of\r\nMcGill College, at which the sessions were held. Among the foreign\r\nsavants, we had ... Rev. and also M. D. Professor Haughton, of Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, a man of very varied knowledge, ... a somewhat\r\nrollicking companion, which, however, did not hinder his preaching a\r\ngoodly and serious sermon in the Cathedral on Sunday; I believe rather\r\neminent in mathematics, and who has done a good piece of\r\nphysico-physiological work on muscular power. But what took me by\r\nsurprise was his intense, truly Irish hatred of England, and of\r\nGladstone in particular. Probably he did not like the disestablishment\r\nof the Irish church.\r\n\r\nAnd as to Ireland,--what a year you have had, and only dim hopes that\r\nthe next will be better; I do hope Gladstone will hold on and hold out.\r\nThe Egyptian affair, as it turns out, must strengthen his administration\r\nnot a little. Ever since we were in Egypt, I have been longing to have\r\nEngland take the control of that country, as the only hope of the\r\nfellahs and Copts,--the only people there for whom one has any sympathy.\r\n\r\nI was to write you about the great brimming St. Lawrence, and of our\r\ntrip down it to the Saguenay. But Mrs. Gray will be writing all that,\r\nand also giving my hearty good wishes to H., dear soul. But I have not\r\nleft room even to say how sincerely I remain,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately and truly,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nDecember 11.\r\n\r\nYou ought to have heard from me before this, but you have probably got\r\ninformation indirectly of my little mishap, which may account for not\r\nwriting with my own hand. Not a quite sufficient excuse; for at much\r\ninconvenience I managed very soon to do some writing, in awkward\r\nfashion, as well as to turn over specimens; otherwise I should have been\r\nunhappy.\r\n\r\nWell, hard upon six weeks ago, I managed to break the top of my right\r\nshoulder-blade. It was done by a bit of carelessness, not to say\r\nfoolhardiness, by continuing to do at seventy-two what I have done in\r\nformer years, relying too much on my quickness and sureness of foot in\r\nstepping off a horse-car (_anglice_, tram) when in motion. In the\r\ndarkness I supposed it had slowed up, which in fact it had not, and so a\r\nbad fall. Well, the bone is thought to be well mended, and I use the arm\r\nfor certain purposes almost as well as ever, but cannot yet get my\r\nclothes on and off without assistance. My wife, as you will believe, has\r\nbeen a capital nurse, and she credits me with a most unexpected amount\r\nof patience....\r\n\r\nBut if you don’t come soon I shall despair of you. And Gladstone, I\r\nknow, will be tempting you; but I doubt if you will budge, except he\r\nwould place you in more sunny quarters than the Deanery,--a place which\r\ncorporeally I know is not at all good for you, nor for Mrs. Church.\r\n\r\nI read that you have preached a sermon in commemoration of Dr. Pusey, at\r\nOxford, which I hope you will print, and I count on receiving a copy. I\r\nprize very much a copy of a discourse by Dr. Pusey, given me through\r\nAcland when we were there a year and a quarter ago, addressed to me in a\r\nvery flattering way.\r\n\r\nBy the telegraph we learn you are having a very severe snowstorm,\r\nattended with suffering. We are now having our sixth of this winter; but\r\nwe do not mind it.\r\n\r\nI rejoice with you at Gladstone’s success. He and Dufferin have earned\r\nlaurels. Let us hope he will hold out several years yet, and continue at\r\nthe helm. But how cordially he is hated!\r\n\r\nHere we get on, prosper, indeed, quite without wisdom, or with very\r\nlittle of it. One of these days we shall need it. There are things I\r\nshould like to write about. But my arm is not up to continued use.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gray will send messages _propria manu_. So, with my kindest regards\r\nto Mrs. Church and all your happy family, I am affectionately,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO SIR EDWARD FRY.\r\n\r\nBEVERLY FARMS, December 1, 1882.\r\n\r\nWe were very sorry to read in the telegraphic news a few days ago of the\r\ndestruction of Clevedon Court by fire, a most sad and unexpected thing,\r\nbut we hope not so bad as the brief announcement portends. It brought\r\nback to our memory the delightful afternoon which Mrs. Gray and I passed\r\nthere a year and some months ago. A modern house can be replaced, but\r\nnot an old hall like this. It makes us sad to think of it. Perhaps you\r\ncan tell us that the loss was exaggerated in the telegraphic account.\r\n\r\nI am writing from the house of Mrs. Gray’s brother, on the seashore,\r\nwhere we are passing the “Thanksgiving” holiday. “Thanksgiving Day” is a\r\nPuritan institution, was formerly confined to New England and the\r\ndistricts settled by New Englanders, and has been kept from the time of\r\nthe landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, and is annually appointed by\r\nthe governors of these States by proclamation. But within the last\r\nfifteen or twenty years it has become national, and the day, the fourth\r\nor the last Thursday in November, is announced by a proclamation by the\r\nPresident. In New England it long took the place of Christmas, for which\r\nyou know the Puritans had no liking, and was the chief family\r\ngathering-day as well as a day of religious service, or at least of\r\npolitical sermonizing. But Christmas is completely restored even in New\r\nEngland, though the other holiday is not dropped.\r\n\r\nThe north shore of Massachusetts Bay is very pretty, the shore backed\r\nwith woods and rocks, and sheltered against the northeast bleak winds;\r\nand the situation where we are is one of the choicest. It is near the\r\nmouth of Salem Bay, Salem at the head, three or four miles above, and\r\nthe hills beyond close the view at the west; the peninsula of Marblehead\r\nlies opposite on the south, dividing this water from that of Boston Bay;\r\nsoutheast the sea-line is broken only by three or four low islands. When\r\nmy good father-in-law bought the land here, then waste wood and\r\nsheep-pasture, forty years and more ago, it was two or three hours from\r\nBoston. Now a railway brings it within an hour, and now the whole coast\r\ndown to Cape Ann is occupied with what you would call villa residences,\r\nthe grounds of all the most desirable ones reaching to the water, partly\r\nwith rocky shores wooded with pine-trees and junipers, partly with sandy\r\nbeaches, good for bathing-grounds. This place combines the two, and is\r\nwell wooded at the back, and commands the most beautiful views. Most of\r\nthe houses are used only for summer residences; but this is occupied the\r\nyear round. I have never been here in the winter before. Winter we are\r\nhere in the midst of already, unusually early, and the ground is white\r\nwith snow, of which there is usually little before Christmas. But our\r\nwinter differs from yours in its sunshine, the brilliancy and cheer of\r\nwhich is a good offset for the colder weather, or at least the lower\r\nthermometer.\r\n\r\nA good number of our English acquaintances have been over this autumn.\r\nDr. and Mrs. Carpenter are among the last to return. He has just closed\r\na popular course of Lowell lectures, and they go back a week or two\r\nhence. One hardly knows what brought Herbert Spencer. He seems most to\r\nhave enjoyed Niagara, where he stayed a week. I do not think the dinner\r\ndemonstration for him at New York amounted to very much; nor do I take\r\nstock in the statement, the truth of which he took for granted, that the\r\nhair turns gray in the United States ten years earlier than in England.\r\nI should say the only difference is, that there is more hair remaining\r\nhere to turn gray at middle age or later. Spencer also told us of a\r\ndiscovery he had made, that all Americans had the outer corners of their\r\neyes lower than the inner, the opposite of our antipodes, the Mongols.\r\n\r\nI have just returned from a “sleigh ride.” Snow, though a nuisance in\r\ntowns, is a convenience in the country, greatly facilitating travel, and\r\na drive upon runners instead of wheels, well wrapped in furs and with\r\nbuffalo robes, is much enjoyed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of August, Mrs. Gray and I went to Montreal, to the meeting\r\nof the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where we\r\nwere guests of the president, Dr. Dawson. We made an excursion to\r\nOttawa, the new seat of government, and another down the noble St.\r\nLawrence and up its picturesque tributary, the Saguenay. Otherwise we\r\nhave been at home all the summer and autumn. And so we expect to be all\r\nwinter, save perhaps a week in Washington.\r\n\r\n... I think I have long owed your son Portsmouth a letter, but, though I\r\nshould be glad to hear from him, and to know how he is getting on at\r\nOxford, I cannot pay my debt to him to-day. And some twinges tell me\r\nthat it is time to spare you.\r\n\r\nI will just add that what we hear prepares us to expect that before this\r\nreaches you, or even leaves this country, we may hear that the good and\r\nwise Archbishop of Canterbury will have gone to his rest; and Gladstone\r\nwill have a most responsible as well as the most dignified position to\r\nfill.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 17, 1882.\r\n\r\nI must not let the New Year come to you without repairing my delay in\r\nthe way of letter-writing, and sending you greeting and good wishes for\r\nthe season. Especially I may congratulate you and felicitate ourselves,\r\nthat is, we botanists, that you have, or will have, brought your _opus\r\nmagnum_ to a completion!--proof-reading excepted. A great thing to have\r\ndone. I did not make reply to your last of October 14, because I really\r\ncould say nothing about the Eriocauloneæ....\r\n\r\nYes, I have De Candolle on Cultivated Plants, and am well pleased with\r\nit, so far as I have looked it over.\r\n\r\nThanks for your complimentary mention of my notice of Darwin. I have\r\nsince sent you another brochure, an exhortation to my botanical\r\ncompatriots to have more consideration for my time, considering how\r\nlittle is left, and what a deal of use I have for it. I can hope only to\r\npalliate the evil a little.\r\n\r\nYour life has been a most enviable one, in being able so to arrange and\r\ncontrol your time, and with your indomitable industry, perseverance, and\r\njudgment, you have turned your opportunities to full account, winning\r\nno end of gratitude and admiration. Now, do take the relaxation and\r\nrepose which you have so completely earned; and take, as you may, great\r\nsatisfaction and pride in all you have accomplished. At least your many\r\nfriends will do so....\r\n\r\nI did hope to have got to the end of the Compositæ with the end of 1882;\r\nbut I shall hardly do more than finish the Helenioideæ. As I go on, I\r\nstudy all Mexican border things, at least these of our North American\r\ncollectors.\r\n\r\nMy health is excellent; so I may fairly hope to get the North American\r\nCompositæ off my hands and in print, barring accidents, and I shall be\r\ncareful of my bones, and other contingencies....\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nMay 1, 1883.\r\n\r\n... I have not read Carlyle’s Life, by Froude, but many articles, in\r\nwhich of course the points are mostly given. All seem to agree that\r\nFroude has blackened the memory of Carlyle irrecoverably, or rather with\r\nrude hand wiped off the whitewash which covered the blackness. He was a\r\nrude, unkempt soul. From the extracts I have seen, I fancy that Mrs.\r\nCarlyle’s letters beat Carlyle’s all out for raciness and pith.\r\n\r\nI am content with the Romane correspondence as R. leaves it, and pleased\r\nwith Romane’s tone, which I will try to tell him.\r\n\r\nI think his first reply was a “beating of the air.” And for that reason\r\nI returned to the charge. His second is to the purpose. And he seems to\r\nfeel that mine was to the purpose also.\r\n\r\n... As to dear Bentham, his life is the very ideal of a naturalist’s\r\nlife, and I have always regarded it one of the happiest possible and one\r\nof the most successful.... His administration of the Linnæan, his series\r\nof addresses, etc., will be looked back to as an oasis in the desert.\r\n\r\nOur spring is late; the winter, or rather the drought of the previous\r\nautumn, has been deadly on perennials, herbs and shrubs....\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nMay 22, 1883.\r\n\r\n... I wish to condole with you over a hardship which you write of, that\r\nof having to write a book on Lord Bacon. I quite understand that you\r\nshould bemoan your fate at being drawn into that undertaking. I cannot\r\nthink it at all to your liking. Bacon, of all people, if the best is to\r\nbe made of him, I fancy, should be written of by a worldly-wise, if not\r\na worldly-minded man. Moreover, I must confess to a heretical opinion as\r\nto another side of Bacon, that in which English, and all\r\nEnglish-speaking, people glory. To blab it out: I have an ugly notion\r\nthat he was rather a sciologist than a man of science, and that he\r\nreally did nothing of real consequence for the furtherance of science;\r\nnothing to be compared with Galileo, a real father of “inductive\r\nphilosophy” and scientific investigation--and Pascal. By the way, taking\r\nthe two men all round, do you not think a taking parallel could be run\r\nwith Bacon and Pascal?\r\n\r\nNow, to change the subject,--what a noble old man Gladstone is, and what\r\na great name he is going to leave as a high-minded statesman! I could\r\nenvy you, if it were in my way, the privilege of his friendship.\r\n\r\nH. was so good as to write me a charming letter from her new home, for\r\nwhich please give her my thanks.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you see our observatory director, Pickering, you will\r\nfind him an unaffected man, wise in science above his years.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, September 3, 1883.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--A letter of yours of July 24 has been on my table a\r\ngood while, and now to-day comes yours of August 22. So I am to write\r\nyou at once, urged thereto mainly by your quandary about subspecies,\r\nvarieties, and how to manage them in a popular flora like the British,\r\nin which forms need to be distinguished more than in outlandish floras.\r\n\r\nI have a decided opinion as to the form of treatment, and from your\r\nletter, as well as I can gather, I coincide with Ball. At least, I would\r\nnot have subspecies. They are, as the saying goes, “neither flesh, fowl,\r\nnor good red herring.”\r\n\r\nSome you would accept as species; make of the rest varieties, with\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nIn characterizing species having marked varieties, should the specific\r\ncharacter comprehend the forms or varieties, and then there be a “var.\r\na” or type, or “typical form?”\r\n\r\nI thought over this when I began my “Synoptical Flora,” and concluded\r\nthat it was best to characterize the species on its genuine\r\nrepresentatives only. Of course as far as practicable, and indeed for\r\nall but some special points, the characters will, and should, cover the\r\nwhole. And at the end of the character, you have only to add, the type\r\nof the species has so and so; then the variety or varieties with the\r\nspecial differentia.\r\n\r\nFrom pretty large practice I find this works best, and probably your\r\nexperience will have brought you to the same conclusion....\r\n\r\n“Liberavi animum meum,” and it may go for what you find it worth.... I\r\ndid not know that “Americans,” i. e., good Americans, did say, “so and\r\nso intermarried with so and so.” I see Ravenel, a Carolinian, says so.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, September 25, 1883.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BENTHAM,--I am so glad to receive a letter giving so comfortable\r\nan account of yourself; glad also that you would like to hear from me;\r\nglad to announce that, though there are still some genera to revise, I\r\ncan tell you that I am about to begin the printing of the “Synoptical\r\nFlora,” containing Caprifoliaceæ-Compositæ,--which when done, I shall\r\nfeel something of the relief you must have had when the “Genera” was off\r\nyour hands. That done, I look, with only that mitigated confidence that\r\nbecomes an old man, for a bit of holiday, such as is always\r\nreinvigorating to Mrs. Gray and myself. I am so sorry you had to take up\r\nwith a sick-room instead. But as you are now picking up finely, could\r\nyou not be made comfortable and get rid of an English November and\r\nDecember by revisiting the scenes of your youth in the south of\r\nFrance?...\r\n\r\nI think I sent you Trumbull’s[125] (mostly) and my annotations on De\r\nCandolle’s “L’Origine des Plantes Cultivées.” If not, let me know, for\r\nyou have leisure to read now.\r\n\r\nI am busy with an article on De Candolle’s “Nouvelles Remarques sur la\r\nNomenclature.” As it may be my last say on the subject, I am going to\r\nmake a rather elaborate article on nomenclatural and phytographical\r\npoints, mostly small points, some of which I should have liked to confer\r\nwith you about. I would have done so, but I feared, in the reported\r\nstate of your health, to trouble you.\r\n\r\nThere are two or three small points, about name-citation and\r\nname-making, upon which I shall venture to criticise the “Genera\r\nPlantarum.” But in almost everything we are in full accord, as you know,\r\nand I wish to impress the accordance upon the younger botanists of the\r\nUnited States. Nowadays, more than formerly, they get hold of many\r\nbooks, German and other--books, many of them, better for substance than\r\nfor form; and so our botanists need guidance and some show of authority.\r\n\r\nEngelmann has come home, looking far better than we expected, or than he\r\nthought to be; is visiting Sargent, and will soon come to us....\r\n\r\nTO SIR EDWARD FRY.\r\n\r\nNovember 10, 1883.\r\n\r\nIn a line which I remember adding to Mrs. Gray’s last letter to Lady Fry\r\nI expressed a hope and confident expectation that we should have done\r\nwith General Butler as governor of Massachusetts. The election occurred\r\nlast Tuesday; an extraordinarily large vote was cast: Butler was\r\ndefeated by 10,000, and an excellent man, a member of Congress from the\r\ncentral part of the State, a lawyer, who makes considerable sacrifice in\r\ntaking the governorship, is chosen in his place, and there is a majority\r\nof two thirds in both branches of the legislature to support him. We\r\nhope that this makes an end of Butler’s power for harm, or at least\r\ncripples it. He is a desperate demagogue....\r\n\r\nI doubt if either of the friends you mentioned came to Cambridge at all.\r\nMy friend Agassiz had the pleasure of meeting them at Newport, and was\r\ngreatly taken with them....\r\n\r\nI am beginning to print the Compositæ for my “Flora of North America;”\r\nand am revising for the last time some of the more difficult and more\r\nunsatisfactory portions. My wife now excuses me to her friends for\r\noutbreaks of ill-humor, the excuse being that I am at present “in the\r\nvalley of the shadow of the Asters.” This is “sic itur ad astra,” with a\r\nvengeance. If only I can have done with the printer by the close of the\r\nwinter months, with any life left in me, then we will go in for a\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nI am very well, and Mrs. Gray passably so. We have seen just a little of\r\nMatthew Arnold, with wife and daughter; shall probably see more of them.\r\n\r\nTO R. W. CHURCH.\r\n\r\nNovember 12, 1883.\r\n\r\n... I have just seen the first proof of the portion of “Flora of North\r\nAmerica” that I have been moiling over for so long; and over them and\r\nthe ever-renewed touches to the ever-growing Compositæ, I may expect a\r\ntoilsome winter. That done, I hope about the time that the clear and\r\nbiting, but rather enjoyable, winter subsides into the inclemencies of\r\nour early spring, we hope, if we live and thrive, to take a holiday.\r\nJust how and where is not yet clear, but I hope to have something to say\r\nof it before I am done with this letter. Meanwhile I am curious to know\r\nif you have disposed of Bacon. If your essay pleases me as much as your\r\nremarks in your letter to me, I shall enjoy it. I recant all I wrote you\r\nlong ago, begging you would drop him and take up a more congenial\r\nsubject....\r\n\r\nI am just back this evening from hearing Matthew Arnold read some of his\r\npoems to a great hallful of undergraduates and others, in place of a\r\nlecture which he was to give, but, poor man! was prevented by his agent,\r\nwho seems to be rather his master. He was well received; but one cannot\r\nsay that he is a very graceful or a good reader to an audience of eight\r\nhundred or a thousand people.\r\n\r\nHe tells me you offered him an introduction to me, which he thought he\r\nhardly needed, as we had met him and Mrs. Arnold at a lunch given by\r\nMiss North. We are sorry to hear of the determining reason of his visit\r\nand lecturing tour.... He will succeed in this, no doubt; but it is a\r\nsort of dog’s life, this lecturing all over the country, four times a\r\nweek, at the beck of an agent, who controls all his movements, often to\r\naudiences that will not appreciate him, the more as what he tells me is\r\ntrue, that he has no gift as a speaker. But he is pleasant, and will be\r\nmost kindly received.\r\n\r\nYour Lord Chief Justice was most kindly cared for and made a most\r\npleasant impression. But in Boston, besides coming when every one was\r\naway who should have attended to him, he fell, unwisely, into the hands\r\nof ... Governor Butler, and saw a side of American life and manners\r\nwhich may be well enough for him to see, though we should desire the\r\ncontrary, and will add to his rich repertory of stories, which they say\r\nhe can tell so well. The day he was shown over our university he called\r\nhere, and took a cup of tea with us. He had recently been visiting our\r\ngood friend Lord Justice Fry at Failand, and spoke of Lord Blachford as\r\nhis friend and neighbor....\r\n\r\nMarch 31, 1884.\r\n\r\n... I have, moreover, another reason for sending you this line, to thank\r\nyou for the proof-sheets of the “Bacon.” I read it at a sitting, one day\r\nwhen I was too ill for my daily task. I enjoyed the book greatly, all\r\nthe more, probably, from my freshness, not having read anything upon the\r\nsubject that I now recall since Macaulay’s essay, ages ago. It is like\r\nreading a tragedy.\r\n\r\nWhat a great failure Bacon was, whenever he was tried! Poor Essex,\r\nhunted to death merely for “getting up a row,” and Bacon sacrificing him\r\nwithout compunction, and without seeing that he was probably made a tool\r\nof, merely to serve his personal advantage! Then the poetical justice,\r\nas they call it,--very prosaic justice,--of his own destruction, by a\r\nbolt out of a clear sky, which an enemy was adroit enough to direct to\r\nhis ruin. And poor Bacon with conscience enough to feel that he deserved\r\nit, but not spirit enough to make a fight. No, if Pope’s fling was\r\nundeserved, as you say, it was because of the mean and ignoble set\r\naround him.\r\n\r\nAlmost as pitiable and tragic in its way, pitiable in its true sense,\r\nwas the upshot of Bacon’s higher and nobler life, conceiving vaguely and\r\nlaboring all his days over that which he was unable and incompetent to\r\nbring to the birth. His memory reaping a great reward of fame for a\r\ncentury or so, and then the conclusion reluctantly reached that nothing\r\ntangible in the advancement of Natural Science can be attributed to him.\r\nAltogether, what a solemn sermon! It might be preached from the pulpit\r\nof St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\nWell, I seem to have attempted sermonizing myself, and it is time I\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nWe join in the thanksgivings you are devoutly rendering,[126] and I am\r\nalways,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nAs this is the last letter from Dr. Gray to Dean Church, to be printed,\r\nthe occasion is taken to introduce a letter written by Dean Church to\r\nMrs. Gray some time after the death of his friend, when acknowledging\r\nthe receipt of a copy of the “Scientific Papers.”\r\n\r\nDEAN CHURCH TO MRS. GRAY.\r\n\r\nI have to thank you for two volumes of most interesting reading. Besides\r\nthe interest of the subject discussed, there is a special _cachet_ in\r\nall Dr. Gray’s papers, great and small, which is his own, and which\r\nseems to me to distinguish him from even his more famous contemporaries.\r\nThere is the scientific spirit in it, but firm, imaginative, fearless,\r\ncautious, with large horizons, and very attentive and careful to\r\nobjections and qualifications; and there is besides, what is so often\r\nwanting in scientific writing, the human spirit, always remembering\r\nthat, besides facts and laws, however wonderful or minute, there are\r\nsouls and characters over against them, of as great account as they, in\r\nwhose mirrors they are reflected, whom they excite and delight, and\r\nwithout whose interest they would be blanks. This combination comes out\r\nin his great generalizations, in the bold and yet considerate way in\r\nwhich he deals with Darwin’s ideas, and in the notices of so many of his\r\nscientific friends, whom we feel that he was interested in as men, and\r\nnot only as scientific inquirers. The sweetness and charity, which we\r\nremember so well in living converse, is always on the lookout for some\r\npleasant feature in the people of whom he writes, and to give kindliness\r\nand equity to his judgment.\r\n\r\nAnd what a life of labors it was! I am perfectly aghast at the amount of\r\ngrinding work of which these papers are the indirect evidence....\r\n\r\nFor they [his religious views] were a most characteristic part of the\r\nman, and the seriousness and earnest conviction with which he let them\r\nbe known had, I am convinced, a most wholesome effect on the development\r\nof the great scientific theory in which he was so much interested. It\r\ntook off a great deal of the theological edge, which was its danger,\r\nboth to those who upheld and those who opposed it. I am sure things\r\nwould have gone more crossly and unreasonably, if his combination of\r\nfearless religion and clearness of mind, and wise love of truth, had not\r\ntold on the controversy.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 9, 1884.\r\n\r\nYour last is of May 24th from the Camp, and gives us on the whole better\r\naccounts of your invalids. Bentham at Boultibrooke! I wonder if he would\r\ncare to have letters from me, or from Mrs. Gray, to whom he wrote a\r\ntreasure of a note on the New Year. We had an idea it might only worry\r\nhim....\r\n\r\nI wish we could see you at the Camp and among the heather, and I wish I\r\ncould form a clear conception of just how you are placed, taking the\r\nRotherys’ house as a point of departure.\r\n\r\nWe give you up as to America this year. I would not have you and Lady\r\nHooker just run over here for a call; it would be too provoking. Well,\r\nlet us plan for January or February next, and Mexico, Arizona, and\r\nsouthern California.\r\n\r\n“Man never is, but always to be blest.”\r\n\r\nThe Joad herbarium was a real bonanza....\r\n\r\nI must tell of our two weeks’ run, Mrs. Gray and I. We left the too\r\ntardy spring here, one evening; were the next noon in Washington, where\r\nthe spring was in full force and beauty. After two days, left Washington\r\none morning, followed up the Potomac River to its very rise in the\r\nAlleghanies, and down on to Mississippi waters before dark; woke near\r\nCincinnati, had a pleasant day’s journey to St. Louis, which we reached\r\nbefore sunset. There had five days, rather busy ones; thence a journey\r\nof thirty-six hours, over prairies of Illinois and Indiana to Buffalo,\r\nand to New York city; there two days, and then home.[127] Mrs. Gray,\r\nthus away from household cares and a rough air, dropped her cough\r\naltogether; and what you would think a tiresome piece of journeying\r\nbrought us both home much refreshed....\r\n\r\nYou remember Henry Shaw, his park and Missouri botanic garden. The old\r\nfellow is now eighty-four. Something induced him to ask my advice, and\r\nto let me know the very ample fortune with which he is to endow the\r\ngarden, when he dies. I was in doubt whether all this was likely to be\r\nquite wasted, or was in condition to be turned to good account for\r\nbotany and horticulture when Mr. Shaw leaves it and his trust comes to\r\nbe executed. I wished also to see that dear old Engelmann’s herbarium\r\nshould be properly and permanently preserved. So I went on to St. Louis.\r\nMr. Shaw took me into his counsel and, without going here into details,\r\nwithout seeing a chance for doing much while Mr. Shaw lives, which\r\ncannot be very long, I see there is a grand opportunity coming, and I\r\nthink that none of the provisions he has made will hinder the right\r\ndevelopment of the Mississippian Kew, which will hardly be “Kew in a\r\ncorner.” And if he follows my advice and mends some matters, there will\r\nbe a grand foundation laid.\r\n\r\nWe are expecting Ball toward the end of the month. He will have time to\r\ntravel and botanize before the Montreal meeting. But I can’t go with\r\nhim, nor, perhaps, could I much help him....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray’s friend of many years, George Engelmann, M. D., died in\r\nFebruary, 1884. He was a student at Heidelberg with Schimper and\r\nAlexander Braun in 1827, and again in Paris, in 1832, with Agassiz and\r\nBraun. He came to America in 1834, made some journeys on horseback in\r\nthe West, and settled as a physician in St. Louis, then a frontier\r\ntrading-post, in 1835. He lived to see it become a metropolis of over\r\nfour hundred thousand inhabitants. Dr. Gray says in his memoirs of him,\r\n“In the consideration of Dr. Engelmann’s botanical work it should be\r\nremembered that his life was that of an eminent and trusted physician;\r\n... that he devoted only the residual hours, which most men use for rest\r\nor recreation, to scientific pursuits.... Nothing escaped his attention;\r\nhe drew with facility; and he methodically secured his observations by\r\nnotes and sketches. The lasting impression which he has made upon North\r\nAmerican botany is due to his habit of studying his subjects in their\r\nsystematic relations, and devoting himself to a particular genus of\r\nplants until he had elucidated it as completely as lay within his power.\r\nIn this way all his work was made to tell effectively.... It shows how\r\nmuch may be done for science in a busy physician’s horæ subsecivæ, and\r\nin his occasional vacations. Personally he was one of the most affable\r\nand kindly of men, and was as much beloved as respected by those who\r\nknew him.”\r\n\r\nTO SIR EDWARD FRY.\r\n\r\nOctober 10, 1884.\r\n\r\nIt is quite time that I responded to your kind and welcome letters.\r\nFirst, let me congratulate myself upon having you as a colleague in the\r\nRoyal Society, in which I think you need not owe your fellowship to\r\nofficial dignity. I believe you took honors in science at the\r\nuniversity, along with our friend Professor Flower.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned your approaching visit, with Lady Fry, to Lord\r\nColeridge.... Lord C., referring to your visit, sent us very cordial\r\nmessages in a letter to my colleague Professor Thayer. He will know that\r\nhis host in Boston, General Butler, is one of the candidates for the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nI am, as you may suppose, a bolter from the Republican presidential\r\nnomination. We even hope to give the electoral vote of Massachusetts,\r\nstanchest of Republican States, to the Democratic candidate. But I need\r\nnot bore you with American politics.\r\n\r\nLet me say how sorry we were not to see Miss Fox at our home. It might\r\nhave been, except for a little journey we made from Philadelphia, of\r\nwhich I must tell you more.\r\n\r\nI had a mere glimpse of Miss Fox at Montreal, and a little more of her\r\ncousin. She came late to Philadelphia, where Mrs. Gray (who was not at\r\nMontreal) and I had a most pleasant chat with her at a garden reception.\r\nThe next day I went out to the suburban place where she was visiting,\r\nand came near to winning her for our expedition, at least as far as to\r\nLuray cave, and the Natural Bridge in the Valley of Virginia. But the\r\nengagements she had made could not be reconciled. Her hostess was to\r\ntake her to this neighborhood, but too early for us to receive her here.\r\nAll good people in this country think so much of Caroline Fox that they\r\nwished to know her sister.\r\n\r\nI have not seen the book by Mr. Arthur on difference between physical\r\nand moral laws, and am not sure that I ever heard of it or of the\r\nauthor. Who is the publisher? I might find it at the university library.\r\nNo, I never had the fortune to see, much less to know Maurice. Of course\r\nI have always known a good deal about him and of the remarkable\r\ninfluence he exerted, both in person and in his writings, “in which were\r\nsome things hard to understand,” such as his liking for the Athanasian\r\ncreed, but nothing that was not most excellent in spirit.\r\n\r\nOf course I well remember Miss Wedgewood; and we had occasional\r\ncorrespondence up to the time when Darwin died, and she, on the part of\r\nthe family, announced it to me. I am glad to know that she wrote the\r\nsketch of Maurice in the “British Quarterly.”\r\n\r\nAnd now about ourselves. I got the Compositæ off my mind late in the\r\nspring, but not off my hands until sometime in August. At the end of\r\nAugust and of the pleasant part of the summer here (for it was\r\ndelightful in Cambridge, so cool and quiet, and Mrs. Gray away only for\r\nthree weeks with her friends on the coast) I went to the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association at Montreal; enjoyed it much; read a paper,[128] a\r\nsort of address, to the botanists coming over to North America, which\r\nthe Section seemed to like and voted to print in extenso. (I will first\r\nprint it here, and send you a copy. Not that there is much novelty in\r\nit, but it may be readable.) I had to leave the meeting after three or\r\nfour days, and return here; sorry to leave our friend Mr. Walter Browne\r\nill at the hospital with typhoid fever. He and his poor wife received\r\nevery kind attention, but he died in a few days.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed that the British meeting was a distinguished success. It\r\nbrought over a throng of English people, and the American savants (I\r\ncannot abide the word “scientists”) were in good force. We were repaid\r\nby the large attendance of British Association members at Philadelphia,\r\nwhere they contributed to make our meeting large and notable.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the weather was all that could be wished, cooler, I\r\nsuppose, than in England at the time. But that week at Philadelphia was\r\nraging. Mrs. Gray and I were there for the whole week, domiciled with\r\nfriends in the heart of the city,--a city which never cools at night, as\r\nit does hereabouts. I bore the heat well, as my manner is; Mrs. Gray,\r\nfairly, by keeping quiet through the mornings and giving herself rather\r\nto the evening receptions, which were fine and most admirably managed.\r\nIt grew cooler the moment the week was over and the session ended.\r\nBesides, we moved at once into a cooler region. It was arranged that I\r\nshould lead any British botanists that cared to go on an excursion into\r\nthe mountains of Virginia and Carolina. But they were otherways bound,\r\nso that I could take only my friend Mr. John Ball of London, your fellow\r\nF. R. S., taking also another American botanist, with whom we had\r\nvisited these regions more than once before, and, to make it pleasanter,\r\nwe added three ladies, wives and daughters of botanists, Mrs. Gray being\r\none.\r\n\r\nOur first day’s journey was to Luray, in the Valley of Virginia, between\r\nthe Blue Ridge and the proper Alleghanies. The next day we visited the\r\nCavern, which I think is the finest in the world, not forgetting that of\r\nAdelsberg in Styria. It is newly discovered, with wonderful wealth and\r\nbeauty of stalactical formations, and is lighted up for visitors with\r\nelectrical lights in all the larger chambers. That day we went on to the\r\nNatural Bridge, which we had not seen for many years. It was grander\r\nthan I had remembered; indeed, it and the scenery around is worth a\r\nvoyage and a journey to see. Then we went on to our favorite Roan\r\nMountain, on the borders of North Carolina and Tennessee, one of the\r\nhighest in the Atlantic United States, and the finest; the base and\r\nsides richly wooded with large deciduous forest trees in unusual variety\r\neven for this country, the ample grassy top (of several square miles)\r\nfringed with dark firs and spruces, and the open part adorned with\r\nthousands of clumps of Rhododendron Catawbiense, which when there last\r\nbefore, late in June, we saw all loaded with blossoms, while the sides\r\nwere glorious with three species of Azalea, not to speak of many other\r\nbotanical treasures. There, at top and at base, we passed four busy\r\ndays. A narrow-gauge railway recently built, and new to us, reaches to\r\nthe base of the mountain, up the Doe River, through most picturesque\r\nscenery, showing to most advantage in the descent. On our way back we\r\ndiverged to visit some striking rock scenery on the upper Kanawha River,\r\nand thence to a mountain-top lower than Roan, but with the advantage of\r\na charming little lake, with banks all fringed with Rhododendron maximum\r\nand Kalmia, hanging over the water for a rod or two, except on the side\r\nwhere the little hotel stands. Well, I have written a deal here, little\r\nas I have managed to tell you. I think you and Lady Fry should come over\r\nand see for yourselves, just a pleasant summer vacation, if you can\r\nleave Failand for so long.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nSeptember 26, 1884.\r\n\r\nSo dear Bentham has gone,--not quite filled out his eighty-fourth year.\r\nWell, we could have wished this year of infirmity and suffering had been\r\navoided. One would like to say good-evening promptly at the close of the\r\nworking-day. But this we cannot order, so we must accept what comes. We\r\nshall miss him greatly. We have nobody left to look up to. He seems to\r\nhave made a wise and good disposition of his effects.\r\n\r\nYour two letters reached us at Philadelphia, on our return from North\r\nCarolina and Virginia....\r\n\r\nYesterday we had Sir William and Lady Thomson.[129] To-day Traill and\r\nwife (young and bright) of Aberdeen looked in and lunched.\r\n\r\nI come home to a heap of letters and parcels and affairs, to keep me\r\nbusy awhile....\r\n\r\nWell, the meeting at Montreal was a success, and made a pleasant\r\noccasion. The influx of visitors from British Association to\r\nPhiladelphia made that meeting very good too. George Darwin I just saw\r\nfor a moment at Montreal, and Mrs. Darwin also at Philadelphia, one\r\nevening,--handsome and winning.\r\n\r\nI hope you have got the copy of “Synoptical Flora II.” for your own\r\nshelf, through Wesley. Slips and omissions are already revealing,\r\nespecially in the index.\r\n\r\nI am wonderfully strong and well. Mrs. G. well up to average, both much\r\nset up by holiday, of which mine has now lasted a month....\r\n\r\nWhat a deal you have fished out of Bentham’s earlier life! I thought you\r\nmeant Toulouse, not Tours. Bentham used to speak of Toulouse and that\r\npart of France....\r\n\r\nAmong the inventive feats of his father was one I have somewhere heard\r\nor read of, that he made a fleet of articulated transport boats for\r\ndescending the crooked channels of the Russian rivers.\r\n\r\nI think you might have specified De Morgan’s discovery of Bentham’s\r\ncontribution to logic, and his able defense of the reclamation, to which\r\nHerbert Spencer’s “Verdict” in 1873 was not particularly needed for the\r\nestablishment of the fact. De Morgan was not a man to leave his work\r\nhalf done, especially as against Hamilton.\r\n\r\nI only regret that the length to which these most interesting matters\r\nextended stood in the way of your giving a more detailed account of\r\nBentham’s botanical work, on which another article would be timely.\r\n\r\nI must now, before long, attempt something of this, for the American\r\nAcademy’s éloge. And I pray you, if you are not doing it yourself, to\r\nsend me hints and suggestions. Sheet full, and I will not begin another\r\nto-day, but add only my wife’s love to you and Lady Hooker.\r\n\r\nJanuary 9, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe souvenir of dear Bentham has come to hand, is in its place on my\r\ntable, and the first use I make of it, now in position, is to write to\r\nyou this letter of thanks,--to you for awarding it to me, and to dear\r\nLady Hooker for so promptly forwarding it. The stand is a beautiful\r\npiece of marble, bearing its two inkstands.[130] Was there ever anything\r\nto occupy the sunken area between them?...\r\n\r\nOf myself I have not much to write. The prospect of getting off for the\r\nlatter part of winter has just prevented my settling down to the\r\n“Flora,” and I have found plenty else to keep me actively employed,\r\nmainly with a revision of some boraginaceous genera, now in printer’s\r\nhands, which I hope, while it unsettles old work, will settle it better\r\nand permanently, as far as anything we do can be said to be lasting.\r\n\r\nI am well,--can hardly be said to need the holiday we have determined\r\non.... We shall benefit much, I think probable, by getting off to meet\r\nthe spring, avoiding February-April here, which are the only drawbacks\r\nto a climate of the best: for you know I do not at all dislike summer\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nWe have not troubled ourselves much as to where we would go. But now it\r\ndoes seem that we will go to the southern part of California, if\r\npossible by the southern Arizona route, which is near the Mexican\r\nboundary, and must be best for winter, and to return by the route\r\nthrough the northern part of Arizona, which should be pleasant in the\r\nlatter part of April. Oh, that you and Lady Hooker could be with us....\r\nAnd we shall be lonely without you on our travels, and feel that “that\r\ngreat principle of the survival of the fittest” has been woefully\r\nviolated....\r\n\r\nCITY OF MEXICO, Sunday, February 22, 1885.\r\n\r\nYour letter of January 20, forwarded from Cambridge, overtook us at San\r\nAntonio, Bexar. We left home February 3, in bitter cold, for St. Louis,\r\nwhere I had an interview with old Shaw, and heard him read his\r\nrearranged will, which is satisfactory, as it will allow his trustees,\r\nand the corporation of Washington University there, to turn his bequests\r\nto good account for botany; will be an endowment quite large enough for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nThence, rail--two nights and a day--to Mobile, where it was warm and\r\nspringlike, but no flowers out, barring an early violet. Thence to New\r\nOrleans, which has a great exposition and a crowd, and where, in a\r\nsudden change to cold, I caught a dreadful cold. It began with such a\r\nhoarseness that, going, Mrs. G. and I, to dine with Dr. Richardson\r\n(son-in-law of Short), where we met your and Dyer’s friends, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Morris[131] of Jamaica, I was taken speechless. I was only for a\r\nfew hours at the Exposition (I hate such), but Mrs. Gray went a second\r\ntime to see Mexican things. Dr. Farlow, joining us at New Orleans,\r\nbrought, to our surprise, passes for us to go by the Mexican Central\r\nRoad to the city of Mexico and back to El Paso (the junction with the\r\nroad to California), and we decided to undertake it. One day and a night\r\ntook us to San Antonio, Texas, where we stayed Saturday, Sunday, and\r\nMonday, till evening, trying to recover from our colds, driving over the\r\ncountry through chaparral of mesquite bushes (Prosopis) and opuntias.\r\nWhen we awoke next morning we were coursing along the rocky banks of the\r\nRio Grande del Norte, mounting into a high region more arid still, if\r\npossible, the only flowers out a Vesicaria; and descending into a great\r\ncattle ranch region we reached El Paso at 3.30 A.M.; got to bed again;\r\nhad the day there and on the other side of the river, at El Paso del\r\nNorte, in the Mexican State of Chihuahua, whence at evening we took our\r\nPullman for three nights and two days’ journey to this place, through\r\nChihuahua, Zacatecas, Aguas-Caliente, Leon, etc., reaching here\r\nyesterday morning at 8.30. We are comfortably placed in the Hotel\r\nIturbide. Farlow and I have looked about somewhat, though I am still\r\nsuffering from catarrh and cough; Mrs. Gray laid up with hers. This\r\nafternoon a Mexican gentleman to whom we took letters called and drove\r\nFarlow and me out to Chapultepec, whence a most magnificent view of the\r\nwhole Valley of Mexico and the surrounding mountains, including\r\nPopocatapetl and its more broadly snowy companion,--with its more\r\ndifficult name, meaning White Lady,--at this season always with\r\ncloudless tops. The cypresses of Chapultepec are glorious trees, plenty\r\nof them, full of character, and of a port which should help to\r\ndistinguish the Mexican species from the North American. I wish you\r\ncould see them. And such old trees of Schinus molle, the handsomest of\r\ntrees either old or young, the old trunks wonderfully bossed. Is it a\r\nnative of Mexico? I thought only of Chili. But it is well at home here.\r\n\r\nSuch yucca trees as we have seen on the way here, with trunks at base\r\ntwo or three feet in diameter, weirdly branched, looking like doum\r\npalms. Opuntias of two or three arborescent species, some huge, and\r\nother cacti not a few.\r\n\r\nI have still to compare Arizona with the plateau of northern Mexico. But\r\nI see they are all pretty much one thing....\r\n\r\nORIZABA, February 27, 1885.\r\n\r\nSince my former sheet, Farlow and I have been mousing about the city of\r\nMexico, I coughing most of the time, in a clear, dry air and nearly\r\ncloudless sky, weather which should be most delightful, but somehow it\r\nis bad for the throat (for the natives as well as for us), and the\r\nrarefied air puts one out of breath at a little exertion; mornings and\r\nevenings cool and fresh, the midday warm, in the sun trying.... Called\r\nin a physician, a sort of medical man to American embassy, who came here\r\nwith Maximilian, and stayed. Very intelligent. Ordered us to come here\r\nas soon as Mrs. Gray could travel. Here only 4,028 feet and a warmer\r\ndamp air. Well, we tried it yesterday; had to leave city of Mexico at\r\n6.15 A.M., our hotel at 5.30 cold, no breakfast; had to travel till ten\r\nor nearly before we could get even a decent cup of coffee, at junction\r\nof road to Vera Cruz and Puebla, and after rising to 8,333 feet in\r\ngetting out of the Valley of Mexico; but at 1 P.M., at Esperanza, in the\r\nTierra Frias, had a capital dinner, and met train from Vera Cruz. Here\r\npine-trees on the hills all round us, two species. Soon begins the\r\ndescent and a complete change of air, the other side all dry and horrid\r\ndust, making our catarrh worse than ever; now the moisture from the Gulf\r\nof Mexico makes all green; the road by skillful engineering pitches down\r\n4,000 feet to this, the greater part of the descent all in eight or nine\r\nmiles of straight line as the bird flies. In all the Valley of Mexico\r\nand to the north of it really nothing in blossom yet, all so dry, except\r\nSenecio salignus, if I rightly remember the name, a shrub of 1-4 feet,\r\njust becoming golden with blossoms. But the moment we began the descent\r\nall was flowery, two species of Baccharis, Eupatoria, Erigeron\r\nmucronatum (so much cultivated under the false name of Vittadenia\r\ntriloba), Lœseliæ species, Arbutus, (Xalapensis) in bud, and many\r\nthings of which we shall know more when we return over the route....\r\nVery comfortable hotel here. Botteri[132] left an élêve here who knows\r\nsomething of botany, but lives out of reach on a hacienda. We found a\r\ngarden combined with a small coffee plantation. The proprietor thereof,\r\nspeaking a little French, has filled his ground with a lot of things\r\nthat will stand here. It is just in _medias res_, two hours below Tierra\r\nFrias, two above (or at Cordoba, only seventeen miles, but 2,000 feet\r\nlower) true tropical. Papaya fruits here, also Persea gratissima, etc.\r\nAnd the oranges are delicious. I have passed the whole morning with the\r\ngarden man, while Farlow went up a small steep mountain, and brought\r\nback various things. We shall drive this afternoon to the Cascade of\r\nRincon Grande (cascades are most rare in Mexico).\r\n\r\nThe air here suits us; shall try to leave our coughs here and at Cordoba\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nOn the way here had views of Popocatapetl and the more beautiful and\r\ndiversified Iztaccihuatl from the sides, and wound round the base of Mt.\r\nOrizaba. A true Mexican town this. Mrs. Gray enjoying sights from the\r\nwindow; will be able to drive out this afternoon, though the clouds are\r\nsinking too much and mist gathering, a great contrast to the city of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nP. M.--We went, but saw the falls (very picturesque) in a wet mist, and\r\nfor botany got a lot of subtropical Mexican plants, the like of which I\r\nnever saw growing before: among Compositæ, Lagascea (large heads), Tree\r\nVernonias of the Scorpioides set, Calea, Andromachia, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nCORDOBA, March 2, 1885.\r\n\r\n... To continue. On Saturday, a fine and sunny morning, Farlow and I\r\ndrove off for the Cascade of Barrio Nuevo, almost as beautiful as the\r\nother, and had a long morning in clambering and collecting. In the\r\ngrounds on the way are planted trees of a Bombacea, in flower before the\r\nleaf, probably Pachira. The peak of Orizaba shows as a narrow streak of\r\nwhite over a near mountain, from the windows of our room; but by going\r\nhalf a mile east the whole comes out splendidly.\r\n\r\nSunday morning we were comparatively quiet, but at 3.50 P.M. we were off\r\nfor Cordoba, less than an hour distant by rail, and 2,000 feet lower. A\r\nqueer little town, with only a poor, truly Mexican inn, a set of rooms\r\nin the single story, all round a patio, into which the country diligence\r\ndrives, and on rear side the stables back against the rooms, as Farlow\r\nfound to his discomfort, only a thin wall between his room and the\r\nhorse’s mangers. Tile floors, cot-beds, but clean, and the food\r\ncertainly better than was to be expected.\r\n\r\nFine view of Orizaba. An American, Dr. Russell, here, whom I looked up.\r\nAnd he took us to an American German, Mr. Fink, who collects Orchids,\r\netc., commercially. He took us to a garden, and we were going to the\r\nriver bank and ravine, but, though out of season, rain set in, and we\r\ncame home rather wet.\r\n\r\nI fear our afternoon excursion may be lost, but it now looks like\r\nclearing. The way from Orizaba here is magnificent, for mountains,\r\nrailroad-engineering, and culture vegetation. I hope we can get into\r\nsome wild tropical vegetation, but uncertain; can stay here only\r\nto-morrow at most. We are cut off from news of all the world; little\r\ncould we get in Mexico city; less since....\r\n\r\nYou would be amused, as I have known you to be in Italy, at my knack of\r\nexplaining myself by gesture, and so getting on....\r\n\r\nLATHROP, CALIFORNIA, May 1, 1885.\r\n\r\nWe have only this morning left Rancho Chico and have set our faces\r\neastward. Waiting for our train I improve the rare bit of leisure to\r\nwrite a line.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we are both well. No cough, however obstinate, could abide\r\nthis charming climate. And having no excuse for further stay we enter\r\nupon the “beginning of the end” of a holiday which now only lacks ten\r\ndays of three months. What a pity to turn our backs on all the fruits we\r\nsee growing around us, having enjoyed only the cherries, which are just\r\ncoming in. Well, we have a basket of them, as big as plums, and so good!\r\nto solace the first days of the desert part of our journey. We shall\r\nhave desert enough on the way home, as we cross Arizona and New Mexico\r\nby the Atlantic and Pacific railway, through the northern part of those\r\nTerritories (having come out by the southern), a country quite new to\r\nus. How often we have wished for you and Lady Hooker!\r\n\r\nWhen and whence did I write you last? I think from Los Angeles and\r\nbefore our trip to San Diego.\r\n\r\nInstead of a short journey by sea (which my wife detests) we made a long\r\ncircumbendibus by rail to the southernmost town in California; declined\r\nan invitation to go over the border into Mexican California; was, in\r\nfact, too unwell to do anything in the field, and so, finding the coast\r\ntoo cool and damp, returned, stopping two nights with Parish and wife,\r\nat their little ranch at San Bernardino, in a dry and warm region, a\r\ncharming valley girt with high mountains, on the eastern side still\r\nsnow-topped,--indeed they are so most of the summer. Back thence to Los\r\nAngeles we soon went, down to the port San Pedro, and took steamer for\r\nSanta Barbara, the very paradise of California in the eyes of its\r\ninhabitants, and indeed of most others. Our cruise of only eight hours\r\non the Pacific was pleasant, and most of it in daylight.\r\n\r\nArriving after dark, we found, to our surprise, the mayor of the little\r\ntown on the wharf with a carriage for our party (wife, Farlow, and\r\nself), who drove us to the fine watering-place kind of hotel, and on\r\nbeing shown at once to our rooms we found them all alight and embowered\r\nin roses, in variety and superbness such as you never saw the beat of,\r\nnot to speak of Bougainvilleas, Tacsonias, and passion-flowers,\r\nCape-bulbs in variety, etc., etc., and a full assortment of the wild\r\nflowers of the season. Mrs. Gray was fairly taken off her feet. During\r\nthe ten or eleven days we stayed, there were few in which we were not\r\ntaken on drives, the most pleasant and various. The views, even from our\r\nwindows, of sea and mountain and green hills (for California is now\r\nverdant, except where Eschscholtzia and Bahias and Layia, etc., and\r\nLupines turn it golden or blue) were just enchanting; and on leaving we\r\nwere by good management allowed to pay our hotel bill.... Had you been\r\nof the party I believe the good people would have come out with oxen and\r\ngarlands, and would hardly have been restrained.\r\n\r\nHere we were driven out fifteen miles to one of the great ranches,--a\r\nvisit of two nights and a day,--that of Mr. Cooper, a very refined\r\nfamily; the whole ranch flanked on the windward sides by eucalyptus\r\ngroves, apricots, almond, peach-trees, etc., by the dozens of acres; but\r\nthe produce on which the enthusiastic owner has set his heart is that of\r\nthe olive, and he makes the best of olive oil, and in a large way.\r\nHollister’s ranch is still larger, miles long every way; both reach from\r\nmountain-top to sea, and have fine drives up cañons, in these fine oaks\r\nand plane-trees, occasionally an Acer macrophyllum and an Alder.\r\nAvoiding the sea, which gives a short route, we reached San Francisco by\r\na lovely drive, in a hired wagon, over a pass in the Santa Inez\r\nMountains to the coast (south) at Ventura, and so up the broad and long\r\nSanta Clara Valley to Newhall, on the Southern Pacific railway, not very\r\nfar above Los Angeles (two days’ drive, most pleasant), then by rail\r\novernight and to this place to breakfast, and on to San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWe stopped this time at the Lick House, where we had, European-wise, a\r\nroom, not quite so good as we had at the Palace Hotel eight years ago,\r\nand fed at the restaurant, very nice and reasonable, when we were not\r\nvisiting or invited out, which was most of the time. So it was not\r\nexpensive, our room (parlor, bedroom shutting off, and a bathroom)\r\ncosting only about 12 shillings for us both. Harkness looks the same,\r\nbut older; is absorbed in fungology. Here again we were made much of for\r\ntwelve days, most busy ones. General McDowell, who you remember dined us\r\nat the “Palace,” is ill; we saw him twice, and he has since so failed\r\nthat we daily expect to hear of the end.\r\n\r\nMay 4. In Farlie’s Chalet hotel in the Grand Cañon of the Colorado.\r\n\r\nDr. Brigham, you remember, who took us to the Chinese theatre, is now\r\nmarried, and has three children by a bright wife, with a rich father,\r\nand a handsome house, above Presidio,--a fine site, and filled with fine\r\nthings from all countries, and such a rose-garden; gave us a handsome\r\ndinner. Alvord and wife (president now of Bank of California), noble\r\npeople, did wonders for us, and a dinner and drives. A lunch over at the\r\nuniversity; and another by General (commanding the Western Department\r\nin place of McDowell, and in the choice house the latter built) and Mrs.\r\nPope (she an old acquaintance); then we went over to San Rafael, a night\r\nwith the Barbers, and next day a drive up behind Mount Tamalpais to the\r\ncañon reservoir of water-works, and saw, at length (having failed on all\r\nformer visits), that huge Madroña (Arbutus Menziesii), like one of those\r\ngreat and wide-spreading oaks you used to admire. Next day to Monterey,\r\nwhich we saw nothing of on that hurried visit eight years ago, when our\r\nsingle day was sacrificed to Hayden’s insane desire to see a coal mine\r\non a bare hill! Now there are eighteen miles of good drive around all\r\nPoint Pinos and through it, and Cupressus macrocarpa on the seaside\r\nverge, noble and picturesque old trees, and no lack of young ones, a\r\nlittle back, and grand sea and shore views.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the town, in a grove of great live oaks and Pinus\r\ninsignis mixed, made into a beautiful park and park gardens, with a\r\nseparate railway station in the grounds, is the crack hotel of the\r\nWestern coast, the work of the Pacific Railway Company, which has also\r\nbought and appended the whole of the pine grove, five or six miles long\r\nand two or three wide, thus preserving Pinus insignis and the cypress,\r\nthe latter much needing it.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Alvord, knowing our visit was to be, had telegraphed for\r\nbest rooms, and joined us unexpectedly; took us on the long drive the\r\nnext day, with four fine horses.... They showed us no end of kind\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAt length we got off for a visit to Chico (leaving Farlow to apologize\r\nat Santa Cruz, etc.), a quicker way than before, a steam-ferry across\r\nSuisin Bay helping. And there we had a nice time indeed, from Saturday\r\nevening to Friday morning, every day, drives and picnics, and\r\nbotanizing, and feeding on (besides strawberries) such cherries, just\r\ncoming in in acres of cherry-orchards, the only fruits yet in season.\r\nThat big fig-tree, in the branches of which I used to hide and feast, or\r\nrather cram, is bigger than ever, but the figs green, to my sorrow. And\r\nwe cannot wait for them. General Bidwell[133] and wife have aged little\r\nin the eight years, are as good as ever, full of all noble and good\r\nworks, as well as of generous hospitality; have taken wonderfully to\r\nbotany; remember you most affectionately and long for a real visit. His\r\ngreat ambition is to make drives, good roads, through the ranch, for\r\npleasure as well as use; he has now over a hundred miles of them. That\r\nbig oak[134] is finer than ever; not a dead branch.\r\n\r\nWell, off at length; at Lathrop joined our eastward train at evening; up\r\nthe San Joaquin valley all night, and had early morning for the\r\nwonderful Tahachapi Pass. Breakfast at Mohave. (I must send you a\r\nrailroad map.) There took the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad, over the\r\nsandy desert to the Great Colorado at supper, to Peach Spring station at\r\ntwo A.M., and next morning in an easy “buckboard wagon” twenty-two miles\r\nand 4,000 feet descent into this wonderful cañon, a piece of it, which\r\nits explorer, Major Powell, has made famous.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon and evening we are to get up and back, and on in the\r\nnight and morning to Flagstaff, and the ancient cliff dwellings.\r\n\r\nIN THE CARS, KANSAS CITY, May 8, 1885.\r\n\r\nLet me finish up these mems. We have now only a run of eleven hours to\r\nSt. Louis, where we stay three or four days with Dr. Engelmann (Jr.),\r\nand then home.\r\n\r\nThe cañon trip well repaid the journey and its rough accessories. Some\r\nof the views are of those depicted by Powell. We find that Tylor and\r\nMoseley were here last year. As the man whom we had introductions to at\r\nFlagstaff was absent for a day or two, though we found he had left\r\nsubstitutes, and as we wanted to get home as soon as we could, we gave\r\nup the visit to the cave and cliff dwellings. I dare say the models in\r\nclay, made at Washington, are as good as the originals. So we came on,\r\none and a half nights and two days, and to-night we shall sleep in beds\r\nat St. Louis. We bear this sort of travel quite well. From Mohave to the\r\nColorado is very sandy and complete desert, descending eastward many\r\nhundred feet. Near Mohave lots of tree yuccas, looking very like those\r\nin northern part of Mexico. From the Colorado to Peach Spring we passed\r\nin the dark, but had risen to about 6,000 feet, and we kept on an\r\nelevation of 4,000 to nearly 8,000 feet all across the rest of Arizona\r\nand New Mexico, the higher parts wooded with conifers, that is, Pinus\r\nponderosa of the Rocky Mountains form and Juniperus. At Las Vegas, New\r\nMexico, we laid over one train, to rest and visit the Hot Springs; no\r\ngreat to see, except a spick and span new hotel, too fine for the place,\r\nand some very hot water.\r\n\r\nWell, this trip, which will nearly round out to three and a half months,\r\nhas been long and enjoyable indeed.\r\n\r\nAt St. Louis will be letters, perhaps one from you.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nPart of yesterday and last night was down along the Arkansas, the\r\nreverse of our journey eight years ago. Country much settled up.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, August 26, 1885.\r\n\r\n... Charles Wright is dead, at seventy-three and a half; had been\r\nsuffering of heart-disease, went out to his barn, was missed as the\r\nevening drew on, was found dead. So they go, one by one....\r\n\r\nThe summer is almost gone,--one hardly knows how,--but, then, we have a\r\nlonger and finer autumn than you have in England.\r\n\r\nThe five hundred copies which I printed in 1878 are gone. And, as I have\r\nto print new copies, I take the opportunity to correct on the stereotype\r\nplates when I can,--a great lot of wrong references to volume, page,\r\nplates,--that is, such as we have found out. What a bother they are, and\r\nhow impossible to make correct in the first place, and to keep so\r\nthrough the printer’s hands! Then there are lots of important\r\ncorrections to make, and new species and genera galore.\r\n\r\nSo,--in an evil moment, you will say--I set about a supplement to this\r\nnew issue,--also of the other part. For, as I have now brought out in\r\nthe two parts all the Gamopetalæ, and as I begin to doubt if I shall\r\nhold out to accomplish much more, I thought it best to leave behind at\r\nleast these in good state. But it is no small job. And this, with the\r\ngreat amount of herbarium work that goes along with it, or beside it,\r\njust uses up the summer; for I dare guess it will keep me occupied all\r\nSeptember....\r\n\r\nThe last news of you is a letter from your dear wife to mine,--giving\r\nsuch a pleasant picture of the two boys, and of your enjoyment of them.\r\nYou say you are quite well, and Lady Hooker much the same,--which is\r\ncomforting. But you are naturally growing older, like myself. I tire\r\nsooner than I used to do, and have not so sure a touch nor so good a\r\nmemory. The daily grind we both find more wearing....\r\n\r\nWe should like to come over to you once more,--but it seems less and\r\nless practicable; unless I become actually unfit for work, and then I\r\nshall not be worth seeing....\r\n\r\nYour affectionate old friend,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nOld, indeed; the president of the Naturæ Curiosorum wrote me on August 3\r\nthat I have been one of the _curious_ for fifty years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray wrote a notice of Charles Wright for the “American Journal of\r\nScience,” in which he says that “Charles Wright was born at\r\nWethersfield, Connecticut; graduated at Yale in 1835. Had an early love\r\nfor botany, which may have taken him to the South as a teacher in\r\nMississippi, whence he went to Texas, joining the early immigration, and\r\noccupied himself botanizing and surveying, and then again in teaching.\r\nHe accompanied various expeditions, and no name is more largely\r\ncommemorated in the botany of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona than\r\nCharles Wright. It is an acanthaceous genus of this district, of his own\r\ndiscovery, that bears the name of Carlowrightia. Surely no botanist ever\r\nbetter earned such scientific remembrance by entire devotion, acute\r\nobservation, severe exertion, and perseverance under hardship and\r\nprivation.” He was engaged later for several years “in his prolific\r\nexploration of Cuba.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wright was a person of low stature and well-knit frame, hardy\r\nrather than strong, scrupulously temperate, a man of simple ways, always\r\nmodest and unpretending, but direct and downright in expression, most\r\namiable, trusty, and religious. He accomplished a great amount of useful\r\nand excellent work for botany in the pure and simple love of it; and his\r\nmemory is held in honorable and grateful remembrance by his surviving\r\nassociates.”[135]\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. REDFIELD.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, November 3, 1885.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR REDFIELD,--I was interested in your Corema Con.\r\n\r\nI have a remark to make on the last sentence of it; I would ask, How\r\ncould the plant have an introduction following the glacial period? And\r\nwhere could it have come from?\r\n\r\nOf course my idea is that it existed at the higher north before the\r\nglacial period--that is my fad.\r\n\r\nBut one sees that this is one of a few plants that may be appealed to in\r\nbehalf of an Atlantis theory,--as coming across the Atlantic, making\r\nthis Corema a derivation from C. alba, of Portugal, or of _its_\r\nancestor. But the Atlantic is thought to be too deep for an Atlantis;\r\nand we do not need it much.\r\n\r\nWhat induces me to refer to your paragraph is to ask whether your\r\n“following the glacial period,” that is, recent introduction, means in\r\nyour thought that our species is a direct descendant of Corema alba,\r\nwhich by some chance got wafted across the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThat is the most probable notion, next to my theory.\r\n\r\nFor consider, we know the genus only on these two opposite shores.\r\n\r\nPerhaps--so far as I know, there is no more C. alba in the Old World\r\nthan C. Conradii in the New. And if it were in New England that the\r\nformer occurs, we could say that the Old World received the genus from\r\nthe New--via the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nNovember 6.\r\n\r\n... I start farther back than the retreat of the glaciers. I suppose\r\nthat the common ancestor of both Coremas was in the high north before\r\nthe glacial period, and that the two, in their limited but dissociated\r\nhabitats, are what is left after such vicissitudes!\r\n\r\nIn that view it does not matter how long New England coast was under\r\nwater. Our plant and its companions were then further south or west.\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of Dr. Gray’s seventy-fifth birthday it was suggested\r\namong the younger botanists that some tribute of love and respect should\r\nbe presented to him. Accordingly a letter was sent to all botanists\r\nwhose addresses could be obtained within the very limited time. A silver\r\nvase was decided upon, and designs furnished, which were most happily\r\nand beautifully carried out. The description, copied from the “Botanical\r\nGazette,” gives its size and decorations.\r\n\r\n“It is about eleven inches high exclusive of the ebony pedestal, which\r\nis surrounded by a hoop of hammered silver, bearing the inscription\r\n‘1810, November eighteenth, 1885--Asa Gray--in token of the universal\r\nesteem of American Botanists.’\r\n\r\n“The decoration of one side is Graya polygaloides, surrounded by\r\nAquilegia Canadensis, Centaurea Americana, Jeffersonia diphylla,\r\nRudbeckia speciosa, and Mitchella repens. On the other Shortia\r\ngalacifolia, Lilium Grayi, Aster Bigelovii, Solidago serotina, and\r\nEpigæa repens. The lower part of the handles runs into a cluster of\r\nDionæa leaves, which clasps the body of the vase, and their upper parts\r\nare covered with Notholæna Grayi. Adlumia cirrhosa trails over the whole\r\nbackground. The entire surface is oxidized, which gives greater relief\r\nto the decorations.”\r\n\r\nGreetings in the form of cards and letters, sent by those who gave the\r\nvase, were placed on a silver salver accompanying the gift, with the\r\ninscription, “Bearing the greetings of one hundred and eighty botanists\r\nof North America to Asa Gray on his seventy-fifth birthday, November\r\n18th, 1885.”\r\n\r\nDr. Gray was exceedingly touched and delighted, as well as overwhelmed\r\nwith surprise. And the day, with pleasant calls and congratulations from\r\nfriends and neighbors, gifts of flowers with warm and kindly notes, was\r\nmade a memorable one indeed.\r\n\r\nHis response to the senders of the vase was printed and sent to all who\r\ncould be reached.\r\n\r\nHERBARIUM OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY,\r\nCAMBRIDGE, MASS., November 19, 1885.\r\n\r\nHANG\r\n_To J. C. Arthur, C. R. Barnes, J. M. Coulter, Committee, and to the\r\nnumerous Botanical Brotherhood represented by them_:\r\n\r\nAs I am quite unable to convey to you in words any adequate idea of the\r\ngratification I received on the morning of the 18th inst., from the\r\nwealth of congratulations and expressions of esteem and affection,\r\nwhich welcomed my seventy-fifth birthday, I can do no more than render\r\nto each and all my heartiest thanks. Among fellow-botanists, more\r\npleasantly connected than in any other pursuit by mutual giving and\r\nreceiving, some recognition of a rather uncommon anniversary might\r\nnaturally be expected. But this full flow of benediction, from the whole\r\nlength and breadth of the land whose flora is a common study and a\r\ncommon delight, was as unexpected as it is touching and memorable.\r\nEqually so is the exquisite vase which accompanied the messages of\r\ncongratulation and is to commemorate them, and upon which not a few of\r\nthe flowers associated with may name or with my special studies are so\r\ndeftly wrought by art, that of them one may almost say, “The art itself\r\nis nature.”\r\n\r\nThe gift is gratefully received, and it will preserve the memory to\r\nthose who come after us of a day made by you, dear brethren and sisters,\r\na very happy one to\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO S. M. J.\r\n\r\nNovember 19, 1885.\r\n\r\nWe meant our day to have been most quiet, and I completely and J.\r\nlargely were taken by surprise. So we had to send for two or three\r\nneighbors, especially to see the vase.\r\n\r\nJ. will bring it in to you, no doubt, for she is very proud of it. The\r\nlines I have already written have taken all the strength out of my right\r\narm, but not all the love out of my heart, of which a good share is\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nTO W. M. CANBY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, November 19, 1885.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CANBY,--Many thanks for your felicitations. There is much I want\r\nto write, and to say what a surprise we had, and how perfect the vase\r\nis. But my arm is worn out with note-writing.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTwo poems and a poetical epigram came among the rest!\r\n\r\nTO SIR EDWARD FRY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 31, 1886.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I am a laggard correspondent, I fear. Here are your two\r\nmost friendly and interesting letters, as far back as November, one of\r\nwhich crossed, and one which announced, the reception of my long letter\r\nwhich gave a sketch of our journeyings which began almost a year ago.\r\nFor we are now already in the middle of another winter. I doubt if we\r\nshall flee from this one, although it has shown some severity. In the\r\nfirst place, we may thankfully say that neither Mrs. Gray nor I can say\r\nthat we require it; and I cannot bear to lose the time: I seem to need\r\nthe more of this as the stock diminishes; for, somehow, I cannot get as\r\nmuch done in a day as I used to do. Moreover, it is no good running away\r\nfrom winter unless you can go far. For our southern borders have been\r\nunusually wintry, and they want our guards and preparations against\r\ncold.... We were glad enough to get back to our well and equably warmed\r\nhouse, where, indeed, we are most comfortable.\r\n\r\nYou called my attention, I believe, to Professor Allen’s book on the\r\n“Development of Christian Doctrine.” I take shame to myself that I did\r\nnot procure and read it. But I know its lines, and read some part of it\r\nbefore it was in the book, and, of course, I like it much.\r\n\r\nI am going, in a few days, to send you a little book, with similar\r\nbearings, which I read in the articles of which it is made up. I think\r\nyou will find much of it interesting.\r\n\r\nBishop Temple’s “Bampton Lectures” seemed to me very good as far as it\r\nwent, but hardly came up to expectation.\r\n\r\nI saw something of Canon Farrar when here. He pleased well, and I think\r\nwas well pleased; and personally he was very pleasing and lovable.\r\n\r\nI wish more of the English Churchmen would visit us, and give more time\r\nespecially to the study of their own branch of the church in the United\r\nStates,--a very thriving one. I think they might learn much that would\r\nbe helpful and hopeful,--difficult as it may be to apply the experience\r\nand the ways of one country to another.\r\n\r\nI have seen, but not read, Mr. Forbes’s “Travels in Eastern\r\nArchipelago.” Those who have read it here say it is very interesting. We\r\nhave a great lot of his dried plants from Sumatra and Java, unnamed,\r\nwhich at odd hours I am arranging for the herbarium. I hope that in his\r\nnew journey he will manage to make better specimens. But, as he is\r\nprimarily an entomologist, this can hardly be expected. But, if I\r\nrightly understand, he goes out now with a good backing and probably\r\nbetter conveniences for collecting than he could have had before.\r\n\r\nWe have been, and still are, much interested in English politics and\r\nelection excitements. You are having very anxious times, indeed. What a\r\npity that some one party, that is, one of the two great parties, is not\r\nstrong enough, and homogeneous enough, to command the situation for the\r\ntime being, and to deal independently of Parnell, or, indeed, of\r\nChamberlain....\r\n\r\nWe Americans are wonderfully peaceful--our only real questions now\r\npending are financial, and those not yet treated as they ought to be, on\r\nparty lines. We have an awful silver craze; but we hope to arrest it\r\nbefore it comes to the worst, though sense and argument are at present\r\nineffectual.\r\n\r\nWe have a comfortable trust in the principle that “Providence specially\r\nprotects from harm the drunken, the crazy, and the United States of\r\nAmerica.”\r\n\r\nI see our friend Professor Thayer now and then. He is well and\r\nflourishing. Mrs. Gray and I are very well indeed, and we send our most\r\ncordial good wishes to you all.\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 9, 1886.\r\n\r\nWhen I read A. de Candolle’s notice of Boissier, I thought it was\r\n“charming.” Anyhow, it brought back to me the charming memory of a very\r\nlovable man. I dare say neither De Candolle nor I has done justice to\r\nBoissier’s work. I could only touch and go,--make a picture that would\r\njust sketch the kind of man he was.\r\n\r\n... Yes, I have got on Ranunculaceæ, and have done up to and through\r\nRanunculus, minus the Batrachium set, of which happily we have few in\r\nNorth America, that we know of. But having done some while ago the\r\nGamopetalæ of Pringle’s interesting North Mexican collection, I am now\r\nswitched off to the same in a hurried collection made by Dr. Palmer, in\r\nan unvisited part of Chihuahua, in which very much is new. One after\r\nanother those Mocino[136] and Sessé plants turn up. Also those of\r\nWislizenus, whom the Mexicans for a time interned on the flanks of the\r\nSierra Madre.\r\n\r\nWe are bound to know the botany of the parts of Mexico on our frontier,\r\nand so must even do the work. Pringle goes back there directly, with\r\nincreased facilities, and will give special attention to the points of\r\nterritory which I regard as most hopeful.\r\n\r\nTrelease,[137] our most hopeful young botanist,--established at St.\r\nLouis,--is here for a part of the winter, to edit a collection of the\r\nscattered botanical publications of Engelmann which Shaw pays for--or at\r\nleast pays for to a large extent. He would have the plates and figures,\r\nand that will double the cost and the sum Shaw offered to provide. We\r\nmay have to sell some of the edition in order to recoup the charges....\r\n\r\nYes, you hit a blot. I can see to all my own books, such as the\r\n“Synoptical Flora.” But, somehow, I cannot restrain the publishers from\r\naltering the date of their title-pages when they print off a new issue\r\nfrom the stereotype plates....\r\n\r\nWhat do I call an alpine plant? Why, one that has its habitat above the\r\nlimit of trees--mainly--though it may run down lower along streams. But\r\nin a dry region, where forest has no fair chance, we might need to mend\r\nthe definition.\r\n\r\nUpon your paper, I got a few notes--offhand, by references.\r\n\r\nI premise that in New England we have two places where several alpine\r\nplants are stranded at lower levels than they ought, peculiar conditions\r\nof configuration and shelter having preserved them, while the exposed\r\nhigher grounds have lost them. They are Willoughby Mountain and the\r\nNotch of Mt. Mansfield, Vermont.\r\n\r\nAs to your III. Of the whole list of alpine plants of Oregon and\r\nnorthward and not of California, I can put my hand upon only two that\r\nare yet known in California, viz., Armania verna and Vaccinium\r\ncæspitosum, which comes in its var. arbuscula only.\r\n\r\nThere is a great lack of alpine arctic plants in California. First,\r\nbecause there is not much place for them now; secondly, because there\r\nhave been such terrible and vast volcanic deposits--lava and ashes--that\r\nthey must have been all killed out.\r\n\r\nBut for all these matters we shall one of these days have fuller and\r\nsurer data--after my day. Well, I must stop....\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, June 29, 1886.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--Your letter and inclosure of the 15th inst. gave\r\nme much pleasure. Not only had I a natural curiosity to know more of\r\nCoulter,[138] but also I find it important to know his routes in Mexico\r\nand California.\r\n\r\nAt Los Angeles, last year, I fell in with one of the “old settlers” who\r\nknew him, and who accompanied him on that expedition into the Arizona\r\ndesert on the lower Colorado. Mr. Ball will ascertain and let me know\r\nother particulars of the man, and the date of his death, which probably\r\noccurred not long after that last letter to you, from Paris.\r\n\r\nIn various ways I am convinced that I am on the verge of superannuation.\r\nStill I work on; and now, dividing the orders with Mr. Watson (who,\r\nthough not young, is eight or ten years my junior), we are working away\r\nat the Polypetalæ of the “Synoptical Flora of North America,” with\r\nconsiderable heat and hope. But it is slow work!\r\n\r\nTuckerman, our lichenologist, has gone before us! I shall in a few days\r\nsend you a copy of the memorial of him which I contributed to the\r\nCouncil report of the American Academy of Sciences and am having\r\nreprinted in the “American Journal of Science” for July.\r\n\r\nMy wife is fairly well.... She is always busy; and we both enjoy life\r\nwith a zest, being in all respects very happily situated, particularly\r\nin having plenty to do.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that you may still be able to give us better accounts of\r\nMadame de Candolle and of yourself; and believe me to be always,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. DANA.\r\n\r\nBOTANIC GARDEN, CAMBRIDGE, MASS., September 20, 1886.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DANA,--Well! “the books” have just come.\r\n\r\nI suppose you are in no hurry for notices of them, and would prefer\r\nshort ones....\r\n\r\nI rather like to do such things incog., as in the “Nation,” in which I\r\nsometimes take a shot at this or that.\r\n\r\nI and wife are well,--very.\r\n\r\nHad a week in Old Oneida, which still looks natural. I am grinding away\r\nat “Flora,” and probably shall be found so doing when I am called for.\r\n\r\nVery well! I have a most comfortable and happy old age. Wishing you the\r\nsame,\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, September 15, 1886.\r\n\r\n... Has Ball returned to England? If so, please tell him that he\r\npromised to look up in Dublin, and give from his own knowledge, some\r\ndetails of Coulter’s life. Alphonse de Candolle has sent me copies of\r\nwhat letters he has, and they enable me to trace Coulter’s movements and\r\nwhereabouts, which is helpful.\r\n\r\nOld Goldie,[139] your father’s correspondent lang syne, died only this\r\nsummer, very old.\r\n\r\nMy last bit of work was upon our Portulacaceæ for my “Flora.” The genera\r\nare thin. It is as much as one can do to keep up Montia (though if that\r\nfails Claytonia should go to it rather than the contrary, by\r\nright,--but convenience would call for the contrary), also Spraguea.\r\n\r\nI have been having a holiday. A fortnight ago my wife and I set out;\r\nmade a visit to my natal soil, in the centre of the State of New York,\r\nin Oneida County; had a gathering of the surviving members--most of\r\nthem--of the family, of which I am the senior,--two widowed sisters (one\r\na sister-in-law), there resident, and an older one who came with her\r\nhusband from Michigan; my oldest brother and family, who have the\r\npaternal homestead; the unmarried sister, who passes all her winters\r\nwith us; children and some grandchildren. One brother, a lawyer in New\r\nYork, and residing near by in New Jersey, with wife and two boys, did\r\nnot come. Another absent nephew is in California, well settled there.\r\n\r\nIt is a pretty country, the upper valley of the Mohawk and of tributary\r\nstreams from the south, which interlock with tributaries of the\r\nSusquehanna, at a height of 1,000 to 1,500 feet above tide-water,\r\nbeautiful rolling hills and valleys, fertile and well cultivated, more\r\nlike much of rural England than anything else you saw over here. We\r\nwished you and Lady Hooker could have been with us in our drives. The\r\nsummer air is just delightful, soft and fresh.\r\n\r\nOn our return we struck off and visited my brother Joe and family, in\r\nthe environs of New York, and so came home much refreshed--though,\r\nindeed, I hardly felt the need of a holiday.\r\n\r\nSargent has just started for a trip to the southern part of the\r\nmountains of North Carolina,--a region we are fond of and long to show\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nNow I am going to pitch into Malvaceæ. I am quite alone. Goodale took\r\noff Sereno Watson with him, on a slow steamer to Amsterdam; will run for\r\na fortnight or so over nearer parts of the Continent, and Watson will\r\nlook in at Kew. He was much worn down, and the rest and change will be\r\ngood for him. I have filled my sheet with this gossip.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was during this visit that Dr. Gray, when the family gathered one\r\nmorning for breakfast, had disappeared. He came in smiling when the meal\r\nwas half over, and in answer to the anxious question where he had been,\r\nsaid, “Oh, I have been to say to Mrs. Rogers that I forgave her for\r\ngetting above me in the spelling-class.”\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 31, 1886.\r\n\r\nDEAR HOOKER,--Thanks for a nice long letter from Bournemouth, September\r\n27. Thanks, too, for the hope--though rather dim--that you and wife may\r\ncome over to us in the spring. Before winter is over we must arrange\r\nsome programme; for we four must meet again somehow and somewhere, while\r\nin the land of the living. But how is a problem.\r\n\r\n... I see how difficult it must be for you to get away as far as to us.\r\nOur obstacle to any amount of strolling away is mainly the fear that if\r\nI interrupt my steady work on the “Flora of North America,” I may not\r\nget back to it again, or have the present zeal and ability for\r\nprosecuting it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I and my wife do not get some playdays now, while\r\nwe can enjoy them, the time will soon come when we shall have to say\r\nthat we have no pleasure in them. Therefore we are in sore straits....\r\nIf really you cannot come, then we will brave out the winter here, as\r\nwe did last winter and are none the worse; then we will seriously\r\nconsider whether Mahomet shall go to the mountain, which will not come\r\nto Mahomet.\r\n\r\nI grind away at “Flora,” but, like the mills of the gods, I grind\r\nslowly, as becomes my age,--moreover, to continue the likeness, I grind\r\ntoo “exceedingly fine,” being too finical for speed, pottering over so\r\nmany things that need looking into, and which I have not the discretion\r\nto let alone. Consequently the grist of each day’s work is pitiably\r\nsmall in proportion to the labor expended on it. I am now at Malvaceæ,\r\nwhich I once enjoyed setting to rights, and of which the North American\r\nspecies have got badly muddled since I had to do with them.\r\n\r\nIf Sereno Watson--who should be back again in twenty days--will only go\r\non with the Cruciferæ, which he has meddled with a deal, and then do the\r\nCaryophyllaceæ, which are in like case, we may by March 1st have all\r\ndone up to the Leguminosæ.\r\n\r\nWe learn to-day, through a pamphlet sent by Miss Horner, that Bunbury is\r\ndead--in June last....\r\n\r\nYour “Primer”--new edition--has not come yet. Do not forget it. And\r\nthen, as my manner is, I will see if I can find fault with it. Same with\r\nBentham’s “Hand-book,” new edition....\r\n\r\nI do not wonder that you are happy and contented. We should so like to\r\nsee father, mother, and children in their encampment at Sunningdale. May\r\nplenty of sunshine be theirs!\r\n\r\nBall has sent me early sheets of his book. I must find time to go\r\nthrough its pages.\r\n\r\nThe L.’s abroad, except the two girls (who are to winter at San Remo)\r\nare now en voyage homeward. William, their father, has been painted by\r\nHoll. He is a good subject. Saw your sister B. (and kind Lombe); she\r\nwrites a charming letter to my wife; seems to hold her own wonderfully.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, November 22, 1886.\r\n\r\nWell, I have got safely through my seventy-sixth birthday, which gives a\r\nsort of assurance. I have always observed that if I live to November 18,\r\nI live the year round!\r\n\r\nYou are working at Euphorbs, etc.; I at Malvaceæ, in which I find a good\r\ndeal to do for the species, and something for the betterment of\r\ngenera....\r\n\r\nTO SIR EDWARD FRY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, November 13, 1886.\r\n\r\nMY GOOD FRIEND,--Let me turn for a moment to our quarter-millennial\r\ncelebration of the foundation of our university, though you in Europe\r\nmay count our antiquity as very modern. It was an affair of three days,\r\nculminating on Monday last, and was altogether very pleasant. You will\r\nlike to know that among the honorary degrees given, was one to Professor\r\nAllen, of the Episcopal Theological School here, in recognition of the\r\nmerits of his “Continuity of Religious Thought,” which work, I am glad\r\nto remember, you much liked. The Mother Cambridge sent to us the master\r\nof St. John’s, Dr. Taylor, and Professor Creighton, of Immanuel College,\r\nto which the founders and first professors of Harvard belonged. Mrs.\r\nCreighton came with him, and we found them pleasant people. I suppose\r\nLowell’s oration, Holmes’s poem, and the doings in general will be in\r\nprint before very long, and I shall not forget to send you a copy.\r\n\r\nWe have been away from Cambridge very little this last summer and\r\nautumn, only on very short visits, or one rather longer one to my\r\nbirthplace in the central portion of New York, where we had a family\r\ngathering.\r\n\r\nThere is a lull just now in your political situation. I certainly at\r\nyour last election should have gone against Gladstone! How so many of my\r\ncountrymen--I mean thoughtful people--approve of homerule, i.e., of\r\nsemi-secession, I hardly understand. But local government as to local\r\naffairs is our strength, and is what we are brought up to. Also, our\r\nsafety is in that the land--the agricultural land--is so largely owned\r\nby the tiller....\r\n\r\nWe should like to see old friends in England once more in the flesh, and\r\nthe feeling grows so that I may feign a scientific necessity, and we\r\nmay, if we live and thrive, cross over to you next summer. At least we\r\ndream of it, though it may never come to pass.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 18, 1887.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOOKER,--Glad to see the “Botanical Magazine” figure of Nymphæa\r\nflava †.6917.\r\n\r\nThere is something not quite right in the history as you give it.\r\nLeitner was the botanist who showed the plant to Audubon, and gave it\r\nthe name which Audubon cites, and he died--was killed by the Florida\r\nIndians--“half a century ago.” He was the “a naturalist” you refer to.\r\n\r\nThe whole history and the mode of growth, stolons, etc., has been\r\nrepeatedly published here in the journals, etc. See Watson’s “Index”\r\nSupplement, etc. Not that this is any matter, even about poor Leitner.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 25, 1887.\r\n\r\n... Yes, it has seemed to me clear that you could not cross the Atlantic\r\nat present. And so it logically follows that we must.\r\n\r\nI had been coming to this conclusion, and only the day before your\r\nletter arrived my good wife and I had put our heads together and\r\nconcluded that, if nothing occurred meanwhile to prevent, we would cross\r\nover, say in April. It is time we set about it, if we are ever to do it;\r\nand several things seem to indicate that this is a more favorable time\r\nthan we can expect later.\r\n\r\nAs this will be “positively Dr. Gray’s last appearance on your shores,”\r\nwe must make the most of it. Shall we have a Continental jaunt together,\r\nor shall you be too much tied to home?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I must work hard and steadily....\r\n\r\nAs you “weed out” surplus of herbarium Kew, keep them for me. When I\r\ncome I will take care of them. It is (as usual) good of you to think of\r\nus. You have done so for so long a time that it is only “second\r\nnature”--very good nature too.\r\n\r\nWilliamson, plant-fossil, long ago begged us to come to British\r\nAssociation at Manchester, and be his guests. If I do, what think you of\r\nmy preparing a paper for Botanical Section; and will you join me in it?\r\ntwo venerables--_anglice_ old fogies--on Nomenclature and Citations.\r\n\r\nThere are some points I should like to argue out and explain; to put on\r\nrecord, though it may be of no use. Not that one wants to get up a\r\ndiscussion in such a body--that would never do....\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 22.\r\n\r\nThank you for sending me your edition of Bentham’s “Handbook,” which\r\nlooks well in its more condensed shape, and in which I dare say you have\r\nput a good deal of conscientious work. But it seems to me that Reeve &\r\nCompany give it poor type and paper.\r\n\r\nI am putting through a rehash of my “Lessons in Botany,”[140] more\r\ncondensed, yet fuller, and with a new name. This, with the companion\r\nbook, which I must live to do over, _Deo favente_, is the principal\r\nthing for bread, and I need it for an endowment to keep up the herbarium\r\nhere, after my time.\r\n\r\nWell,--don’t speak of it aloud,--we have secured our passages for April\r\n7, and if I can get present work off my hands in time, we may be on your\r\nsoil soon after Easter.\r\n\r\nYou may imagine me very busy, indeed.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray, with Mrs. Gray, landed in England, April 18, and went from\r\nLiverpool to stay at Sunningdale with Sir Joseph and Lady Hooker, where\r\na quiet, restful week was most pleasantly passed. He went to London the\r\nfirst of May for a few days, meeting again old friends, dining with\r\nthem, and dropping in for calls, “to report himself,” as he said. He did\r\na little work at Kew, going back and forth; then crossed to Paris,\r\nfinding at the Jardin des Plantes what he had especially wanted to see,\r\nLamarck’s herbarium, which had been acquired since he was last there. It\r\ncompleted satisfactorily his studies in Asters, as he had now seen\r\neverything of the genus to be found in herbaria of importance.\r\n\r\nA journey in Normandy with Sir J. D. Hooker had been planned for May,\r\nbut Sir Joseph was unable to leave England, so Dr. Gray arranged to go\r\nto Vienna. He greatly enjoyed the railroad journey from Bâle, in May,\r\nthe fruit-trees white with blossoms about Lake Zurich, then the wilder\r\nmountain scenery, and Salzburg, all bringing back the memories of his\r\nfirst European journey forty-eight years before.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nHERBARIUM, KEW, April 23, 1887.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DE CANDOLLE,--You will be a little surprised at the sudden\r\ntransfer of Mrs. Gray and myself to England; but I wanted a vacation and\r\none more bit of pleasant travel with Mrs. Gray while we are both alive\r\nand capable of enjoying it. Whether I shall look in upon you at Geneva\r\nis doubtful, but it may be, even for a moment. We never expect to have\r\nrepeated the pleasant week at Geneva of the spring of 1881.\r\n\r\nWe expect to go to Paris early in May, but subsequent movements are\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nAlways, dear De Candolle, affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\nMay 15, 1887.\r\n\r\nI think the journey from Bâle, in Switzerland, to Salzburg was\r\nwonderfully fine and a great success, and that May is a good time to do\r\nit, while there is plenty of snow in the mountains. Lake Wallenstadt\r\nshowed to great advantage. And I had no idea that the pass of the\r\nArlberg, from Feldkirk to Innspruck, was so high or so very fine. I\r\nbelieve it is the highest railway pass across the Alps. I was quite\r\nunprepared (which was all the better) for the exquisite and wild, and in\r\nparts grand, scenery of the next day’s journey through the heart of\r\nLower Tyrol and the Salzburg Salzkammergut, by a slower train, a\r\nroundabout road making more than twice the direct distance from\r\nInnspruck to Salzburg, through the Zillerthal and over a fairly high\r\npass on to the upper part of the Salzach, and down it through some wild\r\ncañons into the plain, from nine A.M. till five, of choicest scenery.\r\nThe great castle, so picturesquely placed in the Lichtenstein (plain),\r\nis Schloss-Werden. Rainy day at Salzburg, or should have had noble\r\nviews. If the weather had been good, I think we would have driven from\r\nSalzburg to Ischl, and then come by the Traunsee to Linz. But after all,\r\nfrom my remembrance, it would hardly have come up to what we had already\r\nseen. And though it was a rainy day for the Danube, we did see\r\neverything pretty well, and most comfortably, in the ladies’ cabin of\r\nthe steamer, with windows all round the three sides, and most of the\r\ntime the whole to ourselves, or with only one quiet lady, who evidently\r\ncared nothing for the views. J. says I was bobbing all the time from one\r\nside to the other. I was looking out for the views which I had when\r\ngoing up the Danube forty-eight years ago. J. thinks it not equal to the\r\nRhine, but there is rather more of it, or scattered over more space.\r\n\r\nTO SIR J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nHÔTEL BEAU RIVAGE, GENEVA, May 24, 1887.\r\n\r\nI do believe we shall have to return to America to thaw out. Here we\r\narrive in Geneva this morning, full of memories of delightful summer,\r\nten days earlier than this in 1881, to find snow down even to foothills\r\nof the Jura and on Mont Salève; it came two days ago, and the air,\r\nthough clear, is very chilly, which is not to my liking.\r\n\r\nVienna was much better, excepting our last day, which had a cold and\r\nhigh wind, and our night journey to Munich was cold and comfortless, in\r\nspite of the best appliances.\r\n\r\nI have nothing new to tell you of Vienna, where we made out our full\r\nweek, quite enjoyingly.\r\n\r\nBesides the normal sight-seeing, and drives around this truly\r\nmagnificent city, we went one afternoon to the astronomical observatory\r\nout at Wahring (Weiss and wife being old acquaintances), and next day\r\nthey went with us to the Prater. Körner and daughter took us to\r\nSchönbrunn. I went with these to a meeting of the Academy of Sciences;\r\nhad a good turn around the new and immense, but mostly yet unarranged,\r\nNatural History Museum with Hauer, the director, and Steindachner, the\r\nzoölogical curator; had a look at the Hofherbarium on the upper floor,\r\nnow under charge of a young man, Beck (and looked up some of Haenke’s\r\nthings there). How different from forty-eight years ago, when Endlicher\r\nwas curator, Fenzl, assistant, and the former took me out to the Botanic\r\nGarden to call on old Jacquin, etc. Steindachner, who was with Agassiz\r\nfor a year or two at Cambridge, would have us come to his house for our\r\nlast evening; Süss[141] and frau to meet us,--charming couple; would\r\nhave been lots more, but we cut it short; had a jolly, pleasant evening.\r\nKörner was prevented from coming. He has been asked to take\r\nEichler’s[142] place at Berlin; a botanic garden man and good teacher.\r\nWeisner’s physiological laboratory I had an hour or two in, and saw all\r\nhis gimcracks; some nice ones. Saturday evening we went by rail to\r\nSalzburg (at day-dawn); Munich at sunrise, not stopping; on to Ulm soon\r\nafter ten A.M. Bad weather kept Mrs. Gray indoors all day Sunday, though\r\nI ran about. Monday morning she had with me a good look over Ulm\r\nminster, inside and out; the upper part of the spire is rebuilding, and\r\nis to be carried up with the true taper, according to the original plan.\r\nThat sight-seeing done, we came yesterday to, and across, the Lake\r\nConstance, to Zurich, for late afternoon and evening, and on to Geneva\r\novernight.\r\n\r\nI passed an hour this morning with De Candolle,--aged, but fairly\r\ncheerful,--and he begged me to breakfast with him to-morrow. Müller\r\nArgoviensis was not at his post.\r\n\r\nWhat a season you have had, and what a fiasco Normandy would have been,\r\nas you say. Why, the apple blossoms are only now out here. We did have\r\ncomfortable, warm and dry weather at Vienna, and the Belvidere gallery\r\nis most enjoyable. Berlin we don’t in the least care for; but our faces\r\nare rather set for Amsterdam, Antwerp, etc. If you have a call to write\r\nme soon after getting this, for a day or two you might venture\r\nAmsterdam, poste restante; but later the old address, to Hôtel St.\r\nRomain, Rue San Roque, would be the thing until further notice; add “To\r\nbe kept till called for.”\r\n\r\nI doubt if we shall be back in England before the 17th or 18th, and then\r\nMrs. Gray will have to join her luggage, left somewhere in the\r\nneighborhood of Charing Cross, where it now reposes, and we shall have\r\nto hasten down to Cambridge....\r\n\r\nWe have had an enjoyable time; and, I suppose, shall by day after\r\nto-morrow set off Rhine-wards, stopping, perhaps, a day at Strasburg,\r\nand by the Low Countries back to Paris, probably not to be again on this\r\nside of the Channel, unless you and Lady H. will take a trip to Normandy\r\nwith us, either in August or September.\r\n\r\nI hope you will soon have done with Phyllanthus, and that you will not\r\nhesitate to restore as many old genera as your own judgment dictates.\r\nYour experience and present insight must exceed Bentham’s. And what you\r\nmust needs indicate, the next man will take up, and probably cackle\r\nover.\r\n\r\nMy wife joins in love to yours and you; will be likely to write when she\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Geneva the old journey of 1850 was nearly repeated, and Dr. Gray\r\ncame down the Rhine, by rail this time, to Brussels, Amsterdam, the\r\nHague, back to Antwerp and Brussels, and so to Paris. Besides meeting\r\nold friends, the object of the journey, he said, was to have one more\r\ngood look at picture-galleries and churches and cathedrals; and great\r\nwas his enjoyment of them, unwearied his wanderings about the places\r\nwhere he stopped. The new galleries at Amsterdam and Brussels, and their\r\nsuperb collections, delighted him, and the grand music of the cathedrals\r\nand their noble interiors seemed a new source of pleasure.\r\n\r\nHe missed his old friends in Paris; Decaisne was gone, and Lavallée,\r\netc. He went to a meeting at the Institute, and saw Chevreuil, who had\r\npassed his hundredth birthday, but spoke a few words with life and\r\nanimation. There were some excursions in the neighborhood, and some work\r\nin the herbarium, where he received every kind attention.\r\n\r\nTO ----,\r\n\r\nPARIS, June, 1887.\r\n\r\n... The views on the garden and park side of the Palace of\r\nFontainebleau, and over the carp pond, which came up to the walls, were\r\nvery pretty; partly clipped and trimmed trees made into green walls,\r\npartly more English.\r\n\r\n... At half past one, in an open light carriage with a canopy overhead,\r\nkeeping off the hot sun, and letting through the fresh air, we were off\r\nfor our two hours’ drive through the famous forest. The main avenues,\r\nlong and straight, and formal; but the forest was voted very handsome. A\r\nchange came when we reached the ruin of the hermitage of Franchard, and\r\nthe extensive region of rocks and dells. We were taken through by an old\r\nguide, who, with much pride, paraded the little and queer English he had\r\npicked up, and showed off all the sights, the most important to him\r\nbeing those in which bits of rock could be likened to a lion’s head, a\r\nbeef’s tongue, a turtle, and the like. First and foremost, in a sort of\r\nover-arched grotto, was “La roche qui pleure,” a great disappointment! A\r\nsort of crack or joint between two layers of the rock exuded a little\r\nmoisture in one spot; _voilà tout_. We shed about as many tears in our\r\nlaughter at the sight; more indeed, for we could see not a drop. I dare\r\nsay at some seasons there may be a little drip. But the dells among the\r\nrocks were fine, and the stories of the boar hunts, and all that, by the\r\nkings and queens and courtiers, could be made fairly real on the spot,\r\nand the famous points of view, one of Maria Theresa, one of Eugénie,\r\nwere effective. A drive back by another route took us through some older\r\nforest; occasionally a really old tree, and one truly old and large\r\nlinden. There may be parts in which there are trees as large and\r\nvenerable as in old English parks, but we saw only this one old tree.\r\nThe forest is very large, and we had to be content with this one drive.\r\nWe might have had one hour more of it, for we had all that to wait for\r\nour train back to Paris, very pleasant as it cooled at evening.\r\n\r\nJune 9, I at work at Jardin des Plantes, but back at noon, and at half\r\npast twelve we drive across Paris to the Gare de Sceaux and out to\r\nVilmorin’s. At Massy, where we leave the railway, Henry de Vilmorin\r\nawaited us, with his nice carriage, and took us to the charming place at\r\nVerrières, so full to us of recollections. It is prettier than ever, the\r\nhouse enlarged and so full of very nice things. V. and I were most of\r\nthe time in the grounds, looking at plants, back to afternoon tea and\r\ncake, which we much enjoyed, being hungry, and to accommodate us they\r\nput forward the dinner hour to six. Besides the children and English\r\ngoverness, we had at dinner a very interesting abbé, with a charming,\r\nintellectual face, and a manner to match--a Monsignor; for he takes that\r\ntitle as a member of the Pope’s household or personal staff. He had\r\npassed a portion of his life at Moscow, as the curé of a French Catholic\r\nchurch there, had seen a good deal of the Roman Catholic bishop of\r\nChicago and other American brothers; was a good deal interested in\r\nAmerica, and after the ice was broken and he found he could understand\r\nJ.’s French, and even mine, which amused as well as instructed him, we\r\nhad much chat. We had to break off. Vilmorin drove us back a few miles\r\nto Fontenay-la-Rose, to take a particular train, and so we were at our\r\nquarters in Rue St. Roche before dark. That need not mean very early,\r\nfor the days here are wonderfully protracted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe crossed to England June 14, passed a day or two in London, and then\r\nwent to the Camp, quite glorious with the rhododendrons in blossom; and\r\nwith Sir Joseph and Lady Hooker, on the 18th, went to Cambridge, where\r\nthey were the guests of Mrs. Darwin. A delightful Sunday was spent in\r\nmeeting old friends, and on Monday were all the ceremonies, new and\r\nstrange, of conferring of degrees. The great sensation of the day was\r\nthe presence of the Lord Mayor with all his train; he also was to have a\r\ndegree.... No one can surpass Dr. Sandys in the felicity with which he\r\npresents the distinguished men whom Cambridge University honors with its\r\nhighest degrees. In his presentation of Dr. Gray, he said (we translate\r\nfrom the exquisite Latin):\r\n\r\n“And now we are glad to come to the Harvard professor of Natural\r\nHistory, facile princeps of transatlantic botanists. Within the period\r\nof fifty years, how many books has he written about his fairest science;\r\nhow rich in learning, how admirable in style! How many times has he\r\ncrossed the ocean that he might more carefully study European herbaria,\r\nand better know the leading men in his own department! In examining,\r\nreviewing and sometimes gracefully correcting the labors of others, what\r\na shrewd, honest and urbane critic has he proved himself to be! How\r\ncheerfully, many years ago, among his own western countrymen was he the\r\nfirst of all to greet the rising sun of our own Darwin, believing his\r\ntheory of the origin of various forms of life demanded some First\r\nCause, and was in harmony with a faith in a Deity who has created and\r\ngoverns all things! God grant that it may be allowed such a man at\r\nlength to carry to a happy completion that great work, which he long ago\r\nbegan, of more accurately describing the flora of North America!\r\nMeanwhile, this man who has so long adorned his fair science by his\r\nlabors and his life, even unto a hoary age, ‘bearing,’ as our poet says,\r\n‘the white blossom of a blameless life,’ him, I say, we gladly crown, at\r\nleast with these flowerets of praise, with this corolla of honor (his\r\nsaltem laudis flosculis, hac saltem honoris corolla, libenter\r\ncoronamus). For many, many years may Asa Gray, the venerable priest of\r\nFlora, render more illustrious this academic crown.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEngland was in a stir with the Queen’s Jubilee; it was impossible to be\r\nin London on the twenty-first, as Dr. Gray must get to Oxford to receive\r\nhis degree on the twenty-second, and a good part of the day was used in\r\ncrossing country by various railroads; but the sight of the crowds, the\r\ndecorations, the bands everywhere, was very interesting, and the\r\nenthusiasm contagious. Oxford had its gay share of illumination in the\r\nevening, and the next day Dr. Gray received his degree with several\r\nothers, among them his old Cambridge acquaintance, Story, the sculptor.\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\nBLACHFORD, Sunday, July 2.\r\n\r\n... I am to add some supplementary notes.\r\n\r\nAt the Cambridge University lunch, I had Mrs. Jebb assigned to me to\r\ntake in. Oscar Browning took the seat on my right. Opposite was a man I\r\nwas glad to see, Lord Acton,--middle-aged, of high scholarship and\r\nadmirable taste, who fought a long and losing battle against the\r\nsuperstitious tendencies of his (Roman Catholic) church; and after lunch\r\nI had a pleasant conversation with him; was glad to find he was one of\r\nthe new D. C. L. crew at Oxford, where I again saw something of him. He\r\nhas been in the United States when only a baronet.\r\n\r\nAt the Oxford Christ Church dinner I was placed at the high table, only\r\ntwo away from the Dean’s left, the two Dr. Jellett, provost of Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin (who was doctored), and the bishop of Gibraltar. On my\r\nleft was Talbot, the warden of Keble College (the very high church one),\r\nand I know little of what I ate or drank, for we had a steady stream of\r\nconversation on high topics, treated with immense frankness on both\r\nsides. Dr. Jellett made the return-thanks speech for all four of the\r\nnew-made Doctors present,--himself, Story, Dr. Wright, Arabic professor\r\nat Cambridge, and myself, a speech full of Irish humor. That was\r\narranged to be all. But the lower tables somehow knew by instinct what\r\nStory wanted, and called him out. He made a rather funny speech. Then\r\nLiddon had to move thanks to the president of the feast, the Dean\r\n(Liddell), and a capital speech he made, even to my apprehension. I saw\r\nthat there was a good deal between the lines in what he was saying, but\r\ndid not know the half of it till I was told afterwards. Paget, my host,\r\nwas opposite me. Prestwich, whom I had not before got sight of, was next\r\nhim. It was a long affair, but very pleasant to me.\r\n\r\nNext morning was the call on Professor Bartholomew Price and wife, in a\r\ncharming old house, meeting Tylor and Maspero; then we went to the\r\nMuseum, giving our time there to the new well-contrived Pitt-River\r\nMuseum of Ethnology; then walked to Acland’s and made a long call on his\r\ndaughter, who seemed pleased, and we certainly were to see her again,\r\nand looking well, though a sufferer and invalid. The dinner at\r\nBalfour’s, J. will describe.\r\n\r\nFriday, at ten o’clock, the Hookers called with a carriage, and we drove\r\nto Nuneham, seven miles, where Colonel Harcourt, older brother of Sir\r\nWilliam Harcourt, had invited us to see the place and lunch. It is one\r\nof the principal seats of the Harcourt family,--not the oldest, which is\r\non the Thames much higher up--and is in view from the railway to London,\r\na handsome but externally rather plain pile, and so full of remarkable\r\nthings. As soon as we arrived we were shown through most of the house by\r\nColonel H., and some of the historical curiosities were brought out....\r\nThere is an unparalleled gallery of original portraits of British poets,\r\nmostly given by themselves, almost all of them....\r\n\r\nThe “omnibus” had been ordered, and we drove through the park, into the\r\narboretum, and through it by winding roads were landed at the\r\nconservatory and gardens, the dairy, the ornamental grounds, filled with\r\nstatues, etc., inscriptions in verse and prose set up by the wits of the\r\ntimes of George II. and III. In the house we were shown some of the\r\nletters, of which there is a vast quantity, now being sorted and\r\narranged in volumes and indexed. One volume is of those of George III.,\r\nbeginning with those when a small boy, and badly spelled, ending with\r\nsome when an old man and insane. Then a walk along the terrace and the\r\nside commanding the fine views, from some points Oxford dimly seen in\r\nthe distance; then the lunch.\r\n\r\nOur carriage was announced, and we took leave, a shorter way through the\r\npark being pointed out. Got back to Oxford just in time to take leave of\r\nH. (her husband out) and take a fly to train, and so to London;\r\nseparated from the Hookers, who had to take a slip car, to be dropped at\r\nReading. We went straight to Paddington without stop, and thence in a\r\ncab to the Deanery, where our dear good friends awaited us.\r\n\r\nSaturday afternoon, we were all going with the Churches to the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury’s garden party at Lambeth Palace, when, at\r\nbreakfast, Mrs. C. got an invitation from Mrs. Gladstone to hers, at\r\nDollys Hill, up near Harrow, and the question of dividing forces came\r\nup. It was settled, as I wished, by Mrs. C., Fred, and I going by\r\nunderground to the Gladstones, while J. and the Misses C. went by\r\ncarriage to Lambeth. Mrs. Gladstone sent her carriage down to the\r\nstation, a mile off, which took us up to a pleasant country house, which\r\nsome one (I think Lord Aberdeen) has lent to the G. O. M. It was all\r\nlucky for me. At Oxford, Bryce had asked me to his dinner for July 6,\r\nwhere he said Gladstone wanted to meet me, and our engagements here made\r\nthat impossible. At the garden party, while we were there, the people\r\nwere few and a good chance to talk. Mrs. Gladstone was most gracious.\r\nGladstone said he was very glad to see me in the flesh, and we had\r\npleasant talk, of nothing in particular. Lord Granville sought an\r\nintroduction, asked Lowell, who was there, to introduce him, and then\r\nintroduced his brother, Lord Leveson Gower, and afterward his son. Then\r\nI was put at the tea-table at the side of Miss Gladstone, the principal\r\nof Newnham College at Cambridge, a most bright and pleasant person; and\r\nafter a long talk, a lady with a very pleasant and handsome face pushed\r\nin a chair between us and asked an introduction,--Lady Lyttleton.... I\r\nmet her next day at evening, at Mr. Talbot’s (M. P.) house, where I went\r\nto be taken to a good seat at St. Margaret’s Church, Westminster, now\r\nserving for the Abbey, to hear Talbot, the warden of Keble, preach.\r\n\r\nSunday morning, to continue my separate doings, I went to the Temple\r\nChurch, to hear the very sweet music, better in my opinion than that of\r\nSt. Paul’s, and to hear the chaplain (Master is his proper title),\r\nVaughan. Capital sermon it was. Afternoon I was quiet. At seven o’clock\r\nI went to Westminster to hear Talbot, the warden of Keble. These very\r\nhigh clergymen have a way of preaching broad-minded sermons. Talbot’s\r\nmight have been preached by Phillips Brooks, or even by A. P. Peabody,\r\nexcept for an incidental phrase or two, and except for some posturing at\r\nthe prayers. So my idea of the man, as a man of excellent sense, in\r\nspite of his setting in a very superstitious school, was confirmed.\r\n\r\nTyndall dinner; here as a guest, I was the third on the left of the\r\nchairman (Stokes, president of Royal Society), only Lord Bathurst and\r\nLord Derby between. The speaking I thought heavy enough, except for Lord\r\nDerby’s speech, which was pointed and witty, and Lord Rayleigh’s, at the\r\nend, which was neat and sensible. Met there (in Willis’s Rooms; the\r\ndinner was in the Almack’s ballroom of old days) a good many old\r\nacquaintances, and of course had a good time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom London, after more entertainments, Dr. Gray went to Devonshire,\r\nwhere he made a charming visit at Blachford with his friends Lord and\r\nLady Blachford; most interesting excursions followed over the downs, a\r\nday up the Tamar to Cothele; and he made other visits on the way back,\r\none to his old Cambridge friend, Mrs. James, near Exeter, where he had\r\nan afternoon call at Killerton, Sir Thomas Acland’s, and saw the fine\r\nbeeches, etc.; returned to London, where there was much visiting before\r\nhe went to Edinburgh for another degree. On the way to the north he\r\nvisited the grounds of Welbeck, and saw the fine trees of Sherwood\r\n(Robin Hood’s) forest,--beeches, and grand, hoar old oaks.\r\n\r\nFrom Edinburgh Dr. Gray went through England to Normandy, meeting Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker and his party at Rouen; then came a delightful trip given\r\nto churches and cathedrals.\r\n\r\nHe wrote: “Bayeux and Coutances surprised us, they are so very good;\r\nonly Amiens and St. Ouen can compare with them in beauty, especially\r\ninterior views.\r\n\r\n“No two of all these Normandy churches are alike; even those of\r\nessentially similar style differ both within and without so much that\r\nyou would not wish to miss any one. Those old church builders were\r\ngeniuses, and worked by inspiration.”\r\n\r\nHe gave a day to Mont St. Michel, and then separating from the Hookers\r\nhe went to Chartres, to see it again after thirty years, and by Rouen\r\nand Amiens returned to England; when came an interesting visit to\r\nHarpenden to Dr. and Mrs. Gilbert, viewing the famous experiments in\r\nagriculture at Rothampstead. And the seeing of cathedrals was closed by\r\na most delightful and busy day at Canterbury with Canon and Mrs.\r\nFremantle.\r\n\r\nAt the end of August he went to Manchester to attend the meeting of the\r\nBritish Association, and he and Mrs. Gray were guests of Professor\r\nWilliamson; De Bary and M. de Saporta being also under the same\r\nhospitable roof. It was an unusual assemblage of botanists, and a very\r\nenjoyable occasion.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray seconded Sir Henry Roscoe’s address at the opening of the\r\nmeeting with this short speech:--\r\n\r\n“For the very great honor of being called upon to second the motion for\r\na vote of thanks to your illustrious president, I am mainly indebted to\r\nthat deference which is naturally accorded to advancing years; a\r\ndeference which sometimes, as in the present case, takes one unawares.\r\n\r\n“In looking over the list of Corresponding Members of the British\r\nAssociation, I find myself, much to my surprise, nearly, if not quite,\r\nthe oldest survivor.\r\n\r\n“I recognize, therefore, a certain fitness, on this score, in the call\r\nupon me to be the spokesman of those, your brethren from other lands,\r\nwho have been invited to this auspicious gathering, and to the privilege\r\nof listening to the very thoughtful, well-timed, and most instructive\r\naddress of your president.\r\n\r\n“As guests, we desire, Mr. Mayor, heartily to thank the City of\r\nManchester and the officers of the Association for inviting us; we wish\r\nto thank you, Sir Henry, for the gratification your address has afforded\r\nus.\r\n\r\n“Convened at Manchester, and coming myself by way of Liverpool, I would\r\nsay, personally, that there are two names which memory calls up from the\r\ndistant past, with unusual distinctness, both names familiar to this\r\naudience, and well-known over the world, but which now rise to my mind\r\nin a very significant way. For I am old enough to have taken my\r\nearliest lessons in chemistry just at the time when the atomic theory of\r\nDalton was propounded and was taught in the text-books as the latest new\r\nthing in science. Some years earlier, Washington Irving, in his\r\nSketch-book, had hallowed to our youthful minds the name of Roscoe,\r\nmaking it the type of all that was liberal, wise, and gracious. And when\r\nI came to know something of botany, I found that this exemplar as well\r\nas patron of good learning had, by his illustrations of monandrian\r\nplants, taken rank among the _patres conscripti_ of the botany of that\r\nday.\r\n\r\n“The name so highly honored then we now honor in the grandson. And I am\r\nconfident that I express the sentiments of your foreign guests whom I\r\nrepresent, when I simply copy the words of your president in 1842, now\r\nreproduced in the opening paragraph of the address of the president of\r\n1887, transferring, as we fitly may, the application from the earlier to\r\nthe later Manchester chemist.\r\n\r\n“‘Manchester is still the residence of one whose name is uttered with\r\nrespect wherever science is cultivated, who is here to-night to enjoy\r\nthe honors due to a long career of persevering devotion to knowledge.’\r\n\r\n“I cannot continue the quotation without material change. ‘That increase\r\nof years to him has been but increase of wisdom,’ may, indeed be said of\r\nRoscoe no less than of Dalton; but we are happy to know that we are now\r\ncontemplating not the diminished strength of the close, but the manly\r\nvigor of the midcourse of a distinguished career. Long and prosperously\r\nmay it go on from strength to strength.\r\n\r\n“In general, praise of the address which we have had the pleasure of\r\nhearing would not be particularly becoming from one whose chemistry\r\nnearly ended as well as began with the simple atomic theory of Dalton.\r\nBut there is one topic which I may properly speak of, standing as I do\r\nas a representative of those favored individuals which your programme,\r\nfor lack of a better distinguishing word, calls ‘foreigners.’ I refer to\r\nthe urgently expressed ‘hope that this meeting may be the commencement\r\nof an international scientific organization.’ For this we thank you, Mr.\r\nPresident, most heartily. This is, indeed, a consummation devoutly to be\r\nwished, and confidently to be hoped for by all of us, especially by\r\nthose for whom I am speaking.\r\n\r\n“Not only we Americans, who are of British descent, and who never forget\r\nthat blood is thicker than water, but as well our Continental associates\r\non this platform, of the various strains of blood which, interfused,\r\nhave produced this English race and fitted it for its noble issues,--we,\r\neach and all, I repeat, accept this name of ‘foreigners’ only in the\r\nconventional sense which the imperfection of the language imposes. In\r\nthe forum of science we ignore it altogether. One purpose unifies and\r\nanimates every scientific mind with ‘one divine intent,’ and that by no\r\nmeans the ‘far-off intent’ of which the poet sings, but one very near\r\nand pervading. So we took to heart the closing words of your president’s\r\nmost pertinent and timely address. Indeed, we had taken them to heart in\r\nanticipation, and so have come to this meeting, one hundred strong or\r\nmore (in place of the ordinary score) fully bent upon making this\r\nManchester meeting international.\r\n\r\n“Far back in my youthful days there was a strong-willed President of the\r\nUnited States, of military antecedents, who once drew up and promulgated\r\nan official order which somewhat astounded his cabinet officers. ‘Why,\r\nMr. President,’ they said, ‘you can’t do that.’ ‘Can’t do it?’ replied\r\nGeneral Jackson; ‘Don’t you see that I have done it?’ And so we\r\ninternationals have come and done it. I am the unworthy spokesman of\r\nsuch a numerous and such a distinguished array of scientific foreigners\r\nas have never been assembled before. Next year, if you will, you shall\r\nhave as many more. When you too are ready to cross the Channel or the\r\nNorth Sea, we shall compose only a larger scientific brotherhood. And\r\nwhen you cross again the Atlantic, the brotherhood of science will be\r\nthe more increased, and its usefulness in proportion.\r\n\r\n“In behalf of your foreign guests, I heartily second the motion.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Manchester Dr. Gray went to Failand, to his friend Sir Edward Fry;\r\nthen followed a visit to Miss North, in Gloucestershire, where he met,\r\namong others, Mr. and Mrs. Elwes,[143] and drove one day to Tortworth to\r\nlunch with Lord and Lady Ducie; then to Kew. A few days there with his\r\nkind friends, Dr. and Mrs. Oliver, a farewell visit to his old friend,\r\nMiss Sullivan, at Broom House, to the Camp to say goodby to the Hookers,\r\nand finally to Liverpool to sail in the Pavonia, October 7. Just six\r\nmonths, as Dr. Gray said, of wonderful enjoyment and success; everything\r\nhad gone as it should, there were no mishaps, the days had run on as\r\neach had been planned, and he came home in wonderful vigor and spirits.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 24, 1887.\r\n\r\nDEAR REDFIELD,--Thanks, many, for letter of the 22d....\r\n\r\nWe have had “a good time,” and after long play I am getting down to\r\nwork....\r\n\r\nThanks to you all for your congratulations, in which my good wife\r\nsincerely joins.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nHERBARIUM OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY.\r\nBOTANIC GARDEN, CAMBRIDGE, MASS., October, 1887.\r\n\r\nDEAR HOOKER,--Your welcome letter in this morning. I was just writing a\r\nnotice of Ampelideæ, and your remarks are in time for me to sharpen it\r\nup a bit. I think I can smash his notice about Ampelopsis.\r\n\r\nWho is Miss Grant, who says she knows you both? She sculps, I believe.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nThere was much to do on getting home and settling down again, and many\r\nthings were planned for the winter’s work. Dr. Gray particularly wished\r\nto write some accounts of the old botanists he had seen in his earlier\r\nvisits, being stirred thereto by Reichenbach[144] of Hamburg, and by the\r\nstories he told one evening at Dr. Oliver’s, at Kew, when all agreed it\r\nwas a pity some of these characteristic things should not go on record.\r\nHe took up work on the “Flora,” wrote a review of “Darwin’s Life and\r\nLetters,” and had a busy time before him.\r\n\r\nProfessor Baird, director of the Smithsonian, and an old friend, had\r\ndied during the summer, and Dr. Gray, from his long connection with the\r\ninstitution, was much interested in the appointment of his successor. He\r\nwent on in November to Washington to a special meeting of the Regents,\r\nwhen Professor Langley was appointed; wrote from Washington of the\r\nwonderful amount he had done in one day, and hurried back; liking\r\nalways, if he could, to surprise those at home by being somewhat earlier\r\nthan he had promised. He began the Annual Necrology for the “American\r\nJournal of Science.” He was already at work on the Vitaceæ for the\r\n“Flora.”\r\n\r\nHe went in to Boston for the family Thanksgiving dinner, though there\r\nhad seemed some threatening of a cold, but he pronounced himself\r\nperfectly comfortable. Still there was a quick breathing and some\r\nlistlessness, so that he was nursed a little on Friday; though he saw\r\nMiss Murfree, who had been brought by Mrs. Houghton to ask him to settle\r\nsome question about a flower of the Southern Alleghanies, and he entered\r\ninto the matter with all his old life and eagerness. That evening he had\r\ntwo slight chills, so that the doctor was summoned the next day, and\r\nfearing some chest trouble, as he seemed threatened with one of his\r\nbronchial attacks, advised him to keep in bed. On Sunday his pulse and\r\ntemperature had improved so much that he was allowed to get up and go\r\ndown stairs at noon, the doctor congratulating him on the success of the\r\ntreatment. There seemed a weakness of the right hand, which, however,\r\npassed away, and he wrote that evening the letter to Dr. Britton, which\r\nfollows, and when remonstrated with for making the exertion, said “it\r\nwas important and must be written.”\r\n\r\nSunday Evening, November 27, 1887.\r\n\r\nDEAR DR. BRITTON,--I wish to call your attention either in a personal\r\nway or in the “Bulletin,” if preferred, to a name coined by you on the\r\n223d page of this year’s “Bulletin.”\r\n\r\n“Conioselinum bipinnatum (Walter, Fl. Car. under Apium), Britton,\r\nSelinum Canadense, Michx., 1803.”\r\n\r\nI want to liberate my mind by insisting that the process adopted\r\nviolates the rules of nomenclature by giving a superfluous name to a\r\nplant, and also that in all reasonable probability your name is an\r\nincorrect one.\r\n\r\nTake the second point first. On glancing at the “Flora of North\r\nAmerica,” of Torrey and Gray, 1, 619, where the name Conioselinum\r\nCanadense legitimately came in, you will notice that the name Apium\r\nbipinnatum, Walt., is not cited as a synonym; also that the synonymous\r\nname of Cnidium Canadense, Spreng., is cited with “excl. Syn.” This\r\nApium bipinnatum, Walt., you might gather was one referred to.\r\nSufficient reason for the exclusion by Dr. Torrey might have been that\r\nMichaux’s plant is a cold northern one, which nobody would expect in or\r\nnear Walter’s ground--the low and low middle part of Carolina. Besides,\r\nthe preface of that “Flora” states that Walter’s herbarium had meanwhile\r\nbeen inspected by Dr. Torrey’s colleague, who may now add that the Apium\r\nbipinnatum is not there. So that the name you adopt rests wholly upon a\r\nmere guess of Sprengel’s, copied by De Candolle, dropped on good grounds\r\nby Torrey, but inadvertently reproduced in Watson’s “Index,” copying De\r\nCandolle. I suppose you would not contend that a wholly unauthenticated\r\nand dubious (I might say, doubtless mistaken) name, under a wrong\r\ngenus, should supersede by its specific half a well-authenticated and\r\nlegitimate name. And I am sure that you will not take it amiss when I\r\nsay that very long experience has made it clear to me that this business\r\nof determining rightful names is not so simple and mechanical as to\r\nyounger botanists it seems to be, but is very full of pitfalls. I trust\r\nit is no personal feeling which suggests the advice that it is better to\r\nleave such rectifications for monographs and comprehensive works, or at\r\nleast to make quite sure of the ground.\r\n\r\nWe look to you and to such as yourself, placed at well-furnished\r\nbotanical centres, to do your share of conscientious work and to support\r\nright doctrines. So I may proceed to say that, upon the recognized\r\nprinciples since the adoption of the Candollian code, your name of\r\nConioselinum bipinnatum, even if founded in fact, would be inadmissible\r\nand superfluous. By a corollary of the rule that priority of publication\r\nfixes the name, taken along with the fact a plant-name is of two parts,\r\ngeneric and specific, it follows that in any case, Conioselinum\r\nCanadense is the prior name for those who hold to the genus\r\nConioselinum. I have laid down what I take to be the correct view as to\r\nthis, in my “Structural Botany,” paragraph 794, where it is supported by\r\nthe high authority of Bentham. I believe it is more and more acceded to\r\nby the most competent judges. There are those who make transpositions of\r\ndivorced halves of plants name, and who, also make the law of priority\r\nmechanically override other equally valid laws, without regard to sense.\r\nTo such the old law maxim of the elder De Candolle was applied; _summum\r\njus, summa injuria_. If you like to adopt their ideas, you have at hand\r\na still older, the very oldest, name, namely, Conioselinum Chinense, for\r\nI can certify that the plant we are concerned with is Athamantha\r\nChinensis of Linnæus.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he seemed bright and well, but on going down to\r\nbreakfast there came a slight shock in the right arm, which seemed,\r\nhowever, to pass off after he had rested. He managed to put up, for two\r\nfriends in England, copies of his “Review of the Life of Darwin,” in the\r\n“Nation,” penciling the address so that it could be read. But a more\r\nsevere shock returned in the early afternoon, and for a few moments a\r\nloss of articulation. That disappeared and the physician looked\r\nhopefully at the case, though recommending extreme quiet for mind and\r\nbody. By Wednesday evening he seemed greatly improved, but the next\r\nmorning the power of connected speech had gone. He could repeat words\r\nspoken to him, and could sometimes, apparently with long striving,\r\nconnect the wish and the words, but for the most part he had lost the\r\npower of using the word he wanted, and could only express himself with\r\nsigns, and his “eloquent left hand;” for the paralysis gradually\r\nincreased until the whole right side was helpless. He lingered patiently\r\nin much weakness and at times suffering, until the 30th of January,\r\n1888, when he gradually sank and quietly passed away at half-past seven\r\nin the evening.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray was buried in Mount Auburn, February 2, where a simple stone,\r\nbearing a cross, marks his grave, with his name and the dates\r\n1810-1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. DR. GRAY’S WILL.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray in his will left to the herbarium the proceeds of all his\r\ncopyrights. His strong belief in the importance of a large and well-kept\r\nherbarium, as an establishment indispensable not only to the development\r\nof botanical studies at Harvard but also to the diffusion throughout the\r\nwhole country of a knowledge of its flora, is shown by this bequest, and\r\nalso by the active efforts he was constantly making in its behalf during\r\nhis life and by the personal sacrifices to which he cheerfully\r\nsubmitted, that the herbarium might profit. Some of the difficulties in\r\nthe development of his cherished project will already have suggested\r\nthemselves to the reader of these pages. Others may be touched upon\r\nbriefly here.\r\n\r\nThe reputation of Dr. Gray at home and abroad naturally served to draw\r\nto the herbarium large numbers of specimens, and the number was\r\nincreased by the purchases which he contrived to make from time to time,\r\neither from his own scanty means, or from the occasional gifts of\r\nfriends. The storing of his large and valuable collections in the small\r\nhouse in the garden where he lived was attended by so much danger of\r\ndestruction by fire that he offered to present the collection to Harvard\r\nUniversity, if a suitable building for its reception were provided; and,\r\ngreatly to his relief, his herbarium was transferred in 1864 to the new\r\nfire-proof building, for whose construction twelve thousand dollars were\r\ngiven by his liberal friend, Mr. Nathaniel Thayer.\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Gray was able during his life to secure a building which at the\r\ntime of its completion seemed ample for its purpose, he was less\r\nfortunate in his efforts to obtain a permanent fund for the maintenance\r\nof the collection. In 1864, the sum of $10,000-$12,000 was raised by\r\nfriends for its support; but the interest of all the available funds was\r\nfar short of what was necessary for the proper payment of a curator, for\r\nnecessary purchases of plants and books and for running expenses. In\r\nfact, during his lifetime, running expenses could not have been met had\r\nit not been for occasional gifts from friends of the herbarium,\r\nincluding, for several years, a grant from the Massachusetts Society for\r\nthe Promotion of Agriculture. The bequest in his will was an attempt on\r\nhis part to replace, as far as he was able, the sums obtained by him\r\nannually from various sources during his life. But even with the amount\r\nderived from the copyrights, which must, of necessity, diminish in\r\nfuture years, the endowments of the herbarium are by no means sufficient\r\nto provide for its maintenance, even on the present scale. At the time\r\nof the transfer in 1864, the herbarium contained at least two hundred\r\nthousand specimens, and the library between two and three thousand\r\nworks. Both have increased largely since that date.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. A PARTIAL LIST OF THE WRITINGS OF ASA GRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. TEXT-BOOKS AND INDEPENDENT VOLUMES.\r\n\r\n     1836. Elements of Botany.

During the fifty and more years Dr. Gray was a contributor to the\r\n“American Journal of Science,” in addition to the foregoing articles, he\r\nprinted in its pages 380 communications, devoted chiefly to critical\r\nreviews of works on botany and kindred subjects, and to biographical\r\nsketches of botanists. In 1888 appeared, as an appendix to Volume\r\nXXXVI., a list of 42 pages of the writings of Asa Gray, chronologically\r\narranged. This list, with an index, has been issued in separate form. In\r\naddition to the above, Dr. Gray contributed to the “Nation” from 1868 to\r\nNovember, 1887; and many articles to the following journals and\r\nmagazines: The New York Semi-Weekly Tribune; The American\r\nAgriculturist; Hooker’s Journal of Botany; The London Journal of Botany;\r\nJournal of the Linnæan Society; Gardener’s Chronicle; American\r\nNaturalist; Science; The New York Independent; The Botanical Gazette;\r\nThe Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club; The American Florist; The\r\nExaminer; The New Englander; The Atlantic; The Literary World; The\r\nContemporary Review; The Andover Review; The Harvard College Literary\r\nBulletin.\r\n\r\nOne publication, and that the earliest, cannot be included in any of the\r\nabove divisions. It was entitled “A Catalogue of the indigenous\r\nFlowering and Filicoid Plants growing within 20 miles of Bridgewater,\r\nOneida Co., New York.” It is signed A. Gray, M. D., January 1, 1833, and\r\nconstitutes pp. 57-65 of (N. Y.) Senate Document, No. 70.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. DEGREES CONFERRED ON ASA GRAY.\r\n\r\n    1831. College of Medicine and Surgery, Fairfield, N. Y.

No matter\r\n how wonderful, how beautiful, how intimately complex and delicate has\r\n been the machinery which has worked perhaps for centuries, perhaps for\r\n millions of ages, to bring about some beneficent result, if we can but\r\n catch a glimpse of the wheels, its divine character disappears.’\r\n\r\n “I agree with the writer that this first conclusion is premature and\r\n unworthy, I will add deplorable. Through what faults and infirmities\r\n of dogmatism on the one hand, and skepticism on the other, it came\r\n to be so thought, we need not here consider. Let us hope, and I\r\n confidently expect, that it is not to last; that the religious faith\r\n which survived without a shock the notion of the fixity of the earth\r\n itself may equally outlast the notion of the absolute fixity of the\r\n species which inhabit it; that in the future, even more than in the\r\n past, faith in an order, which is the basis of science, will not,\r\n as it cannot reasonably, be dissevered from faith in an Ordainer,\r\n which is the basis of religion.”--“Sequoia and its History,” in\r\n _Darwiniana_, p. 205.\r\n\r\n [93] This was the beginning of summer schools in Harvard University.\r\n\r\n [94] “Life of Charles Darwin,” in _Nature_, June 4, 1874.\r\n\r\n [95] See vol. xxxiv. n. ser., November, 1862, pp. 428, 429.--A.
