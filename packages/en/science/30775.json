Minor typos have been corrected and footnotes moved to the\r\nend of the chapters. The italic markup for single italized\r\nletters (such as variables in equations) and weight abbreviations are\r\ndeleted for easier reading.\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT OF THE TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very high character of Mr Lavoisier as a chemical philosopher, and\r\nthe great revolution which, in the opinion of many excellent chemists,\r\nhe has effected in the theory of chemistry, has long made it much\r\ndesired to have a connected account of his discoveries, and of the new\r\ntheory he has founded upon the modern experiments written by himself.\r\nThis is now accomplished by the publication of his Elements of\r\nChemistry; therefore no excuse can be at all necessary for giving the\r\nfollowing work to the public in an English dress; and the only\r\nhesitation of the Translator is with regard to his own abilities for the\r\ntask. He is most ready to confess, that his knowledge of the composition\r\nof language fit for publication is far inferior to his attachment to\r\nthe subject, and to his desire of appearing decently before the judgment\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nHe has earnestly endeavoured to give the meaning of the Author with the\r\nmost scrupulous fidelity, having paid infinitely greater attention to\r\naccuracy of translation than to elegance of stile. This last indeed, had\r\nhe even, by proper labour, been capable of attaining, he has been\r\nobliged, for very obvious reasons, to neglect, far more than accorded\r\nwith his wishes. The French copy did not reach his hands before the\r\nmiddle of September; and it was judged necessary by the Publisher that\r\nthe Translation should be ready by the commencement of the University\r\nSession at the end of October.\r\n\r\nHe at first intended to have changed all the weights and measures used\r\nby Mr Lavoisier into their correspondent English denominations, but,\r\nupon trial, the task was found infinitely too great for the time\r\nallowed; and to have executed this part of the work inaccurately, must\r\nhave been both useless and misleading to the reader. All that has been\r\nattempted in this way is adding, between brackets ( ), the degrees of\r\nFahrenheit's scale corresponding with those of Reaumeur's thermometer,\r\nwhich is used by the Author. Rules are added, however, in the Appendix,\r\nfor converting the French weights and measures into English, by which\r\nmeans the reader may at any time calculate such quantities as occur,\r\nwhen desirous of comparing Mr Lavoisier's experiments with those of\r\nBritish authors.\r\n\r\nBy an oversight, the first part of the translation went to press without\r\nany distinction being preserved between charcoal and its simple\r\nelementary part, which enters into chemical combinations, especially\r\nwith oxygen or the acidifying principle, forming carbonic acid. This\r\npure element, which exists in great plenty in well made charcoal, is\r\nnamed by Mr Lavoisier _carbone_, and ought to have been so in the\r\ntranslation; but the attentive reader can very easily rectify the\r\nmistake. There is an error in Plate XI. which the engraver copied\r\nstrictly from the original, and which was not discovered until the plate\r\nwas worked off at press, when that part of the Elements which treats of\r\nthe apparatus there represented came to be translated. The two tubes 21.\r\nand 24. by which the gas is conveyed into the bottles of alkaline\r\nsolution 22. 25. should have been made to dip into the liquor, while the\r\nother tubes 23. and 26. which carry off the gas, ought to have been cut\r\noff some way above the surface of the liquor in the bottles.\r\n\r\nA few explanatory notes are added; and indeed, from the perspicuity of\r\nthe Author, very few were found necessary. In a very small number of\r\nplaces, the liberty has been taken of throwing to the bottom of the\r\npage, in notes, some parenthetical expressions, only relative to the\r\nsubject, which, in their original place, tended to confuse the sense.\r\nThese, and the original notes of the Author, are distinguished by the\r\nletter A, and to the few which the Translator has ventured to add, the\r\nletter E is subjoined.\r\n\r\nMr Lavoisier has added, in an Appendix, several very useful Tables for\r\nfacilitating the calculations now necessary in the advanced state of\r\nmodern chemistry, wherein the most scrupulous accuracy is required. It\r\nis proper to give some account of these, and of the reasons for omitting\r\nseveral of them.\r\n\r\nNo. I. of the French Appendix is a Table for converting ounces, gros,\r\nand grains, into the decimal fractions of the French pound; and No. II.\r\nfor reducing these decimal fractions again into the vulgar subdivisions.\r\nNo. III. contains the number of French cubical inches and decimals which\r\ncorrespond to a determinate weight of water.\r\n\r\nThe Translator would most readily have converted these Tables into\r\nEnglish weights and measures; but the necessary calculations must have\r\noccupied a great deal more time than could have been spared in the\r\nperiod limited for publication. They are therefore omitted, as\r\naltogether useless, in their present state, to the British chemist.\r\n\r\nNo. IV. is a Table for converting lines or twelfth parts of the inch,\r\nand twelfth parts of lines, into decimal fractions, chiefly for the\r\npurpose of making the necessary corrections upon the quantities of\r\ngasses according to their barometrical pressure. This can hardly be at\r\nall useful or necessary, as the barometers used in Britain are graduated\r\nin decimal fractions of the inch, but, being referred to by the Author\r\nin the text, it has been retained, and is No. I. of the Appendix to\r\nthis Translation.\r\n\r\nNo. V. Is a Table for converting the observed heights of water within\r\nthe jars used in pneumato-chemical experiments into correspondent\r\nheights of mercury for correcting the volume of gasses. This, in Mr\r\nLavoisier's Work, is expressed for the water in lines, and for the\r\nmercury in decimals of the inch, and consequently, for the reasons given\r\nrespecting the Fourth Table, must have been of no use. The Translator\r\nhas therefore calculated a Table for this correction, in which the water\r\nis expressed in decimals, as well as the mercury. This Table is No. II.\r\nof the English Appendix.\r\n\r\nNo. VI. contains the number of French cubical inches and decimals\r\ncontained in the corresponding ounce-measures used in the experiments of\r\nour celebrated countryman Dr Priestley. This Table, which forms No. III.\r\nof the English Appendix, is retained, with the addition of a column, in\r\nwhich the corresponding English cubical inches and decimals are\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nNo. VII. Is a Table of the weights of a cubical foot and inch, French\r\nmeasure, of the different gasses expressed in French ounces, gros,\r\ngrains, and decimals. This, which forms No. VI. of the English Appendix,\r\nhas been, with considerable labour, calculated into English weight and\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nNo. VIII. Gives the specific gravities of a great number of bodies, with\r\ncolumns, containing the weights of a cubical foot and inch, French\r\nmeasure, of all the substances. The specific gravities of this Table,\r\nwhich is No. VII. of the English Appendix, are retained, but the\r\nadditional columns, as useless to the British philosopher, are omitted;\r\nand to have converted these into English denominations must have\r\nrequired very long and painful calculations.\r\n\r\nRules are subjoined, in the Appendix to this translation, for converting\r\nall the weights and measures used by Mr Lavoisier into corresponding\r\nEnglish denominations; and the Translator is proud to acknowledge his\r\nobligation to the learned Professor of Natural Philosophy in the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh, who kindly supplied him with the necessary\r\ninformation for this purpose. A Table is likewise added, No. IV. of the\r\nEnglish Appendix, for converting the degrees of Reaumeur's scale used by\r\nMr Lavoisier into the corresponding degrees of Fahrenheit, which is\r\nuniversally employed in Britain[1].\r\n\r\nThis Translation is sent into the world with the utmost diffidence,\r\ntempered, however, with this consolation, that, though it must fall\r\ngreatly short of the elegance, or even propriety of language, which\r\nevery writer ought to endeavour to attain, it cannot fail of advancing\r\nthe interests of true chemical science, by disseminating the accurate\r\nmode of analysis adopted by its justly celebrated Author. Should the\r\npublic call for a second edition, every care shall be taken to correct\r\nthe forced imperfections of the present translation, and to improve the\r\nwork by valuable additional matter from other authors of reputation in\r\nthe several subjects treated of.\r\n\r\n     EDINBURGH,     }\r\n     Oct. 23. 1789. }\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The Translator has since been enabled, by the kind assistance of the\r\ngentleman above alluded to, to give Tables, of the same nature with\r\nthose of Mr Lavoisier, for facilitating the calculations of the results\r\nof chemical experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE OF THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I began the following Work, my only object was to extend and\r\nexplain more fully the Memoir which I read at the public meeting of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences in the month of April 1787, on the necessity of\r\nreforming and completing the Nomenclature of Chemistry. While engaged in\r\nthis employment, I perceived, better than I had ever done before, the\r\njustice of the following maxims of the Abbé de Condillac, in his System\r\nof Logic, and some other of his works.\r\n\r\n\"We think only through the medium of words.--Languages are true\r\nanalytical methods.--Algebra, which is adapted to its purpose in every\r\nspecies of expression, in the most simple, most exact, and best manner\r\npossible, is at the same time a language and an analytical method.--The\r\nart of reasoning is nothing more than a language well arranged.\"\r\n\r\nThus, while I thought myself employed only in forming a Nomenclature,\r\nand while I proposed to myself nothing more than to improve the chemical\r\nlanguage, my work transformed itself by degrees, without my being able\r\nto prevent it, into a treatise upon the Elements of Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of separating the nomenclature of a science from the\r\nscience itself, is owing to this, that every branch of physical science\r\nmust consist of three things; the series of facts which are the objects\r\nof the science, the ideas which represent these facts, and the words by\r\nwhich these ideas are expressed. Like three impressions of the same\r\nseal, the word ought to produce the idea, and the idea to be a picture\r\nof the fact. And, as ideas are preserved and communicated by means of\r\nwords, it necessarily follows that we cannot improve the language of\r\nany science without at the same time improving the science itself;\r\nneither can we, on the other hand, improve a science, without improving\r\nthe language or nomenclature which belongs to it. However certain the\r\nfacts of any science may be, and, however just the ideas we may have\r\nformed of these facts, we can only communicate false impressions to\r\nothers, while we want words by which these may be properly expressed.\r\n\r\nTo those who will consider it with attention, the first part of this\r\ntreatise will afford frequent proofs of the truth of the above\r\nobservations. But as, in the conduct of my work, I have been obliged to\r\nobserve an order of arrangement essentially differing from what has been\r\nadopted in any other chemical work yet published, it is proper that I\r\nshould explain the motives which have led me to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is a maxim universally admitted in geometry, and indeed in every\r\nbranch of knowledge, that, in the progress of investigation, we should\r\nproceed from known facts to what is unknown. In early infancy, our ideas\r\nspring from our wants; the sensation of want excites the idea of the\r\nobject by which it is to be gratified. In this manner, from a series of\r\nsensations, observations, and analyses, a successive train of ideas\r\narises, so linked together, that an attentive observer may trace back to\r\na certain point the order and connection of the whole sum of human\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nWhen we begin the study of any science, we are in a situation,\r\nrespecting that science, similar to that of children; and the course by\r\nwhich we have to advance is precisely the same which Nature follows in\r\nthe formation of their ideas. In a child, the idea is merely an effect\r\nproduced by a sensation; and, in the same manner, in commencing the\r\nstudy of a physical science, we ought to form no idea but what is a\r\nnecessary consequence, and immediate effect, of an experiment or\r\nobservation. Besides, he that enters upon the career of science, is in a\r\nless advantageous situation than a child who is acquiring his first\r\nideas. To the child, Nature gives various means of rectifying any\r\nmistakes he may commit respecting the salutary or hurtful qualities of\r\nthe objects which surround him. On every occasion his judgments are\r\ncorrected by experience; want and pain are the necessary consequences\r\narising from false judgment; gratification and pleasure are produced by\r\njudging aright. Under such masters, we cannot fail to become well\r\ninformed; and we soon learn to reason justly, when want and pain are the\r\nnecessary consequences of a contrary conduct.\r\n\r\nIn the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different; the\r\nfalse judgments we form neither affect our existence nor our welfare;\r\nand we are not forced by any physical necessity to correct them.\r\nImagination, on the contrary, which is ever wandering beyond the bounds\r\nof truth, joined to self-love and that self-confidence we are so apt to\r\nindulge, prompt us to draw conclusions which are not immediately derived\r\nfrom facts; so that we become in some measure interested in deceiving\r\nourselves. Hence it is by no means to be wondered, that, in the science\r\nof physics in general, men have often made suppositions, instead of\r\nforming conclusions. These suppositions, handed down from one age to\r\nanother, acquire additional weight from the authorities by which they\r\nare supported, till at last they are received, even by men of genius, as\r\nfundamental truths.\r\n\r\nThe only method of preventing such errors from taking place, and of\r\ncorrecting them when formed, is to restrain and simplify our reasoning\r\nas much as possible. This depends entirely upon ourselves, and the\r\nneglect of it is the only source of our mistakes. We must trust to\r\nnothing but facts: These are presented to us by Nature, and cannot\r\ndeceive. We ought, in every instance, to submit our reasoning to the\r\ntest of experiment, and never to search for truth but by the natural\r\nroad of experiment and observation. Thus mathematicians obtain the\r\nsolution of a problem by the mere arrangement of data, and by reducing\r\ntheir reasoning to such simple steps, to conclusions so very obvious, as\r\nnever to lose sight of the evidence which guides them.\r\n\r\nThoroughly convinced of these truths, I have imposed upon myself, as a\r\nlaw, never to advance but from what is known to what is unknown; never\r\nto form any conclusion which is not an immediate consequence necessarily\r\nflowing from observation and experiment; and always to arrange the\r\nfacts, and the conclusions which are drawn from them, in such an order\r\nas shall render it most easy for beginners in the study of chemistry\r\nthoroughly to understand them. Hence I have been obliged to depart from\r\nthe usual order of courses of lectures and of treatises upon chemistry,\r\nwhich always assume the first principles of the science, as known, when\r\nthe pupil or the reader should never be supposed to know them till they\r\nhave been explained in subsequent lessons. In almost every instance,\r\nthese begin by treating of the elements of matter, and by explaining the\r\ntable of affinities, without considering, that, in so doing, they must\r\nbring the principal phenomena of chemistry into view at the very outset:\r\nThey make use of terms which have not been defined, and suppose the\r\nscience to be understood by the very persons they are only beginning to\r\nteach. It ought likewise to be considered, that very little of chemistry\r\ncan be learned in a first course, which is hardly sufficient to make the\r\nlanguage of the science familiar to the ears, or the apparatus familiar\r\nto the eyes. It is almost impossible to become a chemist in less than\r\nthree or four years of constant application.\r\n\r\nThese inconveniencies are occasioned not so much by the nature of the\r\nsubject, as by the method of teaching it; and, to avoid them, I was\r\nchiefly induced to adopt a new arrangement of chemistry, which appeared\r\nto me more consonant to the order of Nature. I acknowledge, however,\r\nthat in thus endeavouring to avoid difficulties of one kind, I have\r\nfound myself involved in others of a different species, some of which I\r\nhave not been able to remove; but I am persuaded, that such as remain do\r\nnot arise from the nature of the order I have adopted, but are rather\r\nconsequences of the imperfection under which chemistry still labours.\r\nThis science still has many chasms, which interrupt the series of facts,\r\nand often render it extremely difficult to reconcile them with each\r\nother: It has not, like the elements of geometry, the advantage of being\r\na complete science, the parts of which are all closely connected\r\ntogether: Its actual progress, however, is so rapid, and the facts,\r\nunder the modern doctrine, have assumed so happy an arrangement, that we\r\nhave ground to hope, even in our own times, to see it approach near to\r\nthe highest state of perfection of which it is susceptible.\r\n\r\nThe rigorous law from which I have never deviated, of forming no\r\nconclusions which are not fully warranted by experiment, and of never\r\nsupplying the absence of facts, has prevented me from comprehending in\r\nthis work the branch of chemistry which treats of affinities, although\r\nit is perhaps the best calculated of any part of chemistry for being\r\nreduced into a completely systematic body. Messrs Geoffroy, Gellert,\r\nBergman, Scheele, De Morveau, Kirwan, and many others, have collected a\r\nnumber of particular facts upon this subject, which only wait for a\r\nproper arrangement; but the principal data are still wanting, or, at\r\nleast, those we have are either not sufficiently defined, or not\r\nsufficiently proved, to become the foundation upon which to build so\r\nvery important a branch of chemistry. This science of affinities, or\r\nelective attractions, holds the same place with regard to the other\r\nbranches of chemistry, as the higher or transcendental geometry does\r\nwith respect to the simpler and elementary part; and I thought it\r\nimproper to involve those simple and plain elements, which I flatter\r\nmyself the greatest part of my readers will easily understand, in the\r\nobscurities and difficulties which still attend that other very useful\r\nand necessary branch of chemical science.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a sentiment of self-love may, without my perceiving it, have\r\ngiven additional force to these reflections. Mr de Morveau is at\r\npresent engaged in publishing the article _Affinity_ in the Methodical\r\nEncyclopædia; and I had more reasons than one to decline entering upon a\r\nwork in which he is employed.\r\n\r\nIt will, no doubt, be a matter of surprise, that in a treatise upon the\r\nelements of chemistry, there should be no chapter on the constituent and\r\nelementary parts of matter; but I shall take occasion, in this place, to\r\nremark, that the fondness for reducing all the bodies in nature to three\r\nor four elements, proceeds from a prejudice which has descended to us\r\nfrom the Greek Philosophers. The notion of four elements, which, by the\r\nvariety of their proportions, compose all the known substances in\r\nnature, is a mere hypothesis, assumed long before the first principles\r\nof experimental philosophy or of chemistry had any existence. In those\r\ndays, without possessing facts, they framed systems; while we, who have\r\ncollected facts, seem determined to reject them, when they do not agree\r\nwith our prejudices. The authority of these fathers of human philosophy\r\nstill carry great weight, and there is reason to fear that it will even\r\nbear hard upon generations yet to come.\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable, that, notwithstanding of the number of\r\nphilosophical chemists who have supported the doctrine of the four\r\nelements, there is not one who has not been led by the evidence of facts\r\nto admit a greater number of elements into their theory. The first\r\nchemists that wrote after the revival of letters, considered sulphur and\r\nsalt as elementary substances entering into the composition of a great\r\nnumber of substances; hence, instead of four, they admitted the\r\nexistence of six elements. Beccher assumes the existence of three kinds\r\nof earth, from the combination of which, in different proportions, he\r\nsupposed all the varieties of metallic substances to be produced. Stahl\r\ngave a new modification to this system; and succeeding chemists have\r\ntaken the liberty to make or to imagine changes and additions of a\r\nsimilar nature. All these chemists were carried along by the influence\r\nof the genius of the age in which they lived, which contented itself\r\nwith assertions without proofs; or, at least, often admitted as proofs\r\nthe slighted degrees of probability, unsupported by that strictly\r\nrigorous analysis required by modern philosophy.\r\n\r\nAll that can be said upon the number and nature of elements is, in my\r\nopinion, confined to discussions entirely of a metaphysical nature. The\r\nsubject only furnishes us with indefinite problems, which may be solved\r\nin a thousand different ways, not one of which, in all probability, is\r\nconsistent with nature. I shall therefore only add upon this subject,\r\nthat if, by the term _elements_, we mean to express those simple and\r\nindivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable\r\nwe know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term _elements_,\r\nor _principles of bodies_, to express our idea of the last point which\r\nanalysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all the\r\nsubstances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by\r\ndecomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances\r\nwe consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater\r\nnumber of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated,\r\nor rather since we have not hitherto discovered the means of separating\r\nthem, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought\r\nnever to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has\r\nproved them to be so.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing reflections upon the progress of chemical ideas naturally\r\napply to the words by which these ideas are to be expressed. Guided by\r\nthe work which, in the year 1787, Messrs de Morveau, Berthollet, de\r\nFourcroy, and I composed upon the Nomenclature of Chemistry, I have\r\nendeavoured, as much as possible, to denominate simple bodies by simple\r\nterms, and I was naturally led to name these first. It will be\r\nrecollected, that we were obliged to retain that name of any substance\r\nby which it had been long known in the world, and that in two cases only\r\nwe took the liberty of making alterations; first, in the case of those\r\nwhich were but newly discovered, and had not yet obtained names, or at\r\nleast which had been known but for a short time, and the names of which\r\nhad not yet received the sanction of the public; and, secondly, when the\r\nnames which had been adopted, whether by the ancients or the moderns,\r\nappeared to us to express evidently false ideas, when they confounded\r\nthe substances, to which they were applied, with others possessed of\r\ndifferent, or perhaps opposite qualities. We made no scruple, in this\r\ncase, of substituting other names in their room, and the greatest number\r\nof these were borrowed from the Greek language. We endeavoured to frame\r\nthem in such a manner as to express the most general and the most\r\ncharacteristic quality of the substances; and this was attended with the\r\nadditional advantage both of assisting the memory of beginners, who find\r\nit difficult to remember a new word which has no meaning, and of\r\naccustoming them early to admit no word without connecting with it some\r\ndeterminate idea.\r\n\r\nTo those bodies which are formed by the union of several simple\r\nsubstances we gave new names, compounded in such a manner as the nature\r\nof the substances directed; but, as the number of double combinations is\r\nalready very considerable, the only method by which we could avoid\r\nconfusion, was to divide them into classes. In the natural order of\r\nideas, the name of the class or genus is that which expresses a quality\r\ncommon to a great number of individuals: The name of the species, on the\r\ncontrary, expresses a quality peculiar to certain individuals only.\r\n\r\nThese distinctions are not, as some may imagine, merely metaphysical,\r\nbut are established by Nature. \"A child,\" says the Abbé de Condillac,\r\n\"is taught to give the name _tree_ to the first one which is pointed out\r\nto him. The next one he sees presents the same idea, and he gives it the\r\nsame name. This he does likewise to a third and a fourth, till at last\r\nthe word _tree_, which he first applied to an individual, comes to be\r\nemployed by him as the name of a class or a genus, an abstract idea,\r\nwhich comprehends all trees in general. But, when he learns that all\r\ntrees serve not the same purpose, that they do not all produce the same\r\nkind of fruit, he will soon learn to distinguish them by specific and\r\nparticular names.\" This is the logic of all the sciences, and is\r\nnaturally applied to chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe acids, for example, are compounded of two substances, of the order\r\nof those which we consider as simple; the one constitutes acidity, and\r\nis common to all acids, and, from this substance, the name of the class\r\nor the genus ought to be taken; the other is peculiar to each acid, and\r\ndistinguishes it from the rest, and from this substance is to be taken\r\nthe name of the species. But, in the greatest number of acids, the two\r\nconstituent elements, the acidifying principle, and that which it\r\nacidifies, may exist in different proportions, constituting all the\r\npossible points of equilibrium or of saturation. This is the case in the\r\nsulphuric and the sulphurous acids; and these two states of the same\r\nacid we have marked by varying the termination of the specific name.\r\n\r\nMetallic substances which have been exposed to the joint action of the\r\nair and of fire, lose their metallic lustre, increase in weight, and\r\nassume an earthy appearance. In this state, like the acids, they are\r\ncompounded of a principle which is common to all, and one which is\r\npeculiar to each. In the same way, therefore, we have thought proper to\r\nclass them under a generic name, derived from the common principle; for\r\nwhich purpose, we adopted the term _oxyd_; and we distinguish them from\r\neach other by the particular name of the metal to which each belongs.\r\n\r\nCombustible substances, which in acids and metallic oxyds are a specific\r\nand particular principle, are capable of becoming, in their turn, common\r\nprinciples of a great number of substances. The sulphurous combinations\r\nhave been long the only known ones in this kind. Now, however, we know,\r\nfrom the experiments of Messrs Vandermonde, Monge, and Berthollet, that\r\ncharcoal may be combined with iron, and perhaps with several other\r\nmetals; and that, from this combination, according to the proportions,\r\nmay be produced steel, plumbago, &c. We know likewise, from the\r\nexperiments of M. Pelletier, that phosphorus may be combined with a\r\ngreat number of metallic substances. These different combinations we\r\nhave classed under generic names taken from the common substance, with a\r\ntermination which marks this analogy, specifying them by another name\r\ntaken from that substance which is proper to each.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature of bodies compounded of three simple substances was\r\nattended with still greater difficulty, not only on account of their\r\nnumber, but, particularly, because we cannot express the nature of their\r\nconstituent principles without employing more compound names. In the\r\nbodies which form this class, such as the neutral salts, for instance,\r\nwe had to consider, 1st, The acidifying principle, which is common to\r\nthem all; 2d, The acidifiable principle which constitutes their peculiar\r\nacid; 3d, The saline, earthy, or metallic basis, which determines the\r\nparticular species of salt. Here we derived the name of each class of\r\nsalts from the name of the acidifiable principle common to all the\r\nindividuals of that class; and distinguished each species by the name of\r\nthe saline, earthy, or metallic basis, which is peculiar to it.\r\n\r\nA salt, though compounded of the same three principles, may,\r\nnevertheless, by the mere difference of their proportion, be in three\r\ndifferent states. The nomenclature we have adopted would have been\r\ndefective, had it not expressed these different states; and this we\r\nattained chiefly by changes of termination uniformly applied to the same\r\nstate of the different salts.\r\n\r\nIn short, we have advanced so far, that from the name alone may be\r\ninstantly found what the combustible substance is which enters into any\r\ncombination; whether that combustible substance be combined with the\r\nacidifying principle, and in what proportion; what is the state of the\r\nacid; with what basis it is united; whether the saturation be exact, or\r\nwhether the acid or the basis be in excess.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily supposed that it was not possible to attain all these\r\ndifferent objects without departing, in some instances, from established\r\ncustom, and adopting terms which at first sight will appear uncouth and\r\nbarbarous. But we considered that the ear is soon habituated to new\r\nwords, especially when they are connected with a general and rational\r\nsystem. The names, besides, which were formerly employed, such as\r\n_powder of algaroth_, _salt of alembroth_, _pompholix_, _phagadenic\r\nwater_, _turbith mineral_, _colcathar_, and many others, were neither\r\nless barbarous nor less uncommon. It required a great deal of practice,\r\nand no small degree of memory, to recollect the substances to which they\r\nwere applied, much more to recollect the genus of combination to which\r\nthey belonged. The names of _oil of tartar per deliquium_, _oil of\r\nvitriol_, _butter of arsenic and of antimony_, _flowers of zinc_, &c.\r\nwere still more improper, because they suggested false ideas: For, in\r\nthe whole mineral kingdom, and particularly in the metallic class, there\r\nexists no such thing as butters, oils, or flowers; and, in short, the\r\nsubstances to which they give these fallacious names, are nothing less\r\nthan rank poisons.\r\n\r\nWhen we published our essay on the nomenclature of chemistry, we were\r\nreproached for having changed the language which was spoken by our\r\nmasters, which they distinguished by their authority, and handed down to\r\nus. But those who reproach us on this account, have forgotten that it\r\nwas Bergman and Macquer themselves who urged us to make this\r\nreformation. In a letter which the learned Professor of Upsal, M.\r\nBergman, wrote, a short time before he died, to M. de Morveau, he bids\r\nhim _spare no improper names; those who are learned, will always be\r\nlearned, and those who are ignorant will thus learn sooner_.\r\n\r\nThere is an objection to the work which I am going to present to the\r\npublic, which is perhaps better founded, that I have given no account of\r\nthe opinion of those who have gone before me; that I have stated only my\r\nown opinion, without examining that of others. By this I have been\r\nprevented from doing that justice to my associates, and more especially\r\nto foreign chemists, which I wished to render them. But I beseech the\r\nreader to consider, that, if I had filled an elementary work with a\r\nmultitude of quotations; if I had allowed myself to enter into long\r\ndissertations on the history of the science, and the works of those who\r\nhave studied it, I must have lost sight of the true object I had in\r\nview, and produced a work, the reading of which must have been extremely\r\ntiresome to beginners. It is not to the history of the science, or of\r\nthe human mind, that we are to attend in an elementary treatise: Our\r\nonly aim ought to be ease and perspicuity, and with the utmost care to\r\nkeep every thing out of view which might draw aside the attention of the\r\nstudent; it is a road which we should be continually rendering more\r\nsmooth, and from which we should endeavour to remove every obstacle\r\nwhich can occasion delay. The sciences, from their own nature, present a\r\nsufficient number of difficulties, though we add not those which are\r\nforeign to them. But, besides this, chemists will easily perceive, that,\r\nin the first part of my work, I make very little use of any experiments\r\nbut those which were made by myself: If at any time I have adopted,\r\nwithout acknowledgment, the experiments or the opinions of M.\r\nBerthollet, M. Fourcroy, M. de la Place, M. Monge, or, in general, of\r\nany of those whose principles are the same with my own, it is owing to\r\nthis circumstance, that frequent intercourse, and the habit of\r\ncommunicating our ideas, our observations, and our way of thinking to\r\neach other, has established between us a sort of community of opinions,\r\nin which it is often difficult for every one to know his own.\r\n\r\nThe remarks I have made on the order which I thought myself obliged to\r\nfollow in the arrangement of proofs and ideas, are to be applied only to\r\nthe first part of this work. It is the only one which contains the\r\ngeneral sum of the doctrine I have adopted, and to which I wished to\r\ngive a form completely elementary.\r\n\r\nThe second part is composed chiefly of tables of the nomenclature of the\r\nneutral salts. To these I have only added general explanations, the\r\nobject of which was to point out the most simple processes for obtaining\r\nthe different kinds of known acids. This part contains nothing which I\r\ncan call my own, and presents only a very short abridgment of the\r\nresults of these processes, extracted from the works of different\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nIn the third part, I have given a description, in detail, of all the\r\noperations connected with modern chemistry. I have long thought that a\r\nwork of this kind was much wanted, and I am convinced it will not be\r\nwithout use. The method of performing experiments, and particularly\r\nthose of modern chemistry, is not so generally known as it ought to be;\r\nand had I, in the different memoirs which I have presented to the\r\nAcademy, been more particular in the detail of the manipulations of my\r\nexperiments, it is probable I should have made myself better understood,\r\nand the science might have made a more rapid progress. The order of the\r\ndifferent matters contained in this third part appeared to me to be\r\nalmost arbitrary; and the only one I have observed was to class\r\ntogether, in each of the chapters of which it is composed, those\r\noperations which are most connected with one another. I need hardly\r\nmention that this part could not be borrowed from any other work, and\r\nthat, in the principal articles it contains, I could not derive\r\nassistance from any thing but the experiments which I have made myself.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this preface by transcribing, literally, some\r\nobservations of the Abbé de Condillac, which I think describe, with a\r\ngood deal of truth, the state of chemistry at a period not far distant\r\nfrom our own. These observations were made on a different subject; but\r\nthey will not, on this account, have less force, if the application of\r\nthem be thought just.\r\n\r\n'Instead of applying observation to the things we wished to know, we\r\nhave chosen rather to imagine them. Advancing from one ill founded\r\nsupposition to another, we have at last bewildered ourselves amidst a\r\nmultitude of errors. These errors becoming prejudices, are, of course,\r\nadopted as principles, and we thus bewilder ourselves more and more. The\r\nmethod, too, by which we conduct our reasonings is as absurd; we abuse\r\nwords which we do not understand, and call this the art of reasoning.\r\nWhen matters have been brought this length, when errors have been thus\r\naccumulated, there is but one remedy by which order can be restored to\r\nthe faculty of thinking; this is, to forget all that we have learned, to\r\ntrace back our ideas to their source, to follow the train in which they\r\nrise, and, as my Lord Bacon says, to frame the human understanding anew.\r\n\r\n'This remedy becomes the more difficult in proportion as we think\r\nourselves more learned. Might it not be thought that works which\r\ntreated of the sciences with the utmost perspicuity, with great\r\nprecision and order, must be understood by every body? The fact is,\r\nthose who have never studied any thing will understand them better than\r\nthose who have studied a great deal, and especially than those who have\r\nwritten a great deal.'\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fifth chapter, the Abbé de Condillac adds: 'But, after\r\nall, the sciences have made progress, because philosophers have applied\r\nthemselves with more attention to observe, and have communicated to\r\ntheir language that precision and accuracy which they have employed in\r\ntheir observations: In correcting their language they reason better.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIRST.\r\n\r\nOf the Formation and Decomposition of\r\nAëriform Fluids,--of the Combustion\r\nof Simple Bodies, and the Formation\r\nof Acids,                                                      Page 1\r\n\r\nCHAP.

I.\r\n\r\n_Of the Combinations of Caloric, and the Formation of Elastic Aëriform\r\nFluids._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat every body, whether solid or fluid, is augmented in all its\r\ndimensions by any increase of its sensible heat, was long ago fully\r\nestablished as a physical axiom, or universal proposition, by the\r\ncelebrated Boerhaave. Such facts as have been adduced for controverting\r\nthe generality of this principle offer only fallacious results, or, at\r\nleast, such as are so complicated with foreign circumstances as to\r\nmislead the judgment: But, when we separately consider the effects, so\r\nas to deduce each from the cause to which they separately belong, it is\r\neasy to perceive that the separation of particles by heat is a constant\r\nand general law of nature.\r\n\r\nWhen we have heated a solid body to a certain degree, and have thereby\r\ncaused its particles to separate from each other, if we allow the body\r\nto cool, its particles again approach each other in the same proportion\r\nin which they were separated by the increased temperature; the body\r\nreturns through the same degrees of expansion which it before extended\r\nthrough; and, if it be brought back to the same temperature from which\r\nwe set out at the commencement of the experiment, it recovers exactly\r\nthe same dimensions which it formerly occupied. But, as we are still\r\nvery far from being able to arrive at the degree of absolute cold, or\r\ndeprivation of all heat, being unacquainted with any degree of coldness\r\nwhich we cannot suppose capable of still farther augmentation, it\r\nfollows, that we are still incapable of causing the ultimate particles\r\nof bodies to approach each other as near as is possible; and,\r\nconsequently, that the particles of all bodies do not touch each other\r\nin any state hitherto known, which, tho' a very singular conclusion, is\r\nyet impossible to be denied.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed, that, since the particles of bodies are thus continually\r\nimpelled by heat to separate from each other, they would have no\r\nconnection between themselves; and, of consequence, that there could be\r\nno solidity in nature, unless they were held together by some other\r\npower which tends to unite them, and, so to speak, to chain them\r\ntogether; which power, whatever be its cause, or manner of operation, we\r\nname Attraction.\r\n\r\nThus the particles of all bodies may be considered as subjected to the\r\naction of two opposite powers, the one repulsive, the other attractive,\r\nbetween which they remain in equilibrio. So long as the attractive force\r\nremains stronger, the body must continue in a state of solidity; but if,\r\non the contrary, heat has so far removed these particles from each\r\nother, as to place them beyond the sphere of attraction, they lose the\r\nadhesion they before had with each other, and the body ceases to be\r\nsolid.\r\n\r\nWater gives us a regular and constant example of these facts; whilst\r\nbelow Zero[2] of the French thermometer, or 32° of Fahrenheit, it\r\nremains solid, and is called ice. Above that degree of temperature, its\r\nparticles being no longer held together by reciprocal attraction, it\r\nbecomes liquid; and, when we raise its temperature above 80°, (212°) its\r\nparticles, giving way to the repulsion caused by the heat, assume the\r\nstate of vapour or gas, and the water is changed into an aëriform fluid.\r\n\r\nThe same may be affirmed of all bodies in nature: They are either solid\r\nor liquid, or in the state of elastic aëriform vapour, according to the\r\nproportion which takes place between the attractive force inherent in\r\ntheir particles, and the repulsive power of the heat acting upon these;\r\nor, what amounts to the same thing, in proportion to the degree of heat\r\nto which they are exposed.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to comprehend these phenomena, without admitting them as\r\nthe effects of a real and material substance, or very subtile fluid,\r\nwhich, insinuating itself between the particles of bodies, separates\r\nthem from each other; and, even allowing the existence of this fluid to\r\nbe hypothetical, we shall see in the sequel, that it explains the\r\nphenomena of nature in a very satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nThis substance, whatever it is, being the cause of heat, or, in other\r\nwords, the sensation which we call _warmth_ being caused by the\r\naccumulation of this substance, we cannot, in strict language,\r\ndistinguish it by the term _heat_; because the same name would then very\r\nimproperly express both cause and effect. For this reason, in the memoir\r\nwhich I published in 1777[3], I gave it the names of _igneous fluid_ and\r\n_matter of heat_. And, since that time, in the work[4] published by Mr\r\nde Morveau, Mr Berthollet, Mr de Fourcroy, and myself, upon the\r\nreformation of chemical nomenclature, we thought it necessary to banish\r\nall periphrastic expressions, which both lengthen physical language, and\r\nrender it more tedious and less distinct, and which even frequently does\r\nnot convey sufficiently just ideas of the subject intended. Wherefore,\r\nwe have distinguished the cause of heat, or that exquisitely elastic\r\nfluid which produces it, by the term of _caloric_. Besides, that this\r\nexpression fulfils our object in the system which we have adopted, it\r\npossesses this farther advantage, that it accords with every species of\r\nopinion, since, strictly speaking, we are not obliged to suppose this to\r\nbe a real substance; it being sufficient, as will more clearly appear in\r\nthe sequel of this work, that it be considered as the repulsive cause,\r\nwhatever that may be, which separates the particles of matter from each\r\nother; so that we are still at liberty to investigate its effects in an\r\nabstract and mathematical manner.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge, we are unable to determine\r\nwhether light be a modification of caloric, or if caloric be, on the\r\ncontrary, a modification of light. This, however, is indisputable, that,\r\nin a system where only decided facts are admissible, and where we avoid,\r\nas far as possible, to suppose any thing to be that is not really known\r\nto exist, we ought provisionally to distinguish, by distinct terms, such\r\nthings as are known to produce different effects. We therefore\r\ndistinguish light from caloric; though we do not therefore deny that\r\nthese have certain qualities in common, and that, in certain\r\ncircumstances, they combine with other bodies almost in the same manner,\r\nand produce, in part, the same effects.\r\n\r\nWhat I have already said may suffice to determine the idea affixed to\r\nthe word _caloric_; but there remains a more difficult attempt, which\r\nis, to give a just conception of the manner in which caloric acts upon\r\nother bodies. Since this subtile matter penetrates through the pores of\r\nall known substances; since there are no vessels through which it cannot\r\nescape, and, consequently, as there are none which are capable of\r\nretaining it, we can only come at the knowledge of its properties by\r\neffects which are fleeting, and difficultly ascertainable. It is in\r\nthese things which we neither see nor feel, that it is especially\r\nnecessary to guard against the extravagancy of our imagination, which\r\nforever inclines to step beyond the bounds of truth, and is very\r\ndifficultly restrained within the narrow line of facts.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, that the same body becomes solid, or fluid, or\r\naëriform, according to the quantity of caloric by which it is\r\npenetrated; or, to speak more strictly, according as the repulsive force\r\nexerted by the caloric is equal to, stronger, or weaker, than the\r\nattraction of the particles of the body it acts upon.\r\n\r\nBut, if these two powers only existed, bodies would become liquid at an\r\nindivisible degree of the thermometer, and would almost instantaneously\r\npass from the solid state of aggregation to that of aëriform elasticity.\r\nThus water, for instance, at the very moment when it ceases to be ice,\r\nwould begin to boil, and would be transformed into an aëriform fluid,\r\nhaving its particles scattered indefinitely through the surrounding\r\nspace. That this does not happen, must depend upon the action of some\r\nthird power. The pressure of the atmosphere prevents this separation,\r\nand causes the water to remain in the liquid state till it be raised to\r\n80° of temperature (212°) above zero of the French thermometer, the\r\nquantity of caloric which it receives in the lowest temperature being\r\ninsufficient to overcome the pressure of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhence it appears that, without this atmospheric pressure, we should not\r\nhave any permanent liquid, and should only be able to see bodies in that\r\nstate of existence in the very instant of melting, as the smallest\r\nadditional caloric would instantly separate their particles, and\r\ndissipate them through the surrounding medium. Besides, without this\r\natmospheric pressure, we should not even have any aëriform fluids,\r\nstrictly speaking, because the moment the force of attraction is\r\novercome by the repulsive power of the caloric, the particles would\r\nseparate themselves indefinitely, having nothing to give limits to their\r\nexpansion, unless their own gravity might collect them together, so as\r\nto form an atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSimple reflection upon the most common experiments is sufficient to\r\nevince the truth of these positions. They are more particularly proved\r\nby the following experiment, which I published in the Memoirs of the\r\nFrench Academy for 1777, p. 426.\r\n\r\nHaving filled with sulphuric ether[5] a small narrow glass vessel, A,\r\n(Plate VII. Fig. 17.), standing upon its stalk P, the vessel, which is\r\nfrom twelve to fifteen lines diameter, is to be covered by a wet\r\nbladder, tied round its neck with several turns of strong thread; for\r\ngreater security, fix a second bladder over the first. The vessel should\r\nbe filled in such a manner with the ether, as not to leave the smallest\r\nportion of air between the liquor and the bladder. It is now to be\r\nplaced under the recipient BCD of an air-pump, of which the upper part B\r\nought to be fitted with a leathern lid, through which passes a wire EF,\r\nhaving its point F very sharp; and in the same receiver there ought to\r\nbe placed the barometer GH. The whole being thus disposed, let the\r\nrecipient be exhausted, and then, by pushing down the wire EF, we make a\r\nhole in the bladder. Immediately the ether begins to boil with great\r\nviolence, and is changed into an elastic aëriform fluid, which fills the\r\nreceiver. If the quantity of ether be sufficient to leave a few drops in\r\nthe phial after the evaporation is finished, the elastic fluid produced\r\nwill sustain the mercury in the barometer attached to the air-pump, at\r\neight or ten inches in winter, and from twenty to twenty-five in\r\nsummer[6]. To render this experiment more complete, we may introduce a\r\nsmall thermometer into the phial A, containing the ether, which will\r\ndescend considerably during the evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe only effect produced in this experiment is, the taking away the\r\nweight of the atmosphere, which, in its ordinary state, presses on the\r\nsurface of the ether; and the effects resulting from this removal\r\nevidently prove, that, in the ordinary temperature of the earth, ether\r\nwould always exist in an aëriform state, but for the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, and that the passing of the ether from the liquid to the\r\naëriform state is accompanied by a considerable lessening of heat;\r\nbecause, during the evaporation, a part of the caloric, which was before\r\nin a free state, or at least in equilibrio in the surrounding bodies,\r\ncombines with the ether, and causes it to assume the aëriform state.\r\n\r\nThe same experiment succeeds with all evaporable fluids, such as\r\nalkohol, water, and even mercury; with this difference, that the\r\natmosphere formed in the receiver by alkohol only supports the attached\r\nbarometer about one inch in winter, and about four or five inches in\r\nsummer; that formed by water, in the same situation, raises the mercury\r\nonly a few lines, and that by quicksilver but a few fractions of a line.\r\nThere is therefore less fluid evaporated from alkohol than from ether,\r\nless from water than from alkohol, and still less from mercury than from\r\neither; consequently there is less caloric employed, and less cold\r\nproduced, which quadrates exactly with the results of these experiments.\r\n\r\nAnother species of experiment proves very evidently that the aëriform\r\nstate is a modification of bodies dependent on the degree of\r\ntemperature, and on the pressure which these bodies undergo. In a Memoir\r\nread by Mr de la Place and me to the Academy in 1777, which has not been\r\nprinted, we have shown, that, when ether is subjected to a pressure\r\nequal to twenty-eight inches of the barometer, or about the medium\r\npressure of the atmosphere, it boils at the temperature of about 32°\r\n(104°), or 33° (106.25°), of the thermometer. Mr de Luc, who has made\r\nsimilar experiments with spirit of wine, finds it boils at 67°\r\n(182.75°). And all the world knows that water boils at 80° (212°). Now,\r\nboiling being only the evaporation of a liquid, or the moment of its\r\npassing from the fluid to the aëriform state, it is evident that, if we\r\nkeep ether continually at the temperature of 33° (106.25°), and under\r\nthe common pressure of the atmosphere, we shall have it always in an\r\nelastic aëriform state; and that the same thing will happen with alkohol\r\nwhen above 67° (182.75°), and with water when above 80° (212°); all\r\nwhich are perfectly conformable to the following experiment[7].\r\n\r\nI filled a large vessel ABCD (Plate VII. Fig. 16.) with water, at 35°\r\n(110.75°), or 36° (113°); I suppose the vessel transparent, that we may\r\nsee what takes place in the experiment; and we can easily hold the hands\r\nin water at that temperature without inconvenience. Into it I plunged\r\nsome narrow necked bottles F, G, which were filled with the water, after\r\nwhich they were turned up, so as to rest on their mouths on the bottom\r\nof the vessel. Having next put some ether into a very small matrass,\r\nwith its neck a b c, twice bent as in the Plate, I plunged this\r\nmatrass into the water, so as to have its neck inserted into the mouth\r\nof one of the bottles F. Immediately upon feeling the effects of the\r\nheat communicated to it by the water in the vessel ABCD it began to\r\nboil; and the caloric entering into combination with it, changed it into\r\nelastic aëriform fluid, with which I filled several bottles\r\nsuccessively, F, G, &c.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to enter upon the examination of the nature and\r\nproperties of this aëriform fluid, which is extremely inflammable; but,\r\nconfining myself to the object at present in view, without anticipating\r\ncircumstances, which I am not to suppose the reader to know, I shall\r\nonly observe, that the ether, from this experiment, is almost only\r\ncapable of existing in the aëriform state in our world; for, if the\r\nweight of our atmosphere was only equal to between 20 and 24 inches of\r\nthe barometer, instead of 28 inches, we should never be able to obtain\r\nether in the liquid state, at least in summer; and the formation of\r\nether would consequently be impossible upon mountains of a moderate\r\ndegree of elevation, as it would be converted into gas immediately upon\r\nbeing produced, unless we employed recipients of extraordinary strength,\r\ntogether with refrigeration and compression. And, lastly, the\r\ntemperature of the blood being nearly that at which ether passes from\r\nthe liquid to the aëriform state, it must evaporate in the primae viae,\r\nand consequently it is very probable the medical properties of this\r\nfluid depend chiefly upon its mechanical effect.\r\n\r\nThese experiments succeed better with nitrous ether, because it\r\nevaporates in a lower temperature than sulphuric ether. It is more\r\ndifficult to obtain alkohol in the aëriform state; because, as it\r\nrequires 67° (182.75°) to reduce it to vapour, the water of the bath\r\nmust be almost boiling, and consequently it is impossible to plunge the\r\nhands into it at that temperature.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, if water were used in the foregoing experiment, it\r\nwould be changed into gas, when exposed to a temperature superior to\r\nthat at which it boils. Although thoroughly convinced of this, Mr de la\r\nPlace and myself judged it necessary to confirm it by the following\r\ndirect experiment. We filled a glass jar A, (Plate VII. Fig. 5.) with\r\nmercury, and placed it with its mouth downwards in a dish B, likewise\r\nfilled with mercury, and having introduced about two gross of water into\r\nthe jar, which rose to the top of the mercury at CD; we then plunged the\r\nwhole apparatus into an iron boiler EFGH, full of boiling sea-water of\r\nthe temperature of 85° (123.25°), placed upon the furnace GHIK.\r\nImmediately upon the water over the mercury attaining the temperature of\r\n80° (212°), it began to boil; and, instead of only filling the small\r\nspace ACD, it was converted into an aëriform fluid, which filled the\r\nwhole jar; the mercury even descended below the surface of that in the\r\ndish B; and the jar must have been overturned, if it had not been very\r\nthick and heavy, and fixed to the dish by means of iron-wire.\r\nImmediately after withdrawing the apparatus from the boiler, the vapour\r\nin the jar began to condense, and the mercury rose to its former\r\nstation; but it returned again to the aëriform state a few seconds after\r\nreplacing the apparatus in the boiler.\r\n\r\nWe have thus a certain number of substances, which are convertible into\r\nelastic aëriform fluids by degrees of temperature, not much superior to\r\nthat of our atmosphere. We shall afterwards find that there are several\r\nothers which undergo the same change in similar circumstances, such as\r\nmuriatic or marine acid, ammoniac or volatile alkali, the carbonic acid\r\nor fixed air, the sulphurous acid, &c. All of these are permanently\r\nelastic in or about the mean temperature of the atmosphere, and under\r\nits common pressure.\r\n\r\nAll these facts, which could be easily multiplied if necessary, give me\r\nfull right to assume, as a general principle, that almost every body in\r\nnature is susceptible of three several states of existence, solid,\r\nliquid, and aëriform, and that these three states of existence depend\r\nupon the quantity of caloric combined with the body. Henceforwards I\r\nshall express these elastic aëriform fluids by the generic term _gas_;\r\nand in each species of gas I shall distinguish between the caloric,\r\nwhich in some measure serves the purpose of a solvent, and the\r\nsubstance, which in combination with the caloric, forms the base of the\r\ngas.\r\n\r\nTo these bases of the different gases, which are hitherto but little\r\nknown, we have been obliged to assign names; these I shall point out in\r\nChap. IV. of this work, when I have previously given an account of the\r\nphenomena attendant upon the heating and cooling of bodies, and when I\r\nhave established precise ideas concerning the composition of our\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown, that the particles of every substance in nature\r\nexist in a certain state of equilibrium, between that attraction which\r\ntends to unite and keep the particles together, and the effects of the\r\ncaloric which tends to separate them. Hence the caloric not only\r\nsurrounds the particles of all bodies on every side, but fills up every\r\ninterval which the particles of bodies leave between each other. We may\r\nform an idea of this, by supposing a vessel filled with small spherical\r\nleaden bullets, into which a quantity of fine sand is poured, which,\r\ninsinuating into the intervals between the bullets, will fill up every\r\nvoid. The balls, in this comparison, are to the sand which surrounds\r\nthem exactly in the same situation as the particles of bodies are with\r\nrespect to the caloric; with this difference only, that the balls are\r\nsupposed to touch each other, whereas the particles of bodies are not in\r\ncontact, being retained at a small distance from each other, by the\r\ncaloric.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of spherical balls, we substitute solid bodies of a\r\nhexahedral, octohedral, or any other regular figure, the capacity of the\r\nintervals between them will be lessened, and consequently will no longer\r\ncontain the same quantity of sand. The same thing takes place, with\r\nrespect to natural bodies; the intervals left between their particles\r\nare not of equal capacity, but vary in consequence of the different\r\nfigures and magnitude of their particles, and of the distance at which\r\nthese particles are maintained, according to the existing proportion\r\nbetween their inherent attraction, and the repulsive force exerted upon\r\nthem by the caloric.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we must understand the following expression, introduced\r\nby the English philosophers, who have given us the first precise ideas\r\nupon this subject; _the capacity of bodies for containing the matter of\r\nheat_. As comparisons with sensible objects are of great use in\r\nassisting us to form distinct notions of abstract ideas, we shall\r\nendeavour to illustrate this, by instancing the phenomena which take\r\nplace between water and bodies which are wetted and penetrated by it,\r\nwith a few reflections.\r\n\r\nIf we immerge equal pieces of different kinds of wood, suppose cubes of\r\none foot each, into water, the fluid gradually insinuates itself into\r\ntheir pores, and the pieces of wood are augmented both in weight and\r\nmagnitude: But each species of wood will imbibe a different quantity of\r\nwater; the lighter and more porous woods will admit a larger, the\r\ncompact and closer grained will admit of a lesser quantity; for the\r\nproportional quantities of water imbibed by the pieces will depend upon\r\nthe nature of the constituent particles of the wood, and upon the\r\ngreater or lesser affinity subsisting between them and water. Very\r\nresinous wood, for instance, though it may be at the same time very\r\nporous, will admit but little water. We may therefore say, that the\r\ndifferent kinds of wood possess different capacities for receiving\r\nwater; we may even determine, by means of the augmentation of their\r\nweights, what quantity of water they have actually absorbed; but, as we\r\nare ignorant how much water they contained, previous to immersion, we\r\ncannot determine the absolute quantity they contain, after being taken\r\nout of the water.\r\n\r\nThe same circumstances undoubtedly take place, with bodies that are\r\nimmersed in caloric; taking into consideration, however, that water is\r\nan incompressible fluid, whereas caloric is, on the contrary, endowed\r\nwith very great elasticity; or, in other words, the particles of caloric\r\nhave a great tendency to separate from each other, when forced by any\r\nother power to approach; this difference must of necessity occasion\r\nvery considerable diversities in the results of experiments made upon\r\nthese two substances.\r\n\r\nHaving established these clear and simple propositions, it will be very\r\neasy to explain the ideas which ought to be affixed to the following\r\nexpressions, which are by no means synonimous, but possess each a strict\r\nand determinate meaning, as in the following definitions:\r\n\r\n_Free caloric_, is that which is not combined in any manner with any\r\nother body. But, as we live in a system to which caloric has a very\r\nstrong adhesion, it follows that we are never able to obtain it in the\r\nstate of absolute freedom.\r\n\r\n_Combined caloric_, is that which is fixed in bodies by affinity or\r\nelective attraction, so as to form part of the substance of the body,\r\neven part of its solidity.\r\n\r\nBy the expression _specific caloric_ of bodies, we understand the\r\nrespective quantities of caloric requisite for raising a number of\r\nbodies of the same weight to an equal degree of temperature. This\r\nproportional quantity of caloric depends upon the distance between the\r\nconstituent particles of bodies, and their greater or lesser degrees of\r\ncohesion; and this distance, or rather the space or void resulting from\r\nit, is, as I have already observed, called the _capacity of bodies for\r\ncontaining caloric_.\r\n\r\n_Heat_, considered as a sensation, or, in other words, sensible heat, is\r\nonly the effect produced upon our sentient organs, by the motion or\r\npassage of caloric, disengaged from the surrounding bodies. In general,\r\nwe receive impressions only in consequence of motion, and we might\r\nestablish it as an axiom, _That_, WITHOUT MOTION, THERE IS NO SENSATION.\r\nThis general principle applies very accurately to the sensations of heat\r\nand cold: When we touch a cold body, the caloric which always tends to\r\nbecome in equilibrio in all bodies, passes from our hand into the body\r\nwe touch, which gives us the feeling or sensation of cold. The direct\r\ncontrary happens, when we touch a warm body, the caloric then passing\r\nfrom the body into our hand, produces the sensation of heat. If the hand\r\nand the body touched be of the same temperature, or very nearly so, we\r\nreceive no impression, either of heat or cold, because there is no\r\nmotion or passage of caloric; and thus no sensation can take place,\r\nwithout some correspondent motion to occasion it.\r\n\r\nWhen the thermometer rises, it shows, that free caloric is entering into\r\nthe surrounding bodies: The thermometer, which is one of these, receives\r\nits share in proportion to its mass, and to the capacity which it\r\npossesses for containing caloric. The change therefore which takes place\r\nupon the thermometer, only announces a change of place of the caloric\r\nin those bodies, of which the thermometer forms one part; it only\r\nindicates the portion of caloric received, without being a measure of\r\nthe whole quantity disengaged, displaced, or absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe most simple and most exact method for determining this latter point,\r\nis that described by Mr de la Place, in the Memoirs of the Academy, No.\r\n1780, p. 364; a summary explanation of which will be found towards the\r\nconclusion of this work. This method consists in placing a body, or a\r\ncombination of bodies, from which caloric is disengaging, in the midst\r\nof a hollow sphere of ice; and the quantity of ice melted becomes an\r\nexact measure of the quantity of caloric disengaged. It is possible, by\r\nmeans of the apparatus which we have caused to be constructed upon this\r\nplan, to determine, not as has been pretended, the capacity of bodies\r\nfor containing heat, but the ratio of the increase or diminution of\r\ncapacity produced by determinate degrees of temperature. It is easy with\r\nthe same apparatus, by means of divers combinations of experiments, to\r\ndetermine the quantity of caloric requisite for converting solid\r\nsubstances into liquids, and liquids into elastic aëriform fluids; and,\r\n_vice versa_, what quantity of caloric escapes from elastic vapours in\r\nchanging to liquids, and what quantity escapes from liquids during their\r\nconversion into solids. Perhaps, when experiments have been made with\r\nsufficient accuracy, we may one day be able to determine the\r\nproportional quantity of caloric, necessary for producing the several\r\nspecies of gasses. I shall hereafter, in a separate chapter, give an\r\naccount of the principal results of such experiments as have been made\r\nupon this head.\r\n\r\nIt remains, before finishing this article, to say a few words relative\r\nto the cause of the elasticity of gasses, and of fluids in the state of\r\nvapour. It is by no means difficult to perceive that this elasticity\r\ndepends upon that of caloric, which seems to be the most eminently\r\nelastic body in nature. Nothing is more readily conceived, than that one\r\nbody should become elastic by entering into combination with another\r\nbody possessed of that quality. We must allow that this is only an\r\nexplanation of elasticity, by an assumption of elasticity, and that we\r\nthus only remove the difficulty one step farther, and that the nature of\r\nelasticity, and the reason for caloric being elastic, remains still\r\nunexplained. Elasticity in the abstract is nothing more than that\r\nquality of the particles of bodies by which they recede from each other\r\nwhen forced together. This tendency in the particles of caloric to\r\nseparate, takes place even at considerable distances. We shall be\r\nsatisfied of this, when we consider that air is susceptible of\r\nundergoing great compression, which supposes that its particles were\r\npreviously very distant from each other; for the power of approaching\r\ntogether certainly supposes a previous distance, at least equal to the\r\ndegree of approach. Consequently, those particles of the air, which are\r\nalready considerably distant from each other, tend to separate still\r\nfarther. In fact, if we produce Boyle's vacuum in a large receiver, the\r\nvery last portion of air which remains spreads itself uniformly through\r\nthe whole capacity of the vessel, however large, fills it completely\r\nthroughout, and presses every where against its sides: We cannot,\r\nhowever, explain this effect, without supposing that the particles make\r\nan effort to separate themselves on every side, and we are quite\r\nignorant at what distance, or what degree of rarefaction, this effort\r\nceases to act.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, exists a true repulsion between the particles of\r\nelastic fluids; at least, circumstances take place exactly as if such a\r\nrepulsion actually existed; and we have very good right to conclude,\r\nthat the particles of caloric mutually repel each other. When we are\r\nonce permitted to suppose this repelling force, the _rationale_ of the\r\nformation of gasses, or aëriform fluids, becomes perfectly simple; tho'\r\nwe must, at the same time, allow, that it is extremely difficult to form\r\nan accurate conception of this repulsive force acting upon very minute\r\nparticles placed at great distances from each other.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, more natural to suppose, that the particles of caloric\r\nhave a stronger mutual attraction than those of any other substance, and\r\nthat these latter particles are forced asunder in consequence of this\r\nsuperior attraction between the particles of the caloric, which forces\r\nthem between the particles of other bodies, that they may be able to\r\nreunite with each other. We have somewhat analogous to this idea in the\r\nphenomena which occur when a dry sponge is dipt into water: The sponge\r\nswells; its particles separate from each other; and all its intervals\r\nare filled up by the water. It is evident, that the sponge, in the act\r\nof swelling, has acquired a greater capacity for containing water than\r\nit had when dry. But we cannot certainly maintain, that the introduction\r\nof water between the particles of the sponge has endowed them with a\r\nrepulsive power, which tends to separate them from each other; on the\r\ncontrary, the whole phenomena are produced by means of attractive\r\npowers; and these are, _first_, The gravity of the water, and the power\r\nwhich it exerts on every side, in common with all other fluids; _2dly_,\r\nThe force of attraction which takes place between the particles of the\r\nwater, causing them to unite together; _3dly_, The mutual attraction of\r\nthe particles of the sponge with each other; and, _lastly_, The\r\nreciprocal attraction which exists between the particles of the sponge\r\nand those of the water. It is easy to understand, that the explanation\r\nof this fact depends upon properly appreciating the intensity of, and\r\nconnection between, these several powers. It is probable, that the\r\nseparation of the particles of bodies, occasioned by caloric, depends in\r\na similar manner upon a certain combination of different attractive\r\npowers, which, in conformity with the imperfection of our knowledge, we\r\nendeavour to express by saying, that caloric communicates a power of\r\nrepulsion to the particles of bodies.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Whenever the degree of heat occurs in this work, it is stated by the\r\nauthor according to Reaumur's scale.

II.\r\n\r\n_General Views relative to the Formation and Composition of our\r\nAtmosphere._\r\n\r\n\r\nThese views which I have taken of the formation of elastic aëriform\r\nfluids or gasses, throw great light upon the original formation of the\r\natmospheres of the planets, and particularly that of our earth. We\r\nreadily conceive, that it must necessarily consist of a mixture of the\r\nfollowing substances: _First_, Of all bodies that are susceptible of\r\nevaporation, or, more strictly speaking, which are capable of retaining\r\nthe state of aëriform elasticity in the temperature of our atmosphere,\r\nand under a pressure equal to that of a column of twenty-eight inches of\r\nquicksilver in the barometer; and, _secondly_, Of all substances,\r\nwhether liquid or solid, which are capable of being dissolved by this\r\nmixture of different gasses.\r\n\r\nThe better to determine our ideas relating to this subject, which has\r\nnot hitherto been sufficiently considered, let us, for a moment,\r\nconceive what change would take place in the various substances which\r\ncompose our earth, if its temperature were suddenly altered. If, for\r\ninstance, we were suddenly transported into the region of the planet\r\nMercury, where probably the common temperature is much superior to that\r\nof boiling water, the water of the earth, and all the other fluids which\r\nare susceptible of the gasseous state, at a temperature near to that of\r\nboiling water, even quicksilver itself, would become rarified; and all\r\nthese substances would be changed into permanent aëriform fluids or\r\ngasses, which would become part of the new atmosphere. These new species\r\nof airs or gasses would mix with those already existing, and certain\r\nreciprocal decompositions and new combinations would take place, until\r\nsuch time as all the elective attractions or affinities subsisting\r\namongst all these new and old gasseous substances had operated fully;\r\nafter which, the elementary principles composing these gasses, being\r\nsaturated, would remain at rest. We must attend to this, however, that,\r\neven in the above hypothetical situation, certain bounds would occur to\r\nthe evaporation of these substances, produced by that very evaporation\r\nitself; for as, in proportion to the increase of elastic fluids, the\r\npressure of the atmosphere would be augmented, as every degree of\r\npressure tends, in some measure, to prevent evaporation, and as even the\r\nmost evaporable fluids can resist the operation of a very high\r\ntemperature without evaporating, if prevented by a proportionally\r\nstronger compression, water and all other liquids being able to sustain\r\na red heat in Papin's digester; we must admit, that the new atmosphere\r\nwould at last arrive at such a degree of weight, that the water which\r\nhad not hitherto evaporated would cease to boil, and, of consequence,\r\nwould remain liquid; so that, even upon this supposition, as in all\r\nothers of the same nature, the increasing gravity of the atmosphere\r\nwould find certain limits which it could not exceed. We might even\r\nextend these reflections greatly farther, and examine what change might\r\nbe produced in such situations upon stones, salts, and the greater part\r\nof the fusible substances which compose the mass of our earth. These\r\nwould be softened, fused, and changed into fluids, &c.: But these\r\nspeculations carry me from my object, to which I hasten to return.\r\n\r\nBy a contrary supposition to the one we have been forming, if the earth\r\nwere suddenly transported into a very cold region, the water which at\r\npresent composes our seas, rivers, and springs, and probably the greater\r\nnumber of the fluids we are acquainted with, would be converted into\r\nsolid mountains and hard rocks, at first diaphanous and homogeneous,\r\nlike rock crystal, but which, in time, becoming mixed with foreign and\r\nheterogeneous substances, would become opake stones of various colours.\r\nIn this case, the air, or at least some part of the aëriform fluids\r\nwhich now compose the mass of our atmosphere, would doubtless lose its\r\nelasticity for want of a sufficient temperature to retain them in that\r\nstate: They would return to the liquid state of existence, and new\r\nliquids would be formed, of whose properties we cannot, at present, form\r\nthe most distant idea.\r\n\r\nThese two opposite suppositions give a distinct proof of the following\r\ncorollaries: _First_, That _solidity_, _liquidity_, and _aëriform\r\nelasticity_, are only three different states of existence of the same\r\nmatter, or three particular modifications which almost all substances\r\nare susceptible of assuming successively, and which solely depend upon\r\nthe degree of temperature to which they are exposed; or, in other words,\r\nupon the quantity of caloric with which they are penetrated[8]. _2dly_,\r\nThat it is extremely probable that air is a fluid naturally existing in\r\na state of vapour; or, as we may better express it, that our atmosphere\r\nis a compound of all the fluids which are susceptible of the vaporous\r\nor permanently elastic state, in the usual temperature, and under the\r\ncommon pressure. _3dly_, That it is not impossible we may discover, in\r\nour atmosphere, certain substances naturally very compact, even metals\r\nthemselves; as a metallic substance, for instance, only a little more\r\nvolatile than mercury, might exist in that situation.\r\n\r\nAmongst the fluids with which we are acquainted, some, as water and\r\nalkohol, are susceptible of mixing with each other in all proportions;\r\nwhereas others, on the contrary, as quicksilver, water, and oil, can\r\nonly form a momentary union; and, after being mixed together, separate\r\nand arrange themselves according to their specific gravities. The same\r\nthing ought to, or at least may, take place in the atmosphere. It is\r\npossible, and even extremely probable, that, both at the first creation,\r\nand every day, gasses are formed, which are difficultly miscible with\r\natmospheric air, and are continually separating from it. If these gasses\r\nbe specifically lighter than the general atmospheric mass, they must, of\r\ncourse, gather in the higher regions, and form strata that float upon\r\nthe common air. The phenomena which accompany igneous meteors induce me\r\nto believe, that there exists in the upper parts of our atmosphere a\r\nstratum of inflammable fluid in contact with those strata of air which\r\nproduce the phenomena of the aurora borealis and other fiery meteors.--I\r\nmean hereafter to pursue this subject in a separate treatise.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The degree of pressure which they undergo must be taken into\r\naccount. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Analysis of Atmospheric Air, and its Division into two Elastic Fluids;\r\nthe one fit for Respiration, the other incapable of being respired._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been premised, it follows, that our atmosphere is composed\r\nof a mixture of every substance capable of retaining the gasseous or\r\naëriform state in the common temperature, and under the usual pressure\r\nwhich it experiences. These fluids constitute a mass, in some measure\r\nhomogeneous, extending from the surface of the earth to the greatest\r\nheight hitherto attained, of which the density continually decreases in\r\nthe inverse ratio of the superincumbent weight. But, as I have before\r\nobserved, it is possible that this first stratum is surmounted by\r\nseveral others consisting of very different fluids.\r\n\r\nOur business, in this place, is to endeavour to determine, by\r\nexperiments, the nature of the elastic fluids which compose the inferior\r\nstratum of air which we inhabit. Modern chemistry has made great\r\nadvances in this research; and it will appear by the following details\r\nthat the analysis of atmospherical air has been more rigorously\r\ndetermined than that of any other substance of the class. Chemistry\r\naffords two general methods of determining the constituent principles of\r\nbodies, the method of analysis, and that of synthesis. When, for\r\ninstance, by combining water with alkohol, we form the species of liquor\r\ncalled, in commercial language, brandy or spirit of wine, we certainly\r\nhave a right to conclude, that brandy, or spirit of wine, is composed of\r\nalkohol combined with water. We can produce the same result by the\r\nanalytical method; and in general it ought to be considered as a\r\nprinciple in chemical science, never to rest satisfied without both\r\nthese species of proofs.\r\n\r\nWe have this advantage in the analysis of atmospherical air, being able\r\nboth to decompound it, and to form it a new in the most satisfactory\r\nmanner. I shall, however, at present confine myself to recount such\r\nexperiments as are most conclusive upon this head; and I may consider\r\nmost of these as my own, having either first invented them, or having\r\nrepeated those of others, with the intention of analysing atmospherical\r\nair, in perfectly new points of view.\r\n\r\nI took a matrass (A, fig. 14. plate II.) of about 36 cubical inches\r\ncapacity, having a long neck B C D E, of six or seven lines internal\r\ndiameter, and having bent the neck as in Plate IV. Fig. 2. so as to\r\nallow of its being placed in the furnace M M N N, in such a manner that\r\nthe extremity of its neck E might be inserted under a bell-glass F G,\r\nplaced in a trough of quicksilver R R S S; I introduced four ounces of\r\npure mercury into the matrass, and, by means of a syphon, exhausted the\r\nair in the receiver F G, so as to raise the quicksilver to L L, and I\r\ncarefully marked the height at which it stood by pasting on a slip of\r\npaper. Having accurately noted the height of the thermometer and\r\nbarometer, I lighted a fire in the furnace M M N N, which I kept up\r\nalmost continually during twelve days, so as to keep the quicksilver\r\nalways almost at its boiling point. Nothing remarkable took place during\r\nthe first day: The Mercury, though not boiling, was continually\r\nevaporating, and covered the interior surface of the vessels with small\r\ndrops, at first very minute, which gradually augmenting to a sufficient\r\nsize, fell back into the mass at the bottom of the vessel. On the second\r\nday, small red particles began to appear on the surface of the mercury,\r\nwhich, during the four or five following days, gradually increased in\r\nsize and number; after which they ceased to increase in either respect.\r\nAt the end of twelve days, seeing that the calcination of the mercury\r\ndid not at all increase, I extinguished the fire, and allowed the\r\nvessels to cool. The bulk of air in the body and neck of the matrass,\r\nand in the bell-glass, reduced to a medium of 28 inches of the\r\nbarometer and 10° (54.5°) of the thermometer, at the commencement of the\r\nexperiment was about 50 cubical inches. At the end of the experiment the\r\nremaining air, reduced to the same medium pressure and temperature, was\r\nonly between 42 and 43 cubical inches; consequently it had lost about\r\n1/6 of its bulk. Afterwards, having collected all the red particles,\r\nformed during the experiment, from the running mercury in which they\r\nfloated, I found these to amount to 45 grains.\r\n\r\nI was obliged to repeat this experiment several times, as it is\r\ndifficult in one experiment both to preserve the whole air upon which we\r\noperate, and to collect the whole of the red particles, or calx of\r\nmercury, which is formed during the calcination. It will often happen in\r\nthe sequel, that I shall, in this manner, give in one detail the results\r\nof two or three experiments of the same nature.\r\n\r\nThe air which remained after the calcination of the mercury in this\r\nexperiment, and which was reduced to 5/6 of its former bulk, was no\r\nlonger fit either for respiration or for combustion; animals being\r\nintroduced into it were suffocated in a few seconds, and when a taper\r\nwas plunged into it, it was extinguished as if it had been immersed into\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, I took the 45 grains of red matter formed during this\r\nexperiment, which I put into a small glass retort, having a proper\r\napparatus for receiving such liquid, or gasseous product, as might be\r\nextracted: Having applied a fire to the retort in a furnace, I observed\r\nthat, in proportion as the red matter became heated, the intensity of\r\nits colour augmented. When the retort was almost red hot, the red matter\r\nbegan gradually to decrease in bulk, and in a few minutes after it\r\ndisappeared altogether; at the same time 41-1/2 grains of running\r\nmercury were collected in the recipient, and 7 or 8 cubical inches of\r\nelastic fluid, greatly more capable of supporting both respiration and\r\ncombustion than atmospherical air, were collected in the bell-glass.\r\n\r\nA part of this air being put into a glass tube of about an inch\r\ndiameter, showed the following properties: A taper burned in it with a\r\ndazzling splendour, and charcoal, instead of consuming quietly as it\r\ndoes in common air, burnt with a flame, attended with a decrepitating\r\nnoise, like phosphorus, and threw out such a brilliant light that the\r\neyes could hardly endure it. This species of air was discovered almost\r\nat the same time by Mr Priestley, Mr Scheele, and myself. Mr Priestley\r\ngave it the name of _dephlogisticated air_, Mr Scheele called it\r\n_empyreal air_. At first I named it _highly respirable air_, to which\r\nhas since been substituted the term of _vital air_. We shall presently\r\nsee what we ought to think of these denominations.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting upon the circumstances of this experiment, we readily\r\nperceive, that the mercury, during its calcination, absorbs the\r\nsalubrious and respirable part of the air, or, to speak more strictly,\r\nthe base of this respirable part; that the remaining air is a species of\r\nmephitis, incapable of supporting combustion or respiration; and\r\nconsequently that atmospheric air is composed of two elastic fluids of\r\ndifferent and opposite qualities. As a proof of this important truth, if\r\nwe recombine these two elastic fluids, which we have separately obtained\r\nin the above experiment, viz. the 42 cubical inches of mephitis, with\r\nthe 8 cubical inches of respirable air, we reproduce an air precisely\r\nsimilar to that of the atmosphere, and possessing nearly the same power\r\nof supporting combustion and respiration, and of contributing to the\r\ncalcination of metals.\r\n\r\nAlthough this experiment furnishes us with a very simple means of\r\nobtaining the two principal elastic fluids which compose our atmosphere,\r\nseparate from each other, yet it does not give us an exact idea of the\r\nproportion in which these two enter into its composition: For the\r\nattraction of mercury to the respirable part of the air, or rather to\r\nits base, is not sufficiently strong to overcome all the circumstances\r\nwhich oppose this union. These obstacles are the mutual adhesion of the\r\ntwo constituent parts of the atmosphere for each other, and the elective\r\nattraction which unites the base of vital air with caloric; in\r\nconsequence of these, when the calcination ends, or is at least carried\r\nas far as is possible, in a determinate quantity of atmospheric air,\r\nthere still remains a portion of respirable air united to the mephitis,\r\nwhich the mercury cannot separate. I shall afterwards show, that, at\r\nleast in our climate, the atmospheric air is composed of respirable and\r\nmephitic airs, in the proportion of 27 and 73; and I shall then discuss\r\nthe causes of the uncertainty which still exists with respect to the\r\nexactness of that proportion.\r\n\r\nSince, during the calcination of mercury, air is decomposed, and the\r\nbase of its respirable part is fixed and combined with the mercury, it\r\nfollows, from the principles already established, that caloric and light\r\nmust be disengaged during the process: But the two following causes\r\nprevent us from being sensible of this taking place: As the calcination\r\nlasts during several days, the disengagement of caloric and light,\r\nspread out in a considerable space of time, becomes extremely small for\r\neach particular moment of that time, so as not to be perceptible; and,\r\nin the next place, the operation being carried on by means of fire in a\r\nfurnace, the heat produced by the calcination itself becomes confounded\r\nwith that proceeding from the furnace. I might add the respirable part\r\nof the air, or rather its base, in entering into combination with the\r\nmercury, does not part with all the caloric which it contained, but\r\nstill retains a part of it after forming the new compound; but the\r\ndiscussion of this point, and its proofs from experiment, do not belong\r\nto this part of our subject.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, easy to render this disengagement of caloric and light\r\nevident to the senses, by causing the decomposition of air to take place\r\nin a more rapid manner. And for this purpose, iron is excellently\r\nadapted, as it possesses a much stronger affinity for the base of\r\nrespirable air than mercury. The elegant experiment of Mr Ingenhouz,\r\nupon the combustion of iron, is well known. Take a piece of fine iron\r\nwire, twisted into a spiral, (BC, Plate IV. Fig. 17.) fix one of its\r\nextremities B into the cork A, adapted to the neck of the bottle DEFG,\r\nand fix to the other extremity of the wire C, a small morsel of tinder.\r\nMatters being thus prepared, fill the bottle DEFG with air deprived of\r\nits mephitic part; then light the tinder, and introduce it quickly with\r\nthe wire upon which it is fixed, into the bottle which you stop up with\r\nthe cork A, as is shown in the figure (17 Plate IV.) The instant the\r\ntinder comes into contact with the vital air it begins to burn with\r\ngreat intensity; and, communicating the inflammation to the iron-wire,\r\nit too takes fire, and burns rapidly, throwing out brilliant sparks,\r\nwhich fall to the bottom of the vessel in rounded globules, which become\r\nblack in cooling, but retain a degree of metallic splendour. The iron\r\nthus burnt is more brittle even than glass, and is easily reduced into\r\npowder, and is still attractable by the magnet, though not so powerfully\r\nas it was before combustion. As Mr Ingenhouz has neither examined the\r\nchange produced on iron, nor upon the air by this operation, I have\r\nrepeated the experiment under different circumstances, in an apparatus\r\nadapted to answer my particular views, as follows.\r\n\r\nHaving filled a bell-glass (A, Plate IV. Fig. 3.) of about six pints\r\nmeasure, with pure air, or the highly respirable part of air, I\r\ntransported this jar by means of a very flat vessel, into a quicksilver\r\nbath in the bason BC, and I took care to render the surface of the\r\nmercury perfectly dry both within and without the jar with blotting\r\npaper. I then provided a small capsule of china-ware D, very flat and\r\nopen, in which I placed some small pieces of iron, turned spirally, and\r\narranged in such a way as seemed most favourable for the combustion\r\nbeing communicated to every part. To the end of one of these pieces of\r\niron was fixed a small morsel of tinder, to which was added about the\r\nsixteenth part of a grain of phosphorus, and, by raising the bell-glass\r\na little, the china capsule, with its contents, were introduced into the\r\npure air. I know that, by this means, some common air must mix with the\r\npure air in the glass; but this, when it is done dexterously, is so very\r\ntrifling, as not to injure the success of the experiment. This being\r\ndone, a part of the air is sucked out from the bell-glass, by means of a\r\nsyphon GHI, so as to raise the mercury within the glass to EF; and, to\r\nprevent the mercury from getting into the syphon, a small piece of paper\r\nis twisted round its extremity. In sucking out the air, if the motion of\r\nthe lungs only be used, we cannot make the mercury rise above an inch or\r\nan inch and a half; but, by properly using the muscles of the mouth, we\r\ncan, without difficulty, cause it to rise six or seven inches.\r\n\r\nI next took an iron wire, (MN, Plate IV. Fig. 16.) properly bent for the\r\npurpose, and making it red hot in the fire, passed it through the\r\nmercury into the receiver, and brought it in contact with the small\r\npiece of phosphorus attached to the tinder. The phosphorus instantly\r\ntakes fire, which communicates to the tinder, and from that to the iron.\r\nWhen the pieces have been properly arranged, the whole iron burns, even\r\nto the last particle, throwing out a white brilliant light similar to\r\nthat of Chinese fireworks. The great heat produced by this combustion\r\nmelts the iron into round globules of different sizes, most of which\r\nfall into the China cup; but some are thrown out of it, and swim upon\r\nthe surface of the mercury. At the beginning of the combustion, there is\r\na slight augmentation in the volume of the air in the bell-glass, from\r\nthe dilatation caused by the heat; but, presently afterwards, a rapid\r\ndiminution of the air takes place, and the mercury rises in the glass;\r\ninsomuch that, when the quantity of iron is sufficient, and the air\r\noperated upon is very pure, almost the whole air employed is absorbed.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to remark in this place, that, unless in making experiments\r\nfor the purpose of discovery, it is better to be contented with burning\r\na moderate quantity of iron; for, when this experiment is pushed too\r\nfar, so as to absorb much of the air, the cup D, which floats upon the\r\nquicksilver, approaches too near the bottom of the bell-glass; and the\r\ngreat heat produced, which is followed by a very sudden cooling,\r\noccasioned by the contact of the cold mercury, is apt to break the\r\nglass. In which case, the sudden fall of the column of mercury, which\r\nhappens the moment the least flaw is produced in the glass, causes such\r\na wave, as throws a great part of the quicksilver from the bason. To\r\navoid this inconvenience, and to ensure success to the experiment, one\r\ngross and a half of iron is sufficient to burn in a bell-glass, which\r\nholds about eight pints of air. The glass ought likewise to be strong,\r\nthat it may be able to bear the weight of the column of mercury which it\r\nhas to support.\r\n\r\nBy this experiment, it is not possible to determine, at one time, both\r\nthe additional weight acquired by the iron, and the changes which have\r\ntaken place in the air. If it is wished to ascertain what additional\r\nweight has been gained by the iron, and the proportion between that and\r\nthe air absorbed, we must carefully mark upon the bell-glass, with a\r\ndiamond, the height of the mercury, both before and after the\r\nexperiment[9]. After this, the syphon (GH, Pl. IV. fig. 3.) guarded, as\r\nbefore, with a bit of paper, to prevent its filling with mercury, is to\r\nbe introduced under the bell-glass, having the thumb placed upon the\r\nextremity, G, of the syphon, to regulate the passage of the air; and by\r\nthis means the air is gradually admitted, so as to let the mercury fall\r\nto its level. This being done, the bell-glass is to be carefully\r\nremoved, the globules of melted iron contained in the cup, and those\r\nwhich have been scattered about, and swim upon the mercury, are to be\r\naccurately collected, and the whole is to be weighed. The iron will be\r\nfound in that state called _martial ethiops_ by the old chemists,\r\npossessing a degree of metallic brilliancy, very friable, and readily\r\nreducible into powder, under the hammer, or with a pestle and mortar. If\r\nthe experiment has succeeded well, from 100 grains of iron will be\r\nobtained 135 or 136 grains of ethiops, which is an augmentation of 35\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nIf all the attention has been paid to this experiment which it deserves,\r\nthe air will be found diminished in weight exactly equal to what the\r\niron has gained. Having therefore burnt 100 grains of iron, which has\r\nacquired an additional weight of 35 grains, the diminution of air will\r\nbe found exactly 70 cubical inches; and it will be found, in the sequel,\r\nthat the weight of vital air is pretty nearly half a grain for each\r\ncubical inch; so that, in effect, the augmentation of weight in the one\r\nexactly coincides with the loss of it in the other.\r\n\r\nI shall observe here, once for all, that, in every experiment of this\r\nkind, the pressure and temperature of the air, both before and after the\r\nexperiment, must be reduced, by calculation, to a common standard of 10°\r\n(54.5°) of the thermometer, and 28 inches of the barometer. Towards the\r\nend of this work, the manner of performing this very necessary reduction\r\nwill be found accurately detailed.\r\n\r\nIf it be required to examine the nature of the air which remains after\r\nthis experiment, we must operate in a somewhat different manner. After\r\nthe combustion is finished, and the vessels have cooled, we first take\r\nout the cup, and the burnt iron, by introducing the hand through the\r\nquicksilver, under the bell-glass; we next introduce some solution of\r\npotash, or caustic alkali, or of the sulphuret of potash, or such other\r\nsubstance as is judged proper for examining their action upon the\r\nresiduum of air. I shall, in the sequel, give an account of these\r\nmethods of analysing air, when I have explained the nature of these\r\ndifferent substances, which are only here in a manner accidentally\r\nmentioned. After this examination, so much water must be let into the\r\nglass as will displace the quicksilver, and then, by means of a shallow\r\ndish placed below the bell-glass, it is to be removed into the common\r\nwater pneumato-chemical apparatus, where the air remaining may be\r\nexamined at large, and with great facility.\r\n\r\nWhen very soft and very pure iron has been employed in this experiment,\r\nand, if the combustion has been performed in the purest respirable or\r\nvital air, free from all admixture of the noxious or mephitic part, the\r\nair which remains after the combustion will be found as pure as it was\r\nbefore; but it is difficult to find iron entirely free from a small\r\nportion of charry matter, which is chiefly abundant in steel. It is\r\nlikewise exceedingly difficult to procure the pure air perfectly free\r\nfrom some admixture of mephitis, with which it is almost always\r\ncontaminated; but this species of noxious air does not, in the smallest\r\ndegree, disturb the result of the experiment, as it is always found at\r\nthe end exactly in the same proportion as at the beginning.\r\n\r\nI mentioned before, that we have two ways of determining the constituent\r\nparts of atmospheric air, the method of analysis, and that by synthesis.\r\nThe calcination of mercury has furnished us with an example of each of\r\nthese methods, since, after having robbed the respirable part of its\r\nbase, by means of the mercury, we have restored it, so as to recompose\r\nan air precisely similar to that of the atmosphere. But we can equally\r\naccomplish this synthetic composition of atmospheric air, by borrowing\r\nthe materials of which it is composed from different kingdoms of nature.\r\nWe shall see hereafter that, when animal substances are dissolved in the\r\nnitric acid, a great quantity of gas is disengaged, which extinguishes\r\nlight, and is unfit for animal respiration, being exactly similar to the\r\nnoxious or mephitic part of atmospheric air. And, if we take 73 parts,\r\nby weight, of this elastic fluid, and mix it with 27 parts of highly\r\nrespirable air, procured from calcined mercury, we will form an elastic\r\nfluid precisely similar to atmospheric air in all its properties.\r\n\r\nThere are many other methods of separating the respirable from the\r\nnoxious part of the atmospheric air, which cannot be taken notice of in\r\nthis part, without anticipating information, which properly belongs to\r\nthe subsequent chapters. The experiments already adduced may suffice for\r\nan elementary treatise; and, in matters of this nature, the choice of\r\nour evidences is of far greater consequence than their number.\r\n\r\nI shall close this article, by pointing out the property which\r\natmospheric air, and all the known gasses, possess of dissolving water,\r\nwhich is of great consequence to be attended to in all experiments of\r\nthis nature. Mr Saussure found, by experiment, that a cubical foot of\r\natmospheric air is capable of holding 12 grains of water in solution:\r\nOther gasses, as the carbonic acid, appear capable of dissolving a\r\ngreater quantity; but experiments are still wanting by which to\r\ndetermine their several proportions. This water, held in solution by\r\ngasses, gives rise to particular phenomena in many experiments, which\r\nrequire great attention, and which has frequently proved the source of\r\ngreat errors to chemists in determining the results of their\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] It will likewise be necessary to take care that the air contained in\r\nthe glass, both before and after the experiment, be reduced to a common\r\ntemperature and pressure, otherwise the results of the following\r\ncalculations will be fallacious.--E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n_Nomenclature of the several Constituent Parts of Atmospheric Air._\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto I have been obliged to make use of circumlocution, to express\r\nthe nature of the several substances which constitute our atmosphere,\r\nhaving provisionally used the terms of _respirable_ and _noxious_, or\r\n_non-respirable parts of the air_. But the investigations I mean to\r\nundertake require a more direct mode of expression; and, having now\r\nendeavoured to give simple and distinct ideas of the different\r\nsubstances which enter into the composition of the atmosphere, I shall\r\nhenceforth express these ideas by words equally simple.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of our earth being very near to that at which water\r\nbecomes solid, and reciprocally changes from solid to fluid, and as this\r\nphenomenon takes place frequently under our observation, it has very\r\nnaturally followed, that, in the languages of at least every climate\r\nsubjected to any degree of winter, a term has been used for signifying\r\nwater in the state of solidity, when deprived of its caloric. The same,\r\nhowever, has not been found necessary with respect to water reduced to\r\nthe state of vapour by an additional dose of caloric; since those\r\npersons who do not make a particular study of objects of this kind, are\r\nstill ignorant that water, when in a temperature only a little above the\r\nboiling heat, is changed into an elastic aëriform fluid, susceptible,\r\nlike all other gasses, of being received and contained in vessels, and\r\npreserving its gasseous form so long as it remains at the temperature of\r\n80° (212°), and under a pressure not exceeding 28 inches of the\r\nmercurial barometer. As this phenomenon has not been generally observed,\r\nno language has used a particular term for expressing water in this\r\nstate[10]; and the same thing occurs with all fluids, and all\r\nsubstances, which do not evaporate in the common temperature, and under\r\nthe usual pressure of our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFor similar reasons, names have not been given to the liquid or concrete\r\nstates of most of the aëriform fluids: These were not known to arise\r\nfrom the combination of caloric with certain bases; and, as they had not\r\nbeen seen either in the liquid or solid states, their existence, under\r\nthese forms, was even unknown to natural philosophers.\r\n\r\nWe have not pretended to make any alteration upon such terms as are\r\nsanctified by ancient custom; and, therefore, continue to use the words\r\n_water_ and _ice_ in their common acceptation: We likewise retain the\r\nword _air_, to express that collection of elastic fluids which composes\r\nour atmosphere; but we have not thought it necessary to preserve the\r\nsame respect for modern terms, adopted by latter philosophers, having\r\nconsidered ourselves as at liberty to reject such as appeared liable to\r\noccasion erroneous ideas of the substances they are meant to express,\r\nand either to substitute new terms, or to employ the old ones, after\r\nmodifying them in such a manner as to convey more determinate ideas. New\r\nwords have been drawn, chiefly from the Greek language, in such a manner\r\nas to make their etymology convey some idea of what was meant to be\r\nrepresented; and these we have always endeavoured to make short, and of\r\nsuch a nature as to be changeable into adjectives and verbs.\r\n\r\nFollowing these principles, we have, after Mr Macquer's example,\r\nretained the term _gas_, employed by Vanhelmont, having arranged the\r\nnumerous class of elastic aëriform fluids under that name, excepting\r\nonly atmospheric air. _Gas_, therefore, in our nomenclature, becomes a\r\ngeneric term, expressing the fullest degree of saturation in any body\r\nwith caloric; being, in fact, a term expressive of a mode of existence.\r\nTo distinguish each species of gas, we employ a second term from the\r\nname of the base, which, saturated with caloric, forms each particular\r\ngas. Thus, we name water combined to saturation with caloric, so as to\r\nform an elastic fluid, _aqueous gas_; ether, combined in the same\r\nmanner, _etherial gas_; the combination of alkohol with caloric, becomes\r\n_alkoholic gas_; and, following the same principles, we have _muriatic\r\nacid gas_, _ammoniacal gas_, and so on of every substance susceptible of\r\nbeing combined with caloric, in such a manner as to assume the gasseous\r\nor elastic aëriform state.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, that the atmospheric air is composed of two\r\ngasses, or aëriform fluids, one of which is capable, by respiration, of\r\ncontributing to animal life, and in which metals are calcinable, and\r\ncombustible bodies may burn; the other, on the contrary, is endowed with\r\ndirectly opposite qualities; it cannot be breathed by animals, neither\r\nwill it admit of the combustion of inflammable bodies, nor of the\r\ncalcination of metals. We have given to the base of the former, or\r\nrespirable portion of the air, the name of _oxygen_, from [Greek: oxys]\r\n_acidum_, and [Greek: geinomas], _gignor_; because, in reality, one of\r\nthe most general properties of this base is to form acids, by combining\r\nwith many different substances. The union of this base with caloric we\r\nterm _oxygen gas_, which is the same with what was formerly called\r\n_pure_, or _vital air_. The weight of this gas, at the temperature of\r\n10° (54.50), and under a pressure equal to 28 inches of the barometer,\r\nis half a grain for each cubical inch, or one ounce and a half to each\r\ncubical foot.\r\n\r\nThe chemical properties of the noxious portion of atmospheric air being\r\nhitherto but little known, we have been satisfied to derive the name of\r\nits base from its known quality of killing such animals as are forced to\r\nbreathe it, giving it the name of _azote_, from the Greek privitive\r\nparticle [Greek: a] and [Greek: xaê], vita; hence the name of the\r\nnoxious part of atmospheric air is _azotic gas_; the weight of which, in\r\nthe same temperature, and under the same pressure, is 1 oz. 2 gros\r\nand 48 grs. to the cubical foot, or 0.4444 of a grain to the cubical\r\ninch. We cannot deny that this name appears somewhat extraordinary; but\r\nthis must be the case with all new terms, which cannot be expected to\r\nbecome familiar until they have been some time in use. We long\r\nendeavoured to find a more proper designation without success; it was at\r\nfirst proposed to call it _alkaligen gas_, as, from the experiments of\r\nMr Berthollet, it appears to enter into the composition of ammoniac, or\r\nvolatile alkali; but then, we have as yet no proof of its making one of\r\nthe constituent elements of the other alkalies; beside, it is proved to\r\ncompose a part of the nitric acid, which gives as good reason to have\r\ncalled it _nitrigen_. For these reasons, finding it necessary to reject\r\nany name upon systematic principles, we have considered that we run no\r\nrisk of mistake in adopting the terms of _azote_, and _azotic gas_,\r\nwhich only express a matter of fact, or that property which it\r\npossesses, of depriving such animals as breathe it of their lives.\r\n\r\nI should anticipate subjects more properly reserved for the subsequent\r\nchapters, were I in this place to enter upon the nomenclature of the\r\nseveral species of gasses: It is sufficient, in this part of the work,\r\nto establish the principles upon which their denominations are founded.\r\nThe principal merit of the nomenclature we have adopted is, that, when\r\nonce the simple elementary substance is distinguished by an appropriate\r\nterm, the names of all its compounds derive readily, and necessarily,\r\nfrom this first denomination.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] In English, the word _steam_ is exclusively appropriated to water\r\nin the state of vapour. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of the Decomposition of Oxygen Gas by Sulphur, Phosphorus, and\r\nCharcoal--and of the Formation of Acids in general._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn performing experiments, it is a necessary principle, which ought\r\nnever to be deviated from, that they be simplified as much as possible,\r\nand that every circumstance capable of rendering their results\r\ncomplicated be carefully removed. Wherefore, in the experiments which\r\nform the object of this chapter, we have never employed atmospheric air,\r\nwhich is not a simple substance. It is true, that the azotic gas, which\r\nforms a part of its mixture, appears to be merely passive during\r\ncombustion and calcination; but, besides that it retards these\r\noperations very considerably, we are not certain but it may even alter\r\ntheir results in some circumstances; for which reason, I have thought it\r\nnecessary to remove even this possible cause of doubt, by only making\r\nuse of pure oxygen gas in the following experiments, which show the\r\neffects produced by combustion in that gas; and I shall advert to such\r\ndifferences as take place in the results of these, when the oxygen gas,\r\nor pure vital air, is mixed, in different proportions, with azotic gas.\r\n\r\nHaving filled a bell-glass (A. Pl. iv. fig. 3), of between five and six\r\npints measure, with oxygen gas, I removed it from the water trough,\r\nwhere it was filled, into the quicksilver bath, by means of a shallow\r\nglass dish slipped underneath, and having dried the mercury, I\r\nintroduced 61-1/4 grains of Kunkel's phosphorus in two little China\r\ncups, like that represented at D, fig. 3. under the glass A; and that I\r\nmight set fire to each of the portions of phosphorus separately, and to\r\nprevent the one from catching fire from the other, one of the dishes was\r\ncovered with a piece of flat glass. I next raised the quicksilver in the\r\nbell-glass up to E F, by sucking out a sufficient portion of the gas by\r\nmeans of the syphon G H I. After this, by means of the crooked iron wire\r\n(fig. 16.), made red hot, I set fire to the two portions of phosphorus\r\nsuccessively, first burning that portion which was not covered with the\r\npiece of glass. The combustion was extremely rapid, attended with a very\r\nbrilliant flame, and considerable disengagement of light and heat. In\r\nconsequence of the great heat induced, the gas was at first much\r\ndilated, but soon after the mercury returned to its level, and a\r\nconsiderable absorption of gas took place; at the same time, the whole\r\ninside of the glass became covered with white light flakes of concrete\r\nphosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the experiment, the quantity of oxygen gas, reduced,\r\nas above directed, to a common standard, amounted to 162 cubical inches;\r\nand, after the combustion was finished, only 23-1/4 cubical inches,\r\nlikewise reduced to the standard, remained; so that the quantity of\r\noxygen gas absorbed during the combustion was 138-3/4 cubical inches,\r\nequal to 69.375 grains.\r\n\r\nA part of the phosphorus remained unconsumed in the bottom of the cups,\r\nwhich being washed on purpose to separate the acid, weighed about 16-1/4\r\ngrains; so that about 45 grains of phosphorus had been burned: But, as\r\nit is hardly possible to avoid an error of one or two grains, I leave\r\nthe quantity so far qualified. Hence, as nearly 45 grains of phosphorus\r\nhad, in this experiment, united with 69.375 grains of oxygen, and as no\r\ngravitating matter could have escaped through the glass, we have a right\r\nto conclude, that the weight of the substance resulting from the\r\ncombustion in form of white flakes, must equal that of the phosphorus\r\nand oxygen employed, which amounts to 114.375 grains. And we shall\r\npresently find, that these flakes consisted entirely of a solid or\r\nconcrete acid. When we reduce these weights to hundredth parts, it will\r\nbe found, that 100 parts of phosphorus require 154 parts of oxygen for\r\nsaturation, and that this combination will produce 254 parts of concrete\r\nphosphoric acid, in form of white fleecy flakes.\r\n\r\nThis experiment proves, in the most convincing manner, that, at a\r\ncertain degree of temperature, oxygen possesses a stronger elective\r\nattraction, or affinity, for phosphorus than for caloric; that, in\r\nconsequence of this, the phosphorus attracts the base of oxygen gas from\r\nthe caloric, which, being set free, spreads itself over the surrounding\r\nbodies. But, though this experiment be so far perfectly conclusive, it\r\nis not sufficiently rigorous, as, in the apparatus described, it is\r\nimpossible to ascertain the weight of the flakes of concrete acid which\r\nare formed; we can therefore only determine this by calculating the\r\nweights of oxygen and phosphorus employed; but as, in physics, and in\r\nchemistry, it is not allowable to suppose what is capable of being\r\nascertained by direct experiment, I thought it necessary to rep at this\r\nexperiment, as follows, upon a larger scale, and by means of a different\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nI took a large glass baloon (A. Pl. iv. fig. 4.) with an opening three\r\ninches diameter, to which was fitted a crystal stopper ground with\r\nemery, and pierced with two holes for the tubes yyy, xxx. Before\r\nshutting the baloon with its stopper, I introduced the support BC,\r\nsurmounted by the china cup D, containing 150 grs. of phosphorus; the\r\nstopper was then fitted to the opening of the baloon, luted with fat\r\nlute, and covered with slips of linen spread with quick-lime and white\r\nof eggs: When the lute was perfectly dry, the weight of the whole\r\napparatus was determined to within a grain, or a grain and a half. I\r\nnext exhausted the baloon, by means of an air pump applied to the tube\r\nXXX, and then introduced oxygen gas by means of the tube yyy, having a\r\nstop cock adapted to it. This kind of experiment is most readily and\r\nmost exactly performed by means of the hydro-pneumatic machine described\r\nby Mr Meusnier and me in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1782, pag. 466.\r\nand explained in the latter part of this work, with several important\r\nadditions and corrections since made to it by Mr Meusnier. With this\r\ninstrument we can readily ascertain, in the most exact manner, both the\r\nquantity of oxygen gas introduced into the baloon, and the quantity\r\nconsumed during the course of the experiment.\r\n\r\nWhen all things were properly disposed, I set fire to the phosphorus\r\nwith a burning glass. The combustion was extremely rapid, accompanied\r\nwith a bright flame, and much heat; as the operation went on, large\r\nquantities of white flakes attached themselves to the inner surface of\r\nthe baloon, so that at last it was rendered quite opake. The quantity\r\nof these flakes at last became so abundant, that, although fresh oxygen\r\ngas was continually supplied, which ought to have supported the\r\ncombustion, yet the phosphorus was soon extinguished. Having allowed the\r\napparatus to cool completely, I first ascertained the quantity of oxygen\r\ngas employed, and weighed the baloon accurately, before it was opened. I\r\nnext washed, dried, and weighed the small quantity of phosphorus\r\nremaining in the cup, on purpose to determine the whole quantity of\r\nphosphorus consumed in the experiment; this residuum of the phosphorus\r\nwas of a yellow ochrey colour. It is evident, that by these several\r\nprecautions, I could easily determine, 1st, the weight of the phosphorus\r\nconsumed; 2d, the weight of the flakes produced by the combustion; and,\r\n3d, the weight of the oxygen which had combined with the phosphorus.\r\nThis experiment gave very nearly the same results with the former, as it\r\nproved that the phosphorus, during its combustion, had absorbed a little\r\nmore than one and a half its weight of oxygen; and I learned with more\r\ncertainty, that the weight of the new substance, produced in the\r\nexperiment, exactly equalled the sum of the weights of the phosphorus\r\nconsumed, and oxygen absorbed, which indeed was easily determinable _a\r\npriori_. If the oxygen gas employed be pure, the residuum after\r\ncombustion is as pure as the gas employed; this proves that nothing\r\nescapes from the phosphorus, capable of altering the purity of the\r\noxygen gas, and that the only action of the phosphorus is to separate\r\nthe oxygen from the caloric, with which it was before united.\r\n\r\nI mentioned above, that when any combustible body is burnt in a hollow\r\nsphere of ice, or in an apparatus properly constructed upon that\r\nprinciple, the quantity of ice melted during the combustion is an exact\r\nmeasure of the quantity of caloric disengaged. Upon this head, the\r\nmemoir given by M. de la Place and me, Aº. 1780, p. 355, may be\r\nconsulted. Having submitted the combustion of phosphorus to this trial,\r\nwe found that one pound of phosphorus melted a little more than 100\r\npounds of ice during its combustion.\r\n\r\nThe combustion of phosphorus succeeds equally well in atmospheric air as\r\nin oxygen gas, with this difference, that the combustion is vastly\r\nslower, being retarded by the large proportion of azotic gas mixed with\r\nthe oxygen gas, and that only about one-fifth part of the air employed\r\nis absorbed, because as the oxygen gas only is absorbed, the proportion\r\nof the azotic gas becomes so great toward the close of the experiment,\r\nas to put an end to the combustion.\r\n\r\nI have already shown, that phosphorus is changed by combustion into an\r\nextremely light, white, flakey matter; and its properties are entirely\r\naltered by this transformation: From being insoluble in water, it\r\nbecomes not only soluble, but so greedy of moisture, as to attract the\r\nhumidity of the air with astonishing rapidity; by this means it is\r\nconverted into a liquid, considerably more dense, and of more specific\r\ngravity than water. In the state of phosphorus before combustion, it had\r\nscarcely any sensible taste, by its union with oxygen it acquires an\r\nextremely sharp and sour taste: in a word, from one of the class of\r\ncombustible bodies, it is changed into an incombustible substance, and\r\nbecomes one of those bodies called acids.\r\n\r\nThis property of a combustible substance to be converted into an acid,\r\nby the addition of oxygen, we shall presently find belongs to a great\r\nnumber of bodies: Wherefore, strict logic requires that we should adopt\r\na common term for indicating all these operations which produce\r\nanalogous results; this is the true way to simplify the study of\r\nscience, as it would be quite impossible to bear all its specifical\r\ndetails in the memory, if they were not classically arranged. For this\r\nreason, we shall distinguish this conversion of phosphorus into an acid,\r\nby its union with oxygen, and in general every combination of oxygen\r\nwith a combustible substance, by the term of _oxygenation_: from which\r\nI shall adopt the verb to _oxygenate_, and of consequence shall say,\r\nthat in _oxygenating_ phosphorus we convert it into an acid.\r\n\r\nSulphur is likewise a combustible body, or, in other words, it is a body\r\nwhich possesses the power of decomposing oxygen gas, by attracting the\r\noxygen from the caloric with which it was combined. This can very easily\r\nbe proved, by means of experiments quite similar to those we have given\r\nwith phosphorus; but it is necessary to premise, that in these\r\noperations with sulphur, the same accuracy of result is not to be\r\nexpected as with phosphorus; because the acid which is formed by the\r\ncombustion of sulphur is difficultly condensible, and because sulphur\r\nburns with more difficulty, and is soluble in the different gasses. But\r\nI can safely assert, from my own experiments, that sulphur in burning\r\nabsorbs oxygen gas; that the resulting acid is considerably heavier than\r\nthe sulphur burnt; that its weight is equal to the sum of the weights of\r\nthe sulphur which has been burnt, and of the oxygen absorbed; and,\r\nlastly that this acid is weighty, incombustible, and miscible with water\r\nin all proportions: The only uncertainty remaining upon this head, is\r\nwith regard to the proportions of sulphur and of oxygen which enter into\r\nthe composition of the acid.\r\n\r\nCharcoal, which, from all our present knowledge regarding it, must be\r\nconsidered as a simple combustible body, has likewise the property of\r\ndecomposing oxygen gas, by absorbing its base from the caloric: But the\r\nacid resulting from this combustion does not condense in the common\r\ntemperature; under the pressure of our atmosphere, it remains in the\r\nstate of gas, and requires a large proportion of water to combine with\r\nor be dissolved in. This acid has, however, all the known properties of\r\nother acids, though in a weaker degree, and combines, like them, with\r\nall the bases which are susceptible of forming neutral salts.\r\n\r\nThe combustion of charcoal in oxygen gas, may be effected like that of\r\nphosphorus in the bell-glass, (A. Pl. IV. fig. 3.) placed over mercury:\r\nbut, as the heat of red hot iron is not sufficient to set fire to the\r\ncharcoal, we must add a small morsel of tinder, with a minute particle\r\nof phosphorus, in the same manner as directed in the experiment for the\r\ncombustion of iron. A detailed account of this experiment will be found\r\nin the memoirs of the academy for 1781, p. 448. By that experiment it\r\nappears, that 28 parts by weight of charcoal require 72 parts of oxygen\r\nfor saturation, and that the aëriform acid produced is precisely equal\r\nin weight to the sum of the weights of the charcoal and oxygen gas\r\nemployed. This aëriform acid was called fixed or fixable air by the\r\nchemists who first discovered it; they did not then know whether it was\r\nair resembling that of the atmosphere, or some other elastic fluid,\r\nvitiated and corrupted by combustion; but since it is now ascertained to\r\nbe an acid, formed like all others by the oxygenation of its peculiar\r\nbase, it is obvious that the name of fixed air is quite ineligible[11].\r\n\r\nBy burning charcoal in the apparatus mentioned p. 60, Mr de la Place and\r\nI found that one lib. of charcoal melted 96 libs. 6 oz. of ice;\r\nthat, during the combustion, 2 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros. 10 grs. of\r\noxygen were absorbed, and that 3 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros. 10 grs. of\r\nacid gas were formed. This gas weighs 0.695 parts of a grain for each\r\ncubical inch, in the common standard temperature and pressure mentioned\r\nabove, so that 34,242 cubical inches of acid gas are produced by the\r\ncombustion of one pound of charcoal.\r\n\r\nI might multiply these experiments, and show by a numerous succession of\r\nfacts, that all acids are formed by the combustion of certain\r\nsubstances; but I am prevented from doing so in place, by the plan\r\nwhich I have laid down, of proceeding only from facts already\r\nascertained, to such as are unknown, and of drawing my examples only\r\nfrom circumstances already explained. In the mean time, however, the\r\nthree examples above cited may suffice for giving a clear and accurate\r\nconception of the manner in which acids are formed. By these it may be\r\nclearly seen, that oxygen is an element common to them all, which\r\nconstitutes their acidity; and that they differ from each other,\r\naccording to the nature of the oxygenated or acidified substance. We\r\nmust therefore, in every acid, carefully distinguish between the\r\nacidifiable, base, which Mr de Morveau calls the radical, and the\r\nacidifiing principle or oxygen.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] It may be proper to remark, though here omitted by the author,\r\nthat, in conformity with the general principles of the new nomenclature,\r\nthis acid is by Mr Lavoisier and his coleagues called the carbonic acid,\r\nand when in the aëriform state carbonic acid gas. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of the Nomenclature of Acids in general, and particularly of those\r\ndrawn from Nitre and Sea-Salt._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt becomes extremely easy, from the principles laid down in the\r\npreceding chapter, to establish a systematic nomenclature for the acids:\r\nThe word _acid_, being used as a generic term, each acid falls to be\r\ndistinguished in language, as in nature, by the name of its base or\r\nradical. Thus, we give the generic name of acids to the products of the\r\ncombustion or oxygenation of phosphorus, of sulphur, and of charcoal;\r\nand these products are respectively named, the _phosphoric acid_, the\r\n_sulphuric acid_, and the _carbonic acid_.\r\n\r\nThere is however, a remarkable circumstance in the oxygenation of\r\ncombustible bodies, and of a part of such bodies as are convertible into\r\nacids, that they are susceptible of different degrees of saturation with\r\noxygen, and that the resulting acids, though formed by the union of the\r\nsame elements, are possessed of different properties, depending upon\r\nthat difference of proportion. Of this, the phosphoric acid, and more\r\nespecially the sulphuric, furnishes us with examples. When sulphur is\r\ncombined with a small proportion of oxygen, it forms, in this first or\r\nlower degree of oxygenation, a volatile acid, having a penetrating\r\nodour, and possessed of very particular qualities. By a larger\r\nproportion of oxygen, it is changed into a fixed, heavy acid, without\r\nany odour, and which, by combination with other bodies, gives products\r\nquite different from those furnished by the former. In this instance,\r\nthe principles of our nomenclature seem to fail; and it seems difficult\r\nto derive such terms from the name of the acidifiable base, as shall\r\ndistinctly express these two degrees of saturation, or oxygenation,\r\nwithout circumlocution. By reflection, however, upon the subject, or\r\nperhaps rather from the necessity of the case, we have thought it\r\nallowable to express these varieties in the oxygenation of the acids, by\r\nsimply varying the termination of their specific names. The volatile\r\nacid produced from sulphur was anciently known to Stahl under the name\r\nof _sulphurous_ acid[12]. We have preserved that term for this acid\r\nfrom sulphur under-saturated with oxygen; and distinguish the other, or\r\ncompletely saturated or oxygenated acid, by the name of _sulphuric_\r\nacid. We shall therefore say, in this new chemical language, that\r\nsulphur, in combining with oxygen, is susceptible of two degrees of\r\nsaturation; that the first, or lesser degree, constitutes sulphurous\r\nacid, which is volatile and penetrating; whilst the second, or higher\r\ndegree of saturation, produces sulphuric acid, which is fixed and\r\ninodorous. We shall adopt this difference of termination for all the\r\nacids which assume several degrees of saturation. Hence we have a\r\nphosphorous and a phosphoric acid, an acetous and an acetic acid; and so\r\non, for others in similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis part of chemical science would have been extremely simple, and the\r\nnomenclature of the acids would not have been at all perplexed, as it is\r\nnow in the old nomenclature, if the base or radical of each acid had\r\nbeen known when the acid itself was discovered. Thus, for instance,\r\nphosphorus being a known substance before the discovery of its acid,\r\nthis latter was rightly distinguished by a term drawn from the name of\r\nits acidifiable base. But when, on the contrary, an acid happened to be\r\ndiscovered before its base, or rather, when the acidifiable base from\r\nwhich it was formed remained unknown, names were adopted for the two,\r\nwhich have not the smallest connection; and thus, not only the memory\r\nbecame burthened with useless appellations, but even the minds of\r\nstudents, nay even of experienced chemists, became filled with false\r\nideas, which time and reflection alone is capable of eradicating. We may\r\ngive an instance of this confusion with respect to the acid sulphur: The\r\nformer chemists having procured this acid from the vitriol of iron, gave\r\nit the name of the vitriolic acid from the name of the substance which\r\nproduced it; and they were then ignorant that the acid procured from\r\nsulphur by combustion was exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened with the aëriform acid formerly called _fixed\r\nair_; it not being known that this acid was the result of combining\r\ncharcoal with oxygen, a variety of denominations have been given to it,\r\nnot one of which conveys just ideas of its nature or origin. We have\r\nfound it extremely easy to correct and modify the ancient language with\r\nrespect to these acids proceeding from known bases, having converted the\r\nname of _vitriolic acid_ into that of _sulphuric_, and the name of\r\n_fixed air_ into that of _carbonic acid_; but it is impossible to follow\r\nthis plan with the acids whose bases are still unknown; with these we\r\nhave been obliged to use a contrary plan, and, instead of forming the\r\nname of the acid from that of its base, have been forced to denominate\r\nthe unknown base from the name of the known acid, as happens in the case\r\nof the acid which is procured from sea salt.\r\n\r\nTo disengage this acid from the alkaline base with which it is combined,\r\nwe have only to pour sulphuric acid upon sea-salt, immediately a brisk\r\neffervescence takes place, white vapours arise, of a very penetrating\r\nodour, and, by only gently heating the mixture, all the acid is driven\r\noff. As, in the common temperature and pressure of our atmosphere, this\r\nacid is naturally in the state of gas, we must use particular\r\nprecautions for retaining it in proper vessels. For small experiments,\r\nthe most simple and most commodious apparatus consists of a small retort\r\nG, (Pl. V. Fig. 5.), into which the sea-salt is introduced, well\r\ndried[13], we then pour on some concentrated sulphuric acid, and\r\nimmediately introduce the beak of the retort under little jars or\r\nbell-glasses A, (same Plate and Fig.), previously filled with\r\nquicksilver. In proportion as the acid gas is disengaged, it passes into\r\nthe jar, and gets to the top of the quicksilver, which it displaces.\r\nWhen the disengagement of the gas slackens, a gentle heat is applied to\r\nthe retort, and gradually increased till nothing more passes over. This\r\nacid gas has a very strong affinity with water, which absorbs an\r\nenormous quantity of it, as is proved by introducing a very thin layer\r\nof water into the glass which contains the gas; for, in an instant, the\r\nwhole acid gas disappears, and combines with the water.\r\n\r\nThis latter circumstance is taken advantage of in laboratories and\r\nmanufactures, on purpose to obtain the acid of sea-salt in a liquid\r\nform; and for this purpose the apparatus (Pl. IV. Fig. 1.) is employed.\r\nIt consists, 1st, of a tubulated retort A, into which the sea-salt, and\r\nafter it the sulphuric acid, are introduced through the opening H; 2d,\r\nof the baloon or recipient c, b, intended for containing the small\r\nquantity of liquid which passes over during the process; and, 3d, of a\r\nset of bottles, with two mouths, L, L, L, L, half filled with water,\r\nintended for absorbing the gas disengaged by the distillation. This\r\napparatus will be more amply described in the latter part of this work.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have not yet been able, either to compose or to decompound\r\nthis acid of sea-salt, we cannot have the smallest doubt that it, like\r\nall other acids, is composed by the union of oxygen with an acidifiable\r\nbase. We have therefore called this unknown substance the _muriatic\r\nbase_, or _muriatic radical_, deriving this name, after the example of\r\nMr Bergman and Mr de Morveau, from the Latin word _muria_, which was\r\nanciently used to signify sea-salt. Thus, without being able exactly to\r\ndetermine the component parts of _muriatic acid_, we design, by that\r\nterm, a volatile acid, which retains the form of gas in the common\r\ntemperature and pressure of our atmosphere, which combines with great\r\nfacility, and in great quantity, with water, and whose acidifiable base\r\nadheres so very intimately with oxygen, that no method has hitherto been\r\ndevised for separating them. If ever this acidifiable base of the\r\nmuriatic acid is discovered to be a known substance, though now unknown\r\nin that capacity, it will be requisite to change its present\r\ndenomination for one analogous with that of its base.\r\n\r\nIn common with sulphuric acid, and several other acids, the muriatic is\r\ncapable of different degrees of oxygenation; but the excess of oxygen\r\nproduces quite contrary effects upon it from what the same circumstance\r\nproduces upon the acid of sulphur. The lower degree of oxygenation\r\nconverts sulphur into a volatile gasseous acid, which only mixes in\r\nsmall proportions with water, whilst a higher oxygenation forms an acid\r\npossessing much stronger acid properties, which is very fixed and cannot\r\nremain in the state of gas but in a very high temperature, which has no\r\nsmell, and which mixes in large proportion with water. With muriatic\r\nacid, the direct reverse takes place; an additional saturation with\r\noxygen renders it more volatile, of a more penetrating odour, less\r\nmiscible with water, and diminishes its acid properties. We were at\r\nfirst inclined to have denominated these two degrees of saturation in\r\nthe same manner as we had done with the acid of sulphur, calling the\r\nless oxygenated _muriatous acid_, and that which is more saturated with\r\noxygen _muriatic acid_: But, as this latter gives very particular\r\nresults in its combinations, and as nothing analogous to it is yet known\r\nin chemistry, we have left the name of muriatic acid to the less\r\nsaturated, and give the latter the more compounded appellation of\r\n_oxygenated muriatic acid_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the base or radical of the acid which is extracted from nitre\r\nor saltpetre be better known, we have judged proper only to modify its\r\nname in the same manner with that of the muriatic acid. It is drawn from\r\nnitre, by the intervention of sulphuric acid, by a process similar to\r\nthat described for extracting the muriatic acid, and by means of the\r\nsame apparatus (Pl. IV. Fig. 1.). In proportion as the acid passes over,\r\nit is in part condensed in the baloon or recipient, and the rest is\r\nabsorbed by the water contained in the bottles L,L,L,L; the water\r\nbecomes first green, then blue, and at last yellow, in proportion to\r\nthe concentration of the acid. During this operation, a large quantity\r\nof oxygen gas, mixed with a small proportion of azotic gas, is\r\ndisengaged.\r\n\r\nThis acid, like all others, is composed of oxygen, united to an\r\nacidifiable base, and is even the first acid in which the existence of\r\noxygen was well ascertained. Its two constituent elements are but weakly\r\nunited, and are easily separated, by presenting any substance with which\r\noxygen has a stronger affinity than with the acidifiable base peculiar\r\nto this acid. By some experiments of this kind, it was first discovered\r\nthat azote, or the base of mephitis or azotic gas, constituted its\r\nacidifiable base or radical; and consequently that the acid of nitre was\r\nreally an azotic acid, having azote for its base, combined with oxygen.\r\nFor these reasons, that we might be consistent with our principles, it\r\nappeared necessary, either to call the acid by the name of _azotic_, or\r\nto name the base _nitric radical_; but from either of these we were\r\ndissuaded, by the following considerations. In the _first_ place, it\r\nseemed difficult to change the name of nitre or saltpetre, which has\r\nbeen universally adopted in society, in manufactures, and in chemistry;\r\nand, on the other hand, azote having been discovered by Mr Berthollet to\r\nbe the base of volatile alkali, or ammoniac, as well as of this acid,\r\nwe thought it improper to call it nitric radical. We have therefore\r\ncontinued the term of azote to the base of that part of atmospheric air\r\nwhich is likewise the nitric and ammoniacal radical; and we have named\r\nthe acid of nitre, in its lower and higher degrees of oxygenation,\r\n_nitrous acid_ in the former, and _nitric acid_ in the latter state;\r\nthus preserving its former appellation properly modified.\r\n\r\nSeveral very respectable chemists have disapproved of this deference for\r\nthe old terms, and wished us to have persevered in perfecting a new\r\nchemical language, without paying any respect for ancient usage; so\r\nthat, by thus steering a kind of middle course, we have exposed\r\nourselves to the censures of one sect of chemists, and to the\r\nexpostulations of the opposite party.\r\n\r\nThe acid of nitre is susceptible of assuming a great number of separate\r\nstates, depending upon its degree of oxygenation, or upon the\r\nproportions in which azote and oxygen enter into its composition. By a\r\nfirst or lowest degree of oxygenation, it forms a particular species of\r\ngas, which we shall continue to name _nitrous gas_; this is composed\r\nnearly of two parts, by weight, of oxygen combined with one part of\r\nazote; and in this state it is not miscible with water. In this gas, the\r\nazote is by no means saturated with oxygen, but, on the contrary, has\r\nstill a very great affinity for that element, and even attracts it from\r\natmospheric air, immediately upon getting into contact with it. This\r\ncombination of nitrous gas with atmospheric air has even become one of\r\nthe methods for determining the quantity of oxygen contained in air, and\r\nconsequently for ascertaining its degree of salubrity.\r\n\r\nThis addition of oxygen converts the nitrous gas into a powerful acid,\r\nwhich has a strong affinity with water, and which is itself susceptible\r\nof various additional degrees of oxygenation. When the proportions of\r\noxygen and azote is below three parts, by weight, of the former, to one\r\nof the latter, the acid is red coloured, and emits copious fumes. In\r\nthis state, by the application of a gentle heat, it gives out nitrous\r\ngas; and we term it, in this degree of oxygenation, _nitrous acid_. When\r\nfour parts, by weight, of oxygen, are combined with one part of azote,\r\nthe acid is clear and colourless, more fixed in the fire than the\r\nnitrous acid, has less odour, and its constituent elements are more\r\nfirmly united. This species of acid, in conformity with our principles\r\nof nomenclature, is called _nitric acid_.\r\n\r\nThus, nitric acid is the acid of nitre, surcharged with oxygen; nitrous\r\nacid is the acid of nitre surcharged with azote; or, what is the same\r\nthing, with nitrous gas; and this latter is azote not sufficiently\r\nsaturated with oxygen to possess the properties of an acid. To this\r\ndegree of oxygenation, we have afterwards, in the course of this work,\r\ngiven the generical name of _oxyd_[14].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] The term formerly used by the English chemists for this acid was\r\nwritten _sulphureous_; but we have thought proper to spell it as above,\r\nthat it may better conform with the similar terminations of nitrous,\r\ncarbonous, &c. to be used hereafter. In general, we have used the\r\nEnglish terminations _ic_ and _ous_ to translate the terms of the Author\r\nwhich end with _ique_ and _cux_, with hardly any other alterations.--E.\r\n\r\n[13] For this purpose, the operation called _decrepitation_ is used,\r\nwhich consists in subjecting it to nearly a red heat, in a proper\r\nvessel, so as to evaporate all its water of crystallization.--E.\r\n\r\n[14] In strict conformity with the principles of the new nomenclature,\r\nbut which the Author has given his reasons for deviating from in this\r\ninstance, the following ought to have been the terms for azote, in its\r\nseveral degrees of oxygenation: Azote, azotic gas, (azote combined with\r\ncaloric), azotic oxyd gas, nitrous acid, and nitric acid.--E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Decomposition of Oxygen Gas by means of Metals, and the\r\nFormation of Metallic Oxyds._\r\n\r\n\r\nOxygen has a stronger affinity with metals heated to a certain degree\r\nthan with caloric; in consequence of which, all metallic bodies,\r\nexcepting gold, silver, and platina, have the property of decomposing\r\noxygen gas, by attracting its base from the caloric with which it was\r\ncombined. We have already shown in what manner this decomposition takes\r\nplace, by means of mercury and iron; having observed, that, in the case\r\nof the first, it must be considered as a kind of gradual combustion,\r\nwhilst, in the latter, the combustion is extremely rapid, and attended\r\nwith a brilliant flame. The use of the heat employed in these operations\r\nis to separate the particles of the metal from each other, and to\r\ndiminish their attraction of cohesion or aggregation, or, what is the\r\nsame thing, their mutual attraction for each other.\r\n\r\nThe absolute weight of metallic substances is augmented in proportion to\r\nthe quantity of oxygen they absorb; they, at the same time, lose their\r\nmetallic splendour, and are reduced into an earthy pulverulent matter.\r\nIn this state metals must not be considered as entirely saturated with\r\noxygen, because their action upon this element is counterbalanced by the\r\npower of affinity between it and caloric. During the calcination of\r\nmetals, the oxygen is therefore acted upon by two separate and opposite\r\npowers, that of its attraction for caloric, and that exerted by the\r\nmetal, and only tends to unite with the latter in consequence of the\r\nexcess of the latter over the former, which is, in general, very\r\ninconsiderable. Wherefore, when metallic substances are oxygenated in\r\natmospheric air, or in oxygen gas, they are not converted into acids\r\nlike sulphur, phosphorus, and charcoal, but are only changed into\r\nintermediate substances, which, though approaching to the nature of\r\nsalts, have not acquired all the saline properties. The old chemists\r\nhave affixed the name of _calx_ not only to metals in this state, but to\r\nevery body which has been long exposed to the action of fire without\r\nbeing melted. They have converted this word _calx_ into a generical\r\nterm, under which they confound calcareous earth, which, from a neutral\r\nsalt, which it really was before calcination, has been changed by fire\r\ninto an earthy alkali, by _losing_ half of its weight, with metals\r\nwhich, by the same means, have joined themselves to a new substance,\r\nwhose quantity often _exceeds_ half their weight, and by which they\r\nhave been changed almost into the nature of acids. This mode of\r\nclassifying substances of so very opposite natures, under the same\r\ngeneric name, would have been quite contrary to our principles of\r\nnomenclature, especially as, by retaining the above term for this state\r\nof metallic substances, we must have conveyed very false ideas of its\r\nnature. We have, therefore, laid aside the expression _metallic calx_\r\naltogether, and have substituted in its place the term _oxyd_, from the\r\nGreek word [Greek: oxys].\r\n\r\nBy this may be seen, that the language we have adopted is both copious\r\nand expressive. The first or lowest degree of oxygenation in bodies,\r\nconverts them into _oxyds_; a second degree of additional oxygenation\r\nconstitutes the class of acids, of which the specific names, drawn from\r\ntheir particular bases, terminate in _ous_, as the _nitrous_ and\r\n_sulphurous_ acids; the third degree of oxygenation changes these into\r\nthe species of acids distinguished by the termination in ic, as the\r\n_nitric_ and _sulphuric_ acids; and, lastly, we can express a fourth, or\r\nhighest degree of oxygenation, by adding the word _oxygenated_ to the\r\nname of the acid, as has been already done with the _oxygenated\r\nmuriatic_ acid.\r\n\r\nWe have not confined the term _oxyd_ to expressing the combinations of\r\nmetals with oxygen, but have extended it to signify that first degree of\r\noxygenation in all bodies, which, without converting them into acids,\r\ncauses them to approach to the nature of salts. Thus, we give the name\r\nof _oxyd of sulphur_ to that soft substance into which sulphur is\r\nconverted by incipient combustion; and we call the yellow matter left by\r\nphosphorus, after combustion, by the name of _oxyd of phosphorus_. In\r\nthe same manner, nitrous gas, which is azote in its first degree of\r\noxygenation, is the _oxyd of azote_. We have likewise oxyds in great\r\nnumbers from the vegetable and animal kingdoms; and I shall show, in the\r\nsequel, that this new language throws great light upon all the\r\noperations of art and nature.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed, that almost all the metallic oxyds have\r\npeculiar and permanent colours. These vary not only in the different\r\nspecies of metals, but even according to the various degrees of\r\noxygenation in the same metal. Hence we are under the necessity of\r\nadding two epithets to each oxyd, one of which indicates the metal\r\n_oxydated_[15], while the other indicates the peculiar colour of the\r\noxyd. Thus, we have the black oxyd of iron, the red oxyd of iron, and\r\nthe yellow oxyd of iron; which expressions respectively answer to the\r\nold unmeaning terms of martial ethiops, colcothar, and rust of iron, or\r\nochre. We have likewise the gray, yellow, and red oxyds of lead, which\r\nanswer to the equally false or insignificant terms, ashes of lead,\r\nmassicot, and minium.\r\n\r\nThese denominations sometimes become rather long, especially when we\r\nmean to indicate whether the metal has been oxydated in the air, by\r\ndetonation with nitre, or by means of acids; but then they always convey\r\njust and accurate ideas of the corresponding object which we wish to\r\nexpress by their use. All this will be rendered perfectly clear and\r\ndistinct by means of the tables which are added to this work.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Here we see the word oxyd converted into the verb _to oxydate_,\r\n_oxydated_, _oxydating_, after the same manner with the derivation of\r\nthe verb _to oxygenate_, _oxygenated_, _oxygenating_, from the word\r\n_oxygen_. I am not clear of the absolute necessity of this second verb\r\nhere first introduced, but think, in a work of this nature, that it is\r\nthe duty of the translator to neglect every other consideration for the\r\nsake of strict fidelity to the ideas of his author.--E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Radical Principle of Water, and of its Decomposition by Charcoal\r\nand Iron._\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil very lately, water has always been thought a simple substance,\r\ninsomuch that the older chemists considered it as an element. Such it\r\nundoubtedly was to them, as they were unable to decompose it; or, at\r\nleast, since the decomposition which took place daily before their eyes\r\nwas entirely unnoticed. But we mean to prove, that water is by no means\r\na simple or elementary substance. I shall not here pretend to give the\r\nhistory of this recent, and hitherto contested discovery, which is\r\ndetailed in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1781, but shall only bring\r\nforwards the principal proofs of the decomposition and composition of\r\nwater; and, I may venture to say, that these will be convincing to such\r\nas consider them impartially.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Experiment First._\r\n\r\nHaving fixed the glass tube EF, (Pl. vii. fig. 11.) of from 8 to 12\r\nlines diameter, across a furnace, with a small inclination from E to F,\r\nlute the superior extremity E to the glass retort A, containing a\r\ndeterminate quantity of distilled water, and to the inferior extremity\r\nF, the worm SS fixed into the neck of the doubly tubulated bottle H,\r\nwhich has the bent tube KK adapted to one of its openings, in such a\r\nmanner as to convey such aëriform fluids or gasses as may be disengaged,\r\nduring the experiment, into a proper apparatus for determining their\r\nquantity and nature.\r\n\r\nTo render the success of this experiment certain, it is necessary that\r\nthe tube EF be made of well annealed and difficultly fusible glass, and\r\nthat it be coated with a lute composed of clay mixed with powdered\r\nstone-ware; besides which, it must be supported about its middle by\r\nmeans of an iron bar passed through the furnace, lest it should soften\r\nand bend during the experiment. A tube of China-ware, or porcellain,\r\nwould answer better than one of glass for this experiment, were it not\r\ndifficult to procure one so entirely free from pores as to prevent the\r\npassage of air or of vapours.\r\n\r\nWhen things are thus arranged, a fire is lighted in the furnace EFCD,\r\nwhich is supported of such a strength as to keep the tube EF red hot,\r\nbut not to make it melt; and, at the same time, such a fire is kept up\r\nin the furnace VVXX, as to keep the water in the retort A continually\r\nboiling.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the water in the retort A is evaporated, it fills the\r\ntube EF, and drives out the air it contained by the tube KK; the aqueous\r\ngas formed by evaporation is condensed by cooling in the worm SS, and\r\nfalls, drop by drop, into the tubulated bottle H. Having continued this\r\noperation until all the water be evaporated from the retort, and having\r\ncarefully emptied all the vessels employed, we find that a quantity of\r\nwater has passed over into the bottle H, exactly equal to what was\r\nbefore contained in the retort A, without any disengagement of gas\r\nwhatsoever: So that this experiment turns out to be a simple\r\ndistillation; and the result would have been exactly the same, if the\r\nwater had been run from one vessel into the other, through the tube EF,\r\nwithout having undergone the intermediate incandescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Experiment Second._\r\n\r\nThe apparatus being disposed, as in the former experiment, 28 grs. of\r\ncharcoal, broken into moderately small parts, and which has previously\r\nbeen exposed for a long time to a red heat in close vessels, are\r\nintroduced into the tube EF. Every thing else is managed as in the\r\npreceding experiment.\r\n\r\nThe water contained in the retort A is distilled, as in the former\r\nexperiment, and, being condensed in the worm, falls into the bottle H;\r\nbut, at the same time, a considerable quantity of gas is disengaged,\r\nwhich, escaping by the tube KK, is received in a convenient apparatus\r\nfor that purpose. After the operation is finished, we find nothing but a\r\nfew atoms of ashes remaining in the tube EF; the 28 grs. of charcoal\r\nhaving entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen the disengaged gasses are carefully examined, they are sound to\r\nweigh 113.7 grs.[16]; these are of two kinds, viz. 144 cubical inches\r\nof carbonic acid gas, weighing 100 grs. and 380 cubical inches of a\r\nvery light gas, weighing only 13.7 grs. which takes fire when in\r\ncontact with air, by the approach of a lighted body; and, when the water\r\nwhich has passed over into the bottle H is carefully examined, it is\r\nfound to have lost 85.7 grs. of its weight. Thus, in this experiment,\r\n85.7 grs. of water, joined to 28 grs. of charcoal, have combined in\r\nsuch a way as to form 100 grs. of carbonic acid, and 13.7 grs. of a\r\nparticular gas capable of being burnt.\r\n\r\nI have already shown, that 100 grs. of carbonic acid gas consists of\r\n72 grs. of oxygen, combined with 28 grs. of charcoal; hence the 28\r\ngrs. of charcoal placed in the glass tube have acquired 72 grs. of\r\noxygen from the water; and it follows, that 85.7 grs. of water are\r\ncomposed of 72 grs. of oxygen, combined with 13.7 grs. of a gas\r\nsusceptible of combustion. We shall see presently that this gas cannot\r\npossibly have been disengaged from the charcoal, and must, consequently,\r\nhave been produced from the water.\r\n\r\nI have suppressed some circumstances in the above account of this\r\nexperiment, which would only have complicated and obscured its results\r\nin the minds of the reader. For instance, the inflammable gas dissolves\r\na very small part of the charcoal, by which means its weight is somewhat\r\naugmented, and that of the carbonic gas proportionally diminished.\r\nAltho' the alteration produced by this circumstance is very\r\ninconsiderable; yet I have thought it necessary to determine its effects\r\nby rigid calculation, and to report, as above, the results of the\r\nexperiment in its simplified state, as if this circumstance had not\r\nhappened. At any rate, should any doubts remain respecting the\r\nconsequences I have drawn from this experiment, they will be fully\r\ndissipated by the following experiments, which I am going to adduce in\r\nsupport of my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Experiment Third._\r\n\r\nThe apparatus being disposed exactly as in the former experiment, with\r\nthis difference, that instead of the 28 grs. of charcoal, the tube EF\r\nis filled with 274 grs. of soft iron in thin plates, rolled up\r\nspirally. The tube is made red hot by means of its furnace, and the\r\nwater in the retort A is kept constantly boiling till it be all\r\nevaporated, and has passed through the tube EF, so as to be condensed in\r\nthe bottle H.\r\n\r\nNo carbonic acid gas is disengaged in this experiment, instead of which\r\nwe obtain 416 cubical inches, or 15 grs. of inflammable gas, thirteen\r\ntimes lighter than atmospheric air. By examining the water which has\r\nbeen distilled, it is found to have lost 100 grs. and the 274 grs.\r\nof iron confined in the tube are found to have acquired 85 grs.\r\nadditional weight, and its magnitude is considerably augmented. The iron\r\nis now hardly at all attractable by the magnet; it dissolves in acids\r\nwithout effervescence; and, in short, it is converted into a black oxyd,\r\nprecisely similar to that which has been burnt in oxygen gas.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment we have a true _oxydation_ of iron, by means of\r\nwater, exactly similar to that produced in air by the assistance of\r\nheat. One hundred grains of water having been decomposed, 85 grs. of\r\noxygen have combined with the iron, so as to convert it into the state\r\nof black oxyd, and 15 grs. of a peculiar inflammable gas are\r\ndisengaged: From all this it clearly follows, that water is composed of\r\noxygen combined with the base of an inflammable gas, in the respective\r\nproportions of 85 parts, by weight of the former, to 15 parts of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThus water, besides the oxygen, which is one of its elements in common\r\nwith many other substances, contains another element as its constituent\r\nbase or radical, and for which we must find an appropriate term. None\r\nthat we could think of seemed better adapted than the word _hydrogen_,\r\nwhich signifies the _generative principle of water_, from [Greek: ydor]\r\n_aqua_, and [Greek: geinomas] _gignor_[17]. We call the combination of\r\nthis element with caloric _hydrogen gas_; and the term hydrogen\r\nexpresses the base of that gas, or the radical of water.\r\n\r\nThis experiment furnishes us with a new combustible body, or, in other\r\nwords, a body which has so much affinity with oxygen as to draw it from\r\nits connection with caloric, and to decompose air or oxygen gas. This\r\ncombustible body has itself so great affinity with caloric, that, unless\r\nwhen engaged in a combination with some other body, it always subsists\r\nin the aëriform or gasseous state, in the usual temperature and pressure\r\nof our atmosphere. In this state of gas it is about 1/13 of the weight\r\nof an equal bulk of atmospheric air; it is not absorbed by water, though\r\nit is capable of holding a small quantity of that fluid in solution, and\r\nit is incapable of being used for respiration.\r\n\r\nAs the property this gas possesses, in common with all other combustible\r\nbodies, is nothing more than the power of decomposing air, and carrying\r\noff its oxygen from the caloric with which it was combined, it is easily\r\nunderstood that it cannot burn, unless in contact with air or oxygen\r\ngas. Hence, when we set fire to a bottle full of this gas, it burns\r\ngently, first at the neck of the bottle, and then in the inside of it,\r\nin proportion as the external air gets in: This combustion is slow and\r\nsuccessive, and only takes place at the surface of contact between the\r\ntwo gasses. It is quite different when the two gasses are mixed before\r\nthey are set on fire: If, for instance, after having introduced one part\r\nof oxygen gas into a narrow mouthed bottle, we fill it up with two\r\nparts of hydrogen gas, and bring a lighted taper, or other burning body,\r\nto the mouth of the bottle, the combustion of the two gasses takes place\r\ninstantaneously with a violent explosion. This experiment ought only to\r\nbe made in a bottle of very strong green glass, holding not more than a\r\npint, and wrapped round with twine, otherwise the operator will be\r\nexposed to great danger from the rupture of the bottle, of which the\r\nfragments will be thrown about with great force.\r\n\r\nIf all that has been related above, concerning the decomposition of\r\nwater, be exactly conformable to truth;--if, as I have endeavoured to\r\nprove, that substance be really composed of hydrogen, as its proper\r\nconstituent element, combined with oxygen, it ought to follow, that, by\r\nreuniting these two elements together, we should recompose water; and\r\nthat this actually happens may be judged of by the following experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Experiment Fourth._\r\n\r\nI took a large cristal baloon, A, Pl. iv. fig. 5. holding about 30\r\npints, having a large opening, to which was cemented the plate of copper\r\nBC, pierced with four holes, in which four tubes terminate. The first\r\ntube, H h, is intended to be adapted to an air pump, by which the\r\nbaloon is to be exhausted of its air. The second tube gg, communicates,\r\nby its extremity MM, with a reservoir of oxygen gas, with which the\r\nbaloon is to be filled. The third tube d D d', communicates, by its\r\nextremity d NN, with a reservoir of hydrogen gas. The extremity d' of\r\nthis tube terminates in a capillary opening, through which the hydrogen\r\ngas contained in the reservoir is forced, with a moderate degree of\r\nquickness, by the pressure of one or two inches of water. The fourth\r\ntube contains a metallic wire GL, having a knob at its extremity L,\r\nintended for giving an electrical spark from L to d', on purpose to set\r\nfire to the hydrogen gas: This wire is moveable in the tube, that we may\r\nbe able to separate the knob L from the extremity d' of the tube D d'.\r\nThe three tubes d D d', gg, and H h, are all provided with stop-cocks.\r\n\r\nThat the hydrogen gas and oxygen gas may be as much as possible deprived\r\nof water, they are made to pass, in their way to the baloon A, through\r\nthe tubes MM, NN, of about an inch diameter, and filled with salts,\r\nwhich, from their deliquescent nature, greedily attract the moisture of\r\nthe air: Such are the acetite of potash, and the muriat or nitrat of\r\nlime[18]. These salts must only be reduced to a coarse powder, lest\r\nthey run into lumps, and prevent the gasses from geting through their\r\ninterstices.\r\n\r\nWe must be provided before hand with a sufficient quantity of oxygen\r\ngas, carefully purified from all admixture of carbonic acid, by long\r\ncontact with a solution of potash[19].\r\n\r\nWe must likewise have a double quantity of hydrogen gas, carefully\r\npurified in the same manner by long contact with a solution of potash in\r\nwater. The best way of obtaining this gas free from mixture is, by\r\ndecomposing water with very pure soft iron, as directed in Exp. 3. of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nHaving adjusted every thing properly, as above directed, the tube H h is\r\nadapted to an air-pump, and the baloon A is exhausted of its air. We\r\nnext admit the oxygen gas so as to fill the baloon, and then, by means\r\nof pressure, as is before mentioned, force a small stream of hydrogen\r\ngas through its tube D d', which we immediately set on fire by an\r\nelectric spark. By means of the above described apparatus, we can\r\ncontinue the mutual combustion of these two gasses for a long time, as\r\nwe have the power of supplying them to the baloon from their reservoirs,\r\nin proportion as they are consumed. I have in another place[20] given a\r\ndescription of the apparatus used in this experiment, and have explained\r\nthe manner of ascertaining the quantities of the gasses consumed with\r\nthe most scrupulous exactitude.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the advancement of the combustion, there is a\r\ndeposition of water upon the inner surface of the baloon or matrass A:\r\nThe water gradually increases in quantity, and, gathering into large\r\ndrops, runs down to the bottom of the vessel. It is easy to ascertain\r\nthe quantity of water collected, by weighing the baloon both before and\r\nafter the experiment. Thus we have a twofold verification of our\r\nexperiment, by ascertaining both the quantities of the gasses employed,\r\nand of the water formed by their combustion: These two quantities must\r\nbe equal to each other. By an operation of this kind, Mr Meusnier and I\r\nascertained that it required 85 parts, by weight, of oxygen, united to\r\n15 parts of hydrogen, to compose 100 parts of water. This experiment,\r\nwhich has not hitherto been published, was made in presence of a\r\nnumerous committee from the Royal Academy. We exerted the most\r\nscrupulous attention to its accuracy; and have reason to believe that\r\nthe above propositions cannot vary a two hundredth part from absolute\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments, both analytical and synthetic, we may now affirm\r\nthat we have ascertained, with as much certainty as is possible in\r\nphysical or chemical subjects, that water is not a simple elementary\r\nsubstance, but is composed of two elements, oxygen and hydrogen; which\r\nelements, when existing separately, have so strong affinity for caloric,\r\nas only to subsist under the form of gas in the common temperature and\r\npressure of our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis decomposition and recomposition of water is perpetually operating\r\nbefore our eyes, in the temperature of the atmosphere, by means of\r\ncompound elective attraction. We shall presently see that the phenomena\r\nattendant upon vinous fermentation, putrefaction, and even vegetation,\r\nare produced, at least in a certain degree, by decomposition of water.\r\nIt is very extraordinary that this fact should have hitherto been\r\noverlooked by natural philosophers and chemists: Indeed, it strongly\r\nproves, that, in chemistry, as in moral philosophy, it is extremely\r\ndifficult to overcome prejudices imbibed in early education, and to\r\nsearch for truth in any other road than the one we have been accustomed\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\nI shall finish this chapter by an experiment much less demonstrative\r\nthan those already related, but which has appeared to make more\r\nimpression than any other upon the minds of many people. When 16 ounces\r\nof alkohol are burnt in an apparatus[21] properly adapted for collecting\r\nall the water disengaged during the combustion, we obtain from 17 to 18\r\nounces of water. As no substance can furnish a product larger than its\r\noriginal bulk, it follows, that something else has united with the\r\nalkohol during its combustion; and I have already shown that this must\r\nbe oxygen, or the base of air. Thus alkohol contains hydrogen, which is\r\none of the elements of water; and the atmospheric air contains oxygen,\r\nwhich is the other element necessary to the composition of water. This\r\nexperiment is a new proof that water is a compound substance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] In the latter part of this work will be found a particular account\r\nof the processes necessary for separating the different kinds of gasses,\r\nand for determining their quantities.--A.\r\n\r\n[17] This expression Hydrogen has been very severely criticised by some,\r\nwho pretend that it signifies engendered by water, and not that which\r\nengenders water. The experiments related in this chapter prove, that,\r\nwhen water is decomposed, hydrogen is produced, and that, when hydrogen\r\nis combined with oxygen, water is produced: So that we may say, with\r\nequal truth, that water is produced from hydrogen, or hydrogen is\r\nproduced from water.--A.\r\n\r\n[18] See the nature of these salts in the second part of this book.--A.\r\n\r\n[19] By potash is here meant, pure or caustic alkali, deprived of\r\ncarbonic acid by means of quick-lime: In general, we may observe here,\r\nthat all the alkalies and earths must invariably be considered as in\r\ntheir pure or caustic state, unless otherwise expressed.--E. The method\r\nof obtaining this pure alkali of potash will be given in the sequel.--A.\r\n\r\n[20] See the third part of this work.--A.\r\n\r\n[21] See an account of this apparatus in the third part of this\r\nwork.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n_Of the quantities of Caloric disengaged from different species of\r\nCombustion._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned, that, when any body is burnt in the center of\r\na hollow sphere of ice and supplied with air at the temperature of zero\r\n(32°), the quantity of ice melted from the inside of the sphere becomes\r\na measure of the relative quantities of caloric disengaged. Mr de la\r\nPlace and I gave a description of the apparatus employed for this kind\r\nof experiment in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1780, p. 355; and a\r\ndescription and plate of the same apparatus will be found in the third\r\npart of this work. With this apparatus, phosphorus, charcoal, and\r\nhydrogen gas, gave the following results:\r\n\r\nOne pound of phosphorus melted 100 libs. of ice.\r\n\r\nOne pound of charcoal melted 96 libs. 8 oz.\r\n\r\nOne pound of hydrogen gas melted 295 libs. 9 oz. 3-1/2 gros.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete acid is formed by the combustion of phosphorus, it is\r\nprobable that very little caloric remains in the acid, and,\r\nconsequently, that the above experiment gives us very nearly the whole\r\nquantity of caloric contained in the oxygen gas. Even if we suppose the\r\nphosphoric acid to contain a good deal of caloric, yet, as the\r\nphosphorus must have contained nearly an equal quantity before\r\ncombustion, the error must be very small, as it will only consist of the\r\ndifference between what was contained in the phosphorus before, and in\r\nthe phosphoric acid after combustion.\r\n\r\nI have already shown in Chap. V. that one pound of phosphorus absorbs\r\none pound eight ounces of oxygen during combustion; and since, by the\r\nsame operation, 100 lib. of ice are melted, it follows, that the\r\nquantity of caloric contained in one pound of oxygen gas is capable of\r\nmelting 66 libs. 10 oz. 5 gros 24 grs. of ice.\r\n\r\nOne pound of charcoal during combustion melts only 96 libs. 8 oz. of\r\nice, whilst it absorbs 2 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros 10 grs. of oxygen.\r\nBy the experiment with phosphorus, this quantity of oxygen gas ought to\r\ndisengage a quantity of caloric sufficient to melt 171 libs. 6 oz. 5\r\ngros of ice; consequently, during this experiment, a quantity of\r\ncaloric, sufficient to melt 74 libs. 14 oz. 5 gros of ice\r\ndisappears. Carbonic acid is not, like phosphoric acid, in a concrete\r\nstate after combustion but in the state of gas, and requires to be\r\nunited with caloric to enable it to subsist in that state; the quantity\r\nof caloric missing in the last experiment is evidently employed for that\r\npurpose. When we divide that quantity by the weight of carbonic acid,\r\nformed by the combustion of one pound of charcoal, we find that the\r\nquantity of caloric necessary for changing one pound of carbonic acid\r\nfrom the concrete to the gasseous state, would be capable of melting 20\r\nlibs. 15 oz. 5 gros of ice.\r\n\r\nWe may make a similar calculation with the combustion of hydrogen gas\r\nand the consequent formation of water. During the combustion of one\r\npound of hydrogen gas, 5 libs. 10 oz. 5 gros 24 grs. of oxygen\r\ngas are absorbed, and 295 libs. 9 oz. 3-1/2 gros of ice are\r\nmelted. But 5 libs. 10 oz. 5 gros 24 grs. of oxygen gas, in\r\nchanging from the aëriform to the solid state, loses, according to the\r\nexperiment with phosphorus, enough of caloric to have melted 377 libs.\r\n12 oz. 3 gros of ice. There is only disengaged, from the same\r\nquantity of oxygen, during its combustion with hydrogen gas, as much\r\ncaloric as melts 295 libs. 2 oz. 3-1/2 gros; wherefore there\r\nremains in the water at Zero (32°), formed, during this experiment, as\r\nmuch caloric as would melt 82 libs. 9 oz. 7-1/2 gros of ice.\r\n\r\nHence, as 6 libs. 10 oz. 5 gros 24 grs. of water are formed from\r\nthe combustion of one pound of hydrogen gas with 5 libs. 10 oz. 5\r\ngros 24 grs. of oxygen, it follows that, in each pound of water, at\r\nthe temperature of Zero, (32°), there exists as much caloric as would\r\nmelt 12 libs. 5 oz. 2 gros 48 grs. of ice, without taking into\r\naccount the quantity originally contained in the hydrogen gas, which we\r\nhave been obliged to omit, for want of data to calculate its quantity.\r\nFrom this it appears that water, even in the state of ice, contains a\r\nconsiderable quantity of caloric, and that oxygen, in entering into that\r\ncombination, retains likewise a good proportion.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments, we may assume the following results as\r\nsufficiently established.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Combustion of Phosphorus._\r\n\r\nFrom the combustion of phosphorus, as related in the foregoing\r\nexperiments, it appears, that one pound of phosphorus requires 1 lib.\r\n8 oz. of oxygen gas for its combustion, and that 2 libs. 8 oz. of\r\nconcrete phosphoric acid are produced.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of caloric disengaged by the\r\ncombustion of one pound of phosphorus, expressed\r\nby the number of pounds of ice melted\r\nduring that operation, is                           100.00000.\r\n\r\nThe quantity disengaged from each pound of\r\noxygen, during the combustion of phosphorus,\r\nexpressed in the same manner, is                     66.66667.\r\n\r\nThe quantity disengaged during the formation\r\nof one pound of phosphoric acid,                     40.00000.\r\n\r\nThe quantity remaining in each pound of phosphoric\r\nacid,                                                 0.00000(A).\r\n\r\n[Note A: We here suppose the phosphoric acid not to contain any caloric,\r\nwhich is not strictly true; but, as I have before observed, the quantity\r\nit really contains is probably very small, and we have not given it a\r\nvalue, for want of a sufficient data to go upon.--A.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Combustion of Charcoal._\r\n\r\nIn the combustion of one pound of charcoal, 2 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros\r\n10 grs. of oxygen gas are absorbed, and 3 libs. 9 oz. 1 gros 10\r\ngrs. of carbonic acid gas are formed.\r\n\r\nCaloric, disengaged daring the combustion\r\nof one pound of charcoal,                        96.50000(A).\r\n\r\nCaloric disengaged during the combustion of\r\ncharcoal, from each pound of oxygen gas\r\nabsorbed,                                        37.52823.\r\n\r\nCaloric disengaged during the formation of\r\none pound of carbonic acid gas,                  27.02024.\r\n\r\nCaloric retained by each pound of oxygen\r\nafter the combustion,                            29.13844.\r\n\r\nCaloric necessary for supporting one pound\r\nof carbonic acid in the state of gas,            20.97960.\r\n\r\n[Note A: All these relative quantities of caloric are expressed by the\r\nnumber of pounds of ice, and decimal parts, melted during the several\r\noperations.--E.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Combustion of Hydrogen Gas._\r\n\r\nIn the combustion of one pound of hydrogen gas, 5 libs. 10 oz. 5\r\ngros 24 grs. of oxygen gas are absorbed, and 6 libs. 10 oz. 5\r\ngros 24 grs. of water are formed.\r\n\r\nCaloric from each lib. of hydrogen gas,                       295.58950.\r\nCaloric from each lib. of oxygen gas,                          52.16280.\r\nCaloric disengaged during the formation of each pound of water,  44.33840.\r\nCaloric retained by each lib. of oxygen after\r\n  combustion with hydrogen,                                      14.50386.\r\nCaloric retained by each lib. of water at\r\n  the temperature of Zero (32°),                                 12.32823.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Formation of Nitric Acid._\r\n\r\nWhen we combine nitrous gas with oxygen gas, so as to form nitric or\r\nnitrous acid a degree of heat is produced, which is much less\r\nconsiderable than what is evolved during the other combinations of\r\noxygen; whence it follows that oxygen, when it becomes fixed in nitric\r\nacid, retains a great part of the heat which it possessed in the state\r\nof gas. It is certainly possible to determine the quantity of caloric\r\nwhich is disengaged during the combination of these two gasses, and\r\nconsequently to determine what quantity remains after the combination\r\ntakes place. The first of these quantities might be ascertained, by\r\nmaking the combination of the two gasses in an apparatus surrounded by\r\nice; but, as the quantity of caloric disengaged is very inconsiderable,\r\nit would be necessary to operate upon a large quantity of the two gasses\r\nin a very troublesome and complicated apparatus. By this consideration,\r\nMr de la Place and I have hitherto been prevented from making the\r\nattempt. In the mean time, the place of such an experiment may be\r\nsupplied by calculations, the results of which cannot be very far from\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nMr de la Place and I deflagrated a convenient quantity of nitre and\r\ncharcoal in an ice apparatus, and found that twelve pounds of ice were\r\nmelted by the deflagration of one pound of nitre. We shall see, in the\r\nsequel, that one pound of nitre is composed, as under, of\r\n\r\nPotash   7 oz. 6 gros 51.84 grs. = 4515.84 grs.\r\nDry acid 8       1        21.16        = 4700.16.\r\n\r\nThe above quantity of dry acid is composed of\r\n\r\nOxygen   6 oz. 3 gros 66.34 grs. = 3738.34 grs.\r\nAzote    1       5        25.82        = 961.82.\r\n\r\nBy this we find that, during the above deflagration, 2 gros 1-1/3\r\ngr. of charcoal have suffered combustion, alongst with 3738.34 grs.\r\nor 6 oz. 3 gros 66.34 grs. of oxygen. Hence, since 12 libs. of\r\nice were melted during the combustion, it follows, that one pound of\r\noxygen burnt in the same manner would have melted 29.58320 libs. of\r\nice. To which the quantity of caloric, retained by a pound of oxygen\r\nafter combining with charcoal to form carbonic acid gas, being added,\r\nwhich was already ascertained to be capable of melting 29.13844 libs.\r\nof ice, we have for the total quantity of caloric remaining in a pound\r\nof oxygen, when combined with nitrous gas in the nitric acid 58.72164;\r\nwhich is the number of pounds of ice the caloric remaining in the oxygen\r\nin that state is capable of melting.\r\n\r\nWe have before seen that, in the state of oxygen gas, it contained at\r\nleast 66.66667; wherefore it follows that, in combining with azote to\r\nform nitric acid, it only loses 7.94502. Farther experiments upon this\r\nsubject are necessary to ascertain how far the results of this\r\ncalculation may agree with direct fact. This enormous quantity of\r\ncaloric retained by oxygen in its combination into nitric acid, explains\r\nthe cause of the great disengagement of caloric during the\r\ndeflagrations of nitre; or, more strictly speaking, upon all occasions\r\nof the decomposition of nitric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Combustion of Wax._\r\n\r\nHaving examined several cases of simple combustion, I mean now to give a\r\nfew examples of a more complex nature. One pound of wax-taper being\r\nallowed to burn slowly in an ice apparatus, melted 133 libs. 2 oz.\r\n5-1/3 gros of ice. According to my experiments in the Memoirs of the\r\nAcademy for 1784, p. 606, one pound of wax-taper consists of 13 oz. 1\r\ngros 23 grs. of charcoal, and 2 oz. 6 gros 49 grs. of\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\nBy the foregoing experiments, the above\r\nquantity of charcoal ought to melt             79.39390 libs. of ice;\r\nand the hydrogen should melt                   52.37605\r\n                                              ---------\r\n                  In all                      131.76995 libs.\r\n\r\nThus, we see the quantity of caloric disengaged from a burning taper, is\r\npretty exactly conformable to what was obtained by burning separately a\r\nquantity of charcoal and hydrogen equal to what enters into its\r\ncomposition. These experiments with the taper were several times\r\nrepeated, so that I have reason to believe them accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Combustion of Olive Oil._\r\n\r\nWe included a burning lamp, containing a determinate quantity of\r\nolive-oil, in the ordinary apparatus, and, when the experiment was\r\nfinished, we ascertained exactly the quantities of oil consumed, and of\r\nice melted; the result was, that, during the combustion of one pound of\r\nolive-oil, 148 libs. 14 oz. 1 gros of ice were melted. By my\r\nexperiments in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1784, and of which the\r\nfollowing Chapter contains an abstract, it appears that one pound of\r\nolive-oil consists of 12 oz. 5 gros 5 grs. of charcoal, and 3\r\noz. 2 gros 67 grs. of hydrogen. By the foregoing experiments, that\r\nquantity of charcoal should melt 76.18723 libs. of ice, and the\r\nquantity of hydrogen in a pound of the oil should melt 62.15053 libs.\r\nThe sum of these two gives 138.33776 libs. of ice, which the two\r\nconstituent elements of the oil would have melted, had they separately\r\nsuffered combustion, whereas the oil really melted 148.88330 libs.\r\nwhich gives an excess of 10.54554 in the result of the experiment above\r\nthe calculated result, from data furnished by former experiments.\r\n\r\nThis difference, which is by no means very considerable, may arise from\r\nerrors which are unavoidable in experiments of this nature, or it may be\r\nowing to the composition of oil not being as yet exactly ascertained. It\r\nproves, however, that there is a great agreement between the results of\r\nour experiments, respecting the combination of caloric, and those which\r\nregard its disengagement.\r\n\r\nThe following desiderata still remain to be determined, viz. What\r\nquantity of caloric is retained by oxygen, after combining with metals,\r\nso as to convert them into oxyds; What quantity is contained by\r\nhydrogen, in its different states of existence; and to ascertain, with\r\nmore precision than is hitherto attained, how much caloric is disengaged\r\nduring the formation of water, as there still remain considerable doubts\r\nwith respect to our present determination of this point, which can only\r\nbe removed by farther experiments. We are at present occupied with this\r\ninquiry; and, when once these several points are well ascertained, which\r\nwe hope they will soon be, we shall probably be under the necessity of\r\nmaking considerable corrections upon most of the results of the\r\nexperiments and calculations in this Chapter. I did not, however,\r\nconsider this as a sufficient reason for withholding so much as is\r\nalready known from such as may be inclined to labour upon the same\r\nsubject. It is difficult, in our endeavours to discover the principles\r\nof a new science, to avoid beginning by guess-work; and it is rarely\r\npossible to arrive at perfection from the first setting out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n_Of the Combination of Combustible Substances with each other._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs combustible substances in general have a great affinity for oxygen,\r\nthey ought likewise to attract, or tend to combine with each other;\r\n_quae sunt eadem uni tertio, sunt eadem inter se_; and the axiom is\r\nfound to be true. Almost all the metals, for instance, are capable of\r\nuniting with each other, and forming what are called _alloys_[22], in\r\ncommon language. Most of these, like all combinations, are susceptible\r\nof several degrees of saturation; the greater number of these alloys are\r\nmore brittle than the pure metals of which they are composed, especially\r\nwhen the metals alloyed together are considerably different in their\r\ndegrees of fusibility. To this difference in fusibility, part of the\r\nphenomena attendant upon _alloyage_ are owing, particularly the property\r\nof iron, called by workmen _hotshort_. This kind of iron must be\r\nconsidered as an alloy, or mixture of pure iron, which is almost\r\ninfusible, with a small portion of some other metal which fuses in a\r\nmuch lower degree of heat. So long as this alloy remains cold, and both\r\nmetals are in the solid state, the mixture is malleable; but, if heated\r\nto a sufficient degree to liquify the more fusible metal, the particles\r\nof the liquid metal, which are interposed between the particles of the\r\nmetal remaining solid, must destroy their continuity, and occasion the\r\nalloy to become brittle. The alloys of mercury, with the other metals,\r\nhave usually been called _amalgams_, and we see no inconvenience from\r\ncontinuing the use of that term.\r\n\r\nSulphur, phosphorus, and charcoal, readily unite with metals.\r\nCombinations of sulphur with metals are usually named _pyrites_. Their\r\ncombinations with phosphorus and charcoal are either not yet named, or\r\nhave received new names only of late; so that we have not scrupled to\r\nchange them according to our principles. The combinations of metal and\r\nsulphur we call _sulphurets_, those with phosphorus _phosphurets_, and\r\nthose formed with charcoal _carburets_. These denominations are extended\r\nto all the combinations into which the above three substances enter,\r\nwithout being previously oxygenated. Thus, the combination of sulphur\r\nwith potash, or fixed vegetable alkali, is called _sulphuret of potash_;\r\nthat which it forms with ammoniac, or volatile alkali, is termed\r\n_sulphuret of ammoniac_.\r\n\r\nHydrogen is likewise capable of combining with many combustible\r\nsubstances. In the state of gas, it dissolves charcoal, sulphur,\r\nphosphorus, and several metals; we distinguish these combinations by the\r\nterms, _carbonated hydrogen gas_, _sulphurated hydrogen gas_, and\r\n_phosphorated hydrogen gas_. The sulphurated hydrogen gas was called\r\n_hepatic air_ by former chemists, or _foetid air from sulphur_, by Mr\r\nScheele. The virtues of several mineral waters, and the foetid smell of\r\nanimal excrements, chiefly arise from the presence of this gas. The\r\nphosphorated hydrogen gas is remarkable for the property, discovered by\r\nMr Gengembre, of taking fire spontaneously upon getting into contact\r\nwith atmospheric air, or, what is better, with oxygen gas. This gas has\r\na strong flavour, resembling that of putrid fish; and it is very\r\nprobable that the phosphorescent quality of fish, in the state of\r\nputrefaction, arises from the escape of this species of gas. When\r\nhydrogen and charcoal are combined together, without the intervention of\r\ncaloric, to bring the hydrogen into the state of gas, they form oil,\r\nwhich is either fixed or volatile, according to the proportions of\r\nhydrogen and charcoal in its composition. The chief difference between\r\nfixed or fat oils drawn from vegetables by expression, and volatile or\r\nessential oils, is, that the former contains an excess of charcoal,\r\nwhich is separated when the oils are heated above the degree of boiling\r\nwater; whereas the volatile oils, containing a just proportion of these\r\ntwo constituent ingredients, are not liable to be decomposed by that\r\nheat, but, uniting with caloric into the gasseous state, pass over in\r\ndistillation unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn the Memoirs of the Academy for 1784, p. 593. I gave an account of my\r\nexperiments upon the composition of oil and alkohol, by the union of\r\nhydrogen with charcoal, and of their combination with oxygen. By these\r\nexperiments, it appears that fixed oils combine with oxygen during\r\ncombustion, and are thereby converted into water and carbonic acid. By\r\nmeans of calculation applied to the products of these experiments, we\r\nfind that fixed oil is composed of 21 parts, by weight, of hydrogen\r\ncombined with 79 parts of charcoal. Perhaps the solid substances of an\r\noily nature, such as wax, contain a proportion of oxygen, to which they\r\nowe their state of solidity. I am at present engaged in a series of\r\nexperiments, which I hope will throw great light upon this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of being examined, whether hydrogen in its concrete state,\r\nuncombined with caloric, be susceptible of combination with sulphur,\r\nphosphorus, and the metals. There is nothing that we know of, which, _a\r\npriori_, should render these combinations impossible; for combustible\r\nbodies being in general susceptible of combination with each other,\r\nthere is no evident reason for hydrogen being an exception to the rule:\r\nHowever, no direct experiment as yet establishes either the possibility\r\nor impossibility of this union. Iron and zinc are the most likely, of\r\nall the metals, for entering into combination with hydrogen; but, as\r\nthese have the property of decomposing water, and as it is very\r\ndifficult to get entirely free from moisture in chemical experiments, it\r\nis hardly possible to determine whether the small portions of hydrogen\r\ngas, obtained in certain experiments with these metals, were previously\r\ncombined with the metal in the state of solid hydrogen, or if they were\r\nproduced by the decomposition of a minute quantity of water. The more\r\ncare we take to prevent the presence of water in these experiments, the\r\nless is the quantity of hydrogen gas procured; and, when very accurate\r\nprecautions are employed, even that quantity becomes hardly sensible.\r\n\r\nHowever this inquiry may turn out respecting the power of combustible\r\nbodies, as sulphur, phosphorus, and metals, to absorb hydrogen, we are\r\ncertain that they only absorb a very small portion; and that this\r\ncombination, instead of being essential to their constitution, can only\r\nbe considered as a foreign substance, which contaminates their purity.\r\nIt is the province of the advocates[23] for this system to prove, by\r\ndecisive experiments, the real existence of this combined hydrogen,\r\nwhich they have hitherto only done by conjectures founded upon\r\nsuppositions.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] This term _alloy_, which we have from the language of the arts,\r\nserves exceedingly well for distinguishing all the combinations or\r\nintimate unions of metals with each other, and is adopted in our new\r\nnomenclature for that purpose.--A.\r\n\r\n[23] By these are meant the supporters of the phlogistic theory, who at\r\npresent consider hydrogen, or the base of inflammable air, as the\r\nphlogiston of the celebrated Stahl.--E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n_Observations upon Oxyds and Acids with several Bases--and upon the\r\nComposition of Animal and Vegetable Substances._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have, in Chap. V. and VIII. examined the products resulting from the\r\ncombustion of the four simple combustible substances, sulphur,\r\nphosphorus, charcoal, and hydrogen: We have shown, in Chap. X that the\r\nsimple combustible substances are capable of combining with each other\r\ninto compound combustible substances, and have observed that oils in\r\ngeneral, and particularly the fixed vegetable oils, belong to this\r\nclass, being composed of hydrogen and charcoal. It remains, in this\r\nchapter, to treat of the oxygenation of these compound combustible\r\nsubstances, and to show that there exist acids and oxyds having double\r\nand triple bases. Nature furnishes us with numerous examples of this\r\nkind of combinations, by means of which, chiefly, she is enabled to\r\nproduce a vast variety of compounds from a very limited number of\r\nelements, or simple substances.\r\n\r\nIt was long ago well known, that, when muriatic and nitric acids were\r\nmixed together, a compound acid was formed, having properties quite\r\ndistinct from those of either of the acids taken separately. This acid\r\nwas called _aqua regia_, from its most celebrated property of dissolving\r\ngold, called _king of metals_ by the alchymists. Mr Berthollet has\r\ndistinctly proved that the peculiar properties of this acid arise from\r\nthe combined action of its two acidifiable bases; and for this reason we\r\nhave judged it necessary to distinguish it by an appropriate name: That\r\nof _nitro-muriatic_ acid appears extremely applicable, from its\r\nexpressing the nature of the two substances which enter into its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon of a double base in one acid, which had formerly been\r\nobserved only in the nitro-muriatic acid, occurs continually in the\r\nvegetable kingdom, in which a simple acid, or one possessed of a single\r\nacidifiable base, is very rarely found. Almost all the acids procurable\r\nfrom this kingdom have bases composed of charcoal and hydrogen, or of\r\ncharcoal, hydrogen, and phosphorus, combined with more or less oxygen.\r\nAll these bases, whether double or triple, are likewise formed into\r\noxyds, having less oxygen than is necessary to give them the properties\r\nof acids. The acids and oxyds from the animal kingdom are still more\r\ncompound, as their bases generally consist of a combination of\r\ncharcoal, phosphorus, hydrogen, and azote.\r\n\r\nAs it is but of late that I have acquired any clear and distinct notions\r\nof these substances, I shall not, in this place, enlarge much upon the\r\nsubject, which I mean to treat of very fully in some memoirs I am\r\npreparing to lay before the Academy. Most of my experiments are already\r\nperformed; but, to be able to give exact reports of the resulting\r\nquantities, it is necessary that they be carefully repeated, and\r\nincreased in number: Wherefore, I shall only give a short enumeration of\r\nthe vegetable and animal acids and oxyds, and terminate this article by\r\na few reflections upon the composition of vegetable and animal bodies.\r\n\r\nSugar, mucus, under which term we include the different kinds of gums,\r\nand starch, are vegetable oxyds, having hydrogen and charcoal combined,\r\nin different proportions, as their radicals or bases, and united with\r\noxygen, so as to bring them to the state of oxyds. From the state of\r\noxyds they are capable of being changed into acids by the addition of a\r\nfresh quantity of oxygen; and, according to the degrees of oxygenation,\r\nand the proportion of hydrogen and charcoal in their bases, they form\r\nthe several kinds of vegetable acids.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to apply the principles of our nomenclature to give\r\nnames to these vegetable acids and oxyds, by using the names of the two\r\nsubstances which compose their bases: They would thus become\r\nhydro-carbonous acids and oxyds: In this method we might indicate which\r\nof their elements existed in excess, without circumlocution, after the\r\nmanner used by Mr Rouelle for naming vegetable extracts: He calls these\r\nextracto-resinous when the extractive matter prevails in their\r\ncomposition, and resino-extractive when they contain a larger proportion\r\nof resinous matter. Upon that plan, and by varying the terminations\r\naccording to the formerly established rules of our nomenclature, we have\r\nthe following denominations: Hydro-carbonous, hydro-carbonic;\r\ncarbono-hydrous, and carbono-hydric oxyds. And for the acids:\r\nHydro-carbonous, hydro carbonic, oxygenated hydro-carbonic;\r\ncarbono-hydrous, carbono-hydric, and oxygenated carbono-hydric. It is\r\nprobable that the above terms would suffice for indicating all the\r\nvarieties in nature, and that, in proportion as the vegetable acids\r\nbecome well understood, they will naturally arrange themselves under\r\nthese denominations. But, though we know the elements of which these are\r\ncomposed, we are as yet ignorant of the proportions of these\r\ningredients, and are still far from being able to class them in the\r\nabove methodical manner; wherefore, we have determined to retain the\r\nancient names provisionally. I am somewhat farther advanced in this\r\ninquiry than at the time of publishing our conjunct essay upon chemical\r\nnomenclature; yet it would be improper to draw decided consequences from\r\nexperiments not yet sufficiently precise: Though I acknowledge that this\r\npart of chemistry still remains in some degree obscure, I must express\r\nmy expectations of its being very soon elucidated.\r\n\r\nI am still more forcibly necessitated to follow the same plan in naming\r\nthe acids, which have three or four elements combined in their bases; of\r\nthese we have a considerable number from the animal kingdom, and some\r\neven from vegetable substances. Azote, for instance, joined to hydrogen\r\nand charcoal, form the base or radical of the Prussic acid; we have\r\nreason to believe that the same happens with the base of the Gallic\r\nacid; and almost all the animal acids have their bases composed of\r\nazote, phosphorus, hydrogen, and charcoal. Were we to endeavour to\r\nexpress at once all these four component parts of the bases, our\r\nnomenclature would undoubtedly be methodical; it would have the property\r\nof being clear and determinate; but this assemblage of Greek and Latin\r\nsubstantives and adjectives, which are not yet universally admitted by\r\nchemists, would have the appearance of a barbarous language, difficult\r\nboth to pronounce and to be remembered. Besides, this part of chemistry\r\nbeing still far from that accuracy it must arrive to, the perfection of\r\nthe science ought certainly to precede that of its language; and we must\r\nstill, for some time, retain the old names for the animal oxyds and\r\nacids. We have only ventured to make a few slight modifications of these\r\nnames, by changing the termination into _ous_, when we have reason to\r\nsuppose the base to be in excess, and into _ic_, when we suspect the\r\noxygen predominates.\r\n\r\nThe following are all the vegetable acids hitherto known:\r\n\r\n    1. Acetous acid.\r\n    2. Acetic acid.\r\n    3. Oxalic acid.\r\n    4. Tartarous acid.\r\n    5. Pyro-tartarous acid.\r\n    6. Citric acid.\r\n    7. Malic acid.\r\n    8. Pyro-mucous acid.\r\n    9. Pyro-lignous acid.\r\n    10. Gallic acid.\r\n    11. Benzoic acid.\r\n    12. Camphoric acid.\r\n    13. Succinic acid.\r\n\r\nThough all these acids, as has been already said, are chiefly, and\r\nalmost entirely, composed of hydrogen, charcoal, and oxygen, yet,\r\nproperly speaking, they contain neither water carbonic acid nor oil, but\r\nonly the elements necessary for forming these substances. The power of\r\naffinity reciprocally exerted by the hydrogen, charcoal, and oxygen, in\r\nthese acids, is in a state of equilibrium only capable of existing in\r\nthe ordinary temperature of the atmosphere; for, when they are heated\r\nbut a very little above the temperature of boiling water, this\r\nequilibrium is destroyed, part of the oxygen and hydrogen unite, and\r\nform water; part of the charcoal and hydrogen combine into oil; part of\r\nthe charcoal and oxygen unite to form carbonic acid; and, lastly, there\r\ngenerally remains a small portion of charcoal, which, being in excess\r\nwith respect to the other ingredients, is left free. I mean to explain\r\nthis subject somewhat farther in the succeeding chapter.\r\n\r\nThe oxyds of the animal kingdom are hitherto less known than those from\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, and their number is as yet not at all determined.\r\nThe red part of the blood, lymph, and most of the secretions, are true\r\noxyds, under which point of view it is very important to consider them.\r\nWe are only acquainted with six animal acids, several of which, it is\r\nprobable, approach very near each other in their nature, or, at least,\r\ndiffer only in a scarcely sensible degree. I do not include the\r\nphosphoric acid amongst these, because it is found in all the kingdoms\r\nof nature. They are,\r\n\r\n    1. Lactic acid.\r\n    2. Saccholactic acid.\r\n    3. Bombic acid.\r\n    4. Formic acid.\r\n    5. Sebacic acid.\r\n    6. Prussic acid.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the constituent elements of the animal oxyds and\r\nacids is not more permanent than in those from the vegetable kingdom, as\r\na small increase of temperature is sufficient to overturn it. I hope to\r\nrender this subject more distinct than has been done hitherto in the\r\nfollowing chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Decomposition of Vegetable and Animal Substances by the Action\r\nof Fire._\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we can thoroughly comprehend what takes place during the\r\ndecomposition of vegetable substances by fire, we must take into\r\nconsideration the nature of the elements which enter into their\r\ncomposition, and the different affinities which the particles of these\r\nelements exert upon each other, and the affinity which caloric possesses\r\nwith them. The true constituent elements of vegetables are hydrogen,\r\noxygen, and charcoal: These are common to all vegetables, and no\r\nvegetable can exist without them: Such other substances as exist in\r\nparticular vegetables are only essential to the composition of those in\r\nwhich they are found, and do not belong to vegetables in general.\r\n\r\nOf these elements, hydrogen and oxygen have a strong tendency to unite\r\nwith caloric, and be converted into gas, whilst charcoal is a fixed\r\nelement, having but little affinity with caloric. On the other hand,\r\noxygen, which, in the usual temperature, tends nearly equally to unite\r\nwith hydrogen and with charcoal, has a much stronger affinity with\r\ncharcoal when at the red heat[24], and then unites with it to form\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are far from being able to appreciate all these powers of\r\naffinity, or to express their proportional energy by numbers, we are\r\ncertain, that, however variable they may be when considered in relation\r\nto the quantity of caloric with which they are combined, they are all\r\nnearly in equilibrium in the usual temperature of the atmosphere; hence\r\nvegetables neither contain oil[25], water, nor carbonic acid, tho' they\r\ncontain all the elements of these substances. The hydrogen is neither\r\ncombined with the oxygen nor with the charcoal, and reciprocally; the\r\nparticles of these three substances form a triple combination, which\r\nremains in equilibrium whilst undisturbed by caloric but a very slight\r\nincrease of temperature is sufficient to overturn this structure of\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nIf the increased temperature to which the vegetable is exposed does not\r\nexceed the heat of boiling water, one part of the hydrogen combines with\r\nthe oxygen, and forms water, the rest of the hydrogen combines with a\r\npart of the charcoal, and forms volatile oil, whilst the remainder of\r\nthe charcoal, being set free from its combination with the other\r\nelements, remains fixed in the bottom of the distilling vessel.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the contrary, we employ a red heat, no water is formed, or, at\r\nleast, any that may have been produced by the first application of the\r\nheat is decomposed, the oxygen having a greater affinity with the\r\ncharcoal at this degree of heat, combines with it to form carbonic acid,\r\nand the hydrogen being left free from combination with the other\r\nelements, unites with caloric, and escapes in the state of hydrogen gas.\r\nIn this high temperature, either no oil is formed, or, if any was\r\nproduced during the lower temperature at the beginning of the\r\nexperiment, it is decomposed by the action of the red heat. Thus the\r\ndecomposition of vegetable matter, under a high temperature, is produced\r\nby the action of double and triple affinities; while the charcoal\r\nattracts the oxygen, on purpose to form carbonic acid, the caloric\r\nattracts the hydrogen, and converts it into hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\nThe distillation of every species of vegetable substance confirms the\r\ntruth of this theory, if we can give that name to a simple relation of\r\nfacts. When sugar is submitted to distillation, so long as we only\r\nemploy a heat but a little below that of boiling water, it only loses\r\nits water of cristallization, it still remains sugar, and retains all\r\nits properties; but, immediately upon raising the heat only a little\r\nabove that degree, it becomes blackened, a part of the charcoal\r\nseparates from the combination, water slightly acidulated passes over\r\naccompanied by a little oil, and the charcoal which remains in the\r\nretort is nearly a third part of the original weight of the sugar.\r\n\r\nThe operation of affinities which take place during the decomposition,\r\nby fire, of vegetables which contain azote, such as the cruciferous\r\nplants, and of those containing phosphorus, is more complicated; but, as\r\nthese substances only enter into the composition of vegetables in very\r\nsmall quantities, they only, apparently, produce slight changes upon the\r\nproducts of distillation; the phosphorus seems to combine with the\r\ncharcoal, and, acquiring fixity from that union, remains behind in the\r\nretort, while the azote, combining with a part of the hydrogen, forms\r\nammoniac, or volatile alkali.\r\n\r\nAnimal substances, being composed nearly of the same elements with\r\ncruciferous plants, give the same products in distillation, with this\r\ndifference, that, as they contain a greater quantity of hydrogen and\r\nazote, they produce more oil and more ammoniac. I shall only produce one\r\nfact as a proof of the exactness with which this theory explains all the\r\nphenomena which occur during the distillation of animal substances,\r\nwhich is the rectification and total decomposition of volatile animal\r\noil, commonly known by the name of Dippel's oil. When these oils are\r\nprocured by a first distillation in a naked fire they are brown, from\r\ncontaining a little charcoal almost in a free state; but they become\r\nquite colourless by rectification. Even in this state the charcoal in\r\ntheir composition has so slight a connection with the other elements as\r\nto separate by mere exposure to the air. If we put a quantity of this\r\nanimal oil, well rectified, and consequently clear, limpid, and\r\ntransparent, into a bell-glass filled with oxygen gas over mercury, in a\r\nshort time the gas is much diminished, being absorbed by the oil, the\r\noxygen combining with the hydrogen of the oil forms water, which sinks\r\nto the bottom, at the same time the charcoal which was combined with the\r\nhydrogen being set free, manifests itself by rendering the oil black.\r\nHence the only way of preserving these oils colourless and transparent,\r\nis by keeping them in bottles perfectly full and accurately corked, to\r\nhinder the contact of air, which always discolours them.\r\n\r\nSuccessive rectifications of this oil furnish another phenomenon\r\nconfirming our theory. In each distillation a small quantity of charcoal\r\nremains in the retort, and a little water is formed by the union of the\r\noxygen contained in the air of the distilling vessels with the hydrogen\r\nof the oil. As this takes place in each successive distillation, if we\r\nmake use of large vessels and a considerable degree of heat, we at last\r\ndecompose the whole of the oil, and change it entirely into water and\r\ncharcoal. When we use small vessels, and especially when we employ a\r\nslow fire, or degree of heat little above that of boiling water, the\r\ntotal decomposition of these oils, by repeated distillation, is greatly\r\nmore tedious, and more difficultly accomplished. I shall give a\r\nparticular detail to the Academy, in a separate memoir, of all my\r\nexperiments upon the decomposition of oil; but what I have related above\r\nmay suffice to give just ideas of the composition of animal and\r\nvegetable substances, and of their decomposition by the action of fire.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Though this term, red heat, does not indicate any absolutely\r\ndeterminate degree of temperature, I shall use it sometimes to express a\r\ntemperature considerably above that of boiling water.--A.\r\n\r\n[25] I must be understood here to speak of vegetables reduced to a\r\nperfectly dry state; and, with respect to oil, I do not mean that which\r\nis procured by expression either in the cold, or in a temperature not\r\nexceeding that of boiling water; I only allude to the empyreumatic oil\r\nprocured by distillation with a naked fire, in a heat superior to the\r\ntemperature of boiling water; which is the only oil declared to be\r\nproduced by the operation of fire. What I have published upon this\r\nsubject in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1786 may be consulted.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Decomposition of Vegetable Oxyds by the Vinous Fermentation._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner in which wine, cyder, mead, and all the liquors formed by the\r\nspiritous fermentation, are produced, is well known to every one. The\r\njuice of grapes or of apples being expressed, and the latter being\r\ndiluted with water, they are put into large vats, which are kept in a\r\ntemperature of at least 10° (54.5°) of the thermometer. A rapid\r\nintestine motion, or fermentation, very soon takes place, numerous\r\nglobules of gas form in the liquid and burst at the surface; when the\r\nfermentation is at its height, the quantity of gas disengaged is so\r\ngreat as to make the liquor appear as if boiling violently over a fire.\r\nWhen this gas is carefully gathered, it is found to be carbonic acid\r\nperfectly pure, and free from admixture with any other species of air or\r\ngas whatever.\r\n\r\nWhen the fermentation is completed, the juice of grapes is changed from\r\nbeing sweet, and full of sugar, into a vinous liquor which no longer\r\ncontains any sugar, and from which we procure, by distillation, an\r\ninflammable liquor, known in commerce under the name of Spirit of Wine.\r\nAs this liquor is produced by the fermentation of any saccharine matter\r\nwhatever diluted with water, it must have been contrary to the\r\nprinciples of our nomenclature to call it spirit of wine rather than\r\nspirit of cyder, or of fermented sugar; wherefore, we have adopted a\r\nmore general term, and the Arabic word _alkohol_ seems extremely proper\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nThis operation is one of the most extraordinary in chemistry: We must\r\nexamine whence proceed the disengaged carbonic acid and the inflammable\r\nliquor produced, and in what manner a sweet vegetable oxyd becomes thus\r\nconverted into two such opposite substances, whereof one is combustible,\r\nand the other eminently the contrary. To solve these two questions, it\r\nis necessary to be previously acquainted with the analysis of the\r\nfermentable substance, and of the products of the fermentation. We may\r\nlay it down as an incontestible axiom, that, in all the operations of\r\nart and nature, nothing is created; an equal quantity of matter exists\r\nboth before and after the experiment; the quality and quantity of the\r\nelements remain precisely the same; and nothing takes place beyond\r\nchanges and modifications in the combination of these elements. Upon\r\nthis principle the whole art of performing chemical experiments\r\ndepends: We must always suppose an exact equality between the elements\r\nof the body examined and those of the products of its analysis.\r\n\r\nHence, since from must of grapes we procure alkohol and carbonic acid, I\r\nhave an undoubted right to suppose that must consists of carbonic acid\r\nand alkohol. From these premises, we have two methods of ascertaining\r\nwhat passes during vinous fermentation, by determining the nature of,\r\nand the elements which compose, the fermentable substances, or by\r\naccurately examining the produces resulting from fermentation; and it is\r\nevident that the knowledge of either of these must lead to accurate\r\nconclusions concerning the nature and composition of the other. From\r\nthese considerations, it became necessary accurately to determine the\r\nconstituent elements of the fermentable substances; and, for this\r\npurpose, I did not make use of the compound juices of fruits, the\r\nrigorous analysis of which is perhaps impossible, but made choice of\r\nsugar, which is easily analysed, and the nature of which I have already\r\nexplained. This substance is a true vegetable oxyd with two bases,\r\ncomposed of hydrogen and charcoal brought to the state of an oxyd, by a\r\ncertain proportion of oxygen; and these three elements are combined in\r\nsuch a way, that a very slight force is sufficient to destroy the\r\nequilibrium of their connection. By a long train of experiments, made\r\nin various ways, and often repeated, I ascertained that the proportion\r\nin which these ingredients exist in sugar, are nearly eight parts of\r\nhydrogen, 64 parts of oxygen, and 28 parts of charcoal, all by weight,\r\nforming 100 parts of sugar.\r\n\r\nSugar must be mixed with about four times its weight of water, to render\r\nit susceptible of fermentation; and even then the equilibrium of its\r\nelements would remain undisturbed, without the assistance of some\r\nsubstance, to give a commencement to the fermentation. This is\r\naccomplished by means of a little yeast from beer; and, when the\r\nfermentation is once excited, it continues of itself until completed. I\r\nshall, in another place, give an account of the effects of yeast, and\r\nother ferments, upon fermentable substances. I have usually employed 10\r\nlibs. of yeast, in the state of paste, for each 100 libs. of sugar,\r\nwith as much water as is four times the weight of the sugar. I shall\r\ngive the results of my experiments exactly as they were obtained,\r\npreserving even the fractions produced by calculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.  _Materials of Fermentation._\r\n\r\n                                     libs.    oz.  gros   grs.\r\nWater                                  400     0     0      0\r\nSugar                                  100     0     0      0\r\nYeast in paste, 10 libs.   { Water       7     3     6     44\r\ncomposed of                { Dry yeast   2    12     1     28\r\n                                       ----------------------\r\n                               Total   510\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II. _Constituent Elements of the Materials of Fermentation._\r\n\r\n                                                    libs.   oz. gros    grs.\r\n\r\n407 libs. 3 oz. 6 gros 44 grs.           { Hydrogen   61     1     2    71.40\r\nof water, composed of                    { Oxygen    346     2     3    44.60\r\n\r\n                                         { Hydrogen    8     0     0     0\r\n100 libs. sugar, composed of             { Oxygen     64     0     0     0\r\n                                         { Charcoal   28     0     0     0\r\n\r\n                                         { Hydrogen    0     4     5     9.30\r\n2 libs. 12 oz. 1 gros 28 grs. of         { Oxygen      1    10     2    28.76\r\ndry yeast, composed of                   { Charcoal    0    12     4    59\r\n                                         { Azote       0     0     5     2.94\r\n                                                     -----------------------\r\n                                      Total weight   510     0     0     0\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III. _Recapitulation of these Elements._\r\n\r\n                   libs.     oz.   gros  grs.\r\nOxygen:\r\n  of the water       340      0      0    0    }\r\n  of the water                                 } libs.   oz.    gros   grs.\r\n    in the yeast       6      2      3   44.60 }   411    12      6    1.36\r\n  of the sugar        64      0      0    0    }\r\n  of the dry yeast     1     10      2   28.76 }\r\nHydrogen:\r\n  of the water        60      0      0    0    }\r\n  of the water                                 }\r\n  in the yeast         1      1      2   71.40 }    69     6      0    8.70\r\n  of the sugar         8      0      0    0    }\r\n  of the dry yeast     0      4      5    9.30 }\r\nCharcoal:\r\n  of the sugar        28      0      0    0    }\r\n  of the yeast         0     12      4   59.00 }    28    12      4   59.00\r\nAzote of the yeast     -      -      -    -    }     0     0      5    2.94\r\n                                                 --------------------------\r\n                                           In all  510     0      0    0\r\n\r\nHaving thus accurately determined the nature and quantity of the\r\nconstituent elements of the materials submitted to fermentation, we have\r\nnext to examine the products resulting from that process. For this\r\npurpose, I placed the above 510 libs. of fermentable liquor in a\r\nproper[26] apparatus, by means of which I could accurately determine the\r\nquantity and quality of gas disengaged during the fermentation, and\r\ncould even weigh every one of the products separately, at any period of\r\nthe process I judged proper. An hour or two after the substances are\r\nmixed together, especially if they are kept in a temperature of from 15°\r\n(65.75°) to 18° (72.5°) of the thermometer, the first marks of\r\nfermentation commence; the liquor turns thick and frothy, little\r\nglobules of air are disengaged, which rise and burst at the surface; the\r\nquantity of these globules quickly increases, and there is a rapid and\r\nabundant production of very pure carbonic acid, accompanied with a scum,\r\nwhich is the yeast separating from the mixture. After some days, less or\r\nmore according to the degree of heat, the intestine motion and\r\ndisengagement of gas diminish; but these do not cease entirely, nor is\r\nthe fermentation completed for a considerable time. During the process,\r\n35 libs. 5 oz. 4 gros 19 grs. of dry carbonic acid are\r\ndisengaged, which carry alongst with them 13 libs. 14 oz. 5 gros\r\nof water.

In the\r\nfirst place, out of the 100 libs. of sugar employed, 4 libs. 1 oz.\r\n4 gros 3 grs. remain, without having suffered decomposition; so\r\nthat, in reality, we have only operated upon 95 libs. 14 oz. 3\r\ngros 69 grs. of sugar; that is to say, upon 61 libs. 6 oz. 45\r\ngrs. of oxygen, 7 libs. 10 oz. 6 gros 6 grs. of hydrogen, and\r\n26 libs. 13 oz. 5 gros 19 grs. of charcoal. By comparing these\r\nquantities, we find that they are fully sufficient for forming the whole\r\nof the alkohol, carbonic acid and acetous acid produced by the\r\nfermentation. It is not, therefore, necessary to suppose that any water\r\nhas been decomposed during the experiment, unless it be pretended that\r\nthe oxygen and hydrogen exist in the sugar in that state. On the\r\ncontrary, I have already made it evident that hydrogen, oxygen and\r\ncharcoal, the three constituent elements of vegetables, remain in a\r\nstate of equilibrium or mutual union with each other which subsists so\r\nlong as this union remains undisturbed by increased temperature, or by\r\nsome new compound attraction; and that then only these elements\r\ncombine, two and two together, to form water and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the vinous fermentation upon sugar is thus reduced to the\r\nmere separation of its elements into two portions; one part is\r\noxygenated at the expence of the other, so as to form carbonic acid,\r\nwhilst the other part, being deoxygenated in favour of the former, is\r\nconverted into the combustible substance alkohol; therefore, if it were\r\npossible to reunite alkohol and carbonic acid together, we ought to form\r\nsugar. It is evident that the charcoal and hydrogen in the alkohol do\r\nnot exist in the state of oil, they are combined with a portion of\r\noxygen, which renders them miscible with water; wherefore these three\r\nsubstances, oxygen, hydrogen, and charcoal, exist here likewise in a\r\nspecies of equilibrium or reciprocal combination; and in fact, when they\r\nare made to pass through a red hot tube of glass or porcelain, this\r\nunion or equilibrium is destroyed, the elements become combined, two and\r\ntwo, and water and carbonic acid are formed.\r\n\r\nI had formally advanced, in my first Memoirs upon the formation of\r\nwater, that it was decomposed in a great number of chemical experiments,\r\nand particularly during the vinous fermentation. I then supposed that\r\nwater existed ready formed in sugar, though I am now convinced that\r\nsugar only contains the elements proper for composing it. It may be\r\nreadily conceived, that it must have cost me a good deal to abandon my\r\nfirst notions, but by several years reflection, and after a great number\r\nof experiments and observations upon vegetable substances, I have fixed\r\nmy ideas as above.\r\n\r\nI shall finish what I have to say upon vinous fermentation, by\r\nobserving, that it furnishes us with the means of analysing sugar and\r\nevery vegetable fermentable matter. We may consider the substances\r\nsubmitted to fermentation, and the products resulting from that\r\noperation, as forming an algebraic equation; and, by successively\r\nsupposing each of the elements in this equation unknown, we can\r\ncalculate their values in succession, and thus verify our experiments by\r\ncalculation, and our calculation by experiment reciprocally. I have\r\noften successfully employed this method for correcting the first results\r\nof my experiments, and to direct me in the proper road for repeating\r\nthem to advantage. I have explained myself at large upon this subject,\r\nin a Memoir upon vinous fermentation already presented to the Academy,\r\nand which will speedily be published.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] The above apparatus is described in the Third Part.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\n_Of the Putrefactive Fermentation._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of putrefaction are caused, like those of vinous\r\nfermentation, by the operation of very complicated affinities. The\r\nconstituent elements of the bodies submitted to this process cease to\r\ncontinue in equilibrium in the threefold combination, and form\r\nthemselves anew into binary combinations[27], or compounds, consisting\r\nof two elements only; but these are entirely different from the results\r\nproduced by the vinous fermentation. Instead of one part of the hydrogen\r\nremaining united with part of the water and charcoal to form alkohol, as\r\nin the vinous fermentation, the whole of the hydrogen is dissipated,\r\nduring putrefaction, in the form of hydrogen gas, whilst, at the same\r\ntime, the oxygen and charcoal, uniting with caloric, escape in the form\r\nof carbonic acid gas; so that, when the whole process is finished,\r\nespecially if the materials have been mixed with a sufficient quantity\r\nof water, nothing remains but the earth of the vegetable mixed with a\r\nsmall portion of charcoal and iron. Thus putrefaction is nothing more\r\nthan a complete analysis of vegetable substance, during which the whole\r\nof the constituent elements is disengaged in form of gas, except the\r\nearth, which remains in the state of mould[28].\r\n\r\nSuch is the result of putrefaction when the substances submitted to it\r\ncontain only oxygen, hydrogen, charcoal and a little earth. But this\r\ncase is rare, and these substances putrify imperfectly and with\r\ndifficulty, and require a considerable time to complete their\r\nputrefaction. It is otherwise with substances containing azote, which\r\nindeed exists in all animal matters, and even in a considerable number\r\nof vegetable substances. This additional element is remarkably\r\nfavourable to putrefaction; and for this reason animal matter is mixed\r\nwith vegetable, when the putrefaction of these is wished to be hastened.\r\nThe whole art of forming composts and dunghills, for the purposes of\r\nagriculture, consists in the proper application of this admixture.\r\n\r\nThe addition of azote to the materials of putrefaction not only\r\naccelerates the process, that element likewise combines with part of\r\nthe hydrogen, and forms a new substance called _volatile alkali_ or\r\n_ammoniac_. The results obtained by analysing animal matters, by\r\ndifferent processes, leave no room for doubt with regard to the\r\nconstituent elements of ammoniac; whenever the azote has been previously\r\nseparated from these substances, no ammoniac is produced; and in all\r\ncases they furnish ammoniac only in proportion to the azote they\r\ncontain. This composition of ammoniac is likewise fully proved by Mr\r\nBerthollet, in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1785, p. 316. where he\r\ngives a variety of analytical processes by which ammoniac is decomposed,\r\nand its two elements, azote and hydrogen, procured separately.\r\n\r\nI already mentioned in Chap. X. that almost all combustible bodies were\r\ncapable of combining with each other; hydrogen gas possesses this\r\nquality in an eminent degree, it dissolves charcoal, sulphur, and\r\nphosphorus, producing the compounds named _carbonated hydrogen gas_,\r\n_sulphurated hydrogen gas_, and _phosphorated hydrogen gas_. The two\r\nlatter of these gasses have a peculiarly disagreeable flavour; the\r\nsulphurated hydrogen gas has a strong resemblance to the smell of rotten\r\neggs, and the phosphorated smells exactly like putrid fish. Ammoniac has\r\nlikewise a peculiar odour, not less penetrating, or less disagreeable,\r\nthan these other gasses. From the mixture of these different flavours\r\nproceeds the fetor which accompanies the putrefaction of animal\r\nsubstances. Sometimes ammoniac predominates, which is easily perceived\r\nby its sharpness upon the eyes; sometimes, as in feculent matters, the\r\nsulphurated gas is most prevalent; and sometimes, as in putrid herrings,\r\nthe phosphorated hydrogen gas is most abundant.\r\n\r\nI long supposed that nothing could derange or interrupt the course of\r\nputrefaction; but Mr Fourcroy and Mr Thouret have observed some peculiar\r\nphenomena in dead bodies, buried at a certain depth, and preserved to a\r\ncertain degree, from contact with air; having found the muscular flesh\r\nfrequently converted into true animal fat. This must have arisen from\r\nthe disengagement of the azote, naturally contained in the animal\r\nsubstance, by some unknown cause, leaving only the hydrogen and charcoal\r\nremaining, which are the elements proper for producing fat or oil. This\r\nobservation upon the possibility of converting animal substances into\r\nfat may some time or other lead to discoveries of great importance to\r\nsociety. The faeces of animals, and other excrementitious matters, are\r\nchiefly composed of charcoal and hydrogen, and approach considerably to\r\nthe nature of oil, of which they furnish a considerable quantity by\r\ndistillation with a naked fire; but the intolerable foetor which\r\naccompanies all the products of these substances prevents our expecting\r\nthat, at least for a long time, they can be rendered useful in any other\r\nway than as manures.\r\n\r\nI have only given conjectural approximations in this Chapter upon the\r\ncomposition of animal substances, which is hitherto but imperfectly\r\nunderstood. We know that they are composed of hydrogen, charcoal, azote,\r\nphosphorus, and sulphur, all of which, in a state of quintuple\r\ncombination, are brought to the state of oxyd by a larger or smaller\r\nquantity of oxygen. We are, however, still unacquainted with the\r\nproportions in which these substances are combined, and must leave it to\r\ntime to complete this part of chemical analysis, as it has already done\r\nwith several others.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] Binary combinations are such as consist of two simple elements\r\ncombined together. Ternary, and quaternary, consist of three and four\r\nelements.--E.\r\n\r\n[28] In the Third Part will be given the description of an apparatus\r\nproper for being used in experiments of this kind.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\n_Of the Acetous Fermentation._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acetous fermentation is nothing more than the acidification or\r\noxygenation of wine[29], produced in the open air by means of the\r\nabsorption of oxygen. The resulting acid is the acetous acid, commonly\r\ncalled Vinegar, which is composed of hydrogen and charcoal united\r\ntogether in proportions not yet ascertained, and changed into the acid\r\nstate by oxygen. As vinegar is an acid, we might conclude from analogy\r\nthat it contains oxygen, but this is put beyond doubt by direct\r\nexperiments: In the first place, we cannot change wine into vinegar\r\nwithout the contact of air containing oxygen; secondly, this process is\r\naccompanied by a diminution of the volume of the air in which it is\r\ncarried on from the absorption of its oxygen; and, thirdly, wine may be\r\nchanged into vinegar by any other means of oxygenation.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the proofs which these facts furnish of the acetous acid\r\nbeing produced by the oxygenation of wine, an experiment made by Mr\r\nChaptal, Professor of Chemistry at Montpellier, gives us a distinct view\r\nof what takes place in this process. He impregnated water with about its\r\nown bulk of carbonic acid from fermenting beer, and placed this water in\r\na cellar in vessels communicating with the air, and in a short time the\r\nwhole was converted into acetous acid. The carbonic acid gas procured\r\nfrom beer vats in fermentation is not perfectly pure, but contains a\r\nsmall quantity of alkohol in solution, wherefore water impregnated with\r\nit contains all the materials necessary for forming the acetous acid.\r\nThe alkohol furnishes hydrogen and one portion of charcoal, the carbonic\r\nacid furnishes oxygen and the rest of the charcoal, and the air of the\r\natmosphere furnishes the rest of the oxygen necessary for changing the\r\nmixture into acetous acid. From this observation it follows, that\r\nnothing but hydrogen is wanting to convert carbonic acid into acetous\r\nacid; or more generally, that, by means of hydrogen, and according to\r\nthe degree of oxygenation, carbonic acid may be changed into all the\r\nvegetable acids; and, on the contrary, that, by depriving any of the\r\nvegetable acids of their hydrogen, they may be converted into carbonic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nAlthough the principal facts relating to the acetous acid are well\r\nknown, yet numerical exactitude is still wanting, till furnished by more\r\nexact experiments than any hitherto performed; wherefore I shall not\r\nenlarge any farther upon the subject. It is sufficiently shown by what\r\nhas been said, that the constitution of all the vegetable acids and\r\noxyds is exactly conformable to the formation of vinegar; but farther\r\nexperiments are necessary to teach us the proportion of the constituent\r\nelements in all these acids and oxyds. We may easily perceive, however,\r\nthat this part of chemistry, like all the rest of its divisions, makes\r\nrapid progress towards perfection, and that it is already rendered\r\ngreatly more simple than was formerly believed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] The word Wine, in this chapter, is used to signify the liquor\r\nproduced by the vinous fermentation, whatever vegetable substance may\r\nhave been used for obtaining it.--E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\n_Of the Formation of Neutral Salts, and of their different Bases._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that all the oxyds and acids from the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms are formed by means of a small number of simple\r\nelements, or at least of such as have not hitherto been susceptible of\r\ndecomposition, by means of combination with oxygen; these are azote,\r\nsulphur, phosphorus, charcoal, hydrogen, and the muriatic radical[30].\r\nWe may justly admire the simplicity of the means employed by nature to\r\nmultiply qualities and forms, whether by combining three or four\r\nacidifiable bases in different proportions, or by altering the dose of\r\noxygen employed for oxydating or acidifying them. We shall find the\r\nmeans no less simple and diversified, and as abundantly productive of\r\nforms and qualities, in the order of bodies we are now about to treat\r\nof.\r\n\r\nAcidifiable substances, by combining with oxygen, and their consequent\r\nconversion into acids, acquire great susceptibility of farther\r\ncombination; they become capable of uniting with earthy and metallic\r\nbodies, by which means neutral salts are formed. Acids may therefore be\r\nconsidered as true _salifying_ principles, and the substances with which\r\nthey unite to form neutral salts may be called _salifiable_ bases: The\r\nnature of the union which these two principles form with each other is\r\nmeant as the subject of the present chapter.\r\n\r\nThis view of the acids prevents me from considering them as salts,\r\nthough they are possessed of many of the principal properties of saline\r\nbodies, as solubility in water, &c. I have already observed that they\r\nare the result of a first order of combination, being composed of two\r\nsimple elements, or at least of elements which act as if they were\r\nsimple, and we may therefore rank them, to use the language of Stahl, in\r\nthe order of _mixts_. The neutral salts, on the contrary, are of a\r\nsecondary order of combination, being formed by the union of two _mixts_\r\nwith each other, and may therefore be termed _compounds_. Hence I shall\r\nnot arrange the alkalies[31] or earths in the class of salts, to which\r\nI allot only such as are composed of an oxygenated substance united to\r\na base.\r\n\r\nI have already enlarged sufficiently upon the formation of acids in the\r\npreceding chapter, and shall not add any thing farther upon that\r\nsubject; but having as yet given no account of the salifiable bases\r\nwhich are capable of uniting with them to form neutral salts, I mean, in\r\nthis chapter, to give an account of the nature and origin of each of\r\nthese bases. These are potash, soda, ammoniac, lime, magnesia, barytes,\r\nargill[32], and all the metallic bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _Of Potash._\r\n\r\nWe have already shown, that, when a vegetable substance is submitted to\r\nthe action of fire in distilling vessels, its component elements,\r\noxygen, hydrogen, and charcoal, which formed a threefold combination in\r\na state of equilibrium, unite, two and two, in obedience to affinities\r\nwhich act conformable to the degree of heat employed. Thus, at the\r\nfirst application of the fire, whenever the heat produced exceeds the\r\ntemperature of boiling water, part of the oxygen and hydrogen unite to\r\nform water; soon after the rest of the hydrogen, and part of the\r\ncharcoal, combine into oil; and, lastly, when the fire is pushed to the\r\nred heat, the oil and water, which had been formed in the early part of\r\nthe process, become again decomposed, the oxygen and charcoal unite to\r\nform carbonic acid, a large quantity of hydrogen gas is set free, and\r\nnothing but charcoal remains in the retort.\r\n\r\nA great part of these phenomena occur during the combustion of\r\nvegetables in the open air; but, in this case, the presence of the air\r\nintroduces three new substances, the oxygen and azote of the air and\r\ncaloric, of which two at least produce considerable changes in the\r\nresults of the operation. In proportion as the hydrogen of the\r\nvegetable, or that which results from the decomposition of the water, is\r\nforced out in the form of hydrogen gas by the progress of the fire, it\r\nis set on fire immediately upon getting in contact with the air, water\r\nis again formed, and the greater part of the caloric of the two gasses\r\nbecoming free produces flame. When all the hydrogen gas is driven out,\r\nburnt, and again reduced to water, the remaining charcoal continues to\r\nburn, but without flame; it is formed into carbonic acid, which carries\r\noff a portion of caloric sufficient to give it the gasseous form; the\r\nrest of the caloric, from the oxygen of the air, being set free,\r\nproduces the heat and light observed during the combustion of charcoal.\r\nThe whole vegetable is thus reduced into water and carbonic acid, and\r\nnothing remains but a small portion of gray earthy matter called ashes,\r\nbeing the only really fixed principles which enter into the constitution\r\nof vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe earth, or rather ashes, which seldom exceeds a twentieth part of the\r\nweight of the vegetable, contains a substance of a particular nature,\r\nknown under the name of fixed vegetable alkali, or potash. To obtain it,\r\nwater is poured upon the ashes, which dissolves the potash, and leaves\r\nthe ashes which are insoluble; by afterwards evaporating the water, we\r\nobtain the potash in a white concrete form: It is very fixed even in a\r\nvery high degree of heat. I do not mean here to describe the art of\r\npreparing potash, or the method of procuring it in a state of purity,\r\nbut have entered upon the above detail that I might not use any word not\r\npreviously explained.\r\n\r\nThe potash obtained by this process is always less or more saturated\r\nwith carbonic acid, which is easily accounted for: As the potash does\r\nnot form, or at least is not set free, but in proportion as the\r\ncharcoal of the vegetable is converted into carbonic acid by the\r\naddition of oxygen, either from the air or the water, it follows, that\r\neach particle of potash, at the instant of its formation, or at least of\r\nits liberation, is in contact with a particle of carbonic acid, and, as\r\nthere is a considerable affinity between these two substances, they\r\nnaturally combine together. Although the carbonic acid has less affinity\r\nwith potash than any other acid, yet it is difficult to separate the\r\nlast portions from it. The most usual method of accomplishing this is to\r\ndissolve the potash in water; to this solution add two or three times\r\nits weight of quick-lime, then filtrate the liquor and evaporate it in\r\nclose vessels; the saline substance left by the evaporation is potash\r\nalmost entirely deprived of carbonic acid. In this state it is soluble\r\nin an equal weight of water, and even attracts the moisture of the air\r\nwith great avidity; by this property it furnishes us with an excellent\r\nmeans of rendering air or gas dry by exposing them to its action. In\r\nthis state it is soluble in alkohol, though not when combined with\r\ncarbonic acid; and Mr Berthollet employs this property as a method of\r\nprocuring potash in the state of perfect purity.\r\n\r\nAll vegetables yield less or more of potash in consequence of\r\ncombustion, but it is furnished in various degrees of purity by\r\ndifferent vegetables; usually, indeed, from all of them it is mixed\r\nwith different salts from which it is easily separable. We can hardly\r\nentertain a doubt that the ashes, or earth which is left by vegetables\r\nin combustion, pre-existed in them before they were burnt, forming what\r\nmay be called the skeleton, or osseous part of the vegetable. But it is\r\nquite otherwise with potash; this substance has never yet been procured\r\nfrom vegetables but by means of processes or intermedia capable of\r\nfurnishing oxygen and azote, such as combustion, or by means of nitric\r\nacid; so that it is not yet demonstrated that potash may not be a\r\nproduce from these operations. I have begun a series of experiments upon\r\nthis object, and hope soon to be able to give an account of their\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _Of Soda._\r\n\r\nSoda, like potash, is an alkali procured by lixiviation from the ashes\r\nof burnt plants, but only from those which grow upon the sea-side, and\r\nespecially from the herb _kali_, whence is derived the name _alkali_,\r\ngiven to this substance by the Arabians. It has some properties in\r\ncommon with potash, and others which are entirely different: In general,\r\nthese two substances have peculiar characters in their saline\r\ncombinations which are proper to each, and consequently distinguish them\r\nfrom each other; thus soda, which, as obtained from marine plants, is\r\nusually entirely saturated with carbonic acid, does not attract the\r\nhumidity of the atmosphere like potash, but, on the contrary,\r\ndesiccates, its cristals effloresce, and are converted into a white\r\npowder having all the properties of soda, which it really is, having\r\nonly lost its water of cristallization.\r\n\r\nHitherto we are not better acquainted with the constituent elements of\r\nsoda than with those of potash, being equally uncertain whether it\r\npreviously existed ready formed in the vegetable or is a combination of\r\nelements effected by combustion. Analogy leads us to suspect that azote\r\nis a constituent element of all the alkalies, as is the case with\r\nammoniac; but we have only slight presumptions, unconfirmed by any\r\ndecisive experiments, respecting the composition of potash and soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _Of Ammoniac._\r\n\r\nWe have, however, very accurate knowledge of the composition of\r\nammoniac, or volatile alkali, as it is called by the old chemists. Mr\r\nBerthollet, in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1784, p. 316. has proved\r\nby analysis, that 1000 parts of this substance consist of about 807\r\nparts of azote combined with 193 parts of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nAmmoniac is chiefly procurable from animal substances by distillation,\r\nduring which process the azote and hydrogen necessary to its formation\r\nunite in proper proportions; it is not, however, procured pure by this\r\nprocess, being mixed with oil and water, and mostly saturated with\r\ncarbonic acid. To separate these substances it is first combined with an\r\nacid, the muriatic for instance, and then disengaged from that\r\ncombination by the addition of lime or potash. When ammoniac is thus\r\nproduced in its greatest degree of purity it can only exist under the\r\ngasseous form, at least in the usual temperature of the atmosphere, it\r\nhas an excessively penetrating smell, is absorbed in large quantities by\r\nwater, especially if cold and assisted by compression. Water thus\r\nsaturated with ammoniac has usually been termed volatile alkaline fluor;\r\nwe shall call it either simply ammoniac, or liquid ammoniac, and\r\nammoniacal gas when it exists in the aëriform state.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. _Of Lime, Magnesia, Barytes, and Argill._\r\n\r\nThe composition of these four earths is totally unknown, and, until by\r\nnew discoveries their constituent elements are ascertained, we are\r\ncertainly authorised to consider them as simple bodies. Art has no share\r\nin the production of these earths, as they are all procured ready\r\nformed from nature; but, as they have all, especially the three first,\r\ngreat tendency to combination, they are never found pure. Lime is\r\nusually saturated with carbonic acid in the state of chalk, calcarious\r\nspars, most of the marbles, &c.; sometimes with sulphuric acid, as in\r\ngypsum and plaster stones; at other times with fluoric acid forming\r\nvitreous or fluor spars; and, lastly, it is found in the waters of the\r\nsea, and of saline springs, combined with muriatic acid. Of all the\r\nsalifiable bases it is the most universally spread through nature.\r\n\r\nMagnesia is found in mineral waters, for the most part combined with\r\nsulphuric acid; it is likewise abundant in sea-water, united with\r\nmuriatic acid; and it exists in a great number of stones of different\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nBarytes is much less common than the three preceding earths; it is found\r\nin the mineral kingdom, combined with sulphuric acid, forming heavy\r\nspars, and sometimes, though rarely, united to carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nArgill, or the base of alum, having less tendency to combination than\r\nthe other earths, is often found in the state of argill, uncombined with\r\nany acid. It is chiefly procurable from clays, of which, properly\r\nspeaking, it is the base, or chief ingredient.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _Of Metallic Bodies._\r\n\r\nThe metals, except gold, and sometimes silver, are rarely found in the\r\nmineral kingdom in their metallic state, being usually less or more\r\nsaturated with oxygen, or combined with sulphur, arsenic, sulphuric\r\nacid, muriatic acid, carbonic acid, or phosphoric acid. Metallurgy, or\r\nthe docimastic art, teaches the means of separating them from these\r\nforeign matters; and for this purpose we refer to such chemical books as\r\ntreat upon these operations.\r\n\r\nWe are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic\r\nsubstances existing in nature, as all those which have a stronger\r\naffinity to oxygen, than charcoal possesses, are incapable of being\r\nreduced to the metallic state, and, consequently, being only presented\r\nto our observation under the form of oxyds, are confounded with earths.\r\nIt is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged\r\nwith earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits\r\nproperties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies. It is even\r\npossible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic\r\noxyds, irreducible by any hitherto known process.\r\n\r\nThose metallic bodies we are at present acquainted with, and which we\r\ncan reduce to the metallic or reguline state, are the following\r\nseventeen:\r\n\r\n    1. Arsenic.\r\n    2. Molybdena.\r\n    3. Tungstein.\r\n    4. Manganese.\r\n    5. Nickel.\r\n    6. Cobalt.\r\n    7. Bismuth.\r\n    8. Antimony.\r\n    9. Zinc.\r\n    10. Iron.\r\n    11. Tin.\r\n    12. Lead.\r\n    13. Copper.\r\n    14. Mercury.\r\n    15. Silver.\r\n    16. Platina.\r\n    17. Gold.\r\n\r\nI only mean to consider these as salifiable bases, without entering at\r\nall upon the consideration of their properties in the arts, and for the\r\nuses of society. In these points of view each metal would require a\r\ncomplete treatise, which would lead me far beyond the bounds I have\r\nprescribed for this work.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] I have not ventured to omit this element, as here enumerated with\r\nthe other principles of animal and vegetable substances, though it is\r\nnot at all taken notice of in the preceding chapters as entering into\r\nthe composition of these bodies.--E.\r\n\r\n[31] Perhaps my thus rejecting the alkalies from the class of salts may\r\nbe considered as a capital defect in the method I have adopted, and I am\r\nready to admit the charge; but this inconvenience is compensated by so\r\nmany advantages, that I could not think it of sufficient consequence to\r\nmake me alter my plan.--A.\r\n\r\n[32] Called Alumine by Mr Lavoisier; but as Argill has been in a manner\r\nnaturalized to the language for this substance by Mr Kirwan, I have\r\nventured to use it in preference.--E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\n_Continuation of the Observations upon Salifiable Bases, and the\r\nFormation of Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to remark, that earths and alkalies unite with acids to\r\nform neutral salts without the intervention of any medium, whereas\r\nmetallic substances are incapable of forming this combination without\r\nbeing previously less or more oxygenated; strictly speaking, therefore,\r\nmetals are not soluble in acids, but only metallic oxyds. Hence, when we\r\nput a metal into an acid for solution, it is necessary, in the first\r\nplace, that it become oxygenated, either by attracting oxygen from the\r\nacid or from the water; or, in other words, that a metal cannot be\r\ndissolved in an acid unless the oxygen, either of the acid, or of the\r\nwater mixed with it, has a stronger affinity to the metal than to the\r\nhydrogen or the acidifiable base; or, what amounts to the same thing,\r\nthat no metallic solution can take place without a previous\r\ndecomposition of the water, or the acid in which it is made. The\r\nexplanation of the principal phenomena of metallic solution depends\r\nentirely upon this simple observation, which was overlooked even by the\r\nillustrious Bergman.\r\n\r\nThe first and most striking of these is the effervescence, or, to speak\r\nless equivocally, the disengagement of gas which takes place during the\r\nsolution; in the solutions made in nitric acid this effervescence is\r\nproduced by the disengagement of nitrous gas; in solutions with\r\nsulphuric acid it is either sulphurous acid gas or hydrogen gas,\r\naccording as the oxydation of the metal happens to be made at the\r\nexpence of the sulphuric acid or of the water. As both nitric acid and\r\nwater are composed of elements which, when separate, can only exist in\r\nthe gasseous form, at least in the common temperature of the atmosphere,\r\nit is evident that, whenever either of these is deprived of its oxygen,\r\nthe remaining element must instantly expand and assume the state of gas;\r\nthe effervescence is occasioned by this sudden conversion from the\r\nliquid to the gasseous state. The same decomposition, and consequent\r\nformation of gas, takes place when solutions of metals are made in\r\nsulphuric acid: In general, especially by the humid way, metals do not\r\nattract all the oxygen it contains; they therefore reduce it, not into\r\nsulphur, but into sulphurous acid, and as this acid can only exist as\r\ngas in the usual temperature, it is disengaged, and occasions\r\neffervescence.\r\n\r\nThe second phenomenon is, that, when the metals have been previously\r\noxydated, they all dissolve in acids without effervescence: This is\r\neasily explained; because, not having now any occasion for combining\r\nwith oxygen, they neither decompose the acid nor the water by which, in\r\nthe former case, the effervescence is occasioned.\r\n\r\nA third phenomenon, which requires particular consideration, is, that\r\nnone of the metals produce effervescence by solution in oxygenated\r\nmuriatic acid. During this process the metal, in the first place,\r\ncarries off the excess of oxygen from the oxygenated muriatic acid, by\r\nwhich it becomes oxydated, and reduces the acid to the state of ordinary\r\nmuriatic acid. In this case there is no production of gas, not that the\r\nmuriatic acid does not tend to exist in the gasseous state in the common\r\ntemperature, which it does equally with the acids formerly mentioned,\r\nbut because this acid, which otherwise would expand into gas, finds more\r\nwater combined with the oxygenated muriatic acid than is necessary to\r\nretain it in the liquid form; hence it does not disengage like the\r\nsulphurous acid, but remains, and quietly dissolves and combines with\r\nthe metallic oxyd previously formed from its superabundant oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe fourth phenomenon is, that metals are absolutely insoluble in such\r\nacids as have their bases joined to oxygen by a stronger affinity than\r\nthese metals are capable of exerting upon that acidifying principle.\r\nHence silver, mercury, and lead, in their metallic states, are insoluble\r\nin muriatic acid, but, when previously oxydated, they become readily\r\nsoluble without effervescence.\r\n\r\nFrom these phenomena it appears that oxygen is the bond of union between\r\nmetals and acids; and from this we are led to suppose that oxygen is\r\ncontained in all substances which have a strong affinity with acids:\r\nHence it is very probable the four eminently salifiable earths contain\r\noxygen, and their capability of uniting with acids is produced by the\r\nintermediation of that element. What I have formerly noticed relative to\r\nthese earths is considerably strengthened by the above considerations,\r\nviz. that they may very possibly be metallic oxyds, with which oxygen\r\nhas a stronger affinity than with charcoal, and consequently not\r\nreducible by any known means.\r\n\r\nAll the acids hitherto known are enumerated in the following table, the\r\nfirst column of which contains the names of the acids according to the\r\nnew nomenclature, and in the second column are placed the bases or\r\nradicals of these acids, with observations.\r\n\r\n_Names of the Acids._      _Names of the Bases, with Observations._\r\n\r\n1.

The base and acid are\r\ndistinguished in French by _arsenic_ and _arsenique_; but, having chosen\r\nthe English termination _ic_ to translate the French _ique_, I was\r\nobliged to use this small deviation.--E.]\r\n\r\n[Note B: Mr Lavoisier has hydrargirique; but mercurius being used for\r\nthe base or metal, the name of the acid, as above, is equally regular,\r\nand less harsh.--E.]\r\n\r\nIn this list, which contains 48 acids, I have enumerated 17 metallic\r\nacids hitherto very imperfectly known, but upon which Mr Berthollet is\r\nabout to publish a very important work. It cannot be pretended that all\r\nthe acids which exist in nature, or rather all the acidifiable bases,\r\nare yet discovered; but, on the other hand, there are considerable\r\ngrounds for supposing that a more accurate investigation than has\r\nhitherto been attempted will diminish the number of the vegetable acids,\r\nby showing that several of these, at present considered as distinct\r\nacids, are only modifications of others. All that can be done in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge is, to give a view of chemistry as it\r\nreally is, and to establish fundamental principles, by which such bodies\r\nas may be discovered in future may receive names, in conformity with one\r\nuniform system.\r\n\r\nThe known salifiable bases, or substances capable of being converted\r\ninto neutral salts by union with acids, amount to 24; viz. 3 alkalies, 4\r\nearths, and 17 metallic substances; so that, in the present state of\r\nchemical knowledge, the whole possible number of neutral salts amounts\r\nto 1152[33]. This number is upon the supposition that the metallic acids\r\nare capable of dissolving other metals, which is a new branch of\r\nchemistry not hitherto investigated, upon which depends all the metallic\r\ncombinations named _vitreous_. There is reason to believe that many of\r\nthese supposable saline combinations are not capable of being formed,\r\nwhich must greatly reduce the real number of neutral salts producible by\r\nnature and art. Even if we suppose the real number to amount only to\r\nfive or six hundred species of possible neutral salts, it is evident\r\nthat, were we to distinguish them, after the manner of the ancients,\r\neither by the names of their first discoverers, or by terms derived from\r\nthe substances from which they are procured, we should at last have such\r\na confusion of arbitrary designations, as no memory could possibly\r\nretain. This method might be tolerable in the early ages of chemistry,\r\nor even till within these twenty years, when only about thirty species\r\nof salts were known; but, in the present times, when the number is\r\naugmenting daily, when every new acid gives us 24 or 48 new salts,\r\naccording as it is capable of one or two degrees of oxygenation, a new\r\nmethod is certainly necessary. The method we have adopted, drawn from\r\nthe nomenclature of the acids, is perfectly analogical, and, following\r\nnature in the simplicity of her operations, gives a natural and easy\r\nnomenclature applicable to every possible neutral salt.\r\n\r\nIn giving names to the different acids, we express the common property\r\nby the generical term _acid_, and distinguish each species by the name\r\nof its peculiar acidifiable base. Hence the acids formed by the\r\noxygenation of sulphur, phosphorus, charcoal, &c. are called _sulphuric\r\nacid_, _phosphoric acid_, _carbonic acid_, &c. We thought it likewise\r\nproper to indicate the different degrees of saturation with oxygen, by\r\ndifferent terminations of the same specific names. Hence we distinguish\r\nbetween sulphurous and sulphuric, and between phosphorous and phosphoric\r\nacids, &c.\r\n\r\nBy applying these principles to the nomenclature of neutral salts, we\r\ngive a common term to all the neutral salts arising from the combination\r\nof one acid, and distinguish the species by adding the name of the\r\nsalifiable base. Thus, all the neutral salts having sulphuric acid in\r\ntheir composition are named _sulphats_; those formed by the phosphoric\r\nacid, _phosphats_, &c. The species being distinguished by the names of\r\nthe salifiable bases gives us _sulphat of potash_, _sulphat of soda_,\r\n_sulphat of ammoniac_, _sulphat of lime_, _sulphat of iron_, &c. As we\r\nare acquainted with 24 salifiable bases, alkaline, earthy, and metallic,\r\nwe have consequently 24 sulphats, as many phosphats, and so on through\r\nall the acids. Sulphur is, however, susceptible of two degrees of\r\noxygenation, the first of which produces sulphurous, and the second,\r\nsulphuric acid; and, as the neutral salts produced by these two acids,\r\nhave different properties, and are in fact different salts, it becomes\r\nnecessary to distinguish these by peculiar terminations; we have\r\ntherefore distinguished the neutral salts formed by the acids in the\r\nfirst or lesser degree of oxygenation, by changing the termination _at_\r\ninto _ite_, as _sulphites_, _phosphites_[34], &c. Thus, oxygenated or\r\nacidified sulphur, in its two degrees of oxygenation is capable of\r\nforming 48 neutral salts, 24 of which are sulphites, and as many\r\nsulphats; which is likewise the case with all the acids capable of two\r\ndegrees of oxygenation[35].\r\n\r\nIt were both tiresome and unnecessary to follow these denominations\r\nthrough all the varieties of their possible application; it is enough to\r\nhave given the method of naming the various salts, which, when once well\r\nunderstood, is easily applied to every possible combination. The name of\r\nthe combustible and acidifiable body being once known, the names of the\r\nacid it is capable of forming, and of all the neutral combinations the\r\nacid is susceptible of entering into, are most readily remembered. Such\r\nas require a more complete illustration of the methods in which the new\r\nnomenclature is applied will, in the Second Part of this book, find\r\nTables which contain a full enumeration of all the neutral salts, and,\r\nin general, all the possible chemical combinations, so far as is\r\nconsistent with the present state of our knowledge. To these I shall\r\nsubjoin short explanations, containing the best and most simple means of\r\nprocuring the different species of acids, and some account of the\r\ngeneral properties of the neutral salts they produce.\r\n\r\nI shall not deny, that, to render this work more complete, it would have\r\nbeen necessary to add particular observations upon each species of salt,\r\nits solubility in water and alkohol, the proportions of acid and of\r\nsalifiable base in its composition, the quantity of its water of\r\ncristallization, the different degrees of saturation it is susceptible\r\nof, and, finally, the degree of force or affinity with which the acid\r\nadheres to the base. This immense work has been already begun by Messrs\r\nBergman, Morveau, Kirwan, and other celebrated chemists, but is hitherto\r\nonly in a moderate state of advancement, even the principles upon which\r\nit is founded are not perhaps sufficiently accurate.\r\n\r\nThese numerous details would have swelled this elementary treatise to\r\nmuch too great a size; besides that, to have gathered the necessary\r\nmaterials, and to have completed all the series of experiments\r\nrequisite, must have retarded the publication of this book for many\r\nyears. This is a vast field for employing the zeal and abilities of\r\nyoung chemists, whom I would advise to endeavour rather to do well than\r\nto do much, and to ascertain, in the first place, the composition of the\r\nacids, before entering upon that of the neutral salts. Every edifice\r\nwhich is intended to resist the ravages of time should be built upon a\r\nsure foundation; and, in the present state of chemistry, to attempt\r\ndiscoveries by experiments, either not perfectly exact, or not\r\nsufficiently rigorous, will serve only to interrupt its progress,\r\ninstead of contributing to its advancement.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] This number excludes all triple salts, or such as contain more than\r\none salifiable base, all the salts whose bases are over or under\r\nsaturated with acid, and those formed by the nitro-muriatic acid.--E.\r\n\r\n[34] As all the specific names of the acids in the new nomenclature are\r\nadjectives, they would have applied severally to the various salifiable\r\nbases, without the invention of other terms, with perfect distinctness.\r\nThus, _sulphurous potash_, and _sulphuric potash_, are equally distinct\r\nas _sulphite of potash_, and _sulphat of potash_; and have the advantage\r\nof being more easily retained in the memory, because more naturally\r\narising from the acids themselves, than the arbitrary terminations\r\nadopted by Mr Lavoisier.--E.\r\n\r\n[35] There is yet a third degree of oxygenation of acids, as the\r\noxygenated muriatic and oxygenated nitric acids. The terms applicable to\r\nthe neutral salts resulting from the union of these acids with\r\nsalifiable bases is supplied by the Author in the Second Part of this\r\nWork. These are formed by prefixing the word _oxygenated_ to the name of\r\nthe salt produced by the second degree of oxygenation.

But I afterwards found\r\nthat the addition of similar Tables of all the simple substances which\r\nenter into the composition of the acids and oxyds, together with the\r\nvarious possible combinations of these elements, would add greatly to\r\nthe utility of this work, without being any great increase to its size.\r\nThese additions, which are all contained in the twelve first sections of\r\nthis Part, and the Tables annexed to these, form a kind of\r\nrecapitulation of the first fifteen Chapters of the First Part: The rest\r\nof the Tables and Sections contain all the saline combinations.\r\n\r\nIt must be very apparent that, in this Part of the Work, I have borrowed\r\ngreatly from what has been already published by Mr de Morveau in the\r\nFirst Volume of the _Encyclopedie par ordre des Matières_. I could\r\nhardly have discovered a better source of information, especially when\r\nthe difficulty of consulting books in foreign languages is considered. I\r\nmake this general acknowledgment on purpose to save the trouble of\r\nreferences to Mr de Morveau's work in the course of the following part\r\nof mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SIMPLE SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nSimple substances belonging to all the kingdoms of nature, which may be\r\nconsidered as the elements of bodies.\r\n\r\n_New Names._                  _Correspondent old Names._\r\n\r\nLight                          Light.\r\n\r\nCaloric                       {Heat.\r\n                              {Principle or element of heat.\r\n                              {Fire.

I.--_Observations upon the Table of Simple Substances._\r\n\r\nThe principle object of chemical experiments is to decompose natural\r\nbodies, so as separately to examine the different substances which enter\r\ninto their composition. By consulting chemical systems, it will be found\r\nthat this science of chemical analysis has made rapid progress in our\r\nown times. Formerly oil and salt were considered as elements of bodies,\r\nwhereas later observation and experiment have shown that all salts,\r\ninstead of being simple, are composed of an acid united to a base. The\r\nbounds of analysis have been greatly enlarged by modern discoveries[36];\r\nthe acids are shown to be composed of oxygen, as an acidifying principle\r\ncommon to all, united in each to a particular base. I have proved what\r\nMr Haffenfratz had before advanced, that these radicals of the acids\r\nare not all simple elements, many of them being, like the oily\r\nprinciple, composed of hydrogen and charcoal. Even the bases of neutral\r\nsalts have been proved by Mr Berthollet to be compounds, as he has shown\r\nthat ammoniac is composed of azote and hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThus, as chemistry advances towards perfection, by dividing and\r\nsubdividing, it is impossible to say where it is to end; and these\r\nthings we at present suppose simple may soon be found quite otherwise.\r\nAll we dare venture to affirm of any substance is, that it must be\r\nconsidered as simple in the present state of our knowledge, and so far\r\nas chemical analysis has hitherto been able to show. We may even presume\r\nthat the earths must soon cease to be considered as simple bodies; they\r\nare the only bodies of the salifiable class which have no tendency to\r\nunite with oxygen; and I am much inclined to believe that this proceeds\r\nfrom their being already saturated with that element. If so, they will\r\nfall to be considered as compounds consisting of simple substances,\r\nperhaps metallic, oxydated to a certain degree. This is only hazarded as\r\na conjecture; and I trust the reader will take care not to confound what\r\nI have related as truths, fixed on the firm basis of observation and\r\nexperiment, with mere hypothetical conjectures.\r\n\r\nThe fixed alkalies, potash, and soda, are omitted in the foregoing\r\nTable, because they are evidently compound substances, though we are\r\nignorant as yet what are the elements they are composed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of compound oxydable and acidifiable bases._\r\n\r\n                             _Names of the radicals._\r\n\r\nOxydable or acidifiable    { Nitro-muriatic radical or\r\nbase, from the mineral     { base of the acid formerly\r\nkingdom.                   { called aqua regia.\r\n\r\n                           { Tartarous radical or base.\r\n                           { Malic.                }\r\n                           { Citric.               }\r\n                           { Pyro-lignous.         }\r\nOxydable or acidifiable    { Pyro-mucous.          }\r\nhydro-carbonous or         { Pyro-tartarous.       }\r\ncarbono-hydrous radicals   { Oxalic.               }\r\nfrom the vegetable         { Acetous.              }\r\nkingdom.                   { Succinic.             } Radicals\r\n                           { Benzoic.              }\r\n                           { Camphoric.            }\r\n                           { Gallic.               }\r\n                                                   }\r\nOxydable or acidifiable    { Lactic.               }\r\nradicals from the animal   { Saccholactic.         }\r\nkingdom, which             { Formic.               }\r\nmostly contain azote,      { Bombic.               }\r\nand frequently phosphorus. { Sebacic.              }\r\n                           { Lithic.               }\r\n                           { Prussic.              }\r\n\r\n_Note._--The radicals from the vegetable kingdom are converted by a\r\nfirst degree of oxygenation into vegetable oxyds, such as sugar, starch,\r\nand gum or mucus: Those of the animal kingdom by the same means form\r\nanimal oxyds, as lymph, &c.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.--_Observations upon the Table of Compound Radicals._\r\n\r\nThe older chemists being unacquainted with the composition of acids, and\r\nnot suspecting them to be formed by a peculiar radical or base for each,\r\nunited to an acidifying principle or element common to all, could not\r\nconsequently give any name to substances of which they had not the most\r\ndistant idea. We had therefore to invent a new nomenclature for this\r\nsubject, though we were at the same time sensible that this nomenclature\r\nmust be susceptible of great modification when the nature of the\r\ncompound radicals shall be better understood[37].\r\n\r\nThe compound oxydable and acidifiable radicals from the vegetable and\r\nanimal kingdoms, enumerated in the foregoing table, are not hitherto\r\nreducible to systematic nomenclature, because their exact analysis is as\r\nyet unknown. We only know in general, by some experiments of my own, and\r\nsome made by Mr Hassenfratz, that most of the vegetable acids, such as\r\nthe tartarous, oxalic, citric, malic, acetous, pyro-tartarous, and\r\npyromucous, have radicals composed of hydrogen and charcoal, combined\r\nin such a way as to form single bases, and that these acids only differ\r\nfrom each other by the proportions in which these two substances enter\r\ninto the composition of their bases, and by the degree of oxygenation\r\nwhich these bases have received. We know farther, chiefly from the\r\nexperiments of Mr Berthollet, that the radicals from the animal kingdom,\r\nand even some of those from vegetables, are of a more compound nature,\r\nand, besides hydrogen and charcoal, that they often contain azote, and\r\nsometimes phosphorus; but we are not hitherto possessed of sufficiently\r\naccurate experiments for calculating the proportions of these several\r\nsubstances. We are therefore forced, in the manner of the older\r\nchemists, still to name these acids after the substances from which they\r\nare procured. There can be little doubt that these names will be laid\r\naside when our knowledge of these substances becomes more accurate and\r\nextensive; the terms _hydro-carbonous_, _hydro-carbonic_,\r\n_carbono-hydrous_, and _carbono hydric_[38], will then become\r\nsubstituted for those we now employ, which will then only remain as\r\ntestimonies of the imperfect state in which this part of chemistry was\r\ntransmitted to us by our predecessors.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the oils, being composed of hydrogen and charcoal\r\ncombined, are true carbono-hydrous or hydro-carbonous radicals; and,\r\nindeed, by adding oxygen, they are convertible into vegetable oxyds and\r\nacids, according to their degrees of oxygenation. We cannot, however,\r\naffirm that oils enter in their entire state into the composition of\r\nvegetable oxyds and acids; it is possible that they previously lose a\r\npart either of their hydrogen or charcoal, and that the remaining\r\ningredients no longer exist in the proportions necessary to constitute\r\noils. We still require farther experiments to elucidate these points.\r\n\r\nProperly speaking, we are only acquainted with one compound radical from\r\nthe mineral kingdom, the nitro-muriatic, which is formed by the\r\ncombination of azote with the muriatic radical. The other compound\r\nmineral acids have been much less attended to, from their producing less\r\nstriking phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Light and Caloric\r\nwith different Substances._\r\n\r\nI have not constructed any table of the combinations of light and\r\ncaloric with the various simple and compound substances, because our\r\nconceptions of the nature of these combinations are not hitherto\r\nsufficiently accurate. We know, in general, that all bodies in nature\r\nare imbued, surrounded, and penetrated in every way with caloric, which\r\nfills up every interval left between their particles; that, in certain\r\ncases, caloric becomes fixed in bodies, so as to constitute a part even\r\nof their solid substance, though it more frequently acts upon them with\r\na repulsive force, from which, or from its accumulation in bodies to a\r\ngreater or lesser degree, the transformation of solids into fluids, and\r\nof fluids to aëriform elasticity, is entirely owing. We have employed\r\nthe generic name _gas_ to indicate this aëriform state of bodies\r\nproduced by a sufficient accumulation of caloric; so that, when we wish\r\nto express the aëriform state of muriatic acid, carbonic acid, hydrogen,\r\nwater, alkohol, &c. we do it by adding the word _gas_ to their names;\r\nthus muriatic acid gas, carbonic acid gas, hydrogen gas, aqueous gas,\r\nalkoholic gas, &c.\r\n\r\nThe combinations of light, and its mode of acting upon different bodies,\r\nis still less known. By the experiments of Mr Berthollet, it appears to\r\nhave great affinity with oxygen, is susceptible of combining with it,\r\nand contributes alongst with caloric to change it into the state of gas.\r\nExperiments upon vegetation give reason to believe that light combines\r\nwith certain parts of vegetables, and that the green of their leaves,\r\nand the various colours of their flowers, is chiefly owing to this\r\ncombination. This much is certain, that plants which grow in darkness\r\nare perfectly white, languid, and unhealthy, and that to make them\r\nrecover vigour, and to acquire their natural colours, the direct\r\ninfluence of light is absolutely necessary. Somewhat similar takes place\r\neven upon animals: Mankind degenerate to a certain degree when employed\r\nin sedentary manufactures, or from living in crowded houses, or in the\r\nnarrow lanes of large cities; whereas they improve in their nature and\r\nconstitution in most of the country labours which are carried on in the\r\nopen air. Organization, sensation, spontaneous motion, and all the\r\noperations of life, only exist at the surface of the earth, and in\r\nplaces exposed to the influence of light. Without it nature itself would\r\nbe lifeless and inanimate. By means of light, the benevolence of the\r\nDeity hath filled the surface of the earth with organization, sensation,\r\nand intelligence. The fable of Promotheus might perhaps be considered as\r\ngiving a hint of this philosophical truth, which had even presented\r\nitself to the knowledge of the ancients. I have intentionally avoided\r\nany disquisitions relative to organized bodies in this work, for which\r\nreason the phenomena of respiration, sanguification, and animal heat,\r\nare not considered; but I hope, at some future time, to be able to\r\nelucidate these curious subjects.\r\n\r\n[Trancriber's note: The following table is presented in four sections to\r\ncomply with 75 character line

IV.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Oxygen with the simple\r\nSubstances._\r\n\r\nOxygen forms almost a third of the mass of our atmosphere, and is\r\nconsequently one of the most plentiful substances in nature. All the\r\nanimals and vegetables live and grow in this immense magazine of oxygen\r\ngas, and from it we procure the greatest part of what we employ in\r\nexperiments. So great is the reciprocal affinity between this element\r\nand other substances, that we cannot procure it disengaged from all\r\ncombination. In the atmosphere it is united with caloric, in the state\r\nof oxygen gas, and this again is mixed with about two thirds of its\r\nweight of azotic gas.\r\n\r\nSeveral conditions are requisite to enable a body to become oxygenated,\r\nor to permit oxygen to enter into combination with it. In the first\r\nplace, it is necessary that the particles of the body to be oxygenated\r\nshall have less reciprocal attraction with each other than they have for\r\nthe oxygen, which otherwise cannot possibly combine with them. Nature,\r\nin this case, may be assisted by art, as we have it in our power to\r\ndiminish the attraction of the particles of bodies almost at will by\r\nheating them, or, in other words, by introducing caloric into the\r\ninterstices between their particles; and, as the attraction of these\r\nparticles for each other is diminished in the inverse ratio of their\r\ndistance, it is evident that there must be a certain point of distance\r\nof particles when the affinity they possess with each other becomes less\r\nthan that they have for oxygen, and at which oxygenation must\r\nnecessarily take place if oxygen be present.\r\n\r\nWe can readily conceive that the degree of heat at which this phenomenon\r\nbegins must be different in different bodies. Hence, on purpose to\r\noxygenate most bodies, especially the greater part of the simple\r\nsubstances, it is only necessary to expose them to the influence of the\r\nair of the atmosphere in a convenient degree of temperature. With\r\nrespect to lead, mercury, and tin, this needs be but little higher than\r\nthe medium temperature of the earth; but it requires a more considerable\r\ndegree of heat to oxygenate iron, copper, &c. by the dry way, or when\r\nthis operation is not assisted by moisture. Sometimes oxygenation takes\r\nplace with great rapidity, and is accompanied by great sensible heat,\r\nlight, and flame; such is the combustion of phosphorus in atmospheric\r\nair, and of iron in oxygen gas. That of sulphur is less rapid; and the\r\noxygenation of lead, tin, and most of the metals, takes place vastly\r\nslower, and consequently the disengagement of caloric, and more\r\nespecially of light, is hardly sensible.\r\n\r\nSome substances have so strong an affinity with oxygen, and combine with\r\nit in such low degrees of temperature, that we cannot procure them in\r\ntheir unoxygenated state; such is the muriatic acid, which has not\r\nhitherto been decomposed by art, perhaps even not by nature, and which\r\nconsequently has only been found in the state of acid. It is probable\r\nthat many other substances of the mineral kingdom are necessarily\r\noxygenated in the common temperature of the atmosphere, and that being\r\nalready saturated with oxygen, prevents their farther action upon that\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nThere are other means of oxygenating simple substances besides exposure\r\nto air in a certain degree of temperature, such as by placing them in\r\ncontact with metals combined with oxygen, and which have little affinity\r\nwith that element. The red oxyd of mercury is one of the best substances\r\nfor this purpose, especially with bodies which do not combine with that\r\nmetal. In this oxyd the oxygen is united with very little force to the\r\nmetal, and can be driven out by a degree of heat only sufficient to make\r\nglass red hot; wherefore such bodies as are capable of uniting with\r\noxygen are readily oxygenated, by means of being mixed with red oxyd of\r\nmercury, and moderately heated. The same effect may be, to a certain\r\ndegree, produced by means of the black oxyd of manganese, the red oxyd\r\nof lead, the oxyds of silver, and by most of the metallic oxyds, if we\r\nonly take care to choose such as have less affinity with oxygen than the\r\nbodies they are meant to oxygenate. All the metallic reductions and\r\nrevivifications belong to this class of operations, being nothing more\r\nthan oxygenations of charcoal, by means of the several metallic oxyds.\r\nThe charcoal combines with the oxygen and with caloric, and escapes in\r\nform of carbonic acid gas, while the metal remains pure and revivified,\r\nor deprived of the oxygen which before combined with it in the form of\r\noxyd.\r\n\r\nAll combustible substances may likewise be oxygenated by means of mixing\r\nthem with nitrat of potash or of soda, or with oxygenated muriat of\r\npotash, and subjecting the mixture to a certain degree of heat; the\r\noxygen, in this case, quits the nitrat or the muriat, and combines with\r\nthe combustible body. This species of oxygenation requires to be\r\nperformed with extreme caution, and only with very small quantities;\r\nbecause, as the oxygen enters into the composition of nitrats, and more\r\nespecially of oxygenated muriats, combined with almost as much caloric\r\nas is necessary for converting it into oxygen gas, this immense quantity\r\nof caloric becomes suddenly free the instant of the combination of the\r\noxygen with the combustible body, and produces such violent explosions\r\nas are perfectly irresistible.\r\n\r\nBy the humid way we can oxygenate most combustible bodies, and convert\r\nmost of the oxyds of the three kingdoms of nature into acids. For this\r\npurpose we chiefly employ the nitric acid, which has a very slight hold\r\nof oxygen, and quits it readily to a great number of bodies by the\r\nassistance of a gentle heat. The oxygenated muriatic acid may be used\r\nfor several operations of this kind, but not in them all.\r\n\r\nI give the name of _binary_ to the combinations of oxygen with the\r\nsimple substances, because in these only two elements are combined. When\r\nthree substances are united in one combination I call it _ternary_, and\r\n_quaternary_ when the combination consists of four substances united.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the combinations of Oxygen with the compound radicals._\r\n\r\n_Names of the radicals._       _Names of the resulting acids._\r\n                       _New nomenclature._  _Old nomenclature._\r\n\r\nNitro muriatic}        Nitro muriatic acid  Aqua regia.\r\nradical       }\r\n\r\n(A)\r\nTartaric               Tartarous acid       Unknown till lately.\r\nMalic                  Malic acid           Ditto.\r\nCitric                 Citric acid          Acid of lemons.\r\nPyro-lignous           Pyro-lignous acid    Empyreumatic acid of wood.\r\nPyro-mucous            Pyro-mucous acid     Empyr. acid of sugar.\r\nPyro-tartarous         Pyro-tartarous acid  Empyr. acid of tartar.\r\nOxalic                 Oxalic acid          Acid of sorel.\r\nAcetic                {Acetous acid         Vinegar, or acid of vinegar.\r\n                      {Acetic acid          Radical vinegar.\r\nSuccinic               Succinic acid        Volatile salt of amber.\r\nBenzoic                Benzotic acid        Flowers of benzoin.\r\nCamphoric              Camphoric acid       Unknown till lately.\r\nGallic                 Gallic acid         {The astringent principle\r\n                                           {of vegetables.\r\n\r\n(B)\r\nLactic                 Lactic acid          Acid of sour whey.\r\nSaccholactic           Saccholactic acid    Unknown till lately.\r\nFormic                 Formic acid          Acid of ants.\r\nBombic                 Bombic acid          Unknown till lately.\r\nSebacic                Sebacic acid         Ditto.\r\nLithic                 Lithic acid          Urinary calculus.\r\nPrussic                Prussic acid         Colouring matter of Prussian blue.\r\n\r\n[Note A: These radicals by a first degree of oxygenation form vegetable\r\noxyds, as sugar, starch, mucus, &c.--A.]\r\n\r\n[Note B: These radicals by a first degree of oxygenation form the animal\r\noxyds, as lymph, red part of the blood, animal secretions, &c.--A.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Oxygen with the\r\nCompound Radicals._\r\n\r\nI published a new theory of the nature and formation of acids in the\r\nMemoirs of the Academy for 1776, p. 671. and 1778, p. 535. in which I\r\nconcluded, that the number of acids must be greatly larger than was till\r\nthen supposed. Since that time, a new field of inquiry has been opened\r\nto chemists; and, instead of five or six acids which were then known,\r\nnear thirty new acids have been discovered, by which means the number of\r\nknown neutral salts have been increased in the same proportion. The\r\nnature of the acidifiable bases, or radicals of the acids, and the\r\ndegrees of oxygenation they are susceptible of, still remain to be\r\ninquired into. I have already shown, that almost all the oxydable and\r\nacidifiable radicals from the mineral kingdom are simple, and that, on\r\nthe contrary, there hardly exists any radical in the vegetable, and more\r\nespecially in the animal kingdom, but is composed of at least two\r\nsubstances, hydrogen and charcoal, and that azote and phosphorus are\r\nfrequently united to these, by which we have compound radicals of two,\r\nthree, and four bases or simple elements united.\r\n\r\nFrom these observations, it appears that the vegetable and animal oxyds\r\nand acids may differ from each other in three several ways: 1st,\r\nAccording to the number of simple acidifiable elements of which their\r\nradicals are composed: 2dly, According to the proportions in which these\r\nare combined together: And, 3dly, According to their different degrees\r\nof oxygenation: Which circumstances are more than sufficient to explain\r\nthe great variety which nature produces in these substances. It is not\r\nat all surprising, after this, that most of the vegetable acids are\r\nconvertible into each other, nothing more being requisite than to change\r\nthe proportions of the hydrogen and charcoal in their composition, and\r\nto oxygenate them in a greater or lesser degree. This has been done by\r\nMr Crell in some very ingenious experiments, which have been verified\r\nand extended by Mr Hassenfratz. From these it appears, that charcoal and\r\nhydrogen, by a first oxygenation, produce tartarous acid, oxalic acid by\r\na second degree, and acetous or acetic acid by a third, or higher\r\noxygenation; only, that charcoal seems to exist in a rather smaller\r\nproportion in the acetous and acetic acids. The citric and malic acids\r\ndiffer little from the preceding acids.\r\n\r\nOught we then to conclude that the oils are the radicals of the\r\nvegetable and animal acids? I have already expressed my doubts upon\r\nthis subject: 1st, Although the oils appear to be formed of nothing but\r\nhydrogen and charcoal, we do not know if these are in the precise\r\nproportion necessary for constituting the radicals of the acids: 2dly,\r\nSince oxygen enters into the composition of these acids equally with\r\nhydrogen and charcoal, there is no more reason for supposing them to be\r\ncomposed of oil rather than of water or of carbonic acid. It is true\r\nthat they contain the materials necessary for all these combinations,\r\nbut then these do not take place in the common temperature of the\r\natmosphere; all the three elements remain combined in a state of\r\nequilibrium, which is readily destroyed by a temperature only a little\r\nabove that of boiling water[39].\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Binary Combinations of Azote with the Simple Substances._\r\n\r\n_Simple Substances._             _Results of the Combinations._\r\n                     _New Nomenclature._         _Old Nomenclature._\r\n\r\nCaloric               Azotic gas               Phlogisticated air, or Mephitis.\r\nHydrogen              Ammoniac                 Volatile alkali.\r\n\r\n                     {Nitrous oxyd              Base of Nitrous gas.\r\n                     {Nitrous acid              Smoaking nitrous acid.\r\nOxygen               {Nitric acid               Pale nitrous acid.\r\n                     {Oxygenated nitric acid    Unknown.\r\n\r\n                     {This combination is hitherto unknown; should it\r\n                     {ever be discovered, it will be called, according to\r\nCharcoal             {the principles of our nomenclature, Azuret of\r\n                     {Charcoal.

VI.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Azote with the Simple\r\nSubstances._\r\n\r\nAzote is one of the most abundant elements; combined with caloric it\r\nforms azotic gas, or mephitis, which composes nearly two thirds of the\r\natmosphere. This element is always in the state of gas in the ordinary\r\npressure and temperature, and no degree of compression or of cold has\r\nbeen hitherto capable of reducing it either to a solid or liquid form.\r\nThis is likewise one of the essential constituent elements of animal\r\nbodies, in which it is combined with charcoal and hydrogen, and\r\nsometimes with phosphorus; these are united together by a certain\r\nportion of oxygen, by which they are formed into oxyds or acids\r\naccording to the degree of oxygenation. Hence the animal substances may\r\nbe varied, in the same way with vegetables, in three different manners:\r\n1st, According to the number of elements which enter into the\r\ncomposition of the base or radical: 2dly, According to the proportions\r\nof these elements: 3dly, According to the degree of oxygenation.\r\n\r\nWhen combined with oxygen, azote forms the nitrous and nitric oxyds and\r\nacids; when with hydrogen, ammoniac is produced. Its combinations with\r\nthe other simple elements are very little known; to these we give the\r\nname of Azurets, preserving the termination in _uret_ for all\r\nnonoxygenated compounds. It is extremely probable that all the alkaline\r\nsubstances may hereafter be found to belong to this genus of azurets.\r\n\r\nThe azotic gas may be procured from atmospheric air, by absorbing the\r\noxygen gas which is mixed with it by means of a solution of sulphuret of\r\npotash, or sulphuret of lime. It requires twelve or fifteen days to\r\ncomplete this process, during which time the surface in contact must be\r\nfrequently renewed by agitation, and by breaking the pellicle which\r\nforms on the top of the solution. It may likewise be procured by\r\ndissolving animal substances in dilute nitric acid very little heated.\r\nIn this operation, the azote is disengaged in form of gas, which we\r\nreceive under bell glasses filled with water in the pneumato-chemical\r\napparatus. We may procure this gas by deflagrating nitre with charcoal,\r\nor any other combustible substance; when with charcoal, the azotic gas\r\nis mixed with carbonic acid gas, which may be absorbed by a solution of\r\ncaustic alkali, or by lime water, after which the azotic gas remains\r\npure. We can procure it in a fourth manner from combinations of ammoniac\r\nwith metallic oxyds, as pointed out by Mr de Fourcroy: The hydrogen of\r\nthe ammoniac combines with the oxygen of the oxyd, and forms water,\r\nwhilst the azote being left free escapes in form of gas.\r\n\r\nThe combinations of azote were but lately discovered: Mr Cavendish first\r\nobserved it in nitrous gas and acid, and Mr Berthollet in ammoniac and\r\nthe prussic acid. As no evidence of its decomposition has hitherto\r\nappeared, we are fully entitled to consider azote as a simple elementary\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Binary Combinations of Hydrogen with Simple Substances._\r\n\r\n_Simple_                     _Resulting Compounds._\r\n_Substances._    _New Nomenclature._              _Old Names._\r\n\r\nCaloric        Hydrogen gas                   Inflammable air.\r\nAzote          Ammoniac                       Volatile Alkali.\r\nOxygen         Water                          Water.\r\n\r\nSulphur       {Hydruret of sulphur, or    }\r\n              {sulphuret of hydrogen      }   Hitherto unknown (A).\r\nPhosphorus    {Hydruret of phosphorus, or }\r\n              {phosphuret of hydrogen     }\r\n\r\nCharcoal      {Hydro-carbonous, or        }   Not known till lately.\r\n              {carbono-hydrous radicals(B)}\r\n\r\nMetallic      {Metallic hydrurets(C), as  }   Hitherto unknown.\r\nsubstances,   {hydruret of iron, &c.      }\r\nas iron, &c.  {                           }\r\n\r\n[Note A: These combinations take place in the state of gas, and form,\r\nrespectively, sulphurated and phosphorated oxygen gas--A.]\r\n\r\n[Note B: This combination of hydrogen with charcoal includes the fixed\r\nand volatile oils, and forms the radicals of a considerable part of the\r\nvegetable and animal oxyds and acids.

VII.--_Observations upon Hydrogen, and its Combinations with\r\nSimple Substances._\r\n\r\nHydrogen, as its name expresses, is one of the constituent elements of\r\nwater, of which it forms fifteen hundredth parts by weight, combined\r\nwith eighty-five hundredth parts of oxygen. This substance, the\r\nproperties and even existence of which was unknown till lately, is very\r\nplentifully distributed in nature, and acts a very considerable part in\r\nthe processes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. As it possesses so\r\ngreat affinity with caloric as only to exist in the state of gas, it is\r\nconsequently impossible to procure it in the concrete or liquid state,\r\nindependent of combination.\r\n\r\nTo procure hydrogen, or rather hydrogen gas, we have only to subject\r\nwater to the action of a substance with which oxygen has greater\r\naffinity than it has to hydrogen; by this means the hydrogen is set\r\nfree, and, by uniting with caloric, assumes the form of hydrogen gas.\r\nRed hot iron is usually employed for this purpose: The iron, during the\r\nprocess, becomes oxydated, and is changed into a substance resembling\r\nthe iron ore from the island of Elba. In this state of oxyd it is much\r\nless attractible by the magnet, and dissolves in acids without\r\neffervescence.\r\n\r\nCharcoal, in a red heat, has the same power of decomposing water, by\r\nattracting the oxygen from its combination with hydrogen. In this\r\nprocess carbonic acid gas is formed, and mixes with the hydrogen gas,\r\nbut is easily separated by means of water or alkalies, which absorb the\r\ncarbonic acid, and leave the hydrogen gas pure. We may likewise obtain\r\nhydrogen gas by dissolving iron or zinc in dilute sulphuric acid. These\r\ntwo metals decompose water very slowly, and with great difficulty, when\r\nalone, but do it with great ease and rapidity when assisted by sulphuric\r\nacid; the hydrogen unites with caloric during the process, and is\r\ndisengaged in form of hydrogen gas, while the oxygen of the water unites\r\nwith the metal in the form of oxyd, which is immediately dissolved in\r\nthe acid, forming a sulphat of iron or of zinc.\r\n\r\nSome very distinguished chemists consider hydrogen as the _phlogiston_\r\nof Stahl; and as that celebrated chemist admitted the existence of\r\nphlogiston in sulphur, charcoal, metals, &c. they are of course obliged\r\nto suppose that hydrogen exists in all these substances, though they\r\ncannot prove their supposition; even if they could, it would not avail\r\nmuch, since this disengagement of hydrogen is quite insufficient to\r\nexplain the phenomena of calcination and combustion. We must always\r\nrecur to the examination of this question, \"Are the heat and light,\r\nwhich are disengaged during the different species of combustion,\r\nfurnished by the burning body, or by the oxygen which combines in all\r\nthese operations?\" And certainly the supposition of hydrogen being\r\ndisengaged throws no light whatever upon this question. Besides, it\r\nbelongs to those who make suppositions to prove them; and, doubtless, a\r\ndoctrine which without any supposition explains the phenomena as well,\r\nand as naturally, as theirs does by supposition, has at least the\r\nadvantage of greater simplicity[40].\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Binary Combinations of Sulphur with Simple Substances._\r\n\r\n_Simple_                 _Resulting Compounds._\r\n_Substances._    _New Nomenclature._       _Old Nomenclature._\r\n\r\nCaloric      Sulphuric gas\r\n\r\n           { Oxyd of sulphur           Soft sulphur.\r\nOxygen     { Sulphurous acid           Sulphureous acid.\r\n           { Sulphuric acid            Vitriolic acid.\r\n\r\nHydrogen     Sulphuret of hydrogen   }\r\nAzote                     azote      } Unknown Combinations.\r\nPhosphorus                phosphorus }\r\nCharcoal                  charcoal   }\r\n\r\nAntimony                  antimony     Crude antimony.\r\nSilver                    silver\r\nArsenic                   arsenic      Orpiment, realgar.\r\nBismuth                   bismuth\r\nCobalt                    cobalt\r\nCopper                    copper       Copper pyrites.\r\nTin                       tin\r\nIron                      iron         Iron pyrites.\r\nManganese                 manganese\r\nMercury                   mercury      Ethiops mineral, cinnabar.\r\nMolybdena                 molybdena\r\nNickel                    nickel\r\nGold                      gold\r\nPlatina                   platina\r\nLead                      lead          Galena.\r\nTungstein                 tungstein\r\nZinc                      zinc          Blende.\r\n\r\n                                      { Alkaline liver of sulphur\r\nPotash                    potash      { with fixed vegetable alkali.\r\n\r\n                                      { Alkaline liver of sulphur\r\nSoda                      soda        { with fixed mineral\r\n                                      { alkali.\r\n\r\n                                      { Volatile liver of sulphur,\r\nAmmoniac                  ammoniac    { smoaking liquor\r\n                                      { of Boyle.\r\n\r\nLime                      lime          Calcareous liver of sulphur.\r\nMagnesia                  magnesia      Magnesian liver of sulphur.\r\nBarytes                   barytes       Barytic liver of sulphur.\r\nArgill                    argill        Yet unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII.--_Observations on Sulphur, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nSulphur is a combustible substance, having a very great tendency to\r\ncombination; it is naturally in a solid state in the ordinary\r\ntemperature, and requires a heat somewhat higher than boiling water to\r\nmake it liquify. Sulphur is formed by nature in a considerable degree of\r\npurity in the neighbourhood of volcanos; we find it likewise, chiefly in\r\nthe state of sulphuric acid, combined with argill in aluminous schistus,\r\nwith lime in gypsum, &c. From these combinations it may be procured in\r\nthe state of sulphur, by carrying off its oxygen by means of charcoal in\r\na red heat; carbonic acid is formed, and escapes in the state of gas;\r\nthe sulphur remains combined with the clay, lime, &c. in the state of\r\nsulphuret, which is decomposed by acids; the acid unites with the earth\r\ninto a neutral salt, and the sulphur is precipitated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Binary Combinations of Phosphorus with the Simple\r\nSubstances._\r\n\r\n_Simple Substances._   _Resulting Compounds._\r\n\r\nCaloric                Phosphoric gas.\r\n\r\n                     { Oxyd of phosphorus.\r\nOxygen               { Phosphorous acid.\r\n                     { Phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\nHydrogen               Phosphuret of hydrogen.\r\nAzote                  Phosphuret of azote.\r\nSulphur                Phosphuret of Sulphur.\r\nCharcoal               Phosphuret of charcoal.\r\nMetallic substances    Phosphuret of metals(A).\r\n\r\nPotash   }\r\nSoda     }\r\nAmmoniac }             Phosphuret of Potash,\r\nLime     }             Soda, &c.(B)\r\nBarytes  }\r\nMagnesia }\r\nArgill   }\r\n\r\n[Note A: Of all these combinations of phosphorus with metals, that with\r\niron only is hitherto known, forming the substance formerly called\r\nSiderite; neither is it yet ascertained whether, in this combination,\r\nthe phosphorus be oxygenated or not.--A.]\r\n\r\n[Note B: These combinations of phosphorus with the alkalies and earths\r\nare not yet known; and, from the experiments of Mr Gengembre, they\r\nappear to be impossible--A.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IX.--_Observations upon Phosphorus, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nPhosphorus is a simple combustible substance, which was unknown to\r\nchemists till 1667, when it was discovered by Brandt, who kept the\r\nprocess secret; soon after Kunkel found out Brandt's method of\r\npreparation, and made it public. It has been ever since known by the\r\nname of Kunkel's phosphorus. It was for a long time procured only from\r\nurine; and, though Homberg gave an account of the process in the Memoirs\r\nof the Academy for 1692, all the philosophers of Europe were supplied\r\nwith it from England. It was first made in France in 1737, before a\r\ncommittee of the Academy at the Royal Garden. At present it is procured\r\nin a more commodious and more oeconomical manner from animal bones,\r\nwhich are real calcareous phosphats, according to the process of Messrs\r\nGahn, Scheele, Rouelle, &c. The bones of adult animals being calcined to\r\nwhiteness, are pounded, and passed through a fine silk sieve; pour upon\r\nthe fine powder a quantity of dilute sulphuric acid, less than is\r\nsufficient for dissolving the whole. This acid unites with the\r\ncalcareous earth of the bones into a sulphat of lime, and the phosphoric\r\nacid remains free in the liquor. The liquid is decanted off, and the\r\nresiduum washed with boiling water; this water which has been used to\r\nwash out the adhering acid is joined with what was before decanted off,\r\nand the whole is gradually evaporated; the dissolved sulphat of lime\r\ncristallizes in form of silky threads, which are removed, and by\r\ncontinuing the evaporation we procure the phosphoric acid under the\r\nappearance of a white pellucid glass. When this is powdered, and mixed\r\nwith one third its weight of charcoal, we procure very pure phosphorus\r\nby sublimation. The phosphoric acid, as procured by the above process,\r\nis never so pure as that obtained by oxygenating pure phosphorus either\r\nby combustion or by means of nitric acid; wherefore this latter should\r\nalways be employed in experiments of research.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus is found in almost all animal substances, and in some plants\r\nwhich give a kind of animal analysis. In all these it is usually\r\ncombined with charcoal, hydrogen, and azote, forming very compound\r\nradicals, which are, for the most part, in the state of oxyds by a first\r\ndegree of union with oxygen. The discovery of Mr Hassenfratz, of\r\nphosphorus being contained in charcoal, gives reason to suspect that it\r\nis more common in the vegetable kingdom than has generally been\r\nsupposed: It is certain, that, by proper processes, it may be procured\r\nfrom every individual of some of the families of plants.\r\n\r\nAs no experiment has hitherto given reason to suspect that phosphorus is\r\na compound body, I have arranged it with the simple or elementary\r\nsubstances. It takes fire at the temperature of 32° (104°) of the\r\nthermometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Binary Combinations of Charcoal._\r\n\r\n_Simple_\r\n_Substances._      _Resulting Compounds._\r\n\r\n                    { Oxyd of charcoal          Unknown.\r\nOxygen              { Carbonic acid             Fixed air, chalky acid.\r\n\r\nSulphur               Carburet of sulphur    }\r\nPhosphorus            Carburet of phosphorus }  Unknown.\r\nAzote                 Carburet of azote      }\r\n\r\n                    { Carbono-hydrous radical\r\nHydrogen            { Fixed and volatile oils\r\n\r\n                                              { Of these only the carburets of\r\nMetallic substances   Carburets of metals     { iron and zinc are known, and\r\n                                              { were formerly called Plumbago.\r\n\r\nAlkalies and earths   Carburet of potash, &c.

X.--_Observations upon Charcoal, and its Combinations with Simple\r\nSubstances._\r\n\r\nAs charcoal has not been hitherto decomposed, it must, in the present\r\nstate of our knowledge, be considered as a simple substance. By modern\r\nexperiments it appears to exist ready formed in vegetables; and I have\r\nalready remarked, that, in these, it is combined with hydrogen,\r\nsometimes with azote and phosphorus, forming compound radicals, which\r\nmay be changed into oxyds or acids according to their degree of\r\noxygenation.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the charcoal contained in vegetable or animal substances, we\r\nsubject them to the action of fire, at first moderate, and afterwards\r\nvery strong, on purpose to drive off the last portions of water, which\r\nadhere very obstinately to the charcoal. For chemical purposes, this is\r\nusually done in retorts of stone-ware or porcellain, into which the\r\nwood, or other matter, is introduced, and then placed in a reverberatory\r\nfurnace, raised gradually to its greatest heat: The heat volatilizes, or\r\nchanges into gas, all the parts of the body susceptible of combining\r\nwith caloric into that form, and the charcoal, being more fixed in its\r\nnature, remains in the retort combined with a little earth and some\r\nfixed salts.\r\n\r\nIn the business of charring wood, this is done by a less expensive\r\nprocess. The wood is disposed in heaps, and covered with earth, so as to\r\nprevent the access of any more air than is absolutely necessary for\r\nsupporting the fire, which is kept up till all the water and oil is\r\ndriven off, after which the fire is extinguished by shutting up all the\r\nair-holes.\r\n\r\nWe may analyse charcoal either by combustion in air, or rather in oxygen\r\ngas, or by means of nitric acid. In either case we convert it into\r\ncarbonic acid, and sometimes a little potash and some neutral salts\r\nremain. This analysis has hitherto been but little attended to by\r\nchemists; and we are not even certain if potash exists in charcoal\r\nbefore combustion, or whether it be formed by means of some unknown\r\ncombination during that process.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XI.--_Observations upon the Muriatic, Fluoric, and Boracic\r\nRadicals, and their Combinations._\r\n\r\nAs the combinations of these substances, either with each other, or with\r\nthe other combustible bodies, are hitherto entirely unknown, we have\r\nnot attempted to form any table for their nomenclature. We only know\r\nthat these radicals are susceptible of oxygenation, and of forming the\r\nmuriatic, fluoric, and boracic acids, and that in the acid state they\r\nenter into a number of combinations, to be afterwards detailed.\r\nChemistry has hitherto been unable to disoxygenate any of them, so as to\r\nproduce them in a simple state. For this purpose, some substance must be\r\nemployed to which oxygen has a stronger affinity than to their radicals,\r\neither by means of single affinity, or by double elective attraction.\r\nAll that is known relative to the origin of the radicals of these acids\r\nwill be mentioned in the sections set apart for considering their\r\ncombinations with the salifiable bases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XII.--_Observations upon the Combinations of Metals with each\r\nother._\r\n\r\nBefore closing our account of the simple or elementary substances, it\r\nmight be supposed necessary to give a table of alloys or combinations of\r\nmetals with each other; but, as such a table would be both exceedingly\r\nvoluminous and very unsatisfactory, without going into a series of\r\nexperiments not yet attempted, I have thought it adviseable to omit it\r\naltogether. All that is necessary to be mentioned is, that these alloys\r\nshould be named according to the metal in largest proportion in the\r\nmixture or combination; thus the term _alloy of gold and silver_, or\r\ngold alloyed with silver, indicates that gold is the predominating\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nMetallic alloys, like all other combinations, have a point of\r\nsaturation. It would even appear, from the experiments of Mr de la\r\nBriche, that they have two perfectly distinct degrees of saturation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Azote in the state of Nitrous Acid with\r\nthe Salifiable Bases, arranged according to the affinities of these\r\nBases with the Acid_.\r\n\r\n_Names of the bases._       _Names of the neutral salts._\r\n                        _New nomenclature._     _Notes._\r\n\r\nBarytes           Nitrite of barytes.   {\r\nPotash                       potash.    { These salts are only\r\nSoda                         soda.      { known of late, and\r\nLime                         lime.      { have received no particular\r\nMagnesia                     magnesia.  { name in the old\r\nAmmoniac                    ammoniac.  { nomenclature.\r\nArgill                      argill.    {\r\n\r\n                                  { As metals dissolve both in nitrous and\r\nOxyd of zinc                zinc.      { nitric acids, metallic salts must of\r\n        iron                iron.      { consequence be formed having\r\n        manganese           manganese. { different degrees of oxygenation.\r\n        cobalt              cobalt.    { Those wherein the metal is\r\n        nickel              nickel.    { least oxygenated must be\r\n        lead                lead.      { called Nitrites, when more so,\r\n        tin                 tin.       { Nitrats; but the limits of this\r\n        copper              copper.    { distinction are difficultly\r\n        bismuth             bismuth.   { ascertainable.

XIII.--_Observations upon the Nitrous and Nitric Acids, and their\r\nCombinations._\r\n\r\nThe nitrous and nitric acids are procured from a neutral salt long known\r\nin the arts under the name of _saltpetre_. This salt is extracted by\r\nlixiviation from the rubbish of old buildings, from the earth of\r\ncellars, stables, or barns, and in general of all inhabited places. In\r\nthese earths the nitric acid is usually combined with lime and magnesia,\r\nsometimes with potash, and rarely with argill. As all these salts,\r\nexcepting the nitrat of potash, attract the moisture of the air, and\r\nconsequently would be difficultly preserved, advantage is taken, in the\r\nmanufactures of saltpetre and the royal refining house, of the greater\r\naffinity of the nitric acid to potash than these other bases, by which\r\nmeans the lime, magnesia, and argill, are precipitated, and all these\r\nnitrats are reduced to the nitrat of potash or saltpetre[41].\r\n\r\nThe nitric acid is procured from this salt by distillation, from three\r\nparts of pure saltpetre decomposed by one part of concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid, in a retort with Woulfe's apparatus, (Pl. IV. fig. 1.)\r\nhaving its bottles half filled with water, and all its joints carefully\r\nluted. The nitrous acid passes over in form of red vapours surcharged\r\nwith nitrous gas, or, in other words, not saturated with oxygen. Part of\r\nthe acid condenses in the recipient in form of a dark orange red liquid,\r\nwhile the rest combines with the water in the bottles. During the\r\ndistillation, a large quantity of oxygen gas escapes, owing to the\r\ngreater affinity of oxygen to caloric, in a high temperature, than to\r\nnitrous acid, though in the usual temperature of the atmosphere this\r\naffinity is reversed. It is from the disengagement of oxygen that the\r\nnitric acid of the neutral salt is in this operation converted into\r\nnitrous acid. It is brought back to the state of nitric acid by heating\r\nover a gentle fire, which drives off the superabundant nitrous gas, and\r\nleaves the nitric acid much diluted with water.\r\n\r\nNitric acid is procurable in a more concentrated state, and with much\r\nless loss, by mixing very dry clay with saltpetre. This mixture is put\r\ninto an earthern retort, and distilled with a strong fire. The clay\r\ncombines with the potash, for which it has great affinity, and the\r\nnitric acid passes over, slightly impregnated with nitrous gas. This is\r\neasily disengaged by heating the acid gently in a retort, a small\r\nquantity of nitrous gas passes over into the recipient, and very pure\r\nconcentrated nitric acid remains in the retort.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that azote is the nitric radical. If to 20-1/2\r\nparts, by weight, of azote 43-1/2 parts of oxygen be added, 64 parts of\r\nnitrous gas are formed; and, if to this we join 36 additional parts of\r\noxygen, 100 parts of nitric acid result from the combination.\r\nIntermediate quantities of oxygen between these two extremes of\r\noxygenation produce different species of nitrous acid, or, in other\r\nwords, nitric acid less or more impregnated with nitrous gas. I\r\nascertained the above proportions by means of decomposition; and, though\r\nI cannot answer for their absolute accuracy, they cannot be far removed\r\nfrom truth. Mr Cavendish, who first showed by synthetic experiments that\r\nazote is the base of nitric acid, gives the proportions of azote a\r\nlittle larger than I have done; but, as it is not improbable that he\r\nproduced the nitrous acid and not the nitric, that circumstance explains\r\nin some degree the difference in the results of our experiments.\r\n\r\nAs, in all experiments of a philosophical nature, the utmost possible\r\ndegree of accuracy is required, we must procure the nitric acid for\r\nexperimental purposes, from nitre which has been previously purified\r\nfrom all foreign matter. If, after distillation, any sulphuric acid is\r\nsuspected in the nitric acid, it is easily separated by dropping in a\r\nlittle nitrat of barytes, so long as any precipitation takes place; the\r\nsulphuric acid, from its greater affinity, attracts the barytes, and\r\nforms with it an insoluble neutral salt, which falls to the bottom. It\r\nmay be purified in the same manner from muriatic acid, by dropping in a\r\nlittle nitrat of silver so long as any precipitation of muriat of silver\r\nis produced. When these two precipitations are finished, distill off\r\nabout seven-eighths of the acid by a gentle heat, and what comes over is\r\nin the most perfect degree of purity.\r\n\r\nThe nitric acid is one of the most prone to combination, and is at the\r\nsame time very easily decomposed. Almost all the simple substances, with\r\nthe exception of gold, silver, and platina, rob it less or more of its\r\noxygen; some of them even decompose it altogether. It was very anciently\r\nknown, and its combinations have been more studied by chemists than\r\nthose of any other acid. These combinations were named _nitres_ by\r\nMessrs Macquer and Beaumé; but we have changed their names to nitrats\r\nand nitrites, according as they are formed by nitric or by nitrous acid,\r\nand have added the specific name of each particular base, to distinguish\r\nthe several combinations from each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Sulphuric Acid with the Salifiable Bases,\r\nin the order of affinity._\r\n\r\n_Names of the bases._      _Resulting compounds._\r\n           _New nomenclature._       _Old nomenclature._\r\n\r\nBarytes    Sulphat of barytes     Heavy spar.

XIV.--_Observations upon Sulphuric Acid and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nFor a long time this acid was procured by distillation from sulphat of\r\niron, in which sulphuric acid and oxyd of iron are combined, according\r\nto the process described by Basil Valentine in the fifteenth century;\r\nbut, in modern times, it is procured more oeconomically by the\r\ncombustion of sulphur in proper vessels. Both to facilitate the\r\ncombustion, and to assist the oxygenation of the sulphur, a little\r\npowdered saltpetre, nitrat of potash, is mixed with it; the nitre is\r\ndecomposed, and gives out its oxygen to the sulphur, which contributes\r\nto its conversion into acid. Notwithstanding this addition, the sulphur\r\nwill only continue to burn in close vessels for a limited time; the\r\ncombination ceases, because the oxygen is exhausted, and the air of the\r\nvessels reduced almost to pure azotic gas, and because the acid itself\r\nremains long in the state of vapour, and hinders the progress of\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nIn the manufactories for making sulphuric acid in the large way, the\r\nmixture of nitre and sulphur is burnt in large close built chambers\r\nlined with lead, having a little water at the bottom for facilitating\r\nthe condensation of the vapours. Afterwards, by distillation in large\r\nretorts with a gentle heat, the water passes over, slightly impregnated\r\nwith acid, and the sulphuric acid remains behind in a concentrated\r\nstate. It is then pellucid, without any flavour, and nearly double the\r\nweight of an equal bulk of water. This process would be greatly\r\nfacilitated, and the combustion much prolonged, by introducing fresh air\r\ninto the chambers, by means of several pairs of bellows directed towards\r\nthe flame of the sulphur, and by allowing the nitrous gas to escape\r\nthrough long serpentine canals, in contact with water, to absorb any\r\nsulphuric or sulphurous acid gas it might contain.\r\n\r\nBy one experiment, Mr Berthollet found that 69 parts of sulphur in\r\ncombustion, united with 31 parts of oxygen, to form 100 parts of\r\nsulphuric acid; and, by another experiment, made in a different manner,\r\nhe calculates that 100 parts of sulphuric acid consists of 72 parts\r\nsulphur, combined with 28 parts of oxygen, all by weight.\r\n\r\nThis acid, in common with every other, can only dissolve metals when\r\nthey have been previously oxydated; but most of the metals are capable\r\nof decomposing a part of the acid, so as to carry off a sufficient\r\nquantity of oxygen, to render themselves soluble in the part of the acid\r\nwhich remains undecomposed. This happens with silver, mercury, iron, and\r\nzinc, in boiling concentrated sulphuric acid; they become first\r\noxydated by decomposing part of the acid, and then dissolve in the other\r\npart; but they do not sufficiently disoxygenate the decomposed part of\r\nthe acid to reconvert it into sulphur; it is only reduced to the state\r\nof sulphurous acid, which, being volatilised by the heat, flies off in\r\nform of sulphurous acid gas.\r\n\r\nSilver, mercury, and all the other metals except iron and zinc, are\r\ninsoluble in diluted sulphuric acid, because they have not sufficient\r\naffinity with oxygen to draw it off from its combination either with the\r\nsulphur, the sulphurous acid, or the hydrogen; but iron and zinc, being\r\nassisted by the action of the acid, decompose the water, and become\r\noxydated at its expence, without the help of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of the Sulphurous Acid with the Salifiable\r\nBases, in the order of affinity._\r\n\r\n_Names of the Bases._    _Names of the Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nBarytes              Sulphite of barytes.\r\nPotash                           potash.\r\nSoda                             soda.\r\nLime                             lime.\r\nMagnesia                         magnesia.\r\nAmmoniac                         ammoniac.\r\nArgill                           argill.\r\nOxyd of zinc                     zinc.\r\n        iron                     iron.\r\n        manganese                manganese.\r\n        cobalt                   cobalt.\r\n        nickel                   nickel.\r\n        lead                     lead.\r\n        tin                      tin.\r\n        copper                   copper.\r\n        bismuth                  bismuth.\r\n        antimony                 antimony.\r\n        arsenic                  arsenic.\r\n        mercury                  mercury.\r\n        silver                   silver.\r\n        gold                     gold.\r\n        platina                  platina.\r\n\r\n_Note._--The only one of these salts known to the old chemists was the\r\nsulphite of potash, under the name of _Stahl's sulphureous salt_. So\r\nthat, before our new nomenclature, these compounds must have been named\r\n_Stahl's sulphureous salt_, having base of fixed vegetable alkali, and\r\nso of the rest.\r\n\r\nIn this Table we have followed Bergman's order of affinity of the\r\nsulphuric acid, which is the same in regard to the earths and alkalies,\r\nbut it is not certain if the order be the same for the metallic\r\noxyds.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XV.--_Observations upon Sulphurous Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nThe sulphurous acid is formed by the union of oxygen with sulphur by a\r\nlesser degree of oxygenation than the sulphuric acid. It is procurable\r\neither by burning sulphur slowly, or by distilling sulphuric acid from\r\nsilver, antimony, lead, mercury, or charcoal; by which operation a part\r\nof the oxygen quits the acid, and unites to these oxydable bases, and\r\nthe acid passes over in the sulphurous state of oxygenation. This acid,\r\nin the common pressure and temperature of the air, can only exist in\r\nform of gas; but it appears, from the experiments of Mr Clouet, that, in\r\na very low temperature, it condenses, and becomes fluid. Water absorbs a\r\ngreat deal more of this gas than of carbonic acid gas, but much less\r\nthan it does of muriatic acid gas.\r\n\r\nThat the metals cannot be dissolved in acids without being previously\r\noxydated, or by procuring oxygen, for that purpose, from the acids\r\nduring solution, is a general and well established fact, which I have\r\nperhaps repeated too often. Hence, as sulphurous acid is already\r\ndeprived of great part of the oxygen necessary for forming the sulphuric\r\nacid, it is more disposed to recover oxygen, than to furnish it to the\r\ngreatest part of the metals; and, for this reason, it cannot dissolve\r\nthem, unless previously oxydated by other means. From the same principle\r\nit is that the metallic oxyds dissolve without effervescence, and with\r\ngreat facility, in sulphurous acid. This acid, like the muriatic, has\r\neven the property of dissolving metallic oxyds surcharged with oxygen,\r\nand consequently insoluble in sulphuric acid, and in this way forms true\r\nsulphats. Hence we might be led to conclude that there are no metallic\r\nsulphites, were it not that the phenomena which accompany the solution\r\nof iron, mercury, and some other metals, convince us that these metallic\r\nsubstances are susceptible of two degrees of oxydation, during their\r\nsolution in acids. Hence the neutral salt in which the metal is least\r\noxydated must be named _sulphite_, and that in which it is fully\r\noxydated must be called _sulphat_. It is yet unknown whether this\r\ndistinction is applicable to any of the metallic sulphats, except those\r\nof iron and mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Phosphorous and Phosphoric Acids, with the\r\nSalifiable Bases, in the Order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Names of the_       _Names of the Neutral Salts formed by_\r\n   _Bases._         _Phosphorous Acid,_   _Phosphoric Acid._\r\n\r\n                   Phosphites of(B)    Phosphats of(C)\r\nLime                  lime                lime.\r\nBarytes               barytes             barytes.\r\nMagnesia              magnesia            magnesia.\r\nPotash                potash              potash.\r\nSoda                  soda                soda.\r\nAmmoniac              ammoniac            ammoniac.\r\nArgill                argill              argill.\r\nOxyds of(A)\r\n  zinc                zinc                zinc.\r\n  iron                iron                iron.\r\n  manganese           manganese           manganese.\r\n  cobalt              cobalt              cobalt.\r\n  nickel              nickel              nickel.\r\n  lead                lead                lead.\r\n  tin                 tin                 tin.\r\n  copper              copper              copper.\r\n  bismuth             bismuth             bismuth.\r\n  antimony            antimony            antimony.\r\n  arsenic             arsenic             arsenic.\r\n  mercury             mercury             mercury.\r\n  silver              silver              silver.\r\n  gold                gold                gold.\r\n  platina             platina             platina.\r\n\r\n[Note A: The existence of metallic phosphites supposes that metals are\r\nsusceptible of solution in phosphoric acid at different degrees of\r\noxygenation, which is not yet ascertained.--A.]\r\n\r\n[Note B: All the phosphites were unknown till lately, and consequently\r\nhave not hitherto received names.--A.]\r\n\r\n[Note C: The greater part of the phosphats were only discovered of late,\r\nand have not yet been named.--A.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVI.--_Observations upon Phosphorous and Phosphoric Acids, and\r\ntheir Combinations._\r\n\r\nUnder the article Phosphorus, Part II. Sect. X. we have already given a\r\nhistory of the discovery of that singular substance, with some\r\nobservations upon the mode of its existence in vegetable and animal\r\nbodies. The best method of obtaining this acid in a state of purity is\r\nby burning well purified phosphorus under bell-glasses, moistened on the\r\ninside with distilled water; during combustion it absorbs twice and a\r\nhalf its weight of oxygen; so that 100 parts of phosphoric acid is\r\ncomposed of 28-1/2 parts of phosphorus united to 71-1/2 parts of oxygen.\r\nThis acid may be obtained concrete, in form of white flakes, which\r\ngreedily attract the moisture of the air, by burning phosphorus in a dry\r\nglass over mercury.\r\n\r\nTo obtain phosphorous acid, which is phosphorus less oxygenated than in\r\nthe state of phosphoric acid, the phosphorus must be burnt by a very\r\nslow spontaneous combustion over a glass-funnel leading into a crystal\r\nphial; after a few days, the phosphorus is found oxygenated, and the\r\nphosphorous acid, in proportion as it forms, has attracted moisture from\r\nthe air, and dropped into the phial. The phosphorous acid is readily\r\nchanged into phosphoric acid by exposure for a long time to the free\r\nair; it absorbs oxygen from the air, and becomes fully oxygenated.\r\n\r\nAs phosphorus has a sufficient affinity for oxygen to attract it from\r\nthe nitric and muriatic acids, we may form phosphoric acid, by means of\r\nthese acids, in a very simple and cheap manner. Fill a tubulated\r\nreceiver, half full of concentrated nitric acid, and heat it gently,\r\nthen throw in small pieces of phosphorus through the tube, these are\r\ndissolved with effervescence and red fumes of nitrous gas fly off; add\r\nphosphorus so long as it will dissolve, and then increase the fire under\r\nthe retort to drive off the last particles of nitric acid; phosphoric\r\nacid, partly fluid and partly concrete, remains in the retort.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Carbonic Acid, with the Salifiable Bases,\r\nin the Order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Names of_                _Resulting Neutral Salts._\r\n_Bases_       _New Nomenclature._       _Old Nomenclature._\r\n\r\nBarytes   Carbonates of barytes(A)   Aërated or effervescent heavy earth.\r\n\r\nLime                    lime        {Chalk, calcareous spar,\r\n                                    {  Aërated calcareous earth.\r\n\r\nPotash                  potash      {Effervescing or aërated fixe\r\n                                    {  vegetable alkali, mephitis of\r\n                                    {  potash.\r\n\r\nSoda                    soda        {Aërated or effervescing fixed mineral\r\n                                    {  alkali, mephitic soda.\r\n\r\nMagnesia                magnesia    {Aërated, effervescing, mild, or\r\n                                    {  mephitic magnesia.\r\n\r\nAmmoniac                ammoniac    {Aërated, effervescing, mild, or\r\n                                    {  mephitic volatile alkali.\r\n\r\nArgill                  argill      {Aërated or effervescing argillaceous\r\n                                    {  earth, or earth of alum.\r\n\r\nOxyds of\r\n    zinc                zinc         Zinc spar, mephitic or aërated zinc.\r\n    iron                iron         Sparry iron-ore, mephitic or aërated iron.\r\n    manganese           manganese    Aërated manganese.\r\n    cobalt              cobalt       Aërated cobalt.\r\n    nickel              nickel       Aërated nickel.\r\n    lead                lead         Sparry lead-ore, or aërated lead.\r\n    tin                 tin          Aërated tin.\r\n    copper              copper       Aërated copper.\r\n    bismuth             bismuth      Aërated bismuth.\r\n    antimony            antimony     Aërated antimony.\r\n    arsenic             arsenic      Aërated arsenic.\r\n    mercury             mercury      Aërated mercury.\r\n    silver              silver       Aërated silver.\r\n    gold                gold         Aërated gold.\r\n    platina             platina      Aërated platina.\r\n\r\n[Note A: As these salts have only been understood of late, they have\r\nnot, properly speaking, any old names. Mr Morveau, in the First Volume\r\nof the Encyclopedia, calls them _Mephites_; Mr Bergman gives them the\r\nname of _aërated_; and Mr de Fourcroy, who calls the carbonic acid\r\n_chalky acid_, gives them the name of _chalks_.--A]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XVII.--_Observations upon Carbonic Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nOf all the known acids, the carbonic is the most abundant in nature; it\r\nexists ready formed in chalk, marble, and all the calcareous stones, in\r\nwhich it is neutralized by a particular earth called _lime_. To\r\ndisengage it from this combination, nothing more is requisite than to\r\nadd some sulphuric acid, or any other which has a stronger affinity for\r\nlime; a brisk effervescence ensues, which is produced by the\r\ndisengagement of the carbonic acid which assumes the state of gas\r\nimmediately upon being set free. This gas, incapable of being condensed\r\ninto the solid or liquid form by any degree of cold or of pressure\r\nhitherto known, unites to about its own bulk of water, and thereby forms\r\na very weak acid. It may likewise be obtained in great abundance from\r\nsaccharine matter in fermentation, but is then contaminated by a small\r\nportion of alkohol which it holds in solution.\r\n\r\nAs charcoal is the radical of this acid, we may form it artificially, by\r\nburning charcoal in oxygen gas, or by combining charcoal and metallic\r\noxyds in proper proportions; the oxygen of the oxyd combines with the\r\ncharcoal, forming carbonic acid gas, and the metal being left free,\r\nrecovers its metallic or reguline form.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted for our first knowledge of this acid to Dr Black, before\r\nwhose time its property of remaining always in the state of gas had made\r\nit to elude the researches of chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt would be a most valuable discovery to society, if we could decompose\r\nthis gas by any cheap process, as by that means we might obtain, for\r\neconomical purposes, the immense store of charcoal contained in\r\ncalcareous earths, marbles, limestones, &c. This cannot be effected by\r\nsingle affinity, because, to decompose the carbonic acid, it requires a\r\nsubstance as combustible as charcoal itself, so that we should only make\r\nan exchange of one combustible body for another not more valuable; but\r\nit may possibly be accomplished by double affinity, since this process\r\nis so readily performed by Nature, during vegetation, from the most\r\ncommon materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Muriatic Acid, with the Salifiable Bases,\r\nin the Order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Names of the_       _Resulting Neutral Salts._\r\n  _bases._    _New nomenclature._     _Old nomenclature._\r\n\r\nBarytes.

XIX.--_Observations upon Muriatic and Oxygenated Muriatic Acids,\r\nand their Combinations._\r\n\r\nMuriatic acid is very abundant in the mineral kingdom naturally combined\r\nwith different salifiable bases, especially with soda, lime, and\r\nmagnesia. In sea-water, and the water of several lakes, it is combined\r\nwith these three bases, and in mines of rock-salt it is chiefly united\r\nto soda. This acid does not appear to have been hitherto decomposed in\r\nany chemical experiment; so that we have no idea whatever of the nature\r\nof its radical, and only conclude, from analogy with the other acids,\r\nthat it contains oxygen as its acidifying principle. Mr Berthollet\r\nsuspects the radical to be of a metallic nature; but, as Nature appears\r\nto form this acid daily, in inhabited places, by combining miasmata with\r\naëriform fluids, this must necessarily suppose a metallic gas to exist\r\nin the atmosphere, which is certainly not impossible, but cannot be\r\nadmitted without proof.\r\n\r\nThe muriatic acid has only a moderate adherence to the salifiable bases,\r\nand can readily be driven from its combination with these by sulphuric\r\nacid. Other acids, as the nitric, for instance, may answer the same\r\npurpose; but nitric acid being volatile, would mix, during\r\ndistillation, with the muriatic. About one part of sulphuric acid is\r\nsufficient to decompose two parts of decrepitated sea-salt. This\r\noperation is performed in a tubulated retort, having Woulfe's apparatus,\r\n(Pl. IV. Fig. 1.), adapted to it. When all the junctures are properly\r\nlured, the sea-salt is put into the retort through the tube, the\r\nsulphuric acid is poured on, and the opening immediately closed with its\r\nground crystal stopper. As the muriatic acid can only subsist in the\r\ngaseous form in the ordinary temperature, we could not condense it\r\nwithout the presence of water. Hence the use of the water with which the\r\nbottles in Woulfe's apparatus are half filled; the muriatic acid gas,\r\ndriven off from the sea-salt in the retort, combines with the water, and\r\nforms what the old chemists called _smoaking spirit of salt_, or\r\n_Glauber's spirit of sea-salt_, which we now name _muriatic acid_.\r\n\r\nThe acid obtained by the above process is still capable of combining\r\nwith a farther dose of oxygen, by being distilled from the oxyds of\r\nmanganese, lead, or mercury, and the resulting acid, which we name\r\n_oxygenated muriatic acid_, can only, like the former, exist in the\r\ngasseous form, and is absorbed, in a much smaller quantity by water.\r\nWhen the impregnation of water with this gas is pushed beyond a certain\r\npoint, the superabundant acid precipitates to the bottom of the vessels\r\nin a concrete form. Mr Berthollet has shown that this acid is capable\r\nof combining with a great number of the salifiable bases; the neutral\r\nsalts which result from this union are susceptible of deflagrating with\r\ncharcoal, and many of the metallic substances; these deflagrations are\r\nvery violent and dangerous, owing to the great quantity of caloric which\r\nthe oxygen carries alongst with it into the composition of oxygenated\r\nmuriatic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Nitro-muriatic Acid with the Salifiable\r\nBases, in the Order of Affinity, so far as is known._\r\n\r\n_Names of the Bases._   _Names of the Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nArgill                Nitro-muriat of argill.\r\nAmmoniac                   ammoniac.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  antimony                 antimony.\r\n  silver                   silver.\r\n  arsenic                  arsenic.\r\nBarytes                    barytes.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  bismuth                  bismuth.\r\nLime                       lime.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  cobalt                   cobalt.\r\n  copper                   copper.\r\n  tin                      tin.\r\n  iron                     iron.\r\nMagnesia                   magnesia.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  manganese                manganese.\r\n  mercury                  mercury.\r\n  molybdena                molybdena.\r\n  nickel                   nickel.\r\n  gold                     gold.\r\n  platina                  platina.\r\n  lead                     lead.\r\nPotash                     potash.\r\nSoda                       soda.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  tungstein                tungstein.\r\n  zinc                     zinc.\r\n\r\n_Note._--Most of these combinations, especially those with the earths\r\nand alkalies, have been little examined, and we are yet to learn whether\r\nthey form a mixed salt in which the compound radical remains combined,\r\nor if the two acids separate, to form two distinct neutral salts.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XX.--_Observations upon the Nitro-Muriatic Acid, and its\r\nCombinations._\r\n\r\nThe nitro-muriatic acid, formerly called _aqua regia_, is formed by a\r\nmixture of nitric and muriatic acids; the radicals of these two acids\r\ncombine together, and form a compound base, from which an acid is\r\nproduced, having properties peculiar to itself, and distinct from those\r\nof all other acids, especially the property of dissolving gold and\r\nplatina.\r\n\r\nIn dissolutions of metals in this acid, as in all other acids, the\r\nmetals are first oxydated by attracting a part of the oxygen from the\r\ncompound radical. This occasions a disengagement of a particular species\r\nof gas not hitherto described, which may be called _nitro-muriatic gas_;\r\nit has a very disagreeable smell, and is fatal to animal life when\r\nrespired; it attacks iron, and causes it to rust; it is absorbed in\r\nconsiderable quantity by water, which thereby acquires some slight\r\ncharacters of acidity. I had occasion to make these remarks during a\r\ncourse of experiments upon platina, in which I dissolved a considerable\r\nquantity of that metal in nitro-muriatic acid.\r\n\r\nI at first suspected that, in the mixture of nitric and muriatic acids,\r\nthe latter attracted a part of the oxygen from the former, and became\r\nconverted into oxygenated muriatic acid, which gave it the property of\r\ndissolving gold; but several facts remain inexplicable upon this\r\nsupposition. Were it so, we must be able to disengage nitrous gas by\r\nheating this acid, which however does not sensibly happen. From these\r\nconsiderations, I am led to adopt the opinion of Mr Berthollet, and to\r\nconsider nitro-muriatic acid as a single acid, with a compound base or\r\nradical.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Fluoric Acid, with the Salifiable Bases,\r\nin the Order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Names of the Bases._   _Names of the Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nLime                  Fluat of lime.\r\nBarytes                        barytes.\r\nMagnesia                       magnesia.\r\nPotash                         potash.\r\nSoda                           soda.\r\nAmmoniac                       ammoniac.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  zinc                         zinc.\r\n  manganese                    manganese.\r\n  iron                         iron.\r\n  lead                         lead.\r\n  tin                          tin.\r\n  cobalt                       cobalt.\r\n  copper                       copper.\r\n  nickel                       nickel.\r\n  arsenic                      arsenic.\r\n  bismuth                      bismuth.\r\n  mercury                      mercury.\r\n  silver                       silver.\r\n  gold                         gold.\r\n   platina                     platina.\r\n\r\n    And by the dry way,\r\nArgill                Fluat of argill.\r\n\r\n_Note._--These combinations were entirely unknown to the old chemists,\r\nand consequently have no names in the old nomenclature.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXI.--_Observations upon the Fluoric Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nFluoric exists ready formed by Nature in the fluoric spars[42], combined\r\nwith calcareous earth, so as to form an insoluble neutral salt. To\r\nobtain it disengaged from that combination, fluor spar, or fluat of\r\nlime, is put into a leaden retort, with a proper quantity of sulphuric\r\nacid, a recipient likewise of lead, half full of water, is adapted, and\r\nfire is applied to the retort. The sulphuric acid, from its greater\r\naffinity, expels the fluoric acid which passes over and is absorbed by\r\nthe water in the receiver. As fluoric acid is naturally in the gasseous\r\nform in the ordinary temperature, we can receive it in a\r\npneumato-chemical apparatus over mercury. We are obliged to employ\r\nmetallic vessels in this process, because fluoric acid dissolves glass\r\nand silicious earth, and even renders these bodies volatile, carrying\r\nthem over with itself in distillation in the gasseous form.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mr Margraff for our first acquaintance with this\r\nacid, though, as he could never procure it free from combination with a\r\nconsiderable quantity of silicious earth, he was ignorant of its being\r\nan acid sui generis. The Duke de Liancourt, under the name of Mr\r\nBoulanger, considerably increased our knowledge of its properties; and\r\nMr Scheele seems to have exhausted the subject. The only thing remaining\r\nis to endeavour to discover the nature of the fluoric radical, of which\r\nwe cannot hitherto form any ideas, as the acid does not appear to have\r\nbeen decomposed in any experiment. It is only by means of compound\r\naffinity that experiments ought to be made with this view, with any\r\nprobability of success.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Boracic Acid, with the Salifiable Bases,\r\nin the Order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Bases._     _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nLime           Borat of lime.\r\nBarytes                 barytes.\r\nMagnesia                magnesia.\r\nPotash                  potash.\r\nSoda                    soda.\r\nAmmoniac                ammoniac.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  zinc                  zinc.\r\n  iron                  iron.\r\n  lead                  lead.\r\n  tin                   tin.\r\n  cobalt                cobalt.\r\n  copper                copper.\r\n  nickel                nickel.\r\n  mercury               mercury.\r\nArgill                  argill.\r\n\r\n_Note._--Most of these combinations were neither known nor named by the\r\nold chemists.

XXII.--_Observations upon Boracic Add and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nThis is a concrete acid, extracted from a salt procured from India\r\ncalled _borax_ or _tincall_. Although borax has been very long employed\r\nin the arts, we have as yet very imperfect knowledge of its origin, and\r\nof the methods by which it is extracted and purified; there is reason to\r\nbelieve it to be a native salt, found in the earth in certain parts of\r\nthe east, and in the water of some lakes. The whole trade of borax is in\r\nthe hands of the Dutch, who have been exclusively possessed of the art\r\nof purifying it till very lately, that Messrs L'Eguillier of Paris have\r\nrivalled them in the manufacture; but the process still remains a secret\r\nto the world.\r\n\r\nBy chemical analysis we learn that borax is a neutral salt with excess\r\nof base, consisting of soda, partly saturated with a peculiar acid long\r\ncalled _Homberg's sedative salt_, now _the boracic acid_. This acid is\r\nfound in an uncombined state in the waters of certain lakes. That of\r\nCherchiais in Italy contains 94-1/2 grains in each pint of water.\r\n\r\nTo obtain boracic acid, dissolve some borax in boiling water, filtrate\r\nthe solution, and add sulphuric acid, or any other having greater\r\naffinity to soda than the boracic acid; this latter acid is separated,\r\nand is procured in a crystalline form by cooling. This acid was long\r\nconsidered as being formed during the process by which it is obtained,\r\nand was consequently supposed to differ according to the nature of the\r\nacid employed in separating it from the soda; but it is now universally\r\nacknowledged that it is identically the same acid, in whatever way\r\nprocured, provided it be properly purified from mixture of other acids,\r\nby warning, and by repeated solution and cristallization. It is soluble\r\nboth in water and alkohol, and has the property of communicating a green\r\ncolour to the flame of that spirit. This circumstance led to a suspicion\r\nof its containing copper, which is not confirmed by any decisive\r\nexperiment. On the contrary, if it contain any of that metal, it must\r\nonly be considered as an accidental mixture. It combines with the\r\nsalifiable bases in the humid way; and though, in this manner, it is\r\nincapable of dissolving any of the metals directly, this combination is\r\nreadily affected by compound affinity.\r\n\r\nThe Table presents its combinations in the order of affinity in the\r\nhumid way; but there is a considerable change in the order when we\r\noperate via sicca; for, in that case, argill, though the last in our\r\nlist, must be placed immediately after soda.\r\n\r\nThe boracic radical is hitherto unknown; no experiments having as yet\r\nbeen able to decompose the acid; We conclude, from analogy with the\r\nother acids, that oxygen exists in its composition as the acidifying\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Arseniac Acid, with the Salifiable Bases,\r\nin the Order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Bases._                _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nLime            Arseniat of lime.\r\nBarytes                      barytes.\r\nMagnesia                     magnesia.\r\nPotash                       potash.\r\nSoda                         soda.\r\nAmmoniac                     ammoniac.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  zinc                       zinc.\r\n  manganese                  manganese.\r\n  iron                       iron.\r\n  lead                       lead.\r\n  tin                        tin.\r\n  cobalt                     cobalt.\r\n  copper                     copper.\r\n  nickel                     nickel.\r\n  bismuth                    bismuth.\r\n  mercury                    mercury.\r\n  antimony                   antimony.\r\n  silver                     silver.\r\n  gold                       gold.\r\n  platina                    platina.\r\nArgill                       argill.\r\n\r\n_Note._--This order of salts was entirely unknown to the antient\r\nchemists. Mr Macquer, in 1746, discovered the combinations of arseniac\r\nacid with potash and soda, to which he gave the name of _arsenical\r\nneutral salts_.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIII.--_Observations upon Arseniac Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nIn the Collections of the Academy for 1746, Mr Macquer shows that, when\r\na mixture of white oxyd of arsenic and nitre are subjected to the action\r\nof a strong fire, a neutral salt is obtained, which he calls _neutral\r\nsalt of arsenic_. At that time, the cause of this singular phenomenon,\r\nin which a metal acts the part of an acid, was quite unknown; but more\r\nmodern experiments teach that, during this process, the arsenic becomes\r\noxygenated, by carrying off the oxygen of the nitric acid; it is thus\r\nconverted into a real acid, and combines with the potash. There are\r\nother methods now known for oxygenating arsenic, and obtaining its acid\r\nfree from combination. The most simple and most effectual of these is as\r\nfollows: Dissolve white oxyd of arsenic in three parts, by weight, of\r\nmuriatic acid; to this solution, in a boiling state, add two parts of\r\nnitric acid, and evaporate to dryness. In this process the nitric acid\r\nis decomposed, its oxygen unites with the oxyd of arsenic, and converts\r\nit into an acid, and the nitrous radical flies off in the state of\r\nnitrous gas; whilst the muriatic acid is converted by the heat into\r\nmuriatic acid gas, and may be collected in proper vessels. The arseniac\r\nacid is entirely freed from the other acids employed during the process\r\nby heating it in a crucible till it begins to grow red; what remains is\r\npure concrete arseniac acid.\r\n\r\nMr Scheele's process, which was repeated with great success by Mr\r\nMorveau, in the laboratory at Dijon, is as follows: Distil muriatic acid\r\nfrom the black oxyd of manganese, this converts it into oxygenated\r\nmuriatic acid, by carrying off the oxygen from the manganese, receive\r\nthis in a recipient containing white oxyd of arsenic, covered by a\r\nlittle distilled water; the arsenic decomposes the oxygenated muriatic\r\nacid, by carrying off its supersaturation of oxygen, the arsenic is\r\nconverted into arseniac acid, and the oxygenated muriatic acid is\r\nbrought back to the state of common muriatic acid. The two acids are\r\nseparated by distillation, with a gentle heat increased towards the end\r\nof the operation, the muriatic acid passes over, and the arseniac acid\r\nremains behind in a white concrete form.\r\n\r\nThe arseniac acid is considerably less volatile than white oxyd of\r\narsenic; it often contains white oxyd of arsenic in solution, owing to\r\nits not being sufficiently oxygenated; this is prevented by continuing\r\nto add nitrous acid, as in the former process, till no more nitrous gas\r\nis produced. From all these observations I would give the following\r\ndefinition of arseniac acid. It is a white concrete metallic acid,\r\nformed by the combination of arsenic with oxygen, fixed in a red heat,\r\nsoluble in water, and capable of combining with many of the salifiable\r\nbases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIV.--_Observations upon Molybdic Acid, and its Combinations with\r\nAcidifiable Bases[43]._\r\n\r\nMolybdena is a particular metallic body, capable of being oxygenated, so\r\nfar as to become a true concrete acid[44]. For this purpose, one part\r\nore of molybdena, which is a natural sulphuret of that metal, is put\r\ninto a retort, with five or six parts nitric acid, diluted with a\r\nquarter of its weight of water, and heat is applied to the retort; the\r\noxygen of the nitric acid acts both upon the molybdena and the sulphur,\r\nconverting the one into molybdic, and the other into sulphuric acid;\r\npour on fresh quantities of nitric acid so long as any red fumes of\r\nnitrous gas escape; the molydbena is then oxygenated as far as is\r\npossible, and is found at the bottom of the retort in a pulverulent\r\nform, resembling chalk. It must be washed in warm water, to separate any\r\nadhering particles of sulphuric acid; and, as it is hardly soluble, we\r\nlose very little of it in this operation.

XXV.--_Observations upon Tungstic Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nTungstein is a particular metal, the ore of which has frequently been\r\nconfounded with that of tin. The specific gravity of this ore is to\r\nwater as 6 to 1; in its form of cristallization it resembles the\r\ngarnet, and varies in colour from a pearl-white to yellow and reddish;\r\nit is found in several parts of Saxony and Bohemia. The mineral called\r\n_Wolfram_, which is frequent in the mines of Cornwal, is likewise an ore\r\nof this metal. In all these ores the metal is oxydated; and, in some of\r\nthem, it appears even to be oxygenated to the state of acid, being\r\ncombined with lime into a true tungstat of lime.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the acid free, mix one part of ore of tungstein with four\r\nparts of carbonat of potash, and melt the mixture in a crucible, then\r\npowder and pour on twelve parts of boiling water, add nitric acid, and\r\nthe tungstic acid precipitates in a concrete form. Afterwards, to insure\r\nthe complete oxygenation of the metal, add more nitric acid, and\r\nevaporate to dryness, repeating this operation so long as red fumes of\r\nnitrous gas are produced. To procure tungstic acid perfectly pure, the\r\nfusion of the ore with carbonat of potash must be made in a crucible of\r\nplatina, otherwise the earth of the common crucibles will mix with the\r\nproducts, and adulterate the acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Tartarous Acid, with the Salifiable Bases,\r\nin the Order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Bases._              _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nLime                    Tartarite of lime.\r\nBarytes                              barytes.\r\nMagnesia                             magnesia.\r\nPotash                               potash.\r\nSoda                                 soda.\r\nAmmoniac                             ammoniac.\r\nArgill                               argill.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  zinc                               zinc.\r\n  iron                               iron.\r\n  manganese                          manganese.\r\n  cobalt                             cobalt.\r\n  nickel                             nickel.\r\n  lead                               lead.\r\n  tin                                tin.\r\n  copper                             copper.\r\n  bismuth                            bismuth.\r\n  antimony                           antimony.\r\n  arsenic                            arsenic.\r\n  silver                             silver.\r\n  mercury                            mercury.\r\n  gold                               gold.\r\n  platina                            platina.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVI.--_Observations upon Tartarous Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nTartar, or the concretion which fixes to the inside of vessels in which\r\nthe fermentation of wine is completed, is a well known salt, composed of\r\na peculiar acid, united in considerable excess to potash. Mr Scheele\r\nfirst pointed out the method of obtaining this acid pure. Having\r\nobserved that it has a greater affinity to lime than to potash, he\r\ndirects us to proceed in the following manner. Dissolve purified tartar\r\nin boiling water, and add a sufficient quantity of lime till the acid be\r\ncompletely saturated. The tartarite of lime which is formed, being\r\nalmost insoluble in cold water, falls to the bottom, and is separated\r\nfrom the solution of potash by decantation; it is afterwards washed in\r\ncold water, and dried; then pour on some sulphuric acid, diluted with\r\neight or nine parts of water, digest for twelve hours in a gentle heat,\r\nfrequently stirring the mixture; the sulphuric acid combines with the\r\nlime, and the tartarous acid is left free. A small quantity of gas, not\r\nhitherto examined, is disengaged during this process. At the end of\r\ntwelve hours, having decanted off the clear liquor, wash the sulphat of\r\nlime in cold water, which add to the decanted liquor, then evaporate\r\nthe whole, and the tartarous acid is obtained in a concrete form. Two\r\npounds of purified tartar, by means of from eight to ten ounces of\r\nsulphuric acid, yield about eleven ounces of tartarous acid.\r\n\r\nAs the combustible radical exists in excess, or as the acid from tartar\r\nis not fully saturated with oxygen, we call it _tartarous acid_, and the\r\nneutral salts formed by its combinations with salifiable bases\r\n_tartarites_. The base of the tartarous acid is a carbono-hydrous or\r\nhydro-carbonous radical, less oxygenated than in the oxalic acid; and it\r\nwould appear, from the experiments of Mr Hassenfratz, that azote enters\r\ninto the composition of the tartarous radical, even in considerable\r\nquantity. By oxygenating the tartarous acid, it is convertible into\r\noxalic, malic, and acetous acids; but it is probable the proportions of\r\nhydrogen and charcoal in the radical are changed during these\r\nconversions, and that the difference between these acids does not alone\r\nconsist in the different degrees of oxygenation.\r\n\r\nThe tartarous acid is susceptible of two degrees of saturation in its\r\ncombinations with the fixed alkalies; by one of these a salt is formed\r\nwith excess of acid, improperly called _cream of tartar_, which in our\r\nnew nomenclature is named _acidulous tartarite of potash_; by a second\r\nor equal degree of saturation a perfectly neutral salt is formed,\r\nformerly called _vegetable salt_, which we name _tartarite of potash_.\r\nWith soda this acid forms tartarite of soda, formerly called _sal de\r\nSeignette_, or _sal polychrest of Rochell_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVII.--_Observations upon Malic Acid, and its Combinations with\r\nthe Salifiable Bases[45]._\r\n\r\nThe malic acid exists ready formed in the sour juice of ripe and unripe\r\napples, and many other fruits, and is obtained as follows: Saturate the\r\njuice of apples with potash or soda, and add a proper proportion of\r\nacetite of lead dissolved in water; a double decomposition takes place,\r\nthe malic acid combines with the oxyd of lead and precipitates, being\r\nalmost insoluble, and the acetite of potash or soda remains in the\r\nliquor. The malat of lead being separated by decantation, is washed with\r\ncold water, and some dilute sulphuric acid is added; this unites with\r\nthe lead into an insoluble sulphat, and the malic acid remains free in\r\nthe liquor.\r\n\r\nThis acid, which is found mixed with citric and tartarous acid in a\r\ngreat number of fruits, is a kind of medium between oxalic and acetous\r\nacids being more oxygenated than the former, and less so than the\r\nlatter. From this circumstance, Mr Hermbstadt calls it _imperfect\r\nvinegar_; but it differs likewise from acetous acid, by having rather\r\nmore charcoal, and less hydrogen, in the composition of its radical.\r\n\r\nWhen an acid much diluted has been used in the foregoing process, the\r\nliquor contains oxalic as well as malic acid, and probably a little\r\ntartarous, these are separated by mixing lime-water with the acids,\r\noxalat, tartarite, and malat of lime are produced; the two former, being\r\ninsoluble, are precipitated, and the malat of lime remains dissolved;\r\nfrom this the pure malic acid is separated by the acetite of lead, and\r\nafterwards by sulphuric acid, as directed above.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Citric Acid, with the Salifiable Bases, in\r\nthe Order of Affinity(A)._\r\n\r\n_Bases._      _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nBarytes               Citrat of barytes.\r\nLime                            lime.\r\nMagnesia                        magnesia.\r\nPotash                          potash.\r\nSoda                            soda.\r\nAmmoniac                        ammoniac.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  zinc                          zinc.\r\n  manganese                     manganese.\r\n  iron                          iron.\r\n  lead                          lead.\r\n  cobalt                        cobalt.\r\n  copper                        copper.\r\n  arsenic                       arsenic.\r\n  mercury                       mercury.\r\n  antimony                      antimony.\r\n  silver                        silver.\r\n  gold                          gold.\r\n  platina                       platina.\r\nArgill                          argill.\r\n\r\n[Note A: These combinations were unknown to the ancient chemists.

XXVIII.--_Observations upon Citric Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nThe citric acid is procured by expression from lemons, and is found in\r\nthe juices of many other fruits mixed with malic acid. To obtain it pure\r\nand concentrated, it is first allowed to depurate from the mucous part\r\nof the fruit by long rest in a cool cellar, and is afterwards\r\nconcentrated by exposing it to the temperature of 4 or 5 degrees below\r\nZero, from 21° to 23° of Fahrenheit, the water is frozen, and the acid\r\nremains liquid, reduced to about an eighth part of its original bulk. A\r\nlower degree of cold would occasion the acid to be engaged amongst the\r\nice, and render it difficultly separable. This process was pointed out\r\nby Mr Georgius.\r\n\r\nIt is more easily obtained by saturating the lemon-juice with lime, so\r\nas to form a citrat of lime, which is insoluble in water; wash this\r\nsalt, and pour on a proper quantity of sulphuric acid; this forms a\r\nsulphat of lime, which precipitates and leaves the citric acid free in\r\nthe liquor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Pyro-lignous Acid with the Salifiable\r\nBases, in the Order of Affinity(A)._\r\n\r\n_Bases._          _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nLime                 Pyro-mucite of lime.\r\nBarytes                             barytes.\r\nPotash                              potash.\r\nSoda                                soda.\r\nMagnesia                            magnesia.\r\nAmmoniac                            ammoniac.\r\nOxyd of\r\n   zinc                             zinc.\r\n   manganese                        manganese.\r\n   iron                             iron.\r\n   lead                             lead.\r\n   tin                              tin.\r\n   cobalt                           cobalt.\r\n   copper                           copper.\r\n   nickel                           nickel.\r\n   arsenic                          arsenic.\r\n   bismuth                          bismuth.\r\n   mercury                          mercury.\r\n   antimony                         antimony.\r\n   silver                           silver.\r\n   gold                             gold.\r\n   platina                          platina.\r\nArgill                              argill.\r\n\r\n[Note A: The above affinities were determined by Messrs de Morveau and\r\nEloI Boursier de Clervaux.

XXIX.--_Observations upon Pyro-lignous Acid, and its\r\nCombinations._\r\n\r\nThe ancient chemists observed that most of the woods, especially the\r\nmore heavy and compact ones, gave out a particular acid spirit, by\r\ndistillation, in a naked fire; but, before Mr Goetling, who gives an\r\naccount of his experiments upon this subject in Crell's Chemical Journal\r\nfor 1779, no one had ever made any inquiry into its nature and\r\nproperties. This acid appears to be the same, whatever be the wood it is\r\nprocured from. When first distilled, it is of a brown colour, and\r\nconsiderably impregnated with charcoal and oil; it is purified from\r\nthese by a second distillation. The pyro-lignous radical is chiefly\r\ncomposed of hydrogen and charcoal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXX.--_Observations upon Pyro-tartarous Acid, and its Combinations\r\nwith the Salifiable Bases[46]._\r\n\r\nThe name of _Pyro-tartarous acid_ is given to a dilute empyreumatic acid\r\nobtained from purified acidulous tartarite of potash by distillation in\r\na naked fire. To obtain it, let a retort be half filled with powdered\r\ntartar, adapt a tubulated recipient, having a bent tube communicating\r\nwith a bell-glass in a pneumato-chemical apparatus; by gradually raising\r\nthe fire under the retort, we obtain the pyro-tartarous acid mixed with\r\noil, which is separated by means of a funnel. A vast quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid gas is disengaged during the distillation. The acid\r\nobtained by the above process is much contaminated with oil, which ought\r\nto be separated from it. Some authors advise to do this by a second\r\ndistillation; but the Dijon academicians inform us, that this is\r\nattended with great danger from explosions which take place during the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Pyro-mucous Acid, with the Salifiable\r\nBases, in the Order of Affinity(A)._\r\n\r\n_Bases._            _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nPotash                  Pyro-mucite of potash.\r\nSoda                                   soda.\r\nBarytes                                barytes.\r\nLime                                   lime.\r\nMagnesia                               magnesia.\r\nAmmoniac                               ammoniac.\r\nArgill                                 argill.\r\nOxyd of\r\n   zinc                                zinc.\r\n   manganese                           manganese.\r\n   iron                                iron.\r\n   lead                                lead.\r\n   tin                                 tin.\r\n   cobalt                              cobalt.\r\n   copper                              copper.\r\n   nickel                              nickel.\r\n   arsenic                             arsenic.\r\n   bismuth                             bismuth.\r\n   antimony                            antimony.\r\n\r\n[Note A: All these combinations were unknown to the ancient\r\nchemists.--A.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT.

XXXII.--_Observations upon Oxalic Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nThe oxalic acid is mostly prepared in Switzerland and Germany from the\r\nexpressed juice of sorrel, from which it cristallizes by being left long\r\nat rest; in this state it is partly saturated with potash, forming a\r\ntrue acidulous oxalat of potash, or salt with excess of acid. To obtain\r\nit pure, it must be formed artificially by oxygenating sugar, which\r\nseems to be the true oxalic radical. Upon one part of sugar pour six or\r\neight parts of nitric acid, and apply a gentle heat; a considerable\r\neffervescence takes place, and a great quantity of nitrous gas is\r\ndisengaged; the nitric acid is decomposed, and its oxygen unites to the\r\nsugar: By allowing the liquor to stand at rest, cristals of pure oxalic\r\nacid are formed, which must be dried upon blotting paper, to separate\r\nany remaining portions of nitric acid; and, to ensure the purity of the\r\nacid, dissolve the cristals in distilled water, and cristallize them\r\nafresh.\r\n\r\n+---------------+------------------+---------------------------------------\r\n|   _Bases._    | _Neutral salts._ |_Names of the resulting neutral salts_ |\r\n|               |                  |_according to the old nomenclature._   |\r\n|---------------+------------------+---------------------------------------+\r\n|Barytes        |Acetite of barytes{Unknown to the ancients.

The salt of sorrel, which is potash having oxalic acid\r\ncombined in excess, is named acidulous oxalat of potash in our new\r\nnomenclature.\r\n\r\nThe acid procured from sorrel has been known to chemists for more than a\r\ncentury, being mentioned by Mr Duclos in the Memoirs of the Academy for\r\n1688, and was pretty accurately described by Boerhaave; but Mr Scheele\r\nfirst showed that it contained potash, and demonstrated its identity\r\nwith the acid formed by the oxygenation of sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIII.--_Observations upon Acetous Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nThis acid is composed of charcoal and hydrogen united together, and\r\nbrought to the state of an acid by the addition of oxygen; it is\r\nconsequently formed by the same elements with the tartarous oxalic,\r\ncitric, malic acids, and others, but the elements exist in different\r\nproportions in each of these; and it would appear that the acetous acid\r\nis in a higher state of oxygenation than these other acids. I have some\r\nreason to believe that the acetous radical contains a small portion of\r\nazote; and, as this element is not contained in the radicals of any\r\nvegetable acid except the tartarous, this circumstance is one of the\r\ncauses of difference. The acetous acid, or vinegar, is produced by\r\nexposing wine to a gentle heat, with the addition of some ferment: This\r\nis usually the ley, or mother, which has separated from other vinegar\r\nduring fermentation, or some similar matter. The spiritous part of the\r\nwine, which consists of charcoal and hydrogen, is oxygenated, and\r\nconverted into vinegar: This operation can only take place with free\r\naccess of air, and is always attended by a diminution of the air\r\nemployed in consequence of the absorption of oxygen; wherefore, it ought\r\nalways to be carried on in vessels only half filled with the vinous\r\nliquor submitted to the acetous fermentation. The acid formed during\r\nthis process is very volatile, is mixed with a large proportion of\r\nwater, and with many foreign substances; and, to obtain it pure, it is\r\ndistilled in stone or glass vessels by a gentle fire. The acid which\r\npasses over in distillation is somewhat changed by the process, and is\r\nnot exactly of the same nature with what remains in the alembic, but\r\nseems less oxygenated: This circumstance has not been formerly observed\r\nby chemists.\r\n\r\nDistillation is not sufficient for depriving this acid of all its\r\nunnecessary water; and, for this purpose, the best way is by exposing it\r\nto a degree of cold from 4° to 6° below the freezing point, from 19° to\r\n23° of Fahrenheit; by this means the aqueous part becomes frozen, and\r\nleaves the acid in a liquid state, and considerably concentrated. In the\r\nusual temperature of the air, this acid can only exist in the gasseous\r\nform, and can only be retained by combination with a large proportion of\r\nwater. There are other chemical processes for obtaining the acetous\r\nacid, which consist in oxygenating the tartarous, oxalic, or malic\r\nacids, by means of nitric acid; but there is reason to believe the\r\nproportions of the elements of the radical are changed during this\r\nprocess. Mr Hassenfratz is at present engaged in repeating the\r\nexperiments by which these conversions are said to be produced.\r\n\r\nThe combinations of acetous acid with the various salifiable bases are\r\nvery readily formed; but most of the resulting neutral salts are not\r\ncristallizable, whereas those produced by the tartarous and oxalic acids\r\nare, in general, hardly soluble. Tartarite and oxalat of lime are not\r\nsoluble in any sensible degree: The malats are a medium between the\r\noxalats and acetites, with respect to solubility, and the malic acid is\r\nin the middle degree of saturation between the oxalic and acetous acids.\r\nWith this, as with all the acids, the metals require to be oxydated\r\nprevious to solution.\r\n\r\nThe ancient chemists knew hardly any of the salts formed by the\r\ncombinations of acetous acid with the salifiable bases, except the\r\nacetites of potash, soda, ammoniac, copper, and lead. Mr Cadet\r\ndiscovered the acetite of arsenic[47]; Mr Wenzel, the Dijon academicians\r\nMr de Lassone, and Mr Proust, made us acquainted with the properties of\r\nthe other acetites. From the property which acetite of potash possesses,\r\nof giving out ammoniac in distillation, there is some reason to suppose,\r\nthat, besides charcoal and hydrogen, the acetous radical contains a\r\nsmall proportion of azote, though it is not impossible but the above\r\nproduction of ammoniac may be occasioned by the decomposition of the\r\npotash.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Acetic Acid with the Salifiable Bases, in\r\nthe order of affinity._\r\n\r\n_Bases._     _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nBarytes   Acetat of barytes.\r\nPotash              potash.\r\nSoda                soda.\r\nLime                lime.\r\nMagnesia            magnesia.\r\nAmmoniac            ammoniac.\r\nOxyd of zinc        zinc.\r\n  manganese         manganese.\r\n  iron              iron.\r\n  lead              lead.\r\n  tin               tin.\r\n  cobalt            cobalt.\r\n  copper            copper.\r\n  nickel            nickel.\r\n  arsenic           arsenic.\r\n  bismuth           bismuth.\r\n  mercury           mercury.\r\n  antimony          antimony.\r\n  silver            silver.\r\n  gold              gold.\r\n  platina           platina.\r\nArgill              argill.\r\n\r\n_Note._--All these salts were unknown to the ancients; and even those\r\nchemists who are most versant in modern discoveries, are yet at a lose\r\nwhether the greater part of the salts produced by the oxygenated acetic\r\nradical belong properly to the class of acetites, or to that of\r\nacetats.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIV.--_Observations upon Acetic Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nWe have given to radical vinegar the name of acetic acid, from supposing\r\nthat it consists of the same radical with that of the acetous acid, but\r\nmore highly saturated with oxygen. According to this idea, acetic acid\r\nis the highest degree of oxygenation of which the hydro-carbonous\r\nradical is susceptible; but, although this circumstance be extremely\r\nprobable, it requires to be confirmed by farther, and more decisive\r\nexperiments, before it be adopted as an absolute chemical truth. We\r\nprocure this acid as follows: Upon three parts acetite of potash or of\r\ncopper, pour one part of concentrated sulphuric acid, and, by\r\ndistillation, a very highly concentrated vinegar is obtained, which we\r\ncall acetic acid, formerly named radical vinegar. It is not hitherto\r\nrigorously proved that this acid is more highly oxygenated than the\r\nacetous acid, nor that the difference between them may not consist in a\r\ndifferent proportion between the elements of the radical or base.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Succinic Acid with the Salifiable Bases,\r\nin the order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Bases._              _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nBarytes               Succinat of barytes.\r\nLime                              lime.\r\nPotash                            potash.\r\nSoda                              soda.\r\nAmmoniac                          ammoniac.\r\nMagnesia                          magnesia.\r\nArgill                            argill.\r\nOxyd of zinc                      zinc.\r\n  iron                            iron.\r\n  manganese                       manganese.\r\n  cobalt                          cobalt.\r\n  nickel                          nickel.\r\n  lead                            lead.\r\n  tin                             tin.\r\n  copper                          copper.\r\n  bismuth                         bismuth.\r\n  antimony                        antimony.\r\n  arsenic                         arsenic.\r\n  mercury                         mercury.\r\n  silver                          silver.\r\n  gold                            gold.\r\n  platina                         platina.\r\n\r\n_Note._--All the succinats were unknown to the ancient chemists.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXV.--_Observations upon Succinic Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nThe succinic acid is drawn from amber by sublimation in a gentle heat,\r\nand rises in a concrete form into the neck of the subliming vessel. The\r\noperation must not be pushed too far, or by too strong a fire, otherwise\r\nthe oil of the amber rises alongst with the acid. The salt is dried upon\r\nblotting paper, and purified by repeated solution and crystallization.\r\n\r\nThis acid is soluble in twenty-four times its weight of cold water, and\r\nin a much smaller quantity of hot water. It possesses the qualities of\r\nan acid in a very small degree, and only affects the blue vegetable\r\ncolours very slightly. The affinities of this acid, with the salifiable\r\nbases, are taken from Mr de Morveau, who is the first chemist that has\r\nendeavoured to ascertain them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVI.--_Observations upon Benzoic Acid, and its Combinations with\r\nSalifiable Bases[48]._\r\n\r\nThis acid was known to the ancient chemists under the name of Flowers of\r\nBenjamin, or of Benzoin, and was procured, by sublimation, from the gum\r\nor resin called Benzoin: The means of procuring it, _via humida_, was\r\ndiscovered by Mr Geoffroy, and perfected by Mr Scheele. Upon benzoin,\r\nreduced to powder, pour strong lime-water, having rather an excess of\r\nlime; keep the mixture continually stirring, and, after half an hour's\r\ndigestion, pour off the liquor, and use fresh portions of lime-water in\r\nthe same manner, so long as there is any appearance of neutralization.\r\nJoin all the decanted liquors, and evaporate, as far as possible,\r\nwithout occasioning cristallization, and, when the liquor is cold, drop\r\nin muriatic acid till no more precipitate is formed. By the former part\r\nof the process a benzoat of lime is formed, and, by the latter, the\r\nmuriatic acid combines with the lime, forming muriat of lime, which\r\nremains dissolved, while the benzoic acid, being insoluble,\r\nprecipitates in a concrete state.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVII.--_Observations upon Camphoric Acid, and its Combinations\r\nwith Salifiable Bases[49]._\r\n\r\nCamphor is a concrete essential oil, obtained, by sublimation, from a\r\nspecies of laurus which grows in China and Japan. By distilling nitric\r\nacid eight times from camphor, Mr Kosegarten converted it into an acid\r\nanalogous to the oxalic; but, as it differs from that acid in some\r\ncircumstances, we have thought necessary to give it a particular name,\r\ntill its nature be more completely ascertained by farther experiment.\r\n\r\nAs camphor is a carbono-hydrous or hydro-carbonous radical, it is easily\r\nconceived, that, by oxygenation, it should form oxalic, malic, and\r\nseveral other vegetable acids: This conjecture is rendered not\r\nimprobable by the experiments of Mr Kosegarten; and the principal\r\nphenomena exhibited in the combinations of camphoric acid with the\r\nsalifiable bases, being very similar to those of the oxalic and malic\r\nacids, lead me to believe that it consists of a mixture of these two\r\nacids.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVIII.--_Observations upon Gallic Acid, and its Combinations\r\nwith Salifiable Bases[50]._\r\n\r\nThe Gallic acid, formerly called Principle of Astringency, is obtained\r\nfrom gall nuts, either by infusion or decoction with water, or by\r\ndistillation with a very gentle heat. This acid has only been attended\r\nto within these few years. The Committee of the Dijon Academy have\r\nfollowed it through all its combinations, and give the best account of\r\nit hitherto produced. Its acid properties are very weak; it reddens the\r\ntincture of turnsol, decomposes sulphurets, and unites to all the metals\r\nwhen they have been previously dissolved in some other acid. Iron, by\r\nthis combination, is precipitated of a very deep blue or violet colour.\r\nThe radical of this acid, if it deserves the name of one, is hitherto\r\nentirely unknown; it is contained in oak willow, marsh iris, the\r\nstrawberry, nymphea, Peruvian bark, the flowers and bark of pomgranate,\r\nand in many other woods and barks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXIX.--_Observations upon Lactic Acid, and its Combinations with\r\nSalifiable Bases[51]._\r\n\r\nThe only accurate knowledge we have of this acid is from the works of Mr\r\nScheele. It is contained in whey, united to a small quantity of earth,\r\nand is obtained as follows: Reduce whey to one eighth part of its bulk\r\nby evaporation, and filtrate, to separate all its cheesy matter; then\r\nadd as much lime as is necessary to combine with the acid; the lime is\r\nafterwards disengaged by the addition of oxalic acid, which combines\r\nwith it into an insoluble neutral salt. When the oxalat of lime has been\r\nseparated by decantation, evaporate the remaining liquor to the\r\nconsistence of honey; the lactic acid is dissolved by alkohol, which\r\ndoes not unite with the sugar of milk and other foreign matters; these\r\nare separated by filtration from the alkohol and acid; and the alkohol\r\nbeing evaporated, or distilled off, leaves the lactic acid behind.\r\n\r\nThis acid unites with all the salifiable bases forming salts which do\r\nnot cristallize; and it seems considerably to resemble the acetous\r\nacid.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Saccholactic Acid with the Salifiable\r\nBases, in the Order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Bases._                 _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nLime                  Saccholat of lime.\r\nBarytes                            barytes.\r\nMagnesia                           magnesia.\r\nPotash                             potash.\r\nSoda                               soda.\r\nAmmoniac                           ammoniac.\r\nArgill                             argill.\r\nOxyd of zinc                       zinc.\r\n  manganese                        manganese.\r\n  iron                             iron.\r\n  lead                             lead.\r\n  tin                              tin.\r\n  cobalt                           cobalt.\r\n  copper                           copper.\r\n  nickel                           nickel.\r\n  arsenic                          arsenic.\r\n  bismuth                          bismuth.\r\n  mercury                          mercury.\r\n  antimony                         antimony.\r\n  silver                           silver.\r\n\r\n_Note._--All these were unknown to the ancient chemists.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT.

It is susceptible of combining with the alkalies, ammoniac, the\r\nearths, and even with the metals: Its action upon the latter is hitherto\r\nbut little known, except that, with them, it forms difficultly soluble\r\nsalts.

XLI.--_Observations upon Formic Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nThis acid was first obtained by distillation from ants, in the last\r\ncentury, by Samuel Fisher. The subject was treated of by Margraff in\r\n1749, and by Messrs Ardwisson and Ochrn of Leipsic in 1777. The formic\r\nacid is drawn from a large species of red ants, _formica rufa, Lin._\r\nwhich form large ant hills in woody places. It is procured, either by\r\ndistilling the ants with a gentle heat in a glass retort or an alembic;\r\nor, after having washed the ants in cold water, and dried them upon a\r\ncloth, by pouring on boiling water, which dissolves the acid; or the\r\nacid may be procured by gentle expression from the insects, in which\r\ncase it is stronger than in any of the former ways. To obtain it pure,\r\nwe must rectify, by means of distillation, which separates it from the\r\nuncombined oily and charry matter; and it may be concentrated by\r\nfreezing, in the manner recommended for treating the acetous acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLII.--_Observations upon Bombic Acid, and its Combinations with\r\nAcidifiable Bases[52]._\r\n\r\nThe juices of the silk worm seem to assume an acid quality when that\r\ninsect changes from a larva to a chrysalis. At the moment of its escape\r\nfrom the latter to the butterfly form, it emits a reddish liquor which\r\nreddens blue paper, and which was first attentively observed by Mr\r\nChaussier of the Dijon academy, who obtains the acid by infusing silk\r\nworm chrysalids in alkohol, which dissolves their acid without being\r\ncharged with any of the gummy parts of the insect; and, by evaporating\r\nthe alkohol, the acid remains tollerably pure. The properties and\r\naffinities of this acid are not hitherto ascertained with any precision;\r\nand we have reason to believe that analogous acids may be procured from\r\nother insects. The radical of this acid is probably, like that of the\r\nother acids from the animal kingdom, composed of charcoal, hydrogen, and\r\nazote, with the addition, perhaps, of phosphorus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of Sebacic Acid, with the Salifiable Bases,\r\nin the Order of Affinity._\r\n\r\n_Bases._                _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nBarytes                Sebat of barytes.\r\nPotash                          potash.\r\nSoda                            soda.\r\nLime                            lime.\r\nMagnesia                        magnesia.\r\nAmmoniac                        ammoniac.\r\nArgill                          argill.\r\nOxyd of\r\n  zinc                          zinc.\r\n  manganese                     manganese.\r\n  iron                          iron.\r\n  lead                          lead.\r\n  tin                           tin.\r\n  cobalt                        cobalt.\r\n  copper                        copper.\r\n  nickel                        nickel.\r\n  arsenic                       arsenic.\r\n  bismuth                       bismuth.\r\n  mercury                       mercury.\r\n  antimony                      antimony.\r\n  silver                        silver.\r\n\r\n_Note._--All these were unknown to the ancient chemists.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIII.--_Observations upon Sebacid Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nTo obtain the sebacic acid, let some suet be melted in a skillet over\r\nthe fire, alongst with some quick-lime in fine powder, and constantly\r\nstirred, raising the fire towards the end of the operation, and taking\r\ncare to avoid the vapours, which are very offensive. By this process the\r\nsebacic acid unites with the lime into a sebat of lime, which is\r\ndifficultly soluble in water; it is, however, separated from the fatty\r\nmatters with which it is mixed by solution in a large quantity of\r\nboiling water. From this the neutral salt is separated by evaporation;\r\nand, to render it pure, is calcined, redissolved, and again\r\ncristallized. After this we pour on a proper quantity of sulphuric acid,\r\nand the sebacic acid passes over by distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XLIV.--_Observations upon the Lithic Acid, and its Combinations\r\nwith the Salifiable Bases[53]._\r\n\r\nFrom the later experiments of Bergman and Scheele, the urinary calculus\r\nappears to be a species of salt with an earthy basis; it is slightly\r\nacidulous, and requires a large quantity of water for solution, three\r\ngrains being scarcely soluble in a thousand grains of boiling water, and\r\nthe greater part again cristallizes when cold. To this concrete acid,\r\nwhich Mr de Morveau calls Lithiasic Acid, we give the name of Lithic\r\nAcid, the nature and properties of which are hitherto very little known.\r\nThere is some appearance that it is an acidulous neutral salt, or acid\r\ncombined in excess with a salifiable base; and I have reason to believe\r\nthat it really is an acidulous phosphat of lime; if so, it must be\r\nexcluded from the class of peculiar acids.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the Combinations of the Prussic Acid with the Salifiable\r\nBases, in the order of affinity._\r\n\r\n_Bases._            _Neutral Salts._\r\n\r\nPotash              Prussiat of potash.\r\nSoda                            soda.\r\nAmmoniac                        ammoniac.\r\nLime                            lime.\r\nBarytes                         barytes.\r\nMagnesia                        magnesia.\r\nOxyd of zinc                    zinc.\r\n        iron                    iron.\r\n        manganese               manganese.\r\n        cobalt                  cobalt.\r\n        nickel                  nickel.\r\n        lead                    lead.\r\n        tin                     tin.\r\n        copper                  copper.\r\n        bismuth                 bismuth.\r\n        antimony                antimony.\r\n        arsenic                 arsenic.\r\n        silver                  silver.\r\n        mercury                 mercury.\r\n        gold                    gold.\r\n        platina                 platina.\r\n\r\n_Note._---All these were unknown to former chemists.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Observations upon the Prussic Acid, and its Combinations._\r\n\r\nAs the experiments which have been made hitherto upon this acid seem\r\nstill to leave a considerable degree of uncertainty with regard to its\r\nnature, I shall not enlarge upon its properties, and the means of\r\nprocuring it pure and dissengaged from combination. It combines with\r\niron, to which it communicates a blue colour, and is equally susceptible\r\nof entering into combination with most of the other metals, which are\r\nprecipitated from it by the alkalies, ammoniac, and lime, in consequence\r\nof greater affinity. The Prussic radical, from the experiments of\r\nScheele, and especially from those of Mr Berthollet, seems composed of\r\ncharcoal and azote; hence it is an acid with a double base. The\r\nphosphorus which has been found combined with it appears, from the\r\nexperiments of Mr Hassenfratz, to be only accidental.\r\n\r\nAlthough this acid combines with alkalies, earths, and metals, in the\r\nsame way with other acids, it possesses only some of the properties we\r\nhave been in use to attribute to acids, and it may consequently be\r\nimproperly ranked here in the class of acids; but, as I have already\r\nobserved, it is difficult to form a decided opinion upon the nature of\r\nthis substance until the subject has been farther elucidated by a\r\ngreater number of experiments.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] See Memoirs of the Academy for 1776, p. 671. and for 1778, p.\r\n535,--A.\r\n\r\n[37] See Part I.

On the other hand, if I had confined myself to the summary\r\ndescriptions hitherto given, beginners could have only acquired very\r\nvague conceptions of practical chemistry from my work, and must have\r\nwanted both confidence and interest in operations they could neither\r\nrepeat nor thoroughly comprehend. This want could not have been\r\nsupplied from books; for, besides that there are not any which describe\r\nthe modern instruments and experiments sufficiently at large, any work\r\nthat could have been consulted would have presented these things under a\r\nvery different order of arrangement, and in a different chemical\r\nlanguage, which must greatly tend to injure the main object of my\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by these motives, I determined to reserve, for a third part\r\nof my work, a summary description of all the instruments and\r\nmanipulations relative to elementary chemistry. I considered it as\r\nbetter placed at the end, rather than at the beginning of the book,\r\nbecause I must have been obliged to suppose the reader acquainted with\r\ncircumstances which a beginner cannot know, and must therefore have read\r\nthe elementary part to become acquainted with. The whole of this third\r\npart may therefore be considered as resembling the explanations of\r\nplates which are usually placed at the end of academic memoirs, that\r\nthey may not interrupt the connection of the text by lengthened\r\ndescription. Though I have taken great pains to render this part clear\r\nand methodical, and have not omitted any essential instrument or\r\napparatus, I am far from pretending by it to set aside the necessity of\r\nattendance upon lectures and laboratories, for such as wish to acquire\r\naccurate knowledge of the science of chemistry. These should familiarise\r\nthemselves to the employment of apparatus, and to the performance of\r\nexperiments by actual experience. _Nihil est in intellectu quod non\r\nprius fuerit in sensu_, the motto which the celebrated Rouelle caused to\r\nbe painted in large characters in a conspicuous part of his laboratory,\r\nis an important truth never to be lost sight of either by teachers or\r\nstudents of chemistry.\r\n\r\nChemical operations may be naturally divided into several classes,\r\naccording to the purposes they are intended for performing. Some may be\r\nconsidered as purely mechanical, such as the determination of the weight\r\nand bulk of bodies, trituration, levigation, searching, washing,\r\nfiltration, &c. Others may be considered as real chemical operations,\r\nbecause they are performed by means of chemical powers and agents; such\r\nare solution, fusion, &c. Some of these are intended for separating the\r\nelements of bodies from each other, some for reuniting these elements\r\ntogether; and some, as combustion, produce both these effects during the\r\nsame process.\r\n\r\nWithout rigorously endeavouring to follow the above method, I mean to\r\ngive a detail of the chemical operations in such order of arrangement as\r\nseemed best calculated for conveying instruction. I shall be more\r\nparticular in describing the apparatus connected with modern chemistry,\r\nbecause these are hitherto little known by men who have devoted much of\r\ntheir time to chemistry, and even by many professors of the science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n_Of the Instruments necessary for determining the Absolute and Specific\r\nGravities of Solid and Liquid Bodies._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best method hitherto known for determining the quantities of\r\nsubstances submitted to chemical experiment, or resulting from them, is\r\nby means of an accurately constructed beam and scales, with properly\r\nregulated weights, which well known operation is called _weighing_. The\r\ndenomination and quantity of the weights used as an unit or standard for\r\nthis purpose are extremely arbitrary, and vary not only in different\r\nkingdoms, but even in different provinces of the same kingdom, and in\r\ndifferent cities of the same province. This variation is of infinite\r\nconsequence to be well understood in commerce and in the arts; but, in\r\nchemistry, it is of no moment what particular denomination of weight be\r\nemployed, provided the results of experiments be expressed in convenient\r\nfractions of the same denomination. For this purpose, until all the\r\nweights used in society be reduced to the same standard, it will be\r\nsufficient for chemists in different parts to use the common pound of\r\ntheir own country as the unit or standard, and to express all its\r\nfractional parts in decimals, instead of the arbitrary divisions now in\r\nuse. By this means the chemists of all countries will be thoroughly\r\nunderstood by each other, as, although the absolute weights of the\r\ningredients and products cannot be known, they will readily, and without\r\ncalculation, be able to determine the relative proportions of these to\r\neach other with the utmost accuracy; so that in this way we shall be\r\npossessed of an universal language for this part of chemistry.\r\n\r\nWith this view I have long projected to have the pound divided into\r\ndecimal fractions, and I have of late succeeded through the assistance\r\nof Mr Fourche balance-maker at Paris, who has executed it for me with\r\ngreat accuracy and judgment. I recommend to all who carry on experiments\r\nto procure similar divisions of the pound, which they will find both\r\neasy and simple in its application, with a very small knowledge of\r\ndecimal fractions[54].\r\n\r\nAs the usefulness and accuracy of chemistry depends entirely upon the\r\ndetermination of the weights of the ingredients and products both before\r\nand after experiments, too much precision cannot be employed in this\r\npart of the subject; and, for this purpose, we must be provided with\r\ngood instruments. As we are often obliged, in chemical processes, to\r\nascertain, within a grain or less, the tare or weight of large and heavy\r\ninstruments, we must have beams made with peculiar niceness by accurate\r\nworkmen, and these must always be kept apart from the laboratory in some\r\nplace where the vapours of acids, or other corrosive liquors, cannot\r\nhave access, otherwise the steel will rust, and the accuracy of the\r\nbalance be destroyed. I have three sets, of different sizes, made by Mr\r\nFontin with the utmost nicety, and, excepting those made by Mr Ramsden\r\nof London, I do not think any can compare with them for precision and\r\nsensibility. The largest of these is about three feet long in the beam\r\nfor large weights, up to fifteen or twenty pounds; the second, for\r\nweights of eighteen or twenty ounces, is exact to a tenth part of a\r\ngrain; and the smallest, calculated only for weighing about one gros, is\r\nsensibly affected by the five hundredth part of a grain.\r\n\r\nBesides these nicer balances, which are only used for experiments of\r\nresearch, we must have others of less value for the ordinary purposes\r\nof the laboratory. A large iron balance, capable of weighing forty or\r\nfifty pounds within half a dram, one of a middle size, which may\r\nascertain eight or ten pounds, within ten or twelve grains, and a small\r\none, by which about a pound may be determined, within one grain.\r\n\r\nWe must likewise be provided with weights divided into their several\r\nfractions, both vulgar and decimal, with the utmost nicety, and verified\r\nby means of repeated and accurate trials in the nicest scales; and it\r\nrequires some experience, and to be accurately acquainted with the\r\ndifferent weights, to be able to use them properly. The best way of\r\nprecisely ascertaining the weight of any particular substance is to\r\nweigh it twice, once with the decimal divisions of the pound, and\r\nanother time with the common subdivisions or vulgar fractions, and, by\r\ncomparing these, we attain the utmost accuracy.\r\n\r\nBy the specific gravity of any substance is understood the quotient of\r\nits absolute weight divided by its magnitude, or, what is the same, the\r\nweight of a determinate bulk of any body. The weight of a determinate\r\nmagnitude of water has been generally assumed as unity for this purpose;\r\nand we express the specific gravity of gold, sulphuric acid, &c. by\r\nsaying, that gold is nineteen times, and sulphuric acid twice the weight\r\nof water, and so of other bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is the more convenient to assume water as unity in specific\r\ngravities, that those substances whose specific gravity we wish to\r\ndetermine, are most commonly weighed in water for that purpose. Thus, if\r\nwe wish to determine the specific gravity of gold flattened under the\r\nhammer, and supposing the piece of gold to weigh 8 oz. 4 gros 2-1/2\r\ngrs. in the air[55], it is suspended by means of a fine metallic wire\r\nunder the scale of a hydrostatic balance, so as to be entirely immersed\r\nin water, and again weighed. The piece of gold in Mr Brisson's\r\nexperiment lost by this means 3 gros 37 grs.; and, as it is evident\r\nthat the weight lost by a body weighed in water is precisely equal to\r\nthe weight of the water displaced, or to that of an equal volume of\r\nwater, we may conclude, that, in equal magnitudes, gold weighs 4893-1/2\r\ngrs. and water 253 grs. which, reduced to unity, gives 1.0000 as the\r\nspecific gravity of water, and 19.3617 for that of gold. We may operate\r\nin the same manner with all solid substances. We have rarely any\r\noccasion, in chemistry, to determine the specific gravity of solid\r\nbodies, unless when operating upon alloys or metallic glasses; but we\r\nhave very frequent necessity to ascertain that of fluids, as it is often\r\nthe only means of judging of their purity or degree of concentration.\r\n\r\nThis object may be very fully accomplished with the hydrostatic balance,\r\nby weighing a solid body; such, for example, as a little ball of rock\r\ncristal suspended by a very fine gold wire, first in the air, and\r\nafterwards in the fluid whose specific gravity we wish to discover. The\r\nweight lost by the cristal, when weighed in the liquor, is equal to that\r\nof an equal bulk of the liquid. By repeating this operation successively\r\nin water and different fluids, we can very readily ascertain, by a\r\nsimple and easy calculation, the relative specific gravities of these\r\nfluids, either with respect to each other or to water. This method is\r\nnot, however, sufficiently exact, or, at least, is rather troublesome,\r\nfrom its extreme delicacy, when used for liquids differing but little in\r\nspecific gravity from water; such, for instance, as mineral waters, or\r\nany other water containing very small portions of salt in solution.\r\n\r\nIn some operations of this nature, which have not hitherto been made\r\npublic, I employed an instrument of great sensibility for this purpose\r\nwith great advantage. It consists of a hollow cylinder, A b c f, Pl.\r\nvii. fig. 6. of brass, or rather of silver, loaded at its bottom, b c f,\r\nwith tin, as represented swimming in a jug of water, l m n o. To the\r\nupper part of the cylinder is attached a stalk of silver wire, not more\r\nthan three fourths of a line diameter, surmounted by a little cup d,\r\nintended for containing weights; upon the stalk a mark is made at g,\r\nthe use of which we shall presently explain. This cylinder may be made\r\nof any size; but, to be accurate, ought at least to displace four pounds\r\nof water. The weight of tin with which this instrument is loaded ought\r\nto be such as will make it remain almost in equilibrium in distilled\r\nwater, and should not require more than half a dram, or a dram at most,\r\nto make it sink to g.\r\n\r\nWe must first determine, with great precision, the exact weight of the\r\ninstrument, and the number of additional grains requisite for making it\r\nsink, in distilled water of a determinate temperature, to the mark: We\r\nthen perform the same experiment upon all the fluids of which we wish to\r\nascertain the specific gravity, and, by means of calculation, reduce the\r\nobserved differences to a common standard of cubic feet, pints or\r\npounds, or of decimal fractions, comparing them with water. This method,\r\njoined to experiments with certain reagents[56], is one of the best for\r\ndetermining the quality of waters, and is even capable of pointing out\r\ndifferences which escape the most accurate chemical analysis. I shall,\r\nat some future period, give an account of a very extensive set of\r\nexperiments which I have made upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThese metallic hydrometers are only to be used for determining the\r\nspecific gravities of such waters as contain only neutral salts or\r\nalkaline substances; and they may be constructed with different degrees\r\nof ballast for alkohol and other spiritous liquors. When the specific\r\ngravities of acid liquors are to be ascertained, we must use a glass\r\nhydrometer, as represented Pl. vii. fig. 14[57]. This consists of a\r\nhollow cylinder of glass, a b c f, hermetically sealed at its lower\r\nend, and drawn out at the upper into a capillary tube a, ending in the\r\nlittle cup or bason d. This instrument is ballasted with more or less\r\nmercury, at the bottom of the cylinder introduced through the tube, in\r\nproportion to the weight of the liquor intended to be examined: We may\r\nintroduce a small graduated slip of paper into the tube a d; and,\r\nthough these degrees do not exactly correspond to the fractions of\r\ngrains in the different liquors, they may be rendered very useful in\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nWhat is said in this chapter may suffice, without farther enlargement,\r\nfor indicating the means of ascertaining the absolute and specific\r\ngravities of solids and fluids, as the necessary instruments are\r\ngenerally known, and may easily be procured: But, as the instruments I\r\nhave used for measuring the gasses are not any where described, I shall\r\ngive a more detailed account of these in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] Mr Lavoisier gives, in this part of his work, very accurate\r\ndirections for reducing the common subdivisions of the French pound into\r\ndecimal fractions, and _vice versa_, by means of tables subjoined to\r\nthis 3d part. As these instructions, and the table, would be useless to\r\nthe British chemist, from the difference between the subdivisions of the\r\nFrench and Troy pounds, I have omitted them, but have subjoined in the\r\nappendix accurate rules for converting the one into the other.--E.\r\n\r\n[55] Vide Mr Brisson's Essay upon Specific Gravity, p. 5.--A.\r\n\r\n[56] For the use of these reagents see Bergman's excellent treatise upon\r\nthe analysis of mineral waters, in his Chemical and Physical Essays.--E.\r\n\r\n[57] Three or four years ago, I have seen similar glass hydrometers,\r\nmade for Dr Black by B. Knie, a very ingenious artist of this city.--E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_Of Gazometry, or the Measurement of the Weight and Volume of Aëriform\r\nSubstances._\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n_Description of the Pneumato-chemical Apparatus._\r\n\r\nThe French chemists have of late applied the name of _pneumato-chemical\r\napparatus_ to the very simple and ingenious contrivance, invented by Dr\r\nPriestley, which is now indispensibly necessary to every laboratory.\r\nThis consists of a wooden trough, of larger or smaller dimensions as is\r\nthought convenient, lined with plate-lead or tinned copper, as\r\nrepresented in perspective, Pl. V. In Fig. 1. the same trough or cistern\r\nis supposed to have two of its sides cut away, to show its interior\r\nconstruction more distinctly. In this apparatus, we distinguish between\r\nthe shelf ABCD Fig. 1. and 2. and the bottom or body of the cistern FGHI\r\nFig. 2. The jars or bell-glasses are filled with water in this deep\r\npart, and, being turned with their mouths downwards, are afterwards set\r\nupon the shelf ABCD, as shown Plate X. Fig. 1. F. The upper parts of the\r\nsides of the cistern above the level of the shelf are called the _rim_\r\nor _borders_.\r\n\r\nThe cistern ought to be filled with water, so as to stand at least an\r\ninch and a half deep upon the shelf, and it should be of such dimensions\r\nas to admit of at least one foot of water in every direction in the\r\nwell. This size is sufficient for ordinary occasions; but it is often\r\nconvenient, and even necessary, to have more room; I would therefore\r\nadvise such as intend to employ themselves usefully in chemical\r\nexperiments, to have this apparatus made of considerable magnitude,\r\nwhere their place of operating will allow. The well of my principal\r\ncistern holds four cubical feet of water, and its shelf has a surface of\r\nfourteen square feet; yet, in spite of this size, which I at first\r\nthought immoderate, I am often straitened for room.\r\n\r\nIn laboratories, where a considerable number of experiments are\r\nperformed, it is necessary to have several lesser cisterns, besides the\r\nlarge one, which may be called the _general magazine_; and even some\r\nportable ones, which may be moved when necessary, near a furnace, or\r\nwherever they may be wanted. There are likewise some operations which\r\ndirty the water of the apparatus, and therefore require to be carried\r\non in cisterns by themselves.\r\n\r\nIt were doubtless considerably cheaper to use cisterns, or iron-bound\r\ntubs, of wood simply dove-tailed, instead of being lined with lead or\r\ncopper; and in my first experiments I used them made in that way; but I\r\nsoon discovered their inconvenience. If the water be not always kept at\r\nthe same level, such of the dovetails as are left dry shrink, and, when\r\nmore water is added, it escapes through the joints, and runs out.\r\n\r\nWe employ cristal jars or bell glasses, Pl. V. Fig. 9. A. for containing\r\nthe gasses in this apparatus; and, for transporting these, when full of\r\ngas, from one cistern to another, or for keeping them in reserve when\r\nthe cistern is too full, we make use of a flat dish BC, surrounded by a\r\nstanding up rim or border, with two handles DE for carrying it by.\r\n\r\nAfter several trials of different materials, I have found marble the\r\nbest substance for constructing the mercurial pneumato-chemical\r\napparatus, as it is perfectly impenetrable by mercury, and is not\r\nliable, like wood, to separate at the junctures, or to allow the mercury\r\nto escape through chinks; neither does it run the risk of breaking, like\r\nglass, stone-ware, or porcelain. Take a block of marble BCDE, Plate V.\r\nFig. 3. and 4. about two feet long, 15 or 18 inches broad, and ten\r\ninches thick, and cause it to be hollowed out as at m n Fig. 5. about\r\nfour inches deep, as a reservoir for the mercury; and, to be able more\r\nconveniently to fill the jars, cut the gutter T V, Fig. 3. 4. and 5. at\r\nleast four inches deeper; and, as this trench may sometimes prove\r\ntroublesome, it is made capable of being covered at pleasure by thin\r\nboards, which slip into the grooves x y, Fig. 5. I have two marble\r\ncisterns upon this construction, of different sizes, by which I can\r\nalways employ one of them as a reservoir of mercury, which it preserves\r\nwith more safety than any other vessel, being neither subject to\r\noverturn, nor to any other accident. We operate with mercury in this\r\napparatus exactly as with water in the one before described; but the\r\nbell-glasses must be of smaller diameter, and much stronger; or we may\r\nuse glass tubes, having their mouths widened, as in Fig. 7.; these are\r\ncalled _eudiometers_ by the glass-men who sell them. One of the\r\nbell-glasses is represented Fig. 5. A. standing in its place, and what\r\nis called a jar is engraved Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nThe mercurial pneumato-chemical apparatus is necessary in all\r\nexperiments wherein the disengaged gasses are capable of being absorbed\r\nby water, as is frequently the case, especially in all combinations,\r\nexcepting those of metals, in fermentation, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n_Of the Gazometer._\r\n\r\nI give the name of _gazometer_ to an instrument which I invented, and\r\ncaused construct, for the purpose of a kind of bellows, which might\r\nfurnish an uniform and continued stream of oxygen gas in experiments of\r\nfusion. Mr Meusnier and I have since made very considerable corrections\r\nand additions, having converted it into what may be called an _universal\r\ninstrument_, without which it is hardly possible to perform most of the\r\nvery exact experiments. The name we have given the instrument indicates\r\nits intention for measuring the volume or quantity of gas submitted to\r\nit for examination.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a strong iron beam, DE, Pl. VIII. Fig. 1. three feet\r\nlong, having at each end, D and E, a segment of a circle, likewise\r\nstrongly constructed of iron, and very firmly joined. Instead of being\r\npoised as in ordinary balances, this beam rests, by means of a\r\ncylindrical axis of polished steel, F, Fig. 9. upon two large moveable\r\nbrass friction-wheels, by which the resistance to its motion from\r\nfriction is considerably diminished, being converted into friction of\r\nthe second order. As an additional precaution, the parts of these wheels\r\nwhich support the axis of the beam are covered with plates of polished\r\nrock-cristal. The whole of this machinery is fixed to the top of the\r\nsolid column of wood BC, Fig. 1. To one extremity D of the beam, a scale\r\nP for holding weights is suspended by a flat chain, which applies to the\r\ncurvature of the arc nDo, in a groove made for the purpose. To the\r\nother extremity E of the beam is applied another flat chain, i k m, so\r\nconstructed, as to be incapable of lengthening or shortening, by being\r\nless or more charged with weight; to this chain, an iron trivet, with\r\nthree branches, a i, c i, and h i, is strongly fixed at i, and\r\nthese branches support a large inverted jar A, of hammered copper, of\r\nabout 18 inches diameter, and 20 inches deep. The whole of this machine\r\nis represented in perspective, Pl. VIII. Fig. 1. and Pl. IX. Fig. 2. and\r\n4. give perpendicular sections, which show its interior structure.\r\n\r\nRound the bottom of the jar, on its outside, is fixed (Pl. IX. Fig. 2.)\r\na border divided into compartments 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. intended to receive\r\nleaden weights separately represented 1, 2, 3, Fig. 3. These are\r\nintended for increasing the weight of the jar when a considerable\r\npressure is requisite, as will be afterwards explained, though such\r\nnecessity seldom occurs. The cylindrical jar A is entirely open below,\r\nde, Pl. IX. Fig. 4.; but is closed above with a copper lid, a b c,\r\nopen at b f, and capable of being shut by the cock g. This lid, as may\r\nbe seen by inspecting the figures, is placed a few inches within the top\r\nof the jar to prevent the jar from being ever entirely immersed in the\r\nwater, and covered over. Were I to have this instrument made over again,\r\nI should cause the lid to be considerably more flattened, so as to be\r\nalmost level. This jar or reservoir of air is contained in the\r\ncylindrical copper vessel, LMNO, Pl. VIII. Fig. 1. filled with water.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the cylindrical vessel LMNO, Pl. IX. Fig. 4. are placed\r\ntwo tubes st, xy, which are made to approach each other at their upper\r\nextremities t y; these are made of such a length as to rise a little\r\nabove the upper edge LM of the vessel LMNO, and when the jar abcde\r\ntouches the bottom NO, their upper ends enter about half an inch into\r\nthe conical hollow b, leading to the stop-cock g.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the vessel LMNO is represented Pl. IX. Fig. 3. in the\r\nmiddle of which a small hollow semispherical cap is soldered, which may\r\nbe considered as the broad end of a funnel reversed; the two tubes st,\r\nxy, Fig. 4. are adapted to this cap at s and x, and by this means\r\ncommunicate with the tubes mm, nn, oo, pp, Fig. 3. which are fixed\r\nhorizontally upon the bottom of the vessel, and all of which terminate\r\nin, and are united by, the spherical cap sx. Three of these tubes are\r\ncontinued out of the vessel, as in Pl. VIII. Fig. 1. The first marked in\r\nthat figure 1, 2, 3, is inserted at its extremity 3, by means of an\r\nintermediate stop-cock 4, to the jar V. which stands upon the shelf of a\r\nsmall pneumato-chemical apparatus GHIK, the inside of which is shown Pl.\r\nIX. Fig. 1. The second tube is applied against the outside of the vessel\r\nLMNO from 6 to 7, is continued at 8, 9, 10, and at 11 is engaged below\r\nthe jar V. The former of these tubes is intended for conveying gas into\r\nthe machine, and the latter for conducting small quantities for trials\r\nunder jars. The gas is made either to flow into or out of the machine,\r\naccording to the degree of pressure it receives; and this pressure is\r\nvaried at pleasure, by loading the scale P less or more, by means of\r\nweights. When gas is to be introduced into the machine, the pressure is\r\ntaken off, or even rendered negative; but, when gas is to be expelled, a\r\npressure is made with such degree of force as is found necessary.\r\n\r\nThe third tube 12, 13, 14, 15, is intended for conveying air or gas to\r\nany necessary place or apparatus for combustions, combinations, or any\r\nother experiment in which it is required.\r\n\r\nTo explain the use of the fourth tube, I must enter into some\r\ndiscussions. Suppose the vessel LMNO, Pl. VIII. Fig. 1. full of water,\r\nand the jar A partly filled with gas, and partly with water; it is\r\nevident that the weights in the bason P may be so adjusted, as to\r\noccasion an exact equilibrium between the weight of the bason and of the\r\njar, so that the external air shall not tend to enter into the jar, nor\r\nthe gas to escape from it; and in this case the water will stand exactly\r\nat the same level both within and without the jar. On the contrary, if\r\nthe weight in the bason P be diminished, the jar will then press\r\ndownwards from its own gravity, and the water will stand lower within\r\nthe jar than it does without; in this case, the included air or gas will\r\nsuffer a degree of compression above that experienced by the external\r\nair, exactly proportioned to the weight of a column of water, equal to\r\nthe difference of the external and internal surfaces of the water. From\r\nthese reflections, Mr Meusnier contrived a method of determining the\r\nexact degree of pressure to which the gas contained in the jar is at any\r\ntime exposed. For this purpose, he employs a double glass syphon 19, 20,\r\n21, 22, 23, firmly cemented at 19 and 23. The extremity 19 of this\r\nsyphon communicates freely with the water in the external vessel of the\r\nmachine, and the extremity 23 communicates with the fourth tube at the\r\nbottom of the cylindrical vessel, and consequently, by means of the\r\nperpendicular tube st, Pl. IX. Fig. 4. with the air contained in the\r\njar. He likewise cements, at 16, Pl. VIII. Fig. 1. another glass tube\r\n16, 17, 18, which communicates at 16 with the water in the exterior\r\nvessel LMNO, and, at its upper end 18, is open to the external air.\r\n\r\nBy these several contrivances, it is evident that the water must stand\r\nin the tube 16, 17, 18, at the same level with that in the cistern LMNO;\r\nand, on the contrary, that, in the branch 19, 20, 21, it must stand\r\nhigher or lower, according as the air in the jar is subjected to a\r\ngreater or lesser pressure than the external air. To ascertain these\r\ndifferences, a brass scale divided into inches and lines is fixed\r\nbetween these two tubes. It is readily conceived that, as air, and all\r\nother elastic fluids, must increase in weight by compression, it is\r\nnecessary to know their degree of condensation to be enabled to\r\ncalculate their quantities, and to convert the measure of their volumes\r\ninto correspondent weights; and this object is intended to be fulfilled\r\nby the contrivance now described.\r\n\r\nBut, to determine the specific gravity of air or of gasses, and to\r\nascertain their weight in a known volume, it is necessary to know their\r\ntemperature, as well as the degree of pressure under which they subsist;\r\nand this is accomplished by means of a small thermometer, strongly\r\ncemented into a brass collet, which screws into the lid of the jar A.\r\nThis thermometer is represented separately, Pl. VIII. Fig. 10. and in\r\nits place 24, 25, Fig. 1. and Pl. IX. Fig. 4. The bulb is in the inside\r\nof the jar A, and its graduated stalk rises on the outside of the lid.\r\n\r\nThe practice of gazometry would still have laboured under great\r\ndifficulties, without farther precautions than those above described.\r\nWhen the jar A sinks in the water of the cistern LMNO, it must lose a\r\nweight equal to that of the water which it displaces; and consequently\r\nthe compression which it makes upon the contained air or gas must be\r\nproportionally diminished. Hence the gas furnished, during experiments\r\nfrom the machine, will not have the same density towards the end that it\r\nhad at the beginning, as its specific gravity is continually\r\ndiminishing. This difference may, it is true, be determined by\r\ncalculation; but this would have occasioned such mathematical\r\ninvestigations as must have rendered the use of this apparatus both\r\ntroublesome and difficult. Mr Meusnier has remedied this inconvenience\r\nby the following contrivance. A square rod of iron, 26, 27, Pl. VIII.\r\nFig. 1. is raised perpendicular to the middle of the beam DE. This rod\r\npasses through a hollow box of brass 28, which opens, and may be filled\r\nwith lead; and this box is made to slide alongst the rod, by means of a\r\ntoothed pinion playing in a rack, so as to raise or lower the box, and\r\nto fix it at such places as is judged proper.\r\n\r\nWhen the lever or beam DE stands horizontal, this box gravitates to\r\nneither side; but, when the jar A sinks into the cistern LMNO, so as to\r\nmake the beam incline to that side, it is evident the loaded box 28,\r\nwhich then passes beyond the center of suspension, must gravitate to the\r\nside of the jar, and augment its pressure upon the included air. This is\r\nincreased in proportion as the box is raised towards 27, because the\r\nsame weight exerts a greater power in proportion to the length of the\r\nlever by which it acts. Hence, by moving the box 28 alongst the rod 26,\r\n27, we can augment or diminish the correction it is intended to make\r\nupon the pressure of the jar; and both experience and calculation show\r\nthat this may be made to compensate very exactly for the loss of weight\r\nin the jar at all degrees of pressure.\r\n\r\nI have not hitherto explained the most important part of the use of this\r\nmachine, which is the manner of employing it for ascertaining the\r\nquantities of the air or gas furnished during experiments. To determine\r\nthis with the most rigorous precision, and likewise the quantity\r\nsupplied to the machine from experiments, we fixed to the arc which\r\nterminates the arm of the beam E, Pl. VIII. Fig. 1. the brass sector l\r\nm, divided into degrees and half degrees, which consequently moves in\r\ncommon with the beam; and the lowering of this end of the beam is\r\nmeasured by the fixed index 29, 30, which has a Nonius giving hundredth\r\nparts of a degree at its extremity 30.\r\n\r\nThe whole particulars of the different parts of the above described\r\nmachine are represented in Plate VIII. as follow.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. Is the flat chain invented by Mr Vaucanson, and employed for\r\nsuspending the scale or bason P, Fig. 1; but, as this lengthens or\r\nshortens according as it is more or less loaded, it would not have\r\nanswered for suspending the jar A, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nFig. 5. Is the chain i k m, which in Fig. 1. sustains the jar A. This\r\nis entirely formed of plates of polished iron interlaced into each\r\nother, and held together by iron pins. This chain does not lengthen in\r\nany sensible degree, by any weight it is capable of supporting.\r\n\r\nFig. 6.

The thermometer for determining the temperature of the air or\r\ngas contained in the jar.\r\n\r\nWhen this gazometer is to be used, the cistern or external vessel, LMNO,\r\nPl. VIII. Fig. 1. is to be filled with water to a determinate height,\r\nwhich should be the same in all experiments. The level of the water\r\nshould be taken when the beam of the balance stands horizontal; this\r\nlevel, when the jar is at the bottom of the cistern, is increased by all\r\nthe water which it displaces, and is diminished in proportion as the jar\r\nrises to its highest elevation. We next endeavour, by repeated trials,\r\nto discover at what elevation the box 28 must be fixed, to render the\r\npressure equal in all situations of the beam. I should have said nearly,\r\nbecause this correction is not absolutely rigorous; and differences of a\r\nquarter, or even of half a line, are not of any consequence. This height\r\nof the box 28 is not the same for every degree of pressure, but varies\r\naccording as this is of one, two, three, or more inches. All these\r\nshould be registered with great order and precision.\r\n\r\nWe next take a bottle which holds eight or ten pints, the capacity of\r\nwhich is very accurately determined by weighing the water it is capable\r\nof containing. This bottle is turned bottom upwards, full of water, in\r\nthe cistern of the pneumato chemical apparatus GHIK, Fig. 1. and is set\r\non its mouth upon the shelf of the apparatus, instead of the glass jar\r\nV, having the extremity 11 of the tube 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, inserted into\r\nits mouth. The machine is fixed at zero of pressure, and the degree\r\nmarked by the index 30 upon the sector m l is accurately observed;\r\nthen, by opening the stop-cock 8, and pressing a little upon the jar A,\r\nas much air is forced into the bottle as fills it entirely. The degree\r\nmarked by the index upon the sector is now observed, and we calculate\r\nwhat number of cubical inches correspond to each degree. We then fill a\r\nsecond and third bottle, and so on, in the same manner, with the same\r\nprecautions, and even repeat the operation several times with bottles of\r\ndifferent sizes, till at last, by accurate attention, we ascertain the\r\nexact gage or capacity of the jar A, in all its parts; but it is better\r\nto have it formed at first accurately cylindrical, by which we avoid\r\nthese calculations and estimates.\r\n\r\nThe instrument I have been describing was constructed with great\r\naccuracy and uncommon skill by Mr Meignie junior, engineer and physical\r\ninstrument-maker. It is a most valuable instrument, from the great\r\nnumber of purposes to which it is applicable; and, indeed, there are\r\nmany experiments which are almost impossible to be performed without it.\r\nIt becomes expensive, because, in many experiments, such as the\r\nformation of water and of nitric acid, it is absolutely necessary to\r\nemploy two of the same machines. In the present advanced state of\r\nchemistry, very expensive and complicated instruments are become\r\nindispensibly necessary for ascertaining the analysis and synthesis of\r\nbodies with the requisite precision as to quantity and proportion; it is\r\ncertainly proper to endeavour to simplify these, and to render them less\r\ncostly; but this ought by no means to be attempted at the expence of\r\ntheir conveniency of application, and much less of their accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\n_Some other methods of measuring the volume of Gasses._\r\n\r\nThe gazometer described in the foregoing section is too costly and too\r\ncomplicated for being generally used in laboratories for measuring the\r\ngasses, and is not even applicable to every circumstance of this kind.\r\nIn numerous series of experiments, more simple and more readily\r\napplicable methods must be employed. For this purpose I shall describe\r\nthe means I used before I was in possession of a gazometer, and which I\r\nstill use in preference to it in the ordinary course of my experiments.\r\n\r\nSuppose that, after an experiment, there is a residuum of gas, neither\r\nabsorbable by alkali nor water, contained in the upper part of the jar\r\nAEF, Pl. IV. Fig. 3. standing on the shelf of a pneumato-chemical\r\napparatus, of which we wish to ascertain the quantity, we must first\r\nmark the height to which the mercury or water rises in the jar with\r\ngreat exactness, by means of slips of paper pasted in several parts\r\nround the jar. If we have been operating in mercury, we begin by\r\ndisplacing the mercury from the jar, by introducing water in its stead.\r\nThis is readily done by filling a bottle quite full of water; having\r\nstopped it with your finger, turn it up, and introduce its mouth below\r\nthe edge of the jar; then, turning down its body again, the mercury, by\r\nits gravity, falls into the bottle, and the water rises in the jar, and\r\ntakes the place occupied by the mercury. When this is accomplished, pour\r\nso much water into the cistern ABCD as will stand about an inch over the\r\nsurface of the mercury; then pass the dish BC, Pl. V. Fig. 9. under the\r\njar, and carry it to the water cistern, Fig. 1. and 2. We here exchange\r\nthe gas into another jar, which has been previously graduated in the\r\nmanner to be afterwards described; and we thus judge of the quantity or\r\nvolume of the gas by means of the degrees which it occupies in the\r\ngraduated jar.\r\n\r\nThere is another method of determining the volume of gas, which may\r\neither be substituted in place of the one above described, or may be\r\nusefully employed as a correction or proof of that method. After the air\r\nor gas is exchanged from the first jar, marked with slips of paper, into\r\nthe graduated jar, turn up the mouth of the marked jar, and fill it with\r\nwater exactly to the marks EF, Pl. IV. Fig. 3. and by weighing the water\r\nwe determine the volume of the air or gas it contained, allowing one\r\ncubical foot, or 1728 cubical inches, of water for each 70 pounds,\r\nFrench weight.\r\n\r\nThe manner of graduating jars for this purpose is very easy, and we\r\nought to be provided with several of different sizes, and even several\r\nof each size, in case of accidents. Take a tall, narrow, and strong\r\nglass jar, and, having filled it with water in the cistern, Pl. V. Fig.\r\n1. place it upon the shelf ABCD; we ought always to use the same place\r\nfor this operation, that the level of the shelf may be always exactly\r\nsimilar, by which almost the only error to which this process is liable\r\nwill be avoided. Then take a narrow mouthed phial which holds exactly 6\r\noz. 3 gros 61 grs. of water, which corresponds to 10 cubical\r\ninches. If you have not one exactly of this dimension, choose one a\r\nlittle larger, and diminish its capacity to the size requisite, by\r\ndropping in a little melted wax and rosin. This bottle serves the\r\npurpose of a standard for gaging the jars. Make the air contained in\r\nthis bottle pass into the jar, and mark exactly the place to which the\r\nwater has descended; add another measure of air, and again mark the\r\nplace of the water, and so on, till all the water be displaced. It is of\r\ngreat consequence that, during the course of this operation, the bottle\r\nand jar be kept at the same temperature with the water in the cistern;\r\nand, for this reason, we must avoid keeping the hands upon either as\r\nmuch as possible; or, if we suspect they have been heated, we must cool\r\nthem by means of the water in the cistern. The height of the barometer\r\nand thermometer during this experiment is of no consequence.\r\n\r\nWhen the marks have been thus ascertained upon the jar for every ten\r\ncubical inches, we engrave a scale upon one of its sides, by means of a\r\ndiamond pencil. Glass tubes are graduated in the same manner for using\r\nin the mercurial apparatus, only they must be divided into cubical\r\ninches, and tenths of a cubical inch. The bottle used for gaging these\r\nmust hold 8 oz. 6 gros 25 grs. of mercury, which exactly\r\ncorresponds to a cubical inch of that metal.\r\n\r\nThe method of determining the volume of air or gas, by means of a\r\ngraduated jar, has the advantage of not requiring any correction for the\r\ndifference of height between the surface of the water within the jar,\r\nand in the cistern; but it requires corrections with respect to the\r\nheight of the barometer and thermometer. But, when we ascertain the\r\nvolume of air by weighing the water which the jar is capable of\r\ncontaining, up to the marks EF, it is necessary to make a farther\r\ncorrection, for the difference between the surface of the water in the\r\ncistern, and the height to which it rises within the jar. This will be\r\nexplained in the fifth section of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.\r\n\r\n_Of the method of Separating the different Gasses from each other._\r\n\r\nAs experiments often produce two, three, or more species of gas, it is\r\nnecessary to be able to separate these from each other, that we may\r\nascertain the quantity and species of each. Suppose that under the jar\r\nA, Pl. IV. Fig. 3. is contained a quantity of different gasses mixed\r\ntogether, and standing over mercury, we begin by marking with slips of\r\npaper, as before directed, the height at which the mercury stands within\r\nthe glass; then introduce about a cubical inch of water into the jar,\r\nwhich will swim over the surface of the mercury: If the mixture of gas\r\ncontains any muriatic or sulphurous acid gas, a rapid and considerable\r\nabsorption will instantly take place, from the strong tendency these two\r\ngasses have, especially the former, to combine with, or be absorbed by\r\nwater. If the water only produces a slight absorption of gas hardly\r\nequal to its own bulk, we conclude, that the mixture neither contains\r\nmuriatic acid, sulphuric acid, or ammoniacal gas, but that it contains\r\ncarbonic acid gas, of which water only absorbs about its own bulk. To\r\nascertain this conjecture, introduce some solution of caustic alkali,\r\nand the carbonic acid gas will be gradually absorbed in the course of a\r\nfew hours; it combines with the caustic alkali or potash, and the\r\nremaining gas is left almost perfectly free from any sensible residuum\r\nof carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nAfter each experiment of this kind, we must carefully mark the height at\r\nwhich the mercury stands within the jar, by slips of paper pasted on,\r\nand varnished over when dry, that they may not be washed off when placed\r\nin the water apparatus. It is likewise necessary to register the\r\ndifference between the surface of the mercury in the cistern and that in\r\nthe jar, and the height of the barometer and thermometer, at the end of\r\neach experiment.\r\n\r\nWhen all the gas or gasses absorbable by water and potash are absorbed,\r\nwater is admitted into the jar to displace the mercury; and, as is\r\ndescribed in the preceding section, the mercury in the cistern is to be\r\ncovered by one or two inches of water. After this, the jar is to be\r\ntransported by means of the flat dish BC, Pl. V. Fig. 9. into the water\r\napparatus; and the quantity of gas remaining is to be ascertained by\r\nchanging it into a graduated jar. After this, small trials of it are to\r\nbe made by experiments in little jars, to ascertain nearly the nature of\r\nthe gas in question. For instance, into a small jar full of the gas,\r\nFig. 8. Pl. V. a lighted taper is introduced; if the taper is not\r\nimmediately extinguished, we conclude the gas to contain oxygen gas;\r\nand, in proportion to the brightness of the flame, we may judge if it\r\ncontain less or more oxygen gas than atmospheric air contains. If, on\r\nthe contrary, the taper be instantly extinguished, we have strong reason\r\nto presume that the residuum is chiefly composed of azotic gas. If, upon\r\nthe approach of the taper, the gas takes fire and burns quietly at the\r\nsurface with a white flame, we conclude it to be pure hydrogen gas; if\r\nthis flame is blue, we judge it consists of carbonated hydrogen gas;\r\nand, if it takes fire with a sudden deflagration, that it is a mixture\r\nof oxygen and hydrogen gas. If, again, upon mixing a portion of the\r\nresiduum with oxygen gas, red fumes are produced, we conclude that it\r\ncontains nitrous gas.\r\n\r\nThese preliminary trials give some general knowledge of the properties\r\nof the gas, and nature of the mixture, but are not sufficient to\r\ndetermine the proportions and quantities of the several gasses of which\r\nit is composed. For this purpose all the methods of analysis must be\r\nemployed; and, to direct these properly, it is of great use to have a\r\nprevious approximation by the above methods. Suppose, for instance, we\r\nknow that the residuum consists of oxygen and azotic gas mixed together,\r\nput a determinate quantity, 100 parts, into a graduated tube of ten or\r\ntwelve lines diameter, introduce a solution of sulphuret of potash in\r\ncontact with the gas, and leave them together for some days; the\r\nsulphuret absorbs the whole oxygen gas, and leaves the azotic gas pure.\r\n\r\nIf it is known to contain hydrogen gas, a determinate quantity is\r\nintroduced into Volta's eudiometer alongst with a known proportion of\r\nhydrogen gas; these are deflagrated together by means of the electrical\r\nspark; fresh portions of oxygen gas are successively added, till no\r\nfarther deflagration takes place, and till the greatest possible\r\ndiminution is produced. By this process water is formed, which is\r\nimmediately absorbed by the water of the apparatus; but, if the hydrogen\r\ngas contain charcoal, carbonic acid is formed at the same time, which is\r\nnot absorbed so quickly; the quantity of this is readily ascertained by\r\nassisting its absorption, by means of agitation. If the residuum\r\ncontains nitrous gas, by adding oxygen gas, with which it combines into\r\nnitric acid, we can very nearly ascertain its quantity, from the\r\ndiminution produced by this mixture.\r\n\r\nI confine myself to these general examples, which are sufficient to give\r\nan idea of this kind of operations; a whole volume would not serve to\r\nexplain every possible case. It is necessary to become familiar with the\r\nanalysis of gasses by long experience; we must even acknowledge that\r\nthey mostly possess such powerful affinities to each other, that we are\r\nnot always certain of having separated them completely. In these cases,\r\nwe must vary our experiments in every possible point of view, add new\r\nagents to the combination, and keep out others, and continue our trials,\r\ntill we are certain of the truth and exactitude of our conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.\r\n\r\n_Of the necessary corrections upon the volume of the Gasses, according\r\nto the pressure of the Atmosphere._\r\n\r\nAll elastic fluids are compressible or condensible in proportion to the\r\nweight with which they are loaded. Perhaps this law, which is\r\nascertained by general experience, may suffer some irregularity when\r\nthese fluids are under a degree of condensation almost sufficient to\r\nreduce them to the liquid state, or when either in a state of extreme\r\nrarefaction or condensation; but we seldom approach either of these\r\nlimits with most of the gasses which we submit to our experiments. I\r\nunderstand this proposition of gasses being compressible, in proportion\r\nto their superincumbent weights, as follows:\r\n\r\nA barometer, which is an instrument generally known, is, properly\r\nspeaking, a species of syphon, ABCD, Pl. XII. Fig. 16. whose leg AB is\r\nfilled with mercury, whilst the leg CD is full of air. If we suppose the\r\nbranch CD indefinitely continued till it equals the height of our\r\natmosphere, we can readily conceive that the barometer is, in reality, a\r\nsort of balance, in which a column of mercury stands in equilibrium\r\nwith a column of air of the same weight. But it is unnecessary to\r\nprolongate the branch CD to such a height, as it is evident that the\r\nbarometer being immersed in air, the column of mercury AB will be\r\nequally in equilibrium with a column of air of the same diameter, though\r\nthe leg CD be cut off at C, and the part CD be taken away altogether.\r\n\r\nThe medium height of mercury in equilibrium with the weight of a column\r\nof air, from the highest part of the atmosphere to the surface of the\r\nearth is about twenty-eight French inches in the lower parts of the city\r\nof Paris; or, in other words, the air at the surface of the earth at\r\nParis is usually pressed upon by a weight equal to that of a column of\r\nmercury twenty-eight inches in height. I must be understood in this way\r\nin the several parts of this publication when talking of the different\r\ngasses, as, for instance, when the cubical foot of oxygen gas is said to\r\nweigh 1 oz. 4 gros, under 28 inches pressure. The height of this\r\ncolumn of mercury, supported by the pressure of the air, diminishes in\r\nproportion as we are elevated above the surface of the earth, or rather\r\nabove the level of the sea, because the mercury can only form an\r\nequilibrium with the column of air which is above it, and is not in the\r\nsmallest degree affected by the air which is below its level.\r\n\r\nIn what ratio does the mercury in the barometer descend in proportion to\r\nits elevation? or, what is the same thing, according to what law or\r\nratio do the several strata of the atmosphere decrease in density? This\r\nquestion, which has exercised the ingenuity of natural philosophers\r\nduring last century, is considerably elucidated by the following\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nIf we take the glass syphon ABCDE, Pl. XII. Fig. 17. shut at E, and open\r\nat A, and introduce a few drops of mercury, so as to intercept the\r\ncommunication of air between the leg AB and the leg BE, it is evident\r\nthat the air contained in BCDE is pressed upon, in common with the whole\r\nsurrounding air, by a weight or column of air equal to 28 inches of\r\nmercury. But, if we pour 28 inches of mercury into the leg AB, it is\r\nplain the air in the branch BCDE will now be pressed upon by a weight\r\nequal to twice 28 inches of mercury, or twice the weight of the\r\natmosphere; and experience shows, that, in this case, the included air,\r\ninstead of filling the tube from B to E, only occupies from C to E, or\r\nexactly one half of the space it filled before. If to this first column\r\nof mercury we add two other portions of 28 inches each, in the branch\r\nAB, the air in the branch BCDE will be pressed upon by four times the\r\nweight of the atmosphere, or four times the weight of 28 inches of\r\nmercury, and it will then only fill the space from D to E, or exactly\r\none quarter of the space it occupied at the commencement of the\r\nexperiment. From these experiments, which may be infinitely varied, has\r\nbeen deduced as a general law of nature, which seems applicable to all\r\npermanently elastic fluids, that they diminish in volume in proportion\r\nto the weights with which they are pressed upon; or, in other words,\r\n\"_the volume of all elastic fluids is in the inverse ratio of the weight\r\nby which they are compressed_.\"\r\n\r\nThe experiments which have been made for measuring the heights of\r\nmountains by means of the barometer, confirm the truth of these\r\ndeductions; and, even supposing them in some degree inaccurate, these\r\ndifferences are so extremely small, that they may be reckoned as\r\nnullities in chemical experiments. When this law of the compression of\r\nelastic fluids is once well understood, it becomes easily applicable to\r\nthe corrections necessary in pneumato chemical experiments upon the\r\nvolume of gas, in relation to its pressure. These corrections are of two\r\nkinds, the one relative to the variations of the barometer, and the\r\nother for the column of water or mercury contained in the jars. I shall\r\nendeavour to explain these by examples, beginning with the most simple\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSuppose that 100 cubical inches of oxygen gas are obtained at 10°\r\n(54.5°) of the thermometer, and at 28 inches 6 lines of the barometer,\r\nit is required to know what volume the 100 cubical inches of gas would\r\noccupy, under the pressure of 28 inches[58], and what is the exact\r\nweight of the 100 inches of oxygen gas? Let the unknown volume, or the\r\nnumber of inches this gas would occupy at 28 inches of the barometer, be\r\nexpressed by x; and, since the volumes are in the inverse ratio of\r\ntheir superincumbent weights, we have the following statement: 100\r\ncubical inches is to x inversely as 28.5 inches of pressure is to 28.0\r\ninches; or directly 28 : 28.5 :: 100 : x = 101.786--cubical inches, at\r\n28 inches barometrical pressure; that is to say, the same gas or air\r\nwhich at 28.5 inches of the barometer occupies 100 cubical inches of\r\nvolume, will occupy 101.786 cubical inches when the barometer is at 28\r\ninches. It is equally easy to calculate the weight of this gas,\r\noccupying 100 cubical inches, under 28.5 inches of barometrical\r\npressure; for, as it corresponds to 101.786 cubical inches at the\r\npressure of 28, and as, at this pressure, and at 10° (54.5°) of\r\ntemperature, each cubical inch of oxygen gas weighs half a grain, it\r\nfollows, that 100 cubical inches, under 28.5 barometrical pressure, must\r\nweigh 50.893 grains. This conclusion might have been formed more\r\ndirectly, as, since the volume of elastic fluids is in the inverse ratio\r\nof their compression, their weights must be in the direct ratio of the\r\nsame compression: Hence, since 100 cubical inches weigh 50 grains, under\r\nthe pressure of 28 inches, we have the following statement to determine\r\nthe weight of 100 cubical inches of the same gas as 28.5 barometrical\r\npressure, 28 : 50 :: 28.5 : x, the unknown quantity, = 50.893.\r\n\r\nThe following case is more complicated: Suppose the jar A, Pl. XII. Fig.\r\n18. to contain a quantity of gas in its upper part ACD, the rest of the\r\njar below CD being full of mercury, and the whole standing in the\r\nmercurial bason or reservoir GHIK, filled with mercury up to EF, and\r\nthat the difference between the surface CD of the mercury in the jar,\r\nand EF, that in the cistern, is six inches, while the barometer stands\r\nat 27.5 inches. It is evident from these data, that the air contained in\r\nACD is pressed upon by the weight of the atmosphere, diminished by the\r\nweight of the column of mercury CE, or by 27.5 - 6 = 21.5 inches of\r\nbarometrical pressure. This air is therefore less compressed than the\r\natmosphere at the mean height of the barometer, and consequently\r\noccupies more space than it would occupy at the mean pressure, the\r\ndifference being exactly proportional to the difference between the\r\ncompressing weights. If, then, upon measuring the space ACD, it is found\r\nto be 120 cubical inches, it must be reduced to the volume which it\r\nwould occupy under the mean pressure of 28 inches. This is done by the\r\nfollowing statement: 120 : x, the unknown volume, :: 21.5 : 28\r\ninversely; this gives x = 120 × 21.5 / 28 = 92.143 cubical inches.\r\n\r\nIn these calculations we may either reduce the height of the mercury in\r\nthe barometer, and the difference of level in the jar and bason, into\r\nlines or decimal fractions of the inch; but I prefer the latter, as it\r\nis more readily calculated. As, in these operations, which frequently\r\nrecur, it is of great use to have means of abbreviation, I have given a\r\ntable in the appendix for reducing lines and fractions of lines into\r\ndecimal fractions of the inch.\r\n\r\nIn experiments performed in the water-apparatus, we must make similar\r\ncorrections to procure rigorously exact results, by taking into account,\r\nand making allowances for the difference of height of the water within\r\nthe jar above the surface of the water in the cistern. But, as the\r\npressure of the atmosphere is expressed in inches and lines of the\r\nmercurial barometer, and, as homogeneous quantities only can be\r\ncalculated together, we must reduce the observed inches and lines of\r\nwater into correspondent heights of the mercury. I have given a table in\r\nthe appendix for this conversion, upon the supposition that mercury is\r\n13.5681 times heavier than water.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Corrections relative to the Degrees of the Thermometer._\r\n\r\nIn ascertaining the weight of gasses, besides reducing them to a mean of\r\nbarometrical pressure, as directed in the preceding section, we must\r\nlikewise reduce them to a standard thermometrical temperature; because,\r\nall elastic fluids being expanded by heat, and condensed by cold, their\r\nweight in any determinate volume is thereby liable to considerable\r\nalterations. As the temperature of 10° (54.5°) is a medium between the\r\nheat of summer and the cold of winter, being the temperature of\r\nsubterraneous places, and that which is most easily approached to at all\r\nseasons, I have chosen that degree as a mean to which I reduce air or\r\ngas in this species of calculation.\r\n\r\nMr de Luc found that atmospheric air was increased 1/215 part of its\r\nbulk, by each degree of a mercurial thermometer, divided into 81\r\ndegrees, between the freezing and boiling points; this gives 1/211 part\r\nfor each degree of Reaumur's thermometer, which is divided into 80\r\ndegrees between these two points. The experiments of Mr Monge seem to\r\nmake this dilatation less for hydrogen gas, which he thinks is only\r\ndilated 1/180. We have not any exact experiments hitherto published\r\nrespecting the ratio of dilatation of the other gasses; but, from the\r\ntrials which have been made, their dilatation seems to differ little\r\nfrom that of atmospheric air. Hence I may take for granted, till farther\r\nexperiments give us better information upon this subject, that\r\natmospherical air is dilated 1/210 part, and hydrogen gas 1/190 part for\r\neach degree of the thermometer; but, as there is still great uncertainty\r\nupon this point, we ought always to operate in a temperature as near as\r\npossible to the standard of 10°, (54.5°) by this means any errors in\r\ncorrecting the weight or volume of gasses by reducing them to the common\r\nstandard, will become of little moment.\r\n\r\nThe calculation for this correction is extremely easy. Divide the\r\nobserved volume of air by 210, and multiply the quotient by the degrees\r\nof temperature above or below 10° (54.5°). This correction is negative\r\nwhen the actual temperature is above the standard, and positive when\r\nbelow. By the use of logarithmical tables this calculation is much\r\nfacilitated[59].\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VII.\r\n\r\n_Example for calculating the Corrections relative to the Variations of\r\nPressure and Temperature._\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE.\r\n\r\nIn the jar A, Pl. IV. Fig. 3. standing in a water apparatus, is\r\ncontained 353 cubical inches of air; the surface of the water within the\r\njar at EF is 4-1/2 inches above the water in the cistern, the barometer\r\nis at 27 inches 9-1/2 lines, and the thermometer at 15° (65.75°). Having\r\nburnt a quantity of phosphorus in the air, by which concrete phosphoric\r\nacid is produced, the air after the combustion occupies 295 cubical\r\ninches, the water within the jar stands 7 inches above that in the\r\ncistern, the barometer is at 27 inches 9-1/4 lines, and the thermometer\r\nat 16° (68°). It is required from these data to determine the actual\r\nvolume of air before and after combustion, and the quantity absorbed\r\nduring the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calculation before Combustion._\r\n\r\nThe air in the jar before combustion was 353 cubical inches, but it was\r\nonly under a barometrical pressure of 27 inches 9-1/2 lines; which,\r\nreduced to decimal fractions by Tab. I. of the Appendix, gives 27.79167\r\ninches; and from this we must deduct the difference of 4-1/2 inches of\r\nwater, which, by Tab. II. corresponds to 0.33166 inches of the\r\nbarometer; hence the real pressure of the air in the jar is 27.46001. As\r\nthe volume of elastic fluids diminish in the inverse ratio of the\r\ncompressing weights, we have the following statement to reduce the 353\r\ninches to the volume the air would occupy at 28 inches barometrical\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n353 : x, the unknown volume, :: 27.46001 : 28. Hence, x = 353 ×\r\n27.46001 / 28 = 346.192 cubical inches, which is the volume the same\r\nquantity of air would have occupied at 28 inches of the barometer.\r\n\r\nThe 210th part of this corrected volume is 1.65, which, for the five\r\ndegrees of temperature above the standard gives 8.255 cubical inches;\r\nand, as this correction is subtractive, the real corrected volume of the\r\nair before combustion is 337.942 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calculation after Combustion._\r\n\r\nBy a similar calculation upon the volume of air after combustion, we\r\nfind its barometrical pressure 27.77083 - 0.51593 = 27.25490. Hence, to\r\nhave the volume of air under the pressure of 28 inches, 295 : x ::\r\n27.77083 : 28 inversely; or, x = 295 x 27.25490 / 28 = 287.150. The\r\n210th part of this corrected volume is 1.368, which, multiplied by 6\r\ndegrees of thermometrical difference, gives the subtractive correction\r\nfor temperature 8.208, leaving the actual corrected volume of air after\r\ncombustion 278.942 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Result._\r\n\r\nThe corrected volume before combustion          337.942\r\n\r\nDitto remaining after combustion                278.942\r\n                                               --------\r\nVolume absorbed during combustion                59.000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII.\r\n\r\n_Method of determining the Absolute Gravity of the different Gasses._\r\n\r\nTake a large balloon A, Pl. V. Fig. 10. capable of holding 17 or 18\r\npints, or about half a cubical foot, having the brass cap bcde\r\nstrongly cemented to its neck, and to which the tube and stop-cock f g\r\nis fixed by a tight screw. This apparatus is connected by the double\r\nscrew represented separately at Fig. 12. to the jar BCD, Fig. 10. which\r\nmust be some pints larger in dimensions than the balloon. This jar is\r\nopen at top, and is furnished with the brass cap h i, and stop-cock l\r\nm. One of these slop-cocks is represented separately at Fig. 11.\r\n\r\nWe first determine the exact capacity of the balloon by filling it with\r\nwater, and weighing it both full and empty. When emptied of water, it is\r\ndried with a cloth introduced through its neck d e, and the last\r\nremains of moisture are removed by exhausting it once or twice in an\r\nair-pump.\r\n\r\nWhen the weight of any gas is to be ascertained, this apparatus is used\r\nas follows: Fix the balloon A to the plate of an air-pump by means of\r\nthe screw of the stop-cock f g, which is left open; the balloon is to\r\nbe exhausted as completely as possible, observing carefully the degree\r\nof exhaustion by means of the barometer attached to the air-pump. When\r\nthe vacuum is formed, the stop-cock f g is shut, and the weight of the\r\nballoon determined with the most scrupulous exactitude. It is then fixed\r\nto the jar BCD, which we suppose placed in water in the shelf of the\r\npneumato chemical apparatus Fig. 1.; the jar is to be filled with the\r\ngas we mean to weigh, and then, by opening the stop-cocks f g and l\r\nm, the gas ascends into the balloon, whilst the water of the cistern\r\nrises at the same time into the jar. To avoid very troublesome\r\ncorrections, it is necessary, during this first part of the operation,\r\nto sink the jar in the cistern till the surfaces of the water within the\r\njar and without exactly correspond. The stop-cocks are again shut, and\r\nthe balloon being unscrewed from its connection with the jar, is to be\r\ncarefully weighed; the difference between this weight and that of the\r\nexhausted balloon is the precise weight of the air or gas contained in\r\nthe balloon. Multiply this weight by 1728, the number of cubical inches\r\nin a cubical foot, and divide the product by the number of cubical\r\ninches contained in the balloon, the quotient is the weight of a cubical\r\nfoot of the gas or air submitted to experiment.\r\n\r\nExact account must be kept of the barometrical height and temperature of\r\nthe thermometer during the above experiment; and from these the\r\nresulting weight of a cubical foot is easily corrected to the standard\r\nof 28 inches and 10°, as directed in the preceding section. The small\r\nportion of air remaining in the balloon after forming the vacuum must\r\nlikewise be attended to, which is easily determined by the barometer\r\nattached to the air-pump. If that barometer, for instance, remains at\r\nthe hundredth part of the height it stood at before the vacuum was\r\nformed, we conclude that one hundredth part of the air originally\r\ncontained remained in the balloon, and consequently that only 99/100 of\r\ngas was introduced from the jar into the balloon.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] According to the proportion of 114 to 107, given between the French\r\nand English foot, 28 inches of the French barometer are equal to 29.83\r\ninches of the English. Directions will be found in the appendix for\r\nconverting all the French weights and measures used in this work into\r\ncorresponding English denominations.--E.\r\n\r\n[59] When Fahrenheit's thermometer is employed, the dilatation by each\r\ndegree must be smaller, in the proportion of 1 to 2.25, because each\r\ndegree of Reaumur's scale contains 2.25 degrees of Fahrenheit; hence we\r\nmust divide by 472.5, and finish the rest of the calculation as\r\nabove.--E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Description of the Calorimeter, or Apparatus for measuring Caloric._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe calorimeter, or apparatus for measuring the relative quantities of\r\nheat contained in bodies, was described by Mr de la Place and me in the\r\nMemoirs of the Academy for 1780, p. 355. and from that Essay the\r\nmaterials of this chapter are extracted.\r\n\r\nIf, after having cooled any body to the freezing point, it be exposed in\r\nan atmosphere of 25° (88.25°), the body will gradually become heated,\r\nfrom the surface inwards, till at last it acquire the same temperature\r\nwith the surrounding air. But, if a piece of ice be placed in the same\r\nsituation, the circumstances are quite different; it does not approach\r\nin the smallest degree towards the temperature of the circumambient air,\r\nbut remains constantly at Zero (32°), or the temperature of melting ice,\r\ntill the last portion of ice be completely melted.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is readily explained; as, to melt ice, or reduce it to\r\nwater, it requires to be combined with a certain portion of caloric;\r\nthe whole caloric attracted from the surrounding bodies, is arrested or\r\nfixed at the surface or external layer of ice which it is employed to\r\ndissolve, and combines with it to form water; the next quantity of\r\ncaloric combines with the second layer to dissolve it into water, and so\r\non successively till the whole ice be dissolved or converted into water\r\nby combination with caloric, the very last atom still remaining at its\r\nformer temperature, because the caloric has never penetrated so far as\r\nlong as any intermediate ice remained to melt.\r\n\r\nUpon these principles, if we conceive a hollow sphere of ice at the\r\ntemperature of Zero (32°) placed in an atmosphere 10° (54.5°), and\r\ncontaining a substance at any degree of temperature above freezing, it\r\nfollows, 1st, That the heat of the external atmosphere cannot penetrate\r\ninto the internal hollow of the sphere of ice; 2dly, That the heat of\r\nthe body placed in the hollow of the sphere cannot penetrate outwards\r\nbeyond it, but will be stopped at the internal surface, and continually\r\nemployed to melt successive layers of ice, until the temperature of the\r\nbody be reduced to Zero (32°), by having all its superabundant caloric\r\nabove that temperature carried off by the ice. If the whole water,\r\nformed within the sphere of ice during the reduction of the temperature\r\nof the included body to Zero, be carefully collected, the weight of the\r\nwater will be exactly proportional to the quantity of caloric lost by\r\nthe body in passing from its original temperature to that of melting\r\nice; for it is evident that a double quantity of caloric would have\r\nmelted twice the quantity of ice; hence the quantity of ice melted is a\r\nvery exact measure of the quantity of caloric employed to produce that\r\neffect, and consequently of the quantity lost by the only substance that\r\ncould possibly have supplied it.\r\n\r\nI have made this supposition of what would take place in a hollow sphere\r\nof ice, for the purpose of more readily explaining the method used in\r\nthis species of experiment, which was first conceived by Mr de la Place.\r\nIt would be difficult to procure such spheres of ices and inconvenient\r\nto make use of them when got; but, by means of the following apparatus,\r\nwe have remedied that defect. I acknowledge the name of Calorimeter,\r\nwhich I have given it, as derived partly from Greek and partly from\r\nLatin, is in some degree open to criticism; but, in matters of science,\r\na slight deviation from strict etymology, for the sake of giving\r\ndistinctness of idea, is excusable; and I could not derive the name\r\nentirely from Greek without approaching too near to the names of known\r\ninstruments employed for other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe calorimeter is represented in Pl. VI. It is shown in perspective at\r\nFig. 1. and its interior structure is engraved in Fig. 2. and 3.; the\r\nformer being a horizontal, and the latter a perpendicular section. Its\r\ncapacity or cavity is divided into three parts, which, for better\r\ndistinction, I shall name the interior, middle, and external cavities.\r\nThe interior cavity f f f f, Fig. 4. into which the substances\r\nsubmitted to experiment are put, is composed of a grating or cage of\r\niron wire, supported by several iron bars; its opening or mouth LM, is\r\ncovered by the lid HG, of the same materials. The middle cavity b b b\r\nb, Fig. 2. and 3. is intended to contain the ice which surrounds the\r\ninterior cavity, and which is to be melted by the caloric of the\r\nsubstance employed in the experiment. The ice is supported by the grate\r\nm m at the bottom of the cavity, under which is placed the sieve n\r\nn. These two are represented separately in Fig. 5. and 6.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the ice contained in the middle cavity is melted, by\r\nthe caloric disengaged from the body placed in the interior cavity, the\r\nwater runs through the grate and sieve, and falls through the conical\r\nfunnel c c d, Fig. 3. and tube x y, into the receiver F, Fig. 1.\r\nThis water may be retained or let out at pleasure, by means of the\r\nstop-cock u. The external cavity a a a a, Fig. 2. and 3. is filled\r\nwith ice, to prevent any effect upon the ice in the middle cavity from\r\nthe heat of the surrounding air, and the water produced from it is\r\ncarried off through the pipe ST, which shuts by means of the stop-cock\r\nr. The whole machine is covered by the lid FF, Fig. 7. made of tin\r\npainted with oil colour, to prevent rust.\r\n\r\nWhen this machine is to be employed, the middle cavity b b b b, Fig.\r\n2. and 3., the lid GH, Fig. 4. of the interior cavity, the external\r\ncavity a a a a, Fig. 2. and 3. and the general lid FF, Fig. 7. are all\r\nfilled with pounded ice, well rammed, so that no void spaces remain, and\r\nthe ice of the middle cavity is allowed to drain. The machine is then\r\nopened, and the substance submitted to experiment being placed in the\r\ninterior cavity, it is instantly closed. After waiting till the included\r\nbody is completely cooled to the freezing point, and the whole melted\r\nice has drained from the middle cavity, the water collected in the\r\nvessel F, Fig. 1. is accurately weighed. The weight of the water\r\nproduced during the experiment is an exact measure of the caloric\r\ndisengaged during the cooling of the included body, as this substance is\r\nevidently in a similar situation with the one formerly mentioned as\r\nincluded in a hollow sphere of ice; the whole caloric disengaged is\r\nstopped by the ice in the middle cavity, and that ice is preserved from\r\nbeing affected by any other heat by means of the ice contained in the\r\ngeneral lid, Fig. 7. and in the external cavity. Experiments of this\r\nkind last from fifteen to twenty hours; they are sometimes accelerated\r\nby covering up the substance in the interior cavity with well drained\r\nice, which hastens its cooling.\r\n\r\nThe substances to be operated upon are placed in the thin iron bucket,\r\nFig. 8. the cover of which has an opening fitted with a cork, into which\r\na small thermometer is fixed. When we use acids, or other fluids capable\r\nof injuring the metal of the instruments, they are contained in the\r\nmatras, Fig. 10. which has a similar thermometer in a cork fitted to its\r\nmouth, and which stands in the interior cavity upon the small\r\ncylindrical support RS, Fig. 10.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely requisite that there be no communication between the\r\nexternal and middle cavities of the calorimeter, otherwise the ice\r\nmelted by the influence of the surrounding air, in the external cavity,\r\nwould mix with the water produced from the ice of the middle cavity,\r\nwhich would no longer be a measure of the caloric lost by the substance\r\nsubmitted to experiment.\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature of the atmosphere is only a few degrees above the\r\nfreezing point, its heat can hardly reach the middle cavity, being\r\narrested by the ice of the cover, Fig. 7. and of the external cavity;\r\nbut, if the temperature of the air be under the degree of freezing, it\r\nmight cool the ice contained in the middle cavity, by causing the ice\r\nin the external cavity to fall, in the first place, below zero (32°). It\r\nis therefore essential that this experiment be carried on in a\r\ntemperature somewhat above freezing: Hence, in time of frost, the\r\ncalorimeter must be kept in an apartment carefully heated. It is\r\nlikewise necessary that the ice employed be not under zero (32°); for\r\nwhich purpose it must be pounded, and spread out thin for some time, in\r\na place of a higher temperature.\r\n\r\nThe ice of the interior cavity always retains a certain quantity of\r\nwater adhering to its surface, which may be supposed to belong to the\r\nresult of the experiment; but as, at the beginning of each experiment,\r\nthe ice is already saturated with as much water as it can contain, if\r\nany of the water produced by the caloric should remain attached to the\r\nice, it is evident, that very nearly an equal quantity of what adhered\r\nto it before the experiment must have run down into the vessel F in its\r\nstead; for the inner surface of the ice in the middle cavity is very\r\nlittle changed during the experiment.\r\n\r\nBy any contrivance that could be devised, we could not prevent the\r\naccess of the external air into the interior cavity when the atmosphere\r\nwas 9° or 10° (52° or 54°) above zero. The air confined in the cavity\r\nbeing in that case specifically heavier than the external air, escapes\r\ndownwards through the pipe x y, Fig. 3, and is replaced by the warmer\r\nexternal air, which, giving out its caloric to the ice, becomes heavier,\r\nand sinks in its turn; thus a current of air is formed through the\r\nmachine, which is the more rapid in proportion as the external air\r\nexceeds the internal in temperature. This current of warm air must melt\r\na part of the ice, and injure the accuracy of the experiment: We may, in\r\na great degree, guard against this source of error by keeping the\r\nstop-cock u continually shut; but it is better to operate only when\r\nthe temperature of the external air does not exceed 3°, or at most 4°,\r\n(39° to 41°); for we have observed, that, in this case, the melting of\r\nthe interior ice by the atmospheric air is perfectly insensible; so that\r\nwe may answer for the accuracy of our experiments upon the specific heat\r\nof bodies to a fortieth part.\r\n\r\nWe have caused make two of the above described machines; one, which is\r\nintended for such experiments as do not require the interior air to be\r\nrenewed, is precisely formed according to the description here given;\r\nthe other, which answers for experiments upon combustion, respiration,\r\n&c. in which fresh quantities of air are indispensibly necessary,\r\ndiffers from the former in having two small tubes in the two lids, by\r\nwhich a current of atmospheric air may be blown into the interior cavity\r\nof the machine.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely easy, with this apparatus, to determine the phenomena\r\nwhich occur in operations where caloric is either disengaged or\r\nabsorbed. If we wish, for instance, to ascertain the quantity of caloric\r\nwhich is disengaged from a solid body in cooling a certain number of\r\ndegrees, let its temperature be raised to 80° (212°); it is then placed\r\nin the interior cavity f f f f, Fig. 2. and 3. of the calorimeter, and\r\nallowed to remain till we are certain that its temperature is reduced to\r\nzero (32°); the water produced by melting the ice during its cooling is\r\ncollected, and carefully weighed; and this weight, divided by the volume\r\nof the body submitted to experiment, multiplied into the degrees of\r\ntemperature which it had above zero at the commencement of the\r\nexperiment, gives the proportion of what the English philosophers call\r\nspecific heat.\r\n\r\nFluids are contained in proper vessels, whose specific heat has been\r\npreviously ascertained, and operated upon in the machine in the same\r\nmanner as directed for solids, taking care to deduct, from the quantity\r\nof water melted during the experiment, the proportion which belongs to\r\nthe containing vessel.\r\n\r\nIf the quantity of caloric disengaged during the combination of\r\ndifferent substances is to be determined, these substances are to be\r\npreviously reduced to the freezing degree by keeping them a sufficient\r\ntime surrounded with pounded ice; the mixture is then to be made in the\r\ninner cavity of the calorimeter, in a proper vessel likewise reduced to\r\nzero (32°); and they are kept inclosed till the temperature of the\r\ncombination has returned to the same degree: The quantity of water\r\nproduced is a measure of the caloric disengaged during the combination.\r\n\r\nTo determine the quantity of caloric disengaged during combustion, and\r\nduring animal respiration, the combustible bodies are burnt, or the\r\nanimals are made to breathe in the interior cavity, and the water\r\nproduced is carefully collected. Guinea pigs, which resist the effects\r\nof cold extremely well, are well adapted for this experiment. As the\r\ncontinual renewal of air is absolutely necessary in such experiments, we\r\nblow fresh air into the interior cavity of the calorimeter by means of a\r\npipe destined for that purpose, and allow it to escape through another\r\npipe of the same kind; and that the heat of this air may not produce\r\nerrors in the results of the experiments, the tube which conveys it into\r\nthe machine is made to pass through pounded ice, that it may be reduced\r\nto zero (32°) before it arrives at the calorimeter. The air which\r\nescapes must likewise be made to pass through a tube surrounded with\r\nice, included in the interior cavity of the machine, and the water which\r\nis produced must make a part of what is collected, because the caloric\r\ndisengaged from this air is part of the product of the experiment.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat more difficult to determine the specific caloric\r\ncontained in the different gasses, on account of their small degree of\r\ndensity; for, if they are only placed in the calorimeter in vessels like\r\nother fluids, the quantity of ice melted is so small, that the result of\r\nthe experiment becomes at best very uncertain. For this species of\r\nexperiment we have contrived to make the air pass through two metallic\r\nworms, or spiral tubes; one of these, through which the air passes, and\r\nbecomes heated in its way to the calorimeter, is contained in a vessel\r\nfull of boiling water, and the other, through which the air circulates\r\nwithin the calorimeter to disengage its caloric, is placed in the\r\ninterior cavity, f f f f, of that machine. By means of a small\r\nthermometer placed at one end of the second worm, the temperature of the\r\nair, as it enters the calorimeter, is determined, and its temperature in\r\ngetting out of the interior cavity is found by another thermometer\r\nplaced at the other end of the worm. By this contrivance we are enabled\r\nto ascertain the quantity of ice melted by determinate quantities of air\r\nor gas, while losing a certain number of degrees of temperature, and,\r\nconsequently, to determine their several degrees of specific caloric.\r\nThe same apparatus, with some particular precautions, may be employed\r\nto ascertain the quantity of caloric disengaged by the condensation of\r\nthe vapours of different liquids.\r\n\r\nThe various experiments which may be made with the calorimeter do not\r\nafford absolute conclusions, but only give us the measure of relative\r\nquantities; we have therefore to fix a unit, or standard point, from\r\nwhence to form a scale of the several results. The quantity of caloric\r\nnecessary to melt a pound of ice has been chosen as this unit; and, as\r\nit requires a pound of water of the temperature of 60° (167°) to melt a\r\npound of ice, the quantity of caloric expressed by our unit or standard\r\npoint is what raises a pound of water from zero (32°) to 60° (167°).\r\nWhen this unit is once determined, we have only to express the\r\nquantities of caloric disengaged from different bodies by cooling a\r\ncertain number of degrees, in analogous values: The following is an easy\r\nmode of calculation for this purpose, applied to one of our earliest\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nWe took 7 lib. 11 oz. 2 gros 36 grs. of plate-iron, cut into\r\nnarrow slips, and rolled up, or expressing the quantity in decimals,\r\n7.7070319. These, being heated in a bath of boiling water to about 78°\r\n(207.5°), were quickly introduced into the interior cavity of the\r\ncalorimeter: At the end of eleven hours, when the whole quantity of\r\nwater melted from the ice had thoroughly drained off, we found that\r\n1.109795 pounds of ice were melted. Hence, the caloric disengaged from\r\nthe iron by cooling 78° (175.5°) having melted 1.109795 pounds of ice,\r\nhow much would have been melted by cooling 60° (135°)? This question\r\ngives the following statement in direct proportion, 78 : 1.109795 :: 60\r\n: x = 0.85369. Dividing this quantity by the weight of the whole iron\r\nemployed, viz. 7.7070319, the quotient 0.110770 is the quantity of ice\r\nwhich would have been melted by one pound of iron whilst cooling through\r\n60° (135°) of temperature.\r\n\r\nFluid substances, such as sulphuric and nitric acids, &c. are contained\r\nin a matras, Pl. VI. Fig. 9. having a thermometer adapted to the cork,\r\nwith its bulb immersed in the liquid. The matras is placed in a bath of\r\nboiling water, and when, from the thermometer, we judge the liquid is\r\nraised to a proper temperature, the matras is placed in the calorimeter.\r\nThe calculation of the products, to determine the specific caloric of\r\nthese fluids, is made as above directed, taking care to deduct from the\r\nwater obtained the quantity which would have been produced by the matras\r\nalone, which must be ascertained by a previous experiment. The table of\r\nthe results obtained by these experiments is omitted, because not yet\r\nsufficiently complete, different circumstances having occasioned the\r\nseries to be interrupted; it is not, however, lost sight of; and we are\r\nless or more employed upon the subject every winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n_Of Mechanical Operations for Division of Bodies._\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n_Of Trituration, Levigation, and Pulverization._\r\n\r\nThese are, properly speaking, only preliminary mechanical operations for\r\ndividing and separating the particles of bodies, and reducing them into\r\nvery fine powder. These operations can never reduce substances into\r\ntheir primary, or elementary and ultimate particles; they do not even\r\ndestroy the aggregation of bodies; for every particle, after the most\r\naccurate trituration, forms a small whole, resembling the original mass\r\nfrom which it was divided. The real chemical operations, on the\r\ncontrary, such as solution, destroy the aggregation of bodies, and\r\nseparate their constituent and integrant particles from each other.\r\n\r\nBrittle substances are reduced to powder by means of pestles and\r\nmortars. These are of brass or iron, Pl. I. Fig. 1.; of marble or\r\ngranite, Fig. 2.; of lignum vitae, Fig. 3.; of glass, Fig. 4.; of agate,\r\nFig. 5.; or of porcellain, Fig. 6. The pestles for each of these are\r\nrepresented in the plate, immediately below the mortars to which they\r\nrespectively belong, and are made of hammered iron or brass, of wood,\r\nglass, porcellain, marble, granite, or agate, according to the nature of\r\nthe substances they are intended to triturate. In every laboratory, it\r\nis requisite to have an assortment of these utensils, of various sizes\r\nand kinds: Those of porcellain and glass can only be used for rubbing\r\nsubstances to powder, by a dexterous use of the pestle round the sides\r\nof the mortar, as it would be easily broken by reiterated blows of the\r\npestle.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of mortars ought to be in the form of a hollow sphere, and\r\ntheir sides should have such a degree of inclination as to make the\r\nsubstances they contain fall back to the bottom when the pestle is\r\nlifted, but not so perpendicular as to collect them too much together,\r\notherwise too large a quantity would get below the pestle, and prevent\r\nits operation. For this reason, likewise, too large a quantity of the\r\nsubstance to be powdered ought not to be put into the mortar at one\r\ntime; and we must from time to time get rid of the particles already\r\nreduced to powder, by means of sieves to be afterwards described.\r\n\r\nThe most usual method of levigation is by means of a flat table ABCD,\r\nPl. 1. Fig. 7. of porphyry, or other stone of similar hardness, upon\r\nwhich the substance to be reduced to powder is spread, and is then\r\nbruised and rubbed by a muller M, of the same hard materials, the bottom\r\nof which is made a small portion of a large sphere; and, as the muller\r\ntends continually to drive the substances towards the sides of the\r\ntable, a thin flexible knife, or spatula of iron, horn, wood, or ivory,\r\nis used for bringing them back to the middle of the stone.\r\n\r\nIn large works, this operation is performed by means of large rollers of\r\nhard stone, which turn upon each other, either horizontally, in the way\r\nof corn-mills, or by one vertical roller turning upon a flat stone. In\r\nthe above operations, it is often requisite to moisten the substances a\r\nlittle, to prevent the fine powder from flying off.\r\n\r\nThere are many bodies which cannot be reduced to powder by any of the\r\nforegoing methods; such are fibrous substances, as woods; such as are\r\ntough and elastic, as the horns of animals, elastic gum, &c. and the\r\nmalleable metals which flatten under the pestle, instead of being\r\nreduced to powder. For reducing the woods to powder, rasps, as Pl. I.\r\nFig. 8. are employed; files of a finer kind are used for horn, and still\r\nfiner, Pl. 1. Fig. 9. and 10. for metals.\r\n\r\nSome of the metals, though not brittle enough to powder under the\r\npestle, are too soft to be filed, as they clog the file, and prevent its\r\noperation. Zinc is one of these, but it may be powdered when hot in a\r\nheated iron mortar, or it may be rendered brittle, by alloying it with a\r\nsmall quantity of mercury. One or other of these methods is used by\r\nfire-work makers for producing a blue flame by means of zinc. Metals may\r\nbe reduced into grains, by pouring them when melted into water, which\r\nserves very well when they are not wanted in fine powder.\r\n\r\nFruits, potatoes, &c. of a pulpy and fibrous nature may be reduced to\r\npulp by means of the grater, Pl. 1. Fig. 11.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the different substances of which these instruments are\r\nmade is a matter of importance; brass or copper are unfit for operations\r\nupon substances to be used as food or in pharmacy; and marble or\r\nmetallic instruments must not be used for acid substances; hence mortars\r\nof very hard wood, and those of porcelain, granite, or glass, are of\r\ngreat utility in many operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n_Of Sifting and Washing Powdered Substances._\r\n\r\nNone of the mechanical operations employed for reducing bodies to powder\r\nis capable of producing it of an equal degree of fineness throughout;\r\nthe powder obtained by the longest and most accurate trituration being\r\nstill an assemblage of particles of various sizes. The coarser of these\r\nare removed, so as only to leave the finer and more homogeneous\r\nparticles by means of sieves, Pl. I. Fig. 12. 13. 14. 15. of different\r\nfinenesses, adapted to the particular purposes they are intended for;\r\nall the powdered matter which is larger than the intestices of the sieve\r\nremains behind, and is again submitted to the pestle, while the finer\r\npass through. The sieve Fig. 12. is made of hair-cloth, or of silk\r\ngauze; and the one represented Fig. 13. is of parchment pierced with\r\nround holes of a proper size; this latter is employed in the manufacture\r\nof gun-powder. When very subtile or valuable materials are to be sifted,\r\nwhich are easily dispersed, or when the finer parts of the powder may be\r\nhurtful, a compound sieve, Fig. 15. is made use of, which consists of\r\nthe sieve ABCD, with a lid EF, and receiver GH; these three parts are\r\nrepresented as joined together for use, Fig. 14.\r\n\r\nThere is a method of procuring powders of an uniform fineness,\r\nconsiderably more accurate than the sieve; but it can only be used with\r\nsuch substances as are not acted upon by water. The powdered substance\r\nis mixed and agitated with water, or other convenient fluid; the liquor\r\nis allowed to settle for a few moments, and is then decanted off; the\r\ncoarsest powder remains at the bottom of the vessel, and the finer\r\npasses over with the liquid. By repeated decantations in this manner,\r\nvarious sediments are obtained of different degrees of fineness; the\r\nlast sediment, or that which remains longed suspended in the liquor,\r\nbeing the finest. This process may likewise be used with advantage for\r\nseparating substances of different degrees of specific gravity, though\r\nof the same fineness; this last is chiefly employed in mining, for\r\nseparating the heavier metallic ores from the lighter earthy matters\r\nwith which they are mixed.\r\n\r\nIn chemical laboratories, pans and jugs of glass or earthen ware are\r\nemployed for this operation; sometimes, for decanting the liquor without\r\ndisturbing the sediment, the glass syphon ABCHI, Pl. II. Fig. 11. is\r\nused, which may be supported by means of the perforated board DE, at the\r\nproper depth in the vessel FG, to draw off all the liquor required into\r\nthe receiver LM. The principles and application of this useful\r\ninstrument are so well known as to need no explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\n_Of Filtration._\r\n\r\nA filtre is a species of very fine sieve, which is permeable to the\r\nparticles of fluids, but through which the particles of the finest\r\npowdered solids are incapable of passing; hence its use in separating\r\nfine powders from suspension in fluids. In pharmacy, very close and fine\r\nwoollen cloths are chiefly used for this operation; these are commonly\r\nformed in a conical shape, Pl. II. Fig. 2. which has the advantage of\r\nuniting all the liquor which drains through into a point A, where it may\r\nbe readily collected in a narrow mouthed vessel. In large pharmaceutical\r\nlaboratories, this filtring bag is streached upon a wooden stand, Pl.\r\nII. Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of chemistry, as it is requisite to have the filtres\r\nperfectly clean, unsized paper is substituted instead of cloth or\r\nflannel; through this substance, no solid body, however finely it be\r\npowdered, can penetrate, and fluids percolate through it with the\r\ngreatest readiness. As paper breaks easily when wet, various methods of\r\nsupporting it are used according to circumstances. When a large quantity\r\nof fluid is to be filtrated, the paper is supported by the frame of\r\nwood, Pl. II. Fig. 3. ABCD, having a piece of coarse cloth stretched\r\nover it, by means of iron-hooks. This cloth must be well cleaned each\r\ntime it is used, or even new cloth must be employed, if there is reason\r\nto suspect its being impregnated with any thing which can injure the\r\nsubsequent operations. In ordinary operations, where moderate quantities\r\nof fluid are to be filtrated, different kinds of glass funnels are used\r\nfor supporting the paper, as represented Pl. II. Fig. 5. 6. and 7. When\r\nseveral filtrations must be carried on at once, the board or shelf AB,\r\nFig. 9. supported upon stands C and D, and pierced with round holes, is\r\nvery convenient for containing the funnels.\r\n\r\nSome liquors are so thick and clammy, as not to be able to penetrate\r\nthrough paper without some previous preparation, such as clarification\r\nby means of white of eggs, which being mixed with the liquor, coagulates\r\nwhen brought to boil, and, entangling the greater part of the impurities\r\nof the liquor, rises with them to the surface in the state of scum.\r\nSpiritous liquors may be clarified in the same manner by means of\r\nisinglass dissolved in water, which coagulates by the action of the\r\nalkohol without the assistance of heat.\r\n\r\nAs most of the acids are produced by distillation, and are consequently\r\nclear, we have rarely any occasion to filtrate them; but if, at any\r\ntime, concentrated acids require this operation, it is impossible to\r\nemploy paper, which would be corroded and destroyed by the acid. For\r\nthis purpose, pounded glass, or rather quartz or rock-cristal, broke in\r\npieces and grossly powdered, answers very well; a few of the larger\r\npieces are put in the neck of the funnel; these are covered with the\r\nsmaller pieces, the finer powder is placed over all, and the acid is\r\npoured on at top. For the ordinary purposes of society, river-water is\r\nfrequently filtrated by means of clean washed sand, to separate its\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.\r\n\r\n_Of Decantation._\r\n\r\nThis operation is often substituted instead of filtration for separating\r\nsolid particles which are diffused through liquors. These are allowed to\r\nsettle in conical vessels, ABCDE, Pl. II. Fig. 10. the diffused matters\r\ngradually subside, and the clear fluid is gently poured off. If the\r\nsediment be extremely light, and apt to mix again with the fluid by the\r\nslightest motion, the syphon, Fig. 11. is used, instead of decantation,\r\nfor drawing off the clear fluid.\r\n\r\nIn experiments, where the weight of the precipitate must be rigorously\r\nascertained, decantation is preferable to filtration, providing the\r\nprecipitate be several times washed in a considerable proportion of\r\nwater. The weight of the precipitate may indeed be ascertained, by\r\ncarefully weighing the filtre before and after the operation; but, when\r\nthe quantity of precipitate is small, the different proportions of\r\nmoisture retained by the paper, in a greater or lesser degree of\r\nexsiccation, may prove a material source of error, which ought carefully\r\nto be guarded against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of Chemical Means for separating the Particles of Bodies from each\r\nother; without Decomposition, and for uniting them again._\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already shown that there are two methods of dividing the\r\nparticles of bodies, the _mechanical_ and _chemical_. The former only\r\nseparates a solid mass into a great number of smaller masses; and for\r\nthese purposes various species of forces are employed, according to\r\ncircumstances, such as the strength of man or of animals, the weight of\r\nwater applied through the means of hydraulic engines, the expansive\r\npower of steam, the force of the wind, &c. By all these mechanical\r\npowers, we can never reduce substances into powder beyond a certain\r\ndegree of fineness; and the smallest particle produced in this way,\r\nthough it seems very minute to our organs, is still in fact a mountain,\r\nwhen compared with the ultimate elementary particles of the pulverized\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nThe chemical agents, on the contrary, divide bodies into their primitive\r\nparticles. If, for instance, a neutral salt be acted upon by these, it\r\nis divided, as far as is possible, without ceasing to be a neutral salt.\r\nIn this Chapter, I mean to give examples of this kind of division of\r\nbodies, to which I shall add some account of the relative operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n_Of the Solution of Salts._\r\n\r\nIn chemical language, the terms of _solution_ and _dissolution_ have\r\nlong been confounded, and have very improperly been indiscriminately\r\nemployed for expressing both the division of the particles of a salt in\r\na fluid, such as water, and the division of a metal in an acid. A few\r\nreflections upon the effects of these two operations will suffice to\r\nshow that they ought not to be confounded together. In the solution of\r\nsalts, the saline particles are only separated from each other, whilst\r\nneither the salt nor the water are at all decomposed; we are able to\r\nrecover both the one and the other in the same quantity as before the\r\noperation. The same thing takes place in the solution of resins in\r\nalkohol. During metallic dissolutions, on the contrary, a decomposition,\r\neither of the acid, or of the water which dilutes it, always takes\r\nplace; the metal combines with oxygen, and is changed into an oxyd, and\r\na gasseous substance is disengaged; so that in reality none of the\r\nsubstances employed remain, after the operation, in the same state they\r\nwere in before. This article is entirely confined to the consideration\r\nof solution.\r\n\r\nTo understand properly what takes place during the solution of salts, it\r\nis necessary to know, that, in most of these operations, two distinct\r\neffects are complicated together, viz. solution by water, and solution\r\nby caloric; and, as the explanation of most of the phenomena of solution\r\ndepends upon the distinction of these two circumstances, I shall enlarge\r\na little upon their nature.\r\n\r\nNitrat of potash, usually called nitre or saltpetre, contains very\r\nlittle water of cristallization, perhaps even none at all; yet this salt\r\nliquifies in a degree of heat very little superior to that of boiling\r\nwater. This liquifaction cannot therefore be produced by means of the\r\nwater of cristallization, but in consequence of the salt being very\r\nfusible in its nature, and from its passing from the solid to the liquid\r\nstate of aggregation, when but a little raised above the temperature of\r\nboiling water. All salts are in this manner susceptible of being\r\nliquified by caloric, but in higher or lower degrees of temperature.\r\nSome of these, as the acetites of potash and soda, liquify with a very\r\nmoderate heat, whilst others, as sulphat of potash, lime, &c. require\r\nthe strongest fires we are capable of producing. This liquifaction of\r\nsalts by caloric produces exactly the same phenomena with the melting of\r\nice; it is accomplished in each salt by a determinate degree of heat,\r\nwhich remains invariably the same during the whole time of the\r\nliquifaction. Caloric is employed, and becomes fixed during the melting\r\nof the salt, and is, on the contrary, disengaged when the salt\r\ncoagulates. These are general phenomena which universally occur during\r\nthe passage of every species of substance from the solid to the fluid\r\nstate of aggregation, and from fluid to solid.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena arising from solution by caloric are always less or more\r\nconjoined with those which take place during solutions in water. We\r\ncannot pour water upon a salt, on purpose to dissolve it, without\r\nemploying a compound solvent, both water and caloric; hence we may\r\ndistinguish several different cases of solution, according to the nature\r\nand mode of existence of each salt. If, for instance, a salt be\r\ndifficultly soluble in water, and readily so by caloric, it evidently\r\nfollows, that this salt will be difficultly soluble in cold water, and\r\nconsiderably in hot water; such is nitrat of potash, and more especially\r\noxygenated muriat of potash. If another salt be little soluble both in\r\nwater and caloric, the difference of its solubility in cold and warm\r\nwater will be very inconsiderable; sulphat of lime is of this kind. From\r\nthese considerations, it follows, that there is a necessary relation\r\nbetween the following circumstances; the solubility of a salt in cold\r\nwater, its solubility in boiling water, and the degree of temperature at\r\nwhich the same salt liquifies by caloric, unassisted by water; and that\r\nthe difference of solubility in hot and cold water is so much greater in\r\nproportion to its ready solution in caloric, or in proportion to its\r\nsusceptibility of liquifying in a low degree of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe above is a general view of solution; but, for want of particular\r\nfacts, and sufficiently exact experiments, it is still nothing more than\r\nan approximation towards a particular theory. The means of compleating\r\nthis part of chemical science is extremely simple; we have only to\r\nascertain how much of each salt is dissolved by a certain quantity of\r\nwater at different degrees of temperature; and as, by the experiments\r\npublished by Mr de la Place and me, the quantity of caloric contained in\r\na pound of water at each degree of the thermometer is accurately known,\r\nit will be very easy to determine, by simple experiments, the proportion\r\nof water and caloric required for solution by each salt, what quantity\r\nof caloric is absorbed by each at the moment of liquifaction, and how\r\nmuch is disengaged at the moment of cristallization. Hence the reason\r\nwhy salts are more rapidly soluble in hot than in cold water is\r\nperfectly evident. In all solutions of salts caloric is employed; when\r\nthat is furnished intermediately from the surrounding bodies, it can\r\nonly arrive slowly to the salt; whereas this is greatly accelerated when\r\nthe requisite caloric exists ready combined with the water of solution.\r\n\r\nIn general, the specific gravity of water is augmented by holding salts\r\nin solution; but there are some exceptions to the rule. Some time hence,\r\nthe quantities of radical, of oxygen, and of base, which constitute each\r\nneutral salt, the quantity of water and caloric necessary for solution,\r\nthe increased specific gravity communicated to water, and the figure of\r\nthe elementary particles of the cristals, will all be accurately known.\r\nFrom these all the circumstances and phenomena of cristallization will\r\nbe explained, and by these means this part of chemistry will be\r\ncompleated. Mr Seguin has formed the plan of a thorough investigation of\r\nthis kind, which he is extremely capable of executing.\r\n\r\nThe solution of salts in water requires no particular apparatus; small\r\nglass phials of different sizes, Pl. II. Fig. 16. and 17. pans of\r\nearthern ware, A, Fig. 1. and 2. long-necked matrasses, Fig. 14. and\r\npans or basons of copper or of silver, Fig. 13. and 15. answer very well\r\nfor these operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n_Of Lixiviation._\r\n\r\nThis is an operation used in chemistry and manufactures for separating\r\nsubstances which are soluble in water from such as are insoluble. The\r\nlarge vat or tub, Pl. II. Fig. 12. having a hole D near its bottom,\r\ncontaining a wooden spiget and fosset or metallic stop-cock DE, is\r\ngenerally used for this purpose. A thin stratum of straw is placed at\r\nthe bottom of the tub; over this, the substance to be lixiviated is laid\r\nand covered by a cloth, then hot or cold water, according to the degree\r\nof solubility of the saline matter, is poured on. When the water is\r\nsupposed to have dissolved all the saline parts, it is let off by the\r\nstop-cock; and, as some of the water charged with salt necessarily\r\nadheres to the straw and insoluble matters, several fresh quantities of\r\nwater are poured on. The straw serves to secure a proper passage for the\r\nwater, and may be compared to the straws or glass rods used in\r\nfiltrating, to keep the paper from touching the sides of the funnel. The\r\ncloth which is laid over the matters under lixiviation prevents the\r\nwater from making a hollow in these substances where it is poured on,\r\nthrough which it might escape without acting upon the whole mass.\r\n\r\nThis operation is less or more imitated in chemical experiments; but as\r\nin these, especially with analytical views, greater exactness is\r\nrequired, particular precautions must be employed, so as not to leave\r\nany saline or soluble part in the residuum. More water must be employed\r\nthan in ordinary lixiviations, and the substances ought to be previously\r\nstirred up in the water before the clear liquor is drawn off, otherwise\r\nthe whole mass might not be equally lixiviated, and some parts might\r\neven escape altogether from the action of the water. We must likewise\r\nemploy fresh portions of water in considerable quantity, until it comes\r\noff entirely free from salt, which we may ascertain by means of the\r\nhydrometer formerly described.\r\n\r\nIn experiments with small quantities, this operation is conveniently\r\nperformed in jugs or matrasses of glass, and by filtrating the liquor\r\nthrough paper in a glass funnel. When the substance is in larger\r\nquantity, it may be lixiviated in a kettle of boiling water, and\r\nfiltrated through paper supported by cloth in the wooden frame, Pl. II.\r\nFig. 3. and 4.; and in operations in the large way, the tub already\r\nmentioned must be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\n_Of Evaporation._\r\n\r\nThis operation is used for separating two substances from each other, of\r\nwhich one at least must be fluid, and whose degrees of volatility are\r\nconsiderably different. By this means we obtain a salt, which has been\r\ndissolved in water, in its concrete form; the water, by heating, becomes\r\ncombined with caloric, which renders it volatile, while the particles of\r\nthe salt being brought nearer to each other, and within the sphere of\r\ntheir mutual attraction, unite into the solid state.\r\n\r\nAs it was long thought that the air had great influence upon the\r\nquantity of fluid evaporated, it will be proper to point out the errors\r\nwhich this opinion has produced. There certainly is a constant slow\r\nevaporation from fluids exposed to the free air; and, though this\r\nspecies of evaporation may be considered in some degree as a solution in\r\nair, yet caloric has considerable influence in producing it, as is\r\nevident from the refrigeration which always accompanies this process;\r\nhence we may consider this gradual evaporation as a compound solution\r\nmade partly in air, and partly in caloric. But the evaporation which\r\ntakes place from a fluid kept continually boiling, is quite different in\r\nits nature, and in it the evaporation produced by the action of the air\r\nis exceedingly inconsiderable in comparison with that which is\r\noccasioned by caloric. This latter species may be termed _vaporization_\r\nrather than _evaporation_. This process is not accelerated in proportion\r\nto the extent of evaporating surface, but in proportion to the\r\nquantities of caloric which combine with the fluid. Too free a current\r\nof cold air is often hurtful to this process, as it tends to carry off\r\ncaloric from the water, and consequently retards its conversion into\r\nvapour. Hence there is no inconvenience produced by covering, in a\r\ncertain degree, the vessels in which liquids are evaporated by continual\r\nboiling, provided the covering body be of such a nature as does not\r\nstrongly draw off the caloric, or, to use an expression of Dr\r\nFranklin's, provided it be a bad conductor of heat. In this case, the\r\nvapours escape through such opening as is left, and at least as much is\r\nevaporated, frequently more than when free access is allowed to the\r\nexternal air.\r\n\r\nAs during evaporation the fluid carried off by caloric is entirely lost,\r\nbeing sacrificed for the sake of the fixed substances with which it was\r\ncombined, this process is only employed where the fluid is of small\r\nvalue, as water, for instance. But, when the fluid is of more\r\nconsequence, we have recourse to distillation, in which process we\r\npreserve both the fixed substance and the volatile fluid. The vessels\r\nemployed for evaporation are basons or pans of copper, silver, or lead,\r\nPl. II. Fig. 13. and 15. or capsules of glass, porcellain, or stone\r\nware, Pl. II. A, Fig. 1. and 2. Pl. III. Fig. 3 and 4. The best utensils\r\nfor this purpose are made of the bottoms of glass retorts and matrasses,\r\nas their equal thinness renders them more fit than any other kind of\r\nglass vessel for bearing a brisk fire and sudden alterations of heat and\r\ncold without breaking.\r\n\r\nAs the method of cutting these glass vessels is no where described in\r\nbooks, I shall here give a description of it, that they may be made by\r\nchemists for themselves out of spoiled retorts, matrasses, and\r\nrecipients, at a much cheaper rate than any which can be procured from\r\nglass manufacturers. The instrument, Pl. III. Fig. 5. consisting of an\r\niron ring AC, fixed to the rod AB, having a wooden handle D, is employed\r\nas follows: Make the ring red hot in the fire, and put it upon the\r\nmatrass G, Fig. 6. which is to be cut; when the glass is sufficiently\r\nheated, throw on a little cold water, and it will generally break\r\nexactly at the circular line heated by the ring.\r\n\r\nSmall flasks or phials of thin glass are exceeding good vessels for\r\nevaporating small quantities of fluid; they are very cheap, and stand\r\nthe fire remarkably. One or more of these may be placed upon a second\r\ngrate above the furnace, Pl. III. Fig. 2. where they will only\r\nexperience a gentle heat. By this means a great number of experiments\r\nmay be carried on at one time. A glass retort, placed in a sand bath,\r\nand covered with a dome of baked earth, Pl. III. Fig. 1. answers pretty\r\nwell for evaporations; but in this way it is always considerably slower,\r\nand is even liable to accidents; as the sand heats unequally, and the\r\nglass cannot dilate in the same unequal manner, the retort is very\r\nliable to break. Sometimes the sand serves exactly the office of the\r\niron ring formerly mentioned; for, if a single drop of vapour, condensed\r\ninto liquid, happens to fall upon the heated part of the vessel, it\r\nbreaks circularly at that place. When a very intense fire is necessary,\r\nearthen crucibles may be used; but we generally use the word\r\n_evaporation_ to express what is produced by the temperature of boiling\r\nwater, or not much higher.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.\r\n\r\n_Of Cristallization._\r\n\r\nIn this process the integrant parts of a solid body, separated from each\r\nother by the intervention of a fluid, are made to exert the mutual\r\nattraction of aggregation, so as to coalesce and reproduce a solid mass.\r\nWhen the particles of a body are only separated by caloric, and the\r\nsubstance is thereby retained in the liquid state, all that is necessary\r\nfor making it cristallize, is to remove a part of the caloric which is\r\nlodged between its particles, or, in other words, to cool it. If this\r\nrefrigeration be slow, and the body be at the same time left at rest,\r\nits particles assume a regular arrangement, and cristallization,\r\nproperly so called, takes place; but, if the refrigeration is made\r\nrapidly, or if the liquor be agitated at the moment of its passage to\r\nthe concrete state, the cristallization is irregular and confused.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomena occur with watery solutions, or rather in those made\r\npartly in water, and partly by caloric. So long as there remains a\r\nsufficiency of water and caloric to keep the particles of the body\r\nasunder beyond the sphere of their mutual attraction, the salt remains\r\nin the fluid state; but, whenever either caloric or water is not present\r\nin sufficient quantity, and the attraction of the particles for each\r\nother becomes superior to the power which keeps them asunder, the salt\r\nrecovers its concrete form, and the cristals produced are the more\r\nregular in proportion as the evaporation has been slower and more\r\ntranquilly performed.\r\n\r\nAll the phenomena we formerly mentioned as taking place during the\r\nsolution of salts, occur in a contrary sense during their\r\ncristallization. Caloric is disengaged at the instant of their assuming\r\nthe solid state, which furnishes an additional proof of salt being held\r\nin solution by the compound action of water and caloric. Hence, to cause\r\nsalts to cristallize which readily liquify by means of caloric, it is\r\nnot sufficient to carry off the water which held them in solution, but\r\nthe caloric united to them must likewise be removed. Nitrat of potash,\r\noxygenated muriat of potash, alum, sulphat of soda, &c. are examples of\r\nthis circumstance, as, to make these salts cristallize, refrigeration\r\nmust be added to evaporation. Such salts, on the contrary, as require\r\nlittle caloric for being kept in solution, and which, from that\r\ncircumstance, are nearly equally soluble in cold and warm water, are\r\ncristallizable by simply carrying off the water which holds them in\r\nsolution, and even recover their solid state in boiling water; such are\r\nsulphat of lime, muriat of potash and of soda, and several others.\r\n\r\nThe art of refining saltpetre depends upon these properties of salts,\r\nand upon their different degrees of solubility in hot and cold water.\r\nThis salt, as produced in the manufactories by the first operation, is\r\ncomposed of many different salts; some are deliquescent, and not\r\nsusceptible of being cristallized, such as the nitrat and muriat of\r\nlime; others are almost equally soluble in hot and cold water, as the\r\nmuriats of potash and of soda; and, lastly, the saltpetre, or nitrat of\r\npotash, is greatly more soluble in hot than it is in cold water. The\r\noperation is begun, by pouring upon this mixture of salts as much water\r\nas will hold even the least soluble, the muriats of soda and of potash,\r\nin solution; so long as it is hot, this quantity readily dissolves all\r\nthe saltpetre, but, upon cooling, the greater part of this salt\r\ncristallizes, leaving about a sixth part remaining dissolved, and mixed\r\nwith the nitrat of lime and the two muriats. The nitre obtained by this\r\nprocess is still somewhat impregnated with other salts, because it has\r\nbeen cristallized from water in which these abound: It is completely\r\npurified from these by a second solution in a small quantity of boiling\r\nwater, and second cristallization. The water remaining after these\r\ncristallizations of nitre is still loaded with a mixture of saltpetre,\r\nand other salts; by farther evaporation, crude saltpetre, or\r\nrough-petre, as the workmen call it, is procured from it, and this is\r\npurified by two fresh solutions and cristallizations.\r\n\r\nThe deliquescent earthy salts which do not contain the nitric acid are\r\nrejected in this manufacture; but those which consist of that acid\r\nneutralized by an earthy base are dissolved in water, the earth is\r\nprecipitated by means of potash, and allowed to subside; the clear\r\nliquor is then decanted, evaporated, and allowed to cristallize. The\r\nabove management for refining saltpetre may serve as a general rule for\r\nseparating salts from each other which happen to be mixed together. The\r\nnature of each must be considered, the proportion in which each\r\ndissolves in given quantities of water, and the different solubility of\r\neach in hot and cold water. If to these we add the property which some\r\nsalts possess, of being soluble in alkohol, or in a mixture of alkohol\r\nand water, we have many resources for separating salts from each other\r\nby means of cristallization, though it must be allowed that it is\r\nextremely difficult to render this separation perfectly complete.\r\n\r\nThe vessels used for cristallization are pans of earthen ware, A, Pl.\r\nII. Fig. 1. and 2. and large flat dishes, Pl. III. Fig. 7. When a saline\r\nsolution is to be exposed to a slow evaporation in the heat of the\r\natmosphere, with free access of air, vessels of some depth, Pl. III.\r\nFig. 3. must be employed, that there may be a considerable body of\r\nliquid; by this means the cristals produced are of considerable size,\r\nand remarkably regular in their figure.\r\n\r\nEvery species of salt cristallizes in a peculiar form, and even each\r\nsalt varies in the form of its cristals according to circumstances,\r\nwhich take place during cristallization. We must not from thence\r\nconclude that the saline particles of each species are indeterminate in\r\ntheir figures: The primative particles of all bodies, especially of\r\nsalts, are perfectly constant in their specific forms; but the cristals\r\nwhich form in our experiments are composed of congeries of minute\r\nparticles, which, though perfectly equal in size and shape, may assume\r\nvery dissimilar arrangements, and consequently produce a vast variety of\r\nregular forms, which have not the smallest apparent resemblance to each\r\nother, nor to the original cristal. This subject has been very ably\r\ntreated by the Abbé Haüy, in several memoirs presented to the Academy,\r\nand in his work upon the structure of cristals: It is only necessary to\r\nextend generally to the class of salts the principles he has\r\nparticularly applied to some cristalized stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.\r\n\r\n_Of Simple Distillation._\r\n\r\nAs distillation has two distinct objects to accomplish, it is divisible\r\ninto simple and compound; and, in this section, I mean to confine myself\r\nentirely to the former. When two bodies, of which one is more volatile\r\nthan the other, or has more affinity to caloric, are submitted to\r\ndistillation, our intention is to separate them from each other: The\r\nmore volatile substance assumes the form of gas, and is afterwards\r\ncondensed by refrigeration in proper vessels. In this case distillation,\r\nlike evaporation, becomes a species of mechanical operation, which\r\nseparates two substances from each other without decomposing or altering\r\nthe nature of either. In evaporation, our only object is to preserve the\r\nfixed body, without paying any regard to the volatile matter; whereas,\r\nin distillation, our principal attention is generally paid to the\r\nvolatile substance, unless when we intend to preserve both the one and\r\nthe other. Hence, simple distillation is nothing more than evaporation\r\nproduced in close vessels.\r\n\r\nThe most simple distilling vessel is a species of bottle or matrass, A,\r\nPl. III. Fig. 8. which has been bent from its original form BC to BD,\r\nand which is then called a retort; when used, it is placed either in a\r\nreverberatory furnace, Pl. XIII. Fig. 2. or in a sand bath under a dome\r\nof baked earth, Pl. III. Fig. 1. To receive and condense the products,\r\nwe adapt a recipient, E, Pl. III. Fig. 9. which is luted to the retort.\r\nSometimes, more especially in pharmaceutical operations, the glass or\r\nstone ware cucurbit, A, with its capital B, Pl. III. Fig. 12, or the\r\nglass alembic and capital, Fig. 13. of one piece, is employed. This\r\nlatter is managed by means of a tubulated opening T, fitted with a\r\nground stopper of cristal; the capital, both of the cucurbit and\r\nalembic, has a furrow or trench, r r, intended for conveying the\r\ncondensed liquor into the beak RS, by which it runs out. As, in almost\r\nall distillations, expansive vapours are produced, which might burst the\r\nvessels employed, we are under the necessity of having a small hole, T,\r\nFig. 9. in the balloon or recipient, through which these may find vent;\r\nhence, in this way of distilling, all the products which are permanently\r\naëriform are entirely lost, and even such as difficultly lose that state\r\nhave not sufficient space to condense in the balloon: This apparatus is\r\nnot, therefore, proper for experiments of investigation, and can only be\r\nadmitted in the ordinary operations of the laboratory or in pharmacy. In\r\nthe article appropriated for compound distillation, I shall explain the\r\nvarious methods which have been contrived for preserving the whole\r\nproducts from bodies in this process.\r\n\r\nAs glass or earthen vessels are very brittle, and do not readily bear\r\nsudden alterations of heat and cold, every well regulated laboratory\r\nought to have one or more alembics of metal for distilling water,\r\nspiritous liquors, essential oils, &c. This apparatus consists of a\r\ncucurbit and capital of tinned copper or brass, Pl. III. Fig. 15. and\r\n16. which, when judged proper, may be placed in the water bath, D, Fig.\r\n17. In distillations, especially of spiritous liquors, the capital must\r\nbe furnished with a refrigetory, SS, Fig. 16. kept continually filled\r\nwith cold water; when the water becomes heated, it is let off by the\r\nstop-cock, R, and renewed with a fresh supply of cold water. As the\r\nfluid distilled is converted into gas by means of caloric furnished by\r\nthe fire of the furnace, it is evident that it could not condense, and,\r\nconsequently, that no distillation, properly speaking, could take place,\r\nunless it is made to deposit in the capital all the caloric it received\r\nin the cucurbit; with this view, the sides of the capital must always be\r\npreserved at a lower temperature than is necessary for keeping the\r\ndistilling substance in the state of gas, and the water in the\r\nrefrigetory is intended for this purpose. Water is converted into gas\r\nby the temperature of 80° (212°), alkohol by 67° (182.75°), ether by 32°\r\n(104°); hence these substances cannot be distilled, or, rather, they\r\nwill fly off in the state of gas, unless the temperature of the\r\nrefrigetory be kept under these respective degrees.\r\n\r\nIn the distillation of spiritous, and other expansive liquors, the above\r\ndescribed refrigetory is not sufficient for condensing all the vapours\r\nwhich arise; in this case, therefore, instead of receiving the distilled\r\nliquor immediately from the beak, TU, of the capital into a recipient, a\r\nworm is interposed between them. This instrument is represented Pl. III.\r\nFig. 18. contained in a worm tub of tinned copper, it consists of a\r\nmetallic tube bent into a considerable number of spiral revolutions. The\r\nvessel which contains the worm is kept full of cold water, which is\r\nrenewed as it grows warm. This contrivance is employed in all\r\ndistilleries of spirits, without the intervention of a capital and\r\nrefrigetory, properly so called. The one represented in the plate is\r\nfurnished with two worms, one of them being particularly appropriated to\r\ndistillations of odoriferous substances.\r\n\r\nIn some simple distillations it is necessary to interpose an adopter\r\nbetween the retort and receiver, as shown Pl. III. Fig, 11. This may\r\nserve two different purposes, either to separate two products of\r\ndifferent degrees of volatility, or to remove the receiver to a greater\r\ndistance from the furnace, that it may be less heated. But these, and\r\nseveral other more complicated instruments of ancient contrivance, are\r\nfar from producing the accuracy requisite in modern chemistry, as will\r\nbe readily perceived when I come to treat of compound distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Sublimation._\r\n\r\nThis term is applied to the distillation of substances which condense in\r\na concrete or solid form, such as the sublimation of sulphur, and of\r\nmuriat of ammoniac, or sal ammoniac. These operations may be\r\nconveniently performed in the ordinary distilling vessels already\r\ndescribed, though, in the sublimation of sulphur, a species of vessels,\r\nnamed Alludels, have been usually employed. These are vessels of stone\r\nor porcelain ware, which adjust to each other over a cucurbit containing\r\nthe sulphur to be sublimed. One of the best subliming vessels, for\r\nsubstances which are not very volatile, is a flask, or phial of glass,\r\nsunk about two thirds into a sand bath; but in this way we are apt to\r\nlose a part of the products. When these are wished to be entirely\r\npreserved, we must have recourse to the pneumato-chemical distilling\r\napparatus, to be described in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Pneumato-chemical Distillations, Metallic Dissolutions, and some\r\nother operations which require very complicated instruments._\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n_Of Compound and Pneumato-chemical Distillations._\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, I have only treated of distillation as a\r\nsimple operation, by which two substances, differing in degrees of\r\nvolatility, may be separated from each other; but distillation often\r\nactually decomposes the substances submitted to its action, and becomes\r\none of the most complicated operations in chemistry. In every\r\ndistillation, the substance distilled must be brought to the state of\r\ngas, in the cucurbit or retort, by combination with caloric: In simple\r\ndistillation, this caloric is given out in the refrigeratory or in the\r\nworm, and the substance again recovers its liquid or solid form, but the\r\nsubstances submitted to compound distillation are absolutely\r\ndecompounded; one part, as for instance the charcoal they contain,\r\nremains fixed in the retort, and all the rest of the elements are\r\nreduced to gasses of different kinds. Some of these are susceptible of\r\nbeing condensed, and of recovering their solid or liquid forms, whilst\r\nothers are permanently aëriform; one part of these are absorbable by\r\nwater, some by the alkalies, and others are not susceptible of being\r\nabsorbed at all. An ordinary distilling apparatus, such as has been\r\ndescribed in the preceding chapter, is quite insufficient for retaining\r\nor for separating these diversified products, and we are obliged to have\r\nrecourse, for this purpose, to methods of a more complicated nature.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus I am about to describe is calculated for the most\r\ncomplicated distillations, and may be simplified according to\r\ncircumstances. It consists of a tubulated glass retort A, Pl. IV. Fig.\r\n1. having its beak fitted to a tubulated balloon or recipient BC; to the\r\nupper orifice D of the balloon a bent tube DEfg is adjusted, which, at\r\nits other extremity g, is plunged into the liquor contained in the\r\nbottle L, with three necks xxx. Three other similar bottles are\r\nconnected with this first one, by means of three similar bent tubes\r\ndisposed in the same manner; and the farthest neck of the last bottle is\r\nconnected with a jar in a pneumato-chemical apparatus, by means of a\r\nbent tube[60]. A determinate weight of distilled water is usually put\r\ninto the first bottle, and the other three have each a solution of\r\ncaustic potash in water. The weight of all these bottles, and of the\r\nwater and alkaline solution they contain, must be accurately\r\nascertained. Every thing being thus disposed, the junctures between the\r\nretort and recipient, and of the tube D of the latter, must be luted\r\nwith fat lute, covered over with slips of linen, spread with lime and\r\nwhite of egg; all the other junctures are to be secured by a lute made\r\nof wax and rosin melted together.\r\n\r\nWhen all these dispositions are completed, and when, by means of heat\r\napplied to the retort A, the substance it contains becomes decomposed,\r\nit is evident that the least volatile products must condense or sublime\r\nin the beak or neck of the retort itself, where most of the concrete\r\nsubstances will fix themselves. The more volatile substances, as the\r\nlighter oils, ammoniac, and several others, will condense in the\r\nrecipient GC, whilst the gasses, which are not susceptible of\r\ncondensation by cold, will pass on by the tubes, and boil up through the\r\nliquors in the several bottles. Such as are absorbable by water will\r\nremain in the first bottle, and those which caustic alkali can absorb\r\nwill remain in the others; whilst such gasses as are not susceptible of\r\nabsorption, either by water or alkalies, will escape by the tube RM, at\r\nthe end of which they may be received into jars in a pneumato-chemical\r\napparatus. The charcoal and fixed earth, &c. which form the substance or\r\nresiduum, anciently called _caput mortuum_, remain behind in the retort.\r\n\r\nIn this manner of operating, we have always a very material proof of the\r\naccuracy of the analysis, as the whole weights of the products taken\r\ntogether, after the process is finished, must be exactly equal to the\r\nweight of the original substance submitted to distillation. Hence, for\r\ninstance, if we have operated upon eight ounces of starch or gum arabic,\r\nthe weight of the charry residuum in the retort, together with that of\r\nall the products gathered in its neck and the balloon, and of all the\r\ngas received into the jars by the tube RM added to the additional weight\r\nacquired by the bottles, must, when taken together, be exactly eight\r\nounces. If the product be less or more, it proceeds from error, and the\r\nexperiment must be repeated until a satisfactory result be procured,\r\nwhich ought not to differ more than six or eight grains in the pound\r\nfrom the weight of the substance submitted to experiment.\r\n\r\nIn experiments of this kind, I for a long time met with an almost\r\ninsurmountable difficulty, which must at last have obliged me to desist\r\naltogether, but for a very simple method of avoiding it, pointed out to\r\nme by Mr Hassenfratz. The smallest diminution in the heat of the\r\nfurnace, and many other circumstances inseparable from this kind of\r\nexperiments, cause frequent reabsorptions of gas; the water in the\r\ncistern of the pneumato-chemical apparatus rushes into the last bottle\r\nthrough the tube RM, the same circumstance happens from one bottle into\r\nanother, and the fluid is often forced even into the recipient C. This\r\naccident is prevented by using bottles having three necks, as\r\nrepresented in the plate, into one of which, in each bottle, a capillary\r\nglass-tube St, st, st, st, is adapted, so as to have its lower\r\nextremity t immersed in the liquor. If any absorption takes place,\r\neither in the retort, or in any of the bottles, a sufficient quantity of\r\nexternal air enters, by means of these tubes, to fill up the void; and\r\nwe get rid of the inconvenience at the price of having a small mixture\r\nof common air with the products of the experiment, which is thereby\r\nprevented from failing altogether. Though these tubes admit the external\r\nair, they cannot permit any of the gasseous substances to escape, as\r\nthey are always shut below by the water of the bottles.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, in the course of experiments with this apparatus,\r\nthe liquor of the bottles must rise in these tubes in proportion to the\r\npressure sustained by the gas or air contained in the bottles; and this\r\npressure is determined by the height and gravity of the column of fluid\r\ncontained in all the subsequent bottles. If we suppose that each bottle\r\ncontains three inches of fluid, and that there are three inches of water\r\nin the cistern of the connected apparatus above the orifice of the tube\r\nRM, and allowing the gravity of the fluids to be only equal to that of\r\nwater, it follows that the air in the first bottle must sustain a\r\npressure equal to twelve inches of water; the water must therefore rise\r\ntwelve inches in the tube S, connected with the first bottle, nine\r\ninches in that belonging to the second, six inches in the third, and\r\nthree in the last; wherefore these tubes must be made somewhat more than\r\ntwelve, nine, six, and three inches long respectively, allowance being\r\nmade for oscillatory motions, which often take place in the liquids. It\r\nis sometimes necessary to introduce a similar tube between the retort\r\nand recipient; and, as the tube is not immersed in fluid at its lower\r\nextremity, until some has collected in the progress of the distillation,\r\nits upper end must be shut at first with a little lute, so as to be\r\nopened according to necessity, or after there is sufficient liquid in\r\nthe recipient to secure its lower extremity.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus cannot be used in very accurate experiments, when the\r\nsubstances intended to be operated upon have a very rapid action upon\r\neach other, or when one of them can only be introduced in small\r\nsuccessive portions, as in such as produce violent effervescence when\r\nmixed together. In such cases, we employ a tubulated retort A, Pl. VII.\r\nFig. 1. into which one of the substances is introduced, preferring\r\nalways the solid body, if any such is to be treated, we then lute to the\r\nopening of the retort a bent tube BCDA, terminating at its upper\r\nextremity B in a funnel, and at its other end A in a capillary opening.\r\nThe fluid material of the experiment is poured into the retort by means\r\nof this funnel, which must be made of such a length, from B to C, that\r\nthe column of liquid introduced may counterbalance the resistance\r\nproduced by the liquors contained in all the bottles, Pl. IV. Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThose who have not been accustomed to use the above described distilling\r\napparatus may perhaps be startled at the great number of openings which\r\nrequire luting, and the time necessary for making all the previous\r\npreparations in experiments of this kind. It is very true that, if we\r\ntake into account all the necessary weighings of materials and products,\r\nboth before and after the experiments, these preparatory and succeeding\r\nsteps require much more time and attention than the experiment itself.\r\nBut, when the experiment succeeds properly, we are well rewarded for all\r\nthe time and trouble bestowed, as by one process carried on in this\r\naccurate manner much more just and extensive knowledge is acquired of\r\nthe nature of the vegetable or animal substance thus submitted to\r\ninvestigation, than by many weeks assiduous labour in the ordinary\r\nmethod of proceeding.\r\n\r\nWhen in want of bottles with three orifices, those with two may be used;\r\nit is even possible to introduce all the three tubes at one opening, so\r\nas to employ ordinary wide-mouthed bottles, provided the opening be\r\nsufficiently large. In this case we must carefully fit the bottles with\r\ncorks very accurately cut, and boiled in a mixture of oil, wax, and\r\nturpentine. These corks are pierced with the necessary holes for\r\nreceiving the tubes by means of a round file, as in Pl. IV. Fig. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n_Of Metallic Dissolutions._\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out the difference between solution of salts in\r\nwater and metallic dissolutions. The former requires no particular\r\nvessels, whereas the latter requires very complicated vessels of late\r\ninvention, that we may not lose any of the products of the experiment,\r\nand may thereby procure truly conclusive results of the phenomena which\r\noccur. The metals, in general, dissolve in acids with effervescence,\r\nwhich is only a motion excited in the solvent by the disengagement of a\r\ngreat number of bubbles of air or aëriform fluid, which proceed from the\r\nsurface of the metal, and break at the surface of the liquid.\r\n\r\nMr Cavendish and Dr Priestley were the first inventors of a proper\r\napparatus for collecting these elastic fluids. That of Dr Priestley is\r\nextremely simple, and consists of a bottle A, Pl. VII. Fig. 2. with its\r\ncork B, through which passes the bent glass tube BC, which is engaged\r\nunder a jar filled with water in the pneumato-chemical apparatus, or\r\nsimply in a bason full of water. The metal is first introduced into the\r\nbottle, the acid is then poured over it, and the bottle is instantly\r\nclosed with its cork and tube, as represented in the plate. But this\r\napparatus has its inconveniencies. When the acid is much concentrated,\r\nor the metal much divided, the effervescence begins before we have time\r\nto cork the bottle properly, and some gas escapes, by which we are\r\nprevented from ascertaining the quantity disengaged with rigorous\r\nexactness. In the next place, when we are obliged to employ heat, or\r\nwhen heat is produced by the process, a part of the acid distills, and\r\nmixes with the water of the pneumato-chemical apparatus, by which means\r\nwe are deceived in our calculation of the quantity of acid decomposed.\r\nBesides these, the water in the cistern of the apparatus absorbs all the\r\ngas produced which is susceptible of absorption, and renders it\r\nimpossible to collect these without loss.\r\n\r\nTo remedy these inconveniencies, I at first used a bottle with two\r\nnecks, Pl. VII. Fig. 3. into one of which the glass funnel BC is luted\r\nso as to prevent any air escaping; a glass rod DE is fitted with emery\r\nto the funnel, so as to serve the purpose of a stopper. When it is used,\r\nthe matter to be dissolved is first introduced into the bottle, and the\r\nacid is then permitted to pass in as slowly as we please, by raising the\r\nglass rod gently as often as is necessary until saturation is produced.\r\n\r\nAnother method has been since employed, which serves the same purpose,\r\nand is preferable to the last described in some instances. This consists\r\nin adapting to one of the mouths of the bottle A, Pl. VII. Fig. 4. a\r\nbent tube DEFG, having a capillary opening at D, and ending in a funnel\r\nat G. This tube is securely luted to the mouth C of the bottle. When any\r\nliquid is poured into the funnel, it falls down to F; and, if a\r\nsufficient quantity be added, it passes by the curvature E, and falls\r\nslowly into the bottle, so long as fresh liquor is supplied at the\r\nfunnel. The liquor can never be forced out of the tube, and no gas can\r\nescape through it, because the weight of the liquid serves the purpose\r\nof an accurate cork.\r\n\r\nTo prevent any distillation of acid, especially in dissolutions\r\naccompanied with heat, this tube is adapted to the retort A, Pl. VII.\r\nFig. 1. and a small tubulated recipient, M, is applied, in which any\r\nliquor which may distill is condensed. On purpose to separate any gas\r\nthat is absorbable by water, we add the double necked bottle L, half\r\nfilled with a solution of caustic potash; the alkali absorbs any\r\ncarbonic acid gas, and usually only one or two other gasses pass into\r\nthe jar of the connected pneumato-chemical apparatus through the tube\r\nNO. In the first chapter of this third part we have directed how these\r\nare to be separated and examined. If one bottle of alkaline solution be\r\nnot thought sufficient, two, three, or more, may be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus necessary in Experiments upon Vinous and Putrefactive\r\nFermentations._\r\n\r\nFor these operations a peculiar apparatus, especially intended for this\r\nkind of experiment, is requisite. The one I am about to describe is\r\nfinally adopted, as the best calculated for the purpose, after numerous\r\ncorrections and improvements. It consists of a large matrass, A, Pl. X.\r\nfig. 1. holding about twelve pints, with a cap of brass a b, strongly\r\ncemented to its mouth, and into which is screwed a bent tube c d,\r\nfurnished with a stop-cock e. To this tube is joined the glass\r\nrecipient B, having three openings, one of which communicates with the\r\nbottle C, placed below it. To the posterior opening of this recipient is\r\nfitted a glass tube g h i, cemented at g and i to collets of\r\nbrass, and intended to contain a very deliquescent concrete neutral\r\nsalt, such as nitrat or muriat of lime, acetite of potash, &c. This tube\r\ncommunicates with two bottles D and E, filled to x and y with a\r\nsolution of caustic potash.\r\n\r\nAll the parts of this machine are joined together by accurate screws,\r\nand the touching parts have greased leather interposed, to prevent any\r\npassage of air. Each piece is likewise furnished with two stop-cocks, by\r\nwhich its two extremities may be closed, so that we can weigh each\r\nseparately at any period of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe fermentable matter, such as sugar, with a proper quantity of yeast,\r\nand diluted with water, is put into the matrass. Sometimes, when the\r\nfermentation is too rapid, a considerable quantity of froth is produced,\r\nwhich not only fills the neck of the matrass, but passes into the\r\nrecipient, and from thence runs down into the bottle C. On purpose to\r\ncollect this scum and must, and to prevent it from reaching the tube\r\nfilled with deliquescent salts, the recipient and connected bottle are\r\nmade of considerable capacity.\r\n\r\nIn the vinous fermentation, only carbonic acid gas is disengaged,\r\ncarrying with it a small proportion of water in solution. A great part\r\nof this water is deposited in passing through the tube g h i, which is\r\nfilled with a deliquescent salt in gross powder, and the quantity is\r\nascertained by the augmentation of the weight of the salt. The carbonic\r\nacid gas bubbles up through the alkaline solution in the bottle D, to\r\nwhich it is conveyed by the tube k l m. Any small portion which may\r\nnot be absorbed by this first bottle is secured by the solution in the\r\nsecond bottle E, so that nothing, in general, passes into the jar F,\r\nexcept the common air contained in the vessels at the commencement of\r\nthe experiment.\r\n\r\nThe same apparatus answers extremely well for experiments upon the\r\nputrefactive fermentation; but, in this case, a considerable quantity of\r\nhydrogen gas is disengaged through the tube q r s t u, by which it is\r\nconveyed into the jar F; and, as this disengagement is very rapid,\r\nespecially in summer, the jar must be frequently changed. These\r\nputrefactive fermentations require constant attendance from the above\r\ncircumstance, whereas the vinous fermentation hardly needs any. By means\r\nof this apparatus we can ascertain, with great precision, the weights of\r\nthe substances submitted to fermentation, and of the liquid and aëriform\r\nproducts which are disengaged. What has been already said in Part I.\r\nChap. XIII. upon the products of the vinous fermentation, may be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.\r\n\r\n_Apparatus for the Decomposition of Water._\r\n\r\nHaving already given an account, in the first part of this work, of the\r\nexperiments relative to the decomposition of water, I shall avoid any\r\nunnecessary repetitions, and only give a few summary observations upon\r\nthe subject in this section. The principal substances which have the\r\npower of decomposing water are iron and charcoal; for which purpose,\r\nthey require to be made red hot, otherwise the water is only reduced\r\ninto vapours, and condenses afterwards by refrigeration, without\r\nsustaining the smallest alteration. In a red heat, on the contrary, iron\r\nor charcoal carry off the oxygen from its union with hydrogen; in the\r\nfirst case, black oxyd of iron is produced, and the hydrogen is\r\ndisengaged pure in form of gas; in the other case, carbonic acid gas is\r\nformed, which disengages, mixed with the hydrogen gas; and this latter\r\nis commonly carbonated, or holds charcoal in solution.\r\n\r\nA musket barrel, without its breach pin, answers exceedingly well for\r\nthe decomposition of water, by means of iron, and one should be chosen\r\nof considerable length, and pretty strong. When too short, so as to run\r\nthe risk of heating the lute too much, a tube of copper is to be\r\nstrongly soldered to one end. The barrel is placed in a long furnace,\r\nCDEF, Pl. VII. Fig. 11. so as to have a few degrees of inclination from\r\nE to F; a glass retort A, is luted to the upper extremity E, which\r\ncontains water, and is placed upon the furnace VVXX. The lower extremity\r\nF is luted to a worm SS, which is connected with the tubulated bottle H,\r\nin which any water distilled without decomposition, during the\r\noperation, collects, and the disengaged gas is carried by the tube KK to\r\njars in a pneumato-chemical apparatus. Instead of the retort a funnel\r\nmay be employed, having its lower part shut by a stop-cock, through\r\nwhich the water is allowed to drop gradually into the gun-barrel.\r\nImmediately upon getting into contact with the heated part of the iron,\r\nthe water is converted into steam, and the experiment proceeds in the\r\nsame manner as if it were furnished in vapours from the retort.\r\n\r\nIn the experiment made by Mr Meusnier and me before a committee of the\r\nAcademy, we used every precaution to obtain the greatest possible\r\nprecision in the result of our experiment, having even exhausted all the\r\nvessels employed before we began, so that the hydrogen gas obtained\r\nmight be free from any mixture of azotic gas. The results of that\r\nexperiment will hereafter be given at large in a particular memoir.\r\n\r\nIn numerous experiments, we are obliged to use tubes of glass,\r\nporcelain, or copper, instead of gun-barrels; but glass has the\r\ndisadvantage of being easily melted and flattened, if the heat be in the\r\nsmallest degree raised too high; and porcelain is mostly full of small\r\nminute pores, through which the gas escapes, especially when compressed\r\nby a column of water. For these reasons I procured a tube of brass,\r\nwhich Mr de la Briche got cast and bored out of the solid for me at\r\nStrasburg, under his own inspection. This tube is extremely convenient\r\nfor decomposing alkohol, which resolves into charcoal, carbonic acid\r\ngas, and hydrogen gas; it may likewise be used with the same advantage\r\nfor decomposing water by means of charcoal, and in a great number of\r\nexperiments of this nature.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] The representation of this apparatus, Pl. IV. Fig. 1. will convey a\r\nmuch better idea of its disposition than can possibly be given by the\r\nmost laboured description.--E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Composition and Application of Lutes._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessity of properly securing the junctures of chemical vessels to\r\nprevent the escape of any of the products of experiments, must be\r\nsufficiently apparent; for this purpose lutes are employed, which ought\r\nto be of such a nature as to be equally impenetrable to the most subtile\r\nsubstances, as glass itself, through which only caloric can escape.\r\n\r\nThis first object of lutes is very well accomplished by bees wax, melted\r\nwith about an eighth part of turpentine. This lute is very easily\r\nmanaged, sticks very closely to glass, and is very difficultly\r\npenetrable; it may be rendered more consistent, and less or more hard or\r\npliable, by adding different kinds of resinous matters. Though this\r\nspecies of lute answers extremely well for retaining gasses and vapours,\r\nthere are many chemical experiments which produce considerable heat, by\r\nwhich this lute becomes liquified, and consequently the expansive\r\nvapours must very readily force through and escape.\r\n\r\nFor such cases, the following fat lute is the best hitherto discovered,\r\nthough not without its disadvantages, which shall be pointed out. Take\r\nvery pure and dry unbaked clay, reduced to a very fine powder, put this\r\ninto a brass mortar, and beat it for several hours with a heavy iron\r\npestle, dropping in slowly some boiled lintseed oil; this is oil which\r\nhas been oxygenated, and has acquired a drying quality, by being boiled\r\nwith litharge. This lute is more tenacious, and applies better, if amber\r\nvarnish be used instead of the above oil. To make this varnish, melt\r\nsome yellow amber in an iron laddle, by which operation it loses a part\r\nof its succinic acid, and essential oil, and mix it with lintseed oil.\r\nThough the lute prepared with this varnish is better than that made with\r\nboiled oil, yet, as its additional expence is hardly compensated by its\r\nsuperior quality, it is seldom used.\r\n\r\nThe above fat lute is capable of sustaining a very violent degree of\r\nheat, is impenetrable by acids and spiritous liquors, and adheres\r\nexceedingly well to metals, stone ware, or glass, providing they have\r\nbeen previously rendered perfectly dry. But if, unfortunately, any of\r\nthe liquor in the course of an experiment gets through, either between\r\nthe glass and the lute, or between the layers of the lute itself, so as\r\nto moisten the part, it is extremely difficult to close the opening.\r\nThis is the chief inconvenience which attends the use of fat lute, and\r\nperhaps the only one it is subject to. As it is apt to soften by heat,\r\nwe must surround all the junctures with slips of wet bladder applied\r\nover the luting, and fixed on by pack-thread tied round both above and\r\nbelow the joint; the bladder, and consequently the lute below, must be\r\nfarther secured by a number of turns of pack-thread all over it. By\r\nthese precautions, we are free from every danger of accident; and the\r\njunctures secured in this manner may be considered, in experiments, as\r\nhermetically sealed.\r\n\r\nIt frequently happens that the figure of the junctures prevents the\r\napplication of ligatures, which is the case with the three-necked\r\nbottles formerly described; and it even requires great address to apply\r\nthe twine without shaking the apparatus; so that, where a number of\r\njunctures require luting, we are apt to displace several while securing\r\none. In these cases, we may substitute slips of linen, spread with white\r\nof egg and lime mixed together, instead of the wet bladder. These are\r\napplied while still moist, and very speedily dry and acquire\r\nconsiderable hardness. Strong glue dissolved in water may answer instead\r\nof white of egg. These fillets are usefully applied likewise over\r\njunctures luted together with wax and rosin.\r\n\r\nBefore applying a lute, all the junctures of the vessels must be\r\naccurately and firmly fitted to each other, so as not to admit of being\r\nmoved. If the beak of a retort is to be luted to the neck of a\r\nrecipient, they ought to fit pretty accurately; otherwise we must fix\r\nthem, by introducing short pieces of soft wood or of cork. If the\r\ndisproportion between the two be very considerable, we must employ a\r\ncork which fits the neck of the recipient, having a circular hole of\r\nproper dimensions to admit the beak of the retort. The same precaution\r\nis necessary in adapting bent tubes to the necks of bottles in the\r\napparatus represented Pl. IV. Fig. 1. and others of a similar nature.\r\nEach mouth of each bottle must be fitted with a cork, having a hole made\r\nwith a round file of a proper size for containing the tube. And, when\r\none mouth is intended to admit two or more tubes, which frequently\r\nhappens when we have not a sufficient number of bottles with two or\r\nthree necks, we must use a cork with two or three holes, Pl. IV. Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole apparatus is thus solidly joined, so that no part can\r\nplay upon another, we begin to lute. The lute is softened by kneading\r\nand rolling it between the fingers, with the assistance of heat, if\r\nnecessary. It is rolled into little cylindrical pieces, and applied to\r\nthe junctures, taking great care to make it apply close, and adhere\r\nfirmly, in every part; a second roll is applied over the first, so as to\r\npass it on each side, and so on till each juncture be sufficiently\r\ncovered; after this, the slips of bladder, or of linen, as above\r\ndirected, must be carefully applied over all. Though this operation may\r\nappear extremely simple, yet it requires peculiar delicacy and\r\nmanagement; great care must be taken not to disturb one juncture whilst\r\nluting another, and more especially when applying the fillets and\r\nligatures.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning any experiment, the closeness of the luting ought\r\nalways to be previously tried, either by slightly heating the retort A,\r\nPl. IV. Fig. 1, or by blowing in a little air by some of the\r\nperpendicular tubes S s s s; the alteration of pressure causes a\r\nchange in the level of the liquid in these tubes. If the apparatus be\r\naccurately luted, this alteration of level will be permanent; whereas,\r\nif there be the smallest, opening in any of the junctures, the liquid\r\nwill very soon recover its former level. It must always be remembered,\r\nthat the whole success of experiments in modern chemistry depends upon\r\nthe exactness of this operation, which therefore requires the utmost\r\npatience, and most attentive accuracy.\r\n\r\nIt would be of infinite service to enable chemists, especially those who\r\nare engaged in pneumatic processes, to dispense with the use of lutes,\r\nor at least to diminish the number necessary in complicated instruments.\r\nI once thought of having my apparatus constructed so as to unite in all\r\nits parts by fitting with emery, in the way of bottles with cristal\r\nstoppers; but the execution of this plan was extremely difficult. I have\r\nsince thought it preferable to substitute columns of a few lines of\r\nmercury in place of lutes, and have got an apparatus constructed upon\r\nthis principle, which appears capable of very convenient application in\r\na great number of circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a double necked bottle A, Pl. XII. Fig. 12.; the interior\r\nneck bc communicates with the inside of the bottle, and the exterior\r\nneck or rim de leaves an interval between the two necks, forming a\r\ndeep gutter intended to contain the mercury. The cap or lid of glass B\r\nenters this gutter, and is properly fitted to it, having notches in its\r\nlower edge for the passage of the tubes which convey the gas. These\r\ntubes, instead of entering directly into the bottles as in the ordinary\r\napparatus, have a double bend for making them enter the gutter, as\r\nrepresented in Fig. 13. and for making them fit the notches of the cap\r\nB; they rise again from the gutter to enter the inside of the bottle\r\nover the border of the inner mouth. When the tubes are disposed in their\r\nproper places, and the cap firmly fitted on, the gutter is filled with\r\nmercury, by which means the bottle is completely excluded from any\r\ncommunication, excepting through the tubes. This apparatus may be very\r\nconvenient in many operations in which the substances employed have no\r\naction upon Mercury. Pl. XII. Fig. 14. represents an apparatus upon this\r\nprinciple properly fitted together.\r\n\r\nMr Seguin, to whose active and intelligent assistance I have been very\r\nfrequently much indebted, has bespoken for me, at the glass-houses, some\r\nretorts hermetically united to their recipients, by which luting will be\r\naltogether unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of Operations upon Combustion and Deflagration._\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n_Of Combustion in general._\r\n\r\nCombustion, according to what has been already said in the First Part of\r\nthis Work, is the decomposition of oxygen gas produced by a combustible\r\nbody. The oxygen which forms the base of this gas is absorbed by, and\r\nenters into, combination with the burning body, while the caloric and\r\nlight are set free. Every combustion, therefore, necessarily supposes\r\noxygenation; whereas, on the contrary, every oxygenation does not\r\nnecessarily imply concomitant combustion; because combustion, properly\r\nso called, cannot take place without disengagement of caloric and light.\r\nBefore combustion can take place, it is necessary that the base of\r\noxygen gas should have greater affinity to the combustible body than it\r\nhas to caloric; and this elective attraction, to use Bergman's\r\nexpression, can only take place at a certain degree of temperature,\r\nwhich is different for each combustible substance; hence the necessity\r\nof giving a first motion or beginning to every combustion by the\r\napproach of a heated body. This necessity of heating any body we mean to\r\nburn depends upon certain considerations, which have not hitherto been\r\nattended to by any natural philosopher, for which reason I shall enlarge\r\na little upon the subject in this place.\r\n\r\nNature is at present in a state of equilibrium, which cannot have been\r\nattained until all the spontaneous combustions or oxygenations possible\r\nin the ordinary degrees of temperature had taken place. Hence, no new\r\ncombustions or oxygenations can happen without destroying this\r\nequilibrium, and raising the combustible substances to a superior degree\r\nof temperature. To illustrate this abstract view of the matter by\r\nexample: Let us suppose the usual temperature of the earth a little\r\nchanged, and that it is raised only to the degree of boiling water; it\r\nis evident, that, in this case, phosphorus, which is combustible in a\r\nconsiderably lower degree of temperature, would no longer exist in\r\nnature in its pure and simple state, but would always be procured in its\r\nacid or oxygenated state, and its radical would become one of the\r\nsubstances unknown to chemistry. By gradually increasing the\r\ntemperature of the earth the same circumstance would successively happen\r\nto all the bodies capable of combustion; and, at last, every possible\r\ncombustion having taken place, there would no longer exist any\r\ncombustible body whatever, as every substance susceptible of that\r\noperation would be oxygenated, and consequently incombustible.\r\n\r\nThere cannot therefore exist, so far as relates to us, any combustible\r\nbody, except such as are incombustible in the ordinary temperatures of\r\nthe earth; or, what is the same thing, in other words, that it is\r\nessential to the nature of every combustible body not to possess the\r\nproperty of combustion, unless heated, or raised to the degree of\r\ntemperature at which its combustion naturally takes place. When this\r\ndegree is once produced, combustion commences, and the caloric which is\r\ndisengaged by the decomposition of the oxygen gas keeps up the\r\ntemperature necessary for continuing combustion. When this is not the\r\ncase, that is, when the disengaged caloric is insufficient for keeping\r\nup the necessary temperature, the combustion ceases: This circumstance\r\nis expressed in common language by saying, that a body burns ill, or\r\nwith difficulty.\r\n\r\nAlthough combustion possesses some circumstances in common with\r\ndistillation, especially with the compound kind of that operation, they\r\ndiffer in a very material point. In distillation there is a separation\r\nof one part of the elements of the substance from each other, and a\r\ncombination of these, in a new order, occasioned by the affinities which\r\ntake place in the increased temperature produced during distillation:\r\nThis likewise happens in combustion, but with this farther circumstance,\r\nthat a new element, not originally in the body, is brought into action;\r\noxygen is added to the substance submitted to the operation, and caloric\r\nis disengaged.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of employing oxygen in the state of gas in all experiments\r\nwith combustion, and the rigorous determination of the quantities\r\nemployed, render this kind of operations peculiarly troublesome. As\r\nalmost all the products of combustion are disengaged in the state of\r\ngas, it is still more difficult to retain them than even those furnished\r\nduring compound distillation; hence this precaution was entirely\r\nneglected by the ancient chemists; and this set of experiments\r\nexclusively belong to modern chemistry.\r\n\r\nHaving thus pointed out, in a general way, the objects to be had in view\r\nin experiments upon combustion, I proceed, in the following sections of\r\nthis chapter, to describe the different instruments I have used with\r\nthis view. The following arrangement is formed, not upon the nature of\r\nthe combustible bodies, but upon that of the instruments necessary for\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n_Of the Combustion of Phosphorus._\r\n\r\nIn these combustions we begin by filling a jar, capable at least of\r\nholding six pints, with oxygen gas in the water apparatus, Pl. V. Fig.\r\n1.; when it is perfectly full, so that the gas begins to flow out below,\r\nthe jar, A, is carried to the mercury apparatus, Pl. IV. Fig. 3. We then\r\ndry the surface of the mercury, both within and without the jar, by\r\nmeans of blotting-paper, taking care to keep the paper for some time\r\nentirely immersed in the mercury before it is introduced under the jar,\r\nlest we let in any common air, which sticks very obstinately to the\r\nsurface of the paper. The body to be submitted to combustion, being\r\nfirst very accurately weighed in nice scales, is placed in a small flat\r\nshallow dish, D, of iron or porcelain; this is covered by the larger cup\r\nP, which serves the office of a diving bell, and the whole is passed\r\nthrough the mercury into the jar, after which the larger cup is retired.\r\nThe difficulty of passing the materials of combustion in this manner\r\nthrough the mercury may be avoided by raising one of the sides of the\r\njar, A, for a moment, and slipping in the little cup, D, with the\r\ncombustible body as quickly as possible. In this manner of operating, a\r\nsmall quantity of common air gets into the jar, but it is so very\r\ninconsiderable as not to injure either the progress or accuracy of the\r\nexperiment in any sensible degree.\r\n\r\nWhen the cup, D, is introduced under the jar, we suck out a part of the\r\noxygen gas, so as to raise the mercury to EF, as formerly directed, Part\r\nI. Chap. V. otherwise, when the combustible body is set on fire, the gas\r\nbecoming dilated would be in part forced out, and we should no longer be\r\nable to make any accurate calculation of the quantities before and after\r\nthe experiment. A very convenient mode of drawing out the air is by\r\nmeans of an air-pump syringe adapted to the syphon, GHI, by which the\r\nmercury may be raised to any degree under twenty-eight inches. Very\r\ninflammable bodies, as phosphorus, are set on fire by means of the\r\ncrooked iron wire, MN, Pl. IV. Fig. 16. made red hot, and passed quickly\r\nthrough the mercury. Such as are less easily set on fire have a small\r\nportion of tinder, upon which a minute particle of phosphorus is fixed,\r\nlaid upon them before using the red hot iron.\r\n\r\nIn the first moment of combustion the air, being heated, rarifies, and\r\nthe mercury descends; but when, as in combustions of phosphorus and\r\niron, no elastic fluid is formed, absorption becomes presently very\r\nsensible, and the mercury rises high into the jar. Great attention must\r\nbe used not to burn too large a quantity of any substance in a given\r\nquantity of gas, otherwise, towards the end of the experiment, the cup\r\nwould approach so near the top of the jar as to endanger breaking it by\r\nthe great heat produced, and the sudden refrigeration from the cold\r\nmercury. For the methods of measuring the volume of the gasses, and for\r\ncorrecting the measures according to the heighth of the barometer and\r\nthermometer, &c. see Chap. II. Sect. V. and VI. of this part.\r\n\r\nThe above process answers very well for burning all the concrete\r\nsubstances, and even for the fixed oils: These last are burnt in lamps\r\nunder the jar, and are readily set on fire by means of tinder,\r\nphosphorus, and hot iron. But it is dangerous for substances susceptible\r\nof evaporating in a moderate heat, such as ether, alkohol, and the\r\nessential oils; these substances dissolve in considerable quantity in\r\noxygen gas; and, when set on fire, a dangerous and sudden explosion\r\ntakes place, which carries up the jar to a great height, and dashes it\r\nin a thousand pieces. From two such explosions some of the members of\r\nthe Academy and myself escaped very narrowly. Besides, though this\r\nmanner of operating is sufficient for determining pretty accurately the\r\nquantity of oxygen gas absorbed, and of carbonic acid produced, as water\r\nis likewise formed in all experiments upon vegetable and animal matters\r\nwhich contain an excess of hydrogen, this apparatus can neither collect\r\nit nor determine its quantity. The experiment with phosphorus is even\r\nincomplete in this way, as it is impossible to demonstrate that the\r\nweight of the phosphoric acid produced is equal to the sum of the\r\nweights of the phosphorus burnt and oxygen gas absorbed during the\r\nprocess. I have been therefore obliged to vary the instruments according\r\nto circumstances, and to employ several of different kinds, which I\r\nshall describe in their order, beginning with that used for burning\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nTake a large balloon, A, Pl. IV. Fig. 4. of cristal or white glass, with\r\nan opening, EF, about two inches and a half, or three inches, diameter,\r\nto which a cap of brass is accurately fitted with emery, and which has\r\ntwo holes for the passage of the tubes xxx, yyy. Before shutting the\r\nballoon with its cover, place within it the stand, BC, supporting the\r\ncup of porcelain, D, which contains the phosphorus. Then lute on the cap\r\nwith fat lute, and allow it to dry for some days, and weigh the whole\r\naccurately; after this exhaust the balloon by means of an air-pump\r\nconnected with the tube xxx, and fill it with oxygen gas by the tube\r\nyyy, from the gazometer, Pl. VIII. Fig. 1. described Chap. II. Sect\r\nII. of this part. The phosphorus is then set on fire by means of a\r\nburning-glass, and is allowed to burn till the cloud of concrete\r\nphosphoric acid stops the combustion, oxygen gas being continually\r\nsupplied from the gazometer. When the apparatus has cooled, it is\r\nweighed and unluted; the tare of the instrument being allowed, the\r\nweight is that of the phosphoric acid contained. It is proper, for\r\ngreater accuracy, to examine the air or gas contained in the balloon\r\nafter combustion, as it may happen to be somewhat heavier or lighter\r\nthan common air; and this difference of weight must be taken into\r\naccount in the calculations upon the results of the experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\n_Of the Combustion of Charcoal._\r\n\r\nThe apparatus I have employed for this process consists of a small\r\nconical furnace of hammered copper, represented in perspective, Pl. XII.\r\nFig. 9. and internally displayed Fig. 11. It is divided into the\r\nfurnace, ABC, where the charcoal is burnt, the grate, d e, and the\r\nash-hole, F; the tube, GH, in the middle of the dome of the furnace\r\nserves to introduce the charcoal, and as a chimney for carrying off the\r\nair which has served for combustion. Through the tube, l m n, which\r\ncommunicates with the gazometer, the hydrogen gas, or air, intended for\r\nsupporting the combustion, is conveyed into the ash-hole, F, whence it\r\nis forced, by the application of pressure to the gazometer, to pass\r\nthrough the grate, d e, and to blow upon the burning charcoal placed\r\nimmediately above.\r\n\r\nOxygen gas, which forms 28/100 of atmospheric air, is changed into\r\ncarbonic acid gas during combustion with charcoal, whilst the azotic gas\r\nof the air is not altered at all. Hence, after the combustion of\r\ncharcoal in atmospheric air, a mixture of carbonic acid gas and azotic\r\ngas must remain; to allow this mixture to pass off, the tube, o p, is\r\nadapted to the chimney, GH, by means of a screw at G, and conveys the\r\ngas into bottles half filled with solution of caustic potash. The\r\ncarbonic acid gas is absorbed by the alkali, and the azotic gas is\r\nconveyed into a second gazometer, where its quantity is ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the furnace, ABC, is first accurately determined, then\r\nintroduce the tube RS, of known weight, by the chimney, GH, till its\r\nlower end S, rests upon the grate, d e, which it occupies entirely; in\r\nthe next place, fill the furnace with charcoal, and weigh the whole\r\nagain, to know the exact quantity of charcoal submitted to experiment.\r\nThe furnace is now put in its place, the tube, l m n, is screwed to\r\nthat which communicates with the gazometer, and the tube, o p, to that\r\nwhich communicates with the bottles of alkaline solution. Every thing\r\nbeing in readiness, the stop-cock of the gazometer is opened, a small\r\npiece of burning charcoal is thrown into the tube, RS, which is\r\ninstantly withdrawn, and the tube, o p, is screwed to the chimney, GH.\r\nThe little piece of charcoal falls upon the grate, and in this manner\r\ngets below the whole charcoal, and is kept on fire by the stream of air\r\nfrom the gazometer. To be certain that the combustion is begun, and goes\r\non properly, the tube, q r s, is fixed to the furnace, having a piece\r\nof glass cemented to its upper extremity, s, through which we can see\r\nif the charcoal be on fire.\r\n\r\nI neglected to observe above, that the furnace, and its appendages, are\r\nplunged in water in the cistern, TVXY, Fig. 11. Pl. XII. to which ice\r\nmay be added to moderate the heat, if necessary; though the heat is by\r\nno means very considerable, as there is no air but what comes from the\r\ngazometer, and no more of the charcoal burns at one time than what is\r\nimmediately over the grate.\r\n\r\nAs one piece of charcoal is consumed another falls down into its place,\r\nin consequence of the declivity of the sides of the furnace; this gets\r\ninto the stream of air from the grate, d e, and is burnt; and so on,\r\nsuccessively, till the whole charcoal is consumed. The air which has\r\nserved the purpose of the combustion passes through the mass of\r\ncharcoal, and is forced by the pressure of the gazometer to escape\r\nthrough the tube, o p, and to pass through the bottles of alkaline\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThis experiment furnishes all the necessary data for a complete analysis\r\nof atmospheric air and of charcoal. We know the weight of charcoal\r\nconsumed; the gazometer gives us the measure of the air employed; the\r\nquantity and quality of gas remaining after combustion may be\r\ndetermined, as it is received, either in another gazometer, or in jars,\r\nin a pneumato-chemical apparatus; the weight of ashes remaining in the\r\nash-hole is readily ascertained; and, finally, the additional weight\r\nacquired by the bottles of alkaline solution gives the exact quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid formed during the process. By this experiment we may\r\nlikewise determine, with sufficient accuracy, the proportions in which\r\ncharcoal and oxygen enter into the composition of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nIn a future memoir I shall give an account to the Academy of a series of\r\nexperiments I have undertaken, with this instrument, upon all the\r\nvegetable and animal charcoals. By some very slight alterations, this\r\nmachine may be made to answer for observing the principal phenomena of\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.\r\n\r\n_Of the Combustion of Oils._\r\n\r\nOils are more compound in their nature than charcoal, being formed by\r\nthe combination of at least two elements, charcoal and hydrogen; of\r\ncourse, after their combustion in common air, water, carbonic acid gas,\r\nand azotic gas, remain. Hence the apparatus employed for their\r\ncombustion requires to be adapted for collecting these three products,\r\nand is consequently more complicated than the charcoal furnace.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus I employ for this purpose is composed of a large jar or\r\npitcher A, Pl. XII. Fig. 4. surrounded at its upper edge by a rim of\r\niron properly cemented at DE, and receding from the jar at BC, so as to\r\nleave a furrow or gutter xx, between it and the outside of the jar,\r\nsomewhat more than two inches deep. The cover or lid of the jar, Fig. 5.\r\nis likewise surrounded by an iron rim f g, which adjusts into the\r\ngutter xx, Fig. 4. which being filled with mercury, has the effect of\r\nclosing the jar hermetically in an instant, without using any lute; and,\r\nas the gutter will hold about two inches of mercury, the air in the jar\r\nmay be made to sustain the pressure of more than two feet of water,\r\nwithout danger of its escaping.\r\n\r\nThe lid has four holes, T h i k, for the passage of an equal\r\nnumber of tubes. The opening T is furnished with a leather box, through\r\nwhich passes the rod, Fig. 3. intended for raising and lowering the wick\r\nof the lamp, as will be afterwards directed. The three other holes are\r\nintended for the passage of three several tubes, one of which conveys\r\nthe oil to the lamp, a second conveys air for keeping up the combustion,\r\nand the third carries off the air, after it has served for combustion.\r\nThe lamp in which the oil is burnt is represented Fig. 2; a is the\r\nreservoir of oil, having a funnel by which it is filled; b c d e f g h\r\nis a syphon which conveys the oil to the lamp 11; 7, 8, 9, 10, is the\r\ntube which conveys the air for combustion from the gazometer to the same\r\nlamp. The tube b c is formed externally, at its lower end b, into a\r\nmale screw, which turns in a female screw in the lid of the reservoir of\r\noil a; so that, by turning the reservoir one way or the other, it is\r\nmade to rise or fall, by which the oil is kept at the necessary level.\r\n\r\nWhen the syphon is to be filled, and the communication formed between\r\nthe reservoir of oil and the lamp, the stop-cock c is shut, and that\r\nat e opened, oil is poured in by the opening f at the top of the\r\nsyphon, till it rises within three or four lines of the upper edge of\r\nthe lamp, the stop-cock k is then shut, and that at c opened; the\r\noil is then poured in at f, till the branch b c d of the syphon is\r\nfilled, and then the stop-cock e is closed. The two branches of the\r\nsyphon being now completely filled, a communication is fully established\r\nbetween the reservoir and the lamp.\r\n\r\nIn Pl. XII. Fig. 1. all the parts of the lamp 11, Fig. 2. are\r\nrepresented magnified, to show them distinctly. The tube i k carries\r\nthe oil from the reservoir to the cavity a a a a, which contains the\r\nwick; the tube 9, 10, brings the air from the gazometer for keeping up\r\nthe combustion; this air spreads through the cavity d d d d, and, by\r\nmeans of the passages c c c c and b b b b, is distributed on each\r\nside of the wick, after the principles of the lamps constructed by\r\nArgand, Quinquet, and Lange.\r\n\r\nTo render the whole of this complicated apparatus more easily\r\nunderstood, and that its description may make all others of the same\r\nkind more readily followed, it is represented, completely connected\r\ntogether for use, in Pl. XI. The gazometer P furnishes air for the\r\ncombustion by the tube and stop-cock 1, 2; the tube 2, 3, communicates\r\nwith a second gazometer, which is filled whilst the first one is\r\nemptying during the process, that there may be no interruption to the\r\ncombustion; 4, 5, is a tube of glass filled with deliquescent salts, for\r\ndrying the air as much as possible in its passage; and the weight of\r\nthis tube and its contained salts, at the beginning of the experiment,\r\nbeing known, it is easy to determine the quantity of water absorbed by\r\nthem from the air. From this deliquescent tube the air is conducted\r\nthrough the pipe 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, to the lamp 11, where it spreads on\r\nboth sides of the wick, as before described, and feeds the flame. One\r\npart of this air, which serves to keep up the combustion of the oil,\r\nforms carbonic acid gas and water, by oxygenating its elements. Part of\r\nthis water condenses upon the sides of the pitcher A, and another part\r\nis held in solution in the air by means of caloric furnished by the\r\ncombustion. This air is forced by the compression of the gazometer to\r\npass through the tube 12, 13, 14, 15, into the bottle 16, and the worm\r\n17, 18, where the water is fully condensed from the refrigeration of the\r\nair; and, if any water still remains in solution, it is absorbed by\r\ndeliquescent salts contained in the tube 19, 20.\r\n\r\nAll these precautions are solely intended for collecting and determining\r\nthe quantity of water formed during the experiment; the carbonic acid\r\nand azotic gas remains to be ascertained. The former is absorbed by\r\ncaustic alkaline solution in the bottles 22 and 25. I have only\r\nrepresented two of these in the figure, but nine at least are requisite;\r\nand the last of the series may be half filled with lime-water, which is\r\nthe most certain reagent for indicating the presence of carbonic acid;\r\nif the lime-water is not rendered turbid, we may be certain that no\r\nsensible quantity of that acid remains in the air.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the air which has served for combustion, and which chiefly\r\nconsists of azotic gas, though still mixed with a considerable portion\r\nof oxygen gas, which has escaped unchanged from the combustion, is\r\ncarried through a third tube 28, 29, of deliquescent salts, to deprive\r\nit of any moisture it may have acquired in the bottles of alkaline\r\nsolution and lime-water, and from thence by the tube 29, 30, into a\r\ngazometer, where its quantity is ascertained. Small essays are then\r\ntaken from it, which are exposed to a solution of sulphuret of potash,\r\nto ascertain the proportions of oxygen and azotic gas it contains.\r\n\r\nIn the combustion of oils the wick becomes charred at last, and\r\nobstructs the rise of the oil; besides, if we raise the wick above a\r\ncertain height, more oil rises through its capillary tubes than the\r\nstream of air is capable of consuming, and smoke is produced. Hence it\r\nis necessary to be able to lengthen or shorten the wick without opening\r\nthe apparatus; this is accomplished by means of the rod 31, 32, 33, 34,\r\nwhich passes through a leather-box, and is connected with the support of\r\nthe wick; and that the motion of this rod, and consequently of the wick,\r\nmay be regulated with the utmost smoothness and facility; it is moved at\r\npleasure by a pinnion which plays in a toothed rack. The rod, with its\r\nappendages, are represented Pl. XII. Fig. 3. It appeared to me, that the\r\ncombustion would be assisted by surrounding the flame of the lamp with a\r\nsmall glass jar open at both ends, as represented in its place in Pl.\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter into a more detailed description of the construction\r\nof this apparatus, which is still capable of being altered and modified\r\nin many respects, but shall only add, that when it is to be used in\r\nexperiment, the lamp and reservoir with the contained oil must be\r\naccurately weighed, after which it is placed as before directed, and\r\nlighted; having then formed the connection between the air in the\r\ngazometer and the lamp, the external jar A, Pl. XI. is fixed over all,\r\nand secured by means of the board BC and two rods of iron which connect\r\nthis board with the lid, and are screwed to it. A small quantity of oil\r\nis burnt while the jar is adjusting to the lid, and the product of that\r\ncombustion is lost; there is likewise a small portion of air from the\r\ngazometer lost at the same time. Both of these are of very\r\ninconsiderable consequence in extensive experiments, and they are even\r\ncapable of being valued in our calculation of the results.\r\n\r\nIn a particular memoir, I shall give an account to the Academy of the\r\ndifficulties inseparable from this kind of experiments: These are so\r\ninsurmountable and troublesome, that I have not hitherto been able to\r\nobtain any rigorous determination of the quantities of the products. I\r\nhave sufficient proof, however, that the fixed oils are entirely\r\nresolved during combustion into water and carbonic acid gas, and\r\nconsequently that they are composed of hydrogen and charcoal; but I have\r\nno certain knowledge respecting the proportions of these ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.\r\n\r\n_Of the Combustion of Alkohol._\r\n\r\nThe combustion of alkohol may be very readily performed in the apparatus\r\nalready described for the combustion of charcoal and phosphorus. A lamp\r\nfilled with alkohol is placed under the jar A, Pl. IV. Fig. 3. a small\r\nmorsel of phosphorus is placed upon the wick of the lamp, which is set\r\non fire by means of the hot iron, as before directed. This process is,\r\nhowever, liable to considerable inconveniency; it is dangerous to make\r\nuse of oxygen gas at the beginning of the experiment for fear of\r\ndeflagration, which is even liable to happen when common air is\r\nemployed. An instance of this had very near proved fatal to myself, in\r\npresence of some members of the Academy. Instead of preparing the\r\nexperiment, as usual, at the time it was to be performed, I had disposed\r\nevery thing in order the evening before; the atmospheric air of the jar\r\nhad thereby sufficient time to dissolve a good deal of the alkohol; and\r\nthis evaporation had even been considerably promoted by the height of\r\nthe column of mercury, which I had raised to EF, Pl. IV. Fig. 3. The\r\nmoment I attempted to set the little morsel of phosphorus on fire by\r\nmeans of the red hot iron, a violent explosion took place, which threw\r\nthe jar with great violence against the floor of the laboratory, and\r\ndashed it in a thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nHence we can only operate upon very small quantities, such as ten or\r\ntwelve grains of alkohol, in this manner; and the errors which may be\r\ncommitted in experiments upon such small quantities prevents our placing\r\nany confidence in their results. I endeavoured to prolong the\r\ncombustion, in the experiments contained in the Memoirs of the Academy\r\nfor 1784, p. 593. by lighting the alkohol first in common air, and\r\nfurnishing oxygen gas afterwards to the jar, in proportion as it\r\nconsumed; but the carbonic acid gas produced by the process became a\r\ngreat hinderance to the combustion, the more so that alkohol is but\r\ndifficultly combustible, especially in worse than common air; so that\r\neven in this way very small quantities only could be burnt.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this combustion might succeed better in the oil apparatus, Pl.\r\nXI.; but I have not hitherto ventured to try it. The jar A in which the\r\ncombustion is performed is near 1400 cubical inches in dimension; and,\r\nwere an explosion to take place in such a vessel, its consequences would\r\nbe very terrible, and very difficult to guard against. I have not,\r\nhowever, despaired of making the attempt.\r\n\r\nFrom all these difficulties, I have been hitherto obliged to confine\r\nmyself to experiments upon very small quantities of alkohol, or at least\r\nto combustions made in open vessels, such as that represented in Pl. IX.\r\nFig. 5. which will be described in Section VII. of this chapter. If I am\r\never able to remove these difficulties, I shall resume this\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of the Combustion of Ether._\r\n\r\nTho' the combustion of ether in close vessels does not present the same\r\ndifficulties as that of alkohol, yet it involves some of a different\r\nkind, not more easily overcome, and which still prevent the progress of\r\nmy experiments. I endeavoured to profit by the property which ether\r\npossesses of dissolving in atmospheric air, and rendering it inflammable\r\nwithout explosion. For this purpose, I constructed the reservoir of\r\nether a b c d, Plate XII. Fig. 8. to which air is brought from the\r\ngazometer by the tube 1, 2, 3, 4. This air spreads, in the first place,\r\nin the double lid ac of the reservoir, from which it passes through\r\nseven tubes ef, gh, ik, &c. which descend to the bottom of the\r\nether, and it is forced by the pressure of the gazometer to boil up\r\nthrough the ether in the reservoir. We may replace the ether in this\r\nfirst reservoir, in proportion as it is dissolved and carried off by the\r\nair, by means of the supplementary reservoir E, connected by a brass\r\ntube fifteen or eighteen inches long, and shut by a stop-cock. This\r\nlength of the connecting tube is to enable the descending ether to\r\novercome the resistance occasioned by the pressure of the air from the\r\ngazometer.\r\n\r\nThe air, thus loaded with vapours of ether, is conducted by the tube 5,\r\n6, 7, 8, 9, to the jar A, into which it is allowed to escape through a\r\ncapillary opening, at the extremity of which it is set on fire. The air,\r\nwhen it has served the purpose of combustion, passes through the bottle\r\n16, Pl. XI. the worm 17, 18, and the deliquescent tube 19, 20, after\r\nwhich it passes through the alkaline bottles; in these its carbonic acid\r\ngas is absorbed, the water formed during the experiment having been\r\npreviously deposited in the former parts of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nWhen I caused construct this apparatus, I supposed that the combination\r\nof atmospheric air and ether formed in the reservoir a b c d, Pl. XII.\r\nFig. 8. was in proper proportion for supporting combustion; but in this\r\nI was mistaken; for there is a very considerable quantity of excess of\r\nether; so that an additional quantity of atmospheric air is necessary\r\nto enable it to burn fully. Hence a lamp constructed upon these\r\nprinciples will burn in common air, which furnishes the quantity of\r\noxygen necessary for combustion, but will not burn in close vessels in\r\nwhich the air is not renewed. From this circumstance, my ether lamp went\r\nout soon after being lighted and shut up in the jar A, Pl. XII. Fig. 8.\r\nTo remedy this defect, I endeavoured to bring atmospheric air to the\r\nlamp by the lateral tube 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, which I distributed\r\ncircularly round the flame; but the flame is so exceedingly rare, that\r\nit is blown out by the gentlest possible stream of air, so that I have\r\nnot hitherto succeeded in burning ether. I do not, however, despair of\r\nbeing able to accomplish it by means of some changes I am about to have\r\nmade upon this apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Combustion of Hydrogen Gas, and the Formation of Water._\r\n\r\nIn the formation of water, two substances, hydrogen and oxygen, which\r\nare both in the aëriform state before combustion, are transformed into\r\nliquid or water by the operation. This experiment would be very easy,\r\nand would require very simple instruments, if it were possible to\r\nprocure the two gasses perfectly pure, so that they might burn without\r\nany residuum. We might, in that case, operate in very small vessels,\r\nand, by continually furnishing the two gasses in proper proportions,\r\nmight continue the combustion indefinitely. But, hitherto, chemists have\r\nonly employed oxygen gas, mixed with azotic gas; from which\r\ncircumstance, they have only been able to keep up the combustion of\r\nhydrogen gas for a very limited time in close vessels, because, as the\r\nresiduum of azotic gas is continually increasing, the air becomes at\r\nlast so much contaminated, that the flame weakens and goes out. This\r\ninconvenience is so much the greater in proportion as the oxygen gas\r\nemployed is less pure. From this circumstance, we must either be\r\nsatisfied with operating upon small quantities, or must exhaust the\r\nvessels at intervals, to get rid of the residuum of azotic gas; but, in\r\nthis case, a portion of the water formed during the experiment is\r\nevaporated by the exhaustion; and the resulting error is the more\r\ndangerous to the accuracy of the process, that we have no certain means\r\nof valuing it.\r\n\r\nThese considerations make me desirous to repeat the principal\r\nexperiments of pneumatic chemistry with oxygen gas entirely free from\r\nany admixture of azotic gas; and this may be procured from oxygenated\r\nmuriat of potash. The oxygen gas extracted from this salt does not\r\nappear to contain azote, unless accidentally, so that, by proper\r\nprecautions, it may be obtained perfectly pure. In the mean time, the\r\napparatus employed by Mr Meusnier and me for the combustion of hydrogen\r\ngas, which is described in the experiment for recomposition of water,\r\nPart I. Chap. VIII. and need not be here repeated, will answer the\r\npurpose; when pure gasses are procured, this apparatus will require no\r\nalterations, except that the capacity of the vessels may then be\r\ndiminished. See Pl. IV. Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nThe combustion, when once begun, continues for a considerable time, but\r\nweakens gradually, in proportion as the quantity of azotic gas remaining\r\nfrom the combustion increases, till at last the azotic gas is in such\r\nover proportion that the combustion can no longer be supported, and the\r\nflame goes out. This spontaneous extinction must be prevented, because,\r\nas the hydrogen gas is pressed upon in its reservoir, by an inch and a\r\nhalf of water, whilst the oxygen gas suffers a pressure only of three\r\nlines, a mixture of the two would take place in the balloon, which would\r\nat last be forced by the superior pressure into the reservoir of oxygen\r\ngas. Wherefore the combustion must be stopped, by shutting the\r\nstop-cock of the tube dDd whenever the flame grows very feeble; for\r\nwhich purpose it must be attentively watched.\r\n\r\nThere is another apparatus for combustion, which, though we cannot with\r\nit perform experiments with the same scrupulous exactness as with the\r\npreceding instruments, gives very striking results that are extremely\r\nproper to be shewn in courses of philosophical chemistry. It consists of\r\na worm EF, Pl. IX. Fig. 5. contained in a metallic cooller ABCD. To the\r\nupper part of this worm E, the chimney GH is fixed, which is composed of\r\ntwo tubes, the inner of which is a continuation of the worm, and the\r\nouter one is a case of tin-plate, which surrounds it at about an inch\r\ndistance, and the interval is filled up with sand. At the inferior\r\nextremity K of the inner tube, a glass tube is fixed, to which we adopt\r\nthe Argand lamp LM for burning alkohol, &c.\r\n\r\nThings being thus disposed, and the lamp being filled with a determinate\r\nquantity of alkohol, it is set on fire; the water which is formed during\r\nthe combustion rises in the chimney KE, and being condensed in the worm,\r\nruns out at its extremity F into the bottle P. The double tube of the\r\nchimney, filled with sand in the interstice, is to prevent the tube from\r\ncooling in its upper part, and condensing the water; otherwise, it\r\nwould fall back in the tube, and we should not be able to ascertain its\r\nquantity, and besides it might fall in drops upon the wick, and\r\nextinguish the flame. The intention of this construction, is to keep the\r\nchimney always hot, and the worm always cool, that the water may be\r\npreserved in the state of vapour whilst rising, and may be condensed\r\nimmediately upon getting into the descending part of the apparatus. By\r\nthis instrument, which was contrived by Mr Meusnier, and which is\r\ndescribed by me in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1784, p. 593. we may,\r\nwith attention to keep the worm always cold, collect nearly seventeen\r\nounces of water from the combustion of sixteen ounces of alkohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Oxydation of Metals._\r\n\r\nThe term _oxydation_ or _calcination_ is chiefly used to signify the\r\nprocess by which metals exposed to a certain degree of heat are\r\nconverted into oxyds, by absorbing oxygen from the air. This combination\r\ntakes place in consequence of oxygen possessing a greater affinity to\r\nmetals, at a certain temperature, than to caloric, which becomes\r\ndisengaged in its free state; but, as this disengagement, when made in\r\ncommon air, is slow and progressive, it is scarcely evident to the\r\nsenses. It is quite otherwise, however, when oxydation takes place in\r\noxygen gas; for, being produced with much greater rapidity, it is\r\ngenerally accompanied with heat and light, so as evidently to show that\r\nmetallic substances are real combustible bodies.\r\n\r\nAll the metals have not the same degree of affinity to oxygen. Gold,\r\nsilver, and platina, for instance, are incapable of taking it away from\r\nits combination with caloric, even in the greatest known heat; whereas\r\nthe other metals absorb it in a larger or smaller quantity, until the\r\naffinities of the metal to oxygen, and of the latter to caloric, are in\r\nexact equilibrium. Indeed, this state of equilibrium of affinities may\r\nbe assumed as a general law of nature in all combinations.\r\n\r\nIn all operations of this nature, the oxydation of metals is accelerated\r\nby giving free access to the air; it is sometimes much assisted by\r\njoining the action of a bellows, which directs a stream of air over the\r\nsurface of the metal. This process becomes greatly more rapid if a\r\nstream of oxygen gas be used, which is readily done by means of the\r\ngazometer formerly described. The metal, in this case, throws out a\r\nbrilliant flame, and the oxydation is very quickly accomplished; but\r\nthis method can only be used in very confined experiments, on account of\r\nthe expence of procuring oxygen gas. In the essay of ores, and in all\r\nthe common operations of the laboratory, the calcination or oxydation of\r\nmetals is usually performed in a dish of baked clay, Pl. IV. Fig. 6.\r\ncommonly called a _roasting test_, placed in a strong furnace. The\r\nsubstances to be oxydated are frequently stirred, on purpose to present\r\nfresh surfaces to the air.\r\n\r\nWhenever this operation is performed upon a metal which is not volatile,\r\nand from which nothing flies off into the surrounding air during the\r\nprocess, the metal acquires additional weight; but the cause of this\r\nincreased weight during oxydation could never have been discovered by\r\nmeans of experiments performed in free air; and it is only since these\r\noperations have been performed in close vessels, and in determinate\r\nquantities of air, that any just conjectures have been formed concerning\r\nthe cause of this phenomenon. The first method for this purpose is due\r\nto Dr Priestley, who exposes the metal to be calcined in a porcelain cup\r\nN, Pl. IV. Fig. 11. placed upon the stand IK, under a jar A, in the\r\nbason BCDE, full of water; the water is made to rise up to GH, by\r\nsucking out the air with a syphon, and the focus of a burning glass is\r\nmade to fall upon the metal. In a few minutes the oxydation takes\r\nplace, a part of the oxygen contained in the air combines with the\r\nmetal, and a proportional diminution of the volume of air is produced;\r\nwhat remains is nothing more than azotic gas, still however mixed with a\r\nsmall quantity of oxygen gas. I have given an account of a series of\r\nexperiments made with this apparatus in my Physical and Chemical Essays,\r\nfirst published in 1773. Mercury may be used instead of water in this\r\nexperiment, whereby the results are rendered still more conclusive.\r\n\r\nAnother process for this purpose was invented by Mr Boyle, and of which\r\nI gave an account in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1774, p. 351. The\r\nmetal is introduced into a retort, Pl. III. Fig. 20. the beak of which\r\nis hermetically sealed; the metal is then oxydated by means of heat\r\napplied with great precaution. The weight of the vessel, and its\r\ncontained substances, is not at all changed by this process, until the\r\nextremity of the neck of the retort is broken; but, when that is done,\r\nthe external air rushes in with a hissing noise. This operation is\r\nattended with danger, unless a part of the air is driven out of the\r\nretort, by means of heat, before it is hermetically sealed, as otherwise\r\nthe retort would be apt to burst by the dilation of the air when placed\r\nin the furnace. The quantity of air driven out may be received under a\r\njar in the pneumato-chemical apparatus, by which its quantity, and that\r\nof the air remaining in the retort, is ascertained. I have not\r\nmultiplied my experiments upon oxydation of metals so much as I could\r\nhave wished; neither have I obtained satisfactory results with any metal\r\nexcept tin. It is much to be wished that some person would undertake a\r\nseries of experiments upon oxydation of metals in the several gasses;\r\nthe subject is important, and would fully repay any trouble which this\r\nkind of experiment might occasion.\r\n\r\nAs all the oxyds of mercury are capable of revivifying without addition,\r\nand restore the oxygen gas they had before absorbed, this seemed to be\r\nthe most proper metal for becoming the subject of conclusive experiments\r\nupon oxydation. I formerly endeavoured to accomplish the oxydation of\r\nmercury in close vessels, by filling a retort, containing a small\r\nquantity of mercury, with oxygen gas, and adapting a bladder half full\r\nof the same gas to its beak; See Pl. IV. Fig. 12. Afterwards, by heating\r\nthe mercury in the retort for a very long time, I succeeded in oxydating\r\na very small portion, so as to form a little red oxyd floating upon the\r\nsurface of the running mercury; but the quantity was so small, that the\r\nsmallest error committed in the determination of the quantities of\r\noxygen gas before and after the operation must have thrown very great\r\nuncertainty upon the results of the experiment. I was, besides,\r\ndissatisfied with this process, and not without cause, lest any air\r\nmight have escaped through the pores of the bladder, more especially as\r\nit becomes shrivelled by the heat of the furnace, unless covered over\r\nwith cloths kept constantly wet.\r\n\r\nThis experiment is performed with more certainty in the apparatus\r\ndescribed in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1775, p. 580. This consists\r\nof a retort, A, Pl. IV. Fig. 2. having a crooked glass tube BCDE of ten\r\nor twelve lines internal diameter, melted on to its beak, and which is\r\nengaged under the bell glass FG, standing with its mouth downwards, in a\r\nbason filled with water or mercury. The retort is placed upon the bars\r\nof the furnace MMNN, Pl. IV. Fig. 2. or in a sand bath, and by means of\r\nthis apparatus we may, in the course of several days, oxydate a small\r\nquantity of mercury in common air; the red oxyd floats upon the surface,\r\nfrom which it may be collected and revivified, so as to compare the\r\nquantity of oxygen gas obtained in revivification with the absorption\r\nwhich took place during oxydation. This kind of experiment can only be\r\nperformed upon a small scale, so that no very certain conclusions can be\r\ndrawn from them[61].\r\n\r\nThe combustion of iron in oxygen gas being a true oxydation of that\r\nmetal, ought to be mentioned in this place. The apparatus employed by Mr\r\nIngenhousz for this operation is represented in Pl. IV. Fig. 17.; but,\r\nhaving already described it sufficiently in Chap. III. I shall refer the\r\nreader to what is said of it in that place. Iron may likewise be\r\noxydated by combustion in vessels filled with oxygen gas, in the way\r\nalready directed for phosphorus and charcoal. This apparatus is\r\nrepresented Pl. IV. Fig. 3. and described in the fifth chapter of the\r\nfirst part of this work. We learn from Mr Ingenhousz, that all the\r\nmetals, except gold, silver, and mercury, may be burnt or oxydated in\r\nthe same manner, by reducing them into very fine wire, or very thin\r\nplates cut into narrow slips; these are twisted round with iron-wire,\r\nwhich communicates the property of burning to the other metals.\r\n\r\nMercury is even difficultly oxydated in free air. In chemical\r\nlaboratories, this process is usually carried on in a matrass A, Pl. IV.\r\nFig. having a very flat body, and a very long neck BC, which vessel is\r\ncommonly called _Boyle's bell_. A quantity of mercury is introduced\r\nsufficient to cover the bottom, and it is placed in a sand-bath, which\r\nkeeps up a constant heat approaching to that of boiling mercury. By\r\ncontinuing this operation with five or six similar matrasses during\r\nseveral months, and renewing the mercury from time to time, a few\r\nounces of red oxyd are at last obtained. The great slowness and\r\ninconvenience of this apparatus arises from the air not being\r\nsufficiently renewed; but if, on the other hand, too free a circulation\r\nwere given to the external air, it would carry off the mercury in\r\nsolution in the state of vapour, so that in a few days none would remain\r\nin the vessel.\r\n\r\nAs, of all the experiments upon the oxydation of metals, those with\r\nmercury are the most conclusive, it were much to be wished that a simple\r\napparatus could be contrived by which this oxydation and its results\r\nmight be demonstrated in public courses of chemistry. This might, in my\r\nopinion, be accomplished by methods similar to those I have already\r\ndescribed for the combustion of charcoal and the oils; but, from other\r\npursuits, I have not been able hitherto to resume this kind of\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe oxyd of mercury revives without addition, by being heated to a\r\nslightly red heat. In this degree of temperature, oxygen has greater\r\naffinity to caloric than to mercury, and forms oxygen gas. This is\r\nalways mixed with a small portion of azotic gas, which indicates that\r\nthe mercury absorbs a small portion of this latter gas during oxydation.\r\nIt almost always contains a little carbonic acid gas, which must\r\nundoubtedly be attributed to the foulnesses of the oxyd; these are\r\ncharred by the heat, and convert a part of the oxygen gas into carbonic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nIf chemists were reduced to the necessity of procuring all the oxygen\r\ngas employed in their experiments from mercury oxydated by heat without\r\naddition, or, as it is called, _calcined_ or _precipitated_ per se, the\r\nexcessive dearness of that preparation would render experiments, even\r\nupon a moderate scale, quite impracticable. But mercury may likewise be\r\noxydated by means of nitric acid; and in this way we procure a red oxyd,\r\neven more pure than that produced by calcination. I have sometimes\r\nprepared this oxyd by dissolving mercury in nitric acid, evaporating to\r\ndryness, and calcining the salt, either in a retort, or in capsules\r\nformed of pieces of broken matrasses and retorts, in the manner formerly\r\ndescribed; but I have never succeeded in making it equally beautiful\r\nwith what is sold by the druggists, and which is, I believe, brought\r\nfrom Holland. In choosing this, we ought to prefer what is in solid\r\nlumps composed of soft adhering scales, as when in powder it is\r\nsometimes adulterated with red oxyd of lead.\r\n\r\nTo obtain oxygen gas from the red oxyd of mercury, I usually employ a\r\nporcelain retort, having a long glass tube adapted to its beak, which is\r\nengaged under jars in the water pneumato-chemical apparatus, and I\r\nplace a bottle in the water, at the end of the tube, for receiving the\r\nmercury, in proportion as it revives and distils over. As the oxygen gas\r\nnever appears till the retort becomes red, it seems to prove the\r\nprinciple established by Mr Berthollet, that an obscure heat can never\r\nform oxygen gas, and that light is one of its constituent elements. We\r\nmust reject the first portion of gas which comes over, as being mixed\r\nwith common air, from what was contained in the retort at the beginning\r\nof the experiment; but, even with this precaution, the oxygen gas\r\nprocured is usually contaminated with a tenth part of azotic gas, and\r\nwith a very small portion of carbonic acid gas. This latter is readily\r\ngot rid of, by making the gas pass through a solution of caustic alkali;\r\nbut we know of no method for separating the azotic gas; its proportions\r\nmay however be ascertained, by leaving a known quantity of the oxygen\r\ngas contaminated with it for a fortnight, in contact with sulphuret of\r\nsoda or potash, which absorbs the oxygen gas so as to convert the\r\nsulphur into sulphuric acid, and leaves the azotic gas remaining pure.\r\n\r\nWe may likewise procure oxygen gas from black oxyd of manganese or\r\nnitrat of potash, by exposing them to a red heat in the apparatus\r\nalready described for operating upon red oxyd of mercury; only, as it\r\nrequires such a heat as is at least capable of softening glass, we must\r\nemploy retorts of stone or of porcelain. But the purest and best oxygen\r\ngas is what is disengaged from oxygenated muriat of potash by simple\r\nheat. This operation is performed in a glass retort, and the gas\r\nobtained is perfectly pure, provided that the first portions, which are\r\nmixed with the common air of the vessels, be rejected.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] See an account of this experiment, Part. I. Chap. iii.--A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n_Of Deflagration._\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already shown, Part I. Chap. IX. that oxygen does not always part\r\nwith the whole of the caloric it contained in the state of gas when it\r\nenters into combination with other bodies. It carries almost the whole\r\nof its caloric alongst with it in entering into the combinations which\r\nform nitric acid and oxygenated muriatic acid; so that in nitrats, and\r\nmore especially in oxygenated muriats, the oxygen is, in a certain\r\ndegree, in the state of oxygen gas, condensed, and reduced to the\r\nsmallest volume it is capable of occupying.\r\n\r\nIn these combinations, the caloric exerts a constant action upon the\r\noxygen to bring it back to the state of gas; hence the oxygen adheres\r\nbut very slightly, and the smallest additional force is capable of\r\nsetting it free; and, when such force is applied, it often recovers the\r\nstate of gas instantaneously. This rapid passage from the solid to the\r\naëriform state is called detonation, or fulmination, because it is\r\nusually accompanied with noise and explosion. Deflagrations are commonly\r\nproduced by means of combinations of charcoal either with nitre or\r\noxygenated muriat of potash; sometimes, to assist the inflammation,\r\nsulphur is added; and, upon the just proportion of these ingredients,\r\nand the proper manipulation of the mixture, depends the art of making\r\ngun-powder.\r\n\r\nAs oxygen is changed, by deflagration with charcoal, into carbonic acid,\r\ninstead of oxygen gas, carbonic acid gas is disengaged, at least when\r\nthe mixture has been made in just proportions. In deflagration with\r\nnitre, azotic gas is likewise disengaged, because azote is one of the\r\nconstituent elements of nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe sudden and instantaneous disengagement and expansion of these gasses\r\nis not, however, sufficient for explaining all the phenomena of\r\ndeflagration; because, if this were the sole operating power, gun powder\r\nwould always be so much the stronger in proportion as the quantity of\r\ngas disengaged in a given time was the more considerable, which does not\r\nalways accord with experiment. I have tried some kinds which produced\r\nalmost double the effect of ordinary gun powder, although they gave out\r\na sixth part less of gas during deflagration. It would appear that the\r\nquantity of caloric disengaged at the moment of detonation contributes\r\nconsiderably to the expansive effects produced; for, although caloric\r\npenetrates freely through the pores of every body in nature, it can only\r\ndo so progressively, and in a given time; hence, when the quantity\r\ndisengaged at once is too large to get through the pores of the\r\nsurrounding bodies, it must necessarily act in the same way with\r\nordinary elastic fluids, and overturn every thing that opposes its\r\npassage. This must, at least in part, take place when gun-powder is set\r\non fire in a cannon; as, although the metal is permeable to caloric, the\r\nquantity disengaged at once is too large to find its way through the\r\npores of the metal, it must therefore make an effort to escape on every\r\nside; and, as the resistance all around, excepting towards the muzzle,\r\nis too great to be overcome, this effort is employed for expelling the\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\nThe caloric produces a second effect, by means of the repulsive force\r\nexerted between its particles; it causes the gasses, disengaged at the\r\nmoment of deflagration, to expand with a degree of force proportioned to\r\nthe temperature produced.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that water is decomposed during the deflagration of\r\ngun-powder, and that part of the oxygen furnished to the nascent\r\ncarbonic acid gas is produced from it. If so, a considerable quantity of\r\nhydrogen gas must be disengaged in the instant of deflagration, which\r\nexpands, and contributes to the force of the explosion. It may readily\r\nbe conceived how greatly this circumstance must increase the effect of\r\npowder, if we consider that a pint of hydrogen gas weighs only one\r\ngrain and two thirds; hence a very small quantity in weight must occupy\r\na very large space, and it must exert a prodigious expansive force in\r\npassing from the liquid to the aëriform state of existence.\r\n\r\nIn the last place, as a portion of undecomposed water is reduced to\r\nvapour during the deflagration of gun-powder, and as water, in the state\r\nof gas, occupies seventeen or eighteen hundred times more space than in\r\nits liquid state, this circumstance must likewise contribute largely to\r\nthe explosive force of the powder.\r\n\r\nI have already made a considerable series of experiments upon the nature\r\nof the elastic fluids disengaged during the deflagration of nitre with\r\ncharcoal and sulphur; and have made some, likewise, with the oxygenated\r\nmuriat of potash. This method of investigation leads to tollerably\r\naccurate conclusions with respect to the constituent elements of these\r\nsalts. Some of the principal results of these experiments, and of the\r\nconsequences drawn from them respecting the analysis of nitric acid, are\r\nreported in the collection of memoirs presented to the Academy by\r\nforeign philosophers, vol. xi. p. 625. Since then I have procured more\r\nconvenient instruments, and I intend to repeat these experiments upon a\r\nlarger scale, by which I shall procure more accurate precision in their\r\nresults; the following, however, is the process I have hitherto\r\nemployed. I would very earnestly advise such as intend to repeat some of\r\nthese experiments, to be very much upon their guard in operating upon\r\nany mixture which contains nitre, charcoal, and sulphur, and more\r\nespecially with those in which oxygenated muriat of potash is mixed with\r\nthese two materials.\r\n\r\nI make use of pistol barrels, about six inches long, and of five or six\r\nlines diameter, having the touch-hole spiked up with an iron nail\r\nstrongly driven in, and broken in the hole, and a little tin-smith's\r\nsolder run in to prevent any possible issue for the air. These are\r\ncharged with a mixture of known quantities of nitre and charcoal, or any\r\nother mixture capable of deflagration, reduced to an impalpable powder,\r\nand formed into a paste with a moderate quantity of water. Every portion\r\nof the materials introduced must be rammed down with a rammer nearly of\r\nthe same caliber with the barrel, four or five lines at the muzzle must\r\nbe left empty, and about two inches of quick match are added at the end\r\nof the charge. The only difficulty in this experiment, especially when\r\nsulphur is contained in the mixture, is to discover the proper degree of\r\nmoistening; for, if the paste be too much wetted, it will not take fire,\r\nand if too dry, the deflagration is apt to become too rapid, and even\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nWhen the experiment is not intended to be rigorously exact, we set fire\r\nto the match, and, when it is just about to communicate with the charge,\r\nwe plunge the pistol below a large bell-glass full of water, in the\r\npneumato chemical apparatus. The deflagration begins, and continues in\r\nthe water, and gas is disengaged with less or more rapidity, in\r\nproportion as the mixture is more or less dry. So long as the\r\ndeflagration continues, the muzzle of the pistol must be kept somewhat\r\ninclined downwards, to prevent the water from getting into its barrel.\r\nIn this manner I have sometimes collected the gas produced from the\r\ndeflagration of an ounce and half, or two ounces, of nitre.\r\n\r\nIn this manner of operating it is impossible to determine the quantity\r\nof carbonic acid gas disengaged, because a part of it is absorbed by the\r\nwater while passing through it; but, when the carbonic acid is absorbed,\r\nthe azotic gas remains; and, if it be agitated for a few minutes in\r\ncaustic alkaline solution, we obtain it pure, and can easily determine\r\nits volume and weight. We may even, in this way, acquire a tollerably\r\nexact knowledge of the quantity of carbonic acid by repeating the\r\nexperiment a great many times, and varying the proportions of charcoal,\r\ntill we find the exact quantity requisite to deflagrate the whole nitre\r\nemployed. Hence, by means of the weight of charcoal employed, we\r\ndetermine the weight of oxygen necessary for saturation, and deduce the\r\nquantity of oxygen contained in a given weight of nitre.\r\n\r\nI have used another process, by which the results of this experiment are\r\nconsiderably more accurate, which consists in receiving the disengaged\r\ngasses in bell-glasses filled with mercury. The mercurial apparatus I\r\nemploy is large enough to contain jars of from twelve to fifteen pints\r\nin capacity, which are not very readily managed when full of mercury,\r\nand even require to be filled by a particular method. When the jar is\r\nplaced in the cistern of mercury, a glass syphon is introduced,\r\nconnected with a small air-pump, by means of which the air is exhausted,\r\nand the mercury rises so as to fill the jar. After this, the gas of the\r\ndeflagration is made to pass into the jar in the same manner as directed\r\nwhen water is employed.\r\n\r\nI must again repeat, that this species of experiment requires to be\r\nperformed with the greatest possible precautions. I have sometimes seen,\r\nwhen the disengagement of gas proceeded with too great rapidity, jars\r\nfilled with more than an hundred and fifty pounds of mercury driven off\r\nby the force of the explosion, and broken to pieces, while the mercury\r\nwas scattered about in great quantities.\r\n\r\nWhen the experiment has succeeded, and the gas is collected under the\r\njar, its quantity in general, and the nature and quantities of the\r\nseveral species of gasses of which the mixture is composed, are\r\naccurately ascertained by the methods already pointed out in the second\r\nchapter of this part of my work. I have been prevented from putting the\r\nlast hand to the experiments I had begun upon deflagration, from their\r\nconnection with the objects I am at present engaged in; and I am in\r\nhopes they will throw considerable light upon the operations belonging\r\nto the manufacture of gun-powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n_Of the Instruments necessary for Operating upon Bodies in very high\r\nTemperatures._\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n_Of Fusion._\r\n\r\nWe have already seen, that, by aqueous solution, in which the particles\r\nof bodies are separated from each other, neither the solvent nor the\r\nbody held in solution are at all decomposed; so that, whenever the cause\r\nof separation ceases, the particles reunite, and the saline substance\r\nrecovers precisely the same appearance and properties it possessed\r\nbefore solution. Real solutions are produced by fire, or by introducing\r\nand accumulating a great quantity of caloric between the particles of\r\nbodies; and this species of solution in caloric is usually called\r\n_fusion_.\r\n\r\nThis operation is commonly performed in vessels called crucibles, which\r\nmust necessarily be less fusible than the bodies they are intended to\r\ncontain. Hence, in all ages, chemists have been extremely solicitous to\r\nprocure crucibles of very refractory materials, or such as are capable\r\nof resisting a very high degree of heat. The best are made of very pure\r\nclay or of porcelain earth; whereas such as are made of clay mixed with\r\ncalcareous or silicious earth are very fusible. All the crucibles made\r\nin the neighbourhood of Paris are of this kind, and consequently unfit\r\nfor most chemical experiments. The Hessian crucibles are tolerably good;\r\nbut the best are made of Limoges earth, which seems absolutely\r\ninfusible. We have, in France, a great many clays very fit for making\r\ncrucibles; such, for instance, is the kind used for making melting pots\r\nat the glass-manufactory of St Gobin.\r\n\r\nCrucibles are made of various forms, according to the operations they\r\nare intended to perform. Several of the most common kinds are\r\nrepresented Pl. VII. Fig. 7. 8. 9. and 10. the one represented at Fig.\r\n9. is almost shut at its mouth.\r\n\r\nThough fusion may often take place without changing the nature of the\r\nfused body, this operation is frequently employed as a chemical means of\r\ndecomposing and recompounding bodies. In this way all the metals are\r\nextracted from their ores; and, by this process, they are revivified,\r\nmoulded, and alloyed with each other. By this process sand and alkali\r\nare combined to form glass, and by it likewise pastes, or coloured\r\nstones, enamels, &c. are formed.\r\n\r\nThe action of violent fire was much more frequently employed by the\r\nancient chemists than it is in modern experiments. Since greater\r\nprecision has been employed in philosophical researches, the _humid_ has\r\nbeen preferred to the _dry_ method of process, and fusion is seldom had\r\nrecourse to until all the other means of analysis have failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n_Of Furnaces._\r\n\r\nThese are instruments of most universal use in chemistry; and, as the\r\nsuccess of a great number of experiments depends upon their being well\r\nor ill constructed, it is of great importance that a laboratory be well\r\nprovided in this respect. A furnace is a kind of hollow cylindrical\r\ntower, sometimes widened above, Pl. XIII. Fig. 1. ABCD, which must have\r\nat least two lateral openings; one in its upper part F, which is the\r\ndoor of the fire-place, and one below, G, leading to the ash-hole.\r\nBetween these the furnace is divided by a horizontal grate, intended\r\nfor supporting the fewel, the situation of which is marked in the figure\r\nby the line HI. Though this be the least complicated of all the chemical\r\nfurnaces, yet it is applicable to a great number of purposes. By it\r\nlead, tin, bismuth, and, in general, every substance which does not\r\nrequire a very strong fire, may be melted in crucibles; it will serve\r\nfor metallic oxydations, for evaporatory vessels, and for sand-baths, as\r\nin Pl. III. Fig. 1. and 2. To render it proper for these purposes,\r\nseveral notches, m m m m, Pl. XIII. Fig. 1. are made in its upper\r\nedge, as otherwise any pan which might be placed over the fire would\r\nstop the passage of the air, and prevent the fewel from burning. This\r\nfurnace can only produce a moderate degree of heat, because the quantity\r\nof charcoal it is capable of consuming is limited by the quantity of air\r\nwhich is allowed to pass through the opening G of the ash-hole. Its\r\npower might be considerably augmented by enlarging this opening, but\r\nthen the great stream of air which is convenient for some operations\r\nmight be hurtful in others; wherefore we must have furnaces of different\r\nforms, constructed for different purposes, in our laboratories: There\r\nought especially to be several of the kind now described of different\r\nsizes.\r\n\r\nThe reverberatory furnace, Pl. XIII. Fig. 2. is perhaps more necessary.\r\nThis, like the common furnace, is composed of the ash-hole HIKL, the\r\nfire-place KLMN, the laboratory MNOP, and the dome RRSS, with its funnel\r\nor chimney TTVV; and to this last several additional tubes may be\r\nadapted, according to the nature of the different experiments. The\r\nretort A is placed in the division called the laboratory, and supported\r\nby two bars of iron which run across the furnace, and its beak comes out\r\nat a round hole in the side of the furnace, one half of which is cut in\r\nthe piece called the laboratory, and the other in the dome. In most of\r\nthe ready made reverberatory furnaces which are sold by the potters at\r\nParis, the openings both above and below are too small: These do not\r\nallow a sufficient volume of air to pass through; hence, as the quantity\r\nof charcoal consumed, or, what is much the same thing, the quantity of\r\ncaloric disengaged, is nearly in proportion to the quantity of air which\r\npasses through the furnace, these furnaces do not produce a sufficient\r\neffect in a great number of experiments. To remedy this defect, there\r\nought to be two openings GG to the ash-hole; one of these is shut up\r\nwhen only a moderate fire is required; and both are kept open when the\r\nstrongest power of the furnace is to be exerted. The opening of the dome\r\nSS ought likewise to be considerably larger than is usually made.\r\n\r\nIt is of great importance not to employ retorts of too large size in\r\nproportion to the furnace, as a sufficient space ought always to be\r\nallowed for the passage of the air between the sides of the furnace and\r\nthe vessel. The retort A in the figure is too small for the size of the\r\nfurnace, yet I find it more easy to point out the error than to correct\r\nit. The intention of the dome is to oblige the flame and heat to\r\nsurround and strike back or reverberate upon every part of the retort,\r\nwhence the furnace gets the name of reverberatory. Without this\r\ncircumstance the retort would only be heated in its bottom, the vapours\r\nraised from the contained substance would condense in the upper part,\r\nand a continual cohabitation would take place without any thing passing\r\nover into the receiver, but, by means of the dome, the retort is equally\r\nheated in every part, and the vapours being forced out, can only\r\ncondense in the neck of the retort, or in the recipient.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the bottom of the retort from being either heated or coolled\r\ntoo suddenly, it is sometimes placed in a small sand-bath of baked clay,\r\nstanding upon the cross bars of the furnace. Likewise, in many\r\noperations, the retorts are coated over with lutes, some of which are\r\nintended to preserve them from the too sudden influence of heat or of\r\ncold, while others are for sustaining the glass, or forming a kind of\r\nsecond retort, which supports the glass one during operations wherein\r\nthe strength of the fire might soften it. The former is made of\r\nbrick-clay with a little cow's hair beat up alongst with it, into a\r\npaste or mortar, and spread over the glass or stone retorts. The latter\r\nis made of pure clay and pounded stone-ware mixed together, and used in\r\nthe same manner. This dries and hardens by the fire, so as to form a\r\ntrue supplementary retort capable of retaining the materials, if the\r\nglass retort below should crack or soften. But, in experiments which are\r\nintended for collecting gasses, this lute, being porous, is of no manner\r\nof use.\r\n\r\nIn a great many experiments wherein very violent fire is not required,\r\nthe reverberatory furnace may be used as a melting one, by leaving out\r\nthe piece called the laboratory, and placing the dome immediately upon\r\nthe fire-place, as represented Pl. XIII. Fig. 3. The furnace represented\r\nin Fig. 4. is very convenient for fusions; it is composed of the\r\nfire-place and ash-hole ABD, without a door, and having a hole E, which\r\nreceives the muzzle of a pair of bellows strongly luted on, and the dome\r\nABGH, which ought to be rather lower than is represented in the figure.\r\nThis furnace is not capable of producing a very strong heat, but is\r\nsufficient for ordinary operations, and may be readily moved to any part\r\nof the laboratory where it is wanted. Though these particular furnaces\r\nare very convenient, every laboratory must be provided with a forge\r\nfurnace, having a good pair of bellows, or, what is more necessary, a\r\npowerful melting furnace. I shall describe the one I use, with the\r\nprinciples upon which it is constructed.\r\n\r\nThe air circulates in a furnace in consequence of being heated in its\r\npassage through the burning coals; it dilates, and, becoming lighter\r\nthan the surrounding air, is forced to rise upwards by the pressure of\r\nthe lateral columns of air, and is replaced by fresh air from all sides,\r\nespecially from below. This circulation of air even takes place when\r\ncoals are burnt in a common chaffing dish; but we can readily conceive,\r\nthat, in a furnace open on all sides, the mass of air which passes, all\r\nother circumstances being equal, cannot be so great as when it is\r\nobliged to pass through a furnace in the shape of a hollow tower, like\r\nmost of the chemical furnaces, and consequently, that the combustion\r\nmust be more rapid in a furnace of this latter construction. Suppose,\r\nfor instance, the furnace ABCDEF open above, and filled with burning\r\ncoals, the force with which the air passes through the coals will be in\r\nproportion to the difference between the specific gravity of two columns\r\nequal to AC, the one of cold air without, and the other of heated air\r\nwithin the furnace. There must be some heated air above the opening AB,\r\nand the superior levity of this ought likewise to be taken into\r\nconsideration; but, as this portion is continually coolled and carried\r\noff by the external air, it cannot produce any great effect.\r\n\r\nBut, if we add to this furnace a large hollow tube GHAB of the same\r\ndiameter, which preserves the air which has been heated by the burning\r\ncoals from being coolled and dispersed by the surrounding air, the\r\ndifference of specific gravity which causes the circulation will then be\r\nbetween two columns equal to GC. Hence, if GC be three times the length\r\nof AC, the circulation will have treble force. This is upon the\r\nsupposition that the air in GHCD is as much heated as what is contained\r\nin ABCD, which is not strictly the case, because the heat must decrease\r\nbetween AB and GH; but, as the air in GHAB is much warmer than the\r\nexternal air, it follows, that the addition of the tube must increase\r\nthe rapidity of the stream of air, that a larger quantity must pass\r\nthrough the coals, and consequently that a greater degree of combustion\r\nmust take place.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, conclude from these principles, that the length of\r\nthis tube ought to be indefinitely prolonged; for, since the heat of the\r\nair gradually diminishes in passing from AB to GH, even from the contact\r\nof the sides of the tube, if the tube were prolonged to a certain\r\ndegree, we would at last come to a point where the specific gravity of\r\nthe included air would be equal to the air without; and, in this case,\r\nas the cool air would no longer tend to rise upwards, it would become a\r\ngravitating mass, resisting the ascension of the air below. Besides, as\r\nthis air, which has served for combustion, is necessarily mixed with\r\ncarbonic acid gas, which is considerably heavier than common air, if the\r\ntube were made long enough, the air might at last approach so near to\r\nthe temperature of the external air as even to gravitate downwards;\r\nhence we must conclude, that the length of the tube added to a furnace\r\nmust have some limit beyond which it weakens, instead of strengthening\r\nthe force of the fire.\r\n\r\nFrom these reflections it follows, that the first foot of tube added to\r\na furnace produces more effect than the sixth, and the sixth more than\r\nthe tenth; but we have no data to ascertain at what height we ought to\r\nstop. This limit of useful addition is so much the farther in proportion\r\nas the materials of the tube are weaker conductors of heat, because the\r\nair will thereby be so much less coolled; hence baked earth is much to\r\nbe preferred to plate iron. It would be even of consequence to make the\r\ntube double, and to fill the interval with rammed charcoal, which is one\r\nof the worst conductors of heat known; by this the refrigeration of the\r\nair will be retarded, and the rapidity of the stream of air consequently\r\nincreased; and, by this means, the tube may be made so much the longer.\r\n\r\nAs the fire-place is the hottest part of a furnace, and the part where\r\nthe air is most dilated in its passage, this part ought to be made with\r\na considerable widening or belly. This is the more necessary, as it is\r\nintended to contain the charcoal and crucible, as well as for the\r\npassage of the air which supports, or rather produces the combustion;\r\nhence we only allow the interstices between the coals for the passage of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nFrom these principles my melting furnace is constructed, which I believe\r\nis at least equal in power to any hitherto made, though I by no means\r\npretend that it possesses the greatest possible intensity that can be\r\nproduced in chemical furnaces. The augmentation of the volume of air\r\nproduced during its passage through a melting furnace not being hitherto\r\nascertained from experiment, we are still unacquainted with the\r\nproportions which should exist between the inferior and superior\r\napertures, and the absolute size of which these openings should be made\r\nis still less understood; hence data are wanting by which to proceed\r\nupon principle, and we can only accomplish the end in view by repeated\r\ntrials.\r\n\r\nThis furnace, which, according to the above stated rules, is in form of\r\nan eliptical spheroid, is represented Pl. XIII. Fig. 6. ABCD; it is cut\r\noff at the two ends by two plains, which pass, perpendicular to the\r\naxis, through the foci of the elipse. From this shape it is capable of\r\ncontaining a considerable quantity of charcoal, while it leaves\r\nsufficient space in the intervals for the passage of the air. That no\r\nobstacle may oppose the free access of external air, it is perfectly\r\nopen below, after the model of Mr Macquer's melting furnace, and stands\r\nupon an iron tripod. The grate is made of flat bars set on edge, and\r\nwith considerable interstices. To the upper part is added a chimney, or\r\ntube, of baked earth, ABFG, about eighteen feet long, and almost half\r\nthe diameter of the furnace. Though this furnace produces a greater heat\r\nthan any hitherto employed by chemists, it is still susceptible of being\r\nconsiderably increased in power by the means already mentioned, the\r\nprincipal of which is to render the tube as bad a conductor of heat as\r\npossible, by making it double, and filling the interval with rammed\r\ncharcoal.\r\n\r\nWhen it is required to know if lead contains any mixture of gold or\r\nsilver, it is heated in a strong fire in capsules of calcined bones,\r\nwhich are called cuppels. The lead is oxydated, becomes vitrified, and\r\nsinks into the substance of the cuppel, while the gold or silver, being\r\nincapable of oxydation, remain pure. As lead will not oxydate without\r\nfree access of air, this operation cannot be performed in a crucible\r\nplaced in the middle of the burning coals of a furnace, because the\r\ninternal air, being mostly already reduced by the combustion into azotic\r\nand carbonic acid gas, is no longer fit for the oxydation of metals. It\r\nwas therefore necessary to contrive a particular apparatus, in which the\r\nmetal should be at the same time exposed to the influence of violent\r\nheat, and defended from contact with air rendered incombustible by its\r\npassage through burning coals. The furnace intended for answering this\r\ndouble purpose is called the cuppelling or essay furnace. It is usually\r\nmade of a square form, as represented Pl. XIII. Fig. 8. and 10. having\r\nan ash-hole AABB, a fire-place BBCC, a laboratory CCDD, and a dome DDEE.\r\nThe muffle or small oven of baked earth GH, Fig. 9. being placed in the\r\nlaboratory of the furnace upon cross bars of iron, is adjusted to the\r\nopening GG, and luted with clay softened in water. The cuppels are\r\nplaced in this oven or muffle, and charcoal is conveyed into the furnace\r\nthrough the openings of the dome and fire-place. The external air enters\r\nthrough the openings of the ash-hole for supporting the combustion, and\r\nescapes by the superior opening or chimney at EE; and air is admitted\r\nthrough the door of the muffle GG for oxydating the contained metal.\r\n\r\nVery little reflection is sufficient to discover the erroneous\r\nprinciples upon which this furnace is constructed. When the opening GG\r\nis shut, the oxydation is produced slowly, and with difficulty, for want\r\nof air to carry it on; and, when this hole is open, the stream of cold\r\nair which is then admitted fixes the metal, and obstructs the process.\r\nThese inconveniencies may be easily remedied, by constructing the muffle\r\nand furnace in such a manner that a stream of fresh external air should\r\nalways play upon the surface of the metal, and this air should be made\r\nto pass through a pipe of clay kept continually red hot by the fire of\r\nthe furnace. By this means the inside of the muffle will never be\r\ncoolled, and processes will be finished in a few minutes, which at\r\npresent require a considerable space of time.\r\n\r\nMr Sage remedies these inconveniencies in a different manner; he places\r\nthe cuppel containing lead, alloyed with gold or silver, amongst the\r\ncharcoal of an ordinary furnace, and covered by a small porcelain\r\nmuffle; when the whole is sufficiently heated, he directs the blast of a\r\ncommon pair of hand-bellows upon the surface of the metal, and completes\r\nthe cuppellation in this way with great ease and exactness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\n_Of increasing the Action of Fire, by using Oxygen Gas instead of\r\nAtmospheric Air._\r\n\r\nBy means of large burning glasses, such as those of Tchirnausen and Mr\r\nde Trudaine, a degree of heat is obtained somewhat greater than has\r\nhitherto been produced in chemical furnaces, or even in the ovens of\r\nfurnaces used for baking hard porcelain. But these instruments are\r\nextremely expensive, and do not even produce heat sufficient to melt\r\ncrude platina; so that their advantages are by no means sufficient to\r\ncompensate for the difficulty of procuring, and even of using them.\r\nConcave mirrors produce somewhat more effect than burning glasses of the\r\nsame diameter, as is proved by the experiments of Messrs Macquer and\r\nBeaumé with the speculum of the Abbé Bouriot; but, as the direction of\r\nthe reflected rays is necessarily from below upwards, the substance to\r\nbe operated upon must be placed in the air without any support, which\r\nrenders most chemical experiments impossible to be performed with this\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I first endeavoured to employ oxygen gas for\r\ncombustion, by filling large bladders with it, and making it pass\r\nthrough a tube capable of being shut by a stop-cock; and in this way I\r\nsucceeded in causing it to support the combustion of lighted charcoal.\r\nThe intensity of the heat produced, even in my first attempt, was so\r\ngreat as readily to melt a small quantity of crude platina. To the\r\nsuccess of this attempt is owing the idea of the gazometer, described p.\r\n308. _et seq._ which I substituted instead of the bladders; and, as we\r\ncan give the oxygen gas any necessary degree of pressure, we can with\r\nthis instrument keep up a continued stream, and give it even a very\r\nconsiderable force.\r\n\r\nThe only apparatus necessary for experiments of this kind consists of a\r\nsmall table ABCD, Pl. XII. Fig. 15, with a hole F, through which passes\r\na tube of copper or silver, ending in a very small opening at G, and\r\ncapable of being opened or shut by the stop-cock H. This tube is\r\ncontinued below the table at l m n o, and is connected with the\r\ninterior cavity of the gazometer. When we mean to operate, a hole of a\r\nfew lines deep must be made with a chizel in a piece of charcoal, into\r\nwhich the substance to be treated is laid; the charcoal is set on fire\r\nby means of a candle and blow-pipe, after which it is exposed to a\r\nrapid stream of oxygen gas from the extremity G of the tube FG.\r\n\r\nThis manner of operating can only be used with such bodies as can be\r\nplaced, without inconvenience, in contact with charcoal, such as metals,\r\nsimple earths, &c. But, for bodies whose elements have affinity to\r\ncharcoal, and which are consequently decomposed by that substance, such\r\nas sulphats, phosphats, and most of the neutral salts, metallic glasses,\r\nenamels, &c. we must use a lamp, and make the stream of oxygen gas pass\r\nthrough its flame. For this purpose, we use the elbowed blow-pipe ST,\r\ninstead of the bent one FG, employed with charcoal. The heat produced in\r\nthis second manner is by no means so intense as in the former way, and\r\nis very difficultly made to melt platina. In this manner of operating\r\nwith the lamp, the substances are placed in cuppels of calcined bones,\r\nor little cups of porcelain, or even in metallic dishes. If these last\r\nare sufficiently large, they do not melt, because, metals being good\r\nconductors of heat, the caloric spreads rapidly through the whole mass,\r\nso that none of its parts are very much heated.\r\n\r\nIn the Memoirs of the Academy for 1782, p. 476. and for 1783, p. 573.\r\nthe series of experiments I have made with this apparatus may be seen at\r\nlarge. The following are some of the principal results.\r\n\r\n1. Rock cristal, or pure silicious earth, is infusible, but becomes\r\ncapable of being softened or fused when mixed with other substances.\r\n\r\n2. Lime, magnesia, and barytes, are infusible, either when alone, or\r\nwhen combined together; but, especially lime, they assist the fusion of\r\nevery other body.\r\n\r\n3. Argill, or pure base of alum, is completely fusible _per se_ into a\r\nvery hard opake vitreous substance, which scratches glass like the\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\n4. All the compound earths and stones are readily fused into a brownish\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n5. All the saline substances, even fixed alkali, are volatilized in a\r\nfew seconds.\r\n\r\n6. Gold, silver, and probably platina, are slowly volatilized without\r\nany particular phenomenon.\r\n\r\n7. All other metallic substances, except mercury, become oxydated,\r\nthough placed upon charcoal, and burn with different coloured flames,\r\nand at last dissipate altogether.\r\n\r\n8. The metallic oxyds likewise all burn with flames. This seems to form\r\na distinctive character for these substances, and even leads me to\r\nbelieve, as was suspected by Bergman, that barytes is a metallic oxyd,\r\nthough we have not hitherto been able to obtain the metal in its pure or\r\nreguline state.\r\n\r\n9. Some of the precious stones, as rubies, are capable of being softened\r\nand soldered together, without injuring their colour, or even\r\ndiminishing their weights. The hyacinth, tho' almost equally fixed with\r\nthe ruby, loses its colour very readily. The Saxon and Brasilian topaz,\r\nand the Brasilian ruby, lose their colour very quickly, and lose about a\r\nfifth of their weight, leaving a white earth, resembling white quartz,\r\nor unglazed china. The emerald, chrysolite, and garnet, are almost\r\ninstantly melted into an opake and coloured glass.\r\n\r\n10. The diamond presents a property peculiar to itself; it burns in the\r\nsame manner with combustible bodies, and is entirely dissipated.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another manner of employing oxygen gas for considerably\r\nincreasing the force of fire, by using it to blow a furnace. Mr Achard\r\nfirst conceived this idea; but the process he employed, by which he\r\nthought to dephlogisticate, as it is called, atmospheric air, or to\r\ndeprive it of azotic gas, is absolutely unsatisfactory. I propose to\r\nconstruct a very simple furnace, for this purpose, of very refractory\r\nearth, similar to the one represented Pl. XIII. Fig. 4. but smaller in\r\nall its dimensions. It is to have two openings, as at E, through one of\r\nwhich the nozle of a pair of bellows is to pass, by which the heat is to\r\nbe raised as high as possible with common air; after which, the stream\r\nof common air from the bellows being suddenly stopt, oxygen gas is to be\r\nadmitted by a tube, at the other opening, communicating with a gazometer\r\nhaving the pressure of four or five inches of water. I can in this\r\nmanner unite the oxygen gas from several gazometers, so as to make eight\r\nor nine cubical feet of gas pass through the furnace; and in this way I\r\nexpect to produce a heat greatly more intense than any hitherto known.\r\nThe upper orifice of the furnace must be carefully made of considerable\r\ndimensions, that the caloric produced may have free issue, lest the too\r\nsudden expansion of that highly elastic fluid should produce a dangerous\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\nTABLE _for Converting Lines, or Twelfth Parts of an Inch, and Fractions\r\nof Lines, into Decimal Fractions of the Inch._\r\n\r\nTwelfth Parts  Decimal                  Decimal\r\nof a Line.

ADDITIONAL.\r\n\r\nRULES _for Calculating the Absolute Gravity in English Troy Weight of a\r\nCubic Foot and Inch, English Measure, of any Substance whose Specific\r\nGravity is known[64]._\r\n\r\nIn 1696, Mr Everard, balance-maker to the Exchequer, weighed before the\r\nCommissioners of the House of Commons 2145.6 cubical inches, by the\r\nExchequer standard foot, of distilled water, at the temperature of 55°\r\nof Fahrenheit, and found it to weigh 1131 oz. 14 dts. Troy, of the\r\nExchequer standard. The beam turned with 6 grs. when loaded with 30\r\npounds in each scale. Hence, supposing the pound averdupois to weigh\r\n7000 grs. Troy, a cubic foot of water weighs 62-1/2 pounds averdupois,\r\nor 1000 ounces averdupois, wanting 106 grains Troy. And hence, if the\r\nspecific gravity of water be called 1000, the proportional specific\r\ngravities of all other bodies will nearly express the number of\r\naverdupois ounces in a cubic foot. Or more accurately, supposing the\r\nspecific gravity of water expressed by 1. and of all other bodies in\r\nproportional numbers, as the cubic foot of water weighs, at the above\r\ntemperature, exactly 437489.4 grains Troy, and the cubic inch of water\r\n253.175 grains, the absolute weight of a cubical foot or inch of any\r\nbody in Troy grains may be found by multiplying their specific gravity\r\nby either of the above numbers respectively.\r\n\r\nBy Everard's experiment, and the proportions of the English and French\r\nfoot, as established by the Royal Society and French Academy of\r\nSciences, the following numbers are ascertained.\r\n\r\nParis grains in a Paris cube foot of water            = 645511\r\n\r\nEnglish grains in a Paris cube foot of water          = 529922\r\n\r\nParis grains in an English cube foot of water         = 533247\r\n\r\nEnglish grains in an English cube foot of water       = 437489.4\r\n\r\nEnglish grains in an English cube inch of water       = 253.175\r\n\r\nBy an experiment of Picard with the measure and\r\n  weight of the Chatelet, the Paris cube foot of\r\n  water contains of Paris grains                      = 641326\r\n\r\nBy one of Du Hamel, made with great care              = 641376\r\n\r\nBy Homberg                                            = 641666\r\n\r\nThese show some uncertainty in measures or in weights; but the above\r\ncomputation from Everard's experiment may be relied on, because the\r\ncomparison of the foot of England with that of France was made by the\r\njoint labours of the Royal Society of London and the French Academy of\r\nSciences: It agrees likewise very nearly with the weight assigned by Mr\r\nLavoisier, 70 Paris pounds to the cubical foot of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. IX.\r\n\r\nTABLES _for Converting Ounces, Drams, and Grains, Troy, into Decimals of\r\nthe Troy Pound of 12 Ounces, and for Converting Decimals of the Pound\r\nTroy into Ounces, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _For Grains._\r\n\r\nGrains = Pound.\r\n\r\n   1  .0001736\r\n   2  .0003472\r\n   3  .0005208\r\n   4  .0006944\r\n   5  .0008681\r\n   6  .0010417\r\n   7  .0012153\r\n   8  .0013889\r\n   9  .0015625\r\n  10  .0017361\r\n\r\n  20  .0034722\r\n  30  .0052083\r\n  40  .0069444\r\n  50  .0086806\r\n  60  .0104167\r\n  70  .0121528\r\n  80  .0138889\r\n  90  .0156250\r\n\r\n 100  .0173611\r\n 200  .0374222\r\n 300  .0520833\r\n 400  .0694444\r\n 500  .0868055\r\n 600  .1041666\r\n 700  .1215277\r\n 800  .1388888\r\n 900  .1562499\r\n1000  .1736110\r\n\r\n2000  .3472220\r\n3000  .5208330\r\n4000  .6944440\r\n5000  .8680550\r\n6000 1.0418660\r\n7000 1.2152770\r\n8000 1.3888880\r\n9000 1.5624990\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _For Drams._\r\n\r\nDrams = Pound.\r\n\r\n1   .0104167\r\n2   .0208333\r\n3   .0312500\r\n4   .0416667\r\n5   .0520833\r\n6   .0625000\r\n7   .0729167\r\n8   .0833333\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _For Ounces._\r\n\r\nOunces = Pounds.\r\n\r\n 1    .0833333\r\n 2    .1666667\r\n 3    .2500000\r\n 4    .3333333\r\n 5    .4166667\r\n 6    .5000000\r\n 7    .5833333\r\n 8    .6666667\r\n 9    .7500000\r\n10    .8333333\r\n11    .9166667\r\n12   1.0000000\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _Decimals of the Pound into Ounces, &c._\r\n\r\n_Tenth parts._\r\n\r\nlib. =  oz. dr. gr.\r\n\r\n0.1     1   1   36\r\n0.2     2   3   12\r\n0.3     3   4   48\r\n0.4     4   6   24\r\n0.5     6   0    0\r\n0.6     7   1   36\r\n0.7     8   3   12\r\n0.8     9   4   48\r\n0.9    10   6   24\r\n\r\n_Hundredth parts._\r\n\r\n0.01    0   0   57.6\r\n0.02    0   1   55.2\r\n0.03    0   2   52.8\r\n0.04    0   3   50.4\r\n0.05    0   4   48.0\r\n0.06    0   5   45.6\r\n0.07    0   6   43.2\r\n0.08    0   7   40.8\r\n0.09    0   3   38.4\r\n\r\n_Thousandths._\r\n\r\n0.001   0   0    5.76\r\n0.002   0   0   11.52\r\n0.003   0   0   17.28\r\n0.004   0   0   23.04\r\n0.005   0   0   28.80\r\n\r\nlib. =          grs.\r\n\r\n0.006           34.56\r\n0.007           40.32\r\n0.008           46.08\r\n0.009           51.84\r\n\r\n_Ten thousandth parts._\r\n\r\n0.0001           0.576\r\n0.0002           1.152\r\n0.0003           1.728\r\n0.0004           2.304\r\n0.0005           2.880\r\n0.0006           3.456\r\n0.0007           4.032\r\n0.0008           4.608\r\n0.0009           5.184\r\n\r\n_Hundred thousandth parts._\r\n\r\n0.00001          0.052\r\n0.00002          0.115\r\n0.00003          0.173\r\n0.00004          0.230\r\n0.00005          0.288\r\n0.00006          0.346\r\n0.00007          0.403\r\n0.00008          0.461\r\n0.00009          0.518\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. X.\r\n\r\nTABLE _of the English Cubical Inches and Decimals corresponding to a\r\ndeterminate Troy Weight of Distilled Water at the Temperature of 55°,\r\ncalculated from Everard's experiment._\r\n\r\n_For Grains._\r\n\r\nGrs.
