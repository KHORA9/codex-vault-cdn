The valuable discoveries made in the science within a few\r\nyears have suggested an additional Letter, which is accordingly annexed\r\nto the series in the present revised form, giving a brief but\r\ncomprehensive notice of all the leading contributions with which\r\nAstronomy has of late been enriched.\r\n\r\nThe form of _Letters_ was chosen on account of the greater freedom it\r\nadmits, both of matter and of style, than a dress more purely\r\nscientific. Thus the technical portion of the work, it was hoped, might\r\nbe relieved, and the whole rendered attractive to the youthful reader of\r\neither sex by interspersing sketches of the master-builders who, in\r\nsuccessive ages, have reared the great temple of Astronomy, composing,\r\nas they do, some of the most remarkable and interesting specimens of the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\nThe work was addressed to a female friend (now no more), who was a\r\ndistinguished ornament of her sex, and whose superior intellect and\r\nrefined taste required that the work should be free from every thing\r\nsuperficial in matter or negligent in style; and it was deemed by the\r\nwriter no ordinary privilege that, in the composition of the work, an\r\nimage at once so exalted and so pure was continually present to his\r\nmental vision.\r\n\r\n    YALE COLLEGE, _January_, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PREFACE,

Virgil_\r\n\r\nTO MRS. C---- M----.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,--In the conversation we recently held on the study of\r\nAstronomy, you expressed a strong desire to become better acquainted\r\nwith this noble science, but said you had always been repelled by the\r\nair of severity which it exhibits, arrayed as it is in so many technical\r\nterms, and such abstruse mathematical processes: or, if you had taken up\r\nsome smaller treatise, with the hope of avoiding these perplexities, you\r\nhad always found it so meager and superficial, as to afford you very\r\nlittle satisfaction. You asked, if a work might not be prepared, which\r\nwould convey to the general reader some clear and adequate knowledge of\r\nthe great discoveries in astronomy, and yet require for its perusal no\r\ngreater preparation, than may be presumed of every well-educated English\r\nscholar of either sex.\r\n\r\nYou were pleased to add the request, that I would write such a work,--a\r\nwork which should combine, with a luminous exposition of the leading\r\ntruths of the science, some account of the interesting historical facts\r\nwith which it is said the records of astronomical discovery abound.\r\nHaving, moreover, heard much of the grand discoveries which, within the\r\nlast fifty years, have been made among the _fixed stars_, you expressed\r\na strong desire to learn more respecting these sublime researches.\r\nFinally, you desired to see the argument for the existence and natural\r\nattributes of the Deity, as furnished by astronomy, more fully and\r\nclearly exhibited, than is done in any work which you have hitherto\r\nperused. In the preparation of the proposed treatise, you urged me to\r\nsupply, either in the text or in notes, every _elementary principle_\r\nwhich would be essential to a perfect understanding of the work; for\r\nalthough, while at school, you had paid some attention to geometry and\r\nnatural philosophy, yet so much time had since elapsed, that your memory\r\nrequired to be refreshed on the most simple principles of these\r\nelementary studies, and you preferred that I should consider you as\r\naltogether unacquainted with them.\r\n\r\nAlthough, to satisfy a mind, so cultivated and inquisitive as yours, may\r\nrequire a greater variety of powers and attainments than I possess, yet,\r\nas you were pleased to urge me to the trial, I have resolved to make the\r\nattempt, and will see how far I may be able to lead you into the\r\ninterior of this beautiful temple, without obliging you to force your\r\nway through the \"jargon of the schools.\"\r\n\r\nAstronomy, however, is a very difficult or a comparatively easy study,\r\naccording to the view we take of it. The investigation of the great laws\r\nwhich govern the motions of the heavenly bodies has commanded the\r\nhighest efforts of the human mind; but profound truths, which it\r\nrequired the mightiest efforts of the intellect to disclose, are often,\r\nwhen once discovered, simple in their complexion, and may be expressed\r\nin very simple terms. Thus, the creation of that element, on whose\r\nmysterious agency depend all the forms of beauty and loveliness, is\r\nenunciated in these few monosyllables, \"And God said, let there be\r\nlight, and there was light;\" and the doctrine of universal gravitation,\r\nwhich is the key that unlocks the mysteries of the universe, is simply\r\nthis,--that every portion of matter in the universe tends towards every\r\nother. The three great laws of motion, also, are, when stated, so plain,\r\nthat they seem hardly to assert any thing but what we knew before. That\r\nall bodies, if at rest, will continue so, as is declared by the first\r\nlaw of motion, until some force moves them; or, if in motion, will\r\ncontinue so, until some force stops them, appears so much a matter of\r\ncourse, that we can at first hardly see any good reason why it should be\r\ndignified with the title of the first great law of motion; and yet it\r\ncontains a truth which it required profound sagacity to discover and\r\nexpound.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, a pleasing consideration to those who have not either\r\nthe leisure of the ability to follow the astronomer through the\r\nintricate and laborious processes, which conducted him to his great\r\ndiscoveries, that they may fully avail themselves of the _results_ of\r\nthis vast toil, and easily understand truths which it required ages of\r\nthe severest labor to unfold. The descriptive parts of astronomy, or\r\nwhat may be called the natural history of the heavens, is still more\r\neasily understood than the laws of the celestial motions. The\r\nrevelations of the telescope, and the wonders it has disclosed in the\r\nsun, in the moon, in the planets, and especially in the fixed stars, are\r\nfacts not difficult to be understood, although they may affect the mind\r\nwith astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe great practical purpose of astronomy to the world is, enabling us\r\nsafely to navigate the ocean. There are indeed many other benefits which\r\nit confers on man; but this is the most important. If, however, you ask,\r\nwhat advantages the study of astronomy promises, as a branch of\r\neducation, I answer, that few subjects promise to the mind so much\r\nprofit and entertainment. It is agreed by writers on the human mind,\r\nthat the intellectual powers are enlarged and strengthened by the\r\nhabitual contemplation of great objects, while they are contracted and\r\nweakened by being constantly employed upon little or trifling subjects.\r\nThe former elevate, the latter depress, the mind, to their own level.\r\nNow, every thing in astronomy is great. The magnitudes, distances, and\r\nmotions, of the heavenly bodies; the amplitude of the firmament itself;\r\nand the magnificence of the orbs with which it is lighted, supply\r\nexhaustless materials for contemplation, and stimulate the mind to its\r\nnoblest efforts. The emotion felt by the astronomer is not that sudden\r\nexcitement or ecstasy, which wears out life, but it is a continued glow\r\nof exalted feeling, which gives the sensation of breathing in a purer\r\natmosphere than others enjoy. We should at first imagine, that a study\r\nwhich calls upon its votaries for the severest efforts of the human\r\nintellect, which demands the undivided toil of years, and which robs the\r\nnight of its accustomed hours of repose, would abridge the period of\r\nlife; but it is a singular fact, that distinguished astronomers, as a\r\nclass, have been remarkable for longevity. I know not how to account for\r\nthis fact, unless we suppose that the study of astronomy itself has\r\nsomething inherent in it, which sustains its votaries by a peculiar\r\naliment.\r\n\r\nIt is the privilege of the student of this department of Nature, that\r\nhis cabinet is already collected, and is ever before him; and he is\r\nexempted from the toil of collecting his materials of study and\r\nillustration, by traversing land and sea, or by penetrating into the\r\ndepths of the earth. Nor are they in their nature frail and perishable.\r\nNo sooner is the veil of clouds removed, that occasionally conceals the\r\nfirmament by night, than his specimens are displayed to view, bright and\r\nchangeless. The renewed pleasure which he feels, at every new survey of\r\nthe constellations, grows into an affection for objects which have so\r\noften ministered to his happiness. His imagination aids him in giving\r\nthem a personification, like that which the ancients gave to the\r\nconstellations; (as is evident from the names which they have\r\ntransmitted to us;) and he walks abroad, beneath the evening canopy,\r\nwith the conscious satisfaction and delight of being in the presence of\r\nold friends. This emotion becomes stronger when he wanders far from\r\nhome. Other objects of his attachment desert him; the face of society\r\nchanges; the earth presents new features; but the same sun illumines the\r\nday, the same moon adorns the night, and the same bright stars still\r\nattend him.\r\n\r\nWhen, moreover, the student of the heavens can command the aid of\r\ntelescopes, of higher and higher powers, new acquaintances are made\r\nevery evening. The sight of each new member of the starry train, that\r\nthe telescope successively reveals to him, inspires a peculiar emotion\r\nof pleasure; and he at length finds himself, whenever he sweeps his\r\ntelescope over the firmament, greeted by smiles, unperceived and unknown\r\nto his fellow-mortals. The same personification is given to these\r\nobjects as to the constellations, and he seems to himself, at times,\r\nwhen he has penetrated into the remotest depths of ether, to enjoy the\r\nhigh prerogative of holding converse with the celestials.\r\n\r\nIt is no small encouragement, to one who wishes to acquire a knowledge\r\nof the heavens, that the subject is embarrassed with far less that is\r\ntechnical than most other branches of natural history. Having first\r\nlearned a few definitions, and the principal circles into which, for\r\nconvenience, the sphere is divided, and receiving the great laws of\r\nastronomy on the authority of the eminent persons who have investigated\r\nthem, you will find few hard terms, or technical distinctions, to repel\r\nor perplex you; and you will, I hope, find that nothing but an\r\nintelligent mind and fixed attention are requisite for perusing the\r\nLetters which I propose to address to you. I shall indeed be greatly\r\ndisappointed, if the perusal does not inspire you with some portion of\r\nthat pleasure, which I have described as enjoyed by the astronomer\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe dignity of the study of the heavenly bodies, and its suitableness to\r\nthe most refined and cultivated mind, has been recognised in all ages.\r\nVirgil celebrates it in the beautiful strains with which I have headed\r\nthis Letter, and similar sentiments have ever been cherished by the\r\ngreatest minds.\r\n\r\nAs, in the course of these Letters, I propose to trace an outline of the\r\nhistory of astronomy, from the earliest ages to the present time, you\r\nmay think this the most suitable place for introducing it; but the\r\nsuccessive discoveries in the science cannot be fully understood and\r\nappreciated, until after an acquaintance has been formed with the\r\nscience itself. We must therefore reserve the details of this subject\r\nfor a future opportunity; but it may be stated, here, that astronomy was\r\ncultivated the earliest of all the sciences; that great attention was\r\npaid to it by several very ancient nations, as the Egyptians and\r\nChaldeans, and the people of India and China, before it took its rise in\r\nGreece. More than six hundred years before the Christian era, however,\r\nit began to be studied in this latter country. Thales and Pythagoras\r\nwere particularly distinguished for their devotion to this science; and\r\nthe celebrated school of Alexandria, in Egypt, which took its rise about\r\nthree hundred years before the Christian era, and flourished for several\r\nhundred years, numbered among its disciples a succession of eminent\r\nastronomers, among whom were Hipparchus, Eratosthenes, and Ptolemy. The\r\nlast of these composed a great work on astronomy, called the 'Almagest,'\r\nin which is transmitted to us an account of all that was known of the\r\nscience by the Alexandrian school. The 'Almagest' was the principal\r\ntext-book in astronomy, for many centuries afterwards, and comparatively\r\nfew improvements were made until the age of Copernicus. Copernicus was\r\nborn at Thorn, in Prussia, in 1473. Previous to his time, the doctrine\r\nwas held, that the earth is at rest in the centre of the universe, and\r\nthat the sun, moon, and stars, revolve about it, every day, from east to\r\nwest; in short, that the _apparent_ motions of the heavenly bodies are\r\nthe same with their _real_ motions. But Copernicus expounded what is now\r\nknown to be the true theory of the celestial motions, in which the sun\r\nis placed in the centre of the solar system, and the earth and all the\r\nplanets are made to revolve around him, from west to east, while the\r\napparent diurnal motion of the heavenly bodies, from east to west, is\r\nexplained by the revolution of the earth on its axis, in the same time,\r\nfrom west to east; a motion of which we are unconscious, and which we\r\nerroneously ascribe to external objects, as we imagine the shore is\r\nreceding from us, when we are unconscious of the motion of the ship that\r\ncarries us from it.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the appearances, presented by the motions of the\r\nheavenly bodies, may be explained on the former erroneous hypothesis,\r\nyet, like other hypotheses founded in error, it was continually leading\r\nits votaries into difficulties, and blinding their minds to the\r\nperception of truth. They had advanced nearly as far as it was\r\npracticable to go in the wrong road; and the great and sublime\r\ndiscoveries of modern times are owing, in no small degree, to the fact,\r\nthat, since the days of Copernicus, astronomers have been pursuing the\r\nplain and simple path of truth, instead of threading their way through\r\nthe mazes of error.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the sixteenth century, Tycho Brahe, a native of\r\nSweden, but a resident of Denmark, carried astronomical observations\r\n(which constitute the basis of all that is valuable in astronomy) to a\r\nfar greater degree of perfection than had ever been done before. Kepler,\r\na native of Germany, one of the greatest geniuses the world has ever\r\nseen, was contemporary with Tycho Brahe, and was associated with him in\r\na part of his labors. Galileo, an Italian astronomer of great eminence,\r\nflourished only a little later than Tycho Brahe. He invented the\r\ntelescope, and, both by his discoveries and reasonings, contributed\r\ngreatly to establish the true system of the world. Soon after the\r\ncommencement of the seventeenth century, (1620,) Lord Bacon, a\r\ncelebrated English philosopher, pointed out the true method of\r\nconducting all inquiries into the phenomena of Nature, and introduced\r\nthe _inductive method of philosophizing_. According to the inductive\r\nmethod, we are to begin our inquiries into the causes of any events by\r\nfirst examining and classifying all the _facts_ that relate to it, and,\r\nfrom the comparison of these, to deduce our conclusions.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest single discovery, that has ever been made in astronomy,\r\nwas the law of universal gravitation, a discovery made by Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, in the latter part of the seventeenth century. The discovery of\r\nthis law made us acquainted with the hidden forces that move the great\r\nmachinery of the universe. It furnished the key which unlocks the inner\r\ntemple of Nature; and from this time we may regard astronomy as fixed on\r\na sure and immovable basis. I shall hereafter endeavor to explain to you\r\nthe leading principles of universal gravitation, when we come to the\r\nproper place for inquiring into the causes of the celestial motions, as\r\nexemplified in the motion of the earth around the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\nDOCTRINE OF THE SPHERE.\r\n\r\n    \"All are but parts of one stupendous whole,\r\n    Whose body Nature is, and God the soul.\"--_Pope._\r\n\r\n\r\nLET us now consider what astronomy is, and into what great divisions it\r\nis distributed; and then we will take a cursory view of the doctrine of\r\nthe sphere. This subject will probably be less interesting to you than\r\nmany that are to follow; but still, permit me to urge upon you the\r\nnecessity of studying it with attention, and reflecting upon each\r\ndefinition, until you fully understand it; for, unless you fully and\r\nclearly comprehend the circles of the sphere, and the use that is made\r\nof them in astronomy, a mist will hang over every subsequent portion of\r\nthe science. I beg you, therefore, to pause upon every paragraph of this\r\nLetter; and if there is any point in the whole which you cannot clearly\r\nunderstand, I would advise you to mark it, and to recur to it\r\nrepeatedly; and, if you finally cannot obtain a clear idea of it\r\nyourself, I would recommend to you to apply for aid to some of your\r\nfriends, who may be able to assist you.\r\n\r\n_Astronomy is that science which treats of the heavenly bodies._ More\r\nparticularly, its object is to teach what is known respecting the sun,\r\nmoon, planets, comets, and fixed stars; and also to explain the methods\r\nby which this knowledge is acquired. Astronomy is sometimes divided into\r\ndescriptive, physical, and practical. Descriptive astronomy respects\r\n_facts_; physical astronomy, _causes_; practical astronomy, the _means\r\nof investigating the facts_, whether by instruments or by calculation.\r\nIt is the province of descriptive astronomy to observe, classify, and\r\nrecord, all the phenomena of the heavenly bodies, whether pertaining to\r\nthose bodies individually, or resulting from their motions and mutual\r\nrelations. It is the part of physical astronomy to explain the causes of\r\nthese phenomena, by investigating the general laws on which they depend;\r\nespecially, by tracing out all the consequences of the law of universal\r\ngravitation. Practical astronomy lends its aid to both the other\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nThe definitions of the different lines, points, and circles, which are\r\nused in astronomy, and the propositions founded upon them, compose the\r\n_doctrine of the sphere_. Before these definitions are given, I must\r\nrecall to your recollection a few particulars respecting the method of\r\nmeasuring angles. (See Fig. 1, page 18.)\r\n\r\nA line drawn from the centre to the circumference of a circle is called\r\na _radius_, as C D, C B, or C K.\r\n\r\nAny part of the circumference of a circle is called an _arc_, as A B, or\r\nB D.\r\n\r\nAn angle is measured by an arc included between two radii. Thus, in\r\nFig. 1, the angle contained between the two radii, C A and C B, that is,\r\nthe angle A C B, is measured by the arc A B. Every circle, it will be\r\nrecollected, is divided into three hundred and sixty equal parts, called\r\ndegrees; and any arc, as A B, contains a certain number of degrees,\r\naccording to its length. Thus, if the arc A B contains forty degrees,\r\nthen the opposite angle A C B is said to be an angle of forty degrees,\r\nand to be measured by A B. But this arc is the same part of the smaller\r\ncircle that E F is of the greater. The arc A B, therefore, contains the\r\nsame number of degrees as the arc E F, and either may be taken as the\r\nmeasure of the angle A C B. As the whole circle contains three hundred\r\nand sixty degrees, it is evident, that the quarter of a circle, or\r\n_quadrant_, contains ninety degrees, and that the semicircle A B D G\r\ncontains one hundred and eighty degrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe _complement_ of an arc, or angle, is what it wants of ninety\r\ndegrees. Thus, since A D is an arc of ninety degrees, B D is the\r\ncomplement of A B, and A B is the complement of B D. If A B denotes a\r\ncertain number of degrees of latitude, B D will be the complement of the\r\nlatitude, or the colatitude, as it is commonly written.\r\n\r\nThe _supplement_ of an arc, or angle, is what it wants of one hundred\r\nand eighty degrees. Thus, B A is the supplement of G D B, and G D B is\r\nthe supplement of B A. If B A were twenty degrees of longitude, G D B,\r\nits supplement, would be one hundred and sixty degrees. An angle is said\r\nto be _subtended_ by the side which is opposite to it. Thus, in the\r\ntriangle A C K, the angle at C is subtended by the side A K, the angle\r\nat A by C K, and the angle at K by C A. In like manner, a side is said\r\nto be subtended by an angle, as A K by the angle at C.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed with the doctrine of the sphere.\r\n\r\nA section of a sphere, by a plane cutting it in any manner, is a circle.\r\n_Great circles_ are those which pass through the centre of the sphere,\r\nand divide it into two equal hemispheres. _Small circles_ are such as do\r\nnot pass through the centre, but divide the sphere into two unequal\r\nparts. The _axis_ of a circle is a straight line passing through its\r\ncentre at right angles to its plane. The _pole_ of a great circle is the\r\npoint on the sphere where its axis cuts through the sphere. Every great\r\ncircle has two poles, each of which is every where ninety degrees from\r\nthe great circle. All great circles of the sphere cut each other in two\r\npoints diametrically opposite, and consequently their points of section\r\nare one hundred and eighty degrees apart. A great circle, which passes\r\nthrough the pole of another great circle, cuts the latter at right\r\nangles. The great circle which passes through the pole of another great\r\ncircle, and is at right angles to it, is called a _secondary_ to that\r\ncircle. The angle made by two great circles on the surface of the sphere\r\nis measured by an arc of another great circle, of which the angular\r\npoint is the pole, being the arc of that great circle intercepted\r\nbetween those two circles.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix the position of any place, either on the surface of the\r\nearth or in the heavens, both the earth and the heavens are conceived to\r\nbe divided into separate portions, by circles, which are imagined to cut\r\nthrough them, in various ways. The earth thus intersected is called the\r\n_terrestrial_, and the heavens the _celestial_, sphere. We must bear in\r\nmind, that these circles have no existence in Nature, but are mere\r\nlandmarks, artificially contrived for convenience of reference. On\r\naccount of the immense distances of the heavenly bodies, they appear to\r\nus, wherever we are placed, to be fixed in the same concave surface, or\r\ncelestial vault. The great circles of the globe, extended every way to\r\nmeet the concave sphere of the heavens, become circles of the celestial\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nThe _horizon_ is the great circle which divides the earth into upper and\r\nlower hemispheres, and separates the visible heavens from the invisible.\r\nThis is the _rational_ horizon. The _sensible_ horizon is a circle\r\ntouching the earth at the place of the spectator, and is bounded by the\r\nline in which the earth and skies seem to meet. The sensible horizon is\r\nparallel to the rational, but is distant from it by the semidiameter of\r\nthe earth, or nearly four thousand miles. Still, so vast is the distance\r\nof the starry sphere, that both these planes appear to cut the sphere in\r\nthe same line; so that we see the same hemisphere of stars that we\r\nshould see, if the upper half of the earth were removed, and we stood on\r\nthe rational horizon.\r\n\r\nThe poles of the horizon are the zenith and nadir. The _zenith_ is the\r\npoint directly over our heads; and the _nadir_, that directly under our\r\nfeet. The plumb-line (such as is formed by suspending a bullet by a\r\nstring) is in the axis of the horizon, and consequently directed towards\r\nits poles. Every place on the surface of the earth has its own horizon;\r\nand the traveller has a new horizon at every step, always extending\r\nninety degrees from him, in all directions.\r\n\r\n_Vertical circles_ are those which pass through the poles of the\r\nhorizon, (the zenith and nadir,) perpendicular to it.\r\n\r\nThe _meridian_ is that vertical circle which passes through the north\r\nand south points.\r\n\r\nThe _prime vertical_ is that vertical circle which passes through the\r\neast and west points.\r\n\r\nThe _altitude_ of a body is its elevation above the horizon, measured on\r\na vertical circle.\r\n\r\nThe _azimuth_ of a body is its distance, measured on the horizon, from\r\nthe meridian to a vertical circle passing through that body.\r\n\r\nThe _amplitude_ of a body is its distance, on the horizon, from the\r\nprime vertical to a vertical circle passing through the body.\r\n\r\nAzimuth is reckoned ninety degrees from either the north or south point;\r\nand amplitude ninety degrees from either the east or west point. Azimuth\r\nand amplitude are mutually complements of each other, for one makes up\r\nwhat the other wants of ninety degrees. When a point is _on_ the\r\nhorizon, it is only necessary to count the number of degrees of the\r\nhorizon between that point and the meridian, in order to find its\r\nazimuth; but if the point is _above_ the horizon, then its azimuth is\r\nestimated by passing a vertical circle through it, and reckoning the\r\nazimuth from the point where this circle cuts the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe _zenith distance_ of a body is measured on a vertical circle passing\r\nthrough that body. It is the complement of the altitude.\r\n\r\nThe _axis of the earth_ is the diameter on which the earth is conceived\r\nto turn in its diurnal revolution. The same line, continued until it\r\nmeets the starry concave, constitutes the _axis of the celestial\r\nsphere_.\r\n\r\nThe _poles of the earth_ are the extremities of the earth's axis: the\r\n_poles of the heavens_, the extremities of the celestial axis.\r\n\r\nThe _equator_ is a great circle cutting the axis of the earth at right\r\nangles. Hence, the axis of the earth is the axis of the equator, and its\r\npoles are the poles of the equator. The intersection of the plane of the\r\nequator with the surface of the earth constitutes the _terrestrial_, and\r\nits intersection with the concave sphere of the heavens, the\r\n_celestial_, equator. The latter, by way of distinction, is sometimes\r\ndenominated the _equinoctial_.\r\n\r\nThe secondaries to the equator,--that is, the great circles passing\r\nthrough the poles of the equator,--are called _meridians_, because that\r\nsecondary which passes through the zenith of any place is the meridian\r\nof that place, and is at right angles both to the equator and the\r\nhorizon, passing, as it does, through the poles of both. These\r\nsecondaries are also called _hour circles_ because the arcs of the\r\nequator intercepted between them are used as measures of time.\r\n\r\nThe _latitude_ of a place on the earth is its distance from the equator\r\nnorth or south. The _polar distance_, or angular distance from the\r\nnearest pole, is the complement of the latitude.\r\n\r\nThe _longitude_ of a place is its distance from some standard meridian,\r\neither east or west, measured on the equator. The meridian, usually\r\ntaken as the standard, is that of the Observatory of Greenwich, in\r\nLondon. If a place is directly _on_ the equator, we have only to\r\ninquire, how many degrees of the equator there are between that place\r\nand the point where the meridian of Greenwich cuts the equator. If the\r\nplace is north or south of the equator, then its longitude is the arc of\r\nthe equator intercepted between the meridian which passes through the\r\nplace and the meridian of Greenwich.\r\n\r\nThe _ecliptic_ is a great circle, in which the earth performs its annual\r\nrevolutions around the sun. It passes through the centre of the earth\r\nand the centre of the sun. It is found, by observation, that the earth\r\ndoes not lie with its axis at right angles to the plane of the ecliptic,\r\nso as to make the equator coincide with it, but that it is turned about\r\ntwenty-three and a half degrees out of a perpendicular direction, making\r\nan angle with the plane itself of sixty-six and a half degrees. The\r\nequator, therefore, must be turned the same distance out of a\r\ncoincidence with the ecliptic, the two circles making an angle with each\r\nother of twenty-three and a half degrees. It is particularly important\r\nthat we should form correct ideas of the ecliptic, and of its relations\r\nto the equator, since to these two circles a great number of\r\nastronomical measurements and phenomena are referred.\r\n\r\nThe _equinoctial points_, or _equinoxes_, are the intersections of the\r\necliptic and equator. The time when the sun crosses the equator, in\r\ngoing northward, is called the _vernal_, and in returning southward, the\r\n_autumnal_, equinox. The vernal equinox occurs about the twenty-first of\r\nMarch, and the autumnal, about the twenty-second of September.\r\n\r\nThe _solstitial points_ are the two points of the ecliptic most distant\r\nfrom the equator. The times when the sun comes to them are called\r\n_solstices_. The Summer solstice occurs about the twenty-second of June,\r\nand the Winter solstice about the twenty-second of December. The\r\necliptic is divided into twelve equal parts, of thirty degrees each,\r\ncalled _signs_, which, beginning at the vernal equinox, succeed each\r\nother, in the following order:\r\n\r\n     1. Aries, [Zodiac: Aries]\r\n     2. Taurus, [Zodiac: Taurus]\r\n     3. Gemini, [Zodiac: Gemini]\r\n     4. Cancer, [Zodiac: Cancer]\r\n     5. Leo, [Zodiac: Leo]\r\n     6. Virgo, [Zodiac: Virgo]\r\n     7. Libra, [Zodiac: Libra]\r\n     8. Scorpio, [Zodiac: Scorpio]\r\n     9. Sagittarius, [Zodiac: Sagittarius]\r\n    10. Capricornus, [Zodiac: Capricornus]\r\n    11. Aquarius, [Zodiac: Aquarius]\r\n    12. Pisces. [Zodiac: Pisces]\r\n\r\nThe mode of reckoning on the ecliptic is by signs, degrees, minutes, and\r\nseconds. The sign is denoted either by its name or its number. Thus, one\r\nhundred degrees may be expressed either as the tenth degree of Cancer,\r\nor as 3s 10°. It will be found an advantage to repeat the signs in their\r\nproper order, until they are well fixed in the memory, and to be able to\r\nrecognise each sign by its appropriate character.\r\n\r\nOf the various meridians, two are distinguished by the name of\r\n_colures_. The _equinoctial colure_ is the meridian which passes through\r\nthe equinoctial points. From this meridian, right ascension and\r\ncelestial longitude are reckoned, as longitude on the earth is reckoned\r\nfrom the meridian of Greenwich. The _solstitial colure_ is the meridian\r\nwhich passes through the solstitial points.\r\n\r\nThe position of a celestial body is referred to the equator by its right\r\nascension and declination. _Right ascension_ is the angular distance\r\nfrom the vernal equinox measured on the equator. If a star is situated\r\n_on_ the equator, then its right ascension is the number of degrees of\r\nthe equator between the star and the vernal equinox. But if the star is\r\nnorth or south of the equator, then its right ascension is the number of\r\ndegrees of the equator, intercepted between the vernal equinox and that\r\nsecondary to the equator which passes through the star. _Declination_ is\r\nthe distance of a body from the equator measured on a secondary to the\r\nlatter. Therefore, right ascension and declination correspond to\r\nterrestrial longitude and latitude,--right ascension being reckoned from\r\nthe equinoctial colure, in the same manner as longitude is reckoned from\r\nthe meridian of Greenwich. On the other hand, celestial longitude and\r\nlatitude are referred, not to the equator, but to the ecliptic.\r\n_Celestial longitude_ is the distance of a body from the vernal equinox\r\nmeasured on the ecliptic. _Celestial latitude_ is the distance from the\r\necliptic measured on a secondary to the latter. Or, more briefly,\r\nlongitude is distance _on_ the ecliptic: latitude, distance _from_ the\r\necliptic. The _north polar distance_ of a star is the complement of its\r\ndeclination.\r\n\r\n_Parallels of latitude_ are small circles parallel to the equator. They\r\nconstantly diminish in size, as we go from the equator to the pole. The\r\n_tropics_ are the parallels of latitude which pass through the\r\nsolstices. The northern tropic is called the tropic of Cancer; the\r\nsouthern, the tropic of Capricorn. The _polar circles_ are the parallels\r\nof latitude that pass through the poles of the ecliptic, at the distance\r\nof twenty-three and a half degrees from the poles of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe _elevation of the pole_ of the heavens above the horizon of any\r\nplace is always equal to the latitude of the place. Thus, in forty\r\ndegrees of north latitude we see the north star forty degrees above the\r\nnorthern horizon; whereas, if we should travel southward, its elevation\r\nwould grow less and less, until we reached the equator, where it would\r\nappear _in_ the horizon. Or, if we should travel northwards, the north\r\nstar would rise continually higher and higher, until, if we could reach\r\nthe pole of the earth, that star would appear directly over head. The\r\n_elevation of the equator_ above the horizon of any place is equal to\r\nthe complement of the latitude. Thus, at the latitude of forty degrees\r\nnorth, the equator is elevated fifty degrees above the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nThe earth is divided into five zones. That portion of the earth which\r\nlies between the tropics is called the _torrid zone_; that between the\r\ntropics and the polar circles, the _temperate zones_; and that between\r\nthe polar circles and the poles, the _frigid zones_.\r\n\r\nThe _zodiac_ is the part of the celestial sphere which lies about eight\r\ndegrees on each side of the ecliptic. This portion of the heavens is\r\nthus marked off by itself, because all the planets move within it.\r\n\r\nAfter endeavoring to form, from the definitions, as clear an idea as we\r\ncan of the various circles of the sphere, we may next resort to an\r\nartificial globe, and see how they are severally represented there. I do\r\nnot advise to _begin_ learning the definitions from the globe; the mind\r\nis more improved, and a power of conceiving clearly how things are in\r\nNature is more effectually acquired, by referring every thing, at first,\r\nto the grand sphere of Nature itself, and afterwards resorting to\r\nartificial representations to aid our conceptions. We can get but a very\r\nimperfect idea of a man from a profile cut in paper, unless we know the\r\noriginal. If we are acquainted with the individual, the profile will\r\nassist us to recall his appearance more distinctly than we can do\r\nwithout it. In like manner, orreries, globes, and other artificial aids,\r\nwill be found very useful, in assisting us to form distinct conceptions\r\nof the relations existing between the different circles of the sphere,\r\nand of the arrangements of the heavenly bodies; but, unless we have\r\nalready acquired some correct ideas of these things, by contemplating\r\nthem as they are in Nature, artificial globes, and especially orreries,\r\nwill be apt to mislead us.\r\n\r\nI trust you will be able to obtain the use of a globe,[1] to aid you in\r\nthe study of the foregoing definitions, or doctrine of the sphere; but\r\nif not, I would recommend the following easy device. To represent the\r\nearth, select a large _apple_, (a melon, when in season, will be found\r\nstill better.) The eye and the stem of the apple will indicate the\r\nposition of the two poles of the earth. Applying the thumb and finger of\r\nthe left hand to the poles, and holding the apple so that the poles may\r\nbe in a north and south line, turn this globe from west to east, and its\r\nmotion will correspond to the diurnal movement of the earth. Pass a wire\r\nor a knitting needle through the poles, and it will represent the _axis_\r\nof the sphere. A circle cut around the apple, half way between the\r\npoles, will be the _equator_; and several other circles cut between the\r\nequator and the poles, parallel to the equator, will represent\r\n_parallels of latitude_; of which, two, drawn twenty-three and a half\r\ndegrees from the equator, will be the _tropics_, and two others, at the\r\nsame distance from the poles, will be the _polar circles_. A great\r\ncircle cut through the poles, in a north and south direction, will form\r\nthe _meridian_, and several other great circles drawn through the poles,\r\nand of course perpendicularly to the equator, will be secondaries to the\r\nequator, constituting meridians, or _hour circles_. A great circle cut\r\nthrough the centre of the earth, from one tropic to the other, would\r\nrepresent the _plane_ of the ecliptic; and consequently a line cut round\r\nthe apple where such a section meets the surface, will be the\r\nterrestrial _ecliptic_. The points where this circle meets the tropics\r\nindicate the position of the _solstices_; and its intersection with the\r\nequator, that of the _equinoctial points_.\r\n\r\nThe _horizon_ is best represented by a circular piece of pasteboard, cut\r\nso as to fit closely to the apple, being movable upon it. When this\r\nhorizon is passed through the poles, it becomes the horizon of the\r\nequator; when it is so placed as to coincide with the earth's equator,\r\nit becomes the horizon of the poles; and in every other situation it\r\nrepresents the horizon of a place on the globe ninety degrees every way\r\nfrom it. Suppose we are in latitude forty degrees; then let us place our\r\nmovable paper parallel to our own horizon, and elevate the pole forty\r\ndegrees above it, as near as we can judge by the eye. If we cut a circle\r\naround the apple, passing through its highest part, and through the east\r\nand west points, it will represent the _prime vertical_.\r\n\r\nSimple as the foregoing device is, if you will take the trouble to\r\nconstruct one for yourself, it will lead you to more correct views of\r\nthe doctrine of the sphere, than you would be apt to obtain from the\r\nmost expensive artificial globes, although there are many other useful\r\npurposes which such globes serve, for which the apple would be\r\ninadequate. When you have thus made a sphere for yourself, or, with an\r\nartificial globe before you, if you have access to one, proceed to point\r\nout on it the various arcs of azimuth and altitude, right ascension and\r\ndeclination, terrestrial and celestial latitude and longitude,--these\r\nlast being referred to the equator on the earth, and to the ecliptic in\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\nWhen the circles of the sphere are well learned, we may advantageously\r\nemploy projections of them in various illustrations. By the _projection\r\nof the sphere_ is meant a representation of all its parts on a plane.\r\nThe plane itself is called the plane of projection. Let us take any\r\ncircular ring, as a wire bent into a circle, and hold it in different\r\npositions before the eye. If we hold it parallel to the face, with the\r\nwhole breadth opposite to the eye, we see it as an entire circle. If we\r\nturn it a little sideways, it appears oval, or as an ellipse; and, as we\r\ncontinue to turn it more and more round, the ellipse grows narrower and\r\nnarrower, until, when the edge is presented to the eye, we see nothing\r\nbut a line. Now imagine the ring to be near a perpendicular wall, and\r\nthe eye to be removed at such a distance from it, as not to distinguish\r\nany interval between the ring and the wall; then the several figures\r\nunder which the ring is seen will appear to be inscribed on the wall,\r\nand we shall see the ring as a circle, when perpendicular to a straight\r\nline joining the centre of the ring and the eye, or as an ellipse, when\r\noblique to this line, or as a straight line, when its edge is towards\r\nus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt is in this manner that the circles of the sphere are projected, as\r\nrepresented in the following diagram, Fig. 2. Here, various circles are\r\nrepresented as projected on the meridian, which is supposed to be\r\nsituated directly before the eye, at some distance from it. The horizon\r\nH O, being perpendicular to the meridian, is seen edgewise, and\r\nconsequently is projected into a straight line. The same is the case\r\nwith the prime vertical Z N, with the equator E Q, and the several small\r\ncircles parallel to the equator, which represent the two tropics and the\r\ntwo polar circles. In fact, all circles whatsoever, which are\r\nperpendicular to the plane of projection, will be represented by\r\nstraight lines. But every circle which is perpendicular to the horizon,\r\nexcept the prime vertical, being seen obliquely, as Z M N, will be\r\nprojected into an ellipse, one half only of which is seen,--the other\r\nhalf being on the other side of the plane of projection. In the same\r\nmanner, P R P, an hour circle, is represented by an ellipse on the plane\r\nof projection.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] A small pair of globes, that will answer every purpose required by\r\nthe readers of these Letters, may be had of the publishers of this Work,\r\nat a price not exceeding ten dollars; or half that sum for a celestial\r\nglobe, which will serve alone for studying astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.----TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\n  \"Here truths sublime, and sacred science charm,\r\n  Creative arts new faculties supply,\r\n  Mechanic powers give more than giant's arm,\r\n  And piercing optics more than eagle's eye;\r\n  Eyes that explore creation's wondrous laws,\r\n  And teach us to adore the great Designing Cause.\"--_Beattie_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, as I trust, you have gained a clear and familiar knowledge of the\r\ncircles and divisions of the sphere, and of the mode of estimating the\r\nposition of a heavenly body by its azimuth and altitude, or by its right\r\nascension and declination, or by its longitude and latitude, you will\r\nnow enter with advantage upon an account of those _instruments_, by\r\nmeans of which our knowledge of astronomy has been greatly promoted and\r\nperfected.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient astronomers employed no instruments of observation, but\r\nacquired their knowledge of the heavenly bodies by long-continued and\r\nmost attentive inspection with the naked eye. Instruments for measuring\r\nangles were first used in the Alexandrian school, about three hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nWherever we are situated on the earth, we appear to be in the centre of\r\na vast sphere, on the concave surface of which all celestial objects are\r\ninscribed. If we take any two points on the surface of the sphere, as\r\ntwo stars, for example, and imagine straight lines to be drawn to them\r\nfrom the eye, the angle included between these lines will be measured by\r\nthe arc of the sky contained between the two points. Thus, if D B H,\r\nFig. 3, page 30, represents the concave surface of the sphere, A, B, two\r\npoints on it, as two stars, and C A, C B, straight lines drawn from the\r\nspectator to those points, then the angular distance between them is\r\nmeasured by the arc A B, or the angle A C B. But this angle may be\r\nmeasured on a much smaller circle, having the same centre, as G F K,\r\nsince the arc E F will have the same number of degrees as the arc A B.\r\nThe simplest mode of taking an angle between two stars is by means of an\r\narm opening at a joint like the blade of a penknife, the end of the arm\r\nmoving like C E upon the graduated circle K F G. In fact, an instrument\r\nconstructed on this principle, resembling a carpenter's rule with a\r\nfolding joint, with a semicircle attached, constituted the first rude\r\napparatus for measuring the angular distance between two points on the\r\ncelestial sphere. Thus the sun's elevation above the horizon might be\r\nascertained, by placing one arm of the rule on a level with the horizon,\r\nand bringing the edge of the other into a line with the sun's centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe common surveyor's compass affords a simple example of angular\r\nmeasurement. Here, the needle lies in a north and south line, while the\r\ncircular rim of the compass, when the instrument is level, corresponds\r\nto the horizon. Hence the compass shows the azimuth of an object, or how\r\nmany degrees it lies east or west of the meridian.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, that the larger the graduated circle is, the more\r\nminutely its limb may be divided. If the circle is one foot in diameter,\r\neach degree will occupy one tenth of an inch. If the circle is twenty\r\nfeet in diameter, a degree will occupy the space of two inches, and\r\ncould be easily divided into minutes, since each minute would cover a\r\nspace one thirtieth of an inch. Refined astronomical circles are now\r\ndivided with very great skill and accuracy, the spaces between the\r\ndivisions being, when read off, magnified by a microscope; but in former\r\ntimes, astronomers had no mode of measuring small angles but by\r\nemploying very large circles. But the telescope and microscope enable us\r\nat present to measure celestial arcs much more accurately than was done\r\nby the older astronomers. In the best instruments, the measurements\r\nextend to a single second of space, or one thirty-six hundredth part of\r\na degree,--a space, on a circle twelve feet in diameter, no greater than\r\none fifty-seven hundredth part of an inch. To divide, or _graduate_,\r\nastronomical instruments, to such a degree of nicety, requires the\r\nhighest efforts of mechanical skill. Indeed, the whole art of\r\ninstrument-making is regarded as the most difficult and refined of all\r\nthe mechanical arts; and a few eminent artists, who have produced\r\ninstruments of peculiar power and accuracy, take rank with astronomers\r\nof the highest celebrity.\r\n\r\nI will endeavor to make you acquainted with several of the principal\r\ninstruments employed in astronomical observations, but especially with\r\nthe telescope, which is the most important and interesting of them all.\r\nI think I shall consult your wishes, as well as your improvement, by\r\ngiving you a clear insight into the principles of this prince of\r\ninstruments, and by reciting a few particulars, at least, respecting its\r\ninvention and subsequent history.\r\n\r\nThe _Telescope_, as its name implies, is an instrument employed for\r\nviewing distant objects.[2] It aids the eye in two ways; first, by\r\nenlarging the visual angle under which objects are seen, and, secondly,\r\nby collecting and conveying to the eye a much larger amount of the light\r\nthat emanates from the object, than would enter the naked pupil. A\r\ncomplete knowledge of the telescope cannot be acquired, without an\r\nacquaintance with the science of optics; but one unacquainted with that\r\nscience may obtain some idea of the leading principles of this noble\r\ninstrument. Its main principle is as follows: _By means of the\r\ntelescope, we first form an image of a distant object,--as the moon, for\r\nexample,--and then magnify that image by a microscope._\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nLet us first see how the image is formed. This may be done either by a\r\nconvex lens, or by a concave mirror. A convex lens is a flat piece of\r\nglass, having its two faces convex, or spherical, as is seen in a common\r\nsun-glass, or a pair of spectacles. Every one who has seen a sun-glass,\r\nknows, that, when held towards the sun, it collects the solar rays into\r\na small bright circle in the focus. This is in fact a small _image_ of\r\nthe sun. In the same manner, the image of any distant object, as a star,\r\nmay be formed, as is represented in the following diagram. Let A B C D,\r\nFig. 4, represent the tube of the telescope. At the front end, or at the\r\nend which is directed towards the object, (which we will suppose to be\r\nthe moon,) is inserted a convex lens, L, which receives the rays of\r\nlight from the moon, and collects them into the focus at _a_, forming an\r\nimage of the moon. This image is viewed by a magnifier attached to the\r\nend B C. The lens, L, is called the _object-glass_, and the microscope\r\nin B C, the _eyeglass_. We apply a microscope to this image just as we\r\nwould to any object; and, by greatly enlarging its dimensions, we may\r\nrender its various parts far more distinct than they would otherwise be;\r\nwhile, at the same time, the lens collects and conveys to the eye a much\r\ngreater quantity of light than would proceed directly from the body\r\nunder examination. A very few rays of light only, from a distant object,\r\nas a star, can enter the eye directly; but a lens one foot in diameter\r\nwill collect a beam of light of the same dimensions, and convey it to\r\nthe eye. By these means, many obscure celestial objects become\r\ndistinctly visible, which would otherwise be either too minute, or not\r\nsufficiently luminous, to be seen by us.\r\n\r\nBut the image may also be formed by means of a _concave mirror_, which,\r\nas well as the concave lens, has the property of collecting the rays of\r\nlight which proceed from any luminous body, and of forming an image of\r\nthat body. The image formed by a concave mirror is magnified by a\r\nmicroscope, in the same manner as when formed by the concave lens. When\r\nthe lens is used to form an image, the instrument is called a\r\n_refracting telescope_; when a concave mirror is used, it is called a\r\n_reflecting telescope_.\r\n\r\nThe office of the object-glass is simply _to collect_ the light, and to\r\nform an _image_ of the object, but not to magnify it: the magnifying\r\npower is wholly in the eyeglass. Hence the principle of the telescope is\r\nas follows: _By means of the object-glass_, (in the refracting\r\ntelescope,) _or by the concave mirror_, (in the reflecting telescope,)\r\n_we form an image of the object_, _and magnify that image by a\r\nmicroscope_.\r\n\r\nThe invention of this noble instrument is generally ascribed to the\r\ngreat philosopher of Florence, Galileo. He had heard that a spectacle\r\nmaker of Holland had accidentally hit upon a discovery, by which distant\r\nobjects might be brought apparently nearer; and, without further\r\ninformation, he pursued the inquiry, in order to ascertain what forms\r\nand combinations of glasses would produce such a result. By a very\r\nphilosophical process of reasoning, he was led to the discovery of that\r\npeculiar form of the telescope which bears his name.\r\n\r\nAlthough the telescopes made by Galileo were no larger than a common\r\nspyglass of the kind now used on board of ships, yet, as they gave new\r\nviews of the heavenly bodies, revealing the mountains and valleys of\r\nthe moon, the satellites of Jupiter, and multitudes of stars which are\r\ninvisible to the naked eye, it was regarded with infinite delight and\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n_Reflecting_ telescopes were first constructed by Sir Isaac Newton,\r\nalthough the use of a concave reflector, instead of an object-glass, to\r\nform the image, had been previously suggested by Gregory, an eminent\r\nScotch astronomer. The first telescope made by Newton was only six\r\ninches long. Its reflector, too, was only a little more than an inch.\r\nNotwithstanding its small dimensions, it performed so well, as to\r\nencourage further efforts; and this illustrious philosopher afterwards\r\nconstructed much larger instruments, one of which, made with his own\r\nhands, was presented to the Royal Society of London, and is now\r\ncarefully preserved in their library.\r\n\r\nNewton was induced to undertake the construction of reflecting\r\ntelescopes, from the belief that refracting telescopes were necessarily\r\nlimited to a very small size, with only moderate illuminating powers,\r\nwhereas the dimensions and powers of the former admitted of being\r\nindefinitely increased. Considerable _magnifying_ powers might, indeed,\r\nbe obtained from refractors, by making them very long; but the\r\n_brightness_ with which telescopic objects are seen, depends greatly on\r\nthe dimensions of the beam of light which is collected by the\r\nobject-glass, or by the mirror, and conveyed to the eye; and therefore,\r\nsmall object-glasses cannot have a very high illuminating power. Now,\r\nthe experiments of Newton on colors led him to believe, that it would be\r\nimpossible to employ large lenses in the construction of telescopes,\r\nsince such glasses would give to the images, they formed, the colors of\r\nthe rainbow. But later opticians have found means of correcting these\r\nimperfections, so that we are now able to use object-glasses a foot or\r\nmore in diameter, which give very clear and bright images. Such\r\ninstruments are called _achromatic_ telescopes,--a name implying the\r\nabsence of prismatic or rainbow colors in the image. It is, however, far\r\nmore difficult to construct large achromatic than large reflecting\r\ntelescopes. Very large pieces of glass can seldom be found, that are\r\nsufficiently pure for the purpose; since every inequality in the glass,\r\nsuch as waves, tears, threads, and the like, spoils it for optical\r\npurposes, as it distorts the light, and produces nothing but confused\r\nimages.\r\n\r\nThe achromatic telescope (that is, the refracting telescope, having such\r\nan object-glass as to give a colorless image) was invented by Dollond, a\r\ndistinguished English artist, about the year 1757. He had in his\r\npossession a quantity of glass of a remarkably fine quality, which\r\nenabled him to carry his invention at once to a high degree of\r\nperfection. It has ever since been, with the manufacturers of\r\ntelescopes, a matter of the greatest difficulty to find pieces of glass,\r\nof a suitable quality for object-glasses, more than two or three inches\r\nin diameter. Hence, large achromatic telescopes are very expensive,\r\nbeing valued in proportion to the _cubes_ of their diameters; that is,\r\nif a telescope whose aperture (as the breadth of the object-glass is\r\ntechnically called) is two inches, cost one hundred dollars, one whose\r\naperture is eight inches would cost six thousand four hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nSince it is so much easier to make large reflecting than large\r\nrefracting telescopes, you may ask, why the latter are ever attempted,\r\nand why reflectors are not exclusively employed? I answer, that the\r\nachromatic telescope, when large and well constructed, is a more perfect\r\nand more durable instrument than the reflecting telescope. Much more of\r\nthe light that falls on the mirror is absorbed than is lost in passing\r\nthrough the object-glass of a refractor; and hence the larger achromatic\r\ntelescopes afford a stronger light than the reflecting, unless the\r\nlatter are made of an enormous and unwieldy size. Moreover, the mirror\r\nis very liable to tarnish, and will never retain its full lustre for\r\nmany years together; and it is no easy matter to restore the lustre,\r\nwhen once impaired.\r\n\r\nIn my next Letter, I will give you an account of some of the most\r\ncelebrated telescopes that have ever been constructed, and point out the\r\nmethod of using this excellent instrument, so as to obtain with it the\r\nfinest views of the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] From two Greek words, =têle=, (_tele_,) _far_, and =schopeô=,\r\n(_skopeo_,) _to see_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV\r\n\r\nTELESCOPE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n             ----\"the broad circumference\r\n    Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb\r\n    Through _optic glass_ the Tuscan artist views\r\n    At evening, from the top of Fesolé\r\n    Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,\r\n    Rivers or mountains, in her spotted globe.\"--_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two most celebrated telescopes, hitherto made, are Herschel's\r\n_forty-feet reflector_, and the _great Dorpat refractor_. Herschel was a\r\nHanoverian by birth, but settled in England in the younger part of his\r\nlife. As early as 1774, he began to make telescopes for his own use;\r\nand, during his life, he made more than four hundred, of various sizes\r\nand powers. Under the patronage of George the Third, he completed, in\r\n1789, his great telescope, having a tube of iron, forty feet long, and a\r\nspeculum, forty-nine and a half inches or more than four feet in\r\ndiameter. Let us endeavor to form a just conception of this gigantic\r\ninstrument, which we can do only by dwelling on its dimensions, and\r\ncomparing them with those of other objects with which we are familiar,\r\nas the length or height of a house, and the breadth of a hogshead or\r\ncistern, of known dimensions. The reflector alone weighed nearly a ton.\r\nSo large and ponderous an instrument must require a vast deal of\r\nmachinery to work it, and to keep it steady; and, accordingly, the\r\nframework surrounding it was formed of heavy timbers, and resembled the\r\nframe of a large building. When one of the largest of the fixed stars,\r\nas Sirius, is entering the field of this telescope, its approach is\r\nannounced by a bright dawn, like that which precedes the rising sun; and\r\nwhen the star itself enters the field, the light is insupportable to the\r\nnaked eye. The planets are expanded into brilliant luminaries, like the\r\nmoon; and innumerable multitudes of stars are scattered like glittering\r\ndust over the celestial vault.\r\n\r\nThe great Dorpat telescope is of more recent construction. It was made\r\nby Fraunhofer, a German optician of the greatest eminence, at Munich, in\r\nBavaria, and takes its name from its being attached to the observatory\r\nat Dorpat, in Russia. It is of much smaller dimensions than the great\r\ntelescope of Herschel. Its object-glass is nine and a half inches in\r\ndiameter, and its length, fourteen feet. Although the price of this\r\ninstrument was nearly five thousand dollars, yet it is said that this\r\nsum barely covered the actual expenses. It weighs five thousand pounds,\r\nand yet is turned with the finger. In facility of management, it has\r\ngreatly the advantage of Herschel's telescope. Moreover, the sky of\r\nEngland is so much of the time unfavorable for astronomical observation,\r\nthat _one hundred_ good hours (or those in which the higher powers can\r\nbe used) are all that can be obtained in a whole year. On this account,\r\nand on account of the difficulty of shifting the position of the\r\ninstrument, Herschel estimated that it would take about six hundred\r\nyears to obtain with it even a momentary glimpse of every part of the\r\nheavens. This remark shows that such great telescopes are unsuited to\r\nthe common purposes of astronomical observation. Indeed, most of\r\nHerschel's discoveries were made with his small telescopes; and\r\nalthough, for certain rare purposes, powers were applied which magnified\r\nseven thousand times, yet, in most of his observations, powers\r\nmagnifying only two or three hundred times were employed. The highest\r\npower of the Dorpat telescope is only seven hundred, and yet the\r\ndirector of this instrument, Professor Struve, is of the opinion, that\r\nit is nearly or quite equal in quality, all things considered, to\r\nHerschel's forty-feet reflector.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally understood in what way greatness of size in a\r\ntelescope increases its powers; and it conveys but an imperfect idea of\r\nthe excellence of a telescope, to tell how much it magnifies. In the\r\nsame instrument, an increase of magnifying power is always attended with\r\na diminution of the light and of the field of view. Hence, the lower\r\npowers generally afford the most agreeable views, because they give the\r\nclearest light, and take in the largest space. The several circumstances\r\nwhich influence the qualities of a telescope are, illuminating power,\r\ndistinctness, field of view, and magnifying power. Large mirrors and\r\nlarge object-glasses are superior to smaller ones, because they collect\r\na larger beam of light, and transmit it to the eye. Stars which are\r\ninvisible to the naked eye are rendered visible by the telescope,\r\nbecause this instrument collects and conveys to the eye a large beam of\r\nthe few rays which emanate from the stars; whereas a beam of these rays\r\nof only the diameter of the pupil of the eye, would afford too little\r\nlight for distinct vision. In this particular, large telescopes have\r\ngreat advantages over small ones. The great mirror of Herschel's\r\nforty-feet reflector collects and conveys to the eye a beam more than\r\nfour feet in diameter. The Dorpat telescope also transmits to the eye a\r\nbeam nine and one half inches in diameter. This seems small, in\r\ncomparison with the reflector; but much less of the light is lost on\r\npassing through the glass than is absorbed by the mirror, and the mirror\r\nis very liable to be clouded or tarnished; so that there is not so great\r\na difference in the two instruments, in regard to illuminating power, as\r\nmight be supposed from the difference of size.\r\n\r\n_Distinctness of view_ is all-important to the performance of an\r\ninstrument. The object may be sufficiently bright, yet, if the image is\r\ndistorted, or ill-defined, the illumination is of little consequence.\r\nThis property depends mainly on the skill with which all the\r\nimperfections of figure and color in the glass or mirror are corrected,\r\nand can exist in perfection only when the image is rendered completely\r\nachromatic, and when all the rays that proceed from each point in the\r\nobject are collected into corresponding points of the image,\r\nunaccompanied by any other rays. Distinctness is very much affected by\r\nthe _steadiness_ of the instrument. Every one knows how indistinct a\r\npage becomes, when a book is passed rapidly backwards and forwards\r\nbefore the eyes, and how difficult it is to read in a carriage in rapid\r\nmotion on a rough road.\r\n\r\n_Field of view_ is another important consideration. The finest\r\ninstruments exhibit the moon, for example, not only bright and distinct,\r\nin all its parts, but they take in the whole disk at once; whereas, the\r\ninferior instruments, when the higher powers, especially, are applied,\r\npermit us to see only a small part of the moon at once.\r\n\r\nI hope, my friend, that, when you have perused these Letters, or rather,\r\nwhile you are perusing them, you will have frequent opportunities of\r\nlooking through a good telescope. I even anticipate that you will\r\nacquire such a taste for viewing the heavenly bodies with the aid of a\r\ngood glass, that you will deem a telescope a most suitable appendage to\r\nyour library, and as certainly not less an ornament to it than the more\r\nexpensive statues with which some people of fortune adorn theirs. I will\r\ntherefore, before concluding this letter, offer you a few _directions\r\nfor using the telescope_.\r\n\r\nSome states of weather, even when the sky is clear, are far more\r\nfavorable for astronomical observation than others. After sudden changes\r\nof temperature in the atmosphere, the medium is usually very unsteady.\r\nIf the sun shines out warm after a cloudy season, the ground first\r\nbecomes heated, and the air that is nearest to it is expanded, and\r\nrises, while the colder air descends, and thus ascending and descending\r\ncurrents of air, mingling together, create a confused and wavy medium.\r\nThe same cause operates when a current of hot air rises from a chimney;\r\nand hence the state of the atmosphere in cities and large towns is very\r\nunfavorable to the astronomer, on this account, as well as on account\r\nof the smoky condition in which it is usually found. After a long season\r\nof dry weather, also, the air becomes smoky, and unfit for observation.\r\nIndeed, foggy, misty, or smoky, air is so prevalent in some countries,\r\nthat only a very few times in the whole year can be found, which are\r\nentirely suited to observation, especially with the higher powers; for\r\nwe must recollect, that these inequalities and imperfections are\r\nmagnified by telescopes, as well as the objects themselves. Thus, as I\r\nhave already mentioned, not more than one hundred good hours in a year\r\ncould be obtained for observation with Herschel's great telescope. By\r\n_good_ hours, Herschel means that the sky must be very clear, the moon\r\nabsent, no twilight, no haziness, no violent wind, and no sudden change\r\nof temperature. As a general fact, the warmer climates enjoy a much\r\nfiner sky for the astronomer than the colder, having many more clear\r\nevenings, a short twilight, and less change of temperature. The watery\r\nvapor of the atmosphere, also, is more perfectly dissolved in hot than\r\nin cold air, and the more water air contains, provided it is in a state\r\nof perfect solution, the clearer it is.\r\n\r\nA _certain preparation of the observer himself_ is also requisite for\r\nthe nicest observations with the telescope. He must be free from all\r\nagitation, and the eye must not recently have been exposed to a strong\r\nlight, which contracts the pupil of the eye. Indeed, for delicate\r\nobservations, the observer should remain for some time beforehand in a\r\ndark room, to let the pupil of the eye dilate. By this means, it will be\r\nenabled to admit a larger number of the rays of light. In ascending the\r\nstairs of an observatory, visitors frequently get out of breath, and\r\nhaving perhaps recently emerged from a strongly-lighted apartment, the\r\neye is not in a favorable state for observation. Under these\r\ndisadvantages, they take a hasty look into the telescope, and it is no\r\nwonder that disappointment usually follows.\r\n\r\nWant of steadiness is a great difficulty attending the use of the\r\nhighest magnifiers; for the motions of the instrument are magnified as\r\nwell as the object. Hence, in the structure of observatories, the\r\ngreatest pains is requisite, to avoid all tremor, and to give to the\r\ninstruments all possible steadiness; and the same care is to be\r\nexercised by observers. In the more refined observations, only one or\r\ntwo persons ought to be near the instrument.\r\n\r\nIn general, _low powers_ afford better views of the heavenly bodies than\r\nvery high magnifiers. It may be thought absurd, to recommend the use of\r\nlow powers, in respect to large instruments especially, since it is\r\ncommonly supposed that the advantage of large instruments is, that they\r\nwill bear high magnifying powers. But this is not their only, nor even\r\ntheir principal, advantage. A good light and large field are qualities,\r\nfor most purposes, more important than great magnifying power; and it\r\nmust be borne in mind, that, as we increase the magnifying power in a\r\ngiven instrument, we diminish both the illumination and the field of\r\nview. Still, different objects require different magnifying powers; and\r\na telescope is usually furnished with several varieties of powers, one\r\nof which is best fitted for viewing the moon, another for Jupiter, and a\r\nstill higher power for Saturn. Comets require only the lowest\r\nmagnifiers; for here, our object is to command as much light, and as\r\nlarge a field, as possible, while it avails little to increase the\r\ndimensions of the object. On the other hand, for certain double stars,\r\n(stars which appear single to the naked eye, but double to the\r\ntelescope,) we require very high magnifiers, in order to separate these\r\nminute objects so far from each other, that the interval can be\r\ndistinctly seen. Whenever we exhibit celestial objects to inexperienced\r\nobservers, it is useful to precede the view with good _drawings_ of the\r\nobjects, accompanied by an explanation of what each appearance,\r\nexhibited in the telescope, indicates. The novice is told, that\r\nmountains and valleys can be seen in the moon by the aid of the\r\ntelescope; but, on looking, he sees a confused mass of light and shade,\r\nand nothing which looks to him like either mountains or valleys. Had his\r\nattention been previously directed to a plain drawing of the moon, and\r\neach particular appearance interpreted to him, he would then have looked\r\nthrough the telescope with intelligence and satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATORIES.\r\n\r\n    \"We, though from heaven remote, to heaven will move,\r\n    With strength of mind, and tread the abyss above;\r\n    And penetrate, with an interior light,\r\n    Those upper depths which Nature hid from sight.\r\n    Pleased we will be, to walk along the sphere\r\n    Of shining stars, and travel with the year.\"--_Ovid._\r\n\r\n\r\nAn observatory is a structure fitted up expressly for astronomical\r\nobservations, and furnished with suitable instruments for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe two most celebrated observatories, hitherto built, are that of Tycho\r\nBrahe, and that of Greenwich, near London. The observatory of Tycho\r\nBrahe, Fig. 5, was constructed at the expense of the King of Denmark, in\r\na style of royal magnificence, and cost no less than two hundred\r\nthousand crowns. It was situated on the island of Huenna, at the\r\nentrance of the Baltic, and was called Uraniburg, or the palace of the\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nBefore I give you an account of Tycho's observatory, I will recite a few\r\nparticulars respecting this great astronomer himself.\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe was of Swedish descent, and of noble family; but having\r\nreceived his education at the University of Copenhagen, and spent a\r\nlarge part of his life in Denmark, he is usually considered as a Dane,\r\nand quoted as a Danish astronomer. He was born in the year 1546. When he\r\nwas about fourteen years old, there happened a great eclipse of the sun,\r\nwhich awakened in him a high interest, especially when he saw how\r\n[Illustration Fig. 5.] accurately all the circumstances of it answered\r\nto the prediction with which he had been before made acquainted. He was\r\nimmediately seized with an irresistible passion to acquire a knowledge\r\nof the science which could so successfully lift the veil of futurity.\r\nHis friends had destined him for the profession of law, and, from the\r\nsuperior talents of which he gave early promise, and with the advantage\r\nof powerful family connexions, they had marked out for him a\r\ndistinguished career in public life. They therefore endeavored to\r\ndiscourage him from pursuing a path which they deemed so much less\r\nglorious than that, and vainly sought, by various means, to extinguish\r\nthe zeal for astronomy which was kindled in his youthful bosom.\r\nDespising all the attractions of a court, he contracted an alliance with\r\na peasant girl, and, in the peaceful retirement of domestic life,\r\ndesired no happier lot than to peruse the grand volume which the\r\nnocturnal heavens displayed to his enthusiastic imagination. He soon\r\nestablished his fame as one of the greatest astronomers of the age, and\r\nmonarchs did homage to his genius. The King of Denmark became his\r\nmunificent patron, and James the First, King of England, when he went to\r\nDenmark to complete his marriage with a Danish Princess, passed eight\r\ndays with Tycho in his observatory, and, at his departure, addressed to\r\nthe astronomer a Latin ode, accompanied with a magnificent present. He\r\ngave him also his royal license to print his works in England, and added\r\nto it the following complimentary letter: \"Nor am I acquainted with\r\nthese things on the relation of others, or from a mere perusal of your\r\nworks, but I have seen them with my own eyes, and heard them with my own\r\nears, in your residence at Uraniburg, during the various learned and\r\nagreeable conversations which I there held with you, which even now\r\naffect my mind to such a degree, that it is difficult to decide, whether\r\nI recollect them with greater pleasure or admiration.\" Admiring\r\ndisciples also crowded to this sanctuary of the sciences, to acquire a\r\nknowledge of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe observatory consisted of a main building, which was square, each\r\nside being sixty feet, and of large wings in the form of round towers.\r\nThe whole was executed in a style of great magnificence, and Tycho, who\r\nwas a nobleman by descent, gratified his taste for splendor and\r\nornament, by giving to every part of the structure an air of the most\r\nfinished elegance. Nor were the instruments with which it was furnished\r\nless magnificent than the buildings. They were vastly larger than had\r\nbefore been employed in the survey of the heavens, and many of them were\r\nadorned with costly ornaments. The cut on page 46, Fig. 6, represents\r\none of Tycho's large and splendid instruments, (an astronomical\r\nquadrant,) on one side of which was figured a representation of the\r\nastronomer and his assistants, in the midst of their instruments, and\r\nintently engaged in making and recording observations. It conveys to us\r\na striking idea of the magnificence of his arrangements, and of the\r\nextent of his operations.\r\n\r\nHere Tycho sat in state, clad in the robes of nobility, and supported\r\nthroughout his establishment the etiquette due to his rank. His\r\nobservations were more numerous than all that had ever been made before,\r\nand they were carried to a degree of accuracy that is astonishing, when\r\nwe consider that they were made without the use of the telescope, which\r\nwas not yet invented.\r\n\r\nTycho carried on his observations at Uraniburg for about twenty years,\r\nduring which time he accumulated an immense store of accurate and\r\nvaluable _facts_, which afforded the groundwork of the discovery of the\r\ngreat laws of the solar system established by Kepler, of whom I shall\r\ntell you more hereafter.\r\n\r\nBut the high marks of distinction which Tycho enjoyed, not only from his\r\nown Sovereign, but also from foreign potentates, provoked the envy of\r\nthe courtiers of his royal patron. They did not indeed venture to make\r\ntheir attacks upon him while his generous patron was living; but the\r\nKing was no sooner dead, and succeeded by a young monarch, who did not\r\nfeel the same [Illustration Fig. 6.] interest in protecting and\r\nencouraging this great ornament of the kingdom, than his envious foes\r\ncarried into execution their long-meditated plot for his ruin. They\r\nrepresented to the young King, that the treasury was exhausted, and that\r\nit was necessary to retrench a number of pensions, which had been\r\ngranted for useless purposes, and in particular that of Tycho, which,\r\nthey maintained, ought to be conferred upon some person capable of\r\nrendering greater services to the state. By these means, they succeeded\r\nin depriving him of his support, and he was compelled to retreat under\r\nthe hospitable mansion of a friend in Germany. Here he became known to\r\nthe Emperor, who invited him to Prague, where, with an ample stipend, he\r\nresumed his labors. But, though surrounded with affectionate friends and\r\nadmiring disciples, he was still an exile in a foreign land. Although\r\nhis country had been base in its ingratitude, it was yet the land which\r\nhe loved; the scene of his earliest affection; the theatre of his\r\nscientific glory. These feelings continually preyed upon his mind, and\r\nhis unsettled spirit was ever hovering among his native mountains. In\r\nthis condition he was attacked by a disease of the most painful kind,\r\nand, though its agonizing paroxysms had lengthened intermissions, yet he\r\nsaw that death was approaching. He implored his pupils to persevere in\r\ntheir scientific labors; he conversed with Kepler on some of the\r\nprofoundest points of astronomy; and with these secular occupations he\r\nmingled frequent acts of piety and devotion. In this happy condition he\r\nexpired, without pain, at the age of fifty-five.[3]\r\n\r\nThe observatory at Greenwich was not built until a hundred years after\r\nthat of Tycho Brahe, namely, in 1676. The great interests of the British\r\nnation, which are involved in navigation, constituted the ruling motive\r\nwith the government to lend their aid in erecting and maintaining this\r\nobservatory.\r\n\r\nThe site of the observatory at Greenwich is on a commanding eminence\r\nfacing the River Thames, five miles east of the central parts of London.\r\nBeing part of a royal park, the neighboring grounds are in no danger of\r\nbeing occupied by buildings, so as to obstruct the view. It is also in\r\nfull view of the shipping on the Thames; and, according to a standing\r\nregulation of the observatory, at the instant of one o'clock, every day,\r\na huge ball is dropped from over the house, as a signal to the\r\ncommanders of vessels for regulating their chronometers.\r\n\r\nThe buildings comprise a series of rooms, of sufficient number and\r\nextent to accommodate the different instruments, the inmates of the\r\nestablishment, and the library; and on the top is a celebrated camera\r\nobscura, exhibiting a most distinct and perfect picture of the grand and\r\nunrivalled scenery which this eminence commands.\r\n\r\nThis establishment, by the accuracy and extent of its observations, has\r\ncontributed more than all other institutions to perfect the science of\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nTo preside over and direct this great institution, a man of the highest\r\neminence in the science is appointed by the government, with the title\r\nof _Astronomer Royal_. He is paid an ample salary, with the\r\nunderstanding that he is to devote himself exclusively to the business\r\nof the observatory. The astronomers royal of the Greenwich observatory,\r\nfrom the time of its first establishment, in 1676, to the present time,\r\nhave constituted a series of the proudest names of which British science\r\ncan boast. A more detailed sketch of their interesting history will be\r\ngiven towards the close of these Letters.\r\n\r\nSix assistants, besides inferior laborers, are constantly in attendance;\r\nand the business of making and recording observations is conducted with\r\nthe utmost system and order.\r\n\r\nThe great objects to be attained in the construction of an observatory\r\nare, a commanding and unobstructed view of the heavens; freedom from\r\ncauses that affect the transparency and uniform state of the\r\natmosphere, such as fires, smoke, or marshy grounds; mechanical\r\nfacilities for the management of instruments, and, especially, every\r\nprecaution that is necessary to secure perfect steadiness. This last\r\nconsideration is one of the greatest importance, particularly in the use\r\nof very large magnifiers; for we must recollect, that any motion in the\r\ninstrument is magnified by the full power of the glass, and gives a\r\nproportional unsteadiness to the object. A situation is therefore\r\nselected as remote as possible from public roads, (for even the passing\r\nof carriages would give a tremulous motion to the ground, which would be\r\nsensible in large instruments,) and structures of solid masonry are\r\ncommenced deep enough in the ground to be unaffected by frost, and built\r\nup to the height required, without any connexion with the other parts of\r\nthe building. Many observatories are furnished with a movable dome for a\r\nroof, capable of revolving on rollers, so that instruments penetrating\r\nthrough the roof may be easily brought to bear upon any point at or near\r\nthe zenith.\r\n\r\nYou will not perhaps desire me to go into a minute description of all\r\nthe various instruments that are used in a well-constructed observatory.\r\nNor is this necessary, since a very large proportion of all astronomical\r\nobservations are taken on the meridian, by means of the transit\r\ninstrument and clock. When a body, in its diurnal revolution, comes to\r\nthe meridian, it is at its highest point above the horizon, and is then\r\nleast affected by refraction and parallax. This, then, is the most\r\nfavorable position for taking observations upon it. Moreover, it is\r\npeculiarly easy to take observations on a body when in this situation.\r\nHence the transit instrument and clock are the most important members of\r\nan astronomical observatory. You will, therefore, expect me to give you\r\nsome account of these instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nThe _transit instrument_ is a telescope which is fixed permanently in\r\nthe meridian, and moves only in that plane. The accompanying diagram,\r\nFig. 7, represents a side view of a portable transit instrument,\r\nexhibiting the telescope supported on a firm horizontal axis, on which\r\nit turns in the plane of the meridian, from the south point of the\r\nhorizon through the zenith to the north point. It can therefore be so\r\ndirected as to observe the passage of a star across the meridian at any\r\naltitude. The accompanying graduated circle enables the observer to set\r\nthe instrument at any required altitude, corresponding to the known\r\naltitude at which the body to be observed crosses the meridian. Or it\r\nmay be used to measure the altitude of a body, or its zenith distance,\r\nat the time of its meridian passage. Near the circle may be seen a\r\nspirit-level, which serves to show when the axis is exactly on a level\r\nwith the horizon. The framework is made of solid metal, (usually brass,)\r\nevery thing being arranged with reference to keeping the instrument\r\nperfectly steady. It stands on screws, which not only afford a steady\r\nsupport, but are useful for adjusting the instrument to a perfect\r\nlevel. The transit instrument is sometimes fixed immovably to a solid\r\nfoundation, as a pillar of stone, which is built up from a depth in the\r\nground below the reach of frost. When enclosed in a building, as in an\r\nobservatory, the stone pillar is carried up separate from the walls and\r\nfloors of the building, so as to be entirely free from the agitations to\r\nwhich they are liable.\r\n\r\nThe use of the transit instrument is to show the precise instant when a\r\nheavenly body is on the meridian, or to measure the time it occupies in\r\ncrossing the meridian. The _astronomical clock_ is the constant\r\ncompanion of the transit instrument. This clock is so regulated as to\r\nkeep exact pace with the stars, and of course with the revolution of the\r\nearth on its axis; that is, it is regulated to _sidereal_ time. It\r\nmeasures the progress of a star, indicating an hour for every fifteen\r\ndegrees, and twenty-four hours for the whole period of the revolution of\r\nthe star. Sidereal time commences when the vernal equinox is on the\r\nmeridian, just as solar time commences when the sun is on the meridian.\r\nHence the hour by the sidereal clock has no correspondence with the hour\r\nof the day, but simply indicates how long it is since the equinoctial\r\npoint crossed the meridian. For example, the clock of an observatory\r\npoints to three hours and twenty minutes; this may be in the morning, at\r\nnoon, or any other time of the day,--for it merely shows that it is\r\nthree hours and twenty minutes since the equinox was on the meridian.\r\nHence, when a star is on the meridian, the clock itself shows its right\r\nascension, which you will recollect is the angular distance measured on\r\nthe equinoctial, from the point of intersection of the ecliptic and\r\nequinoctial, called the vernal equinox, reckoning fifteen degrees for\r\nevery hour, and a proportional number of degrees and minutes for a less\r\nperiod. I have before remarked, that a very large portion of all\r\nastronomical observations are taken when the bodies are on the meridian,\r\nby means of the transit instrument and clock.\r\n\r\nHaving now described these instruments, I will next explain the manner\r\nof using them for different observations. Any thing becomes a measure of\r\ntime, which divides duration equally. The equinoctial, therefore, is\r\npeculiarly adapted to this purpose, since, in the daily revolution of\r\nthe heavens, equal portions of the equinoctial pass under the meridian\r\nin equal times. The only difficulty is, to ascertain the amount of these\r\nportions for given intervals. Now, the clock shows us exactly this\r\namount; for, when regulated to sidereal time, (as it easily may be,) the\r\nhour-hand keeps exact pace with the equator, revolving once on the\r\ndial-plate of the clock while the equator turns once by the revolution\r\nof the earth. The same is true, also, of all the small circles of\r\ndiurnal revolution; they all turn exactly at the same rate as the\r\nequinoctial, and a star situated any where between the equator and the\r\npole will move in its diurnal circle along with the clock, in the same\r\nmanner as though it were in the equinoctial. Hence, if we note the\r\ninterval of time between the passage of any two stars, as shown by the\r\nclock, we have a measure of the number of degrees by which they are\r\ndistant from each other in right ascension. Hence we see how easy it is\r\nto take arcs of right ascension: the transit instrument shows us when a\r\nbody is on the meridian; the clock indicates how long it is since the\r\nvernal equinox passed it, which is the right ascension itself; or it\r\ntells us the difference of right ascension between any two bodies,\r\nsimply by indicating the difference in time between their periods of\r\npassing the meridian. Again, it is easy to take the _declination_ of a\r\nbody when on the meridian. By declination, you will recollect, is meant\r\nthe distance of a heavenly body from the equinoctial; the same, indeed,\r\nas latitude on the earth. When a star is passing the meridian, if, on\r\nthe instant of crossing the meridian wire of the telescope, we take its\r\ndistance from the north pole, (which may readily be done, because the\r\nposition of the pole is always known, being equal to the latitude of the\r\nplace,) and subtract this distance from ninety degrees, the remainder\r\nwill be the distance from the equator, which is the declination. You\r\nwill ask, why we take this indirect method of finding the declination?\r\nWhy we do not rather take the distance of the star from the equinoctial,\r\nat once? I answer, that it is easy to point an instrument to the north\r\npole, and to ascertain its exact position, and of course to measure any\r\ndistance from it on the meridian, while, as there is nothing to mark the\r\nexact situation of the equinoctial, it is not so easy to take direct\r\nmeasurements from it. When we have thus determined the situation of a\r\nheavenly body, with respect to two great circles at right angles with\r\neach other, as in the present case, the distance of a body from the\r\nequator and from the equinoctial colure, or that meridian which passes\r\nthough the vernal equinox, we know its relative position in the heavens;\r\nand when we have thus determined the relative positions of all the\r\nstars, we may lay them down on a map or a globe, exactly as we do places\r\non the earth, by means of their latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is only a _specimen_ of the various uses of the transit\r\ninstrument, in finding the relative places of the heavenly bodies.\r\nAnother use of this excellent instrument is, to regulate our clocks and\r\nwatches. By an observation with the transit instrument, we find when the\r\nsun's centre is on the meridian. This is the exact time of _apparent_\r\nnoon. But watches and clocks usually keep _mean_ time, and therefore, in\r\norder to set our timepiece by the transit instrument, we must apply to\r\nthe apparent time of noon the equation of time, as will be explained in\r\nmy next Letter.\r\n\r\nA _noon-mark_ may easily be made by the aid of the transit instrument. A\r\nwindow sill is frequently selected as a suitable place for the mark,\r\nadvantage being taken of the shadow projected upon it by the\r\nperpendicular casing of the window. Let an assistant stand, with a rule\r\nlaid on the line of shadow, and with a knife ready to make the mark, the\r\ninstant when the observer at the transit instrument announces that the\r\ncentre of the sun is on the meridian. By a concerted signal, as the\r\nstroke of a bell, the inhabitants of a town may all fix a noon-mark from\r\nthe same observation. If the signal be given on one of the days when\r\napparent time and mean time become equal to each other, as on the\r\ntwenty-fourth of December, no equation of time is required.\r\n\r\nAs a noon-mark is convenient for regulating timepieces, I will point out\r\na method of making one, which may be practised without the aid of the\r\ntelescope. Upon a smooth, level plane, freely exposed to the sun, with a\r\npair of compasses describe a circle. In the centre, where the leg of the\r\ncompasses stood, erect a perpendicular wire of such a length, that the\r\ntermination of its shadow shall fall upon the circumference of the\r\ncircle at some hour before noon, as about ten o'clock. Make a small dot\r\nat the point where the end of the shadow falls upon the circle, and do\r\nthe same where it falls upon it again in the afternoon. Take a point\r\nhalf-way between these two points, and from it draw a line to the\r\ncentre, and it will be a true meridian line. The direction of this line\r\nwould be the same, whether it were made in the Summer or in the Winter;\r\nbut it is expedient to draw it about the fifteenth of June, for then the\r\nshadow alters its length most rapidly, and the moment of its crossing\r\nthe wire will be more definite, than in the Winter. At this time of\r\nyear, also, the sun and clock agree, or are together, as will be more\r\nfully explained in my next Letter; whereas, at other times of the year,\r\nthe time of noon, as indicated by a common clock, would not agree with\r\nthat indicated by the sun. If the upper end of the wire is flattened,\r\nand a small hole is made in it, through which the sun may shine, the\r\ninstant when this bright spot falls upon the circle will be better\r\ndefined than the termination of the shadow.\r\n\r\nAnother important instrument of the observatory is the _mural circle_.\r\nIt is a graduated circle, usually of very large size, fixed permanently\r\nin the plane of the meridian, and attached firmly to a perpendicular\r\nwall; and on its centre is a telescope, which revolves along with it,\r\nand is easily brought to bear on any object in any point in the\r\nmeridian. It is made of large size, sometimes twenty feet in diameter,\r\nin order that very small angles may be measured on its limb; for it is\r\nobvious that a small angle, as one second, will be a larger space on the\r\nlimb of an instrument, in proportion as the instrument itself is larger.\r\nThe vertical circle usually connected with the transit instrument, as in\r\nFig. 7, may indeed be employed for the same purposes as the mural\r\ncircle, namely, to measure arcs of the meridian, as meridian altitudes,\r\nzenith distances, north polar distances, and declinations; but as that\r\ncircle must necessarily be small, and therefore incapable of measuring\r\nvery minute angles, the mural circle is particularly useful in measuring\r\nthese important arcs. It is very difficult to keep so large an\r\ninstrument perfectly steady; and therefore it is attached to a massive\r\nwall of solid masonry, and is hence called a _mural_ circle, from a\r\nLatin word, (_murus_,) which signifies a wall.\r\n\r\nThe diagram, Fig. 8, page 56, represents a mural circle fixed to its\r\nwall, and ready for observations. It will be seen, that every expedient\r\nis employed to give the instrument firmness of parts and steadiness of\r\nposition. The circle is of solid metal, usually of brass, and it is\r\nstrengthened by numerous radii, which keep it from warping or bending;\r\nand these are made in the form of hollow cones, because that is the\r\nfigure which unites in the highest degree lightness and strength. On the\r\nrim of the instrument, at A, you may observe a microscope. This is\r\nattached to a micrometer,--a delicate piece of apparatus, used for\r\nreading the minute subdivisions of angles; for, after dividing the limb\r\nof the instrument as minutely as possible, it will then be necessary to\r\nmagnify those divisions with the microscope, and subdivide each of these\r\nparts with the micrometer. Thus, if we have a mural circle twenty feet\r\nin diameter, and of course nearly sixty-three feet in circumference,\r\nsince there are twenty-one thousand and six hundred minutes in the\r\nwhole circle, we shall find, by calculation, that one minute would\r\noccupy, on the limb of such an instrument, only about one thirtieth of\r\nan inch, and a second, only one eighteen hundredth of an inch. We could\r\nnot, therefore, hope to carry the actual divisions to a greater degree\r\nof minuteness than minutes; but each of these spaces may again be\r\nsubdivided into seconds by the micrometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nFrom these statements, you will acquire some faint idea of the extreme\r\ndifficulty of making perfect astronomical instruments, especially where\r\nthey are intended to measure such minute angles as one second. Indeed,\r\nthe art of constructing astronomical instruments is one which requires\r\nsuch refined mechanical genius,--so superior a mind to devise, and so\r\ndelicate a hand to execute,--that the most celebrated instrument-makers\r\ntake rank with the most distinguished astronomers; supplying, as they\r\ndo, the means by which only the latter are enabled to make these great\r\ndiscoveries. Astronomers have sometimes made their own telescopes; but\r\nthey have seldom, if ever, possessed the refined manual skill which is\r\nrequisite for graduating delicate instruments.\r\n\r\nThe _sextant_ is also one of the most valuable instruments for taking\r\ncelestial arcs, or the distance between any two points on the celestial\r\nsphere, being applicable to a much greater number of purposes than the\r\ninstruments already described. It is particularly valuable for measuring\r\ncelestial arcs at sea, because it is not, like most astronomical\r\ninstruments, affected by the motion of the ship. The principle of the\r\nsextant may be briefly described, as follows: it gives the angular\r\ndistance between any two bodies on the celestial sphere, by reflecting\r\nthe image of one of the bodies so as to coincide with the other body, as\r\nseen directly. The arc through which the reflector is turned, to bring\r\nthe reflected body to coincide with the other body, becomes a measure of\r\nthe angular distance between them. By keeping this principle in view,\r\nyou will be able to understand the use of the several parts of the\r\ninstrument, as they are exhibited in the diagram, Fig. 9, page 58.\r\n\r\nIt is, you observe, of a triangular shape, and it is made strong and\r\nfirm by metallic cross-bars. It has two reflectors, I and H, called,\r\nrespectively, the index glass and the horizon glass, both of which are\r\nfirmly fixed perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. The index\r\nglass is attached to the movable arm, ID, and turns as this is moved\r\nalong the graduated limb, EF. This arm also carries a _vernier_, at D, a\r\ncontrivance which, like the micrometer, enables us to take off minute\r\nparts of the spaces into which the limb is divided. The horizon glass,\r\nH, consists of two parts; the upper part being transparent or open, so\r\nthat the eye, looking through the telescope, T, can see through it a\r\ndistant body, as a star at S, while the lower part is a reflector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nSuppose it were required to measure the angular distance between the\r\nmoon and a certain star,--the moon being at M, and the star at S. The\r\ninstrument is held firmly in the hand, so that the eye, looking through\r\nthe telescope, sees the star, S, through the transparent part of the\r\nhorizon glass. Then the movable arm, ID, is moved from F towards E,\r\nuntil the image of M is reflected down to S, when the number of degrees\r\nand parts of a degree reckoned on the limb, from F to the index at D,\r\nwill show the angular distance between the two bodies.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] Brewster's Life of Newton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.\r\n\r\nTIME AND THE CALENDAR.\r\n\r\n    \"From old Eternity's mysterious orb\r\n    Was Time cut off, and cast beneath the skies.\"--_Young._\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING hitherto been conversant only with the many fine and sentimental\r\nthings which the poets have sung respecting Old Time, perhaps you will\r\nfind some difficulty in bringing down your mind to the calmer\r\nconsideration of what time really is, and according to what different\r\nstandards it is measured for different purposes. You will not, however,\r\nI think, find the subject even in our matter-of-fact and unpoetical way\r\nof treating it, altogether uninteresting. What, then, is time? _Time is\r\na measured portion of indefinite duration._ It consists of equal\r\nportions cut off from eternity, as a line on the surface of the earth is\r\nseparated from its contiguous portions that constitute a great circle of\r\nthe sphere, by applying to it a two-foot scale; or as a few yards of\r\ncloth are measured off from a piece of unknown or indefinite extent.\r\n\r\nAny thing, or any event which takes place at equal intervals, may become\r\na measure of time. Thus, the pulsations of the wrist, the flowing of a\r\ngiven quantity of sand from one vessel to another, as in the hourglass,\r\nthe beating of a pendulum, and the revolution of a star, have been\r\nseverally employed as measures of time. But the great standard of time\r\nis the period of the revolution of the earth on its axis, which, by the\r\nmost exact observations, is found to be always the same. I have\r\nanticipated a little of this subject, in giving an account of the\r\ntransit instrument and clock, but I propose, in this letter, to enter\r\ninto it more at large.\r\n\r\nThe time of the earth's revolution on its axis, as already explained, is\r\ncalled a sidereal day, and is determined by the revolution of a star in\r\nthe heavens. This interval is divided into twenty-four _sidereal_\r\nhours. Observations taken on numerous stars, in different ages of the\r\nworld, show that they all perform their diurnal revolution in the same\r\ntime, and that their motion, during any part of the revolution, is\r\nalways uniform. Here, then, we have an exact measure of time, probably\r\nmore exact than any thing which can be devised by art. _Solar time_ is\r\nreckoned by the apparent revolution of the sun from the meridian round\r\nto the meridian again. Were the sun stationary in the heavens, like a\r\nfixed star, the time of its apparent revolution would be equal to the\r\nrevolution of the earth on its axis, and the solar and the sidereal days\r\nwould be equal. But, since the sun passes from west to east, through\r\nthree hundred and sixty degrees, in three hundred and sixty-five and one\r\nfourth days, it moves eastward nearly one degree a day. While,\r\ntherefore, the earth is turning round on its axis, the sun is moving in\r\nthe same direction, so that, when we have come round under the same\r\ncelestial meridian from which we started, we do not find the sun there,\r\nbut he has moved eastward nearly a degree, and the earth must perform so\r\nmuch more than one complete revolution, before we come under the sun\r\nagain. Now, since we move, in the diurnal revolution, fifteen degrees in\r\nsixty minutes, we must pass over one degree in four minutes. It takes,\r\ntherefore, four minutes for us to _catch up_ with the sun, after we have\r\nmade one complete revolution. Hence the solar day is about four minutes\r\nlonger than the sidereal; and if we were to reckon the sidereal day\r\ntwenty-four hours, we should reckon the solar day twenty-four hours four\r\nminutes. To suit the purposes of society at large, however, it is found\r\nmore convenient to reckon the solar days twenty-four hours, and throw\r\nthe fraction into the sidereal day. Then,\r\n\r\n    24h. 4m. : 24h. :: 24h. : 23h. 56m. 4s.\r\n\r\nThat is, when we reduce twenty-four hours and four minutes to\r\ntwenty-four hours, the same proportion will require that we reduce the\r\nsidereal day from twenty-four hours to twenty-three hours fifty-six\r\nminutes four seconds; or, in other words, a sidereal day is such a part\r\nof a solar day. The solar days, however, do not always differ from the\r\nsidereal by precisely the same fraction, since they are not constantly\r\nof the same length. Time, as measured by the sun, is called _apparent\r\ntime_, and a clock so regulated as always to keep exactly with the sun,\r\nis said to keep apparent time. _Mean time_ is time reckoned by the\r\n_average_ length of all the solar days throughout the year. This is the\r\nperiod which constitutes the _civil_ day of twenty-four hours, beginning\r\nwhen the sun is on the lower meridian, namely, at twelve o'clock at\r\nnight, and counted by twelve hours from the lower to the upper meridian,\r\nand from the upper to the lower. The _astronomical_ day is the apparent\r\nsolar day counted through the whole twenty-four hours, (instead of by\r\nperiods of twelve hours each, as in the civil day,) and begins at noon.\r\nThus it is now the tenth of June, at nine o'clock, A.M., according to\r\ncivil time; but we have not yet reached the tenth of June by\r\nastronomical time, nor shall we, until noon to-day; consequently, it is\r\nnow June ninth, twenty-first hour of astronomical time. Astronomers,\r\nsince so many of their observations are taken on the meridian, are\r\nalways supposed to look towards the south. Geographers, having formerly\r\nbeen conversant only with the northern hemisphere, are always understood\r\nto be looking towards the north. Hence, left and right, when applied to\r\nthe astronomer, mean east and west, respectively; but to the geographer\r\nthe right is east, and the left, west.\r\n\r\nClocks are usually regulated so as to indicate mean solar time; yet, as\r\nthis is an artificial period not marked off, like the sidereal day, by\r\nany natural event, it is necessary to know how much is to be added to,\r\nor subtracted from, the apparent solar time, in order to give the\r\ncorresponding mean time. The interval, by which apparent time differs\r\nfrom mean time, is called the _equation of time_. If one clock is so\r\nconstructed as to keep exactly with the sun, going faster or slower,\r\naccording as the lengths of the solar days vary, and another clock is\r\nregulated to mean time, then the difference of the two clocks, at any\r\nperiod, would be the equation of time for that moment. If the apparent\r\nclock were _faster_ than the mean, then the equation of time must be\r\nsubtracted; but if the apparent clock were slower than the mean, then\r\nthe equation of time must be added, to give the mean time. The two\r\nclocks would differ most about the third of November, when the apparent\r\ntime is sixteen and one fourth minutes greater than the mean. But since\r\napparent time is sometimes greater and sometimes less than mean time,\r\nthe two must obviously be sometimes equal to each other. This is, in\r\nfact, the case four times a year, namely, April fifteenth, June\r\nfifteenth, September first, and December twenty-fourth.\r\n\r\nAstronomical clocks are made of the best workmanship, with every\r\nadvantage that can promote their regularity. Although they are brought\r\nto an astonishing degree of accuracy, yet they are not as regular in\r\ntheir movements as the stars are, and their accuracy requires to be\r\nfrequently tested. The transit instrument itself, when once accurately\r\nplaced in the meridian, affords the means of testing the correctness of\r\nthe clock, since one revolution of a star, from the meridian to the\r\nmeridian again, ought to correspond exactly to twenty-four hours by the\r\nclock, and to continue the same, from day to day; and the right\r\nascensions of various stars, as they cross the meridian, ought to be\r\nsuch by the clock, as they are given in the tables, where they are\r\nstated according to the accurate determinations of astronomers. Or, by\r\ntaking the difference of any two stars, on successive days, it will be\r\nseen whether the going of the clock is uniform for that part of the day;\r\nand by taking the right ascensions of different pairs of stars, we may\r\nlearn the rate of the clock at various parts of the day. We thus learn,\r\nnot only whether the clock accurately measures the length of the\r\nsidereal day, but also whether it goes uniformly from hour to hour.\r\n\r\nAlthough astronomical clocks have been brought to a great degree of\r\nperfection, so as hardly to vary a second for many months, yet none are\r\nabsolutely perfect, and most are so far from it, as to require to be\r\ncorrected by means of the transit instrument, every few days. Indeed,\r\nfor the nicest observations, it is usual not to attempt to bring the\r\nclock to a state of absolute correctness, but, after bringing it as near\r\nto such a state as can conveniently be done, to ascertain how much it\r\ngains or loses in a day; that is, to ascertain the _rate_ of its going,\r\nand to make allowance accordingly.\r\n\r\nHaving considered the manner in which the smaller divisions of time are\r\nmeasured, let us now take a hasty glance at the larger periods which\r\ncompose the calendar.\r\n\r\nAs a _day_ is the period of the revolution of the earth on its axis, so\r\na _year_ is the period of the revolution of the earth around the sun.\r\nThis time, which constitutes the _astronomical year_, has been\r\nascertained with great exactness, and found to be three hundred and\r\nsixty-five days five hours forty-eight minutes and fifty-one seconds.\r\nThe most ancient nations determined the number of days in the year by\r\nmeans of the _stylus_, a perpendicular rod which casts its shadow on a\r\nsmooth plane bearing a meridian line. The time when the shadow was\r\nshortest, would indicate the day of the Summer solstice; and the number\r\nof days which elapsed, until the shadow returned to the same length\r\nagain, would show the number of days in the year. This was found to be\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five whole days, and accordingly, this period\r\nwas adopted for the civil year. Such a difference, however, between the\r\ncivil and astronomical years, at length threw all dates into confusion.\r\nFor if, at first, the Summer solstice happened on the twenty-first of\r\nJune, at the end of four years, the sun would not have reached the\r\nsolstice until the twenty-second of June; that is, it would have been\r\nbehind its time. At the end of the next four years, the solstice would\r\nfall on the twenty-third; and in process of time, it would fall\r\nsuccessively on every day of the year. The same would be true of any\r\nother fixed date.\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar, who was distinguished alike for the variety and extent of\r\nhis knowledge, and his skill in arms, first attempted to make the\r\ncalendar conform to the motions of the sun.\r\n\r\n    \"Amidst the hurry of tumultuous war,\r\n    The stars, the gods, the heavens, were still his care.\"\r\n\r\nAided by Sosigenes, an Egyptian astronomer, he made the first correction\r\nof the calendar, by introducing an additional day every fourth year,\r\nmaking February to consist of twenty-nine instead of twenty-eight days,\r\nand of course the whole year to consist of three hundred and sixty-six\r\ndays. This fourth year was denominated _Bissextile_, because the sixth\r\nday before the Kalends of March was reckoned twice. It is also called\r\nLeap Year.\r\n\r\nThe Julian year was introduced into all the civilized nations that\r\nsubmitted to the Roman power, and continued in general use until the\r\nyear 1582. But the true correction was not six hours, but five hours\r\nforty-nine minutes; hence the addition was too great by eleven minutes.\r\nThis small fraction would amount in one hundred years to three fourths\r\nof a day, and in one thousand years to more than seven days. From the\r\nyear 325 to the year 1582, it had, in fact, amounted to more than ten\r\ndays; for it was known that, in 325, the vernal equinox fell on the\r\ntwenty-first of March, whereas, in 1582, it fell on the eleventh. It was\r\nordered by the Council of Nice, a celebrated ecclesiastical council,\r\nheld in the year 325, that Easter should be celebrated upon the first\r\nSunday after the first full moon, next following the vernal equinox; and\r\nas certain other festivals of the Romish Church were appointed at\r\nparticular seasons of the year, confusion would result from such a want\r\nof constancy between any fixed date and a particular season of the year.\r\nSuppose, for example, a festival accompanied by numerous religious\r\nceremonies, was decreed by the Church to be held at the time when the\r\nsun crossed the equator in the Spring, (an event hailed with great joy,\r\nas the harbinger of the return of Summer,) and that, in the year 325,\r\nMarch twenty-first was designated as the time for holding the festival,\r\nsince, at that period, it was on the twenty-first of March when the sun\r\nreached the equinox; the next year, the sun would reach the equinox a\r\nlittle sooner than the twenty-first of March, only eleven minutes,\r\nindeed, but still amounting in twelve hundred years to ten days; that\r\nis, in 1582, the sun reached the equinox on the eleventh of March. If,\r\ntherefore, they should continue to observe the twenty-first as a\r\nreligious festival in honor of this event, they would commit the\r\nabsurdity of celebrating it ten days after it had passed by. Pope\r\nGregory the Thirteenth, who was then at the head of the Roman See, was a\r\nman of science, and undertook to reform the calendar, so that fixed\r\ndates would always correspond to the same seasons of the year. He first\r\ndecreed, that the year should be brought forward ten days, by reckoning\r\nthe fifth of October the fifteenth; and, in order to prevent the\r\ncalendar from falling into confusion afterwards, he prescribed the\r\nfollowing rule: _Every year whose number is not divisible by four,\r\nwithout a remainder, consists of three hundred and sixty-five days;\r\nevery year which is so divisible, but is not divisible by one hundred,\r\nof three hundred and sixty-six; every year divisible by one hundred, but\r\nnot by four hundred, again, of three hundred and sixty-five; and every\r\nyear divisible by four hundred, of three hundred and sixty-six._\r\n\r\nThus the year 1838, not being divisible by four, contains three hundred\r\nand sixty-five days, while 1836 and 1840 are leap years. Yet, to make\r\nevery fourth year consist of three hundred and sixty-six days would\r\nincrease it too much, by about three fourths of a day in a century;\r\ntherefore every hundredth year has only three hundred and sixty-five\r\ndays. Thus 1800, although divisible by four, was not a leap year, but a\r\ncommon year. But we have allowed a _whole_ day in a hundred years,\r\nwhereas we ought to have allowed only _three fourths_ of a day. Hence,\r\nin four hundred years, we should allow a day too much, and therefore, we\r\nlet the four hundredth remain a leap year. This rule involves an error\r\nof less than a day in four thousand two hundred and thirty-seven years.\r\n\r\nThe Pope, who, you will recollect, at that age assumed authority over\r\nall secular princes, issued his decree to the reigning sovereigns of\r\nChristendom, commanding the observance of the calendar as reformed by\r\nhim. The decree met with great opposition among the Protestant States,\r\nas they recognised in it a new exercise of ecclesiastical tyranny; and\r\nsome of them, when they received it, made it expressly understood, that\r\ntheir acquiescence should not be construed as a submission to the Papal\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIn 1752, the Gregorian year, or _New Style_, was established in Great\r\nBritain by act of Parliament; and the dates of all deeds, and other\r\nlegal papers, were to be made according to it. As above a century had\r\nthen passed since the first introduction of the new style, eleven days\r\nwere suppressed, the third of September being called the fourteenth. By\r\nthe same act, the beginning of the year was changed from March\r\ntwenty-fifth to January first. A few persons born previously to 1752\r\nhave come down to our day, and we frequently see inscriptions on\r\ntombstones of those whose time of birth is recorded in old style. In\r\norder to make this correspond to our present mode of reckoning, we must\r\nadd eleven days to the date. Thus the same event would be June twelfth\r\nof old style, or June twenty-third of new style; and if an event\r\noccurred between January first and March twenty-fifth, the date of the\r\nyear would be advanced one, since February 1st, 1740, O.S. would be\r\nFebruary 1st, 1741, N.S. Thus, General Washington was born February\r\n11th, 1731, O.S., or February 22d, 1732, N.S. If we inquire how any\r\npresent event may be made to correspond in date to the old style, we\r\nmust subtract twelve days, and put the year back one, if the event lies\r\nbetween January first and March twenty-fifth. Thus, June tenth, N.S.\r\ncorresponds to May twenty-ninth, O.S.; and March 20th, 1840, to March\r\n8th, 1839. France, being a Roman Catholic country, adopted the new style\r\nsoon after it was decreed by the Pope; but Protestant countries, as we\r\nhave seen, were much slower in adopting it; and Russia, and the Greek\r\nChurch generally, still adhere to the old style. In order, therefore, to\r\nmake the Russian dates correspond to ours, we must add to them twelve\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIt may seem to you very remarkable, that so much pains should have been\r\nbestowed upon this subject; but without a correct and uniform standard\r\nof time, the dates of deeds, commissions, and all legal papers; of fasts\r\nand festivals, appointed by ecclesiastical authority; the returns of\r\nseasons, and the records of history,--must all fall into inextricable\r\nconfusion. To change the observance of certain religious feasts, which\r\nhave been long fixed to particular days, is looked upon as an impious\r\ninnovation; and though the times of the events, upon which these\r\nceremonies depend, are utterly unknown, it is still insisted upon by\r\ncertain classes in England, that the Glastenbury thorn blooms on\r\nChristmas day.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ancient Grecian calendar was extremely defective, yet the\r\ncommon people were entirely averse to its reformation. Their\r\nsuperstitious adherence to these errors was satirized by Aristophanes,\r\nin his comedy of the Clouds. An actor, who had just come from Athens,\r\nrecounts that he met with Diana, or the moon, and found her extremely\r\nincensed, that they did not regulate her course better. She complained,\r\nthat the order of Nature was changed, and every thing turned topsyturvy.\r\nThe gods no longer knew what belonged to them; but, after paying their\r\nvisits on certain feast-days, and expecting to meet with good cheer, as\r\nusual, they were under the disagreeable necessity of returning back to\r\nheaven without their suppers.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks, and other ancient nations, the length of the year was\r\ngenerally regulated by the course of the moon. This planet, on account\r\nof the different appearances which she exhibits at her full, change,\r\nand quarters, was considered by them as best adapted of any of the\r\ncelestial bodies for this purpose. As one lunation, or revolution of the\r\nmoon around the earth, was found to be completed in about twenty-nine\r\nand one half days, and twelve of these periods being supposed equal to\r\none revolution of the sun, their months were made to consist of\r\ntwenty-nine and thirty days alternately, and their year of three hundred\r\nand fifty-four days. But this disagreed with the annual revolution of\r\nthe sun, which must evidently govern the seasons of the year, more than\r\neleven days. The irregularities, which such a mode of reckoning would\r\noccasion, must have been too obvious not to have been observed. For,\r\nsupposing it to have been settled, at any particular time, that the\r\nbeginning of the year should be in the Spring; in about sixteen years\r\nafterwards, the beginning would have been in Autumn; and in thirty-three\r\nor thirty-four years, it would have gone backwards through all the\r\nseasons, to Spring again. This defect they attempted to rectify, by\r\nintroducing a number of days, at certain times, into the calendar, as\r\noccasion required, and putting the beginning of the year forwards, in\r\norder to make it agree with the course of the sun. But as these\r\nadditions, or _intercalations_, as they were called, were generally\r\nconsigned to the care of the priests, who, from motives of interest or\r\nsuperstition, frequently omitted them, the year was made long or short\r\nat pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe _week_ is another division of time, of the highest antiquity, which,\r\nin almost all countries, has been made to consist of seven days; a\r\nperiod supposed by some to have been traditionally derived from the\r\ncreation of the world; while others imagine it to have been regulated by\r\nthe phases of the moon. The names, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, are\r\nobviously derived from Saturn, the Sun, and the Moon; while Tuesday,\r\nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday, are the days of Tuisco, Woden, Thor,\r\nand Friga, which are Saxon names for Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, and\r\nVenus.[4]\r\n\r\nThe common year begins and ends on the same day of the week; but leap\r\nyear ends one day later than it began. Fifty-two weeks contain three\r\nhundred and sixty-four days; if, therefore, the year begins on Tuesday,\r\nfor example, we should complete fifty-two weeks on Monday, leaving one\r\nday, (Tuesday,) to complete the year, and the following year would begin\r\non Wednesday. Hence, any day of the month is one day later in the week,\r\nthan the corresponding day of the preceding year. Thus, if the sixteenth\r\nof November, 1838, falls on Friday, the sixteenth of November, 1837,\r\nfell on Thursday, and will fall, in 1839, on Saturday. But if leap year\r\nbegins on Sunday, it ends on Monday, and the following year begins on\r\nTuesday; while any given day of the month is two days later in the week\r\nthan the corresponding date of the preceding year.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] Bonnycastle's Astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\nFIGURE OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n    \"He took the golden compasses, prepared\r\n    In God's eternal store, to circumscribe\r\n    This universe, and all created things;\r\n    One foot he centred, and the other turned\r\n    Round through the vast profundity obscure,\r\n    And said, 'Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,\r\n    This be thy just circumference, O World!'\"--_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the earliest ages, the earth was regarded as one continued plane;\r\nbut, at a comparatively remote period, as five hundred years before the\r\nChristian era, astronomers began to entertain the opinion that the earth\r\nis round. We are able now to adduce various arguments which severally\r\nprove this truth. First, when a ship is coming in from sea, we first\r\nobserve only the very highest parts of the ship, while the lower\r\nportions come successively into view. Were the earth a continued plane,\r\nthe lower parts of the ship would be visible as soon as the higher, as\r\nis evident from Fig. 10, page 70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nSince light comes to the eye in straight lines, by which objects become\r\nvisible, it is evident, that no reason exists why the parts of the ship\r\nnear the water should not be seen as soon as the upper parts. But if the\r\nearth be a sphere, then the line of sight would pass above the deck of\r\nthe ship, as is represented in Fig. 11; and as the ship drew nearer to\r\nland, the lower parts would successively rise above this line and come\r\ninto view exactly in the manner known to observation. Secondly, in a\r\nlunar eclipse, which is occasioned by the moon's passing through the\r\nearth's shadow, the figure of the shadow is seen to be spherical, which\r\ncould not be the case unless the earth itself were round. Thirdly,\r\nnavigators, by steering continually in one direction, as east or west,\r\nhave in fact come round to the point from which they started, and thus\r\nconfirmed the fact of the earth's rotundity beyond all question. One may\r\nalso reach a given place on the earth, by taking directly opposite\r\ncourses. Thus, he may reach Canton in China, by a westerly route around\r\nCape Horn, or by an easterly route around the Cape of Good Hope. All\r\nthese arguments severally prove that the earth is round.\r\n\r\nBut I propose, in this Letter, to give you some account of the unwearied\r\nlabors which have been performed to ascertain the _exact_ figure of the\r\nearth; for although the earth is properly described in general language\r\nas round, yet it is not an exact sphere. Were it so, all its diameters\r\nwould be equal; but it is known that a diameter drawn through the\r\nequator exceeds one drawn from pole to pole, giving to the earth the\r\nform of a _spheroid_,--a figure resembling an orange, where the ends are\r\nflattened a little and the central parts are swelled out.\r\n\r\nAlthough it would be a matter of very rational curiosity, to investigate\r\nthe precise shape of the planet on which Heaven has fixed our abode, yet\r\nthe immense pains which has been bestowed on this subject has not all\r\narisen from mere curiosity. No accurate measurements can be taken of the\r\ndistances and magnitudes of the heavenly bodies, nor any exact\r\ndeterminations made of their motions, without a knowledge of the exact\r\nfigure of the earth; and hence is derived a powerful motive for\r\nascertaining this element with all possible precision.\r\n\r\nThe first satisfactory evidence that was obtained of the exact figure of\r\nthe earth was derived from reasoning on the effects of the earth's\r\n_centrifugal force_, occasioned by its rapid revolution on its own axis.\r\nWhen water is whirled in a pail, we see it recede from the centre and\r\naccumulate upon the sides of the vessel; and when a millstone is whirled\r\nrapidly, since the portions of the stone furthest from the centre\r\nrevolve much more rapidly than those near to it, their greater tendency\r\nto recede sometimes makes them fly off with a violent explosion. A case,\r\nwhich comes still nearer to that of the earth, is exhibited by a mass of\r\nclay revolving on a potter's wheel, as seen in the process of making\r\nearthen vessels. The mass swells out in the middle, in consequence of\r\nthe centrifugal force exerted upon it by a rapid motion. Now, in the\r\ndiurnal revolution, the equatorial parts of the earth move at the rate\r\nof about one thousand miles per hour, while the poles do not move at\r\nall; and since, as we take points at successive distances from the\r\nequator towards the pole, the rate at which these points move grows\r\nconstantly less and less; and since, in revolving bodies, the\r\ncentrifugal force is proportioned to the velocity, consequently, those\r\nparts which move with the greatest rapidity will be more affected by\r\nthis force than those which move more slowly. Hence, the equatorial\r\nregions must be higher from the centre than the polar regions; for, were\r\nnot this the case, the waters on the surface of the earth would be\r\nthrown towards the equator, and be piled up there, just as water is\r\naccumulated on the sides of a pail when made to revolve rapidly.\r\n\r\nHuyghens, an eminent astronomer of Holland, who investigated the laws of\r\ncentrifugal forces, was the first to infer that such must be the actual\r\nshape of the earth; but to Sir Isaac Newton we owe the full developement\r\nof this doctrine. By combining the reasoning derived from the known laws\r\nof the centrifugal force with arguments derived from the principles of\r\nuniversal gravitation, he concluded that the distance through the earth,\r\nin the direction of the equator, is greater than that in the direction\r\nof the poles. He estimated the difference to be about thirty-four miles.\r\n\r\nBut it was soon afterwards determined by the astronomers of France, to\r\nascertain the figure of the earth by actual measurements, specially\r\ninstituted for that purpose. Let us see how this could be effected. If\r\nwe set out at the equator and travel towards the pole, it is easy to see\r\nwhen we have advanced one degree of latitude, for this will be indicated\r\nby the rising of the north star, which appears in the horizon when the\r\nspectator stands on the equator, but rises in the same proportion as he\r\nrecedes from the equator, until, on reaching the pole, the north star\r\nwould be seen directly over head. Now, were the earth a perfect sphere,\r\nthe meridian of the earth would be a perfect circle, and the distance\r\nbetween any two places, differing one degree in latitude, would be\r\nexactly equal to the distance between any other two places, differing in\r\nlatitude to the same amount. But if the earth be a spheroid, flattened\r\nat the poles, then a line encompassing the earth from north to south,\r\nconstituting the terrestrial meridian, would not be a perfect circle,\r\nbut an ellipse or oval, having its longer diameter through the equator,\r\nand its shorter through the poles. The part of this curve included\r\nbetween two radii, drawn from the centre of the earth to the celestial\r\nmeridian, at angles one degree asunder, would be greater in the polar\r\nthan in the equatorial region; that is, the degrees of the meridian\r\nwould lengthen towards the poles.\r\n\r\nThe French astronomers, therefore, undertook to ascertain by actual\r\nmeasurements of arcs of the meridian, in different latitudes, whether\r\nthe degrees of the meridian are of uniform length, or, if not, in what\r\nmanner they differ from each other. After several indecisive\r\nmeasurements of an arc of the meridian in France, it was determined to\r\neffect simultaneous measurements of arcs of the meridian near the\r\nequator, and as near as possible to the north pole, presuming that if\r\ndegrees of the meridian, in different latitudes, are really of different\r\nlengths, they will differ most in points most distant from each other.\r\nAccordingly, in 1735, the French Academy, aided by the government, sent\r\nout two expeditions, one to Peru and the other to Lapland. Three\r\ndistinguished mathematicians, Bouguer, La Condamine, and Godin, were\r\ndespatched to the former place, and four others, Maupertius, Camus,\r\nClairault, and Lemonier, were sent to the part of Swedish Lapland which\r\nlies at the head of the Gulf of Tornea, the northern arm of the Baltic.\r\nThis commission completed its operations several years sooner than the\r\nother, which met with greater difficulties in the way of their\r\nenterprise. Still, the northern detachment had great obstacles to\r\ncontend with, arising particularly from the extreme length and severity\r\nof their Winters. The measurements, however, were conducted with care\r\nand skill, and the result, when compared with that obtained for the\r\nlength of a degree in France, plainly indicated, by its greater amount,\r\na compression of the earth towards the poles.\r\n\r\nMean-while, Bouguer and his party were prosecuting a similar work in\r\nPeru, under extraordinary difficulties. These were caused, partly by the\r\nlocalities, and partly by the ill-will and indolence of the inhabitants.\r\nThe place selected for their operations was in an elevated valley\r\nbetween two principal chains of the Andes. The lowest point of their arc\r\nwas at an elevation of a mile and a half above the level of the sea;\r\nand, in some instances, the heights of two neighboring signals differed\r\nmore than a mile. Encamped upon lofty mountains, they had to struggle\r\nagainst storms, cold, and privations of every description, while the\r\ninvincible indifference of the Indians, they were forced to employ, was\r\nnot to be shaken by the fear of punishment or the hope of reward. Yet,\r\nby patience and ingenuity, they overcame all obstacles, and executed\r\nwith great accuracy one of the most important operations, of this\r\nnature, ever undertaken. To accomplish this, however, took them nine\r\nyears; of which, three were occupied in determining the latitudes\r\nalone.[5]\r\n\r\nI have recited the foregoing facts, in order to give you some idea of\r\nthe unwearied pains which astronomers have taken to ascertain the exact\r\nfigure of the earth. You will find, indeed, that all their labors are\r\ncharacterized by the same love of accuracy. Years of toilsome watchings,\r\nand incredible labor of computation, have been undergone, for the sake\r\nof arriving only a few seconds nearer to the truth.\r\n\r\nThe length of a degree of the meridian, as measured in Peru, was less\r\nthan that before determined in France, and of course less than that of\r\nLapland; so that the spheroidal figure of the earth appeared now to be\r\nascertained by actual measurement. Still, these measures were too few in\r\nnumber, and covered too small a portion of the whole quadrant from the\r\nequator to the pole, to enable astronomers to ascertain the exact law of\r\ncurvature of the meridian, and therefore similar measurements have since\r\nbeen prosecuted with great zeal by different nations, particularly by\r\nthe French and English. In 1764, two English mathematicians of great\r\neminence, Mason and Dixon, undertook the measurement of an arc in\r\nPennsylvania, extending more than one hundred miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nThese operations are carried on by what is called a system of\r\n_triangulation_. Without some knowledge of trigonometry, you will not be\r\nable fully to understand this process; but, as it is in its nature\r\nsomewhat curious, and is applied to various other geographical\r\nmeasurements, as well as to the determination of arcs of the meridian, I\r\nam desirous that you should understand its general principles. Let us\r\nreflect, then, that it must be a matter of the greatest difficulty, to\r\nexecute with exactness the measurement of a line of any great length in\r\none continued direction on the earth's surface. Even if we select a\r\nlevel and open country, more or less inequalities of surface will occur;\r\nrivers must be crossed, morasses must be traversed, thickets must be\r\npenetrated, and innumerable other obstacles must be surmounted; and\r\nfinally, every time we apply an artificial measure, as a rod, for\r\nexample, we obtain a result not absolutely perfect. Each error may\r\nindeed be very small, but small errors, often repeated, may produce a\r\nformidable aggregate. Now, one unacquainted with trigonometry can easily\r\nunderstand the fact, that, when we know certain parts of a triangle, we\r\ncan find the other parts by calculation; as, in the rule of three in\r\narithmetic, we can obtain the fourth term of a proportion, from having\r\nthe first three terms given. Thus, in the triangle A B C, Fig. 12, if we\r\nknow the side A B, and the angles at A and B, we can find by\r\ncomputation, the other sides, A C and B C, and the remaining angle at C.\r\nSuppose, then, that in measuring an arc of the meridian through any\r\ncountry, the line were to pass directly through A B, but the ground was\r\nso obstructed between A and B, that we could not possibly carry our\r\nmeasurement through it. We might then measure another line, as A C,\r\nwhich was accessible, and with a compass take the bearing of B from the\r\npoints A and C, by which means we should learn the value of the angles\r\nat A and C. From these data we might calculate, by the rules of\r\ntrigonometry, the exact length of the line A B. Perhaps the ground might\r\nbe so situated, that we could not reach the point B, by any route;\r\nstill, if it could be seen from A and C, it would be all we should want.\r\nThus, in conducting a trigonometrical survey of any country, conspicuous\r\nsignals are placed on elevated points, and the bearings of these are\r\ntaken from the extremities of a known line, called the base, and thus\r\nthe relative situation of various places is accurately determined. Were\r\nwe to undertake to run an exact north and south line through any\r\ncountry, as New England, we should select, near one extremity, a spot of\r\nground favorable for actual measurement, as a level, unobstructed plain;\r\nwe should provide a measure whose length in feet and inches was\r\ndetermined with the greatest possible precision, and should apply it\r\nwith the utmost care. We should thus obtain a _base line_. From the\r\nextremities of this line, we should take (with some appropriate\r\ninstrument) the bearing of some signal at a greater or less distance,\r\nand thus we should obtain one side and two angles of a triangle, from\r\nwhich we could find, by the rules of trigonometry, either of the unknown\r\nsides. Taking this as a new base, we might take the bearing of another\r\nsignal, still further on our way, and thus proceed to run the required\r\nnorth and south line, without actually measuring any thing more than the\r\nfirst, or base line. Thus, in Fig. 13, we wish to measure the distance\r\nbetween the two points A and O, which are both on the same meridian, as\r\nis known by their having the same longitude; but, on account of various\r\nobstacles, it would be found very inconvenient to measure this line\r\ndirectly, with a rod or chain, and even if we could do it, we could not\r\nby this method obtain nearly so accurate a result, as we could by a\r\nseries of triangles, where, after the base line was measured, we should\r\nhave nothing else to measure except angles, which can be determined, by\r\nobservation, to a greater degree of exactness, than lines. We therefore,\r\nin the first place, measure the base line, A B, with the utmost\r\nprecision. Then, taking the bearing of some signal at C from A and B, we\r\nobtain the means of calculating the side B C, as has been already\r\nexplained. Taking B C as a new base, we proceed, in like manner, to\r\ndetermine successively the sides C D, D E, and E F, and also A C, and C\r\nE. Although A C is not in the direction of the meridian, but\r\nconsiderably to the east of it, yet it is easy to find the corresponding\r\ndistance on the meridian, A M; and in the same manner we can find the\r\nportions of the meridian M N and N O, corresponding respectively to C E\r\nand E F. Adding these several parts of the meridian together, we obtain\r\nthe length of the arc from A to O, in miles; and by observations on the\r\nnorth star, at each extremity of the arc, namely, at A and at O, we\r\ncould determine the difference of latitude between these two points.\r\nSuppose, for example, that the distance between A and O is exactly five\r\ndegrees, and that the length of the intervening line is three hundred\r\nand forty-seven miles; then, dividing the latter by the former number,\r\nwe find the length of a degree to be sixty-nine miles and four tenths.\r\nTo take, however, a few of the results actually obtained, they are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Places of observation.   Latitude.      Length of a deg.\r\n                                               in miles.\r\n    Peru,                   00° 00' 00\"         68.732\r\n    Pennsylvania,           39  12  00          68.896\r\n    France,                 46  12  00          69.054\r\n    England,                51  29  54-1/2      69.146\r\n    Sweden,                 66  20  10          69.292\r\n\r\nThis comparison shows, that the length of a degree gradually increases,\r\nas we proceed from the equator towards the pole. Combining the results\r\nof various estimates, the dimensions of the terrestrial spheroid are\r\nfound to be as follows:\r\n\r\n    Equatorial diameter,        7925.648 miles.\r\n    Polar diameter,             7899.170   \"\r\n    Average diameter,           7912.409   \"\r\n\r\nThe difference between the greatest and the least is about twenty-six\r\nand one half miles, which is about one two hundred and ninety-ninth part\r\nof the greatest. This fraction is denominated the _ellipticity_ of the\r\nearth,--being the excess of the equatorial over the polar diameter.\r\n\r\nThe operations, undertaken for the purpose of determining the figure of\r\nthe earth, have been conducted with the most refined exactness. At any\r\nstage of the process, the length of the last side, as obtained by\r\ncalculation, may be actually measured in the same manner as the base\r\nfrom which the series of triangles commenced. When thus measured, it is\r\ncalled the _base of verification_. In some surveys, the base of\r\nverification, when taken at a distance of four hundred miles from the\r\nstarting point, has not differed more than one foot from the same line,\r\nas determined by calculation.\r\n\r\nAnother method of arriving at the exact figure of the earth is, by\r\nobservations with the _pendulum_. If a pendulum, like that of a clock,\r\nbe suspended, and the number of its vibrations per hour be counted, they\r\nwill be found to be different in different latitudes. A pendulum that\r\nvibrates thirty-six hundred times per hour, at the equator, will vibrate\r\nthirty-six hundred and five and two thirds times, at London, and a still\r\ngreater number of times nearer the north pole. Now, the vibrations of\r\nthe pendulum are produced by the force of gravity. Hence their\r\ncomparative number at different places is a measure of the relative\r\nforces of gravity at those places. But when we know the relative forces\r\nof gravity at different places, we know their relative distances from\r\nthe centre of the earth; because the nearer a place is to the centre of\r\nthe earth, the greater is the force of gravity. Suppose, for example, we\r\nshould count the number of vibrations of a pendulum at the equator, and\r\nthen carry it to the north pole, and count the number of vibrations made\r\nthere in the same time,--we should be able, from these two observations,\r\nto estimate the relative forces of gravity at these two points; and,\r\nhaving the relative forces of gravity, we can thence deduce their\r\nrelative distances from the centre of the earth, and thus obtain the\r\npolar and equatorial diameters. Observations of this kind have been\r\ntaken with the greatest accuracy, in many places on the surface of the\r\nearth, at various distances from each other, and they lead to the same\r\nconclusions respecting the figure of the earth, as those derived from\r\nmeasuring arcs of the meridian. It is pleasing thus to see a great\r\ntruth, and one apparently beyond the pale of human investigation,\r\nreached by two routes entirely independent of each other. Nor, indeed,\r\nare these the only proofs which have been discovered of the spheroidal\r\nfigure of the earth. In consequence of the accumulation of matter above\r\nthe equatorial regions of the earth, a body weighs less there than\r\ntowards the poles, being further removed from the centre of the earth.\r\nThe same accumulation of matter, by the force of attraction which it\r\nexerts, causes slight inequalities in the motions of the moon; and since\r\nthe amount of these becomes a measure of the force which produces them,\r\nastronomers are able, from these inequalities, to calculate the exact\r\nquantity of the matter thus accumulated, and hence to determine the\r\nfigure of the earth. The result is not essentially different from that\r\nobtained by the other methods. Finally, the shape of the earth's shadow\r\nis altered, by its spheroidal figure,--a circumstance which affects the\r\ntime and duration of a lunar eclipse. All these different and\r\nindependent phenomena afford a pleasing example of the harmony of truth.\r\nThe known effects of the centrifugal force upon a body revolving on its\r\naxis, like the earth, lead us to infer that the earth is of a spheroidal\r\nfigure; but if this be the fact, the pendulum ought to vibrate faster\r\nnear the pole than at the equator, because it would there be nearer the\r\ncentre of the earth. On trial, such is found to be the case. If, again,\r\nthere be such an accumulation of matter about the equatorial regions,\r\nits effects ought to be visible in the motions of the moon, which it\r\nwould influence by its gravity; and there, also, its effects are traced.\r\nAt length, we apply our measures to the surface of the earth itself, and\r\nfind the same fact, which had thus been searched out among the hidden\r\nthings of Nature, here palpably exhibited before our eyes. Finally, on\r\nestimating from these different sources, what the exact amount of the\r\ncompression at the poles must be, all bring out nearly one and the same\r\nresult. This truth, so harmonious in itself, takes along with it, and\r\nestablishes, a thousand other truths on which it rests.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[5] Library of Useful Knowledge: History of Astronomy, page 95.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDIURNAL REVOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n    \"To some she taught the fabric of the sphere,\r\n    The changeful moon, the circuit of the stars,\r\n    The golden zones of heaven.\"--_Akenside._\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH the elementary knowledge already acquired, you will now be able to\r\nenter with pleasure and profit on the various interesting phenomena\r\ndependent on the revolution of the earth on its axis and around the sun.\r\nThe apparent diurnal revolution of the heavenly bodies, from east to\r\nwest, is owing to the actual revolution of the earth on its own axis,\r\nfrom west to east. If we conceive of a radius of the earth's equator\r\nextended until it meets the concave sphere of the heavens, then, as the\r\nearth revolves, the extremity of this line would trace out a curve on\r\nthe face of the sky; namely, the celestial equator. In curves parallel\r\nto this, called the _circles of diurnal revolution_, the heavenly bodies\r\nactually _appear_ to move, every star having its own peculiar circle.\r\nAfter you have first rendered familiar the real motion of the earth from\r\nwest to east, you may then, without danger of misapprehension, adopt the\r\ncommon language, that all the heavenly bodies revolve around the earth\r\nonce a day, from east to west, in circles parallel to the equator and to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nI must remind you, that the time occupied by a star, in passing from any\r\npoint in the meridian until it comes round to the same point again, is\r\ncalled a _sidereal day_, and measures the period of the earth's\r\nrevolution on its axis. If we watch the returns of the same star from\r\nday to day, we shall find the intervals exactly equal to each other;\r\nthat is, _the sidereal days are all equal_. Whatever star we select for\r\nthe observation, the same result will be obtained. The stars, therefore,\r\nalways keep the same relative position, and have a common movement\r\nround the earth,--a consequence that naturally flows from the hypothesis\r\nthat their _apparent_ motion is all produced by a single _real_ motion;\r\nnamely, that of the earth. The sun, moon, and planets, as well as the\r\nfixed stars, revolve in like manner; but their returns to the meridian\r\nare not, like those of the fixed stars, at exactly equal intervals.\r\n\r\nThe _appearances_ of the diurnal motions of the heavenly bodies are\r\ndifferent in different parts of the earth,--since every place has its\r\nown horizon, and different horizons are variously inclined to each\r\nother. Nothing in astronomy is more apt to mislead us, than the\r\nobstinate habit of considering the horizon as a fixed and immutable\r\nplane, and of referring every thing to it. We should contemplate the\r\nearth as a huge globe, occupying a small portion of space, and encircled\r\non all sides, at an immense distance, by the starry sphere. We should\r\nfree our minds from their habitual proneness to consider one part of\r\nspace as naturally _up_ and another _down_, and view ourselves as\r\nsubject to a force (gravity) which binds us to the earth as truly as\r\nthough we were fastened to it by some invisible cords or wires, as the\r\nneedle attaches itself to all sides of a spherical loadstone. We should\r\ndwell on this point, until it appears to us as truly up, in the\r\ndirection B B, C C, D D, when one is at B, C, D, respectively, as in the\r\ndirection A A, when he is at A, Fig. 14.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose the spectator viewing the diurnal revolutions from\r\nseveral different positions on the earth. On the _equator_, his horizon\r\nwould pass through both poles; for the horizon cuts the celestial vault\r\nat ninety degrees in every direction from the zenith of the spectator;\r\nbut the pole is likewise ninety degrees from his zenith, when he stands\r\non the equator; and consequently, the pole must be in the horizon. Here,\r\nalso, the celestial equator would coincide with the prime vertical,\r\nbeing a great circle passing through the east and west points. Since all\r\nthe diurnal circles are parallel to the equator, consequently, they\r\nwould all, like the equator be perpendicular to the horizon. Such a\r\nview of the heavenly bodies is called a right sphere, which may be thus\r\ndefined: _a right sphere is one in which all the daily revolutions of\r\nthe stars are in circles perpendicular to the horizon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nA right sphere is seen only at the equator. Any star situated in the\r\ncelestial equator would appear to rise directly in the east, at midnight\r\nto be in the zenith of the spectator, and to set directly in the west.\r\nIn proportion as stars are at a greater distance from the equator\r\ntowards the pole, they describe smaller and smaller circles, until, near\r\nthe pole, their motion is hardly perceptible.\r\n\r\nIf the spectator advances one degree from the equator towards the north\r\npole, his horizon reaches one degree beyond the pole of the earth, and\r\ncuts the starry sphere one degree below the pole of the heavens, or\r\nbelow the north star, if that be taken as the place of the pole. As he\r\nmoves onward towards the pole, his horizon continually reaches further\r\nand further beyond it, until, when he comes to the pole of the earth,\r\nand under the pole of the heavens, his horizon reaches on all sides to\r\nthe equator, and coincides with it. Moreover, since all the circles of\r\ndaily motion are parallel to the equator, they become, to the spectator\r\nat the pole, parallel to the horizon. Or, _a parallel sphere is that in\r\nwhich all the circles of daily motion are parallel to the horizon_.\r\n\r\nTo render this view of the heavens familiar, I would advise you to\r\nfollow round in mind a number of separate stars, in their diurnal\r\nrevolution, one near the horizon, one a few degrees above it, and a\r\nthird near the zenith. To one who stood upon the north pole, the stars\r\nof the northern hemisphere would all be perpetually in view when not\r\nobscured by clouds, or lost in the sun's light, and none of those of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere would ever be seen. The sun would be constantly\r\nabove the horizon for six months in the year, and the remaining six\r\ncontinually out of sight. That is, at the pole, the days and nights are\r\neach six months long. The appearances at the south pole are similar to\r\nthose at the north.\r\n\r\nA perfect parallel sphere can never be seen, except at one of the\r\npoles,--a point which has never been actually reached by man; yet the\r\nBritish discovery ships penetrated within a few degrees of the north\r\npole, and of course enjoyed the view of a sphere nearly parallel.\r\n\r\nAs the circles of daily motion are parallel to the horizon of the pole,\r\nand perpendicular to that of the equator, so at all places between the\r\ntwo, the diurnal motions are oblique to the horizon. This aspect of the\r\nheavens constitutes an oblique sphere, which is thus defined: _an\r\noblique sphere is that in which the circles of daily motion are oblique\r\nto the horizon_.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, that the spectator is at the latitude of fifty\r\ndegrees. His horizon reaches fifty degrees beyond the pole of the earth,\r\nand gives the same apparent elevation to the pole of the heavens. It\r\ncuts the equator and all the circles of daily motion, at an angle of\r\nforty degrees,--being always equal to what the altitude of the pole\r\nlacks of ninety degrees: that is, it is always equal to the co-altitude\r\nof the pole. Thus, let H O, Fig. 15, represent the horizon, E Q the\r\nequator, and P P´ the axis of the earth. Also, _l l, m m, n n_,\r\nparallels of latitude. Then the horizon of a spectator at Z, in latitude\r\nfifty degrees, reaches to fifty degrees beyond the pole; and the angle E\r\nC H, which the equator makes with the horizon, is forty degrees,--the\r\ncomplement of the latitude. As we advance still further north, the\r\nelevation of the diurnal circle above the horizon grows less and less,\r\nand consequently, the motions of the heavenly bodies more and more\r\noblique to the horizon, until finally, at the pole, where the latitude\r\nis ninety degrees, the angle of elevation of the equator vanishes, and\r\nthe horizon and the equator coincide with each other, as before stated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n_The circle of perpetual apparition is the boundary of that space around\r\nthe elevated pole, where the stars never set._ Its distance from the\r\npole is equal to the latitude of the place. For, since the altitude of\r\nthe pole is equal to the latitude, a star, whose polar distance is just\r\nequal to the latitude, will, when at its lowest point, only just reach\r\nthe horizon; and all the stars nearer the pole than this will evidently\r\nnot descend so far as the horizon. Thus _m m_, Fig. 15, is the circle of\r\nperpetual apparition, between which and the north pole, the stars never\r\nset, and its distance from the pole, O P, is evidently equal to the\r\nelevation of the pole, and of course to the latitude.\r\n\r\nIn the opposite hemisphere, a similar part of the sphere adjacent to the\r\ndepressed pole never rises. Hence, _the circle of perpetual occultation\r\nis the boundary of that space around the depressed pole, within which\r\nthe stars never rise._\r\n\r\nThus _m´ m´_, Fig. 15, is the circle of perpetual occultation, between\r\nwhich and the south pole, the stars never rise.\r\n\r\nIn an oblique sphere, the horizon cuts the circles of daily motion\r\nunequally. Towards the elevated pole, more than half the circle is above\r\nthe horizon, and a greater and greater portion, as the distance from the\r\nequator is increased, until finally, within the circle of perpetual\r\napparition, the whole circle is above the horizon. Just the opposite\r\ntakes place in the hemisphere next the depressed pole. Accordingly, when\r\nthe sun is in the equator, as the equator and horizon, like all other\r\ngreat circles of the sphere, bisect each other, the days and nights are\r\nequal all over the globe. But when the sun is north of the equator, the\r\ndays become longer than the nights, but shorter, when the sun is south\r\nof the equator. Moreover, the higher the latitude, the greater is the\r\ninequality in the lengths of the days and nights. By examining Fig. 15,\r\nyou will easily see how each of these cases must hold good.\r\n\r\nMost of the appearances of the diurnal revolution can be explained,\r\neither on the supposition that the celestial sphere actually turns\r\naround the earth once in twenty-four hours, or that this motion of the\r\nheavens is merely apparent, arising from the revolution of the earth on\r\nits axis, in the opposite direction,--a motion of which we are\r\ninsensible, as we sometimes lose the consciousness of our own motion in\r\na ship or steam-boat, and observe all external objects to be receding\r\nfrom us, with a common motion. Proofs, entirely conclusive and\r\nsatisfactory, establish the fact, that it is the earth, and not the\r\ncelestial sphere, that turns; but these proofs are drawn from various\r\nsources, and one is not prepared to appreciate their value, or even to\r\nunderstand some of them, until he has made considerable proficiency in\r\nthe study of astronomy, and become familiar with a great variety of\r\nastronomical phenomena. To such a period we will therefore postpone the\r\ndiscussion of the earth's rotation on its axis.\r\n\r\nWhile we retain the same place on the earth, the diurnal revolution\r\noccasions no change in our horizon, but our horizon goes round, as well\r\nas ourselves. Let us first take our station on the equator, at sunrise;\r\nour horizon now passes through both the poles and through the sun, which\r\nwe are to conceive of as at a great distance from the earth, and\r\ntherefore as cut, not by the terrestrial, but by the celestial, horizon.\r\nAs the earth turns, the horizon dips more and more below the sun, at the\r\nrate of fifteen degrees for every hour; and, as in the case of the polar\r\nstar, the sun appears to rise at the same rate. In six hours, therefore,\r\nit is depressed ninety degrees below the sun, bringing us directly under\r\nthe sun, which, for our present purpose, we may consider as having all\r\nthe while maintained the same fixed position in space. The earth\r\ncontinues to turn, and in six hours more, it completely reverses the\r\nposition of our horizon, so that the western part of the horizon, which\r\nat sunrise was diametrically opposite to the sun, now cuts the sun, and\r\nsoon afterwards it rises above the level of the sun, and the sun sets.\r\nDuring the next twelve hours, the sun continues on the invisible side of\r\nthe sphere, until the horizon returns to the position from which it set\r\nout, and a new day begins.\r\n\r\nLet us next contemplate the similar phenomena at the _poles_. Here the\r\nhorizon, coinciding, as it does, with the equator, would cut the sun\r\nthrough its centre and the sun would appear to revolve along the surface\r\nof the sea, one half above and the other half below the horizon. This\r\nsupposes the sun in its annual revolution to be at one of the equinoxes.\r\nWhen the sun is north of the equator, it revolves continually round in a\r\ncircle, which, during a single revolution, appears parallel to the\r\nequator, and it is constantly day; and when the sun is south of the\r\nequator, it is, for the same reason, continual night.\r\n\r\nWhen we have gained a clear idea of the appearances of the diurnal\r\nrevolutions, as exhibited to a spectator at the equator and at the pole,\r\nthat is, in a right and in a parallel sphere, there will be little\r\ndifficulty in imagining how they must be in the intermediate latitudes,\r\nwhich have an oblique sphere.\r\n\r\nThe appearances of the sun and stars, presented to the inhabitants of\r\ndifferent countries, are such as correspond to the sphere in which they\r\nlive. Thus, in the fervid climates of India, Africa, and South America,\r\nthe sun mounts up to the highest regions of the heavens, and descends\r\ndirectly downwards, suddenly plunging beneath the horizon. His rays,\r\ndarting almost vertically upon the heads of the inhabitants, strike with\r\na force unknown to the people of the colder climates; while in places\r\nremote from the equator, as in the north of Europe, the sun, in Summer,\r\nrises very far in the north, takes a long circuit towards the south, and\r\nsets as far northward in the west as the point where it rose on the\r\nother side of the meridian. As we go still further north, to the\r\nnorthern parts of Norway and Sweden, for example, to the confines of the\r\nfrigid zone, the Summer's sun just grazes the northern horizon, and at\r\nnoon appears only twenty-three and one half degrees above the southern.\r\nOn the other hand, in mid-winter, in the north of Europe, as at St.\r\nPetersburgh, the day dwindles almost to nothing,--lasting only while the\r\nsun describes a very short arc in the extreme south. In some parts of\r\nSiberia and Iceland, the only day consists of a little glimmering of the\r\nsun on the verge of the southern horizon, at noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.\r\n\r\nPARALLAX AND REFRACTION.\r\n\r\n    \"Go, wondrous creature! mount where science guides,\r\n    Go measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides;\r\n    Instruct the planets in what orbs to run,\r\n    Correct old Time, and regulate the sun.\"--_Pope._\r\n\r\n\r\nI THINK you must have felt some astonishment, that astronomers are able\r\nto calculate the exact distances and magnitudes of the sun, moon, and\r\nplanets. We should, at the first thought, imagine that such knowledge as\r\nthis must be beyond the reach of the human faculties, and we might be\r\ninclined to suspect that astronomers practise some deception in this\r\nmatter, for the purpose of exciting the admiration of the unlearned. I\r\nwill therefore, in the present Letter, endeavor to give you some clear\r\nand correct views respecting the manner in which astronomers acquire\r\nthis knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn our childhood, we all probably adopt the notion that the sky is a\r\nreal dome of definite surface, in which the heavenly bodies are fixed.\r\nWhen any objects are beyond a certain distance from the eye, we lose all\r\npower of distinguishing, by our sight alone, between different\r\ndistances, and cannot tell whether a given object is one million or a\r\nthousand millions of miles off. Although the bodies seen in the sky are\r\nin fact at distances extremely various,--some, as the clouds, only a few\r\nmiles off; others, as the moon, but a few thousand miles; and others, as\r\nthe fixed stars, innumerable millions of miles from us,--yet, as our eye\r\ncannot distinguish these different distances, we acquire the habit of\r\nreferring all objects beyond a moderate height to one and the same\r\nsurface, namely, an imaginary spherical surface, denominated the\r\ncelestial vault. Thus, the various objects represented in the diagram on\r\nnext page, though differing very much in shape and diameter, would all\r\nbe _projected_ upon the sky alike, and compose a part, indeed, of the\r\nimaginary vault itself. The place which each object occupies is\r\ndetermined by lines drawn from the eye of the spectator through the\r\nextremities of the body, to meet the imaginary concave sphere. Thus, to\r\na spectator at O, Fig 16, the several lines A B, C D, and E F, would all\r\nbe projected into arches on the face of the sky, and be seen as parts of\r\nthe sky itself, as represented by the lines A´ B´, C´ D´, and E´ F´. And\r\nwere a body actually to move in the several directions indicated by\r\nthese lines, they would appear to the spectator to describe portions of\r\nthe celestial vault. Thus, even when moving through the crooked line,\r\nfrom _a_ to _b_, a body would appear to be moving along the face of the\r\nsky, and of course in a regular curve line, from _c_ to _d_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nBut, although all objects, beyond a certain moderate height, are\r\nprojected on the imaginary surface of the sky, yet different spectators\r\nwill project the same object on _different parts_ of the sky. Thus, a\r\nspectator at A, Fig. 17, would see a body, C, at M, while a spectator at\r\nB would see the same body at N. This change of place in a body, as seen\r\nfrom different points, is called parallax, which is thus defined:\r\n_parallax is the apparent change of place which bodies undergo by being\r\nviewed from different points_. [Illustration Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe arc M N is called the _parallactic arc_, and the angle A C B, the\r\n_parallactic angle_.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, from the figure, that near objects are much more affected\r\nby parallax than distant ones. Thus, the body C, Fig. 17, makes a much\r\ngreater parallax than the more distant body D,--the former being\r\nmeasured by the arc M N, and the latter by the arc O P. We may easily\r\nimagine bodies to be so distant, that they would appear projected at\r\nvery nearly the same point of the heavens, when viewed from places very\r\nremote from each other. Indeed, the fixed stars, as we shall see more\r\nfully hereafter, are so distant, that spectators, a hundred millions of\r\nmiles apart, see each star in one and the same place in the heavens.\r\n\r\nIt is by means of parallax, that astronomers find the distances and\r\nmagnitudes of the heavenly bodies. In order fully to understand this\r\nsubject, one requires to know something of trigonometry, which science\r\nenables us to find certain unknown parts of a triangle from certain\r\nother parts which are known. Although you may not be acquainted with the\r\nprinciples of trigonometry, yet you will readily understand, from your\r\nknowledge of arithmetic, that from certain things given in a problem\r\nothers may be found. Every triangle has of course three sides and three\r\nangles; and, if we know two of the angles and one of the sides, we can\r\nfind all the other parts, namely, the remaining angle and the two\r\nunknown sides. Thus, in the triangle A B C, Fig. 18, if we know the\r\nlength of the side A B, and how many degrees each of the angles A B C\r\nand B C A contains, we can find the length of the side B C, or of the\r\nside A C, and the remaining angle at A. Now, let us apply these\r\nprinciples to the measurements of some of the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 19, let A represent the earth, C H the horizon, and H Z a\r\nquadrant of a great circle of the heavens, extending from the horizon to\r\nthe zenith; and let E, F, G, O, be successive positions of the moon, at\r\ndifferent elevations, from the horizon to the meridian. Now, a spectator\r\non the surface of the earth, at A, would refer the moon, when at E, to\r\n_h_, on the face of the sky, whereas, if seen from the centre of the\r\nearth, it would appear at H. So, when the moon was at F, a spectator at\r\nA would see it at _p_, while, if seen from the centre, it would have\r\nappeared at P. The parallactic arcs, H _h_, P _p_, R _r_, grow\r\ncontinually smaller and smaller, as a body is situated higher above the\r\nhorizon; and when the body is in the zenith, then the parallax vanishes\r\naltogether, for at O the moon would be seen at Z, whether viewed from A\r\nor C.\r\n\r\nSince, then, a heavenly body is liable to be referred to different\r\npoints on the celestial vault, when seen from different parts of the\r\nearth, and thus some confusion be occasioned in the determination of\r\npoints on the celestial sphere, astronomers have agreed to consider the\r\ntrue place of a celestial object to be that where it would appear, if\r\nseen from the centre of the earth; and the doctrine of parallax teaches\r\nhow to reduce observations made at any place on the surface of the\r\nearth, to such as they would be, if made from the centre.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon, or any heavenly body, is seen in the horizon, as at E,\r\nthe change of place is called the horizontal parallax. Thus, the angle A\r\nE C, measures the horizontal parallax of the moon. Were a spectator to\r\nview the earth from the centre of the moon, he would see the\r\nsemidiameter of the earth under this same angle; hence, _the horizontal\r\nparallax of any body is the angle subtended by the semidiameter of the\r\nearth, as seen from the body_. Please to remember this fact.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the figure, that the effect of parallax upon the\r\nplace of a celestial body is to _depress_ it. Thus, in consequence of\r\nparallax, E is depressed by the arc H _h_; F, by the arc P _p_; G, by\r\nthe arc R _r_; while O sustains no change. Hence, in all calculations\r\nrespecting the altitude of the sun, moon, or planets, the amount of\r\nparallax is to be added: the stars, as we shall see hereafter, have no\r\nsensible parallax.\r\n\r\nIt is now very easy to see how, when the parallax of a body is known, we\r\nmay find its distance from the centre of the earth. Thus, in the\r\ntriangle A C E, Fig. 19, the side A C is known, being the semidiameter\r\nof the earth; the angle C A E, being a right angle, is also known; and\r\nthe parallactic angle, A E C, is found from observation; and it is a\r\nwell-known principle of trigonometry, that when we have any two angles\r\nof a triangle, we may find the remaining angle by subtracting the sum of\r\nthese two from one hundred and eighty degrees. Consequently, in the\r\ntriangle A E C, we know all the angles and one side, namely, the side A\r\nC; hence, we have the means of finding the side C E, which is the\r\ndistance from the centre of the earth to the centre of the moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nWhen the distance of a heavenly body is known, and we can measure, with\r\ninstruments, its angular breadth, we can easily determine its\r\n_magnitude_. Thus, if we have the distance of the moon, E S, Fig. 20,\r\nand half the breadth of its disk S C, (which is measured by the angle S\r\nE C,) we can find the length of the line, S C, in miles. Twice this line\r\nis the diameter of the body; and when we know the diameter of a sphere,\r\nwe can, by well-known rules, find the contents of the surface, and its\r\nsolidity.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps be curious to know, _how the moon's horizontal parallax\r\nis found_; for it must have been previously ascertained, before we could\r\napply this method to finding the distance of the moon from the earth.\r\nSuppose that two astronomers take their stations on the same meridian,\r\nbut one south of the equator, as at the Cape of Good Hope, and another\r\nnorth of the equator, as at Berlin, in Prussia, which two places lie\r\nnearly on the same meridian. The observers would severally refer the\r\nmoon to different points on the face of the sky,--the southern observer\r\ncarrying it further north, and the northern observer further south,\r\nthan its true place, as seen from the centre of the earth. This will be\r\nplain from the diagram, Fig. 21. If A and B represent the positions of\r\nthe spectators, M the moon, and C D an arc of the sky, then it is\r\nevident, that C D would be the parallactic arc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\nThese observations furnish materials for calculating, by the aid of\r\ntrigonometry, the moon's horizontal parallax, and we have before seen\r\nhow, when we know the parallax of a heavenly body, we can find both its\r\ndistance from the earth and its magnitude.\r\n\r\nBeside the change of place which these heavenly bodies undergo, in\r\nconsequence of parallax, there is another, of an opposite kind, arising\r\nfrom the effect of the atmosphere, called _refraction_. Refraction\r\nelevates the apparent place of a body, while parallax depresses it. It\r\naffects alike the most distant as well as nearer bodies.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the nature of refraction, we must consider, that\r\nan object always appears in the direction in which the _last_ ray of\r\nlight comes to the eye. If the light which comes from a star were bent\r\ninto fifty directions before it reached the eye, the star would\r\nnevertheless appear in the line described by the ray nearest the eye.\r\nThe operation of this principle is seen when an oar, or any stick, is\r\nthrust into water. As the rays of light by which the oar is seen have\r\ntheir direction changed as they pass out of water into air, the apparent\r\ndirection in which the body is seen is changed in the same degree,\r\ngiving it a bent appearance,--the part below the water having apparently\r\na different direction from the part above. Thus, in Fig. 22, page 96, if\r\nS _a x_ be the oar, S _a b_ will be the bent appearance, as affected by\r\nrefraction. The transparent substance through which any ray of light\r\npasses is called a _medium_. It is a general fact in optics, that, when\r\nlight passes out of a rarer into a denser medium, as out of air into\r\nwater, or out of space into air, it is turned _towards_ a perpendicular\r\nto the surface of the medium; and when it passes out of a denser into a\r\nrarer medium, as out of water into air, it is turned _from_ the\r\nperpendicular. In the above case, the light, passing out of space into\r\nair, is turned towards the radius of the earth, this being perpendicular\r\nto the surface of the atmosphere; and it is turned more and more towards\r\nthat radius the nearer it approaches to the earth, because the density\r\nof the air rapidly increases near the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\nLet us now conceive of the atmosphere as made up of a great number of\r\nparallel strata, as A A, B B, C C, and D D, increasing rapidly in\r\ndensity (as is known to be the fact) in approaching near to the surface\r\nof the earth. Let S be a star, from which a ray of light, S _a_, enters\r\nthe atmosphere at _a_, where, being much turned towards the radius of\r\nthe convex surface, it would change its direction into the line _a b_,\r\nand again into _b c_, and _c_ O, reaching the eye at O. Now, since an\r\nobject always appears in the direction in which the light finally\r\nstrikes the eye, the star would be seen in the direction O _c_, and,\r\nconsequently, the star would apparently change its place, by\r\nrefraction, from S to S´, being elevated out of its true position.\r\nMoreover, since, on account of the continual increase of density in\r\ndescending through the atmosphere, the light would be continually turned\r\nout of its course more and more, it would therefore move, not in the\r\npolygon represented in the figure, but in a corresponding curve line,\r\nwhose curvature is rapidly increased near the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhen a body is in the zenith, since a ray of light from it enters the\r\natmosphere at right angles to the refracting medium, it suffers no\r\nrefraction. Consequently, the position of the heavenly bodies, when in\r\nthe zenith, is not changed by refraction, while, near the horizon, where\r\na ray of light strikes the medium very obliquely, and traverses the\r\natmosphere through its densest part, the refraction is greatest. The\r\nwhole amount of refraction, when a body is in the horizon, is\r\nthirty-four minutes; while, at only an elevation of one degree, the\r\nrefraction is but twenty-four minutes; and at forty-five degrees, it is\r\nscarcely a single minute. Hence it is always important to make our\r\nobservations on the heavenly bodies when they are at as great an\r\nelevation as possible above the horizon, being then less affected by\r\nrefraction than at lower altitudes.\r\n\r\nSince the whole amount of refraction near the horizon exceeds\r\nthirty-three minutes, and the diameters of the sun and moon are\r\nseverally less than this, these luminaries are in view both before they\r\nhave actually risen and after they have set.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of refraction near the horizon is strikingly evinced\r\nby the _oval_ figure which the sun assumes when near the horizon, and\r\nwhich is seen to the greatest advantage when light clouds enable us to\r\nview the solar disk. Were all parts of the sun equally raised by\r\nrefraction, there would be no change of figure; but, since the lower\r\nside is more refracted than the upper, the effect is to shorten the\r\nvertical diameter, and thus to give the disk an oval form. This effect\r\nis particularly remarkable when the sun, at his rising or setting, is\r\nobserved from the top of a mountain, or at an elevation near the\r\nseashore; for in such situations, the rays of light make a greater angle\r\nthan ordinary with a perpendicular to the refracting medium, and the\r\namount of refraction is proportionally greater. In some cases of this\r\nkind, the shortening of the vertical diameter of the sun has been\r\nobserved to amount to six minutes, or about one fifth of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe apparent enlargement of the sun and moon, when near the horizon,\r\narises from an optical illusion. These bodies, in fact, are not seen\r\nunder so great an angle when in the horizon as when on the meridian, for\r\nthey are nearer to us in the latter case than in the former. The\r\ndistance of the sun, indeed, is so great, that it makes very little\r\ndifference in his apparent diameter whether he is viewed in the horizon\r\nor on the meridian; but with the moon, the case is otherwise; its\r\nangular diameter, when measured with instruments, is perceptibly larger\r\nwhen at its culmination, or highest elevation above the horizon. Why,\r\nthen, do the sun and moon appear so much larger when near the horizon?\r\nIt is owing to a habit of the mind, by which we judge of the magnitudes\r\nof distant objects, not merely by the angle they subtend at the eye, but\r\nalso by our impressions respecting their distance, allowing, under a\r\ngiven angle, a greater magnitude as we imagine the distance of a body to\r\nbe greater. Now, on account of the numerous objects usually in sight\r\nbetween us and the sun, when he is near the horizon, he appears much\r\nfurther removed from us than when on the meridian; and we unconsciously\r\nassign to him a proportionally greater magnitude. If we view the sun, in\r\nthe two positions, through a smoked glass, no such difference of size is\r\nobserved; for here no objects are seen but the sun himself.\r\n\r\n_Twilight_ is another phenomenon depending on the agency of the earth's\r\natmosphere. It is that illumination of the sky which takes place just\r\nbefore sunrise and which continues after sunset. It is owing partly to\r\nrefraction, and partly to reflection, but mostly to the latter. While\r\nthe sun is within eighteen degrees of the horizon, before it rises or\r\nafter it sets, some portion of its light is conveyed to us, by means of\r\nnumerous reflections from the atmosphere. At the equator, where the\r\ncircles of daily motion are perpendicular to the horizon, the sun\r\ndescends through eighteen degrees in an hour and twelve minutes. The\r\nlight of day, therefore, declines rapidly, and as rapidly advances after\r\ndaybreak in the morning. At the pole, a constant twilight is enjoyed\r\nwhile the sun is within eighteen degrees of the horizon, occupying\r\nnearly two thirds of the half year when the direct light of the sun is\r\nwithdrawn, so that the progress from continual day to constant night is\r\nexceedingly gradual. To an inhabitant of an oblique sphere, the twilight\r\nis longer in proportion as the place is nearer the elevated pole.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the power the atmosphere has of dispersing the solar\r\nlight, and scattering it in various directions, no objects would be\r\nvisible to us out of direct sunshine; every shadow of a passing cloud\r\nwould involve us in midnight darkness; the stars would be visible all\r\nday; and every apartment into which the sun had not direct admission\r\nwould be involved in the obscurity of night. This scattering action of\r\nthe atmosphere on the solar light is greatly increased by the\r\nirregularity of temperature caused by the sun, which throws the\r\natmosphere into a constant state of undulation; and by thus bringing\r\ntogether masses of air of different temperatures, produces partial\r\nreflections and refractions at their common boundaries, by which means\r\nmuch light is turned aside from a direct course, and diverted to the\r\npurposes of general illumination.[6] In the upper regions of the\r\natmosphere, as on the tops of very high mountains, where the air is too\r\nmuch rarefied to reflect much light, the sky assumes a black appearance,\r\nand stars become visible in the day time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the atmosphere is usually so transparent, that it is invisible\r\nto us, yet we as truly move and live in a fluid as fishes that swim in\r\nthe sea. Considered in comparison with the whole earth, the atmosphere\r\nis to be regarded as a thin layer investing the surface, like a film of\r\nwater covering the surface of an orange. Its actual height, however, is\r\nover a hundred miles, though we cannot assign its precise boundaries.\r\nBeing perfectly elastic, the lower portions, bearing as they do, the\r\nweight of all the mass above them, are greatly compressed, while the\r\nupper portions having little to oppose the natural tendency of air to\r\nexpand, diffuse themselves widely. The consequence is, that the\r\natmosphere undergoes a rapid diminution of density, as we ascend from\r\nthe earth, and soon becomes exceedingly rare. At so moderate a height as\r\nseven miles, it is four times rarer than at the surface, and continues\r\nto grow rare in the same proportion, namely, being four times less for\r\nevery seven miles of ascent. It is only, therefore, within a few miles\r\nof the earth, that the atmosphere is sufficiently dense to sustain\r\nclouds and vapors, which seldom rise so high as eight miles, and are\r\nusually much nearer to the earth than this. So rare does the air become\r\non the top of Mount Chimborazo, in South America, that it is incompetent\r\nto support most of the birds that fly near the level of the sea. The\r\ncondor, a bird which has remarkably long wings, and a light body, is the\r\nonly bird seen towering above this lofty summit. The transparency of the\r\natmosphere,--a quality so essential to fine views of the starry\r\nheavens,--is much increased by containing a large proportion of water,\r\nprovided it is perfectly dissolved, or in a state of invisible vapor. A\r\ncountry at once hot and humid, like some portions of the torrid zone,\r\npresents a much brighter and more beautiful view of the moon and stars,\r\nthan is seen in cold climates. Before a copious rain, especially in hot\r\nweather, when the atmosphere is unusually humid, we sometimes observe\r\nthe sky to be remarkably resplendent, even in our own latitude.\r\nAccordingly, this unusual clearness of the sky, when the stars shine\r\nwith unwonted brilliancy, is regarded as a sign of approaching rain; and\r\nwhen, after the rain is apparently over, the air is remarkably\r\ntransparent, and distant objects on the earth are seen with uncommon\r\ndistinctness, while the sky exhibits an unusually deep azure, we may\r\nconclude that the serenity is only temporary, and that the rain will\r\nprobably soon return.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[6] Sir J. Herschel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE SUN.\r\n\r\n    \"Great source of day! best image here below\r\n    Of thy Creator, ever pouring wide,\r\n    From world to world, the vital ocean round,\r\n    On Nature write, with every beam, His praise.\"--_Thomson._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE subjects which have occupied the preceding Letters are by no means\r\nthe most interesting parts of our science. They constitute, indeed,\r\nlittle more than an introduction to our main subject, but comprise such\r\nmatters as are very necessary to be clearly understood, before one is\r\nprepared to enter with profit and delight upon the more sublime and\r\ninteresting field which now opens before us.\r\n\r\nWe will begin our survey of the heavenly bodies with the SUN, which\r\nfirst claims our homage, as the natural monarch of the skies. The moon\r\nwill next occupy our attention; then the other bodies which compose the\r\nsolar system, namely, the planets and comets; and, finally, we shall\r\nleave behind this little province in the great empire of Nature, and\r\nwing a bolder flight to the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nThe _distance_ of the sun from the earth is about ninety-five millions\r\nof miles. It may perhaps seem incredible to you, that astronomers should\r\nbe able to determine this fact with any degree of certainty. Some,\r\nindeed, not so well informed as yourself, have looked upon the\r\nmarvellous things that are told respecting the distances, magnitudes,\r\nand velocities, of the heavenly bodies, as attempts of astronomers to\r\nimpose on the credulity of the world at large; but the certainty and\r\nexactness with which the predictions of astronomers are fulfilled, as an\r\neclipse, for example, ought to inspire full confidence in their\r\nstatements. I can assure you, my dear friend, that the evidence on which\r\nthese statements are founded is perfectly satisfactory to those whose\r\nattainments in the sciences qualify them to understand them; and, so far\r\nare astronomers from wishing to impose on the unlearned, by announcing\r\nsuch wonderful discoveries as they have made among the heavenly bodies,\r\nno class of men have ever shown a stricter regard and zeal than they for\r\nthe exact truth, wherever it is attainable.\r\n\r\nNinety-five millions of miles is indeed a vast distance. No human mind\r\nis adequate to comprehend it fully; but the nearest approaches we can\r\nmake towards it are gained by successive efforts of the mind to conceive\r\nof great distances, beginning with such as are clearly within our grasp.\r\nLet us, then, first take so small a distance as that of the breadth of\r\nthe Atlantic ocean, and follow, in mind, a ship, as she leaves the port\r\nof New York, and, after twenty days' steady sail, reaches Liverpool.\r\nHaving formed the best idea we are able of this distance, we may then\r\nreflect, that it would take a ship, moving constantly at the rate of ten\r\nmiles per hour, more than a thousand years to reach the sun.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the sun is towards a million of miles; or, more exactly,\r\nit is eight hundred and eighty-five thousand miles. One hundred and\r\ntwelve bodies as large as the earth, lying side by side, would be\r\nrequired to reach across the solar disk; and our ship, sailing at the\r\nsame rate as before, would be ten years in passing over the same space.\r\nImmense as is the sun, we can readily understand why it appears no\r\nlarger than it does, when we reflect, that its distance is still more\r\nvast. Even large objects on the earth, when seen on a distant eminence,\r\nor over a wide expanse of water, dwindle almost to a point. Could we\r\napproach nearer and nearer to the sun, it would constantly expand its\r\nvolume, until finally it would fill the whole vault of heaven. We could,\r\nhowever, approach but little nearer to the sun without being consumed by\r\nthe intensity of his heat. Whenever we come nearer to any fire, the heat\r\nrapidly increases, being four times as great at half the distance, and\r\none hundred times as great at one tenth the distance. This fact is\r\nexpressed by saying, that the heat increases as the square of the\r\ndistance decreases. Our globe is situated at such a distance from the\r\nsun, as exactly suits the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Were it either\r\nmuch nearer or much more remote, they could not exist, constituted as\r\nthey are. The intensity of the solar light also follows the same law.\r\nConsequently, were we nearer to the sun than we are, its blaze would be\r\ninsufferable; or, were we much further off, the light would be too dim\r\nto serve all the purposes of vision.\r\n\r\nThe sun is one million four hundred thousand times as large as the\r\nearth; but its matter is not more than about one fourth as dense as that\r\nof the earth, being only a little heavier than water, while the average\r\ndensity of the earth is more than five times that of water. Still, on\r\naccount of the immense magnitude of the sun, its entire quantity of\r\nmatter is three hundred and fifty thousand times as great as that of the\r\nearth. Now, the force of gravity in a body is greater, in proportion as\r\nits quantity of matter is greater. Consequently, we might suppose, that\r\nthe weight of a body (weight being nothing else than the measure of the\r\nforce of gravity) would be increased in the same proportion; or, that a\r\nbody, which weighs only one pound at the surface of the earth, would\r\nweigh three hundred and fifty thousand pounds at the sun. But we must\r\nconsider, that the attraction exerted by any body is the same as though\r\nall the matter were concentrated in the centre. Thus, the attraction\r\nexerted by the earth and by the sun is the same as though the entire\r\nmatter of each body were in its centre. Hence, on account of the vast\r\ndimensions of the sun, its surface is one hundred and twelve times\r\nfurther from its centre than the surface of the earth is from its\r\ncentre; and, since the force of gravity diminishes as the square of the\r\ndistance increases, that of the sun, exerted on bodies at its surface,\r\nis (so far as this cause operates) the square of one hundred and twelve,\r\nor twelve thousand five hundred and forty-four times less than that of\r\nthe earth. If, therefore, we increase the weight of a body three hundred\r\nand fifty-four thousand times, in consequence of the greater amount of\r\nmatter in the sun, and diminish it twelve thousand five hundred and\r\nforty-four times, in consequence of the force acting at a greater\r\ndistance from the body, we shall find that the body would weigh about\r\ntwenty-eight times more on the sun than on the earth. Hence, a man\r\nweighing three hundred pounds would, if conveyed to the surface of the\r\nsun, weigh eight thousand four hundred pounds, or nearly three tons and\r\nthree quarters. A limb of our bodies, weighing forty pounds, would\r\nrequire to lift it a force of one thousand one hundred and twenty\r\npounds, which would be beyond the ordinary power of the muscles. At the\r\nsurface of the earth, a body falls from rest by the force of gravity, in\r\none second, sixteen and one twelfth feet; but at the surface of the sun,\r\na body would, in the same time, fall through four hundred and\r\nforty-eight and seven tenths feet.\r\n\r\nThe sun turns on his own axis once in a little more than twenty-five\r\ndays. This fact is known by observing certain dark places seen by the\r\ntelescope on the sun's disk, called _solar spots_. These are very\r\nvariable in size and number. Sometimes, the sun's disk, when viewed with\r\na telescope, is quite free from spots, while at other times we may see a\r\ndozen or more distinct clusters, each containing a great number of\r\nspots, some large and some very minute. Occasionally, a single spot is\r\nso large as to be visible to the naked eye, especially when the sun is\r\nnear the horizon, and the glare of his light is taken off. One measured\r\nby Dr. Herschel was no less than fifty thousand miles in diameter. A\r\nsolar spot usually consists of two parts, the _nucleus_ and the _umbra_.\r\nThe nucleus is black, of a very irregular shape, and is subject to great\r\nand sudden changes, both in form and size. Spots have sometimes seemed\r\nto burst asunder, and to project fragments in different directions. The\r\numbra is a wide margin, of lighter shade, and is often of greater extent\r\nthan the nucleus. The spots are usually confined to a zone extending\r\nacross the central regions of the sun, not exceeding sixty degrees in\r\nbreadth. Fig. 23 exhibits the appearance of the solar spots. As these\r\nspots have all a common motion from day to day, across the sun's disk;\r\nas they go off at one limb, and, after a certain interval, sometimes\r\ncome on again on the opposite limb, it is inferred that this apparent\r\nmotion is imparted to them by an actual revolution of the sun on his own\r\naxis. We know that the spots must be in contact, or very nearly so, at\r\nleast, with the body of the sun, and cannot be bodies revolving around\r\nit, which are projected on the solar disk when they are between us and\r\nthe sun; for, in that case, they would not be so long in view as out of\r\nview, as will be evident from inspecting the following diagram. Let S,\r\nFig. 24, page 106, represent the sun, and _b_ a body revolving round it\r\nin the orbit _a b c_; and let E represent the earth, where, of course,\r\nthe spectator is situated. The body would be seen projected on the sun\r\nonly while passing from _b_ to _c_, while, throughout the remainder of\r\nits orbit, it would be out of view, whereas no such inequality exists in\r\nrespect to the two periods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\nIf you ask, what is the _cause_ of the solar spots, I can only tell you\r\nwhat different astronomers have supposed respecting them. They attracted\r\nthe notice of Galileo soon after the invention of the telescope, and he\r\nformed an hypothesis respecting their nature. Supposing the sun to\r\nconsist of a solid body embosomed in a sea of liquid fire, he believed\r\nthat the spots are composed of black cinders, formed in the interior of\r\nthe sun by volcanic action, which rise and float on the surface of the\r\nfiery sea. The chief objections to this hypothesis are, first, the _vast\r\nextent_ of some of the spots, covering, as they do, two thousand\r\nmillions of square miles, or more,--a space which it is incredible\r\nshould be filled by lava in so short a time as that in which the spots\r\nare sometimes formed; and, secondly, the _sudden disappearance_ which\r\nthe spots sometimes undergo, a fact which can hardly be accounted for by\r\nsupposing, as Galileo did, that such a vast accumulation of matter all\r\nat once sunk beneath the fiery flood. Moreover, we have many reasons for\r\nbelieving that the spots are _depressions_ below the general surface.\r\n\r\nLa Lande, an eminent French astronomer of the last century, held that\r\nthe sun is a solid, opaque body, having its exterior diversified with\r\nhigh mountains and deep valleys, and covered all over with a burning sea\r\nof liquid matter. The spots he supposed to be produced by the flux and\r\nreflux of this fiery sea, retreating occasionally from the mountains,\r\nand exposing to view a portion of the dark body of the sun. But it is\r\ninconsistent with the nature of fluids, that a liquid, like the sea\r\nsupposed, should depart so far from its equilibrium and remain so long\r\nfixed, as to lay bare the immense spaces occupied by some of the solar\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nDr. Herschel's views respecting the nature and constitution of the sun,\r\nembracing an explanation of the solar spots, have, of late years, been\r\nvery generally received by the astronomical world. This great\r\nastronomer, after attentively viewing the surface of the sun, for a long\r\ntime, with his large telescopes, came to the following conclusions\r\nrespecting the nature of this luminary. He supposes the sun to be a\r\nplanetary body like our earth, diversified with mountains and valleys,\r\nto which, on account of the magnitude of the sun, he assigns a\r\nprodigious extent, some of the mountains being six hundred miles high,\r\nand the valleys proportionally deep. He employs in his explanation no\r\nvolcanic fires, but supposes two separate regions of dense clouds\r\nfloating in the solar atmosphere, at different distances from the sun.\r\nThe exterior stratum of clouds he considers as the depository of the\r\nsun's light and heat, while the inferior stratum serves as an awning or\r\nscreen to the body of the sun itself, which thus becomes fitted to be\r\nthe residence of animals. The proofs offered in support of this\r\nhypothesis are chiefly the following: first, that the appearances, as\r\npresented to the telescope, are such as accord better with the idea that\r\nthe fluctuations arise from the motions of clouds, than that they are\r\nowing to the agitations of a liquid, which could not depart far enough\r\nfrom its general level to enable us to see its waves at so great a\r\ndistance, where a line forty miles in length would subtend an angle at\r\nthe eye of only the tenth part of a second; secondly, that, since clouds\r\nare easily dispersed to any extent, the great dimensions which the solar\r\nspots occasionally exhibit are more consistent with this than with any\r\nother hypothesis; and, finally, that a lower stratum of clouds, similar\r\nto those of our atmosphere, was frequently seen by the Doctor, far below\r\nthe luminous clouds which are the fountains of light and heat.\r\n\r\nSuch are the views of one who had, it must be acknowledged, great\r\npowers of observation, and means of observation in higher perfection\r\nthan have ever been enjoyed by any other individual; but, with all\r\ndeference to such authority, I am compelled to think that the hypothesis\r\nis encumbered with very serious objections. Clouds analogous to those of\r\nour atmosphere (and the Doctor expressly asserts that his lower stratum\r\nof clouds are analogous to ours, and reasons respecting the upper\r\nstratum according to the same analogy) cannot exist in hot air; they are\r\ntenants only of cold regions. How can they be supposed to exist in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of a fire so intense, that they are even dissipated\r\nby it at the distance of ninety-five millions of miles? Much less can\r\nthey be supposed to be the depositories of such devouring fire, when any\r\nthing in the form of clouds, floating in our atmosphere, is at once\r\nscattered and dissolved by the accession of only a few degrees of heat.\r\nNothing, moreover, can be imagined more unfavorable for radiating heat\r\nto such a distance, than the light, inconstant matter of which clouds\r\nare composed, floating loosely in the solar atmosphere. There is a\r\nlogical difficulty in the case: it is ascribing to things properties\r\nwhich they are not known to possess; nay, more, which they are known not\r\nto possess. From variations of light and shade in objects seen at\r\nmoderate distances on the earth, we are often deceived in regard to\r\ntheir appearances; and we must distrust the power of an astronomer to\r\ndecide upon the nature of matter seen at the distance of ninety-five\r\nmillions of miles.\r\n\r\nI think, therefore, we must confess our ignorance of the nature and\r\nconstitution of the sun; nor can we, as astronomers, obtain much more\r\nsatisfactory knowledge respecting it than the common apprehension,\r\nnamely, that it is an immense globe of fire. We have not yet learned\r\nwhat causes are in operation to maintain its undecaying fires; but our\r\nconfidence in the Divine wisdom and goodness leads us to believe, that\r\nthose causes are such as will preserve those fires from extinction, and\r\nat a nearly uniform degree of intensity. Any material change in this\r\nrespect would jeopardize the safety of the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms, which could not exist without the enlivening influence of the\r\nsolar heat, nor, indeed, were that heat any more or less intense than it\r\nis at present.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire whether the surface of the sun is in a state of actual\r\ncombustion, like burning fuel, or merely in a state of intense ignition,\r\nlike a stone heated to redness in a furnace, we shall find it most\r\nreasonable to conclude that it is in a state of ignition. If the body of\r\nthe sun were composed of combustible matter and were actually on fire,\r\nthe material of the sun would be continually wasting away, while the\r\nproducts of combustion would fill all the vast surrounding regions, and\r\nobscure the solar light. But solid bodies may attain a very intense\r\nstate of ignition, and glow with the most fervent heat, while none of\r\ntheir material is consumed, and no clouds or fumes rise to obscure their\r\nbrightness, or to impede their further emission of heat. An ignited\r\nsurface, moreover, is far better adapted than flame to the radiation of\r\nheat. Flame, when made to act in contact with the surfaces of solid\r\nbodies, heats them rapidly and powerfully; but it sends forth, or\r\n_radiates_, very little heat, compared with solid matter in a high state\r\nof ignition. These various considerations render it highly probable to\r\nmy mind, that the body of the sun is not in a state of actual\r\ncombustion, but merely in a state of high ignition.\r\n\r\nThe solar beam consists of a mixture of several different sorts of rays.\r\nFirst, there are the _calorific_ rays, which afford heat, and are\r\nentirely distinct from those which afford light, and may be separated\r\nfrom them. Secondly, there are the _colorific_ rays, which give light,\r\nconsisting of rays of seven distinct colors, namely, violet, indigo,\r\nblue, green, yellow, orange, red. These, when separated, as they may be\r\nby a glass prism, compose the _prismatic spectrum_. They appear also in\r\nthe rainbow. When united again, in due proportions, they constitute\r\nwhite light, as seen in the light of the sun. Thirdly, there are found\r\nin the solar beam a class of rays which afford neither heat nor light,\r\nbut which produce chemical changes in certain bodies exposed to their\r\ninfluence, and hence are called _chemical_ rays. Fourthly, there is\r\nstill another class, called _magnetizing_ rays, because they are capable\r\nof imparting magnetic properties to steel. These different sorts of rays\r\nare sent forth from the sun, to the remotest regions of the planetary\r\nworlds, invigorating all things by their life-giving influence, and\r\ndispelling the darkness that naturally fills all space.\r\n\r\nBut it was not alone to give heat and light, that the sun was placed in\r\nthe firmament. By his power of attraction, also, he serves as the great\r\nregulator of the planetary motions, bending them continually from the\r\nstraight line in which they tend to move, and compelling them to\r\ncirculate around him, each at nearly a uniform distance, and all in\r\nperfect harmony. I will hereafter explain to you the manner in which the\r\ngravity of the sun thus acts, to control the planetary motions. For the\r\npresent, let us content ourselves with reflecting upon the wonderful\r\nforce which the sun must put forth, in order to bend out of their\r\ncourses, into circular orbits, such a number of planets, some of which\r\nare more than a thousand times as large as the earth. Were a ship of war\r\nunder full sail, and it should be required to turn her aside from her\r\ncourse by a rope attached to her bow, we can easily imagine that it\r\nwould take a great force to do it, especially were it required that the\r\nforce should remain stationary and the ship be so constantly diverted\r\nfrom her course, as to be made to go round the force as round a centre.\r\nSomewhat similar to this is the action which the sun exerts on each of\r\nthe planets by some invisible influence, called gravitation. The bodies\r\nwhich he thus turns out of their course, and bends into a circular orbit\r\naround himself, are, however, many millions of times as ponderous as the\r\nship, and are moving many thousand times as swiftly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.\r\n\r\nANNUAL REVOLUTION.--SEASONS\r\n\r\n    \"These, as they change, Almighty Father, these\r\n    Are but the varied God. The rolling year\r\n    Is full of Thee.\"--_Thomson._\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have seen that the apparent revolution of the heavenly bodies, from\r\neast to west, every twenty-four hours, is owing to a real revolution of\r\nthe earth on its own axis, in the opposite direction. This motion is\r\nvery easily understood, resembling, as it does, the spinning of a top.\r\nWe must, however, conceive of the top as turning without any visible\r\nsupport, and not as resting in the usual manner on a plane. The annual\r\nmotion of the earth around the sun, which gives rise to an apparent\r\nmotion of the sun around the earth once a year, and occasions the change\r\nof seasons, is somewhat more difficult to understand; and it may cost\r\nyou some reflection, before you will settle all the points respecting\r\nthe changes of the seasons clearly in your mind. We sometimes see these\r\ntwo motions exemplified in a top. When, as the string is pulled, the top\r\nis thrown forwards on the floor, we may see it move forward (sometimes\r\nin a circle) at the same time that it spins on its axis. Let a candle be\r\nplaced on a table, to represent the sun, and let these two motions be\r\nimagined to be given to a top around it, and we shall have a case\r\nsomewhat resembling the actual motions of the earth around the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen bodies are at such a distance from each other as the earth and the\r\nsun, a spectator on either would project the other body upon the concave\r\nsphere of the heavens, always seeing it on the opposite side of a great\r\ncircle one hundred and eighty degrees from himself.\r\n\r\nRecollect that the path in which the earth moves round the sun is\r\ncalled the ecliptic. We are not to conceive of this, or of any other\r\ncelestial circle, as having any real, palpable existence, any more than\r\nthe path of a bird through the sky. You will perhaps think it quite\r\nsuperfluous for me to remind you of this; but, from the habit of seeing\r\nthe orbits of the heavenly bodies represented in diagrams and orreries,\r\nby palpable lines and circles, we are apt inadvertently to acquire the\r\nnotion, that the orbits of the planets, and other representations of the\r\nartificial sphere, have a real, palpable existence in Nature; whereas,\r\nthey denote the places where mere geometrical or imaginary lines run.\r\nYou might have expected to see an orrery, exhibiting a view of the sun\r\nand planets, with their various motions, particularly described in my\r\nLetter on astronomical instruments and apparatus. I must acknowledge,\r\nthat I entertain a very low opinion of the utility of even the best\r\norreries, and I cannot recommend them as auxiliaries in the study of\r\nastronomy. The numerous appendages usually connected with them, some to\r\nsupport them in a proper position, and some to communicate to them the\r\nrequisite motions, enter into the ideas which the learner forms\r\nrespecting the machinery of the heavens; and it costs much labor\r\nafterwards to divest the mind of such erroneous impressions. Astronomy\r\ncan be exhibited much more clearly and beautifully to the mental eye\r\nthan to the visual organ. It is much easier to conceive of the sun\r\nexisting in boundless space, and of the earth as moving around him at a\r\ngreat distance, the mind having nothing in view but simply these two\r\nbodies, than it is, in an orrery, to contemplate the motion of a ball\r\nrepresenting the earth, carried by a complicated apparatus of wheels\r\naround another ball, supported by a cylinder or wire, to represent the\r\nsun. I would advise you, whenever it is practicable, to think how things\r\nare in Nature, rather than how they are represented by art. The\r\nmachinery of the heavens is much simpler than that of an orrery.\r\n\r\nIn endeavoring to obtain a clear idea of the revolution of the earth\r\naround the sun, imagine to yourself a plane (a geometrical plane, having\r\nmerely length and breadth, but no thickness) passing through the centres\r\nof the sun and the earth, and extended far beyond the earth till it\r\nreaches the firmament of stars. Although, indeed, no such dome actually\r\nexists as that under which we figure to ourselves the vault of the sky,\r\nyet, as the fixed stars appear to be set in such a dome, we may imagine\r\nthat the circles of the sphere, when indefinitely enlarged, finally\r\nreach such an imaginary vault. All that is essential is, that we should\r\nimagine this to exist far beyond the bounds of the solar system, the\r\nvarious bodies that compose the latter being situated close around the\r\nsun, at the centre.\r\n\r\nAlong the line where this great circle meets the starry vault, are\r\nsituated a series of constellations,--Aries, Taurus, Gemini, &c.,--which\r\noccupy successively this portion of the heavens. When bodies are at such\r\na distance from each other as the sun and the earth, I have said that a\r\nspectator on either would project the other body upon the concave sphere\r\nof the heavens, always seeing it on the opposite side of a great circle\r\none hundred and eighty degrees from himself. The place of a body, when\r\nviewed from any point, is denoted by the position it occupies among the\r\nstars. Thus, in the diagram, Fig. 25, page 114, when the earth arrives\r\nat E, it is said to be in Aries, because, if viewed from the sun, it\r\nwould be projected on that part of the heavens; and, for the same\r\nreason, to a spectator at E, the sun would be in Libra. When the earth\r\nshifts its position from Aries to Taurus, as we are unconscious of our\r\nown motion, the sun it is that appears to move from Libra to Scorpio, in\r\nthe opposite part of the heavens. Hence, as we go forward, in the order\r\nof the signs, on one side of the ecliptic, the sun seems to be moving\r\nforward at the same rate on the opposite side of the same great circle;\r\nand therefore, although we are unconscious of our own motion, we can\r\nread it, from day to day, in the motions of the sun. If we could see\r\nthe stars at the same time with the sun, we could actually observe, from\r\nday to day, the sun's progress through them, as we observe the progress\r\nof the moon at night; only the sun's rate of motion would be nearly\r\nfourteen times slower than that of the moon. Although we do not see the\r\nstars when the sun is present, we can observe that it makes daily\r\nprogress eastward, as is apparent from the constellations of the zodiac\r\noccupying, successively, the western sky immediately after sunset,\r\nproving that either all the stars have a common motion westward,\r\nindependent of their diurnal motion, or that the sun has a motion past\r\nthem from west to east. We shall see, hereafter, abundant evidence to\r\nprove, that this change in the relative position of the sun and stars,\r\nis owing to a change in the apparent place of the sun, and not to any\r\nchange in the stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\nTo form a clear idea of the two motions of the earth, imagine yourself\r\nstanding on a circular platform which turns slowly round its centre.\r\nWhile you are carried slowly round the entire of the circuit of the\r\nheavens, along with the platform, you may turn round upon your heel the\r\nsame way three hundred and sixty-five times. The former is analogous to\r\nour annual motion with the earth around the sun; the latter, to our\r\ndiurnal revolution in common with the earth around its own axis.\r\n\r\nAlthough the apparent revolution of the sun is in a direction opposite\r\nto the real motion of the earth, as regards absolute space, yet both are\r\nnevertheless from west to east, since these terms do not refer to any\r\ndirections in absolute space, but to the order in which certain\r\nconstellations (the constellations of the Zodiac) succeed one another.\r\nThe earth itself, on opposite sides of its orbit, does in fact move\r\ntowards directly opposite points of space; but it is all the while\r\npursuing its course in the order of the signs. In the same manner,\r\nalthough the earth turns on its axis from west to east, yet any place on\r\nthe surface of the earth is moving in a direction in space exactly\r\nopposite to its direction twelve hours before. If the sun left a visible\r\ntrace on the face of the sky, the ecliptic would of course be distinctly\r\nmarked on the celestial sphere, as it is on an artificial globe; and\r\nwere the equator delineated in a similar manner, we should then see, at\r\na glance, the relative position of these two circles,--the points where\r\nthey intersect one another, constituting the equinoxes; the points where\r\nthey are at the greatest distance asunder, that is, the solstices; and\r\nvarious other particulars, which, for want of such visible traces, we\r\nare now obliged to search for by indirect and circuitous methods. It\r\nwill aid you, to have constantly before your mental vision an imaginary\r\ndelineation of these two important circles on the face of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe equator makes an angle with the ecliptic of twenty-three degrees and\r\ntwenty-eight minutes. This is called the obliquity of the ecliptic. As\r\nthe sun and earth are both always in the ecliptic, and as the motion of\r\nthe earth in one part of it makes the sun appear to move in the\r\nopposite part, at the same rate, the sun apparently descends, in Winter,\r\ntwenty-three degrees and twenty-eight minutes to the south of the\r\nequator, and ascends, in Summer, the same number of degrees north of it.\r\nWe must keep in mind, that the celestial equator and celestial ecliptic\r\nare here understood, and we may imagine them to be two great circles\r\ndelineated on the face of the sky. On comparing observations made at\r\ndifferent periods, for more than two thousand years, it is found, that\r\nthe obliquity of the ecliptic is not constant, but that it undergoes a\r\nslight diminution, from age to age, amounting to fifty-two seconds in a\r\ncentury, or about half a second annually. We might apprehend that, by\r\nsuccessive approaches to each other, the equator and ecliptic would\r\nfinally coincide; but astronomers have discovered, by a most profound\r\ninvestigation, based on the principles of universal gravitation, that\r\nthis irregularity is confined within certain narrow limits; and that the\r\nobliquity, after diminishing for some thousands of years, will then\r\nincrease for a similar period, and will thus vibrate forever about a\r\nmean value.\r\n\r\nAs the earth traverses every part of her orbit in the course of a year,\r\nshe will be once at each solstice, and once at each equinox. The best\r\nway of obtaining a correct idea of her two motions is, to conceive of\r\nher as standing still for a single day, at some point in her orbit,\r\nuntil she has turned once on her axis, then moving about a degree, and\r\nhalting again, until another diurnal revolution is completed. Let us\r\nsuppose the earth at the Autumnal equinox, the sun, of course, being at\r\nthe Vernal equinox,--for we must always think of these two bodies as\r\ndiametrically opposite to each other. Suppose the earth to stand still\r\nin its orbit for twenty-four hours. The revolution of the earth on its\r\naxis, from west to east, will make the sun appear to describe a great\r\ncircle of the heavens from east to west, coinciding with the equator. At\r\nthe end of this period, suppose the sun to move northward one degree,\r\nand to remain there for twenty-four hours; in which time, the\r\nrevolution of the earth, will make the sun appear to describe another\r\ncircle, from east to west, parallel to the equator, but one degree north\r\nof it. Thus, we may conceive of the sun as moving one degree north,\r\nevery day, for about three months, when it will reach the point of the\r\necliptic furthest from the equator, which point is called the _tropic_,\r\nfrom a Greek word, signifying _to turn_; because, after the sun has\r\npassed this point, his motion in his orbit carries him continually\r\ntowards the equator, and therefore he seems to turn about. The same\r\npoint is also called the _solstice_, from a Latin word, signifying to\r\n_stand still_; since, when the sun has reached its greatest northern or\r\nsouthern limit, while its declination is at the point where it ceases to\r\nincrease, but begins to decrease, there the sun seems for a short time\r\nstationary, with regard to the equator, appearing for several days to\r\ndescribe the same parallel of latitude.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun is at the northern tropic, which happens about the\r\ntwenty-first of June, his elevation above the southern horizon at noon\r\nis the greatest in the year; and when he is at the southern tropic,\r\nabout the twenty-first of December, his elevation at noon is the least\r\nin the year. The difference between these two meridian altitudes will\r\ngive the whole distance from one tropic to the other, and consequently,\r\ntwice the distance from each tropic to the equator. By this means, we\r\nfind how far the tropic is from the equator, and that gives us the angle\r\nwhich the equator and ecliptic make with each other; for the greatest\r\ndistance between any two great circles on the sphere is always equal to\r\nthe angle which they make with each other. Thus, the ancient astronomers\r\nwere able to determine the obliquity of the ecliptic with a great degree\r\nof accuracy. It was easy to find the situation of the zenith, because\r\nthe direction of a plumb-line shows us where that is; and it was easy to\r\nfind the distances from the zenith where the sun was at the greatest and\r\nleast distances; respectively. The difference of these two arcs is the\r\nangular distance from one tropic to the other; and half this arc is the\r\ndistance of either tropic from the equator, and of course, equal to the\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic. All this will be very easily understood from\r\nthe annexed diagram, Fig. 26. Let Z be the zenith of a spectator\r\nsituated at C; Z _n_ the least, and Z _s_ the greatest distance of the\r\nsun from the zenith. From Z _s_ subtract Z _n_, and then _s n_, the\r\ndifference, divided by two, will give the obliquity of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe motion of the earth in its orbit is nearly seventy times as great as\r\nits greatest motion around its axis. In its revolution around the sun,\r\nthe earth moves no less than one million six hundred and forty thousand\r\nmiles per day, sixty-eight thousand miles per hour, eleven hundred miles\r\nper minute, and nearly nineteen miles every second; a velocity nearly\r\nsixty times as great as the greatest velocity of a cannon ball. Places\r\non the earth turn with very different degrees of velocity in different\r\nlatitudes. Those near the equator are carried round on the circumference\r\nof a large circle; those towards the poles, on the circumference of a\r\nsmall circle; while one standing on the pole itself would not turn at\r\nall. Those who live on the equator are carried about one thousand miles\r\nan hour. In our latitude, (forty-one degrees and eighteen minutes,) the\r\ndiurnal velocity is about seven hundred and fifty miles per hour. It\r\nwould seem, at first view, quite incredible, that we should be whirled\r\nround at so rapid a rate, and yet be entirely insensible of any motion;\r\nand much more, that we could be going so swiftly through space, in our\r\ncircuit around the sun, while all things, when unaffected by local\r\ncauses, appear to be in such a state of quiescence. Yet we have the most\r\nunquestionable evidence of the fact; nor is it difficult to account for\r\nit, in consistency with the general state of repose among bodies on the\r\nearth, when we reflect that their relative motions, with respect to each\r\nother, are not in the least disturbed by any motions which they may have\r\nin common. When we are on board a steam-boat, we move about in the same\r\nmanner when the boat is in rapid motion, as when it is lying still; and\r\nsuch would be the case, if it moved steadily a hundred times faster than\r\nit does. Were the earth, however, suddenly to stop its diurnal\r\nrevolution, all movable bodies on its surface would be thrown off in\r\ntangents to the surface with velocities proportional to that of their\r\ndiurnal motion; and were the earth suddenly to halt in its orbit, we\r\nshould be hurled forward into space with inconceivable rapidity.\r\n\r\nI will next endeavor to explain to you the phenomena of the _Seasons_.\r\nThese depend on two causes; first, the inclination of the earth's axis\r\nto the plane of its orbit; and, secondly, to the circumstance, that the\r\naxis always remains parallel to itself. Imagine to yourself a candle\r\nplaced in the centre of a ring, to represent the sun in the centre of\r\nthe earth's orbit, and an apple with a knittingneedle running through it\r\nin the direction of the stem. Run a knife around the central part of the\r\napple, to mark the situation of the equator. The circumference of the\r\nring represents the earth's orbit in the plane of the ecliptic. Place\r\nthe apple so that the equator shall coincide with the wire; then the\r\naxis will lie directly across the plane of the ecliptic; that is, at\r\nright angles to it. Let the apple be carried quite round the ring,\r\nconstantly preserving the axis parallel to itself, and the equator all\r\nthe while coinciding with the wire that represents the orbit. Now, since\r\nthe sun enlightens half the globe at once, so the candle, which here\r\nrepresents the sun, will shine on the half of the apple that is turned\r\ntowards it; and the circle which divides the enlightened from the\r\nunenlightened side of the apple, called the _terminator_, will pass\r\nthrough both the poles. If the apple be turned slowly round on its axis,\r\nthe terminator will successively pass over all places on the earth,\r\ngiving the appearance of sunrise to places at which it arrives, and of\r\nsunset to places from which it departs. If, therefore, the equator had\r\ncoincided with the ecliptic, as would have been the case, had the\r\nearth's axis been perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, the diurnal\r\nmotion of the sun would always have been in the equator, and the days\r\nand nights would have been equal all over the globe. To the inhabitants\r\nof the equatorial parts of the earth, the sun would always have appeared\r\nto move in the prime vertical, rising directly in the east, passing\r\nthrough the zenith at noon, and setting in the west. In the polar\r\nregions, the sun would always have appeared to revolve in the horizon;\r\nwhile, at any place between the equator and the pole, the course of the\r\nsun would have been oblique to the horizon, but always oblique in the\r\nsame degree. There would have been nothing of those agreeable\r\nvicissitudes of the seasons which we now enjoy; but some regions of the\r\nearth would have been crowned with perpetual spring, others would have\r\nbeen scorched with the unremitting fervor of a vertical sun, while\r\nextensive regions towards either pole would have been consigned to\r\neverlasting frost and sterility.\r\n\r\nTo understand, then, clearly, the causes of the change of seasons, use\r\nthe same apparatus as before; but, instead of placing the axis of the\r\nearth at right angles to the plane of its orbit, turn it out of a\r\nperpendicular position a little, (twenty-three degrees and twenty-eight\r\nminutes,) then the equator will be turned just the same number of\r\ndegrees out of a coincidence with the ecliptic. Let the apple be carried\r\naround the ring, always holding the axis inclined at the same angle to\r\nthe plane of the ring, and always parallel to itself. You will find that\r\nthere will be two points in the circuit where the plane of the equator,\r\nthat you had marked around the centre of the apple, will pass through\r\nthe centre of the sun; these will be the points where the celestial\r\nequator and the ecliptic cut one another, or the equinoxes. When the\r\nearth is at either of these points, the sun shines on both poles alike;\r\nand, if we conceive of the earth, while in this situation, as turning\r\nonce round on its axis, the apparent diurnal motion of the sun will be\r\nthe same as it would be, were the earth's axis perpendicular to the\r\nplane of the equator. For that day, the sun would revolve in the\r\nequator, and the days and nights would be equal all over the globe. If\r\nthe apple were carried round in the manner supposed, then, at the\r\ndistance of ninety degrees from the equinoxes, the same pole would be\r\nturned from the sun on one side, just as much as it was turned towards\r\nhim on the other. In the former case, the sun's light would fall short\r\nof the pole twenty-three and one half degrees, and in the other case, it\r\nwould reach beyond it the same number of degrees. I would recommend to\r\nyou to obtain as clear an idea as you can of the cause of the change of\r\nseasons, by thinking over the foregoing illustration. You may then clear\r\nup any remaining difficulties, by studying the diagram, Fig. 27, on page\r\n122.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\nLet A B C D represent the earth's place in different parts of its orbit,\r\nhaving the sun in the centre. Let A, C, be the positions of the earth at\r\nthe equinoxes, and B, D, its positions at the tropics,--the axis _n s_\r\nbeing always parallel to itself. It is difficult to represent things of\r\nthis kind correctly, all on the same plane; but you will readily see,\r\nthat the figure of the earth, here, answers to the apple in the former\r\nillustration; that the hemisphere towards _n_ is above, and that towards\r\n_s_ is below, the plane of the paper. When the earth is at A and C, the\r\nVernal and Autumnal equinoxes, the sun, you will perceive, shines on\r\nboth the poles _n_ and _s_; and, if you conceive of the globe, while in\r\nthis position, as turned round on its axis, as it is in the diurnal\r\nrevolution, you will readily understand, that the sun would describe the\r\ncelestial equator. This may not at first appear so obvious, by\r\ninspecting the figure; but if you consider the point _n_ as raised above\r\nthe plane of the paper, and the point _s_ as depressed below it, you\r\nwill readily see how the plane of the equator would pass through the\r\ncentre of the sun. Again, at B, when the earth is at the southern\r\ntropic, the sun shines twenty-three and a half degrees beyond the north\r\npole, _n_, and falls the same distance short of the south pole, _s_. The\r\ncase is exactly reversed when the earth is at the northern tropic, and\r\nthe sun at the southern. While the earth is at one of the tropics, at B,\r\nfor example, let us conceive of it as turning on its axis, and we shall\r\nreadily see, that all that part of the earth which lies within the north\r\npolar circle will enjoy continual day, while that within the south polar\r\ncircle will have continual night; and that all other places will have\r\ntheir days longer as they are nearer to the enlightened pole, and\r\nshorter as they are nearer to the unenlightened pole. This figure\r\nlikewise shows the successive positions of the earth, at different\r\nperiods of the year, with respect to the signs, and what months\r\ncorrespond to particular signs. Thus, the earth enters Libra, and the\r\nsun Aries, on the twenty-first of March, and on the twenty-first of\r\nJune, the earth is just entering Capricorn, and the sun, Cancer. You\r\nwill call to mind what is meant by this phraseology,--that by saying the\r\nearth enters Libra, we mean that a spectator placed on the sun would see\r\nthe earth in that part of the celestial ecliptic, which is occupied by\r\nthe sign Libra; and that a spectator on the earth sees the sun at the\r\nsame time projected on the opposite part of the heavens, occupied by the\r\nsign Cancer.\r\n\r\nHad the axis of the earth been perpendicular to the plane of the\r\necliptic, then the sun would always have appeared to move in the\r\nequator, the days would every where have been equal to the nights, and\r\nthere could have been no change of seasons. On the other hand, had the\r\ninclination of the ecliptic to the equator been much greater than it is,\r\nthe vicissitudes of the seasons would have been proportionally greater,\r\nthan at present. Suppose, for instance, the equator had been at right\r\nangles to the ecliptic, in which case, the poles of the earth would have\r\nbeen situated in the ecliptic itself; then, in different parts of the\r\nearth, the appearances would have been as follows: To a spectator on the\r\n_equator_, (where all the circles of diurnal revolution are\r\nperpendicular to the horizon,) the sun, as he left the vernal equinox,\r\nwould every day perform his diurnal revolution in a smaller and smaller\r\ncircle, until he reached the north pole, when he would halt for a\r\nmoment, and then wheel about and return to the equator, in a reverse\r\norder. The progress of the sun through the southern signs, to the south\r\npole, would be similar to that already described. Such would be the\r\nappearances to an inhabitant of the equatorial regions. To a spectator\r\nliving in an _oblique_ sphere, in our own latitude, for example, the\r\nsun, while north of the equator, would advance continually northward,\r\nmaking his diurnal circuit in parallels further and further distant from\r\nthe equator, until he reached the circle of perpetual apparition; after\r\nwhich, he would climb, by a spiral course, to the north star, and then\r\nas rapidly return to the equator. By a similar progress southward, the\r\nsun would at length pass the circle of perpetual occultation, and for\r\nsome time (which would be longer or shorter, according to the latitude\r\nof the place of observation) there would be continual night. To a\r\nspectator on the _pole_ of the earth and under the pole of the heaven,\r\nduring the long day of six months, the sun would wind its way to a point\r\ndirectly over head, pouring down upon the earth beneath not merely the\r\nheat of the torrid zone, but the heat of a torrid noon, accumulating\r\nwithout intermission.\r\n\r\nThe great vicissitudes of heat and cold, which would attend these\r\nseveral movements of the sun, would be wholly incompatible with the\r\nexistence of either the animal or the vegetable kingdom, and all\r\nterrestrial Nature would be doomed to perpetual sterility and\r\ndesolation. The happy provision which the Creator has made against such\r\nextreme vicissitudes, by confining the changes of the seasons within\r\nsuch narrow bounds, conspires with many other express arrangements in\r\nthe economy of Nature, to secure the safety and comfort of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have never reflected upon all the reasons, why the several\r\nchanges of position, with respect to the horizon, which the sun\r\nundergoes in the course of the year, occasion such a difference in the\r\namount of heat received from him. Two causes contribute to increase the\r\nheat of Summer and the cold of Winter. The higher the sun ascends above\r\nthe horizon, the more directly his rays fall upon the earth; and their\r\nheating power is rapidly augmented, as they approach a perpendicular\r\ndirection. When the sun is nearly over head, his rays strike us with far\r\ngreater force than when they meet us obliquely; and the earth absorbs a\r\nfar greater number of those rays of heat which strike it\r\nperpendicularly, than of those which meet it in a slanting direction.\r\nWhen the sun is near the horizon, his rays merely glance along the\r\nground, and many of them, before they reach it, are absorbed and\r\ndispersed in passing through the atmosphere. Those who have felt only\r\nthe oblique solar rays, as they fall upon objects in the high latitudes,\r\nhave a very inadequate idea of the power of a vertical, noonday sun, as\r\nfelt in the region of the equator.\r\n\r\nThe increased length of the day in Summer is another cause of the heat\r\nof this season of the year. This cause more sensibly affects places far\r\nremoved from the equator, because at such places the days are longer and\r\nthe nights shorter than in the torrid zone. By the operation of this\r\ncause, the solar heat accumulates there so much, during the longest days\r\nof Summer, that the temperature rises to a higher degree than is often\r\nknown in the torrid climates.\r\n\r\nBut the temperature of a place is influenced very much by several other\r\ncauses, as well as by the force and duration of the sun's heat. First,\r\nthe _elevation_ of a country above the level of the sea has a great\r\ninfluence upon its climate. Elevated districts of country, even in the\r\ntorrid zone, often enjoy the most agreeable climate in the world. The\r\ncold of the upper regions of the atmosphere modifies and tempers the\r\nsolar heat, so as to give a most delightful softness, while the\r\nuniformity of temperature excludes those sudden and excessive changes\r\nwhich are often experienced in less favored climes. In ascending certain\r\nhigh mountains situated within the torrid zone, the traveller passes, in\r\na short time, through every variety of climate, from the most oppressive\r\nand sultry heat, to the soft and balmy air of Spring, which again is\r\nsucceeded by the cooler breezes of Autumn, and then by the severest\r\nfrosts of Winter. A corresponding difference is seen in the products of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom. While Winter reigns on the summit of the\r\nmountain, its central regions may be encircled with the verdure of\r\nSpring, and its base with the flowers and fruits of Summer. Secondly,\r\nthe proximity of the _ocean_ also has a great effect to equalize the\r\ntemperature of a place. As the ocean changes its temperature during the\r\nyear much less than the land, it becomes a source of warmth to\r\ncontiguous countries in Winter, and a fountain of cool breezes in\r\nSummer. Thirdly, the relative _humidity_ or _dryness_ of the atmosphere\r\nof a place is of great importance, in regard to its effects on the\r\nanimal system. A dry air of ninety degrees is not so insupportable as a\r\nhumid air of eighty degrees; and it may be asserted as a general\r\nprinciple, that a hot and humid atmosphere is unhealthy, although a hot\r\nair, when dry, may be very salubrious. In a warm atmosphere which is\r\ndry, the evaporation of moisture from the surface of the body is rapid,\r\nand its cooling influence affords a most striking relief to an intense\r\nheat without; but when the surrounding atmosphere is already filled with\r\nmoisture, no such evaporation takes place from the surface of the skin,\r\nand no such refreshing effects are experienced from this cause. Moisture\r\ncollects on the skin; a sultry, oppressive sensation is felt; and chills\r\nand fevers are usually in the train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.\r\n\r\nLAWS OF MOTION.\r\n\r\n    \"What though in solemn silence, all\r\n    Move round this dark, terrestrial ball!\r\n    In reason's ear they all rejoice,\r\n    And utter forth a glorious voice;\r\n    For ever singing, as they shine,\r\n    'The hand that made us is divine.'\"--_Addison._\r\n\r\n\r\nHOWEVER incredible it may seem, no fact is more certain, than that the\r\nearth is constantly on the wing, flying around the sun with a velocity\r\nso prodigious, that, for every breath we draw, we advance on our way\r\nforty or fifty miles. If, when passing across the waters in a\r\nsteam-boat, we can wake, after a night's repose, and find ourselves\r\nconducted on our voyage a hundred miles, we exult in the triumphs of\r\nart, which could have moved so ponderous a body as a steam-ship over\r\nsuch a space in so short a time, and so quietly, too, as not to disturb\r\nour slumbers; but, with a motion vastly more quiet and uniform, we have,\r\nin the same interval, been carried along with the earth in its orbit\r\nmore than half a million of miles. In the case of the steam-ship,\r\nhowever perfect the machinery may be, we still, in our waking hours at\r\nleast, are made sensible of the action of the forces by which the motion\r\nis maintained,--as the roaring of the fire, the beating of the piston,\r\nand the dashing of the paddle-wheels; but in the more perfect machinery\r\nwhich carries the earth forward on her grander voyage, no sound is\r\nheard, nor the least intimation afforded of the stupendous forces by\r\nwhich this motion is achieved. To the pious observer of Nature it might\r\nseem sufficient, without any inquiry into second causes, to ascribe the\r\nmotions of the spheres to the direct agency of the Supreme Being. If,\r\nhowever, we can succeed in finding the secret springs and cords, by\r\nwhich the motions of the heavenly bodies are immediately produced and\r\ncontrolled, it will detract nothing from our just admiration of the\r\nGreat First Cause of all things. We may therefore now enter upon the\r\ninquiry into the nature or laws of the forces by which the earth is made\r\nto revolve on her axis and in her orbit; and having learned what it is,\r\nthat causes and maintains the motions of the earth, you will then\r\nacquire, at the same time, a knowledge of all the celestial machinery.\r\nThe subject will involve an explanation of the laws of motion, and of\r\nthe principles of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nIt was once supposed, that we could never reason respecting the laws\r\nthat govern the heavenly bodies from what we observe in bodies around\r\nus, but that motion is one thing on the earth and quite another thing in\r\nthe skies; and hence, that it is impossible for us, by any inquiries\r\ninto the laws of terrestrial Nature, to ascertain how things take place\r\namong the heavenly bodies. Galileo and Newton, however, proceeded on the\r\ncontrary supposition, that Nature is uniform in all her works; that the\r\nsame Almighty arm rules over all; and that He works by the same fixed\r\nlaws through all parts of His boundless realm. The certainty with which\r\nall the predictions of astronomers, made on these suppositions, are\r\nfulfilled, attests the soundness of the hypothesis. Accordingly, those\r\nlaws, which all experience, endlessly multiplied and varied, proves to\r\nbe the laws of terrestrial motion, are held to be the laws that govern\r\nalso the motions of the most distant planets and stars, and to prevail\r\nthroughout the universe of matter. Let us, then, briefly review these\r\ngreat laws of motion, which are three in number. The FIRST LAW is as\r\nfollows: _every body perseveres in a state of rest, or of uniform motion\r\nin a straight line, unless compelled by some force to change its state_.\r\nBy _force_ is meant any thing which produces motion.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing law has been fully established by experiment, and is\r\nconformable to all experience. It embraces several particulars. First, a\r\nbody, when at rest, remains so, unless some force puts it in motion; and\r\nhence it is inferred, when a body is found in motion, that some force\r\nmust have been applied to it sufficient to have caused its motion. Thus,\r\nthe fact, that the earth is in motion around the sun and around its own\r\naxis, is to be accounted for by assigning to each of these motions a\r\nforce adequate, both in quantity and direction, to produce these\r\nmotions, respectively.\r\n\r\nSecondly, when a body is once in motion, it will continue to move for\r\never, unless something stops it. When a ball is struck on the surface of\r\nthe earth, the friction of the earth and the resistance of the air soon\r\nstop its motion; when struck on smooth ice, it will go much further\r\nbefore it comes to a state of rest, because the ice opposes much less\r\nresistance than the ground; and, were there no impediment to its\r\nmotion, it would, when once set in motion, continue to move without\r\nend. The heavenly bodies are actually in this condition: they continue\r\nto move, not because any new forces are applied to them; but, having\r\nbeen once set in motion, they continue in motion because there is\r\nnothing to stop them. This property in bodies to persevere in the state\r\nthey are actually in,--if at rest, to remain at rest, or, if in motion,\r\nto continue in motion,--is called _inertia_. The inertia of a body\r\n(which is measured by the force required to overcome it) is proportioned\r\nto the quantity of matter it contains. A steam-boat manifests its\r\ninertia, on first starting it, by the enormous expenditure of force\r\nrequired to bring it to a given rate of motion; and it again manifests\r\nits inertia, when in rapid motion, by the great difficulty of stopping\r\nit. The heavenly bodies, having been once put in motion, and meeting\r\nwith nothing to stop them, move on by their own inertia. A top affords a\r\nbeautiful illustration of inertia, continuing, as it does, to spin after\r\nthe moving force is withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the motion to which a body naturally tends is _uniform_; that\r\nis, the body moves just as far the second minute as it did the first,\r\nand as far the third as the second; and passes over equal spaces in\r\nequal times. I do not assert that the motion of all moving bodies is _in\r\nfact_ uniform, but that such is their _tendency_. If it is otherwise\r\nthan uniform, there is some cause operating to disturb the uniformity to\r\nwhich it is naturally prone.\r\n\r\nFourthly, a body in motion will move in a _straight line_, unless\r\ndiverted out of that line by some external force; and the body will\r\nresume its straight-forward motion, whenever the force that turns it\r\naside is withdrawn. Every body that is revolving in an orbit, like the\r\nmoon around the earth, or the earth around the sun, _tends_ to move in a\r\nstraight line which is a tangent[7] to its orbit. Thus, if A B C, Fig.\r\n28, represents the orbit of the moon around the earth, were it not for\r\nthe constant action of some force that draws her towards the earth, she\r\nwould move off in a straight line. If the force that carries her towards\r\nthe earth were suspended at A, she would immediately desert the circular\r\nmotion, and proceed in the direction A D. In the same manner, a boy\r\nwhirls a stone around his head in a sling, and then letting go one of\r\nthe strings, and releasing the force that binds it to the circle, it\r\nflies off in a straight line which is a tangent to that part of the\r\ncircle where it was released. This tendency which a body revolving in an\r\norbit exhibits, to recede from the centre and to fly off in a tangent,\r\nis called the _centrifugal force_. We see it manifested when a pail of\r\nwater is whirled. The water rises on the sides of the vessel, leaving a\r\nhollow in the central parts. We see an example of the effects of\r\ncentrifugal action, when a horse turns swiftly round a corner, and the\r\nrider is thrown outwards; also, when a wheel passes rapidly through a\r\nsmall collection of water, and portions of the water are thrown off from\r\nthe top of the wheel in straight lines which are tangents to the wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe centrifugal force is increased as the velocity is increased. Thus,\r\nthe parts of a millstone most remote from the centre sometimes acquire a\r\ncentrifugal force so much greater than the central parts, which move\r\nmuch slower, that the stone is divided, and the exterior portions are\r\nprojected with great violence. In like manner, as the equatorial parts\r\nof the earth, in the diurnal revolution, revolve much faster than the\r\nparts towards the poles, so the centrifugal force is felt most at the\r\nequator, and becomes strikingly manifest by the diminished weight of\r\nbodies, since it acts in opposition to the force of gravity.\r\n\r\nAlthough the foregoing law of motion, when first presented to the mind,\r\nappears to convey no new truth, but only to enunciate in a formal manner\r\nwhat we knew before; yet a just understanding of this law, in all its\r\nbearings, leads us to a clear comprehension of no small share of all the\r\nphenomena of motion. The second and third laws may be explained in fewer\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThe SECOND LAW of motion is as follows: _motion is proportioned to the\r\nforce impressed, and in the direction of that force_.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this law is, that every force that is applied to a body\r\nproduces its full effect, proportioned to its intensity, either in\r\ncausing or in preventing motion. Let there be ever so many blows applied\r\nat once to a ball, each will produce its own effect in its own\r\ndirection, and the ball will move off, not indeed in the zigzag, complex\r\nlines corresponding to the directions of the several forces, but in a\r\nsingle line expressing the united effect of all. If you place a ball at\r\nthe corner of a table, and give it an impulse, at the same instant, with\r\nthe thumb and finger of each hand, one impelling it in the direction of\r\none side of the table, and the other in the direction of the other side,\r\nthe ball will move diagonally across the table. If the blows be exactly\r\nproportioned each to the length of the side of the table on which it is\r\ndirected, the ball will run exactly from corner to corner, and in the\r\nsame time that it would have passed over each side by the blow given in\r\nthe direction of that side. This principle is expressed by saying, that\r\na body impelled by two forces, acting respectively in the directions of\r\nthe two sides of a parallelogram, and proportioned in intensity to the\r\nlengths of the sides, will describe the diagonal of the parallelogram in\r\nthe same time in which it would have described the sides by the forces\r\nacting separately.\r\n\r\nThe converse of this proposition is also true, namely, that any single\r\nmotion may be considered as the _resultant_ of two others,--the motion\r\nitself being represented by the diagonal, while the two _components_ are\r\nrepresented by the sides, of a parallelogram. This reduction of a motion\r\nto the individual motions that produce it, is called the _resolution of\r\nmotion_, or the _resolution of forces_. Nor can a given motion be\r\nresolved into _two_ components, merely. These, again, may be resolved\r\ninto others, varying indefinitely, in direction and intensity, from all\r\nwhich the given motion may be considered as having resulted. This\r\ncomposition and resolution of motion or forces is often of great use, in\r\ninquiries into the motions of the heavenly bodies. The composition often\r\nenables us to substitute a single force for a great number of others,\r\nwhose individual operations would be too complicated to be followed. By\r\nthis means, the investigation is greatly simplified. On the other hand,\r\nit is frequently very convenient to resolve a given motion into two or\r\nmore others, some of which may be thrown out of the account, as not\r\ninfluencing the particular point which we are inquiring about, while\r\nothers are far more easily understood and managed than the single force\r\nwould have been. It is characteristic of great minds, to simplify these\r\ninquiries. They gain an insight into complicated and difficult subjects,\r\nnot so much by any extraordinary faculty of seeing in the dark, as by\r\nthe power of removing from the object all incidental causes of\r\nobscurity, until it shines in its own clear and simple light.\r\n\r\nIf every force, when applied to a body, produces its full and legitimate\r\neffect, how many other forces soever may act upon it, impelling it\r\ndifferent ways, then it must follow, that the smallest force ought to\r\nmove the largest body; and such is in fact the case. A snap of a finger\r\nupon a seventy-four under full sail, if applied in the direction of its\r\nmotion, would actually increase its speed, although the effect might be\r\ntoo small to be visible. Still it is something, and may be truly\r\nexpressed by a fraction. Thus, suppose a globe, weighing a million of\r\npounds, were suspended from the ceiling by a string, and we should apply\r\nto it the snap of a finger,--it is granted that the motion would be\r\nquite insensible. Let us then divide the body into a million equal\r\nparts, each weighing one pound; then the same impulse, applied to each\r\none separately, would produce a sensible effect, moving it, say one\r\ninch. It will be found, on trial, that the same impulse given to a mass\r\nof two pounds will move it half an inch; and hence it is inferred, that,\r\nif applied to a mass weighing a million of pounds, it would move it the\r\nmillionth part of an inch.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the curious results of the second law of motion, that an\r\nunlimited number of motions may exist together in the same body. Thus,\r\nat the same moment, we may be walking around a post in the cabin of a\r\nsteam-boat, accompanying the boat in its passage around an island,\r\nrevolving with the earth on its axis, flying through space in our annual\r\ncircuit around the sun, and possibly wheeling, along with the sun and\r\nhis whole retinue of planets, around some centre in common with the\r\nstarry worlds.\r\n\r\nThe THIRD LAW of motion is this: _action and reaction are equal, and in\r\ncontrary directions_.\r\n\r\nWhenever I give a blow, the body struck exerts an equal force on the\r\nstriking body. If I strike the water with an oar, the water communicates\r\nan equal impulse to the oar, which, being communicated to the boat,\r\ndrives it forward in the opposite direction. If a magnet attracts a\r\npiece of iron, the iron attracts the magnet just as much, in the\r\nopposite direction; and, in short, every portion of matter in the\r\nuniverse attracts and is attracted by every other, equally, in an\r\nopposite direction. This brings us to the doctrine of universal\r\ngravitation, which is the very key that unlocks all the secrets of the\r\nskies. This will form the subject of my next Letter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] A tangent is a straight line touching a circle, as A D, in Fig. 28\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTERRESTRIAL GRAVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"To Him no high, no low, no great, no small,\r\n    He fills, He bounds, connects, and equals all.\"--_Pope._\r\n\r\nWE discover in Nature a tendency of every portion of matter towards\r\nevery other. This tendency is called _gravitation_. In obedience to this\r\npower, a stone falls to the ground, and a planet revolves around the\r\nsun. We may contemplate this subject as it relates either to phenomena\r\nthat take place near the surface of the earth, or in the celestial\r\nregions. The former, _gravity_, is exemplified by falling bodies; the\r\nlatter, _universal gravitation_, by the motions of the heavenly bodies.\r\nThe laws of terrestrial gravity were first investigated by Galileo;\r\nthose of universal gravitation, by Sir Isaac Newton. Terrestrial gravity\r\nis only an individual example of universal gravitation; being the\r\ntendency of bodies towards the centre of the earth. We are so much\r\naccustomed, from our earliest years, to see bodies fall to the earth,\r\nthat we imagine bodies must of necessity fall \"downwards;\" but when we\r\nreflect that the earth is round, and that bodies fall towards the centre\r\non all sides of it, and that of course bodies on opposite sides of the\r\nearth fall in precisely opposite directions, and towards each other, we\r\nperceive that there must be some force acting to produce this effect;\r\nnor is it enough to say, as the ancients did, that bodies \"naturally\"\r\nfall to the earth. Every motion implies some force which produces it;\r\nand the fact that bodies fall towards the earth, on all sides of it,\r\nleads us to infer that that force, whatever it is, resides in the earth\r\nitself. We therefore call it _attraction_. We do not, however, say what\r\nattraction _is_, but what it _does_. We must bear in mind, also, that,\r\naccording to the third law of motion, this attraction is mutual; that\r\nwhen a stone falls towards the earth, it exerts the same force on the\r\nearth that the earth exerts on the stone; but the motion of the earth\r\ntowards the stone is as much less than that of the stone towards the\r\nearth, as its quantity of matter is greater; and therefore its motion is\r\nquite insensible.\r\n\r\nBut although we are compelled to acknowledge the _existence_ of such a\r\nforce as gravity, causing a tendency in all bodies towards each other,\r\nyet we know nothing of its _nature_, nor can we conceive by what medium\r\nbodies at such a distance as the moon and the earth exercise this\r\ninfluence on each other. Still, we may trace the modes in which this\r\nforce acts; that is, its _laws_; for the laws of Nature are nothing else\r\nthan the modes in which the powers of Nature act.\r\n\r\nWe owe chiefly to the great Galileo the first investigation of the laws\r\nof terrestrial gravity, as exemplified in falling bodies; and I will\r\navail myself of this opportunity to make you better acquainted with one\r\nof the most interesting of men and greatest of philosophers.\r\n\r\nGalileo was born at Pisa, in Italy, in the year 1564. He was the son of\r\na Florentine nobleman, and was destined by his father for the medical\r\nprofession, and to this his earlier studies were devoted. But a fondness\r\nand a genius for mechanical inventions had developed itself, at a very\r\nearly age, in the construction of his toys, and a love of drawing; and\r\nas he grew older, a passion for mathematics, and for experimental\r\nresearch, predominated over his zeal for the study of medicine, and he\r\nfortunately abandoned that for the more congenial pursuits of natural\r\nphilosophy and astronomy. In the twenty-fifth year of his age, he was\r\nappointed, by the Grand Duke of Tuscany, professor of mathematics in the\r\nUniversity of Pisa. At that period, there prevailed in all the schools a\r\nmost extraordinary reverence for the writings of Aristotle, the\r\npreceptor of Alexander the Great,--a philosopher who flourished in\r\nGreece, about three hundred years before the Christian era. Aristotle,\r\nby his great genius and learning, gained a wonderful ascendency over the\r\nminds of men, and became the oracle of the whole reading world for\r\ntwenty centuries. It was held, on the one hand, that all truths worth\r\nknowing were contained in the writings of Aristotle; and, on the other,\r\nthat an assertion which contradicted any thing in Aristotle could not be\r\ntrue. But Galileo had a greatness of mind which soared above the\r\nprejudices of the age in which he lived, and dared to interrogate Nature\r\nby the two great and only successful methods of discovering her\r\nsecrets,--experiment and observation. Galileo was indeed the first\r\nphilosopher that ever fully employed experiments as the means of\r\nlearning the laws of Nature, by imitating on a small what she performs\r\non a great scale, and thus detecting her modes of operation. Archimedes,\r\nthe great Sicilian philosopher, had in ancient times introduced\r\nmathematical or geometrical reasoning into natural philosophy; but it\r\nwas reserved for Galileo to unite the advantages of both mathematical\r\nand experimental reasonings in the study of Nature,--both sure and the\r\nonly sure guides to truth, in this department of knowledge, at least.\r\nExperiment and observation furnish materials upon which geometry builds\r\nher reasonings, and from which she derives many truths that either lie\r\nfor ever hidden from the eye of observation, or which it would require\r\nages to unfold.\r\n\r\nThis method, of interrogating Nature by experiment and observation, was\r\nmatured into a system by Lord Bacon, a celebrated English philosopher,\r\nearly in the seventeenth century,--indeed, during the life of Galileo.\r\nPrevious to that time, the inquirers into Nature did not open their eyes\r\nto see how the facts really _are_; but, by metaphysical processes, in\r\nimitation of Aristotle, determined how they _ought to be_, and hastily\r\nconcluded that they were so. Thus, they did not study into the laws of\r\nmotion, by observing how motion actually takes place, under various\r\ncircumstances, but first, in their closets, constructed a definition of\r\nmotion, and thence inferred all its properties. The system of reasoning\r\nrespecting the phenomena of Nature, introduced by Lord Bacon, was this:\r\nin the first place, to examine all the facts of the case, and then from\r\nthese to determine the laws of Nature. To derive general conclusions\r\nfrom the comparison of a great number of individual instances\r\nconstitutes the peculiarity of the Baconian philosophy. It is called the\r\n_inductive_ system, because its conclusions were built on the induction,\r\nor comparison, of a great many single facts. Previous to the time of\r\nLord Bacon, hardly any insight had been gained into the causes of\r\nnatural phenomena, and hardly one of the laws of Nature had been clearly\r\nestablished, because all the inquirers into Nature were upon a wrong\r\nroad, groping their way through the labyrinth of error. Bacon pointed\r\nout to them the true path, and held before them the torch-light of\r\nexperiment and observation, under whose guidance all successful students\r\nof Nature have since walked, and by whose illumination they have gained\r\nso wonderful an insight into the mysteries of the natural world.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that two such characters as Bacon and Galileo\r\nshould appear on the stage at the same time, who, without any\r\ncommunication with each other, or perhaps without any personal knowledge\r\nof each other's existence, should have each developed the true method of\r\ninvestigating the laws of Nature. Galileo practised what Bacon only\r\ntaught; and some, therefore, with much reason, consider Galileo as a\r\ngreater philosopher than Bacon. \"Bacon,\" says Hume, \"pointed out, at a\r\ngreat distance, the road to philosophy; Galileo both pointed it out to\r\nothers, and made, himself, considerable advances in it. The Englishman\r\nwas ignorant of geometry; the Florentine revived that science, excelled\r\nin it, and was the first who applied it, together with experiment, to\r\nnatural philosophy. The former rejected, with the most positive disdain,\r\nthe system of Copernicus; the latter fortified it with new proofs,\r\nderived both from reason and the senses.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect that geometry is a science built upon self-evident\r\ntruths, and that all its conclusions are the result of pure\r\ndemonstration, and can admit of no controversy; when we further reflect,\r\nthat experimental evidence rests on the testimony of the senses, and we\r\ninfer a thing to be true because we actually see it to be so; it shows\r\nus the extreme bigotry, the darkness visible, that beclouded the human\r\nintellect, when it not only refused to admit conclusions first\r\nestablished by pure geometrical reasoning, and afterwards confirmed by\r\nexperiments exhibited in the light of day, but instituted the most cruel\r\npersecutions against the great philosopher who first proclaimed these\r\ntruths. Galileo was hated and persecuted by two distinct bodies of men,\r\nboth possessing great influence in their respective spheres,--the one\r\nconsisting of the learned doctors of philosophy, who did nothing more,\r\nfrom age to age, than reiterate the doctrines of Aristotle, and were\r\nconsequently alarmed at the promulgation of principles subversive of\r\nthose doctrines; the other consisting of the Romish priesthood,\r\ncomprising the terrible Inquisition, who denounced the truths taught by\r\nGalileo, as inconsistent with certain declarations of the Holy\r\nScriptures. We shall see, as we advance, what a fearful warfare he had\r\nto wage against these combined powers of darkness.\r\n\r\nAristotle had asserted, that, if two different weights of the same\r\nmaterial were let fall from the same height, the heavier one would reach\r\nthe ground sooner than the other, in proportion as it was more weighty.\r\nFor example: if a ten-pound leaden weight and a one-pound were let fall\r\nfrom a given height at the same instant, the former would reach the\r\nground ten times as soon as the latter. No one thought of making the\r\ntrial, but it was deemed sufficient that Aristotle had said so; and\r\naccordingly this assertion had long been received as an axiom in the\r\nscience of motion. Galileo ventured to appeal from the authority of\r\nAristotle to that of his own senses, and maintained, that both weights\r\nwould fall in the same time. The learned doctors ridiculed the idea.\r\nGalileo tried the experiment in their presence, by letting fall, at the\r\nsame instant, large and small weights from the top of the celebrated\r\nleaning tower of Pisa. Yet, with the sound of the two weights clicking\r\nupon the pavement at the same moment, they still maintained that the\r\nten-pound weight would reach the ground in one tenth part of the time of\r\nthe other, because they could quote the chapter and verse of Aristotle\r\nwhere the fact was asserted. Wearied and disgusted with the malice and\r\nfolly of these Aristotelian philosophers, Galileo, at the age of\r\ntwenty-eight, resigned his situation in the university of Pisa, and\r\nremoved to Padua, in the university of which place he was elected\r\nprofessor of mathematics. Up to this period, Galileo had devoted himself\r\nchiefly to the studies of the laws of motion, and the other branches of\r\nmechanical philosophy. Soon afterwards, he began to publish his\r\nwritings, in rapid succession, and became at once among the most\r\nconspicuous of his age,--a rank which he afterwards well sustained and\r\ngreatly exalted, by the invention of the telescope, and by his numerous\r\nastronomical discoveries. I will reserve an account of these great\r\nachievements until we come to that part of astronomy to which they were\r\nmore immediately related, and proceed, now, to explain to you the\r\nleading principles of _terrestrial gravity_, as exemplified in falling\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nFirst, _all bodies near the earth's surface fall in straight lines\r\ntowards the centre of the earth_. We are not to infer from this fact,\r\nthat there resides at the centre any peculiar force, as a great\r\nloadstone, for example, which attracts bodies towards itself; but bodies\r\nfall towards the centre of the sphere, because the combined attractions\r\nof all the particles of matter in the earth, each exerting its proper\r\nforce upon the body, would carry it towards the centre. This may be\r\neasily illustrated by a diagram. Let B, Fig. 29, page 140, be the\r\ncentre of the earth, and A a body without it. Every portion of matter in\r\nthe earth exerts some force on A, to draw it down to the earth. But\r\nsince there is just as much matter on one side of the line A B, as on\r\nthe other side, each half exerts an equal force to draw the body towards\r\nitself; therefore it falls in the direction of the diagonal between the\r\ntwo forces. Thus, if we compare the effects of any two particles of\r\nmatter at equal distances from the line A B, but on opposite sides of\r\nit, as _a_, _b_, while the force of the particle at _a_ would tend to\r\ndraw A in the direction of A _a_, that of _b_ would draw it in the\r\ndirection of A _b_, and it would fall in the line A B, half way between\r\nthe two. The same would hold true of any other two corresponding\r\nparticles of matter on different sides of the earth, in respect to a\r\nbody situated in any place without it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\nSecondly, _all bodies fall towards the earth, from the same height, with\r\nequal velocities_. A musket-ball, and the finest particle of down, if\r\nlet fall from a certain height towards the earth, tend to descend\r\ntowards it at the same rate, and would proceed with equal speed, were it\r\nnot for the resistance of the air, which retards the down more than it\r\ndoes the ball, and finally stops it. If, however, the air be removed out\r\nof the way, as it may be by means of the air-pump, the two bodies keep\r\nside by side in falling from the greatest height at which we can try the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThirdly, _bodies, in falling towards the earth, have their rate of\r\nmotion continually accelerated_. Suppose we let fall a musket-ball from\r\nthe top of a high tower, and watch its progress, disregarding the\r\nresistance of the air: the first second, it will pass over sixteen feet\r\nand one inch, but its speed will be constantly increased, being all the\r\nwhile urged onward by the same force, and retaining all that it has\r\nalready acquired; so that the longer it is in falling, the swifter its\r\nmotion becomes. Consequently, when bodies fall from a great height, they\r\nacquire an immense velocity before they reach the earth. Thus, a man\r\nfalling from a balloon, or from the mast-head of a ship, is broken in\r\npieces; and those meteoric stones, which sometimes fall from the sky,\r\nbury themselves deep in the earth. On measuring the spaces through which\r\na body falls, it is found, that it will fall four times as far in two\r\nseconds as in one, and one hundred times as far in ten seconds as in\r\none; and universally, the space described by a falling body is\r\nproportioned to the time multiplied into itself; that is, to the square\r\nof the time.\r\n\r\nFourthly, _gravity is proportioned to the quantity of matter_. A body\r\nwhich has twice as much matter as another exerts a force of attraction\r\ntwice as great, and also receives twice as much from the same body as it\r\nwould do, if it were only just as heavy as that body. Thus the earth,\r\ncontaining, as it does, forty times as much matter as the moon, exerts\r\nupon the moon forty times as much force as it would do, were its mass\r\nthe same with that of the moon; but it is also capable of _receiving_\r\nforty times as much gravity from the moon as it would do, were its mass\r\nthe same as the moon's; so that the power of attracting and that of\r\nbeing attracted are reciprocal; and it is therefore correct to say, that\r\nthe moon attracts the earth _just as much_ as the earth attracts the\r\nmoon; and the same may be said of any two bodies, however different in\r\nquantity of matter.\r\n\r\nFifthly, _gravity, when acting at a distance from the earth, is not as\r\nintense as it is near the earth_. At such a distance as we are\r\naccustomed to ascend above the general level of the earth, no great\r\ndifference is observed. On the tops of high mountains, we find bodies\r\nfalling towards the earth, with nearly the same speed as they do from\r\nthe smallest elevations. It is found, nevertheless, that there is a real\r\ndifference; so that, in fact, the weight of a body (which is nothing\r\nmore than the measure of its force of gravity) is not quite so great on\r\nthe tops of high mountains as at the general level of the sea. Thus, a\r\nthousand pounds' weight, on the top of a mountain half a mile high,\r\nwould weigh a quarter of a pound less than at the level of the sea; and\r\nif elevated four thousand miles above the earth,--that is, _twice_ as\r\nfar from the centre of the earth as the surface is from the centre,--it\r\nwould weigh only one fourth as much as before; if _three times_ as far,\r\nit would weigh only one ninth as much. So that the force of gravity\r\ndecreases, as we recede from the earth, in the same proportion as the\r\nsquare of the distance increases. This fact is generalized by saying,\r\nthat _the force of gravity, at different distances from the earth, is\r\ninversely as the square of the distance_.\r\n\r\nWere a body to fall from a great distance,--suppose a thousand times\r\nthat of the radius of the earth,--the force of gravity being one million\r\ntimes less than that at the surface of the earth, the motion of the body\r\nwould be exceedingly slow, carrying it over only the sixth part of an\r\ninch in a day. It would be a long time, therefore, in making any\r\nsensible approaches towards the earth; but at length, as it drew near to\r\nthe earth it would acquire a very great velocity, and would finally rush\r\ntowards it with prodigious violence. Falling so far, and being\r\ncontinually accelerated on the way, we might suppose that it would at\r\nlength attain a velocity infinitely great; but it can be demonstrated,\r\nthat, if a body were to fall from an infinite distance, attracted to the\r\nearth only by gravity, it could never acquire a velocity greater than\r\nabout seven miles per second. This, however, is a speed inconceivably\r\ngreat, being about eighteen times the greatest velocity that can be\r\ngiven to a cannon-ball, and more than twenty-five thousand miles per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nBut the phenomena of falling bodies must have long been observed, and\r\ntheir laws had been fully investigated by Galileo and others, before the\r\ncause of their falling was understood, or any such principle as\r\ngravity, inherent in the earth and in all bodies, was applied to them.\r\nThe developement of this great principle was the work of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton; and I will give you, in my next Letter, some particulars\r\nrespecting the life and discoveries of this wonderful man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIV.\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON.--UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION.--FIGURE OF THE EARTH'S\r\nORBIT.--PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES.\r\n\r\n    \"The heavens are all his own; from the wild rule\r\n    Of whirling vortices, and circling spheres,\r\n    To their first great simplicity restored.\r\n    The schools astonished stood; but found it vain\r\n    To combat long with demonstration clear,\r\n    And, unawakened, dream beneath the blaze\r\n    Of truth. At once their pleasing visions fled,\r\n    With the light shadows of the morning mixed,\r\n    When Newton rose, our philosophic sun.\"--_Thomson's Elegy._\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON was born in Lincolnshire, England, in 1642, just one\r\nyear after the death of Galileo. His father died before he was born, and\r\nhe was a helpless infant, of a diminutive size, and so feeble a frame,\r\nthat his attendants hardly expected his life for a single hour. The\r\nfamily dwelling was of humble architecture, situated in a retired but\r\nbeautiful valley, and was surrounded by a small farm, which afforded but\r\na scanty living to the widowed mother and her precious charge. The cut\r\non page 144, Fig 30, represents the modest mansion, and the emblems of\r\nrustic life that first met the eyes of this pride of the British nation,\r\nand ornament of human nature. It will probably be found, that genius has\r\noftener emanated from the cottage than from the palace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\nThe boyhood of Newton was distinguished chiefly for his ingenious\r\nmechanical contrivances. Among other pieces of mechanism, he constructed\r\na windmill so curious and complete in its workmanship, as to excite\r\nuniversal admiration. After carrying it a while by the force of the\r\nwind, he resolved to substitute animal power, and for this purpose he\r\ninclosed in it a mouse, which he called the miller, and which kept the\r\nmill a-going by acting on a tread-wheel. The power of the mouse was\r\nbrought into action by unavailing attempts to reach a portion of corn\r\nplaced above the wheel. A water-clock, a four-wheeled carriage propelled\r\nby the rider himself, and kites of superior workmanship, were among the\r\nproductions of the mechanical genius of this gifted boy. At a little\r\nlater period, he began to turn his attention to the motions of the\r\nheavenly bodies, and constructed several sun-dials on the walls of the\r\nhouse where he lived. All this was before he had reached his fifteenth\r\nyear. At this age, he was sent by his mother, in company with an old\r\nfamily servant, to a neighboring market-town, to dispose of products of\r\ntheir farm, and to buy articles of merchandise for their family use; but\r\nthe young philosopher left all these negotiations to his worthy partner,\r\noccupying himself, mean-while, with a collection of old books, which he\r\nhad found in a garret. At other times, he stopped on the road, and took\r\nshelter with his book under a hedge, until the servant returned. They\r\nendeavored to educate him as a farmer; but the perusal of a book, the\r\nconstruction of a water-mill, or some other mechanical or scientific\r\namusement, absorbed all his thoughts, when the sheep were going astray,\r\nand the cattle were devouring or treading down the corn. One of his\r\nuncles having found him one day under a hedge, with a book in his hand,\r\nand entirely absorbed in meditation, took it from him, and found that it\r\nwas a mathematical problem which so engrossed his attention. His\r\nfriends, therefore, wisely resolved to favor the bent of his genius, and\r\nremoved him from the farm to the school, to prepare for the university.\r\nIn the eighteenth year of his age, Newton was admitted into Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge. He made rapid and extraordinary advances in the\r\nmathematics, and soon afforded unequivocal presages of that greatness\r\nwhich afterwards placed him at the head of the human intellect. In 1669,\r\nat the age of twenty-seven, he became professor of mathematics at\r\nCambridge, a post which he occupied for many years afterwards. During\r\nthe four or five years previous to this he had, in fact, made most of\r\nthose great discoveries which have immortalized his name. We are at\r\npresent chiefly interested in one of these, namely, that of _universal\r\ngravitation_; and let us see by what steps he was conducted to this\r\ngreatest of scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1666, when Newton was about twenty-four years of age, the\r\nplague was prevailing at Cambridge, and he retired into the country. One\r\nday, while he sat in a garden, musing on the phenomena of Nature around\r\nhim, an apple chanced to fall to the ground. Reflecting on the\r\nmysterious power that makes all bodies near the earth fall towards its\r\ncentre, and considering that this power remains unimpaired at\r\nconsiderable heights above the earth, as on the tops of trees and\r\nmountains, he asked himself,--\"May not the same force extend its\r\ninfluence to a great distance from the earth, even as far as the moon?\r\nIndeed, may not this be the very reason, why the moon is drawn away\r\ncontinually from the straight line in which every body tends to move,\r\nand is thus made to circulate around the earth?\" You will recollect that\r\nit was mentioned, in my Letter which contained an account of the first\r\nlaw of motion, that if a body is put in motion by any force, it will\r\nalways move forward in a straight line, unless some other force compels\r\nit to turn aside from such a direction; and that, when we see a body\r\nmoving in a curve, as a circular orbit, we are authorized to conclude\r\nthat there is some force existing within the circle, which continually\r\ndraws the body away from the direction in which it tends to move.\r\nAccordingly, it was a very natural suggestion, to one so well acquainted\r\nwith the laws of motion as Newton, that the moon should constantly bend\r\ntowards the earth, from a tendency to fall towards it, as any other\r\nheavy body would do, if carried to such a distance from the earth.\r\nNewton had already proved, that if such a power as gravity extends from\r\nthe earth to distant bodies, it must decrease, as the square of the\r\ndistance from the centre of the earth increases; that is, at double the\r\ndistance, it would be four times less; at ten times the distance, one\r\nhundred times less; and so on. Now, it was known that the moon is about\r\nsixty times as far from the centre of the earth as the surface of the\r\nearth is from the centre, and consequently, the force of attraction at\r\nthe moon must be the square of sixty, or thirty-six hundred times less\r\nthan it is at the earth; so that a body at the distance of the moon\r\nwould fall towards the earth very slowly, only one thirty-six hundredth\r\npart as far in a given time, as at the earth. Does the moon actually\r\nfall towards the earth at this rate; or, what is the same thing, does\r\nshe depart at this rate continually from the straight line in which she\r\ntends to move, and in which she would move, if no external force\r\ndiverted her from it? On making the calculation, such was found to be\r\nthe fact. Hence gravity, and no other force than gravity, acts upon the\r\nmoon, and compels her to revolve around the earth. By reasonings equally\r\nconclusive, it was afterwards proved, that a similar force compels all\r\nthe planets to circulate around the sun; and now, we may ascend from the\r\ncontemplation of this force, as we have seen it exemplified in falling\r\nbodies, to that of a universal power whose influence extends to all the\r\nmaterial creation. It is in this sense that we recognise the principle\r\nof universal gravitation, the law of which may be thus enunciated; _all\r\nbodies in the universe, whether great or small, attract each other, with\r\nforces proportioned to their respective quantities of matter, and\r\ninversely as the squares of their distances from each other_.\r\n\r\nThis law asserts, first, that attraction reigns throughout the material\r\nworld, affecting alike the smallest particle of matter and the greatest\r\nbody; secondly, that it acts upon every mass of matter, precisely in\r\nproportion to its quantity; and, thirdly, that its intensity is\r\ndiminished as the square of the distance is increased.\r\n\r\nObservation has fully confirmed the prevalence of this law throughout\r\nthe solar system; and recent discoveries among the fixed stars, to be\r\nmore fully detailed hereafter, indicate that the same law prevails\r\nthere. The law of universal gravitation is therefore held to be the\r\ngrand principle which governs all the celestial motions. Not only is it\r\nconsistent with all the observed motions of the heavenly bodies, even\r\nthe most irregular of those motions, but, when followed out into all its\r\nconsequences, it would be competent to assert that such irregularities\r\nmust take place, even if they had never been observed.\r\n\r\nNewton first published the doctrine of universal gravitation in the\r\n'Principia,' in 1687. The name implies that the work contains the\r\nfundamental principles of natural philosophy and astronomy. Being\r\nfounded upon the immutable basis of mathematics, its conclusions must of\r\ncourse be true and unalterable, and thenceforth we may regard the great\r\nlaws of the universe as traced to their remotest principle. The greatest\r\nastronomers and mathematicians have since occupied themselves in\r\nfollowing out the plan which Newton began, by applying the principles of\r\nuniversal gravitation to all the subordinate as well as to the grand\r\nmovements of the spheres. This great labor has been especially achieved\r\nby La Place, a French mathematician of the highest eminence, in his\r\nprofound work, the 'Mecanique Celeste.' Of this work, our distinguished\r\ncountryman, Dr. Bowditch, has given a magnificent translation, and\r\naccompanied it with a commentary, which both illustrates the original,\r\nand adds a great amount of matter hardly less profound than that.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\nWe have thus far taken the earth's orbit around the sun as a great\r\ncircle, such being its projection on the sphere constituting the\r\ncelestial ecliptic. The real path of the earth around the sun is\r\nlearned, as I before explained to you, by the apparent path of the sun\r\naround the earth once a year. Now, when a body revolves about the earth\r\nat a great distance from us, as is the case with the sun and moon, we\r\ncannot certainly infer that it moves in a circle because it appears to\r\ndescribe a circle on the face of the sky, for such might be the\r\nappearance of its orbit, were it ever so irregular a curve. Thus, if E,\r\nFig. 31, represents the earth, and ACB, the irregular path of a body\r\nrevolving about it, since we should refer the body continually to some\r\nplace on the celestial sphere, XYZ, determined by lines drawn from the\r\neye to the concave sphere through the body, the body, while moving from\r\nA to B through C, would appear to move from X to Z, through Y. Hence, we\r\nmust determine from other circumstances than the actual appearance, what\r\nis the true figure of the orbit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\nWere the earth's path a circle, having the sun in the centre, the sun\r\nwould always appear to be at the same distance from us; that is, the\r\nradius of the orbit, or _radius vector_, (the name given to a line drawn\r\nfrom the centre of the sun to the orbit of any planet,) would always be\r\nof the same length. But the earth's distance from the sun is constantly\r\nvarying, which shows that its orbit is not a circle. We learn the true\r\nfigure of the orbit, by ascertaining the _relative distances_ of the\r\nearth from the sun, at various periods of the year. These distances all\r\nbeing laid down in a diagram, according to their respective lengths, the\r\nextremities, on being connected, give us our first idea of the shape of\r\nthe orbit, which appears of an oval form, and at least resembles an\r\nellipse; and, on further trial, we find that it has the properties of an\r\nellipse. Thus, let E, Fig. 32, be the place of the earth, and _a_, _b_,\r\n_c_, &c., successive positions of the sun; the _relative_ lengths of the\r\nlines E _a_, E _b_, &c., being known, on connecting the points _a_,\r\n_b_, _c_, &c., the resulting figure indicates the true figure of the\r\nearth's orbit.\r\n\r\nThese relative distances are found in two different ways; first, _by\r\nchanges in the sun's apparent diameter_, and, secondly, _by variations\r\nin his angular velocity_. The same object appears to us smaller in\r\nproportion as it is more distant; and if we see a heavenly body varying\r\nin size, at different times, we infer that it is at different distances\r\nfrom us; that when largest, it is nearest to us, and when smallest,\r\nfurthest off. Now, when the sun's diameter is accurately measured by\r\ninstruments, it is found to vary from day to day; being, when greatest,\r\nmore than thirty-two minutes and a half, and when smallest, only\r\nthirty-one minutes and a half,--differing, in all, about seventy-five\r\nseconds. When the diameter is greatest, which happens in January, we\r\nknow that the sun is nearest to us; and when the diameter is least,\r\nwhich occurs in July, we infer that the sun is at the greatest distance\r\nfrom us. The point where the earth, or any planet, in its revolution, is\r\nnearest the sun, is called its _perihelion_; the point where it is\r\nfurthest from the sun, its _aphelion_. Suppose, then, that, about the\r\nfirst of January, when the diameter of the sun is greatest, we draw a\r\nline, E _a_, Fig. 32, to represent it, and afterwards, every ten days,\r\ndraw other lines, E _b_, E _c_, &c.; increasing in the same ratio as the\r\napparent diameters of the sun decrease. These lines must be drawn at\r\nsuch a distance from each other, that the triangles, E _a b_, E _b c_,\r\n&c., shall be all equal to each other, for a reason that will be\r\nexplained hereafter. On connecting the extremities of these lines, we\r\nshall obtain the figure of the earth's orbit.\r\n\r\nSimilar conclusions may be drawn from observations on the sun's _angular\r\nvelocity_. A body appears to move most rapidly when nearest to us.\r\nIndeed, the apparent velocity increases rapidly, as it approaches us,\r\nand as rapidly diminishes, when it recedes from us. If it comes twice as\r\nnear as before, it appears to move not merely twice as swiftly, but four\r\ntimes as swiftly; if it comes ten times nearer, its apparent velocity\r\nis one hundred times as great as before. We say, therefore, that the\r\nvelocity varies inversely as the square of the distance; for, as the\r\ndistance is diminished ten times, the velocity is increased the square\r\nof ten; that is, one hundred times. Now, by noting the time it takes the\r\nsun, from day to day, to cross the central wire of the\r\ntransit-instrument, we learn the comparative velocities with which it\r\nmoves at different times; and from these we derive the comparative\r\ndistances of the sun at the corresponding times; and laying down these\r\nrelative distances in a diagram, as before, we get our first notions of\r\nthe actual figure of the earth's orbit, or the path which it describes\r\nin its annual revolution around the sun.\r\n\r\nHaving now learned the fact, that the earth moves around the sun, not in\r\na circular but in an elliptical orbit, you will desire to know by what\r\nforces it is impelled, to make it describe this figure, with such\r\nuniformity and constancy, from age to age. It is commonly said, that\r\ngravity causes the earth and the planets to circulate around the sun;\r\nand it is true that it is gravity which turns them aside from the\r\nstraight line in which, by the first law of motion, they tend to move,\r\nand thus causes them to revolve around the sun. But what force is that\r\nwhich gave to them this original impulse, and impressed upon them such a\r\ntendency to move forward in a straight line? The name _projectile_ force\r\nis given to it, because it is the same _as though_ the earth were\r\noriginally projected into space, when first created; and therefore its\r\nmotion is the result of two forces, the projectile force, which would\r\ncause it to move forward in a straight line which is a tangent to its\r\norbit, and gravitation, which bends it towards the sun. But before you\r\ncan clearly understand the nature of this motion, and the action of the\r\ntwo forces that produce it, I must explain to you a few elementary\r\nprinciples upon which this and all the other planetary motions depend.\r\n\r\nYou have already learned, that when a body is acted on by two forces, in\r\ndifferent directions, it moves in the direction of neither, but in some\r\ndirection between them. If I throw a stone horizontally, the attraction\r\nof the earth will continually draw it downward, out of the line of\r\ndirection in which it was thrown, and make it descend to the earth in a\r\ncurve. The particular form of the curve will depend on the velocity with\r\nwhich it is thrown. It will always _begin_ to move in the line of\r\ndirection in which it is projected; but it will soon be turned from that\r\nline towards the earth. It will, however, continue nearer to the line of\r\nprojection in proportion as the velocity of projection is greater. Thus,\r\nlet A C, Fig. 33, be perpendicular to the horizon, and A B parallel to\r\nit, and let a stone be thrown from A, in the direction of A B. It will,\r\nin every case, commence its motion in the line A B, which will therefore\r\nbe a tangent to the curve it describes; but, if it is thrown with a\r\nsmall velocity, it will soon depart from the tangent, describing the\r\nline A D; with a greater velocity, it will describe a curve nearer the\r\ntangent, as A E; and with a still greater velocity, it will describe the\r\ncurve A F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\nAs an example of a body revolving in an orbit under the influence of two\r\nforces, suppose a body placed at any point, P, Fig. 34, above the\r\nsurface of the earth, and let P A be the direction of the earth's\r\ncentre; that is, a line perpendicular to the horizon. If the body were\r\nallowed to move, without receiving any impulse, it would descend to the\r\nearth in the direction P A with an accelerated motion. But suppose that,\r\nat the moment of its departure from P, it receives a blow in the\r\ndirection P B, which would carry it to B in the time the body would fall\r\nfrom P to A; then, under the influence of both forces, it would descend\r\nalong the curve P D. If a stronger blow were given to it in the\r\ndirection P B, it would describe a larger curve, P E; or, finally, if\r\nthe impulse were sufficiently strong, it would circulate quite around\r\nthe earth, and return again to P, describing the circle P F G. With a\r\nvelocity of projection still greater, it would describe an ellipse, P I\r\nK; and if the velocity be increased to a certain degree, the figure\r\nbecomes a parabola, L P M,--a curve which never returns into itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 35, page 154, suppose the planet to have passed the point C, at\r\nthe aphelion, with so small a velocity, that the attraction of the sun\r\nbends its path very much, and causes it immediately to begin to approach\r\ntowards the sun. The sun's attraction will increase its velocity, as it\r\nmoves through D, E, and F, for the sun's attractive force on the planet,\r\nwhen at D, is acting in the direction D S; and, on account of the small\r\nangle made between D E and D S, the force acting in the line D S helps\r\nthe planet forward in the path D E, and thus increases its velocity. In\r\nlike manner, the velocity of the planet will be continually increasing\r\nas it passes through D, E, and F; and though the attractive force, on\r\naccount of the planet's nearness, is so much increased, and tends,\r\ntherefore, to make the orbit more curved, yet the velocity is also so\r\nmuch increased, that the orbit is not more curved than before; for the\r\nsame increase of velocity, occasioned by the planet's approach to the\r\nsun, produces a greater increase of centrifugal force, which carries it\r\noff again. We may see, also, the reason why, when the planet has reached\r\nthe most distant parts of its orbit, it does not entirely fly off, and\r\nnever return to the sun; for, when the planet passes along H, K, A, the\r\nsun's attraction retards the planet, just as gravity retards a ball\r\nrolled up hill; and when it has reached C, its velocity is very small,\r\nand the attraction to the centre of force causes a great deflection from\r\nthe tangent, sufficient to give its orbit a great curvature, and the\r\nplanet wheels about, returns to the sun, and goes over the same orbit\r\nagain. As the planet recedes from the sun, its centrifugal force\r\ndiminishes faster than the force of gravity, so that the latter finally\r\npreponderates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\nI shall conclude what I have to say at present, respecting the motion of\r\nthe earth around the sun, by adding a few words respecting the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes.\r\n\r\nThe _precession of the equinoxes_ is a slow but continual shifting of\r\nthe equinoctial points, from east to west. Suppose that we mark the\r\nexact place in the heavens where, during the present year, the sun\r\ncrosses the equator, and that this point is close to a certain star;\r\nnext year, the sun will cross the equator a little way westward of that\r\nstar, and so every year, a little further westward, until, in a long\r\ncourse of ages, the place of the equinox will occupy successively every\r\npart of the ecliptic, until we come round to the same star again. As,\r\ntherefore, the sun revolving from west to east, in his apparent orbit,\r\ncomes round to the point where it left the equinox, it meets the equinox\r\nbefore it reaches that point. The appearance is as though the equinox\r\n_goes forward_ to meet the sun, and hence the phenomenon is called the\r\n_precession_ of the equinoxes; and the fact is expressed by saying, that\r\nthe equinoxes retrograde on the ecliptic, until the line of the\r\nequinoxes (a straight line drawn from one equinox to the other) makes a\r\ncomplete revolution, from east to west. This is of course a retrograde\r\nmotion, since it is contrary to the order of the signs. The equator is\r\nconceived as _sliding_ westward on the ecliptic, always preserving the\r\nsame inclination to it, as a ring, placed at a small angle with another\r\nof nearly the same size which remains fixed, may be slid quite around\r\nit, giving a corresponding motion to the two points of intersection. It\r\nmust be observed, however, that this mode of conceiving of the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes is purely imaginary, and is employed merely\r\nfor the convenience of representation.\r\n\r\nThe amount of precession annually is fifty seconds and one tenth;\r\nwhence, since there are thirty-six hundred seconds in a degree, and\r\nthree hundred and sixty degrees in the whole circumference of the\r\necliptic, and consequently one million two hundred and ninety-six\r\nthousand seconds, this sum, divided by fifty seconds and one tenth,\r\ngives twenty-five thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight years for the\r\nperiod of a complete revolution of the equinoxes.\r\n\r\nSuppose we now fix to the centre of each of the two rings, before\r\nmentioned, a wire representing its axis, one corresponding to the axis\r\nof the ecliptic, the other to that of the equator, the extremity of each\r\nbeing the pole of its circle. As the ring denoting the equator turns\r\nround on the ecliptic, which, with its axis, remains fixed, it is easy\r\nto conceive that the axis of the equator revolves around that of the\r\necliptic, and the pole of the equator around the pole of the ecliptic,\r\nand constantly at a distance equal to the inclination of the two\r\ncircles. To transfer our conceptions to the celestial sphere, we may\r\neasily see that the axis of the diurnal sphere (that of the earth\r\nproduced) would not have its pole constantly in the same place among the\r\nstars, but that this pole would perform a slow revolution around the\r\npole of the ecliptic, from east to west, completing the circuit in about\r\ntwenty-six thousand years. Hence the star which we now call the\r\npole-star has not always enjoyed that distinction, nor will it always\r\nenjoy it, hereafter. When the earliest catalogues of the stars were\r\nmade, this star was twelve degrees from the pole. It is now one degree\r\ntwenty-four minutes, and will approach still nearer; or, to speak more\r\naccurately, the pole will come still nearer to this star, after which it\r\nwill leave it, and successively pass by others. In about thirteen\r\nthousand years, the bright star Lyra (which lies near the circle in\r\nwhich the pole of the equator revolves about the pole of the ecliptic,\r\non the side opposite to the present pole-star) will be within five\r\ndegrees of the pole, and will constitute the pole-star. As Lyra now\r\npasses near our zenith, you might suppose that the change of position of\r\nthe pole among the stars would be attended with a change of altitude of\r\nthe north pole above the horizon. This mistaken idea is one of the many\r\nmisapprehensions which result from the habit of considering the horizon\r\nas a fixed circle in space. However the pole might shift its position in\r\nspace, we should still be at the same distance from it, and our horizon\r\nwould always reach the same distance beyond it.\r\n\r\nThe time occupied by the sun, in passing from the equinoctial point\r\nround to the same point again, is called the _tropical year_. As the sun\r\ndoes not perform a complete revolution in this interval, but falls short\r\nof it fifty seconds and one tenth, the tropical year is shorter than the\r\nsidereal by twenty minutes and twenty seconds, in mean solar time, this\r\nbeing the time of describing an arc of fifty seconds and one tenth, in\r\nthe annual revolution.\r\n\r\nThe changes produced by the precession of the equinoxes, in the apparent\r\nplaces of the circumpolar stars, have led to some interesting results in\r\n_chronology_. In consequence of the retrograde motion of the equinoctial\r\npoints, the _signs_ of the ecliptic do not correspond, at present, to\r\nthe _constellations_ which bear the same names, but lie about one sign,\r\nor thirty degrees, westward of them. Thus, that division of the ecliptic\r\nwhich is called the sign Taurus lies in the constellation Aries, and the\r\nsign Gemini, in the constellation Taurus. Undoubtedly, however, when the\r\necliptic was thus first divided, and the divisions named, the several\r\nconstellations lay in the respective divisions which bear their names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE MOON.\r\n\r\n    \"Soon as the evening shades prevail\r\n    The Moon takes up the wondrous tale,\r\n    And nightly to the listening earth\r\n    Repeats the story of her birth.\"--_Addison._\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING now learned so much of astronomy as relates to the earth and the\r\nsun, and the mutual relations which exist between them, you are prepared\r\nto enter with advantage upon the survey of the other bodies that compose\r\nthe solar system. This being done, we shall then have still before us\r\nthe boundless range of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nThe moon, which next claims our notice, has been studied by astronomers\r\nwith greater attention than any other of the heavenly bodies, since her\r\ncomparative nearness to the earth brings her peculiarly within the range\r\nof our telescopes, and her periodical changes and very irregular\r\nmotions, afford curious subjects, both for observation and speculation.\r\nThe mild light of the moon also invites our gaze, while her varying\r\naspects serve barbarous tribes, especially, for a kind of dial-plate\r\ninscribed on the face of the sky, for weeks, and months, and times, and\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nThe moon is distant from the earth about two hundred and forty thousand\r\nmiles; or, more exactly, two hundred and thirty-eight thousand five\r\nhundred and forty-five miles. Her angular or apparent diameter is about\r\nhalf a degree, and her real diameter, two thousand one hundred and sixty\r\nmiles. She is a companion, or satellite, to the earth, revolving around\r\nit every month, and accompanying us in our annual revolution around the\r\nsun. Although her nearness to us makes her appear as a large and\r\nconspicuous object in the heavens, yet, in comparison with most of the\r\nother celestial bodies, she is in fact very small, being only one\r\nforty-ninth part as large as the earth, and only about one seventy\r\nmillionth part as large as the sun.\r\n\r\nThe moon shines by light borrowed from the sun, being itself an opaque\r\nbody, like the earth. When the disk, or any portion of it, is\r\nilluminated, we can plainly discern, even with the naked eye, varieties\r\nof light and shade, indicating inequalities of surface which we imagine\r\nto be land and water. I believe it is the common impression, that the\r\ndarker portions are land and the lighter portions water; but if either\r\npart is water, it must be the darker regions. A smooth polished surface,\r\nlike water, would reflect the sun's light like a mirror. It would, like\r\na convex mirror, form a diminished image of the sun, but would not\r\nitself appear luminous like an uneven surface, which multiplies the\r\nlight by numerous reflections within itself. Thus, from this cause, high\r\nbroken mountainous districts appear more luminous than extensive plains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Figures 36, 37. TELESCOPIC VIEWS OF THE MOON.]\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the telescope, we may see undoubted indications of\r\nmountains and valleys. Indeed, with a good glass, we can discover the\r\nmost decisive evidence that the surface of the moon is exceedingly\r\nvaried,--one part ascending in lofty peaks, another clustering in\r\nhuge mountain groups, or long ranges, and another bearing all the marks\r\nof deep caverns or valleys. You will not, indeed, at the first sight of\r\nthe moon through a telescope, recognise all these different objects. If\r\nyou look at the moon when half her disk is enlightened, (which is the\r\nbest time for seeing her varieties of surface,) you will, at the first\r\nglance, observe a motley appearance, particularly along the line called\r\nthe _terminator_, which separates the enlightened from the unenlightened\r\npart of the disk. (Fig. 37.) On one side of the terminator, within the\r\ndark part of the disk, you will see illuminated points, and short,\r\ncrooked lines, like rude characters marked with chalk on a black ground.\r\nOn the other side of the terminator you will see a succession of little\r\ncircular groups, appearing like numerous bubbles of oil on the surface\r\nof water. The further you carry your eye from the terminator, on the\r\nsame side of it, the more indistinctly formed these bubbles appear,\r\nuntil towards the edge of the moon they assume quite a different aspect.\r\n\r\nSome persons, when they look into a telescope for the first time, having\r\nheard that mountains and valleys are to be seen, and discovering nothing\r\nbut these unmeaning figures, break off in disappointment, and have their\r\nfaith in these things rather diminished than increased. I would advise\r\nyou, therefore, before you take even your first view of the moon through\r\na telescope, to form as clear an idea as you can, how mountains, and\r\nvalleys, and caverns, situated at such a distance from the eye, ought to\r\nlook, and by what marks they may be recognised. Seize, if possible, the\r\nmost favorable period, (about the time of the first quarter,) and\r\npreviously learn from drawings and explanations, how to interpret every\r\nthing you see.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, ought to be the respective appearances of mountains,\r\nvalleys, and deep craters, or caverns, in the moon? The sun shines on\r\nthe moon in the same way as it shines on the earth; and let, us reflect,\r\nthen, upon the manner in which it strikes similar objects here. One\r\nhalf the globe is constantly enlightened; and, by the revolution of the\r\nearth on its axis, the terminator, or the line which separates the\r\nenlightened from the unenlightened part of the earth, travels along from\r\neast to west, over different places, as we see the moon's terminator\r\ntravel over her disk from new to full moon; although, in the case of the\r\nearth, the motion is more rapid, and depends on a different cause. In\r\nthe morning, the sun's light first strikes upon the tops of the\r\nmountains, and, if they are very high, they may be brightly illuminated\r\nwhile it is yet night in the valleys below. By degrees, as the sun\r\nrises, the circle of illumination travels down the mountain, until at\r\nlength it reaches the bottom of the valleys; and these in turn enjoy the\r\nfull light of day. Again, a mountain casts a shadow opposite to the sun,\r\nwhich is very long when the sun first rises, and shortens continually as\r\nthe sun ascends, its length at a given time, however, being proportioned\r\nto the height of the mountain; so that, if the shadow be still very long\r\nwhen the sun is far above the horizon, we infer that the mountain is\r\nvery lofty. We may, moreover, form some judgment of the shape of a\r\nmountain, by observing that of its shadow.\r\n\r\nNow, the moon is so distant that we could not easily distinguish places\r\nsimply by their elevations, since they would be projected into the same\r\nimaginary plane which constitutes the apparent disk of the moon; but the\r\nforegoing considerations would enable us to infer their existence. Thus,\r\nwhen you view the moon at any time within her first quarter, but better\r\nnear the end of that period, you will observe, on the side of the\r\nterminator within the dark part of the disk, the tops of mountains which\r\nthe light of the sun is just striking, as the morning sun strikes the\r\ntops of mountains on the earth. These you will recognise by those white\r\nspecks and little crooked lines, before mentioned, as is represented in\r\nFig. 37. These bright points and lines you will see altering their\r\nfigure, every hour, as they come more and more into the sun's light;\r\nand, mean-while, other bright points, very minute at first, will start\r\ninto view, which also in turn grow larger as the terminator approaches\r\nthem, until they fall into the enlightened part of the disk. As they\r\nfall further and further within this part, you will have additional\r\nproofs that they are mountains, from the shadows which they cast on the\r\nplain, always in a direction opposite to the sun. The mountain itself\r\nmay entirely disappear, or become confounded with the other enlightened\r\nportions of the surface; but its position and its shape may still be\r\nrecognised by the dark line which it projects on the plane. This line\r\nwill correspond in shape to that of the mountain, presenting at one time\r\na long serpentine stripe of black, denoting that the mountain is a\r\ncontinued range; at another time exhibiting a conical figure tapering to\r\na point, or a series of such sharp points; or a serrated, uneven\r\ntermination, indicating, in each case respectively, a conical mountain,\r\nor a group of peaks, or a range with lofty cliffs. All these appearances\r\nwill indeed be seen in miniature; but a little familiarity with them\r\nwill enable you to give them, in imagination, their proper dimensions,\r\nas you give to the pictures of known animals their due sizes, although\r\ndrawn on a scale far below that of real life.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, let us see how valleys and deep craters in the moon\r\nmight be expected to appear. We could not expect to see depressions any\r\nmore than elevations, since both would alike be projected on the same\r\nimaginary disk. But we may recognise such depressions, from the manner\r\nin which the light of the sun shines into them. When we hold a china\r\ntea-cup at some distance from a candle, in the night, the candle being\r\nelevated but little above the level of the top of the cup, a luminous\r\ncrescent will be formed on the side of the cup opposite to the candle,\r\nwhile the side next to the candle will be covered by a deep shadow. As\r\nwe gradually elevate the candle, the crescent enlarges and travels down\r\nthe side of the cup, until finally the whole interior becomes\r\nilluminated. We observe similar appearances in the moon, which we\r\nrecognise as deep depressions. They are those circular spots near the\r\nterminator before spoken of, which look like bubbles of oil floating on\r\nwater. They are nothing else than circular craters or deep valleys. When\r\nthey are so situated that the light of the sun is just beginning to\r\nshine into them, you may see, as in the tea-cup, a luminous crescent\r\naround the side furthest from the sun, while a deep black shadow is cast\r\non the side next to the sun. As the cavity is turned more and more\r\ntowards the light, the crescent enlarges, until at length the whole\r\ninterior is illuminated. If the tea-cup be placed on a table, and a\r\ncandle be held at some distance from it, nearly on a level with the top,\r\nbut a little above it, the cup itself will cast a shadow on the table,\r\nlike any other elevated object. In like manner, many of these circular\r\nspots on the moon cast deep shadows behind them, indicating that the\r\ntops of the craters are elevated far above the general level of the\r\nmoon. The regularity of some of these circular spots is very remarkable.\r\nThe circle, in some instances, appears as well formed as could be\r\ndescribed by a pair of compasses, while in the centre there not\r\nunfrequently is seen a conical mountain casting its pointed shadow on\r\nthe bottom of the crater. I hope you will enjoy repeated opportunities\r\nto view the moon through a telescope. Allow me to recommend to you, not\r\nto rest satisfied with a hasty or even with a single view, but to verify\r\nthe preceding remarks by repeated and careful inspection of the lunar\r\ndisk, at different ages of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe various places on the moon's disk have received appropriate names.\r\nThe dusky regions being formerly supposed to be seas, were named\r\naccordingly; and other remarkable places have each two names, one\r\nderived from some well-known spot on the earth, and the other from some\r\ndistinguished personage. Thus, the same bright spot on the surface of\r\nthe moon is called _Mount Sinai_ or _Tycho_, and another, _Mount Etna_\r\nor _Copernicus_. The names of individuals, however, are more used than\r\nthe others. The diagram, Fig. 36, (see page 159,) represents rudely, the\r\ntelescopic appearance of the full moon. The reality is far more\r\nbeautiful. A few of the most remarkable points have the following names\r\ncorresponding to the numbers and letters on the map.\r\n\r\n    1. Tycho,                6. Eratosthenes,\r\n    2. Kepler,               7. Plato,\r\n    3. Copernicus,           8. Archimedes,\r\n    4. Aristarchus,          9. Eudoxus,\r\n    5. Helicon,              10. Aristotle.\r\n\r\n    A. Mare Humorum,  _Sea of Humors_,\r\n    B. Mare Nubium,   _Sea of Clouds_,\r\n    C. Mare Imbrium,  _Sea of Rains_,\r\n    D. Mare Nectaris, _Sea of Nectar_,\r\n    E. Mare Tranquillitatis, _Sea of Tranquillity_,\r\n    F. Mare Serenitatis,  _Sea of Serenity_,\r\n    G. Mare Fecunditatis, _Sea of Plenty_,\r\n    H. Mare Crisium,  _Crisian Sea_.\r\n\r\nThe heights of the lunar mountains, and the depths of the valleys, can\r\nbe estimated with a considerable degree of accuracy. Some of the\r\nmountains are as high as five miles, and the valleys, in some instances,\r\nare four miles deep. Hence it is inferred, that the surface of the moon\r\nis more broken and irregular than that of the earth, its mountains being\r\nhigher and its valleys deeper, in proportion to its magnitude, than\r\nthose of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of surface in the moon, as seen by the aid of large\r\ntelescopes, have been well described by Dr. Dick, in his 'Celestial\r\nScenery,' and I cannot give you a better idea of them, than to add a few\r\nextracts from his work. The lunar mountains in general exhibit an\r\narrangement and an aspect very different from the mountain scenery of\r\nour globe. They may be arranged under the four following varieties:\r\n\r\nFirst, _insulated mountains_, which rise from plains nearly level,\r\nshaped like a sugar loaf, which may be supposed to present an appearance\r\nsomewhat similar to Mount Etna, or the Peak of Teneriffe. The shadows\r\nof these mountains, in certain phases of the moon, are as distinctly\r\nperceived as the shadow of an upright staff, when placed opposite to the\r\nsun; and these heights can be calculated from the length of their\r\nshadows. Some of these mountains being elevated in the midst of\r\nextensive plains, would present to a spectator on their summits\r\nmagnificent views of the surrounding regions.\r\n\r\nSecondly, _mountain ranges_, extending in length two or three hundred\r\nmiles. These ranges bear a distant resemblance to our Alps, Apennines,\r\nand Andes; but they are much less in extent. Some of them appear very\r\nrugged and precipitous; and the highest ranges are in some places more\r\nthan four miles in perpendicular altitude. In some instances, they are\r\nnearly in a straight line from northeast to southwest, as in the range\r\ncalled the _Apennines_; in other cases, they assume the form of a\r\nsemicircle, or crescent.\r\n\r\nThirdly, _circular ranges_, which appear on almost every part of the\r\nmoon's surface, particularly in its southern regions. This is one grand\r\npeculiarity of the lunar ranges, to which we have nothing similar on the\r\nearth. A plain, and sometimes a large cavity, is surrounded with a\r\ncircular ridge of mountains, which encompasses it like a mighty rampart.\r\nThese annular ridges and plains are of all dimensions, from a mile to\r\nforty or fifty miles in diameter, and are to be seen in great numbers\r\nover every region of the moon's surface; they are most conspicuous,\r\nhowever, near the upper and lower limbs, about the time of the half\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nThe mountains which form these circular ridges are of different\r\nelevations, from one fifth of a mile to three miles and a half, and\r\ntheir shadows cover one half of the plain at the base. These plains are\r\nsometimes on a level with the general surface of the moon, and in other\r\ncases they are sunk a mile or more below the level of the ground which\r\nsurrounds the exterior circle of the mountains.\r\n\r\nFourthly, _central mountains_, or those which are placed in the middle\r\nof circular plains. In many of the plains and cavities surrounded by\r\ncircular ranges of mountains there stands a single insulated mountain,\r\nwhich rises from the centre of the plain, and whose shadow sometimes\r\nextends, in the form of a pyramid, half across the plain to the opposite\r\nridges. These central mountains are generally from half a mile to a mile\r\nand a half in perpendicular altitude. In some instances, they have two,\r\nand sometimes three, different tops, whose shadows can be easily\r\ndistinguished from each other. Sometimes they are situated towards one\r\nside of the plain, or cavity; but in the great majority of instances\r\ntheir position is nearly or exactly central. The lengths of their bases\r\nvary from five to about fifteen or sixteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe _lunar caverns_ form a very peculiar and prominent feature of the\r\nmoon's surface, and are to be seen throughout almost every region, but\r\nare most numerous in the southwest part of the moon. Nearly a hundred of\r\nthem, great and small, may be distinguished in that quarter. They are\r\nall nearly of a circular shape, and appear like a very shallow egg-cup.\r\nThe smaller cavities appear, within, almost like a hollow cone, with the\r\nsides tapering towards the centre; but the larger ones have, for the\r\nmost part, flat bottoms, from the centre of which there frequently rises\r\na small, steep, conical hill, which gives them a resemblance to the\r\ncircular ridges and central mountains before described. In some\r\ninstances, their margins are level with the general surface of the moon;\r\nbut, in most cases, they are encircled with a high annular ridge of\r\nmountains, marked with lofty peaks. Some of the larger of these cavities\r\ncontain smaller cavities of the same kind and form, particularly in\r\ntheir sides. The mountainous ridges which surround these cavities\r\nreflect the greatest quantity of light; and hence that region of the\r\nmoon in which they abound appears brighter than any other. From their\r\nlying in every possible direction, they appear, at and near the time of\r\nfull moon, like a number of brilliant streaks, or radiations. These\r\nradiations appear to converge towards a large brilliant spot,\r\nsurrounded by a faint shade, near the lower part of the moon, which is\r\nnamed Tycho,--a spot easily distinguished even by a small telescope. The\r\nspots named Kepler and Copernicus are each composed of a central spot\r\nwith luminous radiations.[8]\r\n\r\nThe broken surface and apparent geological structure of the moon has\r\nsuggested the opinion, that the moon has been subject to powerful\r\n_volcanic_ action. This opinion receives support from certain actual\r\nappearances of volcanic fires, which have at different times been\r\nobserved. In a total eclipse of the sun, the moon comes directly between\r\nus and that luminary, and presents her dark side towards us under\r\ncircumstances very favorable for observation. At such times, several\r\nastronomers, at different periods, have noticed bright spots, which they\r\ntook to be volcanoes. It must evidently require a large fire to be\r\nvisible at all, at such a distance; and even a burning spark, or point\r\nbut just visible in a large telescope, might be in fact a volcano raging\r\nlike Etna or Vesuvius. Still, as fires might be supposed to exist in the\r\nmoon from different causes, we should require some marks peculiar to\r\nvolcanic fires, to assure us that such was their origin in a given case.\r\nDr. Herschel examined this point with great attention, and with better\r\nmeans of observation than any of his predecessors enjoyed, and fully\r\nembraced the opinion that what he saw were volcanoes. In April, 1787, he\r\nrecords his observations as follows: \"I perceive three volcanoes in\r\ndifferent places in the dark part of the moon. Two of them are already\r\nnearly extinct, or otherwise in a state of going to break out; the third\r\nshows an eruption of fire or luminous matter.\" On the next night, he\r\nsays: \"The volcano burns with greater violence than last night; its\r\ndiameter cannot be less than three seconds; and hence the shining or\r\nburning matter must be above three miles in diameter. The appearance\r\nresembles a small piece of burning charcoal, when it is covered with a\r\nvery thin coat of white ashes; and it has a degree of brightness about\r\nas strong as that with which such a coal would be seen to glow in faint\r\ndaylight.\" That these were really volcanic fires, he considered further\r\nevident from the fact, that where a fire, supposed to have been\r\nvolcanic, had been burning, there was seen, after its extinction, an\r\naccumulation of matter, such as would arise from the production of a\r\ngreat quantity of lava, sufficient to form a mountain.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the moon has an _atmosphere_, although it is\r\ndifficult to obtain perfectly satisfactory evidence of its existence;\r\nfor granting the existence of an atmosphere bearing the same proportion\r\nto that planet as our atmosphere bears to the earth, its dimensions and\r\nits density would be so small, that we could detect its presence only by\r\nthe most refined observations. As our twilight is owing to the agency of\r\nour atmosphere, so, could we discern any appearance of twilight in the\r\nmoon, we should regard that fact as indicating that she is surrounded by\r\nan atmosphere. Or, when the moon covers the sun in a solar eclipse,\r\ncould we see around her circumference a faint luminous ring, indicating\r\nthat the sunlight shone through an aerial medium, we might likewise\r\ninfer the existence of such a medium. Such a faint ring of light has\r\nsometimes, as is supposed, been observed. Schroeter, a German\r\nastronomer, distinguished for the acuteness of his vision and his powers\r\nof observation in general, was very confident of having obtained, from\r\ndifferent sources, clear evidence of a lunar atmosphere. He concluded,\r\nthat the inferior or more dense part of the moon's atmosphere is not\r\nmore than fifteen hundred feet high, and that the entire height, at\r\nleast to the limit where it would be too rare to produce any of the\r\nphenomena which are relied on as proofs of its existence, is not more\r\nthan a mile.\r\n\r\nIt has been a question, much agitated among astronomers, whether there\r\nis _water_ in the moon. Analogy strongly inclines us to reply in the\r\naffirmative. But the analogy between the earth and the moon, as derived\r\nfrom all the particulars in which we can compare the two bodies, is too\r\nfeeble to warrant such a conclusion, and we must have recourse to other\r\nevidence, before we can decide the point. In the first place, then,\r\nthere is no positive evidence in favor of the existence of water in the\r\nmoon. Those extensive level regions, before spoken of, and denominated\r\nseas in the geography of this planet, have no other signs of being\r\nwater, except that they are level and dark. But both these particulars\r\nwould characterize an earthly plain, like the deserts of Arabia and\r\nAfrica. In the second place, were those dark regions composed of water,\r\nthe terminator would be entirely smooth where it passed over these\r\noceans or seas. It is indeed indented by few inequalities, compared with\r\nthose which it exhibits where it passes over the mountainous regions;\r\nbut still, the inequalities are too considerable to permit the\r\nconclusion, that these level spots are such perfect levels as water\r\nwould form. They do not appear to be more perfect levels than many plain\r\ncountries on the globe. The deep caverns, moreover, seen in those dusky\r\nspots which were supposed to be seas, are unfavorable to the supposition\r\nthat those regions are covered by water. In the third place, the face of\r\nthe moon, when illuminated by the sun and not obscured by the state of\r\nour own atmosphere, is always serene, and therefore free from clouds.\r\nClouds are objects of great extent; they frequently intercept light,\r\nlike solid bodies; and did they exist about the moon, we should\r\ncertainly see them, and should lose sight of certain parts of the lunar\r\ndisk which they covered. But neither position is true; we neither see\r\nany clouds about the moon, with our best telescopes, nor do we, by the\r\nintervention of clouds, ever lose sight of any portion of the moon when\r\nour own atmosphere is clear. But the want of clouds in the lunar\r\natmosphere almost necessarily implies the absence of water in the moon.\r\nThis planet is at the same distance from the sun as our own, and has, in\r\nthis respect, an equal opportunity to feel the influence of his rays.\r\nIts days are also twenty-seven times as long as ours, a circumstance\r\nwhich would augment the solar heat. When the pressure of the atmosphere\r\nis diminished on the surface of water, its tendency to pass into the\r\nstate of vapor is increased. Were the whole pressure of the atmosphere\r\nremoved from the surface of a lake, in a Summer's day, when the\r\ntemperature was no higher than seventy-two degrees, the water would\r\nbegin to boil. Now it is well ascertained, that if there be any\r\natmosphere about the moon, it is much lighter than ours, and presses on\r\nthe surface of that body with a proportionally small force. This\r\ncircumstance, therefore, would conspire with the other causes mentioned,\r\nto convert all the water of the moon into vapor, if we could suppose it\r\nto have existed at any given time.\r\n\r\nBut those, who are anxious to furnish the moon and other planets with\r\nall the accommodations which they find in our own, have a subterfuge in\r\nreadiness, to which they invariably resort in all cases like the\r\nforegoing. \"There may be,\" say they, \"some means, unknown to us,\r\nprovided for retaining water on the surface of the moon, and for\r\npreventing its being wasted by evaporation: perhaps it remains unaltered\r\nin quantity, imparting to the lunar regions perpetual verdure and\r\nfertility.\" To this I reply, that the bare possibility of a thing is but\r\nslight evidence of its reality; nor is such a condition possible, except\r\nby miracle. If they grant that the laws of Nature are the same in the\r\nmoon as in the earth, then, according to the foregoing reasoning, there\r\ncannot be water in the moon; but if they say that the laws of Nature are\r\nnot the same there as here, then we cannot reason at all respecting\r\nthem. One who resorts to a subterfuge of this kind ruins his own cause.\r\nHe argues the existence of water in the moon, from the analogy of that\r\nplanet to this. But if the laws of Nature are not the same there as\r\nhere, what becomes of his analogy? A liquid substance which would not\r\nevaporate by such a degree of solar heat as falls on the moon, which\r\nwould not evaporate the faster, in consequence of the diminished\r\natmospheric pressure which prevails there, could not be water, for it\r\nwould not have the properties of water, and things are known by their\r\nproperties. Whenever we desert the cardinal principle of the Newtonian\r\nphilosophy,--that the laws of Nature are uniform throughout all her\r\nrealms,--we wander in a labyrinth; all analogies are made void; all\r\nphysical reasonings cease; and imaginary possibilities or direct\r\nmiracles take the place of legitimate natural causes.\r\n\r\nOn the supposition that the moon is inhabited, the question has often\r\nbeen raised, whether we may hope that our telescopes will ever be so\r\nmuch improved, and our other means of observation so much augmented,\r\nthat we shall be able to discover either the lunar inhabitants or any of\r\ntheir works.\r\n\r\nThe improbability of our ever identifying _artificial structures_ in the\r\nmoon may be inferred from the fact, that a space a mile in diameter is\r\nthe least space that could be distinctly seen. Extensive works of art,\r\nas large cities, or the clearing up of large tracts of country for\r\nsettlement or tillage, might indeed afford some varieties of surface;\r\nbut they would be merely varieties of light and shade, and the\r\nindividual objects that occasioned them would probably never be\r\nrecognised by their distinctive characters. Thus, a building equal to\r\nthe great pyramid of Egypt, which covers a space less than the fifth of\r\na mile in diameter, would not be distinguished by its figure; indeed, it\r\nwould be a mere point. Still less is it probable that we shall ever\r\ndiscover any inhabitants in the moon. Were we to view the moon with a\r\ntelescope that magnifies ten thousand times, it would bring the moon\r\napparently ten thousand times nearer, and present it to the eye like a\r\nbody twenty-four miles off. But even this is a distance too great for us\r\nto see the works of man with distinctness. Moreover, from the nature of\r\nthe telescope itself, we can never hope to apply a magnifying power so\r\nhigh as that here supposed. As I explained to you, when speaking of the\r\ntelescope, whenever we increase the magnifying power of this instrument\r\nwe diminish its field of view, so that with very high magnifiers we can\r\nsee nothing but a point, such as a fixed star. We at the same time,\r\nalso, magnify the vapors and smoke of the atmosphere, and all the\r\nimperfections of the medium, which greatly obscures the object, and\r\nprevents our seeing it distinctly. Hence it is generally most\r\nsatisfactory to view the moon with low powers, which afford a large\r\nfield of view and give a clear light. With Clark's telescope, belonging\r\nto Yale College, we seldom gain any thing by applying to the moon a\r\nhigher power than one hundred and eighty, although the instrument admits\r\nof magnifiers as high as four hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nSome writers, however, suppose that possibly we may trace indications of\r\nlunar inhabitants in their works, and that they may in like manner\r\nrecognise the existence of the inhabitants of our planet. An author, who\r\nhas reflected much on subjects of this kind, reasons as follows: \"A\r\nnavigator who approaches within a certain distance of a small island,\r\nalthough he perceives no human being upon it, can judge with certainty\r\nthat it is inhabited, if he perceives human habitations, villages,\r\ncorn-fields, or other traces of cultivation. In like manner, if we could\r\nperceive changes or operations in the moon, which could be traced to the\r\nagency of intelligent beings, we should then obtain satisfactory\r\nevidence that such beings exist on that planet; and it is thought\r\npossible that such operations may be traced. A telescope which magnifies\r\ntwelve hundred times will enable us to perceive, as a visible point on\r\nthe surface of the moon, an object whose diameter is only about three\r\nhundred feet. Such an object is not larger than many of our public\r\nedifices; and therefore, were any such edifices rearing in the moon, or\r\nwere a town or city extending its boundaries, or were operations of this\r\ndescription carrying on, in a district where no such edifices had\r\npreviously been erected, such objects and operations might probably be\r\ndetected by a minute inspection. Were a multitude of living creatures\r\nmoving from place to place, in a body, or were they even encamping in an\r\nextensive plain, like a large army, or like a tribe of Arabs in the\r\ndesert, and afterwards removing, it is possible such changes might be\r\ntraced by the difference of shade or color, which such movements would\r\nproduce. In order to detect such minute objects and operations, it would\r\nbe requisite that the surface of the moon should be distributed among at\r\nleast a hundred astronomers, each having a spot or two allotted to him,\r\nas the object of his more particular investigation, and that the\r\nobservations be continued for a period of at least thirty or forty\r\nyears, during which time certain changes would probably be perceived,\r\narising either from physical causes, or from the operations of living\r\nagents.\"[9]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[8] Dick's 'Celestial Scenery,' Chapter IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE MOON.--PHASES.--HARVEST MOON.--LIBRATIONS.\r\n\r\n    \"First to the neighboring Moon this mighty key\r\n    Of nature he applied. Behold! it turned\r\n    The secret wards, it opened wide the course\r\n    And various aspects of the queen of night:\r\n    Whether she wanes into a scanty orb,\r\n    Or, waxing broad, with her pale shadowy light,\r\n    In a soft deluge overflows the sky.\"--_Thomson's Elegy._\r\n\r\n\r\nLET us now inquire into the revolutions of the moon around the earth,\r\nand the various changes she undergoes every month, called her _phases_,\r\nwhich depend on the different positions she assumes, with respect to the\r\nearth and the sun, in the course of her revolution.\r\n\r\nThe moon revolves about the earth from west to east. Her apparent orbit,\r\nas traced out on the face of the sky, is a great circle; but this fact\r\nwould not certainly prove that the orbit is really a circle, since, if\r\nit were an ellipse, or even a more irregular curve, the projection of\r\nit on the face of the sky would be a circle, as explained to you before.\r\n(See page 148.) The moon is comparatively so near to the earth, that her\r\napparent movements are very rapid, so that, by attentively watching her\r\nprogress in a clear night, we may see her move from star to star,\r\nchanging her place perceptibly, every few hours. The interval during\r\nwhich she goes through the entire circuit of the heavens, from any star\r\nuntil she comes round to the same star again, is called a _sidereal\r\nmonth_, and consists of about twenty-seven and one fourth days. The time\r\nwhich intervenes between one new moon and another is called a _synodical\r\nmonth_, and consists of nearly twenty-nine and a half days. A new moon\r\noccurs when the sun and moon meet in the same part of the heavens; but\r\nthe sun as well as the moon is apparently travelling eastward, and\r\nnearly at the rate of one degree a day, and consequently, during the\r\ntwenty-seven days while the moon has been going round the earth, the sun\r\nhas been going forward about the same number of degrees in the same\r\ndirection. Hence, when the moon comes round to the part of the heavens\r\nwhere she passed the sun last, she does not find him there, but must go\r\non more than two days, before she comes up with him again.\r\n\r\nThe moon does not pursue precisely the same track around the earth as\r\nthe sun does, in his apparent annual motion, though she never deviates\r\nfar from that track. The inclination of her orbit to the ecliptic is\r\nonly about five degrees, and of course the moon is never seen further\r\nfrom the ecliptic than about that distance, and she is commonly much\r\nnearer to the ecliptic than five degrees. We may therefore see nearly\r\nwhat is the situation of the ecliptic in our evening sky at any\r\nparticular time of year, just by watching the path which the moon\r\npursues, from night to night, from new to full moon.\r\n\r\nThe two points where the moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic are called\r\nher _nodes_. They are the intersections of the lunar and solar orbits,\r\nas the equinoxes are the intersections of the equinoctial and ecliptic,\r\nand, like the latter, are one hundred and eighty degrees apart.\r\n\r\nThe changes of the moon, commonly called her _phases_, arise from\r\ndifferent portions of her illuminated side being turned towards the\r\nearth at different times. When the moon is first seen after the setting\r\nsun, her form is that of a bright crescent, on the side of the disk next\r\nto the sun, while the other portions of the disk shine with a feeble\r\nlight, reflected to the moon from the earth. Every night, we observe the\r\nmoon to be further and further eastward of the sun, until, when she has\r\nreached an elongation from the sun of ninety degrees, half her visible\r\ndisk is enlightened, and she is said to be in her _first quarter_. The\r\nterminator, or line which separates the illuminated from the dark part\r\nof the moon, is convex towards the sun from the new to the first\r\nquarter, and the moon is said to be _horned_. The extremities of the\r\ncrescent are called _cusps_. At the first quarter, the terminator\r\nbecomes a straight line, coinciding with the diameter of the disk; but\r\nafter passing this point, the terminator becomes concave towards the\r\nsun, bounding that side of the moon by an elliptical curve, when the\r\nmoon is said to be _gibbous_. When the moon arrives at the distance of\r\none hundred and eighty degrees from the sun, the entire circle is\r\nilluminated, and the moon is _full_. She is then _in opposition_ to the\r\nsun, rising about the time the sun sets. For a week after the full, the\r\nmoon appears gibbous again, until, having arrived within ninety degrees\r\nof the sun, she resumes the same form as at the first quarter, being\r\nthen at her _third quarter_. From this time until new moon, she exhibits\r\nagain the form of a crescent before the rising sun, until, approaching\r\nher _conjunction_ with the sun, her narrow thread of light is lost in\r\nthe solar blaze; and finally, at the moment of passing the sun, the dark\r\nside is wholly turned towards us, and for some time we lose sight of the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nBy inspecting Fig. 38, (where T represents the earth, A, B, C, &c., the\r\nmoon in her orbit, and _a_, _b_, _c_, &c., her phases, as seen in the\r\nheavens,) we shall easily see how all these changes occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless observed, that the moon appears much further in the\r\nsouth at one time than at another, when of the same age. This is owing\r\nto the fact that the ecliptic, and of course the moon's path, which is\r\nalways very near it, is differently situated with respect to the\r\n_horizon_, at a given time of night, at different seasons of the year.\r\nThis you will see at once, by turning to an artificial globe, and\r\nobserving how the ecliptic stands with respect to the horizon, at\r\ndifferent periods of the revolution. Thus, if we place the two\r\nequinoctial points in the eastern and western horizon, Libra being in\r\nthe west, it will represent the position of the ecliptic at sunset in\r\nthe month of September, when the sun is crossing the equator; and at\r\nthat season of the year, the moon's path through our evening sky, one\r\nevening after another, from new to full, will be nearly along the same\r\nroute, crossing the meridian nearly at right angles. But if we place the\r\nWinter solstice, or first degree of Capricorn, in the western horizon,\r\nand the first degree of Cancer in the eastern, then the position of the\r\necliptic will be very oblique to the meridian, the Winter solstice being\r\nvery far in the southwest, and the Summer solstice very far in the\r\nnortheast; and the course of the moon from new to full will be nearly\r\nalong this track. Keeping these things in mind, we may easily see why\r\nthe moon runs sometimes high and sometimes low. Recollect, also, that\r\nthe new moon is always in the same part of the heavens with the sun, and\r\nthat the full moon is in the opposite part of the heavens from the sun.\r\nNow, when the sun is at the Winter solstice, it sets far in the\r\nsouthwest, and accordingly the new moon runs very low; but the full\r\nmoon, being in the opposite tropic, which rises far in the northeast,\r\nruns very high, as is known to be the case in mid-winter. But now take\r\nthe position of the ecliptic in mid-summer. Then, at sunset, the tropic\r\nof Cancer is in the northwest, and the tropic of Capricorn in the\r\nsoutheast; consequently, the new moons run high and the full moons low.\r\n\r\nIt is a natural consequence of this arrangement, to render the moon's\r\nlight the most beneficial to us, by giving it to us in greatest\r\nabundance, when we have least of the sun's light, and giving it to us\r\nmost sparingly, when the sun's light is greatest. Thus, during the long\r\nnights of Winter, the full moon runs high, and continues a very long\r\ntime above the horizon; while in mid-summer, the full moon runs low, and\r\nis above the horizon for a much shorter period. This arrangement\r\noperates very favorably to the inhabitants of the polar regions. At the\r\nseason when the sun is absent, and they have constant night, then the\r\nmoon, during the second and third quarters, embracing the season of full\r\nmoon, is continually above the horizon, compensating in no small degree\r\nfor the absence of the sun; while, during the Summer months, when the\r\nsun is constantly above the horizon, and the light of the moon is not\r\nneeded, then she is above the horizon during the first and last\r\nquarters, when her light is least, affording at that time her greatest\r\nlight to the inhabitants of the other hemisphere, from whom the sun is\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the Autumnal equinox, the moon, when near her full,\r\nrises about sunset a number of nights in succession. This occasions a\r\nremarkable number of brilliant moonlight evenings; and as this is, in\r\nEngland, the period of harvest, the phenomenon is called the _harvest\r\nmoon_. Its return is celebrated, particularly among the peasantry, by\r\nfestive dances, and kept as a festival, called the _harvest home_,--an\r\noccasion often alluded to by the British poets. Thus Henry Kirke White:\r\n\r\n    \"Moon of harvest, herald mild\r\n    Of plenty, rustic labor's child,\r\n    Hail, O hail! I greet thy beam,\r\n    As soft it trembles o'er the stream,\r\n    And gilds the straw-thatch'd hamlet wide,\r\n    Where innocence and peace reside;\r\n    'Tis thou that glad'st with joy the rustic throng,\r\n    Promptest the tripping dance, th' exhilarating song.\"\r\n\r\nTo understand the reason of the harvest moon, we will, as before,\r\nconsider the moon's orbit as coinciding with the ecliptic, because we\r\nmay then take the ecliptic, as it is drawn on the artificial globe, to\r\nrepresent that orbit. We will also bear in mind, (what has been fully\r\nillustrated under the last head,) that, since the ecliptic cuts the\r\nmeridian obliquely, while all the circles of diurnal revolution cut it\r\nperpendicularly, different portions of the ecliptic will cut the horizon\r\nat different angles. Thus, when the equinoxes are in the horizon, the\r\necliptic makes a very small angle with the horizon; whereas, when the\r\nsolstitial points are in the horizon, the same angle is far greater. In\r\nthe former case, a body moving eastward in the ecliptic, and being at\r\nthe eastern horizon at sunset, would descend but a little way below the\r\nhorizon in moving over many degrees of the ecliptic. Now, this is just\r\nthe case of the moon at the time of the harvest home, about the time of\r\nthe Autumnal equinox. The sun being then in Libra, and the moon, when\r\nfull, being of course opposite to the sun, or in Aries; and moving\r\neastward, in or near the ecliptic, at the rate of about thirteen degrees\r\nper day, would descend but a small distance below the horizon for five\r\nor six days in succession; that is for two or three days before, and the\r\nsame number of days after, the full; and would consequently rise during\r\nall these evenings nearly at the same time, namely, a little before, or\r\na little after, sunset, so as to afford a remarkable succession of fine\r\nmoonlight evenings.\r\n\r\nThe moon _turns on her axis_ in the same time in which she revolves\r\naround the earth. This is known by the moon's always keeping nearly the\r\nsame face towards us, as is indicated by the telescope, which could not\r\nhappen unless her revolution on her axis kept pace with her motion in\r\nher orbit. Take an apple, to represent the moon; stick a knittingneedle\r\nthrough it, in the direction of the stem, to represent the axis, in\r\nwhich case the two eyes of the apple will aptly represent the poles.\r\nThrough the poles cut a line around the apple, dividing it into two\r\nhemispheres, and mark them, so as to be readily distinguished from each\r\nother. Now place a candle on the table, to represent the earth, and\r\nholding the apple by the knittingneedle, carry it round the candle, and\r\nyou will see that, unless you make the apple turn round on the axis as\r\nyou carry it about the candle, it will present different sides towards\r\nthe candle; and that, in order to make it always present the same side,\r\nit will be necessary to make it revolve exactly once on its axis, while\r\nit is going round the circle,--the revolution on its axis always keeping\r\nexact pace with the motion in its orbit. The same thing will be\r\nobserved, if you walk around a tree, always keeping your face towards\r\nthe tree. If you have your face towards the tree when you set out, and\r\nwalk round without turning, when you have reached the opposite side of\r\nthe tree, your back will be towards it, and you will find that, in order\r\nto keep your face constantly towards the tree, it will be necessary to\r\nturn yourself round on your heel at the same rate as you go forward.\r\n\r\nSince, however, the motion of the moon on its axis is uniform, while the\r\nmotion in its orbit is unequal, the moon does in fact reveal to us a\r\nlittle sometimes of one side and sometimes of the other. Thus if, while\r\ncarrying the apple round the candle, you carry it forward a little\r\nfaster than the rate at which it turns on its axis, a portion of the\r\nhemisphere usually out of sight is brought into view on one side; or if\r\nthe apple is moved forward slower than it is turned on its axis, a\r\nportion of the same hemisphere comes into view on the other side. These\r\nappearances are called the moon's _librations in longitude_. The moon\r\nhas also a _libration in latitude_;--so called, because in one part of\r\nher revolution more of the region around one of the poles comes into\r\nview, and, in another part of the revolution, more of the region around\r\nthe other pole, which gives the appearance of a tilting motion to the\r\nmoon's axis. This is owing to the fact, that the moon's axis is inclined\r\nto the plane of her orbit. If, in the experiment with the apple, you\r\nhold the knittingneedle parallel to the candle, (in which case the axis\r\nwill be perpendicular to the plane of revolution,) the candle will shine\r\nupon both poles during the whole circuit, and an eye situated where the\r\ncandle is would constantly see both poles; but now incline the needle\r\ntowards the plane of revolution, and carry it round, always keeping it\r\nparallel to itself, and you will observe that the two poles will be\r\nalternately in and out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe moon exhibits another appearance of this kind, called her _diurnal\r\nlibration_, depending on the daily rotation of the spectator. She turns\r\nthe same face towards the _centre_ of the earth only, whereas we view\r\nher from the surface. When she is on the meridian, we view her disk\r\nnearly as though we viewed it from the centre of the earth, and hence,\r\nin this situation, it is subject to little change; but when she is near\r\nthe horizon, our circle of vision takes in more of the upper limb than\r\nwould be presented to a spectator at the centre of the earth. Hence,\r\nfrom this cause, we see a portion of one limb while the moon is rising,\r\nwhich is gradually lost sight of, and we see a portion of the opposite\r\nlimb, as the moon declines to the west. You will remark that neither of\r\nthe foregoing changes implies any actual motion in the moon, but that\r\neach arises from a change of position in the spectator. Since the\r\nsuccession of day and night depends on the revolution of a planet on its\r\nown axis, and it takes the moon twenty-nine and a half days to perform\r\nthis revolution, so that the sun shall go from the meridian of any place\r\nand return to the same meridian again, of course the lunar day occupies\r\nthis long period. So protracted an exposure to the sun's rays,\r\nespecially in the equatorial regions of the moon, must occasion an\r\nexcessive accumulation of heat; and so long an absence of the sun must\r\noccasion a corresponding degree of cold. A spectator on the side of the\r\nmoon which is opposite to us would never see the earth, but one on the\r\nside next to us would see the earth constantly in his firmament,\r\nundergoing a gradual succession of changes, corresponding to those which\r\nthe moon exhibits to the earth, but in the reverse order. Thus, when it\r\nis full moon to us, the earth, as seen from the moon, is then in\r\nconjunction with the sun, and of course presents her dark side to the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, an inhabitant of the moon would see a crescent,\r\nresembling our new moon, which would in like manner increase and go\r\nthrough all the changes, from new to full, and from full to new, as we\r\nsee them in the moon. There are, however, in the two cases, several\r\nstriking points of difference. In the first place, instead of\r\ntwenty-nine and a half days, all these changes occur in one lunar day\r\nand night. During the first and last quarters, the changes would occur\r\nin the day-time; but during the second and third quarters, during the\r\nnight. By this arrangement, the lunarians would enjoy the greatest\r\npossible benefit from the light afforded by the earth, since in the half\r\nof her revolution where she appears to them as full, she would be\r\npresent while the sun was absent, and would afford her least light while\r\nthe sun was present. In the second place, the earth would appear\r\nthirteen times as large to a spectator on the moon as the moon appears\r\nto us, and would afford nearly the same proportion of light, so that\r\ntheir long nights must be continually cheered by an extraordinary degree\r\nof light derived from this source; and if the full moon is hailed by our\r\npoets as \"refulgent lamp of night,\"[10] with how much more reason might\r\na lunarian exult thus, in view of the splendid orb that adorns his\r\nnocturnal sky! In the third place, the earth, as viewed from any\r\nparticular place on the moon, would occupy invariably the same part of\r\nthe heavens. For while the rotation of the moon on her axis from west to\r\neast would appear to make the earth (as the moon does to us) revolve\r\nfrom east to west, the corresponding progress of the moon in her orbit\r\nwould make the earth appear to revolve from west to east; and as these\r\ntwo motions are equal, their united effect would be to keep the moon\r\napparently stationary in the sky. Thus, a spectator at E, Fig. 38, page\r\n175, in the middle of the disk that is turned towards the earth, would\r\nhave the earth constantly on his meridian, and at E, the conjunction of\r\nthe earth and sun would occur at mid-day; but when the moon arrived at\r\nG, the same place would be on the margin of the circle of illumination,\r\nand will have the sun in the horizon; but the earth would still be on\r\nhis meridian and in quadrature. In like manner, a place situated on the\r\nmargin of the circle of illumination, when the moon is at E, would have\r\nthe earth in the horizon; and the same place would always see the earth\r\nin the horizon, except the slight variations that would occur from the\r\nlibrations of the moon. In the fourth place, the earth would present to\r\na spectator on the moon none of that uniformity of aspect which the moon\r\npresents to us, but would exhibit an appearance exceedingly diversified.\r\nThe comparatively rapid rotation of the earth, repeated fifteen times\r\nduring a lunar night, would present, in rapid succession, a view of our\r\nseas, oceans, continents, and mountains, all diversified by our clouds,\r\nstorms, and volcanoes.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Dick's 'Celestial Scenery.'\r\n\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n    \"As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,\r\n    O'er heaven's clear azure sheds her sacred light,\r\n    When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,\r\n    And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene,\r\n    Around her throne the vivid planets roll,\r\n    And stars unnumbered gild the glowing pole;\r\n    O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,\r\n    And tip with silver every mountain's head;\r\n    Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,\r\n    A flood of glory bursts from all the skies;\r\n    The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,\r\n    Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.\"\r\n\r\n    _Pope's Homer._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMOON'S ORBIT.--HER IRREGULARITIES.\r\n\r\n    \"Some say the zodiac constellations\r\n    Have long since left their antique stations,\r\n    Above a sign, and prove the same\r\n    In Taurus now, once in the Ram;\r\n    That in twelve hundred years and odd,\r\n    The sun has left his ancient road,\r\n    And nearer to the earth is come,\r\n    'Bove fifty thousand miles from home.\"--_Hudibras._\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have thus far contemplated the revolution of the moon around the\r\nearth as though the earth were at rest. But in order to have just ideas\r\nrespecting the moon's motions, we must recollect that the moon likewise\r\nrevolves along with the earth around the sun. It is sometimes said that\r\nthe earth _carries_ the moon along with her, in her annual revolution.\r\nThis language may convey an erroneous idea; for the moon, as well as the\r\nearth, revolves around the sun under the influence of two forces, which\r\nare independent of the earth, and would continue her motion around the\r\nsun, were the earth removed out of the way. Indeed, the moon is\r\nattracted towards the sun two and one fifth times more than towards the\r\nearth, and would abandon the earth, were not the latter also carried\r\nalong with her by the same forces. So far as the sun acts equally on\r\nboth bodies, the motion with respect to each other would not be\r\ndisturbed. Because the gravity of the moon towards the sun is found to\r\nbe greater, at the conjunction, than her gravity towards the earth, some\r\nhave apprehended that, if the doctrine of universal gravitation is true,\r\nthe moon ought necessarily to abandon the earth. In order to understand\r\nthe reason why it does not do thus, we must reflect, that, when a body\r\nis revolving in its orbit under the influence of the projectile force\r\nand gravity, whatever diminishes the force of gravity, while that of\r\nprojection remains the same, causes the body to approach nearer to the\r\ntangent of her orbit, and of course to recede from the centre; and\r\nwhatever increases the amount of gravity, carries the body towards the\r\ncentre. Thus, in Fig. 33, page 152, if, with a certain force of\r\nprojection acting in the direction A B, and of attraction, in the\r\ndirection A C, the attraction which caused a body to move in the line A\r\nD were diminished, it would move nearer to the tangent, as in A E, or A\r\nF. Now, when the moon is in conjunction, her gravity towards the earth\r\nacts in opposition to that towards the sun, (see Fig. 38, page 175,)\r\nwhile her velocity remains too great to carry her with what force\r\nremains, in a circle about the sun, and she therefore recedes from the\r\nsun, and commences her revolution around the earth. On arriving at the\r\nopposition, the gravity of the earth conspires with that of the sun, and\r\nthe moon's projectile force being less than that required to make her\r\nrevolve in a circular orbit, when attracted towards the sun by the sum\r\nof these forces, she accordingly begins to approach the sun, and\r\ndescends again to the conjunction.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of the sun, however, being every where greater than that\r\nof the earth, the actual path of the moon around the sun is every where\r\nconcave towards the latter. Still, the elliptical path of the moon\r\naround the earth is to be conceived of, in the same way as though both\r\nbodies were at rest with respect to the sun. Thus, while a steam-boat is\r\npassing _swiftly_ around an island, and a man is walking _slowly_ around\r\na post in the cabin, the line which he describes in space between the\r\nforward motion of the boat and his circular motion around the post, may\r\nbe every where concave towards the island, while his path around the\r\npost will still be the same as though both were at rest. A nail in the\r\nrim of a coach-wheel will turn around the axis of the wheel, when the\r\ncoach has a forward motion, in the same manner as when the coach is at\r\nrest, although the line actually described by the nail will be the\r\nresultant of both motions, and very different from either.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto regarded the moon as describing a great circle on the\r\nface of the sky, such being the visible orbit, as seen by projection.\r\nBut, on a more exact investigation, it is found that her orbit is not a\r\ncircle, and that her motions are subject to very numerous\r\nirregularities. These will be best understood in connexion with the\r\ncauses on which they depend. The law of universal gravitation has been\r\napplied with wonderful success to their developement, and its results\r\nhave conspired with those of long-continued observation, to furnish the\r\nmeans of ascertaining with great exactness the place of the moon in the\r\nheavens, at any given instant of time, past or future, and thus to\r\nenable astronomers to determine longitudes, to calculate eclipses, and\r\nto solve other problems of the highest interest. The whole number of\r\nirregularities to which the moon is subject is not less than sixty, but\r\nthe greater part are so small as to be hardly deserving of attention;\r\nbut as many as thirty require to be estimated and allowed for, before we\r\ncan ascertain the exact place of the moon at any given time. You will be\r\nable to understand something of the cause of these irregularities, if\r\nyou first gain a distinct idea of the mutual actions of the sun, the\r\nmoon, and the earth. The irregularities in the moon's motions are due\r\nchiefly to the disturbing influence of the sun, which operates in two\r\nways; first, by acting unequally on the earth and moon; and secondly, by\r\nacting obliquely on the moon, on account of the inclination of her orbit\r\nto the ecliptic. If the sun acted equally on the earth and moon, and\r\nalways in parallel lines, this action would serve only to restrain them\r\nin their annual motions around the sun, and would not affect their\r\nactions on each other, or their motions about their common centre of\r\ngravity. In that case, if they were allowed to fall towards the sun,\r\nthey would fall equally, and their respective situations would not be\r\naffected by their descending equally towards it. But, because the moon\r\nis nearer the sun in one half of her orbit than the earth is, and in the\r\nother half of her orbit is at a greater distance than the earth from the\r\nsun, while the power of gravity is always greater at a less distance; it\r\nfollows, that in one half of her orbit the moon is more attracted than\r\nthe earth towards the sun, and, in the other half, less attracted than\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nTo see the effects of this process, let us suppose that the projectile\r\nmotions of the earth and moon were destroyed, and that they were allowed\r\nto fall freely towards the sun. (See Fig. 38, page 175.) If the moon was\r\nin conjunction with the sun, or in that part of her orbit which is\r\nnearest to him, the moon would be more attracted than the earth, and\r\nfall with greater velocity towards the sun; so that the distance of the\r\nmoon from the earth would be increased by the fall. If the moon was in\r\nopposition, or in the part of her orbit which is furthest from the sun,\r\nshe would be less attracted than the earth by the sun, and would fall\r\nwith a less velocity, and be left behind; so that the distance of the\r\nmoon from the earth would be increased in this case, also. If the moon\r\nwas in one of the quarters, then the earth and the moon being both\r\nattracted towards the centre of the sun, they would both descend\r\ndirectly towards that centre, and, by approaching it, they would\r\nnecessarily at the same time approach each other, and in this case their\r\ndistance from each other would be diminished. Now, whenever the action\r\nof the sun would increase their distance, if they were allowed to fall\r\ntowards the sun, then the sun's action, by endeavoring to separate them,\r\ndiminishes their gravity to each other; whenever the sun's action would\r\ndiminish the distance, then it increases their mutual gravitation.\r\nHence, in the conjunction and opposition, their gravity towards each\r\nother is diminished by the action of the sun, while in the quadratures\r\nit is increased. But it must be remembered, that it is not the total\r\naction of the sun on them that disturbs their motions, but only that\r\npart of it which tends at one time to separate them, and at another time\r\nto bring them nearer together. The other and far greater part has no\r\nother effect than to retain them in their annual course around the sun.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the lunar irregularities was first investigated by Sir\r\nIsaac Newton, in conformity with his doctrine of universal gravitation,\r\nand the explanation was first published in the 'Principia;' but, as it\r\nwas given in a mathematical dress, there were at that age very few\r\npersons capable of reading or understanding it. Several eminent\r\nindividuals, therefore, undertook to give a popular explanation of these\r\ndifficult points. Among Newton's contemporaries, the best commentator\r\nwas M'Laurin, a Scottish astronomer, who published a large work entitled\r\n'M'Laurin's Account of Sir Isaac Newton's Discoveries.' No writer of his\r\nown day, and, in my opinion, no later commentator, has equalled\r\nM'Laurin, in reducing to common apprehension the leading principles of\r\nthe doctrine of gravitation, and the explanation it affords of the\r\nmotions of the heavenly bodies. To this writer I am indebted for the\r\npreceding easy explanation of the irregularities of the moon's motions,\r\nas well as for several other illustrations of the same sublime doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe figure of the moon's orbit is an ellipse. We have before seen, that\r\nthe earth's orbit around the sun is of the same figure; and we shall\r\nhereafter see this to be true of all the planetary orbits. The path of\r\nthe earth, however, departs very little from a circle; that of the moon\r\ndiffers materially from a circle, being considerably longer one way than\r\nthe other. Were the orbit a circle having the earth in the centre, then\r\nthe radius vector, or line drawn from the centre of the moon to the\r\ncentre of the earth, would always be of the same length; but it is found\r\nthat the length of the radius vector is only fifty-six times the radius\r\nof the earth when the moon is nearest to us, while it is sixty-four\r\ntimes that radius when the moon is furthest from us. The point in the\r\nmoon's orbit nearest the earth is called her _perigee_; the point\r\nfurthest from the earth, her _apogee_. We always know when the moon is\r\nat one of these points, by her apparent diameter or apparent velocity;\r\nfor, when at the perigee, her diameter is greater than at any time, and\r\nher motion most rapid; and, on the other hand, her diameter is least,\r\nand her motion slowest, when she is at her apogee.\r\n\r\nThe moon's nodes constantly shift their positions in the ecliptic, from\r\neast to west, at the rate of about nineteen and a half degrees every\r\nyear, returning to the same points once in eighteen and a half years. In\r\norder to understand what is meant by this backward motion of the nodes,\r\nyou must have very distinctly in mind the meaning of the terms\r\nthemselves; and if, at any time, you should be at a loss about the\r\nsignification of any word that is used in expressing an astronomical\r\nproposition, I would advise you to turn back to the previous definition\r\nof that term, and revive its meaning clearly in the mind, before you\r\nproceed any further. In the present case, you will recollect that the\r\nmoon's nodes are the two points where her orbit cuts the plane of the\r\necliptic. Suppose the great circle of the ecliptic marked out on the\r\nface of the sky in a distinct line, and let us observe, at any given\r\ntime, the exact moment when the moon crosses this line, which we will\r\nsuppose to be close to a certain star; then, on its next return to that\r\npart of the heavens, we shall find that it crosses the ecliptic sensibly\r\nto the westward of that star, and so on, further and further to the\r\nwestward, every time it crosses the ecliptic at either node. This fact\r\nis expressed by saying that _the nodes retrograde on the ecliptic_;\r\nsince any motion from east to west, being contrary to the order of the\r\nsigns, is called retrograde. The line which joins these two points, or\r\nthe line of the nodes, is also said to have a retrograde motion, or to\r\nrevolve from east to west once in eighteen and a half years.\r\n\r\nThe _line of the apsides_ of the moon's orbit revolves from west to\r\neast, through her whole course, in about nine years. You will recollect\r\nthat the apsides of an elliptical orbit are the two extremities of the\r\nlonger axis of the ellipse; corresponding to the perihelion and aphelion\r\nof bodies revolving about the sun, or to the perigee and apogee of a\r\nbody revolving about the earth. If, in any revolution of the moon, we\r\nshould accurately mark the place in the heavens where the moon is\r\nnearest the earth, (which may be known by the moon's apparent diameter\r\nbeing then greatest,) we should find that, at the next revolution, it\r\nwould come to its perigee a little further eastward than before, and so\r\non, at every revolution, until, after nine years, it would come to its\r\nperigee nearly at the same point as at first. This fact is expressed by\r\nsaying, that the perigee, and of course the apogee, revolves, and that\r\nthe line which joins these two points, or the line of the apsides, also\r\nrevolves.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the irregularities that attend the motions of\r\nthe moon. These and a few others were first discovered by actual\r\nobservation and have been long known; but a far greater number of lunar\r\nirregularities have been made known by following out all the\r\nconsequences of the law of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nThe moon may be regarded as a body endeavoring to make its way around\r\nthe earth, but as subject to be continually impeded, or diverted from\r\nits main course, by the action of the sun and of the earth; sometimes\r\nacting in concert and sometimes in opposition to each other. Now, by\r\nexactly estimating the amount of these respective forces, and\r\nascertaining their resultant or combined effect, in any given case, the\r\ndirection and velocity of the moon's motion may be accurately\r\ndetermined. But to do this has required the highest powers of the human\r\nmind, aided by all the wonderful resources of mathematics. Yet, so\r\nconsistent is truth with itself, that, where some minute inequality in\r\nthe moon's motions is developed at the end of a long and intricate\r\nmathematical process, it invariably happens, that, on pointing the\r\ntelescope to the moon, and watching its progress through the skies, we\r\nmay actually see her commit the same irregularities, unless (as is the\r\ncase with many of them) they are too minute to be matters of\r\nobservation, being beyond the powers of our vision, even when aided by\r\nthe best telescopes. But the truth of the law of gravitation, and of the\r\nresults it gives, when followed out by a chain of mathematical\r\nreasoning, is fully confirmed, even in these minutest matters, by the\r\nfact that the moon's place in the heavens, when thus determined, always\r\ncorresponds, with wonderful exactness, to the place which she is\r\nactually observed to occupy at that time.\r\n\r\nThe mind, that was first able to elicit from the operations of Nature\r\nthe law of universal gravitation, and afterwards to apply it to the\r\ncomplete explanation of all the irregular wanderings of the moon, must\r\nhave given evidence of intellectual powers far elevated above those of\r\nthe majority of the human race. We need not wonder, therefore, that such\r\nhomage is now paid to the genius of Newton,--an admiration which has\r\nbeen continually increasing, as new discoveries have been made by\r\ntracing out new consequences of the law of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nThe chief object of astronomical _tables_ is to give the amount of all\r\nthe irregularities that attend the motions of the heavenly bodies, by\r\nestimating the separate value of each, under all the different\r\ncircumstances in which a body can be placed. Thus, with respect to the\r\nmoon, before we can determine accurately the distance of the moon from\r\nthe vernal equinox, that is, her longitude at any given moment, we must\r\nbe able to make exact allowances for all her irregularities which would\r\naffect her longitude. These are in all no less than sixty, though most\r\nof them are so exceedingly minute, that it is not common to take into\r\nthe account more than twenty-eight or thirty. The values of these are\r\nall given in the lunar tables; and in finding the moon's place, at any\r\ngiven time, we proceed as follows: We first find what her place would be\r\non the supposition that she moves uniformly in a circle. This gives her\r\n_mean_ place. We next apply the various corrections for her irregular\r\nmotions; that is, we apply the _equations_, subtracting some and adding\r\nothers, and thus we find her _true_ place.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical tables have been carried to such an astonishing degree\r\nof accuracy, that it is said, by the highest authority, that an\r\nastronomer could now predict, for a thousand years to come, the precise\r\nmoment of the passage of any one of the stars over the meridian wire of\r\nthe telescope of his transit-instrument, with such a degree of accuracy,\r\nthat the error would not be so great as to remove the object through an\r\nangular space corresponding to the semidiameter of the finest wire that\r\ncould be made; and a body which, by the tables, ought to appear in the\r\ntransit-instrument in the middle of that wire, would in no case be\r\nremoved to its outer edge. The astronomer, the mathematician, and the\r\nartist, have united their powers to produce this great result. The\r\nastronomer has collected the data, by long-continued and most accurate\r\nobservations on the actual motions of the heavenly bodies, from night to\r\nnight, and from year to year; the mathematician has taken these data,\r\nand applied to them the boundless resources of geometry and the\r\ncalculus; and, finally, the instrument-maker has furnished the means,\r\nnot only of verifying these conclusions, but of discovering new truths,\r\nas the foundation of future reasonings.\r\n\r\nSince the points where the moon crosses the ecliptic, or the moon's\r\nnodes, constantly shift their positions about nineteen and a half\r\ndegrees to the westward, every year, the sun, in his annual progress in\r\nthe ecliptic, will go from the node round to the same node again in less\r\ntime than a year, since the node goes to meet him nineteen and a half\r\ndegrees to the west of the point where they met before. It would have\r\ntaken the sun about nineteen days to have passed over this arc; and\r\nconsequently, the interval between two successive conjunctions between\r\nthe sun and the moon's node is about nineteen days shorter than the\r\nsolar year of three hundred and sixty-five days; that is, it is about\r\nthree hundred and forty-six days; or, more exactly, it is 346.619851\r\ndays. The time from one new moon to another is 29.5305887 days. Now,\r\nnineteen of the former periods are almost exactly equal to two hundred\r\nand twenty-three of the latter:\r\n\r\n    For 346.619851 ×  19=6585.78 days=18 y. 10 d.\r\n    And 29.5305887 × 223=6585.32   \" = \" \"  \" \"\r\n\r\nHence, if the sun and moon were to leave the moon's node together, after\r\nthe sun had been round to the same node nineteen times, the moon would\r\nhave made very nearly two hundred and twenty-three conjunctions with the\r\nsun. If, therefore, she was in conjunction with the sun at the beginning\r\nof this period, she would be in conjunction again at the end of it; and\r\nall things relating to the sun, the moon, and the node, would be\r\nrestored to the same relative situation as before, and the sun and moon\r\nwould start again, to repeat the same phenomena, arising out of these\r\nrelations, as occurred in the preceding period, and in the same order.\r\nNow, when the sun and moon meet at the moon's node, an eclipse of the\r\nsun happens; and during the entire period of eighteen and a half years\r\neclipses will happen, nearly in the same manner as they did at\r\ncorresponding times in the preceding period. Thus, if there was a great\r\neclipse of the sun on the fifth year of one of these periods, a similar\r\neclipse (usually differing somewhat in magnitude) might be expected on\r\nthe fifth year of the next period. Hence this period, consisting of\r\nabout eighteen years and ten days, under the name of the _Saros_, was\r\nused by the Chaldeans, and other ancient nations, in predicting\r\neclipses. It was probably by this means that Thales, a Grecian\r\nastronomer who flourished six hundred years before the Christian era,\r\npredicted an eclipse of the sun. Herodotus, the old historian of Greece,\r\nrelates that the day was suddenly changed into night, and that Thales of\r\nMiletus had foretold that a great eclipse was to happen _this year_. It\r\nwas therefore, at that age, considered as a distinguished feat to\r\npredict even the year in which an eclipse was to happen. This eclipse is\r\nmemorable in ancient history, from its having terminated the war between\r\nthe Lydians and the Medes, both parties being smitten with such\r\nindications of the wrath of the gods.\r\n\r\nThe _Metonic Cycle_ has sometimes been confounded with the Saros, but it\r\nis not the same with it, nor was the period used, like the Saros, for\r\nforetelling eclipses, but for ascertaining the _age_ of the moon at any\r\ngiven period. It consisted of nineteen tropical years, during which time\r\nthere are exactly two hundred and thirty-five new moons; so that, at the\r\nend of this period, the new moons will recur at seasons of the year\r\ncorresponding exactly to those of the preceding cycle. If, for example,\r\na new moon fell at the time of the vernal equinox, in one cycle,\r\nnineteen years afterwards it would occur again at the same equinox; or,\r\nif it had happened ten days after the equinox, in one cycle, it would\r\nalso happen ten days after the equinox, nineteen years afterwards. By\r\nregistering, therefore, the exact days of any cycle at which the new or\r\nfull moons occurred, such a calendar would show on what days these\r\nevents would occur in any other cycle; and, since the regulation of\r\ngames, feasts, and fasts, has been made very extensively, both in\r\nancient and modern times, according to new or full moons, such a\r\ncalendar becomes very convenient for finding the day on which the new or\r\nfull moon required takes place. Suppose, for example, it were decreed\r\nthat a festival should be held on the day of the first full moon after\r\nthe Vernal equinox. Then, to find on what day that would happen, in any\r\ngiven year, we have only to see what year it is of the lunar cycle; for\r\nthe day will be the same as it was in the corresponding year of the\r\ncalendar which records all the full moons of the cycle for each year,\r\nand the respective days on which they happen.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians adopted the metonic cycle four hundred and thirty-three\r\nyears before the Christian era, for the regulation of their calendars,\r\nand had it inscribed in letters of gold on the walls of the temple of\r\nMinerva. Hence the term _golden number_, still found in our almanacs,\r\nwhich denotes the year of the lunar cycle. Thus, fourteen was the golden\r\nnumber for 1837, being the fourteenth year of the lunar cycle.\r\n\r\nThe inequalities of the moon's motions are divided into periodical and\r\nsecular. _Periodical_ inequalities are those which are completed in\r\ncomparatively short periods. _Secular_ inequalities are those which are\r\ncompleted only in very long periods, such as centuries or ages. Hence\r\nthe corresponding terms _periodical equations_ and _secular equations_.\r\nAs an example of a secular inequality, we may mention the acceleration\r\nof the _moon's mean motion_. It is discovered that the moon actually\r\nrevolves around the earth in a less period now than she did in ancient\r\ntimes. The difference, however, is exceedingly small, being only about\r\nten seconds in a century. In a lunar eclipse, the moon's longitude\r\ndiffers from that of the sun, at the middle of the eclipse, by exactly\r\none hundred and eighty degrees; and since the sun's longitude at any\r\ngiven time of the year is known, if we can learn the day and hour when\r\nan eclipse occurred at any period of the world, we of course know the\r\nlongitude of the sun and moon at that period. Now, in the year 721,\r\nbefore the Christian era, Ptolemy records a lunar eclipse to have\r\nhappened, and to have been observed by the Chaldeans. The moon's\r\nlongitude, therefore, for that time, is known; and as we know the mean\r\nmotions of the moon, at present, starting from that epoch, and\r\ncomputing, as may easily be done, the place which the moon ought to\r\noccupy at present, at any given time, she is found to be actually nearly\r\na degree and a half in advance of that place. Moreover, the same\r\nconclusion is derived from a comparison of the Chaldean observations\r\nwith those made by an Arabian astronomer of the tenth century.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon at first led astronomers to apprehend that the moon\r\nencountered a resisting medium, which, by destroying at every revolution\r\na small portion of her projectile force, would have the effect to bring\r\nher nearer and nearer to the earth, and thus to augment her velocity.\r\nBut, in 1786, La Place demonstrated that this acceleration is one of the\r\nlegitimate effects of the sun's disturbing force, and is so connected\r\nwith changes in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, that the moon\r\nwill continue to be accelerated while that eccentricity diminishes; but\r\nwhen the eccentricity has reached its minimum, or lowest point, (as it\r\nwill do, after many ages,) and begins to increase, then the moon's\r\nmotions will begin to be retarded, and thus her mean motions will\r\noscillate for ever about a mean value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nECLIPSES.\r\n\r\n           ----\"As when the sun, new risen,\r\n    Looks through the horizontal misty air,\r\n    Shorn of his beams, or from behind the moon,\r\n    In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds\r\n    On half the nations, and with fear of change\r\n    Perplexes monarchs: darkened so, yet shone,\r\n    Above them all, the Archangel.\"--_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING now learned various particulars respecting the earth, the sun,\r\nand the moon, you are prepared to understand the explanation of solar\r\nand lunar eclipses, which have in all ages excited a high degree of\r\ninterest. Indeed, what is more admirable, than that astronomers should\r\nbe able to tell us, years beforehand, the exact instant of the\r\ncommencement and termination of an eclipse, and describe all the\r\nattendant circumstances with the greatest fidelity. You have doubtless,\r\nmy dear friend, participated in this admiration, and felt a strong\r\ndesire to learn how it is that astronomers are able to look so far into\r\nfuturity. I will endeavor, in this Letter, to explain to you the leading\r\nprinciples of the calculation of eclipses, with as much plainness as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAn _eclipse of the moon_ happens when the moon, in its revolution around\r\nthe earth, falls into the earth's shadow. An _eclipse of the sun_\r\nhappens when the moon, coming between the earth and the sun, covers\r\neither a part or the whole of the solar disk.\r\n\r\nThe earth and the moon being both opaque, globular bodies, exposed to\r\nthe sun's light, they cast shadows opposite to the sun, like any other\r\nbodies on which the sun shines. Were the sun of the same size with the\r\nearth and the moon, then the lines drawn touching the surface of the sun\r\nand the surface of the earth or moon (which lines form the boundaries of\r\nthe shadow) would be parallel to each other, and the shadow would be a\r\ncylinder infinite in length; and were the sun less than the earth or\r\nthe moon, the shadow would be an increasing cone, its narrower end\r\nresting on the earth; but as the sun is vastly greater than either of\r\nthese bodies, the shadow of each is a cone whose base rests on the body\r\nitself, and which comes to a point, or vertex, at a certain distance\r\nbehind the body. These several cases are represented in the following\r\ndiagrams, Figs. 39, 40, 41.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Figs. 39, 40, 41.]\r\n\r\nIt is found, by calculation, that the length of the moon's shadow, on an\r\naverage, is just about sufficient to reach to the earth; but the moon is\r\nsometimes further from the earth than at others, and when she is nearer\r\nthan usual, the shadow reaches considerably beyond the surface of the\r\nearth. Also, the moon, as well as the earth, is at different distances\r\nfrom the sun at different times, and its shadow is longest when it is\r\nfurthest from the sun. Now, when both these circumstances conspire, that\r\nis, when the moon is in her perigee and along with the earth in her\r\naphelion, her shadow extends nearly fifteen thousand miles beyond the\r\ncentre of the earth, and covers a space on the surface one hundred and\r\nseventy miles broad. The earth's shadow is nearly a million of miles in\r\nlength, and consequently more than three and a half times as long as the\r\ndistance of the earth from the moon; and it is also, at the distance of\r\nthe moon, three times as broad as the moon itself.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the sun can take place only at new moon, when the sun and\r\nmoon meet in the same part of the heavens, for then only can the moon\r\ncome between us and the sun; and an eclipse of the moon can occur only\r\nwhen the sun and moon are in opposite parts of the heavens, or at full\r\nmoon; for then only can the moon fall into the shadow of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of eclipses will be clearly understood from the following\r\nrepresentation. The diagram, Fig. 42, exhibits the relative position of\r\nthe sun, the earth, and the moon, both in a solar and in a lunar\r\neclipse. Here, the moon is first represented, while revolving round the\r\nearth, as passing between the earth and the sun, and casting its shadow\r\non the earth. As the moon is here supposed to be at her average distance\r\nfrom the earth, the shadow but just reaches the earth's surface. Were\r\nthe moon (as is sometimes the case) nearer the earth her shadow would\r\nnot terminate in a point, as is represented in the figure, but at a\r\ngreater or less distance nearer the base of the cone, so as to cover a\r\nconsiderable space, which, as I have already mentioned, sometimes\r\nextends to one hundred and seventy miles in breadth, but is commonly\r\nmuch less than this. On the other side of the earth, the moon is\r\nrepresented as traversing the earth's shadow, as is the case in a lunar\r\neclipse. As the moon is sometimes nearer the earth and sometimes further\r\noff, it is evident that it will traverse the shadow at a broader or a\r\nnarrower part, accordingly. The figure, however, represents the moon as\r\npassing the shadow further from the earth than is ever actually the\r\ncase, since the distance from the earth is never so much as one third of\r\nthe whole length of the shadow.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the figure, that if a spectator were situated where\r\nthe moon's shadow strikes the earth, the moon would cut off from him the\r\nview of the sun, or the sun would be totally eclipsed. Or, if he were\r\nwithin a certain distance of the shadow on either side, the moon would\r\nbe partly between him and the sun, and would intercept from him more or\r\nless of the sun's light, according as he was nearer to the shadow or\r\nfurther from it. If he were at _c_ or _d_, he would just see the moon\r\nentering upon the sun's disk; if he were nearer the shadow than either\r\nof these points, he would have a portion of this light cut off from his\r\nview, and more, in proportion as he drew nearer the shadow; and the\r\nmoment he entered the shadow, he would lose sight of the sun. To all\r\nplaces between _a_ or _b_ and the shadow, the sun would cast a partial\r\nshadow of the moon, growing deeper and deeper, as it approached the true\r\nshadow. This partial shadow is called the moon's _penumbra_. In like\r\nmanner, as the moon approaches the earth's shadow, in a lunar eclipse,\r\nas soon as she arrives at _a_, the earth begins to intercept from her a\r\nportion of the sun's light, or she falls in the earth's penumbra. She\r\ncontinues to lose more and more of the sun's light, as she draws near to\r\nthe shadow, and hence her disk becomes gradually obscured, until it\r\nenters the shadow, when the sun's light is entirely lost.\r\n\r\nAs the sun and earth are both situated in the plane of the ecliptic, if\r\nthe moon also revolved around the earth in this plane, we should have a\r\nsolar eclipse at every new moon, and a lunar eclipse at every full moon;\r\nfor, in the former case, the moon would come directly between us and\r\nthe sun, and in the latter case, the earth would come directly between\r\nthe sun and the moon. But the moon is inclined to the ecliptic about\r\nfive degrees, and the centre of the moon may be all this distance from\r\nthe centre of the sun at new moon, and the same distance from the centre\r\nof the earth's shadow at full moon. It is true, the moon extends across\r\nher path, one half her breadth lying on each side of it, and the sun\r\nlikewise reaches from the ecliptic a distance equal to half his breadth.\r\nBut these luminaries together make but little more than a degree, and\r\nconsequently, their two semidiameters would occupy only about half a\r\ndegree of the five degrees from one orbit to the other where they are\r\nfurthest apart. Also, the earth's shadow, where the moon crosses it,\r\nextends from the ecliptic less than three fourths of a degree, so that\r\nthe semidiameter of the moon and of the earth's shadow would together\r\nreach but little way across the space that may, in certain cases,\r\nseparate the two luminaries from each other when they are in opposition.\r\nThus, suppose we could take hold of the circle in the figure that\r\nrepresents the moon's orbit, (Fig. 42, page 197,) and lift the moon up\r\nfive degrees above the plane of the paper, it is evident that the moon,\r\nas seen from the earth, would appear in the heavens five degrees above\r\nthe sun, and of course would cut off none of his light; and it is also\r\nplain that the moon, at the full, would pass the shadow of the earth\r\nfive degrees below it, and would suffer no eclipse. But in the course of\r\nthe sun's apparent revolution round the earth once a year he is\r\nsuccessively in every part of the ecliptic; consequently, the\r\nconjunctions and oppositions of the sun and moon may occur at any part\r\nof the ecliptic, and of course at the two points where the moon's orbit\r\ncrosses the ecliptic,--that is, at the nodes; for the sun must\r\nnecessarily come to each of these nodes once a year. If, then, the moon\r\novertakes the sun just as she is crossing his path, she will hide more\r\nor less of his disk from us. Since, also, the earth's shadow is always\r\ndirectly opposite to the sun, if the sun is at one of the nodes, the\r\nshadow must extend in the direction of the other node, so as to lie\r\ndirectly across the moon's path; and if the moon overtakes it there, she\r\nwill pass through it, and be eclipsed. Thus, in Fig. 43, let BN\r\nrepresent the sun's path, and AN, the moon's,--N being the place of the\r\nnode; then it is evident, that if the two luminaries at new moon be so\r\nfar from the node, that the distances between their centres is greater\r\nthan their semidiameters, no eclipse can happen; but if that distance is\r\nless than this sum, as at E, F, then an eclipse will take place; but if\r\nthe position be as at C, D, the two bodies will just touch one another.\r\nIf A denotes the earth's shadow, instead of the sun, the same\r\nillustration will apply to an eclipse of the moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\nSince bodies are defined to be in conjunction when they are in the\r\n_same_ part of the heavens, and to be in opposition when they are in\r\n_opposite_ parts of the heavens, it may not appear how the sun and moon\r\ncan be in conjunction, as at A and B, when they are still at some\r\ndistance from each other. But it must be recollected that bodies are in\r\nconjunction when they have the same longitude, in which case they are\r\nsituated in the same great circle perpendicular to the ecliptic,--that\r\nis, in the same secondary to the ecliptic. One of these bodies may be\r\nmuch further from the ecliptic than the other; still, if the same\r\nsecondary to the ecliptic passes through them both, they will be in\r\nconjunction or opposition.\r\n\r\nIn a total eclipse of the moon, its disk is still visible, shining with\r\na dull, red light. This light cannot be derived directly from the sun,\r\nsince the view of the sun is completely hidden from the moon; nor by\r\nreflection from the earth, since the illuminated side of the earth is\r\nwholly turned from the moon; but it is owing to refraction from the\r\nearth's atmosphere, by which a few scattered rays of the sun are bent\r\nround into the earth's shadow and conveyed to the moon, sufficient in\r\nnumber to afford the feeble light in question.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible fully to understand the _method of calculating\r\neclipses_, without a knowledge of trigonometry; still it is not\r\ndifficult to form some general notion of the process. It may be readily\r\nconceived that, by long-continued observations on the sun and moon, the\r\nlaws of their revolution may be so well understood, that the exact\r\nplaces which they will occupy in the heavens at any future times may be\r\nforeseen and laid down in tables of the sun and moon's motions; that we\r\nmay thus ascertain, by inspecting the tables, the instant when these two\r\nbodies will be together in the heavens, or be in conjunction, and when\r\nthey will be one hundred and eighty degrees apart, or in opposition.\r\nMoreover, since the exact place of the moon's node among the stars at\r\nany particular time is known to astronomers, it cannot be difficult to\r\ndetermine when the new or full moon occurs in the same part of the\r\nheavens as that where the node is projected, as seen from the earth. In\r\nshort, as astronomers can easily determine what will be the relative\r\nposition of the sun, the moon, and the moon's nodes, for any given time,\r\nthey can tell when these luminaries will meet so near the node as to\r\nproduce an eclipse of the sun, or when they will be in opposition so\r\nnear the node as to produce an eclipse of the moon.\r\n\r\nA little reflection will enable you to form a clear idea of the\r\nsituation of the sun, the moon, and the earth, at the time of a solar\r\neclipse. First, suppose the conjunction to take place at the node; that\r\nis, imagine the moon to come _directly_ between the earth and the sun,\r\nas she will of course do, if she comes between the earth and the sun the\r\nmoment she is crossing the ecliptic; for then the three bodies will all\r\nlie in one and the same straight line. But when the moon is in the\r\necliptic, her shadow, or at least the axis, or central line, of the\r\nshadow, must coincide with the line that joins the centres of the sun\r\nand earth, and reach along the plane of the ecliptic towards the earth.\r\nThe moon's shadow, at her average distance from the earth, is just about\r\nlong enough to reach the surface of the earth; but when the moon, at the\r\nnew, is in her apogee, or at her greatest distance from the earth, the\r\nshadow is not long enough to reach the earth. On the contrary, when the\r\nmoon is nearer to us than her average distance, her shadow is long\r\nenough to reach beyond the earth, extending, when the moon is in her\r\nperigee, more than fourteen thousand miles beyond the centre of the\r\nearth. Now, as during the eclipse the moon moves nearly in the plane of\r\nthe ecliptic, her shadow which accompanies her must also move nearly in\r\nthe same plane, and must therefore traverse the earth across its central\r\nregions, along the terrestrial ecliptic, since this is nothing more than\r\nthe intersection of the plane of the celestial ecliptic with the earth's\r\nsurface. The motion of the earth, too, on its axis, in the same\r\ndirection, will carry a place along with the shadow, though with a less\r\nvelocity by more than one half; so that the actual velocity of the\r\nshadow, in respect to places over which it passes on the earth, will\r\nonly equal the difference between its own rate and that of the places,\r\nas they are carried forward in the diurnal revolution.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far supposed that the moon comes to her conjunction\r\nprecisely at the node, or at the moment when she is crossing the\r\necliptic. But, secondly, suppose she is on the north side of the\r\necliptic at the time of conjunction, and moving towards her descending\r\nnode, and that the conjunction takes place as far from the node as an\r\neclipse can happen. The shadow will not fall in the plane of the\r\necliptic, but a little northward of it, so as just to graze the earth\r\nnear the pole of the ecliptic. The nearer the conjunction comes to the\r\nnode, the further the shadow will fall from the polar towards the\r\nequatorial regions.\r\n\r\nIn a solar eclipse, the shadow of the moon travels over a portion of the\r\nearth, as the shadow of a small cloud, seen from an eminence in a clear\r\nday, rides along over hills and plains. Let us imagine ourselves\r\nstanding on the moon; then we shall see the earth partially eclipsed by\r\nthe moon's shadow, in the same manner as we now see the moon eclipsed by\r\nthe shadow of the earth; and we might calculate the various\r\ncircumstances of the eclipse,--its commencement, duration, and\r\nquantity,--in the same manner as we calculate these elements in an\r\neclipse of the moon, as seen from the earth. But although the general\r\ncharacters of a solar eclipse might be investigated on these principles,\r\nso far as respects the earth at large, yet, as the appearances of the\r\nsame eclipse of the sun are very different at different places on the\r\nearth's surface, it is necessary to calculate its peculiar aspects for\r\neach place separately, a circumstance which makes the calculation of a\r\nsolar eclipse much more complicated and tedious than that of an eclipse\r\nof the moon. The moon, when she enters the shadow of the earth, is\r\ndeprived of the light of the part immersed, and the effect upon its\r\nappearance is the same as though that part were painted black, in which\r\ncase it would be black alike to all places where the moon was above the\r\nhorizon. But it not so with a solar eclipse. We do not see this by the\r\nshadow cast on the earth, as we should do, if we stood on the moon, but\r\nby the interposition of the moon between us and the sun; and the sun may\r\nbe hidden from one observer, while he is in full view of another only a\r\nfew miles distant. Thus, a small insulated cloud sailing in a clear sky\r\nwill, for a few moments, hide the sun from us, and from a certain space\r\nnear us, while all the region around is illuminated. But although the\r\nanalogy between the motions of the shadow of a small cloud and of the\r\nmoon in a solar eclipse holds good in many particulars, yet the velocity\r\nof the lunar shadow is far greater than that of the cloud, being no less\r\nthan two thousand two hundred and eighty miles per hour.\r\n\r\nThe moon's shadow can never cover a space on the earth more than one\r\nhundred and seventy miles broad, and the space actually covered commonly\r\nfalls much short of that. The portion of the earth's surface ever\r\ncovered by the moon's penumbra is about four thousand three hundred and\r\nninety-three miles.\r\n\r\nThe apparent diameter of the moon varies materially at different times,\r\nbeing greatest when the moon is nearest to us, and least when she is\r\nfurthest off; while the sun's apparent dimensions remain nearly the\r\nsame. When the moon is at her average distance from the earth, she is\r\njust about large enough to cover the sun's disk; consequently, if, in a\r\ncentral eclipse of the sun, the moon is at her mean distance, she covers\r\nthe sun but for an instant, producing only a momentary eclipse. If she\r\nis nearer than her average distance, then the eclipse may continue total\r\nsome time, though never more than eight minutes, and seldom so long as\r\nthat; but if she is further off than usual, or towards her apogee, then\r\nshe is not large enough to cover the whole solar disk, but we see a ring\r\nof the sun encircling the moon, constituting an _annular eclipse_, as\r\nseen in Fig. 44. Even the elevation of the moon above the horizon will\r\nsometimes sensibly affect the dimensions of the eclipse. You will\r\nrecollect that the moon is nearer to us when on the meridian than when\r\nin the horizon by nearly four thousand miles, or by nearly the radius of\r\nthe earth; and consequently, her apparent diameter is largest when on\r\nthe meridian. The difference is so considerable, that the same eclipse\r\nwill appear total to a spectator who views it near his meridian, while,\r\nat the same moment, it appears annular to one who has the moon near his\r\nhorizon. An annular eclipse may last, at most, twelve minutes and\r\ntwenty-four seconds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\nEclipses of the sun are more frequent than those of the moon. Yet lunar\r\neclipses being visible to every part of the terrestrial hemisphere\r\nopposite to the sun, while those of the sun are visible only to a small\r\nportion of the hemisphere on which the moon's shadow falls, it happens\r\nthat, for any particular place on the earth, lunar eclipses are more\r\nfrequently visible than solar. In any year, the number of eclipses of\r\nboth luminaries cannot be less than two nor more than seven: the most\r\nusual number is four, and it is very rare to have more than six. A total\r\neclipse of the moon frequently happens at the next full moon after an\r\neclipse of the sun. For since, in a solar eclipse, the sun is at or near\r\none of the moon's nodes,--that is, is projected to the place in the sky\r\nwhere the moon crosses the ecliptic,--the earth's shadow, which is of\r\ncourse directly opposite to the sun, must be at or near the other node,\r\nand may not have passed too far from the node before the moon comes\r\nround to the opposition and overtakes it. In total eclipses of the sun,\r\nthere has sometimes been observed a remarkable radiation of light from\r\nthe margin of the sun, which is thought to be owing to the zodiacal\r\nlight, which is of such dimensions as to extend far beyond the solar\r\norb. A striking appearance of this kind was exhibited in the total\r\neclipse of the sun which occurred in June, 1806.\r\n\r\nA total eclipse of the sun is one of the most sublime and impressive\r\nphenomena of Nature. Among barbarous tribes it is ever contemplated with\r\nfear and astonishment, and as strongly indicative of the displeasure of\r\nthe gods. Two ancient nations, the Lydians and Medes, alluded to before,\r\nwho were engaged in a bloody war, about six hundred years before Christ,\r\nwere smitten with such awe, on the appearance of a total eclipse of the\r\nsun, just on the eve of a battle, that they threw down their arms, and\r\nmade peace. When Columbus first discovered America, and was in danger of\r\nhostility from the Natives, he awed them into submission by telling them\r\nthat the sun would be darkened on a certain day, in token of the anger\r\nof the gods at them, for their treatment of him.\r\n\r\nAmong cultivated nations, a total eclipse of the sun is recognised, from\r\nthe exactness with which the time of occurrence and the various\r\nappearances answer to the prediction, as affording one of the proudest\r\ntriumphs of astronomy. By astronomers themselves, it is of course viewed\r\nwith the highest interest, not only as verifying their calculations, but\r\nas contributing to establish, beyond all doubt, the certainty of those\r\ngrand laws, the truth of which is involved in the result. I had the good\r\nfortune to witness the total eclipse of the sun of June, 1806, which was\r\none of the most remarkable on record. To the wondering gaze of childhood\r\nit presented a spectacle that can never be forgotten. A bright and\r\nbeautiful morning inspired universal joy, for the sky was entirely\r\ncloudless. Every one was busily occupied in preparing smoked glass, in\r\nreadiness for the great sight, which was to be first seen about ten\r\no'clock. A thrill of mingled wonder and delight struck every mind when,\r\nat the appointed moment, a little black indentation appeared on the limb\r\nof the sun. This gradually expanded, covering more and more of the solar\r\ndisk, until an increasing gloom was spread over the face of Nature; and\r\nwhen the sun was wholly lost, near mid-day, a feeling of horror pervaded\r\nalmost every beholder. The darkness was wholly unlike that of twilight\r\nor night. A thick curtain, very different from clouds, hung upon the\r\nface of the sky, producing a strange and indescribably gloomy\r\nappearance, which was reflected from all things on the earth, in hues\r\nequally strange and unnatural. Some of the planets, and the largest of\r\nthe fixed stars, shone out through the gloom, yet with their usual\r\nbrightness. The temperature of the air rapidly declined, and so sudden a\r\nchill came over the earth, that many persons caught severe colds from\r\ntheir exposure. Even the animal tribes exhibited tokens of fear and\r\nagitation. Birds, especially, fluttered and flew swiftly about, and\r\ndomestic fowls went to rest.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the word _eclipse_ is derived from a Greek word, (= ekleipsis=,\r\n_ekleipsis_,) which signifies to fail, to faint or swoon away; since the\r\nmoon, at the period of her greatest brightness, falling into the shadow\r\nof the earth, was imagined by the ancients to sicken and swoon, as if\r\nshe were going to die. By some very ancient nations she was supposed, at\r\nsuch times, to be in pain; and, in order to relieve her fancied\r\ndistress, they lifted torches high in the atmosphere, blew horns and\r\ntrumpets, beat upon brazen vessels, and even, after the eclipse was\r\nover, they offered sacrifices to the moon. The opinion also extensively\r\nprevailed, that it was in the power of witches, by their spells and\r\ncharms, not only to darken the moon, but to bring her down from her\r\norbit, and to compel her to shed her baleful influences upon the earth.\r\nIn solar eclipses, also, especially when total, the sun was supposed to\r\nturn away his face in abhorrence of some atrocious crime, that either\r\nhad been perpetrated or was about to be perpetrated, and to threaten\r\nmankind with everlasting night, and the destruction of the world. To\r\nsuch superstitions Milton alludes, in the passage which I have taken for\r\nthe motto of this Letter.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, who, from a very high period of antiquity, have been great\r\nobservers of eclipses, although they did not take much notice of those\r\nof the moon, regarded eclipses of the sun in general as unfortunate, but\r\nespecially such as occurred on the first day of the year. These were\r\nthought to forebode the greatest calamities to the emperor, who on such\r\noccasions did not receive the usual compliments of the season. When,\r\nfrom the predictions of their astronomers, an eclipse of the sun was\r\nexpected, they made great preparation at court for observing it; and as\r\nsoon as it commenced, a blind man beat a drum, a great concourse\r\nassembled, and the mandarins, or nobility, appeared in state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XIX.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDE.--TIDES.\r\n\r\n    \"First in his east, the glorious lamp was seen,\r\n    Regent of day, and all the horizon round\r\n    Invested with bright rays, jocund to run\r\n    His _longitude_ through heaven's high road; the gray\r\n    Dawn and the Pleiades before him danced,\r\n    Shedding sweet influence.\"--_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ancients studied astronomy chiefly as subsidiary to astrology, with\r\nthe vain hope of thus penetrating the veil of futurity, and reading\r\ntheir destinies among the stars. The moderns, on the other hand, have in\r\nview, as the great practical object of this study, the perfecting of the\r\nart of navigation. When we reflect on the vast interests embarked on the\r\nocean, both of property and life, and upon the immense benefits that\r\naccrue to society from a safe and speedy intercourse between the\r\ndifferent nations of the earth, we cannot but see that whatever tends to\r\nenable the mariner to find his way on the pathless ocean, and to secure\r\nhim against its multiplied dangers, must confer a signal benefit on\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, to venture out of sight of land was deemed an act of\r\nextreme audacity; and Horace, the Roman poet, pronounces him who first\r\nventured to trust his frail bark to the stormy ocean, endued with a\r\nheart of oak, and girt with triple folds of brass. But now, the\r\nnavigator who fully avails himself of all the resources of science, and\r\nespecially of astronomy, may launch fearlessly on the deep, and almost\r\nbid defiance to rocks and tempests. By enabling the navigator to find\r\nhis place on the ocean with almost absolute precision, however he may\r\nhave been driven about by the winds, and however long he may have been\r\nout of sight of land, astronomers must be held as great benefactors to\r\nall who commit either their lives or their fortunes to the sea. Nor\r\nhave they secured to the art of navigation such benefits without\r\nincredible study and toil, in watching the motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies, in investigating the laws by which their movements are governed,\r\nand in reducing all their discoveries to a form easily available to the\r\nnavigator, so that, by some simple observation on one or two of the\r\nheavenly bodies, with instruments which the astronomer has invented, and\r\nprepared for his use, and by looking out a few numbers in tables which\r\nhave been compiled for him, with immense labor, he may ascertain the\r\nexact place he occupies on the surface of the globe, thousands of miles\r\nfrom land.\r\n\r\nThe situation of any place is known by its latitude and longitude. As\r\ncharts of every ocean and sea are furnished to the sailor, in which are\r\nlaid down the latitudes and longitudes of every point of land, whether\r\non the shores of islands or the main, he has, therefore, only to\r\nascertain his latitude and longitude at any particular place on the\r\nocean, in order to find where he is, with respect to the nearest point\r\nof land, although this may be, and may always have been, entirely out of\r\nsight to him.\r\n\r\nTo determine the _latitude_ of a place is comparatively an easy matter,\r\nwhenever we can see either the sun or the stars. The distance of the sun\r\nfrom the zenith, when on the meridian, on a given day of the year,\r\n(which distance we may easily take with the sextant,) enables us, with\r\nthe aid of the tables, to find the latitude of the place; or, by taking\r\nthe altitude of the north star, we at once obtain the latitude.\r\n\r\nThe _longitude_ of a place may be found by any method, by which we may\r\nascertain how much its time of day differs from that of Greenwich at the\r\nsame moment. A place that lies eastward of another comes to the meridian\r\nan hour earlier for every fifteen degrees of longitude, and of course\r\nhas the hour of the day so much in advance of the other, so that it\r\ncounts one o'clock when the other place counts twelve. On the other\r\nhand, a place lying westward of another comes to the meridian later by\r\none hour for every fifteen degrees, so that it counts only eleven\r\no'clock when the other place counts twelve. Keeping these principles in\r\nview, it is easy to see that a comparison of the difference of time\r\nbetween two places at the same moment, allowing fifteen degrees for an\r\nhour, sixty minutes for every four minutes of time, and sixty seconds\r\nfor every four seconds of time, affords us an accurate mode of finding\r\nthe difference of longitude between the two places. This comparison may\r\nbe made by means of a chronometer, or from solar or lunar eclipses, or\r\nby what is called the lunar method of finding the longitude.\r\n\r\n_Chronometers_ are distinguished from clocks, by being regulated by\r\nmeans of a balance-wheel instead of a pendulum. A watch, therefore,\r\ncomes under the general definition of a chronometer; but the name is\r\nmore commonly applied to larger timepieces, too large to be carried\r\nabout the person, and constructed with the greatest possible accuracy,\r\nwith special reference to finding the longitude. Suppose, then, we are\r\nfurnished with a chronometer set to Greenwich time. We arrive at New\r\nYork, for example, and compare it with the time there. We find it is\r\nfive hours in advance of the New-York time, indicating five o'clock,\r\nP.M., when it is noon at New York. Hence we find that the longitude of\r\nNew York is 5×15=75 degrees.[11] The time at New York, or any individual\r\nplace, can be known by observations with the transit-instrument, which\r\ngives us the precise moment when the sun is on the meridian.\r\n\r\nIt would not be necessary to resort to Greenwich, for the purpose of\r\nsetting our chronometer to Greenwich time, as it might be set at any\r\nplace whose longitude is known, having been previously determined. Thus,\r\nif we know that the longitude of a certain place is exactly sixty\r\ndegrees east of Greenwich, we have only to set our chronometer four\r\nhours behind the time at that place, and it will be regulated to\r\nGreenwich time. Hence it is a matter of the greatest importance to\r\nnavigation, that the longitude of numerous ports, in different parts of\r\nthe earth, should be accurately determined, so that when a ship arrives\r\nat any such port, it may have the means of setting or verifying its\r\nchronometer.\r\n\r\nThis method of taking the longitude seems so easy, that you will perhaps\r\nask, why it is not sufficient for all purposes, and accordingly, why it\r\ndoes not supersede the move complicated and laborious methods? why every\r\nsailor does not provide himself with a chronometer, instead of finding\r\nhis longitude at sea by tedious and oft-repeated calculations, as he is\r\nin the habit of doing? I answer, it is only in a few extraordinary cases\r\nthat chronometers have been constructed of such accuracy as to afford\r\nresults as exact as those obtained by the other methods, to be described\r\nshortly; and instruments of such perfection are too expensive for\r\ngeneral use among sailors. Indeed, the more common chronometers cost too\r\nmuch to come within the means of a great majority of sea-faring men.\r\nMoreover, by being transported from place to place, chronometers are\r\nliable to change their _rate_. By the rate of any timepiece is meant its\r\ndeviation from perfect accuracy. Thus, if a clock should gain one second\r\nper day, one day with another, and we should find it impossible to bring\r\nit nearer to the truth, we may reckon this as its rate, and allow for it\r\nin our estimate of the time of any particular observation. If the error\r\nwas not uniform, but sometimes greater and sometimes less than one\r\nsecond per day, then the amount of such deviation is called its\r\n\"variation from its mean rate.\" I introduce these minute statements,\r\n(which are more precise than I usually deem necessary,) to show you to\r\nwhat an astonishing degree of accuracy chronometers have in some\r\ninstances been brought. They have been carried from London to Baffin's\r\nBay, and brought back, after a three years' voyage, and found to have\r\nvaried from their mean rate, during the whole time, only a second or\r\ntwo, while the extreme variation of several chronometers, tried at the\r\nRoyal Observatory at Greenwich, never exceeded a second and a half.\r\nCould chronometers always be depended on to such a degree of accuracy as\r\nthis, we should hardly desire any thing better for determining the\r\nlongitude of different places on the earth. A recent determination of\r\nthe longitude of the City Hall in New York, by means of three\r\nchronometers, sent out from London expressly for that purpose, did not\r\ndiffer from the longitude as found by a solar eclipse (which is one of\r\nthe best methods) but a second and a quarter.\r\n\r\n_Eclipses of the sun and moon_ furnish the means of ascertaining the\r\nlongitude of a place, because the entrance of the moon into the earth's\r\nshadow in a lunar eclipse, and the entrance of the moon upon the disk of\r\nthe sun in a solar eclipse, are severally examples of one of those\r\ninstantaneous occurrences in the heavens, which afford the means of\r\ncomparing the times of different places, and of thus determining their\r\ndifferences of longitude. Thus, if the commencement of a lunar eclipse\r\nwas seen at one place an hour sooner than at another, the two places\r\nwould be fifteen degrees apart, in longitude; and if the longitude of\r\none of the places was known, that of the other would become known also.\r\nThe exact instant of the moon's entering into the shadow of the earth,\r\nhowever, cannot be determined with very great precision, since the moon,\r\nin passing through the earth's penumbra, loses its light gradually, so\r\nthat the moment when it leaves the penumbra and enters into the shadow\r\ncannot be very accurately defined. The first contact of the moon with\r\nthe sun's disk, in a solar eclipse, or the moment of leaving it,--that\r\nis, the beginning and end of the eclipse,--are instants that can be\r\ndetermined with much precision, and accordingly they are much relied on\r\nfor an accurate determination of the longitude. But, on account of the\r\ncomplicated and laborious nature of the calculation of the longitude\r\nfrom an eclipse of the sun, (since the beginning and end are not seen at\r\ndifferent places, at the same moment,) this method of finding the\r\nlongitude is not adapted to common use, nor available at sea. It is\r\nuseful, however, for determining the longitude of fixed observatories.\r\nThe _lunar method of finding the longitude_ is the most refined and\r\naccurate of all the modes practised at sea. The motion of the moon\r\nthrough the heavens is so rapid, that she perceptibly alters her\r\ndistance from any star every minute; consequently, the moment when that\r\ndistance is a certain number of degrees and minutes is one of those\r\ninstantaneous events, which may be taken advantage of for comparing the\r\ntimes of different places, and thus determining their difference of\r\nlongitude. Now, in a work called the 'Nautical Almanac,' printed in\r\nLondon, annually, for the use of navigators, the distance of the moon\r\nfrom the sun by day, or from known fixed stars by night, for every day\r\nand night in the year, is calculated beforehand. If, therefore, a sailor\r\nwishes to ascertain his longitude, he may take with his sextant the\r\ndistance of the moon from one of these stars at any time,--suppose nine\r\no'clock, at night,--and then turn to the 'Nautical Almanac,' and see\r\n_what time it was at Greenwich_ when the distance between the moon and\r\nthat star was the same. Let it be twelve o'clock, or three hours in\r\nadvance of his time: his longitude, of course, is forty-five degrees\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThis method requires more skill and accuracy than are possessed by the\r\nmajority of seafaring men; but, when practised with the requisite degree\r\nof skill, its results are very satisfactory. Captain Basil Hall, one of\r\nthe most scientific commanders in the British navy, relates the\r\nfollowing incident, to show the excellence of this method. He sailed\r\nfrom San Blas, on the west coast of Mexico, and, after a voyage of eight\r\nthousand miles, occupying eighty-nine days, arrived off Rio de Janeiro,\r\nhaving, in this interval, passed through the Pacific Ocean, rounded Cape\r\nHorn, and crossed the South Atlantic, without making any land, or even\r\nseeing a single sail, with the exception of an American whaler off Cape\r\nHorn. When within a week's sail of Rio, he set seriously about\r\ndetermining, by lunar observations, the precise line of the ship's\r\ncourse, and its situation at a determinate moment; and having\r\nascertained this within from five to ten miles, ran the rest of the way\r\nby those more ready and compendious methods, known to navigators, which\r\ncan be safely employed for short trips between one known point and\r\nanother, but which cannot be trusted in long voyages, where the moon is\r\nthe only sure guide. They steered towards Rio Janeiro for some days\r\nafter taking the lunars, and, having arrived within fifteen or twenty\r\nmiles of the coast, they hove to, at four in the morning, till the day\r\nshould break, and then bore up, proceeding cautiously, on account of a\r\nthick fog which enveloped them. As this cleared away, they had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the great Sugar-Loaf Rock, which stands on one\r\nside of the harbor's mouth, so nearly right ahead, that they had not to\r\nalter their course above a point, in order to hit the entrance of the\r\nharbor. This was the first land they had seen for three months, after\r\ncrossing so many seas, and being set backwards and forwards by\r\ninnumerable currents and foul winds. The effect on all on board was\r\nelectric; and the admiration of the sailors was unbounded. Indeed, what\r\ncould be more admirable than that a man on the deck of a vessel, by\r\nmeasuring the distance between the moon and a star, with a little\r\ninstrument which he held in his hand, could determine his exact place on\r\nthe earth's surface in the midst of a vast ocean, after having traversed\r\nit in all directions, for three months, crossing his track many times,\r\nand all the while out of sight of land?\r\n\r\nThe lunar method of finding the longitude could never have been\r\nsusceptible of sufficient accuracy, had not the motions of the moon,\r\nwith all their irregularities, been studied and investigated by the most\r\nlaborious and profound researches. Hence Newton, while wrapt in those\r\nmeditations which, to superficial minds, would perhaps have appeared\r\nrather curious than useful, inasmuch as they respected distant bodies of\r\nthe universe which seemed to have little connexion with the affairs of\r\nthis world, was laboring night and day for the benefit of the sailor and\r\nthe merchant. He was guiding the vessel of the one, and securing the\r\nmerchandise of the other; and thus he contributed a large share to\r\npromote the happiness of his fellow-men, not only in exalting the powers\r\nof the human intellect, but also in preserving the lives and fortunes of\r\nthose engaged in navigation and commerce. Principles in science are\r\nrules in art; and the philosopher who is engaged in the investigation of\r\nthese principles, although his pursuits may be thought less practically\r\nuseful than those of the artisan who carries out those principles into\r\nreal life, yet, without the knowledge of the principles, the rules would\r\nhave never been known. Studies, therefore, the most abstruse, are, when\r\nviewed as furnishing rules to act, often productive of the highest\r\npractical utility.\r\n\r\nSince the _tides_ are occasioned by the influence of the sun and moon, I\r\nwill conclude this Letter with a few remarks on this curious phenomenon.\r\nBy the tides are meant the alternate rising and falling of the waters of\r\nthe ocean. Its greatest and least elevations are called _high and low\r\nwater_; its rising and falling are called _flood and ebb_; and the\r\nextraordinary high and low tides that occur twice every month are called\r\n_spring and neap tides_. It is high or low tide on opposite sides of the\r\nglobe at the same time. If, for example, we have high water at noon, it\r\nis also high water to those who live on the meridian below us, where it\r\nis midnight. In like manner, low water occurs simultaneously on opposite\r\nsides of the meridian. The average amount of the tides for the whole\r\nglobe is about two and a half feet; but their actual height at different\r\nplaces is very various, sometimes being scarcely perceptible, and\r\nsometimes rising to sixty or seventy feet. At the same place, also, the\r\nphenomena of the tides are very different at different times. In the Bay\r\nof Fundy, where the tide rises seventy feet, it comes in a mighty wave,\r\nseen thirty miles off, and roaring with a loud noise. At the mouth of\r\nthe Severn, in England, the flood comes up in one head about ten feet\r\nhigh, bringing certain destruction to any small craft that has been\r\nunfortunately left by the ebbing waters on the flats and as it passes\r\nthe mouth of the Avon, it sends up that small river a vast body of\r\nwater, rising, at Bristol, forty or fifty feet.\r\n\r\nTides are caused by the unequal attractions of the sun and moon upon\r\ndifferent parts of the earth. Suppose the projectile force by which the\r\nearth is carried forward in her orbit to be suspended, and the earth to\r\nfall towards one of these bodies,--the moon, for example,--in\r\nconsequence of their mutual attraction. Then, if all parts of the earth\r\nfell equally towards the moon, no derangement of its different parts\r\nwould result, any more than of the particles of a drop of water, in its\r\ndescent to the ground. But if one part fell faster than another, the\r\ndifferent portions would evidently be separated from each other. Now,\r\nthis is precisely what takes place with respect to the earth, in its\r\nfall towards the moon. The portions of the earth in the hemisphere next\r\nto the moon, on account of being nearer to the centre of attraction,\r\nfall faster than those in the opposite hemisphere, and consequently\r\nleave them behind. The solid earth, on account of its cohesion, cannot\r\nobey this impulse, since all its different portions constitute one mass,\r\nwhich is acted on in the same manner as though it were all collected in\r\nthe centre; but the waters on the surface, moving freely under this\r\nimpulse, endeavor to desert the solid mass and fall towards the moon.\r\nFor a similar reason, the waters in the opposite hemisphere, falling\r\nless towards the moon than the solid earth does, are left behind, or\r\nappear to rise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\nBut if the moon draws the waters of the earth into an oval form towards\r\nherself, raising them simultaneously on the opposite sides of the earth,\r\nthey must obviously be drawn away from the intermediate parts of the\r\nearth, where it must at the same time be low water. Thus, in Fig. 46,\r\nthe moon, M, raises the waters beneath itself at Z and N, at which\r\nplaces it is high water, but at the same time depresses the waters at H\r\nand R, at which places it is low water. Hence, the interval between the\r\nhigh and low tide, on successive days, is about fifty minutes,\r\ncorresponding to the progress of the moon in her orbit from west to\r\neast, which causes her to come to the meridian about fifty minutes later\r\nevery day. There occurs, however, an intermediate tide, when the moon is\r\non the lower meridian, so that the interval between two high tides is\r\nabout twelve hours, and twenty-five minutes.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the impediments which prevent the force from producing\r\nits full effects, we might expect to see the great tide-wave, as the\r\nelevated crest is called, always directly beneath the moon, attending it\r\nregularly around the globe. But the inertia of the waters prevents their\r\ninstantly obeying the moon's attraction, and the friction of the waters\r\non the bottom of the ocean still further retards its progress. It is\r\nnot, therefore, until several hours (differing at different places)\r\nafter the moon has passed the meridian of a place, that it is high tide\r\nat that place.\r\n\r\nThe _sun_ has an action similar to that of the moon, but only _one\r\nthird_ as great. On account of the great mass of the sun, compared with\r\nthat of the moon, we might suppose that his action in raising the tides\r\nwould be greater than the moon's; but the nearness of the moon to the\r\nearth more than compensates for the sun's greater quantity of matter.\r\nAs, however, wrong views are frequently entertained on this subject, let\r\nus endeavor to form a correct idea of the advantage which the moon\r\nderives from her proximity. It is not that her actual amount of\r\nattraction is thus rendered greater than that of the sun; but it is that\r\nher attraction for the _different parts_ of the earth is very unequal,\r\nwhile that of the sun is nearly uniform. It is the _inequality_ of this\r\naction, and not the absolute force, that produces the tides. The sun\r\nbeing ninety-five millions of miles from the earth, while the diameter\r\nof the earth is only one twelve thousandth part of this distance, the\r\neffects of the sun's attraction will be nearly the same on all parts of\r\nthe earth, and therefore will not, as was explained of the moon, tend to\r\nseparate the waters from the earth on the nearest side, or the earth\r\nfrom the waters on the remotest side, but in a degree proportionally\r\nsmaller. But the diameter of the earth is one thirtieth the distance of\r\nthe moon, and therefore the moon acts with considerably greater power on\r\none part of the earth than on another.\r\n\r\nAs the sun and moon both contribute to produce the tides, and as they\r\nsometimes act together and sometimes in opposition to each other, so\r\ncorresponding variations occur in the height of the tide. The _spring\r\ntides_, or those which rise to an unusual height twice a month, are\r\nproduced by the sun and moon's acting together; and the _neap tides_, or\r\nthose which are unusually low twice a month, are produced by the sun and\r\nmoon's acting in opposition to each other. The spring tides occur at the\r\nsyzygies: the neap tides at the quadratures. At the time of new moon,\r\nthe sun and moon both being on the same side of the earth, and acting\r\nupon it in the same line, their actions conspire, and the sun may be\r\nconsidered as adding so much to the force of the moon. We have already\r\nseen how the moon contributes to raise a tide on the opposite side of\r\nthe earth. But the sun, as well as the moon, raises its own tide-wave,\r\nwhich at new moon coincides with the lunar tide-wave. This will be plain\r\non inspecting the diagram, Fig. 47, on page 220, where S represents the\r\nsun, C, the moon in conjunction, O, the moon in opposition, and Z, N,\r\nthe tide-wave. Since the sun and moon severally raise a tide-wave, and\r\nthe two here coincide, it is evident that a peculiarly high tide must\r\noccur when the two bodies are in conjunction, or at new moon. At full\r\nmoon, also, the two luminaries conspire in the same way to raise the\r\ntide; for we must recollect that each body contributes to raise a tide\r\non the opposite side. Thus, when the sun is at S and the moon at O, the\r\nsun draws the waters on the side next to it away from the earth, and\r\nthe moon draws the earth away from the waters on that side; their united\r\nactions, therefore, conspire, and an unusually high tide is the result.\r\nOn the side next to O, the two forces likewise conspire: for while the\r\nmoon draws the waters away from the earth, the sun draws the earth away\r\nfrom the waters. In both cases an unusually low tide is produced; for\r\nthe more the water is elevated at Z and N, the more it will be depressed\r\nat H and R, the places of low tide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 47.]\r\n\r\nTwice a month, also, namely, at the quadratures of the moon, the tides\r\nneither rise so high nor fall so low as at other times, because then the\r\nsun and moon act against each other. Thus, in Fig. 48, while F tends to\r\nraise the water at Z, S tends to depress it, and consequently the high\r\ntide is less than usual. Again, while F tends to depress the water at R,\r\nS tends to elevate it, and therefore the low tide is less than usual.\r\nHence the difference between high and low water is only half as great at\r\nneap as at spring tide. In the diagrams, the elevation and depression of\r\nthe waters is represented, for the sake of illustration, as far greater\r\nthan it really is; for you must recollect that the average height of the\r\ntides for the whole globe is only about two and a half feet, a quantity\r\nso small, in comparison with the diameter of the earth, that were the\r\ndue proportions preserved in the figures, the effect would be wholly\r\ninsensible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe variations of distance in the sun are not great enough to influence\r\nthe tides very materially, but the variations in the moon's distances\r\nhave a striking effect. The tides which happen, when the moon is in\r\nperigee, are considerably greater than when she is in apogee; and if she\r\nhappens to be in perigee at the time of the syzygies, the spring tides\r\nare unusually high.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the tide-wave is not a _progressive_ motion, but a mere\r\nundulation, and is to be carefully distinguished from the currents to\r\nwhich it gives rise. If the ocean completely covered the earth, the sun\r\nand moon being in the equator, the tide-wave would travel at the same\r\nrate as the earth revolves on its axis. Indeed, the correct way of\r\nconceiving of the tide-wave, is to consider the moon at rest, and the\r\nearth, in its rotation from west to east, as bringing successive\r\nportions of water under the moon, which portions being elevated\r\nsuccessively, at the same rate as the earth revolves on its axis, have a\r\nrelative motion westward, at the same rate.\r\n\r\nThe tides of rivers, narrow bays, and shores far from the main body of\r\nthe ocean, are not produced in those places by the direct action of the\r\nsun and moon, but are subordinate waves propagated from the great\r\ntide-wave, and are called _derivative_ tides, while those raised\r\ndirectly by the sun and moon are called _primitive_ tides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 49.]\r\n\r\nThe velocity with which the tide moves will depend on various\r\ncircumstances, but principally on the depth, and probably on the\r\nregularity, of the channel. If the depth is nearly uniform the tides\r\nwill be regular; but if some parts of the channel are deep while others\r\nare shallow, the waters will be detained by the greater friction of the\r\nshallow places, and the tides will be irregular. The direction, also, of\r\nthe derivative tide may be totally different from that of the primitive.\r\nThus, in Fig. 49, if the great tide-wave, moving from east to west, is\r\nrepresented by the lines 1, 2, 3, 4, the derivative tide, which is\r\npropagated up a river or bay, will be represented by the lines 3, 4, 5,\r\n6, 7. Advancing faster in the channel than next the bank, the tides will\r\nlag behind towards the shores, and the tide-wave will take the form of\r\ncurves, as represented in the diagram.\r\n\r\nOn account of the retarding influence of shoals, and an uneven, indented\r\ncoast, the tide-wave travels more slowly along the shores of an island\r\nthan in the neighboring sea, assuming convex figures at a little\r\ndistance from the island, and on opposite sides of it. These convex\r\nlines sometimes meet, and become blended in such a way, as to create\r\nsingular anomalies in a sea much broken by islands, as well as on coasts\r\nindented with numerous bays and rivers. Peculiar phenomena are also\r\nproduced, when the tide flows in at opposite extremities of a reef or\r\nisland, as into the two opposite ends of Long-Island Sound. In certain\r\ncases, a tide-wave is forced into a narrow arm of the sea, and produces\r\nvery remarkable tides. The tides of the Bay of Fundy (the highest in the\r\nworld) are ascribed to this cause. The tides on the coast of North\r\nAmerica are derived from the great tide-wave of the South Atlantic,\r\nwhich runs steadily northward along the coast to the mouth of the Bay of\r\nFundy, where it meets the northern tide-wave flowing in the opposite\r\ndirection. This accumulated wave being forced into the narrow space\r\noccupied by the Bay, produces the remarkable tide of that place.\r\n\r\nThe largest lakes and inland seas have no perceptible tides. This is\r\nasserted by all writers respecting the Caspian and Euxine; and the same\r\nis found to be true of the largest of the North-American lakes, Lake\r\nSuperior. Although these several tracts of water appear large, when\r\ntaken by themselves, yet they occupy but small portions of the surface\r\nof the globe, as will appear evident from the delineation of them on the\r\nartificial globe. Now, we must recollect that the primitive tides are\r\nproduced by the _unequal_ action of the sun and moon upon the different\r\nparts of the earth; and that it is only at points whose distance from\r\neach other bears a considerable ratio to the whole distance of the sun\r\nor moon, that the inequality of action becomes manifest. The space\r\nrequired to make the effect sensible is larger than either of these\r\ntracts of water. It is obvious, also, that they have no opportunity to\r\nbe subject to a derivative tide.\r\n\r\nAlthough all must admit that the tides have _some connexion_ with the\r\nsun and the moon, yet there are so many seeming anomalies, which at\r\nfirst appear irreconcilable with the theory of gravitation, that some\r\nare unwilling to admit the explanation given by this theory. Thus, the\r\nheight of the tide is so various, that at some places on the earth there\r\nis scarcely any tide at all, while at other places it rises to seventy\r\nfeet. The time of occurrence is also at many places wholly unconformable\r\nto the motions of the moon, as is required by the theory, being low\r\nwater where it should be high water; or, instead of appearing just\r\nbeneath the moon, as the theory would lead us to expect, following it at\r\nthe distance of six, ten, or even fifteen, hours; and finally, the moon\r\nsometimes appears to have no part at all in producing the tide, but it\r\nhappens uniformly at noon and midnight, (as is said to be the case at\r\nthe Society Islands,) and therefore seems wholly dependent on the sun.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these seeming inconsistencies with the law of universal\r\ngravitation, to which the explanation of the tides is referred, the\r\ncorrespondence of the tides to the motions of the sun and moon, in\r\nobedience to the law of attraction, is in general such as to warrant the\r\napplication of that law to them, while in a great majority of the cases\r\nwhich appear to be exceptions to the operation of that law, local causes\r\nand impediments have been discovered, which modified or overruled the\r\nuniform operation of the law of gravitation. Thus it does not disprove\r\nthe reality of the existence of a force which carries bodies near the\r\nsurface of the earth towards its centre, that we see them sometimes\r\ncompelled, by the operation of local causes, to move in the opposite\r\ndirection. A ball shot from a cannon is still subject to the law of\r\ngravitation, although, for a certain time, in obedience to the impulse\r\ngiven it, it may proceed in a line contrary to that in which gravity\r\nalone would carry it. The fact that water may be made to run up hill\r\ndoes not disprove the fact that it usually runs down hill by the force\r\nof gravity, or that it is still subject to this force, although, from\r\nthe action of modifying or superior forces, it may be proceeding in a\r\ndirection contrary to that given by gravity. Indeed, those who have\r\nstudied the doctrine of the tides most profoundly consider them as\r\naffording a striking and palpable exhibition of the truth of the\r\ndoctrine of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[11] The exact longitude of the City Hall, in the city of New York, is\r\n4h. 56m. 33.5s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XX.\r\n\r\nPLANETS.--MERCURY AND VENUS.\r\n\r\n    \"First, Mercury, amidst full tides of light,\r\n    Rolls next the sun, through his small circle bright;\r\n    Our earth would blaze beneath so fierce a ray,\r\n    And all its marble mountains melt away.\r\n    Fair Venus next fulfils her larger round,\r\n    With softer beams, and milder glory crowned;\r\n    Friend to mankind, she glitters from afar,\r\n    Now the bright evening, now the morning, star.\"--_Baker._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is no study in which more is to be hoped for from a lucid\r\narrangement, than in the study of astronomy. Some subjects involved in\r\nthis study appear very difficult and perplexing to the learner, before\r\nhe has fully learned the doctrine of the sphere, and gained a certain\r\nfamiliarity with astronomical doctrines, which would seem very easy to\r\nhim after he had made such attainments. Such an order ought to be\r\nobserved, as shall bring out the facts and doctrines of the science just\r\nin the place where the mind of the learner is prepared to receive them.\r\nSome writers on astronomy introduce their readers at once to the most\r\nperplexing part of the whole subject,--the planetary motions. I have\r\nthought a different course advisable, and have therefore commenced these\r\nLetters with an account of those bodies which are most familiarly known\r\nto us, the earth, the sun, and the moon. In connexion with the earth, we\r\nare able to acquire a good knowledge of the artificial divisions and\r\npoints of reference that are established on the earth and in the\r\nheavens, constituting the doctrine of the sphere. You thus became\r\nfamiliar with many terms and definitions which are used in astronomy.\r\nThese ought to be always very clearly borne in mind; and if you now meet\r\nwith any term, the definition of which you have either partially or\r\nwholly forgotten, let me strongly recommend to you, to turn back and\r\nreview it, until it becomes as familiar to you as household words.\r\nIndeed, you will find it much to your advantage to go back frequently,\r\nand reiterate the earlier parts of the subject, before you advance to\r\nsubjects of a more intricate nature. If this process should appear to\r\nyou a little tedious, still you will find yourself fully compensated by\r\nthe clear light in which all the succeeding subjects will appear. This\r\nclear and distinct perception of the ground we have been over shows us\r\njust where we are on our journey, and helps us to find the remainder of\r\nthe way with far greater ease than we could otherwise do. I do not,\r\nhowever, propose by any devices to relieve you from the trouble of\r\nthinking. Those who are not willing to incur this trouble can never\r\nlearn much of astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn introducing you to the planets, (which next claim our attention,) I\r\nwill, in the first place, endeavor to convey to you some clear views of\r\nthese bodies individually, and afterwards help you to form as correct a\r\nnotion as possible of their motions and mutual relations.\r\n\r\nThe name _planet_ is derived from a Greek word, (= planêtês=,\r\n_planetes_,) which signifies a _wanderer_, and is applied to this class\r\nof bodies, because they shift their positions in the heavens, whereas\r\nthe fixed stars constantly maintain the same places with respect to each\r\nother. The planets known from a high antiquity are, Mercury, Venus,\r\nEarth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. To these, in 1781, was added Uranus,\r\n(or _Herschel_, as it is sometimes called, from the name of its\r\ndiscoverer;) and, as late as the commencement of the present century,\r\nfour more were added, namely, Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta. These\r\nbodies are designated by the following characters:\r\n\r\n    1. Mercury, [Planet: Mercury]\r\n    2. Venus,   [Planet: Venus]\r\n    3. Earth,   [Planet: Earth]\r\n    4. Mars,    [Planet: Mars]\r\n    5. Vesta,   [Planet: Vesta]\r\n    6. Juno,    [Planet: Juno]\r\n    7. Ceres,   [Planet: Ceres]\r\n    8. Pallas,  [Planet: Pallas]\r\n    9. Jupiter, [Planet: Jupiter]\r\n    10. Saturn,  [Planet: Saturn]\r\n    11. Uranus,  [Planet: Uranus]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are called the _primary_ planets. Several of these have\r\none or more attendants, or satellites, which revolve around them as they\r\nrevolve around the sun. The Earth has one satellite, namely, the Moon;\r\nJupiter has four; Saturn, seven; and Uranus, six. These bodies are also\r\nplanets, but, in distinction from the others, they are called\r\n_secondary_ planets. Hence, the whole number of planets are twenty-nine,\r\nnamely, eleven primary, and eighteen secondary, planets.\r\n\r\nYou need never look for a planet either very far in the north or very\r\nfar in the south, since they are always near the ecliptic. Mercury,\r\nwhich deviates furthest from that great circle, never is seen more than\r\nseven degrees from it; and you will hardly ever see one of the planets\r\nso far from it as this, but they all pursue nearly the same great route\r\nthrough the skies, in their revolutions around the sun. The new planets,\r\nhowever, make wider excursions from the plane of the ecliptic,\r\namounting, in the case of Pallas, to thirty-four and a half degrees.\r\n\r\nMercury and Venus are called _inferior_ planets, because they have their\r\norbits nearer to the sun than that of the earth; while all the others,\r\nbeing more distant from the sun than the earth, are called _superior_\r\nplanets. The planets present great diversities among themselves, in\r\nrespect to distance from the sun, magnitude, time of revolution, and\r\ndensity. They differ, also, in regard to satellites, of which, as we\r\nhave seen, three have respectively four, six, and seven, while more than\r\nhalf have none at all. It will aid the memory, and render our view of\r\nthe planetary system more clear and comprehensive, if we classify, as\r\nfar as possible, the various particulars comprehended under the\r\nforegoing heads. As you have had an opportunity, in preceding Letters,\r\nof learning something respecting the means which astronomers have of\r\nascertaining the distances and magnitudes of these bodies, you will not\r\ndoubt that they are really as great as they are represented; but when\r\nyou attempt to conceive of spaces so vast, you will find the mind wholly\r\ninadequate to the task. It is indeed but a comparatively small space\r\nthat we can fully comprehend at one grasp. Still, by continual and\r\nrepeated efforts, we may, from time to time, somewhat enlarge the\r\nboundaries of our mental vision. Let us begin with some known and\r\nfamiliar space, as the distance between two places we are accustomed to\r\ntraverse. Suppose this to be one hundred miles. Taking this as our\r\nmeasure, let us apply it to some greater distance, as that across the\r\nAtlantic Ocean,--say three thousand miles. From this step we may advance\r\nto some faint conception of the diameter of the earth; and taking that\r\nas a new measure, we may apply it to such greater spaces as the distance\r\nof the planets from the sun. I hope you will make trial of this method\r\non the following comparative statements respecting the planets.\r\n\r\n    _Distances from the Sun, in miles._\r\n\r\n    1. Mercury,                37,000,000\r\n    2. Venus,                  68,000,000\r\n    3. Earth,                  95,000,000\r\n    4. Mars,                  142,000,000\r\n    5.

Uranus, or Herschel, 1800,000,000\r\n\r\nThe _dimensions_ of the planetary system are seen from this table to be\r\nvast, comprehending a circular space thirty-six hundred millions of\r\nmiles in diameter. A rail-way car, travelling constantly at the rate of\r\ntwenty miles an hour, would require more than twenty thousand years to\r\ncross the orbit of Uranus.\r\n\r\n    _Magnitudes._\r\n\r\n             Diam. in miles.\r\n    1. Mercury,   3140\r\n    2. Venus,     7700\r\n    3. Earth,     7912\r\n    4. Mars,      4200\r\n    5. Ceres,      160\r\n    6. Jupiter, 89,000\r\n    7. Saturn,  79,000\r\n    8. Uranus,  35,000\r\n\r\nWe remark here a great diversity in regard to magnitude,--a diversity\r\nwhich does not appear to be subject to any definite law. While Venus, an\r\ninferior planet, is nine tenths as large as the earth, Mars, a superior\r\nplanet, is only one seventh, while Jupiter is twelve hundred and\r\neighty-one times as large. Although several of the planets, when nearest\r\nto us, appear brilliant and large, when compared with most of the fixed\r\nstars, yet the angle which they subtend is very small,--that of Venus,\r\nthe greatest of all, never exceeding about one minute, which is less\r\nthan one thirtieth the apparent diameter of the sun or moon. Jupiter,\r\nalso, by his superior brightness, sometimes makes a striking figure\r\namong the stars; yet his greatest apparent diameter is less than one\r\nfortieth that of the sun.\r\n\r\n    _Periodic Times_.\r\n\r\n    Mercury revolves around the sun in nearly 3 months.\r\n    Venus,     \"       \"      \"          \"    7-1/2 \"\r\n    Earth,     \"       \"      \"          \"    1   year.\r\n    Mars,      \"       \"      \"          \"    2   years.\r\n    Ceres,     \"       \"      \"          \"    4-2/3 \"\r\n    Jupiter,   \"       \"      \"          \"    12    \"\r\n    Saturn,    \"       \"      \"          \"    29    \"\r\n    Uranus,    \"       \"      \"          \"    84    \"\r\n\r\nFrom this view, it appears that the planets nearest the sun move most\r\nrapidly. Thus, Mercury performs nearly three hundred and fifty\r\nrevolutions while Uranus performs one. The apparent progress of the most\r\ndistant planets around the sun is exceedingly slow. Uranus advances only\r\na little more than four degrees in a whole year; so that we find this\r\nplanet occupying the same sign, and of course remaining nearly in the\r\nsame part of the heavens, for several years in succession.\r\n\r\nAfter this comparative view of the planets in general, let us now look\r\nat them individually; and first, of the inferior planets, Mercury and\r\nVenus.\r\n\r\nMERCURY and VENUS, having their orbits so far within that of the earth,\r\nappear to us as attendants upon the sun. Mercury never appears further\r\nfrom the sun than twenty-nine degrees, and seldom so far; and Venus,\r\nnever more than about forty-seven degrees. Both planets, therefore,\r\nappear either in the west soon after sunset, or in the east a little\r\nbefore sunrise. In high latitudes, where the twilight is long, Mercury\r\ncan seldom be seen with the naked eye, and then only when its angular\r\ndistance from the sun is greatest. Copernicus, the great Prussian\r\nastronomer, (who first distinctly established the order of the solar\r\nsystem, as at present received,) lamented, on his death-bed, that he had\r\nnever been able to obtain a sight of Mercury; and Delambre, a\r\ndistinguished astronomer of France, saw it but twice. In our latitude,\r\nhowever, we may see this planet for several evenings and mornings, if we\r\nwill watch the time (as usually given in the almanac) when it is at its\r\ngreatest elongations from the sun. It will not, however, remain long for\r\nour gaze, but will soon run back to the sun. The reason of this will be\r\nreadily understood from the following diagram, Fig. 50. Let S represent\r\nthe sun, E, the earth, and M, N, Mercury at its greatest elongations\r\nfrom the sun, and O Z P, a portion of the sky. Then, since we refer all\r\ndistant bodies to the same concave sphere of the heavens, it is evident\r\nthat we should see the sun at Z, and Mercury at O, when at its greatest\r\neastern elongation, and at P, when at its greatest western elongation;\r\nand while passing from M to N through Q, it would appear to describe the\r\narc O P; and while passing from N to M through R, it would appear to run\r\nback across the sun on the same arc. It is further evident that it would\r\nbe visible only when at or near one of its greatest elongations; being\r\nat all other times so near the sun as to be lost in his light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 50.]\r\n\r\nA planet is said to be in _conjunction_ with the sun when it is seen in\r\nthe same part of the heavens with the sun. Mercury and Venus have each\r\ntwo conjunctions, the inferior and the superior conjunction. The\r\n_inferior conjunction_ is its position when in conjunction on the same\r\nside of the sun with the earth, as at Q, in the figure; the _superior\r\nconjunction_ is its position when on the side of the sun most distant\r\nfrom the earth, as at R.\r\n\r\nThe time which a planet occupies in making one entire circuit of the\r\nheavens, from any star, until it comes round to the same star again, is\r\ncalled its _sidereal revolution_. The period occupied by a planet\r\nbetween two successive conjunctions with the earth is called its\r\n_synodical revolution_. Both the planet and the earth being in motion,\r\nthe time of the synodical revolution of Mercury or Venus exceeds that of\r\nthe sidereal; for when the planet comes round to the place where it\r\nbefore overtook the earth, it does not find the earth at that point, but\r\nfar in advance of it. Thus, let Mercury come into inferior conjunction\r\nwith the earth at C, Fig. 51. In about eighty-eight days, the planet\r\nwill come round to the same point again; but, mean-while, the earth has\r\nmoved forward through the arc E E´, and will continue to move while the\r\nplanet is moving more rapidly to overtake her; the case being analogous\r\nto that of the hour and minute hand of a clock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 51.]\r\n\r\nThe synodical period of Mercury is one hundred and sixteen days, and\r\nthat of Venus five hundred and eighty-four days. The former is increased\r\ntwenty-eight days, and the latter, three hundred and sixty days, by the\r\nmotion of the earth; so that Venus, after being in conjunction with the\r\nearth, goes more than twice round the sun before she comes into\r\nconjunction again. For, since the earth is likewise in motion, and moves\r\nmore than half as fast as Venus, by the time the latter has gone round\r\nand returned to the place where the two bodies were together, the earth\r\nis more than half way round, and continues moving, so that it will be a\r\nlong time before Venus comes up with it.\r\n\r\nThe motion of an inferior planet is _direct_ in passing through its\r\nsuperior conjunction, and _retrograde_ in passing through its inferior\r\nconjunction. You will recollect that the motion of a heavenly body is\r\nsaid to be direct when it is in the order of the signs from west to\r\neast, and retrograde when it is contrary to the order of the signs, or\r\nfrom east to west. Now Venus, while going from B through D to A, (Fig.\r\n51,) moves from west to east, and would appear to traverse the celestial\r\nvault B´ S´ A´, from right to left; but in passing from A through C to\r\nB, her course would be retrograde, returning on the same arc from left\r\nto right. If the earth were at rest, therefore, (and the sun, of course,\r\nat rest,) the inferior planets would appear to oscillate backwards and\r\nforwards across the sun. But it must be recollected that the earth is\r\nmoving in the same direction with the planet, as respects the signs, but\r\nwith a slower motion. This modifies the motions of the planet,\r\naccelerating it in the superior, and retarding it in the inferior,\r\nconjunction. Thus, in Fig. 51, Venus, while moving through B D A, would\r\nseem to move in the heavens from B´ to A´, were the earth at rest; but,\r\nmean-while, the earth changes its position from E to E´, on which\r\naccount the planet is not seen at A´, but at A´´, being accelerated by\r\nthe arc A´ A´´, in consequence of the earth's motion. On the other hand,\r\nwhen the planet is passing through its inferior conjunction A C B, it\r\nappears to move backwards in the heavens from A´ to B´, if the earth is\r\nat rest, but from A´ to B´´, if the earth has in the mean time moved\r\nfrom E to E´, being retarded by the arc B´ B´´. Although the motions of\r\nthe earth have the effect to accelerate the planet in the superior\r\nconjunction, and to retard it in the inferior, yet, on account of the\r\ngreater distance, the apparent motion of the planet is much slower in\r\nthe superior than in the inferior conjunction, Venus being the whole\r\nbreadth of her orbit, or one hundred and thirty-six millions of miles\r\nfurther from us when at her greatest, than when at her least, distance,\r\nas is evident from Fig. 51. When passing from the superior to the\r\ninferior conjunction, or from the inferior to the superior, through the\r\ngreatest elongations, the inferior planets are _stationary_. Thus, (Fig.\r\n51,) when the planet is at A, the earth being at E, as the planet's\r\nmotion is directly towards the spectator, he would constantly project it\r\nat the same point in the heavens, namely, A´; consequently, it would\r\nappear to stand still. Or, when at its greatest elongation on the other\r\nside, at B, as its motion would be directly from the spectator, it would\r\nbe seen constantly at B´. If the earth were at rest, the stationary\r\npoints would be at the greatest elongations, as at A and B; but the\r\nearth itself is moving nearly at right angles to the planet's motion,\r\nwhich makes the planet appear to move in the opposite direction. Its\r\ndirect motion will therefore continue longer on the one side, and its\r\nretrograde motion longer on the other side, than would be the case, were\r\nit not for the motion of the earth. Mercury, whose greatest angular\r\ndistance from the sun is nearly twenty-nine degrees, is stationary at an\r\nelongation of from fifteen to twenty degrees; and Venus, at about\r\ntwenty-nine degrees, although her greatest elongation is about\r\nforty-seven degrees.\r\n\r\nMercury and Venus exhibit to the telescope _phases_ similar to those of\r\nthe moon. When on the side of their inferior conjunction, as from B to C\r\nthrough D, Fig. 52, less than half their enlightened disk is turned\r\ntowards us, and they appear horned, like the moon in her first and last\r\nquarters; and when on the side of the superior conjunction, as from C to\r\nB through A, more than half the enlightened disk is turned towards us,\r\nand they appear gibbous. At the moment of superior conjunction, the\r\nwhole enlightened orb of the planet is turned towards the earth, and the\r\nappearance would be that of the full moon; but the planet is too near\r\nthe sun to be commonly visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\nWe should at first thought expect, that each of these planets would be\r\nlargest and brightest near their inferior conjunction, being then so\r\nmuch nearer to us than at other times; but we must recollect that, when\r\nin this situation, only a small part of the enlightened disk is turned\r\ntoward us. Still, the period of greatest brilliancy cannot be when most\r\nof the illuminated side is turned towards us, for then, being at the\r\nsuperior conjunction, its light will be diminished, both by its great\r\ndistance, and by its being so near the sun as to be partially lost in\r\nthe twilight. Hence, when Venus is a little within her place of greatest\r\nelongation, about forty degrees from the sun, although less than half\r\nher disk is enlightened, yet, being comparatively near to us, and\r\nshining at a considerable altitude after the evening or before the\r\nmorning twilight, she then appears in greatest splendor, and presents an\r\nobject admired for its beauty in all ages. Thus Milton,\r\n\r\n    \"Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,\r\n    If better thou belong not to the dawn,\r\n    Sure pledge of day that crown'st the smiling morn\r\n    With thy bright circlet.\"\r\n\r\nMercury and Venus both _revolve on their axes_ in nearly the same time\r\nwith the earth. The diurnal period of Mercury is a little greater, and\r\nthat of Venus a little less, than twenty-four hours. These revolutions\r\nhave been determined by means of some spot or mark seen by the\r\ntelescope, as the revolution of the sun on his axis is ascertained by\r\nmeans of his spots. Mercury owes most of its peculiarities to its\r\nproximity to the sun. Its light and heat, derived from the sun, are\r\nestimated to be neatly seven times as great as on the earth, and the\r\napparent magnitude of the sun to a spectator on Mercury would be seven\r\ntimes greater than to us. Hence the sun would present to an inhabitant\r\nof that planet, with eyes like ours, an object of insufferable\r\nbrightness; and all objects on the surface would be arrayed in a light\r\nmore glorious than we can well imagine. (See Fig. 53.) The average heat\r\non the greater portion of this planet would exceed that of boiling\r\nwater, and therefore be incompatible with the existence both of an\r\nanimal and a vegetable kingdom constituted like ours.\r\n\r\nThe motion of Mercury, in his revolution round the sun, is swifter than\r\nthat of any other planet, being more than one hundred thousand miles\r\nevery hour; whereas that of the earth is less than seventy thousand.\r\nEighteen hundred miles every minute,--crossing the Atlantic ocean in\r\nless than two minutes,--this is a velocity of which we can form but a\r\nvery inadequate conception, although, as we shall see hereafter, it is\r\nfar less than comets sometimes exhibit.\r\n\r\nVenus is regarded as the most beautiful of the planets, and is well\r\nknown as the _morning and evening star_. The most ancient nations,\r\nindeed, did not recognise the morning and evening star as one and the\r\nsame body, but supposed they were different planets, and accordingly\r\ngave them different names, calling the morning star Lucifer, and the\r\nevening star Hesperus. At her period of greatest splendor, Venus casts a\r\nshadow, and is sometimes visible in broad daylight. Her light is then\r\nestimated as equal to that of twenty stars of the first magnitude. In\r\nthe equatorial regions of the earth, where the twilight is short, and\r\nVenus, at her greatest elongation, appears very high above the\r\nhorizon, her splendors are said to be far more conspicuous than in\r\nour latitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 53. APPARENT MAGNITUDES OF THE SUN, AS SEEN FROM THE\r\nDIFFERENT PLANETS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration Figures 54, 55, 56. VENUS AND MARS.]\r\n\r\nEvery eight years, Venus forms her conjunction with the sun in the same\r\npart of the heavens. Whatever appearances, therefore, arise from her\r\nposition with respect to the earth and the sun, they are repeated every\r\neight years, in nearly the same form.\r\n\r\nThus, every eight years, Venus is remarkably conspicuous, so as to be\r\nvisible in the day-time, being then most favorably situated, on several\r\naccounts; namely, being nearest the earth, and at the point in her orbit\r\nwhere she gives her greatest brilliancy, that is, a little within the\r\nplace of greatest elongation. This is the period for obtaining fine\r\ntelescopic views of Venus, when she is seen with spots on her disk. Thus\r\ntwo figures of the annexed diagram (Fig. 54) represent Venus as seen\r\nnear her inferior conjunction, and at the period of maximum brilliancy.\r\nThe former situation is favorable for viewing her inequalities of\r\nsurface, as indicated by the roughness of the line which separates the\r\nenlightened from the unenlightened part, (the _terminator_.) According\r\nto Schroeter, a German astronomer, Venus has mountains twenty-two miles\r\nhigh. Her mountains, however, are much more difficult to be seen than\r\nthose of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe sun would appear, as seen from Venus, twice as large as on the\r\nearth, and its light and heat would be augmented in the same proportion.\r\n(See Fig. 53.) In many respects, however, the phenomena of this planet\r\nare similar to those of our own; and the general likeness between Venus\r\nand the earth, in regard to dimensions, revolutions, and seasons, is\r\ngreater than exists between any other two bodies of the system.\r\n\r\nI will only add to the present Letter a few words on the _transits_ of\r\nthe inferior planets.\r\n\r\nThe transit of Mercury or Venus is its passage across the sun's disk, as\r\nthe moon passes over it in a solar eclipse. The planet is seen projected\r\non the sun's disk in a small, black, round spot, moving slowly over the\r\nface of the sun. As the transit takes place only when the planet is in\r\ninferior conjunction, at which time her motion is retrograde, it is\r\nalways from left to right; and, on account of its motion being retarded\r\nby the motion of the earth, (as was explained by Fig. 51, page 232,) it\r\nremains sometimes a long time on the solar disk. Mercury, when it makes\r\nits transit across the sun's centre, may remain on the sun from five to\r\nseven hours.\r\n\r\nYou may ask, why we do not observe this appearance every time one of the\r\ninferior planets comes into inferior conjunction, for then, of course,\r\nit passes between us and the sun. It must, indeed, at this time, cross\r\nthe meridian at the same time with the sun; but, because its orbit is\r\ninclined to that of the sun, it may cross it (and generally does) a\r\nlittle above or a little below the sun. It is only when the conjunction\r\ntakes place at or very near the point where the two orbits cross one\r\nanother, that is, near the _node_, that a transit can occur. Thus, if\r\nthe orbit of Mercury, N M R, Fig. 50, (page 231,) were in the same plane\r\nwith the earth's orbit, (and of course with the sun's apparent orbit,)\r\nthen, when the planet was at Q, in its inferior conjunction, the earth\r\nbeing at E, it would always be projected on the sun's disk at Z, on the\r\nconcave sphere of the heavens, and a transit would happen at every\r\ninferior conjunction. But now let us take hold of the point R, and lift\r\nthe circle which represents the orbit of Mercury upwards seven degrees,\r\nletting it turn upon the diameter _d b_; then, we may easily see that a\r\nspectator at E would project the planet higher in the heavens than the\r\nsun; and such would always be the case, except when the conjunction\r\ntakes place at the node. Then the point of intersection of the two\r\norbits being in one and the same plane, both bodies would be referred to\r\nthe same point on the celestial sphere. As the sun, in his apparent\r\nrevolution around the earth every year, passes through every point in\r\nthe ecliptic, of course he must every year be at each of the points\r\nwhere the orbit of Mercury or Venus crosses the ecliptic, that is, at\r\neach of the nodes of one of these planets;[12] and as these nodes are on\r\nopposite sides of the ecliptic, consequently, the sun will pass through\r\nthem at opposite seasons of the year, as in January and July, February\r\nand August. Now, should Mercury or Venus happen to come between us and\r\nthe sun, just as the sun is passing one of the planet's nodes, a transit\r\nwould happen. Hence the transits of Mercury take place in May and\r\nNovember, and those of Venus, in June and December.\r\n\r\nTransits of Mercury occur more frequently than those of Venus. The\r\nperiodic times of Mercury and the earth are so adjusted to each other,\r\nthat Mercury performs nearly twenty-nine revolutions while the earth\r\nperforms seven. If, therefore, the two bodies meet at the node in any\r\ngiven year, seven years afterwards they will meet nearly at the same\r\nnode, and a transit may take place, accordingly, at intervals of seven\r\nyears. But fifty-four revolutions of Mercury correspond still nearer to\r\nthirteen revolutions of the earth; and therefore a transit is still more\r\nprobable after intervals of thirteen years. At intervals of thirty-three\r\nyears, transits of Mercury are exceedingly probable, because in that\r\ntime Mercury makes almost exactly one hundred and thirty-seven\r\nrevolutions. Intermediate transits, however, may occur at the other\r\nnode. Thus, transits of Mercury happened at the ascending node in 1815,\r\nand 1822, at intervals of seven years; and at the descending node in\r\n1832, which will return in 1845, after thirteen years.\r\n\r\nTransits of Venus are events of very unfrequent occurrence. Eight\r\nrevolutions of the earth are completed in nearly the same time as\r\nthirteen revolutions of Venus; and hence two transits of Venus may occur\r\nafter an interval of eight years, as was the case at the last return of\r\nthe phenomenon, one transit having occurred in 1761, and another in\r\n1769. But if a transit does not happen after eight years, it will not\r\nhappen at the same node, until an interval of two hundred and\r\nthirty-five years: but intermediate transits may occur at the other\r\nnode. The next transit of Venus will take place in 1874, being two\r\nhundred and thirty-five years after the first that was ever _observed_,\r\nwhich occurred in 1639. This was seen, for the first time by mortal\r\neyes, by two youthful English astronomers, Horrox and Crabtree. Horrox\r\nwas a young man of extraordinary promise, and indicated early talents\r\nfor practical astronomy, which augured the highest eminence; but he died\r\nin the twenty-third year of his age. He was only twenty when the transit\r\nappeared, and he had made the calculations and observations, by which he\r\nwas enabled to anticipate its arrival several years before. At the\r\napproach of the desired time for observing the transit, he received the\r\nsun's image through a telescope in a dark room upon a white piece of\r\npaper, and after waiting many hours with great impatience, (as his\r\ncalculation did not lead him to a knowledge of the precise time of the\r\noccurrence,) at last, on the twenty-fourth of November, 1639, old style,\r\nat three and a quarter hours past twelve, just as he returned from\r\nchurch, he had the pleasure to find a large round spot near the limb of\r\nthe sun's image. It moved slowly across the sun's disk, but had not\r\nentirely left it when the sun set.\r\n\r\nThe great interest attached by astronomers to a transit of Venus arises\r\nfrom its furnishing the most accurate means in our power of determining\r\nthe _sun's horizontal parallax_,--an element of great importance, since\r\nit leads us to a knowledge of the distance of the earth from the sun,\r\nwhich again affords the means of estimating the distances of all the\r\nother planets, and possibly, of the fixed stars. Hence, in 1769, great\r\nefforts were made throughout the civilized world, under the patronage of\r\ndifferent governments, to observe this phenomenon under circumstances\r\nthe most favorable for determining the parallax of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe common methods of finding the parallax of a heavenly body cannot be\r\nrelied on to a greater degree of accuracy than four seconds. In the case\r\nof the moon, whose greatest parallax amounts to about one degree, this\r\ndeviation from absolute accuracy is not very material; but it amounts to\r\nnearly half the entire parallax of the sun.\r\n\r\nIf the sun and Venus were equally distant from us, they would be equally\r\naffected by parallax, as viewed by spectators in different parts of the\r\nearth, and hence their _relative_ situation would not be altered by it;\r\nbut since Venus, at the inferior conjunction, is only about one third as\r\nfar off as the sun, her parallax is proportionally greater, and\r\ntherefore spectators at distant points will see Venus projected on\r\ndifferent parts of the solar disk, as the planet traverses the disk.\r\nAstronomers avail themselves of this circumstance to ascertain the sun's\r\nhorizontal parallax, which they are enabled to do by comparing it with\r\nthat of Venus, in a manner which, without a knowledge of trigonometry,\r\nyou will not fully understand. In order to make the difference in the\r\napparent places of Venus on the sun's disk as great as possible, very\r\ndistant places are selected for observation. Thus, in the transits of\r\n1761 and 1769, several of the European governments fitted out expensive\r\nexpeditions to parts of the earth remote from each other. For this\r\npurpose, the celebrated Captain Cook, in 1769, went to the South Pacific\r\nOcean, and observed the transit at the island of Otaheite, while others\r\nwent to Lapland, for the same purpose, and others still, to many other\r\nparts of the globe. Thus, suppose two observers took their stations on\r\nopposite sides of the earth, as at A, and B, Fig. 57, page 242; at A,\r\nthe planet V would be seen on the sun's disk at _a_, while at B, it\r\nwould be seen at _b_.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Venus on the sun's disk being that of a well-defined\r\nblack spot, and the exactness with which the moment of external or\r\ninternal contact may be determined, are circumstances favorable to the\r\nexactness of the result; and astronomers repose so much confidence in\r\nthe estimation of the sun's horizontal parallax, as derived from\r\nobservations on the transit of 1769, that this important element is\r\nthought to be ascertained within one tenth of a second. The general\r\nresult of all these observations gives the sun's horizontal parallax\r\neight seconds and six tenths,--a result which shows at once that the sun\r\nmust be a great way off, since the semidiameter of the earth, a line\r\nnearly four thousand miles in length, would appear at the sun under an\r\nangle less than one four hundredth of a degree. During the transits of\r\nVenus over the sun's disk, in 1761 and 1769, a sort of penumbral light\r\nwas observed around the planet, by several astronomers, which was\r\nthought to indicate an _atmosphere_. This appearance was particularly\r\nobservable while the planet was coming on or going off the solar disk.\r\nThe total immersion and emersion were not instantaneous; but as two\r\ndrops of water, when about to separate, form a ligament between them, so\r\nthere was a dark shade stretched out between Venus and the sun; and when\r\nthe ligament broke, the planet seemed to have got about an eighth part\r\nof her diameter from the limb of the sun. The various accounts of the\r\ntwo transits abound with remarks like these, which indicate the\r\nexistence of an atmosphere about Venus of nearly the density and extent\r\nof the earth's atmosphere. Similar proofs of the existence of an\r\natmosphere around this planet are derived from appearances of twilight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nThe elder astronomers imagined that they had discovered a _satellite_\r\naccompanying Venus in her transit. If Venus had in reality any\r\nsatellite, the fact would be obvious at her transits, as, in some of\r\nthem at least, it is probable that the satellite would be projected near\r\nthe primary on the sun's disk; but later astronomers have searched in\r\nvain for any appearances of the kind, and the inference is, that former\r\nastronomers were deceived by some optical illusion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[12] You will recollect that the sun is said to be at the node, when the\r\nplaces of the node and the sun are both projected, by a spectator on the\r\nearth, upon the same part of the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXI.\r\n\r\nSUPERIOR PLANETS: MARS, JUPITER, SATURN, AND URANUS.\r\n\r\n    \"With what an awful, world-revolving power,\r\n    Were first the unwieldy planets launched along\r\n    The illimitable void! There to remain\r\n    Amidst the flux of many thousand years,\r\n    That oft has swept the toiling race of men,\r\n    And all their labored monuments, away.\"--_Thomson._\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY AND VENUS, as we have seen, are always observed near the sun,\r\nand from this circumstance, as well as from the changes of magnitude and\r\nform which they undergo, we know that they have their orbits within that\r\nof the earth, and hence we call them _inferior_ planets. On the other\r\nhand, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, exhibit such appearances, at\r\ndifferent times, as show that they revolve around the sun at a greater\r\ndistance than the earth, and hence we denominate them _superior_\r\nplanets. We know that they never come between us and the sun, because\r\nthey never undergo those changes which Mercury and Venus, as well as the\r\nmoon, sustain, in consequence of their coming into such a position.\r\nThey, however, wander to the greatest angular distance from the sun,\r\nbeing sometimes seen one hundred and eighty degrees from him, so as to\r\nrise when the sun sets. All these different appearances must naturally\r\nresult from their orbits' being exterior to that of the earth, as will\r\nbe evident from the following representation. Let E, Fig. 58, page 244,\r\nbe the earth, and M, one of the superior planets, Mars, for example,\r\neach body being seen in its path around the sun. At M, the planet would\r\nbe in opposition to the sun, like the moon at the full; at Q and Q´, it\r\nwould be seen ninety degrees off, or in quadrature; and at M´, in\r\nconjunction. We know, however, that this must be a superior and not an\r\ninferior conjunction, for the illuminated disk is still turned towards\r\nus; whereas, if it came between us and the sun, like Mercury, or Venus,\r\nin its inferior conjunction, its dark side would be presented to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\nThe superior planets do not exhibit to the telescope different phases,\r\nbut, with a single exception, they always present the side that is\r\nturned towards the earth fully enlightened. This is owing to their great\r\ndistance from the earth; for were the spectator to stand upon the sun,\r\nhe would of course always have the illuminated side of each of the\r\nplanets turned towards him; but so distant are all the superior planets,\r\nexcept Mars, that they are viewed by us very nearly, in the same manner\r\nas they would be if we actually stood on the sun. Mars, however, is\r\nsufficiently near to appear somewhat gibbous when at or near one of its\r\nquadratures. Thus, when the planet is at Q, it is plain that, of the\r\nhemisphere that is turned towards the earth, a small part is\r\nunilluminated.\r\n\r\nMars is a small planet, his diameter being only about half that of the\r\nearth, or four thousand two hundred miles. He also, at times, comes\r\nnearer to the earth than any other planet, except Venus. His _mean_\r\ndistance from the sun is one hundred and forty-two millions of miles;\r\nbut his orbit is so elliptical, that his distance varies much in\r\ndifferent parts of his revolution. Mars is always very near the\r\necliptic, never varying from it more than two degrees. He is\r\ndistinguished from all the planets by his deep red color, and fiery\r\naspect; but his brightness and apparent magnitude vary much, at\r\ndifferent times, being sometimes nearer to us than at others by the\r\nwhole diameter of the earth's orbit; that is, by about one hundred and\r\nninety millions of miles. When Mars is on the same side of the sun with\r\nthe earth, or at his opposition, he comes within forty-seven millions of\r\nmiles of the earth, and, rising about the time the sun sets, surprises\r\nus by his magnitude and splendor; but when he passes to the other side\r\nof the sun, to his superior conjunction, he dwindles to the appearance\r\nof a small star, being then two hundred and thirty-seven millions of\r\nmiles from us. Thus, let M, Fig, 58, represent Mars in opposition, and\r\nM´, in the superior conjunction, while E represents the earth. It is\r\nobvious that, in the former situation, the planet must be nearer to the\r\nearth than in the latter, by the whole diameter of the earth's orbit.\r\nWhen viewed with a powerful telescope, the surface of Mars appears\r\ndiversified with numerous varieties of light and shade. The region\r\naround the poles is marked by white spots, (see Fig. 56, page 237,)\r\nwhich vary their appearances with the changes of seasons in the planet.\r\nHence Dr. Herschel conjectured that they were owing to ice and snow,\r\nwhich alternately accumulate and melt away, according as it is Winter or\r\nSummer, in that region. They are greatest and most conspicuous when that\r\npart of the planet has just emerged from a long Winter, and they\r\ngradually waste away, as they are exposed to the solar heat. Fig. 56,\r\nrepresents the planet, as exhibited, under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances, to a powerful telescope, at the time when its gibbous\r\nform is strikingly obvious. It has been common to ascribe the ruddy\r\nlight of Mars to an extensive and dense atmosphere, which was said to be\r\ndistinctly indicated by the gradual diminution of light observed in a\r\nstar, as it approaches very near to the planet, in undergoing an\r\noccultation; but more recent observations afford no such evidence of an\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nBy observations on the spots, we learn that Mars revolves on his axis in\r\nvery nearly the same time with the earth, (twenty-four hours thirty-nine\r\nminutes twenty-one seconds and three tenths,) and that the inclination\r\nof his axis to that of his orbit is also nearly the same, being thirty\r\ndegrees eighteen minutes ten seconds and eight tenths. Hence the changes\r\nof day and night must be nearly the same there as here, and the seasons\r\nalso very similar to ours. Since, however, the distance of Mars from the\r\nsun is one hundred and forty-two while that of the earth is only\r\nninety-five millions of miles, the sun will appear more than twice as\r\nsmall on that planet as on ours, (see Fig. 53, page 236,) and its light\r\nand heat will be diminished in the same proportion. Only the equatorial\r\nregions, therefore, will be suitable for the existence of animals and\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nThe earth will be seen from Mars as an inferior planet, always near the\r\nsun, presenting appearances similar, in many respects, to those which\r\nVenus presents to us. It will be to that planet the evening and morning\r\nstar, sung by their poets (if poets they have) with a like enthusiasm.\r\nThe moon will attend the earth as a little star, being never seen\r\nfurther from her side than about the diameter under which we view the\r\nmoon. To the telescope, the earth will exhibit phases similar to those\r\nof Venus; and, finally, she will, at long intervals, make her transits\r\nover the solar disk. Mean-while, Venus will stand to Mars in a relation\r\nsimilar to that of Mercury [Illustration Figures 59, 60. JUPITER AND\r\nSATURN.] to us, revealing herself only when at the periods of her\r\ngreatest elongation, and at all other times hiding herself within the\r\nsolar blaze. Mercury will never be visible to an inhabitant of Mars.\r\n\r\nJupiter is distinguished from all the other planets by his great\r\n_magnitude_. His diameter is eighty-nine thousand miles, and his volume\r\none thousand two hundred and eighty times that of the earth. His figure\r\nis strikingly spheroidal, the equatorial being more than six thousand\r\nmiles longer than the polar diameter. Such a figure might naturally be\r\nexpected from the rapidity of his diurnal rotation, which is\r\naccomplished in about ten hours. A place on the equator of Jupiter must\r\nturn twenty-seven times as fast as on the terrestrial equator. The\r\ndistance of Jupiter from the sun is nearly four hundred and ninety\r\nmillions of miles, and his revolution around the sun occupies nearly\r\ntwelve years. Every thing appertaining to Jupiter is on a grand scale. A\r\nworld in itself, equal in dimensions to twelve hundred and eighty of\r\nours; the whole firmament rolling round it in the short space of ten\r\nhours, a movement so rapid that the eye could probably perceive the\r\nheavenly bodies to change their places every moment; its year dragging\r\nout a length of more than four thousand days, and more than ten thousand\r\nof its own days, while its nocturnal skies are lighted up with four\r\nbrilliant moons;--these are some of the peculiarities which characterize\r\nthis magnificent planet.\r\n\r\nThe view of Jupiter through a good telescope is one of the most splendid\r\nand interesting spectacles in astronomy. The disk expands into a large\r\nand bright orb, like the full moon; the spheroidal figure which theory\r\nassigns to revolving spheres, especially to those which turn with great\r\nvelocity, is here palpably exhibited to the eye; across the disk,\r\narranged in parallel stripes, are discerned several dusky bands, called\r\n_belts_; and four bright satellites, always in attendance, and ever\r\nvarying their positions, compose a splendid retinue. Indeed, astronomers\r\ngaze with peculiar interest on Jupiter and his moons, as affording a\r\nminiature representation of the whole solar system, repeating, on a\r\nsmaller scale, the same revolutions, and exemplifying more within the\r\ncompass of our observation, the same laws as regulate the entire\r\nassemblage of sun and planets. Figure 59, facing page 247, gives a\r\ncorrect view of Jupiter, as exhibited to a powerful telescope in a clear\r\nevening. You will remark his flattened or spheroidal figure, the belts\r\nwhich appear in parallel stripes across his disk, and the four\r\nsatellites, that are seen like little stars in a straight line with the\r\nequator of the planet.\r\n\r\nThe _belts of Jupiter_ are variable in their number and dimensions. With\r\nthe smaller telescopes only one or two are seen, and those across the\r\nequatorial regions; but with more powerful instruments, the number is\r\nincreased, covering a large part of the entire disk. Different opinions\r\nhave been entertained by astronomers respecting the cause of these\r\nbelts; but they have generally been regarded as clouds formed in the\r\natmosphere of the planet, agitated by winds, as is indicated by their\r\nfrequent changes, and made to assume the form of belts parallel to the\r\nequator, like currents that circulate around our globe. Sir John\r\nHerschel supposes that the belts are not ranges of clouds, but portions\r\nof the planet itself, brought into view by the removal of clouds and\r\nmists, that exist in the atmosphere of the planet, through which are\r\nopenings made by currents circulating around Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe _satellites of Jupiter_ may be seen with a telescope of very\r\nmoderate powers. Even a common spyglass will enable us to discern them.\r\nIndeed, one or two of them have been occasionally seen with the naked\r\neye. In the largest telescopes they severally appear as bright as\r\nSirius. With such an instrument, the view of Jupiter, with his moons and\r\nbelts, is truly a magnificent spectacle. As the orbits of the satellites\r\ndo not deviate far from the plane of the ecliptic, and but little from\r\nthe equator of the planet, they are usually seen in nearly a straight\r\nline with each other, extending across the central part of the disk.\r\n(See Fig. 59, facing page 247.)\r\n\r\nJupiter and his satellites exhibit in miniature all the phenomena of the\r\nsolar system. The satellites perform, around their primary, revolutions\r\nvery analogous to those which the planets perform around the sun,\r\nhaving, in like manner, motions alternately direct, stationary, and\r\nretrograde. They are all, with one exception, a little larger than the\r\nmoon; and the second satellite, which is the smallest, is nearly as\r\nlarge as the moon, being two thousand and sixty-eight miles in diameter.\r\nThey are all very small compared with the primary, the largest being\r\nonly one twenty-sixth part of the primary. The outermost satellite\r\nextends to the distance from the planet of fourteen times his diameter.\r\nThe whole system, therefore, occupies a region of space more than one\r\nmillion miles in breadth. Rapidity of motion, as well as greatness of\r\ndimensions, is characteristic of the system of Jupiter. I have already\r\nmentioned that the planet itself has a motion on its own axis much\r\nswifter than that of the earth, and the motions of the satellites are\r\nalso much more rapid than that of the moon. The innermost, which is a\r\nlittle further off than the moon is from the earth, goes round its\r\nprimary in about a day and three quarters; and the outermost occupies\r\nless than seventeen days.\r\n\r\nThe orbits of the satellites are nearly or quite circular, and deviate\r\nbut little from the plane of the planet's equator, and of course are but\r\nslightly inclined to the plane of his orbit. They are therefore in a\r\nsimilar situation with respect to Jupiter, as the moon would be with\r\nrespect to the earth, if her orbit nearly coincided with the ecliptic,\r\nin which case, she would undergo an eclipse at every opposition. The\r\neclipses of Jupiter's satellites, in their general circumstances, are\r\nperfectly analogous to those of the moon, but in their details they\r\ndiffer in several particulars. Owing to the much greater distance of\r\nJupiter from the sun, and its greater magnitude, the cone of its shadow\r\nis much longer and larger than that of the earth. On this account, as\r\nwell as on account of the little inclination of their orbit to that of\r\nthe primary, the three inner satellites of Jupiter pass through his\r\nshadow, and are totally eclipsed, at every revolution. The fourth\r\nsatellite, owing to the greater inclination of its orbit, sometimes,\r\nthough rarely, escapes eclipse, and sometimes merely grazes the limits\r\nof the shadow, or suffers a partial eclipse. These eclipses, moreover,\r\nare not seen, as is the case with those of the moon, from the centre of\r\ntheir motion, but from a remote station, and one whose situation with\r\nrespect to the line of the shadow is variable. This makes no difference\r\nin the _times_ of the eclipses, but it makes a very great one in their\r\nvisibility, and in their apparent situations with respect to the planet\r\nat the moment of their entering or quitting the shadow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\nThe eclipses of Jupiter's satellites present some curious phenomena,\r\nwhich you will easily understand by studying the following diagram. Let\r\nA, B, C, D, Fig. 61, represent the earth in different parts of its\r\norbit; J, Jupiter, in his orbit, surrounded by his four satellites, the\r\norbits of which are marked 1, 2, 3, 4. At _a_, the first satellite\r\nenters the shadow of the planet, emerges from it at _b_, and advances to\r\nits greatest elongation at _c_. The other satellites traverse the shadow\r\nin a similar manner. The apparent place, with respect to the planet, at\r\nwhich these eclipses will be seen to occur, will be altered by the\r\nposition the earth happens at that moment to have in its orbit; but\r\ntheir appearances for any given night, as exhibited at Greenwich, are\r\ncalculated and accurately laid down in the Nautical Almanac.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the satellites is passing between Jupiter and the sun, it\r\ncasts its shadow on the primary, as the moon casts its shadow on the\r\nearth in a solar eclipse. We see with the telescope the shadow\r\ntraversing the disk. Sometimes, the satellite itself is seen projected\r\non the disk; but, being illuminated as well as the primary, it is not so\r\neasily distinguished as Venus or Mercury, when seen on the sun's disk in\r\none of their transits, since these bodies have their dark sides turned\r\ntowards us; but the satellite is illuminated by the sun, as well as the\r\nprimary, and therefore is not easily distinguishable from it.\r\n\r\nThe eclipses of Jupiter's satellites have been studied with great\r\nattention by astronomers, on account of their affording one of the\r\neasiest methods of determining the _longitude_. On this subject, Sir\r\nJohn Herschel remarks: \"The discovery of Jupiter's satellites by\r\nGalileo, which was one of the first fruits of the invention of the\r\ntelescope, forms one of the most memorable epochs in the history of\r\nastronomy. The first astronomical solution of the problem of 'the\r\nlongitude,'--the most important problem for the interests of mankind\r\nthat has ever been brought under the dominion of strict scientific\r\nprinciples,--dates immediately from this discovery. The final and\r\nconclusive establishment of the Copernican system of astronomy may also\r\nbe considered as referable to the discovery and study of this exquisite\r\nminiature system, in which the laws of the planetary motions, as\r\nascertained by Kepler, and especially that which connects their periods\r\nand distances, were speedily traced, and found to be satisfactorily\r\nmaintained.\"\r\n\r\nThe entrance of one of Jupiter's satellites into the shadow of the\r\nprimary, being seen like the entrance of the moon into the earth's\r\nshadow at the same moment of absolute time, at all places where the\r\nplanet is visible, and being wholly independent of parallax, that is,\r\npresenting the same phenomenon to places remote from each other; being,\r\nmoreover, predicted beforehand, with great accuracy, for the instant of\r\nits occurrence at Greenwich, and given in the Nautical Almanac; this\r\nwould seem to be one of those events which are peculiarly adapted for\r\nfinding the longitude. For you will recollect, that \"any instantaneous\r\nappearance in the heavens, visible at the same moment of absolute time\r\nat any two places, may be employed for determining the difference of\r\nlongitude between those places; for the difference in their local times,\r\nas indicated by clocks or chronometers, allowing fifteen degrees for\r\nevery hour, will show their difference of longitude.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the method by the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, it\r\nmust be remarked, that the extinction of light in the satellite, at its\r\nimmersion, and the recovery of its light at its emersion, are not\r\ninstantaneous, but gradual; for the satellite, like the moon, occupies\r\nsome time in entering into the shadow, or in emerging from it, which\r\noccasions a progressive diminution or increase of light. Two observers\r\nin the same room, observing with different telescopes the same eclipse,\r\nwill frequently disagree, in noting its time, to the amount of fifteen\r\nor twenty seconds. Better methods, therefore, of finding the longitude,\r\nare now employed, although the facility with which the necessary\r\nobservations can be made, and the little calculation required, still\r\nrender this method eligible in many cases where extreme accuracy is not\r\nimportant. As a telescope is essential for observing an eclipse of one\r\nof the satellites, it is obvious that this method cannot be practised at\r\nsea, since the telescope cannot be used on board of ship, for want of\r\nthe requisite steadiness.\r\n\r\nThe grand discovery of the _progressive motion of light_ was first made\r\nby observations on the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. In the year\r\n1675, it was remarked by Roemer, a Danish astronomer, on comparing\r\ntogether observations of these eclipses during many successive years,\r\nthat they take place sooner by about sixteen minutes, when the earth is\r\non the same side of the sun with the planet, than when she is on the\r\nopposite side. The difference he ascribes to the progressive motion of\r\nlight, which takes that time to pass through the diameter of the earth's\r\norbit, making the velocity of light about one hundred and ninety-two\r\nthousand miles per second. So great a velocity startled astronomers at\r\nfirst, and produced some degree of distrust of this explanation of the\r\nphenomenon; but the subsequent discovery of what is called the\r\naberration of light, led to an independent estimation of the velocity of\r\nlight, with almost precisely the same result.\r\n\r\nFew greater feats have ever been performed by the human mind, than to\r\nmeasure the speed of light,--a speed so great, as would carry it across\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean in the sixty-fourth part of a second, and around the\r\nglobe in less than the seventh part of a second! Thus has man applied\r\nhis scale to the motions of an element, that literally leaps from world\r\nto world in the twinkling of an eye. This is one example of the great\r\npower which the invention of the telescope conferred on man.\r\n\r\nCould we plant ourselves on the surface of this vast planet, we should\r\nsee the same starry firmament expanding over our heads as we see now;\r\nand the same would be true if we could fly from one planetary world to\r\nanother, until we made the circuit of them all; but the sun and the\r\nplanetary system would present themselves to us under new and strange\r\naspects. The sun himself would dwindle to one twenty-seventh of his\r\npresent surface, (Fig. 53, facing page 236,) and afford a degree of\r\nlight and heat proportionally diminished; Mercury, Venus, and even the\r\nEarth, would all disappear, being too near the sun to be visible; Mars\r\nwould be as seldom seen as Mercury is by us, and constitute the only\r\ninferior planet. On the other hand, Saturn would shine with greatly\r\naugmented size and splendor. When in opposition to the sun, (at which\r\ntime it comes nearest to Jupiter,) it would be a grand object, appearing\r\nlarger than either Venus or Jupiter does to us. When, however, passing\r\nto the other side of the sun, through its superior conjunction, it would\r\ngradually diminish in size and brightness, and at length become much\r\nless than it ever appears to us, since it would then be four hundred\r\nmillions of miles further from Jupiter than it ever is from us.\r\n\r\nAlthough Jupiter comes four hundred millions of miles nearer to Uranus\r\nthan the earth does, yet it is still thirteen hundred millions of miles\r\ndistant from that planet. Hence the augmentation of the magnitude and\r\nlight of Uranus would be barely sufficient to render it distinguishable\r\nby the naked eye. It appears, therefore, that Saturn is the peculiar\r\nornament of the firmament of Jupiter, and would present to the telescope\r\nmost interesting and sublime phenomena. As we owe the revelation of the\r\nsystem of Jupiter and his attendant worlds wholly to the telescope, and\r\nas the discovery and observation of them constituted a large portion of\r\nthe glory of Galileo, I am now forcibly reminded of his labors, and will\r\nrecur to his history, and finish the sketch which I commenced in a\r\nprevious Letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXII.\r\n\r\nCOPERNICUS.--GALILEO.\r\n\r\n    \"They leave at length the nether gloom, and stand\r\n    Before the portals of a better land;\r\n    To happier plains they come, and fairer groves,\r\n    The seats of those whom Heaven, benignant, loves;\r\n    A brighter day, a bluer ether, spreads\r\n    Its lucid depths above their favored heads;\r\n    And, purged from mists that veil our earthly skies,\r\n    Shine suns and stars unseen by mortal eyes.\"--_Virgil._\r\n\r\n\r\nIN order to appreciate the value of the contributions which Galileo made\r\nto astronomy, soon after the invention of the telescope, it is necessary\r\nto glance at the state of the science when he commenced his discoveries\r\nFor many centuries, during the middle ages, a dark night had hung over\r\nastronomy, through which hardly a ray of light penetrated, when, in the\r\neastern part of civilized Europe, a luminary appeared, that proved the\r\nharbinger of a bright and glorious day. This was Copernicus, a native of\r\nThorn, in Prussia. He was born in 1473. Though destined for the\r\nprofession of medicine, from his earliest years he displayed a great\r\nfondness and genius for mathematical studies, and pursued them with\r\ndistinguished success in the University of Cracow. At the age of\r\ntwenty-five years, he resorted to Italy, for the purpose of studying\r\nastronomy, where he resided a number of years. Thus prepared, he\r\nreturned to his native country, and, having acquired an ecclesiastical\r\nliving that was adequate to his support in his frugal mode of life, he\r\nestablished himself at Frauenberg, a small town near the mouth of the\r\nVistula, where he spent nearly forty years in observing the heavens, and\r\nmeditating on the celestial motions. He occupied the upper part of a\r\nhumble farm-house, through the roof of which he could find access to an\r\nunobstructed sky, and there he carried on his observations. His\r\ninstruments, however, were few and imperfect, and it does not appear\r\nthat he added any thing to the art of practical astronomy. This was\r\nreserved for Tycho Brahe, who came a half a century after him. Nor did\r\nCopernicus enrich the science with any important discoveries. It was not\r\nso much his genius or taste to search for new bodies, or new phenomena\r\namong the stars, as it was to explain the reasons of the most obvious\r\nand well-known appearances and motions of the heavenly bodies. With this\r\nview, he gave his mind to long-continued and profound meditation.\r\n\r\nCopernicus tells us that he was first led to think that the apparent\r\nmotions of the heavenly bodies, in their diurnal revolution, were owing\r\nto the real motion of the earth in the opposite direction, from\r\nobserving instances of the same kind among terrestrial objects; as when\r\nthe shore seems to the mariner to recede, as he rapidly sails from it;\r\nand as trees and other objects seem to glide by us, when, on riding\r\nswiftly past them, we lose the consciousness of our own motion. He was\r\nalso smitten with the _simplicity_ prevalent in all the works and\r\noperations of Nature, which is more and more conspicuous the more they\r\nare understood; and he hence concluded that the planets do not move in\r\nthe complicated paths which most preceding astronomers assigned to them.\r\nI shall explain to you, hereafter, the details of his system. I need\r\nonly at present remind you that the hypothesis which he espoused and\r\ndefended, (being substantially the same as that proposed by Pythagoras,\r\nfive hundred years before the Christian era,) supposes, first, that the\r\napparent movements of the sun by day, and of the moon and stars by\r\nnight, from east to west, result from the actual revolution of the earth\r\non its own axis from west to east; and, secondly, that the earth and all\r\nthe planets revolve about the sun in circular orbits. This hypothesis,\r\nwhen he first assumed it, was with him, as it had been with Pythagoras,\r\nlittle more than mere conjecture. The arguments by which its truth was\r\nto be finally established were not yet developed, and could not be,\r\nwithout the aid of the telescope, which was not yet invented. Upon this\r\nhypothesis, however, he set out to explain all the phenomena of the\r\nvisible heavens,--as the diurnal revolutions of the sun, moon, and\r\nstars, the slow progress of the planets through the signs of the zodiac,\r\nand the numerous irregularities to which the planetary motions are\r\nsubject. These last are apparently so capricious,--being for some time\r\nforward, then stationary, then backward, then stationary again, and\r\nfinally direct, a second time, in the order of the signs, and constantly\r\nvarying in the velocity of their movements,--that nothing but\r\nlong-continued and severe meditation could have solved all these\r\nappearances, in conformity with the idea that each planet is pursuing\r\nits simple way all the while in a circle around the sun. Although,\r\ntherefore, Pythagoras fathomed the profound doctrine that the sun is the\r\ncentre around which the earth and all the planets revolve, yet we have\r\nno evidence that he ever solved the irregular motions of the planets in\r\nconformity with his hypothesis, although the explanation of the diurnal\r\nrevolution of the heavens, by that hypothesis, involved no difficulty.\r\nIgnorant as Copernicus was of the principle of gravitation, and of most\r\nof the laws of motion, he could go but little way in following out the\r\nconsequences of his own hypothesis; and all that can be claimed for him\r\nis, that he solved, by means of it, most of the common phenomena of the\r\ncelestial motions. He indeed got upon the road to truth, and advanced\r\nsome way in its sure path; but he was able to adduce but few independent\r\nproofs, to show that it was the truth. It was only quite at the close of\r\nhis life that he published his system to the world, and that only at the\r\nurgent request of his friends; anticipating, perhaps, the opposition of\r\na bigoted priesthood, whose fury was afterwards poured upon the head of\r\nGalileo, for maintaining the same doctrines.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, the system of Copernicus afforded an explanation of\r\nthe celestial motions, far more simple and rational than the previous\r\nsystems which made the earth the centre of those motions, yet this fact\r\nalone was not sufficient to compel the assent of astronomers; for the\r\ngreater part, to say the least, of the same phenomena, could be\r\nexplained on either hypothesis. With the old doctrine astronomers were\r\nalready familiar, a circumstance which made it seem easier; while the\r\nnew doctrines would seem more difficult, from their being imperfectly\r\nunderstood. Accordingly, for nearly a century after the publication of\r\nthe system of Copernicus, he gained few disciples. Tycho Brahe rejected\r\nit, and proposed one of his own, of which I shall hereafter give you\r\nsome account; and it would probably have fallen quite into oblivion, had\r\nnot the observations of Galileo, with his newly-invented telescope,\r\nbrought to light innumerable proofs of its truth, far more cogent than\r\nany which Copernicus himself had been able to devise.\r\n\r\nGalileo no sooner had completed his telescope, and directed it to the\r\nheavens, than a world of wonders suddenly burst upon his enraptured\r\nsight. Pointing it to the moon, he was presented with a sight of her\r\nmottled disk, and of her mountains and valleys. The sun exhibited his\r\nspots; Venus, her phases; and Jupiter, his expanded orb, and his retinue\r\nof moons. These last he named, in honor of his patron, Cosmo d'Medici,\r\n_Medicean stars_. So great was this honor deemed of associating one's\r\nname with the stars, that express application was made to Galileo, by\r\nthe court of France, to award this distinction to the reigning Monarch,\r\nHenry the Fourth, with plain intimations, that by so doing he would\r\nrender himself and his family rich and powerful for ever.\r\n\r\nGalileo published the result of his discoveries in a paper, denominated\r\n'_Nuncius Sidereus_,' the 'Messenger of the Stars.' In that ignorant and\r\nmarvellous age, this publication produced a wonderful excitement. \"Many\r\ndoubted, many positively refused to believe, so novel an announcement;\r\nall were struck with the greatest astonishment, according to their\r\nrespective opinions, either at the new view of the universe thus offered\r\nto them, or at the high audacity of Galileo, in inventing such fables.\"\r\nEven Kepler, the great German astronomer, of whom I shall tell you more\r\nby and by, wrote to Galileo, and desired him to supply him with\r\narguments, by which he might answer the objections to these pretended\r\ndiscoveries with which he was continually assailed. Galileo answered him\r\nas follows: \"In the first place, I return you my thanks that you first,\r\nand almost alone, before the question had been sifted, (such is your\r\ncandor, and the loftiness of your mind,) put faith in my assertions. You\r\ntell me you have some telescopes, but not sufficiently good to magnify\r\ndistant objects with clearness, and that you anxiously expect a sight of\r\nmine, which magnifies images more than a thousand times. It is mine no\r\nlonger, for the Grand Duke of Tuscany has asked it of me, and intends to\r\nlay it up in his museum, among his most rare and precious curiosities,\r\nin eternal remembrance of the invention.\r\n\r\n\"You ask, my dear Kepler, for other testimonies. I produce, for one, the\r\nGrand Duke, who, after observing the Medicean planets several times with\r\nme at Pisa, during the last months, made me a present, at parting, of\r\nmore than a thousand florins, and has now invited me to attach myself to\r\nhim, with the annual salary of one thousand florins, and with the title\r\nof 'Philosopher and Principal Mathematician to His Highness;' without\r\nthe duties of any office to perform, but with the most complete leisure.\r\nI produce, for another witness, myself, who, although already endowed in\r\nthis College with the noble salary of one thousand florins, such as no\r\nprofessor of mathematics ever before received, and which I might\r\nsecurely enjoy during my life, even if these planets should deceive me\r\nand should disappear, yet quit this situation, and take me where want\r\nand disgrace will be my punishment, should I prove to have been\r\nmistaken.\"\r\n\r\nThe learned professors in the universities, who, in those days, were\r\nunaccustomed to employ their senses in inquiring into the phenomena of\r\nNature, but satisfied themselves with the authority of Aristotle, on all\r\nsubjects, were among the most incredulous with respect to the\r\ndiscoveries of Galileo. \"Oh, my dear Kepler,\" says Galileo, \"how I wish\r\nthat we could have one hearty laugh together. Here, at Padua, is the\r\nprincipal Professor of Philosophy, whom I have repeatedly and urgently\r\nrequested to look at the moon and planets through my glass, which he\r\npertinaciously refuses to do. Why are you not here? What shouts of\r\nlaughter we should have at this glorious folly, and to hear the\r\nProfessor of Philosophy at Pisa laboring before the Grand Duke, with\r\nlogical arguments, as if with magical incantations, to charm the new\r\nplanets out of the sky.\"\r\n\r\nThe following argument by Sizzi, a contemporary astronomer of some note,\r\nto prove that there can be only seven planets, is a specimen of the\r\nlogic with which Galileo was assailed. \"There are seven windows given\r\nto animals in the domicile of the head, through which the air is\r\nadmitted to the tabernacle of the body, to enlighten, to warm, and to\r\nnourish it; which windows are the principal parts of the microcosm, or\r\nlittle world,--two nostrils, two eyes, two ears, and one mouth. So in\r\nthe heavens, as in a macrocosm, or great world, there are two favorable\r\nstars, Jupiter and Venus; two unpropitious, Mars and Saturn; two\r\nluminaries, the Sun and Moon; and Mercury alone, undecided and\r\nindifferent. From which, and from many other phenomena of Nature, such\r\nas the seven metals, &c., which it were tedious to enumerate, we gather\r\nthat the number of planets is necessarily seven. Moreover, the\r\nsatellites are invisible to the naked eye, and therefore can exercise no\r\ninfluence over the earth, and therefore would be useless, and therefore\r\ndo not exist. Besides, as well the Jews and other ancient nations, as\r\nmodern Europeans, have adopted the division of the week into seven days,\r\nand have named them from the seven planets. Now, if we increase the\r\nnumber of planets, this whole system falls to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, at length, the astronomers of the schools found it useless to deny\r\nthe fact that Jupiter is attended by smaller bodies, which revolve\r\naround him, they shifted their ground of warfare, and asserted that\r\nGalileo had not told the whole truth; that there were not merely _four_\r\nsatellites, but a still greater number; one said five; another, nine;\r\nand another, twelve; but, in a little time, Jupiter moved forward in his\r\norbit, and left all behind him, save the four Medicean stars.\r\n\r\nIt had been objected to the Copernican system, that were Venus a body\r\nwhich revolved around the sun in an orbit interior to that of the earth,\r\nshe would undergo changes similar to those of the moon. As no such\r\nchanges could be detected by the naked eye, no satisfactory answer could\r\nbe given to this objection; but the telescope set all right, by showing,\r\nin fact, the phases of Venus. The same instrument, disclosed, also, in\r\nthe system of Jupiter and his moons, a miniature exhibition of the solar\r\nsystem itself. It showed the actual existence of the motion of a number\r\nof bodies around one central orb, exactly similar to that which was\r\npredicated of the sun and planets. Every one, therefore, of these new\r\nand interesting discoveries, helped to confirm the truth of the system\r\nof Copernicus.\r\n\r\nBut a fearful cloud was now rising over Galileo, which spread itself,\r\nand grew darker every hour. The Church of Rome had taken alarm at the\r\nnew doctrines respecting the earth's motion, as contrary to the\r\ndeclarations of the Bible, and a formidable difficulty presented itself,\r\nnamely, how to publish and defend these doctrines, without invoking the\r\nterrible punishments inflicted by the Inquisition on heretics. No work\r\ncould be printed without license from the court of Rome; and any\r\nopinions supposed to be held and much more known to be taught by any\r\none, which, by an ignorant and superstitious priesthood, could be\r\ninterpreted as contrary to Scripture, would expose the offender to the\r\nseverest punishments, even to imprisonment, scourging, and death. We,\r\nwho live in an age so distinguished for freedom of thought and opinion,\r\ncan form but a very inadequate conception of the bondage in which the\r\nminds of men were held by the chains of the Inquisition. It was\r\nnecessary, therefore, for Galileo to proceed with the greatest caution\r\nin promulgating truths which his own discoveries had confirmed. He did\r\nnot, like the Christian martyrs, proclaim the truth in the face of\r\npersecutions and tortures; but while he sought to give currency to the\r\nCopernican doctrines, he labored, at the same time, by cunning\r\nartifices, to blind the ecclesiastics to his real designs, and thus to\r\nescape the effects of their hostility.\r\n\r\nBefore Galileo published his doctrines in form, he had expressed himself\r\nso freely, as to have excited much alarm among the ecclesiastics. One of\r\nthem preached publicly against him, taking for his text, the passage,\r\n\"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye here gazing up into heaven?\" He\r\ntherefore thought it prudent to resort to Rome, and confront his enemies\r\nface to face. A contemporary describes his appearance there in the\r\nfollowing terms, in a letter addressed to a Romish Cardinal: \"Your\r\nEminence would be delighted with Galileo, if you heard him holding\r\nforth, as he often does, in the midst of fifteen or twenty, all\r\nviolently attacking him, sometimes in one house, sometimes in another.\r\nBut he is armed after such fashion, that he laughs all of them to scorn;\r\nand even if the novelty of his opinions prevents entire persuasion, at\r\nleast he convicts of emptiness most of the arguments with which his\r\nadversaries endeavor to overwhelm him.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1616, Galileo, as he himself states, had a most gracious audience of\r\nthe Pope, Paul the Fifth, which lasted for nearly an hour, at the end of\r\nwhich his Holiness assured him, that the Congregation were no longer in\r\na humor to listen lightly to calumnies against him, and that so long as\r\nhe occupied the Papal chair, Galileo might think himself out of all\r\ndanger. Nevertheless, he was not allowed to return home, without\r\nreceiving formal notice not to teach the opinions of Copernicus, \"that\r\nthe sun is in the centre of the system, and that the earth moves about\r\nit,\" from that time forward, in any manner.\r\n\r\nGalileo had a most sarcastic vein, and often rallied his persecutors\r\nwith the keenest irony. This he exhibited, some time after quitting\r\nRome, in an epistle which he sent to the Arch Duke Leopold, accompanying\r\nhis 'Theory of the Tides.' \"This theory,\" says he, \"occurred to me when\r\nin Rome, whilst the theologians were debating on the prohibition of\r\nCopernicus's book, and of the opinion maintained in it of the motion of\r\nthe earth, which I at that time believed; until it pleased those\r\ngentlemen to suspend the book, and to declare the opinion false and\r\nrepugnant to the Holy Scriptures. Now, as I know how well it becomes me\r\nto obey and believe the decisions of my superiors, which proceed out of\r\nmore profound knowledge than the weakness of my intellect can attain\r\nto, this theory, which I send you, which is founded on the motion of the\r\nearth, I now look upon as a fiction and a dream, and beg your Highness\r\nto receive it as such. But, as poets often learn to prize the creations\r\nof their fancy, so, in like manner, do I set some value on this\r\nabsurdity of mine. It is true, that when I sketched this little work, I\r\ndid hope that Copernicus would not, after eighty years, be convicted of\r\nerror; and I had intended to develope and amplify it further; but a\r\nvoice from heaven suddenly awakened me, and at once annihilated all my\r\nconfused and entangled fancies.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, however, sometimes to decide whether the language of\r\nGalileo is ironical, or whether he uses it with subtlety, with the hope\r\nof evading the anathemas of the Inquisition. Thus he ends one of his\r\nwritings with the following passage: \"In conclusion, since the motion\r\nattributed to the earth, which I, as a pious and Catholic person,\r\nconsider most false, and not to exist, accommodates itself so well to\r\nexplain so many and such different phenomena, I shall not feel sure\r\nthat, false as it is, it may not just as deludingly correspond with the\r\nphenomena of comets.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1624, soon after the accession of Urban the Eighth to the\r\nPontifical chair, Galileo went to Rome again, to offer his\r\ncongratulations to the new Pope, as well as to propitiate his favor. He\r\nseems to have been received with unexpected cordiality; and, on his\r\ndeparture, the Pope commended him to the good graces of Ferdinand, Grand\r\nDuke of Tuscany, in the following terms: \"We find in him not only\r\nliterary distinction, but also the love of piety, and he is strong in\r\nthose qualities by which Pontifical good-will is easily obtained. And\r\nnow, when he has been brought to this city, to congratulate Us on Our\r\nelevation, We have lovingly embraced him; nor can We suffer him to\r\nreturn to the country whither your liberality recalls him, without an\r\nample provision of Pontifical love. And that you may know how dear he is\r\nto Us, we have willed to give him this honorable testimonial of virtue\r\nand piety. And We further signify, that every benefit which you shall\r\nconfer upon him will conduce to Our gratification.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1630, Galileo finished a great work, on which he had been\r\nlong engaged, entitled, 'The Dialogue on the Ptolemaic and Copernican\r\nSystems.' From the notion which prevailed, that he still countenanced\r\nthe Copernican doctrine of the earth's motion, which had been condemned\r\nas heretical, it was some time before he could obtain permission from\r\nthe Inquisitors (whose license was necessary to every book) to publish\r\nit. This he was able to do, only by employing again that duplicity or\r\nartifice which would throw dust in the eyes of the vain and\r\nsuperstitious priesthood. In 1632, the work appeared under the following\r\ntitle: 'A Dialogue, by Galileo Galilei, Extraordinary Mathematician of\r\nthe University of Pisa, and Principal Philosopher and Mathematician of\r\nthe Most Serene Grand Duke of Tuscany; in which, in a Conversation of\r\nfour days, are discussed the two principal Systems of the World, the\r\nPtolemaic and Copernican, indeterminately proposing the Philosophical\r\nArguments as well on one side as on the other.' The subtle disguise\r\nwhich he wore, may be seen from the following extract from his\r\n'Introduction,' addressed 'To the discreet Reader.'\r\n\r\n\"Some years ago, a salutary edict was promulgated at Rome, which, in\r\norder to obviate the perilous scandals of the present age, enjoined an\r\nopportune silence on the Pythagorean opinion of the earth's motion. Some\r\nwere not wanting, who rashly asserted that this decree originated, not\r\nin a judicious examination, but in ill-informed passion; and complaints\r\nwere heard, that counsellors totally inexperienced in astronomical\r\nobservations ought not, by hasty prohibitions, to clip the wings of\r\nspeculative minds. My zeal could not keep silence when I heard these\r\nrash lamentations, and I thought it proper, as being fully informed with\r\nregard to that most prudent determination, to appear publicly on the\r\ntheatre of the world, as a witness of the actual truth. I happened at\r\nthat time to be in Rome: I was admitted to the audiences, and enjoyed\r\nthe approbation, of the most eminent prelates of that court; nor did the\r\npublication of that decree occur without my receiving some prior\r\nintimation of it. Wherefore, it is my intention, in this present work,\r\nto show to foreign nations, that as much is known of this matter in\r\nItaly, and particularly in Rome, as ultramontane diligence can ever have\r\nformed any notion of, and collecting together all my own speculations on\r\nthe Copernican system, to give them to understand that the knowledge of\r\nall these preceded the Roman censures; and that from this country\r\nproceed not only dogmas for the salvation of the soul, but also\r\ningenious discoveries for the gratification of the understanding. With\r\nthis object, I have taken up in the 'Dialogue' the Copernican side of\r\nthe question, treating it as a pure mathematical hypothesis; and\r\nendeavoring, in every artificial manner, to represent it as having the\r\nadvantage, not over the opinion of the stability of the earth\r\nabsolutely, but according to the manner in which that opinion is\r\ndefended by some, who indeed profess to be Aristotelians, but retain\r\nonly the name, and are contented, without improvement, to worship\r\nshadows, not philosophizing with their own reason, but only from the\r\nrecollection of the four principles imperfectly understood.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the Pope himself, as well as the Inquisitors, had examined\r\nGalileo's manuscript, and, not having the sagacity to detect the real\r\nmotives of the author, had consented to its publication, yet, when the\r\nbook was out, the enemies of Galileo found means to alarm the court of\r\nRome, and Galileo was summoned to appear before the Inquisition. The\r\nphilosopher was then seventy years old, and very infirm, and it was with\r\ngreat difficulty that he performed the journey. His unequalled dignity\r\nand celebrity, however, commanded the involuntary respect of the\r\ntribunal before which he was summoned, which they manifested by\r\npermitting him to reside at the palace of his friend, the Tuscan\r\nAmbassador; and when it became necessary, in the course of the inquiry,\r\nto examine him in person, although his removal to the Holy Office was\r\nthen insisted upon, yet he was not, like other heretics, committed to\r\nclose and solitary confinement. On the contrary, he was lodged in the\r\napartments of the Head of the Inquisition, where he was allowed the\r\nattendance of his own servant, who was also permitted to sleep in an\r\nadjoining room, and to come and go at pleasure. These were deemed\r\nextraordinary indulgences in an age when the punishment of heretics\r\nusually began before their trial.\r\n\r\nAbout four months after Galileo's arrival in Rome, he was summoned to\r\nthe Holy Office. He was detained there during the whole of that day; and\r\non the next day was conducted, in a penitential dress, to the Convent of\r\nMinerva, where the Cardinals and Prelates, his judges, were assembled\r\nfor the purpose of passing judgement upon him, by which this venerable\r\nold man was solemnly called upon to renounce and abjure, as impious and\r\nheretical, the opinions which his whole existence had been consecrated\r\nto form and strengthen. Probably there is not a more curious document in\r\nthe history of science, than that which contains the sentence of the\r\nInquisition on Galileo, and his consequent abjuration. It teaches us so\r\nmuch, both of the darkness and bigotry of the terrible Inquisition, and\r\nof the sufferings encountered by those early martyrs of science, that I\r\nwill transcribe for your perusal, from the excellent 'Life of Galileo'\r\nin the 'Library of Useful Knowledge,' (from which I have borrowed much\r\nalready,) the entire record of this transaction. The sentence of the\r\nInquisition is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We, the undersigned, by the grace of God, Cardinals of the Holy Roman\r\nChurch, Inquisitors General throughout the whole Christian Republic,\r\nSpecial Deputies of the Holy Apostolical Chair against heretical\r\ndepravity:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, you, Galileo, son of the late Vincenzo Galilei of Florence,\r\naged seventy years, were denounced in 1615, to this Holy Office, for\r\nholding as true a false doctrine taught by many, namely, that the sun is\r\nimmovable in the centre of the world, and that the earth moves, and also\r\nwith a diurnal motion; also, for having pupils which you instructed in\r\nthe same opinions; also, for maintaining a correspondence on the same\r\nwith some German mathematicians; also, for publishing certain letters on\r\nthe solar spots, in which you developed the same doctrine as true; also,\r\nfor answering the objections which were continually produced from the\r\nHoly Scriptures, by glozing the said Scriptures, according to your own\r\nmeaning; and whereas, thereupon was produced the copy of a writing, in\r\nform of a letter, professedly written by you to a person formerly your\r\npupil, in which, following the hypothesis of Copernicus, you include\r\nseveral propositions contrary to the true sense and authority of the\r\nHoly Scriptures: therefore, this Holy Tribunal, being desirous of\r\nproviding against the disorder and mischief which was thence proceeding\r\nand increasing, to the detriment of the holy faith, by the desire of His\r\nHoliness, and of the Most Eminent Lords Cardinals of this supreme and\r\nuniversal Inquisition, the two propositions of the stability of the sun,\r\nand motion of the earth, were _qualified_ by the _Theological\r\nQualifiers_, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1. The proposition that the sun is in the centre of the world, and\r\nimmovable from its place, is absurd, philosophically false, and formally\r\nheretical; because it is expressly contrary to the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\n\"2. The proposition that the earth is not the centre of the world, nor\r\nimmovable, but that it moves, and also with a diurnal motion, is also\r\nabsurd, philosophically false, and, theologically considered, equally\r\nerroneous in faith.\r\n\r\n\"But whereas, being pleased at that time to deal mildly with you, it was\r\ndecreed in the Holy Congregation, held before His Holiness on the\r\ntwenty-fifth day of February, 1616, that His Eminence the Lord Cardinal\r\nBellarmine should enjoin you to give up altogether the said false\r\ndoctrine; if you should refuse, that you should be ordered by the\r\nCommissary of the Holy Office to relinquish it, not to teach it to\r\nothers, nor to defend it, and in default of the acquiescence, that you\r\nshould be imprisoned; and in execution of this decree, on the following\r\nday, at the palace, in presence of His Eminence the said Lord Cardinal\r\nBellarmine, after you had been mildly admonished by the said Lord\r\nCardinal, you were commanded by the acting Commissary of the Holy\r\nOffice, before a notary and witnesses, to relinquish altogether the said\r\nfalse opinion, and in future neither to defend nor teach it in any\r\nmanner, neither verbally nor in writing, and upon your promising\r\nobedience, you were dismissed.\r\n\r\n\"And, in order that so pernicious a doctrine might be altogether rooted\r\nout, nor insinuate itself further to the heavy detriment of the Catholic\r\ntruth, a decree emanated from the Holy Congregation of the Index,\r\nprohibiting the books which treat of this doctrine; and it was declared\r\nfalse, and altogether contrary to the Holy and Divine Scripture.\r\n\r\n\"And whereas, a book has since appeared, published at Florence last\r\nyear, the title of which showed that you were the author, which title\r\nis, '_The Dialogue of Galileo Galilei, on the two principal Systems of\r\nthe World, the Ptolemaic and Copernican_;' and whereas, the Holy\r\nCongregation has heard that, in consequence of printing the said book,\r\nthe false opinion of the earth's motion and stability of the sun is\r\ndaily gaining ground; the said book has been taken into careful\r\nconsideration, and in it has been detected a glaring violation of the\r\nsaid order, which had been intimated to you; inasmuch as in this book\r\nyou have defended the said opinion, already, and in your presence,\r\ncondemned; although in the said book you labor, with many\r\ncircumlocutions, to induce the belief that it is left by you undecided,\r\nand in express terms probable; which is equally a very grave error,\r\nsince an opinion can in no way be probable which has been already\r\ndeclared and finally determined contrary to the Divine Scripture.\r\nTherefore, by Our order, you have been cited to this Holy Office, where,\r\non your examination upon oath, you have acknowledged the said book as\r\nwritten and printed by you. You also confessed that you began to write\r\nthe said book ten or twelve years ago, after the order aforesaid had\r\nbeen given. Also, that you demanded license to publish it, but without\r\nsignifying to those who granted you this permission, that you had been\r\ncommanded not to hold, defend, or teach, the said doctrine in any\r\nmanner. You also confessed, that the style of said book was, in many\r\nplaces, so composed, that the reader might think the arguments adduced\r\non the false side to be so worded, as more effectually to entangle the\r\nunderstanding than to be easily solved, alleging, in excuse, that you\r\nhave thus run into an error, foreign (as you say) to your intention,\r\nfrom writing in the form of a dialogue, and in consequence of the\r\nnatural complacency which every one feels with regard to his own\r\nsubtilties, and in showing himself more skilful than the generality of\r\nmankind in contriving, even in favor of false propositions, ingenious\r\nand apparently probable arguments.\r\n\r\n\"And, upon a convenient time being given you for making your defence,\r\nyou produced a certificate in the handwriting of His Eminence, the Lord\r\nCardinal Bellarmine, procured, as you said, by yourself, that you might\r\ndefend yourself against the calumnies of your enemies, who reported that\r\nyou had abjured your opinions, and had been punished by the Holy Office;\r\nin which certificate it is declared, that you had not abjured, nor had\r\nbeen punished, but merely that the declaration made by his Holiness, and\r\npromulgated by the Holy Congregation of the Index, had been announced to\r\nyou, which declares that the opinion of the motion of the earth, and\r\nstability of the sun, is contrary to the Holy Scriptures, and therefore\r\ncannot be held or defended. Wherefore, since no mention is there made of\r\ntwo articles of the order, to wit, the order 'not to teach,' and 'in any\r\nmanner,' you argued that we ought to believe that, in the lapse of\r\nfourteen or sixteen years, they had escaped your memory, and that this\r\nwas also the reason why you were silent as to the order, when you sought\r\npermission to publish your book, and that this is said by you, not to\r\nexcuse your error, but that it may be attributed to vain-glorious\r\nambition rather than to malice. But this very certificate, produced on\r\nyour behalf, has greatly aggravated your offence, since it is therein\r\ndeclared, that the said opinion is contrary to the Holy Scriptures, and\r\nyet you have dared to treat of it, and to argue that it is probable; nor\r\nis there any extenuation in the license artfully and cunningly extorted\r\nby you, since you did not intimate the command imposed upon you. But\r\nwhereas, it appeared to Us that you had not disclosed the whole truth\r\nwith regard to your intentions, We thought it necessary to proceed to\r\nthe rigorous examination of you, in which (without any prejudice to what\r\nyou had confessed, and which is above detailed against you, with regard\r\nto your said intention) you answered like a good Catholic.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, having seen and maturely considered the merits of your\r\ncause, with your said confessions and excuses, and every thing else\r\nwhich ought to be seen and considered, We have come to the underwritten\r\nfinal sentence against you:\r\n\r\n\"Invoking, therefore, the most holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and\r\nof his Most Glorious Virgin Mother, Mary, by this Our final sentence,\r\nwhich, sitting in council and judgement for the tribunal of the Reverend\r\nMasters of Sacred Theology, and Doctors of both Laws, Our Assessors, We\r\nput forth in this writing touching the matters and controversies before\r\nUs, between the Magnificent Charles Sincerus, Doctor of both Laws,\r\nFiscal Proctor of this Holy Office, of the one part, and you, Galileo\r\nGalilei, an examined and confessed criminal from this present writing\r\nnow in progress, as above, of the other part, We pronounce, judge, and\r\ndeclare, that you, the said Galileo, by reason of these things which\r\nhave been detailed in the course of this writing, and which, as above,\r\nyou have confessed, have rendered yourself vehemently suspected, by this\r\nHoly Office, of heresy; that is to say, that you believe and hold the\r\nfalse doctrine, and contrary to the Holy and Divine Scriptures, namely,\r\nthat the sun is the centre of the world, and that it does not move from\r\neast to west, and that the earth does move, and is not the centre of the\r\nworld; also, that an opinion can be held and supported, as probable,\r\nafter it has been declared and finally decreed contrary to the Holy\r\nScripture, and consequently, that you have incurred all the censures and\r\npenalties enjoined and promulgated in the sacred canons, and other\r\ngeneral and particular constitutions against delinquents of this\r\ndescription. From which it is Our pleasure that you be absolved,\r\nprovided that, with a sincere heart and unfeigned faith, in Our\r\npresence, you abjure, curse, and detest, the said errors and heresies,\r\nand every other error and heresy, contrary to the Catholic and Apostolic\r\nChurch of Rome, in the form now shown to you.\r\n\r\n\"But that your grievous and pernicious error and transgression may not\r\ngo altogether unpunished, and that you may be made more cautious in\r\nfuture, and may be a warning to others to abstain from delinquencies of\r\nthis sort, We decree, that the book of the Dialogues of Galileo Galilei\r\nbe prohibited by a public edict, and We condemn you to the formal prison\r\nof this Holy Office for a period determinable at Our pleasure; and, by\r\nway of salutary penance, We order you, during the next three years, to\r\nrecite, once a week, the seven penitential psalms, reserving to\r\nOurselves the power of moderating, commuting, or taking off the whole or\r\npart of the said punishment, or penance.\r\n\r\n\"And so We say, pronounce, and by Our sentence declare, decree, and\r\nreserve, in this and in every other better form and manner, which\r\nlawfully We may and can use. So We, the subscribing Cardinals,\r\npronounce.\" [Subscribed by seven Cardinals.]\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the foregoing sentence, Galileo was made to kneel\r\nbefore the Inquisition, and make the following _Abjuration_:\r\n\r\n\"I, Galileo Galilei, son of the late Vincenzo Galilei, of Florence, aged\r\nseventy years, being brought personally to judgement, and kneeling\r\nbefore you, Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lords Cardinals, General\r\nInquisitors of the Universal Christian Republic against heretical\r\ndepravity, having before my eyes the Holy Gospels, which I touch with my\r\nown hands, swear, that I have always believed, and with the help of God\r\nwill in future believe, every article which the Holy Catholic and\r\nApostolic Church of Rome holds, teaches, and preaches. But because I had\r\nbeen enjoined, by this Holy Office, altogether to abandon the false\r\nopinion which maintains that the sun is the centre and immovable, and\r\nforbidden to hold, defend, or teach, the said false doctrine, in any\r\nmanner: and after it had been signified to me that the said doctrine is\r\nrepugnant to the Holy Scripture, I have written and printed a book, in\r\nwhich I treat of the same doctrine now condemned, and adduce reasons\r\nwith great force in support of the same, without giving any solution,\r\nand therefore have been judged grievously suspected of heresy; that is\r\nto say, that I held and believed that the sun is the centre of the world\r\nand immovable, and that the earth is not the centre and movable;\r\nwilling, therefore, to remove from the minds of Your Eminences, and of\r\nevery Catholic Christian, this vehement suspicion rightfully entertained\r\ntowards me, with a sincere heart and unfeigned faith, I abjure, curse,\r\nand defeat, the said errors and heresies, and generally every other\r\nerror and sect contrary to the said Holy Church; and I swear, that I\r\nwill never more in future say or assert any thing, verbally or in\r\nwriting, which may give rise to a similar suspicion of me: but if I\r\nshall know any heretic, or any one suspected of heresy, that I will\r\ndenounce him to this Holy Office, or to the Inquisitor and Ordinary of\r\nthe place in which I may be. I swear, moreover, and promise, that I will\r\nfulfil and observe fully, all the penances which have been or shall be\r\nlaid on me by this Holy Office. But if it shall happen that I violate\r\nany of my said promises, oaths, and protestations, (which God avert!) I\r\nsubject myself to all the pains and punishments which have been decreed\r\nand promulgated by the sacred canons, and other general and particular\r\nconstitutions, against delinquents of this description. So may God help\r\nme, and his Holy Gospels, which I touch with my own hands. I, the\r\nabove-named Galileo Galilei, have abjured, sworn, promised, and bound\r\nmyself, as above; and in witness thereof, with my own hand have\r\nsubscribed this present writing of my abjuration, which I have recited,\r\nword for word.\r\n\r\n\"At Rome, in the Convent of Minerva, twenty-second June, 1633, I,\r\nGalileo Galilei, have abjured as above, with my own hand.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the court Galileo was conducted to prison, to be immured for life\r\nin one of the dungeons of the Inquisition. His sentence was afterwards\r\nmitigated, and he was permitted to return to Florence; but the\r\nhumiliation to which he had been subjected pressed heavily on his\r\nspirits, beset as he was with infirmities, and totally blind, and he\r\nnever more talked or wrote on the subject of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThere was enough in the character of Galileo to command a high\r\nadmiration. There was much, also, in his sufferings in the cause of\r\nscience, to excite the deepest sympathy, and even compassion. He is\r\nmoreover universally represented to have been a man of great equanimity,\r\nand of a noble and generous disposition. No scientific character of the\r\nage, or perhaps of any age, forms a structure of finer proportions, or\r\nwears in a higher degree the grace of symmetry. Still, we cannot approve\r\nof his employing artifice in the promulgation of truth; and we are\r\ncompelled to lament that his lofty spirit bowed in the final conflict.\r\nHow far, therefore, he sinks below the dignity of the Christian martyr!\r\n\"At the age of seventy,\" says Dr. Brewster, in his life of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, \"on his bended knees, and with his right hand resting on the\r\nHoly Evangelists, did this patriarch of science avow his present and\r\npast belief in the dogmas of the Romish Church, abandon as false and\r\nheretical the doctrine of the earth's motion and of the sun's\r\nimmobility, and pledge himself to denounce to the Inquisition any other\r\nperson who was even suspected of heresy. He abjured, cursed, and\r\ndetested, those eternal and immutable truths which the Almighty had\r\npermitted him to be the first to establish. Had Galileo but added the\r\ncourage of the martyr to the wisdom of the sage; had he carried the\r\nglance of his indignant eye round the circle of his judges; had he\r\nlifted his hands to heaven, and called the living God to witness the\r\ntruth and immutability of his opinions; the bigotry of his enemies would\r\nhave been disarmed, and science would have enjoyed a memorable triumph.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nSATURN.--URANUS.--ASTEROIDS.\r\n\r\n    \"Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,\r\n    An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air.\"--_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE consideration of the system of Jupiter and his satellites led us to\r\nreview the interesting history of Galileo, who first, by means of the\r\ntelescope, disclosed the knowledge of that system to the world. I will\r\nnow proceed with the other superior planets.\r\n\r\nSaturn, as well as Jupiter, has within itself a system on a scale of\r\ngreat magnificence. In size it is next to Jupiter the largest of the\r\nplanets, being seventy-nine thousand miles in diameter, or about one\r\nthousand times as large as the earth. It has likewise belts on its\r\nsurface, and is attended by seven satellites. But a still more wonderful\r\nappendage is its _Ring_, a broad wheel, encompassing the planet at a\r\ngreat distance from it. As Saturn is nine hundred millions of miles from\r\nus, we require a more powerful telescope to see his glories, in all\r\ntheir magnificence, than we do to enjoy a full view of the system of\r\nJupiter. When we are privileged with a view of Saturn, in his most\r\nfavorable positions, through a telescope of the larger class, the\r\nmechanism appears more wonderful than even that of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nSaturn's ring, when viewed with telescopes of a high power, is found to\r\nconsist of two concentred rings, separated from each other by a dark\r\nspace. Although this division of the rings appears to us, on account of\r\nour immense distance, as only a fine line, yet it is, in reality, an\r\ninterval of not less than eighteen hundred miles. The dimensions of the\r\nwhole system are, in round numbers, as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                      Miles.\r\n    Diameter of the planet,                           79,000\r\n    From the surface of the planet to the inner ring, 20,000\r\n    Breadth of the inner ring,                        17,000\r\n    Interval between the rings,                        1,800\r\n    Breadth of the outer ring,                        10,500\r\n    Extreme dimensions from outside to outside,      176,000\r\n\r\nFigure 60, facing page 247, represents Saturn, as it appears to a\r\npowerful telescope, surrounded by its rings, and having its body striped\r\nwith dark belts, somewhat similar, but broader and less strongly marked\r\nthan those of Jupiter. In telescopes of inferior power, but still\r\nsufficient to see the ring distinctly, we should scarcely discern the\r\nbelts at all. We might, however, observe the shadow cast upon the ring\r\nby the planet, (as seen in the figure on the right, on the upper side;)\r\nand, in favorable situations of the planet, we might discern glimpses of\r\nthe shadow of the ring on the body of the planet, on the lower side\r\nbeneath the ring. To see the division of the ring and the satellites\r\nrequires a better telescope than is in possession of most observers.\r\nWith smaller telescopes, we may discover an oval figure of peculiar\r\nappearance, which it would be difficult to interpret. Galileo, who first\r\nsaw it in the year 1610, recognised this peculiarity, but did not know\r\nwhat it meant. Seeing something in the centre with two projecting arms,\r\none on each side, he concluded that the planet was triple-shaped. This\r\nwas, at the time, all he could learn respecting it, as the telescopes he\r\npossessed were very humble, compared with those now used by astronomers.\r\nThe first constructed by him magnified but three times; his second,\r\neight times; and his best, only thirty times, which is no better than a\r\ncommon ship-glass.\r\n\r\nIt was the practice of the astronomers of those days to give the first\r\nintimation of a new discovery in a Latin verse, the letters of which\r\nwere transposed. This would enable them to claim priority, in case any\r\nother person should contest the honor of the discovery, and at the same\r\ntime would afford opportunity to complete their observations, before\r\nthey published a full account of them. Accordingly, Galileo announced\r\nthe discovery of the singular appearance of Saturn under this disguise,\r\nin a line which, when the transposed letters were restored to their\r\nproper places, signified that he had observed, \"that the most distant\r\nplanet is triple-formed.\"[13] He shortly afterwards, at the request of\r\nhis patron, the Emperor Rodolph, gave the solution, and added, \"I have,\r\nwith great admiration, observed that Saturn is not a single star, but\r\nthree together, which, as it were, touch each other; they have no\r\nrelative motion, and are constituted of this form, oOo, the middle one\r\nbeing somewhat larger than the two lateral ones. If we examine them with\r\nan eyeglass which magnifies the surface less than one thousand times,\r\nthe three stars do not appear very distinctly, but Saturn has an oblong\r\nappearance, like that of an olive, thus, {oblong symbol}. Now, I have\r\ndiscovered a court for Jupiter, (alluding to his satellites,) and two\r\nservants for this old man, (Saturn,) who aid his steps, and never quit\r\nhis side.\"\r\n\r\nIt was by this mystic light that Galileo groped his way through an\r\norganization which, under the more powerful glasses of his successors,\r\nwas to expand into a mighty orb, encompassed by splendid rings of vast\r\ndimensions, the whole attended by seven bright satellites. This system\r\nwas first fully developed by Huyghens, a Dutch astronomer, about forty\r\nyears afterwards.[14] It requires a superior telescope to see it to\r\nadvantage; but, when seen through such a telescope, it is one of the\r\nmost charming spectacles afforded to that instrument. To give some idea\r\nof the properties of a telescope suited to such observations, I annex an\r\nextract from an account, that was published a few years since, of a\r\ntelescope constructed by Mr. Tully, a distinguished English artist. \"The\r\nlength of the instrument was twelve feet, but was easily adjusted, and\r\nwas perfectly steady. The magnifying powers ranged from two hundred to\r\nseven hundred and eighty times; but the great excellence of the\r\ntelescope consisted more in the superior distinctness and brilliancy\r\nwith which objects were seen through it, than in its magnifying powers.\r\nWith a power of two hundred and forty, the light of Jupiter was almost\r\nmore than the eye could bear, and his satellites appeared as bright as\r\nSirius, but with a clear and steady light; and the belts and spots on\r\nthe face of the planet were most distinctly defined. With a power of\r\nnearly four hundred, Saturn appeared large and well defined, and was one\r\nof the most beautiful objects that can well be conceived.\"\r\n\r\nThat the ring is a solid opaque substance, is shown by its throwing its\r\nshadow on the body of the planet on the side nearest the sun, and on the\r\nother side receiving that of the body. The ring encompasses the\r\nequatorial regions of the planet, and the planet revolves on an axis\r\nwhich is perpendicular to the plane of the ring in about ten and a half\r\nhours. This is known by observing the rotation of certain dusky spots,\r\nwhich sometimes appear on its surface. This motion is nearly the same\r\nwith the diurnal motion of Jupiter, subjecting places on the equator of\r\nthe planet to a very swift revolution, and occasioning a high degree of\r\ncompression at the poles, the equatorial being to the polar diameter in\r\nthe high ratio of eleven to ten.\r\n\r\nSaturn's ring, in its revolution around the sun, _always remains\r\nparallel to itself_. If we hold opposite to the eye a circular ring or\r\ndisk, like a piece of coin, it will appear as a complete circle only\r\nwhen it is at right angles to the axis of vision. When it is oblique to\r\nthat axis, it will be projected into an ellipse more and more flattened,\r\nas its obliquity is increased, until, when its plane coincides with the\r\naxis of vision, it is projected into a straight line. Please to take\r\nsome circle, as a flat plate, (whose rim may well represent the ring of\r\nSaturn,) and hold it in these different positions before the eye. Now,\r\nplace on the table a lamp to represent the sun, and holding the ring at\r\na certain distance, inclined a little towards the lamp, carry it round\r\nthe lamp, always keeping it parallel to itself. During its revolution,\r\nit will twice present its edge to the lamp at opposite points; and\r\ntwice, at places ninety degrees distant from those points, it will\r\npresent its broadest face towards the lamp. At intermediate points, it\r\nwill exhibit an ellipse more or less open, according as it is nearer one\r\nor the other of the preceding positions. It will be seen, also, that in\r\none half of the revolution, the lamp shines on one side of the ring, and\r\nin the other half of the revolution, on the other side.\r\n\r\nSuch would be the successive appearances of Saturn's ring to a spectator\r\non the sun; and since the earth is, in respect to so distant a body as\r\nSaturn, very near the sun, these appearances are presented to us nearly\r\nin the same manner as though we viewed them from the sun. Accordingly,\r\nwe sometimes see Saturn's ring under the form of a broad ellipse, which\r\ngrows continually more and more acute, until it passes into a line, and\r\nwe either lose sight of it, altogether, or, by the aid of the most\r\npowerful telescopes, we see it as a fine thread of light drawn across\r\nthe disk, and projecting out from it on each side. As the whole\r\nrevolution occupies thirty years, and the edge is presented to the sun\r\ntwice in the revolution, this last phenomenon, namely, the disappearance\r\nof the ring, takes place every fifteen years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\nYou may perhaps gain a still clearer idea of the foregoing appearances\r\nfrom the following diagram, Fig. 61. Let A, B, C, &c., represent\r\nsuccessive positions of Saturn and his ring, in different parts of his\r\norbit, while _a b_ represents the orbit of the earth. Please to remark,\r\nthat these orbits are drawn so elliptical, not to represent the\r\neccentricity of either the earth's or Saturn's orbit, but merely as the\r\nprojection of circles seen very obliquely. Also, imagine one half of the\r\nbody of the planet and of the ring to be above the plane of the paper,\r\nand the other half below it. Were the ring, when at C and G,\r\nperpendicular to C G, it would be seen by a spectator situated at _a_ or\r\n_b_ as a perfect circle; but being inclined to the line of vision\r\ntwenty-eight degrees four minutes, it is projected into an ellipse. This\r\nellipse contracts in breadth as the ring passes towards its nodes at A\r\nand E, where it dwindles into a straight line. From E to G the ring\r\nopens again, becomes broadest at G, and again contracts, till it\r\nbecomes a straight line at A, and from this point expands, till it\r\nrecovers its original breadth at C. These successive appearances are all\r\nexhibited to a telescope of moderate powers.\r\n\r\nThe ring is extremely _thin_, since the smallest satellite, when\r\nprojected on it, more than covers it. The thickness is estimated at only\r\none hundred miles. Saturn's ring shines wholly by _reflected light_\r\nderived from the sun. This is evident from the fact that that side only\r\nwhich is turned towards the sun is enlightened; and it is remarkable,\r\nthat the illumination of the ring is greater than that of the planet\r\nitself, but the outer ring is less bright than the inner. Although we\r\nview Saturn's ring nearly as though we saw it from the sun, yet the\r\nplane of the ring produced may pass between the earth and the sun, in\r\nwhich case, also, the ring becomes invisible, the illuminated side being\r\nwholly turned from us. Thus, when the ring is approaching its node at E,\r\na spectator at _a_ would have the dark side of the ring presented to\r\nhim. The ring was invisible in 1833, and will be invisible again in\r\n1847. The northern side of the ring will be in sight until 1855, when\r\nthe southern side will come into view. It appears, therefore, that there\r\nare three causes for the disappearance of Saturn's ring: first, when the\r\nedge of the ring is presented to the sun; secondly, when the edge is\r\npresented to the earth; and thirdly, when the unilluminated side is\r\ntowards the earth.\r\n\r\nSaturn's ring _revolves_ in its own plane in about ten and a half hours.\r\nLa Place inferred this from the doctrine of universal gravitation. He\r\nproved that such a rotation was necessary; otherwise, the matter of\r\nwhich the ring is composed would be precipitated upon its primary. He\r\nshowed that, in order to sustain itself, its period of rotation must be\r\nequal to the time of revolution of a satellite, circulating around\r\nSaturn at a distance from it equal to that of the middle of the ring,\r\nwhich period would be about ten and a half hours. By means of spots in\r\nthe ring, Dr. Herschel followed the ring in its rotation, and actually\r\nfound its period to be the same as assigned by La Place,--a coincidence\r\nwhich beautifully exemplifies the harmony of truth.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rings have very nearly the same centre with the planet\r\nitself, yet, recent measurements of extreme delicacy have demonstrated,\r\nthat the coincidence is not mathematically exact, but that the centre of\r\ngravity of the rings describes around that of the body a very minute\r\norbit. \"This fact,\" says Sir J. Herschel, \"unimportant as it may seem,\r\nis of the utmost consequence to the stability of the system of rings.\r\nSupposing them mathematically perfect in their circular form, and\r\nexactly concentric with the planet, it is demonstrable that they would\r\nform (in spite of their centrifugal force) a system in a state of\r\nunstable equilibrium, which the slightest external power would subvert,\r\nnot by causing a rupture in the substance of the rings, but by\r\nprecipitating them unbroken upon the surface of the planet.\" The ring\r\nmay be supposed of an unequal breadth in its different parts, and as\r\nconsisting of irregular solids, whose common centre of gravity does not\r\ncoincide with the centre of the figure. Were it not for this\r\ndistribution of matter, its equilibrium would be destroyed by the\r\nslightest force, such as the attraction of a satellite, and the ring\r\nwould finally precipitate itself upon the planet. Sir J. Herschel\r\nfurther observes, that, \"as the smallest difference of velocity between\r\nthe planet and its rings must infallibly precipitate the rings upon the\r\nplanet, never more to separate, it follows, either that their motions in\r\ntheir common orbit round the sun must have been adjusted to each other\r\nby an external power, with the minutest precision, or that the rings\r\nmust have been formed about the planet while subject to their common\r\norbitual motion, and under the full and free influence of all the acting\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\"The rings of Saturn must present a magnificent spectacle from those\r\nregions of the planet which lie on their enlightened sides, appearing\r\nas vast arches spanning the sky from horizon to horizon, and holding an\r\ninvariable situation among the stars. On the other hand, in the region\r\nbeneath the dark side, a solar eclipse of fifteen years in duration,\r\nunder their shadow, must afford (to our ideas) an inhospitable abode to\r\nanimated beings, but ill compensated by the full light of its\r\nsatellites. But we shall do wrong to judge of the fitness or unfitness\r\nof their condition, from what we see around us, when, perhaps, the very\r\ncombinations which convey to our minds only images of horror, may be in\r\nreality theatres of the most striking and glorious displays of\r\nbeneficent contrivance.\"\r\n\r\nSaturn is attended by _seven satellites_. Although they are bodies of\r\nconsiderable size, their great distance prevents their being visible to\r\nany telescope but such as afford a strong light and high magnifying\r\npowers. The outermost satellite is distant from the planet more than\r\nthirty times the planet's diameter, and is by far the largest of the\r\nwhole. It exhibits, like the satellites of Jupiter, periodic variations\r\nof light, which prove its revolution on its axis in the time of a\r\nsidereal revolution about Saturn, as is the case with our moon, while\r\nperforming its circuit about the earth. The next satellite in order,\r\nproceeding inwards, is tolerably conspicuous; the three next are very\r\nminute, and require powerful telescopes to see them; while the two\r\ninterior satellites, which just skirt the edge of the ring, and move\r\nexactly in its plane, have never been discovered but with the most\r\npowerful telescopes which human art has yet constructed, and then only\r\nunder peculiar circumstances. At the time of the disappearance of the\r\nrings, (to ordinary telescopes,) they were seen by Sir William Herschel,\r\nwith his great telescope, projected along the edge of the ring, and\r\nthreading, like beads, the thin fibre of light to which the ring is then\r\nreduced. Owing to the obliquity of the ring, and of the orbits of the\r\nsatellites, to that of their primary, there are no eclipses of the\r\nsatellites, the two interior ones excepted, until near the time when\r\nthe ring is seen edgewise.\r\n\r\n\"The firmament of Saturn will unquestionably present to view a more\r\nmagnificent and diversified scene of celestial phenomena than that of\r\nany other planet in our system. It is placed nearly in the middle of\r\nthat space which intervenes between the sun and the orbit of the\r\nremotest planet. Including its rings and satellites, it may be\r\nconsidered as the largest body or system of bodies within the limits of\r\nthe solar system; and it excels them all in the sublime and diversified\r\napparatus with which it is accompanied. In these respects, Saturn may\r\njustly be considered as the sovereign among the planetary hosts. The\r\nprominent parts of its celestial scenery may be considered as belonging\r\nto its own system of rings and satellites, and the views which will\r\noccasionally be opened of the firmament of the fixed stars; for few of\r\nthe other planets will make their appearance in its sky. Jupiter will\r\nappear alternately as a morning and an evening star, with about the same\r\ndegree of brilliancy it exhibits to us; but it will seldom be\r\nconspicuous, except near the period of its greatest elongation; and it\r\nwill never appear to remove from the sun further than thirty-seven\r\ndegrees, and consequently will not appear so conspicuous, nor for such a\r\nlength of time, as Venus does to us. Uranus is the only other planet\r\nwhich will be seen from Saturn, and it will there be distinctly\r\nperceptible, like a star of the third magnitude, when near the time of\r\nits opposition to the sun. But near the time of its conjunction it will\r\nbe completely invisible, being then eighteen hundred millions of miles\r\nmore distant than at the opposition, and eight hundred millions of miles\r\nmore distant from Saturn than it ever is from the earth at any\r\nperiod.\"[15]\r\n\r\nURANUS.--Uranus is the remotest planet belonging to our system, and is\r\nrarely visible, except to the telescope. Although his diameter is more\r\nthan four times that of the earth, being thirty-five thousand one\r\nhundred and twelve miles, yet his distance from the sun is likewise\r\nnineteen times as great as the earth's distance, or about eighteen\r\nhundred millions of miles. His revolution around the sun occupies nearly\r\neighty-four years, so that his position in the heavens, for several\r\nyears in succession, is nearly stationary. His path lies very nearly in\r\nthe ecliptic, being inclined to it less than one degree. The sun\r\nhimself, when seen from Uranus dwindles almost to a star, subtending, as\r\nit does, an angle of only one minute and forty seconds; so that the\r\nsurface of the sun would appear there four hundred times less than it\r\ndoes to us. This planet was discovered by Sir William Herschel on the\r\nthirteenth of March, 1781. His attention was attracted to it by the\r\nlargeness of its disk in the telescope; and finding that it shifted its\r\nplace among the stars, he at first took it for a comet, but soon\r\nperceived that its orbit was not eccentric, like the orbits of comets,\r\nbut nearly circular, like those of the planets. It was then recognised\r\nas a new member of the planetary system, a conclusion which has been\r\njustified by all succeeding observations. It was named by the discoverer\r\nthe _George Star_, (Georgium Sidus,) after his munificent patron, George\r\nthe Third; in the United States, and in some other countries, it was\r\ncalled _Herschel_; but the name _Uranus_, from a Greek word, (= Ouranos=,\r\n_Ouranos_,) signifying the oldest of the gods, has finally prevailed. So\r\ndistant is Uranus from the sun, that light itself, which moves nearly\r\ntwelve millions of miles every minute, would require more than two hours\r\nand a half to pass to it from the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having contemplated all the planets separately, just cast your\r\neyes on the diagram facing page 236, Fig. 53, and you will see a\r\ncomparative view of the various magnitudes of the sun, as seen from each\r\nof the planets.\r\n\r\nUranus is attended by _six satellites_. So minute objects are they, that\r\nthey can be seen only by powerful telescopes. Indeed, the existence of\r\nmore than two is still considered as somewhat doubtful. These two,\r\nhowever, offer remarkable and indeed quite unexpected and unexampled\r\npeculiarities. Contrary to the unbroken analogy of the whole planetary\r\nsystem, _the planes of their orbits are nearly perpendicular to the\r\necliptic_, and in these orbits their motions are retrograde; that is,\r\ninstead of advancing from west to east around their primary, as is the\r\ncase with all the other planets and satellites, they move in the\r\nopposite direction. With this exception, all the motions of the planets,\r\nwhether around their own axes, or around the sun, are from west to east.\r\nThe sun himself turns on his axis from west to east; all the primary\r\nplanets revolve around the sun from west to east; their revolutions on\r\ntheir own axes are also in the same direction; all the secondaries, with\r\nthe single exception above mentioned, move about their primaries from\r\nwest to east; and, finally, such of the secondaries as have been\r\ndiscovered to have a diurnal revolution, follow the same course. Such\r\nuniformity among so many motions could have resulted only from forces\r\nimpressed upon them by the same Omnipotent hand; and few things in the\r\ncreation more distinctly proclaim that God made the world.\r\n\r\nRetiring now to this furthest verge of the solar system, let us for a\r\nmoment glance at the aspect of the firmament by night. Notwithstanding\r\nwe have taken a flight of eighteen hundred millions of miles, the same\r\nstarry canopy bends over our heads; Sirius still shines with exactly the\r\nsame splendor as here; Orion, the Scorpion, the Great and the Little\r\nBear, all occupy the same stations; and the Galaxy spans the sky with\r\nthe same soft and mysterious light. The planets, however, with the\r\nexception of Saturn, are all lost to the view, being too near the sun\r\never to be seen; and Saturn himself is visible only at distant\r\nintervals, at periods of fifteen years, when at its greatest elongations\r\nfrom the sun, and is then too near the sun to permit a clear view of his\r\nrings, much less of the satellites that unite with the rings to compose\r\nhis gorgeous retinue. Comets, moving slowly as they do when so distant\r\nfrom the sun, will linger much longer in the firmament of Uranus than in\r\nours.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sun sheds by day a dim and cheerless light, yet the six\r\nsatellites that enlighten and diversify the nocturnal sky present\r\ninteresting aspects. \"Let us suppose one satellite presenting a surface\r\nin the sky eight or ten times larger than our moon; a second, five or\r\nsix times larger; a third, three times larger; a fourth, twice as large;\r\na fifth, about the same size as the moon; a sixth, somewhat smaller;\r\nand, perhaps, three or four others of different apparent dimensions: let\r\nus suppose two or three of those, of different phases, moving along the\r\nconcave of the sky, at one period four or five of them dispersed through\r\nthe heavens, one rising above the horizon, one setting, one on the\r\nmeridian, one towards the north, and another towards the south; at\r\nanother period, five or six of them displaying their lustre in the form\r\nof a half moon, or a crescent, in one quarter of the heavens; and, at\r\nanother time, the whole of these moons shining, with full enlightened\r\nhemispheres, in one glorious assemblage, and we shall have a faint idea\r\nof the beauty, variety, and sublimity of the firmament of Uranus.\"[16]\r\n\r\n_The New Planets,--Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta._--The commencement of\r\nthe present century was rendered memorable in the annals of astronomy,\r\nby the discovery of four new planets, occupying the long vacant tract\r\nbetween Mars and Jupiter. Kepler, from some analogy which he found to\r\nsubsist among the distances of the planets from the sun, had long before\r\nsuspected the existence of one at this distance; and his conjecture was\r\nrendered more probable by the discovery of Uranus, which follows the\r\nanalogy of the other planets. So strongly, indeed, were astronomers\r\nimpressed with the idea that a planet would be found between Mars and\r\nJupiter, that, in the hope of discovering it, an association was formed\r\non the continent of Europe, of twenty-four observers, who divided the\r\nsky into as many zones, one of which was allotted to each member of the\r\nassociation. The discovery of the first of these bodies was, however,\r\nmade accidentally by Piazzi, an astronomer of Palermo, on the first of\r\nJanuary, 1801. It was shortly afterwards lost sight of on account of its\r\nproximity to the sun, and was not seen again until the close of the\r\nyear, when it was re-discovered in Germany. Piazzi called it _Ceres_, in\r\nhonor of the tutelary goddess of Sicily, and her emblem, the sickle,\r\n([Planet: Ceres]) has been adopted as its appropriate symbol.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of finding Ceres induced Dr. Olbers, of Bremen, to\r\nexamine with particular care all the small stars that lie near her path,\r\nas seen from the earth; and, while prosecuting these observations, in\r\nMarch, 1802, he discovered another similar body, very nearly at the same\r\ndistance from the sun, and resembling the former in many other\r\nparticulars. The discoverer gave to this second planet the name of\r\n_Pallas_, choosing for its symbol the lance, ([Planet: Pallas]) the\r\ncharacteristic of Minerva.\r\n\r\nThe most surprising circumstance connected with the discovery of\r\n_Pallas_ was the existence of two planets at nearly the same distance\r\nfrom the sun, and apparently crossing the ecliptic in the same part of\r\nthe heavens, or having the same node. On account of this singularity,\r\nDr. Olbers was led to conjecture that Ceres and Pallas are only\r\nfragments of a larger planet, which had formerly circulated at the same\r\ndistance, and been shattered by some internal convulsion. The hypothesis\r\nsuggested the probability that there might be other fragments, whose\r\norbits might be expected to cross the ecliptic at a common point, or to\r\nhave the same node. Dr. Olbers, therefore, proposed to examine\r\ncarefully, every month, the two opposite parts of the heavens in which\r\nthe orbits of Ceres and Pallas intersect one another, with a view to the\r\ndiscovery of other planets, which might be sought for in those parts\r\nwith a greater chance of success, than in a wider zone, embracing the\r\nentire limits of these orbits. Accordingly, in 1804, near one of the\r\nnodes of Ceres and Pallas, a third planet was discovered. This was\r\ncalled _Juno_, and the character ([Planet: Juno]) was adopted for its\r\nsymbol, representing the starry sceptre of the Queen of Olympus.\r\nPursuing the same researches, in 1807 a fourth planet was discovered, to\r\nwhich was given the name of _Vesta_, and for its symbol the character\r\n([Planet: Vesta]) was chosen,--an altar surmounted with a censer holding\r\nthe sacred fire.\r\n\r\nThe _average distance_ of these bodies from the sun is two hundred and\r\nsixty-one millions of miles; and it is remarkable that their orbits are\r\nvery near together. Taking the distance of the earth from the sun for\r\nunity, their respective distances are 2.77, 2.77, 2.67, 2.37. Their\r\n_times_ of revolution around the sun are nearly equal, averaging about\r\nfour and a half years.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the _inclination of their orbits_ to the ecliptic, there\r\nis also considerable diversity. The orbit of Vesta is inclined only\r\nabout seven degrees, while that of Pallas is more than thirty-four\r\ndegrees. They all, therefore, have a higher inclination than the orbits\r\nof the old planets, and of course make excursions from the ecliptic\r\nbeyond the limits of the zodiac. Hence they have been called the\r\n_ultra-zodiacal planets_. When first discovered, before their place in\r\nthe system was fully ascertained it was also proposed to call them\r\n_asteroids_, a name implying that they were planets under the form of\r\nstars. Their title, however, to take their rank among the primary\r\nplanets, is now generally conceded.\r\n\r\nThe _eccentricity of their orbits_ is also, in general, greater than\r\nthat of the old planets. You will recollect that this language denotes\r\nthat their orbits are more elliptical, or depart further from the\r\ncircular form. The eccentricities of the orbits of Pallas and Juno\r\nexceed that of the orbit of Mercury. The asteroids differ so much,\r\nhowever, in eccentricity, that their orbits may cross each other. The\r\norbits of the old planets are so nearly circular, and at such a great\r\ndistance apart, that there is no danger of their interfering with each\r\nother. The earth, for example, when at its nearest distance from the\r\nsun, will never come so near it as Venus is when at its greatest\r\ndistance, and therefore can never cross the orbit of Venus. But since\r\nthe average distance of Ceres and Pallas from the sun is about the same,\r\nwhile the eccentricity of the orbit of Pallas is much greater than that\r\nof Ceres, consequently, Pallas may come so near to the sun at its\r\nperihelion, as to cross the orbit of Ceres.\r\n\r\nThe _small size_ of the asteroids constitutes one of their most\r\nremarkable peculiarities. The difficulty of estimating the apparent\r\ndiameter of bodies at once so very small and so far off, would lead us\r\nto expect different results in the actual estimates. Accordingly, while\r\nDr. Herschel estimates the diameter of Pallas at only eighty miles,\r\nSchroeter places it as high as two thousand miles, or about the diameter\r\nof the moon. The volume of Vesta is estimated at only one fifteen\r\nthousandth part of the earth's, and her surface is only about equal to\r\nthat of the kingdom of Spain.\r\n\r\nThese little bodies are surrounded by _atmospheres_ of great extent,\r\nsome of which are uncommonly luminous, and others appear to consist of\r\nnebulous matter, like that of comets. These planets shine with a more\r\nvivid light than might be expected, from their great distance and\r\ndiminutive size; but a good telescope is essential for obtaining a\r\ndistinct view of their phenomena.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great chasm which occurs between Mars and Jupiter,--a chasm\r\nof more than three hundred millions of miles,--suggested long ago the\r\nidea of other planetary bodies occupying that part of the solar system,\r\nyet the discovery of the asteroids does not entirely satisfy expectation\r\nsince they are bodies so dissimilar to the other members of the series\r\nin size, in appearance, and in the form and inclinations of their\r\norbits. Hence, Dr. Olbers, the discoverer of three of these bodies, held\r\nthat they were fragments of a single large planet, which once occupied\r\nthat place in the system, and which exploded in different directions by\r\nsome internal violence. Of the fragments thus projected into space, some\r\nwould be propelled in such directions and with such velocities, as,\r\nunder the force of projection and that of the solar attraction would\r\nmake them revolve in regular orbits around the sun. Others would be so\r\nprojected among the other bodies in the system, as to be thrown in very\r\nirregular orbits, apparently wandering lawless through the skies. The\r\nlarger fragments would receive the least impetus from the explosive\r\nforce, and would therefore circulate in an orbit deviating less than any\r\nother of the fragments from the original path of the large planet; while\r\nthe lesser fragments, being thrown off with greater velocity, would\r\nrevolve in orbits more eccentric, and more inclined to the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nDr. Brewster, editor of the 'Edinburgh Encyclopedia,' and the well-known\r\nauthor of various philosophical works, espoused this hypothesis with\r\nmuch zeal; and, after summing up the evidence in favor of it, he remarks\r\nas follows: \"These singular resemblances in the motions of the greater\r\nfragments, and in those of the lesser fragments, and the striking\r\ncoincidences between theory and observation in the eccentricity of their\r\norbits, in their inclination to the ecliptic, in the position of their\r\nnodes, and in the places of their perihelia, are phenomena which could\r\nnot possibly result from chance, and which concur to prove, with an\r\nevidence amounting almost to demonstration, that the four new planets\r\nhave diverged from one common node, and have therefore composed a single\r\nplanet.\"\r\n\r\nThe same distinguished writer supposes that some of the smallest\r\nfragments might even have come within reach of the earth's attraction,\r\nand by the combined effects of their projectile forces and the\r\nattraction of the earth, be made to revolve around this body as the\r\nlarger fragments are carried around the sun; and that these are in fact\r\nthe bodies which afford those _meteoric stones_ which are\r\noccasionally precipitated to the earth. It is now a well-ascertained\r\nfact, a fact which has been many times verified in our own country, that\r\nlarge meteors, in the shape of fire-balls, traversing the atmosphere,\r\nsometimes project to the earth masses of stony or ferruginous matter.\r\nSuch were the meteoric stones which fell at Weston, in Connecticut, in\r\n1807, of which a full and interesting account was published, after a\r\nminute examination of the facts, by Professors Silliman and Kingsley, of\r\nYale College. Various accounts of similar occurrences may be found in\r\ndifferent volumes of the American Journal of Science. It is for the\r\nproduction of these wonderful phenomena that Dr. Brewster supposes the\r\nexplosion of the planet, which, according to Dr. Olbers, produced the\r\nasteroids, accounts. Others, however, as Sir John Herschel, have been\r\ndisposed to ascribe very little weight to the doctrine of Olbers.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi.

We should see all the planets coursing each other from west to\r\neast, through the same great highway, (the Zodiac,) no one of them, with\r\nthe exception of the asteroids, deviating more than seven degrees from\r\nthe path pursued by the earth. Most of them, indeed, would always be\r\nseen moving much nearer than that to the ecliptic. We should see the\r\nplanets moving on their way with various degrees of speed. Mercury would\r\nmake the entire circuit in about three months, hurrying on his course\r\nwith a speed about one third as great as that by which the moon revolves\r\naround the earth. The most distant planets, on the other hand, move at\r\nso slow a pace, that we should see Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars,\r\nseverally overtaking them a great many times, before they had completed\r\ntheir revolutions. But though the movements of some were comparatively\r\nrapid, and of others extremely slow, yet they would not seem to differ\r\nmaterially, in other respects: each would be making a steady and nearly\r\nuniform march along the celestial vault.\r\n\r\nSuch would be the simple and harmonious motions of the planets, as they\r\nwould be seen from the sun, the centre of their motions; and such they\r\nare, in fact. But two circumstances conspire to make them appear\r\nexceedingly different from these, and vastly more complicated; one is,\r\nthat we view them out of the centre of their motions; the other, that we\r\nare ourselves in motion. I have already explained to you the effect\r\nwhich these two causes produce on the apparent motions of the inferior\r\nplanets, Mercury and Venus. Let us now see how they effect those of the\r\nsuperior planets, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.\r\n\r\nOrreries, or machines intended to exhibit a model of the solar system,\r\nare sometimes employed to give a popular view of the planetary motions;\r\nbut they oftener mislead than give correct ideas. They may assist\r\nreflection, but they can never supply its place. The impossibility of\r\nrepresenting things in their just proportions will be evident, when we\r\nreflect that, to do this, if in an orrery we make Mercury as large as a\r\ncherry, we should have to represent the sun six feet in diameter. If we\r\npreserve the same proportions, in regard to distance, we must place\r\nMercury two hundred and fifty feet, and Uranus twelve thousand five\r\nhundred feet, or more than two miles from the sun. The mind of the\r\nstudent of astronomy must, therefore, raise itself from such imperfect\r\nrepresentations of celestial phenomena, as are afforded by artificial\r\nmechanism, and, transferring his contemplations to the celestial regions\r\nthemselves, he must conceive of the sun and planets as bodies that bear\r\nan insignificant ratio to the immense spaces in which they circulate,\r\nresembling more a few little birds flying in the open sky, than they do\r\nthe crowded machinery of an orrery.\r\n\r\nThe _real_ motions of the planets, indeed, or such as orreries usually\r\nexhibit, are very easily conceived of, as before explained; but the\r\n_apparent_ motions are, for the most part, entirely different from\r\nthese. The apparent motions of the inferior planets have been already\r\nexplained. You will recollect that Mercury and Venus move backwards and\r\nforwards across the sun, the former never being seen further than\r\ntwenty-nine degrees, and the latter never more than about forty-seven\r\ndegrees, from that luminary; that, while passing from the greatest\r\nelongation on one side, to the greatest elongation on the other side,\r\nthrough the superior conjunction, the apparent motions of these planets\r\nare accelerated by the motion of the earth; but that, while moving\r\nthrough the inferior conjunction, at which time their motions are\r\nretrograde, they are apparently retarded by the earth's motion. Let us\r\nnow see what are the apparent motions of the superior planets.\r\n\r\nLet A, B, C, Fig. 62, page 294, represent the earth in different\r\npositions in its orbit, M, a superior planet, as Mars, and N R, an arc\r\nof the concave sphere of the heavens. First, suppose the planet to\r\nremain at rest in M, and let us see what apparent motions it will\r\nreceive from the real motions of the earth. When the earth is at B, it\r\nwill see the planet in the heavens at N; and as the earth moves\r\nsuccessively through C, D, E, F, the planet will appear to move through\r\nO, P, Q, R. B and F are the two points of greatest elongation of the\r\nearth from the sun, as seen from the planet; hence, between these two\r\npoints, while passing through its orbit most remote from the planet,\r\n(when the planet is seen in superior conjunction,) the earth, by its own\r\nmotion, gives an apparent motion to the planet in the order of the\r\nsigns; that is, the _apparent_ motion given by the _real_ motion of the\r\nearth is _direct_. But in passing from F to B through A, when the planet\r\nis seen in opposition, the apparent motion given to the planet by the\r\nearth's motion is from R to N, and is therefore _retrograde_. As the arc\r\ndescribed by the earth, when the motion is direct, is much greater than\r\nwhen the motion is retrograde, while the apparent arc of the heavens\r\ndescribed by the planet from N to R, in the one case, and from R to N,\r\nin the other, is the same in both cases, the retrograde motion is much\r\nswifter than the direct, being performed in much less time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 62.]\r\n\r\nBut the superior planets are not in fact at rest, as we have supposed,\r\nbut are all the while moving eastward, though with a slower motion than\r\nthe earth. Indeed, with respect to the remotest planets, as Saturn and\r\nUranus, the forward motion is so exceedingly slow, that the above\r\nrepresentation is nearly true for a single year. Still, the effect of\r\nthe real motions of all the superior planets, eastward, is to increase\r\nthe direct apparent motion communicated by the earth, and to diminish\r\nthe retrograde motion. This will be evident from inspecting the figure;\r\nfor if the planet _actually_ moves eastward while it is _apparently_\r\ncarried eastward by the earth's motion, the whole motion eastward will\r\nbe equal to the sum of the two; and if, while it is really moving\r\neastward, it is apparently carried westward still more by the earth's\r\nmotion, the retrograde movement will equal the difference of the two.\r\n\r\nIf Mars stood still while the earth went round the sun, then a second\r\nopposition, as at A, would occur at the end of one year from the first;\r\nbut, while the earth is performing this circuit, Mars is also moving the\r\nsame way, more than half as fast; so that, when the earth returns to A,\r\nthe planet has already performed more than half the same circuit, and\r\nwill have completed its whole revolution before the earth comes up with\r\nit. Indeed Mars, after having been seen once in opposition, does not\r\ncome into opposition again until after two years and fifty days. And\r\nsince the planet is then comparatively near to us, as at M, while the\r\nearth is at A, and appears very large and bright, rising unexpectedly\r\nabout the time the sun sets, he surprises the world as though it were\r\nsome new celestial body. But on account of the slow progress of Saturn\r\nand Uranus, we find, after having performed one circuit around the sun,\r\nthat they are but little advanced beyond where we left them at the last\r\nopposition. The time between one opposition of Saturn and another is\r\nonly a year and thirteen days.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the superior planets steadily pursue their\r\ncourse around the sun, but that their apparent retrograde motion, when\r\nin opposition, is occasioned by our passing by them with a swifter\r\nmotion, of which we are unconscious, like the apparent backward motion\r\nof a vessel, when we overtake it and pass by it rapidly in a steam-boat.\r\n\r\nSuch are the real and the apparent motions of the planets. Let us now\r\nturn our attention to the _laws of the planetary orbits_.\r\n\r\nThere are three great principles, according to which the motions of the\r\nearth and all the planets around the sun are regulated, called KEPLER'S\r\nLAWS, having been first discovered by the astronomer whose name they\r\nbear. They may appear to you, at first, dry and obscure; yet they will\r\nbe easily understood from the explanations which follow; and so\r\nimportant have they proved in astronomical inquiries, that they have\r\nacquired for their renowned discoverer the appellation of the\r\n'_Legislator of the Skies_.' We will consider each of these laws\r\nseparately; and, for the sake of rendering the explanation clear and\r\nintelligible, I shall perhaps repeat some things that have been briefly\r\nmentioned before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 63.]\r\n\r\nFIRST LAW.--_The orbits of the earth and all the planets are ellipses,\r\nhaving the sun in the common focus._ In a circle, all the diameters are\r\nequal to one another; but if we take a metallic wire or hoop, and draw\r\nit out on opposite sides, we elongate it into an ellipse, of which the\r\ndifferent diameters are very unequal. That which connects the points\r\nmost distant from each other is called the _transverse_, and that which\r\nis at right angles to this is called the _conjugate_, axis. Thus, A B,\r\nFig. 63, is the transverse axis, and C D, the conjugate of the ellipse A\r\nB C. By such a process of elongating the circle into an ellipse, the\r\ncentre of the circle may be conceived of as drawn opposite ways to E and\r\nF, each of which becomes a _focus_, and both together are called the\r\n_foci_ of the ellipse. The distance G E, or G F, of the focus from the\r\ncentre is called the _eccentricity_ of the ellipse; and the ellipse is\r\nsaid to be more or less eccentric, as the distance of the focus from the\r\ncentre is greater or less. Figure 64 represents such a collection of\r\nellipses around the common focus F, the innermost, A G D, having a small\r\neccentricity, or varying little from a circle, while the outermost, A C\r\nB, is an eccentric ellipse. The orbits of all the bodies that revolve\r\nabout the sun, both planets and comets, have, in like manner, a common\r\nfocus, in which the sun is situated, but they differ in eccentricity.\r\nMost of the planets have orbits of very little eccentricity, differing\r\nlittle from circles, but comets move in very eccentric ellipses. The\r\nearth's path around the sun varies so little from a circle, that a\r\ndiagram representing it truly would scarcely be distinguished from a\r\nperfect circle; yet, when the comparative distances of the sun from the\r\nearth are taken at different seasons of the year, we find that the\r\ndifference between their greatest and least distances is no less than\r\nthree millions of miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 64.]\r\n\r\nSECOND LAW.--_The radius vector of the earth, or of any planet,\r\ndescribes equal areas in equal times._ You will recollect that the\r\nradius vector is a line drawn from the centre of the sun to a planet\r\nrevolving about the sun. This definition I have somewhere given you\r\nbefore, and perhaps it may appear to you like needless repetition to\r\nstate it again. In a book designed for systematic instruction, where all\r\nthe articles are distinctly numbered, it is commonly sufficient to make\r\na reference back to the article where the point in question is\r\nexplained; but I think, in Letters like these, you will bear with a\r\nlittle repetition, rather than be at the trouble of turning to the Index\r\nand hunting up a definition long since given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 65. ]\r\n\r\nIn Figure 65, _E a_, _E b_, _E c_, &c., are successive representations\r\nof the radius vector. Now, if a planet sets out from _a_, and travels\r\nround the sun in the direction of _a b c_, it will move faster when\r\nnearer the sun, as at _a_, than when more remote from it, as at _m_;\r\nyet, if _a b_ and _m n_ be arcs described in equal times, then,\r\naccording to the foregoing law, the space _E a b_ will be equal to the\r\nspace _E m n_; and the same is true of all the other spaces described in\r\nequal times. Although the figure _E a b_ is much shorter than _E m n_,\r\nyet its greater breadth exactly counterbalances the greater length of\r\nthose figures which are described by the radius vector where it is\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nTHIRD LAW.--_The squares of the periodical times are as the cubes of the\r\nmean distances from the sun._ The periodical time of a body is the time\r\nit takes to complete its orbit, in its revolution about the sun. Thus\r\nthe earth's periodic time is one year, and that of the planet Jupiter\r\nabout twelve years. As Jupiter takes so much longer time to travel round\r\nthe sun than the earth does, we might suspect that his orbit is larger\r\nthan that of the earth, and of course, that he is at a greater distance\r\nfrom the sun; and our first thought might be, that he is probably twelve\r\ntimes as far off; but Kepler discovered that the distance does not\r\nincrease as fast as the times increase, but that the planets which are\r\nmore distant from the sun actually move slower than those which are\r\nnearer. After trying a great many proportions, he at length found that,\r\nif we take the squares of the periodic times of two planets, the greater\r\nsquare contains the less, just as often as the cube of the distance of\r\nthe greater contains that of the less. This fact is expressed by saying,\r\nthat the squares of the periodic times are to one another as the cubes\r\nof the distances.\r\n\r\nThis law is of great use in determining the distance of the planets from\r\nthe sun. Suppose, for example, that we wish to find the distance of\r\nJupiter. We can easily determine, from observation, what is Jupiter's\r\nperiodical time, for we can actually see how long it takes for Jupiter,\r\nafter leaving a certain part of the heavens to come round to the same\r\npart again. Let this period be twelve years. The earth's period is of\r\ncourse one year; and the distance of the earth, as determined from the\r\nsun's horizontal parallax, as already explained, is about ninety-five\r\nmillions of miles. Now, we have here three terms of a proportion to find\r\nthe fourth, and therefore the solution is merely a simple case of the\r\nrule of three. Thus:--the square of 1 year : square of 12 years :: cube\r\nof 95,000,000 : cube of Jupiter's distance. The three first terms being\r\nknown, we have only to multiply together the second and third and divide\r\nby the first, to obtain the fourth term, which will give us the cube of\r\nJupiter's distance from the sun; and by extracting the cube root of this\r\nsum, we obtain the distance itself. In the same manner we may obtain the\r\nrespective distances of all the other planets.\r\n\r\nSo truly is this a law of the solar system, that it holds good in\r\nrespect to the new planets, which have been discovered since Kepler's\r\ntime, as well as in the case of the old planets. It also holds good in\r\nrespect to comets, and to all bodies belonging to the solar system,\r\nwhich revolve around the sun as their centre of motion. Hence, it is\r\njustly regarded as one of the most interesting and important principles\r\nyet developed in astronomy.\r\n\r\nBut who was this Kepler, that gained such an extraordinary insight into\r\nthe laws of the planetary system, as to be called the 'Legislator of the\r\nSkies?' John Kepler was one of the most remarkable of the human race,\r\nand I think I cannot gratify or instruct you more, than by occupying the\r\nremainder of this Letter with some particulars of his history.\r\n\r\nKepler was a native of Germany. He was born in the Duchy of Wurtemberg,\r\nin 1571. As Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton, are\r\nnames that are much associated in the history of astronomy, let us see\r\nhow they stood related to each other in point of time. Copernicus was\r\nborn in 1473; Tycho, in 1546; Galileo, in 1564; Kepler, in 1571; and\r\nNewton, in 1642. Hence, Copernicus was seventy-three years before\r\nTycho, and Tycho ninety-six years before Newton. They all lived to an\r\nadvanced age, so that Tycho, Galileo, and Kepler, were contemporary for\r\nmany years; and Newton, as I mentioned in the sketch I gave you of his\r\nlife, was born the year that Galileo died.\r\n\r\nKepler was born of parents who were then in humble circumstances,\r\nalthough of noble descent. Their misfortunes, which had reduced them to\r\npoverty, seem to have been aggravated by their own unhappy dispositions;\r\nfor his biographer informs us, that \"his mother was treated with a\r\ndegree of barbarity by her husband and brother-in-law, that was hardly\r\nexceeded by her own perverseness.\" It is fortunate, therefore, that\r\nKepler, in his childhood, was removed from the immediate society and\r\nexample of his parents, and educated at a public school at the expense\r\nof the Duke of Wurtemberg. He early imbibed a taste for natural\r\nphilosophy, but had conceived a strong prejudice against astronomy, and\r\neven a contempt for it, inspired, probably, by the arrogant and\r\nridiculous pretensions of the astrologers, who constituted the principal\r\nastronomers of his country. A vacant post, however, of teacher of\r\nastronomy, occurred when he was of a suitable age to fill it, and he was\r\ncompelled to take it by the authority of his tutors, though with many\r\nprotestations, on his part, wishing to be provided for in some other\r\nmore brilliant profession.\r\n\r\nHappy is genius, when it lights on a profession entirely consonant to\r\nits powers, where the objects successively presented to it are so\r\nexactly suited to its nature, that it clings to them as the loadstone to\r\nits kindred metal among piles of foreign ores. Nothing could have been\r\nmore congenial to the very mental constitution of Kepler, than the study\r\nof astronomy,--a science where the most capacious understanding may find\r\nscope in unison with the most fervid imagination.\r\n\r\nMuch as has been said against hypotheses in philosophy, it is\r\nnevertheless a fact, that some of the greatest truths have been\r\ndiscovered in the pursuit of hypotheses, in themselves entirely false;\r\ntruths, moreover, far more important than those assumed by the\r\nhypotheses; as Columbus, in searching for a northwest passage to India,\r\ndiscovered a new world. Thus Kepler groped his way through many false\r\nand absurd suppositions, to some of the most sublime discoveries ever\r\nmade by man. The fundamental principle which guided him was not,\r\nhowever, either false or absurd. It was, that God, who made the world,\r\nhad established, throughout all his works, fixed laws,--laws that are\r\noften so definite as to be capable of expression in exact numerical\r\nterms. In accordance with these views, he sought for numerical relations\r\nin the disposition and arrangement of the planets, in respect to their\r\nnumber, the times of their revolution, and their distances from one\r\nanother. Many, indeed, of the subordinate suppositions which he made,\r\nwere extremely fanciful; but he tried his own hypotheses by a rigorous\r\nmathematical test, wherever he could apply it; and as soon as he\r\ndiscovered that a supposition would not abide this test, he abandoned it\r\nwithout the least hesitation, and adopted others, which he submitted to\r\nthe same severe trial, to share, perhaps, the same fate. \"After many\r\nfailures,\" he says, \"I was comforted by observing that the motions, in\r\nevery case, seemed to be connected with the distances; and that, when\r\nthere was a great gap between the orbits, there was the same between the\r\nmotions. And I reasoned that, if God had adapted motions to the orbits\r\nin some relation to the distances, he had also arranged the distances\r\nthemselves in relation to something else.\"\r\n\r\nIn two years after he commenced the study of astronomy, he published a\r\nbook, called the '_Mysterium Cosmographicum_,' a name which implies an\r\nexplanation of the mysteries involved in the construction of the\r\nuniverse. This work was full of the wildest speculations and most\r\nextravagant hypotheses, the most remarkable of which was, that the\r\ndistances of the planets from the sun are regulated by the relations\r\nwhich subsist between the five regular solids. It is well known to\r\ngeometers, that there are and can be only five _regular solids_. These\r\nare, first, the _tetraedron_, a four-sided figure, all whose sides are\r\nequal and similar triangles; secondly, the _cube_, contained by six\r\nequal squares; thirdly, an _octaedron_, an eight-sided figure,\r\nconsisting of two four-sided pyramids joined at their bases; fourthly, a\r\n_dodecaedron_, having twelve five-sided or pentagonal faces; and,\r\nfifthly, an _icosaedron_, contained by twenty equal and similar\r\ntriangles. You will be much at a loss, I think, to imagine what relation\r\nKepler could trace between these strange figures and the distances of\r\nthe several planets from the sun. He thought he discovered a connexion\r\nbetween those distances and the spaces which figures of this kind would\r\noccupy, if interposed in certain ways between them. Thus, he says the\r\nEarth is a circle, the measure of all; round it describe a dodecaedron,\r\nand the circle including this will be the orbit of Mars. Round this\r\ncircle describe a tetraedron, and the circle including this will be the\r\norbit of Jupiter. Describe a cube round this, and the circle including\r\nit will be the orbit of Saturn. Now, inscribe in the earth an\r\nicosaedron, and the circle included in this will give the orbit of\r\nVenus. In this inscribe an octaedron, and the circle included in this\r\nwill be the orbit of Mercury. On this supposed discovery Kepler exults\r\nin the most enthusiastic expressions. \"The intense pleasure I have\r\nreceived from this discovery never can be told in words. I regretted no\r\nmore time wasted; I tired of no labor; I shunned no toil of reckoning;\r\ndays and nights I spent in calculations, until I could see whether this\r\nopinion would agree with the orbits of Copernicus, or whether my joy was\r\nto vanish into air. I willingly subjoin that sentiment of Archytas, as\r\ngiven by Cicero; 'If I could mount up into heaven, and thoroughly\r\nperceive the nature of the world and the beauty of the stars, that\r\nadmiration would be without a charm for me, unless I had some one like\r\nyou, reader, candid, attentive, and eager for knowledge, to whom to\r\ndescribe it.' If you acknowledge this feeling, and are candid, you will\r\nrefrain from blame, such as, not without cause, I anticipate; but if,\r\nleaving that to itself, you fear, lest these things be not ascertained,\r\nand that I have shouted triumph before victory, at least approach these\r\npages, and learn the matter in consideration: you will not find, as just\r\nnow, new and unknown planets interposed; that boldness of mine is not\r\napproved; but those old ones very little loosened, and so furnished by\r\nthe interposition (however absurd you may think it) of rectilinear\r\nfigures, that in future you may give a reason to the rustics, when they\r\nask for the hooks which keep the skies from falling.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Tycho Brahe, who had then retired from his famous Uraniburg, and\r\nwas settled in Prague, met with this work of Kepler's, he immediately\r\nrecognised under this fantastic garb the lineaments of a great\r\nastronomer. He needed such an unwearied and patient calculator as he\r\nperceived Kepler to be, to aid him in his labors, in order that he might\r\ndevote himself more unreservedly to the taking of observations,--an\r\nemployment in which he delighted, and in which, as I mentioned, in\r\ngiving you a sketch of his history, he excelled all men of that and\r\npreceding ages. Kepler, therefore, at the express invitation of Tycho,\r\nwent to Prague, and joined him in the capacity of assistant. Had Tycho\r\nbeen of a nature less truly noble, he might have looked with contempt on\r\none who had made so few observations, and indulged so much in wild\r\nspeculation; or he might have been jealous of a rising genius, in which\r\nhe descried so many signs of future eminence as an astronomer; but,\r\nsuperior to all the baser motives, he extends to the young aspirant the\r\nhand of encouragement, in the following kind invitation: \"Come not as a\r\nstranger, but as a very welcome friend; come, and share in my\r\nobservations, with such instruments as I have with me.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral years previous to this, Kepler, after one or two unsuccessful\r\ntrials, had found him a wife, from whom he expected a considerable\r\nfortune; but in this he was disappointed; and so poor was he, that, when\r\non his journey to Prague, in company with his wife, being taken sick, he\r\nwas unable to defray the expenses of the journey, and was forced to cast\r\nhimself on the bounty of Tycho.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the following year, while absent from Prague, he\r\nfancied that Tycho had injured him, and accordingly addressed to the\r\nnoble Dane a letter full of insults and reproaches. A mild reply from\r\nTycho opened the eyes of Kepler to his own ingratitude. His better\r\nfeelings soon returned, and he sent to his great patron this humble\r\napology: \"Most noble Tycho! How shall I enumerate, or rightly estimate,\r\nyour benefits conferred on me! For two months you have liberally and\r\ngratuitously maintained me, and my whole family; you have provided for\r\nall my wishes; you have done me every possible kindness; you have\r\ncommunicated to me every thing you hold most dear; no one, by word or\r\ndeed, has intentionally injured me in any thing; in short, not to your\r\nown children, your wife, or yourself, have you shown more indulgence\r\nthan to me. This being so, as I am anxious to put upon record, I cannot\r\nreflect, without consternation, that I should have been so given up by\r\nGod to my own intemperance, as to shut my eyes on all these benefits;\r\nthat, instead of modest and respectful gratitude, I should indulge for\r\nthree weeks in continual moroseness towards all your family, and in\r\nheadlong passion and the utmost insolence towards yourself, who possess\r\nso many claims on my veneration, from your noble family, your\r\nextraordinary learning, and distinguished reputation. Whatever I have\r\nsaid or written against the person, the fame, the honor, and the\r\nlearning, of your Excellency; or whatever, in any other way, I have\r\ninjuriously spoken or written, (if they admit no other more favorable\r\ninterpretation,) as to my grief I have spoken and written many things,\r\nand more than I can remember; all and every thing I recant, and freely\r\nand honestly declare and profess to be groundless, false, and incapable\r\nof proof.\" This was ample satisfaction to the generous Tycho.\r\n\r\n    \"To err is human: to forgive, divine.\"\r\n\r\nOn Kepler's return to Prague, he was presented to the Emperor by Tycho,\r\nand honored with the title of Imperial Mathematician. This was in 1601,\r\nwhen he was thirty years of age. Tycho died shortly after, and Kepler\r\nsucceeded him as principal mathematician to the Emperor; but his salary\r\nwas badly paid, and he suffered much from pecuniary embarrassments.\r\nAlthough he held the astrologers, or those who told fortunes by the\r\nstars, in great contempt, yet he entertained notions of his own, on the\r\nsame subject, quite as extravagant, and practised the art of casting\r\nnativities, to eke out a support for his family.\r\n\r\nWhen Galileo began to observe with his telescope, and announced, in\r\nrapid succession, his wonderful discoveries, Kepler entered into them\r\nwith his characteristic enthusiasm, although they subverted many of his\r\nfavorite hypotheses. But such was his love of truth, that he was among\r\nthe first to congratulate Galileo, and a most engaging correspondence\r\nwas carried on between these master-spirits.\r\n\r\nThe first planet, which occupied the particular attention of Kepler, was\r\nMars, the long and assiduous study of whose motions conducted him at\r\nlength to the discovery of those great principles called 'Kepler's\r\nLaws.' Rarely do we meet with so remarkable a union of a vivid fancy\r\nwith a profound intellect. The hasty and extravagant suggestions of the\r\nformer were submitted to the most laborious calculations, some of which,\r\nthat were of great length, he repeated seventy times. This exuberance of\r\nfancy frequently appears in his style of writing, which occasionally\r\nassumes a tone ludicrously figurative. He seems constantly to\r\ncontemplate Mars as a valiant hero, who had hitherto proved invincible,\r\nand who would often elude his own efforts to conquer him, \"While thus\r\ntriumphing over Mars, and preparing for him, as for one altogether\r\nvanquished, tabular prisons, and equated, eccentric fetters, it is\r\nbuzzed here and there, that the victory is vain, and that the war is\r\nraging anew as violently as before. For the enemy, left at home a\r\ndespised captive, has burst all the chains of the equation, and broken\r\nforth of the prisons of the tables. Skirmishes routed my forces of\r\nphysical causes, and, shaking off the yoke, regained their liberty. And\r\nnow, there was little to prevent the fugitive enemy from effecting a\r\njunction with his own rebellious supporters, and reducing me to despair,\r\nhad I not suddenly sent into the field a reserve of new physical\r\nreasonings, on the rout and dispersion of the veterans, and diligently\r\nfollowed, without allowing the slightest respite, in the direction in\r\nwhich he had broken out.\"\r\n\r\nBut he pursued this warfare with the planet until he gained a full\r\nconquest, by the discovery of the first two of his laws, namely, that\r\n_he revolves in an elliptical orbit_, and that _his radius vector passes\r\nover equal spaces in equal times_.\r\n\r\nDomestic troubles, however, involved him in the deepest affliction.\r\nPoverty, the loss of a promising and favorite son, the death of his\r\nwife, after a long illness;--these were some of the misfortunes that\r\nclustered around him. Although his first marriage had been an unhappy\r\none, it was not consonant to his genius to surrender any thing with only\r\na single trial. Accordingly, it was not long before he endeavored to\r\nrepair his loss by a second alliance. He commissioned a number of his\r\nfriends to look out for him, and he soon obtained a tabular list of\r\neleven ladies, among whom his affections wavered. The progress of his\r\ncourtship is thus narrated in the interesting 'Life' contained in the\r\n'Library of Useful Knowledge.' It furnishes so fine a specimen of his\r\neccentricities, that I cannot deny myself the pleasure of transcribing\r\nthe passage for your perusal. It is taken from an account which Kepler\r\nhimself gave in a letter to a friend.\r\n\r\n\"The first on the list was a widow, an intimate friend of his first wife\r\nand who, on many accounts, appeared a most eligible match. At first, she\r\nseemed favorably inclined to the proposal: it is certain that she took\r\ntime to consider it, but at last she very quietly excused herself.\r\nFinding her afterwards less agreeable in person than he had anticipated,\r\nhe considered it a fortunate escape, mentioning, among other objections,\r\nthat she had two marriageable daughters, whom, by the way, he had got on\r\nhis list for examination. He was much troubled to reconcile his\r\nastrology with the fact of his having taken so much pains about a\r\nnegotiation not destined to succeed. He examined the case\r\nprofessionally. 'Have the stars,' says he, 'exercised any influence\r\nhere? For, just about this time, the direction of the mid-heaven is in\r\nhot opposition to Mars, and the passage of Saturn through the ascending\r\npoint of the zodiac, in the scheme of my nativity, will happen again\r\nnext November and December. But, if these are the causes, how do they\r\nact? Is that explanation the true one, which I have elsewhere given? For\r\nI can never think of handing over to the stars the office of deities, to\r\nproduce effects. Let us, therefore, suppose it accounted for by the\r\nstars, that at this season I am violent in my temper and affections, in\r\nrashness of belief, in a show of pitiful tender-heartedness, in catching\r\nat reputation by new and paradoxical notions, and the singularity of my\r\nactions; in busily inquiring into, and weighing, and discussing, various\r\nreasons; in the uneasiness of my mind, with respect to my choice. I\r\nthank God, that that did not happen which might have happened; that this\r\nmarriage did not take place. Now for the others.' Of these, one was too\r\nold; another, in bad health; another, too proud of her birth and\r\nquarterings; a fourth had learned nothing but showy accomplishments, not\r\nat all suitable to the kind of life she would have to lead with him.\r\nAnother grew impatient, and married a more decided admirer while he was\r\nhesitating. 'The mischief,' says he, 'in all these attachments was,\r\nthat, whilst I was delaying, comparing, and balancing, conflicting\r\nreasons, every day saw me inflamed with a new passion.' By the time he\r\nreached No. 8, of his list, he found his match in this respect. 'Fortune\r\nhas avenged herself at length on my doubtful inclinations. At first, she\r\nwas quite complying, and her friends also. Presently, whether she did or\r\ndid not consent, not only I, but she herself, did not know. After the\r\nlapse of a few days, came a renewed promise, which, however, had to be\r\nconfirmed a third time: and, four days after that, she again repented\r\nher conformation, and begged to be excused from it. Upon this, I gave\r\nher up, and this time all my counsellors were of one opinion.' This was\r\nthe longest courtship in the list, having lasted three whole months;\r\nand, quite disheartened by its bad success, Kepler's next attempt was of\r\na more timid complexion. His advances to No. 9 were made by confiding to\r\nher the whole story of his recent disappointment, prudently determining\r\nto be guided in his behavior, by observing whether the treatment he\r\nexperienced met with a proper degree of sympathy. Apparently, the\r\nexperiment did not succeed; and, when almost reduced to despair, Kepler\r\nbetook himself to the advice of a friend, who had for some time past\r\ncomplained that she was not consulted in this difficult negotiation.\r\nWhen she produced No. 10, and the first visit was paid, the report upon\r\nher was as follows: 'She has, undoubtedly, a good fortune, is of good\r\nfamily, and of economical habits: but her physiognomy is most horribly\r\nugly; she would be stared at in the streets, not to mention the striking\r\ndisproportion in our figures. I am lank, lean, and spare; she is short\r\nand thick. In a family notorious for fatness, she is considered\r\nsuperfluously fat.' The only objection to No. 11 seems to have been, her\r\nexcessive youth; and when this treaty was broken off, on that account,\r\nKepler turned his back upon all his advisers, and chose for himself one\r\nwho had figured as No. 5, in his list, to whom he professes to have felt\r\nattached throughout, but from whom the representations of his friends\r\nhad hitherto detained him, probably on account of her humble station.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus settled his domestic affairs, Kepler now betook himself,\r\nwith his usual industry, to his astronomical studies, and brought before\r\nthe world the most celebrated of his publications, entitled 'Harmonics.'\r\nIn the fifth book of this work he announced his _Third Law_,--that the\r\nsquares of the periodical times of the planets are as the cubes of the\r\ndistances. Kepler's rapture on detecting it was unbounded. \"What,\" says\r\nhe, \"I prophesied two-and-twenty years ago, as soon as I discovered the\r\nfive solids among the heavenly orbits; what I firmly believed long\r\nbefore I had seen Ptolemy's Harmonics; what I had promised my friends in\r\nthe title of this book, which I named before I was sure of my discovery;\r\nwhat, sixteen years ago, I urged as a thing to be sought; that for which\r\nI joined Tycho Brahe, for which I settled in Prague, for which I have\r\ndevoted the best part of my life to astronomical contemplations;--at\r\nlength I have brought to light, and have recognised its truth beyond my\r\nmost sanguine expectations. It is now eighteen months since I got the\r\nfirst glimpse of light, three months since the dawn, very few days since\r\nthe unveiled sun, most admirable to gaze on, burst out upon me. Nothing\r\nholds me: I will indulge in my sacred fury; I will triumph over mankind\r\nby the honest confession, that I have stolen the golden vases of the\r\nEgyptians to build up a tabernacle for my God, far from the confines of\r\nEgypt. If you forgive me, I rejoice: if you are angry, I can bear it;\r\nthe die is cast, the book is written, to be read either now or by\r\nposterity,--I care not which. I may well wait a century for a reader, as\r\nGod has waited six thousand years for an observer.\" In accordance with\r\nthe notion he entertained respecting the \"music of the spheres,\" he made\r\nSaturn and Jupiter take the bass, Mars the tenor, the Earth and Venus\r\nthe counter, and Mercury the treble.\r\n\r\n\"The misery in which Kepler lived,\" says Sir David Brewster, in his\r\n'Life of Newton,' \"forms a painful contrast with the services which he\r\nperformed for science. The pension on which he subsisted was always in\r\narrears; and though the three emperors, whose reigns he adorned,\r\ndirected their ministers to be more punctual in its payment, the\r\ndisobedience of their commands was a source of continual vexation to\r\nKepler. When he retired to Silesia, to spend the remainder of his days,\r\nhis pecuniary difficulties became still more harassing. Necessity at\r\nlength compelled him to apply personally for the arrears which were due;\r\nand he accordingly set out, in 1630, when nearly sixty years of age, for\r\nRatisbon; but, in consequence of the great fatigue which so long a\r\njourney on horseback produced, he was seized with a fever, which put an\r\nend to his life.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Whewell (in his interesting work on Astronomy and General\r\nPhysics considered with reference to Natural Theology) expresses the\r\nopinion that Kepler, notwithstanding his constitutional oddities, was a\r\nman of strong and lively piety. His 'Commentaries on the Motions of\r\nMars' he opens with the following passage: \"I beseech my reader, that,\r\nnot unmindful of the Divine goodness bestowed on man, he do with me\r\npraise and celebrate the wisdom and greatness of the Creator, which I\r\nopen to him from a more inward explication of the form of the world,\r\nfrom a searching of causes, from a detection of the errors of vision;\r\nand that thus, not only in the firmness and stability of the earth, he\r\nperceive with gratitude the preservation of all living things in Nature\r\nas the gift of God, but also that in its motion, so recondite, so\r\nadmirable, he acknowledge the wisdom of the Creator. But him who is too\r\ndull to receive this science, or too weak to believe the Copernican\r\nsystem without harm to his piety,--him, I say, I advise that, leaving\r\nthe school of astronomy, and condemning, if he please, any doctrines of\r\nthe philosophers, he follow his own path, and desist from this wandering\r\nthrough the universe; and, lifting up his natural eyes, with which he\r\nalone can see, pour himself out in his own heart, in praise of God the\r\nCreator; being certain that he gives no less worship to God than the\r\nastronomer, to whom God has given to see more clearly with his inward\r\neye, and who, for what he has himself discovered, both can and will\r\nglorify God.\"\r\n\r\nIn a Life of Kepler, very recently published in his native country,\r\nfounded on manuscripts of his which have lately been brought to light,\r\nthere are given numerous other examples of a similar devotional spirit.\r\nKepler thus concludes his Harmonics: \"I give Thee thanks, Lord and\r\nCreator, that Thou has given me joy through Thy creation; for I have\r\nbeen ravished with the work of Thy hands. I have revealed unto mankind\r\nthe glory of Thy works, as far as my limited spirit could conceive their\r\ninfinitude. Should I have brought forward any thing that is unworthy of\r\nThee, or should I have sought my own fame, be graciously pleased to\r\nforgive me.\"\r\n\r\nAs Galileo experienced the most bitter persecutions from the Church of\r\nRome, so Kepler met with much violent opposition and calumny from the\r\nProtestant clergy of his own country, particularly for adopting, in an\r\nalmanac which, as astronomer royal, he annually published, the reformed\r\ncalendar, as given by the Pope of Rome. His opinions respecting\r\nreligious liberty, also, appear to have been greatly in advance of the\r\ntimes in which he lived. In answer to certain calumnies with which he\r\nwas assailed, for his boldness in reasoning from the light of Nature, he\r\nuttered these memorable words: \"The day will soon break, when pious\r\nsimplicity will be ashamed of its blind superstition; when men will\r\nrecognise truth in the book of Nature as well as in the Holy Scriptures,\r\nand rejoice in the two revelations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXV.\r\n\r\nCOMETS.\r\n\r\n              ----\"Fancy now no more\r\n    Wantons on fickle pinions through the skies,\r\n    But, fixed in aim, and conscious of her power,\r\n    Sublime from cause to cause exults to rise,\r\n    Creation's blended stores arranging as she flies.\"--_Beattie._\r\n\r\nNOTHING in astronomy is more truly admirable, than the knowledge which\r\nastronomers have acquired of the motions of comets, and the power they\r\nhave gained of predicting their return. Indeed, every thing appertaining\r\nto this class of bodies is so wonderful, as to seem rather a tale of\r\nromance than a simple recital of facts. Comets are truly the\r\nknights-errant of astronomy. Appearing suddenly in the nocturnal sky,\r\nand often dragging after them a train of terrific aspect, they were, in\r\nthe earlier ages of the world, and indeed until a recent period,\r\nconsidered as peculiarly ominous of the wrath of Heaven, and as\r\nharbingers of wars and famines, of the dethronement of monarchs, and the\r\ndissolution of empires.\r\n\r\nScience has, it is true, disarmed them of their terrors, and\r\ndemonstrated that they are under the guidance of the same Hand, that\r\ndirects in their courses the other members of the solar system; but she\r\nhas, at the same time, arrayed them in a garb of majesty peculiarly her\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ancients paid little attention to the ordinary phenomena of\r\nNature, hardly deeming them worthy of a reason, yet, when a comet blazed\r\nforth, fear and astonishment conspired to make it an object of the most\r\nattentive observation. Hence the aspects of remarkable comets, that have\r\nappeared at various times, have been handed down to us, often with\r\ncircumstantial minuteness, by the historians of different ages. The\r\ncomet which appeared in the year 130, before the Christian era, at the\r\nbirth of Mithridates, is said to have had a disk equal in magnitude to\r\nthat of the sun. Ten years before this, one was seen, which, according\r\nto Justin, occupied a fourth part of the sky, that is, extended over\r\nforty-five degrees, and surpassed the sun in splendor. In the year 400,\r\none was seen which resembled a sword in shape, and extended from the\r\nzenith to the horizon.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the accounts of comets of past ages; but it is probable\r\nwe must allow much for the exaggerations naturally accompanying the\r\ndescriptions of objects in themselves so truly wonderful.\r\n\r\nA comet, when perfectly formed, consists of three parts, the nucleus,\r\nthe envelope, and the tail. The nucleus, or body of the comet, is\r\ngenerally distinguished by its forming a bright point in the centre of\r\nthe head, conveying the idea of a solid, or at least of a very dense,\r\nportion of matter. Though it is usually exceedingly small, when compared\r\nwith the other parts of the comet, and is sometimes wanting altogether,\r\nyet it occasionally subtends an angle capable of being measured by the\r\ntelescope. The envelope (sometimes called the _coma_, from a Latin word\r\nsignifying hair, in allusion to its hairy appearance) is a dense\r\nnebulous covering, which frequently renders the edge of the nucleus so\r\nindistinct, that it is extremely difficult to ascertain its diameter\r\nwith any degree of precision. Many comets have no nucleus, but present\r\nonly a nebulous mass, exceedingly attenuated on the confines, but\r\ngradually increasing in density towards the centre. Indeed, there is a\r\nregular gradation of comets, from such as are composed merely of a\r\ngaseous or vapory medium, to those which have a well-defined nucleus. In\r\nsome instances on record, astronomers have detected with their\r\ntelescopes small stars through the densest part of a comet. The tail is\r\nregarded as an expansion or prolongation of the coma; and presenting, as\r\nit sometimes does, a train of appalling magnitude, and of a pale,\r\nportentous light, it confers on this class of bodies their peculiar\r\ncelebrity. These several parts are exhibited in Fig. 67, which\r\n[Illustration Figures 67, 68. COMETS OF 1680 AND 1811.] represents the\r\nappearance of the comet of 1680. Fig. 68 also exhibits that of the comet\r\nof 1811.\r\n\r\nThe _number_ of comets belonging to the solar system, is probably very\r\ngreat. Many no doubt escape observation, by being above the horizon in\r\nthe day-time. Seneca mentions, that during a total eclipse of the sun,\r\nwhich happened sixty years before the Christian era, a large and\r\nsplendid comet suddenly made its appearance, being very near the sun.\r\nThe leading particulars of at least one hundred and thirty have been\r\ncomputed, and arranged in a table, for future comparison. Of these,\r\n_six_ are particularly remarkable; namely, the comets of 1680, 1770, and\r\n1811; and those which bear the names of Halley, Biela, and Encke. The\r\ncomet of 1680 was remarkable, not only for its astonishing size and\r\nsplendor, and its near approach to the sun, but is celebrated for having\r\nsubmitted itself to the observations of Sir Isaac Newton, and for having\r\nenjoyed the signal honor of being the first comet whose elements were\r\ndetermined on the sure basis of mathematics. The comet of 1770 is\r\nmemorable for the changes its orbit has undergone by the action of\r\nJupiter, as I shall explain to you more particularly hereafter. The\r\ncomet of 1811 was the most remarkable in its appearance of all that have\r\nbeen seen in the present century. It had scarcely any perceptible\r\nnucleus, but its train was very long and broad, as is represented in\r\nFig. 68. Halley's comet (the same which reappeared in 1835) is\r\ndistinguished as that whose return was first successfully predicted, and\r\nwhose orbit is best determined; and Biela's and Encke's comets are well\r\nknown for their short periods of revolution, which subject them\r\nfrequently to the view of astronomers.\r\n\r\nIn _magnitude and brightness_, comets exhibit great diversity. History\r\ninforms us of comets so bright, as to be distinctly visible in the\r\nday-time, even at noon, and in the brightest sunshine. Such was the\r\ncomet seen at Rome a little before the assassination of Julius Cæsar.\r\nThe comet of 1680 covered an arc of the heavens of ninety-seven\r\ndegrees, and its length was estimated at one hundred and twenty-three\r\nmillions of miles. That of 1811 had a nucleus of only four hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight miles in diameter, but a tail one hundred and thirty-two\r\nmillions of miles long. Had it been coiled around the earth like a\r\nserpent, it would have reached round more than five thousand times.\r\nOther comets are exceedingly small, the nucleus being in one case\r\nestimated at only twenty-five miles; and some, which are destitute of\r\nany perceptible nucleus, appear to the largest telescopes, even when\r\nnearest to us, only as a small speck of fog, or as a tuft of down. The\r\nmajority of comets can be seen only by the aid of the telescope. Indeed,\r\nthe same comet has very different aspects, at its different returns.\r\nHalley's comet, in 1305, was described by the historians of that age as\r\nthe comet of terrific magnitude; (_cometa horrendæ magnitudinis_;) in\r\n1456 its tail reached from the horizon to the zenith, and inspired such\r\nterror, that, by a decree of the Pope of Rome, public prayers were\r\noffered up at noonday in all the Catholic churches, to deprecate the\r\nwrath of heaven; while in 1682 its tail was only thirty degrees in\r\nlength; and in 1759 it was visible only to the telescope until after it\r\nhad passed its perihelion. At its recent return, in 1835, the greatest\r\nlength of the tail was about twelve degrees. These changes in the\r\nappearance of the same comet are partly owing to the different positions\r\nof the earth with respect to them, being sometimes much nearer to them\r\nwhen they cross its track than at others; also, one spectator, so\r\nsituated as to see the comet at a higher angle of elevation, or in a\r\npurer sky, than another, will see the train longer than it appears to\r\nanother less favorably situated; but the extent of the changes are such\r\nas indicate also a real change in magnitude and brightness.\r\n\r\nThe _periods_ of comets in their revolutions around the sun are equally\r\nvarious. Encke's comet, which has the shortest known period, completes\r\nits revolution in three and one third years; or, more accurately, in\r\ntwelve hundred and eight days; while that of 1811 is estimated to have\r\na period of thirty-three hundred and eighty three years.\r\n\r\nThe _distances_ to which different comets recede from the sun are\r\nequally various. While Encke's comet performs its entire revolution\r\nwithin the orbit of Jupiter, Halley's comet recedes from the sun to\r\ntwice the distance of Uranus; or nearly thirty-six hundred millions of\r\nmiles. Some comets, indeed, are thought to go a much greater distance\r\nfrom the sun than this, while some are supposed to pass into curves\r\nwhich do not, like the ellipse, return into themselves; and in this case\r\nthey never come back to the sun. (See Fig. 34, page 153.)\r\n\r\nComets shine _by reflecting the light of the sun_. In one or two\r\ninstances, they have been thought to exhibit distinct _phases_, like the\r\nmoon, although the nebulous matter with which the nucleus is surrounded\r\nwould commonly prevent such phases from being distinctly visible, even\r\nwhen they would otherwise be apparent. Moreover, certain qualities of\r\n_polarized_ light,--an affection by which a ray of light seems to have\r\ndifferent properties on different sides,--enable opticians to decide\r\nwhether the light of a given body is direct or reflected; and M. Arago,\r\nof Paris, by experiments of this kind on the light of the comet of 1819,\r\nascertained it to be reflected light.\r\n\r\nThe tail of a comet usually increases very much as it approaches the\r\nsun; and it frequently does not reach its maximum until after the\r\nperihelion passage. In receding from the sun, the tail again contracts,\r\nand nearly or quite disappears before the body of the comet is entirely\r\nout of sight. The tail is frequently divided into two portions, the\r\ncentral parts, in the direction of the axis, being less bright than the\r\nmarginal parts. In 1744 a comet appeared which had six tails spread out\r\nlike a fan.\r\n\r\nThe tails of comets extend in a direct line from the sun, although more\r\nor less curved, like a long quill or feather, being convex on the side\r\nnext to the direction in which they are moving,--a figure which may\r\nresult from the less velocity of the portion most remote from the sun.\r\nExpansions of the envelope have also been at times observed on the side\r\nnext the sun; but these seldom attain any considerable length.\r\n\r\nThe _quantity of matter_ in comets is exceedingly small. Their tails\r\nconsist of matter of such tenuity, that the smallest stars are visible\r\nthrough them. They can only be regarded as masses of thin vapor,\r\nsusceptible of being penetrated through their whole substance by the\r\nsunbeams, and reflecting them alike from their interior parts and from\r\ntheir surfaces. It appears perhaps incredible, that so thin a substance\r\nshould be visible by reflected light, and some astronomers have held\r\nthat the matter of comets is self-luminous; but it requires but very\r\nlittle light to render an object visible in the night, and a light vapor\r\nmay be visible when illuminated throughout an immense stratum, which\r\ncould not be seen if spread over the face of the sky like a thin cloud.\r\n\"The highest clouds that float in our atmosphere,\" says Sir John\r\nHerschel, \"must be looked upon as dense and massive bodies, compared\r\nwith the filmy and all but spiritual texture of a comet.\"\r\n\r\nThe small quantity of matter in comets is proved by the fact, that they\r\nhave at times passed very near to some of the planets, without\r\ndisturbing their motions in any appreciable degree. Thus the comet of\r\n1770, in its way to the sun, got entangled among the satellites of\r\nJupiter, and remained near them four months; yet it did not perceptibly\r\nchange their motions. The same comet, also, came very near the earth; so\r\nthat, had its quantity of matter been equal to that of the earth, it\r\nwould, by its attraction, have caused the earth to revolve in an orbit\r\nso much larger than at present, as to have increased the length of the\r\nyear two hours and forty-seven minutes. Yet it produced no sensible\r\neffect on the length of the year, and therefore its mass, as is shown by\r\nLa Place, could not have exceeded 1/5000 of that of the earth, and\r\nmight have been less than this to any extent. It may indeed be asked,\r\nwhat proof we have that comets have any matter, and are not mere\r\nreflections of light. The answer is, that, although they are not able by\r\ntheir own force of attraction to disturb the motions of the planets, yet\r\nthey are themselves exceedingly disturbed by the action of the planets,\r\nand in exact conformity with the laws of universal gravitation. A\r\ndelicate compass may be greatly agitated by the vicinity of a mass of\r\niron, while the iron is not sensibly affected by the attraction of the\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\nBy approaching very near to a large planet, a comet may have its orbit\r\nentirely changed. This fact is strikingly exemplified in the history of\r\nthe comet of 1770. At its appearance in 1770, its orbit was found to be\r\nan ellipse, requiring for a complete revolution only five and a half\r\nyears; and the wonder was, that it had not been seen before, since it\r\nwas a very large and bright comet. Astronomers suspected that its path\r\nhad been changed, and that it had been recently compelled to move in\r\nthis short ellipse, by the disturbing force of Jupiter and his\r\nsatellites. The French Institute, therefore, offered a high prize for\r\nthe most complete investigation of the elements of this comet, taking\r\ninto account any circumstances which could possibly have produced an\r\nalteration in its course. By tracing back the movements of this comet,\r\nfor some years previous to 1770, it was found that, at the beginning of\r\n1767, it had entered considerably within the sphere of Jupiter's\r\nattraction. Calculating the amount of this attraction from the known\r\nproximity of the two bodies, it was found what must have been its orbit\r\nprevious to the time when it became subject to the disturbing action of\r\nJupiter. It was therefore evident why, as long as it continued to\r\ncirculate in an orbit so far from the centre of the system, it was never\r\nvisible from the earth. In January, 1767, Jupiter and the comet happened\r\nto be very near to one another, and as both were moving in the same\r\ndirection, and nearly in the same plane, they remained in the\r\nneighborhood of each other for several months, the planet being between\r\nthe comet and the sun. The consequence was, that the comet's orbit was\r\nchanged into a smaller ellipse, in which its revolution was accomplished\r\nin five and a half years. But as it approached the sun, in 1779, it\r\nhappened again to fall in with Jupiter. It was in the month of June that\r\nthe attraction of the planet began to have a sensible effect; and it was\r\nnot until the month of October following, that they were finally\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nAt the time of their nearest approach, in August, Jupiter was distant\r\nfrom the comet only 1/491 of its distance from the sun, and exerted an\r\nattraction upon it two hundred and twenty-five times greater than that\r\nof the sun. By reason of this powerful attraction, Jupiter being further\r\nfrom the sun than the comet, the latter was drawn out into a new orbit,\r\nwhich even at its perihelion came no nearer to the sun than the planet\r\nCeres. In this third orbit, the comet requires about twenty years to\r\naccomplish its revolution; and being at so great a distance from the\r\nearth, it is invisible, and will for ever remain so unless, in the\r\ncourse of ages, it may undergo new perturbations, and move again in some\r\nsmaller orbit, as before.\r\n\r\nWith the foregoing leading facts respecting comets in view, I will now\r\nexplain to you a few things equally remarkable respecting their\r\n_motions_.\r\n\r\nThe paths of the planets around the sun being nearly circular, we are\r\nable to see a planet in every part of its orbit. But the case is very\r\ndifferent with comets. For the greater part of their course, they are\r\nwholly out of sight, and come into view only while just in the\r\nneighborhood of the sun. This you will readily see must be the case, by\r\ninspecting the frontispiece, which represents the orbit of Biela's\r\ncomet, in 1832. Sometimes, the orbit is so eccentric, that the place of\r\nthe focus occupied by the sun appears almost at the extremity of the\r\norbit. This was the case with the orbit of the comet of 1680. Indeed,\r\nthis comet, at its perihelion, came in fact nearer to the sun than the\r\nsixth part of the sun's diameter, being only one hundred and forty-six\r\nthousand miles from the surface of the sun, which, you will remark, is\r\nonly a little more than half the distance of the moon from the earth;\r\nwhile, at its aphelion, it was estimated to be thirteen thousand\r\nmillions of miles from the sun,--more than eleven thousand millions of\r\nmiles beyond the planet Uranus. Its _velocity_, when nearest the sun,\r\nexceeded a million of miles an hour. To describe such an orbit as was\r\nassigned to it by Sir Isaac Newton, would require five hundred and\r\nseventy-five years. During all this period, it was entirely out of view\r\nto the inhabitants of the earth, except the few months, while it was\r\nrunning down to the sun from such a distance as the orbit of Jupiter and\r\nback. The velocity of bodies moving in such eccentric orbits differs\r\nwidely in different parts of their orbits. In the remotest parts it is\r\nso slow, that years would be required to pass over a space equal to that\r\nwhich it would run over in a single day, when near the sun.\r\n\r\nThe appearances of the same comet at different periods of its return are\r\nso various, that we can never pronounce a given comet to be the same\r\nwith one that has appeared before, from any peculiarities in its\r\nphysical aspect, as from its color, magnitude, or shape; since, in all\r\nthese respects, it is very different at different returns; but it is\r\njudged to be the same if its _path_ through the heavens, as traced among\r\nthe stars, is the same.\r\n\r\nThe comet whose history is the most interesting, and which both of us\r\nhave been privileged to see, is Halley's. Just before its latest visit,\r\nin 1835, its return was anticipated with so much expectation, not only\r\nby astronomers, but by all classes of the community, that a great and\r\nlaudable eagerness universally prevailed, to learn the particulars of\r\nits history. The best summary of these, which I met with, was given in\r\nthe Edinburgh Review for April, 1835. I might content myself with barely\r\nreferring you to that well-written article; but, as you may not have the\r\nwork at hand, and would, moreover, probably not desire to read the\r\nwhole article, I will abridge it for your perusal, interspersing some\r\nremarks of my own. I have desired to give you, in the course of these\r\nLetters, some specimen of the labors of astronomers, and shall probably\r\nnever be able to find a better one.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the first recorded appearance of Halley's comet was\r\nthat which was supposed to signalize the birth of Mithridates, one\r\nhundred and thirty years before the birth of Christ. It is said to have\r\nappeared for twenty-four days; its light is said to have surpassed that\r\nof the sun; its magnitude to have extended over a fourth part of the\r\nfirmament; and it is stated to have occupied, consequently, about four\r\nhours in rising and setting. In the year 323, a comet appeared in the\r\nsign Virgo. Another, according to the historians of the Lower Empire,\r\nappeared in the year 399, seventy-six years after the last, at an\r\ninterval corresponding to that of Halley's comet. The interval between\r\nthe birth of Mithridates and the year 323 was four hundred and\r\nfifty-three years, which would be equivalent to six periods of\r\nseventy-five and a half years. Thus it would seem, that in the interim\r\nthere were five returns of this comet unobserved, or at least\r\nunrecorded. The appearance in the year 399 was attended with\r\nextraordinary circumstances. It was described in the old writers as a\r\n\"comet of monstrous size and appalling aspect, its tail seeming to reach\r\ndown to the ground.\" The next recorded appearance of a comet agreeing\r\nwith the ascertained period marks the taking of Rome, in the year\r\n550,--an interval of one hundred and fifty-one years, or two periods of\r\nseventy-five and a half years having elapsed. One unrecorded return\r\nmust, therefore, have taken place in the interim. The next appearance of\r\na comet, coinciding with the assigned period, is three hundred and\r\neighty years afterwards; namely, in the year 930,--five revolutions\r\nhaving been completed in the interval. The next appearance is recorded\r\nin the year 1005, after an interval of a single period of seventy-five\r\nyears. Three revolutions would now seem to have passed unrecorded, when\r\nthe comet again makes its appearance in 1230. In this, as well as in\r\nformer appearances, it is proper to state, that the sole test of\r\nidentity of these cornets with that of Halley is the coincidence of the\r\ntimes, as near as historical records enable us to ascertain, with the\r\nepochs at which the comet of Halley might be expected to appear. That\r\nsuch evidence, however, is very imperfect, must be evident, if the\r\nfrequency of cometary appearances be considered, and if it be\r\nremembered, that hitherto we find no recorded observations, which could\r\nenable us to trace, even with the rudest degree of approximation, the\r\npaths of those comets, the times of whose appearances raise a\r\npresumption of their identity with that of Halley. We now, however,\r\ndescend to times in which more satisfactory evidence may be expected.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1305, a year in which the return of Halley's comet might\r\nhave been expected, there is recorded a comet of remarkable character:\r\n\"A comet of terrific dimensions made its appearance about the time of\r\nthe feast of the Passover, which was followed by a Great Plague.\" Had\r\nthe terrific appearance of this body alone been recorded, this\r\ndescription might have passed without the charge of great exaggeration;\r\nbut when we find the Great Plague connected with it as a consequence, it\r\nis impossible not to conclude, that the comet was seen by its historians\r\nthrough the magnifying medium of the calamity which followed it. Another\r\nappearance is recorded in the year 1380, unaccompanied by any other\r\ncircumstance than its mere date. This, however, is in strict accordance\r\nwith the ascertained period of Halley's comet.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the first appearance at which observations were taken,\r\npossessing sufficient accuracy to enable subsequent investigators to\r\ndetermine the path of the comet; and this is accordingly the first comet\r\nthe identity of which with the comet of Halley can be said to be\r\nconclusively established. In the year 1456, a comet is stated to have\r\nappeared \"of unheard of magnitude;\" it was accompanied by a tail of\r\nextraordinary length, which extended over sixty degrees, (a third part\r\nof the heavens,) and continued to be seen during the whole month of\r\nJune. The influence which was attributed to this appearance renders it\r\nprobable, that in the record there is more or less of exaggeration. It\r\nwas considered as the celestial indication of the rapid success of\r\nMohammed the Second, who had taken Constantinople, and struck terror\r\ninto the whole Christian world. Pope Calixtus the Second levelled the\r\nthunders of the Church against the enemies of his faith, terrestrial and\r\ncelestial; and in the same Bull excommunicated the Turks and the comet;\r\nand, in order that the memory of this manifestation of his power should\r\nbe for ever preserved, he ordained that the bells of all the churches\r\nshould be rung at mid-day,--a custom which is preserved in those\r\ncountries to our times.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary length and brilliancy which was ascribed to the tail,\r\nupon this occasion, have led astronomers to investigate the\r\ncircumstances under which its brightness and magnitude would be the\r\ngreatest possible; and upon tracing back the motion of the comet to the\r\nyear 1456, it has been found that it was then actually in the position,\r\nwith respect to the earth and sun, most favorable to magnitude and\r\nsplendor. So far, therefore, the result of astronomical calculation\r\ncorroborates the records of history.\r\n\r\nThe next return took place in 1531. Pierre Appian, who first ascertained\r\nthe fact that the tails of comets are usually turned from the sun,\r\nexamined this comet with a view to verify his statement, and to\r\nascertain the true direction of its tail. He made, accordingly, numerous\r\nobservations upon its position, which, although rude, compared with the\r\npresent standard of accuracy, were still sufficiently exact to enable\r\nHalley to identify this comet with that observed by himself.\r\n\r\nThe next return took place in 1607, when the comet was observed by\r\nKepler. This astronomer first saw it on the evening of the twenty-sixth\r\nof September, when it had the appearance of a star of the first\r\nmagnitude, and, to his vision, was without a tail; but the friends who\r\naccompanied him had better sight, and distinguished the tail. Before\r\nthree o'clock the following morning the tail had become clearly visible,\r\nand had acquired great magnitude. Two days afterwards, the comet was\r\nobserved by Longomontanus, a distinguished philosopher of the time. He\r\ndescribes its appearance, to the naked eye, to be like Jupiter, but of a\r\npaler and more obscured light; that its tail was of considerable length,\r\nof a paler light than that of the head, and more dense than the tails of\r\nordinary comets.\r\n\r\nThe next appearance, and that which was observed by Halley himself, took\r\nplace in 1682, a little before the publication of the '_Principia_.' In\r\nthe interval between 1607 and 1682, practical astronomy had made great\r\nadvances; instruments of observation had been brought to a state of\r\ncomparative perfection; numerous observatories had been established, and\r\nthe management of them had been confided to the most eminent men in\r\nEurope. In 1682, the scientific world was therefore prepared to examine\r\nthe visitor of our system with a degree of care and accuracy before\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1686, about four years afterwards, Newton published his\r\n'_Principia_,' in which he applied to the comet of 1680 the general\r\nprinciples of physical investigation first promulgated in that work. He\r\nexplained the method of determining, by geometrical construction, the\r\nvisible portion of the path of a body of this kind, and invited\r\nastronomers to apply these principles to the various recorded\r\ncomets,--to discover whether some among them might not have appeared at\r\ndifferent epochs, the future returns of which might consequently be\r\npredicted. Such was the effect of the force of analogy upon the mind of\r\nNewton, that, without awaiting the discovery of a periodic comet, he\r\nboldly assumed these bodies to be analogous to planets in their\r\nrevolution round the sun.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary as these conjectures must have appeared at the time, they\r\nwere soon strictly realized. Halley, who was then a young man, but\r\npossessed one of the best minds in England, undertook the labor of\r\nexamining the circumstances attending all the comets previously\r\nrecorded, with a view to discover whether any, and which of them,\r\nappeared to follow the same path. Antecedently to the year 1700, four\r\nhundred and twenty-five of these bodies had been recorded in history;\r\nbut those which had appeared before the fourteenth century had not been\r\nsubmitted to any observations by which their paths could be\r\nascertained,--at least, not with a sufficient degree of precision, to\r\nafford any hope of identifying them with those of other comets.\r\nSubsequently to the year 1300, however, Halley found twenty-four comets\r\non which observations had been made and recorded, with a degree of\r\nprecision sufficient to enable him to calculate the actual paths which\r\nthese bodies followed while they were visible. He examined, with the\r\nmost elaborate care, the _courses_ of each of these twenty-four bodies;\r\nhe found the exact points at which each one of them crossed the\r\necliptic, or their _nodes_; also the angle which the direction of their\r\nmotion made with that plane,--that is, the _inclination of their\r\norbits_; he also calculated the nearest distance at which each of them\r\napproached the sun, or their _perihelion distance_; and the exact place\r\nof the body when at that nearest point,--that is, the _longitude of the\r\nperihelion_. These particulars are called the _elements_ of a comet,\r\nbecause, when ascertained, they afford sufficient data for determining a\r\ncomet's path. On comparing these paths, Halley found that one, which had\r\nappeared in 1661, followed nearly the same path as one which had\r\nappeared in 1532. Supposing, then, these to be two successive\r\nappearances of the same comet, it would follow, that its period would be\r\none hundred and twenty-nine years, reckoning from 1661. Had this\r\nconjecture been well founded, the comet must have appeared about the\r\nyear 1790. No comet, however, appeared at or near that time, following a\r\nsimilar path.\r\n\r\nIn his second conjecture, Halley was more fortunate, as indeed might be\r\nexpected, since it was formed upon more conclusive grounds. He found\r\nthat the paths of comets which had appeared in 1531 and 1607 were nearly\r\nidentical, and that they were in fact the same as the path followed by\r\nthe comet observed by himself in 1682. He suspected, therefore, that the\r\nappearances at these three epochs were produced by three successive\r\nreturns of the same comet, and that, consequently, its period in its\r\norbit must be about seventy-five and a half years. The probability of\r\nthis conclusion is strikingly exhibited to the eye, by presenting the\r\nelements in a tabular form, from which it will at once be seen how\r\nnearly they correspond at these regular intervals.\r\n\r\n    =====================================================================\r\n    Time.|Inclination of|Long. of the |Long.

Collecting confidence from these circumstances, he announced his\r\ndiscovery as the result of observation and calculation combined, and\r\nentitled to as much confidence as any other consequence of an\r\nestablished physical law.\r\n\r\nThere were, nevertheless, two circumstances which might be supposed to\r\noffer some difficulty. First, the intervals between the supposed\r\nsuccessive returns were not precisely equal; and, secondly, the\r\ninclination of the comet's path to the plane of the earth's orbit was\r\nnot exactly the same in each case. Halley, however, with a degree of\r\nsagacity which, considering the state of knowledge at the time, cannot\r\nfail to excite unqualified admiration, observed, that it was natural to\r\nsuppose that the same causes which disturbed the planetary motions must\r\nlikewise act upon comets; and that their influence would be so much the\r\nmore sensible upon these bodies, because of their great distances from\r\nthe sun. Thus, as the attraction of Jupiter for Saturn was known to\r\naffect the velocity of the latter planet, sometimes retarding and\r\nsometimes accelerating it, according to their relative position, so as\r\nto affect its period to the extent of thirteen days, it might well be\r\nsupposed, that the comet might suffer by a similar attraction an effect\r\nsufficiently great, to account for the inequality observed in the\r\ninterval between its successive returns: and also for the variation to\r\nwhich the direction of its path upon the plane of the ecliptic was found\r\nto be subject. He observed, in fine, that, as in the interval between\r\n1607 and 1682, the comet passed so near Jupiter that its velocity must\r\nhave been augmented, and consequently its period shortened, by the\r\naction of that planet, this period, therefore, having been only\r\nseventy-five years, he inferred that the following period would probably\r\nbe seventy-six years, or upwards; and consequently, that the comet ought\r\nnot to be expected to appear until the end of 1758, or the beginning of\r\n1759. It is impossible to imagine any quality of mind more enviable than\r\nthat which, in the existing state of mathematical physics, could have\r\nled to such a prediction. The imperfect state of mathematical science\r\nrendered it impossible for Halley to offer to the world a demonstration\r\nof the event which he foretold. The theory of gravitation, which was in\r\nits infancy in the time of Halley's investigations, had grown to\r\ncomparative maturity before the period at which his prediction could be\r\nfulfilled. The exigencies of that theory gave birth to new and more\r\npowerful instruments of mathematical inquiry: the differential and\r\nintegral calculus, or the science of fluxions, as it is sometimes\r\ncalled,--a branch of the mathematics, expressed by algebraic symbols,\r\nbut capable of a much higher reach, as an instrument of investigation,\r\nthan either algebra or geometry,--was its first and greatest offspring.\r\nThis branch of science was cultivated with an ardor and success by\r\nwhich it was enabled to answer all the demands of physics, and it\r\ncontributed largely to the advancement of mechanical science itself,\r\nbuilding upon the laws of motion a structure which has since been\r\ndenominated 'Celestial Mechanics.' Newton's discoveries having obtained\r\nreception throughout the scientific world, his inquiries and his\r\ntheories were followed up; and the consequences of the great principle\r\nof universal gravitation were rapidly developed. Since, according to\r\nthis doctrine, _every body in nature attracts and is attracted by every\r\nother body_, it follows, that the comet was liable to be acted on by\r\neach of the planets, as well as by the sun,--a circumstance which\r\nrendered its movements much more difficult to follow, than would be the\r\ncase were it subject merely to the projectile force and to the solar\r\nattraction. To estimate the time it would take for a ship to cross the\r\nAtlantic would be an easy task, were she subject to only one constant\r\nwind; but to estimate, beforehand, the exact influence which all other\r\nwinds and the tides might have upon her passage, some accelerating and\r\nsome retarding her course, would present a problem of the greatest\r\ndifficulty. Clairaut, however, a celebrated French mathematician,\r\nundertook to estimate the effects that would be produced on Halley's\r\ncomet by the attractions of all the planets. His aim was to investigate\r\n_general rules_, by which the computation could be made arithmetically,\r\nand hand them over to the practical calculator, to make the actual\r\ncomputations. Lalande, a practical astronomer, no less eminent in his\r\nown department, and who indeed first urged Clairaut to this inquiry,\r\nundertook the management of the astronomical and arithmetical part of\r\nthe calculation. In this prodigious labor (for it was one of most\r\nappalling magnitude) he was assisted by the wife of an eminent\r\nwatchmaker in Paris, named Lepaute, whose exertions on this occasion\r\nhave deservedly registered her name in astronomical history.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey to one who is not conversant with such\r\ninvestigations, an adequate notion of the labor which such an inquiry\r\ninvolved. The calculation of the influence of any one _planet_ of the\r\nsystem upon any other is itself a problem of some complexity and\r\ndifficulty; but still, one general computation, depending upon the\r\ncalculation of the terms of a certain series, is sufficient for its\r\nsolution. This comparative simplicity arises entirely from two\r\ncircumstances which characterize the planetary orbits. These are, that,\r\nthough they are ellipses, they differ very slightly from circles; and\r\nthough the planets do not move in the plane of the ecliptic, yet none of\r\nthem deviate considerably from that plane. But these characters do not\r\nbelong to the orbits of comets, which, on the contrary, are highly\r\neccentric, and make all possible angles with the ecliptic. The\r\nconsequence of this is, that the calculation of the disturbances\r\nproduced in the cometary orbits by the action of the planets must be\r\nconducted not like the planets, in one general calculation applicable to\r\nthe whole orbits, but in a vast number of separate calculations; in\r\nwhich the orbit is considered, as it were, bit by bit, each bit\r\nrequiring a calculation similar to the whole orbit of the planet. Now,\r\nwhen it is considered that the period of Halley's comet is about\r\nseventy-five years, and that every portion of its course, for two\r\nsuccessive periods, was necessary to be calculated separately in this\r\nway, some notion may be formed of the labor encountered by Lalande and\r\nMadame Lepaute. \"During six months,\" says Lalande, \"we calculated from\r\nmorning till night, sometimes even at meals; the consequence of which\r\nwas, that I contracted an illness which changed my constitution for the\r\nremainder of my life. The assistance rendered by Madame Lepaute was\r\nsuch, that, without her, we never could have dared to undertake this\r\nenormous labor, in which it was necessary to calculate the distance of\r\neach of the two planets, Jupiter and Saturn, from the comet, and their\r\nattraction upon that body, separately, for every successive degree, and\r\nfor one hundred and fifty years.\"\r\n\r\nThe attraction of a body is proportioned to its quantity of matter.\r\nTherefore, before the attraction exerted upon the comet by the several\r\nplanets within whose influence it might fall, could be correctly\r\nestimated, it was necessary to know the mass of each planet; and though\r\nthe planets had severally been weighed by methods supplied by Newton's\r\n'Principia,' yet the estimate had not then attained the same measure of\r\naccuracy as it has now reached; nor was it certain that there was not\r\n(as it has since appeared that there actually was) one or more planets\r\nbeyond Saturn, whose attractions might likewise influence the motions of\r\nthe comet. Clairaut, making the best estimate he was able, under all\r\nthese disadvantages, of the disturbing influence of the planets, fixed\r\nthe return of the comet to the place of its nearest distance from the\r\nsun on the fourth of April, 1759.\r\n\r\nIn the successive appearances of the comet, subsequently to 1456, it was\r\nfound to have gradually decreased in magnitude and splendor. While in\r\n1456 it reached across one third part of the firmament, and spread\r\nterror over Europe, in 1607, its appearance, when observed by Kepler and\r\nLongomontanus, was that of a star of the first magnitude; and so\r\ntrifling was its tail that, Kepler himself, when he first saw it,\r\ndoubted whether it had any. In 1682, it excited little attention, except\r\namong astronomers. Supposing this decrease of magnitude and brilliancy\r\nto be progressive, Lalande entertained serious apprehensions that on its\r\nexpected return it might be so inconsiderable, as to escape the\r\nobservation even of astronomers; and thus, that this splendid example\r\nof the power of science, and unanswerable proof of the principle of\r\ngravitation, would be lost to the world.\r\n\r\nIt is not uninteresting to observe the misgivings of this distinguished\r\nastronomer with respect to the appearance of the body, mixed up with his\r\nunshaken faith in the result of the astronomical inquiry. \"We cannot\r\ndoubt,\" says he, \"that it will return; and even if astronomers cannot\r\nsee it, they will not therefore be the less convinced of its presence.\r\nThey know that the faintness of its light, its great distance, and\r\nperhaps even bad weather, may keep it from our view. But the world will\r\nfind it difficult to believe us; they will place this discovery, which\r\nhas done so much honor to modern philosophy, among the number of chance\r\npredictions. We shall see discussions spring up again in colleges,\r\ncontempt among the ignorant, terror among the people; and seventy-six\r\nyears will roll away, before there will be another opportunity of\r\nremoving all doubt.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately for science, the arrival of the expected visitor did not\r\ntake place under such untoward circumstances. As the commencement of the\r\nyear 1759 approached, \"astronomers,\" says Voltaire, \"hardly went to bed\r\nat all.\" The honor, however, of the first glimpse of the stranger was\r\nnot reserved for the possessors of scientific rank, nor for the members\r\nof academies or universities. On the night of Christmas-day, 1758,\r\nGeorge Palitzch, of Politz, near Dresden,--\"a peasant,\" says Sir John\r\nHerchel, \"by station, an astronomer by nature,\" first saw the comet.\r\n\r\nAn astronomer of Leipzic found it soon after; but, with the mean\r\njealousy of a miser, he concealed his treasure, while his contemporaries\r\nthroughout Europe were vainly directing their anxious search after it to\r\nother quarters of the heavens. At this time, Delisle, a French\r\nastronomer, and his assistant, Messier, who, from his unweared assiduity\r\nin the pursuit of comets, was called the _Comet-Hunter_, had been\r\nconstantly engaged, for eighteen months, in watching for the return of\r\nHalley's comet. Messier passed his life in search of comets. It is\r\nrelated of him, that when he was in expectation of discovering a comet,\r\nhis wife was taken ill and died. While attending on her, being withdrawn\r\nfrom his observatory, another astronomer anticipated him in the\r\ndiscovery. Messier was in despair. A friend, visiting him, began to\r\noffer some consolation for the recent affliction he had suffered.\r\nMessier, thinking only of the comet, exclaimed, \"I had discovered\r\ntwelve: alas, that I should be robbed of the thirteenth by\r\nMontague!\"--and his eyes filled with tears. Then, remembering that it\r\nwas necessary to mourn for his wife, whose remains were still in the\r\nhouse, he exclaimed, \"Ah! this poor woman!\" (_ah! cette pauvre femme_,)\r\nand again wept for his comet. We can easily imagine how eagerly such an\r\nenthusiast would watch for Halley's comet; and we could almost wish that\r\nit had been his good fortune to be the first to announce its arrival:\r\nbut, being misled by a chart which directed his attention to the wrong\r\npart of the firmament, a whole month elapsed after its discovery by\r\nPalitzch, before he enjoyed the delightful spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe comet arrived at its perihelion on the thirteenth of March, only\r\ntwenty-three days from the time assigned by Clairaut. It appeared very\r\nround, with a brilliant nucleus, well distinguished from the surrounding\r\nnebulosity. It had, however, no appearance of a tail. It became lost in\r\nthe sun, as it approached its perihelion, and emerged again, on the\r\nother side of the sun, on the first of April. Its exhibiting an\r\nappearance, so inferior to what it presented on some of its previous\r\nreturns, is partly accounted for by its being seen by the European\r\nastronomers under peculiarly disadvantageous circumstances, being almost\r\nalways within the twilight, and in the most unfavorable situations. In\r\nthe southern hemisphere, however, the circumstances for observing it\r\nwere more favorable, and there it exhibited a tail varying from ten to\r\nforty-seven degrees in length.\r\n\r\nIn my next Letter I will give you some particulars respecting the late\r\nreturn of Halley's comet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nCOMETS, CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n    \"Incensed with indignation, Satan stood\r\n    Unterrified, and like a comet burned,\r\n    That fires the length of Ophiucus huge\r\n    In the Arctic sky, and from his horrid train\r\n    Shakes pestilence and war.\"--_Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\nAMONG other great results which have marked the history of Halley's\r\ncomet, it has itself been a criterion of the existing state of the\r\nmathematical and astronomical sciences. We have just seen how far the\r\nknowledge of the great laws of physical astronomy, and of the higher\r\nmathematics, enabled the astronomers of 1682 and 1759, respectively, to\r\ndeal with this wonderful body; and let us now see what higher advantages\r\nwere possessed by the astronomers of 1835. During this last interval of\r\nseventy-six years, the science of mathematics, in its most profound and\r\nrefined branches, has made prodigious advances, more especially in its\r\napplication to the laws of the celestial motions, as exemplified in the\r\n'Mecanique Celeste' of La Place. The methods of investigation have\r\nacquired greater simplicity, and have likewise become more general and\r\ncomprehensive; and mechanical science, in the largest sense of that\r\nterm, now embraces in its formularies the most complicated motions, and\r\nthe most minute effects of the mutual influences of the various members\r\nof our system. You will probably find it difficult to comprehend, how\r\nsuch hidden facts can be disclosed by formularies, consisting of _a_'s\r\nand _b_'s, and _x_'s and _y_'s, and other algebraic symbols; nor will it\r\nbe easy to give you a clear idea of this subject, without a more\r\nextensive acquaintance than you have formed with algebraic\r\ninvestigations; but you can easily understand that even an equation\r\nexpressed in numbers may be so changed in its form, by adding,\r\nsubtracting, multiplying and dividing, as to express some new truth at\r\nevery transformation. Some idea of this may be formed by the simplest\r\nexample. Take the following: 3+4=7. This equation expresses the fact,\r\nthat three added to four is equal to seven. By multiplying all the terms\r\nby 2, we obtain a new equation, in which 6+8=14. This expresses a new\r\ntruth; and by varying the form, by similar operations, an indefinite\r\nnumber of separate truths may be elicited from the simple fundamental\r\nexpression. I will add another illustration, which involves a little\r\nmore algebra, but not, I think, more than you can understand; or, if it\r\ndoes, you will please pass over it to the next paragraph. According to a\r\nrule of arithmetical progression, _the sum of all the terms is equal to\r\nhalf the sum of the extremes multiplied into the number of terms_.\r\nCalling the sum of the terms _s_, the first term _a_, the last _h_, and\r\nthe number of terms _n_, and we have _(1/2)n(a+h)=s_; or _n(a+h)=2s_; or\r\n_a+h=2s/n_; or _a=(2s/n)-h_; or _h=(2s/n)-a_. These are only a few of\r\nthe changes which may be made in the original expression, still\r\npreserving the equality between the quantities on the left hand and\r\nthose on the right; yet each of these transformations expresses a new\r\ntruth, indicating distinct and (as might be the case) before unknown\r\nrelations between the several quantities of which the whole expression\r\nis composed. The last, for example, shows us that the last term in an\r\narithmetical series is always equal to twice the sum of the whole series\r\ndivided by the number of terms and diminished by the first term. In\r\nanalytical formularies, as expressions of this kind are called, the\r\nvalue of a single unknown quantity is sometimes given in a very\r\ncomplicated expression, consisting of known quantities; but before we\r\ncan ascertain their united value, we must reduce them, by actually\r\nperforming all the additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions,\r\nraising to powers, and extracting roots, which are denoted by the\r\nsymbols. This makes the actual calculations derived from such\r\nformularies immensely laborious. We have already had an instance of this\r\nin the calculations made by Lalande and Madame Lepaute, from formularies\r\nfurnished by Clairaut.\r\n\r\nThe analytical formularies, contained in such works as La Place's\r\n'Mecanique Celeste,' exhibit to the eye of the mathematician a record of\r\nall the evolutions of the bodies of the solar system in ages past, and\r\nof all the changes they must undergo in ages to come. Such has been the\r\nresult of the combination of transcendent mathematical genius and\r\nunexampled labor and perseverance, for the last century. The learned\r\nsocieties established in various centres of civilization have more\r\nespecially directed their attention to the advancement of physical\r\nastronomy, and have stimulated the spirit of inquiry by a succession of\r\nprizes, offered for the solutions of problems arising out of the\r\ndifficulties which were progressively developed by the advancement of\r\nastronomical knowledge. Among these questions, the determination of the\r\nreturn of comets, and the disturbances which they experience in their\r\ncourse, by the action of the planets near which they happen to pass,\r\nhold a prominent place. In 1826, the French Institute offered a prize\r\nfor the determination of the exact time of the return of Halley's comet\r\nto its perihelion in 1835. M. Pontecoulant aspired to the honor. \"After\r\ncalculations,\" says he, \"of which those alone who have engaged in such\r\nresearches can estimate the extent and appreciate the fastidious\r\nmonotony, I arrived at a result which satisfied all the conditions\r\nproposed by the Institute. I determined the perturbations of Halley's\r\ncomet, by taking into account the simultaneous actions of Jupiter,\r\nSaturn, Uranus, and the Earth, and I then fixed its return to its\r\nperihelion for the seventh of November.\" Subsequently to this, however,\r\nM. Pontecoulant made some further researches, which led him to correct\r\nthe former result; and he afterwards altered the time to November\r\nfourteenth. It actually came to its perihelion on the sixteenth, within\r\ntwo days of the time assigned.\r\n\r\nNothing can convince us more fully of the complete mastery which\r\nastronomers have at last acquired over these erratic bodies, than to\r\nread in the Edinburgh Review for April, 1835, the paragraph containing\r\nthe final results of all the labors and anticipations of astronomers,\r\nmatured as they were, in readiness for the approaching visitant, and\r\nthen to compare the prediction with the event, as we saw it fulfilled a\r\nfew months afterwards. The paragraph was as follows: \"On the whole, it\r\nmay be considered as tolerably certain, that the comet will become\r\nvisible in every part of Europe about the latter end of August, or\r\nbeginning of September, next. It will most probably be distinguishable\r\nby the naked eye, like a star of the first magnitude, but with a duller\r\nlight than that of a planet, and surrounded with a pale nebulosity,\r\nwhich will slightly impair its splendor. On the night of the seventh of\r\nOctober, the comet will approach the well-known constellation of the\r\nGreat Bear; and between that and the eleventh, it will pass directly\r\nthrough the seven conspicuous stars of that constellation, (the Dipper.)\r\nTowards the end of November, the comet will plunge among the rays of the\r\nsun, and disappear, and will not issue from them, on the other side,\r\nuntil the end of December.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now see how far the actual appearances corresponded to these\r\npredictions. The comet was first discovered from the observatory at\r\nRome, on the morning of the fifth of August; by Professor Struve, at\r\nDorpat, on the twentieth; in England and France, on the twenty-third;\r\nand at Yale College, by Professor Loomis and myself, on the\r\nthirty-first. On the morning of that day, between two and three o'clock,\r\nin obedience to the directions which the great minds that had marked out\r\nits path among the stars had prescribed, we directed Clarke's telescope\r\n(a noble instrument, belonging to Yale College) towards the\r\nnortheastern quarter of the heavens, and lo! there was the wanderer so\r\nlong foretold,--a dim speck of fog on the confines of creation. It came\r\non slowly, from night to night, increasing constantly in magnitude and\r\nbrightness, but did not become distinctly visible to the naked eye until\r\nthe twenty-second of September. For a month, therefore, astronomers\r\nenjoyed this interesting spectacle before it exhibited itself to the\r\nworld at large. From this time it moved rapidly along the northern sky,\r\nuntil, about the tenth of October, it traversed the constellation of the\r\nGreat Bear, passing a little above, instead of \"through\" the seven\r\nconspicuous stars constituting the Dipper. At this time it had a\r\nlengthened train, and became, as you doubtless remember, an object of\r\nuniversal interest. Early in November, the comet ran down to the sun,\r\nand was lost in his beams; but on the morning of December thirty-first,\r\nI again obtained, through Clarke's telescope, a distinct view of it on\r\nthe other side of the sun, a moment before the morning dawn.\r\n\r\nThis return of Halley's comet was an astronomical event of transcendent\r\nimportance. It was the chronicler of ages, and carried us, by a few\r\nsteps, up to the origin of time. If a gallant ship, which has sailed\r\nround the globe, and commanded successively the admiration of many great\r\ncities, diverse in language and customs, is invested with a peculiar\r\ninterest, what interest must attach to one that has made the circuit of\r\nthe solar system, and fixed the gaze of successive worlds! So intimate,\r\nmoreover, is the bond which binds together all truths in one\r\nindissoluble chain, that the establishment of one great truth often\r\nconfirms a multitude of others, equally important. Thus the return of\r\nHalley's comet, in exact conformity with the predictions of astronomers,\r\nestablished the truth of all those principles by which those predictions\r\nwere made. It afforded most triumphant proof of the doctrine of\r\nuniversal gravitation, and of course of the received laws of physical\r\nastronomy; it inspired new confidence in the power and accuracy of that\r\ninstrument (the calculus) by means of which its elements had been\r\ninvestigated; and it proved that the different planets, which exerted\r\nupon it severally a disturbing force proportioned to their quantity of\r\nmatter, had been correctly weighed, as in a balance.\r\n\r\nI must now leave this wonderful body to pursue its sublime march far\r\nbeyond the confines of Uranus, (a distance it has long since reached,)\r\nand take a hasty notice of two other comets, whose periodic returns have\r\nalso been ascertained; namely, those of Biela and Encke.\r\n\r\nBiela's comet has a period of six years and three quarters. It has its\r\nperihelion near the orbit of the earth, and its aphelion a little beyond\r\nthat of Jupiter. Its orbit, therefore, is far less eccentric than that\r\nof Halley's comet; (see Frontispiece;) it neither approaches so near the\r\nsun, nor departs so far from it, as most other known comets: some,\r\nindeed, never come nearer to the sun than the orbit of Jupiter, while\r\nthey recede to an incomprehensible distance beyond the remotest planet.\r\nWe might even imagine that they would get beyond the limits of the sun's\r\nattraction; nor is this impossible, although, according to La Place, the\r\nsolar attraction is sensible throughout a sphere whose radius is a\r\nhundred millions of times greater than the distance of the earth from\r\nthe sun, or nearly ten thousand billions of miles.\r\n\r\nSome months before the expected return of Biela's comet, in 1832, it was\r\nannounced by astronomers, who had calculated its path, that it would\r\ncross the plane of the earth's orbit very near to the earth's path, so\r\nthat, should the earth happen at the time to be at that point of her\r\nrevolution, a collision might take place. This announcement excited so\r\nmuch alarm among the ignorant classes in France, that it was deemed\r\nexpedient by the French academy, that one of their number should prepare\r\nand publish an article on the subject, with the express view of\r\nallaying popular apprehension. This task was executed by M. Arago. He\r\nadmitted that the earth would in fact pass so near the point where the\r\ncomet crossed the plane of its orbit, that, should they chance to meet\r\nthere, the earth would be enveloped in the nebulous atmosphere of the\r\ncomet. He, however, showed that the earth would not be near that point\r\nat the same time with the comet, but fifty millions of miles from it.\r\n\r\nThe comet came at the appointed time, but was so exceedingly faint and\r\nsmall, that it was visible only to the largest telescopes. In one\r\nrespect, its diminutive size and feeble light enhanced the interest with\r\nwhich it was contemplated; for it was a sublime spectacle to see a body,\r\nwhich, as projected on the celestial vault, even when magnified a\r\nthousand times, seemed but a dim speck of fog, still pursuing its way,\r\nin obedience to the laws of universal gravitation, with the same\r\nregularity as Jupiter and Saturn. We are apt to imagine that a body,\r\nconsisting of such light materials that it can be compared only to the\r\nthinnest fog, would be dissipated and lost in the boundless regions of\r\nspace; but so far is this from the truth, that, when subjected to the\r\naction of the same forces of projection and solar attraction, it will\r\nmove through the void regions of space, and will describe its own orbit\r\nabout the sun with the same unerring certainty, as the densest bodies of\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\nEncke's comet, by its frequent returns, (once in three and a third\r\nyears,) affords peculiar facilities for ascertaining the laws of its\r\nrevolution; and it has kept the appointments made for it with great\r\nexactness. On its return in 1839, it exhibited to the telescope a\r\nglobular mass of nebulous matter, resembling fog, and moved towards its\r\nperihelion with great rapidity. It makes its entire excursions within\r\nthe orbit of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nBut what has made Encke's comet particularly famous, is its having first\r\nrevealed to us the existence of a _resisting medium_ in the planetary\r\nspaces. It has long been a question, whether the earth and planets\r\nrevolve in a perfect void, or whether a fluid of extreme rarity may not\r\nbe diffused through space. A perfect vacuum was deemed most probable,\r\nbecause no such effects on the motions of the planets could be detected\r\nas indicated that they encountered a resisting medium. But a feather, or\r\na lock of cotton, propelled with great velocity, might render obvious\r\nthe resistance of a medium which would not be perceptible in the motions\r\nof a cannon ball. Accordingly, Encke's comet is thought to have plainly\r\nsuffered a retardation from encountering a resisting medium in the\r\nplanetary regions. The effect of this resistance, from the first\r\ndiscovery of the comet to the present time, has been to diminish the\r\ntime of its revolution about two days. Such a resistance, by destroying\r\na part of the projectile force, would cause the comet to approach nearer\r\nto the sun, and thus to have its periodic time shortened. The ultimate\r\neffect of this cause will be to bring the comet nearer to the sun, at\r\nevery revolution, until it finally falls into that luminary, although\r\nmany thousand years will be required to produce this catastrophe. It is\r\nconceivable, indeed, that the effects of such a resistance may be\r\ncounteracted by the attraction of one or more of the planets, near which\r\nit may pass in its successive returns to the sun. Still, it is not\r\nprobable that this cause will exactly counterbalance the other; so that,\r\nif there is such an elastic medium diffused through the planetary\r\nregions, it must follow that, in the lapse of ages, every comet will\r\nfall into the sun. Newton conjectured that this would be the case,\r\nalthough he did not found his opinion upon the existence of such a\r\nresisting medium as is now detected. To such an opinion he adhered to\r\nthe end of life. At the age of eighty-three, in a conversation with his\r\nnephew, he expressed himself thus: \"I cannot say when the comet of 1680\r\nwill fall into the sun; possibly after five or six revolutions; but\r\nwhenever that time shall arrive, the heat of the sun will be raised by\r\nit to such a point, that our globe will be burned, and all the animals\r\nupon it will perish.\"\r\n\r\nOf the _physical nature_ of comets little is understood. The greater\r\npart of them are evidently mere masses of vapor, since they permit very\r\nsmall stars to be seen through them. In September, 1832, Sir John\r\nHerschel, when observing Biela's comet, saw that body pass directly\r\nbetween his eye and a small cluster of minute telescopic stars of the\r\nsixteenth or seventeenth magnitude. This little constellation occupied a\r\nspace in the heavens, the breadth of which was not the twentieth part of\r\nthat of the moon; yet the whole of the cluster was distinctly visible\r\nthrough the comet. \"A more striking proof,\" says Sir John Herschel,\r\n\"could not have been afforded, of the extreme transparency of the matter\r\nof which this comet consists. The most trifling fog would have entirely\r\neffaced this group of stars, yet they continued visible through a\r\nthickness of the comet which, calculating on its distance and apparent\r\ndiameter, must have exceeded fifty thousand miles, at least towards its\r\ncentral parts.\" From this and similar observations, it is inferred, that\r\nthe nebulous matter of comets is vastly more rare than that of the air\r\nwe breathe, and hence, that, were more or less of it to be mingled with\r\nthe earth's atmosphere, it would not be perceived, although it might\r\npossibly render the air unwholesome for respiration. M. Arago, however,\r\nis of the opinion, that some comets, at least, have a solid nucleus. It\r\nis difficult, on any other supposition, to account for the strong light\r\nwhich some of them have exhibited,--a light sufficiently intense to\r\nrender them visible in the day-time, during the presence of the sun. The\r\nintense heat to which comets are subject, in approaching so near the sun\r\nas some of them do, is alleged as a sufficient reason for the great\r\nexpansion of the thin vapory atmospheres which form their tails; and the\r\ninconceivable cold to which they are subject, in receding to such a\r\ndistance from the sun, is supposed to account for the condensation of\r\nthe same matter until it returns to its original dimensions. Thus the\r\ngreat comet of 1680, at its perihelion, approached within one hundred\r\nand forty-six thousand miles of the surface of the sun, a distance of\r\nonly one sixth part of the sun's diameter. The heat which it must have\r\nreceived was estimated to be equal to twenty-eight thousand times that\r\nwhich the earth receives in the same time, and two thousand times hotter\r\nthan red-hot iron. This temperature would be sufficient to volatilize\r\nthe most obdurate substances, and to expand the vapor to vast\r\ndimensions; and the opposite effects of the extreme cold to which it\r\nwould be subject in the regions remote from the sun would be adequate to\r\ncondense it into its former volume. This explanation, however, does not\r\naccount for the direction of the tail, extending, as it usually does,\r\nonly in a line opposite to the sun. Some writers, therefore, suppose\r\nthat the nebulous matter of the comet, after being expanded to such a\r\nvolume that the particles are no longer attracted to the nucleus, unless\r\nby the slightest conceivable force, are carried off in a direction from\r\nthe sun, by the impulse of the solar rays themselves. But to assign such\r\na power to the sun's rays, while they have never been proved to have any\r\nmomentum, is unphilosophical; and we are compelled to place the\r\nphenomena of comets' tails among the points of astronomy yet to be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nSince comets which approach very near the sun, like the comet of 1680,\r\ncross the orbits of all the planets, the possibility that one of them\r\nmay strike the earth has frequently been suggested. Still it may quiet\r\nour apprehensions on this subject, to reflect on the vast amplitude of\r\nthe planetary spaces, in which these bodies are not crowded together, as\r\nwe see them erroneously represented in orreries and diagrams, but are\r\nsparsely scattered at immense distances from each other. They are like\r\ninsects flying, singly, in the expanse of heaven. If a comet's tail lay\r\nwith its axis in the plane of the ecliptic when it was near the sun, we\r\ncan imagine that the tail might sweep over the earth; but the tail may\r\nbe situated at any angle with the ecliptic, as well as in the same plane\r\nwith it, and the chances that it will not be in the same plane are\r\nalmost infinite. It is also extremely improbable that a comet will cross\r\nthe plane of the ecliptic precisely at the earth's path in that plane,\r\nsince it may as probably cross it at any other point nearer or more\r\nremote from the sun. A French writer of some eminence (Du Sejour) has\r\ndiscussed this subject with ability, and arrived at the following\r\nconclusions: That of all the comets whose paths had been ascertained,\r\nnone _could pass_ nearer to the earth than about twice the moon's\r\ndistance; and that none ever _did pass_ nearer to the earth than nine\r\ntimes the moon's distance. The comet of 1770, already mentioned, which\r\nbecame entangled among the satellites of Jupiter, came within this\r\nlimit. Some have taken alarm at the idea that a comet, by approaching\r\nvery near to the earth, might raise so high a _tide_, as to endanger the\r\nsafety of maritime countries especially: but this writer shows, that the\r\ncomet could not possibly remain more than two hours so near the earth as\r\na fourth part of the moon's distance; and it could not remain even so\r\nlong, unless it passed the earth under very peculiar circumstances. For\r\nexample, if its orbit were nearly perpendicular to that of the earth, it\r\ncould not remain more than half an hour in such a position. Under such\r\ncircumstances, the production of a tide would be impossible. Eleven\r\nhours, at least, would be necessary to enable a comet to produce an\r\neffect on the waters of the earth, from which the injurious effects so\r\nmuch dreaded would follow. The final conclusion at which he arrives is,\r\nthat although, in strict geometrical rigor, it is not physically\r\nimpossible that a comet should encounter the earth, yet the probability\r\nof such an event is absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nM. Arago, also, has investigated the probability of such a collision on\r\nthe mathematical doctrine of chances, and remarks as follows: \"Suppose,\r\nnow, a comet, of which we know nothing but that, at its perihelion, it\r\nwill be nearer the sun than we are, and that its diameter is equal to\r\none fourth that of the earth; the doctrine of chances shows that, out of\r\ntwo hundred and eighty-one millions of cases, there is but one against\r\nus; but one, in which the two bodies could meet.\"\r\n\r\nLa Place has assigned the consequences that would result from a direct\r\ncollision between the earth and a comet. \"It is easy,\" says he, \"to\r\nrepresent the effects of the shock produced by the earth's encountering\r\na comet. The axis and the motion of rotation changed; the waters\r\nabandoning their former position to precipitate themselves towards the\r\nnew equator; a great part of men and animals whelmed in a universal\r\ndeluge, or destroyed by the violent shock imparted to the terrestrial\r\nglobe; entire species annihilated; all the monuments of human industry\r\noverthrown;--such are the disasters which the shock of a comet would\r\nnecessarily produce.\" La Place, nevertheless, expresses a decided\r\nopinion that the orbits of the planets have never yet been disturbed by\r\nthe influence of comets. Comets, moreover, have been, and are still to\r\nsome degree, supposed to exercise much influence in the affairs of this\r\nworld, affecting the weather, the crops, the public health, and a great\r\nvariety of atmospheric commotions. Even Halley, finding that his comet\r\nmust have been near the earth at the time of the Deluge, suggested the\r\npossibility that the comet caused that event,--an idea which was taken\r\nup by Whiston, and formed into a regular theory. In Gregory's Astronomy,\r\nan able work, published at Oxford in 1702, the author remarks, that\r\namong all nations and in all ages, it has been observed, that the\r\nappearance of a comet has always been followed by great calamities; and\r\nhe adds, \"it does not become philosophers lightly to set down these\r\nthings as fables.\" Among the various things ascribed to comets by a late\r\nEnglish writer, are hot and cold seasons, tempests, hurricanes, violent\r\nhail-storms, great falls of snow, heavy rains, inundations, droughts,\r\nfamines, thick fogs, flies, grasshoppers, plague, dysentery, contagious\r\ndiseases among animals, sickness among cats, volcanic eruptions, and\r\nmeteors, or shooting stars. These notions are too ridiculous to require\r\na distinct refutation; and I will only add, that we have no evidence\r\nthat comets have hitherto ever exercised the least influence upon the\r\naffairs of this world; and we still remain in darkness, with respect to\r\ntheir physical nature, and the purposes for which they were created.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nMETEORIC SHOWERS.\r\n\r\n    \"Oft shalt thou see, ere brooding storms arise,\r\n    Star after star glide headlong down the skies,\r\n    And, where they shot, long trails of lingering light\r\n    Sweep far behind, and gild the shades of night.\"--_Virgil._\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW subjects of astronomy have excited a more general interest, for\r\nseveral years past, than those extraordinary exhibitions of shooting\r\nstars, which have acquired the name of meteoric showers. My reason for\r\nintroducing the subject to your notice, in this place, is, that these\r\nsmall bodies are, as I believe, derived from nebulous or cometary\r\nbodies, which belong to the solar system, and which, therefore, ought to\r\nbe considered, before we take our leave of this department of creation,\r\nand naturally come next in order to comets.\r\n\r\nThe attention of astronomers was particularly directed to this subject\r\nby the extraordinary shower of meteors which occurred on the morning of\r\nthe thirteenth of November, 1833. I had the good fortune to witness\r\nthese grand celestial fire-works, and felt a strong desire that a\r\nphenomenon, which, as it afterwards appeared, was confined chiefly to\r\nNorth America, should here command that diligent inquiry into its\r\ncauses, which so sublime a spectacle might justly claim.\r\n\r\nAs I think you were not so happy as to witness this magnificent display,\r\nI will endeavor to give you some faint idea of it, as it appeared to me\r\na little before daybreak. Imagine a constant succession of fire-balls,\r\nresembling sky-rockets, radiating in all directions from a point in the\r\nheavens a few degrees southeast of the zenith, and following the arch of\r\nthe sky towards the horizon. They commenced their progress at different\r\ndistances from the radiating point; but their directions were uniformly\r\nsuch, that the lines they described, if produced upwards, would all have\r\nmet in the same part of the heavens. Around this point, or imaginary\r\nradiant, was a circular space of several degrees, within which no\r\nmeteors were observed. The balls, as they travelled down the vault,\r\nusually left after them a vivid streak of light; and, just before they\r\ndisappeared, exploded, or suddenly resolved themselves into smoke. No\r\nreport of any kind was observed, although we listened attentively.\r\n\r\nBeside the foregoing distinct concretions, or individual bodies, the\r\natmosphere exhibited _phosphoric lines_, following in the train of\r\nminute points, that shot off in the greatest abundance in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction. These did not so fully copy the figure of the\r\nsky, but moved in paths more nearly rectilinear, and appeared to be much\r\nnearer the spectator than the fire-balls. The light of their trains was\r\nalso of a paler hue, not unlike that produced by writing with a stick of\r\nphosphorus on the walls of a dark room. The number of these luminous\r\ntrains increased and diminished alternately, now and then crossing the\r\nfield of view, like snow drifted before the wind, although, in fact,\r\ntheir course was towards the wind.\r\n\r\nFrom these two varieties, we were presented with meteors of various\r\nsizes and degrees of splendor: some were mere points, while others were\r\nlarger and brighter than Jupiter or Venus; and one, seen by a credible\r\nwitness, at an earlier hour, was judged to be nearly as large as the\r\nmoon. The flashes of light, although less intense than lightning, were\r\nso bright, as to awaken people in their beds. One ball that shot off in\r\nthe northwest direction, and exploded a little northward of the star\r\nCapella, left, just behind the place of explosion, a phosphorescent\r\ntrain of peculiar beauty. This train was at first nearly straight, but\r\nit shortly began to contract in length, to dilate in breadth, and to\r\nassume the figure of a serpent drawing itself up, until it appeared like\r\na small luminous cloud of vapor. This cloud was borne eastward, (by the\r\nwind, as was supposed, which was blowing gently in that direction,)\r\nopposite to the direction in which the meteor itself had moved,\r\nremaining in sight several minutes. The point from which the meteors\r\nseemed to radiate kept a fixed position among the stars, being\r\nconstantly near a star in Leo, called Gamma Leonis.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief description of this grand and beautiful display, as I\r\nsaw it at New Haven. The newspapers shortly brought us intelligence of\r\nsimilar appearances in all parts of the United States, and many minute\r\ndescriptions were published by various observers; from which it\r\nappeared, that the exhibition had been marked by very nearly the same\r\ncharacteristics wherever it had been seen. Probably no celestial\r\nphenomenon has ever occurred in this country, since its first\r\nsettlement, which was viewed with so much admiration and delight by one\r\nclass of spectators, or with so much astonishment and fear by another\r\nclass. It strikingly evinced the progress of knowledge and civilization,\r\nthat the latter class was comparatively so small, although it afforded\r\nsome few examples of the dismay with which, in barbarous ages of the\r\nworld, such spectacles as this were wont to be regarded. One or two\r\ninstances were reported, of persons who died with terror; many others\r\nthought the last great day had come; and the untutored black population\r\nof the South gave expression to their fears in cries and shrieks.\r\n\r\nAfter collecting and collating the accounts given in all the periodicals\r\nof the country, and also in numerous letters addressed either to my\r\nscientific friends or to myself, the following appeared to be the\r\n_leading facts_ attending the phenomenon. The shower pervaded nearly\r\nthe whole of North America, having appeared in nearly equal splendor\r\nfrom the British possessions on the north to the West-India Islands and\r\nMexico on the south, and from sixty-one degrees of longitude east of the\r\nAmerican coast, quite to the Pacific Ocean on the west. Throughout this\r\nimmense region, the duration was nearly the same. The meteors began to\r\nattract attention by their unusual frequency and brilliancy, from _nine\r\nto twelve_ o'clock in the evening; were most striking in their\r\nappearance from _two to five;_ arrived at their maximum, in many places,\r\nabout _four_ o'clock; and continued until rendered invisible by the\r\nlight of day. The meteors moved either in right lines, or in such\r\napparent curves, as, upon optical principles, can be resolved into right\r\nlines. Their general tendency was towards the northwest, although, by\r\nthe effect of perspective, they appeared to move in various directions.\r\n\r\nSuch were the leading phenomena of the great meteoric shower of November\r\n13, 1833. For a fuller detail of the facts, as well as of the reasonings\r\nthat were built on them, I must beg leave to refer you to some papers of\r\nmine in the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth volumes of the American\r\nJournal of Science.\r\n\r\nSoon after this wonderful occurrence, it was ascertained that a similar\r\nmeteoric shower had appeared in 1799, and, what was remarkable, almost\r\nat exactly the same time of year, namely, on the morning of the twelfth\r\nof November; and we were again surprised as well as delighted, at\r\nreceiving successive accounts from different parts of the world of the\r\nphenomenon, as having occurred on the morning of the same thirteenth of\r\nNovember, in 1830, 1831, and 1832. Hence this was evidently an event\r\nindependent of the casual changes of the atmosphere; for, having a\r\nperiodical return, it was undoubtedly to be referred to astronomical\r\ncauses, and its recurrence, at a certain definite period of the year,\r\nplainly indicated _some_ relation to the revolution of the earth around\r\nthe sun. It remained, however, to develope the nature of this relation,\r\nby investigating, if possible, the origin of the meteors. The views to\r\nwhich I was led on this subject suggested the probability that the same\r\nphenomenon would recur on the corresponding seasons of the year, for at\r\nleast several years afterwards; and such proved to be the fact, although\r\nthe appearances, at every succeeding return, were less and less\r\nstriking, until 1839, when, so far as I have heard, they ceased\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nMean-while, two other distinct periods of meteoric showers have, as\r\nalready intimated, been determined; namely, about the ninth of August,\r\nand seventh of December. The facts relative to the history of these\r\nperiods have been collected with great industry by Mr. Edward C.\r\nHerrick; and several of the most ingenious and most useful conclusions,\r\nrespecting the laws that regulate these singular exhibitions, have been\r\ndeduced by Professor Twining. Several of the most distinguished\r\nastronomers of the Old World, also, have engaged in these investigations\r\nwith great zeal, as Messrs. Arago and Biot, of Paris; Doctor Olbers, of\r\nBremen; M. Wartmann, of Geneva; and M. Quetelet, of Brussels.\r\n\r\nBut you will be desirous to learn what are the _conclusions_ which have\r\nbeen drawn respecting these new and extraordinary phenomena of the\r\nheavens. As the inferences to which I was led, as explained in the\r\ntwenty-sixth volume of the 'American Journal of Science,' have, at least\r\nin their most important points, been sanctioned by astronomers of the\r\nhighest respectability, I will venture to give you a brief abstract of\r\nthem, with such modifications as the progress of investigation since\r\nthat period has rendered necessary.\r\n\r\nThe principal questions involved in the inquiry were the following:--Was\r\nthe _origin_ of the meteors within the atmosphere, or beyond it? What\r\nwas the _height_ of the place above the surface of the earth? By what\r\n_force_ were the meteors drawn or impelled towards the earth? In what\r\n_directions_ did they move? With what _velocity_? What was the cause of\r\ntheir _light_ and _heat_? Of what _size_ were the larger varieties? At\r\nwhat height above the earth did they _disappear_? What was the nature of\r\nthe _luminous trains_ which sometimes remained behind? What _sort of\r\nbodies_ were the meteors themselves; of what _kind of matter_\r\nconstituted; and in what manner did they exist _before they fell to the\r\nearth_? Finally, what _relations_ did the source from which they\r\nemanated sustain to our earth?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, _the meteors had their origin beyond the limits of\r\nour atmosphere_. We know whether a given appearance in the sky is within\r\nthe atmosphere or beyond it, by this circumstance: all bodies near the\r\nearth, including the atmosphere itself, have a common motion with the\r\nearth around its axis from west to east. When we see a celestial object\r\nmoving regularly from west to east, at the same rate as the earth moves,\r\nleaving the stars behind, we know it is near the earth, and partakes, in\r\ncommon with the atmosphere, of its diurnal rotation: but when the earth\r\nleaves the object behind; or, in other words, when the object moves\r\nwestward along with the stars, then we know that it is so distant as not\r\nto participate in the diurnal revolution of the earth, and of course to\r\nbe beyond the atmosphere. The source from which the meteors emanated\r\nthus kept pace with the stars, and hence was beyond the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, _the height of the place whence the meteors\r\nproceeded was very great, but it has not yet been accurately\r\ndetermined_. Regarding the body whence the meteors emanated after the\r\nsimilitude of a cloud, it seemed possible to obtain its height in the\r\nsame manner as we measure the height of a cloud, or indeed the height of\r\nthe moon. Although we could not see the body itself, yet the part of the\r\nheavens whence the meteors came would indicate its position. This point\r\nwe called the _radiant_; and the question was, whether the radiant was\r\nprojected by distant observers on different parts of the sky; that is,\r\nwhether it had any _parallax_. I took much pains to ascertain the truth\r\nof this matter, by corresponding with various observers in different\r\nparts of the United States, who had accurately noted the position of the\r\nradiant among the fixed stars, and supposed I had obtained such\r\nmaterials as would enable us to determine the parallax, at least\r\napproximately; although such discordances existed in the evidence as\r\nreasonably to create some distrust of its validity. Putting together,\r\nhowever, the best materials I could obtain, I made the height of the\r\nradiant above the surface of the earth _twenty-two hundred and\r\nthirty-eight miles_. When, however, I afterwards obtained, as I\r\nsupposed, some insight into the celestial origin of the meteors, I at\r\nonce saw that the meteoric body must be much further off than this\r\ndistance; and my present impression is, that we have not the means of\r\ndetermining what its height really is. We may safely place it at many\r\nthousand miles.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, with respect to the _force_ by which the meteors\r\nwere _drawn_ or impelled towards the earth, my first impression was,\r\nthat they fell merely by the force of _gravity_; but the velocity which,\r\non careful investigation by Professor Twining and others, has been\r\nascribed to them, is greater than can possibly result from gravity,\r\nsince a body can never acquire, by gravity alone, a velocity greater\r\nthan about seven miles per second. Some other cause, beside gravity,\r\nmust therefore act, in order to give the meteors so great an apparent\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, _the meteors fell towards the earth in straight\r\nlines, and in directions which, within considerable distances, were\r\nnearly parallel with each other_. The courses are inferred to have been\r\nin _straight lines_, because no others could have appeared to spectators\r\nin different situations to have described arcs of great circles. In\r\norder to be projected into the arc of a great circle, the line of\r\ndescent must be in a plane passing through the eye of the spectator; and\r\nthe intersection of such planes, passing through the eyes of different\r\nspectators, must be straight lines. The lines of direction are inferred\r\nto have been _parallel_, on account of their apparent radiation from one\r\npoint, that being the vanishing point of parallel lines. This may\r\nappear to you a little paradoxical, to infer that lines are parallel,\r\nbecause they _diverge_ from one and the same point; but it is a\r\nwell-known principle of perspective, that parallel lines, when continued\r\nto a great distance from the eye, appear to converge towards the remoter\r\nend. You may observe this in two long rows of trees, or of street lamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 69.]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the manner in which the meteors fell, and of the reason of\r\ntheir apparent radiation from a common point, may be gathered from the\r\nannexed diagram. Let A B C, Fig. 69, represent the vault of the sky,\r\nthe centre of which, D, being the place of the spectator. Let 1, 2, 3,\r\n&c., represent parallel lines directed towards the earth. A luminous\r\nbody descending through 1' 1, coinciding with the line D E, coincident\r\nwith the axis of vision, (or the line drawn from the meteoric body to\r\nthe eye,) would appear stationary all the while at 1´, because distant\r\nbodies always appear stationary when they are moving either directly\r\ntowards us or directly from us. A body descending through 2 2, would\r\nseem to describe the short arc 2' 2', appearing to move on the concave\r\nof the sky between the lines drawn from the eye to the two extremities\r\nof its line of motion; and, for a similar reason, a body descending\r\nthrough 3 3, would appear to describe the larger arc 3' 3'. Hence, those\r\nmeteors which fell nearer to the axis of vision, would describe shorter\r\narcs, and move slower, while those which were further from the axis and\r\nnearer the horizon would appear to describe longer arcs, and to move\r\nwith greater velocity; the meteors would all seem to radiate from a\r\ncommon centre, namely, the point where the axis of vision met the\r\ncelestial vault; and if any meteor chanced to move directly in the line\r\nof vision, it would be seen as a luminous body, stationary, for a few\r\nseconds, at the centre of radiation. To see how exactly the facts, as\r\nobserved, corresponded to these inferences, derived from the supposition\r\nthat the meteors moved in _parallel lines_, take the following\r\ndescription, as given immediately after the occurrence, by Professor\r\nTwining. \"In the vicinity of the radiant point, a few star-like bodies\r\nwere observed, possessing very little motion, and leaving very little\r\nlength of trace. Further off, the motions were more rapid and the traces\r\nlonger; and most rapid of all, and longest in their traces, were those\r\nwhich originated but a few degrees above the horizon, and descended down\r\nto it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fifth place, had the meteors come from a point twenty-two hundred\r\nand thirty-eight miles from the earth, and derived their apparent\r\nvelocity from gravity alone, then it would be found, by a very easy\r\ncalculation, that their actual velocity was about four miles per second;\r\nbut, as already intimated, the velocity observed was estimated much\r\ngreater than could be accounted for on these principles; not less,\r\nindeed, than fourteen miles per second, and, in some instances, much\r\ngreater even than this. The motion of the earth in its orbit is about\r\nnineteen miles per second; and the most reasonable supposition we can\r\nmake, at present, to account for the great velocity of the meteors, is,\r\nthat they derived a relative motion from the earth's passing rapidly by\r\nthem,--a supposition which is countenanced by the fact that they\r\ngenerally tended _westward_ contrary to the earth's motion in its orbit.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth place, _the meteors consisted of combustible matter, and\r\ntook fire, and were consumed, in traversing the atmosphere_. That these\r\nbodies underwent combustion, we had the direct evidence of the senses,\r\ninasmuch as we saw them burn. That they took fire in the _atmosphere_,\r\nwas inferred from the fact that they were not luminous in their original\r\nsituations in space, otherwise, we should have seen the body from which\r\nthey emanated; and had they been luminous before reaching the\r\natmosphere, we should have seen them for a much longer period than they\r\nwere in sight, as they must have occupied a considerable time in\r\ndescending towards the earth from so great a distance, even at the rapid\r\nrate at which they travelled. The immediate consequence of the\r\nprodigious velocity with which the meteors fell into the atmosphere must\r\nbe a powerful condensation of the air before them, retarding their\r\nprogress, and producing, by a sudden compression of the air, a great\r\nevolution of heat. There is a little instrument called the _air-match_,\r\nconsisting of a piston and cylinder, like a syringe, in which we strike\r\na light by suddenly forcing down the piston upon the air below. As the\r\nair cannot escape, it is suddenly compressed, and gives a spark\r\nsufficient to light a piece of tinder at the bottom of the cylinder.\r\nIndeed, it is a well-known fact, that, whenever air is suddenly and\r\nforcibly compressed, heat is elicited; and, if by such a compression as\r\nmay be given by the hand in the air-match, heat is evolved sufficient to\r\nfire tinder, what must be the heat evolved by the motion of a large body\r\nin the atmosphere, with a velocity so immense. It is common to resort to\r\nelectricity as the agent which produces the heat and light of shooting\r\nstars; but even were electricity competent to produce this effect, its\r\npresence, in the case before us, is not proved; and its agency is\r\nunnecessary, since so swift a motion of the meteors themselves, suddenly\r\ncondensing the air before them, is both a known and adequate cause of an\r\nintense light and heat. A combustible body falling into the atmosphere,\r\nunder such circumstances, would become speedily ignited, but could not\r\nburn freely, until it became enveloped in air of greater density; but,\r\non reaching the lower portions of the atmosphere, it would burn with\r\ngreat rapidity.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh place, _some of the larger meteors must have been bodies\r\nof great size_. According to the testimony of various individuals, in\r\ndifferent parts of the United States, a few fire-balls appeared as large\r\nas the full moon. Dr. Smith, (then of North Carolina, but since\r\nsurgeon-general of the Texian army,) who was travelling all night on\r\nprofessional business, describes one which he saw in the following\r\nterms: \"In size it appeared somewhat larger than the full moon rising. I\r\nwas startled by the splendid light in which the surrounding scene was\r\nexhibited, rendering even small objects quite visible; but I heard no\r\nnoise, although every sense seemed to be suddenly aroused, in sympathy\r\nwith the violent impression on the sight.\" This description implies not\r\nonly that the body was very large, but that it was at a considerable\r\ndistance from the spectator. Its actual size will depend upon the\r\ndistance; for, as it appeared under the same angle as the moon, its\r\ndiameter will bear the same ratio to the moon's, as its distance bears\r\nto the moon's distance. We could, therefore, easily ascertain how large\r\nit was, provided we could find how far it was from the observer. If it\r\nwas one hundred and ten miles distant, its diameter was one mile, and in\r\nthe same proportion for a greater or less distance; and, if only at the\r\ndistance of one mile, its diameter was forty-eight feet. For a moderate\r\nestimate, we will suppose it to have been twenty-two miles off; then its\r\ndiameter was eleven hundred and fifty-six feet. Upon every view of the\r\ncase, therefore, it must be admitted, that these were bodies of great\r\nsize, compared with other objects which traverse the atmosphere. We may\r\nfurther infer the great magnitude of some of the meteors, from the\r\ndimensions of the trains, or clouds, which resulted from their\r\ndestruction. These often extended over several degrees, and at length\r\nwere borne along in the direction of the wind, exactly in the manner of\r\na small cloud.\r\n\r\nIt was an interesting problem to ascertain, if possible, the height\r\nabove the earth at which these fire-balls exploded, or resolved\r\nthemselves into a cloud of smoke. This would be an easy task, provided\r\nwe could be certain that two or more distant observers could be sure\r\nthat both saw the same meteor; for as each would refer the place of\r\nexplosion, or the position of the cloud that resulted from it, to a\r\ndifferent point of the sky, a parallax would thus be obtained, from\r\nwhich the height might be determined. The large meteor which is\r\nmentioned in my account of the shower, (see page 348,) as having\r\nexploded near the star Capella, was so peculiar in its appearance, and\r\nin the form and motions of the small cloud which resulted from its\r\ncombustion, that it was noticed and distinguished by a number of\r\nobservers in distant parts of the country. All described the meteor as\r\nexhibiting, substantially, the same peculiarities of appearance; all\r\nagreed very nearly in the time of its occurrence; and, on drawing lines,\r\nto represent the course and direction of the place where it exploded to\r\nthe view of each of the observers respectively, these lines met in\r\nnearly one and the same point, and that was over the place where it was\r\nseen in the zenith. Little doubt, therefore, could remain, that all saw\r\nthe same body; and on ascertaining, from a comparison of their\r\nobservations, the amount of parallax, and thence deducing its height,--a\r\ntask which was ably executed by Professor Twining,--the following\r\nresults were obtained: that this meteor, and probably all the meteors,\r\nentered the atmosphere with a velocity not less, but perhaps greater,\r\nthan _fourteen miles in a second_; that they became luminous many miles\r\nfrom the earth,--in this case, over _eighty miles_; and became extinct\r\nhigh above the surface,--in this case, nearly _thirty miles_.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth place, _the meteors were combustible bodies, and were\r\nconstituted of light and transparent materials_. The fact that they\r\nburned is sufficient proof that they belonged to the class of\r\n_combustible_ bodies; and they must have been composed of very _light\r\nmaterials_, otherwise their momentum would have been sufficient to\r\nenable them to make their way through the atmosphere to the surface of\r\nthe earth. To compare great things with small, we may liken them to a\r\nwad discharged from a piece of artillery, its velocity being supposed to\r\nbe increased (as it may be) to such a degree, that it shall take fire as\r\nit moves through the air. Although it would force its way to a great\r\ndistance from the gun, yet, if not consumed too soon, it would at length\r\nbe stopped by the resistance of the air. Although it is supposed that\r\nthe meteors did in fact slightly disturb the atmospheric equilibrium,\r\nyet, had they been constituted of dense matter, like meteoric stones,\r\nthey would doubtless have disturbed it vastly more. Their own momentum\r\nwould be lost only as it was imparted to the air; and had such a number\r\nof bodies,--some of them quite large, perhaps a mile in diameter, and\r\nentering the atmosphere with a velocity more than forty times the\r\ngreatest velocity of a cannon ball,--had they been composed of dense,\r\nponderous matter, we should have had appalling evidence of this fact,\r\nnot only in the violent winds which they would have produced in the\r\natmosphere, but in the calamities they would have occasioned on the\r\nsurface of the earth. The meteors were _transparent_ bodies; otherwise,\r\nwe cannot conceive why the body from which they emanated was not\r\ndistinctly visible, at least by reflecting the light of the sun. If only\r\nthe meteors which were known to fall towards the earth had been\r\ncollected and restored to their original connexion in space, they would\r\nhave composed a body of great extent; and we cannot imagine a body of\r\nsuch dimensions, under such circumstances, which would not be visible,\r\nunless formed of highly transparent materials. By these unavoidable\r\ninferences respecting the kind of matter of which the meteors were\r\ncomposed, we are unexpectedly led to recognise a body bearing, in its\r\nconstitution, a strong analogy to comets, which are also composed of\r\nexceedingly light and transparent, and, as there is much reason to\r\nbelieve, of combustible matter.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the final inquiry, _what relations did the body which\r\nafforded the meteoric shower sustain to the earth_? Was it of the nature\r\nof a satellite, or terrestrial comet, that revolves around the earth as\r\nits centre of motion? Was it a collection of nebulous, or cometary\r\nmatter, which the earth encountered in its annual progress? or was it a\r\ncomet, which chanced at this time to be pursuing its path along with the\r\nearth, around their common centre of motion? It could not have been of\r\nthe nature of a satellite to the earth, (or one of those bodies which\r\nare held by some to afford the meteoric stones, which sometimes fall to\r\nthe earth from huge meteors that traverse the atmosphere,) because it\r\nremained so long stationary with respect to the earth. A body so near\r\nthe earth as meteors of this class are known to be, could not remain\r\napparently stationary among the stars for a moment; whereas the body in\r\nquestion occupied the same position, with hardly any perceptible\r\nvariation, for at least two hours. Nor can we suppose that the earth, in\r\nits annual progress, came into the vicinity of a _nebula_, which was\r\neither stationary, or wandering lawless through space. Such a collection\r\nof matter could not remain stationary within the solar system, in an\r\ninsulated state, for, if not prevented by a motion of its own, or by the\r\nattraction of some nearer body, it would have proceeded directly towards\r\nthe sun; and had it been in motion in any other direction than that in\r\nwhich the earth was moving, it would soon have been separated from the\r\nearth; since, during the eight hours, while the meteoric shower was\r\nvisible, the earth moved in its orbit through the space of nearly five\r\nhundred and fifty thousand miles.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations conduct us to the following train of\r\nreasoning. First, if all the meteors which fell on the morning of\r\nNovember 13, 1833, had been collected and restored to their original\r\nconnexion in space, they would of themselves have constituted a nebulous\r\nbody of great extent; but we have reason to suppose that they, in fact,\r\ncomposed but a small part of the mass from which they emanated, since,\r\nafter the loss of so much matter as proceeded from it in the great\r\nmeteoric shower of 1799, and in the several repetitions of it that\r\npreceded the year 1833, it was still capable of affording so copious a\r\nshower on that year; and similar showers, more limited in extent, were\r\nrepeated for at least five years afterwards. We are therefore to regard\r\nthe part that descended only as _the extreme portions of a body or\r\ncollection of meteors, of unknown extent, existing in the planetary\r\nspaces_.\r\n\r\nSecondly, since the earth fell in with this body in the same part of its\r\norbit, for several years in succession, it must either have remained\r\nthere while the earth was performing its whole revolution around the\r\nsun, or it must itself have had a revolution, as well as the earth. But\r\nI have already shown that it could not have remained stationary in that\r\npart of space; therefore, _it must have had a revolution around the\r\nsun_.\r\n\r\nThirdly, its period of revolution must have either been greater than the\r\nearth's, equal to it, or less. It could not have been greater, for then\r\nthe two bodies could not have been together again at the end of the\r\nyear, since the meteoric body would not have completed its revolution in\r\na year. Its period might obviously be the same as the earth's, for then\r\nthey might easily come together again after one revolution of each;\r\nalthough their orbits might differ so much in shape as to prevent their\r\nbeing together at any intermediate point. But the period of the body\r\nmight also be less than that of the earth, provided it were some\r\n_aliquot part of a year_, so as to revolve just twice, or three times,\r\nfor example, while the earth revolves once. Let us suppose that the\r\nperiod is one third of a year. Then, since we have given the periodic\r\ntimes of the two bodies, and the major axis of the orbit of one of them,\r\nnamely, of the earth, we can, by Kepler's law, find the major axis of\r\nthe other orbit; for the square of the earth's periodic time 1^2 is to\r\nthe square of the body's time (1/3)^2 as the cube of the major axis of\r\nthe earth's orbit is to the cube of the major axis of the orbit in\r\nquestion. Now, the three first terms of this proportion are known, and\r\nconsequently, it is only to solve a case in the simple rule of three, to\r\nfind the term required. On making the calculation, it is found, that the\r\nsupposition of a periodic time of only one third of a year gives an\r\norbit of insufficient length; the whole major axis would not reach from\r\nthe sun to the earth; and consequently, a body revolving in it could\r\nnever come near to the earth. On making trial of six months, we obtain\r\nan orbit which satisfies the conditions, being such as is represented by\r\nthe diagram on page 362, Fig. 69', where the outer circle denotes the\r\nearth's orbit, the sun being in the centre, and the inner ellipse\r\ndenotes the path of the meteoric body. The two bodies are together at\r\nthe top of the figure, being the place of the meteoric body's aphelion\r\non the thirteenth of November, and the figures 10, 20, &c., denote the\r\nrelative positions of the earth and the body for every ten days, for a\r\nperiod of six months, in which time the body would have returned to its\r\naphelion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 69'.]\r\n\r\nSuch would be the relation of the body that affords the meteoric shower\r\nof November, provided its revolution is accomplished in six months; but\r\nit is still somewhat uncertain whether the period be half a year or a\r\nyear; it must be one or the other.\r\n\r\nIf we inquire, now, why the meteors always appear to radiate from a\r\npoint in the constellation Leo, recollecting that this is the point to\r\nwhich the body is projected among the stars, the answer is, that this\r\nis the very point towards which the earth is moving in her orbit at that\r\ntime; so that if, as we have proved, the earth passed through or near a\r\nnebulous body on the thirteenth of November, that body must necessarily\r\nhave been projected into the constellation Leo, else it could not have\r\nlain directly in her path. I consider it therefore as established by\r\nsatisfactory proof, that the meteors of November thirteenth emanate from\r\na nebulous or cometary body, revolving around the sun, and coming so\r\nnear the earth at that time that the earth passes through its _skirts_,\r\nor extreme portions, and thus attracts to itself some portions of its\r\nmatter, giving to the meteors a greater velocity than could be imparted\r\nby gravity alone, in consequence of passing rapidly by them.\r\n\r\nAll these conclusions were made out by a process of reasoning strictly\r\ninductive, without supposing that the meteoric body itself had ever been\r\nseen. But there are some reasons for believing that we do actually see\r\nit, and that it is no other than that mysterious appearance long known\r\nunder the name of the _zodiacal light_. This is a faint light, which at\r\ncertain seasons of the year appears in the west after evening twilight,\r\nand at certain other seasons appears in the east before the dawn,\r\nfollowing or preceding the track of the sun in a triangular figure, with\r\nits broad base next to the sun, and its vertex reaching to a greater or\r\nless distance, sometimes more than ninety degrees from that luminary.\r\nYou may obtain a good view of it in February or March, in the west, or\r\nin October, in the morning sky. The various changes which this light\r\nundergoes at different seasons of the year are such as to render it\r\nprobable, to my mind, that this is the very body which affords the\r\nmeteoric showers; its extremity coming, in November, within the sphere\r\nof the earth's attraction. But, as the arguments for the existence of a\r\nbody in the planetary regions, which affords these showers, were drawn\r\nwithout the least reference to the zodiacal light, and are good, should\r\nit finally be proved that this light has no connexion with them, I will\r\nnot occupy your attention with the discussion of this point, to the\r\nexclusion of topics which will probably interest you more.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps most probable, that the meteoric showers of August and\r\nDecember emanate from the same body. I know of nothing repugnant to this\r\nconclusion, although it has not yet been distinctly made out. Had the\r\nperiods of the earth and of the meteoric body been so adjusted to each\r\nother that the latter was contained an exact even number of times in the\r\nformer; that is, had it been _exactly_ either a year or half a year;\r\nthen we might expect a similar recurrence of the meteoric shower every\r\nyear; but only a slight variation in such a proportion between the two\r\nperiods would occasion the repetition of the shower for a few years in\r\nsuccession, and then an intermission of them, for an unknown length of\r\ntime, until the two bodies were brought into the same relative situation\r\nas before. Disturbances, also, occasioned by the action of Venus and\r\nMercury, might wholly subvert this numerical relation, and increase or\r\ndiminish the probability of a repetition of the phenomenon. Accordingly,\r\nfrom the year 1830, when the meteoric shower of November was first\r\nobserved, until 1833, there was a regular increase of the exhibition; in\r\n1833, it came to its maximum; and after that time it was repeated upon a\r\nconstantly diminishing scale, until 1838, since which time it has not\r\nbeen observed. Perhaps ages may roll away before the world will be again\r\nsurprised and delighted with a display of celestial fire-works equal to\r\nthat of the morning of November 13, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nFIXED STARS.\r\n\r\n                     ----\"O, majestic Night!\r\n    Nature's great ancestor! Day's elder born,\r\n    And fated to survive the transient sun!\r\n    By mortals and immortals seen with awe!\r\n    A starry crown thy raven brow adorns,\r\n    An azure zone thy waist; clouds, in heaven's loom\r\n    Wrought, through varieties of shape and shade,\r\n    In ample folds of drapery divine,\r\n    Thy flowing mantle form; and heaven throughout\r\n    Voluminously pour thy pompous train.\"--_Young._\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE the solar system is but one among a myriad of worlds which\r\nastronomy unfolds, it may appear to you that I have dwelt too long on so\r\ndiminutive a part of creation, and reserved too little space for the\r\nother systems of the universe. But however humble a province our sun and\r\nplanets compose, in the vast empire of Jehovah, yet it is that which\r\nmost concerns us; and it is by the study of the laws by which this part\r\nof creation is governed, that we learn the secrets of the skies.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, the observation and study of the phenomena of the solar\r\nsystem almost exclusively occupied the labors of astronomers. But Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel gave his chief attention to the _sidereal heavens_, and\r\nopened new and wonderful fields of discovery, as well as of speculation.\r\nThe same subject, has been prosecuted with similar zeal and success by\r\nhis son, Sir John Herschel, and Sir James South, in England, and by\r\nProfessor Struve, of Dorpat, until more has been actually achieved than\r\npreceding astronomers had ventured to conjecture. A limited sketch of\r\nthese wonderful discoveries is all that I propose to offer you.\r\n\r\nThe fixed stars are so called, because, to common observation, they\r\nalways maintain the same situations with respect to one another. The\r\nstars are classed by their apparent _magnitudes_. The whole number of\r\nmagnitudes recorded are _sixteen_, of which the first six only are\r\nvisible to the naked eye; the rest are _telescopic stars_. These\r\nmagnitudes are not determined by any very definite scale, but are merely\r\nranked according to their relative degrees of brightness, and this is\r\nleft in a great measure to the decision of the eye alone. The brightest\r\nstars, to the number of fifteen or twenty, are considered as stars of\r\nthe first magnitude; the fifty or sixty next brightest, of the second\r\nmagnitude; the next two hundred, of the third magnitude; and thus the\r\nnumber of each class increases rapidly, as we descend the scale, so that\r\nno less than fifteen or twenty thousand are included within the first\r\nseven magnitudes.\r\n\r\nThe stars have been grouped in _constellations_ from the most remote\r\nantiquity; a few, as Orion, Bootes, and Ursa Major, are mentioned in the\r\nmost ancient writings, under the same names as they bear at present. The\r\nnames of the constellations are sometimes founded on a supposed\r\nresemblance to the objects to which they belong; as the Swan and the\r\nScorpion were evidently so denominated from their likeness to those\r\nanimals; but in most cases, it is impossible for us to find any reason\r\nfor designating a constellation by the figure of the animal or hero\r\nwhich is employed to represent it. These representations were probably\r\nonce blended with the fables of pagan mythology. The same figures,\r\nabsurd as they appear, are still retained for the convenience of\r\nreference; since it is easy to find any particular star, by specifying\r\nthe part of the figure to which it belongs; as when we say, a star is in\r\nthe neck of Taurus, in the knee of Hercules, or in the tail of the Great\r\nBear. This method furnishes a general clue to its position; but the\r\nstars belonging to any constellation are distinguished according to\r\ntheir apparent magnitudes, as follows: First, by the Greek letters,\r\nAlpha, Beta, Gamma, &c. Thus, _Alpha Orionis_ denotes the largest star\r\nin Orion; _Beta Andromedæ_ the second star in Andromeda; and _Gamma\r\nLeonis_, the third brightest star in the Lion. When the number of the\r\nGreek letters is insufficient to include all the stars in a\r\nconstellation, recourse is had to the letters of the Roman alphabet, a,\r\nb, c, &c.; and in all cases where these are exhausted the final resort\r\nis to numbers. This is evidently necessary, since the largest\r\nconstellations contain many hundreds or even thousands of stars.\r\n_Catalogues_ of particular stars have also been published, by different\r\nastronomers, each author numbering the individual stars embraced in his\r\nlist according to the places they respectively occupy in the catalogue.\r\nThese references to particular catalogues are sometimes entered on large\r\ncelestial globes. Thus we meet with a star marked 84 H., meaning that\r\nthis is its number in Herschel's catalogue; or 140 M., denoting the\r\nplace the star occupies in the catalogue of Mayer.\r\n\r\nThe earliest catalogue of the stars was made by Hipparchus, of the\r\nAlexandrian school, about one hundred and forty years before the\r\nChristian era. A new star appearing in the firmament, he was induced to\r\ncount the stars, and to record their positions, in order that posterity\r\nmight be able to judge of the permanency of the constellations. His\r\ncatalogue contains all that were conspicuous to the naked eye in the\r\nlatitude of Alexandria, being one thousand and twenty-two. Most persons,\r\nunacquainted with the actual number of the stars which compose the\r\nvisible firmament, would suppose it to be much greater than this; but it\r\nis found that the catalogue of Hipparchus embraces nearly all that can\r\nnow be seen in the same latitude; and that on the equator, where the\r\nspectator has both the northern and southern hemispheres in view, the\r\nnumber of stars that can be counted does not exceed three thousand. A\r\ncareless view of the firmament in a clear night gives us the impression\r\nof an infinite number of stars; but when we begin to count them, they\r\nappear much more sparsely distributed than we supposed, and large\r\nportions of the sky appear almost destitute of stars.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the telescope, new fields of stars present themselves, of\r\nboundless extent; the number continually augmenting, as the powers of\r\nthe telescope are increased. Lalande, in his 'Histoire Celeste,' has\r\nregistered the positions of no less than fifty thousand; and the whole\r\nnumber visible in the largest telescopes amounts to many millions.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the firmament on a clear Autumnal or Winter evening, it\r\nappears so thickly studded with stars, that you would perhaps imagine\r\nthat the task of learning even the brightest of them would be almost\r\nhopeless. Let me assure you, this is all a mistake. On the contrary, it\r\nis a very easy task to become acquainted with the names and positions of\r\nthe stars of the first magnitude, and of the leading constellations. If\r\nyou will give a few evenings to the study, you will be surprised to\r\nfind, both how rapidly you can form these new acquaintances, and how\r\ndeeply you will become interested in them. I would advise you, at first,\r\nto obtain, for an evening or two, the assistance of some friend who is\r\nfamiliar with the stars, just to point out a few of the most conspicuous\r\nconstellations. This will put you on the track, and you will afterwards\r\nexperience no difficulty in finding all the constellations and stars\r\nthat are particularly worth knowing; especially if you have before you a\r\nmap of the stars, or, what is much better, a celestial globe. It is a\r\npleasant evening recreation for a small company of young astronomers to\r\ngo out together, and learn one or two constellations every favorable\r\nevening, until the whole are mastered. If you have a celestial globe,\r\n_rectify_ it for the evening; that is, place it in such a position, that\r\nthe constellations shall be seen on it in the same position with respect\r\nto the horizon, that they have at that moment in the sky itself. To do\r\nthis, I first elevate the north pole until the number of degrees on the\r\nbrass meridian from the pole to the horizon corresponds to my latitude,\r\n(forty-one degrees and eighteen minutes.) I then find the sun's place in\r\nthe ecliptic, by looking for the day of the month on the broad horizon,\r\nand against it noting the corresponding sign and degree. I now find the\r\nsame sign and degree on the ecliptic itself, and bring that point to the\r\nbrass meridian. As that will be the position of the sun at noon, I set\r\nthe hour-index at twelve, and then turn the globe westward, until the\r\nindex points to the given hour of the evening. If I now inspect the\r\nfigures of the constellations, and then look upward at the firmament, I\r\nshall see that the latter are spread over the sky in the same manner as\r\nthe pictures of them are painted on the globe. I will point out a few\r\nmarks by which the leading constellations may be recognised; this will\r\naid you in finding them, and you can afterwards learn the individual\r\nstars of a constellation, to any extent you please, by means of the\r\nglobes or maps. Let us begin with the _Constellations of the Zodiac_,\r\nwhich, succeeding each other, as they do, in a known order, are most\r\neasily found.\r\n\r\n_Aries_ (_the Ram_) is a small constellation, known by two bright stars\r\nwhich form his head, _Alpha_ and _Beta Arietis_. These two stars are\r\nabout four degrees apart; and directly south of Beta, at the distance of\r\none degree, is a smaller star, _Gamma Arietis_. It has been already\r\nintimated that the Vernal equinox probably was near the head of Aries,\r\nwhen the signs of the zodiac received their present names.\r\n\r\n_Taurus_ (_the Bull_) will be readily found by the seven stars, or\r\n_Pleiades_, which lie in his neck. The largest star in Taurus is\r\n_Aldebaran_, in the Bull's eye, a star of the first magnitude, of a\r\nreddish color, somewhat resembling the planet Mars. Aldebaran and four\r\nother stars, close together in the face of Taurus, compose the _Hyades_.\r\n\r\n_Gemini_ (_the Twins_) is known by two very bright stars, _Castor and\r\nPollux_, five degrees asunder. Castor (the northern) is of the first,\r\nand Pollux of the second, magnitude.\r\n\r\n_Cancer_ (_the Crab_.) There are no large stars in this constellation,\r\nand it is regarded as less remarkable than any other in the zodiac. It\r\ncontains, however, an interesting group of small stars, called\r\n_Præsepe_, or the nebula of Cancer, which resembles a comet, and is\r\noften mistaken for one, by persons unacquainted with the stars. With a\r\ntelescope of very moderate powers this nebula is converted into a\r\nbeautiful assemblage of exceedingly bright stars.\r\n\r\n_Leo_ (_the Lion_) is a very large constellation, and has many\r\ninteresting members. _Regulus_ (_Alpha Leonis_) is a star of the first\r\nmagnitude, which lies directly in the ecliptic, and is much used in\r\nastronomical observations. North of Regulus, lies a semicircle of bright\r\nstars, forming a _sickle_, of which Regulus is the handle. _Denebola_, a\r\nstar of the second magnitude, is in the Lion's tail, twenty-five degrees\r\nnortheast of Regulus.\r\n\r\n_Virgo_ (_the Virgin_) extends a considerable way from west to east, but\r\ncontains only a few bright stars. _Spica_, however, is a star of the\r\nfirst magnitude, and lies a little east of the place of the Autumnal\r\nequinox. Eighteen degrees eastward of Denebola, and twenty degrees north\r\nof Spica, is _Vindemiatrix_, in the arm of Virgo, a star of the third\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n_Libra_ (_the Balance_) is distinguished by three large stars, of which\r\nthe two brightest constitute the beam of the balance, and the smallest\r\nforms the top or handle.\r\n\r\n_Scorpio_ (_the Scorpion_) is one of the finest of the constellations.\r\nHis head is formed of five bright stars, arranged in the arc of a\r\ncircle, which is crossed in the centre by the ecliptic nearly at right\r\nangles, near the brightest of the five, _Beta Scorpionis_. Nine degrees\r\nsoutheast of this is a remarkable star of the first magnitude, of a\r\nreddish color, called _Cor Scorpionis_, or _Antares_. South of this, a\r\nsuccession of bright stars sweep round towards the east, terminating in\r\nseveral small stars, forming the tail of the Scorpion.\r\n\r\n_Sagittarius_ (_the Archer_.) Northeast of the tail of the Scorpion are\r\nthree stars in the arc of a circle, which constitute the _bow_ of the\r\nArcher, the central star being the brightest, directly west of which is\r\na bright star which forms the _arrow_.\r\n\r\n_Capricornus_ (_the Goat_) lies northeast of Sagittarius, and is known\r\nby two bright stars, three degrees apart, which form the head.\r\n\r\n_Aquarius_ (_the Water-Bearer_) is recognised by two stars in a line\r\nwith _Alpha Capricorni_, forming the shoulders of the figure. These two\r\nstars are ten degrees apart; and three degrees southeast is a third\r\nstar, which, together with the other two, make an acute triangle, of\r\nwhich the westernmost is the vertex.\r\n\r\n_Pisces_ (_the Fishes_) lie between Aquarius and Aries. They are not\r\ndistinguished by any large stars, but are connected by a series of small\r\nstars, that form a crooked line between them. _Piscis Australia_, the\r\nSouthern Fish, lies directly below Aquarius, and is known by a single\r\nbright star far in the south, having a declination of thirty degrees.\r\nThe name of this star is _Fomalhaut_, and it is much used in\r\nastronomical measurements.\r\n\r\nThe constellations of the zodiac, being first well learned, so as to be\r\nreadily recognised, will facilitate the learning of others that lie\r\nnorth and south of them. Let us, therefore, next review the principal\r\n_Northern Constellations_, beginning north of Aries, and proceeding from\r\nwest to east.\r\n\r\n_Andromeda_ is characterized by three stars of the second magnitude,\r\nsituated in a straight line, extending from west to east. The middle\r\nstar is about seventeen degrees north of Beta Arietis. It is in the\r\ngirdle of Andromeda, and is named _Mirach_. The other two lie at about\r\nequal distances, fourteen degrees west and east of Mirach. The western\r\nstar, in the head of Andromeda, lies in the equinoctial colure. The\r\neastern star, _Alamak_, is situated in the foot.\r\n\r\n_Perseus_ lies directly north of the Pleiades, and contains several\r\nbright stars. About eighteen degrees from the Pleiades is _Algol_, a\r\nstar of the second magnitude, in the head of Medusa, which forms a part\r\nof the figure; and nine degrees northeast of Algol is _Algenib_, of the\r\nsame magnitude, in the back of Perseus. Between Algenib and the Pleiades\r\nare three bright stars, at nearly equal intervals, which compose the\r\nright leg of Perseus.\r\n\r\n_Auriga_ (_the Wagoner_) lies directly east of Perseus, and extends\r\nnearly parallel to that constellation, from north to south. _Capella_, a\r\nvery white and beautiful star of the first magnitude, distinguishes this\r\nconstellation. The feet of Auriga are near the Bull's horns.\r\n\r\nThe _Lynx_ comes next, but presents nothing particularly interesting,\r\ncontaining no stars above the fourth magnitude.\r\n\r\n_Leo Minor_ consists of a collection of small stars north of the sickle\r\nin Leo, and south of the Great Bear. Its largest star is only of the\r\nthird magnitude.\r\n\r\n_Coma Berenices_ is a cluster of small stars, north of Denebola, in the\r\ntail of the Lion, and of the head of Virgo. About twelve degrees\r\ndirectly north of Berenice's hair, is a single bright star, called _Cor\r\nCaroli_, or Charles's Heart.\r\n\r\n_Bootes_, which comes next, is easily found by means of _Arcturus_, a\r\nstar of the first magnitude, of a reddish color, which is situated near\r\nthe knee of the figure. Arcturus is accompanied by three small stars,\r\nforming a triangle a little to the southwest. Two bright stars, _Gamma_\r\nand _Delta Bootis_, form the shoulders, and _Beta_, of the third\r\nmagnitude, is in the head, of the figure.\r\n\r\n_Corona Borealis_, (_the Crown_,) which is situated east of Bootes, is\r\nvery easily recognised, composed as it is of a semicircle of bright\r\nstars. In the centre of the bright crown is a star of the second\r\nmagnitude, called _Gemma_: the remaining stars are all much smaller.\r\n\r\n_Hercules_, lying between the Crown on the west and the Lyre on the\r\neast, is very thickly set with stars, most of which are quite small.\r\nThis constellation covers a great extent of the sky, especially from\r\nnorth to south, the head terminating within fifteen degrees of the\r\nequator, and marked by a star of the third magnitude, called _Ras\r\nAlgethi_, which is the largest in the constellation.\r\n\r\n_Ophiucus_ is situated directly south of Hercules, extending some\r\ndistance on both sides of the equator, the feet resting on the Scorpion.\r\nThe head terminates near the head of Hercules, and, like that, is marked\r\nby a bright star within five degrees of _Alpha Herculis_ Ophiucus is\r\nrepresented as holding in his hands the _Serpent_, the head of which,\r\nconsisting of three bright stars, is situated a little south of the\r\nCrown. The folds of the serpent will be easily followed by a succession\r\nof bright stars, which extend a great way to the east.\r\n\r\n_Aquila_ (_the Eagle_) is conspicuous for three bright stars in its\r\nneck, of which the central one, _Altair_, is a very brilliant white star\r\nof the first magnitude. _Antinous_ lies directly south of the Eagle, and\r\nnorth of the head of Capricornus.\r\n\r\n_Delphinus_ (_the Dolphin_) is a small but beautiful constellation, a\r\nfew degrees east of the Eagle, and is characterized by four bright stars\r\nnear to one another, forming a small rhombic square. Another star of the\r\nsame magnitude, five degrees south, makes the tail.\r\n\r\n_Pegasus_ lies between Aquarius on the southwest and Andromeda on the\r\nnortheast. It contains but few large stars. A very regular square of\r\nbright stars is composed of _Alpha Andromedæ_ and the three largest\r\nstars in Pegasus; namely, _Scheat_, _Markab_, and _Algenib_. The sides\r\ncomposing this square are each about fifteen degrees. Algenib is\r\nsituated in the equinoctial colure.\r\n\r\nWe may now review the _Constellations which surround the north pole_,\r\nwithin the circle of perpetual apparition.\r\n\r\n_Ursa Minor_ (_the Little Bear_) lies nearest the pole. The pole-star,\r\n_Polaris_, is in the extremity of the tail, and is of the third\r\nmagnitude. Three stars in a straight line, four degrees or five degrees\r\napart, commencing with the pole-star, lead to a trapezium of four stars,\r\nand the whole seven form together a _dipper_,--the trapezium being the\r\nbody and the three stars the handle.\r\n\r\n_Ursa Major_ (_the Great Bear_) is situated between the pole and the\r\nLesser Lion, and is usually recognised by the figure of a larger and\r\nmore perfect dipper which constitutes the hinder part of the animal.\r\nThis has also seven stars, four in the body of the Dipper and three in\r\nthe handle. All these are stars of much celebrity. The two in the\r\nwestern side of the Dipper, Alpha and Beta, are called _Pointers_, on\r\naccount of their always being in a right line with the pole-star, and\r\ntherefore affording an easy mode of finding that. The first star in the\r\ntail, next the body, is named _Alioth_, and the second, _Mizar_. The\r\nhead of the Great Bear lies far to the westward of the Pointers, and is\r\ncomposed of numerous small stars; and the feet are severally composed of\r\ntwo small stars very near to each other.\r\n\r\n_Draco_ (_the Dragon_) winds round between the Great and the Little\r\nBear; and, commencing with the tail, between the Pointers and the\r\npole-star, it is easily traced by a succession of bright stars extending\r\nfrom west to east. Passing under Ursa Minor, it returns westward, and\r\nterminates in a triangle which forms the head of Draco, near the feet of\r\nHercules, northwest of Lyra. _Cepheus_ lies eastward of the breast of\r\nthe Dragon, but has no stars above the third magnitude.\r\n\r\n_Cassiopeia_ is known by the figure of a _chair_, composed of four stars\r\nwhich form the legs, and two which form the back. This constellation\r\nlies between Perseus and Cepheus, in the Milky Way.\r\n\r\n_Cygnus_ (_the Swan_) is situated also in the Milky Way, some distance\r\nsouthwest of Cassiopeia, towards the Eagle. Three bright stars, which\r\nlie along the Milky Way, form the body and neck of the Swan, and two\r\nothers, in a line with the middle one of the three, one above and one\r\nbelow, constitute the wings. This constellation is among the few that\r\nexhibit some resemblance to the animals whose names they bear.\r\n\r\n_Lyra_ (_the Lyre_) is directly west of the Swan, and is easily\r\ndistinguished by a beautiful white star of the first magnitude, _Alpha\r\nLyræ_.\r\n\r\nThe _Southern Constellations_ are comparatively few in number. I shall\r\nnotice only the Whale, Orion, the Greater and Lesser Dog, Hydra, and the\r\nCrow.\r\n\r\n_Cetus_ (_the Whale_) is distinguished rather for its extent than its\r\nbrilliancy, reaching as it does through forty degrees of longitude,\r\nwhile none of its stars, except one, are above the third magnitude.\r\n_Menkar_ (_Alpha Ceti_) in the mouth, is a star of the second\r\nmagnitude; and several other bright stars, directly south of Aries, make\r\nthe head and neck of the Whale. _Mira_, (_Omicron Ceti_,) in the neck of\r\nthe Whale, is a variable star.\r\n\r\n_Orion_ is one of the largest and most beautiful of the constellations,\r\nlying southeast of Taurus. A cluster of small stars forms the head; two\r\nlarge stars, _Betalgeus_ of the first and _Bellatrix_ of the second\r\nmagnitude, make the shoulders; three more bright stars compose the\r\nbuckler, and three the sword; and _Rigel_, another star of the first\r\nmagnitude, makes one of the feet. In this constellation there are\r\nseventy stars plainly visible to the naked eye, including two of the\r\nfirst magnitude, four of the second, and three of the third.\r\n\r\n_Canis Major_ lies southeast of Orion, and is distinguished chiefly by\r\nits containing the largest of the fixed stars, _Sirius_.\r\n\r\n_Canis Minor_, a little north of the equator, between Canis Major and\r\nGemini, is a small constellation, consisting chiefly of two stars, of\r\nwhich, _Procyon_ is of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\n_Hydra_ has its head near Procyon, consisting of a number of stars of\r\nordinary brightness. About fifteen degrees southeast of the head is a\r\nstar of the second magnitude, forming the heart, (_Cor Hydræ_;) and\r\neastward of this is a long succession of stars of the fourth and fifth\r\nmagnitudes, composing the body and tail, and reaching a few degrees\r\nsouth of Spica Virginis.\r\n\r\n_Corvus_ (_the Crow_) is represented as standing on the tail of Hydra.\r\nIt consists of small stars, only three of which are as large as the\r\nthird magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn assigning the places of individual stars, I have not aimed at great\r\nprecision; but such a knowledge as you will acquire of the\r\nconstellations and larger stars, by nothing more even than you can\r\nobtain from the foregoing sketch, will not only add greatly to the\r\ninterest with which you will ever afterwards look at the starry heavens,\r\nbut it will enable you to locate any phenomenon that may present itself\r\nin the nocturnal sky, and to understand the position of any object that\r\nmay be described, by assigning its true place among the stars; although\r\nI hope you will go much further than this mere outline, in cultivating\r\nan actual acquaintance with the stars. Leaving, now, these great\r\ndivisions of the bodies of the firmament, let us ascend to the next\r\norder of stars, composing CLUSTERS.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of the nocturnal heavens are seen large groups which,\r\neither by the naked eye, or by the aid of the smallest telescope, are\r\nperceived to consist of a great number of small stars. Such are the\r\nPleiades, Coma Berenices, and Præsepe, or the Bee-hive, in Cancer. The\r\n_Pleiades_, or Seven Stars, as they are called, in the neck of Taurus,\r\nis the most conspicuous cluster. When we look _directly_ at this group,\r\nwe cannot distinguish more than six stars; but by turning the eye\r\n_sideways_ upon it, we discover that there are many more; for it is a\r\nremarkable fact that indirect vision is far more delicate than direct.\r\nThus we can see the zodiacal light or a comet's tail much more\r\ndistinctly and better defined, if we fix one eye on a part of the\r\nheavens at some distance and turn the other eye obliquely upon the\r\nobject, than we can by looking directly towards it. Telescopes show the\r\nPleiades to contain fifty or sixty stars, crowded together, and\r\napparently insulated from the other parts of the heavens. _Coma\r\nBerenices_ has fewer stars, but they are of a larger class than those\r\nwhich compose the Pleiades. The _Bee-hive_, or Nebula of Cancer, as it\r\nis called, is one of the finest objects of this kind for a small\r\ntelescope, being by its aid converted into a rich congeries of shining\r\npoints. The head of Orion affords an example of another cluster, though\r\nless remarkable than those already mentioned. These clusters are\r\npleasing objects to the telescope; and since a common spyglass will\r\nserve to give a distinct view of most of them, every one may have the\r\npower of taking the view. But we pass, now, to the third order of stars,\r\nwhich present themselves much more obscurely to the gaze of the\r\nastronomer, and require large instruments for the full developement\r\nof their wonderful organization. These are the NEBULÆ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Figures 70, 71, 72, 73. CLUSTERS OF STARS AND NEBULÆ.]\r\n\r\nNebulæ are faint misty appearances which are dimly seen among the stars,\r\nresembling comets, or a speck of fog. They are usually resolved by the\r\ntelescope into myriads of small stars; though in some instances, no\r\npowers of the telescope have been found sufficient thus to resolve them.\r\nThe _Galaxy_ or Milky Way, presents a continued succession of large\r\nnebulas. The telescope reveals to us innumerable objects of this kind.\r\nSir William Herschel has given catalogues of two thousand nebulæ, and\r\nhas shown that the nebulous matter is distributed through the immensity\r\nof space in quantities inconceivably great, and in separate parcels, of\r\nall shapes and sizes, and of all degrees of brightness between a mere\r\nmilky appearance and the condensed light of a fixed star. In fact, more\r\ndistinct nebulæ have been hunted out by the aid of telescopes than the\r\nwhole number of stars visible to the naked eye in a clear Winter's\r\nnight. Their appearances are extremely diversified. In many of them we\r\ncan easily distinguish the individual stars; in those apparently more\r\nremote, the interval between the stars diminishes, until it becomes\r\nquite imperceptible; and in their faintest aspect they dwindle to points\r\nso minute, as to be appropriately denominated _star-dust_. Beyond this,\r\nno stars are distinctly visible, but only streaks or patches of milky\r\nlight. The diagram facing page 379 represents a magnificent nebula in\r\nthe Galaxy. In objects so distant as the fixed stars, any apparent\r\ninterval must denote an immense space; and just imagine yourself\r\nsituated any where within the grand assemblage of stars, and a firmament\r\nwould expand itself over your head like that of our evening sky, only a\r\nthousand times more rich and splendid.\r\n\r\nMany of the nebulæ exhibit a tendency towards a globular form, and\r\nindicate a rapid condensation towards the centre. This characteristic is\r\nexhibited in the forms represented in Figs. 70 and 71. We have here two\r\nspecimens of nebulæ of the nearer class, where the stars are easily\r\ndiscriminated. In Figs. 72 and 73 we have examples of two others of the\r\nremoter kind, one of which is of the variety called _star-dust_. These\r\nwonderful objects, however, are not confined to the spherical form, but\r\nexhibit great varieties of figure. Sometimes they appear as ovals;\r\nsometimes they are shaped like a fan; and the unresolvable kind often\r\naffect the most fantastic forms. The opposite diagram, Fig. 74, as well\r\nas the preceding, affords a specimen of these varieties, as given in\r\nProfessor Nichols's 'Architecture of the Heavens,' where they are\r\nfaithfully copied from the papers of Herschel, in the 'Philosophical\r\nTransactions.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration Figure 74. VARIOUS FORMS OF NEBULÆ.]\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel has recently returned from a residence of five years\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope, with the express view of exploring the hidden\r\ntreasures of the southern hemisphere. The kinds of nebulæ are in general\r\nsimilar to those of the northern hemisphere, and the forms are equally\r\nvarious and singular. The _Magellan Clouds_, two remarkable objects seen\r\namong the stars of that hemisphere, and celebrated among navigators,\r\nappeared to the great telescope of Herschel (as we are informed by\r\nProfessor Nichols) no longer as simple milky spots, or permanent light\r\nflocculi of cloud, as they appear to the unassisted eye, but shone with\r\ninconceivable splendor. The _Nubecula Major_, as the larger object is\r\ncalled, is a congeries of clusters of stars, of irregular form, globular\r\nclusters and nebulæ of various magnitudes and degrees of condensation,\r\namong which is interspersed a large portion of irresolvable nebulous\r\nmatter, which may be, and probably is, star-dust, but which the power of\r\nthe twenty-feet telescope shows only as a general illumination of the\r\nfield of view, forming a bright ground on which the other objects are\r\nscattered. The _Nubecula Minor_ (the lesser cloud) exhibited appearances\r\nsimilar, though inferior in degree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Figure 75. A NEBULA IN THE MILKY WAY.]\r\n\r\nIt is a grand idea, first conceived by Sir William Herschel, and\r\ngenerally adopted by astronomers, that the whole Galaxy, or Milky Way,\r\nis nothing else than a nebula, and appears so extended, merely because\r\nit happens to be that particular nebula to which we belong. According to\r\nthis view, our sun, with his attendant planets and comets, constitutes\r\nbut a single star of the Galaxy, and our firmament of stars, or visible\r\nheavens, is composed of the stars of _our_ nebula alone. An inhabitant\r\nof any of the other nebulæ would see spreading over him a firmament\r\nequally spacious, and in some cases inconceivably more brilliant.\r\n\r\nIt is an exalted spectacle to travel over the Galaxy in a clear night,\r\nwith a powerful telescope, with the heart full of the idea that every\r\nstar is a world. Sir William Herschel, by counting the stars in a single\r\nfield of his telescope, estimated that fifty thousand had passed under\r\nhis review in a zone two degrees in breadth, during a single hour's\r\nobservation. Notwithstanding the apparent contiguity of the stars which\r\ncrowd the Galaxy, it is certain that their mutual distances must be\r\ninconceivably great.\r\n\r\nIt is with some reluctance that I leave, for the present, this fairy\r\nland of astronomy; but I must not omit, before bringing these Letters to\r\na conclusion, to tell you something respecting other curious and\r\ninteresting objects to be found among the stars.\r\n\r\nVARIABLE STARS are those which undergo a periodical change of\r\nbrightness. One of the most remarkable is the star _Mira_, in the Whale,\r\n(_Omicron Ceti_.) It appears once in eleven months, remains at its\r\ngreatest brightness about a fortnight, being then, on some occasions,\r\nequal to a star of the second magnitude. It then decreases about three\r\nmonths, until it becomes completely invisible, and remains so about five\r\nmonths, when it again becomes visible, and continues increasing during\r\nthe remaining three months of its period.\r\n\r\nAnother very remarkable variable star is _Algol_, (_Beta Persei_.) It is\r\nusually visible as a star of the second magnitude, and continues such\r\nfor two days and fourteen hours, when it suddenly begins to diminish in\r\nsplendor, and in about three and a half hours is reduced to the fourth\r\nmagnitude. It then begins again to increase, and in three and a half\r\nhours more is restored to its usual brightness, going through all its\r\nchanges in less than three days. This remarkable law of variation\r\nappears strongly to suggest the revolution round it of some opaque body,\r\nwhich, when interposed between us and Algol, cuts off a large portion of\r\nits light. \"It is,\" says Sir J. Herschel, \"an indication of a high\r\ndegree of activity in regions where, but for such evidences, we might\r\nconclude all lifeless. Our sun requires almost nine times this period to\r\nperform a revolution on its axis. On the other hand, the periodic time\r\nof an opaque revolving body, sufficiently large, which would produce a\r\nsimilar temporary obscuration of the sun, seen from a fixed star, would\r\nbe less than fourteen hours.\" The duration of these periods is extremely\r\nvarious. While that of Beta Persei, above mentioned, is less than three\r\ndays, others are more than a year; and others, many years.\r\n\r\nTEMPORARY STARS are new stars, which have appeared suddenly in the\r\nfirmament, and, after a certain interval, as suddenly disappeared, and\r\nreturned no more. It was the appearance of a new star of this kind, one\r\nhundred and twenty-five years before the Christian era, that prompted\r\nHipparchus to draw up a catalogue of the stars, the first on record.\r\nSuch, also, was the star which suddenly shone out, A.D. 389, in the\r\nEagle, as bright as Venus, and, after remaining three weeks, disappeared\r\nentirely. At other periods, at distant intervals, similar phenomena have\r\npresented themselves. Thus the appearance of a star in 1572 was so\r\nsudden, that Tycho Brahe, returning home one day, was surprised to find\r\na collection of country people gazing at a star which he was sure did\r\nnot exist half an hour before. It was then as bright as Sirius, and\r\ncontinued to increase until it surpassed Jupiter when brightest, and was\r\nvisible at mid-day. In a month it began to diminish; and, in three\r\nmonths afterwards, it had entirely disappeared. It has been supposed by\r\nsome that, in a few instances, the same star has returned, constituting\r\none of the periodical or variable stars of a long period. Moreover, on a\r\ncareful reexamination of the heavens, and a comparison of catalogues,\r\nmany stars are now discovered to be missing.\r\n\r\nDOUBLE STARS are those which appear single to the naked eye, but are\r\nresolved into two by the telescope; or, if not visible to the naked eye,\r\nare seen in the telescope so close together as to be recognised as\r\nobjects of this class. Sometimes, three or more stars are found in this\r\nnear connexion, constituting triple, or multiple stars. Castor, for\r\nexample, when seen by the naked eye, appears as a single star, but in a\r\ntelescope even of moderate powers, it is resolved into two stars, of\r\nbetween the third and fourth magnitudes, within five seconds of each\r\nother. These two stars are nearly of equal size; but more commonly, one\r\nis exceedingly small in comparison with the other, resembling a\r\nsatellite near its primary, although in distance, in light, and in other\r\ncharacteristics, each has all the attributes of a star, and the\r\ncombination, therefore, cannot be that of a planet with a satellite. In\r\nmost instances, also, the distance between these objects is much less\r\nthan five seconds; and, in many cases, it is less than one second. The\r\nextreme closeness, together with the exceeding minuteness, of most of\r\nthe double stars, requires the best telescopes united with the most\r\nacute powers of observation. Indeed, certain of these objects are\r\nregarded as the severest _tests_ both of the excellence of the\r\ninstruments and of the skill of the observer. The diagram on page 382,\r\nFig. 76, represents four double stars, as seen with appropriate\r\nmagnifiers. No. 1, exhibits Epsilon Bootis with a power of three hundred\r\nand fifty; No. 2, Rigel, with a power of one hundred and thirty; No. 3,\r\nthe Pole-star, with a power of one hundred; and No. 4, Castor, with a\r\npower of three hundred.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the double stars almost commenced with Sir William\r\nHerschel, about the year 1780. At the time he began his search for them,\r\nhe was acquainted with only _four_. Within five years he discovered\r\nnearly _seven hundred_ double stars, and during his life, he observed no\r\nless than twenty-four hundred. In his Memoirs, published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, he gave most accurate measurements of the\r\ndistances between the two stars, and of the angle which a line joining\r\nthe two formed with a circle parallel to the equator. These data would\r\nenable him, or at least posterity, to judge whether these minute bodies\r\never change their position with respect to each other. Since 1821, these\r\nresearches have been prosecuted, with great zeal and industry, by Sir\r\nJames South and Sir John Herschel, in England; while Professor Struve,\r\nof Dorpat, with the celebrated telescope of Fraunhofer, has published,\r\nfrom his own observations, a catalogue of three thousand double stars,\r\nthe determination of which involved the distinct and most minute\r\ninspection of at least one hundred and twenty thousand stars. Sir John\r\nHerschel, in his recent survey of the southern hemisphere, is said to\r\nhave added to the catalogue of double stars nearly three thousand more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 76.]\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances add a high degree of interest to the phenomena of\r\ndouble stars: the first is, that a few of them, at least, are found to\r\nhave a revolution around each other; the second, that they are supposed\r\nto afford the means of ascertaining the parallax of the fixed stars. But\r\nI must defer these topics till my next Letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nFIXED STARS CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n    \"O how canst thou renounce the boundless store\r\n    Of charms that Nature to her votary yields?\r\n    The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,\r\n    The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;\r\n    All that the genial ray of morning yields,\r\n    And all that echoes to the song of even,\r\n    All that the mountain's sheltering bosom shields,\r\n    And all the dread magnificence of heaven,--\r\n    O how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven!\"--_Beattie._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1803, Sir William Herschel first determined and announced to the\r\nworld, that there exist among the stars separate systems, composed of\r\ntwo stars revolving about each other in regular orbits. These he\r\ndenominated _binary stars_, to distinguish them from other double stars\r\nwhere no such motion is detected, and whose proximity to each other may\r\npossibly arise from casual juxtaposition, or from one being in the range\r\nof the other. Between fifty and sixty instances of changes, to a greater\r\nor less amount, of the relative positions of double stars, are mentioned\r\nby Sir William Herschel; and a few of them had changed their places so\r\nmuch, within twenty-five years, and in such order, as to lead him to the\r\nconclusion that they performed revolutions, one around the other, in\r\nregular orbits. These conclusions have been fully confirmed by later\r\nobservers; so that it is now considered as fully established, that there\r\nexist among the fixed stars binary systems, in which two stars perform\r\nto each other the office of sun and planet, and that the periods of\r\nrevolution of more than one such pair have been ascertained with some\r\ndegree of exactness. Immersions and emersions of stars behind each other\r\nhave been observed, and real motions among them detected, rapid enough\r\nto become sensible and measurable in very short intervals of time. The\r\nperiods of the double stars are very various, ranging, in the case of\r\nthose already ascertained, from forty-three years to one thousand.\r\nTheir orbits are very small ellipses, only a few seconds in the longest\r\ndirection, and more eccentric than those of the planets. A double star\r\nin the Northern Crown (_Eta Coronæ_) has made a complete revolution\r\nsince its first discovery, and is now far advanced in its second period;\r\nwhile a star in the Lion (_Gamma Leonis_) requires twelve hundred years\r\nto complete its circuit.\r\n\r\nYou may not at once see the reason why these revolutions of one member\r\nof a double star around the other, should be deemed facts of such\r\nextraordinary interest; to you they may appear rather in the light of\r\nastronomical curiosities. But remark, that the revolutions of the binary\r\nstars have assured us of this most interesting fact, that _the law of\r\ngravitation extends to the fixed stars_. Before these discoveries, we\r\ncould not decide, except by a feeble analogy, that this law transcended\r\nthe bounds of the solar system. Indeed, our belief of the fact rested\r\nmore upon our idea of unity of design in the works of the Creator, than\r\nupon any certain proof; but the revolution of one star around another,\r\nin obedience to forces which are proved to be similar to those which\r\ngovern the solar system, establishes the grand conclusion, that the law\r\nof gravitation is truly the law of the material universe. \"We have the\r\nsame evidence,\" says Sir John Herschel, \"of the revolutions of the\r\nbinary stars about each other, that we have of those of Saturn and\r\nUranus about the sun; and the correspondence between their calculated\r\nand observed places, in such elongated ellipses, must be admitted to\r\ncarry with it a proof of the prevalence of the Newtonian law of gravity\r\nin their systems, of the very same nature and cogency as that of the\r\ncalculated and observed places of comets round the centre of our own\r\nsystem. But it is not with the revolution of bodies of a cometary or\r\nplanetary nature round a solar centre, that we are now concerned; it is\r\nwith that of sun around sun, each, perhaps, accompanied with its train\r\nof planets and their satellites, closely shrouded from our view by the\r\nsplendor of their respective suns, and crowded into a space, bearing\r\nhardly a greater proportion to the enormous interval which separates\r\nthem, than the distances of the satellites of our planets from their\r\nprimaries bear to their distances from the sun itself.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the double stars are of different colors; and Sir John Herschel\r\nis of the opinion that there exist in nature suns of different colors.\r\n\"It may,\" says he, \"be easier suggested in words than conceived in\r\nimagination, what variety of illumination two suns, a red and a green,\r\nor a yellow and a blue one, must afford to a planet circulating about\r\neither; and what charming contrasts and 'grateful vicissitudes' a red\r\nand a green day, for instance, alternating with a white one and with\r\ndarkness, might arise from the presence or absence of one or other or\r\nboth above the horizon. Insulated stars of a red color, almost as deep\r\nas that of blood, occur in many parts of the heavens; but no green or\r\nblue star, of any decided hue, has ever been noticed unassociated with a\r\ncompanion brighter than itself.\"\r\n\r\nBeside these revolutions of the binary stars, _some of the fixed stars\r\nappear to have a real motion in space_. There are several _apparent_\r\nchanges of place among the stars, arising from real changes in the\r\nearth, which, as we are not conscious of them, we refer to the stars;\r\nbut there are other motions among the stars which cannot result from any\r\nchanges in the earth, but must arise from changes in the stars\r\nthemselves. Such motions are called the _proper motions_ of the stars.\r\nNearly two thousand years ago, Hipparchus and Ptolemy made the most\r\naccurate determinations in their power of the relative situations of the\r\nstars, and their observations have been transmitted to us in Ptolemy's\r\n'Almagest;' from which it appears that the stars retain at least _very\r\nnearly_ the same places now as they did at that period. Still, the more\r\naccurate methods of modern astronomers have brought to light minute\r\nchanges in the places of certain stars, which force upon us the\r\nconclusion, _either that our solar system causes an apparent\r\ndisplacement of certain stars, by a motion of its own in space, or\r\nthat they have themselves a proper motion_. Possibly, indeed, both these\r\ncauses may operate.\r\n\r\nIf the sun, and of course the earth which accompanies him, is actually\r\nin motion, the fact may become manifest from the apparent approach of\r\nthe stars in the region which he is leaving, and the recession of those\r\nwhich lie in the part of the heavens towards which he is travelling.\r\nWere two groves of trees situated on a plain at some distance apart, and\r\nwe should go from one to the other, the trees before us would gradually\r\nappear further and further asunder, while those we left behind would\r\nappear to approach each other. Some years since, Sir William Herschel\r\nsupposed he had detected changes of this kind among two sets of stars in\r\nopposite points of the heavens, and announced that the solar system was\r\nin motion towards a point in the constellation Hercules; but other\r\nastronomers have not found the changes in question such as would\r\ncorrespond to this motion, or to any motion of the sun; and, while it is\r\na matter of general belief that the sun has a motion in space, the fact\r\nis not considered as yet entirely proved.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, where a proper motion in certain stars has been\r\nsuspected, its annual amount has been so small, that many years are\r\nrequired to assure us, that the effect is not owing to some other cause\r\nthan a real progressive motion in the stars themselves; but in a few\r\ninstances the fact is too obvious to admit of any doubt. Thus, the two\r\nstars, 61 Cygni, which are nearly equal, have remained constantly at the\r\nsame or nearly at the same distance of fifteen seconds, for at least\r\nfifty years past. Mean-while, they have shifted their local situation in\r\nthe heavens four minutes twenty-three seconds, the annual proper motion\r\nof each star being five seconds and three tenths, by which quantity this\r\nsystem is every year carried along in some unknown path, by a motion\r\nwhich for many centuries must be regarded as uniform and rectilinear. A\r\ngreater proportion of the double stars than of any other indicate proper\r\nmotions, especially the binary stars, or those which have a revolution\r\naround each other. Among stars not double, and no way differing from the\r\nrest in any other obvious particular, a star in the constellation\r\nCassiopeia, (_Mu Cassiopeiæ_) has the greatest proper motion of any yet\r\nascertained, amounting to nearly four seconds annually.\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless heard much respecting the \"immeasurable _distances_\"\r\nof the fixed stars, and will desire to learn what is known to\r\nastronomers respecting this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nWe cannot ascertain the actual distance of any of the fixed stars, but\r\nwe can certainly determine that the nearest star is more than twenty\r\nmillions of millions of miles from the earth, (20,000,000,000,000.) For\r\nall measurements relating to the distances of the _sun and planets_, the\r\nradius of the earth furnishes the base line. The length of this line\r\nbeing known, and the horizontal parallax of the sun or any planet, we\r\nhave the means of calculating the distance of the body from us, by\r\nmethods explained in a previous Letter. But any star, viewed from the\r\nopposite sides of the earth, would appear from both stations to occupy\r\nprecisely the same situation in the celestial sphere, and of course it\r\nwould exhibit no horizontal parallax. But astronomers have endeavored to\r\nfind a parallax in some of the fixed stars, by taking the _diameter of\r\nthe earth's orbit_ as a base line. Yet even a change of position\r\namounting to one hundred and ninety millions of miles proved, until very\r\nrecently, insufficient to alter the place of a single star, so far as to\r\nbe capable of detection by very refined observations; from which it was\r\nconcluded that the stars have not even any _annual parallax_; that is,\r\nthe angle subtended by the semidiameter of the earth's orbit, at the\r\nnearest fixed star, is insensible. The errors to which instrumental\r\nmeasurements are subject, arising from the defects of instruments\r\nthemselves, from refraction, and from various other sources of\r\ninaccuracy, are such, that the angular determinations of arcs of the\r\nheavens cannot be relied on to less than one second, and therefore\r\ncannot be appreciated by direct measurement. It follows, that, when\r\nviewed from the nearest star, the diameter of the earth's orbit would be\r\ninsensible; the spider-line of the telescope would more than cover it.\r\nTaking, however, the annual parallax of a fixed star at one second, it\r\ncan be demonstrated, that the distance of the nearest fixed star _must\r\nexceed_ 95000000 × 200000 = 190000000 × 100000, or one hundred thousand\r\ntimes one hundred and ninety millions of miles. Of a distance so vast we\r\ncan form no adequate conceptions, and even seek to measure it only by\r\nthe time that light (which moves more than one hundred and ninety-two\r\nthousand miles per second, and passes from the sun to the earth in eight\r\nminutes and seven seconds) would take to traverse it, which is found to\r\nbe more than three and a half years.\r\n\r\nIf these conclusions are drawn with respect to the largest of the fixed\r\nstars, which we suppose to be vastly nearer to us than those of the\r\nsmallest magnitude, the idea of distance swells upon us when we attempt\r\nto estimate the remoteness of the latter. As it is uncertain, however,\r\nwhether the difference in the apparent magnitudes of the stars is owing\r\nto a real difference, or merely to their being at various distances from\r\nthe eye, more or less uncertainty must attend all efforts to determine\r\nthe relative distances of the stars; but astronomers generally believe,\r\nthat the lower orders of stars are vastly more distant from us than the\r\nhigher. Of some stars it is said, that thousands of years would be\r\nrequired for their light to travel down to us.\r\n\r\nI have said that the stars have always been held, until recently, to\r\nhave no annual parallax; yet it may be observed that astronomers were\r\nnot exactly agreed on this point. Dr. Brinkley, a late eminent Irish\r\nastronomer, supposed that he had detected an annual parallax in Alpha\r\nLyræ, amounting to one second and thirteen hundreths, and in Alpha\r\nAquilæ, of one second and forty-two hundreths. These results were\r\ncontroverted by Mr. Pond, of the Royal Observatory of Greenwich; and\r\nMr. Struve, of Dorpat, has shown that, in a number of cases, the\r\nsupposed parallax is in a direction opposite to that which would arise\r\nfrom the motion of the earth. Hence it is considered doubtful whether,\r\nin all cases of an apparent parallax, the effect is not wholly due to\r\nerrors of observation.\r\n\r\nBut as if nothing was to be hidden from our times, the long sought for\r\nparallax among the fixed stars has at length been found, and\r\nconsequently the distance of some of these bodies, at least, is no\r\nlonger veiled in mystery. In the year 1838, Professor Bessel, of\r\nKöningsberg, announced the discovery of a parallax in one of the stars\r\nof the Swan, (61 _Cygni_,) amounting to about _one third of a second_.\r\nThis seems, indeed, so small an angle, that we might have reason to\r\nsuspect the reality of the determination; but the most competent judges\r\nwho have thoroughly examined the process by which the discovery was\r\nmade, assent to its validity. What, then, do astronomers understand,\r\nwhen they say that a parallax has been discovered in one of the fixed\r\nstars, amounting to one third of a second? They mean that the star in\r\nquestion apparently shifts its place in the heavens, to that amount,\r\nwhen viewed at opposite extremities of the earth's orbit, namely, at\r\npoints in space distant from each other one hundred and ninety millions\r\nof miles. On calculating the distance of the star from us from these\r\ndata, it is found to be six hundred and fifty-seven thousand seven\r\nhundred times ninety-five millions of miles,--a distance which it would\r\ntake light more than ten years to traverse.\r\n\r\nIndirect methods have been proposed, for ascertaining the parallax of\r\nthe fixed stars, by means of observations on the _double stars_. If the\r\ntwo stars composing a double star are at different distances from us,\r\nparallax would affect them unequally, and change their relative\r\npositions with respect to each other; and since the ordinary sources of\r\nerror arising from the imperfection of instruments, from precession, and\r\nfrom refraction, would be avoided, (as they would affect both objects\r\nalike, and therefore would not disturb their relative positions,)\r\nmeasurements taken with the micrometer of changes much less than one\r\nsecond may be relied on. Sir John Herschel proposed a method, by which\r\nchanges may be determined that amount to only one fortieth of a second.\r\n\r\nThe immense distance of the fixed stars is inferred also from the fact,\r\nthat the largest telescopes do not increase their apparent magnitude.\r\nThey are still points, when viewed with glasses that magnify five\r\nthousand times.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the NATURE OF THE STARS, it would seem fruitless to\r\ninquire into the nature of bodies so distant, and which reveal\r\nthemselves to us only as shining points in space. Still, there are a few\r\nvery satisfactory inferences that can be made out respecting them.\r\nFirst, _the fixed stars are bodies greater than our earth_. If this were\r\nnot the case, they would not be visible at such an immense distance. Dr.\r\nWollaston, a distinguished English philosopher, attempted to estimate\r\nthe magnitudes of certain of the fixed stars from the light which they\r\nafford. By means of an accurate photometer, (an instrument for measuring\r\nthe relative intensities of light,) he compared the light of Sirius with\r\nthat of the sun. He next inquired how far the sun must be removed from\r\nus, in order to appear no brighter than Sirius. He found the distance to\r\nbe one hundred and forty-one thousand times its present distance. But\r\nSirius is more than two hundred thousand times as far off as the sun;\r\nhence he inferred that, upon the lowest computation, it must actually\r\ngive out twice as much light as the sun; or that, in point of splendor,\r\nSirius must be at least equal to two suns. Indeed, he has rendered it\r\nprobable, that its light is equal to that of fourteen suns. There is\r\nreason, however, to believe that the stars are actually of various\r\nmagnitudes, and that their apparent difference is not owing merely to\r\ntheir different distances. Bessel estimates the quantity of matter in\r\nthe two members of a double star in the Swan, as less than half that of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nSecondly, _the fixed stars are suns_. We have already seen that they are\r\nlarge bodies; that they are immensely further off than the furthest\r\nplanet; that they shine by their own light; in short, that their\r\nappearance is, in all respects, the same as the sun would exhibit if\r\nremoved to the region of the stars. Hence we infer that they are bodies\r\nof the same kind with the sun. We are justified, therefore, by a sound\r\nanalogy, in concluding that the stars were made for the same end as the\r\nsun, namely, as the centres of attraction to other planetary worlds, to\r\nwhich they severally dispense light and heat. Although the starry\r\nheavens present, in a clear night, a spectacle of unrivalled grandeur\r\nand beauty, yet it must be admitted that the chief purpose of the stars\r\ncould not have been to adorn the night, since by far the greater part of\r\nthem are invisible to the naked eye; nor as landmarks to the navigator,\r\nfor only a very small proportion of them are adapted to this purpose;\r\nnor, finally, to influence the earth by their attractions, since their\r\ndistance renders such an effect entirely insensible. If they are suns,\r\nand if they exert no important agencies upon our world, but are bodies\r\nevidently adapted to the same purpose as our sun, then it is as rational\r\nto suppose that they were made to give light and heat, as that the eye\r\nwas made for seeing and the ear for hearing. It is obvious to inquire,\r\nnext, to what they dispense these gifts, if not to planetary worlds; and\r\nwhy to planetary worlds, if not for the use of percipient beings? We are\r\nthus led, almost inevitably, to the idea of a _plurality of worlds_; and\r\nthe conclusion is forced upon us, that the spot which the Creator has\r\nassigned to us is but a humble province in his boundless empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXX.\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"O how unlike the complex works of man,\r\n    Heaven's easy, artless, unincumbered, plan.\"--_Cowper._\r\n\r\nHAVING now explained to you, as far as I am able to do it in so short a\r\nspace, the leading phenomena of the heavenly bodies, it only remains to\r\ninform you of the different systems of the world which have prevailed in\r\ndifferent ages,--a subject which will necessarily involve a sketch of\r\nthe history of astronomy.\r\n\r\nBy a system of the world, I understand an explanation of _the\r\narrangement of all the bodies that compose the material universe, and of\r\ntheir relations to each other_. It is otherwise called the 'Mechanism of\r\nthe Heavens;' and indeed, in the system of the world, we figure to\r\nourselves a machine, all parts of which have a mutual dependence, and\r\nconspire to one great end. \"The machines that were first invented,\" says\r\nAdam Smith, \"to perform any particular movement, are always the most\r\ncomplex; and succeeding artists generally discover that, with fewer\r\nwheels, and with fewer principles of motion, than had originally been\r\nemployed, the same effects may be more easily produced. The first\r\nsystems, in the same manner, are always the most complex; and a\r\nparticular connecting chain or principle is generally thought necessary,\r\nto unite every two seemingly disjointed appearances; but it often\r\nhappens, that _one great connecting principle_ is afterwards found to be\r\nsufficient to bind together all the discordant phenomena that occur in a\r\nwhole species of things!\" This remark is strikingly applicable to the\r\norigin and progress of systems of astronomy. It is a remarkable fact in\r\nthe history of the human mind, that astronomy is the oldest of the\r\nsciences, having been cultivated, with no small success, long before any\r\nattention was paid to the causes of the common terrestrial phenomena.\r\nThe opinion has always prevailed among those who were unenlightened by\r\nscience, that very extraordinary appearances in the sky, as comets,\r\nfiery meteors, and eclipses, are omens of the wrath of heaven. They\r\nhave, therefore, in all ages, been watched with the greatest attention:\r\nand their appearances have been minutely recorded by the historians of\r\nthe times. The idea, moreover, that the aspects of the stars are\r\nconnected with the destinies of individuals and of empires, has been\r\nremarkably prevalent from the earliest records of history down to a very\r\nlate period, and, indeed, still lingers among the uneducated and\r\ncredulous. This notion gave rise to ASTROLOGY,--an art which professed\r\nto be able, by a knowledge of the varying aspects of the planets and\r\nstars, to penetrate the veil of futurity, and to foretel approaching\r\nirregularities of Nature herself, and the fortunes of kingdoms and of\r\nindividuals. That department of astrology which took cognizance of\r\nextraordinary occurrences in the natural world, as tempests,\r\nearthquakes, eclipses, and volcanoes, both to predict their approach and\r\nto interpret their meaning, was called _natural astrology_: that which\r\nrelated to the fortunes of men and of empires, _judicial astrology_.\r\nAmong many ancient nations, astrologers were held in the highest\r\nestimation, and were kept near the persons of monarchs; and the practice\r\nof the art constituted a lucrative profession throughout the middle\r\nages. Nor were the ignorant and uneducated portions of society alone the\r\ndupes of its pretensions. Hippocrates, the 'Father of Medicine,' ranks\r\nastrology among the most important branches of knowledge to the\r\nphysician; and Tycho Brahe, and Lord Bacon, were firm believers in its\r\nmysteries. Astrology, fallacious as it was, must be acknowledged to have\r\nrendered the greatest services to astronomy, by leading to the accurate\r\nobservation and diligent study of the stars.\r\n\r\nAt a period of very remote antiquity, astronomy was cultivated in China,\r\nIndia, Chaldea, and Egypt. The Chaldeans were particularly\r\ndistinguished for the accuracy and extent of their astronomical\r\nobservations. Calisthenes, the Greek philosopher who accompanied\r\nAlexander the Great in his Eastern conquests, transmitted to Aristotle a\r\nseries of observations made at Babylon nineteen centuries before the\r\ncapture of that city by Alexander; and the wise men of Babylon and the\r\nChaldean astrologers are referred to in the Sacred Writings. They\r\nenjoyed a clear sky and a mild climate, and their pursuits as shepherds\r\nfavored long-continued observations; while the admiration and respect\r\naccorded to the profession, rendered it an object of still higher\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh century before the Christian era, astronomy began to be\r\ncultivated in Greece; and there arose successively three celebrated\r\nastronomical schools,--the school of Miletus, the school of Crotona, and\r\nthe school of Alexandria. The first was established by Thales, six\r\nhundred and forty years before Christ; the second, by Pythagoras, one\r\nhundred and forty years afterwards; and the third, by the Ptolemies of\r\nEgypt, about three hundred years before the Christian era. As Egypt and\r\nBabylon were renowned among the most ancient nations, for their\r\nknowledge of the sciences, long before they were cultivated in Greece,\r\nit was the practice of the Greeks, when they aspired to the character of\r\nphilosophers and sages, to resort to these countries to imbibe wisdom at\r\nits fountains. Thales, after extensive travels in Crete and Egypt,\r\nreturned to his native place, Miletus, a town on the coast of Asia\r\nMinor, where he established the first school of astronomy in Greece.\r\nAlthough the minds of these ancient astronomers were beclouded with much\r\nerror, yet Thales taught a few truths which do honor to his sagacity. He\r\nheld that the stars are formed of fire; that the moon receives her light\r\nfrom the sun, and is invisible at her conjunctions because she is hid in\r\nthe sun's rays. He taught the sphericity of the earth, but adopted the\r\ncommon error of placing it in the centre of the world. He introduced\r\nthe division of the sphere into five zones, and taught the obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic. He was acquainted with the Saros, or sacred period of the\r\nChaldeans, (see page 192,) and employed it in calculating eclipses. It\r\nwas Thales that predicted the famous eclipse of the sun which terminated\r\nthe war between the Lydians and the Medes, as mentioned in a former\r\nLetter. Indeed, Thales is universally regarded as a bright but solitary\r\nstar, glimmering through mists on the distant horizon.\r\n\r\nTo Thales succeeded, in the school of Miletus, two other astronomers of\r\nmuch celebrity, Anaximander and Anaxagoras. Among many absurd things\r\nheld by Anaximander, he first taught the sublime doctrine that the\r\nplanets are inhabited, and that the stars are suns of other systems.\r\nAnaxagoras attempted to explain all the secrets of the skies by natural\r\ncauses. His reasonings, indeed, were alloyed with many absurd notions;\r\nbut still he alone, among the astronomers, maintained the existence of\r\none God. His doctrines alarmed his countrymen, by their audacity and\r\nimpiety to their gods, whose prerogatives he was thought to invade; and,\r\nto deprecate their wrath, sentence of death was pronounced on the\r\nphilosopher and all his family,--a sentence which was commuted only for\r\nthe sad alternative of perpetual banishment. The very genius of the\r\nheathen mythology was at war with the truth. False in itself, it trained\r\nthe mind to the love of what was false in the interpretation of nature;\r\nit arrayed itself against the simplicity of truth, and persecuted and\r\nput to death its most ardent votaries. The religion of the Bible, on the\r\nother hand, lends all its aid to truth in nature as well as in morals\r\nand religion. In its very genius it inculcates and inspires the love of\r\ntruth; it suggests, by its analogies, the existence of established laws\r\nin the system of the world; and holds out the moon and the stars, which\r\nthe Creator has ordained, as fit objects to give us exalted views of his\r\nglory and wisdom.\r\n\r\nPythagoras was the founder of the celebrated school of Crotona. He was a\r\nnative of Samos, an island in the Ægean sea, and flourished about five\r\nhundred years before the Christian era. After travelling more than\r\nthirty years in Egypt and Chaldea, and spending several years more at\r\nSparta, to learn the laws and institutions of Lycurgus, he returned to\r\nhis native island to dispense the riches he had acquired to his\r\ncountrymen. But they, probably fearful of incurring the displeasure of\r\nthe gods by the freedom with which he inquired into the secrets of the\r\nskies, gave him so unwelcome a reception, that he retired from them, in\r\ndisgust, and established his school at Crotona, on the southeastern\r\ncoast of Italy. Hither, as to an oracle, the fame of his wisdom\r\nattracted hundreds of admiring pupils, whom he instructed in every\r\nspecies of knowledge. From the visionary notions which are generally\r\nunderstood to have been entertained on the subject of astronomy, by the\r\nancients, we are apt to imagine that they knew less than they actually\r\ndid of the truths of this science. But Pythagoras was acquainted with\r\nmany important facts in astronomy, and entertained many opinions\r\nrespecting the system of the world, which are now held to be true. Among\r\nother things well known to Pythagoras, either derived from his own\r\ninvestigations, or received from his predecessors, were the following;\r\nand we may note them as a synopsis of the state of astronomical\r\nknowledge at that age of the world. First, the principal\r\n_constellations_. These had begun to be formed in the earliest ages of\r\nthe world. Several of them, bearing the same name as at present, are\r\nmentioned in the writings of Hesiod and Homer; and the \"sweet influences\r\nof the Pleiades,\" and the \"bands of Orion,\" are beautifully alluded to\r\nin the book of Job. Secondly, _eclipses_. Pythagoras knew both the\r\ncauses of eclipses and how to predict them; not, indeed, in the accurate\r\nmanner now practised, but by means of the Saros. Thirdly, Pythagoras had\r\ndivined the true _system of the world_, holding that the sun, and not\r\nthe earth, (as was generally held by the ancients, even for many ages\r\nafter Pythagoras,) is the centre around which all the planets revolve;\r\nand that the stars are so many suns, each the centre of a system like\r\nour own. Among lesser things, he knew that the earth is round; that its\r\nsurface is naturally divided into five zones; and that the ecliptic is\r\ninclined to the equator. He also held that the earth revolves daily on\r\nits axis, and yearly around the sun; that the galaxy is an assemblage of\r\nsmall stars; and that it is the same luminary, namely, Venus, that\r\nconstitutes both the morning and evening star; whereas all the ancients\r\nbefore him had supposed that each was a separate planet, and accordingly\r\nthe morning star was called Lucifer, and the evening star, Hesperus. He\r\nheld, also, that the planets were inhabited, and even went so far as to\r\ncalculate the size of some of the animals in the moon. Pythagoras was\r\nalso so great an enthusiast in music, that he not only assigned to it a\r\nconspicuous place in his system of education, but even supposed that the\r\nheavenly bodies themselves were arranged at distances corresponding to\r\nthe intervals of the diatonic scale, and imagined them to pursue their\r\nsublime march to notes created by their own harmonious movements, called\r\nthe 'music of the spheres;' but he maintained that this celestial\r\nconcert, though loud and grand, is not audible to the feeble organs of\r\nman, but only to the gods. With few exceptions, however, the opinions of\r\nPythagoras on the system of the world were founded in truth. Yet they\r\nwere rejected by Aristotle, and by most succeeding astronomers, down to\r\nthe time of Copernicus; and in their place was substituted the doctrine\r\nof _crystalline spheres_, first taught by Eudoxus, who lived about three\r\nhundred and seventy years before Christ. According to this system, the\r\nheavenly bodies are set like gems in hollow solid orbs, composed of\r\ncrystal so transparent, that no anterior orb obstructs in the least the\r\nview of any of the orbs that lie behind it. The sun and the planets have\r\neach its separate orb; but the fixed stars are all set in the same\r\ngrand orb; and beyond this is another still, the _primum mobile_, which\r\nrevolves daily, from east to west, and carries along with it all the\r\nother orbs. Above the whole spreads the _grand empyrean_, or third\r\nheavens, the abode of perpetual serenity.\r\n\r\nTo account for the planetary motions, it was supposed that each of the\r\nplanetary orbs, as well as that of the sun, has a motion of its own,\r\neastward, while it partakes of the common diurnal motion of the starry\r\nsphere. Aristotle taught that these motions are effected by a tutelary\r\ngenius of each planet, residing in it, and directing its motions, as the\r\nmind of man directs his movements.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years after Pythagoras, arose the famous school of\r\nAlexandria, under the Ptolemies. These were a succession of Egyptian\r\nkings, and are not to be confounded with Ptolemy, the astronomer. By the\r\nmunificent patronage of this enlightened family, for the space of three\r\nhundred years, beginning at the death of Alexander the Great, from whom\r\nthe eldest of the Ptolemies had received his kingdom, the school of\r\nAlexandria concentrated in its vast library and princely halls, erected\r\nfor the accommodation of the philosophers, nearly all the science and\r\nlearning of the world. In wandering over the immense territories of\r\nignorance and barbarism which covered, at that time, almost the entire\r\nface of the earth, the eye reposes upon this little spot, as upon a\r\nverdant island in the midst of the desert. Among the choice fruits that\r\ngrew in this garden of astronomy were several of the most distinguished\r\nornaments of ancient science, of whom the most eminent were Hipparchus\r\nand Ptolemy. Hipparchus is justly considered as the Newton of antiquity.\r\nHe sought his knowledge of the heavenly bodies not in the illusory\r\nsuggestions of a fervid imagination, but in the vigorous application of\r\nan intellect of the first order. Previous to this period, celestial\r\nobservations were made chiefly with the naked eye: but Hipparchus was in\r\npossession of instruments for measuring angles, and knew how to resolve\r\nspherical triangles. These were great steps beyond all his predecessors.\r\nHe ascertained the length of the year within six minutes of the truth.\r\nHe discovered the eccentricity, or elliptical figure, of the solar\r\norbit, although he supposed the sun actually to move uniformly in a\r\ncircle, but the earth to be placed out of the centre. He also determined\r\nthe positions of the points among the stars where the earth is nearest\r\nto the sun, and where it is most remote from it. He formed very accurate\r\nestimates of the obliquity of the ecliptic and of the precession of the\r\nequinoxes. He computed the exact period of the synodic revolution of the\r\nmoon, and the inclination of the lunar orbit; discovered the backward\r\nmotion of her node and of her line of apsides; and made the first\r\nattempts to ascertain the horizontal parallaxes of the sun and moon.\r\nUpon the appearance of a new star in the firmament, he undertook, as\r\nalready mentioned, to number the stars, and to assign to each its true\r\nplace in the heavens, in order that posterity might have the means of\r\njudging what changes, if any, were going forward among these apparently\r\nunalterable bodies.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hipparchus is generally considered as belonging to the\r\nAlexandrian school, yet he lived at Rhodes, and there made his\r\nastronomical observations, about one hundred and forty years before the\r\nChristian era. One of his treatises has come down to us; but his\r\nprincipal discoveries have been transmitted through the 'Almagest' of\r\nPtolemy. Ptolemy flourished at Alexandria nearly three centuries after\r\nHipparchus, in the second century after Christ. His great work, the\r\n'Almagest,' which has conveyed to us most that we know respecting the\r\nastronomical knowledge of the ancients, was the universal text-book of\r\nastronomers for fourteen centuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration Fig. 77.]\r\n\r\nThe name of this celebrated astronomer has also descended to us,\r\nassociated with the system of the world which prevailed from Ptolemy to\r\nCopernicus, called the _Ptolemaic System_. The doctrines of the\r\nPtolemaic system did not originate with Ptolemy, but, being digested by\r\nhim out of materials furnished by various hands, it has come down to us\r\nunder the sanction of his name. According to this system, the earth is\r\nthe centre of the universe, and all the heavenly bodies daily revolve\r\naround it, from east to west. But although this hypothesis would account\r\nfor the apparent diurnal motion of the firmament, yet it would not\r\naccount for the apparent annual motion of the sun, nor for the slow\r\nmotions of the planets from west to east. In order to explain these\r\nphenomena, recourse was had to _deferents_ and _epicycles_,--an\r\nexplanation devised by Apollonius, one of the greatest geometers of\r\nantiquity. He conceived that, in the circumference of a circle, having\r\nthe earth for its centre, there moves the centre of a smaller circle in\r\nthe circumference of which the planet revolves. The circle surrounding\r\nthe earth was called the deferent, while the smaller circle, whose\r\ncentre was always in the circumference of the deferent, was called the\r\nepicycle. Thus, if E, Fig. 77, represents the earth, ABC will be the\r\ndeferent, and DFG, the epicycle; and it is obvious that the motion of a\r\nbody from west to east, in this small circle, would be alternately\r\ndirect, stationary, and retrograde, as was explained, in a previous\r\nLetter, to be actually the case with the apparent motions of the\r\nplanets. The hypothesis, however, is inconsistent with the _phases_ of\r\nMercury and Venus, which, being between us and the sun, on both sides of\r\nthe epicycle, would present their dark sides towards us at both\r\nconjunctions with the sun, whereas, at one of the conjunctions, it is\r\nknown that they exhibit their disks illuminated. It is, moreover, absurd\r\nto speak of a geometrical centre, which has no bodily existence, moving\r\nround the earth on the circumference of another circle. In addition to\r\nthese absurdities, the whole Ptolemaic system is encumbered with the\r\nfollowing difficulties: First, it is a mere hypothesis, having no\r\nevidence in its favor except that it explains the phenomena. This\r\nevidence is insufficient of itself, since it frequently happens that\r\neach of two hypotheses, which are directly opposite to each other, will\r\nexplain all the known phenomena. But the Ptolemaic system does not even\r\ndo this, as it is inconsistent with the phases of Mercury and Venus, as\r\nalready observed. Secondly, now that we are acquainted with the\r\ndistances of the remoter planets, and especially the fixed stars, the\r\nswiftness of motion, implied in a daily revolution of the starry\r\nfirmament around the earth, renders such a motion wholly incredible.\r\nThirdly, the centrifugal force which would be generated in these bodies,\r\nespecially in the sun, renders it impossible that they can continue to\r\nrevolve around the earth as a centre. Absurd, however, as the system of\r\nPtolemy was, for many centuries no great philosophic genius appeared to\r\nexpose its fallacies, and it therefore guided the faith of astronomers\r\nof all countries down to the time of Copernicus.\r\n\r\nAfter the age of Ptolemy, the science made little progress. With the\r\ndecline of Grecian liberty, the arts and sciences declined also; and the\r\nRomans, then masters of the world, were ever more ambitious to gain\r\nconquests over man than over matter; and they accordingly never produced\r\na single great astronomer. During the middle ages, the Arabians were\r\nalmost the only astronomers, and they cultivated this noble study\r\nchiefly as subsidiary to astrology.\r\n\r\nAt length, in the fifteenth century, Copernicus arose, and after forty\r\nyears of intense study and meditation, divined the true system of the\r\nworld. You will recollect that the Copernican system maintains, 1. That\r\nthe _apparent_ diurnal motions of the heavenly bodies, from east to\r\nwest, is owing to the _real_ revolution of the earth on its own axis\r\nfrom west to east; and, 2. That the sun is the centre around which the\r\nearth and planets all revolve from west to east. It rests on the\r\nfollowing arguments: In the first place, _the earth revolves on its own\r\naxis_. First, because this supposition is vastly more _simple_.\r\nSecondly, it is agreeable to _analogy_, since all the other planets that\r\nafford any means of determining the question, are seen to revolve on\r\ntheir axes. Thirdly, the _spheroidal figure_ of the earth is the figure\r\nof equilibrium, that results from a revolution on its axis. Fourthly,\r\nthe _diminished weight_ of bodies at the equator indicates a centrifugal\r\nforce arising from such a revolution. Fifthly, bodies let fall from a\r\nhigh eminence, fall _eastward of their base_, indicating that when\r\nfurther from the centre of the earth they were subject to a greater\r\nvelocity, which, in consequence of their inertia, they do not entirely\r\nlose in descending to the lower level.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, _the planets, including the earth, revolve about\r\nthe sun_. First, the _phases_ of Mercury and Venus are precisely such,\r\nas would result from their circulating around the sun in orbits within\r\nthat of the earth; but they are never seen in opposition, as they would\r\nbe, if they circulate around the earth. Secondly, the superior planets\r\ndo indeed revolve around the earth; but they also revolve around the\r\nsun, as is evident from their phases, and from the known dimensions of\r\ntheir orbits; and that the sun, and not the earth, is the _centre_ of\r\ntheir motions, is inferred from the greater symmetry of their motions,\r\nas referred to the sun, than as referred to the earth; and especially\r\nfrom the laws of gravitation, which forbid our supposing that bodies so\r\nmuch larger than the earth, as some of these bodies are, can circulate\r\npermanently around the earth, the latter remaining all the while at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the annual motion of _the earth_ itself is indicated\r\nalso by the most conclusive arguments. For, first, since all the\r\nplanets, with their satellites and the comets, revolve about the sun,\r\nanalogy leads us to infer the same respecting the earth and its\r\nsatellite, as those of Jupiter and Saturn, and indicates that it is a\r\nlaw of the solar system that the smaller bodies revolve about the\r\nlarger. Secondly, on the supposition that the earth performs an annual\r\nrevolution around the sun, it is embraced along with the planets, in\r\nKepler's law, that the squares of the times are as the cubes of the\r\ndistances; otherwise, it forms an exception, and the only known\r\nexception, to this law.\r\n\r\nSuch are the leading arguments upon which rests the Copernican system of\r\nastronomy. They were, however, only very partially known to Copernicus\r\nhimself, as the state both of mechanical science, and of astronomical\r\nobservation, was not then sufficiently matured to show him the strength\r\nof his own doctrine, since he knew nothing of the telescope, and nothing\r\nof the principle of universal gravitation. The evidence of this\r\nbeautiful system being left by Copernicus in so imperfect a state, and\r\nindeed his own reasonings in support of it being tinctured with some\r\nerrors, we need not so much wonder that Tycho Brahe, who immediately\r\nfollowed Copernicus, did not give it his assent, but, influenced by\r\ncertain passages of Scripture, he still maintained, with Ptolemy, that\r\nthe earth is in the centre of the universe; and he accounted for the\r\ndiurnal motions in the same manner as Ptolemy had done, namely, by an\r\nactual revolution of the whole host of heaven around the earth every\r\ntwenty-four hours. But he rejected the scheme of deferents and\r\nepicycles, and held that the moon revolves about the earth as the centre\r\nof her motions; but that the sun and not the earth is the centre of the\r\nplanetary motions; and that the sun, accompanied by the planets, moves\r\naround the earth once a year, somewhat in the manner in which we now\r\nconceive of Jupiter and his satellites as revolving around the sun. This\r\nsystem is liable to most of the objections that lie against the\r\nPtolemaic system, with the disadvantage of being more complex.\r\n\r\nKepler and Galileo, however, as appeared in the sketch of their lives,\r\nembraced the theory of Copernicus with great avidity, and all their\r\nlabors contributed to swell the evidence of its truth. When we see with\r\nwhat immense labor and difficulty the disciples of Ptolemy sought to\r\nreconcile every new phenomenon of the heavens with their system, and\r\nthen see how easily and naturally all the successive discoveries of\r\nGalileo and Kepler fall in with the theory of Copernicus, we feel the\r\nfull force of those beautiful lines of Cowper which I have chosen for\r\nthe motto of this Letter.\r\n\r\nNewton received the torch of truth from Galileo, and transmitted it to\r\nhis successors, with its light enlarged and purified; and since that\r\nperiod, every new discovery, whether the fruit of refined instrumental\r\nobservation or of profound mathematical analysis, has only added lustre\r\nto the glory of Copernicus.\r\n\r\nWith Newton commenced a new and wonderful era in astronomy,\r\ndistinguished above all others, not merely for the production of the\r\ngreatest of men, but also for the establishment of those most important\r\nauxiliaries to our science, the Royal Society of London, the Academy of\r\nSciences at Paris, and the Observatory of Greenwich. I may add the\r\ncommencement of the Transactions of the Royal Society, and the Memoirs\r\nof the Academy of Sciences, which have been continued to the present\r\ntime,--both precious storehouses of astronomical riches. The Observatory\r\nof Greenwich, moreover, has been under the direction of an extraordinary\r\nsuccession of great astronomers. Their names are Flamstead, Halley,\r\nBradley, Maskeleyne, Pond, and Airy,--the last being still at his post,\r\nand worthy of continuing a line so truly illustrious. The observations\r\naccumulated at this celebrated Observatory are so numerous, and so much\r\nsuperior to those of any other institution in the world, that it has\r\nbeen said that astronomy would suffer little, if all other contemporary\r\nobservations of the same kind were annihilated. Sir William Herschel,\r\nhowever, labored chiefly in a different sphere. The Astronomers Royal\r\ndevoted themselves not so much to the discovery of new objects among\r\nthe heavenly bodies, as to the exact determination of the places of the\r\nbodies already known, and to the developement of new laws or facts among\r\nthe celestial motions. But Herschel, having constructed telescopes of\r\nfar greater reach than any ever used before, employed them to sound new\r\nand untried depths in the profundities of space. We have already seen\r\nwhat interesting and amazing discoveries he made of double stars,\r\nclusters, and nebulæ.\r\n\r\nThe English have done most for astronomy in observation and discovery;\r\nbut the French and Germans, in developing, by the most profound\r\nmathematical investigation, the great laws of physical astronomy.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to inquire, whether the Copernican system is now to be\r\nregarded as a full exposition of the 'Mechanism of the Heavens,' or\r\nwhether there subsist higher orders of relations between the fixed stars\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe revolutions of the _binary stars_ afford conclusive evidence of at\r\nleast subordinate systems of suns, governed by the same laws as those\r\nwhich regulate the motions of the solar system. The _nebulæ_ also\r\ncompose peculiar systems, in which the members are evidently bound\r\ntogether by some common relation.\r\n\r\nIn these marks of organization,--of stars associated together in\r\nclusters; of sun revolving around sun; and of nebulæ disposed in regular\r\nfigures,--we recognise different members of some grand system, links in\r\none great chain that binds together all parts of the universe; as we see\r\nJupiter and his satellites combined in one subordinate system, and\r\nSaturn and his satellites in another,--each a vast kingdom, and both\r\nuniting with a number of other individual parts, to compose an empire\r\nstill more vast.\r\n\r\nThis fact being now established, that the stars are immense bodies, like\r\nthe sun, and that they are subject to the laws of gravitation, we cannot\r\nconceive how they can be preserved from falling into final disorder and\r\nruin, unless they move in harmonious concert, like the members of the\r\nsolar system. Otherwise, those that are situated on the confines of\r\ncreation, being retained by no forces from without, while they are\r\nsubject to the attraction of all the bodies within, must leave their\r\nstations, and move inward with accelerated velocity; and thus all the\r\nbodies in the universe would at length fall together in the common\r\ncentre of gravity. The immense distance at which the stars are placed\r\nfrom each other would indeed delay such a catastrophe; but this must be\r\nthe ultimate tendency of the material world, unless sustained in one\r\nharmonious system by nicely-adjusted motions. To leave entirely out of\r\nview our confidence in the wisdom and preserving goodness of the\r\nCreator, and reasoning merely from what we know of the stability of the\r\nsolar system, we should be justified in inferring, that other worlds are\r\nnot subject to forces which operate only to hasten their decay, and to\r\ninvolve them in final ruin.\r\n\r\nWe conclude, therefore, that the material universe is one great system;\r\nthat the combination of planets with their satellites constitutes the\r\nfirst or lowest order of worlds; that next to these, planets are linked\r\nto suns; that these are bound to other suns, composing a still higher\r\norder in the scale of being; and finally, that all the different systems\r\nof worlds move around their common centre of gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nNATURAL THEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n           ----\"Philosophy, baptized\r\n    In the pure fountain of Eternal Love,\r\n    Has eyes indeed; and, viewing all she sees\r\n    As meant to indicate a God to man,\r\n    Gives Him the praise, and forfeits not her own.\"--_Cowper._\r\n\r\n\r\nI INTENDED, my dear Friend, to comply with your request \"that I would\r\ndiscuss the arguments which astronomy affords to natural theology;\" but\r\nthese Letters have been already extended so much further than I\r\nanticipated, that I shall conclude with suggesting a few of those moral\r\nand religious reflections, which ought always to follow in the train of\r\nsuch a survey of the heavenly bodies as we have now taken.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is evidence enough in the structure, arrangement, and\r\nlaws, which prevail among the heavenly bodies, to prove the _existence_\r\nof God, yet I think there are many subordinate parts of His works far\r\nbetter adapted to this purpose than these, being more fully within our\r\ncomprehension. It was intended, no doubt, that the evidence of His being\r\nshould be accessible to all His creatures, and should not depend on a\r\nkind of knowledge possessed by comparatively few. The mechanism of the\r\neye is probably not more perfect than that of the universe; but we can\r\nanalyze it better, and more fully understand the design of each part.\r\nBut the existence of God being once proved, and it being admitted that\r\nHe is the Creator and Governor of the world, then the discoveries of\r\nastronomy are admirably adapted to perform just that office in relation\r\nto the Great First Cause, which is assigned to them in the Bible,\r\nnamely, \"to declare the glory of God, and to show His handiwork.\" In\r\nother words, the discoveries of astronomy are peculiarly fitted,--more\r\nso, perhaps, than any other department of creation,--to exhibit the\r\nunity, power, and wisdom, of the Creator.\r\n\r\nThe most modern discoveries have multiplied the proofs of the _unity_ of\r\nGod. It has usually been offered as sufficient evidence of the truth of\r\nthis doctrine, that the laws of Nature are found to be uniform when\r\napplied to the utmost bounds of the _solar system_; that the law of\r\ngravitation controls alike the motions of Mercury, and those of Uranus;\r\nand that its operation is one and the same upon the moon and upon the\r\nsatellites of Saturn. It was, however, impossible, until recently, to\r\npredicate the same uniformity in the great laws of the universe\r\nrespecting the starry worlds, except by a feeble analogy. However\r\nimprobable, it was still possible, that in these distant worlds other\r\nlaws might prevail, and other Lords exercise dominion. But the discovery\r\nof the revolutions of the binary stars, in exact accordance with the law\r\nof gravitation, not merely in a single instance, but in many instances,\r\nin all cases, indeed, wherever those revolutions have advanced so far as\r\nto determine their law of action, gives us demonstration, instead of\r\nanalogy, of the prevalence of the same law among the other systems as\r\nthat which rules in ours.\r\n\r\nThe marks of a still higher organization in the structure of clusters\r\nand nebulæ, all bearing that same characteristic union of resemblance\r\nand variety which belongs to all the other works of creation that fall\r\nunder our notice, speak loudly of one, and only one, grand design. Every\r\nnew discovery of the telescope, therefore, has added new proofs to the\r\ngreat truth that God is one: nor, so far as I know, has a single fact\r\nappeared, that is not entirely consonant with it. Light, moreover, which\r\nbrings us intelligence, and, in most cases, the only intelligence we\r\nhave, of these remote orbs, testifies to the same truth, being similar\r\nin its properties and uniform in its motions, from whatever star it\r\nemanates.\r\n\r\nIn displays of the _power_ of Jehovah, nothing can compare with the\r\nstarry heavens. The magnitudes, distances, and velocities, of the\r\nheavenly bodies are so much beyond every thing of this kind which\r\nbelongs to things around us, from which we borrowed our first ideas of\r\nthese qualities, that we can scarcely avoid looking with incredulity at\r\nthe numerical results to which the unerring principles of mathematics\r\nhave conducted us. And when we attempt to apply our measures to the\r\nfixed stars, and especially to the nebulæ, the result is absolutely\r\noverwhelming: the mind refuses its aid in our attempts to grasp the\r\ngreat ideas. Nor less conspicuous, among the phenomena of the heavenly\r\nbodies, is the _wisdom_ of the Creator. In the first place, this\r\nattribute is every where exhibited _in the happy adaptation of means to\r\ntheir ends_. No principle can be imagined more simple, and at the same\r\ntime more effectual to answer the purposes which it serves, than\r\ngravitation. No position can be given to the sun and planets so fitted,\r\nas far as we can judge, to fulfil their mutual relations, as that which\r\nthe Creator has given them. I say, as far as we can judge; for we find\r\nthis to be the case in respect to our own planet and its attendant\r\nsatellite, and hence have reason to infer that the same is the case in\r\nthe other planets, evidently holding, as they do, a similar relation to\r\nthe sun. Thus the position of the earth at just such a distance from the\r\nsun as suits the nature of its animal and vegetable kingdoms, and\r\nconfining the range of solar heat, vast as it might easily become,\r\nwithin such narrow bounds; the inclination of the earth's axis to the\r\nplane of its orbit, so as to produce the agreeable vicissitudes of the\r\nseasons, and increase the varieties of animal and vegetable life, still\r\nconfining the degree of inclination so exactly within the bounds of\r\nsafety, that, were it much to transcend its present limits, the changes\r\nof temperature of the different seasons would be too sudden and violent\r\nfor the existence of either animals or vegetables; the revolution of the\r\nearth on its axis, so happily dividing time into hours of business and\r\nof repose; the adaptation of the moon to the earth, so as to afford to\r\nus her greatest amount of light just at the times when it is needed\r\nmost, and giving to the moon just such a quantity of matter, and placing\r\nher at just such a distance from the earth, as serves to raise a tide\r\nproductive of every conceivable advantage, without the evils which would\r\nresult from a stagnation of the waters on the one hand, or from their\r\noverflow on the other;--these are a few examples of the wisdom displayed\r\nin the mutual relations instituted between the sun, the earth, and the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, similar marks of wisdom are exhibited in _the many\r\nuseful and important purposes_ _which the same thing is made to serve_.\r\nThus the sun is at once the great regulator of the planetary motions,\r\nand the fountain of light and heat. The moon both gives light by night\r\nand raises the tides. Or, if we would follow out this principle where\r\nits operations are more within our comprehension, we may instance the\r\n_atmosphere_. When man constructs an instrument, he deems it sufficient\r\nif it fulfils one single purpose as the watch, to tell the hour of the\r\nday, or the telescope, to enable him to see distant objects; and had a\r\nbeing like ourselves made the atmosphere, he would have thought it\r\nenough to have created a medium so essential to animal life, that to\r\nlive is to breathe, and to cease to breathe is to die. But beside this,\r\nthe atmosphere has manifold uses, each entirely distinct from all the\r\nothers. It conveys to plants, as well as animals, their nourishment and\r\nlife; it tempers the heat of Summer with its breezes; it binds down all\r\nfluids, and prevents their passing into the state of vapor; it supports\r\nthe clouds, distils the dew, and waters the earth with showers; it\r\nmultiplies the light of the sun, and diffuses it over earth and sky; it\r\nfeeds our fires, turns our machines, wafts our ships, and conveys to the\r\near all the sentiments of language, and all the melodies of music.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the wisdom of the Creator is strikingly manifested\r\nin the provision he has made for the _stability of the universe_. The\r\nperturbations occasioned by the motions of the planets, from their\r\naction on each other, are very numerous, since every body in the system\r\nexerts an attraction on every other, in conformity with the law of\r\nuniversal gravitation. Venus and Mercury, approaching, as they do at\r\ntimes, comparatively near to the earth, sensibly disturb its motions;\r\nand the satellites of the remoter planets greatly disturb each other's\r\nmovements. Nor was it possible to endow this principle with the\r\nproperties it has, and make it operate as it does in regulating the\r\nmotions of the world, without involving such an incident. On this\r\nsubject, Professor Whewell, in his excellent work composing one of the\r\nBridgewater Treatises, remarks: \"The derangement which the planets\r\nproduce in the motion of one of their number will be very small, in the\r\ncourse of one revolution; but this gives us no security that the\r\nderangement may not become very large, in the course of many\r\nrevolutions. The cause acts perpetually, and it has the whole extent of\r\ntime to work in. Is it not easily conceivable, then, that, in the lapse\r\nof ages, the derangements of the motions of the planets may accumulate,\r\nthe orbits may change their form, and their mutual distances may be much\r\nincreased or diminished? Is it not possible that these changes may go on\r\nwithout limit, and end in the complete subversion and ruin of the\r\nsystem? If, for instance, the result of this mutual gravitation should\r\nbe to increase considerably the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, or to\r\nmake the moon approach continually nearer and nearer to the earth, at\r\nevery revolution, it is easy to see that, in the one case, our year\r\nwould change its character, producing a far greater irregularity in the\r\ndistribution of the solar heat; in the other, our satellite must fall to\r\nthe earth, occasioning a dreadful catastrophe. If the positions of the\r\nplanetary orbits, with respect to that of the earth, were to change\r\nmuch, the planets might sometimes come very near us, and thus increase\r\nthe effect of their attraction beyond calculable limits. Under such\r\ncircumstances, 'we might have years of unequal length, and seasons of\r\ncapricious temperature; planets and moons, of portentous size and\r\naspect, glaring and disappearing at uncertain intervals; tides, like\r\ndeluges, sweeping over whole continents; and perhaps the collision of\r\ntwo of the planets, and the consequent destruction of all organization\r\non both of them.' The fact really is, that changes are taking place in\r\nthe motions of the heavenly bodies, which have gone on progressively,\r\nfrom the first dawn of science. The eccentricity of the earth's orbit\r\nhas been diminishing from the earliest observations to our times. The\r\nmoon has been moving quicker from the time of the first recorded\r\neclipses, and is now in advance, by about four times her own breadth,\r\nof what her own place would have been, if it had not been affected by\r\nthis acceleration. The obliquity of the ecliptic, also, is in a state of\r\ndiminution, and is now about two fifths of a degree less than it was in\r\nthe time of Aristotle.\"\r\n\r\nBut amid so many seeming causes of irregularity and ruin, it is worthy\r\nof a grateful notice, that effectual provision is made for the\r\n_stability of the solar system_. The full confirmation of this fact is\r\namong the grand results of physical astronomy. \"Newton did not undertake\r\nto demonstrate either the stability or instability of the system. The\r\ndecision of this point required a great number of preparatory steps and\r\nsimplifications, and such progress in the invention and improvement of\r\nmathematical methods, as occupied the best mathematicians of Europe for\r\nthe greater part of the last century. Towards the end of that time, it\r\nwas shown by La Grange and La Place, that the arrangements of the solar\r\nsystem are stable; that, in the long run, the orbits and motions remain\r\nunchanged; and that the changes in the orbits, which take place in\r\nshorter periods, never transgress certain very moderate limits. Each\r\norbit undergoes deviations on this side and on that side of its average\r\nstate; but these deviations are never very great, and it finally\r\nrecovers from them, so that the average is preserved. The planets\r\nproduce perpetual perturbations in each other's motions; but these\r\nperturbations are not indefinitely progressive, but periodical, reaching\r\na maximum value, and then diminishing. The periods which this\r\nrestoration requires are, for the most part, enormous,--not less than\r\nthousands, and in some instances, millions, of years. Indeed, some of\r\nthese apparent derangements have been going on in the same direction\r\nfrom the creation of the world. But the restoration is in the sequel as\r\ncomplete as the derangement; and in the mean time the disturbance never\r\nattains a sufficient amount seriously to affect the stability of the\r\nsystem. 'I have succeeded in demonstrating,' says La Place, 'that,\r\nwhatever be the masses of the planets, in consequence of the fact that\r\nthey all move in the same direction, in orbits of small eccentricity,\r\nand but slightly inclined to each other, their secular irregularities\r\nare periodical, and included within narrow limits; so that the planetary\r\nsystem will only oscillate about a mean state, and will never deviate\r\nfrom it, except by a very small quantity. The ellipses of the planets\r\nhave been and always will be nearly circular. The ecliptic will never\r\ncoincide with the equator; and the entire extent of the variation, in\r\nits inclination, cannot exceed three degrees.'\"\r\n\r\nTo these observations of La Place, Professor Whewell adds the following,\r\non the importance, to the stability of the solar system, of the fact\r\nthat those planets which have _great masses_ have orbits of _small\r\neccentricity_. \"The planets Mercury and Mars, which have much the\r\nlargest eccentricity among the old planets, are those of which the\r\nmasses are much the smallest. The mass of Jupiter is more than two\r\nthousand times that of either of these planets. If the orbit of Jupiter\r\nwere as eccentric as that of Mercury, all the security for the stability\r\nof the system, which analysis has yet pointed out, would disappear. The\r\nearth and the smaller planets might, by the near approach of Jupiter at\r\nhis perihelion, change their nearly circular orbits into very long\r\nellipses, and thus might fall into the sun, or fly off into remoter\r\nspace. It is further remarkable, that in the newly-discovered planets,\r\nof which the orbits are still more eccentric than that of Mercury, the\r\nmasses are still smaller, so that the same provision is established in\r\nthis case, also.\"\r\n\r\nWith this hasty glance at the unity, power, and wisdom, of the Creator,\r\nas manifested in the greatest of His works, I close. I hope enough has\r\nbeen said to vindicate the sentiment that called 'Devotion, daughter of\r\nAstronomy!' I do not pretend that this, or any other science, is\r\nadequate of itself to purify the heart, or to raise it to its Maker; but\r\nI fully believe that, when the heart is already under the power of\r\nreligion, there is something in the frequent and habitual contemplation\r\nof the heavenly bodies under all the lights of modern astronomy, very\r\nfavorable to devotional feelings, inspiring, as it does, humility, in\r\nunison with an exalted sentiment of grateful adoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nRECENT DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\n    \"All are but parts of one stupendous whole.\"--_Pope._\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHIN a few years, astronomy has been enriched with a number of\r\nvaluable discoveries, of which I will endeavor to give you a summary\r\naccount in this letter. The heavens have been explored with far more\r\npowerful telescopes than before; instrumental measurements have been\r\ncarried to an astonishing degree of accuracy; numerous additions have\r\nbeen made to the list of small planets or asteroids; a comet has\r\nappeared of extraordinary splendor, remarkable, above all others, for\r\nits near approach to the sun; the distances of several of the fixed\r\nstars, an element long sought for in vain, have been determined; a large\r\nplanet, composing in itself a magnificent world, has been added to the\r\nsolar system, at such a distance from the central luminary as nearly to\r\ndouble the supposed dimensions of that system; various nebulæ, before\r\nheld to be irresolvable, have been resolved into stars; and a new\r\nsatellite has been added to Saturn.\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS IN THE TELESCOPE.--Herschel's forty-feet telescope, of\r\nwhich I gave an account in my fourth letter (see page 36), remained for\r\nhalf a century unequalled in magnitude and power; but in 1842, Lord\r\nRosse, an Irish nobleman, commenced a telescope on a scale still more\r\ngigantic. Like Herschel's, it was a _reflector_, the image being formed\r\nby a concave mirror. This was six feet in diameter, and weighed three\r\ntons; and the tube was fifty feet in length. The entire cost of the\r\ninstrument was sixty thousand dollars. Its reflecting surface is nearly\r\ntwice as great as the great Herschelian, and consequently it greatly\r\nexceeds all instruments hitherto constructed in the _amount of light_\r\nwhich it collects and transmits to the eye; and this adapts it\r\npeculiarly to viewing those objects, as nebulæ, whose light is\r\nexceedingly faint. Accordingly, it has revealed to us new wonders in\r\nthis curious department of astronomy. Some idea of the great dimensions\r\nof the _Leviathan_ telescope (as this instrument has been called) may be\r\nformed when it is said that the Dean of Ely, a full-sized man, walked\r\nthrough the tube from one end to the other, with an umbrella over his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nBut still greater advances have been made in refracting than in\r\nreflecting telescopes. Such was the difficulty of obtaining large pieces\r\nof glass which are free from impurities, and such the liability of large\r\nlenses to form obscure and colored images, that it was formerly supposed\r\nimpossible to make a refracting telescope larger in diameter than five\r\nor six inches; but their size has been increased from one step to\r\nanother, until they are now made more than fifteen inches in diameter;\r\nand so completely have all the difficulties arising from the\r\nimperfections of glass, and from optical defects inherent in lenses,\r\nbeen surmounted, that the great telescopes of Pulkova, at St.\r\nPetersburgh, and of Harvard University (the two finest refractors in the\r\nworld) are considered among the most perfect productions of the arts. A\r\nlens of only 15 inches in diameter seems, indeed, diminutive when\r\ncompared with a concave reflector of six feet; but for most purposes of\r\nthe astronomer, the Pulkova and Cambridge instruments are more useful\r\nthan such great reflectors as those of Herschel and Rosse. If there is\r\nany particular in which these are more effective, it is in observations\r\non the faintest nebulæ, where it is necessary to collect and convey to\r\nthe eye the greatest possible beam of light.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTAL MEASUREMENTS.--When astronomical instruments were first\r\nemployed to measure the angular distance between two points on the\r\ncelestial sphere, it was not attempted to measure spaces smaller than\r\nten minutes--a space equal to the third part of the breadth of the full\r\nmoon. Tycho Brahe, however, carried his measures to sixty times that\r\ndegree of minuteness, having devised means of determining angles no\r\nlarger than ten seconds, or the one hundred and eightieth part of the\r\nbreadth of the lunar disk. For many years past, astronomers have carried\r\nthese measures to single seconds, or have determined spaces no greater\r\nthan the eighteen hundredth part of the diameter of the moon. This is\r\nconsidered the smallest arc which can be accurately measured directly on\r\nthe limb of an instrument; but _differences_ between spaces may be\r\nestimated to a far greater degree of accuracy than this, even to the\r\nhundredth part of a second--a space less than that intercepted by a\r\nspider's web held before the eye.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF NEW PLANETS.--In my twenty-third letter (see page 286), I\r\ngave an account of the small planets called asteroids, which lie between\r\nthe orbits of Mars and Jupiter. When that letter was written, no longer\r\nago than 1840, only four of those bodies had been discovered, namely,\r\nCeres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta. Within a few years past, nineteen more\r\nhave been added, making the number of the asteroids known at present\r\ntwenty-three, and every year adds one or more to the list.[17] The idea\r\nfirst suggested by Olbers, one of the earliest discoverers of asteroids,\r\nthat they are fragments of a large single planet once revolving between\r\nMars and Jupiter, has gained credit since the discovery of so many\r\nadditional bodies of the same class, all, like the former, exceedingly\r\nsmall and irregular in their motions, although there are still great\r\ndifficulties in tracing them to a common origin.\r\n\r\nGREAT COMET OF 1843.--This is the most wonderful body that has appeared\r\nin the heavens in modern times; first, on account of its appearing, when\r\nfirst seen, in the broad light of noonday; and, secondly, on account of\r\nits approaching so near the sun as almost to graze his surface. It was\r\nfirst discovered, in New England, on the 28th of February, a little\r\neastward of the sun, shining like a white cloud illuminated by the solar\r\nrays. It arrested the attention of many individuals from half past seven\r\nin the morning until three o'clock in the afternoon, when the sky became\r\nobscured by clouds. In Mexico, it was observed from nine in the morning\r\nuntil sunset. At a single station in South America, it was said to have\r\nbeen seen on the 27th of February, almost in contact with the sun. Early\r\nin March, it had receded so far to the eastward of that body as to be\r\nvisible in the southwest after sunset, throwing upward a long train,\r\nwhich increased in length from night to night until it covered a space\r\nof 40 degrees. Its position may be seen on a celestial globe adjusted to\r\nthe latitude of New Haven (41° 18´) for the 20th of March, by tracing a\r\nline, or, rather, a broad band proceeding from the place of the sun\r\ntowards the bright star Sirius, in the south, between the ears of the\r\nHare and the feet of Orion.\r\n\r\nThe comet passed its perihelion on the 27th of February, at which time\r\nit almost came in contact with the sun. To prevent its falling into the\r\nsun it was endued with a prodigious velocity; a velocity so great that,\r\nhad it continued at the same rate as at the instant of perihelion\r\npassage, it would have whirled round the sun in two hours and a half. It\r\ndid, in fact, complete more than half its revolution around the sun in\r\nthat short period, and it made more than three quarters of its circuit\r\naround the sun in one day. Its velocity, when nearest the sun, exceeded\r\na million of miles per hour, and its tail, at its greatest elongation,\r\nwas one hundred and eight millions of miles; a length more than\r\nsufficient to have reached from the sun to the earth. Its heat was\r\nestimated to be 47,000 times greater than that received by the earth\r\nfrom a vertical sun, and consequently it was more intense than that\r\nproduced by the most powerful blowpipes, and sufficient to melt like wax\r\nthe most infusible bodies. No doubt, when in the vicinity of the sun,\r\nthe solid matter of the comet was first melted and then converted into\r\nvapor, which itself became red hot, or, more properly speaking, _white\r\nhot_. Much discussion has arisen among astronomers respecting the\r\nperiodic time of this comet. Its most probable period is about 175\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nDISTANCES OF THE STARS.--I have already mentioned (page 389) that the\r\ndistance of at least one of the fixed stars has at length been\r\ndetermined, although at so great a distance that its annual parallax is\r\nonly about one third of a second, implying a distance from the sun of\r\nnearly sixty millions of millions of miles. Of a distance so immense the\r\nmind can form no adequate conception. The most successful effort towards\r\nit is made by gradual and successive approximations. Let us, therefore,\r\ntake the motion of a rail-way car as the most rapid with which we are\r\nfamiliar, and apply it first to the planetary spaces, and then to the\r\nvast interval that separates these nether worlds from the fixed stars. A\r\nrail-way car, travelling constantly night and day at the rate of twenty\r\nmiles per hour, would make 480 miles per day. At this rate, to travel\r\naround the earth on a great circle would require about 50 days, and 500\r\ndays to reach the moon. If we took our departure from the sun, and\r\njourneyed night and day, we should reach Mercury in a little more than\r\n200 years, Venus in nearly 400, and the Earth in 547 years; but to reach\r\nNeptune, the outermost planet, would require 16,000 years. Great as\r\nappear the dimensions of the solar system, when we imagine ourselves\r\nthus borne along from world to world, yet this space is small compared\r\nwith that which separates us from the fixed stars; for to reach 61 Cygni\r\nit would take 324,000,000 years. But this is believed, for certain\r\nsatisfactory reasons, to be one of the nearest of the stars. Several\r\nother stars whose parallax has been determined are at a much greater\r\ndistance than 61 Cygni. The pole star is five times as far off; and the\r\ngreater part of the stars are at distances inconceivably more remote.\r\nSuch, especially, are those which compose the faintest nebulæ.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE PLANET NEPTUNE.--From the earliest ages down to the\r\nyear 1781, the solar system was supposed to terminate with the planet\r\nSaturn, at the distance of nine hundred millions of miles from the sun;\r\nbut the discovery of Uranus added another world, and doubled the\r\ndimensions of the solar system. It seemed improbable that any more\r\nplanets should exist at a distance still more remote, since such a body\r\ncould hardly receive any of the vivifying influences of the central\r\nluminary. Still, certain irregularities to which the Uranus was subject,\r\nled to the suspicion that there exists a planet beyond it, which, by its\r\nattractions, caused these irregularities. Impressed with this belief,\r\ntwo young astronomers of great genius, Le Verrier, of France, and Adams,\r\nof England, applied themselves to the task of finding the hidden planet.\r\nThe direction in which the disturbed body was moved afforded some clue\r\nto the part of the heavens where the disturbing body lay concealed; the\r\nkind of action it excited at different times indicated that it was\r\nbeyond Uranus, and not this side of that planet; and the magnitude of\r\nthe forces it exerted gave some intimation of its size and mass. The law\r\nof distances from the sun which the superior planets observe (Saturn\r\nbeing nearly twice the distance of Jupiter, and Uranus twice that of\r\nSaturn), led both these astronomers to assume that the body sought was\r\nnearly double the distance of Uranus from the sun. With these few and\r\nimperfect data, as so many leading-strings proceeding from the planet\r\nUranus, they felt their way into the abysses of space by the aid of two\r\nsure guides--the law of gravitation and the higher geometry. Both\r\nastronomers arrived at nearly the same results, although they wrought\r\nindependently of each other, and each, indeed, without the knowledge of\r\nthe other. Le Verrier was the first to make public his conclusions,\r\nwhich he communicated to the French Academy at their sitting, August 31,\r\n1846. They saw that there existed, at nearly double the distance of\r\nUranus from the sun, a planet larger than that body; that it lay near a\r\ncertain star seen at that season in the southwest, in the evening sky;\r\nthat, on account of its immense distance, it was invisible to the naked\r\neye, and could be distinctly seen with a perceptible disk only by the\r\nmost powerful telescopes; being no brighter than a star of the ninth\r\nmagnitude, and subtending an angle of only three seconds. Le Verrier\r\ncommunicated these results to Dr. Galle, of Berlin, with the request\r\nthat he would search for the stranger with his powerful telescope,\r\npointing out the exact spot in the heavens where it would be found. On\r\nthe same evening, Dr. Galle directed his instrument to that part of the\r\nheavens, and immediately the planet presented itself to view, within one\r\ndegree of the very spot assigned to it by Le Verrier. Subsequent\r\ninvestigations have shown that its apparent size is within half a second\r\nof that which the same sagacious mind foresaw, and that its diameter is\r\nnearly equal to that of Uranus, being 31,000, while Uranus is 35,000\r\nmiles.[18] The distance from the sun is less than was predicted, being\r\nonly about 3000, instead of 3600 millions of miles; and its periodic\r\ntime is 164-1/2, instead of 217 years, as was supposed by Le Verrier.\r\nOne satellite only has yet been discovered, and this was first seen by\r\nProfessor Bond with the great telescope of Harvard University.\r\n\r\nRECENT TELESCOPIC DISCOVERIES.--The great reflecting telescope of Lord\r\nRosse, and the powerful refracting telescopes of Pulkova and Cambridge,\r\nhave opened new fields of discovery to the delighted astronomer. A new\r\nsatellite has been added to Saturn, first revealed to the Cambridge\r\ninstrument, making the entire number of moons that adorn the nocturnal\r\nsky of that remarkable planet no less than eight. Still more wonderful\r\nthings have been disclosed among the remotest _Nebulæ_. A number of\r\nthese objects before placed among the irresolvable nebulæ, and supposed\r\nto consist not of stars, but of mere nebulous matter, have been resolved\r\ninto stars; others, of which we before saw only a part, have revealed\r\nthemselves under new and strange forms, one resembling an animal with\r\nhuge branching arms, and hence called the _crab_ nebula; another\r\nimitating a scroll or vortex, and called the _whirlpool_ nebula; and\r\nother figures, which to ordinary telescopes appear only as dim specks on\r\nthe confines of creation, are presented to these wonderful instruments\r\nas glorious firmaments of stars.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1833, Sir John Herschel left England for the Cape of Good\r\nHope, furnished with powerful instruments for observing the stars and\r\nnebulæ of the southern hemisphere, which had never been examined in a\r\nmanner suited to disclose their full glories. This great astronomer and\r\nbenefactor to science devoted five years of the most assiduous toil in\r\nobserving and delineating the astronomical objects of that portion of\r\nthe heavens. He had before extended the catalogue of nebulæ begun by his\r\nillustrious father, Sir William Herschel, to the number of 2307; and\r\nbeginning at that point, he swelled the number, by his labors at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, to 4015. He extended also the list of double stars\r\nfrom 3346 to 5449, and showed that the luminous spots near the South\r\nPole, known to sailors by the name of the \"Magellan Clouds,\" consist of\r\nan assemblage of several hundred brilliant nebulæ.\r\n\r\nThe United States have contributed their full share to the recent\r\nprogress of astronomy. Powerful telescopes have been imported, made by\r\nthe first European artists, and numerous others, of scarcely inferior\r\nworkmanship and power, have been produced by artists of our own. The\r\nAmerican astronomers have also been the first to bring the electric\r\ntelegraph into use in astronomical observations; electric clocks have\r\nbeen so constructed as to beat simultaneously at places distant many\r\nhundred miles from each other, and thus to furnish means of determining\r\nthe difference of longitude between places with an astonishing degree of\r\naccuracy; and facilities for recording observations on the stars have\r\nbeen devised which render the work vastly more rapid as well as more\r\naccurate than before. Indeed, the inventive genius for which Americans\r\nhave been distinguished in all the useful arts seems now destined to be\r\nequally conspicuous in promoting the researches of science.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] The names of all the asteroids known at present are as follows:\r\n\r\n    1.
