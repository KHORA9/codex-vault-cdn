CAVE, at _St. John's Gate_. 1751.\r\n(_Price 2s. 6d._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_It may be necessary to acquaint the reader, that the following\r\nobservations and experiments were not drawn up with a view to their being\r\nmade publick, but were communicated at different times, and most of them in\r\nletters wrote on various topicks, as matters only of private amusement._\r\n\r\n_But some persons to whom they were read, and who had themselves been\r\nconversant in electrical disquisitions, were of opinion, they contain'd so\r\nmany curious and interesting particulars relative to this affair, that it\r\nwould be doing a kind of injustice to the publick, to confine them solely\r\nto the limits of a private acquaintance._\r\n\r\n_The Editor was therefore prevailed upon to commit such extracts of\r\nletters, and other detach'd pieces as were in his hands to the press,\r\nwithout waiting for the ingenious author's permission so to do; and this\r\nwas done with the less hesitation, as it was apprehended the author's\r\nengagements in other affairs, would scarce afford him leisure to give the\r\npublick his reflections and experiments on the subject, finish'd with that\r\ncare and precision, of which the treatise before us shews he is alike\r\nstudious and capable. He was only apprized of the step that had been thus\r\ntaken, while the first sheets were in the press, and time enough for him to\r\ntransmit some farther remarks, together with a few corrections and\r\nadditions, which are placed at the end, and may be consulted in the\r\nperusal._\r\n\r\n_The experiments which our author relates are most of them peculiar to\r\nhimself; they are conducted with judgment, and the inferences from them\r\nplain and conclusive; though sometimes proposed under the terms of\r\nsuppositions and conjectures._\r\n\r\n_And indeed the scene he opens, strikes us with a pleasing astonishment,\r\nwhilst he conducts us by a train of facts and judicious reflections, to a\r\nprobable cause of those phænomena, which are at once the most awful, and,\r\nhitherto, accounted for with the least verisimilitude._\r\n\r\n_He exhibits to our consideration, an invisible, subtile matter,\r\ndisseminated through all nature in various proportions, equally unobserved,\r\nand, whilst all those bodies to which it peculiarly adheres are alike\r\ncharged with it, inoffensive._\r\n\r\n_He shews, however, that if an unequal distribution is by any means brought\r\nabout; if there is a coacervation in one part of space, a less proportion,\r\nvacuity, or want, in another; by the near approach of a body capable of\r\nconducting the coacervated part to the emptier space, it becomes perhaps\r\nthe most formidable and irresistible agent in the universe. Animals are in\r\nan Instant struck breathless, bodies almost impervious by any force yet\r\nknown, are perforated, and metals fused by it, in a moment._\r\n\r\n_From the similar effects of lightening and electricity our author has been\r\nled to make some propable conjectures on the cause of the former; and at\r\nthe same time, to propose some rational experiments in order to secure\r\nourselves, and those things on which its force is often directed, from its\r\npernicious effects; a circumstance of no small importance to the publick,\r\nand therefore worthy of the utmost attention._\r\n\r\n_It has, indeed, been of late the fashion to ascribe every grand or unusual\r\noperation of nature, such as lightening and earthquakes, to electricity;\r\nnot, as one would imagine, from the manner of reasoning on these occasions,\r\nthat the authors of these schemes have, discovered any connection betwixt\r\nthe cause and effect, or saw in what manner they were related; but, as it\r\nwould seem, merely because they were unacquainted with any other agent, of\r\nwhich it could not positively be said the connection was impossible._\r\n\r\n_But of these, and many other interesting circumstances, the reader will be\r\nmore satisfactorily informed in the following letters, to which he is\r\ntherefore referred by_\r\n\r\n_The_ EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I.\r\n\r\nFROM\r\n\r\nMr BENJ. FRANKLIN, in _Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nMr PETER COLLINSON, F.R.S. _London_.\r\n\r\n_July 28, 1747_.\r\n\r\n  _SIR_,\r\n\r\nTHE necessary trouble of copying long letters, which perhaps when they come\r\nto your hands may contain nothing new, or worth your reading (so quick is\r\nthe progress made with you in Electricity) half discourages me from writing\r\nany more on that subject. Yet I cannot forbear adding a few observations on\r\nM. _Muschenbroek_'s wonderful bottle.\r\n\r\n1. The non-electric contain'd in the bottle differs when electrised from a\r\nnon-electric electrised out of the bottle, in this: that the electrical\r\nfire of the latter is accumulated _on its surface_, and forms an electrical\r\natmosphere round it of considerable extent: but the electrical fire is\r\ncrouded _into the substance_ of the former, the glass confining it.\r\n\r\n2. At the same time that the wire and top of the bottle, &c. is electrised\r\n_positively_ or _plus_, the bottom of the bottle is electrised _negatively_\r\nor _minus_, in exact proportion: _i. e._ whatever quantity of electrical\r\nfire is thrown in at top, an equal quantity goes out of the bottom. To\r\nunderstand this, suppose the common quantity of Electricity in each part of\r\nthe bottle, before the operation begins, is equal to 20; and at every\r\nstroke of the tube, suppose a quantity equal to 1 is thrown in; then, after\r\nthe first stroke, the quantity contain'd in the wire and upper part of the\r\nbottle will be 21, in the bottom 19. After the second, the upper part will\r\nhave 22, the lower 18, and so on 'till after 20 strokes, the upper part\r\nwill have a quantity of electrical fire equal to 40, the lower part none:\r\nand then the operation ends: for no more can be thrown into the upper part,\r\nwhen no more can be driven out of the lower part. If you attempt to throw\r\nmore in, it is spued back thro' the wire, or flies out in loud cracks thro'\r\nthe sides of the bottle.\r\n\r\n3. The equilibrium cannot be restored in the bottle by _inward_\r\ncommunication or contact of the parts; but it must be done by a\r\ncommunication formed _without_ the bottle, between the top and bottom, by\r\nsome non-electric, touching both at the same time; in which case it is\r\nrestored with a violence and quickness inexpressible: or, touching each\r\nalternately, in which case the equilibrium is restored by degrees.\r\n\r\n4. As no more electrical fire can be thrown into the top of the bottle,\r\nwhen all is driven out of the bottom, so in a bottle not yet electrised,\r\nnone can be thrown into the top, when none _can_ get out at the bottom;\r\nwhich happens either when the bottom is too thick, or when the bottle is\r\nplaced on an electric _per se_. Again, when the bottle is electrised, but\r\nlittle of the electrical fire can be _drawn out_ from the top, by touching\r\nthe wire, unless an equal quantity can at the same time _get in_ at the\r\nbottom. Thus, place an electrised bottle on clean glass or dry wax, and you\r\nwill not, by touching the wire, get out the fire from the top. Place it on\r\na non-electric, and touch the wire, you will get it out in a short time;\r\nbut soonest when you form a direct communication as above.\r\n\r\nSo wonderfully are these two states of Electricity, the _plus_ and _minus_,\r\ncombined and balanced in this miraculous bottle! situated and related to\r\neach other in a manner that I can by no means comprehend! If it were\r\npossible that a bottle should in one part contain a quantity of air\r\nstrongly comprest, and in another part a perfect vacuum, we know the\r\nequilibrium would be instantly restored _within_. But here we have a bottle\r\ncontaining at the same time a _plenum_ of electrical fire, and a _vacuum_\r\nof the same fire; and yet the equilibrium cannot be restored between them\r\nbut by a communication _without_! though the _plenum_ presses violently to\r\nexpand, and the hungry vacuum seems to attract as violently in order to be\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n5. The shock to the nerves (or convulsion rather) is occasion'd by the\r\nsudden passing of the fire through the body in its way from the top to the\r\nbottom of the bottle. The fire takes the shortest course, as Mr _Watson_\r\njustly observes: But it does not appear, from experiment, that, in order\r\nfor a person to be shocked, a communication with the floor is necessary;\r\nfor he that holds the bottle with one hand, and touches the wire with the\r\nother, will be shock'd as much, though his shoes be dry, or even standing\r\non wax, as otherwise. And on the touch of the wire (or of the gun-barrel,\r\nwhich is the same thing) the fire does not proceed from the touching finger\r\nto the wire, as is supposed, but from the wire to the finger, and passes\r\nthrough the body to the other hand, and so into the bottom of the bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS _confirming the above_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT I.\r\n\r\nPlace an electrised phial on wax; a small cork-ball suspended by a dry\r\nsilk-thread held in your hand, and brought near to the wire, will first be\r\nattracted, and then repelled: when in this state of repellency, sink your\r\nhand, that the ball may be brought towards the bottom of the bottle; it\r\nwill there be instantly and strongly attracted, 'till it has parted with\r\nits fire.\r\n\r\nIf the bottle had an electrical atmosphere, as well as the wire, an\r\nelectrified cork would be repelled from one as well as from the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT II.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. From a bent wire (_a_) sticking in the table, let a small linen\r\nthread (_b_) hang down within half an inch of the electrised phial (_c_).\r\nTouch the wire of the phial repeatedly with your finger, and at every touch\r\nyou will see the thread instantly attracted by the bottle. (This is best\r\ndone by a vinegar cruet, or some such belly'd bottle). As soon as you draw\r\nany fire out from the upper part by touching the wire, the lower part of\r\nthe bottle draws an equal quantity in by the thread.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT III.\r\n\r\nFIG. 2. Fix a wire in the lead, with which the bottom of the bottle is\r\narmed, (_d_) so as that bending upwards, its ring-end may be level with the\r\ntop or ring-end of the wire in the cork (_e_), and at three or four inches\r\ndistance. Then electricise the bottle, and place it on wax. If a cork\r\nsuspended by a silk thread (_f_) hang between these two wires, it will play\r\nincessantly from one to the other, 'till the bottle is no longer\r\nelectrised; that is, it fetches and carries fire from the top to the bottom\r\nof the bottle, 'till the equilibrium is restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT IV.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3. Place an electricised phial on wax; take a wire (_g_) in form of a\r\nC, the ends at such a distance when bent, as that the upper may touch the\r\nwire of the bottle, when the lower touches the bottom: stick the outer part\r\non a stick of sealing wax (_h_) which will serve as a handle. Then apply\r\nthe lower end to the bottom of the bottle, and gradually bring the\r\nupper-end near the wire in the cork. The consequence is, spark follows\r\nspark till the equilibrium is restored. Touch the top first, and on\r\napproaching the bottom with the other end, you have a constant stream of\r\nfire, from the wire entering the bottle. Touch the top and bottom together,\r\nand the equilibrium will soon be restored, but silently and imperceptibly;\r\nthe crooked wire forming the communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT V.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4. Let a ring of thin lead or paper surround a bottle (_i_), even at\r\nsome distance from or above the bottom. From that ring let a wire proceed\r\nup, 'till it touch the wire of the cork (_k_). A bottle so fixt cannot by\r\nany means be electrised: the equilibrium is never destroyed: for while the\r\ncommunication between the upper and lower parts of the bottle is continued\r\nby the outside wire, the fire only circulates: what is driven out at\r\nbottom, is constantly supply'd from the top. Hence a bottle cannot be\r\nelectrised that is foul or moist on the outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT VI.\r\n\r\nPlace a man on a cake of wax, and present him the wire of the electrified\r\nphial to touch, you standing on the floor, and holding it in your hand. As\r\noften as he touches it, he will be electrified _plus_; and any one standing\r\non the floor may draw a spark from him. The fire in this experiment passes\r\nout of the wire into him; and at the same time out of your hand into the\r\nbottom of the bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT VII.\r\n\r\nGive him the electrified phial to hold; and do you touch the wire; as often\r\nyou touch it he will be electrified _minus_, and may draw a spark from any\r\none standing on the floor. The fire now passes from the wire to you, and\r\nfrom him into the bottom of the bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT VIII.\r\n\r\nLay two books on two glasses, back towards back, two or three Inches\r\ndistant. Set the electrified phial on one, and then touch the wire; that\r\nbook will be electrified _minus_; the electrical fire being drawn out of it\r\nby the bottom of the bottle. Take off the bottle, and holding it in your\r\nhand, touch the other with the wire; that book will be electrised _plus_;\r\nthe fire passing into it from the wire, and the bottle at the same time\r\nsupply'd from your hand. A suspended small cork-ball will play between\r\nthese books 'till the equilibrium is restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT IX.\r\n\r\nWhen a body is electrised _plus_ it will repel an electrified feather or\r\nsmall cork-ball. When _minus_ (or when in the common state) it will attract\r\nthem, but stronger when _minus_ than when in the common state, the\r\ndifference being greater.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT X.\r\n\r\nTho', as in EXPER. VI. a man standing on wax may be electrised a number of\r\ntimes, by repeatedly touching the wire of an electrised bottle (held in the\r\nhand of one standing on the floor) he receiving the fire from the wire each\r\ntime: yet holding it in his own hand, and touching the wire, tho' he draws\r\na strong spark, and is violently shock'd, no Electricity remains in him;\r\nthe fire only passing thro' him from the upper to the lower part of the\r\nbottle. Observe, before the shock, to let some one on the floor touch him\r\nto restore the equilibrium in his body; for in taking hold of the bottom of\r\nthe bottle, he sometimes becomes a little electrised _minus_, which will\r\ncontinue after the shock; as would also any _plus_ Electricity, which he\r\nmight have given him before the shock. For, restoring the equilibrium in\r\nthe bottle does not at all affect the Electricity in the man thro' whom the\r\nfire passes; that Electricity is neither increased nor diminish'd.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT XI.\r\n\r\nThe passing of the electrical fire from the upper to the lower part of the\r\nbottle, to restore the equilibrium is render'd strongly visible by the\r\nfollowing pretty experiment. Take a book whose cover is filletted with\r\ngold; bend a wire of eight or ten inches long in the form of (_m_) FIG. 5,\r\nslip it on the end of the cover of the book over the gold line, so as that\r\nthe shoulder of it may press upon one end of the gold line, the ring up,\r\nbut leaning towards the other end of the book. Lay the book on a glass or\r\nwax; and on the other end of the gold lines, set the bottle electrised:\r\nthen bend the springing wire, by pressing it with a stick of wax till its\r\nring approaches the ring of the bottle wire; instantly there is a strong\r\nspark and stroke, and the whole line of gold, which completes the\r\ncommunication between the top and bottom of the bottle, will appear a vivid\r\nflame, like the sharpest lightning. The closer the contact between the\r\nshoulder of the wire, and the gold at one end of the line, and between the\r\nbottom of the bottle and the gold at the other end, the better the\r\nexperiment succeeds. The room should be darkened. If you would have the\r\nwhole filletting round the cover appear in fire at once, let the bottle and\r\nwire touch the gold in the diagonally opposite corners.\r\n\r\n_I am_, &c.\r\n\r\nB. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\nFROM\r\n\r\nMr BENJ. FRANKLIN, in _Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nMr PETER COLLINSON, F.R.S. _London_.\r\n\r\n_Sept. 1, 1747._\r\n\r\n  _SIR_,\r\n\r\nIn my last I informed you that, in pursuing our electrical enquiries, we\r\nhad observed some particular Phænomena, which we looked upon to be new, and\r\nof which I promised to give you some account, tho' I apprehended they might\r\npossibly not be new to you, as so many hands are daily employ'd in\r\nelectrical experiments on your side the water, some or other of which would\r\nprobably hit on the same observations.\r\n\r\nThe first is the wonderful effect of pointed bodies, both in _drawing off_\r\nand _throwing off_ the electrical fire. For example:\r\n\r\nPlace an iron shot of three or four inches diameter, on the mouth of a\r\nclean dry glass bottle. By a fine silken thread from the cieling, right\r\nover the mouth of the bottle, suspend a small cork-ball, about the bigness\r\nof a marble; the thread of such a length, as that the cork-ball may rest\r\nagainst the side of the shot. Electrify the shot, and the ball will be\r\nrepelled to the distance of four or five inches, more or less, according to\r\nthe quantity of Electricity.--When in this state, if you present to the\r\nshot the point of a long slender sharp bodkin, at six or eight inches\r\ndistance, the repellency is instantly destroy'd, and the cork flies to the\r\nshot. A blunt body must be brought within an inch, and draw a spark, to\r\nproduce the same effect. To prove that the electrical fire is _drawn off_\r\nby the point, if you take the blade of the bodkin out of the wooden handle,\r\nand fix it in a stick of sealing wax, and then present it at the distance\r\naforesaid, or if you bring it very near, no such effect follows; but\r\nsliding one finger along the wax till you touch the blade, and the ball\r\nflies to the shot immediately.--If you present the point in the dark, you\r\nwill see, sometimes at a foot distance, and more, a light gather upon it\r\nlike that of a fire-fly or glow-worm; the less sharp the point, the nearer\r\nyou must bring it to observe the light; and at whatever distance you see\r\nthe light, you may draw off the electrical fire, and destroy the\r\nrepellency.--If a cork-ball so suspended be repelled by the tube, and a\r\npoint be presented quick to it, tho' at a considerable distance, 'tis\r\nsurprizing to see how suddenly it flies back to the tube. Points of wood\r\nwill do as well as those of iron, provided the wood is not dry; for\r\nperfectly dry wood will no more conduct Electricity than sealing wax.\r\n\r\nTo shew that points will _throw off_ as well as _draw off_ the electrical\r\nfire; lay a long sharp needle upon the shot, and you cannot electrise the\r\nshot, so as to make it repel the cork-ball.--Or fix a needle to the end of\r\na suspended gun-barrel, or iron rod, so as to point beyond it like a little\r\nbayonet; and while it remains there, the gun-barrel, or rod, cannot by\r\napplying the tube to the other end be electrised so as to give a spark, the\r\nfire continually running out silently at the point. In the dark you may see\r\nit make the same appearance as it does in the case beforementioned.\r\n\r\nThe repellency between the cork-ball and the shot is likewise destroy'd; 1.\r\nBy sifting fine sand on it; this does it gradually. 2. By breathing on it.\r\n3. By making a smoke about it from burning wood.[1] 4. By candle light,\r\neven tho' the candle is at a foot distance: these do it suddenly.--The\r\nlight of a bright coal from a wood fire; and the light of red-hot iron do\r\nit likewise; but not at so great a distance. Smoke from dry rosin dropt on\r\nhot iron, does not destroy the repellency; but is attracted by both shot\r\nand cork-ball, forming proportionable atmospheres round them, making them\r\nlook beautifully, somewhat like some of the figures in _Burnet_'s or\r\n_Whiston_'s theory of the earth.\r\n\r\n_N. B._ This experiment should be made in a closet where the air is very\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nThe light of the sun thrown strongly on both cork and shot by a\r\nlooking-glass for a long time together, does not impair the repellency in\r\nthe least. This difference between fire-light and sun-light, is another\r\nthing that seems new and extraordinary to us.\r\n\r\nWe had for some time been of opinion, that the electrical fire was not\r\ncreated by friction, but collected, being really an element diffus'd among,\r\nand attracted by other matter, particularly by water and metals. We had\r\neven discovered and demonstrated its afflux to the electrical sphere, as\r\nwell as its efflux, by means of little light windmill wheels made of stiff\r\npaper vanes, fixed obliquely and turning freely on fine wire axes. Also by\r\nlittle wheels of the same matter, but formed like water wheels. Of the\r\ndisposition and application of which wheels, and the various phænomena\r\nresulting, I could, if I had time, fill you a sheet. The impossibility of\r\nelectrising one's self (tho' standing on wax) by rubbing the tube and\r\ndrawing the fire from it; and the manner of doing it by passing the tube\r\nnear a person or thing standing on the floor, &c. had also occurred to us\r\nsome months before Mr _Watson_'s ingenious _Sequel_ came to hand, and these\r\nwere some of the new things I intended to have communicated to you.--But\r\nnow I need only mention some particulars not hinted in that piece, with our\r\nreasonings thereupon; though perhaps the latter might well enough be\r\nspared.\r\n\r\n1. A person standing on wax, and rubbing the tube, and another person on\r\nwax drawing the fire; they will both of them, (provided they do not stand\r\nso as to touch one another) appear to be electrised, to a person standing\r\non the floor; that is, he will perceive a spark on approaching each of them\r\nwith his knuckle.\r\n\r\n2. But if the persons on wax touch one another during the exciting of the\r\ntube, neither of them will appear to be electrised.\r\n\r\n3. If they touch one another after exciting the tube, and drawing the fire\r\nas aforesaid, there will be a stronger spark between them, than was between\r\neither of them and the person on the floor.\r\n\r\n4. After such strong spark, neither of them discover any electricity.\r\n\r\nThese appearances we attempt to account for thus. We suppose as aforesaid,\r\nthat electrical fire is a common element, of which every one of the three\r\npersons abovementioned has his equal share, before any operation is begun\r\nwith the Tube. _A_, who stands on wax and rubs the tube collects the\r\nelectrical fire from himself into the glass; and his communication with the\r\ncommon stock being cut off by the wax, his body is not again immediately\r\nsupply'd. _B_, (who stands on wax likewise) passing his knuckle along near\r\nthe tube, receives the fire which was collected by the glass from _A_; and\r\nhis communication with the common stock being likewise cut off, he retains\r\nthe additional quantity received.--To _C_, standing on the floor, both\r\nappear to be electrised: for he having only the middle quantity of\r\nelectrical fire, receives a spark upon approaching _B_, who has an over\r\nquantity; but gives one to _A_, who has an under quantity. If _A_ and _B_\r\napproach to touch each other, the spark is stronger, because the difference\r\nbetween them is greater; after such touch there is no spark between either\r\nof them and _C_, because the electrical fire in all is reduced to the\r\noriginal equality. If they touch while electrising, the equality is never\r\ndestroy'd, the fire only circulating. Hence have arisen some new terms\r\namong us: we say, _B_, (and bodies like circumstanced) is electrised\r\n_positively_; _A_, _negatively_. Or rather, _B_ is electrised _plus_; _A_,\r\n_minus_. And we daily in our experiments electrise bodies _plus_ or _minus_\r\nas we think proper.--To electrise _plus_ or _minus_, no more needs to be\r\nknown than this, that the parts of the tube or sphere that are rubbed, do,\r\nin the instant of the friction attract the electrical fire, and therefore\r\ntake it from the thing rubbing: the same parts immediately, as the friction\r\nupon them ceases, are disposed to give the fire they have received, to any\r\nbody that has less. Thus you may circulate it, as Mr _Watson_ has shewn;\r\nyou may also accumulate or substract it upon or from any body, as you\r\nconnect that body with the rubber or with the receiver, the communication\r\nwith the common stock being cut off. We think that ingenious gentleman was\r\ndeceived, when he imagined (in his _Sequel_) that the electrical fire came\r\ndown the wire from the cieling to the gun-barrel, thence to the sphere, and\r\nso electrised the machine and the man turning the wheel, _&c._ We suppose\r\nit was _driven off_, and not brought on thro' that wire; and that the\r\nmachine and man, _&c._ were electrised _minus_; _i. e._ had less electrical\r\nfire in them than things in common.\r\n\r\nAs the vessel is just upon sailing, I cannot give you so large an account\r\nof American Electricity as I intended: I shall only mention a few\r\nparticulars more.--We find granulated lead better to fill the phial with,\r\nthan water, being easily warmed, and keeping warm and dry in damp air.--We\r\nfire spirits with the wire of the phial.--We light candles, just blown out,\r\nby drawing a spark among the smoke between the wire and snuffers.--We\r\nrepresent lightning, by passing the wire in the dark over a china plate\r\nthat has gilt flowers, or applying it to gilt frames of looking-glasses,\r\n_&c._--We electrise a person twenty or more times running, with a touch of\r\nthe finger on the wire, thus: He stands on wax. Give him the electrised\r\nbottle in his hand. Touch the wire with your finger, and then touch his\r\nhand or face; there are sparks every time.--We encrease the force of the\r\nelectrical kiss vastly, thus: Let _A_ and _B_ stand on wax; give one of\r\nthem the electrised phial in hand; let the other take hold of the wire;\r\nthere will be a small spark; but when their lips approach, they will be\r\nstruck and shock'd. The same if another gentleman and lady, _C_ and _D_,\r\nstanding also on wax, and joining hands with _A_ and _B_, salute, or shake\r\nhands.--We suspend by fine silk thread a counterfeit spider, made of a\r\nsmall piece of burnt cork, with legs of linnen thread, and a grain or two\r\nof lead stuck in him to give him more weight. Upon the table, over which he\r\nhangs, we stick a wire upright as high as the phial and wire, two or three\r\ninches from the spider; then we animate him by setting the electrified\r\nphial at the same distance on the other side of him; he will immediately\r\nfly to the wire of the phial, bend his legs in touching it, then spring\r\noff, and fly to the wire in the table; thence again to the wire of the\r\nphial, playing with his legs against both in a very entertaining manner,\r\nappearing perfectly alive to persons unacquainted. He will continue this\r\nmotion an hour or more in dry weather.--We electrify, upon wax in the dark,\r\na book that has a double line of gold round upon the covers, and then apply\r\na knuckle to the gilding; the fire appears every where upon the gold like a\r\nflash of lightning: not upon the leather, nor, if you touch the leather\r\ninstead of the gold. We rub our tubes with buckskin, and observe always to\r\nkeep the same side to the tube, and never to sully the tube by handling;\r\nthus they work readily and easily, without the least fatigue; especially if\r\nkept in tight pastboard cases, lined with flannel, and fitting closeto the\r\ntube.[2]--This I mention because the _European_ papers, on Electricity,\r\nfrequently speak of rubbing the tube, as a fatiguing exercise. Our spheres\r\nare fixed on iron axes, which pass through them. At one end of the axis\r\nthere is a small handle, with which we turn the sphere like a common\r\ngrindstone. This we find very commodious, as the machine takes up but\r\nlittle room, is portable, and may be enclosed in a tight box, when not in\r\nuse. 'Tis true, the sphere does not turn so swift, as when the great wheel\r\nis used: but swiftness we think of little importance, since a few turns\r\nwill charge the phial, _&c._ sufficiently.\r\n\r\n_I am_, &c.\r\n\r\nB. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\nFROM\r\n\r\nMr BENJ. FRANKLIN, in _Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nMr PETER COLLINSON, F.R.S. _London_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Farther_ EXPERIMENTS _and_ OBSERVATIONS _in_ ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1748._\r\n\r\n  _SIR_,\r\n\r\n§ 1. There will be the same explosion and shock, if the electrified phial\r\nis held in one hand by the hook, and the coating touch'd with the other, as\r\nwhen held by the coating, and touch'd at the hook.\r\n\r\n2. To take the charg'd phial safely by the hook, and not at the same time\r\ndiminish its force, it must first be set down on an electric _per se_.\r\n\r\n3. The phial will be electrified as strongly, if held by the hook, and the\r\ncoating apply'd to the globe or tube; as when held by the coating, and the\r\nhook apply'd.\r\n\r\n4. But the _direction_ of the electrical fire being different in the\r\ncharging, will also be different in the explosion. The bottle charged thro'\r\nthe hook, will be discharged thro' the hook; the bottle charged thro' the\r\ncoating, will be discharged thro' the coating, and not other ways: for the\r\nfire must come out the same way it went in.\r\n\r\n5. To prove this; take two bottles that were equally charged thro' the\r\nhooks, one in each hand; bring their hooks near each other, and no spark or\r\nshock will follow; because each hook is disposed to give fire, and neither\r\nto receive it. Set one of the bottles down on glass, take it up by the\r\nhook, and apply its coating to the hook of the other; then there will be an\r\nexplosion and shock, and both bottles will be discharged.\r\n\r\n6. Vary the experiment, by charging two phials equally, one thro' the hook,\r\nthe other thro' the coating: hold that by the coating which was charged\r\nthro' the hook; and that by the hook which was charg'd thro' the coating:\r\napply the hook of the first to the coating of the other, and there will be\r\nno shock or spark. Set that down on glass which you held by the hook, take\r\nit up by the coating, and bring the two hooks together: a spark and shock\r\nwill follow, and both phials be discharged.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment the bottles are totally discharged, or the equilibrium\r\nwithin them restored. The _abounding_ of fire in one of the hooks (or\r\nrather in the internal surface of one bottle) being exactly equal to the\r\n_wanting_ of the other: and therefore, as each bottle has in itself the\r\n_abounding_ as well as the _wanting_, the wanting and abounding must be\r\nequal in each bottle. See §. 8, 9, 10, 11. But if a man holds in his hands\r\ntwo bottles, one fully electrify'd, the other not at all, and brings their\r\nhooks together, he has but half a shock, and the bottles will both remain\r\nhalf electrified, the one being half discharged, and the other half\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\n7. Place two phials equally charged on a table at five or six inches\r\ndistance. Let a cork-ball, suspended by a silk thread, hang between them.\r\nIf the phials were both charged through their hooks, the cork, when it has\r\nbeen attracted and repell'd by the one, will not be attracted, but equally\r\nrepelled by the other. But if the phials were charged, the one through the\r\nhook, and the other[3] through the coating, the ball, when it is repelled\r\nfrom one hook, will be as strongly attracted by the other, and play\r\nvigorously between them, 'till both phials are nearly discharged.\r\n\r\n8. When we use the terms of _charging_ and _discharging_ the phial, 'tis in\r\ncompliance with custom, and for want of others more suitable. Since we are\r\nof opinion, that there is really no more electrical fire in the phial after\r\nwhat is called its _charging_, than before, nor less after its\r\n_discharging_; excepting only the small spark that might be given to, and\r\ntaken from, the non-electric matter, if separated from the bottle, which\r\nspark may not be equal to a five hundredth part of what is called the\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nFor if, on the explosion, the electrical fire came out of the bottle by one\r\npart, and did not enter in again by another; then, if a man standing on\r\nwax, and holding the bottle in one hand, takes the spark by touching the\r\nwire hook with the other, the bottle being thereby _discharged_, the man\r\nwould be _charged_; or whatever fire was lost by one, would be found in the\r\nother, since there is no way for its escape: But the contrary is true.\r\n\r\n9. Besides the phial will not suffer what is called a _charging_, unless as\r\nmuch fire can go out of it one way, as is thrown in by another. A phial\r\ncannot be charged standing on wax or glass, or hanging on the prime\r\nconductor, unless a communication be form'd between its coating and the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n10. But suspend two or more phials on the prime conductor, one hanging to\r\nthe tail of the other; and a wire from the last to the floor, an equal\r\nnumber of turns of the wheel shall charge them all equally, and every one\r\nas much as one alone would have been. What is driven out at the tail of the\r\nfirst, serving to charge the second; what is driven out of the second\r\ncharging the third; and so on. By this means a great number of bottles\r\nmight be charged with the same labour, and equally high, with one alone,\r\nwere it not that every bottle receives new fire, and loses its old with\r\nsome reluctance, or rather gives some small resistance to the charging,\r\nwhich in a number of bottles becomes more equal to the charging power, and\r\nso repels the fire back again on the globe, sooner than a single bottle\r\nwould do.\r\n\r\n11. When a bottle is charged in the common way, its _inside_ and _outside_\r\nsurfaces stand ready, the one to give fire by the hook, the other to\r\nreceive it by the coating; the one is full, and ready to throw out, the\r\nother empty and extremely hungry; yet as the first will not _give out_,\r\nunless the other can at the same instant _receive in_; so neither will the\r\nlatter receive in, unless the first can at the same instant give out. When\r\nboth can be done at once, 'tis done with inconceivable quickness and\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n12. So a strait spring (tho' the comparison does not agree in every\r\nparticular) when forcibly bent, must, to restore itself, contract that side\r\nwhich in the bending was extended, and extend that which was contracted; if\r\neither of these two operations be hindered, the other cannot be done. But\r\nthe spring is not said to be _charg'd_ with elasticity when bent, and\r\ndischarg'd when unbent; its quantity of elasticity is always the same.\r\n\r\n13. Glass, in like manner, has, within its substance, always the same\r\nquantity of electrical fire, and that a very great quantity in proportion\r\nto the mass of glass, as shall be shewn hereafter.\r\n\r\n14. This quantity, proportioned to the glass, it strongly and obstinately\r\nretains, and will have neither more nor less, though it will suffer a\r\nchange to be made in its parts and situation; _i. e._ we may take away part\r\nof it from one of the sides, provided we throw an equal quantity into the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n15. Yet when the situation of the electrical fire is thus altered in the\r\nglass; when some has been taken from one side, and some added to the other,\r\nit will not be at rest or in its natural state, till 'tis restored to its\r\noriginal equality.--And this restitution cannot be made through the\r\nsubstance of the glass, but must be done by a non-electric communication\r\nformed without, from surface to surface.\r\n\r\n16. Thus, the whole force of the bottle, and power of giving a shock, is in\r\nthe GLASS ITSELF; the non-electrics in contact with the two surfaces,\r\nserving only to _give_ and _receive_ to and from the several parts of the\r\nglass; that is, to give on one side, and take away from the other.\r\n\r\n17. This was discovered here in the following manner. Purposing to analyse\r\nthe electrified bottle, in order to find wherein its strength lay, we\r\nplaced it on glass, and drew out the cork and wire which for that purpose\r\nhad been loosely put in. Then taking the bottle in one hand, and bringing a\r\nfinger of the other near its mouth, a strong spark came from the water, and\r\nthe shock was as violent as if the wire had remained in it, which shewed\r\nthat the force did not lie in the wire. Then to find if it resided in the\r\nwater, being crouded into and condensed in it, as connfi'd by the glass,\r\nwhich had been our former opinion, we electrify'd the bottle again, and\r\nplacing it on glass, drew out the wire and cork as before; then taking up\r\nthe bottle we decanted all its water into an empty bottle, which likewise\r\nstood on glass; and taking up that other bottle, we expected if the force\r\nresided in the water, to find a shock from it; but there was none. We\r\njudged then, that it must either be lost in decanting, or remain in the\r\nfirst bottle. The latter we found to be true: for that bottle on trial gave\r\nthe shock, though filled up as it stood with fresh unelectrified water from\r\na tea-pot.--To find then, whether glass had this property merely as glass,\r\nor whether the form contributed any thing to it; we took a pane of\r\nsash-glass, and laying it on the stand, placed a plate of lead on its upper\r\nsurface; then electrify'd that plate, and bringing a finger to it, there\r\nwas a spark and shock. We then took two plates of lead of equal dimensions,\r\nbut less than the glass by two inches every way, and electrified the glass\r\nbetween them, by electrifying the uppermost lead; then separated the glass\r\nfrom the lead, in doing which, what little fire might be in the lead was\r\ntaken out and the glass being touched in the electrified parts with a\r\nfinger, afforded only very small pricking sparks, but a great number of\r\nthem might be taken from different places. Then dexterously placing it\r\nagain between the leaden plates, and compleating a circle between the two\r\nsurfaces, a violent shock ensued.--Which demonstrated the power to reside\r\nin glass as glass, and that the non-electrics in contact served only, like\r\nthe armature of a loadstone, to unite the force of the several parts, and\r\nbring them at once to any point desired: it being a property of a\r\nnon-electric, that the whole body instantly receives or gives what\r\nelectrical fire is given to or taken from any one of its parts.\r\n\r\n18. Upon this, we made what we call'd an _electrical-battery_, consisting\r\nof eleven panes of large sash-glass, arm'd with thin leaden plates pasted\r\non each side, placed vertically, and supported at two inches distance on\r\nsilk cords, with thick hooks of leaden wire, one from each side, standing\r\nupright, distant from each other, and convenient communications of wire and\r\nchain, from the giving side of one pane, to the receiving side of the\r\nother; that so the whole might be charged together, and with the same\r\nlabour as one single pane; and another contrivance to bring the giving\r\nsides, after charging, in contact with one long wire, and the receivers\r\nwith another, which two long wires would give the force of all the plates\r\nof glass at once through the body of any animal forming the circle with\r\nthem. The plates may also be discharged separately, or any number together\r\nthat is required. But this machine is not much used, as not perfectly\r\nanswering our intention with regard to the ease of charging, for the reason\r\ngiven § 10. We made also of large glass panes, magical pictures, and\r\nself-moving animated wheels, presently to be described.\r\n\r\n19. I perceive by the ingenious Mr _Watson_'s last book, lately received,\r\nthat Dr _Bevis_ had used, before we had, panes of glass to give a shock;\r\nthough, till that book came to hand, I thought to have communicated it to\r\nyou as a novelty. The excuse for mentioning it here, is, that we tried the\r\nexperiment differently, drew different consequences from it, (for Mr\r\n_Watson_ still seems to think the fire _accumulated on the non-electric_\r\nthat is in contact with the glass, page 72) and, as far as we hitherto\r\nknow, have carried it farther.\r\n\r\n20. The magical picture is made thus. Having a large metzotinto with a\r\nframe and glass, suppose of the KING, (God preserve him) take out the\r\nprint, and cut a pannel out of it, near two inches distant from the frame\r\nall round. If the cut is through the picture 'tis not the worse. With thin\r\npaste or gum-water, fix the border that is cut off on the inside of the\r\nglass, pressing it smooth and close; then fill up the vacancy by gilding\r\nthe glass well with leaf gold or brass. Gild likewise the inner edge of the\r\nback of the frame all round except the top part, and form a communication\r\nbetween that gilding and the gilding behind the glass: then put in the\r\nboard, and that side is finished. Turn up the glass, and gild the fore side\r\nexactly over the back gilding, and when it is dry, cover it by pasting on\r\nthe pannel of the picture that had been cut out, observing to bring the\r\ncorresponding parts of the border and picture together, by which the\r\npicture will appear of a piece as at first, only part is behind the glass,\r\nand part before.--Hold the picture horizontally by the top, and place a\r\nlittle moveable gilt crown on the king's-head. If now the picture be\r\nmoderately electrified, and another person take hold of the frame with one\r\nhand, so that his fingers touch its inside gilding, and with the other hand\r\nendeavour to take off the crown, he will receive a terrible blow, and fail\r\nin the attempt. If the picture were highly charged, the consequence might\r\nperhaps be as fatal as that of high-treason; for when the spark is taken\r\nthrough a quire of paper laid on the picture, by means of a wire\r\ncommunication, it makes a fair hole through every sheet, that is, through\r\n48 leaves, (though a quire of paper is thought good armour against the push\r\nof a sword or even against a pistol bullet) and the crack is exceeding\r\nloud. The operator, who holds the picture by the upper-end, where the\r\ninside of the frame is not gilt, to prevent its falling, feels nothing of\r\nthe shock, and may touch the face of the picture without danger, which he\r\npretends is a test of his loyalty.--If a ring of persons take the shock\r\namong them, the experiment is called, _The Conspirators_.\r\n\r\n21. On the principle, in § 7, that hooks of bottles, differently charged,\r\nwill attract and repel differently, is made, an electrical wheel, that\r\nturns with considerable strength. A small upright shaft of wood passes at\r\nright angles through a thin round board, of about twelve inches diameter,\r\nand turns on a sharp point of iron fixed in the lower end, while a strong\r\nwire in the upper-end passing thro' a small hole in a thin brass plate,\r\nkeeps the shaft truly vertical. About thirty _radii_ of equal length, made\r\nof sash glass cut in narrow strips, issue horizontally from the\r\ncircumference of the board, the ends most distant from the center being\r\nabout four inches apart. On the end of every one, a brass thimble is fixed.\r\nIf now the wire of a bottle electrified in the common way, be brought near\r\nthe circumference of this wheel, it will attract the nearest thimble, and\r\nso put the wheel in motion; that thimble, in passing by, receives a spark,\r\nand thereby being electrified is repelled and so driven forwards; while a\r\nsecond being attracted, approaches the wire, receives a spark, and is\r\ndriven after the first, and so on till the wheel has gone once round, when\r\nthe thimbles before electrified approaching the wire, instead of being\r\nattracted as they were at first, are repelled, and the motion presently\r\nceases.--But if another bottle which had been charged through the coating\r\nbe placed near the same wheel, its wire will attract the thimble repelled\r\nby the first, and thereby double the force that carries the wheel round;\r\nand not only taking out the fire that had been communicated to the thimbles\r\nby the first bottle, but even robbing them of their natural quantity,\r\ninstead of being repelled when they come again towards the first bottle,\r\nthey are more strongly attracted, so that the wheel mends its pace, till it\r\ngoes with great rapidity twelve or fifteen rounds in a minute, and with\r\nsuch strength, as that the weight of one hundred _Spanish_ dollars with\r\nwhich we once loaded it, did not seem in the least to retard its\r\nmotion.--This is called an electrical jack; and if a large fowl were\r\nspitted on the upright shaft, it would be carried round before a fire with\r\na motion fit for roasting.\r\n\r\n22. But this wheel, like those driven by wind, water, or weights, moves by\r\na foreign force, to wit, that of the bottles. The self-moving wheel, though\r\nconstructed on the same principles, appears more surprising. 'Tis made of a\r\nthin round plate of window-glass, seventeen inches diameter, well gilt on\r\nboth sides, all but two inches next the edge. Two small hemispheres of wood\r\nare then fixed with cement to the middle of the upper and under sides,\r\ncentrally opposite, and in each of them a thick strong wire eight or ten\r\ninches long, which together make the axis of the wheel. It turns\r\nhorizontally on a point at the lower end of its Axis, which rests on a bit\r\nof brass cemented within a glass salt-celler. The upper end of its axis\r\npasses thro' a hole in a thin brass plate cemented to a long strong piece\r\nof glass, which keeps it six or eight inches distant from any non-electric,\r\nand has a small ball of wax or metal on its top to keep in the fire. In a\r\ncircle on the table which supports the wheel, are fixed twelve small\r\npillars of glass, at about four inches distance, with a thimble on the top\r\nof each. On the edge of the wheel is a small leaden bullet communicating by\r\na wire with the gilding of the _upper_ surface of the wheel; and about six\r\ninches from it is another bullet communicating in like manner with the\r\n_under_ surface. When the wheel is to be charged by the upper surface, a\r\ncommunication must be made from the under surface to the table. When it is\r\nwell charg'd it begins to move; the bullet nearest to a pillar moves\r\ntowards the thimble on that pillar, and passing by electrifies it and then\r\npushes itself from it; the succeeding bullet, which communicates with the\r\nother surface of the glass, more strongly attracts that thimble on account\r\nof its being before electrified by the other bullet; and thus the wheel\r\nencreases its motion till it comes to such a height as that the resistance\r\nof the air regulates it. It will go half an hour, and make one minute with\r\nanother twenty turns in a minute, which is six hundred turns in the whole;\r\nthe bullet of the upper surface giving in each turn twelve sparks, to the\r\nthimbles, which make seven thousand two hundred sparks; and the bullet of\r\nthe under surface receiving as many from the thimbles; those bullets moving\r\nin the time near two thousand five hundred feet.--The thimbles are well\r\nfixed, and in so exact a circle, that the bullets may pass within a very\r\nsmall distance of each of them.--If instead of two bullets you put eight,\r\nfour communicating with the upper surface, and four with the under surface,\r\nplaced alternately; which eight, at about six inches distance, compleats\r\nthe circumference, the force and swiftness will be greatly increased, the\r\nwheel making fifty turns in a minute; but then it will not continue moving\r\nso long.--These wheels may be applied, perhaps, to the ringing of chimes,\r\nand moving of light-made Orreries.\r\n\r\n23. A small wire bent circularly with a loop at each end; let one end rest\r\nagainst the under surface of the wheel, and bring the other end near the\r\nupper surface, it will give a terrible crack, and the force will be\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\n24. Every spark in that manner drawn from the surface of the wheel, makes a\r\nround hole in the gilding, tearing off a part of it in coming out; which\r\nshews that the fire is not accumulated on the gilding, but is in the glass\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n25. The gilding being varnish'd over with turpentine varnish, the varnish\r\ntho' dry and hard, is burnt by the spark drawn thro' it, and gives a strong\r\nsmell and visible smoke. And when the spark is drawn through paper, all\r\nround the hole made by it, the paper will be blacked by the smoke, which\r\nsometimes penetrates several of the leaves. Part of the gilding torn off,\r\nis also found forcibly driven into the hole made in the paper by the\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\n26. 'Tis amazing to observe in how small a portion of glass a great\r\nelectrical force may lie. A thin glass bubble, about an inch diameter,\r\nweighing only six grains, being half-filled with water, partly gilt on the\r\noutside, and furnish'd with a wire hook, gives, when electrified, as great\r\na shock as a man can well bear. As the glass is thickest near the orifice,\r\nI suppose the lower half, which being gilt was electrified, and gave the\r\nshock, did not exceed two grains; for it appeared, when broke, much thinner\r\nthan the upper half.--If one of these thin bottles be electrified by the\r\ncoating, and the spark taken out thro' the gilding, it will break the glass\r\ninwards at the same time that it breaks the gilding outwards.\r\n\r\n27. And allowing (for the reasons before given, § 8, 9, 10,) that there is\r\nno more electrical fire in a bottle after charging, than before, how great\r\nmust be the quantity in this small portion of glass! It seems as if it were\r\nof its very substance and essence. Perhaps if that due quantity of\r\nelectrical fire so obstinately retained by glass, could be separated from\r\nit, it would no longer be glass; it might lose its transparency, or its\r\nbrittleness, or its elasticity.--Experiments may possibly be invented\r\nhereafter, to discover this.\r\n\r\n27. We are surprized at the account given in Mr _Watson_'s book, of a shock\r\ncommunicated through a great space of dry ground, and suspect there must be\r\nsome metaline quality in the gravel of that ground; having found that\r\nsimple dry earth, rammed in a glass tube, open at both ends, and a wire\r\nhook inserted in the earth at each end, the earth and wires making part of\r\na circle, would not conduct the least perceptible shock, and indeed when\r\none wire was electrify'd, the other hardly showed any signs of its being in\r\nconnection with it.--Even a thoroughly wet pack-thread sometimes fails of\r\nconducting a shock, tho' it otherwise conducts electricity very well. A dry\r\ncake of ice, or an icicle held between two in a circle, likewise prevents\r\nthe shock; which one would not expect, as water conducts it so perfectly\r\nwell.--Gilding on a new book, though at first it conducts the shock\r\nextremely well, yet fails after ten or a dozen experiments, though it\r\nappears otherwise in all respects the same, which we cannot account for.\r\n\r\n28. There is one experiment more which surprizes us, and is not hitherto\r\nsatisfactorily accounted for; it is this. Place an iron shot on a glass\r\nstand, and let a ball of damp cork, suspended by a silk thread, hang in\r\ncontact with the shot. Take a bottle in each hand, one that is electrify'd\r\nthrough the hook, the other through the coating: Apply the giving wire to\r\nthe shot, which will electrify it _positively_, and the cork shall be\r\nrepelled: Then apply the requiring wire, which will take out the spark\r\ngiven by the other; when the cork will return to the shot: Apply the same\r\nagain, and take out another spark, so will the shot be electrify'd\r\n_negatively_; and the cork in that case shall be repelled equally as\r\nbefore. Then apply the giving wire to the shot, and give the spark it\r\nwanted, so will the cork return: Give it another, which will be an addition\r\nto its natural quantity, so will the cork be repelled again: And so may the\r\nexperiment be repeated as long as there is any charge in the bottles. Which\r\nshews that bodies having less than the common quantity of Electricity,\r\nrepel each other, as well as those that have more.\r\n\r\nChagrined a little that we have hitherto been able to produce nothing in\r\nthis way of use to mankind; and the hot weather coming on, when electrical\r\nexperiments are not so agreeable, 'tis proposed to put an end to them for\r\nthis season, somewhat humorously, in a party of pleasure, on the banks of\r\n_Skuylkill_.[4] Spirits, at the same time, are to be fired by a spark sent\r\nfrom side to side through the river, without any other conductor than the\r\nwater; an experiment which we some time since performed, to the amazement\r\nof many. A turkey is to be killed for our dinner by the _electrical shock_,\r\nand roasted by the _electrical jack_, before a fire kindled by the\r\n_electrified bottle_; when the healths of all the famous electricians in\r\n_England_, _Holland_, _France_, and _Germany_, are to be drank in\r\n[5]_electrified bumpers_, under the discharge of guns from the _electrical\r\nbattery_.\r\n\r\n  _April 29,\r\n    1749._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS _and_ SUPPOSITIONS, _towards forming a new_ HYPOTHESIS, _for\r\nexplaining the several_ Phænomena _of_ THUNDER-GUSTS.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _SIR_,\r\n\r\n§. 1. Non-electric bodies, that have electric fire thrown into them, will\r\nretain it 'till other non-electrics, that have less, approach; and then\r\n'tis communicated by a snap, and becomes equally divided.\r\n\r\n2. Electrical fire loves water, is strongly attracted by it, and they can\r\nsubsist together.\r\n\r\n3. Air is an electric _per se_, and when dry will not conduct the\r\nelectrical fire; it will neither receive it, nor give it to other bodies;\r\notherwise no body surrounded by air could be electrified positively and\r\nnegatively: for should it be attempted positively, the air would\r\nimmediately take away the overplus; or negatively, the air would supply\r\nwhat was wanting.\r\n\r\n4. Water being electrified, the vapours arising from it will be equally\r\nelectrified; and floating in the air, in the form of clouds, or otherwise,\r\nwill retain that quantity of electrical fire, till they meet with other\r\nclouds or bodies not so much electrified, and then will communicate as\r\nbeforementioned.\r\n\r\n5. Every particle of matter electrified is repelled by every other particle\r\nequally electrified. Thus the stream of a fountain, naturally dense and\r\ncontinual, when electrified, will separate and spread in the form of a\r\nbrush, every drop endeavouring to recede from every other drop. But on\r\ntaking out the electrical fire, they close again.\r\n\r\n6. Water being strongly electrified (as well as when heated by common fire)\r\nrises in vapours more copiously; the attraction of cohesion among its\r\nparticles being greatly weakened, by the opposite power of repulsion\r\nintroduced with the electrical fire; and when any particle is by any means\r\ndisengaged, 'tis immediately repelled, and so flies into the air.\r\n\r\n7. Particles happening to be situated as _A_ and _B_, are more easily\r\ndisengaged than _C_ and _D_, as each is held by contact with three only,\r\nwhereas _C_ and _D_ are each in contact with nine. When the surface of\r\nwater has the least motion, particles are continually pushed into the\r\nsituation represented by FIG. 6.\r\n\r\n8. Friction between a non-electric and an electric _per se_, will produce\r\nelectrical fire; not by _creating_, but _collecting_ it: for it is equally\r\ndiffused in our walls, floors, earth, and the whole mass of common matter.\r\nThus the whirling glass globe, during its friction against the cushion,\r\ndraws fire from the cushion, the cushion is supplied from the frame of the\r\nmachine, that from the floor on which it stands. Cut off the communication\r\nby thick glass or wax placed under the cushion, and no fire can be\r\n_produced_, because it cannot be _collected_.\r\n\r\n9. The Ocean is a compound of water, a non-electric, and salt an electric\r\n_per se_.\r\n\r\n10. When there is a friction among the parts near its surface, the\r\nelectrical fire is collected from the parts below. It is then plainly\r\nvisible in the night; it appears at the stern and in the wake of every\r\nsailing vessel; every dash of an oar shows it, and every surff and spray:\r\nin storms the whole sea seems on fire.--The detach'd particles of water\r\nthen repelled from the electrified surface, continually carry off the fire\r\nas it is collected; they rise, and form clouds, and those clouds are highly\r\nelectrified, and retain the fire 'till they have an opportunity of\r\ncommunicating it.\r\n\r\n11. The particles of water rising in vapours, attach themselves to\r\nparticles of air.\r\n\r\n12. The particles of air are said to be hard, round, separate and distant\r\nfrom each other; every particle strongly repelling every other particle,\r\nwhereby they recede from each other, as far as common gravity will permit.\r\n\r\n13. The space between any three particles equally repelling each other,\r\nwill be an equilateral triangle.\r\n\r\n14. In air compressed, these triangles are smaller; in rarified Air they\r\nare larger.\r\n\r\n15. Common fire joined with air, increases the repulsion, enlarges the\r\ntriangles, and thereby makes the air specifically lighter. Such Air among\r\ndenser air, will rise.\r\n\r\n16. Common fire, as well as electrical fire gives repulsion to the\r\nparticles of water, and destroys their attraction of cohesion; hence common\r\nfire, as well as electrical fire, assists in raising vapours.\r\n\r\n17. Particles of water, having no fire in them, mutually attract each\r\nother. Three particles of water then being attached to the three particles\r\nof a triangle of air, would by their mutual attraction operating against\r\nthe air's repulsion, shorten the sides and lessen the triangle, whereby\r\nthat portion of air being made denser, would sink to the earth with its\r\nwater, and not rise to contribute to the formation of a cloud.\r\n\r\n18. But if every particle of water attaching itself to air, brings with it\r\na particle of common fire, the repulsion of the air being assisted and\r\nstrengthened by the fire, more than obstructed by the mutual attraction of\r\nthe particles of water, the triangle dilates, and that portion of air\r\nbecoming rarer and specifically lighter rises.\r\n\r\n19. If the particles of water bring electrical fire when they attach\r\nthemselves to air, the repulsion between the particles of water\r\nelectrified, joins with the natural repulsion of the air, to force its\r\nparticles to a greater distance, whereby the triangles are dilated, and the\r\nair rises, carrying up with it the water.\r\n\r\n20. If the particles of water bring with them portions of _both sorts_ of\r\nfire, the repulsions of the particles of air is still more strengthened and\r\nincreased, and the triangles farther enlarged.\r\n\r\n21. One particle of air may be surrounded by twelve particles of water of\r\nequal size with itself, all in contact with it; and by more added to those.\r\n\r\n22. Particles of air thus loaded would be drawn nearer together by the\r\nmutual attraction of the particles of water, did not the fire, common or\r\nelectrical, assist their repulsion.\r\n\r\n23. If air thus loaded be compressed by adverse winds, or by being driven\r\nagainst mountains, &c. or condensed by taking away the fire that assisted\r\nit in expanding; the triangles contract, the air with its water will\r\ndescend as a dew; or, if the water surrounding one particle of air comes in\r\ncontact with the water surrounding another, they coalesce and form a drop,\r\nand we have rain.\r\n\r\n24. The sun supplies (or seems to supply) common fire to all vapours,\r\nwhether raised from earth or sea.\r\n\r\n25. Those vapours which have both common and electrical fire in them, are\r\nbetter supported, than those which have only common fire in them. For when\r\nvapours rise into the coldest region above the earth, the cold will not\r\ndiminish the electrical fire, if it doth the common.\r\n\r\n26. Hence clouds formed by vapours raised from fresh waters within land,\r\nfrom growing vegetables, moist earth, &c. more speedily and easily deposite\r\ntheir water, having but little electrical fire to repel and keep the\r\nparticles separate. So that the greatest part of the water raised from the\r\nland is let fall on the land again; and winds blowing from the land to the\r\nsea are dry; there being little use for rain on the sea, and to rob the\r\nland of its moisture, in order to rain on the sea, would not appear\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n27. But clouds formed by vapours raised from the sea, having both fires,\r\nand particularly a great quantity of the electrical, support their water\r\nstrongly, raise it high, and being moved by winds may bring it over the\r\nmiddle of the broadest continent from the middle of the widest ocean.\r\n\r\n28. How these ocean clouds, so strongly supporting their water, are made to\r\ndeposite it on the land where 'tis wanted, is next to be considered.\r\n\r\n29. If they are driven by winds against mountains, those mountains being\r\nless electrified attract them, and on contact take away their electrical\r\nfire (and being cold, the common fire also;) hence the particles close\r\ntowards the mountains and towards each other. If the air was not much\r\nloaded, it only falls in dews on the mountain tops and sides, forms\r\nsprings, and descends to the vales in rivulets, which united make larger\r\nstreams and rivers. If much loaded, the electrical fire is at once taken\r\nfrom the whole cloud; and, in leaving it, flashes brightly and cracks\r\nloudly; the particles instantly coalescing for want of that fire, and\r\nfalling in a heavy shower.\r\n\r\n30. When a ridge of mountains thus dams the clouds, and draws the\r\nelectrical fire from the cloud first approaching it; that which next\r\nfollows, when it comes near the first cloud, now deprived of its fire,\r\nflashes into it, and begins to deposite its own water; the first cloud\r\nagain flashing into the mountains; the third approaching cloud, and all the\r\nsucceeding ones, acting in the same manner as far back as they extend,\r\nwhich may be over many hundred miles of country.\r\n\r\n31. Hence the continual storms of rain, thunder, and lightning on the\r\neast-side of the _Andes_, which running north and south, and being vastly\r\nhigh, intercept all the clouds brought against them from the _Atlantic_\r\nocean by the trade winds, and oblige them to deposite their waters, by\r\nwhich the vast rivers _Amazons_, _La Plata_, and _Oroonoko_ are formed,\r\nwhich return the water into the same sea, after having fertilized a country\r\nof very great extent.\r\n\r\n32. If a country be plain, having no mountains to intercept the electrified\r\nclouds, yet is it not without means to make them deposite their water. For\r\nif an electrified cloud coming from the sea, meets in the air a cloud\r\nraised from the land, and therefore not electrified; the first will flash\r\nits fire into the latter, and thereby both clouds shall be made suddenly to\r\ndeposite water.\r\n\r\n33. The electrified particles of the first cloud close when they lose their\r\nfire; the particles of the other cloud close in receiving it: in both, they\r\nhave thereby an opportunity of coalescing into drops.--The concussion or\r\njerk given to the air, contributes also to shake down the water, not only\r\nfrom those two clouds but from others near them. Hence the sudden fall of\r\nrain immediately after flashes of lightning.\r\n\r\n34. To shew this by an easy experiment. Take two round pieces of pasteboard\r\ntwo inches diameter; from the center and circumference of each of them\r\nsuspend by fine silk threads eighteen inches long, seven small balls of\r\nwood, or seven peas equal in bigness; so will the balls appending to each\r\npasteboard, form equal equilateral triangles, one ball being in the center,\r\nand six at equal distances from that, and from each other; and thus they\r\nrepresent particles of air. Dip both sets in water, and some cohering to\r\neach ball they will represent air loaded. Dexterously electrify one set,\r\nand its balls will repel each other to a greater distance, enlarging the\r\ntriangles. Could the water supported by the seven balls come into contact,\r\nit would form a drop or drops so heavy as to break the cohesion it had with\r\nthe balls, and so fall.--Let the two sets then represent two clouds, the\r\none a sea cloud electrified, the other a land cloud. Bring them within the\r\nsphere of attraction, and they will draw towards each other, and you will\r\nsee the separated balls close thus; the first electrified ball that comes\r\nnear an unelectrified ball by attraction joins it, and gives it fire;\r\ninstantly they separate, and each flies to another ball of its own party,\r\none to give, the other to receive fire; and so it proceeds through both\r\nsets, but so quick as to be in a manner instantaneous. In the collision\r\nthey shake off and drop their water, which represents rain.\r\n\r\n35. Thus when sea and land clouds would pass at too great a distance for\r\nthe flash, they are attracted towards each other till within that distance;\r\nfor the sphere of electrical attraction is far beyond the distance of\r\nflashing.\r\n\r\n36. When a great number of clouds from the sea meet a number of clouds\r\nraised from the land, the electrical flashes appear to strike in different\r\nparts; and as the clouds are jostled and mixed by the winds, or brought\r\nnear by the electrical attraction, they continue to give and receive flash\r\nafter flash, till the electrical fire is equally diffused.\r\n\r\n37. When the gun-barrel (in electrical experiments) has but little\r\nelectrical fire in it, you must approach it very near with your knuckle,\r\nbefore you can draw a spark. Give it more fire, and it will give a spark at\r\na greater distance. Two gun-barrels united, and as highly electrified, will\r\ngive a spark at a still greater distance. But if two gun-barrels\r\nelectrified will strike at two inches distance, and make a loud snap, to\r\nwhat a great distance may 10,000 acres of electrified cloud strike and give\r\nits fire, and how loud must be that crack!\r\n\r\n38. It is a common thing to see clouds at different heights passing\r\ndifferent ways, which shews different currents of air, one under the other.\r\nAs the air between the tropics is rarified by the sun, it rises, the denser\r\nnorthern and southern air pressing into its place. The air so rarified and\r\nforced up, passes northward and southward, and must descend in the polar\r\nregions, if it has no opportunity before, that the circulation may be\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\n39. As currents of air, with the clouds therein, pass different ways, 'tis\r\neasy to conceive how the clouds, passing over each other, may attract each\r\nother, and so come near enough for the electrical stroke. And also how\r\nelectrical clouds may be carried within land very far from the sea, before\r\nthey have an opportunity to strike.\r\n\r\n40. When the air, with its vapours raised from the ocean between the\r\ntropics, comes to descend in the polar regions, and to be in contact with\r\nthe vapours arising there, the electrical fire they brought begins to be\r\ncommunicated, and is seen in clear nights, being first visible where 'tis\r\nfirst in motion, that is, where the contact begins, or in the most northern\r\npart; from thence the streams of light seem to shoot southerly, even up to\r\nthe zenith of northern countries. But tho' the light seems to shoot from\r\nthe north southerly, the progress of the fire is really from the south\r\nnortherly, its motion beginning in the north being the reason that 'tis\r\nthere first seen.\r\n\r\nFor the electrical fire is never visible but when in motion, and leaping\r\nfrom body to body, or from particle to particle thro' the air. When it\r\npasses thro' dense bodies 'tis unseen. When a wire makes part of the\r\ncircle, in the explosion of the electrical phial, the fire, though in great\r\nquantity, passes in the wire invisibly: but in passing along a chain, it\r\nbecomes visible as it leaps from link to link. In passing along\r\nleaf-gilding 'tis visible: for the leaf-gold is full of pores; hold a leaf\r\nto the light and it appears like a net; and the fire is seen in its leaping\r\nover the vacancies.--And as when a long canal filled with still water is\r\nopened at one end, in order to be discharged, the motion of the water\r\nbegins first near the opened end, and proceeds towards the close end, tho'\r\nthe water itself moves from the close towards the opened end: so the\r\nelectrical fire discharged into the polar regions, perhaps from a thousand\r\nleagues length of vaporiz'd air, appears first where 'tis first in motion,\r\n_i. e._ in the most northern part, and the appearance proceeds southward,\r\ntho' the fire really moves northward. This is supposed to account for the\r\n_Aurora Borealis_.\r\n\r\n41. When there is great heat on the land, in a particular region (the sun\r\nhaving shone on it perhaps several days, while the surrounding countries\r\nhave been screen'd by clouds) the lower air is rarified and rises, the\r\ncooler denser air above descends; the clouds in that air meet from all\r\nsides, and join over the heated place; and if some are electrified, others\r\nnot, lightning and thunder succeed, and showers fall. Hence thunder-gusts\r\nafter heats, and cool air after gusts; the water and the clouds that bring\r\nit, coming from a higher and therefore a cooler region.\r\n\r\n42. An electrical spark, drawn from an irregular body at some distance is\r\nscarce ever strait, but shows crooked and waving in the air. So do the\r\nflashes of lightning; the clouds being very irregular bodies.\r\n\r\n43. As electrified clouds pass over a country, high hills and high trees,\r\nlofty towers, spires, masts of ships, chimneys, _&c._ as so many\r\nprominencies and points, draw the electrical fire, and the whole cloud\r\ndischarges there.\r\n\r\n44. Dangerous, therefore, is it to take shelter under a tree during a\r\nthunder-gust. It has been fatal to many, both men and beasts.\r\n\r\n45. It is safer to be in the open field for another reason. When the\r\nclothes are wet, if a flash in its way to the ground should strike your\r\nhead, it will run in the water over the surface of your body; whereas, if\r\nyour clothes were dry, it would go thro' the body.\r\n\r\nHence a wet rat cannot be killed by the exploding electrical bottle, when a\r\ndry rat may.\r\n\r\n46. Common fire is in all bodies, more or less, as well as electrical fire.\r\nPerhaps they may be different modifications of the same element; or they\r\nmay be different elements. The latter is by some suspected.\r\n\r\n47. If they are different things, yet they may and do subsist together in\r\nthe same body.\r\n\r\n48. When electrical fire strikes thro' a body, it acts upon the common fire\r\ncontained in it, and puts that fire in motion; and if there be a sufficient\r\nquantity of each kind of fire, the body will be inflamed.\r\n\r\n49. When the quantity of common fire in the body is small, the quantity of\r\nthe electrical fire (or the electrical stroke) should be greater: if the\r\nquantity of common fire be great, less electrical fire suffices to produce\r\nthe effect.\r\n\r\n50. Thus spirits must be heated before we can fire them by the electrical\r\nspark. If they are much heated a small spark will do; if not, the spark\r\nmust be greater.\r\n\r\n51. Till lately we could only fire warm vapours; but now we can burn hard\r\ndry rosin. And when we can procure greater electrical sparks, we may be\r\nable to fire not only unwarm'd spirits, as lightning does, but even wood,\r\nby giving sufficient agitation to the common fire contained in it, as\r\nfriction we know will do.\r\n\r\n52. Sulphureous and inflammable vapours arising from the earth, are easily\r\nkindled by lightning. Besides what arise from the earth, such vapours are\r\nsent out by stacks of moist hay, corn, or other vegetables, which heat and\r\nreek. Wood rotting in old trees or buildings does the same. Such are\r\ntherefore easily and often fired.\r\n\r\n53. Metals are often melted by lightning, tho' perhaps not from heat in the\r\nlightning, nor altogether from agitated fire in the metals.--For as\r\nwhatever body can insinuate itself between the particles of metal, and\r\novercome the attraction by which they cohere (as sundry menstrua can) will\r\nmake the solid become a fluid, as well as fire, yet without heating it: so\r\nthe electrical fire, or lightning, creating a violent repulsion between the\r\nparticles of the metal it passes thro', the metal is fused.\r\n\r\n54. If you would, by a violent fire, melt off the end of a nail, which is\r\nhalf driven into a door, the heat given the whole nail before a part would\r\nmelt, must burn the board it sticks in. And the melted part would burn the\r\nfloor it dropp'd on. But if a sword can be melted in the scabbard, and\r\nmoney in a man's pocket, by lightning, without burning either, it must be a\r\ncold fusion.\r\n\r\n55. Lightning rends some bodies. The electrical spark will strike a hole\r\nthro' a quire of strong paper.\r\n\r\n56. If the source of lightning, assigned in this paper, be the true one,\r\nthere should be little thunder heard at sea far from land. And accordingly\r\nsome old sea-captains, of whom enquiry has been made, do affirm, that the\r\nfact agrees perfectly with the hypothesis; for that, in crossing the great\r\nocean, they seldom meet with thunder till they come into soundings; and\r\nthat the islands far from the continent have very little of it. And a\r\ncurious observer, who lived 13 years at _Bermudas_, says, there was less\r\nthunder there in that whole time than he has sometimes heard in a month at\r\n_Carolina_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL PAPERS.\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nMr. PETER COLLINSON, F.R.S. _London_.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, _July 29, 1750_\r\n\r\n  _SIR_,\r\n\r\nAs you first put us on electrical experiments, by sending to our library\r\ncompany a tube, with directions how to use it; and as our honourable\r\nproprietary enabled us to carry those experiments to a greater height, by\r\nhis generous present of a compleat electrical apparatus; 'tis fit that both\r\nshould know from time to time what progress we make. It was in this view I\r\nwrote and sent you my former papers on this subject, desiring, that as I\r\nhad not the honour of a direct correspondence with that bountiful\r\nbenefactor to our library, they might be communicated to him through your\r\nhands. In the same view I write, and send you this additional paper. If it\r\nhappens to bring you nothing new (which may well be, considering the number\r\nof ingenious men in _Europe_, continually engaged in the same researches)\r\nat least it will show, that the instruments, put into our hands, are not\r\nneglected; and, that if no valuable discoveries are made by us, whatever\r\nthe cause may be, it is not want of industry and application.\r\n\r\n  _I am, Sir,\r\n    Your much obliged\r\n      Humble Servant_,\r\n        B. FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPINIONS and CONJECTURES,\r\n_Concerning the Properties and Effects of the electrical Matter, arising\r\nfrom Experiments and Observations, made in_ Philadelphia, 1749.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. The electrical matter consists of particles extreamly subtile, since\r\nit can permeate common matter, even the densest metals, with such ease and\r\nfreedom, as not to receive any perceptible resistance.\r\n\r\n2. If any one should doubt, whether the electrical matter passes thro' the\r\nsubstance of bodies, or only over and along their surfaces, a shock from an\r\nelectrified large glass jar, taken thro' his own body, will probably\r\nconvince him.\r\n\r\n3. Electrical matter differs from common matter in this, that the parts of\r\nthe latter mutually attract, those of the former mutually repel, each\r\nother. Hence the appearing divergency in a stream of electrified effluvia.\r\n\r\n4. But tho' the particles of electrical matter do repel each other, they\r\nare strongly attracted by all other matter.[7]\r\n\r\n5. From these three things, the extreme subtilty of the electrical matter,\r\nthe mutual repulsion of its parts, and the strong attraction between them\r\nand other matter, arise this effect, that when a quantity of electrical\r\nmatter, is applied to a mass of common matter, of any bigness or length\r\nwithin our observation (which has not already got its quantity) it is\r\nimmediately and equally diffused through the whole.\r\n\r\n6. Thus common matter is a kind of spunge to the electrical fluid. And as a\r\nspunge would receive no water, if the parts of water were not smaller than\r\nthe pores of the spunge; and even then but slowly, if there were not a\r\nmutual attraction between those parts and the parts of the spunge; and\r\nwould still imbibe it faster, if the mutual attraction among the parts of\r\nthe water did not impede, some force being required to separate them; and\r\nfastest, if, instead of attraction, there were a mutual repulsion among\r\nthose parts, which would act in conjunction with the attraction of the\r\nspunge. So is the case between the electrical and common matter.\r\n\r\n7. But in common matter there is (generally) as much of the electrical, as\r\nit will contain within its substance. If more is added, it lies without\r\nupon the surface, and forms what we call an electrical atmosphere: and then\r\nthe body is said to be electrified.\r\n\r\n8. 'Tis supposed, that all kinds of common matter do not attract and retain\r\nthe electrical, with equal strength and force; for reasons to be given\r\nhereafter. And that those called electrics _per se_, as glass, &c. attract\r\nand retain it strongest, and contain the greatest quantity.\r\n\r\n9. We know that the electrical fluid is _in_ common matter, because we can\r\npump it _out_ by the globe or tube. We know that common matter has near as\r\nmuch as it can contain, because, when we add a little more to any protion\r\nof it, the additional quantity does not enter, but forms an electrical\r\natmosphere. And we know that common matter has not (generally) more than it\r\ncan contain, otherwise all loose portions of it would repel each other, as\r\nthey constantly do when they have electric atmospheres.\r\n\r\n10. The beneficial uses of this electrical fluid in the creation, we are\r\nnot yet well acquainted with, though doubtless such there are, and those\r\nvery considerable; but we may see some pernicious consequences, that would\r\nattend a much greater proportion of it. For had this globe we live on as\r\nmuch of it in proportion, as we can give to a globe of iron, wood, or the\r\nlike, the particles of dust and other light matters that get loose from it,\r\nwould, by virtue of their separate electrical atmospheres, not only repel\r\neach other, but be repelled from the earth, and not easily be brought to\r\nunite with it again; whence our air would continually be more and more\r\nclogged with foreign matter, and grow unfit for respiration. This affords\r\nanother occasion of adoring that wisdom which has made all things by weight\r\nand measure!\r\n\r\n11. If a piece of common matter be supposed intirely free from electrical\r\nmatter, and a single particle of the latter be brought nigh, 'twill be\r\nattracted and enter the body, and take place in the center, or where the\r\nattraction is every way equal. If more particles enter, they take their\r\nplaces where the balance is equal between the attraction of the common\r\nmatter and their own mutual repulsion. 'Tis supposed they form triangles,\r\nwhose sides shorten as their number increases; 'till the common matter has\r\ndrawn in so many, that its whole power of compressing those triangles by\r\nattraction, is equal to their whole power of expanding themselves by\r\nrepulsion; and then will such piece of matter receive no more.\r\n\r\n12. When part of this natural proportion of electrical fluid, is taken out\r\nof a piece of common matter, the triangles formed by the remainder, are\r\nsupposed to widen by the mutual repulsion of the parts, until they occupy\r\nthe whole piece.\r\n\r\n13. When the quantity of electrical fluid taken from a piece of common\r\nmatter is restored again, it enters, the expanded triangles being again\r\ncompressed till there is room for the whole.\r\n\r\n14. To explain this: take two apples, or two balls of wood or other matter,\r\neach having its own natural quantity of the electrical fluid. Suspend them\r\nby silk lines from the ceiling. Apply the wire of a well-charged vial, held\r\nin your hand, to one of them (A) Fig. 7. and it will receive from the wire\r\na quantity of the electrical fluid; but will not imbibe it, being already\r\nfull. The fluid therefore will flow round its surface, and form an\r\nelectrical atmosphere. Bring A into contact with B, and half the electrical\r\nfluid is communicated, so that each has now an electrical atmosphere, and\r\ntherefore they repel each other. Take away these atmospheres by touching\r\nthe balls, and leave them in their natural state: then, having fixed a\r\nstick of sealing wax to the middle of the vial to hold it by, apply the\r\nwire to A, at the same time the coating touches B. Thus will a quantity of\r\nthe electrical fluid be drawn out of B, and thrown on A. So that A will\r\nhave a redundance of this fluid, which forms an atmosphere round it, and B\r\nan exactly equal deficiency. Now bring these balls again into contact, and\r\nthe electrical atmosphere will not be divided between A and B, into two\r\nsmaller atmospheres as before; for B will drink up the whole atmosphere of\r\nA, and both will be found again in their natural state.\r\n\r\n15. The form of the electrical atmosphere is that of the body it surrounds.\r\nThis shape may be rendered visible in a still air, by raising a smoke from\r\ndry rosin, dropt into a hot tea-spoon under the electrised body, which will\r\nbe attracted and spread itself equaly on all sides, covering and concealing\r\nthe body. And this form it takes, because it is attracted by all parts of\r\nthe surface of the body, tho' it cannot enter the substance already\r\nreplete. Without this attraction it would not remain round the body, but\r\ndissipate in the air.\r\n\r\n16. The atmosphere of electrical particles surrounding an electrified\r\nsphere, is not more disposed to leave it or more easily drawn off from any\r\none part of the sphere than from another, because it is equally attracted\r\nby every part. But that is not the case with bodies of any other figure.\r\nFrom a cube it is more easily drawn at the corners than at the plane sides,\r\nand so from the angles of a body of any other form, and still most easily\r\nfrom the angle that is most acute. Thus if a body shaped as A, B, C, D, E,\r\nin Fig. 8, be electrified, or have an electrical atmosphere communicated to\r\nit, and we consider every side as a base on which the particles rest and by\r\nwhich they are attracted, one may see, by imagining a line from A to F, and\r\nanother from E to G, that the portion of the atmosphere included in F, A,\r\nE, G, has the line A, E, for its basis. So the portion of atmosphere\r\nincluded in H, A, B, I, has the line A, B, for its basis. And likewise the\r\nportion included in K, B, C, L, has B, C, to rest on; and so on the other\r\nside of the figure. Now if you would draw off this atmosphere with any\r\nblunt smooth body, and approach the middle of the side A, B, you must come\r\nvery near before the force of your attracter exceeds the force or power\r\nwith which that side holds its atmosphere. But there is a small portion\r\nbetween I, B, K, that has less of the surface to rest on, and to be\r\nattracted by, than the neighbouring portions, while at the same time there\r\nis a mutual repulsion between its particles and the particles of those\r\nportions, therefore here you can get it with more ease or at a greater\r\ndistance. Between F, A, H, there is a larger portion that has yet a less\r\nsurface to rest on and to attract it; here therefore you can get it away\r\nstill more easily. But easiest of all between L, C, M, where the quantity\r\nis largest, and the surface to attract and keep it back the least. When you\r\nhave drawn away one of these angular portions of the fluid, another\r\nsucceeds in its place, from the nature of fluidity and the mutual repulsion\r\nbeforementioned; and so the atmosphere continues flowing off at such angle,\r\nlike a stream, till no more is remaining. The extremities of the portions\r\nof atmosphere over these angular parts are likewise at a greater distance\r\nfrom the electrified body, as may be seen by the inspection of the above\r\nfigure; the point of the atmosphere of the angle C, being much farther from\r\nC, than any other part of the atmosphere over the lines C, B, or B, A: And\r\nbesides the distance arising from the nature of the figure, where the\r\nattraction is less, the particles will naturally expand to a greater\r\ndistance by their mutual repulsion. On these accounts we suppose\r\nelectrified bodies discharge their atmospheres upon unelectrified bodies\r\nmore easily and at a greater distance from their angles and points than\r\nfrom their smooth sides.--Those points will also discharge into the air,\r\nwhen the body has too great an electrical atmosphere, without bringing any\r\nnon-electric near, to receive what is thrown off: For the air, though an\r\nelectric _per se_, yet has always more or less water and other non-electric\r\nmatters mixed with it; and these attract and receive what is so discharged.\r\n\r\n17. But points have a property, by which they _draw on_ as well as _throw\r\noff_ the electrical fluid, at greater distances than blunt bodies can. That\r\nis, as the pointed part of an electrified body will discharge the\r\natmosphere of that body, or communicate it farthest to another body, so the\r\npoint of an unelectrified body, will draw off the electrical atmosphere\r\nfrom an electrified body, farther than a blunter part of the same\r\nunelectrified body will do. Thus a pin held by the head, and the point\r\npresented to an electrified body, will draw off its atmosphere at a foot\r\ndistance; where if the head were presented instead of the point, no such\r\neffect would follow. To understand this, we may consider, that if a person\r\nstanding on the floor would draw off the electrical atmosphere from an\r\nelectrified body, an iron crow and a blunt knitting kneedle held\r\nalternately in his hand and presented for that purpose, do not draw with\r\ndifferent forces in proportion to their different masses. For the man, and\r\nwhat he holds in his hand, be it large or small, are connected with the\r\ncommon mass of unelectrified matter; and the force with which he draws is\r\nthe same in both cases, it consisting in the different proportion of\r\nelectricity in the electrified body and that common mass. But the force\r\nwith which the electrified body retains its atmosphere by attracting it, is\r\nproportioned to the surface over which the particles are placed; i.e. four\r\nsquare inches of that surface retain their atmosphere with four times the\r\nforce that one square inch retains its atmosphere. And as in plucking the\r\nhairs from the horse's tail, a degree of strength insufficient to pull away\r\na handful at once, could yet easily strip it hair by hair; so a blunt body\r\npresented cannot draw off a number of particles at once, but a pointed one,\r\nwith no greater force, takes them away easily, particle by particle.\r\n\r\n18. These explanations of the power and operation of points, when they\r\nfirst occurr'd to me, and while they first floated in my mind, appeared\r\nperfectly satisfactory; but now I have wrote them, and consider'd them more\r\nclosely in black and white, I must own I have some doubts about them: yet\r\nas I have at present nothing better to offer in their stead, I do not cross\r\nthem out: for even a bad solution read, and its faults discover'd, has\r\noften given rise to a good one in the mind of an ingenious reader.\r\n\r\n19. Nor is it of much importance to us, to know the manner in which nature\r\nexecutes her laws; 'tis enough if we know the laws themselves. 'Tis of real\r\nuse to know, that china left in the air unsupported will fall and break;\r\nbut _how_ it comes to fall, and _why_ it breaks, are matters of\r\nspeculation. 'Tis a pleasure indeed to know them, but we can preserve our\r\nchina without it.\r\n\r\n20. Thus in the present case, to know this power of points, may possibly be\r\nof some use to mankind, though we should never be able to explain it. The\r\nfollowing experiments, as well as those in my first paper, show this power.\r\nI have a large prime conductor made of several thin sheets of Fuller's\r\npasteboard form'd into a tube, near 10 feet long and a foot diameter. It is\r\ncover'd with _Dutch_ emboss'd paper, almost totally gilt. This large\r\nmetallic surface supports a much greater electrical atmosphere than a rod\r\nof iron of 50 times the weight would do. It is suspended by silk lines, and\r\nwhen charg'd will strike at near two inches distance, a pretty hard stroke\r\nso as to make one's knuckle ach. Let a person standing on the floor present\r\nthe point of a needle at 12 or more inches distance from it, and while the\r\nneedle is so presented, the conductor cannot be charged, the point drawing\r\noff the fire as fast as it is thrown on by the electrical globe. Let it be\r\ncharged, and then present the point at the same distance, and it will\r\nsuddenly be discharged. In the dark you may see a light on the point, when\r\nthe experiment is made. And if the person holding the point stands upon\r\nwax, he will be electrified by receiving the fire at that distance. Attempt\r\nto draw off the electricity with a blunt body, as a bolt of iron round at\r\nthe end and smooth (a silversmith's iron punch, inch-thick, is what I use)\r\nand you must bring it within the distance of three inches before you can do\r\nit, and then it is done with a stroke and crack. As the pasteboard tube\r\nhangs loose on silk lines, when you approach it with the punch iron, it\r\nlikewise will move towards the punch, being attracted while it is charged;\r\nbut if at the same instant a point be presented as before, it retires\r\nagain, for the point discharges it. Take a pair of large brass scales, of\r\ntwo or more feet beam, the cords of the scales being silk. Suspend the beam\r\nby a packthread from the cieling, so that the bottom of the scales may be\r\nabout a foot from the floor: The scales will move round in a circle by the\r\nuntwisting of the packthread. Set the iron punch on the end upon the floor,\r\nin such a place as that the scales may pass over it in making their circle:\r\nThen electrify one scale by applying the wire of a charged phial to it. As\r\nthey move round, you see that scale draw nigher to the floor, and dip more\r\nwhen it comes over the punch; and if that be placed at a proper distance,\r\nthe scale will snap and discharge its fire into it. But if a needle be\r\nstuck on the end of the punch, its point upwards, the scale, instead of\r\ndrawing nigh to the punch and snapping, discharges its fire silently\r\nthrough the point, and rises higher from the punch. Nay, even if the needle\r\nbe placed upon the floor near the punch, its point upwards, the end of the\r\npunch, tho' so much higher than the needle, will not attract the scale and\r\nreceive its fire, for the needle will get it and convey it away, before it\r\ncomes nigh enough for the punch to act. And this is constantly observable\r\nin these experiments, that the greater quantity of electricity on the\r\npasteboard tube, the farther it strikes or discharges its fire, and the\r\npoint likewise will draw it off at a still greater distance.\r\n\r\nNow if the fire of electricity and that of lightening be the same, as I\r\nhave endeavour'd to show at large in a former paper, this pasteboard tube\r\nand these scales may represent electrified clouds. If a tube of only 10\r\nfeet long will strike and discharge its fire on the punch at two or three\r\ninches distance, an electrified cloud of perhaps 10,000 acres, may strike\r\nand discharge on the earth at a proportionably greater distance. The\r\nhorizontal motion of the scales over the floor, may represent the motion of\r\nthe clouds over the earth; and the erect iron punch, a hill or high\r\nbuilding; and then we see how electrified clouds passing over hills or high\r\nbuildings at too great a height to strike, may be attracted lower till\r\nwithin their striking distance. And lastly, if a needle fix'd on the punch\r\nwith its point upright, or even on the floor below the punch, will draw the\r\nfire from the scale silently at a much greater than the striking distance,\r\nand so prevent its descending towards the punch; or if in its course it\r\nwould have come nigh enough to strike, yet being first deprived of its fire\r\nit cannot, and the punch is thereby secured from the stroke. I say, if\r\nthese things are so, may not the knowledge of this power of points be of\r\nuse to mankind, in preserving houses, churches, ships, &c. from the stroke\r\nof lightning, by directing us to fix on the highest parts of those\r\nedifices, upright rods of iron made sharp as a needle, and gilt to prevent\r\nrusting, and from the foot of those rods a wire down the outside of the\r\nbuilding into the ground, or down round one of the shrouds of a ship, and\r\ndown her side till it reaches the water? Would not these pointed rods\r\nprobably draw the electrical fire silently out of a cloud before it came\r\nnigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and\r\nterrible mischief?\r\n\r\n21. To determine the question, whether the clouds that contain lightning\r\nare electrified or not, I would propose an experiment to be try'd where it\r\nmay be done conveniently. On the top of some high tower or steeple, place a\r\nkind of sentry-box, (as in FIG. 9.) big enough to contain a man and an\r\nelectrical stand. From the middle of the stand, let an iron rod rise and\r\npass bending out of the door, and then upright 20 or 30 feet, pointed very\r\nsharp at the end. If the electrical stand be kept clean and dry, a man\r\nstanding on it when such clouds are passing low, might be electrified and\r\nafford sparks, the rod drawing fire to him from a cloud. If any danger to\r\nthe man should be apprehended (though I think there would be none) let him\r\nstand on the floor of his box, and now and then bring near to the rod, the\r\nloop of a wire that has one end fastened to the leads, he holding it by a\r\nwax handle; so the sparks, if the rod is electrified, will strike from the\r\nrod to the wire, and not affect him.\r\n\r\n22. Before I leave this subject of lightning, I may mention some other\r\nsimilarities between the effects of that, and these of electricity.\r\nLightning has often been known to strike people blind. A pigeon that we\r\nstruck dead to appearance by the electrical shock, recovering life, droop'd\r\nabout the yard several days, eat nothing though crumbs were thrown to it,\r\nbut declined and died. We did not think of its being deprived of sight; but\r\nafterwards a pullet struck dead in like manner, being recovered by\r\nrepeatedly blowing into its lungs, when set down on the floor, ran headlong\r\nagainst the wall, and on examination appeared perfectly blind. Hence we\r\nconcluded that the pigeon also had been absolutely blinded by the shock.\r\nThe biggest animal we have yet killed or try'd to kill with the electrical\r\nstroke, was a well-grown pullet.\r\n\r\n23. Reading in the ingenious Dr. _Hales_'s account of the thunder storm at\r\n_Stretham_, the effect of the lightning in stripping off all the paint that\r\nhad covered a gilt moulding of a pannel of wainscot, without hurting the\r\nrest of the paint, I had a mind to lay a coat of paint over the filleting\r\nof gold on the cover of a book, and try the effect of a strong electrical\r\nflash sent through that gold from a charged sheet of glass. But having no\r\npaint at hand, I pasted a narrow strip of paper over it; and when dry, sent\r\nthe flash through the gilding; by which the paper was torn off from end to\r\nend, with such force, that it was broke in several places, and in others\r\nbrought away part of the grain of the Turky-leather in which it was bound;\r\nand convinced me, that had it been painted, the paint would have been\r\nstript off in the same manner with that on the wainscot at _Stretham_.\r\n\r\n24. Lightning melts metals, and I hinted in my paper on that subject, that\r\nI suspected it to be a cold fusion; I do not mean a fusion by force of\r\ncold, but a fusion without heat. We have also melted gold, silver, and\r\ncopper, in small quantities, by the electrical flash. The manner is this:\r\nTake leaf gold, leaf silver, or leaf gilt copper, commonly called leaf\r\nbrass or _Dutch_ gold: cut off from the leaf long narrow strips the breadth\r\nof a straw. Place one of these strips between two strips of smooth glass\r\nthat are about the width of your finger. If one strip of gold, the length\r\nof the leaf, be not long enough for the glass, add another to the end of\r\nit, so that you may have a little part hanging out loose at each end of the\r\nglass. Bind the pieces of glass together from end to end with strong silk\r\nthread; then place it so as to be part of an electrical circle, (the ends\r\nof gold hanging out being of use to join with the other parts of the\r\ncircle) and send the flash through it, from a large electrified jar or\r\nsheet of glass. Then if your strips of glass remain whole, you will see\r\nthat the gold is missing in several places, and instead of it a metallic\r\nstain on both the glasses; the stains on the upper and under glass exactly\r\nsimilar in the minutest stroke, as may be seen by holding them to the\r\nlight; the metal appeared to have been not only melted, but even vitrified,\r\nor otherwise so driven into the pores of the glass, as to be protected by\r\nit from the action of the strongest _Aqua Fortis_ and _Ag: Regia_. I send\r\nyou enclosed two little pieces of glass with these metallic stains upon\r\nthem, which cannot be removed without taking part of the glass with them.\r\nSometimes the stain spreads a little wider than the breadth of the leaf,\r\nand looks brighter at the edge, as by inspecting closely you may observe in\r\nthese. Sometimes the glass breaks to pieces: once the upper glass broke\r\ninto a thousand pieces, looking like coarse salt. These pieces I send you,\r\nwere stain'd with _Dutch_ gold. True gold makes a darker stain, somewhat\r\nreddish; silver, a greenish stain. We once took two pieces of thick\r\nlooking-glass, as broad as a Gunter's scale, and 6 inches long; and placing\r\nleaf gold between them, put them betwixt two smoothly plain'd pieces of\r\nwood, and fix'd them tight in a book-binder's small press; yet though they\r\nwere so closely confined, the force of the electrical shock shivered the\r\nglass into many pieces. The gold was melted and stain'd into the glass as\r\nusual. The circumstances of the breaking of the glass differ much in making\r\nthe experiment, and sometimes it does not break at all: but this is\r\nconstant, that the stains in the upper and under pieces are exact\r\ncounterparts of each other. And though I have taken up the pieces of glass\r\nbetween my fingers immediately after this melting, I never could perceive\r\nthe least warmth in them.\r\n\r\n25. In one of my former papers, I mention'd, that gilding on a book, though\r\nat first it communicated the shock perfectly well, yet fail'd after a few\r\nexperiments, which we could not account for. We have since found, that one\r\nstrong shock breaks the continuity of the gold in the filleting, and makes\r\nit look rather like dust of gold, abundance of its parts being broken and\r\ndriven off; and it will seldom conduct above one strong shock. Perhaps this\r\nmay be the reason; when there is not a perfect continuity in the circle,\r\nthe fire must leap over the vacancies; there is a certain distance which it\r\nis able to leap over according to its strength; if a number of small\r\nvacancies, though each be very minute, taken together exceed that distance,\r\nit cannot leap over them, and so the shock is prevented.\r\n\r\n26. From the before mentioned law of electricity, that points, as they are\r\nmore or less acute, draw on and throw off the electrical fluid with more or\r\nless power, and at greater or less distances, and in larger or smaller\r\nquantities in the same time, we may see how to account for the situation of\r\nthe leaf of gold suspended between two plates, the upper one continually\r\nelectrified, the under one in a person's hand standing on the floor. When\r\nthe upper plate is electrified, the leaf is attracted and raised towards\r\nit, and would fly to that plate were it not for its own points. The corner\r\nthat happens to be uppermost when the leaf is rising, being a sharp point,\r\nfrom the extream thinness of the gold, draws and receives at a distance a\r\nsufficient quantity of the electrical fluid to give itself an electrical\r\natmosphere, by which its progress to the upper plate is stopt, and it\r\nbegins to be repelled from that plate, and would be driven back to the\r\nunder plate, but that its lowest corner is likewise a point, and throws off\r\nor discharges the overplus of the leaf's atmosphere, as fast as the upper\r\ncorner draws it on. Were these two points perfectly equal in acuteness, the\r\nleaf would take place exactly in the middle space, for its Weight is a\r\ntrifle, compared to the power acting on it: But it is generally nearest the\r\nunelectrified plate, because, when the leaf is offered to the electrified\r\nplate at a distance, the sharpest point is commonly first affected and\r\nraised towards it; so that point, from its greater acuteness, receiving the\r\nfluid faster than its opposite can discharge it at equal distances, it\r\nretires from the electrified plate, and draws nearer to the unelectrified\r\nplate, till it comes to a distance where the discharge can be exactly equal\r\nto the receipt, the latter being lessened, and the former encreased; and\r\nthere it remains as long as the globe continues to supply fresh electrical\r\nmatter. This will appear plain, when the difference of acuteness in the\r\ncorners is made very great. Cut a piece of _Dutch_ gold (which is fittest\r\nfor these experiments on account of its greater strength) into the form of\r\nFIG. 10 the upper corner a right angle, the two next obtuse angles, and the\r\nlowest a very acute one; and bring this on your plate under the electrified\r\nplate, in such a manner as that the right-angled part may be first raised\r\n(which is done by covering the acute part with the hollow of your hand) and\r\nyou will see this leaf take place much nearer to the upper than to the\r\nunder plate; because, without being nearer, it cannot receive so fast at\r\nits right-angled point, as it can discharge at its acute one. Turn this\r\nleaf with the acute part uppermost, and then it takes place nearest the\r\nunelectrified plate, because otherwise it receives faster at its acute\r\npoint than it can discharge at its right-angled one. Thus the difference of\r\ndistance is always proportioned to the difference of acuteness. Take care\r\nin cutting your leaf to leave no little ragged particles on the edges,\r\nwhich sometimes form points where you would not have them. You may make\r\nthis figure so acute below and blunt above, as to need no under plate, it\r\ndischarging fast enough into the air. When it is made narrower, as the\r\nfigure between the pricked lines, we call it the _Golden Fish_, from its\r\nmanner of acting. For if you take it by the tail, and hold it at a foot or\r\ngreater horizontal distance from the prime conductor, it will, when let go,\r\nfly to it with a brisk but wavering motion, like that of an eel through the\r\nwater; it will then take place under the prime conductor, at perhaps a\r\nquarter or half an inch distance, and keep a continual shaking of its tail\r\nlike a fish, so that it seems animated. Turn its tail towards the prime\r\nconductor, and then it flies to your finger, and seems to nibble it. And if\r\nyou hold a plate under it at six or eight inches distance, and cease\r\nturning the Globe, when the electrical atmosphere of the conductor grows\r\nsmall, it will descend to the plate and swim back again several times with\r\nthe same fish-like motion, greatly to the entertainment of spectators. By a\r\nlittle practice in blunting or sharpening the heads or tails of these\r\nfigures, you may make them take place as desired, nearer, or farther from\r\nthe electrified plate.\r\n\r\n27. It is said in section 8, of this paper, that all kinds of common matter\r\nare supposed not to attract the electrical fluid with equal strength; and\r\nthat those called electrics _per se_, as glass, &c. attract and retain it\r\nstrongest, and contain the greatest quantity. This latter position may seem\r\na paradox to some, being contrary to the hitherto received opinion; and\r\ntherefore I shall now endeavour to explain it.\r\n\r\n28. In order to this, let it first be considered, _that we cannot, by any\r\nmeans we are yet acquainted with, force the electrical fluid thro' glass_.\r\nI know it is commonly thought that it easily pervades glass, and the\r\nexperiment of a feather suspended by a thread in a bottle hermetically\r\nsealed, yet moved by bringing a nibbed tube near the outside of the bottle,\r\nis alledged to prove it. But, if the electrical fluid so easily pervades\r\nglass, how does the vial become _charged_ (as we term it) when we hold it\r\nin our hands? Would not the fire thrown in by the wire pass through to our\r\nhands, and so escape into the floor? Would not the bottle in that case be\r\nleft just as we found it, uncharged, as we know a metal bottle so attempted\r\nto be charged would be? Indeed, if there be the least crack, the minutest\r\nsolution of continuity in the glass, though it remains so tight that\r\nnothing else we know of will pass, yet the extremely subtile electrical\r\nfluid flies through such a crack with the greatest freedom, and such a\r\nbottle we know can never be charged: What then makes the difference between\r\nsuch a bottle and one that is sound, but this, that the fluid can pass\r\nthrough the one, and not through the other?[8]\r\n\r\n29. It is true there is an experiment that at first sight would be apt to\r\nsatisfy a slight observer, that the fire thrown into the bottle by the\r\nwire, does really pass thro' the glass. It is this: place the bottle on a\r\nglass stand, under the prime conductor; suspend a bullet by a chain from\r\nthe prime conductor, till it comes within a quarter of an inch right over\r\nthe wire of the bottle; place your knuckle on the glass stand, at just the\r\nsame distance from the coating of the bottle, as the bullet is from its\r\nwire. Now let the globe be turned, and you see a spark strike from the\r\nbullet to the wire of the bottle, and the same instant you see and feel an\r\nexactly equal spark striking from the coating on your knuckle, and so on\r\nspark for spark. This looks as if the whole received by the bottle was\r\nagain discharged from it. And yet the bottle by this means is charged![9]\r\nAnd therefore the fire that thus leaves the bottle, though the same in\r\nquantity, cannot be the very same fire that entered at the wire; for if it\r\nwere, the bottle would remain uncharged.\r\n\r\n30. If the fire that so leaves the bottle be not the same that is thrown in\r\nthrough the wire, it must be fire that subsisted in the bottle, (that is,\r\nin the glass of the bottle) before the operation began.\r\n\r\n31. If so, there must be a great quantity in glass, because a great\r\nquantity is thus discharged even from very thin glass.\r\n\r\n32. That this electrical fluid or fire is strongly attracted by glass, we\r\nknow from the quickness and violence with which it is resumed by the part\r\nthat had been deprived of it, when there is an opportunity. And by this,\r\nthat we cannot from a mass of glass draw a quantity of electrical fire, or\r\nelectrify the whole mass _minus_, as we can a mass of metal. We cannot\r\nlessen or increase its whole quantity, for the quantity it has it holds;\r\nand it has as much as it can hold. Its pores are filled with it as full as\r\nthe mutual repellency of the particles will admit; and what is already in,\r\nrefuses, or strongly repels, any additional quantity. Nor have we any way\r\nof moving the electrical fluid in glass, but one; that is, by covering part\r\nof the two surfaces of thin glass with non-electrics, and then throwing an\r\nadditional quantity of this fluid on one surface, which spreading in the\r\nnon-electric, and being bound by it to that surface, acts by its repelling\r\nforce on the particles of the electrical fluid contained in the other\r\nsurface, and drives them out of the glass into the non-electric on that\r\nside, from whence they are discharged, and then those added on the charged\r\nside can enter. But when this is done, there is no more in the glass, nor\r\nless than before, just as much having left it on one side as it received on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n33. I feel a want of terms here, and doubt much whether I shall be able to\r\nmake this part intelligible. By the word _surface_, in this case, I do not\r\nmean mere length and breadth without thickness; but when I speak of the\r\nupper or under surface of a piece of glass, the outer or inner surface of\r\nthe vial, I mean length, breadth, and half the thickness, and beg the\r\nfavour of being so understood. Now, I suppose, that glass in its first\r\nprinciples, and in the Furnace, has no more of this electrical fluid than\r\nother common matter: That when it is blown, as it cools, and the particles\r\nof common fire leave it, its pores become a vacuum: That the component\r\nparts of glass are extremely small and fine, I guess from its never showing\r\na rough face when it breaks, but always a polish; and from the smallness of\r\nits particles I suppose the pores between them must be exceeding small,\r\nwhich is the reason that Aqua-fortis, nor any other menstruum we have, can\r\nenter to separate them and dissolve the substance; nor is any fluid we know\r\nof, fine enough to enter, except common fire, and the electrical fluid. Now\r\nthe departing fire leaving a vacuum, as aforesaid, between these pores,\r\nwhich air nor water are fine enough to enter and fill, the electrical fluid\r\n(which is every where ready in what we call the non-electrics, and in the\r\nnon-electric Mixtures that are in the air,) is attracted in: yet does not\r\nbecome fixed with the substance of the glass, but subsists there as water\r\nin a porous stone, retained only by the attraction of the fixed parts,\r\nitself still loose and a fluid. But I suppose farther, that in the cooling\r\nof the glass, its texture becomes closest in the middle, and forms a kind\r\nof partition, in which the pores are so narrow, that the particles of the\r\nelectrical fluid, which enter both surfaces at the same time, cannot go\r\nthrough, or pass and repass from one surface to the other, and so mix\r\ntogether; yet, though the particles of electrical fluid, imbibed by each\r\nsurface, cannot themselves pass through to those of the other, their\r\nrepellency can, and by this means they act on one another. The particles of\r\nthe electrical fluid have a mutual repellency, but by the power of\r\nattraction in the glass they are condensed or forced nearer to each other.\r\nWhen the glass has received and, by its attraction, forced closer together\r\nso much of this electrified fluid, as that the power of attracting and\r\ncondensing in the one, is equal to the power of expansion in the other, it\r\ncan imbibe no more, and that remains its constant whole quantity; but each\r\nsurface would receive more, if the repellency of what is in the opposite\r\nsurface did not resist its entrance. The quantities of this fluid in each\r\nsurface being equal, their repelling action on each other is equal; and\r\ntherefore those of one surface cannot drive out those of the other: but, if\r\na greater quantity is forced into one surface than the glass would\r\nnaturally draw in; this increases the repelling power on that side, and\r\noverpowering the attraction on the other, drives out part of the fluid that\r\nhad been imbibed by that surface, if there be any non-electric ready to\r\nreceive it: such there is in all cases where glass is electrified to give a\r\nshock. The surface that has been thus emptied by having its electrical\r\nfluid driven out, resumes again an equal quantity with violence, as soon as\r\nthe glass has an opportunity to discharge that over-quantity more than it\r\ncould retain by attraction in its other surface, by the additional\r\nrepellency of which the vacuum had been occasioned. For experiments\r\nfavouring (if I may not say confirming) this hypothesis, I must, to avoid\r\nrepetition, beg leave to refer you back to what is said of the electrical\r\nphial in my former papers.\r\n\r\n34. Let us now see how it will account for several other\r\nappearances.--Glass, a body extremely elastic (and perhaps its elasticity\r\nmay be owing in some degree to the subsisting of so great a quantity of\r\nthis repelling fluid in its pores) must, when rubbed, have its rubbed\r\nsurface somewhat stretched, or its solid parts drawn a little farther\r\nasunder, so that the vacancies in which the electrical fluid resides,\r\nbecome larger, affording room for more of that fluid, which is immediately\r\nattracted into it from the cushion or hand rubbing, they being supply'd\r\nfrom the common stock. But the instant the parts of the glass so open'd and\r\nfill'd have pass'd the friction, they close again, and force the additional\r\nquantity out upon the surface, where it must rest till that part comes\r\nround to the cushion again, unless some non electric (as the prime\r\nconductor) first presents to receive it.[10] But if the inside of the globe\r\nbe lined with a non-electric, the additional repellency of the electrical\r\nfluid, thus collected by friction on the rubb'd part of the globe's outer\r\nsurface, drives an equal quantity out of the inner surface into that\r\nnon-electric lining, which receiving it, and carrying it away from the\r\nrubb'd part into the common mass, through the axis of the globe and frame\r\nof the machine, the new collected electrical fluid can enter and remain in\r\nthe outer surface, and none of it (or a very little) will be received by\r\nthe prime conductor. As this charg'd part of the globe comes round to the\r\ncushion again, the outer surface delivers its overplus fire into the\r\ncushion, the opposite inner surface receiving at the same time an equal\r\nquantity from the floor. Every electrician knows that a globe wet within\r\nwill afford little or no fire, but the reason has not before been attempted\r\nto be given, that I know of.\r\n\r\n34. So if a tube lined with a [11]non-electric, be rubb'd, little or no\r\nfire is obtained from it. What is collected from the hand in the downward\r\nrubbing stroke, entering the pores of the glass, and driving an equal\r\nquantity out of the inner surface into the non-electric lining: and the\r\nhand in passing up to take a second stroke, takes out again what had been\r\nthrown into the outer surface, and then the inner surface receives back\r\nagain what it had given to the non-electric lining. Thus the particles of\r\nelectrical fluid belonging to the inside surface go in and out of their\r\npores every stroke given to the tube. Put a wire into the tube, the inward\r\nend in contact with the non-electric lining, so it will represent the\r\n_Leyden_ bottle. Let a second person touch the wire while you rub, and the\r\nfire driven out of the inward surface when you give the stroke, will pass\r\nthrough him into the common mass, and return through him when the inner\r\nsurface resumes its quantity, and therefore this new kind of _Leyden_\r\nbottle cannot so be charged. But thus it may: after every stroke, before\r\nyou pass your hand up to make another, let the second person apply his\r\nfinger to the wire, take the spark, and then withdraw his finger; and so on\r\ntill he has drawn a number of sparks; thus will the inner surface be\r\nexhausted, and the outer surface charged; then wrap a sheet of gilt paper\r\nclose round the outer surface, and grasping it in your hand you may receive\r\na shock by applying the finger of the other hand to the wire: for now the\r\nvacant pores in the inner surface resume their quantity, and the\r\novercharg'd pores in the outer surface discharge that overplus; the\r\nequilibrium being restored through your body, which could not be restored\r\nthrough the glass.[12] If the tube be exhausted of air, a non electric\r\nlining in contact with the wire is not necessary; for _in vacuo_, the\r\nelectrical fire will fly freely from the inner surface, without a\r\nnon-electric conductor: but air resists its motion; for being itself an\r\nelectric _per se_, it does not attract it, having already its quantity. So\r\nthe air never draws off an electric atmosphere from any body, but in\r\nproportion to the non-electrics mix'd with it: it rather keeps such an\r\natmosphere confin'd, which from the mutual repulsion of its particles,\r\ntends to dissipation, and would immediately dissipate _in vacuo_.--And thus\r\nthe experiment of the feather inclosed in a glass vessel hermetically\r\nsealed, but moving on the approach of the rubbed tube, is explained: When\r\nan additional quantity of the electrical fluid is applied to the side of\r\nthe vessel by the atmosphere of the tube, a quantity is repelled and driven\r\nout of the inner surface of that side into the vessel, and there affects\r\nthe feather, returning again into its pores, when the tube with its\r\natmosphere is withdrawn; not that the particles of that atmosphere did\r\nthemselves pass through the glass to the feather.----And every other\r\nappearance I have yet seen, in which glass and electricity are concern'd,\r\nare, I think, explain'd with equal ease by the same hypothesis. Yet,\r\nperhaps, it may not be a true one, and I shall be obliged to him that\r\naffords me a better.\r\n\r\n35. Thus I take the difference between non electrics and glass, an electric\r\n_per se_, to consist in these two particulars. 1st, That a non-electric\r\neasily suffers a change in the quantity of the electrical fluid it\r\ncontains. You may lessen its whole quantity by drawing out a part, which\r\nthe whole body will again resume; but of glass you can only lessen the\r\nquantity contain'd in one of its surfaces; and not that, but by supplying\r\nan equal quantity at the same time to the other surface; so that the whole\r\nglass may always have the same quantity in the two surfaces, their two\r\ndifferent quantities being added together. And this can only be done in\r\nglass that is thin; beyond a certain thickness we have yet no power that\r\ncan make this change. And, 2dly, that the electrical fire freely removes\r\nfrom place to place, in and through the substance of a non-electric, but\r\nnot so through the substance of glass. If you offer a quantity to one end\r\nof a long rod of metal, it receives it, and when it enters, every particle\r\nthat was before in the rod, pushes its neighbour quite to the further end,\r\nwhere the overplus is discharg'd; and this instantaneously where the rod is\r\npart of the circle in the experiment of the shock. But glass, from the\r\nsmallness of its pores, or stronger attraction of what it contains, refuses\r\nto admit so free a motion; a glass rod will not conduct a shock, nor will\r\nthe thinnest glass suffer any particle entring one of its surfaces to pass\r\nthro' to the other.\r\n\r\n36. Hence we see the impossibility of success, in the experiments propos'd,\r\nto draw out the effluvial virtues of a non-electric, as cinnamon for\r\ninstance, and mixing them with the electrical fluid, to convey them with\r\nthat into the body, by including it in the globe, and then applying\r\nfriction, etc. For though the effluvia of cinnamon, and the electrical\r\nfluid should mix within the globe, they would never come out together\r\nthrough the pores of the glass, and so go to the prime conductor; for the\r\nelectrical fluid itself cannot come through; and the prime conductor is\r\nalways supply'd from the cushion, and that from the floor. And besides,\r\nwhen the globe is filled with cinnamon, or other non-electric, no\r\nelectrical fluid can be obtain'd from its outer surface, for the reason\r\nbefore-mentioned. I have try'd another way, which I thought more likely to\r\nobtain a mixture of the electrical and other effluvia together, if such a\r\nmixture had been possible. I placed a glass plate under my cushion, to cut\r\noff the communication between the cushion and floor; then brought a small\r\nchain from the cushion into a glass of oil of turpentine, and carried\r\nanother chain from the oil of turpentine to the floor, taking care that the\r\nchain from the cushion to the glass touch'd no part of the frame of the\r\nmachine. Another chain was fix'd to the prime conductor, and held in the\r\nhand of a person to be electrised. The ends of the two chains in the glass\r\nwere near an inch distant from each other, the oil of turpentine between.\r\nNow the globe being turn'd, could draw no fire from the floor through the\r\nmachine, the communication that way being cut off by the thick glass plate\r\nunder the cushion: it must then draw it through the chains whose ends were\r\ndipt in the oil of turpentine. And as the oil of turpentine being an\r\nelectric _per se_, would not conduct what came up from the floor, was\r\nobliged to jump from the end of one chain, to the end of the other, through\r\nthe substance of that oil, which we could see in large sparks; and so it\r\nhad a fair opportunity of seizing some of the finest particles of the oil\r\nin its passage, and carrying them off with it: but no such effect followed,\r\nnor could I perceive the least difference in the smell of the electrical\r\neffluvia thus collected, from what it has when collected otherwise; nor\r\ndoes it otherwise affect the body of a person electrised. I likewise put\r\ninto a phial, instead of water, a strong purgative liquid, and then charged\r\nthe phial, and took repeated shocks from it, in which case every particle\r\nof the electrical fluid must, before it went through my body, have first\r\ngone through the liquid when the phial is charging, and returned through it\r\nwhen discharging, yet no other effect followed than if it had been charged\r\nwith water. I have also smelt the electrical fire when drawn through gold,\r\nsilver, copper, lead, iron, wood, and the human body, and could perceive no\r\ndifference; the odour is always the same where the spark does not burn what\r\nit strikes; and therefore I imagine it does not take that smell from any\r\nquality of the bodies it passes through. And indeed, as that smell so\r\nreadily leaves the electrical matter, and adheres to the knuckle receiving\r\nthe sparks, and to other things; I suspect that it never was connected with\r\nit, but arises instantaneously from something in the air acted upon by it.\r\nFor if it was fine enough to come with the electrical fluid through the\r\nbody of one person, why should it stop on the skin of another?\r\n\r\nBut I shall never have done, if I tell you all my conjectures, thoughts,\r\nand imaginations, on the nature and operations of this electrical fluid,\r\nand relate the variety of little experiments we have try'd. I have already\r\nmade this paper too long, for which I must crave pardon, not having now\r\ntime to make it shorter. I shall only add, that as it has been observed\r\nhere that spirits will fire by the electrical spark in the summer time,\r\nwithout heating them, when _Fahrenheit_'s thermometer is above 70; so, when\r\ncolder, if the operator puts a small flat bottle of spirits in his bosom,\r\nor a close pocket, with the spoon, some little time before he uses them,\r\nthe heat of his body will communicate warmth more than sufficient for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT, _proving that the_ Leyden Bottle _has no more\r\n  electrical Fire in it when charged, than before; nor less when\r\n  discharged: That in discharging, the Fire does not issue from the Wire\r\n  and the Coating at the same Time, as some have thought, but that the\r\n  Coating always receives what is discharged by the Wire, or an equal\r\n  Quantity; the outer Surface being always in a negative State of\r\n  Electricity, when the inner Surface is in a positive State_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace a thick plate of glass under the rubbing cushion, to cut off the\r\ncommunication of electrical fire from the floor to the cushion; then, if\r\nthere be no fine points or hairy threads sticking out from the cushion, or\r\nfrom the parts of the machine opposite to the cushion, (of which you must\r\nbe careful) you can get but a few sparks from the prime conductor, which\r\nare all the cushion will part with.\r\n\r\nHang a phial then on the prime conductor, and it will not charge, tho' you\r\nhold it by the coating.----But\r\n\r\nForm a communication by a chain from the coating to the cushion, and the\r\nphial will charge.\r\n\r\nFor the globe then draws the electrical fire out of the outside surface of\r\nthe phial, and forces it, through the prime conductor and wire of the\r\nphial, into the inside surface.\r\n\r\nThus the bottle is charged with its own fire, no other being to be had\r\nwhile the glass plate is under the cushion.\r\n\r\nHang two cork balls by flaxen threads to the prime conductor; then touch\r\nthe coating of the bottle, and they will be electrified and recede from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nFor just as much fire as you give the coating, so much is discharged\r\nthrough the wire upon the prime conductor, whence the cork balls receive an\r\nelectrical atmosphere. But\r\n\r\nTake a wire bent in the form of a C, with a stick of wax fixed to the\r\noutside of the curve, to hold it by; and apply one end of this wire to the\r\ncoating, and the other at the same time to the prime conductor, the phial\r\nwill be discharged; and if the balls are not electrified before the\r\ndischarge, neither will they appear to be so after the discharge, for they\r\nwill not repel each other.\r\n\r\nNow if the fire discharged from the inside surface of the bottle through\r\nits wire, remained on the prime conductor, the balls would be electrified\r\nand recede from each other.\r\n\r\nIf the phial really exploded at both ends, and discharged fire from both\r\ncoating and wire, the balls would be _more_ electrified and recede\r\n_farther_: for none of the fire can escape, the wax handle preventing.\r\n\r\nBut if the fire, with which the inside surface is surcharged, be so much\r\nprecisely as is wanted by the outside surface, it will pass round through\r\nthe wire fixed to the wax handle, restore the equilibrium in the glass, and\r\nmake no alteration in the state of the prime conductor.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we find, that if the prime conductor be electrified, and the\r\ncork balls in a state of repellency before the bottle is charged, they\r\ncontinue so afterwards. If not, they are not electrified by that discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRECTIONS _and_ ADDITIONS\r\n_to the_ PRECEDING PAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPage 2, Sect. 1. We since find, that the fire in the bottle is not\r\ncontained in the non-electric, but _in the glass_. All that is after said\r\nof the _top_ and _bottom_ of the bottle, is true of the _inside_ and\r\n_outside_ surfaces, and should have been so expressed. _See Sect._ 16, p.\r\n16.\r\n\r\nPage 6, Line 13. The equilibrium will soon be restored _but silently_, etc.\r\nThis must have been a mistake. When the bottle is full charged, the crooked\r\nwire cannot well be brought to touch the top and bottom so quick, but that\r\nthere will be a loud spark; unless the points be sharp, without loops.\r\n\r\nIbid. line ult. _Outside_: add, such moisture continuing up to the cork or\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nPage 12, line 14. _By candle-light_ etc. From some observations since made,\r\nI am inclined to think, that it is not the light, but the smoke or\r\nnon-electric effluvia from the candle, coal, and red-hot iron, that carry\r\noff the electrical fire, being first attracted and then repelled.\r\n\r\nPage 13, line 15.  _Windmil wheels_, &c. We afterwards discovered, that the\r\nafflux or efflux of the electrical fire, was not the cause of the motions\r\nof those wheels, but various circumstances of attraction and repulsion.\r\n\r\nPage 16, line 21. _Let_ A _and_ B _stand on wax_, &c.

Electricity is so much in vogue, that above one\r\n     hundred of them have been sold within these four months past.\r\n\r\n [3] To charge a bottle commodiously through the coating, place it on a\r\n     glass stand; form a communication from the prime conductor to the\r\n     coating, and another from the hook to the wall or floor. When it is\r\n     charged, remove the latter communication before you take hold of the\r\n     bottle, otherwise great part of the fire will escape by it.\r\n\r\n [4] The river that washes one side of _Philadelphia_, as the _Delaware_\r\n     does the other; both are ornamented with the summer habitations, of\r\n     the citizens, and the agreeable mansions of the principal people of\r\n     this colony.\r\n\r\n [5] An electrified bumper, is a small thin glass tumbler, near filled with\r\n     wine, and electrified as the bottle. This when brought to the lips\r\n     gives a shock, if the party be close shaved, and does not breathe on\r\n     the liquor.\r\n\r\n [6] Thunder-gusts are sudden storms of thunder and lightning, which are\r\n     frequently of short duration, but sometimes produce mischievous\r\n     effects.\r\n\r\n [7] See the ingenious essays on electricity in the Transactions, by Mr\r\n     Ellicot.\r\n\r\n [8] See the first sixteen Sections of my former Paper, called _Farther\r\n     Experiments_, &c.\r\n\r\n [9] See § 10 of _Farther Experiments_, &c.\r\n\r\n[10] In the dark the electrical fluid may be seen on the cushion in two\r\n     semi-circles or half-moons, one on the fore part, the other on the\r\n     back part of the cushion, just where the globe and cushion separate.\r\n     In the fore crescent the fire is passing out of the cushion into the\r\n     glass; in the other it is leaving the glass, and returning into the\r\n     back part of the cushion. When the prime conductor is apply'd to take\r\n     it off the glass, the back crescent disappears.\r\n\r\n[11] Gilt paper, with the gilt face next the glass, does well.\r\n\r\n[12] See farther experiments, § 15.",
