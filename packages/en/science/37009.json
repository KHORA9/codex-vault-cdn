Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this little book an attempt has been made to discuss the more\r\nabundant and widely distributed butterflies of eastern North America\r\nfrom the point of view of their life histories and their relations to\r\ntheir surroundings. In so doing I have of course availed myself of the\r\nwritten records of a host of students of butterflies, without whose\r\nlabors no such volume would be possible. Among these two names stand\r\nout preeminent--William H. Edwards and Samuel H. Scudder. Each was the\r\nauthor of a sumptuous work on American butterflies to which all later\r\nstudents must refer, both for information and for inspiration. Many\r\nothers, however, have made notable contributions to our literature of\r\nthese ethereal creatures. Every seeker after a knowledge of\r\nbutterflies will soon find himself indebted to the writings of such\r\ninvestigators as the Comstocks, Denton, Dickerson, Dyar, Fernald,\r\nFiske, Fletcher, French, Hancock, Holland, Howard, Longstaff, Newcomb,\r\nRiley, Skinner, Wright, and many others. I am glad to express my\r\nobligations to all of these for the assistance their records have\r\ngiven in the preparation of this book.\r\n\r\nWhile a vast amount of knowledge of butterflies has already been\r\ndiscovered there is still more to be learned concerning them, and\r\nthroughout these pages I have attempted to indicate the more important\r\nopportunities awaiting investigation. The day of the field naturalist\r\nhas come again and the butterflies are well worthy of careful\r\nobservations by many interested students.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations in the book require a word of credit. The eleven\r\ncolor plates of adult butterflies with wings spread have been made\r\ndirect from a set of the remarkable transfers which Mr. Sherman F.\r\nDenton has been preparing for the last quarter-century, this\r\nparticular set having been prepared especially for this book.\r\nTransfers of this sort were used as insets in Mr. Denton's work on the\r\n\"Moths and Butterflies of the United States,\" published in a limited\r\nedition by J. B. Millet Company, Boston. The other plates not\r\nreproduced from photographs are from drawings by Miss Mary E. Walker\r\nor Mr. W. I. Beecroft. In case the photographs are not of my own\r\ntaking, credit is given beneath each. Two of my photographs have\r\nalready appeared in \"Seeing Nature First\" and are here used by\r\npermission of its publishers, J. B. Lippincott Company.\r\n\r\n                                                            C. M.

They are primarily\r\nday fliers and are remarkable for the delicacy and beauty of their\r\nmembranous wings, covered with myriads of tiny scales that overlap one\r\nanother like the shingles on a house and show an infinite variety of\r\nhue through the coloring of the scales and their arrangement upon the\r\ntranslucent membrane running between the wing veins. It is this\r\ncharacteristic structure of the wings that gives to the great order of\r\nbutterflies and moths its name Lepidoptera, meaning scale-winged.\r\n\r\nIn the general structure of the body, the butterflies resemble other\r\ninsects. There are three chief divisions: head, thorax, and abdomen.\r\nThe head bears the principal sense organs; the thorax, the organs of\r\nlocomotion; and the abdomen, the organs of reproduction.\r\n\r\nBy examining a butterfly's head through a lens it is easy to see the\r\nprincipal appendages which it bears. Projecting forward from the\r\nmiddle of the top is a pair of long feelers or antennae. Each of these\r\nconsists of short joints which in general may be divided into three\r\ngroups: first, a few large joints at the base connecting the feeler\r\nwith the head; second, many rather small joints which make up the\r\nprincipal length; third, several larger joints which make up the outer\r\npart or \"club\" of the antennae. In the case of the Skippers, there are\r\nin addition a number of small joints coming to a sharp point at the\r\nend of the club. Just below the insertion of the antennae on each side\r\nof the head are the large compound eyes, which are almost\r\nhemispherical. With a powerful glass, one can see the honeycomb-like\r\nfacets, of which there are thousands, making up each eye. Just below\r\nthe eyes there are two hairy projections, called the palpi, between\r\nwhich is the coiled tongue or sucking tube. (_See plate, page 64-65._)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Butterfly Antennae, magnified. (From Holland)]\r\n\r\nAnatomically the thorax is divided into three parts--the prothorax,\r\nthe mesathorax, and the metathorax; but the lines of division between\r\nthese parts are not easily seen without denuding the skin of its hairy\r\ncovering. The prothorax bears the first pair of legs. The mesathorax\r\nbears the front pair of wings and the second pair of legs. The\r\nmetathorax bears the hind pair of wings and the third pair of legs. In\r\nmany butterflies, the first pair of legs are so reduced in size that\r\nthey are not used in walking.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen is composed of eight or nine distinct rings or segments,\r\nmost of which have two spiracles or breathing pores, one on each side.\r\nIt also bears upon the end of the body the ovipositor of the female\r\nor the clasping organs of the male.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLY TRANSFORMATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe butterflies furnish the best known examples of insect\r\ntransformations. The change from the egg to the caterpillar or larva,\r\nfrom the caterpillar to the pupa or chrysalis, and from the chrysalis\r\nto the butterfly or imago is doubtless the most generally known fact\r\nconcerning the life histories of insects. It is a typical example of\r\nwhat are called complete transformations as distinguished from the\r\nmanner of growth of grasshoppers, crickets, and many other insects in\r\nwhich the young that hatches from the egg bears a general resemblance\r\nto the adult and in which there is no quiet chrysalis stage when the\r\nlittle creature is unable to eat or to move about.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Egg of Baltimore Butterfly, much magnified.\r\n     (From Holland)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Growth of the Caterpillars_\r\n\r\nCaterpillars are like snakes in at least one respect: in order to\r\nprovide for their increase in size they shed their skins. When a\r\ncaterpillar hatches from the egg it is a tiny creature with a soft\r\nskin over most of its body but with rather a firm covering for its\r\nhead. While we might fancy that there could be a considerable increase\r\nin size provided for by the stretching of the soft skin it is easy to\r\nsee that the hard covering of the head will not admit of this. So the\r\nstory of the growth of a caterpillar may be told in this way:\r\n\r\nA butterfly lays an egg upon a leaf. Some days later the egg hatches\r\ninto a larva, which is the technical name for the second stage of an\r\ninsect's life. In the case of the butterfly we call this larva a\r\ncaterpillar. The little caterpillar is likely to take its first meal\r\nby eating the empty egg shell. This is a curious habit, and a really\r\nsatisfactory explanation of it seems not to have been made. Its next\r\nmeal is likely to be taken from the green tissues of the leaf,\r\ncommonly the green outer surface only being eaten at this time. The\r\nfuture meals are also taken from the leaf, more and more being eaten\r\nas the larva gets older.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of this feeding upon the leaf tissues the little\r\ncaterpillar becomes so crowded within the skin with which it was born\r\nthat it is necessary to have a larger one. So a new skin begins to\r\nform beneath the first one. Consequently the latter splits open in a\r\nstraight line part way down the middle of the back just behind the\r\nhead. Then the new head covering is withdrawn from the old one and the\r\ncaterpillar wriggles its way out of the split skin and finds itself\r\nclothed in a new one. At first all of the tissues of the new skin are\r\nsoft and pliable and they easily take on a larger size as the body of\r\nthe caterpillar expands. A little later these tissues become hardened\r\nand no further expansion is possible.\r\n\r\nThis process of skin-shedding is called moulting. The cast skin is\r\noften called the exuviae. The period of the caterpillar's life between\r\nthe hatching from the egg and this moult is often called a stage or\r\ninstar--that is, the caterpillar up to the time of this moult is\r\nliving in the first caterpillar stage or instar.\r\n\r\nDuring the actual moulting the caterpillar is quite active in freeing\r\nitself from the exuviae. But as soon as it is free it is likely to\r\nrest quietly for some hours while the tissues of the new skin are\r\nhardening. Then it begins feeding upon the leaf again and continues\r\ntaking its meals at more or less regular intervals for several days.\r\nBy that time it will again have reached its limit of growth within\r\nthis second skin and the process of moulting must be repeated. It\r\ntakes place in the same way as before and the caterpillar enters upon\r\nthe third instar of its larval life.\r\n\r\nThis process of feeding and moulting is continued for several weeks,\r\nthe number of moults being usually four. During the later stages the\r\nincrease in size is more marked each time the skin is shed, until the\r\ncaterpillar finally reaches its full growth as a larva and is ready\r\nfor the wonderful change to the quiet chrysalis in which all its\r\ncaterpillar organs are to be transformed into the very different\r\norgans of the butterfly.\r\n\r\nIn the case of butterfly larvae one of the most interesting features\r\nof the growth of the caterpillar is that of the remarkable changes in\r\ncolors and patterns of marking which the caterpillar undergoes. One\r\nwho had not followed these changes would often be at a loss to\r\nrecognize caterpillars of slightly differing sizes as belonging to the\r\nsame species. These changes commonly show a remarkable adaptation to\r\nthe conditions of life, and generally tend to the concealment of the\r\ncaterpillar upon its food plant. The stages of growth of the\r\ngreen-clouded swallowtail caterpillar are illustrated on plate\r\nopposite page 80.\r\n\r\nBefore each moult the caterpillar is likely to spin a silken web upon\r\nthe leaf surface. It then entangles its claws in the web to hold\r\nitself in place while the skin is cast. (_See plate, page 17._)\r\n\r\n\r\n _The Change to the Chrysalis_\r\n  (_See plate, pages 32-33._)\r\n\r\nA week or ten days after the last moult of its caterpillar growth the\r\nlarva commonly becomes full fed and ready to change to the chrysalis\r\nstate. The details of the way in which this is accomplished vary\r\ngreatly with different butterflies, as will be noted in the stories of\r\nmany species later in this book. In general, however, the caterpillar\r\nprovides a web of silk which it spins against some surface where the\r\nchrysalis will be secure and in this web it entangles its hind legs.\r\nSometimes there is the additional protection of a loop of silk over\r\nthe front end of the body. After the legs have become entangled the\r\ncaterpillar hangs downward until the skin splits open along the median\r\nline of the back and gradually shrinks upward until it is almost free,\r\nshowing as it comes off a curious creature which has some of the\r\ncharacteristic features of a chrysalis. It is seldom at this stage of\r\nthe same shape as the chrysalis. When the caterpillar's skin is nearly\r\noff this chrysalis-like object usually wriggles its body quickly in a\r\nmanner to entangle a curious set of hooks attached to the upper end in\r\nthe web of silken thread. This hook-like projection is called the\r\ncremaster, and it serves a very important purpose in holding the\r\nchrysalis in position.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Swallowtail Chrysalis, showing (_b_) the loop of\r\n     silk over thorax. (After Riley)]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cremaster is entangled in the web the cast skin usually\r\nfalls off and for a very short period the creature hanging seems to be\r\nneither caterpillar nor chrysalis. It is in fact in a transition stage\r\nbetween the two, and it very soon shortens up and takes on the\r\ndefinite form of the chrysalis, the outer tissues hardening into the\r\ncharacteristic chrysalis skin.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that this chrysalis skin shows many of the\r\ncharacteristic features of the future butterfly it is evident that the\r\nchange from the caterpillar to the butterfly really began during the\r\nlife of the larva. The nature of the process by which this change\r\ntakes place has long been a puzzle to scientists. For the making of a\r\nbutterfly is one of the most wonderful phenomena in the outer world,\r\nand it has challenged the attention of many acute observers. Some two\r\ncenturies ago the great Dutch naturalist, Swammerdam, studied very\r\ncarefully the development of many insects, especially the butterfly.\r\nHe found that if he placed in boiling water a caterpillar that was\r\nready to pupate or become a chrysalis, the outer skin could easily be\r\nremoved, revealing beneath the immature butterfly with well-developed\r\nlegs and antennae. From these observations he was led to believe that\r\nthe process of growth was simply a process of unfolding; that is, as\r\nProfessor Packard has expressed it, \"That the form of the larva, pupa,\r\nand imago preexisted in the egg and even in the ovary; and that the\r\ninsects in these stages were distinct animals, contained one inside\r\nthe other, like a nest of boxes or a series of envelopes one within\r\nthe other.\" This was called the incasement theory and it was held to\r\nbe correct by naturalists for nearly a century. It was discredited,\r\nhowever, about a hundred years ago, but not until another fifty years\r\nhad passed was it definitely replaced by another and much more\r\nconvincing theory propounded by Weismann.\r\n\r\nAccording to Weismann's theory, which is now well-established, the\r\nprocess of development internally is a much more continuous one than\r\nthe external changes would indicate. So far as the latter are\r\nconcerned we simply say that a caterpillar changes to a chrysalis and\r\na chrysalis to a butterfly, the transition in each case requiring but\r\na very short time. Internally, however, it has been going on almost\r\ncontinuously from the early life of the caterpillar. The various\r\norgans of the butterfly arise from certain germinal disks or\r\n\"imaginal\" buds, the word \"imaginal\" in this case being an adjective\r\nform of imago, so that the imaginal buds are really simply buds for\r\nthe starting of growth of the various organs of the imago or adult. As\r\nthe caterpillars approach the chrysalis period these imaginal buds\r\nrapidly develop into the various organs of the butterfly. This process\r\nis helped along by the breaking down of many of the tissues of the\r\nlarva, this broken-down tissue being then utilized for the production\r\nof the new organs. About the time the chrysalis is formed this\r\nbreaking-down process becomes very general, so that the newly formed\r\nchrysalis seems largely a mass of creamy material which is soon used\r\nto build up the various parts of the butterfly through the growth of\r\nthe imaginal buds.\r\n\r\n\r\n _The Change to the Butterfly_\r\n  (_See plate, pages 32-33._)\r\n\r\nThere is probably no phenomenon in the world of living creatures which\r\nhas attracted more attention than the change of the chrysalis into the\r\nbutterfly. It is not strange that this is so. We see upon a tree or\r\nshrub or wall an inert, apparently lifeless object, having no\r\ndefinite form with which we can compare it with other things, having\r\nneither eyes nor ears nor wings nor legs--an object apparently of as\r\nlittle interest as a lifeless piece of rock. A few minutes later we\r\nbehold it again and note with astonishment that this apparently\r\ninanimate being has been suddenly transformed into the most ethereal\r\nof the creatures of earth, with an exquisite beauty that cannot fail\r\nto attract admiration, with wings of most delicate structure for\r\nflying through the air, with eyes of a thousand facets, with organs of\r\nsmell that baffle the ingenuity of man to explain, with vibrant\r\nantennae, and a slender tongue adapted to feeding upon the nectar of\r\nflowers--the most ambrosial of natural food. So it is not strange that\r\nthis emergence of a butterfly has long been the theme both of poets\r\nand theologians and that it attracts the admiring attention of\r\nchildhood, youth, and age.\r\n\r\nFortunately, this change from chrysalis to butterfly may readily be\r\nobserved by any one who will take a little trouble to rear the\r\ncaterpillars or to watch chrysalids found outdoors. The precise method\r\nof eclosion, as we call this new kind of \"hatching,\" varies somewhat\r\nwith different species but in general the process is similar in all.\r\n\r\nThose chrysalids which have a light colored outer skin are especially\r\ndesirable if we would watch this process. One can see through the\r\nsemi-transparent membrane the developing butterfly within, until\r\nfinally, just before it is ready to break out, the markings of the\r\nwings and body show distinctly. If at this time the chrysalis is\r\nplaced in the sunshine it is likely to come out at once, so that you\r\ncan observe it readily. It usually breaks apart over the head and the\r\nnewly released legs quickly grasp hold of the empty skin as well as of\r\nthe support to which it is attached. It then hangs downward with a\r\nvery large abdomen and with the wings more or less crumpled up, but\r\ndecidedly larger than when they were confined within the chrysalis.\r\nThe wings, however, soon begin to lengthen as they are stretched out,\r\nprobably through the filling of the space by the body juices.\r\nCommonly, the hind pair of wings become full size before the front\r\nones. In a short time the wings attain their full size, the abdomen\r\nbecomes smaller, through the discharge of a liquid called meconium,\r\nand the butterfly is likely to walk a few steps to a better position\r\nwhere it will rest quietly for an hour or two while body and wing\r\ntissues harden. After this it is likely to fly away to lead the free\r\nlife of a butterfly. (_See plate, page 16._)\r\n\r\nThese changes from larva to chrysalis and from chrysalis to adult in\r\nthe case of the Monarch Butterfly are illustrated on the plates\r\nopposite pages 32-33. A little study of these photographs from life\r\nwill help greatly to an understanding of the process.\r\n\r\nSome very interesting observations have been made by Mr. J. Alston\r\nMoffat upon the method of the expansion of the wings. In summarizing\r\nhis investigations he writes:\r\n\r\n\"When a wing is fully expanded, and for an hour or two after, the\r\nmembranes can be easily separated. Entrance for a pin-point between\r\nthem is to be found at the base of the wing where the subcostal and\r\nmedian nervures come close together. The membranes are united at the\r\ncostal and inner edges, which have to be cut to get them apart; but\r\nthey are free at the outer angle. At that time the nervures are in two\r\nparts, half in one membrane and half in the other, and open in the\r\ncentre. The fluid which has been stored up in the pupa enters the\r\nwinglet at the opening referred to, expanding the membranes as it\r\npasses along between them, and the nervures at the same time, and when\r\nit has extended to every portion of the wing, then it is fully\r\nexpanded. The expanding fluid is of a gummy consistency, and as it\r\ndries, cements the membranes together, also the edges of the\r\nhalf-nervures, and produces the hollow tubes with which we are so\r\nfamiliar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLIES AND MOTHS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe butterflies and moths both belong to the great order of\r\nscale-winged insects--the Lepidoptera. They are distinguished,\r\nhowever, by certain general characteristics, which hold true for the\r\nmost part in both groups. The butterflies fly by day; the moths fly by\r\nnight. All of the higher butterflies go into the chrysalis state\r\nwithout making a silken cocoon, while most of the higher moths make\r\nsuch a cocoon. The bodies of the butterflies are usually slender,\r\nwhile those of the larger moths are stout. The antennae of the\r\nbutterflies are generally slender and commonly enlarged at the tip\r\ninto a miniature club. The antennae of the larger moths are commonly\r\nfeathery or are long and slender, tapering gradually toward the tip.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Butterfly wing scales, magnified.\r\n     (From Holland)]\r\n\r\nThe characteristic features that distinguish a moth from a butterfly\r\nare well illustrated in the plate opposite page 49, which shows one of\r\nthe largest and most beautiful moths in the world. It is the Cynthia\r\nmoth. As may be seen, the newly emerged moth is resting upon the\r\nsilken cocoon in which it spent its period as a pupa or chrysalis.\r\nThis cocoon was attached by the caterpillar to the twig from which it\r\nhangs at the time it spun the cocoon. The feathered antennae, the\r\nhairy legs, the thick thorax, and large abdomen--all show very clearly\r\nin this side view of the moth. As will be seen, the wings are large\r\nand very suggestive of those of a butterfly and have the\r\ncharacteristic eye-spots toward the tip and the crescent marks in the\r\nmiddle, which are so often found on the wings of the larger moths.\r\n\r\nSome of these large moths on cloudy days occasionally fly during\r\ndaylight and, by the uninitiated, they are often mistaken for large\r\nbutterflies. One who will notice their structure, however, will\r\nreadily see the characteristic features of the moth.\r\n\r\nIn the caterpillar stage, there are no hard and fast differences\r\nbetween the larvae of butterflies and those of the higher moths. In\r\neach case, the insect consists of a worm-like body, having a small\r\nhead provided with biting jaws and simple eyes or ocelli. Back of the\r\nhead are the three rings of the thorax, each of which bears a pair of\r\njointed legs. Back of these three rings there are a considerable\r\nnumber of other body rings making up the abdomen, on the middle of\r\nwhich there are commonly four or five pairs of fleshy prolegs, not\r\njointed but furnished at the tip with fine claws. At the hind end of\r\nthe body there is another pair of prolegs similar in structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCENTS OF BUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nMany students of American butterflies have occasionally mentioned the\r\nfact that certain species seem to give off a distinct scent which has\r\nfrequently been spoken of as a pleasing fragrance, suggesting\r\nsandalwood or some other aromatic odor. The general subject as\r\nexemplified by butterflies of other lands has been studied for many\r\nyears by Fritz Mueller; and certain English entomologists have paid\r\nconsiderable attention to it. A translation of the Mueller publications\r\nand an excellent summary of our present knowledge of the subject is\r\npublished in Dr. Longstaff's book on butterfly hunting.\r\n\r\nThe odors given off by butterflies are divided into two principal\r\nkinds, namely: first, those which are repulsive to the senses of man,\r\nand evidently for the purpose of protecting the butterflies from birds\r\nand other vertebrate enemies--these are found in both sexes; second,\r\nthose which are evidently for the purpose of sexual attraction and\r\nconfined to the male butterflies--these scents are usually attractive\r\nto the senses of man.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Androconia from wings of male butterflies]\r\n\r\nThe aromatic scents of the second group are generally produced by\r\nmeans of certain scales or hairs of many curious forms, which are\r\nscattered over the surface of the wings or are placed within certain\r\nspecial pockets, generally near the borders of the wings. These scales\r\nor hairs are called androconia. Some of them much magnified are\r\nrepresented in the picture above.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the scents given off by American butterflies is very\r\nfragmentary, and it is highly desirable that many more observations\r\nshould be made upon the subject. If collectors generally would make\r\ncareful notes, both in the field and upon the freshly killed\r\nbutterflies at home, we ought soon to be able greatly to extend our\r\nknowledge. By holding the butterfly with a pair of forceps, one can\r\noften determine whether the fragrance is emitted. It is often helpful\r\nalso to brush the hairs or tufts where the androconia are attached,\r\nusing a small, dry camel's hair brush for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLY MIGRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nMigration seems to be a general instinct in the animal world,\r\ndeveloped when a species becomes enormously abundant. At such times\r\nthis instinct apparently overcomes all others and the creatures move\r\non regardless of obstacles and conditions that may mean certain death\r\nto the vast majority. Such migrations among mammals have often been\r\nrecorded, one of the most notable examples being that of the little\r\nlemmings which migrate at periodical intervals in a way which has\r\noften been described. Among the insects such migrations have been\r\nfrequently noticed, and the phenomenon has apparently been observed\r\noftener among the butterflies than in any other group. Entomological\r\nliterature during the last hundred years contains a great many records\r\nof enormous flights of butterflies over long distances, extending even\r\nfrom Africa into Europe or from one part of America to another far\r\nremote. As such migration is likely to happen whenever a species\r\nbecomes extremely abundant it probably is Nature's way of providing\r\nfor an extended food supply for the succeeding generations. That it\r\nresults in the death of the great majority of the migrants is\r\ndoubtless true, but it must lead to vast experiments in extending the\r\ngeographic area inhabited by these species. Numerous examples of such\r\nmigrating swarms will be found in the pages of this little book. (_See\r\nplates, pages 17,48-49, 160._)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _Photographed from life by A. H. Verrill_\r\n                                                       _See page 12_\r\n\r\n     SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY JUST OUT OF ITS CHRYSALIS.\r\n       THE CHRYSALIS SKIN BELOW]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:                                      _See page 72_\r\n\r\n     TIGER SWALLOWTAIL]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _Photographed from life_              _See page 7_\r\n\r\n     THE HAMMOCK CATERPILLAR ON ITS HAMMOCK]\r\n\r\nThe migrations thus considered are only exceptional occurrences. There\r\nis, however, a regularly recurring annual migration on the part of\r\nsome butterflies which is also a phenomenon of extraordinary interest.\r\nThe most notable example is that of the Monarch which apparently\r\nfollows the birds southward every autumn and comes northward again in\r\nspring. There is much evidence to indicate that in some slight degree\r\nother butterflies have a similar habit, although the present\r\nobservations are inadequate to determine to what extent this habit has\r\nbecome fixed in most of these species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIBERNATION OR WINTER LETHARGY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ways in which butterflies spend the winter are always of peculiar\r\ninterest to the naturalist. Here are creatures with four distinct\r\nstages of existence, each of which has the possibility of carrying the\r\nspecies through the season of cold. It is necessary to learn for each\r\ninsect which stage has been chosen for the purpose, and if possible to\r\nfind the reasons for the choice.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the related members of a group are likely to hibernate in a\r\nsimilar stage. Thus most of the Swallowtails pass the winter as\r\nchrysalids while practically all the Angle-wings pass the winter as\r\nadults. This rule, however, has many exceptions, for one will often\r\nfind closely related species which differ in the stage of hibernation.\r\n\r\nAs one would expect, the conditions of hibernation vary greatly with\r\nthe latitude. In the severe climate of the far north the conditions\r\nare likely to be more uniform than in the South where the milder\r\nclimate permits greater variation to the insect. In some cases where a\r\nbutterfly hibernates in only one stage in Canada it may pass the\r\nwinter in two or more stages in Alabama or Florida.\r\n\r\nIn many other orders of insects the egg is a favorite stage for\r\nhibernation. Even in the closely related moths it is often chosen by\r\nmany species, but comparatively few butterflies pass the winter in the\r\negg stage. The little Bronze Copper may serve as one example of this\r\nlimited group.\r\n\r\nThe conditions as to hibernation by the larvae of butterflies are very\r\ndifferent from those of the egg. It has been estimated that probably\r\nhalf of all our species pass the winter in some stage of caterpillar\r\ngrowth. This varies all the way from the newly hatched caterpillar\r\nwhich hibernates without tasting food to the fully grown caterpillar\r\nwhich hibernates full fed and changes to a chrysalis in spring without\r\neating anything at that time. A large proportion, however, feed both\r\nin fall and spring, going through the winter when approximately half\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nThe Graylings and the Fritillaries are typical examples of butterflies\r\nwhich hibernate as newly hatched larvae. The eggs are laid in autumn\r\nupon or near the food plants and the caterpillars gnaw their way out\r\nof the shells and seek seclusion at once, finding such shelter as they\r\nmay in the materials on the soil surface. In spring they begin to feed\r\nas soon as the weather permits and complete their growth from then\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe half-grown caterpillars may hibernate either as free creatures\r\nunder boards, stones, or in the turfy grass, or they may be protected\r\nby special shelters which they have provided for themselves in their\r\nearlier life. In the case of the latter each may have a shelter of its\r\nown or there may be a common shelter for a colony of caterpillars.\r\nAmong the examples of those hibernating in miscellaneous situations\r\nwithout special protection the caterpillars of the Tawny Emperor, the\r\nGray Emperor, the Pearl Crescent, and some of the Graylings are\r\nexamples. Among those which hibernate in individual shelters the\r\nSovereigns, among which our common Viceroy is most familiar, are good\r\nexamples. Among those which hibernate in a tent woven by the whole\r\ncolony for the whole colony the Baltimore or Phaeton butterfly is\r\nperhaps the best example.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars that hibernate when full grown may be grouped in a\r\nway somewhat similar to those which are half grown. Many species\r\nsimply find such shelter as they may at or near the soil surface. The\r\nClouded Sulphur is a good example of these. Others pass the winter in\r\nindividual shelters made from a leaf or blade. Several of the larger\r\nSkippers are good examples of this condition. So far as I know none of\r\nour species pass the winter in colonial shelters when full grown.\r\n\r\nIt would be natural to suppose that the great majority of butterflies\r\nwould be likely to hibernate in the chrysalis state. Here is a quiet\r\nstage in which the insect is unable to move about or to take any food,\r\nin which it seems entirely dormant and as a rule is fairly well hidden\r\nfrom the view of enemies. We find, however, that only a rather small\r\nproportion of our butterflies has chosen this stage for survival\r\nthrough the winter. The most conspicuous examples are the\r\nSwallowtails, nearly all of which hibernate in the chrysalis stage.\r\nOther examples are the various Whites, the Orange-tips, and isolated\r\nspecies like the Wanderer, and the Spring Azure and the American\r\nCopper. Practically all the butterflies that pass the winter as\r\nchrysalids have a silken loop running around near the middle of the\r\nbody which helps to hold them securely through the long winter months.\r\nApparently none of those chrysalids which hang straight downward are\r\nable to survive the winter.\r\n\r\nAn adult butterfly seems a fragile creature to endure the long cold\r\nmonths of arctic regions. Yet many of our most beautiful species\r\nhabitually hibernate as adults, finding shelter in such situations as\r\nhollow trees, the crevices in rocks, the openings beneath loose bark\r\nor even the outer bark on the under side of a large branch. It is\r\nsignificant that most of the adult-wintering Angle-wings are northern\r\nrather than southern species, some of them being found in arctic\r\nregions practically around the world. One of the few southern forms\r\nthat hibernates as an adult is the Goatweed Emperor.\r\n\r\nThese examples are all cases of true hibernation in a lethargic\r\ncondition. There are certain butterflies, however, which pass the\r\nwinter as adults that remain active during this period. Obviously this\r\nis impossible in latitudes where the winter is severe, and it involves\r\nmigration to a warmer climate. The one notable illustration of this is\r\nthe Monarch butterfly which apparently flies southward to the Gulf\r\nstates at least and there remains until spring, when individuals come\r\nnorth again. The southward migration may be begun in Canada when the\r\nbutterflies gather together in enormous flocks that remind one of the\r\ngathering of the clans with the migrating birds. This is one of the\r\nleast understood of insect activities but it has been observed so\r\noften and over so long a period of years that there seems to be no\r\nquestioning the general habit.\r\n\r\nLike everything else in relation to living things there are numerous\r\nvariations in the prevailing modes of hibernation. In the case of many\r\nspecies one can find combinations of two or more stages in which the\r\nwinter is passed. Probably if we could observe with sufficient care we\r\nmight be able to find somewhere examples of almost any conceivable\r\ndouble combination--as egg with larva or chrysalis or adult--the\r\ninsect hibernating in two of these stages. Many examples are known in\r\nwhich both chrysalis and adult of the same species pass the winter and\r\nalso of those in which young and well-grown larvae pass the winter. As\r\none would expect, the conditions as to such combinations are likely to\r\nbe more variable in southern than in northern regions.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the attention which has been paid to butterfly\r\nlife-histories there is still some uncertainty in regard to the\r\nhibernation of many of our species. One of the most interesting series\r\nof observations which a young naturalist could undertake would be to\r\nlearn positively how each species of butterfly in his locality passes\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAESTIVATION OR SUMMER LETHARGY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some species of butterflies there is a special adaptation to\r\npassing through the hottest part of the summer season in a state of\r\nlethargy which is suggestive of the torpor of the hibernating period.\r\nThis phase of butterfly existence has not been extensively studied and\r\nthere are indications that it exists more generally than has been\r\ncommonly supposed. It has been noticed even in northern New England\r\nthat some of the Angle-wings seek shelter and become lethargic during\r\nAugust. Apparently this is an adaptation to single broodedness,\r\nhelping to carry the species through the year without the exhaustion\r\nincident to the continued activity of the butterfly.\r\n\r\nIn more southern regions, especially in the hot, dry climates where\r\nvegetation withers in midsummer, it is well known that some\r\ncaterpillars become lethargic, remaining inactive until the fall rains\r\nstart vegetation into growth. The Orange-sulphur butterfly is a good\r\nexample of this.\r\n\r\nThis summer lethargy offers excellent opportunity for careful study.\r\nAny observer who finds a butterfly hidden away in summer under boards,\r\nthe bark of a tree, or in a stone pile should look carefully to see\r\nwhat species it is and how the butterfly behaves. Such observations\r\nshould be sent to the entomological journals in order that our\r\nknowledge of the subject may be increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEIGNING DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact has long been noticed that various butterflies have the habit\r\nat times of feigning death and dropping to the ground where they may\r\nlie motionless for a considerable period. This habit is most easily\r\nobserved in some of the Angle-wings, especially those which hibernate\r\nas adults. Those species have the under surfaces of their wings\r\ncolored in various bark-picturing patterns and apparently live\r\nthrough the winter to some extent, resting beneath the bark of large\r\nbranches or upon the trunks of trees. Many of them also secrete\r\nthemselves in hollow trees or beneath loose bark or in board piles or\r\nstone walls. It is probable, however, that during the long ages when\r\nthese insects were adapting themselves to their life conditions,\r\nbefore man interfered with the natural order and furnished various\r\nmore or less artificial places for hibernation, these butterflies\r\nrested more generally upon the under side of branches than they do\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nEven in warm weather when one of these butterflies is suddenly\r\ndisturbed it is likely to fold its legs upon its body and drop to the\r\nground, allowing itself to be handled without showing any signs of\r\nlife. This habit is doubtless of value, especially during hibernation\r\nor possibly during the summer lethargy or aestivation, the latter a\r\nhabit which may be more general among these butterflies than is now\r\nsupposed. As the insect lies motionless upon the ground it is very\r\nlikely to blend so thoroughly with its surroundings that it becomes\r\nconcealed, and any bird which had startled it from the branch above\r\nwould have difficulty in finding it.\r\n\r\nSome very interesting observations have been made upon the\r\ndeath-feigning instincts of various other insects, especially the\r\nbeetles. But no one so far as I know has yet made an extended study of\r\nthe subject in relation to our American butterflies. It is an\r\nexcellent field for investigation and offers unusual opportunities for\r\nphotographic records. One of the pictures opposite page 32 shows a\r\nphotograph which I took of a Mourning Cloak as it was thus playing\r\n'possum. This species exhibits the instinct to a marked degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of butterflies and moths form a large part of the\r\nfood of insect-eating birds. These caterpillars are especially adapted\r\nfor such a purpose and in the economy of nature they play a very\r\nimportant part in keeping alive the feathered tribes. During the long\r\nages through which both birds and insects have been developing side by\r\nside, there have been many remarkable inter-relations established\r\nwhich tend on the one hand to prevent the birds from exterminating the\r\ninsects and on the other to prevent the insects from causing the birds\r\nto starve. The most important of these, so far as the caterpillars are\r\nconcerned, are the various devices by which these insects protect\r\nthemselves from attack, by hiding away where birds are not likely to\r\nfind them, by clothing their bodies with spiny hairs, by other methods\r\nof rendering themselves distasteful, or by various phases of\r\nconcealing coloration. On the whole, the examples of the latter are\r\nnot so numerous or so easily found in the case of the larvae of\r\nbutterflies as in those of moths.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the basal principle of concealing coloration is the law of\r\ncounter-shading, first partially announced by Prof. E. B. Poulton, and\r\nlater much more elaborately worked out by Mr. Abbott H. Thayer, and\r\ndiscussed at length by Mr. Gerald H. Thayer in his remarkable volume,\r\n\"Concealing Coloration in the Animal Kingdom.\" The law of\r\ncounter-shading is tersely stated in these words: \"Animals are painted\r\nby nature darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the\r\nsky's light and _vice versa_.\" As this law works out on most animals\r\nthat live on or near the ground, the upper part of the body exposed\r\nto the direct light from above is dark; and the under part, shut off\r\nfrom the upper light and receiving only the small reflection from\r\nbelow, is enough lighter to make the appearance of the creature in its\r\nnatural environment of a uniform tone from back to breast.\r\n\r\nNearly all caterpillars illustrate this law of counter-shading. If\r\nthey are in the habit of feeding or resting with their feet downward\r\nthe back will be darker and the under side lighter, but if they are in\r\nthe habit of feeding or resting in the opposite position these color\r\ntones will be reversed. One can find examples of such conditions\r\nalmost any summer's day by a little searching of trees or shrubs.\r\n\r\nThis law of counter-shading, however, is really only the basis for the\r\ncoloration of caterpillars or other animals. It tends, chiefly, to\r\nmake the creature appear as a flat plane when seen from the side, and\r\nmay be said in a way to prepare the canvas upon which Nature paints\r\nher more distinctive pictures. A great many examples of color markings\r\nthat tend to conceal the caterpillar amid its natural surroundings may\r\nbe found by any one who will study the subject and it offers one of\r\nthe most interesting fields for investigation. The chapter on\r\ncaterpillars in the above-mentioned book by Mr. Thayer should serve as\r\na starting point for any one taking up the subject.\r\n\r\nButterflies differ from caterpillars and from most other animals in\r\nthe fact that their coloring is chiefly shown upon the flat surfaces\r\nof the wings. Consequently, there is less opportunity for the various\r\nphases of counter-shading which is so commonly shown in the larger\r\ncaterpillars. The bodies of nearly all butterflies do exhibit this\r\nphenomenon, but these bodies are relatively so small that\r\ncounter-shading plays but a little part in the general display.\r\n\r\nUpon the outstretched membranes of the butterflies' wings Nature\r\nthrough the long ages of development has painted a great variety of\r\npictures. Those which tend to protect the insect by concealment amid\r\nits surroundings are most commonly spread on the under surface of the\r\nwings. Especially is this true in the case of those species which pass\r\nthe winter as adults or which have the habit of resting upon the bark\r\nof trees, the sides of rocks, or the surface of the ground. We here\r\nfind some of the most interesting examples of obliterative coloring\r\nthat occur in nature. Some butterflies have taken on the look of tree\r\nbark, others the sombre appearance of weathered rocks, while still\r\nothers are painted with the images of flowerets and their stems.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dazzling and Eclipsing Colors_\r\n\r\nMany of the butterflies, especially the Angle-wings, which are marked\r\non the under surface in various protective colors, are admirable\r\nexamples of that phase of animal coloring which is spoken of as\r\n_dazzling coloration_. This is apparently one of the most important\r\nprotective devices to be found in Nature and the validity of it is now\r\ngenerally conceded by naturalists. One phase of it, which may be\r\ncalled eclipsing coloration, seems to have been first definitely\r\nformulated by the late Lord Walsingham, a famous English entomologist\r\nwho enunciated it in an address as president of the Entomological\r\nSociety of London. The most significant paragraphs in that address\r\nwere these:\r\n\r\n\"My attention was lately drawn to a passage in Herbert Spencer's\r\n'Essay on the Morals of Trade.' He writes: 'As when tasting different\r\nfoods or wines the palate is disabled by something strongly flavored\r\nfrom appreciating the more delicate flavor of another thing afterward\r\ntaken, so with the other organs of sense a temporary disability\r\nfollows an excessive stimulation. This holds not only with the eyes in\r\njudging of colors, but also with the fingers in judging of texture.'\r\n\r\n\"Here, I think, we have an explanation of the principle on which\r\nprotection is undoubtedly afforded to certain insects by the\r\npossession of bright coloring on such parts of their wings or bodies\r\nas can be instantly covered and concealed at will. It is an undoubted\r\nfact, and one which must have been observed by nearly all collectors\r\nof insects abroad, and perhaps also in our own country, that it is\r\nmore easy to follow with the eye the rapid movements of a more\r\nconspicuous insect soberly and uniformly colored than those of an\r\ninsect capable of changing in an instant the appearance it presents.\r\nThe eye, having once fixed itself upon an object of a certain form and\r\ncolor, conveys to the mind a corresponding impression, and, if that\r\nimpression is suddenly found to be unreliable, the instruction which\r\nthe mind conveys to the eye becomes also unreliable, and the rapidity\r\nwith which the impression and consequent instruction can be changed\r\ncannot always compete successfully with the rapid transformation\r\neffected by the insect in its effort to escape.\"\r\n\r\nLord Walsingham then goes on to suggest that this intermittent play of\r\nbright colors probably has as confusing effect upon birds and other\r\npredaceous vertebrates as upon man; and that on this hypothesis such\r\ncolors can be accounted for more satisfactorily than upon any other\r\nyet suggested. Since then the significance of this theory has been\r\nrepeatedly pointed out by Professor Poulton, Mr. Abbott H. Thayer, and\r\nvarious other authorities upon animal coloring. The terms _dazzling_\r\nand _eclipsing_ have been applied to the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nShortly after Lord Walsingham propounded this theory I called\r\nattention [A] to its fitness in explaining some of the most interesting\r\ncolor phases shown by American insects, notably the moths and locusts\r\nwhich have brilliantly colored under wings and protectively colored\r\nupper wings.\r\n\r\n   [A] _Popular Science Monthly_, 1898, \"A Game of Hide and Seek.\"\r\n       Reprinted in the _Insect World_, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe animals of the north show numberless color phases of interest. One\r\nof the most curious of these is exhibited by several families of\r\ninsects in which the outer wings are protectively colored in dull hues\r\nand the under wings brightly colored. For example, there are many\r\nspecies of moths belonging to the genus Catocala found throughout the\r\nUnited States. These are insects of good size, the larger ones\r\nmeasuring three inches in expanse of wings, and the majority of them\r\nbeing at least two thirds that size. Most of them live during the day\r\non the bark of trees, with their front wings folded together over the\r\nback. The colors and markings of these wings, as well as of the rest\r\nof the exposed portions of the body, are such as to assimilate closely\r\nwith the bark of the tree upon which the insect rests. In such a\r\nsituation it requires a sharp eye to detect the presence of the moth,\r\nwhich, unless disturbed, flies only at night, remaining all day\r\nexposed to the attacks of many enemies. Probably the most important of\r\nthese are the birds, especially species like the woodpeckers, which\r\nare constantly exploring all portions of the trunks of trees.\r\n\r\nThe chief beauty of these Catocalas, as they are seen spread out in\r\nthe museum cabinet, lies in the fact that the hind wings, which, when\r\nthe moth is at rest in life, are concealed by the front ones, are\r\nbrightly colored in contrasting hues of black, red, and white in\r\nvarious brilliant combinations. These colors, in connection with the\r\nsoft and blended tones of the front wings, make a very handsome\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that when one of these Underwing Moths is driven to\r\nflight by a woodpecker or other bark-searching bird it would show\r\nduring its rapid, irregular flight the bright colors of the under\r\nwings which would be instantly hidden upon alighting and the very\r\ndifferent coloring of the upper wings blending with the bark would be\r\nsubstituted. Consequently, the bird would be very likely to be baffled\r\nin its pursuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coloration of Locusts_\r\n\r\nOn the rocky hills and sandy plains of New England there are several\r\nspecies of grasshoppers or locusts that also illustrate these\r\nprinciples. If you walk along a strip of sandy land in summer, you\r\nstart to flight certain locusts which soon alight, and when searched\r\nfor will be found closely to assimilate in color the sand upon which\r\nthey rest. On a neighboring granite-ribbed hill you will find few if\r\nany of this species of locust, but instead there occur two or three\r\nquite different species, which when at rest closely resemble the\r\nlichen-covered rocks. This resemblance is very striking, and is found\r\nin all stages of the insect's existence. If now you go to a lowland\r\nmeadow, still another color phase will be found to prevail--the green\r\ngrass is swarming with the so-called \"long-horned\" grasshoppers,\r\nwhich are green throughout with linear bodies, and long, slender legs\r\nand antennae.\r\n\r\nEach of these three groups of insects is adapted to its particular\r\nhabitat. All are constantly persecuted by birds, and have been so\r\npersecuted for unnumbered ages in the past. In every generation the\r\nindividuals have varied, some toward closer resemblance to\r\nenvironment, others in an opposite direction. The more conspicuous\r\ninsects have been constantly taken, and the least conspicuous as\r\nconstantly left to reproduce. Were the three groups to change places\r\nto-day, the green grasshoppers from the meadows going to sandy\r\nsurfaces, the sand-colored locusts going to rocky hills, and the\r\n\"mossbacks\" from the hills to the lowland meadows, each would become\r\nconspicuous, and the birds would have such a feast as is seldom spread\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nThe species living on sand and rocks are often \"flushed\" by birds.\r\nThose which flew but a few feet would be likely to be captured by the\r\npursuing bird; those which flew farther would stand a better chance of\r\nescaping. Similarly, those which flew slowly and in a straight line\r\nwould be more likely to be caught than those which flew rapidly and\r\ntook a zigzag course. As a consequence of the selection thus brought\r\nabout through the elimination of those which flew slowly along the\r\nstraight and narrow way that led to death, you will find that most\r\nlocusts living in exposed situations when startled fly some distance\r\nin a rapid, zigzag manner.\r\n\r\nBut still another element of safety has been introduced by some\r\nspecies of these locusts through the adoption of the color tactics of\r\nthe Catocala moths. The under wings of the common Carolina locust--the\r\nspecies most abundant along the highway--are black, bordered with\r\nyellowish white. The base of the hind wings of a related species\r\nliving on the Western plains is bluish, while in the large\r\ncoral-winged locust of the Eastern states the hind wings are red,\r\nbordered with black. In nearly all of the species of these locusts\r\nfrequenting open localities where they are liable to disturbance by\r\nbirds or other animals, the hind wings exhibit contrasting colors in\r\nflight. Most of them also fly in a zigzag line, and alight in a most\r\nerratic manner. Many times I have had difficulty in determining the\r\nexact landfall of one of these peculiar creatures, and I believe Lord\r\nWalsingham's suggestion is well exemplified in them. (_See page 33._)\r\n\r\nThe most famous example of a combination of this dazzling coloring of\r\nthe upper wing surface with a definite protective coloring of the\r\nunder wing surface is the Kallima butterfly which is illustrated in\r\nalmost every book dealing with animal coloration. The under wing\r\nsurface bears a striking resemblance to a leaf and the hind wings\r\nproject to form a tail which looks like the petiole of the leaf, and\r\nthere is also a mark running across the wings which mimics the midrib.\r\nWhen the butterfly is flying the brilliant colors of the upper surface\r\nare visible, but when it alights these are instantly replaced by the\r\nsombre tone of the under surface, so that apparently the insect\r\ncompletely disappears and in its place there is only a leaf attached\r\nto a branch in a most natural position. In Dr. Longstaff's book there\r\nis an illustration of another tropical butterfly, _Eronia cleodora_,\r\nwhich resembles on its under surface a yellow disease-stricken leaf\r\nbut on its upper surface gives a brilliant combination of black and\r\nwhite. This insect alights upon the leaves which it resembles and is\r\na striking example of both dazzling and mimicking coloration.\r\n\r\nMany of our own butterflies, notably the Angle-wings, are excellent\r\nexamples of a similar combination. In flight they reveal conspicuous\r\ncolors which are instantly hidden upon alighting and then one only\r\nsees the bark-like or dead leaf-like under surface as may be seen in\r\nthe plate opposite pages 160-161. The iridescence upon the upper wing\r\nsurface of many butterflies, whose under wing surface is colored in\r\nconcealing tones, is doubtless also of great use to the insect in a\r\nsimilar way. There is a splendid opportunity here for some observer to\r\nstudy this phase of butterfly activity and to get photographs of the\r\ninsects amid their natural surroundings.\r\n\r\nIn their book upon \"Concealing Coloration\" the Messrs. Thayer have\r\ncalled attention to many interesting phases of dazzling coloration.\r\nThey show that bright marks like the eye-spots or ocelli, which form\r\nso prominent a feature on the wing surfaces of many butterflies,\r\nreally helped to conceal the insect amid its natural surroundings, by\r\ndrawing the eye away from the outlines of wings and body so that the\r\nlatter tend to disappear. Their discussion of this subject opens up\r\nanother vast field for outdoor observations of absorbing interest, in\r\nwhich there is great need for many active workers.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:                                      _See page 23_\r\n\r\n     BUTTERFLY FEIGNING DEATH, HANGING TO BARK BY ONE FOOT]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:                                      _See page 17_\r\n\r\n     BUTTERFLY IN HIBERNATING POSITION]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Caterpillar feeding upon leaf of milkweed\r\n     Caterpillar hung up for the change to the chrysalis\r\n     The transition stage\r\n     The Chrysalis\r\n\r\n     THE MONARCH BUTTERFLY: CHANGE FROM CATERPILLAR TO CHRYSALIS.\r\n       Photographs from life.

Obviously, were this not true the protective\r\ncoloring would avail but little and it is evident that these moths are\r\nable to select a background which is of advantage in helping to\r\nconceal them.\r\n\r\nThere is much evidence to show that in a similar way the butterflies\r\nare able by means of a well-developed color sense to select the places\r\nwhere they alight. One of the most notable examples is that of a South\r\nAmerican species, _Peridromia feronia_. This is a silvery gray\r\nbutterfly which alights head downward upon the bark of certain palm\r\ntrees that have silvery gray stems and remains there with its wings\r\nfully expanded so that it utilizes the background in much the same way\r\nthat the Underwing moths do. \"When disturbed they will return to the\r\nsame tree again and again.\"\r\n\r\nOne who will observe the habits of our Angle-wings and other\r\nbutterflies which have obliterative coloring of the under wing surface\r\ncan easily learn that these insects select rather carefully the places\r\nwhere they alight. It will be found that as a rule each species\r\nutilizes a background that blends with its own coloring. It is\r\nprobable that this habit is much more common in other groups of\r\nbutterflies than has been realized. Much evidence of this sort has\r\nbeen collected regarding the butterflies of Europe and other\r\ncountries, as well as near our own borders in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING COLORATION AND MIMICRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colors of a great many animals, including a considerable\r\npercentage of American butterflies and their larvae, have been\r\ncommonly explained by the theory of _warning colors_. According to\r\nthis theory animals which were for any reason not edible by birds and\r\nmammals have developed various striking combinations of color such as\r\nblack and yellow, red and black, or black and white, in order to\r\nadvertise to their foes their inedible qualities. This theory has been\r\nvery generally accepted by naturalists and will be found expounded at\r\nlength in many books published during the last quarter century.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of the validity of warning coloration has recently\r\nbeen brought up for reconsideration by the illuminating investigations\r\nof Mr. Abbott H. Thayer and discussed at length in the book upon\r\n\"Concealing Coloration\" already mentioned. In an appendix to this book\r\ndated 1908 Mr. Thayer states that he no longer holds the belief that\r\n\"there must somewhere be warning colors.\" He has convincingly shown\r\nthat a large proportion of the animals which were supposed to be\r\nexamples of this theory are really illustrations of concealing\r\ncoloration. But there yet remain various facts which have been\r\nconclusively proven that apparently require the theory of warning\r\ncolors to explain them. Here is another field in which there is a real\r\nneed for much careful investigation under conditions that are rigidly\r\nscientific.\r\n\r\nAlong with the theory of warning coloration the theory of _mimicry_\r\nhas been propounded. According to this if a butterfly in a given\r\nregion shows warning coloration, having developed such coloration\r\nbecause it is distasteful to birds and mammals, it may be mimicked by\r\nanother butterfly in the same region belonging to another group, the\r\nlatter butterfly being edible, but benefiting by its resemblance to\r\nthe distasteful species, because birds or mammals mistake it for the\r\nlatter and do not attempt to catch it. The most notable example of\r\nsuch mimicry in North America is that of the Monarch butterfly, which\r\nis supposed to be the distasteful species, and the Viceroy butterfly,\r\nwhich is supposed to mimic it. Several other instances of mimicry are\r\nfound among our own butterflies, while in South America, Africa, and\r\nAsia there are numberless examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELIOTROPISM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that the green surfaces of plants respond to\r\nthe stimulus of the sun's rays in a most remarkable manner. This\r\nresponse has commonly been called _heliotropism_ and it has been\r\ncarefully studied by botanists all over the habitable world. More\r\nrecently, the fact has been observed that many animals respond in\r\ncertain definite ways to the stimulus of direct sunshine and the same\r\nterm has been applied in this case. Very little attention has been\r\ngiven to the subject of heliotropism until within a few recent years.\r\nBut the observations which have been made by Parker, Longstaff, Dixey,\r\nand others open up a most interesting field for further observation.\r\nAn admirable summary of our present knowledge of the subject has been\r\npublished by Dr. Longstaff in his book \"Butterfly Hunting in Many\r\nLands.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest observations upon this subject was that published\r\nin my book \"Nature Biographies\" which appeared in June, 1901,\r\nconcerning the habit in the Mourning Cloak: \"On a spring-like day\r\nearly in November (the 8th) I came across one of these butterflies\r\nbasking in the sunshine upon the ties of a railway track. It rested\r\nwith its wings wide open. On being disturbed, it would fly a short\r\ndistance and then alight, and I was interested to notice that after\r\nalighting it would always turn about until the hind end of its body\r\npointed in the direction of the sun, so that the sun's rays struck its\r\nwings and body nearly at right angles. I repeatedly observed this\r\nhabit of getting into the position in which the most benefit from the\r\nsunshine was received, and it is of interest as showing the extreme\r\ndelicacy of perception toward the warmth of sunshine which these\r\ncreatures possess.\"\r\n\r\nA little later, some very elaborate observations were made upon this\r\nhabit of the Mourning Cloak by Prof. G. H. Parker of Harvard\r\nUniversity. Professor Parker noticed that during the warm spells in\r\nwinter the butterflies came out of their hiding places and after\r\nalighting, always placed themselves with their heads away from the\r\ndirection of the sun and their bodies lying nearly at right angles to\r\nthe sun's rays. By experiment, he found that they adjusted themselves\r\nto this position as soon as they were fully exposed to direct\r\nsunshine, even if at the time of alighting they were in a shadow. He\r\nfound that this movement was a reflex action through the eyes, for\r\nwhen the eyes were blinded no such adjustment took place. He called it\r\n_negative heliotropism_.\r\n\r\nDr. Longstaff uses the term _orientation_ for this adjustment of the\r\nbutterfly to the sun's rays and he finds it is a very general habit,\r\nespecially with the Angle-wings, for the butterfly thus to orient\r\nitself after alighting, in such a way that the hind end of the body\r\npoints toward the sun. This occurs not only with those species which\r\nkeep their wings spread open when they alight but also with those in\r\nwhich the wings are closed together and held in a vertical position on\r\nalighting.\r\n\r\nVarious explanations of this phenomenon have been offered but\r\napparently none of them are yet generally accepted. Were the habit\r\nconfined to butterflies like the Mourning Cloak, it would seem easy to\r\nprove that a main advantage was found in the benefit derived from the\r\nheat rays of the sun. Were it confined to those species which always\r\nfold their wings on alighting, it would seem easy to believe that it\r\nwas a device for reducing the shadow cast by the insect to its lowest\r\nterms. It has also been suggested that the habit is for the purpose of\r\nrevealing to the fullest extent the markings of the butterfly.\r\nEvidently there is here an ample field for further investigation\r\nbefore definite conclusions are reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST AND SHADOW OBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother field for most interesting studies upon the habits of living\r\nbutterflies has been opened up by the very interesting discussion of\r\n_list and shadow_ in Colonel G. B. Longstaff's fascinating book,\r\n\"Butterfly Hunting in Many Lands.\" He there summarizes his numerous\r\nobservations upon butterflies in various localities which he has seen\r\nto lean over at a decided angle when they alight. He defines \"_List_\"\r\nas \"an attitude resulting from the rotation of the insect about its\r\nlongitudinal axis, as heliotropism results from a rotation about an\r\nimaginary vertical axis at right angles to this.\" The name is adapted\r\nfrom the sailors' term applied to a vessel leaning to one side or\r\nanother in a storm.\r\n\r\nApparently this interesting habit was first called to the attention of\r\nEuropean entomologists by an observation of Colonel C. T. Bingham\r\nmade in 1878, but not published until long afterward. The observation\r\nwas this:\r\n\r\n\"The _Melanitis_ was there among dead leaves, its wings folded and\r\nlooking for all the world a dead, dry leaf itself. With regard to\r\nMelanitis, I have not seen it recorded anywhere that the species of\r\nthis genus when disturbed fly a little way, drop suddenly into the\r\nundergrowth with closed wings, and invariably lie a little askew and\r\nslanting, which still more increases their likeness to a dead leaf\r\ncasually fallen to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nLong before this was printed, however, a similar habit had been\r\nobserved by Scudder in the case of our White Mountain butterfly\r\n(_Oenis semidea_). But this species is so exceptional in its habitat\r\nthat the habit seems to have been considered a special adaptation to\r\nthe wind-swept mountain top. The possibility of its being at all\r\ngeneral among the butterflies in lowlands seems to have been\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nThe observations recorded by Longstaff relate chiefly to various\r\nmembers of the Satyrid group. For example, a common Grayling, _Satyrus\r\nsemele_, was watched many times as it settled on the ground. As a rule\r\nthree motions are gone through in regular sequence: the wings are\r\nbrought together over the back; the forewings are drawn between the\r\nhind wings; the whole is thrown over to right or left to the extent of\r\nthirty, forty, or even fifty degrees.\r\n\r\nThis habit, of course, is of advantage to the insect. It seems\r\npossible that the advantage might be explained in either of two ways:\r\nfirst, the leaning over on the ground among grasses and fallen leaves\r\nmight help to render the disguising coloration of the insect more\r\neffective, the large ocelli serving to draw the eye away from the\r\noutline of body and wing; second, the listing of the butterfly toward\r\nthe sun tends to reduce the shadow and to hide it beneath the wings.\r\nThere is no doubt that when a Grayling butterfly lights upon the\r\nground in strong sunshine the shadow it casts is more conspicuous than\r\nthe insect itself and the hiding of this might be of distinct\r\nadvantage in helping it to escape observation. It is significant that\r\nin England the butterflies observed appear to lean over more\r\nfrequently in sunshine than in shade. An observation of Mr. E. G.\r\nWaddilove, reported by Colonel Longstaff, is interesting in this\r\nconnection:\r\n\r\n\"A Grayling settled on a patch of bare black peat earth, shut up its\r\nwings vertically, and crawled at once some two yards to the edge of\r\nthe patch to where some fir-needles, a cone or two, and a few brittle\r\ntwigs were lying, and then becoming stationary threw itself over at an\r\nangle of some forty-five degrees square to the sun. It thus became\r\nquite indistinguishable from its surroundings.\"\r\n\r\nApparently, some of the Angle-wings may have the same habit, for in\r\nBarrett's \"Lepidoptera of the British Islands,\" there is a note in\r\nregard to _Grapta C-album_ to the effect that it is fond of sunning\r\nitself in roads, on warm walls, or on the ground upon dead leaves in\r\nsheltered valleys. \"Here, if the sun becomes overclouded, it will\r\nsometimes close its wings and almost lie down, in such a manner that\r\nto distinguish its brown and green marbled under side from the dead\r\nleaves is almost impossible.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a most fascinating opportunity for American observers to\r\ndetermine definitely the facts in regard to our numerous species of\r\nbutterflies that may show this habit. An observer with a reflex type\r\nof camera might easily be able to get pictures that would be of great\r\nvalue in helping to determine the principal facts in regard to the\r\nsubject. Our common Graylings and numerous species of Angle-wings are\r\nso abundant and easily observed that they offer splendid opportunities\r\nto any one who will undertake a serious study of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITIC ENEMIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAll three of the earlier stages of butterflies--egg, larva, and\r\nchrysalis--are subject to attack by various parasitic insects which\r\ndevelop at the expense of the host. Such parasites are probably the\r\nmost important check upon the increase of butterflies, and along with\r\nbirds, mammals, and bacterial diseases, they help to keep up that\r\nbalance of nature which in the long run maintains a surprising\r\nuniformity in the numbers of each kind of butterfly.\r\n\r\nFor the most part these insect parasites are small four-winged flies,\r\nalthough many of them are two-winged flies. In either case the life\r\nstages show a series of changes much like those of the butterflies\r\nthemselves. Each parasite exists first as an egg, second as a larva,\r\nthird as a pupa, and fourth as an adult fly. The larval stage,\r\nhowever, is simply that of a footless grub which lives within the body\r\nof its victim absorbing its life blood and gradually killing it.\r\n\r\nThe parasites of butterfly eggs are legion. They are tiny flies whose\r\nlife-story in briefest summary is this: The butterfly lays an egg. The\r\nparasite fly finds this egg soon after it is laid, and pierces the\r\nshell with her tiny, sharply pointed ovipositor and deposits inside of\r\nthe shell her own microscopic egg. This egg within the egg soon\r\nhatches into a curious little larva that develops at the expense of\r\nthe contents of the butterfly egg shell, and soon absorbs the whole\r\nof them. The parasite larva now changes to a pupa which a little later\r\nchanges again to an adult fly like the one that laid the parasite egg\r\nin the beginning. Of course the butterfly egg never hatches into a\r\ncaterpillar.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting questions in regard to these egg parasites\r\nis this: How does the tiny parasitic fly find the newly laid egg? One\r\nwould think that the proverbial search for a needle in a haymow would\r\nbe an easy task compared with that of a fly about as large as the head\r\nof a pin finding a butterfly egg of similar size upon some part of one\r\nof the millions of leaves upon the trees and shrubs in field and\r\nforest. Yet the search is successful, as every one who has tried to\r\nget caterpillars from eggs found out of doors will testify. On a later\r\npage in this book, in connection with the story of the life of the\r\nMourning Cloak butterfly, I have recorded some observations upon the\r\nlittle parasite which seemed to have been riding around upon the body\r\nof the butterfly waiting for her to lay her eggs.\r\n\r\nFor one parasite upon the eggs of butterflies, there probably are\r\ndozens that attack the caterpillars. A large proportion of the\r\nbutterfly larvae brought in from outdoors, especially those which are\r\nhalf-grown or more, will yield not butterflies but parasites. This is\r\nthe experience of practically every one who attempts to rear these\r\ninsects, and it emphasizes the value of the advice that in order to\r\nget fine specimens, it is desirable to rear them from eggs laid by\r\nbutterflies beneath netting or in cages.\r\n\r\nThe life-histories of the parasites that attack caterpillars vary\r\ngreatly. The simplest are those of the large Ichneumon flies: The\r\nmother fly lays an egg beneath the skin of the caterpillar. The egg\r\nhatches into a larva that absorbs the fatty parts of the body of the\r\ncaterpillar, gradually growing larger and larger until at last it\r\nreaches a length of possibly an inch. By this time it is likely to\r\nhave absorbed so large a part of the inside of the caterpillar that\r\nthe latter dies. The parasite larva now changes to a pupa, either\r\ninside or outside the skin of the caterpillar, and a little later\r\nchanges again to an adult Ichneumon fly.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Tachinid Parasite: _a_, fly; _b_, puparium,\r\n     magnified.]\r\n\r\nIn the case just given, one egg only was deposited within the skin of\r\nthe caterpillar. In many others, however, a large number of eggs may\r\nbe so deposited by a single fly. A special group of Ichneumon flies,\r\ncalled the Microgasters, contains many parasites that have this\r\npeculiarity. The Microgaster larvae on coming forth from the\r\ncaterpillar have the habit of spinning tiny cocoons within which they\r\nchange to pupae. By collecting some cabbage worms which are nearly\r\nfull grown, and keeping them in a glass jar one can generally get a\r\nconsiderable number of these Microgaster cocoons and rear the flies\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nAnother group of caterpillar parasites is still more minute. They are\r\ncalled the Chalcid flies. Their life-histories are full of interest,\r\nand might easily furnish opportunity for a long lifetime of study and\r\nexperiment. One is likely to get hundreds of these Chalcid flies from\r\na single caterpillar.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting group of parasites is that of the two-winged\r\nTachina flies (_see cut on this page_). The life-story of some of\r\nthese is comparatively simple: a buzzing fly, looking much like a\r\nlarge housefly, lays a small whitish egg upon the skin of a\r\ncaterpillar. This egg is glued tightly and is large enough to be\r\nreadily seen by the unaided eye. It hatches into a tiny larva that\r\neats its way through the part of the shell glued to the caterpillar's\r\nskin, and through the latter at the same time. So the newly hatched\r\nTachina larva finds itself in the body of its caterpillar host. It\r\nlives there, absorbing the fatty juices around it until at last it\r\neither kills or stupefies its unfortunate victim. It has then become\r\nfull grown as a larva, and its last larval skin hardens into a brown\r\npupa-case within which the little creature changes into a pupa. It may\r\nor may not have burrowed through the skin of the caterpillar before\r\nthis happened. A little later the pupa changes to a Tachina fly which\r\nbreaks apart the pupa-case and flies out into the world.\r\n\r\nIt has lately been found, however, that many Tachinids have much more\r\ncomplicated life-histories than this. I have already discussed some of\r\nthe more important of these in my book entitled, \"Seeing Nature First\"\r\n(_pages 150-158_).\r\n\r\nOne can frequently rear parasites from the chrysalids of butterflies,\r\nbut in many cases it is probable that these began their parasitic\r\ndevelopment in the caterpillars, which were able to change to\r\nchrysalids before being killed. In some cases, however, the chrysalids\r\nseem to be attacked, especially by certain Ichneumon flies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREARING BUTTERFLIES FROM CATERPILLARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few things in the world more interesting to watch than the\r\nwonderful changes which a moth or butterfly goes through in the\r\ncourse of its life. You find on a tree or shrub a worm-like\r\ncaterpillar. You take it in charge, placing it in a box or jar where\r\nyou can provide leaves for its food and soon it either spins around\r\nitself a silken shroud, thus hiding from your sight, or else it simply\r\nseems to change to a lifeless object without eyes or wings or legs,\r\nunable to move about and motionless, save for a slight wriggle when\r\nyou touch it. Yet if you keep the shroud or the mummy-like object for\r\ntwo or three weeks you are likely to see a beautiful moth come from\r\nthe shroud or a glorious butterfly break out of the mummy case. (_See\r\nplate, page 49._) So you can get the realest kind of moving pictures\r\nby simply bringing in the caterpillars that are easily found in\r\ngarden, field, and wood.\r\n\r\nTo collect these caterpillars it is only necessary to be provided with\r\na pair of sharp eyes and an empty coffee can or some other form of tin\r\nbox. Go out into the garden or along the borders of the woods. Look\r\ncarefully. If you see places where leaves have been eaten, search the\r\nleaves near by and you are likely to find one or more of the\r\ncaterpillars that caused the injury. Transfer them to the box and take\r\nthem home with a few leaves of the food plant. There place them in\r\nsome form of vivarium, which simply means a box or cage in which you\r\ncan keep living creatures.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory cages for rearing caterpillars are those which\r\nare open above so that there is not even a glass plate between the\r\nobserver and the insect. This kind of vivarium is easily made by using\r\na band of some sticky substance like the tree tanglefoot with which\r\ntrees are commonly banded, or a strip of sticky fly paper. Any wide\r\nshallow box may be used by simply placing an inch-wide band of the\r\nsticky material around the vertical sides near the top. The\r\ncaterpillars will be free to move all over the open box but they\r\ncannot cross the band to escape. Fresh leaves are easily placed in the\r\nopen box and the withered ones removed.\r\n\r\nThe same plan may be adopted with wide glass jars, like the ordinary\r\nbattery jar. Choose a rather large one and smear the inner side near\r\nthe top with a band of sticky material. The caterpillars are thus\r\nprevented from crawling out, but they are open to observation at all\r\ntimes. (_See plate, pages 48-49._)\r\n\r\nIn the case of the caterpillars that change to butterflies no soil\r\nneed be placed in the bottom of the jar as these will attach their\r\nchrysalids to the sides or to a stick or board which may easily be put\r\nin. In the case of many caterpillars that change to moths, however, it\r\nis desirable to place about two inches of soil in the bottom of the\r\njar. Then if the caterpillars are not cocoon spinners they can burrow\r\ninto the soil when they are ready to change to pupae.\r\n\r\nInstead of applying the sticky material directly to the glass a strip\r\nof sticky fly paper may be glued to it.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the butterfly caterpillar easiest to find lives upon\r\ncabbages. Go into the garden and you are likely to see a dozen green\r\ncaterpillars upon as many cabbage plants. Bring in several of the\r\nlarger ones and place them in a vivarium with some fresh cabbage\r\nleaves. In a few days some of them will be likely to fasten themselves\r\nto the vertical sides of the vivarium and shed the caterpillar skin.\r\nEach thus becomes a chrysalis. About ten days later this chrysalis\r\nskin will break open and a white Cabbage butterfly will come out.\r\n\r\nSo your caterpillar goes through the four different stages of insect\r\nlife. It was first an egg laid upon the leaf by a butterfly; the egg\r\nhatched into the caterpillar or larva; the larva changed to the\r\nchrysalis; the chrysalis changed to the butterfly or adult insect.\r\n\r\nOne of the most satisfactory ways to rear the caterpillars of\r\nbutterflies is to get the females to lay their eggs upon the food\r\nplant. In the case of many species this is not difficult. The simplest\r\nway is to enclose the mother butterfly in a small gauze bag tied over\r\nthe branch of the food plant. If she has eggs ready to deposit she is\r\nvery likely to lay them under these conditions. After they are laid\r\nthe mother butterfly may be allowed to escape, but it is well to\r\nreplace the gauze protection as a safeguard against many sorts of\r\nenemies which may destroy the eggs or the young caterpillars that\r\nhatch from them. Another way is to enclose the butterflies with a twig\r\nof the food plant in a glass jar, sealing it tight to prevent the\r\nleaves from wilting. The butterfly is likely after she has quieted\r\ndown to lay her eggs upon the leaves. According to William G. Wright,\r\nwho speaks from his long experience with the butterflies of the West\r\nCoast, these genera will lay their eggs on anything: Parnassius,\r\nArgynnis, Euptoieta, Neonympha, and all members of the family\r\nSatyridae. In these cases one can get the eggs by simply enclosing the\r\nbutterflies in glass jars or gauze nets without even the leaves of the\r\nfood plant. William H. Edwards found in his long experience that one\r\ncan get the eggs of practically all butterflies in confinement,\r\nprovided only the insects are sufficiently mature so that the eggs are\r\nready to be laid. He found that the cause of failure to get eggs from\r\nmany of the Fritillaries early in the season was that the eggs were\r\nnot mature and that from the same kinds of butterflies with which he\r\nfailed early in the summer he got plenty of eggs in September.\r\n\r\nThere is here a rich field for observation and experiment for every\r\nnaturalist who wishes to take up the study of butterflies. He can be\r\nsure of the parentage of the caterpillars and can trace them from the\r\nvery moment of egg-laying through all their wonderful changes until\r\nthey become butterflies again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHING BUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a famous old saying that to make hare stew it is first\r\nnecessary to catch your hare. So if one wishes to make perfect\r\npictures of butterflies it is first necessary to get the caterpillars.\r\nFor though caterpillars are not butterflies they are butterflies in\r\nthe making and they will show you most interesting stages in nature's\r\nmanufacture of these dainty and exquisite creatures. This is not,\r\nhowever, the chief reason why the photographer should get them. He\r\nwill wish to make perfect pictures and in order to do this he must\r\nhave not only perfect specimens but living butterflies which are\r\nwilling to look pleasant while he makes comparatively long exposures\r\nunder conditions of light that he can control. If you catch a\r\nbutterfly outdoors and bring it in you will be likely to find that it\r\nis by no means a docile subject. The sunlight shining through the\r\nnearest window will be a call which you cannot counteract and your\r\nbutterfly will constantly respond to it in a most vexing manner. So\r\nyou must catch the butterfly young and take advantage of a brief but\r\ndocile period in their lives when they are willing to pose before your\r\ncamera in quite a remarkable manner. This is the period just after\r\nthe butterfly emerges from the chrysalis when its wings are fully\r\ndeveloped but before the tissues have hardened and the muscles in the\r\nthorax are strong enough for flight. At this time the butterfly is\r\nperfect, every scale is in its place and every spot of color is at its\r\nbest, and it will rest quietly upon a flower, leaf, or twig while you\r\nadjust the camera and expose the plate. From one such specimen one can\r\nget many pictures upon different flowers and with different angles of\r\nview. (_See plates, pages 160, 225._)\r\n\r\nIn order to make admirable photographs of living butterflies it is by\r\nno means necessary to have a regular photographic studio. If one has a\r\nroom lighted from the north or east one can arrange for exposure near\r\nthe window, using cardboard reflectors to make the light more even\r\nfrom both sides. In such a situation one soon learns the exposure\r\nperiods required and can easily get many beautiful photographs.\r\n\r\nA collection of prints of the butterflies of one's locality would be\r\none of the most interesting photographic exhibits that an amateur\r\ncould select. It is comparatively easy to get rather full sets showing\r\nthe life-histories of several of our larger species and such sets are\r\nof course of especial interest. In the case of those caterpillars\r\nwhich make nests upon the food plant, like the Painted Beauty larva\r\nwhich remains for weeks feeding upon the leaves of the common wild\r\neverlasting, the taking of the pictures of the different stages is\r\ncomparatively easy. One can keep the plant with the stem in water, and\r\nget the caterpillar to change to the chrysalis, and emerge as the\r\nbutterfly, in the nest made from the flower heads and the upper\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by W.

They are easily obtained, easily\r\npreserved, and retain their beauty for a long period even under\r\nexposure to strong light. They offer opportunities for serious study\r\nin which one cannot only review the facts which others have already\r\ndiscovered, but also hope to contribute something of value to the sum\r\nof human knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe mistake most commonly made by beginners with butterflies, as with\r\nother collections, is to undertake too much. Instead of starting on\r\nthe hopeless task of making a collection of the butterflies of the\r\nworld, it is much better to start with the intention of making a\r\ncollection of those of one's own town. In the latter case one can hope\r\nsoon to attain the desired end and then, if one wishes, it is a simple\r\nmatter to reach out and make a collection of the butterflies of the\r\nstate or even of the particular region in which the state is located.\r\nThe natural limitations for a collection in New England is to make a\r\ncollection of New England butterflies. There is a splendid example of\r\nsuch a collection on exhibition in the museum of the Boston Society of\r\nNatural History. This contains representatives of practically every\r\nkind that has been collected in New England, and yet there are less\r\nthan a hundred species in all. So it is apparent that a local\r\ncollection should be attainable by any enthusiastic student and the\r\nvery fact that the number of species is limited adds interest and\r\nsatisfaction to the pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe main value of any collection of objects lies in the point of view\r\nof the collector. The most natural point of view for a beginner is\r\nthat of the local fauna, as indicated in the previous paragraph. Such\r\na collection best serves as a basis for a study of the subject but it\r\nmay well lead to a broader field through some special phase of\r\nscientific interest. Thus while it would be hopeless for most persons\r\nto attempt a collection of the butterflies of the world it would be\r\nentirely reasonable for one to start a collection of all the species\r\nin the world of any given genus or tribe, and such a set of specimens\r\nwould soon come to possess decided scientific value. Or, instead of\r\nthe point of view of generic or family relationship, one could take\r\nthe point of view of special geographical distribution. Thus a\r\ncollection of all the butterflies found within a certain number of\r\ndegrees of the North Pole showing the circumpolar butterfly fauna\r\nwould have great scientific interest.\r\n\r\nThere are also various other points of view which could be followed in\r\nmaking a collection. There are already in many of the museums of the\r\nworld collections of butterflies which illustrate the various phases\r\nof true mimicry--the resemblance of one species to another in the same\r\nregion. This is a field in which one could spend a lifetime of\r\nendeavor, and secure results of great value to the world of science.\r\nAn easier problem for most collectors in the United States would be a\r\ncollection made from the point of view of resemblance to environment,\r\nincluding such examples as the Angle-wings that show a bark-like set\r\nof marks on the under surface. Yet another point of view would be that\r\nof hibernation, the making of a collection of all butterflies that\r\nhibernate as adults.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few suggestions. There are many other phases of\r\nbutterfly life which could be utilized as the basis for interesting\r\ncollections. The important thing is to have a definite object in view\r\nand to make the collection a basis for a real study of the subject, so\r\nthat the collector will not only be growing intellectually but will\r\nalso be making a real contribution to our scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collecting Apparatus_\r\n\r\nTo collect and preserve butterflies in proper condition for study,\r\ncertain apparatus is necessary. Perhaps the first essential is the\r\ncollecting net for catching butterflies in the field. The simplest way\r\nto obtain this is to buy it of the dealers in entomological supplies.\r\nNets in considerable variety and at various prices are offered in the\r\ncatalogues of these firms. One can make, however, a net at home with\r\nlittle difficulty. One need only obtain an iron wire about one fifth\r\nof an inch in diameter and bend it into a circular ring a foot or\r\nfifteen inches wide, leaving the ends projecting at right angles to\r\nthe circle and having a blacksmith weld them together so as to form a\r\nspur about four inches long. Now thrust this spur into some convenient\r\nhandle, such as a broomstick, and sew over the wire circle a bag of\r\nmosquito netting, Swiss muslin, or some similar fabric. It is better\r\nthat this material be green or black rather than white.\r\n\r\nAfter the butterflies are caught, they must be killed, so some form of\r\nkilling bottle is necessary. Most collectors use a cyanide bottle, in\r\nwhich the fumes of cyanide of potassium kill the insects. One of the\r\nbest ways to make this is to place in a wide-mouthed bottle two or\r\nthree lumps of cyanide of potassium, approximately an inch across.\r\nOver this place some fine sawdust and on top of the sawdust, pour\r\nliquid plaster of paris carefully so that it will harden into a layer\r\nabout half an inch thick. Allow the plaster to become thoroughly dry,\r\nthen insert the stopper into the bottle and it will be ready for use.\r\nIt is better to use a ground glass stopper so that the bottle will\r\nalways be air tight. The sawdust is often omitted, the plaster of\r\nparis being poured directly over the cyanide. The special advantage of\r\nthe sawdust is that it tends to absorb the cyanide in case it\r\nliquefies, as it often does in damp weather. As this cyanide is a\r\ndeadly poison, it is better to let a druggist prepare the bottle or\r\nelse to buy it already prepared of the dealers in such supplies.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Butterfly Envelopes. Fold first on line _AB_;\r\n     then on _AD_ and _CB_; then on _BF_ and _EA_. (From Holland).]\r\n\r\nAfter the specimens have been killed in the cyanide bottle, some\r\nmethod of keeping them is necessary. The simplest way is to preserve\r\nthem with their wings closed together in pieces of paper folded over\r\ninto triangles as indicated on the accompanying diagrams. Such\r\nspecimens may be kept for an indefinite time and if one wishes to\r\nmount them later, it is only necessary to place them for a few hours\r\nin a relaxing jar, which is simply a closed vessel with enough water\r\nin the bottom to saturate the air with moisture. A great advantage of\r\nkeeping the specimens in these paper covers is that they require so\r\nlittle room and are easily stored away in tin cans or boxes where they\r\nare safe from dust and destroying enemies.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Setting Board with Butterfly in place.\r\n     (From Holland)]\r\n\r\nThose butterflies which are to be preserved in the ordinary way, in\r\ndrawers or cabinets, must be spread out and held in position while the\r\nbody is drying so that the wings will remain expanded. For this\r\npurpose, some form of a setting board is necessary. These may be\r\nbought of dealers or made at home. One of the simplest kinds consists\r\nof two thin strips of pine board, a foot or more long, nailed to end\r\npieces with a space between the two boards wide enough to accommodate\r\nthe bodies of the butterflies. Beneath this open space, a piece of\r\nthin cork is tacked. The pin on which the butterfly is fastened is\r\npushed through the cork until the wings of the insect are level with\r\nthe boards. The wings are then brought forward with a needle point\r\nuntil they are in the desired position and they are then held in place\r\nby pieces of glass or by bits of cardboard fastened down by pins. The\r\nbutterflies must be left in this position until thoroughly dry.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Drying Box for Setting Boards. (After Riley)]\r\n\r\nSpecial insect pins should be used for butterflies. These are longer\r\nthan common pins and have rounded heads. They are offered for sale by\r\nentomological dealers. Instead of pinning the insects and preserving\r\nthem in cabinets, one may keep them in the Riker mounts, which have\r\nthe advantage of being sealed so that there is no chance for dust or\r\nmuseum pests to reach the specimens. If one wishes to collect\r\nextensively, one will need a considerable number of setting boards and\r\nit will be worth while to prepare for them a special drying box like\r\nthat shown in the picture above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE BUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERFAMILY _Papilionoidea_\r\n\r\nThe great suborder of butterflies is commonly separated into two\r\nprincipal groups called superfamilies. One of these includes all of\r\nthe higher butterflies and is named _Papilionoidea_. The other\r\nincludes the lower Skipper butterflies and is named the\r\n_Hesperioidea_. The former are characterized by small bodies and\r\nrelatively large wings, straight clubbed antennae, and the fact that\r\nthe caterpillars do not make cocoons when preparing for the chrysalis\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe most authoritative classifications of butterfly families are based\r\nupon the peculiarities of wing venation and are admirably discussed in\r\nsuch books as Holland's \"Butterfly Book\" and Comstock's \"How to Know\r\nthe Butterflies.\" Without attempting to go into the technical details\r\nof structure it will suffice here to give the list of families which\r\ncompose the superfamily _Papilionoidea_:\r\n\r\n    The Parnassians. _Parnassiidae._\r\n    The Swallowtails. _Papilionidae._\r\n    The Whites, Orange-tips, and Yellows. _Pieridae._\r\n    The Nymphs. _Nymphalidae._\r\n    The Satyrs or Meadow-browns. _Agapetidae._\r\n    The Heliconians. _Heliconidae._\r\n    The Milkweed Butterflies. _Lymnadidae._\r\n    The Long-beaks. _Libytheidae._\r\n    The Metal-marks. _Riodinidae._\r\n    The Gossamer-wings. _Lycaenidae._\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that such a list necessarily indicates the\r\ndegrees of development of the respective families, for this is not\r\ntrue. It is simply a linear arrangement adopted for convenience by\r\nleading authorities, notably Dr. Harrison G. Dyar in his standard\r\n\"Catalog of American Lepidoptera.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARNASSIAN BUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Parnassiidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps a bit unfortunate that the group of butterflies, which\r\nis commonly chosen to head the list of families, is one that is rarely\r\nseen by most collectors. The Parnassians are butterflies of the far\r\nnorth or of high elevations in the mountains. The four species\r\ncredited to North America have been collected in Alaska and the higher\r\nelevations of the Rocky Mountains, so there is very little probability\r\nof any of them being found in the Eastern states.\r\n\r\nWhile, structurally, these butterflies have a close affinity with the\r\nSwallowtails, one would never suspect it from their general\r\nappearance. Their bodies are large and all of the wings well rounded,\r\nso that there is more of the suggestion of a large moth than of the\r\nSwallowtail. The coloring is also more moth-like than with most\r\nbutterflies, the wings being very light colored and nearly\r\ntransparent, with markings of gray and brown, arranged in dots and\r\nsplashes.\r\n\r\nAll our species belong to the genus Parnassius. The caterpillars show\r\ntheir affinity with those of the Swallowtails by having the curious\r\nscent organs or osmateria just back of the head. They feed upon such\r\nalpine plants as stonecrop and saxifrage and are well adapted by their\r\nstructure and habits to the bleak surroundings of the mountain tops.\r\n\r\nAs a typical example of the environment in which these butterflies\r\nlive, we may take the alpine valleys of such mountain regions as\r\nPike's Peak. Prof. M. J. Elrod has described a visit where, at an\r\naltitude of 11,500 feet in the month of August, _Parnassius smintheus_\r\nwas flying by thousands, and the earlier stages were so abundant that\r\na water ditch had the surface covered as far as one could see with the\r\ndead or dying caterpillars. In such situations, where ice forms at\r\nnight, and snow frequently falls by day, these butterflies develop\r\napparently in greater numbers than almost any of our other species are\r\nknown to do in warmer regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWALLOWTAILS\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Papilionidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is probably the most distinctive family of all our familiar\r\nbutterflies. Its members are characterized by being on the whole the\r\nlargest butterflies in our region and by having the hind wings\r\nprolonged into curious tail-like projections, suggestive of those of a\r\nswallow. In general, the basal color of the wings is blackish though\r\nthis is commonly marked in various striking ways with yellow, green,\r\nor blue, while the margins of the wings are commonly adorned with red\r\nor orange spots. These butterflies are also characterized by certain\r\npeculiarities in the branching of the wing veins which will be found\r\npictured in more technical works.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of these butterflies have the characteristic form\r\npictured on the plate of the Swallowtails opposite page _80_. When\r\nfull grown they are large, fairly smooth-bodied worms, showing at most\r\non the surface sparse fine hairs or fleshy threadlike projections.\r\nTheir most characteristic feature is found in the scent organs called\r\n_osmateria_ situated in the back just behind the head. These are\r\nthrust out, generally, when the caterpillar is disturbed and appear as\r\norange Y- or V-shaped organs from which an offensive odor is commonly\r\ngiven off. They are supposed to serve the purpose of preventing injury\r\nby enemies, possibly birds, monkeys, and other vertebrates.\r\nStructurally, they are like long tubular pockets that can be turned\r\ninside out. When the pocket is in place it is getting a pocketful of\r\nodors. When it is inverted it lets these odors free. On this account\r\nProfessor Comstock has aptly called these caterpillars \"the polecats\r\nof the insect world.\"\r\n\r\nWhen ready to pupate, these Papilio caterpillars spin a web of silk\r\nupon some more or less flattened surface and a loop of silk near by.\r\nThey entangle their hind legs in the former and keep their heads\r\nthrough the latter so the loop supports the body a little behind the\r\nhead. Then they change to chrysalids which are held in place by these\r\nsets of silken threads.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalids are rather large and angular and generally take on\r\ncolors approximating their surroundings. They vary so much in\r\ndifferent species that one familiar with them can recognize the\r\nchrysalis and know the kind of butterfly it will produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Black Swallowtail=\r\n  _Papilio polyxenes_\r\n\r\nWhile the Black Swallowtail is not so large as some other members of\r\nthe group, it is probably the best known to most people. It is found\r\nthroughout many months of the year in practically all parts of North\r\nAmerica south of Canada, and has the habit of flying freely about\r\nfields and gardens in search of flowers from which to suck its nectar\r\nfood, and of plants on which to deposit its eggs. The female\r\nbutterflies have a remarkable ability in selecting only members of the\r\ngreat family Umbelliferae for this purpose. In consequence the\r\ncaterpillars are generally to be found feeding upon carrots, parsnips,\r\nparsley, and various wild species belonging to this order. (_See\r\nplates, pages 48 and 64-65._)\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the Black Swallowtail are laid one in a place upon the\r\nleaves of the food plant. Each egg is a small, yellowish, smooth, and\r\novoid object. It may often be found by watching the butterflies as\r\nthey fly low in search of umbelliferous plants, and seeing one stop\r\nfor a minute or so while she lays the egg.\r\n\r\nAbout ten days after the egg is laid it hatches into a small black\r\ncaterpillar marked in a characteristic fashion with a blotch of white\r\nin the middle of the body which is suggestive of a saddle. The\r\ncaterpillar immediately begins to feed upon the green substance of the\r\nleaf, continuing thus about a week before the first moult. At this\r\ntime it does not change much in appearance, still being a spiny\r\ncreature blackish in color and marked by the curious white saddle. A\r\nlittle later it moults again, retaining its original coloring. At each\r\nmoult, of course, it gets larger and feeds more freely upon the celery\r\nor other plant on which it may happen to be.\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar becomes about half grown it takes on a very\r\ndifferent appearance from that of its early life. The skin is smooth\r\nrather than spiny, and the general colors are green, black, and\r\nyellow. The ground color of the skin is green, which is marked with\r\nblack cross-bands along the middle of each body ring. On these bands\r\nthere are many large dots of orange yellow, the whole coloring giving\r\nthe insect a very striking appearance, especially when it is placed by\r\nitself against a plain background. When they finally become full grown\r\nin this larva state, these caterpillars are almost two inches long.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the Black Swallowtail have certain characteristics in\r\nwhich they differ from many other caterpillars. After each moult they\r\ndo not devour their cast skins, which happens in the case of many of\r\ntheir relatives. When feeding, as well as when resting, they remain\r\nexposed upon the leaf and seem never to attempt to conceal themselves,\r\nas is the habit with a large proportion of caterpillars. It is\r\nprobable that this instinct for remaining exposed to view bears some\r\nrelation to the curious means of protection possessed by this as well\r\nas other Swallowtail caterpillars. When disturbed one of these larvae\r\nwill push out from just back of the head the strange-looking,\r\norange-yellow Y-shaped organ which gives off a very disagreeable odor.\r\nThese osmateria organs are generally believed to be defensive against\r\nthe attack of birds and various other enemies, although they seem not\r\nto be effective against insect parasites.\r\n\r\nThe full-grown caterpillars are likely to leave their food plants when\r\nready to change to the chrysalis state. They wander in various\r\ndirections until suitable shelter is found. A piece of board, a fence\r\npost, or possibly the bark of a tree will answer for this purpose.\r\nHere the caterpillar spins a mat of silk in which to entangle its hind\r\nlegs and a short distance away near the front end of the body it spins\r\na loop of silk attaching the ends to the support. These serve to hold\r\nthe chrysalis in place during this helpless period. After the loop is\r\nmade the caterpillar keeps its head through it so that the loop holds\r\nthe insect in position a short distance back of the head. It is now\r\nready to moult its last caterpillar skin and become a chrysalis.\r\n\r\nOne who has watched hundreds of these caterpillars go through this\r\nchange, Miss Mary C. Dickerson, describes the process in these words:\r\n\"In this final moult the chrysalis has to work very hard. The bulk of\r\nthe body is again slipped forward in the loosened caterpillar skin, so\r\nthat this becomes tensely stretched over the anterior end, and very\r\nmuch wrinkled at the posterior end. The skin splits back of the head\r\nand is forced back by its own taut condition and by the efforts of the\r\nchrysalis, until only the extreme posterior end of the chrysalis is\r\nwithin it. Then the chrysalis withdraws this posterior end with its\r\nmany very tiny hooks, from the skin on the dorsal side, and, reaching\r\naround, securely fastens the hooks into the button of silk. Then the\r\nold skin is removed both from its fastening to the chrysalis and from\r\nits attachment in the button of silk.\"\r\n\r\nA short time after the caterpillar's skin has thus been cast off the\r\nchrysalis takes on a brownish color which as is so often the case is\r\nlikely to vary somewhat according to the tint of the surrounding\r\nsurfaces. This is doubtless a protective device and helps the insect\r\nto escape attack by birds during the long period of exposure. For this\r\nbutterfly passes through the winter only in the chrysalis condition,\r\nand the larva which went into the chrysalis in September does not come\r\nout as a butterfly until the following May or June. There are,\r\nhowever, two broods of the butterflies in the North and at least three\r\nin the South. As the adults live for about two months and there is\r\nconsiderable variation in the periods of their development it happens\r\nthat one can find these Black Swallowtail butterflies upon the wing\r\nalmost any time in warm weather, either North or South.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Giant Swallowtail=\r\n  _Papilio thoas_\r\n\r\nThe largest of our North American butterflies is a magnificent insect\r\nwith a wing expanse of some four inches and with a rich coloring of\r\nblack and yellow more or less suffused with greenish or bluish\r\niridescence that gives it a striking beauty as it flies leisurely\r\nabout from flower to flower or stops to lay an egg upon some bush or\r\ntree. The tails are long and expanded toward the tip, their prevailing\r\ncolor being black with a broad splash of yellow near the end. In a\r\ngeneral way we may say that the upper wing surface is black marked\r\nwith two bands of orange-yellow, while the under surface is yellow\r\nmarked with two bands of black. (_See plate, page 64._)\r\n\r\nThe Giant Swallowtail is a tropical species which is abundant\r\nthroughout the Southern states and during recent years seems to have\r\nbeen gradually extending its northern range. It is now commonly found\r\nas far north as forty-two degrees latitude, from Nebraska eastward. In\r\nNew England it is occasionally taken in Connecticut, Massachusetts,\r\nand even in Maine, but its appearance in this region is exceptional.\r\n\r\nIn the orange-growing regions of the Southern states the caterpillars\r\nof this butterfly feed freely upon the leaves of citrus fruits and\r\nthey are often called \"orange puppies\" or \"orange dogs.\" Probably\r\ntheir curious appearance and their habit of resting for long periods\r\nupon leaf or twig gave rise to this name. In the region indicated the\r\nlife-history of the insect may be summarized thus:\r\n\r\nThe mother butterfly deposits the eggs singly upon the young growth of\r\norange or other citrus fruit trees, generally near the tips of leaves\r\nor branches. About a week later each egg hatches into a caterpillar\r\nthat feeds upon the young leaves, resting upon the lower surface when\r\nnot eating. After a few days of this feeding the caterpillar becomes\r\ntoo large for the skin with which it was born and it moults, coming\r\nforth with a new skin which soon hardens so that it can begin feeding\r\nagain. A week or so later it moults for the second time, and continues\r\nthese processes of feeding and moulting until full grown, which is\r\nperhaps a month from the time of hatching from the egg. At first the\r\ncaterpillars eat only the succulent young leaves and branches, but as\r\nthey grow larger they feed more freely upon the older foliage. They\r\nare very voracious and when abundant may often do much damage\r\nespecially to young trees. When ready to change to the chrysalis each\r\ncaterpillar attaches itself by silken threads to the bark of the\r\ntrunk or branch of the tree. Here it changes to a chrysalis which\r\ntakes on a color so similar to that of the bark that the insect is\r\nsurprisingly difficult to discover. A fortnight or so later it changes\r\nagain into a fully developed butterfly that sallies forth in search of\r\nthe nectar of flowers. (_See plate, page 240._)\r\n\r\nThese \"orange dogs,\" like the caterpillars of other Swallowtail\r\nbutterflies, have curious yellow scent organs which, when the\r\ncaterpillar is disturbed, protrude from the upper surface just behind\r\nthe head. These give forth a very disagreeable odor which is believed\r\nto serve the purpose of repelling birds and possibly other enemies. It\r\nhas been noticed that these caterpillars are not molested by birds\r\nalthough they are attacked by various insect enemies. Each mother\r\nbutterfly is known to be able to deposit four or five hundred eggs and\r\nit has been suggested that the injuries of the caterpillars may be\r\nchecked by shooting the butterfly upon the wing with cartridges loaded\r\nwith small bird shot. In the South there are several broods in a\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe life-history of this species in more northern regions differs in\r\nthe choice of the food plant and the number of broods. It feeds upon\r\nvarious members of the rue family, including common rue and prickly\r\nash, as well as upon certain poplars and probably other trees. It is\r\ntwo brooded and apparently winters as a chrysalis. The butterflies of\r\nthe first brood come from the chrysalis about the last of May and are\r\nfound on the wing during June. Those of the second brood come from the\r\nchrysalis about the last of July and are found on the wing during\r\nAugust and September. The length of time required from the laying of\r\nthe egg to the emergence of the butterfly varies greatly with the\r\nlocality and the temperature. It commonly extends over a period of\r\nfour or five weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by Mary E. Walker_   _See page 62_\r\n\r\n     GIANT SWALLOWTAILS\r\n       Visiting blossoming branches of the orange tree.

The sheen\r\nof metallic color upon its wings is certainly suggestive of the broad\r\nexpanse of similar colorings in the gorgeous butterflies from South\r\nAmerica. This species is easily recognized by the general blackness of\r\nthe front wings and the basal parts of the hind ones as seen from\r\nabove, about two thirds of the area of the latter being overlaid with\r\nblue-green scales that give the metallic lustre characteristic of the\r\nspecies. Near the outer border of the basal half of the front wings\r\nthere is a row of about five rather indistinct whitish spots, this row\r\nbeing continued more distinctly on the hind wings. On the under\r\nsurface the white spots of the front wings are more pronounced than on\r\nthe upper, while each hind wing is brilliantly marked with about seven\r\nlarge orange spots, part of them fringed on one or both sides with a\r\ndistinct margin of white. The extreme side borders of all four wings\r\nare distinctly marked with white crescents and the fringes on the\r\ntails as well as more or less of the darker fringes of the hind wings\r\nare of a beautiful purple color. In the males each hind wing has along\r\nthe inner border a slender, pocket-like depression which is said to be\r\nthe seat of the scent organs. (_See plate, page 65._)\r\n\r\nThis splendid butterfly is a southern species. It is found from the\r\nCarolinas to California, being at times extremely abundant in certain\r\nlocalities over this great region. It seldom occurs as far north as\r\nNew England and in a general way east of the Rocky Mountains its\r\nnorthern limit approximates that of forty-three degrees of latitude.\r\nIt varies considerably in size and differs greatly in abundance in\r\ndifferent localities and different seasons.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Caterpillar of the Blue Swallowtail.\r\n     (After Riley)]\r\n\r\nProbably the commonest food plant of the caterpillars is the\r\nDutchman's Pipe or Aristolochia, which is frequently planted as an\r\nornamental vine for porch adornment. It also feeds upon wild ginger or\r\nAsarum and probably upon other plants. A dozen or more eggs are laid\r\nupon a leaf by the mother butterfly, usually in a cluster or grouped\r\nnear together. They hatch a week or so later into small brownish\r\ncaterpillars which remain together for awhile in little groups that\r\nfeed side by side upon the leaf, beginning at the margin and working\r\ntoward the centre. As they become larger they feed more freely and\r\ngradually disperse so that each forages for himself. As they approach\r\nmaturity their appetites become voracious and their presence is often\r\nshown by the defoliated condition of the branches. They have back of\r\nthe head the osmateria or scent organs which are commonly found in\r\nthe other caterpillars of this genus, but the odor emitted by them is\r\nlikely to be less pronounced than usual.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: TWO OF THE SWALLOWTAILS\r\n     (Three fourths natural size)\r\n\r\n     The Palamedes (_see page 76_)\r\n     The Giant (_see page 62_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:                                      _See page 67_\r\n\r\n     THE GREEN-CLOUDED SWALLOWTAIL\r\n       Upper surface above; lower surface below]\r\n\r\nWhen full grown the caterpillars find such shelter as they may and\r\neach spins a bit of silken web and a silken loop which hold it while\r\nit changes to the chrysalis. This chrysalis is very likely to take on\r\nthe colors of the immediate surroundings and thus be rather difficult\r\nto see. If the egg was laid by one of the spring or early summer\r\nbutterflies, the chrysalis will soon change to a butterfly which will\r\nappear toward midsummer and which may lay eggs for another brood of\r\ncaterpillars. These caterpillars mature to chrysalids the same season\r\nand some of them are believed to change into butterflies in autumn,\r\nthese butterflies hibernating through the winter; while others are\r\nbelieved to remain unchanged through the winter and disclose the\r\nbutterfly the following spring. This is an exceptional condition for\r\nthe Swallowtails and it is worth while to make careful observations\r\nalong its northern limits to learn more definitely the facts as to the\r\nwinter condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Green-clouded Swallowtail=\r\n  _Papilio troilus_\r\n\r\nThis beautiful butterfly is essentially a southern species and is\r\nfound over a wide range of territory from the Mississippi River to the\r\nAtlantic Ocean. It occurs as far north as New Hampshire and Vermont\r\nand has even been reported from Alberta, Canada. It is easily\r\nrecognized by the blue-green clouding of the upper surface of the\r\nwings, the general color being velvety black with distinctive rows of\r\nyellow spots along the margins of the front wing. These spots are\r\npresent also on the hind wing where they are almost changed to blue\r\nbecause overlaid with a general cloudiness of this color. On the under\r\nsurface of the hind wings there are two rows of orange-brown spots,\r\nthe inner row being nearly crescent-shaped and the outer row oblong.\r\nIn the living insect the tail projections on the hind wings are\r\nusually twisted into a vertical plane at right angles to the plane of\r\nthe wings.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of this species feed upon the leaves of sassafras and\r\nspice bush. The distribution of the butterfly appears to be closely\r\nrelated to the distribution of these plants.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with so many of our Swallowtail butterflies, the\r\nGreen-clouded Swallowtail passes through the winter in the chrysalis\r\nstage. Late in spring the butterflies emerge and soon afterward lay\r\ntheir eggs singly upon the leaves of sassafras or spice bush. The eggs\r\nsoon hatch into lead-colored caterpillars, largely covered with spiny\r\nwarts. Each caterpillar cleverly makes a protecting nest by eating out\r\na narrow strip in the leaf which frees a flap along the margin that is\r\nturned back upon the leaf, making a case in which the larva lives. It\r\nspins a silken carpet on one side of the case and rests upon this\r\ncarpet when at home. During its feeding periods it goes outside and\r\neats the tissues of the other parts of the same leaf. It continues to\r\noccupy this first nest for a week or more by which time the rest of\r\nthe leaf is likely to be pretty well consumed.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the first moult and thus become larger and having\r\npractically eaten itself out of its first house and home the\r\ncaterpillar now crawls to a larger leaf where it proceeds to make a\r\nmore enduring structure. In this case it does not need to bite a\r\nchannel along one side of the midrib as it did before, but instead it\r\nbegins to spin silken threads transversely across the upper surface in\r\nsuch a way as to fold over the border of the leaf and make a tubular\r\nchamber in which it has plenty of room to move about. It uses this as\r\nits home for some time thereafter, wandering out at evening to feed\r\nupon neighboring leaves as its hunger necessitates. In this way it\r\ncontinues to feed and grow for a week or two. Then it finds it\r\nnecessary to construct still another home, which it does by bringing\r\ntogether the opposite sides of a leaf, taking care to have a door-like\r\nopening at the base of the blade next the leaf stalk. This third home\r\nserves it to the end of its larval existence. It goes in and out as\r\nnecessary, remaining concealed when it casts its skin and until the\r\nbody tissues harden afterward. Apparently it devours the cast skin and\r\nthrusts the hard covering of the head out of the nest. Consequently\r\nthese little homes are clean and sanitary and serve admirably their\r\nprotecting purpose.\r\n\r\nThe full-grown caterpillars have the curious appearance of those of\r\nthe other Swallowtails. The third ring behind the head is greatly\r\nswollen, making, with the rings directly in front of it, a\r\ncharacteristic picture suggesting a grotesque face with large eye-like\r\nspots at the top. The general color is green, darker above than below,\r\nand there are six rows of blue dots along the body. (_See plate,\r\npage 80._)\r\n\r\nWhen ready to change to the chrysalis, the caterpillars desert their\r\nleafy homes and on a twig or board or stone each spins a bit of silken\r\nwebbing and a silken loop. They now change to chrysalids which are\r\nlikely to resemble the color of the background and which are somewhat\r\nsmoother than many of the Swallowtail chrysalids. About two weeks\r\nlater the butterflies emerge.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Eclosion of the Butterfly_\r\n\r\nThe transformation of a chrysalis into a butterfly is always one of\r\nextraordinary interest. Comparatively few definite descriptions of\r\nthis process have been given by careful observers. One of the best of\r\nthese is that written by Mr. Scudder in connection with the emergence\r\nof this butterfly, and it is so accurate and complete that it seems\r\nworth while to quote it at length:\r\n\r\n\"The butterfly generally emerges from the chrysalis early in the day,\"\r\nwrites Mr. Scudder, \"and the first signs of the immediate change are\r\nstrong forward and backward movements of the chrysalis at intervals of\r\na few seconds; perhaps the third or fourth attempt will be successful,\r\nwhen a click may be heard at the distance of several feet; but all the\r\nsubsequent movements are absolutely noiseless, though rapid; at\r\nintervals of three or four seconds, spasmodic movements similar to the\r\nfirst carry on the process; first the split continues along the\r\nthorax; then it runs down either side between the legs and wings,\r\nultimately to the tips of the antennae. As this progresses, the\r\nactions become more strenuous and more frequently repeated; with eager\r\nefforts the butterfly pushes forward its half-detached head; now an\r\nantenna springs from its case, at once assuming its natural attitude;\r\nthe other soon follows, and then the wings are partially drawn from\r\ntheir sheaths, and while in this position seem to be used as levers or\r\narms to aid in withdrawing the rest of the body; next the legs appear,\r\nseize the upper part of the chrysalis skin, and speedily withdraw the\r\nwhole body. It is now a curious-looking object, the wings wrinkled\r\nand bloated, and, although the whole process of escape lasts little\r\nmore than half a minute, already twice the size of the sheaths they\r\nlately occupied. The insect crawls upward until it finds a secure\r\nresting place, and there remains until ready for flight; each half of\r\nthe tongue, drawn independently from its receptacle, is rolled in a\r\nseparate spiral, and now while the wings are gradually expanding the\r\ninsect applies all its energies to uniting their two parts,\r\nincessantly rolls and unrolls them, and beginning simultaneously at\r\nthe base, gradually fits them together by their interlocking joints;\r\nin about fifteen minutes all but the tips are perfectly united; these\r\nrequire nearly fifteen minutes more, and are not fairly interlocked\r\nuntil the wings are fully expanded, nearly a full half hour after the\r\nescape from the chrysalis; the wings, however, are still tender, and\r\ngenerally require two hours to stiffen. When at last the insect\r\nventures upon flight, it is not with an uncertain flutter, but boldly\r\nand steadily, as if long accustomed to the action.\"\r\n\r\nThe butterflies of this second brood of the season are likely to begin\r\nto appear early in August, continuing to become more abundant\r\nthroughout that month. These lay eggs upon the same food plant and the\r\ncaterpillars grow to maturity in the same way as those of the first\r\nbrood. They become full grown during September or October, and then\r\nchange to chrysalids which remain dormant until the following spring.\r\nThe species thus has two broods each year and passes the winter only\r\nin the chrysalis state.\r\n\r\nThese beautiful butterflies are likely to be found in the sort of\r\nsituations where the food plants of the larvae are growing. Open\r\ngroves, the borders of woods, and the margins of streams or marshes\r\nare the places where one is most likely to find spice bush and\r\nsassafras. These are the places to look for these butterflies which\r\none may often see in graceful flight near the ground, pausing now and\r\nthen to seek a sassafras leaf or to sip the nectar from a flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Tiger Swallowtail=\r\n  _Papilio glaucus_\r\n\r\nOne of the many things that make a study of the life-histories of\r\nbutterflies of great interest is the variations in the development of\r\nmany of the species. One who follows the simplest life-story of a\r\nbutterfly and sees the egg change to larva and the larva change in\r\nsize and form and color with each successive moult and then change\r\nagain into the seemingly inert chrysalis, from which there finally\r\ncomes the winged butterfly--unlike the egg, unlike the larva, unlike\r\nthe chrysalis--a creature of perfect beauty, wonderfully adapted to\r\nliving freely in the air and sipping ambrosial nectar from the\r\nflowers--one who follows these changes with awakened vision can\r\nscarcely fail to have a sense of wonder as to the laws that govern\r\nsuch intricate phenomena. But the marvel is still more pronounced in\r\nthe case of those butterflies which have two or more forms arising\r\nfrom the same lot of eggs in a way which science has as yet not\r\nadequately explained.\r\n\r\nThe splendid Tiger Swallowtail is an example of this dimorphism which\r\nis of especial interest because of the fact that the extra form is\r\nconfined to one sex and to only a part of the geographical area over\r\nwhich the butterfly is found. The species occurs over a very large\r\npart of the North American continent, being found from ocean to ocean\r\nand from Canada to Florida. In the region north of approximately the\r\nfortieth degree of latitude there is but one form of the insect--the\r\nfamiliar yellow-and-black striped butterfly which every one has seen\r\nvisiting the lilac blossoms in May or June. South of this, however,\r\npart of the females take on an entirely different appearance, being\r\nalmost wholly black with the hind wings touched with lines of blue and\r\nbordered with crescents of yellow and orange. The curious thing about\r\nit is that a certain mother butterfly may lay a dozen eggs part of\r\nwhich will develop into the usual yellow form and the rest into the\r\nblack form, both lots being of the same sex. This black form is so\r\nentirely distinct in appearance that the two were originally described\r\nas separate species, and they were long considered such, until\r\nbreeding experiments determined the precise condition. (_See plate,\r\npage 17._)\r\n\r\nThis species is of interest also for another reason. The caterpillars\r\nduring their later life are remarkable examples of that curious\r\nresemblance to the head of a serpent which is thought to have a real\r\nprotective value in frightening away attacking birds and possibly\r\nother enemies. The rings of the body just back of the head are much\r\nswollen and on the top of the swollen part there are two large\r\ncircular marks which bear a striking resemblance to eyes. When the\r\ninsect is at rest it withdraws its head and holds up the front of the\r\nbody in such a way as certainly to suggest at the first glance that\r\none is looking at the head of a small snake, an impression which is\r\nlikely to be enhanced when the caterpillar pushes out the curious\r\nyellow scent organs from the ring near the top of the head, these\r\norgans taking on the forked appearance of a snake's tongue.\r\n\r\nObviously it is exceedingly difficult to get definite observations\r\nunder natural conditions to determine whether these seeming\r\nresemblances are really of value to the caterpillar in frightening\r\naway birds or other enemies. About the only direct evidence which I\r\nhave come across upon this point is found in this paragraph by Dr. J.\r\nL. Hancock:\r\n\r\n\"When I recall the first sight of this larva, the impression gained of\r\nit was a most curious one. The forward mask-like face was remarkably\r\nstartling. This mask, bearing eye-like spots and the light transverse\r\nridge, gave it an aspect which might easily be mistaken for real eyes\r\nand a mouth. This contrivance is only a false face in no way connected\r\nwith the real eyes and mouth. One might imagine the shock that a bird,\r\nor other predaceous enemy, would experience when looking upon this\r\ngrinning mask. This is in reality the effect produced, for I have seen\r\nsmall birds so alarmed that they lost their appetite and curiosity for\r\nthese larvae after a brief glance at them. It is certain that these\r\nsingular markings have the effect of terrifying their bird\r\nenemies.\"[B]\r\n\r\n   [B] \"Nature Sketches in Temperate America,\" p. 146.\r\n\r\nThe yearly cycle of the Tiger Swallowtail is much like that of the\r\nrelated species. It passes the winter as a chrysalis, the butterflies\r\ncoming forth just about the time that the lilacs bloom. They remain\r\nupon the wing for a few weeks and deposit their eggs upon a great\r\nvariety of trees and shrubs, for the food plants of the larvae are\r\nunusually varied and include tulip trees, birches, wild cherries,\r\napples, poplars, ash, and several other common trees or shrubs. These\r\neggs soon hatch into caterpillars that feed upon the leaves and make\r\nfor themselves resting places by spinning a web of silk transversely\r\nacross the surface of the leaf. They remain upon these silken webs\r\nwhen not feeding and in later life are likely to cause the leaf on\r\nwhich the web is made to curl into a partial tube. When fully\r\ndeveloped they change to chrysalids which give forth the summer brood\r\nof butterflies in July and August. These in turn lay eggs for the\r\ncaterpillars which change to chrysalids in autumn and remain in that\r\ncondition until the following spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Short-tailed Papilio=\r\n  _Papilio brevicauda_\r\n\r\nWere one enough of a magician to make one butterfly over into another\r\nit would be comparatively easy to take a Black Swallowtail and\r\ntransform it into this species. One would only need to trim off the\r\nlong tails so that they project very slightly from the angles of the\r\nhind wings and to change the yellow spots to orange. He would thus\r\naccomplish what Nature through the long ages seems to have\r\naccomplished in a limited northern area in Newfoundland and around the\r\nGulf of St. Lawrence, for the Short-tailed Papilio is confined chiefly\r\nto this region, where it lives a life very similar to that of the\r\nBlack Swallowtail. The caterpillar feeds upon the leaves of various\r\nmembers of the parsley family and is said to have learned to warm\r\nitself during the middle of the day by resting upon stones and gravel\r\nwhich have absorbed the sun's heat rays. Presumably there is but one\r\nbrood a year and the insect hibernates as a chrysalis.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Palamedes Swallowtail=\r\n  _Papilio palamedes_\r\n\r\nIf the magician who had succeeded in converting a Black Swallowtail\r\ninto the Short-tailed Papilio wished to try his hand on making a\r\nPalamedes Swallowtail he could not do better than to use again the\r\nsame black butterfly. He would only need to make it about one half\r\nlarger, retaining practically all its color markings and the outline\r\nof its wings and tail. For this species bears a remarkable resemblance\r\nto the Black Swallowtail, seeming to be a giant variety induced by the\r\nwarmth of the southern climate where it lives, and possibly by the\r\nmore generous supply of the magnolia and sassafras leaves upon which\r\nthe caterpillars feed.\r\n\r\nThis species is distinctly a southern form occurring as far west as\r\nthe Mississippi River throughout the more Southern states. As one\r\nwould expect in the long seasons and warm climate of this region there\r\nare several broods each year and the caterpillars often hibernate as\r\nwell as the chrysalids. The adult butterflies are lovers of the sun\r\nand are said to roost at night upon the tops of live oak and palmetto\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Zebra Swallowtail=\r\n  _Iphiclides ajax_\r\n\r\nMost of our Swallowtail butterflies are so distinctive in form and\r\ncolors that they are easily distinguished from one another, but the\r\nZebra species is so different from all the rest that when it is once\r\nseen it is likely always to be remembered. The striking combination of\r\ngreen and black stripes with very long tails, set off by beautiful\r\ncrescents of blue and of red, at once distinguishes this fine\r\nbutterfly in any of its varying forms.\r\n\r\nThree distinct forms of this species occur, namely:\r\n\r\n_Marcellus_, the early spring form, small in size with short tails,\r\nthat show white only on the tips;\r\n\r\n_Telamonides_, the late spring form, somewhat larger, with tails a\r\nlittle longer and showing more white on the outer half;\r\n\r\n_Ajax_, the summer form, decidedly larger with tails very long.\r\n\r\nIt would be a comparatively simple matter to understand these forms if\r\nthey were simply seasonal variations, with three broods, each form\r\nsucceeding the other as the season advances. But this is far from\r\nbeing the case. We have instead the most complicated and confusing\r\nseries of conditions imaginable--conditions for which no one has yet\r\ngiven satisfactory explanations.\r\n\r\nTo make a fairly clear statement of what happens, suppose we assume\r\nthat we start with twenty over-wintering chrysalids. In April ten of\r\nthese disclose their butterflies which are Marcellus, the early spring\r\nform. In May the other ten disclose their butterflies which are\r\nTelamonides, the late spring form. We thus have these two forms,\r\nappearing successively in spring from the same set of over-wintering\r\nchrysalids.\r\n\r\nAfter flying about for a short time the Marcellus or early spring\r\nSwallowtails lay eggs upon the leaves of papaw trees or bushes. These\r\neggs soon hatch into caterpillars that feed upon the leaves and grow\r\nrather rapidly. A little more than a month later they mature into\r\nbutterflies which are Ajax, the summer form.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way the Telamonides or late spring butterflies lay eggs\r\nsoon after they appear, also upon papaw leaves, and these eggs in\r\nabout a month mature into Ajax, the summer form.\r\n\r\nSo we have Ajax, the summer form, developing directly from both the\r\nearly spring or Marcellus and the late spring or Telamonides\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\nThese Ajax butterflies in their turn lay eggs for caterpillar young.\r\nThese soon mature into a brood of butterflies which are of this same\r\nAjax form. There may be successive broods through the summer,\r\npractically all of them being this same Ajax summer form.\r\n\r\nThe last brood of caterpillars, however, change to chrysalids which do\r\nnot disclose the butterflies until the following spring. And then the\r\nfirst that come out are the Marcellus form and the last the\r\nTelamonides form. So we may have these two forms maturing from the\r\nsame brood of autumn caterpillars.\r\n\r\nThis seems a sufficiently complicated life-history to suit the most\r\npersistent solver of puzzle problems, but there is an additional\r\nfactor which adds much to the possible confusion of the broods. In\r\neach brood of caterpillars from the earliest to the latest there are a\r\ncertain number of chrysalids which remain dormant through the\r\nremainder of the season and the following winter, maturing into\r\nbutterflies the next spring. Consequently at the end of every winter\r\nthere are a miscellaneous lot of chrysalids which represent every\r\nbrood of caterpillars that lived the previous season, and all of these\r\ndevelop into either Marcellus or Telamonides butterflies.\r\n\r\nSuch a condition of affairs certainly represents what an old New\r\nEnglander would be likely to call a \"mixed-up mess,\" and it is\r\ndifficult for science to find rhyme or reason to explain it. It speaks\r\neloquently for the perseverance of W. H. Edwards that he was able with\r\ninfinite patience through years of study and experiment to untangle\r\nthis intricate web of butterfly existence.\r\n\r\nWhile the preferred food plant of this species is papaw, the\r\ncaterpillars are also known to feed upon the spice bush and upland\r\nhuckleberry. When full grown these caterpillars are about two inches\r\nlong and of a general pea-green color, banded transversely with yellow\r\nand black, and having an especially conspicuous band of this sort on\r\nthe third ring behind the head. The scent organs are protruded when\r\nthe larva is disturbed and emit an offensive odor. The chrysalids are\r\ngreen or brown according to the surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe Zebra Swallowtail is a southern butterfly found as far west as\r\nTexas and the Rocky Mountains and having its northern limits in a zone\r\nranging approximately from Massachusetts to Nebraska. It is especially\r\nabundant in the Southern states east of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nMr. S. F. Denton found this species abundant in southern Ohio where\r\nthe females laid their eggs upon the small papaw bushes. They selected\r\nthe leaves of these bushes for sleeping quarters, \"clinging to the\r\nunder side of the leaves where early in the morning they might be\r\ntaken with the fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Swallowtails_\r\n\r\nSeveral other Swallowtail butterflies are found within the limits of\r\nthe United States, especially in the Far West and along the southern\r\nboundaries. Some of these occasionally migrate east or north so that\r\nthey are collected in the Central states. Thus _Papilio daunus_, _P.\r\noregonia_, and _P. zolicoan_ are all found in the \"List of Nebraska\r\nButterflies,\" published by Mr. H. G. Barber, and the same species have\r\nbeen taken in other states in or near the Mississippi Valley. These\r\nand various others are described and pictured in Dr. Holland's\r\nexcellent \"Butterfly Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Swallowtails_\r\n\r\n_Tiger Swallowtail_: _Yellow form_ (_Papilio glaucus turnus_).

Much like the Black Swallowtail but considerably larger. A\r\ncurved yellow line on the head back of each eye. Found only in the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITES, ORANGE-TIPS, AND YELLOWS\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Pieridae_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most familiar and abundant American butterflies are classified\r\ntogether under the family name _Pieridae_, or the Pierids. Three\r\ngroups or tribes of them are popularly known as the Whites, the\r\nOrange-tips, and the Yellows. Our two commonest butterflies, the White\r\nor Imported Cabbage Butterfly and the Sulphur Yellow Butterfly, are\r\ntypical representatives of this family. Most of the rest, like these,\r\nare of moderate size with rounded wings which are more or less marked\r\nwith black. There are six well-developed legs and the caterpillars of\r\npractically all the species are cylindrical greenish worms which under\r\na lens are seen to be covered with short hairs. When the caterpillars\r\nare ready to change to chrysalids they spin a web of silk upon the\r\nsupporting surface and just back of it, a loop of silk that serves to\r\nhold the chrysalis in place and keep it from swaying back and forth.\r\nThe chrysalids are characterized by having a pointed projection on the\r\nfront of the head, the rest of the body being more or less angular.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their close general resemblance to their food plants,\r\nthe caterpillars of this family suffer from attack by various enemies.\r\nBirds find many of them, not only eating them themselves but also\r\nusing them freely for feeding the nestlings. Parasitic insects also\r\ntake a heavy toll from these caterpillars. This attack of enemies is\r\ndoubtless a chief reason why many of the common species are not much\r\nmore destructive.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE WHITES\r\n\r\nThree white butterflies of approximately the same size are found\r\nwidely distributed over the United States. The most abundant species\r\nis the White or Imported Cabbage butterfly. The next in abundance is\r\nprobably the Checkered White, and the rarest in most localities is the\r\nGray-veined White which is a northern form.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The White or Imported Cabbage Butterfly=\r\n  _Pieris rapae_\r\n\r\nThere is probably no butterfly which one can generally find so easily\r\nin its early stages as the White or Imported Cabbage butterfly which\r\nis found practically wherever cabbages are grown and is generally so\r\nabundant that caterpillars and chrysalids are readily discovered. In\r\nthe Northern states the insect passes through the winter within the\r\nchrysalis, coming forth rather early in spring as the familiar white\r\nbutterfly with black dots upon the wings and blackish front angles of\r\nthe fore wings. (_See plates, pages 64-65 and 81._)\r\n\r\nThe butterflies that thus appear in spring flit freely about over\r\nfields, meadows, and gardens, sipping the nectar of various early\r\nflowers through their long, coiled tongues and stopping occasionally\r\nto alight upon the leaf of a cabbage or other plant of the mustard\r\nfamily to deposit the small, pale yellow eggs which remain attached by\r\na sort of glue. The adult butterflies continue their leisurely life\r\nfor a fortnight or more, thus extending the laying of the eggs over a\r\nconsiderable period.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after being deposited the egg hatches into a tiny green\r\ncaterpillar that begins feeding upon the tender surface of the cabbage\r\nleaf. It is commonly called the cabbage worm and it is doubtless the\r\nmost generally destructive insect affecting this crop. It continues to\r\nfeed for several days before the first moult, after which it becomes\r\ndecidedly larger and begins to eat again more voraciously than before.\r\nIt undergoes several successive moults during the next two or three\r\nweeks before it becomes full grown as a caterpillar. Unlike most\r\nbutterfly larvae it has changed very little in its general appearance\r\nduring its growth. It is always of a pale green color, strikingly like\r\nthe glaucous green of the cabbage leaf, a fact which doubtless helps\r\nto conceal it from the eager eyes of birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar is thus full fed it is likely to leave its food\r\nplant and find shelter elsewhere. Sometimes it will stop on the lower\r\nsurface of the outer leaves, but more commonly it will find a piece of\r\nboard, an overhanging stone, a fence-post, or the side of a building,\r\nwhere it will prepare for the change to the chrysalis. It will do this\r\nby spinning a silken thread upon the surface in which to entangle its\r\nhind legs and a loop of silk near by with which to hold its body. When\r\nthese preparations are completed the insect will cast its last\r\ncaterpillar skin, emerging as a grayish or brownish chrysalis, the\r\ncolor usually varying with the color of the surrounding surface.\r\n\r\nA week or more later the chrysalis skin bursts open and the white\r\nbutterfly emerges to expand and dry its wings before it flies away for\r\nits leisurely life. There are two or more broods each season, the\r\nnumber varying with the latitude. There is a decided variation in the\r\nlength of time required for the completion of the cycle from egg to\r\nbutterfly. In hot weather the insect may mature in about three weeks\r\nwhile in cooler weather it may require as much as five weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Its Introduction and Dispersal_\r\n\r\nWhile it is well known that a large proportion of our most destructive\r\ninsects have been imported from Europe, it is only in comparatively\r\nfew cases that man has been able to make careful records of the times\r\nand places where the insects were introduced and to follow the spread\r\nof the pest from these original centres. The Imported Cabbage\r\nbutterfly is one of the few species of which this is true. This insect\r\nhas been known for centuries in Europe, where it feeds freely upon the\r\nleaves of cabbages and turnips. So far as known it was first\r\nintroduced into North America about 1860, when it appeared in Quebec.\r\nEight years later it was again introduced into the region of New York\r\nCity. From these two points the insect spread gradually in various\r\ndirections until in 1871 it covered the whole of New England and\r\nvarious parts of New York and New Jersey. From then on it spread even\r\nmore rapidly and was evidently accidentally introduced into various\r\nparts of the country which became new centres of distribution. Of\r\ncourse it would be very easy for this to happen through the shipment\r\nof cabbages from one part of the country to another. Within thirty\r\nyears of the time of its first introduction it had become a serious\r\npest over practically all the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nThe introduction and spread of such a pest is of interest in itself,\r\nbut in this case there is to be noted the additional fact that the\r\npresence of this foreigner has practically led to the extinction of\r\ntwo native species of butterflies, both closely related to each other\r\nand to the invader and both feeding upon the same plants. An almost\r\npure white butterfly--the Gray-veined White--was formerly exceedingly\r\nabundant in many of the Northern states, while farther south there was\r\nanother species, the Checkered White, which was also abundant. Both of\r\nthese have now so completely disappeared that in some localities they\r\nare almost never seen, while their imported relative has become\r\nperhaps the most abundant of all American butterflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Gray-veined White=\r\n  _Pieris napi_\r\n\r\nOne would naturally suppose that when a butterfly was reduced to the\r\ngreatest possible simplicity in its coloring there would be little\r\nchance for the development of geographical or seasonal varieties. But\r\nhe would only have to study a large collection of specimens of this\r\nspecies, taken at different seasons and in different regions, to find\r\nhis supposition at fault. Here is a butterfly which is essentially a\r\nslender black-bodied creature with four white wings scarcely touched\r\nwith color, and yet we are told that there are eleven varieties in the\r\nUnited States so distinct that they have received scientific names,\r\nnot to mention various others which have been found in Europe. This\r\nis indeed a remarkable showing and it is a striking illustration of\r\nthe infinite variations which Nature can produce with the most limited\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nTo me the seasonal variations of a butterfly are always of greater\r\ninterest than those which are geographical. We know that in the case\r\nof a great many animals, from insects to mammals, the different\r\nconditions of climate and physical environment found in different\r\nregions produce variations of many sorts. So it does not seem\r\nespecially strange that in Alaska there should be a different form of\r\na certain butterfly than is found in Virginia. But that in the same\r\nlocality there should be two or more forms of a butterfly existing\r\nunder identical conditions as to climate and environment is not so\r\neasily explained. In the case of the Gray-veined White we collect in\r\nearly spring in New England, or other Northern states, a lot of\r\nchrysalids. We keep them until the butterflies come forth and we find\r\neven here two distinct forms, one smaller and more delicate than the\r\nother, with both surfaces of the wings pure white: scientists call\r\nthis form, _virginiensis_; the other larger with the under surface of\r\nthe wings slightly tinted with yellow: scientists call this form\r\n_oleracea_. The first named has but one brood a year while the second\r\nlays eggs which develop into caterpillars that produce butterflies of\r\nstill a _third_ form, in which the upper surface of the wings is pure\r\nwhite with a slightly greater expanse: scientists call this form\r\n_cruciferarum_. These three varieties occur in Eastern regions and may\r\nbe found in the same localities, and differ considerably from various\r\ngeographical varieties found in the Far West.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of the Gray-veined White is a bit smaller than those\r\nof the nearly related forms, and in color is green with no distinct\r\nlongitudinal markings, but with many fine dots of black over the\r\nsurface. The cylindrical body is covered with a fine down. When\r\nfeeding upon cabbage it is more likely to attack the outer than the\r\ninner leaves, and so even when abundant it is less troublesome to\r\ngardeners than the imported species. It is now, however, so rare that\r\nit seems to feed chiefly upon wild cruciferous plants and is more\r\nlikely to be found along the borders of open woods than in gardens and\r\nfields. The winter is passed in the chrysalis state.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Checkered White=\r\n  _Pontia protodice_\r\n\r\nSome years ago the Checkered White was commonly called the Southern\r\nCabbage Butterfly but the general distribution of the imported species\r\nhas had the same effect upon its abundance in the South that it has\r\nhad upon the Gray-veined White in the North. Consequently, it is now\r\nmuch less abundant than formerly, even in the Southern states where it\r\nis most at home. There are two fairly distinct forms: the spring form\r\nand the summer form. The latter is practically of the same size as the\r\nImported Cabbage Butterfly: the males have the hind wings nearly white\r\nabove and the fore wings with a few black dots or spots upon their\r\nouter halves. The females are much more definitely marked, having the\r\nupper surface of both pairs of wings marked in black or brownish black\r\nin such a way as to enclose a large number of white diamonds. The\r\nspring form is decidedly smaller and the markings are much less\r\ndistinct than in the summer form.\r\n\r\nThe seasonal history of this species is comparatively simple. In\r\nwinter the chrysalids are found. From these chrysalids in early spring\r\nthe small butterflies of the spring form come forth. These lay eggs\r\nupon various cruciferous plants which hatch into greenish caterpillars\r\nthat eat the leaves and soon mature so far as their caterpillar stage\r\nis concerned. They are then about an inch long, with downy cylindric\r\nbodies more or less marked with rather pale yellow stripes, touched\r\nhere and there with purplish green or dotted slightly with fine black\r\ndots. These caterpillars now attach themselves by means of a button of\r\nsilk and a silken loop to some support like a piece of board, the side\r\nof a stone, or almost any available shelter. Each casts its larval\r\nskin and appears as a grayish chrysalis from which probably a\r\nfortnight later the summer form of the butterfly emerges. There are\r\ncommonly two broods of this summer form, making three sets of\r\nbutterflies for the entire season. The caterpillars of the second\r\nsummer brood of butterflies go into the chrysalis stage in autumn to\r\nremain throughout the winter.\r\n\r\nSome very interesting observations upon the sleeping habits of this\r\nbutterfly have been made in St. Louis by Mr. and Mrs. Phil Rau. The\r\ninsects were found abundantly resting upon the seed heads of white\r\nsnakeroot. Early in October, when a warm south wind was blowing, the\r\ngreat majority of the butterflies slept horizontally with their heads\r\ntoward the wind. At other seasons and in other places, many of them\r\nwere found in a vertical position but practically all had their bodies\r\ntoward the wind prevailing at the time. The observers were unable to\r\nascertain definitely whether the insects thus oriented themselves at\r\nthe time of alighting, so that their wings presented the least\r\nresistance to the force of the wind, or whether this was a mechanical\r\nresult of the breezes.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Great Southern White=\r\n  _Pontia monuste_\r\n\r\nThere used to be in the Northern states before the advent of the\r\nImported Cabbage butterfly a familiar white butterfly which then laid\r\nits eggs upon cabbages in much the same way that the imported pest now\r\ndoes. One who has seen this northern Gray-veined White and then sees\r\nthe Great Southern White will be likely to think of the latter as a\r\nlarger edition of the former, for in the males of the southern species\r\nthe wings are practically white save for a narrow dusky border at the\r\nouter angle of the front pair, although in the female this dusky\r\nmargin is wider and the hind wings show a series of dusky triangles\r\nnear the margin. There is also a curious black marking suggestive of a\r\ncrescent on each front wing near the middle of the front border, which\r\nhelps to make the appearance of this butterfly very distinct from that\r\nof any other.\r\n\r\nAlthough this species is at times so abundant that it swarms in great\r\nflocks and although it has been known for many years, its life-history\r\nseems not to have been carefully worked out since it was first\r\ndescribed by Abbott more than a century ago. The caterpillars feed\r\nupon cruciferous plants and when full grown are about an inch and a\r\nhalf long, of a general yellow color, more or less striped with\r\npurple lines. The species is distinctly tropical extending northward\r\ninto our Southern states.\r\n\r\nDr. G. B. Longstaff reports this species as abundant in Jamaica where\r\nhe found that the clubs of the antennae of the living insects showed a\r\nbeautiful turquoise blue color, although another observer described\r\nthem as bright green with a tinge of blue. This is an interesting\r\ncolor variation for a member of this group. In the tropics also there\r\nare two forms, one belonging to the dry season and one to the wet\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Whites_\r\n\r\n_Imported Cabbage Butterfly_ (_Pieris rapae_). Expanse 2 inches. Upper\r\nsurface white with a black marginal dash on the front outer angle of\r\nthe front wing. One round black spot on each of the four wings in the\r\nmale. Two round spots on each of the front wings in the female and one\r\nround spot on each of the hind wings. Under surface of hind wings\r\nyellowish white; spots on front wings in same position as on upper\r\nsurface. A spring form (_immaculata_) is smaller and the black spots\r\nare almost obsolete.\r\n\r\n_Gray-veined White_ (_Pieris napi_). Expanse 2 inches. Upper surface\r\nwhite with only a darker marginal splash next the body. Under surface\r\nwhite with gray veins.\r\n\r\n_Checkered White_ (_Pontia protodice_ or _Pieris protodice_). Expanse\r\n2 inches. Upper surface white, strongly marked especially in the\r\nfemale with dark grayish brown on both pairs of wings. Along the outer\r\nmargins these marks are so arranged as to enclose white diamond spots.\r\nMale with front wings only lightly marked and hind wings scarcely\r\nmarked at all. Under surface much like upper, with a slight yellowish\r\ntinge in female.\r\n\r\n_Great Southern White_ (_Pontia monuste_ or _Pieris phileta_.) Expanse\r\n2 1/2 inches. General color white with a narrow black margin around\r\napical angle of front wings. These margins are wider in the female, in\r\nwhich sex there is a series of marginal spots on the hind wings.\r\nEasily known by its large size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE ORANGE-TIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen one sees a gossamer-winged butterfly flitting from flower to\r\nflower on a bright June day it seems one of the most ethereal of\r\nearth's visions. One could readily fancy that the whole\r\nsight--flowers, butterflies, and all--might easily vanish into thin\r\nair. So it is something of a shock to hear scientists talk about\r\nfossil butterflies and to realize that these fragile creatures have\r\nbeen living generation after generation for untold millions of years.\r\nA realization of this fact, however, helps us to understand the many\r\nwonderful ways in which butterflies in all stages of their existence\r\nhave become adapted to the conditions of their lives.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no group of butterflies whose beauty seems more\r\nfragile than that of the Orange-tips. These are delicate creatures,\r\nwith slender bodies and almost gauzy wings, of a size somewhat smaller\r\nthan our common white and yellow butterflies. Perhaps the most\r\nremarkable feature is the marking of the wings, the upper sides of the\r\nfront pair having an orange patch near the apex and the under sides\r\nhaving a background of delicate whitish or yellowish green, lined and\r\nspotted with darker coloring in a very characteristic way. This\r\npeculiar marking is so significant that it has been called \"flower\r\npicturing.\" To understand the reason for its existence one has only to\r\nwatch the butterflies in their native haunts. He will find them\r\nflitting from blossom to blossom among the plants of the mustard\r\nfamily--the _Cruciferae_. This is one of the most characteristic\r\nfamilies in the plant world: the foliage for the most part is small\r\nand delicate and the flowers have a characteristic four-petaled\r\nstructure, being practically always of small size and generally toned\r\nin whites or yellows. When an Orange-tip is at rest upon these\r\nblossoms it merges so completely into the background that it\r\ndisappears from view. Should a bird chase one of these insects through\r\nthe air it would see chiefly the orange tips which are so marked upon\r\nthe upper side of the wing, and when the butterfly closed its wings\r\nand lighted among the flowers the orange color would instantly\r\ndisappear and there would be only an almost invisible surface against\r\nthe background of flower and leaf.\r\n\r\nThe adaptations of these Orange-tips to the conditions of their lives\r\nare by no means confined to this remarkable resemblance to the flowery\r\nbackground. In the case of some species the whole yearly cycle has\r\nbeen adapted to correspond to the yearly history of the cruciferous\r\nfood plant. As is well known many species of the mustard family spring\r\nup early in the season, put forth their blossoms which quickly develop\r\ninto fruits and then die down, the species being carried through until\r\nthe next year by the dormant seeds. In a similar way the Orange-tips\r\nfeed as caterpillars upon the host plant through the spring,\r\ncompleting their growth before the plant dies and then changing to\r\nchrysalids which remain dormant through summer, fall, and winter and\r\ncome forth as butterflies early the following spring. The insect has\r\nthus adapted itself in a most remarkable manner to the yearly history\r\nof its plant host.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Falcate Orange-tip=\r\n  _Synchloe genutia_\r\n\r\nThe Falcate Orange-tip is about the only member of this tribe\r\ngenerally distributed east of the Rocky Mountains. This is a beautiful\r\ninsect which is sparingly found even as far north as New England. It\r\nis more abundant throughout the Southern states, occurring south at\r\nleast as far as Texas. It appears to be a good illustration of the\r\nadaptation of its development to that of its food plants. The eggs are\r\nlaid upon leaves or stems of such spring-flowering _Cruciferae_ as\r\nrock cress (_Arabis_), and hedge mustard (_Sisymbrium_). On hatching\r\nthe caterpillars feed upon stems, leaves, flowers, and even seed pods\r\nof these plants, becoming mature in a few weeks and changing to\r\nchrysalids under the protection of such shelter as they can find. In\r\nthe Northern states these chrysalids remain unchanged until the\r\nfollowing spring when the butterflies emerge and are found upon the\r\nwing for a few weeks in May and early June. In some southern regions\r\nat least the species is evidently double-brooded, as Dr. Holland\r\nreports that he has taken the butterflies in late autumn in the\r\nwestern portion of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Egg of _Synchloe genutia_, magnified 20\r\n     diameters. (From Holland)]\r\n\r\nThis Falcate Orange-tip is one of the daintiest and most exquisite of\r\nnorthern butterflies. It is a prize which any collector will find joy\r\nin possessing. It is easily recognized by its general white color,\r\nwhich in the female is relieved only by a distinct black mark on the\r\nupper surface of the front wings and a row of marginal markings upon\r\nall the wings. The male is slightly smaller and is at once known by\r\nthe orange blotch on the outer angle of the upper surface of the front\r\nwing. This outer angle projects into a distinct point which gives the\r\nspecies its name Falcate. (_See plate, page 256._)\r\n\r\nDr. J. L. Hancock has described in a most interesting manner the way\r\nin which this Orange-tip loses itself among the flowers of rock cress.\r\nIn northern Indiana he found this butterfly abundant in April at the\r\ntime of the blossoming of _Arabis lyrata_. The butterflies would be\r\nflying about, easily seen in the air. Then they would suddenly\r\ndisappear and could be found only after the most careful search. They\r\nhad simply lit upon the flower heads, when the flower picturing of the\r\nunder surface of the wings blended perfectly with the appearance of\r\nthe clustered flower.\r\n\r\n\"The green markings of the under side of the wing,\" writes Dr.\r\nHancock, \"are so arranged as to divide the ground color into patches\r\nof white, which blend with or simulate perfectly the petals of the\r\nclustered flowers. The eyes of the butterfly are delicate pale green\r\nand the antennae are whitish, all of which adds to the effectiveness\r\nof the blend. The flowers of _Arabis_ have white petals with the\r\ncentre yellowish green, as is also the calyx. There is a shade of pink\r\noutside the base of the petals. All in all, the adaptation of insect\r\nto flower here displayed is one of rare exquisiteness.\"[C]\r\n\r\n   [C] \"Nature Sketches in Temperate America\", p. 83.\r\n\r\nDr. Hancock found that the butterflies were able to cling on the\r\nflowers during strong winds very persistently, so that even when a\r\nstorm blew across the sand dunes they were likely to remain in\r\nposition. They also have the instinct to rest very quietly after they\r\nhave lit upon the clustered flower heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Olympian Orange-tip=\r\n  _Synchloe olympia_\r\n\r\nIn various parts of the Southern states there is at least one other\r\nOrange-tip butterfly which is found occasionally in connection with\r\nthe Falcate Orange-tip. It was named Olympia many years ago by William\r\nH. Edwards. It is a delicate white species marked with black and\r\nyellow very lightly both above and below, the yellow showing only on\r\nthe under side of the hind wings and that part of the front wing which\r\nis exposed when the insect is at rest. Strictly speaking, this is not\r\nan Orange-tip because the orange color is lacking in both sexes.\r\n\r\nThis is rather a rare species which occurs occasionally from the\r\nAtlantic states to the Great Plains south of a line drawn from\r\nnorthern Maryland to northern Missouri. Like its allies the larvae\r\nfeed upon various cruciferous plants, the hedge mustard being one of\r\nthese and the adults visit the flowers of the same family. They\r\ndoubtless have habits similar to those of the Falcate Orange-tip, and\r\nthe extreme delicacy of color must render them practically invisible\r\nwhen resting upon the small white flowers of most crucifers.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by Mary E. Walker_   _See page 72_\r\n\r\n     THE TIGER SWALLOWTAIL\r\n       (Reduced)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by W. I. Beecroft_   _See page 83_\r\n\r\n     THE IMPORTED CABBAGE BUTTERFLY\r\n       Caterpillar, chrysalis, and butterflies]\r\n\r\nMost of the Orange-tip butterflies are found on the Pacific Slope,\r\nranging from Alaska southward, several of them being especially\r\nabundant in the western mountain regions. About eight species are\r\nrecognized as belonging to our fauna, some of which have several\r\nwell-marked varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Orange-tips_\r\n\r\n_Falcate Orange-tip_ (_Synchloe genutia_, _Anthocaris genutia_ or\r\n_Euchloe genutia_). Expanse 1 2/5 inches. Tips of front wings\r\nprojecting in a hooked angle. Orange blotch on upper surface near tip\r\nin male, absent in female.\r\n\r\n_Olympian Orange-tip_ (_Synchloe olympia_, _Euchloe olympia_ or\r\n_Anthocaris olympia_). Expanse 1 1/2 inches. Wings white above in both\r\nsexes with greenish black markings at base of all wings and along\r\nfront margin of front wings, especially at apex. No orange patch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE YELLOWS\r\n\r\n\r\nA large proportion of our most abundant and conspicuous butterflies\r\nbelong to the Tribe of the Yellows. Sometimes it is called the Tribe\r\nof the Red-horns because the antennae of the living insects are so\r\noften red. These insects vary in size from the large Brimstones or\r\nCloudless Sulphurs, expanding three inches, to the delicate little\r\nDainty Sulphur, expanding scarcely an inch. The distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of the tribe are found in the very gradual enlargement\r\nof the joints of the antennae that form the club, and the stout palpi,\r\nthe last joints of each of the latter being short.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Brimstone or Cloudless Sulphur=\r\n  _Callidrayas eubule_\r\n\r\nPractically all northern butterflies are variously marked in different\r\ncolors, while the butterflies of tropical regions are commonly tinted\r\nin monotone, though often showing a splendid iridescence. One with\r\nvery little experience can tell the look of a tropical butterfly and\r\nwould be likely to say at once that the Cloudless Sulphur is one of\r\nthese. The upper surface of the wings of the male is a clear plain\r\nsulphur with merely the narrowest possible fringe of brown around the\r\nmargin made only by the colored marginal scales. The under surface is\r\nlighter and sparsely dotted in brown. In the females the marginal\r\nbrown takes on the shape of a series of small crescents and there is a\r\nsingle round brown eye-spot just in front of the middle of each front\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nWhile the Cloudless Sulphur is without doubt essentially a tropical\r\nspecies it has an extraordinary geographical range. It is extremely\r\nabundant in Mexico, Cuba, and the tropical zone in South America. It\r\nextends south even to northern Patagonia and north to New England,\r\nWisconsin, and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nPresumably in the tropics this species breeds continuously, one\r\ngeneration following another in regular succession unless interrupted\r\nby drought or other natural phenomena. In our Southern states there is\r\nmore or less interruption by the winter season, so that it is commonly\r\nconsidered to have only two broods, the butterflies hibernating.\r\nFarther north there is probably only one brood in summer, and perhaps\r\nnot even that in the extreme limit of its range. For there is pretty\r\ngood evidence that the specimens seen in the Northern states are\r\nmigrants from the south, coming singly or in scattered flocks in early\r\nsummer, and if they lay eggs the butterflies of the new generation\r\nreturn south in autumn. But the precise conditions are not well known\r\nand need careful observations in various localities.\r\n\r\nThe life-story of a generation of these butterflies is much like that\r\nof the other Yellows. The eggs are laid, one in a place, on the\r\nleaflets of various species of wild senna (_Cassia_) and soon hatch\r\ninto cylindrical caterpillars that devour the tender leaflets. In a\r\nfew weeks the caterpillars mature and change to curious and\r\ncharacteristic chrysalids. The head projects in the shape of a cone\r\nand the back is so concave as to give the side view of the chrysalis a\r\nvery striking appearance.\r\n\r\nLike so many of the Yellows this butterfly is sun-loving and social in\r\nits habits. Great numbers flock together, their large size and bright\r\ncoloring rendering them very conspicuous. They often alight on the\r\nground to sip moisture when they have been likened to beds of yellow\r\ncrocuses. They also fly long distances in flocks that attract much\r\nattention. It is likely that the northward distribution takes place in\r\nsummer through such migrating hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Sulphur Butterflies_\r\n\r\nThe Large Orange Sulphur is a closely related butterfly of about the\r\nsame size, in which the coloring is uniformly orange-yellow instead of\r\nlemon-yellow. It also belongs to the tropics, occurring in our extreme\r\nSouthern states and ranging occasionally as far north as Nebraska.\r\n\r\nThe Red-barred Sulphur is another splendid butterfly, somewhat larger\r\nthan the Brimstone, which is easily distinguished by the broad reddish\r\nbar across the upper surface of the front wings. It is tropical but\r\nmigrates rarely even as far north as Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Dog's-head Butterfly=\r\n  _Meganostoma caesonia_\r\n\r\nThe Dog's-head butterfly furnishes one of the most remarkable examples\r\nof accidental resemblance in wing markings that can be found in the\r\nwhole order of scale-winged insects. It is comparable with the skull\r\nand crossbones on the back of the death's-head moth. In the butterfly\r\nthe middle of the front wings has a broad band of yellow against a\r\nblack margin on each side and the yellow outlines make an excellent\r\nsilhouette of the profile of a poodle with a large black eye-spot in\r\nexactly the proper place. The females are less brightly colored than\r\nthe males but they still show the dog's-head silhouette.\r\n\r\nThis is a southern species, which occasionally strays as far north as\r\nNew York City, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Iowa. The larvae feed on\r\nspecies of Amorpha and are believed to be three-brooded in southern\r\nregions where the butterfly occurs.\r\n\r\nThe California Dog's-head is even more beautiful than the southern\r\nspecies. It is remarkable for its pink and purple iridescence--a\r\ncharacteristic which is not common in the butterflies of the Yellow\r\nand the White Tribes. The silhouette of the Dog's-head is less perfect\r\nthan in the more eastern species, and the yellow color tones are more\r\ntinged with orange. The female is strikingly different, the wings\r\nbeing plain pale yellowish buff marked only with a round blackish\r\neye-spot near the middle of each front wing and the barest suggestion\r\nof a dark line around the extreme margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Clouded Sulphur=\r\n  _Eurymus philodice_\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that the butterfly which one is most likely\r\nto find in fields and along roadsides during practically all the weeks\r\nof summer has seldom if ever been noted as a destructive insect. The\r\nClouded Sulphur is probably the commonest species in its group. There\r\nmay be times when the White Cabbage butterfly or other forms are more\r\nabundant, but the Clouded Sulphur retains its place season after\r\nseason, with comparatively little noticeable variation in its numbers.\r\nThis is doubtless an illustration of an insect which has established\r\nsuch relations with its food plants and its various insect and other\r\nenemies that it remains in a fairly stable equilibrium--an example of\r\nwhat is often called the balance of nature.\r\n\r\nThe Clouded Sulphur is about the only medium-sized yellow butterfly\r\ngenerally found in the Northeastern states. The adults may be seen\r\nfrom spring until autumn. They lay eggs upon clover and other plants.\r\nThese eggs hatch into small green caterpillars that feed upon the\r\nleaves and are protectively colored so they are comparatively seldom\r\nseen. When the food plant is disturbed they drop to the ground,\r\ncrawling up again upon stems and leaves when the disturbance is over.\r\n\r\nThese caterpillars moult several times during their growth. When full\r\ngrown they find such shelter as they are able and each spins a silken\r\nweb over part of the surface. It then fastens its hind legs into this\r\nweb and later spins a loop near the front end of the body. It pushes\r\nitself beneath this loop and waits for several hours before the skin\r\nbreaks open along the back and is gradually shuffled off revealing the\r\nchrysalis in position. A week or two later the fully developed\r\nbutterfly emerges from the chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThese yellow butterflies lend a distinctive charm to our summer\r\nlandscapes. They are constantly to be seen fluttering from place to\r\nplace, lightly visiting flowers of many kinds from which they suck the\r\nnectar, and gathering in great colonies by roadside pools where they\r\nseem to sip the moisture. There are many references to this insect in\r\nthe writings of New England authors. It evidently was an especial\r\nfavorite of James Russell Lowell who has often referred to it in\r\npassages like this:\r\n\r\n\"Those old days when the balancing of a yellow butterfly over a\r\nthistle bloom was spiritual food and lodging for a whole forenoon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Orange Sulphur=\r\n  _Eurymus eurytheme_\r\n\r\nWere one able to take a Clouded Sulphur butterfly and change the\r\nyellow to a deep orange color he could easily make a specimen that\r\nwould pass for the present species. The resemblance is very\r\nremarkable and shows the close affinity between these two beautiful\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nLike so many others of this group the Orange Sulphur is essentially a\r\ntropical species. In the eastern United States it is rarely found\r\nnorth of latitude forty degrees, but south of that it becomes\r\nincreasingly abundant as one approaches the tropics. It occurs from\r\nthe Carolinas to Texas, and over the great range in which it lives it\r\ntakes on many different forms and habits. It is one of the most\r\nremarkable examples of variation in coloring exhibited by any of the\r\nbutterflies. Nearly a dozen species names have been given to its\r\nvarious disguises, all of which are now recognized as synonyms. In the\r\nmore northern regions where it is found, only one of these forms\r\nusually occurs, but in other places bright yellow and pale white\r\nvarieties are found.\r\n\r\nThe life-history of this butterfly along latitude forty degrees is\r\nvery similar to that of the Clouded Sulphur. There seem to be usually\r\ntwo broods and the caterpillars live upon leguminous plants,\r\nespecially alfalfa, buffalo clovers, wild senna, and other species of\r\nTrifolium and Cassia. Apparently also it hibernates in both the\r\ncaterpillar and the butterfly stages.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme Southwest--as on the plains of Texas--the vegetation\r\ndries up completely in summer so that there is no succulent leafage\r\nfor the caterpillars to live upon. In such cases the insect must\r\naestivate rather than hibernate. This species apparently succeeds in\r\ndoing this by having the caterpillars go into a more or less lethargic\r\ncondition in which they pass the summer. The adult butterflies utterly\r\ndisappear in June and are not seen again until early in autumn when\r\nthe autumn rains have started the growth of vegetation anew. The\r\ninsects then make up for lost time and produce several broods in rapid\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nIn the Imperial Valley of California this butterfly is a serious pest\r\nto alfalfa growers. It continues to reproduce throughout a very long\r\nseason, one brood following another from March until December, and in\r\nmild winters there seems sometimes to be practically no cessation of\r\nits activities. Mr. V. L. Wildermuth found that the development of a\r\ngeneration in breeding cages in this valley varied from twenty-two to\r\nforty-four days, the latter in cool, the former in hot weather. The\r\nstages in the first and the third broods in spring varied thus: Egg,\r\nfirst six days, third four days; larva, first thirty days, third\r\ntwelve days; chrysalis, first eight days, third five days. In this\r\ncase the first generation extended from March 15 to April 30 and the\r\nthird from May 28 to June 20. After the fourth brood of butterflies\r\nthere was such an overlapping of the various stages that it was\r\nimpossible to distinguish the broods.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Pink-edged Sulphur=\r\n  _Eurymus interior_\r\n\r\nThis beautiful butterfly was first made known to the world of science\r\nby Louis Agassiz, the great naturalist who did so much to arouse a\r\nscientific interest among Americans. He found it on a famous\r\nexpedition to the northern shores of Lake Superior, which not only\r\nserved to bring to light many interesting phases of geological history\r\nbut also laid the foundation for the copper mining industry which has\r\nsince become so important in that region. The butterfly thus brought\r\nto light has been found to be a characteristic northern species,\r\noccupying a rather narrow belt nearly along the fiftieth degree of\r\nlatitude and extending west almost to the Pacific Coast. The species\r\nis occasionally taken as far south as the White Mountains and there\r\nare indications that in this region there are two broods a year. The\r\nmale butterflies are known at once by a beautiful pink edge on all the\r\nmargins; they bear otherwise a close resemblance to our common Sulphur\r\nYellow. The females are much lighter in color, often having no black\r\nmarkings on the upper surface of the hind wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Black-bordered Yellow=\r\n  _Eurema nicippe_\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a tropical butterfly which has spread out over\r\nmost of our Southern states where it is abundant and widely\r\ndistributed. It adds a distinct touch of color and life to many\r\nlandscapes when the butterflies swarm by thousands upon clover\r\nblossoms and other low vegetation. The eggs are laid upon the leaves\r\nof clover and more especially upon some common species of Cassia, such\r\nas wild senna. Each egg soon hatches into a small greenish cylindrical\r\nworm, colored and striped in such a way that as it rests upon the leaf\r\nit is easily overlooked. This larva develops rapidly and soon becomes\r\nabout an inch and a quarter long, being rather slender and fairly\r\nsmooth. It now spins a bit of silk upon a twig or some similar support\r\nand also the frailest sort of a silken loop to pass around its back.\r\nIt now entangles its hind feet in the bit of silk and soon casts off\r\nits last caterpillar skin, emerging as a curious looking chrysalis\r\nabout three quarters of an inch long with a remarkable pointed\r\nprojection on the front of the head. When seen through a hand lens\r\nthis pointed projection and the well-developed characteristic wing\r\nsheaths give the chrysalis a remarkable resemblance to some of the\r\ntwig hoppers or Membracids. The colors vary considerably with the\r\nsurroundings but are commonly toned in various shades of green and\r\nyellow brown.\r\n\r\nA little later each chrysalis breaks open to disclose one of the\r\nbeautiful butterflies.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which this butterfly lives at the limit of its\r\nnorthern range are not well determined. It is probable that many of\r\nthose seen here have flown from considerably farther south, and that\r\nthese migrants lay eggs from which a brood of butterflies develops,\r\nthese native born appearing late in summer. Presumably the latter\r\nhibernate, but whether they can do this successfully under the\r\nrigorous conditions of our northern winters has never been determined.\r\nIn fact, Scudder wrote some years ago that no caterpillars had ever\r\nbeen found in New England. Here is an interesting opportunity for some\r\nyoung observer to make a real contribution to science.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Little Sulphur=\r\n  _Eurema lisa_\r\n\r\nWere one to imagine a Clouded Sulphur butterfly reduced to half its\r\nusual size and built with a corresponding delicacy of structure, one\r\nwould have a pretty good idea of the beautiful little creature called\r\nby the above name. I well remember in my college days taking what was\r\nprobably the first of these butterflies ever collected in the region\r\nof our Michigan college. It was a prize that very likely had wandered\r\nnorth from Indiana but which served to add much glory to the little\r\ncollection in which I took such pride, for this is essentially a\r\nsouthern species. In many regions of the South it is so abundant that\r\nit can be taken by any one. It ranges from coast to coast and extends\r\nsouth into the tropics. In the eastern region it is found from\r\nsouthern Wisconsin to southern New England, occurring sparingly and\r\nlocally in various places along the line thus indicated.\r\n\r\nThe food plant of the species is chiefly wild senna or other kinds of\r\nCassia. The mother butterflies deposit the eggs singly on leaves or\r\nstems, generally on the small leaflets of the compound leaf. Less than\r\na week later each egg hatches into a cylindrical greenish caterpillar\r\nthat feeds upon the leaflets in a characteristic fashion. Instead of\r\ndevouring the blade from the margin inward it gnaws narrow strips\r\nbetween the smaller veins. When not feeding, the caterpillars protect\r\nthemselves from observation by birds or other enemies by resting\r\nmotionless along the stem of the leaflet or else along the midrib on\r\nthe under side. As is well known the leaflets of Cassia, like other\r\nleguminous plants, close at night. It is probably on this account that\r\nthese caterpillars feed chiefly by day. The general green color of the\r\nskin and the straight stripe along the side help to make this\r\ncaterpillar very inconspicuous when it is at rest.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown the caterpillar reaches a length of three quarters of\r\nan inch. It now finds some bit of shelter on which it spins a bit of\r\nflat web and a silken loop to hold it in place as it becomes a\r\nchrysalis. It then changes and remains quiescent for ten days or more\r\nwhen it emerges as the dainty butterfly.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its abundance and its successive broods its\r\nlife-history is none too completely worked out. There is still\r\nopportunity for careful observations upon the way in which it passes\r\nthe winter in various parts of its range. While in the South it\r\napparently hibernates as an adult, this fact is not certain in the\r\nmore northern localities.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its diminutive size this butterfly has been known to\r\nswarm in such enormous numbers as to seem a veritable cloud. The most\r\nnotable record of this has been quoted by Scudder in connection with a\r\nswarm that invaded the Bermuda Islands, in 1874, on the first day of\r\nOctober. It was described in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Early in the morning several persons living on the north side of the\r\nmain island perceived, as they thought, a cloud coming over from the\r\nnorthwest, which drew nearer and nearer to the shore, on reaching\r\nwhich it divided into two parts, one of which went eastward and the\r\nother westward, gradually falling upon the land. They were not long in\r\nascertaining that what they had taken for a cloud was an immense\r\nconcourse of small yellow butterflies, which flitted about all the\r\nopen grassy patches in a lazy manner, as if fatigued after their long\r\nvoyage over the deep. Fishermen out near the reefs, some few miles to\r\nthe north of the islands very early that morning, stated that numbers\r\nof these insects fell upon their boats, literally covering them.\"\r\n\r\nAs is the case with so many of the related yellow butterflies there is\r\nan albino variety of this species. It has been given the variety name\r\n_alba_ although it is really a pale yellow rather than a true albino\r\nform.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Dainty Sulphur=\r\n  _Nathalis iole_\r\n\r\nWhile the Little Sulphur butterfly seems about as delicate a creature\r\nas one could ask to see, it loses that distinction when it is compared\r\nwith the still smaller Dainty Sulphur. The latter expands scarcely an\r\ninch when its wings are stretched apart, and its slender body and\r\nantennae help to give the suggestion of extreme delicacy. There is\r\nmore marking of black upon the sulphur-yellow wings than is the case\r\nwith the larger form, the upper portion of the front wings showing\r\nonly a broad yellow band upon a background of darker color. The under\r\nwings are nearly all yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Yellows_\r\n\r\n_Brimstone_ or _Cloudless Sulphur_ (_Callidryas eubule_ or\r\n_Catopsilia eubule_). Expanse 2 1/2 inches.

Expanse 2 inches. Upper surface of wings bright\r\norange with a small black dash in front of the middle of each front\r\nwing and a broad black border on all the wings. In the females the\r\nborders are interrupted at the rear. Under surface slightly brownish\r\nyellow, minutely striated and clouded when exposed when the butterfly\r\nalights.\r\n\r\n_Little Sulphur_ (_Eurema euterpe_, _Eurema lisa_, _Xanthidia lisa_ or\r\n_Terias lisa_).

Easily known by\r\nits small size and narrow yellow wings with black bars across the\r\nouter angles and black bands across the back border of the front wings\r\nand the front border of the hind wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPHS\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Nymphalidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nA large proportion of our most familiar butterflies belongs to this\r\nfamily. The Fritillaries, the Angle-wings, the Sovereigns, and the\r\nEmperors are tribes in which practically all the species are of medium\r\nor large size. The Crescent-spots include a few which are rather\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe combinations of characters by which the Nymph family is\r\ndistinguished are these: Front legs dwarfed into lappets; scaly\r\nantennae; veins of fore wings not swollen at base; wings of normal\r\nshape, not much longer than wide. Larvae cylindrical, but varying\r\ngreatly in form, color, and skin coverings. Chrysalids angular in\r\nmost species, in others rounded.\r\n\r\nThe stories of the lives of the many members of this family vary\r\nconsiderably, as one would expect from their variety and numbers. We\r\nmay take, however, the life of the familiar Antiopa or Mourning Cloak\r\nas typical of the group. Briefly summarized, its story may thus be\r\ntold:\r\n\r\nDuring sunny days in spring one may often see a beautiful purple-back\r\nbutterfly, having a cream-colored border along the outer margin of its\r\nwings, flying leisurely about, in the vicinity of woods and in the\r\nopen fields. This insect is called the Antiopa or Mourning Cloak; it\r\nis represented natural size in plate opposite page 145. It has passed\r\nthe winter in this adult condition, having found shelter in some\r\nretreat where it is not directly exposed to the storm and stress of\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves of the elm, willow, and poplar trees are nearly\r\nexpanded, these butterflies deposit their eggs upon the twigs. These\r\neggs are laid in clusters encircling the twigs, there being twenty or\r\nmore in each cluster. In the act of oviposition, the butterfly keeps\r\nher wings spread out, moving the body and abdomen about as the placing\r\nof the eggs necessitates.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks after the clusters of eggs are thus laid upon the\r\ntwigs of the food plant, they hatch into small blackish caterpillars,\r\neach emerging from the egg shell through a small hole that it eats out\r\nof the upper surface. They thus enter upon the second stage in their\r\nlife-history--the larva or caterpillar stage. As soon as hatched, they\r\ncrawl to the nearest leaf upon which they range themselves side by\r\nside, with their heads toward the margin of the leaf. They feed in\r\nthis position, nibbling at the green surface of the leaf-blade and\r\nleaving the network of veins untouched.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:                                      _See page 76_\r\n\r\n     THE ZEBRA SWALLOWTAIL\r\n       Summer form: upper surface, above; under surface, below]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by Mary E. Walker_  _See Page 101_\r\n\r\n     THE CLOUDED SULPHUR BUTTERFLY\r\n       Caterpillar and butterfly on red clover plant. (Reduced)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by Mary E. Walker_   _See page 76_\r\n\r\n     ZEBRA SWALLOWTAILS\r\n       Visiting blossoming branches of the pawpaw tree. (Reduced)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:                                 _See pages 97-115_\r\n\r\n     SOME OF THE TRIBE OF YELLOWS\r\n       upper surfaces at left; under surfaces at right\r\n\r\n       (1) The Black-bordered Yellow--male;\r\n       (2) the Clouded Sulphur--male;\r\n       (3) the Orange Sulphur--female;\r\n       (4) the Dog's-head--male]\r\n\r\nThese caterpillars continue to feed in this manner for about a week,\r\nremaining side by side when feeding, and marching in processions from\r\none leaf to another as the food supply is exhausted. Wherever they go,\r\neach spins a silken thread on the surface traversed, so that the\r\ncombination of all the threads makes a sort of carpet that serves as a\r\nfoothold for the caterpillars. At the end of the week they moult or\r\ncast their skins, a process in which the skin of each larva splits\r\nopen along the back, and the larva crawls out covered with a new skin\r\nthat had been formed beneath the old one. This new skin stretches\r\nsomewhat after the caterpillar emerges, so that the insect is able to\r\nincrease considerably in size. At the period of moulting, the\r\ncaterpillars remain quiet for a short time, but they soon become\r\nactive again and begin feeding with increased voracity.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Eggs of Mourning-Cloak, laid in a cluster on a\r\n     twig. (From Holland).]\r\n\r\nDuring the next three weeks, this moulting process is repeated three\r\ntimes, the caterpillars becoming larger each time, and leaving their\r\ncast skins upon the denuded twigs. They soon scatter more or less over\r\nneighboring leaves, but remain in closely associated colonies. As they\r\nincrease in size, they eat more and more of the leaf substance; when\r\nhalf grown, they devour all but the midrib and the side veins; but\r\nwhen they get larger, only the midribs are left.\r\n\r\nThe carpet web that they form becomes more conspicuous as the\r\ncaterpillars become full grown. They then leave the tree or shrub on\r\nwhich they have been feeding, and scatter about, seeking some\r\nsheltered situation. Having found this--perhaps beneath a stump or\r\nalong the under side of a fence--each caterpillar spins a web of silk\r\nalong the surface. It then entangles the hooked claws of its hind legs\r\nin the silken web, and lets its body hang vertically with the head end\r\ncurved upward. It remains in this position some hours before the skin\r\nalong the back just behind the head splits apart and is gradually\r\nwriggled upward, until finally it is all removed and there hangs in\r\nplace of the caterpillar a peculiar object having no definite form.\r\nBut it rapidly assumes a definite form--that of the chrysalis--which\r\nis grayish brown, different specimens varying somewhat in shade.\r\n\r\nIn this quiet chrysalis, the insect is apparently almost as inert as a\r\nmummy. If you touch it it will wriggle a little, but otherwise it\r\nhangs there mute and helpless. On the inside, however, the tissues are\r\nbeing made over in such a wonderful way that, in about two weeks, from\r\nthe mummy case into which the caterpillar entered there comes a\r\nbeautiful butterfly.\r\n\r\nWhen this butterfly first breaks through the mummy shell, its wings\r\nare very small, although its body, antennae, and legs are well\r\ndeveloped. By means of the latter, it clings to the empty chrysalis,\r\nwhile its wings expand. At first these wings are short, but as soon as\r\nthe insect takes a position in which the wings hang downward, they\r\nbegin to expand, and soon reach full length, but are more or less\r\ncrumpled longitudinally, and the front wings are not so wide as the\r\nhind ones, hanging limply inside the latter.\r\n\r\nAfter the butterfly has thus reached its full form and size, it crawls\r\nfrom the chrysalis to some neighboring support, where it rests quietly\r\nfor half an hour or more. During the latter part of this time it\r\nexercises its unused muscles by slowly opening and closing its wings,\r\nuntil it finally flies away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE FRITILLARIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most distinctive tribes of the family of Nymphs.\r\nThe clubs of the antennae are about twice as long as broad and\r\ncuriously spoon-shaped. The palpi are large and bushy, with the last\r\njoint very short. Most of the species are rather large and practically\r\nall are beautifully mottled in various tones of brown, red, black, and\r\nsilvery gray. A large proportion of our midsummer butterflies are\r\nmembers of this tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Gulf Fritillary=\r\n  _Agraulis vanillae_\r\n\r\nIn tropical America there is a genus of butterflies called Agraulis.\r\nThese are fairly large insects, approximating the size of the Viceroy,\r\nwhich show most beautiful colors in the tropical sunshine. One member\r\nof this genus has come north to our Southern states, and is\r\noccasionally found as far up as Virginia and southern Illinois,\r\nextending below this from ocean to ocean. It reveals on its upper\r\nsurface the most exquisite tints of iridescent purples and browns,\r\nsuggesting by its form and color as thus seen a tropical species. The\r\nlower wing surface, when the wings are closed in their natural\r\nposition, shows only a spangled effect of silver-white and brown,\r\nwhich is very suggestive of the under surface of our northern Spangled\r\nFritillaries. So this beautiful species may fittingly be called the\r\nGulf Fritillary, carrying over from the north some of its peculiar\r\nbeauty and connecting with the equally distinctive beauty of the\r\ntropical south.\r\n\r\nLike so many other southern butterflies the eggs of this species are\r\nlaid upon the leaves of passion vines. The caterpillars develop very\r\nrapidly and when matured are yellowish or brownish yellow, striped\r\nwith darker lines along the back and sides. There are black branching\r\nspines, arranged in rows beginning on the head and running backward on\r\nthe body. The whole cycle of life from egg to butterfly may take place\r\nwithin the short period of a month and one brood succeeds another in\r\nso irregular and rapid a fashion that it is difficult to determine\r\ndefinitely the number of broods in a season.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Variegated Fritillary=\r\n  _Euptoieta claudia_\r\n\r\nThere is something in the appearance of the upper surface of this\r\nbutterfly that suggests the other Fritillaries on the one hand and the\r\nEmperors on the other. The coloring and marking is a bit like the\r\nformer and the shape of the wings like the latter. The general color\r\nis a golden brown with darker markings arranged in bands and eye-spots\r\nin a rather complicated pattern. The under surface, so far as it is\r\nexposed when the butterfly is at rest, is a beautiful marbled\r\ncombination of gray and brown which is probably distinctly\r\nobliterative in the haunts of these insects. The front wings have the\r\nouter margin concave in the middle, giving a special prominence to the\r\nshape of each front outer angle.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is a southern rather than a northern species, but it is\r\nfound occasionally from Montana to Massachusetts and southward to\r\nArizona, Mexico, and Florida. Even in northern Indiana it is very\r\nseldom found and is considered rare in the southern part of that\r\nstate. Around Buffalo, New York, it is also rare and is not common in\r\nthe vicinity of New York City. In the more Southern states, however,\r\nit is abundant and extends well through the continent of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable evidence to indicate that this butterfly\r\nhibernates as an adult. In the more southern regions it probably also\r\nhibernates in other stages, especially the chrysalis and the larva. In\r\nregions where it is double-brooded, as it appears to be in the\r\nlatitude of New York City, the seasonal history seems to run something\r\nlike this: the partly grown caterpillars which have passed the winter\r\nin shelter at the surface of the soil feed upon the leaves of violets\r\nand certain other plants. They change to chrysalids, probably in May,\r\nand emerge as butterflies in June. These butterflies lay eggs for a\r\nsummer brood of caterpillars which may feed upon the leaves of\r\nviolets, May apples, portulaca, and stonecrop. They grow into\r\ncylindrical worms of a general reddish yellow color, marked by\r\nlongitudinal stripes of brown upon the sides and a row of whitish dots\r\nupon the back. They become matured in time to disclose the butterflies\r\nof the second brood in August and September. Presumably these\r\nbutterflies lay eggs that develop into caterpillars which hibernate\r\nwhen partially grown.\r\n\r\nFarther south there are probably three broods a year and hibernation\r\nmay take place in various stages. There is good opportunity for\r\ncareful work in determining the life-history of the species in\r\ndifferent latitudes. The butterfly is found in much the same\r\nsituations as the other Fritillaries, flying over meadows and along\r\nthe borders of woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Diana Fritillary=\r\n  _Argynnis diana_\r\n\r\nThis magnificent butterfly differs from the other Fritillaries in the\r\nfact that the females are so unlike the males that only a skilled\r\nnaturalist would even guess that they are related. Both sexes are\r\nrather rare and are found only in a comparatively narrow range\r\nextending from West Virginia to Missouri, northward to Ohio and\r\nIndiana, and southward to Georgia and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThis species was first described by Cramer a long time ago from\r\nspecimens of the male sex. It was later described by Say and other\r\nwriters all of whom saw only the males. The other sex was first\r\nrecognized by William H. Edwards, whose account of its discovery as\r\ngiven in his splendid work on the Butterflies of North America is\r\nworth quoting:\r\n\r\n\"No mention is made of the female by any author,\" wrote Mr. Edwards,\r\n\"and it seems to have been unknown till its discovery by me in 1864 in\r\nKanawha County, West Virginia. On the 20th August, I saw, for the\r\nfirst time, a male hovering about the flowers of the iron-weed\r\n(_Vernonia fasciculata_), and succeeded in taking it. Two days\r\nafterwards, in same vicinity, while breaking my way through a dense\r\nthicket of the same weed, hoping to find another Diana, I came\r\nsuddenly upon a large black and blue butterfly feeding so quietly as\r\nto allow me to stand near it some seconds and watch its motions. It\r\nseemed to be a new species of Limenitis, allied to Ursula, which it\r\nresembled in color. But on taking it, I saw it was a female Argynnis,\r\nand the general pattern of the under wing left little doubt of its\r\naffinity to the Diana male, despite its total difference in color and\r\nof upper surface. Subsequent captures confirmed this conjecture, and\r\nout of the large number that have since been taken the males have been\r\nof the known type and the females black, with no tendency in either to\r\nvary in the direction of the other.\r\n\r\n\"When my attention was called to the species I found it not very\r\nuncommon, always upon or near the iron-weed, which is very abundant\r\nand grows in rank luxuriance upon the rich bottom lands of the Kanawha\r\nRiver, frequently reaching a height from eight to ten feet and in\r\nAugust covered by heads of purple flowers that possess a remarkable\r\nattraction for most butterflies. Both sexes are conspicuous, the males\r\nfrom the strong contrast of color and the females from their great\r\nsize and the habit of alighting on the topmost flower and resting with\r\nwings erect and motionless. It is an exceedingly alert and wary\r\nspecies, differing in this from our other Argynnids. At the slightest\r\nalarm it will fly high into the woods near which, upon the narrow\r\nbottoms or river slopes, it is invariably found. It is a true southern\r\nspecies, sensitive to cold, not to be looked for in the cooler part of\r\nthe morning but flying down from the forest when the sun is well up.\r\nFrom eleven to three o'clock is its feeding time.\"\r\n\r\nThe life-history of this fine butterfly is similar to that of the\r\nlesser Fritillaries. The butterflies appear from midsummer onward, the\r\nmales preceding the females, and the eggs are laid on or near violets\r\nin August or September. The larvae hibernate and mature early the\r\nfollowing summer. As they approach the chrysalis stage they are rather\r\nlarge velvety black caterpillars with brown heads and rows of fleshy\r\nbarbed spines that show an orange tint at their bases. There is thus\r\nbut one generation each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Regal Fritillary=\r\n  _Argynnis idalia_\r\n\r\nThe Regal Fritillary, fresh from the chrysalis, still showing the\r\nmarvelous sheen of its iridescence, furnishes one of the most\r\nbeautiful exhibitions of color in the world of nature. Over the whole\r\nwing surface there are tiny scales that reflect the sunlight in an\r\nalmost dazzling manner, giving a distinct purplish tone especially to\r\nthe hind wings.\r\n\r\nThe Regal Fritillary is one of the largest butterflies of the\r\ndistinctive group to which it belongs. The wings expand some three\r\ninches and the rather thick body is more than an inch long. The\r\ngeneral ground color of the wings is brown, with distinct markings of\r\nblackish which in the hind wings almost obscure the brown. On each of\r\nthe latter as seen from above there is a distinct row of cream-colored\r\nspots across the middle, duplicated by a similar row of brown spots\r\nnear the margin. The under surface of both pairs of wings is much\r\nlighter and thickly mottled all over with light cream-colored spots of\r\na large size and more or less triangular shape. (_See frontispiece._)\r\n\r\nLike the other Argynnids, the Regal Fritillary is single-brooded\r\nduring the year and it has a rather remarkable longevity in each stage\r\nof its life. The newly hatched caterpillars go into hibernation and\r\nlive through the winter without feeding, finding shelter at the\r\nsurface of the ground, especially beneath the leaves of violets which\r\nform their chosen food plants. When the snow has disappeared and the\r\nwarmth of the spring sun brings them out of their winter lethargy\r\nthese tiny caterpillars feed upon the violet leaves and grow slowly\r\nfor several weeks. They then change to chrysalids, the time for doing\r\nthis varying considerably with the individual and doubtless with the\r\nwarmth of the situation in which each is living. The length of time\r\nspent in the chrysalis varies also, but in general it seems to be less\r\nfor those which develop into male butterflies than for the females. It\r\nis a curious fact that the former may be found for nearly two weeks\r\nbefore any of the latter appear.\r\n\r\nThe first butterflies of this species are usually disclosed from the\r\nchrysalis late in June or early in July. They continue to come forth\r\nfor several weeks, apparently until nearly the middle of August. They\r\nlead a leisurely life, visiting freely the flowers of goldenrod,\r\niron-weed, boneset, Joe Pye weed, and especially swamp milkweed. They\r\nare most likely to be found in lowlands and along the borders of\r\nswamps where these favorite flowers are growing. It evidently requires\r\nsome time for the eggs to develop within the ovaries, for the\r\nbutterfly cannot begin laying these until the latter part of August.\r\nThey apparently are normally deposited on the under side of violet\r\nleaves, although so far as I know no butterfly has been seen thus\r\nlaying her eggs. It would be an interesting point for some young\r\nobserver to determine. Even the eggs take a long time to develop, not\r\nhatching for three or four weeks after they are laid. When they do\r\nhatch the tiny caterpillars seem not to eat at all but to go directly\r\ninto hibernation.\r\n\r\nThese butterflies are to be found in their preferred habitats almost\r\nany time during July, August, and September. Apparently many of them\r\nlive as adults for nearly three months so that whether we consider the\r\negg, the larva, the chrysalis, or the adult we have in this species an\r\nunusual duration of life. This is doubtless an adaptation to the fact\r\nthat the species must get through the year with only one brood.\r\n\r\nThis unity of habit with no such variations as occur in many\r\nbutterflies with a wider range north and south is apparently\r\ncorrelated with the distribution of this butterfly. It is found in a\r\nbelt of territory running from New England and the Atlantic states\r\nwestward at least to Nebraska along a line which approximates the\r\nannual isotherm of fifty degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Great Spangled Fritillary=\r\n  _Argynnis cybele_\r\n\r\nTo one who wanders much in the woods and open fields there are few\r\nsummer scenes more characteristic of the season than that of a group\r\nof milkweeds in full flower, surrounded by a host of brown butterflies\r\nbusily sucking the nectar from the curious pink blossoms. There are\r\nlikely to be several species of these winged creatures, but in many\r\nregions of America the largest and most conspicuous will generally be\r\nthe Great Spangled Fritillary. This butterfly is easily recognized by\r\nits large size and its combination of two colors of brown, with\r\nwhitish or silverish spots scattered over the lower surface of the\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe life-history of this insect is of peculiar interest on account of\r\nthe way in which it passes the winter. The mother butterfly remains\r\nupon the wing through many weeks in summer, so that toward the end of\r\nAugust or early September a large proportion of the specimens have a\r\ndecidedly frayed appearance. They are patiently waiting for the season\r\nof the year when they can deposit their eggs, apparently knowing by\r\ninstinct that this must not be done until early autumn. When the\r\nproper season arrives they lay their eggs upon the leaves or stems of\r\nwild violets, apparently without much reference to the particular\r\nspecies. Sometimes they have been reported simply to drop the eggs\r\nloosely upon the violet plant with no attempt to fasten them in place.\r\nHaving thus deposited the eggs the mother butterflies soon die.\r\n\r\nIt would not seem strange if these eggs remained unhatched until the\r\nfollowing spring, but the fact is that the eggs hatch very soon into\r\nsmall caterpillars that eat off part of the shells in order to escape\r\nand sometimes eat also part of the shell remaining after they have\r\nemerged. Various good observers have apparently established the fact\r\nthat these tiny caterpillars eat nothing else before winter sets in.\r\nIt seems curious indeed that they should not nibble at the leaves or\r\nstems of the violet plants in order to be slightly prepared for the\r\nlong fast that awaits them before they will find food upon the young\r\nbuds the following spring. The case is somewhat similar to that of\r\nthe common tent caterpillar which becomes a fully formed caterpillar\r\nwithin the egg shell before the end of autumn, but remains unhatched\r\nuntil the following spring. In the present case the caterpillar\r\nhibernates outside of the egg shell rather than within it.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the warm sunshine of spring starts the violets into new\r\ngrowth the tiny caterpillars begin feeding upon the succulent tissues.\r\nThey nibble away day after day for a week or more before they become\r\nso large that they have to cast their skin for the first time. They\r\nthen feed again and continue this process of feeding and moulting\r\nuntil early in summer. They are likely to hide themselves during\r\ndaylight and have the reputation of being difficult to rear under\r\nartificial conditions.\r\n\r\nThe full-grown caterpillar wanders along the surface of the ground in\r\nsearch of suitable shelter for the chrysalis period. When it comes to\r\na large stone with sides projecting more or less horizontally or a log\r\nlying upon the ground or even a large piece of loose bark it is likely\r\nto stop and change to the pupa or chrysalis. In this condition it is\r\ndark brown in color and well covered with thickened tubercles,\r\nespecially along the back of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight later the chrysalis breaks open and the fully\r\ndeveloped butterfly comes forth. It rests quietly for a time while its\r\nwings expand and the tissues harden and then sallies forth for its\r\nlong period of flight; for this insect is single-brooded in the\r\nNorthern states at least and the butterflies that thus mature late in\r\nJune or early in July are likely to remain alive until early in\r\nSeptember. So they have a comparatively long life for a butterfly that\r\ndoes not hibernate as an adult.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Silver-spot Fritillary=\r\n  _Argynnis aphrodite_\r\n\r\nOur brown Fritillaries are seldom found without several species\r\nmingling together. This is not strange, for they have similar habits\r\nthroughout their entire lives. So when you see a bevy of butterflies\r\ncollected around the midsummer blossoms of the milkweed, you are\r\npretty sure to find that the Great Spangled Fritillary is associated\r\nwith the Silver-spot and probably one or two other related forms. The\r\nSilver-spot is generally decidedly smaller than the one first named\r\nand the surest way to be certain of it is to look on the under side of\r\nthe hind wing and see whether there is a broad band of buff between\r\nthe two outer rows of silver spots. If this band has disappeared or is\r\nnearly all taken up by the brown ground-color of the wing, you may be\r\npretty sure we have the Silver-spot Fritillary.\r\n\r\nWhen one has firmly fixed in mind the life cycle of one of these\r\nbutterflies, one has a model after which to fashion the rest, for our\r\nseveral species are remarkably alike in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe Silver-spots are on the wing for several weeks in summer. During\r\nthe latter part of this time the females lay eggs upon violet leaves.\r\nThese eggs shortly hatch into caterpillars that go directly into\r\nhibernation, taking no food before winter sets in. The following\r\nspring they feed upon violet leaves and mature in time to change to\r\nchrysalids and emerge as butterflies in early summer. There is but one\r\nbrood a year and the species is widely distributed over southern\r\nCanada and the Northern states. It extends south to Virginia and\r\nPennsylvania and west to Nebraska, Montana, and Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Mountain Silver-spot=\r\n  _Argynnis atlantis_\r\n\r\nIf one were able to take a Silver-spot Fritillary and reduce its size\r\nabout one third he would have a wonderfully good imitation of the\r\npresent species. Except for the size, about the only difference in the\r\nmarkings is found in the blackish border along the margins of the\r\nMountain Silver-spot which is not present in the other species. The\r\nbuff sub-marginal border line on the under surface of the wings\r\nbetween the rows of silver spots is also wider in the mountain\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of this butterfly justifies its name. It is\r\npreeminently a northern species, being especially abundant in the\r\nWhite Mountains of New Hampshire and ranging northward far into Canada\r\nand west through British America as far as the Mackenzie River. A pair\r\nof these butterflies were captured by Merritt Carey on July 16, 1903,\r\non the summit of Mount Tha-on-tha, in the Nahanni Mountains, at an\r\naltitude of 2,500 feet. The southern limit of its distribution\r\napproximates the isotherm of forty-five degrees. It extends southward\r\nin mountainous regions through New York and Pennsylvania and is found\r\nin Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa. It also occurs in the Rocky Mountain\r\nregion of Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe various species of Argynnis show a remarkable uniformity in their\r\nlife-history. Like the others, this butterfly is single-brooded,\r\nlaying the eggs on or near violets late in summer, the eggs hatching\r\ninto larvae that take no food until the following spring. They then\r\nfeed upon the violet leaves, become mature, and change to chrysalids\r\nin time for the butterflies to emerge in June in New Hampshire. These\r\nbutterflies remain upon the wing for several weeks. They usually\r\nappear a week or two earlier than Aphrodite or Cybele in regions where\r\nall three species are found. It is worth while for the collector to\r\ntake a hint from this fact and do his Silver-spot collecting early.\r\nFor after the other species appear it is not so easy to tell which is\r\nAtlantis when the butterflies are on the wing. It is most likely to be\r\nfound in open places in the woods, apparently preferring such\r\nsituations to the broad expanse of fields and meadows.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The White Mountain Fritillary=\r\n  _Argynnis montinus_\r\n\r\nThis is distinctly a mountain butterfly, known to be found only near\r\nthe top of Mount Washington and other neighboring parts of the White\r\nMountains. It generally occurs between the altitudes of four thousand\r\nand fifty-five hundred feet. It is doubtless closely related to a\r\nsomewhat similar form found farther north and west, but its isolation\r\nfrom them is complete. Apparently it is single-brooded and very little\r\nis known of the early stages. The butterflies visit the flowers of\r\ngoldenrod and those of the alpine sand-wort which are abundant in the\r\nsub-alpine home of this species.\r\n\r\nThis variety is interesting as a living souvenir of the day when New\r\nEngland was buried beneath the ice-sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Meadow Fritillary=\r\n  _Brenthis bellona_\r\n\r\nThe fact of variation is one of the most universal things in nature.\r\nNo two animals are exactly alike and every plant differs from every\r\nother plant. That this is true of the structure of living things is\r\neasily observed but it is not so well known, because not so easily\r\nobserved, that most species of animals differ also in the precise\r\nphases of their growth. We know that the variation in form and color\r\nhas brought about the remarkable adaptations to surroundings which we\r\ncall mimicry and protective coloration. A little consideration will\r\nmake it evident that the variation of different individuals in periods\r\nof growth must have led also to the adaptation of the life stages to\r\nthe conditions of the changing seasons. This is particularly true in\r\nthe great majority of insects which show remarkable adaptations in\r\ntheir various broods to the seasonal conditions of the localities\r\nwhere they live.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view the attractive little Meadow Fritillary is of\r\nespecial interest. We are indebted to the studies of S. H. Scudder for\r\nour knowledge of the remarkable variations in its growth. These are so\r\ncomplicated that in order to make plain the varying conditions it\r\nseems necessary to separate the broods in a somewhat hypothetical\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:\r\n\r\n     THE SILVER-SPOT FRITILLARY\r\n       Upper and lower surfaces (_see page 125_)\r\n\r\n     THE GULF FRITILLARY\r\n       Lower Surface (_see page 115_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:\r\n\r\n     THE GULF FRITILLARY (_see page 115_)\r\n\r\n     THE SILVER-BORDERED FRITILLARY\r\n       Upper and under surfaces (_see page 131_)\r\n\r\n     THE BALTIMORE CHECKER-SPOT\r\n       Upper and under surfaces (_see page 135_)]\r\n\r\nWe will begin with what we shall call Group A: The butterflies are on\r\nthe wing in May and early June. They have just come from the chrysalis\r\nand continue living for three or four weeks before they deposit eggs,\r\nthis time being required in order that the eggs may develop in the\r\novaries of the butterflies. These eggs hatch in about a week and the\r\ncaterpillars become full grown a month later. They then change to\r\nchrysalids in which condition they remain another week, thus requiring\r\nfive or six weeks for the newly laid eggs to mature into butterflies.\r\nSupposing the eggs were laid the first week in June, the butterflies\r\nof this second brood would appear about the middle of July. The eggs\r\nin the ovaries of some of these butterflies also require several weeks\r\nbefore they are ready to be laid, so that it may be about the tenth of\r\nAugust when this happens. These hatch and mature to chrysalids during\r\nthe next six weeks, the butterflies of this brood emerging about the\r\nmiddle of September. These in turn lay eggs at once apparently, no\r\nextended period being required for their development before they are\r\nlaid. The eggs hatch during the latter part of September and the young\r\ncaterpillars feed upon the violet leaves for two or three weeks,\r\nmoulting perhaps twice and becoming approximately half grown. They now\r\nstop feeding and go into a lethargic condition in which they\r\nhibernate. Then in spring they awaken and feed again upon the violet\r\nleaves for a short time, becoming mature and changing to chrysalids\r\nsufficiently early to emerge as butterflies late in May.\r\n\r\nIn this hypothetical group we have a fairly normal condition of a\r\nthree-brooded butterfly hibernating in the stage of the half-grown\r\nlarva and requiring some weeks for the development of the eggs in the\r\novaries of the butterflies in the case of the first two broods but not\r\nof the third.\r\n\r\nIn another group, which we may designate as B, the conditions may be\r\nsimilar except that the butterflies lay their eggs very soon after\r\ncoming from the chrysalis in the case of all three broods. Obviously\r\nthere would be a tendency here for hastening the earliness of the\r\nbroods so that the hibernating caterpillars might either become larger\r\nor might go into the hibernating condition earlier than those of\r\nGroup A.\r\n\r\nIn Group C, the variation takes place in the larvae rather than in the\r\nbutterflies. These may go on in the normal way up to the time the\r\ncaterpillars of the summer brood become half grown. Then they become\r\nlethargic, ceasing to feed and to all appearances going into\r\nhibernation. They remain in this condition until the following spring\r\nwhen they come forth from their winter's sleep and feed upon the\r\nviolets in precisely the same way as the caterpillars of the third\r\nbrood of Groups A and B.\r\n\r\nIn Group D we have another interesting variation of the larvae. These\r\nare the same as C up to the time of becoming lethargic, that is, the\r\nlarvae of the summer or second brood become lethargic at the same time\r\nas those of Group C but instead of continuing in this condition until\r\nthe following spring they remain in lethargy only three or four weeks,\r\nthen they wake up (having apparently then changed their caterpillar\r\nminds) and begin to feed, soon maturing and changing to chrysalids\r\nfrom which butterflies emerge late in September or early in October.\r\nThe result is that these butterflies lay eggs so late that the cold\r\nnights come on apace and the little caterpillars apparently take no\r\nfood at all but go into hibernation immediately. In consequence these\r\nmust eat for a longer period the following spring, so that the\r\nbutterflies into which they mature will be likely not to appear until\r\nwell along in June.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that even this rather elaborate statement does not do\r\njustice to all the variations in the development of this little\r\nbutterfly. But perhaps enough has been said to help us to understand\r\nsomething of the way in which such insects are able to adapt their\r\nlife habits to the conditions of their environment. It is easy to see\r\nthat if conditions should so change as to give any one of these groups\r\na decided advantage over the others, the tendency would be for the\r\nother groups to disappear and for the group of favored habits to\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\nThe Meadow Fritillary is common in Canada and the Northern states east\r\nof the Rocky Mountains. It is found especially in lowland meadows and\r\nalong the borders of swamps, the very situations chosen by the food\r\nplants of the larva, the blue and the white violets. The butterflies\r\nmay be often seen sipping nectar from the various species of mint and\r\nrelated plants found in such situations. It is commonly associated\r\nwith the Silver-bordered Fritillary, from which it is easily\r\ndistinguished because it has no silver spots upon its wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Silver-bordered Fritillary=\r\n  _Brenthis myrina_\r\n\r\nThis attractive little butterfly bears a close general resemblance to\r\nthe Meadow Fritillary, from which it differs chiefly by the continuous\r\nrow of silver spots along the border of the under side of both pairs\r\nof wings. It is found in the same localities as the other and its\r\nlife-history is very similar.\r\n\r\nThe present species is widely distributed in North America, being\r\nfound as far west as the upper Mississippi Valley and the Rocky\r\nMountains, and southward as far as the Carolinas. In New England and\r\nthe Atlantic states it is one of the commonest of the smaller\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the butterflies which are seen in the fields and\r\nmeadows in September, the yearly cycle of this insect may be\r\nsummarized in this way: the eggs laid in September hatch in a few days\r\ninto tiny caterpillars, some of which become lethargic at once, while\r\nothers begin feeding upon the violet leaves and continue thus to feed\r\nuntil they are about half grown. These then also become lethargic and\r\nfind shelter just above the soil surface where they remain until the\r\nfollowing spring. They then begin to feed again upon the violet leaves\r\nand at about the same time the other caterpillars which became dormant\r\nas soon as hatched, also waken and feed upon these leaves. Naturally\r\nthose which were half grown at the beginning of spring are likely to\r\nmature and change to chrysalids two or three weeks earlier than those\r\nwhich were so small at the beginning of the season. Consequently the\r\nfresh butterflies will be found from late in May to the latter part of\r\nJune. Presumably those which first appeared have developed from the\r\nlarger caterpillars and the later ones from the smaller caterpillars.\r\n\r\nThe butterflies of this first brood of the season lay their eggs upon\r\nthe violet leaves, generally upon the upper surface of the blade, but\r\noccasionally upon the stems or upon near-by grasses. These eggs hatch\r\nin about a week into caterpillars that mature during the next three or\r\nfour weeks, coming forth as a second brood of butterflies late in July\r\nor early in August. These in like manner lay their eggs and develop\r\ninto a third brood which matures as butterflies in September. These\r\nlay eggs that hatch into the caterpillars which live through the\r\nwinter. There are thus three broods of butterflies during the year\r\nand it is probable that there is the same remarkable variation in the\r\nhabits of the different broods that have been found in the ease of the\r\nMeadow Fritillary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Fritillaries_\r\n\r\n_Gulf Fritillary_ (_Agraulis vanillae_). Expanse 2 3/4 inches. Apex of\r\neach front wing produced into a distinct angle. Upper surface of all\r\nwings reddish brown, marked with black spots and an interrupted black\r\nborder, the border on the hind wings enclosing round red-brown spots.\r\nUnder surface, so far as it shows when insect is at rest, nearly\r\ncovered with large silver-white spots. Found only in the more Southern\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n_Variegated Fritillary_ (_Euptoieta claudia_). Expanse 2 1/2 inches.\r\nApex of each front wing produced into a distinct angle. Upper surface\r\nof all wings fulvous brown, thickly marked with buff and brownish\r\nblack. A sub-marginal row of black dots on each of the wings, outside\r\nof which is a row of buff crescents on the blackish border. Under\r\nsurface, as it shows when the butterfly is at rest, beautifully\r\nmarbled in creamy browns and deeper browns. No distinct silver spots\r\nin either surface.\r\n\r\n_Diana Fritillary_ (_Argynnis diana_). _Male._ Expanse 3 1/2 inches.\r\nApex of fore wings rounded. Upper surface of all wings, with a little\r\nmore than basal half, solid brownish black and the rest of the surface\r\norange-brown, marked with darker brown round spots and vein lines.\r\nUnder surface light buff, marked with black, with silver crescents and\r\nspots on hind wings. _Female._ Expanse 4 inches. Upper surface of all\r\nwings blackish with bluish or greenish iridescence, and marginal third\r\nmarked with blue spots and stripes. These are more prominent on the\r\nhind wings. Under surface slaty brown with prominent silver crescents\r\non the hind wings.\r\n\r\n_Idalia or Regal Fritillary_ (_Argynnis idalia_). _Male._ Expanse 3\r\ninches. Front wings fulvous brown with black spots and markings. Hind\r\nwings black except at base with a row of fulvous brown sub-marginal\r\nspots and an inner row of whitish or bluish white spots. _Female._\r\nExpanse 3 1/2 inches. Similar to male except for larger size and the\r\nfact that the two rows of spots on the hind wings are yellowish brown.\r\n\r\n_Great Spangled Fritillary_ (_Argynnis cybele_). Expanse 3 1/4 inches.\r\nGeneral color of wings fulvous brown with black markings on upper\r\nsurface and black and silver markings on under surface. The yellow\r\nband between the rows of silver spots on hind wings is broad. There is\r\na distinct narrow fulvous stripe on the upper side of the hind wing\r\njust inside the outer margin, and a similar stripe along the margin of\r\nthe front wing, more or less interrupted by the veins.\r\n\r\n_Silver-spot Fritillary_ (_Argynnis aphrodite_). Expanse 3 inches.\r\nSimilar to the Great Spangled but a little smaller, and with the buff\r\nyellow band between the rows of silver spots on the lower surface much\r\nnarrower and almost disappearing at the rear.\r\n\r\n_Mountain Silver-spot_ (_Argynnis atlantis_). Expanse 2 1/4 inches.\r\nKnown by its smaller size and the black marginal border stripe on all\r\nthe wings, with no brown line dividing this stripe.\r\n\r\n_Silver-bordered Fritillary_ (_Brenthis myrina_). Expanse 1 3/4\r\ninches. Known by its small size and a marginal row of silver spots on\r\nthe under side of each of the wings, and with many other silver spots\r\nscattered over the under surface of the hind wings.\r\n\r\n_Meadow Fritillary_ (_Brenthis bellona_). Expanse 2 inches. Easily\r\nknown by the absence of silver spots on all the wings. The wings are\r\nlong in proportion to their width.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE CRESCENT-SPOTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of this tribe have the following combinations of\r\ncharacters: scaly antennae, with a short stout club some three times\r\nas long as broad, and a pair of slender palpi in which the terminal\r\njoint is only about half as long as the middle one. There may or may\r\nnot be a slight ridge running lengthwise of the naked part of the\r\nantennal club.\r\n\r\nAlthough more than fifty distinct species belonging to this tribe have\r\nbeen found in North America, very few of these are distributed through\r\nthe eastern part. Only four are so abundant and widely distributed\r\nthat they need be treated of here.\r\n\r\n\r\n =Baltimore Checker-spot=\r\n  _Euphydryas phaeton_\r\n\r\nTo the naturalist those islands in the seas which are remote from the\r\nmainland have long been of especial interest. The life upon them is\r\nlikely to show the results of many generations of living under unique\r\nconditions. The plants and animals are generally distinctive, many of\r\nthe species having characteristics which differentiate them markedly\r\nfrom those upon the mainland. They show in a thousand ways the effect\r\nof isolation and so are of especial value when one attempts to\r\ndetermine the results of unusual conditions upon living things.\r\n\r\nIn a somewhat similar way the peat bogs or sphagnum swamps which occur\r\nhere and there over a large part of North America are of especial\r\ninterest, because in a way they are biological islands in which the\r\nconditions of a long past age are preserved until the present. These\r\nnearly always occur in a little valley surrounded on all sides by\r\nhills. Here the water has collected originally into a pond or lake,\r\nwhich has been gradually filling up through the growth of peat mosses\r\nand a special set of other plants that develop in such situations. One\r\ncan still find many stages in the process. In some bogs the surface\r\nwill be practically covered, although the water beneath may still be\r\nso abundant that the matted moss quakes as one walks over it.\r\nSometimes such bogs are really dangerous because the walker may drop\r\nthrough to the water beneath. In most of the bogs, however, the little\r\nlake is nearly filled but shows the surface over a small area.\r\n\r\nThe conditions in these peat bogs have changed little since\r\ncivilization began. They are relics of an earlier era which have come\r\ndown to us as types of conditions that once existed very generally.\r\nThe plant life is unique and consists almost entirely of forms which\r\nare found practically nowhere else. There are comparatively few\r\nanimals living in these peat bogs and all of these are likely to be of\r\nespecial interest. Among the insects none is more remarkable than the\r\nBaltimore Checker-spot butterfly which has several peculiarities that\r\ndifferentiate it from the other members of the group. It seems to have\r\ncome down to us unchanged from a far remote past and to be living its\r\ntranquil life to-day in precisely the same manner as during the time\r\nwhen the mammoth and the mastodon were likely to invade its haunts.\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore is probably the most local in its distribution of any of\r\nthe butterflies found throughout Canada and the Northern states. It is\r\nto be looked for only in peat bogs and swamps, and it has a remarkable\r\nunity in its life-history whether it be found in northern Canada or as\r\nfar south as West Virginia. The butterfly itself is rather large,\r\nmeasuring a little more than two inches across its expanded wings and\r\nbeing colored with an unusual combination of fulvous and yellow upon a\r\nblack background. It is present as a rule only from about the first of\r\nJune to the middle of July. The eggs, in bunches of from one hundred\r\nto four hundred, are laid upon the leaves of the plant commonly called\r\nsnake-head or turtle-head (_Chelone glabra_). They do not hatch for\r\nnearly three weeks; then the little caterpillars emerge together and\r\nusually each eats a little of the empty egg shell. They are then\r\nlikely to form a thin web over the under surface of the leaf beneath\r\nwhich they remain as a small company feeding upon the succulent green\r\ntissue. A little later they are likely to begin the construction of a\r\nminiature nest by spinning a silken web over the young leaves at the\r\ntop of the plant. From this time on this silken nest serves as their\r\nhome, and they utilize it almost as effectively as do our familiar\r\nAmerican tent caterpillars the nest which they make in the forks of\r\nthe wild cherry tree. The Baltimore caterpillars often wander more or\r\nless from their tent-like home but they generally come back to feed as\r\nwell as to moult. If the nest is injured by wind or rain, all the\r\ncaterpillars turn out to repair it and as the need for new food\r\nsupplies arises they also unite to enlarge the tent. This habit of\r\nworking together for the common good is very suggestive of the similar\r\nhabits of the American tent caterpillars. Doors for going in and out\r\nare left in the tent during its construction.\r\n\r\nThe tent thus made is likely to be deserted after the first moult and\r\na new and larger one constructed on another part of the plant. Two or\r\nperhaps three such nests may be made from the time the caterpillar\r\nhatches until after the second moult. The last nest made is very\r\nlikely to be upon some neighboring bushy plant or at least to include\r\nsome branches of such a plant if the bulk of the nest is made upon\r\nsnake-head. For after the third moult the caterpillars stop feeding\r\nand become more or less quiet, thus beginning a nine months' fast,\r\nduring which they are simply to wait until the return of spring. This\r\nfast may be begun any time from the middle of August until early in\r\nSeptember, and even when brought indoors the caterpillars cannot be\r\ninduced to eat. It is evidently the way in which the species has\r\nbridged over the winter during the thousands of generations of its\r\nexistence, and the instinct is so firmly fixed that it cannot be\r\nchanged. Even in West Virginia, where the caterpillars would have\r\nplenty of time during the summer to mature as butterflies that would\r\nbring forth another generation of caterpillars that might pass the\r\nwinter, the condition is the same as in the far northern regions.\r\n\r\nSo within the shelter of the silken nest these Baltimore caterpillars\r\nremain from the middle of August until May. Then when the spring\r\nsunshine has sufficiently warmed their cool retreats they come forth\r\nand feed greedily upon the young leaves. They now soon make up for\r\nlost time and complete their growth as caterpillars very quickly.\r\nWhen full fed they wander about in all directions, each hunting its\r\nown shelter before becoming a chrysalis. Having found a twig or branch\r\nthat suits their purpose each hangs downward and changes to a brownish\r\nyellow chrysalis, more or less marked with black. It remains in this\r\ncondition for about a fortnight, when it comes forth as the Baltimore\r\nbutterfly which thus appears again about the first of June.\r\n\r\nThese butterflies seem to have some of the characteristics of their\r\nunique surroundings. There are very few flowers in the peat bogs and\r\nit is significant that the butterflies instead of flitting from flower\r\nto flower, as do most of our familiar species, fly rather in a slow\r\nand lazy fashion from leaf to leaf, lighting upon the foliage or\r\nfrequently upon the surface of the moss or ground. They seem lethargic\r\nand have little of the animation which we usually associate with the\r\nname butterfly.\r\n\r\nIn my mind the Baltimore is associated with the White Mountain\r\nbutterfly as a survivor of a former geologic period. The latter was\r\ndeveloped under colder conditions and now survives only on a few\r\nisolated mountain peaks; but the former has survived wherever the peat\r\nbog has held its sway during the long ages that the surrounding\r\nlandscape has been taking on its present-day condition. Many things in\r\nthe life of the Baltimore point to its primitive condition: the laying\r\nof the eggs in loose clusters, the long lethargy of the caterpillars,\r\nthe limited flight of the butterflies--all indicate a creature with\r\nhabits firmly fixed by long ages of development in a definite\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nNo collector should feel sure that the Baltimore is not to be one of\r\nhis trophies until he has visited in June every peat bog or sphagnum\r\nswamp in his locality. One may search years without finding it, and\r\nthen come across a dozen in a single day. I well remember the interest\r\nwith which I first found this species on the margin of a great swamp\r\nin Michigan when I was eager for every new butterfly to add to my\r\ncollection. I had never seen it alive before and the thrill with which\r\nthe first specimen was captured can be realized only by those\r\nremembering similar experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n =Harris's Checker-spot=\r\n  _Cinclidia harrisii_\r\n\r\nThis little butterfly so closely resembles the Pearl Crescent and the\r\nSilver Crescent that on the wing it is easily mistaken for them. It\r\nreally looks more like them than it does the Baltimore Checker-spot,\r\nwhich is considerably larger and darker colored than the present\r\nspecies. This is essentially a northern form occurring only in a\r\nnarrow strip of country east of Minnesota and Wisconsin, running on\r\nthe north through southern Canada and on the south through Michigan,\r\nNew York, and Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThis insect is one of the best-known botanists among all the\r\nbutterflies. In the very difficult group of asters which has caused\r\nendless confusion to human botanists these insects seem always able to\r\nselect the one species--_Aster umbellatus_. It has been repeatedly\r\nfound that the caterpillars would starve rather than eat the leaves of\r\nother kinds of asters, and so far as known they have never been found\r\nfeeding outdoors upon any other.\r\n\r\nThese butterflies appear along roadsides and in open fields about the\r\nmiddle of June. They are often very abundant and are much more\r\ngenerally distributed than the Baltimore Checker-spot. A few weeks\r\nlater the females lay their eggs upon the aster leaves, the eggs being\r\ndeposited in clusters of twenty or more on the under side of the leaf.\r\nEarly in July the little caterpillars come forth and remain together\r\nin colonies as they feed upon the green tissues of the leaves. Each is\r\nable to spin a silken thread so that wherever they go they weave a web\r\nand they soon protect themselves with a slight silken shelter, which\r\nis suggestive of the nests made by the Baltimore caterpillar. They\r\ncontinue to live in this manner for several weeks in July and August,\r\ngrowing rather gradually and becoming approximately half grown before\r\nthe frosts of autumn. Unlike the Baltimore caterpillars they now\r\ndesert their nests and find shelter at or near the surface of the\r\nground. Here they hibernate, to come forth the following spring and\r\nfeed again upon the new growth of the aster plants, often doing\r\nconsiderable damage by denuding the young shoots of their leaves. They\r\nbecome full grown in time to change to chrysalids so that the\r\nbutterflies may emerge in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Silver Crescent=\r\n  _Charidryas nycteis_\r\n\r\nWhile this species has not the broad distribution for which the Pearl\r\nCrescent is notable it occurs over a large part of the United States.\r\nIts distribution is bounded broadly by a line running from southern\r\nCanada north of Maine to a point in southern Canada north of Montana,\r\nwhence it runs south through Wyoming and Utah to the corner of\r\nArizona, and thence east through New Mexico and Texas to Ohio and West\r\nVirginia, extending south near the coast to North Carolina. It thus\r\nincludes a broad belt of territory occupying fully one half of the\r\narea of the United States.\r\n\r\nThroughout this vast area the Silver Crescent is often a purely local\r\nspecies, occurring abundantly during its brief season in some\r\nfavorable locality but seldom being seen in other places near by. In\r\nthe north it is single-brooded, the butterflies appearing on the wing\r\nduring June and commonly disappearing early in July. Late in June the\r\nfemales lay their eggs in clusters of a hundred or less on the under\r\nsurface of the leaves of various composite plants, notably sunflowers,\r\nasters, and a common species of Actinomeris. A week or more later\r\nthese hatch into little caterpillars that feed together in colonies\r\nupon the green tissues of the leaf, taking only the succulent\r\nparenchyma and leaving the network of veins. As one leaf is thus\r\ndenuded they migrate to another, in this way passing from leaf to leaf\r\nfor several weeks in summer. They continue to feed until about half\r\ngrown when they desert the food plant and find shelter at the soil\r\nsurface. Here they become lethargic and hibernate until the following\r\nspring. They then arouse again and feed upon the tender leaves of the\r\nnew growth, continuing to eat and grow for a few weeks before they\r\nbecome mature as caterpillars and change to chrysalids. A little later\r\nthe chrysalids disclose the butterflies which as already indicated\r\nappear in June.\r\n\r\nIn more southern regions the life-story of the species is not so\r\nsimple. There is at least a partial second brood and it is probable\r\nthat in many localities the species is both single-brooded and\r\ndouble-brooded. In such a case some of the caterpillars go into\r\nhibernation probably about midsummer, remaining quiescent through the\r\nlater weeks of summer and all the weeks of fall and winter, while\r\nothers would mature to chrysalids and butterflies in summer, and the\r\nbutterflies would lay eggs for a second brood of larvae which would\r\nhibernate when partially grown. There are opportunities for careful\r\nobservers to do good work upon the life-history of this species in\r\nmany parts of its range.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Pearl Crescent=\r\n  _Phyciodes tharos_\r\n\r\nSome years ago Mr. Samuel H. Scudder, the most notable student of New\r\nEngland butterflies, wrote a delightful essay with the title\r\n\"Butterflies as Botanists.\" From his long experience in rearing the\r\neggs of these insects he concluded that the egg-laying females know in\r\na most remarkable way the precise kinds of leaves upon which to\r\noviposit. He educed many illustrations in proof of the fact and quoted\r\na remark of Asa Gray, the most eminent of American botanists, that is\r\nworth repeating. At that time Scudder had reason to believe that the\r\nPearl Crescent laid its eggs exclusively upon the New England aster.\r\nNow the asters as a group have been a source of much trouble to the\r\nbotanists who have attempted to classify them as to species and\r\nvariety. The various forms are so similar to one another that\r\ndifferent authorities have not agreed as to the limitations of the\r\nspecies. So when Gray was told that this little butterfly was able\r\nalways to distinguish and select for her egg-laying a single species\r\nof this vexing tribe he replied: \"If your butterfly selects only that,\r\nit is a better botanist than most of us.\"\r\n\r\nWhile later observers have found that this beautiful little insect is\r\nnot so exclusive in its choice of a food plant as was formerly\r\nbelieved, it serves to illustrate the fact that a large proportion of\r\nthe caterpillars of this group have a very narrow range of food\r\nplants. In nearly every case where the food is thus restricted the\r\ninsect feeds only upon species which are closely related to one\r\nanother, generally falling within a single genus according to the\r\nclassification of the botanists.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion in regard to the way in which the\r\nmother butterfly knows the particular species which she chooses for\r\noviposition. Experiments apparently have shown that she is not\r\ndependent upon the sense of sight but rather upon the sense of smell,\r\nwhich as is well known is much more highly developed in insects than\r\nin the higher animals. I suppose it is not very strange that a\r\ncreature which has fed from infancy upon leaves with a certain taste\r\nand odor should in its later life respond only to that particular odor\r\nand should neglect all others. In a way the butterfly itself is a\r\nproduct of the plant and it probably is not necessary to assume that\r\neach butterfly differentiates the odors of all kinds of plants but\r\nonly that she responds to the fragrance of the one with which she has\r\nbeen particularly associated.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by Mary E. Walker_   _See page 153_\r\n\r\n     THE HOP MERCHANT\r\n       Caterpillar, chrysalis, and butterflies. (Reduced)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Mourning-Cloak\r\n                                                 _See pages 112, 171_]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: The Viceroy visiting wild carrot flowers\r\n                                                        _See page 195_\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLES OF FOUR-FOOTED BUTTERFLIES SHOWING USE OF THE FOUR LEGS\r\n       (Photographed from life)]\r\n\r\nThis idea may suggest to various observers an interesting point of\r\nview. When you see a butterfly flying leisurely from plant to plant\r\nand alighting upon the leaves rather than the blossom, you may be\r\npretty sure that she is bent upon egg-laying. Now watch her to see if\r\nshe goes at once to the particular kind of leaves she finally selects\r\nor does she stop momentarily upon neighboring plants, apparently\r\ntrying to find the one from which the fragrance emanates until at last\r\nshe reaches it. Such observations have only rarely been recorded and\r\nif carefully made, notes being taken on the spot, they would have\r\ndecided scientific value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abundance and Distribution_\r\n\r\nFew butterflies are more abundant or more widely distributed\r\nthroughout North America than the beautiful little Pearl Crescent. It\r\noccurs over practically the whole of the United States and Canada and\r\nis found from early in spring until late in autumn. It is a rather\r\nsmall species with a wing expanse of only about an inch and a quarter,\r\nthe upper surface of the wings being that tone of reddish brown called\r\nfulvous, more or less marked with black wavy lines and dots. The under\r\nsurface is similar in color, with a small silver crescent near the\r\nouter margin of each hind wing.\r\n\r\nThese butterflies are not very active creatures, although they are\r\ncommonly found in meadows and pastures along brooks and by the borders\r\nof open woods. Instead of laying their eggs singly as do so many of\r\nthe more active butterflies, they lay them in clusters, often of a\r\nhundred or more, one layer of eggs being placed above the other upon\r\nthe aster leaf. In at least one case observed, the caterpillars hatch\r\nfrom the layer farthest away from the leaf surface before those of the\r\nlayer next the leaf surface emerge. This is an interesting provision,\r\nfor were the latter to come out first they would be likely to\r\ndisarrange the unhatched eggs. The caterpillars appear about a week\r\nafter the eggs are laid and remain together in crowded colonies that\r\nfeed upon the upper surface of the aster leaf. At first they eat only\r\nthe green tissue, leaving the bare veins, although they are not\r\ncareful to denude the entire surface of the leaf as so many other\r\ncaterpillars do. As one leaf is exhausted they pass to another near\r\nby, continuing thus to feed in companies for a few weeks. Their\r\ngeneral color is blackish, although the black is relieved with yellow\r\ndots along the back and a band of a similar color on each side. Unlike\r\nthe larger social caterpillars of the Mourning Cloak and other\r\nbutterflies these larvae do not spin any threads as they crawl from\r\nplace to place, so there is absolutely no nest made upon the aster\r\nleaf. This may possibly be correlated with the fact that these\r\ncaterpillars are sluggish creatures and when disturbed drop quickly to\r\nthe soil beneath.\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillars are full grown, they fall or crawl to the ground\r\nand scatter more or less in search of shelter. Each attaches itself to\r\nany protection it may have found and changes to a grayish or brownish\r\nchrysalis more or less angular. It remains in this condition for a\r\nperiod that varies greatly with the weather conditions, averaging\r\nabout two weeks.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct forms of these butterflies which vary so\r\ngreatly that they were once considered separate species. They are now\r\nknown, however, to be only seasonal variations. In New England two\r\nbroods of the insect occur, one in spring, the other in summer. The\r\nspring form is called technically _Phyciodes tharos tharos_. In this\r\nform the under surface of the hind wings is very distinctly marked\r\nwith blackish spots. The summer form is called _Phyciodes tharos\r\nmorpheus_. It is noticeably larger than the spring form and it has\r\nvery few markings on the under surface of the hind wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Yearly History_\r\n\r\nAs it occurs in New England the yearly history of this little\r\nbutterfly runs something like this. The spring form of the adult\r\nappears in May and lays eggs upon the aster leaves. These eggs hatch\r\ninto caterpillars that feed upon the aster leaves for several weeks\r\nand then change to chrysalids, remaining in the latter stage ten days\r\nor two weeks. They then come from the chrysalids in the form of the\r\nsummer butterflies which begin to appear about the middle of July and\r\ncontinue to emerge for at least a month. These lay eggs upon the aster\r\nleaves again and the little caterpillars that hatch from them feed for\r\na few weeks or until about the last of September. They are then only\r\npartially grown, but they make no attempt to complete their\r\ntransformation at this time. Instead they drop to the ground and go\r\ninto hibernation, remaining in this condition until early the\r\nfollowing spring. They then begin feeding again and complete their\r\ndevelopment in time to emerge as the spring form of the butterfly in\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nSome very interesting experiments by William H. Edwards have shown\r\nthat the smaller, darker spring form of the butterfly is due to cold.\r\nHe placed upon ice chrysalids that would normally produce the summer\r\nform and found that the specimens so treated produced the spring form.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is one of the best known examples of the variation in\r\nthe yearly cycle due to differences in latitude. This is readily shown\r\nby a brief summary of its life-history, from north to south.\r\n\r\nIn the far northern climate of Labrador there is but one brood a year\r\nand the butterflies belong to what I have been calling the spring\r\nform. The butterflies appear on the wing in early summer, lay their\r\neggs upon the aster leaves, and die. The eggs hatch into caterpillars\r\nthat feed for several weeks, then become dormant and remain in such\r\nshelters as they can find until the following spring. They then change\r\nto chrysalids to emerge as butterflies a little later. There is thus\r\nbut one brood a year and the only form of the butterfly is the small,\r\ndarker colored variety.\r\n\r\nAs far south as southern Canada there is a slight variation in this\r\nyearly cycle. The spring form of the butterflies appears in May and\r\nlays eggs. The eggs hatch into caterpillars; part of these\r\ncaterpillars mature within a few weeks, change to chrysalids, and come\r\nout in July or August as the larger summer form of the butterfly,\r\nwhich in turn lays eggs for the caterpillars that are to winter over\r\nin a dormant condition and mature the following season. But the\r\nsignificant fact is that not all of the caterpillars which thus have\r\nhatched in spring go through this cycle. Part of them become dormant\r\nwhen partially grown and continue dormant through summer, autumn, and\r\nwinter, just as they did in Labrador. Then in spring they develop into\r\nthe spring form of the butterfly, along with the caterpillars that\r\nhave hatched from the eggs laid in summer. There is thus what is\r\ncalled an overlapping of the broods.\r\n\r\nFarther south, in southern New England, the life-history is more\r\ndefinitely two-brooded each year, as already described in an earlier\r\nparagraph. Still farther south, in the region of the Virginias, it is\r\ndefinitely three-brooded, there being at least two summer broods\r\nduring the year. How is it that the instinct to become lethargic lies\r\ndormant in the summer broods of caterpillars and shows itself only in\r\nthe autumn brood? Is it perhaps due to a reaction to the colder nights\r\nof the later season? If so, possibly one could get interesting light\r\nupon the subject by experimenting with placing the summer caterpillars\r\ntemporarily in an ice chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Crescent-spots_\r\n\r\n_Baltimore Checker-spot_ (_Euphydryas phaeton_ or _Melitaea phaeton_).\r\nExpanse 1 3/4 inches. General color purplish black with the upper\r\nsurface marked thus: a marginal row of red-brown spots between the\r\nveins; two rows of creamy yellow spots inside of the row just\r\nmentioned; two or three small red and two or three small white spots\r\nnear front border of each front wing. Under surface checkered in\r\nred-brown and creamy yellow on a blackish background.\r\n\r\n_Harris's Checker-spot_ (_Cinclidia harrisii_ or _Melitaea harrisii_).\r\nExpanse 1 3/4 inches. This species bears a close general resemblance\r\nto the Silver Crescent. It may be distinguished by the fact that the\r\nmiddle joint of each palpus is of uniform size from end to end instead\r\nof tapering toward its outer end. The tibial joint of the first pair\r\nof legs of the male butterfly is very thick. The upper wing surface is\r\nso marked with black that the tawny red coloring shows only in the\r\nmiddle.\r\n\r\n_Silver Crescent_ (_Charidryas nycteis_, _Melitaea nycteis_ or\r\n_Phyciodes nycteis_). Expanse 1 3/4 inches. This species may be known\r\nfrom Harris's Checker-spot by the fact that the middle joint of each\r\npalpus tapers from the middle to the tip and that the tibia of each\r\nfront leg in the male is slender rather than stout. On the lower\r\nsurface of the wings there is a narrow yellowish marginal line.\r\n\r\n_Pearl Crescent_ (_Phyciodes tharos_ or _Melitaea tharos_). Expanse\r\n1 1/2 inches. General color much lighter than either of the preceding.\r\nTerminal joint of each palpus less than a third as long as the middle\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE ANGLE-WINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe special characteristic that distinguishes the members of this\r\nimportant group from the other Nymphs is the fact that on that portion\r\nof the club of each antenna which has not hairs there are three\r\nlongitudinal ridges. The tribe includes a large number of our most\r\nfamiliar butterflies. Nearly all of them are rather large, with bright\r\nattractive colors. They fly freely along roadsides and in orchards,\r\nfields, and meadows so they are commonly seen by every one.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Violet-tip=\r\n  _Polygonia interrogationis_\r\n\r\nThe Violet-tip is one of the largest of the Angle-wings, as well as\r\none of the most beautiful of all our species. It has a wonderful\r\nviolet iridescence which is especially marked on the projecting tip of\r\nthe hind wing. On fresh specimens, however, it may be seen practically\r\nall over both surfaces of the wings and in bright sunlight gives them\r\na sheen of remarkable beauty. The expanded wings measure nearly two\r\nand a half inches, the upper surface being marked with dark brown\r\nupon a ground of orange-brown. The under surface has a bark-like\r\neffect in brownish gray brought about by rather indefinite markings of\r\nvarying tone. The most characteristic feature is a distinct silver\r\nsemicolon on the middle of the under surface of each hind wing. This\r\nmarking closely resembles the Greek interrogation point and so the\r\nspecies was given the specific name _interrogationis_ by Fabricius\r\nearly in the history of science. It has since often been called the\r\ninterrogation butterfly as a translation of its Latin name, but in as\r\nmuch as the marking on the wings is not at all like the English\r\ninterrogation point, this has led to considerable confusion and people\r\nhave considered it a misnomer. It has also been called the Semicolon\r\nbutterfly which is correct enough so far as this most characteristic\r\nfeature is concerned; but it leads to confusion in connection with the\r\nLatin name. The recent practice seems the better, which is to call it\r\nthe Violet-tip butterfly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Life-history_\r\n\r\nThe life-history of this butterfly is much like that of the related\r\nspecies. Briefly summarized, this is its story:\r\n\r\nThe adult butterflies, more or less worn and faded from their long\r\nhibernation, appear in fields and pastures in May. They fly for\r\nseveral weeks sipping nectar from many kinds of spring flowers. The\r\nfemales search for the leaves of the elm, hop, nettle, false nettle,\r\nand perhaps other related plants on which they deposit their ribbed\r\neggs either singly or in small groups, it often happening that one egg\r\nwill be laid directly on top of another. About a week later the eggs\r\nhatch into small spinose caterpillars which begin feeding upon the\r\nleaves near by. They continue to feed and grow rather rapidly until\r\nthey become full size. Each then fastens a bit of pink silk to the\r\nstem of the plant or some other support, in which it entangles its\r\nhind legs and hangs downward to become a chrysalis which is remarkable\r\nfor its numerous protuberances and the beautiful silvery and golden\r\nspots along the middle of the back. Within these chrysalids the change\r\nfrom larva to butterfly takes place, usually in less than two weeks,\r\nso that this new brood of adults appears on the wing early in July.\r\nEggs are laid by these for a second brood of caterpillars that feed\r\nupon the host plants in the same way as the others, and mature as\r\nbutterflies late in August or early in September. These butterflies\r\nvisit the fall flowers and suck the juices of fallen fruits, until the\r\ncold weather of autumn warns them to seek shelter for the winter. They\r\nnow find crevices within the bark of trees or places in hollow logs or\r\nstone piles or other similar situations, where they close their wings\r\ntogether, so that only the bark-like under surface shows, and remain\r\nquiet for long periods. They hibernate in this way, coming forth again\r\nthe following season to start the cycle for the new year.\r\n\r\nIn regions where hops are grown commercially the chrysalids of these\r\nbutterflies are often called \"hop merchants.\" There is a quaint fancy\r\nthat the price of the crop varies with the lustre of the golden spots\r\nupon the chrysalids. When these stand out conspicuously, according to\r\nthis fancy, the hops are to sell high--bringing much gold to the\r\nowners. When these are inconspicuous the hops are to sell at a low\r\nprice, with a corresponding diminution in the returns. But this fancy\r\ndoes not apply at all to the chrysalids when they are nearly ready to\r\ndisclose the butterfly, for at this time they lose their metallic\r\nlustre.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Hop Merchant or Comma=\r\n  _Polygonia comma_\r\n\r\nThere are two species of butterflies which commonly lay their eggs\r\nupon the hop and which resemble each other so closely in their earlier\r\nstages that they are frequently confused by ordinary observers. One is\r\nthe Violet-tip or Semicolon and the other is the one which has long\r\nbeen called the Comma. The chrysalids of both are marked in silver and\r\ngold and the variation in the golden lustre has led hop growers to\r\ndeduce from them the probable price of hops. On this account the\r\nchrysalids are commonly called Hop Merchants and the name has been\r\ntransferred to the butterflies themselves. (_See plate, page 144._)\r\n\r\nThe Comma is easily distinguished by the conspicuous silver mark in\r\nthe middle of the under side of each hind wing. This bears a striking\r\nresemblance to a comma, hence the name. The butterflies are somewhat\r\nsmaller than the Violet-tips and show to a remarkable degree the\r\nangularity in the borders of the wings. The under side is cleverly\r\nmarked in imitation of the bark of trees, which is doubtless of much\r\nbenefit to the species in eluding observation during the long months\r\nfrom October until April, when the butterflies are hibernating in such\r\nconcealed shelter as each happens to find. The crevices beneath loose\r\nbark, the openings in fallen logs and hollow trees, the interspaces in\r\nstone piles, as well as the interior of buildings, all serve this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nLike the other over-wintering butterflies, the specimens that come\r\nforth in spring are commonly faded and more or less frayed from their\r\nlong wait since bursting forth from the chrysalis. They may often be\r\nseen sunning themselves on bright days in April and May, resting upon\r\nstones or logs in sheltered spots with their wings fully expanded to\r\nreceive the greatest benefit from the rays of sunshine.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Eggs laid in string-like clusters on the under\r\n     side of leaf. Magnified. (From Holland)]\r\n\r\nWhen spring has sufficiently advanced for the leaves of the elm and\r\nthe hop to be fairly well developed, the mother butterflies lay their\r\neggs in a curious and characteristic fashion. Under a lens these eggs\r\nlook like tiny barrels with vertical ribs. They are deposited in\r\ncolumns, the egg first extruded being attached to the leaf, generally\r\nthe under surface, and those which follow are placed one upon the\r\nother sometimes to the number of six or eight, the group thus making a\r\nminiature column. Now if the egg which was first laid should hatch\r\nbefore the others, when the little caterpillar came out it would be\r\nvery likely to cause the others to fall off and when they hatched they\r\nwould find themselves in what would be to them an impenetrable forest\r\nof weeds and grasses from which there would be small chance to escape\r\nto reach the elm or hop leaves. To avoid this calamity we find an\r\ninteresting adaptation. The egg at the end of the column hatches\r\nfirst, although it was necessarily the one laid last. The tiny\r\ncaterpillar eats its way out of the shell and crawls over the other\r\neggs to the leaf. Then the others hatch in succession.\r\n\r\nThe eggs thus deposited by the hibernating butterflies are likely to\r\nbe laid late in May or even early in June. They hatch into\r\ncaterpillars less than a week later and these caterpillars feed for\r\nabout a month, when they change to the characteristic chrysalids in\r\nwhich they commonly remain for a week or ten days. They then emerge as\r\nthe summer brood of butterflies, most of them in New England appearing\r\nduring July. These remain upon the wing for several weeks, the females\r\nlaying their eggs upon the elm and hop leaves. These in turn soon\r\nhatch into caterpillars that change to chrysalids in August and emerge\r\nas butterflies late that month or during September. This autumn brood\r\nof butterflies is quite abundant for a time but soon seeks the\r\nseclusion of winter quarters to remain until the following April.\r\nThere are thus two distinct broods during the year in the Northern\r\nstates while as far south as West Virginia there are likely to be\r\nthree broods.\r\n\r\nThese caterpillars at first simply eat small holes in the green\r\nsubstance of the leaf, but as they become larger each takes up its\r\nabode on the under surface of a single leaf and makes a sheltered tent\r\nin somewhat the same fashion that the Painted Lady does upon the\r\nnettle leaf. The caterpillar eats out more or less of the base of the\r\nblade on each side of the midrib, thus weakening the edges so that\r\nthey can be fastened in a tent-like manner by silken threads. This\r\nserves as a resting place from which it sallies forth to feed,\r\ncommonly only toward the tip of the leaf. As a result it often eats\r\nitself out of house and home and has to crawl to another leaf and\r\nconstruct a new shelter.\r\n\r\nWhile the Comma is generally spoken of as a characteristic northern\r\nspecies it has a very wide range, being found from New England to\r\nTexas and from the Northwestern states to the Carolinas. It is one of\r\nthose species which have two distinct forms of coloring. The winter\r\nform has been given the variety name _harrisii_. The butterflies of\r\nthis brood are decidedly lighter in color than those of the summer\r\nbrood to which the variety name _dryas_ has been given. The latter was\r\noriginally described as a distinct species by W. H. Edwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Change to the Chrysalis_\r\n\r\nThe manner in which a larva changes to a chrysalis is second in\r\ninterest only to that in which a chrysalis changes to a butterfly.\r\nThere are not a great many careful descriptions by competent observers\r\nof this process in print. One of the best of these is that by W. H.\r\nEdwards in his splendid work on \"The Butterflies of North America,\" in\r\nwhich he describes the transformation of the Comma caterpillar. It is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"When about to transform, the caterpillar selects a convenient place\r\non the under side of a projecting rock, or of a fence rail, or of a\r\nweather board of the house, or the midrib of a hop leaf, and having\r\nspun a little button of pale red silk fixes the hooks of its hind legs\r\ntherein and hangs suspended, head downward, in the shape of a fishhook\r\nand remains immovable for the space of twenty-four hours, no change\r\nbeing perceptible except in the color of the skin, which becomes\r\npartly transparent and loses its dark color owing to its gradual\r\nparting from the chrysalis within. Suddenly, and to a looker-on\r\nwithout any premonitory symptom, a rent takes place in the skin at the\r\nback of the head, just wide enough to allow the passage of the\r\nchrysalis, the head of which at once emerges. By a rapid contraction\r\nand expansion of the folds of the abdomen the larva draws the skin\r\nupward, successively discovering the parts of the fully formed\r\nchrysalid until at last, and in scarcely more than one minute of time,\r\nthe entire skin is gathered about the hind feet. It now bends itself\r\nviolently to disengage the end of the chrysalis, which is long,\r\npointed, and hard, furnished with several little hooks, meanwhile\r\nretaining its hold of the skin by the folds of its abdomen until after\r\na severe effort, convulsively reaching out and feeling in all\r\ndirections for the object of its search, it touches the button of silk\r\nand at once grasps it with its hooks and fixes them in it securely.\r\nThen by a twisting motion it manages to disengage the loose skin which\r\nfalls to the ground and the chrysalis rests. The whole process is most\r\ninteresting to witness and excites renewed wonder with every\r\nrepetition at the ingenuity of the means employed and the delicacy of\r\nthe instinct displayed. How to strip off the skin and much more the\r\nlegs by which the creature is suspended without losing its hold, and\r\nat the same time to securely fasten the chrysalis, is a problem that\r\nwould seem impossible to solve; and yet this little insect\r\naccomplishes it unerringly when to fail would be certain destruction.\r\nAnd not this species only, but the larvae of all butterflies which\r\nform suspended chrysalids, embracing the whole of the great family of\r\nNymphalidae, that is, a large proportion of all the existing species\r\nof butterflies, undergo a similar transformation.\r\n\r\n\"The chrysalis is now green in color, soft and indefensible,\r\nsusceptible to the slightest injury, and for a few moments the several\r\nparts of the future butterfly may be seen and readily separated; the\r\nwings folded close and enveloping the thorax, the antennae, and\r\nproboscis stretched at length along the back; but very speedily a\r\ncomplete casing is formed by the exuding from parts of the body of a\r\nviscous fluid, which binds together the tender parts and covers the\r\nwhole with a coating like varnish. This soon hardens and the chrysalis\r\nis ready to take its chance against injury.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Gray Comma=\r\n  _Polygonia progne_\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is rather darker colored, especially on its under side,\r\nthan the one last discussed. The silver marking takes on a little more\r\ndefinitely the form of an L than a comma, and the under surface of the\r\nwings is darkened by many blackish threadlike lines running across the\r\nveins. When at rest with wings closed these butterflies are very\r\neasily overlooked.\r\n\r\nExcept for a difference in the food plants of the caterpillar, the\r\nlife-history of the Gray Comma is very similar to that of the other\r\nComma. The butterflies hibernate, and in spring lay eggs singly on the\r\nleaves of currants, gooseberries, and related plants. The eggs soon\r\nhatch into caterpillars that feed upon these leaves but do not make\r\nany suggestion of a nest. They grow slowly and change into angular\r\nchrysalids which disclose the summer brood of butterflies in July.\r\nThese lay eggs for another brood of caterpillars which mature into\r\nbutterflies in August and September. These generally go into\r\nhibernation before the middle of October, sometimes choosing simply\r\nthe under side of a branch where their dark coloring, so near like\r\nthat of the bark, is likely to cause them to be overlooked by their\r\nnumerous enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Green Comma=\r\n  _Polygonia faunus_\r\n\r\nThe Angle-wings exhibit interesting variations in the geographical\r\ndistribution of the species. Some are characteristic members of the\r\nCanadian fauna, others of the Alleghanian fauna. Some of those which\r\nare characteristic of the former are scattered south well into the\r\nlatter, but the Green Comma is distinctively a northern species--being\r\nfound abundantly in the great regions traversed by the trappers of the\r\nHudson Bay Company and occurring south as far as northern New England,\r\nbeing very rare as far south as northern Massachusetts. It is abundant\r\non the higher slopes of the White Mountains.\r\n\r\nAs one might expect from the short seasons of the far northern regions\r\nin which this butterfly lives, there is only one brood each year. In\r\nconsequence the adult butterflies live a long time. Coming from the\r\nchrysalis generally the first weeks in August, they remain upon the\r\nwing a month or more before they go into hibernation. They come from\r\ntheir winter quarters in May and commonly continue alive until late in\r\nJune. Thus it is evident that many of these butterflies must live at\r\nleast ten months as adults, an extraordinary longevity for one of\r\nthese frail creatures.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars are known to feed upon the foliage of several kinds\r\nof plants. These include alder, currant, gooseberry, willow, and black\r\nbirch, the last two named apparently being those most often chosen.\r\n\r\nMr. S. H. Scudder called attention to the fact that these butterflies\r\nare able to make a slight clicking noise as they start into flight.\r\nHe described his experience in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Starting up a pair just at my feet on the Mt. Washington carriage\r\nroad one day, I stopped abruptly to see whether they would settle\r\nagain. After flying a few yards away to escape the cause of their\r\ndisturbance, one turned back and dashed straight at my face, turning\r\nonly when within three or four inches of my nose, and then suddenly\r\nwhisked off with a distinct click as it did so, snapping its fingers,\r\nas it were, in my very face. There was no sort of doubt about this\r\nclick, though if it had not been made so close at hand it would\r\nprobably not have been heard. But other butterflies in the tropics\r\nhave long been known to emit sounds like this, which can be heard at a\r\nconsiderable distance; others, including some of our own butterflies,\r\nare known to produce a rustling sound by the rubbing of one wing upon\r\nanother; and movements of one sort and another have been so often\r\nobserved, as of the opposite rubbing of the erect wings in most\r\nLycaenids, and the tremulous agitation of the wings in many different\r\nsorts when excited, as to leave little doubt that sounds made by\r\nthemselves and for the advantage of warning their brethren play a not\r\nunimportant part in the lives of butterflies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:                                     _See page 233_\r\n\r\n     MONARCH BUTTERFLY IN RESTING POSITION]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _Photograph by Miss J.

At any rate, nettles of various kind\r\nare widely distributed over the earth's surface, and consequently it\r\nis not surprising that the Nettle Butterfly or Red Admiral should be\r\nalmost as cosmopolitan as the Thistle butterfly. The two species are\r\nclosely related in structure and habits and the life-history of the\r\none is very similar to that of the other.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of May one may see in open fields and along sunny\r\nhighways these Red Admirals flitting from flower to flower, or\r\nstopping occasionally upon green leaves in search of opportunities to\r\nlay their eggs. Should you observe them closely you might notice that\r\nsome of them seemed frayed and worn while others seemed perfectly\r\nbright and fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Life-story_\r\n\r\nLate in May and early in June these butterflies deposit their eggs\r\nupon the leaves of the nettles. As a rule only one or a few eggs are\r\nlaid on a leaf, but when the butterflies are abundant many leaves upon\r\nthe plant may become infested. About a week later the egg hatches into\r\na larva, which is likely to eat more or less of the empty shell before\r\ncrawling up the stem of the plant to the unfolding buds at the top.\r\nHere it makes its first nest by webbing together the still closed\r\nupper surface of a leaf not yet unfolded. It is thus able to furnish\r\nitself with protection from weather and enemies, as well as an\r\nabundant supply of succulent food. It remains in this first home about\r\na week, then it casts its skin, still within its protection, and stays\r\nuntil it has recovered after the process. It now migrates to another\r\nlarger, expanded leaf where it very cleverly proceeds to construct its\r\nsecond nest. In order to do this it weakens the midrib at the base of\r\nthe leaf by biting nearly through it. Then it cuts a hole in the blade\r\nof the leaf at the base in such a way that the margins are made to\r\ndroop, so that they can be fastened together with silk to form a\r\nlittle tent. We thus have a tent-like nest hanging down from the stem\r\nof the leaf on the under side of which the caterpillar will find\r\nshelter, while near at hand is the green tissue of the inner surface\r\nof the leaf waiting to be eaten. This improvised tent serves as the\r\nhome during this second stage of the caterpillar. Here also the second\r\nmoult commonly takes place, after which the caterpillar migrates to a\r\nnew leaf and constructs its third nest. The rest of the story of the\r\ncaterpillar's life consists of similar chapters. After each moult a\r\nnew tent is formed and even the chrysalis is often hung within the\r\nlast one.\r\n\r\nThe eggs which were laid late in May develop into butterflies during\r\nJuly. These in turn lay eggs for the second brood of caterpillars most\r\nof which develop into butterflies late in August or early in\r\nSeptember, but some of which apparently remain in the chrysalis stage\r\nunchanged throughout the winter, and mature as butterflies about the\r\nmiddle of the following May. This is the explanation of the fact\r\nmentioned at the beginning of this discussion that one can find late\r\nin spring and early in summer some butterflies which seem worn and\r\nfrayed while others seem perfectly fresh. They are all the progeny of\r\nthe midsummer brood of the previous summer, but some of them have been\r\nliving as full-grown butterflies through eight long months of\r\ntempestuous weather, while others have just been disclosed from the\r\nprotecting walls of the chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe world-wide distribution of this butterfly is shown in the\r\nstatement that it occurs throughout Europe, and in North America from\r\nNewfoundland to Cuba and Guatemala. It is a safe guess that it is\r\nfound in practically all localities where nettles grow.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone the association between a butterfly caterpillar and\r\nits host plant which has been brought about during the long ages\r\nthrough which one generation has been succeeding another, but there\r\nhave been also many developments of similar associations between the\r\ncaterpillars and their parasitic enemies. The Red Admiral is a good\r\nexample of such a development. During its long growth as a species it\r\nhas been exposed to attack by vast numbers of tiny foes which live at\r\nthe expense of other insects. Several of these foes have found in the\r\nbodies of the caterpillars good opportunities for growth, so that now\r\nthe Red Admiral, as a species, has to reckon with many enemies among\r\nthese tiny parasites. The interaction between caterpillar host and\r\nuninvited parasitic guest has much to do with the great irregularity\r\nin the numbers of the butterflies. It is simply another example of\r\nthat complicated struggle for existence, by means of which nature\r\nkeeps ever a fairly even balance of her myriad forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Painted Beauty=\r\n  _Vanessa huntera_\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting phases of the study of butterflies is to\r\nlearn how often they take advantage in their life-history of any\r\npeculiarity of the food plant which has a protective value. The\r\nPainted Beauty is an excellent illustration of this. The caterpillar\r\nfeeds upon the leaves of the common Everlasting or Gnaphalium. This is\r\nan abundant and widely distributed plant, found along roadsides and in\r\nfields and pastures. It is notable for the woolly covering on stems,\r\nleaves, and flowers--this dry, hairy surface being so evident that the\r\nflowers will apparently continue in blossom when they have dried,\r\nhence its common name Everlasting or, as the French call a similar\r\nflower, Immortelle. (_See plate, page 161._)\r\n\r\nThe utilization of the hairs upon the leaves is begun by the mother\r\nbutterfly when she lays her egg upon the upper surface, pushing it\r\ndown among the hairs so that it is almost concealed. Should you be\r\nfortunate enough to find one of these eggs you would see that it is a\r\nsmall, yellowish green object, looking like a tiny barrel with several\r\nvertical ribs upon its surface. A few days after the egg is laid it\r\nhatches into a minute caterpillar that begins eating off the hairs\r\nwhere they are attached to the leaf, in such a way that it soon has a\r\nfree space beneath a bunch of these hairs which it has more or less\r\nmatted together by means of silken thread. The little caterpillar has\r\nthus provided for itself a protecting nest that effectually conceals\r\nit from birds or other enemies. It now begins feeding upon the\r\nsucculent surface of the rather thick leaf, where it has removed the\r\nhairs. After several days of such feeding it moults, still under the\r\nshelter of its hairy covering. This process of moulting and feeding\r\ncontinues for two or three weeks, the caterpillar occasionally making\r\na new covering as needed for its food supply.\r\n\r\nThe later nests are likely to be made by folding two or three leaves\r\ntogether, binding them with silken thread. The caterpillar in doing\r\nthis takes advantage of the fact that the terminal leaves are vertical\r\nbefore they have spread out, so that it is a comparatively simple\r\nmatter to make a little house by binding their edges together with\r\nsilken threads. The larva feeds upon the inner walls of the house it\r\nthus constructs, and as it becomes larger the buds and blossoms are\r\nalso utilized for food.\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar is full grown it thus finds itself fairly well\r\nconcealed within a very substantial sort of a home. Many of them have\r\nthe apparent good sense to realize that this is as safe a place as\r\nthey are likely to find for shelter during the period of the\r\nchrysalis. So the caterpillar makes the nest especially secure near\r\nthe centre of what might be called the ceiling and in this web it\r\nentangles its hind legs and hangs downward, preparatory to changing to\r\nthe chrysalis. A few hours later the skin splits apart and is wriggled\r\noff, leaving the chrysalis hanging in place of the caterpillar. About\r\na fortnight later the butterfly emerges and crawls at once to the\r\noutside of the nest, where it rests quietly while its wings expand and\r\nits tissues harden. Then it flies away in search of the nectar of\r\nthistles and many other flowers which it visits freely.\r\n\r\nThis Painted Beauty is a wonderful example of harmonious coloring. The\r\ngeneral tone of the upper surface of the wings is fulvous, with some\r\ndistinct white markings on a blackish background at the outer angles\r\nof the front pair. There is also more or less blackish shading on the\r\nbase and margin of all the wings with an indistinct row of about four\r\ndots, more or less run together, near the margin of the hind wing. The\r\nunder surface of the wings is even more beautiful than the upper, and\r\nfurnishes a striking example of flower-picturing. There is a little\r\nfulvous background near the middle of the front wings, but the rest of\r\nthe surface is spotted and striped with blotches and circles of gray\r\nand brown in a most intricate design. On each front wing near the\r\nouter angle are three indistinct eye-spots in a row, and on the outer\r\nhalf of each hind wing there are two bull's-eye circles, one smaller\r\nthan the other, which form the most conspicuous feature in the marking\r\nof the insect.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown the caterpillars are a little more than an inch long\r\nwith a general color of velvety black, marked with fine yellow lines\r\nand more or less covered with bristly spines. There is also a distinct\r\nrow of whitish spots along each side beginning a short distance back\r\nof the head.\r\n\r\nThis is a widely distributed butterfly, occurring from Canada to the\r\nSouthern states and beyond. In most northern regions it seems to be\r\ntwo-brooded, the butterflies commonly hibernating as adults; but\r\nsometimes the winter is passed in the condition of the chrysalis.\r\nAlong its southern range there are three and perhaps four broods each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Painted Lady or the Cosmopolite=\r\n  _Vanessa cardui_\r\n\r\nOur story of this beautiful butterfly ought really to begin with that\r\nof one of the most successful plants in the world. Now a plant is\r\nsuccessful from its own point of view when it is able to multiply\r\nabundantly in many different sorts of situations and to spread easily\r\nover a large area. The plant I have in mind is the thistle, which\r\nfrom time immemorial has been one of the commonest neighbors of man.\r\nIt is found over the whole habitable globe, as well as in many parts\r\nwhich are scarcely habitable. It has many advantages in its struggle\r\nfor life. The roots penetrate deeply into the soil; the thickened,\r\nspiny leaves are so protected by their juices and their spines that\r\nthey are molested by very few enemies; the flower stalks are also\r\nclothed in a similar armature; and the great heads of flowers are\r\nsurrounded with prickly involucres that generally prevent their being\r\neaten by browsing animals or even by phytophagous insects. The\r\nbrightly colored blossoms are abundantly provided with nectar and\r\npollen, and they attract great numbers of bees, moths, and\r\nbutterflies, in order to bring about cross-fertilization. But all of\r\nthese advantages are of little significance so far as wide\r\ndistribution is concerned, compared with the feathery seeds which are\r\nproduced in such abundance and so generally scattered by the slightest\r\nbreath of wind that the word thistle-down has come into general use to\r\nexpress a lightly moving object. These airy seeds have been riding on\r\nthe wings of the wind all over the surface of the earth for untold\r\nmillions of years. Doubtless during severe storms they may be carried\r\nthousands of miles, and it is easy to think that one of them might\r\nreadily go half-way round the world before it found a resting place.\r\nWherever such a seed alighted and found the condition of a moist soil\r\nand slight protection, it would be likely soon to spring into growth\r\nand to start anew the development of its ancient race.\r\n\r\nThe thistle, however, has not been entirely unmolested during its\r\naeons of existence. There has been developing along with it one of\r\nthe most beautiful of our butterflies which has received various\r\nscientific names and the common name of the Painted Lady, although it\r\nis also often called the Thistle Butterfly and the Cosmopolite, which\r\nlatter title perhaps is to be preferred. This butterfly, however, can\r\nscarcely be considered a troublesome enemy of its host plant, for it\r\nis seldom sufficiently abundant to injure the thistle appreciably. The\r\nrelation between the two is rather suggestive of that mutual\r\ntoleration by which two living things develop together with advantage\r\nat least to one and without serious disadvantage to the other. The\r\nuniversal distribution of the food plant has led to a like\r\ndistribution of the butterfly. Consequently the Thistle butterfly has\r\nlong been recognized as the most cosmopolitan species of its group.\r\n(_See plate, page 176._)\r\n\r\nAside from the wide distribution of its food plant and possibly\r\ncorrelated with it through the diversity of climatic conditions under\r\nwhich the insect has developed, this butterfly is remarkable for its\r\npowers of flight. Many instances are known where it has been taken at\r\nsea long distances from land. This is due not only to the propensity\r\nof the individual for taking aerial journeys, but also to the fact\r\nthat this is one of the butterflies which has the instinct to\r\ncongregate in swarms and to migrate long distances when thus\r\ncongregated. In 1879 such a flock started from Africa and migrated to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable things about this butterfly is our\r\nignorance of what it does with itself in winter. American\r\nentomologists are agreed that the adult butterfly hibernates, but\r\nwhere it does so seems not to be known. Here is an excellent\r\nopportunity for some young naturalist to go scouting, hunting in board\r\npiles, under loose bark, or with a flashlight searching the interiors\r\nof hollow trees to find between November and April living specimens of\r\nthis butterfly. Such a discovery would be a real service to science\r\nand should at once be made known through some scientific journal. In\r\nEurope there seems to be a belief that the insect hibernates partially\r\nat least in the condition of the chrysalis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Life-story_\r\n\r\nWhile we may not know just where the butterflies have been throughout\r\nthe winter, we do know that in southern New England they begin to be\r\nseen in fields and along roadsides about the middle of May. Many of\r\nthe specimens then have a ragged appearance which is a pretty good\r\nindication that they came from the chrysalis the fall before and have\r\nbeen lying concealed through all the weeks since. These butterflies\r\nlay their small greenish, barrel-shaped eggs on the leaves of the\r\nthistle. The mother butterfly chooses the location rather carefully\r\nand deposits only one egg upon a leaf. The butterflies continue thus\r\nto visit flowers and to lay eggs until about the middle of June when\r\napparently they perish.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after the egg has thus been laid, it hatches into a small\r\nspiny caterpillar which does not take the trouble to devour its egg\r\nshell as so many other caterpillars do. Instead it crawls around to\r\nthe lower side of the leaf and gnaws off enough of the silken surface\r\nof the leaf to furnish material for making a webby covering, the leaf\r\nparticles being woven together by threads from the caterpillar's\r\nmouth. In this way the little creature soon provides itself with a\r\nsnug enclosure which serves it as a temporary home. It remains in this\r\nhome much of the time when not eating, going out occasionally to feed\r\nupon the green tissues of the adjacent parts of the leaf.\r\n\r\nThis first home of the young caterpillar, made as it is as a flat\r\nblanket upon a flat surface, can be used only by a very small larva.\r\nConsequently, the caterpillar soon finds these quarters too cramped\r\nand it deserts them to make a new home with larger space. This second\r\nnest is commonly made on the upper surface of a leaf, the edges of\r\nwhich are likely to be more or less drawn together and other supports\r\nconnected from other leaves or a near-by stem. The caterpillar\r\ncontinues to use this nest number two as a place for remaining when\r\nnot feeding and for protection during the process of moulting. But\r\neven this larger nest is likely to be given up about the time the\r\ncaterpillar becomes half grown, and a third nest is begun in the upper\r\npart of the plant. This is likely to be very commodious, its walls\r\nbeing made of leaves or stems bound together by a silken web. Within\r\nthis the caterpillar completes its growth, going out and in through\r\none or more doors when it wishes to feed. Sometimes it even remains\r\nwithin this nest during the process of changing to the chrysalis,\r\nhanging downward from the upper part in much the same way that the\r\ncaterpillar of the Painted Beauty butterfly does. In case it leaves\r\nthe nest when fully developed it generally finds a place near-by in\r\nwhich to pupate.\r\n\r\nAbout ten days after the caterpillar has changed to a chrysalis it\r\nchanges again to the adult butterfly. In southern New England these\r\nbutterflies appear about the middle of July and lay eggs soon\r\nafterward, these eggs hatching into butterflies that change to\r\nchrysalids and change again to butterflies late in August or early in\r\nSeptember. This autumn brood doubtless furnishes the butterflies that\r\nwill be seen upon the wing the following May, so that it is pretty\r\ncertain that they must find some shelter in which to pass the\r\nintervening months.\r\n\r\nThe full-grown caterpillar of the Thistle butterfly is about one and a\r\nquarter inches long and of a general yellowish color, more or less\r\nmarked with blackish as well as with paler lines of color. There are\r\nmany transverse rows of spines along the segments, each yellowish\r\nspine having a circle of smaller ones at the top.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its fondness for thistles, these caterpillars\r\noccasionally feed upon various other plants. One might readily expect\r\nthem to be able to live upon other composites upon which they are\r\nfound, but it seems a bit strange that they should be recorded as\r\nbeing \"especially fond of mallows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Mourning-cloak=\r\n  _Vanessa antiopa_\r\n\r\nOne of the most scholarly students of American insects has happily\r\ncalled the butterflies \"the frail children of the air.\" It seems a\r\nfitting term for creatures so ethereal that they are readily wafted on\r\nthe wings of the slightest breeze and so delicate in structure that\r\nthey are likely to be sadly mutilated by the lightest touch of human\r\nhand. Such creatures one would say belong to regions of perpetual\r\nsummer and have no place in the blizzard-swept winters of our Northern\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nYet if one goes into the snow-clad woods during one of the midwinter\r\nthaws one is likely to see in every open glade several dark-colored\r\nbutterflies flitting from tree to tree, or resting with expanded\r\nwings in the sunniest spots. These butterflies obviously have endured\r\nthe coldest weather and if they are to survive until another season\r\nmust continue to endure still more. This species is commonly called\r\nthe Mourning-cloak butterfly--not a particularly happy name for so\r\nbeautiful an insect. In England it has the more suggestive title of\r\nCamberwell Beauty, and country boys are said to call it the Yellow\r\nEdge butterfly. Its general life-story has already been told on pages\r\n112-115.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of the Mourning-cloak butterflies are restricted to\r\ncomparatively few food plants. In regions where they are not\r\nespecially abundant, they are likely to be found upon willow, poplar,\r\nor elm. In general, as many observations indicate, they are as likely\r\nto be found upon any one of these food plants as upon either of the\r\nother two; but in certain localities where they become especially\r\nabundant it seems that they are more likely to occur upon the elm. On\r\nthis account they have been called the Spiny Elm caterpillars. There\r\nis considerable evidence to show that they prefer the American elm to\r\nother species of the genus, although in the case of willow and poplar\r\nthere seems to be little if any preference as to the species.\r\n\r\nMiss Caroline G. Soule has seen the butterflies depositing their eggs\r\nupon the white and canoe birch, and it has been recorded as feeding in\r\nLabrador and Europe upon a species of birch. There is one record of\r\nthe caterpillars having been found feeding upon the hackberry, and\r\nalso of their having fed greedily upon the leaves of rose bushes, and\r\nstill another of their having almost defoliated a pear tree. Linden\r\nand nettle are also included in the European lists of the food plants\r\nof this species. (_See plates, pages 145, 176._)\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that all of these, except the three first\r\nnamed--willow, poplar, and elm--are to be regarded as exceptional\r\ncases, and that the normal food of the species is the foliage of a\r\nplant belonging to one of these three genera.\r\n\r\nIt has generally been supposed that this species is double-brooded in\r\ncentral and southern New England, the butterflies of the first brood\r\nappearing early in July. These are said to deposit eggs which hatch\r\ninto caterpillars that mature into butterflies early in September.\r\nThese butterflies live through the winter, laying eggs the following\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that as far north as southern New Hampshire the\r\nspecies is commonly single-brooded. During one season when the\r\ncaterpillars were unusually abundant, a very careful watch was kept\r\nfor the second brood in New Hampshire and Vermont by several competent\r\nobservers. Only one colony of caterpillars was found and this was at\r\nDurham in the southern part of New Hampshire near the seacoast.\r\nConsequently, it seems safe to conclude that in northern and central\r\nNew England, at least, a single brood is the rule rather than the\r\nexception. This involves the conclusion that the butterflies seen upon\r\nthe wing early in autumn are the same ones that developed in July, and\r\nthat these same butterflies remain alive through the winter and until,\r\nin the following May, they lay their eggs. Thus there is a period of\r\nten months of existence in the butterfly state, an extraordinary\r\nlength of time for a butterfly to live.\r\n\r\nTo a large extent the butterflies disappear in August, and the\r\nquestion arises as to what becomes of them. Our observations lead to\r\nthe conclusion that they go into summer quarters similar to those\r\nwhich they seek out for winter shelter. Apparently they fly about for\r\na few days after coming from the chrysalis and then retire to cool\r\nwoods, where under the side of a log or beneath the loose bark of a\r\ndead tree they settle down and to all appearances go to sleep. The\r\ninstinct to remain quiet is very strong in these butterflies. In\r\ntaking the accompanying photographs, I found that even shortly after\r\ncoming from the chrysalis the butterflies when disturbed would fold\r\ntheir wings with the antennae between them, and drawing the legs\r\nagainst the body would lie quietly on their sides for a long time.\r\nThese same butterflies would also hang downward from a limb by the\r\nhour in the hibernating position as shown in plate opposite page 32.\r\n\r\nIn the cooler weather of early autumn, the butterflies come from their\r\nretreats and fly about in the sunshine. They are especially likely to\r\nbe seen along the borders of woods or in open glades. At this time\r\nthey love the sunshine, and will settle in a sunny place to bask in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Going into Winter Quarters_\r\n\r\nWhen the warm days no longer tempt them abroad, the Mourning-cloaks\r\nseek shelter in many sorts of situations--under loose bark, in hollow\r\ntrees, under culverts and bridges, in woodpiles, in crevices of rocks,\r\nor alongside logs lying on the ground. In such retreats they remain\r\nuntil the sunshine of spring again calls them forth.\r\n\r\nProf. G. H. Parker's observations indicate that these butterflies are\r\nvery sensitive to changes of temperature, and he has seen the\r\ninteresting action of the butterflies crawling into their hiding\r\nplaces, finding that this takes place each day after they had been\r\nsunning themselves. Thus he writes:\r\n\r\n\"These butterflies remain during cool spring nights in places similar\r\nto those in which they hibernate in winter, _viz._, in openings in\r\nstone walls, in old out-houses, in openings under the bark of trees,\r\netc. They retire to these places with considerable regularity, so that\r\nin the open woods, where dozens of individuals may have been seen\r\nflitting about, all may have disappeared a quarter of an hour later. I\r\nhave watched their retreat with some care. On a clear afternoon in\r\nearly April I took my stand in a woodland where many Mourning-cloak\r\nbutterflies were on the wing. They continued actively flying about\r\ntill approximately four o'clock, when I began to notice a diminution\r\nin their numbers. By a quarter past four not a butterfly was to be\r\nseen. During the fifteen minutes from four o'clock on I followed two\r\nto their hiding places. One alighted on the front of a fallen tree and\r\nwithout expanding its wings crept immediately into a large crack in\r\nthe bark. The second settled on a stone fence and crept into a hole\r\nbetween some loose stones. The period during which this occurred was\r\nmarked not so much by a diminution of light as by a rapid fall of\r\ntemperature.\"\r\n\r\nThat the habit of lethargy in cold and of resting upon the bark of\r\ntrees is practically universal with this species is shown by a\r\nstatement quoted by H. G. Adams in his book, \"Beautiful Butterflies,\"\r\npublished in England in 1871. The writer quoted says: \"In a wood on\r\nthe summit of the Drachenfels, when the wind was rather keen, I found\r\nnumbers resting on the backs of fallen trees in a state of stupor.\r\nThey made no attempts to escape and when thrown into the air their\r\nwings barely opened or flapping feebly eased their fall or enabled\r\nthem to seek repose on the stem of a rotten trunk.\"\r\n\r\n_Its Rarity in England_\r\n\r\nIn many books this species is spoken of by its English name Camberwell\r\nBeauty. It is so called because it was first observed in the\r\nneighborhood of Camberwell in the county of Surrey, England. It seems\r\nthat in that country it is a very rare species. This is a bit curious\r\nconsidering the fact that in America it is so extremely abundant. In\r\nhis attractive little book quoted above, Mr. Adams begins the\r\ndiscussion of this species with this statement: \"This is the crowning\r\nglory of the British butterfly collector's cabinet, and a happy man is\r\nhe who gets a perfect specimen of an insect which is at once so rare\r\nand so beautiful.\" And later in the same discussion is this further\r\nstatement concerning the scarcity of the species: \"In neither the\r\nlarva nor the pupa state has the insect been found, we believe, in\r\nthis country where its appearance occurs, except just here and there a\r\nsingle specimen or two, at long and uncertain intervals. About eighty\r\nyears ago it was seen in many parts of the kingdom and again in 1819,\r\nbut not since then although almost every year one or more specimens\r\nare taken or seen.\"\r\n\r\nA curious fact in regard to the Mourning-cloak, as found in England,\r\nis that the border around the wings seems to be much more generally\r\nwhite than it is with us. J. O. Westwood in his book on British\r\nbutterflies describes the margin as of a white or whitish color and\r\nother writers speak of the same fact. Kirby in his \"Butterflies and\r\nMoths\" makes this comparative statement: \"The border is whitest in\r\nBritish specimens, and perhaps yellowest in American ones.\" He speaks\r\nof it also as one of the rarest British species. It is sometimes\r\ncalled by the common name the White Border and also occasionally the\r\nGrand Surprise, appellations which bear out what has been said above\r\nboth in regard to the color of the border and the rarity of the\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THREE MORE ANGLE-WINGS\r\n\r\n     Upper surfaces at left; under surfaces at right, slightly reduced\r\n\r\n     The Buckeye (_see page 188_)\r\n     The Painted Beauty (_see page 163_)\r\n     The Cosmopolitan (_see page 166_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by W. I. Beecroft_\r\n                                                _See pages 112, 171_\r\n\r\n     THE MOURNING-CLOAK\r\n       Caterpillar, chrysalis, and butterfly]\r\n\r\nThe Mourning-cloaks subsist upon a considerable variety of liquid food\r\nwhich they suck through their long tongues. In spring, when they first\r\ncome from their winter quarters, they visit the stumps of recently cut\r\ntrees and suck the exuding sap, a habit which they continue whenever\r\nopportunity offers. Mr. W. F. Fiske has noticed that they commonly sip\r\nthe sap of maple twigs where the squirrels have gnawed the bark. A\r\nlittle later they visit the willow catkins to suck the nectar secreted\r\nby these blossoms, and still later they hover about the delicate\r\nblossoms of the mayflower, or trailing arbutus, for a similar purpose.\r\nProbably many other flowers are thus rifled of their sweets, although\r\nthis butterfly seems to be a less regular visitor to flowers than are\r\nmany of its allies. A little later, when the aphids, or plant-lice,\r\nhave become sufficiently abundant so that the so-called \"honey dew\" is\r\nto be found upon the infested shrubs, these Mourning-cloaks sometimes\r\nsip the liquid sweet from the surface of the leaves. In April and May\r\nthey occasionally visit the flowers of moosewood, and later in the\r\nseason have been observed upon the blossoms of the common milkweed.\r\nFrom the time the early apples ripen these butterflies may often be\r\nseen beneath the orchard trees, sipping the liquids of the fallen and\r\ndecaying fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Parasites of the Eggs_\r\n\r\nOne fine spring morning I came upon a Mourning-cloak depositing a\r\ncluster of eggs upon a willow twig. She was so busily engaged that I\r\nwas able to draw near and watch the operation for some time before she\r\nflew away. As soon as she was gone I was much interested to see a tiny\r\nparasitic fly running eagerly over the newly laid eggs, and this fly\r\nalso was so busily interested in her work that I was able to cut the\r\ntwig off and sit down to observe at leisure through a lens the actions\r\nof the insect. I dictated to a companion my notes of these\r\nobservations and so was able to get rather a complete record of the\r\nprocess of oviposition.\r\n\r\nThe tiny fly would stop over one of the butterfly eggs, holding its\r\nbody vertical with the hind legs far back and the other legs so\r\nstraightened out as to hold the front of the body high up. Then it\r\nwould insert its tiny ovipositor through the egg shell and proceed to\r\ndeposit an egg of its own inside of the larger egg of the butterfly.\r\nAt least it seemed a safe assumption that this was what happened\r\nalthough of course it was impossible to see the smaller egg at the\r\ntime. While thus engaged the antennae of the tiny fly were bent\r\ndirectly downward to the egg beneath. In about a minute the fly\r\nwithdrew its ovipositor and after running around for a few seconds\r\nagain settled upon another egg and repeated the operation. Then it\r\ntried again on a third egg, after which I got out my watch and began\r\ntiming the process. These are the results in the case of the next\r\ndozen eggs that were laid. It required:\r\n\r\n     94 sec. to lay egg No. 4. Then fly moved around 26 sec.\r\n    120  \"   \"   \"   \"   \"  5.  \"    \"    \"      \"   27  \"\r\n     83  \"   \"   \"   \"   \"  6.  \"    \"    \"      \"   20  \"\r\n     92  \"   \"   \"   \"   \"  7.  \"    \"    \"      \"   22  \"\r\n     75  \"   \"   \"   \"   \"  8.  \"    \"    \"      \"   40  \"\r\n     90  \"   \"   \"   \"   \"  9.  \"    \"    \"      \"   42  \"\r\n    102  \"   \"   \"   \"   \" 10.  \"    \"    \"      \"   15  \"\r\n    120  \"   \"   \"   \"   \" 11.  \"    \"    \"      \"   21  \"\r\n    120  \"   \"   \"   \"   \" 12.  \"    \"    \"      \"   18  \"\r\n     60  \"   \"   \"   \"   \" 13.  \"    \"    \"      \"   25  \"\r\n    120  \"   \"   \"   \"   \" 14.  \"    \"    \"      \"   25  \"\r\n     60  \"   \"   \"   \"   \" 15.  \"    \"    \"      \"   50  \"\r\n\r\nIt thus required an average of about two minutes per egg for the\r\nlaying of these fifteen eggs. I then caught the little fly and sent\r\nher to Dr. L. O. Howard, our greatest authority on this group of\r\ninsects, to learn the name of the parasite. He identified it as\r\n_Telenomus graptae_, a well-known parasite of the eggs of the\r\nMourning-cloak and related butterflies.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting thing about this observation was the fact that\r\nthe little fly had apparently begun its operation before the mother\r\nbutterfly had finished laying her cluster of eggs. There were\r\nthousands of willow twigs in the immediate vicinity. How did this tiny\r\ncreature arrive at this particular place at the particular moment when\r\nfrom its own point of view it was most needed? Had it been riding\r\naround upon the body of the butterfly waiting for the time when she\r\nshould lay the eggs? Or was it attracted to them from somewhere in the\r\nimmediate vicinity? That this early arrival probably takes place\r\ngenerally is indicated by the fact that a similar observation had been\r\nmade in the White Mountains by Prof. C. W. Woodworth.\r\n\r\nThe history of the egg parasite after the laying of the egg seems to\r\nbe comparatively simple. It soon hatches into a tiny larva that\r\ndevelops within the shell at the expense of the contents. It finally\r\nchanges to a pupa which in turn changes to the little fly that gnaws a\r\nhole through the egg shell and emerges to the outer world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Parasites of the Caterpillars_\r\n\r\nAfter hatching from the egg, the Mourning-cloak caterpillars are also\r\nsubject to the attacks of various parasites. One of these is quite\r\nminute, not a great deal larger than the egg parasite. It is a tiny\r\nfour-winged fly which deposits many eggs in a single caterpillar. The\r\neggs hatch into tiny maggots that grow at the expense of the\r\ncaterpillar, finally killing it and changing to four-winged flies\r\nagain. As many as 145 of these parasites have been known to emerge\r\nfrom a single dead caterpillar. These little flies are called Chalcids\r\nby entomologists.\r\n\r\nThere is still another group of four-winged flies, some of which\r\nattack the Antiopa caterpillars. These are much larger than the\r\nChalcid flies and are called Ichneumon flies. In the case of these,\r\nonly one or two parasites develop in each caterpillar or chrysalis.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these various four-winged flies, there are certain\r\ntwo-winged flies, called Tachinid flies, that develop at the expense\r\nof the caterpillars. In New Hampshire, during recent years, these\r\nappear to have been the most abundant parasites of these insects. An\r\negg is laid on the skin of the caterpillar by a two-winged fly,\r\nsimilar in general appearance to the figure below. The contents of\r\nthis egg shortly develop into a tiny grub that burrows through the egg\r\nshell and the skin of the caterpillar into the inside of the body.\r\nHere it remains, absorbing the body substance of its host and\r\ngradually increasing in size. In a few weeks it becomes fully\r\ndeveloped in this grub state. By this time the caterpillar has become\r\nsluggish from the effects of the parasite. If the branch upon which it\r\nfeeds is disturbed, the other caterpillars are likely to crawl away,\r\nbut the enfeebled victim remains in its place.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Tachinid Parasite. (Slightly magnified.)]\r\n\r\nShortly after becoming full grown, the Tachinid grub breaks through\r\nthe skin of the dying caterpillar and, falling to the ground, changes\r\nto a peculiar pupa; the outer skin of the grub turns brown and becomes\r\nhard, forming a protective covering for the body inside. A week or two\r\nlater the insect undergoes another change and emerges as a two-winged\r\nTachinid fly, like the one that laid the egg some weeks before.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Enemies_\r\n\r\nBesides those insects that develop on the inside of the bodies of\r\nthese Antiopa caterpillars there are other insect enemies which attack\r\nthem from the outside and devour them bodily. The most notable of\r\nthese, perhaps, is a large beetle commonly called the Caterpillar\r\nHunter; it is known to entomologists as _Calosoma scrutator_. This is\r\na very active insect, with large strong jaws, that runs rapidly about\r\nin search of victims. In some cases it has been observed while\r\ndestroying many of the Antiopa larvae.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern states a common reddish wasp--a species of\r\nPolistes--has also been observed attacking these caterpillars, and\r\nthere are probably various other insects that destroy them, although\r\ndefinite observations showing this have not been recorded.\r\n\r\nThe Antiopa caterpillars are such spiny creatures that comparatively\r\nfew birds attack them. They are devoured, however, by the two species\r\nof cuckoos--the yellow-billed and black-billed--and it is probable\r\nthat they are sometimes killed by Baltimore orioles and various other\r\nbirds. They are also greedily devoured by toads, but of course they do\r\nnot often come within the reach of these useful animals.\r\n\r\nEven the adult butterflies of this species have to be on the lookout\r\nfor enemies. During the long months of their life many of them\r\nprobably succumb to the attacks of birds or other creatures. I have\r\nseen but one such tragedy. While riding along a country highway with a\r\nbird-loving friend one spring day we saw a male Maryland yellow-throat\r\nflit by with a Mourning-cloak in his mouth. The bird lit on a fence,\r\nfrom which I startled him so that he dropped the butterfly, a worn and\r\nfaded, half-dead specimen. The places where the bird held the insect\r\nwere indicated by missing pieces of the wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The American Tortoise-shell=\r\n  _Aglais milberti_\r\n\r\nThis beautiful butterfly is one of the most distinctive of all our\r\nspecies. It is of moderate size, its wings rarely expanding more than\r\ntwo inches, and it has sufficiently irregular outlines to indicate its\r\nrelationship with the Angle-wings. The most striking feature of the\r\nupper surface is the broad band of orange-brown extending clear across\r\nboth wings a little inside the border. The remaining surface is a\r\ndarker brown marked with two orange-brown spots near the front margin\r\nof each front wing and having scattered iridescent scales which show\r\nplainly under a lens. The suggestion of the coloring of a\r\ntortoise-shell is easily seen in these rich brown tones. The under\r\nsurface is a wonderful illustration of protective coloring. With wings\r\nclosed and resting against the bark of trees or lying beneath the\r\ntrees among fallen leaves, it would require a keen eye to detect the\r\ninsect. (_See plates, pages 160-161._)\r\n\r\nThe American Tortoise-shell is distinctly a northern species. North of\r\nlatitude forty-three degrees it seems to occur practically from ocean\r\nto ocean, extending far up toward the arctic region. It is commonly\r\nfound in British America as far north as Fort Simpson in latitude\r\nsixty-one degrees. There are specimens in the British Museum collected\r\nby the explorer Ross in arctic America, and there are many in our own\r\nNational Museum collected in the Hudson Bay region by various American\r\nexplorers. In New England the species is abundant at times in New\r\nHampshire, Vermont, and Maine. In the vicinity of New York City and\r\nBuffalo, New York, it is rather rare. And south of this latitude it is\r\nfound chiefly at the higher elevations in mountainous districts. As a\r\nrule it is likely to vary in numbers from year to year, sometimes\r\nbeing extremely abundant while more commonly it is rather rare. These\r\nare the same sorts of fluctuations that we find in the case of the\r\nMourning-cloak, the American tent caterpillar, and various other\r\ninsects whose larvae live in colonies. The variation is probably due\r\nto the fact that when the caterpillars become unusually abundant they\r\nbecome correspondingly conspicuous and so provide a shining mark that\r\nis soon discovered by their insect enemies or by various fungous\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Story of Its Life_\r\n\r\nIn its manner of laying eggs this butterfly differs from most others.\r\nThe great majority of our familiar species lay their eggs one in a\r\nplace or possibly two or three near together. Some species deposit\r\nseveral in a group, while some, like the Mourning-cloak, may lay two\r\nor three dozen in a cluster. Very few, however, deposit hundreds in a\r\nbunch. Two of these are the Baltimore and this American\r\nTortoise-shell. In the case of the latter the eggs are loosely laid,\r\nhundreds together, upon the leaves of the common stinging nettle.\r\nProbably each female can deposit six or eight hundred eggs. In less\r\nthan a week the eggs hatch into minute blackish caterpillars that feed\r\nupon the tender tissues of the leaf upon which they were born and then\r\nmigrate together toward the top of the plant. In their habits they are\r\nquite similar to the caterpillars of the Mourning-cloak. As each walks\r\nit spins from its mouth a silken thread and the combined effect of\r\nhundreds of these threads is to make a noticeable silken web over the\r\nleaves. The caterpillars remain in colonies, feeding together from day\r\nto day and gradually denuding the upper branches of the nettle plant,\r\nleaving an unsightly silken web as a memento of their presence. This\r\nwebbing is very suggestive of the similar result left behind by a\r\ncolony of Mourning-cloak caterpillars upon the twigs of elm or poplar.\r\n\r\nWhen about half grown these caterpillars are likely to scatter more or\r\nless in accidental groups which may make small shelter tents from the\r\nlarger leaves. In each little nest there may be four or five or more\r\nof the dark-colored caterpillars. From these shelter tents they sally\r\nforth to feed upon the adjacent leaves and a little later become full\r\ngrown as caterpillars. Each now wanders away and finding such shelter\r\nas it is able to, spins a button of silk and becomes a chrysalis. It\r\nremains in this condition but a short time before it emerges again as\r\nthe beautiful butterfly.\r\n\r\nThis species is commonly reputed to have three broods a year,\r\nhibernating both as a butterfly and as a chrysalis. It has been\r\nsuggested, however, by Mr. W. F. Fiske, one of our most painstaking\r\nentomologists who has studied the butterflies of New Hampshire for\r\nmany years, that it is more probably double-brooded with a period of\r\naestivation during the later weeks of summer. This seems a very\r\nprobable condition and it is to be hoped that some observer will make\r\nsuch a careful study of this species as to settle the point\r\ndefinitely.\r\n\r\nIn the case of many butterflies the distribution of the species\r\ncoincides with the distribution of the food plant. This American\r\nTortoise-shell, however, is perhaps the exception that may prove the\r\nrule, for its southward limit is far north of the southern range of\r\nthe stinging nettle. Evidently, it is a species which has developed in\r\nadjustment to the cool climate of northern regions or high altitude,\r\nand it does not easily adapt itself to a warmer territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The White-J Butterfly or Compton Tortoise=\r\n  _Eugonia J-album_\r\n\r\nDuring bright days in March and April one is likely to find two kinds\r\nof butterflies on the wing in open glades of the woods. One is the\r\nfamiliar Mourning-cloak and the other is the Compton Tortoise--the\r\nlatter generally much less abundant than the former. Both make the\r\nmost of the brief periods of sunshine and quickly disappear when the\r\nsky is overcast.\r\n\r\nThe Compton Tortoise butterflies which are thus abroad in early spring\r\nhave been in hibernation since October. They are helping to carry the\r\nspecies over from one season to another, and as the days become longer\r\nand warmer they appear on the wing more and more, seeking such liquid\r\nfood as the field and forest yields during the days of early spring.\r\nThe sap exuding from holes in bark made by woodpeckers, or from the\r\ntappings of the maple trees by man, the nectar of willow catkins, the\r\nmoisture of roadside pools--these help to yield a precarious\r\nsustenance to these butterflies after their long winter fast. They\r\nremain upon the wing week after week, while spring slowly progresses\r\nin the northern regions they inhabit. When at last the leaves push out\r\non their food trees--willow, birch, and elm--the females lay their\r\neggs and then, having lived to what for a butterfly is a ripe old age,\r\nthey die, after nearly ten months of adult existence.\r\n\r\nApparently the eggs are laid in clusters on the twigs, although this\r\nseems to be one of the many facts about butterflies awaiting\r\nobservation by some careful student. The caterpillars feed together in\r\nsmall colonies but make no nest. They become full grown in about a\r\nmonth. They are then nearly two inches long with spinous, greenish\r\nbodies, striped with lighter lines. Some change to chrysalids about\r\nthe middle of June and ten days later change again to butterflies, the\r\nfirst of which appear early in July while others continue to emerge\r\nfor nearly a month.\r\n\r\nThese butterflies may be seen rather frequently from midsummer on,\r\nvisiting various flowers and sipping the juices from decaying fruits\r\nbeneath the trees. At times they seem to disappear in August to\r\nreappear in October, a fact which has led some observers to suggest\r\nthat there is a second brood. The caterpillars of this brood, however,\r\nhave never been observed and a much more probable explanation has been\r\nmade by Mr. W. F. Fiske who studied the butterflies of New Hampshire\r\ncarefully for many years. He found that in the hot summer weather this\r\nbutterfly goes into a seclusion similar to that of its winter\r\nrest--that is, it aestivates in summer and hibernates in winter. \"The\r\npossibility that the October J-album did not represent a second\r\nbrood,\" writes Mr. Fiske, \"was rendered almost a certainty by repeated\r\nobservations which failed to disclose a single specimen approximating\r\nin freshness to average August individuals, and the question of their\r\nwhereabouts during the interim was unexpectedly answered one warm\r\nAugust day by my finding several snugly packed away under the shingles\r\non an old roof. The theory of the aestivation of the butterflies of\r\nthis group will explain a good many points hitherto obscure in the\r\nlife histories of the other species.\"\r\n\r\nIn October these butterflies seek their winter quarters, finding them\r\nin woods and groves. Apparently they commonly rest upon the bark of\r\nthe trunk as well as crawl into such crevices beneath loose bark as\r\nthey can find. Here they remain through fall, winter, and spring,\r\nexcept when called into brief periods of activity by the unwonted\r\nwarmth of the winter sunshine. Then in spring they come forth again to\r\nlay the eggs for the caterpillars of the new generation.\r\n\r\nThe fresh butterflies are creatures of exquisitely modulated coloring.\r\nThe name Compton Tortoise has reference to the rich brown tones of the\r\nupper wing surface, suggestive of those of fine tortoise-shell. In\r\nfresh specimens much of the surface, especially in the middle and\r\nalong the front border, is overlaid with iridescent purple scales.\r\nNear the front outer angle of each of the four wings there is a\r\ndistinct white spot, divided near the middle by a darker line of the\r\nvein running through it. The under surface is one of the best examples\r\nof mimicry of gray bark to be found in any butterfly. The tones vary\r\nconsiderably in different individuals, but in all the protection must\r\nbe well nigh perfect when the insect is at rest with closed wings upon\r\nthe bark of a tree. The striking angularity of the wing's border\r\ndoubtless helps to conceal it, and the habit of dropping motionless to\r\nthe ground when disturbed must also have protective value. Near the\r\nmiddle of each hind wing there is a small white J which led to the\r\nspecific name _J-album_.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is essentially a member of the Canadian fauna. It\r\nranges from far north in Labrador, British America, and Alaska, south\r\nas far as Pennsylvania, but toward its southern limit it occurs only\r\non the higher elevations of mountains like the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Buckeye=\r\n  _Junonia coenia_\r\n\r\nSome genera of butterflies seem to belong almost exclusively to the\r\nnorth temperate regions, seldom occurring even in our Southern states.\r\nOthers belong equally exclusively to tropical regions, seldom\r\nstraying into the north. The Buckeye is an illustration of the latter\r\ngroup. The genus Junonia to which it belongs is essentially tropical,\r\nas it contains several species which are found throughout the tropics\r\nin both the Old and the New Worlds. In fact, this is apparently the\r\nonly species which occurs north of the tropics. It has an\r\nextraordinary range, being found from Cuba to Massachusetts and from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific coasts. Toward the northern limits of its\r\nrange it is very rare and one of the greatest prizes which the\r\ncollector can obtain. In our Southern states it is an abundant and\r\ngenerally distributed butterfly and, as it hibernates as an adult and\r\none group follows another throughout the season rather rapidly, it is\r\nlikely to be taken at almost any time. (_See plate, page 176._)\r\n\r\nThe mother butterflies select as food plants for the larvae various\r\nmembers of either the plantain or figwort families. They lay eggs, one\r\nin a place, upon the leaves of plantain, figwort, gerardia, and\r\nrelated plants generally near the tip of the leaves. Less than a week\r\nlater these hatch into spiny caterpillars which feed upon the green\r\nsubstance of the leaves during the next few weeks. For the most part\r\nthey eat between the veins leaving a ragged effect which may help in\r\nfinding them. When full grown they change to chrysalids which hang\r\nstraight downward and bear a general resemblance to those of the\r\nThistle butterfly. Curiously enough, those chrysalids which are\r\nattacked by parasites take on a characteristic golden hue; although\r\nthe normal healthy chrysalids are dark brown with a few touches of a\r\ndecidedly lighter brown.\r\n\r\nIn its tropical home, where there is no winter period to interrupt its\r\ngrowth, this butterfly doubtless continues to develop generation\r\nafter generation without any break in the sequence. As the species\r\ngoes north, however, there is necessarily such an interruption--in\r\nwhich case the winter seems commonly to be passed by the adult\r\nbutterfly. In our Southern states there are commonly three or four\r\nbroods each year, while in the northern parts of its range there is\r\nbut one brood a year. In the South there is such an overlapping that\r\nall stages of the insect may be found at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Angle-wings_\r\n\r\n\r\n_I. The Polygonias_\r\n\r\nThe most angular of the Angle-wings are grouped in the genus\r\nPolygonia. They are characterized by having the outer margin of the\r\nfront wings projecting in two places in a way to give an angular\r\neffect, and by having the hind or inner margin distinctly excised\r\ntoward the outer end, so that this margin is curved rather than\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\n_Violet-tip_ (_Polygonia interrogationis_ or _Grapta\r\ninterrogationis_). Expanse 2 1/2 inches. Under surface of each hind\r\nwing marked by a silvery semicolon, made up of a dot and a crescent.\r\n\r\n_Hop Merchant_ (_Polygonia comma_ or _Grapta comma_). Expanse 2\r\ninches. A white comma with expanded tips on lower surface of each hind\r\nwing. Lower surface of all the wings mottled with brown.\r\n\r\n_Green Comma_ (_Polygonia faunus_ or _Grapta faunus_). Expanse 2\r\ninches. A white comma with expanded tips on lower surface of each hind\r\nwing. The lower surface of all the wings more or less mottled with\r\ngreen toward the margins.\r\n\r\n_Gray Comma_ (_Polygonia progne_ or _Grapta progne_). Expanse 2\r\ninches. A white comma with tips narrowed rather than expanded on lower\r\nsurface of each hind wing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II. The Vanessids_\r\n\r\nOur beautiful species of the genus Vanessa may be known by the long\r\nscales that make up the fringe on the wing margins, in alternate\r\ngroups of black and white. There are also several white spots on the\r\nupper surface of the outer angle of each front wing.\r\n\r\n_Red Admiral_ (_Vanessa atalanta_, _Pyrameis atalanta_ or _Cynthia\r\natalanta_). Expanse 2 inches. Upper surface of front wings blackish,\r\nmarked with white spots on outer angle and a broad orange stripe\r\nacross the middle.\r\n\r\n_Painted Beauty_ (_Vanessa huntera_, _Pyrameis huntera_ or _Cynthia\r\nhuntera_). Expanse 2 1/2 inches. Upper surface orange-brown with\r\nblack, white, and blue markings. Lower surface of each hind wing with\r\ntwo large eye-spots, each extending across two veins.\r\n\r\n_Painted Lady_ or _Cosmopolite_ (_Vanessa cardui_, _Pyrameis cardui_\r\nor _Cynthia cardui_). Expanse 2 1/2 inches. Easily distinguished from\r\nthe Painted Beauty by the four or more small eye-spots on the lower\r\nsurface of each hind wing, each eye-spot being included between two\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III. Other Angle-wings_\r\n\r\nThe other common Angle-wings are readily distinguished by the\r\nfollowing characters:\r\n\r\n_Mourning-cloak_ (_Euvanessa antiopa_ or _Vanessa antiopa_). Expanse\r\n3 1/2 inches. Easily known by the nearly black wings with creamy white\r\nborders.\r\n\r\n_American Tortoise-shell_ (_Aglais milberti_ or _Vanessa milberti_).\r\nExpanse 1 1/2 inches. One of the smallest of the Angle-wings. Easily\r\nknown by its small size and the broad orange band extending across the\r\nupper surface of all the wings just beyond the middle. Under surface\r\ndark mottled gray without distinct white markings.\r\n\r\n_Compton Tortoise_ (_Eugonia j-album_, _Vanessa j-album_ or _Grapta\r\nj-album_). Expanse 3 inches. Best known by the straight line of the\r\ninner margin of the front wings and the white j on the under side of\r\neach hind wing.\r\n\r\n_The Buckeye_ (_Junonia coenia_ or _Vanessa coenia_). Expanse 1 3/4\r\ninches. Distinguished by the large eye-spots on the upper surface of\r\nthe wings, one on each front and two on each hind wing. Eyes not\r\nhairy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE SOVEREIGNS\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other small group of American butterflies has attracted so much\r\nattention as the species of the genus Basilarchia, which have been\r\nhappily called the tribe of Sovereigns. These are rather large\r\nbutterflies with rounded wings which are found in one species or\r\nanother over practically the whole of North America. Some of them are\r\nof exceeding beauty and all of them present life-histories of\r\nextraordinary interest. At least two of the species are the most\r\nnotable examples of the mimicry of other butterflies that are shown in\r\nour fauna. They also present some extremely interesting problems for\r\nthe study of natural hybrids and they illustrate in their development\r\nsome of the most wonderful cases of adaptation to environment that\r\nhave ever been found.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by W.

In\r\ngeneral, there is a striking similarity in their structure and habits\r\nin the earlier stages. The eggs are very nearly alike; the\r\ncaterpillars resemble one another so closely that even expert\r\nentomologists sometimes have to decide what species a collected\r\ncaterpillar belongs to by seeing what plant it is feeding upon, and\r\nthe chrysalids are also very similar.\r\n\r\nSome of the more interesting phases in the development of these\r\ninsects are discussed in connection with the life-stories of the\r\ndifferent species. A phase which is characteristic to all of them may\r\nwell be emphasized here. From the time the caterpillars hatch until\r\nthey change to chrysalids they illustrate to a marked degree an\r\nadaptation through structure and habit which must very largely protect\r\nthem from attack by birds and other enemies. Their structure and\r\nmarkings are almost grotesque. The body is covered with strange\r\nclub-like appendages and it is colored with a curious mottling of\r\ntones of green, drab, brown, and white which is very difficult to\r\ndescribe but which suggests, as the caterpillar rests upon rough bark,\r\nsimply a bit of bird dung or some natural excrescence. The\r\ncaterpillars have the habit of feeding at night and remaining upon\r\ntheir perches by day, often assuming positions which are very unusual\r\namong insect larvae. Such positions, in which they remain motionless\r\nfor hours at a time, are undoubtedly of protective value and help to\r\nconceal the insect. After the caterpillars are half grown they rest\r\nnot upon the leaves upon which they feed, but rather upon the bark of\r\ntwigs or branches where their peculiar structure is likely to make\r\nthem inconspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalids of the Sovereigns are also curiously mottled in color\r\ntones that will probably lead to their being overlooked.\r\n\r\nThree distinct species of Sovereigns are found in eastern North\r\nAmerica, namely:\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy, _Basilarchia archippus_.\r\n\r\nThe Banded Purple, _Basilarchia arthemis_.\r\n\r\nThe Red-spotted Purple, _Basilarchia astyanax_.\r\n\r\nThe first species, the Viceroy, has a much wider distribution than\r\neither of the others. It apparently is found in nearly all localities\r\nin which either of these occur, and so includes within its range\r\nalmost the whole of the United States and much of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe second of these, the Banded Purple, is a northern form. It is\r\nfound commonly at least as far north as the Mackenzie River region in\r\nBritish America and southward to central Massachusetts. It also occurs\r\nas far west as Nebraska so that it has a very wide distribution in\r\nnorthern regions. It is especially abundant in Canada and the White\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nThe third, the Red-spotted Purple, is the characteristic form south of\r\nlatitude 42 degrees. Its range overlaps that of the Banded Purple for\r\nabout one degree but it is seldom found north of latitude 42 degrees.\r\nIt seems to range about as far west as the Banded Purple.\r\n\r\nThere are several other butterflies belonging to this genus which are\r\nrarely found and which occur only in certain limited regions. There\r\nhas been much discussion in regard to these. Some entomologists have\r\nthought them simply varieties or dimorphic forms while others have\r\nconsidered them hybrids. An analysis of the conditions shows that\r\nthese doubtful butterflies occur only in regions where the different\r\nspecies overlap. Thus in the boundary connecting the Banded Purple\r\nand the Red-spotted Purple there are forms which resemble these two\r\nspecies in such a way as to suggest that these are the parents of the\r\nhybrid. In localities where the Viceroy and the Banded Purple occur\r\nthere are other forms which seem to connect these two species, and in\r\nthe locality where the Viceroy and the Red-spotted Purple occur there\r\nare still other forms which seem to suggest these as the parents. So\r\nthe evidence seems pretty conclusive that where these butterflies\r\noverlap there are likely to be occasional crosses between the species\r\nwhich result in these natural hybrids.\r\n\r\nIn the far Western states there are certain other species of\r\nBasilarchia which take the place of the eastern form. One of the most\r\nabundant of these on the Pacific Coast is sometimes called Lorquin's\r\nAdmiral (_B. lorquini_). In Florida there is another species, _B.\r\nfloridensis_, which is found in the Southern states. It is the only\r\none whose coloring resembles that of the Viceroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Viceroy=\r\n  _Basilarchia archippus_\r\n\r\nThe common name of this butterfly was probably given it in allusion to\r\nits resemblance to the Monarch butterfly. For the Monarch and the\r\nViceroy have been closely associated in the minds of many observers\r\never since people began to study butterflies in America. These two\r\ninsects have become famous as the most notable examples that we have\r\nof the mimicking of one butterfly by another. According to the theory\r\nwhich has been held by many naturalists, the Monarch is distasteful to\r\nbirds and other animals and it advertises the fact by its bright\r\ncombination of brown and black. The Monarch is thus an example of what\r\nhas often been called warning coloration. On the other hand, the\r\nViceroy is commonly supposed to have no objectionable taste when eaten\r\nby birds, but it so closely resembles the Monarch in its color pattern\r\nand its habits of flight that it has been assumed that birds would not\r\ntouch it because of its resemblance to the distasteful butterfly.\r\nThere has, however, recently been a reaction among naturalists in\r\nregard to the validity of many supposed examples of warning coloration\r\nand the whole subject is still open to careful investigation. (_See\r\ncover; and plate, page 145._)\r\n\r\nWhether the Viceroy deserves its celebrity as an insect mimic or not,\r\nit is well worthy of study for other reasons. It is a common and\r\nattractive butterfly and it has most interesting habits in the larval\r\nstate. It is found over a large part of North America and flies freely\r\nfrom spring until autumn over meadows, fields, and open glades.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Yearly Cycle of Life_\r\n\r\nTo trace the yearly cycle of this butterfly's life, let us begin with\r\none of the mother insects flitting along a stream in early summer. She\r\nstops now and then to lay an egg on the tip of a leaf on a willow or\r\npoplar. She then continues on her way occasionally sipping nectar from\r\nany early flowers she may chance to find, and continuing her leisurely\r\nlife perhaps for several weeks.\r\n\r\nThe egg thus laid upon the poplar leaf remains in position for a week\r\nor more, unless it should be devoured by some wandering ant or\r\ndiscovered by some tiny parasite. If it escapes these dangers, it\r\nhatches into a minute caterpillar that escapes from the egg shell\r\nthrough a hole in its side. After it has come out it turns around and\r\neats the remainder of the shell. It then begins feeding upon the\r\ntender tissue of the leaf it is resting upon, nibbling at the sides\r\nuntil its appetite is satisfied. Then it retires to the midrib on the\r\nlower surface where it remains quietly through the day and thereafter\r\nfeeds chiefly at night. After about a week it becomes too large for\r\nthe skin with which it was born, so it moults and immediately devours\r\nits cast skin. It continues these operations of feeding and moulting\r\nat occasional intervals for several weeks, finally becoming a rather\r\nlarge and curious looking caterpillar, mottled in greenish olive and\r\nlight gray, with two large horn-like projections from the front of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nIt finally becomes full grown in this larval state. Then it spins a\r\nweb of silk upon the bark of the twig and entangles the hooked claws\r\nof its hind legs in the silken web. It thus hangs downward until the\r\nlarval skin is shuffled off and the curious pupa with the conspicuous\r\nhump upon the middle of its back remains in its place. This chrysalis\r\nis of a mottled coloring, very similar to that of the caterpillar. A\r\nweek or so later the chrysalis skin breaks open, and the butterfly\r\ncomes out, catching hold of the twig with its legs and hanging quietly\r\nin position while its wings expand.\r\n\r\nThe butterflies of this brood are likely to appear late in summer. It\r\nis the second brood of adult butterflies for the season. These insects\r\nhave the same leisurely habits as those that were on the wing earlier\r\nin the season. In a similar way the mother butterflies lay their eggs\r\non the leaves of willows and poplars, and these eggs soon hatch into\r\nyoung caterpillars that look like those that hatched in early summer.\r\nThe caterpillars, however, of this autumnal brood have a most\r\ninteresting habit which was entirely lacking in those of early summer.\r\nSoon after hatching they begin to make for themselves little houses in\r\nwhich to pass the winter. This is very cleverly done by utilizing part\r\nof the leaf upon which they are feeding. Each side of the leaf toward\r\nits tip is eaten off with the midrib remaining untouched; then the\r\nlower half of the leaf which has not been eaten is rolled into a tube\r\nand securely sewed together with silken threads. The stem of the leaf\r\nis also covered with a similar silken web and securely fastened to the\r\ntwig in such a way that it is impossible for the leaf to fall off when\r\nthe other leaves do. The little caterpillar thus cleverly provides\r\nitself with a safe winter home into which it retreats on the approach\r\nof cold weather to remain until spring. They enter these little cases\r\nhead first, and apparently seldom emerge again until the warm spring\r\nsun brings them forth to feed upon the developing willow catkins or\r\nthe unfolding leaves.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars that thus pass the winter in these pitcher-like cases\r\nare perhaps a third grown. They develop rapidly in spring and are\r\nlikely to use the cases for resting purposes when they are not\r\nfeeding. After a few weeks they become full-grown caterpillars and\r\nchange to chrysalids, to change again a little later into the\r\nbutterflies that appear in early summer. There are thus two broods of\r\neach stage of the insect during the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Curious Caterpillar Habits_\r\n\r\nThis brief summary of the yearly history of the Viceroy is by no means\r\nadequate as a story of the many interesting things to be told about\r\nthis insect, which has been carefully studied by several eminent\r\nnaturalists. One of these is the strange habit the very young\r\ncaterpillars have of fastening a few bits of leaf together by means of\r\nsilken threads and then tying the bunch to the denuded rib of the\r\nleaf. To explain this, allow me to quote from an admirable essay of\r\nthe late Samuel H. Scudder, whose studies of butterflies have added so\r\nmuch to our knowledge of these beautiful creatures:\r\n\r\n\"Soon after birth,\" wrote Mr. Scudder, \"when it has eaten but a very\r\nfew swaths down the leaf, the little fellow constructs a small and\r\nloose packet from minute bits of leaf and other rejectamenta, loosely\r\nfastened to one another and to the midrib, close to but scarcely\r\ntouching the eaten edge of the leaf; and as fast as the leaf is eaten,\r\nit removes this packet (continually added to until it becomes almost\r\nas big as a small pea) farther and farther down the midrib away from\r\nits perch, always keeping it near the eaten edge. It should be noted\r\nthat it is so loosely attached (the bits of leaf at all possible\r\nangles) that it is moved by the least breath. Meanwhile, the\r\ncaterpillar has been growing larger and more conspicuous, and thus in\r\ngreater peril from its enemies. There are two possible services that\r\nthis odd packet may render. A spider wandering over a leaf and\r\nobserving its motion may seize it, and thinking it has a prize, hurry\r\naway with it and leave its architect unharmed. This seems to me rather\r\na strained suggestion, for a wandering spider would probably proceed\r\nto investigate it on the spot. Another explanation seems more\r\nprobable. It should be remembered that the leaves preferred by these\r\ncreatures as food are mostly such as are easily shaken by the wind,\r\nand as the caterpillar moves with the leaf and with all the\r\nsurrounding leaves (in a continual fluttering in the case of the\r\ntrembling aspen, and to a less degree in the other food plants), this\r\nof itself is a protection to it, as it would more readily escape\r\nobservation as an object distinct from the leaves, all being in motion\r\ntogether; but on the more stable leaves, like the willow, the motion\r\nin a feeble wind would not be sufficient to be serviceable, and here,\r\nat least, the packet comes into play. An object in motion among others\r\nat rest is a noticeable thing; a fact well recognized among animals,\r\nas a host of them show when they fear being seen. This packet attached\r\nby loose silken threads moves, as stated, with a breath of wind, and\r\nso would distract attention from its architect near by, who has taken\r\npains to place it at the farthest remove from his perch while still\r\n(to avoid undesirable steps) on his daily track. If this be really its\r\nobject, it is surely one of the oddest devices in nature.\"\r\n\r\nThe curious winter cases of the Viceroy were first carefully described\r\nby the late Dr. C. V. Riley, in one of his classic reports on the\r\ninsects of Missouri. It is one of the best accounts which has ever\r\nbeen written and is well worth quoting at some length:\r\n\r\n\"The larvae of the autumnal brood,\" wrote Doctor Riley, \"when about\r\none fourth or one third grown, build for themselves curious little\r\nhouses in which they pass the winter. First and foremost--with wise\r\nforethought and being well aware through its natural instincts that\r\nthe leaf which it has collected for its house will fall to the ground\r\nwhen the cold weather sets in unless it takes measures to prevent\r\nthis--the larva fastens the stem of the leaf with silken cables\r\nsecurely to the twig from which it grows. It then gnaws off the blade\r\nof the leaf at its tip end, leaving little else but the midrib.\r\nFinally it rolls the remaining part of the blade of the leaf into a\r\ncylinder, sewing the edges together with silk. The basal portion of\r\nthe cylinder is of course tapered to a point as the edges of the leaf\r\nare nearly drawn together, not overlapped; and invariably the lower\r\nside of the leaf forms the outside of the house so as to have the\r\nprojecting midrib out of the way of the larva as it reposes snugly on\r\nthe inside. The whole, when finished, has somewhat the appearance of\r\nthe leaf of a miniature pitcher-plant (_Sarracenia_), its length\r\nbeing .50-.65 inch, and its diameter .11-.14 inch.\r\n\r\n\"These curious little cases may be commonly found upon our willows and\r\npoplars in the winter time. I have examined hundreds of them and\r\nalthough they are invariably built upon this plan, they vary greatly\r\nin the degree of perfection which the architect attained; and this is\r\nespecially the case where they have been built in confinement. The\r\nblade on the tip piece is sometimes gnawed off right down to the rib;\r\nat others it is left almost as broad as the tube. Sometimes it is bent\r\nover the orifice; at others not. They are also much more irregular and\r\nungainly when made with broad leaves, such as those of the silver\r\npoplar, than when made from the more narrow leaves of the willow tree.\r\nThese autumnal larvae have also another peculiar habit: they exhibit a\r\ntendency to build from the time they are hatched and will always eat\r\nthe leaves from the side, gnawing large holes and cutting along the\r\nsides of the midrib. They commence at the tip, and as they work\r\ndownward toward the base, they collect the debris into a little bunch\r\nwhich they fasten with silk to the midrib. When the hibernaculum is\r\nfinished the seam is perfectly smooth and the hole inside is lined\r\nwith silk. The larva, having completed its work, composes itself for\r\nthe winter with the hind end toward the orifice. Here it remains till\r\nthe catkins are in bloom the next spring when it retreats from its\r\nhouse and commences feeding. Not the least wonderful part of this\r\nphenomenon is that it is only the autumnal brood of larvae that form\r\npitcher-like houses to live in during the inclement season of the\r\nyear--the summer brood having no occasion to shelter themselves from\r\ncold.\" It is an interesting fact that in most northern regions these\r\nwinter cases are nearly always made so near the ground that they are\r\nprotected by snow during most of the winter.\r\n\r\nWhen an insect has such a curious habit as that of making these winter\r\ncases it seems comparatively easy to explain it as an acquired\r\ninstinct brought about through the conditions of life during the long\r\nperiod in which successive generations have been laid. But, as Doctor\r\nRiley seems to suggest above, it is much more difficult to explain\r\nthis sort of phenomenon when it occurs only in one of two or more\r\nbroods during the season.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Banded Purple=\r\n  _Basilarchia arthemis_\r\n\r\nNone of our common butterflies shows more striking color markings than\r\nthe Banded Purple. A broad white stripe runs midway through the wings\r\non both surfaces, the white making a strong contrast to the purplish\r\nor brownish black of the rest of the wings. This white band is\r\nsupplemented by rows of fulvous and of blue dots, especially on both\r\nsurfaces of the hind wings.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is a northern form ranging to a large extent north of\r\nthe regions occupied by the Viceroy. Its life-history is very similar\r\nto that of the latter insect. The caterpillars have the same curious\r\nhabits and bear a close general resemblance to one another. The Banded\r\nPurple butterflies appear in June and lay their eggs in July upon the\r\ntips of the leaves of birches, especially the black birch. Almost all\r\nof these eggs are laid within two or three feet of the ground. They\r\nare of grayish green color. The caterpillars are greenish- or\r\nolive-brown.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after the egg is laid it hatches into a small caterpillar\r\nthat feeds upon the sides of the leaf and rests upon the midrib just\r\nas the Viceroy caterpillar does. It continues to feed through July and\r\nthe early part of August, moulting once or twice before it begins to\r\nform the winter case. It usually goes into this during the latter part\r\nof August, when it is in the second or third caterpillar stage. From\r\nthen on it remains quietly in its winter home, being covered by the\r\ndeep snows during several months, and coming out about the middle of\r\nthe following May, when the spring warmth starts the buds of its food\r\nplant. It then feeds for two or three weeks before it changes to a\r\nchrysalis to emerge in June as a butterfly. There seems to be normally\r\nbut one brood each year although under exceptional conditions some of\r\nthe eggs laid in July mature into butterflies the same season. But it\r\nis probable that these butterflies either do not lay eggs and perish\r\nas the cold comes on, or that if they do lay eggs the caterpillars\r\nthat hatch from them do not get large enough to construct their winter\r\ncases. Consequently, it is doubtful if we can consider the insect\r\nreally two-brooded even in part.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Red-spotted Purple=\r\n  _Basilarchia astyanax_\r\n\r\nWere it not for the wonderful iridescence of its wings the Red-spotted\r\nPurple would be one of the most plainly marked of the Sovereigns. But\r\nthe upper surface of both pairs of wings is thickly covered with\r\niridescent scales which give the insect a shimmering beauty that makes\r\nit conspicuous among northern butterflies, suggesting something of the\r\nmarvelous coloring of the large tropical species. The general coloring\r\nis a purplish black with rows of white dots along the borders of the\r\nwings. The under surface shows much more of the fulvous brown which is\r\nso characteristic of the Viceroy, the brownish background being rather\r\nthinly overlaid with iridescent scales, but with a large number of\r\nspots and stripes, where the fulvous color alone shows.\r\n\r\nThe favorite food plants of this species belong to the great order\r\n_Rosaceae_ which includes the apple, pear, cherry, rose, and many\r\nother common trees and shrubs. The egg is laid upon the extreme tip of\r\nthe leaf, a characteristic habit of all the species of Basilarchia. It\r\nobviously must have decided advantages in preserving the eggs from\r\nattack by ants, spiders, Ichneumon flies, and other enemies. All of\r\nthese creatures are constantly patrolling leaf surfaces in search of\r\neggs and minute insects. They are much more likely to find their\r\nvictims upon the broad general surface than upon the extreme tip of\r\nnarrowly pointed leaves. The eggs of all these butterflies are small,\r\nand pitted much like a tiny little honeycomb with a large number of\r\ntiny hairs arising from the surface. These hairs are very similar to\r\nthe hairs upon the surface of many leaves and they probably assist in\r\nleading other insects to overlook the eggs. Yet, notwithstanding these\r\ndevices for protection, it remains true that a large proportion of the\r\neggs are attacked by tiny parasites and probably many others are eaten\r\nby ants and spiders. This very fact emphasizes the necessity of such\r\nprotective features as the laying of one egg in a place upon the tip\r\nof a leaf and the hairy covering on the egg shells.\r\n\r\nA few days after the eggs are laid each hatches into a small\r\ncaterpillar that immediately begins feeding upon the green tissues\r\nbeside it--first, however, devouring the empty egg shell. It does not\r\neat the midrib of the leaf, but utilizes it as a perch, generally\r\nwinding it more or less with silken threads, apparently to make it\r\nstronger and to prevent it from curling up. The caterpillar seems to\r\nfeed chiefly at night, resting quietly by day. After a week or so it\r\nmoults and then continues feeding as before. It continues to feed and\r\ngrow for several weeks, moulting regularly until it becomes full fed\r\nas a caterpillar. It then spins a web of silk closely upon the bark of\r\ntwig or branch or possibly upon some other object near at hand. In\r\nthis web it entangles the hooked claws of its hind legs and hangs\r\ndownward preparatory to the change to the chrysalis. Soon afterward\r\nthe last larval skin is shed and the chrysalis hangs in place of the\r\ncaterpillar. This chrysalis has the characteristic form of all the\r\nmembers of this limited group, the outer skin being well hardened and\r\nthere being a very prominent projection on the middle of the back.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis hangs thus, buffeted more or less by wind and rain for\r\nabout ten days, then the skin breaks apart and the butterfly emerges.\r\n\r\nOver a large part of its range there are two broods of this butterfly\r\neach year. The adults appear in early summer and lay eggs which\r\ndevelop into butterflies again during the latter part of summer. The\r\nlife-history of this generation is the one described in the last\r\nparagraph. The eggs laid by these late summer butterflies, however,\r\nrequire a somewhat different story. They hatch in the same way as the\r\nothers but when the caterpillars have moulted about twice they form a\r\nwinter case or hibernaculum, in exactly the same way as the\r\ncaterpillars of the Viceroy. They remain within these winter homes\r\ntill the following spring, when they come forth and complete their\r\ndevelopment producing the early summer brood of butterflies with which\r\nour story began.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Vicereine=\r\n  _Basilarchia floridensis_\r\n\r\nIn Florida and some of the other Southern states there is a butterfly\r\nwhich looks almost like the Viceroy except that the brown coloring of\r\nthe wings is very much darker. The species has been called the\r\nVicereine as it is believed to mimic the Queen Butterfly, a species\r\nclosely related to the Monarch and occurring in the Southern states.\r\nThe Vicereine probably has a life-history very similar to that of its\r\nnorthern cousin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Sovereigns_\r\n\r\n_Banded Purple_ (_Basilarchia arthemis_ or _Limenitis arthemis_).\r\nExpanse 2 1/2 inches. Ground color of upper surface of wings black\r\nwith a distinct white band in bow-like form running across the middle\r\nof both wings. A row of six tawny spots just outside the white band on\r\neach hind wing and various sub-marginal blue spots outside of these.\r\nUnder surface tawny brown with the white stripe distinct and many\r\nred-brown spots.\r\n\r\n_Red-spotted Purple_ (_Basilarchia astyanax_ or _Limenitis astyanax_).\r\nExpanse 2 1/2 inches. Ground color brownish black tinged with bluish,\r\nespecially on the hind wings. No white band but various red and blue\r\nspots, especially near the outer margins of the upper surface of both\r\npairs of wings.\r\n\r\n_Viceroy_ (_Basilarchia archippus_ or _Limenitis disippus_). Expanse\r\n2 1/2 inches. General color reddish brown with veins and margins\r\nblackish. A narrow black band running across the hind wings just\r\nbeyond the middle. A series of white spots in all the marginal bands.\r\n\r\n_Vicereine_ (_Basilarchia floridensis_). Expanse 2 1/2 inches. Similar\r\nto the Viceroy but much darker in the brown coloring of all the wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE EMPERORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of this small group are distinguished from the closely\r\nrelated Sovereigns by the tailed hind wings in one species, by the\r\neye-spots on the upper surface of the wings of the others, and by the\r\nfact that on the club of the antennae there are three instead of four\r\nlongitudinal ridges. There is also a distinction in the arrangement of\r\nthe veins of the hind wings.\r\n\r\nThis tribe is represented in our northern fauna by only two genera. In\r\nthe genus Chlorippe the antennae are as long as the front wings are\r\nwide. In the genus Anoea the antennae are much shorter than the width\r\nof the front wings. Only two species of the former and one of the\r\nlatter are sufficiently abundant to be considered here.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Goatweed Emperor=\r\n  _Anoea andria_\r\n\r\nComparatively few butterflies are confined so closely to the valley of\r\nthe Mississippi River as the Goatweed Emperor. From southern Illinois\r\nsouth to the Gulf this insect is rather abundant in many localities\r\nwhere its food plant, the goatweed, is common. The life-history of the\r\ninsect was carefully studied by Dr. C. V. Riley, and one of the best\r\naccounts was published in one of his early reports on the insects of\r\nMissouri. The excellent illustrations in that article first made the\r\nspecies familiar to many students.\r\n\r\nBriefly summarized, the life-history runs something like this: the\r\nbutterflies hibernate, coming forth in spring and visiting various\r\nspring and early summer flowers. The females deposit eggs singly upon\r\nthe leaves of the young goatweed plants. In a week or less each egg\r\nhatches into a little caterpillar that feeds upon the tip of the leaf\r\nleaving the midrib and covering it with silk so that it may serve as a\r\nresting perch. Later each makes an excellent tent for itself by\r\nbending over and binding together the opposite margins of a leaf.[D]\r\nThis bit of work is cleverly done, a hole being left at each end so\r\nthat there is good ventilation and an opportunity for the caterpillar\r\nto go in and out. Quite frequently the nest is also lined with more or\r\nless silken webbing. This tent is used as a refuge from the heat of\r\nthe sun and doubtless serves also in concealing the caterpillar from\r\nits many enemies. The larva goes out to neighboring leaves when it\r\nwishes to feed and only occasionally eats up the leaf of which its\r\ntent is made. When this is done it must of course construct another\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n   [D] _See next page._\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE BANDED PURPLE (_see page 202_)\r\n\r\n   THE RED-SPOTTED PURPLE (_see page 204_)\r\n\r\n   THE BLUE-EYED GRAYLING OR COMMON WOOD-NYMPH\r\n    (Upper and lower surface) (_see page 215_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From drawings by W. I. Beecroft_\r\n                                                 _See pages 207-214_\r\n\r\n     THREE EMPEROR BUTTERFLIES\r\n       The Gray Emperor, female (_top_)\r\n       The Tawny Emperor, female (_middle_)\r\n       The Goatweed Emperor, female (_bottom_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks of this sheltered existence the caterpillar is ready\r\nto change to a chrysalis. It leaves the tent and commonly attaches a\r\nbit of silken web to the under side of a leaf or branch of its food\r\nplant or some other kind of shelter. Here it changes to a chrysalis,\r\nto emerge a little later as the beautiful burnt-orange butterfly.\r\nThere are said to be two broods each season, in some regions, although\r\nin others there seems to be but one. The butterflies hibernate in\r\nhollow trees or in such other shelters as they may find.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Goatweed Butterfly: _a_, larva; _b_, chrysalis;\r\n     _c_, larval case. (After Riley)]\r\n\r\nThe full-grown caterpillar (_a_) is an inch and a half long and of a\r\ngeneral grayish color, dotted thickly with slightly elevated points.\r\nThe chrysalis (_b_) is suggestive of that of the Monarch butterfly.\r\nIt is light green covered with whitish granules.\r\n\r\nThe adult butterfly is remarkable for the falcate shape of the outer\r\nmargin of each front wing and the broad tail at the hind outer angle\r\nof each hind wing. In the male the upper surface of all the wings is\r\nof a dark orange tone, with a rather narrow brown marginal marking. In\r\nthe female this marginal band is broader and is nearly paralleled by\r\nanother narrower band a little nearer the body. In bright sunshine\r\nthere is a distinct purplish red iridescence over practically the\r\nwhole upper surface. The under side of both wings is of a color to\r\nsuggest a dead brown leaf, with a purplish iridescence in certain\r\nangles of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Gray Emperor=\r\n  _Chlorippe celtis_\r\n\r\nThis very distinctive medium-sized butterfly is found in the Southern\r\nstates at least as far west as the Mississippi Valley. It extends\r\nnorth to Indiana and Ohio and probably occurs quite generally from\r\nOhio eastward. This species is distinguished by the general gray-brown\r\nor olive-brown coloring of the wing surfaces, heavily marked with a\r\nmuch darker dusky brown and with many irregular white spots as well as\r\none large eye-spot on each front wing near the border, and a row of\r\nseven more or less distinct eye-spots near the border of each hind\r\nwing.\r\n\r\nLike the Tawny Emperor this species feeds in the larval state upon the\r\nleaves of hackberry. In Missouri the butterflies appear in June. A\r\nlittle later they lay eggs upon the under side of the hackberry\r\nleaves, commonly one in a place but sometimes several side by side. A\r\nfew days later these eggs hatch into little yellow caterpillars that\r\nfeed upon the leaves for about a month when they become full grown.\r\nThey are then a little more than an inch long, of a general light\r\ngreen color with yellow spots along the middle of the back and three\r\nyellow lines along each side. The head has a pair of curious antlers\r\nmuch like those of the caterpillar of the Tawny Emperor. These\r\ncaterpillars now spin a bit of silken web on the under side of the\r\nleaf or twig. They attach their hind legs into this web and hang\r\ndownward for a day or two, before casting the last larval skin and\r\nchanging to chrysalids. They change again to butterflies which are\r\nseen upon the wing early in August. These butterflies lay eggs in turn\r\non the hackberry leaves, the eggs soon hatching into small\r\ncaterpillars which according to Riley's observations are less active\r\nthan those of the earlier brood. These caterpillars feed for a few\r\nweeks until they become nearly half grown and have passed their second\r\nor possibly their third moult. They now stop eating and get ready for\r\na long fast through the winter. Apparently some of them at least\r\nattach themselves to the under side of the hackberry leaves and turn\r\nto a brownish color, remaining upon the leaves until the latter fall\r\nto the ground and presumably hibernating in the shelter thus provided.\r\nWhether or not all of the caterpillars have this rather curious habit\r\nseems to be doubtful. It has been suggested that some of them find\r\nshelter within the crevices in the rough bark of the tree. At any\r\nrate, the caterpillars remain in a sort of stupor until the following\r\nspring. Then they awaken, climb up the trees or bushes, and begin\r\nfeeding upon the young leaves. They continue this until they become\r\nfull grown in May when they change to chrysalids, to emerge as the\r\nfirst brood of butterflies the following month. Many of the\r\ncaterpillars make a sort of nest for themselves by spinning a web of\r\nsilk upon the under surface of the leaf and drawing together slightly\r\nthe outer edges.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with so many other butterflies that hibernate as\r\ncaterpillars, apparently the species is only partially double-brooded.\r\nSome of the earlier caterpillars become lethargic when half grown and\r\nremain in that condition throughout the later weeks of summer and all\r\nthrough the fall and winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Tawny Emperor=\r\n  _Chlorippe clyton_\r\n\r\nThis handsome butterfly is easily distinguished from the Gray Emperor\r\nby the general reddish color of the wings which are thickly marked\r\nwith bands and eye-spots of darker brown or black. The eye-spots are\r\nespecially marked on the hind wing, there being a row of five of these\r\non each hind wing in both sexes. The females are decidedly larger than\r\nthe male and generally of a distinctly lighter color.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is a southern species found more or less abundantly\r\nfrom southern New York to northern Florida and across the country to a\r\nline drawn from Iowa to Texas. It seems to be more common in the\r\nMississippi Valley than in other regions and its life-history was\r\nfirst thoroughly worked out in Missouri and published in one of\r\nRiley's classic reports on the insects of that state. It has since\r\nbeen studied by Edwards and others, but even now there seems to be\r\nsome uncertainty in regard to many points in its development, notably\r\nthe number of broods in different localities and the habits of the\r\nlarvae when preparing for hibernation.\r\n\r\nThe principal points in the life-history of the species may be\r\noutlined as follows: some time in July the eggs are laid on the leaves\r\nof hackberry in dense clusters, each of which may contain from two\r\nhundred to five hundred eggs. These are usually deposited in two or\r\nmore layers, one upon another. A little more than a week later these\r\neggs hatch, each caterpillar eating through one end in a way to cut\r\nout the rim of a tiny cap which is pushed up as the larva escapes. The\r\nwhole brood emerges at practically the same time and collects upon one\r\nor more leaves where they begin to feed upon the succulent green\r\ntissues. Like so many caterpillars that feed in companies each spins a\r\nsilken thread wherever it goes.\r\n\r\nThe little larvae remain together until after the third moult, at\r\nwhich time they are about half grown. In the more northern regions\r\nwhere they are found they are now likely to scatter about in search of\r\nquarters for hibernation. Having found suitable shelter, they remain\r\nthrough the winter to come forth early the following spring and feed\r\nupon the developing leaves of the hackberry trees. They continue to do\r\nthis for a few weeks before they become full grown. They are then\r\nsmooth-bodied, greenish worms about an inch and a half long, striped\r\nlongitudinally in yellow and brown. The hind end of the body is forked\r\nin a curious fashion and the head is even more remarkable for the\r\nstrange pair of tiny antlers projecting from it.\r\n\r\nThese full-grown caterpillars soon change to pale green chrysalids,\r\nlightly striped with longitudinal lines of yellow, with a distinctly\r\npointed head. From these chrysalids butterflies emerge early in\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nEvidently in the more Southern states there are two broods of these\r\nbutterflies each year but there is great need of more precise\r\nknowledge in regard to them.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with so many other butterflies there is a dimorphic\r\nform, called _ocellata_, in which the outer half of the hind wing is\r\nvery dark brown, with the eye-spot showing as black with red-brown\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Emperors_\r\n\r\n_Goatweed Emperor_ (_Anoea andria_ or _Pyrrhanea andria_). Expanse\r\n2 1/2 inches. Front outer angle of each front wing projecting into a\r\nfalcate tip. Rear outer angle of each hind wing projecting into a\r\ndistinct tail. General color burnt-orange with darker marginal bands,\r\nand in the female on the upper surface other sub-marginal markings.\r\n\r\n_Gray Emperor_ (_Chlorippe celtis_). Expanse 2 inches. General color\r\ngrayish brown with numerous markings of white and blackish. A distinct\r\nbrown eye-spot on the upper surface of each front wing near the outer\r\nhind angle.\r\n\r\n_Tawny Emperor_ (_Chlorippe clyton_). Expanse 2 inches. General color\r\ntawny brown with markings of black and yellowish white. No distinct\r\neye-spot on upper surface of front wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEADOW-BROWNS OR SATYRS\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Agapetidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Meadow-browns form one of the most distinctive family groups among\r\nall the butterfly tribes. They are characterized, at least so far as\r\nour eastern species are concerned, by their slender bodies and rather\r\nlarge wings, toned in various shades of brown, and marked chiefly with\r\nconspicuous and characteristic eye-spots. The larger veins of the\r\nfront wings are swollen at the base. The caterpillars are rather\r\nslender and have a curious division of the last body segment into two\r\nparts, which gives them an appearance suggestive of the caterpillar of\r\nthe Emperor butterflies, although the Meadow-brown caterpillars do not\r\nhave, upon the head, the curious antlers borne by the Emperor larvae.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Common Wood-nymph or Grayling=\r\n  _Cercyonis alope_\r\n\r\nIn the development of our knowledge of both birds and mammals as found\r\nupon the American continent the experience in many cases has been\r\nessentially this: a bird or a mammal was first described from some\r\nwell-known region of North America, commonly from specimens carried to\r\nEurope by early voyagers. Later other species of the same genus were\r\nbrought to light by various explorers and given specific names. As\r\neach section was thus explored a new form differing markedly from the\r\nothers was found and named. At a later period, when great collections\r\nwere brought together so that one observer was able to make a careful\r\nsurvey of specimens from all parts of the continent, it was found that\r\nmany of these species merged into each other through intergrading\r\nforms from regions between the localities of the original species. So\r\nit has come about that in the case of a large number of our birds and\r\nmammals we have geographical races distinctly recognized instead of\r\nseparate species.\r\n\r\nWhile the study of butterflies has by no means received the degree of\r\nattention which has been given the birds and mammals, it is already\r\nevident that a similar condition prevails with reference to many\r\nspecies. As the size of collections has increased and more careful\r\nstudies have been made of the various forms from different regions it\r\nhas been found in numerous cases that they intergraded to so great an\r\nextent that it is impossible to distinguish many species which were\r\nformerly considered entirely distinct. One of the most striking\r\nexamples of this is found in the case of our common Wood-nymph, which\r\nis sometimes called the Blue-eyed Grayling. The form which is one of\r\nour most abundant butterflies in southern New England and many of the\r\nEastern states was described as _Satyrus alope_ by the French\r\nnaturalist Fabricius, who also described another species from the\r\nSouthern states as _Satyrus pegala_, and a form found in northern\r\nCanada was described by the English entomologist Kirby as _Satyrus\r\nnephele_. Various other forms from isolated regions have been given\r\nspecific names by other authorities. (_See plate, page 81._)\r\n\r\nDuring recent years many collectors have gathered these butterflies\r\nfrom all parts of North America and many specimens have been grouped\r\ntogether in the more important collections. When this occurred it\r\nbecame easy to see that this is essentially a variable species which\r\nunder varying climatic conditions has assumed slightly different\r\nforms, so that we have a good illustration of well-developed\r\ngeographical races. The more important of these are indicated in the\r\nsynopsis of the Meadow-browns on page 227.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Similar Life-histories_\r\n\r\nOne good indication that these varying forms all have a common origin\r\nis found in the remarkable unity of their life-histories. It is\r\nessentially the same in all. The mother butterflies lay eggs late in\r\nsummer upon the leaves of grasses and perhaps other plants. About\r\nthree weeks later these eggs hatch into small caterpillars that\r\nimmediately become lethargic and begin their hibernating condition\r\nwithout eating any vegetation. They remain thus fasting until spring\r\nwhen, after the weather warms up sufficiently, they begin to feed upon\r\ngrasses and perhaps other herbage. But they have lots of time in which\r\nto complete their growth and they are very moderate in their eating\r\nand their movements. They grow slowly so that they do not become\r\nmature as caterpillars until June. They then change to chrysalids to\r\nemerge as butterflies during July and August. The female butterflies\r\nremain upon the wing for some weeks before they begin to lay their\r\neggs. We thus have in this case an adaptation to single-broodedness in\r\npractically all stages of the insect's life. The twelve months of the\r\nyear must be passed and egg, larva, chrysalis, and butterfly each\r\nseems to try to do its part in prolonging its period of life.\r\n\r\nThese butterflies are especially common along streams and near the\r\nborders of woods, as well as in upland pastures and meadows. They are\r\ninteresting creatures with characteristic manner of flight. They are\r\nby no means so easy to capture as one might think who sees them\r\napparently going with slow, erratic motions from flower to flower. Mr.\r\nS. F. Denton, a collector of long experience, has written this\r\ninteresting paragraph upon this point:\r\n\r\n\"As the flight of these insects is weak, they have been obliged to\r\nresort to a number of tricks to outwit their enemies. In capturing\r\nthese butterflies the collector will very soon become acquainted with\r\ntheir modes of escape, which are very interesting and show no small\r\namount of cunning, scarcely to be looked for in an innocent little\r\nbutterfly. Their first plan of escape on being disturbed is to make\r\ndirectly for a clump of bushes into the thickest part of which they\r\ndive and there remain until the danger is past. If one is startled\r\nfrom the grass at some distance from a safe retreat and the collector\r\novertakes him, he will immediately dodge backward and forward, at one\r\ntime high in air and again low down near the grass tops, and in spite\r\nof his slow flight keeping well clear of the net. If the net is at\r\nlast brought very close to him he will try his last desperate scheme\r\nto elude his pursuer and shutting his wings quickly together will drop\r\ninto the grass, disappearing as if by magic. If it were not for the\r\ncunning of the frail little creatures they would doubtless have gone\r\nto the wall long ago in the struggle for existence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Southern Wood-nymph=\r\n  _Cercyonis pegala_\r\n\r\nThis large southern butterfly is sufficiently distinct from the other\r\nWood-nymphs to rank as a separate species. The yellow blotch has\r\nexpanded into a large band extending practically across the front\r\nwings. On its upper surface there is one eye-spot in the male and two\r\nin the female. It is abundant in the extreme Southern states and has\r\noccasionally been taken much farther north.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Pearly Eye=\r\n  _Enodia portlandia_\r\n\r\nMost butterflies are creatures of open country, basking freely in the\r\nsunshine and visiting flowers of many sorts for their nectar food.\r\nSome of them are found at times along the borders of woods and others\r\nseek the woods especially in autumn for the purpose of hibernation.\r\nThis exquisite Pearly Eye, however, is distinctly a woodland species,\r\nbeing found only in little glades in the midst of woods and apparently\r\nseldom even seeking flowers for their nectar. It is commonly\r\nconsidered one of the rarest of American butterflies, but many\r\ncollectors who have searched their regions carefully have been able to\r\nfind small areas in which the butterfly is quite abundant. In such\r\nsituations it may be looked for in all parts of the United States east\r\nof the western limits of the Mississippi Valley and south of Canada,\r\nexcept perhaps the lower part of Florida.\r\n\r\nIn northern regions this butterfly is single-brooded: the adults\r\nappear shortly before midsummer and continue on the wing through July\r\nand at least part of August. The eggs are laid some weeks after the\r\nbutterflies emerge. The caterpillars feed upon grasses and apparently\r\nhibernate after they become well grown, changing to chrysalids the\r\nfollowing spring in time to emerge as butterflies in early summer.\r\n\r\nThese Pearly Eyes have certain characteristics which are of especial\r\ninterest. No other species presents such exquisite modulation of brown\r\ncoloring arranged in beautiful circles upon both surfaces of the\r\nwings. The males possess, perhaps to a greater degree than any other\r\nof our native butterflies, the ability to give off a peculiar,\r\npleasant aroma which is noticeable whenever the insects are collected\r\nand which at least one careful observer has been able to detect in the\r\nopen air as the butterfly flew near.\r\n\r\nFor many years Mr. W. F. Fiske made a special study of the butterflies\r\nprevailing in the region of Webster, New Hampshire. His word picture\r\nof the haunts of the Pearly Eye is more adequate than any other which\r\nhas been published and seems well worth quoting in this connection:\r\n\r\n\"I have found them in several localities, always in some numbers, but\r\nnowhere more abundant than in a little wooded glen in Webster. Here a\r\nscattering group of tall pines, a few thick hemlocks, and a young\r\ngrowth of miscellaneous deciduous trees fill up the space between two\r\nrather steep banks. A small trout brook follows close by one of these\r\nbanks, and near the lower end of the glen, in a space kept clear of\r\nunderbrush by the overshadowing influence of the pines and hemlocks,\r\nis a little spring, the overflow from which keeps the ground moist for\r\nsome space on each side of the channel which it follows to the brook.\r\nThis is the great meeting place of these butterflies; here they may be\r\nseen at almost any time in the day except in the early morning--when\r\nthey seek the outskirts of the woods--until the shades of evening\r\nrender their flitting forms indistinguishable. Half-way up the bank on\r\none side, half shrouded in the dense growth of underbrush which is\r\nspringing up around it, is an old apple tree upon which the sapsuckers\r\nwork yearly. The wounded limbs, dripping with sap, are frequented by\r\nmany forms of insect life, most noticeable among them this butterfly,\r\nand such refreshment added to the moisture which they suck from the\r\nmargin of the spring is all that I have ever seen them partake.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Eyed Brown=\r\n  _Satyrodes canthus_\r\n\r\nFor delicacy of gray-brown color tones few butterflies can compare\r\nwith this exquisite creature. It seems indeed to have succeeded in a\r\nmodest attempt to obliterate itself, for even when the spread wings\r\nare placed against a clear white background they can scarcely be\r\ncalled conspicuous and it is very probable that when the butterfly is\r\nat rest in its native haunts, with wings closed together so that only\r\nthe very delicate light brown color-tones of the under surface are\r\nrevealed, it actually becomes invisible.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of the wings is broadly washed with a gray-brown\r\ncolor which runs into a suggestion of a lighter band near the outer\r\nmargin of the front pair. The upper surface of the hind wings is\r\nalmost uniformly washed with this same brown color which is\r\ninterrupted only by very fine, double lines at the outer margin and a\r\nsub-marginal row of delicate _ocelli_ which are larger than the\r\nsomewhat similar sub-marginal row of eye-spots on the front wings. The\r\nunder surface is much lighter in color, with distinct striations\r\nextending across the main surface of both wings from front to back and\r\nwith some very attractive _ocelli_ arranged as a sub-marginal series\r\neach with a central white eye.\r\n\r\nThis is distinctly a northern species, having rather a limited range\r\nin Canada and New England. It extends south to Pennsylvania and Ohio\r\nand westward to Wisconsin and Iowa. It is more abundant in northern\r\nthan in southern New England but it is often overlooked by collectors\r\nwho are not familiar with its haunts. It is especially likely to be\r\nfound among the tall grass of swamps and brooks running through\r\nlowlands. One of the best ways to discover it is to beat the grasses\r\nin such situations.\r\n\r\nThe life-history of the Eyed Brown is fairly well known. The eggs are\r\nlaid chiefly on grasses and probably at times upon the grass-like\r\nsedges. The larvae feed upon these plants and become nearly full grown\r\nbefore winter sets in. They then hibernate in this larval stage and\r\nthe following spring complete their growth and change to chrysalids in\r\ntime for the butterflies to emerge in June. There is but one brood a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The White Mountain Butterfly=\r\n  _Oeneis norna semidea_\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the extraordinary distribution of this notable species\r\none must let his fancy carry him back a million years or so until he\r\nreaches that old time when the whole northern part of the American\r\ncontinent was covered with an icy coating. Then he must follow the\r\ngradual retreating of the ice northward, carrying with it wonderful\r\nchanges in climate and along with these climatic changes taking\r\nnorthward many plants and animals which were adapted to the cool\r\ntemperature along the borders of the glacier. As the ice cap retreated\r\nmost of these arctic forms retreated with it, and all along the lower\r\nlevels they were replaced by others migrating from the south so that\r\ngradually there came about the distribution of plants and animals as\r\nwe find them to-day.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the glaciers left the higher elevations of the White\r\nMountains and the Rocky Mountains there were at the summits small\r\nareas in which the climatic conditions were of very much the same\r\narctic character as prevailed along the margin of the ice cap.\r\nConsequently conditions were here favorable for the continuation of\r\nmany of the arctic species which had disappeared from the warmer,\r\nlower levels. It was as if we had a great sea of air of a certain\r\nwarmth and rising above this the islands of the mountain tops, these\r\nislands retaining the same arctic features as otherwise are found much\r\nfarther northward.\r\n\r\nAmong the animals thus left stranded by the retreating ice cap this\r\nWhite Mountain butterfly has perhaps attracted the most attention from\r\nscientists. It is a butterfly of moderate size which shows in every\r\nphase of its structure and its life-history the results of the long\r\nprocess of adaptation to its unique environment. It has been carefully\r\nstudied by many observers and has been considered one of the most\r\ndesirable trophies by every collector of insects. As a result,\r\nnotwithstanding its isolation and the difficulty of studying it, its\r\nlife-history is better known than that of many a common and widely\r\ndistributed species.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the facts in regard to the structure and life of this\r\nbutterfly one must know that its habitat is confined to a thousand\r\nfeet or so at the summits of the mountain, that in this area there are\r\nno trees or even shrubs worth mentioning, and that the surface of the\r\nmountain is covered with rocks between which grow a few stunted sedges\r\nand over which grows the ever-present reindeer moss. It is a bleak,\r\nbare, gray environment, constantly swept by terrific winds, where snow\r\nis seen in August and is likely to remain until June. So the summer\r\nseason is of briefest duration and the climatic conditions are so\r\nsevere that one can only wonder how a fragile creature like a\r\nbutterfly is able to survive the twelve long months.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Habits and Life-history_\r\n\r\nFrom a first glance at the mottled gray-brown wings of these insects\r\none would guess that here was a distinctive example of obliterative\r\ncoloring, and it is true as all observers testify that when the\r\nbutterfly lights upon the stones and turns sideways, as apparently it\r\ndoes habitually in deference to the force of the wind, it becomes very\r\ndifficult to see, for the wings are closed and only the rounded,\r\nmottled under surface shows. It appears also to have the habit of some\r\nof the Graylings when hard pushed of simply closing its wings and\r\ndropping to the ground feigning death. In deference also to the winds\r\nits flight is just above the surface. Doubtless if it rose high in the\r\nair it would be swept away to lower regions where evidently it is\r\nunable to survive for long periods.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by Mary E. Walker_    _See page 229_\r\n\r\n     THE ZEBRA BUTTERFLY\r\n     On orange leaves and blossoms. (Reduced)]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: On a milkweed pod]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From \"Seeing Nature First\"_     _See pages 47, 235_\r\n\r\n     On clematis seed-fruits\r\n     PHOTOGRAPHS OF A PET MONARCH BUTTERFLY]\r\n\r\nThese butterflies appear early in July and continue on the wing for\r\nseveral weeks. They lay their small eggs upon or near a species of\r\nsedge which is abundant on these alpine summits. About two weeks later\r\nthe eggs hatch into sluggish little caterpillars which feed upon the\r\nsedge leaves, apparently eating only at night and hiding in crevices\r\nbetween stones by day. As one would expect from the prevailing low\r\ntemperatures these caterpillars grow very slowly and apparently a\r\nlarge proportion of them require two years to complete their\r\ndevelopment. There seems to be some uncertainty in regard to this\r\nphase of the insect's life-history, but most entomologists are of the\r\nopinion that some of the butterflies mature in one year while others\r\nrequire two years: that is, the broods are both annual and biennial.\r\nThere is no doubt that the insect hibernates as a caterpillar, and if\r\nthis statement about the number of broods is correct some of the\r\ncaterpillars hibernate when very small, and recently hatched from the\r\negg, while others hibernate when nearly full grown.\r\n\r\nThe full-grown caterpillars change to chrysalids beneath the shelter\r\nof the small stones in practically the same sorts of situation which\r\nthey have chosen for hiding at night or for hibernation through the\r\nwinter. Here without any button of silk or silken loop and with\r\nscarcely a suggestion of a silken cocoon they change to chrysalids,\r\ngenerally about the first of June. They remain in this condition for\r\nperhaps three or four weeks when they come forth as butterflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Arctic Satyr=\r\n  _Oeneis norna jutta_\r\n\r\nThis is another butterfly of decided interest because of its\r\ngeographical distribution. It is normally an inhabitant of the Far\r\nNorth, extending around the North Pole over parts of three continents.\r\nApparently, the only place in the United States where it occurs is a\r\nbog a little north of Bangor, Maine. This locality is called the\r\nOrono-Stillwater bog and is the only place where collectors have been\r\nable to find this species.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn even more local insect is another of these mountain butterflies\r\nfound by H. H. Newcomb on Mount Katahdin, Maine. So far as known this\r\nspecies is confined to the higher portion of this mountain and so is\r\neven more distinctly localized than the White Mountain butterfly. It\r\nis called the Katahdin butterfly (_Oeneis norna katahdin_).\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Little Wood Satyr=\r\n  _Cissia eurytus_\r\n\r\nThis elfin creature has well been named the Little Wood Satyr,\r\nalthough under our modern conditions it is often found in fields and\r\nalong hedgeroads rather than in the woods. It has, to a marked degree,\r\nthe delicacy of structure of its allies and its small size serves to\r\nemphasize this appearance. It has also a rather general distribution\r\nwest to the Mississippi Valley, extending from the corner of Dakota,\r\nsouth through Nebraska, Kansas, and central Texas, and north to\r\nWisconsin, Michigan, and New England. It occupies the whole of the\r\nUnited States east and south of the lines thus indicated.\r\n\r\nThe life-history of this species is very similar to the Common\r\nGrayling. The butterflies appear in early summer, deposit their eggs\r\nupon grasses, and the resulting larvae feed upon the grasses and grow\r\nslowly through the weeks of summer. They become nearly full grown by\r\nautumn and hibernate in this condition in such shelter as they can\r\nfind at the soil surface. The following spring they come forth,\r\nprobably feeding for a short time, and change to chrysalids in time to\r\nemerge as butterflies in May and early June. Practically all observers\r\nemphasize the fact that the butterflies are abundant only late in\r\nspring or early in summer, generally disappearing before the middle of\r\nJuly. There is thus but one brood a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Meadow-browns_\r\n\r\nThe _Gemmed Brown_ (_Neonympha gemma_) is a small southern species\r\nremarkable for the plainness of its gray-brown wings which are marked\r\non the upper surface only with two or three dark spots on the middle\r\nmargin of each hind wing. There are two broods a year.\r\n\r\nThe _Georgia Satyr_ (_Neonympha phocion_) is another small southern\r\nform, remarkable for the four elongated eye-spots on the lower surface\r\nof each hind wing. The shape of these spots distinguishes it at once\r\nfrom the _Carolina Satyr_ (_Cissia sosybius_) in which the eye-spots\r\nare rounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of Meadow-browns_\r\n\r\n_Pearly Eye_ (_Enodia portlandia_ or _Debis portlandia_). Expanse\r\n2 1/4 inches. Eyes hairy. Outer margin of hind wings projecting in a\r\nnoticeable angle. Brown with many distinct eye-spots on both surfaces\r\nof wings.\r\n\r\n_Eyed Brown_ (_Satyrodes canthus_ or _Neonympha canthus_). Expanse 2\r\ninches. Eyes hairy. Margin of hind wings rounded, without an angle.\r\nBoth surfaces of wings pale brown with four distinct blackish\r\neye-spots on each front wing near the margin. Five or six such spots\r\non each hind wing.\r\n\r\n_Common Wood-nymph_ or _Grayling_ (_Cercyonis alope_). Expanse 2\r\ninches. Eyes not hairy. Eye-spots on front wings, but not on upper\r\nsurface of hind wings. The chief geographical races of this abundant\r\nspecies are indicated below, although in regions where the forms\r\noverlap many intermediate hybrids occur.\r\n\r\n_Blue-eyed Grayling_ (_Cercyonis alope alope_). A large\r\nyellowish-brown blotch near outer margin of each front wing, above and\r\nbelow, with two distinct eye-spots in middle spaces of the blotch. A\r\nsouthern race extending north to central New Hampshire, Michigan, and\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\n_Dull-eyed Grayling_ (_Cercyonis alope nephele_). The yellowish brown\r\nblotch obsolete or nearly so, but eye-spots present. A northern race\r\nextending southward only to central New Hampshire, Michigan, and\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\n_Maritime Grayling_ (_Cercyonis alope maritima_). Similar to the type\r\nform, but with the yellowish blotch tinged with reddish. A race found\r\nonly near the seacoast.\r\n\r\n_Southern Wood-nymph_ (_Cercyonis pegala_). Expanse 3 inches. Eyes not\r\nhairy. General color brown with an orange-yellow blotch near outer\r\nmargin of each front wing above and below with one eye-spot in middle\r\nspace of the blotch on the male, and two on the female.\r\n\r\n_Little Wood-satyr_ (_Cissia eurytus_ or _Neonympha eurytus_). Expanse\r\n1 1/2 inches. Eyes not hairy. General color fawn-brown with two\r\neye-spots on upper surface of each front wing and several on each hind\r\nwing.\r\n\r\n_Gemmed Brown_ (_Neonympha gemma_). Expanse 1 1/4 inches. Eyes not\r\nhairy. General color mouse-brown with no markings on upper wing\r\nsurface except a rather indistinct pair or more of spots next the\r\nmargin of the middle of each hind wing. Under surface indistinctly\r\nstriped with rusty lines and a few brown and silvery spots on the hind\r\nwings directly beneath the spots on the upper surfaces. Occurs in\r\nSouthern states.\r\n\r\n_Georgia Satyr_ (_Neonympha phocion_). Expanse 1 1/4 inches.\r\nDistinguished from the related species by the four distinct eye-spots\r\non lower surface of each hind wing, these spots being transversely\r\nelongated rather than round. Occurs in Southern states.\r\n\r\n_Carolina Satyr_ (_Cissia sosybius_). Expanse 1 1/4 inches.\r\nDistinguished by the row of round eye-spots near outer margins of\r\nlower wing surface. Occurs in Southern states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HELICONIANS\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Heliconidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a tropical family with only a single species migrating\r\nnorthward to our Southern states. The butterflies of this group are\r\ncharacterized by having the wings so long and narrow that their length\r\nis usually twice as great as their width. The front legs in both sexes\r\nare so poorly developed that they are considered a modification\r\napproaching the complete dwarfing found in the Brush-footed\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Zebra Butterfly=\r\n  _Heliconius Charitonius_\r\n\r\nWhile the butterflies of temperate North America show many examples of\r\nmarvelous beauty and coloring, one must go to the tropics to see the\r\nculmination of what nature has done in painting the outstretched\r\nmembranes of butterfly wings with gorgeous colors. The great butterfly\r\ntribes that swarm in tropical forests seldom reach our temperate\r\nclime, and even when they do they are likely to show only a suggestion\r\nof the splendid size and rich coloring to be seen farther south. The\r\nZebra butterfly (_Heliconius charitonius_) belongs to one of these\r\ntropical tribes. It shows its affinities by its coloring and the\r\ncurious shape of its wings. In most of our northern butterflies, the\r\nwings are about as long as they are wide, but in the tropical family,\r\n_Heliconidae_, they are very much longer than wide. This gives the\r\ninsect an entirely different look from our common forms so that one\r\nrecognizes it at once as a stranger within our gates. Indeed, it does\r\nnot penetrate far into our region, being found commonly only in\r\nFlorida and one or two other neighboring states, its principal home\r\nbeing in tropical America.\r\n\r\nThe Zebra butterfly is well named. Across the brownish black wings\r\nthere runs a series of yellow stripes, three on each front wing and\r\none on each hind wing, with a sub-marginal row of white spots on each\r\nof the latter. The under surface is much like the upper, except that\r\nthe coloring is distinctly paler. It is very variable in size: some\r\nspecimens may be but two and a half inches across the expanded wings,\r\nwhile others are four inches. (_See plate, page 224._)\r\n\r\nThe Zebra caterpillars feed upon the leaves of the passion flower.\r\nWhen full grown they are about an inch and a half long, whitish, more\r\nor less marked with brownish black spots arranged in transverse rows,\r\nand partially covered with longitudinal rows of barbed black spines.\r\nThey change to chrysalids which are remarkable for their irregular\r\nshape, with two leaf-like projections on the head which the insect can\r\nmove in a most curious fashion.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable things about this insect is the fact that the\r\nmale butterflies are attracted to the chrysalids of the females even\r\nbefore the latter emerge. Many observers have reported upon this\r\ncurious phenomenon and have recorded experiments demonstrating that it\r\nis a general habit with the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Roosting Habits_\r\n\r\nThe adult butterflies flock together at night and rest upon the\r\nSpanish moss which festoons so many of the trees in the Far South, or\r\nupon dead branches. They take positions with heads upward and wings\r\nclosed, many of them often flocking together to roost, and wandering\r\nout to the near-by fields when the morning sun gives them renewed\r\nactivity. But these butterflies are essentially forest insects.\r\nReliable observers have noticed that when one emerges from a chrysalis\r\nit flies up in the air and makes straight for the nearest woods.\r\nOthers have noticed that when a butterfly in a field is alarmed it\r\nalso makes for the woods. And in the regions where the species is\r\nabundant the butterflies are most likely to be found in paths and\r\nglades in the forest. Thus they show the influence of their ancestral\r\nhabitat in the tropical wilderness.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a certain amount of ceremony attending the flocking\r\ntogether at night for roosting purposes. A famous English naturalist,\r\nPhilip Henry Gosse, saw the performance in the West Indies many years\r\nago and described it in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Passing along a rocky foot-path on a steep wooded mountain side, in\r\nthe Parish of St. Elizabeth (Jamaica), about the end of August, 1845,\r\nmy attention was attracted, just before sunset, by a swarm of these\r\nbutterflies in a sort of rocky recess, overhung by trees and creepers.\r\nThey were about twenty in number, and were dancing to and fro, exactly\r\nin the manner of gnats, or as _Hepioli_ play at the side of a wood.\r\nAfter watching them awhile, I noticed that some of them were resting\r\nwith closed wings at the extremities of one or two depending vines.\r\nOne after another fluttered from the group of dancers to the reposing\r\nsquadron, and alighted close to the others, so that at length, when\r\nonly two or three of the fliers were left, the rest were collected in\r\ngroups of half a dozen each, so close together that each group might\r\nhave been grasped in the hand. When once one had alighted, it did not\r\nin general fly again, but a new-comer, fluttering at the group,\r\nseeking to find a place, sometimes disturbed one recently settled,\r\nwhen the wings were thrown open, and one or two flew up again. As\r\nthere were no leaves on the hanging stalks, the appearance presented\r\nby these beautiful butterflies, so crowded together, their long, erect\r\nwings pointing in different directions, was not a little curious. I\r\nwas told by persons residing near that every evening they thus\r\nassembled, and that I had not seen a third part of the numbers often\r\ncollected in that spot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILKWEED BUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Lymnadidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as the great majority of readers of this book are concerned,\r\nthis family includes but one species--the familiar Monarch or Milkweed\r\nbutterfly. In the Southern states there is another--the Queen--and in\r\nFlorida, still a third. The distinguishing characteristics are found\r\nin the dwarfed, useless front legs and the absence of scales upon the\r\nantennae.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Monarch=\r\n  _Anosia plexippus_\r\n\r\nFrom June until October one may often see the stately Monarch flitting\r\nleisurely about over fields and meadows. It is one of the largest and\r\nmost distinctive of these \"frail children of the air\" and may be\r\neasily recognized by its resemblance to the picture opposite page 241.\r\nThe veins of the wings are heavily marked in black, with large white\r\ndots upon the black bands along the margin. The color of the rest of\r\nthe wings both above and below is reddish brown.\r\n\r\nThese butterflies come from the South in spring or early summer. They\r\nfind milkweed plants and lay their eggs upon the leaves. These eggs\r\nsoon hatch into small white and black caterpillars that feed upon the\r\nmilkweed leaves and grow rapidly. One is likely to find them\r\nthroughout most of the summer, wherever a milkweed shows partially\r\neaten leaves. Bring in the half-grown caterpillars, place them in an\r\nopen vivarium, and furnish fresh leaves every day or two. The\r\ncaterpillars will soon mature and change to beautiful green chrysalids\r\nwith golden markings. This chrysalis has been called \"the glass house\r\nwith the gold nails.\" (_See plates, pages 32-33, 241._)\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks later the glass house will burst open and the\r\nbutterfly emerge. It will rest an hour or two while its wings and body\r\nharden and then it will want to fly away. It is not so anxious to do\r\nthis, however, as most butterflies. If one is kept beneath a\r\ngood-sized bell-glass, or in a glass-covered box, or even in a closed\r\nroom, and fed with sweetened water it will soon become so tame that it\r\nwill perch on one's finger and suck nectar from a flower held in one's\r\nhand. On this account it is a particularly desirable butterfly for the\r\namateur photographer to cultivate, because he can easily get many\r\ninteresting and beautiful pictures by posing the butterfly on\r\ndifferent flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Change from Caterpillar to Butterfly_\r\n\r\nThe change from the caterpillar to the butterfly is easier to watch in\r\nthis species than in most others. The full-grown caterpillar\r\nspins--sometimes on the under surface of the milkweed leaf, sometimes\r\nelsewhere--a little mat of silk in which it entangles the hooked claws\r\nof its hind feet. Then it lets go with its fore feet, and hangs\r\ndownward with the front end of its body curled upward. In this\r\nposition it remains for some hours--perhaps a day--the body juices\r\ngravitating downward and causing a swollen appearance on the lower\r\nsegments. Then the skin splits apart and is wriggled off by the\r\ncontortions of the body. When it finally drops away, there is left a\r\nstrange-looking creature, broader below than above. This is a\r\ntransition stage that lasts but a very short time: soon the form is\r\nentirely changed so that the broadest part is above instead of below.\r\nThe definite outline of the chrysalis is soon taken on, the outer\r\ntissues hardening into a distinct covering. The insect is now a\r\nbeautiful green with wonderful golden spots upon its surface and a few\r\nblack spots just below the black \"cremaster\" by which the chrysalis is\r\nconnected with the web of silk upon the leaf.\r\n\r\nIn this quiet chrysalis the insect remains for nearly a fortnight.\r\nThen the structure of the forthcoming butterfly begins to show through\r\nthe thin outer covering and you know that the period of the chrysalis\r\nis nearly ended. If you keep watch you will probably see the sudden\r\nbursting of the outer envelope and the quick grasping of its surface\r\nby the legs of the newly emerged butterfly. Its wings at first are\r\nshort and crumpled, bearing little resemblance to those of the fully\r\ndeveloped butterfly. But as it hangs there with one pair of legs\r\nholding to the empty chrysalis and the other to the leaf above, the\r\nwings rapidly lengthen, hanging limply downward, and the body juices\r\npenetrate the veins. A little later they expand in the other\r\ndirection, the hind wings reaching full size before the front ones do.\r\nFinally both pairs of wings are fully expanded, and the butterfly is\r\nlikely to walk to the top of the support, where it rests for an hour\r\nor two while its tissues harden, before it attempts to fly.\r\n\r\nIn early autumn out of doors these butterflies start southward on\r\ntheir long journey. They often gather in great flocks and roost at\r\nnight on wayside shrubs and trees. At this season it is easy to catch\r\nthem in an insect net and bring them indoors for pets. They live for a\r\nlong while and lend interest and beauty to living room or window\r\ngarden. To the photographer they offer opportunities for attractive\r\nindoor pictures. (_See plates, pages 32-33, 160, 225._)\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Queen=\r\n  _Anosia berenice_\r\n\r\nThe general form and color patterns of this fine butterfly show at\r\nonce that it is related to the Monarch. Its general colors are\r\nchocolate-brown and black, dotted and spotted with white. The eggs are\r\nlaid upon milkweed and the life-history is much like that of the\r\nMonarch. One of the most interesting facts in connection with this\r\nspecies is that it seems to be mimicked by the Vicereine butterfly in\r\nthe same way that the Monarch is mimicked by the Viceroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SNOUT BUTTERFLIES OR LONG-BEAKS\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Libytheidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nOne has a suggestion of Hobson's choice in the common names of this\r\nunique family. If Snout butterflies does not seem sufficiently elegant\r\nas a descriptive phrase for such delicate creatures, he can call them\r\nthe Long-beaks, until he sees that this also is inadequate. As a\r\nmatter of fact both are misnomers, for the projection from the head\r\nthat gives them these names is neither a snout nor a beak. It is\r\nsimply a pair of palpi unusually developed, which perhaps in an early\r\nstage of butterfly history served a useful purpose. At present,\r\nhowever, they serve chiefly to set the few owners apart from the other\r\nbutterflies in the system of classification; although possibly they\r\nmay also serve the butterfly by helping to give the impression of a\r\nleaf attached to a twig. (_See plate, page 240._)\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Snout Butterfly=\r\n  _Hypatus bachmani_\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar interest in any form of animal life which can be\r\ndefinitely traced far back through the geologic ages. In nearly every\r\ngroup of living creatures there are certain types which scientists\r\nhave found were once abundant but which now are on the wane. As a rule\r\nthese are better represented in the museums through fossil species\r\nthan by those now living. To a considerable extent also such forms are\r\nlikely to present various features which mark their primitive\r\ncondition and the living allies have peculiarities which set them off\r\nas distinct from those of their own relations which have been modeled\r\nin a more modern fashion. Among the mammals the curious marsupials, of\r\nwhich our southern opossum is an example, furnish good illustrations\r\nof this general truth. Among the birds the curious little Least\r\nBittern is an example. Among the butterflies the strange Snout\r\nbutterfly is by far the best example.\r\n\r\nThese Snout butterflies, of which only two species are now living in\r\nNorth America, are the sole representatives with us of the family\r\n_Libytheidae_ or the Long-beaks. Only one of these species occurs to\r\nany extent at least north of Texas. It is the curious little creature\r\ncalled the Snout butterfly. It has a strange appearance due to the\r\nangular outline of both front and hind wings and the long palpi which\r\nproject forward from the head in a way to attract attention. The\r\ncommon name is due to these projecting palpi. Even the coloring is\r\nprimitive, the general tone of the wings being blackish brown,\r\ndistinctly marked with white and orange spots. The under surface is\r\nless primitive in its coloring, being toned in iridescent grayish\r\nbrown in a way to suggest protective coloring, except in that part of\r\neach front wing which is not hidden when the insect is at rest. This\r\nshows the white and orange-brown markings.\r\n\r\nSome years ago there were found in certain fossil deposits in the\r\nWest about a dozen species of fossil butterflies. It is strange indeed\r\nthat these ethereal creatures should be fossilized at all. One would\r\nthink it scarcely possible that they could be so preserved that a\r\nmillion years after they had died man should be able to study them,\r\ndetermine to what families they belonged, and even guess with a high\r\nprobability of accuracy upon what leaves their caterpillars fed. This\r\nlittle collection of fossil butterflies was studied by one of the\r\ngreat American authorities on living butterflies, the late Samuel H.\r\nScudder, who said of them: \"They are generally preserved in such fair\r\ncondition that the course of the nervures and the color patterns of\r\nthe wings can be determined, and even, in one case, the scales may be\r\nstudied. As a rule, they are so well preserved that we may feel nearly\r\nas confident concerning their affinities with those now living as if\r\nwe had pinned specimens to examine; and, generally speaking, the older\r\nthey are the better they are preserved.\"\r\n\r\nA curious fact is that out of the comparatively few species of these\r\nfossil butterflies two were easily recognized as members of this\r\nLong-beak family. They were given special scientific names and\r\nundoubtedly were closely related to the Snout butterfly which is still\r\nflying every year in various parts of the United States. Our modern\r\nspecies lays its eggs upon the leaves of hackberry and in these\r\ngeologic deposits of that far-gone era there have been found\r\nwell-preserved leaves of old hackberry trees, upon which it is\r\nextremely probable that the caterpillars of these ancient Long-beaks\r\nfed. What an opportunity for a modern collector of butterflies to work\r\nhis fancy, as he thinks of those old times when these fossil creatures\r\nwere flying in the sunshine, depositing their eggs upon the leaves of\r\ntrees that made up landscape pictures probably very different from\r\nthose of to-day! And how he wonders what flowers these butterflies\r\nvisited for their nectar food, what birds chased them from tree to\r\ntree, and what mammals wandered through those ancient forests. What a\r\nsuggestion also it gives of the continuity of life upon our old earth\r\nto realize that these butterflies of to-day are carrying on their\r\nbrief existence in practically the same way that these forbears of\r\ntheirs did so many millions of years ago.\r\n\r\nAnother way in which these butterflies are peculiar is the fact that\r\nthe females have six well-developed legs while the males have only\r\nfour. As already indicated the caterpillars feed upon hackberry. When\r\nfull grown they are about an inch long, dark green, striped with\r\nyellow, with two blackish tubercules on the second ring behind the\r\nhead. They apparently pass the winter in the chrysalis stage. The\r\nbutterflies are likely to be found along the borders of brooks or\r\nstreams running through woods, or along the margins of the forest.\r\nOccasionally they become abundant in certain localities, but on the\r\nwhole they are rare and highly prized by collectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METAL-MARKS\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Riodinidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small family of very small butterflies contains five genera and a\r\ndozen species found in the United States and Mexico. Only two,\r\nhowever, occur in the eastern region and only one extends much north\r\nof the Gulf states. Aside from certain peculiarities of the\r\nwing-venation (a costal and a humeral vein on the hind wings) these\r\nMetal-marks may be known by their minuteness and the bright metallic\r\nmarkings on the brown wings.\r\n\r\nBoth our eastern species belong to the genus _Calephelis_. The Small\r\nMetal-mark (_C. caenius_) has been collected in Florida and Georgia.\r\nThe wings are rusty red on both surfaces, brighter below than above,\r\nand marked with blackish spots that almost converge to form stripes;\r\nin addition to which there are, beyond the middle of each wing, two\r\nlines made by special scales that glisten with a steel glitter. The\r\nwings expand only about three quarters of an inch. So far as I can\r\nlearn, the egg, larva, or pupa have never been described.\r\n\r\nThe Large Metal-mark is called by science _Calephelis borealis_, but\r\nit deserves the latter name only in the sense that it is more northern\r\nthan its allies. It has been collected as far north as New York and\r\nMichigan, but it seems to be very seldom found, at least in eastern\r\nregions. It expands a little more than an inch. The general color of\r\nthe wings is yellowish brown, marked with blackish dots and lines,\r\ntogether with rows of steely spots on the under surface. In this case\r\nalso the life-history is unknown.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:                                     _See page 236_\r\n\r\n     THE SNOUT BUTTERFLY IN FLIGHT AND AT REST]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration:                                      _See page 62_\r\n\r\n     GIANT SWALLOWTAIL JUST OUT OF THE CHRYSALIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by W.

Their bodies are small and slender, their\r\nantennae ringed with white and almost threadlike, their wings thin and\r\nof exquisite beauty. Many of them are marked with the slenderest of\r\ntailed projections from the hind wings. When the face is viewed\r\nfrom in front it is seen to be much narrower than its height. At the\r\ninsertion of the antennae the eyes are notched, and they are also more\r\nor less surrounded with white scales. Most of the caterpillars have\r\noval, slug-shaped, smooth bodies, with the under surface flattened,\r\nand very small heads, which in many species can be extended by means\r\nof an extensile neck. The chrysalids are held in place by silken\r\nthreads both at the tail and over the middle. They are rounded, short,\r\nand stout.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their small size, the Gossamer-wings are among the\r\nmost spritely of all our butterflies. They seem indeed winged sprites,\r\nplaying everywhere, in fields and open woods, along roads, lanes, and\r\nbrooks, in dooryards and gardens--wherever, in fact, a bit of open\r\nspace invites their presence. Not alone upon the wing but even when at\r\nrest does their liveliness appear. For most of these butterflies have\r\nthe curious habit of keeping the hind wings in motion after alighting,\r\nrubbing them against each other in a vertical plane or \"moving them\r\nbackward and forward when half expanded.\" These habits are so fixed\r\nthat when one sees a butterfly thus engaged one can pretty certainly\r\nconclude it is a member of this family.\r\n\r\nThe Gossamer-wings are commonly separated into three rather distinct\r\ntribes--the Hair-streaks, the Coppers, and the Blues. The\r\ncharacteristic features are these:\r\n\r\nThree branches arising from the radius of each front wing. Under\r\nsurface of hind wing commonly marked with threadlike streaks: the\r\nHair-streaks.\r\n\r\nFour branches arising from the radius of each front wing. Under\r\nsurface of hind wing commonly marked with spots rather than lines.\r\n\r\nColors brownish red: The Coppers.\r\n\r\nColors blue: The Blues.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE HAIR-STREAKS\r\n\r\nThe Hair-streaks are small butterflies with the eyes notched to allow\r\nfor the insertion of the bases of the antennae. The name is given on\r\naccount of the fine, hair-like markings which extend across the under\r\nsurface of the hind wings. In many species there is a tailed\r\nprojection or two on the hind inner margin of the hind wing. The\r\ncaterpillars are remarkable for the small head, so connected with the\r\nbody that it can be pushed forward in a characteristic way.\r\n\r\nThe Hair-streaks are among the most exquisite and delicate of all our\r\nbutterflies. A large proportion of them have the upper surface of the\r\nwings toned in beautiful hues of grayish brown and the under surface\r\nlighter gray, marked with dots and stripes, some of which are\r\nbrilliant in coloring. A few of the larger species are brilliantly\r\niridescent in purples, blues, and greens, marked with black. The males\r\nhave well-developed scent-pockets in many species, these being\r\ncommonly along the front border of the front wing.\r\n\r\nA very interesting suggestion in regard to the possible function of\r\nthe curious tail projections was made nearly a hundred years ago by\r\nsome English entomologists and has since been discussed at\r\nconsiderable length in various publications. It is that the slender\r\ntails, together with the enlargement of the wing just back of them,\r\ngive the impression of a false head. Along with this unusual\r\ndevelopment of the wing is to be considered the fact that these\r\nbutterflies nearly always alight head downward so that the false head,\r\nfurnished with what seem to be waving antennae, takes the place that\r\nwould naturally be occupied by the true head. Instances have been\r\nreported in which this false head has apparently been nipped off by a\r\nlizard and much evidence has accumulated to indicate that this curious\r\ndevice may be a real protection in many cases. Of course, the loss of\r\nthe tails and the part of the wings adjacent would be comparatively\r\ninsignificant. In most cases, these projections on the wings are held\r\nat right angles to the plane of the wing.\r\n\r\nWhile nearly half a hundred species of Hair-streaks have been found in\r\nNorth America, only a few of these are sufficiently abundant to\r\nrequire discussion in this little book.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Great Purple Hair-streak=\r\n  _Atlides halesus_\r\n\r\nIt seems something of a reflection on the activities of American\r\nentomologists to say that, after the lapse of more than a century\r\nsince Abbott studied the insects of Georgia, our knowledge of the\r\nearly stages of two of the largest Hair-streak butterflies is still\r\nconfined to the observations he made. Yet this is true, and one of\r\nthem--the Great Purple Hair-streak--is the largest species of the\r\ngroup that occurs in the eastern United States. The other is the\r\nWhite-M Hair-streak.\r\n\r\nThe Great Purple Hair-streak is a beautiful, iridescent blue creature,\r\nas seen from above, with blackish borders around the blue. As seen\r\nfrom below, the wings are dark brown, with red spots near the body.\r\nThe two tail-like projections are quite long. It is very large for the\r\ngroup to which it belongs, measuring nearly two inches across the\r\nexpanded wings. It is a tropical form, extending into our southern\r\nborders from California to Florida and occasionally occurring north as\r\nfar as southern Illinois. The larvae feed on oak. (_See plate, page\r\n256._)\r\n\r\n\r\n =The White-M Hair-streak=\r\n  _Eupsyche M-album_\r\n\r\nThe White-M Hair-streak is about two thirds the size of the Great\r\nPurple species with less blue and more black on the upper wing\r\nsurface. The hind tail is slender and well developed, and the angle of\r\nthe wing just back of it is rounded out in an unusual fashion. The\r\nlower surface of the wing is of a general grayish brown color, marked\r\nby a white stripe, which takes the form of the letter M: hence its\r\nname. This is also a southern species occurring at times as far north\r\nas Ohio and even Atlantic City, New Jersey. The caterpillars feed upon\r\nthe leaves of oak and Astragalus or milk vetch.\r\n\r\nThere is also a third species of this group of whose history we are\r\nignorant except for Abbot's observations. It is an exquisite little\r\nbutterfly called the Least Purple Hair-streak (_Calycopis cecrops_)\r\nand is apparently a tropical form which has spread into our Southern\r\nstates. It is especially beautiful because of the brilliant red and\r\nwhite lines running across the under surface of both wings. It occurs\r\nas far north as West Virginia and Kentucky and ranges westward at\r\nleast to the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Gray Hair-streak=\r\n  _Uranotes melinus_\r\n\r\nThis exquisite little creature is capable of surviving under a great\r\nvariety of climatic conditions. It ranges from New Hampshire to\r\nFlorida and Central America, but apparently occurs only rarely north\r\nof the United States. Perhaps the most distinctive feature in the\r\nfemale is the orange spot just in front of a pair of tiny tails on\r\neach hind wing, the rear one being curiously curved and about three\r\ntimes as long as the other. In the male the shorter tail is absent.\r\nThe general color of the upper surface is a dark bluish gray, relieved\r\non the margin of each hind wing by a few white dots and the orange\r\nspot already mentioned. The under surface is much lighter gray,\r\ndistinctly marked with two dark brown lines near the margin, the outer\r\nline little more than a row of spots and the inner line with a white\r\nedge. (_See plate, page 257._)\r\n\r\nThese small butterflies lay tiny though beautiful eggs upon a variety\r\nof plants. The eggs hatch into curious little caterpillars that have\r\nthe appearance of slugs with small heads which can be extended as if\r\nthe little creature had really a rubber neck. The object of this\r\nextensile head is seen when one finds the larvae feeding upon the\r\nfruits or the seed-pods of its various food plants--hawthorn, hop,\r\nhound's-tongue, and St. John's-wort. The caterpillar is able to thrust\r\nits jaws into the interior of the seed-pods and devour their\r\ncontents. There seem to be generally two broods in a season, even in\r\nthe more northern parts of its range, while toward the south there are\r\nprobably at least three broods. The butterflies are found upon the\r\nwing almost any time in summer, especially from early June until late\r\nin August.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Banded Hair-streak=\r\n  _Thecla calanus_\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most familiar of the delicate little butterflies\r\ngrouped in the genus _Thecla_. It occurs rather commonly in a great\r\nstretch of territory extending from Maine, west to Nebraska, south to\r\nNew Mexico and Texas, and east to Alabama and Georgia. It also occurs\r\nin a limited area on the coast of California. The general color of the\r\nupper surface is a dark brown, which in the male is marked near the\r\nfront edge of the fore wings with a distinct gray patch of scent\r\nscales. The under side is similar in color to the upper except that\r\nthe outer half of the wing is marked by two series of broken lines in\r\nwhite, blue, and brown and a brilliant bit of coloring just in front\r\nof the tail projection of the hind wings; this coloring shows\r\nbeautiful tones of red, blue, and black.\r\n\r\nThese little butterflies may often be seen visiting the midsummer\r\nflowers but are fully as likely to be found along the sides of a shady\r\nroad, where they rest upon the leaves of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous\r\nplants. When disturbed, they fly up in small companies but soon settle\r\nback again into their previous positions. They are lovers of sunshine\r\nand may often be seen upon a leaf, with fully expanded wings, taking\r\na sun-bath. There is but one brood a year, butterflies appearing early\r\nin summer and remaining for several weeks. They lay their tiny pale\r\ngreen eggs upon the leaves of various trees, especially oaks and\r\nhickories, and probably hawthorns. It is not known whether these eggs\r\nremain unhatched as a rule until the following spring, or whether they\r\nsoon hatch and the young caterpillars hibernate without feeding. It is\r\nprobable that both conditions occur. In spring the larvae eat holes in\r\nthe leaves of their food plant and grow rather slowly, gradually\r\nbecoming brown or green slug-like caterpillars about half an inch\r\nlong. They finally change into greenish brown chrysalids from which\r\nthe butterflies emerge in early summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Striped Hair-streak=\r\n  _Thecla liparops_\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern states the distribution of this species is almost the\r\nsame as that of the Banded Hair-streak, but in the Central West the\r\noutline of its region moves northward extending into Canada, above\r\nNorth Dakota, and into Montana and Wyoming. It does not go so far\r\nsouth, however, extending practically only to the southern borders of\r\nKansas and Missouri. The butterfly bears a striking general\r\nresemblance to the other species just named, differing chiefly in the\r\nfact that the under surface of the wings is much more thickly marked\r\nwith broken lines that extend nearer to the body. As a rule, it is not\r\ncommon and consequently it is prized by collectors. Some good\r\nobservers have noticed that it is more likely to be found only on\r\nflowers, instead of sunning itself on leaves. It is single-brooded,\r\nhibernating either in the egg state or in that of the young larvae.\r\nThe food plants are varied, there being good evidence that the\r\ncaterpillar feeds upon all of these: apple, plum, shadbush, blueberry,\r\nholly, chestnut, willow, thorn, and several kinds of oaks. Mr. W. F.\r\nFiske found a chrysalis of this species in the deserted nest of a tent\r\ncaterpillar in New Hampshire in early June, the butterfly emerging\r\nlater in the month.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Acadian Hair-streak=\r\n  _Thecla acadica_\r\n\r\nThis is one of the numerous butterflies that offers some young student\r\nan opportunity to make real contributions to science. It is a\r\nbeautiful little creature, expanding scarcely an inch across its\r\noutstretched wings, found from New England west to Montana along a\r\nrather restricted area, which coincides pretty closely with the\r\nsouthern part of the Transition Zone. There is a form on the Pacific\r\nCoast which is commonly considered to be this same species.\r\n\r\nThese butterflies appear during July and August. They visit various\r\nflowers but are especially likely to be found near willow thickets\r\nalong the borders of brooks and swamps. It is supposed that the eggs\r\nare laid upon the willows and that they remain unhatched until the\r\nfollowing spring. Then they develop into little caterpillars that feed\r\nupon the willow leaves and mature in time to form chrysalids early in\r\nJune. These chrysalids in turn disclose the butterfly early in July.\r\nSo far as I know the eggs themselves and the situation in which they\r\nare laid have never been described.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Olive Hair-streak=\r\n  _Mitoura damon_\r\n\r\nVery few butterflies have the distinction of showing a clear case of\r\nprotective resemblance to one kind of plant in both the adult and the\r\nlarval stages. This is the case, however, with this Olive Hair-streak\r\nwhich is so intimately associated with our common red cedar, that\r\nwhere one is found the other is likely to occur, although both\r\ncaterpillars and butterflies are seldom seen because they resemble the\r\ntwigs of the cedar so closely.\r\n\r\nAlong the Atlantic Coast this little butterfly occurs from New\r\nHampshire to Florida, and westward to a line drawn from Dakota to\r\nTexas. The upper surface of the wings is rather dark olive-brown and\r\nthe under surface, so far as it is exposed when the butterfly is\r\nresting, is of a greenish hue that harmonizes with the green of the\r\nred cedar twigs. There are also, on the under surface, some irregular\r\nlines and dots of red, brown, and white which probably help in\r\nrendering the insect inconspicuous when it is resting among a cluster\r\nof twigs.\r\n\r\nThe yearly history of this beautiful little butterfly differs from\r\nthat of most of its relatives. The species winters in the chrysalis\r\nstate, the first brood of butterflies bursting forth early in May.\r\nThese lay their eggs upon or between the scales of the red cedar\r\ntwigs, especially those which bear flowers. About a week later the\r\neggs hatch into tiny caterpillars that feed upon the scale-like\r\nleaves, continuing to eat and grow for nearly six weeks before they\r\nreach their full size. These caterpillars are so similar in color that\r\nthey are difficult to see, and they have a remarkable protective\r\ndevice in that the first ring behind the head is developed into a\r\nshield which covers the head, hiding it so completely that the\r\nmovement of the jaws in feeding is effectively concealed. Late in June\r\nthey change to chrysalids, part of which appear to remain in this\r\ncondition until the following spring, while most of them give forth a\r\nsecond brood of butterflies in July. These butterflies lay eggs for a\r\nsecond brood of larvae that mature into chrysalids during September,\r\nand hibernate in this condition until the following spring.\r\nConsequently, in the Northern states, the collector should look for\r\nfresh specimens in May and early June and again in July and early\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nThese butterflies visit various flowers, apparently preferring rather\r\nsmall blossoms, such as those of the Mouse-ear Everlasting, which is\r\nin bloom when the first brood is flying, and the various members of\r\nthe mint family, especially spearmint, as well as the sumacs, which\r\nare in bloom when the second brood is on the wing. The time between\r\nflower visits seems to be spent at rest upon the red cedar branches,\r\nand one of the surest ways to find the butterflies is to give these\r\ntrees a sudden jar, which starts them into flight. In fact, they may\r\noften be seen flying around the tops of the cedars a score of feet\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Hair-streaks_\r\n\r\n_Great Purple Hair-streak_ (_Atlides halesus_ or _Thecla halesus_).\r\nWing expanse 1 3/4 inches. Upper wing surface bright blue with\r\nblackish margins, the blackish coloring extending nearly to the middle\r\nin the female. Two distinct tails on each hind wing. Under surface\r\nsepia brown with blue and red spots. Abdomen orange below.\r\n\r\n_White-M Hair-streak_ (_Eupsyche m-album_ or _Thecla m-album_). Wing\r\nexpanse 1 1/3 inches. Upper wing surface blue with wide blackish\r\nmargins in both sexes. Under surface marked with whitish lines\r\nsuggesting the letter M, with a reddish spot near it. Each hind wing\r\nwith two small tails.\r\n\r\n_Least Purple Hair-streak_ (_Calycopis cecrops_ or _Thecla cecrops_).\r\nWing expanse 1 inch or less. Upper wing surface dark brown, more or\r\nless marked with blue, especially at base of front wings and inner\r\nhalf of hind wings. Under wing surface marked with a brilliant red\r\nline edged outside with white. Two very fine tails on hind wings with\r\nbrightly colored spots near their base on lower surface.\r\n\r\n_Gray Hair-streak_ (_Uranotes melinus_ or _Thecla melinus_). Wing\r\nexpanse 1 1/5 inches. Upper wing surface bluish gray with a brilliant\r\nred spot at base of tails on hind wing. Lower wing surface much\r\nlighter gray, each wing marked with a brown and white stripe and a row\r\nof dots nearer the margin.\r\n\r\n_Banded Hair-streak_ (_Thecla calanus_). Wing expanse 1 1/5 inches.\r\nUpper wing surface dull dark brown, commonly without markings although\r\nsometimes there is an orange spot on each hind wing. Lower wing\r\nsurface a little lighter than upper with bright red and blue spots at\r\nthe base of the tiny tails, and with distinct narrow blue and white\r\nbroken bands extending across the outer half of each wing.\r\n\r\n_Striped Hair-streak_ (_Thecla liparops_). Wing expanse 1 inch. Very\r\nsimilar to the Banded Hair-streak, but having more white markings on\r\nthe lower surface of the wings.\r\n\r\n_Acadian Hair-streak_ (_Thecla acadica_). Wing expanse 1 1/3 inches.\r\nUpper wing surface blackish brown with a slaty tinge, and red spots at\r\nbase of the single short tail on each hind wing. Lower surface bluish\r\ngray with many small blackish spots edged with white arranged in two\r\nprincipal rows on the outer half of each wing. Larger orange-red spots\r\non each side of base of the tail on each hind wing.\r\n\r\n_Olive Hair-streak_ (_Mitoura damon_ or _Thecla damon_). Wing expanse\r\n1 inch or less. Upper wing surface olive-brown, more yellow in the\r\nmale than the female. Tips of tiny tails on hind wing whitish. Lower\r\nsurface green except where upper wing is covered by lower: this part\r\nis brown. The green is marked with a row of white spots on each front\r\nwing and two distinct rows of brown and white spots on each hind wing,\r\nwith black spots between.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE COPPERS\r\n\r\nThe members of this tribe are well characterized by their name, for\r\nmost of them show on the upper wing surface tones of coppery brown,\r\nmore or less marked around the margin with darker shades. On the under\r\nside of the tarsi there are numerous spines in irregular clusters. In\r\nthe chrysalis there are curious hair-like projections on the skin,\r\nwhich are short and shaped like tiny toadstools or mushrooms.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the Coppers are very abundant, the majority are rather\r\nrare. Only a few species are sufficiently widely distributed to\r\nrequire description here.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Wanderer=\r\n  _Feniseca tarquinius_\r\n\r\nIn many orders of insects there are whole families whose larvae are\r\nhabitually carnivorous, feeding entirely upon other kinds of insects.\r\nThis is especially so in case of the beetles, the flies, the true\r\nbugs, and the great order to which the bees and wasps belong. Among\r\nthe scale-winged insects, however, carnivorous caterpillars are rare,\r\nseldom occurring among the moths and in hardly more than one species\r\namong the butterflies. This one exception is the modest-looking little\r\nbutterfly fancifully called the Wanderer, perhaps because instead of\r\nfrequenting the flowery fields where other butterflies congregate it\r\nwanders in and out among the alders by brooks and ponds, alighting\r\noftener upon a leaf or twig than upon a flower--the latter apparently\r\nlacking for it the attraction it has for other butterflies.\r\n\r\nIf you watch one of these copper-hued creatures for awhile, however,\r\nyou will soon see that its wandering is not aimless but has rather a\r\nmethod all its own. Perhaps you will see it alight upon an alder twig\r\non or above which you are likely to notice curious woolly white\r\nexcrescences. If you are close enough you will probably see the\r\nbutterfly uncoil its tongue and sip up a liquid on twig or leaf--the\r\nexudations of the woolly aphids that make up the supposed excrescence\r\nand suck the sap from the bark. Much of this sap passes through the\r\nbodies of the aphids and collects in liquid globules on twigs and\r\nleaves, forming a sort of honey-dew which is much sought after by\r\nflies, wasps, and other insects. It seems to form the chief sustenance\r\nof these Wanderers.\r\n\r\nBut many of these butterflies have another purpose besides that of\r\nsipping the honey-dew. Should you watch one of the mother butterflies\r\ncarefully you would be likely to see her alight on or near a colony of\r\nwoolly aphids and run rather rapidly over them in a wasp-like manner,\r\nfinally stopping long enough to lay a tiny, roundish, slightly\r\nflattened egg upon the twig, generally on the under side, and only one\r\nin a place. Then she may continue her way, wandering lazily along the\r\nalder-bordered stream.\r\n\r\nLet us now centre our interest upon the egg. Three or four days later\r\nit hatches into a curious caterpillar. Instead of having mouth parts\r\nfitted for biting leaves as is the case with most butterfly larvae, it\r\nhas one fitted for grasping, piercing, and sucking the juices of the\r\nplump bodies of the aphids, which it finds hard by its place of birth.\r\nIt also has silk spinnerets connected with its mouth, so it is able to\r\nspin a web to shelter it from being run over by its intended victims.\r\n\r\nThe newly hatched larva is not slow to take advantage of the\r\nfacilities with which it is provided. It at once begins to spin a web\r\nabove and around itself, from the end of which it reaches out for the\r\nnearest aphids, sucking their life-blood and casting their empty skins\r\nto the discard of its protecting web. The skins thus serve as an\r\nadditional shelter so that, as the caterpillar moves forward,\r\nincreasing the number of its victims from day to day, it extends its\r\nweb and the protection of the cast skins intermingled with it, while\r\nthrough all--the cast skins, the silken web, and even the hairs on the\r\nbody of the caterpillar--there runs a woof of the woolly\r\nexcretion--effectually concealing the larva from sight.\r\n\r\nThe woolly aphids thus serve as the sole food of the caterpillar\r\nduring its brief life as a larva. Perhaps because of the pre-digested\r\nnature of its food, it is able to mature much sooner than most\r\nbutterfly larvae. In about eleven days after hatching it is ready to\r\nchange to a chrysalis, having undergone during this period only three\r\nmoults, instead of at least four as with other caterpillars. Each\r\ncaterpillar then changes to a chrysalis which is remarkable because\r\nthe form and color of its back bears a striking resemblance to the\r\nface of a miniature monkey. It remains in this condition nearly a\r\nfortnight and then emerges as a butterfly.\r\n\r\nIn New England and the Northern states the short life of the larva\r\nenables this insect to mature three broods each season. Farther south\r\nthere are probably more, for this species is widely distributed in\r\neastern North America, occurring from Nova Scotia to Georgia and west\r\nto the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The American Copper=\r\n  _Heodes hypophlaeas_\r\n\r\nThis little butterfly is one of the most generally abundant insects in\r\nthe northern part of North America. It commonly occurs from ocean to\r\nocean, from the Hudson Bay region to the latitude of Georgia, and it\r\nflies freely in city parks and village yards as well as in the more\r\nopen spaces of field and forest. When seen through a lens it is very\r\nbeautifully colored, the coppery red of the wings being overspread\r\nwith conspicuous black dots and a touch of orange around the outer\r\nborder. The expanded wings measure just about an inch, so that this is\r\none of the smallest of our common butterflies.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillars of the American Copper feed upon sorrel, one of the\r\ncommonest weedy plants of waste places everywhere. The rusty red\r\nblossoms of the sorrel harmonize in color with the color of the\r\nbutterfly, which is frequently to be seen flying slowly above the\r\nplants, stopping now and then to lay its eggs singly upon the leaves\r\nor stems. Each egg soon hatches into a curious caterpillar, which\r\nlooks more like a slug than the usual type of butterfly larva. It\r\nfeeds upon the succulent tissue of the sorrel leaf, at first biting\r\nsmall holes in the under surface. As it gets larger it feeds more\r\nfreely and is likely to make channels instead of holes. It matures in\r\nabout three weeks, changing into a chrysalis under the shelter of a\r\nstone or board. A little later it again changes to a butterfly.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting variation in the number of broods of this\r\nbutterfly each season. In regions where it has been studied it has\r\nbeen found to be double-brooded in northern New England and\r\ntriple-brooded in southern New England and the Atlantic states. It is\r\nprobable that in its far northern home in the Hudson Bay territory it\r\nis only single-brooded. It is thought that the insect hibernates as a\r\nchrysalis.\r\n\r\nThese little butterflies are so small and fly so near the ground that\r\nthey are likely to be overlooked by the casual observer. They\r\nfrequently alight to sun themselves or to sip nectar from many kinds\r\nof flowers. They begin their day's work early in the morning and\r\ncontinue well into the evening. Then they find a roosting-place, head\r\ndownward upon a blade of grass, where they sleep until wakened by the\r\nmorning sunshine.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _From a drawing by W. I.

They are distinguished\r\nfrom the Coppers by this blue coloring, as well as by the fact that\r\nthe spines on the under side of the tarsi are arranged in rows rather\r\nthan in clusters and are comparatively few in number. The body is\r\nrather slender and the under surfaces of the wings are generally\r\ndotted in a characteristic fashion. Most of the two score or more\r\nspecies found in North America occur on the Pacific Coast or in the\r\nSouthwest, less than half a dozen being common in the eastern region.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Spring Azure=\r\n  _Cyaniris ladon_\r\n\r\nFor a wee bit of a gossamer-winged creature that expands scarcely an\r\ninch across its outstretched wings, the Spring Azure has caused\r\nAmerican scientists an immense amount of patient labor. Over the vast\r\nterritory from Labrador across to Alaska and south to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, this little blue butterfly exists in so many different forms\r\nthat it requires special analytical keys to separate them. Not only\r\ndoes it vary geographically so that in one locality we find one form\r\nand in another a different form, but it also varies seasonally to a\r\nmarked degree. As one would expect there is a striking difference in\r\nits annual cycle between Labrador and the Gulf Coast. In the far\r\nnorthern region there is but one brood a year, while in the southern\r\nregion there are at least two and perhaps more.\r\n\r\nThe variations in this butterfly are shown by the differences in the\r\nmarking of both surfaces of the wings. These markings may run from a\r\nfaint blackish border along the extreme margin and a few faint dots\r\nupon the under surface, to a wide black margin around the wings and a\r\ndeep abundant spotting of the under surface. The markings of the\r\nvarious forms are so uniform that the varieties are easily\r\ndistinguished. It is beyond the scope of this book to attempt to\r\ndifferentiate all these varieties but any reader interested will find\r\nan admirable summary of the conditions illustrated by an excellent\r\nplate in Comstock's \"How to Know the Butterflies.\" The species as a\r\nwhole may be known from the fact that the upper surface is blue, the\r\nlower surface ash-gray, more or less spotted with dark brown, and the\r\nwings are without tails. (_See plate, page 256._)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Strange Structures of the Larvae_\r\n\r\nA remarkable variation of the adults is sufficient to give this\r\nspecies a special interest, but the larvae also have a unique\r\nattraction for the naturalist. The mother butterflies lay their eggs\r\nupon the flower buds of various plants, especially those which have\r\nclustered racemes of blossoms. These eggs hatch into minute slug-like\r\nlarvae which feed upon the buds, commonly burrowing through the calyx\r\nlobes and devouring the undeveloped stamens and pistils inside. They\r\nfinally change to chrysalids, which are more or less securely attached\r\nto a central flower stalk, from which in due time the butterflies\r\nemerge. So far there is nothing remarkable about this story of the\r\nlife of the Spring Azure, but that is yet to come.\r\n\r\nThese little caterpillars are subject to attack by tiny parasitic\r\nflies which lay eggs in their bodies. Each egg hatches into a still\r\nmore tiny maggot that lives at the expense of the tissues of the\r\ncaterpillar and finally kills it. When one of these little\r\ncaterpillars has its head buried in the round ball of a flower bud,\r\nabout half of its body is exposed defenseless, so that the little fly\r\nthat lights upon it to lay her egg cannot even be dislodged by the\r\nhead of the caterpillar, as is often the case with other species.\r\nThere is a very curious provision for defense, however. If you look\r\ncarefully through a lens at the hind part of the body you will find a\r\nlittle opening on the back of the seventh abdominal ring. This opening\r\nleads to a sort of tiny pocket, a pocket which the caterpillar can\r\nturn inside out when it so desires. Now the curious thing about it is\r\nthat the caterpillar, while this pocket is concealed in its body, is\r\nable to secrete in it a drop of liquid which we presume to be sweet to\r\nthe taste. When the little pocket is partly filled with this drop of\r\nliquid the caterpillar turns it inside out in such a way that the\r\nliquid drop remains in position on top of the protruded pocket.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you ask what is the good of all this complicated arrangement?\r\nIf you could see what happens when the little drop of what--for lack\r\nof a better name--we shall call honey-dew is exposed, you would begin\r\nto guess the reason. Wherever these larvae are found you will also\r\nfind many ants wandering round among them, and the moment the\r\nhoney-dew appears these ants begin to sip it up. When it is all gone\r\nthe little caterpillar draws in its pocket again and presumably begins\r\nto store up another bit of liquid. It is certainly a curious example\r\nof what the naturalists call symbiosis, which simply means a living\r\ntogether of two animals, each helping the other in some way. In this\r\ncase it is easy enough to see how the caterpillar helps the ant, but\r\nperhaps you are wondering in what possible way the ant may help the\r\ncaterpillar. I hardly dare give the most plausible explanation for\r\nfear some one will cry out, \"Nature-faker!\" But fortunately the\r\nexplanation is based upon at least one precise observation by W. H.\r\nEdwards, one of the most careful and reliable naturalists America has\r\nproduced, who lived before the recent era of Nature-fakers and was\r\nnever accused of sensationalism. Mr. Edwards saw an ant drive away\r\nfrom one of these caterpillars a little parasitic fly which apparently\r\nwas searching for a victim. Consequently, it would appear that the\r\nants helped the caterpillars by protecting them from these arch\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means an isolated example of the relations between ants\r\nand other insects. It has been known for hundreds of years that the\r\nants use the aphids as a sort of domestic milk-producer, attending the\r\naphids at all times and even caring for their eggs throughout the\r\nwinter season. As the plant-lice live in colonies, sucking the sap of\r\ntheir host plant, they are attended by great numbers of ants that\r\nfeed upon the honey-dew which passes through their bodies. In many\r\ncases the ants have been observed to stroke the aphids with their\r\nantennae in a way which seems to induce the aphid to give out a drop\r\nof the sweet liquid for the ant to lap up. In a similar way these ants\r\nseem sometimes to stroke these little caterpillars with their antennae\r\nand thus to induce them to turn their little pockets inside out with\r\nthe drop of liquid at the tip. This is certainly an unusual and most\r\ninteresting relation between two insects far separated by their\r\nstructural characters.\r\n\r\nThe little pocket that I have thus described is situated upon the\r\nseventh segment of the abdomen. Just back of it there are two other\r\nopenings which are even more curious in their structure. These are\r\nprovided with some slender tentacles on which there are circles of\r\nhairy spurs. These structures are a great puzzle to naturalists. It is\r\ndifficult to explain what they are for unless we assume that they\r\nrelate in some way to the honey-dew pocket on the seventh ring. The\r\nonly plausible explanation is that these serve to advertise to the\r\nants, by giving off a distinctive odor, that there is nectar near at\r\nhand to be had for the asking. They would thus be analogous in a way\r\nto the fragrant scent of flowers which is for the purpose of\r\nadvertising to the bee the fact that nectar or pollen or both are near\r\nat hand and may be had for the asking. In the case of these\r\ncaterpillars, however, if this is the true explanation it is a most\r\nwonderful provision and one which would be likely to tax the ingenuity\r\nof man's mind for a long while before it was originated.\r\n\r\nSo this little butterfly which greets us in every spring, like \"a\r\nviolet afloat,\" to quote Mr. Scudder's happy phrase, is full of\r\ninterest at all stages of its existence. It should lead one to a new\r\nrespect for the familiar things in the natural world when one learns\r\nhow baffling to the wits of the wisest scientist is this little\r\ncreature with its protean forms and the wonderful structure of its\r\ncaterpillars.\r\n\r\n\r\n =Scudder's Blue=\r\n  _Rusticus scudderi_\r\n\r\nThis beautiful little butterfly is perhaps the most richly colored of\r\nall our northern Blues. The upper surface of the wings in the male is\r\na nearly uniform hue, except for a narrow dark border around the\r\nmargin. In the female there is, in addition, a series of black-centred\r\norange spots inside of the black border, the series being more\r\nprominent on the hind wings than on the front ones. The under surface\r\nis very pale with distinct marks in black scattered over the basal two\r\nthirds, with a row of orange spots outside of these and another row of\r\nsmall blackish spots just inside of the blackish border stripe.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is a northern species. It occurs in New England, New\r\nYork, and Michigan, and thence extends far north into Canada. The\r\ncaterpillar feeds upon blue lupine and apparently the butterfly is\r\nlikely to be found in most places where this plant grows. The eggs are\r\nlaid upon the leaves or stems and the little caterpillars come out of\r\nthe shells through small holes which they have gnawed.\r\n\r\n\"The caterpillar,\" wrote Mr. Scudder, \"has a very extensible head and\r\nflexible neck, and its manner of feeding immediately after birth is\r\nrather remarkable; it pierces the lower cuticle of the leaf, making a\r\nhole just large enough to introduce its minute head, and then devours\r\nall the interior of the leaf as far as it can reach--many times the\r\ndiameter of the hole--so that when the caterpillar goes elsewhere, the\r\nleaf looks as if marked with a circular blister, having a central\r\nnucleus; the nearly colorless membranes of the leaf being all that is\r\nleft, and at the central entrance to the blister the upper membrane\r\nonly.\" Later in its life it often modifies this feeding habit\r\nsomewhat, and as it approaches full growth it is likely to devour the\r\nentire blade of the leaf.\r\n\r\nThese larvae have the curious nectar-secreting glands on the seventh\r\nabdominal segment which are discussed in connection with the preceding\r\nspecies. Many ants are attracted by this secretion so that it often\r\nhappens that the easiest way to find the caterpillars is to look for\r\nthese attendants. In New England there are two broods of the\r\nbutterfly, one appearing early in June and the other late in July.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Tailed Blue=\r\n  _Everes comyntas_\r\n\r\nThe tiny, threadlike, white-tipped tail projecting from the hind angle\r\nof the hind wings distinguishes this species at sight from any other\r\nfound in eastern North America. The species, however, occurs clear to\r\nthe Pacific Coast and ranges north and south over most of the northern\r\ncontinent. The small slug-like caterpillar feeds upon the flowers of\r\nvarious clovers and other legumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Silvery Blue=\r\n  _Nomiades lygdamus_\r\n\r\nIt would be a distinct privilege to work out the life-history of this\r\nexquisite little butterfly. Although the adult was described as long\r\nago as 1842, the early stages seem to be still unknown. The species\r\noccurs in the South Atlantic states, extending west as far as\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Blues_\r\n\r\n_Tailed Blue_ (_Everes comyntas_ or _Lycaena comyntas_).

The latter includes these two families:\r\n\r\nThe Giant Skippers (_Megathymidae_).\r\n\r\nThe Common Skippers (_Hesperiidae_).\r\n\r\nThese insects as a whole are distinguished from the higher butterflies\r\nby their large moth-like bodies, small wings, hooked antennae (except\r\nin the Giant Skippers), by having five branches of the radius vein\r\narising from the large central cell. The larvae spin slight cocoons in\r\nwhich to pupate and the pupae are rounded rather than angular.\r\n\r\nThe two families are readily distinguished by the differences in their\r\nsize and the structure of the antennae. The Giant Skippers measure two\r\ninches or more across the expanded wings and have comparatively small\r\nheads, with the clubs of the antennae not pointed or recurved. The\r\nCommon Skippers are smaller, and have very large heads with the\r\nantennal clubs drawn out and recurved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT SKIPPERS\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Megathymidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough large in size, the Giant Skippers are few in numbers. Only\r\none genus and five species are listed for North America, and\r\npractically all of these are confined to the Southwestern states and\r\nMexico. Some of them extend as far north as Colorado and as far east\r\nas Florida.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: Megathymus yuccae. Female. (After Riley.)]\r\n\r\nSo far as the story of its life is concerned, the best-known species\r\nis the Yucca-borer Skipper (_Megathymus yuccae_) which was carefully\r\nstudied by the late Dr. C. V. Riley. As will be seen from the picture\r\nabove which represents the adult, natural size, this skipper has a\r\nbody so large as to suggest some of the heavy-bodied moths. The wings\r\nare dark brown, marked with red-brown spots and bands. They fly by day\r\nand when at rest hold the wings erect.\r\n\r\nThese adults lay eggs upon the leaves of Spanish needle or yucca. The\r\neggs soon hatch into little caterpillars which at first roll parts of\r\nthe leaves into cylinders, fastening the sides in place by silken\r\nthreads, and later burrow into the stem and root, often making a\r\ntunnel a foot or more deep. Here the caterpillars remain until full\r\ngrown. They are then nearly four inches long and half an inch in\r\ndiameter. They now pupate in the top of their tunnel and in due season\r\nemerge as adults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON SKIPPERS\r\n\r\nFAMILY _Hesperiidae_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Skippers are the least developed of the butterflies. They show\r\ntheir close relationship to the moths both by their structure and\r\ntheir habits. The larvae make slight cocoons before changing to\r\nchrysalids, and these chrysalids are so rounded that they suggest the\r\npupae of moths rather than those of butterflies. The common\r\nname--Skippers--is due to the habit of the butterflies--a jerky,\r\nskipping flight as they wing their erratic way from flower to flower.\r\n\r\nIn North America the Skipper family includes nearly two hundred\r\nspecies grouped in about forty genera. From this point of view it is\r\nthe largest family of our butterflies, but on account of the small\r\nsize and limited range of most of the species it has by no means the\r\ngeneral importance of such families as the Nymphs, the Swallowtails,\r\nor the Pierids.\r\n\r\nThe Skippers are remarkable for the uniformity of structure in each\r\nstage of existence. The butterflies have small wings and large bodies.\r\nThe broad head bears large eyes without hairs, but with a tuft of\r\ncurving bristles overhanging each. The antennae are hooked at the end\r\nand widely separated at the base. Each short palpus has a large middle\r\njoint and a small joint at the tip. The fore wings project out at the\r\nfront angle and the hind wings are folded along the inner margin.\r\nThere are six well-developed legs in both sexes. The colors are\r\nchiefly various tones of brown, dull rather than bright, and many of\r\nthe forms resemble one another so closely that it is difficult to\r\nseparate them.\r\n\r\nThe Skipper caterpillars have stout bodies and are easily known by the\r\nconstricted neck. Most of these have the habit of making nests from\r\nthe leaves of the food plants, weaving them together with silken\r\nthreads. In a similar way each also makes a slight cocoon when it is\r\nready to change to a chrysalis.\r\n\r\nThe Skippers found in eastern North America are commonly grouped into\r\ntwo types--the Larger Skippers and the Smaller Skippers. The\r\ncharacteristics are given in the paragraph immediately following and\r\nthe one on page 278.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE LARGER SKIPPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe butterflies of this tribe have that part of the club of the\r\nantenna, which is recurved, about as long as the thicker part below\r\nit. As a rule, the abdomen is distinctly shorter than the hind wings.\r\nThe caterpillars are rather short and thick, and the upper part of the\r\nhead, when looked at from in front, is square or roundish rather than\r\ntapering. The chrysalids have the tongue case attached throughout its\r\nlength and stopping short of the tips of the wing cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Silver-spotted Skipper=\r\n  _Epargyreus tityrus_\r\n\r\nOne can seldom draw hard and fast artificial lines in nature. There\r\nare all sorts of intermediate conditions which disturb arbitrary\r\nclassifications. It might seem simple enough to say that some insects\r\nare leaf-rollers and others are tent-makers, but as a matter of fact\r\nin the case of the Silver-spotted Skipper we have an insect which\r\nstarts its larval life as a leaf-roller and finishes it as a\r\ntent-maker. Its life-history is rather interesting and easily\r\nobserved, if one can find the larvae at work upon the leaves of\r\nlocusts and other trees. (_See plates, pages 272-273._)\r\n\r\nThe Silver-spotted Skipper is one of the largest butterflies of the\r\ninteresting group to which it belongs. It lays its eggs upon the upper\r\nsurface of the leaflets of locusts and other plants of the legume\r\nfamily. In less than a week each egg hatches into a little caterpillar\r\nwith a very large head and a comparatively large body, tapering\r\nrapidly toward the hind end. This little creature cuts out from one\r\nside of the leaf a small round flap which it turns over and binds in\r\nplace by silken threads to make a home for itself. This little home\r\nshows considerable variation in its construction but it usually has an\r\narched dome held in place by strands of silk running from the eaten\r\nfragment to the surface of the leaf. It remains an occupant of this\r\nhome until after the second moult. About this time it becomes too\r\nlarge for its house and deserts it to make a new one generally by\r\nfastening together two adjacent leaves. These are attached along the\r\nedges by silken strands in such a way as to give considerable room.\r\nIt leaves one end open as a door out of which the caterpillar crawls\r\nto feed at night upon near-by leaves, returning to the house for\r\nshelter during the day. They continue to use this habitation until\r\nthey are full grown as caterpillars and sometimes they change to\r\nchrysalids within it. More commonly, however, they crawl away both\r\nfrom the leafy case and the tree that bears it and find such shelter\r\nas they can upon the ground near by. Here they spin slight silken\r\ncocoons within which they change to chrysalids. In the more Northern\r\nstates there is but one brood a year, so these chrysalids remain in\r\nposition until early the following summer when they come forth as\r\nbutterflies. Farther south there are two broods each summer, the\r\nsecond brood of butterflies appearing chiefly in August.\r\n\r\nThe Silver-spotted Skipper derives its name from the distinct silvery\r\nspots upon the under-wing surface against a background of dark brown.\r\nThe butterflies appear in the Northern states early in June and remain\r\nupon the wing for several weeks, being found even in August. They fly\r\nvery rapidly and are difficult to catch in an insect net except when\r\nthey are visiting flowers.\r\n\r\nThis species is widely distributed, occurring from ocean to ocean over\r\nnearly the whole of the United States. It extends into Canada only in\r\nthe eastern part and is not found in the Northwestern states.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Long-tailed Skipper=\r\n  _Eudamus proteus_\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most easily recognized of all the Skippers found\r\nin the United States for it is the only one that looks like a\r\nSwallowtail. Its hind wings project backward as long, broad tails in a\r\nway that marks the insect at once as different from anything else. It\r\nexpands nearly two inches and when the front wings are spread at right\r\nangles, the distance from the apex of the front wing to the end of the\r\ntail of the hind wing just about equals the expanse. The general color\r\nis dark brown, with about eight more or less rectangular silvery spots\r\non each front wing.\r\n\r\nThis is distinctly a tropical species which is common along the Gulf\r\nCoast from Mexico to Florida. It ranges north along the Atlantic Coast\r\nto New York City and even to Connecticut. In the South Atlantic states\r\nit is common, but toward the northern limits of its range it is very\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies this butterfly is very common and has been observed\r\nto rest with its wings vertical, the front ones held far back between\r\nthe hind ones and the tails of the latter held at right angles to the\r\nplane of the wings. Apparently, this curious fact was first noted by\r\nDr. G. B. Longstaff. Of course in museum specimens the wings have been\r\nflattened into the same plane during the process of drying, so that\r\nthis peculiarity would not be noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: _Photograph by A.

I. Beecroft_\r\n                                                      _See page 270_\r\n\r\n     THE SILVER-SPOTTED SKIPPER\r\n       Caterpillar, chrysalis and adult]\r\n\r\n\r\n =Juvenal's Dusky-wing=\r\n  _Thanaos juvenalis_\r\n\r\nThere are few trees which have so interesting a set of insects\r\nattacking them as does the oak. It would be a simple matter to find\r\nabundant material for a large volume by making a study of the\r\nlife-histories of the various insects that live upon or within the\r\nvarious tissues of this tree. The leaves alone provide a home for a\r\nremarkably large number of insect species scattered through a great\r\nmany orders and families. The thickened blades seem to furnish an\r\nideal opportunity for many larvae to get their living, and they are\r\nparticularly useful to those which need to make a winter nest.\r\n\r\nBy a little searching almost any time after the middle of June, one is\r\nlikely to find a curious caterpillar home upon some of the oak leaves.\r\nThe margin of the blade has been turned over, generally from above\r\ndownward but sometimes from below upward, and has been fastened down\r\nto the main expanse of the blade by means of golden threads; commonly\r\nthis fastening is not continuous but is more or less intermittent, so\r\nthat the turned-over margin is likely to have an irregular border\r\nwhere it joins the blade. Inside of this tubular construction a rather\r\nunusual looking worm-like caterpillar is probably to be seen. Late in\r\nthe season it will probably be nearly an inch long, with a smooth\r\ngreenish body and a head that may be a bit brownish and more or less\r\nmarked on the sides with orange tones.\r\n\r\nThis is the larva of one of the most widely distributed\r\nSkippers--Juvenal's Dusky-wing. The species is found from southern New\r\nHampshire west to the Great Plains and south to the Gulf of Mexico. In\r\nmost localities it is seldom abundant but yet is so general that it\r\nmay be found by almost every persistent collector. The wings expand\r\nabout an inch and a half and are of a dull brownish color, more or\r\nless marked with darker and lighter spots. Toward the northern limits\r\nof its range there is but one brood a year but farther south there are\r\ntwo, although it is not improbable that some of the caterpillars of\r\nthe first brood remain unchanged throughout the season, so that the\r\ninsect is both single- and double-brooded in the same locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Yearly Cycle_\r\n\r\nThe yearly cycle in southern New Hampshire may be taken as an\r\nillustration of the life of the species in regions where there is but\r\none brood. The butterflies appear in open woods and on cut-over lands\r\nin May and June. They lay eggs upon the twigs of oak trees, one egg in\r\na place and generally near a leaf stem. The egg soon hatches into a\r\nlittle caterpillar that crawls upon a near-by leaf and begins the\r\nconstruction of its tubular nest by bending over the margin and sewing\r\nit with golden silk. It utilizes this nest chiefly as a tent for\r\nresting and sleeping and wanders away from it generally to another\r\nleaf when it is ready to feed. It grows very slowly, having before it\r\nall the weeks of summer to complete its caterpillar growth. As it gets\r\nlarger it needs a new tent and is likely to desert its early one. When\r\nit does this some observers have noted a curious habit. It cuts loose\r\nall the silk that binds the margin of the leaf down upon the blade so\r\nthat the flap is free to spring back to its original position. It\r\nwould be difficult to suggest an adequate explanation for this habit.\r\n\r\nWhen autumn comes our caterpillar is faced with the problem of passing\r\nthrough the winter successfully. It must shelter itself from birds,\r\nspiders, predaceous beetles, and many other enemies. It must find a\r\nmeans of keeping out of the reach of snow and rain, for while it can\r\nsurvive a great degree of cold as long as it keeps dry, it might\r\neasily be killed by freezing up with moisture. But the caterpillar is\r\nable to provide against these dangers. It has apparently an abundant\r\nsupply of liquid silk to secrete from the silk glands in its head, so\r\nit lines its tubular tent with a dense silken web that effectually\r\nexcludes enemies and moisture. It thus has on the outside of its nest\r\nthe thick oak leaf and on the inside a dense soft lining that makes a\r\nmost admirable winter protection. So it remains here throughout the\r\nwinter, the leaf commonly staying on the tree until early spring. Then\r\nleaf, nest, and enclosed caterpillar are likely to drop to the ground\r\nto remain until spring arrives in earnest. Just what happens then\r\nseems to be a bit doubtful. The caterpillar changes to a chrysalis,\r\nbut whether it first works its way out of its winter nest and makes a\r\nnew and less dense covering seems not to be certainly known. Here is\r\nanother good opportunity for some careful observations.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the caterpillar changes to a chrysalis, and late in\r\nspring it changes again to an adult butterfly that flits about on\r\ndusky wing for a few weeks before it dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Sleepy Dusky-wing=\r\n  _Thanaos brizo_\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this butterfly both as to size and marking is very\r\nsimilar to that of Juvenal's Dusky-wing except that the white spots\r\nare not present on the front wing of this species. The life-histories\r\nof the two species as well as their distribution seem to be closely\r\nparallel. The present butterflies are to be found early in summer in\r\nthe same oak barrens as the other, the blueberry blossoms being freely\r\nvisited for nectar by both species.\r\n\r\n\r\n =Persius's Dusky-wing=\r\n  _Thanaos persius_\r\n\r\nThis is a rather small, dark brown Skipper, with a few white spots\r\ntoward the apex of the front wing, but otherwise not marked except for\r\na very pale transverse band which is almost obsolete. The butterfly is\r\nfound from ocean to ocean along the northern tier of states. It also\r\noccurs in the Eastern states as far south as Florida as well as in the\r\nstates along the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nThe food plants of the caterpillars differ from most of those of the\r\nother Skippers. The butterflies lay their yellowish green eggs, one in\r\na place, upon the leaves of willows and poplars. These soon hatch into\r\nlittle caterpillars each of which cuts out a small flap along the\r\nmargin of the leaf and folds it over, fastening it in place with\r\nsilken threads. It thus forms a protecting nest within which it\r\nremains during the day, going forth at night to a neighboring part of\r\nthe same leaf or to another leaf, and feeding upon the green surface\r\ntissues. In this first caterpillar stage it does not eat the veins to\r\nany extent. As it becomes larger it constructs a larger nest and feeds\r\nmore freely upon the leaf tissues. When about half grown it has the\r\ncurious habit of biting out small holes here and there in the blade so\r\nthat the leaf takes on a very unusual appearance. The presence of\r\nthese holes is generally the easiest way to find the caterpillars, for\r\nwhen the holes are seen, a little searching is likely to show one the\r\ncharacteristic tent-like nest.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks the caterpillars become full grown. They then sew\r\nthemselves in for the winter, fastening all of the crevices in the\r\nnest so securely with silken webbing that a very serviceable winter\r\ncocoon is formed. An interesting fact is that this sewing up for the\r\nwinter is likely to take place about midsummer, the caterpillars\r\nremaining quiet from this time until the following spring. The nests\r\nof course fall in autumn with the leaves and the caterpillars remain\r\nunchanged until April or May, when they transform into chrysalids to\r\nemerge in May as butterflies. There appears to be normally but one\r\nbrood a year although there is some evidence of a partial second\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Sooty Wing=\r\n  _Pholisora catullus_\r\n\r\nThis is one of the smallest of the blackish Skippers and may be known\r\nby its small size, expanding less than an inch, and the series of five\r\nwhite dots near the apex of the front wing, these dots being more\r\ndistinct on the under surface. The species is widely distributed,\r\noccurring over practically the whole of the United States, except in\r\nthe states along the Canadian border from Wisconsin west--and in\r\nseveral of these it is found along their southern limits.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is of particular interest because it is one of the\r\ncomparatively few species that habitually occur in gardens and\r\ncultivated fields. The reason for this is that the eggs are laid upon\r\nwhite pigweed or lambs' quarter, the common garden pest of the genus\r\nChenopodium. The eggs are laid singly, generally on the upper surface,\r\nand hatch in about five days into tiny caterpillars that make a little\r\nshelter for themselves by cutting out the edge of a leaf and folding\r\nover the blade, sewing it in place by a few silken threads. Here they\r\nremain and feed upon the green pulp of the succulent leaves either\r\nwithin the nest or near by outside. They remain in these cases until\r\nthe time for the first moult, when they are likely to line the inside\r\nof the silken web before moulting. After this they make new cases for\r\nconcealment and shelter, the cases as they grow older being generally\r\nmade of two or more leaves securely bound together by silken web along\r\ntheir margin. When they become full grown, they spin a silken cocoon\r\nand change to yellowish green chrysalids from which the butterflies\r\nemerge a little more than a week later.\r\n\r\nThis species is supposed to be double-brooded in the north. The\r\nfull-grown caterpillars of the second brood sew up their leafy cases\r\nvery carefully, making them of such thick silken webbing that they are\r\nwatertight. They remain in these coverings until the following spring,\r\nwhen each changes, still within the case, into a chrysalis from which\r\nthe butterfly comes forth in April or May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBE OF THE SMALLER SKIPPERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the members of this tribe the tip beyond the club of the antenna is\r\nshort and the abdomen is long enough to extend as far as or farther\r\nthan the hind wings. The caterpillars have long and slender bodies\r\nwith the upper part of the head, when looked at from in front,\r\ntapering rather than roundish or square. The chrysalids have the\r\ntongue-case free at the tip and projecting beyond the tips of the\r\nwing-cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Tawny-edged Skipper=\r\n  _Thymelicus cernes_\r\n\r\nThis is one of the commonest and most widely distributed of all our\r\nSkippers. It is found from Nova Scotia to British Columbia, south\r\nalong the Rocky Mountains to New Mexico, Texas, and Florida. It is\r\napparently absent west of the Rocky Mountains and along the Gulf Coast\r\nexcept in Florida. Its life-history was carefully worked out by Dr.\r\nJames Fletcher, late entomologist to the Dominion of Canada, and in\r\nthe north may be summarized thus: the butterflies come from the\r\nhibernated chrysalids in May or June. They remain upon the wing for\r\nseveral weeks so that worn specimens may be taken late in July or,\r\nrarely, even early in August. The females lay eggs upon grass blades.\r\nThese eggs hatch about two weeks later, the larvae eating their way\r\nout of the shells so slowly that a whole day may be taken up by the\r\noperation. Each little caterpillar weaves a silken nest for itself, in\r\nwhich it remains concealed most of the time, reaching out to feed upon\r\nadjacent blades of grass but retiring into the nest at the least\r\nalarm. It is a sluggish little creature and grows so slowly that in\r\nthe north it may require more than two months to become full fed as a\r\nlarva. It is then about an inch long and has the characteristic\r\noutlines of the other Skipper larvae, with a black head and a greenish\r\nbrown body. It now spins a cocoon, possibly using its larval nest as\r\na basis, and some time later, before cold weather surely, it changes\r\nto a chrysalis that winters over.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the life of the butterfly in the more northern\r\nparts of its range. Even in New Hampshire there seems to be at least a\r\npartial second brood, and farther south there are probably two regular\r\nbroods with the possibility that a small percentage of the first set\r\nof chrysalids remains unchanged until spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Roadside Skipper=\r\n  _Amblyscirtes vialis_\r\n\r\nThis little butterfly is found apparently in most parts of the United\r\nStates, as it has been collected in New England, California, Texas,\r\nand many intermediate points. Over the northern part of its range\r\nthere is but one brood a year. In New Hampshire the butterflies appear\r\nin May and early June and lay eggs upon the blades of various grasses.\r\nThese hatch about ten days later into slender, silk-spinning\r\ncaterpillars, each of which makes a nest for itself by sewing together\r\nthe margin of one or more grass blades. When the larvae get larger,\r\nthey make larger and denser nests with heavy linings of silken web.\r\nAfter the earlier moults, the thin skin is covered with very fine\r\nsnow-white hairs, between which there is developed a curious whitish\r\nexudation, so that the caterpillars have a flocculent appearance. When\r\nfull grown, they change to delicate green chrysalids which apparently\r\nin the North remain until the following spring before disclosing the\r\nbutterflies. In more southern regions there are two broods each\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n\r\n =The Least Skipper=\r\n  _Ancyloxipha numitor_\r\n\r\nThe Least Skipper differs from the other Skippers both in structure\r\nand habits. Most of these butterflies have thick bodies and a distinct\r\nhook at the end of each antenna. This has a slender body and the\r\nantennae lack the hook. Most Skippers have strong wings and show their\r\nstrength in their rapid, erratic flight. This has feeble wings that\r\nshow their weakness in their slow, straight flight. But from the fact\r\nthat it is about the smallest of all our butterflies, expanding little\r\nmore than three quarters of an inch, it deserves our interested\r\nattention. The tawny wings are so marked with broad margins of dark\r\nbrown that they show the tawny tinge chiefly in the middle spaces.\r\n\r\nOn account of its small size and its retiring habits this little\r\nbutterfly is often overlooked by all but the most experienced\r\ncollectors. It generally flies slowly just above the grass in sunny\r\nplaces in wet meadows and along the open margins of brooks and\r\nmarshes. It rests frequently upon grasses, flowers, or bushes. Mr.\r\nScudder noticed that when resting these butterflies have the curious\r\nhabit of \"moving their antennae in a small circle, the motion of the\r\ntwo alternating; that is, when one is moving in a forward direction,\r\nthe other is passing in a reverse direction.\" This is the sort of\r\nobservation that should challenge us all to sharper wits in watching\r\nliving butterflies. It would be strange if no others thus twirled\r\ntheir feelers in their leisure moments. Who will find out?\r\n\r\nThe female butterflies at least have something to do besides sipping\r\nthe nectar of flowers or idly twirling their feelers. They must lay\r\ntheir eggs and thus provide for the continuation of the species; to do\r\nthis they find suitable blades of grass on which they deposit their\r\ntiny, half-round, smooth yellow eggs. A week or so later each egg\r\nhatches into a dumpy little yellow caterpillar with a black head and a\r\nbody well covered with hairy bristles. This little creature is a silk\r\nspinner and makes a home instinctively by drawing together more or\r\nless the outer edges of a leaf blade and fastening them with\r\ntransverse bands of silk. It then feeds upon the green tissues and as\r\nit grows larger it makes its nest more secure by thicker walls of\r\nsilken web.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown as a caterpillar it changes into a slender chrysalis\r\ngenerally of a grayish red color, thickly dotted with black. About ten\r\ndays later it emerges as a butterfly.\r\n\r\nThe Least Skipper is one of the most widely distributed of all\r\nbutterflies. It occurs from New England to Texas, south to Florida on\r\nthe east coast, and west to the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Abdomen, 4\r\n

addition of periods or commas; application of styling\r\nto headers to match comparable divisions; etc.), the text presented\r\nis that contained in the original printed version. Any unique\r\ngrammatical usage has been retained. Some of the illustrations were\r\nmoved so that paragraphs were not split. Also, some of the text in\r\nthe illustration blocks were rearranged so that they more closely\r\nmatched each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough in there are chacters available for some common fractions\r\ndiplayed in this text (ex., 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4), other fractions (ex., 1/3;\r\n1/5, etc.) are not available. Therefore, it was decided to display\r\nthem all in the format #/#. In the case of mixed fractions, they are\r\ndisplayed as # #/# (ex., 3 1/2).\r\n\r\nTypographical Corrections\r\n\r\n Page  Correction\r\n ===== ====================\r\n  146  similiar => similar\r\n  156  harrisi => harrisii\r\n  194  eing => being\r\n  262  analagous => analogous\r\n  284  Heleconidae => Heliconidae\r\n  283  c. philea   => C. philea\r\n  283  c. agarithe => C. agarithe\r\n   \"   Cercyonis alope 215-228  => 215, 228\r\n  285  Monarch, The     12-223  =>  12, 233\r\n   \"   Nymphalidae     111-214  => 111, 214\r\n   \"   Nymphs, The     111-214  => 111, 214\r\n   \"   Papilionoidea    55-265  =>  55, 265\r\n\r\nEmphasis Notation\r\n\r\n _Text_ - Italic\r\n\r\n =Text= - Bold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Butterflies Worth Knowing, by Clarence M.
