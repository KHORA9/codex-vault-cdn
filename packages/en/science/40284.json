When he thought of her as his wife,\r\nit was frightening. It was as though someone had tossed him a woman and\r\nexpected him to just fall into the routine of marriage. It wouldn't be\r\nhard to come to love this woman, but it would take awhile. Hell, he\r\ndidn't know her. She was a complete stranger who had suddenly told him\r\nthey were married. There was nothing familiar about her; even the\r\nfingers that were softly working over his face were alien.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"_I think we're property..._\"\r\n        --_Charles Fort_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was lying on a strangely made bed, the warm breezes of evening\r\nrolling in off the crashing sea and the woman stood in the ornate\r\ndoorway that entered the bedroom. Her hair was as gold as the noon sun\r\nand her eyes, lifting slightly at the outer curves, were as blue as the\r\nsea. Her lips petaled back over the white strength of her teeth and her\r\nfingers did strange things to make the flimsy robe drop from the rounded\r\nsoftness of her shoulders. Then his fingers curled about the curve of\r\nher thigh. His fingers tightened and the crimson smile broadened; he\r\npulled and felt her resist him with maidenly demureness, but in the end\r\nshe came to him. He felt the yielding firmness of her body pressing down\r\ninto his on the bed and his arms furled about the softness that she\r\noffered. The warm cones of her breasts worked on the hardness of his\r\nchest and his mouth fused against hers for a passionate kiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  SEX LIFE OF THE GODS\r\n\r\n  by MICHAEL KNERR\r\n\r\n\r\n  AN UPTOWN BOOK\r\n\r\n  AN ORIGINAL NOVEL\r\n\r\n\r\n  UPTOWN BOOKS\r\n  are published at\r\n  1213 North Highland Avenue\r\n  Los Angeles 38, California\r\n\r\n  Copyright 1962 by Uptown Publications\r\n\r\n  All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll persons and events portrayed in this book are fictitious. Any\r\nresemblance to persons living or dead, or actual events is purely\r\ncoincidental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nHe left the mother ship and headed for Terra; he smiled at the\r\ninstrument panel and watched the operation of the big scout ship as it\r\nrocketed toward the light ribbon of atmosphere that enveloped the\r\nplanet. It was a joke, in a way. In a manner of speaking, he was the\r\nfirst Terran to fly an alien space ship, but he wasn't thinking of that.\r\nHe was thinking of the woman, Elizabeth Danson of Everett, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nShe was waiting.\r\n\r\nAnd he could see the warmth of her body, sheathed in the web-like gown\r\nthat seemed spun over her turgid breasts and curved hips by an army of\r\nartistic spiders. It would not be a hard thing to love a woman like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHis fingers curled about the controls, his feet working the rudder\r\npedals of the screaming ship as he headed for the strange darkness of\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean. The space ship was operating well and the Earth\r\nlifted her curved bosom to meet his rush.\r\n\r\nTrouble came early. The danger lights flickered in his eyes and the fear\r\nwelled up within him like a flood. Fifteen hundred miles an hour and the\r\nscout ship was out of control! The behavior of the craft was erratic, as\r\nthough a giant hand was slapping the silver belly as he plummeted toward\r\nthe ball of the earth.\r\n\r\nDesperately he tried to reduce the speed of the hurtling ship, his\r\nfingers working the buttons and levers in a frenzy of determination. The\r\ncraft refused to respond. She whipped into a cloud bank, headed for the\r\nsea, lifted suddenly and whirled back toward space.\r\n\r\nIn an agony of fear he realized that he no longer was the master of the\r\nspace ship - he was a prisoner in a violent, uncontrollable meteor that\r\nwould finally slam him into infinity against the very earth that was to\r\nbe home...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the early hours of morning, Jean Renault of Nova Scotia fingered the\r\nwheel of his fifty foot boat through the grey ground swells of the Grand\r\nBanks, almost to the place where he would cast his nets into the water.\r\nThe overcast sky was refusing to emit the sunlight and a light mist hung\r\nover the sea like a disjointed ghost. When Jean heard the whirring roar\r\nof the ship, it was too late. The silver streak whipped over his fishing\r\nboat with all the furies of the gods, and nearly tore his steadying sail\r\naway. Muttering a string of French curses, Jean picked up his radio\r\ntelephone and reported in violent tones the presence of the jet to the\r\nCoast Guard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the half-light of early dawn, the United States and Canada whirled\r\nwith reports upon the strange craft. The CQ of the National Defense\r\nsystem began systematically pinpointing the track of the strange craft\r\nas it raked across the adumbral sky.\r\n\r\nThen, it was gone!\r\n\r\nThe rocketing ship had appeared over one observation station near Lake\r\nOntario. It had been spotted by a CD worker near Auburn, N.Y., then it\r\nwas gone. The last observation of the craft showed it flying an erratic\r\ntrack toward the mountain country of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAt CQ operations office, in Washington D.C., Lt. Colonel Martin Griswold\r\ntossed the last report on his desk and pinched his lower lip\r\nthoughtfully. Colonel Delbert, sitting across from him, looked serious.\r\n\r\n\"It's out of control,\" he mused. \"And it isn't one of ours. Russian?\"\r\n\r\n\"Might be.\" He looked at the rugged country along the Pennsylvania, New\r\nYork map for a moment, then he picked up the phone on his desk. \"This is\r\nColonel Griswold. Get me the Pentagon.\"\r\n\r\nAt 0930 a special plane left Washington, bound for the town in northern\r\nPennsylvania that had been chosen as a base of operations. On board the\r\nplane were the Secret Service men who were to track down the crashed\r\nship.\r\n\r\nThey were several hours too late...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe awakened to flame and smoke and it was as though he had been born\r\nagain. About him lay thick, summer cloaked forests and heavy carpets of\r\nlaurel and brush. Obviously, it was some sort of plane that was burning\r\nnearby and he had probably been in it. In his mind, he remembered only\r\nthe blinding flash of white light, then a sea of darkness that had\r\nenveloped him. Whether he had been thrown clear of the wreck, or whether\r\nhe had crawled, he didn't know. But the torn flying suit he wore\r\nconvinced him that he had once been airborne in that battered craft.\r\n\r\nThe heavy, canvas-like material of the flying suit had protected the\r\nblue serge business suit underneath, so that besides a ripped pocket it\r\nwas presentable. He grinned wryly in the pre-dawn darkness. Presentable\r\nto whom? The squirrels? He peeled off the flying suit and added it to\r\nthe flaming wreckage, then staggered off through the night toward the\r\nvalley below. There was usually, he recalled, water in ravines.\r\n\r\nHe used small saplings for handholds while his head thumped and\r\nthundered wildly. Probing fingers found a lump beneath blood matted hair\r\nthat was sensitive to the touch. There was a scratch on his cheek,\r\nsealed with dried blood, and his hands were skinned as though he had\r\nbroken a fall in cinders with them. It was, he decided, amazing that he\r\nhad survived a plane crash with so little injury; but then, stranger\r\nthings had happened.\r\n\r\nThere was a run at the bottom of the hill, one of those leaf choked,\r\nmeandering little creeks that become stagnant pools in July and August,\r\nand raging torrents of brown water in the spring. Lying on a sloping,\r\nflat rock he thrust his face into the stream and drank deeply, feeling\r\nthe life flow from the water into the weariness of his body. He washed\r\nhis face in it, splashing it over his head until his mind began to\r\nfunction with familiar clarity.\r\n\r\nBut he still did not know who he was...\r\n\r\nWhen he tried to search backward into the past, he could see only the\r\nwhite flash and the darkness. It was frightening. It was as though\r\nsomeone had taken a pair of scissors and cut away the whole memory of\r\nhis past life. He fumbled through his pockets, found the wallet and the\r\ncigarette lighter and began flipping through the cards with the help of\r\nthe tiny lighter flame.\r\n\r\nAn identification card labeled him Nicholas Howard Danson and stated\r\nthat he lived at 2312 Weisman Drive, Everett, Pennsylvania. There was\r\nalso a draft, social security and drivers license card. The others were\r\nmembership certificates to various clubs and organizations. Finally\r\nthere were several pictures of himself and a woman; in fact, there were\r\na great many pictures of the woman. One was a portrait of her,\r\ninscribed, \"love, Beth\", which told him that she was either a girlfriend\r\nor his wife.\r\n\r\nNick extinguished the light and put the wallet away. In his shirt pocket\r\nhe found a crumpled pack of cigarettes. He shook one out, lit it and\r\ndragged the smoke down deep into his lungs while he pondered over his\r\nnewly discovered self.\r\n\r\nOf course the proper thing to do would be to get to a phone, call the\r\nlocal authorities and explain the crash. The law would help him get home\r\nand check him out. That was the proper thing - but he wasn't about to\r\ndo the proper thing. He was a stranger to himself. Who was he? What was\r\nhe? He could well be outside the law, a criminal... Then what? Turn\r\nyourself in, Danson, he grimaced, and discover that you are wanted by\r\nthe law for something? To hell with that. Get to this Beth woman and get\r\nsome answers to a few questions before you bring in the law.\r\n\r\nApparently no one had seen the crash. No one knew he was here. Perhaps\r\nit would be better to leave it like that until he had a chance to find\r\nout just what he was up against.\r\n\r\nHe decided not to contact anyone. When it was light enough he would look\r\nfor a ride to somewhere. At a gas station he could find out where he was\r\nand where Everett, Pennsylvania was. Then, by thumbing, he could get a\r\nride to where he lived. If this Beth woman was his wife, she could fill\r\nhim in. There was plenty of time to call the law.\r\n\r\nSleep, when he tried it, refused to come. There were too many unanswered\r\nquestions rocketing around in his brain. Well, he had to find a road,\r\nsooner or later, so it might as well be now. Perhaps the more distance\r\nhe put between himself and the wreck, the better it would be for him. He\r\ntook a final drink of water from the creek and stood up, his sore,\r\nbattered muscles protesting violently. Then he began to stumble through\r\nthe adumbral forests to find a road.\r\n\r\nIt was getting light when he found the highway. It was small and narrow,\r\nbedded with pebbly asphalt with a faded white line down the middle that\r\ntold him it was not a first class road. It stretched ahead of him,\r\ndwindling among the thick hemlock forests and dwarfed by the steep,\r\nwooded hills. He grinned, wondering vaguely which direction he should\r\ntravel to get to Everett. Finally he pulled a quarter from his pocket\r\nand flipped it into the air. He caught it deftly. Heads, I go to the\r\nright; tails, I go to the left. Heads won and he started off toward the\r\nright, the stiffness and the weariness dragging at him like a weight\r\ntied to his legs.\r\n\r\nWhile he walked he studied the pictures in his wallet, noting happily\r\nthat it also contained twenty dollars in bills. That was comforting.\r\n\r\nIn the daylight, the picture of Beth that had looked pretty in the flame\r\nof the lighter, became beautiful. Although it was a black and white\r\nphoto, Nick decided that her hair was brown. It swept about a soft,\r\nheart shaped face like a cloud. The image was smiling at him and he felt\r\nthat if she was not his wife, he hoped that she was his girl.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the morning when he found the service station. It was a\r\nsmall, lonely, isolated place that sported two pumps and cramped looking\r\nlube rack. Through the open door of the washroom, Nick could see the\r\nshoes and coverall legs of the attendant as they stuck out from under a\r\nFord. Nick found a dime in his pocket and treated himself to a cold\r\ndrink, while he tried to figure out where he was.\r\n\r\nAcross the highway a marker told him that he was on Route 87. He pulled\r\na Pennsylvania map - not entirely sure he was in Pennsylvania - from the\r\nrack inside the door and, unfolding it, found Everett. The route 87 ran\r\nthrough the town, but it was difficult to puzzle out whether he was\r\nnorth or south of the place. He refolded the map and stuffed it into his\r\npocket for further reference, and glanced around. On the far side of the\r\noffice was a door marked \"MEN\", that was just what he wanted. His\r\nclothes, his hair and his face needed a few emergency repairs before he\r\ncould confront the population of Everett.\r\n\r\nHe went in.\r\n\r\nIn a mirror, with most of the backing peeling away, he discovered that\r\nNick Danson was rather good looking, if you overlooked the damage. His\r\nblocky, rugged face was smeared with dirt and dried blood, with a slight\r\nstubble shadowing his lean cheeks. The mop of tangled black hair had a\r\nlot of red splotches in it from the blood he'd lost. He filled the bowl\r\nwith tepid water and began soaping his face and hands vigorously, even\r\nthough it hurt. After washing most of the blood from his hair, he found\r\na comb in a pocket and whipped some order into the matted, dark mass.\r\n\r\nThe attendant was standing at the counter when Nick came out of the\r\nrestroom. He was an elderly man with receding grey hair, a hawk nose and\r\ngrizzled features set firmly into a face that looked like a dried apple.\r\nHe grinned and the gold cap on an eye tooth flashed dully.\r\n\r\n\"Thought I heard someone in here,\" he said around the chew that pouched\r\nhis cheek. \"Car break down on ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm walking,\" Nick told him.\r\n\r\n\"Yer a long way from any kind 'o town, son ... say,\" he said suddenly\r\nnoticing the scratch marks. \"Y' been fightin' a bobcat?\"\r\n\r\nNick shook his head and fished for a lie. \"Got drunk last night and into\r\na brawl. My friends pitched me out of the car in a moment of\r\nplayfulness.\" He hoped he had put enough bitterness into the explanation\r\nto make it ring true.\r\n\r\nThe old man chuckled softly. \"Durned shame, son. Y'from around here?\"\r\n\r\n\"New York,\" Nick lied. \"I'm stayin' in Everett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everett,\" the old man cackled. \"Hell, that's fifteen miles south\r\no'here, or better.\" He paused, swiveled his bird-like head and spat a\r\njet of brown juice through the open door. \"Tell y'what, son, seein's how\r\nyou'll have t'walk it down there. Ain't no one goin' that way, I know\r\nof. S'pose y'could thumb it, but it'd be hard. Lonely road, y'see. If\r\ny'don't mind waitin' till after supper, I'll run y'down to town. Drop\r\ny'off where y'want to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't thought of waiting so long,\" Nick told him. \"What would I do?\r\nJust sit here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell no! In th' back room there's a cot. Been sleepin' there myself\r\nsometimes, since m'wife passed along back in '53. December of '53 it\r\nwas. I'll wake ye, come supper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nWith the hunger gnawing at his stomach, Nick took a cellophane wrapped\r\npie from the counter and began eating it. He handed the old man a\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n\"S'funny,\" the old man said, ringing up the sale, \"ye don't smell like a\r\ndrunk. Ought t'be some likker smell to y'son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was drinking vodka,\" Nick countered, wondering how he had pulled that\r\nfrom a mind that could not remember his past. He took another bite of\r\nthe pie as the old man gave him his change.\r\n\r\n\"Bad stuff, vodka. That's th' slop them Russian hassocks drink, ain't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it ain't for Andy Hocum. Them hassocks can have it.\"\r\n\r\nNick was saved from further conversation by a new station wagon pulling\r\ninto the pumps. A young woman, dressed in a suit, cut the engine and\r\nhonked the horn briefly. Andy waved and headed for the door.\r\n\r\n\"Get some shut eye, son. I'll wake y' later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nHe finished the last of the pie and watched Andy stick a hose into the\r\nwagon's gas tank, then go around front to wipe off the windshield.\r\n\r\nNick cleared the pie wrapper off the small counter and tossed it into a\r\nbox as he headed for the backroom. After closing the door, he fell onto\r\nthe bed and a moment later into the well of sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nDetective Lieutenant Nolan Brice braked the Fairlane at 2312 Weisman\r\nDrive and got out quickly. For a moment, he wasn't sure whether Beth\r\nDanson would be awake, but it was a long drive into headquarters and he\r\ndidn't want to go back to a dismal office, or even a lonely bachelor\r\napartment. He glanced at his watch. 9:30. He shrugged and decided to try\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShe answered his knock almost at once, smiling him into the front room.\r\nFor a moment, he allowed his eyes to finger her body, letting them spear\r\nthrough the wrap around robe and the flimsy nightgown to where warm\r\nflesh ebbed and flowed against the sigh of silk. Her brown hair was\r\nbed-tangled and most of the makeup was gone from her face, but Beth\r\nDanson was a woman who had the unconscious ability to look beautiful\r\nunder any circumstances. Nolan felt a thunder in his veins as he tossed\r\nhis hat on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\"Coffee, Nolan?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe nodded and they went into the kitchen. \"We found the Peters' kid, so\r\nthat ends another case.\" He dropped to a chair and watched her fixing\r\nthe coffee. \"You're up early, Beth.\"\r\n\r\nA shadow crossed her face momentarily. \"I had a dream, Nolan. A bad\r\ndream.\"\r\n\r\n\"About Nick?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded and set a cup of coffee before him. The tears were close\r\nagain, but Brice hadn't seen them fall over Nick for a long while. It\r\nwas ridiculous the way she mooned over the guy, but there was no\r\nunderstanding women.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to stop dwelling on him, honey,\" Nolan told her. \"It doesn't\r\ndo any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's alive,\" she said, softly.\r\n\r\n\"You know better than that. If he was alive, we'd have found him. Men\r\njust do not drop out of sight in the Twentieth Century.\"\r\n\r\nBeth lifted a hand to brush her hair into place and sat down to sip at\r\nher coffee. Nolan studied her. She actually believed that her husband\r\nwas alive and that he would return to her. He hoped not. It was a\r\nselfish thing to think about, but he was in love with her; he'd have had\r\nher long ago if it wouldn't have been for Nick and his dark good looks.\r\nHe mouthed a swallow of coffee and settled the cup in its saucer. She\r\nwas looking at him.\r\n\r\n\"Is there any news, Nolan?\"\r\n\r\n\"About Nick? No.\" He touched her arm. \"They've given up ... and so\r\nshould you. Honey, you're young, beautiful. Hell, another woman would\r\nhave gone out and had a ball.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, there's a lousy show on down in Everett. Want to go?\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled. \"Thanks, but you're probably tired from hunting for the\r\nPeters' kid...\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel fine.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"Nolan, I know how you feel about me. I'm very\r\nflattered. But ... but I have to accustom to his loss in my own way. I'm\r\nsorry.\"\r\n\r\nNolan forced a smile. \"That's the way the mop flops,\" he mused. \"I'll be\r\naround, when you are.\" He finished his coffee in silence. \"Well, I have\r\nto get moving, make out a report and all. Thanks for the coffee, Beth.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, but remained staring into her cup. Nolan went into the front\r\nroom, picked up his hat and went out into the morning to climb into his\r\ncar. When he had started it and headed back toward Everett, he found\r\nhimself struggling with the feeling that he was being cheated.\r\n\r\nAfter all, he reasoned with himself, why should a guy have to play\r\nsecond fiddle to a man who was probably dead. If Nick Danson were alive,\r\nit'd be different; but dead, and that was an almost sure thing, he felt\r\ncheated. Beth could learn to love him. She could forget. Hell, a lot of\r\nwomen lost their men for some reason or another, but they accustomed,\r\nthey altered their lives. If a man dropped the reins, some other guy\r\nshould pick them up. It was only natural.\r\n\r\nHe shut off the thoughts of Beth as he reached the busy section of town\r\nand concentrated on his driving. He could wait, he decided in closing\r\noff the thoughts. Sooner or later she would be ready to accept the\r\ntruth, and he would be right there waiting. He maneuvered the Ford\r\naround several other cars parked in the lot of the City Hall and found\r\nthe berth that bore his name. He killed the engine, got out and went\r\ninside to his office.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened the door and saw the two men and the Chief sitting in his\r\noffice, he knew it was something big. After awhile, it was so you could\r\nspot a Fed a mile away. Especially when they were sitting in your\r\noffice. Chief Daniels looked grouchy at him, but his tone was cordial.\r\n\r\n\"You finish with Peters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nDaniels nodded, his florid, moon face looking lumpy and important.\r\n\"Lieutenant Brice. This is John Cartwell and Sam Morgan. Secret Service.\r\nI've promised to give them assistance in an important matter. They'll\r\nbrief you.\" He nodded an important good-by and left the three of them\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\"What's the problem, gentlemen,\" Nolan said and settled behind his desk.\r\n\r\nCartwell, a stocky looking thirty year old, with wavy blond hair, did\r\nthe talking, while his dark complected friend puffed placidly on a\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant Brice,\" Cartwell said, \"your boss seemed to think that you'd\r\nbe the best man to help us set up our plan of operation. We've already\r\ncontacted the Civil Air Patrol and the National Guard outfit here. We\r\nhave an air search under way and for the meanwhile that's all we can do.\r\nWe were hoping that you could help us get in touch with all the ground\r\nobserving corps' branches; we'll use this office as a headquarters for\r\noperations.\"\r\n\r\nNolan blinked, \"What's up? An Air Force test plane down?\"\r\n\r\nCartwell shook his head. \"We got a UFO report...\"\r\n\r\n\"A flying saucer?\" Nolan was stunned.\r\n\r\nCartwell chuckled and his partner grinned. \"An Unidentified Flying\r\nObject does not necessarily constitute a space craft, Brice. But\r\nsomething was spotted off the Grand Banks, early this morning, going\r\nlike hell and apparently out of control. We got our last sighting over\r\nAuburn, New York. We checked the observation posts around Everett and\r\nfound that nothing was seen. We also checked Binghamton and Elmira, with\r\na negative report. Since the object was on a southerly heading, when\r\nspotted near Auburn, we can only assume that it went down in the area\r\nbetween Everett and Auburn, and Binghamton and Elmira.\"\r\n\r\nNolan gave a long low whistle. \"Not one of ours, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Canadian?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at that speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That leaves the big one, then. Russian?\"\r\n\r\nCartwell shrugged. \"Could be. If it is, we want the wreckage. No matter\r\nwhat it is, or whose it is, we are very interested in any aircraft that\r\ntravels at speeds of fifteen to nineteen thousand miles per hour.\"\r\n\r\nNolan whistled again. \"That's rolling,\" he grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" mused Sam Morgan, \"and we'd kind of like to know what makes it\r\nroll like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay. Let's go into a huddle,\" Nolan said. \"But I can tell you this. If\r\nthe thing went down in north central Pennsylvania, it's in some pretty\r\nrugged country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great,\" Cartwell snarled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dream was of a woman.\r\n\r\nHe was lying on a strangely made bed, the warm breezes of evening\r\nrolling in off the crashing sea and the woman stood in the ornate\r\ndoorway that entered the bedroom. About him lay all manner of bright\r\nsilks and strange colored cloths. The woman smiled and his eyes caressed\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHer hair was as gold as the noon sun and her eyes, lifting slightly at\r\nthe outer corners, were as blue as the sea. Her lips petaled back over\r\nthe white strength of her teeth and her fingers did strange things to\r\nmake the flimsy robe drop from the rounded softness of her shoulders. He\r\nwatched her walk, upon curvaceous legs, to the edge of the bed. For just\r\na second, she smiled down at him.\r\n\r\n\"Father is sleeping like a baby,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe felt himself talk: \"Good.\" Then his fingers curled about the curve of\r\nher thigh. His fingers tightened and the crimson smile broadened; he\r\npulled and felt her resist him with maidenly demureness, but in the end\r\nshe came to him.\r\n\r\nHe felt the yielding firmness of her body pressing down into his on the\r\nbed and his arms furled about the softness that she offered. The warm\r\ncones of her breasts worked on the hardness of his chest and his mouth\r\nfused against hers in a passionate kiss.\r\n\r\n\"Lors, Lors, darling. You've been gone so long.\" Her voice was a kitten\r\npurr in his ear, warm and gentle.\r\n\r\n\"I'm back, Jela,\" he smiled, his hands caressing the lithe length of her\r\nbody, folding her against him tightly.\r\n\r\nShe moved away from him, rolling, tugging at him to respond, but he\r\nneeded no encouragement. His body rolled with her, his arms pinning her\r\nto him tightly so that she could move nothing ... nothing but her legs,\r\nbut then there was little need to move anything else...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dream faded and he cursed, and tried to get back to sleep and the\r\nbeautiful woman who awaited him. Sleep came, but the dream was gone.\r\n\r\nAndy, shaking his shoulder, woke him about sundown and Nick swung his\r\nlegs off the cot and stood up. Still sleepy, he fingered the heavy\r\nstubble on his face and looked at the old man.\r\n\r\n\"Y'kin use my razor t'chop off that beard, son,\" he said. \"C'mon, get\r\naround now. Got soup and sandwiches ready an' some famous Hocum coffee.\"\r\n\r\nNick straightened his wrinkled clothing, shaking the last remnants of\r\nweary fog from his brain. Andy went on talking to him and said something\r\nthat woke Nick Danson up completely.\r\n\r\n\"Yer buddies was here, couple o' hours ago, son.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" It was almost impossible to keep the surprise out of his face\r\nand voice. Andy didn't seem to notice anything wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Th' fellers y'got drunk with. Wanted t'know if I'd seen any strangers\r\non th' road. I said I hadn't, 'cause I figgered they might want t'slap\r\ny'around again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Andy.\"\r\n\r\nWho could possibly know about the plane crash? If the wreck _had_ been\r\nfound, it would be the police asking questions, not two strangers.\r\nSomebody, somewhere, was searching for him. Who? And what did they want?\r\n\r\nFingers of fear and worry flittered along his spine.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished eating, Nick shaved, cleaned himself up and\r\nfollowed Andy out to where his car was parked. He found that he liked\r\nthe old man, but under the circumstances conversation was difficult. The\r\nplane crash, for one thing, was a bit on the odd side. The burning\r\nwreckage, he recalled, had shown no signs of ever having had wings or a\r\ntail assembly. But that was probably minor; the wings could have been\r\nripped off by the trees when the plane came down. The important thing\r\nwas that someone knew he was here. As they drove toward the town of\r\nEverett, the old man began talking about the strangers that had inquired\r\nafter Nick earlier in the day.\r\n\r\n\"... Nope, I says to the big feller, ain't seen a soul on foot all day,\r\n'ceptin' o'course, Jimmy Dilson, goin' down t'Willer Creek, t'fish. That\r\nseemed t'satisfy them so they lit out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Notice what kind of car they drove, Andy?\" Nick asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yep. Gave 'em gas. They was drivin' a Chevrolet. Looked to be a '56 or\r\na '57; black, it was. Blacker'n th' inside of a coal bin, with th'\r\nshiniest chrome y'ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like them,\" Nick told him, enlarging the lie. \"One of them short\r\nand the other medium?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly. The one did all the talkin' had a funny accent. Anyways,\r\nhe was about six feet, three or four, and heavy. Goodlookin', with\r\nblond hair. The other guy was about your build, with sandy hair. Never\r\ntalked, that guy.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're the ones,\" Nick lied and shook a cigarette from a half empty\r\npack. \"Thanks for not giving me away.\"\r\n\r\nAndy nodded, lapsing into silence, while Nick concentrated on coming\r\nhome to a strange woman, and the two men who had been asking after him.\r\nFor some reason, he got the feeling that Beth Danson was his wife and he\r\naccepted it that way. She couldn't be his sister ... besides, a man his\r\nage would be married, in all likelihood. He wondered vaguely how she\r\nwould welcome him, but cast the thought aside. He'd know soon enough.\r\n\r\nAs they approached Everett, in the gathering twilight, Andy turned to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Where d'ye want off, son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Weisman Drive. Know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yep. We're almost there. Suburban area, just north of town. Y'got\r\nfriends there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" Nick grinned inwardly. That is, he thought, I hope she's a\r\nfriend. Hell, I don't know whether she hates my guts, or loves me ...\r\nbut she's the only one that can help. A frightening gloom fell over him\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\nAndy lapsed again into silence and the sound of the motor became loud.\r\nNick continued to ponder the strange men and the woman he was coming\r\nhome to, but it was like bashing his head against a wall. He could\r\nremember nothing. And, through his thoughts, the memory of the dream\r\nreturned to him. It was the most vivid dream he had ever had, almost as\r\nthough it was real.\r\n\r\nAbruptly Andy brought the car to a stop before a sign that read,\r\n\"Weisman Drive.\" Nick thanked him and climbed out onto the road. The old\r\nman waved and the car spat cinders as it roared back onto the highway,\r\nheading toward the town. For a moment, he stood there watching Andy's\r\ncar fade into the night, then he began walking along the road, looking\r\nfor 2312 Weisman Drive and trying to ignore the feeling of fear that\r\nwelled up within him.\r\n\r\nWhen he finally found it, he saw that it was a two story place that\r\nlooked to be white frame, trimmed with a darker color that was probably\r\nblue. In the off light from the street lamp, it was difficult to tell.\r\nThere was a garage built alongside and a good sized lawn in the front,\r\nbut there was no evidence of children. A light in the front room told\r\nhim that someone was home - likely Beth - and caution told him he'd\r\nbetter make sure no friends were with her.\r\n\r\nHe slipped quietly up on the porch and looked briefly into the window.\r\nBeth was there, sitting on the sofa reading a book. Her hair, he\r\nnoticed, was brown with a reddish cast to it and she was every bit as\r\nbeautiful as the picture he carried in his hip pocket.\r\n\r\nHe knocked on the door.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him, after he had rapped, that this was his own house.\r\nWhy should he rap? But what was done, was done. He waited until she had\r\nopened the door and stood looking at him. He tried a smile, but Beth\r\nDanson's eyes widened in shock and her lips parted in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Nick,\" she whispered, as though she had seen a ghost, and fell to the\r\nfloor in a dead faint.\r\n\r\nStunned, he stepped over the crumpled body of the woman and walked into\r\nthe room. When he had closed the front door, he lifted her limp body and\r\nlaid her on the sofa. He began patting her face and hands to revive her,\r\nwondering what the hell he had done to cause her to faint.\r\n\r\nWhy the devil was she so shocked to see him, he wondered. Is she in love\r\nwith another man and did they rig that plane so it would crash to be rid\r\nof me? If they had tried to kill him, he could damned well see why she\r\nhad fainted at the sight of him. The rings on her left hand bragged that\r\nshe was married, probably to him. But why faint?\r\n\r\nHe was trying to decide whether to stay or run, when her long lashes\r\nfluttered and she came to. Again her greenish eyes dilated in\r\nastonishment, but this time she did not pass out. Her soft arms slid\r\nabout his neck and she pulled him down to where she could kiss him. Her\r\nwarm lips caressed his face, kissing his mouth, his cheeks and his eyes,\r\nwhile she murmured his name over and over in absolute joy.\r\n\r\nHad news of the crash reached her? Did the authorities find the wreck\r\nand presume him dead? Was that why she had fainted and was now so\r\noverjoyed at having him back? His mind whirled with a hundred questions\r\nthat his stunted memory refused to answer, and he decided to take it\r\neasy, waiting for her to make the first move.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Nick,\" she murmured against his ear. \"Where have you been?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I've been in a crack up, Beth. I can't remember\r\nanything...\"\r\n\r\nShe pushed him away, suddenly, looking at his face. \"Darling! Your face!\r\nYou're hurt!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just scratches,\" he told her swiftly. \"Nothing serious. Beth, you've\r\ngot to help me. Please!\" He felt strange. It was like asking a total\r\nstranger for help, and he was ashamed and confused.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I'll help you, darling. I'm your wife. Now come out to the\r\nkitchen where I can patch you up.\" Suddenly she burst into tears and\r\nheld him close. \"Oh, darling, darling! It's so good to have you back!\"\r\n\r\nHe held her until she had stopped crying, then he allowed himself to be\r\nled into the kitchen where she began applying iodine and bandaids to his\r\nscratched face. Weariness was again dragging at him like some clutching\r\ndemon that threatened to drag him down into a bog of darkness. He\r\nstudied her, trying to take his mind off his lethargy.\r\n\r\nBeth Danson was about twenty-five and, besides her deep auburn-brown\r\nhair and lovely face, she boasted an equally attractive body. He found\r\nhimself captivated by the warm thrust of her breasts beneath the silk\r\nblouse. The clear milk of her flesh, at the \"V\" of her throat excited\r\nhim in a strange way. When he thought of her as his wife, it was\r\nfrightening. It was as though someone had tossed him a woman and\r\nexpected him to just fall into the routine of marriage. It wouldn't be\r\nhard to come to love this woman, but it would take awhile. Hell, he\r\ndidn't know her. She was a complete stranger who had suddenly told him\r\nthey were married. There was nothing familiar about her; even the\r\nfingers that were softly working over his face were alien.\r\n\r\nAlien! That's it! The whole damned world is alien, and I don't know who\r\nI am, who I've been...\r\n\r\n\"Beth?\" He asked suddenly, \"how long have I been gone? You act as though\r\nit's been a long while...\"\r\n\r\n\"A long while, darling.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked steadily at him for a moment, her eyes deep with seriousness.\r\n\"Thirteen months,\" she whispered, her voice shaking.\r\n\r\nThirteen months! He relaxed heavily in the straight backed chair and\r\nstared at her dumbfoundedly. Over a year! Where had he been? What had he\r\ndone? Why hadn't he been located before now?\r\n\r\n\"Thirteen months,\" he croaked, unable to say anything else.\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"Oh, Nick, every police agency in the country has been\r\nlooking for you. I've had detectives out hunting. Nolan Brice has been\r\ndoing everything he can to locate you. But they couldn't. No one could.\r\nIt was as though you had disappeared from the face of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nolan Brice?\" Nick asked.\r\n\r\n\"Your best friend...\" When she realized that he knew nothing of the man,\r\nNick could see her starting to cry. Her eyes began filling and he could\r\nalmost see the hopelessness within her.\r\n\r\n\"Please, honey. Don't start crying again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm trying not to.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet slowly, his head starting to thump and thunder\r\nagain, and took her into his arms. It was kind of difficult, trying to\r\ncomfort her the way a husband should, but he tried.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Beth,\" he whispered against her cheek. \"It'll all come back to\r\nme. It'll all come back eventually and I'll remember. But for now ...\r\nfor now, you'll have to bear with me. I don't know where I've been, or\r\nwhat I've done, so don't tell anyone I'm here. Please! Don't tell a\r\nsingle soul! No one!\"\r\n\r\n\"But why, Nick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I could have killed someone. I could be a thief, a desperado or\r\nsomething. I don't know. I could even have gotten married...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, darling!\" She collapsed on his shoulder and began crying violently\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Honey, honey! I didn't say that's what I've done. It's just that I\r\ndon't know. Whatever I am, I can take my medicine, but I want to know\r\nwhat it is first. You've got to understand that.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried a smile, blinking back the tears that lay close to the\r\nsurface, and he forced a smile to pull at his mouth. It was difficult to\r\ncomfort her, yet he knew that it was his duty to do so. She'd been\r\nthrough a hell of a lot, _and_ she had the memories of it. He did not.\r\nDespite the alien feeling that was welling within him, he knew that she\r\nwas the only person who could help him return to himself. Whether he\r\nloved her or not was immaterial; he needed her desperately to show him\r\nto the man he was. Perhaps it would all come back then.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Nick. I'll try to help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hungry?\" She asked brightly, moving to turn the flame on under the\r\ncoffee pot. At his nod, she went on: \"There's some apple pie and I can\r\nwhip up a couple of sandwiches, or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Coffee and pie is fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a way, it'll be like courting all over again,\" she told him, in an\r\nattempt at lightness. \"It's terrible to lose the things we had, the\r\nmemories. I can't share them with you anymore. But we'll make a whole\r\nlot of new ones to take their place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm interested in the old ones right now,\" he told her glumly. \"Things\r\nhave happened so fast, it's hard to accustom to the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she mused, working over the meal.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her steadily. \"Beth? When did you last see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirteen months ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. I mean, where was I going, what was I doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were going up to the cabin to repair the fireplace and build some\r\nlawn furniture. You were going to stay over night and come back the\r\nevening of the second day. When you didn't come back, Nolan took me up\r\nto look for you. Your car was there, but you were gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"No clues?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"Nothing. We thought you might have wandered off\r\ninto the woods and injured yourself; but I couldn't accept that. You\r\nwere always a good woodsman, even in desolate country like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Secluded, huh?\" He asked.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the worst country in the state. We bought the place so we could\r\nget away from the mess in the city.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her. Apparently they had gotten away from one mess merely\r\nto fall victim to another.\r\n\r\nShe sliced him a huge piece of pie and set it before him, the same brave\r\nsmile still fixed upon her lips. Then she fixed the coffee for him,\r\nblack with a lump of sugar. He forked some of the pie into his mouth and\r\nfelt a little sick, along with the headache. A stranger feeding him and\r\nloving him, and who knew more about him than he did. He bolted the pie\r\nand gulped the coffee hurriedly. When he had finished, he glanced at the\r\nelectric clock above the pink refrigerator. 9:15.\r\n\r\n\"Tired, dear?\" She asked.\r\n\r\nHe nodded dully. Now, he thought, I suppose I'm to crawl into bed with\r\nher! He felt trapped, suddenly panic stricken at the thought; but she\r\nwas his wife. He'd married her. He'd probably slept with her thirteen\r\nmonths before. Why the horror?\r\n\r\n\"We'll go to bed now,\" she decided. \"I usually turn in early. Have to\r\nwork, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll sleep on the sofa,\" Nick mumbled.\r\n\r\nShe blinked at him. \"You'll do no such thing. You'll march right\r\nupstairs to bed, Nick Danson.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the die, he figured, was cast...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the final analysis, he was just too tired to attempt an explanation -\r\nnot physically worn out, but mentally. Since just before dawn, he felt\r\nas though he had been on a fantastic merry-go-round. Feeling a bit\r\nstrange, he allowed her to lead him upstairs to the bedroom. The sight\r\nof one bed startled him, even though it was a rather large double. He\r\nslid eyes sideways, caught her smiling coyly and forced a grin. She\r\ninstalled him in the bathroom, tossed a pair of pajamas to him and left\r\nhim alone.\r\n\r\nHe took a long time showering and shaving. Then when he could avoid it\r\nno longer, he went into the bedroom. She was combing her long satiny\r\nhair at the dresser and had slipped into an aqua colored nightgown. For\r\na moment, his breath caught in amazement, then he slid between the\r\nsheets of the bed and watched her. Finally she stopped combing and\r\nwalked over to look down at him. He looked back, feeling a little like a\r\ncaged animal - but enjoying it.\r\n\r\nShe fell to her knees beside the bed, her eyes shining with happiness.\r\nThe red lipped smile was again tugging at her full mouth. Her fingers\r\nwound gently in his hair and the warm pressure of her soft breasts\r\nrested boldly upon his arm as though they knew they belonged there.\r\n\r\n\"I love you so much, Nick,\" she whispered, her eyes half closed.\r\n\r\nHe reached out a hand to touch her cheek and the softness of it against\r\nhis fingers alarmed him, thrilled him. He knew what he had to tell her,\r\nbut it was a long time in coming. \"I ... I love you too, Beth,\" he\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\nHer soft, moist lips came gently down upon his like a twin promise of\r\nthe offering of love that awaited him and he felt his own lips\r\nresponding. A slight tremor ran through him as her fingers flicked at\r\nthe wall and the room became sheathed in darkness. Moonlight filtered\r\nthrough the curtains and she moved into the bed, her lithe shape molding\r\ninto the hardness of his. Her voice was a warm breath in his ear and her\r\narms slid over his chest while she talked.\r\n\r\n\"You don't love me, darling. That's the whole trouble. We love with our\r\nminds, and love is an accumulation of a million memories - but you have\r\nlost yours. I know, I know. To you...\"\r\n\r\n\"Beth,\" he began but she clamped her hand over his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"To you, darling, I'm a stranger, just another woman. I know I can't be\r\nanything more right now. You'll have to learn to love me again.\r\n\r\n\"But me? Nick, it's different with me. I've waited for thirteen long\r\nmonths for you to love me again, and by some miracle you've come back.\r\nYou're here and so am I. I love you and I want you. Oh, darling, pretend\r\nI'm a whore; pretend I'm anything ... but make love to me. Pay no\r\nattention to anything except to me...\"\r\n\r\nHis mouth folded over hers, shutting off the flow of words in a\r\npassionate kiss, while his hands smoothed down over the wisp of silk\r\nthat kept his fingers from her flesh. Her arms clung to him tightly.\r\n\r\n\"It won't be hard, Beth,\" he whispered against the side of her face.\r\n\"You're beautiful ... it won't be hard to love you...\"\r\n\r\nThen she twisted from him, making a memory of the film of nightgown\r\nthat had kept his hands away from her. He moved to her, his fingers\r\nstroking her into passion while she pulled his face down to the soft\r\nthrust of her breasts. Then she was clamped against him and struggling\r\nto get even closer, her body making a prison for him ... yet at the same\r\ntime giving him freedom.\r\n\r\nLater, when she slept, he propped himself on one elbow to study the soft\r\nlines of her face. Then he too dropped off to sleep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis uniform was torn by the purple bushes and their nine inch thorns,\r\nand streamers of blood painted the rich blue and yellow of his trousers.\r\nHis face was smeared with grey, pasty dirt and the hand that held the\r\nauto-pistol was wet with sweat. His stomach had rolled into a tight ball\r\nwithin him and he was frightened.\r\n\r\nThey were out there somewhere, waiting for the sound of his black\r\nleather boots to clatter on one of the grey-green rocks that littered\r\nthe hillside. They would find him. Their damned radar antennae would\r\nspot him for them. There was no escape from the bastards, and he knew\r\nit. Commander Imry had bungled every damned assignment he'd been given,\r\nand now Firstspacer Lors would have to die in the supreme bungle that\r\nhad created the first native uprising on Thista. He looked up along the\r\nface of the high mountain in his rear. Nothing moved in the\r\ngreenish-purple scrub, but he knew they were there.\r\n\r\nHe peered over the edge of the rock into the valley, a hundred and fifty\r\n_kinos_ away. The patrol car was still there, its driver lying\r\ngrotesquely just a few feet from the hatch. The thick, heavy spear\r\nthrough his chest resembled a finger pointing toward the violet sky.\r\nCloser to him, on the slope, one of the enemy lay dying, a\r\ngreenish-brown fluid pumping spasmodically from the hole put in his\r\nchest by the auto-pistol. The alien's huge yellow eyes blinked owlishly\r\nand the slash-like mouth worked as if he wanted to call for help. But no\r\nsound came. The antennae swiveled limply as he tried to locate his\r\ncomrades, but they drooped as the alien died.\r\n\r\nStill tightly clutching the auto-pistol, he watched the thin, grey\r\nantennae fall to the ground. They pointed off to the left. He swung\r\nabout and looked in the direction the native had been scanning, but he\r\ncould see no movement beyond the swaying of the desert grass moving in\r\nthe faint breath of air.\r\n\r\nThey should have gotten the message. By now, there was probably a ship\r\non its way to him. He had to hold out until they got here. He flipped\r\nopen the cartridge box and checked his ammunition. Plenty. Of course,\r\nthe auto-pistol only held fifteen shots and if they rushed him... He\r\nwished fervently that he had thought to bring the projectile launcher\r\nfrom the wrecked patrol car.\r\n\r\nDamned natives and their uprisings!\r\n\r\nHe searched the sky anxiously, cold sweat trickling off his forehead in\r\ntiny rivulets. Scenes of other uprisings flickered through his brain,\r\nand more horrible scenes of the remains of tortured captives when he\r\nreached them too late. Those had been small. This one was for real.\r\n\r\nThe native seemed to materialize out of the ground, screaming shrill\r\nobscenities as he drew himself to his full nine feet of height and\r\nbrandished the heavy maul over his head. He came leaping over the ground\r\nand up the hill of tumbled rocks in fiendish rage, his grey antennae\r\npointed directly at Firstspacer Lors. Behind him came the others, eight\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nHe fired the auto-pistol at the lead alien, watching the bullet tear a\r\nhole in his face, ripping away one of the blinking yellow eyes. The\r\nalien screamed and fell blubbering. He fired again and again, dropping\r\ntwo more before the charge broke.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, at a sound, he whirled and stared terrified at the alien\r\nbehind him. The charge had been a fake, an old military stunt that any\r\ngreen Spacer could have seen through. For one brief instant, he stared\r\ninto the large eyes of the native. Then he fired. Another native rose\r\nfrom the ground, then another and another. He fired repeatedly, crying\r\nand cursing in his rage at the weapon's inefficiency, while over his\r\nhead he heard the roaring of the rescue ship.\r\n\r\nTongues of flame soared over his head and into the surging mass of\r\naliens. He hoped the ship was not too late...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Nick! Nick, darling!\"\r\n\r\nHe awoke, his face drenched with sweat and his stomach a tight knot of\r\nfear. He reached out, in his fright, and grabbed the woman at his side,\r\npulling her into his arms to hold her tightly. She stroked his hair,\r\nkissed his face and whispered soothing words into his ear.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Nick?\"\r\n\r\nHe relaxed his grip and laid his head back on the pillow. In the bright\r\nlight of the moon, he looked at her and returned to himself. Those\r\nmonsters! So vivid!\r\n\r\n\"Nightmare,\" he croaked hoarsely.\r\n\r\nShe smiled, her lips glistening in the moonlight, and kissed him gently.\r\n\"The apple pie,\" she suggested. \"Nightmares are usually caused by eating\r\nbefore bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was so real,\" he muttered. \"So real. I ... I was on another planet\r\n... I wore a blue uniform with yellow stripes on the legs and my name\r\nwas Lors, or Lars. The natives, horrible monsters, were in a state of\r\nrevolution ... they killed my driver. I was alone and they were all\r\naround me...\"\r\n\r\n\"Science fiction,\" she cooed and stroked his hair. \"I think it's a good\r\nsign. All you ever read, for relaxation, was science fiction. Your dream\r\nwas probably a story you once read and your mind put you in the hero's\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat up and looked at her. \"Did I cry out?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were mumbling. I couldn't hear what you said. Then you began\r\nsobbing and thrashing about.\"\r\n\r\nNick ran his fingers through his hair and over the back of his neck, the\r\nreality of the dream almost too much for him. It wasn't an ordinary\r\nnightmare where he would be running, with a huge monster panting in\r\npursuit. This was frightening. Like a memory. Like some damned fantastic\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nHe stood up and patted her shoulder. \"Go back to sleep, Beth,\" he told\r\nher gently. \"I'm going downstairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I turn on a light?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It might cause the neighbors to wonder.\" He walked to the door of\r\nthe bedroom. \"The moon is bright enough.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked into the hall, feeling his way in the dark places, and down\r\nthe stairs into the living room. As he sat in the chair near the window,\r\nhe thought about the dream. It bothered him, because it was unlike a\r\ndream; it had the weird consistency and logic of a memory, yet seemed\r\nalmost supernatural ... Hell, what kind of thing had huge, yellow eyes\r\nand stood nine feet tall? What sort of a world had a violet sky and\r\ngrey-green rocks? The whole damned thing had the scent of a Walt Disney\r\nmovie, the colors vivid and sharp, the landscape seemingly done by a\r\nwatercolor brush.\r\n\r\n_Thista._\r\n\r\nApparently it was some kind of planet and he hoped that Beth was right.\r\nWould it be possible for a man to get so confused via a crack on the\r\nhead, that he believed he had lived through the literature he'd once\r\nread? What would he dream about next? _Macbeth?_ _Treasure Island?_\r\nChrist, what a world!\r\n\r\nIf he could get to a doctor, a headshrinker, it might all be ironed out.\r\nThey would get things squared away in a short while, but hell ...\r\nsuppose I'm Public Enemy Number One, or something. Thirteen months! In\r\nthirteen months kings have been broken, dynasties crushed ... What had\r\nhappened to him in the thirteen months that he had been out of touch?\r\nOne thing he was sure of; he hadn't been laying around. In a stretch of\r\ntime like that, he had worked, eaten, slept, loved ... Maybe he had\r\nmarried again! An almost comical thought, compared to the possibility\r\nthat he could be a killer, a bank robber; there were a million things\r\nhe could have done.\r\n\r\nA psychologist? Nope. That was out of the question, until he knew more\r\nabout Nicholas Danson. And learning more about himself would be a real\r\nproblem. The cabin that Beth had spoken of would probably show him\r\nnothing. After a period of a year, there would be damned little trail\r\nleft to hunt along. There would be almost nothing. Whatever had been\r\nthere, would have probably been sifted through by the guy, the\r\ndetective, Nolan Brice. Brice! Of all the friends for him to have, he\r\nhad to be saddled to Brice! He'd have to be real careful where that\r\ncharacter was concerned because the slightest slip would set the cop on\r\nhis trail like a blood hound.\r\n\r\nThe crackup? Now there was something. He would always be stuck with the\r\nquestion of how he had managed to get out of that mangled mass of metal\r\nwith merely cuts and bruises. But he could chalk that up to dumb luck,\r\nor something. The thing that worried him was had he left a clue that\r\ncould trace him here? He had burned the flying suit ... he had tried to\r\ncover it up to Andy ... A lot of things about the smashed aircraft\r\nbothered him. Things like the flying suit; it had been made of strange\r\nmaterial; but hell, he'd burned that thing. There would be no problem\r\nwith that.\r\n\r\nAlmost without realizing it, he found himself staring at the car that\r\nwas parked on the other side of the street. The streetlight gleamed on\r\nthe black paint of the Chevrolet sedan and he thought of what Andy had\r\ntold him earlier about the men who had been interested in finding him.\r\nLooking at the car much closer, he could see the two men sitting in it.\r\nThe knot of fear returned to his stomach when he saw the light shining\r\non the driver's blond hair.\r\n\r\nThe men from Andy's gas station!\r\n\r\n\"Nick?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Beth. She had followed him down and he could see her framed in\r\nthe doorway at the foot of the stairs. She had slipped into a nightgown\r\nthat, in the moonlight, was more alluring than if she had been nude. She\r\nstarted to speak, but he hissed at her for silence.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Beth,\" he instructed, \"and don't put on a light.\"\r\n\r\nHer bare feet whispered on the rug as she came to his side in obvious\r\nbewilderment. He pointed out the car and the two men, telling her about\r\nhow they had inquired after him at the gas station. She listened\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\"What do they want?\" She asked, when he'd finished.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on the arm of the chair, leaning against him to study\r\nthe car. The soft pressure of her breasts was disturbing and conjured up\r\nmemories of early in the evening.\r\n\r\n\"What do they want?\" She asked again.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. That's something I have to find out. Listen, give me a\r\nminute to get to the upstairs window. Then snap on the light and move\r\naround. They're probably looking for me and I want to give them the\r\nimpression I'm not here.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Nick.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up and threaded his way to the stairs and up to kneel before the\r\nbedroom window that fronted on the street. Through the gap in the\r\ncurtains, he could see the car plainly. The light snapped on downstairs.\r\nFor a moment, nothing happened; the men merely sat in the car and\r\nwatched the house. Finally the car began moving down the street with its\r\nlights out. Then, out of range, the driver flicked on the lights and the\r\ncar disappeared. The downstairs light snapped off and a moment later\r\nBeth came into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Nick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they saw the crash...\" she began, but he cut her off short.\r\n\r\n\"No one saw me crash.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, later,\" she explained. \"After all, a wrecked car on a highway\r\nwould...\"\r\n\r\n\"Car? Beth, I didn't crack up in a car. I crashed on a wooded mountain\r\nin a private plane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, darling, don't be silly! You've never been in a plane in your\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the room, Nick could only stare in stunned amazement\r\nat the moonlit outline of his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nDetective Lieutenant Nolan Brice stood in the brush near the wrecked\r\naircraft, watching the men move about in the light of several spotlights\r\nthat had been set up by the National Guardsmen who had roped off the\r\narea. The thick blackness of the surrounding forest, plus a glance at\r\nhis watch, told him that dawn wasn't too far away. FAA investigator\r\nDickson, a thin, stringy ex-pilot stepped around the scrambled bits of\r\nwreckage and offered a light to the dead cigarette in Nolan's mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" Brice said and blew the smoke to the night. \"What d'you make\r\nof it, Mister Dickson?\"\r\n\r\nDickson shrugged and pushed his snap-brim hat back with a blunt\r\nforefinger. \"Dunno. It's pretty dark to see much, but it's no private\r\nplane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No wings, no tail assembly. Of course, it's hard to tell in the dark.\r\nWhen it gets light enough, we'll know the story; but I don't know of any\r\nprivate plane that looks like that one. Then too, the Army is holding\r\nthe news boys at bay. I think those two government fellows are playing\r\nthis one close to their chests.\"\r\n\r\nBrice nodded and dragged on the cigarette, but he said nothing about the\r\nspeed of the thing. \"Any bodies?\"\r\n\r\nDickson shook his head. \"The thing is pretty well burned, and the\r\nbodies, if there are any to be found, could be all over the area. We did\r\nfind a kind of flying suit, though, badly burned and torn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the suit? No one in it?\"\r\n\r\nDickson looked perplexed. \"Bothers you huh? Me too. I can't figure out\r\nwhy a pilot would carry something like that as an extra. Oh, well, it'll\r\nall come out when we really start investigating.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long does a thing like that take?\"\r\n\r\nDickson shrugged. \"A couple of days, a week. Even a few months. It's\r\nhard to say.\"\r\n\r\nBrice nodded, took a final drag on the cigarette and tossed it toward\r\nthe wreck, watching the red ash burst near the wreck. Dickson had\r\nwandered off to the far side of the crash-made clearing. Hell, Brice\r\nthought, I'd better get that butt. Leaving a thing like that around here\r\ncould get me in trouble. They'd think it was part of the crash.\r\n\r\nWhen he walked over to retrieve the butt, he saw the light from the\r\nflood glinting on a small gold object. He picked it up and found that he\r\nhad someone's watch. The crystal had been smashed, likely in the crash,\r\nand the hands were stopped at 4:15. The expansion band watch dispelled\r\nhis hunch that the pilot of the plane had been a Russian, or something;\r\nit was a Bulova, and he didn't think Russians had them. But what cinched\r\nthe whole thing was on the under side of the face, in the light of the\r\nspots, he could read: \"To Nick, Love, Beth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, it was there! He knew the watch. He knew it as well as he\r\nknew his own. Hell, he had picked it up at the jeweler's shop in\r\nEverett, two years before, when Beth hadn't been able to get into town\r\nand wanted to surprise Nick with it! Stunned and puzzled, Brice dropped\r\nthe watch into his pocket and decided not to say anything to Cartwell\r\nand Morgan. Maybe it would cost him, later, but he couldn't tell them -\r\nnot until he had a better picture of what the hell was going on.\r\n\r\nHe lit another cigarette and stood there thinking about the watch. How\r\nhad it gotten here? Nick didn't know how to fly a plane, and even if he\r\nhad studied the art, could he fly an aircraft that cleared a speed of\r\ntwo thousand miles per hour? Hell no! Nor had the watch been there, in\r\nthe weather, all this time.\r\n\r\nOf course, Nick could have hocked the damned thing in some town when he\r\nneeded money, and by some quirk of fate it had been brought back to the\r\nsame area it had left over a year before. That was possible, but Brice\r\ndidn't believe it. It just didn't fit.\r\n\r\n\"Seen enough?\"\r\n\r\nBrice turned and saw Cartwell standing behind him. How long has he been\r\nthere, he wondered, and forced a grin. The stocky built blond grinned\r\nback at him.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you might want a cup of coffee,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Where the hell will you get coffee out here?\"\r\n\r\nCartwell waved an arm toward the foot of the hills. \"A farm down there.\r\nThey wake up early around here. Sam conned the farmer's wife into making\r\ncoffee for the boys. Want some?\"\r\n\r\n\"Might as well. We have a few minutes - in fact, we have a lot of time,\r\nbefore daylight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Getting tired?\" Cartwell asked, as they started down the hill past the\r\nring of soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"A little. More like anxious to find out what the tale is on that\r\nwreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've been talking to Dickson, I see.\"\r\n\r\nBrice nodded. \"Yeah. Well, one thing we know. It's apparently some kind\r\nof experimental aircraft ... like a rocket, or something. And, if it\r\nisn't one of ours...\" Brice left it hang and Cartwell didn't pick it up.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes they walked in silence through the dew splattered\r\nforests, homing in on the glow of yellow lights that winked at them\r\nthrough the branches. Finally they reached the rutted, dirt road that\r\ntwisted along the stream bed toward the framed shape of the farm house.\r\nCartwell broke the silence as they neared the place.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk much about the wreck around these people, Nolan. They're\r\nnice folks, but simple natured. They plant by the phases of the moon and\r\nthe biggest event in their lives is going to the state fair. They're\r\nLancaster Dutch, recently imported, and they believe in the hex signs\r\nthey painted on the barn.\"\r\n\r\nBrice nodded. \"Okay, John.\"\r\n\r\nThe farm couple were strangers to Brice, but their type was familiar.\r\nPennsylvania was full of them. They were, as Cartwell had said, good\r\npeople. They were farmers, about three jumps above the witchcraft\r\nbelieving stock that had given them birth and were hard to understand.\r\nThey were the stay-at-home type, to whom Pittsburgh was the Far West,\r\nand if they were forced to move farther than fifty miles away from home,\r\ntheir relations screamed that they would never see them again.\r\n\r\nThe woman, whose name Nolan hadn't caught, was plain appearing, with no\r\nmakeup and her hair pulled back into a severe knot at the base of her\r\nskull. From the moment, she asked them in and poured their coffee, he\r\nliked her. In her own, slow way she was a fine person, but her world\r\nwas the farm, her life was the soil.\r\n\r\n\"Have you found that poor pilot, yet?\" She asked, setting the coffee\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am,\" Cartwell told her.\r\n\r\nThe heavy set woman made a clucking sound with her mouth. \"Honest to\r\ntrue,\" she mused. \"You'd wonder why a thing like that had to come to\r\nbe.\" She sighed heavily. \"There'll be some poor woman in tears tonight.\r\nD'you think he was married?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, ma'am,\" Cartwell said.\r\n\r\n\"It's the children that suffer...\" she said softly and allowed the rest\r\nof what she was about to say trail off as Dickson came in. He smiled at\r\nthe farmwife and she poured him a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nDickson pulled off his hat. \"I'd like to thank you,\" he told her, \"for\r\nbeing so kind...\"\r\n\r\nThe woman looked pleased and flustered at the same time; there was a\r\ntinge of flush about her face. \"Bosh,\" she said, smiling. \"It's the\r\nleast a body can do. I know I'd feel real glad to have someone helping,\r\nwere it my boy up there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your boy flies?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did.\" The woman looked a bit pained. \"He was killed during the war.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Dickson said, and reached for a doughnut from the plate on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nA silence fell over them as they waited for the coming of dawn and a\r\nchance to really look the wreck over. Nolan was somehow glad to be\r\nspared of conversation with the others. He felt like a criminal, with\r\nthe small gold watch in his coat pocket and he wanted to tell Dickson\r\nand Cartwell about the thing. But he couldn't. For the first time in his\r\nlife he was delaying an investigation, hiding evidence. He was well\r\naware of the whole thing, but he was also aware of what the presence of\r\nthat watch meant. It was a personal thing now, and until he knew which\r\nway to go, he had to keep the watch a secret.\r\n\r\nIf Nick Danson had somehow come back in that wreck and, if they found no\r\nbodies, he would have gone to Beth ... the whole thing would be\r\ncomplicated beyond belief. What would such a thing do? What would happen\r\nto the woman he loved, if Nick Danson was back?\r\n\r\nHe stared moodily into the dark liquid in his coffee cup and wondered\r\nwhere it would all end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n\r\nNick awoke to sunlight streaming into his face and had a momentary\r\nimpression that it was dawn; then he realized that the sunlight had a\r\nreddish cast to it. He blinked at the bedroom clock, amazed to find that\r\nhe had slept until late afternoon.\r\n\r\nMy God, he thought groggily.\r\n\r\nHis headache was nearly gone, he noticed as he threw off the covers and\r\nswung his long legs to the floor. The soreness was still there, thumping\r\ndully in his stiff muscles, but sleep had been deep and brought no fresh\r\nnightmares to worry about. He cleaned himself up in the bathroom and got\r\na pair of slacks and a shirt from the closet, still feeling somewhat\r\nlike a stranger. While he dressed himself, he thought of the woman he\r\nwas married to.\r\n\r\nDespite the feeling of being a stranger in a strange world, and of being\r\ncaught up in a strange set of circumstances, he found himself feeling\r\ndelightful tremors when he thought of Beth. Even now, there was a tight,\r\nfluttering sensation in his insides when he thought of the talcumed\r\nsatin of her skin, the warm lift of her brightly nippled breasts and the\r\nstrong response of her rounded thighs. She was a beautiful woman. She\r\nwas sex all rolled up in a frame of gentle curves and soft flesh, and he\r\ncould see that to love a woman like her would not only be easy, it would\r\nbe a privilege.\r\n\r\nHe buckled the belt about his waist, trying to dispel the thoughts of\r\nthe woman, and went downstairs to the kitchen. Hunger gnawed at him\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\nThe coffee was cold. He turned the gas on under it and the note on the\r\ntable caught his eye. He picked it up to scan it briefly.\r\n\r\n  DARLING,\r\n\r\n    HAD TO RUSH OFF TO WORK. KISSED YOU GOOD-BY AND YOU SAID \"GLUMPTH\".\r\n    BE HOME SOON. LOVE YOU TERRIBLY.\r\n\r\n      BETH\r\n\r\nHe grinned at the note, balled it into his fist and threw it into the\r\npaper can. When the coffee was hot, he poured himself a cup and fixed a\r\ncouple of sandwiches with what was left of the package of cold meat. As\r\nhe was finishing the last couple of bites of the sandwich, he heard the\r\nthud of the evening paper against the front door. For a moment, it\r\nstartled him, then, when he had realized what it was, he was half out of\r\nthe chair... He paused there momentarily, then sank back into his seat.\r\nHe _couldn't_ go out there and get the paper - if the neighbors saw him\r\npicking it up ... He sat there, waiting for Beth to come home, the\r\nsuspense digging into his guts with ragged teeth. Had they found the\r\nplane? Were they onto him? Who were those two men? How did they know\r\nwhere to find him? Why were they looking for him?\r\n\r\nHe drank damned near the whole pot of coffee and watched the hands of\r\nthe electric clock move with agonizing slowness. Finally, at five forty,\r\nBeth drove up to the house and came through the door. Nick leaped from\r\nthe chair.\r\n\r\n\"The paper!\" He snatched it from her hands and began tearing it open.\r\nDamn newsboys for folding them!\r\n\r\n\"Nick! Aren't you going to kiss me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh? Oh.\" He kissed her briefly, fleetingly, and returned to the paper.\r\nThe crash was on page one.\r\n\r\n    WRECKAGE OF PRIVATE AIRCRAFT FOUND\r\n\r\n    Everett, Pa. The smouldering wreckage of what was apparently a\r\n    private plane was found late yesterday evening in the heavily wooded\r\n    area north of the city by a young Boy Scout looking for a campsite.\r\n\r\n    Benjamin Talbot, aged 13, after locating the mangled aircraft,\r\n    promptly called local police who dispatched Detective Lieutenant\r\n    Nolan Brice, Everett Rescue Squad and FAA investigator Arron P.\r\n    Dickson to examine the wreckage.\r\n\r\n    \"It's the most unusual crash site I've ever seen,\" FAA investigator\r\n    Dickson told local newsmen. \"There's no evidence of wings or tail\r\n    assembly. The fuselage is also of a strange design.\"\r\n\r\n    Detective Lieutenant Brice, after checking with the airport tower at\r\n    Everett, and with CAP officials, informed newsmen that no private\r\n    aircraft had been reported in trouble, or even over the particular\r\n    area in which the craft was found. \"Of course,\" Lieutenant Brice\r\n    added, \"one plane may have gone unnoticed. This is highly unlikely,\r\n    but we cannot overlook the possibility. What is puzzling, to me, is\r\n    that the aircraft has not been identified and there have been no\r\n    bodies found.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The Civil Air Patrol,\" Mr. Dickson commented, \"has been most\r\n    cooperative and are now engaged in an air search of the area, while\r\n    rescue squads work in the mountains.\"\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dickson went on to state that the mystery crash will be\r\n    thoroughly investigated by authorities in an effort to determine the\r\n    make and model of the plane, as well as the fate of its occupants.\r\n\r\n    At present, the crash site has been roped off and placed under guard\r\n    by local Militiamen. Only authorized personnel will be allowed to\r\n    view the wreckage. Major Gilbert Donnoue, of the Air Force\r\n    Experimental Wing, refused to make a statement as to whether the\r\n    plane was of Air Force origin. \"To my knowledge, we have lost no\r\n    test planes. However, an extensive check will undoubtedly be run to\r\n    verify this.\"\r\n\r\nTest plane? Nick stared in amazement at the words that leaped at him\r\nfrom the printed page. Test plane? What the hell was going on in this\r\nscrewy world? No wings? No tail assembly? No Mayday calls? No record of\r\nthe plane? The whole damned thing sounded ridiculous. Coupled with the\r\nfact that he had been out of touch for thirteen months, it all became\r\nweird.\r\n\r\nAnd to top it all off, Nolan Brice was one of the men who had been\r\nplaced on the investigating staff at the crash scene. Suppose he, Nick,\r\nhad left something at the scene ... a fraternity pin, a slip of paper\r\n... anything that would link the crash to the fact that he was alive and\r\nin Everett. The whole damned bunch would be on his tail, before you\r\ncould say, \"Jack Robinson.\" He...\r\n\r\n\"Nick,\" Beth pouted. \"Will you pay a little attention to me for a\r\nchange?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, honey, but it's the plane.\" While she listened he read the\r\naccount aloud and, when he'd finished, they exchanged glances. \"That's\r\nthe plane I was in,\" he told her.\r\n\r\n\"But you don't know how to fly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must know, unless someone else flew it. That's the plane I woke up\r\nbeside. I must have been in the damned thing. But I don't know if anyone\r\nelse was.\" He buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Nick. Should we call the police?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\nAlarmed at his violent outburst, she put her hand on his shoulder to\r\ncomfort him. \"All right dear. I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'd been different, if those men weren't after me. I'd call the police\r\nif they weren't dogging my tracks. I'd turn myself in just to find out\r\nwhat the hell's going on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me too,\" she said softly.\r\n\r\nAt first he didn't catch the meaning behind her words, then he blinked.\r\n\"What?\" He asked.\r\n\r\n\"The car, the black one. It followed me to work this morning.\" She\r\npaused, then added, \"It didn't follow me home though.\"\r\n\r\nNick slammed the paper to the floor, his lean jaw muscles knotted in\r\nanger. \"That settles it,\" he snapped. \"I can face whatever I'm mixed up\r\nin, but there's no earthly reason why you should be subjected to it!\r\nI'll have to get out!\"\r\n\r\nBeth threw herself into his arms, the ever ready tears welling in her\r\neyes. \"No, Nick,\" she pleaded. \"Whatever it is, we'll fight it. We'll\r\nmake out, but darling, don't leave me again!\"\r\n\r\nHe held her tightly against him, his hands stroking the warm softness of\r\nher back and spine. The perfume of her hair filled him with a heady\r\nthought of summer fields of flowers, of sweetness and tenderness, of ...\r\nlove. Love. Nick Danson, he told himself, you _are_ mixed up. You're\r\nfalling in love with your own wife.\r\n\r\n\"... and we'll go away,\" Beth was whispering in his ear. \"We'll pack\r\neverything and go far away, where we'll never see these men again. Nick.\r\nPlease. Oh, please keep me with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going away won't settle anything, sweetheart. They'll always be there,\r\njust outside the door. I've got to do something...\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off suddenly and it flicked into his mind like a film of the\r\npast, like a memory. The soft face of the girl, her hair a golden color\r\nagainst the backdrop of the ochre mountains ... the softness of the pale\r\nblue-green tree... She spun away from him, the loose, filmy blue dress\r\nwhirling about her trim ankles ... then she was coming back to him, arms\r\noutstretched ... kissing him lovingly...\r\n\r\nHe shut it off, clamped it from his mind. A memory! A memory that made\r\nno sense at all. A tremor of fear ran along his spine and trembled in\r\nhis flesh. What did it mean? What was happening to him?\r\n\r\n\"Nick?\" It was Beth. \"What is it, Nick? You look pale and frightened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. We'll go away.\"\r\n\r\nShe beamed. \"I know just the place. The cabin. Far up in the mountains.\r\nNo one will know we're there. We'll learn to love each other again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have to work,\" he pointed out.\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"That's true, still _you_ could go up there and try to\r\npuzzle this all out. I can come up in the evenings, and on weekends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might be a good idea,\" he admitted, thinking that at least, he'd be\r\nsafe from prying eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Then it's settled. You go sit somewhere and I'll get things packed.\"\r\n\r\nShe whisked away, almost running up the stairs to pack some things for\r\nhim. He walked to the kitchen, without turning on a light, and poured\r\nhimself a glass of water. Outside, through the window, he could see the\r\ntwilight fading into evening, the heavy purple clouds of night sweeping\r\nsteadily across the sky. A star winked later and he knew it. Venus. He\r\nstood there in the darkness and picked out many of them as they\r\nflickered into being. Mars. Sirius, Vega and others. There were...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... She came into his arms and talk was insignificant and quite\r\nunnecessary. The soft, white arms wound about his neck, tugging fingers\r\npulled playfully at his hair and she smiled at him. His lips moved down\r\nagainst hers and they were lost in themselves. He could feel the taut\r\npressure of her breasts playing against his chest and the firm roundness\r\nof her thighs working against his.\r\n\r\nHer strong fingers worked against the muscles of his shoulders, pulling\r\nhim down onto the cottony moss beneath the strange tree. The small\r\nlitheness of her body molded into his and his hands stroked her breasts\r\nbeneath the filmy cloth that covered them. Her hands moved upward to the\r\nstraps that swept over her shoulders and pulled them down. His eager\r\nfingers helped her, working the straps down until the firm mounds of her\r\nbreasts lifted their rubbery, coral tipped nipples toward the sky. His\r\nfingers worked them, kneaded the warm muscles, while his mouth worked on\r\nhers. When he had released her lips, she pulled his face down into the\r\ntwin cushions of her breasts. His hand moved against the flesh of her\r\nthighs, caressingly...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Ready, dear?\"\r\n\r\nIt was gone. Like that. A sudden flickering memory of some long vanished\r\nevent that might have given him some hope. It had been fantastic again,\r\nthe strange colors and the weird landscape, but he wanted it despite\r\nthat. She had stolen it, ripped it viciously from his mind; but she was\r\nnot to blame. He turned and smiled at her as she came into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nShe had turned on a soft light in the front room, but had allowed the\r\nkitchen to remain dark. In the half-light of the room, he thought that\r\nshe was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. It would not be hard\r\nto love her, he thought again.\r\n\r\nHe reached out and took her by the shoulders, pulling her gently against\r\nhim to kiss her. Her mouth moved against his, satiny with desire, until\r\nthey parted.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready, if you are,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"For what, darling? The bedroom, or the car?\"\r\n\r\nHe chuckled. \"The car. The bedroom will keep until we're up in the\r\nwoods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the glow of the headlights, the car swallowed the road voraciously\r\nand they moved toward the north country - not, he noticed, on route 87.\r\nThey had not been seen leaving the city, nor had they been seen packing\r\nthe car. The garage had a door that led into the kitchen, and Nick had\r\nlaid on the back seat floorboards until they were in the country. Now,\r\nsitting in the front seat, he wondered vaguely if Beth, in her joy at\r\nhaving him home, had given herself away to her friends. He hoped not. He\r\nglanced sidewise at her and noticed that she drove with a smile on her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Is it far to the cabin?\" He asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not now. We're almost to the turn off.\"\r\n\r\nHe lapsed again into silence, the old questions still whirling about in\r\nhis mind. Who were the men who were after him? What did they want? How\r\nmuch had the FAA learned of the plane? Had they found something to pin\r\nit on him? What were these tiny, fleeting thoughts that cropped up in\r\nhis mind? Was his mind trying to tell him something via the nightmares?\r\nAnd what of his best friend, Nolan Brice. Where has he been? What is he\r\nup to? It struck Nick as odd that he had not encountered the detective\r\nyet: surely he and Beth had been close the past year. How close? Suppose\r\nBrice stumbled upon Andy Hocum. Would the old man talk?\r\n\r\nFeeling more helpless than he had ever felt in his life, at least the\r\nlife he remembered, Nick stared at the road until Beth turned off on\r\nanother road that was little more than a wagon track beside a small\r\ncreek. A few minutes of bouncing over ruts and stones, and she turned\r\noff again, parking beside a grey, frame cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are, darling.\"\r\n\r\nThey got out, each taking a box from the back seat, and Nick followed\r\nher up the stairs to the porch. Beth set her box down and found the key.\r\nA moment later the lock clicked and she shoved the door open.\r\n\r\n\"Wait'll I find the light, Nick,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nA moment later, the light snapped on and a soft glow filled the front\r\nroom of the cabin. They took the boxes to the kitchen and set them on\r\nthe table, then went back into the front room. Nick studied the place.\r\n\r\nHe liked the room a lot; there was a rugged manliness in the stone\r\nfireplace and the knotty pine walls, mingled with just a touch of Beth's\r\nfemininity to make it neat. All in all, it was a well laid out place. He\r\nwas attracted to the oil paintings that hung about the walls.\r\n\r\n\"Like it?\" Beth asked.\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"But it doesn't bring back any memories?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Hell, honey, I can't even remember what I did for a living.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled sadly. \"Want to see?\"\r\n\r\nWhen he nodded, she motioned him to the other side of the front room and\r\nopened the door. She flicked on the light and he stepped into a small\r\nstudy filled with the trappings of an artist. Tubes of paint lay on\r\nsmall tables, beside cans of turpentine, lacquer and old paint rags. A\r\nhalf finished nude adorned one of the heavy easels. There were a few\r\nwater color sketches laying around as well as several oils.\r\n\r\n\"Want to see some of your favorite models?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded numbly, and she drew open a drawer in the table and pulled out\r\nfour fairly large oil paintings done on commercial painting boards.\r\n\r\nThe first two were of Beth, one a nude and the other a semi-nude, with\r\nonly her lovely breasts exposed. The second two paintings were of a girl\r\nwho was not familiar at all. In the first picture, a portrait, she was\r\nseated before a table, contemplating a vase of flowers. A rather good\r\nlooking girl with jet black hair and a soft, warm looking face. The next\r\npainting was of the same girl, but this time she had been painted as a\r\nHawaiian dancer and her skin was a trifle darker. She was a pretty girl,\r\nbut her face and nicely formed body didn't ring a bell.\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\" He asked.\r\n\r\n\"Her name is Janet Holman. She lives about four or five miles from here,\r\non her father's farm.\" Beth nodded toward the green filing cabinet in\r\nthe corner. \"You have her file over there with your records. Doesn't any\r\nof this ring a bell, darling?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him sadly, her face mirroring the way she felt. \"I hope\r\nit'll come back, darling.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached out and pulled her to him, holding her tight. \"It'll come\r\nback,\" he whispered. \"C'mon. I want to build a fire in that fireplace.\r\nIt's cool in here, even if it is summer.\"\r\n\r\nThey went back out into the front room and, while Beth found some\r\nkindling, Nick wadded up some newspapers and stuffed them in the\r\nfireplace. When she brought it in, he lighted the stuff and after it was\r\ngoing good, he added a couple of logs. He snapped off the light and\r\ngrinned at her.\r\n\r\n\"I like firelight,\" he told her. \"It's restful.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled back at him. \"Restful? I think it's sexy.\" She had kicked off\r\nher pumps and was lying before the glow of the hearth on the thick rug.\r\nHe arranged the mesh screen before the fire and laid down beside her.\r\n\r\n\"Sexy, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh huh. I don't know, darling ... the warmth of the fire warms me up, I\r\nguess.\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned and dropped his head to the cushions of her breasts. Her\r\nfingers played in his hair.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad,\" he told her.\r\n\r\n\"You used to be. That used to be our favorite way of spending an\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laying in front of a fire?\" Nick asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not just _any_ fire, darling. This particular fire, sans clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like fun,\" he mused and rolled over to kiss the ripe redness of\r\nher lips. Her tongue stabbed a blade of passion at him and her arms\r\npulled him close; then, after a moment, she shoved him away and stood\r\nup.\r\n\r\nHe propped himself on one elbow and looked at her. Her smile was impish\r\nas she unfastened the buttons of the white blouse and pulled it from the\r\nwaistband of the navy blue skirt. Her fingers unhooked the snaps of the\r\nbra and dropped it to the floor beside the blouse. The firelight was\r\ngolden against the swelling lift of her breasts and the flat expanse of\r\nher stomach. Nick felt the thundering beginning again to slam through\r\nhis veins with the holocaust of a napalm bomb exploding against the\r\nground as she unzipped the skirt and dropped it into a puddle on the\r\nthick rug. He watched in pounding fascination as she stepped daintily\r\nfrom the whorl of the skirt, clad only in the pinkish transparency of\r\nher panties. Then they too were a thing of the past, and Beth was\r\nsmiling down at him, passion spearing from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Will I still do?\" She asked.\r\n\r\n\"Do what?\" He croaked.\r\n\r\n\"You know?\" She laughed at him, kneeling on the rug. \"Will I still do as\r\na model?\"\r\n\r\nHe laid down flat and chuckled. \"A model, sweetheart, is a small\r\nimitation of the real thing. You don't look imitation to me.\" He reached\r\nup and grabbed her arm to pull her down with him onto the rug, but she\r\njerked away.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, you don't. You have to undress too.\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned at her and peeled off his clothes quickly. She came into his\r\narms then and they made love, letting the glowing warmth of the fire\r\ncaress them hotly. His hands smoothed her breasts while his mouth worked\r\nat the fire that was coming to life throughout her body.\r\n\r\n\"Just like old times?\" He asked, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Better, darling ... much better.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nSometime near midnight, Beth took the car and went home. Nick poured a\r\ncup of the coffee she had made for him and went back into the study to\r\nlook at the paintings a second time. It was good, professional work, and\r\nhe wondered if he could do the same stuff again. Hell, he decided, it'll\r\nbe a long time until I get back at an easel. He finished the coffee and\r\nwent up to bed.\r\n\r\nIt took awhile to get to sleep. Thoughts of the wrecked plane, Beth, the\r\nstrange men and Nolan Brice kept running around in his head without\r\nfinding answers to the enigmas they presented to him. Finally he slept.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was looking at himself, in the dream, but it was not in a mirror. He\r\nwas standing inside a polished room and the other Nick Danson lay on a\r\nbed wrapped in sleep. Nick blinked at the still duplicate of himself on\r\nthe bed and turned away to look at the room he was in. It wasn't large.\r\nIt appeared to be some kind of bedroom, and it was well lighted although\r\nthere were no lights to be seen; the walls seemed to glow, and\r\neverything was of a bright metal. The mirror caught his eye and he saw\r\nhimself in the same blue and yellow uniform that he'd worn before. The\r\nDanson who lay asleep on the bed was dressed in blue dress pants and a\r\nwhite shirt. The tie had been loosened at his throat and his clothing\r\nwas wrinkled badly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the other Danson opened his eyes and looked at Nick. For a\r\nmoment he appeared to be startled at seeing him, then he smiled. The\r\nsmile erupted in a chuckle that became a laugh. The other Danson's face\r\ngrew large and full, roaring out laughter at Nick until the whole scene\r\nchanged from one of odd curiosity to one of absolute horror, the kind of\r\nweird horror that can come only from peals of loud, echoing laughter\r\nrolling through the caverns of the mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNick awoke gasping, his fingers knotted in the sheets of the bed and a\r\ncold sweat beading out upon his face. His heart hammered in his chest\r\nlike a drum, threatening to leap to his throat at any moment. He looked\r\naround anxiously for Beth, but the silence of the room reminded him that\r\nshe had gone back to the city and her job. Dawn was breaking and the dim\r\nlight filtered through the unwashed windows. There was little point in\r\ntrying to sleep now. Might as well get his clothes on and try to start\r\nunraveling a long thread of odd events.\r\n\r\nHe pulled on his clothes slowly and slid his feet into his shoes,\r\nwondering where to begin the climb back to himself. It would be bad\r\nenough for an amnesia victim to regain all his memory if given an\r\nunlimited length of time - this way, with people closing in on all\r\nsides, the whole damned thing seemed impossible.\r\n\r\nHe hooked the last button on his shirt, stuffed it into his pants, and\r\nheaded for the kitchen. He warmed up last night's coffee and it tasted\r\nlike warm sulfuric acid, but it brought him around to full\r\nconsciousness, even if his stomach did object to it.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished the coffee, he found the library in the den and\r\nbegan reading a few of the titles; often, he remembered, a lot could be\r\ntold from a man by his reading habits. There were books by Bridgeman,\r\nZaindenburg and Loomis, almost everything on the shelves pertained to\r\nart in some form or another - except for the last row. There were about\r\nfifteen science fiction volumes, mostly collections of short stories,\r\nfrom Asimov to A.E. van Vogt. He had a fleeting idea to start reading\r\nthe stuff in an effort to determine whether or not his strange dreams\r\ncame from somewhere within the pages, then he rejected it. It would take\r\na hell of a long while to even skim through that mass of literature and\r\nhe didn't have the time.\r\n\r\nHe shoved a copy of H. Beam Piper back onto the shelf and straightened.\r\nTo hell with it. He had the whole house to search, before he started\r\nfumbling through something as far out as science fiction. He started\r\nrummaging through the various rooms of the place with systematic\r\ncarefulness. Hoping...\r\n\r\nWhen he finished the search, it was noon. He knew a lot about the cabin,\r\nbut damned little about himself. The cramped, dismal attic contained\r\nwhat was left of pictures, odd bits of furniture and clothes after the\r\nlocal field mice and porcupines had their annual convention up there.\r\nThe three bedrooms revealed nothing except the usual gear to be found in\r\nany bedroom, and of the downstairs section of the place, only the art\r\nstudio and the combination den-library was of interest. And even these\r\nplaces shed no light upon the ghost of the man that haunted him. The\r\nstudio contained all of the trappings of an artist, even though it was\r\nin rather battered up shape, and the den was a wall to wall replica of\r\nwhat a woodsman might have owned. There were the books, the stuffed\r\nheads and, of course, the guns.\r\n\r\nThe rack, on the far side of the room, contained a table with bullet\r\nloading equipment scattered around it, with cans of DuPont powder on the\r\nfloor. Above it, in the gun rack were the weapons - enough to hold off a\r\nsmall revolution. There were two handguns and three rifles and a\r\nshotgun. He looked them over.\r\n\r\nA Smith and Wesson .38, model 36 and a Ruger Blackhawk .44 Magnum that\r\nlooked like the old peacemaker model. One of the rifles was a Marlin\r\nsaddle carbine, model 336 and the other was a Winchester African rifle\r\nwith a .458 bore. The last gun on the rack was a Stevens .410 single\r\nbarrel shotgun. Nick grinned at the arsenal and took the .44 magnum down\r\nfrom the rack to clean it. It wasn't in too bad of shape, even for as\r\nlong as it had remained idle; even the western style holster and gunbelt\r\ncontained enough oil to make them pliable.\r\n\r\nHe slipped the magnum into the holster and buckled the gunbelt about his\r\nwaist, letting it hang a little on the right side. To hell with it, he\r\nthought. If those two characters show up now, at least I'll have an\r\nedge. He pulled five .44 Special slugs from the belt and loaded the\r\nweapon, being careful to see that the hammer hung on the empty chamber.\r\nThen he decided to see how good he was.\r\n\r\nWhere the hill rose sharply for a small distance behind the house, Nick\r\nfound a good area where he could test his marksmanship. He lined up five\r\ncans, a few feet apart, at the base of the rise and snapped off five\r\nfast shots at them as quick as the single action would operate. Either\r\namnesia had nothing to do with a man's gun knowledge, or he was a\r\nnatural. All five cans were blown to hell and sent skittering against\r\nthe side of the hill. Stunned, but satisfied, he reloaded the revolver\r\nand dropped it back into the holster.\r\n\r\nHe prowled the grounds about the cabin with the aimlessness of a man\r\nlooking for something but not sure what. Beyond the lawn furniture and\r\nthe shed that contained his tools, the only other interesting thing was\r\nthe creek. A fast running little stream, barely a foot deep but filled\r\nwith numerous little holes that bragged of trout. He walked along the\r\ngurgling water for a ways, then he went back to the house, still unsure\r\nof what to do.\r\n\r\nHe went back to the cabin and shoved the door open and stopped dead!\r\n\r\nShe was just like the painting. Her raven black hair hung loose and free\r\nwhile, beneath the scant confines of the shorts and halter, the warm\r\nflesh rose and fell temptingly. Nick stood there, unable to say a word.\r\nIt was Janet and the light in her eyes made him wonder what kind of a\r\nguy he'd been more than ever. She gave a little gasp of pure pleasure\r\nand flung herself into his arms, planting the ripe sweetness of her lips\r\nsquarely on his.\r\n\r\n\"Janet,\" he managed, but she had a strangle hold on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Russian?\" Brice asked, looking at Sam Morgan.\r\n\r\nThe dark complected Fed pulled the mangled cigar from his mouth and\r\npointed it toward the twisted wreckage. On the far side, Cartwell and\r\nDickson were looking it over.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Morgan asked.\r\n\r\n\"It seems outlandish, somehow.\"\r\n\r\nMorgan grinned, his peg-like teeth flashing. \"You small town cops are\r\ngood. I won't take that from you. But you look at everything from a\r\nlocal viewpoint. In our business, you broaden, you might say.\r\n\r\n\"Look at the facts, Nolan. The Defense boys spotted the thing up north.\r\nRadar locked on it and gave it a speed of over two thousand miles per.\r\nSo it crashes and we find no wings, no tail assembly ... and I have the\r\nhunch that the damned thing ran on nuclear power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Atomic?\" Nolan whispered, amazed. While the Federal cop talked about\r\nnuclear power and fantastic speeds, all Brice could think of was the\r\nwatch he'd found at the scene. How the hell could an artist learn to\r\npilot a thing like that in a mere thirteen months, and what the hell was\r\nbehind it all. \"You mean, atomic power?\"\r\n\r\nMorgan nodded. \"See that funnel shaped gismo over there, with the round\r\nball-like affair?\" He was pointing to what was probably the tail of the\r\nship, at least it was not the section that had absorbed the smash into\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nNolan nodded.\r\n\r\n\"That's a nuclear reactor,\" Sam went on. \"Uncle Sam doesn't have\r\nanything in the air with that kind of power. I think we're testing a few\r\nengines, but nothing flying yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is Russian?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my guess. No other country would build it. Oh, Great Britain\r\ncould, but if it was one of theirs, they would have plastered the red\r\nand blue targets on it. Offhand, it looks to me like a glorified version\r\nof the old U-2 thing, only on their side.\"\r\n\r\nBrice didn't answer. He stared at the wreckage as though it were some\r\nsort of demon, while a million thoughts burst in his brain. Nick Danson\r\nwas in this? He flew it? Where did he get it? How did he get it? Was it\r\nRussian? Was Nick a Russian spy?\r\n\r\nHe tried to cover the amazement on his face by lighting a cigarette.\r\n\"How come it didn't develop into a pint sized Hiroshima, if it has\r\natomic power in it?\"\r\n\r\nMorgan grinned at him, as though he was a kid. \"I said it was powered by\r\natomic energy, not atomic bombs. There's a kind of difference in...\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Sam! C'mere!\"\r\n\r\nBoth of the men turned to look across the twisted mass of wreckage to\r\nwhere Cartwell and Dickson were standing. The blond Fed was holding up a\r\npiece of the wreckage and his face glowed with excitement that he didn't\r\ntry to cover.\r\n\r\n\"C'mon, Nolan,\" Sam grinned. \"Let's go see what my buddy dug up ... I'll\r\nbet its a Russian manufacturer's trade mark.\"\r\n\r\nThey skirted the wreck and trotted up to where Cartwell stood with the\r\npiece of metal. \"Russian, huh?\" asked Sam.\r\n\r\n\"Russian, hell,\" Cartwell snorted. \"It looks like a cross between\r\nChinese and Arabic.\"\r\n\r\nSam took the piece and looked at it, the cigar clamped belligerently in\r\nhis jaws. After a tense moment, he grunted noncommittally and passed the\r\nthing to Nolan Brice.\r\n\r\nHe knew nothing of Russian, Chinese or Arabic, but he knew what Chinese\r\ncharacters looked like. The imprinted marks on the metal bore a certain\r\nresemblance to the Chinese language, but yet were not the same. It\r\nconsisted of strange marks that were like nothing Brice had ever seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"There are similar markings on the control panel,\" Dickson said into the\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"Crap,\" Sam Morgan snorted. \"I say Russian. How about you, partner?\"\r\n\r\nCartwell furled his blond brows. \"I think I'd rather let an expert look\r\nthis piece over before I make any kind of guess as to where that wreck\r\nflew from.\" He turned to Nolan. \"Where can we find an expert, Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everett College would be the only place I know of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, we'll give them a try. Where's Lieutenant Peters?\"\r\n\r\nMorgan jerked a thumb over his shoulder toward the other side of the\r\nclearing. \"Over there,\" he said, \"dressing down one of his Weekend\r\nWarriors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sam. How about going over and remind him to keep any characters off the\r\nsite. I have a horror of having the news boys scoop us on this.\"\r\n\r\nSam nodded and took off to talk with the Army. Dickson looked at\r\nCartwell.\r\n\r\n\"Anything for me?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No. Just continue with your investigators. You can make the\r\narrangements about having this thing hauled down to Everett, but check\r\nwith me before you do. Okay?\"\r\n\r\nDickson nodded.\r\n\r\n\"C'mon, Brice,\" Cartwell said. \"Let's get Morgan and find out what the\r\ncollege professors can tell us about this screwy thing.\"\r\n\r\nThey wrapped the piece of metal in Cartwell's jacket and the three of\r\nthem headed through the forest toward the road in the valley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProfessor Nichols was a wisp of a man who peered at them through small,\r\nbright eyes nearly hidden in fleshy folds. Although his body was about\r\nthe shortest Brice had ever seen on a man, the brain beneath his crop of\r\nwhite hair had made him a giant. A linguist all his life, Professor\r\nNichols spoke a dozen languages fluently, in addition to reading and\r\nwriting them. Brice knew him by reputation and grinned at him as he came\r\ninto the empty Dean's office.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen?\" He favored them with a smile. \"I'm Nichols. Doctor Bendtolz\r\nsaid you wanted to speak with me.\"\r\n\r\nBrice introduced himself and the Federal men and, after a round of\r\nhandshaking, Cartwell handed the chunk of metal to the professor.\r\n\r\n\"We'd like to know about the writing, Professor,\" Sam put in.\r\n\r\nNichols examined the etching on the metal for some time before he looked\r\nup. His small eyes searched their faces in turn, then he smiled thinly\r\nas though witnessing a very bad gag.\r\n\r\n\"Are you gentlemen playing some sort of joke?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The Government doesn't pay us to play jokes,\" Cartwell informed him\r\ncryptically. \"Do you know the language?\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Nichols shook his head. \"I know every spoken language in the\r\nworld, and I know many of the dead languages at least by sight. I don't\r\nknow this one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're serious?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded. \"This must be some sort of jest on me. There is no\r\nlanguage on Earth, dead or alive, that matches this.\"\r\n\r\n\"We aren't joking, Professor,\" Nolan said seriously.\r\n\r\n\"Then, my friend, someone must be playing a joke on you. No linguist can\r\nidentify this language. I'll stake my reputation on that. Where did you\r\nget this?\"\r\n\r\nCartwell smiled. \"I'm sorry, professor, but we cannot disclose that\r\ninformation. We'll also have to ask you to forget about it. Government\r\nbusiness, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course. Is there anything else? I have a class in three\r\nminutes...\"\r\n\r\n\"No, that's all. Thank you, Professor Nichols.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're welcome. Good day, gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nAs the door closed behind him, a thick silence fell over the three men.\r\nCartwell looked out the window and pulled at his lower lip with a blunt\r\nthumb and forefinger; Nolan sat on the edge of a desk, looking at the\r\nstrange writing as an ethnologist might stare at the bones of the\r\nmissing link.\r\n\r\n\"What now?\" Sam asked, softly. \"Call in a Martian to get his opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not funny, Sam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't I know it,\" Sam shot back. \"We've got some kind of tiger by the\r\ntail in this case ... a tiger bigger than the Kremlin, and I'm wondering\r\nhow this will all sound in a report to the capital.\"\r\n\r\nCartwell snorted and ran a hand through his blond hair. \"I'll let you\r\nwrite the report, Sam.\"\r\n\r\n\"You go to hell. I like my job and I don't want to get booted out\r\nbecause of a science fiction twist on an otherwise normal\r\ninvestigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the next move?\" Nolan asked, trying to ignore the sinking\r\nfeeling in his stomach.\r\n\r\nCartwell shrugged. \"Go back to the wreck, I guess and try to figure out\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nSam suddenly slammed his fist on the table and several textbooks danced.\r\n\"John,\" he exploded. \"You _know_ what this means, don't you? If the\r\nprofessor's right, and this gibberish on this chunk of metal _isn't_ an\r\nEarth language, then we got problems! You know what we got up there? We\r\ngot a Flying Saucer! A space ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God, Sam cut it out! I don't believe in the damned things, I\r\nrefuse to.\"\r\n\r\nSam snickered. \"It looks to me as though you haven't any choice in the\r\nmatter. It's like refusing to believe in a Ford V-8; it don't make any\r\ndifference whether you believe it or not, it's there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus,\" Cartwell said softly.\r\n\r\n\"And that isn't the payoff. We didn't find a body in the wreckage.\r\nUnless that ship traveled by remote control, it had a pilot who is\r\nwandering around the country right now. I can see it now. A wounded\r\nlittle green man running around trying to hitch a ride back to Mars.\r\nIt'd be funny if it wasn't so damned serious.\"\r\n\r\nCartwell nodded at his partner. \"We'd better get back up there to the\r\nsite. Maybe the air search or the rescue squads picked something up.\r\nComing, Brice?\"\r\n\r\nNolan forced a grin. \"With little green men running around?\" Then he\r\nbecame serious. \"I'll be up a little later. I have something to do down\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nMorgan snorted as they headed for the door. \"See if you can locate a\r\nBuck Rogers ray gun. We might need it.\"\r\n\r\nThey went back to their cars and Nolan Brice wedged himself behind the\r\nwheel but he didn't start the engine. He sat there, instead, watching\r\nthe Government men drive off down the street, his mind whirling with a\r\nmillion jangling thoughts that tore through him viciously. Flying\r\nsaucers, Martians, little green men! The whole damned thing was\r\nimpossible, ridiculous...\r\n\r\nBut true. A man just couldn't sit down and say \"I refuse to believe in\r\nlightning.\" It didn't make sense. You had to believe what your mind told\r\nyou ... and his mind was telling him wild things.\r\n\r\nIt all fit. Hell, it fit with a perfection that was absolutely\r\nfantastic, but crazy enough to be the truth. Nick Danson, commercial\r\nartist, disappeared thirteen months ago and every police agency in the\r\ncountry can't locate him. It was as if the earth had opened and\r\nswallowed him; but it hadn't been the earth, it had been the sky. _They_\r\nhad done it ... the Martians, or whatever the hell they were.\r\n\r\nWhy? Why steal a Terran?\r\n\r\nTo replace him? To send an alien being down to take the place of the\r\nTerran they had stolen. That took care of the confusion the watch had\r\nrepresented. For awhile it had looked as though Nick had piloted that\r\nspace ship, but now Nolan knew better. It wasn't Nick. It was an alien!\r\n\r\nBeth!\r\n\r\nHad an alien, posing as Nick, located Beth and was now engaged in using\r\nher to help in whatever they had come here to do? How many other Missing\r\nPersons cases were wrapped up in this thing? How many aliens were\r\nwalking the streets of earth right now? To hell with that, Nolan, he\r\nroared at himself. The important thing is Beth. You've got to find out\r\nabout this thing and stop it, before something happens to her.\r\n\r\nHe started the car, slammed it into gear and gunned it out onto the\r\nstreet, the tires screaming a protest...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\n\r\nJanet was more than a beautiful woman and a good model. She was white\r\nheat and surging womanhood all dolled up in a body like that of a French\r\nmovie star. She was as wanton as a Polynesian dancer and as demanding as\r\na nympho. Lying there beside her relaxed nakedness, Nick Danson felt\r\nlike another man - a tired one.\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand over the swelling rise of her breast and slid it down\r\nthe flat velvet of her stomach. She made a small sound in her throat and\r\nkissed him on the cheek with lips like branding irons.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you have amnesia,\" she cooed against his ear.\r\n\r\n\"Why, for God's sake?\"\r\n\r\nShe snuggled the curling warmth of her body against him and chuckled.\r\n\"Because of this. You used to kiss me, but that was all. I wanted more,\r\nbut not you.\"\r\n\r\nHe blinked at the ceiling at her words. She'd tricked him! It was a nice\r\ntrick, but still she'd cheated. All the time he'd figured that she was\r\nsome sort of mistress, or something - obviously that's what _she_ had\r\nwanted, but in his other life he'd never given her a tumble. It was\r\nfunny, in a way.\r\n\r\n\"You mean ... we never...\"\r\n\r\n\"Nope.\" She chuckled again. \"Aren't I a rat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vixen, is more like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good word. I like it. Janet Vixen. How would you like to kiss\r\nJanet Vixen, Nick Danson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I get another knock on the head,\" he suggested, \"and I lose the\r\nmemory of all this, too? Then what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't embarrass you in front of company. C'mon, kiss me again,\r\nstranger!\"\r\n\r\nHe rolled over and kissed her again and, tired or not, he could feel the\r\ndesire surging through him again. Her small hands moved over the muscles\r\nof his shoulders, digging into his flesh, her teeth nibbling at his\r\nneck. Janet was one of those odd women who can't seem to take a darned\r\nthing serious. No matter what the risks were involved, to her making\r\nwild love was a hell of a lot of fun and that was that. He had the hunch\r\nthat if he tried to get serious with her - marriage serious - she'd\r\nbounce him fast. But hell, it was impossible to think of things like\r\nthat with her, besides he was having too much fun. If, he thought later,\r\nyou can call it fun when you're so weak you can't move.\r\n\r\n\"I have to go, lover,\" she said finally. \"Beth might come up, and I\r\nthink she would be apt to get a little put out if she caught us in bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's putting it mildly,\" he grinned. \"Besides, I have to start trying\r\nto find out about myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do me a favor and don't.\" She pecked him lightly on the lips. \"I like\r\nthe new Nick Danson a hell of a lot better. C'mon. Snap my bra.\"\r\n\r\nThey climbed out of bed and he helped her into her shorts and halter.\r\nShe kissed him lightly again, said; \"Good-by, lover,\" and bounced out\r\ninto the hall, leaving him standing there, naked in the bedroom.\r\n\r\nWhat a world, he thought for the hundredth time and began to gather his\r\nclothes. When he started to put his pants on, his wallet dropped from\r\nthe hip pocket and flopped open on the floor. He picked it up, his eyes\r\nabsently noticing the card that was exposed in the clear, plastic\r\nwindow. It was a Selective Service Registration Certificate and someone\r\nhad written \"small scar on right forearm\" under the column for general\r\nmarkings. Absently he glanced at his right forearm, then his eyes\r\nwidened in shock.\r\n\r\nThere was no scar!\r\n\r\nA man cannot lose a scar, he told himself. He checked the card again. It\r\nwas his, made out to Nicholas Howard Danson; but the scar was missing.\r\nHe searched his arm and it wasn't there. The full realization of the\r\nwhole thing struck him suddenly like a punch in the mouth. He was _not_\r\nNicholas Howard Danson!\r\n\r\nWho was he? What the hell was going on? Had he killed the real Danson\r\nbecause they were obviously look alikes, and stolen the guy's I.D. Why?\r\nWas he escaping from some kind of crime? Was he a criminal, and what did\r\nthe strange dreams have to do with it?\r\n\r\nNumbly he climbed into the rest of his clothes and made damned sure the\r\n.44 magnum was loaded when he strapped it on. His hands shook\r\nuncontrollably and he felt trapped. It would only be a matter of time\r\nbefore those people at the wreck figured out the whole story and came\r\nhowling after him. He had to get out.\r\n\r\nThe screech of car brakes startled him and he leaped to the window. A\r\npolice car was in the lane and a single, plainclothes cop was getting\r\nout. It could only be Nolan. He watched as Brice pulled his Police\r\nPositive from the speed rig and headed toward the house. Then Nick\r\nhauled out his magnum and slammed it into the window.\r\n\r\nBrice dived behind a bush as the magnum threw a .44 slug that barely\r\nmissed the cop. The .38 barked back and Nick ducked the splinters as the\r\nbullet chipped the window frame.\r\n\r\n\"Come out, you fool,\" Brice roared.\r\n\r\n\"You go to hell,\" Nick yelled and fired again. \"Who tipped you off,\r\nNolan? Beth?\"\r\n\r\n\"You left Danson's watch where your flying saucer cracked up!\" Brice\r\nsnapped another shot at the window.\r\n\r\nFlying saucer? Nick blinked. What the hell was that stupid cop talking\r\nabout?\r\n\r\n\"What'd you do with Nick,\" Brice roared.\r\n\r\nNick let the magnum answer for him, not trusting his voice. In the few\r\nseconds that followed Nick, in his nervous excitement, emptied the\r\nrevolver at Brice, but never even grazed him. He cursed and began\r\nthumbing cartridges into the Ruger. He was almost finished, when Nolan\r\ncaught onto the maneuver and decided to come in closer. He stood up and\r\nbegan sprinting toward the house. Nick had just yanked the hammer of the\r\ngun back to fire as Brice came into the open but he never made it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the middle of the yard, Detective Lieutenant Nolan Brice\r\ndisappeared into thin air! Nick heard him yell for help, but he could\r\nsee nothing. The yelling kept going straight up into the air until it\r\ngrew faint in the distance.\r\n\r\nNick stared dumbfoundedly at the area where the cop had suddenly faded\r\nout of sight. What the hell was going on in this screwy place? Then he\r\nheard the shout below him and he twisted to stare at the borders of the\r\nsmall creek. It was the two men from Andy Hocum's gas station - the\r\nblond giant and the sandy haired guy. Panicky, Nick snapped off a shot\r\nand the blond dived for cover.\r\n\r\n\"The dumb bastard is shooting,\" the blond yelled to his companion\r\nseveral yards away. \"Let's get the hell out of here, before he hits\r\nsomething!\"\r\n\r\nHe got a brief glimpse of them as they took off through the brush and\r\nsnapped a shot at them to hurry them along, just as Beth's car rocked up\r\nthe rutty road and braked beside the police car. She leaped out yelling\r\nfor him and he went down the stairs to meet her, the gun still in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHer face was drained of color as she came into the house, the red of her\r\nlips looking even more red against the pale wash of her face. \"Nick!\r\nWhere's Nolan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God, Nick! Have you killed him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't hit him,\" Nick told her. \"I emptied the magnum at him and he\r\ndisappeared into the air.\" His eyes had a wild look in them, \"Right into\r\nthe air,\" he added inanely. Everything was so balled up. Everything was\r\ncrazy. He wasn't Nick Danson ... he didn't know his name ... Brice\r\nvanished into thin air ... the two guys were dogging his tracks ...\r\nwomen came out of the woodwork to make love to him. What the hell else\r\ncould possibly happen?\r\n\r\nBeth was staring at him. \"You killed him,\" she breathed.\r\n\r\n\"No, no! He vanished. He vanished ... honest to God, I never even came\r\nclose to hitting him. I might as well have thrown rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men do not disappear into thin air,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, forget that for a minute. How'd he know I was here?\"\r\n\r\nShe sank wearily onto a chair and looked at him. \"He found the watch I\r\ngave you a few years ago. It was lying at the crash site. He came to the\r\noffice where I work and asked about you. I denied that I knew you were\r\nback and he began to yell at me about my life being in danger and that I\r\nshould stay away from you until he had a chance to put a bullet into\r\nyou. My God, Nick! What have you done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dunno,\" he lied. Should he tell her that he was not her husband, that\r\nhe didn't have the foggiest notion of who he was? He decided against it.\r\n\"How'd he know where to find me?\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed. \"He helped you build the place. Now where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Goddammit, Beth, I told you! How many times do I have to tell you that\r\nhe vanished!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop yelling at me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then believe me! It happened! I saw it happen, and I wasn't seeing\r\nthings! Go out and look. If you can find his body out there, I'll eat\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nShe uttered a little cry and came into his arms, holding him tightly.\r\n\"Oh, darling, I want to believe you. I want very much to believe you;\r\nbut men can't vanish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brice did.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. If you say he did. All right. Now what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I have to think. I have to try and remember what happened\r\nto me. It's the only way that this crazy whirl will make sense, and it\r\nhas to make sense. It has to.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"Let's go into the room. I want to be with you tonight. Let\r\nme have the gun, dear?\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, his jaws knotted. \"You think I'm nuts, don't you? You\r\nthink I'm crazy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Darling, darling, of course not. But I wish you'd give me the gun.\"\r\n\r\nResignedly he unstrapped the gun and gave it to her. He shrugged. \"I\r\ndon't blame you. Hell, I think I'm crazy too.\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't argue the point.\r\n\r\nThey both went into the front room and sat there staring into the ashes\r\nof the dead fireplace while dusk fell about the cabin. Finally Beth\r\nstarted the fire. When she had finished, she bent and kissed him.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't we get some sleep, honey,\" she said. \"That may help.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be up later,\" he told her and she kissed him again. Then she went\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nHow long he sat there he had no way of knowing, but the fire was\r\nsteadily dying. The thoughts hammered in his head and he became lost in\r\nthem, trying mentally to find the key that would tear away the veil and\r\ngrant him a peek at his past. Bits and snatches had filtered through,\r\ngarbled and incoherent, that had tried to shed light yet could not. And,\r\nwhile he leaned toward one conclusion, drawn from the dreams, he felt it\r\ntoo fantastic for belief.\r\n\r\nHe was so absorbed in his thinking that he never heard the door open\r\nslowly. When he did hear the soft tread behind him, it was too late! A\r\nhandkerchief of chloroform was clamped strongly over his face! He\r\nstruggled, trying to get away from the hands that held him, but he was\r\npowerless! The chloroform got to him. He couldn't breathe...\r\n\r\nHe slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ship came to rest upon a flat, ochre colored plain beside a\r\nbrilliant white city encased in thick, heavy walls. There was a dull\r\npain in his head and fire in his leg, but he was alive. He lay limply\r\nupon the bed while Firstspacer Narvi plied him with honeywine to dull\r\nthe pain.\r\n\r\nHe grinned, studying the blond giant's warm, friendly face. He was among\r\nfriends; the tall, yellow eyed Thistians had failed to kill him and\r\nNarvi had whisked him away into the violet sky.\r\n\r\n\"Thought we'd lost you, Lors,\" Narvi grinned. \"You almost did,\" he\r\nreplied, choking on the Thista honeywine. \"Haven't you anything else,\r\nsomething from Darkkan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, friend,\" Narvi grinned, \"but you can be glad to get this. The\r\n36th Command has been drinking up even this stuff. I'll see you later,\r\nin the hospital.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Narvi.\" The big man started away, but Lors stopped him by\r\ngrabbing his blue sleeve. \"Narvi?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks. Thanks a lot.\"\r\n\r\nFirstspacer Narvi punched him playfully on the arm and left the\r\ncompartment. The medical men came in then, hooking the anti-gravity\r\ncapsules to the bed and setting them into motion. The cot-like stretcher\r\nlifted and the men towed him out to the freight elevator. As they stowed\r\nhim into the ambulance, he could see Narvi's staff car skimming toward\r\nthe Commandant's building to make out his report.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Commandant Imry would be coming to see him, later on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNick groaned. Another dream that was beginning to clear things up a\r\nlittle...\r\n\r\n\"He's coming around.\" The words were not English, but Nick understood\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe big blond cursed softly. \"Speak English, Thesa. Someone might hear\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"There hasn't been anyone around this farm in months,\" Thesa replied,\r\nlapsing into English. \"But if you're getting particular, don't call me\r\nThesa.\"\r\n\r\nNick opened his eyes and blinked at them. It was the two watch dogs, the\r\nblond and his sandy haired friend. The giant was grinning at him.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" he beamed. \"Remember me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! Who in hell are you?\" Nick struggled to get out of the chair he'd\r\nbeen dumped in, but was pushed back firmly.\r\n\r\n\"When you didn't report, we went out to find you. The old guy at the gas\r\nstation covered up for you, so we had to watch Beth's house. Used all\r\nkinds of tricks, Lors. Why in the blue heaven didn't you make contact?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're Narvi!\" Nick stared with wide eyes. \"You're the man in the\r\ndream!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dream? Say, what's wrong with you, Lors? You refuse to report, you take\r\npot shots at us... That crash was a bad thing; don't tell me your\r\nhead...\"\r\n\r\n\"Narvi,\" Thesa put in quickly. \"The crash! He was lucky to get out of it\r\nalive. Maybe he can't remember what went on. That right, Lors?\"\r\n\r\nNick stared at them and foggy pictures swung vaguely into his mind.\r\nGalaxies of stars whirled about, silver ships streaking in the sky and\r\ntiny points of light whipping across ochre deserts. Men in blue uniforms\r\ndrilling beneath a violet sky in the heat of a solar wafer splotched\r\nabove them. It was real! The fears he had had, the crazy alternative\r\nthat the dreams presented to him ... it was all real.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't a dream,\" Nick muttered, shaking his head like a punch-drunk\r\nfighter. \"I really am Firstspacer Lors! And I know you! I know you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy, boy,\" Narvi said softly. \"You've had a bad time. I might\r\nhave known you _couldn't_ report to us. Thesa, get some water! He looks\r\nas though he's going to pass out!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right, I'm all right.\" He looked at Narvi and the memories, at\r\nleast a few of them, came fluttering into place. The temporary amnesia\r\nslipped aside and the veil began to rise.\r\n\r\n\"You're sure you're all right, Lors?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Narvi. Things are beginning to make sense. Tell me about what I'm\r\ndoing here.\"\r\n\r\nNarvi cursed angrily. \"Commander Imry, the stupid thistlebug! It's all\r\nhis fault! All this fouled up thing is his doing. It would have been bad\r\nenough even without your ship crashing; that just added to it. Luckily,\r\nImry has been ordered back. Someone back home heard of his idiotic plan\r\nand the government is yelling for his hide.\"\r\n\r\n\"What plan? I ... can't...\"\r\n\r\nThesa came in with a glass of water and handed it to Lors, who sipped at\r\nit slowly while the big blond explained things to him. While Narvi\r\ntalked, it all began to come into sharp focus in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"After you and I finished campaigning on Darkkan and Thista, we applied\r\nfor assignment in this galaxy. They wanted to split us up, at first,\"\r\nNarvi grinned, \"but we got mad, so they left us together and we were\r\nshipped here under old Commander Imry. After a couple of years, Terran\r\ntime, studying on Mars we became agents on this planet. I got an easy\r\none here with Thesa, but Imry had bigger plans for you. Damn him!\"\r\n\r\n\"But why are we spying on these people, Narvi? For war?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not. The Terrans are getting close to space travel, and you know\r\nwhat that would do to our colonies in this galaxy. They're entering a\r\nprimitive Atomic civilization and they're like little children playing\r\nwith weapons. Oh, they're serious enough, but they're so damned careless\r\nthey're likely to ruin the planet in atomic wars...\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like the ancient history of our own planet,\" Lors said softly.\r\nThe memories were coming in faster now.\r\n\r\n\"True. And you know what happened to us? Damned near lost the whole\r\nplanet. Anyhow, you know the other planets in this galaxy? Well, since\r\nTerra has a life form like ours, we could use this place as a link in\r\nthe supply chain. That is our main purpose. Trade.\r\n\r\n\"But these people have a strange attitude. Why, if we would land a ship\r\nnow, they'd rip us to shreds before you knew it. These people fear what\r\nthey don't understand, and anything they can't understand they kill. So,\r\nright now, we're sending agents, or spies, down here with instructions\r\nto probe about. They're coming along rather well, getting out of the\r\ntrees, you might say; but we'll have to keep an eye on them for awhile\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\nLors finished the water. \"But what has this got to do with Commander\r\nImry and me? Apparently I was to take the place of Nick Danson, but\r\nwhy?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was Imry. You see, many times our agents are handicapped by the\r\nvery lives they lead. In order to learn about people, one has to live\r\nwith them; when our agents do this, they have to get jobs and settle\r\ndown in one area. Imry picked Danson because he's a footloose artist who\r\npaints illustrations for magazines. All he had to do was snatch Danson,\r\nwork a little plastic surgery on you and put you in Nick Danson's place.\r\nYou then, would not be confined and could roam all over the planet\r\nwithout being questioned.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's crazy,\" Lors told him. \"I couldn't take Danson's place for the\r\nrest of my life. He was gambling on a hell of a lot.\"\r\n\r\nNarvi grunted. \"You're a good spacer, Lors. You follow orders, even when\r\nthey're dictated by a madman. When you left the ship, you _were_ Danson.\r\nYou were processed so beautifully that no one could tell the difference.\r\nWhen you cracked up, a blow on the head, or something, must have created\r\na temporary amnesia and you thought you _were_ Danson. We certainly had\r\na time locating you. Anyhow, you're to go back to the ship as soon as\r\nyou can. The new commander wants to talk with you.\" Narvi grinned slyly.\r\n\"I imagine you'll want to talk to him too. It's Zark, our old friend\r\nfrom Thista.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zark. Yes. I remember him.\" Lors stood up and paced the room in\r\nthought. He remembered grey haired, friendly Zark, but more than that,\r\nhe remembered Commander Zark's beautiful, blond daughter, Jela. \"I\r\nremember a lot now, Narvi. It's too bad they didn't send him sooner.\r\nThings wouldn't be so messed up.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not so bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. You'll probably be going back to the home planet now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't go back,\" Lors mused. \"I have to stay and see this through.\r\nIt's personal, now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Personal?\" Narvi was clearly puzzled. \"What can be personal about a\r\nSpacer and an alien race?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at his friend levelly. \"I can't leave this planet, Narvi,\r\nbecause of Beth Danson. I'm in love with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love!\" Narvi exploded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the heavy silence that followed, the two men stared at one another.\r\nLors regarded his friend with matter-of-fact calmness, but Narvi's mouth\r\nwas open in astonishment. The situation wasn't covered in the manual.\r\n\r\n\"Love,\" Narvi choked finally. \"With an alien? You must be joking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"That blow on the head must have been solid as a rock.\"\r\n\r\nThesa just stared, without speaking.\r\n\r\n\"Beth is a wonderful woman and I'm in love with her. If the blow on the\r\nhead did that ... well then, I'm glad the ship cracked up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Lors! She's an alien! It's like a farmer, falling in love with his\r\nstock! It's crazy! You couldn't live on this planet the rest of your\r\nlife, and she couldn't live with you!\"\r\n\r\nLors shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"What about Jela,\" Narvi demanded swiftly.\r\n\r\nHe didn't answer him. Memories of the blond woman with the trim ankles,\r\nthe slim waist and the large breasts floated back to him; memories of\r\nthe many evenings they'd shared walking along the sand under the stars.\r\nHe sat there fingering the thoughts as they rolled past, without feeling\r\nanything. He was aware, finally, that Narvi was speaking to him.\r\n\r\n\"... know how you feel, Lors, but forget it. You could never work\r\nanything out. Go on back to Jela and forget about this alien. It doesn't\r\nmatter how wonderful she is; probably nothing short of killing her\r\nhusband would gain her for you.\"\r\n\r\nLors smiled thinly. \"We can do that, too.\" He paused and looked\r\nthoughtful for a moment \"What did Imry do with Danson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. He lives better than most spacers. Since we are minus prisons\r\non starships, Imry installed him in your quarters, under guard, of\r\ncourse. Commander Zark hasn't been able to figure out what to do with\r\nhim, yet. That's what he wants to talk to you about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a scout ship here?\" Lors asked.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. We use them to make reports. The Terrans would pick up the\r\nradio waves otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about a uniform?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can borrow one of Thesa's. You'd never get into one of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. As soon as I'm properly attired, we'll go see Zark.\" Grinning at\r\nNarvi, Lors followed Thesa into the bedroom for the uniform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, dressed in the uniform of a Firstspacer, Lors checked himself in\r\nthe mirror of the bedroom making certain that he was properly dressed.\r\nTrousers bloused neatly into the black, half boots, the yellow stripes\r\nperfectly aligned, the cuffs of the tunic fastened at his wrists and\r\nthroat, the emblems of the 8th. Terran Command on the collar, the patch\r\nof rank on his left shoulder sleeve. Yes, he was all set. Precise.\r\n\r\nHe grinned at Thesa. \"Feels good,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe sandy haired spacer handed him the black leather belt containing the\r\nauto-pistol and the cartridge belt. He buckled it on, feeling the\r\nfamiliar weight drag at his right hip.\r\n\r\n\"Okay?\" Thesa asked.\r\n\r\nLors nodded. \"Thanks for the loan,\" he said and went out to where Narvi,\r\nalready dressed, awaited him.\r\n\r\n\"How's your head?\" Narvi asked.\r\n\r\n\"Fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go, then.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked, wordlessly, out to the barn. The blond snapped on a small\r\nlight near the scout ship and Lors went up close to examine it.\r\n\r\n\"Climb in,\" Narvi invited. \"I have to scan the area and make sure no one\r\nwill see the take-off.\"\r\n\r\nLors leaped to the cockpit and opened the plastic-dome; he dropped\r\nlithely into the seat, his feet moving automatically to the rudder\r\npedals, his hands impatiently fingering the controls. So much was coming\r\nback. So many remembrances with each second of time. He was _not_\r\nNicholas Howard Danson, and he had never been! He was Firstspacer Lors\r\nof the 8th. Terran Command, and he felt his heart thrill to the\r\nknowledge of who he was and where he was. It was slow, this strange\r\nprocess of regaining his mind, but it was coming along. He would soon be\r\nwhole again, no longer some freak caught in the vortex between two\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\n\"Ready?\" Narvi asked, slipping into the seat beside him and pulling the\r\ncockpit shield into place.\r\n\r\n\"Ready. Where's the starship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bearing 204.5, off-planet. We'll be there in no time.\"\r\n\r\nThe barn door swung open as Narvi started the scout ship and they moved\r\nout into the night, hovering a foot off the barn floor until they were\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nNarvi conned the ship, working the verti-control expertly and the\r\nlittle craft whistled upward at a gentle speed. The radar screen before\r\nthem disclosed no aircraft in the area. Narvi grinned at Lors and shoved\r\nthe speed control forward, working the elevators with his other hand and\r\nthe scout ship streaked into the night sky.\r\n\r\nHome.\r\n\r\nLors, watching the screen, saw the oblong shape of the mother ship blurp\r\ninto view and called out its position to his friend. At once, Narvi\r\naltered the course, whipping the scout ship onto a collision bearing.\r\nWhen they were close enough, they used their signal and heard it\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nThe ship slipped in easily as the port opened in the starship's side.\r\nNarvi guided the craft in with tender hands and settled it gently on the\r\nfloor. A positioner hooked a line to the ship and pulled it quickly into\r\nthe repair bins. A light winked in the wall. The area was again\r\npressurized.\r\n\r\nThey climbed out and dropped to the floor as a crew of repair men went\r\nto work on the ship. Narvi slapped Lors on the arm.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going below for a drink. Join Me?\"\r\n\r\nLors shook his head. \"No, thanks. I might be down a bit later, but right\r\nnow I'd best talk to the Commander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. Just don't tell him that you're thinking of jilting his only\r\ndaughter for an alien, or he'll turn four different shades of purple.\"\r\n\r\nLors grinned and watched the big blond stride away to the elevator that\r\nwould take him down to the bar on the first level. Then he walked off in\r\nthe opposite direction, heading toward the forward end of the ship\r\nwhere he would find his \"future\" father-in-law, Commander Zark. Spacers,\r\nin the gleaming halls, saluted him in the traditional manner - a hand\r\nclasped to the hip that held their holstered auto-pistol - and it was a\r\ngood feeling. He had almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe Commander's guards stopped him outside the door, but when he\r\nexplained who he was and what he wanted, they nodded in unison. One of\r\nthem pressed a button which opened the door to the vestibule outside the\r\nCommander's office.\r\n\r\nLors stepped inside and the door hummed shut behind him. The vestibule\r\nwas little more than a box-like room, containing a small visi-screen. He\r\npressed the small, black button at the base of the dark screen and kept\r\nhis finger on it while the lines waved.\r\n\r\n\"Firstspacer Lors to see the Commander,\" he said, as the rotund face of\r\nhis future father-in-law waved and blurred into focus.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Lors! Come in!\" Zark's voice was a bellow of pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe heavy door swung open and Lors stepped into the room to click his\r\nheels and slap his right hand against the black holster before the\r\nCommander's desk.\r\n\r\n\"Firstspacer Lors reporting, sir,\" he said, as Zark got up from the\r\nchair and came toward him.\r\n\r\n\"Lors, Lors, my son! How are you?\"\r\n\r\nThey grabbed each other by the shoulders and laughed like children.\r\nLors, despite his love for Beth Danson and the trouble that was\r\nundoubtedly coming up, was happy as a Terran child at Christmas to see\r\nthe older man.\r\n\r\n\"Lors! Let me look at you! It's been eons since Thista! Jela's fair\r\ndying to get her hands on you again.\" He winked at Lors. \"And I imagine\r\nyou are, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's here?\" A ray of panic touched him and he hoped that it didn't\r\nshow.\r\n\r\n\"Not that I know of, unless a ship came in. The last I heard, she was\r\nwaiting for a ship to take her off the base on Mars. She swears she'll\r\nget you this time, or she's going back home to find an old mushshell\r\ngatherer.\"\r\n\r\nLors laughed with Zark, who released him to pull a flask of wine from\r\nhis desk. As he poured two tumblers of the milk-white wine, he winked at\r\nthe young spacer.\r\n\r\n\"From the home planet,\" he grinned. \"Mallowine. I'll wager you haven't\r\ntasted it in a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not since Thista,\" Lors assured him, accepting the tumbler. He held up\r\nthe glass for a toast. \"To you, sir, and your daughter. May she be saved\r\nfrom marrying a mushshell gatherer.\"\r\n\r\nCommander Zark chuckled and they drank, the soft, mellow taste of the\r\nwine lingering fondly in their mouths long after the drink had found its\r\nway into their stomachs.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, Lors. Tell me what that fool of an Imry did to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe told the Commander everything, watching the older man nod his head\r\nfrom time to time, the stubby fingers of his hands forming a pyramid\r\nbefore his lips as he slumped in his chair. Lors left nothing out,\r\nexcept his love for Beth Danson. He couldn't bring himself to tell about\r\nthat. When he had finished, Commander Zark's eyes were hot with angry\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\"I'll see that Imry cannot get a command on a planet with a pure ammonia\r\natmosphere for this trick! I'll see him tortured by Thistians!\" The old\r\nman stopped his tirade as quickly as he had begun it. \"You know what\r\nthis means, Lors?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid to guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wrecked scout ship can be covered up easily enough because of the\r\nTerran politics; they always arrange it so that one branch of government\r\nhas no idea of what the other branches are doing. We'll have some of our\r\nmen in Washington mumble in their beards about experimental aircraft\r\nuntil everyone is taken from the scene except our people. Then we'll\r\nhave the ship taken somewhere, ostensibly to be studied, and they'll all\r\nforget it.\r\n\r\n\"But these Terrans are another matter. If they can get their people to\r\nlisten to them, we're in trouble...\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Lors said softly, \"if they were believed, it would speed up\r\nour relations with the Terran governments.\"\r\n\r\nZark shook his grey head. \"No. They aren't ready yet. They're still in\r\nsuch a fluctuating state that half the population believes in witchcraft\r\nand superstition, while the other half understands science and looks\r\ntoward the future.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, Lors, others have tried those same tactics and were not\r\nbelieved. To tell the truth, I'm not quite sure _what_ to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could continue the bluff.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commander's brows lifted. \"You mean you continue as our agent down\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. The way it worked out, with the crash, it merely supported\r\nthe story I was to tell Danson's wife. I really did have temporary\r\namnesia. No one knows anything, except about the ship. Brice found\r\nDanson's watch at the crash site, but we could work a little mental\r\ntrick on him and make him forget everything he knows, couldn't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be risky. You never know if that process will work until it is\r\ntried. As much as I hate the thought, it would be best to kill both of\r\nthem and send you back to the Terran woman. After we had tried to bluff\r\nout Imry's plan for a month, or so, we could arrange an accident for you\r\nin which it would appear that you were dead - perhaps utilizing the real\r\nDanson for the accident. Does the woman suspect anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Lors told him. \"She seems too happy in having me\r\nback, at the moment.\"\r\n\r\nZark smiled at him and clamped a hand to his shoulder. \"You're tired, my\r\nboy. Get some rest and we'll talk about this thing later. You can use\r\nFirstspacer Thesa's quarters. Danson is in yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Brice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unconscious. In the hospital. The shock of what took place down there\r\nhas him recalling every old wives' tale about witches that he has ever\r\nheard.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, sir,\" Lors said smiling. \"I'll get to my quarters, then.\r\nThank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll send Jela to you, if she comes in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" Lors said, but felt shaken at the thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside, in the corridor, Lors nodded to the guards and began walking\r\ntoward Thesa's quarters. In his mind, now that he again _had_ a whole\r\nmind, was the feeling of being trapped, the feeling of being caught in a\r\nmesh-like web that was about to strangle him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they could patch things up on Terra, but the two Terrans would\r\nhave to die, or at least one - merely to gain him another month, or two,\r\nwith Beth. Was it worth it? In the long run, was it practical? Perhaps\r\nhe didn't really love the Terran woman - maybe it was just infatuation,\r\nor gratitude, or even the result of long abstinence. If that was the\r\ncase, it would be brutal for them to kill the one man who could make her\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nThen, on the other hand, suppose his love was genuine. If he really\r\nloved her, the coming accident which he was to stage would never come to\r\npass. He knew himself too well to believe that. He would take Beth and\r\nrun, get away into another country, change his name, his features...\r\n\r\nHe smiled to himself and remembered his training on Mars, and the\r\nability of the spacemen to reach out with a long arm to stop anything.\r\nAnything! _We are the gods, he remembered. We are the gods who move with\r\nlightning and speak in thunder. The Terrans are like so many cows that\r\nneed a watchful eye upon them at all times..._\r\n\r\nGods. Yes, in a manner of speaking, he decided that they were gods ...\r\nbut what did the book say about one of the minor gods being caught up\r\nin a crazy thing like this? It had never happened before.\r\n\r\nWithout actually realizing it, he found himself standing at the door to\r\nhis own quarters. A single guard, armed with an auto-rifle stopped him\r\nwhen he approached the door.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" the Spacer said. \"You cannot enter here.\"\r\n\r\nDanson was on the other side, he knew. Nicholas Danson, the artist, the\r\nman with whom he had traded places. Suddenly he wanted to speak with the\r\nman, find out about him. All at once, Danson was not just another Terran\r\n- he was a man, with feelings, emotion...\r\n\r\n\"I'm Firstspacer Lors,\" he heard his voice rumble with authority. \"I'd\r\nlike to speak with the Terran.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard stiffened. \"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't know who you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will open the door, spacer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, but you'd best leave your sidearm with me.\"\r\n\r\nLors nodded and pulled his auto-pistol from the black leather holster\r\nand handed it to the guard who stuffed it into his belt. He reached back\r\nand unlocked the door. As it swung open, Lors stepped inside.\r\n\r\nThe room was not large; it couldn't be very big on a starship, but it\r\nwas serviceable. There was a dresser and locker for uniforms, as well as\r\na visi-screen, a couch and a small bed. The Terran was lying on the bed,\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nLors smiled at him. They could have been twins of the same mother, were\r\nit not for the fact that Terran's disposition was different. He hadn't\r\nshaved in a few days, and his black hair was tangled. Even the fatigue\r\nuniform he wore was rumpled badly.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Danson,\" Lors said, in English, and to his acute surprise, the\r\nTerran answered in Lors' tongue.\r\n\r\n\"This mortal bids welcome to the great god, Lors,\" Danson said, with a\r\nfaint smirk.\r\n\r\n\"You speak my language?\" Lors asked, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? You speak mine. When they checked my brain, they found that I\r\nhad a rather high I.Q. Besides, I've read all your reading material and\r\ndecided that you have lousy taste. So I decided to learn the language,\r\nand try to make conversation with my watch dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are comfortable?\"\r\n\r\nDanson nodded. \"Wonderful. First rate. Now that I know the language, I'm\r\ngoing to get a deck of cards and teach my jailers how to play draw\r\npoker. Then I'm going to win this starship and take it to Washington for\r\nanalysis.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't come here to jest.\"\r\n\r\nDanson lit a cigarette and smiled thinly. \"Why did you come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"To see you. Are you well taken care of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. They've hooked up my pint sized T.V. set so that I can look\r\nat the earth. I've been to the Lunar Base ... terrific real estate. A\r\nrock pile. Elaborate, but still a rock pile. I eat very well. I sleep\r\noccasionally, except that I cannot get used to the total darkness, and I\r\nhave minor grievances ... like I want to get the hell out of here!\" He\r\nstood up suddenly and glared at Lors. \"Am I happy! Am I content! Hell,\r\nyes! I'm so goddam content I'm going stir crazy from it!\r\n\r\n\"I'm sick of the whole damned mess, Firstspacer Lors, plain downright\r\nsick and...\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy, Danson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up! Shut your damned mouth because I'm not finished! Tell me, god,\r\nhave you ever been confined to a pint sized prison? You ever had your\r\nbrain picked clean by a flock of intellectual buzzards? You ever sat in\r\na room, with the walls closing in on you, listening to a couple of\r\nblue-uniformed knotheads stand outside your door talking a babble of\r\nlanguage that sounded like Chinese, and not be able to speak to them?\r\nNot be able to take a piss because you don't know how to find the toilet\r\nand don't know how to ask where it is?\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have. I have and I'm up to my ears with this whole bit. I lie\r\nhere every night and dream about taking this so-called starship and\r\nramming it up your ass, plate by plate...\"\r\n\r\nDanson broke off suddenly, unable to continue his wild tirade. He sat\r\nthere on the edge of the bunk, his face a livid white, with the\r\ncigarette dangling from his lips. His left eye closed against the bite\r\nof the smoke and his jaws knotted as he stared at the wall.\r\n\r\n\"All finished,\" Lors demanded quietly.\r\n\r\nDanson grunted. \"Yeah. Yeah, ace, I'm all finished. In a way, I'm sorry\r\n... but it felt good. I've wanted to get all that off my chest for a\r\nlong time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see your position, Danson,\" Lors told him. \"I know what you've\r\nbeen through, but I can't do anything about it. I follow orders.\"\r\n\r\nDanson grinned. \"Who're you trying to kid, pal. You got Commander Zark's\r\ndaughter eating out of the palm of your hand. Hell, I'll bet you pull\r\nmore strings around this ship than a puppeteer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've underestimated you, Danson,\" Lors told him in a soft voice. \"You\r\nhave an interesting mind. Quite a grasp.\"\r\n\r\nDanson snorted again. \"You guys aren't the sharpest people in the world.\r\nI will give you a bit of advice, for free. You better either return me\r\nto earth, or kill me. In another thirteen months, I'll figure out a way\r\nto blow this hulk into a million pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt that,\" Lors mused.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead and doubt it, but you'd better keep the powder magazine under\r\ndouble guard. And while you're at it, you better have the boys be\r\ncareful of what they say around me, since I know the lingo.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many Spacers have you talked to?\" Lors asked. \"How many of them\r\nknow how intelligent you are?\"\r\n\r\nDanson shrugged. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just wondered.\"\r\n\r\nNick Danson looked at him narrowly. \"You have something on your mind,\r\nLors?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe. Right now, I'll keep it to myself. Until then, keep your mouth\r\nshut about how smart you are. A weapon, Nick, is only useful when the\r\nenemy doesn't know how well it will work. When they know, a\r\ncounter-weapon can be made.\" Lors moved to the door. \"I'll be back,\r\nprobably,\" he said and went out into the corridor, leaving the Terran to\r\nponder on what he had said.\r\n\r\nThe guard snapped to attention, then handed Lors his auto-pistol. The\r\nFirstspacer slipped it into the holster and snapped the flap. Then he\r\nwalked rapidly toward Firstspacer Thesa's quarters with the germ of an\r\nidea filtering and dancing through his mind.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't a complete idea, but it certainly was a wild one. The chances\r\nof its working were about a thousand to one, but if it did things might\r\nwork out.\r\n\r\nHe hoped so.\r\n\r\nHe reached the door of Thesa's quarters and jerked it open. His fingers\r\nfumbled for the button, inside the door, that would switch on the\r\nlighted walls. When he found it, he closed the door and flicked on the\r\nlights. He stared at the inside of the room in amazement.\r\n\r\nShe was lying on the bed, with her golden hair falling about her\r\nshoulders like a waterfall of sunlight, and her lips pulled back over\r\nwhite teeth to smile at him. But he was stunned, frozen to the spot.\r\n\r\n\"Jela,\" he whispered, in shock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment, she didn't move and, in the silence, he allowed his eyes\r\nto finger her.\r\n\r\nBeneath the blond tumble of hair, her blue eyes watched him, her lips\r\ntoying with a bemused smile. She wore the odd toga-like dress that had\r\nrecently become popular among the women on the home planet; it was a\r\nwhite color, trimmed in a pale blue that went well with her hair, but\r\nLors hardly noticed it. His eyes were fixed upon the twin lift of her\r\nbreasts as they fought against the material.\r\n\r\nShe swung her long, curved legs to the floor, a momentary flash of\r\ncreamy flesh showing at her thighs, and stood up. She came to him on\r\nslippered feet, whispering against the floor and stopped before him, her\r\nbreasts faintly brushing the material of his tunic.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I'd never get here, darling.\" Her voice was soft and warm.\r\nSex, love and desire hung in her words; the emotion dripped from her\r\nvoice the way water falls from the roof of a cave, giving her tone a\r\nthroaty huskiness that started the blood racing in his veins. Yet she\r\nheld herself back, restrained her urge to fling herself into his arms.\r\nIt was a game with her, one she had always played. \"Did you miss me?\"\r\nShe asked.\r\n\r\nHe nodded, unable to trust his voice. It would crack, he knew it would.\r\nHe would be able to say nothing beyond a mere croak. Too much was\r\nhappening, too damned fast. It was almost impossible to keep up with it\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she mused. \"I realize you're stunned to see me, but you ought to\r\nkiss me. At least, that.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached out his hands slowly, feeling the tremble begin in his\r\nfingers as he closed them over the softness of her upper arms. A drum\r\nbegan pounding in his temples as he touched her, a flashflood ripped\r\nthrough his veins, and his stomach churned like a storm. He brought his\r\nmouth down slowly against hers and felt her lithe body flatten up\r\nagainst him the way a candle melts against a sheet of hot metal.\r\n\r\nHer mouth was a pliant sweetness that shoved all his thoughts of Terra\r\ninto the back of his mind; her body trembled against the lean hardness\r\nof his in a shiver of passion. The very touch of her tongue against his\r\nlips beat aside all the problems that swirled about his muddled mind and\r\nawakened the desire and need that had lain dormant within him all this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Darling,\" she breathed, when he had pulled his mouth from hers. \"Oh,\r\nLors...\"\r\n\r\n\"Shhh.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no need for talking, no sense in it at all. Her body mashed up\r\nagainst him and he allowed his hands to smooth down over the material of\r\nher dress, along the curve of her spine to the twin globes of her\r\nbuttocks. Her mouth lifted to his again, eager, demanding, while her\r\nfingers dug through his tunic and into his flesh with a sharp need that\r\nthrilled him.\r\n\r\nHer hand reached behind him, her fingers finding the light button and\r\nsuddenly the room was sheathed in the soft cloak of darkness. Only the\r\ntiny nightlight gleamed like a small, yellow eye in the center of the\r\nceiling. She spoke to him, without removing her lips, her breath hot and\r\ndemanding against his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to wait any longer, darling,\" she panted, \"not another\r\nminute.\"\r\n\r\nHis arms slid around her, lifting her at the shoulders and the thighs to\r\ncarry her to the bed, but she twisted away from him, whirling off into a\r\ndarkened corner of the room where the yellow light could not touch. He\r\ncould hear the sigh of the toga-like robe as she whipped it away from\r\nher soft flesh. Then she stood there, before him, framed in the alluring\r\ngold of the circle of light.\r\n\r\nLors felt his breath suck inward at the sight of her, standing there\r\nnude. She was even more beautiful than he had remembered and he felt\r\nshaken, to the very roots of his being.\r\n\r\nThe smooth curve of her shoulders glowed in the light and her face was\r\nkissed by shadows. The arching lift of her breasts and the impassioned\r\nnipples threw a wash of dark shadow downward over the flat of her\r\nstomach and the lithe curve of her thighs. With the light covering the\r\nbeauty of her face, Jela lost her identity.\r\n\r\nShe was woman. Period.\r\n\r\nAny and all, from time immemorial, or immoral, perhaps. She was somehow,\r\nstanding there, a composite of every woman who had ever drawn a breath.\r\nShe was the best of woman, the choicest parts of all women since the\r\ndawn of time, suddenly thrown together in a high breasted, slim waisted\r\ncreation that was being offered to him, only to him.\r\n\r\nAnd Lors?\r\n\r\nIt moved in him, churned through his guts like a forest fire. He was\r\nman! All men, glaring with the red eyes of passion at all women. He too,\r\nin the wash of lust that had swept over him, lost his identity and he\r\ndidn't give a damn. It didn't matter. Nothing mattered except that she\r\nwas waiting...\r\n\r\nHis fingers ripped away his clothing and he was at her side in no time\r\nat all, his arms sliding about the pliant warmth of her flesh to clasp\r\nher to him. To take her. To love her with a fever that was equal to the\r\nchallenge she presented.\r\n\r\nShe made a small sound and he hushed it with his mouth, planting his\r\nlips roughly against hers while he lowered her to the bed. He hurt her,\r\nbut she didn't try to get away.\r\n\r\nIt was the kind of hurt she had waited for, that they both had yearned\r\nfor all the long months that had kept them apart. His hands closed over\r\nher. Smoothing the tender flesh and feeling of life beneath his palm.\r\n\r\nShe moaned, tearing the sound from the very depths of her as his hands\r\nsmoothed the satiny texture of her thighs, his fingers working against\r\nher flesh. He felt the nails of her hands digging into his shoulders,\r\nbut he paid no attention to it.\r\n\r\nNothing mattered now. Nothing except the warmth of their love and the\r\nexpenditure of the raging passions that threatened to engulf them both.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey laid there for a long time, basking in the heat of their love, and\r\nhe knew. Finally he knew that it all would not work. There could be\r\nnothing between him and the Terran woman. It was impossible. She could\r\nnot live in his worlds, nor could he live in hers. Jela was his world\r\nand the past was merely an emotional thing. A moth and the flame.\r\n\r\nYet ... somehow, he _did_ love Beth. Somehow her and her life was\r\nimportant to him. Her happiness was something that he had to assure. Had\r\nto guarantee for her.\r\n\r\nHe had to work out a plan that would solve everything and return the\r\nwhole business to a state of normalcy. It would be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, and he knew that Zark would never listen to him, never allow\r\nhim to carry it out.\r\n\r\nBut he had to do it.\r\n\r\nThere would be all kinds of risks and, if he failed in the thing, he\r\nmight have to pay with his life. If he managed to accomplish it, he\r\nwould get nothing as a reward, except perhaps the hand of the\r\nCommander's daughter. That wasn't such a bad reward, though.\r\n\r\nHe kissed her and the fires began to burn again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nLors finished dressing himself, buckling the black belt about his waist;\r\nthen he looked down at the still form of Zark's daughter, Jela, golden\r\nin the light of the overhead bulb. She slept like a baby. He blew a kiss\r\nto her and let his breath out in a rush.\r\n\r\n\"If everything goes right,\" he whispered, \"I'll be back before you know\r\nI'm gone. If not...\" He let it hang there and checked the loads in the\r\nauto-pistol.\r\n\r\nThen he went out into the bright light of the corridor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe guard merely accepted his auto-pistol when he stopped at the door to\r\nDanson's prison. Lors gave it to him and the spacer opened the door.\r\nNick Danson rubbed the beard on his face and grinned at him.\r\n\r\n\"Forget something, Firstspacer?\" He asked.\r\n\r\nWhen the door closed, Lors said: \"Shut up.\"\r\n\r\nDanson blinked.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down.\"\r\n\r\nDanson sat.\r\n\r\n\"How badly do you want to get off this ship, Danson?\"\r\n\r\n\"How badly do you want to make Commander?\" Danson countered and lit a\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\n\"You willing to risk your life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? It isn't worth a hell of a lot anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nLors reached into Danson's shirt pocket, found the pack of cigarettes\r\nand filched one. Nick touched a match to it and Lors dragged the smoke\r\ninto his lungs. He could see the Terran regarding him suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"What's the play, Firstspacer?\" Danson asked.\r\n\r\n\"You're dead, Nick,\" Lors said softly, \"if you stay on this ship. That\r\ncan be either literally, or figuratively speaking, I don't know. It all\r\ndepends on Zark's plans for you.\"\r\n\r\nNick snorted, \"Hell, Lors, it can't be any worse than whatever Imry had\r\ncooked up for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll be better. That I can assure you. Zark is a just man, but he\r\nhasn't much feeling for Terrans...\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I know. The \"god\" theory.\"\r\n\r\nLors nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Well, look, Firstspacer,\" Danson said, snubbing out his cigarette.\r\n\"Your concern for my welfare touches me deeply, but I don't get it. How\r\ncome?\"\r\n\r\nLors grinned. \"I've been asking myself that same question, and while I\r\ncan get answers that make sense to me, I sincerely doubt if they'd make\r\nsense to you.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't we just say I like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's rich, but I'll buy it. All I've got to lose is my chains...\"\r\n\r\n\"And your memory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come again?\"\r\n\r\nLors sucked on the cigarette. \"You can't talk about this thing to anyone\r\nexcept your wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who'd believe me anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's bigger than that, Danson. If you talk to anyone, I'll kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't make sense. Why not kill me now?\"\r\n\r\nLors sighed. \"Look, Commander Imry made a booboo, to use one of your\r\nterms, and I got caught in the middle. This whole operation is fouled up\r\nbecause of what he did. If we don't try to put things back, it's going\r\nto be in a real tough light.\r\n\r\n\"For the first time in history, Terra is in possession of a scout ship\r\neven though it is wrecked. Not only that, but they know it. They're hot\r\non the trail of us. And if enough Terrans get wise to us, we'll be in\r\ntrouble. You've read my diaries and journals. You know what it's like up\r\nhere. My planet needs Earth as a trade base, and if you people ever wake\r\nup as a race, we'll be able to help each other a hell of a lot. Maybe\r\nthat's why I want to take you back to your wife. Is that good enough for\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nDanson nodded. \"I guess so. I know enough about this situation to tell\r\nthat you're either on the level, or you're a damned convincing liar.\r\nWhat's the plot?\"\r\n\r\n\"The plot, as you put it, is to get you and Brice back to earth...\"\r\n\r\n\"Brice? Nolan Brice? He's here?\"\r\n\r\nLors nodded. \"Brice found your watch where my scout ship cracked up and\r\nguessed who I was before I did. I was hiding up at your cabin, trying to\r\nfigure things out when he decided to put a bullet into me. Both Beth and\r\nI thought I was you and she was trying to help me figure out what I'd\r\nbeen doing for thirteen months. Brice came in shooting and my people\r\nkidnapped him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great.\"\r\n\r\n\"In any event, I think I can get Brice to the scout ship. I'm going to\r\nrely upon you to spring yourself out of here and get down to the hangar.\r\nYou'll pass for me easily. Okay?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I get past the guard?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll fix it. If I can't, I'll be back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Buck Rogers. It's your show.\"\r\n\r\nLors grinned at him. \"Keep your fingers crossed,\" he said and went out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I won't do it,\" Narvi said flatly. He lifted his glass and took a large\r\nswallow of the drink to punctuate the sentence. \"You've got to,\" Lors\r\ninsisted. \"You know as well as I do, it's the only way to straighten\r\nthings out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk to Zark?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell him about it? What am I supposed to do? Tell him that I\r\nlove a Terran and want her to be happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thunder and lightning! What's so important about Brice and Danson?\r\nThey're only Terrans. This woman you're so silly about will find someone\r\nelse. Lors, by the gods, if you take those two back they'll talk to\r\neveryone they can get their hands on...\"\r\n\r\n\"No they won't, not Danson. Narvi, that's the beauty of this whole plot.\r\nDanson understands that our people simply want to begin trade\r\nnegotiations with Terra; he's learned to speak and read our language and\r\nhe knows how badly we want to trade with his people. He'll help us...\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Brice,\" Narvi snorted.\r\n\r\n\"Brice can be handled by Danson. If that doesn't work, we can threaten\r\nto do all sorts of things to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you want me to take the guard's place, outside Danson's quarters,\r\nand give you time to steal a scout ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nNarvi cast his blue eyes toward the ceiling and groaned aloud. \"If I\r\nkeep doing all these goofy things for you, I'll never make commander. I\r\nwon't even make Vice-commander.\"\r\n\r\nLors smiled. \"Don't worry about it. If things work out, you'll have had\r\na hand in opening up a new planet for our trade rockets.\"\r\n\r\nNarvi sighed. \"All right. I'll do it, although I should have my head\r\nexamined by the ship's doctors.\"\r\n\r\nLors grinned at him and finished the last of his drink. \"It'll work out,\r\nNarvi, and you'll probably get a medal.\"\r\n\r\n\"A prison cell, likely,\" Narvi snorted, \"on Thista.\"\r\n\r\nLors slapped him lightly on the arm and left the ship's wardroom. He had\r\na lot to do, and damned little time to do it in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nLors left the wardroom and walked along the hollow, brightly lighted\r\ncorridors toward the hospital where Detective Nolan Brice was being kept\r\na prisoner. He would be the tough one of the two, because his mental\r\nroots were still very close to the witchcraft believing parents who had\r\ngiven him birth.\r\n\r\nBrice was a Pennsylvanian; he was fairly intelligent, but like all\r\nPennsylvanians he had an unconscious closeness with tradition. He was of\r\nthe type who would stoutly deny he was superstitious, yet would refuse\r\nto walk under a ladder. How would he react to Lors' proposal? Would he,\r\nwith typical Dutch stubbornness, tell him to go to hell, or would he\r\nco-operate? It was a difficult thing to predict.\r\n\r\nLors shoved the door to the hospital open and grinned at the spacer\r\nbehind the desk. \"You've a Terran here?\" He asked.\r\n\r\nThe spacer nodded and laid down the sheets of paper he had been ruffling\r\nas Lors came in. \"Yes sir, we have one. He's in the care of Doctor\r\nZuloe.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they doing to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure, sir. I understand he was in a great state of shock when\r\nhe arrived. I would imagine they're giving him rehabilitative\r\ntreatment.\"\r\n\r\nLors grinned again. Apparently the method by which they had snatched the\r\ndetective had completely unnerved him. \"I'd like to see him,\" he told\r\nthe spacer. \"Where can I find Doctor Zuloe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Only authorized personnel will be allowed to\r\ninterrogate him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm authorized, I believe. I captured him. I'm Lors.\"\r\n\r\nThe young spacer flushed. \"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't know who you were.\"\r\nHe pointed to the door behind him. \"You may go through there. Straight\r\ndown the corridor until you reach the fourth ward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Zuloe will be there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nLors shoved the door open and walked down the long hall toward the\r\nfourth ward, not quite sure in his mind how he could spring the Terran\r\nfrom the hospital and get him down to where the scout ships were\r\nhangared. But it had to be done. If he failed, and they all ended up\r\ndead, or thrown into the penal colonies on Thista, the trade program\r\nwith Terra would be set back at least fifty years. All the ground they\r\nhad gained, all the knowledge and plans they had formulated, would be\r\nuseless. They would have to start from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe wrecked scout ship could be covered up, but the loss of Detective\r\nLieutenant Brice and Nicholas Danson would not go unnoticed, especially\r\nwhen Beth Danson spilled her story about the strange events that had\r\ngone on at the cabin. Of course, Terra would never be able to\r\ncorroborate what she had experienced - yet they were on the verge of\r\nspace travel, and they were a war-like race. They could cause all sorts\r\nof unnecessary trouble in space.\r\n\r\nIt had to work. He had to get both of them back to the planet, even if\r\nit meant stopping a slug from an auto-rifle to do it.\r\n\r\nHe reached the door to the fourth ward and went in to look for Doctor\r\nZuloe. The man wasn't hard to find; he was the only person in the small\r\nanteroom.\r\n\r\n\"What can I do for you, Firstspacer?\" He asked. \"I'm Doctor Zuloe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm Lors.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment, they stared at each other. The doctor was a middle-aged\r\nman with a weathered skin stretched over a rather aquiline set of\r\nfeatures. His small, bird-like eyes were piercing in their study of\r\nLors' face. He smiled thinly and ran a hand through greying hair.\r\n\r\n\"Lors, huh? You the one who went down there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in the accident. In a sense, I suppose I'm to blame for having\r\nbrought Brice up here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know him?\" Doctor Zuloe's eyes narrowed visibly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. At least, I think I know him better than you people do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps you can help us with him. When he arrived here, he was in\r\na state of acute shock in which he was almost violent. He kept screaming\r\nabout witchcraft and all sorts of Terran nonsense. We gave him as much\r\ntreatment as we could, under the circumstances, and he stopped acting\r\nlike a wildman.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is he now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Numb. He's sitting on his bed, in a special room, and staring at the\r\nwall.\"\r\n\r\n\"He isn't out of his mind, is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, but he has had a tremendous strain and shock. It'll\r\ntake awhile. He isn't of the same structure as the other one.\"\r\n\r\nLors sighed wearily. \"I'll see what I can do with him. Commander Zark\r\nhas plans for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another switch?\" The doctor made no attempt to cover his disgust over\r\nthe idea.\r\n\r\n\"An accident, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"From bad to worse, huh?\"\r\n\r\nLors didn't answer him. He merely made a motion with his hand for the\r\ndoctor to show him where the Terran was being kept. Doctor Zuloe nodded\r\nand pointed toward a door at the far end of the ward. A blue uniformed\r\nspacer stood guard before the door. He clicked his heels as Lors\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n\"I want to see the Terran, spacer,\" Lors said briskly.\r\n\r\nThe spacer nodded and opened the door. Lors stepped inside and listened\r\nto the lock click into place behind him.\r\n\r\nNolan Brice was seated on the edge of the bed staring at the wall, but\r\nLors did not believe that he was in a state of shock. He had the knotted\r\njaws of a man who is firmly determined to betray nothing to his captors.\r\nHe sat there with his fingers laced together, hanging between his knees,\r\nhis clothing rumpled and hanging loose from his broad frame.\r\n\r\n\"Nolan?\"\r\n\r\nBrice swung his eyes to the Firstspacer, the muscles of his jaws\r\nworking. \"I'll kill you,\" he said, with a horrible softness in his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Nolan. Listen, I'm here to help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've done a lot of helping, spaceman. I know what you want. Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly. I want to help you and Danson to get back home...\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't need you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up and listen. I'm risking my neck coming in here to help you, so\r\nyou damned well better follow orders. In a minute I'm going to call that\r\nguard in here, and we're going to borrow his uniform. Then we'll head\r\nfor a scout ship and get you to hell back to Terra. Will that suit\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is some kind of trick...\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to go, or stay here,\" Lors demanded coldly. \"I don't have\r\ntime to lecture you. I'll leave that up to your friend, Danson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Play it your way, spaceman,\" Brice said tightly.\r\n\r\n\"Okay.\" Lors stood up and spoke through the door to the guard, pulling\r\nhis auto-pistol from the holster. \"Come in here, spacer!\"\r\n\r\nThe guard shoved the door open and came in. \"What is it, Firstspacer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Him.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard swung to look at Brice and, as his head turned, Lors brought\r\nthe butt of the pistol down hard. The guard grunted and dropped heavily\r\nto the floor, his auto-rifle falling with a loud thud. By now, if\r\neverything was working out right, Danson should be on his way to the\r\nscout ship hangar. Lors looked at Brice.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Nolan. Get into these clothes!\"\r\n\r\nBetween the two of them, the stripping of the guard was fast. In a few\r\nminutes, Brice was wearing the spacer's blue uniform and was buckling\r\nthe black cartridge belt about his waist. He gripped the auto-rifle in\r\nhis hands eagerly and looked at Lors.\r\n\r\n\"Hand me his helmet,\" he said.\r\n\r\nLors picked it up and straightened to hand it to the Terran. Lors saw\r\nthe punch coming, but surprise prevented him from making any move in his\r\ndefense. Nolan Brice's fist smashed into the side of his face with\r\nstunning shock and he flew backwards onto the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" he heard Brice snarl.\r\n\r\nLors rolled off the bed and onto the floor, the force of the punch\r\nmaking his head reel. He heard the door to the room close and the sound\r\nof Brice's running feet outside as he staggered to his feet. You damned\r\nfool, he thought. You can't get off this ship alone!\r\n\r\nHe started running after the Terran, drawing his pistol as he ran...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nLors dashed down the hallway into the main corridor, passing the limp\r\nbody of the doctor and the young spacer who had been on duty at the\r\ndesk. Apparently, Brice had come into the place fast, swinging the\r\nauto-rifle like it was a club. Both of the men were unconscious, but\r\nthere was no blood in sight.\r\n\r\n\"Crazy fool,\" Lors said aloud and slammed the door as he dashed into the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\nBrice was running blindly.\r\n\r\n\"Brice! Stop!\" Lors fired the auto-pistol over the fleeing man's head.\r\n\r\nBrice stopped and whirled, dropping to one knee to bring up the rifle he\r\ncarried. He snapped off a fast burst and Lors dived across the polished\r\ncorridor to hug the wall. He landed, rolling, his pistol zeroed on the\r\nTerran, but he couldn't bring himself to shoot.\r\n\r\nNolan Brice, however, had no scruples about shooting at Lors. He fired\r\ncontinually, cursing as the bullets missed. Beyond the Terran, Lors\r\ncould see four other spacers running down the hall toward Brice. One of\r\nthem fired.\r\n\r\nBrice whirled, spotted them, and brought up his rifle. The gunfire, in\r\nthe emptiness of the hall, sounded like a machinegun being fired in a\r\ncave. Lors saw a spacer slam backwards, rolling crazily from the impact\r\nof the bullet that Brice had triggered.\r\n\r\nThe Terran was hunched over in a crouch, like an old gunfighter,\r\nshooting from the hip. Suddenly he jerked to his feet, spun crazily in\r\ntwo directions at once and fell flopping to the floor. The auto-rifle\r\nclattered as he let it fall.\r\n\r\nLors came slowly to his feet and shoved his gun back into its holster;\r\nthen he walked over to where Brice was staring at the ceiling through\r\nunseeing eyes. It was a damned shame, but he had brought it on himself.\r\nOne of the spacers looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right, sir?\"\r\n\r\nLors nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Is he a spacer?\" One of them asked, looking at the uniform.\r\n\r\n\"An escaped Terran,\" Lors said, then he remembered that Danson was\r\nprobably down at the hangar. \"Don't jettison this body until I give you\r\nthe orders. Put it in quick freeze.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" the spacer said.\r\n\r\nBut Lors was already on his way down the corridor. He could do nothing\r\nfor Brice now ... perhaps it had even been a good thing. The shooting\r\nwould have drawn most of the high ranking officers toward the end of the\r\nship, leaving a comparatively clear space between him and the hangar. He\r\nhoped that the doctor would stay out for awhile.\r\n\r\nAs the Terrans said, they weren't out of the woods yet.\r\n\r\nHe found a vacant elevator and took it down to the hangar level. As the\r\ndoor whirled open, he raced into the corridor, nearly upsetting a\r\nstartled spacer with his rush. He had no idea how long it would be until\r\nit was discovered that Narvi had let Danson out, but he knew the escape\r\nwould not remain unnoticed for long.\r\n\r\nHe burst into the repair bin area of the hangar and jerked his head\r\ntoward the tubes. When a ship came into the side of the mother-ship,\r\nthey entered through a large port which made it easier for the pilot of\r\nthe scout ship. But to leave the starship, one had to install the\r\nsmaller craft into one of the many blast tubes on either side of the big\r\nhangar.\r\n\r\nHe looked frantically about the area for Danson and spotted the Terran\r\nstanding unobtrusively near the pilot entry to one of the blast tubes.\r\nNick Danson, garbed in the blue and yellow of a Firstspacer, was a twin\r\nfor Lors. He hoped anxiously that none of the repairmen would notice the\r\ntrick.\r\n\r\nLors grabbed a mechanic by the arm. \"Spacer! I'm on an urgent mission.\r\nWhere can I get a ship?\"\r\n\r\nThe young spacer looked thoughtful for a moment, then pointed toward a\r\ntube on the other side of the hangar. \"In that tube, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll help you rig it,\" the spacer said.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, I'll do it myself. Go about your work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" The spacer turned away, a puzzled look on his face.\r\n\r\nLors motioned to Danson and headed toward the tube door. He could well\r\nunderstand the spacer's bewilderment. While it was possible for the\r\npilot of a scout ship to launch his own craft, it was highly impractical\r\nand not normally done. He hoped it didn't arouse their suspicions. He\r\nyanked the door open and looked over his shoulder. Danson was almost to\r\nhim, running hard. Heads turned as the mechanics watched him run.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry!\"\r\n\r\nDanson reached the door and Lors shoved him into the tube.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Brice,\" Danson demanded.\r\n\r\nLors slammed the door and whirled the wheel of the spider lock. He\r\ndidn't answer. He was too concerned with getting the door secured.\r\nThrough the port in the heavy door, he could see spacers gesturing and\r\npointing at the blast tube.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Brice!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's dead.\" Lors secured the wheel and noticed that a Vice-commander\r\nhad come into the hangar area. \"Get in the ship! Fast!\"\r\n\r\nOutside, the hanger workers were milling about like a fleet of bees.\r\nLors turned to Danson and saw him standing beside the ship, his eyes\r\nwild with disbelief.\r\n\r\n\"Get in the ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not without Brice!\"\r\n\r\nLors exploded in his native tongue. \"Get in that ship, Danson! How long\r\ndo you think it'll be before they come in the emergency door?\"\r\n\r\nNick's eyes were wide and violent. \"I'm not leaving Nolan up here,\r\ngoddammit! Get out of my way!\"\r\n\r\nLors shoved the Terran as he came in and watched him backpedal into the\r\nside of the scout ship. Danson muttered a curse and dived at the\r\nspaceman. Lors had no choice in the matter. He swung hard, Terran style,\r\nin what had come to be known as the \"ole one-two.\" His left fist dug\r\ninto Nick's stomach and, when he bent with the blow, Lors brought his\r\nright fist up from the floor and felt it smash into Danson's face. The\r\nTerran slammed backwards against the ship, his head striking the metal\r\nsides. He crumpled into an unconscious blue mound beside the ship.\r\n\r\nHe wasted no time. Casting a glance at the lifeless panel that was the\r\nemergency door at the far end of the blast tube, he grabbed Danson under\r\nthe arms and hauled him up the short ladder to the cockpit of the ship.\r\nIf they came through that emergency door, he was finished. He could not\r\npush the button in the wall that would open the huge port in the side of\r\nthe starship.\r\n\r\nThey would die if he did!\r\n\r\nIt would be one thing, to free an alien, but to intentionally kill\r\nmembers of his own race would mean disaster. Thirty seconds after he\r\npushed the wall button, would open the port at the end of the tube and\r\nsend the void of space rushing into the chamber. Anyone who did not have\r\nadequate pressurization would be a fond memory.\r\n\r\nHe stuffed Danson's body into the cockpit seat and buckled the strap\r\nabout him. Lors left the cockpit canopy open and leaped to the floor of\r\nthe tube. How long do I have? A minute? Two? Keep them outside, he\r\npleaded, and dived for the button.\r\n\r\n\"Lors!\"\r\n\r\nThe shout echoed hollowly in the tube. He glanced toward the door and\r\nsaw three mechanics inside the tube. Thunder and lightning! One second\r\nafter he had slammed the button and all the doors would have locked\r\nautomatically and the port would have opened.\r\n\r\nPanicked by the sight of them, he whipped out his pistol and fired. In\r\nthe tube, the weapon sounded like a firecracker going off in a steel\r\ndrum. The unarmed mechanics stopped dead, whirled and ducked back\r\nthrough the door. In another four seconds, the armed guards would show\r\nup.\r\n\r\nLors shoved the weapon back into the holster and slammed his hand\r\nagainst the button. It would lock them out now! He had his thirty\r\nseconds now. He dived for the ship, dropped into the cockpit and slammed\r\nthe canopy forward, twisting the lock into place.\r\n\r\nHis fingers moved over the controls and the engines whined into life as\r\nthe port opened before him. He was on his way! He revved the engines\r\nimpatiently as the big door rolled away and the stars burned in at him.\r\nThen he shoved the speed control forward and the scout ship surged out\r\ninto the blackness of space. His feet kicked at the pedals and his hands\r\nworked the stick. The scout ship rolled over and streaked toward the\r\nlighted ball of the earth.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head, looking over his shoulder at the mother-ship. Tiny\r\nflashes of brilliant light speared from the starship. They lifted,\r\nfluttered and followed him like a swarm of bees.\r\n\r\nThey were giving chase!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had thought there would be a pursuit. He kicked at the rudder pedals\r\nand threw the stick; the scout ship rolled over and plunged toward the\r\nice cap at the north pole of the planet. At 16,000 m.p.h., the rocket\r\nwas little more than a guided missile and he knew that when he reached\r\nthe ice cap, he'd have to throttle back - but then so would his\r\npursuers.\r\n\r\nBeside him, on the seat, Nick Danson's head rolled from side to side as\r\nthe ship streaked toward the earth. The four scout ships were fanned out\r\nbehind him and trying to close, yet he was holding them at bay with a\r\nmere 16,500 m.p.h. He wished frantically that he could have figured out\r\na way to stymie the chase, but starships were not built to be sabotaged.\r\nThe designers had done a damned good job on them, fitting them with\r\nevery device known to prevent crippling, or damaging by the enemy,\r\nwhoever it may be.\r\n\r\nThe four ships were hanging on him.\r\n\r\nI've got to lose them, he thought feverishly. I've got to lose them long\r\nenough to get Danson back to the cabin and get the hell out again. After\r\nthat, they can have me. But not now. He looked behind him, trying to\r\ndetermine whether or not they were getting set to fire on him.\r\n\r\nThey didn't look it, but he couldn't tell. Weapons were not a scout\r\nship's strong point. Each ship was armed with a large rocket launcher,\r\nbut it was seldom used. Speed was the greatest weapon they needed and\r\nthe military designers of the home planet had poured all their energy\r\ninto the fast maneuvering of the craft.\r\n\r\nThe heavy caps of ice that covered the continent of Greenland loomed up\r\nbefore him and he hoped that he could lose them in the white wilderness.\r\nHe would have to throttle back when he reached the jagged waste of ice,\r\nbut then so would the four behind him. They saw what he was attempting,\r\nand poured all the power they could into their ships.\r\n\r\nLors flattened the ship out in a shallow dive and pushed the throttle\r\ncontrol until it stopped. The needle on the airspeed indicator leaped\r\nviolently. 24,000 m.p.h. The ice rose against the windshield swiftly.\r\nOne of the scout ships closed and fired a rocket.\r\n\r\nHe kicked at the rudder pedal and threw the ship to the left. The scout\r\nship responded like a nervous horse and fluttered away as the rocket\r\nburned and arced beneath the underbelly.\r\n\r\nHe pulled the throttle control back, cutting the speed of the ship and\r\nshoving on the rudder as he hauled at the stick. The maneuver was too\r\nfast for the ships behind him. They tore past him in silver flashes,\r\ntrying to correct their error. He streaked off toward the Azores\r\nIslands, slicing into the atmosphere viciously, while he watched the\r\nother ships whirling off to come back at him. They would soon have to\r\nbreak radio silence, or they would never get him. It was almost\r\nimpossible to close on a quarry at these speeds, unless each man knew\r\nwhat his buddy was doing.\r\n\r\nAt 15,000 miles per hour, a micro-second of delay before acting, could\r\nslam two ships together with a violence that would atomize everything.\r\nStill they refused to make radio contact with each other.\r\n\r\nLors watched them coming back at him, minute silver specks on the radar\r\nsweep. He shoved the stick forward and dived for the ocean in a shallow\r\nplunge. He had the biggest advantage, in that they had to anticipate\r\n_his_ moves, in order to get him into their sights. One of them got him\r\nin his sights and fired.\r\n\r\nHe watched the rocket spearing toward his ship and slammed the stick\r\nover to the right. The discus-like scout ship flipped over in a slow\r\nroll, the rocket barely missing the ship. Lors felt a little sick. He\r\neased the throttle back, flattening the ship out not fifty feet above\r\nthe water of the Atlantic Ocean. Then he shoved the throttle to the wall\r\nand raced north.\r\n\r\nThe Scout ship speed indicator swung crazily and stopped at 24,500\r\nm.p.h. Behind him, the other four were firewalling their throttles just\r\nto keep within range. They couldn't possibly fire at him, because going\r\naway at speeds like they were using, he could outrun any rocket made.\r\nNot only was that in his favor, but should one of them fire, they would\r\nfly into their own weapon.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at Danson. Nick had awakened and was staring wide eyed at the\r\nocean that was spinning past them as they streaked north. Then Nick's\r\nmouth opened and Lors looked ahead. They were almost on the freighter!\r\n\r\nLors lifted the ship and whipped over the spars of the ship in a rush\r\nthat had probably broken lines and smashed windows all over the vessel.\r\nBehind him, the others were streaking over the ship and Lors could\r\nimagine the terrified crew-members who had probably been knocked flat\r\nby the wash from the scout ships.\r\n\r\nDanson had fainted.\r\n\r\nAhead of him was a heavy cloud cover. He streaked for it, with his four\r\nbuddies in hot pursuit. He hit the cloud cover and began dodging\r\nrecklessly through it, changing his course constantly to throw his\r\npursuers off. He burst out on the far side of the bank of clouds and\r\ncouldn't see the other four ships. He streaked for the cabin in the\r\nmountain country of Pennsylvania, with Danson still out.\r\n\r\nLors throttled back and hovered over the cabin. It was deserted. In the\r\nsunlight, it looked like a child's toy house in a miniature clearing. He\r\nsettled the ship in another small clearing, in the woods beyond the\r\nhouse and shut off the engines. He threw back the canopy and removed the\r\nbelt from around Danson.\r\n\r\nHe slung the Terran over his shoulder and headed for the cabin. Still\r\nnothing moved about the place. Lors breathed a sigh of relief. All he\r\nhad to do now, was dump Danson and get out. Nick could tell his wife\r\neverything and get things straightened out. Brice could be reported as\r\nmissing in the woods and the wrecked scout ship could be covered up by\r\nthe men in Washington.\r\n\r\nHe eased his way into the house and flopped Danson's unconscious body on\r\nthe couch. He had started to pull off Danson's borrowed uniform when he\r\nheard the footstep. He whirled about!\r\n\r\nBeth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nShe stood there for a moment and stared at the two of them, and he could\r\nsee from her face that she was not sure which one was her husband. Lors\r\ncame to his feet and looked at her, not quite sure what to say or do.\r\n\r\n\"Beth...\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't explain, Lors,\" she told him. Her voice was as calm and as\r\nunruffled as though she found men from outer space in the cabin every\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n\"I brought him back,\" Lors began and felt silly. He wondered vaguely how\r\nshe had known about him and his being a spaceman.\r\n\r\nShe came into the room and up to where he stood, her eyes boring into\r\nhis. \"Why did you bring him back? You could have come back by yourself\r\nand continued the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe realization of her words dawned upon him slowly and he blinked. \"You\r\n_know_ about me? How...\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you later. Why did you bring him back?\"\r\n\r\n\"You want him, don't you? It couldn't work out. Any fool can see that.\"\r\nHe reached out and gripped her shoulders firmly. \"It wasn't supposed to\r\nhappen this way, Beth. It was all supposed to go like clockwork; we\r\nnever figured on the scout ship being wrecked, and I never figured on\r\nfalling in love with you...\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why you brought him back? Because you love me?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded, trying vainly to brush aside the trembling emotion that\r\nlifted within him at the touch of her flesh. It was a weird feeling.\r\n\r\n\"I thought about taking his place, Beth. I thought about it - but I knew\r\nit wouldn't work. It was a half crazy thing in the beginning. I ... I'm\r\nsorry.\"\r\n\r\nA faint smile tugged at her lips. \"Don't be. I'm not the least bit\r\nsorry, but I'm glad I know the truth. Now it doesn't seem so ridiculous\r\n- Brice disappearing into thin air.\" She looked about the room. \"Where\r\nis he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\" Her eyes widened.\r\n\r\nLors nodded. \"I brought your husband back against my Commander's orders.\r\nWhen I tried to get Brice out of the hospital, he went berserk and began\r\nshooting things up. One of the spacers killed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Nolan,\" she whispered and he could see the tears welling in her\r\neyes. Then she looked at him sharply. \"You acted against orders?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded again.\r\n\r\n\"What will happen to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. It'll all come out all right. But, Beth, how did you know? Who\r\ntold you about this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\nLors whirled about, his eyes swinging against those of the husky blond\r\nin the dress suit who stood in the doorway of the cabin. Automatically,\r\nhis hand dropped toward the pistol at his side, but the blond stopped\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Don't bother with that, Lors,\" he grinned. \"I'm not about to draw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you,\" Lors demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Here, I'm Cartwell, of the Secret Service. But actually I'm\r\nFirstspacer Nesso of the 6th. Terran Command.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told her?\" Lors asked, amazed.\r\n\r\nThe blond nodded. \"I had to. I came here to check on Brice and found her\r\nready to call the police because first Nolan had disappeared and then\r\nyou had. I had to think of something to keep her quiet, and the only\r\nthing I could think of was the truth. I'm a lousy agent,\" he added\r\ngrinning.\r\n\r\nLors nodded and bit his lower lip. \"How do things stand now?\" He asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not too bad,\" Cartwell told him. \"I've made arrangements to have the\r\nwrecked ship hauled out of the area for study. This will be hush-hush\r\nfor awhile, then left to dissolve of itself. Everyone will forget it...\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Brice?\"\r\n\r\nCartwell pursed his lips. \"That was a rough break, but unavoidable. We\r\ncan cover up by saying that he was searching the wooded area with the\r\nrescue squads and apparently became lost. After searching and finding\r\nnothing, we can let the people draw their own conclusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Risky,\" Lors told him.\r\n\r\n\"It'll work, unless you have a better idea.\"\r\n\r\nLors shook his head. \"You can handle things down here, Cartwell. I have\r\nmy own problems up there.\" He pointed at the ceiling to indicate the\r\nstarship. \"And I'd better get Danson's uniform off and move.\"\r\n\r\nBeth caught has arm. \"Let him keep it, Lors. It won't get into the wrong\r\nhands. I promise.\"\r\n\r\nLors looked at Cartwell, who nodded. \"Let them have it,\" he said.\r\n\"They're on our side anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\" He paused. \"I'll be going...\"\r\n\r\nBeth linked her arm in his. \"I'd like to walk to the ship with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like that.\"\r\n\r\nHe grinned at Cartwell and led her outside into the afternoon sunlight.\r\nThey didn't speak until they reached the small clearing where the scout\r\nship waited for them. Then Beth pulled his head down and kissed him.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Lors,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"I'll come back, Beth, I'll come back. One of these days both our people\r\nwill be friends and we'll meet again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so.\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced up at the sky and saw two of the scout ships flashing about,\r\nhigh above the clouds. \"My escort,\" he told her grinning.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have trouble...\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her lightly on the mouth. \"No. I'll marry the Commander's\r\ndaughter and it'll all be okay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" He caught the sudden flash of womanly hurt rise in her eyes and\r\nsmiled. \"Almost as beautiful as you.\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her lightly again and leaped to the cockpit of the scout ship.\r\nHe motioned her away from the blast area and eased the ship up above the\r\ntrees. She waved to him and looked very small among the trees. He lifted\r\na hand to her, then swung the ship upward, slamming the throttle forward\r\nto head back to the starship.\r\n\r\nAnd Jela.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Transcriber's note: Punctuation preserved as originally printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Sex Life of the Gods, by Michael Knerr",
