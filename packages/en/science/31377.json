When I went to live in H---- for a time the whole town was\r\nfull of talk about him, as he happened to be just then in the midst of\r\none of the very craziest of his schemes. Krespel had the reputation\r\nof being both a clever, learn lawyer and a skilful diplomatist. One of\r\nthe reigning princes of Germany--not, however, one of the most\r\npowerful--had appealed to him for assistance in drawing up a memorial,\r\nwhich he was desirous of presenting at the Imperial Court with the view\r\nof furthering his legitimate claims upon a certain strip of territory.\r\nThe project was crowned with the happiest success; and as Krespel had\r\nonce complained that he could never find a dwelling sufficiently\r\ncomfortable to suit him, the prince, to reward him for the memorial,\r\nundertook to defray the cost of building a house which Krespel might\r\nerect just as he pleased. Moreover, the prince was willing to purchase\r\nany site that he should fancy. This offer, however, the Councillor\r\nwould not accept; he insisted that the house should be built in his\r\ngarden, situated in a very beautiful neighbourhood outside the\r\ntown-walls. So he bought all kinds of materials and had them carted\r\nout. Then he might have been seen day after day, attired in his curious\r\ngarments (which he had made himself according to certain fixed rules of\r\nhis own), slacking the lime, riddling the sand, packing up the bricks\r\nand stones in regular heaps, and so on. All this he did without once\r\nconsulting an architect or thinking about a plan. One fine day,\r\nhowever, he went to an experienced builder of the town and requested\r\nhim to be in his garden at daybreak the next morning, with all his\r\njourneymen and apprentices, and a large body of labourers, &c., to\r\nbuild him his house. Naturally the builder asked for the architect's\r\nplan, and was not a little astonished when Krespel replied that none\r\nwas needed, and that things would turn out all right in the end, just\r\nas he wanted them. Next morning, when the builder and his men came to\r\nthe place, they found a trench drawn out in the shape of an exact\r\nsquare; and Krespel said, \"Here's where you must lay the foundations;\r\nthen carry up the walls until I say they are high enough.\" \"Without\r\nwindows and doors, and without partition walls?\" broke in the builder,\r\nas if alarmed at Krespel's mad folly. \"Do what I tell you, my dear\r\nsir,\" replied the Councillor quite calmly; \"leave the rest to me; it\r\nwill be all right.\" It was only the promise of high pay that could\r\ninduce the builder to proceed with the ridiculous building; but none\r\nhas ever been erected under merrier circumstances. As there was an\r\nabundant supply of food and drink, the workmen never left their work;\r\nand amidst their continuous laughter the four walls were run up with\r\nincredible quickness, until one day Krespel cried, \"Stop!\" Then the\r\nworkmen, laying down trowel and hammer, came down from the scaffoldings\r\nand gathered round Krespel in a circle, whilst every laughing face was\r\nasking, \"Well, and what now?\" \"Make way!\" cried Krespel; and then\r\nrunning to one end of the garden, he strode slowly towards the square\r\nof brick-work. When he came close to the wall he shook his head in a\r\ndissatisfied manner, ran to the other end of the garden, again strode\r\nslowly towards the brick-work square, and proceeded to act as before.\r\nThese tactics he pursued several times, until at length, running his\r\nsharp nose hard against the wall, he cried, \"Come here, come here, men!\r\nbreak me a door in here! Here's where I want a door made!\" He gave the\r\nexact dimensions in feet and inches, and they did as he bid them. Then\r\nhe stepped inside the structure, and smiled with satisfaction as the\r\nbuilder remarked that the walls were just the height of a good\r\ntwo-storeyed house. Krespel walked thoughtfully backwards and forwards\r\nacross the space within, the bricklayers behind him with hammers and\r\npicks, and wherever he cried, \"Make a window here, six feet high by\r\nfour feet broad!\" \"There a little window, three feet by two!\" a hole\r\nwas made in a trice.\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage of the proceedings that I came to H----; and it\r\nwas highly amusing to see how hundreds of people stood round about the\r\ngarden and raised a loud shout whenever the stones flew out and a new\r\nwindow appeared where nobody had for a moment expected it. And in the\r\nsame manner Krespel proceeded with the buildings and fittings of the\r\nrest of the house, and with all the work necessary to that end;\r\neverything had to be done on the spot in accordance with the\r\ninstructions which the Councillor gave from time to time. However, the\r\nabsurdity of the whole business, the growing conviction that things\r\nwould in the end turn out better than might have been expected, but\r\nabove all, Krespel's generosity--which indeed cost him nothing--kept\r\nthem all in good-humour. Thus were the difficulties overcome which\r\nnecessarily arose out of this eccentric way of building, and in a short\r\ntime there was a completely finished house, its outside, indeed,\r\npresenting a most extraordinary appearance, no two windows, &c., being\r\nalike, but on the other hand the interior arrangements suggested a\r\npeculiar feeling of comfort. All who entered the house bore witness to\r\nthe truth of this; and I too experienced it myself when I was taken in\r\nby Krespel after I had become more intimate with him. For hitherto I\r\nhad not exchanged a word with this eccentric man; his building had\r\noccupied him so much that he had not even once been to Professor\r\nM----'s to dinner, as he was in the habit of going on Tuesdays. Indeed,\r\nin reply to a special invitation, he sent word that he should not set\r\nfoot over the threshold before the house-warming of his new building\r\ntook place. All his friends and acquaintances, therefore, confidently\r\nlooked forward to a great banquet; but Krespel invited nobody except\r\nthe masters, journeymen, apprentices, and labourers who had built the\r\nhouse. He entertained them with the choicest viands: bricklayer's\r\napprentices devoured partridge pies regardless of consequences; young\r\njoiners polished off roast pheasants with the greatest success; whilst\r\nhungry labourers helped themselves for once to the choicest morsels of\r\n_truffes fricassées_. In the evening their wives and daughters came,\r\nand there was a great ball. After waltzing a short while with the wives\r\nof the masters, Krespel sat down amongst the town-musicians, took a\r\nviolin in his hand, and directed the orchestra until daylight.\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday after this festival, which exhibited Councillor Krespel\r\nin the character of a friend of the people, I at length saw him appear,\r\nto my no little joy, at Professor M----'s. Anything more strange and\r\nfantastic than Krespel's behaviour it would be impossible to find. He\r\nwas so stiff and awkward in his movements, that he looked every moment\r\nas if he would run up against something or do some damage. But he did\r\nnot; and the lady of the house seemed to be well aware that he would\r\nnot, for she did not grow a shade paler when he rushed with heavy steps\r\nround a table crowded with beautiful cups, or when he man[oe]uvred near\r\na large mirror that reached down to the floor, or even when he seized a\r\nflower-pot of beautifully painted porcelain and swung it round in the\r\nair as if desirous of making its colours play. Moreover, before dinner\r\nhe subjected everything in the Professor's room to a most minute\r\nexamination; he also took down a picture from the wall and hung it up\r\nagain, standing on one of the cushioned chairs to do so. At the same\r\ntime he talked a good deal and vehemently; at one time his thoughts\r\nkept leaping, as it were, from one subject to another (this was most\r\nconspicuous during dinner); at another, he was unable to have done with\r\nan idea; seizing upon it again and again, he gave it all sorts of\r\nwonderful twists and turns, and couldn't get back into the ordinary\r\ntrack until something else took hold of his fancy. Sometimes his voice\r\nwas rough and harsh and screeching, and sometimes it was low and\r\ndrawling and singing; but at no time did it harmonize with what he was\r\ntalking about. Music was the subject of conversation; the praises of a\r\nnew composer were being sung, when Krespel, smiling, said in his low\r\nsinging tones, \"I wish the devil with his pitchfork would hurl that\r\natrocious garbler of music millions of fathoms down to the bottomless\r\npit of hell!\" Then he burst out passionately and wildly, \"She is an\r\nangel of heaven, nothing but pure God-given music!--the paragon and\r\nqueen of song!\"--and tears stood in his eyes. To understand this, we\r\nhad to go back to a celebrated _artiste_, who had been the subject of\r\nconversation an hour before.\r\n\r\nJust at this time a roast hare was on the table; I noticed that Krespel\r\ncarefully removed every particle of meat from the bones on his plate,\r\nand was most particular in his inquiries after the hare's feet; these\r\nthe Professor's little five-year-old daughter now brought to him with a\r\nvery pretty smile. Besides, the children had cast many friendly glances\r\ntowards Krespel during dinner; now they rose and drew nearer to him,\r\nbut not without signs of timorous awe. What's the meaning of that?\r\nthought I to myself. Dessert was brought in; then the Councillor took a\r\nlittle box from his pocket, in which he had a miniature lathe of steel.\r\nThis he immediately screwed fast to the table, and turning the bones\r\nwith incredible skill and rapidity, he made all sorts of little fancy\r\nboxes and balls, which the children received with cries of delight.\r\nJust as we were rising from table, the Professor's niece asked, \"And\r\nwhat is our Antonia doing?\" Krespel's face was like that of one who has\r\nbitten of a sour orange and wants to look as if it were a sweet one;\r\nbut this expression soon changed into the likeness of a hideous mask,\r\nwhilst he laughed behind it with downright bitter, fierce, and as it\r\nseemed to me, satanic scorn. \"Our Antonia? our dear Antonia?\" he asked\r\nin his drawling, disagreeable singing way. The Professor hastened to\r\nintervene; in the reproving glance which he gave his niece I read that\r\nshe had touched a point likely to stir up unpleasant memories in\r\nKrespel's heart. \"How are you getting on with your violins?\" interposed\r\nthe Professor in a jovial manner, taking the Councillor by both hands.\r\nThen Krespel's countenance cleared up, and with a firm voice he\r\nreplied, \"Capitally, Professor; you recollect my telling you of the\r\nlucky chance which threw that splendid Amati[1] into my hands. Well,\r\nI've only cut it open to-day--not before to-day. I hope Antonia has\r\ncarefully taken the rest of it to pieces.\" \"Antonia is a good child,\"\r\nremarked the Professor. \"Yes, indeed, that she is,\" cried the\r\nCouncillor, whisking himself round; then, seizing his hat and stick, he\r\nhastily rushed out of the room. I saw in the mirror how that tears were\r\nstanding in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Councillor was gone, I at once urged the Professor to\r\nexplain to me what Krespel had to do with violins, and particularly\r\nwith Antonia. \"Well,\" replied the Professor, \"not only is the\r\nCouncillor a remarkably eccentric fellow altogether, but he practises\r\nviolin-making in his own crack-brained way.\" \"Violin-making!\" I\r\nexclaimed, perfectly astonished. \"Yes,\" continued the Professor,\r\n\"according to the judgment of men who understand the thing, Krespel\r\nmakes the very best violins that can be found nowadays; formerly he\r\nwould frequently let other people play on those in which he had been\r\nespecially successful, but that's been all over and done with now for a\r\nlong time. As soon as he has finished a violin he plays on it himself\r\nfor one or two hours, with very remarkable power and with the most\r\nexquisite expression, then he hangs it up beside the rest, and never\r\ntouches it again or suffers anybody else to touch it. If a violin by\r\nany of the eminent old masters is hunted up anywhere, the Councillor\r\nbuys it immediately, no matter what the price put upon it. But he plays\r\nit as he does his own violins, only once; then he takes it to pieces in\r\norder to examine closely its inner structure, and should he fancy he\r\nhasn't found exactly what he sought for, he in a pet throws the pieces\r\ninto a big chest, which is already full of the remains of broken\r\nviolins.\" \"But who and what is Antonia?\" I inquired, hastily and\r\nimpetuously. \"Well, now, that,\" continued the Professor, \"that is a\r\nthing which might very well make me conceive an unconquerable aversion\r\nto the Councillor, were I not convinced that there is some peculiar\r\nsecret behind it, for he is such a good-natured fellow at bottom as to\r\nbe sometimes guilty of weakness. When he came to H---- several years\r\nago, he led the life of an anchorite, along with an old housekeeper, in\r\n---- Street. Soon, by his oddities, he excited the curiosity of his\r\nneighbours; and immediately he became aware of this, he sought and made\r\nacquaintances. Not only in my house but everywhere we became so\r\naccustomed to him that he grew to be indispensable. In spite of his\r\nrude exterior, even the children liked him, without ever proving a\r\nnuisance to him; for notwithstanding all their friendly passages\r\ntogether, they always retained a certain timorous awe of him, which\r\nsecured him against all over-familiarity. You have to-day had an\r\nexample of the way in which he wins their hearts by his ready skill in\r\nvarious things. We all took him at first for a crusty old bachelor, and\r\nhe never contradicted us. After he had been living here some time, he\r\nwent away, nobody knew where, and returned at the end of some months.\r\nThe evening following his return his windows were lit up to an unusual\r\nextent! this alone was sufficient to arouse his neighbours' attention,\r\nand they soon heard the surpassingly beautiful voice of a female\r\nsinging to the accompaniment of a piano. Then the music of a violin was\r\nheard chiming in and entering upon a keen ardent contest with the\r\nvoice. They knew at once that the player was the Councillor. I myself\r\nmixed in the large crowd which had gathered in front of his house to\r\nlisten to this extraordinary concert; and I must confess that, beside\r\nthis voice and the peculiar, deep, soul-stirring impression which the\r\nexecution made upon me, the singing of the most celebrated _artistes_\r\nwhom I had ever heard seemed to me feeble and void of expression. Until\r\nthen I had had no conception of such long-sustained notes, of such\r\nnightingale trills, of such undulations of musical sound, of such\r\nswelling up to the strength of organ-notes, of such dying away to the\r\nfaintest whisper. There was not one whom the sweet witchery did not\r\nenthral; and when the singer ceased, nothing but soft sighs broke the\r\nimpressive silence. Somewhere about midnight the Councillor was heard\r\ntalking violently, and another male voice seemed, to judge from the\r\ntones, to be reproaching him, whilst at intervals the broken words of a\r\nsobbing girl could be detected. The Councillor continued to shout with\r\nincreasing violence, until he fell into that drawling, singing way that\r\nyou know. He was interrupted by a loud scream from the girl, and then\r\nall was as still as death. Suddenly a loud racket was heard on the\r\nstairs; a young man rushed out sobbing, threw himself into a\r\npost-chaise which stood below, and drove rapidly away. The next day the\r\nCouncillor was very cheerful, and nobody had the courage to question\r\nhim about the events of the previous night. But on inquiring of the\r\nhousekeeper, we gathered that the Councillor had brought home with him\r\nan extraordinarily pretty young lady whom he called Antonia, and she it\r\nwas who had sung so beautifully. A young man also had come along with\r\nthem; he had treated Antonia very tenderly, and must evidently have\r\nbeen her betrothed. But he, since the Councillor peremptorily insisted\r\non it, had had to go away again in a hurry. What the relations between\r\nAntonia and the Councillor are has remained until now a secret, but\r\nthis much is certain, that he tyrannises over the poor girl in the most\r\nhateful fashion. He watches her as Doctor Bartholo watches his ward in\r\nthe _Barber of Seville_; she hardly dare show herself at the window;\r\nand if, yielding now and again to her earnest entreaties, he takes her\r\ninto society, he follows her with Argus' eyes, and will on no account\r\nsuffer a musical note to be sounded, far less let Antonia sing--indeed,\r\nshe is not permitted to sing in his own house. Antonia's singing on\r\nthat memorable night, has, therefore, come to be regarded by the\r\ntownspeople in the light of a tradition of some marvellous wonder that\r\nsuffices to stir the heart and the fancy; and even those who did not\r\nhear it often exclaim, whenever any other singer attempts to display\r\nher powers in the place, 'What sort of a wretched squeaking do you call\r\nthat? Nobody but Antonia knows how to sing.'\"\r\n\r\nHaving a singular weakness for such like fantastic histories, I found\r\nit necessary, as may easily be imagined, to make Antonia's\r\nacquaintance. I had myself often enough heard the popular sayings about\r\nher singing, but had never imagined that that exquisite _artiste_ was\r\nliving in the place, held a captive in the bonds of this eccentric\r\nKrespel like the victim of a tyrannous sorcerer. Naturally enough I\r\nheard in my dreams on the following night Antonia's marvellous voice,\r\nand as she besought me in the most touching manner in a glorious\r\n_adagio_ movement (very ridiculously it seemed to me, as if I had\r\ncomposed it myself) to save her, I soon resolved, like a second\r\nAstolpho,[2] to penetrate into Krespel's house, as if into another\r\nAlcina's magic castle, and deliver the queen of song from her\r\nignominious fetters.\r\n\r\nIt all came about in a different way from what I had expected; I had\r\nseen the Councillor scarcely more than two or three times, and eagerly\r\ndiscussed with him the best method of constructing violins, when he\r\ninvited me to call and see him. I did so; and he showed me his\r\ntreasures of violins. There were fully thirty of them hanging up in a\r\ncloset; one amongst them bore conspicuously all the marks of great\r\nantiquity (a carved lion's head, &c.), and, hung up higher than the\r\nrest and surmounted by a crown of flowers, it seemed to exercise a\r\nqueenly supremacy over them. \"This violin,\" said Krespel, on my making\r\nsome inquiry relative to it, \"this violin is a very remarkable and\r\ncurious specimen of the work of some unknown master, probably of\r\nTartini's[3] age. I am perfectly convinced that there is something\r\nespecially exceptional in its inner construction, and that, if I took\r\nit to pieces, a secret would be revealed to me which I have long been\r\nseeking to discover, but--laugh at me if you like--this senseless thing\r\nwhich only gives signs of life and sound as I make it, often speaks to\r\nme in a strange way of itself. The first time I played upon it I\r\nsomehow fancied that I was only the magnetiser who has the power of\r\nmoving his subject to reveal of his own accord in words the visions of\r\nhis inner nature. Don't go away with the belief that I am such a fool\r\nas to attach even the slightest importance to such fantastic notions,\r\nand yet it's certainly strange that I could never prevail upon myself\r\nto cut open that dumb lifeless thing there. I am very pleased now that\r\nI have not cut it open, for since Antonia has been with me I sometimes\r\nplay to her upon this violin. For Antonia is fond of it--very fond of\r\nit.\" As the Councillor uttered these words with visible signs of\r\nemotion, I felt encouraged to hazard the question, \"Will you not play\r\nit to me, Councillor.\" Krespel made a wry face, and falling into his\r\ndrawling, singing way, said, \"No, my good sir!\" and that was an end of\r\nthe matter. Then I had to look at all sorts of rare curiosities, the\r\ngreater part of them childish trifles; at last thrusting his arm into a\r\nchest, he brought out a folded piece of paper, which he pressed into my\r\nhand, adding solemnly, \"You are a lover of art; take this present as a\r\npriceless memento, which you must value at all times above everything\r\nelse.\" Therewith he took me by the shoulders and gently pushed me\r\ntowards the door, embracing me on the threshold. That is to say, I was\r\nin a symbolical manner virtually kicked out of doors. Unfolding the\r\npaper, I found a piece of a first string of a violin about an eighth of\r\nan inch in length, with the words, \"A piece of the treble string with\r\nwhich the deceased Staraitz[4] strung his violin for the last concert\r\nat which he ever played.\"\r\n\r\nThis summary dismissal at mention of Antonia's name led me to infer\r\nthat I should never see her; but I was mistaken, for on my second visit\r\nto the Councillor's I found her in his room, assisting him to put a\r\nviolin together. At first sight Antonia did not make a strong\r\nimpression; but soon I found it impossible to tear myself away from her\r\nblue eyes, her sweet rosy lips, her uncommonly graceful, lovely form.\r\nShe was very pale; but a shrewd remark or a merry sally would call up a\r\nwinning smile on her face and suffuse her cheeks with a deep burning\r\nflush, which, however, soon faded away to a faint rosy glow. My\r\nconversation with her was quite unconstrained, and yet I saw nothing\r\nwhatever of the Argus-like watchings on Krespel's part which the\r\nProfessor had imputed to him; on the contrary, his behaviour moved\r\nalong the customary lines, nay, he even seemed to approve of my\r\nconversation with Antonia. So I often stepped in to see the Councillor;\r\nand as we became accustomed to each other's society, a singular feeling\r\nof homeliness, taking possession of our little circle of three, filled\r\nour hearts with inward happiness. I still continued to derive exquisite\r\nenjoyment from the Councillor's strange crotchets and oddities; but it\r\nwas of course Antonia's irresistible charms alone which attracted me,\r\nand led me to put up with a good deal which I should otherwise, in the\r\nframe of mind in which I then was, have impatiently shunned. For it\r\nonly too often happened that in the Councillor's characteristic\r\nextravagance there was mingled much that was dull and tiresome; and it\r\nwas in a special degree irritating to me that, as often as I turned the\r\nconversation upon music, and particularly upon singing, he was sure to\r\ninterrupt me, with that sardonic smile upon his face and those\r\nrepulsive singing tones of his, by some remark of a quite opposite\r\ntendency, very often of a commonplace character. From the great\r\ndistress which at such times Antonia's glances betrayed, I perceived\r\nthat he only did it to deprive me of a pretext for calling upon her for\r\na song. But I didn't relinquish my design. The hindrances which the\r\nCouncillor threw in my way only strengthened my resolution to overcome\r\nthem; I must hear Antonia sing if I was not to pine away in reveries\r\nand dim aspirations for want of hearing her.\r\n\r\nOne evening Krespel was in an uncommonly good humour; he had been\r\ntaking an old Cremona violin to pieces, and had discovered that the\r\nsound-post was fixed half a line more obliquely than usual--an\r\nimportant discovery! one of incalculable advantage in the practical\r\nwork of making violins! I succeeded in setting him off at full speed on\r\nhis hobby of the true art of violin-playing. Mention of the way in\r\nwhich the old masters picked up their dexterity in execution from\r\nreally great singers (which was what Krespel happened just then to be\r\nexpatiating upon), naturally paved the way for the remark that now the\r\npractice was the exact opposite of this, the vocal score erroneously\r\nfollowing the affected and abrupt transitions and rapid scaling of the\r\ninstrumentalists. \"What is more nonsensical,\" I cried, leaping from my\r\nchair, running to the piano, and opening it quickly, \"what is more\r\nnonsensical than such an execrable style as this, which, far from being\r\nmusic, is much more like the noise of peas rolling across the floor?\"\r\nAt the same time I sang several of the modern _fermatas_, which rush up\r\nand down and hum like a well-spun peg-top, striking a few villanous\r\nchords by way of accompaniment Krespel laughed outrageously and\r\nscreamed, \"Ha! ha! methinks I hear our German-Italians or our\r\nItalian-Germans struggling with an aria from Pucitta,[5] or\r\nPortogallo,[6] or some other _Maestro di capella_, or rather _schiavo\r\nd'un primo uomo_.\"[7] Now, thought I, now's the time; so turning to\r\nAntonia, I remarked, \"Antonia knows nothing of such singing as that, I\r\nbelieve?\" At the same time I struck up one of old Leonardo Leo's[8]\r\nbeautiful soul-stirring songs. Then Antonia's cheeks glowed; heavenly\r\nradiance sparkled in her eyes, which grew full of reawakened\r\ninspiration; she hastened to the piano; she opened her lips; but at\r\nthat very moment Krespel pushed her away, grasped me by the shoulders,\r\nand with a shriek that rose up to a tenor pitch, cried, \"My son--my\r\nson--my son!\" And then he immediately went on, singing very softly, and\r\ngrasping my hand with a bow that was the pink of politeness, \"In very\r\ntruth, my esteemed and honourable student-friend, in very truth it\r\nwould be a violation of the codes of social intercourse, as well as of\r\nall good manners, were I to express aloud and in a stirring way my wish\r\nthat here, on this very spot, the devil from hell would softly break\r\nyour neck with his burning claws, and so in a sense make short work of\r\nyou; but, setting that aside, you must acknowledge, my dearest friend,\r\nthat it is rapidly growing dark, and there are no lamps burning\r\nto-night so that, even though I did not kick you downstairs at once,\r\nyour darling limbs might still run a risk of suffering damage. Go home\r\nby all means; and cherish a kind remembrance of your faithful friend,\r\nif it should happen that you never,--pray, understand me,--if you\r\nshould never see him in his own house again.\" Therewith he embraced\r\nme, and, still keeping fast hold of me, turned with me slowly towards\r\nthe door, so that I could not get another single look at Antonia. Of\r\ncourse it is plain enough that in my position I couldn't thrash the\r\nCouncillor, though that is what he really deserved. The Professor\r\nenjoyed a good laugh at my expense, and assured me that I had ruined\r\nfor ever all hopes of retaining the Councillor's friendship. Antonia\r\nwas too dear to me, I might say too holy, for me to go and play the\r\npart of the languishing lover and stand gazing up at her window, or to\r\nfill the _rôle_ of the lovesick adventurer. Completely upset, I went\r\naway from H----; but, as is usual in such cases, the brilliant colours\r\nof the picture of my fancy faded, and the recollection of Antonia, as\r\nwell as of Antonia's singing (which I had never heard), often fell upon\r\nmy heart like a soft faint trembling light, comforting me.\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards I received an appointment in B----, and set out on\r\na journey to the south of Germany. The towers of M---- rose before me\r\nin the red vaporous glow of the evening; the nearer I came the more was\r\nI oppressed by an indescribable feeling of the most agonising distress;\r\nit lay upon me like a heavy burden; I could not breathe; I was obliged\r\nto get out of my carriage into the open air. But my anguish continued\r\nto increase until it became actual physical pain. Soon I seemed to hear\r\nthe strains of a solemn chorale floating in the air; the sounds\r\ncontinued to grow more distinct; I realised the fact that they were\r\nmen's voices chanting a church chorale. \"What's that? what's that?\" I\r\ncried, a burning stab darting as it were through my breast \"Don't you\r\nsee?\" replied the coachman, who was driving along beside me, \"why,\r\ndon't you see? they're burying somebody up yonder in yon churchyard.\"\r\nAnd indeed we were near the churchyard; I saw a circle of men clothed\r\nin black standing round a grave, which was on the point of being\r\nclosed. Tears started to my eyes; I somehow fancied they were burying\r\nthere all the joy and all the happiness of life. Moving on rapidly down\r\nthe hill, I was no longer able to see into the churchyard; the chorale\r\ncame to an end, and I perceived not far distant from the gate some of\r\nthe mourners returning from the funeral. The Professor, with his niece\r\non his arm, both in deep mourning, went close past me without noticing\r\nme. The young lady had her handkerchief pressed close to her eyes, and\r\nwas weeping bitterly. In the frame of mind in which I then was I could\r\nnot possibly go into the town, so I sent on my servant with the\r\ncarriage to the hotel where I usually put up, whilst I took a turn in\r\nthe familiar neighbourhood, to get rid of a mood that was possibly only\r\ndue to physical causes, such as heating on the journey, &c. On arriving\r\nat a well-known avenue, which leads to a pleasure resort, I came upon a\r\nmost extraordinary spectacle. Councillor Krespel was being conducted by\r\ntwo mourners, from whom he appeared to be endeavouring to make his\r\nescape by all sorts of strange twists and turns. As usual, he was\r\ndressed in his own curious home-made grey coat; but from his little\r\ncocked-hat, which he wore perched over one ear in military fashion, a\r\nlong narrow ribbon of black crape fluttered backwards and forwards in\r\nthe wind. Around his waist he had buckled a black sword-belt; but\r\ninstead of a sword he had stuck a long fiddle-bow into it. A creepy\r\nshudder ran through my limbs: \"He's insane,\" thought I, as I slowly\r\nfollowed them. The Councillor's companions led him as far as his house,\r\nwhere he embraced them, laughing loudly. They left him; and then\r\nhis glance fell upon me, for I now stood near him. He stared at me\r\nfixedly for some time; then he cried in a hollow voice, \"Welcome, my\r\nstudent-friend! you also understand it!\" Therewith he took me by the\r\narm and pulled me into the house, up the steps, into the room where the\r\nviolins hung. They were all draped in black crape; the violin of the\r\nold master was missing; in its place was a cypress wreath. I knew what\r\nhad happened. \"Antonia! Antonia!\" I cried in inconsolable grief. The\r\nCouncillor, with his arms crossed on his breast, stood beside me, as if\r\nturned into stone. I pointed to the cypress wreath. \"When she died,\"\r\nsaid he in a very hoarse solemn voice, \"when she died, the soundpost of\r\nthat violin broke into pieces with a ringing crack, and the sound-board\r\nwas split from end to end. The faithful instrument could only live with\r\nher and in her; it lies beside her in the coffin, it has been buried\r\nwith her.\" Deeply agitated, I sank down upon a chair, whilst the\r\nCouncillor began to sing a gay song in a husky voice; it was truly\r\nhorrible to see him hopping about on one foot, and the crape strings\r\n(he still had his hat on) flying about the room and up to the violins\r\nhanging on the walls. Indeed, I could not repress a loud cry that rose\r\nto my lips when, on the Councillor making an abrupt turn, the crape\r\ncame all over me; I fancied he wanted to envelop me in it and drag me\r\ndown into the horrible dark depths of insanity. Suddenly he stood still\r\nand addressed me in his singing way, \"My son! my son! why do you call\r\nout? Have you espied the angel of death? That always precedes the\r\nceremony.\" Stepping into the middle of the room, he took the violin-bow\r\nout of his sword-belt and, holding it over his head with both hands,\r\nbroke it into a thousand pieces. Then, with a loud laugh, he cried,\r\n\"Now you imagine my sentence is pronounced, don't you, my son? but it's\r\nnothing of the kind--not at all! not at all! Now I'm free--free--free--\r\nhurrah! I'm free! Now I shall make no more violins--no more\r\nviolins--Hurrah! no more violins!\" This he sang to a horrible mirthful\r\ntune, again spinning round on one foot. Perfectly aghast, I was making\r\nthe best of my way to the door, when he held me fast, saying quite\r\ncalmly, \"Stay, my student friend, pray don't think from this outbreak\r\nof grief, which is torturing me as if with the agonies of death, that\r\nI am insane; I only do it because a short time ago I made myself a\r\ndressing-gown in which I wanted to look like Fate or like God!\" The\r\nCouncillor then went on with a medley of silly and awful rubbish, until\r\nhe fell down utterly exhausted; I called up the old housekeeper, and\r\nwas very pleased to find myself in the open air again.\r\n\r\nI never doubted for a moment that Krespel had become insane; the\r\nProfessor, however, asserted the contrary. \"There are men,\" he\r\nremarked, \"from whom nature or a special destiny has taken away the\r\ncover behind which the mad folly of the rest of us runs its course\r\nunobserved. They are like thin-skinned insects, which, as we watch the\r\nrestless play of their muscles, seem to be misshapen, while\r\nnevertheless everything soon comes back into its proper form again. All\r\nthat with us remains thought, passes over with Krespel into action.\r\nThat bitter scorn which the spirit that is wrapped up in the doings and\r\ndealings of the earth often has at hand, Krespel gives vent to in\r\noutrageous gestures and agile caprioles. But these are his lightning\r\nconductor. What comes up out of the earth he gives again to the earth,\r\nbut what is divine, that he keeps; and so I believe that his inner\r\nconsciousness, in spite of the apparent madness which springs from it\r\nto the surface, is as right as a trivet. To be sure, Antonia's sudden\r\ndeath grieves him sore, but I warrant that tomorrow will see him going\r\nalong in his old jog-trot way as usual.\" And the Professor's prediction\r\nwas almost literally filled. Next day the Councillor appeared to be\r\njust as he formerly was, only he averred that he would never make\r\nanother violin, nor yet ever play on another. And, as I learned later,\r\nhe kept his word.\r\n\r\nHints which the Professor let fall confirmed my own private conviction\r\nthat the so carefully guarded secret of the Councillor's relations to\r\nAntonia, nay, that even her death, was a crime which must weigh heavily\r\nupon him, a crime that could not be atoned for. I determined that I\r\nwould not leave H---- without taxing him with the offence which I\r\nconceived him to be guilty of; I determined to shake his heart down to\r\nits very roots, and so compel him to make open confession of the\r\nterrible deed. The more I reflected upon the matter the clearer it grew\r\nin my own mind that Krespel must be a villain, and in the same\r\nproportion did my intended reproach, which assumed of itself the form\r\nof a real rhetorical masterpiece, wax more fiery and more impressive.\r\nThus equipped and mightily incensed, I hurried to his house. I found\r\nhim with a calm smiling countenance making playthings. \"How can peace,\"\r\nI burst out, \"how can peace find lodgment even for a single moment in\r\nyour breast, so long as the memory of your horrible deed preys like a\r\nserpent upon you?\" He gazed at me in amazement, and laid his chisel\r\naside. \"What do you mean, my dear sir?\" he asked; \"pray take a seat.\"\r\nBut my indignation chafing me more and more, I went on to accuse him\r\ndirectly of having murdered Antonia, and to threaten him with the\r\nvengeance of the Eternal.\r\n\r\nFurther, as a newly full-fledged lawyer, full of my profession, I went\r\nso far as to give him to understand that I would leave no stone\r\nunturned to get a clue to the business, and so deliver him here in this\r\nworld into the hands of an earthly judge. I must confess that I was\r\nconsiderably disconcerted when, at the conclusion of my violent and\r\npompous harangue, the Councillor, without answering so much as a\r\nsingle word, calmly fixed his eyes upon me as though expecting me\r\nto go on again. And this I did indeed attempt to do, but it sounded so\r\nill-founded and so stupid as well that I soon grew silent again.\r\nKrespel gloated over my embarrassment, whilst a malicious ironical\r\nsmile flitted across his face. Then he grew very grave, and addressed\r\nme in solemn tones. \"Young man, no doubt you think I am foolish,\r\ninsane; that I can pardon you, since we are both confined in the same\r\nmadhouse; and you only blame me for deluding myself with the idea that\r\nI am God the Father because you imagine yourself to be God the Son. But\r\nhow do you dare desire to insinuate yourself into the secrets and lay\r\nbare the hidden motives of a life that is strange to you and that must\r\ncontinue so? She has gone and the mystery is solved.\" He ceased\r\nspeaking, rose, and traversed the room backwards and forwards several\r\ntimes. I ventured to ask for an explanation; he fixed his eyes upon me,\r\ngrasped me by the hand, and led me to the window, which he threw wide\r\nopen. Propping himself upon his arms, he leaned out, and, looking down\r\ninto the garden, told me the history of his life. When he finished I\r\nleft him, touched and ashamed.\r\n\r\nIn a few words, his relations with Antonia rose in the following way.\r\nTwenty years before, the Councillor had been led into Italy by his\r\nfavourite engrossing passion of hunting up and buying the best violins\r\nof the old masters. At that time he had not yet begun to make them\r\nhimself, and so of course he had not begun to take to pieces those\r\nwhich he bought. In Venice he heard the celebrated singer Angela ----i,\r\nwho at that time was playing with splendid success as _prima donna_ at\r\nSt. Benedict's Theatre. His enthusiasm was awakened, not only in her\r\nart--which Signora Angela had indeed brought to a high pitch of\r\nperfection--but in her angelic beauty as well. He sought her\r\nacquaintance; and in spite of all his rugged manners he succeeded in\r\nwinning her heart, principally through his bold and yet at the same\r\ntime masterly violin-playing. Close intimacy led in a few weeks to\r\nmarriage, which, however, was kept a secret, because Angela was\r\nunwilling to sever her connection with the theatre, neither did she\r\nwish to part with her professional name, that by which she was\r\ncelebrated, nor to add to it the cacophonous \"Krespel.\" With the most\r\nextravagant irony he described to me what a strange life of worry and\r\ntorture Angela led him as soon as she became his wife. Krespel was of\r\nopinion that more capriciousness and waywardness were concentrated in\r\nAngela's little person than in all the rest of the _prima donnas_ in\r\nthe world put together. If he now and again presumed to stand up in his\r\nown defence, she let loose a whole army of abbots, musical composers,\r\nand students upon him, who, ignorant of his true connection with\r\nAngela, soundly rated him as a most intolerable, ungallant lover for\r\nnot submitting to all the Signora's caprices. It was just after one of\r\nthese stormy scenes that Krespel fled to Angela's country seat to try\r\nand forget in playing fantasias on his Cremona, violin the annoyances\r\nof the day. But he had not been there long before the Signora, who had\r\nfollowed hard after him, stepped into the room. She was in an\r\naffectionate humour; she embraced her husband, overwhelmed him with\r\nsweet and languishing glances, and rested her pretty head on his\r\nshoulder. But Krespel, carried away into the world of music, continued\r\nto play on until the walls echoed again; thus he chanced to touch the\r\nSignora somewhat ungently with his arm and the fiddle-bow. She leapt\r\nback full of fury, shrieking that he was a \"German brute,\" snatched the\r\nviolin from his hands, and dashed it on the marble table into a\r\nthousand pieces. Krespel stood like a statue of stone before her; but\r\nthen, as if awakening out of a dream, he seized her with the strength\r\nof a giant and threw her out of the window of her own house, and,\r\nwithout troubling himself about anything more, fled back to Venice--to\r\nGermany. It was not, however, until some time had elapsed that he had a\r\nclear recollection of what he had done; although he knew that the\r\nwindow was scarcely five feet from the ground, and although he was\r\nfully cognisant of the necessity, under the above-mentioned\r\ncircumstances, of throwing the Signora out of the window, he yet felt\r\ntroubled by a sense of painful uneasiness, and the more so since she\r\nhad imparted to him in no ambiguous terms an interesting secret as to\r\nher condition. He hardly dared to make inquiries; and he was not a\r\nlittle surprised about eight months afterwards at receiving a tender\r\nletter from his beloved wife, in which she made not the slightest\r\nallusion to what had taken place in her country house, only adding to\r\nthe intelligence that she had been safely delivered of a sweet little\r\ndaughter the heartfelt prayer that her dear husband and now a happy\r\nfather would come at once to Venice. That however Krespel did not do;\r\nrather he appealed to a confidential friend for a more circumstantial\r\naccount of the details, and learned that the Signora had alighted upon\r\nthe soft grass as lightly as a bird, and that the sole consequences of\r\nthe fall or shock had been psychic. That is to say, after Krespel's\r\nheroic deed she had become completely altered; she never showed a trace\r\nof caprice, of her former freaks, or of her teasing habits; and the\r\ncomposer who wrote for the next carnival was the happiest fellow under\r\nthe sun, since the Signora was willing to sing his music without the\r\nscores and hundreds of changes which she at other times had insisted\r\nupon. \"To be sure,\" added his friend, \"there was every reason for\r\npreserving the secret of Angela's cure, else every day would see lady\r\nsingers flying through windows.\" The Councillor was not a little\r\nexcited at this news; he engaged horses; he took his seat in the\r\ncarriage. \"Stop!\" he cried suddenly. \"Why, there's not a shadow of\r\ndoubt,\" he murmured to himself, \"that as soon as Angela sets eyes upon\r\nme again the evil spirit will recover his power and once more take\r\npossession of her. And since I have already thrown her out of the\r\nwindow, what could I do if a similar case were to occur again? What\r\nwould there be left for me to do?\" He got out of the carriage, and\r\nwrote an affectionate letter to his wife, making graceful allusion to\r\nher tenderness in especially dwelling upon the fact that his tiny\r\ndaughter had like him a little mole behind the ear, and--remained in\r\nGermany. Now ensued an active correspondence between them. Assurances\r\nof unchanged affection--invitations--laments over the absence of the\r\nbeloved one--thwarted wishes--hopes, &c.--flew backwards and forwards\r\nfrom Venice to H----, from H---- to Venice. At length Angela came to\r\nGermany, and, as is well known, sang with brilliant success as _prima\r\ndonna_ at the great theatre in F----. Despite the fact that she was no\r\nlonger young, she won all hearts by the irresistible charm of her\r\nwonderfully splendid singing. At that time she had not lost her voice\r\nin the least degree. Meanwhile, Antonia had been growing up; and her\r\nmother never tired of writing to tell her father how that a singer of\r\nthe first rank was developing in her. Krespel's friends in F---- also\r\nconfirmed this intelligence, and urged him to come for once to F---- to\r\nsee and admire this uncommon sight of two such glorious singers. They\r\nhad not the slightest suspicion of the close relations in which Krespel\r\nstood to the pair. Willingly would he have seen with his own eyes the\r\ndaughter who occupied so large a place in his heart, and who moreover\r\noften appeared to him in his dreams; but as often as he thought upon\r\nhis wife he felt very uncomfortable, and so he remained at home amongst\r\nhis broken violins. There was a certain promising young composer,\r\nB---- of F----, who was found to have suddenly disappeared, nobody knew\r\nwhere. This young man fell so deeply in love with Antonia that, as she\r\nreturned his love, he earnestly besought her mother to consent to an\r\nimmediate union, sanctified as it would further be by art. Angela had\r\nnothing to urge against his suit; and the Councillor the more readily\r\ngave his consent that the young composer's productions had found\r\nfavour before his rigorous critical judgment. Krespel was expecting\r\nto hear of the consummation of the marriage, when he received\r\ninstead a black-sealed envelope addressed in a strange hand. Doctor\r\nR---- conveyed to the Councillor the sad intelligence that Angela had\r\nfallen seriously ill in consequence of a cold caught at the theatre,\r\nand that during the night immediately preceding what was to have been\r\nAntonia's wedding-day, she had died. To him, the Doctor, Angela had\r\ndisclosed the fact that she was Krespel's wife, and that Antonia was\r\nhis daughter; he, Krespel, had better hasten therefore to take charge\r\nof the orphan. Notwithstanding that the Councillor was a good deal\r\nupset by this news of Angela's death, he soon began to feel that an\r\nantipathetic, disturbing influence had departed out of his life, and\r\nthat now for the first time he could begin to breathe freely. The very\r\nsame day he set out for F----. You could not credit how heartrending\r\nwas the Councillor's description of the moment when he first saw\r\nAntonia. Even in the fantastic oddities of his expression there was\r\nsuch a marvellous power of description that I am unable to give even so\r\nmuch as a faint indication of it. Antonia inherited all her mother's\r\namiability and all her mother's charms, but not the repellent reverse\r\nof the medal. There was no chronic moral ulcer, which might break out\r\nfrom time to time. Antonia's betrothed put in an appearance, whilst\r\nAntonia herself, fathoming with happy instinct the deeper-lying\r\ncharacter of her wonderful father, sang one of old Padre Martini's[9]\r\nmotets, which, she knew, Krespel in the heyday of his courtship had\r\nnever grown tired of hearing her mother sing. The tears ran in streams\r\ndown Krespel's cheeks; even Angela he had never heard sing like that.\r\nAntonia's voice was of a very remarkable and altogether peculiar\r\ntimbre, at one time it was like the sighing of an Æolian harp, at\r\nanother like the warbled gush of the nightingale. It seemed as if there\r\nwas not room for such notes in the human breast. Antonia, blushing with\r\njoy and happiness, sang on and on--all her most beautiful songs,\r\nB---- playing between whiles as only enthusiasm that is intoxicated\r\nwith delight can play. Krespel was at first transported with rapture,\r\nthen he grew thoughtful--still--absorbed in reflection. At length\r\nhe leapt to his feet, pressed Antonia to his heart, and begged\r\nher in a low husky voice, \"Sing no more if you love me--my heart\r\nis bursting--I fear--I fear--don't sing again.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" remarked the Councillor next day to Doctor R----, \"when, as she\r\nsang, her blushes gathered into two dark red spots on her pale cheeks,\r\nI knew it had nothing to do with your nonsensical family likenesses, I\r\nknew it was what I dreaded.\" The Doctor, whose countenance had shown\r\nsigns of deep distress from the very beginning of the conversation,\r\nreplied, \"Whether it arises from a too early taxing of her powers of\r\nsong, or whether the fault is Nature's--enough, Antonia labours under\r\nan organic failure in the chest, while it is from it too that her voice\r\nderives its wonderful power and its singular timbre, which I might\r\nalmost say transcend the limits of human capabilities of song. But it\r\nbears the announcement of her early death; for, if she continues to\r\nsing, I wouldn't give her at the most more than six months longer to\r\nlive.\" Krespel's heart was lacerated as if by the stabs of hundreds of\r\nstinging knives. It was as though his life had been for the first time\r\novershadowed by a beautiful tree full of the most magnificent blossoms,\r\nand now it was to be sawn to pieces at the roots, so that it could not\r\ngrow green and blossom any more. His resolution was taken. He told\r\nAntonia all; he put the alternatives before her--whether she would\r\nfollow her betrothed and yield to his and the world's seductions, but\r\nwith the certainty of dying early, or whether she would spread round\r\nher father in his old days that joy and peace which had hitherto been\r\nunknown to him, and so secure a long life. She threw herself sobbing\r\ninto his arms, and he, knowing the heartrending trial that was before\r\nher, did not press for a more explicit declaration. He talked the\r\nmatter over with her betrothed; but, notwithstanding that the latter\r\naverred that no note should ever cross Antonia's lips, the Councillor\r\nwas only too well aware that even B---- could not resist the temptation\r\nof hearing her sing, at any rate arias of his own composition. And the\r\nworld, the musical public, even though acquainted with the nature of\r\nthe singer's affliction, would certainly not relinquish its claims to\r\nhear her, for in cases where pleasure is concerned people of this class\r\nare very selfish and cruel. The Councillor disappeared from F---- along\r\nwith Antonia, and came to H----. B---- was in despair when he learnt\r\nthat they had gone. He set out on their track, overtook them, and\r\narrived at H---- at the same time that they did. \"Let me see him only\r\nonce, and then die!\" entreated Antonia \"Die! die!\" cried Krespel, wild\r\nwith anger, an icy shudder running through him. His daughter, the only\r\ncreature in the wide world who had awakened in him the springs of\r\nunknown joy, who alone had reconciled him to life, tore herself away\r\nfrom his heart, and he--he suffered the terrible trial to take place.\r\nB---- sat down to the piano; Antonia sang; Krespel fiddled away\r\nmerrily, until the two red spots showed themselves on Antonia's cheeks.\r\nThen he bade her stop; and as B was taking leave of his betrothed, she\r\nsuddenly fell to the floor with a loud scream. \"I thought,\" continued\r\nKrespel in his narration, \"I thought that she was, as I had\r\nanticipated, really dead; but as I had prepared myself for the worst,\r\nmy calmness did not leave me, nor my self-command desert me. I grasped\r\nB----, who stood like a silly sheep in his dismay, by the shoulders,\r\nand said (here the Councillor fell into his singing tone), 'Now that\r\nyou, my estimable pianoforte-player, have, as you wished and desired,\r\nreally murdered your betrothed, you may quietly take your departure; at\r\nleast have the goodness to make yourself scarce before I run my bright\r\nhanger through your heart. My daughter, who, as you see, is rather\r\npale, could very well do with some colour from your precious blood.\r\nMake haste and run, for I might also hurl a nimble knife or two after\r\nyou.' I must, I suppose, have looked rather formidable as I uttered\r\nthese words, for, with a cry of the greatest terror, B---- tore himself\r\nloose from my grasp, rushed out of the room, and down the steps.\"\r\nDirectly after B---- was gone, when the Councillor tried to lift up his\r\ndaughter, who lay unconscious on the floor, she opened her eyes with a\r\ndeep sigh, but soon closed them again as if about to die. Then\r\nKrespel's grief found vent aloud, and would not be comforted. The\r\nDoctor, whom the old housekeeper had called in, pronounced Antonia's\r\ncase a somewhat serious but by no means dangerous attack; and she did\r\nindeed recover more quickly than her father had dared to hope. She now\r\nclung to him with the most confiding childlike affection; she entered\r\ninto his favourite hobbies--into his mad schemes and whims. She helped\r\nhim take old violins to pieces and glue new ones together. \"I won't\r\nsing again any more, but live for you,\" she often said, sweetly smiling\r\nupon him, after she had been asked to sing and had refused. Such\r\nappeals however the Councillor was anxious to spare her as much as\r\npossible; therefore it was that he was unwilling to take her into\r\nsociety, and solicitously shunned all music. He well understood how\r\npainful it must be for her to forego altogether the exercise of that\r\nart which she had brought to such a pitch of perfection. When the\r\nCouncillor bought the wonderful violin that he had buried with Antonia,\r\nand was about to take it to pieces, she met him with such sadness in\r\nher face and softly breathed the petition, \"What! this as well?\" By\r\nsome power, which he could not explain, he felt impelled to leave this\r\nparticular instrument unbroken, and to play upon it. Scarcely had he\r\ndrawn the first few notes from it than Antonia cried aloud with joy,\r\n\"Why, that's me!--now I shall sing again.\" And, in truth, there was\r\nsomething remarkably striking about the clear, silvery, bell-like tones\r\nof the violin; they seemed to have been engendered in the human soul.\r\nKrespel's heart was deeply moved; he played, too, better than ever. As\r\nhe ran up and down the scale, playing bold passages with consummate\r\npower and expression, she clapped her hands together and cried with\r\ndelight, \"I did that well! I did that well!\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time onwards her life was filled with peace and cheerfulness.\r\nShe often said to the Councillor, \"I should like to sing something,\r\nfather.\" Then Krespel would take his violin down from the wall and play\r\nher most beautiful songs, and her heart was right glad and happy.\r\nShortly before my arrival in H----, the Councillor fancied one night\r\nthat he heard somebody playing the piano in the adjoining room, and he\r\nsoon made out distinctly that B---- was flourishing on the instrument\r\nin his usual style. He wished to get up, but felt himself held down as\r\nif by a dead weight, and lying as if fettered in iron bonds; he was\r\nutterly unable to move an inch. Then Antonia's voice was heard singing\r\nlow and soft; soon, however, it began to rise and rise in volume until\r\nit became an ear-splitting fortissimo; and at length she passed over\r\ninto a powerfully impressive song which B---- had once composed for her\r\nin the devotional style of the old masters. Krespel described his\r\ncondition as being incomprehensible, for terrible anguish was mingled\r\nwith a delight he had never experienced before. All at once he was\r\nsurrounded by a dazzling brightness, in which he beheld B---- and\r\nAntonia locked in a close embrace, and gazing at each other in a\r\nrapture of ecstasy. The music of the song and of the pianoforte\r\naccompanying it went on without any visible signs that Antonia sang or\r\nthat B---- touched the instrument. Then the Councillor fell into a sort\r\nof dead faint, whilst the images vanished away. On awakening he still\r\nfelt the terrible anguish of his dream. He rushed into Antonia's room.\r\nShe lay on the sofa, her eyes closed, a sweet angelic smile on her\r\nface, her hands devoutly folded, and looking as if asleep and dreaming\r\nof the joys and raptures of heaven. But she was--dead.\r\n\r\n                      *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO \"THE CREMONA VIOLIN\":\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Amati were a celebrated family of violin-makers of\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, belonging to Cremona in Italy.\r\nThey form the connecting-link between the Brescian school of makers and\r\nthe greatest of all makers, Straduarius and Guanerius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A reference to Ariosto's _Orlando Furioso_.

With his baton\r\nraised, he is awaiting the moment when the Signora shall end, in a long\r\ntrill, the cadence which, with her eyes directed heavenwards, she is\r\njust in the midst of; then down will come his hand, whilst the\r\nguitarist gaily dashes off the dominant chord. The abbot is filled with\r\nadmiration--with exquisite delight--and at the same time his attention\r\nis painfully on the stretch. He wouldn't miss the proper downward beat\r\nfor the world. He hardly dare breathe. He would like to stop the mouth\r\nand wings of every buzzing bee and midge. So much the more therefore is\r\nhe annoyed at the bustling host who must needs come and bring the wine\r\njust at this supreme, delicious moment. An outlook upon an avenue,\r\npatterned by brilliant strips of light! There a horseman has pulled up,\r\nand a glass of something refreshing to drink is being handed up to him\r\non horseback.\r\n\r\nBefore this picture stood the two friends Edward and Theodore. \"The\r\nmore I look at this singer,\" said Edward, \"in her gay attire, who,\r\nthough rather oldish, is yet full of the true inspiration of her art,\r\nand the more I am delighted with the grave but genuine Roman profile\r\nand lovely form of the guitarist, and the more my estimable friend the\r\nabbot amuses me, the more does the whole picture seem to me instinct\r\nwith free, strong, vital power. It is plainly a caricature in the\r\nhigher sense of the term, but rich in grace and vivacity. I should just\r\nlike to step into that arbour and open one of those dainty little\r\nflasks which are ogling me from the table. I tell you what, I fancy I\r\ncan already smell something of the sweet fragrance of the noble wine.\r\nCome, it were a sin for this solicitation to be wasted on the cold\r\nsenseless atmosphere that is about us here. Let us go and drain a flask\r\nof Italian wine in honour of this fine picture, of art, and of merry\r\nItaly, where life is exhilarating and given for pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst Edward was running on thus in disconnected sentences, Theodore\r\nstood silent and deeply absorbed in reflection. \"Ay, that we will, come\r\nalong,\" he said, starting up as if awakening out of a dream; but\r\nnevertheless he had some difficulty in tearing himself away from the\r\npicture, and as he mechanically followed his friend, he had to stop at\r\nthe door to cast another longing lingering look back upon the singer\r\nand guitarist and abbot. Edward's proposal easily admitted of being\r\ncarried into execution. They crossed the street diagonally, and very\r\nsoon a flask exactly like those in the picture stood before them in\r\nSala Tarone's[2] little blue room. \"It seems to me,\" said Edward, as\r\nTheodore still continued very silent and thoughtful, even after several\r\nglasses had been drunk, \"it seems to me that the picture has made a\r\ndeeper impression upon you than upon me, and not such an agreeable\r\nimpression either.\" \"I assure you,\" replied Theodore, \"that I lost\r\nnothing of the brightness and grace of that animated composition; yet\r\nit is very singular,--it is a faithful representation of a scene out of\r\nmy own life, reproducing the portraits of the parties concerned in it\r\nin a manner startlingly lifelike. You will, however, agree with me that\r\ndiverting memories also have the power of strangely moving the mind\r\nwhen they suddenly spring up in this extraordinary and unexpected way,\r\nas if awakened by the wave of a magician's wand. That's the case with\r\nme just now.\" \"What! a scene out of your own life!\" exclaimed Edward,\r\nquite astonished. \"Do you mean to say the picture represents an episode\r\nin your own life? I saw at once that the two ladies and the priest were\r\neminently successful portraits, but I never for a moment dreamed that\r\nyou had ever come across them in the course of your life. Come now,\r\ntell me all about it, how it all came about; we are quite alone, nobody\r\nelse will come at this time o' day.\" \"Willingly,\" answered Theodore,\r\n\"but unfortunately I must go a long way back--to my early youth in\r\nfact.\" \"Never mind; fire away,\" rejoined Edward; \"I don't know over\r\nmuch about your early days. If it lasts a good while, nothing worse\r\nwill happen than that we shall have to empty a bottle more than we at\r\nfirst bargained for; and to that nobody will have any objection,\r\nneither we, nor Mr. Tarone.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, throwing everything else aside, I at length devoted myself\r\nentirely to the noble art of music,\" began Theodore, \"need excite\r\nnobody's astonishment, for whilst still a boy I would hardly do\r\nanything else but play, and spent hours and hours strumming on my\r\nuncle's old creaking, jarring piano. The little town was very badly\r\nprovided for music; there was nobody who could give me instruction\r\nexcept an old opinionated organist; he, however, was merely a dry\r\narithmetician, and plagued me to death with obscure, unmelodious\r\ntoccatas and fugues. But I held on bravely, without letting myself be\r\ndaunted. The old fellow was crabby, and often found a good deal of\r\nfault, but he had only to play a good piece in his own powerful style,\r\nand I was at once reconciled both with him and with his art. I was then\r\noften in a curious state of mind; many pieces particularly of old\r\nSebastian Bach were almost like a fearful ghost-story, and I yielded\r\nmyself up to that feeling of pleasurable awe to which we are so prone\r\nin the days of our fantastic youth. But I entered into a veritable Eden\r\nwhen, as sometimes happened in winter, the bandmaster of the town and\r\nhis colleagues, supported by a few other moderate dilettante players,\r\ngave a concert, and I, owing to the strict time I always kept, was\r\npermitted to play the kettledrum in the symphony. It was not until\r\nlater that I perceived how ridiculous and extravagant these concerts\r\nwere. My teacher generally played two concertos on the piano by Wolff\r\nor Emanuel Bach,[3] a member of the town band struggled with\r\nStamitz,[4] while the receiver of excise duties worked away hard at the\r\nflute, and took in such an immense supply of breath that he blew out\r\nboth lights on his music-stand, and always had to have them relighted\r\nagain. Singing wasn't thought about; my uncle, a great friend and\r\npatron of music, always disparaged the local talent in this line. He\r\nstill dwelt with exuberant delight upon the days gone by, when the four\r\nchoristers of the four churches of the town agreed together to give\r\n_Lottchen am Hofe_.[5] Above all, he was wont to extol the toleration\r\nwhich united the singers in the production of this work of art, for not\r\nonly the Catholic and the Evangelical but also the Reformed community\r\nwas split into two bodies--those speaking German and those speaking\r\nFrench. The French chorister was not daunted by the _Lottchen_, but, as\r\nmy uncle maintained, sang his part, spectacles on nose, in the finest\r\nfalsetto that ever proceeded forth from a human breast. Now there was\r\namongst us (I mean in the town) a spinster named Meibel, aged about\r\nfifty-five, who subsisted upon the scanty pension which she received as\r\na retired court singer of the metropolis, and my uncle was rightly of\r\nopinion that Miss Meibel might still do something for her money in the\r\nconcert hall. She assumed airs of importance, required a good deal of\r\ncoaxing, but at last consented, so that we came to have _bravuras_ in\r\nour concerts. She was a singular creature this Miss Meibel. I still\r\nretain a lively recollection of her lean little figure. Dressed in a\r\nmany-coloured gown, she was wont to step forward with her roll of music\r\nin her hand, looking very grave and solemn, and to acknowledge the\r\naudience with a slight inclination of the upper part of her body. Her\r\nhead-dress was a most remarkable head-dress. In front was fastened a\r\nnosegay of Italian flowers of porcelain, which kept up a strange\r\ntrembling and tottering as she sang. At the end, after the audience had\r\ngreeted her with no stinted measure of applause, she proudly handed the\r\nmusic-roll to my uncle, and permitted him to dip his thumb and finger\r\ninto a little porcelain snuff-box, fashioned in the shape of a pug dog,\r\nout of which she took a pinch herself with evident relish. She had a\r\nhorrible squeaky voice, indulged in all sorts of ludicrous flourishes\r\nand roulades, and so you may imagine what an effect all this, combined\r\nwith her ridiculous manners and style of dress, could not fail to have\r\nupon me. My uncle overflowed with panegyrics; that I could not\r\nunderstand, and so turned the more readily to my organist, who, looking\r\nwith contempt upon vocal efforts in general, delighted me down to the\r\nground as in his hypochondriac malicious way he parodied the ludicrous\r\nold spinster.\r\n\r\n\"The more decidedly I came to share with my master his contempt for\r\nsinging, the higher did he rate my musical genius. He took a great and\r\nzealous interest in instructing me in counterpoint, so that I soon came\r\nto write the most ingenious toccatas and fugues. I was once playing one\r\nof these ingenious specimens of my skill to my uncle on my birthday (I\r\nwas nineteen years old), when the waiter of our first hotel stepped\r\ninto the room to announce the visit of two foreign ladies who\r\nhad just arrived in the town. Before my uncle could throw off his\r\ndressing-gown--it was of a large flower pattern--and don his coat and\r\nvest, his visitors were already in the room. You know what an electric\r\neffect every strange event has upon those who are brought up in the\r\nnarrow seclusion of a small country town; this in particular, which\r\ncrossed my path so unexpectedly, was pre-eminently fitted to work a\r\ncomplete revolution within me. Picture to yourself two tall, slender\r\nItalian ladies, dressed fantastically and in bright colours, quite up\r\nto the latest fashion, meeting my uncle with the freedom of\r\nprofessional _artistes_, and yet with considerable charms of manner,\r\nand addressing him in firm and sonorous voices. What the deuce of a\r\nstrange tongue they speak! Only now and then does it sound at all like\r\nGerman. My uncle doesn't understand a word; embarrassed, mute as a\r\nmaggot, he steps back and points to the sofa. They sit down, talk\r\ntogether--it sounds like music itself. At length they succeed in making\r\nmy good uncle comprehend that they are singers on a tour; they would\r\nlike to give a concert in the place, and have come to him, as he is the\r\nman to conduct such musical negotiations.\r\n\r\n\"Whilst they were talking together I picked up their Christian names,\r\nand I fancied that I could now more easily and more distinctly\r\ndistinguish the one from the other, for their both making their\r\nappearance together had at first confused me. Lauretta, apparently the\r\nelder of the two, looked about her with sparkling eyes, and talked away\r\nat my embarrassed old uncle with gushing vivacity and with\r\ndemonstrative gestures. She was not too tall, and of a voluptuous\r\nbuild, so that my eyes wandered amid many charms that hitherto had been\r\nstrangers to them. Teresina, taller, more slender, with a long grave\r\nface, spoke but seldom, but what she did say was more intelligible. Now\r\nand then a peculiar smile flitted across her features; it almost seemed\r\nas if she were highly amused at my good uncle, who had withdrawn into\r\nhis silken dressing-gown like a snail into its shell, and was vainly\r\nendeavouring to push out of sight a treacherous yellow string, with\r\nwhich he fastened his night-jacket together, and which would keep\r\ntumbling out of his bosom yards and yards long. At length they rose to\r\ndepart; my uncle promised to arrange everything for the concert for the\r\nthird day following; then the sisters gave him and me, whom he\r\nintroduced to them as a young musician, a most polite invitation to\r\ntake chocolate with them in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"We mounted the steps with a solemn air and awkward gait; we both felt\r\nvery peculiar, as if we were going to meet some adventure to which we\r\nwere not equal. In consequence of due previous preparation my uncle had\r\na good many fine things to say about art, which nobody understood,\r\nneither he himself nor any of the rest of us. This done, and after I\r\nhad thrice burned my tongue with the scalding hot chocolate, but with\r\nthe stoical fortitude of a Scævola had smiled under the fiery\r\ninfliction, Lauretta at length said that she would sing to us. Teresina\r\ntook her guitar, tuned it, and struck a few full chords. It was the\r\nfirst time I had heard the instrument, and the characteristic\r\nmysterious sounds of the trembling strings made a deep and wonderful\r\nimpression upon me. Lauretta began very softly and held on, the note\r\nrising to _fortissimo_, and then quickly broke into a crisp complicated\r\nrun through an octave and a half. I can still remember the words of the\r\nbeginning, '_Sento l'amica speme_.' My heart was oppressed; I had never\r\nhad an idea of anything of the kind. But as Lauretta continued to soar\r\nin bolder and higher flights, and as the musical notes poured upon me\r\nlike sparkling rays, thicker and thicker, then was the music that had\r\nso long lain mute and lifeless within me enkindled, rising up in\r\nstrong, grand flames. Ah! I had never heard what music was in my life\r\nbefore! Then the sisters sang one of those grand impressive duets of\r\nAbbot Steffani[6] which confine themselves to notes of a low register.\r\nMy soul was stirred at the sound of Teresina's alto, it was so\r\nsonorous, and as pure as silver bells. I couldn't for the life of me\r\nrestrain my emotion; tears started to my eyes. My uncle coughed\r\nwarningly, and cast angry glances upon me; it was all of no use, I was\r\nreally quite beside myself. This seemed to please the sisters; they\r\nbegan to inquire into the nature and extent of my musical studies; I\r\nwas ashamed of my performances in that line, and with the hardihood\r\nborn of enthusiastic admiration, I bluntly declared that that day was\r\nthe first time I had ever heard music. 'The dear good boy!' lisped\r\nLauretta, so sweetly and bewitchingly.\r\n\r\n\"On reaching home again, I was seized with a sort of fury: I pounced\r\nupon all the toccatas and fugues that I had hammered out, as well as a\r\nbeautiful copy of forty-five variations of a canonical theme that the\r\norganist had written and done me the honour of presenting to me,--all\r\nthese I threw into the fire, and laughed with spiteful glee as the\r\ndouble counterpoint smoked and crackled. Then I sat down at the piano\r\nand tried first to imitate the tones of the guitar, then to play the\r\nsisters' melodies, and finished by attempting to sing them. At length\r\nabout midnight my uncle emerged from his bedroom and greeted me with,\r\n'My boy, you'd better just stop that screeching and troop off to bed;'\r\nand he put out both candles and went back to his own room. I had no\r\nother alternative but to obey. The mysterious power of song came to me\r\nin my dreams--at least I thought so--for I sang '_Sento l'amica speme_'\r\nin excellent style.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning my uncle had hunted up everybody who could fiddle\r\nand blow for the rehearsal. He was proud to show what good musicians\r\nthe town possessed; but everything seemed to go perversely wrong.\r\nLauretta set to work at a fine scene; but very soon in the recitative\r\nthe orchestra was all at sixes and sevens, not one of them had any idea\r\nof accompaniment Lauretta screamed--raved--wept with impatience and\r\nanger. The organist was presiding at the piano; she attacked him with\r\nthe bitterest reproaches. He got up and in silent obduracy marched out\r\nof the hall. The bandmaster of the town, whom Lauretta had dubbed a\r\n'German ass!' took his violin under his arm, and, banging his hat on\r\nhis head with an air of defiance, likewise made for the door. The\r\nmembers of his company, sticking their bows under the strings of their\r\nviolins, and unscrewing the mouthpieces of their brass instruments,\r\nfollowed him. There was nobody but the dilettanti left, and they gazed\r\nabout them with disconsolate looks, whilst the receiver of excise\r\nduties exclaimed, with a tragic air, 'O heaven! how mortified I feel!'\r\nAll my diffidence was gone,--I threw myself in the bandmaster's way, I\r\nbegged, I prayed, in my distress I promised him six new minuets with\r\ndouble trios for the annual ball. I succeeded in appeasing him. He went\r\nback to his place, his companions followed suit, and soon the orchestra\r\nwas reconstituted, except that the organist was wanting. He was slowly\r\nmaking his way across the market-place, no shouting or beckoning could\r\nmake him turn back. Teresina had looked on at the whole scene with\r\nsmothered laughter, while Lauretta was now as full of glee as before\r\nshe had been of anger. She was unstinted in her praise of my efforts;\r\nshe asked me if I played the piano, and ere I knew what I was about, I\r\nsat in the organist's place with the music before me. Never before had\r\nI accompanied a singer, still less directed an orchestra. Teresina sat\r\ndown beside me at the piano and gave me every time; Lauretta encouraged\r\nme with repeated 'Bravos!' the orchestra proved manageable, and things\r\ncontinued to improve. Everything was worked out successfully at the\r\nsecond rehearsal; and the effect of the sisters' singing at the concert\r\nis not to be described.\r\n\r\n\"The sovereign's return to his capital was to be celebrated there with\r\nseveral festive demonstrations; the sisters were summoned to sing in\r\nthe theatre and at concerts. Until the time that their presence was\r\nrequired they resolved to remain in our little town, and thus it came\r\nto pass that they gave us a few more concerts. The admiration of the\r\npublic rose to a kind of madness. Old Miss Meibel, however, took with a\r\ndeliberate air a pinch of snuff out of her porcelain pug and gave her\r\nopinion that 'such impudent caterwauling was not singing; singing\r\nshould be low and melodious.' My friend, the organist, never showed\r\nhimself again, and, in truth, I did not miss him in the least I was\r\nthe happiest fellow in the world. The whole day long I spent with\r\nthe sisters, copying out the vocal scores of what they were to\r\nsing in the capital. Lauretta was my ideal; her vile caprices, her\r\nterribly passionate violence, the torments she inflicted upon me at the\r\npiano--all these I bore with patience. She alone had unsealed for me\r\nthe springs of true music. I began to study Italian, and try my hand at\r\na few canzonets. In what heavenly rapture was I plunged when Lauretta\r\nsang my compositions, or even praised them. Often it seemed to me as if\r\nit was not I who had thought out and set what she sang, but that the\r\nthought first shone forth in her singing of it. With Teresina I could\r\nnot somehow get on familiar terms; she sang but seldom, and didn't seem\r\nto make much account of all that I was doing, and sometimes I even\r\nfancied that she was laughing at me behind my back. At length the time\r\ncame for them to leave the town. And now I felt for the first time how\r\ndear Lauretta had become to me, and how impossible it would be for me\r\nto separate from her. Often, when she was in a tender, playful mood,\r\nshe had caressed me, although always in a perfectly artless fashion;\r\nnevertheless, my blood was excited, and it was nothing but the strange\r\ncoolness with which she was more usually wont to treat me that\r\nrestrained me from giving reins to my ardour and clasping her in my\r\narms in a delirium of passion. I possessed a tolerably good tenor\r\nvoice, which, however, I had never practised, but now I began to\r\ncultivate it assiduously. I frequently sang with Lauretta one of those\r\ntender Italian duets of which there exists such an endless number. We\r\nwere just singing one of these pieces, the hour of departure was close\r\nat hand--'_Senza di te ben mio, vivere non poss' io_' ('Without thee,\r\nmy own, I cannot live!') Who could resist that? I threw myself at her\r\nfeet--I was in despair. She raised me up--'But, my friend, need we then\r\npart?' I pricked up my ears with amazement. She proposed that I should\r\naccompany her and Teresina to the capital, for if I intended to devote\r\nmyself wholly to music I must leave this wretched little town some time\r\nor other. Picture to yourself one struggling in the dark depths of\r\nboundless despair, who has given up all hopes of life, and who, in the\r\nmoment in which he expects to receive the blow that is to crush him for\r\never, suddenly finds himself sitting in a glorious bright arbour of\r\nroses, where hundreds of unseen but loving voices whisper, 'You are\r\nstill alive, dear,--still alive'--and you will know how I felt then.\r\nAlong with them to the capital! that had seized upon my heart as an\r\nineradicable resolution. But I won't tire you with the details of how I\r\nset to work to convince my uncle that I ought now by all means to go to\r\nthe capital, which, moreover, was not very far away. He at length gave\r\nhis consent, and announced his intention of going with me. Here was a\r\ntricksy stroke of fortune! I dare not give utterance to my purpose of\r\ntravelling in company with the sisters. A violent cold, which my uncle\r\ncaught, proved my saviour.\r\n\r\n\"I left the town by the stage-coach, but only went as far as the first\r\nstopping-station, where I awaited my divinity. A well-lined purse\r\nenabled me to make all due and fitting preparations. I was seized with\r\nthe romantic idea of accompanying the ladies in the character of a\r\nprotecting paladin--on horseback; I secured a horse, which, though not\r\nparticularly handsome, was, its owner assured me, quiet, and I rode\r\nback at the appointed time to meet the two fair singers. I soon saw the\r\nlittle carriage, which had two seats, coming towards me. Lauretta and\r\nTeresina sat on the principal seat, whilst on the other, with her back\r\nto the driver, sat their maid, the fat little Gianna, a brown-cheeked\r\nNeapolitan. Besides this living freight, the carriage was packed full\r\nof boxes, satchels, and baskets of all sizes and shapes, such as\r\ninvariably accompany ladies when they travel. Two little pug-dogs which\r\nGianna was nursing in her lap began to bark when I gaily saluted the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\"All was going on very nicely; we were traversing the last stage of the\r\njourney, when my steed all at once conceived the idea that it was high\r\ntime to be returning homewards. Being aware that stern measures were\r\nnot always blessed with a remarkable degree of success in such cases, I\r\nfelt advised to have recourse to milder means of persuasion; but the\r\nobstinate brute remained insensible to all my well-meant exhortations.\r\nI wanted to go forwards, he backwards, and all the advantage that my\r\nefforts gave me over him was that instead of taking to his heels for\r\nhome, he continued to run round in circles. Teresina leaned forward out\r\nof the carriage and had a hearty laugh; Lauretta, holding her hands\r\nbefore her face, screamed out as if I were in imminent danger. This\r\ngave me the courage of despair, I drove the spurs into the brute's\r\nribs, but that very same moment I was roughly hurled off and found\r\nmyself sprawling on the ground. The horse stood perfectly still, and,\r\nstretching out his long neck, regarded me with what I took to be\r\nnothing else than derision. I was not able to rise to my feet; the\r\ndriver had to come and help me; Lauretta had jumped out and was weeping\r\nand lamenting; Teresina did nothing but laugh without ceasing. I had\r\nsprained my foot, and couldn't possibly mount again. How was I to get\r\non? My steed was fastened to the carriage, whilst I crept into it. Just\r\npicture us all--two rather robust females, a fat servant-girl, two\r\npug-dogs, a dozen boxes, satchels, and baskets, and me as well, all\r\npacked into a little carriage. Picture Lauretta's complaints at the\r\nuncomfortableness of her seat, the howling of the pups, the chattering\r\nof the Neapolitan, Teresina's sulks, the unspeakable pain I felt in my\r\nfoot, and you will have some idea of my enviable situation! Teresina\r\naverred that she could not endure it any longer. We stopped; in a trice\r\nshe was out of the carriage, had untied my horse, and was up in the\r\nsaddle, prancing and curvetting around us. I must indeed admit that she\r\ncut a fine figure. The dignity and elegance which marked her carriage\r\nand bearing were still more prominent on horseback. She asked for her\r\nguitar, then dropping the reins on her arm, she began to sing proud\r\nSpanish ballads with a full-toned accompaniment. Her light silk dress\r\nfluttered in the wind, its folds and creases giving rise to a sheeny\r\nplay of light, whilst the white feathers of her hat quivered and shook,\r\nlike the prattling spirits of the air which we heard in her voice.\r\nAltogether she made such a romantic figure that I could not keep my\r\neyes off her, notwithstanding that Lauretta reproached her for making\r\nherself such a fantastic simpleton, and predicted that she would suffer\r\nfor her audacity. But no accident happened; either the horse had lost\r\nall his stubbornness or he liked the fair singer better than the\r\npaladin; at any rate, Teresina did not creep back into the carriage\r\nagain until we had almost reached the gates of the town.\r\n\r\n\"If you had seen me then at concerts and operas, if you had seen me\r\nrevelling in all sorts of music, and as a diligent accompanist studying\r\narias, duets, and I don't know what besides at the piano, you would\r\nhave perceived, by the complete change in my behaviour, that I was\r\nfilled with a new and wonderful spirit. I had cast off all my rustic\r\nshyness, and sat at the pianoforte with my score before me like an\r\nexperienced professional, directing the performances of my _prima\r\ndonna_. All my mind--all my thoughts--were sweet melodies. Utterly\r\nregardless of all the rules of counterpoint, I composed all sorts of\r\ncanzonets and arias, which Lauretta sang, though only in her own room.\r\nWhy would she never sing any of my pieces at a concert? I could not\r\nunderstand it. Teresina also arose before my imagination curvetting on\r\nher proud steed with the lute in her hands, like Art herself disguised\r\nin romance. Without thinking of it consciously, I wrote several songs\r\nof a high and serious nature. Lauretta, it is true, played with her\r\nnotes like a capricious fairy queen. There was nothing upon which she\r\nventured in which she had not success. But never did a roulade cross\r\nTeresina's lips; nothing more than a simple interpolated note, at most\r\na _mordent_; but her long-sustained tones gleamed like meteors through\r\nthe darkness of night, awakening strange spirits, who came and gazed\r\nwith earnest eyes into the depths of my heart. I know not how I\r\nremained ignorant of them so long!\r\n\r\n\"The sisters were granted a benefit concert; I sang with Lauretta a\r\nlong scena from Anfossi.[7] As usual I presided at the piano. We came\r\nto the last _fermata_. Lauretta exerted all her skill and art; she\r\nwarbled trill after trill like a nightingale, executed sustained notes,\r\nthen long elaborate roulades--a whole _solfeggio_. In fact, I thought\r\nshe was almost carrying the thing too far this time; I felt a soft\r\nbreath on my cheek; Teresina stood behind me. At this moment Lauretta\r\ntook a good start with the intention of swelling up to a 'harmonic\r\nshake,' and so passing back into _a tempo_. The devil entered into me;\r\nI jammed down the keys with both hands; the orchestra followed suit;\r\nand it was all over with Lauretta's trill, just at the supreme moment\r\nwhen she was to excite everybody's astonishment. Almost annihilating me\r\nwith a look of fury, she crushed her roll of music together, tore it\r\nup, and hurled it at my head, so that the pieces flew all over me. Then\r\nshe rushed like a madwoman through the orchestra into the adjoining\r\nroom; as soon as we had concluded the piece, I followed her. She wept;\r\nshe raved. 'Out of my sight, villain,' she screamed as soon as she saw\r\nme. 'You devil, you've completely ruined me--my fame, my honour--and\r\noh! my trill. Out of my sight, you devil's own!' She made a rush\r\nat me; I escaped through the door. Whilst some one else was performing,\r\nTeresina and the music-director at length succeeded in so far pacifying\r\nher rage, that she resolved to appear again; but I was not to be\r\nallowed to touch the piano. In the last duet that the sisters sang,\r\nLauretta did contrive to introduce the swelling 'harmonic shake,' was\r\nrewarded with a storm of applause, and settled down into the best of\r\nhumours.\r\n\r\n\"But I could not get over the vile treatment which I had received at\r\nher hands in the presence of so many people, and I was firmly resolved\r\nto set off home next morning for my native town. I was actually engaged\r\nin packing my things together when Teresina came into my room.\r\nObserving what I was about, she exclaimed, astonished, 'Are you going\r\nto leave us?' I gave her to understand that after the affront which had\r\nbeen put upon me by Lauretta I could not think of remaining any longer\r\nin her society. 'And so,' replied Teresina, 'you're going to let\r\nyourself be driven away by the extravagant conduct of a little fool,\r\nwho is now heartily sorry for what she has done and said. Where else\r\ncan you better live in your art than with us? Let me tell you, it only\r\ndepends upon yourself and your own behaviour to keep her from such\r\npranks as this. You are too compliant, too tender, too gentle. Besides,\r\nyou rate her powers too highly. Her voice is indeed not bad, and it has\r\na wide compass; but what else are all these fantastic warblings and\r\nflourishes, these preposterous runs, these never-ending shakes, but\r\ndelusive artifices of style, which people admire in the same way that\r\nthey admire the foolhardy agility of a rope-dancer? Do you imagine that\r\nsuch things can make any deep impression upon us and stir the heart?\r\nThe 'harmonic shake' which you spoilt I cannot tolerate; I always feel\r\nanxious and pained when she attempts it. And then this scaling up into\r\nthe region of the third line above the stave, what is it but a violent\r\nstraining of the natural voice, which after all is the only thing that\r\nreally moves the heart? I like the middle notes and the low notes. A\r\nsound that penetrates to the heart, a real quiet, easy transition from\r\nnote to note, are what I love above all things. No useless\r\nornamentation--a firm, clear, strong note--a definite expression, which\r\ncarries away the mind and soul--that's real true singing, and that's\r\nhow I sing. If you can't be reconciled to Lauretta again, then think of\r\nTeresina, who indeed likes you so much that you shall in your own way\r\nbe her musical composer. Don't be cross--but all your elegant canzonets\r\nand arias can't be matched with this single ----,' she sang in her\r\nsonorous way a simple devotional sort of canzona which I had set a few\r\ndays before. I had never dreamed that it could sound like that I felt\r\nthe power of the music going through and through me; tears of joy and\r\nrapture stood in my eyes; I seized Teresina's hand, and pressing it to\r\nmy lips a thousand times, swore I would never leave her.\r\n\r\n\"Lauretta looked upon my intimacy with her sister with envious but\r\nsuppressed vexation, and she could not do without me, for, in spite of\r\nher skill, she was unable to study a new piece without help; she read\r\nbadly, and was rather uncertain in her time. Teresina, on the contrary,\r\nsang everything at sight, and her ear for time was unparalleled. Never\r\ndid Lauretta give such free rein to her caprice and violence as when\r\nher accompaniments were being practised. They were never right for her;\r\nshe looked upon them as a necessary evil; the piano ought not to be\r\nheard at all, it should always be _pianissimo_; so there was nothing\r\nbut giving way to her again and again, and altering the time just as\r\nthe whim happened to come into her head at the moment But now I took a\r\nfirm stand against her; I combated her impertinences; I taught her that\r\nan accompaniment devoid of energy was not conceivable, and that there\r\nwas a marked difference between supporting and carrying along the song\r\nand letting it run to riot, without form and without time. Teresina\r\nfaithfully lent me her assistance. I composed nothing but pieces for\r\nthe Church, writing all the solos for a voice of low register.\r\nTeresina, too, tyrannised over me not a little, to which I submitted\r\nwith a good grace, since she had more knowledge of, and (so at least I\r\nthought) more appreciation for, German seriousness than her sister.\r\n\r\n\"We were touring in South Germany. In a little town we met an Italian\r\ntenor who was making his way from Milan to Berlin. My fair companions\r\nwent in ecstasies over their countryman; he stuck close to them,\r\ncultivating in particular Teresina's acquaintance, so that to my great\r\nvexation I soon came to play rather a secondary part. Once, just as I\r\nwas about to enter the room with a roll of music under my arm, the\r\nvoices of my companions and the tenor, engaged in an animated\r\nconversation, fell upon my ear. My name was mentioned; I pricked up my\r\nears; I listened. I now understood Italian so well that not a word\r\nescaped me. Lauretta was describing the tragical occurrence of the\r\nconcert when I cut short her trill by prematurely striking down the\r\nconcluding notes of the bar. 'A German ass!' exclaimed the tenor. I\r\nfelt as if I must rush in and hurl the flighty hero of the boards out\r\nof the window, but I restrained myself. She then went on to say that\r\nshe had been minded to send me about my business at once, but, moved by\r\nmy clamorous entreaties, she had so far had compassion upon me as to\r\ntolerate me some time longer, since I was studying singing under her.\r\nThis, to my utter amazement, Teresina confirmed. 'Yes, he's a good\r\nchild,' she added; 'he's in love with me now and sets everything for\r\nthe alto. He is not without talent, but he must rub off that stiffness\r\nand awkwardness which is so characteristic of the Germans. I hope to\r\nmake a good composer out of him; then he shall write me some good\r\nthings--for there's very little written as yet for the alto voice--and\r\nafterwards I shall let him go his own way. He's very tiresome with his\r\nbilling and cooing and love-sick sighing, and he worries me too much\r\nwith his wearisome compositions, which have been but poor stuff up to\r\nthe present.' 'I at least have now got rid of him,' interrupted\r\nLauretta; 'and Teresina, how the fellow pestered me with his arias and\r\nduets you know very well.' And now she began to sing a duet of my\r\ncomposing, which formerly she had praised very highly. The other sister\r\ntook up the second voice, and they parodied me both in voice and in\r\nexecution in the most shameful manner. The tenor laughed till the walls\r\nrang again. My limbs froze; at once I formed an irrevocable resolve. I\r\nquietly slipped away from the door back into my own room, the windows\r\nof which looked upon a side street. Opposite was the post-office; the\r\npost-coach for Bamberg had just driven up to take in the mails and\r\npassengers. The latter were all standing ready waiting in the gateway,\r\nbut I had still an hour to spare. Hastily packing up my things, I\r\ngenerously paid the whole of the bill at the hotel, and hurried across\r\nto the post-office. As I crossed the broad street I saw the fair\r\nsisters and the Italian still standing at the window, and looking out\r\nto catch the sound of the post-horn. I leaned back in the corner, and\r\ndwelt with a good deal of satisfaction upon the crushing effect of the\r\nbitter scathing letter that I had left behind for them in the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n                      *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nWith evident gratification Theodore tossed off the rest of the fiery\r\nAleatico[8] that Edward had poured into his glass. The latter, opening\r\na new flask and skilfully shaking off the drops of oil[9] which swam at\r\nthe top, remarked, \"I should not have deemed Teresina capable of such\r\nfalseness and artfulness. I cannot banish from my mind the recollection\r\nof what a charming figure she made as she sat on horseback singing\r\nSpanish ballads, whilst the horse pranced along in graceful curvets.\"\r\n\"That was her culminating point,\" interrupted Theodore; \"I still\r\nremember the strange impression which the scene made upon me. I forgot\r\nmy pain; she seemed to me like a creature of a higher race. It is\r\nindeed very true that such moments are turning-points in one's life,\r\nand that in them many images arise which time does not avail to dim.\r\nWhenever I have succeeded with any fine _romance_, it has always been\r\nwhen Teresina's image has stepped forth from the treasure-house of my\r\nmind in clear bright colours at the moment of writing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Edward, \"but let us not forget the artistic Lauretta; and,\r\nscattering all rancour to the winds, let us drink to the health of the\r\ntwo sisters.\" They did so. \"Oh,\" exclaimed Theodore, \"how the fragrant\r\nbreezes of Italy arise out of this wine and fan my cheeks,--my blood\r\nrolls with quickened energy in my veins. Oh! why must I so soon leave\r\nthat glorious land again!\" \"As yet,\" interrupted Edward, \"as yet in all\r\nthat you have told me I can see no connection with the beautiful\r\npicture, and so I believe that you still have something more to tell me\r\nabout the sisters. Of course I perceive plainly that the ladies in the\r\npicture are none other than Lauretta and Teresina themselves.\" \"You are\r\nright, they are,\" replied Theodore; \"and my ejaculations and sighs, and\r\nmy longings after the glorious land of Italy, will form a fitting\r\nintroduction to what I still have to say. A short time ago, perhaps\r\nabout two years since, just before leaving Rome, I made a little\r\nexcursion on horseback. Before an inn stood a charming girl; the idea\r\nstruck me how nice it would be to receive a cup of wine at the hands of\r\nthe pretty child. I pulled up before the door, in a walk so thickly\r\nplanted on each side with shrubs that the sunlight could only make its\r\nway through in patches. In the distance I heard sounds of singing and\r\nthe tinkling of a guitar. I pricked up my ears and listened, for the\r\ntwo female voices affected me somehow in a singular fashion; strangely\r\nenough dim recollections began to stir within my mind, but they refused\r\nto take definite shape. I dismounted and slowly drew near to the\r\nvine-clad arbour whence the music seemed to proceed, eagerly catching\r\nup every sound in the meantime. The second voice had ceased to sing.\r\nThe first sang a canzonet alone. As I came nearer and nearer that which\r\nhad at first seemed familiar to me, and which had at first attracted my\r\nattention, gradually faded away. The singer was now in the midst of a\r\nflorid, elaborate _fermata_. Up and down she warbled, up and down; at\r\nlength she stopped, holding a note on for some time. But all at once a\r\nfemale voice began to let off a torrent of abuse, maledictions, curses,\r\nvituperations! A man protested; a second laughed. The other female\r\nvoice took part in the altercation. The quarrel continued to wax louder\r\nand more violent, with true Italian fury. At length I stood immediately\r\nin front of the arbour; an abbot rushes out and almost runs over me; he\r\nturns his head to look at me; I recognise my good friend Signor\r\nLodovico, my musical news-monger from Rome. 'What in the name of\r\nwonder'--I exclaim. 'Oh, sir! sir!' he screams, 'save me, protect me\r\nfrom this mad fury, from this crocodile, this tiger, this hyæna, this\r\ndevil of a woman. Yes, I did, I did; I was beating time to Anfossi's\r\ncanzonet, and brought down my baton too soon whilst she was in the\r\nmidst of the _fermata_; I cut short her trill; but why did I meet her\r\neyes, the devilish divinity! The deuce take all _fermatas_, I say!' In\r\na most curious state of mind I hastened into the arbour along with the\r\npriest, and recognised at the first glance the sisters Lauretta and\r\nTeresina. The former was still shrieking and raging, and her sister\r\nstill seriously remonstrating with her. Mine host, his bare arms\r\ncrossed over his chest, was looking on laughing, whilst a girl was\r\nplacing fresh flasks on the table. No sooner did the sisters catch\r\nsight of me than they threw themselves upon me exclaiming, 'Ah! Signor\r\nTeodoro!' and covered me with caresses. The quarrel was forgotten.\r\n'Here you have a composer,' said Lauretta to the abbot, 'as charming as\r\nan Italian and as strong as a German.' Both sisters, continually\r\ninterrupting each other, began to recount the happy days we had spent\r\ntogether, to speak of my musical abilities whilst still a youth, of our\r\npractisings together, of the excellence of my compositions; never did\r\nthey like singing anything else but what I had set. Teresina at length\r\ninformed me that a manager had engaged her as his first singer in\r\ntragic casts for the next carnival; but she would give him to\r\nunderstand that she would only sing on condition that the composition\r\nof at least one tragic opera was intrusted to me. The tragic was above\r\nall others my special department, and so on, and so on. Lauretta on her\r\npart maintained that it would be a pity if I did not follow my bent for\r\nthe light and the graceful, in a word, for _opera buffa_. She had been\r\nengaged as first lady singer for this species of composition; and that\r\nnobody but I should write the piece in which she was to appear was\r\nsimply a matter of course. You may fancy what my feelings were as I\r\nstood between the two. In a word, you perceive that the company which I\r\nhad joined was the same as that which Hummel painted, and that just at\r\nthe moment when the priest is on the point of cutting short Lauretta's\r\n_fermata_.\" \"But did they not make any allusion,\" asked Edward, \"to\r\nyour departure from them, or to the scathing letter?\" \"Not with a\r\nsingle syllable,\" answered Theodore, \"and you may be sure I didn't, for\r\nI had long before banished all animosity from my heart, and come to\r\nlook back upon my adventure with the sisters as a merry prank. I did,\r\nhowever, so far revert to the subject that I related to the priest how\r\nthat, several years before, exactly the same sort of mischance befell\r\nme in one of Anfossi's arias as had just befallen him. I painted the\r\nperiod of my connection with the sisters in tragi-comical colours, and,\r\ndistributing many a keen side-blow, I let them feel the superiority,\r\nwhich the ripe experiences, both of life and of art, of the years that\r\nhad elapsed in the interval had given me over them. 'And a good thing\r\nit was,' I concluded, 'that I did cut short that _fermata_, for it was\r\nevidently meant to last through eternity, and I am firmly of opinion\r\nthat if I had left the singer alone, I should be sitting at the piano\r\nnow.' 'But, signor,' replied the priest, 'what director is there who\r\nwould dare to prescribe laws to the _prima donna_? Your offence was\r\nmuch more heinous than mine, you in the concert hall, and I here in the\r\nleafy arbour. Besides, I was only director in imagination; nobody need\r\nattach any importance to that, and if the sweet fiery glances of these\r\nheavenly eyes had not fascinated me, I should not have made an ass of\r\nmyself.' The priest's last words proved tranquillising, for, although\r\nLauretta's eyes had begun to flash with anger as the priest spoke,\r\nbefore he had finished she was quite appeased.\r\n\r\n\"We spent the evening together. Many changes take place in fourteen\r\nyears, which was the interval that had passed since I had seen my fair\r\nfriends. Lauretta, although looking somewhat older, was still not\r\ndevoid of charms. Teresina had worn better, without losing her graceful\r\nform. Both were dressed in rather gay colours, and their manners were\r\njust the same as before, that is, fourteen years younger than the\r\nladies themselves. At my request Teresina sang some of the serious\r\nsongs that had once so deeply affected me, but I fancied that they\r\nsounded differently from what they did when I first heard them; and\r\nLauretta's singing too, although her voice had not appreciably lost\r\nanything, either in power or in compass, seemed to me to be quite\r\ndifferent from my recollection of it of former times The sisters'\r\nbehaviour towards me, their feigned ecstasies, their rude admiration,\r\nwhich, however, took the shape of gracious patronage, had done much to\r\nput me in a bad humour, and now the obtrusiveness of this comparison\r\nbetween the images in my mind and the not over and above pleasing\r\nreality, tended to put me in a still worse. The droll priest, who in\r\nall the sweetest words you can imagine was playing the _amoroso_ to\r\nboth sisters at once, as well as frequent applications to the good\r\nwine, at length restored me to good humour, so that we spent a very\r\npleasant evening in perfect concord and gaiety. The sisters were most\r\npressing in their invitations to me to go home with them, that we might\r\nat once talk over the parts which I was to set for them and so concert\r\nmeasures accordingly. I left Rome without taking any further steps to\r\nfind out their place of abode.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, after all,\" said Edward, \"it is to them that you owe the\r\nawakening of your genius for music.\" \"That I admit,\" replied Theodore,\r\n\"I owed them that and a host of good melodies besides, and that is just\r\nthe reason why I did not want to see them again. Every composer can\r\nrecall certain impressions which time does not obliterate. The spirit\r\nof music spake, and his voice was the creative word which suddenly\r\nawakened the kindred spirit slumbering in the breast of the artist;\r\nthen the latter rose like a sun which can nevermore set. Thus it is\r\nunquestionably true that all melodies which, stirred up in this way,\r\nproceed from the depths of the composer's being, seem to us to belong\r\nto the singer alone who fanned the first spark within us. We hear her\r\nvoice and record only what she has sung. It is, however, the\r\ninheritance of us weak mortals that, clinging to the clods, we are only\r\ntoo fain to draw down what is above the earth into the miserable\r\nnarrowness characteristic of things of the earth. Thus it comes to pass\r\nthat the singer becomes our lover--or even our wife. The spell is\r\nbroken, and the melody of her nature, which formerly revealed glorious\r\nthings, is now prostituted to complaints about broken soup-plates or\r\nink-stains in new linen. Happy is the composer who never again so long\r\nas he lives sets eyes upon the woman who by virtue of some mysterious\r\npower enkindled in him the flame of music. Even though the young\r\nartist's heart may be rent by pain and despair when the moment comes\r\nfor parting from his lovely enchantress, nevertheless her form will\r\ncontinue to exist as a divinely beautiful strain which lives on and on\r\nin the pride of youth and beauty, engendering melodies in which time\r\nafter time he perceives the lady of his love. But what is she else if\r\nnot the Highest Ideal which, working its way from within outwards, is\r\nat length reflected in the external independent form?\"\r\n\r\n\"A strange theory, but yet plausible,\" was Edward's comment, as the two\r\nfriends, arm in arm, passed out from Sala Tarone's into the street.\r\n\r\n                      *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO \"THE FERMATA\":\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Johann Erdmann Hummel, born 1769, died 1852, a German\r\npainter, studied in Italy, painted various kinds of pieces, and also\r\nwrote treatises on perspective and kindred subjects.

What befalls him in this illness._\r\n\r\nCelebrated people commonly have many ill things said of them, whether\r\nwell-founded or not And no exception was made in the case of that\r\nadmirable painter Salvator Rosa, whose living pictures cannot fail to\r\nimpart a keen and characteristic delight to those who look upon them.\r\n\r\nAt the time that Salvator's fame was ringing through Naples, Rome, and\r\nTuscany--nay, through all Italy, and painters who were desirous of\r\ngaining applause were striving to imitate his peculiar and unique\r\nstyle, his malicious and envious rivals were laboring to spread abroad\r\nall sorts of evil reports intended to sully with ugly black stains the\r\nglorious splendor of his artistic fame. They affirmed that he had at a\r\nformer period of his life belonged to a company of banditti,[1.2] and\r\nthat it was to his experiences during this lawless time that he owed\r\nall the wild, fierce, fantastically-attired figures which he introduced\r\ninto his pictures, just as the gloomy fearful wildernesses of his\r\nlandscapes--the _selve selvagge_ (savage woods)--to use Dante's\r\nexpression, were faithful representations of the haunts where they lay\r\nhidden. What was worse still, they openly charged him with having been\r\nconcerned in the atrocious and bloody revolt which had been set on foot\r\nby the notorious Masaniello[1.3] in Naples. They even described the\r\nshare he had taken in it, down to the minutest details.\r\n\r\nThe rumor ran that Aniello Falcone,[1.4] the painter of battle-pieces,\r\none of the best of Salvator's masters, had been stung into fury and\r\nfilled with bloodthirsty vengeance because the Spanish soldiers had\r\nslain one of his relatives in a hand-to-hand encounter. Without delay\r\nhe leagued together a band of daring spirits, mostly young painters,\r\nput arms into their hands, and gave them the name of the \"Company of\r\nDeath.\" And in truth this band inspired all the fear and consternation\r\nsuggested by its terrible name. At all hours of the day they traversed\r\nthe streets of Naples in little companies, and cut down without mercy\r\nevery Spaniard whom they met. They did more--they forced their way into\r\nthe holy sanctuaries, and relentlessly murdered their unfortunate foes\r\nwhom terror had driven to seek refuge there. At night they gathered\r\nround their chief, the bloody-minded madman Masaniello,[1.5] and\r\npainted him by torchlight, so that in a short time there were hundreds\r\nof these little pictures[1.6] circulating in Naples and the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThis is the ferocious band of which Salvator Rosa was alleged to have\r\nbeen a member, working hard at butchering his fellow-men by day, and by\r\nnight working just as hard at painting. The truth about him has however\r\nbeen stated by a celebrated art-critic, Taillasson,[1.7] I believe. His\r\nworks are characterised by defiant originality, and by fantastic energy\r\nboth of conception and of execution. He delighted to study Nature, not\r\nin the lovely attractiveness of green meadows, flourishing fields,\r\nsweet-smelling groves, murmuring springs, but in the sublime as seen in\r\ntowering masses of rock, in the wild sea-shore, in savage inhospitable\r\nforests; and the voices that he loved to hear were not the whisperings\r\nof the evening breeze or the musical rustle of leaves, but the roaring\r\nof the hurricane and the thunder of the cataract. To one viewing his\r\ndesolate landscapes, with the strange savage figures stealthily moving\r\nabout in them, here singly, there in troops, the uncomfortable thoughts\r\narise unbidden, \"Here's where a fearful murder took place, there's\r\nwhere the bloody corpse was hurled into the ravine,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAdmitting all this, and even that Taillasson is further right when he\r\nmaintains that Salvator's \"Plato,\" nay, that even his \"Holy St. John\r\nproclaiming the Advent of the Saviour in the Wilderness,\" look just a\r\nlittle like highway robbers--admitting this, I say, it is nevertheless\r\nunjust to argue from the character of the works to the character of the\r\nartist himself, and to assume that he, who represents with lifelike\r\nfidelity what is savage and terrible, must himself have been a savage,\r\nterrible man. He who prates most about the sword is often he who wields\r\nit the worst; he who feels in the depths of his soul all the horrors of\r\na bloody deed, so that, taking the palette or the pencil or the pen in\r\nhis hand, he is able to give living form to his feelings, is often the\r\none least capable of practising similar deeds. Enough! I don't believe\r\na single word of all those evil reports, by which men sought to brand\r\nthe excellent Salvator an abandoned murderer and robber, and I hope\r\nthat you, kindly reader, will share my opinion. Otherwise, I see\r\ngrounds for fearing that you might perhaps entertain some doubts\r\nrespecting what I am about to tell you of this artist; the Salvator I\r\nwish to put before you in this tale--that is, according to my\r\nconception of him--is a man bubbling over with the exuberance of life\r\nand fiery energy, but at the same time a man endowed with the noblest\r\nand most loyal character--a character, which, like that of all men who\r\nthink and feel deeply, is able even to control that bitter irony which\r\narises from a clear view of the significance of life. I need scarcely\r\nadd that Salvator was no less renowned as a poet and musician than as a\r\npainter. His genius was revealed in magnificent refractions. I repeat\r\nagain, I do not believe that Salvator had any share in Masaniello's\r\nbloody deeds; on the contrary, I think it was the horrors of that\r\nfearful time which drove him from Naples to Rome, where he arrived a\r\npoor poverty-stricken fugitive, just at the time that Masaniello fell.\r\n\r\nNot over well dressed, and with a scanty purse containing not more than\r\na few bright sequins[1.8] in his pocket, he crept through the gate just\r\nafter nightfall. Somehow or other, he didn't exactly know how, he\r\nwandered as far as the Piazza Navona. In better times he had once lived\r\nthere in a large house near the Pamfili Palace. With an ill-tempered\r\ngrowl, he gazed up at the large plate-glass windows glistening and\r\nglimmering in the moonlight \"Hm!\" he exclaimed peevishly, \"it'll cost\r\nme dozens of yards of coloured canvas before I can open my studio up\r\nthere again.\" But all at once he felt as if paralysed in every limb,\r\nand at the same moment more weak and feeble than he had ever felt in\r\nhis life before. \"But shall I,\" he murmured between his teeth as he\r\nsank down upon the stone steps leading up to the house door, \"shall I\r\nreally be able to finish canvas enough in the way the fools want it\r\ndone? Hm! I have a notion that that will be the end of it!\"\r\n\r\nA cold cutting night wind blew down the street. Salvator recognised\r\nthe necessity of seeking a shelter. Rising with difficulty, he\r\nstaggered on into the Corso,[1.9] and then turned into the Via\r\nBergognona. At length he stopped before a little house with only a\r\ncouple of windows, inhabited by a poor widow and her two daughters.\r\nThis women had taken him in for little pay the first time he came to\r\nRome, an unknown stranger noticed of nobody; and so he hoped again to\r\nfind a lodging with her, such as would be best suited to the sad\r\ncondition in which he then was.\r\n\r\nHe knocked confidently at the door, and several times called out his\r\nname aloud. At last he heard the old woman slowly and reluctantly\r\nwakening up out of her sleep. She shuffled to the window in her\r\nslippers, and began to rain down a shower of abuse upon the knave who\r\nwas come to worry her in this way in the middle of the night; her\r\nhouse was not a wine-shop, &c., &c. Then there ensued a good deal of\r\ncross-questioning before she recognised her former lodger's voice; but\r\non Salvator's complaining that he had fled from Naples and was unable\r\nto find a shelter in Rome, the old dame cried, \"By all the blessed\r\nsaints of Heaven! Is that you, Signor Salvator? Well now, your little\r\nroom up above, that looks on to the court, is still standing empty, and\r\nthe old fig-tree has pushed its branches right through the window and\r\ninto the room, so that you can sit and work like as if you was in a\r\nbeautiful cool arbour. Ay, and how pleased my girls will be that you\r\nhave come back again, Signor Salvator. But, d'ye know, my Margarita's\r\ngrown a big girl and fine-looking? You won't give her any more rides on\r\nyour knee now. And--and your little pussy, just fancy, three months ago\r\nshe choked herself with a fish-bone. Ah well, we all shall come to the\r\ngrave at last. But, d'ye know, my fat neighbour, who you so often\r\nlaughed at and so often painted in such funny ways--d'ye know, she\r\n_did_ marry that young fellow, Signor Luigi, after all. Ah well! _nozze\r\ne magistrati sono da dio destinati_ (marriages and magistrates are made\r\nin heaven) they say.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" cried Salvator, interrupting the old woman, \"but, Signora\r\nCaterina, I entreat you by the blessed saints, do, pray, let me in, and\r\nthen tell me all about your fig-tree and your daughters, your cat and\r\nyour fat neighbour--I am perishing of weariness and cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless me, how impatient we are,\" rejoined the old dame; \"_Chi va piano\r\nva sano, chi va presto more lesto_ (more haste less speed, take things\r\ncool and live longer), I tell you. But you are tired, you are cold;\r\nwhere are the keys? quick with the keys!\"\r\n\r\nBut the old woman still had to wake up her daughters and kindle a\r\nfire--but oh! she was such a long time about it--such a long, long\r\ntime. At last she opened the door and let poor Salvator in; but\r\nscarcely had he crossed the threshold than, overcome by fatigue and\r\nillness, he dropped on the floor as if dead. Happily the widow's son,\r\nwho generally lived at Tivoli, chanced to be at his mother's that night\r\nHe was at once turned out of his bed to make room for the sick guest,\r\nwhich he willingly submitted to.\r\n\r\nThe old woman was very fond of Salvator, putting him, as far as his\r\nartistic powers went, above all the painters in the world; and in\r\neverything that he did she also took the greatest pleasure. She was\r\ntherefore quite beside herself to see him in this lamentable condition,\r\nand wanted to run off to the neighbouring monastery to fetch her father\r\nconfessor, that he might come and fight against the adverse power of\r\nthe disease with consecrated candles or some powerful amulet or other.\r\nOn the other hand, her son thought it would be almost better to see\r\nabout getting an experienced physician at once, and off he ran there\r\nand then to the Spanish Square, where he knew the distinguished Doctor\r\nSplendiano Accoramboni dwelt. No sooner did the doctor learn that the\r\npainter Salvator Rosa lay ill in the Via Bergognona than he at once\r\ndeclared himself ready to call early and see the patient.\r\n\r\nSalvator lay unconscious, struck down by a most severe attack of fever.\r\nThe old dame had hung up two or three pictures of saints above his bed,\r\nand was praying fervently. The girls, though bathed in tears, exerted\r\nthemselves from time to time to get the sick man to swallow a few drops\r\nof the cooling lemonade which they had made, whilst their brother, who\r\nhad taken his place at the head of the bed, wiped the cold sweat from\r\nhis brow. And so morning found them, when with a loud creak the door\r\nopened, and the distinguished Doctor Splendiano Accoramboni entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIf Salvator had not been so seriously ill that the two girls' hearts\r\nwere melted in grief, they would, I think, for they were in general\r\nfrolicsome and saucy, have enjoyed a hearty laugh at the Doctor's\r\nextraordinary appearance, instead of retiring shyly, as they did, into\r\nthe corner, greatly alarmed. It will indeed be worth while to describe\r\nthe outward appearance of the little man who presented himself at Dame\r\nCaterina's in the Via Bergognona in the grey of the morning. In spite\r\nof all his excellent capabilities for growth, Doctor Splendiano\r\nAccoramboni had not been able to advance beyond the respectable stature\r\nof four feet Moreover, in the days of his youth, he had been\r\ndistinguished for his elegant figure, so that, before his head, always\r\nindeed somewhat ill-shaped, and his big cheeks, and his stately double\r\nchin had put on too much fat, before his nose had grown bulky and\r\nspread owing to overmuch indulgence in Spanish snuff, and before his\r\nlittle belly had assumed the shape of a wine-tub from too much\r\nfattening on macaroni, the priestly cut of garments, which he at that\r\ntime had affected, had suited him down to the ground. He was then in\r\ntruth a pretty little man, and accordingly the Roman ladies had styled\r\nhim their _caro puppazetto_ (sweet little pet).\r\n\r\nThat however was now a thing of the past. A German painter, seeing\r\nDoctor Splendiano walking across the Spanish Square, said--and he was\r\nperhaps not far wrong--that it looked as if some strapping fellow of\r\nsix feet or so had walked away from his own head, which had fallen\r\non the shoulders of a little marionette clown, who now had to\r\ncarry it about as his own. This curious little figure walked about in\r\npatchwork--an immense quantity of pieces of Venetian damask of a large\r\nflower pattern that had been cut up in making a dressing-gown; high up\r\nround his waist he had buckled a broad leather belt, from which an\r\nexcessively long rapier hung; whilst his snow-white wig was surmounted\r\nby a high conical cap, not unlike the obelisk in St. Peter's Square.\r\nSince the said wig, like a piece of texture all tumbled and tangled,\r\nspread out thick and wide all over his back, it might very well be\r\ntaken for the cocoon out of which the fine silkworm had crept.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Splendiano Accoramboni stared through his big, bright\r\nspectacles, with his eyes wide open, first at his patient, then at Dame\r\nCaterina. Calling her aside, he croaked with bated breath, \"There lies\r\nour talented painter Salvator Rosa, and he's lost if my skill doesn't\r\nsave him, Dame Caterina. Pray tell me when he came to lodge with you?\r\nDid he bring many beautiful large pictures with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my dear Doctor,\" replied Dame Caterina, \"the poor fellow only came\r\nlast night. And as for pictures--why, I don't know nothing about them;\r\nbut there's a big box below, and Salvator begged me to take very good\r\ncare of it, before he became senseless like what he now is. I daresay\r\nthere's a fine picture packed in it, as he painted in Naples.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Dame Caterina said was, however, a falsehood; but we shall soon\r\nsee that she had good reasons for imposing upon the Doctor in this way.\r\n\r\n\"Good! Very good!\" said the Doctor, simpering and stroking his beard;\r\nthen, with as much solemnity as his long rapier, which kept catching in\r\nall the chairs and tables he came near, would allow, he approached the\r\nsick man and felt his pulse, snorting and wheezing, so that it had a\r\nmost curious effect in the midst of the reverential silence which had\r\nfallen upon all the rest. Then he ran over in Greek and Latin the names\r\nof a hundred and twenty diseases that Salvator had not, then almost as\r\nmany which he might have had, and concluded by saying that on the spur\r\nof the moment he didn't recollect the name of his disease, but that he\r\nwould within a short time find a suitable one for it, and along\r\ntherewith, the proper remedies as well. Then he took his departure with\r\nthe same solemnity with which he had entered, leaving them all full of\r\ntrouble and anxiety.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the steps the Doctor requested to see Salvator's box;\r\nDame Caterina showed him one--in which were two or three of her\r\ndeceased husband's cloaks now laid aside, and some old worn-out shoes.\r\nThe Doctor smilingly tapped the box, on this side and on that, and\r\nremarked in a tone of satisfaction \"We shall see! we shall see!\" Some\r\nhours later he returned with a very beautiful name for his patient's\r\ndisease, and brought with him some big bottles of an evil-smelling\r\npotion, which he directed to be given to the patient constantly. This\r\nwas a work of no little trouble, for Salvator showed the greatest\r\naversion for--utter loathing of the stuff, which looked, and smelt, and\r\ntasted, as if it had been concocted from Acheron itself. Whether it was\r\nthat the disease, since it had now received a name, and in consequence\r\nreally signified something, had only just begun to put forth its\r\nvirulence, or whether it was that Splendiano's potion made too much of\r\na disturbance inside the patient--it is at any rate certain that the\r\npoor painter grew weaker and weaker from day to day, from hour to hour.\r\nAnd notwithstanding Doctor Splendiano Accoramboni's assurance that,\r\nafter the vital process had reached a state of perfect equilibrium, he\r\nwould give it a new start like the pendulum of a clock, they were all\r\nvery doubtful as to Salvator's recovery, and thought that the Doctor\r\nhad perhaps already given the pendulum such a violent start that the\r\nmechanism was quite impaired.\r\n\r\nNow it happened one day that when Salvator seemed scarcely able to move\r\na finger he was suddenly seized with the paroxysm of fever; in a\r\nmomentary accession of fictitious strength he leapt out of bed, seized\r\nthe full medicine bottles, and hurled them fiercely out of the window.\r\nJust at this moment Doctor Splendiano Accoramboni was entering the\r\nhouse, when two or three bottles came bang upon his head, smashing all\r\nto pieces, whilst the brown liquid ran in streams all down his face,\r\nand wig, and ruff. Hastily rushing into the house, he screamed like a\r\nmadman, \"Signer Salvator has gone out of his mind, he's become insane;\r\nno skill can save him now, he'll be dead in ten minutes. Give me the\r\npicture, Dame Caterina, give me the picture--it's mine, the scanty\r\nreward of all my trouble. Give me the picture, I say.\"\r\n\r\nBut when Dame Caterina opened the box, and Doctor Splendiano saw\r\nnothing but the old cloaks and torn shoes, his eyes spun round in his\r\nhead like a pair of fire-wheels; he gnashed his teeth; he stamped; he\r\nconsigned poor Salvator, the widow, and all the family to the devil;\r\nthen he rushed out of the house like an arrow from a bow, or as if he\r\nhad been shot from a cannon.\r\n\r\nAfter the violence of the paroxysm had spent itself, Salvator again\r\nrelapsed into a death-like condition. Dame Caterina was fully persuaded\r\nthat his end was really come, and away she sped as fast as she could to\r\nthe monastery, to fetch Father Boniface, that he might come and\r\nadminister the sacrament to the dying man. Father Boniface came and\r\nlooked at the sick man; he said he was well acquainted with the\r\npeculiar signs which approaching death is wont to stamp upon the human\r\ncountenance, but that for the present there were no indications of them\r\non the face of the insensible Salvator. Something might still be done,\r\nand he would procure help at once, only Doctor Splendiano Accoramboni\r\nwith his Greek names and infernal medicines was not to be allowed to\r\ncross the threshold again. The good Father set out at once, and we\r\nshall see later that he kept his word about sending the promised help.\r\n\r\nSalvator recovered consciousness again; he fancied he was lying in a\r\nbeautiful flower-scented arbour, for green boughs and leaves were\r\ninterlacing above his head. He felt a salutary warmth glowing in his\r\nveins, but it seemed to him as if somehow his left arm was bound fast\r\n\"Where am I?\" he asked in a faint voice. Then a handsome young man, who\r\nhad stood at his bedside, but whom he had not noticed until just now,\r\nthrew himself upon his knees, and grasping Salvator's right hand,\r\nkissed it and bathed it with tears, as he cried again and again, \"Oh!\r\nmy dear sir! my noble master! now it's all right; you are saved, you'll\r\nget better.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do tell me\"--began Salvator, when the young man begged him not to\r\nexert himself, for he was too weak to talk; he would tell him all that\r\nhad happened. \"You see, my esteemed and excellent sir,\" began the young\r\nman, \"you see, you were very ill when you came from Naples, but your\r\ncondition was not, I warrant, by any means so dangerous but that a few\r\nsimple remedies would soon have set you, with your strong constitution,\r\non your legs again, had you not through Carlos's well-intentioned\r\nblunder in running off for the nearest physician fallen into the hands\r\nof the redoubtable Pyramid Doctor, who was making all preparations for\r\nbringing you to your grave.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?\" exclaimed Salvator, laughing heartily,\r\nnotwithstanding the feeble state he was in. \"What do you say?--the\r\nPyramid Doctor? Ay, ay, although I was very ill, I saw that the little\r\nknave in damask patchwork, who condemned me to drink his horrid,\r\nloathsome devil's brew, wore on his head the obelisk from St. Peter's\r\nSquare--and so that's why you call him the Pyramid Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, good heavens!\" said the young man, likewise laughing, \"why,\r\nDoctor Splendiano Accoramboni must have come to see you in his ominous\r\nconical nightcap; and, do you know, you may see it flashing every\r\nmorning from his window in the Spanish Square like a portentous meteor.\r\nBut it's not by any means owing to this cap that he's called the\r\nPyramid Doctor; for that there's quite another reason. Doctor\r\nSplendiano is a great lover of pictures, and possesses in truth quite a\r\nchoice collection, which he has gained by a practice of a peculiar\r\nnature. With eager cunning he lies in wait for painters and their\r\nillnesses. More especially he loves to get foreign artists into his\r\ntoils; let them but eat an ounce or two of macaroni too much, or drink\r\na glass more Syracuse than is altogether good for them, he will afflict\r\nthem with first one and then the other disease, designating it by a\r\nformidable name, and proceeding at once to cure them of it. He\r\ngenerally bargains for a picture as the price of his attendance; and as\r\nit is only specially obstinate constitutions which are able to\r\nwithstand his powerful remedies, it generally happens that he gets his\r\npicture out of the chattels left by the poor foreigner, who meanwhile\r\nhas been carried to the Pyramid of Cestius, and buried there. It need\r\nhardly be said that Signor Splendiano always picks out the best of the\r\npictures the painter has finished, and also does not forget to bid the\r\nmen take several others along with it. The cemetery near the Pyramid of\r\nCestius is Doctor Splendiano Accoramboni's corn-field, which he\r\ndiligently cultivates, and for that reason he is called the Pyramid\r\nDoctor. Dame Caterina had taken great pains, of course with the best\r\nintentions, to make the Doctor believe that you had brought a fine\r\npicture with you; you may imagine therefore with what eagerness he\r\nconcocted his potions for you. It was a fortunate thing that in the\r\nparoxysm of fever you threw the Doctor's bottles at his head, it was\r\nalso a fortunate thing that he left you in anger, and no less fortunate\r\nwas it that Dame Caterina, who believed you were in the agonies of\r\ndeath, fetched Father Boniface to come and administer to you the\r\nsacrament. Father Boniface understands something of the art of healing;\r\nhe formed a correct diagnosis of your condition and fetched me\"----\r\n\r\n\"Then you also are a doctor?\" asked Salvator in a faint whining tone.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the young man, a deep blush mantling his cheeks, \"no, my\r\nestimable and worthy sir, I am not in the least a doctor like Signor\r\nSplendiano Accoramboni; I am however a chirurgeon. I felt as if I\r\nshould sink into the earth with fear--with joy--when Father Boniface\r\ncame and told me that Salvator Rosa lay sick unto death in the Via\r\nBergognona, and required my help. I hastened here, opened a vein in\r\nyour left arm, and you were saved. Then we brought you up into this\r\ncool airy room that you formerly occupied. Look, there's the easel\r\nwhich you left behind you; yonder are a few sketches which Dame\r\nCaterina has treasured up as if they were relics. The virulence of your\r\ndisease is subdued; simple remedies such as Father Boniface can prepare\r\nis all that you want, except good nursing, to bring back your strength\r\nagain. And now permit me once more to kiss this hand--this creative\r\nhand that charms from Nature her deepest secrets and clothes them in\r\nliving form. Permit poor Antonio Scacciati to pour out all the\r\ngratitude and immeasurable joy of his heart that Heaven has granted him\r\nto save the life of our great and noble painter, Salvator Rosa.\"\r\nTherewith the young surgeon threw himself on his knees again, and,\r\nseizing Salvator's hand, kissed it and bathed it in tears as before.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand,\" said the artist, raising himself up a little,\r\nthough with considerable difficulty, \"I don't understand, my dear\r\nAntonio, what it is that is so especially urging you to show me all\r\nthis respect. You are, you say, a chirurgeon, and we don't in a general\r\nway find this trade going hand in hand with art----\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon,\" replied the young man, casting down his eyes, \"as soon as\r\nyou have picked up your strength again, my dear sir, I have a good deal\r\nto tell you that now lies heavy on my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so,\" said Salvator; \"you may have every confidence in me--that you\r\nmay, for I don't know that any man's face has made a more direct appeal\r\nto my heart than yours. The more I look at you the more plainly I seem\r\nto trace in your features a resemblance to that incomparable young\r\npainter--I mean Sanzio.\"[1.10] Antonio's eyes were lit up with a proud,\r\nradiant light--he vainly struggled for words with which to express his\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Dame Caterina appeared, followed by Father Boniface,\r\nwho brought Salvator a medicine which he had mixed scientifically\r\naccording to prescription, and which the patient swallowed with more\r\nrelish and felt to have a more beneficial effect upon him than the\r\nAcheronian waters of the Pyramid Doctor Splendiano Accoramboni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n_By Salvator Rosa's intervention Antonio Scacciati attains to a high\r\nhonour. Antonio discloses the cause of his persistent trouble to\r\nSalvator, who consoles him and promises to help him._\r\n\r\nAnd Antonio's words proved true. The simple but salutary remedies of\r\nFather Boniface, the careful nursing of good Dame Caterina and her\r\ndaughters, the warmer weather which now came--all co-operated so well\r\ntogether with Salvator's naturally robust constitution that he soon\r\nfelt sufficiently well to think about work again; first of all he\r\ndesigned a few sketches which he thought of working out afterwards.\r\n\r\nAntonio scarcely ever left Salvator's room; he was all eyes when the\r\npainter drew out his sketches; whilst his judgment in respect to many\r\npoints showed that he must have been initiated into the secrets of art.\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" said Salvator to him one day, \"see here, Antonio, you\r\nunderstand art matters so well that I believe you have not merely\r\ncultivated your excellent judgment as a critic, but must have wielded\r\nthe brush as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will remember,\" rejoined Antonio, \"how I told you, my dear sir,\r\nwhen you were just about coming to yourself again after your long\r\nunconsciousness, that I had several things to tell you which lay heavy\r\non my mind. Now is the time for me to unfold all my heart to you. You\r\nmust know then, that though I am called Antonio Scacciati, the\r\nchirurgeon, who opened the vein in your arm for you, I belong also\r\nentirely to art--to the art which, after bidding eternal farewell to my\r\nhateful trade, I intend to devote myself for once and for all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" exclaimed Salvator, \"Ho! ho! Antonio, weigh well what you are\r\nabout to do. You are a clever chirurgeon, and perhaps will never be\r\nanything more than a bungling painter all your life long; for, with\r\nyour permission, as young as you are, you are decidedly too old to\r\nbegin to use the charcoal now. Believe me, a man's whole lifetime is\r\nscarce long enough to acquire a knowledge of the True--still less the\r\npractical ability to represent it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but, my dear sir,\" replied Antonio, smiling blandly, \"don't\r\nimagine that I should now have come to entertain the foolish idea of\r\ntaking up the difficult art of painting had I not practised it already\r\non every possible occasion from my very childhood. In spite of the fact\r\nthat my father obstinately kept me away from everything connected with\r\nart, yet Heaven was graciously pleased to throw me in the way of some\r\ncelebrated artists. I must tell you that the great Annibal[2.1]\r\ninterested himself in the orphan boy, and also that I may with justice\r\ncall myself Guido Reni's[2.2] pupil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then,\" said Salvator somewhat sharply, a way of speaking he\r\nsometimes had, \"well then, my good Antonio, you have indeed had great\r\nmasters, and so it cannot fail but that, without detriment to your\r\nsurgical practice, you must have been a great pupil. Only I don't\r\nunderstand how you, a faithful disciple of the gentle, elegant Guido,\r\nwhom you perhaps outdo in elegance in your own pictures--for pupils do\r\ndo those sort of things in their enthusiasm--how you can find any\r\npleasure in my productions, and can really regard me as a master in the\r\nArt.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, which indeed sounded a good deal like derisive mockery,\r\nthe hot blood rushed into the young man's face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let me lay aside all the diffidence which generally keeps my lips\r\nclosed,\" he said, \"and let me frankly lay bare the thoughts I have in\r\nmy mind. I tell you, Salvator, I have never honoured any master from\r\nthe depths of my soul as I do you. What I am amazed at in your works is\r\nthe sublime greatness of conception which is often revealed You grasp\r\nthe deepest secrets of Nature: you comprehend the mysterious\r\nhieroglyphics of her rocks, of her trees, and of her waterfalls, you\r\nhear her sacred voice, you understand her language, and possess the\r\npower to write down what she has said to you. Verily I can call your\r\nbold free style of painting nothing else than writing down. Man alone\r\nand his doings does not suffice you; you behold him only in the midst\r\nof Nature, and in so far as his essential character is conditioned by\r\nnatural phenomena; and in these facts I see the reason why you are only\r\ntruly great in landscapes, Salvator, with their wonderful figures.\r\nHistorical painting confines you within limits which clog your\r\nimagination to the detriment of your genius for reproducing your higher\r\nintuitions of Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's talk you've picked up from envious historical painters,\" said\r\nSalvator, interrupting his young companion; \"like them, Antonio, you\r\nthrow me the choice bone of landscape-painting that I may gnaw away at\r\nit, and so spare their own good flesh. Perhaps I do understand the\r\nhuman figure and all that is dependent upon it. But this senseless\r\nrepetition of others' words\"----\r\n\r\n\"Don't be angry,\" continued Antonio, \"don't be angry, my good sir; I am\r\nnot blindly repeating anybody's words, and I should not for a moment\r\nthink of trusting to the judgment of our painters here in Rome at any\r\nrate. Who can help greatly admiring the bold draughtsmanship, the\r\npowerful expression, but above all the living movement of your fingers?\r\nIt's plain to see that you don't work from a stiff, inflexible model,\r\nor even from a dead skeleton form; it is evident that you yourself are\r\nyour own breathing, living model, and that when you sketch or paint,\r\nyou have the figure you want to put on your canvas reflected in a great\r\nmirror opposite to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil! Antonio,\" exclaimed Salvator, laughing, \"I believe you must\r\noften have had a peep into my studio when I was not aware of it, since\r\nyou have such an accurate knowledge of what goes on within.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I may,\" replied Antonio; \"but let me go on. I am not by a long\r\nway so anxious to classify, the pictures which your powerful mind\r\nsuggests to you as are those pedantic critics who take such great pains\r\nin this line. In fact, I think that the word 'landscape,' as generally\r\nemployed, has but an indifferent application to your productions; I\r\nshould prefer to call them historical representations in the highest\r\nsense of the word. If we fancy that this or the other rock or this or\r\nthe other tree is gazing at us like a gigantic being with thoughtful\r\nearnest eyes, so again, on the other hand, this or the other group of\r\nfantastically attired men resembles some remarkable stone which has\r\nbeen endowed with life; all Nature, breathing and moving in harmonious\r\nunity, lends accents to the sublime thought which leapt into existence\r\nin your mind. This is the spirit in which I have studied your pictures,\r\nand so in this way it is, my grand and noble master, that I owe to you\r\nmy truer perceptions in matters of art. But pray don't imagine that I\r\nhave fallen into childish imitation. However much I would like to\r\npossess the free bold pencil that you possess, I do not attempt to\r\nconceal the fact that Nature's colours appear to me different from what\r\nI see them in your pictures. Although it is useful, I think, for the\r\nsake of acquiring technique, for the pupil to imitate the style of this\r\nor that master, yet, so soon as he comes to stand in any sense on his\r\nown feet, he ought to aim at representing Nature as he himself sees\r\nher. Nothing but this true method of perception, this unity with\r\noneself, can give rise to character and truth. Guido shared these\r\nsentiments; and that fiery man Preti,[2.3] who, as you are aware, is\r\ncalled _Il Calabrese_--a painter who certainly, more than any other\r\nman, has reflected upon his art--also warned me against all imitation.\r\nNow you know, Salvator, why I so much respect you, without imitating\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst the young man had been speaking, Salvator had kept his eyes\r\nfixed unchangeably upon him; he now clasped him tumultuously to his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"Antonio,\" he then said, \"what you have just now said are wise and\r\nthoughtful words. Young as you are, you are nevertheless, so far as the\r\ntrue perception of art is concerned, a long way ahead of many of our\r\nold and much vaunted masters, who have a good deal of stupid foolish\r\ntwaddle about their painting, but never get at the true root of the\r\nmatter. Body alive, man! When you were talking about my pictures, I\r\nthen began to understand myself for the first time, I believe; and\r\nbecause you do not imitate my style,--do not, like a good many others,\r\ntake a tube of black paint in your hand, or dab on a few glaring\r\ncolours, or even make two or three crippled figures with repulsive\r\nfaces look up from the midst of filth and dirt, and then say, 'There's\r\na Salvator for you!'--just for these very reasons I think a good deal\r\nof you. I tell you, my lad, you'll not find a more faithful friend than\r\nI am--that I can promise you with all my heart and soul.\"\r\n\r\nAntonio was beside himself with joy at the kind way in which the great\r\npainter thus testified to his interest in him. Salvator expressed an\r\nearnest desire to see his pictures. Antonio took him there and then to\r\nhis studio.\r\n\r\nSalvator had in truth expected to find something fairly good from the\r\nyoung man who spoke so intelligently about art, and who, it appeared,\r\nhad a good deal in him; but nevertheless he was greatly surprised at\r\nthe sight of Antonio's fine pictures. Everywhere he found boldness in\r\nconception, and correctness in drawing; and the freshness of the\r\ncolouring, the good taste in the arrangement of the drapery, the\r\nuncommon delicacy of the extremities, the exquisite grace of the heads,\r\nwere all so many evidences that he was no unworthy pupil of the great\r\nReni. But Antonio had avoided this master's besetting sin of an\r\nendeavour, only too conspicuous, to sacrifice expression to beauty. It\r\nwas plain that Antonio was aiming to reach Annibal's strength, without\r\nhaving as yet succeeded.\r\n\r\nSalvator spent some considerable time of thoughtful silence in the\r\nexamination of each of the pictures. Then he said, \"Listen, Antonio: it\r\nis indeed undeniable that you were born to follow the noble art of\r\npainting. For not only has Nature endowed you with the creative spirit\r\nfrom which the finest thoughts pour forth in an inexhaustible stream,\r\nbut she has also granted you the rare ability to surmount in a short\r\nspace of time the difficulties of technique. It would only be false\r\nflattery if I were to tell you that you had yet advanced to the level\r\nof your masters, that you are yet equal to Guido's exquisite grace or\r\nto Annibal's strength; but certain I am that you excel by a long way\r\nall the painters who hold up their heads so proudly in the Academy of\r\nSt. Luke[2.4] here--Tiarini,[2.5] Gessi,[2.6] Sementa,[2.7] and all\r\nthe rest of them, not even excepting Lanfranco[2.8] himself, for he\r\nonly understands fresco-painting. And yet, Antonio, and yet, if I were\r\nin your place, I should deliberate awhile before throwing away the\r\nlancet altogether, and confining myself entirely to the pencil That\r\nsounds rather strange, but listen to me. Art seems to be having a bad\r\ntime of it just now, or rather the devil seems to be very busy amongst\r\nour painters now-a-days, bravely setting them together by the ears. If\r\nyou cannot make up your mind to put up with all sorts of annoyances, to\r\nendure more and more scorn and contumely in proportion as you advance\r\nin art, and as your fame spreads to meet with malicious scoundrels\r\neverywhere, who with a friendly face will force themselves upon you in\r\norder to ruin you the more surely afterwards,--if you cannot, I say,\r\nmake up your mind to endure all this--let painting alone. Think of the\r\nfate of your teacher, the great Annibal, whom a rascally band of rivals\r\nmalignantly persecuted in Naples, so that he did not receive one single\r\ncommission for a great work, being everywhere rejected with contempt;\r\nand this is said to have been instrumental in bringing about his early\r\ndeath. Think of what happened to Domenichino[2.9] when he was painting\r\nthe dome of the chapel of St. Januarius. Didn't the villains of\r\npainters--I won't mention a single name, not even the rascals\r\nBelisario[2.10] and Ribera[2.11]--didn't they bribe Domenichino's\r\nservant to strew ashes in the lime? So the plaster wouldn't stick fast\r\non the walls, and the painting had no stability. Think of all that, and\r\nexamine yourself well whether your spirit is strong enough to endure\r\nthings like that, for if not, your artistic power will be broken, and\r\nalong with the resolute courage for work you will also lose your\r\nability.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Salvator,\" replied Antonio, \"it would hardly be possible for me\r\nto have more scorn and contumely to endure, supposing I took up\r\npainting entirely and exclusively, then I have already endured whilst\r\nmerely a chirurgeon. You have been pleased with my pictures, you have\r\nindeed! and at the same time declared from inner conviction that I am\r\ncapable of doing better things than several of our painters of the\r\nAcademy. But these are just the men who turn up their noses at all that\r\nI have industriously produced, and say contemptuously, 'Do look, here's\r\nour chirurgeon wants to be a painter!' And for this very reason my\r\nresolve is only the more unshaken; I will sever myself from a trade\r\nthat grows with every day more hateful. Upon you, my honoured master, I\r\nnow stake all my hopes. Your word is powerful; if you would speak a\r\ngood word for me, you might overthrow my envious persecutors at a\r\nsingle blow, and put me in the place where I ought to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"You repose great confidence in me,\" rejoined Salvator. \"But now that\r\nwe thoroughly understand each other's views on painting, and I have\r\nseen your works, I don't really know that there is anybody for whom I\r\nwould rather take up the cudgels than for you.\"\r\n\r\nSalvator once more inspected Antonio's pictures, and stopped before one\r\nrepresenting a \"Magdalene at the Saviour's feet,\" which he especially\r\npraised.\r\n\r\n\"In this Magdalene,\" he said, \"you have deviated from the usual mode of\r\nrepresentation. Your Magdalene is not a thoughtful virgin, but a lovely\r\nartless child rather, and yet she is such a marvellous child that\r\nhardly anybody else but Guido could have painted her. There is a unique\r\ncharm in her dainty figure; you must have painted with inspiration;\r\nand, if I mistake not, the original of this Magdalene is alive and to\r\nbe found in Rome. Come, confess, Antonio, you are in love!\"\r\n\r\nAntonio's eyes sought the ground, whilst he said in a low shy voice,\r\n\"Nothing escapes your penetration, my dear sir; perhaps it is as you\r\nsay, but do not blame me for it. That picture I set the highest store\r\nby, and hitherto I have guarded it as a holy secret from all men's\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?\" interrupted Salvator. \"None of the painters here\r\nhave seen your picture?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not one,\" was Antonio's reply.\r\n\r\n\"All right then, Antonio,\" continued Salvator, his eyes sparkling with\r\ndelight \"Very well then, you may rely upon it, I will overwhelm your\r\nenvious overweening persecutors, and get you the honour you deserve.\r\nIntrust your picture to me; bring it to my studio secretly by night,\r\nand then leave all the rest to me. Will you do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gladly, with all my heart,\" replied Antonio. \"And now I should very\r\nmuch like to talk to you about my love-troubles as well; but I feel as\r\nif I ought not to do so to-day, after we have opened our minds to each\r\nother on the subject of art. I also entreat you to grant me your\r\nassistance both in word and deed later on in this matter of my love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at your service,\" said Salvator, \"for both, both when and where\r\nyou require me.\" Then as he was going away, he once more turned round\r\nand said, smiling, \"See here, Antonio, when you disclosed to me the\r\nfact that you were a painter, I was very sorry that I had spoken about\r\nyour resemblance to Sanzio. I took it for granted that you were as\r\nsilly as most of our young folk, who, if they bear but the slightest\r\nresemblance in the face to any great master, at once trim their beard\r\nor hair as he does, and from this cause fancy it is their business to\r\nimitate the style of the master in their art achievements, even though\r\nit is a manifest violation of their natural talents to do so. Neither\r\nof us has mentioned Raphael's name, but I assure you that I have\r\ndiscerned in your pictures clear indications that you have grasped the\r\nfull significance of the inimitable thoughts which are reflected in the\r\nworks of this the greatest of the painters of the age. You understand\r\nRaphael, and would give me a different answer from what Velasquez[2.12]\r\ndid when I asked him not long ago what he thought of Sanzio. 'Titian,'\r\nhe replied, 'is the greatest painter; Raphael knows nothing about\r\ncarnation.' This Spaniard, methinks, understands flesh but not\r\ncriticism; and yet these men in St. Luke elevate him to the clouds\r\nbecause he once painted cherries which the sparrows picked at.\"[2.13]\r\n\r\nIt happened not many days afterwards that the Academicians of St. Luke\r\nmet together in their church to prove the works which had been\r\nannounced for exhibition. There too Salvator had sent Scacciati's fine\r\npicture. In spite of themselves the painters were greatly struck with\r\nits grace and power; and from all lips there was heard nothing but the\r\nmost extravagant praise when Salvator informed them that he had brought\r\nthe picture with him from Naples, as the legacy of a young painter who\r\nhad been cut off in the pride of his days.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before all Rome was crowding to see and admire the\r\npicture of the young unknown painter who had died so young; it was\r\nunanimously agreed that no such work had been done since Guido Reni's\r\ntime; some even went so far in their just enthusiasm as to place this\r\nexquisitely lovely Magdalene before Guido's creations of a similar\r\nkind. Amongst the crowd of people who were always gathered round\r\nScacciati's picture, Salvator one day observed a man who, besides\r\npresenting a most extraordinary appearance, behaved as if he were\r\ncrazy. Well advanced in years, he was tall, thin as a spindle, with a\r\npale face, a long sharp nose, a chin equally as long, ending moreover\r\nin a little pointed beard, and with grey, gleaming eyes. On the top of\r\nhis light sand-coloured wig he had set a high hat with a magnificent\r\nfeather; he wore a short dark red mantle or cape with many bright\r\nbuttons, a sky-blue doublet slashed in the Spanish style, immense\r\nleather gauntlets with silver fringes, a long rapier at his side, light\r\ngrey stockings drawn up above his bony knees and gartered with yellow\r\nribbons, whilst he had bows of the same sort of yellow ribbon on his\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable figure was standing before the picture like one\r\nenraptured: he raised himself on tiptoe; he stooped down till he became\r\nquite small; then he jumped up with both feet at once, heaved deep\r\nsighs, groaned, nipped his eyes so close together that the tears began\r\nto trickle down his cheeks, opened them wide again, fixed his gaze\r\nimmovably upon the charming Magdalene, sighed again, lisped in a thin,\r\nquerulous, mutilated voice, \"_Ah! carissima--benedettissima! Ah!\r\nMarianna--Mariannina--bellissima_,\" &c. (\"Oh! dearest--most adored! Ah!\r\nMarianna--sweet Marianna! my most beautiful!\") Salvator, who had a mad\r\nfancy for such oddities, drew near to the old fellow, intending to\r\nengage him in conversation about Scacciati's work, which seemed to\r\nafford him so much exquisite delight Without paying any particular heed\r\nto Salvator, the old gentleman stood cursing his poverty, because he\r\ncould not give a million sequins for the picture, and place it under\r\nlock and key where nobody could set their infernal eyes upon it. Then,\r\nhopping up and down again, he blessed the Virgin and all the holy\r\nsaints that the reprobate artist who had painted the heavenly picture\r\nwhich was driving him to despair and madness was dead.\r\n\r\nSalvator concluded that the man either was out of his mind, or was an\r\nAcademician of St. Luke with whom he was unacquainted.\r\n\r\nAll Rome was full of Scacciati's wonderful picture; people could\r\nscarcely talk about anything else, and this of course was convincing\r\nproof of the excellence of the work. And when the painters were again\r\nassembled in the church of St. Luke, to decide about the admission of\r\ncertain other pictures which had been announced for exhibition,\r\nSalvator Rosa all at once asked, whether the painter of the \"Magdalene\r\nat the Saviour's Feet\" was not worthy of being admitted a member of the\r\nAcademy. They all with one accord, including even that hairsplitter in\r\ncriticism, Baron Josépin,[2.14] declared that such a great artist would\r\nhave been an ornament to the Academy, and expressed their sorrow at his\r\ndeath in the choicest phrases, although, like the crazy old man, they\r\nwere praising Heaven in their hearts that he was dead. Still more, they\r\nwere so far carried away by their enthusiasm that they passed a\r\nresolution to the effect that the admirable young painter whom death\r\nhad snatched away from art so early should be nominated a member of the\r\nAcademy in his grave, and that masses should be read for the benefit of\r\nhis soul in the church of St. Luke. They therefore begged Salvator to\r\ninform them what was the full name of the deceased, the date of his\r\nbirth, the place where he was born, &c.\r\n\r\nThen Salvator rose and said in a loud voice, \"Signors, the honour you\r\nare anxious to render to a dead man you can more easily bestow upon a\r\nliving man who walks in your midst. Learn that the 'Magdalene at the\r\nSaviour's Feet'--the picture which you so justly exalt above all other\r\nartistic productions that the last few years have given us, is not the\r\nwork of a dead Neapolitan painter as I pretended (this I did simply to\r\nget an unbiassed judgment from you); that painting, that masterpiece,\r\nwhich all Rome is admiring, is from the hand of Signor Antonio\r\nScacciati, the chirurgeon.\"\r\n\r\nThe painters sat staring at Salvator as if suddenly thunderstruck,\r\nincapable of either moving or uttering a single sound. He, however,\r\nafter quietly exulting over their embarrassment for some minutes,\r\ncontinued, \"Well now, signors, you would not tolerate the worthy\r\nAntonio amongst you because he is a chirurgeon; but I think that the\r\nillustrious Academy of St. Luke has great need of a surgeon to set the\r\nlimbs of the many crippled figures which emerge from the studios of a\r\ngood many amongst your number. But of course you will no longer scruple\r\nto do what you ought to have done long ago, namely, elect that\r\nexcellent painter Antonio Scacciati a member of the Academy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Academicians, swallowing Salvator's bitter pill, feigned to be\r\nhighly delighted that Antonio had in this way given such incontestable\r\nproofs of his talent, and with all due ceremony nominated him a member\r\nof the Academy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became known in Rome that Antonio was the author of the\r\nwonderful picture he was overwhelmed with congratulations, and even\r\nwith commissions for great works, which poured in upon him from all\r\nsides. Thus by Salvator's shrewd and cunning stratagem the young man\r\nemerged all at once out of his obscurity, and with the first real step\r\nhe took on his artistic career rose to great honour.\r\n\r\nAntonio revelled in ecstasies of delight. So much the more therefore\r\ndid Salvator wonder to see him, some days later, appear with his face\r\npale and distorted, utterly miserable and woebegone. \"Ah! Salvator!\"\r\nsaid Antonio, \"what advantage has it been to me that you have helped me\r\nto rise to a level far beyond my expectations, that I am now\r\noverwhelmed with praise and honour, that the prospect of a most\r\nsuccessful artistic career is opening out before me? Oh! I am utterly\r\nmiserable, for the picture to which, next to you, my dear sir, I owe my\r\ngreat triumph, has proved the source of my lasting misfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" replied Salvator, \"don't sin against either your art or your\r\npicture. I don't believe a word about the terrible misfortune which,\r\nyou say, has befallen you. You are in love, and I presume you can't get\r\nall your wishes gratified at once, on the spur of the moment; that's\r\nall it is. Lovers are like children; they scream and cry if anybody\r\nonly just touches their doll. Have done, I pray you, with that\r\nlamentation, for I tell you I can't do with it. Come now, sit yourself\r\ndown there and quietly tell me all about your fair Magdalene, and give\r\nme the history of your love affair, and let me know what are the stones\r\nof offence that we have to remove, for I promise you my help\r\nbeforehand. The more adventurous the schemes are which we shall have to\r\nundertake, the more I shall like them. In fact, my blood is coursing\r\nhotly in my veins again, and my regimen requires that I engage in a few\r\nwild pranks. But go on with your story, Antonio, and as I said, let's\r\nhave it quietly without any sighs and lamentations, without any Ohs!\r\nand Ahs!\"\r\n\r\nAntonio took his seat on the stool which Salvator had pushed up to the\r\neasel at which he was working, and began as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"There is a high house in the Via Ripetta,[2.15] with a balcony which\r\nprojects far over the street so as at once to strike the eye of any one\r\nentering through the Porta del Popolo, and there dwells perhaps the\r\nmost whimsical oddity in all Rome,--an old bachelor with every fault\r\nthat belongs to that class of persons--avaricious, vain, anxious to\r\nappear young, amorous, foppish. He is tall, as thin as a switch, wears\r\na gay Spanish costume, a sandy wig, a conical hat, leather gauntlets, a\r\nrapier at his side\"----\r\n\r\n\"Stop, stop!\" cried Salvator, interrupting him, \"excuse me a minute or\r\ntwo, Antonio.\" Then, turning about the picture at which he was\r\npainting, he seized his charcoal and in a few free bold strokes\r\nsketched on the back side of the canvas the eccentric old gentleman\r\nwhom he had seen behaving like a crazed man in front of Antonio's\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\"By all the saints!\" cried Antonio, as he leapt to his feet, and,\r\nforgetful of his unhappiness, burst out into a loud laugh, \"by all the\r\nsaints! that's he! That's Signor Pasquale Capuzzi, whom I was just\r\ndescribing, that's he to the very T.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you see,\" said Salvator calmly, \"that I am already acquainted with\r\nthe worthy gentleman who most probably is your bitter enemy. But go\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor Pasquale Capuzzi,\" continued Antonio, \"is as rich as Cr[oe]sus,\r\nbut at the same time, as I just told you, a sordid miser and an\r\nincurable coxcomb. The best thing about him is that he loves art,\r\nparticularly music and painting; but he mixes up so much folly with it\r\nall that even in these things there's no getting on with him. He\r\nconsiders himself the greatest musical composer in the world, and that\r\nthere's not a singer in the Papal choir who can at all approach him.\r\nAccordingly he looks down upon our old Frescobaldi[2.16] with contempt;\r\nand when the Romans talk about the wonderful charm of Ceccarelli's\r\nvoice, he informs them that Ceccarelli knows as much about singing as a\r\npair of top-boots, and that he, Capuzzi, knows which is the right way\r\nto fascinate the public. But as the first singer of the Pope bears the\r\nproud name of Signor Odoardo Ceccarelli di Merania, so our Capuzzi is\r\ngreatly delighted when anybody calls him Signor Pasquale Capuzzi di\r\nSenigaglia; for it was in Senigaglia[2.17] that he was born, and the\r\npopular rumour goes that his mother, being startled at sight of a\r\nsea-dog (seal) suddenly rising to the surface, gave birth to him in a\r\nfisherman's boat, and that accounts, it is said, for a good deal of the\r\nsea-cur in his nature. Several years ago he brought out an opera on the\r\nstage, which was fearfully hissed; but that hasn't cured him of his\r\nmania for writing execrable music. Indeed, when he heard Francesco\r\nCavalli's[2.18] opera _Le Nozze di Feti e di Peleo_, he swore that the\r\ncomposer had filched the sublimest of the thoughts from his own\r\nimmortal works, for which he was near being thrashed and even stabbed.\r\nHe still has a craze for singing arias, and accompanies his hideous\r\nsqualling on a wretched jarring, jangling guitar, all out of tune. His\r\nfaithful Pylades is an ill-bred dwarfish eunuch, whom the Romans call\r\nPitichinaccio. There is a third member of the company--guess who it\r\nis?--Why, none other than the Pyramid Doctor, who kicks up a noise like\r\na melancholy ass and yet fancies he's singing an excellent bass, quite\r\nas good as Martinelli of the Papal choir. Now these three estimable\r\npeople are in the habit of meeting in the evening on the balcony of\r\nCapuzzi's house, where they sing Carissimi's[2.19] motets, until all\r\nthe dogs and cats in the neighbourhood round break out into dirges of\r\nmiawing and howling, and all their neighbours heartily wish the devil\r\nwould run away with all the blessed three.\r\n\r\n\"With this whimsical old fellow, Signor Pasquale Capuzzi, of whom my\r\ndescription will have enabled you to form a tolerably adequate idea, my\r\nfather lived on terms of intimacy, since he trimmed his wig and beard.\r\nWhen my father died, I undertook this business; and Capuzzi was in the\r\nhighest degree satisfied with me, because, as he once affirmed, I knew\r\nbetter than anybody else how to give his moustaches a bold upward\r\ntwirl; but the real reason was because I was satisfied with the few\r\npence with which he rewarded me for my pains. But he firmly believed\r\nthat he more than richly indemnified me, since, whilst I was trimming\r\nhis beard, he always closed his eyes and croaked through an aria from\r\nhis own compositions, which, however, almost split my ears; and yet the\r\nold fellow's crazy gestures afforded me a good deal of amusement, so\r\nthat I continued to attend him. One day when I went, I quietly ascended\r\nthe stairs, knocked at the door, and opened it, when lo, there was a\r\ngirl--an angel of light, who came to meet me. You know my Magdalene; it\r\nwas she. I stood stock still, rooted to the spot. No, Salvator, you\r\nshall have no Ohs! and Ahs! Well, the first sight of this, the most\r\nlovely maiden of her sex, enkindled in me the most ardent passionate\r\nlove. The old man informed me with a smirk that the young lady was the\r\ndaughter of his brother Pietro, who had died at Senigaglia, that her\r\nname was Marianna, and that she was quite an orphan; being her uncle\r\nand guardian, he had taken her into his house. You can easily imagine\r\nthat henceforward Capuzzi's house was my Paradise. But no matter\r\nwhat devices I had recourse to, I could never succeed in getting a\r\n_téte-à-téte_ with Marianna, even for a single moment. Her glances,\r\nhowever, and many a stolen sigh, and many a soft pressure of the hand,\r\nresolved all doubts as to my good fortune. The old man divined what I\r\nwas after,--which was not a very difficult thing for him to do. He\r\ninformed me that my behaviour towards his niece was not such as to\r\nplease him altogether, and he asked me what was the real purport of my\r\nattentions. Then I frankly confessed that I loved Marianna with all my\r\nheart, and that the greatest earthly happiness I could conceive was a\r\nunion with her. Whereupon Capuzzi, after measuring me from top to toe,\r\nburst out in a guffaw of contempt, and declared that he never had any\r\nidea that such lofty thoughts could haunt the brain of a paltry barber.\r\nI was almost boiling with rage; I said he knew very well that I was no\r\npaltry barber but rather a good surgeon, and, moreover, in so far as\r\nconcerned the noble art of painting, a faithful pupil of the great\r\nAnnibal Caracci and of the unrivalled Guido Reni. But the infamous\r\nCapuzzi only replied by a still louder guffaw of laughter, and in his\r\nhorrible falsetto squeaked, 'See here, my sweet Signor barber, my\r\nexcellent Signor surgeon, my honoured Annibal Caracci, my beloved Guido\r\nReni, be off to the devil, and don't ever show yourself here again, if\r\nyou don't want your legs broken.' Therewith the cranky, knock-kneed old\r\nfool laid hold of me with no less an intention than to kick me out of\r\nthe room, and hurl me down the stairs. But that, you know, was past\r\neverything. With ungovernable fury I seized the old fellow and tripped\r\nhim up, so that his legs stuck uppermost in the air; and there I left\r\nhim screaming aloud, whilst I ran down the stairs and out of the\r\nhouse-door; which, I need hardly say, has been closed to me ever since.\r\n\r\n\"And that's how matters stood when you came to Rome and when Heaven\r\ninspired Father Boniface with the happy idea of bringing me to you.\r\nThen so soon as your clever trick had brought me the success for which\r\nI had so long been vainly striving, that is, when I was accepted by the\r\nAcademy of St. Luke, and all Rome was heaping up praise and honour upon\r\nme to a lavish extent, I went straightway to the old gentleman and\r\nsuddenly presented myself before him in his own room, like a\r\nthreatening apparition. Such at least he must have thought me, for he\r\ngrew as pale as a corpse, and retreated behind a great table, trembling\r\nin every limb. And in a firm and earnest way I represented to him that\r\nit was not now a paltry barber or a surgeon, but a celebrated painter\r\nand Academician of St. Luke, Antonio Scacciati, to whom he would not, T\r\nhoped, refuse the hand of his niece Marianna. You should have seen into\r\nwhat a passion the old fellow flew. He screamed; he flourished his arms\r\nabout like one possessed of devils; he yelled that I, a ruffianly\r\nmurderer, was seeking his life, that I had stolen his Marianna from him\r\nsince I had portrayed her in my picture, and it was driving him mad,\r\ndriving him to despair, for all the world, all the world, were fixing\r\ntheir covetous, lustful eyes upon his Marianna, his life, his hope, his\r\nall; but I had better take care, he would burn my house over my head,\r\nand me and my picture in it. And therewith he kicked up such a din,\r\nshouting, 'Fire! Murder! Thieves! Help!' that I was perfectly\r\nconfounded, and only thought of making the best of my way out of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"The crackbrained old fool is over head and ears in love with his\r\nniece; he keeps her under lock and key; and as soon as he succeeds in\r\ngetting dispensation from the Pope, he will compel her to a shameful\r\nalliance with himself. All hope for me is lost!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay, not quite,\" said Salvator, laughing, \"I am of opinion that\r\nthings could not be in a better form for you, Marianna loves you, of\r\nthat you are convinced; and all we have to do is to get her out of the\r\npower of that fantastic old gentleman, Signor Pasquale Capuzzi. I\r\nshould like to know what there is to hinder a couple of stout\r\nenterprising fellows like you and me from accomplishing this. Pluck up\r\nyour courage, Antonio. Instead of bewailing, and sighing, and fainting\r\nlike a lovesick swain, it would be better to set to work to think out\r\nsome plan for rescuing your Marianna. You just wait and see, Antonio,\r\nhow finely we'll circumvent the old dotard; in such like emprises, the\r\nwildest extravagance hardly seems to me wild enough. I'll set about it\r\nat once, and learn what I can about the old man, and about his usual\r\nhabits of life. But you must not be seen in this affair, Antonio. Go\r\naway quietly home, and come back to me early to-morrow morning, then\r\nwe'll consider our first plan of attack.\"\r\n\r\nHerewith Salvator shook the paint out of his brush, threw on his\r\nmantle, and hurried to the Corso, whilst Antonio betook himself home as\r\nSalvator had bidden him--his heart comforted and full of lusty hope\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n                        *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\n_Signor Pasquale Capuzzi turns up at Salvator Rosa's studio. What takes\r\nplace there. The cunning scheme which Rosa and Scacciati carry out, and\r\nthe consequences of the same._\r\n\r\nNext morning Salvator, having in the meantime inquired into Capuzzi's\r\nhabits of life, very greatly surprised Antonio by a description of\r\nthem, even down to the minutest details.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Marianna,\" said Salvator, \"leads a sad life of it with the crazy\r\nold fellow. There he sits sighing and ogling the whole day long, and,\r\nwhat is worse still, in order to soften her heart towards him, he sings\r\nher all and sundry love ditties that he has ever composed or intends to\r\ncompose. At the same time he is so monstrously jealous that he will not\r\neven permit the poor young girl to have the usual female attendance,\r\nfor fear of intrigues and amours, which the maid might be induced to\r\nengage in. Instead, a hideous little apparition with hollow eyes and\r\npale flabby cheeks appears every morning and evening to perform for\r\nsweet Marianna the services of a tiring-maid. And this little\r\napparition is nobody else but that tiny Tomb Thumb of a Pitichinaccio,\r\nwho has to don female attire. Capuzzi, whenever he leaves home,\r\ncarefully locks and bolts every door; besides which there is always a\r\nconfounded fellow keeping watch below, who was formerly a bravo, and\r\nthen a gendarme, and now lives under Capuzzi's rooms. It seems,\r\ntherefore, a matter almost impossible to effect an entrance into his\r\nhouse, but nevertheless I promise you, Antonio, that this very night\r\nyou shall be in Capuzzi's own room and shall see your Marianna, though\r\nthis time it will only be in Capuzzi's presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?\" cried Antonio, quite excited; \"what do you say? We\r\nshall manage it to-night? I thought it was impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there,\" continued Salvator, \"keep still, Antonio, and let us\r\nquietly consider how we may with safety carry out the plan which I have\r\nconceived. But in the first place I must tell you that I have already\r\nscraped an acquaintance with Signor Pasquale Capuzzi without knowing\r\nit. That wretched spinet, which stands in the comer there, belongs to\r\nthe old fellow, and he wants me to pay him the preposterous sum of ten\r\nducats[3.1] for it. When I was convalescent I longed for some music,\r\nwhich always comforts me and does me a deal of good, so I begged my\r\nlandlady to get me some such an instrument as that Dame Caterina soon\r\nascertained that there was an old gentleman living in the Via Ripetta\r\nwho had a fine spinet to sell I got the instrument brought here. I did\r\nnot trouble myself either about the price or about the owner. It was\r\nonly yesterday evening that I learned quite by chance that the\r\ngentleman who intended to cheat me with this rickety old thing was\r\nSignor Pasquale Capuzzi. Dame Caterina had enlisted the services of an\r\nacquaintance living in the same house, and indeed on the same floor as\r\nCapuzzi,--and now you can easily guess whence I have got all my budget\r\nof news.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Antonio, \"then the way to get in is found; your\r\nlandlady\"----\r\n\r\n\"I know very well, Antonio,\" said Salvator, cutting him short, \"I know\r\nwhat you're going to say. You think you can find a way to your Marianna\r\nthrough Dame Caterina. But you'll find that we can't do anything of\r\nthat sort; the good dame is far too talkative; she can't keep the least\r\nsecret, and so we can't for a single moment think of employing her in\r\nthis business. Now just quietly listen to me. Every evening when it's\r\ndark Signor Pasquale, although it's very hard work for him owing to his\r\nbeing knock-kneed, carries his little friend the eunuch home in his\r\narms, as soon as he has finished his duties as maid. Nothing in the\r\nworld could induce the timid Pitichinaccio to set foot on the pavement\r\nat that time of night. So that when\"----\r\n\r\nAt this moment somebody knocked at Salvator's door, and to the\r\nconsternation of both, Signor Pasquale stepped in in all the splendour\r\nof his gala attire. On catching sight of Scacciati he stood stock still\r\nas if paralysed, and then, opening his eyes wide, he gasped for air as\r\nthough he had some difficulty in breathing. But Salvator hastily ran to\r\nmeet him, and took him by both hands, saying, \"My dear Signor Pasquale,\r\nyour presence in my humble dwelling is, I feel, a very great honour.\r\nMay I presume that it is your love for art which brings you to me? You\r\nwish to see the newest things I have done, perchance to give me a\r\ncommission for some work. Pray in what, my dear Signor Pasquale, can I\r\nserve you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a word or two to say to you, my dear Signor Salvator,\"\r\nstammered Capuzzi painfully, \"but--alone--when you are alone. With your\r\nleave I will withdraw and come again at a more seasonable time.\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" said Salvator, holding the old gentleman fast, \"by no\r\nmeans, my dear sir. You need not stir a step; you could not have come\r\nat a more seasonable time, for, since you are a great admirer of the\r\nnoble art of painting, and the patron of all good painters, I am sure\r\nyou will be greatly pleased for me to introduce to you Antonio\r\nScacciati here, the first painter of our time, whose glorious work--the\r\nwonderful 'Magdalene at the Saviour's Feet'--has excited throughout all\r\nRome the most enthusiastic admiration. _You_ too, I need hardly say,\r\nhave also formed a high opinion of the work, and must be very anxious\r\nto know the great artist himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was seized with a violent trembling; he shook as if he had\r\na shivering fit of the ague, and shot fiery wrathful looks at poor\r\nAntonio. He however approached the old gentleman, and, bowing with\r\npolished courtesy, assured him that he esteemed himself happy at\r\nmeeting in such an unexpected way with Signor Pasquale Capuzzi, whose\r\ngreat learning in music as well as in painting was a theme for wonder\r\nnot only in Rome but throughout all Italy, and he concluded by\r\nrequesting the honour of his patronage.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour of Antonio, in pretending to meet the old gentleman for\r\nthe first time in his life, and in addressing him in such flattering\r\nphrases, soon brought him round again. He forced his features into a\r\nsimpering smile, and, as Salvator now let his hands loose, gave his\r\nmoustache an elegant upward curl, at the same time stammering out a few\r\nunintelligible words. Then, turning to Salvator, he requested payment\r\nof the ten ducats for the spinet he had sold him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that trifling little matter we can settle afterwards, my good\r\nsir,\" was Salvator's answer. \"First have the goodness to look at this\r\nsketch of a picture which I have drawn, and drink a glass of good\r\nSyracuse whilst you do so.\" Salvator meanwhile placed his sketch on the\r\neasel and moved up a chair for the old gentleman, and then, when he had\r\ntaken his seat, he presented him with a large and handsome wine-cup\r\nfull of good Syracuse--the little pearl-like bubbles rising gaily to\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nSignor Pasquale was very fond of a glass of good wine--when he had\r\nnothing to pay for it; and now he ought to have been in an especially\r\nhappy frame of mind, for, besides nourishing his heart with the hope of\r\ngetting ten ducats for a rotten, worn-out spinet, he was sitting before\r\na splendid, boldly-designed picture, the rare beauty of which he was\r\nquite capable of estimating at its full worth. And that he was in this\r\nhappy frame of mind he evidenced in divers way; he simpered most\r\ncharmingly; he half closed his little eyes; he assiduously stroked his\r\nchin and moustache; and lisped time after time, \"Splendid! delicious!\"\r\nbut they did not know to which he was referring, the picture or the\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nWhen he had thus worked himself round into a quiet cheerful humour,\r\nSalvator suddenly began--\"They tell me, my dear sir, that you have a\r\nmost beautiful and amiable niece, named Marianna--is it so? All the\r\nyoung men of the city are so smitten with love that they stupidly do\r\nnothing but run up and down the Via Ripetta, almost dislocating their\r\nnecks in their efforts to look up at your balcony for a sight of your\r\nsweet Marianna, to snatch a single glance from her heavenly eyes.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly all the charming simpers, all the good humour which had been\r\ncalled up into the old gentleman's face by the good wine, were gone.\r\nLooking gloomily before him, he said sharply, \"Ah! that's an instance\r\nof the corruption of our abandoned young men. They fix their infernal\r\neyes, there probate seducers, upon mere children. For I tell you, my\r\ngood sir, that my niece Marianna is quite a child, quite a child, only\r\njust outgrown her nurse's care.\"\r\n\r\nSalvator turned the conversation upon something else; the old gentleman\r\nrecovered himself. But just as he, his face again radiant with\r\nsunshine, was on the point of putting the full wine-cup to his lips,\r\nSalvator began anew. \"But pray tell me, my dear sir, if it is indeed\r\ntrue that your niece, with her sixteen summers, really has such\r\nbeautiful auburn hair, and eyes so full of heaven's own loveliness and\r\njoy, as has Antonio's 'Magdalene?' It is generally maintained that she\r\nhas.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" replied the old gentleman, still more sharply than\r\nbefore, \"I don't know. But let us leave my niece in peace; rather let\r\nus exchange a few instructive words on the noble subject of art, as\r\nyour fine picture here of itself invites me to do.\"\r\n\r\nAlways when Capuzzi raised the wine-cup to his lips to take a good\r\ndraught, Salvator began anew to talk about the beautiful Marianna, so\r\nthat at last the old gentleman leapt from his chair in a perfect\r\npassion, banged the cup down upon the table and almost broke it,\r\nscreaming in a high shrill voice, \"By the infernal pit of Pluto! by all\r\nthe furies! you will turn my wine into poison--into poison I tell you.\r\nBut I see through you, you and your fine friend Signor Antonio, you\r\nthink to make sport of me. But you'll find yourselves deceived Pay me\r\nthe ten ducats you owe me immediately, and then I will leave you and\r\nyour associate, that barber-fellow Antonio, to make your way to the\r\ndevil.\"\r\n\r\nSalvator shouted, as if mastered by the most violent rage, \"What! you\r\nhave the audacity to treat me in this way in my own house! Do you think\r\nI'm going to pay you ten ducats for that rotten box; the woodworms\r\nhave long ago eaten all the goodness and all the music out of it? Not\r\nten--not five--not three--not one ducat shall you have for it, it's\r\nscarcely worth a farthing. Away with the tumbledown thing!\" and he\r\nkicked over the little instrument again and again, till the strings\r\nwere all jarring and jangling together.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" screeched Capuzzi, \"justice is still to be had in Rome; I will\r\nhave you arrested, sir,--arrested and cast into the deepest dungeon\r\nthere is,\" and off he was rushing out of the room, blustering like a\r\nhailstorm. But Salvator took fast hold of him with both hands, and drew\r\nhim down into the chair again, softly murmuring in his ear, \"My dear\r\nSignor Pasquale, don't you perceive that I was only jesting with you?\r\nYou shall have for your spinet, not ten, but _thirty_ ducats cash\r\ndown.\" And he went on repeating, \"thirty bright ducats in ready money,\"\r\nuntil Capuzzi said in a faint and feeble voice, \"What do you say, my\r\ndear sir? Thirty ducats for the spinet without its being repaired?\"\r\nThen Salvator released his hold of the old gentleman, and asserted\r\non his honour that within an hour the instrument should be worth\r\nthirty--nay, forty ducats, and that Signor Pasquale should receive as\r\nmuch for it.\r\n\r\nTaking in a fresh supply of breath, and sighing deeply, the old\r\ngentleman murmured, \"Thirty--forty ducats!\" Then he began, \"But you\r\nhave greatly offended me, Signor Salvator\"---- \"Thirty ducats,\"\r\nrepeated Salvator. Capuzzi simpered, but then began again, \"But you\r\nhave grossly wounded my feelings, Signor Salvator\"---- \"Thirty ducats,\"\r\nexclaimed Salvator, cutting him short; and he continued to repeat,\r\n\"Thirty ducats! thirty ducats!\" as long as the old gentleman continued\r\nto sulk--till at length Capuzzi said, radiant with delight, \"If you\r\nwill give me thirty,--I mean forty ducats for the spinet, all shall be\r\nforgiven and forgotten, my dear sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" began Salvator, \"before I can fulfil my promise, I still have\r\none little condition to make, which you, my honoured Signor Pasquale\r\nCapuzzi di Senigaglia, can easily grant. You are the first musical\r\ncomposer in all Italy, besides being the foremost singer of the day.\r\nWhen I heard in the opera _Le Nozze di Teti e Peleo_ the great scene\r\nwhich that shameless Francesco Cavalli has thievishly taken from your\r\nworks, I was enraptured. If you would only sing me that aria whilst I\r\nput the spinet to rights you would confer upon me a pleasure than which\r\nI can conceive of none more enjoyable.\"\r\n\r\nPuckering up his mouth into the most winning of smiles, and blinking\r\nhis little grey eyes, the old gentleman replied, \"I perceive, my good\r\nsir, that you are yourself a clever musician, for you possess taste and\r\nknow how to value the deserving better than these ungrateful Romans.\r\nListen--listen--to the aria of all arias.\"\r\n\r\nTherewith he rose to his feet, and, stretching himself up to his full\r\nheight, spread out his arms and closed both eyes, so that he looked\r\nlike a cock preparing to crow; and he at once began to screech in such\r\na way that the walls rang again, and Dame Caterina and her two\r\ndaughters soon came running in, fully under the impression that such\r\nlamentable sounds must betoken some accident or other. At sight of the\r\ncrowing old gentleman they stopped on the threshold utterly astonished;\r\nand thus they formed the audience of the incomparable musician Capuzzi.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Salvator, having picked up the spinet and thrown back the\r\nlid, had taken his palette in hand, and in bold firm strokes had begun\r\non the lid of the instrument the most remarkable piece of painting that\r\never was seen. The central idea was a scene from Cavalli's opera _Le\r\nNozze di Teti_, but there was a multitude of other personages mixed up\r\nwith it in the most fantastic way. Amongst them were the recognisable\r\nfeatures of Capuzzi, Antonio, Marianna (faithfully reproduced from\r\nAntonio's picture), Salvator himself, Dame Caterina and her two\r\ndaughters,--and even the Pyramid Doctor was not wanting,--and all\r\ngrouped so intelligently, judiciously, and ingeniously, that Antonio\r\ncould not conceal his astonishment, both at the artist's intellectual\r\npower as well as at his technique.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile old Capuzzi had not been content with the aria which Salvator\r\nhad requested him to give, but, carried away by his musical madness, he\r\nwent on singing or rather screeching without intermission, working his\r\nway through the most awful recitatives from one execrable scene to\r\nanother. He must have been going on for nearly two hours when he sank\r\nback in his chair, breathless, and with his face as red as a cherry.\r\nAnd just at this same time also Salvator had so far worked out his\r\nsketch that the figures began to wear a look of vitality, and the\r\nwhole, viewed at a little distance, had the appearance of a finished\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"I have kept my word with respect to the spinet, my dear Signer\r\nPasquale,\" breathed Salvator in the old man's ear. He started up as if\r\nawakening out of a deep sleep. Immediately his glance fell upon the\r\npainted instrument, which stood directly opposite him. Then, opening\r\nhis eyes wide as if he saw a miracle, and jauntily throwing his conical\r\nhat on the top of his wig, he took his crutch-stick under his arm, made\r\none bound to the spinet, tore the lid off the hinges, and holding it\r\nabove his head, ran like a madman out of the room, down the stairs, and\r\naway, away out of the house altogether, followed by the hearty laughter\r\nof Dame Caterina and both her daughters.\r\n\r\n\"The old miser,\" said Salvator, \"knows very well that he has only to\r\ntake yon painted lid to Count Colonna or to my friend Rossi and he will\r\nat once get forty ducats for it, or even more.\"\r\n\r\nSalvator and Antonio then both deliberated how they should carry out\r\nthe plan of attack which was to be made when night came. We shall soon\r\nsee what the two adventurers resolved upon, and what success they had\r\nin their adventure.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was dark, Signer Pasquale, after locking and bolting the\r\ndoor of his house, carried the little monster of an eunuch home as\r\nusual. The whole way the little wretch was whining and growling,\r\ncomplaining that not only did he sing Capuzzi's arias till he got\r\ncatarrh in the throat and burn his fingers cooking the macaroni, but he\r\nhad now to lend himself to duties which brought him nothing but sharp\r\nboxes of the ear and rough kicks, which Marianna lavishly distributed\r\nto him as soon as ever he came near her. Old Capuzzi consoled him as\r\nwell as he could, promising to provide him an ampler supply of\r\nsweetmeats than he had hitherto done; indeed, as the little man would\r\nnohow cease his growling and querulous complaining, Pasquale even laid\r\nhimself under the obligation to get a natty abbot's coat made for the\r\nlittle torment out of an old black plush waistcoat which he (the dwarf)\r\nhad often set covetous eyes upon. He demanded a wig and a sword as\r\nwell. Parleying upon these points they arrived at the Via Bergognona,\r\nfor that was where Pitichinaccio dwelt, only four doors from Salvator.\r\n\r\nThe old man set the dwarf cautiously down and opened the street door;\r\nand then, the dwarf on in front, they both began to climb up the narrow\r\nstairs, which were more like a rickety ladder for hens and chickens\r\nthan steps for respectable people. But they had hardly mounted half way\r\nup when a terrible racket began up above, and the coarse voice of some\r\nwild drunken fellow was heard cursing and swearing, and demanding to be\r\nshown the way out of the damned house. Pitichinaccio squeezed himself\r\nclose to the wall, and entreated Capuzzi, in the name of all the\r\nsaints, to go on first. But before Capuzzi had ascended two steps, the\r\nfellow who was up above came tumbling headlong downstairs, caught hold\r\nof the old man, and whisked him away like a whirlwind out through\r\nthe open door below into the middle of the street. There they both\r\nlay,--Capuzzi at bottom and the drunken brute like a heavy sack on top\r\nof him. The old gentleman screamed piteously for help; two men came up\r\nat once and with considerable difficulty freed him from the heavy\r\nweight lying upon him; the other fellow, as soon as he was lifted up,\r\nreeled away cursing.\r\n\r\n\"Good God! what's happened to you, Signor Pasquale? What are you doing\r\nhere at this time of night? What big quarrel have you been getting\r\nmixed up in in that house there?\" thus asked Salvator and Antonio, for\r\nthat is who the two men were.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shall die!\" groaned Capuzzi; \"that son of the devil has crushed\r\nall my limbs; I can't move.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me look,\" said Antonio, feeling all over the old gentleman's body,\r\nand suddenly he pinched his right leg so sharply that Capuzzi screamed\r\nout aloud.\r\n\r\n\"By all the saints!\" cried Antonio in consternation, \"by all the\r\nsaints! my dear Signer Pasquale, you've broken your right leg in the\r\nmost dangerous place. If you don't get speedy help you will within a\r\nshort time be a dead man, or at any rate be lame all your life long.\"\r\n\r\nA terrible scream escaped the old man's breast. \"Calm yourself, my dear\r\nsir,\" continued Antonio, \"although I'm now a painter, I haven't\r\naltogether forgotten my surgical practice. We will carry you to\r\nSalvator's house and I will at once bind up\"----\r\n\r\n\"My dear Signor Antonio,\" whined Capuzzi, \"you nourish hostile feelings\r\ntowards me, I know.\" \"But,\" broke in Salvator, \"this is now no longer\r\nthe time to talk about enmity; you are in danger, and that is enough\r\nfor honest Antonio to exert all his skill on your behalf. Lay hold,\r\nfriend Antonio.\"\r\n\r\nGently and cautiously they lifted up the old man between them, him\r\nscreaming with the unspeakable pain caused by his broken leg, and\r\ncarried him to Salvator's dwelling.\r\n\r\nDame Caterina said that she had had a foreboding that something was\r\ngoing to happen, and so she had not gone to bed. As soon as she caught\r\nsight of the old gentleman and heard what had befallen him, she began\r\nto heap reproaches upon him for his bad conduct. \"I know,\" she said, \"I\r\nknow very well, Signor Pasquale, who you've been taking home again. Now\r\nthat you've got your beautiful niece Marianna in the house with you,\r\nyou think you've no further call to have women-folk about you, and you\r\ntreat that poor Pitichinaccio most shameful and infamous, putting him\r\nin petticoats. But look to it. _Ogni carne ha il suo osso_ (Every house\r\nhas its skeleton). Why if you have a girl about you, don't you need\r\nwomen-folk? _Fate il passo secondo la gamba_ (Cut your clothes\r\naccording to your cloth), and don't you require anything either more or\r\nless from your Marianna than what is right. Don't lock her up as if she\r\nwere a prisoner, nor make your house a dungeon. _Asino punto convien\r\nche trotti_ (If you are in the stream, you had better swim with it);\r\nyou have a beautiful niece and you must alter your ways to suit her,\r\nthat is, you must only do what she wants you to do. But you are an\r\nungallant and hard-hearted man, ay, and even in love, and jealous as\r\nwell, they say, which I hope at your years is not true. Your pardon for\r\ntelling you it all straight out, but _chi ha nel petto fiele non puo\r\nsputar miele_ (when there's bile in the heart there can't be honey in\r\nthe mouth). So now, if you don't die of your broken leg, which at your\r\ngreat age is not at all unlikely, let this be a warning to you; and\r\nleave your niece free to do what she likes, and let her marry the fine\r\nyoung gentleman as I know very well.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the stream went on uninterruptedly, whilst Salvator and Antonio\r\ncautiously undressed the old gentleman and put him to bed. Dame\r\nCaterina's words were like knives cutting deeply into his breast; but\r\nwhenever he attempted to intervene, Antonio signed to him that all\r\nspeaking was dangerous, and so he had to swallow his bitter gall. At\r\nlength Salvator sent Dame Caterina away, to fetch some ice-cold water\r\nthat Antonio wanted.\r\n\r\nSalvator and Antonio satisfied themselves that the fellow who had been\r\nsent to Pitichinaccio's house had done his duty well. Notwithstanding\r\nthe apparently terrible fall, Capuzzi had not received the slightest\r\ndamage beyond a slight bruise or two. Antonio put the old gentleman's\r\nright foot in splints and bandaged it up so tight that he could not\r\nmove. Then they wrapped him up in cloths that had been soaked in\r\nice-cold water, as a precaution, they alleged, against inflammation, so\r\nthat the old gentleman shook as if with the ague.\r\n\r\n\"My good Signor Antonio,\" he groaned feebly, \"tell me if it is all over\r\nwith me. Must I die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Compose yourself,\" replied Antonio. \"If you will only compose\r\nyourself, Signor Pasquale! As you have come through the first dressing\r\nwith so much nerve and without fainting, I think we may say that the\r\ndanger is past; but you will require the most attentive nursing. At\r\npresent we mustn't let you out of the doctor's sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Antonio,\" whined the old gentleman, \"you know how I like you,\r\nhow highly I esteem your talents. Don't leave me. Give me your dear\r\nhand--so! You won't leave me, will you, my dear good Antonio?\"\r\n\r\n\"Although I am now no longer a surgeon,\" said Antonio, \"although I've\r\nquite given up that hated trade, yet I will in your case, Signor\r\nPasquale, make an exception, and will undertake to attend you, for\r\nwhich I shall ask nothing except that you give me your friendship, your\r\nconfidence again. You were a little hard upon me\"----\r\n\r\n\"Say no more,\" lisped the old gentleman, \"not another word, my dear\r\nAntonio\"----\r\n\r\n\"Your niece will be half dead with anxiety,\" said Antonio again, \"at\r\nyour not returning home. You are, considering your condition, brisk and\r\nstrong enough, and so as soon as day dawns we'll carry you home to your\r\nown house. There I will again look at your bandage, and arrange your\r\nbed as it ought to be, and give your niece her instructions, so that\r\nyou may soon get well again.\"\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman heaved a deep sigh and closed his eyes, remaining\r\nsome minutes without speaking. Then, stretching out his hand towards\r\nAntonio, he drew him down close beside him, and whispered, \"It was only\r\na jest that you had with Marianna, was it not, my dear sir?--one of\r\nthose merry conceits that young folks have\"----\r\n\r\n\"Think no more about that, Signor Pasquale,\" replied Antonio. \"Your\r\nniece did, it is true, strike my fancy; but I have now quite different\r\nthings in my head, and--to confess honestly to it--I am very pleased\r\nthat you did return a sharp answer to my foolish suit. I thought I was\r\nin love with your Marianna, but what I really saw in her was only a\r\nfine model for my 'Magdalene.' And this probably explains how it is\r\nthat, now that my picture is finished, I feel quite indifferent towards\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Antonio,\" cried the old man, in a strong voice, \"Antonio, you glorious\r\nfellow! What comfort you give me--what help--what consolation! Now that\r\nyou don't love Marianna I feel as if all my pain had gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I declare, Signor Pasquale,\" said Salvator, \"if we didn't know\r\nyou to be a grave and sensible man, with a true perception of what is\r\nbecoming to your years, we might easily believe that you were yourself\r\nby some infatuation in love with your niece of sixteen summers.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the old gentleman closed his eyes, and groaned and moaned at the\r\nhorrible pain, which now returned with redoubled violence.\r\n\r\nThe first red streaks of morning came shining in through the window.\r\nAntonio announced to the old gentleman that it was now time to take him\r\nto his own house in the Via Ripetta. Signor Pasquale's reply was a deep\r\nand piteous sigh. Salvator and Antonio lifted him out of bed and\r\nwrapped him in a wide mantle which had belonged to Dame Caterina's\r\nhusband, and which she lent them for this purpose. The old gentleman\r\nimplored them by all the saints to take off the villainous cold\r\nbandages in which his bald head was swathed, and to give him his wig\r\nand plumed hat. And also, if it were possible, Antonio was to put his\r\nmoustache a little in order, that Marianna might not be too much\r\nfrightened at sight of him.\r\n\r\nTwo porters with a litter were standing all ready before the door. Dame\r\nCaterina, still storming at the old man, and mixing a great many\r\nproverbs in her abuse, carried down the bed, in which they then\r\ncarefully packed him; and so, accompanied by Salvator and Antonio, he\r\nwas taken home to his own house.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Marianna see her uncle in this wretched plight than she\r\nbegan to scream, whilst a torrent of tears gushed from her eyes;\r\nwithout noticing her lover, who had come along with him, she grasped\r\nthe old man's hands and pressed them to her lips, bewailing the\r\nterrible accident that had befallen him--so much pity had the good\r\nchild for the old man who plagued and tormented her with his amorous\r\nfolly. Yet at this same moment the inherent nature of woman asserted\r\nitself in her; for it only required a few significant glances from\r\nSalvator to put her in full possession of all the facts of the case.\r\nNow, for the first time, she stole a glance at the happy Antonio,\r\nblushing hotly as she did so; and a pretty sight it was to see how a\r\nroguish smile gradually routed and broke through her tears. Salvator,\r\nat any rate, despite the \"Magdalene,\" had not expected to find the\r\nlittle maiden half so charming, or so sweetly pretty as he now really\r\ndiscovered her to be; and, whilst almost feeling inclined to envy\r\nAntonio his good fortune, he felt that it was all the more necessary to\r\nget poor Marianna away from her hateful uncle, let the cost be what it\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nSignor Pasquale forgot his trouble in being received so affectionately\r\nby his lovely niece, which was indeed more than he deserved. He\r\nsimpered and pursed up his lips so that his moustache was all of a\r\ntotter, and groaned and whined, not with pain, but simply and solely\r\nwith amorous longing.\r\n\r\nAntonio arranged his bed professionally, and, after Capuzzi had been\r\nlaid on it, tightened the bandage still more, at the same time so\r\nmuffling up his left leg as well that he had to lay there motionless\r\nlike a log of wood. Salvator withdrew and left the lovers alone with\r\ntheir happiness.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman lay buried in cushions; moreover, as an extra\r\nprecaution, Antonio had bound a thick piece of cloth well steeped in\r\nwater round his head, so that he might not hear the lovers whispering\r\ntogether. This was the first time they unburdened all their hearts to\r\neach other, swearing eternal fidelity in the midst of tears and\r\nrapturous kisses. The old gentleman could have no idea of what was\r\ngoing on, for Marianna ceased not, frequently from time to time, to ask\r\nhim how he felt, and even permitted him to press her little white hand\r\nto his lips.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning began to be well advanced, Antonio hastened away to\r\nprocure, as he said, all the things that the old gentleman required,\r\nbut in reality to invent some means for putting him, at any rate for\r\nsome hours, in a still more helpless condition, as well as to consult\r\nwith Salvator what further steps were then to be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n_Of the new attack made by Salvator Rosa and Antonio Scacciati upon\r\nSigner Pasquale Capuzzi and upon his company, and of what further\r\nhappens in consequence._\r\n\r\nNext morning Antonio came to Salvator, melancholy and dejected.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's the matter?\" cried Salvator when he saw him coming, \"what\r\nare you hanging your head about? What's happened to you now, you happy\r\ndog? can you not see your mistress every day, and kiss her and press\r\nher to your heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Salvator, it's all over with my happiness, it's gone for ever,\"\r\ncried Antonio. \"The devil is making sport of me. Our stratagem has\r\nfailed, and we now stand on a footing of open enmity with that cursed\r\nCapuzzi.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" said Salvator; \"so much the better. But come,\r\nAntonio, tell me what's happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just imagine, Salvator,\" began Antonio, \"yesterday when I went back to\r\nthe Via Ripetta after an absence of at the most two hours, with all\r\nsorts of medicines, whom should I see but the old gentleman standing in\r\nhis own doorway fully dressed. Behind him was the Pyramid Doctor and\r\nthe deuced ex-gendarme, whilst a confused something was bobbing about\r\nround their legs. It was, I believe, that little monster Pitichinaccio.\r\nNo sooner did the old man get sight of me than he shook his fist at me,\r\nand began to heap the most fearful curses and imprecations upon me,\r\nswearing that if I did but approach his door he would have all my bones\r\nbroken. 'Be off to the devil, you infamous barber-fellow,' he shrieked;\r\n'you think to outwit me with your lying and knavery. Like the very\r\ndevil himself, you lie in wait for my poor innocent Marianna, and fancy\r\nyou are going to get her into your toils--but stop a moment! I will\r\nspend my last ducat to have the vital spark stamped out of you, ere\r\nyou're aware of it. And your fine patron, Signor Salvator, the\r\nmurderer--bandit--who's escaped the halter--he shall be sent to join\r\nhis captain Masaniello in hell--I'll have him out of Rome; that won't\r\ncost me much trouble.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus the old fellow raged, and as the damned ex-gendarme, incited by\r\nthe Pyramid Doctor, was making preparations to bear down upon me, and a\r\ncrowd of curious onlookers began to assemble, what could I do but quit\r\nthe field with all speed? I didn't like to come to you in my great\r\ntrouble, for I know you would only have laughed at me and my\r\ninconsolable complaints. Why, you can hardly keep back your laughter\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nAs Antonio ceased speaking, Salvator did indeed burst out laughing\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he cried, \"now the thing is beginning to be rather interesting.\r\nAnd now, my worthy Antonio, I will tell you in detail all that took\r\nplace at Capuzzi's after you had gone. You had hardly left the house\r\nwhen Signor Splendiano Accoramboni, who had learned--God knows in what\r\nway--that his bosom-friend, Capuzzi, had broken his right leg in the\r\nnight, drew near in all solemnity, with a surgeon. Your bandage and the\r\nentire method of treatment you have adopted with Signor Pasquale could\r\nnot fail to excite suspicion. The surgeon removed the splints and\r\nbandages, and they discovered, what we both very well know, that there\r\nwas not even so much as an ossicle of the worthy Capuzzi's right foot\r\ndislocated, still less broken. It didn't require any uncommon sagacity\r\nto understand all the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Antonio, utterly astonished, \"but my dear, good sir, do\r\ntell me how you have learned all that; tell me how you get into\r\nCapuzzi's house and know everything that takes place there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already told you,\" replied Salvator, \"that an acquaintance of\r\nDame Caterina lives in the same house, and moreover, on the same floor\r\nas Capuzzi. This acquaintance, the widow of a wine-dealer, has a\r\ndaughter whom my little Margaret often goes to see. Now girls have a\r\nspecial instinct for finding out their fellows, and so it came about\r\nthat Rose--that's the name of the wine-dealer's daughter--and Margaret\r\nsoon discovered in the living-room a small vent-hole, leading into a\r\ndark closet that adjoins Marianna's apartment. Marianna had been by no\r\nmeans inattentive to the whispering and murmuring of the two girls, nor\r\nhad she failed to notice the vent-hole, and so the way to a mutual\r\nexchange of communications was soon opened and made use of. Whenever\r\nold Capuzzi takes his afternoon nap the girls gossip away to their\r\nheart's content. You will have observed that little Margaret, Dame\r\nCaterina's and my favourite, is not so serious and reserved as her\r\nelder sister, Anna, but is an arch, frolicsome, droll little thing.\r\nWithout expressly making mention of your love-affair I have instructed\r\nher to get Marianna to tell her everything that takes place in\r\nCapuzzi's house. She has proved a very apt pupil in the matter; and if\r\nI laughed at your pain and despondency just now it was because I knew\r\nwhat would comfort you, knew I could prove to you that the affair has\r\nnow taken a most favourable turn. I have quite a big budget full of\r\nexcellent news for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Salvator!\" cried Antonio, his eyes sparkling with joy, \"how you cause\r\nmy hopes to rise! Heaven be praised for the vent-hole. I will write to\r\nMarianna; Margaret shall take the letter with her\"----\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay, we can have none of that, Antonio,\" replied Salvator.\r\n\"Margaret can be useful to us without being your love-messenger\r\nexactly. Besides, accident, which often plays many fine tricks, might\r\ncarry your amorous confessions into old Capuzzi's hands, and so bring\r\nan endless amount of fresh trouble upon Marianna, just at the very\r\nmoment when she is on the point of getting the lovesick old fool under\r\nher thumb. For listen to what then happened. The way in which Marianna\r\nreceived the old fellow when we took him home has quite reformed him.\r\nHe is fully convinced that she no longer loves you, but that she has\r\ngiven him at least one half of her heart, and that all he has to do is\r\nto win the other half. And Marianna, since she imbibed the poison of\r\nyour kisses, has advanced three years in shrewdness, artfulness, and\r\nexperience. She has convinced the old man, not only that she had no\r\nshare in our trick, but that she hates our goings-on, and will meet\r\nwith scorn every device on your part to approach her. In his excessive\r\ndelight the old man was too hasty, and swore that if he could do\r\nanything to please his adored Marianna he would do it immediately, she\r\nhad only to give utterance to her wish. Whereupon Marianna modestly\r\nasked for nothing except that her _zio carissimo_ (dearest uncle) would\r\ntake her to see Signor Formica in the theatre outside the Porta del\r\nPopolo. This rather posed Capuzzi; there were consultations with the\r\nPyramid Doctor and with Pitichinaccio; at last Signor Pasquale and\r\nSignor Splendiano came to the resolution that they really would take\r\nMarianna to this theatre to-morrow. Pitichinaccio, it was resolved,\r\nshould accompany them in the disguise of a handmaiden, to which he only\r\ngave his consent on condition that Signor Pasquale would make him a\r\npresent, not only of the plush waistcoat, but also of a wig, and at\r\nnight would, alternately with the Pyramid Doctor, carry him home. That\r\nbargain they finally made; and so the curious leash will certainly go\r\nalong with pretty Marianna to see Signor Formica to-morrow, in the\r\ntheatre outside the Porta del Popolo.\"\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to say who Signor Formica was, and what he had to\r\ndo with the theatre outside the Porta del Popolo.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Carnival in Rome, nothing is more sad than when the\r\ntheatre-managers have been unlucky in their choice of a musical\r\ncomposer, or when the first tenor at the Argentina theatre has lost\r\nhis voice on the way, or when the male prima donna[4.1] of the Valle\r\ntheatre is laid up with a cold,--in brief, when the chief source of\r\nrecreation which the Romans were hoping to find proves abortive, and\r\nthen comes Holy Thursday and all at once cuts off all the hopes which\r\nmight perhaps have been realized It was just after one of these unlucky\r\nCarnivals--almost before the strict fast-days were past, when a certain\r\nNicolo Musso opened a theatre outside the Porta del Popolo, where he\r\nstated his intention of putting nothing but light impromptu comic\r\nsketches on the boards. The advertisement was drawn up in an ingenious\r\nand witty style, and consequently the Romans formed a favourable\r\npreconception of Musso's enterprise; but independently of this they\r\nwould in their longing to still their dramatic hunger have greedily\r\nsnatched at any the poorest pabulum of this description. The interior\r\narrangements of the theatre, or rather of the small booth, did not say\r\nmuch for the pecuniary resources of the enterprising manager. There was\r\nno orchestra, nor were there boxes. Instead, a gallery was put up at\r\nthe back, where the arms of the house of Colonna were conspicuous--a\r\nsign that Count Colonna had taken Musso and his theatre under his\r\nespecial protection. A platform of slight elevation, covered with\r\ncarpets and hung round with curtains, which, according to the\r\nrequirements of the piece, had to represent a wood or a room or a\r\nstreet--this was the stage. Add to this that the spectators had to\r\ncontent themselves with hard uncomfortable wooden benches, and it was\r\nno wonder that Signor Musso's patrons on first entering were pretty\r\nloud in their grumblings at him for calling a paltry wooden booth a\r\ntheatre. But no sooner had the first two actors who appeared exchanged\r\na few words together than the attention of the audience was arrested;\r\nas the piece proceeded their interest took the form of applause, their\r\napplause grew to admiration, their admiration to the wildest pitch of\r\nenthusiastic excitement, which found vent in loud and continuous\r\nlaughter, clapping of hands, and screams of \"Bravo! Bravo!\"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed it would not have been very easy to find anything more\r\nperfect than these extemporised representations of Nicolo Musso; they\r\noverflowed with wit, humour, and genius, and lashed the follies of the\r\nday with an unsparing scourge. The audience were quite carried away by\r\nthe incomparable characterisation which distinguished all the actors,\r\nbut particularly by the inimitable mimicry of Pasquarello,[4.2] by his\r\nmarvellously natural imitations of the voice, gait, and postures of\r\nwell-known personages. By his inexhaustible humour, and the point and\r\nappositeness of his impromptus, he quite carried his audience away. The\r\nman who played the _rôle_ of Pasquarello, and who called himself Signor\r\nFormica, seemed to be animated by a spirit of singular originality;\r\noften there was something so strange in either tone or gesture, that\r\nthe audience, even in the midst of the most unrestrained burst of\r\nlaughter, felt a cold shiver run through them. He was excellently\r\nsupported by Dr. Gratiano,[4.3] who in pantomimic action, in voice, and\r\nin his talent for saying the most delightful things mixed up with\r\napparently the most extravagant nonsense, had perhaps no equal in the\r\nworld. This _rôle_ was played by an old Bolognese named Maria Agli.\r\nThus in a short time all educated Rome was seen hastening in a\r\ncontinuous stream to Nicolo Musso's little theatre outside the Porta\r\ndel Popolo, whilst Formica's name was on everybody's lips, and people\r\nshouted with wild enthusiasm, \"_Oh! Formica! Formica benedetto! Oh!\r\nFormicissimo!_\"--not only in the theatre but also in the streets. They\r\nregarded him as a supernatural visitant, and many an old lady who had\r\nsplit her sides with laughing in the theatre, would suddenly look grave\r\nand say solemnly, \"_Scherza coi fanti e lascia star santi_\" (Jest with\r\nchildren but let the saints alone), if anybody ventured to say the\r\nleast thing in disparagement of Formica's acting. This arose from the\r\nfact that outside the theatre Signor Formica was an inscrutable\r\nmystery. Never was he seen anywhere, and all efforts to discover traces\r\nof him were vain, whilst Nicolo Musso on his part maintained an\r\ninexorable silence respecting his retreat.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the theatre that Marianna was anxious to go to.\r\n\r\n\"Let us make a decisive onslaught upon our foes,\" said Salvator; \"we\r\ncouldn't have a finer opportunity than when they're returning home from\r\nthe theatre.\" Then he imparted to Antonio the details of a plan, which,\r\nthough appearing adventurous and daring, Antonio nevertheless embraced\r\nwith joy, since it held out to him a prospect that he should be able to\r\ncarry off his Marianna from the hated old Capuzzi. He also heard with\r\napprobation that Salvator was especially concerned to chastise the\r\nPyramid Doctor.\r\n\r\nWhen night came, Salvator and Antonio each took a guitar and went to\r\nthe Via Ripetta, where, with the express view of causing old Capuzzi\r\nannoyance, they complimented lovely Marianna with the finest serenade\r\nthat ever was heard. For Salvator played and sang in masterly style,\r\nwhilst Antonio, as far as the capabilities of his fine tenor would\r\nallow him, almost rivalled Odoardo Ceccarelli. Although Signor Pasquale\r\nappeared on the balcony and tried to silence the singers with abuse,\r\nhis neighbours, attracted to their windows by the good singing, shouted\r\nto him that he and his companions howled and screamed like so many cats\r\nand dogs, and yet he wouldn't listen to good music when it did come\r\ninto the street; he might just go inside and stop up his ears if he\r\ndidn't want to listen to good singing. And so Signor Pasquale had to\r\nbear nearly all night long the torture of hearing Salvator and Antonio\r\nsing songs which at one time were the sweetest of love-songs and at\r\nanother mocked at the folly of amorous old fools. They plainly saw\r\nMarianna standing at the window, notwithstanding that Signor Pasquale\r\nbesought her in the sweetest phrases and protestations not to expose\r\nherself to the noxious night air.\r\n\r\nNext evening the most remarkable company that ever was seen proceeded\r\ndown the Via Ripetta towards the Porta del Popolo. All eyes were turned\r\nupon them, and people asked each other if these were maskers left from\r\nthe Carnival. Signor Pasquale Capuzzi, spruce and smug, all elegance\r\nand politeness, wearing his gay Spanish suit well brushed, parading a\r\nnew yellow feather in his conical hat, and stepping along in shoes too\r\nlittle for him, as if he were walking amongst eggs, was leading pretty\r\nMarianna on his arm; her slender figure could not be seen, still less\r\nher face, since she was smothered up to an unusual extent in her veil\r\nand wraps. On the other side marched Doctor Splendiano Accoramboni in\r\nhis great wig, which covered the whole of his back, so that to look at\r\nhim from behind there appeared to be a huge head walking along on\r\ntwo little legs. Close behind Marianna, and almost clinging to her,\r\nwaddled the little monster Pitichinaccio, dressed in fiery red\r\npetticoats, and having his head covered all over in hideous fashion\r\nwith bright-coloured flowers.\r\n\r\nThis evening Signor Formica outdid himself even, and, what he had never\r\ndone before, introduced short songs into his performance, burlesquing\r\nthe style of certain well-known singers. Old Capuzzi's passion for the\r\nstage, which in his youth had almost amounted to infatuation, was now\r\nstirred up in him anew. In a rapture of delight he kissed Marianna's\r\nhand time after time, and protested that he would not miss an evening\r\nvisiting Nicolo Musso's theatre with her. Signor Formica he extolled to\r\nthe very skies, and joined hand and foot in the boisterous applause of\r\nthe rest of the spectators. Signor Splendiano was less satisfied, and\r\nkept continually admonishing Signor Capuzzi and lovely Marianna not to\r\nlaugh so immoderately. In a single breath he ran over the names of\r\ntwenty or more diseases which might arise from splitting the sides with\r\nlaughing. But neither Marianna nor Capuzzi heeded him in the least. As\r\nfor Pitichinaccio, he felt very uncomfortable. He had been obliged to\r\nsit behind the Pyramid Doctor, whose great wig completely overshadowed\r\nhim. Not a single thing could he see on the stage, nor any of the\r\nactors, and was, moreover, repeatedly bothered and annoyed by two\r\nforward women who had placed themselves near him. They called him a\r\ndear, comely little lady, and asked him if he was married, though to be\r\nsure, he was very young, and whether he had any children, who they dare\r\nbe bound were sweet little creatures, and so forth. The cold sweat\r\nstood in beads on poor Pitichinaccio's brow; he whined and whimpered,\r\nand cursed the day he was born.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the performance, Signor Pasquale waited until\r\nthe spectators had withdrawn from the theatre. The last light was\r\nextinguished just as Signor Splendiano had lit a small piece of a wax\r\ntorch at it; and then Capuzzi, with his worthy friends and Marianna,\r\nslowly and circumspectly set out on their return journey.\r\n\r\nPitichinaccio wept and screamed; Capuzzi, greatly to his vexation, had\r\nto take him on his left arm, whilst with the right he led Marianna.\r\nDoctor Splendiano showed the way with his miserable little bit of\r\ntorch, which only burned with difficulty, and even then in a feeble\r\nsort of a way, so that the wretched light it cast merely served to\r\nreveal to them the thick darkness of the night.\r\n\r\nWhilst they were still a good distance from the Porta del Popolo they\r\nall at once saw themselves surrounded by several tall figures closely\r\nenveloped in mantles. At this moment the torch was knocked out of the\r\nDoctor's hand, and went out on the ground. Capuzzi, as well as the\r\nDoctor, stood still without uttering a sound. Then, without their\r\nknowing where it came from, a pale reddish light fell upon the muffled\r\nfigures, and four grisly skulls riveted their hollow ghastly eyes upon\r\nthe Pyramid Doctor. \"Woe--woe--woe betide thee, Splendiano\r\nAccoramboni!\" thus the terrible spectres shrieked in deep, sepulchral\r\ntones. Then one of them wailed, \"Do you know me? do you know me,\r\nSplendiano? I am Cordier, the French painter, who was buried last week,\r\nand whom your medicaments brought to his grave.\" Then the second, \"Do\r\nyou know me, Splendiano? I am Küfner, the German painter, whom you\r\npoisoned with your infernal electuary.\" Then the third, \"Do you know\r\nme, Splendiano? I am Liers, the Fleming, whom you killed with your\r\npills, and whose brother you defrauded of a picture.\" Then the fourth,\r\n\"Do you know me, Splendiano? I am Ghigi, the Neapolitan painter,\r\nwhom you despatched with your powders.\" And lastly all four together,\r\n\"Woe--woe--woe upon thee, Splendiano Accoramboni, cursed Pyramid\r\nDoctor! We bid you come--come down to us beneath the earth.\r\nAway--away--away with you! Hallo! hallo!\" and so saying they threw\r\nthemselves upon the unfortunate Doctor, and, raising him in their\r\narms, whisked him away like a whirlwind.\r\n\r\nNow, although Signor Pasquale was a good deal overcome by terror, yet\r\nit is surprising with what remarkable promptitude he recovered courage\r\nso soon as he saw that it was only his friend Accoramboni with whom the\r\nspectres were concerned. Pitichinaccio had stuck his head, with the\r\nflower-bed that was on it, under Capuzzi's mantle, and clung so fast\r\nround his neck that all efforts to shake him off proved futile.\r\n\r\n\"Pluck up your spirits,\" Capuzzi exhorted Marianna, when nothing more\r\nwas to be seen of the spectres or of the Pyramid Doctor; \"pluck up your\r\nspirits, and come to me, my sweet little ducky bird! As for my worthy\r\nfriend Splendiano, it's all over with him. May St. Bernard, who also\r\nwas an able physician and gave many a man a lift on the road to\r\nhappiness, may he help him, if the revengeful painters whom he hastened\r\nto get to his Pyramid break his neck! But who'll sing the bass of my\r\ncanzonas now? And this booby, Pitichinaccio, is squeezing my throat so,\r\nthat, adding in the fright caused by Splendiano's abduction, I fear I\r\nshall not be able to produce a pure note for perhaps six weeks to come.\r\nDon't be alarmed, my Marianna, my darling! It's all over now.\"\r\n\r\nShe assured him that she had quite recovered from her alarm, and begged\r\nhim to let her walk alone without support, so that he could free\r\nhimself from his troublesome pet. But Signor Pasquale only took faster\r\nhold of her, saying that he wouldn't suffer her to leave his side a\r\nyard in that pitch darkness for anything in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the very same moment as Signor Pasquale, now at his ease again, was\r\nabout to proceed on his road, four frightful fiend-like figures rose up\r\njust in front of him as if out of the earth; they wore short flaring\r\nred mantles and fixed their keen glittering eyes upon him, at the same\r\ntime making horrible noises--yelling and whistling. \"Ugh! ugh! Pasquale\r\nCapuzzi! You cursed fool! You amorous old devil! We belong to your\r\nfraternity; we are the evil spirits of love, and have come to carry you\r\noff to hell--to hell-fire--you and your crony Pitichinaccio.\" Thus\r\nscreaming, the Satanic figures fell upon the old man. Capuzzi fell\r\nheavily to the ground and Pitichinaccio along with him, both raising a\r\nshrill piercing cry of distress and fear, like that of a whole troop of\r\ncudgelled asses.\r\n\r\nMarianna had meanwhile torn herself away from the old man and leapt\r\naside. Then one of the devils clasped her softly in his arms,\r\nwhispering the sweet glad words, \"O Marianna! my Marianna! At last\r\nwe've managed it! My friends will carry the old man a long, long way\r\nfrom here, whilst we seek a better place of safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"O my Antonio!\" whispered Marianna softly.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the scene was illuminated by the light of several torches,\r\nand Antonio felt a stab in his shoulder. Quick as lightning he turned\r\nround, drew his sword, and attacked the fellow, who with his stiletto\r\nupraised was just preparing to aim a second blow. He perceived that his\r\nthree companions were defending themselves against a superior number of\r\ngendarmes. He managed to beat off the fellow who had attacked him, and\r\njoined his friends. Although they were maintaining their ground\r\nbravely, the contest was yet too unequal; the gendarmes would\r\ninfallibly have proved victorious had not two others suddenly ranged\r\nthemselves with a shout on the side of the young men, one of them\r\nimmediately cutting down the fellow who was pressing Antonio the\r\nhardest.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more the contest was decided against the police.\r\nSeveral lay stretched on the ground seriously wounded; the rest fled\r\nwith loud shouts towards the Porta del Popolo.\r\n\r\nSalvator Rosa (for he it was who had hastened to Antonio's assistance\r\nand cut down his opponent) wanted to take Antonio and the young\r\npainters who were disguised in the devils' masks and there and then\r\npursue the gendarmes into the city.\r\n\r\nMaria Agli, however, who had come along with him, and, notwithstanding\r\nhis advanced age, had tackled the police as stoutly as any of the rest,\r\nurged that this would be imprudent, for the guard at the Porta del\r\nPopolo would be certain to have intelligence of the affair and would\r\narrest them. So they all betook themselves to Nicolo Musso, who gladly\r\nreceived them into his narrow little house not far from the theatre.\r\nThe artists took off their devils' masks and laid aside their mantles,\r\nwhich had been rubbed over with phosphorus, whilst Antonio, who,\r\nbeyond the insignificant scratch on his shoulder, was not wounded\r\nat all, exercised his surgical skill in binding up the wounds of the\r\nrest--Salvator, Agli, and his young comrades--for they had none of them\r\ngot off without being wounded, though none of them in the least degree\r\ndangerously.\r\n\r\nThe adventure, notwithstanding its wildness and audacity, would\r\nundoubtedly have been successful, had not Salvator and Antonio\r\noverlooked one person, who upset everything. The _ci-devant_ bravo and\r\ngendarme Michele, who dwelt below in Capuzzi's house, and was in a\r\ncertain sort his general servant, had, in accordance with Capuzzi's\r\ndirections, followed them to the theatre, but at some distance off, for\r\nthe old gentleman was ashamed of the tattered reprobate. In the same\r\nway Michele was following them homewards. And when the spectres\r\nappeared, Michele who, be it remarked, feared neither death nor devil,\r\nsuspecting that something was wrong, hurried back as fast as he could\r\nrun in the darkness to the Porta del Popolo, raised an alarm, and\r\nreturned with all the gendarmes he could find, just at the moment when,\r\nas we know, the devils fell upon Signor Pasquale, and were about to\r\ncarry him off as the dead men had the Pyramid Doctor.\r\n\r\nIn the very hottest moment of the fight, one of the young painters\r\nobserved distinctly how one of the fellows, taking Marianna in his arms\r\n(for she had fainted), made off to the gate, whilst Signor Pasquale ran\r\nafter him with incredible swiftness, as if he had got quicksilver in\r\nhis legs. At the same time, by the light of the torches, he caught a\r\nglimpse of something gleaming, clinging to his mantle and whimpering;\r\nno doubt it was Pitichinaccio.\r\n\r\nNext morning Doctor Splendiano was found near the Pyramid of Cestius,\r\nfast asleep, doubled up like a ball and squeezed into his wig, as if\r\ninto a warm soft nest. When he was awakened, he rambled in his talk,\r\nand there was some difficulty in convincing him that he was still on\r\nthe surface of the earth, and in Rome to boot. And when at length he\r\nreached his own house, he returned thanks to the Virgin and all the\r\nsaints for his rescue, threw all his tinctures, essences, electuaries,\r\nand powders out of the window, burnt his prescriptions, and vowed to\r\nheal his patients in the future by no other means than by anointing and\r\nlaying on of hands, as some celebrated physician of former ages, who\r\nwas at the same time a saint (his name I cannot recall just at this\r\nmoment), had with great success done before him. For his patients died\r\nas well as the patients of other people, and then they already saw the\r\ngates of heaven open before them ere they died, and in fact everything\r\nelse that the saint wanted them to see.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you,\" said Antonio next day to Salvator, \"how my heart\r\nboils with rage since my blood has been spilled. Death and destruction\r\novertake that villain Capuzzi! I tell you, Salvator, that I am\r\ndetermined to _force_ my way into his house. I will cut him down if he\r\nopposes me and carry off Marianna.\"\r\n\r\n\"An excellent plan!\" replied Salvator, laughing. \"An excellent plan!\r\nSplendidly contrived! Of course I presume you have also found some\r\nmeans for transporting Marianna through the air to the Spanish Square,\r\nso that they shall not seize you and hang you before you can reach that\r\nplace of refuge. No, my dear Antonio, violence can do nothing for you\r\nthis time. You may lay your life on it too that Signor Pasquale will\r\nnow take steps to guard against any open attack. Moreover, our\r\nadventure has made a good deal of noise, and the irrepressible laughter\r\nof the people at the absurd way in which we have read a lesson to\r\nSplendiano and Capuzzi has roused the police out of their light\r\nslumber, and they, you may be sure, will now exert all their feeble\r\nefforts to entrap us. No, Antonio, let us have recourse to craft. _Con\r\narte e con inganno si vive mezzo l'anno, con inganno e con arte si vive\r\nl'altra parte_ (If cunning and scheming will help us six months\r\nthrough, scheming and cunning will help us the other six too), says\r\nDame Caterina, nor is she far wrong. Besides, I can't help laughing to\r\nsee how we've gone and acted for all the world like thoughtless boys,\r\nand I shall have to bear most of the blame, for I am a good bit older\r\nthan you. Tell me now, Antonio, supposing our scheme had been\r\nsuccessful, and you had actually carried off Marianna from the old man,\r\nwhere would you have fled to, where would you have hidden her, and how\r\nwould you have managed to get united to her by the priest before the\r\nold man could interfere to prevent it? You shall, however, in a few\r\ndays, really and truly run away with your Marianna. I have let Nicolo\r\nMusso as well as Signor Formica into all the secret, and in common with\r\nthem devised a plan which can scarcely fail. So cheer up, Antonio;\r\nSignor Formica will help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor Formica?\" replied Antonio in a tone of indifference which\r\nalmost amounted to contempt. \"Signor Formica! In what way can that\r\nbuffoon help me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" laughed Salvator. \"Please to bear in mind, I beg you, that\r\nSignor Formica is worthy of your respect. Don't you know that he is a\r\nsort of magician who in secret is master of the most mysterious arts? I\r\ntell you, Signor Formica will help you. Old Maria Agli, the clever\r\nBolognese Doctor Gratiano, is also a sharer in the plot, and will,\r\nmoreover, have an important part to play in it. You shall abduct your\r\nMarianna, Antonio, from Musso's theatre.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are flattering me with false hopes, Salvator,\" said Antonio. \"You\r\nhave just now said yourself that Signor Pasquale will take care to\r\navoid all open attacks. How can you suppose then, after his recent\r\nunpleasant experience, that he can possibly make up his mind to visit\r\nMusso's theatre again?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not be such a difficult thing as you imagine to entice the old\r\nman there,\" replied Salvator. \"What will be more difficult to effect,\r\nwill be, to get him in the theatre without his satellites. But, be that\r\nas it may, what you have now got to do, Antonio, is to have everything\r\nprepared and arranged with Marianna, so as to flee from Rome the moment\r\nthe favourable opportunity comes. You must go to Florence; your skill\r\nas a painter will, after your arrival, in itself recommend you there;\r\nand you shall have no lack of acquaintances, nor of honourable\r\npatronage and assistance--that you may leave to me to provide for.\r\nAfter we have had a few days' rest, we will then see what is to be done\r\nfurther. Once more, Antonio--live in hope; Formica will help you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  V.\r\n\r\n_Of the new mishap which befalls Signor Pasquale Capussi. Antonio\r\nScacciati successfully carries out his plan in Nicolo Musso's theatre,\r\nand flees to Florence._\r\n\r\nSignor Pasquale was only too well aware who had been at the bottom of\r\nthe mischief that had happened to him and the poor Pyramid Doctor near\r\nthe Porta del Popolo, and so it may be imagined how enraged he was\r\nagainst Antonio, and against Salvator Rosa, whom he rightly judged to\r\nbe the ringleader in it all. He was untiring in his efforts to comfort\r\npoor Marianna, who was quite ill from fear,--so she said; but in\r\nreality she was mortified that the scoundrel Michele with his gendarmes\r\nhad come up, and torn her from her Antonio's arms. Meanwhile Margaret\r\nwas very active in bringing her tidings of her lover; and she based all\r\nher hopes upon the enterprising mind of Salvator. With impatience she\r\nwaited from day to day for something fresh to happen, and by a thousand\r\npetty tormenting ways let the old gentleman feel the effects of this\r\nimpatience; but though she thus tamed his amorous folly and made him\r\nhumble enough, she failed to reach the evil spirit of love that haunted\r\nhis heart. After she had made him experience to the full all the\r\ntricksy humours of the most wayward girl, and then suffered him just\r\nonce to press his withered lips upon her tiny hand, he would swear in\r\nhis excessive delight that he would never cease fervently kissing the\r\nPope's toe until he had obtained dispensation to wed his niece, the\r\nparagon of beauty and amiability. Marianna was particularly careful not\r\nto interrupt him in these outbreaks of passion, for by encouraging\r\nthese gleams of hope in the old man's breast she fanned the flame of\r\nhope in her own, for the more he could be lulled into the belief that\r\nhe held her fast in the indissoluble chains of love, the more easy it\r\nwould be for her to escape him.\r\n\r\nSome time passed, when one day at noon Michele came stamping upstairs,\r\nand, after he had had to knock a good many times to induce Signor\r\nPasquale to open the door, announced with considerable prolixity that\r\nthere was a gentleman below who urgently requested to see Signor\r\nPasquale Capuzzi, who he knew lived there.\r\n\r\n\"By all the blessed saints of Heaven!\" cried the old gentleman,\r\nexasperated; \"doesn't the knave know that on no account do I receive\r\nstrangers in my own house?\"\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman was of very respectable appearance, reported Michele,\r\nrather oldish, talked well, and called himself Nicolo Musso.\r\n\r\n\"Nicolo Musso,\" murmured Capuzzi reflectively; \"Nicolo Musso, who owns\r\nthe theatre beyond the Porta del Popolo; what can he want with me?\"\r\nWhereupon, carefully locking and bolting the door, he went downstairs\r\nwith Michele, in order to converse with Nicolo in the street before the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Signor Pasquale,\" began Nicolo, approaching to meet him, and\r\nbowing with polished ease, \"that you deign to honour me with your\r\nacquaintance affords me great pleasure. You lay me under a very great\r\nobligation. Since the Romans saw you in my theatre--you, a man of the\r\nmost approved taste, of the soundest knowledge, and a master in art,\r\nnot only has my fame increased, but my receipts have doubled. I am\r\ntherefore all the more deeply pained to learn that certain wicked\r\nwanton boys made a murderous attack upon you and your friends as you\r\nwere returning from my theatre at night. But I pray you, Signor\r\nPasquale, by all the saints, don't cherish any grudge against me or my\r\ntheatre on account of this outrage, which shall be severely punished.\r\nDon't deprive me of the honour of your company at my performances!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Signor Nicolo,\" replied the old man, simpering, \"be assured\r\nthat I never enjoyed myself more than I did when I visited your\r\ntheatre. Your Formica and your Agli--why, they are actors who cannot be\r\nmatched anywhere. But the fright almost killed my friend Signor\r\nSplendiano Accoramboni, nay, it almost proved the death of me--no, it\r\nwas too great; and though it has not made me averse from your theatre,\r\nit certainly has from the road there. If you will put up your theatre\r\nin the Piazza del Popolo, or in the Via Babuina, or in the Via Ripetta,\r\nI certainly will not fail to visit you a single evening; but there's\r\nno power on earth shall ever get me outside the Porta del Popolo at\r\nnight-time again.\"\r\n\r\nNicolo sighed deeply, as if greatly troubled. \"That is very hard upon\r\nme,\" said he then, \"harder perhaps than you will believe, Signor\r\nPasquale. For unfortunately--I had based all my hopes upon you. I came\r\nto solicit your assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"My assistance?\" asked the old gentleman in astonishment \"My\r\nassistance, Signor Nicolo? In what way could it profit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Signor Pasquale,\" replied Nicolo, drawing his handkerchief\r\nacross his eyes, as if brushing away the trickling tears, \"my most\r\nexcellent Signor Pasquale, you will remember that my actors are in the\r\nhabit of interspersing songs through their performances. This practice\r\nI was thinking of extending imperceptibly more and more, then to get\r\ntogether an orchestra, and, in a word, at last, eluding all\r\nprohibitions to the contrary, to establish an opera-house. You, Signor\r\nCapuzzi, are the first composer in all Italy; and we can attribute it\r\nto nothing but the inconceivable frivolity of the Romans and the\r\nmalicious envy of your rivals that we hear anything else but your\r\npieces exclusively at all the theatres. Signor Pasquale, I came to\r\nrequest you on my bended knees to allow me to put your immortal works,\r\nas far as circumstances will admit, on my humble stage.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Signor Nicolo,\" said the old gentleman, his face all sunshine,\r\n\"what are we about to be talking here in the public street? Pray deign\r\nto have the goodness to climb up one or two rather steep flights of\r\nstairs. Come along with me up to my poor dwelling.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost before Nicolo got into the room, the old gentleman brought\r\nforward a great pile of dusty music manuscript, opened it, and, taking\r\nhis guitar in his hands, began to deliver himself of a series of\r\nfrightful high-pitched screams which he denominated singing.\r\n\r\nNicolo behaved like one in raptures. He sighed; he uttered extravagant\r\nexpressions of approval; he exclaimed at intervals, \"_Bravo!\r\nBravissimo! Benedettissimo Capuzzi!_\" until at last he threw himself at\r\nthe old man's feet as if utterly beside himself with ecstatic delight,\r\nand grasped his knees. But he nipped them so hard that the old\r\ngentleman jumped off his seat, calling out with pain, and saying to\r\nNicolo, \"By the saints! Let me go, Signor Nicolo; you'll kill me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" replied Nicolo, \"nay, Signor Pasquale, I will not rise until\r\nyou have promised that Formica may sing in my theatre the day after\r\nto-morrow the divine arias which you have just executed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a man of taste,\" groaned Pasquale,--\"a man of deep insight. To\r\nwhom could I better intrust my compositions than to you? You shall take\r\nall my arias with you. Only let me go. But, good God! I shall not hear\r\nthem--my divine masterpieces! Oh! let me go, Signor Nicolo.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" cried Nicolo, still on his knees, and tightly pressing the old\r\ngentleman's thin spindle-shanks together, \"no, Signor Pasquale, I will\r\nnot let you go until you give me your word that you will be present in\r\nmy theatre the night after to-morrow. You need not fear any new attack!\r\nWhy, don't you think that the Romans, once they have heard your work,\r\nwill bring you home in triumph by the light of hundreds of torches? But\r\nin case that does not happen, I myself and my faithful comrades will\r\ntake our arms and accompany you home ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"You yourself will accompany me home, with your comrades?\" asked\r\nPasquale; \"and how many may that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight or ten persons will be at your command, Signor Pasquale. Do\r\nyield to my intercession and resolve to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Formica has a fine voice,\" lisped Pasquale. \"How finely he will\r\nexecute my arias.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do come, oh! do come!\" exhorted Nicolo again, giving the old\r\ngentleman's knees an extra grip.\r\n\r\n\"You will pledge yourself that I shall reach my own house without being\r\nmolested?\" asked the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"I pledge my honour and my life,\" was Nicolo's reply, as he gave the\r\nknees a still sharper grip.\r\n\r\n\"Agreed!\" cried the old gentleman; \"I will be in your theatre the day\r\nafter to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThen Nicolo leapt to his feet and pressed Pasquale in so close an\r\nembrace that he gasped and panted quite out of breath.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Marianna entered the room. Signor Pasquale tried to\r\nfrighten her away again by the look of resentment which he hurled at\r\nher; she, however, took not the slightest notice of it, but going\r\nstraight up to Musso, addressed him as if in anger,--\"It is in vain for\r\nyou, Signor Nicolo, to attempt to entice my dear uncle to go to your\r\ntheatre. You are forgetting that the infamous trick lately played by\r\nsome reprobate seducers, who were lying in wait for me, almost cost the\r\nlife of my dearly beloved uncle, and of his worthy friend Splendiano;\r\nnay, that it almost cost my life too. Never will I give my consent to\r\nmy uncle's again exposing himself to such danger. Desist from your\r\nentreaties, Nicolo. And you, my dearest uncle, you will stay quietly at\r\nhome, will you not, and not venture out beyond the Porta del Popolo\r\nagain at night-time, which is a friend to nobody?\"\r\n\r\nSignor Pasquale was thunderstruck. He opened his eyes wide and stared\r\nat his niece. Then he rewarded her with the sweetest endearments, and\r\nset forth at considerable length how that Signor Nicolo had pledged\r\nhimself so to arrange matters as to avoid every danger on the return\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\"None the less,\" said Marianna, \"I stick to my word, and beg you most\r\nearnestly, my dearest uncle, not to go to the theatre outside the Porta\r\ndel Popolo. I ask your pardon, Signor Nicolo, for speaking out frankly\r\nin your presence the dark suspicion that lurks in my mind. You are, I\r\nknow, acquainted with Salvator Rosa and also with Antonio Scacciati.\r\nWhat if you are acting in concert with our enemies? What if you are\r\nonly trying with evil intent to entice my dear uncle into your theatre\r\nin order that they may the more safely carry out some fresh villainous\r\nscheme, for I know that my uncle will not go without me?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a suspicion!\" cried Nicolo, quite alarmed. \"What a terrible\r\nsuspicion, Signora! Have you such a bad opinion of me? Have I such an\r\nill reputation that you conceive I could be guilty of this the basest\r\ntreachery? But if you think so unfavourably of me, if you mistrust the\r\nassistance I have promised you, why then let Michele, who I know\r\nrescued you out of the hands of the robbers--let Michele accompany you,\r\nand let him take a large body of gendarmes with him, who can wait for\r\nyou outside the theatre, for you cannot of course expect me to fill my\r\nauditorium with police.\"\r\n\r\nMarianna fixed her eyes steadily upon Nicolo's, and then said,\r\nearnestly and gravely, \"What do you say? That Michele and gendarmes\r\nshall accompany us? Now I see plainly, Signor Nicolo, that you mean\r\nhonestly by us, and that my nasty suspicion is unfounded. Pray forgive\r\nme my thoughtless words. And yet I cannot banish my nervousness and\r\nanxiety about my dear uncle; I must still beg him not to take this\r\ndangerous step.\"\r\n\r\nSignor Pasquale had listened to all this conversation with such curious\r\nlooks as plainly served to indicate the nature of the struggle that was\r\ngoing on within him. But now he could no longer contain himself; he\r\nthrew himself on his knees before his beautiful niece, seized her\r\nhands, kissed them, bathed them with the tears which ran down his\r\ncheeks, exclaiming as if beside himself, \"My adored, my angelic\r\nMarianna! Fierce and devouring are the flames of the passion which\r\nburns at my heart Oh! this nervousness, this anxiety--it is indeed the\r\nsweetest confession that you love me.\" And then he besought her not to\r\ngive way to fear, but to go and listen in the theatre to the finest\r\narias which the most divine of composers had ever written.\r\n\r\nNicolo too abated not in his entreaties, plainly showing his\r\ndisappointment, until Marianna permitted her scruples to be overcome;\r\nand she promised to lay all fear aside and accompany the best and\r\ndearest of uncles to the theatre outside the Porta del Popolo. Signor\r\nPasquale was in ectasies, was in the seventh heaven of delight. He was\r\nconvinced that Marianna loved him; and he now might hope to hear his\r\nmusic on the stage, and win the laurel wreath which had so long been\r\nthe vain object of his desires; he was on the point of seeing his\r\ndearest dreams fulfilled. Now he would let his light shine in perfect\r\nglory before his true and faithful friends, for he never thought for a\r\nmoment but that Signor Splendiano and little Pitichinaccio would go\r\nwith him as on the first occasion.\r\n\r\nThe night that Signor Splendiano had slept in his wig near the Pyramid\r\nof Cestius he had had, besides the spectres who ran away with him, all\r\nsorts of sinister apparitions to visit him. The whole cemetery was\r\nalive, and hundreds of corpses had stretched out their skeleton arms\r\ntowards him, moaning and wailing that even in their graves they could\r\nnot get over the torture caused by his essences and electuaries.\r\nAccordingly the Pyramid Doctor, although he could not contradict Signor\r\nPasquale that it was only a wild freakish trick played upon him by a\r\nparcel of godless boys, grew melancholy; and, albeit not ordinarily\r\nsuperstitiously inclined, he yet now saw spectres everywhere, and was\r\ntormented by forebodings and bad dreams.\r\n\r\nAs for Pitichinaccio, he could not be convinced that they were not real\r\ndevils come straight from the flames of hell who had fallen upon Signor\r\nPasquale and upon himself, and the bare mention of that dreadful night\r\nwas enough to make him scream. All the asseverations of Signor Pasquale\r\nthat there had been nobody behind the masks but Antonio Scacciati and\r\nSalvator Rosa were of none effect, for Pitichinaccio wept and swore\r\nthat in spite of his terror and apprehension he had clearly recognised\r\nboth the voice and the behaviour of the devil Fanfarelli in the one who\r\nhad pinched his belly black and blue.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore be imagined what an almost endless amount of trouble\r\nit cost Signor Pasquale to persuade the two to go with him once more to\r\nNicolo Musso's theatre. Splendiano was the first to make the resolve to\r\ngo,--after he had procured from a monk of St. Bernard's order a small\r\nconsecrated bag of musk, the perfume of which neither dead man nor\r\ndevil could endure; with this he intended to arm himself against all\r\nassaults. Pitichinaccio could not resist the temptation of a promised\r\nbox of candied grapes, but Signor Pasquale had besides expressly to\r\ngive his consent that he might wear his new abbot's coat, instead of\r\nhis petticoats, which he affirmed had proved an immediate source of\r\nattraction to the devil.\r\n\r\nWhat Salvator feared seemed therefore as if it would really take place;\r\nand yet his plan depended entirely, he continued to repeat, upon Signor\r\nPasquale's being in Nicolo's theatre alone with Marianna, without his\r\nfaithful satellites. Both Antonio and Salvator greatly racked their\r\nbrains how they should prevent Splendiano and Pitichinaccio from going\r\nalong with Signor Pasquale. Every scheme that occurred to them for the\r\naccomplishment of this desideratum had to be given up owing to want of\r\ntime, for the principal plan in Nicolo's theatre had to be carried out\r\non the evening of the following day.\r\n\r\nBut Providence, which often employs the most unlikely instruments for\r\nthe chastisement of fools, interposed on behalf of the distressed\r\nlovers, and put it into Michele's head to practise some of his\r\nblundering, thus accomplishing what Salvator and Antonio's craft was\r\nunable to accomplish.\r\n\r\nThat same night there was heard in the Via Ripetta before Signor\r\nPasquale's house such a chorus of fearful screams and of cursing and\r\nraving and abuse that all the neighbours were startled up out of their\r\nsleep, and a body of gendarmes, who had been pursuing a murderer as far\r\nas the Spanish Square, hastened up with torches, supposing that some\r\nfresh deed of violence was being committed. But when they, and a crowd\r\nof other people whom the noise had attracted, came upon the anticipated\r\nscene of murder, they found poor little Pitichinaccio lying as if dead\r\non the ground, whilst Michele was thrashing the Pyramid Doctor with a\r\nformidable bludgeon. And they saw the Doctor reel to the floor just at\r\nthe moment when Signor Pasquale painfully scrambled to his feet, drew\r\nhis rapier, and furiously attacked Michele. Round about were lying\r\npieces of broken guitars. Had not several people grasped the old man's\r\narm he would assuredly have run Michele right through the heart. The\r\nex-bravo, on now becoming aware by the light of the torches whom he had\r\nbeen molesting, stood as if petrified, his eyes almost starting out of\r\nhis heady \"a painted desperado, on the balance between will and power,\"\r\nas it is said somewhere. Then, uttering a fearful scream, he tore his\r\nhair and begged for pardon and mercy. Neither the Pyramid Doctor nor\r\nPitichinaccio was seriously injured, but they had been so soundly\r\ncudgelled that they could neither move nor stir, and had to be carried\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nSignor Pasquale had himself brought this mishap upon his own shoulders.\r\n\r\nWe know that Salvator and Antonio complimented Marianna with the finest\r\nserenade that could be heard; but I have forgotten to say that to the\r\nold gentleman's very exceeding indignation they repeated it during\r\nseveral successive nights. At length Signor Pasquale whose rage was\r\nkept in check by his neighbours, was foolish enough to have recourse to\r\nthe authorities of the city, urging them to forbid the two painters to\r\nsing in the Via Ripetta. The authorities, however, replied that it\r\nwould be a thing unheard of in Rome to prevent anybody from singing and\r\nplaying the guitar where he pleased, and it was irrational to ask such\r\na thing. So Signor Pasquale determined to put an end to the nuisance\r\nhimself, and promised Michele a large reward if he seized the first\r\nopportunity to fall upon the singers and give them a good sound\r\ndrubbing. Michele at once procured a stout bludgeon, and lay in wait\r\nevery night behind the door. But it happened that Salvator and Antonio\r\njudged it prudent to omit their serenading in the Via Ripetta for some\r\nnights preceding the carrying into execution of their plan, so as not\r\nto remind the old gentleman of his adversaries. Marianna remarked quite\r\ninnocently that though she hated Antonio and Salvator, yet she liked\r\ntheir singing, for nothing was so nice as to hear music floating\r\nupwards in the night air.\r\n\r\nThis Signor Pasquale made a mental note of, and as the essence of\r\ngallantry purposed to surprise his love with a serenade on his part,\r\nwhich he had himself composed and carefully practised up with his\r\nfaithful friends. On the very night preceding that in which he was\r\nhoping to celebrate his greatest triumph in Nicolo Musso's theatre, he\r\nstealthily slipped out of the house and went and fetched his\r\nassociates, with whom he had previously arranged matters. But no sooner\r\nhad they sounded the first few notes on their guitars than Michele,\r\nwhom Signor Pasquale had thoughtlessly forgotten to apprise of his\r\ndesign, burst forth from behind the door, highly delighted at finding\r\nthat the opportunity which was to bring him in the promised reward had\r\nat last come, and began to cudgel the musicians most unmercifully, with\r\nthe results of which we are already acquainted. Of course there was no\r\nfurther mention made of either Splendiano or Pitichinaccio's\r\naccompanying Signor Pasquale to Nicolo's theatre, for they were both\r\nconfined to their bed beplastered all over. Signor Pasquale, however,\r\nwas unable to stay away, although his back and shoulders were smarting\r\nnot a little from the drubbing he had himself received; every note in\r\nhis arias was a cord which drew him thither with irresistible power.\r\n\r\n\"Well now,\" said Salvator to Antonio, \"since the obstacle which we took\r\nto be insurmountable has been removed out of our way of itself, it all\r\ndepends now entirely upon your address not to let the favourable moment\r\nslip for carrying off your Marianna from Nicolo's theatre. But I\r\nneedn't talk, you'll not fail; I will greet you now as the betrothed of\r\nCapuzzi's lovely niece, who in a few days will be your wife. I wish you\r\nhappiness, Antonio, and yet I feel a shiver run through me when I think\r\nupon your marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Salvator?\" asked Antonio, utterly astounded.\r\n\r\n\"Call it a crotchet, call it a foolish fancy, or what you will,\r\nAntonio,\" rejoined Salvator,--\"at any rate I love the fair sex; but\r\nthere is not one, not even she on whom I foolishly dote, for whom I\r\nwould gladly die, but what excites in my heart, so soon as I think of a\r\nunion with her such as marriage is, a suspicion that makes me tremble\r\nwith a most unpleasant feeling of awe. That which is inscrutable in the\r\nnature of woman mocks all the weapons of man. She whom we believe to\r\nhave surrendered herself to us entirely, heart and soul, whom we\r\nbelieve to have unfolded all her character to us, is the first to\r\ndeceive us, and along with the sweetest of her kisses we imbibe the\r\nmost pernicious of poisons.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my Marianna?\" asked Antonio, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Antonio,\" continued Salvator, \"even your Marianna, who is\r\nloveliness and grace personified, has given me a fresh proof of how\r\ndangerous the mysterious nature of woman is to us. Just call to mind\r\nwhat was the behavior of that innocent, inexperienced child when we\r\ncarried her uncle home, how at a single glance from me she divined\r\neverything--everything, I tell you, and, as you yourself admitted,\r\nproceeded to play her part with the utmost sagacity. But that is not to\r\nbe at all compared with what took place on the occasion of Musso's\r\nvisit to the old gentleman. The most practised address, the most\r\nimpenetrable cunning,--in short, all the inventive arts of the most\r\nexperienced woman of the world could not have done more than little\r\nMarianna did, in order to deceive the old gentleman with perfect\r\nsuccess. She could not have acted in any better way to prepare the\r\nroad for us for any kind of enterprise. Our feud with the cranky old\r\nfool--any sort of cunning scheme seems justified, but--come, my dear\r\nAntonio, never mind my fanciful crotchets, but be happy with your\r\nMarianna; as happy as you can.\"\r\n\r\nIf a monk had taken his place beside Signor Pasquale when he set out\r\nalong with his niece to go to Nicolo Musso's theatre, everybody would\r\nhave thought that the strange pair were being led to execution. First\r\nwent valiant Michele, repulsive in appearance, and armed to the teeth;\r\nthen came Signor Pasquale and Marianna, followed by fully twenty\r\ngendarmes.\r\n\r\nNicolo received the old gentleman and his lady with every mark of\r\nrespect at the entrance to the theatre, and conducted them to the seats\r\nwhich had been reserved for them, immediately in front of the stage.\r\nSignor Pasquale felt highly flattered by this mark of honour, and gazed\r\nabout him with proud and sparkling eyes, whilst his pleasure, his\r\njoy, was greatly enhanced to find that all the seats near and behind\r\nMarianna were occupied by women alone. A couple of violins and a\r\nbass-fiddle were being tuned behind the curtains of the stage; the old\r\ngentleman's heart beat with expectation; and when all at once the\r\norchestra struck up the _ritornello_ of his work, he felt an electric\r\nthrill tingling in every nerve.\r\n\r\nFormica came forward in the character of Pasquarello, and sang--sang in\r\nCapuzzi's own voice, and with all his characteristic gestures, the most\r\nhopeless aria that ever was heard. The theatre shook with the loud and\r\nboisterous laughter of the audience. They shouted; they screamed\r\nwildly, \"O Pasquale Capuzzi! Our most illustrious composer and artist!\r\nBravo! Bravissimo!\" The old gentleman, not perceiving the ridicule and\r\nirony of the laughter, was in raptures of delight. The aria came to an\r\nend, and the people cried \"Sh! sh!\" for Doctor Gratiano, played on this\r\noccasion by Nicolo Musso himself, appeared on the stage, holding his\r\nhands over his ears and shouting to Pasquarello for goodness' sake to\r\nstop his ridiculous screeching.\r\n\r\nThen the Doctor asked Pasquarello how long he had taken to the\r\nconfounded habit of singing, and where he had got that execrable piece\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Pasquarello replied, that he didn't know what the Doctor\r\nwould have; he was like the Romans, and had no taste for real music,\r\nsince he failed to recognise the most talented of musicians. The aria\r\nhad been written by the greatest of living composers, in whose service\r\nhe had the good fortune to be, receiving instruction in both music and\r\nsinging from the master himself.\r\n\r\nGratiano then began guessing, and mentioned the names of a great number\r\nof well-known composers and musicians, but at every distinguished name\r\nPasquarello only shook his head contemptuously.\r\n\r\nAt length Pasquarello said that the Doctor was only exposing gross\r\nignorance, since he did not know the name of the greatest composer of\r\nthe time. It was no other than Signor Pasquale Capuzzi, who had done\r\nhim the honour of taking him into his service. Could he not see that he\r\nwas the friend and servant of Signor Pasquale?\r\n\r\nThen the Doctor broke out into a loud long roar of laughter, and cried.\r\nWhat! Had he (Pasquarello) after running away from him (the Doctor),\r\nwith whom, besides getting his wages and food, he had had his palm\r\ntickled with many a copper, had he gone and taken service with the\r\nbiggest and most inveterate old coxcomb who ever stuffed himself with\r\nmacaroni, to the patched Carnival fool who strutted about like a\r\nsatisfied old hen after a shower of rain, to the snarling skinflint,\r\nthe love-sick old poltroon, who infected the air of the Via Ripetta\r\nwith the disgusting bleating which he called singing? &c., &c.\r\n\r\nTo which Pasquarello, quite incensed, made reply that it was nothing\r\nbut envy which spoke in the Doctor's words; he (Pasquarello) was of\r\ncourse speaking with his heart in his mouth (_parla col cuore in\r\nmano_); the Doctor was not at all the man to pass an opinion upon\r\nSignor Pasquale Capuzzi di Senigaglia; he was speaking with his heart\r\nin his mouth. The Doctor himself had a strong tang of all that he\r\nblamed in the excellent Signor Pasquale; but he was speaking with his\r\nheart in his mouth; he (Pasquarello) had himself often heard fully six\r\nhundred people at once laugh most heartily at Doctor Gratiano, and so\r\nforth. Then Pasquarello spoke a long panegyric upon his new master,\r\nSignor Pasquale, attributing to him all the virtues under the sun; and\r\nhe concluded with a description of his character, which he portrayed as\r\nbeing the very essence of amiability and grace.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven bless you, Formica!\" lisped Signor Capuzzi to himself; \"Heaven\r\nbless you, Formica! I perceive you have designed to make my triumph\r\nperfect, since you are upbraiding the Romans for all their envious and\r\nungrateful persecution of me, and are letting them know _who_ I really\r\nam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! here comes my master himself,\" cried Pasquarello at this moment,\r\nand there entered on the stage--Signor Pasquale Capuzzi himself, just\r\nas he breathed and walked, his very clothes, face, gestures, gait,\r\npostures, in fact so perfectly like Signor Capuzzi in the auditorium,\r\nthat the latter, quite aghast, let go Marianna's hand, which hitherto\r\nhe had held fast in his own, and tapped himself, his nose, his wig, in\r\norder to discover whether he was not dreaming, or seeing double,\r\nwhether he was really sitting in Nicolo Musso's theatre and dare credit\r\nthe miracle.\r\n\r\nCapuzzi on the stage embraced Doctor Gratiano with great kindness, and\r\nasked how he was. The Doctor replied that he had a good appetite,\r\nand slept soundly, at his service (_per servirlo_); and as for his\r\npurse--well, it was suffering from a galloping consumption. Only\r\nyesterday he had spent his last ducat for a pair of rosemary-coloured\r\nstockings for his sweetheart, and was just going to walk round to one\r\nor two bankers to see if he could borrow thirty ducats\"----\r\n\r\n\"But how can you pass over your best friends?\" said Capuzzi. \"Here, my\r\ndear sir, here are fifty ducats, come take them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pasquale, what are you about?\" said the real Capuzzi in an undertone.\r\n\r\nDr. Gratiano began to talk about a bond and about interest; but Signor\r\nCapuzzi declared that he could not think of asking for either from such\r\na friend as the Doctor was.\r\n\r\n\"Pasquale, have you gone out of your senses?\" exclaimed the real\r\nCapuzzi a little louder.\r\n\r\nAfter many grateful embraces Doctor Gratiano took his leave. Now\r\nPasquarello drew near with a good many bows, and extolled Signor\r\nCapuzzi to the skies, adding, however, that his purse was suffering\r\nfrom the same complaint as Gratiano's, and he begged for some of the\r\nsame excellent medicine that had cured his. Capuzzi on the stage\r\nlaughed, and said he was pleased to find that Pasquarello knew how to\r\nturn his good humour to advantage, and threw him several glittering\r\nducats.\r\n\r\n\"Pasquale, you must be mad, possessed of the devil,\" cried the real\r\nCapuzzi aloud. He was bidden be still.\r\n\r\nPasquarello went still further in his eulogy of Capuzzi, and came at\r\nlast to speak, of the aria which he (Capuzzi) had composed, and with\r\nwhich he (Pasquarello) hoped to enchant everybody. The fictitious\r\nCapuzzi clapped Pasquarello heartily on the back, and went on to say\r\nthat he might venture to tell him (Pasquarello), his faithful servant,\r\nin confidence, that in reality he knew nothing whatever of the science\r\nof music, and in respect to the aria of which he had just spoken, as\r\nwell as all pieces that he had ever composed, why, he had stolen them\r\nout of Frescobaldi's canzonas and Carissimi's motets.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you you're lying in your throat, you knave,\" shouted the\r\nCapuzzi off the stage, rising from his seat. Again he was bidden keep\r\nstill, and the woman who sat next him drew him down on the bench.\r\n\r\n\"It's now time to think about other and more important matters,\"\r\ncontinued Capuzzi on the stage. He was going to give a grand banquet\r\nthe next day, and Pasquarello must look alive and have everything that\r\nwas necessary prepared. Then he produced and read over a list of all\r\nthe rarest and most expensive dishes, making Pasquarello tell him how\r\nmuch each would cost, and at the same time giving him the money for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Pasquale! You're insane! You've gone mad! You good-for-nothing scamp!\r\nYou spendthrift!\" shouted the real Capuzzi at intervals, growing more\r\nand more enraged the higher the cost of this the most nonsensical of\r\ndinners rose.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the list was finished, Pasquarello asked what had\r\ninduced him to give such a splendid banquet.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow will be the happiest and most joyous day of my life,\"\r\nreplied the fictitious Capuzzi. \"For know, my good Pasquarello, that I\r\nam going to celebrate to-morrow the auspicious marriage of my dear\r\nniece Marianna. I am going to give her hand to that brave young fellow,\r\nthe best of all artists, Scacciati.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had the words fallen from his lips when the real Capuzzi leapt\r\nto his feet, utterly beside himself, quite out of his mind, his face\r\nall aflame with the most fiendish rage, and doubling his fists and\r\nshaking them at his counterpart on the stage, he yelled at the top of\r\nhis voice, \"No, you won't, no, you won't, you rascal! you scoundrel,\r\nyou,--Pasquale! Do you mean to cheat yourself out of your Marianna, you\r\nhound? Are you going to throw her in the arms of that scoundrel,--sweet\r\nMarianna, thy life, thy hope, thy all? Ah! look to it! Look to it! you\r\ninfatuated fool. Just remember what sort of a reception you will meet\r\nwith from yourself. You shall beat yourself black and blue with your\r\nown hands, so that you will have no relish to think about banquets and\r\nweddings!\"\r\n\r\nBut the Capuzzi on the stage doubled his fists like the Capuzzi\r\nbelow, and shouted in exactly the same furious way, and in the same\r\nhigh-pitched voice, \"May all the spirits of hell sit at your heart, you\r\nabominable nonsensical Pasquale, you atrocious skinflint--you love-sick\r\nold fool--you gaudy tricked-out ass with the cap and bells dangling\r\nabout your ears. Take care lest I snuff out the candle of your life,\r\nand so at length put an end to the infamous tricks which you try to\r\nfoist upon the good, honest, modest Pasquale Capuzzi.\"\r\n\r\nAmidst the most fearful cursing and swearing of the real Capuzzi, the\r\none on the stage dished up one fine anecdote after the other about him.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better attempt,\" shouted at last the fictitious Capuzzi, \"you\r\nonly dare, Pasquale, you amorous old ape, to interfere with the\r\nhappiness of these two young people, whom Heaven has destined for each\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment there appeared at the back of the stage Antonio\r\nScacciati and Marianna locked in each other's arms. Albeit the old\r\ngentleman was at other times somewhat feeble on his legs, yet now fury\r\ngave him strength and agility. With a single bound he was on the stage,\r\nhad drawn his sword, and was charging upon the pretended Antonio. He\r\nfound, however, that he was held fast behind. An officer of the Papal\r\nguard had stopped him, and said in a serious voice, \"Recollect where\r\nyou are, Signor Pasquale; you are in Nicolo Musso's theatre. Without\r\nintending it, you have today played a most ridiculous _rôle_. You will\r\nnot find either Antonio or Marianna here.\" The two persons whom Capuzzi\r\nhad taken for his niece and her lover now drew near, along with the\r\nrest of the actors. The faces were all completely strange to him. His\r\nrapier escaped from his trembling hand; he took a deep breath as if\r\nawakening out of a bad dream; he grasped his brow with both hands; he\r\nopened his eyes wide. The presentiment of what had happened suddenly\r\nstruck him, and he shouted, \"Marianna!\" in such a stentorian voice that\r\nthe walls rang again.\r\n\r\nBut she was beyond reach of his shouts. Antonio had taken advantage of\r\nthe opportunity whilst Pasquale, oblivious of all about him and even of\r\nhimself, was quarrelling with his double, to make his way to Marianna,\r\nand back with her through the audience, and out at a side door, where a\r\ncarriage stood ready waiting; and away they went as fast as their\r\nhorses could gallop towards Florence.\r\n\r\n\"Marianna!\" screamed the old man again, \"Marianna! she is gone. She has\r\nfled. That knave Antonio has stolen her from me. Away! after them! Have\r\npity on me, good people, and take torches and help me to look for my\r\nlittle darling. Oh! you serpent!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he tried to make for the door. But the officer held him fast,\r\nsaying, \"Do you mean that pretty young lady who sat beside you?\r\nI believe I saw her slip out with a young man--I think Antonio\r\nScacciati--a long time ago, when you began your idle quarrel with one\r\nof the actors who wore a mask like your face. You needn't make a\r\ntrouble of it; every inquiry shall at once be set on foot, and Marianna\r\nshall be brought back to you as soon as she is found. But as for\r\nyourself, Signor Pasquale, your behaviour here and your murderous\r\nattempt upon the life of that actor compel me to arrest you.\"\r\n\r\nSignor Pasquale, his face as pale as death, incapable of uttering a\r\nsingle word or even a sound, was led away by the very same gendarmes\r\nwho were to have protected him against masked devils and spectres. Thus\r\nit came to pass that on the selfsame night on which he had hoped to\r\ncelebrate his triumph, he was plunged into the midst of trouble and of\r\nall the frantic despondency which amorous old fools feel when they are\r\ndeceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n_Salvator Rosa leaves Rome and goes to Florence. Conclusion of the\r\nhistory._\r\n\r\nEverything here below beneath the sun is subject to continual change;\r\nand perhaps there is nothing which can be called more inconstant than\r\nhuman opinion, which turns round in an everlasting circle like the\r\nwheel of fortune. He who reaps great praise to-day is overwhelmed with\r\nbiting censure to-morrow; to-day we trample under foot the man who\r\nto-morrow will be raised far above us.\r\n\r\nOf all those who in Rome had ridiculed and mocked at old Pasquale\r\nCapuzzi, with his sordid avarice, his foolish amorousness, his insane\r\njealousy, who did not wish poor tormented Marianna her liberty? But now\r\nthat Antonio had successfully carried off his mistress, all their\r\nridicule and mockery was suddenly changed into pity for the old fool,\r\nwhom they saw wandering about the streets of Rome with his head hanging\r\non his breast, utterly disconsolate. Misfortunes seldom come singly;\r\nand so it happened that Signor Pasquale, soon after Marianna had been\r\ntaken from him, lost his best bosom-friends also. Little Pitichinaccio\r\nchoked himself in foolishly trying to swallow an almond-kernel in the\r\nmiddle of a cadenza; but a sudden stop was put to the life of the\r\nillustrious Pyramid Doctor Signor Splendiano Accoramboni by a slip of\r\nthe pen, for which he had only himself to blame. Michele's drubbing\r\nmade such work with him that he fell into a fever. He determined to\r\nmake use of a remedy which he claimed to have discovered, so, calling\r\nfor pen and ink, he wrote down a prescription in which, by employing a\r\nwrong sign, he increased the quantity of a powerful substance to a\r\ndangerous extent. But scarcely had he swallowed the medicine than he\r\nsank back on the pillows and died, establishing, however, by his own\r\ndeath in the most splendid and satisfactory manner the efficacy of the\r\nlast tincture which he ever prescribed.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, all those whose laughter had been the loudest, and\r\nwho had repeatedly wished Antonio success in his schemes, had now\r\nnothing but pity for the old gentleman; and the bitterest blame was\r\nheaped, not so much upon Antonio, as upon Salvator Rosa, whom, to be\r\nsure, they regarded as the instigator of the whole plan.\r\n\r\nSalvator's enemies, of whom he had a goodly number, exerted all their\r\nefforts to fan the flame. \"See you,\" they said, \"he was one of\r\nMasaniello's doughty partisans, and is ready to turn his hand to any\r\ndeed of mischief, to any disreputable enterprise; we shall be the next\r\nto suffer from his presence in the city; he is a dangerous man.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the jealous faction who had leagued together against Salvator did\r\nactually succeed in stemming the tide of his prosperous career. He sent\r\nforth from his studio one picture after the other, all bold in\r\nconception, and splendidly executed; but the so-called critics shrugged\r\ntheir shoulders, now pointing out that the hills were too blue, the\r\ntrees too green, the figures now too long, now too broad, finding fault\r\neverywhere where there was no fault to be found, and seeking to detract\r\nfrom his hard-earned reputation in all the ways they could think of.\r\nEspecially bitter in their persecution of him were the Academicians of\r\nSt. Luke, who could not forget how he took them in about the surgeon;\r\nthey even went beyond the limits of their own profession, and decried\r\nthe clever stanzas which Salvator at that time wrote, hinting very\r\nplainly that he did not cultivate his fruit on his own garden soil, but\r\nplundered that of his neighbours. For these reasons, therefore,\r\nSalvator could not manage to surround himself with the splendour which\r\nhe had lived amidst formerly in Rome. Instead of being visited by the\r\nmost eminent of the Romans in a large studio, he had to remain with\r\nDame Caterina and his green fig-tree; but amid these poor surroundings\r\nhe frequently found both consolation and tranquillity of mind.\r\n\r\nSalvator took the malicious machinations of his enemies to heart more\r\nthan he ought to have done; he even began to feel that an insidious\r\ndisease, resulting from chagrin and dejection, was gnawing at his\r\nvitals. In this unhappy frame of mind he designed and executed two\r\nlarge pictures which excited quite an uproar in Rome. Of these one\r\nrepresented the transitoriness of all earthly things, and in the\r\nprincipal figure, that of a wanton female bearing all the indications\r\nof her degrading calling about her, was recognised the mistress of one\r\nof the cardinals; the other portrayed the Goddess of Fortune dispensing\r\nher rich gifts. But cardinals' hats, bishops' mitres, gold medals,\r\ndecorations of orders, were falling upon bleating sheep, braying asses,\r\nand other such like contemptible animals, whilst well-made men in\r\nragged clothes were vainly straining their eyes upwards to get even the\r\nsmallest gift. Salvator had given free rein to his embittered mood, and\r\nthe animals' heads bore the closest resemblance to the features of\r\nvarious eminent persons. It is easy to imagine, therefore, how the tide\r\nof hatred against him rose, and that he was more bitterly persecuted\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nDame Caterina warned him, with tears in her eyes, that as soon as it\r\nbegan to be dark she had observed suspicious characters lurking about\r\nthe house and apparently dogging his every footstep. Salvator saw that\r\nit was time to leave Rome; and Dame Caterina and her beloved daughters\r\nwere the only people whom it caused him pain to part from. In response\r\nto the repeated invitations of the Duke of Tuscany,[6.1] he went to\r\nFlorence; and here at length he was richly indemnified for all the\r\nmortification and worry which he had had to struggle against in Rome,\r\nand here all the honour and all the fame which he so truly deserved\r\nwere freely conferred upon him. The Duke's presents and the high prices\r\nwhich he received for his pictures soon enabled him to remove into a\r\nlarge house and to furnish it in the most magnificent style. There he\r\nwas wont to gather round him the most illustrious authors and scholars\r\nof the day, amongst whom it will be sufficient to mention Evangelista\r\nToricelli,[6.2] Valerio Chimentelli, Battista Ricciardi, Andrea\r\nCavalcanti, Pietro Salvati, Filippo Apolloni, Volumnio Bandelli,\r\nFrancesco Rovai. They formed an association for the prosecution of\r\nartistic and scientific pursuits, whilst Salvator was able to\r\ncontribute an element of whimsicality to the meetings, which had a\r\nsingular effect in animating and enlivening the mind. The\r\nbanqueting-hall was like a beautiful grove with fragrant bushes and\r\nflowers and splashing fountains; and the dishes even, which were served\r\nup by pages in eccentric costumes, were very wonderful to look at, as\r\nif they came from some distant land of magic. These meetings of writers\r\nand savans in Salvator Rosa's house were called at that time the\r\nAccademia de' Percossi.\r\n\r\nThough Salvator's mind was in this way devoted to science and art, yet\r\nhis real true nature came to life again when he was with his friend\r\nAntonio Scacciati, who, along with his lovely Marianna, led the\r\npleasant _sans souci_ life of an artist. They often recalled poor old\r\nSignor Pasquale whom they had deceived, and all that had taken place in\r\nNicolo Musso's theatre. Antonio asked Salvator how he had contrived to\r\nenlist in his cause the active interest not only of Musso but of the\r\nexcellent Formica, and of Agli too. Salvator replied that it had been\r\nvery easy, for Formica was his most intimate friend in Rome, so that it\r\nhad been a work of both pleasure and love to him to arrange everything\r\non the stage in accordance with the instructions Salvator gave him.\r\nAntonio protested that, though still he could not help laughing over\r\nthe scene which had paved the way to his happiness, he yet wished with\r\nall his heart to be reconciled to the old gentleman, even if he should\r\nnever touch a penny of Marianna's fortune, which the old gentleman had\r\nconfiscated; the practice of his art brought him in a sufficient\r\nincome. Marianna too was often unable to restrain her tears when she\r\nthought that her father's brother might go down to his grave without\r\nhaving forgiven her the trick which she had played upon him; and so\r\nPasquale's hatred overshadowed like a dark cloud the brightness of\r\ntheir happiness. Salvator comforted them both--Antonio and Marianna--by\r\nsaying that time had adjusted still worse difficulties, and that chance\r\nwould perhaps bring the old gentleman near them in some less dangerous\r\nway than if they had remained in Rome, or were to return there now.\r\n\r\nWe shall see that a prophetic spirit spoke in Salvator.\r\n\r\nA considerable time elapsed, when one day Antonio burst into Salvator's\r\nstudio breathless and pale as death. \"Salvator!\" he cried, \"Salvator,\r\nmy friend, my protector! I am lost if you do not help me. Pasquale\r\nCapuzzi is here; he has procured a warrant for my arrest for the\r\nseduction of his niece.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can Signor Pasquale do against you now?\" asked Salvator.\r\n\"Have you not been united to Marianna by the Church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" replied Antonio, giving way completely to despair, \"the blessing\r\nof the Church herself cannot save me from ruin. Heaven knows by what\r\nmeans the old man has been able to approach the Pope's nephew.[6.3] At\r\nany rate the Pope's nephew has taken the old man under his protection,\r\nand has infused into him the hope that the Holy Father will declare my\r\nmarriage with Marianna to be null and void; nay, yet further, that he\r\nwill grant him (the old man) dispensation to marry his niece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" cried Salvator, \"now I see it all; now I see it all. What\r\nthreatens to be your ruin, Antonio, is this man's hatred against me.\r\nFor I must tell you that this nephew of the Pope's, a proud, coarse,\r\nboorish clown, was amongst the animals in my picture to whom the\r\nGoddess of Fortune is dispensing her gifts. That it was I who helped\r\nyou to win your Marianna, though indirectly, is well known, not only to\r\nthis man, but to all Rome,--which is quite reason enough to persecute\r\nyou since they cannot do anything to me. And so, Antonio, having\r\nbrought this misfortune upon you, I must make every effort to assist\r\nyou, and all the more that you are my dearest and most intimate friend.\r\nBut, by the saints! I don't see in what way I can frustrate your\r\nenemies' little game\"----\r\n\r\nTherewith Salvator, who had continued to paint at a picture all the\r\ntime, laid aside brush, palette, and maulstick, and, rising up from his\r\neasel, began to pace the room backwards and forwards, his arms crossed\r\nover his breast, Antonio meanwhile being quite wrapt up in his own\r\nthoughts, and with his eyes fixed unchangeably upon the floor.\r\n\r\nAt length Salvator paused before him and said with a smile, \"See here,\r\nAntonio, I cannot do anything myself against your powerful enemies, but\r\nI know one who can help you, and who will help you, and that is--Signor\r\nFormica.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Antonio, \"don't jest with an unhappy man, whom nothing can\r\nsave.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! you are despairing again?\" exclaimed Salvator, who was now all\r\nat once in the merriest humour, and he laughed aloud. \"I tell you,\r\nAntonio, my friend Formica shall help you in Florence as he helped you\r\nin Rome. Go away quietly home and comfort your Marianna, and calmly\r\nwait and see how things will turn out. I trust you will be ready at the\r\nshortest notice to do what Signor Formica, who is really here in\r\nFlorence at the present time, shall require of you.\" This Antonio\r\npromised most faithfully, and hope revived in him again, and\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nSignor Pasquale Capuzzi was not a little astonished at receiving a\r\nformal invitation from the Accademia de' Percossi. \"Ah!\" he exclaimed,\r\n\"Florence is the place then where a man's merits are recognised, where\r\nPasquale Capuzzi di Senigaglia, a man gifted with the most excellent\r\ntalents, is known and valued.\" Thus the thought of his knowledge and\r\nhis art, and the honour that was shown him on their account, overcame\r\nthe repugnance which he would otherwise have felt against a society at\r\nthe head of which stood Salvator Rosa. His Spanish gala-dress was more\r\ncarefully brushed than ever; his conical hat was equipped with a new\r\nfeather; his shoes were provided with new ribbons; and so Signor\r\nPasquale appeared at Salvator's as brilliant as a rose-chafer,[6.4] and\r\nhis face all sunshine. The magnificence which he saw on all sides of\r\nhim, even Salvator himself, who had received him dressed in the richest\r\napparel, inspired him with deep respect, and, after the manner of\r\nlittle souls, who, though at first proud and puffed up, at once grovel\r\nin the dust whenever they come into contact with what they feel to be\r\nsuperior to themselves, Pasquale's behaviour towards Salvator, whom he\r\nwould gladly have done a mischief to in Rome, was nothing but humility\r\nand submissive deference.\r\n\r\nSo much attention was paid to Signor Pasquale from all sides, his\r\njudgment was appealed to so unconditionally, and so much was said about\r\nhis services to art, that he felt new life infused into his veins; and\r\nan unusual spirit was awakened within him, so that his utterances on\r\nmany points were more sensible than might have been expected. If it be\r\nadded that never in his life before had he been so splendidly\r\nentertained, and never had he drunk such inspiriting wine, it will\r\nreadily be conceived that his pleasure was intensified from moment to\r\nmoment, and that he forgot all the wrong which had been done him at\r\nRome as well as the unpleasant business which had brought him to\r\nFlorence. Often after their banquets the Academicians were wont to\r\namuse themselves with short impromptu dramatic representations, and so\r\nthis evening the distinguished playwright and poet Filippo Apolloni\r\ncalled upon those who generally took part in them to bring the\r\nfestivities to a fitting conclusion with one of their usual\r\nperformances. Salvator at once withdrew to make all the necessary\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards the bushes at the farther end of the\r\nbanqueting-hall began to move, the branches with their foliage were\r\nparted, and a little theatre provided with seats for the spectators\r\nbecame visible.\r\n\r\n\"By the saints!\" exclaimed Pasquale Capuzzi, terrified, \"where am I?\r\nSurely that's Nicolo Musso's theatre.\"\r\n\r\nWithout heeding his exclamation, Evangelista Toricelli and Andrea\r\nCavalcanti--both of them grave, respectable, venerable men--took him by\r\nthe arm and led him to a seat immediately in front of the stage, taking\r\ntheir places on each side of him.\r\n\r\nThis was no sooner done than there appeared on the boards--Formica in\r\nthe character of Pasquarello.\r\n\r\n\"You reprobate, Formica!\" shouted Pasquale, leaping to his feet and\r\nshaking his doubled fist at the stage. Toricelli and Cavalcanti's\r\nstern, reproving glances bade him sit still and keep quiet.\r\n\r\nPasquarello wept and sobbed, and cursed his destiny, which brought him\r\nnothing but grief and heart-breaking, declared he didn't know how he\r\nshould ever set about it if he wanted to laugh again, and concluded by\r\nsaying that if he could look upon blood without fainting, he should\r\ncertainly cut his throat, or should throw himself in the Tiber if he\r\ncould only let that cursed swimming alone when he got into the water.\r\n\r\nDoctor Gratiano now joined him, and inquired what was the cause of his\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Pasquarello asked him whether he did not know anything about\r\nwhat had taken place in the house of his master, Signor Pasquale\r\nCapuzzi di Senigaglia, whether he did not know that an infamous\r\nscoundrel had carried off pretty Marianna, his master's niece?\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" murmured Capuzzi, \"I see you want to make your excuses to me,\r\nFormica; you wish for my pardon--well, we shall see.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Gratiano expressed his sympathy, and observed that the scoundrel\r\nmust have gone to work very cunningly to have eluded all the inquiries\r\nwhich had been instituted by Capuzzi.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" rejoined Pasquarello. \"The Doctor need not imagine that the\r\nscoundrel, Antonio Scacciati, had succeeded in escaping the sharpness\r\nof Signor Pasquale Capuzzi, supported as he was, moreover, by powerful\r\nfriends. Antonio had been arrested, his marriage with Marianna\r\nannulled, and Marianna herself had again come into Capuzzi's power.\r\n\r\n\"Has he got her again?\" shouted Capuzzi, beside himself; \"has he got\r\nher again, good Pasquale? Has he got his little darling, his Marianna?\r\nIs the knave Antonio arrested? Heaven bless you, Formica!\"\r\n\r\n\"You take a too keen interest in the play, Signor Pasquale,\" said\r\nCavalcanti, quite seriously. \"Pray permit the actors to proceed with\r\ntheir parts without interrupting them in this disturbing fashion.\"\r\n\r\nAshamed of himself, Signor Pasquale resumed his seat, for he had again\r\nrisen to his feet.\r\n\r\nDoctor Gratiano asked what had taken place then.\r\n\r\nA wedding, continued Pasquarello, a wedding had taken place. Marianna\r\nhad repented of what she had done; Signor Pasquale had obtained the\r\ndesired dispensation from the Holy Father, and had married his niece.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" murmured Pasquale Capuzzi to himself, whilst his eyes\r\nsparkled with delight, \"yes, yes, my dear, good Formica; he will marry\r\nhis sweet Marianna, the happy Pasquale. He knew that the dear little\r\ndarling had always loved him, and that it was only Satan who had led\r\nher astray.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then, everything is all right,\" said Doctor Gratiano, \"and there's\r\nno cause for lamentation.\"\r\n\r\nPasquarello began, however, to weep and sob more violently than before,\r\ntill at length, as if overcome by the terrible nature of his pain, he\r\nfainted away. Doctor Gratiano ran backwards and forwards in great\r\ndistress, was so sorry he had no smelling-bottle with him, felt in all\r\nhis pockets, and at last produced a roasted chestnut, and put it under\r\nthe insensible Pasquarello's nose. He at once recovered, sneezing\r\nviolently, and begging him to attribute his faintness to his weak\r\nnerves, he related how that, immediately after the marriage, Marianna\r\nhad been afflicted with the saddest melancholy, continually calling\r\nupon Antonio, and treating the old gentleman with contempt and\r\naversion. But the old fellow, quite infatuated by his passion and\r\njealousy, had not ceased to torment the poor girl with his folly in the\r\nmost abominable way. And here Pasquarello mentioned a host of mad\r\ntricks which Pasquale had done, and which were really current in Rome\r\nabout him. Signor Capuzzi sat on thorns; he murmured at intervals,\r\n\"Curse you, Formica! You are lying! What evil spirit is in you?\" He was\r\nonly prevented from bursting out into a violent passion by Toricelli\r\nand Cavalcanti, who sat watching him with an earnest gaze.\r\n\r\nPasquarello concluded his narration by telling that Marianna had at\r\nlength succumbed to her unsatisfied longing for her lover, her great\r\ndistress of mind, and the innumerable tortures which were inflicted\r\nupon her by the execrable old fellow, and had died in the flower of her\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nAt this moment was heard a mournful _De profundis_ sung by hollow,\r\nhusky voices, and men clad in long black robes appeared on the stage,\r\nbearing an open coffin, within which was seen the corpse of lovely\r\nMarianna wrapped in white shrouds. Behind it came Signor Pasquale\r\nCapuzzi in the deepest mourning, feebly staggering along and wailing\r\naloud, beating his breast, and crying in a voice of despair, \"O\r\nMarianna! Marianna!\"\r\n\r\nSo soon as the real Capuzzi caught sight of his niece's corpse he broke\r\nout into loud lamentations, and both Capuzzis, the one on the stage and\r\nthe one off, gave vent to their grief in the most heartrending wails\r\nand groans, \"O Marianna! O Marianna! O unhappy me! Alas! Alas for me!\"\r\n\r\nLet the reader picture to himself the open coffin with the corpse of\r\nthe lovely child, surrounded by the hired mourners singing their dismal\r\n_De profundis_ in hoarse voices, and then the comical masks of\r\nPasquarello and Dr. Gratiano, who were expressing their grief in the\r\nmost ridiculous gestures, and lastly the two Capuzzis, wailing and\r\nscreeching in despair. Indeed, all who were witnesses of the\r\nextraordinary spectacle could not help feeling, even in the midst of\r\nthe unrestrained laughter they had burst out into at sight of the\r\nwonderful old gentleman, that their hearts were chilled by a most\r\nuncomfortable feeling of awe.\r\n\r\nNow the stage grew dark, and it thundered and lightened, and there rose\r\nup from below a pale ghostly figure, which bore most unmistakably the\r\nfeatures of Capuzzi's dead brother, Pietro of Senigaglia, Marianna's\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\"O you infamous brother, Pasquale! what have you done with my daughter?\r\nwhat have you done with my daughter?\" wailed the figure, in a dreadful\r\nand hollow voice. \"Despair, you atrocious murderer of my child. You\r\nshall find your reward in hell.\"\r\n\r\nCapuzzi on the stage dropped on the floor as if struck by lightning,\r\nand at the same moment the real Capuzzi reeled from his seat\r\nunconscious. The bushes rustled together again, and the stage was gone,\r\nand also Marianna and Capuzzi and the ghastly spectre Pietro. Signor\r\nPasquale Capuzzi lay in such a dead faint that it cost a good deal of\r\ntrouble to revive him.\r\n\r\nAt length he came to himself with a deep sigh, and, stretching out both\r\nhands before him as if to ward off the horror that had seized him, he\r\ncried in a husky voice, \"Leave me alone, Pietro.\" Then a torrent of\r\ntears ran down his cheeks, and he sobbed and cried, \"Oh! Marianna, my\r\ndarling child--my--my Marianna.\" \"But recollect yourself,\" said now\r\nCavalcanti, \"recollect yourself, Signor Pasquale, it was only on the\r\nstage that you saw your niece dead. She is alive; she is here to crave\r\npardon for the thoughtless step which love and also your own\r\ninconsiderate conduct drove her to take.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Marianna, and behind her Antonio Scacciati, now ran forward from\r\nthe back part of the hall and threw themselves at the old gentleman's\r\nfeet,--for he had meanwhile been placed in an easy chair. Marianna,\r\nlooking most charming and beautiful, kissed his hands and bathed them\r\nwith scalding tears, beseeching him to pardon both her and Antonio, to\r\nwhom she had been united by the blessing of the Church.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the hot blood surged into the old man's pallid face, fury\r\nflashed from his eyes, and he cried in a half-choked voice, \"Oh! you\r\nabominable scoundrel! You poisonous serpent whom I nourished in my\r\nbosom!\" Then old Toricelli, with grave and thoughtful dignity, put\r\nhimself in front of Capuzzi, and told him that he (Capuzzi) had seen a\r\nrepresentation of the fate that would inevitably and irremediably\r\novertake him if he had the hardihood to carry out his wicked purpose\r\nagainst Antonio and Marianna's peace and happiness. He depicted in\r\nstartling colours the folly and madness of amorous old men, who call\r\ndown upon their own heads the most ruinous mischief which Heaven can\r\ninflict upon a man, since all the love which might have fallen to their\r\nshare is lost, and instead hatred and contempt shoot their fatal darts\r\nat them from every side.\r\n\r\nAt intervals lovely Marianna cried in a tone that went to everybody's\r\nheart, \"O my uncle, I will love and honour you as my own father; you\r\nwill kill me by a cruel death if you rob me of my Antonio.\" And all the\r\neminent men by whom the old gentleman was surrounded cried with one\r\naccord that it would not be possible for a man like Signor Pasquale\r\nCapuzzi di Senigaglia, a patron of art and himself an artist, not to\r\nforgive the young people, and assume the part of father to the most\r\nlovely of ladies, not possible that he could refuse to accept with joy\r\nas his son-in-law such an artist as Antonio Scacciati, who was highly\r\nesteemed throughout all Italy and richly crowned with fame and honour.\r\n\r\nThen it was patent to see that a violent struggle went on within the\r\nold gentleman. He sighed, moaned, clasped his hands before his face,\r\nand, whilst Toricelli was continuing to speak in a most impressive\r\nmanner, and Marianna was appealing to him in the most touching accents,\r\nand the rest were extolling Antonio all they knew how, he kept looking\r\ndown--now upon his niece, now upon Antonio, whose splendid clothes and\r\nrich chains of honour bore testimony to the truth of what was said\r\nabout the artistic fame he had earned.\r\n\r\nGone was all rage out of Capuzzi's countenance; he sprang up with\r\nradiant eyes, and pressed Marianna to his heart, saying, \"Yes, I\r\nforgive you, my dear child; I forgive you, Antonio. Far be it from me\r\nto disturb your happiness. You are right, my worthy Signor Toricelli;\r\nFormica has shown me in the tableau on the stage all the mischief and\r\nruin that would have befallen me had I carried out my insane design. I\r\nam cured, quite cured of my folly. But where is Signor Formica, where\r\nis my good physician? let me thank him a thousand times for my cure; it\r\nis he alone who has accomplished it. The terror that he has caused me\r\nto feel has brought about a complete revolution within me.\"\r\n\r\nPasquarello stepped forward. Antonio threw himself upon his neck,\r\ncrying, \"O Signor Formica, you to whom I owe my life, my all--oh! take\r\noff this disfiguring mask, that I may see your face, that Formica may\r\nnot be any longer a mystery to me.\"\r\n\r\nPasquarello took off his cap and his artificial mask, which looked like\r\na natural face, since it offered not the slightest hindrance to the\r\nplay of countenance, and this Formica, this Pasquarello, was\r\ntransformed into--Salvator Rosa.[6.5]\r\n\r\n\"Salvator!\" exclaimed Marianna, Antonio, and Capuzzi, utterly\r\nastounded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said that wonderful man, \"it is Salvator Rosa, whom the Romans\r\nwould not recognise as painter and poet, but who in the character of\r\nFormica drew from them, without their being aware of it, almost every\r\nevening for more than a year, in Nicolo Musso's wretched little\r\ntheatre, the most noisy and most demonstrative storms of applause, from\r\nwhose mouth they willingly took all the scorn, and all the satiric\r\nmockery of what is bad, which they would on no account listen to and\r\nsee in Salvator's poems and pictures. It is Salvator Formica who has\r\nhelped you, dear Antonio.\"\r\n\r\n\"Salvator,\" began old Capuzzi, \"Salvator Rosa, albeit I have always\r\nregarded you as my worst enemy, yet I have always prized your artistic\r\nskill very highly, and now I love you as the worthiest friend I have,\r\nand beg you to accept my friendship in return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" replied Salvator, \"tell me, my worthy Signor Pasquale, what\r\nservice I can render you, and accept my assurances beforehand, that I\r\nwill leave no stone unturned to accomplish whatever you may ask of me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the genial smile which had not been seen upon Capuzzi's face\r\nsince Marianna had been carried off, began to steal back again. Taking\r\nSalvator's hand he lisped in a low voice, \"My dear Signor Salvator, you\r\npossess an unlimited influence over good Antonio; beseech him in my\r\nname to permit me to spend the short rest of my days with him, and my\r\ndear daughter Marianna, and to accept at my hands the inheritance left\r\nher by her mother, as well as the good dowry which I was thinking of\r\nadding to it. And he must not look jealous if I occasionally kiss the\r\ndear sweet child's little white hand; and ask him--every Sunday at\r\nleast when I go to Mass, to trim up my rough moustache, for there's\r\nnobody in all the wide world understands it so well as he does.\"\r\n\r\nIt cost Salvator an effort to repress his laughter at the strange old\r\nman; but before he could make any reply, Antonio and Marianna,\r\nembracing the old gentleman, assured him that they should not believe\r\nhe was fully reconciled to them, and should not be really happy, until\r\nhe came to live with them as their dear father, never to leave them\r\nagain. Antonio added that not only on Sunday, but every other day, he\r\nwould trim Capuzzi's moustache as elegantly as he knew how, and\r\naccordingly the old gentleman was perfectly radiant with delight.\r\nMeanwhile a splendid supper had been prepared, to which the entire\r\ncompany now turned in the best of spirits.\r\n\r\nIn taking my leave of you, beloved reader, I wish with all my heart\r\nthat, whilst you have been reading the story of the wonderful Signor\r\nFormica, you have derived as much pure pleasure from it as Salvator and\r\nall his friends felt on sitting down to their supper.\r\n\r\n                      *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO \"SIGNOR FORMICA\":\r\n\r\n                                 PART I.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1.1: This tale was written for the Leipsic _Taschenbuch zum\r\ngeselligen Vergnügen_ for the year 1820.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1.2: Respecting the facts of Salvator Rosa's life there\r\nexists more than one disputed statement; and of these perhaps the most\r\ndisputed is his share of complicity (if any) in the evil doings of\r\nCalabrian banditti. Poor, and of a wild and self-willed disposition,\r\nbut with a strong and independent character, he was unable to find a\r\nsuitable master in Naples, so, at the age of eighteen, he set out to\r\nstudy the lineaments of nature face to face, and spent some time amidst\r\nthe grand and savage scenery of Calabria. Here it is certain that he\r\ncame into contact with the banditti who haunted those wild regions. He\r\nis alleged to have been taken prisoner by a band, and to have become a\r\nmember of the troop. Accepting this as true, we may perhaps charitably\r\nbelieve that he was prompted not so much by a regard for his own\r\nsafety, as by the wish to secure a rare opportunity for studying his\r\nart unhindered, and also charitably hope that the accusations of his\r\nenemies, that he actively participated in the deeds of his companions,\r\nare unfounded, or, at any rate, exaggerations. It may be remarked that\r\nthe \"Life and Times of Salvator Rosa\" by Lady Morgan (1824) is\r\nadmittedly a romance rather than an accurate and faithful biography.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1.3: Masaniello, a poor fisherman of Naples, was for a week\r\nin July, 1647, absolute king of his native city.

There did really exist a\r\nso-called \"Cabal of Naples,\" consisting chiefly of the painters\r\nCorenzio, Ribera, and Caracciolo, who leagued together to shut out all\r\ncompetition from other artists; and their persecution of the Bolognese\r\nDomenichino is well known.

Mother, to be sure, is angry, and Clara, I dare say,\r\nbelieves I am living here in riot and revelry, and quite forgetting my\r\nsweet angel, whose image is so deeply engraved upon my heart and mind.\r\nBut that is not so; daily and hourly do I think of you all, and my\r\nlovely Clara's form comes to gladden me in my dreams, and smiles upon\r\nme with her bright eyes, as graciously as she used to do in the days\r\nwhen I went in and out amongst you. Oh! how could I write to you in the\r\ndistracted state of mind in which I have been, and which, until now,\r\nhas quite bewildered me! A terrible thing has happened to me. Dark\r\nforebodings of some awful fate threatening me are spreading themselves\r\nout over my head like black clouds, impenetrable to every friendly ray\r\nof sunlight. I must now tell you what has taken place; I must, that I\r\nsee well enough, but only to think upon it makes the wild laughter\r\nburst from my lips. Oh! my dear, dear Lothair, what shall I say to make\r\nyou feel, if only in an inadequate way, that that which happened to me\r\na few days ago could thus really exercise such a hostile and disturbing\r\ninfluence upon my life? Oh that you were here to see for yourself! but\r\nnow you will, I suppose, take me for a superstitious ghost-seer. In a\r\nword, the terrible thing which I have experienced, the fatal effect of\r\nwhich I in vain exert every effort to shake off, is simply that some\r\ndays ago, namely, on the 30th October, at twelve o'clock at noon, a\r\ndealer in weather-glasses came into my room and wanted to sell me one\r\nof his wares. I bought nothing, and threatened to kick him downstairs,\r\nwhereupon he went away of his own accord.\r\n\r\nYou will conclude that it can only be very peculiar relations--\r\nrelations intimately intertwined with my life--that can give\r\nsignificance to this event, and that it must be the person of this\r\nunfortunate hawker which has had such a very inimical effect upon me.\r\nAnd so it really is. I will summon up all my faculties in order to\r\nnarrate to you calmly and patiently as much of the early days of my\r\nyouth as will suffice to put matters before you in such a way that your\r\nkeen sharp intellect may grasp everything clearly and distinctly, in\r\nbright and living pictures. Just as I am beginning, I hear you laugh\r\nand Clara say, \"What's all this childish nonsense about!\" Well, laugh\r\nat me, laugh heartily at me, pray do. But, good God! my hair is\r\nstanding on end, and I seem to be entreating you to laugh at me in the\r\nsame sort of frantic despair in which Franz Moor entreated Daniel to\r\nlaugh him to scorn.[2] But to my story.\r\n\r\nExcept at dinner we, _i.e._, I and my brothers and sisters, saw but\r\nlittle of our father all day long. His business no doubt took up most\r\nof his time. After our evening meal, which, in accordance with an old\r\ncustom, was served at seven o'clock, we all went, mother with us, into\r\nfather's room, and took our places around a round table. My father\r\nsmoked his pipe, drinking a large glass of beer to it. Often he told us\r\nmany wonderful stories, and got so excited over them that his pipe\r\nalways went out; I used then to light it for him with a spill, and this\r\nformed my chief amusement. Often, again, he would give us picture-books\r\nto look at, whilst he sat silent and motionless in his easy-chair,\r\npuffing out such dense clouds of smoke that we were all as it were\r\nenveloped in mist. On such evenings mother was very sad; and directly\r\nit struck nine she said, \"Come, children! off to bed! Come! The\r\n'Sand-man' is come I see.\" And I always did seem to hear something\r\ntrampling upstairs with slow heavy steps; that must be the Sand-man.\r\nOnce in particular I was very much frightened at this dull trampling\r\nand knocking; as mother was leading us out of the room I asked her, \"O\r\nmamma! but who is this nasty Sand-man who always sends us away from\r\npapa? What does he look like?\" \"There is no Sand-man, my dear child,\"\r\nmother answered; \"when I say the Sand-man is come, I only mean that you\r\nare sleepy and can't keep your eyes open, as if somebody had put sand\r\nin them.\" This answer of mother's did not satisfy me; nay, in my\r\nchildish mind the thought clearly unfolded itself that mother denied\r\nthere was a Sand-man only to prevent us being afraid,--why, I always\r\nheard him come upstairs. Full of curiosity to learn something more\r\nabout this Sand-man and what he had to do with us children, I at length\r\nasked the old woman who acted as my youngest sister's attendant, what\r\nsort of a man he was--the Sand-man? \"Why, 'thanael, darling, don't you\r\nknow?\" she replied. \"Oh! he's a wicked man, who comes to little\r\nchildren when they won't go to bed and throws handfuls of sand in their\r\neyes, so that they jump out of their heads all bloody; and he puts them\r\ninto a bag and takes them to the half-moon as food for his little ones;\r\nand they sit there in the nest and have hooked beaks like owls, and\r\nthey pick naughty little boys' and girls' eyes out with them.\" After\r\nthis I formed in my own mind a horrible picture of the cruel Sand-man.\r\nWhen anything came blundering upstairs at night I trembled with fear\r\nand dismay; and all that my mother could get out of me were the\r\nstammered words \"The Sandman! the Sand-man!\" whilst the tears coursed\r\ndown my cheeks. Then I ran into my bedroom, and the whole night through\r\ntormented myself with the terrible apparition of the Sand-man. I\r\nwas quite old enough to perceive that the old woman's tale about the\r\nSand-man and his little ones' nest in the half-moon couldn't be\r\naltogether true; nevertheless the Sand-man continued to be for me a\r\nfearful incubus, and I was always seized with terror--my blood always\r\nran cold, not only when I heard anybody come up the stairs, but when I\r\nheard anybody noisily open my father's room door and go in. Often he\r\nstayed away for a long season altogether; then he would come several\r\ntimes in close succession.\r\n\r\nThis went on for years, without my being able to accustom myself to\r\nthis fearful apparition, without the image of the horrible Sand-man\r\ngrowing any fainter in my imagination. His intercourse with my father\r\nbegan to occupy my fancy ever more and more; I was restrained from\r\nasking my father about him by an unconquerable shyness; but as the\r\nyears went on the desire waxed stronger and stronger within me to\r\nfathom the mystery myself and to see the fabulous Sand-man. He had been\r\nthe means of disclosing to me the path of the wonderful and the\r\nadventurous, which so easily find lodgment in the mind of the child. I\r\nliked nothing better than to hear or read horrible stories of goblins,\r\nwitches, Tom Thumbs, and so on; but always at the head of them all\r\nstood the Sand-man, whose picture I scribbled in the most extraordinary\r\nand repulsive forms with both chalk and coal everywhere, on the tables,\r\nand cupboard doors, and walls. When I was ten years old my mother\r\nremoved me from the nursery into a little chamber off the corridor not\r\nfar from my father's room. We still had to withdraw hastily whenever,\r\non the stroke of nine, the mysterious unknown was heard in the house.\r\nAs I lay in my little chamber I could hear him go into father's room,\r\nand soon afterwards I fancied there was a fine and peculiar smelling\r\nsteam spreading itself through the house. As my curiosity waxed\r\nstronger, my resolve to make somehow or other the Sand-man's\r\nacquaintance took deeper root. Often when my mother had gone past, I\r\nslipped quickly out of my room into the corridor, but I could never see\r\nanything, for always before I could reach the place where I could get\r\nsight of him, the Sand-man was well inside the door. At last, unable to\r\nresist the impulse any longer, I determined to conceal myself in\r\nfather's room and there wait for the Sand-man.\r\n\r\nOne evening I perceived from my father's silence and mother's sadness\r\nthat the Sand-man would come; accordingly, pleading that I was\r\nexcessively tired, I left the room before nine o'clock and concealed\r\nmyself in a hiding-place close beside the door. The street door\r\ncreaked, and slow, heavy, echoing steps crossed the passage towards\r\nthe stairs. Mother hurried past me with my brothers and sisters.\r\nSoftly--softly--I opened father's room door. He sat as usual, silent\r\nand motionless, with his back towards it; he did not hear me; and in a\r\nmoment I was in and behind a curtain drawn before my father's open\r\nwardrobe, which stood just inside the room. Nearer and nearer and\r\nnearer came the echoing footsteps. There was a strange coughing and\r\nshuffling and mumbling outside. My heart beat with expectation and\r\nfear. A quick step now close, close beside the door, a noisy rattle of\r\nthe handle, and the door flies open with a bang. Recovering my courage\r\nwith an effort, I take a cautious peep out. In the middle of the room\r\nin front of my father stands the Sand-man, the bright light of the lamp\r\nfalling full upon his face. The Sand-man, the terrible Sand-man, is the\r\nold advocate _Coppelius_ who often comes to dine with us.\r\n\r\nBut the most hideous figure could not have awakened greater trepidation\r\nin my heart than this Coppelius did. Picture to yourself a large\r\nbroad-shouldered man, with an immensely big head, a face the colour of\r\nyellow-ochre, grey bushy eyebrows, from beneath which two piercing,\r\ngreenish, cat-like eyes glittered, and a prominent Roman nose hanging\r\nover his upper lip. His distorted mouth was often screwed up into a\r\nmalicious smile; then two dark-red spots appeared on his cheeks, and a\r\nstrange hissing noise proceeded from between his tightly clenched\r\nteeth. He always wore an ash-grey coat of an old-fashioned cut, a\r\nwaistcoat of the same, and nether extremities to match, but black\r\nstockings and buckles set with stones on his shoes. His little wig\r\nscarcely extended beyond the crown of his head, his hair was curled\r\nround high up above his big red ears, and plastered to his temples with\r\ncosmetic, and a broad closed hair-bag stood out prominently from his\r\nneck, so that you could see the silver buckle that fastened his folded\r\nneck-cloth. Altogether he was a most disagreeable and horribly ugly\r\nfigure; but what we children detested most of all was his big coarse\r\nhairy hands; we could never fancy anything that he had once touched.\r\nThis he had noticed; and so, whenever our good mother quietly placed a\r\npiece of cake or sweet fruit on our plates, he delighted to touch it\r\nunder some pretext or other, until the bright tears stood in our eyes,\r\nand from disgust and loathing we lost the enjoyment of the tit-bit that\r\nwas intended to please us. And he did just the same thing when father\r\ngave us a glass of sweet wine on holidays. Then he would quickly pass\r\nhis hand over it, or even sometimes raise the glass to his blue lips,\r\nand he laughed quite sardonically when all we dared do was to express\r\nour vexation in stifled sobs. He habitually called us the \"little\r\nbrutes;\" and when he was present we might not utter a sound; and we\r\ncursed the ugly spiteful man who deliberately and intentionally spoilt\r\nall our little pleasures. Mother seemed to dislike this hateful\r\nCoppelius as much as we did; for as soon as he appeared her\r\ncheerfulness and bright and natural manner were transformed into sad,\r\ngloomy seriousness. Father treated him as if he were a being of some\r\nhigher race, whose ill-manners were to be tolerated, whilst no efforts\r\nought to be spared to keep him in good-humour. He had only to give a\r\nslight hint, and his favourite dishes were cooked for him and rare wine\r\nuncorked.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I saw this Coppelius, therefore, the fearful and hideous\r\nthought arose in my mind that he, and he alone, must be the Sand-man;\r\nbut I no longer conceived of the Sand-man as the bugbear in the\r\nold nurse's fable, who fetched children's eyes and took them to the\r\nhalf-moon as food for his little ones--no! but as an ugly spectre-like\r\nfiend bringing trouble and misery and ruin, both temporal and\r\neverlasting, everywhere wherever he appeared.\r\n\r\nI was spell-bound on the spot. At the risk of being discovered, and, as\r\nI well enough knew, of being severely punished, I remained as I was,\r\nwith my head thrust through the curtains listening. My father received\r\nCoppelius in a ceremonious manner. \"Come, to work!\" cried the latter,\r\nin a hoarse snarling voice, throwing off his coat. Gloomily and\r\nsilently my father took off his dressing-gown, and both put on long\r\nblack smock-frocks. Where they took them from I forgot to notice.\r\nFather opened the folding-doors of a cupboard in the wall; but I saw\r\nthat what I had so long taken to be a cupboard was really a dark\r\nrecess, in which was a little hearth. Coppelius approached it, and a\r\nblue flame crackled upwards from it. Round about were all kinds of\r\nstrange utensils. Good God! as my old father bent down over the fire\r\nhow different he looked! His gentle and venerable features seemed to be\r\ndrawn up by some dreadful convulsive pain into an ugly, repulsive\r\nSatanic mask. He looked like Coppelius. Coppelius plied the red-hot\r\ntongs and drew bright glowing masses out of the thick smoke and began\r\nassiduously to hammer them. I fancied that there were men's faces\r\nvisible round about, but without eyes, having ghastly deep black holes\r\nwhere the eyes should have been. \"Eyes here! Eyes here!\" cried\r\nCoppelius, in a hollow sepulchral voice. My blood ran cold with horror;\r\nI screamed and tumbled out of my hiding-place into the floor. Coppelius\r\nimmediately seized upon me. \"You little brute! You little brute!\" he\r\nbleated, grinding his teeth. Then, snatching me up, he threw me on\r\nthe hearth, so that the flames began to singe my hair. \"Now we've got\r\neyes--eyes--a beautiful pair of children's eyes,\" he whispered, and,\r\nthrusting his hands into the flames he took out some red-hot grains and\r\nwas about to strew them into my eyes. Then my father clasped his hands\r\nand entreated him, saying, \"Master, master, let my Nathanael keep his\r\neyes--oh! do let him keep them.\" Coppelius laughed shrilly and replied,\r\n\"Well then, the boy may keep his eyes and whine and pule his way\r\nthrough the world; but we will now at any rate observe the mechanism of\r\nthe hand and the foot.\" And therewith he roughly laid hold upon me, so\r\nthat my joints cracked, and twisted my hands and my feet, pulling them\r\nnow this way, and now that, \"That's not quite right altogether! It's\r\nbetter as it was!--the old fellow knew what he was about.\" Thus lisped\r\nand hissed Coppelius; but all around me grew black and dark; a sudden\r\nconvulsive pain shot through all my nerves and bones; I knew nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI felt a soft warm breath fanning my cheek; I awakened as if out of the\r\nsleep of death; my mother was bending over me. \"Is the Sand-man still\r\nthere?\" I stammered. \"No, my dear child; he's been gone a long, long\r\ntime; he'll not hurt you.\" Thus spoke my mother, as she kissed her\r\nrecovered darling and pressed him to her heart. But why should I tire\r\nyou, my dear Lothair? why do I dwell at such length on these details,\r\nwhen there's so much remains to be said? Enough--I was detected in my\r\neavesdropping, and roughly handled by Coppelius. Fear and terror had\r\nbrought on a violent fever, of which I lay ill several weeks. \"Is the\r\nSand-man still there?\" these were the first words I uttered on coming\r\nto myself again, the first sign of my recovery, of my safety. Thus, you\r\nsee, I have only to relate to you the most terrible moment of my youth\r\nfor you to thoroughly understand that it must not be ascribed to the\r\nweakness of my eyesight if all that I see is colourless, but to the\r\nfact that a mysterious destiny has hung a dark veil of clouds about my\r\nlife, which I shall perhaps only break through when I die.\r\n\r\nCoppelius did not show himself again; it was reported he had left the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nIt was about a year later when, in pursuance of the old unchanged\r\ncustom, we sat around the round table in the evening. Father was in\r\nvery good spirits, and was telling us amusing tales about his youthful\r\ntravels. As it was striking nine we all at once heard the street door\r\ncreak on its hinges, and slow ponderous steps echoed across the passage\r\nand up the stairs. \"That is Coppelius,\" said my mother, turning pale.\r\n\"Yes, it is Coppelius,\" replied my father in a faint broken voice. The\r\ntears started from my mother's eyes. \"But, father, father,\" she cried,\r\n\"must it be so?\" \"This is the last time,\" he replied; \"this is the\r\nlast time he will come to me, I promise you. Go now, go and take the\r\nchildren. Go, go to bed--good-night.\"\r\n\r\nAs for me, I felt as if I were converted into cold, heavy stone; I\r\ncould not get my breath. As I stood there immovable my mother seized me\r\nby the arm. \"Come, Nathanael! do come along!\" I suffered myself to be\r\nled away; I went into my room. \"Be a good boy and keep quiet,\" mother\r\ncalled after me; \"get into bed and go to sleep.\" But, tortured by\r\nindescribable fear and uneasiness, I could not close my eyes. That\r\nhateful, hideous Coppelius stood before me with his glittering eyes,\r\nsmiling maliciously down upon me; in vain did I strive to banish the\r\nimage. Somewhere about midnight there was a terrific crack, as if a\r\ncannon were being fired off. The whole house shook; something went\r\nrustling and clattering past my door; the house-door was pulled to with\r\na bang. \"That is Coppelius,\" I cried, terror-struck, and leapt out of\r\nbed. Then I heard a wild heartrending scream; I rushed into my father's\r\nroom; the door stood open, and clouds of suffocating smoke came rolling\r\ntowards me. The servant-maid shouted, \"Oh! my master! my master!\" On\r\nthe floor in front of the smoking hearth lay my father, dead, his face\r\nburned black and fearfully distorted, my sisters weeping and moaning\r\naround him, and my mother lying near them in a swoon. \"Coppelius, you\r\natrocious fiend, you've killed my father,\" I shouted. My senses left\r\nme. Two days later, when my father was placed in his coffin, his\r\nfeatures were mild and gentle again as they had been when he was alive.\r\nI found great consolation in the thought that his association with the\r\ndiabolical Coppelius could not have ended in his everlasting ruin.\r\n\r\nOur neighbours had been awakened by the explosion; the affair got\r\ntalked about, and came before the magisterial authorities, who wished\r\nto cite Coppelius to clear himself. But he had disappeared from the\r\nplace, leaving no traces behind him.\r\n\r\nNow when I tell you, my dear friend, that the weather-glass hawker I\r\nspoke of was the villain Coppelius, you will not blame me for seeing\r\nimpending mischief in his inauspicious reappearance. He was differently\r\ndressed; but Coppelius's figure and features are too deeply impressed\r\nupon my mind for me to be capable of making a mistake in the matter.\r\nMoreover, he has not even changed his name. He proclaims himself here,\r\nI learn, to be a Piedmontese mechanician, and styles himself Giuseppe\r\nCoppola.\r\n\r\nI am resolved to enter the lists against him and revenge my father's\r\ndeath, let the consequences be what they may.\r\n\r\nDon't say a word to mother about the reappearance of this odious\r\nmonster. Give my love to my darling Clara; I will write to her when I\r\nam in a somewhat calmer frame of mind. Adieu, &c.\r\n\r\n                         *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n                          CLARA TO NATHANAEL.\r\n\r\nYou are right, you have not written to me for a very long time, but\r\nnevertheless I believe that I still retain a place in your mind and\r\nthoughts. It is a proof that you were thinking a good deal about me\r\nwhen you were sending off your last letter to brother Lothair, for\r\ninstead of directing it to him you directed it to me. With joy I tore\r\nopen the envelope, and did not perceive the mistake until I read the\r\nwords, \"Oh! my dear, dear Lothair.\" Now I know I ought not to have read\r\nany more of the letter, but ought to have given it to my brother. But\r\nas you have so often in innocent raillery made it a sort of reproach\r\nagainst me that I possessed such a calm, and, for a woman, cool-headed\r\ntemperament that I should be like the woman we read of--if the house\r\nwas threatening to tumble down, I should, before hastily fleeing, stop\r\nto smooth down a crumple in the window-curtains--I need hardly tell you\r\nthat the beginning of your letter quite upset me. I could scarcely\r\nbreathe; there was a bright mist before my eyes. Oh! my darling\r\nNathanael! what could this terrible thing be that had happened?\r\nSeparation from you--never to see you again, the thought was like a\r\nsharp knife in my heart. I read on and on. Your description of that\r\nhorrid Coppelius made my flesh creep. I now learnt for the first time\r\nwhat a terrible and violent death your good old father died. Brother\r\nLothair, to whom I handed over his property, sought to comfort me, but\r\nwith little success. That horrid weather-glass hawker Giuseppe Coppola\r\nfollowed me everywhere; and I am almost ashamed to confess it, but he\r\nwas able to disturb my sound and in general calm sleep with all sorts\r\nof wonderful dream-shapes. But soon--the next day--I saw everything in\r\na different light. Oh! do not be angry with me, my best-beloved, if,\r\ndespite your strange presentiment that Coppelius will do you some\r\nmischief, Lothair tells you I am in quite as good spirits, and just the\r\nsame as ever.\r\n\r\nI will frankly confess, it seems to me that all that was fearsome and\r\nterrible of which you speak, existed only in your own self, and that\r\nthe real true outer world had but little to do with it. I can quite\r\nadmit that old Coppelius may have been highly obnoxious to you\r\nchildren, but your real detestation of him arose from the fact that he\r\nhated children.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough the gruesome Sand-man of the old nurse's story was\r\nassociated in your childish mind with old Coppelius, who, even though\r\nyou had not believed in the Sand-man, would have been to you a ghostly\r\nbugbear, especially dangerous to children. His mysterious labours along\r\nwith your father at night-time were, I daresay, nothing more than\r\nsecret experiments in alchemy, with which your mother could not be over\r\nwell pleased, owing to the large sums of money that most likely were\r\nthrown away upon them; and besides, your father, his mind full of the\r\ndeceptive striving after higher knowledge, may probably have become\r\nrather indifferent to his family, as so often happens in the case of\r\nsuch experimentalists. So also it is equally probable that your father\r\nbrought about his death by his own imprudence, and that Coppelius is\r\nnot to blame for it. I must tell you that yesterday I asked our\r\nexperienced neighbour, the chemist, whether in experiments of this kind\r\nan explosion could take place which would have a momentarily fatal\r\neffect. He said, \"Oh, certainly!\" and described to me in his prolix and\r\ncircumstantial way how it could be occasioned, mentioning at the same\r\ntime so many strange and funny words that I could not remember them at\r\nall. Now I know you will be angry at your Clara, and will say, \"Of the\r\nMysterious which often clasps man in its invisible arms there's not a\r\nray can find its way into this cold heart. She sees only the varied\r\nsurface of the things of the world, and, like the little child, is\r\npleased with the golden glittering fruit; at the kernel of which lies\r\nthe fatal poison.\"\r\n\r\nOh! my beloved Nathanael, do you believe then that the intuitive\r\nprescience of a dark power working within us to our own ruin cannot\r\nexist also in minds which are cheerful, natural, free from care? But\r\nplease forgive me that I, a simple girl, presume in any way to indicate\r\nto you what I really think of such an inward strife. After all, I\r\nshould not find the proper words, and you would only laugh at me, not\r\nbecause my thoughts were stupid, but because I was so foolish as to\r\nattempt to tell them to you.\r\n\r\nIf there is a dark and hostile power which traitorously fixes a thread\r\nin our hearts in order that, laying hold of it and drawing us by means\r\nof it along a dangerous road to ruin, which otherwise we should not\r\nhave trod--if, I say, there is such a power, it must assume within us a\r\nform like ourselves, nay, it must be ourselves; for only in that way\r\ncan we believe in it, and only so understood do we yield to it so far\r\nthat it is able to accomplish its secret purpose. So long as we have\r\nsufficient firmness, fortified by cheerfulness, to always acknowledge\r\nforeign hostile influences for what they really are, whilst we quietly\r\npursue the path pointed out to us by both inclination and calling, then\r\nthis mysterious power perishes in its futile struggles to attain the\r\nform which is to be the reflected image of ourselves. It is also\r\ncertain, Lothair adds, that if we have once voluntarily given ourselves\r\nup to this dark physical power, it often reproduces within us the\r\nstrange forms which the outer world throws in our way, so that thus it\r\nis we ourselves who engender within ourselves the spirit which by some\r\nremarkable delusion we imagine to speak in that outer form. It is the\r\nphantom of our own self whose intimate relationship with, and whose\r\npowerful influence upon our soul either plunges us into hell or\r\nelevates us to heaven. Thus you will see, my beloved Nathanael, that I\r\nand brother Lothair have well talked over the subject of dark powers\r\nand forces; and now, after I have with some difficulty written down the\r\nprincipal results of our discussion, they seem to me to contain many\r\nreally profound thoughts. Lothair's last words, however, I don't quite\r\nunderstand altogether; I only dimly guess what he means; and yet I\r\ncannot help thinking it is all very true, I beg you, dear, strive to\r\nforget the ugly advocate Coppelius as well as the weather-glass hawker\r\nGiuseppe Coppola. Try and convince yourself that these foreign\r\ninfluences can have no power over you, that it is only the belief in\r\ntheir hostile power which can in reality make them dangerous to you. If\r\nevery line of your letter did not betray the violent excitement of your\r\nmind, and if I did not sympathise with your condition from the bottom\r\nof my heart, I could in truth jest about the advocate Sand-man and\r\nweather-glass hawker Coppelius. Pluck up your spirits! Be cheerful! I\r\nhave resolved to appear to you as your guardian-angel if that ugly man\r\nCoppola should dare take it into his head to bother you in your dreams,\r\nand drive him away with a good hearty laugh. I'm not afraid of him and\r\nhis nasty hands, not the least little bit; I won't let him either as\r\nadvocate spoil any dainty tit-bit I've taken, or as Sand-man rob me of\r\nmy eyes.\r\n                               My darling, darling Nathanael,\r\n                                         Eternally your, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n                         NATHANAEL TO LOTHAIR.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry that Clara opened and read my last letter to you; of\r\ncourse the mistake is to be attributed to my own absence of mind. She\r\nhas written me a very deep philosophical letter, proving conclusively\r\nthat Coppelius and Coppola only exist in my own mind and are phantoms\r\nof my own self, which will at once be dissipated, as soon as I look\r\nupon them in that light. In very truth one can hardly believe that the\r\nmind which so often sparkles in those bright, beautifully smiling,\r\nchildlike eyes of hers like a sweet lovely dream could draw such subtle\r\nand scholastic distinctions. She also mentions your name. You have been\r\ntalking about me. I suppose you have been giving her lectures, since\r\nshe sifts and refines everything so acutely. But enough of this!\r\nI must now tell you it is most certain that the weather-glass hawker\r\nGiuseppe Coppola is not the advocate Coppelius. I am attending the\r\nlectures of our recently appointed Professor of Physics, who, like the\r\ndistinguished naturalist,[3] is called Spalanzani, and is of Italian\r\norigin. He has known Coppola for many years; and it is also easy to\r\ntell from his accent that he really is a Piedmontese. Coppelius was a\r\nGerman, though no honest German, I fancy. Nevertheless I am not quite\r\nsatisfied. You and Clara will perhaps take me for a gloomy dreamer, but\r\nnohow can I get rid of the impression which Coppelius's cursed face\r\nmade upon me. I am glad to learn from Spalanzani that he has left the\r\ntown. This Professor Spalanzani is a very queer fish. He is a little\r\nfat man, with prominent cheek-bones, thin nose, projecting lips, and\r\nsmall piercing eyes. You cannot get a better picture of him than by\r\nturning over one of the Berlin pocket-almanacs[4] and looking at\r\nCagliostro's[5] portrait engraved by Chodowiecki;[6] Spalanzani looks\r\njust like him.\r\n\r\nOnce lately, as I went up the steps to his house, I perceived that\r\nbeside the curtain which generally covered a glass door there was a\r\nsmall chink. What it was that excited my curiosity I cannot explain;\r\nbut I looked through. In the room I saw a female, tall, very slender,\r\nbut of perfect proportions, and splendidly dressed, sitting at a little\r\ntable, on which she had placed both her arms, her hands being folded\r\ntogether. She sat opposite the door, so that I could easily see her\r\nangelically beautiful face. She did not appear to notice me, and there\r\nwas moreover a strangely fixed look about her eyes, I might almost say\r\nthey appeared as if they had no power of vision; I thought she was\r\nsleeping with her eyes open. I felt quite uncomfortable, and so I\r\nslipped away quietly into the Professor's lecture-room, which was close\r\nat hand. Afterwards I learnt that the figure which I had seen was\r\nSpalanzani's daughter, Olimpia, whom he keeps locked in a most wicked\r\nand unaccountable way, and no man is ever allowed to come near her.\r\nPerhaps, however, there is after all, something peculiar about her;\r\nperhaps she's an idiot or something of that sort. But why am I telling\r\nyou all this? I could have told you it all better and more in detail\r\nwhen I see you. For in a fortnight I shall be amongst you. I must\r\nsee my dear sweet angel, my Clara, again. Then the little bit of\r\nill-temper, which, I must confess, took possession of me after her\r\nfearfully sensible letter, will be blown away. And that is the reason\r\nwhy I am not writing to her as well to-day. With all best wishes, &c.\r\n\r\n                         *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nNothing more strange and extraordinary can be imagined, gracious\r\nreader, than what happened to my poor friend, the young student\r\nNathanael, and which I have undertaken to relate to you. Have you ever\r\nlived to experience anything that completely took possession of your\r\nheart and mind and thoughts to the utter exclusion of everything else?\r\nAll was seething and boiling within you; your blood, heated to fever\r\npitch, leapt through your veins and inflamed your cheeks. Your gaze was\r\nso peculiar, as if seeking to grasp in empty space forms not seen of\r\nany other eye, and all your words ended in sighs betokening some\r\nmystery. Then your friends asked you, \"What is the matter with you, my\r\ndear friend? What do you see?\" And, wishing to describe the inner\r\npictures in all their vivid colours, with their lights and their\r\nshades, you in vain struggled to find words with which to express\r\nyourself. But you felt as if you must gather up all the events that had\r\nhappened, wonderful, splendid, terrible, jocose, and awful, in the very\r\nfirst word, so that the whole might be revealed by a single electric\r\ndischarge, so to speak. Yet every word and all that partook of the\r\nnature of communication by intelligible sounds seemed to be\r\ncolourless, cold, and dead. Then you try and try again, and stutter and\r\nstammer, whilst your friends' prosy questions strike like icy winds\r\nupon your heart's hot fire until they extinguish it. But if, like a\r\nbold painter, you had first sketched in a few audacious strokes the\r\noutline of the picture you had in your soul, you would then easily have\r\nbeen able to deepen and intensify the colours one after the other,\r\nuntil the varied throng of living figures carried your friends away,\r\nand they, like you, saw themselves in the midst of the scene that had\r\nproceeded out of your own soul.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, indulgent reader, I must indeed confess to you,\r\nnobody has asked me for the history of young Nathanael; but you are\r\nvery well aware that I belong to that remarkable class of authors who,\r\nwhen they are bearing anything about in their minds in the manner I\r\nhave just described, feel as if everybody who comes near them, and also\r\nthe whole world to boot, were asking, \"Oh! what is it? Oh! do tell us,\r\nmy good sir?\" Hence I was most powerfully impelled to narrate to you\r\nNathanael's ominous life. My soul was full of the elements of wonder\r\nand extraordinary peculiarity in it; but, for this very reason, and\r\nbecause it was necessary in the very beginning to dispose you,\r\nindulgent reader, to bear with what is fantastic--and that is not a\r\nlittle thing--I racked my brain to find a way of commencing the story\r\nin a significant and original manner, calculated to arrest your\r\nattention. To begin with \"Once upon a time,\" the best beginning for a\r\nstory, seemed to me too tame; with \"In the small country town S----\r\nlived,\" rather better, at any rate allowing plenty of room to work up\r\nto the climax; or to plunge at once _in medias res_, \"'Go to the\r\ndevil!' cried the student Nathanael, his eyes blazing wildly with rage\r\nand fear, when the weather-glass hawker Giuseppe Coppola\"--well, that\r\nis what I really had written, when I thought I detected something of\r\nthe ridiculous in Nathanael's wild glance; and the history is anything\r\nbut laughable. I could not find any words which seemed fitted to\r\nreflect in even the feeblest degree the brightness of the colours of my\r\nmental vision. I determined not to begin at all. So I pray you,\r\ngracious reader, accept the three letters which my friend Lothair has\r\nbeen so kind as to communicate to me as the outline of the picture,\r\ninto which I will endeavour to introduce more and more colour as I\r\nproceed with my narrative. Perhaps, like a good portrait-painter, I may\r\nsucceed in depicting more than one figure in such wise that you will\r\nrecognise it as a good likeness without being acquainted with the\r\noriginal, and feel as if you had very often seen the original with your\r\nown bodily eyes. Perhaps, too, you will then believe that nothing is\r\nmore wonderful, nothing more fantastic than real life, and that all\r\nthat a writer can do is to present it as a dark reflection from a dim\r\ncut mirror.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the very commencement more intelligible, it is\r\nnecessary to add to the letters that, soon after the death of\r\nNathanael's father, Clara and Lothair, the children of a distant\r\nrelative, who had likewise died, leaving them orphans, were taken by\r\nNathanael's mother into her own house. Clara and Nathanael conceived a\r\nwarm affection for each other, against which not the slightest\r\nobjection in the world could be urged. When therefore Nathanael left\r\nhome to prosecute his studies in G----, they were betrothed. It is from\r\nG---- that his last letter is written, where he is attending the\r\nlectures of Spalanzani, the distinguished Professor of Physics.\r\n\r\nI might now proceed comfortably with my narration, did not at this\r\nmoment Clara's image rise up so vividly before my eyes that I cannot\r\nturn them away from it, just as I never could when she looked upon me\r\nand smiled so sweetly. Nowhere would she have passed for beautiful;\r\nthat was the unanimous opinion of all who professed to have any\r\ntechnical knowledge of beauty. But whilst architects praised the pure\r\nproportions of her figure and form, painters averred that her neck,\r\nshoulders, and bosom were almost too chastely modelled, and yet, on the\r\nother hand, one and all were in love with her glorious Magdalene hair,\r\nand talked a good deal of nonsense about Battoni-like[7] colouring. One\r\nof them, a veritable romanticist, strangely enough likened her eyes to\r\na lake by Ruisdael,[8] in which is reflected the pure azure of the\r\ncloudless sky, the beauty of woods and flowers, and all the bright and\r\nvaried life of a living landscape. Poets and musicians went still\r\nfurther and said, \"What's all this talk about seas and reflections? How\r\ncan we look upon the girl without feeling that wonderful heavenly songs\r\nand melodies beam upon us from her eyes, penetrating deep down into our\r\nhearts, till all becomes awake and throbbing with emotion? And if we\r\ncannot sing anything at all passable then, why, we are not worth much;\r\nand this we can also plainly read in the rare smile which flits around\r\nher lips when we have the hardihood to squeak out something in her\r\npresence which we pretend to call singing, in spite of the fact that it\r\nis nothing more than a few single notes confusedly linked together.\"\r\nAnd it really was so. Clara had the powerful fancy of a bright,\r\ninnocent, unaffected child, a woman's deep and sympathetic heart, and\r\nan understanding clear, sharp, and discriminating. Dreamers and\r\nvisionaries had but a bad time of it with her; for without saying very\r\nmuch--she was not by nature of a talkative disposition--she plainly\r\nasked, by her calm steady look, and rare ironical smile, \"How can you\r\nimagine, my dear friends, that I can take these fleeting shadowy images\r\nfor true living and breathing forms?\" For this reason many found fault\r\nwith her as being cold, prosaic, and devoid of feeling; others,\r\nhowever, who had reached a clearer and deeper conception of life, were\r\nextremely fond of the intelligent, childlike, large-hearted girl But\r\nnone had such an affection for her as Nathanael, who was a zealous and\r\ncheerful cultivator of the fields of science and art. Clara clung to\r\nher lover with all her heart; the first clouds she encountered in life\r\nwere when he had to separate from her. With what delight did she fly\r\ninto his arms when, as he had promised in his last letter to Lothair,\r\nhe really came back to his native town and entered his mother's room!\r\nAnd as Nathanael had foreseen, the moment he saw Clara again he no\r\nlonger thought about either the advocate Coppelius or her sensible\r\nletter; his ill-humour had quite disappeared.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Nathanael was right when he told his friend Lothair that\r\nthe repulsive vendor of weather-glasses, Coppola, had exercised a fatal\r\nand disturbing influence upon his life. It was quite patent to all; for\r\neven during the first few days he showed that he was completely and\r\nentirely changed. He gave himself up to gloomy reveries, and moreover\r\nacted so strangely; they had never observed anything at all like it in\r\nhim before. Everything, even his own life, was to him but dreams and\r\npresentiments. His constant theme was that every man who delusively\r\nimagined himself to be free was merely the plaything of the cruel sport\r\nof mysterious powers, and it was vain for man to resist them; he must\r\nhumbly submit to whatever destiny had decreed for him. He went so far\r\nas to maintain that it was foolish to believe that a man could do\r\nanything in art or science of his own accord; for the inspiration in\r\nwhich alone any true artistic work could be done did not proceed from\r\nthe spirit within outwards, but was the result of the operation\r\ndirected inwards of some Higher Principle existing without and beyond\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nThis mystic extravagance was in the highest degree repugnant to Clara's\r\nclear intelligent mind, but it seemed vain to enter upon any attempt at\r\nrefutation. Yet when Nathanael went on to prove that Coppelius was the\r\nEvil Principle which had entered into him and taken possession of him\r\nat the time he was listening behind the curtain, and that this hateful\r\ndemon would in some terrible way ruin their happiness, then Clara grew\r\ngrave and said, \"Yes, Nathanael. You are right; Coppelius is an Evil\r\nPrinciple; he can do dreadful things, as bad as could a Satanic power\r\nwhich should assume a living physical form, but only--only if you do\r\nnot banish him from your mind and thoughts. So long as you believe in\r\nhim he exists and is at work; your belief in him is his only power.\"\r\nWhereupon Nathanael, quite angry because Clara would only grant the\r\nexistence of the demon in his own mind, began to dilate at large upon\r\nthe whole mystic doctrine of devils and awful powers, but Clara\r\nabruptly broke off the theme by making, to Nathanael's very great\r\ndisgust, some quite commonplace remark. Such deep mysteries are sealed\r\nbooks to cold, unsusceptible characters, he thought, without being\r\nclearly conscious to himself that he counted Clara amongst these\r\ninferior natures, and accordingly he did not remit his efforts to\r\ninitiate her into these mysteries. In the morning, when she was helping\r\nto prepare breakfast, he would take his stand beside her, and read all\r\nsorts of mystic books to her, until she begged him--\"But, my dear\r\nNathanael, I shall have to scold you as the Evil Principle which\r\nexercises a fatal influence upon my coffee. For if I do as you wish,\r\nand let things go their own way, and look into your eyes whilst you\r\nread, the coffee will all boil over into the fire, and you will none of\r\nyou get any breakfast.\" Then Nathanael hastily banged the book to and\r\nran away in great displeasure to his own room.\r\n\r\nFormerly he had possessed a peculiar talent for writing pleasing,\r\nsparkling tales, which Clara took the greatest delight in listening to;\r\nbut now his productions were gloomy, unintelligible, and wanting in\r\nform, so that, although Clara out of forbearance towards him did not\r\nsay so, he nevertheless felt how very little interest she took in them.\r\nThere was nothing that Clara disliked so much as what was tedious; at\r\nsuch times her intellectual sleepiness was not to be overcome; it was\r\nbetrayed both in her glances and in her words. Nathanael's effusions\r\nwere, in truth, exceedingly tedious. His ill-humour at Clara's cold\r\nprosaic temperament continued to increase; Clara could not conceal her\r\ndistaste of his dark, gloomy, wearying mysticism; and thus both began\r\nto be more and more estranged from each other without exactly being\r\naware of it themselves. The image of the ugly Coppelius had, as\r\nNathanael was obliged to confess to himself, faded considerably in his\r\nfancy, and it often cost him great pains to present him in vivid\r\ncolours in his literary efforts, in which he played the part of the\r\nghoul of Destiny. At length it entered into his head to make his dismal\r\npresentiment that Coppelius would ruin his happiness the subject of a\r\npoem. He made himself and Clara, united by true love, the central\r\nfigures, but represented a black hand as being from time to time thrust\r\ninto their life and plucking out a joy that had blossomed for them. At\r\nlength, as they were standing at the altar, the terrible Coppelius\r\nappeared and touched Clara's lovely eyes, which leapt into Nathanael's\r\nown bosom, burning and hissing like bloody sparks. Then Coppelius laid\r\nhold upon him, and hurled him into a blazing circle of fire, which spun\r\nround with the speed of a whirlwind, and, storming and blustering,\r\ndashed away with him. The fearful noise it made was like a furious\r\nhurricane lashing the foaming sea-waves until they rise up like black,\r\nwhite-headed giants in the midst of the raging struggle. But through\r\nthe midst of the savage fury of the tempest he heard Clara's voice\r\ncalling, \"Can you not see me, dear? Coppelius has deceived you; they\r\nwere not my eyes which burned so in your bosom; they were fiery drops\r\nof your own heart's blood. Look at me, I have got my own eyes still.\"\r\nNathanael thought, \"Yes, that is Clara, and I am hers for ever.\" Then\r\nthis thought laid a powerful grasp upon the fiery circle so that it\r\nstood still, and the riotous turmoil died away rumbling down a dark\r\nabyss. Nathanael looked into Clara's eyes; but it was death whose gaze\r\nrested so kindly upon him.\r\n\r\nWhilst Nathanael was writing this work he was very quiet and\r\nsober-minded; he filed and polished every line, and as he had chosen to\r\nsubmit himself to the limitations of metre, he did not rest until all\r\nwas pure and musical. When, however, he had at length finished it and\r\nread it aloud to himself he was seized with horror and awful dread, and\r\nhe screamed, \"Whose hideous voice is this?\" But he soon came to see in\r\nit again nothing beyond a very successful poem, and he confidently\r\nbelieved it would enkindle Clara's cold temperament, though to what end\r\nshe should be thus aroused was not quite clear to his own mind, nor yet\r\nwhat would be the real purpose served by tormenting her with these\r\ndreadful pictures, which prophesied a terrible and ruinous end to her\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nNathanael and Clara sat in his mother's little garden. Clara was bright\r\nand cheerful, since for three entire days her lover, who had been busy\r\nwriting his poem, had not teased her with his dreams or forebodings.\r\nNathanael, too, spoke in a gay and vivacious way of things of merry\r\nimport, as he formerly used to do, so that Clara said, \"Ah! now I have\r\nyou again. We have driven away that ugly Coppelius, you see.\" Then it\r\nsuddenly occurred to him that he had got the poem in his pocket which\r\nhe wished to read to her. He at once took out the manuscript and began\r\nto read. Clara, anticipating something tedious as usual, prepared to\r\nsubmit to the infliction, and calmly resumed her knitting. But as the\r\nsombre clouds rose up darker and darker she let her knitting fall on\r\nher lap and sat with her eyes fixed in a set stare upon Nathanael's\r\nface. He was quite carried away by his own work, the fire of enthusiasm\r\ncoloured his cheeks a deep red, and tears started from his eyes. At\r\nlength he concluded, groaning and showing great lassitude; grasping\r\nClara's hand, he sighed as if he were being utterly melted in\r\ninconsolable grief, \"Oh! Clara! Clara!\" She drew him softly to her\r\nheart and said in a low but very grave and impressive tone, \"Nathanael,\r\nmy darling Nathanael, throw that foolish, senseless, stupid thing into\r\nthe fire.\" Then Nathanael leapt indignantly to his feet, crying, as he\r\npushed Clara from him, \"You damned lifeless automaton!\" and rushed\r\naway. Clara was cut to the heart, and wept bitterly. \"Oh! he has never\r\nloved me, for he does not understand me,\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\nLothair entered the arbour. Clara was obliged to tell him all that had\r\ntaken place. He was passionately fond of his sister; and every word of\r\nher complaint fell like a spark upon his heart, so that the displeasure\r\nwhich he had long entertained against his dreamy friend Nathanael was\r\nkindled into furious anger. He hastened to find Nathanael, and\r\nupbraided him in harsh words for his irrational behaviour towards his\r\nbeloved sister. The fiery Nathanael answered him in the same style. \"A\r\nfantastic, crack-brained fool,\" was retaliated with, \"A miserable,\r\ncommon, everyday sort of fellow.\" A meeting was the inevitable\r\nconsequence. They agreed to meet on the following morning behind the\r\ngarden-wall, and fight, according to the custom of the students of the\r\nplace, with sharp rapiers. They went about silent and gloomy; Clara\r\nhad both heard and seen the violent quarrel, and also observed the\r\nfencing-master bring the rapiers in the dusk of the evening. She had a\r\npresentiment of what was to happen. They both appeared at the appointed\r\nplace wrapped up in the same gloomy silence, and threw off their coats.\r\nTheir eyes flaming with the bloodthirsty light of pugnacity, they were\r\nabout to begin their contest when Clara burst through the garden door.\r\nSobbing, she screamed, \"You savage, terrible men! Cut me down before\r\nyou attack each other; for how can I live when my lover has slain my\r\nbrother, or my brother slain my lover?\" Lothair let his weapon fall and\r\ngazed silently upon the ground, whilst Nathanael's heart was rent with\r\nsorrow, and all the affection which he had felt for his lovely Clara in\r\nthe happiest days of her golden youth was awakened within him. His\r\nmurderous weapon, too, fell from his hand; he threw himself at Clara's\r\nfeet. \"Oh! can you ever forgive me, my only, my dearly loved Clara? Can\r\nyou, my dear brother Lothair, also forgive me?\" Lothair was touched by\r\nhis friend's great distress; the three young people embraced each other\r\namidst endless tears, and swore never again to break their bond of love\r\nand fidelity.\r\n\r\nNathanael felt as if a heavy burden that had been weighing him down to\r\nthe earth was now rolled from off him, nay, as if by offering\r\nresistance to the dark power which had possessed him, he had rescued\r\nhis own self from the ruin which had threatened him. Three happy days\r\nhe now spent amidst the loved ones, and then returned to G----, where\r\nhe had still a year to stay before settling down in his native town for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nEverything having reference to Coppelius had been concealed from the\r\nmother, for they knew she could not think of him without horror, since\r\nshe as well as Nathanael believed him to be guilty of causing her\r\nhusband's death.\r\n\r\n                      *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nWhen Nathanael came to the house where he lived he was greatly\r\nastonished to find it burnt down to the ground, so that nothing but the\r\nbare outer walls were left standing amidst a heap of ruins. Although\r\nthe fire had broken out in the laboratory of the chemist who lived on\r\nthe ground-floor, and had therefore spread upwards, some of Nathanael's\r\nbold, active friends had succeeded in time in forcing a way into his\r\nroom in the upper storey and saving his books and manuscripts and\r\ninstruments. They had carried them all uninjured into another house,\r\nwhere they engaged a room for him; this he now at once took possession\r\nof. That he lived opposite Professor Spalanzani did not strike him\r\nparticularly, nor did it occur to him as anything more singular that he\r\ncould, as he observed, by looking out of his window, see straight into\r\nthe room where Olimpia often sat alone. Her figure he could plainly\r\ndistinguish, although her features were uncertain and confused. It did\r\nat length occur to him, however, that she remained for hours together\r\nin the same position in which he had first discovered her through the\r\nglass door, sitting at a little table without any occupation whatever,\r\nand it was evident that she was constantly gazing across in his\r\ndirection. He could not but confess to himself that he had never seen a\r\nfiner figure. However, with Clara mistress of his heart, he remained\r\nperfectly unaffected by Olimpia's stiffness and apathy; and it was only\r\noccasionally that he sent a fugitive glance over his compendium across\r\nto her--that was all.\r\n\r\nHe was writing to Clara; a light tap came at the door. At his summons\r\nto \"Come in,\" Coppola's repulsive face appeared peeping in. Nathanael\r\nfelt his heart beat with trepidation; but, recollecting what Spalanzani\r\nhad told him about his fellow-countryman Coppola, and what he had\r\nhimself so faithfully promised his beloved in respect to the Sand-man\r\nCoppelius, he was ashamed at himself for this childish fear of\r\nspectres. Accordingly, he controlled himself with an effort, and said,\r\nas quietly and as calmly as he possibly could, \"I don't want to buy any\r\nweather-glasses, my good friend; you had better go elsewhere.\" Then\r\nCoppola came right into the room, and said in a hoarse voice, screwing\r\nup his wide mouth into a hideous smile, whilst his little eyes flashed\r\nkeenly from beneath his long grey eyelashes, \"What! Nee weather-gless?\r\nNee weather-gless? 've got foine oyes as well--foine oyes!\" Affrighted,\r\nNathanael cried, \"You stupid man, how can you have eyes?--eyes--eyes?\"\r\nBut Coppola, laying aside his weather-glasses, thrust his hands into\r\nhis big coat-pockets and brought out several spy-glasses and\r\nspectacles, and put them on the table. \"Theer! Theer! Spect'cles!\r\nSpect'cles to put 'n nose! Them's my oyes--foine oyes.\" And he\r\ncontinued to produce more and more spectacles from his pockets until\r\nthe table began to gleam and flash all over. Thousands of eyes were\r\nlooking and blinking convulsively, and staring up at Nathanael; he\r\ncould not avert his gaze from the table. Coppola went on heaping up his\r\nspectacles, whilst wilder and ever wilder burning flashes crossed\r\nthrough and through each other and darted their blood-red rays into\r\nNathanael's breast. Quite overcome, and frantic with terror, he\r\nshouted, \"Stop! stop! you terrible man!\" and he seized Coppola by the\r\narm, which he had again thrust into his pocket in order to bring out\r\nstill more spectacles, although the whole table was covered all over\r\nwith them. With a harsh disagreeable laugh Coppola gently freed\r\nhimself; and with the words \"So! went none! Well, here foine gless!\"\r\nhe swept all his spectacles together, and put them back into his\r\ncoat-pockets, whilst from a breast-pocket he produced a great number of\r\nlarger and smaller perspectives. As soon as the spectacles were gone\r\nNathanael recovered his equanimity again; and, bending his thoughts\r\nupon Clara, he clearly discerned that the gruesome incubus had\r\nproceeded only from himself, as also that Coppola was a right honest\r\nmechanician and optician, and far from being Coppelius's dreaded double\r\nand ghost And then, besides, none of the glasses which Coppola now\r\nplaced on the table had anything at all singular about them, at least\r\nnothing so weird as the spectacles; so, in order to square accounts\r\nwith himself, Nathanael now really determined to buy something of the\r\nman. He took up a small, very beautifully cut pocket perspective, and\r\nby way of proving it looked through the window. Never before in his\r\nlife had he had a glass in his hands that brought out things so clearly\r\nand sharply and distinctly. Involuntarily he directed the glass upon\r\nSpalanzani's room; Olimpia sat at the little table as usual, her arms\r\nlaid upon it and her hands folded. Now he saw for the first time the\r\nregular and exquisite beauty of her features. The eyes, however, seemed\r\nto him to have a singular look of fixity and lifelesness. But as he\r\ncontinued to look closer and more carefully through the glass he\r\nfancied a light like humid moonbeams came into them. It seemed as if\r\ntheir power of vision was now being enkindled; their glances shone with\r\never-increasing vivacity. Nathanael remained standing at the window as\r\nif glued to the spot by a wizard's spell, his gaze rivetted\r\nunchangeably upon the divinely beautiful Olimpia. A coughing and\r\nshuffling of the feet awakened him out of his enchaining dream, as it\r\nwere. Coppola stood behind him, \"Tre zechini\" (three ducats). Nathanael\r\nhad completely forgotten the optician; he hastily paid the sum\r\ndemanded. \"Ain't 't? Foine gless? foine gless?\" asked Coppola in his\r\nharsh unpleasant voice, smiling sardonically. \"Yes, yes, yes,\" rejoined\r\nNathanael impatiently; \"adieu, my good friend.\" But Coppola did not\r\nleave the room without casting many peculiar side-glances upon\r\nNathanael; and the young student heard him laughing loudly on the\r\nstairs. \"Ah well!\" thought he, \"he's laughing at me because I've paid\r\nhim too much for this little perspective--because I've given him too\r\nmuch money--that's it\" As he softly murmured these words he fancied he\r\ndetected a gasping sigh as of a dying man stealing awfully through the\r\nroom; his heart stopped beating with fear. But to be sure he had heaved\r\na deep sigh himself; it was quite plain. \"Clara is quite right,\" said\r\nhe to himself, \"in holding me to be an incurable ghost-seer; and yet\r\nit's very ridiculous--ay, more than ridiculous, that the stupid thought\r\nof having paid Coppola too much for his glass should cause me this\r\nstrange anxiety; I can't see any reason for it.\"\r\n\r\nNow he sat down to finish his letter to Clara; but a glance through the\r\nwindow showed him Olimpia still in her former posture. Urged by an\r\nirresistible impulse he jumped up and seized Coppola's perspective; nor\r\ncould he tear himself away from the fascinating Olimpia until his\r\nfriend and brother Siegmund called for him to go to Professor\r\nSpalanzani's lecture. The curtains before the door of the all-important\r\nroom were closely drawn, so that he could not see Olimpia. Nor could he\r\neven see her from his own room during the two following days,\r\nnotwithstanding that he scarcely ever left his window, and maintained a\r\nscarce interrupted watch through Coppola's perspective upon her room.\r\nOn the third day curtains even were drawn across the window. Plunged\r\ninto the depths of despair,--goaded by longing and ardent desire, he\r\nhurried outside the walls of the town. Olimpia's image hovered about\r\nhis path in the air and stepped forth out of the bushes, and peeped up\r\nat him with large and lustrous eyes from the bright surface of the\r\nbrook. Clara's image was completely faded from his mind; he had no\r\nthoughts except for Olimpia. He uttered his love-plaints aloud and in a\r\nlachrymose tone, \"Oh! my glorious, noble star of love, have you only\r\nrisen to vanish again, and leave me in the darkness and hopelessness of\r\nnight?\"\r\n\r\nReturning home, he became aware that there was a good deal of noisy\r\nbustle going on in Spalanzani's house. All the doors stood wide open;\r\nmen were taking in all kinds of gear and furniture; the windows of the\r\nfirst floor were all lifted off their hinges; busy maid-servants with\r\nimmense hair-brooms were driving backwards and forwards dusting and\r\nsweeping, whilst within could be heard the knocking and hammering of\r\ncarpenters and upholsterers. Utterly astonished, Nathanael stood still\r\nin the street; then Siegmund joined him, laughing, and said, \"Well,\r\nwhat do you say to our old Spalanzani?\" Nathanael assured him that he\r\ncould not say anything, since he knew not what it all meant; to his\r\ngreat astonishment, he could hear, however, that they were turning the\r\nquiet gloomy house almost inside out with their dusting and cleaning\r\nand making of alterations. Then he learned from Siegmund that\r\nSpalanzani intended giving a great concert and ball on the following\r\nday, and that half the university was invited. It was generally\r\nreported that Spalanzani was going to let his daughter Olimpia, whom he\r\nhad so long so jealously guarded from every eye, make her first\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nNathanael received an invitation. At the appointed hour, when the\r\ncarriages were rolling up and the lights were gleaming brightly in the\r\ndecorated halls, he went across to the Professor's, his heart beating\r\nhigh with expectation. The company was both numerous and brilliant.\r\nOlimpia was richly and tastefully dressed. One could not but admire her\r\nfigure and the regular beauty of her features. The striking inward\r\ncurve of her back, as well as the wasp-like smallness of her waist,\r\nappeared to be the result of too-tight lacing. There was something\r\nstiff and measured in her gait and bearing that made an unfavourable\r\nimpression upon many; it was ascribed to the constraint imposed upon\r\nher by the company. The concert began. Olimpia played on the piano with\r\ngreat skill; and sang as skilfully an _aria di bravura_, in a voice\r\nwhich was, if anything, almost too sharp, but clear as glass bells.\r\nNathanael was transported with delight; he stood in the background\r\nfarthest from her, and owing to the blinding lights could not quite\r\ndistinguish her features. So, without being observed, he took Coppola's\r\nglass out of his pocket, and directed it upon the beautiful Olimpia.\r\nOh! then he perceived how her yearning eyes sought him, how every note\r\nonly reached its full purity in the loving glance which penetrated to\r\nand inflamed his heart. Her artificial _roulades_ seemed to him to be\r\nthe exultant cry towards heaven of the soul refined by love; and when\r\nat last, after the _cadenza_, the long trill rang shrilly and loudly\r\nthrough the hall, he felt as if he were suddenly grasped by burning\r\narms and could no longer control himself,--he could not help shouting\r\naloud in his mingled pain and delight, \"Olimpia!\" All eyes were turned\r\nupon him; many people laughed. The face of the cathedral organist wore\r\na still more gloomy look than it had done before, but all he said was,\r\n\"Very well!\"\r\n\r\nThe concert came to an end, and the ball began. Oh! to dance with\r\nher--with her--that was now the aim of all Nathanael's wishes, of all\r\nhis desires. But how should he have courage to request her, the queen\r\nof the ball, to grant him the honour of a dance? And yet he couldn't\r\ntell how it came about, just as the dance began, he found himself\r\nstanding close beside her, nobody having as yet asked her to be his\r\npartner; so, with some difficulty stammering out a few words, he\r\ngrasped her hand. It was cold as ice; he shook with an awful, frosty\r\nshiver. But, fixing his eyes upon her face, he saw that her glance was\r\nbeaming upon him with love and longing, and at the same moment he\r\nthought that the pulse began to beat in her cold hand, and the warm\r\nlife-blood to course through her veins. And passion burned more\r\nintensely in his own heart also; he threw his arm round her beautiful\r\nwaist and whirled her round the hall. He had always thought that he\r\nkept good and accurate time in dancing, but from the perfectly\r\nrhythmical evenness with which Olimpia danced, and which frequently put\r\nhim quite out, he perceived how very faulty his own time really was.\r\nNotwithstanding, he would not dance with any other lady; and everybody\r\nelse who approached Olimpia to call upon her for a dance, he would have\r\nliked to kill on the spot. This, however, only happened twice; to his\r\nastonishment Olimpia remained after this without a partner, and he\r\nfailed not on each occasion to take her out again. If Nathanael had\r\nbeen able to see anything else except the beautiful Olimpia, there\r\nwould inevitably have been a good deal of unpleasant quarrelling and\r\nstrife; for it was evident that Olimpia was the object of the smothered\r\nlaughter only with difficulty suppressed, which was heard in various\r\ncorners amongst the young people; and they followed her with very\r\ncurious looks, but nobody knew for what reason. Nathanael, excited by\r\ndancing and the plentiful supply of wine he had consumed, had laid\r\naside the shyness which at other times characterised him. He sat beside\r\nOlimpia, her hand in his own, and declared his love enthusiastically\r\nand passionately in words which neither of them understood, neither he\r\nnor Olimpia. And yet she perhaps did, for she sat with her eyes fixed\r\nunchangeably upon his, sighing repeatedly, \"Ach! Ach! Ach!\" Upon this\r\nNathanael would answer, \"Oh, you glorious heavenly lady! You ray from\r\nthe promised paradise of love! Oh! what a profound soul you have! my\r\nwhole being is mirrored in it!\" and a good deal more in the same\r\nstrain. But Olimpia only continued to sigh \"Ach! Ach!\" again and again.\r\n\r\nProfessor Spalanzani passed by the two happy lovers once or twice, and\r\nsmiled with a look of peculiar satisfaction. All at once it seemed to\r\nNathanael, albeit he was far away in a different world, as if it were\r\ngrowing perceptibly darker down below at Professor Spalanzani's. He\r\nlooked about him, and to his very great alarm became aware that there\r\nwere only two lights left burning in the hall, and they were on the\r\npoint of going out. The music and dancing had long ago ceased. \"We must\r\npart--part!\" he cried, wildly and despairingly; he kissed Olimpia's\r\nhand; he bent down to her mouth, but ice-cold lips met his burning\r\nones. As he touched her cold hand, he felt his heart thrilled with awe;\r\nthe legend of \"The Dead Bride\"[9] shot suddenly through his mind. But\r\nOlimpia had drawn him closer to her, and the kiss appeared to warm her\r\nlips into vitality. Professor Spalanzani strode slowly through the\r\nempty apartment, his footsteps giving a hollow echo; and his figure\r\nhad, as the flickering shadows played about him, a ghostly, awful\r\nappearance. \"Do you love me? Do you love me, Olimpia? Only one little\r\nword--Do you love me?\" whispered Nathanael, but she only sighed, \"Ach!\r\nAch!\" as she rose to her feet. \"Yes, you are my lovely, glorious star\r\nof love,\" said Nathanael, \"and will shine for ever, purifying and\r\nennobling my heart\" \"Ach! Ach!\" replied Olimpia, as she moved along.\r\nNathanael followed her; they stood before the Professor. \"You have had\r\nan extraordinarily animated conversation with my daughter,\" said he,\r\nsmiling; \"well, well, my dear Mr. Nathanael, if you find pleasure in\r\ntalking to the stupid girl, I am sure I shall be glad for you to come\r\nand do so.\" Nathanael took his leave, his heart singing and leaping in\r\na perfect delirium of happiness.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days Spalanzani's ball was the general topic of\r\nconversation. Although the Professor had done everything to make the\r\nthing a splendid success, yet certain gay spirits related more than one\r\nthing that had occurred which was quite irregular and out of order.\r\nThey were especially keen in pulling Olimpia to pieces for her\r\ntaciturnity and rigid stiffness; in spite of her beautiful form they\r\nalleged that she was hopelessly stupid, and in this fact they discerned\r\nthe reason why Spalanzani had so long kept her concealed from\r\npublicity. Nathanael heard all this with inward wrath, but nevertheless\r\nhe held his tongue; for, thought he, would it indeed be worth while to\r\nprove to these fellows that it is their own stupidity which prevents\r\nthem from appreciating Olimpia's profound and brilliant parts? One day\r\nSiegmund said to him, \"Pray, brother, have the kindness to tell me\r\nhow you, a sensible fellow, came to lose your head over that Miss\r\nWax-face--that wooden doll across there?\" Nathanael was about to fly\r\ninto a rage, but he recollected himself and replied, \"Tell me,\r\nSiegmund, how came it that Olimpia's divine charms could escape your\r\neye, so keenly alive as it always is to beauty, and your acute\r\nperception as well? But Heaven be thanked for it, otherwise I should\r\nhave had you for a rival, and then the blood of one of us would have\r\nhad to be spilled.\" Siegmund, perceiving how matters stood with his\r\nfriend, skilfully interposed and said, after remarking that all\r\nargument with one in love about the object of his affections was out of\r\nplace, \"Yet it's very strange that several of us have formed pretty\r\nmuch the same opinion about Olimpia. We think she is--you won't take it\r\nill, brother?--that she is singularly statuesque and soulless. Her\r\nfigure is regular, and so are her features, that can't be gainsaid; and\r\nif her eyes were not so utterly devoid of life, I may say, of the power\r\nof vision, she might pass for a beauty. She is strangely measured in\r\nher movements, they all seem as if they were dependent upon some\r\nwound-up clock-work. Her playing and singing has the disagreeably\r\nperfect, but insensitive time of a singing machine, and her dancing is\r\nthe same. We felt quite afraid of this Olimpia, and did not like to\r\nhave anything to do with her; she seemed to us to be only acting _like_\r\na living creature, and as if there was some secret at the bottom of it\r\nall.\" Nathanael did not give way to the bitter feelings which\r\nthreatened to master him at these words of Siegmund's; he fought down\r\nand got the better of his displeasure, and merely said, very earnestly,\r\n\"You cold prosaic fellows may very well be afraid of her. It is only to\r\nits like that the poetically organised spirit unfolds itself. Upon me\r\nalone did her loving glances fall, and through my mind and thoughts\r\nalone did they radiate; and only in her love can I find my own self\r\nagain. Perhaps, however, she doesn't do quite right not to jabber a lot\r\nof nonsense and stupid talk like other shallow people. It is true, she\r\nspeaks but few words; but the few words she docs speak are genuine\r\nhieroglyphs of the inner world of Love and of the higher cognition of\r\nthe intellectual life revealed in the intuition of the Eternal beyond\r\nthe grave. But you have no understanding for all these things, and I am\r\nonly wasting words.\" \"God be with you, brother,\" said Siegmund very\r\ngently, almost sadly, \"but it seems to me that you are in a very bad\r\nway. You may rely upon me, if all--No, I can't say any more.\" It all at\r\nonce dawned upon Nathanael that his cold prosaic friend Siegmund really\r\nand sincerely wished him well, and so he warmly shook his proffered\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nNathanael had completely forgotten that there was a Clara in the world,\r\nwhom he had once loved--and his mother and Lothair. They had all\r\nvanished from his mind; he lived for Olimpia alone. He sat beside her\r\nevery day for hours together, rhapsodising about his love and sympathy\r\nenkindled into life, and about psychic elective affinity[10]--all of\r\nwhich Olimpia listened to with great reverence. He fished up from the\r\nvery bottom of his desk all the things that he had ever written--poems,\r\nfancy sketches, visions, romances, tales, and the heap was increased\r\ndaily with all kinds of aimless sonnets, stanzas, canzonets. All these\r\nhe read to Olimpia hour after hour without growing tired; but then he\r\nhad never had such an exemplary listener. She neither embroidered, nor\r\nknitted; she did not look out of the window, or feed a bird, or play\r\nwith a little pet dog or a favourite cat, neither did she twist a piece\r\nof paper or anything of that kind round her finger; she did not\r\nforcibly convert a yawn into a low affected cough--in short, she sat\r\nhour after hour with her eyes bent unchangeably upon her lover's face,\r\nwithout moving or altering her position, and her gaze grew more ardent\r\nand more ardent still. And it was only when at last Nathanael rose\r\nand kissed her lips or her hand that she said, \"Ach! Ach!\" and then\r\n\"Good-night, dear.\" Arrived in his own room, Nathanael would break out\r\nwith, \"Oh! what a brilliant--what a profound mind! Only you--you alone\r\nunderstand me.\" And his heart trembled with rapture when he reflected\r\nupon the wondrous harmony which daily revealed itself between his own\r\nand his Olimpia's character; for he fancied that she had expressed in\r\nrespect to his works and his poetic genius the identical sentiments\r\nwhich he himself cherished deep down in his own heart in respect to the\r\nsame, and even as if it was his own heart's voice speaking to him. And\r\nit must indeed have been so; for Olimpia never uttered any other words\r\nthan those already mentioned. And when Nathanael himself in his clear\r\nand sober moments, as, for instance, directly after waking in a\r\nmorning, thought about her utter passivity and taciturnity, he only\r\nsaid, \"What are words--but words? The glance of her heavenly eyes says\r\nmore than any tongue of earth. And how can, anyway, a child of heaven\r\naccustom herself to the narrow circle which the exigencies of a\r\nwretched mundane life demand?\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Spalanzani appeared to be greatly pleased at the intimacy\r\nthat had sprung up between his daughter Olimpia and Nathanael, and\r\nshowed the young man many unmistakable proofs of his good feeling\r\ntowards him; and when Nathanael ventured at length to hint very\r\ndelicately at an alliance with Olimpia, the Professor smiled all over\r\nhis face at once, and said he should allow his daughter to make a\r\nperfectly free choice. Encouraged by these words, and with the fire of\r\ndesire burning in his heart, Nathanael resolved the very next day to\r\nimplore Olimpia to tell him frankly, in plain words, what he had long\r\nread in her sweet loving glances,--that she would be his for ever. He\r\nlooked for the ring which his mother had given him at parting; he would\r\npresent it to Olimpia as a symbol of his devotion, and of the happy\r\nlife he was to lead with her from that time onwards. Whilst looking for\r\nit he came across his letters from Clara and Lothair; he threw them\r\ncarelessly aside, found the ring, put it in his pocket, and ran across\r\nto Olimpia. Whilst still on the stairs, in the entrance-passage, he\r\nheard an extraordinary hubbub; the noise seemed to proceed from\r\nSpalanzani's study. There was a stamping--a rattling--pushing--knocking\r\nagainst the door, with curses and oaths intermingled. \"Leave\r\nhold--leave hold--you monster--you rascal--staked your life and honour\r\nupon it?--Ha! ha! ha! ha!--That was not our wager--I, I made the\r\neyes--I the clock-work.--Go to the devil with your clock-work--you\r\ndamned dog of a watch-maker--be off--Satan--stop--you paltry\r\nturner--you infernal beast!--stop--begone--let me go.\" The voices which\r\nwere thus making all this racket and rumpus were those of Spalanzani\r\nand the fearsome Coppelius. Nathanael rushed in, impelled by some\r\nnameless dread. The Professor was grasping a female figure by the\r\nshoulders, the Italian Coppola held her by the feet; and they were\r\npulling and dragging each other backwards and forwards, fighting\r\nfuriously to get possession of her. Nathanael recoiled with horror on\r\nrecognising that the figure was Olimpia. Boiling with rage, he was\r\nabout to tear his beloved from the grasp of the madmen, when Coppola by\r\nan extraordinary exertion of strength twisted the figure out of the\r\nProfessor's hands and gave him such a terrible blow with her, that he\r\nreeled backwards and fell over the table all amongst the phials and\r\nretorts, the bottles and glass cylinders, which covered it: all these\r\nthings were smashed into a thousand pieces. But Coppola threw the\r\nfigure across his shoulder, and, laughing shrilly and horribly, ran\r\nhastily down the stairs, the figure's ugly feet hanging down and\r\nbanging and rattling like wood against the steps. Nathanael was\r\nstupefied;--he had seen only too distinctly that in Olimpia's pallid\r\nwaxed face there were no eyes, merely black holes in their stead; she\r\nwas an inanimate puppet. Spalanzani was rolling on the floor; the\r\npieces of glass had cut his head and breast and arm; the blood was\r\nescaping from him in streams. But he gathered his strength together by\r\nan effort.\r\n\r\n\"After him--after him! What do you stand staring there for?\r\nCoppelius--Coppelius--he's stolen my best automaton--at which I've\r\nworked for twenty years--staked my life upon it--the clock-work--\r\nspeech--movement--mine--your eyes--stolen your eyes--damn him--curse\r\nhim--after him--fetch me back Olimpia--there are the eyes.\" And now\r\nNathanael saw a pair of bloody eyes lying on the floor staring at him;\r\nSpalanzani seized them with his uninjured hand and threw them at him,\r\nso that they hit his breast Then madness dug her burning talons into\r\nhim and swept down into his heart, rending his mind and thoughts to\r\nshreds. \"Aha! aha! aha! Fire-wheel--fire-wheel! Spin round, fire-wheel!\r\nmerrily, merrily! Aha! wooden doll! spin round, pretty wooden doll!\"\r\nand he threw himself upon the Professor, clutching him fast by the\r\nthroat. He would certainly have strangled him had not several people,\r\nattracted by the noise, rushed in and torn away the madman; and so they\r\nsaved the Professor, whose wounds were immediately dressed. Siegmund,\r\nwith all his strength, was not able to subdue the frantic lunatic, who\r\ncontinued to scream in a dreadful way, \"Spin round, wooden doll!\" and\r\nto strike out right and left with his doubled fists. At length the\r\nunited strength of several succeeded in overpowering him by throwing\r\nhim on the floor and binding him. His cries passed into a brutish\r\nbellow that was awful to hear; and thus raging with the harrowing\r\nviolence of madness, he was taken away to the madhouse.\r\n\r\nBefore continuing my narration of what happened further to the\r\nunfortunate Nathanael, I will tell you, indulgent reader, in case you\r\ntake any interest in that skilful mechanician and fabricator of\r\nautomata, Spalanzani, that he recovered completely from his wounds. He\r\nhad, however, to leave the university, for Nathanael's fate had created\r\na great sensation; and the opinion was pretty generally expressed that\r\nit was an imposture altogether unpardonable to have smuggled a wooden\r\npuppet instead of a living person into intelligent tea-circles,--for\r\nOlimpia had been present at several with success. Lawyers called it a\r\ncunning piece of knavery, and all the harder to punish since it was\r\ndirected against the public; and it had been so craftily contrived that\r\nit had escaped unobserved by all except a few preternaturally acute\r\nstudents, although everybody was very wise now and remembered to have\r\nthought of several facts which occurred to them as suspicious. But\r\nthese latter could not succeed in making out any sort of a consistent\r\ntale. For was it, for instance, a thing likely to occur to any one as\r\nsuspicious that, according to the declaration of an elegant beau of\r\nthese tea-parties, Olimpia had, contrary to all good manners, sneezed\r\noftener than she had yawned? The former must have been, in the opinion\r\nof this elegant gentleman, the winding up of the concealed clock-work;\r\nit had always been accompanied by an observable creaking, and so on.\r\nThe Professor of Poetry and Eloquence took a pinch of snuff, and,\r\nslapping the lid to and clearing his throat, said solemnly, \"My most\r\nhonourable ladies and gentlemen, don't you see then where the rub is?\r\nThe whole thing is an allegory, a continuous metaphor. You understand\r\nme? _Sapienti sat._\" But several most honourable gentlemen did not rest\r\nsatisfied with this explanation; the history of this automaton had sunk\r\ndeeply into their souls, and an absurd mistrust of human figures began\r\nto prevail. Several lovers, in order to be fully convinced that they\r\nwere not paying court to a wooden puppet, required that their mistress\r\nshould sing and dance a little out of time, should embroider or knit or\r\nplay with her little pug, &c., when being read to, but above all things\r\nelse that she should do something more than merely listen--that she\r\nshould frequently speak in such a way as to really show that her words\r\npresupposed as a condition some thinking and feeling. The bonds of love\r\nwere in many cases drawn closer in consequence, and so of course became\r\nmore engaging; in other instances they gradually relaxed and fell away.\r\n\"I cannot really be made responsible for it,\" was the remark of more\r\nthan one young gallant. At the tea-gatherings everybody, in order to\r\nward off suspicion, yawned to an incredible extent and never sneezed.\r\nSpalanzani was obliged, as has been said, to leave the place in order\r\nto escape a criminal charge of having fraudulently imposed an automaton\r\nupon human society. Coppola, too, had also disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen Nathanael awoke he felt as if he had been oppressed by a terrible\r\nnightmare; he opened his eyes and experienced an indescribable\r\nsensation of mental comfort, whilst a soft and most beautiful sensation\r\nof warmth pervaded his body. He lay on his own bed in his own room at\r\nhome; Clara was bending over him, and at a little distance stood his\r\nmother and Lothair. \"At last, at last, O my darling Nathanael; now we\r\nhave you again; now you are cured of your grievous illness, now you are\r\nmine again.\" And Clara's words came from the depths of her heart; and\r\nshe clasped him in her arms. The bright scalding tears streamed from\r\nhis eyes, he was so overcome with mingled feelings of sorrow and\r\ndelight; and he gasped forth, \"My Clara, my Clara!\" Siegmund, who had\r\nstaunchly stood by his friend in his hour of need, now came into the\r\nroom. Nathanael gave him his hand--\"My faithful brother, you have not\r\ndeserted me.\" Every trace of insanity had left him, and in the tender\r\nhands of his mother and his beloved, and his friends, he quickly\r\nrecovered his strength again. Good fortune had in the meantime visited\r\nthe house; a niggardly old uncle, from whom they had never expected to\r\nget anything, had died, and left Nathanael's mother not only a\r\nconsiderable fortune, but also a small estate, pleasantly situated not\r\nfar from the town. There they resolved to go and live, Nathanael and\r\nhis mother, and Clara, to whom he was now to be married, and Lothair.\r\nNathanael was become gentler and more childlike than he had ever been\r\nbefore, and now began really to understand Clara's supremely pure and\r\nnoble character. None of them ever reminded him, even in the remotest\r\ndegree, of the past. But when Siegmund took leave of him, he said, \"By\r\nheaven, brother! I was in a bad way, but an angel came just at the\r\nright moment and led me back upon the path of light. Yes, it was\r\nClara.\" Siegmund would not let him speak further, fearing lest the\r\npainful recollections of the past might arise too vividly and too\r\nintensely in his mind.\r\n\r\nThe time came for the four happy people to move to their little\r\nproperty. At noon they were going through the streets. After making\r\nseveral purchases they found that the lofty tower of the town-house was\r\nthrowing its giant shadows across the market-place. \"Come,\" said Clara,\r\n\"let us go up to the top once more and have a look at the distant\r\nhills.\" No sooner said than done. Both of them, Nathanael and Clara,\r\nwent up the tower; their mother, however, went on with the servant-girl\r\nto her new home, and Lothair, not feeling inclined to climb up all the\r\nmany steps, waited below. There the two lovers stood arm-in-arm on the\r\ntopmost gallery of the tower, and gazed out into the sweet-scented\r\nwooded landscape, beyond which the blue hills rose up like a giant's\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! do look at that strange little grey bush, it looks as if it were\r\nactually walking towards us,\" said Clara. Mechanically he put his hand\r\ninto his sidepocket; he found Coppola's perspective and looked for the\r\nbush; Clara stood in front of the glass. Then a convulsive thrill shot\r\nthrough his pulse and veins; pale as a corpse, he fixed his staring\r\neyes upon her; but soon they began to roll, and a fiery current flashed\r\nand sparkled in them, and he yelled fearfully, like a hunted animal.\r\nLeaping up high in the air and laughing horribly at the same time, he\r\nbegan to shout, in a piercing voice, \"Spin round, wooden doll! Spin\r\nround, wooden doll!\" With the strength of a giant he laid hold upon\r\nClara and tried to hurl her over, but in an agony of despair she\r\nclutched fast hold of the railing that went round the gallery. Lothair\r\nheard the madman raging and Clara's scream of terror: a fearful\r\npresentiment flashed across his mind. He ran up the steps; the door of\r\nthe second flight was locked. Clara's scream for help rang out more\r\nloudly. Mad with rage and fear, he threw himself against the door,\r\nwhich at length gave way. Clara's cries were growing fainter and\r\nfainter,--\"Help! save me! save me!\" and her voice died away in the air.\r\n\"She is killed--murdered by that madman,\" shouted Lothair. The door to\r\nthe gallery was also locked. Despair gave him the strength of a giant;\r\nhe burst the door off its hinges. Good God! there was Clara in the\r\ngrasp of the madman Nathanael, hanging over the gallery in the air; she\r\nonly held to the iron bar with one hand. Quick as lightning, Lothair\r\nseized his sister and pulled her back, at the same time dealing the\r\nmadman a blow in the face with his doubled fist, which sent him reeling\r\nbackwards, forcing him to let go his victim.\r\n\r\nLothair ran down with his insensible sister in his arms. She was saved.\r\nBut Nathanael ran round and round the gallery, leaping up in the air\r\nand shouting, \"Spin round, fire-wheel! Spin round, fire-wheel!\" The\r\npeople heard the wild shouting, and a crowd began to gather. In the\r\nmidst of them towered the advocate Coppelius, like a giant; he had only\r\njust arrived in the town, and had gone straight to the market-place.\r\nSome were going up to overpower and take charge of the madman, but\r\nCoppelius laughed and said, \"Ha! ha! wait a bit; he'll come down of his\r\nown accord;\" and he stood gazing upwards along with the rest. All at\r\nonce Nathanael stopped as if spell-bound; he bent down over the\r\nrailing, and perceived Coppelius. With a piercing scream, \"Ha! foine\r\noyes! foine oyes!\" he leapt over.\r\n\r\nWhen Nathanael lay on the stone pavement with a broken head, Coppelius\r\nhad disappeared in the crush and confusion.\r\n\r\nSeveral years afterwards it was reported that, outside the door of a\r\npretty country house in a remote district, Clara had been seen sitting\r\nhand in hand with a pleasant gentleman, whilst two bright boys were\r\nplaying at her feet. From this it may be concluded that she eventually\r\nfound that quiet domestic happiness which her cheerful, blithesome\r\ncharacter required, and which Nathanael, with his tempest-tossed soul,\r\ncould never have been able to give her.\r\n\r\n                      *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO \"THE SAND-MAN\":\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"The Sand-man\" forms the first of a series of tales\r\ncalled \"The Night-pieces,\" and was published in 1817.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Schiller's _Räuber_ Act V., Scene 1.

It is a wild\r\nand desolate neighbourhood, hardly anything more than a single blade of\r\ngrass shooting up here and there from the bottomless drift-sand; and\r\ninstead of the garden that generally ornaments a baronial residence,\r\nthe bare walls are approached on the landward side by a thin forest of\r\nfirs, that with their never-changing vesture of gloom despise the\r\nbright garniture of Spring, and where, instead of the joyous carolling\r\nof little birds awakened anew to gladness, nothing is heard but the\r\nominous croak of the raven and the whirring scream of the storm-boding\r\nsea-gull. A quarter of a mile distant Nature suddenly changes. As if by\r\nthe wave of a magician's wand you are transported into the midst of\r\nthriving fields, fertile arable land, and meadows. You see, too, the\r\nlarge and prosperous village, with the land-steward's spacious\r\ndwelling-house; and at the angle of a pleasant thicket of alders you\r\nmay observe the foundations of a large castle, which one of the former\r\nproprietors had intended to erect. His successors, however, living on\r\ntheir property in Courland, left the building in its unfinished state;\r\nnor would Freiherr[1] Roderick von R---- proceed with the structure\r\nwhen he again took up his residence on the ancestral estate, since the\r\nlonely old castle was more suitable to his temperament, which was\r\nmorose and averse to human society. He had its ruinous walls repaired\r\nas well as circumstances would admit, and then shut himself up\r\nwithin them along with a cross-grained house-steward and a slender\r\nestablishment of servants.\r\n\r\nHe was seldom seen in the village, but on the other hand he often\r\nwalked and rode along the sea-beach; and people claimed to have heard\r\nhim from a distance, talking to the waves and listening to the rolling\r\nand hissing of the surf, as though he could hear the answering voice of\r\nthe spirit of the sea. Upon the topmost summit of the watch-tower he\r\nhad a sort of study fitted up and supplied with telescopes--with a\r\ncomplete set of astronomical apparatus, in fact. Thence during the\r\ndaytime he frequently watched the ships sailing past on the distant\r\nhorizon like white-winged sea-gulls; and there he spent the starlight\r\nnights engaged in astronomical, or, as some professed to know, with\r\nastrological labours, in which the old house-steward assisted him. At\r\nany rate the rumour was current during his own lifetime that he was\r\ndevoted to the occult sciences or the so-called Black Art, and that he\r\nhad been driven out of Courland in consequence of the failure of an\r\nexperiment by which an august princely house had been most seriously\r\noffended. The slightest allusion to his residence in Courland filled\r\nhim with horror; but for all the troubles which had there unhinged the\r\ntenor of his life he held his predecessors entirely to blame, in that\r\nthey had wickedly deserted the home of their ancestors. In order to\r\nfetter, for the future, at least the head of the family to the\r\nancestral castle, he converted it into a property of entail. The\r\nsovereign was the more willing to ratify this arrangement since by its\r\nmeans he would secure for his country a family distinguished for all\r\nchivalrous virtues, and which had already begun to ramify into foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nNeither Roderick's son Hubert, nor the next Roderick, who was so called\r\nafter his grandfather, would live in their ancestral castle; both\r\npreferred Courland. It is conceivable, too, that, being more cheerful\r\nand fond of life than the gloomy astrologer, they were repelled by the\r\ngrim loneliness of the place. Freiherr Roderick had granted shelter and\r\nsubsistence on the property to two old maids, sisters of his father,\r\nwho were living in indigence, having been but niggardly provided for.\r\nThey, together with an aged serving-woman, occupied the small warm\r\nrooms of one of the wings; besides them and the cook, who had a large\r\napartment on the ground floor adjoining the kitchen, the only other\r\nperson was a worn-out _chasseur_, who tottered about through the lofty\r\nrooms and halls of the main building, and discharged the duties of\r\ncastellan. The rest of the servants lived in the village with the\r\nland-steward. The only time at which the desolated and deserted castle\r\nbecame the scene of life and activity was late in autumn, when the snow\r\nfirst began to fall and the season for wolf-hunting and boar-hunting\r\narrived. Then came Freiherr Roderick with his wife, attended by\r\nrelatives and friends and a numerous retinue, from Courland. The\r\nneighbouring nobility, and even amateur lovers of the chase who lived\r\nin the town hard by, came down in such numbers that the main building,\r\ntogether with the wings, barely sufficed to hold the crowd of guests.\r\nWell-served fires roared in all the stoves and fireplaces, while the\r\nspits were creaking from early dawn until late at night, and hundreds\r\nof light-hearted people, masters and servants, were running up and down\r\nstairs; here was heard the jingling and rattling of drinking glasses\r\nand jovial hunting choruses, there the footsteps of those dancing to\r\nthe sound of the shrill music,--everywhere loud mirth and jollity;\r\nso that for four or five weeks together the castle was more like a\r\nfirst-rate hostelry situated on a main highroad than the abode of a\r\ncountry gentleman. This time Freiherr Roderick devoted, as well as he\r\nwas able, to serious business, for, withdrawing from the revelry of his\r\nguests, he discharged the duties attached to his position as lord of\r\nthe entail. He not only had a complete statement of the revenues laid\r\nbefore him, but he listened to every proposal for improvement and to\r\nevery the least complaint of his tenants, endeavouring to establish\r\norder in everything, and check all wrongdoing and injustice as far as\r\nlay in his power.\r\n\r\nIn these matters of business he was honestly assisted by the old\r\nadvocate V----, who had been law agent of the R---- family and\r\nJustitiarius[2] of their estates in P---- from father to son for many\r\nyears; accordingly, V---- was wont to set out for the estate at least a\r\nweek before the day fixed for the arrival of the Freiherr. In the year\r\n179- the time came round again when old V---- was to start on his\r\njourney for R--sitten. However strong and healthy the old man, now\r\nseventy years of age, might feel, he was yet quite assured that a\r\nhelping hand would prove beneficial to him in his business. So he said\r\nto me one day as if in jest, \"Cousin!\" (I was his great-nephew, but he\r\ncalled me \"cousin,\" owing to the fact that his own Christian name and\r\nmine were both the same)--\"Cousin, I was thinking it would not be amiss\r\nif you went along with me to R--sitten and felt the sea-breezes blow\r\nabout your ears a bit. Besides giving me good help in my often\r\nlaborious work, you may for once in a while see how you like the\r\nrollicking life of a hunter, and how, after drawing up a neatly-written\r\nprotocol one morning, you will frame the next when you come to look in\r\nthe glaring eyes of such a sturdy brute as a grim shaggy wolf or a wild\r\nboar gnashing his teeth, and whether you know how to bring him down\r\nwith a well-aimed shot.\" Of course I could not have heard such strange\r\naccounts of the merry hunting parties at R--sitten, or entertain such a\r\ntrue heartfelt affection for my excellent old great-uncle as I did,\r\nwithout being highly delighted that he wanted to take me with him this\r\ntime. As I was already pretty well skilled in the sort of business he\r\nhad to transact, I promised to work with unwearied industry, so as to\r\nrelieve him of all care and trouble.\r\n\r\nNext day we sat in the carriage on our way to R--sitten, well wrapped\r\nup in good fur coats, driving through a thick snowstorm, the first\r\nharbinger of the coming winter. On the journey the old gentleman told\r\nme many remarkable stories about the Freiherr Roderick, who had\r\nestablished the estate-tail and appointed him (V----), in spite of his\r\nyouth, to be his Justitiarius and executor. He spoke of the harsh and\r\nviolent character of the old nobleman, which seemed to be inherited by\r\nall the family, since even the present master of the estate, whom he\r\nhad known as a mild-tempered and almost effeminate youth, acquired more\r\nand more as the years went by the same disposition. He therefore\r\nrecommended me strongly to behave with as much resolute self-reliance\r\nand as little embarrassment as possible, if I desired to possess any\r\nconsideration in the Freiherr's eyes; and at length he began to\r\ndescribe the apartments in the castle which he had selected to be his\r\nown once for all, since they were warm and comfortable, and so\r\nconveniently retired that we could withdraw from the noisy\r\nconvivialities of the hilarious company whenever we pleased. The rooms,\r\nnamely, which were on every visit reserved for him, were two small\r\nones, hung with warm tapestry, close beside the large hall of justice,\r\nin the wing opposite that in which the two old maids resided.\r\n\r\nAt last, after a rapid but wearying journey, we arrived at R--sitten,\r\nlate at night. We drove through the village; it was Sunday, and from\r\nthe alehouse proceeded the sounds of music, and dancing, and\r\nmerrymaking; the steward's house was lit up from basement to garret,\r\nand music and song were there too. All the more striking therefore was\r\nthe inhospitable desolation into which we now drove. The sea-wind\r\nhowled in sharp cutting dirges as it were about us, whilst the sombre\r\nfirs, as if they had been roused by the wind from a deep magic trance,\r\ngroaned hoarsely in a responsive chorus. The bare black walls of the\r\ncastle towered above the snow-covered ground; we drew up at the gates,\r\nwhich were fast locked. But no shouting or cracking of whips, no\r\nknocking or hammering, was of any avail; the whole castle seemed to be\r\ndead; not a single light was visible at any of the windows. The old\r\ngentleman shouted in his strong stentorian voice, \"Francis, Francis,\r\nwhere the deuce are you? In the devil's name rouse yourself; we are all\r\nfreezing here outside the gates. The snow is cutting our faces till\r\nthey bleed. Why the devil don't you stir yourself?\" Then the watch-dog\r\nbegan to whine, and a wandering light was visible on the ground floor.\r\nThere was a rattling of keys, and soon the ponderous wings of the gate\r\ncreaked back on their hinges. \"Ha! a hearty welcome, a hearty welcome,\r\nHerr Justitiarius. Ugh! it's rough weather!\" cried old Francis, holding\r\nthe lantern above his head, so that the light fell full upon his\r\nwithered face, which was drawn up into a curious grimace, that was\r\nmeant for a friendly smile. The carriage drove into the court, and we\r\ngot out; then I obtained a full view of the old servant's extraordinary\r\nfigure, almost hidden in his wide old-fashioned chasseur livery, with\r\nits many extraordinary lace decorations. Whilst there were only a few\r\ngrey locks on his broad white forehead, the lower part of his face wore\r\nthe ruddy hue of health; and, notwithstanding that the cramped muscles\r\nof his face gave it something of the appearance of a whimsical mask,\r\nyet the rather stupid good-nature which beamed from his eyes and played\r\nabout his mouth compensated for all the rest.\r\n\r\n\"Now, old Francis,\" began my great-uncle, knocking the snow from his\r\nfur coat in the entrance hall, \"now, old man, is everything prepared?\r\nHave you had the hangings in my room well dusted, and the beds carried\r\nin? and have you had a big roaring fire both yesterday and to-day?\"\r\n\"No,\" replied Francis, quite calmly, \"no, my worshipful Herr\r\nJustitiarius, we've got none of that done.\" \"Good Heavens!\" burst out\r\nmy great-uncle, \"I wrote to you in proper time; you know that I always\r\ncome at the time I fix. Here's a fine piece of stupid carelessness! I\r\nshall have to sleep in rooms as cold as ice.\" \"But you see, worshipful\r\nHerr Justitiarius,\" continued Francis, most carefully clipping a\r\nburning thief from the wick of the candle with the snuffers and\r\nstamping it out with his foot, \"but, you see, sir, all that would not\r\nhave been of much good, especially the fires, for the wind and the snow\r\nhave taken up their quarters too much in the rooms, driving in through\r\nthe broken windows, and then\"---- \"What!\" cried my uncle, interrupting\r\nhim as he spread out his fur coat and placing his arms akimbo, \"do you\r\nmean to tell me the windows are broken, and you, the castellan of the\r\nhouse, have done nothing to get them mended?\" \"But, worshipful Herr\r\nJustitiarius,\" resumed the old servant calmly and composedly, \"but we\r\ncan't very well get at them owing to the great masses of stones and\r\nrubbish lying all over the room.\" \"Damn it all, how come there to be\r\nstones and rubbish in my room?\" cried my uncle. \"Your lasting health\r\nand good luck, young gentleman!\" said the old man, bowing politely to\r\nme, as I happened to sneeze;[3] but he immediately added, \"They are the\r\nstones and plaster of the partition wall which fell in at the great\r\nshock.\" \"Have you had an earthquake?\" blazed up my uncle, now fairly in\r\na rage. \"No, not an earthquake, worshipful Herr Justitiarius,\" replied\r\nthe old man, grinning all over his face, \"but three days ago the heavy\r\nwainscot ceiling of the justice-hall fell in with a tremendous crash.\"\r\n\"Then may the\"---- My uncle was about to rip out a terrific oath in his\r\nviolent passionate manner, but jerking up his right arm above his head\r\nand taking off his fox-skin cap with his left, he suddenly checked\r\nhimself; and turning to me, he said with a hearty laugh, \"By my troth,\r\ncousin, we must hold our tongues; we mustn't ask any more questions, or\r\nelse we shall hear of some still worse misfortune, or have the whole\r\ncastle tumbling to pieces about our ears.\" \"But,\" he continued,\r\nwheeling round again to the old servant, \"but, bless me, Francis, could\r\nyou not have had the common sense to get me another room cleaned and\r\nwarmed? Could you not have quickly fitted up a room in the main\r\nbuilding for the court-day?\" \"All that has been already done,\" said the\r\nold man, pointing to the staircase with a gesture that invited us to\r\nfollow him, and at once beginning to ascend them. \"Now there's a most\r\ncurious noodle for you!\" exclaimed my uncle as we followed old Francis.\r\nThe way led through long lofty vaulted corridors, in the dense darkness\r\nof which Francis's flickering light threw a strange reflection. The\r\npillars, capitals, and vari-coloured arches seemed as if they were\r\nfloating before us in the air; our own shadows stalked along beside us\r\nin gigantic shape, and the grotesque paintings on the walls over which\r\nthey glided seemed all of a tremble and shake; whilst their voices, we\r\ncould imagine, were whispering in the sound of our echoing footsteps,\r\n\"Wake us not, oh! wake us not--us whimsical spirits who sleep here in\r\nthese old stones.\" At last, after we had traversed a long suite of cold\r\nand gloomy apartments, Francis opened the door of a hall in which a\r\nfire blazing brightly in the grate offered us as it were a home-like\r\nwelcome with its pleasant crackling. I felt quite comfortable the\r\nmoment I entered, but my uncle, standing still in the middle of the\r\nhall, looked round him and said in a tone which was so very grave as to\r\nbe almost solemn, \"And so this is to be the justice-hall!\" Francis held\r\nhis candle above his head, so that my eye fell upon a light spot in the\r\nwide dark wall about the size of a door; then he said in a pained and\r\nmuffled voice, \"Justice has been already dealt out here.\" \"What\r\npossesses you, old man?\" asked my uncle, quickly throwing aside his fur\r\ncoat and drawing near to the fire. \"It slipped over my lips, I couldn't\r\nhelp it,\" said Francis; then he lit the great candles and opened the\r\ndoor of the adjoining room, which was very snugly fitted up for our\r\nreception. In a short time a table was spread for us before the fire,\r\nand the old man served us with several well-dressed dishes, which\r\nwere followed by a brimming bowl of punch, prepared in true Northern\r\nstyle,--a very acceptable sight to two weary travellers like my uncle\r\nand myself. My uncle then, tired with his journey, went to bed as soon\r\nas he had finished supper; but my spirits were too much excited by the\r\nnovelty and strangeness of the place, as well as by the punch, for me\r\nto think of sleep. Meanwhile, Francis cleared the table, stirred up the\r\nfire, and bowing and scraping politely, left me to myself.\r\n\r\nNow I sat alone in the lofty spacious _Rittersaal_ or Knight's Hall.\r\nThe snow-flakes had ceased to beat against the lattice, and the storm\r\nhad ceased to whistle; the sky was clear, and the bright full moon\r\nshone in through the wide oriel-windows, illuminating with magical\r\neffect all the dark corners of the curious room into which the dim\r\nlight of my candles and the fire could not penetrate. As one often\r\nfinds in old castles, the walls and ceiling of the hall were ornamented\r\nin a peculiar antique fashion, the former with fantastic paintings and\r\ncarvings, gilded and coloured in gorgeous tints, the latter with heavy\r\nwainscoting. Standing out conspicuously from the great pictures, which\r\nrepresented for the most part wild bloody scenes in bear-hunts and\r\nwolf-hunts, were the heads of men and animals carved in wood and joined\r\non to the painted bodies, so that the whole, especially in the\r\nflickering light of the fire and the soft beams of the moon, had an\r\neffect as if all were alive and instinct with terrible reality. Between\r\nthese pictures reliefs of knights had been inserted, of life size,\r\nwalking along in hunting costume; probably they were the ancestors of\r\nthe family who had delighted in the chase. Everything, both in the\r\npaintings and in the carved work, bore the dingy hue of extreme old\r\nage; so much the more conspicuous therefore was the bright bare place\r\non that one of the walls through which were two doors leading into\r\nadjoining apartments. I soon concluded that there too there must have\r\nbeen a door, that had been bricked up later; and hence it was that this\r\nnew part of the wall, which had neither been painted like the rest, nor\r\nyet ornamented with carvings, formed such a striking contrast with the\r\nothers. Who does not know with what mysterious power the mind is\r\nenthralled in the midst of unusual and singularly strange\r\ncircumstances? Even the dullest imagination is aroused when it comes\r\ninto a valley girt around by fantastic rocks, or within the gloomy\r\nwalls of a church or an abbey, and it begins to have glimpses of things\r\nit has never yet experienced. When I add that I was twenty years of\r\nage, and had drunk several glasses of strong punch, it will easily be\r\nconceived that as I sat thus in the _Rittersaal_ I was in a more\r\nexceptional frame of mind than I had ever been before. Let the reader\r\npicture to himself the stillness of the night within, and without the\r\nrumbling roar of the sea--the peculiar piping of the wind, which rang\r\nupon my ears like the tones of a mighty organ played upon by spectral\r\nhands--the passing scudding clouds which, shining bright and white,\r\noften seemed to peep in through the rattling oriel-windows like giants\r\nsailings past--in very truth, I felt, from the slight shudder which\r\nshook me, that possibly a new sphere of existences might now be\r\nrevealed to me visibly and perceptibly. But this feeling was like the\r\nshivery sensations that one has on hearing a graphically narrated ghost\r\nstory, such as we all like. At this moment it occurred to me that I\r\nshould never be in a more seasonable mood for reading the book which,\r\nin common with every one who had the least leaning towards the\r\nromantic, I at that time carried about in my pocket,--I mean Schiller's\r\n\"Ghost-seer.\" I read and read, and my imagination grew ever more and\r\nmore excited. I came to the marvellously enthralling description of the\r\nwedding feast at Count Von V----'s.\r\n\r\nJust as I was reading of the entrance of Jeronimo's bloody figure,[4]\r\nthe door leading from the gallery into the antechamber flew open with a\r\ntremendous bang. I started to my feet in terror; the book fell from my\r\nhands. In the very same moment, however, all was still again, and I\r\nbegan to be ashamed of my childish fears. The door must have been burst\r\nopen by a strong gust of wind or in some other natural manner. It is\r\nnothing; my over-strained fancy converts every ordinary occurrence into\r\nthe supernatural. Having thus calmed my fears, I picked up my book from\r\nthe ground, and again threw myself in the arm-chair; but there came a\r\nsound of soft, slow, measured footsteps moving diagonally across the\r\nhall, whilst there was a sighing and moaning at intervals, and in this\r\nsighing and moaning there was expressed the deepest trouble, the most\r\nhopeless grief, that a human being can know. \"Ha! it must be some sick\r\nanimal locked up somewhere in the basement storey. Such acoustic\r\ndeceptions at night time, making distant sounds appear close at hand,\r\nare well known to everybody. Who will suffer himself to be terrified at\r\nsuch a thing as that?\" Thus I calmed my fears again. But now there was\r\na scratching at the new portion of the wall, whilst louder and deeper\r\nsighs were audible, as if gasped out by some one in the last throes of\r\nmortal anguish. \"Yes, yes; it is some poor animal locked up somewhere;\r\nI will shout as loudly as I can, I will stamp violently on the floor,\r\nthen all will be still, or else the animal below will make itself heard\r\nmore distinctly, and in its natural cries,\" I thought. But the blood\r\nran cold in my veins; the cold sweat, too, stood upon my forehead, and\r\nI remained sitting in my chair as if transfixed, quite unable to rise,\r\nstill less to cry out. At length the abominable scratching ceased, and\r\nI again heard the footsteps. Life and motion seemed to be awakened in\r\nme; I leapt to my feet, and went two or three steps forward. But then\r\nthere came an ice-cold draught of wind through the hall, whilst at the\r\nsame moment the moon cast her bright light upon the statue of a grave\r\nif not almost terrible-looking man; and then, as though his warning\r\nvoice rang through the louder thunders of the waves and the shriller\r\npiping of the wind, I heard distinctly, \"No further, no further! or you\r\nwill sink beneath all the fearful horrors of the world of spectres.\"\r\nThen the door was slammed too with the same violent bang as before, and\r\nI plainly heard the footsteps in the anteroom, then going down the\r\nstairs. The main door of the castle was opened with a creaking noise,\r\nand afterwards closed again. Then it seemed as if a horse were brought\r\nout of the stable, and after a while taken back again, and finally all\r\nwas still.\r\n\r\nAt that same moment my attention was attracted to my old uncle in the\r\nadjoining room; he was groaning and moaning painfully. This brought me\r\nfully to consciousness again; I seized the candles and hurried into the\r\nroom to him. He appeared to be struggling with an ugly, unpleasant\r\ndream. \"Wake up, wake up!\" I cried loudly, taking him gently by the\r\nhand, and letting the full glare of the light fall upon his face. He\r\nstarted up with a stifled shout, and then, looking kindly at me, said,\r\n\"Ay, you have done quite right--that you have, cousin, to wake me. I\r\nhave had a very ugly dream, and it's all solely owing to this room and\r\nthat hall, for they made me think of past times and many wonderful\r\nthings that have happened here. But now let us turn to and have a\r\ngood sound sleep.\" Therewith the old gentleman rolled himself in the\r\nbed-covering and appeared to fall asleep at once. But when I had\r\nextinguished the candles and likewise crept into bed, I heard him\r\npraying in a low tone to himself.\r\n\r\nNext morning we began work in earnest; the land-steward brought his\r\naccount-books, and various other people came, some to get a dispute\r\nsettled, some to get arrangements made about other matters. At noon my\r\nuncle took me with him to the wing where the two old Baronesses lived,\r\nthat we might pay our respects to them with all due form. Francis\r\nhaving announced us, we had to wait some time before a little old dame,\r\nbent with the weight of her sixty years, and attired in gay-coloured\r\nsilks, who styled herself the noble ladies' lady-in-waiting, appeared\r\nand led us into the sanctuary. There we were received with comical\r\nceremony by the old ladies, whose curious style of dress had gone out\r\nof fashion years and years before. I especially was an object of\r\nastonishment to them when my uncle, with considerable humour,\r\nintroduced me as a young lawyer who had come to assist him in his\r\nbusiness. Their countenances plainly indicated their belief that, owing\r\nto my youth, the welfare of the tenants of R--sitten was placed in\r\njeopardy. Although there was a good deal that was truly ridiculous\r\nduring the whole of this interview with the old ladies, I was\r\nnevertheless still shivering from the terror of the preceding night; I\r\nfelt as if I had come in contact with an unknown power, or rather as if\r\nI had grazed against the outer edge of a circle, one step across which\r\nwould be enough to plunge me irretrievably into destruction, as though\r\nit were only by the exertion of all the power of my will that I should\r\nbe able to guard myself against _that_ awful dread which never slackens\r\nits hold upon you until it ends in incurable insanity. Hence it was\r\nthat the old Baronesses, with their remarkable towering head-dresses,\r\nand their peculiar stuff gowns, tricked off with gay flowers and\r\nribbons, instead of striking me as merely ridiculous, had an appearance\r\nthat was both ghostly and awe-inspiring. My fancy seemed to glean from\r\ntheir yellow withered faces and blinking eyes, ocular proof of the fact\r\nthat they had succeeded in establishing themselves on at least a good\r\nfooting with the ghosts who haunted the castle, as it derived auricular\r\nconfirmation of the same fact from the wretched French which they\r\ncroaked, partly between their tightly-closed blue lips and partly\r\nthrough their long thin noses, and also that they themselves possessed\r\nthe power of setting trouble and dire mischief at work. My uncle, who\r\nalways had a keen eye for a bit of fun, entangled the old dames in his\r\nironical way in such a mish-mash of nonsensical rubbish that, had I\r\nbeen in any other mood, I should not have known how to swallow down my\r\nimmoderate laughter; but, as I have just said, the Baronesses and their\r\ntwaddle were, and continued to be, in my regard, ghostly, so that my\r\nold uncle, who was aiming at affording me an especial diversion,\r\nglanced across at me time after time utterly astonished. So after\r\ndinner, when we were alone together in our room, he burst out, \"But in\r\nHeaven's name, cousin, tell me what is the matter with you? You don't\r\nlaugh; you don't talk; you don't eat; and you don't drink. Are you ill,\r\nor is anything else the matter with you?\" I now hesitated not a moment\r\nto tell him circumstantially all my terrible, awful experiences of the\r\nprevious night I did not conceal anything, and above all I did not\r\nconceal that I had drunk a good deal of punch, and had been reading\r\nSchiller's \"Ghostseer.\" \"This I must confess to,\" I add, \"for only so\r\ncan I credibly explain how it was that my over-strained and active\r\nimagination could create all those ghostly spirits, which only exist\r\nwithin the sphere of my own brain.\" I fully expected that my uncle\r\nwould now pepper me well with the stinging pellets of his wit for this\r\nmy fanciful ghost-seeing; but, on the contrary, he grew very grave, and\r\nhis eyes became riveted in a set stare upon the floor, until he jerked\r\nup his head and said, fixing me with his keen fiery eyes, \"Your book I\r\nam not acquainted with, cousin; but your ghostly visitants were due\r\nneither to it nor to the fumes of the punch. I must tell you that I\r\ndreamt exactly the same things that you saw and heard. Like you, I sat\r\nin the easy-chair beside the fire (at least I dreamt so); but what was\r\nonly revealed to you as slight noises I saw and distinctly comprehended\r\nwith the eye of my mind. Yes, I beheld that foul fiend come in,\r\nstealthily and feebly step across to the bricked-up door, and scratch\r\nat the wall in hopeless despair until the blood gushed out from beneath\r\nhis torn finger-nails; then he went downstairs, took a horse out of the\r\nstable, and finally put him back again. Did you also hear the cock\r\ncrowing in a distant farmyard up at the village? You came and awoke me,\r\nand I soon resisted the baneful ghost of that terrible man, who is\r\nstill able to disturb in this fearful way the quiet lives of the\r\nliving.\" The old gentleman stopped; and I did not like to ask him\r\nfurther questions, being well aware that he would explain everything to\r\nme when he deemed that the proper time was come for doing so. After\r\nsitting for a while, deeply absorbed in his own thoughts, he went on,\r\n\"Cousin, do you think you have courage enough to encounter the ghost\r\nagain now that you know all that happens,--that is to say, along with\r\nme?\" Of course I declared that I now felt quite strong enough, and\r\nready for what he wished. \"Then let us watch together during the coming\r\nnight,\" the old gentleman went on to say. \"There is a voice within me\r\ntelling me that this evil spirit must fly, not so much before the power\r\nof my will as before my courage, which rests upon a basis of firm\r\nconviction. I feel that it is not at all presumption in me, but rather\r\na good and pious deed, if I venture life and limb to exorcise this foul\r\nfiend that is banishing the sons from the old castle of their\r\nancestors. But what am I thinking about? There can be no risk in the\r\ncase at all, for with such a firm, honest mind and pious trust that I\r\nfeel I possess, I and everybody cannot fail to be, now and always,\r\nvictorious over such ghostly antagonists. And yet if, after all, it\r\nshould be God's will that this evil power be enabled to work me\r\nmischief, then you must bear witness, cousin, that I fell in honest\r\nChristian fight against the spirit of hell which was here busy about\r\nits fiendish work. As for yourself, keep at a distance; no harm will\r\nhappen to you then.\"\r\n\r\nOur attention was busily engaged with divers kinds of business until\r\nevening came. As on the day before, Francis had cleared away the\r\nremains of the supper, and brought us our punch. The full moon shone\r\nbrightly through the gleaming clouds, the sea-waves roared, and the\r\nnight-wind howled and shook the oriel window till the panes rattled.\r\nAlthough inwardly excited, we forced ourselves to converse on\r\nindifferent topics. The old gentleman had placed his striking watch on\r\nthe table; it struck twelve. Then the door flew open with a terrific\r\nbang, and, just as on the preceding night, soft slow footsteps moved\r\nstealthily across the hall in a diagonal direction, whilst there were\r\nthe same sounds of sighing and moaning. My uncle turned pale, but his\r\neyes shone with an unusual brilliance. He rose from his arm-chair,\r\nstretching his tall figure up to its full height, so that as he stood\r\nthere with his left arm propped against his side and with his right\r\nstretched out towards the middle of the hall, he had the appearance of\r\na hero issuing his commands. But the sighing and moaning were growing\r\nevery moment louder and more perceptible, and then the scratching at\r\nthe wall began more horribly even than on the previous night. My uncle\r\nstrode forwards straight towards the walled-up door, and his steps were\r\nso firm that they echoed along the floor. He stopped immediately in\r\nfront of the place, where the scratching noise continued to grow worse\r\nand worse, and said in a strong solemn voice, such as I had never\r\nbefore heard from his lips, \"Daniel, Daniel! what are you doing here at\r\nthis hour?\" Then there was a horrible unearthly scream, followed by a\r\ndull thud as if a heavy weight had fallen to the ground. \"Seek for\r\npardon and mercy at the throne of the Almighty; that is your place.\r\nAway with you from the scenes of this life, in which you can nevermore\r\nhave part.\" And as the old gentleman uttered these words in a tone\r\nstill stronger than before, a feeble wail seemed to pass through the\r\nair and die away in the blustering of the storm, which was just\r\nbeginning to rage. Crossing over to the door, the old gentleman slammed\r\nit to, so that the echo rang loudly through the empty anteroom. There\r\nwas something so supernatural almost in both his language and his\r\ngestures that I was deeply struck with awe. On resuming his seat in his\r\narm-chair his face was as if transfigured; he folded his hands and\r\nprayed inwardly. In this way several minutes passed, when he asked me\r\nin that gentle tone which always went right to my heart, and which he\r\nalways had so completely at his command, \"Well, cousin?\" Agitated and\r\nshaken by awe, terror, fear, and pious respect and love, I threw myself\r\nupon my knees and rained down my warm tears upon the hand he offered\r\nme. He clasped me in his arms, and pressing me fervently to his heart\r\nsaid very tenderly, \"Now we will go and have a good quiet sleep, good\r\ncousin;\" and we did so. And as nothing of an unusual nature occurred on\r\nthe following night, we soon recovered our former cheerfulness, to the\r\nprejudice of the old Baronesses; for though there did still continue to\r\nbe something ghostly about them and their odd manners, yet it emanated\r\nfrom a diverting ghost which the old gentleman knew how to call up in a\r\ndroll fashion.\r\n\r\nAt length, after the lapse of several days, the Baron put in his\r\nappearance, along with his wife and a numerous train of servants for\r\nthe hunting; the guests who had been invited also arrived, and the\r\ncastle, now suddenly awakened to animation, became the scene of the\r\nnoisy life and revelry which have been before described. When the Baron\r\ncame into our hall soon after his arrival, he seemed to be disagreeably\r\nsurprised at the change in our quarters. Casting an ill-tempered glance\r\ntowards the bricked-up door, he turned abruptly round and passed his\r\nhand across his forehead, as if desirous of banishing some disagreeable\r\nrecollection. My great-uncle mentioned the damage done to the\r\njustice-hall and the adjoining apartments; but the Baron found fault\r\nwith Francis for not accommodating us with better lodgings, and he\r\ngood-naturedly requested the old gentleman to order anything he might\r\nwant to make his new room comfortable; for it was much less\r\nsatisfactory in this respect than that which he had usually occupied.\r\nOn the whole, the Baron's bearing towards my old uncle was not merely\r\ncordial, but largely coloured by a certain deferential respect, as if\r\nthe relation in which he stood towards him was that of a younger\r\nrelative. But this was the sole trait that could in any way reconcile\r\nme to his harsh, imperious character, which was now developed more and\r\nmore every day. As for me, he seemed to notice me but little; if he did\r\nnotice me at all, he saw in me nothing more than the usual secretary or\r\nclerk. On the occasion of the very first important memorandum that I\r\ndrew up, he began to point out mistakes, as he conceived, in the\r\nwording. My blood boiled, and I was about to make a caustic reply, when\r\nmy uncle interposed, informing him briefly that I did my work exactly\r\nin the way he wished, and that in legal matters of this kind he alone\r\nwas responsible. When we were left alone, I complained bitterly of the\r\nBaron, who would, I said, always inspire me with growing aversion. \"I\r\nassure you, cousin,\" replied the old gentleman, \"that the Baron,\r\nnotwithstanding his unpleasant manner, is really one of the most\r\nexcellent and kind-hearted men in the world. As I have already told\r\nyou, he did not assume these manners until the time he became lord of\r\nthe entail; previous to then he was a modest, gentle youth. Besides, he\r\nis not, after all, so bad as you make him out to be; and further, I\r\nshould like to know why you are so averse to him.\" As my uncle said\r\nthese words he smiled mockingly, and the blood rushed hotly and\r\nfuriously into my face. I could not pretend to hide from myself--I saw\r\nit only too clearly, and felt it too unmistakably--that my peculiar\r\nantipathy to the Baron sprang out of the fact that I loved, even to\r\nmadness, a being who appeared to me to be the loveliest and most\r\nfascinating of her sex who had ever trod the earth. This lady was none\r\nother than the Baroness herself. Her appearance exercised a powerful\r\nand irresistible charm upon me at the very moment of her arrival, when\r\nI saw her traversing the apartments in her Russian sable cloak, which\r\nfitted close to the exquisite symmetry of her shape, and with a rich\r\nveil wrapped about her head. Moreover, the circumstance that the\r\ntwo old aunts, with still more extraordinary gowns and be-ribboned\r\nhead-dresses than I had yet seen them wear, were sweeping along one on\r\neach side of her and cackling their welcomes in French, whilst the\r\nBaroness was looking about her in a way so gentle as to baffle all\r\ndescription, nodding graciously first to one and then to another, and\r\nthen adding in her flute-like voice a few German words in the pure\r\nsonorous dialect of Courland--all this formed a truly remarkable and\r\nunusual picture, and my imagination involuntarily connected it with the\r\nghostly midnight visitant,--the Baroness being the angel of light who\r\nwas to break the ban of the spectral powers of evil. This wondrously\r\nlovely lady stood forth in startling reality before my mind's eye. At\r\nthat time she could hardly be nineteen years of age, and her face, as\r\ndelicately beautiful as her form, bore the impression of the most\r\nangelic good-nature; but what I especially noticed was the\r\nindescribable fascination of her dark eyes, for a soft melancholy gleam\r\nof aspiration shone in them like dewy moonshine, whilst a perfect\r\nelysium of rapture and delight was revealed in her sweet and beautiful\r\nsmile. She often seemed completely lost in her own thoughts, and at\r\nsuch moments her lovely face was swept by dark and fleeting shadows.\r\nMany observers would have concluded that she was affected by some\r\ndistressing pain; but it rather seemed to me that she was struggling\r\nwith gloomy apprehensions of a future pregnant with dark misfortunes;\r\nand with these, strangely enough, I connected the apparition of the\r\ncastle, though I could not give the least explanation of why I did so.\r\n\r\nOn the morning following the Baron's arrival, when the company\r\nassembled to breakfast, my old uncle introduced me to the Baroness;\r\nand, as usually happens with people in the frame of mind in which I\r\nthen was, I behaved with indescribable absurdity. In answer to the\r\nbeautiful lady's simple inquiries how I liked the castle, &c., I\r\nentangled myself in the most extraordinary and nonsensical phrases, so\r\nthat the old aunts ascribed my embarrassment simply and solely to my\r\nprofound respect for the noble lady, and thought they were called\r\nupon condescendingly to take my part, which they did by praising\r\nme in French as a very nice and clever young man, as a _garçon très\r\njoli_ (handsome lad). This vexed me; so suddenly recovering my\r\nself-possession, I threw out a _bonmot_ in better French than the old\r\ndames were mistresses of; whereupon they opened their eyes wide in\r\nastonishment, and pampered their long thin noses with a liberal supply\r\nof snuff. From the Baroness's turning from me with a more serious air\r\nto talk to some other lady, I perceived that my _bonmot_ bordered\r\nclosely upon folly; this vexed me still more, and I wished the two old\r\nladies to the devil. My old uncle's irony had long before brought me\r\nthrough the stage of the languishing love-sick swain, who in childish\r\ninfatuation coddles his love-troubles; but I knew very well that the\r\nBaroness had made a deeper and more powerful impression upon my heart\r\nthan any other woman had hitherto done. I saw and heard nothing but\r\nher; nevertheless I had a most explicit and unequivocal consciousness\r\nthat it would be not only absurd, but even utter madness to dream of an\r\namour, albeit I perceived no less clearly the impossibility of gazing\r\nand adoring at a distance like a love-lorn boy. Of such conduct I\r\nshould have been perfectly ashamed. But what I could do, and what I\r\nresolved to do, was to become more intimate with this beautiful girl\r\nwithout allowing her to get any glimpse of my real feelings, to drink\r\nthe sweet poison of her looks and words, and then, when far away from\r\nher, to bear her image in my heart for many, many days, perhaps for\r\never. I was excited by this romantic and chivalric attachment to such a\r\ndegree, that, as I pondered over it during sleepless nights, I was\r\nchildish enough to address myself in pathetic monologues, and even to\r\nsigh lugubriously, \"Seraphina! O Seraphina!\" till at last my old uncle\r\nwoke up and cried, \"Cousin, cousin! I believe you are dreaming aloud.\r\nDo it by daytime, if you can possibly contrive it, but at night have\r\nthe goodness to let me sleep.\" I was very much afraid that the old\r\ngentleman, who had not failed to remark my excitement on the Baroness's\r\narrival, had heard the name, and would overwhelm me with his sarcastic\r\nwit. But next morning all he said, as we went into the justice-hall,\r\nwas, \"God grant every man the proper amount of common sense, and\r\nsufficient watchfulness to keep it well under hand. It's a bad look-out\r\nwhen a man becomes converted into a fantastic coxcomb without so much\r\nas a word of warning.\" Then he took his seat at the great table and\r\nadded, \"Write neatly and distinctly, good cousin, that I may be able to\r\nread it without any trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThe respect, nay, the almost filial veneration which the Baron\r\nentertained towards my uncle, was manifested on all occasions.\r\nThus, at the dinner-table he had to occupy the seat--which many envied\r\nhim--beside the Baroness; as for me, chance threw me first in one place\r\nand then in another; but for the most part, two or three officers from\r\nthe neighbouring capital were wont to attach me to them, in order that\r\nthey might empty to their own satisfaction their budget of news and\r\namusing anecdotes, whilst diligently passing the wine about. Thus it\r\nhappened that for several days in succession I sat at the bottom of the\r\ntable at a great distance from the Baroness. At length, however, chance\r\nbrought me nearer to her. Just as the doors of the dining-hall were\r\nthrown open for the assembled company, I happened to be in the midst of\r\na conversation with the Baroness's companion and confidante,--a lady no\r\nlonger in the bloom of youth, but by no means ill-looking, and not\r\nwithout intelligence,--and she seemed to take some interest in my\r\nremarks. According to etiquette, it was my duty to offer her my arm,\r\nand I was not a little pleased when she took her place quite close to\r\nthe Baroness, who gave her a friendly nod. It may be readily imagined\r\nthat all that I now said was intended not only for my fair neighbour,\r\nbut also mainly for the Baroness. Whether it was that the inward\r\ntension of my feelings imparted an especial animation to all I said, at\r\nany rate my companion's attention became more riveted with every\r\nsucceeding moment; in fact, she was at last entirely absorbed in the\r\nvisions of the kaleidoscopic world which I unfolded to her gaze. As\r\nremarked, she was not without intelligence, and it soon came to pass\r\nthat our conversation, completely independent of the multitude of words\r\nspoken by the other guests (which rambled about first to this subject\r\nand then to that), maintained its own free course, launching an\r\neffective word now and again whither I wanted it. For I did not fail to\r\nobserve that my companion shot a significant glance or two across to\r\nthe Baroness, and that the latter took pains to listen to us. And this\r\nwas particularly the case when the conversation turned upon music and I\r\nbegan to speak with enthusiasm of this glorious and sacred art; nor did\r\nI conceal that, despite the fact of my having devoted myself to the dry\r\ntedious study of the law, I possessed tolerable skill on the\r\nharpsichord, could sing, and had even set several songs to music.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the company had gone into another room to take coffee\r\nand liqueurs; but, unawares, without knowing how it came about, I found\r\nmyself near the Baroness, who was talking with her confidante. She at\r\nonce addressed me, repeating in a still more cordial manner and in the\r\ntone in which one talks to an acquaintance, her inquiries as to how I\r\nliked living in the castle, &c. I assured her that for the first few\r\ndays, not only the dreary desolation of the situation, but the ancient\r\ncastle itself had affected me strangely, but even in this mood I had\r\nfound much of deep interest, and that now my only wish was to be\r\nexcused from the stirring scenes of the hunt, for I had not been\r\naccustomed to them. The Baroness smiled and said, \"I can readily\r\nbelieve that this wild life in our fir forests cannot be very congenial\r\nto you. You are a musician, and, unless I am utterly mistaken, a poet\r\nas well. I am passionately fond of both arts. I can also play the harp\r\na little, but I have to do without it here in R--sitten, for my husband\r\ndoes not like me to bring it with me. Its soft strains would harmonize\r\nbut ill with the wild shouts of the hunters and the ringing blare of\r\ntheir bugles, which are the only sounds that ought to be heard here.\r\nAnd O heaven! how I should like to hear a little music!\" I protested\r\nthat I would exert all the skill I had at my command to fulfil her\r\nwish, for there must surely without doubt be an instrument of some kind\r\nin the castle, even though it were only an old harpsichord. Then the\r\nLady Adelheid (the Baroness's confidante) burst out into a silvery\r\nlaugh and asked, did I not know that within the memory of man no other\r\ninstrument had ever been heard in the castle except cracked trumpets,\r\nand hunting-horns which in the midst of joy would only sound lugubrious\r\nnotes, and the twanging fiddles, untuned violoncellos, and braying\r\noboes of itinerant musicians. The Baroness reiterated her wish that she\r\nshould like to have some music, and especially should like to hear me;\r\nand both she and Adelheid racked their brains all to no purpose to\r\ndevise some scheme by which they could get a decent pianoforte brought\r\nto the Castle. At this moment old Francis crossed the room. \"Here's the\r\nman who always can give the best advice, and can procure everything,\r\neven things before unheard of and unseen.\" With these words the Lady\r\nAdelheid called him to her, and as she endeavoured to make him\r\ncomprehend what it was that was wanted, the Baroness listened with her\r\nhands clasped and her head bent forward, looking upon the old man's\r\nface with a gentle smile. She made a most attractive picture, like some\r\nlovely, winsome child that is all eagerness to have a wished-for toy in\r\nits hands. Francis, after having adduced in his prolix manner several\r\nreasons why it would be downright impossible to procure such a\r\nwonderful instrument in such a big hurry, finally stroked his beard\r\nwith an air of self-flattery and said, \"But the land-steward's lady up\r\nat the village performs on the manichord, or whatever is the outlandish\r\nname they now call it, with uncommon skill, and sings to it so fine and\r\nmournful-like that it makes your eyes red, just like onions do, and\r\nmakes you feel as if you would like to dance with both legs at once.\"\r\n\"And you say she has a pianoforte?\" interposed Lady Adelheid. \"Aye,\r\nto be sure,\" continued the old man; \"it comed straight from Dresden;\r\na\"--(\"Oh, that's fine!\" interrupted the Baroness)--\"a beautiful\r\ninstrument,\" went on the old man, \"but a little weakly; for not long\r\nago, when the organist began to play on it the hymn 'In all Thy\r\nworks,'[5] he broke it all to pieces, so that\"--(\"Good gracious!\"\r\nexclaimed both the Baroness and Lady Adelheid)--\"so that,\" went on the\r\nold man again, \"it had to be taken to R---- to be mended, and cost a\r\nlot of money.\" \"But has it come back again?\" asked Lady Adelheid\r\nimpatiently. \"Aye, to be sure, my lady, and the steward's lady will\r\nreckon it a high honour----\" At this moment the Baron chanced to pass.\r\nHe looked across at our group rather astonished, and whispered with a\r\nsarcastic smile to the Baroness, \"So you have to take counsel of\r\nFrancis again, I see?\" The Baroness cast down her eyes blushing, whilst\r\nold Francis breaking off terrified, suddenly threw himself into\r\nmilitary posture, his head erect, and his arms close and straight down\r\nhis side. The old aunts came sailing down upon us in their stuff gowns\r\nand carried off the Baroness. Lady Adelheid followed her, and I was\r\nleft alone as if spell-bound. A struggle began to rage within me\r\nbetween my rapturous anticipations of now being able to be near her\r\nwhom I adored, who completely swayed all my thoughts and feelings, and\r\nmy sulky ill-humour and annoyance at the Baron, whom I regarded as a\r\nbarbarous tyrant. If he were not, would the grey-haired old servant\r\nhave assumed such a slavish attitude?\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear? Can you see, I say?\" cried my great-uncle, tapping me on\r\nthe shoulder;--we were going upstairs to our own apartments. \"Don't\r\nforce yourself so on the Baroness's attention,\" he said when we reached\r\nthe room. \"What good can come of it? Leave that to the young fops who\r\nlike to pay court to ladies; there are plenty of them to do it.\" I\r\nrelated how it had all come about, and challenged him to say if I had\r\ndeserved his reproof. His only reply to this, however, was, \"Humph!\r\nhumph!\" as he drew on his dressing-gown. Then, having lit his pipe, he\r\ntook his seat in his easy-chair and began to talk about the adventures\r\nof the hunt on the preceding day, bantering me on my bad shots. All was\r\nquiet in the castle; all the visitors, both gentlemen and ladies, were\r\nbusy in their own rooms dressing for the evening. For the musicians\r\nwith the twanging fiddles, untuned violoncellos, and braying oboes, of\r\nwhom Lady Adelheid had spoken, were come, and a merrymaking of no less\r\nimportance than a ball, to be given in the best possible style, was in\r\nanticipation. My old uncle, preferring a quiet sleep to such foolish\r\npastimes, stayed in his chamber. I, however, had just finished dressing\r\nwhen there came a light tap at our door, and Francis entered. Smiling\r\nin his self-satisfied way, he announced to me that the manichord had\r\njust arrived from the land-steward's lady in a sledge, and had been\r\ncarried into the Baroness's apartments. Lady Adelheid sent her\r\ncompliments and would I go over at once. It may be conceived how my\r\npulse beat, and also with what a delicious tremor at heart I opened the\r\ndoor of the room in which I was to find _her_. Lady Adelheid came to\r\nmeet me with a joyful smile. The Baroness, already in full dress for\r\nthe ball, was sitting in a meditative attitude beside the mysterious\r\ncase or box, in which slumbered the music that I was called upon to\r\nawaken. When she rose, her beauty shone upon me with such glorious\r\nsplendour that I stood staring at her unable to utter a word. \"Come,\r\nTheodore\"--(for, according to the kindly custom of the North, which is\r\nfound again farther south, she addressed everybody by his or her\r\nChristian name)--\"Come, Theodore,\" she said pleasantly, \"here's the\r\ninstrument come. Heaven grant it be not altogether unworthy of your\r\nskill!\" As I opened the lid I was greeted by the rattling of a score of\r\nbroken strings, and when I attempted to strike a chord, the effect was\r\nhideous and abominable, for all the strings which were not broken were\r\ncompletely out of tune. \"I doubt not our friend the organist has been\r\nputting his delicate little hands upon it again,\" said Lady Adelheid\r\nlaughing; but the Baroness was very much annoyed and said, \"Oh, it\r\nreally is a slice of bad luck! I am doomed, I see, never to have any\r\npleasure here.\" I searched in the case of the instrument, and\r\nfortunately found some coils of strings, but no tuning-key anywhere.\r\nHence fresh laments. \"Any key will do if the ward will fit on the\r\npegs,\" I explained; then both Lady Adelheid and the Baroness ran\r\nbackwards and forwards in gay spirits, and before long a whole magazine\r\nof bright keys lay before me on the sounding-board.\r\n\r\nThen I set to work diligently, and both the ladies assisted me all they\r\ncould, trying first one peg and then another. At length one of the\r\ntiresome keys fitted, and they exclaimed joyfully, \"This will do! it\r\nwill do!\" But when I had drawn the first creaking string up to just\r\nproper pitch, it suddenly snapped, and the ladies recoiled in alarm.\r\nThe Baroness, handling the brittle wires with her delicate little\r\nfingers, gave me the numbers as I wanted them, and carefully held the\r\ncoil whilst I unrolled it. Suddenly one of them coiled itself up again\r\nwith a whirr, making the Baroness utter an impatient \"Oh!\" Lady\r\nAdelheid enjoyed a hearty laugh, whilst I pursued the tangled coil to\r\nthe corner of the room. After we had all united our efforts to extract\r\na perfectly straight string from it, and had tried it again, to our\r\nmortification it again broke; but at last--at last we found some good\r\ncoils; the strings began to hold, and gradually the discordant jangling\r\ngave place to pure melodious chords. \"Ha! it will go! it will go! The\r\ninstrument is getting in tune!\" exclaimed the Baroness, looking at me\r\nwith her lovely smile. How quickly did this common interest banish all\r\nthe strangeness and shyness which the artificial manners of social\r\nintercourse impose. A kind of confidential familiarity arose between\r\nus, which, burning through me like an electric current, consumed the\r\ntimorous nervousness and constraint which had lain like ice upon my\r\nheart. That peculiar mood of diffused melting sadness which is\r\nengendered of such love as mine was had quite left me; and accordingly,\r\nwhen the pianoforte was brought into something like tune, instead of\r\ninterpreting my deeper feelings in dreamy improvisations, as I had\r\nintended, I began with those sweet and charming canzonets which have\r\nreached us from the South. During this or the other _Senza di te_\r\n(Without thee), or _Sentimi idol mio_ (Hear me, my darling), or _Almen\r\nse nonpos'io_ (At least if I cannot), with numberless _Morir mi sentos_\r\n(I feel I am dying), and _Addios_ (Farewell), and _O dios!_ (O\r\nHeaven!), a brighter and brighter brilliancy shone in Seraphina's\r\neyes. She had seated herself close beside me at the instrument; I felt\r\nher breath fanning my cheek; and as she placed her arm behind me\r\non the chair-back, a white ribbon, getting disengaged from her\r\nbeautiful ball-dress, fell across my shoulder, where by my singing and\r\nSeraphina's soft sighs it was kept in a continual flutter backwards and\r\nforwards, like a true love-messenger. It is a wonder how I kept from\r\nlosing my head.\r\n\r\nAs I was running my fingers aimlessly over the keys, thinking of a new\r\nsong, Lady Adelheid, who had been sitting in one of the corners of the\r\nroom, ran across to us, and, kneeling down before the Baroness, begged\r\nher, as she took both her hands and clasped them to her bosom, \"Oh,\r\ndear Baroness! darling Seraphina! now you must sing too.\" To this she\r\nreplied, \"Whatever are you thinking about, Adelheid? How could I dream\r\nof letting our virtuoso friend hear such poor singing as mine?\" And she\r\nlooked so lovely, as, like a shy good child, she cast down her eyes and\r\nblushed, timidly contending with the desire to sing. That I too added\r\nmy entreaties can easily be imagined; nor, upon her making mention of\r\nsome little Courland _Volkslieder_ or popular songs, did I desist from\r\nmy entreaties until she stretched out her left hand towards the\r\ninstrument and tried a few notes by way of introduction. I rose to make\r\nway for her at the piano, but she would not permit me to do so,\r\nasserting that she could not play a single chord, and for that reason,\r\nsince she would have to sing without accompaniment, her performance\r\nwould be poor and uncertain. She began in a sweet voice, pure as a\r\nbell, that came straight from her heart, and sang a song whose simple\r\nmelody bore all the characteristics of those _Volkslieder_ which\r\nproceed from the lips with such a lustrous brightness, so to speak,\r\nthat we cannot help perceiving in the glad light which surrounds us our\r\nown higher poetic nature. There lies a mysterious charm in the\r\ninsignificant words of the text which converts them into a hieroglyphic\r\nscroll representative of the unutterable emotions which throng our\r\nhearts. Who does not know that Spanish canzonet the substance of which\r\nis in words little more than, \"With my maiden I embarked on the sea; a\r\nstorm came on, and my timid maiden was tossed up and down: nay, I will\r\nnever again embark on the sea with my maiden?\" And the Baroness's\r\nlittle song contained nothing more than, \"Lately I was dancing with my\r\nsweetheart at a wedding; a flower fell out of my hair; he picked it up\r\nand gave it me, and said, 'When, sweetheart mine, shall we go to a\r\nwedding again?'\" When, on her beginning the second verse of the song, I\r\nplayed an _arpeggio_ accompaniment, and further when, in the\r\ninspiration which now took possession of me, I at once stole from the\r\nBaroness's own lips the melodies of the other songs she sang, I\r\ndoubtless appeared in her eyes, and in those of the Lady Adelheid, to\r\nbe one of the greatest of masters in the art of music, for they\r\noverwhelmed me with enthusiastic praise. The lights and illuminations\r\nfrom the ball-room, situated in one of the wings of the castle, now\r\nshone across into the Baroness's chamber, whilst a discordant bleating\r\nof trumpets and French horns announced that it was time to gather for\r\nthe ball. \"Oh, now I must go,\" said the Baroness. I started up from the\r\npianoforte. \"You have afforded me a delightful hour; these have been\r\nthe pleasantest moments I have ever spent in R--sitten,\" she added,\r\noffering me her hand; and as in the extreme intoxication of delight I\r\npressed it to my lips, I felt her fingers close upon my hand with a\r\nsudden convulsive tremor. I do not know how I managed to reach my\r\nuncle's chamber, and still less how I got into the ball-room. There was\r\na certain Gascon who was afraid to go into battle since he was all\r\nheart, and every wound would be fatal to him. I might be compared to\r\nhim; and so might everybody else who is in the same mood that I\r\nwas in; every touch was then fatal. The Baroness's hand--her tremulous\r\nfingers--had affected me like a poisoned arrow; my blood was burning in\r\nmy veins.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning my old uncle, without asking any direct\r\nquestions, had soon drawn from me a full account of the hour I had\r\nspent in the Baroness's society, and I was not a little abashed when\r\nthe smile vanished from his lips and the jocular note from his words,\r\nand he grew serious all at once, saying, \"Cousin, I beg you will resist\r\nthis folly which is taking such a powerful hold upon you. Let me tell\r\nyou that your present conduct, as harmless as it now appears, may lead\r\nto the most terrible consequences. In your thoughtless fatuity you are\r\nstanding on a thin crust of ice, which may break under you ere you are\r\naware of it, and let you in with a plunge. I shall take good care not\r\nto hold you fast by the coat-tails, for I know you will scramble out\r\nagain pretty quick, and then, when you are lying sick unto death, you\r\nwill say, 'I got this little bit of a cold in a dream.' But I warn you\r\nthat a malignant fever will gnaw at your vitals, and years will pass\r\nbefore you recover yourself, and are a man again. The deuce take your\r\nmusic if you can put it to no better use than to cozen sentimental\r\nyoung women out of their quiet peace of mind.\" \"But,\" I began,\r\ninterrupting the old gentleman, \"but have I ever thought of insinuating\r\nmyself as the Baroness's lover?\" \"You puppy!\" cried the old gentleman,\r\n\"if I thought so I would pitch you out of this window.\" At this\r\njuncture the Baron entered, and put an end to the painful conversation;\r\nand the business to which I now had to turn my attention brought me\r\nback from my love-sick reveries, in which I saw and thought of nothing\r\nbut Seraphina.\r\n\r\nIn general society the Baroness only occasionally interchanged a few\r\nfriendly words with me; but hardly an evening passed in which a secret\r\nmessage was not brought to me from Lady Adelheid, summoning me to\r\nSeraphina. It soon came to pass that our music alternated with\r\nconversations on divers topics. Whenever I and Seraphina began to get\r\ntoo absorbed in sentimental dreams and vague aspirations, the Lady\r\nAdelheid, though now hardly young enough to be so naïve and droll as\r\nshe once was, yet intervened with all sorts of merry and somewhat\r\nchaotic nonsense. From several hints she let fall, I soon discovered\r\nthat the Baroness really had something preying upon her mind, even as I\r\nthought I had read in her eyes the very first moment I saw her; and I\r\nclearly discerned the hostile influence of the apparition of the\r\ncastle. Something terrible had happened or was to happen. Although I\r\nwas often strongly impelled to tell Seraphina in what way I had come in\r\ncontact with the invisible enemy, and how my old uncle had banished\r\nhim, undoubtedly for ever, I yet felt my tongue fettered by a\r\nhesitation which was inexplicable to myself even, whenever I opened my\r\nmouth to speak.\r\n\r\nOne day the Baroness failed to appear at the dinner table; it was said\r\nthat she was a little unwell, and could not leave her room. Sympathetic\r\ninquiries were addressed to the Baron as to whether her illness was of\r\na grave nature. He smiled in a very disagreeable way, in fact, it was\r\nalmost like bitter irony, and said, \"Nothing more than a slight\r\ncatarrh, which she has got from our blustering sea-breezes. They can't\r\ntolerate any sweet voices; the only sounds they will endure are the\r\nhoarse 'Halloos' of the chase.\" At these words the Baron hurled a keen\r\nsearching look at me across the table, for I sat obliquely opposite to\r\nhim. He had not spoken to his neighbour, but to me. Lady Adelheid, who\r\nsat beside me, blushed a scarlet red. Fixing her eyes upon the plate in\r\nfront of her, and scribbling about on it with her fork, she whispered,\r\n\"And yet you must see Seraphina to-day; your sweet songs shall to-day\r\nalso bring soothing and comfort to her poor heart.\" Adelheid addressed\r\nthese words to me; but at this moment it struck me that I was almost\r\napparently entangled in a base and forbidden intrigue with the\r\nBaroness, which could only end in some terrible crime. My old uncle's\r\nwarning fell heavily upon my heart. What should I do? Not see her\r\nagain? That was impossible so long as I remained in the castle; and\r\neven if I might leave the castle and return to K----, I had not the\r\nwill to do it Oh! I felt only too deeply that I was not strong enough\r\nto shake myself out of this dream, which was mocking one with delusive\r\nhopes of happiness. Adelheid I almost regarded in the light of a common\r\ngo-between; I would despise her, and yet, upon second thoughts, I could\r\nnot help being ashamed of my folly. Had anything ever happened during\r\nthose blissful evening hours which could in the least degree lead to\r\nany nearer relation with Seraphina than was permissible by propriety\r\nand morality? How dare I let the thought enter my mind that the\r\nBaroness would ever entertain any warm feeling for me? And yet I was\r\nconvinced of the danger of my situation.\r\n\r\nWe broke up from dinner earlier than usual, in order to go again after\r\nsome wolves which had been seen in the fir-wood close by the castle. A\r\nlittle hunting was just the thing I wanted in the excited frame of mind\r\nin which I then was. I expressed to my uncle my resolve to accompany\r\nthe party; he gave me an approving smile and said, \"That's right; I am\r\nglad you are going out with them for once. I shall stay at home, so you\r\ncan take my firelock with you, and buckle my whinger round your waist;\r\nin case of need it is a good and trusty weapon, if you only keep your\r\npresence of mind.\" That part of the wood in which the wolves were\r\nsupposed to lie was surrounded by the huntsmen. It was bitterly cold;\r\nthe wind howled through the firs, and drove the light snow-flakes right\r\nin my face, so that when at length it came on to be dusk I could\r\nscarcely see six paces before me. Quite benumbed by the cold, I left\r\nthe place that had been assigned to me and sought shelter deeper in the\r\nwood. There, leaning against a tree, with my firelock under my arm, I\r\nforgot the wolf-hunt entirely; my thoughts had travelled back to\r\nSeraphina's cosy room. After a time shots were heard in the far\r\ndistance; but at the same moment there was a rustling in the reed-bank,\r\nand I saw not ten paces from me a huge wolf about to run past me. I\r\ntook aim, and fired, but missed. The brute sprang towards me with\r\nglaring eyes; I should have been lost had I not had sufficient presence\r\nof mind to draw my hunting-knife, and, just as the brute was flying at\r\nme, to drive it deep into his throat, so that the blood spurted out\r\nover my hand and arm. One of the Baron's keepers, who had stood not far\r\nfrom me, came running up with a loud shout, and at his repeated\r\n\"Halloo!\" all the rest soon gathered round us. The Baron hastened up to\r\nme, saying, \"For God's sake, you are bleeding--you are bleeding. Are\r\nyou wounded?\" I assured him that I was not Then he turned to the keeper\r\nwho had stood nearest to me, and overwhelmed him with reproaches for\r\nnot having shot after me when I missed. And notwithstanding that the\r\nman maintained this to have been perfectly impossible, since in the\r\nvery same moment the wolf had rushed upon me, and any shot would have\r\nbeen at the risk of hitting me, the Baron persisted in saying that he\r\nought to have taken especial care of me as a less experienced hunter.\r\nMeanwhile the keepers had lifted up the dead animal; it was one of the\r\nlargest that had been seen for a long time; and everybody admired my\r\ncourage and resolution, although to myself what I had done appeared\r\nquite natural I had not for a moment thought of the danger I had run.\r\nThe Baron in particular seemed to take very great interest in the\r\nmatter; I thought he would never be done asking me whether, though I\r\nwas not wounded by the brute, I did not fear the ill effects that would\r\nfollow from the fright As we went back to the castle, the Baron took me\r\nby the arm like a friend, and I had to give my firelock to a keeper to\r\ncarry. He still continued to talk about my heroic deed, so that\r\neventually I came to believe in my own heroism, and lost all my\r\nconstraint and embarrassment, and felt that I had established myself\r\nin the Baron's eyes as a man of courage and uncommon resolution. The\r\nschoolboy had passed his examination successfully, was now no longer a\r\nschoolboy, and all the submissive nervousness of the schoolboy had left\r\nhim. I now conceived I had earned a right to try and gain Seraphina's\r\nfavour. Everybody knows of course what ridiculous combinations the\r\nfancy of a love-sick youth is capable of. In the castle, over the\r\nsmoking punchbowl, by the fireside, I was the hero of the hour. Besides\r\nmyself the Baron was the only one of the party who had killed a\r\nwolf--also a formidable one; the rest had to be content with ascribing\r\ntheir bad shots to the weather and the darkness, and with relating\r\nthrilling stories of their former exploits in hunting and the dangers\r\nthey had escaped. I thought, too, that I might reap an especial share\r\nof praise and admiration from my old uncle as well; and so, with a view\r\nto this end, I related to him my adventure at pretty considerable\r\nlength, nor did I forget to paint the savage brute's wild and\r\nbloodthirsty appearance in very startling colours. The old gentleman,\r\nhowever, only laughed in my face and said, \"God is powerful even in the\r\nweak.\"\r\n\r\nTired of drinking and of the company, I was going quietly along the\r\ncorridor towards the justice-hall when I saw a figure with a light slip\r\nin before me. On entering the hall I saw it was Lady Adelheid. \"This is\r\nthe way we have to wander about like ghosts or night-walkers in order\r\nto catch you, my brave slayer of wolves,\" she whispered, taking my arm.\r\nThe words \"ghosts\" and \"sleep-walkers,\" pronounced in the place where\r\nwe were, fell like lead upon my heart; they immediately brought to my\r\nrecollection the ghostly apparitions of those two awful nights. As\r\nthen, so now, the wind came howling in from the sea in deep organ-like\r\ncadences, rattling the oriel windows again and again and whistling\r\nfearfully through them, whilst the moon cast her pale gleams exactly\r\nupon the mysterious part of the wall where the scratching had been\r\nheard. I fancied I discerned stains of blood upon it. Doubtless Lady\r\nAdelheid, who still had hold of my hand, must have felt the cold icy\r\nshiver which ran through me. \"What's the matter with you?\" she\r\nwhispered softly; \"what's the matter with you? You are as cold as\r\nmarble. Come, I will call you back into life. Do you know how very\r\nimpatient the Baroness is to see you? And until she does see you she\r\nwill not believe that the ugly wolf has not really bitten you. She is\r\nin a terrible state of anxiety about you. Why, my friend,--oh! how have\r\nyou awakened this interest in the little Seraphina? I have never seen\r\nher like this. Ah!--so now the pulse is beginning to prickle; see how\r\nquickly the dead man comes to life! Well, come along--but softly,\r\nstill! Come, we must go to the little Baroness.\" I suffered myself to\r\nbe led away in silence. The way in which Adelheid spoke of the Baroness\r\nseemed to me undignified, and the innuendo of an understanding between\r\nus positively shameful. When I entered the room along with Adelheid,\r\nSeraphina, with a low-breathed \"Oh!\" advanced three or four paces\r\nquickly to meet me; but then, as if recollecting herself, she stood\r\nstill in the middle of the room. I ventured to take her hand and press\r\nit to my lips. Allowing it to rest in mine, she asked, \"But, for\r\nHeaven's sake! is it your business to meddle with wolves? Don't you\r\nknow that the fabulous days of Orpheus and Amphion are long past, and\r\nthat wild beasts have quite lost all respect for even the most\r\nadmirable of singers?\" But this gleeful turn, by which the Baroness at\r\nonce effectually guarded against all misinterpretation of her warm\r\ninterest in me, I was put immediately into the proper key and the\r\nproper mood. Why I did not take my usual place at the pianoforte I\r\ncannot explain, even to myself, nor why I sat down beside the Baroness\r\non the sofa. Her question, \"And what were you doing then to get into\r\ndanger?\" was an indication of our tacit agreement that conversation,\r\nnot music, was to engage our attention for that evening. After I had\r\nnarrated my adventure in the wood, and mentioned the warm interest\r\nwhich the Baron had taken in it, delicately hinting that I had not\r\nthought him capable of so much feeling, the Baroness began in a tender\r\nand almost melancholy tone, \"Oh! how violent and rude you must think\r\nthe Baron; but I assure you it is only whilst we are living within\r\nthese gloomy, ghostly walls, and during the time there is hunting going\r\non in the dismal fir-forests, that his character completely changes, at\r\nleast his outward behaviour does. What principally disquiets him in\r\nthis unpleasant way is the thought, which constantly haunts him, that\r\nsomething terrible will happen here. And that undoubtedly accounts for\r\nthe fact of his being so greatly agitated by your adventure, which\r\nfortunately has had no ill consequences. He won't have the meanest of\r\nhis servants exposed to danger, if he knows it, still less a new-won\r\nfriend whom he has come to like; and I am perfectly certain that\r\nGottlieb, whom he blames for having left you in the lurch, will be\r\npunished; even if he escapes being locked up in a dungeon, he will yet\r\nhave to suffer the punishment, so mortifying to a hunter, of going out\r\nthe next time there is a hunt with only a club in his hand instead of a\r\nrifle. The circumstance that hunts like those which are held here are\r\nalways attended with danger, and the fact that the Baron, though always\r\nfearing some sad accident, is yet so fond of hunting that he cannot\r\ndesist from provoking the demon of mischief, make his existence here a\r\nkind of conflict, the ill effects of which I also have to feel. Many\r\nqueer stories are current about his ancestor who established the\r\nentail; and I know myself that there is some dark family secret locked\r\nwithin these walls like a horrible ghost which drives away the\r\nowners, and makes it impossible for them to bear with it longer than a\r\nfew weeks at a time--and that only amid a tumult of jovial guests. But\r\nI--Oh! how lonely I am in the midst of this noisy, merry company! And\r\nhow the ghostly influences which breathe upon me from the walls stir\r\nand excite my very heart! You, my dear friend, have given me, through\r\nyour musical skill, the first cheerful moments I have spent here. How\r\ncan I thank you sufficiently for your kindness!\" I kissed the hand she\r\noffered to me, saying, that even on the very first day, or rather\r\nduring the very first night, I had experienced the ghostliness of the\r\nplace in all its horrors. The Baroness fixed her staring eyes upon my\r\nface, as I went on to describe the ghostly character of the building,\r\ndiscernible everywhere throughout the castle, particularly in the\r\ndecorations of the justice-hall, and to speak of the roaring of the\r\nwind from the sea, &c. Possibly my voice and my expressions indicated\r\nthat I had something more in my mind than what I said; at any rate when\r\nI concluded, the Baroness cried vehemently, \"No, no; something dreadful\r\nhas happened to you in that hall, which I never enter without\r\nshuddering. I beg you--pray, pray, tell me all.\"\r\n\r\nSeraphina's face had grown deadly pale; and I saw plainly that it would\r\nbe more advisable to give her a faithful account of all that I had\r\nexperienced than to leave her excited imagination to conjure up some\r\napparition that might perhaps, in a way I could not foresee, be far\r\nmore horrible than what I had actually encountered. As she listened to\r\nme her fear and strained anxiety increased from moment to moment; and\r\nwhen I mentioned the scratching on the wall she screamed, \"It's\r\nhorrible! Yes, yes, it's in that wall that the awful secret is\r\nconcealed!\" But as I went on to describe with what spiritual power and\r\nsuperiority of will my old uncle had banished the ghost, she sighed\r\ndeeply, as though she had shaken off a heavy burden that had weighed\r\noppressively upon her. She leaned back in the sofa and held her hands\r\nbefore her face. Now I first noticed that Adelheid had left us. A\r\nconsiderable pause ensued, and as Seraphina still continued silent, I\r\nsoftly rose, and going to the pianoforte, endeavoured in swelling\r\nchords to invoke the bright spirits of consolation to come and deliver\r\nSeraphina from the dark influence to which my narration had subjected\r\nher. Then I soon began to sing as softly as I was able one of the Abbé\r\nSteffani's[6] canzonas. The melancholy strains of the _Ochi, perchè\r\npiangete_ (O eyes, why weep you?) roused Seraphina out of her reverie,\r\nand she listened to me with a gentle smile upon her face, and bright\r\npearl-like tears in her eyes. How am I to account for it that I kneeled\r\ndown before her, that she bent over towards me, that I threw my arms\r\nabout her, that a long ardent kiss was imprinted on my lips? How am I\r\nto account for it that I did not lose my senses when she drew me softly\r\ntowards her, how that I tore myself from her arms, and, quickly rising\r\nto my feet, hurried to the pianoforte? Turning from me, the Baroness\r\ntook a few steps towards the window, then she turned round again and\r\napproached me with an air of almost proud dignity, which was not at all\r\nusual with her. Looking me straight in the face, she said, \"Your uncle\r\nis the most worthy old man I know; he is the guardian-angel of our\r\nfamily. May he include me in his pious prayers!\" I was unable to utter\r\na word; the subtle poison that I had imbibed with her kiss burned and\r\nboiled in every pulse and nerve. Lady Adelheid came in. The violence of\r\nmy inward conflict burst out at length in a passionate flood of tears,\r\nwhich I was unable to repress. Adelheid looked at me with wonder and\r\nsmiled dubiously;--I could have murdered her. The Baroness gave me her\r\nhand, and said with inexpressible gentleness, \"Farewell, my dear\r\nfriend. Fare you right well; and remember that nobody perhaps has ever\r\nunderstood your music better than I have. Oh! these notes! they will\r\necho long, long in my heart.\" I forced myself to utter a few stupid,\r\ndisconnected words, and hurried up to my uncle's room. The old\r\ngentleman had already gone to bed. I stayed in the hall, and falling\r\nupon my knees, I wept aloud; I called upon my beloved by name, I gave\r\nmyself up completely and regardlessly to all the absurd folly of a\r\nlove-sick lunatic, until at last the extravagant noise I made awoke my\r\nuncle. But his loud call, \"Cousin, I believe you have gone cranky, or\r\nelse you're having another tussle with a wolf. Be off to bed with you\r\nif you will be so very kind\"--these words compelled me to enter his\r\nroom, where I got into bed with the fixed resolve to dream only of\r\nSeraphina.\r\n\r\nIt would be somewhere past midnight when I thought I heard distant\r\nvoices, a running backwards and forwards, and an opening and banging of\r\ndoors--for I had not yet fallen asleep. I listened attentively; I heard\r\nfootsteps approaching the corridor; the hall door was opened, and soon\r\nthere came a knock at our door. \"Who is there?\" I cried. A voice from\r\nwithout answered, \"Herr Justitiarius, Herr Justitiarius, wake up, wake\r\nup!\" I recognised Francis's voice, and as I asked, \"Is the castle on\r\nfire?\" the old gentleman woke up in his turn and asked, \"Where--where\r\nis there a fire? Is it that cursed apparition again? where is it?\" \"Oh!\r\nplease get up, Herr Justitiarius,\" said Francis, \"Please get up; the\r\nBaron wants you.\" \"What does the Baron want me for?\" inquired my uncle\r\nfurther; \"what does he want me for at this time of night? does he not\r\nknow that all law business goes to bed along with the lawyer, and\r\nsleeps as soundly as he does?\" \"Oh!\" cried Francis, now anxiously;\r\n\"please, Herr Justitiarius, good sir, please get up. My lady the\r\nBaroness is dying.\" I started up with a cry of dismay. \"Open the door\r\nfor Francis,\" said the old gentleman to me. I stumbled about the room\r\nalmost distracted, and could find neither door nor lock; my uncle had\r\nto come and help me. Francis came in, his face pale and troubled, and\r\nlit the candles. We had scarcely thrown on our clothes when we heard\r\nthe Baron calling in the hall, \"Can I speak to you, good V----?\" \"But\r\nwhat have you dressed for, cousin? the Baron only wanted me,\" asked the\r\nold gentleman, on the point of going out. \"I must go down--I must see\r\nher and then die,\" I replied tragically, and as if my heart were rent\r\nby hopeless grief. \"Ay, just so; you are right, cousin,\" he said,\r\nbanging the door to in my face, so that the hinges creaked, and locking\r\nit on the outside. At the first moment, deeply incensed at this\r\nrestraint, I thought of bursting the door open; but quickly reflecting\r\nthat this would entail the disagreeable consequences of a piece of\r\noutrageous insanity, I resolved to await the old gentleman's return;\r\nthen however, let the cost be what it might, I would escape his\r\nwatchfulness. I heard him talking vehemently with the Baron, and\r\nseveral times distinguished my own name, but could not make out\r\nanything further. Every moment my position grew more intolerable. At\r\nlength I heard that some one brought a message to the Baron, who\r\nimmediately hurried off. My old uncle entered the room again. \"She is\r\ndead!\" I cried, running towards him, \"And you are a stupid fool,\" he\r\ninterrupted coolly; then he laid hold upon me and forced me into a\r\nchair. \"I must go down,\" I cried, \"I must go down and see her, even\r\nthough it cost me my life.\" \"Do so, good cousin,\" said he, locking the\r\ndoor, taking out the key, and putting it in his pocket. I now flew into\r\na perfectly frantic rage; stretching out my hand towards the rifle, I\r\nscreamed, \"If you don't instantly open the door I will send this bullet\r\nthrough my brains.\" Then the old gentleman planted himself immediately\r\nin front of me, and fixing his keen piercing eyes upon me said, \"Boy,\r\ndo you think you can frighten me with your idle threats? Do you think I\r\nshould set much value on your life if you can go and throw it away in\r\nchildish folly like a broken plaything? What have you to do with the\r\nBaron's wife? who has given you the right to insinuate yourself, like a\r\ntiresome puppy, where you have no claim to be, and where you are not\r\nwanted? do you wish to go and act the love-sick swain at the solemn\r\nhour of death?\" I sank back in my chair utterly confounded After a\r\nwhile the old gentleman went on more gently, \"And now let me tell you\r\nthat this pretended illness of the Baroness is in all probability\r\nnothing. Lady Adelheid always loses her head at the least little thing.\r\nIf a rain-drop falls upon her nose, she screams, 'What fearful weather\r\nit is!' Unfortunately the noise penetrated to the old aunts, and they,\r\nin the midst of unseasonable floods of tears, put in an appearance\r\narmed with an entire arsenal of strengthening drops, elixirs of life,\r\nand the deuce knows what. A sharp fainting-fit\"---- The old gentleman\r\nchecked himself; doubtless he observed the struggle that was going on\r\nwithin me. He took a few turns through the room; then again planting\r\nhimself in front of me, he had a good hearty laugh and said, \"Cousin,\r\ncousin, what nonsensical folly have you now got in your head? Ah well!\r\nI suppose it can't be helped; the devil is to play his pretty games\r\nhere in divers sorts of ways. You have tumbled very nicely into his\r\nclutches, and now he's making you dance to a sweet tune,\" He again took\r\na few turns up and down, and again went on, \"It's no use to think of\r\nsleep now; and it occurred to me that we might have a pipe, and so\r\nspend the few hours that are left of the darkness and the night.\" With\r\nthese words he took a clay pipe from the cupboard, and proceeded to\r\nfill it slowly and carefully, humming a song to himself; then he\r\nrummaged about amongst a heap of papers, until he found a sheet,\r\nwhich he picked out and rolled into a spill and lighted. Blowing the\r\ntobacco-smoke from him in thick clouds, he said, speaking between his\r\nteeth, \"Well, cousin, what was that story about the wolf?\"\r\n\r\nI know not how it was, but this calm, quiet behaviour of the old\r\ngentleman operated strangely upon me. I seemed to be no longer in\r\nR--sitten, and the Baroness was so far, far distant from me that I\r\ncould only reach her on the wings of thought. The old gentleman's last\r\nquestion, however, annoyed me. \"But do you find my hunting exploit so\r\namusing?\" I broke in,--\"so well fitted for banter?\" \"By no means,\" he\r\nrejoined, \"by no means, cousin mine; but you've no idea what a comical\r\nface such a whipper-snapper as you cuts, and how ludicrously he acts as\r\nwell, when Providence for once in a while honours him by putting him in\r\nthe way to meet with something out of the usual run of things. I once\r\nhad a college friend who was a quiet, sober fellow, and always on good\r\nterms with himself. By accident he became entangled in an affair of\r\nhonour,--I say by accident, because he himself was never in any way\r\naggressive; and although most of the fellows looked upon him as a poor\r\nthing, as a poltroon, he yet showed so much firm and resolute courage\r\nin this affair as greatly to excite everybody's admiration. But from\r\nthat time onwards he was also completely changed. The sober and\r\nindustrious youth became a bragging, insufferable bully. He was always\r\ndrinking and rioting, and fighting about all sorts of childish trifles,\r\nuntil he was run through in a duel by the Senior[7] of an exclusive\r\ncorps. I merely tell you the story, cousin; you are at liberty to think\r\nwhat you please about it But to return to the Baroness and her\r\nillness\"---- At this moment light footsteps were heard in the hall; I\r\nfancied, too, there was an unearthly moaning in the air. \"She is dead!\"\r\nthe thought shot through me like a fatal flash of lightning. The old\r\ngentleman quickly rose to his feet and called out, \"Francis, Francis!\"\r\n\"Yes, my good Herr Justitiarius,\" he replied from without. \"Francis,\"\r\nwent on my uncle, \"rake the fire together a bit in the grate, and if\r\nyou can manage it, you had better make us a good cup or two of tea.\"\r\n\"It is devilish cold,\" and he turned to me, \"and I think we had better\r\ngo and sit round the fire and talk a little.\" He opened the door, and I\r\nfollowed him mechanically. \"How are things going on below?\" he asked.\r\n\"Oh!\" replied Francis; \"there was not much the matter. The Lady\r\nBaroness is all right again, and ascribes her bit of a fainting-fit to\r\na bad dream.\" I was going to break out into an extravagant\r\nmanifestation of joy and gladness, but a stern glance from my uncle\r\nkept me quiet \"And yet, after all, I think it would be better if we lay\r\ndown for an hour or two. You need not mind about the tea, Francis.\" \"As\r\nyou think well, Herr Justitiarius,\" replied Francis, and he left the\r\nroom with the wish that we might have a good night's rest, albeit the\r\ncocks were already crowing. \"See here, cousin,\" said the old gentleman,\r\nknocking the ashes out of his pipe on the grate, \"I think, cousin, that\r\nit's a very good thing no harm has happened to you either from wolves\r\nor from loaded rifles.\" I now saw things in the right light, and was\r\nashamed at myself to have thus given the old gentleman good grounds for\r\ntreating me like a spoiled child.\r\n\r\nNext morning he said to me, \"Be so good as to step down, good cousin,\r\nand inquire how the Baroness is. You need only ask for Lady Adelheid;\r\nshe will supply you with a full budget, I have no doubt\" You may\r\nimagine how eagerly I hastened downstairs. But just as I was about to\r\ngive a gentle knock at the door of the Baroness's anteroom, the Baron\r\ncame hurriedly out of the same. He stood still in astonishment, and\r\nscrutinised me with a gloomy searching look. \"What do you want here?\"\r\nburst from his lips. Notwithstanding that my heart beat, I controlled\r\nmyself and replied in a firm tone, \"To inquire on my uncle's behalf how\r\nmy lady, the Baroness, is?\" \"Oh! it was nothing--one of her usual\r\nnervous attacks. She is now having a quiet sleep, and will, I am sure,\r\nmake her appearance at the dinner-table quite well and cheerful. Tell\r\nhim that--tell him that.\" This the Baron said with a certain degree of\r\npassionate vehemence, which seemed to me to imply that he was more\r\nconcerned about the Baroness than he was willing to show. I turned to\r\ngo back to my uncle, when the Baron suddenly seized my arm and said,\r\nwhilst his eyes flashed fire, \"I have a word or two to say to you,\r\nyoung man.\" Here I saw the deeply injured husband before me, and feared\r\nthere would be a scene which would perhaps end ignominiously for me. I\r\nwas unarmed; but at that moment I remembered I had in my pocket the\r\ningeniously-made hunting-knife which my uncle had presented to me after\r\nwe got to R--sitten. I now followed the Baron, who led the way rapidly,\r\nwith the determination not even to spare his life if I ran any risk of\r\nbeing treated dishonourably.\r\n\r\nWe entered the Baron's own room, the door of which he locked behind\r\nhim. Now he began to pace restlessly backwards and forwards, with his\r\narms folded one over the other; then he stopped in front of me and\r\nrepeated, \"I have a word or two to say to you, young man.\" I had wound\r\nmyself up to a pitch of most daring courage, and I replied, raising my\r\nvoice, \"I hope they will be words which I may hear without resentment.\"\r\nHe stared hard at me in astonishment, as though he had failed to\r\nunderstand me. Then, fixing his eyes gloomily upon the floor, he threw\r\nhis arms behind his back, and again began to stride up and down the\r\nroom. He took down a rifle and put the ramrod down the barrel to see\r\nwhether it were loaded or not. My blood boiled in my veins; grasping my\r\nknife, I stepped close up to him, so as to make it impossible for him\r\nto take aim at me. \"That's a handsome weapon,\" he said, replacing the\r\nrifle in the corner. I retired a few paces, the Baron following me.\r\nSlapping me on the shoulder, perhaps a little more violently than was\r\nnecessary, he said, \"I daresay I seem to you, Theodore, to be excited\r\nand irritable; and I really am so, owing to the anxieties of a\r\nsleepless night. My wife's nervous attack was not in the least\r\ndangerous; that I now see plainly. But here--here in this castle, which\r\nis haunted by an evil spirit, I always dread something terrible\r\nhappening; and then it's the first time she has been ill here. And\r\nyou--you alone were to blame for it.\" \"How that can possibly be I have\r\nnot the slightest conception,\" I replied calmly. \"I wish,\" continued\r\nthe Baron, \"I wish that damned piece of mischief, my steward's wife's\r\ninstrument, were chopped up into a thousand pieces, and that you--but\r\nno, no; it was to be so, it was inevitably to be so, and I alone am to\r\nblame for all. I ought to have told you, the moment you began to play\r\nmusic in my wife's room, of the whole state of the case, and to have\r\ninformed you of my wife's temper of mind.\" I was about to speak; \"Let\r\nme go on,\" said the Baron, \"I must prevent your forming any rash\r\njudgment. You probably regard me as an uncultivated fellow, averse to\r\nthe arts; but I am not so by any means. There is a particular\r\nconsideration, however, based upon deep conviction, which constrains me\r\nto forbid the introduction here as far as possible of such music as can\r\npowerfully affect any person's mind, and to this I of course am no\r\nexception. Know that my wife suffers from a morbid excitability, which\r\nwill finally destroy all the happiness of her life. Within these\r\nstrange walls she is never quit of that strained over-excited\r\ncondition, which at other times occurs but temporarily, and then\r\ngenerally as the forerunner of a serious illness. You will ask me, and\r\nquite reasonably too, why I do not spare my delicate wife the necessity\r\nof coming to live in this weird castle, and mix amongst the wild\r\nconfusion of a hunting-party. Well, call it weakness--be it so; in a\r\nword, I cannot bring myself to leave her behind. I should be tortured\r\nby a thousand fears, and quite incapable of any serious business,\r\nfor I am perfectly sure that I should be haunted everywhere, in the\r\njustice-hall as well as in the forest, by the most horrid ideas of all\r\nkinds of fatal mischief happening to her. And, on the other hand, I\r\nbelieve that the sort of life led here cannot fail to operate upon the\r\nweakly woman like strengthening chalybeate waters. By my soul, the\r\nsea-breezes, sweeping keenly after their peculiar fashion through the\r\nfir-trees, and the deep baying of the hounds, and the merry ringing\r\nnotes of our hunting-horns _must_ get the better of all your sickly\r\nlanguishing sentimentalisings at the piano, which no man ought play in\r\n_that way_. I tell you, you are deliberately torturing my wife to\r\ndeath.\" These words he uttered with great emphasis, whilst his eyes\r\nflashed with a restless fire. The blood mounted to my head; I made a\r\nviolent gesture against the Baron with my hand; I was about to speak,\r\nbut he cut me short \"I know what you are going to say,\" he began, \"I\r\nknow what you are going to say, and I repeat that you are going the\r\nright road to kill my wife. But that you intended this I cannot of\r\ncourse for a moment maintain; and yet you will understand that I must\r\nput a stop to the thing. In short, by your playing and singing you work\r\nher up to a high pitch of excitement, and then, when she drifts without\r\nanchor and rudder on the boundless sea of dreams and visions and vague\r\naspirations which your music, like some vile charm, has summoned into\r\nexistence, you plunge her down into the depths of horror with a tale\r\nabout a fearful apparition which you say came and played pranks with\r\nyou up in the justice-hall. Your great-uncle has told me everything;\r\nbut, pray, repeat to me all you saw, or did not see, heard, felt,\r\ndivined by instinct.\"\r\n\r\nI braced myself up and narrated calmly how everything had happened from\r\nbeginning to end, the Baron merely interposing at intervals a few words\r\nexpressive of his astonishment. When I came to the part where my old\r\nuncle had met the ghost with trustful courage and had exorcised him\r\nwith a few powerful words, the Baron clasped his hands, raised them\r\nfolded towards Heaven, and said with deep emotion, \"Yes, he is the\r\nguardian-angel of the family. His mortal remains shall rest in the\r\nvault of my ancestors.\" When I finished my narration, the Baron\r\nmurmured to himself, \"Daniel, Daniel, what are you doing here at this\r\nhour?\" as he folded his arms and strode up and down the room. \"And was\r\nthat all, Herr Baron?\" I asked, making a movement as though I would\r\nretire. Starting up as if out of a dream, the Baron took me kindly by\r\nthe hand and said, \"Yes, my good friend, my wife, whom you have dealt\r\nso hardly by without intending it--you must cure her again; you alone\r\ncan do so.\" I felt I was blushing, and had I stood opposite a mirror\r\nshould undoubtedly have seen in it a very blank and absurd face. The\r\nBaron seemed to exult in my embarrassment; he kept his eyes fixed\r\nintently upon my face, smiling with perfectly galling irony. \"How in\r\nthe world can I cure her?\" I managed to stammer out at length with an\r\neffort \"Well,\" he said, interrupting me, \"you have no dangerous patient\r\nto deal with at any rate. I now make an express claim upon your skill.\r\nSince the Baroness has been drawn into the enchanted circle of your\r\nmusic, it would be both foolish and cruel to drag her out of it all of\r\na sudden. Go on with your music therefore. You will always be welcome\r\nduring the evening hours in my wife's apartments. But gradually select\r\na more energetic kind of music, and effect a clever alternation of the\r\ncheerful sort with the serious; and above all things, repeat your story\r\nof the fearful ghost very very often. The Baroness will grow familiar\r\nwith it; she will forget that a ghost haunts this castle; and the story\r\nwill have no stronger effect upon her than any other tale of\r\nenchantment which is put before her in a romance or a ghost-story book.\r\nPray, do this, my good friend.\" With these words the Baron left me. I\r\nwent away. I felt as if I were annihilated, to be thus humiliated to\r\nthe level of a foolish and insignificant child. Fool that I was to\r\nsuppose that jealousy was stirring his heart! He himself sends me to\r\nSeraphina; he sees in me only the blind instrument which, after he has\r\nmade use of it, he can throw away if he thinks well. A few minutes\r\npreviously I had really feared the Baron; deep down within my heart\r\nlurked the consciousness of guilt; but it was a consciousness which\r\nallowed me to feel distinctly the beauty of the higher life for which I\r\nwas ripe. Now all had disappeared in the blackness of night; and I saw\r\nonly the stupid boy who in childish obstinacy had persisted in taking\r\nthe paper crown which he had put on his hot temples for a real golden\r\none. I hurried away to my uncle, who was waiting for me. \"Well, cousin,\r\nwhy have you been so long? Where have you been staying?\" he cried as\r\nsoon as he saw me. \"I have been having some words with the Baron!\" I\r\nquickly replied, carelessly and in a low voice, without being able to\r\nlook at the old gentleman. \"God damn it all,\" said he, feigning\r\nastonishment \"Good gracious, boy! that's just what I thought. I suppose\r\nthe Baron has challenged you, cousin?\" The ringing peal of laughter\r\nwhich the old gentleman immediately afterwards broke out into taught me\r\nthat this time too, as always, he had seen me through and through. I\r\nbit my lip, and durst not speak a word, for I knew very well that it\r\nwould only be the signal for the old gentleman to overwhelm me beneath\r\nthe torrent of teasing which was already hovering on the tip of his\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness appeared at the dinner-table in an elegant morning-robe,\r\nthe dazzling whiteness of which exceeded that of fresh-fallen snow. She\r\nlooked worn and low-spirited; but she began to speak in her soft and\r\nmelodious accents, and on raising her dark eyes there shone a sweet and\r\nyearning look full of aspiration in their voluptuous glow, and a\r\nfugitive blush flitted across her lily-white cheeks. She was more\r\nbeautiful than ever. But who can fathom the follies of a young man who\r\nhas got too hot blood in his head and heart? The bitter pique which the\r\nBaron had stirred up within me I transferred to the Baroness. The\r\nentire business seemed to me like a foul mystification; and I would now\r\nshow that I was possessed of alarmingly good common-sense and also of\r\nextraordinary sagacity. Like a petulant child, I shunned the Baroness\r\nand escaped Adelheid when she pursued me, and found a place where I\r\nwished, right at the bottom end of the table between the two officers,\r\nwith whom I began to carouse right merrily. We kept our glasses going\r\ngaily during dessert, and I was, as so frequently is the case in moods\r\nlike mine, extremely noisy and loud in my joviality. A servant brought\r\nme a plate with some bonbons on it, with the words, \"From Lady\r\nAdelheid.\" I took them; and observed on one of them, scribbled in\r\npencil, \"and Seraphina.\" My blood coursed tumultuously in my veins. I\r\nsent a glance in Adelheid's direction, which she met with a most sly\r\nand archly cunning look; and taking her glass in her hand, she gave me\r\na slight nod. Almost mechanically I murmured to myself, \"Seraphina!\"\r\nthen taking up my glass in my turn, I drained it at a single draught.\r\nMy glance fell across in _her_ direction; I perceived that she also had\r\ndrunk at the very same moment and was setting down her glass. Our eyes\r\nmet, and a malignant demon whispered in my ear, \"Unhappy wretch, she\r\ndoes love you!\" One of the guests now rose, and, in conformity with the\r\ncustom of the North, proposed the health of the lady of the house. Our\r\nglasses rang in the midst of a tumult of joy. My heart was torn with\r\nrapture and despair; the wine burned like fire within me; everything\r\nspun round in circles; I felt as if I must hasten and throw myself at\r\nher feet and there sigh out my life. \"What's the matter with you, my\r\nfriend?\" asked my neighbour, thus recalling me to myself; but Seraphina\r\nhad left the hall. We rose from the table. I was making for the door,\r\nbut Adelheid held me fast, and began to talk about divers matters; I\r\nneither heard nor understood a single word. She grasped both my hands\r\nand, laughing, shouted something in my ear. I remained dumb and\r\nmotionless, as though affected by catalepsy. All I remember is that I\r\nfinally took a glass of liqueur out of Adelheid's hand in a mechanical\r\nway and drank it off, and then I recollect being alone in a window, and\r\nafter that I rushed out of the hall, down the stairs, and ran out into\r\nthe wood. The snow was falling in thick flakes; the fir-trees were\r\nmoaning as they waved to and fro in the wind. Like a maniac I ran round\r\nand round in wide circles, laughing and screaming loudly, \"Look, look\r\nand see. Aha! Aha! The devil is having a fine dance with the boy who\r\nthought he would taste of strictly forbidden fruit!\" Who can tell what\r\nwould have been the end of my mad prank if I had not heard my name\r\ncalled loudly from the outside of the wood? The storm had abated; the\r\nmoon shone out brightly through the broken clouds; I heard dogs\r\nbarking, and perceived a dark figure approaching me. It was the old man\r\nFrancis. \"Why, why, my good Herr Theodore,\" he began, \"you have quite\r\nlost your way in the rough snow-storm. The Herr Justitiarius is\r\nawaiting you with much impatience.\" I followed the old man in silence.\r\nI found my great-uncle working in the justice-hall. \"You have done\r\nwell,\" he cried, on seeing me, \"you have done a very wise thing to go\r\nout in the open air a little and get cool. But don't drink quite so\r\nmuch wine; you are far too young, and it's not good for you.\" I did not\r\nutter a word in reply, and also took my place at the table in silence.\r\n\"But now tell me, good cousin, what it was the Baron really wanted you\r\nfor?\" I told him all, and concluded by stating that I would not lend\r\nmyself for the doubtful cure which the Baron had proposed. \"And\r\nit would not be practicable,\" the old gentleman interrupted, \"for\r\nto-morrow morning early we set off home, cousin.\" And so it was that I\r\nnever saw Seraphina again.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we arrived in K---- my old uncle complained that he felt\r\nthe effects of the wearying journey this time more than ever. His\r\nmoody silence, broken only by violent outbreaks of the worst possible\r\nill-humour, announced the return of his attacks of gout. One day I was\r\nsuddenly called in; I found the old gentleman confined to his bed and\r\nunable to speak, suffering from a paralytic stroke. He held a letter in\r\nhis hand, which he had crumpled up tightly in a spasmodic fit. I\r\nrecognised the hand-writing of the land-steward of R--sitten; but,\r\nquite upset by my trouble, I did not venture to take the letter out of\r\nthe old gentleman's hand. I did not doubt that his end was near. But\r\nhis pulse began to beat again, even before the physician arrived; the\r\nold gentleman's remarkably tough constitution resisted the mortal\r\nattack, although he was in his seventieth year. That selfsame day the\r\ndoctor pronounced him out of danger.\r\n\r\nWe had a more severe winter than usual; this was followed by a rough\r\nand stormy spring; and hence it was more the gout--a consequence of the\r\ninclemency of the season--than his previous accident which kept him for\r\na long time confined to his bed. During this period he made up his mind\r\nto retire altogether from all kinds of business. He transferred his\r\noffice of Justitiarius to others; and so I was cut off from all hope of\r\never again going to R--sitten. The old gentleman would allow no one to\r\nattend him but me; and it was to me alone that he looked for all\r\namusement and every cheerful diversion. And though, in the hours when\r\nhe was free from pain, his good spirits returned, and he had no lack of\r\nbroad jests, even making mention of hunting exploits, so that I fully\r\nexpected every minute to hear him make a butt of my heroic deed, when I\r\nhad killed the wolf with my whinger, yet never once did he allude to\r\nour visit to R--sitten, and as may well be imagined, I was very\r\ncareful, from natural shyness, not to lead him directly up to the\r\nsubject. My harassing anxiety and continual attendance upon the old\r\ngentleman had thrust Seraphina's image into the background. But as soon\r\nas his sickness abated somewhat, my thoughts returned with more\r\nliveliness to that moment in the Baroness's room, which I now looked\r\nupon as a star--a bright star--that had set, for me at least, for ever.\r\nAn occurrence which now happened, by making me shudder with an ice-cold\r\nthrill as at sight of a visitant from the world of spirits, revived\r\nall the pain I had formerly felt. One evening, as I was opening the\r\npocket-book which I had carried whilst at R--sitten, there fell out of\r\nthe papers I was unfolding a dark curl, wrapped about with a white\r\nribbon; I immediately recognised it as Seraphina's hair. But, on\r\nexamining the ribbon more closely, I distinctly perceived the mark of a\r\nspot of blood on it! Perhaps Adelheid had skilfully contrived to\r\nsecrete it about me during the moments of conscious insanity by which I\r\nhad been affected during the last days of our visit; but why was the\r\nspot of blood there? It excited forebodings of something terrible in my\r\nmind, and almost converted this too pastoral love-token into an awful\r\nadmonition, pointing to a passion which might entail the expenditure of\r\nprecious blood. It was the same white ribbon that had fluttered about\r\nme in light wanton sportiveness as it were the first time I sat near\r\nSeraphina, and which Mysterious Night had stamped as an emblem of\r\nmortal injury. Boys ought not to play with weapons with the dangerous\r\nproperties of which they are not familiar.\r\n\r\nAt last the storms of spring had ceased to bluster, and summer asserted\r\nher rights; and if the cold had formerly been unbearable, so now too\r\nwas the heat when July came in. The old gentleman visibly gathered\r\nstrength, and following his usual custom, went out to a garden in the\r\nsuburbs. One still, warm evening, as we sat in the sweet-smelling\r\njasmine arbour, he was in unusually good spirits, and not, as was\r\ngenerally the case, overflowing with sarcasm and irony, but in a gentle\r\nand almost soft and melting mood. \"Cousin,\" he began, \"I don't know how\r\nit is, but I feel so nice and warm and comfortable all over to-day; I\r\nhave not felt like it for many years. I believe it is an augury that I\r\nshall die soon.\" I exerted myself to drive these gloomy thoughts from\r\nhis mind. \"Never mind, cousin,\" he said, \"in any case I'm not long for\r\nthis world; and so I will now discharge a debt I owe you. Do you still\r\nremember our autumn in R--sitten?\" This question thrilled through me\r\nlike a lightning-flash, so before I was able to make any reply he\r\ncontinued, \"It was Heaven's will that your entrance into that castle\r\nshould be signalised by memorable circumstances, and that you should\r\nbecome involved against your own will in the deepest secrets of the\r\nhouse. The time has now come when you must learn all. We have often\r\nenough talked about things which you, cousin, rather dimly guessed at\r\nthan really understood. In the alternation of the seasons nature\r\nrepresents symbolically the cycle of human life. That is a trite\r\nremark; but I interpret it differently from everybody else. The dews of\r\nspring fall, summer's vapours fade away, and it is the pure atmosphere\r\nof autumn which clearly reveals the distant landscape, and then finally\r\nearthly existence is swallowed in the night of winter. I mean that the\r\ngovernment of the Power Inscrutable is more plainly revealed in the\r\nclear-sightedness of old age. It is granted glimpses of the promised\r\nland, the pilgrimage to which begins with the death on earth. How\r\nclearly do I see at this moment the dark destiny of that house, to\r\nwhich I am knit by firmer ties than blood relationship can weave!\r\nEverything lies disclosed to the eyes of my spirit. And yet the things\r\nwhich I now see, in the form in which I see them--the essential\r\nsubstance of them, that is--this I cannot tell you in words; for no\r\nman's tongue is able to do so. But listen, my son, I will tell you\r\nas well as I am able, and do you think it is some remarkable story\r\nthat might really happen; and lay up carefully in your soul the\r\nknowledge that the mysterious relations into which you ventured to\r\nenter, not perhaps without being summoned, might have ended in your\r\ndestruction--but--that's all over now.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the R---- entail, which my old uncle told me, I retain\r\nso faithfully in my memory even now that I can almost repeat it in his\r\nown words (he spoke of himself in the third person).\r\n\r\nOne stormy night in the autumn of 1760 the servants of R--sitten were\r\nstartled out of the midst of their sleep by a terrific crash, as if the\r\nwhole of the spacious castle had tumbled into a thousand pieces. In a\r\nmoment everybody was on his legs; lights were lit; the house-steward,\r\nhis face deadly pale with fright and terror, came up panting with his\r\nkeys; but as they proceeded through the passages and halls and rooms,\r\nsuite after suite, and found all safe, and heard in the appalling\r\nsilence nothing except the creaking rattle of the locks, which\r\noccasioned some difficulty in opening, and the ghost-like echo of their\r\nown footsteps, they began one and all to be utterly astounded. Nowhere\r\nwas there the least trace of damage. The old house-steward was\r\nimpressed by an ominous feeling of apprehension. He went up into the\r\ngreat Knight's Hall, which had a small cabinet adjoining where Freiherr\r\nRoderick von R---- used to sleep when engaged in making his\r\nastronomical observations. Between the door of this cabinet and\r\nthat of a second was a postern, leading through a narrow passage\r\nimmediately into the astronomical tower. But directly Daniel (that was\r\nthe house-steward's name) opened this postern, the storm, blustering\r\nand howling terrifically, drove a heap of rubbish and broken pieces of\r\nstones all over him, which made him recoil in terror; and, dropping\r\nthe candles, which went out with a hiss on the floor, he screamed, \"O\r\nGod! O God! The Baron! he's miserably dashed to pieces!\" At the same\r\nmoment he heard sounds of lamentation proceeding from the Freiherr's\r\nsleeping-cabinet, and on entering it he saw the servants gathered\r\naround their master's corpse. They had found him fully dressed and more\r\nmagnificently than on any previous occasion, and with a calm earnest\r\nlook upon his unchanged countenance, sitting in his large and richly\r\ndecorated arm-chair as though resting after severe study. But his rest\r\nwas the rest of death. When day dawned it was seen that the crowning\r\nturret of the tower had fallen in. The huge square stones had broken\r\nthrough the ceiling and floor of the observatory-room, and then,\r\ncarrying down in front of them a powerful beam that ran across the\r\ntower, they had dashed in with redoubled impetus the lower vaulted\r\nroof, and dragged down a portion of the castle walls and of the narrow\r\nconnecting-passage. Not a single step could be taken beyond the postern\r\nthreshold without risk of falling at least eighty feet into a deep\r\nchasm.\r\n\r\nThe old Freiherr had foreseen the very hour of his death, and had sent\r\nintelligence of it to his sons. Hence it happened that the very next\r\nday saw the arrival of Wolfgang, Freiherr von R----, eldest son of the\r\ndeceased, and now lord of the entail. Relying confidently upon the\r\nprobable truth of the old man's foreboding, he had left Vienna, which\r\ncity he chanced to have reached in his travels, immediately he received\r\nthe ominous letter, and hastened to R--sitten as fast as he could\r\ntravel. The house-steward had draped the great hall in black, and had\r\nhad the old Freiherr laid out in the clothes in which he had been\r\nfound, on a magnificent state-bed, and this he had surrounded with tall\r\nsilver candlesticks with burning wax-candles. Wolfgang ascended the\r\nstairs, entered the hall, and approached close to his father's corpse,\r\nwithout speaking a word. There he stood with his arms folded on his\r\nchest, gazing with a fixed and gloomy look and with knitted brows, into\r\nhis father's pale countenance. He was like a statue; not a tear came\r\nfrom his eyes. At length, with an almost convulsive movement of the\r\nright arm towards the corpse, he murmured hoarsely, \"Did the stars\r\ncompel you to make the son whom you loved miserable?\" Throwing his\r\nhands behind his back and stepping a short pace backwards, the Baron\r\nraised his eyes upwards and said in a low and well-nigh broken voice,\r\n\"Poor, infatuated old man! Your carnival farce with its shallow\r\ndelusions is now over. Now you no doubt see that the possessions which\r\nare so niggardly dealt out to us here on earth have nothing in common\r\nwith Hereafter beyond the stars. What will--what power can reach over\r\nbeyond the grave?\" The Baron was silent again for some seconds, then he\r\ncried passionately, \"No, your perversity shall not rob me of a grain of\r\nmy earthly happiness, which you strove so hard to destroy,\" and\r\ntherewith he took a folded paper out of his pocket and held it up\r\nbetween two fingers to one of the burning candles that stood close\r\nbeside the corpse. The paper was caught by the flame and blazed up\r\nhigh; and as the reflection flickered and played upon the face of the\r\ncorpse, it was as though its muscles moved and as though the old man\r\nuttered toneless words, so that the servants who stood some distance\r\noff were filled with great horror and awe. The Baron calmly finished\r\nwhat he was doing by carefully stamping out with his foot the last\r\nfragment of paper that fell on the floor blazing. Then, casting yet\r\nanother moody glance upon his father, he hurriedly left the hall.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Daniel reported to the Freiherr the damage that\r\nhad been done to the tower, and described at great length all that had\r\ntaken place on the night when their dear dead master died; and he\r\nconcluded by saying that it would be a very wise thing to have the\r\ntower repaired at once, for, if a further fall were to take place,\r\nthere would be some danger of the whole castle--well, if not tumbling\r\ndown, at any rate suffering serious damage.\r\n\r\n\"Repair the tower?\" the Freiherr interrupted the old servant curtly,\r\nwhilst his eyes flashed with anger, \"Repair the tower? Never, never!\r\nDon't you see, old man,\" he went on more calmly, \"don't you see that\r\nthe tower could not fall in this way without some special cause? How if\r\nit was my father's own wish that the place where he carried on his\r\nunhallowed astrological labours should be destroyed--how if he had\r\nhimself made certain preparations by which he was enabled to bring down\r\nthe turret whenever he pleased and so occasion the ruin of the interior\r\nof the tower! But be that as it may. And if the whole castle tumbles\r\ndown, I shan't care; I shall be glad. Do you imagine I am going to\r\ndwell in this weird owls' nest? No; my wise ancestor who had the\r\nfoundations of a new castle laid in the beautiful valley yonder--he has\r\nbegun a work which I intend to finish.\" Daniel said crestfallen, \"Then\r\nwill all your faithful old servants have to take up their bundles and\r\ngo?\" \"That I am not going to be waited upon by helpless, weak-kneed old\r\nfellows like you is quite certain; but for all that I shall turn none\r\naway. You may all enjoy the bread of charity without working for it.\"\r\n\"And am I,\" cried the old man, greatly hurt, \"am I, the house-steward,\r\nto be forced to lead such a life of inactivity?\" Then the Freiherr, who\r\nhad turned his back upon the old man and was about to leave the room,\r\nwheeled suddenly round, his face perfectly ablaze with passion, strode\r\nup to the old man as he stretched out his doubled fist towards him, and\r\nshouted in a thundering voice, \"You, you hypocritical old villain, it's\r\nyou who helped my old father in his unearthly practices up yonder; you\r\nlay upon his heart like a vampire; and perhaps it was you who basely\r\ntook advantage of the old man's mad folly to plant in his mind those\r\ndiabolical ideas which brought me to the brink of ruin. I ought, I tell\r\nyou, to kick you out like a mangy cur.\" The old man was so terrified at\r\nthese harsh terrible words that he threw himself upon his knees beside\r\nthe Freiherr; but the Baron, as he spoke these last words, threw\r\nforward his right foot, perhaps quite unintentionally (as is frequently\r\nthe case in anger, when the body mechanically obeys the mind, and what\r\nis in the thought is imitatively realised in action) and hit the old\r\nman so hard on the chest that he rolled over with a stifled scream.\r\nRising painfully to his feet and uttering a most singular sound, like\r\nthe howling whimper of an animal wounded to death, he looked the\r\nFreiherr through and through with a look that glared with mingled rage\r\nand despair. The purse of money which the Freiherr threw down as he\r\nwent out of the room, the old man left lying on the floor where it\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile all the nearest relatives of the family who lived in the\r\nneighbourhood had arrived, and the old Freiherr was interred with much\r\npomp in the family vault in the church at R--sitten; and now, after the\r\ninvited guests had departed, the new lord of the entail appeared to\r\nshake off his gloomy mood, and to be prepared to duly enjoy the\r\nproperty that had fallen to him. Along with V----, the old Freiherr's\r\nJustitiarius, who won his full confidence in the very first interview\r\nthey had, and who was at once confirmed in his office, the Baron made\r\nan exact calculation of his sources of income, and considered how large\r\na part he could devote to making improvements and how large a part to\r\nbuilding a new castle. V---- was of opinion that the old Freiherr could\r\nnot possibly have spent all his income every year, and that there must\r\ncertainly be money concealed somewhere, since he had found nothing\r\namongst his papers except one or two bank-notes for insignificant\r\nsums, and the ready-money in the iron safe was but very little more\r\nthan a thousand thalers, or about £150. Who would be so likely to\r\nknow anything about it as Daniel, who in his obstinate self-willed way\r\nwas perhaps only waiting to be asked about it? The Baron was now\r\nnot a little concerned at the thought that Daniel, whom he had so\r\ngrossly insulted, might let large sums moulder somewhere sooner\r\nthan discover them to him, not so much, of course, from any motives of\r\nself-interest,--for of what use could even the largest sum of money be\r\nto him, a childless old man, whose only wish was to end his days in the\r\ncastle of R--sitten?--as from a desire to take vengeance for the\r\naffront put upon him. He gave V---- a circumstantial account of the\r\nentire scene with Daniel, and concluded by saying that from several\r\nitems of information communicated to him he had learned that it was\r\nDaniel alone who had contrived to nourish in the old Freiherr's mind\r\nsuch an inexplicable aversion to ever seeing his sons in R--sitten. The\r\nJustitiarius declared that this information was perfectly false, since\r\nthere was not a human creature on the face of the earth who would have\r\nbeen able to guide the Freiherr's thoughts in any way, far less\r\ndetermine them for him; and he undertook finally to draw from Daniel\r\nthe secret, if he had one, as to the place in which they would be\r\nlikely to find money concealed. His task proved far easier than he had\r\nanticipated, for no sooner did he begin, \"But how comes it, Daniel,\r\nthat your old master has left so little ready-money?\" than Daniel\r\nreplied, with a repulsive smile, \"Do you mean the few trifling\r\nthalers, Herr Justitiarius, which you found in the little strong box?\r\nOh! the rest is lying in the vault beside our gracious master's\r\nsleeping-cabinet. But the best,\" he went on to say, whilst his\r\nsmile passed over into an abominable grin, and his eyes flashed\r\nwith malicious fire, \"but the best of all--several thousand gold\r\npieces--lies buried at the bottom of the chasm beneath the ruins.\" The\r\nJustitiarius at once summoned the Freiherr; they proceeded there, and\r\nthen into the sleeping-cabinet, where Daniel pushed aside the wainscot\r\nin one of the corners, and a small lock became visible. Whilst the\r\nFreiherr was regarding the polished lock with covetous eyes, and making\r\npreparations to try and unlock it with the keys of the great bunch\r\nwhich he dragged with some difficulty out of his pocket, Daniel drew\r\nhimself up to his full height, and looked down with almost malignant\r\npride upon his master, who had now stooped down in order to see the\r\nlock better. Daniel's face was deadly pale, and he said, his voice\r\ntrembling, \"If I am a dog, my lord Freiherr, I have also at least a\r\ndog's fidelity.\" Therewith he held out a bright steel key to his\r\nmaster, who greedily snatched it out of his hand, and with it he\r\neasily succeeded in opening the door. They stepped into a small and\r\nlow-vaulted apartment, in which stood a large iron coffer with the\r\nlid open, containing many money-bags, upon which lay a strip of\r\nparchment, written in the old Freiherr's familiar handwriting, large\r\nand old-fashioned.\r\n\r\n One hundred and fifty thousand Imperial thalers in old _Fredericks\r\n d'or_,[8] money saved from the revenues of the estate-tail of\r\n R--sitten; this sum has been set aside for the building of the\r\n castle. Further, the lord of the entail who succeeds me in the\r\n possession of this money shall, upon the highest hill situated\r\n eastward from the old tower of the castle (which he will find in\r\n ruins), erect a high beacon tower for the benefit of mariners, and\r\n cause a fire to be kindled on it every night. R--sitten, on\r\n Michaelmas Eve of the year 1760.\r\n                                          RODERICK, FREIHERR von R.\r\n\r\nThe Freiherr lifted up the bags one after the other and let them fall\r\nagain into the coffer, delighted at the ringing clink of so much gold\r\ncoin; then he turned round abruptly to the old house-steward, thanked\r\nhim for the fidelity he had shown, and assured him that they were only\r\nvile tattling calumnies which had induced him to treat him so harshly\r\nin the first instance. He should not only remain in the castle, but\r\nshould also continue to discharge his duties, uncurtailed in any way,\r\nas house-steward, and at double the wages he was then having. \"I owe\r\nyou a large compensation; if you will take money, help yourself to one\r\nof these bags.\" As he concluded with these words, the Baron stood\r\nbefore the old man, with his eyes bent upon the ground, and pointed to\r\nthe coffer; then, approaching it again, he once more ran his eyes over\r\nthe bags. A burning flush suddenly mounted into the old house-steward's\r\ncheeks, and he uttered that awful howling whimper--a noise as of an\r\nanimal wounded to death, according to the Freiherr's previous\r\ndescription of it to the Justitiarius. The latter shuddered, for the\r\nwords which the old man murmured between his teeth sounded like, \"Blood\r\nfor gold.\" Of all this the Freiherr, absorbed in the contemplation of\r\nthe treasure before him, had heard not the least. Daniel tottered in\r\nevery limb, as if shaken by an ague fit; approaching the Freiherr with\r\nbowed head in a humble attitude, he kissed his hand, and drawing his\r\nhandkerchief across his eyes under the pretence of wiping away his\r\ntears, said in a whining voice, \"Alas! my good and gracious master,\r\nwhat am I, a poor childless old man, to do with money? But the doubled\r\nwages I accept with gladness, and will continue to do my duty\r\nfaithfully and zealously.\"\r\n\r\nThe Freiherr, who had paid no particular heed to the old man's words,\r\nnow let the heavy lid of the coffer fall to with a bang, so that the\r\nwhole room shook and cracked, and then, locking the coffer and\r\ncarefully withdrawing the key, he said carelessly, \"Very well, very\r\nwell, old man.\" But after they entered the hall he went on talking to\r\nDaniel, \"But you said something about a quantity of gold pieces buried\r\nunderneath the ruins of the tower?\" Silently the old man stepped\r\ntowards the postern, and after some difficulty unlocked it. But so soon\r\nas he threw it open the storm drove a thick mass of snow-flakes into\r\nthe hall; a raven was disturbed and flew in croaking and screaming and\r\ndashed with its black wings against the window, but regaining the open\r\npostern it disappeared downwards into the chasm. The Freiherr stepped\r\nout into the corridor; but one single glance downwards, and he started\r\nback trembling. \"A fearful sight!--I'm giddy!\" he stammered as he sank\r\nalmost fainting into the Justitiarius' arms. But quickly recovering\r\nhimself by an effort, he fixed a sharp look upon the old man and asked,\r\n\"Down there, you say?\" Meanwhile the old man had been locking the\r\npostern, and was now leaning against it with all his bodily strength,\r\nand was gasping and grunting to get the great key out of the rusty\r\nlock. This at last accomplished, he turned round to the Baron,\r\nand, changing the huge key about backwards and forwards in his\r\nhands, replied with a peculiar smile, \"Yes, there are thousands\r\nand thousands down there--all my dear dead master's beautiful\r\ninstruments--telescopes, quadrants, globes, dark mirrors, they all lie\r\nsmashed to atoms underneath the ruins between the stones and the big\r\nbalk.\" \"But money--coined money,\" interrupted the Baron, \"you spoke of\r\ngold pieces, old man?\" \"I only meant things which had cost several\r\nthousand gold pieces,\" he replied; and not another word could be got\r\nout of him.\r\n\r\nThe Baron appeared highly delighted to have all at once come into\r\npossession of all the means requisite for carrying out his favourite\r\nplan, namely, that of building a new and magnificent castle. The\r\nJustitiarius indeed stated it as his opinion that, according to the\r\nwill of the deceased, the money could only be applied to the repair and\r\ncomplete finishing of the interior of the old castle, and further, any\r\nnew erection would hardly succeed in equalling the commanding size and\r\nthe severe and simple character of the old ancestral castle. The\r\nFreiherr, however, persisted in his intention, and maintained that in\r\nthe disposal of property respecting which nothing was stated in the\r\ndeeds of the entail the irregular will of the deceased could have no\r\nvalidity. He at the same time led V---- to understand that he should\r\nconceive it to be his duty to embellish R--sitten as far as the\r\nclimate, soil, and environs would permit, for it was his intention to\r\nbring home shortly as his dearly loved wife a lady who was in every\r\nrespect worthy of the greatest sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe air of mystery with which the Freiherr spoke of this alliance,\r\nwhich possibly had been already consummated in secret, cut short all\r\nfurther questions from the side of the Justitiarius. Nevertheless he\r\nfound in it to some extent a redeeming feature, for the Freiherr's\r\neager grasping after riches now appeared to be due not so much to\r\navarice strictly speaking as to the desire to make one dear to him\r\nforget the more beautiful country she was relinquishing for his sake.\r\nOtherwise he could not acquit the Baron of being avaricious, or at any\r\nrate insufferably close-fisted, seeing that, even though rolling in\r\nmoney and even when gloating over the old _Fredericks d'or_, he could\r\nnot help bursting out with the peevish grumble, \"I know the old rascal\r\nhas concealed from us the greatest part of his wealth, but next spring\r\nI will have the ruins of the tower turned over under my own eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Freiherr had architects come, and discussed with them at great\r\nlength what would be the most convenient way to proceed with his\r\ncastle-building. He rejected one drawing after another; in none of them\r\nwas the style of architecture sufficiently rich and grandiose. He now\r\nbegan to draw plans himself, and, inspirited by this employment, which\r\nconstantly placed before his eyes a sunny picture of the happiest\r\nfuture, brought himself into such a genial humour that it often\r\nbordered on wild exuberance of spirits, and even communicated itself to\r\nall about him. His generosity and profuse hospitality belied all\r\nimputations of avarice at any rate. Daniel also seemed to have now\r\nforgotten the insult that had been put upon him. Towards the Freiherr,\r\nalthough often followed by him with mistrustful eyes on account of the\r\ntreasure buried in the chasm, his bearing was both quiet and humble.\r\nBut what struck everybody as extraordinary was that the old man\r\nappeared to grow younger from day to day. Possibly this might be,\r\nbecause he had begun to forget his grief for his old master, which had\r\nstricken him sore, and possibly also because he had not now, as he once\r\nhad, to spend the cold nights in the tower without sleep, and got\r\nbetter food and good wine such as he liked; but whatever the cause\r\nmight be, the old greybeard seemed to be growing into a vigorous man\r\nwith red cheeks and well-nourished body, who could walk firmly and\r\nlaugh loudly whenever he heard a jest to laugh at.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant tenor of life at R--sitten was disturbed by the arrival of\r\na man whom one would have judged to be quite in his element there. This\r\nwas Wolfgang's younger brother Hubert, at the sight of whom Wolfgang\r\nhad screamed out, with his face as pale as a corpse's, \"Unhappy wretch,\r\nwhat do you want here?\" Hubert threw himself into his brother's arms,\r\nbut Wolfgang took him and led him away up to a retired room, where he\r\nlocked himself in with him. They remained closeted several hours, at\r\nthe end of which time Hubert came down, greatly agitated, and called\r\nfor his horses. The Justitiarius intercepted him; Hubert tried to pass\r\nhim; but V----, inspired by the hope that he might perhaps stifle in\r\nthe bud what might else end in a bitter life-long quarrel between the\r\nbrothers, besought him to stay, at least a few hours, and at the same\r\nmoment the Freiherr came down calling, \"Stay here, Hubert! you will\r\nthink better of it.\" Hubert's countenance cleared up; he assumed an air\r\nof composure, and quickly pulling off his costly fur coat, and throwing\r\nit to a servant behind him, he grasped V----'s hand and went with him\r\ninto the room, saying with a scornful smile, \"So the lord of the entail\r\nwill tolerate my presence here, it seems.\" V---- thought that the\r\nunfortunate misunderstanding would assuredly be smoothed away now, for\r\nit was only separation and existence apart from each other that would,\r\nhe conceived, be able to foster it. Hubert took up the steel tongs\r\nwhich stood near the fire-grate, and as he proceeded to break up a\r\nknotty piece of wood that would only sweal, not burn, and to rake the\r\nfire together better, he said to V----, \"You see what a good-natured\r\nfellow I am, Herr Justitiarius, and that I am skilful in all domestic\r\nmatters. But Wolfgang is full of the most extraordinary prejudices,\r\nand--a bit of a miser.\" V---- did not deem it advisable to attempt to\r\nfathom further the relations between the brothers, especially as\r\nWolfgang's face and conduct and voice plainly showed that he was shaken\r\nto the very depths of his nature by diverse violent passions.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening V---- had occasion to go up to the Freiherr's room\r\nin order to learn his decision about some matter or other connected\r\nwith the estate-tail. He found him pacing up and down the room with\r\nlong strides, his arms crossed on his back, and much perturbation in\r\nhis manner. On perceiving the Justitiarius he stood still, and then,\r\ntaking him by both hands and looking him gloomily in the face, he said\r\nin a broken voice, \"My brother is come. I know what you are going to\r\nsay,\" he proceeded almost before V---- had opened his mouth to put a\r\nquestion. \"Unfortunately you know nothing. You don't know that my\r\nunfortunate brother--yes, I will not call him anything worse than\r\nunfortunate--that, like a spirit of evil, he crosses my path\r\neverywhere, ruining my peace of mind. It is not his fault that I have\r\nnot been made unspeakably miserable; he did his best to make me so, but\r\nHeaven willed it otherwise. Ever since he has known of the conversion\r\nof the property into an entail, he has persecuted me with deadly\r\nhatred. He envies me this property, which in his hands would only be\r\nscattered like chaff. He is the wildest spendthrift I ever heard of.\r\nHis load of debt exceeds by a long way the half of the unentailed\r\nproperty in Courland that fell to him, and now, pursued by his\r\ncreditors, who fail not to worry him for payment, he hurries here to me\r\nto beg for money.\" \"And you, his brother, refuse to give him any?\"\r\nV---- was about to interrupt him; but the Freiherr, letting V----'s\r\nhands fall, and taking a long step backwards, went on in a loud and\r\nvehement tone. \"Stop! yes; I refuse. I neither can nor will give away a\r\nsingle thaler of the revenues of the entail. But listen, and I will\r\ntell you what was the proposal which I made the insane fellow a few\r\nhours ago, and made in vain, and then pass judgment upon the feelings\r\nof duty by which I am actuated. Our unentailed possessions in Courland\r\nare, as you are aware, considerable; the half that falls to me I am\r\nwilling to renounce, but in favour of his family. For Hubert has\r\nmarried, in Courland, a beautiful lady, but poor. She and the children\r\nshe has borne him are starving. The estates should be put under trust;\r\nsufficient should be set aside out of the revenues to support him, and\r\nhis creditors be paid by arrangement. But what does he care for a quiet\r\nlife--a life free of anxiety?--what does he care for wife and child?\r\nMoney, ready-money, and large quantities, is what he will have, that he\r\nmay squander it in infamous folly. Some demon has made him acquainted\r\nwith the secret of the hundred and fifty thousand thalers, half of\r\nwhich he in his mad way demands, maintaining that this money is movable\r\nproperty and quite apart from the entailed portion. This, however, I\r\nmust and will refuse him, but the feeling haunts me that he is plotting\r\nmy destruction in his heart.\"\r\n\r\nNo matter how great the efforts which V---- made to persuade the\r\nFreiherr out of this suspicion against his brother, in which, of\r\ncourse, not being initiated into the more circumstantial details of the\r\ndisagreement, he could only appeal to broad and somewhat superficial\r\nmoral principles, he yet could not boast of the smallest success. The\r\nFreiherr commissioned him to treat with his hostile and avaricious\r\nbrother Hubert. V---- proceeded to do so with all the circumspection he\r\nwas master of, and was not a little gratified when Hubert at length\r\ndeclared, \"Be it so then; I will accept my brother's proposals, but\r\nupon condition that he will now, since I am on the point of losing both\r\nmy honour and my good name for ever through the severity of my\r\ncreditors, make me an advance of a thousand _Fredericks d'or_ in hard\r\ncash, and further grant that in time to come I may take up my\r\nresidence, at least for a short time occasionally, in our beautiful\r\nR--sitten, along with my good brother.\" \"Never, never!\" exclaimed\r\nthe Freiherr violently, when V---- laid his brother's amended\r\ncounter-proposals before him. \"I will never consent that Hubert stay\r\nin my house even a single minute after I have brought home my wife. Go,\r\nmy good friend, tell this mar-peace that he shall have two thousand\r\n_Fredericks d'or_, not as an advance, but as a gift--only, bid him go,\r\nbid him go.\" V---- now learned at one and the same time that the ground\r\nof the quarrel between the two brothers must be sought for in this\r\nmarriage. Hubert listened to the Justitiarius proudly and calmly, and\r\nwhen he finished speaking replied in a hoarse and hollow tone, \"I will\r\nthink it over; but for the present I shall stay a few days in the\r\ncastle.\" V---- exerted himself to prove to the discontented Hubert that\r\nthe Freiherr, by making over his share of their unentailed property,\r\nwas really doing all he possibly could do to indemnify him, and that on\r\nthe whole he had no cause for complaint against his brother, although\r\nat the same time he admitted that all institutions of the nature\r\nof primogeniture, which vested such preponderant advantages in the\r\neldest-born to the prejudice of the remaining children, were in many\r\nrespects hateful. Hubert tore his waistcoat open from top to bottom\r\nlike a man whose breast was cramped and he wanted to relieve it by\r\nfresh air. Thrusting one hand into his open shirt-frill and planting\r\nthe other in his side, he spun round on one foot in a quick pirouette\r\nand cried in a sharp voice, \"Pshaw! What is hateful is born of hatred.\"\r\nThen bursting out into a shrill fit of laughter, he said, \"What\r\ncondescension my lord of the entail shows in being thus willing to\r\nthrow his gold pieces to the poor beggar!\" V---- saw plainly that all\r\nidea of a complete reconciliation between the brothers was quite out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nTo the Freiherr's annoyance, Hubert established himself in the rooms\r\nthat had been appointed for him in one of the side wings of the castle\r\nas if with the view to a very long stay. He was observed to hold\r\nfrequent and long conversations with the house-steward; nay, the latter\r\nwas sometimes even seen to accompany him when he went out wolf-hunting.\r\nOtherwise he was very little seen, and studiously avoided meeting his\r\nbrother alone, at which the latter was very glad. V---- felt how\r\nstrained and unpleasant this state of things was, and was obliged to\r\nconfess to himself that the peculiar uneasiness which marked all that\r\nHubert both said and did was such as to destroy intentionally and\r\neffectually all the pleasure of the place. He now perfectly understood\r\nwhy the Freiherr had manifested so much alarm on seeing his brother.\r\n\r\nOne day as V---- was sitting by himself in the justice-room amongst his\r\nlaw-papers, Hubert came in with a grave and more composed manner than\r\nusual, and said in a voice that bordered upon melancholy, \"I will\r\naccept my brother's last proposals. If you will contrive that I have\r\nthe two thousand _Fredericks d'or_ today, I will leave the castle this\r\nvery night--on horseback--alone.\" \"With the money?\" asked V----. \"You\r\nare right,\" replied Hubert; \"I know what you would say--the weight!\r\nGive it me in bills on Isaac Lazarus of K----. For to K---- I am going\r\nthis very night. Something is driving me away from this place. The old\r\nfellow has bewitched it with evil spirits.\" \"Do you mean your father,\r\nHerr Baron?\" asked V---- sternly. Hubert's lips trembled; he had to\r\ncling to the chair to keep from falling; but then suddenly recovering\r\nhimself, he cried, \"To-day then, please, Herr Justitiarius,\" and\r\nstaggered to the door, not, however, without some exertion. \"He now\r\nsees that no deceptions are any longer of avail, that he can do nothing\r\nagainst my firm will,\" said the Freiherr whilst drawing up the bills on\r\nIsaac Lazarus in K----. A burden was lifted off his heart by the\r\ndeparture of his inimical brother; and for a long time he had not been\r\nin such cheerful spirits as he was at supper. Hubert had sent his\r\nexcuses; and there was not one who regretted his absence.\r\n\r\nThe room which V---- occupied was somewhat retired, and its windows\r\nlooked upon the castle-yard. In the night he was suddenly startled up\r\nout of his sleep, and was under the impression that he had been\r\nawakened by a distant and pitiable moan. But listen as he would, all\r\nremained still as the grave, and so he was obliged to conclude that the\r\nsound which had fallen upon his ears was the delusion of a dream. But\r\nat the same time he was seized with such a peculiar feeling of\r\nbreathless anxiety and terror that he could not stay in bed. He got up\r\nand approached the window. It was not long, however, before the castle\r\ndoor was opened, and a figure with a blazing torch came out of the\r\ncastle and went across the court-yard. V---- recognised the figure as\r\nthat of old Daniel, and saw him open the stable-door and go in, and\r\nsoon afterwards bring out a saddle horse. Now a second figure came into\r\nview out of the darkness, well wrapped in furs, and with a fox-skin cap\r\non his head. V---- perceived that it was Hubert; but after he had\r\nspoken excitedly with Daniel for some minutes, he returned into the\r\ncastle. Daniel led back the horse into the stable and locked the\r\ndoor, and also that of the castle, after he had returned across the\r\ncourt-yard in the same way in which he crossed it before. It was\r\nevident Hubert had intended to go away on horseback, but had suddenly\r\nchanged his mind; and no less evident was it that there was a dangerous\r\nunderstanding of some sort between Hubert and the old house-steward.\r\nV---- looked forward to the morning with burning impatience; he would\r\nacquaint the Freiherr with the occurrences of the night. Really it was\r\nnow time to take precautionary measures against the attacks of Hubert's\r\nmalice, which V---- was now convinced, had been betrayed in his\r\nagitated behaviour of the day before.\r\n\r\nNext morning, at the hour when the Freiherr was in the habit of rising,\r\nV---- heard people running backwards and forwards, doors opened and\r\nslammed to, and a tumultuous confusion of voices talking and shouting.\r\nOn going out of his room he met servants everywhere, who, without\r\nheeding him, ran past him with ghastly pale faces, upstairs,\r\ndownstairs, in and out the rooms. At length he ascertained that the\r\nFreiherr was missing, and that they had been looking for him for hours\r\nin vain. As he had gone to bed in the presence of his personal\r\nattendant, he must have afterwards got up and gone away somewhere in\r\nhis dressing-gown and slippers, taking the large candlestick with him,\r\nfor these articles were also missed. V----, his mind agitated with dark\r\nforebodings, ran up to the ill-fated hall, the cabinet adjoining which\r\nWolfgang had chosen, like his father, for his own bedroom. The postern\r\nleading to the tower stood wide open, with a cry of horror V----\r\nshouted, \"There--he lies dashed to pieces at the bottom of the ravine.\"\r\nAnd it was so. There had been a fall of snow, so that all they could\r\ndistinctly make out from above was the rigid arm of the unfortunate man\r\nprotruding from between the stones. Many hours passed before the\r\nworkmen succeeded, at great risk of life, in descending by means of\r\nladders bound together, and drawing up the corpse by the aid of ropes.\r\nIn the last agonies of death the Baron had kept a tight hold upon the\r\nsilver candlestick; the hand in which it was clenched was the only\r\nuninjured part of his whole body, which had been shattered in the most\r\nhideous way by rebounding on the sharp stones.\r\n\r\nJust as the corpse was drawn up and carried into the hall, and laid\r\nupon the very same spot on the large table where a few weeks before old\r\nRoderick had lain dead, Hubert burst in, his face distorted by the\r\nfrenzy of despair. Quite overpowered by the fearful sight he wailed,\r\n\"Brother! O my poor brother! No; this I never prayed for from the\r\ndemons who had entered into me.\" This suspicious self-exculpation made\r\nV---- tremble; he felt impelled to proceed against Hubert as the\r\nmurderer of his brother. Hubert, however, had fallen on the floor\r\nsenseless; they carried him to bed; but on taking strong restoratives\r\nhe soon recovered. Then he appeared in V----'s room, pale and\r\nsorrow-stricken, and with his eyes half clouded with grief; and unable\r\nto stand owing to his weakness, he slowly sank down into an easy-chair,\r\nsaying, \"I have wished for my brother's death, because my father had\r\nmade over to him the best part of the property through the foolish\r\nconversion of it into an entail. He has now found a fearful death. I am\r\nnow lord of the estate-tail, but my heart is rent with pain--I can--I\r\nshall never be happy. I confirm you in your office; you shall be\r\ninvested with the most extensive powers in respect to the management of\r\nthe estate, upon which I cannot bear to live.\" Hubert left the room,\r\nand in two or three hours was on his way to K----.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the unfortunate Wolfgang had got up in the night,\r\nprobably with the intention of going into the other cabinet where there\r\nwas a library. In the stupor of sleep he had mistaken the door, and had\r\nopened the postern, taken a step out, and plunged headlong down. But\r\nafter all had been said, there was nevertheless a good deal that was\r\nstrained and unlikely in this explanation. If the Baron was unable to\r\nsleep and wanted to get a book out of the library, this of itself\r\nexcluded all idea of sleep-stupor; but this condition alone could\r\naccount for any mistaking of the postern for the door of the cabinet.\r\nThen again, the former was fast locked, and required a good deal of\r\nexertion to unlock it. These improbabilities V---- accordingly put\r\nbefore the domestics, who had gathered round him, and at length the\r\nFreiherr's body-servant, Francis by name, said, \"Nay, nay, my good Herr\r\nJustitiarius; it couldn't have happened in that way.\" \"Well, how then?\"\r\nasked V---- abruptly and sharply. But Francis, a faithful, honest\r\nfellow, who would have followed his master into his grave, was\r\nunwilling to speak out before the rest; he stipulated that what he had\r\nto say about the event should be confided to the Justitiarius alone in\r\nprivate. V---- now learned that the Freiherr used often to talk to\r\nFrancis about the vast treasure which he believed lay buried beneath\r\nthe ruins of the tower, and also that frequently at night, as if goaded\r\nby some malicious fiend, he would open the postern, the key of which\r\nDaniel had been obliged to give him, and would gaze with longing eyes\r\ndown into the chasm where the supposed riches lay. There was now no\r\ndoubt about it; on that ill-omened night the Freiherr, after his\r\nservant had left him, must have taken one of his usual walks to the\r\npostern, where he had been most likely suddenly seized with dizziness,\r\nand had fallen over. Daniel, who also seemed much upset by the\r\nFreiherr's terrible end, thought it would be a good thing to have the\r\ndangerous postern walled up; and this was at once done.\r\n\r\nFreiherr Hubert von R----, who had then succeeded to the entail, went\r\nback to Courland without once showing himself at R--sitten again.\r\nV---- was invested with full powers for the absolute management of the\r\nproperty. The building of the new castle was not proceeded with; but\r\non the other hand the old structure was put in as good a state of\r\nrepair as possible. Several years passed before Hubert came again to\r\nR--sitten, late in the autumn, but after he had remained shut up in his\r\nroom with V---- for several days, he went back to Courland. Passing on\r\nhis way through K----, he deposited his will with the government\r\nauthorities there.\r\n\r\nThe Freiherr, whose character appeared to have undergone a complete\r\nrevolution, spoke more than once during his stay at R--sitten of\r\npresentiments of his approaching death. And these apprehensions were\r\nreally not unfounded, for he died in the very next year. His son,\r\nnamed, like the deceased Baron, Hubert, soon came over from Courland to\r\ntake possession of the rich inheritance; and was followed by his mother\r\nand his sister. The youth seemed to unite in his own person all the bad\r\nqualities of his ancestors: he proved himself to be proud, arrogant,\r\nimpetuous, avaricious, in the very first moments after his arrival at\r\nR--sitten. He wanted to have several things which did not suit his\r\nnotions of what was right and proper altered there and then: the cook\r\nhe kicked out of doors; and he attempted to thrash the coachman, in\r\nwhich, however, he did not succeed, for the big brawny fellow had the\r\nimpudence not to submit to it. In fact, he was on the high road to\r\nassuming the _rôle_ of a harsh and severe lord of the entail, when\r\nV---- interposed in his firm earnest manner, declaring most explicitly\r\nthat not a single chair should be moved, that not even a cat should\r\nleave the house if she liked to stay in it, until after the will had\r\nbeen opened. \"You have the presumption to tell me, the lord of the\r\nentail,\" began the Baron. V----, however, cut short the young man, who\r\nwas foaming with rage, and said, whilst he measured him with a keen\r\nsearching glance, \"Don't be in too great a hurry, Herr Baron. At all\r\nevents, you have no right to exercise authority here until after the\r\nopening of your father's will. It is I--I alone--who am now master\r\nhere; and I shall know how to meet violence with violent measures.\r\nPlease to recollect that by virtue of my powers as executor of your\r\nfather's will, as well as by virtue of the arrangements which have been\r\nmade by the court, I am empowered to forbid your remaining in R--sitten\r\nif I think fit to do so; and so, if you wish to spare me this\r\ndisagreeable step, I would advise you to go away quietly to K----.\" The\r\nlawyer's earnestness, and the resolute tone in which he spoke, lent the\r\nproper emphasis to his words. Hence the young Baron, who was charging\r\nwith far two sharp-pointed horns, felt the weakness of his weapons\r\nagainst the firm bulwark, and found it convenient to cover the shame of\r\nhis retreat with a burst of scornful laughter.\r\n\r\nThree months passed and the day was come on which, in accordance with\r\nthe expressed wish of the deceased, his will was to be opened at K----,\r\nwhere it had been deposited. In the chambers there was, besides the\r\nofficers of the court, the Baron, and V----, a young man of noble\r\nappearance, whom V---- had brought with him, and who was taken to be\r\nV----'s clerk, since he had a parchment deed sticking out from the\r\nbreast of his buttoned-up coat. Him the Baron treated as he did nearly\r\nall the rest, with scornful contempt; and he demanded with noisy\r\nimpetuosity that they should make haste and get done with all their\r\ntiresome needless ceremonies as quickly as possible and without over\r\nmany words and scribblings. He couldn't for the life of him make out\r\nwhy any will should be wanted at all with respect to the inheritance,\r\nand especially in the case of entailed property; and no matter what\r\nprovisions were made in the will, it would depend entirely upon his\r\ndecision as to whether they should be observed or not. After casting a\r\nhasty and surly glance at the handwriting and the seal, the Baron\r\nacknowledged them to be those of his dead father. Upon the clerk of the\r\ncourt preparing to read the will aloud, the young Baron, throwing his\r\nright arm carelessly over the back of his chair and leaning his left on\r\nthe table, whilst he drummed with his fingers on its green cover, sat\r\nstaring with an air of indifference out of the window. After a short\r\npreamble the deceased Freiherr Hubert von R---- declared that he had\r\nnever possessed the estate-tail as its lawful owner, but that he had\r\nonly managed it in the name of the deceased Freiherr Wolfgang von\r\nR----'s only son, called Roderick after his grandfather; and he it was\r\nto whom, according to the rights of family priority, the estate had\r\nfallen on his father's death. Amongst Hubert's papers would be found an\r\nexact account of all revenues and expenditure, as well as of existing\r\nmovable property, &c. The will went on to relate that Wolfgang von\r\nR---- had, during his travels, made the acquaintance of Mdlle. Julia de\r\nSt. Val in Geneva, and had fallen so deeply in love with her that he\r\nresolved never to leave her side again. She was very poor; and her\r\nfamily, although noble and of good repute, did not, however, rank\r\namongst the most illustrious, for which reason Wolfgang dared not\r\nexpect to receive the consent of old Roderick to a union with her, for\r\nthe old Freiherr's aim and ambition was to promote by all possible\r\nmeans the establishment of a powerful family. Nevertheless he ventured\r\nto write from Paris to his father, acquainting him with the fact that\r\nhis affections were engaged. But what he had foreseen was actually\r\nrealised; the old Baron declared categorically that he had himself\r\nchosen the future mistress of the entail, and therefore there could\r\nnever be any mention made of any other. Wolfgang, instead of crossing\r\nthe Channel into England, as he was to have done, returned into Geneva\r\nunder the assumed name of Born, and married Julia, who after the lapse\r\nof a year bore him a son, and this son became on Wolfgang's death the\r\nreal lord of the entail. In explanation of the facts why Hubert, though\r\nacquainted with all this, had kept silent so long and had represented\r\nhimself as lord of the entail, various reasons were assigned, based\r\nupon agreements formerly made with Wolfgang, but they seemed for the\r\nmost part insufficient and devoid of real foundation.\r\n\r\nThe Baron sat staring at the clerk of the court as if thunderstruck,\r\nwhilst the latter went on proclaiming all this bad news in a\r\nprovokingly monotonous and jarring tone. When he finished, V---- rose,\r\nand taking the young man whom he had brought with him by the hand,\r\nsaid, as he bowed to the assembled company, \"Here I have the honour to\r\npresent to you, gentlemen, Freiherr Roderick von R----, lord of the\r\nentail of R--sitten.\" Baron Hubert looked at the youth, who had, as it\r\nwere, fallen from the clouds to deprive him of the rich inheritance\r\ntogether with half the unentailed Courland estates, with suppressed\r\nfury in his gleaming eyes; then, threatening him with his doubled fist,\r\nhe ran out of the court without uttering a word. Baron Roderick, on\r\nbeing challenged by the court-officers, produced the documents by which\r\nhe was to establish his identity as the person whom he represented\r\nhimself to be. He handed in an attested extract from the register of\r\nthe church where his father was married, which certified that on such\r\nand such a day Wolfgang Born, merchant, born in K----, had been united\r\nin marriage with the blessing of the Church to Mdlle. Julia de St. Val,\r\nin the presence of certain witnesses, who were named. Further, he\r\nproduced his own baptismal certificate (he had been baptized in Geneva\r\nas the son of the merchant Born and his wife Julia, _née_ De St. Val,\r\nbegotten in lawful wedlock), and various letters from his father to his\r\nmother, who was long since dead, but they none of them had any other\r\nsignature than W.\r\n\r\nV---- looked through all these papers with a cloud upon his face; and\r\nas he put them together again, he said, somewhat troubled, \"Ah well!\r\nGod will help us!\"\r\n\r\nThe very next morning Freiherr Hubert von R---- presented, through an\r\nadvocate whose services he had succeeded in enlisting in his cause, a\r\nstatement of protest to the government authorities in K----, actually\r\ncalling upon them to effectuate the immediate surrender to him of the\r\nentail of R--sitten. It was incontestable, maintained the advocate,\r\nthat the deceased Freiherr Hubert Von R---- had not had the power to\r\ndispose of entailed property either by testament or in any other way.\r\nThe testament in question, therefore, was nothing more than an\r\nevidential statement, written down and deposited with the court, to the\r\neffect that Freiherr Wolfgang von R---- had bequeathed the estate-tail\r\nto a son who was at that time still living; and accordingly it had as\r\nevidence no greater weight than that of any other witness, and so could\r\nnot by any possibility legitimately establish the claims of the person\r\nwho had announced himself to be Freiherr Roderick von R----. Hence it\r\nwas rather the duty of this new claimant to prove by action at law his\r\nalleged rights of inheritance, which were hereby expressly disputed and\r\ndenied, and so also to take proper steps to maintain his claim to the\r\nestate-tail, which now, according to the laws of succession, fell to\r\nBaron Hubert von R----. By the father's death the property came at once\r\nimmediately into the hands of the son. There was no need for any\r\nformal declaration to be made of his entering into possession of the\r\ninheritance, since the succession could not be alienated; at any rate,\r\nthe present owner of the estate was not going to be disturbed in his\r\npossession by claims which were perfectly groundless. Whatever reasons\r\nthe deceased might have had for bringing forward another heir of entail\r\nwere quite irrelevant. And it might be remarked that he had himself had\r\nan intrigue in Switzerland, as could be proved if necessary from the\r\npapers he had left behind him; and it was quite possible that the\r\nperson whom he alleged to be his brother's son was his own son, the\r\nfruit of an unlawful love, for whom in a momentary fit of remorse he\r\nhad wished to secure the entail.\r\n\r\nHowever great was the balance of probability in favour of the truth of\r\nthe circumstances as stated in the will, and however revolted the\r\njudges were, particularly by the last clauses of the protest, in which\r\nthe son felt no compunction at accusing his dead father of a crime, yet\r\nthe views of the case there stated were after all the right ones; and\r\nit was only due to V----'s restless exertions, and his explicit and\r\nsolemn assurance that the proofs which were necessary to establish\r\nlegitimately the identity of Freiherr Roderick von R---- should be\r\nproduced in a very short time, that the surrender of the estate to the\r\nyoung Baron was deferred, and the contrivance of the administration of\r\nit in trust agreed to, until after the case should be settled.\r\n\r\nV---- was only too well aware how difficult it would be for him to keep\r\nhis promise. He had turned over all old Roderick's papers without\r\nfinding the slightest trace of a letter or any kind of a statement\r\nbearing upon Wolfgang's relation to Mdlle. de St. Val. He was sitting\r\nwrapt in thought in old Roderick's sleeping-cabinet, every hole and\r\ncomer of which he had searched, and was working at a long statement of\r\nthe case that he intended despatching to a certain notary in Geneva,\r\nwho had been recommended to him as a shrewd and energetic man, to\r\nrequest him to procure and forward certain documents which would\r\nestablish the young Freiherr's cause on firm ground. It was midnight;\r\nthe full moon shone in through the windows of the adjoining hall, the\r\ndoor of which stood open. Then V---- fancied he heard a noise as of\r\nsome one coming slowly and heavily up the stairs, and also at the same\r\ntime a jingling and rattling of keys. His attention was arrested; he\r\nrose to his feet and went into the hall, where he plainly made out that\r\nthere was some one crossing the ante-room and approaching the door of\r\nthe hall where he was. Soon afterwards the door was opened and a man\r\ncame slowly in, dressed in night-clothes, his face ghastly pale and\r\ndistorted; in the one hand he bore a candle-stick with the candles\r\nburning, and in the other a huge bunch of keys. V---- at once\r\nrecognised the house-steward, and was on the point of addressing him\r\nand inquiring what he wanted so late at night, when he was arrested by\r\nan icy shiver; there was something so unearthly and ghost-like in the\r\nold man's manner and bearing as well as in his set, pallid face. He\r\nperceived that he was in presence of a somnambulist. Crossing the hall\r\nobliquely with measured strides, the old man went straight to the\r\nwalled-up postern that had formerly led to the tower. He came to a halt\r\nimmediately in front of it, and uttered a wailing sound that seemed to\r\ncome from the bottom of his heart, and was so awful and so loud that\r\nthe whole apartment rang again, making V---- tremble with dread. Then,\r\nsetting the candlestick down on the floor and hanging the keys on his\r\nbelt, Daniel began to scratch at the wall with both hands, so that the\r\nblood soon burst out from beneath his finger-nails, and all the while\r\nhe was moaning and groaning as if tortured by nameless agony. After\r\nplacing his ear against the wall in a listening attitude, he waved his\r\nhand as if hushing some one, stooped down and picked up the\r\ncandlestick, and finally stole back to the door with soft measured\r\nfootsteps. V---- took his own candle in his hand and cautiously\r\nfollowed him. They both went downstairs; the old man unlocked the great\r\nmain door of the castle, V---- slipped cleverly through. Then they went\r\nto the stable, where old Daniel, to V----'s perfect astonishment,\r\nplaced his candlestick so skilfully that the entire interior of the\r\nbuilding was sufficiently lighted without the least danger. Having\r\nfetched a saddle and bridle, he put them on one of the horses which he\r\nhad loosed from the manger, carefully tightening the girth and taking\r\nup the stirrup-straps. Pulling the tuft of hair on the horse's forehead\r\noutside the front strap, he took him by the bridle and led him out of\r\nthe stable, clicking with his tongue and patting his neck with one\r\nhand. On getting outside in the courtyard he stood several seconds in\r\nthe attitude of one receiving commands, which he promised by sundry\r\nnods to carry out. Then he led the horse back into the stable,\r\nunsaddled him, and tied him to the manger. This done, he took his\r\ncandlestick, locked the stable, and returned to the castle, finally\r\ndisappearing in his own room, the door of which he carefully bolted.\r\nV---- was deeply agitated by this scene; the presentiment of some\r\nfearful deed rose up before him like a black and fiendish spectre, and\r\nrefused to leave him. Being so keenly alive as he was to the precarious\r\nposition of his _protégé_, he felt that it would at least be his duty\r\nto turn what he had seen to his account.\r\n\r\nNext day, just as it was beginning to be dusk, Daniel came into the\r\nJustitiarius's room to receive some instructions relating to his\r\ndepartment of the household. V---- took him by the arms, and forcing\r\nhim into a chair, in a confidential way began, \"See you here, my old\r\nfriend Daniel, I have long been wishing to ask you what you think of\r\nall this confused mess into which Hubert's peculiar will has tumbled\r\nus. Do you really think that the young man is Wolfgang's son, begotten\r\nin lawful marriage?\" The old man, leaning over the arm of his chair,\r\nand avoiding V----'s eyes, for V---- was watching him most intently,\r\nreplied doggedly, \"Bah! Maybe he is; maybe he is not. What does it\r\nmatter to me? It's all the same to me who's master here now.\" \"But I\r\nbelieve,\" went on V----, moving nearer to the old man and placing his\r\nhand on his shoulder, \"but I believed you possessed the old Freiherr's\r\nfull confidence, and in that case he assuredly would not conceal from\r\nyou the real state of affairs with regard to his sons. He told you, I\r\ndare say, about the marriage which Wolfgang had made against his will,\r\ndid he not?\" \"I don't remember to have ever heard him say anything of\r\nthat sort,\" replied the old man, yawning with the most ill-mannered\r\nloudness. \"You are sleepy, old man,\" said V----; \"perhaps you have had\r\na restless night?\" \"Not that I am aware,\" he rejoined coldly; \"but I\r\nmust go and order supper.\" Whereupon he rose heavily from his chair and\r\nrubbed his bent back, yawning again, and that still more loudly than\r\nbefore. \"Stay a little while, old man,\" cried V----, taking hold of his\r\nhand and endeavouring to force him to resume his seat; but Daniel\r\npreferred to stand in front of the study-table; propping himself upon\r\nit with both hands, and leaning across towards V----, he asked\r\nsullenly, \"Well, what do you want? What have I to do with the will?\r\nWhat do I care about the quarrel over the estate?\" \"Well, well,\"\r\ninterposed V----, \"we'll say no more about that now. Let us turn to\r\nsome other topic, Daniel. You are out of humour and yawning, and all\r\nthat is a sign of great weariness, and I am almost inclined to believe\r\nthat it really was _you_ last night, who\"---- \"Well, what did I do last\r\nnight?\" asked the old man without changing his position. V---- went\r\non, \"Last night, when I was sitting up above in your old master's\r\nsleeping-cabinet next the great hall, you came in at the door, your\r\nface pale and rigid; and you went across to the bricked-up postern and\r\nscratched at the wall with both your hands, groaning as if in very\r\ngreat pain. Do you walk in your sleep, Daniel?\" The old man dropped\r\nback into the chair which V---- quickly managed to place for him; but\r\nnot a sound escaped his lips. His face could not be seen, owing to the\r\ngathering dusk of the evening; V---- only noticed that he took his\r\nbreath short and that his teeth were rattling together. \"Yes,\"\r\n continued V---- after a short pause, \"there is one thing that is very\r\nstrange about sleep-walkers. On the day after they have been in this\r\npeculiar state in which they have acted as if they were perfectly wide\r\nawake, they don't remember the least thing, that they did.\" Daniel did\r\nnot move. \"I have come across something like what your condition was\r\nyesterday once before in the course of my experience,\" proceeded V----.\r\n\"I had a friend who regularly began to wander about at night as you do\r\nwhenever it was full moon,--nay, he often sat down and wrote letters.\r\nBut what was most extraordinary was that if I began to whisper softly\r\nin his ear I could soon manage to make him speak; and he would answer\r\ncorrectly all the questions I put to him; and even things that he would\r\nmost jealously have concealed when awake now fell from his lips\r\nunbidden, as though he were unable to offer any resistance to the power\r\nthat was exerting its influence over him. Deuce take it! I really\r\nbelieve that, if a man who's given to walking in his sleep had ever\r\ncommitted any crime, and hoarded it up as a secret ever so long, it\r\ncould be extracted from him by questioning when he was in this peculiar\r\nstate. Happy are they who have a clean conscience like you and me,\r\nDaniel! We may walk as much as we like in our sleep; there's no fear of\r\nanybody extorting the confession of a crime from us. But come now,\r\nDaniel! when you scratch so hideously at the bricked-up postern, you\r\nwant, I dare say, to go up the astronomical tower, don't you? I suppose\r\nyou want to go and experiment like old Roderick--eh? Well, next time\r\nyou come, I shall ask you what you want to do.\" Whilst V---- was\r\nspeaking, the old man was shaken with continually increasing agitation;\r\nbut now his whole frame seemed to heave and rock convulsively past all\r\nhope of cure, and in a shrill voice he began to utter a string of\r\nunmeaning gibberish. V---- rang for the servants. They brought lights;\r\nbut as the old man's fit did not abate, they lifted him up as though he\r\nhad been a mere automaton, not possessed of the power of voluntary\r\nmovement, and carried him to bed. After continuing in this frightful\r\nstate for about an hour, he fell into a profound sleep resembling a\r\ndead faint When he awoke he asked for wine; and, after he had got what\r\nhe wanted, he sent away the man who was going to sit with him, and\r\nlocked himself in his room as usual.\r\n\r\nV---- had indeed really resolved to make the attempt he spoke of to\r\nDaniel, although at the same time he could not forget two facts. In the\r\nfirst place, Daniel, having now been made aware of his propensity to\r\nwalk in his sleep, would probably adopt every measure of precaution to\r\navoid him; and on the other hand, confessions made whilst in this\r\ncondition would not be exactly fitted to serve as a basis for further\r\nproceedings. In spite of this, however, he repaired to the hall on the\r\napproach of midnight, hoping that Daniel, as frequently happens to\r\nthose afflicted in this way, would be constrained to act involuntarily.\r\nAbout midnight there arose a great noise in the courtyard. V----\r\nplainly heard a window broken in; then he went downstairs, and as he\r\ntraversed the passages he was met by rolling clouds of suffocating\r\nsmoke, which, he soon perceived were pouring out of the open door of\r\nthe house-steward's room. The steward himself was just being carried\r\nout, to all appearance dead, in order to be taken and put to bed in\r\nanother room. The servants related that about midnight one of the\r\nunder-grooms had been awakened by a strange hollow knocking; he thought\r\nsomething had befallen the old man, and was preparing to get up and go\r\nand see if he could help him, when the night watchman in the court\r\nshouted, \"Fire! Fire! The Herr House-Steward's room is all of a bright\r\nblaze!\" At this outcry several servants at once appeared on the scene;\r\nbut all their efforts to burst open the room door were unavailing.\r\nWhereupon they hurried out into the court, but the resolute watchman\r\nhad already broken in the window, for the room was low and on the\r\nbasement story, had torn down the burning curtains, and by pouring a\r\nfew buckets of water on them had at once extinguished the fire. The\r\nhouse-steward they found lying on the floor in the middle of the room\r\nin a swoon. In his hand he still held the candlestick tightly clenched,\r\nthe burning candles of which had caught the curtains, and so occasioned\r\nthe fire. Some of the blazing rags had fallen upon the old man, burning\r\nhis eyebrows and a large portion of the hair of his head. If the\r\nwatchman had not seen the fire the old man must have been helplessly\r\nburned to death. The servants, moreover, to their no little\r\nastonishment found the room door secured on the inside by two quite new\r\nbolts, which had been fastened on since the previous evening, for they\r\nhad not been there then. V---- perceived that the old man had wished to\r\nmake it impossible for him to get out of his room; for the blind\r\nimpulse which urged him to wander in his sleep he could not resist. The\r\nold man became seriously ill; he did not speak; he took but little\r\nnourishment; and lay staring before him with the reflection of death in\r\nhis set eyes, just as if he were clasped in the vice-like grip of some\r\nhideous thought. V---- believed he would never rise from his bed again.\r\n\r\nV---- had done all that could be done for his client; and he could now\r\nonly await the result in patience; and so he resolved to return to\r\nK----. His departure was fixed for the following morning. As he was\r\npacking his papers together late at night, he happened to lay his hand\r\nupon a little sealed packet which Freiherr Hubert von R---- had given\r\nhim, bearing the inscription, \"To be read after my will has been\r\nopened,\" and which by some unaccountable means had hitherto escaped his\r\nnotice. He was on the point of breaking the seal when the door opened\r\nand Daniel came in with still, ghostlike step. Placing upon the table a\r\nblack portfolio which he carried under his arm, he sank upon his knees\r\nwith a deep groan, and grasping V----'s hands with a convulsive clutch\r\nhe said, in a voice so hollow and hoarse that it seemed to come from\r\nthe bottom of a grave, \"I should not like to die on the scaffold! There\r\nis One above who judges!\" Then, rising with some trouble and with many\r\npainful gasps, he left the room as he had come.\r\n\r\nV---- spent the whole of the night in reading what the black portfolio\r\nand Hubert's packet contained. Both agreed in all circumstantial\r\nparticulars, and suggested naturally what further steps were to be\r\ntaken. On arriving at K----, V---- immediately repaired to Freiherr\r\nHubert von R----, who received him with ill-mannered pride. But the\r\nremarkable result of the interview, which began at noon and lasted on\r\nwithout interruption until late at night, was that the next day the\r\nFreiherr made a declaration before the court to the effect that he\r\nacknowledged the claimant to be, agreeably to his father's will, the\r\nson of Wolfgang von R----, eldest son of Freiherr Roderick von R----,\r\nand begotten in lawful wedlock with Mdlle. Julia de St. Val, and\r\nfurthermore acknowledged him as rightful and legitimate heir to the\r\nentail. On leaving the court he found his carriage, with post-horses,\r\nstanding before the door; he stepped in and was driven off at a rapid\r\nrate, leaving his mother and his sister behind him. They would perhaps\r\nnever see him again, he wrote, along with other perplexing statements.\r\nRoderick's astonishment at this unexpected turn which the case had\r\ntaken was very great; he pressed V---- to explain to him how this\r\nwonder had been brought about, what mysterious power was at work in the\r\nmatter. V----, however, evaded his questions by giving him hopes of\r\ntelling him all at some future time, and when he should have come into\r\npossession of the estate. For the surrender of the entail to him could\r\nnot be effected immediately, since the court, not content with Hubert's\r\ndeclaration, required that Roderick should also first prove his own\r\nidentity to their satisfaction. V---- proposed to the Baron that he\r\nshould go and live at R--sitten, adding that Hubert's mother and\r\nsister, momentarily embarrassed by his sudden departure, would prefer\r\nto go and live quietly on the ancestral property rather than stay in\r\nthe dear and noisy town. The glad delight with which Roderick welcomed\r\nthe prospect of dwelling, at least for a time, under the same roof with\r\nthe Baroness and her daughter, betrayed the deep impression which the\r\nlovely and graceful Seraphina had made upon him. In fact, the Freiherr\r\nmade such good use of his time in R--sitten that, at the end of a few\r\nweeks, he had won Seraphina's love as well as her mother's cordial\r\napproval of her marriage with him. All this was for V---- rather too\r\nquick work, since Roderick's claims to be lord of the entail still\r\ncontinued to be rather doubtful. The life of idyllic happiness at the\r\ncastle was interrupted by letters from Courland. Hubert had not shown\r\nhimself at all at the estates, but had travelled direct to St\r\nPetersburg, where he had taken military service and was now in the\r\nfield against the Persians, with whom Russia happened to be just then\r\nwaging war. This obliged the Baroness and her daughter to set off\r\nimmediately for their Courland estates, where everything was in\r\nconfusion and disorder. Roderick, who regarded himself in the light of\r\nan accepted son-in-law, insisted upon accompanying his beloved; and\r\nhence, since V---- likewise returned to K----, the castle was left in\r\nits previous loneliness. The house-steward's malignant complaint grew\r\nworse and worse, so that he gave up all hopes of ever getting about\r\nagain; and his office was conferred upon an old _chasseur_, Francis by\r\nname, Wolfgang's faithful servant.\r\n\r\nAt last, after long waiting, V---- received from Switzerland\r\ninformation of the most favourable character. The priest who had\r\nmarried Roderick was long since dead; but there was found in the church\r\nregister a memorandum in his hand writing, to the effect that the man\r\nof the name of Born, whom he had joined in the bonds of wedlock with\r\nMdlle. Julia de St. Val, had established completely to his satisfaction\r\nhis identity as Freiherr Wolfgang von R----, eldest son of Freiherr\r\nRoderick von R---- of R--Sitten. Besides this, two witnesses of the\r\nmarriage had been discovered, a merchant of Geneva and an old French\r\ncaptain, who had moved to Lyons; to them also Wolfgang had in\r\nconfidence stated his real name; and their affidavits confirmed the\r\npriest's notice in the church register. With these memoranda in his\r\nhands, drawn up with proper legal formalities, V---- now succeeded in\r\nsecuring his client in the complete possession of his rights; and as\r\nthere was now no longer any hindrance to the surrender to him of the\r\nentail, it was to be put into his hands in the ensuing autumn. Hubert\r\nhad fallen in his very first engagement, thus sharing the fate of his\r\nyounger brother, who had likewise been slain in battle a year before\r\nhis father's death. Thus the Courland estates fell to Baroness\r\nSeraphina von R----, and made a handsome dowry for her to take to the\r\ntoo happy Roderick.\r\n\r\nNovember had already come in when the Baroness, along with Roderick and\r\nhis betrothed, arrived at R--sitten. The formal surrender of the\r\nestate-tail to the young Baron took place, and then his marriage with\r\nSeraphina was solemnised. Many weeks passed amid a continual whirl of\r\npleasure; but at length the wearied guests began gradually to depart\r\nfrom the castle, to V----'s great satisfaction, for he had made up his\r\nmind not to take his leave of R--sitten until he had initiated the\r\nyoung lord of the entail in all the relations and duties connected with\r\nhis new position down to the minutest particulars. Roderick's uncle had\r\nkept an account of all revenues and disbursements with the most\r\ndetailed accuracy; hence, since Hubert had only retained a small sum\r\nannually for his own support, the surplus revenues had all gone to\r\nswell the capital left by the old Freiherr, till the total now amounted\r\nto a considerable sum. Hubert had only employed the income of the\r\nentail for his own purposes during the first three years, but to cover\r\nthis he had given a mortgage on the security of his share of the\r\nCourland property.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when old Daniel had revealed himself to V---- as a\r\nsomnambulist, V---- had chosen old Roderick's bed-room for his own\r\nsitting-room, in order that he might the more securely gather from the\r\nold man what he afterwards voluntarily disclosed. Hence it was in this\r\nroom and in the adjoining great hall that the Freiherr transacted\r\nbusiness with V----. Once they were both sitting at the great table by\r\nthe bright blazing fire; V---- had his pen in his hand, and was noting\r\ndown various totals and calculating the riches of the lord of the\r\nentail, whilst the latter, leaning his head on his hand, was blinking\r\nat the open account-books and formidable-looking documents. Neither of\r\nthem heard the hollow roar of the sea, nor the anxious cries of the\r\nsea-gulls as they dashed against the windowpanes, flapping their wings\r\nand flying backwards and forwards, announcing the oncoming storm.\r\nNeither of them heeded the storm, which arose about midnight, and was\r\nnow roaring and raging with wild fury round the castle walls, so that\r\nall the sounds of ill omen in the fire-grates and narrow passages\r\nawoke, and began to whistle and shriek in a weird, unearthly way. At\r\nlength, after a terrific blast, which made the whole castle shake, the\r\nhall was completely lit up by the murky glare of the full moon, and\r\nV---- exclaimed, \"Awful weather!\" The Freiherr, quite absorbed in the\r\nconsideration of the wealth which had fallen to him, replied\r\nindifferently, as he turned over a page of the receipt-book with a\r\nsatisfied smile, \"It is indeed; very stormy!\" But, as if clutched by\r\nthe icy hand of Dread, he started to his feet as the door of the hall\r\nflew open and a pale spectral figure became visible, striding in with\r\nthe stamp of death upon its face. It was Daniel, who, lying helpless\r\nunder the power of disease, was deemed in the opinion of V---- as of\r\neverybody else incapable of the ability to move a single limb; but,\r\nagain coming under the influence of his propensity to wander in his\r\nsleep at full moon, he had, it appeared, been unable to resist it. The\r\nFreiherr stared at the old man without uttering a sound; and when\r\nDaniel began to scratch at the wall, and moan as though in the painful\r\nagonies of death, Roderick's heart was filled with horrible dread. With\r\nhis face ashy pale and his hair standing straight on end, he leapt to\r\nhis feet and strode towards the old man in a threatening attitude and\r\ncried in a loud firm voice, so that the hall rang again, \"Daniel,\r\nDaniel, what are you doing here at this hour?\" Then the old man uttered\r\nthat same unearthly howling whimper, like the death-cry of a wounded\r\nanimal, which he had uttered when Wolfgang had offered to reward his\r\nfidelity with gold; and he fell down on the floor. V---- summoned the\r\nservants; they raised the old man up; but all attempts to restore\r\nanimation proved fruitless. Then the Freiherr cried, almost beside\r\nhimself, \"Good God! Good God! Now I remember to have heard that a\r\nsleepwalker may die on the spot if anybody calls him by his name. Oh!\r\noh! unfortunate wretch that I am! I have killed the poor old man! I\r\nshall never more have a peaceful moment so long as I live.\" When the\r\nservants had carried the corpse away and the hall was again empty,\r\nV---- took the Freiherr, who was still continuing his self-reproaches,\r\nby the hand and led him in impressive silence to the walled-up postern,\r\nand said, \"The man who fell down dead at your feet, Freiherr Roderick,\r\nwas the atrocious murderer of your father.\" The Freiherr fixed his\r\nstaring eyes upon V---- as though he saw the foul fiends of hell. But\r\nV---- went on, \"The time has come now for me to reveal to you the\r\nhideous secret which, weighing upon the conscience of this monster and\r\nburthening him with curses, compelled him to roam abroad in his sleep.\r\nThe Eternal Power has seen fit to make the son take vengeance upon the\r\nmurderer of his father. The words which you thundered in the ears of\r\nthat fearful night-walker were the last words which your unhappy father\r\nspoke.\" V---- sat down in front of the fire, and the Freiherr,\r\ntrembling and unable to utter a word, took his seat beside him.\r\nV---- began to tell him the contents of the document which Hubert had\r\nleft behind him, and the seal of which he (V----) was not to break\r\nuntil after the opening of the will Hubert lamented, in expressions\r\ntestifying to the deepest remorse, the implacable hatred against his\r\nelder brother which took root in him from the moment that old Roderick\r\nestablished the entail. He was deprived of all weapons; for, even if he\r\nsucceeded in maliciously setting the son at variance with the father,\r\nit would serve no purpose, since even Roderick himself had not the\r\npower to deprive his eldest son of his birth-right, nor would he on\r\nprinciple have ever done so, no matter how his affections had been\r\nalienated from him. It was only when Wolfgang formed his connection\r\nwith Julia de St. Val in Geneva that Hubert saw his way to effecting\r\nhis brother's ruin. And that was the time when he came to an\r\nunderstanding with Daniel, to provoke the old man by villainous devices\r\nto take measures which should drive his son to despair.\r\n\r\nHe was well aware of old Roderick's opinion that the only way to ensure\r\nan illustrious future for the family to all subsequent time was by\r\nmeans of an alliance with one of the oldest families in the country.\r\nThe old man had read this alliance in the stars, and any pernicious\r\nderangement of the constellation would only entail destruction upon the\r\nfamily he had founded. In this way it was that Wolfgang's union with\r\nJulia seemed to the old man like a sinful crime, committed against the\r\nordinances of the Power which had stood by him in all his worldly\r\nundertakings; and any means that might be employed for Julia's ruin he\r\nwould have regarded as justified for the same reason, for Julia had, he\r\nconceived, ranged herself against him like some demoniacal principle.\r\nHubert knew that his brother loved Julia passionately, almost to\r\nmadness in fact, and that the loss of her would infallibly make him\r\nmiserable, perhaps kill him. And Hubert was all the more ready to\r\nassist the old man in his plans as he had himself conceived an unlawful\r\naffection for Julia, and hoped to win her for himself. It was, however,\r\ndetermined by a special dispensation of Providence that all attacks,\r\neven the most virulent, were to be thwarted by Wolfgang's resoluteness;\r\nnay, that he should contrive to deceive his brother: the fact that his\r\nmarriage was actually solemnised and that of the birth of a son were\r\nkept secret from Hubert In Roderick's mind also there occurred, along\r\nwith the presentiment of his approaching death, the idea that Wolfgang\r\nhad really married the Julia who was so hostile to him. In the letter\r\nwhich commanded his son to appear at R--sitten on a given day to take\r\npossession of the entail, he cursed him if he did not sever his\r\nconnection with her. This was the letter that Wolfgang burnt beside his\r\nfather's corpse. To Hubert the old man wrote, saying that Wolfgang had\r\nmarried Julia, but that he would part from her. This Hubert took to be\r\na fancy of his visionary father's; accordingly he was not a little\r\ndismayed when on reaching R--sitten Wolfgang with perfect frankness not\r\nonly confirmed the old man's supposition, but also went on to add that\r\nJulia had borne him a son, and that he hoped in a short time to\r\nsurprise her with the pleasant intelligence of his high rank and great\r\nwealth, for she had hitherto taken him for Born, a merchant from M----.\r\nHe intended going to Geneva himself to fetch his beloved wife. But\r\nbefore he could carry out this plan he was overtaken by death. Hubert\r\ncarefully concealed what he knew about the existence of a son born to\r\nWolfgang in lawful wedlock with Julia, and so usurped the property that\r\nreally belonged to his nephew. But only a few years passed before he\r\nbecame a prey to bitter remorse. He was reminded of his guilt in\r\nterrible wise by destiny, in the hatred which grew up and developed\r\nmore and more between his two sons. \"You are a poor starving beggar!\"\r\nsaid the elder, a boy of twelve, to the younger, \"but I shall be lord\r\nof R--sitten when father dies, and then you will have to be humble and\r\nkiss my hand when you want me to give you money to buy a new coat.\" The\r\nyounger, goaded to ungovernable fury by his brother's proud and\r\nscornful words, threw the knife at him which he happened to have in his\r\nhand, and almost killed him. Hubert, for fear of some dire misfortune,\r\nsent the younger away to St. Petersburg; and he served afterwards as\r\nofficer under Suwaroff, and fell fighting against the French. Hubert\r\nwas prevented revealing to the world the dishonest and deceitful way in\r\nwhich he had acquired possession of the estate-tail by the shame and\r\ndisgrace which would have come upon him; but he would not rob the\r\nrightful owner of a single penny more. He caused inquiries to be set on\r\nfoot in Geneva, and learned that Madame Born had died of grief at the\r\nincomprehensible disappearance of her husband, but that young Roderick\r\nBorn was being brought up by a worthy man who had adopted him. Hubert\r\nthen caused himself to be introduced under an assumed name as a\r\nrelative of Born the merchant, who had perished at sea, and he\r\nforwarded at given times sufficient sums of money to give the young\r\nheir of entail a good and respectable education. How he carefully\r\ntreasured up the surplus revenues from the estate, and how he drew up\r\nthe terms of his will, we already know. Respecting his brother's death,\r\nHubert spoke in strangely obscure terms, but they allowed this much to\r\nbe inferred, that there must be some mystery about it, and that he had\r\ntaken part, indirectly, at least, in some heinous crime.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the black portfolio made everything clear. Along with\r\nHubert's traitorous correspondence with Daniel was a sheet of paper\r\nwritten and signed by Daniel. V---- read a confession at which his very\r\nsoul trembled, appalled. It was at Daniel's instigation that Hubert had\r\ncome to R--sitten; and it was Daniel again who had written and told him\r\nabout the one hundred and fifty thousand thalers that had been found.\r\nIt has been already described how Hubert was received by his brother,\r\nand how, deceived in all his hopes and wishes, he was about to go off\r\nwhen he was prevented by V----, Daniel's heart was tortured by an\r\ninsatiable thirst for vengeance, which he was determined to take on the\r\nyoung man who had proposed to kick him out like a mangy cur. He it was\r\nwho relentlessly and incessantly fanned the flame of passion by which\r\nHubert's desperate heart was consumed. Whilst in the fir forests\r\nhunting wolves, out in the midst of a blinding snowstorm, they agreed\r\nto effect his destruction. \"Make away with him!\" murmured Hubert,\r\nlooking askance and taking aim with his rifle. \"Yes, make away with\r\nhim,\" snarled Daniel, \"but not in _that way_, not in _that way!_\" And\r\nhe made the most solemn asseverations that he would murder the Freiherr\r\nand not a soul in the world should be the wiser. When, however, Hubert\r\nhad got his money, he repented of the plot; he determined to go away in\r\norder to shun all further temptation. Daniel himself saddled his horse\r\nand brought it out of the stable; but as the Baron was about to mount,\r\nDaniel said to him in a sharp, strained voice, \"I thought you would\r\nstay on the entail, Freiherr Hubert, now that it has just fallen to\r\nyou, for the proud lord of the entail lies dashed to pieces at the\r\nbottom of the ravine, below the tower.\" The steward had observed that\r\nWolfgang, tormented by his thirst for gold, often used to rise in the\r\nnight, go to the postern which formerly led to the tower, and stand\r\ngazing with longing eyes down into the chasm, where, according to his\r\n(Daniel's) testimony, vast treasures lay buried. Relying upon this\r\nhabit, Daniel waited near the hall-door on that ill-omened night; and\r\nas soon as he heard the Freiherr open the postern leading to the tower,\r\nhe entered the hall and proceeded to where the Freiherr was standing,\r\nclose by the brink of the chasm. On becoming aware of the presence of\r\nhis villainous servant, in whose eyes the gleam of murder shone, the\r\nFreiherr turned round and said with a cry of terror, \"Daniel, Daniel,\r\nwhat are you doing here at this hour?\" But then Daniel shrieked wildly,\r\n\"Down with you, you mangy cur!\" and with a powerful push of his foot he\r\nhurled the unhappy man over into the deep chasm.\r\n\r\nTerribly agitated by this awful deed, Freiherr Roderick found no peace\r\nin the castle where his father had been murdered. He went to his\r\nCourland estates, and only visited R--sitten once a year, in autumn.\r\nFrancis--old Francis--who had strong suspicions as to Daniel's guilt,\r\nmaintained that he often haunted the place at full moon, and described\r\nthe nature of the apparition much as V--- afterwards experienced it for\r\nhimself when he exorcised it. It was the disclosure of these\r\ncircumstances, also, which stamped his father's memory with dishonour,\r\nthat had driven young Freiherr Hubert out into the world.\r\n\r\nThis was my old great-uncle's story. Now he took my hand, and whilst\r\nhis eyes filled with tears, he said, in a broken voice, \"Cousin,\r\ncousin! And she too--the beautiful lady--has fallen a victim to the\r\ndark destiny, the grim, mysterious power which has established itself\r\nin that old ancestral castle. Two days after we left R--sitten the\r\nFreiherr arranged an excursion on sledges as the concluding event of\r\nthe visit. He drove his wife himself; but as they were going down the\r\nvalley the horses, for some unexplained reason, suddenly taking fright,\r\nbegan to snort and kick and plunge most savagely. 'The old man! The old\r\nman is after us!' screamed the Baroness in a shrill, terrified voice.\r\nAt this same moment the sledge was overturned with a violent jerk, and\r\nthe Baroness was hurled to a considerable distance. They picked her up\r\nlifeless--she was quite dead. The Freiherr is perfectly inconsolable,\r\nand has settled down into a state of passivity that will kill him. We\r\nshall never go to R--sitten again, cousin!\"\r\n\r\nHere my uncle paused. As I left him my heart was rent by emotion; and\r\nnothing but the all-soothing hand of Time could assuage the deep pain\r\nwhich I feared would cost me my life.\r\n\r\nYears passed. V---- was resting in his grave, and I had left my native\r\ncountry. Then I was driven northwards, as far as St. Petersburg, by the\r\ndevastating war which was sweeping over all Germany. On my return\r\njourney, not far from K----, I was driving one dark summer night along\r\nthe shore of the Baltic, when I perceived in the sky before me a\r\nremarkably large bright star. On coming nearer I saw by the red\r\nflickering flame that what I had taken for a star must be a large fire,\r\nbut could not understand how it could be so high up in the air.\r\n\"Postilion, what fire is that before us yonder?\" I asked the man\r\nwho was driving me. \"Oh! why, that's not a fire; it's the beacon\r\ntower of R--sitten.\" \"R--sitten!\" Directly the postilion mentioned\r\nthe name all the experiences of the eventful autumn days which I had\r\nspent there recurred to my mind with lifelike reality. I saw the\r\nBaron--Seraphina--and also the remarkably eccentric old aunts--myself\r\nas well, with my bare milk-white face, my hair elegantly curled and\r\npowdered, and wearing a delicate sky-blue coat--nay, I saw myself in my\r\nlove-sick folly, sighing like a furnace, and making lugubrious odes on\r\nmy mistress's eyebrows. The sombre, melancholy mood into which these\r\nmemories plunged me was relieved by the bright recollection of V----'s\r\ngenial jokes, shooting up like flashes of coloured light, and I found\r\nthem now still more entertaining than they had been so long ago.\r\nThus agitated by pain mingled with much peculiar pleasure, I reached\r\nR--sitten early in the morning and got out of the coach in front of the\r\npost-house, where it had stopped I recognised the house as that of the\r\nland-steward; I inquired after him. \"Begging your pardon,\" said the\r\nclerk of the post-house, taking his pipe from his mouth and giving his\r\nnight-cap a tilt, \"begging your pardon; there is no land-steward here;\r\nthis is a Royal Government office, and the Herr Administrator is still\r\nasleep.\" On making further inquiries I learnt that Freiherr Roderick\r\nvon R----, the last lord of the entail, had died sixteen years before\r\nwithout descendants, and that the entail in accordance with the terms\r\nof the original deeds had now escheated to the state. I went up to the\r\ncastle; it was a mere heap of ruins. I was informed by an old peasant,\r\nwho came out of the fir-forest, and with whom I entered into\r\nconversation, that a large portion of the stones had been employed in\r\nthe construction of the beacon-tower. He also could tell the story of\r\nthe ghost which was said to have haunted the castle, and he affirmed\r\nthat people often heard unearthly cries and lamentations amongst the\r\nstones, especially at full moon.\r\n\r\nPoor short-sighted old Roderick! What a malignant destiny did you\r\nconjure up to destroy with the breath of poison, in the first moments\r\nof its growth, that race which you intended to plant with firm roots to\r\nlast on till eternity!\r\n\r\n                      *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO \"THE ENTAIL\":\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Freiherr = Baron, though not exactly in the present\r\nsignificance of the term in Germany.

Perhaps you may be\r\nacquainted from abundant descriptions with all the sights to be seen\r\nthere; but I should like it best of all if you have ever been there\r\nyourself in former times, and seen with your own eyes the wonderful\r\nhall into which I will now take you--I mean Arthur's Hall.[2]\r\n\r\nAt the hour of noon the hall was crammed full of men of the most\r\ndiverse nations, all pushing about and immersed to the eyes in\r\nbusiness, so that the ears were deafened by the confused din. But when\r\nthe exchange hours were over, and the merchants had gone to dinner, and\r\nonly a few odd individuals hurried through the hall on business (for it\r\nserved as a means of communication between two streets), that I dare\r\nsay was the time when you, gracious reader, liked to visit Arthur's\r\nHall best, whenever you were in Dantzic. For then a kind of magical\r\ntwilight fell through the dim windows, and all the strange reliefs and\r\ncarvings, with which the wall was too profusely decorated, became\r\ninstinct with life and motion. Stags with immense antlers, together\r\nwith other wonderful animals, gazed down upon you with their fiery eyes\r\ntill you could hardly look at them; and the marble statue of the king,\r\nalso in the midst of the hall, caused you to shiver more in proportion\r\nas the dusk of evening deepened. The great picture representing an\r\nassemblage of all the Virtues and Vices, with their respective names\r\nattached, lost perceptibly in moral effect; for the Virtues, being\r\nhigh up, were blended unrecognisably in a grey mist, whilst the\r\nVices--wondrously beautiful ladies in gay and brilliant costumes--stood\r\nout prominently and very seductively, threatening to enchant you with\r\ntheir sweet soft words. You preferred to turn your eyes upon the narrow\r\nborder which went almost all round the hall, and on which were\r\nrepresented in pleasing style long processions of gay-uniformed militia\r\nof the olden time, when Dantzic was an Imperial town. Honest\r\nburgomasters, their features stamped with shrewdness and importance,\r\nride at the head on spirited horses with handsome trappings, whilst\r\nthe drummers, pipers, and halberdiers march along so jauntily and\r\nlife-like, that you soon begin to hear the merry music they play, and\r\nlook to see them all defile out of that great window up there into the\r\nLangemarkt.[3]\r\n\r\nWhile, then, they are marching off, you, indulgent reader,--if you\r\nwere, that is, a tolerable sketcher,--would not be able to do otherwise\r\nthan copy with pen and ink yon magnificent burgomaster with his\r\nremarkably handsome page. Pen and ink and paper, provided at public\r\ncost, were always to be found lying about on the tables; accordingly\r\nthe material would be all ready at hand, and you would have felt the\r\ntemptation irresistible. This you would have been permitted to do, but\r\nnot so the young merchant Traugott, who, on beginning to do anything of\r\nthis kind, encountered a thousand difficulties and vexations. \"Advise\r\nour friend in Hamburg at once that that business has been settled, my\r\ngood Herr Traugott,\" said the wholesale and retail merchant, Elias\r\nRoos, with whom Traugott was about to enter upon an immediate\r\npartnership, besides marrying his only daughter, Christina. After a\r\nlittle trouble, Traugott found a place at one of the crowded tables; he\r\ntook a sheet of paper, dipped his pen in the ink, and was about to\r\nbegin with a free caligraphic flourish, when, running over once more in\r\nhis mind what he wished to say, he cast his eyes upwards. Now it\r\nhappened that he sat directly opposite a procession of figures, at the\r\nsight of which he was always, strangely enough, affected with an\r\ninexplicable sadness. A grave man, with something of dark melancholy in\r\nhis face, and with a black curly beard and dressed in sumptuous\r\nclothing, was riding a black horse, which was led by the bridle by a\r\nmarvellous youth: his rich abundance of hair and his gay and graceful\r\ncostume gave him almost a feminine appearance. The face and form of the\r\nman made Traugott shudder inwardly, but a whole world of sweet vague\r\naspirations beamed upon him from the youth's countenance. He could\r\nnever tear himself away from looking at these two; and hence, on the\r\npresent occasion, instead of writing Herr Elias Roos's letter of advice\r\nto Hamburg, he sat gazing at the wonderful picture, absently scribbling\r\nall over his paper. After this had lasted some time, a hand clapped him\r\non the shoulder from behind, and a gruff voice said, \"Nice--very nice;\r\nthat's what I like; something maybe made of that.\" Traugott, awakening\r\nout of his dreamy reverie, whisked himself round; but, as if struck by\r\na lightning flash, he remained speechless with amazement and fright,\r\nfor he was staring up into the face of the dark melancholy man who was\r\ndepicted on the wall before him. He it was who uttered the words stated\r\nabove; at his side stood the delicate and wonderfully beautiful youth,\r\nsmiling upon him with indescribable affection. \"Yes, it is they--the\r\nvery same!\" was the thought that flashed across Traugott's mind. \"I\r\nexpect they will at once throw off their unsightly mantles and stand\r\nforth in all the splendours of their antique costume.\" The members of\r\nthe crowd pushed backwards and forwards amongst each other, and the\r\nstrangers had soon disappeared in the crush; but even after the hours\r\nof 'Change were long over, and only a few odd individuals crossed the\r\nhall, Traugott still remained in the self-same place with the letter of\r\nadvice in his hand, as though he were converted into a solid stone\r\nstatue.\r\n\r\nAt length he perceived Herr Elias Roos coming towards him with two\r\nstrangers. \"What are you about, cogitating here so long after noon, my\r\nrespected Herr Traugott?\" asked Elias Roos; \"have you sent off the\r\nletter all right?\" Mechanically Traugott handed him the paper; but Herr\r\nElias Roos struck his hands together above his head, stamping at first\r\ngently, but then violently, with his right foot, as he cried, making\r\nthe hall ring again, \"Good God! Good God! what childish tricks are\r\nthese? Nothing but sheer childishness, my respected Traugott,--my\r\ngood-for-nothing son-in-law--my imprudent partner. Why, the devil must\r\nbe in your honour! The letter--the letter! O God! the post!\" Herr Elias\r\nRoos was almost choking with vexation, whilst the two strangers were\r\nlaughing at the singular letter of advice, which could hardly be said\r\nto be of much use. For, immediately after the words, \"In reply to yours\r\nof the 20th inst. respecting----\" Traugott had sketched the two\r\nextraordinary figures of the old man and the youth in neat bold\r\noutlines. The two strangers sought to pacify Herr Elias Roos by\r\naddressing him in the most affectionate manner; but Herr Elias Roos\r\ntugged his round wig now on this side and now on that, struck his cane\r\nagainst the floor, and cried, \"The young devil!--was to write letter of\r\nadvice--makes drawings--ten thousand marks gone--dam!\" He blew through\r\nhis fingers and then went on lamenting, \"Ten thousand marks!\" \"Don't\r\nmake a trouble of it, my dear Herr Roos,\" said at length the elder of\r\nthe two strangers. \"The post is of course gone; but I am sending off a\r\ncourier to Hamburg in an hour. Let me give him your letter, and it will\r\nthen reach its destination earlier than it would have done by the post\"\r\n\"You incomparable man!\" exclaimed Herr Elias, his face a perfect blaze\r\nof sunshine. Traugott had recovered from his awkward embarrassment; he\r\nwas hastening to the table to write the letter, but Herr Elias pushed\r\nhim away, casting a right malicious look upon him, and murmuring\r\nbetween his teeth, \"No need for you, my good son!\"\r\n\r\nWhilst Herr Elias was studiously busy writing, the elder gentleman\r\napproached young Traugott, who was standing silent with shame, and said\r\nto him, \"You don't seem to be exactly in your place, my good sir. It\r\nwould never have come into a true merchant's head to make drawings\r\ninstead of writing a business letter as he ought\" Traugott could not\r\nhelp feeling that this reproach was only too well founded. Much\r\nembarrassed, he replied, \"By my soul, this hand has already written\r\nmany admirable letters of advice; it is only, occasionally that such\r\nconfoundedly odd ideas come into my mind.\" \"But, my good sir,\"\r\ncontinued the stranger smiling, \"these are not confoundedly odd ideas\r\nat all. I can really hardly believe that all your business letters\r\ntaken together have been so admirable as these sketches, outlined\r\nso neatly and boldly and firmly. There is, I am sure, true genius\r\nin them.\" With these words the stranger took out of Traugott's hand\r\nthe letter--or rather what was begun as a letter but had ended in\r\nsketches--carefully folded it together, and put it in his pocket. This\r\nawakened in Traugott's mind the firm conviction that he had done\r\nsomething far more excellent than write a business letter. A strange\r\nspirit took possession of him; so that, when Herr Elias Roos, who had\r\nnow finished writing, addressed him in an angry tone, \"Your childish\r\nfolly might have cost me ten thousand marks,\" he replied louder and\r\nwith more decision than was his habit, \"Will your worship please not to\r\nbehave in such an extraordinary way, else I will never write you\r\nanother letter of advice so long as I live, and we will separate.\" Herr\r\nElias pushed his wig right with both hands and stammered, as he stared\r\nhard at Traugott, \"My estimable colleague, my dear, dear son, what\r\nproud words you are using!\" The old gentleman again interposed, and a\r\nfew words sufficed to restore perfect peace; and so they all went to\r\nHerr Elias's house to dinner, for he had invited the strangers home\r\nwith him. Fair Christina received them in holiday attire, all clean and\r\nprim and proper; and soon she was wielding the excessively heavy silver\r\nsoup-ladle with a practised hand.\r\n\r\nWhilst these five persons are sitting at table, I could, gracious\r\nreader, bring them pictorially before your eyes; but I shall only\r\nmanage to give a few general outlines, and those certainly worse than\r\nthe sketches which Traugott had the audacity to scribble in the\r\ninauspicious letter; for the meal will soon be over; and besides, I am\r\nurged by an impulse I cannot resist to go on with the remarkable\r\nhistory of the excellent Traugott, which I have undertaken to relate to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThat Herr Elias Roos wears a round wig you already know from what\r\nhas been stated above; and I have no need to add anything more; for\r\nafter what he has said, you can now see the round little man with his\r\nliver-coloured coat, waistcoat, and trousers, with gilt buttons, quite\r\nplainly before your eyes. Of Traugott I have a very great deal to say,\r\nbecause this is his history which I am telling, and so of course he\r\noccurs in it. If now it be true that a man's thoughts and feelings and\r\nactions, making their influence felt from within him outwards, so model\r\nand shape his bodily form as to give rise to that wonderful harmony of\r\nthe whole man, that is not to be explained but only felt, which we call\r\ncharacter, then my words will of themselves have already shown you\r\nTraugott himself in the flesh. If this is not the case, then all my\r\ngossip is wasted, and you may forthwith regard my story as unread. The\r\ntwo strangers are uncle and nephew, formerly retail dealers, but now\r\nmerchants trading on their gains, and friends of Herr Elias Roos, that\r\nis to say, they had a good many business transactions together. They\r\nlive at Königsberg, dress entirely in the English fashion, carry\r\nabout with them a mahogany boot-jack which has come from London,\r\npossess considerable taste for art, and are, in a word, experienced,\r\nwell-educated people. The uncle has a gallery of art objects and\r\ncollects hand-sketches (witness the pilfered letter of advice).\r\n\r\nBut properly my chief business was to give you, kindly reader, a true\r\nand life-like description of Christina; for her nimble person will, I\r\nobserve, soon disappear; and it will be as well for me to get a few\r\ntraits jotted down at once. Then she may willingly go! Picture to\r\nyourself a medium-sized stoutish female of from two to three and twenty\r\nyears of age, with a round face, a short and rather turned-up nose, and\r\nfriendly light-blue eyes, which smile most prettily upon everybody,\r\nsaying, \"I shall soon be married now.\" Her skin is dazzling white, her\r\nhair is not altogether of a too reddish tinge; she has lips which were\r\ncertainly made to be kissed, and a mouth which, though indeed rather\r\nwide, she yet screws up small in some extraordinary way, but so as to\r\ndisplay then two rows of pearly teeth. If we were to suppose that the\r\nflames from the next-door neighbour's burning house were to dart in at\r\nher chamber-window, she would make haste to feed the canary and lock up\r\nthe clean linen from the wash, and then assuredly hasten down into the\r\noffice and inform Herr Elias Roos that by that time his house also was\r\non fire. She has never had an almond-cake spoilt, and her melted-butter\r\nalways thickens properly, owing to the fact that she never stirs the\r\nspoon round towards the left, but always towards the right. But since\r\nHerr Elias Roos has poured out the last bumper of old French wine, I\r\nwill only hasten to add that pretty Christina is uncommonly fond of\r\nTraugott because he is going to marry her; for what in the name of\r\nwonder should she do if she did not get married?\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Herr Elias Roos proposed to his friends to take a walk on\r\nthe ramparts. Although Traugott, whose mind had never been stirred by\r\nso many wonderful and extraordinary things as to-day, would very much\r\nhave liked to escape the company, he could not contrive it; for, just\r\nas he was going out of the door, without having even kissed his\r\nbetrothed's hand, Herr Elias caught him by the coat-tails, crying, \"My\r\nhonoured son-in-law, my good colleague, but you're not going to leave\r\nus?\" And so he had to stay.\r\n\r\nA certain professor of physics once stated the theory that the _Anima\r\nMundi_, or Spirit of the World, had, as a skilful experimentalist,\r\nconstructed somewhere an excellent electric machine, and from it\r\nproceed certain very mysterious wires, which pass through the lives of\r\nus all; these we do our best to creep round and avoid, but at some\r\nmoment or other we must tread upon them, and then there passes a flash\r\nand a shock through our souls, suddenly altering the forms of\r\neverything within them. Upon this thread Traugott must surely have trod\r\nin the moment that he was unconsciously sketching the two persons who\r\nstood in living shape behind him, for the singular appearance of the\r\nstrangers had struck him with all the violence of a lightning-flash;\r\nand he now felt as if he had very clear conceptions of all those things\r\nwhich he had hitherto only dimly guessed at and dreamt about. The\r\nshyness which at other times had always fettered his tongue so soon as\r\nthe conversation turned upon things which lay concealed like holy\r\nsecrets at the bottom of his heart had now left him; and hence it was\r\nthat, when the uncle attacked the curious half-painted, half-carved\r\npictures in Arthur's Hall as wanting in taste, and then proceeded more\r\nparticularly to condemn the little pictures representing the soldiers\r\nas being whimsical, Traugott boldly maintained that, although it was\r\nvery likely true that all these things did not harmonize with the rules\r\nof good taste, nevertheless he had experienced, what indeed several\r\nothers had also experienced, viz., a wonderful and fantastic world had\r\nbeen unfolded to him in Arthur's Hall, and some few of the figures had\r\nreminded him in even lifelike looks, nay, even in plain distinct words,\r\nthat he also was a great master, and could paint and wield the chisel\r\nas well as the man out of whose unknown studio they themselves had\r\nproceeded Herr Elias certainly looked more stupid than usual whilst the\r\nyoung fellow was saying such grand things, but the uncle made answer in\r\na very malicious manner, \"I repeat once more, I do not comprehend why\r\nyou want to be a merchant, why you haven't rather devoted yourself\r\naltogether to art.\"\r\n\r\nTraugott conceived an extreme repugnance to the man, and accordingly he\r\njoined the nephew for the walk, and found his manner very friendly and\r\nconfidential. \"O Heaven!\" said the latter, \"how I envy you your\r\nbeautiful and glorious talent! I wish I could only sketch like you! I\r\nam not at all wanting in genius; I have already sketched some deucedly\r\npretty eyes and noses and ears, ay, and even three or four entire\r\nheads;--but, dash it all! the business, you know! the business!\" \"I\r\nalways thought,\" said Traugott, \"that as soon as a man detected the\r\nspark of true genius--of a genuine love for art--within him, he ought\r\nnot to know anything about any other business.\" \"You mean he ought to\r\nbe an artist!\" rejoined the nephew. \"Ah! how can you say so? See you\r\nhere, my estimable friend! I have, I believe, reflected more upon these\r\nthings than many others; in fact, I am such a decided admirer of art,\r\nand have gone into the real essential nature of the thing far deeper\r\nthan I am even able to express, and so I can only make use of hints and\r\nsuggestions.\" The nephew, as he expressed these opinions, looked so\r\nlearned and so profound that Traugott really began to feel in awe of\r\nhim. \"You will agree with me,\" continued the nephew, after he had taken\r\na pinch of snuff and had sneezed twice, \"you will agree with me that\r\nart embroiders our life with flowers; amusement, recreation after\r\nserious business--that is the praiseworthy end of all effort in art;\r\nand the attainment of this end is the more perfect in proportion as the\r\nart products assume a nearer approach to excellence. This end is very\r\nclearly seen in life; for it is only the man who pursues art in the\r\nspirit I have just mentioned who enjoys comfort and ease; whilst these\r\nfor ever and eternally flee away from the man who, directly contrary to\r\nthe nature of the case, regards art as a true end in itself--as the\r\nhighest aim in life. And so, my good friend, don't take to heart what\r\nmy uncle said to try and persuade you to turn aside from the serious\r\nbusiness of life, and rely upon a way of employing your energies which,\r\nif without support, will only make you stagger about like a helpless\r\nchild.\" Here the nephew paused as if expecting Traugott's reply; but\r\nTraugott did not know for the life of him what he ought to say. All\r\nthat the nephew had said struck him as indescribably stupid talk. He\r\ncontented himself with asking, \"But what do you really mean by the\r\nserious business of life?\" The nephew looked at him somewhat taken\r\naback. \"Well, by my soul, you can't help conceding to me that a man who\r\nis alive must live, and that's what your artist by profession hardly\r\never succeeds in doing, for he's always hard up.\" And he went on with a\r\nlong rigmarole of bosh, which he clothed in fine words and stereotyped\r\nphrases. The end of it all appeared to be pretty much this--that by\r\nliving he meant little else than having no debts but plenty of money,\r\nplenty to eat and drink, a beautiful wife, and also well-behaved\r\nchildren, who never got any grease-stains on their nice Sunday-clothes,\r\nand so on. This made Traugott feel a tightness in his throat, and he\r\nwas glad when the clever nephew left him, and he found himself alone in\r\nhis own room.\r\n\r\n\"What a wretched miserable life I lead, to be sure!\" he soliloquised.\r\n\"On beautiful mornings in the glorious golden spring-time, when into\r\neven the obscure streets of the town the warm west wind finds its way,\r\nand its faint murmurings and rustlings seem to be telling of all the\r\nwonders which are to be seen blooming in the woods and fields, then I\r\nhave to crawl down sluggishly and in an ill-temper into Herr Elias\r\nRoos's smoke-begrimed office. And there sit pale faces before huge\r\nugly-shaped desks; all are working on amidst gloomy silence, which is\r\nonly broken by the rustle of leaves turned over in the big books, by\r\nthe chink of money that is being counted, and by unintelligible sounds\r\nat odd intervals. And then again what work it is! What is the good of\r\nall this thinking and all this writing? Merely that the pile of gold\r\npieces may increase in the coffers, and that the Fafnir's[4] treasure,\r\nwhich always brings mischief, may glitter and sparkle more and more!\r\nOh, how gladly a painter or a sculptor must go out into the air, and\r\nwith head erect imbibe all the refreshing influences of spring, until\r\nthey people the inner world of his mind with beautiful images pulsing\r\nwith glad and energetic life! Then from the dark bushes step forth\r\nwonderful figures, which his own mind has created, and which continue\r\nto be his own, for within him dwells the mysterious wizard power of\r\nlight, of colour, of form; hence he is able to give abiding shape to\r\nwhat he has seen with the eye of his mind, in that he represents it in\r\na material substitute. What is there to prevent me tearing myself loose\r\nfrom this hated mode of life? That remarkable old man assured me that I\r\nam called to be an artist, and still more so did the nice handsome\r\nyouth. For although he did not speak a word, it yet somehow struck me\r\nthat his glance said plainly what I had for such a long time felt like\r\na vague emotional pulsation within me, and what, oppressed by a\r\nmultitude of doubts, has hitherto been unable to rise to the level of\r\nconsciousness. Instead of going on in this miserable way, could I not\r\nmake myself a good painter?\"\r\n\r\nTraugott took out all the things that he had ever drawn and examined\r\nthem with critical eyes. Several things looked quite different to-day\r\nfrom what they had ever done before, and that not worse, but better.\r\nHis attention was especially attracted by one of his childish attempts,\r\nof the time when he was quite a boy; it was a sketch of the old\r\nburgomaster and the handsome page, the outlines very much wanting in\r\nfirmness, of course, but nevertheless recognisable. And he remembered\r\nquite well that these figures had made a strange impression upon him\r\neven at that time, and how one evening at dusk they enticed him with\r\nsuch an irresistible power of attraction, that he had to leave his\r\nplaymates and go into Arthur's Hall, where he took almost endless pains\r\nto copy the picture. The contemplation of this drawing filled him with\r\na feeling of very deep yearning sadness. According to his usual habit,\r\nhe ought to go and work a few hours in the office; but he could not do\r\nit; he went out to the Carlsberg[5] instead. There he stood and gazed\r\nout over the heaving sea, striving to decipher in the waves and in the\r\ngrey misty clouds which had gathered in wonderful shapes over Hela,[6]\r\nas in a magic mirror, his own destiny in days to come.\r\n\r\nDon't you too believe, kindly reader, that the sparks which fall into\r\nour hearts from the higher regions of Love are first made visible to us\r\nin the hours of hopeless pain? And so it is with the doubts that storm\r\nthe artist's mind. He sees the Ideal and feels how impotent are his\r\nefforts to reach it; it will flee before him, he thinks, always\r\nunattainable. But then again he is once more animated by a divine\r\ncourage; he strives and struggles, and his despair is dissolved into a\r\nsweet yearning, which both strengthens him and spurs him on to strain\r\nafter his beloved idol, so that he begins to see it continually nearer\r\nand nearer, but never reaches it.\r\n\r\nTraugott was now tortured to excess by this state of hopeless pain.\r\nEarly next morning, on again looking over his drawings, which he had\r\nleft lying on the table he thought them all paltry and foolish, and he\r\nnow called to mind the oft-repeated words of one of his artistic\r\nfriends, \"A great deal of the mischief done by dabblers in art of\r\nmoderate abilities arises from the fact that so many people take a\r\nsomewhat keen superficial excitement for a real essential vocation to\r\npursue art.\" Traugott felt strongly urged to look upon Arthur's Hall\r\nand his adventure with the two mysterious personages, the old man and\r\nthe young one, for one of these states of superficial excitement; so he\r\ncondemned himself to go back to the office again; and he worked so\r\nassiduously at Herr Elias Roos's, without heeding the disgust which\r\nfrequently so far overcame him that he had to break off suddenly and\r\nrush off out into the open air. With sympathetic concern, Herr Elias\r\nRoos set this down to the indisposition which, according to his\r\nopinion, the fearfully pale young man must be suffering from.\r\n\r\nSome time passed; Dominic's Fair[7] came, after which Traugott was to\r\nmarry Christina and be introduced to the mercantile world as Herr Elias\r\nRoos's partner. This period he regarded as that of a sad leave-taking\r\nfrom all his high hopes and aspirations; and his heart grew heavy\r\nwhenever he saw dear Christina as busy as a bee superintending the\r\nscrubbing and polishing that was going on everywhere in the middle\r\nstory, folding curtains with her own hands, and giving the final polish\r\nto the brass pots and pans, &c.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the thick of the surging crowd of strangers in Arthur's\r\nHall, Traugott heard close behind him a voice whose well-known tones\r\nmade his heart jump. \"And do you really mean to say that this stock\r\nstands at such a low figure?\" Traugott whisked himself quickly round,\r\nand saw, as he had expected, the remarkable old man, who had appealed\r\nto a broker to get him to buy some stock, the price of which had at\r\nthat moment fallen to an extremely low figure. Behind the old man stood\r\nthe youth, who greeted Traugott with a friendly but melancholy smile.\r\nThen Traugott hastened to address the old man. \"Excuse me, sir; the\r\nprice of the stock which you are desirous of selling is really no\r\nhigher than what you have been told; nevertheless, it may with\r\nconfidence be anticipated that in a few days the price will rise\r\nconsiderably. If, therefore, you take my advice, you will postpone the\r\nconversion of your stock for a little time longer.\" \"Eh! sir?\" replied\r\nthe old man rather coldly and roughly, \"what have you to do with my\r\nbusiness? How do you know that just now a silly bit of paper like this\r\nis of no use at all to me, whilst ready money is what I have great need\r\nof?\" Traugott, not a little abashed because the old man had taken his\r\nwell-meant intention in such ill part, was on the point of retiring,\r\nwhen the youth looked at him with tears in his eyes, as if in entreaty.\r\n\"My advice was well meant, sir,\" he replied quickly; \"I cannot suffer\r\nyou to inflict upon yourself an important loss. Let me have your stock,\r\nbut on the condition that I afterwards pay for it the higher price\r\nwhich it will be worth in a few day's time.\" \"Well, you are an\r\nextraordinary man,\" said the old man. \"Be it so then; although I can't\r\nunderstand what induces you to want to enrich me.\" So saying, he shot a\r\nkeen flashing glance at the youth, who cast down his beautiful blue\r\neyes in shy confusion. They both followed Traugott to the office, where\r\nthe money was paid over to the old man, whose face was dark and sullen\r\nas he put it in his purse. Whilst he was doing so, the youth whispered\r\nsoftly to Traugott, \"Are you not the gentleman who was sketching such\r\npretty figures several weeks ago in Arthur's Hall?\" \"Certainly I am,\"\r\nreplied Traugott, and he felt how the remembrance of the ridiculous\r\nepisode of the letter of advice drove the hot blood into his face. \"Oh\r\nthen, I don't at all wonder,\" the youth was continuing, when the old\r\nman gave him an angry look, which at once made him silent. In the\r\npresence of these strangers Traugott could not get rid of a certain\r\nfeeling of awkward constraint; and so they went away before he could\r\nmuster courage enough to inquire further into their circumstances and\r\nmode of life.\r\n\r\nIn fact there was something so quite out of the ordinary in the\r\nappearance of these two persons that even the clerks and others in the\r\noffice were struck by it. The surly book-keeper had stuck his pen\r\nbehind his ear, and leaning on his arms, which he clasped behind his\r\nhead, he sat watching the old man with keen glittering eyes. \"God\r\nforgive me,\" he said when the strangers had left the office, \"if he\r\ndidn't look like an old picture of the year 1400 in St. John's parish\r\nchurch, with his curly beard and black mantle.\" Herr Elias set him down\r\nwithout more ado as a Polish Jew, notwithstanding his noble bearing and\r\nhis extremely grave old-German face, and cried with a simper, \"Silly\r\nfellow! sells his stock now; might make at least ten per cent, more in\r\na week.\" Of course he knew nothing about the additional price which had\r\nbeen agreed upon, and which Traugott intended to pay out of his own\r\npocket. And this he really did do when some days later he again met the\r\nold man and the youth in Arthur's Hall.\r\n\r\nThe old man said, \"My son has reminded me that you are an artist also,\r\nand so I will accept what I should have otherwise refused.\" They were\r\nstanding close beside one of the four granite pillars which support the\r\nvaulted roof of the hall, and immediately in front of the two painted\r\nfigures which Traugott had formerly sketched in the letter of advice.\r\nWithout reserve he spoke of the great resemblance between these figures\r\nand the old man himself and the youth. The old man smiled a peculiar\r\nsmile, and laying his hand on Traugott's shoulder, said in a low and\r\ndeliberate tone, \"Then you didn't know that I am the German painter\r\nGodofredus Berklinger, and that it was I who painted the pictures which\r\nseem to give you so much pleasure, a long time ago, whilst still a\r\nlearner in art. That burgomaster I copied in commemoration of myself,\r\nand that the page who is leading the horse is my son you can of course\r\nvery easily see by comparing the faces and figures of the two.\"\r\nTraugott was struck dumb with astonishment. But he very soon came to\r\nthe conclusion that the old man, who took himself to be the artist of a\r\npicture more than two hundred years old must be labouring under some\r\npeculiar delusion. The old man went on, lifting up his head and looking\r\nproudly about him, \"Ay, that was an artistic age if you like--glorious,\r\nvigorous, flourishing, when I decorated this hall with all these gay\r\npictures in honour of the wise King Arthur and his Round Table. I\r\nverily believe that the tall stately figure who once came to me as I\r\nwas working here, and exhorted me to go on and gain my mastership--for\r\nat that time I had not reached that dignity,--was King Arthur himself.\"\r\nHere the young man interposed, \"My father is an artist, sir, who has\r\nfew equals; and you would have no cause to be sorry if he would allow\r\nyou to inspect his works.\" Meanwhile the old man was taking a turn\r\nthrough the hall, which had now become empty; he now called to the\r\nyouth to go, and then Traugott begged him to show him his pictures. The\r\nold man fixed his eyes upon him and regarded him for some time with a\r\nkeen and searching glance, and at length said with much gravity, \"You\r\nare, I must say, rather audacious to be wanting to enter the inner\r\nshrine before you have begun your probationary years. But--be it so! If\r\nyour eyes are still too dull to see, you may at least dimly feel. Come\r\nand see me early to-morrow morning,\" and he indicated where he lived.\r\nNext morning Traugott did not fail to get away from business early and\r\nhasten to the retired street where the remarkable old man lived. The\r\nyouth, dressed in old-German style, opened the door to receive him\r\nand led him into a spacious room, in the centre of which he found\r\nthe old man sitting on a little stool in front of a large piece of\r\noutstretched grey primed canvas. \"You have come exactly at the right\r\ntime, sir,\" the old man cried by way of greeting, \"for I have just put\r\nthe finishing-touch to yon large picture, which has occupied me more\r\nthan a year and cost me no small amount of trouble. It is the fellow of\r\na picture of the same size, representing 'Paradise Lost,' which I\r\ncompleted last year and which I can also show you here. This, as you\r\nwill observe, is 'Paradise Regained,' and I should be very sorry for\r\nyou if you begin to put on critical airs and try to get some allegory\r\nout of it Allegorical pictures are only painted by duffers and\r\nbunglers; my picture is not to _signify_ but to _be_. You perceive how\r\nall these varied groups of men and animals and fruits and flowers and\r\nstones unite to form one harmonic whole, whose loud and excellent music\r\nis the divinely pure chord of glorification.\" And the old man began to\r\ndwell more especially upon the individual groups; he called Traugott's\r\nattention to the secrets of the division of light and shade, to the\r\nglitter of the flowers and the metals, to the singular shapes which,\r\nrising up out of the calyx of the lilies, entwined themselves about\r\nthe forms of the divinely beautiful youths and maidens who were dancing\r\nto the strains of music, and he called his attention to the bearded men\r\nwho, with all the strong pride of youth in their eyes and movements,\r\nwere apparently talking to various kinds of curious animals. The old\r\nman's words, whilst they grew continually more emphatic, grew also\r\ncontinually more incomprehensible and confused. \"That's right, old\r\ngreybeard, let thy diamond crown flash and sparkle,\" he cried at last,\r\nriveting a fixed but fiery glance upon the canvas. \"Throw off the Isis\r\nveil which thou didst put over thy head when the profane approached\r\nthee. What art thou folding thy dark robe so carefully over thy breast\r\nfor? I want to see thy heart; that is the philosopher's stone through\r\nwhich the mystery is revealed. Art thou not I? Why dost thou put on\r\nsuch a bold and mighty air before me? Wilt thou contend with thy\r\nmaster? Thinkest thou that the ruby, thy heart, which sparkles so, can\r\ncrush my breast? Up then--step forward--come here! I have created thee,\r\nfor I am\"---- Here the old man suddenly fell on the floor like one\r\nstruck by lightning. Whilst Traugott lifted him up, the youth quickly\r\nwheeled up a small arm-chair, into which they placed the old man, who\r\nsoon appeared to have fallen into a gentle sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Now you know, my kind sir, what is the matter with my good old\r\nfather,\" said the youth softly and gently. \"A cruel destiny has\r\nstripped off all the blossoms of his life; and for several years past\r\nhe has been insensible to the art for which he once lived. He spends\r\ndays and days sitting in front of a piece of outstretched primed\r\ncanvas, with his eyes fixed upon it in a stare; that he calls painting.\r\nInto what an overwrought condition the description of such a picture\r\nbrings him, you have just seen for yourself. Besides this he is haunted\r\nby another unhappy thought, which makes my life to be a sad and\r\nagitated one; but I regard it as a fatality by which I am swept along\r\nin the same stream that has caught him. You would like something to\r\nhelp you to recover from this extraordinary scene; please follow me\r\nthen into the adjoining room, where you will find several pictures of\r\nmy father's early days, when he was still a productive artist.\"\r\n\r\nAnd great was Traugott's astonishment to find a row of pictures\r\napparently painted by the most illustrious masters of the Netherlands\r\nSchool. For the most part they represented scenes taken from real life;\r\nfor example, a company returning from hunting, another amusing\r\nthemselves with singing and playing, and such like subjects. They bore\r\nevidences of great thought, and particularly the expression of the\r\nheads, which were realised with especially vigorous life-like power.\r\nJust as Traugott was about to return into the former room, he noticed\r\nanother picture close beside the door, which held him fascinated to the\r\nspot. It was a remarkably pretty maiden dressed in old-German style,\r\nbut her face was exactly like the youth's, only fuller and with a\r\nlittle more colour in it, and she seemed to be somewhat taller too. A\r\ntremor of nameless delight ran through Traugott at the sight of this\r\nbeautiful girl. In strength and vitality the picture was quite equal to\r\nanything by Van Dyk. The dark eyes were looking down upon Traugott with\r\na soft yearning look, whilst her sweet lips appeared to be half opened\r\nready to whisper loving words. \"O heaven! Good heaven!\" sighed\r\nTraugott with a sigh that came from the very bottom of his heart;\r\n\"where--oh! where can I find her?\" \"Let us go,\" said the youth.\r\nThen Traugott cried in a sort of rapturous frenzy, \"Oh! it is indeed\r\nshe!--the beloved of my soul, whom I have so long carried about in my\r\nheart, but whom I only knew in vague stirrings of emotion. Where--oh!\r\nwhere is she?\" The tears started from young Berklinger's eyes; he\r\nappeared to be shaken by a convulsive and sudden attack of pain, and to\r\ncontrol himself with difficulty. \"Come along,\" he at length said, in a\r\nfirm voice, \"that is a portrait of my unhappy sister Felicia.[8] She\r\nhas gone for ever. You will never see her.\"\r\n\r\nLike one in a dream, Traugott suffered himself to be led into the\r\nother room. The old man was still sleeping; but all at once he started\r\nup, and staring at Traugott with eyes flashing with anger, he cried,\r\n\"What do you want? What do you want, sir?\" Then the youth stepped\r\nforward and reminded him that he had just been showing his new picture\r\nto Traugott, had he forgotten? At this Berklinger appeared to recollect\r\nall that had passed; it was evident that he was much affected; and he\r\nreplied in an undertone, \"Pardon an old man's forgetfulness, my good\r\nsir.\" \"Your new piece is an admirable--an excellent work. Master\r\nBerklinger,\" Traugott proceeded; \"I have never seen anything equal to\r\nit. I am sure it must cost a great deal of study and an immense amount\r\nof labour before a man can advance so far as to turn out a work like\r\nthat. I discern that I have an inextinguishable propensity for art, and\r\nI earnestly entreat you, my good old master, to accept me as your\r\npupil; you will find me industrious.\" The old man grew quite cheerful\r\nand amiable; and embracing Traugott, he promised that he would be a\r\nfaithful master to him.\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass that Traugott visited the old painter every day\r\nthat came, and made very rapid progress in his studies. He now\r\nconceived an unconquerable disgust of business, and was so careless\r\nthat Herr Elias Roos had to speak out and openly find fault with him;\r\nand finally he was very glad when Traugott kept away from the office\r\naltogether, on the pretext that he was suffering from a lingering\r\nillness. For this same reason the wedding, to Christina's no little\r\nannoyance, was indefinitely postponed. \"Your Herr Traugott seems to be\r\nsuffering from some secret trouble,\" said one of Herr Elias Roos's\r\nmerchant-friends to him one day; \"perhaps it's the balance of some old\r\nlove-affair that he's anxious to settle before the wedding-day. He\r\nlooks very pale and distracted.\" \"And why shouldn't he then?\" rejoined\r\nHerr Elias. \"I wonder now,\" he continued after a pause,--\"I wonder\r\nnow if that little rogue Christina has been having words with him? My\r\nbook-keeper--the love-smitten old ass--he is always kissing and\r\nsqueezing her hand. Traugott's devilishly in love with my little girl,\r\nI know. Can there be any jealousy? Well, I'll sound my young\r\ngentleman.\"\r\n\r\nBut however carefully he sounded he could find no satisfactory bottom,\r\nand he said to his merchant-friend, \"That Traugott is a most peculiar\r\nfellow; well, I must just let him go his own way; though if he had not\r\nfifty thousand thalers in my business I know what I should do, since\r\nnow he never does a stroke of anything.\"\r\n\r\nTraugott, absorbed in art, would now have led a real bright sunshiny\r\nlife, had his heart not been torn with passionate love for the\r\nbeautiful Felicia, whom he often saw in wonderful dreams. The picture\r\nhad disappeared; the old man had taken it away; and Traugott durst not\r\nask him about it without risk of seriously offending him. On the whole,\r\nold Berklinger continued to grow more confidential; and instead of\r\ntaking any honorarium for his instruction, he permitted Traugott to\r\nhelp out his narrow house-keeping in many ways. From young Berklinger\r\nTraugott learned that the old man had been obviously taken in in the\r\nsale of a little cabinet, and that the stock which Traugott had\r\nrealised for them was all that they had left of the price received for\r\nit, as well as all the money they possessed. But it was only seldom\r\nthat Traugott was allowed to have any confidential conversation with\r\nthe youth; the old man watched over him with the most singular\r\njealousy, and at once scolded him sharply if he began to converse\r\nfreely and cheerfully with their friend. This Traugott felt all the\r\nmore painfully since he had conceived a deep and heart-felt affection\r\nfor the youth, owing to his striking likeness to Felicia. Indeed he\r\noften fancied, when he stood near the young man, that he was standing\r\nbeside the picture he loved so much, now alive and breathing, and that\r\nhe could feel her soft breath on his cheek; and then he would like to\r\nhave drawn the youth, as if he really were his darling Felicia herself,\r\nto his swelling heart.\r\n\r\nWinter was past; beautiful spring was filling the woods and fields with\r\nbrightness and blossoms. Herr Elias Roos advised Traugott either to\r\ndrink whey for his health's sake or to go somewhere to take the baths.\r\nFair Christina was again looking forward with joy to the wedding,\r\nalthough Traugott seldom showed himself--and thought still less of his\r\nrelations with her.\r\n\r\nOnce Traugott was confined to the office the whole day long, making a\r\nrequisite squaring up of his accounts, &c.; he had been obliged to\r\nneglect his meals, and it was beginning to get very dark when he\r\nreached Berklinger's remote dwelling. He found nobody in the first\r\nroom, but from the one adjoining he heard the music of a lute. He had\r\nnever heard the instrument there before. He listened; a song, from time\r\nto time interrupted, accompanied the music like a low soft sigh. He\r\nopened the door. O Heaven! with her back towards him sat a female\r\nfigure, dressed in old-German style with a high lace ruff, exactly like\r\nthe picture. At the noise which Traugott unavoidably made on entering,\r\nthe figure rose, laid the lute on the table, and turned round. It was\r\nshe, Felicia herself! \"Felicia!\" cried Traugott enraptured; and he was\r\nabout to throw himself at the feet of his beloved divinity when he felt\r\na powerful hand laid upon his collar behind, and himself dragged out of\r\nthe room by some one with the strength of a giant. \"You abandoned\r\nwretch! you incomparable villain!\" screamed old Berklinger, pushing him\r\non before him, \"so that was your love for art? Do you mean to murder\r\nme?\" And therewith he hurled him out at the door, whilst a knife\r\nglittered in his hand. Traugott flew downstairs and hurried back home\r\nstupefied; nay, half crazy with mingled delight and terror.\r\n\r\nHe tossed restlessly on his couch, unable to sleep. \"Felicia! Felicia!\"\r\nhe exclaimed time after time, distracted with pain and the pangs of\r\nlove. \"You are there, you are there, and I may not see you, may not\r\nclasp you in my arms! You love me, oh yes! that I know. From the pain\r\nwhich pierces my breast so savagely I feel that you love me.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning sun shone brightly into Traugott's chamber; then he got up,\r\nand determined, let the cost be what it might, that he would solve the\r\nmystery of Berklinger's house. He hurried off to the old man's, but his\r\nfeelings may not be described when he saw all the windows wide open and\r\nthe maid-servants busy sweeping out the rooms. He was struck with a\r\npresentiment of what had happened. Berklinger had left the house late\r\non the night before along with his son, and was gone nobody knew where.\r\nA carriage drawn by two horses had fetched away the box of paintings\r\nand the two little trunks which contained all Berklinger's scanty\r\nproperty. He and his son had followed half an hour later. All inquiries\r\nas to where they had gone remained fruitless: no livery-stable keeper\r\nhad let out horses and carriage to persons such as Traugott described,\r\nand even at the town gates he could learn nothing for certain;--in\r\nshort, Berklinger had disappeared as if he had flown away on the\r\nmantle[9] of Mephistopheles.\r\n\r\nTraugott went back home prostrated by despair. \"She is gone! She is\r\ngone! The beloved of my soul! All--all is lost!\" Thus he cried as he\r\nrushed past Herr Elias Roos (for he happened to be just at that moment\r\nin the entrance hall) towards his own room. \"God bless my soul!\" cried\r\nHerr Elias, pulling and tugging at his wig. \"Christina! Christina!\" he\r\nshouted, till the whole house echoed. \"Christina! You disgraceful girl!\r\nMy good-for-nothing daughter!\" The clerks and others in the office\r\nrushed out with terrified faces; the book-keeper asked amazed, \"But\r\nHerr Roos?\" Herr Roos, however, continued to scream without stopping,\r\n\"Christina! Christina!\" At this point Miss Christina stepped in through\r\nthe house-door, and raising her broad-brimmed straw-hat just a little\r\nand smiling, asked what her good father was bawling in this outrageous\r\nway for. \"I strictly beg you will let such unnecessary running away\r\nalone,\" Herr Elias began to storm at her. \"My son-in-law is a\r\nmelancholy fellow and as jealous as a Turk. You'd better stay quietly\r\nat home, or else there'll be some mischief done. My partner is in there\r\nscreaming and crying about his betrothed, because she will gad about\r\nso.\" Christina looked at the book-keeper astounded; but he gave a\r\nsignificant glance in the direction of the cupboard in the office where\r\nHerr Roos was in the habit of keeping his cinnamon water. \"You'd better\r\ngo in and console your betrothed,\" he said as he strode away. Christina\r\nwent up to her own room, only to make a slight change in her dress, and\r\ngive out the clean linen, and discuss with the cook what would have to\r\nbe done about the Sunday roast-joint, and at the same time pick up a\r\nfew items of town-gossip, then she would go at once and see what really\r\nwas the matter with her betrothed.\r\n\r\nYou know, kindly, reader, that we all of us, when in Traugott's case,\r\nhave to go through our appointed stages; we can't help ourselves.\r\nDespair is succeeded by a dull dazed sort of moody reverie, in which\r\nthe crisis is wont to occur; and this then passes over into a milder\r\npain, in which Nature is able to apply her remedies with effect.\r\n\r\nIt was in this stage of sad but beneficial pain that, some days later,\r\nTraugott again sat on the Carlsberg, gazing out as before upon the\r\nsea-waves and the grey misty clouds which had gathered over Hela; but\r\nhe was not seeking as before to discover the destiny reserved for him\r\nin days to come; no, for all that he had hoped for, all that he had\r\ndimly dreamt of, had vanished. \"Oh!\" said he, \"my call to art was a\r\nbitter, bitter deception. Felicia was the phantom who deluded me into\r\nthe belief in that which never had any other existence but in the\r\ninsane fancy of a fever-stricken mind. It's all over. I will give it\r\nall up, and go back--into my dungeon. I have made up my mind; I will go\r\nback.\" Traugott again went back to his work in the office, whilst the\r\nwedding-day with Christina was once more fixed. On the day before the\r\nwedding was to come off, Traugott was standing in Arthur's Hall,\r\nlooking, not without a good deal of heart-rending sadness, at the\r\nfateful figures of the old burgomaster and his page, when his eye fell\r\nupon the broker to whom Berklinger was trying to sell his stock.\r\nWithout pausing to think, almost mechanically in fact, he walked up to\r\nhim and asked, \"Did you happen to know the strikingly curious old man\r\nwith the black curly beard who some time ago frequently used to be seen\r\nhere along with a handsome youth?\" \"Why, to be sure I did,\" answered\r\nthe broker; \"that was the crack-brained old painter Gottfried\r\nBerklinger.\" \"Then don't you know where he has gone to and where he is\r\nnow living?\" asked Traugott again. \"Ay, that I do,\" replied the broker;\r\n\"he has now for a long time been living quietly at Sorrento along with\r\nhis daughter.\" \"With his daughter Felicia?\" asked Traugott so\r\nvehemently and so loudly that everybody turned round to look at him.\r\n\"Why, yes,\" went on the broker calmly, \"that was, you know, the pretty\r\nyouth who always followed the old man about everywhere. Half Dantzic\r\nknew that he was a girl, notwithstanding that the crazy old fellow\r\nthought there was not a single soul could guess it. It had been\r\nprophesied to him that if his daughter were ever to get married he\r\nwould die a shameful death; and accordingly he determined never to let\r\nanybody know anything about her, and so he passed her off everywhere\r\nas his son.\" Traugott stood like a statue; then he ran off through\r\nthe streets--away out of the town-gates--into the open country, into\r\nthe woods, loudly lamenting, \"Oh! miserable wretch that I am! It was\r\nshe--she, herself; I have sat beside her scores and hundreds of\r\ntimes--have breathed her breath--pressed her delicate hands--looked\r\ninto her beautiful eyes--heard her sweet words--and now I have lost\r\nher! No; not lost I will follow her into the land of art. I acknowledge\r\nthe finger of destiny. Away--away to Sorrento.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried back home. Herr Elias Roos got in his way; Traugott laid\r\nhold of him and carried him along with him into the room. \"I shall\r\nnever marry Christina, never!\" he screamed. \"She looks like _Voluptas_\r\n(Pleasure) and _Luxuries_ (Wantonness), and her hair is like that of\r\n_Ira_ (Wrath), in the picture in Arthur's Hall. O Felicia! Felicia! My\r\nbeautiful darling! Why do you stretch out your arms so longingly\r\ntowards me? I am coming, I am coming. And now let me tell you, Herr\r\nElias,\" he continued, again laying hold of the pale merchant, \"you\r\nwill never see me in your damned office again. What do I care for\r\nyour cursed ledgers and day-books? I am a painter, ay, and a good\r\npainter too. Berklinger is my master, my father, my all, and you are\r\nnothing--nothing at all.\" And therewith he gave Herr Elias a good\r\nshaking. Herr Elias, however, began to shout at the top of his voice,\r\n\"Help! help! Come here, folks! Help! My son-in-law's gone mad. My\r\npartner's in a raging fit Help! help!\" Everybody came running out of\r\nthe office. Traugott had released his hold upon Elias and now sank down\r\nexhausted in a chair. They all gathered round him; but when he suddenly\r\nleapt to his feet and cried with a wild look, \"What do you all want?\"\r\nthey all hurried off out of the room in a string, Herr Elias in the\r\nmiddle.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards there was a rustling of a silk dress, and a voice\r\nasked, \"Have you really gone crazed, my dear Herr Traugott, or are you\r\nonly jesting?\" It was Christina. \"I am not the least bit crazed, my\r\nangel,\" replied Traugott, \"nor is it one whit truer that I am jesting.\r\nPray compose yourself, my dear, but our wedding won't come off\r\nto-morrow; I shall never marry you, neither to-morrow, nor at any other\r\ntime.\" \"There is not the least need of it,\" said Christina very calmly.\r\n\"I have not been particularly pleased with you for some time, and some\r\none I know will value it far differently if he may only lead home as\r\nhis bride the rich and pretty Miss Christina Roos. Adieu!\" Therewith\r\nshe rustled off. \"She means the book-keeper,\" thought Traugott. As soon\r\nas he had calmed down somewhat he went to Herr Elias and explained to\r\nhim in convincing terms that he need not expect to have him either as\r\nhis son-in-law or as his partner in the business. Herr Elias reconciled\r\nhimself to the inevitable; and repeated with downright honest joy in\r\nthe office again and again that he thanked God to have got rid of that\r\ncrazy-headed Traugott--even after the latter was a long, long way\r\ndistant from Dantzic.\r\n\r\nOn at length arriving at the longed-for country, Traugott found a new\r\nlife awaiting him, bright and brilliant. At Rome he was introduced to\r\nthe circle of the German colony of painters and shared in their\r\nstudies. Thus it came to pass that he stayed there longer than would\r\nseem to have been permissible in the face of his longing to find\r\nFelicia again, by which he had hitherto been so restlessly urged\r\nonwards. But his longing was now grown weaker; it shaped itself in his\r\nheart like a fascinating dream, whose misty shimmer enveloped his life\r\non all sides, so that he believed that all he did and thought, and all\r\nhis artistic practice, were turned towards the higher supernatural\r\nregions of blissful intuitions. All the female figures which his now\r\nexperienced artistic skill enabled him to create bore lovely Felicia's\r\nfeatures. The young painters were greatly struck by the exquisitely\r\nbeautiful face, the original of which they in vain sought to find in\r\nRome; they overwhelmed Traugott with multitudes of questions as to\r\nwhere he had seen the beauty. Traugott however was very shy of telling\r\nof his singular adventure in Dantzic, until at last, after the lapse of\r\nseveral months, an old Königsberg friend, Matuszewski by name, who had\r\ncome to Rome to devote himself entirely to art, declared joyfully that\r\nhe had seen there--in Rome, the girl whom Traugott copied in all his\r\npictures. Traugott's wild delight may be imagined. He no longer\r\nconcealed what it was that had attracted him so strongly to art, and\r\nurged him on with such irresistible power into Italy; and his Dantzic\r\nadventure proved so singular and so attractive that they all promised\r\nto search eagerly for the lost loved one.\r\n\r\nMatuszewski's efforts were the most successful. He had soon found out\r\nwhere the girl lived, and discovered moreover that she really was the\r\ndaughter of a poor old painter, who just at that period was busy\r\nputting a new coat on the walls of the church Trinita del Monte. All\r\nthese things agreed nicely. Traugott at once hastened to the church in\r\nquestion along with Matuszewski; and in the painter, whom he saw\r\nworking up on a very high scaffolding, he really thought he recognised\r\nold Berklinger. Thence the two friends hurried off to the old man's\r\ndwelling, without having been noticed by him. \"It is she,\" cried\r\nTraugott, when he saw the painter's daughter standing on the balcony,\r\noccupied with some sort of feminine work. \"Felicia, my Felicia!\" he\r\nexclaimed aloud in his joy, as he burst into the room. The girl looked\r\nup very much alarmed. She had Felicia's features; but it was not\r\nFelicia. In his bitter disappointment poor Traugott's wounded heart was\r\nrent as if from innumerable dagger-thrusts. In a few words Matuszewski\r\nexplained all to the girl. In her pretty shy confusion, with her cheeks\r\ndeep crimson, and her eyes cast down upon the ground, she made a\r\nmarvellously attractive picture to look at; and Traugott, whose first\r\nimpulse had been quickly to retire, nevertheless, after casting but a\r\nsingle pained glance at her, remained standing where he was, as though\r\nheld fast by silken bonds. His friend was not backward in saying all\r\nsorts of complimentary things to pretty Dorina, and so helped her to\r\nrecover from the constraint and embarrassment into which she had been\r\nthrown by the extraordinary manner of their entrance. Dorina raised the\r\n\"dark fringed curtains of her eyes\" and regarded the stranger with a\r\nsweet smile, and said that her father would soon come home from his\r\nwork, and would be very pleased to see some German painters, for he\r\nesteemed them very highly. Traugott was obliged to confess that,\r\nexclusive of Felicia, no girl had ever excited such a warm interest in\r\nhim as Dorina did. She was in fact almost a second Felicia; the only\r\ndifferences were that Dorina's features seemed to him less delicate and\r\nmore sharply cut, and her hair was darker. It was the same picture,\r\nonly painted by Raphael instead of by Rubens.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the old gentleman came in; and Traugott now\r\nplainly saw that he had been greatly misled by the height of the\r\nscaffolding in the church, on which the old man had stood. Instead of\r\nhis being the strong Berklinger, he was a thin, mean-looking little old\r\nman, timid and crushed by poverty. A deceptive accidental light in the\r\nchurch had given his clean-shaved chin an appearance similar to\r\nBerklinger's black curly beard. In conversing about art matters the old\r\nman unfolded considerable ripe practical knowledge; and Traugott made\r\nup his mind to cultivate his acquaintance; for though his introduction\r\nto the family had been so painful, their society now began to exercise\r\na more and more agreeable influence upon him.\r\n\r\nDorina, the incarnation of grace and child-like ingenuousness, plainly\r\nallowed her preference for the young German painter to be seen. And\r\nTraugott warmly returned her affection. He grew so accustomed to the\r\nsociety of the pretty child (she was but fifteen), that he often spent\r\nthe whole day with the little family; his studio he transferred to the\r\nspacious apartment which stood empty next their rooms; and finally he\r\nestablished himself in the family itself. Hence he was able of his\r\nprosperity to do much in a delicate way to relieve their straitened\r\ncircumstances; and the old man could not very well think otherwise than\r\nthat Traugott would marry Dorina; and he even said so to him without\r\nreservation. This put Traugott in no little consternation: for he now\r\ndistinctly recollected the object of his journey, and perceived where\r\nit seemed likely to end. Felicia again stood before his eyes instinct\r\nwith life; but, on the other hand, he felt that he could not leave\r\nDorina. His vanished darling he could not, for some extraordinary\r\nreason, conceive of as being his wife. She was pictured in his\r\nimagination as an intellectual vision, that he could neither lose nor\r\nwin. Oh! to be immanent in his beloved intellectually for ever! never\r\nto have her and own her physically! But Dorina was often in his\r\nthoughts as his dearly loved wife; and as often as he contemplated the\r\nidea of again binding himself in the indissoluble bonds of\r\nbetrothal,[10] he felt a delicious tremor run through him and a gentle\r\nwarmth pervade his veins; and yet he regarded it as unfaithfulness to\r\nhis first love. Thus Traugott's heart was the scene of contest between\r\nthe most contradictory feelings; he could not make up his mind what to\r\ndo. He avoided the old painter; and _he_ accordingly feared Traugott\r\nintended to receive his dear child. He had moreover already spoken of\r\nTraugott's wedding as a settled thing; and it was only under this\r\nimpression that he had tolerated Dorina's familiar intimacy with\r\nTraugott, which otherwise would have given the girl an ill name. The\r\nblood of the Italian boiled within him, and one day he roundly declared\r\nto Traugott that he must either marry Dorina or leave him, for he would\r\nnot tolerate this familiar intercourse an hour longer. Traugott was\r\ntormented by the keenest annoyance as well as by the bitterest\r\nvexation. The old man he viewed in the light of a vile match-maker; his\r\nown actions and behaviour were contemptible; and that he had ever\r\ndeserted Felicia he now judged to be sinful and abominable. His heart\r\nwas sore wounded at parting from Dorina; but with a violent effort he\r\ntore himself free from the sweet bonds. He hastened away to Naples, to\r\nSorrento.\r\n\r\nHe spent a whole year in making the strictest inquiries after\r\nBerklinger and Felicia; but all was in vain; nobody knew anything about\r\nthem. The sole gleam of intelligence that he could find was a vague\r\nsort of presumption, which was founded merely upon the tradition\r\nthat an old German painter had been seen in Sorrento several years\r\nbefore--and that was all. After being driven backwards and forwards\r\nlike a boat on the restless sea, Traugott at length came to a stand in\r\nNaples; and in proportion as his industry in art pursuits again\r\nawakened, the longing for Felicia which he cherished in his bosom grew\r\nsofter and milder. But he never saw any pretty girl, if she was the\r\nleast like Dorina in figure, movement, or bearing, without feeling most\r\nbitterly the loss of the dear sweet child. Yet when he was painting he\r\nnever thought of Dorina, but always of Felicia; she continued to be his\r\nconstant ideal.\r\n\r\nAt length he received letters from his native town. Herr Elias Roos had\r\ndeparted this life, his business agent wrote, and Traugott's presence\r\nwas required in order to settle matters with the book-keeper, who had\r\nmarried Miss Christina and undertaken the business. Traugott hurried\r\nback to Dantzic by the shortest route.\r\n\r\nAgain he was standing in Arthur's Hall, leaning against the granite\r\npillar, opposite the burgomaster and the page; he dwelt upon the\r\nwonderful adventure which had had such a painful influence upon his\r\nlife; and, a prey to deep and hopeless sadness, he stood and looked\r\nwith a set fixed gaze upon the youth, who greeted him with living eyes,\r\nas it were, and whispered in a sweet and charming voice, \"And so you\r\ncould not desert me then after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I believe my eyes? Is it really your own respected self come back\r\nagain safe and sound, and quite cured of your unpleasant melancholy?\"\r\ncroaked a voice near Traugott. It was the well-known broker. \"I have\r\nnot found her,\" escaped Traugott involuntarily. \"Whom do you mean? Whom\r\nhas your honour not found?\" asked the broker. \"The painter Godofredus\r\nBerklinger and his daughter Felicia,\" rejoined Traugott. \"I have\r\nsearched all Italy for them; not a soul knew anything about them in\r\nSorrento.\" This made the broker open his eyes and stare at him, and he\r\nstammered, \"Where do you say you have searched for Berklinger and\r\nFelicia? In Italy? in Naples? in Sorrento?\" \"Why, yes; to be sure,\"\r\nreplied Traugott, very testily. Whereupon the broker struck his hands\r\ntogether several times in succession, crying as he did so, \"Did you\r\never now? Did you ever hear tell of such a thing? But Herr Traugott!\r\nHerr Traugott!\" \"Well, what is there to be so much astonished at?\"\r\nrejoined Traugott, \"don't behave in such a foolish fashion, pray. Of\r\ncourse a man will travel as far as Sorrento for his sweetheart's sake.\r\nYes, yes; I loved Felicia and followed her.\" But the broker skipped\r\nabout on one foot, and continued to say, \"Well, now, did you ever? did\r\nyou ever?\" until Traugott placed his hand earnestly upon his arm and\r\nasked, \"Come, tell me then, in heaven's name! what is it that you find\r\nso extraordinary?\" The broker began, \"But, my good Herr Traugott, do\r\nyou mean to say you don't know that Herr Aloysius Brandstetter, our\r\nrespected town-councillor and the senior of our guild, calls his little\r\nvilla, in that small fir-wood at the foot of Carlsberg, in the\r\ndirection of Conrad's Hammer, by the name of Sorrento? He bought\r\nBerklinger's pictures of him and took the old man and his daughter into\r\nhis house, that is, out to Sorrento. And there they lived for several\r\nyears; and if you, my respected Herr Traugott, had only gone and\r\nplanted your own two feet on the middle of the Carlsberg, you could\r\nhave had a view right into the garden, and could have seen Miss Felicia\r\nwalking about there dressed in curious old-German style, like the women\r\nin those pictures--there was no need for you to go to Italy. Afterwards\r\nthe old man--but that is a sad story\" \"Never mind; go on,\" said\r\nTraugott, hoarsely. \"Yes,\" continued the broker. \"Young Brandstetter\r\ncame back from England, saw Miss Felicia, and fell in love with her.\r\nComing unexpectedly upon the young lady in the garden, he fell upon his\r\nknees before her in romantic fashion, and swore that he would wed her\r\nand deliver her from the tyrannical slavery in which her father kept\r\nher. Close behind the young people, without their having observed it,\r\nstood the old man; and the very self-same moment in which Felicia said,\r\n'I will be yours,' he fell down with a stifled scream, and was dead as\r\na door nail. It's said he looked very very hideous--all blue and\r\nbloody, because he had by some inexplicable means burst an artery.\r\nAfter that Miss Felicia could not bear young Brandstetter at all, and\r\nat last she married Mathesius, criminal and aulic counsellor, of\r\nMarienwerder. Your honour, as an old flame, should go and see the _Frau\r\nKriminalräthin_. Marienwerder is not so far, you know, as your real\r\nItalian Sorrento. The good lady is said to be very comfortable and to\r\nhave enriched the world with divers children.\"\r\n\r\nSilent and crushed, Traugott hastened from the Hall. This issue of his\r\nadventure filled him with awe and dread. \"No, it is not she--it is not\r\nshe!\" he cried. \"It is not Felicia, that divine image which enkindled\r\nan infinite longing in my bosom, whom I followed into yon distant land,\r\nseeing her before me everywhere where I went like my star of fortune,\r\ntwinkling and glittering with sweet hopes. Felicia--_Kriminalräthin_\r\nMathesius! Ha! Ha! Ha!--_Kriminalräthin_ Mathesius!\" Traugott, shaken\r\nby extreme sensations of misery, laughed aloud and hastened in his\r\nusual way through the Oliva Gate along the Langfuhr[11] to the\r\nCarlsberg. He looked down into Sorrento, and the tears gushed from his\r\neyes. \"Oh!\" he cried, \"Oh! how deep, how incurably deep an injury, O\r\nthou eternal ruling Power, does thy bitter irony inflict upon poor\r\nman's soft heart! But no, no! But why should the child cry over the\r\nincurable pain when instead of enjoying the light and warmth he thrusts\r\nhis hand into the flames? Destiny visibly laid its hand upon me, but my\r\ndimmed vision did not recognise the higher nature at work; and I had\r\nthe presumption to delude myself with the idea that the forms, created\r\nby the old master and mysteriously awakened to life, which stepped down\r\nto meet me, were my own equals, and that I could draw them down into\r\nthe miserable transitoriness of earthly existence. No, no, Felicia, I\r\nhave never lost you; you are and will be mine for ever, for you\r\nyourself are the creative artistic power dwelling within me. Now,--and\r\nonly now have I first come to know you. What have you--what have I to\r\ndo with the _Kriminalräthin_ Mathesius? I fancy, nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither did I know what you should have to do with her, my respected\r\nHerr Traugott,\" a voice broke in. Traugott awakened out of his dream.\r\nStrange to say, he found himself, without knowing how he got there,\r\nagain leaning against the granite pillar in Arthur's Hall. The person\r\nwho had spoken the abovementioned words was Christina's husband. He\r\nhanded to Traugott a letter that had just arrived from Rome.\r\nMatuszewski wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Dorina is prettier and more charming than ever, only pale with longing\r\nfor you, my dear friend. She is expecting you every hour, for she is\r\nmost firmly convinced that you could never be untrue to her. She loves\r\nyou with all her heart. When shall we see you again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very pleased that we settled all our business this morning,\" said\r\nTraugott to Christina's husband after he had read this, \"for to-morrow\r\nI set out for Rome, where my bride is most anxiously longing for me.\"\r\n\r\n                      *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES TO \"ARTHUR'S HALL\":\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Written for the _Urania_ for 1817.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The _Artushof_ or _Junkerhof_ derives its names from its\r\nconnection with the Arthurian cycle of legends, and from the fact that\r\nthere the _Stadtjunker_, or wealthy merchants of Dantzic, used formerly\r\nto meet both to transact business and for the celebration of festive\r\noccasions.
