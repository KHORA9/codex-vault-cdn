His glance widened at her caution, but he nodded\r\nbriefly. She turned the key in the lock.\r\n\r\nNext second the two stepped softly into the room. Mrs. Kinney\r\ncarefully closed and locked the door behind them; and meanwhile the\r\nman, peering closely into the shadows of the place, made out a scene\r\nof such strangeness that he nearly forgot the woman's injunction.\r\n\r\nThe room was the private study of Dr. William Kinney. In itself, it\r\nwas not at all out of the ordinary. Shelves of books, cases of\r\nsurgical and psychological instruments, star charts, maps and\r\nastronomical apparatus--these told at once both the man's vocation\r\nand avocation. With these contents and rather severe furnishings the\r\nroom was merely interesting, not remarkable.\r\n\r\nBut its four chairs certainly were. Each of them was occupied by a\r\nhuman being; and as Mrs. Kinney and her caller entered, neither of\r\nthe four so much as stirred. They were all asleep.\r\n\r\nIn the nearest chair was the doctor himself, half sitting and half\r\nreclining; in fact, all four of the sleepers were in attitudes of\r\ncomplete relaxation. The doctor's gray head was resting on one\r\nshoulder wearily.\r\n\r\nOn his left was a man of medium height and commonplace countenance.\r\n\"Mr. Smith,\" whispered Mrs. Kinney, placing her mouth close to the\r\ncaller's ear, so that he might hear the better.\r\n\r\nOpposite these two sat a man and a woman, their chairs placed close\r\ntogether. The one was a slender, well-dressed, boyishly good looking\r\nyoung woman of perhaps thirty; the other a large, aggressively\r\nhandsome fellow possibly five years older. \"Mr. and Mrs. Van Emmon,\"\r\nexplained Mrs. Kinney, still in a whisper.\r\n\r\nThe four sat absolutely motionless; the caller, looking very\r\nclosely, could hardly make out the rising and falling of their\r\nchests as they breathed. Also, he saw that they were all connected,\r\nthe one with the other by means of insulated wires which ran to\r\nbrass bracelets around their wrists. At one point in this curious\r\ncircuit, a wire ran to a small group of electrical appliances placed\r\non a pedestal at the doctor's side; while the caller was still\r\nfurther puzzled to note that each of the sleepers was resting his or\r\nher feet on a stool, the legs of which, like the legs of each chair,\r\nwere tipped with glass.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute of this the caller turned upon Mrs. Kinney in such\r\ncomplete bewilderment that she instantly unlocked the door, and\r\nagain cautioning perfect silence, led the way into the corridor.\r\nHere she again locked the door. Upon leaving the spot, a quiet young\r\nman with keen gray eyes stepped from a room opposite, and at a nod\r\nfrom Mrs. Kinney proceeded to do sentry duty outside the study.\r\n\r\nOnce down-stairs and safely within the living-room--\r\n\r\n\"This is rather mean of you Mrs. Kinney!\" protested the man. \"Tell\r\nme all about it, quick!\"\r\n\r\nThe lady complacently took a chair. \"Well,\" she remarked innocently,\r\n\"I knew you'd want to see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"It serves you right,\" she went on blithely, \"for staying away so\r\nlong. Let's see--you left a year ago June, didn't you, Mr. Hill?\"\r\n\r\nHe swallowed something and managed to reply, \"Great guns, yes! I've\r\nbeen in the wilds of New Guinea for a year--without news of any\r\nkind! I saw my first newspaper on board the dirigible this morning!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well,\" commented Mrs. Kinney provokingly, \"you'll have to be\r\nhumored, I suppose.\" She cogitated unnecessarily long, then left the\r\nroom to get a folio of newspapers and magazines. One of these she\r\nselected with great deliberation, and opened it at the leading\r\narticle. Even then she would not hand it over right away. \"You\r\nremember that sky-car idea of the doctor's, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"His machine to explore space? He couldn't talk of anything else\r\nwhen I--you don't mean to say\"--incredulously--\"that he made a\r\nsuccess of that!\"\r\n\r\n\"He certainly did. Took a three weeks' tour of the planets, month\r\nbefore last!\"\r\n\r\nHill stared in amazement, then leaned forward suddenly and whisked\r\nthe magazine out of Mrs. Kinney's fingers. He held the paper with\r\nhands that trembled in excitement; and this is what he read, in the\r\nmatter-of-fact black-and-white of The Scientific New Zealander:\r\n\r\n            STAR EXPLORERS RETURN\r\n\r\n    Dr. Kinney and Party Visit Venus and Mercury\r\n\r\nBringing proofs which will satisfy the most skeptical, Dr. William\r\nG. Kinney, G. Van Emmon, E. Williams Jackson, and John W. Smith, who\r\nleft the earth on December 9 in a powerful sky-car of the doctor's\r\ndesign, returned on the 23rd, after having explored the two planets\r\nwhich lie between the earth and the sun.\r\n\r\nThey found Mercury to be a dead world, like the moon, except that it\r\nonce supported a civilization nearly as advanced as our own. They\r\ntell of a giant human, a veritable colossus, who was the planet's\r\nlast survivor.\r\n\r\nBut on Venus they discovered people still living! They are\r\nmarvelously developed people, infinitely more advanced than the\r\npeople of the earth, and enjoying a civilization that is well-nigh\r\nincredible. Among other things, they have learned how to visit other\r\nworlds without themselves leaving their planet. They do it by a kind\r\nof telepathy; they know all about us here on the earth; and they\r\nhave accumulated data regarding the peoples of hundreds of thousands\r\nof other planets! The four explorers are able to prove their\r\nstatements beyond the shadow of doubt. They possess photographs\r\nwhich speak for themselves; they have brought back relics from\r\nMercury and materials from Venus, such as never existed on the\r\nearth. They submit a vast library of extraordinarily advanced\r\nscientific literature, which was given to them by the Venusians.\r\n\r\nThe article went on to detail, to the extent of some eight or ten\r\npages, the main features of the exploration. Hill, however, did not\r\nstop to read it all just then. He looked up, his thoughts flying to\r\nthe strange scene in the room up-stairs. \"What are they\r\ndoing--recuperating?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly.\" Mrs. Kinney was a little disappointed. \"Here--let me\r\npoint out the paragraph.\" And she ran a finger down the column until\r\nit indicated this line:\r\n\r\nAmong other things they have learned how to visit other worlds\r\nwithout themselves leaving their planet. They do this by a kind of\r\ntelepathy.\r\n\r\n\"That's the explanation,\" Mrs. Kinney said quietly. Hill fairly\r\nblinked when he read the paragraph. \"They are trying out one of the\r\nVenusian experiments?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course; you know the doctor. He couldn't resist the temptation.\r\nAnd I must say the others are just as bad.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smith is quite as much interested as Mr. Van Emmon. Mr. Smith\r\nis an electrical engineer; the other man is a geologist, and a very\r\nadventurous spirit. As for Mrs. Van Emmon--\"\r\n\r\n\"But this account mentions\"--Hill referred to the magazine--\"'E.\r\nWilliams Jackson.' Who was he?\"\r\n\r\n\"She--not he. Mrs. Van Emmon now; she used to be an architect. She\r\nhad the other three fooled for ten days; she passed herself off as a\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\nBut Hill was too absorbed in the general strangeness of the affair\r\nto note this amazing item. He again glanced at the article, opened\r\nhis mouth once or twice as though to ask a question, thought better\r\nof it each time, and finally got to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Let me have this?\" referring to the magazine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kinney handed over the rest of the collection.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure the doctor would want you to read them. I remember he\r\nsaid, just before they started away, that he wished you could have\r\ngone with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he?\" much pleased. Hill made some affectionate remark, under\r\nhis breath about \"the star-gazing old fraud\"; then, evidently in a\r\nhurry to get off by himself and read, he made his excuses and left\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kinney returned to the book she had been reading, glanced at\r\nthe clock, and noted that it was almost at the hour, previously\r\nagreed upon, that she should arouse the four up-stairs. She put the\r\nbook down and started toward the stairs.\r\n\r\nAt that instant a large gong sounded in the hall. In the study\r\nup-stairs, the doctor's hand moved away from a pushbutton. He\r\nstirred in his chair; and as he did so, the other three awakened.\r\nFirst Van Emmon, then \"Billie,\" his wife, and lastly the engineer.\r\n\r\nNext second all four were sitting bolt upright, and looking at each\r\nother eagerly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBACK ON EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Talk about results!\" Billie was first to speak. \"Why--where do you\r\nsuppose I found myself? Out in mid-ocean, in a small boat, with the\r\nspray flying into my--that is, into the face of--\" She broke off,\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\n\"Your agent?\" the doctor put in. All Billie could do was to nod; Van\r\nEmmon was bursting to talk.\r\n\r\n\"My agent was a Parisian apache, or I'm a bum guesser! I didn't\r\ncatch all that was going on, but it certainly sounded like the plans\r\nand specifications of a garroting!\"\r\n\r\n\"No such excitement here,\" said Smith. But his eyes were sparkling.\r\n\"I was going the rounds with a mail-carrier. How do you explain\r\nthat, doc? I've never given mail-carrying a second thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would have nothing to do with it. As for myself, I was looking\r\nthrough the eyes of some member of the House of Representatives, in\r\nWashington. I recognized the building. They were calling the roll at\r\nthe time.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused while he made a note of the incident, for the sake of\r\nchecking up the hour with the newspaper accounts later on. Then he\r\nrubbed the knuckles of one hand in the palm of the other--a habit\r\nwhich indicated that a diagnosis was going on in his mind. The\r\nothers waited expectantly.\r\n\r\n\"There's a big difference,\" commented he, thoughtfully, \"between\r\nthese experiences and our last experiments. Then, each of us knew\r\nexactly what to expect. Each had a definite image of a certain\r\nparticular person in mind when he went into the teleconscious state.\r\nThat made it comparatively easy for us to communicate the way we\r\ndid, even when you\"--indicating the bride and groom--\"were still in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n\"But to-day neither of us had the slightest idea what was coming.\r\nThat is, if we followed the rule. Did you\"--addressing Smith--\"take\r\ncare to concentrate strictly upon the one idea of view-point?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing else. I kept my attention fixed upon eyes and ears, only,\r\njust as the instructions read.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same here,\" answered Billie, for herself and the geologist.\r\n\r\n\"Then we know this much: So long as the four of us are connected up\r\nin this fashion\"--holding up his braceleted wrists--\"we combine our\r\nforces to such an extent that we do not need a definite object. It's\r\nsimply the power of harmony.\"\r\n\r\nBillie was anxious to get it down pat. \"In other words, there's\r\nnothing to prevent me from locating some one, although unknown to\r\nme, so long as we four agree upon the same locality?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it exactly. If we agree to concentrate upon Greenland, even,\r\nwe shall find four people there whose view-points resemble our own.\r\nThe main thing is to find similar view-points.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion along this line, in which the doctor made\r\nit clear that view-point was simply another name for perspective,\r\nand that it had nothing whatever to do with actual mental\r\naccomplishments. The view-point was really the soul.\r\n\r\n\"As yet,\" he went on, \"we should make no attempt to 'put ourselves\r\nin the other fellow's place.' Such efforts require a violent\r\nexertion of the imagination, and we need practice before tackling\r\nthe more advanced problems.\r\n\r\n\"Time enough, after a while, to get in touch with the Venusians.\r\nThere's none of them that has a view-point like ours. And once we've\r\ndone that--\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" from Billie, breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Anything! The whole universe will be open to us! Why, I understand\r\nfrom reading these books\"--indicating the Venusian manuscripts--\"that\r\nthere is such a thing as an intelligent creature, so utterly unlike\r\nourselves that--\" He stopped short.\r\n\r\n\"For the time being,\" said Smith quickly, \"we'd better be content\r\nwith something familiar. Is there some other planet in our solar\r\nsystem that would do, doc?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. According to the Venusians, the only others that are habitable\r\nbesides Venus and the earth, are Mars and Jupiter. And it seems that\r\nthe people on these two are so totally different--\"\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't get an answer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very unlikely. Besides, I am having the cube refitted for a\r\ntwo-months' cruise. Rather thought I'd like to visit Mars and\r\nJupiter in person.\r\n\r\n\"But when it comes to leaving the solar system entirely the\r\ntelepathic method is the only one that will work; even the nearest\r\nof the fixed stars is out of the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far is that?\" Smith inquired.\r\n\r\n\"The nearest? About four and a half light-years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but what's a light-year?\"\r\n\r\n\"It amounts to sixty-three thousand times the distance from here to\r\nthe sun!\"\r\n\r\nSmith whistled. \"Nothing doing in the cube, that's sure. Besides,\r\ncould we expect to find any people like us in the neighborhood of\r\nthat star?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Alpha Centauri.\" The doctor reached for one of the Venusian\r\nbooks, and pointed out certain pages. \"It seems that the Class IIa\r\nstars--that is, suns--are the only ones which have planets in the\r\nright condition for the development of humans. The astronomers\r\nalready suspected as much, by the way. But the Venusians have\r\ndefinitely named a few systems whose evolution has reached points\r\nalmost identical with that of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Now, until we have acquired a certain amount of ability\"\r\n--examining the books more closely--\"our best chance will lie in the\r\nneighborhood of a giant star known to us as Capella.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capella.\" Billie had drawn a star-chart to her side. \"Where is that\r\nlocated?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Auriga, about half-way from Orion to the Pole Star. She's a big\r\nyellow sun.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, the Venusians say that this particular planet of\r\nCapella's has people almost exactly the same as those of the earth,\r\nexcept\"--speaking very clearly--\"except that they have had about one\r\ncentury more civilization!\"\r\n\r\nBillie exclaimed with delight. \"Say--this is going to be the best\r\nyet! To think of seeing what the earth is going to be like, a\r\nhundred years from now!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly Van Emmon's interest became acute. \"By George! Is that\r\nright, doc? Are we likely to learn what the next hundred years will\r\ndo for us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know exactly.\" The doctor spoke cautiously. \"That's merely\r\nwhat I infer from these books.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we do,\" ran on the geologist excitedly, \"we'll see how a lot of\r\nour present day theories will be worked out! I'm curious to see what\r\ncomes of them. Personally, I think most of them are plain nonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"That remains to be seen.\" The doctor glanced around. \"Remember:\r\nwhat we want is the view-point only; and the place is Capella's\r\nplanetary system. Ready?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer the others leaned back in their chairs. The doctor\r\ntouched the button at his side, as a signal to his wife; he settled\r\nhimself in his chair; and in a minute his head was dropping over\r\nagainst his shoulder. In another second the minds of the four\r\nexperimenters were out of their bodies; out, and in the twinkling of\r\nan eye, traversing space at absolute speed.\r\n\r\nFor thought, like gravitation, is instantaneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSMITH'S MIND WANDERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretly Smith hoped he might find an agent who also was an\r\nengineer. He had this in mind all the while he was repeating the\r\nVenusian formula, the sequence of thought-images which was\r\nnecessary to bring on the required state of mind. The formula had\r\nthe effect of closing his mind to all save telepathic energy, and\r\nopening wide the channels through which it controlled the brain.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he repeated the words, meanwhile concentrating with\r\nall the force of his newly trained will upon the single idea of\r\nseeing and hearing what was happening on the unknown, yet quite\r\nknowable planet--no sooner had his head sunk on his chest than he\r\nbecame aware of a strange sound.\r\n\r\nOn all sides unseen apparatus gave forth a medley of subdued jars\r\nand clankings. A variety of hissing sounds also were distinguishable.\r\nAnd meanwhile Smith was staring hard, with the eyes he had borrowed\r\nalong with the ears, at a pair of human hands.\r\n\r\nThese hands were manipulating a group of highly polished levers and\r\nhand-wheels. So long as his borrowed sight was fixed upon that group\r\nSmith was entirely ignorant of the surroundings. All he could\r\nsurmise was that his agents operated some sort of machinery.\r\n\r\nThen the agent glanced up; and Smith got his first shock. For he now\r\nsaw a cluster of indicating dials, such as one may see on the\r\ninstrument board of any automobile; but the trained engineer found\r\nhimself absolutely unable to interpret one of them. They were marked\r\nwith unknown figures!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the engineer received an unmistakable impression,\r\nquite as vivid as though something had been said aloud. \"Progress;\r\nall safe,\" was the thought-image that came to him.\r\n\r\nHe listened closely in hope of hearing a spoken word. Also, he tried\r\nhis best to make his agent look around the place. Other people might\r\nbe within sight. However, for a couple of minutes the oddly familiar\r\nhands kept manipulating the unfamiliar instruments.\r\n\r\nThen, somewhere quite close at hand, a deep-toned gong sounded a\r\nsingle stroke. Instantly the agent looked up; and Smith saw that he\r\nwas inspecting the interior of a large engine-room. He had time to\r\nnote the huge bulk of a horizontal cylinder, perhaps fifty feet in\r\ndiameter, in the immediate background; also a variety of other\r\nmechanisms, more like immensely enlarged editions of laboratory\r\napparatus than ordinary engines. Smith looked in vain for the\r\ncompact form of a dynamo or motor, and listened in vain for the\r\nsound of either. Then, in swift succession, came two strokes on the\r\nunseen gong, followed by a shrill whistle.\r\n\r\nSmith's borrowed eyes became fixed upon that group of dials again.\r\nTheir indicators began to shift, some rapidly, some slowly. Once the\r\nagent gave a swift glance through a round window--the place seemed\r\nto be lighted by ordinary daylight--and Smith saw something\r\nunrecognizable flit by.\r\n\r\nA little further progress, and then came three strokes on the gong,\r\nfollowed by a low thrumming. In response to these, the agent\r\ndeliberately picked out two levers, and pulled them down. When his\r\nglance returned to the dials, one of them showed immense\r\nacceleration.\r\n\r\nBy and by came another triple clanging, another pair of levers was\r\npulled down, and instantly the jarring and clanking gave way to a\r\ndecided rumble, low and distinct, but so powerful that it shook the\r\nair. At the same time the agent quit his post and went over to the\r\ngiant horizontal cylinder.\r\n\r\nNow Smith could see that this vast structure was merely part of an\r\nengine whose dimensions were quite beyond any former experience. It\r\nwas a simple affair, being merely a reciprocal machine like the most\r\nelementary form of steam engine. But, instead of being operated by\r\nsteam, it was a chemical machine; Smith's trained eyes told him that\r\nthe cylinder was really an enormous retort. And he noted with\r\nfurther perplexity that the prodigious piston-rod not only moved\r\nwith terrific speed, but in a strictly back-and-forth motion; its\r\nfar end did not revolve.\r\n\r\nThe agent seemed satisfied with it all. He turned about and\r\nwalked--so far as Smith could sense in the usual manner of earth's\r\nhumans--back to the dials again. Just then a door opened a short\r\ndistance away and another man entered.\r\n\r\nSmith would have mistaken him for the employee of some garage. He\r\nwas dressed in a suit of greasy blue overalls; and as he advanced\r\ntoward the eyes Smith was using, he looked about the room with\r\npracticed glance. He merely nodded to Smith's man, who returned the\r\nnod just as silently; and such was the extreme brevity of it all,\r\nSmith was afterward unable to describe the man.\r\n\r\nHis agent, thus relieved of his duty temporarily, strolled out\r\nanother door, which took him through a narrow corridor and another\r\ndoor, opening on to some sort of a balcony, or deck. Smith fully\r\nexpected to look upon an ocean.\r\n\r\nInstead, he found himself gazing into a sea of clouds. He was in\r\nsome sort of aircraft!\r\n\r\nNext moment, quite as though it had all been prearranged, a large\r\nsky-cruiser hove into sight perhaps a quarter of a mile away. It\r\nseemed to materialize out of the clouds, and rapidly bore down upon\r\nthe craft in which the agent stood.\r\n\r\nBut the practical man of the earth was eying the air-ship in\r\nincreasing amazement. For it was truly a ship; a huge vessel\r\nwonderfully like one of the old-fashioned freighters which used to\r\nsail the seas of the earth. What was more, it had four tall, sloping\r\nmasts, each spread with something remarkably like canvas; and that\r\nwhole incredible hulk was actually swinging in mid air!\r\n\r\nLooking closer, Smith saw that the masts were exceedingly tall; they\r\nheld enough canvas to propel ten ships. And each stick sloped back\r\nat so sharp an angle--much sharper than forty-five degrees--that the\r\nwind not only blew the craft along in its course, but actually\r\nsupported it as well.\r\n\r\nIt meant a wind which would make a hurricane seem tame. Either that,\r\nor air with greater density than any Smith knew about.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the cruiser came about into the wind, and at the same\r\ninstant it began to take in sail, all the sheets furling in unison.\r\nSimultaneously great finlike wings shot out of slits in the sides of\r\nthe hull; and immediately they began to beat the air, back and\r\nforth, back and forth, with the speed and motion of swallows.\r\n\r\nSo this was the meaning of the giant reciprocal engine! Instead of\r\nthe screw propeller which characterized earth's aircraft, these\r\nvessels employed the true bird principle, combining it with the\r\nsimple methods of primitive sailing craft.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ship stopped its wind-driven rush and began to employ\r\nits wings, the speed straightway slackened; and the ships began to\r\ndescend. About the same time the figures of several people appeared\r\non what might be called the bridge; and assuming that these people\r\nwere as large as the man whom Smith had seen enter the engine-room--a\r\nchap of average height--then that ship, in proportion, was all of a\r\nmile long!\r\n\r\nBut Smith's awe was not shared by his agent, who turned\r\nindifferently away and looked about the sky as though in search of\r\nother sights. In doing so, he leaned over the deck's railing; and\r\nSmith saw the sheer sides of the giant ship, extending fore and aft\r\nalmost indefinitely; while far overhead billowed vast clouds of\r\nwhite cloth. The vessel was now under sail.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile higher up, and almost that distance to one side, the\r\nagent's eyes made out two tiny specks. He watched them closely for a\r\nmoment as they pitched and tossed queerly about; then darted into\r\nthe engine-room, secured a pair of binoculars of an old, squat\r\npattern, and swiftly focused upon the nearer of the two.\r\n\r\nSmith instantly sensed a disaster. The object was a small air-craft,\r\nof a sort entirely strange to the engineer; yet he knew that it was\r\ndisabled. One of its queer wings was broken and fluttering, as the\r\nlittle machine dropped, tumbling and twisting erratically, in an\r\ninexplicably slow fashion toward the unseen ground. Smith glimpsed a\r\nsingle figure, presumably strapped in the seat.\r\n\r\nThen the focus changed to cover the other machine. It was of the\r\nsame type; and Smith saw that it was swooping in a steep spiral, its\r\ndriver leaning over in his seat, looking down.\r\n\r\nNext moment the two were in focus together. Every second they\r\ndropped closer and closer to Smith's borrowed eyes. And in less time\r\nthan it takes to tell it, they had come so close that when the\r\noccupant of the disabled craft lurched heavily to one side, Smith\r\ncould plainly make out the long, flying hair of a woman.\r\n\r\nShe was unconscious, and strapped in!\r\n\r\nHer craft capsized. At the same time the other driver--a\r\nman--maneuvered so as to spiral exactly around the wreck as it fell.\r\nWhen it came right side up again--now only a half a mile away--he\r\ndrove down so close that his machine nearly grazed the woman's head.\r\nAs he did so, he leaned over and tried to unfasten her. But the\r\nunsteadiness of her craft prevented this.\r\n\r\nHe made a second try. This time his own machine narrowly escaped\r\ninjury; he steered it hastily away from that damaged wing. And then\r\nhe made a supreme effort.\r\n\r\nBringing his machine directly across the top of the other as it once\r\nmore righted itself, he touched one of his controls, so that his own\r\nflier's spiral increased in steepness. Straightening up, he poised\r\nhimself while he coolly measured the distance; and then he calmly\r\nleaped a matter of ten or twelve feet, over and down to the top of\r\nthe other craft.\r\n\r\nThe shock of his landing steadied it. Clinging fast with one hand,\r\nthe man bent and unbuckled the woman's strap. Next instant he had\r\nlifted her, a dead weight, into his arms and then over his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nHis own machine was still scooting downward, its speed even greater\r\nthan that of the broken flier. When the man saw it swinging past and\r\nbelow him, he instantly clambered, burden and all, to the edge of\r\nthe cockpit. For a second he stood, balancing precariously; and\r\nthen, half jumping, half diving, he plunged once more.\r\n\r\nMan and woman landed in a heap in the sound machine. In a flash the\r\nrescuer snatched his controls, and tried with all his might to\r\n\"straighten out.\" But it began to skid; and Smith saw, despite the\r\nshakiness with which his excited agent held the binoculars, that the\r\ncraft was hopelessly out of control. Next instant the man caught\r\nsight of the ship, not a hundred yards away; and steered straight\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nSmith's agent rushed back to the engine-room, where he immediately\r\nlocated a new group of instruments. Smith recognized a telephone and\r\nsome wireless apparatus; then found himself staring into some sort\r\nof a compound mirror system. Probably it was an illuminated tunnel\r\naffair, opening into a long white cabin. Seemingly the place was an\r\nemergency-ward.\r\n\r\nA moment later the unconscious forms of the two aviators were\r\nbrought within perhaps twenty feet. Smith could hear nothing; the\r\napparatus seemed made for looking only. But he saw the doctors hurry\r\nin, saw restoratives administered, and saw both people revive.\r\n\r\nThe man was first to become conscious. He looked around, seemed to\r\ntake in the situation at a glance, and swiftly got to his feet. The\r\ndoctors laid restraining hands upon him, but he shook them off with\r\na laugh.\r\n\r\nHe was a powerfully built man, considerably taller than normal and\r\nvery deep in the chest. He was decidedly blond, and good looking in\r\na cheerful, reckless sort of way.\r\n\r\nHis concern was for the woman. She regained her senses in half a\r\nminute, and shortly was sitting up and looking around. And Smith,\r\nordinarily unobservant of the other sex, found himself staring with\r\nall his eyes.\r\n\r\nShe was young; for that matter, the man was under thirty, also. And\r\nthe white bandage on her forehead only emphasized the dark eyes and\r\nvivid coloring of her face. Smith was half angry that he could not\r\nsee her more distinctly. He decided that every feature was\r\nexquisitely modeled, that he had never seen such delicate lines, nor\r\neyes as large, as appealing and as soft.\r\n\r\nThen he was watching the man again. He approached the woman and took\r\nher outstretched hand. He was laughing easily; she, smiling\r\ntremulously and gratefully. They looked into one another's eyes\r\nquite as though there were no one else in the cabin to be looked at.\r\nNext second one of the doctors stepped up bruskly, and Smith saw a\r\nswift blush come to the girl's cheeks. The man reddened, too, and\r\nturned away laughing to hide his confusion.\r\n\r\nSmith's connection with his agent ended right there. When he\r\nreported to the other three, later on, he had to admit that, so far\r\nas he knew, the man and the girl were still holding hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNEW HEARTS FOR OLD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBillie's experience was totally different. She found herself\r\ntransformed into a mental humming-bird.\r\n\r\nHer mind seemed to be darting with infinite rapidity, here and there\r\nthroughout the universe. She got only the most lightninglike glimpse\r\nof any one spot; flash after flash of unfamiliar, indescribable\r\nsituations succeeded each other like the speeded-up scenes of a\r\nphotoplay farce. For an unguessable length of time this\r\nhelter-skelter process occupied her mind.\r\n\r\nThen there came a scene which stayed. It was dim at first; she was\r\nmore thoroughly aware of the sound of voices than anything else.\r\nThen she saw clearly.\r\n\r\nShe--that is, her agent--was in some sort of a room, giving\r\ninstructions to a group of white-clad figures. Before Billie could\r\nconcentrate upon what was being said the talk ceased; and next\r\nmoment, amid perfect silence, the agent bent over something which\r\nlay on a high table.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Billie got a severe jolt. For, unless she was most\r\nwoefully mistaken, the thing she was now looking at was the\r\nunconscious form of a patient; the place was the operating-room of a\r\nhospital; and the eyes she was using belonged to a surgeon.\r\n\r\nShe watched breathlessly. The surgeon's nimble fingers proceeded\r\nwith the utmost unconcern to open wide the patient's torso. Other\r\npairs of hands, belonging to nurses, aided in this; and Billie found\r\nthe intricate process decidedly interesting rather than otherwise.\r\nOf course she was spared the odor of blood.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ribs were entirely displaced, the lungs were\r\ncarefully laid aside. Extraordinary delicacy seemed called for here.\r\nBillie shortly began to wonder if it were not high time to quit when\r\nher agent, assisted as before, calmly exposed the patient's heart to\r\nfull view.\r\n\r\nBillie could see it throbbing; more, she could hear it. She watched\r\nin wonder for the next step.\r\n\r\nThey consisted in forcibly untangling the mass of tubes and arteries\r\nall about the organ. Presently everything was clear; and then,\r\nwithout delay, the nurses brought forward a strange-looking device.\r\n\r\nIt was of silver, shaped like a flattened egg, and a trifle smaller\r\nthan that laboring, human blood-pump; To it was attached a pair of\r\nlong, flexible, silver pipes, which led to Billie knew not where.\r\nAnd near one extremity the egg was provided with eight curious\r\nnozzles.\r\n\r\nAt times the flying hands partly interfered with Billie's vision;\r\nyet she saw nearly all that amazing process, from beginning to end.\r\nTo put it briefly, the eight nozzles were boldly introduced, almost\r\nat a single operation, into tiny incisions in the eight\r\ncorresponding tubes of the heart. In they were forced, until they\r\nfilled the arteries and veins; and once inserted, silver clamps were\r\ninstantly tightened on the outsides of the tubes. All this was done\r\nin two or three seconds; and when all was complete, the heart itself\r\nhad been entirely isolated and its place absolutely taken by that\r\nlittle silver egg.\r\n\r\nThe patient gave no sign that anything out of the ordinary had\r\noccurred. Not a drop of blood had been spilled except in the process\r\nof getting at the organ; but now, with a few deft motions of certain\r\ninstruments, the heart was sliced away from the surrounding tissues,\r\nthe tubes were severed, and the whole powerful pump, still beating\r\nfaintly, was removed from the body altogether.\r\n\r\nNext, the surgeon proceeded to stanch the bleeding of the tubes;\r\nthat is, of the stubs projecting below those tight silver nozzles.\r\nThis done, the nimble fingers calmly replaced the lungs and other\r\nitems, quite as though they were reassembling a piece of machinery.\r\nLastly, the opening was sewed up in a manner which would have\r\ndelighted any seamstress.\r\n\r\nThe two long silver pipes were left protruding. Now, for the first\r\ntime, Billie saw where they led to.\r\n\r\nOn a stand alongisde the operating-table stood an extremely small,\r\nflat box, with its lid open. The pipes ended there. And as the\r\nsurgeon inspected the outfit Billie saw that it comprised, in\r\neffect, a pair of diminutive air-pumps. There were two tiny dials, a\r\nregulating device, some sort of an automatic electric switch, and\r\nwhat looked like a steel storage tank; all on a watchlike scale.\r\n\r\nLooking more closely, Billie made out two pairs of electric wires\r\nrunning from this case to another of the same size. The surgeon\r\nlifted its lid, disclosing two electric storage batteries, each with\r\nits own circuit.\r\n\r\nIn short, the arrangement provided duplicate sources, in vest-pocket\r\nsize, of power for operating a mechanical heart. The electricity\r\nworked the air-pumps, which in turn supplied the little silver\r\negg--implanted in the patient--with both pressure and vacuum, while\r\ndoubtless the artificial organ itself housed a valve system which\r\ndid the rest. The regulating device kept the blood circulating at\r\nthe proper rate.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon seemed satisfied with it all, and, after another\r\ncritical examination of the patient, glanced about the room,\r\nstraightened up, took a deep breath, and spoke:\r\n\r\n\"Quick work. Thanks very much, everybody.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Billie did not know which to be the more astonished at: the fact\r\nthat the voice was unmistakably a woman's, or that she, Billie, was\r\nable to understand all that was said. She did not fully appreciate\r\nuntil afterward that it was her own brain which did the translating;\r\nthe surgeon's subconscious mind had merely furnished a thought-image\r\nwhich would have been exactly the same, regardless of language.\r\n\r\n\"Any special instructions, Surgeon Aldor?\" inquired one of the\r\nwhite-clad, face-swathed figures.\r\n\r\n\"No. The usual handling. Simply keep the batteries charged in\r\nrotation.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon took off a mouth mask and a blood-soaked apron, and then\r\nswiftly washed her hands. Next she stepped briskly from the room;\r\nand the architect who was using her eyes rejoiced to see the\r\ndoor-knobs of the standard height of thirty-five inches, indicating\r\nthat this agent of hers was of about her own height. From the sound\r\nof her footsteps, however, Billie concluded that she was somewhat\r\nheavier than herself.\r\n\r\nReaching another room, the surgeon proceeded to don hat and coat.\r\nNext, she stepped in front of a long mirror; but the action was so\r\nquick, and it took Billie so completely by surprise, she was not\r\nable to inspect the image closely. To be frank, she looked first at\r\nthe woman's clothes, finding that her suit was a very trim affair of\r\nblue leather, cut in a semi-military fashion. Slashes of dark-red\r\nmaterial across the sleeves were repeated about the collar, while\r\nthe cap, a jaunty affair with a bell crown, matched the suit. The\r\nlower ends of the breeches, much like ordinary riding trousers, were\r\ntucked into high lace-up boots of red leather.\r\n\r\nBefore Billie could see any more other than that the surgeon was\r\nsmall-featured in striking contrast to the robustness of her body,\r\nshe stepped from the room. A moment later an automatic elevator took\r\nher to a lower floor, where she was greeted by a person whom Billie\r\nassumed to be a head nurse.\r\n\r\n\"Anything out of the ordinary, surgeon?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" with a bruskness which was startling by comparison with her\r\ncheeriness upstairs. \"I understand that Dr. Norbith wishes to go\r\nhome as soon as possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may go as soon as the cast is hard. Make sure his machine is a\r\nsmooth one.\"\r\n\r\nThe nurse simply nodded as the surgeon stepped on, through a very\r\nordinary pair of sliding doors, and so on out into an anteroom and\r\nthence to a porch, where she stood looking into the street for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nIt was exceedingly broad, and lined on both sides with imposing\r\nstructures whose architecture was entirely strange to Billie. She\r\nwould liked to have examined them all in detail; but she had no\r\ncontrol over her agent, who straightway walked down a short flight\r\nof steps and thence to a sidewalk.\r\n\r\nHere Billie became perfectly willing to neglect the architecture.\r\nPeople were coming and going; people apparently quite as human as\r\nherself. Except for a certain gorgeous voluminousness of dress, they\r\nseemed for the most part simply men and women of affairs.\r\n\r\nFor it was comparatively easy to distinguish the sexes. The women's\r\ngarments, while not making any display of the strictly feminine\r\nlines, nevertheless did not attempt to disguise them. Billie saw\r\nthat loose breeches had completely displaced the skirt with these\r\nwomen; while the men invariably wore either knickerbockers or some\r\nother form of short trousers; so that the general effect was very\r\nyouthful. She saw no men with beards, although several wore their\r\nhair long, down to their shoulders, as though to compensate for\r\nthose women who chose to wear theirs short.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon seemed to have more leisure than most doctors. She stood\r\nfor some minutes, greeting perhaps a score of passers-by, all of\r\nwhom seemed to be proud of the acquaintance. Presently, however, the\r\nsidewalk became temporarily clear of pedestrians; and then Billie\r\nheard the surgeon mutter something to herself, such as was past all\r\nunderstanding at the time:\r\n\r\n\"The fools! The poor, ignorant cattle!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she turned and stepped to the middle of the street, where Billie\r\nhad already marked a large number of flying-machines. In fact, the\r\nspace from curb to curb was practically filled with them, all neatly\r\nparked.\r\n\r\nWithout exception they were ornithopters; that is, machines built on\r\nthe bird-wing principle, sustaining themselves by a flapping motion\r\nrather than by air-pressure due to a propeller. Their size varied\r\nfrom one-seater affairs of very small size to craft large enough to\r\nhold a score. Most were gaudily painted.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon's own machine was a two-seater, small but powerful in\r\ndesign. She stepped up a short ladder into a comfortable cockpit,\r\nprovided with a folding top, which at that time was laid back out of\r\nthe way. She proceeded to adjust various levers and hand-wheels,\r\nglanced at certain dials, touched a button, and immediately the\r\ncraft took flight, its wings beating the air with a dull leathery\r\nrhythm which drowned out the faint clanking of the machinery.\r\n\r\nA moment later the flier was high above the street. To Billie's\r\ndisappointment, the surgeon did not glance down enough to tell the\r\narchitect whether the street belonged to a city of any size.\r\nInstead, her agent drove carefully through the traffic, which Billie\r\nwould have called dangerously dense. She remembered that she had\r\nseen nothing but aircraft in that street; no automobiles at all.\r\n\r\nAnd then the flier was rushing through the air at a lively rate.\r\nBillie caught quick glimpses of innumerable machines, few of which\r\nwere moving in the same direction as the surgeon's.\r\n\r\nA few minutes more elapsed, and then Billie was experiencing a much\r\nhigher level, with the machine flying at what must have been a\r\ntremendous velocity. Shortly it was all but alone in the sky.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the surgeon's eyes made out something far below, which\r\npuzzled Billie exceedingly. It seemed to be a ship under full sail;\r\nonly, so far as she could see the craft was resting upon clouds, not\r\nair. It was still a long way ahead.\r\n\r\nAnd then Billie was given a glance aloft, where she saw another\r\ncraft, a small flapping affair like the surgeon's. It was just\r\nrising on a long slant so as to cross above her course. And at that\r\nvery instant there came a sharp crack, followed by a splintering\r\ncrash. The surgeon's flier lurched heavily to one side.\r\n\r\nNext second the woman was staring at her left wing. It was broken\r\nabout the middle and thrashing wildly. Another instant, and a part\r\nof the thing came loose, flew off, and struck the surgeon on the top\r\nof her head. A muffled cry, and then blackness came.\r\n\r\nAnd the next thing Billie saw was the emergency ward of Smith's\r\ngreat skycruiser, with the surgeon, blinking as she recovered,\r\nlooking up into the smiling face of her big blond rescuer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nCAPELLA'S DAUGHTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing that met the doctor's gaze, when his mind entered\r\nthat of his distant agent, was a clock. It was a very ordinary sort\r\nof an instrument, such as one sees in schools and offices; it had\r\ntwo hands, and a pendulum of the usual size and length.\r\n\r\nHowever, this pendulum was swinging at a very rapid rate; nearly\r\ntwice as fast, judged the doctor, as that of his own chronometer.\r\nAnd its dial was divided into twenty-five equal parts, instead of\r\ntwelve, each of these parts being further divided into five equal\r\nportions. At the moment, these two hands indicated what would have\r\nbeen called, on the earth, about half past three.\r\n\r\nBefore the doctor could speculate on this, his unknown agent shifted\r\nhis gaze to a newspaper on a desk before him. Apparently he was\r\nthinking of something entirely different; for he absently turned the\r\npages, one by one, his subconscious mind taking it all in.\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor saw that the paper was called simply The Hourly\r\nJournal; that it was of very nearly the size of most sheets; and\r\nthat it consisted of about ten pages. The front and back pages,\r\nonly, contained news items; the remainder were packed solid with\r\nadvertisements. Not one of these were striking enough for the doctor\r\nto remember; he said they were exactly like large-size professional\r\n\"cards,\" except that they applied to every business, from candy to\r\nbridges. As for the news items, each was short, unsensational, with\r\nthe simplest kind of head-lines. More the doctor had no chance to\r\nobserve.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the agent stowed the paper away, and looked up. Presumably\r\nhe was seated in some sort of a theater. Directly ahead was the\r\nfamiliar white rectangle of a photoplay-house screen. And all about\r\nhim were heads and shoulders, seemingly belonging to young folks, of\r\nabout high-school age. Even to \"low necks\" for the girls and white\r\ncollars for the boys, they were identically like people of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if it had not been for that clock the doctor would have\r\nconcluded that there was some mistake, and have ended the\r\nexperiment. For some time he learned little; the place was filled\r\nwith a confused murmur. His agent, however, took no part in the\r\nconversation that produced this effect; once or twice he yawned.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the buzz came to a stop; and next moment a tall figure\r\nstepped upon the platform in front of the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Class,\" began this person immediately, \"to-day we will summarize\r\nwhat we have learned during the past week about the solar system of\r\nwhich our planet is one element.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke the doctor saw that there had been no mistake. For,\r\nalthough the agent's subconscious mind had served to translate what\r\nwas said into language understandable by the doctor, yet his eyes\r\nplainly told him that the professor's lips were saying something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it. For all that the doctor could tell by\r\nwatching the speaker's mouth, he might have been talking in Eskimo.\r\nBut his meaning was quite as clear as though he had said it in\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\"We will begin with a picture of the sun herself.\" As the words were\r\nspoken, a motion-picture film was projected on the screen. The\r\ndoctor instantly noted the natural colors, stereoscopic effect, and\r\nmarvelous clearness, such as branded this exhibition as not of the\r\nearth. But the professor was saying:\r\n\r\n\"The sun controls, besides this world, no less than thirty\r\nothers\"--and the doctor knew, as well as other people know their A B\r\nC's, that the earth's planetary family consists of only eight--\"no\r\nless than thirty others, of which eight are now without life.\" The\r\nspeaker turned toward a student on the far left. \"Tell us how many\r\nof the thirty are still too hot to support life, Miss Ballens.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl did not get to her feet. \"Ten,\" was her answer.\r\n\r\n\"Which leaves, of course, twelve besides our own planet which now\r\npossess life in one form or another. Mr. Ernol, can you give us some\r\nidea of conditions on any one of these?\"\r\n\r\nTo the doctor's immense satisfaction, the brain whose loan he was\r\nenjoying responded to the question. \"On Saloni, the vertebrates have\r\nnot yet appeared. None but the lowest forms of life have been\r\nfound.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this planet larger or smaller than ours, Mr. Ernol?\"\r\n\r\n\"Larger. It will be a matter of millions of centuries before such\r\nbeings as humans are evolved there.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do we know these facts?\"\r\n\r\nAs though it were a signal, the entire class, with one accord,\r\nuttered a single word: \"Runled!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor found his agent's eyes turned, together with those of\r\nevery other student in the room, toward the portrait of a highly\r\nintellectual-looking man; it hung in the most conspicuous spot on\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n\"We must never forget,\" continued the man on the platform, \"that,\r\nbut for the explorations of this man and his space-boat, some eighty\r\nyears ago, we should know very little. Can any one tell me why his\r\nexplorations have never been repeated?\"\r\n\r\nTwo hands went up. The professor nodded to a girl seated next to the\r\nyoung fellow whom the doctor now knew as \"Ernol.\" This girl spoke\r\nvery clearly: \"Because the expedition was extremely costly, and the\r\ncommission has never been willing to appropriate enough to duplicate\r\nthe work.\"\r\n\r\n\"The commission's judgment is, of course, sound,\" commented the\r\nprofessor calmly. Then he signaled for a change in the picture,\r\nwhich had been showing, in rapid succession, glimpses of world after\r\nworld. The new picture was more leisurely.\r\n\r\n\"The planet Alma. Can any one explain why it is of special interest\r\nto us?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was no comment, and the doctor found himself\r\nstudying a \"panorama\" of some exceedingly striking people. There was\r\nquite a crowd; and the doctor was amazed to note how much like the\r\nVenusians they were. Without exception they were delicately built,\r\nwith thin, shriveled legs; all were seated, none standing, in\r\ncigar-shaped aircraft of a type entirely new to the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"The people of Alma,\" spoke up a boy out of sight of Ernol, \"are\r\nespecially interesting to us because they are, so far as is known,\r\nthe most highly developed beings in existence.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way are they like us?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are vertebrates, mammals, primates, just as we are.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do they differ from us?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are 'cooperative democrats'; that is, they do not compete with\r\neach other for a living, but work together in all things, in\r\ncomplete equality. In this way they have become so wonderfully\r\nadvanced that--\"\r\n\r\nThe professor interrupted. \"We will not go into that.\" The scene\r\nshifted from people to things: a large, complicated-looking column\r\nof some sort was being shown. \"What does this tell us?\"\r\n\r\n\"It tells us,\" spoke up some one, \"that Alma is entirely surrounded\r\nand covered by a great roof, which stands several miles above the\r\nsurface.\" [Footnote: Compare with Venus. It would seem that,\r\nwhenever a planet reached a certain age, its people will always take\r\nsteps to preserve its atmosphere; that is, provided their\r\ncivilization is high enough.]\r\n\r\n\"What is the purpose of this roof?\"\r\n\r\n\"To keep in the air and moisture, which all other planets are\r\nsteadily losing. Alma is a much older planet than ours, which is why\r\nher people are so far advanced.\"\r\n\r\nNext came \"close-ups\" of some inhabitants. At once the doctor saw\r\nthat these were not Venusians; they had facial expressions as sour\r\nand cynical as the typical Venusian's had been pleasant and wise.\r\n\r\n\"You will note,\" commented the professor very quietly, \"that these\r\npeople are far from happy.\"\r\n\r\nThe class seemed to take it for granted; but the doctor's trained\r\nears instantly caught a false note in the speaker's voice. Was the\r\nman sure of his statement?\r\n\r\nAt the same time the doctor became aware of a certain dullness in\r\nthe vision he was borrowing. Also, the speaking became much less\r\ndistinct. It occurred to him that the boy might be drowsy; and an\r\nunmistakable nodding shortly made this certain.\r\n\r\n\"As we see from these photographs,\" droned the voice on the\r\nplatform, \"happiness does not exist on Alma. And if not there, where\r\nelse can we expect to find it? Certainly not among the less\r\ndeveloped planets.\r\n\r\n\"So we must conclude that ours is the only world where the people\r\nare truly happy. We must thank the commission for the peculiar\r\ndistinction which we enjoy. Ours is the only civilization which\r\nguarantees happiness to all; these pictures prove it for us.\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant young Ernol lifted his head with a jerk. \"How do we\r\nknow,\" he demanded, \"that these photographs were not very cunningly\r\nselected to give us a wrong idea? Perhaps they lie, professor!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly consternation reigned. The professor fairly froze in his\r\ntracks, while every eye in the room was turned in amazement upon the\r\nlad.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed the speaker sternly. \"Where did you get such an\r\nextraordinary notion, Mr. Ernol?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy had sat up straight, looking about uncertainly. He got\r\nunsteadily to his feet. \"Why--\" he stammered helplessly. \"Why, I\r\nhaven't any idea--What have I been saying, sir?\"\r\n\r\nThe professor checked a hasty answer. He said quietly: \"Do you mean\r\nto say you are unaware that you spoke just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I mean--\" The boy was badly puzzled. \"To be frank, sir, I\r\nwas almost asleep. I studied about Alma years ago. I know I said\r\nsomething, but as to what it was--\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do.\" The professor made a sign, and Ernol sat down,\r\ntremendously embarrassed. \"The class will understand that people,\r\nwhen talking in their sleep, usually say things which are the exact\r\nopposite of what they know to be true.\"\r\n\r\nThe man wet his lips, as though with satisfaction at the neatness of\r\nhis wording. He added in a generous tone: \"I will not reprimand Mr.\r\nErnol, because his previous work indicates, as he says, that Alma is\r\nan old topic to him. I only wish that he stood as well in certain\r\nother studies!\"\r\n\r\nA ripple of laughter ran over the class, and again the puzzled youth\r\nwas the target for the combined stares of the students. He slipped\r\ndown deep into his seat.\r\n\r\n\"That will do for to-day,\" said the teacher, glancing at the clock.\r\n\"Tomorrow we will begin the study of the other suns of the\r\nuniverse--what we commonly call stars.\r\n\r\n\"However, before you go\"--his voice took on a certain\r\nominousness--\"let me remind you that it is the custom not to\r\nquestion the sources of our information. We take them for granted.\r\nIn fact, it is more than a custom; the regulations require that any\r\nstudent who is not satisfied with the sincerity of our public school\r\nsystem shall be suspended for the first objection, and for the\r\nsecond shall forfeit all educational rights whatever.\r\n\r\n\"You will readily see for yourselves, then, that it will not be wise\r\nfor any of you to repeat what Mr. Ernol unconsciously let slip. And\r\nof course none of you will be so unkind as to remind him of what he\r\nsaid.\"\r\n\r\nThe students rose thoughtfully to their feet, and Ernol passed out\r\nwith the rest. He had no idea what it was all about, nor the\r\nslightest suspicion that his eyes and ears had been used.\r\n\r\nBut the doctor had learned something of enormous value. He had\r\nlearned that, when his agent was in a semiconscious state, his--the\r\ndoctor's--conscious mind could influence the agent.\r\n\r\nIt was not Ernol, but the doctor, who had made the slip!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD'S BOSSES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVan Emmon was afterward unable to recall any experience between his\r\nentering the sublimial state and becoming tele-conscious. That is,\r\nhis only recollection was of a definite scene, experienced through\r\nthe eyes and ears of his agent.\r\n\r\nThe place was a large high-ceilinged room, its architecture\r\nsuggesting some public building. In the center, and directly in\r\nfront of Van Emmon's agent, stood a large, rectangular table, about\r\nwhich sat a number of men. Van Emmon counted nine of them.\r\n\r\nThe whole atmosphere was solemn and important. Van Emmon was\r\nreminded of old photographs of cabinet meetings in Washington, of\r\nstrategy boards during the great war. He listened intently for\r\nsomething to be said.\r\n\r\nNear the foot of the table--Van Emmon's agent sat at the head--a\r\ntall man with an imposing, square-cut beard rose to his feet. He\r\ngazed at each of the other eight in turn, significantly; and when he\r\nspoke the geologist was so impressed with the deadly seriousness of\r\nthe scene that he forgot to be amazed at his ability to understand\r\nwhat was said, forgot to marvel that these men were, undeniably,\r\nhuman beings of exceptional character.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the man who had risen, \"I do not need to remind\r\nyou of the seriousness of this occasion. I only wish to congratulate\r\nyou, and myself, on the fact that we now have a chairman to whom we\r\ncan look with confidence. I say this without meaning any reflection\r\nupon his predecessor.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down, and immediately a white-haired man with a wide,\r\ncomplacent type of face arose and declared: \"No reflection is felt,\r\nsir. On the contrary, I am exceedingly glad that Mr. Powart is to\r\ntake my place. I only wish that the commission felt free to discard\r\nits rule of choosing by lots; I should like to present Mr. Powart\r\nwith the chair for as long a period as he would care to fill it.\"\r\n\r\nHe took his seat amid a general murmur of approval, while nine pair\r\nof eyes were turned in unison upon the pair Van Emmon was sharing.\r\nHis agent, then, was chairman of some sort of a council, known as\r\n\"the commission.\"\r\n\r\nPowart got to his feet. Even in this simple act his motions were\r\nswift and sure; they harmonized perfectly with the way he talked.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, both you. To be frank, I am glad, for the sake of the\r\nassociation, that the youngest commissioner has come to its head at\r\nthis time. If there were a younger than myself, I would say the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused and glanced at some memoranda in his hand. Van Emmon was\r\nstruck, first, by the smooth skin and perfect formation of the hand\r\nand wrist; and, second, by the peculiar writing on the papers. He\r\nhad no idea what it meant, although his agent certainly did.\r\n(Afterward the four concluded that, in the case of words written in\r\ncode or otherwise requiring an effort of the agent's conscious mind,\r\nthe people on the earth, being in touch only with the subconscious,\r\nwere never informed. But they never had any trouble in understanding\r\nanything that was said aloud.)\r\n\r\n\"If there are any special matters which should be handled in general\r\nsession, now is the time to bring them up,\" said Powart, and\r\nremained standing.\r\n\r\nAn undersized man with a remarkably large head of hair spoke up from\r\nthe righthand side of the table: \"I want to suggest that it is high\r\ntime we sent another expedition to Alma.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree,\" from the man who had been Powart's predecessor.\r\nApparently these ten men had nearly dispensed with parlimentary\r\nrules. \"What are the prospects, Powart?\"\r\n\r\n\"First rate. Runled's old space-boat has been renovated recently,\r\nand I understand that enough of the required materials have been\r\nmined to insure one round trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very fortunate that we shall be able to visit Alma again,\r\neven though we use up our entire supply in the attempt. It seems\r\nthat we shall soon need, and need badly, certain chemical secrets\r\nwhich they alone possess.\"\r\n\r\n\"When can the boat start?\"\r\n\r\n\"Within a week. I shall keep in touch with the crew by wireless, and\r\nadvise you of their progress from time to time. Alma is a sort of a\r\nhobby with me; I wouldn't mind taking the trip myself.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause. Powart waited, as though in expectation of\r\nfurther remarks, then gave another glance at his memoranda and\r\nbegan:\r\n\r\n\"Of course, we are mainly concerned with the demonstration in\r\nCalastia. As to its cause, I may mention that Eklan Norbith was in a\r\nhospital at the time, having a substitution. Had he been on the\r\nspot, the uprising would have been checked before any one heard of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"But it now seems that Calastia, during the last few hours, has\r\nbecome a seething hotbed of rebellion. Of course, we have isolated\r\nthe district, and a search for arms is now in progress.\r\n\r\n\"The head of the recalcitrants is a man named Ernol. He takes his\r\nconfinement as a matter of course, and no amount of pressure will\r\ninduce him to talk. Neither can we get anything from his companions,\r\nnor from his son.\r\n\r\n\"It is up to us to decide what measures to adopt.\"\r\n\r\nA large, pugnacious-looking man on the left put in the first\r\ncomment. \"Would it not be a saving of time to provoke violence, in\r\none way or another, and thus form a pretext for disposing of the\r\nentire lot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I admire your bluntness,\" remarked the former chairman across the\r\ntable, \"although I can't say as much for your philosophy. It is our\r\nduty to keep everybody contented; we cannot do any public\r\nweeding-out until the others are satisfied that the malcontents are\r\nreally weeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is clear enough,\" spoke the shock-headed man. \"What are the\r\nconditions, Powart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly normal. The percentage of overhead is only slightly higher\r\nthan average. Until Ernol moved into the locality every one seemed\r\ncontented with the regular arrangements.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is his contention?\"\r\n\r\n\"The usual democratic nonsense. He claims that the commission is\r\nautocratic, down to its last deputy. Denies that we have the right\r\nto apportion one-half the earnings to the workers and the other half\r\nto the owners. States that our system is wasteful, unjust, and\r\ndemoralizing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does he propose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Democratic control of industry. You know--that old line of talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he deny that the commission has abolished poverty and war?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but he points out that our present standard of living has not\r\nchanged for generations, and argues that degeneration must result.\r\nOf course, he is right in his fact but wrong in his conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't he admit the necessity of some sort of an international\r\ngoverning body?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but he claims that the commission should be elected by direct\r\nvote of the people!\"\r\n\r\nA general smile of derision greeted this. The only face that\r\nremained serious was that of the shock-headed man. He said:\r\n\r\n\"There must be a slip somewhere, Powart. Isn't there a heavy fine\r\nand imprisonment for teaching such stuff? How did Ernol ever get\r\nhold of the notion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably through tradition. We can't keep people from talking to\r\ntheir own children; perhaps Ernol's great-grandparents told him of\r\nthe days when every one was allowed to vote.\"\r\n\r\nThe shock-headed man got another idea. \"What has the man to say\r\nagainst our system of voting in proportion to property interests?\"\r\n\r\n\"Says it's all right in principle; but he claims that the earth\r\nbelongs to one and all, equally, and therefore each should have an\r\nequal voice in its disposition and government.\"\r\n\r\nThis time there was no smiling. The pugnacious-looking man spoke for\r\nthe rest when he said:\r\n\r\n\"We cannot allow such ideas to gain headway, Powart! Have you a\r\nplan?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must keep a close watch upon Calastia, and allow no one to leave\r\nits borders. As for Ernol, I have concluded that the best thing will\r\nbe--turn him loose!\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at him in consternation. He explained:\r\n\r\n\"I have been reading up the experience of the past few centuries in\r\nsuch cases; and if there is one thing that stands out clearer than\r\nany other it is this: the surest way to make the public sympathize\r\nwith a radical is to persecute him. But disregard him and ridicule\r\nhim, and his philosophy doesn't last long.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of trying to make an example of this chap, by severely\r\npunishing him, we shall let him go. It may be that he will object to\r\nthis; he may have discovered the same truths I have been reading,\r\nand would like nothing better than to become a 'martyr.' But we\r\nshall force him out, if need be.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose he continues his talking?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case we must simply watch our chance, and take him\r\nsecretly; if need be, arrest a thousand others at the same time. The\r\nmain thing is secrecy; so that the people cannot know, no matter\r\nwhat they may suspect, what has become of him. His final dispostion\r\nwill be a question of mere exediency.\"\r\n\r\nThe former chairman approved heartily. \"You've got the right idea,\r\nPowart. Is there anything further on tap?\"\r\n\r\nPowart put his notes away. \"Every national report is the same as\r\nusual; all quiet, and people apparently well satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"If there is no further business, we may consider ourselves\r\nadjourned.\"\r\n\r\nThe men got to their feet with the usual accompanying noises. The\r\ntall man with the square-cut beard immediately came and offered\r\nPowart his hand. Van Emmon noticed that they shook hands almost\r\nexactly as Americans would.\r\n\r\n\"Things seem to be coming your way, my boy,\" said the bearded man,\r\nhis keen eyes softening slightly. \"I saw the paper this morning.\r\nCongratulations! She is one girl in millions. Has she fixed the\r\ndate?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Mona was rather taken by surprise--to be frank with you,\r\nuncle.\"\r\n\r\nAs Powart spoke, he was eyeing the door and nodding permission for\r\nan attendant to enter. The man stepped obsequiously forward and\r\npresented a message, for all the world like any ordinary aerogram.\r\nPowart opened it while his uncle signed.\r\n\r\nThe chairman gave a low whistle of surprise. \"Mona had an accident\r\nwith her flier, a little while ago, and was rescued by \"--he looked\r\ncloser at the aerogram--\"a chap named Fort. She is now recuperating\r\non board the Cobulus.\"\r\n\r\nThe tall man took the message and read it himself, while Powart\r\nglanced about the room. Van Emmon caught a glimpse of a clock, and\r\nhe noted the pendulum especially. But before he could learn anything\r\nfurther, Dr. Kinney's hand jerked as before, and the gong rang. The\r\nfour awakened.\r\n\r\nThey had been \"visiting\" over an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nA WORLD BECALMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I think we have learned enough to form some general conclusions,\"\r\nsaid the doctor, after the four had told what each had heard and\r\nseen. \"Van Emmon's friend, Powart, seems to be anything but a\r\ndemocrat. He probably represents the most aristocratic element on\r\nthe planet; while this man Fort, who rescued the girl, is also\r\nprobably a member of the leisure class.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, we have Smith's agent, whose name we do not\r\nknow; he seems to be one of the working class, which Powart\r\ndespises. The two are at opposite ends of the social scale. Young\r\nErnol, whose father is in trouble, appears to be a rising young\r\nrevolutionist.\r\n\r\n\"But Mona--to use the name Powart gave his fiancee--Billie's\r\nsurgeon--the girl whose life Fort saved--she is not so easy to\r\nclassify. On the earth we would call her occupation a middle-class\r\none; but that remark she made about people being cattle gives me the\r\nimpression that she is an aristocrat at heart. I call her a mystery,\r\nfor the time being.\r\n\r\n\"As for the planet itself--of course, the people simply refer to it\r\nas the earth, or some term which translates that way to us. We need\r\na name for it. What shall we call her--this daughter of Capella's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Capellette,\" from Billie promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Fine!\" The other two looked their approval. \"Now, we are ready to\r\nanalyze things. What shall we say of her people in general?\"\r\n\r\n\"Speaking for my surgeon,\" observed Billie, \"doesn't she argue a\r\nrather high degree of development?\"\r\n\r\nThe others were plainly willing for the doctor to take the lead. He\r\nrubbed his knuckles harder than ever as he considered Billie's\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\"A higher degree of development? H-m! Not easy to say. Safer to\r\nassume that the development is higher in spots, not in general.\r\nPerhaps we'll do well to consider other things first.\r\n\r\n\"Take those two clocks, for instance. The one that I saw had a\r\npendulum of ordinary length, which vibrated twice as fast as\r\nthat\"--indicating an astronomical clock at his side. \"What about the\r\ntime-piece you saw, Van?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five-hour dial, and a pendulum of the usual length, same as\r\nyours. But--it vibrated no faster than any I ever saw before.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure?\" At the emphatic nod the doctor frowned. \"We are\r\nforced to conclude that Capellette is not as round as our earth. No\r\nother way to account for such a difference in gravitation as the two\r\nclocks indicate. Roughly, I should say that the planet's diameter,\r\nat the place where I saw the clock, is fifty per cent greater than\r\nat the point where Van's agent is located; maybe ten thousand miles\r\nin its greatest diameter, Capellette.\r\n\r\n\"Having greater gravitation would explain why that disabled aircraft\r\nwhich Smith saw fell so very slowly; the planet has much more air\r\nthan the earth, which means far greater density near the surface. It\r\nalso explains those big sailing cruisers; nothing else can.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, we can guess why we have seen no surface travel. The\r\npeople of Capellette never tried to work out such a thing as an\r\nautomobile; why should they, with the birds to imitate, and extra\r\ndense air all about them?\r\n\r\n\"I think we have found the key.\" The doctor cogitated for a second\r\nor two.\r\n\r\n\"However, let's consider that schoolroom a bit. It was in no way\r\ndifferent from what you will find on the earth right now. Why?\"\r\n\r\nSmith had a notion. \"There is such a thing as perfection. Like some\r\nelectrical apparatus; you simply can't improve them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds reasonable,\" from Van Emmon.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And that is undoubtedly how the Capellettes look at the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\"Why haven't they got talking-pictures? Because they've perfected\r\nthe silent variety, of course. Why don't they reform their ways of\r\nliving, instead of replacing a worn-out heart with a new one?\r\nThey've perfected surgery, that's why! And why haven't they tried\r\nthe screw-propeller? They've perfected the bird-wing principle!\"\r\n\r\n\"But that doesn't explain,\" objected Billie, \"why they've been\r\ncontent with an autocratic system of government.\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon considered this a dig at Powart. \"Why, of course their\r\ngovernment is autocratic, dear! How else can it be protective?\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to have a lot of admiration for your Mr. Powart,\" laying\r\nher hand on his.\r\n\r\n\"I have. He and the others seem to be highly capable fellows, who\r\nhave undertaken to maintain happiness, and have made good.\"\r\n\r\n\"But without the direct consent of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that?\" warmly. \"Most folks don't care to burden their heads\r\nwith law-making, anyhow. They'd rather leave it up to specialists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are only too willing, my dear, to handle the matter--at their\r\nown price!\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor put in hastily: \"From what you tell me, Van, this\r\ncommission determines the living conditions for the majority,\r\nalthough it has no popular authority whatever. Moreover, conditions\r\nare no better than they were a hundred years ago. There's been no\r\nprogress. Powart admits that.\r\n\r\n\"Now, placing that fact alongside the rest, I reach this conclusion:\r\nthat the people of Capallette, no matter what may have been their\r\nexperience in the past, do not now care for revolutionary ideas.\r\nThey want standardization, not change.\r\n\r\n\"It all roots back in that extra dense air of theirs. See why?\"\r\n\r\nApparently the three did not. The doctor explained: \"Life is much\r\neasier for them than for us. It is no great struggle to gain a\r\nlivelihood where transportation is so easy and simple. In\r\nconsequence of this their advancement was much more rapid than ours\r\nhere on the earth, up to a certain point; and they've reached that\r\npoint already.\r\n\r\n\"Coming back to that commission again: instead of trying out a\r\ndemocratic form of government, in which every citizen would be\r\nequally responsible regardless of property--they've standardized the\r\nprotective, paternalistic principle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is precisely the correct method!\" insisted the geologist.\r\n\"Radical changes of any kind are always dangerous. The only safe\r\nmethod is to improve what we already have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" remarked Billie--\"suppose government becomes so\r\nthoroughly standardized that it can't be improved further?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it becomes permanent.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it isn't overthrown.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor smilingly interposed. \"Let me finish and get this out of\r\nmy system. By their own confession, the commission's chief function\r\nis to keep the majority in ignorance, which is said to be the same\r\nthing as bliss. This man Ernol and his pitiful rebellion only serve\r\nto prove the rule.\r\n\r\n\"In a word, the Capellans have carried the principle of improvement,\r\nas opposed to reform, to its logical conclusion. They can go no\r\nfurther.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" challenged Van Emmon. \"Because the fittest have\r\nsurvived, on Capellette as elsewhere. These commissioners are the\r\nfittest.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded gravely. \"True enough, Van. But the point I want\r\nto make is, the commissioners have put an end to the processes of\r\nevolution. They won't allow progress. They stopped all that a\r\ncentury ago.\r\n\r\n\"Friend, Capellette is a world that has given up. It has quit!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE UPPER CRUST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next time Billie went into the tele-conscious state, forty-eight\r\nhours later, she found that she had \"arrived\" in the midst of a\r\nconversation. It told her worlds.\r\n\r\n\"I answered the telephone,\" some one was saying, \"and Mr. Powart\r\nclearly said that he would be here within the hour.\" [Footnote: The\r\nword hour is used advisedly. Of course, the Capellan hour may have\r\nan entirely different length from ours.]\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is just as well,\" answered the surgeon whom Billie now\r\nknew as Mona. \"Yes, I dare say it is quite as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any reason why he shouldn't, dear?\" inquired the other\r\nparty, a middle-aged woman, magnificently dressed, of decidedly\r\ndistinguished appearance.\r\n\r\n\"No, mother,\" replied the girl; \"not so far as he is concerned.\r\nBut--Mr. Fort also is coming to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThe older woman saw nothing alarming about this. \"I am glad to hear\r\nit. He impressed me as being a very nice boy, although rather\r\nimpulsive.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand. It's going to be very embarrassing for me.\r\nMr. Fort warned me last night--laughingly, of course, but I think he\r\nmeant it--that he intended to propose to-day.\"\r\n\r\nSwift anxiety came to the mother's face. For a while she kept\r\nsilence. And while Mona's conscious mind was occupied with thoughts\r\nwhich Billie could not fathom, her subconscious mind was faithfully\r\ntaking in all that her roving eyes beheld.\r\n\r\nThe two Capellans were seated upon the terrace of a large, handsome\r\nhouse, whose architecture Billie tentatively classified as\r\nsemi-Moorish. Mona next glanced into the grounds, telling Billie\r\nthat the house was set upon a knoll, high up on the ridge of a\r\ntremendous range of mountains. Similar houses dotted what landscape\r\nwas visible through a mass of foliage. It was just the sort of\r\nresidence colony that Billie herself would have chosen.\r\n\r\nThen the eyes came back to the mother, who was saying: \"Perhaps, my\r\ndear, you would rather that I told Mr. Fort of your engagement.\" She\r\nwatched the daughter as though expecting her to refuse the offer.\r\n\r\nWhich is just what the heart-specialist did, with a proud toss of\r\nthe head. \"Thank you; but I cannot have him think that I lack the\r\nnerve to tell him myself.\"\r\n\r\nShe excused herself and went into the house, passing through rooms\r\nso rapidly that Billie learned little, save that the place fairly\r\nswarmed with men in livery. Once in Mona's room, however, Billie\r\ndiscovered that metallic furniture was the rule; that the windows\r\nwere without screens, [Footnote: The Capellans seem to have utterly\r\nstamped out all forms of insect life except those directly\r\nbeneficial to man.] and that the bed was set down very close to the\r\nfloor. Otherwise, the room was much like any on the earth.\r\n\r\nMona's clothes interested Billie immensely. Without exception the\r\ngarments were skirtless, and a large proportion of the suits were in\r\none piece. Headgear was limited to caps, of which Mona owned an\r\nimmense variety; while she wore nothing but high lace-up boots or\r\npumps. Billie was sure that these were all of leather.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of no less than four maids, all of whom were very\r\npretty girls, Mona changed to a garment of some lustrous brown\r\nmaterial, like silk velvet but with a much longer nap, together with\r\nstockings of the golf pattern, and black pumps. Next she proceeded\r\nto inspect herself carefully in a mirror.\r\n\r\nBillie saw that Smith's estimate of \"not over thirty\" was accurate\r\nenough. The girl was still young as to face, although her body was\r\nremarkably robust. And Billie found that her delicacy of feature did\r\nnot suffer from the close-up.\r\n\r\nInstead, her refinement was made only the more striking. Probably it\r\nwas the high arching of her eyebrows that had made her face\r\npatrician; that, together with the sensitiveness of her nostrils.\r\nFor there was nothing at all cold about her eyes; they were a very\r\ndark brown, large and full. And her lips were anything but haughty;\r\nthey were a deep red and piquantly upturned at the corners. The\r\nwhole carriage of her head, however, marked her as an aristocrat,\r\nbut a lovable one.\r\n\r\nAs she turned from the glass the sound of a laugh came from the\r\nfront of the house. Billie instantly recognized Fort's voice. Mona\r\ngave her hair a final touch and went straight to the terrace.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do?\" said the surgeon coolly, as she took Fort's eagerly\r\noutstretched hand. And again Billie was more interested in the man's\r\ngray-leather flying suit, so well becoming his fine muscular\r\ndevelopment, than in the conventional reply he made. Next moment\r\nMona's mother was saying:\r\n\r\n\"I have been trying to thank Mr. Fort for what he did yesterday. It\r\nwas a remarkably brave thing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it was,\" declared Mona, with feeling. \"And yet, try as I\r\nmight last night, I was unable to make him see that it was anything\r\nout of the ordinary, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course,\" protested the athlete carelessly. \"There was\r\nnothing brave about it. One is not brave unless one is afraid; and I\r\nwasn't afraid. I can take no credit for the thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean,\" questioned Mona, \"that you are never afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not when I am in the air.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a minute, and again Billie used Mona's eyes to\r\ngood advantage. Fort was certainly a good-looking chap, although\r\nslightly untidy in small items of his costume. He was the kind which\r\nlooks best when somewhat disheveled, anyhow. As to face--a large,\r\nhandsomely curved mouth, a slightly Roman nose, eyes as big as\r\nMona's and as blue as hers were brown. Decidedly, the man was worth\r\nlooking at, again and again. Most daredevils are sharp-featured;\r\nFort was kindly. There was something positively reassuring about his\r\nkind of audacity.\r\n\r\nPresently the mother mentioned Ernol, the radical; seemingly these\r\npeople had been privately informed of what Powart was keeping from\r\nthe workers. Fort commented:\r\n\r\n\"I was really frightened when I heard of it. Why, if that fellow's\r\nphilosophy is listened to, we all may have to work for a living!\"\r\nHis laughter rang above the rest; then he thought of Mona. \"Oh, I\r\nsay, I quite forgot, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mention it,\" returned the surgeon humorously. \"I don't mind\r\ntelling you that this service of mine is largely camouflage. I\r\nbelong to the Delusion Brigade.\"\r\n\r\nFort was greatly surprised. \"You, a volunteer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. There must always be some one of our class to whom people\r\ncan look, whenever they suspect that we are not democratic. Besides,\r\nI have always fancied surgery.\" She told briefly of her work.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are a famous person!\" declared the athlete.\r\n\r\n\"You make me ashamed; I do nothing at all but amuse myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which is quite as well, Mr. Fort,\" the mother assured him. \"I tried\r\nmy best to keep Mona out of this; a social conquest is what I had\r\nplanned for her. But she had set her mind on surgery; so--\" And she\r\nleft the rest to Fort's imagination.\r\n\r\nA moment later Billie heard a flying-machine approaching. Shortly it\r\ncame near enough for her to see that it was greatly like a yacht,\r\npainted white all over, and possessing exceptionally tall masts. The\r\ncanvas was already unfurled and the vessel descending under the\r\ncontrol of some unusually powerful wings.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Powart's official boat,\" Mona explained to Fort.\r\n\r\nThe craft landed softly on the edge of the lawn, some distance away.\r\nThe three on the terrace did not stir from their places as Powart,\r\naccompanied by eight men in uniform, stepped swiftly down a short\r\nladder and strode rapidly to the house. The eight guards, each of\r\nwhom carried a brown leather box, like a motion-picture camera, took\r\nup unobtrusive positions near at hand. These cases, however, were\r\nnot used for taking photographs; Billie thought them more like some\r\nkind of condensed rapid-fire guns.\r\n\r\nBefore Powart got within ear-shot, Mona leaned toward Fort. \"This is\r\nmy fiance,\" she said with an evident effort; and when she\r\nstraightened up her hands were trembling.\r\n\r\nFort took it astonishingly well. He concealed any hint of his\r\nfeelings as the chairman was introduced. Powart gave him a single\r\npenetrating glance, then advanced in his sure, self-confident way,\r\nand took both the girl's hands in his own. She remained in her seat.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to see you looking so well. Do you feel fully\r\nrecovered, Mona?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank you,\" coolly. \"Or perhaps I should say, thanks to Mr.\r\nFort, here.\"\r\n\r\nPowart turned his keen gray eyes upon the athlete. \"If there is any\r\nway I can show you how much I appreciate this--\"\r\n\r\nFort waved his hand jauntily. \"Wait till I do something that costs\r\nme a real effort!\"\r\n\r\nSomething in his voice caught the chairman's ear. He scrutinized the\r\nathlete more closely; and Billie found herself comparing the two.\r\nThey were both big fellows; otherwise there was no resemblance. The\r\none was as dark as the other was blond; moreover, he was somewhat\r\nheavier than Fort, and of the sort which must be dressed\r\nimmaculately at all times. His good looks were due to the clean-cut\r\nlines of his face; for his eyes were stern and his mouth very\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nIf the one was impulsive, the other was sure. Fort loved to take a\r\nchance; the other, would not act until he was absolutely certain.\r\nBillie decided that he was the steadier, the more reliable of the\r\ntwo; also, the least likable, for that very reason. Infallibility is\r\na fearsome thing.\r\n\r\nThe mother arose with some remark about going into the gardens, and\r\nFort offered his arm. Powart took their going purely as a matter of\r\ncourse, and continued to stand--he seldom sat down--directly in\r\nfront of Mona.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said he in his direct fashion, \"that you can see your way\r\nclear to consider wearing this,\" and he produced a small, blue\r\nvelvet case from an inner pocket. And next moment Billie was peeking\r\nover Mona's shoulder, so to speak, to see a ring made of some\r\nmilk-white metal, set with a single oval stone of a blood-red hue.\r\nThe surgeon gave a tiny gasp at the sight of it.\r\n\r\n\"Bribery and corruption!\" she cried, and started to slip the ring on\r\nto the middle finger of her left hand. Before it was done, however,\r\nshe paused.\r\n\r\n\"I almost forgot.\" She gave Powart a sidelong glance. \"Last night I\r\nthought it over, and--Well, you know how women are about changing\r\ntheir minds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you haven't completely altered your opinion of me?\"\r\nincredulously, rather than anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No; I just want more time to think it over, that's all. It is not\r\nthat I think less of you than before, but somehow, since having such\r\na close call--I haven't quite as much confidence in my ability to\r\nmeet your expectations.\" This as though she had worded it\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\nPowart showed little concern. \"Of course I am sorry; but perhaps it\r\nis just as well. Beyond a doubt you will soon come to see it as\r\nclearly as you did the other day.\" He paused as the girl slowly\r\nextended the ring to him. \"Why not wear it anyhow, Mona?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather not--not until I am sure. It's a dreadful temptation,\r\nthough!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Powart had no choice other than to reflect her smile with one of\r\nhis own, while he quietly slipped the little case back into his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nAlmost with the same motion he took out a watch. \"You must excuse\r\nme. Business of state, as usual.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" as she rose. She gave a quick glance around, then shook\r\nher head playfully as Powart took a single eager step toward her.\r\n\"Next time,\" she said; and he bit his lip, gripped her hand tightly,\r\nand strode away. In a minute he and his guards were back in the\r\nyacht, and in three minutes out of sight.\r\n\r\nBy that time Fort and Mona's mother had returned. There was a quick\r\nexchange of glances between the two women, and then the mother\r\nexcused herself and went in the house. Fort suddenly became\r\nawkwardly self-conscious.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must be going.\" He paused; a gleam of mischief flashed into\r\nhis eyes--a kind of final come-back. \"Next time I rescue you, young\r\nlady, I shall let you get hurt ever so much worse, so that I can\r\nhave an excuse to call more than I have so far!\"\r\n\r\nHis face sobered swiftly. \"I nearly forgot. May I congratulate you\r\nupon your--engagement? Mr. Powart is a very fine man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; so he is. Really, I have lately come to wonder if I am\r\ngood enough for him.\" Then, significantly: \"The date has been\r\npostponed indefinitely. It is not impossible that I may give him\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nFort stared incredulously for a second, then saw that she meant it.\r\nThe blood rushed to his face, leaving him white and shaky with\r\nexcitement. He made a sudden move toward the girl, checking himself\r\njust as suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" His usually easy speech nearly failed him. But he laughed as\r\nboldly as ever. \"I am convinced that you are far from being a well\r\nwoman, Miss Mona! I shall have to call--often!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a short but exceedingly intense gaze of infinite meaning,\r\nhe wheeled, clapped his cap to his head, dashed to his machine and\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE STAGNANT WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith entered the mind of his Capellan agent at a moment when he was\r\nclearly off duty. In fact, the engineer of the Cobulus was at the\r\ntime enjoying an uncommonly good photoplay.\r\n\r\nSmith had arrived too late to see the beginning of the picture; but\r\nhe found it to be a more or less conventional society drama. And for\r\na while he was mainly interested in the remarkably clear\r\nphotography, the natural coloring and stereoscopic effect that the\r\ndoctor had already noted through young Ernol. Smith nearly\r\noverlooked the really fine music, all coming from a talking machine\r\nof some kind.\r\n\r\nAnd then the picture came to an end, and a farce-comedy began. It\r\nwas an extraordinarily ingenious thing, with little or no plot;\r\nafterward Smith could not describe it with any accuracy. However,\r\nMrs. Kinney, down-stairs, plainly heard him laughing as though his\r\nsides would give way.\r\n\r\nThe picture over, Smith's man got up and left the place; and once\r\noutside he glanced at his watch and took up a position on the curb,\r\nmuch as Smith had often done when a younger man. The Capellan seemed\r\nto know a good many of the people who came out of the playhouse; and\r\nmeanwhile Smith took note of something of extreme importance.\r\n\r\nThe playhouse did not have any advertising whatever in sight, except\r\nfor a single bulletin-board, like the bill of fare of a cafeteria.\r\nMoreover--and this is the significant thing--there was no\r\nbox-office, neither was any one at the door to take tickets.\r\n\r\nThe place was wide open to the world. It was located on a very busy\r\nstreet in what appeared to be a good-sized city; but, to all\r\nappearances, any one might enter who chose to.\r\n\r\n\"Free amusements,\" thought Smith, \"to keep the boobs happy.\"\r\n\r\nShortly his agent stepped down the street, which seemed to be\r\ngreatly like one in any city on the earth, except that there was\r\nremarkably little noise. Perhaps it was due to the total lack of\r\nstreet-cars and surface machinery in general. Certainly the space\r\nbetween the sidewalks was used for little else than the parking of\r\nflying-machines. The buildings housed a variety of stores, all built\r\non a large scale. There were no small shops at all.\r\n\r\nSmith's agent quickly reached his own flier, a small two-seater\r\nornithopter finished in dull gray--Smith's favorite color,\r\nincidentally--and in a minute or two he was well under way. Smith\r\nhad a chance to watch, at close range, the distorted S-motion of the\r\nmachine's wings. But the flight lasted only a few minutes, and\r\npresently the craft was again at rest.\r\n\r\nThis time it was parked under a tremendously long shed, which Smith\r\nafterward saw was really a balcony, one of a tier of ten. Opposite\r\nthe spot was a large building, like a depot; and over its roof Smith\r\nsaw the huge bulk of an airship.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, the Cobulus; and it was when Smith's agent passed\r\nthrough a checking-in room that his name was heard for the first\r\ntime. \"All right, Reblong,\" was the way it came, from the official\r\nwho punched his time-card. And Reblong, with Smith making eager use\r\nof his eyes, went directly through a hatch in the side of the great\r\nship, and thence down a corridor to his engine-room.\r\n\r\nSmith got little opportunity to study the machinery. Reblong gave\r\nthe place a single sweeping glance, then strode to a short,\r\nblack-bearded chap who stood near the instrument board.\r\n\r\n\"Everything as usual, my friend?\" He had a pleasant voice, as Smith\r\nlearned for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--as usual!\" The man's voice was bitter. \"That's just what's\r\nwrong! There's never any improvement; it's always--as usual! Say,\r\nReblong; no offense, but I think we are fools to put up with what we\r\nare given!\"\r\n\r\nSmith's man complacently seated himself in front of the instruments.\r\n\"Personally, I think we are mighty lucky, instead of foolish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky!\" The other man snorted. \"I wish Ernol could hear you say\r\nthat! He'd have a fit!\"\r\n\r\nReblong was not at all disturbed. \"By the way, what's become of the\r\nchap? I haven't seen him around for weeks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know, exactly,\" with some uneasiness. \"He went back to\r\nCalastia, and that's the last I heard of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calastia? I saw an item in the paper last night, to the effect that\r\nCalastia was under quarantine. All news cut off.\"\r\n\r\nThe man instantly smelled a mouse. \"Quarantine! Why should that\r\ncause the news to be cut off? There's something more than quarantine\r\nthe matter, Reblong!\" He began to pace the room excitedly. \"I say it\r\nagain, we're fools to believe everything the commission tells us. I\r\nthink they've been hoodwinking us about long enough!\"\r\n\r\nReblong suppressed a yawn. \"I don't care if they do, old man. I'm\r\nwilling to leave it up to them to run the government.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's exactly what's the matter!\" cried the other. \"You and\r\nevery other chap except those Ernol has taught, thinks that the\r\ncommission is God-given and can do no wrong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" politely. \"Maybe so; only, you can't blame us for thinking\r\npretty highly of a government that has done this.\" Reblong checked\r\nthe items off on his fingers, meanwhile eying his companion\r\nsteadily: \"It has done away with the liquor traffic; it has fully\r\nprotected women in industry; it has put an end to child labor; it\r\nhas abolished poverty; it has abolished war; and\"--with considerable\r\nemphasis for so quiet a man--\"it has provided you and me and\r\neverybody else with a mighty fine education, free of charge!\"\r\n\r\nReblong's manner, by its very emphasis, had the effect of making the\r\nother man suddenly quite cool. \"Correct; I admit them all. And at\r\nthe same time I want to show you that the commission has\r\naccomplished all this, not primarily for our benefit, but in the\r\ninterests of the owners.\r\n\r\n\"They gave us prohibition because drinking was bad for business; no\r\nother reason, Reblong! And that's why the women are protected, too;\r\na protected, contented woman brings in better dividends to the\r\nowners than one who is worked to death.\r\n\r\n\"Neither did it pay to allow child labor; it resulted in misery and\r\nreduced production, in the long run, and that meant reduced\r\ndividends. Poverty didn't pay, either; poor people do not make\r\nefficient workmen. War was abolished, Reblong, not for any\r\nhumanitarian motives, but because peace brought in fatter profits\r\nand less waste.\r\n\r\n\"And as for our compulsory education\"--he snapped his fingers\r\ncontemptuously--\"just what does it amount to? Simply this: it didn't\r\npay the owners to allow illiteracy! An educated workman is a better\r\ndividend-producer than an ignorant one. That's all there is to it,\r\nReblong! Don't fool yourself into thinking that the commission has\r\ndone all this for your benefit! Not much!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you're right,\" conceded Reblong. \"As for myself, I don't care\r\na rap what the commission's reasons were. I'm satisfied!\"\r\n\r\nThe other man looked disgusted. \"Satisfied! Just because you're\r\nguaranteed your dollar an hour, and your pension at sixty!\r\nSatisfied, when half the company's profits go to the owners, not one\r\nof whom ever did a bit of work in his life! A bunch of people who do\r\nnothing but blow in the money we earn, and spend more in a day than\r\nwe do in a month!\"\r\n\r\n\"They're welcome,\" commented Reblong with much indifference. \"If I\r\ngot all that you have told me is coming to me, I'd probably ruin\r\nmyself with high living anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say that you've swallowed that old piffle!\" said\r\nthe black-bearded chap incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any piffle about it. As I look at the matter, the\r\nowners are doing us a genuine favor. Not only do they take the\r\nburden of our surplus earnings off our shoulders, but they run our\r\ngovernment for us without charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be utterly damned!\" The other fellow looked as though\r\nthe words were not half strong enough. \"I never thought a full-grown\r\nman could continue to believe the stuff we were taught when we were\r\nkids! Don't you ever think for yourself, Reblong? Why, look here!\"\r\n\r\nHe came closer and spoke with painstaking clearness, as though he\r\nwere addressing a child.\r\n\r\n\"The commission, instead of assuring us that increased wages would\r\nbe our ruin, could just as well be educating us to spend wisely!\r\nJust as well, Reblong! And as for child labor--man, children ought\r\nto be kept out of industry until they're twenty, instead of sixteen!\r\nEvery last one of us ought to be given a college education, instead\r\nof merely the children of the rich! And all this could be done, too.\r\nThere's no earthly reason why we should permit that bunch of\r\nparasites in Hafen to graft off us any longer! Put 'em to work, like\r\nyou and me, and make life easier for us all!\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" objected Reblong, a little upset, \"there's only a few of the\r\nowners. They couldn't help much.\"\r\n\r\n\"But their servants could. Do you know that there's ten servants, on\r\nan average, to every family of the rich? Servants who do nothing but\r\nmake life still easier for people who already hog it all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose they did all go to work; who would run our government\r\nfor us, my friend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who! Why--if we can do the work, I guess we can certainly do the\r\ngoverning, Reblong.\"\r\n\r\nReblong turned away, plainly bewildered. \"It doesn't look right to\r\nme, old man. I'd rather let things stand as they are, so far as I'm\r\nconcerned.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhere a warning instrument was thrumming loudly. The man with\r\nthe democratic ideas automatically turned to his locker, and\r\nproceeded to change his outer clothing. Reblong meanwhile took off\r\nhis suit and slipped into some full-length overalls. As he buttoned\r\nthem up around the neck he stepped in front of a glass.\r\n\r\nSmith was nearly floored. The man was almost his exact double; an\r\nordinary, everyday sort of a chap, with a very commonplace face.\r\nPerhaps, like Smith's, his face concealed a remarkable technical\r\nknowledge; but nobody would have given him a second glance. Was he,\r\nthought Smith, a typical Capellan workman?\r\n\r\nThe other man was ready to go. He hesitated, studying the floor;\r\nthen said, regretfully:\r\n\r\n\"The worst part of it is, Reblong, everybody I talk to is as bad as\r\nyou are. They all admit that things are not what they should be--but\r\nnobody cares!\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the door, and Reblong heard him say, under his breath, as\r\nhe turned the knob:\r\n\r\n\"Great Heavens! What's come over the world anyhow? Has it gone\r\nstagnant?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nA RIPPLE IN THE POOL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though he were right. The whole great pool of humanity\r\nwhich comprised Capellette was still, quiescent, stagnant. Was there\r\nnothing to arouse it, no ripple in the pool?\r\n\r\nThe doctor had this question uppermost in his mind when he located\r\nyoung Ernol. He found him getting ready to accompany his father, who\r\nseemed about to take advantage of the freedom Powart had\r\nconditionally given him. There was no doubt about it; the radical\r\nwas going straight back to his revolutionary teaching.\r\n\r\nHe was saying, \"Of course, my boy, I can't compel you to stay at\r\nhome.\" The doctor delighted in the vigorous, frank manner and\r\npowerful voice of the man; they belonged perfectly with his black\r\nhair and bristling beard, his flashing eyes and aggressive nose.\r\n\"I'd rather you stayed out of this; at the same time, I'd be a proud\r\nman if you didn't!\"\r\n\r\nThe student calmly finished his dressing. \"What time did you tell\r\nthe men to come?\" was all he said; and the father chuckled, then\r\nsighed.\r\n\r\nThe two took flight in a small two-seater. It was night, and the\r\ndoctor took note of the planet's system of signal lights. Within\r\nfive minutes, however, the flight ended with a landing in some sort\r\nof a deep depression; the doctor called it a ravine.\r\n\r\nClimbing from the machine, the two apostles stepped a few paces in\r\ntotal darkness; then the elder man produced a small electric torch,\r\nwhich he wig-wagged above his head. There was a series of answering\r\nflashes at a distance; and next moment a door, let into the side of\r\nthe ravine, opened right in front of the pair.\r\n\r\nThey stepped in and closed the door after them, then turned their\r\nlight down a long corridor. Reaching the end of this the doctor\r\nnoted a loophole in the wall, from which projected something\r\nsuspiciously, like the muzzle of a machine gun. He had no difficulty\r\nin imagining the consequences should some one open that hidden door\r\nwithout first giving the signal.\r\n\r\nMuch as one might enter a lodge-room, the two radicals showed their\r\nfaces at a port-hole in a door, after which they passed guards with\r\nmasklike helmets. In a few seconds they found themselves in a\r\nbrilliantly lighted hall, very large and commodious except for the\r\nheavy pillars which supported its low ceiling. It was half filled\r\nwith men.\r\n\r\nThe elder Ernol had no use for formality. After brief greetings to\r\nsome kind of a committee, he took his place on a platform; while his\r\nson unconsciously gratified the doctor by looking over the crowd.\r\nPresumably they were all workers; and in one way they were all\r\nalike; the habitual contentment in their faces had been momentarily\r\nreplaced by excitement. However, they were quiet and well behaved\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\"Comrades,\" began the radical without delay, \"I appreciate your\r\ncoming here at all, under the circumstances. The commission plainly\r\nwarned me that any further teaching would be disastrous. I am not\r\nsure, but I imagine they would arrest both myself and those found\r\nwith me. If there is any one who feels that he would rather not take\r\nthe risk, now is the time for him to go.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's pause; then, in the back of the hall, two men\r\nwho had been sitting together got up and hurriedly went out. Ernol\r\nwaited, but there was no further exodus.\r\n\r\n\"I will lose no time then, but proceed to give you the proofs\r\nregarding the commission.\" He produced a small parcel of\r\nphotographs. \"These pictures are the most dangerous things I have\r\never carried on my person. I took them in the dead of night, by\r\nflashlight, in the library of the University of Calastia.\r\n\r\n\"They are\"--he paused portentously--\"reproductions of pages from the\r\nsecret census!\"\r\n\r\nTo most of the men this meant something highly significant. They\r\ncranned their necks in their excitement.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to pass them around, negatives and all. You see where I\r\nhave checked off the most important items. They prove to any one\r\nwith reason that the commission has been lying to us; that the\r\nworkers are being taxed more heavily than the owners; that the\r\nowners are being favored in every way. I don't care whether you\r\nagree with my ideas or not; these photographs\"--his voice shook the\r\nhall--\"prove that the commission is not even giving you what you\r\nthought you were getting!\"\r\n\r\nHe took a single step down from the platform, his hand outstretched,\r\nabout to pass the parcel to the man in the nearest seat. At that\r\ninstant all the lights were extinguished.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's stunned silence; then the place broke into an\r\nuproar. Yells of fright and anger, the crashing of chairs, screams\r\nof pain; all these young Ernol heard without himself giving voice.\r\nHe was sprinting down one side of the hall.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came a flash of light straight ahead. Ernol had\r\nreached the outer corridor. And the doctor heard a great commotion\r\ngoing on outside the door in the ravine; a smashing and thudding,\r\nwhich filled the corridor with noise. Next second the door gave way,\r\nand simultaneously young Ernol leaped into the niche behind the\r\nthing which the doctor thought a machine gun. Another second, and he\r\nhad the device in operation.\r\n\r\nFrom its muzzle shot a thin stream of fire, which extended the whole\r\nlength of the corridor. It lighted up everything with a bluish-white\r\nglare, revealing a mob of men at the door. They fell back, yelling\r\nwith pain, some of them dropping in their tracks. And all the while\r\nthe apparatus was dealing, not a shower of bullets, but a streak of\r\nliquid fire, which hissed and screamed like the blast from an oxygen\r\nblow-pipe.\r\n\r\nBut it was all over in a second or two. A noise from behind, and\r\nyoung Ernol started up suddenly, only to find himself in the grip of\r\na veritable giant of a man. His struggles were simply useless. In a\r\nmoment he was being carried bodily back into the hall, which the\r\ndoctor saw was now lighted as before.\r\n\r\nOn one side, lined up amid a mass of wrecked chairs, stood most of\r\nthe workers at bay. On the other were four men with small boxlike\r\ndevices, such as Billie had already seen in the hands of Powart's\r\nguards, and which were kept trained threateningly upon the crowd. On\r\nthe platform stood Ernol, now quite helpless in the grasp of two\r\nstalwart fellows.\r\n\r\nThe mob from the door poured in. Immediately they made captors of\r\nall the workers, who had precious little to say. Apparently they had\r\nbeen warned. The doctor also concluded that the capture was a piece\r\nof treachery, in which bribery had been employed.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later young Ernol was placed in a large passenger flier,\r\nwhich the doctor labeled \"Black Maria.\" Presumably the elder radical\r\nwas taken in another; at any rate after another flight in the\r\ndarkness, father and son shortly found themselves together again.\r\n\r\nThey were now in the drawing-room of some private residence,\r\nconcluded the doctor. This puzzled him somewhat until, after a brief\r\nwait under the eyes of a half-dozen guards, the two radicals were\r\ntaken into another room.\r\n\r\nHere, lying on a couch, was a man whom the doctor soon identified.\r\nHe was none other than Mona's patient, Eklan Norbith, the\r\ncommission's deputy in Calastia. He was a burly, dark-featured\r\nfellow; and even though rigid in his plaster cast, he looked\r\ncompetent and formidable.\r\n\r\n\"Ernol,\" said he in a heavy, domineering voice, \"there is no need to\r\nstate the case to a man of your intelligence. You gave your word to\r\nstop your teachings; you have been caught in the act. Frankly, I\r\nrather thought you would do it; that is why I am here to-night. I\r\nwant--to deal with you personally.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for breath, and then went on, still ignoring the student,\r\n\"Ernol, you know what I want. I want those photographs; and what is\r\nmore, I am going to have them. You must have passed them to some one\r\nwho escaped in the confusion; they have not been located on any one\r\nwho has been captured, nor were they hid in the hall. Now I will\r\ngive you exactly ten seconds [Footnote: For the sake of clearness,\r\nthe Capellan second, whose actual length is of course unknown, is\r\nused here as though it were uniform with earth standards.] to tell\r\nme what you did with them.\"\r\n\r\nHe eyed a clock on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe radical, whose hands were tied behind him, nevertheless managed\r\nto strike a defiant pose. \"I don't intend to tell you, Norbith. It\r\nis true that I handed them to one of my comrades; but I shall not\r\ntell you which one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your time is up,\" said the man with the silver heart evenly. \"Will\r\nyou tell?\"\r\n\r\nErnol contented himself with a contemptuous shake of the head. The\r\nman of the couch, for the first time conceding young Ernol's\r\npresence, now ordered him brought forward.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he told the father, \"that it would be useless to work with\r\nYOU. You are just fool enough to imagine that suffering means\r\nmartyrdom.\r\n\r\n\"But I told you that I must have those photographs. I meant it. I\r\nshall have that information if I have to torture you until I get\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go right ahead!\" taunted the revolutionist; but his face was white.\r\n\r\nNorbith turned to the boy's guards. \"Strap him into this chair!\"\r\n\r\nIt was done in half a minute. The doctor had no way of seeing how\r\nthe boy took it, except that he studiously avoided his father's\r\neyes, and that he made no sound.\r\n\r\n\"Now move him under that clock!\"\r\n\r\nOne of the guards gave a low exclamation, instantly checked at a\r\ncold stare from Norbith. And meanwhile the boy was being placed just\r\nbelow, and a little to one side of the big clock.\r\n\r\n\"Remove the lower half of the clock-case!\"\r\n\r\nIt was done in a few seconds. The instrument's pendulum now vibrated\r\nfreely in the air, its weight swinging almost to the boy's head\r\nwhere he sat.\r\n\r\n\"Move him until I drop my hand,\" said Norbith.\r\n\r\nA slight push, and instantly the doctor became aware that the heavy\r\npendulum of the clock, on reaching the outward extremity of its\r\nswing, was now gently tapping at the boy's left temple.\r\nTAP-TAP-TAP-TAP it went, with the peculiar quickness due to the\r\nplanet's powerful gravity.\r\n\r\n\"Keep him there until I tell you to move him.\"\r\n\r\nThe tapping continued. To the doctor, of course, the thing was\r\nentirely devoid of pain. It made much the same noise the dentist\r\nmakes with his mallet, only it went on and on, until perhaps two\r\nminutes had passed.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly the boy was moved away. The student said nothing; neither\r\ndid the father. Yet the doctor noticed something which meant volumes\r\nto his trained senses.\r\n\r\nThe boy's gaze was no longer clear. Instead, dancing lights appeared\r\nwherever he looked; tiny flashes of violet and orange, which\r\nshimmered before his pupils even though he closed his lids.\r\n\r\n\"Will you ask your father to tell?\" inquired Norbith.\r\n\r\n\"No--damn you!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first thing the boy had said. And it came through set\r\nteeth, in a voice which the doctor scarcely knew.\r\n\r\n\"Move him back; a little further this time.\"\r\n\r\nThe tapping began again. This time the boy's head got more of the\r\nforce of the swing; the tapping was more like a blow. THUD-THUD-THUD\r\ncame the sound now; and in a few seconds the boy could see nothing\r\nfor the shivering flames. He gave a faint groan.\r\n\r\n\"Ready to talk now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Damn you--no!\" in a voice that shook with pain.\r\n\r\n\"Move him closer!\"\r\n\r\nThe thud became a pound. The doctor looked for the skull to give way\r\nat any moment; he tried his best to control the subconscious, but\r\nthe boy's agony was too great. The dancing lights had become a\r\ncontinuous flare; the lad moaned steadily.\r\n\r\nAnd then quite without warning, the boy broke down and gave out a\r\nterrible shriek. Norbith ordered the guards to move him away from\r\nthe clock.\r\n\r\n\"Ready now?\" he inquired calmly.\r\n\r\nThe boy's answer was a snarl. \"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Once more!\"\r\n\r\nThe thud-thudding began again, and now it had a sharp sound which\r\nthe doctor instantly recognized. In a moment the boy was shaking the\r\nair with cries of such awful agony that the doctor--\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" cried the father convulsively, his face streaming with\r\ntears. \"God--the boy doesn't--know! Don't torture him--like that!\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the metal heart said:\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't do it father!\" the boy whispered through palsied lips. But no\r\nCapellan heard him.\r\n\r\nThe father was saying to Norbith, \"I gave the whole outfit to--\"\r\n\r\nAnd then that crashing and smashing came to an end. The boy had\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE DOUBLE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four felt that they understood the situation quite well, indeed.\r\nIt was really simple, this far-off world with its standardized life,\r\nthis petrified civilization in which everything was guaranteed\r\nexcept the one real essential--progress.\r\n\r\nBut what was Fort going to do about it? Billie was not the only one\r\nwho was interested; Van Emmon was equally curious, and Smith\r\nprivately believed that the geologist was slightly jealous of the\r\ndistant athlete. Certainly he was as eager as any one to continue\r\nthe investigation, and stoutly defended Powart against any\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\n\"He's the right man in the right place!\" he insisted. \"Lord, I wish\r\nI was in his boots!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm rather thankful you're not, dear,\" commented Billie with\r\na look which quickly brought an answering light to his eyes. Yet,\r\nbehind her remark there was a certain wistfulness which the doctor\r\ndid not overlook.\r\n\r\nYes, the four felt that they were very well acquainted with\r\nCapellette.\r\n\r\nBut the most amazing part of the whole proposition was yet to be\r\ndiscovered. It was not until after nearly two weeks of daily\r\ninvestigation, in fact, that the whole astonishing truth of the\r\nmatter was uncovered.\r\n\r\nIt came through Billie. Fort was now calling regularly at Mona's\r\nhouse, evidently trying his best to understand the girl and make\r\nhimself understood; for he said not a word about his suit. And one\r\nday he suggested that they make a much longer flight than any they\r\nhad so far taken together.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't been down into the contact for a long while. Have you?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the two set out, Billie wondering mightily what \"the contact\"\r\nmight be. They flew for several hours in a direction which would\r\nhave been called \"westerly\" on the earth; and during the time they\r\nwere above land, Billie saw no sign of factories, farms, or other\r\nforms of industry. In fact, hill and valley alike were laid out with\r\nhandsome residences, beautifully kept grounds, vast parks and\r\nextensive greens, suggesting golf. That was all.\r\n\r\nThen she noticed something that made her marvel. The sun, which had\r\nstood directly overhead when they left the house, within less than\r\nthree hours began to descend with increasing rapidity; so that in\r\nhalf the length of an ordinary afternoon it had approached to within\r\nan hour of setting. Its motion was so rapid that it could almost be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nSoon Billie concluded that the two fliers were bound for the bottom\r\nof some unusually wide and exceptionally deep canon. She tried to\r\nremember what she had read of the earth's greatest chasms; was it\r\npossible for the sun to disappear in mid-afternoon in such? And yet\r\nthe flight went on and on, until Billie began to wonder if a chasm\r\ncould be a hundred miles deep.\r\n\r\nSoon she could dimly discern the dark mass of the opposite side. The\r\nfliers were steadily approaching this, and all the time going deeper\r\nand deeper. Once Mona turned her eyes searching to the right and\r\nleft; whereupon Billie was still further mystified to see that,\r\nalthough the cleft was fifty or sixty miles in length, yet its\r\nextreme ends seemed entirely open to the world. Nothing but a deep\r\n\"V\" of blue sky was to be seen in either direction.\r\n\r\nThe sun disappeared altogether. Always the two walls grew closer and\r\ncloser together, until at last Billie could see, despite the\r\nsemidarkness, a heavy growth of vegetation on the opposite wall.\r\nBeneath her, as well, the surface was densely wooded.\r\n\r\nStill they descended! It was unbelievable; surely the chasm did not\r\nextend right into the heart of the globe. They had been flying for\r\nhours!\r\n\r\nAt last came a time when the far wall of the cleft was so near that\r\nBillie could have shot a deer upon it. She estimated the distance at\r\ntwo hundred yards; and then, and not until then, did she realize\r\nthat Mona, in order to inspect this bank, was now LOOKING up. The\r\nwall which had seemed right ahead, all along, was now actually\r\noverhead!\r\n\r\nWere they entering some sort of a cave? If so, it had dimensions\r\nthat staggered the imagination. What was more, if it were a cave,\r\nhow could the mind of man account for vegetation on its roof?\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes Fort called from his machine; whereupon Mona\r\nlocated a landing-place, a small clearing dimly visible in the\r\ndistance. The opposite wall of the chasm--or the roof of the cave,\r\nwhichever it was--now approached to within five yards of the tops of\r\nthe two machines. Mona and the athlete stepped out, and looked\r\naround.\r\n\r\nBillie's senses swam. This clearing, as has been said, was only a\r\nfew yards away from the tops of the bushes on the roof. Moreover,\r\nall this vegetation, instead of growing at right angles from the\r\nsurface in the usual way, was all lying flat against the soil, and\r\nall pointing in one direction--back, the way they had come!\r\n\r\nThe sky was not overhead any longer; it was a mere strip of very\r\ndark blue, lying far off on the horizon. That is, to the right; on\r\nthe left, the cavelike cleft extended still further, its limits\r\nshrouded in darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Queer, isn't it?\" laughed Fort. \"Shall we walk around?\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the two young people set out on a narrow, but much worn\r\ntrail. Keeping the sky always at their right, they passed through\r\nthe thicket, Mona's eyes telling Billie that the queer horizontal\r\nvegetation grew always toward the light.\r\n\r\nIt was much like the growth at the bottom of any gulch; only the two\r\nwere walking in the normal way, upright, at right angles to the\r\nsurface, quite as though it were level ground!\r\n\r\nOverhead the thicket grew in the same fashion; Billie thought the\r\nfoliage much like ferns. Here and there, however, was a small\r\nflowering shrub; and it was to one of these that a tiny,\r\norange-colored bird came flying.\r\n\r\nAnd Billie wondered why Mona did not gasp in astonishment. For the\r\nbird, when it alighted upon the shrub, was not over eight feet above\r\nMona's eyes; and unless there was something decidedly wrong with the\r\ngirl's vision, the bird had alighted upside down!\r\n\r\nThere it clung, chirping flatly, moving its head from side to side\r\nand watching the two with bright, unfrightened eyes. But Mona was\r\nnot much interested; she and Fort moved on. And shortly Billie was\r\ngazing at a fresh wonder.\r\n\r\nDirectly opposite them, on what Billie was now calling the roof,\r\ninstead of the wall, there appeared a deep furrow in the ferns. She\r\nsaw that it was a path, much like the one Mona was treading; it\r\nmeandered in and out of sight from time to time. What was the\r\nmeaning of it? Billie began to wonder if \"the contact\" was the name\r\nof some mechanical illusion, like a distorted mirror.\r\n\r\nThe two had been walking for nearly an hour when, right ahead of\r\nthem, the thicket opened up, and another clearing presented itself.\r\nThat is, Billie called it another clearing, until she looked more\r\nclosely and made out two flying-machines in it. They were the ones\r\nthe pair had come in!\r\n\r\nNow Billie was positive that they had not turned around in their\r\nwalk; they had kept the sky on their right all the while. In fact,\r\nthe sky was still on that side. They were approaching the clearing\r\nfrom the side opposite the one they had gone out from!\r\n\r\nYet, neither the athlete nor the surgeon seemed to see anything\r\npeculiar in the fact. Instead, they looked at one another as much as\r\nto say, \"Well, time to go, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nThen Fort stared up at the mysterious roof. There was another\r\nclearing there, a little to one side; which accounted for Billie's\r\noverlooking it at first. Fort led the way over opposite.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we try it?\" he dared Mona.\r\n\r\n\"You first,\" she replied, indifferently.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the athlete, without another word, pulled his cap down\r\ntight, made sure his pockets were buttoned, cleared the shrubbery\r\naway from his feet and--leaped! Leaped straight into the air, and as\r\nhe went up, he flipped his body as only an acrobat can, so that he\r\nturned a mid air somersault.\r\n\r\nBut he did not come back to where he jumped from. Instead, his jump\r\ntook him five yards, which separated the ground from the roof; and\r\nwhen he landed HIS FEET WERE RESTING ON THE ROOF, AND HIS HEAD WAS\r\nPOINTING DOWNWARD, TOWARD MONA.\r\n\r\n\"It's easy,\" he remarked, craning his neck so that he could look at\r\nthe girl. \"Come on; I'll catch you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Billie's senses whirled as the surgeon duplicated the feat.\r\nNext second Mona was standing beside Fort, five yards above the spot\r\nshe had just left; and in that second everything had become\r\nprecisely reversed; the two were now looking up! Looking up, to\r\nbehold their machines, apparently upside down, just over their\r\nheads!\r\n\r\nAs though this were not enough, Mona picked a leaf from a shrub and\r\nthrew it some seven or eight feet up. It remained motionless in mid\r\nair!\r\n\r\nIt was too much for Billie. She felt that she could not contemplate\r\nthe thing any longer with safety to her sanity. She exerted her\r\nwill, and broke the connection with Mona; so that a few minutes\r\nlater her three friends on the earth were listening to her account.\r\n\r\nThe doctor waited until she was all through; then, \"While you were\r\nhaving that experience I was in touch with young Ernol again. The\r\nboy has recovered and is still in jail, but they let him have his\r\nbooks now. And I've been helping him study geography.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Very simple. Capellete is a double world!\"\r\n\r\n\"Double!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! There are two globes, instead of one. They're twins, and\r\nSiamese twins at that!\" He drew a figure on his knee, thus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: two circles touching each other]\r\n\r\n\"Just imagine the earth and Venus of the same size, and so near to\r\none another that their combined gravity has brought them together!\r\nThat's Capellette! And the contact is the place where they touch!\"\r\n\r\nThey considered this in wondering silence for a while. Then the\r\ndoctor continued:\r\n\r\n\"It's just as we had deduced; each of the planets is larger than the\r\nearth. I saw the figures in that geography.\r\n\r\n\"But astronomically they are one. They revolve around Capella\r\ntogether; the rotate about a common center daily, just as the earth\r\nrotates on its axis. This common center is, of course, in the\r\ncontact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are both globes inhabited?\" Billie was greatly interested.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. All parts of both planets are developed to the same extent,\r\nand evenly settled. They are just one great nation, with a common\r\nlanguage. This, of course, is traceable to the great density of the\r\nair, enabling the people to fly wherever they wanted to go. There\r\nnever has been such a thing as an 'Old World' and a 'New World' with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"The really remarkable fact, however, Billie has already hinted at.\r\nThe country near Mona's home shows no sign of industry; there's\r\nnothing but parks and magnificent estates. And the geography\r\nexplains it all. One of the planets is devoted entirely to industry\r\nand the homes of those who are engaged therein; the workers inhabit\r\nthat globe exclusively. There are about ten billion of them.\r\n\r\n\"The other globe is exclusively a residence tract, set aside for the\r\nhomes of the rich; what they call the owners. There is no industry\r\nof any kind. No workers live there, excepting the army of servants\r\nand park attendants which the owners need for their own comfort. The\r\npopulation is about a hundred million, of which only one in ten is a\r\ncapitalist. The rest are serving people.\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon seemed to feel that it was his place to comment. \"In other\r\nwords, Newport on a grand scale!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that the way Powart seems to regard it?\" from Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Apparently. There were a lot of things in his talk which I couldn't\r\nunderstand until now; but it's clear enough--the doctor's right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" pursed the girl deliberately, \"the Capellans have divided\r\nthe world between them, so that the working classes inhabit\r\none-half, and the capitalists the other?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor explained that the dividing was all done by the owners.\r\n\"Every bit of the land on the residence planet is privately owned,\r\nwith the exception of certain small amusement tracts. Theoretically,\r\nthe planet is open to one and all; practically no worker is welcome\r\nthere for more than a few hours, and then only in one of those\r\nparks. There is no hotel.\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon was straining his memory. \"Let's see--I heard Powart name\r\nthe place. He called it--called it--Hafen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. And the other--the world which is the home of the working\r\npeople, but which they do not own; the world whose factories and\r\nfarms provide a standard living for the workers and lives of luxury\r\nfor the owners--this world is known as Holl. But if I read young\r\nErnol's mind aright, these words mean nothing more or less\r\nthan--Heaven and hell!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nCAUSE AND EFFECT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that time on the four did not hold any more formal discussions\r\nof what they learned. This was due to a most extraordinary\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nThey found that they could keep in touch with each other while they\r\nwere \"visiting\"! It was a tremendous help; it enabled them to\r\ncommunicate and compare notes as they went along. The doctor\r\ndeclared that the Venusians themselves had not been able to do more.\r\n\r\nThus, when Powart called on Mona a few days after she had declined\r\nhis ring, Billie was able to tell the other three all that took\r\nplace, as fast as it happened. As usual, Powart's stay was a brief\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you have recovered your former self-confidence,\" said he,\r\nconsciously repressing the masterful note in his voice. \"Not that I\r\nam unwilling to wait, Mona.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very patient,\" she assured him. \"I am glad to say that I am\r\nno longer troubled with any doubts of myself. Something else worries\r\nme now.\"\r\n\r\nHe frowned at the implication. \"What is it?\" coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Frankly, it is your record.\" She knew she was jarring him terribly,\r\nbut she went on with evident relish, \"You are the most important man\r\nin the world. Odd, isn't it, that I should find fault with that? But\r\nit is a serious objection. You are still a very young man; you have\r\nbecome one of the commission; for a year, you are its head. The\r\npoint is, what's before you?\" She paused to let this take effect.\r\n\"You've already accomplished all that any man can possible\r\naccomplish in the political field. You haven't any future!\"\r\n\r\nPowart grasped the thought with his usual instant decision. \"I\r\nunderstand. You are right, too. I had not thought of it before.\" A\r\nslight pause. \"You fear that you may come to tire of me; is that\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded emphatically. \"If you had asked me a few years ago,\r\nbefore you had reached the top--it would have been different.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained standing, frowning hard. Presently he glanced at his\r\nwatch, and said he would have to be going.\r\n\r\n\"I will see what can be done about it,\" he stated. \"I have a plan\r\nwhich should get results.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to take up a hobby?\" eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Not a new one; but a hobby I have always had.\" And with this\r\nenigmatic reply he was off.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon kept track of his further movements, and reported\r\neverything to the other three. Powart had not been in flight long\r\nbefore he sent off a wireless despatch, to which he received a most\r\nextraordinary reply. It was from the expedition which he had sent to\r\nAlma a week before:\r\n\r\nPeople of Alma give us warm welcome. Invite us to stay. We propose\r\nto do so. The planet infinitely preferable to either Hafen or Holl.\r\nAccept our resignations or not, as you please, and be damned to you!\r\n\r\nPowart made no comment upon this, which he read in privacy after\r\ncarefully decoding it. Van Emmon had no idea what he was thinking,\r\nof course, but wondered mightily how the chairman was going to deal\r\nwith the situation. He could scarcely read that aerogram to the\r\ncommission. For some time he paced the cabin of his yacht, and at\r\nthe end he behaved like a man whose mind had been pretty strongly\r\nmade up.\r\n\r\nThe commission met, it seems, in a central part of Hafen. Powart\r\nreached the place some hours after leaving Mona. He arrived to find\r\nthe other nine members waiting for him; and without the least delay\r\nhe took his place at the head of the table.\r\n\r\n\"We will postpone the usual routine until the next session if you\r\nlike,\" said he. There was no objection; whereupon Powart produced a\r\nmessage from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"You will recall the expedition to Alma. I have just received their\r\nfirst report since reaching the planet.\" And then, to the vast\r\namazement of the people on the earth, he read--not what Van Emmon\r\nhad seen him receive, but this, in his strong, matter-of-fact voice:\r\n\r\n\"People of Alma facing starvation, due to overpopulation and\r\nland-exhaustion. Have disabled our boat and will not permit us to\r\nreturn, although allowing us to use wireless, which they do not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n\"They are constructing a fleet of huge space-boats, all heavily\r\narmed, intending to cross over to Hafen and Holl, and conquer the\r\nCapellans.\"\r\n\r\nPowart glanced keenly around the table. \"This is all that has been\r\nreceived. Evidently our men were prevented from sending any more. I\r\nexpect nothing further. It remains for us to decide, at once, what\r\nwe should do.\"\r\n\r\nThe silence of the next few minutes was largely due to\r\nconsternation. To most of the commissioners the problem was\r\nstaggering. They looked up in eager relief as the shock-headed man\r\nbroke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that war is not inevitable. Apparently the thing\r\nthat Alma needs is food. We still have a good deal of underdeveloped\r\nland on Holl; why not make a bargain with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean present them with enough land to raise the food they\r\nneed?\" from the former chairman.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in exchange for whatever manufactured goods they can supply,\r\nand which we need. I see no reason for an invasion.\"\r\n\r\nPowart coughed slightly. \"I do. We must not think that Alma is the\r\nsame sort of a world as ours. It is a much older planet, and\r\nsomewhat smaller. Yet it is more than eight times as densely\r\npopulated as Holl. What land we could spare would be only a fraction\r\nof what they need. They intend not merely to invade and conquer us,\r\nbut to destroy us just as we destroyed the Ammians!\" [Footnote:\r\nDoubtless referring to some aboriginal tribe or race, such as the\r\nIndians of America.]\r\n\r\nThe nine sat for an instant in stunned silence at this amazing\r\nfabrication. Then the big man with the aggressive face leaped to his\r\nfeet, brought his fist down upon the table with a thump, and\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, if it's war, it's war!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye!\" cried Powart's uncle; and in a flash the whole council was on\r\nits feet. \"War be it!\" they shouted.\r\n\r\nIn another moment the excitement had abated as suddenly as it had\r\narisen. They got back into their seats, looking slightly abashed.\r\nPowart still remained standing.\r\n\r\n\"Then the only question is, shall we make preparations at once, or\r\nwait until we have thought the matter over further?\" His tone was\r\none of scientific indifference; and the discussion of the next few\r\nminutes was all in favor of his scheme. It ended in a motion to\r\nresolve the commission into a ways and means committee for the\r\npurpose of common defense.\r\n\r\n\"Second the motion!\" cried the aggressive man; and the response was\r\nunanimous. Powart directed that a memorandum be made of the vote;\r\nthen pressed one of a row of pushbuttons at his hand. An attendant\r\nimmediately entered.\r\n\r\n\"Bring File 6, Folio 1,164, Sheet 10,\" ordered Powart with his usual\r\ndecisive exactness. The attendant disappeared, and in less than a\r\nminute returned with a large sheet of parchment. Powart immediately\r\nlocated the passage he desired.\r\n\r\n\"The action you have just taken,\" he stated, \"amounts to a\r\ndeclaration that a state of war exists. Under such circumstances,\r\nthe law explicitly states the function of the chair. Read!\" and he\r\nhanded the parchment to the nearest commissioner. Within ten minutes\r\nthe law had been read by every man present. Powart instantly\r\ncontinued with his statement:\r\n\r\n\"This commission is hereby automatically converted into a general\r\nstaff, with myself, the chairman, as supreme commander. Your\r\nfunctions, while this state of war endures, will consist partly in\r\nproposing what steps I shall take, partly, in advising me regarding\r\nmy decisions, and partly in carrying out whatever orders I may\r\ngive.\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed another button, and when the attendant responded, Powart\r\nmade a signal with his hand. The attendant turned on his heel,\r\nsaluting, faced the door he had left open behind him, and ordered:\r\n\r\n\"In single file--march!\"\r\n\r\nA company of guards trooped straight into the hall, and formed a\r\nhollow square about the table. The nine men stared at Powart in\r\nastonishment and perplexity. He did not keep them waiting.\r\n\r\n\"Pursuant to the authority vested in me by these acts, I hereby\r\ndeclare that a state of war exists between us and the people of\r\nAlma. I also declare the International Commission dissolved as such;\r\nthe same is now my general staff, and will remain where it now\r\nis--indefinitely!\"\r\n\r\nThe nine looked at each other blankly. Were they under arrest?\r\n\r\n\"And further, I hereby declare that martial law now exists\r\nthroughout all the domain formerly under the rule of the commission!\r\nUntil peace is declared, my word\"--he paused ominously--\"is the sole\r\nand only lawl\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE REBEL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Billie was still \"haunting\" Mona, and shortly was able to\r\ntell the other three that Fort had called, taking the surgeon out in\r\na machine large enough to hold them both. They proceeded to a\r\nnear-by park, where a game of aerial punt-ball was already in\r\nprogress. [Footnote: The game is described more or less completely\r\nin various sporting publications.]\r\n\r\nBillie took great interest in the darting play of the little flylike\r\nmachines, the action of the mechanical catapults, and the ease with\r\nwhich the twelve-inch ball was usually caught in the baskets on the\r\nmachines' prows. She reported the score from time to time in a\r\nmanner which would have made a telegrapher jealous.\r\n\r\nReturning from the game, Mona and Fort became pretty confidential,\r\nthe natural result of a common enthusiasm; for their side won. But\r\nFort was content for a while to merely watch Mona, who was driving.\r\n\r\nFinally the conversation made an opening for him to say, \"I asked\r\nyour mother, Mona, what she thought of me as a prospective\r\nson-in-law.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was in no way rattled. \"I suppose she told you that it\r\nwouldn't make any difference what she might say; I'd do as I pleased\r\nanyhow. Didn't she?\"\r\n\r\nFort nodded, slightly taken back. Then his boldness returned. \"Well,\r\nI had to bring up the subject somehow. And now that I've done it--do\r\nyou love me well enough to marry me, Mona?\"\r\n\r\nShe pretended to be very busy with the driving; so that Billie never\r\nknew whether Fort looked anxious or not. Presently Mona said:\r\n\r\n\"I think--I rather think I like you too well to marry you. What I\r\nmean is, I'm afraid it would spoil you, my dear boy. You're too well\r\nsatisfied with yourself. I don't want to marry a man who is content\r\nto fly around half the time and admire me the other half; although,\"\r\nshe added, \"I like to be admired as well as any one.\"\r\n\r\nFort looked as though he would, with an ounce more provocation, take\r\nher in his arms and say something to get quick results. But he\r\ndidn't. \"I see,\" pretty soberly, for him. \"You want me to get in and\r\ndo something important. Like Powart?\" suddenly.\r\n\r\nBut Mona would not answer him directly. \"It's only fair to say that\r\nI've given him an ultimatum, too.\" She hinted at what she had told\r\nthe chairman. \"I said nothing about--you.\"\r\n\r\nFort took a deep breath. Mona gave him a glance or two, and Billie\r\ncould see a startling change come over him. It was amazing; Fort,\r\nfor the first time in his life had made a serious resolve!\r\n\r\n\"This makes everything very different!\" he declared; and even his\r\nvoice was altered. There was a determined, purposeful ring about it\r\nwhich was altogether unlike his usual reckless tones.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for not telling Mr. Powart,\" Fort went on in the same quiet\r\nway. \"Clearly, I should tell him myself. And I shall. After that it\r\nis up to me!\"\r\n\r\nNext instant he had thrown off his seriousness, and for the\r\nremainder of the flight was his former jovial self. He seemed a\r\ntrifle ashamed, however, of his old lightheartedness; so much so\r\nthat Mona warned him not to tamper too much with his disposition. \"I\r\nlike it too well, boy.\"\r\n\r\nHe went straight home after a hurried leave-taking, and Mona did not\r\nsee him again until after the declaration of war. The next the four\r\nheard of him was through Van Emmon; Fort called upon the self-made\r\ncommander-in-chief as quickly as he could.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to inform you,\" said Fort, coming straight to the\r\npoint, \"that Miss Mona has seen fit to encourage my suit. In short,\r\nsir,\" with the strange new note of resolution in his voice, \"I am\r\nyour rival for her hand! I thought it only right that you should\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nPowart took this as he took everything, standing. And Van Emmon\r\ncould see no sign that the announcement had disturbed his poise.\r\n\r\n\"You are considerate,\" he stated with the faintest trace of sarcasm.\r\n\"Let me call your attention to the fact that, because of the\r\nposition which recent events have forced upon me, it is quite within\r\nmy power to dispose of your opposition\"--significantly.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so! I shall appreciate your consideration also.\" Then the\r\nathlete permitted himself a slight smile. \"On second thoughts,\r\nhowever, you can't afford to be other than considerate. If anything\r\nhappens to me now, Miss Mona will naturally think of you; for she\r\nknows I have come here!\"\r\n\r\nA single exclamation escaped Powart, and from the light in Fort's\r\neyes, Van Emmon knew that the chief was sorely provoked. However, he\r\nspoke with his usual coolness and certainty.\r\n\r\n\"Under the circumstances, you will be exempt, Mr. Fort, from the\r\nconscription which is now under way. I shall do nothing that might\r\nhinder your activities in any way? I take it\"--evenly--\"that you\r\nhope to accomplish something--big?\"\r\n\r\nFort bowed. \"It is my intention to set a mark even further than your\r\nown, sir!\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time Powart laughed. It was a really hearty laugh, as\r\nthough Fort's preposterous boast was so utterly ridiculous that\r\nsarcasm was out of place.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fort\"--when his mirth had subsided--\"I only wish your judgment\r\nwas as sound as your optimism! Tell me--do you intend to make\r\nyourself ruler of a bigger world than this?\"\r\n\r\nFort dropped his seriousness for an instant. \"To tell the truth,\r\nPowart, I haven't any plan at all--yet. Thanks for the exemption. In\r\nreturn, I assure you that whatever I do will be as truly in the\r\ninterests of the people as what you have done.\"\r\n\r\nPowart eyed him keenly. For a moment Van Emmon thought he would try\r\nto learn if Fort had any suspicions. But he said nothing further\r\nthan a curt, \"The audience is ended.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later Billie, through Mona, knew that Fort was\r\nreporting progress. He did it by telephone.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you'd like to know,\" he finished. \"Hope I didn't rouse you\r\nout of bed.\"\r\n\r\nIt was night in Mona's part of the world, and Billie had come upon\r\nthe girl just as she was preparing for bed.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said, through a tremendous yawn. \"I was just about\r\nto retire. Good luck\"--another yawn--\"and good--\"\r\n\r\nHer voice changed. \"Mr. Fort!\" sharply. \"Powart's declaration of war\r\non Alma is a frame-up! Never mind how I happen to know; it is true;\r\nthey are not planning to invade us at all! He trumped up this affair\r\nin order to make himself dictator!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" The athlete was astounded. \"Are you sure of this, Mona?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's manner had changed again. \"I beg your pardon?\" she\r\ninquired, vastly confused. \"Did I say something that--why, I am not\r\naware, Mr. Fort, that I had said anything more than 'good night'!\"\r\n\r\n\"You AREN'T!\" His voice was strained and excited. \"Mona--you just now\r\nsaid something of the most extraordinary--surely--incredulously--you\r\nrecall saying something, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nShe was still bewildered. \"I do not!\" Then gathering her poise\r\nagain, \"What did I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said--\" He stopped and waited a long while before going on.\r\nThen he stated with a soberness that was almost stern:\r\n\r\n\"Mona, you told me something which could have come only through a\r\nsupernatural agency. I am sure of it, from your manner. You were\r\ntemporarily possessed.\" He paused again.\r\n\r\nShe sensed his earnestness, and spoke just as seriously. \"It is not\r\nimpossible. I have heard of such things before. I was sleepy,\r\nand--the point is, what did I say?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I do not intend to tell--you. What I learned gives me a great\r\nadvantage over Powart; that's all I can say. More would be\r\ndishonorable. Will you take my word for that, Mona?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" with swift decision, and a grace that Billie envied.\r\nWhereupon she went to bed, but not to sleep until after many an hour\r\nof wide-eyed wondering.\r\n\r\nFort next showed himself to Smith, through Reblong. He had secured a\r\npass to the engine-room of the Cobulus; and shortly his breezy\r\nmanner completely broke down the engineer's usual reserve.\r\n\r\n\"Always glad to show the machinery,\" said Reblong, denying that the\r\nvisitor was making any trouble. Fort's technical knowledge had\r\ndelighted him. \"Come again any time you like.\"\r\n\r\nWhich Fort did, the very next day. And this time he brought a\r\npackage of sweetmeats, during the eating of which the two men became\r\npretty friendly.\r\n\r\n\"You're different from most of the folks of your--station,\" Reblong\r\nfinally made bold to remark. \"Any harm in my saying so?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" laughed the athlete. \"I rather pride myself on my\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, I want you to tell me a few things about your\r\nfellow-workers. I understand you're one of the officers of your\r\nguild?\"\r\n\r\n\"Secretary,\" replied Reblong, a little dubiously. Was Fort a secret\r\ninvestigator?\r\n\r\n\"Then you can tell me. Is there any dissatisfaction? Are the men\r\nentirely content with their treatment?\"\r\n\r\nReblong hesitated about replying, and Fort assured him, \"This is a\r\npurely personal matter with me, old man. I am really anxious to know\r\nwhether the working world is as well satisfied, as happy as I am.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus Fort discovered, just as another man had already\r\ndiscovered, that the average Capellan workman was entirely satisfied\r\nwith what he knew to be unjust treatment. Even when Fort told\r\nReblong what he had learned about Powart's trickery--leaving out all\r\ndetails about Mona, of course--the engineer would not listen to any\r\nhint of revolution.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like to question your word, Mr. Fort\"--Reblong was very\r\nuncomfortable--\"but I have such confidence in the commission\r\nthat--well, you understand.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Fort said, just as the other fellow had said after talking with\r\nReblong--Reblong, the representative Capellan workman; Reblong, who\r\nvoiced the opinions of his billions of fellow-workmen when he\r\nrefused to consider a rebellion--Fort said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be utterly damned!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nUNDER MARTIAL LAW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVan Emmon was pretty cross because Billie, through Mona, had told\r\nFort about Powart's game. More than once he protested hotly, \"You\r\nshouldn't have done that! It's all their affair, not ours!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Billie usually returned, just as warmly, \"I don't care! I think\r\nPowart is a scoundrel!\" And it was in the midst of one of these\r\ntiffs that the doctor interrupted, exactly as though the telepathy\r\nwas telephony:\r\n\r\n\"Quiet, you two. Fort has called at the prison, and is being\r\nintroduced to young Ernol. He--\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been talking with your father,\" Fort was saying to the son.\r\nThe guard had left them alone in the cell. \"But he isn't interested\r\nin my ideas. He seems to think he's done all that needs to be done\r\nin getting himself imprisoned.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy nodded. \"He considers himself a martyr, Mr. Fort; and I\r\nguess he's satisfied like everybody else.\" He spoke bitterly.\r\n\r\nAll Fort's own youthful enthusiasm returned with a rush. \"You're\r\njust the chap I'm looking for! If you're genuinely ambitious to do\r\nthe people a great service, now's your chance!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went on to tell the boy about Powart's frame-up. He gave\r\nevery detail of Mona's strange disclosure, and the boy believed him\r\nabsolutely.\r\n\r\n\"I might have known there was some trick about it!\" cried the lad.\r\n\"Alma isn't that kind of a planet! By Heaven, Powart deserves to be\r\nassassinated!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing doing,\" replied the athlete promptly, his eyes sparkling\r\nwith the old light. \"The first thing is to get you out of here; you,\r\nand the other hundred and fifty who were put in at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon he proceeded to outline a scheme such as would look\r\nutterly incredible in the mere planning. Perhaps it is best to\r\nrelate the thing as it happened, instead.\r\n\r\nTwo nights after Fort's call on Ernol, Fort again presented himself\r\nto Reblong. This time it was at the engineer's apartments.\r\n\r\n\"I was hoping to find you about to go on duty. I've been wondering\r\nhow your engines control the steering.\" He was eying Reblong\r\nsteadily. \"Some time when it is convenient I wish you would show me\r\nall over the ship, and explain everything.\" He turned as though to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right, Mr. Fort,\" Reblong hurried to assure him.\r\n\"I'd just as soon accommodate you right now as at any time. The ship\r\nis always open to me.\"\r\n\r\nReblong had said exactly what Fort had hoped and planned that he\r\nwould say. Fifteen minutes later the two men were inside the big\r\nair-cruiser, alone except for a few cleaners, who were finishing the\r\nusual work of preparing the ship for its next cruise. But Reblong\r\ncould not know that Fort had carefully made sure of this fact\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\nThe engineer took the athlete from one end of the cruiser to the\r\nother, showing him how the pilot was able to control its motions\r\nwith the utmost delicacy, thanks to automatic mechanism in the\r\nengine-room, electrically connected with the bridge.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I was the pilot now,\" commented Fort, standing on the\r\nbridge and looking up at the stars. \"All I need to do is to set\r\nthese dials\"--indicating the pilot's instruments--\"to 'ascend,' and\r\nthe engine-room would do the rest automatically. Is that it?\"\r\n\r\nReblong said this was practically true, and led the way back to the\r\nengine-room. The place was full of a gurgling sound, now, due to the\r\nfuel being run into the tanks. Reblong glanced at the indicating\r\ntube. \"We've already got enough,\" he estimated, \"to take the ship a\r\nthousand miles.\"\r\n\r\nAnd next instant Fort had leaped upon him. Reblong staggered back in\r\nhis surprise, stumbled against a chair, and sat down heavily,\r\nhelpless as a child in the athlete's iron grip.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, old man,\" remarked Fort, meanwhile pushing him, chair and\r\nall, toward the instrument-table. \"But it's simply got to be done.\"\r\nLike a flash he let go the engineer and snatched a strap from the\r\ntable--where he had of course previously placed it--and again threw\r\nhimself upon his man before Reblong recovered from his surprise. In\r\na second he was strapped tight in his chair; and not until then did\r\nhe think to use his feet. Another strap put an end to his kicking.\r\n\r\n\"Surprised you, didn't I?\" The athlete was enjoying himself hugely.\r\n\"Now--I must remind you that I'm taking a big chance in doing this.\r\nIf you make a noise, I shall treat you as any desperate man would\r\ntreat you!\" There was a look in his eyes which clinched the matter.\r\n\r\nImmediately he disappeared in the direction of the nearest cleaners.\r\nReblong heard sounds of struggling from time to time; and evidently\r\nhe implicitly believed that Fort would take vengeance upon him if he\r\ncalled for help; for he kept perfectly quiet. After perhaps twenty\r\nminutes the athlete returned, breathing heavily, but happy.\r\n\r\n\"The last one almost spilled my beans,\" said he--to use the\r\nexpression Smith employed. \"He happened to see me shutting another\r\none into a closet, and jumped me from behind. I had to lay him out.\"\r\nReblong must have looked alarmed. \"Oh, no harm done. They'll all\r\nlive to tell about it for the next twenty years.\"\r\n\r\nNext he made certain adjustments in the engine-room mechanism. Then\r\nhe went to the telephone, and located the man in charge of the\r\ndepot. \"Hello--Mr. Fort speaking; Reblong isn't able to come to the\r\nphone.\" He winked at the man in the chair. \"There's something wrong\r\nwith the fuel indicator. Shut off the supply for a while, will you?\"\r\n\r\nThe gurgling soon stopped. Reblong watched in continued silence as\r\nFort disappeared again, this time taking the elevator to the bridge.\r\nHe was back again in a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, old man,\" addressing the engineer, \"you can guess what I'm up\r\nto. I'm going to navigate this cruiser alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've set everything for the ascent. You see what I've done; if I've\r\nmade any mistakes, it means good-by for the Cobulus, for me,\r\nand--for you!\r\n\r\n\"I leave it to your good sense to tell me if there's anything I've\r\noverlooked.\" And he laid his hands on the starting-levers.\r\n\r\nReblong said nothing so far, such was his chagrin and wonder. But\r\nnow he evidently considered seriously what Fort had said.\r\n\r\n\"I see you mean it, Mr. Fort. And--you ought to know that once\r\nyou've cleared the landing-dock, you'll have a hard time to keep her\r\nlevel unless you're up on the bridge. That is, while you're shifting\r\nthe wing-angle. But you ought to be down here to do that; and,\r\nmeanwhile, she might nose down and slam into something, and--\"\r\nReblong shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"I see.\" The athlete pondered for a moment. Then he lifted the\r\nengineer bodily, chair and all, and moved him over nearer the\r\ninstrument. Next he loosened one of Reblong's hands, just enough to\r\npermit him to reach certain of the levers. He also did some more\r\ntying of knots and shifting of buckles, roped the chair to a\r\nstanchion, and made sure that Reblong could not undo himself.\r\n\r\n\"It's up to you,\" said Fort with the new light in his eyes. \"You run\r\nthis thing as it ought to be run, and you're safe. Trick me in any\r\nway, and I'll get you!\"\r\n\r\nReblong took a single look at those eyes. \"I understand,\" said he,\r\nin a low voice; and without further ado the athlete went to the\r\nelevator.\r\n\r\nIn less than a minute the order came to \"cast off.\" The engineer did\r\nnot hesitate, but threw the levers and turned the wheels which Fort\r\nhad expected to operate himself. Another second and the great craft\r\nwas rising from its seat.\r\n\r\nShouts, muffled and faint because of the ship's double windows,\r\nsounded from outside. Reblong saw the sheds sinking rapidly below\r\nhim. In thirty seconds the vessel was free of the dock.\r\n\r\n\"First gear ahead,\" came the signal; and again Reblong obeyed.\r\nPractically he had no choice. Another man, of nobler training, might\r\nhave preferred to be loyal at all costs. But Reblong, the\r\nrepresentative Capellan workman, saw the lights of the sheds shift\r\nslowly to the rear, then go out of sight as the speed increased. He\r\nsaw one or two fliers preparing to pursue, but he knew that the\r\ncruiser would easily outstrip the best of them.\r\n\r\nThe Cobulus had got clear away!\r\n\r\nIt was an hour later that the four, this time through the doctor and\r\nyoung Ernol, learned the sequel to Fort's daring feat. The boy was\r\nalone in his cell, awake in the darkness, when one of the guards\r\nmarched up to his door and unlocked it.\r\n\r\n\"Come out,\" he ordered; and Ernol preceded him down the corridor, up\r\na flight of stairs, through another corridor and thence into the\r\nexercise grounds. On the other side of this was a small building,\r\nwith no opening save one door, now bright with light. Inside, Ernol\r\nfound the other men who had been arrested with him, closely watched\r\nby a dozen of the prison guards. His father was not there;\r\napparently they were waiting for him to be brought.\r\n\r\n\"It worked all right,\" whispered the man at Ernol's right, as the\r\nboy was lined up. Ernol only nodded slightly, keeping his eyes fixed\r\nupon the door. A moment later, the elder Ernol arrived, accompanied\r\nby a man whom the doctor instantly recognized.\r\n\r\nIt was Eklan Norbith, the man whose infernally ingenious use of the\r\nclock's pendulum had wrung the truth about the secret photographs\r\nfrom the boy's father. He looked even more cruel and repellant now,\r\nthan he had that night on the couch. Apparently quite recovered, he\r\nmade a truly forbidding figure.\r\n\r\nHe had evidently been sent for by the warden; for, with a slow,\r\nmalignant stare at the row of prisoners, he stated the case in his\r\nheavy, ominous tones:\r\n\r\n\"You are all supposed to know the rules. One of you has been\r\nsmuggling drugs into the prison; we have found specimens in each\r\ncell. It only remains to learn which of you is the guilty party; and\r\nthat, I propose to uncover within one minute!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and glared around again. The stillness was unbroken for a\r\nmoment; then one prisoner coughed nervously. This started half the\r\nrest to doing the same; and under cover of the noise, Ernol\r\nwhispered to the man on his right:\r\n\r\n\"No sight of him yet! I'm afraid you showed the drug too soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I waited until I heard the clock strike,\" protested the other; and\r\nthen both stood on their guard as the commission's deputy went on\r\nwith his arraignment:\r\n\r\n\"It is my duty to inform you, although you probably already know it,\r\nthat this building is made of iron. Floor, walls, and ceiling are\r\nthe same.\" The doctor saw that the prisoners' feet were all bare.\r\n\"And the whole place is heavily wired with high-power electricity!\r\n\r\n\"The guards and I will now leave you to yourselves.\" His teeth\r\nshowed in an evil smile. \"We will give you a few kilowatts as a\r\nstarter, and shut it off after ten seconds. If you are not ready by\r\nthat time to tell me which of you is guilty, I will then let you\r\nhave the current twice as strong!\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoners looked at each other anxiously. Ernol threw back his\r\nhead defiantly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't weaken!\" he exclaimed. \"The juice can't hurt you!\"\r\n\r\nImmediately the guards backed out, keeping their weapons trained on\r\nthe crowd. Norbith was the last to go. He left the door open; and\r\nfrom where the boy stood he could plainly watch the man as he worked\r\nthe switches, just outside.\r\n\r\nInstantly the place was in an uproar. Of course, the doctor felt\r\nnothing of the prickling, nerve-shaking pain that gripped every one\r\nof those barefoot men. They leaped and darted here and there, bluish\r\nsparks flashing wherever they touched the iron; or they fell after a\r\nstep or two and writhed on the floor, shrieking and cursing with the\r\nexquisite torture of that awful current. Ernol alone kept from\r\nshouting; he stood and took it, trembling like a leaf.\r\n\r\nBut it lasted only a moment or two. The uproar ceased. Norbith\r\nstepped back into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" The slow smile again. \"Want to tell now?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer the boy clapped his hand to his mouth and blew a shrill\r\nwhistle. Norbith stared in astonishment. Then, all of a sudden, a\r\ntremendous thing happened.\r\n\r\nA veritable hurricane swooped down upon the place. There was a vast\r\nrush of wind, accompanied by a thunderous noise, like breakers. Then\r\ntwo huge masses of metal clanged against the sides of the building;\r\nthere was a grinding crash, and the whole structure rocked and\r\nswayed as though in the grasp of some supernatural monster. Next\r\nsecond the lights went out; the wires had snapped.\r\n\r\n\"All aboard; look out, below!\" sang out a voice. It was Fort,\r\ncalling from far overhead.\r\n\r\nAnd then, slowly at first but with quickening speed, the iron\r\nbuilding rose into the air; arose, and floated away like a toy\r\nballoon. It was fast in the grip of the Cobulus's grappling-irons!\r\n\r\nNorbith was the only officer left in the room. He regained his\r\nsenses with lightning speed. Out came his electric torch; he trained\r\nit on the prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"By God!\" he cursed. \"You'll not get away, you--\" And he fumbled\r\nwith the weapon in his belt.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the boxlike machine guns. Young Ernol hesitated only\r\nan instant. Then he dashed forward.\r\n\r\nThe box spat fire. The boy threw his weight against the deputy, so\r\nthat the man lost his balance and toppled out the door into the arms\r\nof the guards below.\r\n\r\nAnd the doctor brought his own mind back to his body not one second\r\nbefore the lad, burnt through and through by the flame of the man's\r\nweapon, fell back into the room--dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nPOWART STRIKES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom then on until the end the doctor was out of it. Try as he\r\nmight, he could find no other mind with which to connect, no other\r\nview-point like his own. He had to content himself with what the\r\nothers learned.\r\n\r\nTheir knowledge of the rescue stopped short soon after the Cobulus,\r\nwith its living freight, quitted the prison grounds. Reblong, as\r\nSmith watched, continued to operate the engines during about two\r\nhundred miles of flight; then Fort, having shown one of his new\r\ncomrades how to steer, came down to the instruments, leading the\r\nforce of cleaners whom he had kidnaped.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks very much,\" to Reblong, in the voice of a man who was having\r\nthe time of his life. \"I dare say you feel a little sour about this;\r\nbut later on you can have the satisfaction of having helped, even\r\nthough against your will.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do now?\" Reblong wanted to know as the\r\nathlete released him from his chair. The other Capellans were\r\ncontent to stare and listen.\r\n\r\nThe strange glint came back into Fort's eyes. \"It's up to you,\r\nfolks!\" And he explained the situation, making it clear that they,\r\nthe cruiser's workmen, would not dare return and tell the truth, for\r\nfear of punishment for disloyalty. In the end the Cobulus was\r\nhalted, and Reblong and the rest were set down in an unsettled\r\nmountain country, with enough supplies to last a year.\r\n\r\nThus the engineer became a fugitive. Smith learned nothing further\r\nfrom him. For all practical purposes, the investigation was narrowed\r\ndown to what Billie, through Mona, and her husband, through Powart,\r\nwere able to uncover. But it was enough; enough to strain their\r\nimaginations to the snapping point, and make all four doubt their\r\nnew-found senses.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon declared that he intended to warn Powart that his plan was\r\nsuspected. \"It's only fair,\" stoutly, \"after what you told Fort,\r\nthrough Mona.\" And Billie had no answer to that.\r\n\r\nSo the geologist watched the chief closely, finding it decidedly\r\nhard to catch him in the required state of semiconsciousness.\r\nApparently Powart was always alert, even up to the exact moment of\r\ngoing to sleep; after which he invariably slept like a log, but\r\nawakening with a start, bolt upright in bed. But Van Emmon continued\r\nto watch his chance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another message had been received from the Alma\r\nexpedition. It ran as follows, after decoding:\r\n\r\nPeople here are planning to construct a great fleet to visit Hafen\r\nand Holl about the middle of next year. To carry a regular army of\r\nmissionaries, to preach the gospel of social democracy.\r\n\r\nBetter make the most of your reign while it lasts, Mr. Powart.\r\nMarried yet?\r\n\r\nThe chairman was glad to get this, rather than otherwise. Somehow\r\nthe thing strengthened his whole plan. From his standpoint the\r\nproposed invasion of missionaries \"to preach the gospel of social\r\ndemocracy,\" was far more to be feared than a military invasion.\r\n\r\nSo, although he made certain changes in the message, he did not have\r\nto counterfeit his earnestness when he presented the matter to his\r\nstaff, the former commission. Perhaps the expedition's last remark,\r\n\"Married yet?\" had something to do with the vigor of his tones.\r\n\r\n\"They are planning,\" he told the nine, \"to undo all that our\r\ncivilization has accomplished. Unless we can circumvent them, Hafen\r\nand Holl will be turned into bedlam.\"\r\n\r\nHe lost no time about what he had next to say. \"Knowing what we do\r\nabout Alma's designs upon us, I believe that it would be folly to\r\nwait until we are attacked. They doubtless possess inventions\r\nagainst which we would be powerless; they are such highly advanced\r\npeople in such matters. So what I propose is to prevent them from\r\nattacking us at all!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused portentously, finding in each face before him an anxious\r\nexcitement which was exactly what he wanted. They were hanging\r\nbreathlessly upon his words.\r\n\r\n\"Let me remind you that Alma is not only our nearest neighbor in the\r\nsolar system, but that, at present, only a few million miles\r\nseparate us. She is within a few weeks of the nearest point.\r\nFurthermore\"--speaking with care--\"we must remember that Alma is not\r\nonly nearer the sun than we are, but it is a much older planet. Were\r\nit not for the glass with which she is completely roofed in, the\r\npeople would suffer from lack of air. In short, this roof of theirs\r\nis vitality itself to them. Now, my campaign--subject to your\r\nsuggestions and advices--shall be to puncture that roof!\"\r\n\r\nThe sensation was tremendous. None of the nine had ever heard the\r\nlike before. And yet, such was the dominating energy of their\r\ncommander, it bridged the gap for them all; instantly they saw that\r\nhis idea was the best possible.\r\n\r\n\"The only question, of course--sir--is the matter of means.\" The\r\nshock-headed man spoke with immense respect. The others looked as\r\nthough they envied him his nerve.\r\n\r\nPowart was ready with his reply. \"I have already considered this.\r\nBriefly we shall construct a piece of artillery of such dimensions\r\nthat we can bombard the planet directly!\"\r\n\r\nHe explained that it meant operations on a scale never before\r\nattempted. It meant a cannon as much beyond what had ever been made\r\nbefore, as that roof had exceeded anything of the kind. \"And so far\r\nas I have figured the matter, the total resources of Holl will have\r\nto be pressed into service for the purpose. There will be no\r\nopportunity for insurrection while this work is in progress.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went on to elaborate. The nine made some suggestions, a few\r\nof which were adopted. The thing was worked out, then and there,\r\nwith such completeness that the plan was publicly announced the very\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nPowart himself carried a copy of the manifesto to Mona. He found her\r\nsuperintending the work of her gardeners. She did suggest going into\r\nthe house, but offered him a seat on the grass beside her. He stood\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to be the only thing to do,\" commented the surgeon, after\r\nreading the document in silence. She had not the remotest idea, of\r\ncourse, that the whole thing was based upon pure fraud. \"Are you\r\nsure that this bombardment will not cost a good many lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if there will be any loss at all,\" he replied. \"It is my\r\nintention to communicate with Alma just before the first shot is\r\nfired, and warn them what to expect; so that they can keep away from\r\nthe spot we shall aim at, and get supplies ready for repairing the\r\nbreak.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. Your plan is to keep them so busy mending breaks that they\r\nwill lose all interest in their proposed invasion.\" She laughed a\r\nlittle. \"Really, it is a rather comical sort of warfare. But you\r\ncertainly deserve a great deal of credit for finding such a humane\r\nway out of the difficulty. You will go down in history as the\r\nworld's greatest man!\"\r\n\r\nPowart drew a deep breath. But he said quietly enough, \"Don't you\r\nthink that I have done enough to--dispose of that objection of\r\nyours?\"\r\n\r\nShe was momentarily at a loss for words. \"Really--the thing is so\r\nimmense--I can hardly believe that you did all this entirely on my\r\naccount. Did you?\"\r\n\r\nHe was taken off his guard. \"Yes--I mean, no. Your objection was\r\nwhat set me to thinking; but the opportunity of doing our people a\r\nservice--that, Mona, is what--\" He hesitated; it was not easy, with\r\nthe girl staring innocently at him, declare that he had not\r\ndeliberately formed his opportunity out of thin air.\r\n\r\nBut she had no suspicions. Billie had not been able to reach her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe four on the earth knew little of Fort. He called up Powart two\r\ndays after the Cobulus's sensational flight, reporting that he had\r\nbeen kidnapped \"by some masked men\" along with Reblong and the\r\nothers, but that he alone had escaped. The ship, was found,\r\nabandoned, in an undeveloped part of Holl; and all signs indicated\r\nthat the former prisoners had separated at this point. Prolonged\r\nsearch failed to locate them, or the missing employees.\r\n\r\nFort continued to go and come quite as before. He called frequently\r\nupon Mona, with whom he was exceedingly careful to avoid all\r\nreference to Powart, for fear he might blurt out the truth. The girl\r\ntold him that he still had a lot of time to make good; she would not\r\nmarry, she said, until after all danger from Alma was past. He was\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\"I have a little scheme up my sleeve,\" casually, \"such as may amount\r\nto something, and may not. I need just about that much time to\r\nfinish it, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it anything you can talk about now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the subject was dropped.\r\n\r\nThus matters stood when half the industrial army of Holl, taken from\r\ntheir regular tasks, were set to the making of the giant gun and its\r\nequally giant projectiles. Monstrous though they were to be,\r\nhowever, they were no less prodigious than Powart. Could Fort,\r\nwondered Mona, possibly equal him?\r\n\r\nAnd so the weeks passed into months, and finally the great day came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE BLAST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see so many moving-picture men,\" said Mona\r\nthoughtfully. \"If it were not for photographs, I doubt if coming\r\ngenerations would believe this.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she turned her glasses again upon the scene. From the cockpit of\r\nFort's newest ornithopter, about three hundred yards from the ground\r\nand less than that distance from the spot, she could watch\r\noperations with exceptional ease. Fort agreed with her comment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; to merely state that the mouth of that cannon is a hundred\r\nfeet in diameter, and that it is set a mile and a half into the\r\nground, at an angle of thirty degrees--it's too much of a strain on\r\nthe imagination. However, I understand they've taken flash-light\r\npictures from the interior, such as will make it easier to believe.\"\r\n\r\nA huge compound crane was slowly swinging the first projectile into\r\nplace over the muzzle of that colossal gun. Mona eyed the immense\r\nshell with curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"As I understand it,\" she said, \"the projectile is really a number\r\nof shells, telescoping, one within another. I've forgotten how many\r\nthere are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty. The idea, of course, is that the original charge of powder\r\nwithin the cannon will send the projectile at something like two\r\nmiles a second. Upon reaching a certain point in space another\r\ncharge will be automatically fired in the base of the outermost\r\nshell. Thus it will act as another cannon, from which the remaining\r\nshells will be shot. And so on, until the forty-ninth shell has been\r\nblown to the rear. The remaining one will, by that time, have\r\ntraveled far enough to get out of our gravitation into Alma's.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the size of the fiftieth shell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only two feet in diameter; [Footnote: All dimensions are\r\nnecessarily a matter of judgment; but they represent the opinion of\r\nan architect, whose sense of proportion is presumably better than\r\naverage.] but of such length that it will hold five tons of\r\nexplosive. It is expected to demolish a square mile of their roof.\"\r\n\r\nThe great projectile was carefully lowered until its tip was flush\r\nwith the volcano-like mouth of the cannon. The proceeding took a\r\nlong time; and it was well toward the end of the work that Powart's\r\nhandsome yacht swept into the space provided for it in the circle of\r\nspectators. By prearrangement this space was next to that occupied\r\nby Mona and Fort.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the yacht had come to a stop its thrumming wings keeping\r\nit as steadily suspended in mid air as any of the lighter craft\r\nroundabout, Powart himself stepped out upon the tiny bridge. It was\r\nthe signal for a great outburst of applause, in which Fort joined as\r\nheartily as any one.\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem at all envious of Mr. Powart,\" commented Mona,\r\nwatching the athlete curiously.\r\n\r\nHe looked around as though surprised, and protested:\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I am really proud of his success. You see, it's\r\nthis way, Mona: If he fails, then I fail too!\"\r\n\r\nAnd before she could ask what he meant he raised his voice enough\r\nfor the dictator to hear:\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations, Powart! Everything coming along all right?\"\r\n\r\nPowart gave Fort one of his piercing looks, but showed no sign of\r\nirritation as he replied: \"All reports satisfactory. We shall have\r\nour little fireworks promptly on the second.\" Then to Mona: \"Sorry I\r\ncannot invite you aboard my ship; but I shall be so occupied with\r\nthe ceremonial end of this, you know, that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" instantly. \"I would really be in the way; and I\r\nshouldn't care to be that, to-day of all days.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Van Emmon, through Powart's eyes, judged that the dictator stood\r\nmountain-high in her respect at that instant.\r\n\r\nFort listened with the utmost indifference, seeming to take a boy's\r\nrapt interest in the spectacle below him rather than in the affair\r\nat his elbow. He glanced at his watch and remarked: \"Less than half\r\nan hour now. I can hardly wait!\"\r\n\r\nMona eyed him speculatively. \"What did you mean, just now, about\r\nyour success depending upon Mr. Powart's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just that,\" he returned lightly. \"Why, if he fails, my little\r\nscheme is a miserable fiasco! I shan't be able to marry you at all;\r\nthat is, unless you grant an extension!\"\r\n\r\nMona did not respond to his levity.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you'd be serious!\" she rebuked him. \"Just think what this\r\naffair means!\"\r\n\r\nHe pretended to be thoughtful. \"Oh, to Alma, you mean! Yes, indeed;\r\nthe folks will be badly upset, I imagine, if the projectile actually\r\nreaches their roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, do you think it may not?\" surprised.\r\n\r\n\"It's barely possible. The whole thing has been very scientifically\r\ncalculated, of course; but the slightest flaw in the mathematics\r\ncould cause a miss. Yes, the projectile may never reach its mark;\r\nit's something to be considered.\"\r\n\r\n\"In which case,\" returned Mona, evidently convinced that he was\r\nteasing, \"in which case, your own scheme falls through!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" with the utmost calm. \"My scheme depends upon the cannon,\r\nnot upon the projectile.\"\r\n\r\nMona nearly lost her temper. \"I wish you wouldn't talk in riddles!\"\r\nBut Fort was plainly unwilling to say anything further just then; he\r\nchanged the subject, directing Mona's glasses toward a point far to\r\nthe rear, where the blue wall of the contact loomed, some twenty\r\nmiles away. The spot had been chosen, of course, because there were\r\nfewer inhabitants in that locality than any other; the discharge of\r\nthe gun would mean an immense volume of smoke and gas, likely to\r\nprove disagreeable for days. Nobody cared to live near the contact,\r\nbecause of its queer, sunless conditions.\r\n\r\n\"Almost time we were getting out of here,\" said Fort, after another\r\nlook at his watch. As he spoke a warning whistle on Powart's yacht\r\nsounded shrilly; and with one accord the surrounding horde of\r\nsightseers--all belonging to the leisure class, of course--began to\r\nback away from the spot. The workmen, down below, were already\r\ntaking flight. A moment later Powart, speaking for the benefit of a\r\nrecording phonograph, began as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Precisely at the hour, minute and second determined by the\r\ncommission's mathematicians the projectile will be slid into the\r\ncannon. The concussion will explode the powder in the breech. This\r\nfinal act is to take place\"--he glanced at his watch--\"within two\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\"By so doing, the people of Hafen and Holl, through me, their\r\ncommander-in-chief, do hereby deliberately take the offensive\r\nagainst Alma.\" He hesitated, then went on with fresh determination:\r\n\"Rather than permit them to prepare for the threatened invasion,\r\nthen, we thus proceed to bombard their roof, in order to so harass\r\nthem that they shall be made helpless against us.\"\r\n\r\nMona turned her gaze from the dictator, and took up her glasses. The\r\ngreat cannon was nearly a mile away from them now; not a single\r\naircraft was closer than Fort's and Powart's, which were still\r\nbacking away. The blast was not a thing to be sneered at. Mona's\r\nhands shook with excitement.\r\n\r\nPowart's eyes were on his watch. \"The thing is beyond all human\r\npower to prevent now. The projectile will be released by clockwork.\r\nIn fact\"--his voice rose, his excitement finally getting the better\r\nof him--\"it is even now sliding! It is only a matter of seconds; the\r\nprojectile is lubricated so as to slide easily.\"\r\n\r\nA breathless pause; another look at the watch, then:\r\n\r\n\"By this time, my friends, the projectile has reached--\"\r\n\r\nAnd even as the words quit his mouth, the cannon belched forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE DEVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMona removed from her ears two tiny devices like collar-buttons. She\r\nnoted Fort and the others doing the same. Without this protection\r\ntheir eardrums would have been burst. And while the girl was doing\r\nthis she heard the athlete hailing the dictator:\r\n\r\n\"Good for you, Powart! It's a fine job, and I'm ever so much obliged\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\nThe dictator stared in amazement. Mona looked from the one to the\r\nother, perplexed. Fort was laughing shakily.\r\n\r\n\"You may as well make your apologies now, Powart; you're out of it!\r\nI've won, and you've lost! I've done a bigger thing than you have!\"\r\n\r\nMona gave an exclamation of impatience. \"What do you mean?\" she\r\ncried shrilly. \"Are you out of your head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it! I mean just what I say! Powart hasn't succeeded;\r\nhe's failed. And because he has failed, I've outdone him.\"\r\n\r\nHe was gazing impudently at the dictator as he said this; Powart was\r\nleaning over the railing of the bridge, a short distance away, too\r\nindignant to speak. Next instant, however, Fort glanced at his\r\nwatch.\r\n\r\n\"Have to be leaving you now,\" he called. He turned his machine\r\naround. \"You'll learn soon enough, Powart, exactly what I mean. And\r\nyou'll know that I'm right. Good-by!\"\r\n\r\nWithin a minute he and Mona were two miles away. Fort kept silent\r\nall the while. He seemed to be intent upon getting the most out of\r\nhis machine, and kept looking anxiously at his watch. Finally Mona\r\ncould hold in no longer.\r\n\r\n\"Boy, I've simply got to know what your game is. You've kept me\r\nwaiting long enough.\"\r\n\r\nHe immediately began to explain. First, he told her frankly and\r\nfully, just what she had said to him over the telephone, when she\r\nwas under Billie's \"influence.\" \"I was so sure it was genuine I went\r\nright ahead on that lead, Mona.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are positive you heard me say that?\" from the girl\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. And somehow I knew it was the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Powart had tricked us; not merely the workers, whom he has been\r\nhoodwinking all along, but you and me and all the rest! So I looked\r\ninto the matter and discovered that the poor devils on Holl have\r\nbeen treated all wrong. All wrong, Mona! I never realized it before,\r\nuntil I investigated; but they've been enduring rank injustice for\r\ngenerations, and we've encouraged them to be satisfied with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" she interrupted softly. \"I've known it for years, boy.\r\nWhat could we do to help them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" cried Fort, looking ahead and down, toward the chasm of\r\nthe contact, then at his watch once more. \"Exactly what I found out,\r\nMona! There was no use telling them the truth; they wouldn't believe\r\nit! They were too well satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"And so, when I heard of Powart's scheme to bombard Alma, I saw a\r\nway to free the poor idiots on Holl! A way to release them from\r\ntheir bondage--OUR bonds, Mona--and defeat Powart's trickery, and\r\nwin you--all at one move!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was plainly thrilled. Yet she kept her voice comparatively\r\ncool as she asked:\r\n\r\n\"So far, so good. But I don't see that you've done anything at all\r\nexcept to kidnap me.\"\r\n\r\nHe made an impatient gesture. \"Look at the ground!\" he ordered\r\ncurtly; and Mona wonderingly obeyed.\r\n\r\nThey were nearly to the contact. This time, however, they were not\r\nflying down into the cleft, but over it. The curious, canonlike\r\nchasm where the two worlds touched was perhaps ten miles below them.\r\n\r\n\"Look closely!\" shouted Fort excitedly. He was glancing at his watch\r\nagain, and changing the angle of his wings. \"By heavens, we are just\r\nin time!\" The craft dove perilously; he straightened its course.\r\n\"Look closely, I tell you! It's something you've never seen before,\r\nand will never see again!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mona, staring down at the point where Hafen and Holl came\r\ntogether--the curious region of balanced gravitations, like nothing\r\nelse anywhere in the universe--saw, as she passed over, something\r\nthat made her senses whirl.\r\n\r\nHafen and Holl were no longer one!\r\n\r\nThe two globes were now a quarter of a mile apart, and the distance\r\nwas steadily growing. Even as Mona watched the gap increased until\r\nalmost a mile separated the two great worlds.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see?\" cried Fort, fairly squirming in his seat. \"Do you see\r\nwhat I've done, Mona?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've taken Ernol and his friends--the bunch I rescued from the\r\nprison--and put them to work. Put them to work digging a tunnel!\r\nWe've been flying above that tunnel just now. It runs--from the\r\ncontact to the cannon--the bottom of the cannon, Mona!\r\n\r\n\"When Powart's shot was fired, the recoil--the kick--broke the\r\ncontact! Understand? Do you see it?\"\r\n\r\nMona stared in dull wonder. When she found voice it was strangely\r\nflat and commonplace.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but--I don't see how the recoil could separate two worlds as\r\nlarge as Hafen and Holl!\"\r\n\r\nFort chuckled breathlessly. \"Your forget something. You're thinking\r\nonly of the gravitation; you're forgetting the centrifugal force.\"\r\n\r\nHafen and Holl, by their daily rotation--around the contact as a\r\ncenter--were always tending to separate. That recoil was just enough\r\nto turn the balance; they'll never touch again.\r\n\r\n\"And what's more,\" he rushed on, \"Powart's shot is sure to miss! The\r\nrecoil threw the cannon out of line. Hafen had already mooved before\r\nthe projectile left the gun. Powart--has failed!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the surgeon wheeled upon the athlete. \"Boy, we're headed in\r\nthe wrong way! We'll land in Holl, not in Hafen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who wants to live in Hafen now?\" he shouted, clinging desperately\r\nto his controls. The craft was tossing in the newly created\r\nair-currents. \"Don't you see?\r\n\r\n\"I've cut Hafen from Holl forever! The workers aren't to be slaves\r\nany longer; they're to have their world to themselves, to use\r\nentirely for their own benefit; not for the owners!\r\n\r\n\"And the owners--back there--they're going to have their own world,\r\ntoo, just as they've always insisted! But from now on it's to be\r\ntheir farm, too, and their factory; they've got to get along without\r\nHoll from now on.\r\n\r\n\"Mona--the commission wouldn't allow evolution, and the workers\r\nwouldn't listen to revolution! So I've given them--devolution!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"I've given them devolution. I've given the race of man--a fresh\r\nstart.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mona was scarcely listening.\r\n\r\n\"Turn back!\" she screamed. \"I want to go back to my home! I don't\r\nwant to live in Holl. Turn back, I tell you!\"\r\n\r\nFort's face went white. He looked up at her appealingly. \"You don't\r\nmean that, Mona! Say you don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do! I want to go back!\" She glanced down at the ever-widening\r\ngap. \"Hurry! Turn back, or I'll do it myself!\"\r\n\r\nFort gazed straight into her eyes for an instant; then, his face\r\nwhiter than ever, he brought the craft to an abrupt halt in mid air.\r\nHe looked at his watch for the last time, and said, in a strangely\r\nhollow voice:\r\n\r\n\"Just as you wish, Mona. There's plenty of time to get back before\r\nthe air gets too thin in the gap.\r\n\r\n\"The point is, though, that if you go, you go alone!\" They looked at\r\none another unwaveringly. \"So far as I'm concerned, I shall spend\r\nthe rest of my life on Holl! No Hafen for mine! From now on I live\r\nwith the workers. Come--what do you say, Mona?\"\r\n\r\nShe answered instantly and stubbornly: \"I go back. What about you?\"\r\n\r\nHe took a parachute from a locker. \"Holl is below.\" He buckled the\r\nthing across his chest and stepped up on the edge of the cockpit.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean it, dear?\" said he softly.\r\n\r\nShe stared at him stonily. He turned away, his mouth shaking\r\nslightly, then held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, then, for the last time!\"\r\n\r\nMona suddenly grasped his hand. For an instant hope flared in Fort's\r\neyes, then faded, leaving his face gray and drawn. He poised hiself,\r\nletting go her hand reluctantly. Then he turned resolutely.\r\n\r\n\"It's the only thing for a man to do, Mona! As for you--turn about\r\nand go as fast as you canl You've got just time enough. Good-by!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with Mona unable to utter a single word, able only to watch and\r\nto feel, the athlete leaned to one side so as to clear the wing,\r\npulled his cap down tightly, and jumped into space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SILVER HEART\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMona leaped to the controls. She turned the craft about\r\nautomatically and started toward Hafen. Then she glanced over the\r\nside. What she saw brought her heart to her throat.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile below, and under Fort as he sank through the air, was\r\nanother flying machine which neither had noticed before. In it was\r\nthe figure of a man standing; he was maneuvering his craft so as to\r\nintercept the falling aviator. And the clear air of the high\r\naltitudes carried the sound of his voice faintly but surely to\r\nMona's ears.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you'd get away, did you, Fort?\" in heavy, insolent tones.\r\n\"Well, you get--left, my boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Eklan Norbith!\" cried Fort at the same instant. Next second he had\r\nlanded on the deputy's machine.\r\n\r\n\"Norbith!\" thought Mona, immediately recalling her patient at the\r\nhospital. She hesitated only an instant, then dove in a steep spiral\r\ndown toward the two.\r\n\r\nFort had fouled his parachute on a stanchion, in landing.\r\nBreathless, he lay in a tangle heap, looking up at the towering bulk\r\nof the deputy.\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to get clear this time, Fort, like you did that\r\nnight with the Cobulus and Ernol's gang!\" Norbith was saying\r\nsavagely, gloating over the man at his feet. \"Thought the lad killed\r\nme, I suppose. I was barely stunned. And I've been on your\r\ntail--ever since.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes glowed with anger. Mona watched him in silence as she\r\ncircled nearer. Norbith! The commission's deputy in Calastia; he\r\nrepresented all that was evil and cruel in the government. It was he\r\nwho did the nasty work, the things which Powart himself was too much\r\nof a gentleman to do. Norbith--the strong, cruel right arm on an\r\nunjust law!\r\n\r\n\"Well\"--Fort had regained his breath somewhat--\"now that you've got\r\nme, Norbith, what do you intend to do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do!\" The man's voice fairly boomed. \"I'm going to tear that\r\nparachute off your back and pitch you overboard, you infernal\r\noutlaw! And I'm going to claim that you resisted arrest!\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant he noted Mona for the first time. He started as he\r\nrecognized her. \"The surgeon!\"\r\n\r\nThen his rage came on him again. \"You hold your tongue, young woman,\r\nor I shall have it--pulled out! Do you understand?\" he demanded,\r\nthrusting his face up toward hers.\r\n\r\nAnd then Fort was upon him. All he cared for now was to get his\r\nfingers in Norbith's throat. And next moment Mona was desperately\r\nsteering his machine clear of the other as it swayed and thrashed\r\nabout under the struggling of the two men.\r\n\r\nThe advantage was with the deputy. Powerful man that he was, he was\r\nmore than a match for even Fort's great strength, while the\r\nathlete's agility did him no good in the restricted space of the\r\ncockpit. The parachute hindered him, too. Down on the ground, on a\r\nclear spot, it would have been different. As it was, Fort was\r\nquickly thrust to his knees, and, despite all that he could do, he\r\ncould not fight off the deputy's grip. In a moment it had shifted to\r\nthe athlete's throat.\r\n\r\n\"You would, would you!\" roared the deputy. \"By--you'll be dead even\r\nbefore you reach the ground!\"\r\n\r\nFort struggled wildly. In a moment he was strangling; Mona could see\r\nhis protruding eyes and lolling tongue. She could not help. She was\r\nnot athlete enough to leap to his aid. But all of a sudden, just as\r\nFort had once come to her own rescue, her tongue came to his.\r\n\r\n\"Boy! Boy! Tear open his shirt! Tear open his shirt!\"\r\n\r\nFort heard. For a second he hesitated, dull wonder in his starting\r\neyes; then he reached up, and with a spasmodic jerk of his hands,\r\nripped Norbith's shirt wide open. The man's bare chest was exposed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see?\" shrieked Mona hysterically. \"Look, boy! Look!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Fort saw. Saw the two silver tubes leading from the brown scar\r\nin the breast of this man--the man whose heart had been replaced by\r\na silver instrument. Saw the tubes, leading to a belt around the\r\nman's middle, where the pumping mechanism was concealed. And as Fort\r\nsaw, he understood.\r\n\r\nWith a final burst of strength he raised his quivering fingers and\r\nclutched one of the little pipes. A jerk, an exclamation from\r\nNorbith; and then, even as Fort's head fell back insensate, his hand\r\nsnapped the little tube in two.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" swore the deputy. \"You--you've--\" He gasped and\r\nspluttered; he let go of Fort. The athlete dropped like a log into\r\nthe bottom of the craft.\r\n\r\nBut Eklan Norbith stood upright, his hands thrashing wildly, his\r\nmouth twitching horribly. One end of the broken tube hissed with\r\nescaping air; the other end spouted blood. The deputy swayed; his\r\nhead dropped to his shoulders.\r\n\r\nAnd then the air rushed into his lungs for the last time; he gave a\r\nsingle piercing shriek, tottered, and fell backward out of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nFort opened his eyes to see Mona bending over him, bathing his head.\r\nHe looked around dully, blinked once or twice, frowned as though\r\ntrying to remember, and then said:\r\n\r\n\"How--did I get here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I waited until Norbith's machine steadied,\" said she in a\r\nwonderfully soft voice, \"and then flew down close enough to pick you\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nHe remembered. Suddenly he grasped at her arm and tried to get up.\r\n\"Hurry!\" he cried. \"You've only got time enough to make it! The\r\ngap--don't take any chances!\"\r\n\r\nBut the girl was paying no attention to where the machine was going.\r\nShe was looking at the man and seeming to be perfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care,\" she declared a little shakily. \"Holl looks good\r\nenough to me, dear--if you're going to be living on it!\"\r\n\r\nThe craft rocked perilously.\r\n\r\nBack on the earth, three of the four stirred in their chairs. The\r\ndoctor was the first to arouse. He sounded the gong to warn his\r\nwife, and the action helped to awaken the others; Billie first, then\r\nSmith. But Van Emmon did not rouse. Still connected with the\r\ndictator, Billie's husband was twisting and turning in his chair,\r\nmoaning slightly under his breath. In his subconscious mind some\r\nterrible scene was being enacted. Suddenly his mouth flew open, and\r\nthe words fairly tumbled forth:\r\n\r\n\"Ernol--at the contact--he's telephoned! Everybody knows now!\" Next:\r\n\"Billie: Why didn't you tell me? I could have warned Powart!\" And\r\nthen, in a voice of agony:\r\n\r\n\"God, what a mob! They'll kill him!\"\r\n\r\nBut he was still unconscious. The doctor exclaimed in fear.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" he ordered. \"Into the connection again!\" And he threw\r\nhimself back into his chair.\r\n\r\nIn a minute the three were still. Except for two great tears from\r\nBillie's eyes, there were no signs of life. Two minutes passed, then\r\nthree. Finally all four roused together.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" Van Emmon was the first to speak. His voice was harsh and\r\nstrained. \"By George, that was a narrow squeak! I thought sure I was\r\na goner! They threw Powart--out of his yacht!\"\r\n\r\nBillie caught his hand and patted it. Her lips were trembling; she\r\ncould not trust herself to speak. Her husband stared at her with\r\neyes that were still bewildered and tried hard to understand.\r\n\r\nSmith could say nothing. The doctor, however, got to his feet and\r\nstretched.\r\n\r\n\"Phew!\" taking off the brass bracelets and reaching for a handful of\r\nthe Venusian books. \"That was--going some!\"\r\n\r\nHe located a passage in one of the books. \"I guess we've had enough\r\nof people like ourselves. What do you say,\" eagerly, \"to visiting a\r\nplace where they're not even the same sort of animals as we are?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked around enthusiastically. Smith made a brief sound of\r\nagreement, and remained in his chair. Both he and the doctor looked\r\nto Billie and Van Emmon for comment.\r\n\r\nBut the man and the woman were content to look at one another. Their\r\nminds had room for only one problem; their eyes saw nothing, cared\r\nto see nothing, save that which love seeks and, having found, is\r\nsatisfied with.\r\n\r\nDid it make any difference to Billie that her husband had\r\nsympathized with Capellette's greatest despot and worst failure? Did\r\nit make any difference to Van that Billie approved when the woman\r\nshe was allied with discarded the despot for the devolutionist?\r\n\r\nOr was Billie still his chief reason for existing, and was Van hers?\r\n\r\nThat was the real question! Small matters like life in other\r\nworlds--they could wait!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATRIX\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE MENTAL EXPEDITION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor closed the door behind him, crossed to the table,\r\nsilently offered the geologist a cigar, and waited until smoke was\r\nissuing from it. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" bluntly, \"what's come between you and your wife, Van?\"\r\n\r\nThe geologist showed no surprise. Instead, he frowned severely at\r\nthe end of his cigar, and carefully seated himself on the corner of\r\nthe table. When he spoke there was a certain rigor in his voice,\r\nwhich told the doctor that his friend was holding himself tightly in\r\nrein.\r\n\r\n\"It really began when the four of us got together to investigate\r\nCapellette, two months ago.\" Van Emmon was a thorough man in\r\nimportant matters. \"Maybe I ought to say that both Billie and I were\r\nas much interested as either you or Smith; she often says that even\r\nthe tour of Mercury and Venus was less wonderful.\r\n\r\n\"What is more, we are both just as eager to continue the\r\ninvestigations. We still have all kinds of faith in the Venusian\r\nformula; we want to 'visit' as many more worlds as the science of\r\ntelepathy will permit. It isn't that either of us has lost\r\ninterest.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor rather liked the geologist's scientific way of stating\r\nthe case, even though it meant hearing things he already knew.\r\nKinney watched and waited and listened intently.\r\n\r\n\"You remember, of course, what sort of a man I got in touch with.\r\nPowart was easily the greatest Capellan of them all; a magnificent\r\nintellect, which I still think was intended to have ruled the rest.\r\nI haven't backed down from my original position.\"\r\n\r\n\"Van! You still believe,\" incredulously, \"in a government of the\r\nsort he contemplated?\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon nodded aggressively. \"All that we learned merely\r\nstrenthens my conviction. Remember what sort of people the working\r\nclasses of Capellette were? Smith's 'agent' was typical--a helpless\r\nnincompoop, not fit to govern himself!\" The geologist strove to keep\r\nhis patience.\r\n\r\n\"However,\" remarked Kinney, \"the chap whose mind I used was no\r\nfool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor was Billie's agent, the woman surgeon,\" agreed Van Emmon, \"even\r\nif she did prefer 'the Devolutionist' to Powart. But you'll have to\r\nadmit, doc, that the vast majority of the Capellans were\r\nincompetents; the rest were exceptions.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor spoke after a brief pause. \"And--that's what is wrong,\r\nVan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" grimly. \"Billie can't help but rejoice that things turned out\r\nthe way they did. She is sure that the workers, now that they've\r\nbeen separated from the ruling class, will proceed to make a perfect\r\nparadise out of their land.\" He could not repress a certain amount\r\nof sarcasm. \"As well expect a bunch of monkeys to build a steam\r\nengine!\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" after a little hesitation, \"as I said before, doc, I've no\r\nreason to change my mind. You may talk all you like about it--I\r\ncan't agree to such ideas. The only way to get results on that\r\nplanet is for the upper classes to continue to govern.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this is what you two have--quarreled about?\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon nodded sorrowfully. He lit another cigar absent-mindedly\r\nand cleared his throat twice before going on:\r\n\r\n\"My fault, I guess. I've been so darned positive about everything\r\nI've said, I've probably caused Billie to sympathize with her\r\nfriends more solidly than she would otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"But just because you've championed the autocrats so heartily--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid so!\" The geologist was plainly relieved to have stated\r\nthe case in full. He leaned forward in his eagerness to be\r\nunderstood. He told the doctor things that were altogether too\r\npersonal to be included in this account.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, out in the doctor's study, Smith had made no move\r\nwhatever to interrogate the geologist's young wife. Instead, the\r\nengineer simply remained standing after Billie had sat down, and\r\ngave her only an occasional hurried glance. Shortly the silence got\r\non her nerves; and--such was her nature, as contrasted with Van\r\nEmmon's--whereas he had stated causes first, she went straight to\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" explosively, \"Van and I have split!\"\r\n\r\nSmith was seldom surprised at anything. This time was no exception.\r\nHe merely murmured \"Sorry\" under his breath; and Billie rushed on,\r\nher pent-up feelings eager to escape.\r\n\r\n\"We haven't mentioned Capellette for weeks, Smith! We don't dare! If\r\nwe did, there'd be such a rumpus that we--we'd separate!\" Something\r\ncame up into her throat which had to be choked back before she could\r\ngo on. Then--\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why it is, but every time the subject is brought up\r\nVan makes me so WILD!\" She controlled herself with a tremendous\r\neffort. \"He blames me, of course, because of what I did to help the\r\nDevolutionist. But I can't be blamed for sympathizing with the under\r\ndog, can I? I've always preferred justice to policy, any time.\r\nJustice first, I say! And I think we've seen--there on Capellette--how\r\nutterly impossible it is for any such system as theirs to last\r\nindefinitely.\"\r\n\r\nBut before she could follow up her point the door opened and the\r\ndoctor returned with her husband. Kinney did not allow any tension\r\nto develop; instead, he said briskly:\r\n\r\n\"There's only a couple of hours remaining between now and dinner\r\ntime; I move we get busy.\" He glanced about the room, to see if all\r\nwas in place. The four chairs, each with its legs tipped with glass;\r\nthe four footstools, similarly insulated from the floor; the\r\nelectrical circuit running from the odd group of machinery in the\r\ncorner, and connecting four pair of brass bracelets--all were ready\r\nfor use. He motioned the others to the chairs in which they had\r\nalready accomplished marvels in the way of mental traveling.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he remarked, as he began to fit the bracelets to his wrists,\r\nan example which the rest straightway followed; \"now, we want to\r\nmake sure that we all have the same purpose in mind. Last time, we\r\nwere simply looking for four people, such as had view-points similar\r\nto our own. To-day, our object is to locate, somewhere among the\r\nplanets attached to one of the innumerable sun-stars of the\r\nuniverse, one on which the conditions are decidedly different from\r\nanything we have known before.\"\r\n\r\nBillie and Van Emmon, their affair temporarily forgotten, listened\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n\"As I recall it,\" Smith calmly observed, \"we agreed that this\r\nattempt would be to locate a new kind of--well, near-human. Isn't\r\nthat right?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded. \"Nothing more or less\"--speaking very\r\ndistinctly--\"than a creature as superior as we are, but NOT IN HUMAN\r\nFORM.\"\r\n\r\nSmith tried hard not to share the thrill. He had been reading\r\nbiology the previous week. \"I may as well protest, first as last,\r\nthat I don't see how human intelligence can ever be developed\r\noutside the human form. Not--possibly!\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon also was skeptical, but his wife declared the idea merely\r\nunusual, not impossible. \"Is there any particular reason against\r\nit?\" she demanded of the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I will say this much,\" cautiously. \"Given certain conditions, and\r\ninevitably the human form will most certainly become the supreme\r\ncreature, superior to all the others.\r\n\r\n\"However, suppose the planetary conditions are entirely different. I\r\nconceive it entirely possible for one of the other animals to forge\r\nahead of the man-ape; quite possible, Smith,\" as the engineer\r\nstarted to object, \"if only the conditions are different ENOUGH.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, we shall soon find out. I have been reading further in\r\nthe library the Venusians gave us, and I assure you that I've found\r\nsome astonishing things.\" He fingered one of the diminutive volumes.\r\n\"There is one planet in particular, whose name I have forgotten,\r\nwhere all animal life has disappeared entirely. There are none but\r\nvegetable forms on the land, and all of them are the rankest sort of\r\nweeds. They have literally choked off everything else!\r\n\r\n\"And the highest form of life there is a weed; a hideous\r\nmonstrosity, shaped something like an octopus, and capable of the\r\nmost horrible--\" He stopped abruptly, remembering that one of his\r\nhearers was a woman. \"Never mind about that now.\"\r\n\r\nHe indicated another of the little books. \"I think we will do well\r\nto investigate a planet which the Venusians call 'Sanus.' It belongs\r\nto the tremendous planetary family of the giant star Arcturus. I\r\nhaven't read any details at all; I didn't want to know more than\r\nyou. We can proceed with our discoveries on an equal footing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" objected Smith, recalling the previous methods, \"how are we\r\nto put our minds in touch with any of theirs, unless we know enough\r\nabout them to imagine their viewpoints?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our knowledge of their planet's name and location,\" replied the\r\ndoctor, \"makes it easier for us. All we have to do is to go into the\r\ntelepathic state, via the Venusian formula; then, at the same time,\r\neach must concentrate upon some definite mental quality, some\r\nparticular characteristic of his own mind, which he or she wishes to\r\nfind on Sanus. It makes no difference what it may be; all you have\r\nto do is, exert your imaginations a little.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, broken by Smith: \"We ought to tell each other\r\nwhat we have in mind, so that we don't conflict.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. For my part,\" said the doctor, \"I'd like to get in touch with\r\na being who is mildly rebellious; not a violent radical, but a\r\nphilosophical revolutionist. I don't care what sort of a creature\r\nhe, she, or it may be, so long as the mind is in revolt against\r\nwhatever injustice may exist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I,\" stated Smith, \"will stick to the idea of service.\" Nobody\r\nwas surprised that the engineer should make such a choice; he was,\r\nfirst, last, and all the time, essentially a useful man.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon was not ready with his choice. Instead: \"You say, doc,\r\nthat you know nothing further about Sanus than what you've already\r\ntold us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was about to mention that. The Venusians say that conditions are\r\nreversed from what we found on Capellette. Instead of Sanus being\r\nruled by a small body of autocrats, it is--ruled by the working\r\nclass!\"\r\n\r\n\"Under the circumstances,\" said Van, \"I'll take something different\r\nfrom what I got last time. No imperiousness this trip.\" He smiled\r\ngrimly. \"There was a time when I used to take orders. Suppose you\r\ncall my choice 'subordinacy.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How very noble of you!\" gibed Billie. \"My idea is supremacy, and\r\nplenty of it! I want to get in touch with the man higher up--the\r\nworker who is boss of the whole works!\" She flashed a single glance\r\nat her husband, then threw herself back in her chair. \"Go ahead!\"\r\n\r\nAnd before two minutes were up, the power of concerted thought,\r\naided by a common objective and the special electrical circuit which\r\njoined them, had projected the minds of the four across the infinite\r\ndepths of space. The vast distance which separated their bodies from\r\nSanus was annihilated, literally as quick as thought.\r\n\r\nNeither of the four stirred. To all appearances they were fast\r\nasleep. The room was quite still; only the clock ticked dully on the\r\nwall. Down-stairs, the doctor's wife kept watch over the house.\r\n\r\nThe greatest marvel in creation, the human mind, was exploring the\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nALMOST HUMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, the four still had the ability to communicate with each\r\nother while in the trance state; they had developed this power to a\r\nfair degree while investigating Capellette. However, each was so\r\ndeeply interested in what he or she was seeing during the first hour\r\nof their Sanusian experiences that neither thought to discuss the\r\nmatter until afterward.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor first made connection with the eyes of his agent, he\r\ninstinctively concluded that he, at least, had got in touch with a\r\nbeing more or less like himself. The whole thing was so natural; he\r\nwas surveying a sunny, brush-covered landscape from eyes whose\r\nheight from the ground, and other details, were decidedly those of a\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was comparative silence. Then his unknown agent\r\nswiftly raised something--a hand, presumably--to a mouth, and gave\r\nout a piercing cry. Whereupon the doctor learned something that\r\njarred him a trifle. His agent was--a woman!\r\n\r\nHe had time to congratulate himself upon the fact that he was (1) a\r\ndoctor, (2) a married man, (3) the father of a daughter or two,\r\nbefore his agent repeated her cry. Almost immediately it was\r\nanswered by another exactly like it, from an unseen point not far\r\naway. The Sanusian plainly chuckled to herself with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nA moment later there came, rather faintly, two more calls, each from\r\na different direction in the dun-colored brush. Still without moving\r\nfrom the spot, the doctor's agent replied two or three times,\r\nmeanwhile watching her surroundings very closely. Within half a\r\nminute the first of her friends came in sight.\r\n\r\nIt was a young woman. At a distance of about twenty yards she\r\nappeared to be about five feet tall and sturdily built. She was\r\ndressed in a single garment, made of the skin of some yellow,\r\nshort-haired animal. It may have been a lion cub. Around her waist\r\nwas a strip of hide, which served as a belt, and held a small,\r\nstone-headed tomahawk. One shoulder and both legs were left quite\r\nbare, revealing a complexion so deeply tanned that the doctor\r\ninstantly thought: \"Spanish!\"\r\n\r\nIn a way, the girl's face gave the same impression. Large,\r\ndark-brown eyes, full lips and a healthy glow beneath her tan, all\r\nmade it possible for her to pass as a Spaniard. However, there was\r\nnothing in the least coquettish about her; she had a remarkably\r\nindependent manner, and a gaze as frank and direct as it was pure\r\nand untroubled.\r\n\r\nIn one hand she carried a branch from some large-leafed shrub. The\r\neyes which Kinney was using became fixed upon this branch; and even\r\nas the newcomer cried out in joyous response to the other's\r\ngreeting, her expression changed and she turned and fled, laughing,\r\nas the doctor's agent darted toward her. She did not get away, and\r\nimmediately the two were struggling over the possession of the\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the tussle another figure made its appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Look out! Here comes Dulnop!\" [Footnote: It made no difference\r\nwhatever as to what language was used. The telepathic process\r\nemployed enabled the investigators to know all that their agents'\r\nsubconscious minds took in. The brains of the four automatically\r\ntranslated these thought-images into their own language. However,\r\nthis method did not enable them to learn what their agents were\r\nthinking, but only what they said, heard, and saw.] cried Kinney's\r\nagent; at the same time she made a special effort, and succeeded in\r\nbreaking off a good half of the branch.\r\n\r\nInstantly she darted to one side, where she calmly began to pluck\r\nsome small, hard-shelled nuts from the branch, and proceeded to\r\ncrack them, with entire ease, using a set of teeth which must have\r\nbeen absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nShe gave the latest comer only a glance or two. He--for it certainly\r\nwas a man--was nearly a half a foot taller than the girl already\r\ndescribed; but he was plainly not much older or younger, and in\r\nbuild and color much the same. He was clothed neither more nor less\r\nthan she, the only difference being that some leopardlike animal had\r\ncontributed the material. In his belt was tucked a primitive stone\r\nhammer, also a stone knife. His face was longer than hers, his eyes\r\ndarker; but he was manifestly still very boyish. Dulnop, they had\r\ncalled him.\r\n\r\n\"Hail, Cunora!\" he called to the girl who had brought the nuts;\r\nthen, to her who was watching: \"Rolla! Where got ye the nuts?\"\r\n\r\nRolla didn't answer; she couldn't use her mouth just then; it was\r\ntoo full of nuts. She merely nodded in the direction of Cunora.\r\n\r\n\"Give me some, Cunora!\"\r\n\r\nThe younger girl gave no reply, but backed away from him as he\r\napproached; her eyes sparkled mischievously and, the doctor thought,\r\nsomewhat affectionately. Dulnop made a sudden darting move toward\r\nher branch, and she as swiftly whirled in her tracks, so that he\r\nmissed. However, he instantly changed his mind and grasped the girl\r\ninstead. Like a flash he drew her to him and kissed her noisily.\r\n\r\nNext second he was staggering backward under the weight of her hard\r\nbrown fist. \"Do that again, and I'll have the hair out of thy head!\"\r\nthe girl screamed, her face flaming. Yet Kinney saw that the man was\r\nlaughing joyously even as he rubbed the spot where her blow had\r\nlanded, while the expression of her eyes quite belied what she had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nNot until then did the doctor's agent say anything. When she spoke\r\nit was in a deep, contralto voice which gave the impression of riper\r\nyears than either of the other two. Afterward Kinney learned that\r\nRolla was nearly ten years their senior, a somewhat more lithe\r\nspecimen of the same type, clad in the skin of what was once a\r\nmagnificent goat. She carried only a single small knife in her belt.\r\nAs seen reflected in pools of water, her complexion was slightly\r\npaler and her whole expression a little less self-assertive and\r\ndistinctively philosophical. To those who admire serious, thoughtful\r\nwomen of regular feature and different manner, Rolla would have\r\nseemed downright beautiful.\r\n\r\n\"Dulnop,\" said she, with a laugh in her voice, \"ye will do well to\r\nseek the nut tree, first as last.\" She nonchalantly crushed another\r\nshell in her mouth. \"Neither Cunora nor I can spare good food to a\r\nkiss-hungry lout like thee!\"\r\n\r\nHe only laughed again and made as though to come toward her. She\r\nstood ready to dodge, chuckling excitedly, and he evidently gave it\r\nup as a bad job. \"Tell me whence cameth the nuts, Cunora!\" he\r\nbegged; but the girl pretended to be cross, and shut her mouth as\r\nfirmly as its contents would allow.\r\n\r\nNext moment there was a shout from the thicket, together with a\r\ncrashing sound; and shortly the fourth Sanusian appeared. He was by\r\nfar the larger; but his size was a matter of width rather than of\r\nheight. An artist would have picked him as a model for Ajax himself.\r\nHis muscles fairly strained the huge lion's skin in which he was\r\nclad, and he had twice the weight of Dulnop within the same height.\r\nAlso, to the doctor's eye, he was nearer Rolla's age.\r\n\r\nHis face was strong and handsome in a somewhat fierce, relentless\r\nway; his complexion darker than the rest. He carried a huge club,\r\nsuch as must have weighed all of forty pounds, while his belt was\r\njammed full of stone weapons. The doctor classed him and the younger\r\ngirl together because of their vigor and independence, while Dulnop\r\nand Rolla seemed to have dispositions very similar in their\r\ncomparative gentleness and restraint.\r\n\r\n\"Hail, all of ye!\" shouted this latest arrival in a booming\r\nbaritone. He strode forward with scarcely a glance at the two\r\nyounger people; his gaze was fixed upon Rolla, his expression\r\nunmistakable. The woman quietly turned upon Dulnop and Cunora.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" she exclaimed, pointing to a spot back of them. \"See the\r\ncurious bird!\" They wheeled instantly, with the unquestioning faith\r\nof two children; and before they had brought their gazes back again,\r\nthe big man had seized Rolla, crushed her to his breast and kissed\r\nher passionately. She responded just as warmly, pushing him away\r\nonly in order to avoid being seen by the others. They showed only an\r\ninnocent disappointment at having missed seeing the \"curious bird.\"\r\n\r\n\"A simple-minded people, basically good-humored,\" was the way the\r\ndoctor summed the matter up when reporting what he had seen.\r\nHowever, it was not so easy to analyze certain things that were said\r\nduring the time the four Sanusians spent in each other's company.\r\nFor one thing--\r\n\r\n\"Did They give thee permission to go?\" Rolla was asked by the big\r\nman. His name, it seemed, was Corrus.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Corrus. They seemed to think it a good idea for us to take a\r\nlittle recreation to-day. I suppose ye left thy herd with thy\r\nbrother?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded; and the doctor was left to wonder whom \"They\" might be.\r\nWere They a small group of humans, whose function was to\r\nsuperintend? Or were They, as the books from Venus seemed to\r\nindicate, another type of creature, entirely different from the\r\nhumans, and yet, because of the peculiar Sanusian conditions,\r\nsuperior to the humans?\r\n\r\n\"They have decided to move their city a little farther away from the\r\nforest,\" Rolla overheard Dulnop telling Cunora; which was the first\r\nindication that the planet boasted such a thing as a city.\r\nOtherwise, things appeared to be in a primitive, rather than a\r\ncivilized condition.\r\n\r\nThese four skin-clad savages seemed to be enjoying an aboriginal\r\npicnic. For lunch, they munched on various fruits and nuts picked up\r\nen route, together with handfuls of some wheatlike cereal which the\r\nbig man had brought in a goatskin. From time to time they scared out\r\nvarious animals from the brush, chasing the creatures after the\r\nfashion of dogs and children. Whenever they came to a stream,\r\ninvariably all four splashed through it, shouting and laughing with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were but two of these streams, and both of them quite\r\nsmall. Their banks indicated that either the season was very far\r\nadvanced, or else that the streams were at one time vastly larger.\r\n\r\n\"A rather significant fact,\" the doctor afterward commented.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the most impressive thing about all that the doctor\r\nlearned that day was the strange mariner in which the excursion came\r\nto an end. The quartet was at that moment climbing a small hill,\r\napparently on the edge of an extensive range of mountains. An\r\noccasional tree, something like an oak, broke the monotony of the\r\nbrush at this point, and yet it was not until Rolla was quite at the\r\ntop of the knoll that Kinney could see surrounding country with any\r\ndegree of clearness. Even then he learned little.\r\n\r\nThe hill was placed on one edge of a valley about forty miles in\r\nwidth. A good part of it was covered with dusty vegetation,\r\npresumably wild; but the rest was plainly under cultivation. There\r\nwere large green areas, such as argued grain fields; elsewhere were\r\nwhat looked like orchards and vineyards, some of which were in full\r\nbloom--refuting the notion that the season was a late one. Nowhere\r\nwas there a spot of land which might be called barren.\r\n\r\nRolla and her three friends stood taking this in, keeping a rather\r\ncurious silence meanwhile. At length Cunora gave a deep sigh, which\r\nwas almost instantly reproduced by all the rest. Corrus followed his\r\nown sigh with a frank curse.\r\n\r\n\"By the great god Mownoth!\" he swore fiercely. \"It be a shame that\r\nwe cannot come hence a great deal oftener! Me-thinks They could\r\nallow it!\"\r\n\r\n\"They care not for our longings,\" spoke Cunora, her eyes flashing as\r\nangrily as his. \"They give us enough freedom to make us work the\r\nbetter--no more! All They care for is thy herd and my crops!\"\r\n\r\n\"And for the labor,\" reminded the big man, \"of such brains as\r\nRolla's and Dulnop's. It be not right that They should drive us so!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" agreed the younger man, with much less enthusiasm. \"However,\r\nwhat can ye do about it, Corrus?\"\r\n\r\nThe big man's face flushed, and he all but snarled. \"I tell ye what\r\nI can do I, and ye as well, if ye but will! I can--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, one hand upraised in mighty emphasis, and a sudden and\r\nstartling change came over him. Downright fear drove the anger from\r\nhis face; his massive body suddenly relaxed, and all his power and\r\nvigor seemed to crumble and wilt. His hands shook; his mouth\r\ntrembled. At the same time the two women shrank from him, each\r\ngiving an inarticulate cry of alarm and distress. Dulnop gave no\r\nsound, but the anger which had left the herdsman seemed to have come\r\nto him; the youngster's eyes flared and his breast heaved. His gaze\r\nwas fixed upon Corrus's neck, where the sweat of fear already\r\nglistened.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the big man dropped his head, as though in surrender. He\r\ngasped and found voice; this time a voice as shaky and docile as it\r\nhad been strong and dominant a moment before.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" he spoke abjectly. \"Very well. I--shall do as you\r\nwish.\" He seemed to be talking to thin air. \"We--will go home at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nAnd instantly all four turned about, and in perfect silence took the\r\nback trail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWORLD OF MAMMOTHS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately upon going into tele-consciousness Smith became aware of\r\na decided change in his surroundings. The interior of the study had\r\nbeen darkened with drawn shades; now he was using eyes that were\r\nexposed to the most intense sunlight. The first sight that he got,\r\nin fact, was directed toward the sky; and he noted with an\r\nengineer's keen interest that the color of the sky was blue,\r\nslightly tinged with orange. This, he knew, meant that the\r\natmosphere of Sanus contained at least one chemical element which is\r\nlacking on the earth.\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two the sky remained entirely clear. There were no\r\nclouds whatever; neither did any form of winged life make its\r\nappearance. So Smith took note of sounds.\r\n\r\nPresumably his agent--whoever or whatever it might be--was located\r\nin some sort of aircraft; for an extremely loud and steady buzzing,\r\nsuggesting a powerful engine, filled the engineer's borrowed ears.\r\nTry as he might, however, he could not identify the sound exactly.\r\nIt was more like an engine than anything else, except that the\r\nseparate sounds which comprised the buzz occurred infinitely close\r\ntogether. Smith concluded that the machine was some highly developed\r\nrotary affair, working at perhaps six or eight thousand revolutions\r\na minute--three or four times as fast as an ordinary engine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his agent continued to stare into the sky. Shortly\r\nsomething arrived in the field of vision; a blurred speck, far to\r\none side. It approached leisurely, with the unknown agent watching\r\nsteadfastly. It still remained blurred, however; for a long time the\r\nengineer knew as little about its actual form as he knew about his\r\nmysterious agent.\r\n\r\nThen, like a flash, the vision cleared. All the blurring disappeared\r\ninstantly, and the form of a buzzard was disclosed. It was almost\r\ndirectly overhead, about a quarter of a mile distant, and soaring in\r\na wide spiral. No sound whatever came from it. Smith's agent made no\r\nmove of any kind, but continued to watch.\r\n\r\nShortly the buzzard \"banked\" for a sharper turn; and the engineer\r\nsaw, by the perspective of its apparent speed, that the aircraft\r\nwhose use he was enjoying was likewise on the move. Apparently it\r\nwas flying in a straight line, keeping the sun--an object vastly too\r\nbrilliant to examine--on the right.\r\n\r\nThe buzzard went out of sight. Once more the clear sky was all that\r\ncould be seen; that, and the continual roar of the engine, were all\r\nthat Smith actually knew. He became impatient for his agent to look\r\nelsewhere; it might be that the craft contained other specimens of\r\nthe unknown creatures. But there was no change in the vigilant watch\r\nwhich was being kept upon the sky.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the engineer became exceedingly alert. He had noticed\r\nsomething new--something so highly different from anything he had\r\nexpected to learn that it was some minutes before he could believe\r\nit true.\r\n\r\nHis borrowed eyes had no eyelids! At least, if they did, they were\r\nnever used. Not once did they flicker in the slightest; not once did\r\nthey blink or wink, much less close themselves for a momentary rest\r\nfrom the sun's glare. They remained as stonily staring as the eyes\r\nof a marble statue.\r\n\r\nThen something startling happened. With the most sickening\r\nsuddenness the aircraft came to an abrupt halt. Smith's senses swam\r\nwith the jolt of it. All about him was a confused jumble of blurred\r\nfigures and forms; it was infinitely worse than his first ride in a\r\nhoist. In a moment, however, he was able to examine things fairly\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe aircraft had come to a stop in the middle of what looked like a\r\ncane brake. On all sides rose yellowish-green shafts, bearing leaves\r\ncharacteristic of the maize family. Smith knew little about cane,\r\nyet felt sure that these specimens were a trifle large. \"Possibly\r\ndue to difference in gravitation,\" he thought.\r\n\r\nHowever, he could not tell much about the spot on which the machine\r\nhad landed. For a moment it was motionless; the engine had been\r\nstopped, and all was silent except for the gentle rustling of the\r\ncane in the field. The unknown operator did not change his position\r\nin the slightest.\r\n\r\nThen the craft began to move over the surface, in a jerky, lurching\r\nfashion which indicated a very rough piece of ground. At the same\r\ntime a queer, leathery squeaking came to the engineer's borrowed\r\nears; he concluded that the machine was being sorely strained by the\r\nmotion. At the time he was puzzled to account for the motion itself.\r\nEither there was another occupant of the craft, who had climbed out\r\nand was now pushing the thing along the ground, or else some form of\r\nsilent mechanism was operating the wheels upon which, presumably,\r\nthe craft was mounted. Shortly the motion stopped altogether.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Smith noticed something he had so far ignored\r\nbecause he knew his own dinner hour was approaching. His agent was\r\nhungry, like himself. He noticed it because, just then, he received\r\na very definite impression of the opposite feeling; the agent was\r\neating lunch of some sort, and enjoying it. There was no doubt about\r\nthis. All that Smith could do was to wish, for the hundredth time,\r\nthat he could look around a little and see what was being eaten, and\r\nhow.\r\n\r\nThe meal occupied several minutes. Not once did the strange occupant\r\nof that machine relax his stony stare at the sky, and Smith tried to\r\nforget how hungry he was by estimating the extent of his vision. He\r\ndecided that the angle subtended about a hundred and sixty degrees,\r\nor almost half a circle; and he further concluded that if his agent\r\npossessed a nose, it was a pretty trifling affair, too small to be\r\nnoticed. It was obvious, too, that the fellow's mouth was located\r\nmuch lower in the face than normal. He ate without showing a single\r\nparticle of food, and did it very quietly.\r\n\r\nAt length hunger was satisfied. There was complete stillness and\r\nsilence for a moment, then another short lurching journey through\r\nthe cane; and next, with an abruptness that made the engineer's\r\nsenses swim again, the fellow once more took to the air. The speed\r\nwith which he \"got away\" was enough to make a motorcyclist, doing\r\nhis best, seem to stand still.\r\n\r\nIt took time for Smith to regain his balance. When he did, the same\r\nunbroken expanse of sky once more met his gaze; but it was not long\r\nuntil, out of the corners of those unblinking eyes, he could make\r\nout bleary forms which shortly resolved themselves into mountain\r\ntops. It was odd, the way things suddenly flashed into full view.\r\nOne second they would be blurred and unrecognizable; the next,\r\nsharply outlined and distinct as anything the engineer had ever\r\nseen. Yet, there seemed to be no change in the focus of those eyes.\r\nIt wasn't as though they were telescopic, either. Not until long\r\nafterward did Smith understand the meaning of this.\r\n\r\nThe mountains grew higher and nearer. Before long it seemed as\r\nthough the aircraft was entering some sort of a canon. Its sides\r\nwere only sparsely covered with vegetation, and all of it was quite\r\nbrown, as though the season were autumn. For the most part the\r\nsurface was of broken rock and boulders.\r\n\r\nWithin a space of three or four minutes the engineer counted not\r\nless than ten buzzards. The unknown operator of the machine,\r\nhowever, paid no attention to them, but continued his extraordinary\r\nwatch of the heavens. Smith began to wonder if the chap were not\r\nseated in an air-tight, sound-proof chamber, deep in the hull of\r\nsome great aerial cruiser, with his eyes glued fast to a periscope.\r\n\"Maybe a sky patrol,\" thought the man of the earth; \"a cop on the\r\nlookout for aerial smugglers, like as not.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then came another of those terrifying stops. This time, as soon\r\nas he could collect his senses, the engineer saw that the machine\r\nhad landed approximately in the middle of the canon, and presumably\r\namong the boulders in its bottom. For all about it were the tops of\r\ngigantic rocks, most of them worn smooth from water action. And, as\r\nsoon as the engine stopped, Smith plainly heard the roar of water\r\nright at hand. He could not see it, however. Why in the name of\r\nwonder didn't the fellow look down, for a change?\r\n\r\nThe craft began to move. This time its motion was smoother arguing\r\nan even surface. However, it had not gone far before, to the\r\nengineer's astonishment, it began to move straight down a slope so\r\nsteep that no mechanism with which Smith was familiar could possibly\r\nhave clung to it. As this happened, his adopted eyes told him that\r\nthe craft was located upon one of those enormous boulders, in the\r\ncenter of a stream of such absolute immensity that he fairly gasped.\r\nThe thing was--colossal!\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was true. The unseen machine deliberately moved along\r\nuntil it was actually clinging, not to the top, but to the side of\r\nthe rock. The water appeared to be about five yards beneath, to the\r\nright. To the left was the sky, while the center of that strange\r\nvision was now upon a similar boulder seemingly a quarter of a mile\r\ndistant, farther out in the stream. But the fellow at the periscope\r\ndidn't change position one whit!\r\n\r\nIt was so unreal. Smith deliberately ignored everything else and\r\nwatched again for indications of eyelids. He saw not one flicker,\r\nbut noticed a certain tiny come-and-go, the merest sort of\r\nvibration, which indicated the agent's heart-action. Apparently it\r\nbeat more than twice as fast as Smith's.\r\n\r\nBut it relieved him to know that his agent was at least a genuine\r\nliving being. For a moment he had fancied something utterly\r\nrepellent to him. Suppose this Sanusian were not any form of natural\r\ncreature at all, but some sort of supermachine, capable of\r\nfunctioning like an organism? The thought made the engineer shudder\r\nas no morgue could.\r\n\r\nPresently the queer craft approached the water closely enough, and\r\nat such an angle, that Smith looked eagerly for a reflection.\r\nHowever, the water was exceedingly rough, and only a confused\r\nbrownish blur could be made out. Once he caught a queer sound above\r\nthe noise of the water; a shrill hiss, with a harsh whine at the\r\nend. \"Just like some kind of suction apparatus,\" as he later\r\ndescribed it.\r\n\r\nAnd then, with that peculiar sound fresh in his ears, came the\r\ncrowning shock of the whole experience. Floating toward the boulder,\r\nbut some distance away, was what looked like a black seed. Next\r\nmoment the vision flashed clear, as usual, and the engineer saw that\r\nthe object was really a beetle; and in a second it was so near that\r\nSmith's own body, back on the earth, involuntarily shrank back into\r\nthe recesses of his chair.\r\n\r\nFor that beetle was an enormity in the most unlimited sense of the\r\nword. It was infinitely larger than any beetle the engineer had ever\r\nseen--infinitely! It was as large as a good-sized horse!\r\n\r\nBut before Smith could get over his amazement there was a rush and a\r\nswirl in the water behind the insect. Spray was dashed over the\r\nrock, a huge form showed itself indistinctly beneath the waves, and\r\nnext instant the borrowed eyes were showing the engineer, so clearly\r\nas to be undeniable, the most astounding sight he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nA fish of mountainous size leaped from the water, snapped the beetle\r\ninto its mouth, and disappeared from sight. In a flash it had come\r\nand gone, leaving the engineer fairly gasping and likewise wondering\r\nhow he could possibly expect anybody to believe him if he told the\r\nbald truth of what he had seen.\r\n\r\nFor he simply could not have invented anything half as incredible.\r\nThe fish simply could not be described with ordinary language. IT\r\nWAS AS LARGE AS THE LARGEST LOCOMOTIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE GOLD-MINER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for Van Emmon, his experience will have to be classed with\r\nSmith's. That is to say, he soon came to feel that his agent was not\r\nwhat is commonly called human. It was all too different. However, he\r\nfound himself enjoying a field of view which was a decided\r\nimprovement upon Smith's. Instead of a range which began and ended\r\njust above the horizon, his agent possessed the power of looking\r\nalmost straight ahead.\r\n\r\nThis told the geologist that his unsuspecting Sanusian was located\r\nin an aircraft much like the other. The same tremendous noise of the\r\nengine, the same inexplicable wing action, together with the same\r\ntotal lack of the usual indications of human occupancy, all argued\r\nthat the two men had hit upon the same type of agent. In Van Emmon's\r\ncase, however, he could occasionally glimpse two loose parts of the\r\nmachine, flapping and swaying oddly from time to time within the\r\nrange of the observer, and at the front. Nothing was done about it.\r\nVan Emmon came to the same conclusion as Smith; the operator was\r\nlooking into something like a periscope. Perhaps he himself did not\r\ndo the driving.\r\n\r\nFrom what the geologist could see of the country below, it was quite\r\ncertainly cultivated. In no other way could the even rows and\r\nuniform growth be explained; even though Van Emmon could not say\r\nwhether the vegetation were tree, shrub, or plant, it was certainly\r\nthe work of man-or some-thing mightily like man.\r\n\r\nShortly he experienced an abrupt downward dive, such as upset his\r\nsenses somewhat. When he recovered, he had time for only the\r\nswiftest glance at what, he thought rather vaguely, was a great\r\ngreen-clad mountain. Then his agent brought the craft to one of\r\nthose nerve-racking stops; once more came a swimming of the brain,\r\nand then the geologist saw something that challenged his\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe craft had landed on the rim of a deep pit, or what would have\r\nbeen called a pit if it had not been so extraordinary. Mainly the\r\nstrangeness was a matter of color; the slope was of a brilliant\r\norange, and seemingly covered with frost, for it sparkled so\r\nbrightly in the sun as to actually hurt the eyes. In fact, the\r\ngeologist's first thought was \"A glacier,\" although he could not\r\nconceive of ice or snow of that tint.\r\n\r\nRunning down the sides of the pit were a number of dark-brown\r\nstreaks, about a yard wide; Van Emmon could make them out, more or\r\nless clearly, on the other side of the pit as well. From the\r\nirregular way in which the walls were formed, he quickly decided\r\nthat the pit was a natural one. The streaks, he thought, might have\r\nbeen due to lava flow.\r\n\r\nHis agent proceeded to drive straight over the rim and down the\r\nslope into the pit. His engine was quite stopped; like Smith, the\r\ngeologist wondered just how the craft's wheels were operated. Next\r\nhe was holding his breath as the machine reached so steep a point\r\nin the slope that, most surely, no brakes could hold it.\r\nSimultaneously he heard the hiss and whine which seemed to indicate\r\nthe suction device.\r\n\r\n\"It was a whole lot like going down into a placer mine,\" the\r\ngeologist afterward said; and in view of what next met his eyes, he\r\nwas justified in his guess.\r\n\r\nDown crept the machine until it was \"standing on its nose.\" The sun\r\nwas shining almost straight down into the slope, and Van Emmon\r\nforgot his uneasiness about the craft in his interest in what he\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the pit was perhaps twenty feet in diameter, and\r\nroughly hemispherical. Standing up from its bottom were half a dozen\r\nslim formations, like idealized stalagmites; they were made of some\r\nsemitransparent rock, apparently, the tint being a reddish yellow.\r\nFinally, perched on the top of each of these was a stone; and\r\nsurrounding these six \"landmarks,\" 'as Van Emmon called them, was\r\nthe most prodigious display of wealth imaginable. For the whole\r\nqueer place was simply sprinkled with gold. Gold--gold everywhere;\r\nlarge nuggets of it, as big as one's fist! Not embedded in rock, not\r\nscattered through sand, but lying loose upon the surface of that\r\nunbelievable orange snow! It was overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious Sanusian lost no time. Operating some unseen\r\nmachinery, he caused three shovel-like devices to project from the\r\nfront of his machine; and these instantly proceeded, so swiftly that\r\nVan Emmon could not possibly watch their action, to pick up nuggets\r\nand stow them away out of sight in what must have been compartments\r\nin the hull. All this was done without any sound beyond the\r\noccasional thud of a nugget dropped in the scramble. Suddenly the\r\nSanusian wheeled his machine about and started hurriedly up the\r\nslope. Van Emmon judged that the chap had been frightened by\r\nsomething, for he took flight as soon as he reached the top of the\r\npit. And--he left half a million in gold behind him!\r\n\r\nThis new flight had not lasted two minutes before the geologist\r\nbegan to note other objects in the air. There were birds, so distant\r\nthat he could not identify them; one came near enough, however, for\r\nhim to conclude that it was a hawk. But he did not hold to this\r\nconclusion very long.\r\n\r\nThe thing that changed his mind was another aircraft. It approached\r\nfrom behind, making even more noise than the other, and proceeded to\r\ndraw abreast of it. From time to time Van Emmon's agent turned his\r\nmysterious periscope so as to take it all in, and the geologist was\r\nable to watch his fill. Whereupon he became converted to a new idea:\r\nThe birds that Smith and he had seen had not been birds at all, but\r\naircraft built in imitation of them. For this new arrival had been\r\nmade in almost perfect imitation of a bee! It was very close to an\r\nexact reproduction. For one exception, it did not have the hairy\r\nappearance so characteristic of bees; the body and \"legs\" were\r\nsmooth and shiny. (Later, Van Emmon saw machines which went so far\r\nas even to imitate the hairs.) Also, instead of trying to duplicate\r\nthe two compound eyes which are found, one on each side of a bee's\r\nhead, a perfectly round representation of a single eye was built,\r\nlike a conning tower, toward the front of the bow. Presumably, the\r\nobserver sat or stood within this \"head.\"\r\n\r\nBut otherwise it was wonderfully like a drone bee. Van Emmon was\r\nstrongly reminded of what he had once viewed under a powerful lens.\r\nThe fragile semitransparent wings, the misshapen legs, and even the\r\njointed body with its scale-like segments, all were carefully\r\nduplicated on a large scale. Imagine a bee thirty feet long!\r\n\r\nAt first the geologist was puzzled to find that it carried a pair of\r\nmany-jointed antennae. He could not see how any intelligent being\r\nwould make use of them; they were continually waving about, much as\r\nbees wave theirs. Evidently these were the loose objects he had\r\nalready noted. \"Now,\" he wondered, \"why in thunder did the builders\r\ngo to so much trouble for the sake of mere realism?\"\r\n\r\nThen he saw that the antennae served a very real purpose. There was\r\nno doubt about it; they were wireless antennae!\r\n\r\nFor presently the newcomer, who so far had not shown himself at any\r\npoint on his machine, sent out a message which was read as quickly\r\nas it was received by Van Emmon's agent, and as unconsciously\r\ntranslated:\r\n\r\n\"Number Eight Hundred Four, you are wanted on Plot Seventeen.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Van Emmon's unknown assistant replied at once:\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Superior.\"\r\n\r\nIt was done by means of an extremely faint humming device, reminding\r\nthe geologist of certain wireless apparata he had heard. Not a word\r\nwas actually spoken by either Sanusian.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon kept a close watch upon the conning tower on the other\r\nmachine. The sun was shining upon it in such a fashion that its\r\ngleam made inspection very difficult. Once he fancied that he could\r\nmake out a short, compact figure within the \"eye\"; but he could not\r\nbe sure. The glass, or whatever it was, reflected everything within\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nWas the airman a quadruped? Did he sit or stand upright, like a man?\r\nOr did he use all four limbs, animal-fashion? Van Emmon had to admit\r\nthat he could not tell; no wonder he didn't guess the truth.\r\n\r\nShortly after receiving the summons, the geologist's agent changed\r\nhis direction slightly; and within ten minutes the machine was\r\npassing over a large grain field. On the far edge was a row of\r\ntrees, and it was toward this that the Sanusian proceeded to\r\nvolplane, presently coming to another nausea-producing stop. Once\r\nmore Van Emmon was temporarily helpless.\r\n\r\nWhen he could look again, he saw that the machine had landed upon a\r\nsteep slope, this time with its nose pointing upward. Far above was\r\nwhat looked like a cave, with a growth of some queer, black grass on\r\nits upper rim. The craft commenced to move upward, over a smooth,\r\ndark tan surface.\r\n\r\nIn half a minute the machine had reached the top of the slope, and\r\nthe geologist looked eagerly for what might lie within the cave. He\r\nwas disappointed; it was not a cave at all. Instead, another brown\r\nslope, or rather a bulging precipice, occupied this depression.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon looked closer. At the bottom of this bulge was a queer\r\nfringe of the same kind of grass that showed on top of it. Van Emmon\r\nlooked from one to the other, and all of a sudden the thing dawned\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nThis stupendous affair was no mountainside; it was neither more nor\r\nless than the head of a colossal statue! A mammoth edition of the\r\nGoddess of Liberty; and the aircraft had presumed to alight upon its\r\ncheek!\r\n\r\nThe machine clung there, motionless, for some time, quite as though\r\nthe airman knew that Van Emmon would like to look a long while. He\r\ngazed from side to side as far as he could see, making out a small\r\nsection of the nose, also the huge curves of a dust-covered ear. It\r\nwas wonderfully life-like.\r\n\r\nNext second came the earthquake. The whole statue rocked and swayed;\r\nVan Emmon looked to see the machine thrown off. From the base of the\r\nmonument came a single terrific sound, a veritable roar, as though\r\nthe thing was being wrenched from the heart of the earth. From\r\nsomewhere on top came a spurt of water that splashed just beside the\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nThen came the most terrible thing. Without the slightest warning the\r\nstatue's great eye opened! Opened wide, revealing a prodigious pupil\r\nwhich simply blazed with wrath!\r\n\r\nThe statue was alive!\r\n\r\nNext second the Sanusian shot into the air. A moment and Van Emmon\r\nwas able to look again, and as it happened, the craft was now\r\ncircling the amazing thing it had just quit, so that the geologist\r\ncould truthfully say that he was dead sure of what he saw.\r\n\r\nHe was justified in wanting to be absolutely sure. Resting on the\r\nsolid earth was a human head, about fifty yards wide and\r\nproportionately as tall. It was alive; but IT WAS ONLY THE HEAD,\r\nNOTHING MORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE SUPER-RACE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Billie wanted to get in touch with a\r\ncreature having the characteristic which she had said she admired:\r\nsupremacy--\"A worker who is the boss!\" Bearing this in mind, her\r\nexperience will explain itself, dumfounding though it was.\r\n\r\nHer first sight of the Sanusian world was from the front of a large\r\nbuilding. The former architect was not able to inspect it minutely;\r\nbut she afterwards said that it impressed her as being entirely\r\nplain, and almost a perfect cube. Its walls were white and quite\r\nwithout ornament; there was only one entrance, an extremely low and\r\nbroad, flat archway, extending across one whole side. The structure\r\nwas about a hundred yards each way. In front was a terrace,\r\nseemingly paved with enormous slabs of stone; it covered a good many\r\nacres.\r\n\r\nPresumably Billie's agent had just brought her machine from the\r\nbuilding, for, within a few seconds, she took flight in the same\r\nabrupt fashion which had so badly upset Smith and Van Emmon. When\r\nBillie was able to look closely, she found herself gazing down upon\r\na Sanusian city.\r\n\r\nIt was a tremendous affair. As the flying-machine mounted higher,\r\nBillie continually revised her guesses; finally she concluded that\r\nLondon itself was not as large. Nevertheless her astonishment was\r\nmainly directed at the character, not the number of the buildings.\r\n\r\nThey were all alike! Every one was a duplicate of that she had first\r\nseen: cube-shaped, plain finished, flat of wall and roof. Even in\r\ncolor they were alike; in time the four came to call the place the\r\n\"White City.\" However, the buildings were arranged quite without any\r\nvisible system. And they were vastly puzzled, later on in their\r\nstudies, to find every other Sanusian city precisely the same as\r\nthis one.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was one thing which distinguished each building from\r\nthe rest. It was located on the roof; a large black hieroglyphic,\r\nset in a square black border, which Billie first thought to be all\r\nalike. Whether it meant a name or a number, there was no way to\r\ntell.[Footnote: Since writing the above, further investigations have\r\nproved that these Sanusian house-labels are all numbers.]\r\n\r\nBillie turned her attention to her agent. She seemed to belong to\r\nthe same type as Smith's and Van Emmon's; otherwise she was\r\ncertainly much more active, much more interested in her\r\nsurroundings, and possessed of a far more powerful machine. She was\r\ncontinually changing her direction; and Billie soon congratulated\r\nherself upon her luck. Beyond a doubt, this party was no mere slave\r\nto orders; it was she who gave the orders.\r\n\r\nBefore one minute had passed she was approached by a Sanusian in a\r\nbig, clumsy looking machine. Although built on the bee plan, it\r\npossessed an observation tower right on top of its \"head.\" (The four\r\nafterward established that this was the sort of a machine that\r\nSmith's agent had operated.) The occupant approached to within a\r\nrespectful distance from Billie's borrowed eyes, and proceeded to\r\nhum the following through his antennae:\r\n\r\n\"Supreme, I have been ordered to report for Number Four.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The case of insubordinancy which occurred in Section Eighty-five\r\nhas been disposed of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Number Four made an example of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Supreme.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the operator flew away, having not only kept his body\r\ntotally out of sight all the while, but having failed by the\r\nslightest token to indicate, by his manner of communicating that he\r\nhad the slightest particle of personal interest in his report. For\r\nthat matter, neither did Supreme.\r\n\r\nScarcely had this colloquy ended than another subordinate\r\napproached. This one used a large and very fine machine. She\r\nreported:\r\n\r\n\"If Supreme will come with me to the spot, it will be easier to\r\ndecide upon this case.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately the two set off without another word; and after perhaps\r\nfour minutes of the speediest travel Billie had known outside the\r\ndoctor's sky-car, they descended to within a somewhat short distance\r\nfrom the ground. Here they hovered, and Billie saw that they were\r\nstopped above some hills at the foot of a low mountain range.\r\n\r\nNext moment she made out the figures of four humans on top of a\r\nknoll just below. A little nearer, and the architect was looking,\r\nfrom the air, down upon the same scene which the doctor was then\r\nwitnessing through the eyes of Rolla, the older of the two Sanusian\r\nwomen. Billie could make out the powerful physique of Corrus, the\r\nslighter figure of Dulnop, the small but vigorous form of Cunora,\r\nand Rolla's slender, graceful, capable body. But at that moment the\r\nother flier began to say to Supreme:\r\n\r\n\"The big man is a tender of cattle, Supreme; and he owes his\r\npeculiar aptitude to the fact that his parents, for twenty\r\ngenerations back, were engaged in similar work. The same may be said\r\nfor the younger of the two women; she is small, but we owe much of\r\nthe excellence of our crops to her energy and skill.\r\n\r\n\"As for the other woman,\" indicating Rolla, \"she is a soil-tester,\r\nand very expert. Her studies and experiments have greatly improved\r\nour product. The same may be said in lesser degree of the youth, who\r\nis engaged in similar work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" coolly commented the Sanusian whose eyes and ears Billie\r\nenjoyed; \"then your line of action is clear enough. You will see to\r\nit that the big man marries the sturdy young girl, of course; their\r\noffspring should give us a generation of rare outdoor ability.\r\nSimilarly the young man and the older woman, despite their\r\ndifference in ages, shall marry for the sake of improving the breed\r\nof soil-testers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, Supreme. There is one slight difficulty, however, such as\r\ncaused me to summon you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Name the difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sanusian hesitated only a trifle with her reply: \"It is,\r\nSupreme, that the big man and the older woman have seen fit to fall\r\nin love with one another, while the same is true of the youth and\r\nthe girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"This should not have been allowed!\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit it, Supreme; my force has somehow overlooked their case,\r\nheretofore. What is your will?\"\r\n\r\nThe commandant answered instantly: \"Put an immediate end to their\r\ndesires!\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be done!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a stir on the ground. In fact, this was the\r\ninstant when Corrus began his vehement outcry against the tyranny of\r\n\"They.\" The two in the air came closer; whereupon Billie discovered\r\nthat Supreme did not understand the language of the humans below.\r\n[Footnote: The humans did not realize this fact, however; they\r\nassumed that \"They\" always understood.] Yet the herdsman's tones\r\nwere unmistakably angry.\r\n\r\n\"You will descend,\" commented Supreme evenly, \"and warn the big man\r\nnot to repeat such outbreaks.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately Supreme's lieutenant darted down, and was lost to view.\r\nThe commandant glanced interestedly here and there about the\r\nlandscape, returning her gaze to Corrus just as the man stopped in\r\nmid-speech. Billie was no less astonished than the doctor to see the\r\nherdsman's expression change as it did; one second it was that of\r\nrighteous indignation, the next, of the most abject subservience.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Billie could see no cause whatever for it; neither did\r\nshe hear anything. The other flier remained out of sight. All that\r\nthe architect could guess was that the operator had \"got the drop\"\r\non Corrus in some manner which was clear only to those involved.\r\nBadly puzzled, Billie watched the four humans hurry away, their\r\nmanner all but slinking.\r\n\r\nA moment later still another aircraft came up, and its operator\r\nreported. As before, Billie could make out not a single detail of\r\nthe occupant herself. She, too, wanted the commandant's personal\r\nattention; and shortly Billie was looking down upon a scene which\r\nshe had good reason to remember all the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of a large field, where some light green plant was\r\njust beginning to sprout, a group of about a dozen humans was at\r\nwork cultivating. Billie had time to note that they were doing the\r\nwork in the most primitive fashion, employing the rudest of tools,\r\nall quite in keeping with their bare heads and limbs and their\r\nskin-clad bodies. About half were women.\r\n\r\nSlightly at one side, however, stood a man who was not so busy. To\r\nput it plainly, he was loafing, with the handle of his improvised\r\nmattock supporting his weight. Clearly the two up in the air were\r\nconcerned only with him.\r\n\r\n\"He has been warned three times, Supreme,\" said the one who had\r\nreported the case.\r\n\r\n\"Three? Then make an example of him!\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be done, Supreme!\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant disappeared. Again the commandant glanced at this,\r\nthat, and the other thing before concentrating upon what happened\r\nbelow. Then Billie saw the man straighten up suddenly in his tracks,\r\nand with remarkable speed, considering his former laziness, he\r\nwhirled about, dodged, and clapped a hand upon his thigh.\r\n\r\nNext second he raised an exultant cry. Billie could not understand\r\nwhat he said; but she noted that the others in the group echoed the\r\nman's exultation, and started to crowd toward him, shouting and\r\ngesticulating in savage delight. Then something else happened so\r\nsudden and so dreadful that the woman who was watching from the\r\nearth was turned almost sick.\r\n\r\nLike a flash Supreme dropped, headlong, toward the group of humans.\r\nIn two seconds the distance was covered, and in the last fifth of a\r\nsecond Billie saw the key to the whole mystery.\r\n\r\nIn that last instant the man who before had seemed of ordinary size,\r\nwas magnified to the dimensions of a colossus. Instead of being\r\nunder six feet, he appeared to be near a hundred yards in height;\r\nbut Billie scarcely realized this till later, it all happened so\r\nquickly. There was an outcry from the group, and then the\r\ncommandant's aircraft crashed into the man's HAND; a hand so huge\r\nthat the very wrinkles in its skin were like so many gulleys; even\r\nin that final flash Billie saw all this.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the landing there was a loud pop, while Billie's\r\nsenses reeled with the stunning suddenness of the impact. Next\r\nsecond the machine had darted to a safe distance, and Billie could\r\nsee the man gnawing frantically at the back of his hand. Too late;\r\nhis hand went stiff, and his arm twitched spasmodically. The fellow\r\nmade a step or two forward, then swayed where he stood, his whole\r\nbody rigid and strained. An expression of the utmost terror was upon\r\nhis face; he could not utter a sound, although his companions\r\nshrieked in horror. Another second and the man fell flat, twitching\r\nconvulsively; and in a moment or two it was all over. He was dead!\r\n\r\nAnd then the truth burst upon the watcher. In fact, it seemed to\r\ncome to all four at the same time, probably by reason of their\r\nmental connections. Neither of them could claim that he or she had\r\npreviously guessed a tenth of its whole, ghastly nature.\r\n\r\nThe \"cane\" which Smith had seen had not been cane at all; it had\r\nbeen grass. The \"beetle\" in the stream had not been the giant thing\r\nhe had visualized it; neither had that fish been the size he had\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon's \"gold mine\" had not been a pit in any sense of the word;\r\nit had been the inside of the blossom of a very simple, poppy-like\r\nflower. The \"nuggets\" had been not mineral, but pollen. As for the\r\nincredible thing which Van Emmon had seen on the ground; that living\r\nstatue; that head without a body--the body had been buried out of\r\nsight beneath the soil; and the man had been an ordinary human,\r\nbeing punished in this manner for misconduct.\r\n\r\nInstead of being aircraft built in imitation of insects, the\r\nmachines had been constructed by nature herself, and there had been\r\nnothing unusual in their size. No; they were the real thing,\r\ndiffering only slightly from what might have been found anywhere\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\nIn short, it had all been simply a matter of view-point. The supreme\r\ncreature of Sanus was, not the human, but the bee. A poisonous bee,\r\nsuperior to every other form of Sanusian life! What was more--\r\n\r\n\"The damned things are not only supreme; THE HUMANS ARE THEIR\r\nSLAVES!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpossible, But--\r\n\r\nThe four looked at each other blankly. Not that either was at a loss\r\nfor words; each was ready to burst. But the thing was so utterly\r\nbeyond their wildest conceptions, so tremendously different in every\r\nway, it left them all a little unwilling to commit themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Smith finally, \"as I said in the first place, I can't\r\nsee how any other than the human form became supreme. As I\r\nunderstand biology--\"\r\n\r\n\"What gets me,\" interrupted Van Emmon; \"what gets me is, WHY the\r\nhumans have allowed such an infernal thing to happen!\"\r\n\r\nBillie smiled somewhat sardonically. \"I thought,\" she remarked,\r\ncuttingly, \"that you were always in sympathy with the upper dog, Mr.\r\nVan Emmon!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am!\" hotly. Then, with the memory of what he had just seen\r\nrushing back upon him: \"I mean, I was until I saw--saw that--\" He\r\nstopped, flushing deeply; and before he could collect himself Smith\r\nhad broken in again:\r\n\r\n\"I just happened to remember, doc; didn't you say that the\r\nVenusians, in those books of yours, say that Sanus is ruled by the\r\nworkers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what I was wondering about,\" from Van Emmon. \"The humans seem\r\nto do all the work, and the bees the bossing!\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor expected this. \"The Venusians had our viewpoint--the\r\nviewpoint of people on the earth, when they said that the workers\r\nrule. We consider the bee as a great worker, don't we? 'As busy as a\r\nbee,' you know. None of the so-called lower animals show greater\r\nindustry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say,\" demanded Smith, \"that these Sanusian bees\r\nowe their position to the fact that they are, or were, such great\r\nworkers?\"\r\n\r\nBefore the doctor could reply, Van Emmon broke in. It seemed as\r\nthough his mind refused to get past this particular point. \"Now, why\r\nthe dickens have the humans allowed the bees to dominate them? Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to go at this a little more systematically,\" remarked\r\nKinney, \"if we want to understand the situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, suppose we note a thing or two about conditions\r\nas we find them here on the earth. We, the humans, are accustomed to\r\nrank ourselves far above the rest. It is taken for granted.\r\n\r\n\"Now, note this: the human supremacy was not always taken for\r\ngranted.\" He paused to let it sink in. \"Not always. There was a time\r\nin prehistoric days when man ranked no higher than others. I feel\r\nsure of this,\" he insisted, seeing that Smith was opposed to the\r\nidea; \"and I think I know just what occurred to make man supreme.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" from Billie.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind now. I rather imagine we shall learn more on this score\r\nas we go on with our work.\r\n\r\n\"At any rate, we may be sure of this: whatever it was that caused\r\nman to become supreme on the earth, that condition is lacking on\r\nSanus!\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon did not agree to this. \"The condition may be there, doc,\r\nbut there is some other factor which overbalances it; a factor such\r\nas is--well, more favorable to the bees.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked around the circle. \"What do you think? 'A factor\r\nmore favorable to the bees.' Shall we let it go at that?\" There was\r\nno remark, even from Smith; and the doctor went an:\r\n\r\n\"Coming back to the bees, then, we note that they are remarkable for\r\nseveral points of great value. First, as we have seen, they are very\r\nindustrious by nature. Second, all bees possess wings and on that\r\ncount alone they are far superior to humans.\r\n\r\n\"Third--and to me, the most important--the bees possess a remarkable\r\ncombination of community life and specialization. Of course, when\r\nyou come to analyze these two points, you see that they really\r\nbelong to one another. The bees we know, for instance, are either\r\nqueens, whose only function is to fertilize the eggs; or workers,\r\nwho are unsexed females, and whose sole occupations are the\r\ncollecting of honey, the building of hives, and the care of the\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" speaking carefully, \"apparently these Sanusian bees have\r\ndeveloped something that is not unknown to certain forms of earth's\r\ninsect life. I mean, a soldier type. A kind of bee which specializes\r\non fighting!\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon was listening closely, yet he had got another idea:\r\n\"Perhaps this soldier type is simply the plain worker bee, all gone\r\nto sting! It may be that these bees have given up labor altogether!\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" muttered Smith, under his breath, \"all this doesn't solve\r\nthe real problem. Why aren't the HUMANS supreme?\" For once he became\r\nemphatic. \"That's what gets me! Why aren't the humans the rulers,\r\ndoc?\" Kinney waited until he felt sure the others were depending\r\nupon him. \"Smith, the humans on Sanus are not supreme now because\r\nthey were NEVER supreme.\"\r\n\r\nSmith looked blank. \"I don't get that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you? Look here: you'll admit that success begets success,\r\nwon't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Success begets success? Sure! 'Nothing succeeds like success.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, isn't that merely another way of saying that the\r\nconsciousness of superiority will lead to further conquests? We\r\nhumans are thoroughly conscious of our supremacy; if we weren't we'd\r\nnever attempt the things we do!\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon saw the point. \"In other words, the humans on the earth\r\nnever began to show their superiority until something--something\r\nbig, happened to demonstrate their ability!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\" cried Kinney. \"Our prehistoric ancestors would never have\r\nhanded down such a tremendous ambition to you and me if they, at\r\nthat time, had not been able to point to some definite feat and say,\r\n'That proves I'm a bigger man than a horse,' for example.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" reflected Billie, aloud; \"of course, there were other\r\nfactors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but they don't alter the case. Originally the human was only\r\nslightly different from the apes he associated with. There was\r\nperhaps only one slight point of superiority; today there are\r\nmillions of such points. Man is infinitely superior, now, and it's\r\nall because he was slightly superior, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we grant that,\" remarked the geologist. \"What then? Does\r\nthat explain why the bees have made good on Sanus?\"\r\n\r\n\"To a large degree. Some time in the past the Sanusian bee\r\ndiscovered that he possessed a certain power which enabled him to\r\nforce his will upon other creatures. This power was his poisonous\r\nsting. He found that, when he got his fellows together and formed a\r\nswarm, they could attack any animal in such large numbers as to make\r\nit helpless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any creature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; even reptiles, scales or no scales. They'd attack the eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that doesn't explain how the bees ever began to make humans\r\nwork for them,\" objected Van Emmon.\r\n\r\nThe doctor thought for a few minutes. \"Let's see. Suppose we assume\r\nthat a certain human once happened to be in the neighborhood of a\r\nhive, just when it was attacked by a drove of ants. Ants are great\r\nlovers of honey, you know. Suppose the man stepped among the ants\r\nand was bitten. Naturally he would trample them to death, and smash\r\nwith his hands all that he couldn't trample. Now, what's to prevent\r\nthe bees from seeing how easily the man had dealt with the ants? A\r\nman would be far more efficient, destroying ants, than a bee; just\r\nas a horse is more efficient, dragging a load, than a man. And yet\r\nwe know that the horse was domesticated, here on the earth, simply\r\nbecause the humans saw his possibilities; the horse could do a\r\ncertain thing more efficiently than a human.\r\n\r\n\"You notice,\" the doctor went on, with great care, \"that everything\r\nI've assumed is natural enough: the combination of an ant attack and\r\nthe man's approach, occurring at the same time. Suppose we add a\r\nthird factor: that the bees, even while fighting the ants, also\r\nstarted to attack the man; but that he chanced to turn his attention\r\nto the ants FIRST. So that the bees let him alone!\r\n\r\n\"We know what remarkable things bees are, when it comes to telling\r\none another what they know. Is there any reason why such an\r\nexperience--all natural enough--shouldn't demonstrate to them that\r\nthey, by merely threatening a man, could compel him to kill ants for\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\nBillie was dubious for a moment; then agreed that the man, also,\r\nmight notice that the bees failed to sting him as long as he\r\ncontinued to destroy their other enemies. If so, it was quite\r\nconceivable that, bit by bit, the bees had found other and more\r\npositive ways of securing the aid of men through threatening to\r\nsting. \"Even to cultivating flowers for their benefit,\" she\r\nconceded. \"It's quite possible.\"\r\n\r\nSmith had been thinking of something else. \"I always understood that\r\na bee's stinging apparatus is good for only one attack. Doesn't it\r\nalways remain behind after stinging?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" from the doctor, quietly. \"That is true. The sting has tiny\r\nbarbs on its tip, and these cause it to remain in the wound. The\r\nsting is actually torn away from the bee when it flies away. It\r\nnever grows another. That is why, in fact, the bee never stings\r\nexcept as a last resort, when it thinks it's a question of\r\nself-defense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what I thought!\" chuckled Smith. \"A bee is helpless without\r\nits sting! If so, how can you account for anything like a soldier\r\nbee?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor returned his gaze with perfect equanimity. He looked at\r\nVan Emmon and Billie; they, too, seemed to think that the engineer\r\nhad found a real flaw in Kinney's reasoning. The doctor dropped his\r\neyes, and searched his mind thoroughly for the best words. He\r\nremoved his bracelets while he was thinking; the others did the\r\nsame. All four got to their feet and stretched, silently but\r\nthoroughly. Not until they were ready to quit the study did the\r\ndoctor make reply.\r\n\r\n\"Smith, I don't need to remind you that it's the little things that\r\ncount. It's too old a saying. In this case it happens to be the\r\ngreatest truth we have found today.\r\n\r\n\"Smith\"--speaking with the utmost care--\"what we have just said\r\nabout the bee's sting is all true; but only with regard to the bees\r\non the earth. It is only on the earth, so far as we know positively,\r\nthat the bee is averse to stinging, for fear of losing his sting.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one way to account for the soldier bee. Its sting has\r\nno barbs!\"\r\n\r\n\"No barbs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? If the poison is virulent enough, the barbs wouldn't be\r\nnecessary, would they? Friends, the Sanusian bee is the supreme\r\ncreature on its planet; it is superior to all the other insects, all\r\nthe birds, all the animals; and its supremacy is due solely and\r\nentirely to the fact that there are no barbs on its sting!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE MISSING FACTOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time the four once more got together in the doctor's study,\r\neach had had a chance to consider the Sanusian situation pretty\r\nthoroughly. All but Billie were convinced that the humans were\r\ndeserving people, whose position was all the more regrettable\r\nbecause due, so far as could be seen, the insignificant little\r\ndetail of the barbless sting.\r\n\r\nWere these people doomed forever to live their lives for the sake of\r\ninsects? Were they always to remain, primitive and uncultured, in\r\nignorance of the things that civilization is built upon, obeying the\r\norders of creatures who were content to eat, reproduce, and die? For\r\nthat is all that bees know!\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was for the best. Possibly Rolla and her friends were\r\nbetter off as they were. It might have been that a wise Providence,\r\nseeing how woefully the human animal had missed its privileges on\r\nother worlds, had decided to make man secondary on Sanus. Was that\r\nthe reason for it all?\r\n\r\nAll but Billie scouted the idea. To them the affair was a ghastly\r\nperversion of what Nature intended. Van Emmon stated the case in a\r\nmanner which showed how strongly he felt about it.\r\n\r\n\"Those folks will never get anywhere if the bees can help it!\" he\r\ncharged.\" We've got to lend a hand, here, and see that they get a\r\nchance!\"\r\n\r\nSmith said that, so far as he was concerned, the bees might all be\r\nconsigned to hell. \"I'm not going to have anything to do with the\r\nagent I had, any more!\" he declared. \"I'm going to get in touch with\r\nthat chap, Dulnop. What is he like, doc?\"\r\n\r\nKinney told him, and then Van Emmon asked for details of the\r\nherdsman, Corrus. \"No more bees in my young life, either. From now\r\non it's up to us. What do you think?\" turning to his wife, and\r\ncarefully avoiding any use of her name.\r\n\r\nThe architect knew well enough that the rest were wondering how she\r\nwould decide. She answered with deliberation:\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to stay in touch with Supreme!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are!\" incredulously, from her husband.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! I've got a darned sight more sympathy for those bees than for\r\nthe humans! The 'fraid-cats!\" disgustedly.\r\n\r\n\"But listen,\" protested Van Emmon. \"We can't stand by and let those\r\ncold-blooded prisoners keep human beings, like ourselves, in rank\r\nslavery! Not much!\"\r\n\r\nEvidently he thought he needed to explain. \"A human is a human, no\r\nmatter where we find him! Why, how can those poor devils show what\r\nthey're good for if we don't give 'em a chance? That's the only way\r\nto develop people--give 'em a chance to show what's in 'em! Let the\r\nbest man win!\"\r\n\r\nBillie only closed her mouth tighter; and Smith decided to say,\r\n\"Billie, you don't need to stand by your guns just because the\r\nSanusian working class happens to be insects. Besides, we're three\r\nto one in favor of the humans!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well,\" she condescended, \"if you put it that way I'll agree not\r\nto interfere. Only, don't expect me to help you any with your\r\nschemes; I'll just keep an eye on Supreme, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we're agreed.\" The doctor put on his bracelets. \"Suppose we go\r\ninto the trance state for about three minutes--long enough to learn\r\nwhat's going on today.\"\r\n\r\nShortly Billie again using the eyes and ears of the extraordinarily\r\ncapable bee who ruled the rest, once more looked down upon Sanus.\r\nShe saw the big \"city,\" which she now knew to be a vast collection\r\nof hives, built by the humans at the command of the bees. At the\r\nmoment the air was thick with workers, returning with their loads of\r\nhoney from the fields which the humans had been compelled to\r\ncultivate. What a diabolical reversal of the accepted order of\r\nthings!\r\n\r\nThe architect had time to note something very typical of the case.\r\nOn the outskirts of the city two humans were at work, erecting a new\r\nhive. Having put it together, they proceeded to lift the big box and\r\nplace it near those already inhabited. They set it down in what\r\nlooked like a good location, but almost immediately took it up again\r\nand shifted it a foot to one side. This was not satisfactory,\r\neither; they moved it a few inches in another direction.\r\n\r\nAll told, it took a full minute to place that simple affair where it\r\nwas wanted; and all the while those two humans behaved as though\r\nsome one were shouting directions to them--silent directions, as it\r\nwere. Billie knew that a half-dozen soldier bees, surrounding their\r\ntwo heads, were coolly and unfeelingly driving them where they\r\nwilled. And when, the work done, they left the spot, two soldiers\r\nwent along behind them to see that they did not loiter.\r\n\r\nAs for the doctor, he came upon Rolla when the woman was deep in an\r\nexperiment. She stood in front of a rude trough, one of perhaps\r\ntwenty located within a large, high-walled inclosure. In the trough\r\nwas a quantity of earth, through the surface of which some tiny\r\ngreen shoots were beginning to show.\r\n\r\nRolla inspected the shoots, and then, with her stone knife, she made\r\na final notch in the wood on the edge of the trough. There were\r\ntwenty-odd of these notches; whereas, on other troughs which the\r\ndoctor had a chance to see, there were over thirty in many cases,\r\nand still no shoots.\r\n\r\nThe place, then, was an experimental station. This was proven by\r\nRolla's next move. She went outside the yard and studied five heaps\r\nof soil, each of a different appearance, also three smaller piles of\r\npulverized mineral--nitrates, for all that the doctor knew. And\r\nbefore Kinney severed his connection with the Sanusian, she had\r\nbegun the task of mixing up a fresh combination of these ingredients\r\nin a new trough. In the midst of this she heard a sound; and turning\r\nabout, waved a hand excitedly toward a distant figure on the far\r\nside of a nearby field.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Smith had managed to get in touch with Dulnop. He found\r\nthe young man engaged in work which did not, at first, become clear\r\nto the engineer. Then he saw that the chap was simply sorting over\r\nbig piles of broken rock, selecting certain fragments which he\r\nplaced in separate heaps. Not far away two assistants were pounding\r\nthese fragments to powder, using rude pestles, in great, nature-made\r\nmortars--\"pot-holes,\" from some river-bed.\r\n\r\nIt was this powder, beyond a doubt, that Rolla was using in her\r\nwork. To Smith, Dulnop's task seemed like a ridiculously simple\r\noccupation for a nearly grown man, until he reflected that these\r\naborigines were exactly like toddling children in intellects.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon had no trouble in making connections with Corrus. The\r\nherdsman was in charge of a dozen cows, wild looking creatures which\r\nwould have been far too much for the man had they been horned, which\r\nthey were not. He handled them by sheer force, using the great club\r\nhe always carried. Once while Van Emmon was watching, a cow tried to\r\nbreak away from the group; but Corrus, with an agility amazing in so\r\nshort and heavy a man, dashed after the creature and tapped her\r\nlightly on the top of her head. Dazed and contrite, she followed him\r\nmeekly back into the herd.\r\n\r\nThe place was on the edge of a meadow, at the beginning of what\r\nlooked like a grain field. Stopping here, Corrus threw a hand to his\r\nmouth and gave a ringing shout. Immediately it was answered,\r\nfaintly, by another at a distance; and then Van Emmon made out the\r\nform of Rolla among some huts on the other side of the grain. She\r\nbeckoned toward the herdsman, and he took a half-dozen steps toward\r\nher.\r\n\r\nJust as abruptly he stopped, almost in mid-stride. Simultaneously\r\nVan Emmon heard a loud buzzing in either ear. Corrus was being\r\nwarned. Like a flash he dropped his head and muttered: \"Vey well. I\r\nwill remember--next time.\" And trembling violently he turned back to\r\nhis cows.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked the geologist, when the four \"came out\" of their\r\nseance, \"the bees seem to have everything their own way. How can we\r\nhelp the humans best? Hurry up with your idea; I'm getting sick of\r\nthese damned poisoners.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor asked if the others had any suggestions. Smith offered\r\nthis: why couldn't the humans retire to some cave, or build\r\ntight-walled huts, and thus bar out the bees?\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he made the remark, however, than the engineer\r\ndeclared his own plan no good. \"These people aren't like us; they\r\ncouldn't stand such imprisonment long enough to make their 'strike'\r\nworth while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any reason,\" suggested Billie, indifferently, \"why they\r\ncouldn't weave face nets from some kind of grass, and protect\r\nthemselves in that way?\"\r\n\r\nSmith saw the objection to that, too. \"They'd have to protect\r\nthemselves all over as well; every inch would have to be covered\r\ntightly. From what I've seen of them I'd say that the arrangement\r\nwould drive them frantic. It would be worse than putting clothes on\r\na cat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a man-sized job we've tackled,\" commented the doctor. \"What\r\nSmith says is true; such people would never stand for any measures\r\nwhich would restrict their physical freedom. They are simply animals\r\nwith human possibilities, nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and then added quietly, \"By the way, did either of you\r\nnotice any mountains just now?\"\r\n\r\nSmith and Van Emmon both said they had. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, it isn't likely, but--did you see anything like a\r\nvolcano anywhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" both replied.\r\n\r\n\"Another thing,\" Kinney went on. \"So far, I've seen nothing that\r\nwould indicate lightning, much less the thing itself. Did either of\r\nyou,\" explicitly, \"run across such a thing as a blasted tree?\"\r\n\r\nThey said they had not. Billie hesitated a little with her reply,\r\nthen stated that she had noted a tree or two in a state of\r\ndisintegration, but none that showed the unmistakable scars due to\r\nbeing struck by lightning.\r\n\r\n\"Then we've got the key to the mystery!\" declared the doctor.\r\n\"Remember how brown and barren everything looks excepting only where\r\nthere's artificial vegetation? Well, putting two and two together, I\r\ncome to the conclusion that Sanus differs radically from the earth\r\nin this respect:\r\n\r\n\"The humans have arrived rather late in the planet's history.\r\nOr--and this is more likely--Sanus is somewhat smaller than the\r\nearth, and therefore has cooled off sooner. At any rate, the\r\nrelationship between the age of the planet and the age of its human\r\noccupancy differs from what it is on the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't quite see,\" from Smith, \"what that's got to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No? Well, go back to the first point: the dried-up appearance of\r\nthings. That means, their air and water are both less extensive than\r\nwith us, and for that reason there are far fewer clouds; therefore,\r\nit is quite possible that there has been no lightning within the\r\nmemory of the humans.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" demanded the geologist.\r\n\r\n\"Why, simply because lightning depends upon clouds. Lightning is\r\nmerely the etheric electricity, drawn to the earth whenever there is\r\nenough water in the air to promote conductivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" agreed Smith; \"but--what of it?\"\r\n\r\nKinney went on unheeding. \"As for volcanoes--probably the same\r\nexplanation accounts for the lack of these also. You know how the\r\nearth, even, is rapidly coming to the end of her Volcanic period.\r\nTime was when there were volcanoes almost everywhere on the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The same is likely true of Sanus as well. The point is,\" and the\r\ndoctor paused significantly, \"there have been no volcanic eruptions,\r\nand no lightning discharges within the memory of Sanusian man!\"\r\n\r\nWhat was he getting at? The others eyed him closely. Neither Van\r\nEmmon nor Smith could guess what he meant; but Billie, her intuition\r\nwide awake, gave a great jump in her chair.\r\n\r\n\"I know!\" she cried. A flood of light came to her face.\r\n\r\n\"The Sanusians--no wonder they let the bees put it over on them!\"\r\n\r\n\"They haven't got FIRE! They've never had it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nFIRE!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of his eyes Kinney saw Van Emmon turn a gaze of\r\nfrank admiration at his wife. It lasted only a second, however; the\r\ngeologist remembered, and masked the expression before Billie could\r\ndetect it.\r\n\r\nSmith had been electrified by the idea.\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" he exclaimed two or three times. \"Why didn't I think of\r\nthat? It's simple as A, B, C now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" Van Emmon exulted, \"all we've got to do is put the idea of\r\nfire into their heads, and the job is done!\" He jumped around in his\r\nchair. \"Darn those bees, anyhow!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" observed the doctor, \"it's not quite as simple as we may\r\nthink. Of course it's true that once they have fire, the humans\r\nought to assert themselves. We'll let that stand without argument.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will we?\" Smith didn't propose to back down that easy. \"Do you mean\r\nto say that fire, and nothing more than fire, can bring about human\r\nascendency?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor felt sure. \"All the other animals are afraid of fire.\r\nSuch exceptions as the moth are really not exceptions at all; the\r\nmoth is simply driven so mad by the sight of flame that it commits\r\nsuicide in it. Horses sometimes do the same.\r\n\r\n\"Humans are the only creatures that do not fear fire! Even a tiny\r\nbaby will show no fear at the sight of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which ought to prove,\" Van Emmon cut in to silence Smith, \"that\r\nsuperiority is due to fire, rather than fire due to superiority, for\r\nthe simple reason that a newborn child is very low in the scale of\r\nevolution.\" Smith decided not to say what he intended to say. Van\r\nEmmon concluded:\r\n\r\n\"We've just got to give 'em fire! What's the first step?\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose,\" from the doctor, \"that when we get in touch this time\r\nwe concentrate on the idea of fire. We've got to give them the\r\nnotion first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you rather,\" inquired Billie, \"that I kept the idea from\r\nSupreme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" returned her husband, icily, \"but you might just as well\r\ntell her, too. It'll make her afraid in advance, all the better!\"\r\n\r\nThe engineer threw himself back in his seat. \"I'm with you,\" said\r\nhe, laying aside his argument. The rest followed his example, and\r\npresently were looking upon Sanus again.\r\n\r\nAll told, this particular session covered a good many hours. The\r\nfour kept up a more or less connected mental conversation with each\r\nother as they went along, except, of course, when the events became\r\ntoo exciting. Mainly they were trying to catch their agents in the\r\nproper mood for receiving telepathic communications, and it proved\r\nno easy matter. It required a state of semi-consciousness, a\r\ncondition of being neither awake nor asleep. It was necessary to\r\nwait until night had fallen on that particular part of the planet.\r\n[Footnote: It should be mentioned that all parts of Sanus showed the\r\nsame condition of bee supremacy and human servitude. The spot in\r\nquestion was quite typical of all the colonies.]\r\n\r\nVan Emmon was the first to get results. Corrus had driven his herd\r\nback from the brook at which they had got their evening drink, and\r\nafter seeing them all quietly settled for the night, he lay down on\r\nthe dried grass slope of a small hill, and stared up at the sky. Van\r\nEmmon had plenty of time to study the stars as seen from Sanus, and\r\ncertainly the case demanded plenty of time.\r\n\r\nFor he saw a broad band of sky, as broad as the widest part of the\r\nMilky Way, which was neither black nor sparkling with stars, but\r\nglowing as brightly as the full moon! From the eastern horizon to\r\nthe zenith it stretched, a great \"Silvery Way,\" as Van Emmon labeled\r\nit; and as the darkness deepened and the night lengthened, the\r\nillumination crept on until the band of light stretched all the way\r\nacross. Van Emmon racked his brains to account for the thing.\r\n\r\nThen Corrus became drowsy. Van Emmon concentrated with all his\r\nmight. At first he overdid the thing; Corrus was not quite drowsy\r\nenough, and the attempt only made him wakeful. Shortly, however, he\r\nbecame exceedingly sleepy, and the geologist's chance came.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few minutes the herdsman sat up, blinking. He looked\r\naround at the dark forms of the cattle, then up at the stars; he was\r\nplainly both puzzled and excited. He remained awake for hours, in\r\nfact, thinking over the strange thing he had seen \"in a dream.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Smith was having a similar experience with Dulnop. The\r\nyoung fellow was, like Corrus, alone at the time; and he, too, was\r\nmade very excited and restless by what he saw.\r\n\r\nBillie was unable to work upon her bee. Supreme retired to a hive\r\njust before dusk, but remained wide awake and more or less active,\r\nfeeding voraciously, for hours upon hours. When she finally did nap,\r\nshe fell asleep on such short notice that the architect was taken\r\noff her guard. The bee seemed to all but jump into slumberland.\r\n\r\nThe doctor also had to wait for Rolla. The woman sat for a long time\r\nin the growing dusk, looming out pensively over the valley. Corrus\r\nwas somewhere within a mile or two, and so Kinney was not surprised\r\nto see the herdsman's image dancing, tantalizingly, before Rolla's\r\neyes. She was thinking of him with all her might.\r\n\r\nPresently she shivered with the growing coolness, and went into a\r\nrough hut, which she shared with Cunora. The girl was already asleep\r\non a heap of freshly gathered brush. Rolla, delightfully free of any\r\nneed to prepare for her night's rest--such as locking any doors or\r\ncleaning her teeth--made herself comfortable beside her friend. Two\r\nor three yawns, and the doctor's chance came.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes later Rolla sat bolt upright, at the same time giving\r\nout a sharp cry of amazement and alarm. Instantly Cunora awoke.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Rolla?\" terror-stricken.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" The older woman got up and went to the opening which served\r\nas a door. There she hung a couple of skins, arranging them\r\ncarefully so that no bee might enter. Coming back to Cunora, she\r\nbrought her voice nearly to a whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Cunora, I have had a wonderful dream! Ye must believe me when I say\r\nthat it were more than a mere dream; 'twere a message from the great\r\ngod, Mownoth, or I be mad!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rolla!\" The girl was more anxious than frightened now. \"Ye speak\r\nwildly! Quiet thyself, and tell what thou didst see!\r\n\r\n\"It were not easy to describe,\" said Rolla, getting herself under\r\ncontrol. \"I dreamed that a man, very pale of face and most curiously\r\nclad, did approach me while I was at work. He smiled and spake\r\nkindly, in a language I could not understand; but I know he meant\r\nfull well.\r\n\r\n\"This be the curious thing, Cunora: He picked up a handful of leaves\r\nfrom the ground and laid them on the trough at my side. Then, from\r\nsome place in his garments he produced a tiny stick of white wood,\r\nwith a tip made of some dark-red material. This he held before mine\r\neyes, in the dream; and then spake very reassuringly, as though\r\nbidding me not to be afraid.\r\n\r\n\"Well he might! Cunora, he took that tiny stick in his hand and\r\nmoved the tip along the surface of the trough; and, behold, a\r\nmiracle!\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened?\" breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"In the twinkling of an eye, the stick blossomed! Blossomed, Cunora,\r\nbefore mine eyes! And such a blossom no eye ever beheld before. Its\r\ncolor was the color of the poppy, but its shape--most amazing! Its\r\nshape continually changed, Cunora; it danced about, and rose and\r\nfell; it flowed, even as water floweth in a stream, but always\r\nupward!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rolla!\" incredulously. \"Ye would not awaken me to tell such\r\nnonsense!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it were not nonsense!\" insisted Rolla. \"This blossom was even\r\nas I say: a living thing, as live as a kitten! And as it bloomed,\r\nbehold, the stick was consumed! In a moment or two the man dropped\r\nwhat was left of it; I stooped--so it seemed--to pick it up; but he\r\nstopped me, and set his foot upon the beautiful thing!\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed, and then hurried on. \"Saying something further, also\r\nreassuring, this angel brought forth another of the strange sticks;\r\nand when he had made this one bloom, he touched it to the little\r\npile of leaves. Behold, a greater miracle, Cunora! The blossoms\r\nspread to the leaves, and caus'ed them to bloom, too!\"\r\n\r\nCunora was eying her companion pretty sharply. \"Ye must take me for\r\na simple one, to believe such imagining.\"\r\n\r\nRolla became even more earnest. \"Yet it were more than imagining,\r\nCunora; 'twere too vivid and impressive for only that. As for the\r\nleaves, the blossoming swiftly spread until it covered every bit of\r\nthe pile; and I tell thee that the bloom flowed as high as thy hand!\r\nMoreover, after a moment or so, the thing faded and died out, just\r\nas flowers do at the end of the season; all that was left of the\r\nleaves was some black fragments, from which arose a bluish dust,\r\nlike unto the cloud that ye and I saw in the sky one day.\r\n\r\n\"Then the stranger smiled again, and said something of which I\r\ncannot tell the meaning. Once more he performed the miracle, and\r\nthis time he contrived to spread the blossom from some leaves to the\r\ntip of a large piece of wood which he took from the ground. 'Twas a\r\nwonderful sight!\r\n\r\n\"Nay, hear me further,\" as Cunora threw herself, with a grunt of\r\nimpatience, back on her bed; \"there is a greater wonder to tell.\r\n\r\n\"Holding this big blooming stick in one hand, he gave me his other;\r\nand it seemed as though I floated through the air by his side.\r\nPresently we came to the place where Corrus's herd lay sleeping. The\r\nangel smote one of the cows with the flat of his hand, so that it\r\ngot upon its feet; and straighway the stranger thrust the flowing\r\nblossom into its face.\r\n\r\n\"The cow shrank back, Cunora! 'Twas deadly afraid of that beautiful\r\nflower!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is odd,\" admitted Cunora. She was getting interested.\r\n\r\n\"Then he took me by the hand again, and we floated once more through\r\nthe air. In a short time we arrived at the city of the masters.\r\n[Footnote: \"Having no microscopes, the Sanusians could not know that\r\nthe soldier bees were unsexed females; hence, \"masters.\"] Before I\r\nknew it, he had me standing before the door of one of their palaces.\r\nI hung back, afraid lest we be discovered and punished; but he\r\nsmiled again and spoke so reassuringly that I fled not, but watched\r\nuntil the end.\r\n\r\n\"With his finger he tapped lightly on the front of the palace. None\r\nof the masters heard him at first; so he tapped harder. Presently\r\none of them appeared, and flew at once before our faces. Had it not\r\nbeen for the stranger's firm grasp I should have fled.\r\n\r\n\"The master saw that the stranger was the offender, and buzzed\r\nangrily. Another moment, and the master would surely have returned\r\nto the palace to inform the others; and then the stranger would have\r\nbeen punished with the Head Out punishment. But instead the angel\r\nvery deliberately moved the blooming stick near unto the master; and\r\nbehold, it was helpless! Down it fell to the ground, dazed; I could\r\nhave picked it up, or killed it, without the slightest danger!\r\n\r\n\"Another master came out, and another, and another; and for each and\r\nall the flowing blossom was too much! None would come near it\r\nwittingly; and such as the angel approached with it were stricken\r\nalmost to death.\r\n\r\n\"When they were all made helpless the angel bade me hold my hand\r\nnear the bloom; and I was vastly surprised to feel a great warmth.\r\n'Twas like the heat of a stone which has stood all day in the sun,\r\nonly much greater. Once my finger touched the bloom, and it gave me\r\na sharp pain.\"\r\n\r\nCunora was studying her friend very closely. \"Ye could not have\r\ndevised this tale, Rolla. 'Tis too unlikely. Is there more of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little. The angel once more took me by the hand, and shortly set\r\nme down again in this hut. Then he said something which seemed to\r\nmean, 'With this magic bloom thou shalt be freed from the masters.\r\nThey fear it; but ye, and all like ye, do not. Be ye ready to find\r\nthe blossom when I bid thee.' With that he disappeared, and I awoke.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me; do I look mad, to thine eyes?\" Rolla was beginning to feel\r\na little anxious herself.\r\n\r\nCunora got up and led Rolla to the entrance. The glow of \"the\r\nSilvery Way\" was all the help that the girl's catlike eyesight\r\nneeded; she seemed reassured.\r\n\r\n\"Ye look very strange and excited, Rolla, but not mad. Tell me again\r\nwhat thou didst see and hear, that I may compare it with what ye\r\nhave already told.\"\r\n\r\nRolla began again; and meanwhile, on the earth, the doctor's\r\ncompanions telepathically congratulated him on his success. He had\r\nput the great idea into a fertile mind.\r\n\r\nPresently they began to look for other minds. It seemed wise to get\r\nthe notion into as many Sanusian heads as possible. For some hours\r\nthis search proceeded; but in the end, after getting in touch with\r\nsome forty or fifty individuals in as many different parts of the\r\nplanet, they concluded that they had first hit upon the most\r\nadvanced specimens that Sanus afforded; the only ones, in fact,\r\nwhose intellect were strong enough to appreciate the value of what\r\nthey were told. The investigators were obliged to work with Rolla,\r\nDulnop, and Corrus only; upon these three depended the success of\r\ntheir unprecedented scheme.\r\n\r\nRolla continued to keep watch upon Supreme; and toward morning--that\r\nis, morning in that particular part of Sanus--the architect was\r\nrewarded by catching the bee in a still drowsy condition. Using the\r\nsame method Kinney had chosen, Billie succeeded in giving the\r\nsoldier bee a very vivid idea of fire. And judging by the very human\r\nway in which the half-asleep insect tossed about, thrashing her\r\nwings and legs and making incoherent sounds, Billie succeeded\r\nadmirably. The other bees in the hive came crowding around, and\r\nSupreme had some difficulty in maintaining her dignity and\r\nauthority. In the end she confided in the subordinate next in\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n\"I have had a terrible dream. One of our slaves, or a woman much\r\nlike one, assaulted me with a new and fearful weapon.\" She described\r\nit more or less as Rolla had told Cunora. \"It was a deadly thing;\r\nbut how I know this, I cannot say, except that it was exceedingly\r\nhot. So long as the woman held it in her hand, I dared not go near\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"See to it that the others know; and if such a thing actually comes\r\ninto existence, let me know immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Supreme.\" And the soldier straightway took the tale to\r\nanother bee. This told, both proceeded to spread the news,\r\nbee-fashion; so that the entire hive knew of the terror within a few\r\nminutes. Inside an hour every hive in the whole \"city\" had been\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\n\"Give them time now,\" said the doctor, \"and they will tell every bee\r\non the planet. Suppose we want a couple of weeks before doing\r\nanything further? The more afraid the bees are in advance, the\r\neasier for Rolla and her friends.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Corrus, after a sleepless night with his cattle, had\r\ndriven them hurriedly back to the huts surrounding the \"experimental\r\nstation.\" Here the herdsman turned his herd over to another man, and\r\nthen strode over among the huts. Outside one of them--probably\r\nRolla's--he paused and gazed longingly, then gave a deep sigh and\r\nwent on. Shortly he reached another hut in which he found Dulnop.\r\n\r\n\"I was just going to seek ye!\" exclaimed the younger man. \"I have\r\nseen a wondrous sight, Corrus!\"\r\n\r\nThus the two men came to compare notes, finding that each had\r\nlearned practically the same thing. Corrus being denied the right to\r\nvisit any woman save Cunora, Dulnop hurried to Rolla and told her\r\nwhat he and the herdsman had learned. The three testimonies made an\r\nunshakable case.\r\n\r\n\"By the great god Mownoth!\" swore Corrus in vast delight when Dulnop\r\nhad reported. \"We have learned a way to make ourselves free! As free\r\nas the squirrels!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" agreed the younger. \"We know the method. But--how shall we\r\nsecure the means?\"\r\n\r\nCorrus gave an impatient gesture. \"'Twill come in time, Dulnop, just\r\nas the dream came! Meanwhile we must tell every one of our kind, so\r\nthat all shall be ready when the day comes to strike!\r\n\r\n\"Then\"--his voice lost its savagery, and became soft and\r\ntender--\"then, Dulnop, lad, ye shall have thy Cunora; and as for\r\nRolla and I--\"\r\n\r\nCorrus turned and walked away, that his friend might not see what\r\nwas in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nFOUND!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was two weeks to a day when the four on the earth, after having\r\nseen very little of each other in the meanwhile, got together for\r\nthe purpose of finishing their \"revelation\" to the Sanusians.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Van Emmon and I,\" stated Billie coolly, as they put on their\r\nbracelets, \"have been trying to decide upon the best way of telling\r\nthem how to obtain fire.\"\r\n\r\nNeither Smith nor the doctor showed that he noticed her \"Mr. Van\r\nEmmon.\" Evidently the two were still unreconciled.\r\n\r\n\"I argue,\" remarked the geologist, \"that the simplest method will be\r\na chemical one. There's lots of ways to produce fire spontaneously,\r\nwith chemicals; and this woman Rolla could do it easily.\"\r\n\r\nBillie indulged in a small, superior smile. \"He forgets that all\r\nthese chemical methods require pure chemicals. And you don't find\r\nthem pure in the natural state. You've got to have fire to reduce\r\nthem with.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your proposition, then?\" from the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Optics!\" enthusiastically. She produced a large magnifying-glass\r\nfrom her pocket. \"All we have to do is to show Dulnop--he's\r\nsomething of a mineralogist--how to grind and polish a piece of\r\ncrystal into this shape!\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon groaned. \"Marvelous! Say, if you knew how infernally hard\r\nit is to find even a small piece of crystal, you'd never propose\r\nsuch a thing! Why, it would take years--Mrs. Van Emmon!\"\r\n\r\nSmith also shook his head. \"Neither of you has the right idea. The\r\neasiest way, under the circumstances, would be an electrical one.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, frowning hard; then vetoed his own plan. \"Thunder; I'm\r\nalways speaking first and thinking afterward. I never used to do\r\nit,\" accusingly, \"until I got in with you folks. Anyhow, electricity\r\nwon't do; you've got to have practically pure elements for that,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess it's up to you, doc,\" said Billie. And they all looked\r\nrespectfully toward their host.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \"You three will never learn anything. You'll continue to\r\nthink that I'm a regular wonder about these things, but you never\r\nnotice that I merely stay still and let you commit yourselves first\r\nbefore I say anything. All I have to do is select the one idea\r\nremaining after you've disproved the rest. Nothing to it!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused. \"I'm afraid we're reduced to the spark method. It would\r\ntake too long to procure materials pure enough for any other plan.\r\nFriction is out of the question for such people; they haven't the\r\npatience. Suppose we go ahead on the flint-and-spark basis.\"\r\n\r\nThey went at once into the familiar trance state. Nightfall was\r\napproaching on the part of Sanus in which they were interested.\r\nSmith and Van Emmon came upon Dulnop and Corrus as they were talking\r\ntogether. The herdsman was saying:\r\n\r\n\"Lad, my heart is heavy this night.\" Much of his usual vigor was\r\nabsent. \"When I were passing Cunora's field this day, some of the\r\nmasters came and drove me over to her side. I tried to get away, and\r\none threatened to kill. I fear me, lad, they intend to force us to\r\nmarry!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" fiercely, from the younger.\r\n\r\nCorrus laid a hand upon his arm. \"Nay, Dulnop; fear not. I have no\r\nfeeling for thy Cunora; I may marry her, but as for fathering her\r\nchildren--no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" through set teeth, \"suppose They should threaten to kill\r\nthee?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should rather die, Dulnop, than be untrue to Rolla!\"\r\n\r\nThe younger man bounded to his feet. \"Spoken like a man! And I tell\r\nthee, neither shall I have aught to do with Rolla! Rather death than\r\ndishonor!\"\r\n\r\nNext moment silence fell between them; and then Van Emmon and Smith\r\nnoted that both men had been bluffing in what they had said. For,\r\nsitting apart in the growing darkness, each was plainly in terror of\r\nthe morrow. Presently Corrus spoke in a low tone:\r\n\r\n\"All the same, Dulnop, it were well for me and thee if the secret of\r\nthe flowing blossom were given us this night. I\"--he paused,\r\nabashed--\"I am not so sure of myself, Dulnop, when I hear Their\r\naccursed buzzing. I fear--I am afraid I might give in!\"\r\n\r\nAt this Dulnop broke down, and fell to sobbing. Nothing could have\r\ntold the investigators so well just how childlike the Sanusians\r\nreally were. Corrus had all he could do to hold in himself.\r\n\r\n\"Mownoth!\" he exclaimed, his eyes raised fervently. \"If it be thy\r\nwill to deliver us, give us the secret this night!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in Rolla's hut, a similar scene was going on under the\r\ndoctor's projected eye. Cunora lost her nerve, and Rolla came near\r\nto doing the same in her efforts to comfort the other.\r\n\r\n\"They are heartless things!\" Rolla exclaimed with such bitterness as\r\nher nature would permit. \"They know not what love is: They with\r\ntheir drones and their egg-babes! What is family life to Them?\r\nNothing!\r\n\r\n\"Somehow I feel that Their reign is nearly at an end, Cunora.\r\nPerhaps the great secret shall be given us to-night!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl dried her tears. \"Why say ye that, Rolla?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the time be ripe for it. Are not all our kind looking\r\nforward to it? Are we not all expecting and longing for it? Know we\r\nnot that we shall, must, have what we all so earnestly desire?\" It\r\nwas striking, to hear this bit of modern psychology uttered by this\r\nprimitive woman. \"Let me hear no more of thy weeping! Ye shall not\r\nbe made to wed Corrus!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, at the speaking of her lover's name, the older woman's\r\nlips trembled despite themselves; and she said nothing further\r\nbeyond a brief \"Sleep well.\" After which the two women turned in,\r\nand shortly reached the drowsy point.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that Rolla, after a minute or two, once more\r\naroused Cunora in great excitement, and after securely closing the\r\nentrance to the hut against all comers, proceeded to relate what she\r\nhad seen. She finished:\r\n\r\n\"The seed of the flower can be grown in the heart of rotting wood!\"\r\nAnd for hours afterward the two whispered excitedly in the darkness.\r\nIt was hard to have to wait till dawn.\r\n\r\nAs for Corrus and Dulnop, they even went so far as to search the\r\nheaps of stone in the mineral yards, although neither really\r\nexpected to find what they sought.\r\n\r\nBut the four on the earth, not being able to do anything further\r\nuntil morning, proceeded to make themselves at home in the doctor's\r\nhouse. Smith and the doctor slept together, likewise Billie and Mrs.\r\nKinney; Van Emmon occupied the guest-room in lonely grandeur. When\r\nhe came down to breakfast he said he had dreamed that he was Corrus,\r\nand that he had burned himself on a blazing cow.\r\n\r\nAgain in the trance state, the four found that Rolla and Cunora,\r\nafter reaching an understanding with Corrus and Dulnop, had already\r\nleft their huts in search of the required stone. Five bees\r\naccompanied them. Within a few minutes however, Corrus and Dulnop\r\nset out together in the opposite direction, as agreed upon; and\r\nshortly the guards were withdrawn. This meant that the holiday was\r\nofficially sanctioned, so long as the two couples kept apart; but if\r\nthey were to join forces afterward, and be caught in the act, they\r\nwould be severely punished. Such was bee efficiency--and sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had impressed Rolla with the fact that she would find the\r\ndesired stone in a mountainous country. Cunora, however, was for\r\nexamining every rock she came to; Rolla was continually passing\r\njudgment upon some specimen.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said she, for the hundredth time. \"Tis a very bright stone we\r\nseek, very small and very shiny, like sunlight on the water. I shall\r\nknow it when I see it, and I shall see it not until we reach the\r\nmountains.\" Soon Cunora's impatience wore off, and the two\r\nconcentrated upon making time. By midday they were well into the\r\nhills, following the course of a very dry creek; and now they kept a\r\nsharp lookout at every step.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon and Smith had similarly impressed Corrus and Dulnop with\r\nthe result that there was no loss of time in the beginning. The two\r\nmen reached the hills on their side of the valley an hour before the\r\nwomen reached theirs.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the search began, the strangest search, beyond a doubt,\r\nwithin the history of the universe. It was not like the work of some\r\nof earth's prehistoric men, who already knew fire and were merely\r\nlooking up fresh materials; it was a quest in which an idea, an idea\r\ngiven in a vision, was the sole driving force. The most curious part\r\nof the matter was that these people were mentally incapable of\r\nconceiving that there was intelligence at work upon them from\r\nanother world, or even that there was another world.\r\n\r\n\"Ye saw the stars last night?\" Corrus spoke to Dulnop. \"Well,'tis\r\njust such stars as shall awaken the seed of the flower. Ye shall\r\nsee!\"\r\n\r\nBoth knew exactly what to look for: the brassy, regularly cut\r\ncrystals with the black stripings, such as has led countless men to\r\ngo through untold hardships in the belief that they had found gold.\r\nIn fact, iron pyrites is often called \"fool gold,\" so deceptive is\r\nits glitter.\r\n\r\nYet, it was just the thing for the purpose. Flint they already had,\r\nlarge quantities of it; practically all their tools, such as axes\r\nand knives, were made of it. Struck against iron pyrites, a larger,\r\nfatter, hotter spark could be obtained than with any other natural\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nIt was Dulnop's luck to see the outcropping. He found the mineral\r\nexposed to plain view, a few feet above the bottom of the ravine the\r\ntwo were ascending. With a shout of triumph he leaped upon the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Corrus!\" he yelled, dancing like mad. \"Here is the gift of\r\nthe gods!\"\r\n\r\nThe older man didn't attempt to hide his delight. He grabbed his\r\ncompanion and hugged him until his ribs began to crack. Then, with a\r\nsingle blow from his huge club, the herdsman knocked the specimen\r\nclear of the slate in which it was set. Such was their excitement,\r\nneither dreamed of marking the place in any way.\r\n\r\nFirst satisfying themselves that the pyrites really could produce\r\n\"stars\" from the flint, the two hurried down-stream, in search of\r\nthe right kind of wood. In half an hour Corrus came across a dead,\r\nworm-eaten tree, from which he nonchalantly broke off a limb as big\r\nas his leg. The interior was filled with a dry, stringy rot, just\r\nthe right thing for making a spark \"live.\"\r\n\r\nThen came a real difficulty. It will be better appreciated when the\r\nmen's childish nature is borne in mind. Their patience was terribly\r\nstrained in their attempts to make the sparks fly into the tinder.\r\nAgain and again one of them would throw the rocks angrily to the\r\nground, fairly snarling with exasperation.\r\n\r\nHowever, the other would immediately take them up and try again.\r\nNeither man had a tenth the deftness that is common to adults on the\r\nearth. In size and strength alone they were men; otherwise--it\r\ncannot too often be repeated--they were mere children. All told, it\r\nwas over two hours before the punk began to smolder.\r\n\r\n\"By Mownoth!\" swore the herdsman, staring reverently at the smoke.\r\n\"We have done a miracle, Dulnop--ye and I! Be ye sure this is no\r\ndream?\"\r\n\r\nQuite in human fashion, Dulnop seriously reached out and pinched the\r\nherdsman's tremendous arm. Corrus winced, but was too well pleased\r\nwith the result to take revenge, although the nature of these men\r\nwas such as to call for it.\r\n\r\n\"It be no dream!\" he declared, still awestruck.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" agreed Dulnop. \"And now--to make the flower grow!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Corrus's lungs which really did the work. His prodigious\r\nchest was better than a small pair of bellows, and he blew just as\r\nhe had been told in the vision. Presently a small flame appeared in\r\nthe tinder, and leaped eagerly upward. Both men jumped back, and for\r\nlack of enough air the flame went out.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind!\" exclaimed Dulnop at Corrus's crestfallen look. \"I\r\nremember that we must be ready with leaves, and the like, as soon as\r\nthe blossom appears. Blow, ye great wind-maker, and I shall feed the\r\nflower!\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus it came about that two men of Sanus, for the first time in\r\nthe history of the planet, looked upon fire itself. And when they\r\nhad got it to burning well, each of them stared at his hands, and\r\nfrom his hands to the little heap of \"flowers\"; from hands to fire\r\nthey looked, again and again; and then gazed at one another in awe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nAT HALF COCK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRolla and Cunora searched for hours. They followed one creek almost\r\nto its very beginning, and then crossed a ridge on the left and came\r\ndown another stream. Again and again Cunora found bits of mineral\r\nsuch as would have deceived any one who had been less accurately\r\nimpressed than Rolla. As it afterward turned out, the very accuracy\r\nof this impression was a great error, strange though that may seem.\r\nFinally Rolla glanced up at the sun and sighed. \"We will have to\r\ngive it up for this day,\" she told Cunora. \"There be just time\r\nenough to return before night.\" Neither said anything about the\r\nhalf-rations upon which they would be fed in punishment for running\r\naway.\r\n\r\nSo the two started back, making their way in gloomy silence through\r\nthe woods and fields of the valley. Cunora was greatly disappointed,\r\nand soon began to show it as any child would, by maintaining a\r\nsullenness which she broke only when some trifling obstacle, such as\r\na branch, got in her way. Then she would tear the branch from the\r\ntree and fling it as far as she could, meanwhile screaming with\r\nanger. Rolla showed more control.\r\n\r\nIt was nearing nightfall when they came within sight of the huts. At\r\na distance of perhaps half a mile they stopped and stared hard at\r\nthe scene ahead of them.\r\n\r\n\"Hear ye anything, Cunora?\" asked the older woman.\r\n\r\nThe girl's keen ears had caught a sound. \"Methinks something hath\r\naroused our people. I wonder--\"\r\n\r\n\"Cunora!\" gasped Rolla excitedly. \"Think ye that Corrus and Dulnop\r\nhave succeeded in growing the flower?\"\r\n\r\nThey ran nearer. In a moment it was clear that something most\r\ncertainly was arousing the people. The village was in an uproar.\r\n\"Stay!\" cautioned Rolla, catching her friend's arm. \"Let us use\r\ncunning! Mayhap there be danger!\"\r\n\r\nThey were quite alone in the fields, which were always deserted at\r\nthat hour. Crouching behind a row of bushes, they quickly drew near\r\nto the village, all without being seen. Otherwise, this tale would\r\nnever be told.\r\n\r\nFor Corrus and Dulnop, after having satisfied themselves that the\r\nwondrous flowering flower would live as long as they continued to\r\nfeed it, had immediately decided to carry it home. To do so they\r\nfirst tried building the fire on a large piece of bark. Of course it\r\nburned through, and there had been more delay. Finally Corrus\r\nlocated a piece of slate, so large that a small fire could be kept\r\nup without danger of spilling.\r\n\r\nThe two men had hurried straight for the village. Not once did\r\neither of them dream what a magnificent spectacle they made; the two\r\nskin-clad aborigines, bearing the thing which was to change them\r\nfrom slaves into free beings, with all the wonders of civilization\r\nto come in its train. Behind them as they marched, if they but knew\r\nit, stalked the principles of the steam engine, of the printing-press,\r\nof scientific agriculture and mechanical industry in general. Look\r\nabout the room in which you sit as you read this; even to the door-knobs\r\nevery single item depends upon fire, directly or indirectly! But\r\nCorrus and Dulnop were as ignorant of this as their teeth were devoid\r\nof fillings.\r\n\r\nNot until then did it occur to the four watchers on the earth that\r\nthere was anything premature about the affair. It was Smith who\r\nfirst observed:\r\n\r\n\"Say, Van, I never thought to impress Dulnop with any plan for using\r\nthe fire. How about you and Corrus?\"\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" seriously, from the geologist. And immediately the two\r\nset to work trying to reach their agents' minds.\r\n\r\nThey failed! Dulnop and Corrus were both too excited, far too wide\r\nawake, to feel even the united efforts of all four on the earth. And\r\nthe two Sanusians marched straight into the village without the\r\nremotest idea of how they should act.\r\n\r\n\"It is a flower!\" he shrieked, frantic with joy. \"The flower has\r\ncome!\" the shout was passed along. \"Corrus and Dulnop have found the\r\nflowering blossom!\"\r\n\r\nWithin a single minute the two men were surrounded by the whole\r\nhuman population of the place. For the most part the natives were\r\ntoo awestruck to come very near; they were content to stand off and\r\nstare at the marvel, or fall upon their knees and worship it. It was\r\nnow so dark that the flames fairly illumined their faces.\r\n\r\nShortly one or two got up courage enough to imitate Dulnop as he\r\n\"fed the flower;\" and presently there were several little fires\r\nburning merrily upon the ground. As for the aborigines, they let\r\nthemselves loose; never before did they shout and dance as they\r\nshouted and danced that night. It was this Rolla and Cunora heard.\r\n\r\nBefore five minutes had passed, however, a scout awakened Supreme.\r\nBillie could see that the bee was angry at having been disturbed,\r\nbut swiftly collected herself as she realized the significance of\r\nthe scout's report.\r\n\r\n\"So they have found the terror,\" she reflected aloud. \"Very well.\r\nArouse all except the egg-layers and the drones. We can make use of\r\nthe food-gatherers as well as the fighters.\"\r\n\r\nThe hive was soon awake. Billie was sure that every last bee was\r\ngreatly afraid; their agitation was almost pitiful. But such was\r\ntheir organization and their automatic obedience to orders, there\r\nwas infinitely less confusion than might be supposed. Another five\r\nminutes had not passed before not only that hive, but all within the\r\n\"city\" were emptied; and millions upon millions of desperate bees\r\nwere under way toward the village.\r\n\r\nRolla and Cunora knew of it first. They heard the buzzing of that\r\nwinged cloud as it passed through the air above their heads; but\r\nsuch was the bees' intent interest in the village ahead, the two\r\nwomen were not spied as they hid among the bushes. By this time\r\ntwilight was half gone. The firelight lit up the crowd of humans as\r\nthey surged and danced about their new deity. For, henceforth, fire\r\nwould replace Mownoth as their chief god; it was easy to see that.\r\n\r\nMoreover, both Corrus and Dulnop, as primitive people will, had been\r\nirresistibly seized by the spirit of the mob. They threw their\r\nburden down and joined in the frenzy of the dance. Louder and louder\r\nthey shouted; faster and faster they capered. Already one or two of\r\ntheir fellow villagers had dropped, exhausted, to the ground. Never\r\nhad they had so good an excuse for dancing themselves to death!\r\n\r\nAnd into this scene came the bees. Not one of them dared go within\r\nten yards of the flames; for a while, all they did was to watch the\r\nhumans. Such was the racket no one noticed the sound of the wings.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we attack those on the edge of the crowd?\" one of Supreme's\r\nlieutenants wanted to know. The commandant considered this with all\r\nthe force of what mental experience she had had.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she decided. \"We shall wait a little longer. Just now, they\r\nare too jubilant to be frightened; we would have to kill them all,\r\nand that would not be good policy.\" Of course, the bee had the\r\npollen crop, nothing more, in mind when she made her decision; yet\r\nit was further justified. There was no let-up in the rejoicing; if\r\nanything, it became more frantic than before. Darkness fell upon a\r\ncrowd which was reeling in self-induced mental intoxication.\r\n\r\nRolla and Cunora came a little nearer; and still remaining hidden,\r\nsaw that more than half their friends had succumbed. One by one the\r\nremainder dropped out; their forms lay all about what was left of\r\nthe fire. The two women could easily see what their friends were\r\nblind to: the bees were simply biding their time.\r\n\r\n\"Ought we not to rush in and warn them?\" whispered Cunora to Rolla.\r\n\"Surely the flower hath driven them mad!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" warned the older woman. \"Be quiet! Everything depends upon\r\nour silence!\"\r\n\r\nIt was true. Only two of the villagers remained upon their feet, and\r\nshortly one of these staggered and fell in his tracks. The one who\r\nwas left was Corrus himself, his immense vitality keeping him going.\r\nThen he, too, after a final whoop of triumph and defiance,\r\nabsolutely unconscious of the poison-laden horde that surrounded\r\nhim, fell senseless to the earth. Another minute, and the whole\r\ncrowd was still.\r\n\r\nAND THE FIRE HAD GONE OUT.\r\n\r\nThe bees came closer. Several thousands of them were stricken by\r\nsmoke from the embers, and the rest of the swarm took good care to\r\navoid it. They hovered over the prostrate forms of the aborigines\r\nand made sure that they were unconscious.\r\n\r\n\"Is there nothing we can do?\" whispered Cunora, straining her eyes\r\nto see.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, save to watch and wait,\" returned Rolla, her gaze fixed\r\nupon the dark heap which marked her lover's form. And thus an hour\r\npassed, with the four on the earth quite unable to take a hand in\r\nany way.\r\n\r\nThen one of the villagers--the first, in fact, who had dropped out\r\nof the dance--stirred and presently awakened. He sat up and looked\r\nabout him, dazed and dizzy, for all the world like a drunken man.\r\nAfter a while he managed to get to his feet.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he done this than a dozen bees were upon him.\r\nTerror-stricken, he stood awaiting their commands. They were not\r\nlong in coming.\r\n\r\nBy means of their fearful buzzing, the deadly insects guided him\r\ninto the nearest hut, where they indicated that he should pick up\r\none of the rude hoelike tools which was used in the fields. With\r\nthis in hand, he was driven to the little piles of smoldering ashes,\r\nwhere the fires had flickered an hour before.\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what he was doing, but not daring to disobey, the man\r\nproceeded to heap dirt over the embers. Shortly he had every spark\r\nof the fire smothered beneath a mound as high as his knees. Not till\r\nthen did any of the others begin to revive.\r\n\r\nAs fast as they recovered the bees took charge of them. Not a human\r\nhad courage enough to make a move of offense; it meant certain\r\ndeath, and they all knew it only too well. As soon as they were wide\r\nawake enough to know what they were doing, they were forced to\r\nsearch the bodies of those still asleep.\r\n\r\n\"We must find the means for growing the flower,\" said Supreme,\r\nevidently convinced that a seed was a seed, under any circumstances.\r\nAnd presently they found, tucked away in Corrus's lion-skin, a large\r\nchunk of the pyrites, and a similar piece on Dulnop.\r\n\r\n\"So these were the discoverers,\" commented Supreme.\r\n\r\n\"What is your will in their case?\" the subordinate asked.\r\n\r\nThe commanding bee considered for a long time. Finally she got an idea,\r\nsuch as bees are known to get once in a great while. It was simply a\r\nnew combination--as all ideas are merely new combinations--of two\r\npunishments which were commonly employed by the bees.\r\n\r\nAs a result, eight of the villagers were compelled to carry the two\r\nfire-finders to a certain spot on the bank of a nearby stream. Here\r\nthe two fragments of pyrites were thrown, under orders, into the\r\nwater; so that the eight villagers might know just why the whole\r\nthing was being done. Next the two men, still unconscious, were\r\nburied up to their necks. Their heads, lolling helplessly, were all\r\nthat was exposed. So it was to be the Head Out punishment--imprisonment\r\nof one day with their bodies rigidly held by the soil: acute torture\r\nto an aborigine. But was this all?\r\n\r\nOne of the villagers was driven to the nearest hut, where he was\r\nforced to secure two large stone axes. Bringing these back to the\r\n\"torture-place,\" as the spot was called, the man was compelled to\r\nwield one of the clumsy tools while a companion used the other; and\r\nbetween them they cut down the tree whose branches had been waving\r\nover the prisoners' heads. Then the villagers were forced to drag\r\nthe tree away.\r\n\r\nAll of which occurred in the darkness, and out of sight of Rolla and\r\nCunora. They could only guess what was going on. Hours passed, and\r\ndawn approached. Not till then did they learn just what had been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe villagers, now all awake, were driven by the bees to the place\r\non the bank of the stream. There, the eight men who had imprisoned\r\nthe two discoverers told what had been done with the \"magic stones.\"\r\nEach villager stared at the offenders, and at something which lay on\r\nthe ground before them, and in sober silence went straight to his or\r\nher work in the fields.\r\n\r\nPresently the huts were deserted. All the people were on duty\r\nelsewhere. Such bees as were not guarding the fields had returned to\r\nthe hives. Rolla and Cunora cautiously ventured forth, taking great\r\ncare to avoid being seen. They hurried fearfully to the stream.\r\n\r\nBefore they reached the spot Rolla gave an exclamation and stared\r\ncuriously to one side, where the tree had been dragged. Suddenly she\r\ngave a terrible cry and rushed forward, only to drop on her knees\r\nand cover her face with hands that shook as with the palsy. At the\r\nsame instant Cunora saw what had been done; and uttering a single\r\npiercing scream, fell fainting to the ground.\r\n\r\nHeaped in front of the two prisoners was a large pile of pebbles.\r\nThere were thousands upon thousands in the heap. Before each man, at\r\na distance of a foot, was a large gourd-ful of water. To the\r\nsavages, these told the whole story; these, together with the tree\r\ndragged to one side.\r\n\r\nCorrus and Dulnop were to be buried in that spot every day for as\r\nmany days as there were pebbles in the heap; in other words, until\r\nthey died. Every night they would be dug up, and every morning\r\nburied afresh. And to keep them from telling any of the villagers\r\nwhere they had found the pyrites, they were to be deprived of water\r\nall day long. By night their tongues would be too swollen for\r\nspeech. For they had been sentenced to the No Shade torture, as\r\nwell; their heads would be exposed all day long to the burning sun\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE EDGE OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is significant that Billie, because of her connection with the\r\nbee, Supreme, was spared the sight that the doctor saw from Rolla's\r\npoint of view. Otherwise, the geologist's wife might have had a\r\ndifferent opinion of the matter. As it was--\r\n\r\n\"Corrus and Dulnop,\" said she as cooly as Supreme herself might have\r\nspoken, \"are not the first to suffer because they have discovered\r\nsomething big.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon her husband's wrath got beyond his grip. \"Not the first!\r\nIs that all you can say?\" he demanded hotly. \"Why, of all the\r\ndamnably cruel, cold-blooded creatures I ever heard of, those\r\ninfernal bees--\"\r\n\r\nVan Emmon stopped, unable to go on without blasphemy.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had got over the horror of what he had seen. \"We want to\r\nbe fair, Van. Look at this matter from the bees' view-point for\r\nawhile. What were they to do? They had to make sure, as far as\r\npossible, that their supremacy would never be threatened again.\r\nDidn't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but--damn it all!\" cried Van Emmon. \"There's a limit somewhere!\r\nSuch cruelty as that--no one could conceive of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"As for the bees,\" flared Billie, \"I don't blame 'em! And unless I'm\r\nvery much mistaken, the ruling class anywhere, here on the earth or\r\nwherever you investigate, will go the limit to hold the reins, once\r\nthey get them!\"\r\n\r\nThe expression on Van Emmon's face was curious to see. There was no\r\nfear there, only a puzzled astonishment. Strange as it may seem,\r\nBillie had told him something that had never occurred to him before.\r\nAnd he recognized it as truth, as soon as she had said it.\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute,\" remarked Smith in his ordinary voice; \"just a\r\nminute. You're forgetting that we don't really know whether Rolla\r\nand Cunora are safe. Everything depends upon them now, you know.\"\r\n\r\nIn silence the four went back into telepathic connection. Now, of\r\ncourse, Smith and Van Emmon were practically without agents. The\r\nprisoners could tell them nothing whatever except the tale of\r\nincreasing agony as their torture went on. All that Van Emmon and\r\nSmith could do was lend the aid of their mentality to the efforts of\r\nthe other two, and for a while had to be content with what Billie,\r\nthrough Supreme, and the doctor, through Rolla, were able to learn.\r\nHowever, Kinney did suggest that one of the other two men get in\r\ntouch with Cunora.\r\n\r\n\"Good idea,\" said Smith. \"Go to it, Van Emmon.\"\r\n\r\nThe geologist stirred uneasily, and avoided his wife's eyes. \"I--I'm\r\nafraid not, Smith. Rather think I'd prefer to rest a while. You do\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nSmith laughed and reddened. \"Nothing doing for an old bach like me.\r\nCunora might--well, you know--go in bathing, for instance. It's all\r\nright for the doctor, of course; but--let me out!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two women on Sanus, taking the utmost care, managed to\r\nretreat from the river bank without being discovered. Keeping their\r\neyes very wide open and their ears strained for the slightest buzz,\r\nthe two contrived to pass through the village, out into the fields,\r\nand thence, from cover to cover, into the foothills on that side of\r\nthe valley where their lovers had found the pyrites.\r\n\r\n\"If only we knew which stream they ascended!\" lamented Cunora, as\r\nthey stood in indecision before a fork in the river.\r\n\r\n\"But we don't!\" Rolla pointed out philosophically. \"We must trust to\r\nluck and Mownoth, ye and I.\"\r\n\r\nAnd despite all the effort the doctor could put forth to the\r\ncontrary, the two women picked out the wrong branch. They searched\r\nas diligently as two people possibly could; but somehow the doctor\r\nknew, just because of the wrong choice that had been made, that\r\ntheir search would be unsuccessful. He thought the matter over for a\r\nfew moments, and finally admitted to his three friends:\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if I haven't been a little silly? Why should I have been\r\nso precious specific in impressing Rolla about the pyrites? Pshaw!\r\nAlmost any hard rock will strike sparks from flint!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course!\" exploded Van Emmon. \"Here--let's get busy and tell\r\nRolla!\"\r\n\r\nBut it proved astonishingly difficult. The two women were in an\r\nextraordinary condition now. They were continually on the alert. In\r\nfact, the word \"alert\" scarcely described the state of mind, the\r\nkeen, desperate watchfulness which filled every one of their waking\r\nhours, and caused each to remain awake as long as possible; so that\r\nthey invariably fell to sleep without warning. They could not be\r\ncaught in the drowsy state!\r\n\r\nFor they knew something about the bees which the four on the earth\r\ndid not learn until Billie had overheard Supreme giving some orders.\r\n\r\n\"Set a guard on that river bank,\" she told her subordinate, \"and\r\nmaintain it night and day. If any inferior attempts to recover the\r\nmagic stone, deal with him or her in the same manner in which we\r\npunished the finders of the deadly flower.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be done, Supreme. Is there anything further?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Make quite sure that none of the inferiors are missing.\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterward the lieutenant reported that one of the huts was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n\"Rolla, the soil-tester, and Cunora, the vineyardist, are gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seek them!\" Supreme almost became excited. \"They are the lovers of\r\nthe men we punished! They would not absent themselves unless they\r\nknew something! Find them, and torture them into revealing the\r\nsecret! We must weed out this flowing blossom forever!\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be done!\"\r\n\r\nSuch methods were well known to Rolla and Cunora. Had not their\r\nfellow villagers, many of them, tried time after time to escape from\r\nbondage? And had they not inevitably been apprehended and driven\r\nback, to be tortured as an example to the rest? It would never do to\r\nbe caught!\r\n\r\nSo they made it a practice to travel only during twilight and dawn,\r\nremaining hidden through the day. Invariably one stood watch while\r\nthe other slept. The bees were--everywhere!\r\n\r\nUpon crossing the range of mountains going down the other side,\r\nCunora and Rolla began to feel hopeful of two things--first, that\r\ntheir luck would change, and the wonderful stone be found; and\r\nsecond, that they would be in no danger from the bees in this new\r\ncountry, which seemed to be a valley much like the one they had\r\nquit. It was all quite new and strange to them, and in their\r\ninterest they almost forgot at times that each had a terrible score\r\nto settle when her chance finally came.\r\n\r\nTwice they had exceedingly narrow escapes. Always they kept\r\ncarefully hid, but on the third day Cunora, advancing cautiously\r\nthrough some brush, came suddenly upon two bees feeding. She stopped\r\nshort and held her breath. Neither saw her, so intent were they upon\r\ntheir honey; yet Cunora felt certain that each had been warned to\r\nwatch out for her. This was true; Billie learned that every bee on\r\nthe planet had been told. And so Cunora silently backed away, an\r\ninch at a time, until it was safe to turn and run.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Rolla surprised a big drone bee, just as she\r\nbent to take a drink of water from a stream. The insect had been out\r\nof her sight, on the other side of a boulder. It rose with an angry\r\nbuzz as she bent down; a few feet away from her it hung in the air,\r\napparently scrutinizing her to make sure that she was one of the\r\nrunaways. Her heart leaped to her mouth. Suppose they were reported!\r\n\r\nShe made a lightninglike grab at the thing, and very nearly caught\r\nit. Straight up it shot, taken by surprise, and dashed blindly into\r\na ledge of rock which hung overhead. For a second it floundered,\r\ndazed; and that second was its last. Cunora gave a single bound\r\nforward, and with a vicious swing of a palm-leaf, which she always\r\ncarried, smashed the bee flat.\r\n\r\nBefore they had been free five days they came to an exceedingly\r\nserious conclusion: that it was only a question of time until they\r\nwere caught. Sooner or later they must be forced to return; they\r\ncould not hope to dodge bees much longer. When Rolla fully realized\r\nthis she turned gravely to the younger girl.\r\n\r\n\"Methinks the time has come for us to make a choice, Cunora. Which\r\nshall it be: live as we have been living for the past four days,\r\nwith the certainty of being caught in time or--face the unknown\r\nperils on the edge of the world?\"\r\n\r\nCunora dropped the piece of stone she had been inspecting and\r\nshivered with fear. \"A dreadful choice ye offer, Rolla! Think of the\r\nhorrible beasts we must encounter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye mean\"--corrected the philosophical one--\"ye mean, the beasts\r\nwhich men SAY they have seen. Tell me; hast ever seen such thyself?\r\nMany times hast thou been near the edge, I know.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl shook her head. \"Nay; not I. Yet these beasts must be,\r\nRolla; else why should all men tell of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I note,\" remarked Rolla thoughtfully, \"that each man tells of\r\nseeing a different sort of beast. Perchance they were all but lies.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it was Cunora's fear of capture, rather than her faith in\r\nRolla's reasoning, which drove the girl to the north. For to the\r\nnorth they traveled, a matter of some two weeks; and not once did\r\nthey dare relax their vigilance. Wherever they went, there was\r\nvegetation of some sort, and wherever there was vegetation bees were\r\nlikely to be found. By the time the two weeks were over, the women\r\nwere in a state of near-hysteria, from the nervous strain of it all.\r\nMoreover, both suffered keenly for want of cereals, to which they\r\nwere accustomed; they were heartily tired of such fruits and nuts as\r\nthey were able to pick up without exposing themselves.\r\n\r\nOne morning before daybreak they came to the upper end of a long,\r\nnarrow valley--one which paralleled their own, by the way--and as\r\nthey emerged from the plain into the foothills it was clear that\r\nthey had reached a new type of country. There was comparatively\r\nlittle brush; and with every step the rockiness increased. By dawn\r\nthey were on the edge of a plateau; back of them stretched the\r\ninhabited country; ahead, a haze-covered expanse. Nothing but rocks\r\nwas about them.\r\n\r\n\"Ye are sure that we had best keep on?\" asked Cunora uneasily.\r\n\r\nRolla nodded, slowly but positively. \"It is best. Back of us lies\r\ncertain capture. Ahead--we know not what; but at least there is a\r\nchance!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, both hesitated before starting over the plateau. Each\r\ngazed back longingly over the home of their kind; and for a moment\r\nHolla's resolution plainly faltered. She hesitated; Cunora made a\r\nmove as though to return. And at that instant their problem was\r\ndecided for them.\r\n\r\nA large drone passed within six feet of them. Both heard the buzz,\r\nand whirled about to see the bee darting frantically out of reach.\r\nAt a safe distance it paused, as though to make sure of its find,\r\nthen disappeared down the valley. They had been located!\r\n\r\n\"We have no choice now!\" cried Rolla, speaking above a whisper for\r\nthe first time in weeks. \"On, as fast as ye can, Cunora!\"\r\n\r\nThe two sped over the rocks, making pretty good time considering the\r\nloads they carried. Each had a good-sized goatskin full of various\r\ndried fruits and nuts, also a gourd not so full. In fact, it had\r\nbeen some while since they had had fresh water. Cunora was further\r\nweighed down by some six pounds of dried rabbit meat; the animals\r\nhad been caught in snares. Both, however, discarded their palm\r\nleaves; they would be of no further use now.\r\n\r\nAnd thus they fled, knowing that they had, at most, less than a day\r\nbefore the drone would return with enough soldiers to compel\r\nobedience. For the most part, the surface was rough granite, with\r\nvery little sign of erosion. There was almost no water; both women\r\nshowed intense joy when they found a tiny pool of it standing in a\r\ncrevasse. They filled their gourds as well as their stomachs.\r\n\r\nA few steps farther on, and the pair stepped out of the shallow\r\ngully in which they had been walking. Immediately they were exposed\r\nto a very strong and exceedingly cold wind, such as seemed to\r\nsurprise them in no way, but compelled both to actually lean against\r\nits force. Moreover, although this pressure was all from the left,\r\nit proved exceedingly difficult to go on. Their legs seemed made of\r\nlead, and their breathing was strangely labored. This, also,\r\nappeared to be just what they had expected.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, they found another slight depression in the\r\nrocks; and sheltered from the wind, made a little better progress\r\nahead. It was bitter cold, however; only the violence of their\r\nexercise could make them warm enough to stand it. All in all, the\r\ntwo were considerably over three hours in making the last mile; they\r\nhad to stop frequently to rest. The only compensating thing was\r\ntheir freedom from worry; the bees would not bother them where the\r\nwind was so strong. So long as they could keep on the move they were\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nBut what made it worse was the steadily increasing difficulty of\r\nmoving their legs. For, although the surface continued level, they\r\nseemed to be CLIMBING now, where before they had simply walked. It\r\nwas just as though the plateau had changed into a mountain, and they\r\nwere ascending it; only, upon looking back, nothing but\r\ncomparatively flat rock met the gaze. What made them lean forward so\r\nsteeply anyhow?\r\n\r\nRolla seemed to think it all very ordinary. She was more concerned\r\nabout the wind, to which they had become once more exposed as they\r\nreached the end of the rift. On they pressed, five or six steps at\r\neach attempt, stopping to rest twice the length of time they\r\nactually traveled. It was necessary now to cling to the rock with\r\nboth hands, and once Cunora lost her grip, so that she would have\r\nbeen blown to one side, or else have slipped backward, had not Rolla\r\ngrasped her heel and held her until she could get another hand-hold.\r\n\r\n\"Courage!\" gasped Rolla. Perspiration was streaming down her face,\r\ndespite the bitter cold of the wind; her hands trembled from the\r\nstrain she was undergoing. \"Courage, Cunora! It be not much\r\nfarther!\"\r\n\r\nOn they strove. Always it seemed as though they were working upward\r\nas well as onward, although the continued flatness of the surface\r\nargued obstinately against this. Also, the sun remained in the same\r\nposition relative to the rocks; if they were climbing, it should\r\nhave appeared overhead. What did it mean?\r\n\r\nFinally Rolla saw, about a hundred yards farther on, something which\r\ncaused her to shout: \"Almost there, Cunora!\"\r\n\r\nThe younger girl could not spare breath enough to reply. They\r\nstruggled on in silence.\r\n\r\nNow they were down on their hands and knees. Before half the hundred\r\nyards was covered, they were flat on their faces, literally clawing\r\ntheir way upward and onward. Had the wind increased in violence in\r\nproportion as the way grew harder, they could never have made it,\r\nphysical marvels though they were. Only the absolute knowledge that\r\nthey dared not return drove them on; that, and the possibility of\r\nfinding the precious stone, and of ultimately saving the two men\r\nthey had left behind.\r\n\r\nThe last twenty feet was the most extraordinary effort that any\r\nhuman had ever been subjected to. They had to take turns in\r\nnegotiating the rock; one would creep a few inches on, get a good\r\nhold, and brace herself against the wind, while the other, crawling\r\nalongside, used her as a sort of a crutch. Their fingers were\r\nbleeding and their finger-nails cracked from the rock and cold; the\r\nsame is equally true of their toes. Had it been forty feet instead\r\nof twenty--\r\n\r\nThe rocks ended there. Beyond was nothing but sky; even this was not\r\nlike what they were used to, but was very nearly black. Two more\r\nspurts, and Rolla threw one hand ahead and caught the edge of the\r\nrock. Cunora dragged herself alongside. The effort brought blood to\r\nher nostrils.\r\n\r\nThey rested a minute or two, then looked at one another in mute\r\ninquiry. Cunora nodded; Rolla took great breath; and they drew\r\nthemselves to the edge and looked over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two women gazed in extreme darkness. The other side of the ridge\r\nof rock was black as night. From side to side the ridge extended,\r\nlike a jagged knife edge on a prodigious scale; it seemed infinite\r\nin extent. Behind them--that is, at their feet--lay the\r\nstone-covered expanse they had just traversed; ahead of them there\r\nwas--nothingness itself.\r\n\r\nCunora shook with fear and cold. \"Let us not go on, Rolla!\" she\r\nwhimpered. \"I like not the looks of this void; it may contain all\r\nsorts of beasts. I--I am afraid!\" She began to sob convulsively.\r\n\r\nRolla peered into the darkness. Nothing whatever was to be seen. It\r\nwas as easy to imagine enemies as friends; easier in fact. What\r\nmight not the unknown hold for them?\r\n\r\n\"We cannot stay here,\" spoke Rolla, with what energy her condition\r\nwould permit. \"We could not--hold on. Nor can we return now; They\r\nwould surely find us!\"\r\n\r\nBut Cunora's courage, which had never faltered in the face of\r\nfamiliar dangers, was not equal to the unknown. She wailed: \"Rolla!\r\nA little way back--a hollow in the rock! 'Tis big enough to shelter\r\nme! I would--rather stay there than--go on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye would rather die there, alone!\"\r\n\r\nCunora hid her face. \"Let me have half the food! I can go back to\r\nthe pool--for water! And maybe,\" hopefully--\"maybe They will give\r\nup the search in time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" from Rolla, bitterly. \"And in time Dulnop will die, if we do\r\nnothing for him--and for Corrus!\"\r\n\r\nCunora fell to sobbing again. \"I cannot help it! I am--afraid!\"\r\n\r\nRolla scarcely heard. An enormous idea had just occurred to her. She\r\nhad told the girl to think of Dulnop and Corrus; but was it not\r\nequally true that they should think of all the other humans, their\r\nfellow slaves, each of whom had suffered nearly as much? Was not the\r\nfire equally precious to them all?\r\n\r\nShe started to explain this to the girl, then abruptly gave it up.\r\nIt was no use; Cunora's mind was not strong enough to take the step.\r\nRolla fairly gasped as she realized, as no Sanusian had realized\r\nbefore, that she had been given the responsibility of rescuing A\r\nWHOLE RACE.\r\n\r\nFire she must have! And since she could not, dared not, seek it\r\nhere, she must try the other side of the world. And she would have\r\nto do it--alone!\r\n\r\n\"So be it!\" she said loudly in a strange voice. \"Ye stay here and\r\nwait, Cunora! I go on!\"\r\n\r\nAnd for fear her resolution would break down, she immediately crept\r\nover the edge. She clung to the rock as though expecting to be\r\ndragged from it. Instead, as she let her feet down into the\r\nblackness, she could feel solid rock beneath her body, quite the\r\nsame as she had lain upon a moment before. It was like descending\r\nthe opposite side of an incredibly steep mountain, a mountain made\r\nof blackness itself.\r\n\r\nThe women gave one another a last look. For all they knew, neither\r\nwould gaze upon the other again. Next moment, with Cunora's\r\ndespairing cry ringing in her ears, Holla began to crawl backward\r\nand downward.\r\n\r\nShe could plainly see the sun's level rays above her head, irregular\r\nbeams of yellowish light; it served slightly to illuminate her\r\nsurroundings. Shortly, however, her eyes became accustomed to the\r\ndarkness; the stars helped just as they had always helped; and soon\r\nshe was moving almost as freely as on the other side.\r\n\r\nOnce she slipped, and slid down and to one side, for perhaps ten\r\nfeet. When she finally grabbed a sharp projecting ledge and stopped,\r\nher vision almost failed from the terrible effort she had put forth.\r\nShe could scarcely feel the deep gash that the ledge had made in her\r\nfinger-tips.\r\n\r\nAfter perhaps half an hour of hard work among bare rocks exactly\r\nlike those she had quit, she stopped for a prolonged rest. As a\r\nmatter of course, she stared at the sky; and then came her first\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nOnce more let it be understood that her view was totally different\r\nfrom anything that has ever been seen on the earth. To be sure, \"up\"\r\nwas over her head, and \"down\" was under her feet; nevertheless, she\r\nwas stretched full length, face down, on the rock. In other words,\r\nit was precisely as though she were clinging to a cliff. Sky above,\r\nsky behind and all sides; there were stars even under her feet!\r\n\r\nBut all her life she had been accustomed, at night, to see that\r\nbroad band of silver light across the heavens. She had taken it for\r\ngranted that, except at two seasons of the year, for short periods,\r\nshe would always see \"the Silvery Way.\" But tonight--there was no\r\nband! The whole sky was full of--stars, nothing else!\r\n\r\nIt will be easier to picture her wonder and uneasiness if she is\r\ncompared mentally with a girl of five or six. Easier, too, to\r\nappreciate the fact that she determined to go on anyhow.\r\n\r\nMile after mile was covered in the darkness. Rolla was on the point\r\nof absolute exhaustion; but she dared not sleep until she reached a\r\nspot where there was no danger of falling. It was only after braving\r\nthe gale for over four hours in the starlight that Rolla reached a\r\npoint where she was no longer half crawling, half creeping, but\r\nmoved nearly erect. Shortly she was able to face the way she was\r\ngoing; and by leaning backward was able to make swift progress. In\r\nanother half-hour she was walking upright. Still no explanation of\r\nthe mystery!\r\n\r\nFinding a sheltered spot, she proceeded to make herself\r\ncomparatively comfortable on the rock. Automatically, from habit,\r\nshe proceeded to keep watch; then she must have remembered that\r\nthere was now no need for vigilance. For she lay herself down in the\r\ndarkness and instantly fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThree hours later--according to the time kept by the watchers on the\r\nearth--Rolla awoke and sat up in great alarm. And small wonder.\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight! The sun was well above the horizon; and not\r\nonly the Sanusian but the people on the earth were vastly puzzled to\r\nnote that it was the western horizon! To all appearances, Rolla had\r\nslept a whole day in that brief three hours.\r\n\r\nShortly her nerves were steady enough for her to look about,\r\nuncomprehendingly, but interestedly, as a child will. There was\r\nnothing but rock to be seen; a more or less level surface, such as\r\nshe had toiled over the day before. The day before! She glanced at\r\nthe sun once more, and her heart gave a great leap.\r\n\r\nThe sun was rising--in the west!\r\n\r\n'\"Tis a world of contraries,\" observed Rolla sagely to herself.\r\n\"Mayhap I shall find all else upside down.\"\r\n\r\nShe ate heartily, and drank deep from her gourd. There was not a\r\ncupful remaining. She eyed it seriously as she got to her feet.\r\n\r\nAnother look back at that flat expanse of granite, which had so\r\ngradually and so mysteriously changed from precipice to plain, and\r\nRolla strode on with renewed vigor and interest. Presently she was\r\nable to make out something of a different color in the distance, and\r\nsoon was near enough to see some bona-fide bushes; a low, flowerless\r\nshrub, it is true, but at least it was a living thing.\r\n\r\nShortly the undergrowth became dense enough to make it somewhat of\r\nan effort to get through. And before long she was noticing all\r\nmanner of small creatures, from bugs to an occasional wandering\r\nbird. These last, especially, uttered an abrupt but cheerful chirp\r\nwhich helped considerably to raise her spirits. It was all too easy\r\nto see, in her fancy, her lover helpless and suffering in the power\r\nof those cold-blooded, merciless insects.\r\n\r\nIn an hour or two she reached the head of a small stream. Hurrying\r\ndown its banks as rapidly as its undergrowth would permit, Rolla\r\nfollowed its course as it bent, winding and twisting, in the\r\ndirection which had always been north to her, but which the sun\r\nplainly labeled \"south.\" Certainly the sun mounted steadily toward\r\nthe zenith, passing successively through the positions corresponding\r\nto four, three and two o'clock, in a manner absolutely baffling.\r\n\r\nAbout noon she came out of the canon into the foothills. Another\r\nbrief rest, and from the top of a knoll she found herself looking\r\nupon a valley about the size of the one she called \"home.\"\r\nOtherwise, it was very different. For one thing, it was far better\r\nwatered; nowhere could she see the half-dried brownishness so\r\ncharacteristic of her own land. The whole surface was heavily grown\r\nwith all manner of vegetation; and so far as she could see it was\r\nall absolutely wild. There was not a sign of cultivation.\r\n\r\nKeeping to the left bank of the river, a much broader affair than\r\nany she had seen before, Rolla made her way for several miles with\r\nlittle difficulty. Twice she made wide detours through the thicket,\r\nand once it was necessary to swim a short distance; the stream was\r\ntoo deep to wade. The doctor watched the whole affair, purely as a\r\nmatter of professional interest.\r\n\r\n\"She is a magnificent specimen physically,\" he said in his\r\nimpersonal way, \"and she shows none of the defects of the African\r\nsavages.\"\r\n\r\nAnd such was his manner, in speaking of his distant \"patient,\" that\r\nBillie took it entirely as a matter of course, without the slightest\r\nself-consciousness because of Van Emmon and Smith.\r\n\r\nAll this while Rolla had been intent, as before, upon finding some\r\nof the coveted crystals. She had no luck; but presently she\r\ndiscovered something decidedly worth while--a fallen tree trunk, not\r\ntoo large, and near enough to the bank to be handled without help. A\r\nfew minutes later she was floating at ease, and making decidedly\r\nbetter time.\r\n\r\nA half-hour of this-during which she caught glimpses of many\r\nanimals, large and small, all of which fled precipitately--and she\r\nrounded a sharp bend in the stream, to be confronted with a sight\r\nwhich must have been strange indeed to her. Stretching across the\r\nriver was--a network of rusty wire, THE REMAINS OF A REINFORCED\r\nCONCRETE BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt of this. On each bank was a large, moss-grown\r\nblock of stone, which the doctor knew could be nothing else than the\r\nold abutments. Seemingly there had been only a single span.\r\n\r\nThe woman brought the log to the shore, and examined the bridge\r\nclosely. Instinctively she felt that the structure argued a high\r\ndegree of intelligence, very likely human. A little hesitation, and\r\nthen she beached her log, ascended the bank, and looked upon the\r\nbridge from above.\r\n\r\nA narrow road met her eyes. Once it might have been twice as wide,\r\nbut now the thicket encroached until there was barely room enough,\r\njudged the doctor, for a single vehicle to pass. Its surface was\r\nbadly broken up--apparently it had been concrete--and grass grew in\r\nevery crack. Nevertheless, it was a bona-fide road.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in a long while, Rolla was temporarily off her\r\nguard. The doctor was able to impress her with the idea of \"Follow\r\nthis road!\" and to his intense gratification the woman started away\r\nfrom the river at once.\r\n\r\nSoon the novelty of the thing wore off enough for her to concern\r\nherself with fresh food. She discovered plenty of berries, also\r\nthree kinds of nuts; all were strange to her, yet she ate them\r\nwithout question, and suffered nothing as a result, so far as the\r\ndoctor could see.\r\n\r\nThe sun was less than an hour from the horizon when the road, after\r\npassing over a slight rise, swung in a wide arc through the woods\r\nand thus unveiled a most extraordinary landscape. It was all the\r\nmore incredible because so utterly out of keeping with what Rolla\r\nhad just passed through. She had been in the wilderness; now--\r\n\r\nA vast city lay before her. Not a hundred yards away stood a low,\r\nsquare building of some plain, gray stone. Beyond this stretched\r\nblock upon block--mile upon mile, rather--of bona-fide residences,\r\nstores and much larger buildings. It is true that the whole place\r\nwas badly overgrown with all sorts of vegetation; yet, from that\r\nslight elevation, there was no doubt that this place was, or had\r\nbeen, a great metropolis.\r\n\r\nPresently it became clear that \"had been\" was the correct term.\r\nNothing but wild life appeared. Rolla looked closely for any signs\r\nof human occupancy, but saw none. To all appearances the place was\r\ndeserted; and it was just as easy to say that it had been so for ten\r\ncenturies as for one.\r\n\r\n\"There seems no good reason why I should not go farther,\" commented\r\nRolla aloud, to boost her courage. \"Perchance I shall find the magic\r\nstone in this queer place.\"\r\n\r\nIt speaks well for her self-confidence that, despite the total\r\nstrangeness of the whole affair--a city was as far out of her line\r\nas aviation to a miner--she went forward with very little\r\nhesitation. None of the wild creatures that scuttled from her sight\r\nalarmed her at all; the only things she looked at closely were such\r\nbees as she met. The insects ignored her altogether, except to keep\r\na respectful distance.\r\n\r\n\"These masters,\" observed Rolla with satisfaction, \"know nothing of\r\nme. I shall not obey them till they threaten me.\" But there was no\r\nthreatening.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the buildings were in ruins. Here and there a\r\nstructure showed very little damage by the elements. In more than\r\none case the roof was quite intact. Clearly the materials used were\r\nexceptional, or else the place had not been deserted very long. The\r\ndoctor held to the latter opinion, especially after seeing a certain\r\nbrown-haired dog running to hide behind a heap of stones.\r\n\r\n\"It was a dog!\" the doctor felt sure. To Rolla, however, the animal\r\nwas even more significant. She exclaimed about it in a way which\r\nconfirmed the doctor's guess. On she went at a faster rate, plainly\r\nexcited and hopeful of seeing something further that she could\r\nrecognize.\r\n\r\nShe found it in a hurry. Reaching the end of one block of the ruins,\r\nshe turned the corner and started to follow the cross street.\r\nWhereupon she stopped short, to gaze in consternation at a line of\r\nsomething whitish which stretched from one side of the \"street\" to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIt was a line of human skeletons.\r\n\r\nThere were perhaps two hundred in the lot, piled one on top of the\r\nother, and forming a low barrier across the pavement. To Rolla the\r\nthing was simply terrible, and totally without explanation. To the\r\npeople on the earth, it suggested a formation of troops, shot down\r\nin their tracks and left where they had fallen. The doctor would\r\nhave given a year of his life if only Rolla had had the courage to\r\nexamine the bones; there might have been bullet holes, or other\r\nevidence of how they had met their death.\r\n\r\nThe Sanusian chose rather to back carefully away from the spot. She\r\nwalked hurriedly up the street she had just left, and before going\r\nanother block came across two skeletons lying right in the middle of\r\nthe street. A little farther on, and she began to find skeletons on\r\nevery hand. Moreover--and this is especially significant--the\r\nbuildings in this locality showed a great many gaps and holes in\r\ntheir walls, such as might have been made by shell-fire.\r\n\r\nThis made it easier to understand something else. Every few yards or\r\nso the explorer found a large heap of rust in the gutter, or what\r\nhad once been the gutter. These heaps had little or no shape; yet\r\nthe doctor fancied he could detect certain resemblances to things he\r\nhad seen before, and shortly declared that they were the remains of\r\nmotors.\r\n\r\n\"Can't say whether they were aircraft or autos, of course,\" he\r\nadded, \"but those things were certainly machines.\" Later, Rolla paid\r\nmore attention to them, and the doctor positively identified them as\r\nformer motor-cars.\r\n\r\nThe sun had gone down. It was still quite light, of course; darkness\r\nwould not come for a couple of hours. Rolla munched on what food she\r\nhad, and pressed on through the ruins. She saw skeletons and rusted\r\nengines everywhere, and once passed a rounded heap of rust which\r\nlooked like nothing so much as a large cannon shell. Had the place\r\nbeen the scene of a battle?\r\n\r\nJust when she had got rather accustomed to the place and was feeling\r\nmore or less at her ease, she stopped short. At the same time the\r\ndoctor himself fairly jumped in his chair. Somewhere, right near at\r\nhand, on one of the larger structures, a bell began to ring!\r\n\r\nIt clanged loudly and confidently, giving out perhaps thirty strokes\r\nbefore it stopped. The stillness which followed was pretty painful.\r\nIn a moment, however, it was broken as effectively as any silence\r\ncan be broken.\r\n\r\nA man's voice sounded within the building.\r\n\r\nImmediately it was replied to, more faintly, by several others. Then\r\ncame the clatter of some sort of utensils, and sundry other noises\r\nwhich spoke loudly of humans. Rolla froze in her tracks, and her\r\nteeth began to chatter.\r\n\r\nNext moment she got a grip on herself. \"What difference doth it\r\nmake, whether they be friend or enemy?\" she argued severely, for the\r\nbenefit of her shaking nerves. \"They will give thee food, anyhow.\r\nAnd perchance they know where liveth the magic stone!\"\r\n\r\nIn the end Rolla's high purpose prevailed over her weak knees, and\r\nshe began to look for the entrance to the place. It was partly in\r\nruins-that is, the upper stories-but the two lower floors seemed, so\r\nfar as their interior could be seen through the high, unglazed\r\nwindows, to be in good condition. There were no doors on that\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nGoing around the corner, however, Rolla saw a high archway at the\r\nfar corner of the structure. Approaching near enough to peek in, she\r\nsaw that this arch provided an opening into a long corridor, such as\r\nmight once have served as a wagon or auto entrance. After a little\r\nhesitation she went in.\r\n\r\nShe passed a door, a massive thing of solid brassy metal, such as\r\ninterested the doctor immensely but only served to confuse the\r\nexplorer. A little farther on, and the corridor became pretty dark.\r\nShe passed another brass door, and approached the end of the\r\npavement. There was one more door there; and she noted with\r\nexcitement that it was open.\r\n\r\nShe came closer and peered in. The room was fairly well lighted, and\r\nwhat she saw was clear-cut and unmistakable. In the middle of the\r\nroom was a long table, and seated about it, in perfect silence, sat\r\nan even dozen men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE TWELVE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two Rolla was not observed. She simply stood and\r\nstared, being neither confident enough to go forward nor scared\r\nenough to retreat. Childlike, she scrutinized the group with great\r\nthoroughness.\r\n\r\nTheir comparatively white faces and hands puzzled her most. Also,\r\nshe could not understand the heavy black robes in which all were\r\ndressed. Falling to the floor and reaching far above their necks,\r\nsuch garments would have been intolerable to the free-limbed\r\nSanusians. To the watchers on the earth, however, the robes made the\r\ngroup look marvelously like a company of monks.\r\n\r\nNot that there was anything particularly religious about the place\r\nor in their behavior. All twelve seemed to be silent only because\r\nthey were voraciously hungry. A meal was spread on the table. Except\r\nfor the garments, the twelve might have been so many harvest hands,\r\ngathered for the evening meal in the cook-house. From the\r\nwhite-bearded man who sat at the head of the table and passed out\r\nlarge helpings of something from a big pot, to the fair-haired young\r\nfellow at the foot, who could scarcely wait for his share, there was\r\nonly one thing about them which might have been labeled pious; and\r\nthat was their attitude, which could have been interpreted: \"Give us\r\nthis day our daily bread--and hurry up about it!\"\r\n\r\nApparently Rolla was convinced that these men were thoroughly human,\r\nand as such fairly safe to approach. For she allowed her curiosity\r\nto govern her caution, and proceeded to sidle through the doorway.\r\nHalf-way through she caught a whiff of the food, and her sidling\r\nchanged to something faster.\r\n\r\nAt that instant she was seen. A tall, dark-haired chap on the far\r\nside of the table glanced up and gave a sharp, startled exclamation.\r\nInstantly the whole dozen whirled around and with one accord shot to\r\ntheir feet.\r\n\r\nRolla stopped short.\r\n\r\nThere was a second's silence; then the white-bearded man, who seemed\r\nto be the leader of the group, said something peremptory in a deep,\r\ncompelling voice. Rolla did not understand.\r\n\r\nHe repeated it, this time a little less commandingly; and Rolla,\r\nafter swallowing desperately, inclined her head in the diffident way\r\nshe had, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Are ye friends or enemies?\"\r\n\r\nEleven of the twelve looked puzzled. The dark-haired man, who had\r\nbeen the first to see her, however, gave a muttered exclamation;\r\nthen he cogitated a moment, wet his lips and said something that\r\nsounded like: \"What did you say? Say it again!\"\r\n\r\nRolla repeated.\r\n\r\nThe dark-haired man listened intently. Immediately he fell to\r\nnodding with great vigor, and thought deeply again before making\r\nanother try: \"We are your friends. Whence came ye, and what seek\r\nye?\"\r\n\r\nRolla had to listen closely to what he said. The language was\r\nsubstantially the same as hers; but the verbs were misplaced in the\r\nsentences, the accenting was different, and certain of the vowels\r\nwere flatted. After a little, however, the man caught her way of\r\ntalking and was able to approximate it quite well, so that she\r\nunderstood him readily.\r\n\r\n\"I seek,\" Rolla replied, \"food and rest. I have traveled far and am\r\nweary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye look it,\" commented the man. His name, Rolla found out later,\r\nwas Somat. \"Ye shall have both food and rest. However, whence came\r\nye?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the other side of the world,\" answered Rolla calmly.\r\n\r\nInstantly she noted that the twelve became greatly excited when\r\nSomat translated her statement. She decided to add to the scene.\r\n\r\n\"I have been away from my people for many days,\" and she held up one\r\nhand with the five fingers spread out, opening and closing them four\r\ntimes, to indicate twenty.\r\n\r\n\"Ye came over the edge of the world!\" marveled Somat. \"It were a\r\ndangerous thing to do, stranger!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" agreed Rolla, \"but less dangerous than that from which I\r\nfled. However,\" impatiently, \"give me the food ye promised; I can\r\ntalk after my stomach be filled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of a surety,\" replied Somat apologetically. \"I were too interested\r\nto remember thy hunger.\" He spoke a word or two, and one of his\r\ncompanions brought another stool, also dishes and table utensils.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the watchers on the earth got a first-class surprise. Here\r\nthey had been looking upon twelve men, living in almost barbaric\r\nfashion amid the ruins of a great city; but the men had been eating\r\nfrom hand-painted china of the finest quality, and using silverware\r\nthat was simply elegant, nothing less! Luxury in the midst of\r\ndesolation!\r\n\r\nRolla, however, paid little attention to these details. She was\r\nscarcely curious as to the food, which consisted of some sort of\r\nvegetable and meat stew, together with butterless bread, a kind of\r\nsmall-grained corn on the cob, a yellowish root-vegetable not unlike\r\nturnips, and large quantities of berries. She was too hungry to be\r\nparticular, and ate heartily of all that was offered, whether cooked\r\nor uncooked. The twelve almost forgot their own hunger in their\r\ninterest in the stranger.\r\n\r\nIt was now pretty dark in the big room. The white-bearded man said\r\nsomething to the young fellow at the foot of the table, whereupon\r\nthe chap got up and stepped to the nearest wall, where he pressed\r\nsomething with the tip of his finger. Instantly the room was flooded\r\nwith white light--from two incandescent bulbs!\r\n\r\nRolla leaped to her feet in amazement, bunking painfully in the\r\nunaccustomed glare.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" she demanded, all the more furiously to hide her\r\nfear. \"Ye would not trick me with magic; ye, who call yourselves\r\nfriends!\"\r\n\r\nSomat interpreted this to the others. Some laughed; others looked\r\npityingly at her. Somat explained:\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing, stranger. Be not afraid. We forgot that ye might\r\nknow nothing of this 'magic.'\" He considered deeply, apparently\r\ntrying to put himself in her place. \"Know ye not fire?\" Of course,\r\nshe did not know what he meant. \"Then,\" with an inspiration,\r\n\"perchance ye have see the flower, the red flower, ye might call--\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye!\" eagerly. \"Doth it grow here?\"\r\n\r\nSomat smiled with satisfaction, and beckoned for her to follow him.\r\nHe led the way through a small door into another room, evidently\r\nused as a kitchen. There he pointed to a large range, remarkably\r\nlike the up-to-date article known on the earth.\r\n\r\n\"The flower 'groweth' here,\" said he, and lifted a lid from the\r\nstove. Up shot the flame.\r\n\r\n\"Great Mownoth!\" shouted Holla, forgetting all about her hunger. \"I\r\nhave found it--the precious flower itself!\"\r\n\r\nSomat humored her childlike view-point. \"We have the seed of the\r\nflower, too,\" said he. He secured a box of matches from a shelf, and\r\nshowed her the \"little sticks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly what the angel showed me!\" jubilated Holla. \"I have come to\r\nthe right place!\"\r\n\r\nBack she went to her food, her face radiant, and all her lurking\r\nsuspicion of the twelve completely gone. From that time on she had\r\nabsolute and unquestioning confidence in all that was told her. In\r\nher eyes, the twelve were simply angels or gods who had seen fit to\r\nclothe themselves queerly and act human.\r\n\r\nSupper over, she felt immensely tired. All the strain of the past\r\nthree weeks had to have its reaction. Like a very tired, sleepy\r\nchild, she was led to a room in another part of the building, where\r\nshe was shown an ordinary sleeping-cot. She promptly pulled the\r\nmattress onto the floor, where she considered it belonged, and fell\r\nfast asleep.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, back on the earth, Van Emmon and Smith had lost no time\r\nin making use of the doctor's description of the twelve. Within a\r\nfew minutes they had new agents; Van Emmon used Somat's eyes and\r\nears, while Smith got in touch with the elderly bearded man at the\r\nhead of the table. His name was Deltos.\r\n\r\n\"A very striking confirmation of the old legends,\" he was saying\r\nthrough a big yawn, as Smith made connection. He used a colloquial\r\ntype of language, quite different from the lofty, dignified speech\r\nof the Sanusians. \"That is, of course, if the woman is telling the\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I think she is,\" declared the young fellow at the foot of the\r\ntable. \"It makes me feel pretty small, to think that none of us ever\r\nhad the nerve to make the trip; while she, ignorant as she is, dared\r\nit all and succeeded!\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, Sorplee,\" reminded Somat, \"that such people are far\r\nhardier than we. The feat is one that requires apelike ability. The\r\nonly thing that puzzled me is--why did she do it at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will have to remain a puzzle until she awakens,\" said Deltos,\r\nrising from the table. \"Lucky for us, Somat, that you saw fit to\r\nstudy the root tongues. Otherwise we'd have to converse by signs.\"\r\n\r\nNeither Smith nor Van Emmon learned anything further that night. The\r\ntwelve were all very tired, apparently, and went right to bed; a\r\nprocedure which was straightway seconded by the four watchers on the\r\nearth. Which brings us in the most ordinary manner to the events of\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast all but Somat left the place and disappeared in\r\nvarious directions; and Rolla noted that the robes were, evidently,\r\nworn only at meal time. Most of the men were now dressed in rough\r\nworking garments, similar to what one sees in modern factories.\r\nWhimsical sort of gods, Rolla told herself, but gods just the same.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" began Somat, as the woman sat on the floor before him--he\r\ncould not get her to use a chair--\"tell me, what caused thee to\r\nleave thy side of the world? Did ye arouse the wrath of thy fellow\r\ncreatures?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" answered Rolla, and proceeded to explain, in the wrong order,\r\nas a child might, by relating first the crossing of the ridge, the\r\nflight from the bees, the \"masters'\" cruel method of dealing with\r\nCorrus and Dulnop, and finally the matter of the fire itself, the\r\nreal cause of the whole affair. Somat was intelligent enough to fill\r\nin such details as Rolla omitted.\r\n\r\n\"Ye did right, and acted like the brave girl ye are!\" he exclaimed,\r\nwhen Rolla had finished. However, he did not fully appreciate what\r\nshe had meant by \"the winged masters,\" and not until she pointed out\r\nsome bees and asked if, on this part of the planet, such were the\r\nrulers of the humans, that the man grasped the bitter irony of it\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"What! Those tiny insects rule thy lives!\" It took him some time to\r\ncomprehend the deadly nature of their stings, and the irresistible\r\npower of concerted effort; but in the end he commented: \"'Tis not so\r\nstrange, now that I think on it. Mayhap life is only a matter of\r\nchance, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nPresently he felt that he understood the Sanusian situation. He fell\r\nsilent; and Rolla, after waiting as long as her patience would\r\nallow, finally put the question temporarily uppermost in her mind:\r\n\r\n\"It is true that I have crossed the edge of the world. And yet, I\r\nunderstand it not at all. Can ye explain the nature of this strange\r\nworld we live upon, Somat?\" There was infinite respect in the way\r\nRolla used his name; had she known a word to indicate human\r\ninfallibility, such as \"your majesty,\" she would have used it.\r\n\"There is a saying among our people that the world be round. How can\r\nthis be so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet it is true,\" answered Somat, \"although ye must know that it be\r\nnot round like a fruit or a pebble. No more is it flat, like this,\"\r\nindicating the lid of the stove, near which they sat. \"Instead, 'tis\r\nshaped thus\"--and he took from his finger a plain gold band, like an\r\nordinary wedding ring--\"the world is shaped like that!\"\r\n\r\nRolla examined the ring with vast curiosity. She had never seen the\r\nlike before, and was quite as much interested in the metal as in the\r\nthing it illustrated. Fortunately the band was so worn that both\r\nedges were nearly sharp, thus corresponding with the knifelike ridge\r\nover which she had crawled.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" Somat went on, \"ye and your people live on the inner face of\r\nthe world,\" indicating the surface next his skin, \"while I and my\r\nkind live on the outer face. Were it not for the difficulties of\r\nmaking the trip, we should have found you out ere this.\"\r\n\r\nRolla sat for a long time with the ring in her hand, pondering the\r\ngreat fact she had just learned. And meanwhile, back on the earth,\r\nfour excited citizens were discussing this latest discovery.\r\n\r\n\"An annular world!\" exclaimed the doctor, his eyes sparkling\r\ndelightedly. \"It confirms the nebular hypothesis!\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" Smith wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Because it proves that the process of condensation and\r\nconcentration, which produces planets out of the original gases can\r\ntake place at uneven speeds! Instead of concentrating to the\r\nglobular form, Sanus cooled too quickly; she concentrated while she\r\nwas still a ring!\"\r\n\r\nSmith was struck with another phase of the matter. \"Must have a\r\nqueer sort of gravitation,\" he pointed out. \"Seems to be the same,\r\ninside the ring or outside. Surely, doc it can't be as powerful as\r\nit is here on the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, why hasn't it made a difference in the inhabitants? Seems to\r\nme the humans would have different structure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily. Look at it the other way around; consider what an\r\nenormous variety of animal forms we have here, all developed under\r\nthe same conditions. The humming-bird and the python, for instance.\r\nGravitation needn't have anything to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nBillie was thinking mainly of the question of day and night. \"The\r\nring must be inclined at an angle with the sun's rays,\" she\r\nobserved. \"That being the case, Sanus has two periods each year when\r\nthere is continuous darkness on the inner face; might last a week or\r\ntwo. Do you suppose the people all hibernate during those seasons?\"\r\nBut no one had an answer to that.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon said he would give all he was worth to explore the\r\nSanusian mountains long enough to learn their geology. He said that\r\nthe rocks ought to produce some new mineral forms, due to the\r\npeculiar condition of strain they would be subjected to.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" said he thoughtfully, \"but I shouldn't be surprised\r\nif there's an enormous amount of carbon there. Maybe diamonds are as\r\nplentiful as coal is here.\"\r\n\r\nAt the word \"diamonds\" Smith glanced covertly at Billie's left hand.\r\nBut she had hidden it in the folds of her skirt. Next moment the\r\ndoctor warned them to be quiet; Somat and Rolla were talking again.\r\n\r\nHe was telling her about his world. She learned that his people, who\r\nhad never concerned themselves with her side of the planet, had\r\nprogressed enormously beyond the Sanusians. Rolla did not understand\r\nall that he told her; but the people on the earth gathered, in one\r\nway or another, that civilization had proceeded about as far as that\r\nof the year 1915 in Europe. All this, while fellow humans only a few\r\nthousand miles away, not only failed to make any progress at all,\r\nbut lived on, century after century, the absolute slave of a race of\r\nbees!\r\n\r\nBut it was a fact. The ancient city in which Rolla found herself had\r\nbeen, only a generation before, a flourishing metropolis, the\r\ncapital of a powerful nation. There had been two such nations on\r\nthat side of the planet, and the most violent rivalry had existed\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\"However,\" Somat told Rolla, \"'twas not this rivalry which wrought\r\ntheir downfall, except indirectly. The last great war between them\r\nwas terrible, but not disastrous. Either could have survived that.\r\n\r\n\"But know you that the ruler of one of the nations, in order to\r\ncarry on this war--which was a war of commerce (never mind what that\r\nmeans)--in order to carry it on was obliged to make great\r\nconcessions to his people. In the other nation, the ruler oppressed\r\nthe workers, instead, and drove them mad with his cruelty. So that,\r\nnot long after the end of the war, there was a great rebellion among\r\nthe people who had been so long oppressed, and their government was\r\noverthrown.\"\r\n\r\nBack on the earth the four investigators reflected on this in\r\namazement. The case was wonderfully like that of Russia after the\r\ngreat war. Perhaps--\r\n\r\n\"Immediately the other nation forced its soldiers to fight the\r\nvictorious rebels. But at home the workers had tasted of power. Many\r\nrefused to work at all; and one day, behold, there were two\r\nrebellions instead of one! And within a very short time the whole\r\nworld was governed by--the working class!\"\r\n\r\nSo this was what the Venusians had meant when they wrote that Sanus\r\nwas ruled by the workers!\r\n\r\n\"What became of these rebellions?\" Rolla asked, little understanding\r\nwhat it meant, but curious anyhow.\r\n\r\n\"Devastation!\" stated Somat solemnly. He waved a hand, to include\r\nall that lay within the ruined city. \"Not altogether because of the\r\nworkers, although they were scarcely fit for ruling but because the\r\nformer rulers and others of that kind, who liked to oppose their\r\nwills upon others, saw fit to start a fresh rebellion. Conflict\r\nfollowed conflict; sometimes workers were in power, and sometimes\r\naristocrats. But the fighting ended not until\"--he drew a deep\r\nbreath--\"until there were none left to fight!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye mean,\" demanded Rolla incredulously, \"that your people killed\r\nthemselves off in this fashion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" sorrowfully. \"There were a few of us--they called us 'the\r\nmiddle class'--who urged equality. We wanted a government in which\r\nall classes were represented fairly; what we called a democracy.\r\nOnce the experiment was started, but it failed.\r\n\r\n\"Saw ye the skeletons in the streets?\" he went on. \"'Twas a dreadful\r\nsight, those last few days. I were but a lad, yet I remember it all\r\ntoo well.\" He paused, then broke out fiercely: \"I tell ye that I saw\r\nbrother slay brother, father slay son, son slay mother, in those\r\nlast days!\r\n\r\n\"Lucky am I that I fled, I and my parents! They took me to a\r\nmountainous country, but even there the madness spread, and one day\r\na soldier of the army killed my father and my mother. He sought me,\r\nalso, that he might slay me; but I hid from him beneath a heap of\r\nmanure. Aye,\" he gritted savagely, \"I owe my life to a pile of\r\nmanure!\r\n\r\n\"These other eleven men all have like tales to tell. Only one woman\r\nsurvived those awful days. Young Sorplee is her son; his father was\r\na soldier, whom she herself slew with her own hands. Even she is now\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he finished, after a long pause, \"when the madness had spent\r\nitself, we who remained came from our hiding-places to find our\r\nworld laid waste. 'Tis now thirty years since Sorplee's mother died,\r\nsince we first looked upon these ruins, and we have made barely a\r\nbeginning. We have little heart for the work. Of what use is it,\r\nwith no women to start the race afresh?\"\r\n\r\nRolla started despite herself. Was this the reason why she, despite\r\nher savagery, had been made so welcome?\r\n\r\n\"Ye have not told me,\" said she hurriedly, \"why ye and the others\r\nall wear such curious garments when ye eat.\"\r\n\r\nSomat was taken off his guard. He had been chuckling to himself at\r\nthe woman's childlike mind. Now he had to look apologetic and not a\r\nlittle sheepish as he made reply:\r\n\r\n\"The robes are a mere custom. It were started a great many years\r\nago, by the founders of a--a--\" He tried to think of a simpler\r\nexpression than \"college fraternity.\" \"A clan,\" he decided. \"All of\r\nwe men were members of that clan.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" pursued Rolla, \"will ye give me the magic stone, that I may\r\ntake the flowing blossoms back to my people, and release my loved\r\none from the masters' cruelty?\" The great question was put! Rolla\r\nwaited in tremulous anxiety for the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, stranger!\" replied Somat vigorously. \"More; ye shall have some\r\nof the little sticks!\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Rolla leaped to her feet and danced in sheer delight.\r\nSomat looked on and marveled. Then, abruptly, he got up and marched\r\naway. He had not seen a woman in thirty years; and he was a man of\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nThat night, when the twelve were again seated at the table, Somat\r\nrelated this conversation with Rolla. Since he used his own\r\nlanguage, of course she did not understand what was said. \"And I\r\ntold her,\" he concluded, \"how we came to be here; also the reason\r\nfor the condition of things. But I doubt if she understood half what\r\nI said. We have quite a problem before us,\" he added. \"What shall we\r\ndo about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean this woman?\" Deltos asked. Rolla was busy with her food.\r\n\"It seems to me, brothers, that Providence has miraculously come to\r\nour aid. If we can handle her people rightly the future of the race\r\nis assured.\"\r\n\r\nSomat thought it was simple enough. \"All we need to do is send this\r\nwoman back with a supply of matches, and implicit instructions as to\r\nhow best to proceed against the bees. Once released, their friends\r\ncan make their way over the edge and settle among us. Let the bees\r\nkeep their country.\"\r\n\r\nThe two who had seconded him before again showed agreement. Sorplee\r\nand Deltos, however, together with the other seven, were distinctly\r\nopposed to the method. \"Somat,\" protested Deltos, as though\r\nsurprised, \"you forget that there's an enormous population over\r\nthere. Let them come in of their own free will? Why, they would\r\noverrun our country! What would become of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd have to take our chances, replied Somat energetically, \"like\r\ngood sports! If we can't demonstrate our worth to them, enough to\r\nhold their respect, we'd deserve to be snowed under!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not while I'm alive!\" snarled Sorplee. \"If they come here, they've\r\ngot to give up their wilderness ways, right off! We can't stand\r\nsavagery! The safest thing for us, and the best for them, is to make\r\nan industrial army of 'em and set 'em to work!\" His enthusiasm was\r\nboundless.\r\n\r\n\"I must say,\" admitted Deltos, with his usual dignity, \"that you\r\nhave the right idea, Sorplee. If I had stated it, however, I should\r\nhave been more frank about it. The arrangements you propose simply\r\nmeans that we are to take possession of them!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" shouted Somat, horrified.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course! Make slaves of them! What else?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE RAID\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite all that Somat and his two backers could say, the other nine\r\nmen swiftly agreed upon the thing Deltos had proposed. Somat went so\r\nfar as to declare that he would warn Rolla; but he was instantly\r\ngiven to understand that any such move would be disastrous to\r\nhimself. In the end he was made to agree not to tell her.\r\n\r\n\"We aren't going to let you and your idealism spoil our only chance\r\nto save the race!\" Sorplee told him pugnaciously; and Somat gave his\r\nword. At first he hoped that the nine might fall out among\r\nthemselves when it came to actually enslaving the Sanusians; but he\r\nsoon concluded that, if there was any difference of opinion, the\r\naristocratic element would take charge of half the captives, while\r\nSorplee's friends commandeered the rest. The outlook was pretty\r\nblack for Rolla's friends; yet there was nothing whatever to do\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nAmong the four people on the earth, however, the thing was being\r\ndiscussed even more hotly. Van Emmon found himself enthusiastically\r\nbacking Somat, the liberal-minded one.\r\n\r\n\"He's got the right idea,\" declared the geologist. \"Let the\r\nSanusians come over of their own free will! Let the law of\r\ncompetition show what it can do! Dandy experiment!\"\r\n\r\nSmith could not help but put in: \"Perhaps it's Deltas and Sorplee\r\nwho are right, Van. These Sanusians are mere aborigines. They\r\nwouldn't understand democratic methods.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\" politely, from the doctor. \"Now, from what I've seen of Rolla,\r\nI'll say she's a perfect example of 'live-and-let-live.' Nothing\r\neither subservient or autocratic in her relations with other people.\r\nGenuinely democratic, Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" remarked Billie, with exaggerated nonchalance,\r\n\"meanwhile, what about the bees? Are they going to be permitted to\r\nshow their superiority or not?\" Van Emmon took this to be aimed at\r\nhim. \"Of course not! We can't allow a race of human beings to be\r\ndominated forever by insects!\r\n\r\n\"I say, let's get together and put Rolla wise to what Deltos and\r\nSorplee are framing up! We can do it, if we concentrate upon the\r\nsame thought at the right time!\"\r\n\r\nSmith did not commit himself. \"I don't care much either way,\" he\r\ndecided. \"Go ahead if you want to\"--meaning Van Emmon and the\r\ndoctor--\"I don't want to butt in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't need you,\" growled the geologist. \"Two of us is enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so?\" sarcastically, from Billie. \"Well, it'll take more\r\nthan two of you to get it over to Rolla!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" hotly.\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" with deliberation,--\"that if you and the doctor try to\r\ninterfere I'll break up our circle here!\" They stared at her\r\nincredulously. \"I sure will! I'm not going to lend my mental\r\ninfluence for any such purpose!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear,\" protested the doctor gently, \"you know how it is: the\r\ncombined efforts of the four of us is required in order to keep in\r\ntouch with Sanus. Surely you would not--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I would!\" Billie was earnestness itself. \"Mr. Van Emmon\r\nwas so good as to blame me for what I did in that Capellette mix-up;\r\nnow, if you please, I'm going to see to it that this one, anyhow,\r\nworks itself out without our interference!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be darned!\" The geologist looked again, to make sure it\r\nwas really his wife who had been talking thus. \"I'm mighty glad to\r\nknow that you're not intending to warn Supreme, anyhow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I shall! snapped Bilhe.\r\n\r\n\"If you do,\" stated the doctor quietly, \"then I'll break the circle\r\nmyself.\" They looked at him with a renewal of their former respect\r\nas he concluded emphatically: \"If you won't help us stop this slave\r\nraid, Billie, then, by George, you'll at least let the bees fight it\r\nout on their own!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the matter stood, so far as the investigators were concerned.\r\nThey were to be lookers-on, nothing more.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the survivors of a once great civilization prepared to\r\nmove in person against the bees. They did this after Deltos had\r\npointed out the advantages of such a step.\r\n\r\n\"If we rout the bees ourselves,\" said he, \"the natives will regard\r\nus as their saviors, and we shall have no trouble with them\r\nafterward.\"\r\n\r\nThis was sound policy; even Somat had to admit it. He had decided to\r\nbe a member of the expedition, for the reason that Rolla flatly\r\nrefused to accompany the other men unless he, her special god, went\r\nalong. His two liberal-minded friends stayed behind to take care of\r\ntheir belongings in the ruined city.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was a simple one. It consisted of a single large auto\r\ntruck and trailer, the only items of automotive machinery that the\r\ntwelve had been able to reconstruct from the ruins. However, these\r\nserved the purpose; they carried large supplies of food, also means\r\nfor protection against the bees, together with abundant material for\r\nrouting them. A large quantity of crude explosives also was\r\nincluded. The trailer was large enough to seat everybody; and the\r\nten men of the party had a good deal of amusement watching Rolla as\r\nshe tried to get accustomed to that land of travel. She was glad\r\nenough when the end of the road was reached and the truck began to\r\npush its way into the wilderness, giving her an excuse to walk.\r\n\r\nNo need to describe the trip in detail. Within three days the truck\r\nwas as far as it could go up the rock wall of the \"edge.\" The point\r\nselected was about twenty miles west of where Cunora was hid, and\r\ndirectly opposite the upper end of her home valley. No attempt was\r\nmade to go over the top as Rolla had done; instead, about two miles\r\nbelow the ridge a crevasse was located in the granite; and by means\r\nof some two tons of powder a narrow opening was made through to the\r\nother side. Through it the men carried their supplies on their\r\nbacks, transferring everything to improvised sleds, a hundred pounds\r\nto a man.\r\n\r\nWhile this was being done, Rolla hurried east and located Cunora.\r\nThe girl was in a pitiful condition from lack of proper food, and\r\ncomparative confinement and constant strain. But during Rolla's\r\nabsence she had seen none of the bees.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do now?\" she asked Rolla, after the explorer\r\nhad told her story.\r\n\r\nRolla shrugged her shoulders indifferently. \"These gods,\" she\r\ndeclared with sublime confidence, \"can do no wrong! Whatever they\r\npropose must be for the best! I have done my part; now it is all in\r\nthe hands of the Flowing Blossom!\"\r\n\r\nNot until they reached the head of the valley which had been her\r\nhome did Rolla ask Somat as to the plan. He answered:\r\n\r\n\"Ye and the other woman shall stay here with me, on this hill.\" He\r\nproduced a telescope. \"We will watch with this eye-tube. The other\r\nnine men will go ahead and do the work.\"\r\n\r\n\"And will they separate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay. They intend to conquer this colony first; then, after your\r\npeople are freed and safely on the way to my country, the conquerors\r\nwill proceed to the next valley, and so on until all are released.\"\r\nHe kept his word not to warn Rolla of the proposed captivity. \"In\r\nthat way the fear of them will go ahead and make their way easy.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the nine were getting ready for their unprecedented\r\nconquest. They put on heavy leather clothes, also leather caps,\r\ngloves and boots. Around their faces were stiff wire nets, such as\r\nannoyed them all exceedingly and would have maddened Cunora or\r\nRolla. But it meant safety.\r\n\r\nAs for weapons, they relied entirely upon fire. Each man carried a\r\nlittle wood alcohol in a flask, in case it was necessary to burn wet\r\nor green wood. Otherwise, their equipment was matches, with an\r\nemergency set of flint and steel as well. There could be no\r\nresisting them.\r\n\r\n\"We'll wait here till we've seen that you've succeeded,\" Somat told\r\nDeltos and Sorplee. \"Then we'll follow.\"\r\n\r\nThe nine left the hills. The hours passed with Rolla and Cunora\r\namusing themselves at the \"eye-tube.\" They could see the very spot\r\nwhere their lovers were being punished; but some intervening bushes\r\nprevented seeing the men themselves. The other villagers were at\r\nwork quite as usual; so it was plain that, although the bees were\r\ninvisible, yet they were still the masters.\r\n\r\nHardly had the nine reached the first low-growing brush before they\r\nencountered some of the bees. None attempted to attack, but turned\r\nabout and flew back to report. It was not long before Supreme, and\r\ntherefore Billie, knew of the approaching raiders.\r\n\r\n\"They are doubtless provided with the magic flower,\" Supreme told\r\nher lieutenants. \"You will watch the blossom as it sways in the\r\nwind, and keep always on the windward side of it. In this way you\r\ncan attack the inferiors.\"\r\n\r\nThe word was passed, bee-fashion, until every soldier and worker in\r\nthe colony knew her duty. The stingers were to keep back and watch\r\ntheir chance, while the workers harrassed the attackers. Moreover,\r\nwith the hives always uppermost in her mind, Supreme planned to keep\r\nthe actual conflict always at a distance from the \"city.\"\r\n\r\nIt was late in the day when the nine reached the stream in whose bed\r\nrested the pyrites taken from Corrus and Dulnop. This stream, it\r\nwill be remembered, flowed not far from the torture-place. Deltos's\r\nplan was to rescue these two men before doing anything else; this,\r\nbecause it would strengthen the villagers' regard for the\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\nThe bees seemed to sense this. They met the invaders about three\r\nmiles above the village, in an open spot easily seen by the people\r\nwith the telescope. And the encounter took place during twilight,\r\njust early enough to be visible from a distance, yet late enough to\r\nmake the fire very impressive.\r\n\r\n\"Remember, it's the smoke as much as the flame,\" Deltos shouted to\r\nthe others. \"Just keep your torches on the move, and make as much\r\nfuss as you can!\"\r\n\r\nNext moment the swarm was upon them. It was like a vast cloud of\r\nsoot; only, the buzzing of those millions of wings fairly drowned\r\nout every other sound. The nine had to signal to one another;\r\nshouting was useless.\r\n\r\nWithin a single minute the ground was covered with bees, either dead\r\nor insensible from the smoke. Yet the others never faltered. At\r\ntimes the insects battered against the wire netting with such force,\r\nand in such numbers, that the men had to fight them away in order to\r\nget enough air.\r\n\r\nSupreme watched from above, and kept sending her lieutenants with\r\nfresh divisions to first one man and then another, as he became\r\nseparated from the rest. Of course, nobody suffered but the bees.\r\nNever before had they swarmed a creature which did not succumb; but\r\nthese inferiors with the queer things over their faces, and the\r\ncows' hides over their bodies and hands, seemed to care not at all.\r\nSupreme was puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Keep it up,\" she ordered. \"They surely cannot stand it much\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be done!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the bees were driven in upon the men, again and again. Always\r\nthe torches were kept waving, so that the insects never could tell\r\njust where to attack. Always the men kept moving steadily\r\ndown-stream; and as they marched they left in their wake a black\r\npath of dead and dying bees. Half of them had been soldier bees,\r\ncarrying enough poison in their stings to destroy a nation. Yet,\r\nnine little matches were too much for them!\r\n\r\nPresently the invaders had approached to within a half-mile of the\r\ntorture-place. One of Supreme's lieutenants made a suggestion:\r\n\r\n\"Had we not better destroy the men, rather than let them be\r\nrescued?\"\r\n\r\nThe commandant considered this fully. \"No,\" she decided. \"To kill\r\nthem would merely enrage the other villagers, and perhaps anger them\r\nso much as to make them unmanageable.\" More than once a human had\r\nbeen driven so frantic as to utterly disregard orders. \"We cannot\r\nslay them all.\"\r\n\r\nThe bees attacked with unabated fury. Not once did the insects\r\nfalter; orders were orders, and always had been. What mattered it if\r\ndeath came to them, so long as the Hive lived? For that is bee\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just when it seemed that the wisest thing would be to\r\nwithdraw, Supreme got the greatest idea she had ever had. For once\r\nshe felt positively enthusiastic. Had she been a human she would\r\nhave yelled aloud for sheer joy.\r\n\r\n\"Attention!\" to her subordinates. \"We attack no more! Instead, go\r\ninto the huts and drive all the inferiors here! Compel them to bring\r\ntheir tools! Kill all that refuse!\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenants only dimly grasped the idea. \"What shall we do when\r\nwe get them here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do? Drive them against the invaders, of course!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a daring thought. None but a super bee could have conceived\r\nit. Off flew the lieutenants, with Supreme's inspired order humming\r\nafter them:\r\n\r\n\"Call out every bee! And drive every last one of the inferiors to\r\nthis spot!\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus it came about that, a minute later, the nine looked around\r\nto see the bees making off at top speed. Sorplee raised a cheer.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" he shouted, and the rest took it up. Neither admitted that\r\nhe was vastly relieved; it had been a little nerve-shaking to know\r\nthat a single thickness of leather had been all that stood, for an\r\nhour, between him and certain death. The buzzing, too, was\r\ndemoralizing.\r\n\r\n\"Now, to release the two men!\" reminded Deltos, and led the way to\r\nthe torture-place. They found Corrus and Dulnop exactly as the two\r\nwomen had left them six weeks before, except that their faces were\r\ndrawn with the agony of what they had endured. Below the surface of\r\nthe ground their bodies had shriveled and whitened with their daily\r\nimprisonment. Only their spirits remained unchanged; they, of all\r\nthe natives, had known what it was to feel superior.\r\n\r\nFor the last time they were dug out and helped to their feet. They\r\ncould not stand by themselves, much less run; but it is not likely\r\nthey would have fled. Somehow they knew that the strange\r\nhead-coverings had human faces behind them. And scarcely had they\r\nbeen freed before Sorplee, glancing about, gave an exclamation of\r\ndelight as he saw a group of natives running toward them.\r\n\r\n\"Just what we want!\" he exclaimed. \"They've seen the scrap, and\r\nrealize that we've won!\"\r\n\r\nLooking around, the nine could see the other groups likewise\r\nhurrying their way. All told, there were a couple of hundred of the\r\nvillagers, and all were armed with tools they knew how to use very\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\"Who shall do the honors?\" asked Sorplee. \"Wish Somat was here, to\r\nexplain for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't need him,\" reminded Deltos. \"All we've got to do is to show\r\nthese two fellows we dug up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was not until the first of the villagers was within twenty\r\nyards that the nine suspected anything. Then they heard the buzzing.\r\nLooking closer, they saw that it was--an attack!\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" cried Deltos, in swift panic. \"We are friends, not enemies!\"\r\n\r\nIt was like talking to the wind. The villagers had their choice of\r\ntwo fears: either fight the strangers with the magic flower, or--be\r\nstung to death. And no one can blame them for what they chose.\r\n\r\nThe nine had time enough to snatch knives or hatchets from their\r\nbelts, or clubs from the ground. Then, with wild cries of fear, the\r\nnatives closed in. They fought as only desperate people can fight,\r\ncaught between two fires. And they were two hundred to nine!\r\n\r\nIn half a minute the first of the invaders was down, his head\r\ncrushed by a mattock in the hands of a bee-tormented native. In a\r\nsingle minute all were gone but two; and a moment later, Deltos\r\nalone, because he had chanced to secure a long club, was alive of\r\nall that crew.\r\n\r\nFor a minute he kept them off by sheer strength. He swung the stick\r\nwith such vigor that he fairly cleared a circle for himself. The\r\nnatives paused, howling and shrieking, before the final rush.\r\n\r\nAn inspiration came to Deltos. He tore his cap from his head and his\r\nnet from his face.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he screamed, above the uproar. \"I am a man, like yourselves!\r\nDo not kill!\"\r\n\r\nNext second he froze in his tracks. The next he was writhing in the\r\ndeath agony, and the bees were supreme once more.\r\n\r\nSupreme herself had stung Deltos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nOVERLOOKED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the four on the earth, Smith was the first to make any comment.\r\nHe had considerable difficulty in throwing his thought to the\r\nothers; somehow he felt slightly dazed.\r\n\r\n\"This is--unbelievable!\" he said, and repeated it twice. \"To think\r\nthat those insects are still the masters!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish\"--Billie's voice shook somewhat--\"I wish almost that I had\r\nlet you warn Rolla. It might have helped--\" She broke off suddenly,\r\nintent upon something Supreme was hearing. \"Just listen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" a lieutenant was humming excitedly to the commandant. \"Back\r\nto the hives; give the order, Supreme!\"\r\n\r\nIt was done, and immediately the bees quit the throng of natives and\r\ntheir victims, rushing at top speed for their precious city. As they\r\nwent, Supreme demanded an explanation.\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer the lieutenant pointed her antennae straight ahead. At\r\nfirst Supreme could see nothing in the growing darkness; then she\r\nsaw that some of the sky was blacker than the rest. Next she caught\r\na faint glow.\r\n\r\n\"Supreme, the deadly flower has come to the hives!\"\r\n\r\nIt was true! In ten minutes the city was near enough for the\r\ncommandant to see it all very clearly. The fire had started on the\r\nwindward side, and already had swept through half the hives!\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" the order was snapped out. \"Into the remaining houses, and\r\nsave the young!\"\r\n\r\nShe herself led the horde. Straight into the face of the flames they\r\nflew, unquestioningly, unhesitantly. What was self, compared with\r\nthe Hive?\r\n\r\nNext moment, like a mammoth billow, the smoke rolled down upon them\r\nall. And thus it came about that the villagers, making their\r\ncautious way toward the bee city, shouted for joy and danced as they\r\nhad never danced before, when they saw what had happened.\r\n\r\nNot a bee was left alive. Every egg and larva was destroyed; every\r\nqueen was burned. And every last soldier and worker had lost her\r\nlife in the vain attempt at rescue. Suddenly one of the villagers,\r\nwho had been helping to carry Corrus and Dulnop to the spot, pointed\r\nout something on the other side of the fire! It was Rolla!\r\n\r\n\"Hail!\" she shouted, hysterical with happiness as she ran toward her\r\npeople. Cunora was close upon her heels. \"Hail to the flowing\r\nflower!\"\r\n\r\nShe held up a torch. Down fell the villagers to their knees. Holla\r\nstrode forward and found Corrus, even as Cunora located her Dulnop.\r\n\r\n\"Hail to the flowing flower!\" shouted Rolla again. \"And hail to the\r\nfree people of this world! A new day cometh for us all! The\r\nmasters--are no more!\"\r\n\r\nThe four on the earth looked at each other inquiringly. There was a\r\nheavy silence. The doctor stood it as long as he could, and then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"So far as I'm concerned, this ends our investigations.\" They stared\r\nat him uncomprehendingly; he went on: \"I don't see anything to be\r\ngained by this type of study. Here we've investigated the conditions\r\non two planets pretty thoroughly, and yet we can't agree upon what\r\nwe've learned!\r\n\r\n\"Van still thinks that the upper classes should rule, despite all\r\nthe misery we saw on Capellette! And Billie is still convinced that\r\nthe working classes, and no others, should govern! This, in the face\r\nof what we've just--seen! Sanus is absolute proof of what must\r\nhappen when one class tries to rule; conflict, bloodshed,\r\nmisery--little else! Besides\"--remembering something, and glancing\r\nat his watch--\"besides, it's time for dinner.\"\r\n\r\nBillie and Smith got to their feet, and in silence quit the room\r\nBillie and Van Emmon were still fumbling with their bracelets. The\r\ntwo young people rose from the chairs at the same time and started\r\nacross the room to put flip bracelets away. The wire which connected\r\nthem trailed in between and caught on the doctor's chair. It brought\r\nthe two of them up short.\r\n\r\nVan Emmon stared at the wire. He gave it a little tug. The chair did\r\nnot move. Billie gave an answering jerk, with similar lack of\r\nresults. Then they glanced swiftly at one another, and each stepped\r\nback enough to permit lifting the wire over the chair.\r\n\r\n\"In other words,\" Van Emmon stammered, with an effort to keep his\r\nvoice steady--\"in other words, Billie, we both had to give in a\r\nlittle, in order to get past that chair!\"\r\n\r\nThen he paused slightly, his heart pounding furiously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes Van.\" She dropped the bracelets. \"And--as for me--Van, I didn't\r\nreally want to see the bees win! I only pretended to--I wanted to\r\nmake you--think!\"\r\n\r\n\"Billie! I'll say 'cooperate' if you will!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cooperate!\"\r\n\r\nHe swept her into his arms, and held her so close that she could not\r\nsee what had rushed to his eyes. \"Speaking of cooperation,\" he\r\nremarked unsteadily, \"reminds me--it takes two to make a kiss!\"\r\n\r\nThey proceeded to experiment.",
