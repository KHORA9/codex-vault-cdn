These aims must be determined to a degree, first, by the\r\ncapabilities of the pupils, second, by their native interests, and, third,\r\nby the environment of the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe boy or girl of average ability upon admission to the secondary school\r\nis not a thinking individual. The training given up to this time, with but\r\nrare exceptions, has been in the forming of simple concepts. These concepts\r\nhave been reached didactically and empirically. Drill and memory work have\r\nbeen the pedagogic vehicles. Even the elementary science work given has\r\nresulted at the best in an interpretation of some of the common factors in\r\nthe pupil's environment, and a widening of the meaning of some of his\r\nconcepts. Therefore, the first science of the secondary school, elementary\r\nbiology, should be primarily the vehicle by which the child is taught to\r\nsolve problems and to think straight in so doing. No other subject is more\r\ncapable of logical development. No subject is more vital because of its\r\nrelation to the vital things in the life of the child. A series of\r\nexperiments and demonstrations, discussed and applied as definite concrete\r\nproblems which have arisen within the child's horizon, will develop power\r\nin thinking more surely than any other subject in the first year of the\r\nsecondary school.\r\n\r\nBut in our eagerness to develop the power of logical thinking we must not\r\nlose sight of the previous training of our pupil. Up to this time the\r\nmethod of induction, that handmaiden of logical thought, has been almost\r\nunknown. Concepts have been formed deductively by a series of comparisons.\r\nAll concepts have been handed down by the authority of the teacher or the\r\ntext; the inductive search for the unknown is as yet a closed book. It is\r\nunwise, then, to directly introduce the pupil to the method of induction\r\nwith a series of printed directions which, though definite in the mind of\r\nthe teacher because of his wider horizon, mean little or nothing as a\r\ndefinite problem to the pupil. The child must be brought to the\r\nappreciation of the problem through the deductive method, by a comparison\r\nof the future problem with some definite concrete experience within his own\r\nfield of vision. Then by the inductive experiment, still led by a series of\r\noral questions, he comes to the real end of the experiment, the conclusion,\r\nwith the true spirit of the investigator. The result is tested in the light\r\nof past experiment and a generalization is formed which means something to\r\nthe pupil.\r\n\r\nFor the above reason the laboratory problems, which naturally precede the\r\ntextbook work, should be separated from the subject matter of the text. A\r\ntextbook in biology should serve to verify the student's observations made\r\nin the laboratory, it should round out his concept or generalization by\r\nadding such material as he cannot readily observe and it should give the\r\nstudent directly such information as he cannot be expected to gain directly\r\nor indirectly through his laboratory experience. For these reasons the\r\nlaboratory manual has been separated from the text.\r\n\r\n     \"The laboratory method was such an emancipation from the\r\n     old-time bookish slavery of pre-laboratory days that we may\r\n     have been inclined to overdo it and to subject ourselves to\r\n     a new slavery. It should never be forgotten that the\r\n     laboratory is simply a means to the end; that the dominant\r\n     thing should be a consistent chain of ideas which the\r\n     laboratory may serve to elucidate. When, however, the\r\n     laboratory assumes the first place and other phases of the\r\n     course are made explanatory to it, we have taken, in my\r\n     mind, an attitude fundamentally wrong. The question is, not\r\n     what _types_ may be taken up in the laboratory to be fitted\r\n     into the general scheme afterwards, but what _ideas_ are\r\n     most worth while to be worked out and developed in the\r\n     laboratory, if that happens to be the best way of doing it,\r\n     or if not, some other way to be adopted with perfect\r\n     freedom. Too often our course of study of an animal or plant\r\n     takes the easiest rather than the most illuminating path.\r\n     What is easier, for instance, particularly with large\r\n     classes of restless pupils who apparently need to be kept in\r\n     a condition of uniform occupation, than to kill a supply of\r\n     animals, preferably as near alike as possible, and set the\r\n     pupils to work drawing the dead remains? This method is\r\n     usually supplemented by a series of questions concerning the\r\n     remains which are sure to keep the pupils busy a while\r\n     longer, perhaps until the bell strikes, and which usually\r\n     are so planned as to anticipate any ideas that might\r\n     naturally crop up in the pupil's mind during the drawing\r\n     exercise.\r\n\r\n     \"Such an abuse of the laboratory idea is all wrong and\r\n     should be avoided. The ideal laboratory ought to be a\r\n     retreat for rainy days; a substitute for out of doors; a\r\n     clearing house of ideas brought in from the outside. Any\r\n     course in biology which can be confined within four walls,\r\n     even if these walls be of a modern, well-equipped\r\n     laboratory, is in some measure a failure. Living things, to\r\n     be appreciated and correctly interpreted, must be seen and\r\n     studied in the open where they will be encountered\r\n     throughout life. _The place where an animal or plant is\r\n     found is just as important a characteristic as its shape or\r\n     function._ Impossible field excursions with large classes\r\n     within school hours, which only bring confusion to\r\n     _inflexible_ school programs, are not necessary to\r\n     accomplish this result. Properly administered, it is without\r\n     doubt one of our most efficient devices for developing\r\n     biological ideas, but the laboratory should be kept in its\r\n     proper relation to the other means at our disposal and never\r\n     be allowed to degenerate either into a place for vacuous\r\n     drawing exercises or a biological morgue where dead remains\r\n     are viewed.\"--_Dr. H. E. Walter._\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the pupil the number of technical and scientific terms has\r\nbeen reduced to a minimum. The language has been made as simple as possible\r\nand the problems made to hinge upon material already known, by hearsay at\r\nleast, to the pupil. So far as consistent with a well-rounded course in the\r\nessentials of biological science, the interests of the children have been\r\nkept in the foreground. In a recent questionnaire sent out by the author\r\nand answered by over three thousand children studying biology in the\r\nsecondary schools of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York\r\nby far the greatest number gave as the most interesting topics those\r\nrelating to the care and functions of the human body and the control and\r\nbetterment of the environment. As would be expected, boys have different\r\nbiological interests from girls, and children in rural schools wish to\r\nstudy different topics from those in congested districts in large\r\ncommunities. The time has come when we must frankly recognize these\r\ninterests and adapt the content of our courses in biology to interpret the\r\n_immediate_ world of the pupil.\r\n\r\nWith this end in view the following pages have been written. This book\r\nshows boys and girls living in an urban community how they may best live\r\nwithin their own environment and how they may cooperate with the civic\r\nauthorities for the betterment of their environment. A logical course is\r\nbuilt up around the topics which appeal to the average normal boy or girl,\r\ntopics given in a logical sequence so as to work out the solution of\r\nproblems bearing on the ultimate problem of the entire course, that of\r\npreparation for citizenship in the largest sense.\r\n\r\nSeasonal use of materials has been kept in mind in outlining this course.\r\nField trips, when properly organized and later used as a basis for\r\ndiscussion in the classroom, make a firm foundation on which to build the\r\nsuperstructure of a course in biology. The normal environment, its relation\r\nto the artificial environment of the city, the relations of mutual give and\r\ntake existing between plants and animals, are better shown by means of\r\nfield trips than in any other way. Field and museum trips are enjoyed by\r\nthe pupils as well. These result in interest and in better work. The course\r\nis worked up around certain great biological principles; hence insects may\r\nbe studied when abundant in the fall in connection with their relations to\r\ngreen plants and especially in their relation to flowers. In the winter\r\nmonths material available for the laboratory is used. Saprophytic and\r\nparasitic organisms, wild plants in the household, are studied in their\r\nrelations to mankind, both as destroyers of food, property and life and as\r\nman's invaluable friends. The economic phase of biology may well be taken\r\nup during the winter months, thus gaining variety in subject matter and in\r\nmethod of treatment. The apparent emphasis placed upon economic material in\r\nthe following pages is not real. It has been found that material so given\r\nmakes for variety, as it may be assigned as a topical reading lesson or\r\nsimply used as reference when needed. Cyclic work in the study of life\r\nphenomena and of the needs of organisms for oxygen, food, and reproduction\r\nculminates, as it rightly should, in the study of life-processes of man and\r\nman's relation to his environment.\r\n\r\nIn a course in biology the difficulty comes not so much in knowing what to\r\nteach as in knowing what _not_ to teach. The author believes that he has\r\nmade a selection of the topics most vital in a well-rounded course in\r\nelementary biology directed toward civic betterment. The physiological\r\nfunctions of plants and animals, the hygiene of the individual within the\r\ncommunity, conservation and the betterment of existing plant and animal\r\nproducts, the big underlying biological concepts on which society is built,\r\nhave all been used to the end that the pupil will become a better, stronger\r\nand more unselfish citizen. The \"spiral\" or cyclic method of treatment has\r\nbeen used throughout, the purpose being to ultimately build up a number of\r\nwell-rounded concepts by constant repetition but with constantly varied\r\nviewpoint.\r\n\r\nThe sincere thanks of the author is extended to all who have helped make\r\nthis book possible, and especially to the members of the Department of\r\nBiology in the De Witt Clinton High School. Most of the men there have\r\ndirectly or indirectly contributed their time and ideas to help make this\r\nbook worth more to teachers and pupils. The following have read the\r\nmanuscript in its entirety and have offered much valuable constructive\r\ncriticism: Dr. Herbert E. Walter, Professor of Zoology in Brown University;\r\nMiss Elsie Kupfer, Head of the Department of Biology in Wadleigh High\r\nSchool; George C. Wood, of the Department of Biology in the Boys' High\r\nSchool, Brooklyn; Edgar A. Bedford, Head of Department of Biology in the\r\nStuyvesant High School; George E. Hewitt, George T. Hastings, John D.\r\nMcCarthy, and Frank M. Wheat, all of the Department of Biology in the De\r\nWitt Clinton High School.\r\n\r\nThanks are due, also, to Professor E. B. Wilson, Professor G. N. Calkins,\r\nMr. William C. Barbour, Dr. John A. Sampson, W. C. Stevens, and C. W.\r\nBeebe, Dr. Alvin Davison, and Dr. Frank Overton; to the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture; the New York Aquarium; the Charity Organization\r\nSociety; and the American Museum of Natural History, for permission to copy\r\nand use certain photographs and cuts which have been found useful in\r\nteaching. Dr. Charles H. Morse and Dr. Lucius J. Mason, of the De Witt\r\nClinton High School, prepared the hygiene outline in the appendix. Frank M.\r\nWheat and my former pupil, John W. Teitz, now a teacher in the school, made\r\nmany of the line drawings and took several of the photographs of\r\nexperiments prepared for this book. To them especially I wish to express my\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each of the following chapters is a list of books which have\r\nproved their use either as reference reading for students or as aids to the\r\nteacher. Most of the books mentioned are within the means of the small\r\nschool. Two sets are expensive: one, _The Natural History of Plants_, by\r\nKerner, translated by Oliver, published by Henry Holt and Company, in two\r\nvolumes, at $11; the other, _Plant Geography upon a Physiological Basis_,\r\nby Schimper, published by the Clarendon Press, $12; but both works are\r\ninvaluable for reference.\r\n\r\nFor a general introduction to physiological biology, Parker, _Elementary\r\nBiology_, The Macmillan Company; Sedgwick and Wilson, _General Biology_,\r\nHenry Holt and Company; Verworn, _General Physiology_, The Macmillan\r\nCompany; and Needham, _General Biology_, Comstock Publishing Company, are\r\nmost useful and inspiring books.\r\n\r\nTwo books stand out from the pedagogical standpoint as by far the most\r\nhelpful of their kind on the market. No teacher of botany or zoology can\r\nafford to be without them. They are: Lloyd and Bigelow, _The Teaching of\r\nBiology_, Longmans, Green, and Company, and C. F. Hodge, _Nature Study and\r\nLife_, Ginn and Company. Other books of value from the teacher's standpoint\r\nare: Ganong, _The Teaching Botanist_, The Macmillan Company; L. H. Bailey,\r\n_The Nature Study Idea_, Doubleday, Page, and Company; and McMurry's _How\r\nto Study_, Houghton Mifflin Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                     PAGE\r\n\r\n         FOREWORD TO TEACHERS                                    7\r\n\r\n      I.

THE GENERAL PROBLEM--SOME REASONS FOR THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Biology?--_Biology is the study of living beings, both plant and\r\nanimal._ Inasmuch as man is an animal, the study of biology includes the\r\nstudy of man in his relations to the plants and the animals which surround\r\nhim. Most important of all is that branch of biology which treats of the\r\nmechanism we call the human body,--of its parts and their uses, and its\r\nrepair. This subject we call _human physiology_.\r\n\r\nWhy study Biology?--Although biology is a very modern science, it has found\r\nits way into most high schools; and an increasingly large number of girls\r\nand boys are yearly engaged in its study. These questions might well be\r\nasked by any of the students: Why do I take up the study of biology? Of\r\nwhat practical value is it to me? Besides the discipline it gives me, is\r\nthere anything that I can take away which will help me in my future life?\r\n\r\nHuman Physiology.--The answer to this question is plain. If the study of\r\nbiology will give us a better understanding of our own bodies and their\r\ncare, then it certainly is of use to us. That phase of biology known as\r\n_physiology_ deals with the uses of the parts of a plant or animal; human\r\nphysiology and hygiene deal with the uses and care of the parts of the\r\nhuman animal. The prevention of sickness is due in a large part to the\r\nstudy of hygiene. It is estimated that over twenty-five per cent of the\r\ndeaths that occur yearly in this country could be averted if _all_ people\r\nlived in a hygienic manner. In its application to the lives of each of us,\r\nas a member of our family, as a member of the school we attend, and as a\r\nfuture citizen, a knowledge of hygiene is of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\nRelations of Plants to Animals.--But there are other reasons why an\r\neducated person should know something about biology. We do not always\r\nrealize that if it were not for the green plants, there would be no animals\r\non the earth. Green plants furnish food to animals. Even the meat-eating\r\nanimals feed upon those that feed upon plants. How the plants manufacture\r\nthis food and the relation they bear to animals will be discussed in later\r\nchapters. Plants furnish man with the greater part of his food in the form\r\nof grains and cereals, fruits and nuts, edible roots and leaves; they\r\nprovide his domesticated animals with food; they give him timber for his\r\nhouses and wood and coal for his fires; they provide him with pulp wood,\r\nfrom which he makes his paper, and oak galls, from which he may make ink.\r\nMuch of man's clothing and the thread with which it is sewed together come\r\nfrom fiber-producing plants. Most medicines, beverages, flavoring extracts,\r\nand spices are plant products, while plants are made use of in hundreds of\r\nways in the useful arts and trades, producing varnishes, dyestuffs, rubber,\r\nand other products.\r\n\r\nBacteria in their Relation to Man.--In still another way, certain plants\r\nvitally affect mankind. Tiny plants, called _bacteria_, so small that\r\nmillions can exist in a single drop of fluid, exist almost everywhere about\r\nus,--in water, soil, food, and the air. They play a tremendous part in\r\nshaping the destiny of man on the earth. They help him in that they act as\r\nscavengers, causing things to decay; thus they remove the dead bodies of\r\nplants and animals from the surface of the earth, and turn this material\r\nback to the ground; they assist the tanner; they help make cheese and\r\nbutter; they improve the soil for crop growing; so the farmer cannot do\r\nwithout them. But they likewise sometimes spoil our meat and fish, and our\r\nvegetables and fruits; they sour our milk, and may make our canned goods\r\nspoil. Worst of all, they cause diseases, among others tuberculosis, a\r\ndisease so harmful as to be called the \"white plague.\" Fully one half of\r\nall yearly deaths are caused by these plants. So important are the bacteria\r\nthat a sub-division of biology, called _bacteriology_, has been named\r\nafter them, and hundreds of scientists are devoting their lives to the\r\nstudy of bacteria and their control. The greatest of all bacteriologists,\r\nLouis Pasteur, once said, \"It is within the power of man to cause all\r\nparasitic diseases (diseases mostly caused by bacteria) to disappear from\r\nthe world.\" His prophecy is gradually being fulfilled, and it may be the\r\nlot of some boys or girls who read this book to do their share in helping\r\nto bring this condition of affairs about.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Animals to Man.--Animals also play an important part in the\r\nworld in causing and carrying disease. Animals that cause disease are\r\nusually tiny, and live in other animals as _parasites_; that is, they get\r\ntheir living from their hosts on which they feed. Among the diseases caused\r\nby parasitic animals are malaria, yellow fever, the sleeping sickness, and\r\nthe hookworm disease. Animals also _carry_ disease, especially the flies\r\nand mosquitoes; rats and other animals are also well known as spreaders of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nFrom a money standpoint, animals called insects do much harm. It is\r\nestimated that in this country alone they are annually responsible for\r\n$800,000,000 worth of damage by eating crops, forest trees, stored food,\r\nand other material wealth.\r\n\r\nThe Uses of Animals to Man.--We all know the uses man has made of the\r\ndomesticated animals for food and as beasts of burden. But many other uses\r\nare found for animal products, and materials made from animals. Wool, furs,\r\nleather, hides, feathers, and silk are examples. The arts make use of\r\nivory, tortoise shell, corals, and mother-of-pearl; from animals come\r\nperfumes and oils, glue, lard, and butter; animals produce honey, wax,\r\nmilk, eggs, and various other commodities.\r\n\r\nThe Conservation of our Natural Resources.--Still another reason why we\r\nshould study biology is that we may work understandingly for the\r\nconservation of our natural resources, especially of our forests. The\r\nforest, aside from its beauty and its health-giving properties, holds\r\nwater in the earth. It keeps the water from drying out of the earth on hot\r\ndays and from running off on rainy days. Thus a more even supply of water\r\nis given to our rivers, and thus freshets are prevented. Countries that\r\nhave been deforested, such as China, Italy, and parts of France, are now\r\nsubject to floods, and are in many places barren. On the forests depend our\r\nsupply of timber, our future water power, and the future commercial\r\nimportance of cities which, like New York, are located at the mouths of our\r\nnavigable rivers.\r\n\r\nPlants and Animals mutually Helpful.--Most plants and animals stand in an\r\nattitude of mutual helpfulness to one another, plants providing food and\r\nshelter for animals; animals giving off waste materials useful to plants in\r\nthe making of food. We also learn that plants and animals need the same\r\nconditions in their surroundings in order to live: water, air, food, a\r\nfavorable temperature, and usually light. The life processes of both plants\r\nand animals are essentially the same, and the living matter of a tree is as\r\nmuch alive as is the living matter in a fish, a dog, or a man.\r\n\r\nBiology in its Relation to Society.--Again, the study of biology should be\r\npart of the education of every boy and girl, because society itself is\r\nfounded upon the principles which biology teaches. Plants and animals are\r\nliving things, taking what they can from their surroundings; they enter\r\ninto competition with one another, and those which are the best fitted for\r\nlife outstrip the others. Animals and plants tend to vary each from its\r\nnearest relative in all details of structure. The strong may thus hand down\r\nto their offspring the characteristics which make them the winners. Health\r\nand strength of body and mind are factors which tell in winning.\r\n\r\nMan has made use of this message of nature, and has developed improved\r\nbreeds of horses, cattle, and other domestic animals. Plant breeders have\r\nlikewise selected the plants or seeds that have varied toward better\r\nplants, and thus have stocked the earth with hardier and more fruitful\r\ndomesticated plants. Man's dominion over the living things of the earth is\r\ntremendous. This is due to his understanding the principles which underlie\r\nthe science of biology.\r\n\r\nFinally the study of biology ought to make us better men and women by\r\nteaching us that unselfishness exists in the natural world as well as among\r\nthe highest members of society. Animals, lowly and complex, sacrifice their\r\ncomfort and their very lives for their young. In the insect communities the\r\nwelfare of the individual is given up for the best interests of the\r\ncommunity. The law of mutual give and take, of sacrifice for the common\r\ngood, is seen everywhere. This should teach us, as we come to take our\r\nplaces in society, to be willing to give up our individual pleasure or\r\nselfish gain for the good of the community in which we live. Thus the\r\napplication of biological principles will benefit society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE ENVIRONMENT OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS\r\n\r\n_Problem.--To discover some of the factors of the environment of plants and\r\n           animals._\r\n         _(a) Environment of a plant._\r\n         _(b) Environment of an animal._\r\n         _(c) Home environment of a girl or boy._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Laboratory demonstrations._--Factors of the environment of\r\n       a living plant or animal in the vivarium.\r\n     _Home exercise._--The study of the factors making up my own\r\n       environment and how I can aid in their control.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment.--Each one of us, no matter where he lives, comes in contact\r\nwith certain surroundings. Air is everywhere around us; light is necessary\r\nto us, so much so that we use artificial light at night. The city street,\r\nwith its dirty and hard paving stones, has come to take the place of the\r\nsoil of the village or farm. Water and food are a necessary part of our\r\nsurroundings. Our clothing, useful to maintain a certain temperature, must\r\nalso be included. All these things--air, light, heat, water, food--together\r\nmake up our _environment_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An unfavorable city environment.]\r\n\r\nAll other animals, and all plants as well, are surrounded by and use\r\npractically the same things from their environment as we do. The potted\r\nplant in the window, the goldfish in the aquarium, your pet dog at home,\r\nall use, as we will later prove, the factors of their environment in the\r\nsame manner. Air, water, light, a certain amount of heat, soil to live in\r\nor on, and food form parts of the surroundings of _every_ living thing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An experiment that shows the air contains about four fifths\r\nnitrogen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apparatus for separating water by means of an electric\r\ncurrent into the two elements, hydrogen and oxygen.]\r\n\r\nThe Same Elements found in Plants and Animals as in their Environment.--It\r\nhas been found by chemists that the plants and animals as well as their\r\nenvironment may be reduced to about eighty very simple substances known as\r\n_chemical elements_. For example, the air is made up largely of two\r\nelements, _oxygen_ and _nitrogen_. Water, by means of an electric current,\r\nmay be broken up into two elements, _oxygen_ and _hydrogen_. The elements\r\nin water are combined to make a _chemical compound_. The oxygen and\r\nnitrogen of the air are not so united, but exist as separate gases. If we\r\nwere to study the chemistry of the bodies of plants and animals and of\r\ntheir foods, we would find them to be made up of certain chemical elements\r\ncombined in various complex compounds. These elements are principally\r\n_carbon_, _hydrogen_, _oxygen_, _nitrogen_, and perhaps a dozen others in\r\nvery minute proportions. But the same elements present in the living things\r\nmight also be found in the environment, for example, water, food, the air,\r\nand the soil. It is logical to believe that living things use the chemical\r\nelements in their surroundings and in some wonderful manner build up their\r\nown bodies from the materials found in their environment. How this is done\r\nwe will learn in later chapters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart to show the percentage of chemical elements in the\r\nhuman body.]\r\n\r\nWhat Plants and Animals take from their Environment. Air.--It is a\r\nself-evident fact that animals need air. Even those living in the water use\r\nthe air dissolved in the water. A fish placed in an air-tight jar will soon\r\ndie. It will be proven later that plants also need air in order to live.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The effect of water upon the growth of trees. These trees\r\nwere all planted at the same time in soil that is sandy and uniform. They\r\nare watered by a small stream which runs from left to right in the picture.\r\nMost of the water soaks into the ground before reaching the last trees.]\r\n\r\nWater.--We all know that water must form part of the environment of plants\r\nand animals. It is a matter of common knowledge that pets need water to\r\ndrink; so do other animals. Every one knows we must water a potted plant if\r\nwe expect it to grow. Water is of so much importance to man that from the\r\ntime of the Caesars until now he has spent enormous sums of money to bring\r\npure water to his cities. The United States government is spending millions\r\nof dollars at the present time to bring by irrigation the water needed to\r\nsupport life in the western desert lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The effect of light upon a growing plant.]\r\n\r\nLight as Condition of the Environment.--Light is another important factor\r\nof the environment. A study of the leaves on any green plant growing near a\r\nwindow will convince one that such plants grow toward the light. All green\r\nplants are thus influenced by the sun. Other plants which are not green\r\nseem either indifferent or are negatively influenced (move away from) the\r\nsource of light. Animals may or may not be attracted by light. A moth, for\r\nexample, will fly toward a flame, an earthworm will move away from light.\r\nSome animals prefer a moderate or weak intensity of light and live in shady\r\nforests or jungles, prowling about at night. Others seem to need much and\r\nstrong light. And man himself enjoys only moderate intensity of light and\r\nheat. Look at the shady side of a city street on any hot day to prove this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nHeat.--Animals and plants are both affected by heat or the absence of it.\r\nIn cold weather green plants either die or their life activities are\r\ntemporarily suspended,--the plant becomes _dormant_. Likewise small\r\nanimals, such as insects, may be killed by cold or they may _hibernate_\r\nunder stones or boards. Their life activities are stilled until the coming\r\nof warm weather. Bears and other large animals go to sleep during the\r\nwinter and awake thin and active at the approach of warm weather. Animals\r\nor plants used to certain temperatures are killed if removed from those\r\ntemperatures. Even man, the most adaptable of all animals, cannot stand\r\ngreat changes without discomfort and sometimes death. He heats his houses\r\nin winter and cools them in summer so as to have the amount of heat most\r\nacceptable to him, _i.e._ about 70 deg. Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vegetation in Northern Russia. The trees in this picture are\r\nnearly one hundred years old. They live under conditions of extreme cold\r\nmost of the year.]\r\n\r\nThe Environment determines the Kind of Animals and Plants within It.--In\r\nour study of geography we learned that certain luxuriant growths of trees\r\nand climbing plants were characteristic of the tropics with its moist, warm\r\nclimate. No one would expect to find living there the hardy stunted plants\r\nof the arctic region. Nor would we expect to find the same kinds of animal\r\nlife in warm regions as in cold. The surroundings determine the kind of\r\nliving things there. Plants or animals _fitted to live_ in a given locality\r\nwill probably be found there if they have had an opportunity to reach that\r\nlocality. If, for example, temperate forms of life were introduced by man\r\ninto the tropics, they would either die or they would gradually change so\r\nas to become fitted to live in their new environment. Sheep with long wool\r\nfitted to live in England, when removed to Cuba, where conditions of\r\ngreater heat exist, soon died because they were not fitted or _adapted_ to\r\nlive in their changed environment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plant life in a moist tropical forest. Notice the air plants\r\nto the left and the resurrection ferns on the tree trunk.]\r\n\r\nAdaptations.--Plants and animals are not only fitted to live under certain\r\nconditions, but each part of the body may be fitted to do certain work. I\r\nnotice that as I write these words the fingers of my right hand grasp the\r\npen firmly and the hand and arm execute some very complicated movements.\r\nThis they are able to do because of the free movement given through the\r\narrangement of the delicate bones of the wrist and fingers, their\r\nattachment to the bones of the arm, a wonderful complex of muscles which\r\nmove the bones, and a directing nervous system which plans the work.\r\nBecause of the peculiar fitness in the structure of the hand for this work\r\nwe say it is adapted to its function of grasping objects. Each part of a\r\nplant or animal is usually fitted for some particular work. The root of a\r\ngreen plant, for example, is fitted to take in water by having tiny\r\nabsorbing organs growing from it, the stems have pipes or tubes to convey\r\nliquids up and down and are strong enough to support the leafy part of the\r\nplant. Each part of a plant does work, and is fitted, by means of certain\r\nstructures, to do that work. It is because of these adaptations that living\r\nthings are able to do their work within their particular environment.\r\n\r\nPlants and Animals and their Natural Environment.--Those of us who have\r\ntried to keep potted plants in the schoolroom know how difficult it is to\r\nkeep them healthy. Dust, foreign gases in the air, lack of moisture, and\r\nother causes make the artificial environment in which they are placed\r\nunsuitable for them.\r\n\r\nA goldfish placed in a small glass jar with no food or no green water\r\nplants soon seeks the surface of the water, and if the water is not changed\r\nfrequently so as to supply air the fish will die. Again the artificial\r\nenvironment lacks something that the fish needs. Each plant and animal is\r\nlimited to a certain environment because of certain individual needs which\r\nmake the surroundings fit for it to live in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A natural barrier on a stream. No trout would be found above\r\nthis fall. Why not?]\r\n\r\nChanges in Environment.--Most plants and animals do not change their\r\nenvironment. Trees, green plants of all kinds, and some animals remain\r\nfixed in one spot practically all their lives. Certain tiny plants and most\r\nanimals move from place to place, either in air, water, on the earth or in\r\nthe earth, but they maintain relatively the same conditions in environment.\r\nBirds are perhaps the most striking exception, for some may fly thousands\r\nof miles from their summer homes to winter in the south. Other animals,\r\ntoo, migrate from place to place, but not usually where there are great\r\nchanges in the surroundings. A high mountain chain with intense cold at the\r\nupper altitudes would be a barrier over which, for example, a bear, a deer,\r\nor a snail could not travel. Fish like trout will migrate up a stream until\r\nthey come to a fall too high for them to jump. There they must stop because\r\ntheir environment limits them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A new apartment house, with out-of-door sleeping porch.]\r\n\r\nMan in his Environment.--Man, while he is like other animals in requiring\r\nheat, light, water, and food, differs from them in that he has come to live\r\nin a more or less artificial environment. Men who lived on the earth\r\nthousands of year ago did not wear clothes or have elaborate homes of wood\r\nor brick or stone. They did not use fire, nor did they eat cooked foods. In\r\nshort, by slow degrees, civilized man has come to live in a changed\r\nenvironment from that of other animals. The living together of men in\r\ncommunities has caused certain needs to develop. Many things can be\r\nsupplied in common, as water, milk, foods. Wastes of all kinds have to be\r\ndisposed of in a town or city. Houses have come to be placed close\r\ntogether, or piled on top of each other, as in the modern apartment. Fields\r\nand trees, all outdoor life, has practically disappeared. Man has come to\r\nlive in an artificial environment.\r\n\r\nCare and Improvement of One's Environment.--Man can modify or change his\r\nsurroundings by making this artificial environment favorable to live in. He\r\nmay heat his dwellings in winter and cool them in summer so as to maintain\r\na moderate and nearly constant temperature. He may see that his dwellings\r\nhave windows so as to let light and air pass in and out. He may have light\r\nat night and shade by day from intense light. He may have a system of pure\r\nwater supply and may see that drains or sewers carry away his wastes. He\r\nmay see to it that people ill with \"catching\" or _infectious_ diseases are\r\nisolated or _quarantined_ from others. This care of the artificial\r\nenvironment is known as _sanitation_, while the care of the _individual_\r\nfor himself within the environment is known as _hygiene_. It will be the\r\nchief end of this book to show girls and boys how they may become good\r\ncitizens through the proper control of personal hygiene and sanitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

THE INTERRELATIONS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS\r\n\r\n_Problem.--To discover the general interrelations of green plants and\r\n           animals._\r\n         _(a) Plants as homes for insects._\r\n         _(b) Plants as food for insects._\r\n         _(c) Insects as pollinating agents._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _A field trip_:--Object: to collect common insects and study\r\n       their general characteristics; to study the food and shelter\r\n       relation of plant and insects.

It is very artificial at best. To understand better the\r\n_normal environment_ of plants or animals we should go into the country.\r\nFailing in this, an overgrown city lot or a park will give us much more\r\nclosely the environment as it touches some animals lower than man. We must\r\nthen remember that in learning something of the natural environment of\r\nother living creatures we may better understand our own environment and our\r\nrelation to it.\r\n\r\nOn any bright warm day in the fall we will find insects swarming everywhere\r\nin any vacant lot or the less cultivated parts of a city park.\r\nGrasshoppers, butterflies alighting now and then on the flowers, brightly\r\nmarked hornets, bees busily working over the purple asters or golden rod,\r\nand many other forms hidden away on the leaves or stems of plants may be\r\nseen. If we were to select for observation some partially decayed tree, we\r\nwould find it also inhabited. Beetles would be found boring through its\r\nbark and wood, while caterpillars (the young stages of butterflies or\r\nmoths) are feeding on its leaves or building homes in its branches.\r\nEverywhere above, on, and under ground may be noticed small forms of life,\r\nmany of them insects. Let us first see how we would go to work to identify\r\nsome of the common forms we would be likely to find on plants. Then a\r\nlittle later we will find out what they are doing on these plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An insect viewed from the side. Notice the head, thorax, and\r\nabdomen. What other characters do you find?]\r\n\r\nHow to tell an Insect.--A bee is a good example of the group of animals we\r\ncall _insects_. If we examine its body carefully, we notice that it has\r\nthree regions, a front part or _head_, a middle part called the _thorax_,\r\nand a hind portion, jointed and hairy, the _abdomen_. We cannot escape\r\nnoting the fact that this insect has wings with which it flies and that it\r\nalso has legs. The three pairs of legs, which are jointed and provided with\r\ntiny hooks at the end, are attached to the thorax. Two pairs of delicate\r\nwings are attached to the upper or _dorsal_ side of the thorax. The thorax\r\nand indeed the entire body, is covered with a hard shell of material\r\nsimilar to a cow's horn, there being no skeleton inside for the attachment\r\nof muscles. If we carefully watch the abdomen of a living bee, we notice it\r\nmove up and down quite regularly. The animal is breathing through tiny\r\nbreathing holes called _spiracles_, placed along the side of the thorax and\r\nabdomen. Bees also have compound eyes. Wings are not found on all insects,\r\nbut all the other characters just given are marks of the great group of\r\nanimals we call _insects_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of the compound eye of an insect (highly magnified).]\r\n\r\nForms to be looked for on a Field Trip.--Inasmuch as there are over 360,000\r\ndifferent species or kinds of insects, it is evident that it would be a\r\nhopeless task for us even to think of recognizing all of them. But we can\r\nlearn to recognize a few examples of the common forms that might be met on\r\na field trip. In the fields, on grass, or on flowering plants we may count\r\non finding members from six groups or _orders_ of insects. These may be\r\nknown by the following characters.\r\n\r\nThe order _Hymenoptera_ (membrane wing) to which the bees, wasps, and ants\r\nbelong is the only insect group the members of which are provided with true\r\nstings. This sting is placed in a sheath at the extreme hind end of the\r\nabdomen. Other characteristics, which show them to be insects, have been\r\ngiven above.\r\n\r\nButterflies or moths will be found hovering over flowers. They belong to\r\nthe order _Lepidoptera_ (scale wings). This name is given to them because\r\ntheir wings are covered with tiny scales, which fit into little sockets on\r\nthe wing much as shingles are placed on a roof. The dust which comes off on\r\nthe fingers when one catches a butterfly is composed of these scales. The\r\nwings are always large and usually brightly colored, the legs small, and\r\none pair is often inconspicuous. These insects may be seen to take liquid\r\nfood through a long tubelike organ, called the _proboscis_, which they keep\r\nrolled up under the head when not in use. The young of the butterfly or\r\nmoth are known as _caterpillars_ and feed on plants by means of a pair of\r\nhard jaws.\r\n\r\nGrasshoppers, found almost everywhere, and crickets, black grasshopper-like\r\ninsects often found under stones, belong to the order _Orthoptera_\r\n(straight wings). Members of this group may usually be distinguished by\r\ntheir strong, jumping hind legs, by their chewing or biting mouth parts,\r\nand by the fact that the hind wings are folded up under the somewhat\r\nstiffer front wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forms of life to be met on a field trip. _A_, The red-legged\r\nlocust, one of the _Orthoptera_; _o_, the egg-layer, about natural size.\r\n_B_, the honey bee, one of the _Hymenoptera_, about natural size. _C_, a\r\nbug, one of the _Hemiptera_, about natural size. _D_, a butterfly, an\r\nexample of the _Lepidoptera_, slightly reduced. _E_, a house fly, an\r\nexample of the _Diptera_, about twice natural size. _F_, an orb-weaving\r\nspider, about half natural size. (This is not an insect, note the number of\r\nlegs.) _G_, a beetle, slightly reduced, one of the _Coleoptera_.]\r\n\r\nAnother group of insects sometimes found on flowers in the fall are flies.\r\nThey belong to the order _Diptera_ (two wings). These insects are usually\r\nrather small and have a single pair of gauzy wings. Flies are of much\r\nimportance to man because certain of their number are disease carriers.\r\n\r\nBugs, members of the order _Hemiptera_ (half wings), have a jointed\r\nproboscis which points backward between the front legs. They are usually\r\nsmall and may or may not have wings.\r\n\r\nThe beetles or _Coleoptera_ (sheath wings), often mistaken for bugs by the\r\nuneducated, have the first pair of hardened wings meeting in a straight\r\nline in the middle of the back, the second pair of wings being covered by\r\nthem. Beetles are frequently found on goldenrod blossoms in the fall.\r\n\r\nOther forms of life, especially _spiders_, which have four pairs of walking\r\nlegs, _centipedes_ and _millepedes_, both of which are wormlike and have\r\nmany pairs of legs, may be found.\r\n\r\nTry to discover members of the six different orders named above. Collect\r\nspecimens and bring them to the laboratory for identification.\r\n\r\nWhy do Insects live on Plants?--We have found insect life abundant on\r\nliving green plants, some visiting flowers, others hidden away on the\r\nstalks or leaves of the plants. Let us next try to find out _why_ insects\r\nlive among and upon flowering green plants.\r\n\r\nThe Life History of the Milkweed Butterfly.--If it is possible to find on\r\nour trip some growing milkweed, we are quite likely to find hovering near,\r\na golden brown and black butterfly, the monarch or milkweed butterfly\r\n(_Anosia plexippus_). Its body, as in all insects, is composed of three\r\nregions. The monarch frequents the milkweed in order to lay eggs there.\r\nThis she may be found doing at almost any time from June until September.\r\n\r\nEgg and Larva.--The eggs, tiny hat-shaped dots a twentieth of an inch in\r\nlength, are fastened singly to the underside of milkweed leaves. Some\r\nwonderful instinct leads the animal to deposit the eggs on the milkweed,\r\nfor the young feed upon no other plant. The eggs hatch out in four or five\r\ndays into rapid-growing wormlike caterpillars, each of which will shed its\r\nskin several times before it becomes full size. These caterpillars possess,\r\nin addition to the three pairs of true legs, additional pairs of _prolegs_\r\nor caterpillar legs. The animal at this stage is known as a _larva_.\r\n\r\nFormation of Pupa.--After a life of a few weeks at most, the caterpillar\r\nstops eating and begins to spin a tiny mat of silk upon a leaf or stem. It\r\nattaches itself to this web by the last pair of prolegs, and there hangs in\r\nthe dormant stage known as the _chrysalis_ or _pupa_. This is a resting\r\nstage during which the body changes from a caterpillar to a butterfly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monarch butterfly: adults, larvae, and pupa on their food\r\nplant, the milkweed. (From a photograph loaned by the American Museum of\r\nNatural History.)]\r\n\r\nThe Adult.--After a week or more of inactivity in the pupa state, the outer\r\nskin is split along the back, and the adult butterfly emerges. At first the\r\nwings are soft and much smaller than in the adult. Within fifteen minutes\r\nto half an hour after the butterfly emerges, however, the wings are\r\nfull-sized, having been pumped full of blood and air, and the little insect\r\nis ready after her wedding flight to follow her instinct to deposit her\r\neggs on a milkweed plant.\r\n\r\nPlants furnish Insects with Food.--Food is the most important factor of any\r\nanimal's environment. The insects which we have seen on our field trip feed\r\non the green plants among which they live. Each insect has its own\r\nparticular favorite food plant or plants, and in many cases the eggs of the\r\ninsect are laid on the food plant so that the young may have food close at\r\nhand. Some insects prefer the rotted wood of trees. An American zoologist,\r\nPackard, has estimated that over 450 kinds of insects live upon oak trees\r\nalone. Everywhere animals are engaged in taking their nourishment from\r\nplants, and millions of dollars of damage is done every year to gardens,\r\nfruits, and cereal crops by insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Damage done by insects. These trees have been killed by\r\nboring insects.]\r\n\r\nAll Animals depend on Green Plants.--But insects in their turn are the food\r\nof birds; cats and dogs may kill birds; lions or tigers live on still\r\nlarger defenseless animals as deer or cattle. And finally comes man, who\r\neats the bodies of both plants and animals. But if we reduce this search\r\nafter food to its final limit, we see that green plants provide _all_ the\r\nfood for animals. For the lion or tiger eats the deer which feeds upon\r\ngrass or green shoots of young trees, or the cat eats the bird that lives\r\non weed seeds. Green plants supply the food of the world. Later by\r\nexperiment we will prove this.\r\n\r\nHomes and Shelter.--After a field trip no one can escape the knowledge that\r\nplants often give animals a home. The grass shelters millions of\r\ngrasshoppers and countless hordes of other small insects which can be\r\nobtained by sweeping through the grass with an insect net. Some insects\r\nbuild their homes in the trees or bushes on which they feed, while others\r\ntunnel through the wood, making homes there. Spiders build webs on plants,\r\noften using the leaves for shelter. Birds nest in trees, and many other\r\nwild animals use the forest as their home. Man has come to use all kinds of\r\nplant products to aid him in making his home, wood and various fibers being\r\nthe most important of these.\r\n\r\nWhat do Animals do for Plants?--So far it has seemed that green plants\r\nbenefit animals and receive nothing in return. We will later see that\r\nplants and animals _together_ form a balance of life on the earth and that\r\none is necessary for the other. Certain substances found in the body wastes\r\nfrom animals are necessary to the life of a green plant.\r\n\r\nInsects and Flowers.--Certain other problems can be worked out in the fall\r\nof the year. One of these is the biological interrelations between insects\r\nand flowers. It is easy on a field trip to find insects lighting upon\r\nflowers. They evidently have a reason for doing this. To find out why they\r\ngo there and what they do when there, it will be first necessary for us to\r\nstudy flowers with the idea of finding out what the insects get from them,\r\nand what the flowers get from the insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A section of a flower, cut lengthwise. In the center find\r\nthe pistil with the ovary containing a number of ovules. Around this organ\r\nnotice a circle of stalked structures, the stamens; the knobs at the end\r\ncontain pollen. The outer circles of parts are called the petals and\r\nsepals, as we go from the inside outward.]\r\n\r\nThe Use and Structure of a Flower.--It is a matter of common knowledge that\r\nflowers form fruits and that fruits contain seeds. They are, then, very\r\nimportant parts of certain plants. Our field trip shows us that flowers are\r\nof various shapes, colors, and sizes. It will now be our problem first to\r\nlearn to know the parts of a flower, and then find out how they are fitted\r\nto attract and receive insect visitors.\r\n\r\nThe Floral Envelope.--In a flower the expanded portion of the flower stalk,\r\nwhich holds the parts of the flower, is called the _receptacle_. _The green\r\nleaflike parts covering the unopened flower are called the sepals._\r\nTogether they form the _calyx_.\r\n\r\n_The more brightly colored structures are the petals._ Together they form\r\nthe _corolla_. The corolla is of importance, as we shall see later, in\r\nmaking the flower conspicuous. Frequently the petals or corolla have bright\r\nmarks or dots which lead down to the base of the cup of the flower, where a\r\nsweet fluid called _nectar_ is made and secreted. It is principally this\r\nfood substance, later made into honey by bees, that makes flowers\r\nattractive to insects.\r\n\r\nThe Essential Organs.--A flower, however, could live without sepals or\r\npetals and still do the work for which it exists. Certain _essential\r\norgans_ of the flower are within the so-called floral envelope. They\r\nconsist of the _stamens_ and _pistil_, the latter being in the center of\r\nthe flower. The structures with the knobbed ends are called _stamens_. In a\r\nsingle stamen the boxlike part at the end is the _anther_; the stalk which\r\nholds the anther is called the _filament_. The anther is in reality a\r\nhollow box which produces a large number of little grains called _pollen_.\r\nEach pistil is composed of a rather stout base called the _ovary_, and a\r\nmore or less lengthened portion rising from the ovary called the _style_.\r\nThe upper end of the style, which in some cases is somewhat broadened, is\r\ncalled the _stigma_. The free end of the stigma usually secretes a sweet\r\nfluid in which grains of pollen from flowers of the same kind can grow.\r\n\r\nInsects as Pollinating Agents.--Insects often visit flowers to obtain\r\npollen as well as nectar. In so doing they may transfer some of the pollen\r\nfrom one flower to another of the same kind. This transfer of pollen,\r\ncalled _pollination_, is of the greatest use to the plant, as we will later\r\nprove. No one who sees a hive of bees with their wonderful communal life\r\ncan fail to see that these insects play a great part in the life of the\r\nflowers near the hive. A famous observer named Sir John Lubbock tested bees\r\nand wasps to see how many trips they made daily from their homes to the\r\nflowers, and found that the wasp went out on 116 visits during a working\r\nday of 16 hours, while the bee made but a few less visits, and worked only\r\na little less time than the wasp worked. It is evident that in the course\r\nof so many trips to the fields a bee must light on hundreds of flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bumblebees. _a_, queen; _b_, worker; _c_, drone.]\r\n\r\nAdaptations in a Bee.--If we look closely at the bee, we find the body and\r\nlegs more or less covered with tiny hairs; especially are these hairs found\r\non the legs. _When a plant or animal structure is fitted to do a certain\r\nkind of work, we say it is adapted to do that work._ The joints in the leg\r\nof the bee adapt it for complicated movements; the arrangement of stiff\r\nhairs along the edge of a concavity in one of the joints of the leg forms a\r\nstructure well adapted to hold pollen. In this way pollen is collected by\r\nthe bee and taken to the hive to be used as food. But while gathering\r\npollen for itself, the dust is caught on the hairs and other projections on\r\nthe body or legs and is thus carried from flower to flower. The value of\r\nthis to a flower we will see later.\r\n\r\nField Work.--Is Color or Odor in a Flower an Attraction to an Insect?--Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock tried an experiment which it would pay a number of careful\r\npupils to repeat. He placed a few drops of honey on glass slips and placed\r\nthem over papers of various colors. In this way he found that the honeybee,\r\nfor example, could evidently distinguish different colors. Bees seemed to\r\nprefer blue to any other color. Flowers of a yellow or flesh color were\r\npreferred by flies. It would be of considerable interest for some student\r\nto work out this problem with our native bees and with other insects by\r\nusing paper flowers and honey or sirup. Test the keenness of sight in\r\ninsects by placing a white object (a white golf ball will do) in the grass\r\nand see how many insects will alight on it. Try to work out some method by\r\nwhich you can decide whether a given insect is attracted to a flower by\r\nodor alone.\r\n\r\nThe Sight of the Bumblebee.--The large eyes located on the sides of the\r\nhead are made up of a large number of little units, each of which is\r\nconsidered to be a very simple eye. The large eyes are therefore called the\r\n_compound eyes_. All insects are provided with compound eyes, with simple\r\neyes, or in most cases with both. The simple eyes of the bee may be found\r\nby a careful observer between and above the compound eyes.\r\n\r\nInsects can, as we have already learned, distinguish differences in color\r\nat some distance; they can see _moving_ objects, but they do not seem to be\r\nable to make out form well. To make up for this, they appear to have an\r\nextremely well-developed sense of smell. Insects can distinguish at a great\r\ndistance odors which to the human nose are indistinguishable. Night-flying\r\ninsects, especially, find the flowers by the odor rather than by color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The head of a bee. _A_, antennae or \"feelers\"; _E_, compound\r\neye; _S_, simple eye; _M_, mouth parts; _T_, tongue.]\r\n\r\nMouth Parts of the Bee.--The mouth of the bee is adapted to take in the\r\nfoods we have mentioned, and is used for the purposes for which man would\r\nuse the hands and fingers. The honeybee laps or sucks nectar from flowers,\r\nit chews the pollen, and it uses part of the mouth as a trowel in making\r\nthe honeycomb. The uses of the mouth parts may be made out by watching a\r\nbee on a well-opened flower.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for Field Work.--In any locality where flowers are abundant,\r\ntry to answer the following questions: How many bees visit the\r\nlocality in ten minutes? How many other insects alight on the flowers?\r\nDo bees visit flowers of the same kinds in succession, or fly from one\r\nflower on a given plant to another on a plant of a different kind? If the\r\nbee lights on a flower cluster, does it visit more than one flower in the\r\nsame cluster? How does a bee alight? Exactly what does the bee do\r\nwhen it alights?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flower cluster of \"butter and eggs.\"]\r\n\r\nButter and Eggs (_Linaria vulgaris_).--From July to October this very\r\nabundant weed may be found especially along roadsides and in sunny fields.\r\nThe flower cluster forms a tall and conspicuous cluster of orange and\r\nyellow flowers.\r\n\r\nThe corolla projects into a spur on the lower side; an upper two-parted lip\r\nshuts down upon a lower three-parted lip. The four stamens are in pairs,\r\ntwo long and two short.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram to show how the bee pollinates \"butter and eggs.\"\r\nThe bumblebee, upon entering the flower, rubs its head against the long\r\npair of anthers (_a_), then continuing to press into the flower so as to\r\nreach the nectar at (_N_) it brushes against the stigma (_S_), thus\r\npollinating the flower. Inasmuch as bees visit other flowers in the same\r\ncluster, cross-pollination would also be likely. Why?]\r\n\r\nCertain parts of the corolla are more brightly colored than the rest of the\r\nflower. This color is a guide to insects. Butter and eggs is visited most\r\nby bumblebees, which are guided by the orange lip to alight just where they\r\ncan push their way into the flower. The bee, seeking the nectar secreted in\r\nthe spur, brushes his head and shoulders against the stamens. He may then,\r\nas he pushes down after nectar, leave some pollen upon the pistil, thus\r\nassisting in _self-pollination_. Visiting another flower of the cluster, it\r\nwould be an easy matter accidentally to transfer this pollen to the stigma\r\nof another flower. In this way pollen is carried by the insect to another\r\nflower of the same kind. This is known as _cross-pollination_. _By\r\npollination we mean the transfer of pollen from an anther to the stigma of\r\na flower. Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther to the\r\nstigma of the same flower; cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from\r\nthe anthers of one flower to the stigma of another flower on the same or\r\nanother plant of the same kind._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A wild orchid, a flower of the type from which Charles\r\nDarwin worked out his theory of cross-pollination by insects.]\r\n\r\nHistory of the Discoveries regarding Pollination of Flowers.--Although the\r\nancient Greek and Roman naturalists had some vague ideas on the subject of\r\npollination, it was not until the first part of the nineteenth century that\r\na book appeared in which a German named Conrad Sprengel worked out the\r\nfacts that the structure of certain flowers seemed to be adapted to the\r\nvisits of insects. Certain facilities were offered to an insect in the way\r\nof easy foothold, sweet odor, and especially food in the shape of pollen\r\nand nectar, the latter a sweet-tasting substance manufactured by certain\r\nparts of the flower known as the nectar glands. Sprengel further discovered\r\nthe fact that pollen could be and was carried by the insect visitors from\r\nthe anthers of the flower to its stigma. It was not until the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, however, that an Englishman, Charles Darwin, applied\r\nSprengel's discoveries on the relation of insects to flowers by his\r\ninvestigations upon cross-pollination. The growth of the pollen on the\r\nstigma of the flower results eventually in the production of seeds, and\r\nthus new plants. Many species of flowers are self-pollinated and do not do\r\nso well in seed production if cross-pollinated, but Charles Darwin found\r\nthat some flowers which were self-pollinated did not produce so many seeds,\r\nand that the plants which grew from their seeds were smaller and weaker\r\nthan plants from seeds produced by cross-pollinated flowers of the same\r\nkind. He also found that plants grown from cross-pollinated seeds tended to\r\n_vary_ more than those grown from self-pollinated seed. This has an\r\nimportant bearing, as we shall see later, in the production of new\r\nvarieties of plants. Microscopic examination of the stigma at the time of\r\npollination also shows that the pollen from another flower usually\r\ngerminates before the pollen which has fallen from the anthers of the same\r\nflower. This latter fact alone in most cases renders it unlikely for a\r\nflower to produce seeds by its own pollen. Darwin worked for years on the\r\npollination of many insect-visited flowers, and discovered in almost every\r\ncase that showy, sweet-scented, or otherwise attractive flowers were\r\nadapted or fitted to be cross-pollinated by insects. He also found that, in\r\nthe case of flowers that were inconspicuous in appearance, often a\r\ncompensation appeared in the odor which rendered them attractive to certain\r\ninsects. The so-called carrion flowers, pollinated by flies, are examples,\r\nthe odor in this case being like decayed flesh. Other flowers open at\r\nnight, are white, and provided with a powerful scent. Thus they attract\r\nnight-flying moths and other insects.\r\n\r\nOther Examples of Mutual Aid between Flowers and Insects.--Many other\r\nexamples of adaptations to secure cross-pollination by means of the visits\r\nof insects might be given. The mountain laurel, which makes our hillsides\r\nso beautiful in late spring, shows a remarkable adaptation in having the\r\nanthers of the stamens caught in little pockets of the corolla. The weight\r\nof the visiting insect on the corolla releases the anther from the pocket\r\nin which it rests so that it springs up, dusting the body of the visitor\r\nwith pollen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The condition of stamens and pistils on the spiked\r\nloosestrife (_Lythrum salicaria_).]\r\n\r\nIn some flowers, as shown by the primroses or primula of our hothouses, the\r\nstamens and pistils are of different lengths in different flowers. Short\r\nstyles and long or high-placed filaments are found in one flower, and long\r\nstyles with short or low-placed filaments in the other. Pollination will be\r\neffected only when some of the pollen from a low-placed anther reaches the\r\nstigma of a short-styled flower, or when the pollen from a high anther is\r\nplaced upon a long-styled pistil. There are, as in the case of the\r\nloosestrife, flowers having pistils and stamens of three lengths. Pollen\r\nonly grows on pistils of the same length as the stamens from which it came.\r\n\r\nThe milkweed or butterfly weed already mentioned is another example of a\r\nflower adapted to insect pollination.[1]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 1: For an excellent account of cross-pollination of this\r\n     flower, the reader is referred to W. C. Stevens, _Introduction to\r\n     Botany_. Orchids are well known to botanists as showing some very\r\n     wonderful adaptations. A classic easily read is Darwin, _On the\r\n     Fertilization of Orchids_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The pronuba moth within the yucca flower.]\r\n\r\nA very remarkable instance of insect help is found in the pollination of\r\nthe yucca, a semitropical lily which lives in deserts (to be seen in most\r\nbotanic gardens). In this flower the stigmatic surface is above the anther,\r\nand the pollen is sticky and cannot be transferred except by insect aid.\r\nThis is accomplished in a remarkable manner. A little moth, called the\r\n_pronuba_, after gathering pollen from an anther, deposits an egg in the\r\novary of the pistil, and then rubs its load of pollen over the stigma of\r\nthe flower. The young hatch out and feed on the young seeds which have\r\ngrown because of the pollen placed on the stigma by the mother. The baby\r\ncaterpillars eat some of the developing seeds and later bore out of the\r\nseed pod and escape to the ground, leaving the plant to develop the\r\nremaining seeds without further molestation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The pronuba pollinating the pistil of the yucca.]\r\n\r\nThe fig insect (_Blastophaga grossorum_) is another member of the insect\r\ntribe that is of considerable economic importance. It is only in recent\r\nyears that the fruit growers of California have discovered that the\r\nfertilization of the female flowers is brought about by a gallfly which\r\nbores into the young fruit. By importing the gallflies it has been possible\r\nto grow figs where for many years it was believed that the climate\r\nprevented figs from ripening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pod of yucca showing where the young pronubas escaped.]\r\n\r\nOther Flower Visitors.--Other insects besides those already mentioned are\r\npollen carriers for flowers. Among the most useful are moths and\r\nbutterflies. Projecting from each side of the head of a butterfly is a\r\nfluffy structure, the palp. This collects and carries a large amount of\r\npollen, which is deposited upon the stigmas of other flowers when the\r\nbutterfly pushes its head down into the flower tube after nectar. The\r\nscales and hairs on the wings, legs, and body also carry pollen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A humming bird about to cross-pollinate a lily.]\r\n\r\nFlies and some other insects are agents in cross-pollination. Humming birds\r\nare also active agents in some flowers. Snails are said in rare instances\r\nto carry pollen. Man and the domesticated animals undoubtedly frequently\r\npollinate flowers by brushing past them through the fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A cornfield showing staminate and pistillate flowers, the\r\nlatter having become grains of corn. An ear of corn is a bunch of ripened\r\nfruits.]\r\n\r\nPollination by the Wind.--Not all flowers are dependent upon insects or\r\nother animals for cross-pollination. Many of the earliest of spring flowers\r\nappear almost before the insects do. Such flowers are dependent upon the\r\nwind for carrying pollen from the stamens of one flower to the pistil of\r\nanother. Most of our common trees, oak, poplar, maple, and others, are\r\ncross-pollinated almost entirely by the wind.\r\n\r\nFlowers pollinated by the wind are generally inconspicuous and often lack a\r\ncorolla. The anthers are exposed to the wind and provided with much pollen,\r\nwhile the surface of the stigma may be long and feathery. Such flowers may\r\nalso lack odor, nectar, and bright color. Can you tell why?\r\n\r\nImperfect Flowers.--Some flowers, the wind-pollinated ones in particular,\r\nare imperfect; that is, they lack either stamens or pistils. Again, in some\r\ncases, imperfect flowers having stamens only are alone found on one plant,\r\nwhile those flowers having pistils only are found on another plant of the\r\nsame kind. In such flowers, cross-pollination must of necessity follow.\r\nMany of our common trees are examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The flower of \"Lady Washington\" geranium, in which stamens\r\nand pistil ripen at different times, thus insuring cross-pollination. _A_,\r\nflower with ripe stamens; _B_, flower with stamens withered and ripe\r\npistil.]\r\n\r\nOther Cases.--The stamens and pistil ripen at different times in some\r\nflowers. The \"Lady Washington\" geranium, a common house plant, shows this\r\ncondition. Here also cross-pollination must take place if seeds are to be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nSummary.--If we now collect our observations upon flowers with a view to\r\nmaking a summary of the different devices flowers have assumed to prevent\r\nself-pollination and to secure cross-pollination, we find that they are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_(1) The stamens and pistils may be found in separate flowers, either on\r\nthe same or on different plants._\r\n\r\n_(2) The stamens may produce pollen before the pistil is ready to receive\r\nit, or vice versa._\r\n\r\n_(3) The stamens and pistils may be so placed with reference to each other\r\nthat pollination can be brought about only by outside assistance._\r\n\r\nArtificial Cross-pollination and its Practical Benefits to Man.--Artificial\r\ncross-pollination is practiced by plant breeders and can easily be tried in\r\nthe laboratory or at home. First the anthers must be carefully removed from\r\nthe bud of the flower so as to eliminate all possibility of\r\nself-pollination. The flower must then be covered so as to prevent access\r\nof pollen from without; when the ovary is sufficiently developed, pollen\r\nfrom another flower, having the characters desired, is placed on the stigma\r\nand the flower again covered to prevent any other pollen reaching the\r\nflower. The seeds from this flower when planted _may_ give rise to plants\r\nwith the best characters of each of the plants which contributed to the\r\nmaking of the seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

THE FUNCTIONS AND COMPOSITION OF LIVING THINGS\r\n\r\n_Problems.--To discover the functions of living matter._\r\n          _(a) In a living plant._\r\n          _(b) In a living animal._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Laboratory study of a living plant._--Any whole plant may\r\n       be used; a weed is preferable.\r\n     _Laboratory demonstration or home study._--The functions of\r\n       a living animal.\r\n     _Demonstration._--The growth of pollen tubes.\r\n     _Laboratory exercise._--The growth of the mature ovary into\r\n       the fruit, _e.g._ bean or pea pod.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Living Plant and a Living Animal Compared.--A walk into the fields or any\r\nvacant lot on a day in the early fall will give us first-hand acquaintance\r\nwith many common plants which, because of their ability to grow under\r\nsomewhat unfavorable conditions, are called _weeds_. Such plants--the\r\ndandelion, butter and eggs, the shepherd's purse--are particularly well\r\nfitted by nature to produce many of their kind, and by this means drive out\r\nother plants which cannot do this so well. On these or other plants we find\r\nfeeding several kinds of animals, usually insects.\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to compare, for example, a grasshopper with the plant on\r\nwhich it feeds, we see several points of likeness and difference at once.\r\nBoth plant and insect are made up of parts, each of which, as the stem of\r\nthe plant or the leg of the insect, appears to be distinct, but which is a\r\npart of the whole living plant or animal. Each part of the living plant or\r\nanimal which has a separate work to do is called an _organ_. Thus plants\r\nand animals are spoken of as living _organisms_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A weed--notice the unfavorable environment.]\r\n\r\nFunctions of the Parts of a Plant.--We are all familiar with the parts of a\r\nplant,--the root, stem, leaves, flowers, and fruit. But we may not know so\r\nmuch about their uses to the plant. Each of these structures differs from\r\nevery other part, and each has a separate work or function to perform for\r\nthe plant. _The root holds the plant firmly in the ground and takes in\r\nwater and mineral matter from the soil; the stem holds the leaves up to the\r\nlight and acts as a pathway for fluids between the root and leaves; the\r\nleaves, under certain conditions, manufacture food for the plant and\r\nbreathe; the flowers form the fruits; the fruits hold the seeds, which in\r\nturn hold young plants which are capable of reproducing adult plants of the\r\nsame kind._\r\n\r\nThe Functions of an Animal.--As we have already seen, the grasshopper has a\r\nhead, a jointed body composed of a middle and a hind part, three pairs of\r\njointed legs, and two pairs of wings. Obviously, the wings and legs are\r\nused for movement; a careful watching of the hind part of the animal shows\r\nus that breathing movements are taking place; a bit of grass placed before\r\nit may be eaten, the tiny black jaws biting little pieces out of the grass.\r\nIf disturbed, the insect hops away, and if we try to get it, it jumps or\r\nflies away, evidently seeing us before we can grasp it. Hundreds of little\r\ngrasshoppers on the grass indicate that the grasshopper can reproduce its\r\nown kind, but in other respects the animal seems quite unlike the plant.\r\nThe animal moves, breathes, feeds, and has sensation, while _apparently_\r\nthe plant does none of these. It will be the purpose of later chapters to\r\nprove that the functions of plants and animals are in many respects similar\r\nand that _both plants_ and _animals breathe_, _feed_, and _reproduce_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section through the blade of a leaf. _e_, cells of the upper\r\nsurface; _d_, cells of the lower surface; _i_, air spaces in the leaf; _v_,\r\nvein in cross sections; _p_, green cells.]\r\n\r\nOrgans.--If we look carefully at the organ of a plant called a leaf, we\r\nfind that the materials of which it is composed do not appear to be\r\neverywhere the same. The leaf is much thinner and more delicate in some\r\nparts than in others. Holding the flat, expanded blade away from the branch\r\nis a little stalk, which extends into the blade of the leaf. Here it splits\r\nup into a network of tiny \"veins\" which evidently form a framework for the\r\nflat blade somewhat as the sticks of a kite hold the paper in place. If we\r\nexamine under the compound microscope a thin section cut across the leaf,\r\nwe shall find that the veins as well as the other parts are made up of many\r\ntiny boxlike units of various sizes and shapes. These smallest units of\r\nbuilding material of the plant or animal disclosed by the compound\r\nmicroscope are called _cells_. The organs of a plant or animal are built of\r\nthese tiny structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Several cells of _Elodea_, a water plant. _chl._,\r\nchlorophyll bodies; _c.s._, cell sap; _c.w._, cell wall; _n._, nucleus;\r\n_p._, protoplasm. The arrows show the direction of the protoplasmic\r\nmovement.]\r\n\r\nTissues.[2]--The cells which form certain parts of the veins, the flat\r\nblade, or other portions of the plant, are often found in groups or\r\ncollections, the cells of which are more or less alike in size and shape.\r\nSuch a collection of cells is called a _tissue_. Examples of tissues are\r\nthe cells covering the outside of the human body, the muscle cells, which\r\ncollectively allow of movement, bony tissues which form the framework to\r\nwhich the muscles are attached, and many others.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 2: _To the Teacher._--Any simple plant or animal\r\n     tissue can be used to demonstrate the cell. Epidermal cells\r\n     may be stripped from the body of the frog or obtained by\r\n     scraping the inside of one's mouth. The thin skin from an\r\n     onion stained with tincture of iodine shows well, as do thin\r\n     sections of a young stem, as the bean or pea. One of the\r\n     best places to study a tissue and the cells of which it is\r\n     composed is in the leaf of a green water plant, _Elodea_. In\r\n     this plant the cells are large, and not only their outline,\r\n     but the movement of the living matter within the cells, may\r\n     easily be seen, and the parts described in the next\r\n     paragraph can be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A cell. _ch._, chromosomes; _c.w._, cell wall; _n._,\r\nnucleus; _p._, protoplasm.]\r\n\r\nCells.--_A cell may be defined as a tiny mass of living matter containing a\r\nnucleus, either living alone or forming a unit of the building material of\r\na living thing._ The living matter of which all cells are formed is known\r\nas _protoplasm_ (formed from two Greek words meaning _first form_). If we\r\nexamine under a compound microscope a small bit of the water plant\r\n_Elodea_, we see a number of structures resembling bricks in a wall. Each\r\n\"brick,\" however, is really a plant cell bounded by a thin wall. If we look\r\ncarefully, we can see that the material inside of this wall is slowly\r\nmoving and is carrying around in its substance a number of little green\r\nbodies. This moving substance is living matter, the protoplasm of the cell.\r\nThe green bodies (the _chlorophyll_ bodies) we shall learn more about\r\nlater; they are found only in plant cells. All plant and animal cells\r\nappear to be alike in the fact that every living cell possesses a structure\r\nknown as the _nucleus_ (pl. _nuclei_), which is found within the body of\r\nthe cell. This nucleus is not easy to find in the cells of _Elodea_. Within\r\nthe nucleus of all cells are found certain bodies called _chromosomes_.\r\nThese chromosomes in a given plant or animal are always constant in number.\r\nThese chromosomes are supposed to be the bearers of the qualities which we\r\nbelieve can be handed down from plant to plant and from animal to animal,\r\nin other words, the inheritable qualities which make the offspring like its\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nHow Cells form Others.--Cells grow to a certain size and then split into\r\ntwo new cells. In this process, which is of very great importance in the\r\ngrowth of both plants and animals, the nucleus divides first. The\r\nchromosomes also divide, each splitting lengthwise and the parts going in\r\nequal numbers to each of the two cells formed from the old cell. In this\r\nway the matter in the chromosomes is divided equally between the two new\r\ncells. Then the rest of the protoplasm separates, and two new cells are\r\nformed. This process is known as _fission_. It is the usual method of\r\ngrowth found in the tissues of plants and animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stages in the division of one cell to form two. Which part\r\nof the cell divides first? What seems to become of the chromosomes?]\r\n\r\nCells of Various Sizes and Shapes.--Plant cells and animal cells are of\r\nvery diverse shapes and sizes. There are cells so large that they can\r\neasily be seen with the unaided eye; for example, the root hairs of plants\r\nand eggs of some animals. On the other hand, cells may be so minute, as in\r\nthe case of the plant cells named bacteria, that several million might be\r\npresent in a few drops of milk. The forms of cells may be extremely varied\r\nin different tissues; they may assume the form of cubes, columns, spheres,\r\nflat plates, or may be extremely irregular in shape. One kind of tissue\r\ncell, found in man, has a body so small as to be quite invisible to the\r\nnaked eye, although it has a prolongation several feet in length. Such are\r\nsome of the cells of the nervous system of man and other large animals, as\r\nthe ox, elephant, and whale.\r\n\r\nVarying Sizes of Living Things.--Plant cells and animal cells may live\r\nalone, or they may form collections of cells. Some plants are so simple in\r\nstructure as to be formed of only one kind of cells. Usually living\r\norganisms are composed of several groups of different kinds of cells. It is\r\nonly necessary to call attention to the fact that such collections of cells\r\nmay form organisms so tiny as to be barely visible to the eye; as, for\r\ninstance, some of the small flowerless plants or many of the tiny animals\r\nliving in fresh water or salt water. On the other hand, among animals, the\r\nbulk of the elephant and whale, and among plants the big trees of\r\nCalifornia, stand out as notable examples. The large plants and animals are\r\nmade up of _more_, not necessarily larger, cells.\r\n\r\nWhat Protoplasm can Do.--It responds to influences or stimulation from\r\nwithout its own substance. Both plants and animals are sensitive to touch\r\nor stimulation by light, heat or cold, certain chemical substances,\r\ngravity, and electricity. Green plants turn toward the source of light.\r\nSome animals are attracted to light and others repelled by it; the\r\nearthworm is an example of the latter. _Protoplasm is thus said to be\r\nirritable._\r\n\r\n_Protoplasm has the power to contract and to move._ Muscular movement is a\r\nfamiliar instance of this power. Movement may also take place in plants.\r\nSome plants fold up their leaves at night; others, like the sensitive\r\nplant, fold their leaflets when touched.\r\n\r\n_Protoplasm can form new living matter out of food._ To do this, food\r\nmaterials must be absorbed into the cells of the living organism. To make\r\nprotoplasm, it is evident that the same chemical elements must enter into\r\nthe composition of the food substances as are found in living matter. The\r\nsimplest plants and animals have this wonderful power as certainly\r\ndeveloped as the most complex forms of life.\r\n\r\n_Protoplasm, be it in plant or animal, breathes and throws off waste\r\nmaterials._ When a living thing does work oxygen unites with food in the\r\nbody; the food is burned or _oxidized_ and work is done by means of the\r\nenergy released from the food. The waste materials are _excreted_ or passed\r\nout. Plants and animals alike pass off the carbon dioxide which results\r\nfrom the oxidation of food and of parts of their own bodies. Animals\r\neliminate wastes containing nitrogen through the skin and the kidneys.\r\n\r\n_Protoplasm can reproduce, that is, form other matter like itself._ New\r\nplants are constantly appearing to take the places of those that die. The\r\nsupply of living things upon the earth is not decreasing; reproduction is\r\nconstantly taking place. In a general way it is possible to say that plants\r\nand animals reproduce in a very similar manner.\r\n\r\nThe Importance of Reproduction.--Reproduction is the final process that\r\nplants and animals are called upon to perform. Without the formation of\r\n_new_ living things no progress would be possible on the earth. We have\r\nfound that insects help flowering plants in this process. Let us now see\r\nexactly what happens when pollen is placed by the bee on the stigma of\r\nanother flower of the same kind. To understand this process of reproduction\r\nin flowers, we must first study carefully pollen grains from the anther of\r\nsome growing flower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pollen grains of different shapes and sizes.]\r\n\r\nPollen.--Pollen grains of various flowers, when seen under the microscope,\r\ndiffer greatly in form and appearance. Some are relatively large, some\r\nsmall, some rough, others smooth, some spherical, and others angular. They\r\nall agree, however, in having a thick wall, with a thin membrane under it,\r\nthe whole inclosing a mass of protoplasm. At an early stage the pollen\r\ngrain contains but a single cell. A little later, however, two nuclei may\r\nbe found in the protoplasm. Hence we know that at least two cells exist\r\nthere, one of which is called the sperm cell; its nucleus is the sperm\r\nnucleus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A pollen grain greatly magnified. Two nuclei are found (_n_,\r\n_n'_) at this stage of its growth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three stages in the germination of the pollen grain. The\r\nnuclei in the tube in (3) are the sperm nuclei. Drawn under the compound\r\nmicroscope.]\r\n\r\nGrowth of Pollen Grains.--Under certain conditions a pollen grain will grow\r\nor germinate. This growth can be artificially produced in the laboratory by\r\nsprinkling pollen from well-opened flowers of sweet pea or nasturtium on a\r\nsolution of 15 parts of sugar to 100 of water. Left for a few hours in a\r\nwarm and moist place and then examined under the microscope, the grains of\r\npollen will be found to have germinated, a long, threadlike mass of\r\nprotoplasm growing from it into the sugar solution. The presence of this\r\nsugar solution was sufficient to induce growth. When the pollen grain\r\ngerminates, the nuclei enter the threadlike growth (this growth is called\r\nthe pollen tube; see Figure). One of the nuclei which grows into the pollen\r\ntube is known as the _sperm nucleus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fertilization of the ovule. A flower cut down lengthwise\r\n(only one side shown). The pollen tube is seen entering the ovule. _a_,\r\nanther; _f_, filament; _pg_, pollen grain; _s_, stigmatic surface; _pt_,\r\npollen tube; _st_, style; _o_, ovary; _m_, micropyle; _sp_, space within\r\novary; _e_, egg cell; _P_, petal; _S_, sepal.]\r\n\r\nFertilization of the Flower.--If we cut the pistil of a large flower (as a\r\nlily) lengthwise, we notice that the style appears to be composed of rather\r\nspongy material in the interior; the ovary is hollow and is seen to contain\r\na number of rounded structures which appear to grow out from the wall of\r\nthe ovary. These are the _ovules_. The ovules, under certain conditions,\r\nwill become _seeds_. An explanation of these conditions may be had if we\r\nexamine, under the microscope, a very thin section of a pistil, on which\r\npollen has begun to germinate. The central part of the style is found to be\r\neither hollow or composed of a soft tissue through which the pollen tube\r\ncan easily grow.  Upon germination, the pollen tube grows downward through\r\nthe spongy center of the style, follows the path of least resistance to the\r\nspace within the ovary, and there enters the ovule.  It is believed that\r\nsome chemical influence thus attracts the pollen tube. When it reaches the\r\novary, the sperm cell penetrates an ovule by making its way through a\r\nlittle hole called the _micropyle_. It then grows toward a clear bit of\r\nprotoplasm known as the _embryo sac_. The embryo sac is an ovoid space,\r\nmicroscopic in size, filled with semifluid protoplasm containing several\r\nnuclei. (See Figure.) _One of the nuclei, with the protoplasm immediately\r\nsurrounding it, is called the egg cell._ It is this cell that the sperm\r\nnucleus of the pollen tube grows toward; ultimately the sperm nucleus\r\nreaches the egg nucleus and unites with it. _The two nuclei, after coming\r\ntogether, unite to form a single cell. This process is known as\r\nfertilization._ This single cell formed by the union of the pollen tube\r\ncell or sperm and the egg cell is now called a _fertilized egg_.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of Ovule into Seed.--_The primary reason for the existence of a\r\nflower is that it may produce seeds from which future plants will grow.\r\nAfter fertilization the ovule grows into a seed._ The first beginning of\r\nthe growth of the seed takes place at the moment of fertilization. From\r\nthat time on there is a growth of the fertilized egg within the ovule which\r\nmakes a baby plant called the _embryo_. _The embryo will give rise to the\r\nadult plant._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The fruit of the locust, a bean-like fruit. _p_, the\r\nattachment to the placenta; _s_, the stigma.]\r\n\r\nA Typical Fruit,--the Pea or Bean Pod.--If a withered flower of any one of\r\nthe pea or bean family is examined carefully, it will be found that the\r\npistil of the flower continues to grow after the rest of the flower\r\nwithers. If we remove the pistil from such a flower and examine it\r\ncarefully, we find that it is the ovary that has enlarged. The space within\r\nthe ovary has become nearly filled with a number of nearly ovoid bodies,\r\nattached along one edge of the inner wall. These we recognize as the young\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nThe pod of a bean, pea, or locust illustrates well the growth from the\r\nflower. The pod, which is in reality a ripened ovary with other parts of\r\nthe pistil attached to it, is considered as a _fruit_. By definition, _a\r\nfruit is a ripened ovary and its contents together with any parts of the\r\nflower that may be attached to it_. The chief use of the fruit to the\r\nflower is to hold and to protect the seeds; it may ultimately distribute\r\nthem where they can reproduce young plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The development of an apple. Notice that in this fruit\r\nadditional parts besides the ovary (_o_) become part of the fruit. Certain\r\nouter parts of the flower, the sepals (_s_) and receptacle, become the\r\nfleshy part of the fruit, while the ovary becomes the core. Stages numbered\r\n1 to 7 are in the order of development.]\r\n\r\nThe Necessity of Fruit and Seed Dispersal to a Plant.--We have seen that\r\nthe chief reason for flowers, from the plant's standpoint, is to produce\r\nfruits which contain seeds. Reproduction and the ultimate scattering of\r\nfruits and seeds are absolutely necessary in order that colonies of plants\r\nmay reach new localities. It is evident that plants best fitted to scatter\r\ntheir seeds, or place fruits containing the seeds some little distance from\r\nthe parent plants, are the ones which will spread most rapidly. A plant, if\r\nit is to advance into new territory, must get its seeds there first. Plants\r\nwhich are best fitted to do this are the most widely distributed on the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nHow Seeds and Fruits are Scattered.--Seed dispersal is accomplished in many\r\ndifferent ways. Some plants produce enormous numbers of seeds which may or\r\nmay not have special devices to aid in their scattering. Most weeds are\r\nthus started \"in pastures new.\" Some prolific plants, like the milkweed,\r\nhave _seeds_ with a little tuft of hairlike down which allows them to be\r\ncarried by the wind. Others, as the omnipresent dandelion, have their\r\n_fruits_ provided with a similar structure, the pappus. Some plants, as the\r\nburdock and clotbur, have fruits provided with tiny hooks which stick to\r\nthe hair of animals, thus proving a means of transportation. Most fleshy\r\nfruits contain indigestible seeds, so that when the fruits are eaten by\r\nanimals the seeds are passed off from the body unharmed and may, if\r\nfavorably placed, grow. Nuts of various kinds are often carried off by\r\nanimals, buried, and forgotten, to grow later. Such are a few of the ways\r\nin which seeds are scattered. All other things being equal, the plants best\r\nequipped to scatter seeds or fruits are those which will drive out other\r\nplants in a given locality. Because of their adaptations they are likely to\r\nbe very numerous, and when unfavorable conditions come, for that reason, if\r\nfor no other, are likely to survive. Such plants are best exemplified in\r\nthe weeds of the grassplots and gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

Two sets of factors are necessary for its growth: first, the\r\npresence of food to give the young plant a start; second, certain\r\nstimulating factors outside the young plant, such as water and heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three views of a kidney bean, the lower one having one\r\ncotyledon removed to show the hypocotyl and plumule.]\r\n\r\nIf we open a bean pod, we find the seeds lying along one edge of the pod,\r\neach attached by a little stalk to the inner wall of the ovary. If we pull\r\na single bean from its attachment, we find that the stalk leaves a scar on\r\nthe coat of the bean; this scar is called the _hilum_. The tiny hole near\r\nthe hilum is called the _micropyle_. Turn back to the figure (page 54)\r\nshowing the ovule in the ovary. Find there the little hole through which\r\nthe pollen tube reached the embryo sac. This hole is identical with the\r\nmicropyle in the seed. The thick outer coat (the _testa_) is easily removed\r\nfrom a soaked bean, the delicate coat under it easily escaping notice. The\r\nseed separates into two parts; these are called the _cotyledons_. If you\r\npull apart the cotyledons very carefully, you find certain other structures\r\nbetween them. The rodlike part is called the _hypocotyl_ (meaning _under\r\nthe cotyledons_). This will later form the root (and part of the stem) of\r\nthe young bean plant. The first true leaves, very tiny structures, are\r\nfolded together between the cotyledons. That part of the plant above the\r\ncotyledons is known as the _plumule_ or _epicotyl_ (meaning _above the\r\ncotyledons_). All the parts of the seed within the seed coats together form\r\nthe _embryo_ or young plant. A bean seed contains, then, a tiny _plant_\r\nprotected by a tough coat.\r\n\r\nFood in the Cotyledons.--The problem now before us is to find out how the\r\nembryo of the bean is adapted to grow into an adult plant. Up to this stage\r\nof its existence it has had the advantage of food and protection from the\r\nparent plant. Now it must begin the battle of life alone. We shall find in\r\nall our work with plants and animals that the problem of food supply is\r\nalways the most important problem to be solved by the growing organism. Let\r\nus see if the embryo is able to get a start in life (which many animals get\r\nin the egg) from food provided for it within its own body.\r\n\r\nOrganic Nutrients.--Organic foods (those which come from living sources)\r\nare made up of two kinds of substances, the _nutrients_ or food substances\r\nand _wastes_ or _refuse_. An egg, for example, contains the white and the\r\nyolk, composed of nutrients, and the shell, which is waste. The organic\r\nnutrients are classed in three groups.\r\n\r\n_Carbohydrates_, foods which contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a\r\ncertain fixed proportion (C{6}H{10}O{5} is an example). They are the\r\nsimplest of these very complex chemical compounds we call organic\r\nnutrients. Starch and sugar are common examples of carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n_Fats and Oils._--These foods are also composed of carbon, hydrogen, and\r\noxygen in a proportion which enables them to unite readily with oxygen.\r\n\r\n_Proteins._--A third group of organic foods, proteins, are the most complex\r\nof all in their composition, and have, besides carbon, oxygen, and\r\nhydrogen, the element nitrogen and minute quantities of other elements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Starch grains in the cells of a potato tuber.]\r\n\r\nTest for Starch.--If we boil water with a piece of laundry starch in a test\r\ntube, then cool it and add to the mixture two or three drops of iodine\r\nsolution,[3] we find that the mixture in the test tube turns purple or deep\r\nblue. It has been discovered by experiment that starch, and no _other known\r\nsubstance_, will be turned purple or dark blue by iodine. Therefore, iodine\r\nsolution has come to be used as a test for the presence of starch.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 3: Iodine solution is made by simply adding a few\r\n     crystals of the element iodine to 95 per cent alcohol; or,\r\n     better, take by weight 1 gram of iodine crystals, 2/3 gram\r\n     of iodide of potassium, and dilute to a dark brown color in\r\n     weak alcohol (35 per cent) or distilled water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Test for Starch.]\r\n\r\nStarch in the Bean.--If we mash up a little piece of a bean cotyledon which\r\nhas been previously soaked in water, and test for starch with iodine\r\nsolution, the characteristic blue-black color appears, showing the presence\r\nof the starch. If a little of the stained material is mounted in water on a\r\nglass slide under the compound microscope, you will find that the starch is\r\nin the form of little ovoid bodies called _starch grains_. The starch\r\ngrains and other food products are made use of by the growing plant.\r\n\r\nTest for Oils.--If the substance believed to contain oil is rubbed on brown\r\npaper or is placed on paper and then heated in an oven, the presence of oil\r\nwill be known by a translucent spot on the paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Test for protein.]\r\n\r\nProtein in the Bean.--Another nutrient present in the bean cotyledon is\r\n_protein_. Several tests are used to detect the presence of this nutrient.\r\nThe following is one of the best known:--\r\n\r\nPlace in a test tube the substance to be tested; for example, a bit of\r\nhard-boiled egg. Pour over it a little strong (60 per cent) nitric acid and\r\nheat gently. Note the color that appears--a lemon yellow. If the egg is\r\nwashed in water and a little ammonium hydrate added, the color changes to a\r\ndeep orange, showing that a protein is present.\r\n\r\nIf the protein is in a liquid state, its presence may be proved by heating,\r\nfor when it coagulates or thickens, as does the white of an egg when\r\nboiled, protein in the form of an _albumin_ is present.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic protein test easily made at home is burning the\r\nsubstance. If it burns with the odor of burning feathers or leather, then\r\nprotein forms part of its composition.[4]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 4: Other tests somewhat more reliable, but much\r\n     more delicate, are the biuret test and test with Millon's\r\n     reagent.\r\n\r\nA test of the cotyledon of a bean for protein food with nitric acid and\r\nammonium hydrate shows us the presence of this food. Beans are found by\r\nactual test to contain about 23 per cent of protein, 59 per cent of\r\ncarbohydrates, and about 2 per cent oils. The young plant within a pea or\r\nbean is thus shown to be well supplied with nourishment until it is able to\r\ntake care of itself. In this respect it is somewhat like a young animal\r\nwithin the egg, a bird or fish, for example.\r\n\r\nBeans and Peas as Food for Man.--So much food is stored in legumes (as\r\nbeans and peas) that man has come to consider them a very valuable and\r\ncheap source of food. Study carefully the following table:--\r\n\r\n       NUTRIENTS FURNISHED FOR TEN CENTS IN BEANS AND PEAS AT\r\n                      CERTAIN PRICES PER POUND\r\n\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n                       |        |        TEN CENTS WILL PAY FOR\r\n                       | PRICES |------------------------------------------\r\n  FOOD MATERIALS       |  PER   |  TOTAL  |         |        |\r\n   AS PURCHASED        | POUND  |  FOOD   | PROTEIN |  FAT   |CARBOHYDRATES\r\n                       |        |MATERIAL |         |        |\r\n  ---------------------|--------|---------|---------|--------|-------------\r\n                       | _Cents_| _Pounds_| _Pounds_|_Pounds_|  _Pounds_\r\n  Kidney beans, dried  |   5    |   2.00  |   0.45  |  0.04  |    1.19\r\n  Lima beans, fresh,   |        |         |         |        |\r\n   shelled             |   8    |   1.25  |    .04  |   --   |     .12\r\n  Lima beans, dried    |   6    |   1.67  |    .30  |   .03  |    1.10\r\n  String beans, fresh, |        |         |         |        |\r\n   30 cents per peck   |   3    |   3.33  |    .07  |   .01  |     .23\r\n  Beans, baked, canned |   5    |   2.00  |    .14  |   .05  |     .39\r\n  Lentils, dried       |  10    |   1.00  |    .26  |   .01  |     .59\r\n  Peas, green, in pod, |        |         |         |        |\r\n   30 cents per peck   |   3    |   3.33  |    .12  |   .01  |     .33\r\n  Peas, dried          |   4    |   2.50  |    .62  |   .03  |    1.55\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A series of early stages in the germination of the kidney\r\nbean.]\r\n\r\nGermination of the Bean.--If dry seeds are planted in sawdust or earth,\r\nthey will not grow. A moderate supply of water must be given to them. If\r\nseeds were to be kept in a freezing temperature or at a very high\r\ntemperature, no growth would take place. A moderate temperature and a\r\nmoderate water supply are most favorable for their development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bean seedlings. The older seedlings at the left have used up\r\nall of the food supply in the cotyledons.]\r\n\r\nIf some beans were planted so that we might make a record of their growth,\r\nwe would find the first signs of germination to be the breaking of the\r\ntesta and the pushing outward of the hypocotyl to form the first root. A\r\nlittle later the hypocotyl begins to curve downward. A later stage shows\r\nthe hypocotyl lifting the cotyledon upward. In consequence the hypocotyl\r\nforms an arch, dragging after it the bulky cotyledons. The stem, as soon as\r\nit is released from the ground, straightens out. From between the\r\ncotyledons the budlike plumule or epicotyl grows upward, forming the first\r\ntrue leaves and all of the stem above the cotyledons. As growth continues,\r\nwe notice that the cotyledons become smaller and smaller, until their food\r\ncontents are completely absorbed into the young plant. The young plant is\r\nnow able to care for itself and may be said to have passed through the\r\nstages of germination.\r\n\r\nWhat makes an Engine Go.--If we examine the sawdust or soil in which the\r\nseeds are growing, we find it forced up by the growing seed. Evidently work\r\nwas done; in other words, _energy_ was released by the seeds. A familiar\r\nexample of release of energy is seen in an engine. Coal is placed in the\r\nfirebox and lighted, the lower door of the furnace is then opened so as to\r\nmake a draft of air which will reach the coal. You know the result. The\r\ncoal burns, heat is given off, causing the water in the boiler to make\r\nsteam, the engine wheels to turn, and work to be done. Let us see what\r\nhappens from the chemical standpoint.\r\n\r\nCoal, Organic Matter.--Coal is made largely from dead plants, long since\r\npressed into its present hard form. It contains a large amount of a\r\nchemical element called carbon, the presence of which is characteristic of\r\nall organic material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The limewater test. The tube at the right shows the effect\r\nof the carbon dioxide.]\r\n\r\nOxidation, its Results.--When things containing carbon are lighted, they\r\nburn. If we place a lighted candle which contains carbon in a closed glass\r\njar, the candle soon goes out. If we then carefully test the air in the jar\r\nwith a substance known as _limewater_,[5] the latter, when shaken up with\r\nthe air in the jar, turns milky. This test proves the presence in the jar\r\nof a gas, known as _carbon dioxide_. This gas is formed by the carbon of\r\nthe candle uniting with the oxygen in the air. When the oxygen of the air\r\nin the jar was used up, the flame went out, showing that oxygen is\r\nnecessary to make a thing burn. This uniting of oxygen with some other\r\nsubstance is called _oxidation_.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 5: Limewater can be made by shaking up a piece of\r\n     quicklime the size of your fist in about two quarts of\r\n     water. Filter or strain the limewater into bottles and it is\r\n     ready for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram to show that when a piece of wood is burned it forms\r\nwater and carbon dioxide.]\r\n\r\nOxidation possible without a Flame.--But a flame is not necessary for\r\noxidation. Iron, if left in a damp place, becomes rusty. A union between\r\nthe oxygen in the water or air and the iron makes what is known as iron\r\noxide or rust. This is an example of _slow oxidation_.\r\n\r\nOxidation in our Bodies.--If we expel the air from our lungs through a tube\r\ninto a bottle of limewater, we notice the limewater becomes milky.\r\nEvidently carbon dioxide is formed in our own bodies and oxidation takes\r\nplace there. Is it fair to believe that the heat of our body (for example,\r\n98.6 deg. Fahrenheit under the tongue) is due to oxidation within the body, and\r\nthat the work we do results from this chemical process. If so, what is\r\noxidized?\r\n\r\nEnergy comes from Foods.--From the foregoing experiment it is evident that\r\nfood is oxidized within the human body to release energy for our daily\r\nwork. Is it not logical to suppose that all living things, both plant and\r\nanimal, release energy as the result of oxidation of foods within their\r\ncells? Let us see if this is true in the case of the pea.\r\n\r\nFood oxidized in Germinating Seeds.--If we take equal numbers of soaked\r\npeas, placed in two bottles, one tightly stoppered, the other having no\r\nstopper, both bottles being exposed to identical conditions of light,\r\ntemperature, and moisture, we find that the seeds in both bottles start to\r\ngerminate, but that those in the closed bottle soon stop, while those in\r\nthe open jar continue to grow almost as well as similar seeds placed in an\r\nopen dish would.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment that shows the necessity for air in germination.]\r\n\r\nWhy did not the seeds in the covered jar germinate? To answer this\r\nquestion, let us carefully remove the stopper from the stoppered jar and\r\ninsert a lighted candle. The candle goes out at once. The surer test of\r\nlimewater shows the presence of carbon dioxide in the jar. The carbon of\r\nthe foodstuffs of the pea united with the oxygen of the air, forming carbon\r\ndioxide. Growth stopped as soon as the oxygen was exhausted. The presence\r\nof carbon dioxide in the jar is an indication that a very important process\r\nwhich we associate with animals rather than plants, that of _respiration_,\r\nis taking place. The seed, in order to release the energy locked up in its\r\nfood supply, must have oxygen, so that the oxidation of the food may take\r\nplace. _Hence a constant supply of fresh air is an important factor in\r\ngermination._ It is important that air should penetrate between the grains\r\nof soil around a seed. The frequent stirring of the soil enables the air to\r\nreach the seed. Air also acts upon some materials in the soil and puts them\r\nin a form that the germinating seed can use. This necessity for oxygen\r\nshows us at least one reason why the farmer plows and harrows a field and\r\none important use of the earthworm. Explain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A grain of corn cut lengthwise. _C_, cotyledon; _E_,\r\nendosperm; _H_, hypocotyl; _P_, plumule.]\r\n\r\nStructure of a Grain of Corn.--Examination of a well-soaked grain of corn\r\ndiscloses a difference in the two flat sides of the grain. A light-colored\r\narea found on one surface marks the position of the embryo; the rest of the\r\ngrain contains the food supply. The interesting thing to remember here is\r\nthat the food supply is _outside_ of the embryo.\r\n\r\nA grain cut lengthwise perpendicular to the flat side and then dipped in\r\nweak iodine shows two distinct parts, an area containing considerable\r\nstarch, the _endosperm_, and the embryo or young plant. Careful inspection\r\nshows the hypocotyl and plumule (the latter pointing toward the free end of\r\nthe grain) and a part surrounding them, the _single_ cotyledon (see\r\nFigure). Here again we have an example of a fitting for future needs, for\r\nin this fruit the one seed has at hand all the food material necessary for\r\nrapid growth, although the food is here outside the embryo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longitudinal section of young ear of corn. _O_, the fruits;\r\n_S_, the stigmas; _SH_, the sheath-like leaves; _ST_, the flower stalk.\r\n(After Sargent.)]\r\n\r\nEndosperm the Food Supply of Corn.--We find that the one cotyledon of the\r\ncorn grain does not serve the same purpose to the young plant as do the two\r\ncotyledons of the bean. Although we find a little starch in the corn\r\ncotyledon, still it is evident from our tests that the endosperm is the\r\nchief source of food supply. The study of a thin section of the corn grain\r\nunder the compound microscope shows us that the starch grains in the\r\nendosperm are large and regular in size. When the grain has begun to grow,\r\nexamination shows that the starch grains near the edge of the cotyledon are\r\nmuch smaller and quite irregular, having large holes in them. We know that\r\nthe germinating grain has a much sweeter taste than that which is not\r\ngrowing. This is noticed in sprouting barley or malt. We shall later find\r\nthat, in order to make use of starchy food, a plant or animal must in some\r\nmanner change it over to sugar. This change is necessary, because starch\r\nwill not dissolve in water, while sugar will; in this form substances can\r\npass from cell to cell in the plant and thus distribute the food where it\r\nis needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Test for grape sugar.]\r\n\r\nA Test for Grape Sugar.--Place in a test tube the substance to be tested\r\nand heat it in a little water so as to dissolve the sugar. Add to the fluid\r\ntwice its bulk of Fehling's solution,[6] which has been previously\r\nprepared. Heat the mixture, which should now have a blue color, in the test\r\ntube. If grape sugar is present in considerable quantity, the contents of\r\nthe tube will turn first a greenish, then yellow, and finally a brick-red\r\ncolor. Smaller amounts will show less decided red. No other substance than\r\nsugar will give this reaction. If Benedict's test[7] is used, a colored\r\nprecipitate will appear in the test tube after boiling.\r\n\r\n     Footnotes 6 and 7: Directions for making these solutions\r\n     will be found in Hunter's _Laboratory Problems in Civic\r\n     Biology_.\r\n\r\nStarch changed to Grape Sugar in the Corn.--That starch is being changed to\r\ngrape sugar in the germinating corn grain can easily be shown if we cut\r\nlengthwise through the embryos of half a dozen grains of corn that have\r\njust begun to germinate, place them in a test tube with some Fehling's\r\nsolution, and heat almost to the boiling point. They will be found to give\r\na reaction showing the presence of sugar along the edge of the cotyledon\r\nand between it and the endosperm.\r\n\r\nDigestion.--This change of starch to grape sugar in the corn is a process\r\nof _digestion_. If you chew a bit of unsweetened cracker in the mouth for a\r\nlittle time, it will begin to taste sweet, and if the chewed cracker, which\r\nwe know contains starch, is tested with Fehling's solution, some of the\r\nstarch will be found to have changed to grape sugar. Here, again, a process\r\nof digestion has taken place. In both the corn and in the mouth, the change\r\nis brought about by the action of peculiar substances known as digestive\r\nferments, or _enzymes_. Such substances have the power under certain\r\nconditions to change insoluble foods--solids--into soluble\r\nsubstances--liquids. The result is that substances which before digestion\r\nwould not dissolve in water now will dissolve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A germinating corn grain. _C_, cotyledon; _H_, growing root\r\n(_hypocotyl_); _P_, growing stem (_plumule_); _S_, endosperm; _d.s._,\r\ndigested starch; _p.r._, primary root; _s.r._, secondary root; _r.h._, root\r\nhairs.]\r\n\r\nThe Action of Diastase on Starch.--The enzyme found in the cotyledon of the\r\ncorn, which changes starch to grape sugar, is called _diastase_. It may be\r\nseparated from the cotyledon and used in the form of a powder.\r\n\r\nTo a little starch in half a cup of water we add a very little (1 gram) of\r\ndiastase and put the vessel containing the mixture in a warm place, where\r\nthe temperature will remain nearly constant at about 98 deg. Fahrenheit. On\r\ntesting part of the contents at the end of half an hour, and the remainder\r\nthe next morning, for starch and for grape sugar, we find from the morning\r\ntest that the starch has been almost completely changed to grape sugar.\r\nStarch and warm water alone under similar conditions will not react to the\r\ntest for grape sugar.\r\n\r\nDigestion has the Same Purpose in Plants and Animals.--In our own bodies we\r\nknow that solid foods taken into the mouth are broken up by the teeth and\r\nmoistened by saliva. If we could follow that food, we would find that\r\neventually it became part of the blood. It was made soluble by digestion,\r\nand in a liquid form was able to reach the blood. Once a part of the body,\r\nthe food is used either to release energy or to build up the body.\r\n\r\nSummary.--We have seen:\r\n\r\n1. That seeds, in order to grow, must possess a food supply either in or\r\naround their bodies.\r\n\r\n2. That this food supply must be oxidized before energy is released.\r\n\r\n3. That in cases where the food is not stored at the point where it is to\r\nbe oxidized the food must be digested so that it may be transported from\r\none part to another in the same plant.\r\n\r\nThe life processes of plants and animals, so far, may be considered as\r\nalike; they both feed, breathe (oxidize their food), do work, and grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

THE ORGANS OF NUTRITION IN PLANTS--THE SOIL AND ITS RELATION TO THE\r\nROOTS\r\n\r\n_Problem.--What a plant takes from the soil and how it gets it._\r\n         _(a) What determines the direction of growth of roots?_\r\n         _(b) How is the root built?_\r\n         _(d) What is in the soil that a root might take out?_\r\n         _(e) Why is nitrogen necessary, and how is it obtained?_\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Demonstration_.--Roots of bean or pea.\r\n     _Demonstration or home experiment_.--Response of root to\r\n       gravity and to water.

Drawing.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Root hair under compound microscope.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Apparatus illustrating osmosis.\r\n     _Demonstration or a home experiment._--Organic matter\r\n       present in soil.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Root tubercles of legume.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Nutrients present in some roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nUses of the Root.--If one of the seedlings of the bean spoken of in the\r\nlast chapter is allowed to grow in sawdust and is given light, air, and\r\nwater, sooner or later it will die. Soil is part of its natural\r\nenvironment, and the roots which come in contact with the soil are very\r\nimportant. It is the purpose of this chapter to find out just how the young\r\nplant is fitted to get what it needs from this part of its environment;\r\nnamely, the soil.\r\n\r\nThe development of a bean seedling has shown us that the root grows first.\r\n_One of the most important functions of the root to a young seed plant is\r\nthat of a holdfast, an anchor to fasten it in the place where it is to\r\ndevelop._ It has many other uses, as the taking in of water with the\r\nmineral and organic matter dissolved therein, the storage of food,\r\nclimbing, etc. All functions other than the first one stated arise after\r\nthe young plant has begun to develop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A root system, showing primary and secondary roots.]\r\n\r\nRoot System.--If you dig up a young bean seedling and carefully wash the\r\ndirt from the roots, you will see that a long root is developed as a\r\ncontinuation of the hypocotyl. This root is called the _primary_ root.\r\nOther smaller roots which grow from the primary root are called\r\n_secondary_, or _tertiary_, depending on their relation to the first root\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nDownward Growth of Root. Influence of Gravity.--Most of the roots examined\r\ntake a more or less downward direction. We are all familiar with the fact\r\nthat the force we call gravity influences life upon this earth to a great\r\ndegree. Does gravity act on the growing root? This question may be answered\r\nby a simple experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Revolve this figure in the direction of the arrows to see if\r\nthe roots of the radish respond to gravity.]\r\n\r\nPlant mustard or radish seeds in a pocket garden, place it on one edge and\r\nallow the seeds to germinate until the root has grown to a length of about\r\nhalf an inch. Then turn it at right angles to the first position and allow\r\nit to remain for one day undisturbed. The roots now will be found to have\r\nturned in response to the change in position, that part of the root near\r\nthe growing point being the most sensitive to the change. This experiment\r\nseems to indicate that the roots are influenced to grow downward by the\r\nforce of gravity.\r\n\r\nExperiments to determine the Influence of Moisture on a Growing Root.--The\r\nobjection might well be interposed that possibly the roots in the pocket\r\ngarden[8] grew downward after water. That moisture has an influence on the\r\ngrowing root is easily proved.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 8: _The Pocket Garden._--A very convenient form of\r\n     pocket germinator may be made as follows. Obtain two cleaned\r\n     four by five negatives (window glass will do); place one\r\n     flat on the table and place on this half a dozen pieces of\r\n     colored blotting paper cut to a size a little less than the\r\n     glass. Now cut four thin strips of wood to fit on the glass\r\n     just outside of the paper.  Next moisten the blotter, place\r\n     on it some well-soaked radish, mustard seeds or barley\r\n     grains, and cover with the other glass. The whole box thus\r\n     made should be bound together with bicycle tape. Seeds will\r\n     germinate in this box and with care may live for two weeks\r\n     or more.\r\n\r\nPlant bird seed, mustard or radish seed in the underside of a sponge, which\r\nshould be kept wet, and may be suspended by a string under a bell jar in\r\nthe schoolroom window. Note whether the roots leave the sponge to grow\r\ndownward, or if the moisture in the sponge is sufficient to counterbalance\r\nthe force of gravity.\r\n\r\nWater a Factor which determines the Course taken by Roots.--_Water, as well\r\nas the force of gravity, has much to do with the direction taken by roots._\r\nWater is always found below the surface of the ground, but sometimes at a\r\ngreat depth. Most trees, and all grasses, have a greater area of surface\r\nexposed by the roots than by the branches. The roots of alfalfa, a\r\ncloverlike plant used for hay in the Western states, often penetrate the\r\nsoil after water for a distance of ten to twenty feet below the surface of\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nFine Structure of a Root.[9]--When we examine a delicate root in thin\r\nlongitudinal section under the compound microscope, we find the entire root\r\nto be made up of cells, the walls of which are uniformly rather thin. Over\r\nthe lower end of the root is found a collection of cells, most of which are\r\ndead, loosely arranged so as to form a cap over the growing tip. This is\r\nevidently an adaptation which protects the young and actively growing cells\r\njust under the root cap. In the body of the root a central cylinder can\r\neasily be distinguished from the surrounding cells. In a longitudinal\r\nsection a series of tubelike structures may be found within the central\r\ncylinder. These structures are cells which have grown together at the small\r\nend, the long axis of the cells running the length of the main root. In\r\ntheir development the cells mentioned have grown together in such a manner\r\nas to lose their small ends, and now form continuous hollow tubes with\r\nrather strong walls. Other cells have come to develop greatly thickened\r\nwalls; these cells give mechanical support to the tubelike cells.\r\nCollections of such tubes and supporting woody cells together make up what\r\nare known as _fibrovascular bundles_.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 9: Sections of tradescantia roots are excellent for\r\n     demonstration of these structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cross section of a young taproot; _a_, _a_, root hairs; _b_,\r\nouter layer of bark; _c_, inner layer of bark; _d_, wood or central\r\ncylinder.]\r\n\r\nRoot Hairs.--Careful examination of the root of one of the seedlings of\r\nmustard, radish, or barley grown in the pocket germinator shows a covering\r\nof tiny fuzzy structures. These structures are very minute, at most 3 to 4\r\nmillimeters in length. They vary in length according to their position on\r\nthe root, the most and the longest root hairs being found near the point\r\nmarked _R. H._ in the figure. These structures are outgrowths of the outer\r\nlayer of the root (the _epidermis_), and are of very great importance to\r\nthe living plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Young embryo of corn, showing root hairs (_R. H._) and\r\ngrowing stem (_P._).]\r\n\r\nStructure of a Root Hair.--A single root hair examined under a compound\r\nmicroscope will be found to be a long, round structure, almost colorless in\r\nappearance. The wall, which is very flexible and thin, is made up of\r\ncellulose, a substance somewhat like wood in chemical composition, through\r\nwhich fluids may easily pass. Clinging close to the cell wall is the\r\nprotoplasm of the cell. The interior of the root hair is more or less\r\nfilled with a fluid called _cell sap_. Forming a part of the living\r\nprotoplasm of the root hair, sometimes in the hairlike prolongation and\r\nsometimes in that part of the cell which forms the epidermis, is found a\r\n_nucleus_. The protoplasm and nucleus are alive; the cell wall formed by\r\nthe living matter in the cell is dead. _The root hair is a living plant\r\ncell_ with a wall so delicate that water and mineral substances from the\r\nsoil can pass through it into the interior of the root.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of a root hair; _CS_, cell sap; _CW_, cell wall;\r\n_P_, protoplasm; _N_, nucleus; _S_, particles of soil.]\r\n\r\nHow the Root absorbs Water.--The process by which the root hair takes up\r\nsoil water can better be understood if we make an artificial root hair\r\nlarge enough to be easily seen. An egg with part of the outer shell removed\r\nso as to expose the soft skinlike membrane underneath is an example.\r\nBetter, an artificial root hair may be _made_ in the following way. Pour\r\nsome soft celloidin into a test tube; carefully revolve the test tube so\r\nthat an even film of celloidin dries on the inside. This membrane is\r\nremoved, filled with white of egg, and tied over the end of a rubber cork\r\nin which a glass tube has previously been inserted. When placed in water,\r\nit gives a very accurate picture of the root hair at work. After a short\r\ntime water begins to rise in the tube, having passed through the film of\r\ncelloidin. If grape sugar, salt, or some other substance which will\r\ndissolve in water were placed in the water outside the artificial root\r\nhair, it could soon be proved by test to pass through the wall and into the\r\nliquid inside.\r\n\r\nOsmosis.--To explain this process we must remember that gases and liquids\r\nof different densities, when separated by a membrane, tend to flow toward\r\neach other and mingle, the greater flow always being in the direction of\r\nthe denser medium. _The process by which two gases or fluids, separated by\r\na membrane, tend to pass through the membrane and mingle with each other,\r\nis called osmosis._ The method by which the root hairs take up soil water\r\nis exactly the same process. It is by osmosis. The white of the egg is the\r\nbest possible substitute for living matter; the celloidin membrane\r\nseparating the egg from the water is much like the delicate membrane-like\r\nwall which separates the protoplasm of the root hair from the water in the\r\nsoil surrounding it. The fluid in the root hair is denser than the soil\r\nwater; hence the greater flow is toward the interior of the root hair.[10]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 10: For an excellent elementary discussion of\r\n     osmosis see Moore, _Physiology of Man and Other Animals_.\r\n     Henry Holt and Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The soil particles are each surrounded with a delicate film\r\nof water. How might the root hairs take up this water?]\r\n\r\nPassage of Soil Water within the Root.--We have already seen that in an\r\nexchange of fluids by osmosis the greater flow is always toward the denser\r\nfluid. Thus it is that the root hairs take in more fluid than they give up.\r\nThe cell sap, which partly fills the interior of the root hair, is a fluid\r\nof greater density than the water outside in the soil. When the root hairs\r\nbecome filled with water, the density of the cell sap is lessened, and the\r\ncells of the epidermis are thus in a position to pass along their supply of\r\nwater to the cells next to them and nearer to the center of the root. These\r\ncells, in turn, become less dense than their inside neighbors, and so the\r\ntransfer of water goes on until the water at last reaches the central\r\ncylinder. Here it is passed over to the tubes of the woody bundles and\r\nstarted up the stem. The pressure created by this process of osmosis is\r\nsufficient to send water up the stem to a distance, in some plants, of 25\r\nto 30 feet. Cases are on record of water having been raised in the birch a\r\ndistance of 85 feet.\r\n\r\nPhysiological Importance of Osmosis.--It is not an exaggeration to say that\r\nosmosis is a process not only of great importance to a plant, but to an\r\nanimal as well. Foods are digested in the food tube of an animal; that is,\r\nthey are changed into a soluble form so that they may pass through the\r\nwalls of the food tube and become part of the blood. The inner lining of\r\npart of the food tube is thrown into millions of little fingerlike\r\nprojections which look somewhat, in size at least, like root hairs. These\r\nfingerlike processes are (unlike a root hair) made up of many cells. But\r\nthey serve the same purpose as the root hairs, for they absorb liquid food\r\ninto the blood. This process of absorption is largely by osmosis. Without\r\nthe process of osmosis we should be unable to use much of the food we eat.\r\n\r\nComposition of Soil.--If we examine a mass of ordinary loam carefully, we\r\nfind that it is composed of numerous particles of varying size and weight.\r\nBetween these particles, if the soil is not caked and hard packed, we can\r\nfind tiny spaces. In well-tilled soil these spaces are constantly being\r\nformed and enlarged. They allow air and water to penetrate the soil. If we\r\nexamine soil under the microscope, we find considerable water clinging to\r\nthe soil particles and forming a delicate film around each particle. In\r\nthis manner most of the water is held in the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inorganic soil is being formed by weathering.]\r\n\r\nHow Water is held in Soil.--To understand what comes in with the soil\r\nwater, it will be necessary to find out a little more about soil.\r\nScientists who have made the subject of the composition of the earth a\r\nstudy, tell us that once upon a time at least a part of the earth was\r\nmolten. Later, it cooled into solid rock. Soil making began when the ice\r\nand frost, working alternately with the heat, chipped off pieces of rock.\r\nThese pieces in time became ground into fragments by action of ice,\r\nglaciers, running water, or the atmosphere. This process is called\r\nweathering. Weathering is aided by oxidation. A glance at almost any\r\ncrumbling stones will convince you of this, because of the yellow oxide of\r\niron (rust) disclosed. So by slow degrees this earth became covered with a\r\ncoating of what we call inorganic soil. Later, generation after generation\r\nof tiny plants and animals which lived in the soil died, and their remains\r\nformed the first organic materials of the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This picture shows how the forests help to cover the\r\ninorganic soil with an organic coating. Explain how.]\r\n\r\nYou are all familiar with the difference between the so-called rich soil\r\nand poor soil. The dark soil contains more dead plant and animal matter,\r\nwhich forms the portion called _humus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apparatus for testing the capacity of soils to take in and\r\nretain moisture.]\r\n\r\nHumus contains Organic Matter.--It is an easy matter to prove that black\r\nsoil contains organic matter, for if an equal weight of carefully dried\r\nhumus and soil from a sandy road is heated red-hot for some time and then\r\nreweighed, the humus will be found to have lost considerably in weight, and\r\nthe sandy soil to have lost very little.  The material left after heating\r\nis inorganic material, the organic matter having been burned out.\r\n\r\nSoil containing organic materials holds water much more readily than\r\ninorganic soil, as a glance at the accompanying figure shows. If we fill\r\neach of the vessels with a given weight (say 100 grams each) of gravel,\r\nsand, barren soil, rich loam, leaf mold, and 25 grams of dry, pulverized\r\nleaves, then pour equal amounts of water (100 c.c.) on each and measure all\r\nthat runs through, the water that has been retained will represent the\r\nwater supply that plants could draw on from such soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Soil particles cling to root hairs. Why?]\r\n\r\nThe Root Hairs take more than Water out of the Soil.--If a root containing\r\na fringe of root hairs is washed carefully, it will be found to have little\r\nparticles of soil still clinging to it. Examined under the microscope,\r\nthese particles of soil seem to be cemented to the sticky surface of the\r\nroot hair. The soil contains, besides a number of chemical compounds of\r\nvarious mineral substances,--lime, potash, iron, silica, and many\r\nothers,--a considerable amount of organic material. Acids of various kinds\r\nare present in the soil. These acids so act upon certain of the mineral\r\nsubstances that they become dissolved in the water which is absorbed by the\r\nroot hairs. Root hairs also give off small amounts of acid. An interesting\r\nexperiment may be shown (see Figure on page 80) to prove this. A solution\r\nof _phenolphthalein_ loses its color when an acid is added to it. If a\r\ngrowing pea be placed in a tube containing some of this solution the latter\r\nwill quickly change from a rose pink to a colorless solution.\r\n\r\nA Plant needs Mineral Matter to Make Living Matter.--Living matter\r\n(protoplasm), besides containing the chemical elements carbon, hydrogen,\r\noxygen, and nitrogen, contains a very minute proportion of various elements\r\nwhich make up the basis of certain minerals. These are calcium (lime),\r\nsulphur, iron, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, sodium, and chlorine.\r\n\r\nThat plants will not grow well without certain of these mineral substances\r\ncan be proved by the growth of seedlings in a so-called nutrient\r\nsolution.[11] Such a solution contains all the mineral matter that a plant\r\nuses for food. If certain ingredients are left out of this solution, the\r\nplants placed in it will not live.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 11: See Hunter's _Laboratory Problems in Civic\r\n     Biology_ for list of ingredients.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of root hairs on phenolphthalein solution. The change\r\nof color indicates the presence of acid.]\r\n\r\nNitrogen in a Usable Form necessary for Growth of Plants.--A chemical\r\nelement needed by the plant to make protoplasm is nitrogen. The air can be\r\nproven by experiment to be made up of about four fifths nitrogen, but this\r\nelement cannot be taken from either soil, water, or air in a pure state,\r\nbut is usually obtained from the organic matter in the soil, where it\r\nexists with other substances in the form of _nitrates_. Ammonia and other\r\norganic compounds which contain nitrogen are changed by two groups of\r\nlittle plants called _bacteria_, first into nitrites and then nitrates.[12]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 12: It has recently been discovered that under some\r\n     conditions these bacteria are preyed upon by tiny one-celled\r\n     animals (_protozoa_) living in the soil and are so reduced\r\n     in numbers that they cannot do their work effectively. If,\r\n     then, the soil is heated artificially or treated with\r\n     antiseptics so as to kill the protozoa, the bacteria which\r\n     escape multiply so rapidly as to make the land much richer\r\n     than before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram to show how the nitrogen-fixing bacteria prepare\r\nnitrogen for use by plants; _t_, tubercles.]\r\n\r\nRelation of Bacteria to Free Nitrogen.--It has been known since the time of\r\nthe Romans that the growth of clover, peas, beans, and other legumes in\r\nsoil causes it to become more favorable for growth of other plants. The\r\nreason for this has been discovered in late years. On the roots of the\r\nplants mentioned are found little swellings or nodules; in the nodules\r\nexist millions of bacteria, which take nitrogen from the atmosphere and fix\r\nit so that it can be used by the plant; that is, they assist in forming\r\nnitrates for the plants to use. Only these bacteria, of all the living\r\nplants, have the power to take the free nitrogen from the air and make it\r\nover into a form that can be used by the roots. As all the compounds of\r\nnitrogen are used over and over again, first by plants, then as food for\r\nanimals, eventually returning to the soil again, or in part being turned\r\ninto free nitrogen, it is evident that any _new_ supply of usable nitrogen\r\nmust come by means of these nitrogen-fixing bacteria.\r\n\r\nRotation of Crops.--The facts mentioned above are made use of by careful\r\nfarmers who wish to make as much as possible from a given area of ground in\r\na given time. Such plants as are hosts for the nitrogen-fixing bacteria are\r\nplanted early in the season. Later these plants are plowed in and a second\r\ncrop is planted. The latter grows quickly and luxuriantly because of the\r\nnitrates left in the soil by the bacteria which lived with the first crop.\r\nFor this reason, clover is often grown on land in which it is proposed to\r\nplant corn, the nitrogen left in the soil thus giving nourishment to the\r\nyoung corn plants. In scientifically managed farms, different crops are\r\nplanted in a given field on different years so that one crop may replace\r\nsome of the elements taken from the soil by the previous crop. This is\r\nknown as rotation of crops.[13] The annual yield of the average farm may\r\nthus be greatly increased.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 13: That crop rotation is not primarily a process\r\n     to conserve the fertility of the soil, but is a sanitary\r\n     measure to prevent infection of the soil, is the latest\r\n     belief of the scientist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nitrogen in the soil is necessary for plants. Explain from\r\nthis diagram how nitrogen is put into the soil by some plants and taken out\r\nby others.]\r\n\r\nFive of the elements necessary to the life of the plant which may be taken\r\nout of the soil by constant use are calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus,\r\npotassium, and sulphur. Several methods are used by the farmer to prevent\r\nthe exhaustion of these and other raw food materials from the soil. One\r\nmethod known as _fallowing_ is to allow the soil to remain idle until\r\nbacteria and oxidation have renewed the chemical materials used by the\r\nplants. This is an expensive method, if land is dear. The most common\r\nmethod of enriching soil is by means of fertilizing material rich in plant\r\nfood. Manure is most frequently used, but many artificial fertilizers, most\r\nof which contain nitrogen in the form of some nitrate, are used, because\r\nthey can be more easily transported and sold. Such are ground bone, guano\r\n(bird manure), nitrate of soda, and many others. These also contain other\r\nimportant raw food materials for plants, especially potash and phosphoric\r\nacid. Both of these substances are made soluble so as to be taken into the\r\nroots by the action of the carbon dioxide in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe Indirect Relation of this to the City Dweller.--All of us living in the\r\ncity are aware of the importance of fresh vegetables, brought in from the\r\nneighboring market gardens. But we sometimes forget that our great staple\r\ncrops, wheat and other cereals, potatoes, fruits of all kinds, our cotton\r\ncrop, and all plants we make use of grow directly in proportion to the\r\namount of raw food materials they take in through the roots. When we also\r\nremember that many industries within the cities, as mills, bakeries, and\r\nthe like, as well as the earnings of our railways and steamship lines, are\r\nlargely dependent on the abundance of the crops, we may recognize the\r\nimportance of what we have read in this chapter.\r\n\r\nFood Storage in Roots of Commercial Importance.--Some plants, as the\r\nparsnip, carrot, and radish, produce no seed until the second year, storing\r\nfood in the roots the first year and using it to get an early start the\r\nfollowing spring, so as to be better able to produce seeds when the time\r\ncomes. This food storage in roots is of much practical value to mankind.\r\nMany of our commonest garden vegetables, as those mentioned above, and the\r\nbeet, turnip, oyster plant, sweet potato and many others, are of value\r\nbecause of the food stored. The sugar beet has, in Europe especially,\r\nbecome the basis of a great industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

PLANT GROWTH AND NUTRITION--PLANTS MAKE FOOD\r\n\r\n_Problem.--Where, when, and how do green plants make food?_\r\n         _(a) How and why is moisture given off from leaves?_\r\n         _(b) What is the reaction of leaves to light?_\r\n         _(c) What is made in green leaves in the sunlight?_\r\n         _(d) What by-products are given off in the above process?_\r\n         _(e) Other functions of leaves._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Demonstration._--Water given off by plant in sunlight. Loss\r\n       of weight due to transpiration measured.\r\n     _Laboratory exercise._--\r\n       (_a_) Gross structure of a leaf.\r\n       (_b_) Study of stoma and lower epidermis under microscope.\r\n       (_c_) Study of cross section to show cells and air spaces.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Reaction of leaves to light.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Light necessary to starch making.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Air necessary to starch making.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Oxygen a by-product of starch making.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the Water taken in by the Roots?--We have seen that more\r\nthan pure water has been absorbed through the root hairs into the roots.\r\nWhat becomes of this water and the other substances that have been\r\nabsorbed? This question may be partly answered by the following\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apple twigs split to show the course of colored water up the\r\nstem.]\r\n\r\nPassage of Fluids up the Stem.--If any young growing shoots (young\r\nseedlings of corn or pea, or the older stems of garden balsam,\r\ntouch-me-not, or sunflower) are placed in red ink (eosin), and left in the\r\nsun for a few hours, the red ink will be found to have passed up the stem.\r\nIf such stems were examined carefully, it would be seen that the colored\r\nfluid is confined to collections of woody tubes immediately under the inner\r\nbark. Water evidently rises in that part of the stem we call the wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment to prove that water is given off through the\r\nleaves of a green plant.]\r\n\r\nWater given off by Evaporation from Leaves.--Take some well-watered potted\r\ngreen plant, as a geranium or hydrangea, cover the pot with sheet rubber,\r\nfastening the rubber close to the stem of the plant. Next weigh the plant\r\nwith the pot. Then cover it with a tall bell jar and place the apparatus in\r\nthe sun. In a few minutes drops of moisture are seen to gather on the\r\n_inside_ of the jar. If we now weigh the potted plant, we find it weighs\r\nless than before. Obviously the loss comes from the water lost, and\r\nevidently this water escapes as vapor from either the stem or leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The skeleton of a leaf. _M.R._, the midrib; _P._, the\r\nleafstalk; _V._, the veins.]\r\n\r\nThe Structure of a Leaf.--In the experiment with the red ink mentioned\r\nabove we will find that the fluid has gone out into the skeleton or\r\nframework of the leaf. Let us now examine a leaf more carefully. It shows\r\nusually (1) a flat, broad _blade_, which may take almost any conceivable\r\nshape; (2) a _stem_ which spreads out in the blade (3) in a number of\r\n_veins_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section through the blade of a leaf as seen under the\r\ncompound microscope. _S_, air spaces, which communicate with the outside\r\nair; _V_, vein in cross section; _S.T._, breathing hole (stoma); _E_, outer\r\nlayer of cells; _P_, green cells.]\r\n\r\nThe Cell Structure of a Leaf.--The under surface of a leaf seen under the\r\nmicroscope usually shows numbers of tiny oval openings. These are called\r\n_stomata_ (singular _stoma_). Two cells, usually kidney-shaped, are found,\r\none on each side of the opening. These are the _guard cells_. By change in\r\nshape of these cells the opening of the stoma is made larger or smaller.\r\nLarger irregular cells form the _epidermis_, or outer covering of the leaf.\r\nStudy of the leaf in cross section shows that these stomata open directly\r\ninto air chambers which penetrate between and around the loosely arranged\r\ncells composing the underpart of the leaf. The upper surface of leaves\r\nsometimes contains stomata, but more often they are lacking. The under\r\nsurface of an oak leaf of ordinary size contains about 2,000,000 stomata.\r\nUnder the upper epidermis is a layer of green cells closely packed together\r\n(called collectively the _palisade layer_). These cells are more or less\r\ncolumnar in shape. Under these are several rows of rather loosely placed\r\ncells just mentioned. These are called collectively the _spongy tissue_. If\r\nwe happen to have a section cut through a vein, we find this composed of a\r\nnumber of tubes made up of, and strengthened by, thick-walled cells. The\r\nveins are evidently a continuation of the tubes of the stem out into the\r\nblade of the leaf.\r\n\r\nEvaporation of Water.--During the day an enormous amount of water is taken\r\nup by the roots and passed out through the leaves. So great is this excess\r\nat times that a small grass plant on a summer's day evaporates more than\r\nits own weight in water. This would make nearly half a ton of water\r\ndelivered to the air during twenty-four hours by a grass plot twenty-five\r\nby one hundred feet, the size of the average city lot. According to Ward,\r\nan oak tree may pass off two hundred and twenty-six times its own weight in\r\nwater during the season from June to October.\r\n\r\nFrom which Surface of the Leaf is Water Lost?--In order to find out whether\r\nwater is passed out from any particular part of the leaf, we may remove two\r\nleaves of the same size and weight from some large-leaved plant[14]--a\r\nmullein was used for the illustrations given below--and cover the upper\r\nsurface of one leaf and the lower surface of the other with vaseline. The\r\nleaf stalks of each should be covered with wax or vaseline, and the two\r\nleaves exactly balanced on the pans of a balance which has previously been\r\nplaced in a warm and sunny place. Within an hour the leaf which has the\r\nupper surface covered with vaseline will show a loss of weight. Examination\r\nof the surface of a mullein leaf shows us that the _lower surface of the\r\nleaf is provided with stomata_. It is through these organs, then, that\r\nwater is passed out from the tissues of the leaf.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 14: The \"rubber plant\" leaf is an easily obtainable\r\n     and excellent demonstration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment to show through which surface of a leaf water\r\npasses off.]\r\n\r\nFactors in Transpiration.--The amount of water lost from a plant varies\r\ngreatly under different conditions. The humidity of the air, its\r\ntemperature, and the temperature of the plant all affect the rate of\r\ntranspiration. The stomata also tend to close under some conditions, thus\r\nhelping to prevent evaporation. But there seems to be no certain regulation\r\nof this water loss. Consequently plants droop or wilt on hot dry days\r\nbecause they cannot obtain water rapidly enough from the soil to make up\r\nfor the loss through the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagrams of a stoma. _a_, surface view of a closed stoma;\r\n_b_, the same stoma opened. (After Hanson.) _c_, diagrams of a transverse\r\nsection through a stoma, dotted lines indicate the closed position of the\r\nguard cells, the heavy lines the open condition. (After Schwendener.)]\r\n\r\nGreen Plants Food Makers.--We have previously stated that green plants are\r\nthe great food makers for themselves and for animals. We are now ready to\r\nattack the problem of how green plants _make_ food.\r\n\r\nThe Sun a Source of Energy.--We all know the sun is a source of most of the\r\nenergy that is released on this earth in the form of heat or light. Every\r\nboy knows the power of a \"burning glass.\" Solar engines have not come into\r\nany great use as yet, because fuel is cheaper, but some day we undoubtedly\r\nwill directly harness the energy of the sun in everyday work. Actual\r\nexperiments have shown that vast amounts of energy are given to the earth.\r\nWhen the sun is highest in the sky, energy equivalent to one hundred horse\r\npower is received by a plot of land twenty-five by one hundred feet, the\r\nsize of a city lot. Plants receive and use much of this energy by means of\r\ntheir leaves.\r\n\r\nEffect of Light on Plants.--In young plants which have been grown in total\r\ndarkness, no green color is found in either stems or leaves, the latter\r\noften being reduced to mere scales. The stems are long and more or less\r\nreclining. We can explain the changed condition of the seedling grown in\r\nthe dark only by assuming that light has some effect on the protoplasm of\r\nthe seedling and induces the growth of the green part of the plant. If\r\nseedlings have been growing on a window sill, or where the light comes in\r\nfrom one side, you have doubtless noticed that the stem and leaves of the\r\nseedlings incline in the direction from which the light comes. The\r\nexperiment pictured shows this effect of light very plainly. A hole was cut\r\nin one end of a cigar box and barriers were erected in the interior of the\r\nbox so that the seeds planted in the sawdust received their light by an\r\nindirect course. The young seedling in this case responded to the influence\r\nof the stimulus of light so as to grow out finally through the hole in the\r\nbox into the open air. This growth of the stem to the light is of very\r\ngreat importance to a growing plant, because, as we shall see later, food\r\nmaking depends largely on the amount of sunlight the leaves receive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two stages in an experiment to show that green plants grow\r\ntoward the light.]\r\n\r\nEffect of Light on Leaf Arrangement.--It is a matter of common knowledge\r\nthat green leaves turn toward the light. Place growing pea seedlings,\r\noxalis, or any other plants of rapid growth near a window which receives\r\nfull sunlight. Within a short time the leaves are found to be in positions\r\nto receive the most sunlight possible. Careful observation of any plant\r\ngrowing outdoors shows us that in almost every case the leaves are so\r\ndisposed as to get much sunlight. The ivy climbing up the wall, the\r\nmorning-glory, the dandelion, and the burdock all show different\r\narrangements of leaves, each presenting a large surface to the light.\r\nLeaves are often definitely arranged, fitting in between one another so as\r\nto present their upper surface to the sun. Such an arrangement is known as\r\na _leaf mosaic_. In the case of the dandelion, a _rosette_ or whorled\r\ncluster of leaves is found. In the horse-chestnut, where the leaves come\r\nout opposite each other, the older leaves have longer petioles than the\r\nyoung ones. In the mullein the entire plant forms a cone. The old leaves\r\nnear the bottom have long stalks, and the little ones near the apex come\r\nout close to the main stalk. In every case each leaf receives a large\r\namount of light. Other modifications of these forms may easily be found on\r\nany field trip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A lily, showing long narrow leaves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The dandelion, showing a whorled arrangement of long\r\nirregular leaves.]\r\n\r\nStarch made by a Green Leaf.--If we examine the palisade layer of the leaf,\r\nwe find cells which are almost cylindrical in form. In the protoplasm of\r\nsuch cells are found a number of little green-colored bodies, which are\r\nknown as _chloroplasts_ or _chlorophyll bodies_. If we place the leaf in\r\nwood alcohol, we find that the bodies still remain, but that the color is\r\nextracted, going into the alcohol and giving to it a beautiful green color.\r\nThe chloroplasts are, indeed, simply part of the protoplasm of the cell\r\ncolored green. These bodies are of the greatest importance directly to\r\nplants and indirectly to animals. _The chloroplasts, by means of the energy\r\nreceived from the sun, manufacture starch out of certain raw materials._\r\nThese raw materials are soil water, which is passed up through the bundles\r\nof tubes into the veins of the leaf from the roots, and carbon dioxide,\r\nwhich is taken in through the stomata or pores, which dot the under surface\r\nof the leaf. A plant with variegated leaves, as the coleus, makes starch\r\nonly in the green part of the leaf, even though these raw materials reach\r\nall parts of the leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An experiment to show the effect of excluding light (but not\r\nair) from the leaves of a green plant. The result of this experiment is\r\nseen in the next picture. (Experiment performed by C. Dobbins and A.\r\nSchwartz.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Starchless area in a leaf caused by excluding sunlight by\r\nmeans of a strip of black cloth.]\r\n\r\nLight and Air necessary for Starch Making.--If we pin strips of black\r\ncloth, such as alpaca, over some of the leaves of a growing hydrangea which\r\nhas previously been placed in a dark room for a few hours, and then put the\r\nplant in direct sunlight for an hour or two, we are ready to test for\r\nstarch. We then remove some of the covered leaves and extract the\r\nchlorophyll with wood alcohol (because the green color of the chlorophyll\r\ninterferes with the blue color of the starch test). A test then shows that\r\nstarch is present only in the portions of the leaves exposed to sunlight.\r\nFrom this experiment we infer that the sun has something to do with starch\r\nmaking in a leaf. The necessity of a part of the air (carbon dioxide) for\r\nstarch making may also easily be proved, for the parts of leaves covered\r\nwith vaseline will be found to contain no starch, while parts of the leaf\r\nwithout vaseline, but exposed to the sun and air, do contain starch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram to show starch making. Read the text carefully and\r\nthen explain this diagram.]\r\n\r\nAir is necessary for the process of starch making in a leaf, not only\r\nbecause carbon dioxide gas is absorbed (there are from three to four parts\r\nin ten thousand present in the atmosphere), but also because the leaf is\r\nalive and must have oxygen in order to do work. This oxygen it takes from\r\nthe air around it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram to illustrate the formation of starch in a leaf.]\r\n\r\nComparison of Starch Making and Milling.--The manufacture of starch by the\r\ngreen leaf is not easily understood. The process has been compared to the\r\nmilling of grain. In this case the mill is the green part of the leaf. The\r\nsun furnishes the motive power, the chloroplasts constitute the machinery,\r\nand soil water and carbon dioxide are the raw products taken into the mill.\r\nThe manufactured product is starch, and a certain by-product (corresponding\r\nto the waste in a mill) is also given out. This by-product is oxygen. To\r\nunderstand the process fully, we must refer to a small portion of the leaf\r\nshown below. Here we find that the cells of the green layer of the leaf,\r\nunder the upper epidermis, perform most of the work. The carbon dioxide is\r\ntaken in through the stomata and reaches the green cells by way of the\r\nintercellular spaces and by osmosis from cell to cell. Water reaches the\r\ngreen cells through the veins. It then passes into the cells by osmosis,\r\nand there becomes part of the cell sap. The light of the sun easily\r\npenetrates to the cells of the palisade layer, giving the energy needed to\r\nmake the starch. This whole process is a very delicate one, and will take\r\nplace only when external conditions are favorable. For example, too much\r\nheat or too little heat stops starch making in the leaf. This building up\r\nof food and the release of oxygen by the plant in the presence of sunlight\r\nis called _photosynthesis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram (after Stevens) to illustrate the processes of\r\nbreathing and food making in the cells of a green leaf in the sunlight.]\r\n\r\nManufacture of Fats.--Inasmuch as tiny droplets of oil are found _inside_\r\nthe chlorophyll bodies in the leaf, we believe that fats, too, are made\r\nthere, probably by a transformation of the starch already manufactured.\r\n\r\nProtein Making and its Relation to the Making of Living Matter.--Protein\r\nmaterial is a food which is necessary to form protoplasm. Protein food is\r\npresent in the leaf, and is found in the stem or root as well. Proteins can\r\napparently be manufactured in any of the cells of green plants, the\r\npresence of light not seeming to be a necessary factor. How it is\r\nmanufactured is a matter of conjecture. The minerals brought up in the soil\r\nwater form part of its composition, and starch or grape sugar give three\r\nelements (C, H, and O). The element nitrogen is taken up by the roots as a\r\nnitrate (nitrogen in combination with lime or potash). Proteins are\r\nprobably not made directly into protoplasm in the leaf, but are stored by\r\nthe cells of the plant and used when needed, either to form new cells in\r\ngrowth or to repair waste. While plants and animals obtain their food in\r\ndifferent ways, they probably make it into living substance (_assimilate_\r\nit) in exactly the same manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An example of how a tree may exert energy. This rock has\r\nbeen split by the growing tree.]\r\n\r\nFoods serve exactly the same purposes in plants and in animals; they either\r\nbuild living matter or they are burned (oxidized) to furnish energy (power\r\nto do work). If you doubt that a plant exerts energy, note how the roots of\r\na tree bore their way through the hardest soil, and how stems or roots of\r\ntrees often split open the hardest rocks, as illustrated in the figure\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nStarch-Making and its Relation to Human Welfare.--Leaves which have been in\r\ndarkness show starch to be present soon after exposure to light. A corn\r\nplant sends 10 to 15 grams of reserve material into the ears in a single\r\nday. The formation of fruit, and especially the growth of the grain fields,\r\nshow the economic importance of this fact. Not only do plants make their\r\nown food and store it away, but they make food for animals as well. And the\r\nfood is stored in such a stable form that it may be sent to all parts of\r\nthe world in the form of grain or other fruits. Animals, herbivorous and\r\nflesh-eating, man himself, all are dependent upon the starch-making\r\nprocesses of the green plant for the ultimate source of their food. When we\r\nremember that in 1913 in the United States the total value of all farm\r\ncrops was over $6,000,000,000, and when we realize that these products came\r\nfrom the air and soil through the energy of the sun, we may begin to\r\nrealize why as city boys and girls the study of plant biology is of\r\nimportance to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment to show that oxygen is given off by green plants\r\nin the sunlight.]\r\n\r\nGreen Plants give off Oxygen in Sunlight.--In still another way green\r\nplants are of direct use to us in the city. During this process of\r\nstarch-making oxygen is given off as a by-product. This may easily be\r\nproven by the following experiment.[15] Place any green water plant in a\r\nbattery jar partly filled with water, cover the plants with a glass funnel\r\nand mount a test tube full of water over the mouth of the funnel. Then\r\nplace the apparatus in a warm sunny window. Bubbles of gas are seen to rise\r\nfrom the plant. After two or three hours of hot sun, enough of the gas can\r\nbe obtained by displacement of the water to make the oxygen test.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 15: Immediate success with this experiment will be\r\n     obtained if the water has been previously charged with\r\n     carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nThat oxygen is given off as a by-product by green plants is a fact of\r\nfar-reaching importance. City parks are true \"breathing spaces.\" The green\r\ncovering of the earth is giving to animals an element that they must have,\r\nwhile the animals in their turn are supplying to the plants carbon dioxide,\r\na compound used in food-making. Thus a widespread relation of mutual\r\nhelpfulness exists between plants and animals.\r\n\r\nRespiration by Leaves.--All living things require oxygen. It is by means of\r\nthe oxidation of food materials within the plant's body that the energy\r\nused in growth and movement is released. A plant takes in oxygen largely\r\nthrough the stomata of the leaves, to a less extent through the _lenticels_\r\nor breathing holes in the stem, and through the roots. Thus rapidly growing\r\ntissues receive the oxygen necessary for them to perform their work. The\r\nproducts of oxidation in the form of carbon dioxide are also passed off\r\nthrough these same organs. It can be shown by experiment that a plant uses\r\nup oxygen in the darkness; in the light the amount of oxygen given off as a\r\nby-product in the process of starch-making is, of course, much greater than\r\nthe amount used by the plant.\r\n\r\nSummary.--From the above paragraphs it is seen that a leaf performs the\r\nfollowing functions: (1) breathing, or the taking in of oxygen and passing\r\noff of carbon dioxide; (2) starch-making, with the incidental passing out\r\nof oxygen; (3) formation of proteins, with their digestion and assimilation\r\nto form new tissues; and (4) the transpiration of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

PLANT GROWTH AND NUTRITION--THE CIRCULATION AND FINAL USES OF FOOD BY\r\nPLANTS\r\n\r\n_Problem.--How green plants store and use the food they make._\r\n         _(a) What are the organs of circulation?_\r\n         _(b) How and where does food circulate?_\r\n         _(c) How does the plant assimilate its food?_\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Laboratory exercise._--The structure (cross section) of a\r\n       woody stem.\r\n     _Demonstration._--To show that food passes downward in the\r\n       bark.\r\n     _Demonstration._--To show the condition of food passing\r\n       through the stem.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Plants with special digestive organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Circulation and Final Uses of Foods in Green Plants.--We have seen that\r\ncells of green plants make food and that such cells are mostly in the\r\nleaves. But _all_ parts of the bodies of plants grow. Roots, stems, leaves,\r\nflowers, and fruits grow. Seeds are storehouses of food. We must now\r\nexamine the stem of some plant in order to see how food is distributed,\r\nstored, and finally used in the various parts of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe Structure of a Woody Stem.--If we cut a cross section through a young\r\nwillow or apple stem, we find it shows three distinct regions. The center\r\nis occupied by the spongy, soft _pith_; surrounding this is found the\r\nrather tough _wood_, while the outermost area is _bark_. More careful study\r\nof the bark reveals the presence of three layers--an outer layer, a middle\r\ngreen layer, and an inner fibrous layer, the latter usually brown in color.\r\nThis layer is made up largely of tough fiberlike cells known as _bast_\r\nfibers. The most important parts of this inner bark, so far as the plant is\r\nconcerned, are many tubelike structures known as _sieve tubes_. These are\r\nlong rows of living cells, having perforated sievelike ends. Through these\r\ncells food materials pass downward from the upper part of the plant, where\r\nthey are manufactured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of a twig of box elder three years old, showing\r\nthree annual growth rings. The radiating lines (_m_) which cross the wood\r\n(_w_) represent the pith rays, the principal ones extending from the pith\r\nin the center to the cortex or bark. (From Coulter's _Plant Relations_.)]\r\n\r\nIn the wood will be noticed (see Figure) a number of lines radiating\r\noutward from the pith toward the bark. These are thin plates of pith which\r\nseparate the wood into a number of wedge-shaped masses. These masses of\r\nwood are composed of many elongated cells, which, placed end to end, form\r\nthousands of little tubes connecting the leaves with the roots. In addition\r\nto these are many thick-walled cells, which give strength to the mass of\r\nwood. The bundles of tubes with their surrounding hard walled cells are the\r\ncontinuation of the bundles of tubes which are found in the root. In\r\nsections of wood which have taken several years to grow, we find so-called\r\n_annual rings_. The distance between one ring and the next (see Figure)\r\nusually represents the amount of growth in one year. Growth takes place\r\nfrom an actively dividing layer of cells, known as the _cambium layer_.\r\nThis layer forms wood cells from its inner surface and bark from its outer\r\nsurface. Thus new wood is formed as a distinct ring around the old wood.\r\n\r\nUse of the Outer Bark.--The outer bark of a tree is protective. The cells\r\nare dead, the heavy woody skeletons serving to keep out cold and dryness,\r\nas well as prevent the evaporation of fluids from within. The bark also\r\nprotects the tree from attack of other plants or animals which might harm\r\nit. Most trees are provided with a layer of corky cells. This layer in the\r\ncork oak is thick enough to be of commercial importance. The function of\r\nthe corky layer in preventing evaporation is well seen in the case of the\r\npotato, which is a true stem, though found underground. If two potatoes of\r\nequal weight are balanced on the scales, the skin having been peeled from\r\none, the peeled potato will be found to lose weight rapidly. This is due to\r\nloss of water, which is held in by the skin of the unpeeled potato (see\r\nright hand figure below).\r\n\r\nThere are also small breathing holes known as _lenticels_ scattered through\r\nthe surface of the bark. These can easily be seen in a young woody stem of\r\napple, beech, or horse-chestnut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment to show that the skin of the potato (a stem)\r\nretards evaporation.]\r\n\r\nProof that Food passes down the Stem.--If freshly cut willow twigs are\r\nplaced in water, roots soon begin to develop from that part of the stem\r\nwhich is under water. If now the stem is girdled by removing the bark in a\r\nring just above where the roots are growing, the latter will eventually\r\ndie, and new roots will appear above the girdled area. The food material\r\nnecessary for the outgrowth of roots evidently comes from above, and the\r\npassage of food materials takes place in a downward direction just outside\r\nthe wood in the layer of bark which contains the bast fibers and sieve\r\ntubes. This experiment with the willow explains why it is that trees die\r\nwhen girdled so as to cut the sieve tubes of the inner bark. The food\r\nsupply is cut off from the protoplasm of the cells in the part of the tree\r\nbelow the cut area. Many of the canoe birches of our Adirondack forest are\r\nthus killed, girdled by thoughtless visitors. In the same manner mice and\r\nother gnawing animals kill fruit trees. Food substances are also conducted\r\nto a much less extent in the wood itself, and food passes from the inner\r\nbark to the center of the tree by way of the pith plates. This can be\r\nproved by testing for starch in the pith plates of young stems. It is found\r\nthat much starch is stored in this part of the tree trunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment to show that food material passes down in the\r\ninner bark.]\r\n\r\nIn what Form does Food pass through the Stem?--We have already seen that\r\nmaterials in solution (those substances which will dissolve in the water)\r\nwill pass from cell to cell by the process of osmosis. This is shown in the\r\nexperiment illustrated in the figure. Two thistle tubes are partly filled,\r\none with starch and water, the other with sugar and water, and a piece of\r\nparchment paper is tied over the end of each. The lower ends of both tubes\r\nare placed in a glass dish under water. After twenty-four hours, the water\r\nin the dish is tested for starch, and then for sugar. We find that only the\r\nsugar, which has been dissolved by the water, can pass through the\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment to show osmosis of sugar (right hand tube) and\r\nnon-osmosis of starch (left hand tube).]\r\n\r\nDigestion.--Much of the food made in the leaves is stored in the form of\r\nstarch. But starch, being insoluble, cannot be passed from cell to cell in\r\na plant. It must be changed to a soluble form, for otherwise it could not\r\npass through the delicate cell membranes. This is accomplished by the\r\nprocess of _digestion_. We have already seen that starch is changed to\r\ngrape sugar in the corn by the action of a substance (an enzyme) called\r\n_diastase_. This process of digestion seemingly may take place in all\r\nliving parts of the plant, although most of it is done in the leaves. In\r\nthe bodies of all animals, including man, starchy foods are changed in a\r\nsimilar manner, but by other enzymes, into soluble grape sugar.\r\n\r\nThe food material may be passed in a soluble form until it comes to a place\r\nwhere food storage is to take place, then it can be transformed to an\r\ninsoluble form (starch, for example); later, when needed by the plant in\r\ngrowth, it may again be transformed and sent in a soluble form through the\r\nstem to the place where it will be used.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, protein seems to be changed and transferred to various\r\nparts of the plant. Some forms of protein substance are _soluble_ and\r\nothers _insoluble_ in water. White of egg, for example, is slightly\r\nsoluble, but can be rendered insoluble by heating it so that it coagulates.\r\nInsoluble proteins are digested within the plant; how and where is but\r\nslightly understood. In a plant, soluble proteins pass down the sieve tubes\r\nin the bast and then may be stored in the bast or medullary rays of the\r\nwood in an insoluble form, or they may pass into the fruit or seeds of a\r\nplant, and be stored there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram to show the areas in a plant through which the raw\r\nfood materials pass up the stem and food materials pass down.]\r\n\r\nWhat forces Water up the Stem.--We have seen that the process of osmosis is\r\nresponsible for taking in soil water, and that the enormous absorbing\r\nsurface exposed by the root hairs makes possible the absorption of a large\r\namount of water. Frequently this is more than the weight of the plant in\r\nevery twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made which show that at certain times in the year\r\nthis water is in some way forced up the tiny tubes of the stem. During the\r\nspring season, in young and rapidly growing trees, water has been proved to\r\nrise to a height of nearly ninety feet. The force that causes this rise of\r\nwater in stems is known as _root pressure_.\r\n\r\nThe greatest factor, however, is transpiration of water from leaves. This\r\nevaporation of water in the form of vapor seems to result in a kind of\r\nsuction on the column of water in the stem. In the fall, after the leaves\r\nhave gone, much less water is taken in by roots, showing that an intimate\r\nrelation exists between the leaves and the root.\r\n\r\nSummary of the Functions of Green Plants.--The processes which we have just\r\ndescribed (with the exception of food making) are those which occur in the\r\nlives of any plant or animal. All plants and animals breathe, they oxidize\r\ntheir foods to release energy, carbon dioxide being given off as the result\r\nof the union of the carbon in the foods with the oxygen of the air. Both\r\nplants and animals digest their food; plants may do this in the cells of\r\nthe root, stem, and leaf. Digestion must always occur so that food can be\r\nmoved in a soluble condition from cell to cell in the plant's body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leaf of sundew closing over a captured insect.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Venus fly trap, showing open and closed leaves.]\r\n\r\nPlants with Special Digestive Organs.--Some plants have special organs of\r\ndigestion. One of these, the sundew, has leaves which are covered on one\r\nside with tiny glandular hairs. These attract insects and later serve to\r\ncatch and digest the nitrogenous matter of these insects by means of\r\nenzymes poured out by the same hairs. Another plant, the Venus fly trap,\r\ncatches insects in a sensitive leaf which folds up and holds the insect\r\nfast until enzymes poured out by the leaf slowly digest it. Still others,\r\ncalled pitcher plants, use as food the decayed bodies of insects which fall\r\ninto their cuplike leaves and die there. In this respect plants are like\r\nthose animals which have certain organs in the body set apart for the\r\ndigestion of food.\r\n\r\nAssimilation.--The assimilation of foods, or making of foods into living\r\nmatter, is a process we know very little about. We know it takes place in\r\nthe living cells of plants and animals. But how foods are changed into\r\nliving matter is one of the mysteries of life which we have not yet solved.\r\n\r\nExcretion.--The waste and repair of living matter seems to take place in\r\nboth plants and animals. When living plants breathe, they give off carbon\r\ndioxide. In the process of starch-making, oxygen might be considered the\r\nwaste product. Water is evaporated from leaves and stems. The leaves fall\r\nand carry away waste mineral substances which they contain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The embryos of (_a_) the morning glory, (_b_) the barberry,\r\n(_c_) the potato, (_d_) the four o'clock, showing the position of their\r\nfood supply. (After Gray.)]\r\n\r\nReproduction.--Finally, both plants and animals have organs of\r\nreproduction. We have seen that the flower gives rise, after pollination,\r\nto a fruit which holds the seeds. These seeds hold the _embryo_. Thus the\r\nyoung plant is doubly protected for a time and is finally thrown off in the\r\nseed with enough food to give it a start in life. In much the same way we\r\nwill find that animals reproduce, either by laying eggs which contain an\r\n_embryo_ and food to start it in life or, as in the higher animals, by\r\nholding and protecting the embryo within the body of the mother until it is\r\nborn, a helpless little creature, to be tenderly nourished by the mother\r\nuntil able to care for itself.\r\n\r\nThe Life Cycle.--Ultimately both plants and animals grow old and die. Some\r\nplants, for example the pea or bean, live but a season; others, such as the\r\nbig trees of California, live for hundreds of years. Some insects exist as\r\nadults but a day, while the elephant is said to live almost two hundred\r\nyears. The span of life from the time the plant or animal begins to grow\r\nuntil it dies is known as the _life cycle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

The devastation of immense areas in China and considerable damage\r\nby floods in parts of Switzerland, France, and in Pennsylvania has resulted\r\nwhere the forest covering has been removed. No one who has tramped through\r\nour Adirondack forest can escape noticing the differences in the condition\r\nof streams surrounded by forest and those which flow through areas from\r\nwhich trees have been cut. The latter streams often dry up entirely in hot\r\nweather, while the forest-shaded stream has a never failing supply of\r\ncrystal water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Working to prevent erosion after the removal of the forest\r\nin the French Alps.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Erosion at Sayre, Pennsylvania, by the Chemung River.\r\n(Photograph by W. C. Barbour.)]\r\n\r\nThe city of New York owes much of its importance to its position at the\r\nmouth of a great river with a harbor large enough to float the navies of\r\nthe world. This river is supplied with water largely from the Adirondack\r\nand Catskill forests. Should these forests be destroyed, it is not\r\nimpossible that the frequent freshets which would follow would so fill the\r\nHudson River with silt and debris that the ship channels in the bay,\r\nalready costing the government hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to\r\nkeep dredged, would become too shallow for ships. If this _should_ occur,\r\nthe greatest city in this country would soon lose its place and become of\r\nsecond-rate importance.\r\n\r\nThe story of how this very thing happened to the old Greek\r\ncity of Poseidonia is graphically told in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was such a strange, tremendous story, that of the Greek\r\n     Poseidonia, later the Roman Paestum. Long ago those\r\n     adventuring mariners from Greece had seized the fertile\r\n     plain, which at that time was covered with forests of great\r\n     oak and watered by two clear and shining rivers. They drove\r\n     the Italian natives back into the distant hills, for the\r\n     white man's burden even then included the taking of all the\r\n     desirable things that were being wasted by incompetent\r\n     natives, and they brought over colonists--whom the\r\n     philosophers and moralists at home maligned, no doubt, in\r\n     the same pleasant fashion of our own day. And the colonists\r\n     cut down the oaks, and plowed the land, and built cities,\r\n     and made harbors, and finally dusted their busy hands and\r\n     busy souls of the grime of labor and wrought splendid\r\n     temples in honor of the benign gods who had given them the\r\n     possessions of the Italians and filled them with power and\r\n     fatness.\r\n\r\n     \"Every once in so often the natives looked lustfully down\r\n     from the hills upon this fatness, made an armed snatch at\r\n     it, were driven back with bloody contumely, and the heaping\r\n     of riches upon riches went on. And more and more the oaks\r\n     were cut down--mark that! for the stories of nations are so\r\n     inextricably bound up with the stories of trees--until all\r\n     the plain was cleared and tilled; and then the foothills\r\n     were denuded, and the wave of destruction crept up the\r\n     mountain sides, and they, too, were left naked to the sun\r\n     and the rains.\r\n\r\n     \"At first these rains, sweeping down torrentially,\r\n     unhindered by the lost forests, only enriched the plain with\r\n     the long-hoarded sweetness of the trees; but by and by the\r\n     living rivers grew heavy and thick, vomiting mud into the\r\n     ever shallowing harbors, and the land soured with the\r\n     undrained stagnant water. Commerce turned more and more to\r\n     deeper ports, and mosquitoes began to breed in the brackish\r\n     soil that was making fast between the city and the sea.\r\n\r\n     \"Who of all those powerful landowners and rich merchants\r\n     could ever have dreamed that little buzzing insects could\r\n     sting a great city to death? But they did. Fevers grew more\r\n     and more prevalent. The malaria haunted population went more\r\n     and more languidly about their business. The natives, hardy\r\n     and vigorous in the hills, were but feebly repulsed.\r\n     Carthage demanded tribute, and Rome took it, and changed the\r\n     city's name from Poseidonia to Paestum. After Rome grew weak,\r\n     Saracen corsairs came in by sea and grasped the slackly\r\n     defended riches, and the little winged poisoners of the\r\n     night struck again and again, until grass grew in the\r\n     streets, and the wharves crumbled where they stood. Finally,\r\n     the wretched remnant of a great people wandered away into\r\n     the more wholesome hills, the marshes rotted in the heat and\r\n     grew up in coarse reeds where corn and vine had flourished,\r\n     and the city melted back into the wasted earth.\"[16]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 16: Elizabeth Bisland and Anne Hoyt, _Seekers in\r\n     Sicily_. John Lane Company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Result of deforestation in China. This land has been ruined\r\nby erosion. (Carnegie Institution Research in China.)]\r\n\r\nPrevention of Erosion by Covering of Organic Soil.--We have shown how\r\nungoverned streams might dig out soil and carry it far from its original\r\nsource. Examples of what streams have done may be seen in the deltas formed\r\nat the mouths of great rivers. The forest prevents this by holding the\r\nwater supply and letting it out gradually. This it does by covering the\r\ninorganic soil with humus or decayed organic material. In this way the\r\nforest floor becomes like a sponge, holding water through long periods of\r\ndrought. The roots of the trees, too, help hold the soil in place. The\r\ngradual evaporation of water through the stomata of the leaves cools the\r\natmosphere, and this tends to precipitate the moisture in the air.\r\nEventually the dead bodies of the trees themselves are added to the organic\r\ncovering, and new trees take their place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The forest regions of the United States.]\r\n\r\nOther Uses of the Forest.--In some localities forests are used as\r\nwindbreaks and to protect mountain towns against avalanches. In winter they\r\nmoderate the cold, and in summer reduce the heat and lessen the danger from\r\nstorms. Birds nesting in the woods protect many valuable plants which\r\notherwise might be destroyed by insects.\r\n\r\nForests have great commercial importance. Pyrogallic and other acids are\r\nobtained from trees, as are tar, creosote, resin, turpentine, and many\r\nuseful oils. The making of maple sirup and sugar forms a profitable\r\nindustry in several states.\r\n\r\nThe Forest Regions of the United States.--The combined area of all the\r\nforests in the United States, exclusive of Alaska, is about 500,000,000\r\nacres. This seemingly immense area is rapidly decreasing in acreage and in\r\nquality, thanks to the demands of an increasing population, a woeful\r\nignorance on the part of the owners of the land, and wastefulness on the\r\npart of cutters and users alike.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map on page 109 shows the distribution of our principal\r\nforests. Washington ranks first in the production of lumber. Here the great\r\nDouglas fir, one of the \"evergreens,\" forms the chief source of supply. In\r\nthe Southern states, especially Louisiana and Mississippi, yellow pine and\r\ncypress are the trees most lumbered.\r\n\r\nWhich states produce the most hardwoods? From which states do we get most\r\nof our yellow pine, spruce, red fir, redwood? Where are the heaviest\r\nforests of the United States?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transportation of lumber in the West. A logging train.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transportation of lumber in the East. Logs are mostly\r\nfloated down rivers to the mills.]\r\n\r\nUses of Wood.--Even in this day of coal, wood is still by far the most used\r\nfuel. It is useful in building. It outlasts iron under water, in addition\r\nto being durable and light. It is cheap and, with care of the forests,\r\ninexhaustible, while our mineral wealth may some day be used up. Distilled\r\nwood gives wood alcohol. Partially burned wood is charcoal. In our forests\r\nmuch of the soft wood (the cone-bearing trees, spruce, balsam, hemlock, and\r\npine), and poplars, aspens, basswood, with some other species, make paper\r\npulp. The daily newspaper and cheap books are responsible for inroads on\r\nour forests which cannot well be repaired. It is not necessary to take the\r\nlargest trees to make pulp wood. Hence many young trees of not more than\r\nsix inches in diameter are sacrificed. Of the hundreds of species of trees\r\nin our forests, the conifers are probably most sought after for lumber.\r\nPine, especially, is probably used more extensively than any other wood. It\r\nis used in all heavy construction work, frames of houses, bridges, masts,\r\nspars and timber of ships, floors, railway ties, and many other purposes.\r\nCedar is used for shingles, cabinetwork, lead pencils, etc.; hemlock and\r\nspruce for heavy timbers and, as we have seen, for paper pulp. Another use\r\nfor our lumber, especially odds and ends of all kinds, is in the\r\npacking-box industry. It is estimated that nearly 50 per cent of all lumber\r\ncut ultimately finds its way into the construction of boxes. Hemlock bark\r\nis used for tanning.\r\n\r\nThe hard woods--ash, basswood, beech, birch, cherry, chestnut, elm, maple,\r\noak, and walnut--are used largely for the \"trim\" of our houses, for\r\nmanufacture of furniture, wagon or car work, and endless other purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagrams of sections of timber. _a_, cross section; _b_,\r\nradial; _c_, tangential. (From Pinchot, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.)]\r\n\r\nMethods of cutting Timber.--A glance at the diagram of the sections of\r\ntimber shows us that a tree may be cut radially through the middle of the\r\ntrunk or tangentially to the middle portion. Most lumber is cut\r\ntangentially. In wood cut in this manner the yearly rings take a more or\r\nless irregular course. The grain in wood is caused by the fibers not taking\r\nstraight lines in their course in the tree trunk. In many cases the fibers\r\nof the wood take a spiral course up the trunk, or they may wave outward to\r\nform little projections. Boards cut out of such a piece of wood will show\r\nthe effect seen in many of the school desks, where the annual rings appear\r\nto form elliptical markings. Quite a difference in color and structure is\r\noften seen between the heartwood, composed of the dead walls of cells\r\noccupying the central part of the tree trunk, and the sapwood, the living\r\npart of the stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of a tree trunk showing knot.]\r\n\r\nKnots.--Knots, as can be seen from the diagram, are branches which at one\r\ntime started in their outward growth and were for some reason killed.\r\nLater, the tree, continuing in its outward growth, surrounded them and\r\ncovered them up. A dead limb should be pruned before such growth occurs.\r\nThe markings in bird's-eye maple are caused by buds which have not\r\ndeveloped, and have been overgrown with the wood of the tree.\r\n\r\nDestruction of the Forest.--_By Waste in Cutting._--Man is responsible for\r\nthe destruction of one of this nation's most valuable assets. This is\r\nprimarily due to wrong and wasteful lumbering. Hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars' worth of lumber is left to rot annually because the lumbermen do\r\nnot cut the trees close enough to the ground, or because through careless\r\nfelling of trees many other smaller trees are injured. There is great waste\r\nin the mills. In fact, man wastes in every step from the forest to the\r\nfinished product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A forest in the far west totally destroyed by fire and\r\nwasteful lumbering.]\r\n\r\n_By Fire._--Indirectly, man is responsible for fire, one of the greatest\r\nenemies of the forest. Most of the great forest fires of recent years, the\r\nlosses from which total in the hundreds of millions, have been due either\r\nto railroads or to carelessness in making fires in the woods. It is\r\nestimated that in forest lands traversed by railroads from 25 per cent to\r\n90 per cent of the fires are caused by coal-burning locomotives. For this\r\nreason laws have been made in New York State requiring locomotives passing\r\nthrough the Adirondack forest preserve to burn oil instead of coal. This\r\nhas resulted in a considerable reduction in the number of fires. In\r\naddition to the loss in timber, the fires often burn out the organic matter\r\nin the soil (the \"duff\") forming the forest floor, thus preventing the\r\ngrowth of forest there for many years to come. In New York and other states\r\nfires are fought by an organized corps of fire wardens, whose duty it is to\r\nwatch the forest and to fight forest fires.\r\n\r\nOther Enemies.--Other enemies of the forest are numerous fungus plants,\r\ninsect parasites which bore into the wood or destroy the leaves, and\r\ngrazing animals, particularly sheep. Wind and snow also annually kill many\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nForestry.--In some parts of central Europe, the value of the forests was\r\nseen as early as the year 1300 A.D., and many towns consequently bought up\r\nthe surrounding forests. The city of Zurich has owned forests in its\r\nvicinity for at least 600 years and has found them a profitable investment.\r\nIn this country only recently has the importance of preserving and caring\r\nfor our forests been noted by our government. Now, however, we have a\r\nForest Survey of the Department of Agriculture and numerous state and\r\nuniversity schools of forestry which are rapidly teaching the people of\r\nthis country the best methods for the preservation of our forests. The\r\nFederal government has set aside a number of tracts of mountain forest in\r\nsome of the Western states, making a total area of over 167,000,000 acres.\r\nNew York has established for the same purpose the Adirondack Park, with\r\nnearly 1,500,000 acres of timberland. Pennsylvania has one of 700,000\r\nacres, and many other states have followed their example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The forest primeval. Trees are killing each other in the\r\nstruggle for light and air.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A German beech forest. The trees are kept thinned out so as\r\nto allow the young trees to get a start. Contrast this with the picture\r\nabove.]\r\n\r\nMethods for Keeping and Protecting the Forests.--Forests should be kept\r\nthinned. Too many trees are as bad as too few. They struggle with one\r\nanother for foothold and light, which only a few can enjoy. In cutting the\r\nforest, it should be considered as a harvest. The oldest trees are the\r\n\"ripe grain,\" the younger trees being left to grow to maturity. Several\r\nmethods of renewing the forest are in use in this country. (1) Trees may be\r\ncut down and young ones allowed to sprout from cut stumps. This is called\r\ncoppice growth. This growth is well seen in parts of New Jersey. (2) Areas\r\nor strips may be cut out so that seeds from neighboring trees are carried\r\nthere to start new growth. (3) Forests may be artificially planted. Two\r\nseedlings planted for every tree cut is a rule followed in Europe. (4) The\r\nmost economical method is that shown in the lower picture on page 114,\r\nwhere the largest trees are thinned out over a large area so as to make\r\nroom for the younger ones to grow up. The greatest dangers to the forests\r\nare from fire and from careless cutting, and these dangers may be kept in\r\ncheck by the efficient work of our national and state foresters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: We must protect our city trees. This tree was badly wounded\r\nby being gnawed by a horse.]\r\n\r\nA City's Need for Trees.--The city of Paris, well known as one of the most\r\nbeautiful of European capitals, spends over $100,000 annually in caring for\r\nand replacing some of the 90,000 trees owned by the city. All over the\r\nUnited States the city governments are beginning to realize what European\r\ncities have long known, that trees are of great value to a city. They are\r\nnow following the example of European cities by planting trees and by\r\nprotecting the trees after they are planted. Thousands of city trees are\r\nannually killed by horses which gnaw the bark. This may be prevented by\r\nproper protection of the trunk by means of screens or wire guards. Chicago\r\nhas appointed a city forester, who has given the following excellent\r\nreasons why trees should be planted in the city:--\r\n\r\n(1) Trees are beautiful in form and color, inspiring a constant\r\nappreciation of nature.\r\n\r\n(2) Trees enhance the beauty of architecture.\r\n\r\n(3) Trees create sentiment, love of country, state, city, and home.\r\n\r\n(4) Trees have an educational influence upon citizens of all ages,\r\nespecially children.\r\n\r\n(5) Trees encourage outdoor life.\r\n\r\n(6) Trees purify the air.\r\n\r\n(7) Trees cool the air in summer and radiate warmth in winter.\r\n\r\n(8) Trees improve climate and conserve soil and moisture.\r\n\r\n(9) Trees furnish resting places and shelter for birds.\r\n\r\n(10) Trees increase the value of real estate.\r\n\r\n(11) Trees protect the pavement from the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\n(12) Trees counteract adverse conditions of city life.\r\n\r\nLet us all try to make Arbor Day what it should be, a day for\r\ncaring for and planting trees, for thus we may preserve this most\r\nimportant heritage of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

THE ECONOMIC RELATION OF GREEN PLANTS TO MAN\r\n\r\n_Problems.--How green plants are useful to man._\r\n          _(a) As food._\r\n          _(b) For clothing._\r\n          _(c) Other uses._\r\n          _How green plants are harmful to man._\r\n\r\n                   SUGGESTED LABORATORY WORK\r\n\r\n      If a commercial museum is available, a trip should be planned to work\r\n      over the topics in this chapter. The school collection may well\r\n      include most of the examples mentioned, both of useful and harmful\r\n      plants.\r\n\r\n      A study of weeds and poisonous plants should be taken up in actual\r\n      laboratory work, either by collection and identification or by\r\n      demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Plants have a \"Dollar and Cents\" Value.--To the girl or boy living in\r\nthe city green plants seem to have little direct value. Although we see\r\nvegetables for sale in stores and we know that fruits have a money value,\r\nwe are apt to forget that the wealth of our nation depends more upon its\r\ncrops than it does on its manufactories and business houses. The economic\r\nor \"dollars and cents\" value of plants is enormous and far too great for us\r\nto comprehend in terms of figures.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen some of the uses to mankind of the products of the\r\nforest; let us now consider some other plant products.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cabbage     Onions     Lettuce\r\n       Leaves used as food.]\r\n\r\nLeaves as Food.--Grazing animals feed almost entirely on tender shoots or\r\nleaves, blades of grass, and other herbage. Certain leaves and buds are\r\nused by man as food. Lettuce, beet tops, kale, spinach, broccoli, are\r\nexamples. A cabbage head is nothing but a big bud which has been cultivated\r\nby man. An onion is a compact budlike mass of thickened leaves which\r\ncontain stored food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Celery     Kohl-rabi     Potato     Sugar cane\r\n             Stems used as food.]\r\n\r\nStems as Food.--A city child would, if asked to name some stem used as\r\nfood, probably mention asparagus. We sometimes forget that one of our\r\ngreatest necessities, cane sugar, comes from the stem of sugar cane. Over\r\nseventy pounds of sugar is used each year by every person in the United\r\nStates. To supply the growing demand beets are now being raised for their\r\nsugar in many parts of the world, so that nearly half the total supply of\r\nsugar comes from this source. Maple sugar is a well-known commodity which\r\nis obtained by boiling the sap of sugar maple until it crystallizes. Over\r\n16,000 tons of maple sugar is obtained every spring, Vermont producing\r\nabout 40 per cent of the total output. The sago palm is another stem which\r\nsupports the life of many natives in Africa. Another stem, living\r\nunderground, forms one of man's staple articles of diet. This is the\r\npotato.\r\n\r\nRoots as Food.--Roots which store food for plants form important parts of\r\nman's vegetable diet. Beets, radishes, carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes,\r\nand many others might be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the proportion of foods in some of the commoner\r\nroots and stems:--\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n               | WATER| PROTEINS| CARBOHYDRATES| FAT | MINERAL MATTER\r\n  -------------+------+---------+--------------+-----+----------------\r\n  Potato       | 75   |   1.2   |     18       | 0.3 |    1.0\r\n  Carrot       | 89   |   0.5   |      5       | 0.2 |    1.0\r\n  Parsnip      | 81   |   1.2   |      8.7     | 1.5 |    1.0\r\n  Turnip       | 92.8 |   0.5   |      4.      | 0.1 |    0.8\r\n  Onion        | 91   |   1.5   |      4.8     | 0.2 |    0.5\r\n  Sweet potato | 74   |   1.5   |     20.2     | 0.1 |    1.5\r\n  Beet         | 82.2 |   0.4   |     13.4     | 0.1 |    0.9\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Wheat   Nuts   Pear   Melon\r\n   Seeds and fruits used for food.]\r\n\r\nFruits and Seeds as Foods.--Our cereal crops, corn, wheat, etc., have\r\nplayed a very great part in the civilization of man and are now of so much\r\nimportance to him as food products that bread made from flour from the\r\nwheat has been called the \"staff of life.\" Our grains are the cultivated\r\nprogeny of wild grasses. Domestication of plants and animals marks epochs\r\nin the advance of civilization. The man of the stone age hunted wild beasts\r\nfor food, and lived like one of them in a cave or wherever he happened to\r\nbe; he was a nomad, a wanderer, with no fixed home. He may have discovered\r\nthat wild roots or grains were good to eat; perhaps he stored some away for\r\nfuture use. Then came the idea of growing things at home instead of digging\r\nor gathering the wild fruits from the forest and plain. The tribes which\r\nfirst cultivated the soil made a great step in advance, for they had as a\r\nresult a fixed place for habitation. The cultivation of grains and cereals\r\ngave them a store of food which could be used at times when other food was\r\nscarce. The word \"cereal\" (derived from Ceres, the Roman Goddess of\r\nAgriculture) shows the importance of this crop to Roman civilization. From\r\nearliest times the growing of grain and the progress of civilization have\r\ngone hand in hand. As nations have advanced in power, their dependence upon\r\nthe cereal crops has been greater and greater.\r\n\r\n\"Indian corn,\" says John Fiske, in _The Discovery of America_, \"has played\r\na most important part in the history of the New World. It could be planted\r\nwithout clearing or plowing the soil. There was no need of threshing or\r\nwinnowing. Sown in tilled land, it yields more than twice as much food per\r\nacre as any other kind of grain. This was of incalculable advantage to the\r\nEnglish settlers in New England, who would have found it much harder to\r\ngain a secure foothold upon the soil if they had had to begin by preparing\r\nit for wheat or rye.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day, in spite of the great wealth which comes from our mineral\r\nresources, live stock, and manufactured products, the surest index of our\r\ncountry's prosperity is the size of the corn and wheat crop. According to\r\nthe last census, the amount of capital invested in agriculture was over\r\n$20,000,000,000, while that invested in manufacture was less than one half\r\nthat amount.\r\n\r\nCorn.--About three billion bushels of corn were raised in the United States\r\nduring the year 1910. This figure is so enormous that it has but little\r\nmeaning to us. In the past half century our corn crop has increased over\r\n350 per cent. Illinois and Iowa are the greatest corn-producing states,\r\neach having a yearly record of over four hundred million bushels. The\r\nfigure on this page shows the principal corn-producing areas in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Indian Corn Production--Percentage]\r\n\r\nIndian corn is put to many uses. It is a valuable food. It contains a large\r\nproportion of starch, from which glucose (grape sugar) and alcohol are\r\nmade. Machine oil and soap are made from it. The leaves and stalk are an\r\nexcellent fodder; they can be made into paper and packing material.\r\nMattresses can be stuffed with the husks. The pith is used as a protective\r\nbelt placed below the water line of our huge battleships. Corn cobs are\r\nused for fuel, one hundred bushels having the fuel value of a ton of coal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wheat Crop in United States--Percentage Source]\r\n\r\nWheat.--Wheat is the crop of next greatest importance in size. Nearly seven\r\nhundred millions of bushels were raised in this country in 1910,\r\nrepresenting a total money value of over $700,000,000. Seventy-two per cent\r\nof all the wheat raised comes from the North Central states and California.\r\nAbout three fourths of the wheat crop is exported, nearly one half of it to\r\nGreat Britain, thus indirectly giving employment to thousands of people on\r\nrailways and steamships. Wheat has its chief use in its manufacture into\r\nflour. The germ, or young wheat plant, is sifted out during this process\r\nand made into breakfast foods. Flour making forms the chief industry of\r\nMinneapolis, Minnesota, and of several other large and wealthy cities in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A field of rice, showing the conditions of culture.]\r\n\r\nOther Grains.--Of the other grain and cereals raised in this country, oats\r\nare the most important crop, over one billion bushels having been produced\r\nin 1910. Barley is another grain, a staple of some of the northern\r\ncountries of Europe and Asia. In this country, it is largely used in making\r\nmalt for the manufacture of beer. Rye is the most important cereal crop of\r\nnorthern Europe, Russia, Germany, and Austro-Hungary producing over 50 per\r\ncent of the world's supply. One of the most important grain crops for the\r\nworld (although relatively unimportant in the United States) is rice. The\r\nfruit of this grasslike plant, after thrashing, screening, and milling,\r\nforms the principal food of one third of the human race. Moreover, its\r\nstems furnish straw, its husks make a bran used as food for cattle, and the\r\ngrain, when fermented and distilled, yields alcohol.\r\n\r\nGarden Fruits.--Green plants and especially vegetables have\r\ncome to play an important part in the dietary of man. The\r\ndiseases known as scurvy and beri-beri, the latter the curse of the\r\nfar Eastern navies, have been largely prevented by adding vegetables\r\nand fruit juices to the dietary of the sailors. People in\r\nthis country are beginning to find that more vegetables and less\r\nmeat are better than the meat diet so often used. Market gardening\r\nforms the lucrative business of many thousands of people\r\nnear our great cities. Some of the more important fruits are\r\nsquash, cucumbers, pumpkins, melons, tomatoes, peppers, strawberries,\r\nraspberries, and blackberries. The latter fruits bring in\r\nan annual income of $25,000,000 to our market gardeners. Beans\r\nand peas are important as foods because of their relatively large\r\namount of protein. Canning green corn, peas, beans, and tomatoes\r\nhas become an important industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picking apples, an important crop in some parts of the\r\nUnited States.]\r\n\r\nOrchard and Other Fruits.--In the United States over one hundred and\r\nseventy-five million bushels of apples are grown every year. Pears, plums,\r\napricots, peaches, and nectarines also form large orchards, especially in\r\nCalifornia. Nuts form one of our important articles of food, largely\r\nbecause of the large amount of protein contained in them.\r\n\r\nThe grape crop of the world is commercially valuable, because of the\r\nraisins and wine produced. The culture of lemons, oranges, and grapefruit\r\nhas come in recent years to give a living to many people in this country as\r\nwell as in other parts of the world. Figs, olives, and dates are staple\r\nfoods in the Mediterranean countries and are sources of wealth to the\r\npeople there, as are coconuts, bananas, and many other fruits in tropical\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nBeverages and Condiments.--The coffee and cacao beans, and leaves of the\r\ntea plant, products of tropical regions, form the basis of very important\r\nbeverages of civilized man. Pepper, black and red, mustard, allspice,\r\nnutmegs, cloves, and vanilla are all products manufactured from various\r\nfruits or seeds of tropical plants.\r\n\r\nAlcoholic liquors are produced from various plants in different parts of\r\nthe world, the dried fruit of the hop vine being an important product of\r\nNew York State used in the making of beer.\r\n\r\nRaw Materials.--Besides use as food, green plants have many other uses.\r\nMany of our city industries would not be in existence, were it not for\r\ncertain plant products which furnish the raw materials for many\r\nmanufacturing industries. Many cities of the east and south, for example,\r\ndepend upon cotton to give employment to thousands of factory hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cotton Crop in United States--Percentage Source\r\n               Cotton Crop in United States--Percentage Consumption]\r\n\r\nCotton.--Of our native plant products cotton is probably of the most\r\nimportance to the outside world. Over eleven million bales of five hundred\r\npounds each are raised annually.\r\n\r\nThe cotton plant thrives in warm regions. Its commercial importance is\r\ngained because the seeds of the fruit have long filaments attached to them.\r\nBunches of these filaments, after treatment, are easily twisted into\r\nthreads from which are manufactured cotton cloth, muslin, calico, and\r\ncambric. In addition to the fiber, cottonseed oil, a substitute for olive\r\noil, is made from the seeds, and the refuse remaining makes an excellent\r\ncattle fodder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map showing the spread of the cotton boll weevil. It was\r\nintroduced from Mexico about 1894. What proportion of the cotton raising\r\nbelt was infected in 1908?]\r\n\r\nCotton Boll Weevil.--The cotton crop of the United States has rather\r\nrecently been threatened with destruction by a beetle called the cotton\r\nboll weevil. This insect, which bores into the young pod of the cotton,\r\ndevelops there, stunting the growth of the fruit to such an extent that\r\nseeds are not produced. The loss in Texas alone is estimated at over\r\n$10,000,000 a year. The boll weevil, because of the protection offered by\r\nthe cotton boll, is very difficult to exterminate. The weevils are\r\ndestroyed by birds, the infected bolls and stalks are burnt, millions are\r\nkilled each winter by cold, other insects prey on them, but at the present\r\ntime they are one of the greatest pests the south knows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mexican cotton boll weevil. Much enlarged, above; natural\r\nsize, below. (Herrick.)]\r\n\r\nThe control of this pest seems to depend upon early planting so that the\r\ncrop has an opportunity to ripen before the insects in the boll grow large\r\nenough to do harm. Ultimately the boll weevil may do more good than harm by\r\nbringing into the market a type of cotton plant that ripens very early.\r\n\r\nVegetable Fibers.--Among the most important are Manila hemp, which comes\r\nfrom the leaf-stalks of a plant of the banana family and true hemp, which\r\nis the bast or woody fiber of a plant cultivated in most warm parts of the\r\nearth. Flax is also an important fiber plant, grown largely in Russia and\r\nother parts of Europe (see picture on next page). From the bast fibers of\r\nthe stem of this herb linen cloth is made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flax grown for fiber.]\r\n\r\nVegetable Oils.--Some of the same plants which give fiber also produce oil.\r\nCotton seed oil pressed from the seeds, linseed oil from the seeds of the\r\nflax plant, and coconut oil (the covering of the nut here producing the\r\nfiber) are examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Poison ivy, a climbing plant which is poisonous to touch.\r\nNotice the leaves in threes.]\r\n\r\nSome Harmful Green Plants.--We have seen that on the whole green plants are\r\nuseful to man. There are, however, some that are harmful. For example, the\r\npoison ivy is extremely poisonous to touch. The poison ivy is a climbing\r\nplant which attaches itself to the trees or walls by means of tiny air\r\nroots which grow out from the stem. It is distinguished from its harmless\r\nclimbing neighbor, the Virginia Creeper, by the fact that its leaves are\r\nnotched in _threes_ instead of _fives_. Every boy and girl should know\r\npoison ivy.\r\n\r\nNumerous other poisonous common plants are found, but one other deserves\r\nspecial notice because of its presence in vacant city lots. The Jimson Weed\r\n(_Datura_) is a bushy plant, from two to five feet high, bearing large\r\nleaves. It has white or purplish flowers, and later bears a four-valved\r\nseed pod containing several hundred seeds. These plants contain a powerful\r\npoison, and people are often made seriously ill by eating the roots or\r\nother parts by mistake.\r\n\r\nWeeds.--From the economic standpoint the green plants which do the greatest\r\ndamage are weeds. Those plants which provide best for their young are\r\nusually the most successful in life's race. Plants which combine with the\r\nability to scatter many seeds over a wide territory the additional\r\ncharacteristics of rapid growth, resistance to dangers of extreme cold or\r\nheat, attacks of enemies, inedibility, and peculiar adaptations to\r\ncross-pollination or self-pollination, are usually spoken of as weeds. They\r\nflourish in the sterile soil of the roadside and in the fertile soil of the\r\ngarden. By means of rapid growth they kill other plants of slower growth by\r\nusurping their territory. Slow-growing plants are thus actually\r\nexterminated. Many of our common weeds have been introduced from other\r\ncountries and have, through their numerous adaptations, driven out other\r\nplants which stood in their way. Such is the Russian Thistle. A single\r\nplant of this kind will give rise to over 20,000 seeds. First introduced\r\nfrom Russia in 1873, it spread so rapidly that in twenty years it had\r\nappeared as a common weed over an area of some twenty-five thousand square\r\nmiles. It is now one of the greatest pests in our Northwest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

But not all plants are green. Most of us are familiar with the\r\nedible mushroom sold in the markets or the so-called \"toadstools\" found in\r\nparks or lawns. These plants contain no chlorophyll and hence do not make\r\ntheir own food. They are members of the plant group called _fungi_. Such\r\nplants are almost as much dependent upon the green plants for food as are\r\nanimals. But the fungi require for the most part dead organic matter for\r\ntheir food. This may be obtained from decayed vegetable or animal material\r\nin soil, from the bodies of dead plants and animals, or even from foods\r\nprepared for man. Fungi which feed upon _dead_ organic material are known\r\nas _saprophytes_. Examples are the mushrooms, the yeasts, molds, and some\r\nbacteria, of which more will be learned later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chestnut trees in a New York City park; killed by a\r\nparasite, the chestnut canker.]\r\n\r\nSome Parasitic Fungi.--Other fungi (and we will find this applies to some\r\nanimals as well) prefer _living_ plants or animals for their food. Thus a\r\ntiny plant, recently introduced into this country, known as the chestnut\r\ncanker, is killing our chestnut trees by the thousands in the eastern part\r\nof the United States. It produces millions of tiny reproductive cells known\r\nas _spores_; these spores, blown about by the wind, light on the trees,\r\nsprout, and send in under the bark a threadlike structure which sucks in\r\nthe food circulating in the living cells, eventually causing the death of\r\nthe tree. _A plant or animal which lives at the expense of another living\r\nplant or animal is called a parasite._ The chestnut canker is a dangerous\r\nparasite. Later we shall see that animal and plant parasites destroy yearly\r\ncrops and trees valued at hundreds of millions of dollars and cause untold\r\nmisery and suffering to humanity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shelf fungi. (Photographed by W. C. Barbour.)]\r\n\r\nAnother fungus which does much harm to the few trees found in large towns\r\nand cities is the shelf or bracket fungus. The part of the body visible on\r\nthe tree looks like a shelf or bracket, hence the name. This bracket is in\r\nreality the reproductive part of the plant; on its lower surface are formed\r\nmillions of little bodies called _spores_. These spores are capable, under\r\nfavorable conditions, of reproducing new plants. The true body of the\r\nplant, a network of threads, is found under the bark. This fungus begins\r\nits life as a spore in some part of the tree which has become _diseased_ or\r\n_broken_. Once established, it spreads rapidly. There is no remedy except\r\nto kill the tree and burn it, so as to destroy the spores. Many fine trees,\r\nsound except for a slight bruise or other injury, are annually infected and\r\neventually killed. In cities thousands of trees become infected through\r\ncareless hitching of horses so that the horse may gnaw the tree, thus\r\nexposing a fresh surface on which spores may obtain lodgment and grow (see\r\npage 115).\r\n\r\nSuggestions for Field Work.--A field trip to a park or grove near home may\r\nshow the great destruction of timber by this means. Count the number of\r\nperfect trees in a given area. Compare it with the number of trees attacked\r\nby the fungus. Does the fungus appear to be transmitted from one tree to\r\nanother near at hand? In how many instances can you discover the point\r\nwhere the fungus first attacked the tree?\r\n\r\nFungi of our Homes.--But not all fungi are wild. Some have become\r\nintroduced into our homes and these live on food or other materials. _These\r\nplants are very important because of their relation to life in a town or\r\ncrowded city._[17]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 17: Experiments on conditions favorable to growth\r\n     of mold should be introduced here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bread mold; _r_, rhizoids; _s_, fruiting bodies containing\r\nspores.]\r\n\r\nThe Growth of Bread Mold.--If a piece of moist bread is exposed to the air\r\nof the schoolroom, or in your own kitchen for a few minutes and then\r\ncovered with a glass tumbler and kept in a warm place, in a day or two a\r\nfuzzy whitish growth will appear on the surface of the bread. This growth\r\nshortly turns black. If we now examine a little piece of the bread with a\r\nlens or low-powered microscope, we find a tangled mass of threads (the\r\n_mycelium_) covering the surface of the bread. From this mass of threads\r\nproject tiny upright stalks bearing round black bodies, the fruit. Little\r\nrootlike structures known as _rhizoids_ dip down into the bread, and absorb\r\nfood for its threadlike body. The upright threads with the balls at the end\r\ncontain many tiny bodies called _spores_. These spores have been formed by\r\nthe division of the protoplasm making up the fruiting bodies into many\r\nseparate cells. When grown under favorable conditions, the spores will\r\nproduce more mycelia, which in turn bear fruiting bodies.\r\n\r\nPhysiology of the Growth of Mold.--Molds, in order to grow rapidly, need\r\noxygen, moisture, and moderate heat. They seem to prefer dark, damp places\r\nwhere there is not a free circulation of air, for if the bell jar is\r\nremoved from growing mold for even a short time, the mold wilts. Too great\r\nor very little heat will prevent growth and kill everything except the\r\nspores. They obtain their food from the material on which they live. This\r\nthey are able to do by means of digestive enzymes given out by the rootlike\r\nparts, by means of which the molds cling to the bread. These digestive\r\nenzymes change the starch of the bread to sugar and the protein to a\r\nsoluble form which will pass by osmosis into cells of the mold. Thus the\r\nmold is able to absorb food material. These foods are then used to supply\r\nenergy and make protoplasm. This seems to be the usual method by which\r\nsaprophytes make use of the materials on which they live.\r\n\r\nWhat can Molds live On?--We have seen that black mold lives upon bread. We\r\nwould find that it or some other mold (_e.g._ green or blue mold) live upon\r\ndecaying or overripe fruit,--apples, peaches, and plums being especially\r\nsusceptible to their growth. Molds feed upon all cakes or breads, upon\r\nmeat, cheese, and many raw vegetables. They are almost sure to grow upon\r\nflour if it is allowed to get damp. Moisture seems necessary for their\r\ngrowth. Jelly is a substance particularly favorable to molds for this\r\nreason. Shoes, leather, cloth, paper, or even moist wood will give food\r\nenough to support their growth. At least one troublesome disease,\r\n_ringworm_, is due to the growth of molds in the skin.\r\n\r\nWhat Mold does to Foods.--Mold usually changes the taste of the material it\r\ngrows upon, rendering it \"musty\" and sometimes unfit to eat. Eventually it\r\nwill spoil food completely because decay sets in. Decay, as we will see\r\nlater, is not entirely due to mold growth, but is usually caused by another\r\ngroup of organisms, the _bacteria_. Molds, however, in feeding _do_ cause\r\nchemical changes which result in decay or putrefaction. Some molds are\r\nuseful. They give the flavor to Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Camembert, and Brie\r\ncheeses. But on the whole molds are pests which the housekeeper wishes to\r\nget rid of.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent Molds.[18]--As we have seen, moisture is favorable for mold\r\ngrowth; conversely, dryness is unfavorable. Inasmuch as the spores of mold\r\nabound in the air, materials which cannot be kept dry should be covered.\r\nJelly after it is made should at once be tightly covered with a thin layer\r\nof paraffin, which excludes the air and possible mold spores. Or waxed\r\npaper may be fastened over the surface of the jelly so as to exclude the\r\nspores. To prevent molds from attacking fresh fruit, the surface of the\r\nfruit should be kept dry and, if possible, each piece of fruit should be\r\nwrapped in paper. Why? Heating with dry heat to 212 deg. for a few moments will\r\nkill any mold spores that happen to be in food. Moldy food, if heated after\r\nremoving surface on which the mold grew, is perfectly good to eat.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 18: An experiment to show conditions unfavorable\r\n     for growth of molds should be shown at this point.\r\n\r\nDry dusting or sweeping will raise dust, which usually contains mold\r\nspores. Use a dampened broom or dust cloth frequently in the kitchen if you\r\nwish to preserve foods from molds.\r\n\r\nOther Moldlike Fungi.--Mildews are near relatives of the molds found in our\r\nhomes. They may attack leather, cloth, etc., in a damp house. Other allied\r\nforms may do damage to living plants. Some of these live upon the lilac,\r\nrose, or willow. These fungi do not penetrate the host plant to any depth,\r\nfor they obtain their food from the outer layer of cells in the leaf of\r\ntheir host and cover the leaves with the whitish threads of the mycelium.\r\nHence they may be killed by means of applications of some fungus-killing\r\nfluid, as Bordeaux mixture.[19] Among the useful plants preyed upon by\r\nmildews are the plum, cherry, and peach trees. (The diseases known as black\r\nknot and peach curl are thus caused.) Another important member of this\r\ngroup is the tiny parasite found on rye and other grains, which gives us\r\nthe drug ergot.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 19: See Goff and Mayne, _First Principles of\r\n     Agriculture_, page 59, for formula of Bordeaux mixture.\r\n\r\nAmong other parasitic fungi are rusts and smuts. Wheat rust is probably the\r\nmost destructive parasitic fungus. Indirectly this parasite is of\r\nconsiderable importance to the citizen of a great city because of its\r\neffect upon the price of wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nYEASTS IN THEIR RELATION TO MAN\r\n\r\nFermentation.--It is of common knowledge to country boys or girls that the\r\njuice of fresh apples, grapes, and some other fruits, if allowed to stand\r\nexposed to the air for a short time will _ferment_. That is, the sweet\r\njuice will begin to taste sour and to have a peculiar odor, which we\r\nrecognize as that of alcohol. The fermenting juice appears to be full of\r\nbubbles which rise to the surface. If we collect enough of these bubbles of\r\ngas to make a test, we find it to be carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nEvidently something changed some part of the apple or grape, the sugar,\r\n(C{6}H{12}O{6}), into alcohol, 2(C{2}H{6}O), and carbon dioxide, 2(CO{2}).\r\nThis chemical process is known as _fermentation_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apparatus to show effect of fermentation. _N_, molasses,\r\nwater and yeast plants; _C_, bubbles of carbon dioxide.]\r\n\r\nYeast causes Fermentation.--Let us now take a compressed yeast cake, shake\r\nup a small portion of it in a solution of molasses and water, and fill a\r\nfermentation tube with the mixture. Leave the tube in a warm place\r\novernight. In the morning a gas will be found to have been collected in the\r\nclosed end of the tube (see Figure on page 138). The taste and\r\nodor of the liquid shows alcohol to be present, and the gas, if tested, is\r\nproven carbon dioxide. Evidently yeast causes fermentation.\r\n\r\nWhat are Yeasts?--If now part of the liquid from the fermentation tube\r\nwhich contains the settlings be drawn off, a drop placed on a slide and a\r\nlittle weak iodine added and the mixture examined under the compound\r\nmicroscope, two kinds of structures will be found (see Figure below),\r\nstarch grains which are stained deep blue, and other smaller ovoid\r\nstructures of a brownish yellow color. The latter are yeast plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yeast and starch grains. Notice that the starch grains\r\naround which are clustered yeast cells have been rounded off by the yeast\r\nplants. How do you account for this?]\r\n\r\nSize and Shape, Manner of Growth, etc.--The common compressed yeast cake\r\ncontains millions of these tiny plants. In its simplest form a yeast plant\r\nis a single cell. The shape of such a plant is ovoid, each cell showing\r\nunder the microscope the granular appearance of the protoplasm of which it\r\nis formed. Look for tiny clear areas in the cells; these are vacuoles, or\r\nspaces filled with fluid. The nucleus is hard to find in a yeast cell. Many\r\nof the cells seem to have others attached to them, sometimes there being\r\nseveral in a row. Yeast cells reproduce very rapidly by a process of\r\nbudding, a part of the parent cell forming one or more smaller daughter\r\ncells which eventually become free from the parent.\r\n\r\nConditions favorable to growth of Yeast.--_Experiment._--Label three pint\r\nfruit jars A, B, and C. Add one fourth of a compressed yeast cake to two\r\ncups of water containing two tablespoonfuls of molasses or sugar. Stir the\r\nmixture well and divide it into three equal parts and pour them into the\r\njars. Place covers on the jars. Put jar A in the ice box on the ice, and\r\njar B over the kitchen stove or near a radiator; pour the contents of jar C\r\ninto a small pan and boil for a few minutes. Pour back into C, cover and\r\nplace it next to B. After forty-eight hours, look to see if any bubbles\r\nhave made their appearance in any of the jars. If the experiment has been\r\nsuccessful, only jar B will show bubbles. After bubbles have begun to\r\nappear at the surface, the fluid in jar B will be found to have a sour\r\ntaste and will smell unpleasantly. The gas which rises to the surface, if\r\ncollected and tested, will be found to be carbon dioxide. The contents of\r\njar B have fermented. Evidently, the growth of yeast will take place only\r\nunder conditions of moderate warmth and moisture.\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates necessary to Fermentation.--Sugar must be present in order\r\nfor fermentation to take place. The wild yeasts cause fermentation of the\r\napple or grape juice because they live on the skin of the apple or grape.\r\nVarious peoples recognize this when they collect the juice of certain\r\nfruits and, exposing it to the air, allow it to ferment. Such is the _saki_\r\nor rice wine of the Japanese, the _tuba_ or sap of the coconut palm of the\r\nFilipinos and the _pulque_ of the Mexicans.\r\n\r\nBeer and Wine Making.--Brewers' yeasts are cultivated with the greatest\r\ncare; for the different flavors of beer seem to depend largely upon the\r\ncondition of the yeast plants. Beer is made in the following manner.\r\nSprouted barley, called malt, in which the starch of the grain has been\r\nchanged to grape sugar by digestion, is killed by drying in a hot kiln. The\r\nmalt is dissolved in water, and hops are added to give the mixture a bitter\r\ntaste. Now comes the addition of the yeast plants, which multiply rapidly\r\nunder the favorable conditions of food and heat. Fermentation results on a\r\nlarge scale from the breaking down of the grape sugar, the alcohol\r\nremaining in the fluid, and the carbon dioxide passing off into the air. At\r\nthe right time the beer is stored either in bottles or casks, but\r\nfermentation slowly continues, forming carbon dioxide in the bottles. This\r\ngives the sparkle to beer when it is poured from the bottle.\r\n\r\nIn wine making the wild yeasts growing on the skin of the grapes set up a\r\nslow fermentation. It takes several weeks before the wine is ready to\r\nbottle. In sparkling wines a second fermentation in the bottles gives rise\r\nto carbon dioxide in such quantity as to cause a decided frothing when the\r\nbottle is opened.\r\n\r\nCommercial Yeast.--Cultivated yeasts are now supplied in the home as\r\ncompressed or dried yeast cakes. In both cases the yeast plants are mixed\r\nwith starch and other substances and pressed into a cake. But the\r\ncompressed yeast cake must be used fresh, as the yeast plants begin to die\r\nrapidly after two or three days. The dried yeast cake, while it contains a\r\nmuch smaller number of yeast plants, is nevertheless probably more reliable\r\nif the yeast cannot be obtained fresh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a_  _b_  _c_]\r\n\r\nThe cut illustrates an experiment that shows how yeast plants depend upon\r\nfood in order to grow. In each of three fermentation tubes were placed an\r\nequal amount of a compressed yeast cake. Then tube _a_ was filled with\r\ndistilled water, tube _b_ with a solution of glucose and water, and tube\r\n_c_ with a nutrient solution containing nitrogenous matter as well as\r\nglucose. The quantity of gas (CO{2}) in each tube is an index of the amount\r\nof growth of the yeast cells. In which tube did the greatest growth take\r\nplace?\r\n\r\nBread Making.--Most of us are familiar with the process of bread making.\r\nThe materials used are flour, milk or water or both, salt, a little sugar\r\nto hasten the process of fermentation, or \"_rising_,\" as it is called, some\r\nbutter or lard, and yeast.\r\n\r\nAfter mixing the materials thoroughly by a process called \"kneading,\" the\r\nbread is put aside in a warm place (about 75 deg. Fahrenheit) to \"rise.\" If we\r\nexamine the dough at this time, we find it filled with holes, which give\r\nthe mass a spongy appearance. The yeast plants, owing to favorable\r\nconditions, have grown rapidly and filled the cavities with carbon dioxide.\r\nAlcohol is present, too, but this is evaporated when the dough is baked.\r\nThe baking cooks the starch of the bread, drives off the carbon dioxide and\r\nalcohol, and kills the yeast plants, besides forming a protective crust on\r\nthe loaf.\r\n\r\nSour Bread.--If yeast cakes are not fresh, sour bread may result from their\r\nuse. In such yeast cakes there are apt to be present other tiny one-celled\r\nplants, known as _bacteria_. Certain of these plants form acids after\r\nfermentation takes place. The sour taste of the bread is usually due to\r\nthis cause. The remedy would be to have fresh yeast, to have good and fresh\r\nflour, and to have clean vessels with which to work.\r\n\r\nImportance of Yeasts.--Yeasts in their relation to man are thus seen to be\r\nfor the most part useful. They may get into canned substances put up in\r\nsugar and cause them to \"work,\" giving them a peculiar flavor. But they can\r\nbe easily killed by heating to the temperature of boiling. On the other\r\nhand, yeast plants are necessary for the existence of all the great\r\nindustries which depend upon fermentation. And best of all they give us\r\nleavened bread, which has become a necessity to most of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIA IN THEIR RELATION TO MAN\r\n\r\nWhat Bacteria do and Where They May be Found.--A walk through a crowded\r\ncity street on any warm day makes one fully alive to odors which pervade\r\nthe atmosphere. Some of these unpleasant odors, if traced, are found to\r\ncome from garbage pails, from piles of decaying fruit or vegetables, or\r\nfrom some butcher shop in which decayed meat is allowed to stand. This\r\ncharacteristic phenomena of decay is one of the numerous ways in which we\r\ncan detect the presence of bacteria. These tiny plants, \"man's invisible\r\nfriends and foes,\" are to be found \"anywhere, but not everywhere,\" in\r\nnature. They swarm in stale milk, in impure water, in soil, in the living\r\nbodies of plants and animals and in their dead bodies as well. Most\r\n\"catching\" diseases we know to be caused directly by them; the processes of\r\ndecay, souring of milk, acid fermentation, the manufacture of nitrogen for\r\nplants are directly or indirectly due to their presence. It will be the\r\npurpose of the next paragraphs to find some of the places where bacteria\r\nmay be found and how we may know of their presence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A steam sterilizer.]\r\n\r\nHow we catch Bacteria to Study Them.--To study bacteria it is first\r\nnecessary to find some material in which they will grow, then kill all\r\nliving matter in this food material by heating to boiling point (212 deg.) for\r\nhalf an hour or more (this is called _sterilization_), and finally protect\r\nthe _culture medium_, as this food is called, from other living things that\r\nmight grow upon it.\r\n\r\nOne material in which bacteria seem to thrive is a mixture of beef extract,\r\ndigested protein and gelatine or agar-agar, the latter a preparation\r\nderived from seaweed. This mixture, after sterilization, is poured into\r\nflat dishes with loose-fitting covers. These _petri_ dishes, so called\r\nafter their inventor, are the traps in which we collect and study bacteria.\r\n\r\nWhere Bacteria might Grow.--Expose a number of these sterilized dishes,\r\neach for the same length of time, to some of the following conditions:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) exposed to the air of the schoolroom.\r\n  (_b_) exposed in the halls of the school while pupils are passing.\r\n  (_c_) exposed in the halls of the school when pupils are not moving.\r\n  (_d_) exposed at the level of a dirty and much-used city street.\r\n  (_e_) exposed at the level of a well-swept and little-used city street.\r\n  (_f_) exposed in a city park.\r\n  (_g_) exposed in a factory building.\r\n  (_h_) dirt from hands placed in dish.\r\n  (_i_) rub interior of mouth with finger and touch surface of dish.\r\n  (_j_) touch surface of dish with decayed vegetable or meat.\r\n  (_k_) touch surface of dish with dirty coin or bill.\r\n  (_l_) place in dish two or three hairs from boy's head.\r\n\r\nThis list might be prolonged indefinitely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonies of bacteria growing in a petri dish.]\r\n\r\nNow let us place all of the dishes together in a moderately warm place (a\r\ncloset in the schoolroom will do) and watch for results. After a day or two\r\nlittle spots, brown, yellow, white, or red, will begin to appear. These\r\nspots, which grow larger day by day, are _colonies_ made up of millions of\r\nbacteria. But probably each colony arose from a single bacterium which got\r\ninto the dish when it was exposed to the air.\r\n\r\nHow we may isolate Bacteria of Certain Kinds from Others.--In order to get\r\na number of bacteria of a given kind to study, it becomes necessary to grow\r\nthem in what is known as a pure culture. This is done by first growing the\r\nbacteria in some medium such as beef broth, gelatin, or on potato.[20] Then\r\nas growth follows the colonies of bacteria appear in the culture media or\r\nthe beef broth becomes cloudy. If now we wish to study one given form, it\r\nbecomes necessary to isolate them from the others. This is done by the\r\nfollowing process: a platinum needle is first passed through a flame to\r\n_sterilize_ it; that is, to kill all living things that may be on the\r\nneedle point. Then the needle, which cools very quickly, is dipped in a\r\ncolony containing the bacteria we wish to study. This mass of bacteria is\r\nquickly transferred to another sterilized plate, and this plate is\r\nimmediately covered to prevent any other forms of bacteria from entering.\r\nWhen we have succeeded in isolating a certain kind of bacterium in a given\r\ndish, we are said to have a _pure culture_. Having obtained a pure culture\r\nof bacteria, they may easily be studied under the compound microscope.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 20: For directions for making a culture medium, see\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_. Culture\r\n     tubes may be obtained, already prepared, from Parke, Davis,\r\n     and Company or other good chemists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A pure culture of bacteria. Notice that the bacteria are all\r\nthe same size and shape.]\r\n\r\nSize and Form.--In size, bacteria are the most minute plants known. A\r\nbacterium of average size is about 1/10000 of an inch in length, and\r\nperhaps 1/50000 of an inch in diameter. Some species are much larger,\r\nothers smaller. A common spherical form is 1/50000 of an inch in diameter.\r\nThey are so small that several million are often found in a single drop of\r\nimpure water or sour milk. Three well-defined forms of bacteria are\r\nrecognized: a spherical form called a _coccus_, a rod-shaped bacterium, the\r\n_bacillus_, and a spiral form, the _spirillum_. Some bacteria are capable\r\nof movement when living in a fluid. Such movement is caused by tiny\r\nlashlike threads of protoplasm called _flagella_. The flagella project from\r\nthe body, and by a rapid movement cause locomotion to take place. Bacteria\r\nreproduce with almost incredible rapidity. It is estimated that a single\r\nbacterium, by a process of division called _fission_, will give rise to\r\nover 16,700,000 others in twenty-four hours. Under unfavorable conditions\r\nthey stop dividing and form rounded bodies called spores. This spore is\r\nusually protected by a wall and may withstand very unfavorable conditions\r\nof dryness or heat; even boiling for several minutes will not kill some\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A figure to show the relative size and shape of (1) a green\r\nmold, (2) yeast cells, and (3) different forms of bacteria; _B_, bacillus;\r\n_C_, coccus; _S_, spirillum forms. The yeast and bacteria are drawn to\r\nscale, they are much enlarged in proportion to the green mold, being\r\nactually much smaller than the mold spores seen at the top of the picture.]\r\n\r\nWhere Bacteria are most Numerous.--As the result of our experiments, we can\r\nmake some generalizations concerning the presence of bacteria in our own\r\nenvironment. They are evidently present in the air, and in greater quantity\r\nin air that is moving than quiet air. Why? That they stick to particles of\r\ndust can be proven by placing a little dust from the schoolroom in a\r\nculture dish. Bacteria are present in greater numbers where crowds of\r\npeople live and move, the air from dusty streets of a populous city\r\ncontains many more bacteria than does the air of a village street. The air\r\nof a city park contains relatively few bacteria as compared with the\r\nnear-by street. The air of the woods or high mountains fewer still. Why?\r\nOur previous experiment has shown that dirt on our hands, the mouth and\r\nteeth, decayed meat and vegetables, dirty money, the very hairs of our head\r\nare all carriers of bacteria.\r\n\r\nFluids the Favorite Home of Bacteria.--Tap water, standing water, milk,\r\nvinegar, wine, cider all can be proven to contain bacteria by experiments\r\nsimilar to those quoted above. Spring or artesian well water would have\r\nvery few, if any, bacteria, while the same quantity of river water, if it\r\nheld any sewage, might contain untold millions of these little organisms.\r\n\r\nFoods preferred by Bacteria.--If bacteria are living and contain no\r\nchlorophyll, we should expect them to obtain protein food in order to grow.\r\nSuch is not always the case, for some bacteria seem to be able to build up\r\nprotein out of simple inorganic nitrogenous substances. If, however, we\r\ntake several food substances, some containing much protein and others not\r\nso much, we will find that the bacteria cause decay in the proteins almost\r\nat once, while other food substances are not always attacked by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Growth of bacteria in a drop of impure water allowed to run\r\ndown a sterilized culture in a dish.]\r\n\r\nWhat Bacteria do to Foods.--When bacteria feed upon a protein they use part\r\nof the materials in the food so that it falls to pieces and eventually\r\nrots. The material left behind after the bacteria have finished their meal\r\nis quite different from its original form. It is broken down by the action\r\nof the bacteria into gases, fluids, and some solids. It has a\r\ncharacteristic \"rotten\" odor and it has in it poisons which come as a\r\nresult of the work of the bacteria. These poisonous wastes, called\r\n_ptomaines_, we shall learn more about later.\r\n\r\nConditions Favorable and Unfavorable to the Growth of Bacteria.--Moisture\r\nand Dryness.--_Experiment_.--Take two beans, remove the skins, crush one,\r\nsoak the second bean overnight and then crush it. Place in test tubes, one\r\ndry, the second with water. Leave in a warm place two or three days, then\r\nsmell each tube. In which is decay taking place? In which tube are bacteria\r\nat work? How do you know?\r\n\r\nMoisture.--Moisture is an absolute need for bacterial growth, consequently\r\nkeeping material dry will prevent the growth of germs upon its surface.\r\nFoods, in order to decay, must contain enough water to make them moist.\r\nBacteria grow most freely in fluids.\r\n\r\nLight.--If we cover one half of a petri dish in which bacteria are growing\r\nwith black paper and then place the dish in a light warm place for a few\r\ndays, the growth of bacteria in the light part of the dish will be found to\r\nbe checked, while growth continues in the covered part. It is a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge that disease germs thrive where dirt and darkness exist\r\nand are killed by any long exposure to sunlight. This shows us the need of\r\nlight in our homes, especially in our bedrooms.\r\n\r\nAir.--We have seen that plants need oxygen in order to perform the work\r\nthat they do. This is equally true of all animals. But not all bacteria\r\nneed _air_ to live; in fact, some are killed by the presence of air. Just\r\nhow these organisms get the oxygen necessary to oxidize their food is not\r\nwell understood. The fact that some bacteria grow without air makes it\r\nnecessary for us to use the one sure weapon we have for their\r\nextermination, and that is heat.\r\n\r\nHeat.--_Experiment._--Take four cultures containing bouillon, inoculate\r\neach tube with bacteria and plug each tube with absorbent cotton. Place one\r\ntube in the ice box, a second tube in a dark closet at a moderate\r\ntemperature, a third in a warm place (about 100 deg. Fahrenheit), and boil the\r\ncontents of the fourth tube for ten minutes, then place it with tube number\r\ntwo. In which tubes does growth take place most rapidly? Why?\r\n\r\nBacteria grow very slowly if at all in the temperature of an ice box, very\r\nrapidly at the room temperature of from 70 deg. to 90 deg. and much less rapidly at\r\na higher temperature. All bacteria except those which have formed spores\r\ncan be instantly killed as soon as boiling point is reached, and most\r\nspores are killed by a few minutes boiling.\r\n\r\nSterilization.--The practical lessons drawn from _sterilization_ are many.\r\nWe know enough now to boil our drinking water if we are uncertain of its\r\npurity; we sterilize any foods that we believe might harbor bacteria, and\r\nthus keep them from spoiling. The industry of canning is built upon the\r\nprinciple of sterilization.\r\n\r\nCanning.--Canning is simply a method by which first the bacteria in a\r\nsubstance are killed by heating and then the substance is put into vessels\r\ninto which no more bacteria may gain entrance. This is usually done at home\r\nby boiling the fruit or vegetable to be canned either in salt and water or\r\nwith sugar and water, either of which substances aids in preventing the\r\ngrowth of bacteria. The time of boiling will be long or short, depending\r\nupon the materials to be canned. Some vegetables, as peas, beans, and corn,\r\nare very difficult to can, probably because of spores of bacteria which may\r\nbe attached to them. Fruits, on the other hand, are usually much easier to\r\npreserve. After boiling for the proper time, the food, now free from all\r\nbacteria, must be put into jars or cans that are themselves absolutely\r\n_sterile_ or free from germs. This is done by first boiling the jars, then\r\npouring the boiling hot material into the hot jars and sealing them so as\r\nto prevent the entrance of bacteria later.\r\n\r\nUses of Canning.--Canning as an industry is of immense importance to\r\nmankind. Not only does it provide him with fruits and vegetables at times\r\nwhen he could not otherwise get them, but it also cheapens the cost of such\r\nthings. It prevents the waste of nature's products at a time when she is\r\nmost lavish with them, enabling man to store them and utilize them later.\r\nCanning has completely changed the life of the sailor and the soldier, who\r\nin former times used to suffer from various diseases caused by lack of a\r\nproper balance of food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pasteurizing milk. Why should this be done?]\r\n\r\nPasteurization.--Milk is one of the most important food supplies of a great\r\ncity. It is also one of the most difficult supplies to get in good\r\ncondition. This is in part due to the fact that milk is produced at long\r\ndistances from the city and must be brought first from farms to the\r\nrailroads, then shipped by train, again taken to the milk supply depot by\r\nwagon, there bottled, and again shipped by delivery wagons to the\r\nconsumers. When we remember that much of the milk used in New York City is\r\nforty-eight hours old and when we realize that bacteria grow _very_ rapidly\r\nin milk, we see the need of finding some way to protect the supply so as to\r\nmake it safe, particularly for babies and young children.\r\n\r\nThis is done by _pasteurization_, a method named after the French\r\nbacteriologist Louis Pasteur. To pasteurize milk we heat it to a\r\ntemperature of not over 170 deg. Fahrenheit for from ten minutes to half an\r\nhour. By such a process all harmful germs will be killed and the keeping\r\nqualities of the milk greatly lengthened. Most large milk companies\r\npasteurize their city supply by a rapid pasteurization at a much higher\r\ntemperature, but this method slightly changes the flavor of the milk.\r\n\r\nCold Storage.--Man has also come to use cold to keep bacteria from growing\r\nin foods. The ice box at home and cold storage on a larger scale enables\r\none to keep foods for a more or less lengthy period. If food is frozen, as\r\nin cold storage, it might keep without growth of bacteria for years. But\r\nfruits and vegetables cannot be frozen without spoiling their flavor. And\r\nall foods after freezing seem particularly susceptible to the bacteria of\r\ndecay. For that reason products taken from cold storage must be used at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nPtomaines.--Many foods get their flavor from the growth of molds or\r\nbacteria in them. Cheese, butter, the gamey taste of certain meats, the\r\nflavor of sauerkraut, are all due to the work of bacteria. But if bacteria\r\nare allowed to grow so as to become very numerous, the ptomaines which\r\nresult from their growth in foods may poison the person eating such foods.\r\nFrequently ptomaine poisoning occurs in the summer time because of the\r\nrapid growth of bacteria. Much of the indigestion and diarrhoea which\r\nattack people during the summer is doubtless due to this kind of poisoning.\r\n\r\nPreservatives.[21]--This leads us to ask if we may not preserve food in\r\nways other than those mentioned so as to protect ourselves from danger of\r\nptomaine poisoning. Many substances check the development of bacteria and\r\nin this way they _preserve_ the food. Preservatives are of two kinds, those\r\nharmless to man and those that are poisonous. Of the former, salt and sugar\r\nare examples; of the latter, formaldehyde and possibly benzoic acid.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 21: Perform experiment here to determine the value\r\n     of different preservatives. Use sugar, salt, vinegar,\r\n     boracic acid, benzoic acid, formaldehyde, and alcohol.\r\n\r\nSugar.--We have noted the use of sugar in canning. Small amounts of sugar\r\nwill be readily attacked by yeasts, molds, and bacteria, but a 40 to 50 per\r\ncent solution will effectually keep out bacteria. Preserves are fruits\r\nboiled in about their own weight of sugar. Condensed milk is preserved by\r\nthe sugar added to it; so are candied and, in part, dried fruits.\r\n\r\nSalt.--Salt has been used for centuries to keep foods. Meats are smoked,\r\ndried, and salted; some are put down in strong salt solutions. Fish,\r\nespecially cod and herring, are dried and salted. The keeping of butter is\r\nalso due to the salt mixed with it. Vinegar is another preservative. It,\r\nlike salt, changes the flavor of materials kept in it and so cannot come\r\ninto wide use. Spices are also used as preservatives.\r\n\r\nHarmful Preservatives.--Certain chemicals and drugs, used as preservatives,\r\nseem to be on the border line of harmfulness. Such are benzoic acid, borax,\r\nor boracic acid. Such drugs _may_ be harmless in small quantities, but\r\nunfortunately in canned goods we do not always know the amount used. The\r\nnational government in 1906 passed what is known as the Pure Food Law,\r\nwhich makes it illegal to use any of these preservatives (excepting benzoic\r\nacid in very small amounts). Food which contains this preservative will be\r\nso labeled and should not be given to children or people with weak\r\ndigestion. Unfortunately people do not always read the labels and thus the\r\npure food law is ineffective in its working. Infrequently formaldehyde or\r\nother preservatives are used in milk. Such treatment renders milk unfit for\r\nordinary use and is an illegal process.\r\n\r\nDisinfectants.[22]--Frequently it becomes necessary to destroy bacteria\r\nwhich cause diseases of various kinds. This process is called\r\n_disinfecting_. The substances commonly used are carbolic acid, formalin or\r\nformaldehyde, lysol, and bichloride of mercury. Of these, the last named is\r\nthe most powerful as well as the most dangerous to use. As it attacks\r\nmetal, it should not be used in a metal pail or dish. It is commonly put up\r\nin tablets which are mixed to form a 1 to 1000 solution. Such tablets\r\nshould be carefully safeguarded because of possible accidental poisoning.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 22: Experiment to determine the most effective\r\n     disinfectants. Use tubes of bouillon containing different\r\n     strength solutions of formaldehyde, lysol, iodine, carbolic\r\n     acid, and bichloride of mercury. Results. Conclusions.\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde used in liquid form is an excellent disinfectant. When burned\r\nin a formalin candle, it sets free an intensely pungent gas which is often\r\nused for disinfecting sick rooms after the patient has been removed.\r\n\r\nCarbolic acid is perhaps the best disinfectant of all. If used in a\r\nsolution of about 1 part to 25 of water, it will not burn the skin. It is\r\nof particular value to disinfect skin wounds, as it heals as well as\r\ncleanses when used in a weak solution. Its rather pleasant odor makes it\r\nuseful to cover up unpleasant smells of the sick room.\r\n\r\nThe fumes of burning sulphur, which are so often used for disinfecting, are\r\nof little real value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This shows how organic matter is broken down by bacteria so\r\nit may be used again by green plants.]\r\n\r\nBacteria cause Decay.--Let us next see in what ways the bacteria directly\r\ninfluence man upon the earth. Have you ever stopped to consider what life\r\nwould be like on the earth if things did not decay? The sea would soon be\r\nfilled and the land covered with dead bodies of plants and animals.\r\nConditions of life would become impossible and living things on the earth\r\nwould cease to exist.\r\n\r\nFortunately, bacteria cause decay. All organic matter, in whatever form, is\r\nsooner or later decomposed by the action of untold millions of bacteria\r\nwhich live in the air, water, and soil. These soil bacteria are most\r\nnumerous in rich damp soils containing large amounts of organic material.\r\nThey are very numerous around and in the dead bodies of plants and animals.\r\nTo a considerable degree, then, these bacteria are useful in feeding upon\r\nthese dead bodies, which otherwise would soon cover the surface of the\r\nearth to the exclusion of everything else. Bacteria may thus be scavengers.\r\nThey oxidize organic materials, changing them to compounds that can be\r\nabsorbed by plants and used in building protoplasm. Without bacteria and\r\nfungi it would be impossible for life to exist on the earth, for green\r\nplants would be unable to get the raw food materials in forms that could be\r\nused in making food and living matter. In this respect bacteria are of the\r\ngreatest service to mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Microscopic appearance of ordinary milk, showing fat\r\nglobules and bacteria which cause the souring of milk.]\r\n\r\nRelation to Fermentation.--They may incidentally, as a result of this\r\nprocess of decay, continue the process of fermentation begun by the yeasts.\r\nIn making vinegar the yeasts first make alcohol (see page 135) which the\r\nbacteria change to acetic acid. The lactic acid bacteria, which sour milk,\r\nchanging the milk sugar to an acid, grow very rapidly in a warm\r\ntemperature; hence milk which is cooled immediately and kept cool or which\r\nis pasteurized and kept in a cool place will not sour readily. Why? These\r\nsame lactic acid bacteria may be useful when they sour the milk for the\r\ncheese maker.\r\n\r\nOther Useful Bacteria.--Certain bacteria give flavor to cheese and butter,\r\nwhile still other bacteria aid in the \"curing\" of tobacco, in the\r\nproduction of the dye indigo, in the preparation of certain fibers of\r\nplants for the market, as hemp, flax, etc., in the rotting of animal matter\r\nfrom the skeletons of sponges, and in the process of tanning hides to make\r\nleather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A field of alfalfa, a plant which harbors the\r\nnitrogen-fixing bacteria.]\r\n\r\nNitrogen-fixing Bacteria.--Still other bacteria, as we have seen before,\r\n\"change over\" nitrogen in organic material in the soil and even the free\r\nnitrogen of the air so that it can be used by plants in the form of a\r\ncompound of nitrogen. The bacteria living in tubercles on the roots of\r\nclover, beans, peas, etc., have the power of thus \"fixing\" the free\r\nnitrogen in the air found between particles of soil. This fact is made use\r\nof by farmers who rotate their crops, growing first a crop of clover or\r\nother plants having root tubercles, which produce the bacteria, then\r\nplowing these in and planting another crop, as wheat or corn, on the same\r\narea. The latter plants, making use of the nitrogen compounds there,\r\nproduce a larger crop than when grown in ground containing less nitrogenous\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nBacteria cause Disease.--The most harmful bacteria are those which cause\r\ndiseases of plants and animals. Certain diseases of plants--blights, rots,\r\nand wilts--are of bacterial nature. These do much annual damage to fruits\r\nand other parts of growing plants useful to man as food. But by far the\r\nmost important are the bacteria which cause disease in man. They accomplish\r\nthis by becoming parasites in the human body. Millions upon millions of\r\nbacteria exist in the human body at all times--in the mouth, on the teeth,\r\nin the blood, and especially in the lower part of the food tube. Some in\r\nthe food tube are believed to be useful, some harmless, and some harmful;\r\nothers in the mouth cause decay of the teeth, while a few kinds, if present\r\nin the body, may cause disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tubercles on the roots of the soy bean. They contain the\r\nnitrogen-fixing bacteria. (Fletcher's Soils.) Copyright by Doubleday, Page\r\nand Company.]\r\n\r\nIt is known that bacteria, like other living things, feed and give off\r\norganic waste from _their own_ bodies. This waste, called a _toxin_, is\r\npoison to the host on which the bacteria live, and it is usually the\r\nproduction of this toxin that causes the symptoms of disease. Some forms,\r\nhowever, break down tissues and plug up the small blood vessels, thus\r\ncausing disease.\r\n\r\nDiseases caused by Bacteria.--It is estimated that bacteria cause annually\r\nover 50 per cent of the deaths of the human race. As we will later see, a\r\nvery large proportion of these diseases might be prevented if people were\r\neducated sufficiently to take the proper precautions to prevent their\r\nspread. These precautions might save the lives of some 3,000,000 of people\r\nyearly in Europe and America. Tuberculosis, typhoid fever, diphtheria,\r\npneumonia, blood poisoning, syphilis, and a score of other germ diseases\r\nought not to exist. A good deal more than half of the present misery of\r\nthis world might be prevented and this earth made cleaner and better by the\r\ncooperation of the young people now growing up to be our future home\r\nmakers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A single cell scraped from the roof of the mouth and highly\r\nmagnified. The little dots are bacteria, most of which are harmless. Notice\r\nthe comparative size of bacteria and cell.]\r\n\r\nHow we take Germ Diseases.--Germ or contagious diseases either enter the\r\nbody by way of the mouth, nose, or other body openings, or through a break\r\nin the skin. They may be carried by means of air, food, or water, but are\r\nusually _transmitted directly_ from the person who has the disease to a\r\nwell person. This may be done through personal contact or by handling\r\narticles used by the sick person or by drinking or eating foods which have\r\nreceived some of the germs. From this it follows that if we know the\r\nmethods by which a given disease is communicated, we may protect ourselves\r\nfrom it and aid the civic authorities in preventing its spread.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Deaths from tuberculosis compared with other contagious\r\ndiseases in the city of New York in 1908.]\r\n\r\nTuberculosis.--The one disease responsible for the greatest number of\r\ndeaths--perhaps one seventh of the total on the globe--is tuberculosis. It\r\nis estimated that of all people alive in the United States to-day,\r\n5,000,000 will die of this disease. But this disease is slowly but surely\r\nbeing overcome. It is believed that within perhaps one hundred years, with\r\nthe aid of good laws and sanitary living, it will be almost extinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This curve shows a decreasing death rate from tuberculosis.\r\nExplain.]\r\n\r\nTuberculosis is caused by the growth of bacteria, called the _tubercle\r\nbacilli_, within the lungs or other tissues of the human body. Here they\r\nform little tubers full of germs, which close up the delicate air passages\r\nin the lungs, while in other tissues they give rise to hip-joint disease,\r\nscrofula, lupus, and other diseases, depending on the part of the body they\r\nattack. Tuberculosis may be contracted by taking the bacteria into the\r\nthroat or lungs or possibly by eating meat or drinking milk from tubercular\r\ncattle. Especially is it communicated from a consumptive to a well person\r\nby kissing, by drinking or eating from the same cup or plate, using the\r\nsame towels, or in coming in direct contact with the person having the\r\ngerms in his body. Although there are always some of the germs in the air\r\nof an ordinary city street, and though we may take some of these germs into\r\nour bodies at any time, yet the bacteria seem able to gain a foothold only\r\nunder certain conditions. It is only when the tissues are in a worn-out\r\ncondition, when we are \"run down,\" as we say, that the parasite may obtain\r\na foothold in the lungs. Even if the disease gets a foothold, it is quite\r\npossible to cure it if it is taken in time. The germ of tuberculosis is\r\nkilled by exposure to bright sunlight and fresh air. Thus the course of the\r\ndisease may be arrested, and a permanent cure brought about, by a life in\r\nthe open air, the patient sleeping out of doors, taking plenty of\r\nnourishing food and very little exercise. See also Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This figure shows how sewage from a cesspool (_c_) might get\r\ninto the water supply: _lm_, layer of rock; _w_, wash water.]\r\n\r\nTyphoid Fever.--One of the most common germ diseases in this country and\r\nEurope is typhoid fever. This is a disease which is conveyed by means of\r\nwater and food, especially milk, oysters, and uncooked vegetables. Typhoid\r\nfever germs live in the intestine and from there get into the blood and are\r\ncarried to all parts of the body. A poison which they give off causes the\r\nfever so characteristic of the disease. The germs multiply very rapidly in\r\nthe intestine and are passed off from the body with the excreta from the\r\nfood tube. If these germs get into the water supply of a town, an epidemic\r\nof typhoid will result. Among the recent epidemics caused by the use of\r\nwater containing typhoid germs have been those in Butler, Pa., where 1364\r\npersons were made ill; Ithaca, N. Y., with 1350 cases; and Watertown, N.\r\nY., where over 5000 cases occurred. Another source of infection is milk.\r\nFrequently epidemics have occurred which were confined to users of milk\r\nfrom a certain dairy. Upon investigation it was found that a case of\r\ntyphoid had occurred on the farm where the milk came from, that the germs\r\nhad washed into the well, and that this water was used to wash the milk\r\ncans. Once in the milk, the bacteria multiplied rapidly, so that the\r\nmilkman gave out cultures of typhoid in his milk bottles. Proper\r\nsafeguarding of our water and milk supply is necessary if we are to keep\r\ntyphoid away.\r\n\r\nBlood Poisoning.--The bacterium causing blood poisoning is another\r\ntoxin-forming germ. It lives in dust and dirt and is often found on the\r\nskin. It enters the body through cuts or bruises. It seems to thrive best\r\nin less oxygen than is found in the air. It is therefore important not to\r\nclose up with court-plaster wounds which such germs may have entered. It,\r\nwith typhoid, is responsible for four times as many deaths as bullets and\r\nshells in time of battle. The wonderfully small death rate of the Japanese\r\narmy in their war with Russia was due to the fact that the Japanese\r\nsoldiers always boiled their drinking water before using it, and their\r\nsurgeons always dressed all wounds on the battlefield, using powerful\r\nantiseptics in order to kill any bacteria that might have lodged in the\r\nexposed wounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This figure shows how a milk route might be instrumental in\r\nspreading diphtheria. _X_ is a farm on which a case of diphtheria occurred\r\nthat was responsible for all the cases along milk routes _A_ and _F_ in\r\nHyde Park, Dorchester, and Milton. How would you explain this?]\r\n\r\nOther Diseases.--Many other diseases have been traced to bacteria.\r\nDiphtheria is one of the best known. As it is a throat disease, it may\r\neasily be conveyed from one person to another by kissing, putting into the\r\nmouth objects which have come in contact with the mouth of the patient, or\r\nby food into which the germs have been carried. Another disease which\r\nprobably causes more misery in the world than any other germ disease is\r\nsyphilis. Hundreds of thousands of new-born babies die annually or grow up\r\nhandicapped by deformities from this dread scourge. Syphilis and gonorrhea,\r\nboth diseases of the same sort and contracted in the same manner, hand down\r\nto innocent wives and still more innocent children a heritage of disease\r\n\"even unto the third and fourth generation.\" Grippe, pneumonia, whooping\r\ncough, and colds are believed to be caused by bacteria. Other diseases, as\r\nmalaria, yellow fever, sleeping sickness, and probably smallpox, scarlet\r\nfever, and measles, are due to the attack of one-celled animal parasites.\r\nOf these we shall learn later in Chapter XV.\r\n\r\nImmunity.--It has been found that after an attack of a germ disease the\r\nbody will not soon be again attacked by the same disease. This immunity, of\r\nwhich we will learn more later, seems to be due to a manufacture in the\r\nblood of substances which fight the bacteria or their poisons. If a person\r\nkeeps his body in good physical condition and lives carefully, he will do\r\nmuch toward acquiring this natural immunity.\r\n\r\nAcquired Immunity.--Modern medicine has discovered means of protecting the\r\nbody from some contagious diseases. Vaccination as protection against\r\nsmallpox, the use of antitoxins (of which more later) against diphtheria,\r\nand inoculation against typhoid are all ways in which we may be protected\r\nagainst diseases.\r\n\r\nMethods of fighting Germ Diseases.--As we have seen, diseases produced by\r\nbacteria may be caused by the bacteria being _directly_ transferred from\r\none person to another, or the disease may obtain a foothold in the body\r\nfrom food, water, or by taking them into the blood through a cut or a wound\r\nor a body opening.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that as individuals we may each do something to prevent the\r\nspread of germ diseases, especially in our homes. We may keep our bodies,\r\nespecially our hands and faces, clean. Sweeping and dusting may be done\r\nwith damp cloths so as not to raise a dust; our milk and water, when from a\r\nsuspicious supply, may be _sterilized_ or pasteurized. Wounds through which\r\nbacteria might obtain foothold in the body should be washed with some\r\n_antiseptic_ such as carbolic acid (1 part to 25 water), which kills the\r\ngerms. In a later chapter we shall learn more of how we may cooperate with\r\nthe authorities to combat disease and make our city or town a better place\r\nin which to live.[23]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 23: Teachers may take up parts or all of Chapter\r\n     XXIV at this point.

THE RELATIONS OF PLANTS TO ANIMALS\r\n\r\n_Problems.--To determine the general biological relations existing between\r\n            plants and animals._\r\n          _(a) As shown in a balanced aquarium._\r\n          _(b) As shown in hay infusion._\r\n\r\n                   SUGGESTIONS FOR LABORATORY WORK\r\n\r\n     _Demonstration of life in a \"balanced\" and \"unbalanced\"\r\n       aquarium._--Determination of factors causing balance.\r\n     _Demonstration of hay infusion._--Examination to show forms of animal\r\n       and plant life.\r\n     Tabular comparison between balanced aquarium and hay infusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Ways in which Plants affect Animals.--We have been studying the life\r\nof plants in order better to understand the life of animals and men. We\r\nhave seen first that green plants play indirectly a tremendous part in\r\nman's welfare by supplying him with food. We have found that the colorless\r\nplants directly affected his welfare by causing disease, and by causing\r\ndecay, thus making usable the nitrogen locked up in dead bodies of plants\r\nand animals, and by some even supplying nitrogen from the atmosphere. The\r\ndependence of animals upon plants has been shown and the interdependence of\r\nplants on animals has also been seen in cross-pollination and in the supply\r\nof raw food materials to plants by animals.\r\n\r\nStudy of a Balanced Aquarium.--Perhaps the best way for us to understand\r\nthe interrelation between plants and animals is to study an aquarium in\r\nwhich plants and animals live and in which a balance has been established\r\nbetween the plant life on one side and animal life on the other. Aquaria\r\ncontaining green pond weeds, either floating or rooted, a few snails, some\r\ntiny animals known as water fleas, and a fish or two will, if kept near a\r\nlight window, show this relation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A balanced aquarium. Explain the term \"balanced.\"]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that green plants under favorable conditions of sunlight,\r\nheat, moisture, and with a supply of raw food materials, give off oxygen as\r\na by-product while manufacturing food in their green cells. We know the\r\nnecessary raw materials for starch manufacture are carbon dioxide and\r\nwater, while nitrogenous material is necessary for the making of proteins\r\nwithin the plant. In previous experiments we have proved that carbon\r\ndioxide is given off by any living thing when oxidation occurs in the body.\r\nThe crawling snails and the swimming fish give off carbon dioxide, which is\r\ndissolved in the water; the plants themselves, at all times, oxidize food\r\nwithin their bodies, and so must _pass off_ some carbon dioxide. The green\r\nplants in the daytime _use up_ the carbon dioxide obtained from the various\r\nsources and, with the water taken in, manufacture starch. While this\r\nprocess is going on, oxygen is given off to the water of the aquarium, and\r\nthis free oxygen is used by the animals there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This diagram shows that plants and animals on the earth hold\r\nthe same relation to each other as plants and animals in a balanced\r\naquarium. Explain the diagram in your notebook.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The carbon and oxygen cycle in the balanced aquarium. Trace\r\nby means of the arrows the carbon from the time plants take it in as CO{2}\r\nuntil animals give it off. Show what happens to the oxygen.]\r\n\r\nBut the plants are continually growing larger. The snails and fish, too,\r\neat parts of the plants. Thus the plant life gives food to the animals\r\nwithin the aquarium. The animals give off certain nitrogenous wastes of\r\nwhich we shall learn more later. These materials, with other nitrogenous\r\nmatter from the dead parts of the plants or animals, form part of the raw\r\nmaterial used for protein manufacture in the plant. This nitrogenous matter\r\nis prepared for use by several different kinds of bacteria which first\r\nbreak the dead bodies down and then give it to the plants in the form of\r\nsoluble nitrates. The green plants manufacture food, the animals eat the\r\nplants and give off organic waste, from which the plants in turn make their\r\nfood and living matter. The plants give off oxygen to the animals, and the\r\nanimals give carbon dioxide to the plants. Thus a balance exists between\r\nthe plants and animals in the aquarium. Make a table to show this balance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The relations between green plants and animals.]\r\n\r\nRelations between Green Plants and Animals.--What goes on in the aquarium\r\nis an example of the relation existing between all green plants and all\r\nanimals. Everywhere in the world green plants are making food which\r\nbecomes, sooner or later, the food of animals. Man does not feed to a great\r\nextent upon leaves, but he eats roots, stems, fruits, and seeds. When he\r\ndoes not feed directly upon plants, he eats the flesh of plant eating\r\nanimals, which in turn feed directly upon plants. And so it is the world\r\nover; the plants are the food makers and supply the animals. Green plants\r\nalso give a very considerable amount of oxygen to the atmosphere every day,\r\nwhich the animals may use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The nitrogen cycle. Trace the nitrogen from its source in\r\nthe air until it gets back again into the air.]\r\n\r\nThe Nitrogen Cycle.--The animals in their turn supply much of the carbon\r\ndioxide that the plant uses in starch making. They also supply some of the\r\nnitrogenous matter used by the plants, part being given the plants from the\r\ndead bodies of their own relatives and part being prepared from the\r\nnitrogen of the air through the agency of bacteria, which live upon the\r\nroots of certain plants. These bacteria are the only organisms that can\r\ntake nitrogen from the air. Thus, in spite of all the nitrogen of the\r\natmosphere, plants and animals are limited in the amount available. And the\r\navailable supply is used over and over again, perhaps in nitrogenous food\r\nby an animal, then it may be given off as organic waste, get into the soil,\r\nand be taken up by a plant through the roots. Eventually the nitrogen forms\r\npart of the food supply in the body of the plant, and then may become part\r\nof its living matter. When the plant dies, the nitrogen is returned to the\r\nsoil. Thus the usable nitrogen is kept in circulation.[24]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 24: A small amount of nitrogen gas is returned to\r\n     the atmosphere by the action of the decomposing bacteria on\r\n     the ammonia compounds in the soil. (See figure of nitrogen\r\n     cycle.)\r\n\r\nSymbiosis.--We have seen that in the balanced aquarium the animals and\r\nplants, in a wide sense, form a sort of unconscious partnership. _This\r\nprocess of living together for mutual advantage is called symbiosis._ Some\r\nanimals thus combine with plants; for example, the tiny animal known as the\r\nhydra with certain of the one-celled algae, and, if we accept the term in a\r\nwide sense, all green plants and animals live in this relation of mutual\r\ngive and take. Animals also frequently live in this relation to each other,\r\nas the crab, which lives within the shell of the oyster; the sea anemones,\r\nwhich are carried around on the backs of some hermit crabs, aiding the crab\r\nin protecting it from its enemies, and being carried about by the crab to\r\nplaces where food is plentiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Life in the late stage of a hay infusion. _B_, bacteria,\r\nswimming or forming masses of food upon which the one-celled animals, the\r\nparamoecia, are feeding; _G_, gullet; _F.V._, food vacuole; _C.V._,\r\ncontractile vacuole; _P_, pleurococcus; _P.D._, pleurococcus dividing.\r\n(Drawn from nature by J. W. Teitz.)]\r\n\r\nA Hay Infusion.--Still another example of the close relation between plants\r\nand animals may be seen in the study of a hay infusion. If we place a wisp\r\nof hay or straw in a small glass jar nearly full of water, and leave it for\r\na few days in a warm room, certain changes are seen to take place in the\r\ncontents of the jar; after a little while the water gets cloudy and darker\r\nin color, and a scum appears on the surface. If some of this scum is\r\nexamined under the compound microscope, it will be found to consist almost\r\nentirely of bacteria. These bacteria evidently aid in the decay which (as\r\nthe unpleasant odor from the jar testifies) is beginning to take place. As\r\nwe have learned, bacteria flourish wherever the food supply is abundant.\r\nThe water within the jar has come to contain much of the food material\r\nwhich was once within the leaves of the grass,--organic nutrients, starch,\r\nsugar, and proteins, formed in the leaf by the action of the sun on the\r\nchlorophyll of the leaf, and now released into the water by the breaking\r\ndown of the walls of the cells of the leaves. The bacteria themselves\r\nrelease this food from the hay by causing it to decay. After a few days\r\nsmall one-celled animals appear; these multiply with wonderful rapidity, so\r\nthat in some cases the surface of the water seems to be almost white with\r\nactive one-celled forms of life. If we ask ourselves where these animals\r\ncome from, we are forced to the conclusion that they must have been in the\r\nwater, in the air, or on the hay. Hay is dried grass and may have been cut\r\nin a field near a pool containing these creatures. When the pool dried up,\r\nthe wind may have scattered some of these little organisms in the dried mud\r\nor dust. Some may have existed in a dormant state on the hay and the water\r\nawakened them to active life. In the water, too, there may have been some\r\nliving cells, plants and animals.\r\n\r\nAt first the multiplication of the tiny animals within the hay infusion is\r\nextremely rapid; there is food in abundance and near at hand. After a few\r\ndays more, however, several kinds of one-celled animals may appear, some of\r\nwhich prey upon others. Consequently a struggle for life takes place, which\r\nbecomes more and more intense as the food from the hay is used up.\r\nEventually the end comes for all the animals unless some green plants\r\nobtain a foothold within the jar. If such a thing happens, food will be\r\nmanufactured within their bodies, a new food supply arises for the animals\r\nwithin the jar, and a balance of life may result.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

Laboratory\r\n       demonstration of fission.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pleurococcus. A very simple plant cell.]\r\n\r\nThe Simplest Plants.--We have seen that perhaps the simplest plant would be\r\nexemplified by one of the tiny bacteria we have just read about. A typical\r\none-celled plant, however, would contain green coloring matter or\r\nchlorophyll, and would have the power to manufacture its own food under\r\nconditions giving it a moderate temperature, a supply of water, oxygen,\r\ncarbon dioxide, and sunlight. Such a simple plant is the _pleurococcus_,\r\nthe \"green slime\" seen on the shady sides of trees, stones, or city houses.\r\nThis plant would meet one definition of a cell, as it is a minute mass of\r\nprotoplasm containing a nucleus. It is surrounded by a wall of a woody\r\nmaterial formed by the activity of the living matter within the cell. It\r\nalso contains a little mass of protoplasm colored green. Of the work of the\r\nchlorophyll in the manufacture of organic food we have already learned.\r\nSuch is a simple plant cell. Let us now examine a simple animal cell in\r\norder to compare it with that of a plant.\r\n\r\nWhere to find Paramoecium.--If we examine very carefully the surface of a\r\nhay infusion, we are likely to notice in addition to the scum formed of\r\nbacteria, a mass of whitish tiny dots collected along the edge of the jar\r\nclose to the surface of the water. More attentive observation shows us that\r\nthese objects move, and that they are never found far from the surface.\r\n\r\nThe Life Habits of Paramoecium.--If we place on a slide a drop of water\r\ncontaining some of these moving objects and examine it under the compound\r\nmicroscope, we find each minute whitish dot is a cell, elongated, oval, or\r\nelliptical in outline and somewhat flattened. This is a one-celled animal\r\nknown as the _paramoecium_ or the slipper animalcule (because of its\r\nshape).\r\n\r\nSeen under the low power of the microscope, it appears to be extremely\r\nactive, rushing about now rapidly, now more slowly, but seemingly always\r\ntaking a definite course. The narrower end of the body (the _anterior_)\r\nusually goes first. If it pushes its way past any dense substance in the\r\nwater, the cell body is seen to change its shape temporarily as it squeezes\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nResponse to Stimuli.--Many of these little creatures may be found collected\r\naround masses of food, showing that they are attracted by it. In another\r\npart of the slide we may find a number of the paramoecia lying close to the\r\nedge of an air bubble with the greatest possible amount of their surface\r\nexposed to its surface. These animals are evidently taking in oxygen by\r\nosmosis. They are breathing. A careful inspection of the jar containing\r\nparamoecia shows thousands of tiny whitish bodies collected near the\r\nsurface of the jar. In the paramoecium, as in the one-celled plants, the\r\nprotoplasm composing the cell responds to certain agencies acting upon it,\r\ncoming from without; these agencies we call _stimuli_. Such stimuli may be\r\nlight, differences of temperature, presence of food, electricity, or other\r\nfactors of its surroundings. Plant and animal cells may react differently\r\nto the same stimulus. In general, however, we know that protoplasm is\r\n_irritable_ to some of these factors. To severe stimuli, protoplasm usually\r\nresponds by _contracting_, another power which it possesses. We know, too,\r\nthat plant and animal cells take in food and change the food to protoplasm,\r\nthat is, that they _assimilate_ food; and that they may waste away and\r\nrepair themselves. Finally, we know that new plant and animal cells are\r\n_reproduced_ from the original bit of protoplasm, a single cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A paramoecium. _c.v._, contractile vacuole; _f.v._, food\r\nvacuole; _m_, mouth; _ma.n._, macronucleus; _mi.n._, micronucleus; _w.v._,\r\nwater vacuole.]\r\n\r\nThe Structure of Paramoecium.--The cell body is almost transparent, and\r\nconsists of semifluid protoplasm which has a granular grayish appearance\r\nunder the microscope. This protoplasm appears to be bounded by a very\r\ndelicate membrane through which project numerous delicate threads of\r\nprotoplasm called _cilia_. (These are usually invisible under the\r\nmicroscope).\r\n\r\nThe locomotion of the paramoecium is caused by the movement of these cilia,\r\nwhich lash the water like a multitude of tiny oars. The cilia also send\r\nparticles of food into a funnel-like opening, the _gullet_, on one side of\r\nthe cell. Once inside the cell body, the particles of food materials are\r\ngathered into little balls within the almost transparent protoplasm. These\r\nmasses of food seem to be inclosed within a little area containing fluid,\r\ncalled a _vacuole_. Other vacuoles appear to be clear; these are spaces in\r\nwhich food has been digested. One or two larger vacuoles may be found;\r\nthese are the _contractile vacuoles_; their purpose seems to be to pass off\r\nwaste material from the cell body. This is done by pulsation of the\r\nvacuole, which ultimately bursts, passing fluid waste to the outside. Solid\r\nwastes are passed out of the cell in somewhat the same manner. No breathing\r\norgans are seen, because osmosis of oxygen and carbon dioxide may take\r\nplace anywhere through the cell membrane. The nucleus of the cell is not\r\neasily visible in living specimens. In a cell that has been stained it has\r\nbeen found to be a double structure, consisting of one large and one small\r\nportion, called, respectively, the _macronucleus_ and the _micronucleus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paramoecium dividing by fission. _M_, mouth; _MAC._,\r\nmacronucleus; _MIC._, micronucleus. (After Sedgwick and Wilson.)]\r\n\r\nReproduction of Paramoecium.--Sometimes a paramoecium may be found in the\r\nact of dividing by the process known as _fission_, to form two new cells,\r\neach of which contains half of the original cell. This is a method of\r\n_asexual_ reproduction. The original cell may thus form in succession many\r\nhundreds of cells in every respect like the original parent cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Amoeba, with pseudopodia (_P._) extended; _EC_, ectoplasm;\r\n_END_, endoplasm; the dark area (_N._) is the nucleus. (From a photograph\r\nloaned by Professor G. N. Calkins.)]\r\n\r\nAmoeba.[25]--In order to understand more fully the life of a simple bit of\r\nprotoplasm, let us take up the study of the _amoeba_, a type of the\r\nsimplest form of animal life. Unlike the plant and animal cells we have\r\nexamined, the amoeba has no fixed form. Viewed under the compound\r\nmicroscope, it has the appearance of an irregular mass of granular\r\nprotoplasm. Its form is constantly changing as it moves about. This is due\r\nto the pushing out of tiny projections of the protoplasm of the cell,\r\ncalled _pseudopodia_ (false feet). The locomotion is accomplished by a\r\nstreaming or flowing of the semifluid protoplasm. The pseudopodia are\r\npushed forward in the direction which the animal is to go, the rest of the\r\nbody following. In the central part of the cell is the nucleus. This\r\nimportant organ is difficult to see except in cells that have been stained.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 25: Amoebae _may_ be obtained from the hay infusion,\r\n     from the dead leaves in the bottom of small pools, from the\r\n     same source in fresh-water aquaria, from the roots of\r\n     duckweed or other small water plants, or from green algae\r\n     growing in quiet localities. No _sure_ method of obtaining\r\n     them can be given.\r\n\r\nAlthough but a single cell, still the amoeba appears to be aware of the\r\nexistence of food when it is near at hand. Food may be taken into the body\r\nat any point, the semifluid protoplasm simply rolling over and engulfing\r\nthe food material. Within the body, as in the paramoecium, the food becomes\r\ninclosed within a fluid space or vacuole. The protoplasm has the power to\r\ntake out such material as it can use to form new protoplasm or give energy.\r\nCirculation of food material is accomplished by the constant streaming of\r\nthe protoplasm within the cell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Amoeba, showing the changes which take place during division\r\nof the cell. The dark body in each figure is the nucleus; the transparent\r\ncircle, the contractile vacuole; the large granular masses, the food\r\nvacuoles. Much magnified.]\r\n\r\nThe cell absorbs oxygen from the water by osmosis through its delicate\r\nmembrane, giving up carbon dioxide in return. Thus the cell \"breathes\"\r\nthrough any part of its body covering.\r\n\r\nWaste nitrogenous products formed within the cell when work is done are\r\npassed out by means of the contractile vacuole.\r\n\r\nThe amoeba, like other one-celled organisms, reproduces by the process of\r\nfission. A single cell divides by splitting into two others, each of which\r\nresembles the parent cell, except that they are of less bulk. When these\r\nbecome the size of the parent amoeba, they each in turn divide. This is a\r\nkind of asexual reproduction.\r\n\r\nWhen conditions unfavorable for life come, the amoeba, like some one-celled\r\nplants, encysts itself within a membranous wall. In this condition it may\r\nbecome dried and be blown through the air. Upon return to a favorable\r\nenvironment, it begins life again, as before. In this respect it resembles\r\nthe spore of a plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vorticella. _e_, gullet; _n_, nucleus; _cv_, contractile\r\nvacuole; _a_, axis; _s_, sheath; _fv_, food vacuole. (From Herrick'_s\r\nGeneral Zoology_.)]\r\n\r\nThe Cell as a Unit.--In the daily life of a one-celled animal we find the\r\nsingle cell performing all the general activities which we shall later find\r\nthe many-celled animal is able to perform. In the amoeba no definite parts\r\nof the cell appear to be set off to perform certain functions; but any part\r\nof the cell can take in food, can absorb oxygen, can change the food into\r\nprotoplasm, and excrete the waste material. The single cell is, in fact, an\r\norganism able to carry on the business of living almost as effectually as a\r\nvery complex animal.\r\n\r\nComplex One-celled Animals.--In the paramoecium we find a single cell, but\r\nwe find certain parts of the cell having certain definite functions: the\r\ncilia are used for locomotion; a definite part of the cell takes in food,\r\nwhile the waste passes out at another definite spot. In another one-celled\r\nanimal called _vorticella_, part of the cell has become elongated and is\r\ncontractile. By this stalk the little animal is fastened to a water plant\r\nor other object. The stalk may be said to act like a muscle fiber, as its\r\nsole function seems to be movement; the cilia are located at one end of the\r\ncell and serve to create a current of water which will bring food particles\r\nto the mouth. Here we have several parts of the cell, each doing a\r\ndifferent kind of work. This is known as _physiological division of labor_.\r\n\r\nHabitat of Protozoa.--Protozoa are found almost everywhere in shallow\r\nwater, especially close to the surface. They appear to be attracted near to\r\nthe surface by the supply of oxygen. Every fresh-water lake swarms with\r\nthem; the ocean contains countless myriads of many different forms.\r\n\r\nUse as Food.--They are so numerous in lakes, rivers, and the ocean as to\r\nform the food for many animals higher in the scale of life. Almost all fish\r\nthat do not take the hook and that travel in schools, or companies,\r\nmigrating from one place to another, live partly on such food. Many feed on\r\nslightly larger animals, which in turn eat the Protozoa. Such fish have on\r\neach side of the mouth attached to the gills a series of small structures\r\nlooking like tiny rakes. These are called the _gill rakers_, and aid in\r\ncollecting tiny organisms from the water as it passes over the gills. The\r\nwhale, the largest of all mammals, strains protozoans and other small\r\nanimals and plants out of the water by means of hanging plates of whalebone\r\nor baleen, the slender filaments of which form a sieve from the top to the\r\nbottom of the mouth.\r\n\r\nProtozoa cause Disease.--Protozoa of certain kinds play an important part\r\nin causing malaria, yellow fever, and other diseases, as we shall see\r\nlater.[26] (See page 217.)\r\n\r\n     Footnote 26: Teachers may find it expedient to take up the\r\n     study of protozoan diseases at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

THE VARIOUS FORMS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS\r\n\r\n_Problems.--The development and forms of plants._\r\n          _The development of a simple animal._\r\n          _What is division of labor? In what does it result?_\r\n          _How to know the chief characters of some great animal groups._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _A visit to a botanical garden or laboratory\r\n       demonstration._--Some of the forms of plant life. Review of\r\n       essential facts in development of bean or corn embryo.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Charts or models showing the development\r\n       of a many-celled animal from egg through gastrula stage.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Types which illustrate increasing\r\n       complexity of body form and division of labor.\r\n     _Museum trip._--To afford pupil a means of identification of\r\n       examples of principal phyla. This should be preceded by\r\n       objective demonstration work in school laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\nReproduction in Plants.--Although there are very many plants and animals so\r\nsmall and so simple as to be composed of but a single cell, by far the\r\ngreater part of the animal and plant world is made up of individuals which\r\nare collections of cells living together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A cell of pond scum. How might it divide to form a long\r\nthread made up of cells?]\r\n\r\nIn a simple plant like the pond scum, a string or filament of cells is\r\nformed by a single cell dividing crosswise, the two cells formed each\r\ndividing into two more. Eventually a long thread of cells is thus formed.\r\nAt times, however, a cell is formed by the union of two cells, one from\r\neach of two adjoining filaments of the plant. At length a hard coat forms\r\naround this cell, which has now become a _spore_. The tough covering\r\nprotects it from unfavorable changes in the surroundings. Later, when\r\nconditions become favorable for its germination, the spore may form a new\r\nfilament of pond scum. In molds, in yeasts, and in the bacteria we also\r\nfound spores could be formed by the protoplasm of the plant cutting up into\r\na number of tiny spores. These spores are called _asexual_ (without sex)\r\nbecause they are not formed by the union of two cells, and may give rise to\r\nother tiny plants like themselves. Still other plants, mosses and ferns,\r\ngive rise to two kinds of spores, sexual and asexual. All of these\r\ncollectively are called _spore plants_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The formation of spores in pond scum. _zs_, zygospore; _f_,\r\nfusion in progress.]\r\n\r\nReproduction in Seed Plants.--Another great group of plants we have\r\nstudied, plants of varied shapes and sizes, produce seeds. They bear\r\nflowers and fruits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The formation and growth of a plant embryo. 1, the sperm and\r\negg cell uniting; 2, a fertilized egg; 3, two cells formed by division; 4,\r\nfour cells formed from two; 5, a many-celled embryo; 6, young plant; _H_,\r\nhypocotyl; _P_, plumule; _C_, cotyledons.]\r\n\r\nThe embryo develops from a single fertilized \"egg,\" growing by cell\r\ndivision into two, four, eight, and a constantly increasing number of cells\r\nuntil after a time a baby plant is formed, which as in the bean, either\r\ncontains some stored food to give it a start in life, or, as in the corn,\r\nis surrounded with food which it can digest and absorb into its own tiny\r\nbody. We have seen that these young plants in the seed are able to develop\r\nwhen conditions are favorable. Furthermore, the young of each kind of plant\r\nwill eventually develop into the kind of plant its parent was and into no\r\nother kind. Thus the plant world is divided into many tribes or groups.\r\n\r\nPlants are placed in Groups.--If we plant a number of peas so that they\r\nwill all germinate under the same conditions of soil, temperature, and\r\nsunlight, the seedlings that develop will each differ one from another in a\r\nslight degree.[27] But in a general way they will have many characters in\r\ncommon, as the shape of the leaves, the possession of tendrils, form of the\r\nflower and fruit. A _species_ of plants or animals is a group of\r\nindividuals so much alike in their characters that they might have had the\r\nsame parents. Individuals of such species differ slightly; for no two\r\nindividuals are exactly alike.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 27: NOTE TO TEACHERS.--A trip to the Botanical\r\n     Garden or to a Museum should be taken at this time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A colony of trilliums, a flowering plant. (Photograph by W.\r\nC. Barbour.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rock fern, _polypody_. Notice the underground stem giving\r\noff roots from its lower surface, and leaves (_C_), (_S_), from its upper\r\nsurface.]\r\n\r\nSpecies are grouped together in a larger group called a genus. For example,\r\nmany kinds of peas--the wild beach peas, the sweet peas, and many\r\nothers--are all grouped in one genus (called _Lathyrus_, or vetchling)\r\nbecause they have certain structural characteristics in common.\r\n\r\nPlant and animal genera are brought together in still larger groups, the\r\nclassification based on general likenesses in structure. Such groups are\r\ncalled, as they become successively larger, _Family_, _Order_, and _Class_.\r\nThus both the plant and animal kingdoms are grouped into divisions, the\r\nsmallest of which contains individuals very much alike; and the largest of\r\nwhich contains very many groups of individuals, the groups having some\r\ncharacters in common. This is called a system of classification.\r\n\r\nClassification of the Plant Kingdom.--The entire plant kingdom has been\r\ndivided into four sub-kingdoms by botanists:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Spermatophytes._ { _Angiosperms_, true flowering plants.\r\n                       { _Gymnosperms_, the pines and their allies.\r\n  2. _Pteridophytes._  The fern plants and their allies.\r\n  3. _Bryophytes._     The moss plants and their allies\r\n  4. _Thallophytes._   The Thallophytes form two groups: the Algae and the\r\n                       Fungi; the algae being green, while the fungi have\r\n                       no chlorophyll.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rockweed, a brown algae, showing its distribution on rocks\r\nbelow highwater mark.]\r\n\r\nThe extent of the plant kingdom can only be hinted at; each year new\r\nspecies are added to the lists. There are about 110,000 species of\r\nflowering plants and nearly as many flowerless plants. The latter consist\r\nof over 3500 species of fernlike plants, some 16,500 species of mosses,\r\nover 5600 lichens (plants consisting of a partnership between algae and\r\nfungi), approximately 55,000 species of fungi, and about 16,000 species of\r\nalgae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A moss plant. _G_, the moss body; _S_, the spore-bearing\r\nstalk (fruiting body).]\r\n\r\nDevelopment of a Simple Animal.--Many-celled animals are formed in much the\r\nsame way as are many-celled seed plants. A common bath sponge, an\r\nearthworm, a fish, or a dog,--each and all of them begin life in the same\r\nmanner. In a many-celled animal the life history begins with a single cell,\r\nthe fertilized egg. As in the flowering plant, this cell has been formed by\r\nthe union of two other cells, a tiny (usually motile) cell; the _sperm_,\r\nand a large cell, the _egg_. After the egg is fertilized by a sperm cell,\r\nit splits into two, four, eight, and sixteen cells; as the number of cells\r\nincreases, a hollow ball of cells called the _blastula_ is formed; later\r\nthis ball sinks in on one side, and a double-walled cup of cells, now\r\ncalled a _gastrula_, results. Practically all animals pass through the\r\nabove stages in their development from the egg, although these stages are\r\noften not plain to see because of the presence of food material (yolk) in\r\nthe egg.\r\n\r\nIn animals the body consists of three layers of cells: those of the\r\noutside, developed from the outer layer of the gastrula, are called\r\n_ectoderm_, which later gives rise to the skin, nervous system, etc.; an\r\ninner layer, developed from the inner layer of the gastrula, the\r\n_endoderm_, which forms the lining of the digestive organs, etc.; a middle\r\nlayer, called the _mesoderm_, lying between the ectoderm and the endoderm,\r\nis also found. In higher animals this layer gives rise to muscles, the\r\nskeleton, and parts of other internal structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stages in the development of a fertilized egg into the\r\ngastrula stage. Read your text, then draw these stages and name each\r\nstage.]\r\n\r\nPhysiological Division of Labor.--If we compare the amoeba and the\r\nparamoecium, we find the latter a more complex organism than the former. An\r\namoeba may take in food through any part of the body; the paramoecium has a\r\ndefinite gullet; the amoeba may use any part of the body for locomotion;\r\nthe paramoecium has definite parts of the cell, the cilia, fitted for this\r\nwork. Since the structure of the paramoecium is more complex, we say that\r\nit is a \"higher\" animal. In the vorticella, a still more complex cell, part\r\nof the cell has grown out like a stalk, has become contractile, and acts\r\nlike muscle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph of a living _vorticella_, showing the contractile\r\nstalk and the cilia around the mouth. Compare this figure with that of the\r\nparamoecium. Which cell shows greater division of labor?]\r\n\r\nAs we look higher in the scale of life, we invariably find that certain\r\nparts of a plant or animal are set apart to do certain work, and only that\r\nwork. Just as in a community of people, there are some men who do rough\r\nmanual work, others who are skilled workmen, some who are shopkeepers, and\r\nstill others who are professional men, so among plants and animals,\r\nwherever _collections_ of cells live together to form an organism, there is\r\ndivision of labor, some cells being fitted to do one kind of work, while\r\nothers are fitted to do work of another sort. This is called physiological\r\ndivision of labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Enlarged lengthwise section of the hydra, a very simple\r\nanimal which shows slight division of labor. _ba_, base; _b_, bud; _m_,\r\nmouth; _ov_, ovary; _sp_, spermary.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Different forms of tissue cells. _C_, bone making cells;\r\n_E_, epithelial cells; _F_, fat cells; _L_, liver cells; _M_, muscle cell;\r\n_i_, involuntary; _v_, voluntary; _N_, nerve cell; _C B_, cell body;\r\n_N.F._, nerve fiber; _T.B._, nerve endings; _W_, colorless blood cells.]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the higher plants are made up of a vast number of cells of\r\nmany kinds. Collections of cells alike in structure and performing the same\r\nfunction we have called a _tissue_. Examples of animal tissues are the\r\nhighly contractile cells set apart for movement, _muscles_; those which\r\ncover the body or line the inner parts of organs, the skin, or\r\n_epithelium_; the cells which form secretions or _glands_ and the sensitive\r\ncells forming the _nervous_ tissues.\r\n\r\nFrequently several tissues have certain functions to perform in conjunction\r\nwith one another. The arm of the human body performs movement. To do this,\r\nseveral tissues, as muscles, nerves, and bones, must act together. A\r\ncollection of tissues performing certain work we call an _organ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of a sponge, showing how cells perform division of\r\nlabor. _ect_, ectoderm; _mes_, mesoderm; _end_, endoderm; _c.c._, ciliated\r\ncells, which take in food by means of their flagellae or large cilia\r\n(_fla_).]\r\n\r\nIn a simple animal like a sponge, division of labor occurs between the\r\ncells; some cells which line the pores leading inward create a current of\r\nwater, and feed upon the minute organisms which come within reach, other\r\ncells build the skeleton of the sponge, and still others become eggs or\r\nsperms. In higher animals more complicated in structure and in which the\r\ntissues are found working together to form organs, division of labor is\r\nmuch more highly specialized. In the human arm, an organ fitted for certain\r\nmovements, think of the number of tissues and the complicated actions which\r\nare possible. The most extreme division of labor is seen in the organism\r\nwhich has the most complex actions to perform and whose organs are fitted\r\nfor such work, for there the cells or tissues which do the particular work\r\ndo it quickly and very well.\r\n\r\nIn our daily life in a town or city we see division of labor between\r\nindividuals. Such division of labor may occur among other animals, as, for\r\nexample, bees or ants. But it is seen at its highest in a great city or in\r\na large business or industry. In the stockyards of Chicago, division of\r\nlabor has resulted in certain men performing but a single movement during\r\ntheir entire day's work, but this movement repeated so many times in a day\r\nhas resulted in wonderful accuracy and speed. Thus division of labor\r\nobtains its end.\r\n\r\nOrgans and Functions Common to All Animals.--The same general functions\r\nperformed by a single cell are performed by a many-celled animal. But in\r\nthe many-celled animals the various functions of the single cell are taken\r\nup by the organs. In a complex organism, like man, the organs and the\r\nfunctions they perform may be briefly given as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) The organs of _food taking_: food may be taken in by individual cells,\r\nas those lining the pores of the sponge, or definite parts of a food tube\r\nmay be set apart for this purpose, as the mouth and parts which place food\r\nin the mouth.\r\n\r\n(2) The organs of _digestion_: the food tube and collections of cells which\r\nform the glands connected with it. The enzymes in the fluids secreted by\r\nthe latter change the foods from a solid form (usually insoluble) to that\r\nof a _fluid_. Such fluid may then pass by osmosis, through the walls of the\r\nfood tube into the blood.\r\n\r\n(3) The organs of _circulation_: the tubes through which the blood, bearing\r\nits organic foods and oxygen, reaches the tissues of the body. In simple\r\nanimals, as the sponge and hydra, no such organs are needed, the fluid food\r\npassing from cell to cell by osmosis.\r\n\r\n(4) The organs of _respiration_: the organs in which the blood receives\r\noxygen and gives up carbon dioxide. The outer layer of the body serves this\r\npurpose in very simple animals; gills or lungs are developed in more\r\ncomplex animals.\r\n\r\n(5) The organs of _excretion_: such as the kidneys and skin, which pass off\r\nnitrogenous and other waste matters from the body.\r\n\r\n(6) The organs of _locomotion_: muscles and their attachments and\r\nconnectives; namely, tendons, ligaments, and bones.\r\n\r\n(7) The organs of _nervous control_: the central nervous system, which has\r\ncontrol of coordinated movement. This consists of scattered cells in low\r\nforms of life; such cells are collected into groups and connected with each\r\nother in higher animals.\r\n\r\n(8) The organs of _sense_: collections of cells having to do with the\r\nreception and transmission of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch,\r\npressure, and temperature sensations.\r\n\r\n(9) The organs of _reproduction_: the sperm and egg-forming organs.\r\n\r\nAlmost all animals have the functions mentioned above. In most, the various\r\norgans mentioned are more or less developed, although in the simpler forms\r\nof animal life some of the organs mentioned above are either very poorly\r\ndeveloped or entirely lacking. But in the so-called \"higher\" animals each\r\nof the above-named functions is assigned to a certain organ or group of\r\norgans. The work is done better and more quickly than in the \"lower\"\r\nanimals. Division of labor is thus a guide in helping us to determine the\r\nplace of animals in the groups that exist on the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Animal Series.--We have found that a one-celled animal can perform\r\ncertain functions in a rather crude manner. Man can perform these same\r\nfunctions in an extremely efficient manner. Division of labor is well\r\nworked out, extreme complexity of structure is seen. Between these two\r\nextremes are a great many groups of animals which can be arranged more or\r\nless as a series, showing the gradual evolution or development of life on\r\nthe earth. It will be the purpose of the following pages to show the chief\r\ncharacteristics of the great groups of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The glasslike skeleton of a _radiolarian_, a protozoan.\r\n(From model at American Museum of Natural History.)]\r\n\r\nI. Protozoa.--Animals composed of a single cell, reproducing by cell\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal classes of Protozoa, examples of which we\r\nmay have seen or read about:--\r\n\r\nCLASS I. _Rhizopoda_ (Greek for _root-footed_). Having no fixed form, with\r\npseudopodia. Either naked as _Amoeba_ or building limy (_Foraminifera_) or\r\nglasslike skeletons (_Radiolaria_).\r\n\r\nCLASS II. _Infusoria (in infusions)._ Usually active ciliated Protozoa.\r\nExamples, _Paramoecium_, _Vorticella_.\r\n\r\nCLASS III. _Sporozoa (spore animals)._ Parasitic and usually nonactive.\r\nExample, _Plasmodium malariae_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A horny fiber sponge. Notice that it is a\r\ncolony. One fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\nII. Sponges.--Because the body contains many pores through which water\r\nbearing food particles enters, these animals are called _Porifera_. They\r\nare classed according to the skeleton they possess into limy, glasslike,\r\nand horny fiber sponges. The latter are the sponges of commerce. With but\r\nfew exceptions sponges live in salt water and are never free swimming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sea anemones. One half natural size. The right hand specimen\r\nis expanded and shows the mouth surrounded by the tentacles. The left hand\r\nspecimen is contracted. (From model at the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory.)]\r\n\r\nIII. Coelenterates.--The hydra and its salt-water allies, the jellyfish,\r\nhydroids, and corals, belong to a group of animals known as the\r\n_Coelenterata_. The word \"coelenterate\" (_coelom_ = body cavity, _enteron_\r\n= food tube) explains the structure of the group. They are animals in which\r\nthe real body cavity is lacking, the animal in its simplest form being\r\nlittle more than a bag. Some examples are the hydra, shown on page 179,\r\nsalt-water forms known as hydroids, colonial forms which have part of their\r\nlife free swimming as jellyfish; sea anemones and coral polyps, tiny\r\ncolonial hydra like forms which build a living or secreted covering.\r\n\r\nIV. Worms.--The wormlike animals are grouped into _flatworms_,\r\n_roundworms_, and segmented or _jointed_ worms.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Flatworms are sometimes parasitic, examples being the tapeworm and\r\nliver fluke. They are usually small, ribbon- or leaf-like and flat and live\r\nin water.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Roundworms, minute threadlike creatures, are not often seen by the\r\ncity girl or boy. Vinegar eels, the horsehair worm, the pork worm or\r\ntrichina and the dread hookworm are examples.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Segmented worms are long, jointed creatures composed of body rings or\r\nsegments. Examples are the earthworm, the sandworm (known to New York boys\r\nas the fishworm), and the leeches or bloodsuckers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A jointed worm. The sandworm. Slightly reduced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The common starfish seen from below to show the tube feet.\r\nAbout one half natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The crayfish, a crustacean. _A_, antenna; _M_, mouth; _E_,\r\ncompound stalked eye; _Ch_, pincher claw; _C.P._, cephalothorax; _Ab_,\r\nabdomen; _C.F._, caudal fin. A little reduced.]\r\n\r\nV. Echinoderms.--These are spiny-skinned animals, which live in salt water.\r\nThey are still more complicated in structure than the worms and may be\r\nknown by the spines in their skin. They show radial symmetry. Starfish or\r\nsea urchins are examples.\r\n\r\nVI. Arthropods.--These animals are distinguished by having jointed body and\r\nlegs. They form two great groups. The higher forms of the _Crustacea_ have\r\nonly two regions in the body, a fused head and thorax, called the\r\n_cephalothorax_, and an abdominal region. A second group is the _Insecta_,\r\nof which we know something already. Crustacea breathe by means of _gills_,\r\nwhich are structures for taking oxygen out of the water, while adult\r\ninsects breathe through air tubes called _trachea_.\r\n\r\nTwo smaller groups of arthropods also exist, the _Arachnida_, consisting of\r\nspiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites, and the _Myriapoda_, examples being\r\nthe \"thousand leggers\" found in some city houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A common snail, a mollusk. (From a photograph by Davison.)]\r\n\r\nVII. Mollusca.--Another large group is the Mollusca. This phylum gets its\r\nname from the soft, unsegmented body (_mollis_ = soft). Mollusks usually\r\nhave a shell, which may be of one piece, as a snail, or two pieces or\r\n_valves_, as the clam or oyster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The skeleton of a dog; a typical vertebrate.]\r\n\r\nVIII. The Vertebrates.--All of the animals we have studied thus far agree\r\nin having whatever skeleton or hard parts they possess on the outside of\r\nthe body. Collectively, they are called _Invertebrates_. This exoskeleton\r\ndiffers from the main or axial skeleton of the higher animals, the latter\r\nbeing inside of the body. The exoskeleton is dead, being secreted by the\r\ncells lining the body, while the endoskeleton is, in part at least, alive\r\nand is capable of growth, _e.g._ a broken arm or leg bone will grow\r\ntogether. But a man has certain parts of the skeleton, as nails or hair,\r\nformed by the skin and in addition possesses inside bones to which the\r\nmuscles are attached. Some of the bones are arranged in a flexible column\r\nin the _dorsal_ (the back) side of the body. This _vertebral column_, as it\r\nis called, is distinctive of all _vertebrates_. Within its bony protection\r\nlies the delicate central nervous system, and to this column are attached\r\nthe big bones of the legs and arms. The vertebrate animals deserve more of\r\nour attention than other forms of life because man himself is a vertebrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The sand shark, an elasmobranch. Note the slits leading from\r\nthe gills. (From a photograph loaned by the American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory.)]\r\n\r\nFive groups or classes of vertebrates exist. _Fishes_, _Amphibians_,\r\n_Reptiles_, _Birds_, and _Mammals_. Let us see how to distinguish one class\r\nfrom another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The sturgeon, a ganoid fish.]\r\n\r\nFishes.--Fishes are familiar animals to most of us. We know that they live\r\nin the water, have a backbone, and that they have fins. They breathe by\r\nmeans of gills, delicate organs fitted for taking oxygen out of the water.\r\nThe heart has two chambers, an auricle and a ventricle. They have a skin in\r\nwhich are glands secreting mucus, a slimy substance which helps them go\r\nthrough the water easily. They usually lay very many eggs.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF FISHES\r\n\r\n     ORDER I. _The Elasmobranchs._ Fishes which have a soft skeleton made\r\n     of cartilage and exposed gill slits. Examples: sharks, skates, and\r\n     rays.\r\n\r\n     ORDER II. _The Ganoids._ Fishes which once were very numerous on the\r\n     earth, but which are now almost extinct. They are protected by\r\n     platelike scales. Examples: gars, sturgeon, and bowfin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A bony fish.]\r\n\r\n     ORDER III. _The Teleosts, or Bony Fishes._ They compose 95 per cent of\r\n     all living fishes. In this group the skeleton is bony, the gills are\r\n     protected by an operculum, and the eggs are numerous. Most of our\r\n     common food fishes belong to this class.\r\n\r\n     ORDER IV. _The Dipnoi, or Lung Fishes._ This is a very small group. In\r\n     many respects they are more like amphibians than fishes, the swim\r\n     bladder being used as a lung. They live in tropical Africa, South\r\n     America, and Australia, inhabiting the rivers and lakes there.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of Amphibia.--The frog belongs to the class of vertebrates\r\nknown as Amphibia. As the name indicates (_amphi_, both, and _bia_, life),\r\nmembers of this group live both in water and on land. In the earlier stages\r\nof their development they take oxygen into the blood by means of gills.\r\nWhen adult, however, they breathe by means of lungs. At all times, but\r\nespecially during the winter, the skin serves as a breathing organ. The\r\nskin is soft and unprotected by bony plates or scales. The heart has three\r\nchambers, two auricles and one ventricle. Most amphibians undergo a\r\ncomplete metamorphosis, or change of form, the young being unlike the\r\nadults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Newt. (From a photograph loaned by the American Museum of\r\nNatural History.) About natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The leopard frog, an amphibian.]\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF AMPHIBIA\r\n\r\n      ORDER I. _Urodela._ Amphibia having usually poorly developed\r\n      appendages. Tail persistent through life. Examples: mud puppy, newt,\r\n      salamander.\r\n\r\n      ORDER II. _Anura._ Tailless Amphibia, which undergo a metamorphosis,\r\n      breathing by gills in larval state, by lungs in adult state.\r\n      Examples: toad and frog.\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of Reptilia.--These animals are characterized by having\r\nscales developed from the skin. In the turtle they have become bony and are\r\nconnected with the internal skeleton. Reptiles always breathe by means of\r\nlungs, differing in this respect from the amphibians. They show their\r\ndistant relationship to birds in that their large eggs are incased in a\r\nleathery, limy shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box tortoise, a land reptile. (From photograph loaned by the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History.) About one fourth natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The gila monster, a poisonous lizard. About one twelfth\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF REPTILES\r\n\r\n     ORDER I. _Chelonia_ (turtles and tortoises). Flattened reptiles with\r\n     body inclosed in bony case. No teeth or sternum (breastbone).\r\n     Examples: snapping turtle, box tortoise.\r\n\r\n     ORDER II. _Lacertilia_ (lizards). Body covered with scales, usually\r\n     having two-paired appendages. Breathe by lungs. Examples: fence\r\n     lizard, horned toad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The common garter snake. Reduced to about one tenth natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n     ORDER III. _Ophidia_ (snakes). Body elongated, covered with scales. No\r\n     limbs present. Examples: garter snake, rattlesnake.\r\n\r\n     ORDER IV. _Crocodilia._ Fresh-water reptiles with elongated body and\r\n     bony scales on skin. Two-paired limbs. Examples: alligator, crocodile.\r\n\r\nBirds.--Birds among all other animals are known by their covering of\r\nfeathers and the presence of wings. The feathers are developed from the\r\nskin. These aid in flight, and protect the body from the cold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Adaptations in the bills of birds. Could we tell anything\r\nabout the food of a bird from its bill? Do these birds all get their food\r\nin the same manner? Do they all eat the same kind of food?]\r\n\r\nThe form of the bill in particular shows adaptation to a wonderful degree.\r\nA duck has a flat bill for pushing through the mud and straining out the\r\nfood; a bird of prey has a curved or hooked beak for tearing; the\r\nwoodpecker has a sharp, straight bill for piercing the bark of trees in\r\nsearch of the insect larvae which are hidden underneath. Birds do not have\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Common tern and young, showing nesting and feeding habits.\r\n(From group at American Museum of Natural History.)]\r\n\r\nThe rate of respiration, of heartbeat, and the body temperature are all\r\nhigher in the bird than in man. Man breathes from twelve to fourteen times\r\nper minute. Birds breathe from twenty to sixty times a minute. Because of\r\nthe increased activity of a bird, there comes a necessity for a greater and\r\nmore rapid supply of oxygen, an increased blood supply to carry the\r\nmaterial to be used up in the release of energy, and a means of rapid\r\nexcretion of the wastes resulting from the process of oxidation. Birds are\r\nlarge eaters, and the digestive tract is fitted to digest the food quickly,\r\nby having a large crop in which food may be stored in a much softened\r\ncondition. As soon as the food is part of the blood, it may be sent rapidly\r\nto the places where it is needed, by means of the large four-chambered\r\nheart and large blood vessels.\r\n\r\nThe high temperature of the bird is a direct result of this rapid\r\noxidation; furthermore, the feathers and the oily skin form an insulation\r\nwhich does not readily permit of the escape of heat. This insulating cover\r\nis of much use to the bird in its flights at high altitudes, where the\r\ntemperature is often very low. Birds lay eggs and usually care for their\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: African ostrich, one of the largest living birds.]\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF BIRDS\r\n\r\nORDER I. _Cursores._ Running birds with no keeled breastbone. Examples:\r\nostrich, cassowary.\r\n\r\nORDER II. _Passeres._ Perching birds; three toes in front, one behind. Over\r\none half of all species of birds are included in this order. Examples:\r\nsparrow, thrush, swallow.\r\n\r\nORDER III. _Gallinae._ Strong legs; feet adapted to scratching. Beak stout.\r\nExamples: jungle fowl, grouse, quail, domestic fowl.\r\n\r\nORDER IV. _Raptores._ Birds of prey. Hooked beak. Strong claws. Examples:\r\neagle, hawk, owl.\r\n\r\nORDER V. _Grallatores._ Waders. Long neck, beak, and legs. Examples: snipe,\r\ncrane, heron.\r\n\r\nORDER VI. _Natatores._ Divers and swimmers. Legs short, toes webbed.\r\nExamples: gull, duck, albatross.\r\n\r\nORDER VII. _Columbinae._ Like Gallinae, but with weaker legs. Examples: dove,\r\npigeon.\r\n\r\nORDER VIII. _Pici._ Woodpeckers. Two toes point forward, two backward, and\r\nadaptation for climbing. Long, strong bill.\r\n\r\nORDER IX. _Psittaci._ Parrots, hooked beak and fleshy tongue.\r\n\r\nORDER X. _Coccyges._ Climbing birds, with powerful beak. Examples:\r\nkingfisher, toucan, and cuckoo.\r\n\r\nORDER XI. _Macrochires._ Birds having long-pointed wings, without scales on\r\nmetatarsus. Examples: swift, humming bird, and goatsucker.\r\n\r\nMammals.--Dogs and cats, sheep and pigs, horses and cows, all of our\r\ndomestic animals (and man himself) have characters of structure which cause\r\nthem to be classed as mammals. They, like some other vertebrates, have\r\nlungs and warm blood. They also have a hairy covering and bear young\r\ndeveloped to a form similar to their own,[28] and nurse them with milk\r\nsecreted by glands known as the _mammary glands_; hence the term \"mammal.\"\r\n\r\n     Footnote 28: With the exception of the monotremes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The bison, an almost extinct mammal.]\r\n\r\nAdaptations in Mammalia.--Of the thirty-five hundred species, most inhabit\r\ncontinents; a few species are found on different islands, and some, as the\r\nwhale, inhabit the ocean. They vary in size from the whale and the elephant\r\nto tiny shrew mice and moles. Adaptations to different habitat and methods\r\nof life abound; the seal and whale have the limbs modified into flippers,\r\nthe sloth and squirrel have limbs peculiarly adapted to climbing, while the\r\nbats have the fore limbs modeled for flight.\r\n\r\nLowest Mammals.--The lowest are the monotremes, animals which lay eggs like\r\nthe birds, although they are provided with hairy covering like other\r\nmammals. Such are the Australian spiny anteater and the duck mole.\r\n\r\nAll other mammals bring forth their young developed to a form similar to\r\ntheir own. The kangaroo and opossum, however, are provided with a pouch on\r\nthe under side of the body in which the very immature, blind, and helpless\r\nyoung are nourished until they are able to care for themselves. These\r\npouched animals are called _marsupials_.\r\n\r\nThe other mammals may be briefly classified as follows:--\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF HIGHER MAMMALS\r\n\r\nORDER I. _Edentata._ Toothless or with very simple teeth. Examples:\r\nanteater, sloth, armadillo.\r\n\r\nORDER II. _Rodentia._ Incisor teeth chisel-shaped, usually two above and\r\ntwo below. Examples: beaver, rat, porcupine, rabbit, squirrel.\r\n\r\nORDER III. _Cetacea._ Adapted to marine life. Examples: whale, porpoise.\r\n\r\nORDER IV. _Ungulata._ Hoofs, teeth adapted for grinding. Examples: (_a_)\r\nodd-toed, horse, rhinoceros, tapir; (_b_) even-toed, ox, pig, sheep, deer.\r\n\r\nORDER V. _Carnivora._ Long canine teeth, sharp and long claws. Examples:\r\ndog, cat, lion, bear, seal, and sea lion.\r\n\r\nORDER VI. _Insectivora._ Example: mole.\r\n\r\nORDER VII. _Cheiroptera._ Fore limbs adapted to flight, teeth pointed.\r\nExample: bat.\r\n\r\nORDER VIII. _Primates._ Erect or nearly so, fore appendage provided with\r\nhand. Examples: monkey, ape, man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The geological history of the horse. (After Mathews, in the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History.) Ask your teacher to explain this\r\ndiagram.]\r\n\r\nIncreasing Complexity of Structure and of Habits in Plants and Animals.--In\r\nour study of biology so far we have attempted to get some notion of the\r\nvarious factors which act upon living things. We have seen how plants and\r\nanimals interact upon each other. We have learned something about the\r\nvarious physiological processes of plants and animals, and have found them\r\nto be in many respects identical. We have found grades of complexity in\r\nplants from the one-celled plant, bacterium or pleurococcus, to the\r\ncomplicated flowering plants of considerable size and with many organs. So\r\nin animal life, from the Protozoa upward, there is constant change, and the\r\nchange is toward greater complexity of structure and functions. An insect\r\nis a higher type of life than a protozoan, because its structure is more\r\ncomplex and it can perform its work with more ease and accuracy. A fish is\r\na higher type of animal than the insect for these same reasons, and also\r\nfor another. The fish has an internal skeleton which forms a pointed column\r\nof bones on the _dorsal_ side (the back) of the animal. It is a vertebrate\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The evolutionary tree. Modified from Galloway. Copy this\r\ndiagram in your notebook. Explain it as well as you can.]\r\n\r\nThe Doctrine of Evolution.--We have now learned that animal forms may be\r\narranged so as to begin with very simple one-celled forms and culminate\r\nwith a group which contains man himself. This arrangement is called the\r\n_evolutionary series_. Evolution means change, and these groups are\r\nbelieved by scientists to represent stages in complexity of development of\r\nlife on the earth. Geology teaches that millions of years ago, life upon\r\nthe earth was very simple, and that gradually more and more complex forms\r\nof life appeared, as the rocks formed latest in time show the most highly\r\ndeveloped forms of animal life. The great English scientist, Charles\r\nDarwin, from this and other evidence, explained the theory of evolution.\r\nThis is the belief that simple forms of life on the earth slowly and\r\ngradually gave rise to those more complex and that thus ultimately the most\r\ncomplex forms came into existence.\r\n\r\nThe Number of Animal Species.--Over 500,000 species of animals are known to\r\nexist to-day, as the following table shows.\r\n\r\n  Protozoa          8,000     Arachnids     16,000\r\n  Sponges           2,500     Crustaceans   16,000\r\n  Coelenterates     4,500     Mollusks      61,000\r\n  Echinoderms       4,000     Fishes        13,000\r\n  Flat-worms        5,000     Amphibians     1,400\r\n  Roundworms        1,500     Reptiles       3,500\r\n  Annelids          4,000     Birds         13,000\r\n  Insects         360,000     Mammals        3,500\r\n  Myriapods         2,000                  -------\r\n                                Total      518,900\r\n\r\nMan's Place in Nature.--Although we know that man is separated mentally by\r\na wide gap from all other animals, in our study of physiology we must ask\r\nwhere we are to place man. If we attempt to classify man, we see at once he\r\nmust be placed with the vertebrate animals because of his possession of a\r\nvertebral column. Evidently, too, he is a mammal, because the young are\r\nnourished by milk secreted by the mother and because his body has at least\r\na partial covering of hair. Anatomically we find that we must place man\r\nwith the apelike mammals, because of these numerous points of structural\r\nlikeness. The group of mammals which includes the monkeys, apes, and man we\r\ncall the _primates_.\r\n\r\nAlthough anatomically there is a greater difference between the lowest type\r\nof monkey and the highest type of ape than there is between the highest\r\ntype of ape and the lowest savage, yet there is an immense mental gap\r\nbetween monkey and man.\r\n\r\nInstincts.--Mammals are considered the highest of vertebrate animals, not\r\nonly because of their complicated structure, but because their instincts\r\nare so well developed. Monkeys certainly seem to have many of the mental\r\nattributes of man.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thorndike of Columbia University sums up their habits of learning\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"In their method of learning, although monkeys do not reach the human\r\n     stage of a rich life of ideas, yet they carry the animal method of\r\n     learning, by the selection of impulses and association of them with\r\n     different sense-impressions, to a point beyond that reached by any\r\n     other of the lower animals. In this, too, they resemble man; for he\r\n     differs from the lower animals not only in the possession of a new\r\n     sort of intelligence, but also in the tremendous extension of that\r\n     sort which he has in common with them. A fish learns slowly a few\r\n     simple habits. Man learns quickly an infinitude of habits that may be\r\n     highly complex. Dogs and cats learn more than the fish, while monkeys\r\n     learn more than they. In the number of things he learns, the complex\r\n     habits he can form, the variety of lines along which he can learn\r\n     them, and in their permanence when once formed, the monkey justifies\r\n     his inclusion with man in a separate mental genus.\"\r\n\r\nEvolution of Man.--Undoubtedly there once lived upon the earth races of men\r\nwho were much lower in their mental organization than the present\r\ninhabitants. If we follow the early history of man upon the earth, we find\r\nthat at first he must have been little better than one of the lower\r\nanimals. He was a nomad, wandering from place to place, feeding upon\r\nwhatever living things he could kill with his hands. Gradually he must have\r\nlearned to use weapons, and thus kill his prey, first using rough stone\r\nimplements for this purpose. As man became more civilized, implements of\r\nbronze and of iron were used. About this time the subjugation and\r\ndomestication of animals began to take place. Man then began to cultivate\r\nthe fields, and to have a fixed place of abode other than a cave. The\r\nbeginnings of civilization were long ago, but even to-day the earth is not\r\nentirely civilized.\r\n\r\nThe Races of Man.--At the present time there exist upon the earth five\r\nraces or varieties of man, each very different from the other in instincts,\r\nsocial customs, and, to an extent, in structure. These are the Ethiopian or\r\nnegro type, originating in Africa; the Malay or brown race, from the\r\nislands of the Pacific; the American Indian; the Mongolian or yellow race,\r\nincluding the natives of China, Japan, and the Eskimos; and finally, the\r\nhighest type of all, the Caucasians, represented by the civilized white\r\ninhabitants of Europe and America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_, American\r\n       Book Company.\r\n     Bulletin of U.

THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n_Problems.--I. To determine the uses of animals._\r\n          _(a) Indirectly as food._\r\n          _(b) Directly as food._\r\n          _(c) As domesticated animals._\r\n          _(d) For clothing._\r\n          _(e) Other direct economic uses._\r\n          _(f) Destruction of harmful plants and animals._\r\n         _--II. To determine the harm done by animals._\r\n          _(a) Animals destructive to those used for food._\r\n          _(b) Animals harmful to crops and gardens._\r\n          _(c) Animals harmful to fruit and forest trees._\r\n          _(d) Animals destructive to stored food or clothing._\r\n          _(e) Animals indirectly or directly responsible for disease._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     Inasmuch as this work is planned for the winter months the\r\n     laboratory side must be largely museum and reference work.\r\n     It is to be expected that the teacher will wish to refer to\r\n     much of this work at the time work is done on a given group.\r\n     But it is pedagogically desirable that the work as planned\r\n     should be _varied_. Interest is thus held. Outlines prepared\r\n     by the teacher to be filled in by the student are desirable\r\n     because they lead the pupil to individual selection of what\r\n     seems to _him_ as important material. Opportunity should be\r\n     given for laboratory exercises based on original sources.\r\n     The pupils should be made to use reports of the U. S.\r\n     Department of Agriculture, the Biological Survey, various\r\n     States Reports, and others.\r\n\r\n     Special home laboratory reports may be well made at this\r\n     time, for example: determination at a local fish market of\r\n     the fish that are cheap and fresh at a given time. Have the\r\n     students give reasons for this. Study conditions in the meat\r\n     market in a similar manner. Other local food conditions may\r\n     also be studied first hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\nIndirect Use as Food.--Just as plants form the food of animals, so some\r\nanimals are food for others. Man may make use of such food directly or\r\nindirectly. Many mollusks, as the barnacle and mussel, are eaten by fishes.\r\nOther fish live upon tiny organisms, water fleas and other small\r\ncrustaceans. These in turn feed upon still smaller animals, and we may go\r\nback and back until finally we come to the Protozoa and one-celled water\r\nplants as an ultimate source of food.\r\n\r\nDirect Use as Food. Lower Forms.--The forms of life lower than the\r\nCrustacea are of little use directly as food, although the Chinese are very\r\nfond of one of the Echinoderms, a holothurian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North American lobster. This specimen, preserved at the U.\r\nS. Fish Commission at Woods Hole, was of unusual size and weighed over\r\ntwenty pounds.]\r\n\r\nCrustacea as Food.--Crustaceans, however, are of considerable value for\r\nfood, the lobster fisheries in particular being of importance. The lobster\r\nis highly esteemed as food, and is rapidly disappearing from our coasts as\r\nthe result of overfishing. Between twenty and thirty million are yearly\r\ntaken on the North Atlantic coast. This means a value at present prices of\r\nabout $15,000,000. Laws have been enacted in New York and other states\r\nagainst overfishing. Egg-carrying lobsters must be returned to the water;\r\nall smaller than six to nine inches in length (the law varies in different\r\nstates) must be put back; other restrictions are placed upon the taking of\r\nthe animals, in hope of saving the race from extinction. Some states now\r\nhatch and care for the young for a period of time; the United States Bureau\r\nof Fisheries is also doing much good work, in the hope of restocking to\r\nsome extent the now almost depleted waters.\r\n\r\nSeveral other common crustaceans are near relatives of the crayfish. Among\r\nthem are the shrimp and prawn, thin-shelled, active crustaceans common\r\nalong our eastern coast. In spite of the fact that they form a large part\r\nof the food supply of many marine animals, especially fish, they do not\r\nappear to be decreasing in numbers. They are also used as food by man, the\r\nshrimp fisheries in this country aggregating over $1,000,000 yearly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The edible blue crab. (From a photograph loaned by the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History.)]\r\n\r\nAnother edible crustacean of considerable economic importance is the blue\r\ncrab. Crabs are found inhabiting muddy bottoms; in such localities they are\r\ncaught in great numbers in nets or traps baited with decaying meat. They\r\nare, indeed, among our most valuable sea scavengers, although they are\r\ncarnivorous hunters as well. The young crabs differ considerably in form\r\nfrom the adult. They undergo a complete _metamorphosis_ (change of form).\r\nImmediately after molting or shedding of the outer shell in order to grow\r\nlarger, crabs are greatly desired by man as an article of food. They are\r\nthen known as \"shedders,\" or soft-shelled crabs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The oyster.]\r\n\r\nMollusks as Food.--Oysters are never found in muddy localities, for in such\r\nplaces they would be quickly smothered by the sediment in the water. They\r\nare found in nature clinging to stones or on shells or other objects which\r\nproject a little above the bottom. Here food is abundant and oxygen is\r\nobtained from the water surrounding them. Hence oyster raisers throw oyster\r\nshells into the water and the young oysters attach themselves.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Europe and this country where oysters are raised\r\nartificially, stakes or brush are sunk in shallow water so that the young\r\noyster, which is at first free-swimming, may escape the danger of\r\nsmothering on the bottom. After the oysters are a year or two old, they are\r\ntaken up and put down in deeper water as seed oysters. At the age of three\r\nand four years they are ready for the market.\r\n\r\nThe oyster industry is one of the most profitable of our fisheries. Nearly\r\n$15,000,000 a year has been derived during the last decade from such\r\nsources. Hundreds of boats and thousands of men are engaged in dredging for\r\noysters. Three of the most important of our oyster grounds are Long Island\r\nSound, Narragansett Bay, and Chesapeake Bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This diagram shows how cases of intestinal disease (typhoid\r\nand diarrhoea) have been traced to oysters from a locality where they were\r\n\"fattened\" in water contaminated with sewage. (Loaned by American Museum of\r\nNatural History.)]\r\n\r\nSometimes oysters are artificially \"fattened\" by placing them on beds near\r\nthe mouths of fresh-water streams. Too often these streams are the bearers\r\nof much sewage, and the oyster, which lives on microscopic organisms, takes\r\nin a number of bacteria with other food. Thus a person might become\r\ninfected with the typhoid bacillus by eating raw oysters. State and city\r\nsupervision of the oyster industry makes this possibility very much less\r\nthan it was a few years ago, as careful bacteriological analysis of the\r\nsurrounding water is constantly made by competent experts.\r\n\r\nClams.--Other bivalve mollusks used for food are clams and scallops. Two\r\nspecies of the former are known to New Yorkers, one as the \"round,\" another\r\nas the \"long\" or \"soft-shelled\" clams. The former (_Venus mercenaria_) was\r\ncalled by the Indians \"quahog,\" and is still so called in the Eastern\r\nstates. The blue area of its shell was used by the Indians to make wampum,\r\nor money. The quahog is now extensively used as food. The \"long\" clam (_Mya\r\narenaria_) is considered better eating by the inhabitants of Massachusetts\r\nand Rhode Island. This clam was highly prized as food by the Indians. The\r\nclam industries of the eastern coast aggregate nearly $1,000,000 a year.\r\nThe dredging for scallops, another molluscan delicacy, forms an important\r\nindustry along certain parts of the eastern coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Salmon leaping a fall on their way to their spawning beds.\r\n(Photographed by Dr. John A. Sampson.)]\r\n\r\nFish as Food.--Fish are used as food the world over. From very early times\r\nthe herring were pursued by the Norsemen. Fresh-water fish, such as\r\nwhitefish, perch, pickerel, pike, and the various members of the trout\r\nfamily, are esteemed food and, especially in the Great Lake region, form\r\nimportant fisheries. But by far the most important food fishes are those\r\nwhich are taken in salt water. Here we have two types of fisheries, those\r\nwhere the fish comes up a river to spawn, as the salmon, sturgeon, or shad,\r\nand those in which fishes are taken on their feeding grounds in the open\r\nocean. Herring are the world's most important catch, though not in this\r\ncountry. Here the salmon of the western coast is taken to the value of over\r\n$13,000,000 a year. Cod fishing also forms an important industry; over 7000\r\nmen being employed and over $2,000,000 of codfish being taken each year in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Globe Fisheries.]\r\n\r\nHundreds of other species of fish are used as food, the fish that is\r\nnearest at hand being often the cheapest and best. Why, for example, is the\r\nflounder so cheap in the New York markets? In what waters are the cod and\r\nherring fisheries, sardine, oyster, sponge, pearl oyster? (See chart on\r\npage 201.)\r\n\r\nAmphibia and Reptiles as Food.--Frogs' legs are esteemed a delicacy.\r\nCertain reptiles are used as food by people of other nationalities, the\r\nIguana, a Mexican lizard, being an example. Many of the sea-water turtles\r\nare of large size, the leatherback and the green turtle often weighing six\r\nhundred to seven hundred pounds each. The flesh of the green turtle and\r\nespecially of the diamond-back terrapin, an animal found in the salt\r\nmarshes along our southeastern coast, is highly esteemed as food.\r\nUnfortunately for the preservation of the species, these animals are\r\nusually taken during the breeding season when they go to sandy beaches to\r\nlay their eggs.\r\n\r\nBirds as Food.--Birds, both wild and domesticated, form part of our food\r\nsupply. Unfortunately our wild game birds are disappearing so fast that we\r\nshould not consider them as a source of food. Our domestic fowls, turkey,\r\nducks, etc., form an important food supply and poultry farms give lucrative\r\nemployment to many people. Eggs of domesticated birds are of great\r\nimportance as food, and egg albumin is used for other purposes,--clarifying\r\nsugars, coating photographic papers, etc.\r\n\r\nMammals as Food.--When we consider the amount of wealth invested in cattle\r\nand other domesticated animals bred and used for food in the United States,\r\nwe see the great economic importance of mammals. The United States,\r\nArgentina, and Australia are the greatest producers of cattle. In this\r\ncountry hogs are largely raised for food. They are used fresh, salted,\r\nsmoked as ham and bacon, and pickled. Sheep, which are raised in great\r\nquantities in Australia, Argentina, Russia, Uruguay, and this country, are\r\none of the world's greatest meat supplies.\r\n\r\nGoats, deer, many larger game animals, seals, walruses, etc., give food to\r\npeople who live in parts of the earth that are less densely populated.\r\n\r\nDomesticated Animals.-- When man emerged from his savage state on the\r\nearth, one of the first signs of the beginning of civilization was the\r\ndomestication of animals. The dog, the cow, sheep, and especially the\r\nhorse, mark epochs in the advance of civilization. Beasts of burden are\r\nused the world over, horses almost all over the world, certain cattle, as\r\nthe water buffalo, in tropical Malaysia; camels, goats, and the llama are\r\nalso used as draft animals in some other countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Feeding silkworms. The caterpillars are the white objects in\r\nthe trays.]\r\n\r\nMan's wealth in many parts of the world is estimated in terms of his cattle\r\nor herds of sheep. So many products come from these sources that a long\r\nlist might be given, such as meats, milk, butter, cheese, wool, or other\r\nbody coverings, leather, skins, and hides used for other purposes. Great\r\nindustries are directly dependent upon our domesticated animals, as the\r\nmaking of shoes, the manufacture of woolen cloth, the tanning industry, and\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\nUses for Clothing.--The manufacture of silk is due to the production of raw\r\nsilk by the silkworm, the caterpillar of a moth. It lives upon the mulberry\r\nand makes a cocoon from which the silk is wound. The Chinese silkworm is\r\nnow raised to a slight extent in southern California. China, Japan, Italy,\r\nand France, because of cheaper labor, are the most successful silk-raising\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe use of wool gives rise to many great industries. After the wool is cut\r\nfrom the sheep, it has to be washed and scoured to get out the dirt and\r\ngrease. This wool fat or lanoline is used in making soap and ointments. The\r\nwool is next \"carded,\" the fibers being interwoven by the fine teeth of the\r\ncarding machine or \"combed,\" the fibers here being pulled out parallel to\r\neach other. Carded wool becomes woolen goods; combed wool, worsted goods.\r\nThe wastes are also utilized, being mixed with \"shoddy\" (wool from cloth\r\ncuttings or rags) to make woolen goods of a cheap grade.\r\n\r\nGoat hair, especially that of the Angora and the Cashmere goat, has much\r\nuse in the clothing industries. Camel's hair and alpaca are also used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Polar bear, a fur-bearing mammal which is rapidly being\r\nexterminated. Why?]\r\n\r\nFur.--The furs of many domesticated and wild animals are of importance. The\r\nCarnivora as a group are of much economic importance as the source of most\r\nof our fur. The fur seal fisheries alone amount to many millions of dollars\r\nannually. Otters, skunks, sables, weasels, foxes, and minks are of\r\nconsiderable importance as fur producers. Even cats are now used for fur,\r\nusually masquerading under some other name. The fur of the beaver, one of\r\nthe largest of the rodents or gnawing mammals, is of considerable value, as\r\nare the coats of the chinchilla, muskrats, squirrels, and other rodents.\r\nThe fur of the rabbit and nutria are used in the manufacture of felt hats.\r\nThe quills of the porcupines (greatly developed and stiffened hairs) have a\r\nslight commercial value.\r\n\r\nConservation of Fur-bearing Animals Needed.--As time goes on and the furs\r\nof wild animals become scarcer and scarcer through overkilling, we find the\r\nneed for protection and conservation of many of these fast-vanishing wild\r\nforms more and more imperative. Already breeding of some fur-bearing\r\nanimals has been tried with success, and cheap substitutes for wild animal\r\nskins are coming more and more into the markets. Black-fox breeding has\r\nbeen tried successfully in Prince Edward Island, Canada, $2500 to $3000\r\nbeing given for a single skin. Skunk, marten, and mink are also being bred\r\nfor the market. Game preserves in this country and Canada are also helping\r\nto preserve our wild fur-bearing animals.\r\n\r\nAnimal Oils.--Whale oil, obtained from the fat or \"blubber\" of whales, is\r\nused extensively for lubricating. Neat's-foot oil comes from the feet of\r\ncattle and is also used in lubrication. Tallow and lard, two fats from\r\ncattle, sheep, and pigs, have so many well-known uses that comment is\r\nunnecessary. Cod-liver oil is used medically and is well known. But it is\r\nnot so widely known that a fish called the menhaden or \"moss bunkers\" of\r\nthe Atlantic coast produces over 3,000,000 gallons of oil every year and is\r\nbeing rapidly exterminated in consequence.\r\n\r\nHides, Horns, Hoofs, etc.--Leathers, from cattle, horses, sheep, and goats,\r\nare used everywhere. Leather manufacture is one of the great industries of\r\nthe Eastern states, hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in its\r\nmanufacturing plants. Horns and bones are utilized for making combs,\r\nbuttons, handles for brushes, etc. Glue is made from the animal matter in\r\nbones. Ivory, obtained from elephant, walrus, and other tusks, forms a\r\nvaluable commercial product. It is largely used for knife handles, piano\r\nkeys, combs, etc.\r\n\r\nPerfumes.--The musk deer, musk ox, and muskrat furnish a valuable perfume\r\ncalled musk. Civet cats also give us a somewhat similar perfume. Ambergris,\r\na basis for delicate perfumes, comes from the intestines of the sperm\r\nwhale.\r\n\r\nProtozoa.--The Protozoa have played an important part in rock building. The\r\nchalk beds of Kansas and other chalk formations are made up to a large\r\nextent of the tiny skeletons of _Protozoa_, called _Foraminifera_. Some\r\nlimestone rocks are also composed in large part of such skeletons. The\r\nskeletons of some species are used to make a polishing powder.\r\n\r\nSponges.--The sponges of commerce have the skeleton composed of tough\r\nfibers of material somewhat like that of cow's horn. This fiber is elastic\r\nand has the power of absorbing water. In a living state, the horny fiber\r\nsponge is a dark-colored fleshy mass, usually found attached to rocks. The\r\nwarm waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the West Indies furnish most of\r\nour sponges. The sponges are pulled up from their resting place on the\r\nbottom, by means of long-handled rakes operated by men in boats or are\r\nsecured by divers. They are then spread out on the shore in the sun, and\r\nthe living tissues allowed to decay; then after treatment consisting of\r\nbeating, bleaching, and trimming, the bath sponge is ready for the market.\r\nSome forms of coral are of commercial value. The red coral of the\r\nMediterranean Sea is the best example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In some countries little metal images of Buddha are placed\r\nwithin the shells of living pearl oysters or clams. Over these the mantle\r\nof the animal secretes a layer of mother of pearl as is shown in the\r\npicture.]\r\n\r\nPearls and Mother of Pearl.--Pearls are prized the world over. It is a\r\nwell-known fact that even in this country pearls of some value are\r\nsometimes found within the shells of the fresh-water mussel and the oyster.\r\nMost of the finest, however, come from the waters around Ceylon. If a pearl\r\nis cut open and examined carefully, it is found to be a deposit of the\r\nmother-of-pearl layer of the shell around some central structure. It has\r\nbeen believed that any foreign substance, as a grain of sand, might\r\nirritate the mantle at a given point, thus stimulating it to secrete around\r\nthe substance. It now seems likely that most perfect pearls are due to the\r\ngrowth within the mantle of the clam or oyster of certain parasites, stages\r\nin the development of a flukeworm. The irritation thus set up in the tissue\r\ncauses mother of pearl to be deposited around the source of irritation,\r\nwith the subsequent formation of a pearl.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-button industry in this country is largely dependent upon the\r\nfresh-water mussel, the shells of which are used. This mussel is being so\r\nrapidly depleted that the national government is working out a means of\r\nartificial propagation of these animals.\r\n\r\nHoney and Wax.--Honeybees[29] are kept in hives. A colony consists of a\r\nqueen, a female who lays the eggs for the colony, the drones, whose duty it\r\nis to fertilize the eggs, and the workers.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 29: Their daily life may be easily watched in the\r\n     schoolroom, by means of one of the many good and cheap\r\n     observation hives now made to be placed in a window frame.\r\n     Directions for making a small observation hive for school\r\n     work can be found in Hodge, _Nature Study and Life_, Chap.\r\n     XIV. Bulletin No. 1, U. S. Department of Agriculture,\r\n     entitled _The Honey Bee_, by Frank Benton, is valuable for\r\n     the amateur beekeeper. It may be obtained for twenty-five\r\n     cents from the Superintendent of Documents, Union Building,\r\n     Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cells of honeycomb, queen cell on right at bottom.]\r\n\r\nThe cells of the comb are built by the workers out of wax secreted from the\r\nunder surface of their bodies. The wax is cut off in thin plates by means\r\nof the wax shears between the two last joints of the hind legs. These cells\r\nare used to place the eggs of the queen in, one egg to each cell, and the\r\nyoung are hatched after three days, to begin life as footless white grubs.\r\n\r\nThe young are fed for several days, then shut up in the cells and allowed\r\nto form pupae. Eventually they break their cells and take their place as\r\nworkers in the hive, first as nurses for the young and later as pollen\r\ngatherers and honey makers.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (pages 37 to 39) that the honeybee gathers nectar,\r\nwhich she swallows, keeping the fluid in her crop until her return to the\r\nhive. Here it is forced out into cells of the comb. It is now thinner than\r\nwhat we call honey. To thicken it, the bees swarm over the open cells,\r\nmoving their wings very rapidly, thus evaporating some of the water. A hive\r\nof bees have been known to make over thirty-one pounds of honey in a single\r\nday, although the average is very much less than this. It is estimated from\r\ntwenty to thirty millions of dollars' worth of honey and wax are produced\r\neach year in this country.\r\n\r\nCochineal and Lac.--Among other products of insect origin is cochineal, a\r\nred coloring matter, which consists of the dried bodies of a tiny insect,\r\none of the plant lice which lives on the cactus plants in Mexico and\r\nCentral America. The lac insect, another one of the plant lice, feeds on\r\nthe juices of certain trees in India and pours out a substance from its\r\nbody which after treatment forms shellac. Shellac is of much use as a basis\r\nfor varnish.\r\n\r\nGall Insects.--Oak galls, growths caused by the sting of wasp-like insects,\r\ngive us products used in ink making, in tanning, and in making pyrogallic\r\nacid which is much used in developing photographs.\r\n\r\nInsects destroy Harmful Plants or Animals.--Some forms of animal life are\r\nof great importance because of their destruction of harmful plants or\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An insect friend of man. An ichneumon fly boring in a tree\r\nto lay its eggs in the burrow of a boring insect harmful to that tree.]\r\n\r\nA near relative of the bee, called the ichneumon fly, does man indirectly\r\nconsiderable good because of its habit of laying its eggs and rearing the\r\nyoung in the bodies of caterpillars which are harmful to vegetation. Some\r\nof the ichneumons even bore into trees in order to deposit their eggs in\r\nthe larvae of wood-boring insects. It is safe to say that the ichneumons\r\nsave millions of dollars yearly to this country.\r\n\r\nSeveral beetles are of value to man. Most important of these is the natural\r\nenemy of the orange-tree scale, the ladybug, or ladybird beetle. In New\r\nYork state it may often be found feeding upon the plant lice, or aphids,\r\nwhich live on rosebushes. The carrion beetles and many water beetles act as\r\nscavengers. The sexton beetles bury dead carcasses of animals. Ants in\r\ntropical countries are particularly useful as scavengers.\r\n\r\nInsects, besides pollinating flowers, often do a service by eating harmful\r\nweeds. Thus many harmful plants are kept in check. We have noted that they\r\nspin silk, thus forming clothing; that in many cases they are preyed upon,\r\nand that they supply an enormous multitude of birds, fishes, and other\r\nanimals with food.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The common toad, an insect eater.]\r\n\r\nUse of the Toad.--The toad is of great economic importance to man because\r\nof its diet. No less than eighty-three species of insects, mostly\r\ninjurious, have been proved to enter into the dietary. A toad has been\r\nobserved to snap up one hundred and twenty-eight flies in half an hour.\r\nThus at a low estimate it could easily destroy one hundred insects during a\r\nday and do an immense service to the garden during the summer. It has been\r\nestimated by Kirkland that a single toad may, on account of the cutworms\r\nwhich it kills, be worth $19.88 each season it lives, if the damage done by\r\neach cutworm be estimated at only one cent. Toads also feed upon slugs and\r\nother garden pests.\r\n\r\nBirds eat Insects.--The food of birds makes them of the greatest economic\r\nimportance to our country. This is because of the relation of insects to\r\nagriculture. A large part of the diet of most of our native birds includes\r\ninsects harmful to vegetation. Investigations undertaken by the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture (Division of Biological Survey) show that\r\na surprisingly large number of birds once believed to harm crops really\r\nperform a service by killing injurious insects. Even the much maligned crow\r\nlives to some extent upon insects. Swallows in the Southern states kill the\r\ncotton-boll weevil, one of our worst insect pests. Our earliest visitor,\r\nthe bluebird, subsists largely on injurious insects, as do woodpeckers,\r\ncuckoos, kingbirds, and many others. The robin, whose presence in the\r\ncherry tree we resent, during the rest of the summer does much good by\r\nfeeding upon noxious insects. Birds use the food substances which are most\r\nabundant around them at the time.[30]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 30: The following quotation from I. P. Trimble, _A\r\n     Treatise on the Insect Enemies of Fruit and Shade Trees_,\r\n     bears out this statement: \"On the fifth of May, 1864, ...\r\n     seven different birds ... had been feeding freely upon small\r\n     beetles.... There was a great flight of beetles that day;\r\n     the atmosphere was teeming with them. A few days after, the\r\n     air was filled with Ephemera flies, and the same species of\r\n     birds were then feeding upon them.\"\r\n\r\n     During the outbreak of Rocky Mountain locusts in Nebraska in\r\n     1874-1877, Professor Samuel Aughey saw a long-billed marsh\r\n     wren carry thirty locusts to her young in an hour. At this\r\n     rate, for seven hours a day, a brood would consume 210\r\n     locusts per day, and the passerine birds of the eastern half\r\n     of Nebraska, allowing only twenty broods to the square mile,\r\n     would destroy daily 162,771,000 of the pests. The average\r\n     locust weighs about fifteen grains, and is capable each day\r\n     of consuming its own weight of standing forage crops, which\r\n     at $10 per ton would be worth $1743.26. This case may serve\r\n     as an illustration of the vast good that is done every year\r\n     by the destruction of insect pests fed to nestling birds.\r\n     And it should be remembered that the nesting season is also\r\n     that when the destruction of injurious insects is most\r\n     needed; that is, at the period of greatest agricultural\r\n     activity and before the parasitic insects can be depended on\r\n     to reduce the pests. The encouragement of birds to nest on\r\n     the farm and the discouragement of nest robbing are\r\n     therefore more than mere matters of sentiment; they return\r\n     an actual cash equivalent, and have a definite bearing on\r\n     the success or failure of the crops.--_Year Book of the\r\n     Department of Agriculture._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Food of some common birds. Which of the above birds should\r\nbe protected by man and why?]\r\n\r\nBirds eat Weed Seeds.--Not only do birds aid man in his battles with\r\ndestructive insects, but seed-eating birds eat the seeds of weeds. Our\r\nnative sparrows (not the English sparrow), the mourning dove, bobwhite, and\r\nother birds feed largely upon the seeds of many of our common weeds. This\r\nfact alone is sufficient to make birds of vast economic importance.\r\n\r\nNot all birds are seed or insect feeders. Some, as the cormorants, ospreys,\r\ngulls, and terns, are active fishers. Near large cities gulls especially\r\nact as scavengers, destroying much floating garbage that otherwise might be\r\nwashed ashore to become a menace to health. The vultures of India and\r\nsemitropical countries are of immense value as scavengers. Birds of prey\r\n(owls) eat living mammals, including many rodents; for example, field mice,\r\nrats, and other pests.\r\n\r\nExtermination of our Native Birds.--Within our own times we have witnessed\r\nthe almost total extermination of some species of our native birds. The\r\nAmerican passenger pigeon, once very abundant in the Middle West, is now\r\nextinct. Audubon, the greatest of all American bird lovers, gives a graphic\r\naccount of the migration of a flock of these birds. So numerous were they\r\nthat when the flock rose in the air the sun was darkened, and at night the\r\nweight of the roosting birds broke down large branches of the trees in\r\nwhich they rested. To-day not a single wild specimen of this pigeon can be\r\nfound, because they were slaughtered by the hundreds of thousands during\r\nthe breeding season. The wholesale killing of the snowy egret to furnish\r\nornaments for ladies' headwear is another example of the improvidence of\r\nour fellow-countrymen. Charles Dudley Warner said, \"Feathers do not improve\r\nthe appearance of an ugly woman, and a pretty woman needs no such aid.\"\r\nWholesale killing for plumage, eggs, and food, and, alas, often for mere\r\nsport, has reduced the number of our birds more than one half in thirty\r\nstates and territories within the past fifteen years. Every crusade against\r\nindiscriminate killing of our native birds should be welcomed by all\r\nthinking Americans. The recent McLane bill which aims at the protection of\r\nmigrating birds and the bird-protecting clause of the recently passed\r\ntariff bill shows that this country is awaking to the value of her bird\r\nlife. Without the birds the farmer would have a hopeless fight against\r\ninsect pests. The effect of killing native birds is now well seen in Italy\r\nand Japan, where insects are increasing and do greater damage each year to\r\ncrops and trees.\r\n\r\nOf the eight hundred or more species of birds in the United States, only\r\nsix species of hawks (Cooper's and the sharp-shinned hawk in particular),\r\nand the great horned owl, which prey upon useful birds; the sapsucker,\r\nwhich kills or injures many trees because of its fondness for the growing\r\nlayer of the tree; the bobolink, which destroys yearly $2,000,000 worth of\r\nrice in the South; the crow, which feeds on crops as well as insects; and\r\nthe English sparrow, may be considered as enemies of man.\r\n\r\nThe English Sparrow.--The English sparrow is an example of a bird\r\nintroduced for the purpose of insect destruction, that has done great harm\r\nbecause of its relation to our native birds. Introduced at Brooklyn in 1850\r\nfor the purpose of exterminating the cankerworm, it soon abandoned an\r\ninsect diet and has driven out most of our native insect feeders.\r\nInvestigations by the United States Department of Agriculture have shown\r\nthat in the country these birds and their young feed to a large extent upon\r\ngrain, thus showing them to be injurious to agriculture. Dirty and very\r\nprolific, it already has worked its way from the East as far as the Pacific\r\ncoast. In this area the bluebird, song sparrow, and yellowbird have all\r\nbeen forced to give way, as well as many larger birds of great economic\r\nvalue and beauty. The English sparrow has become a pest especially in our\r\ncities, and should be exterminated in order to save our native birds. It is\r\nfeared in some quarters that the English starling which has recently been\r\nintroduced into this country may in time prove a pest as formidable as the\r\nEnglish sparrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This shows how some snakes (constrictors) kill and eat their\r\nprey. (Series photographed by C. W. Beebe and Clarence Halter.)]\r\n\r\nFood of Snakes.--Probably the most disliked and feared of all animals are\r\nthe snakes. This feeling, however, is rarely deserved, for, on the whole,\r\nour common snakes are beneficial to man. The black snake and the milk snake\r\nfeed largely on injurious rodents (rats, mice, etc.), the pretty green\r\nsnake eats injurious insects, and the little DeKay snake feeds partially on\r\nslugs. If it were not that the rattlesnake and the copperhead are venomous,\r\nthey also could be said to be useful, for they live on English sparrows,\r\nrats, mice, moles, and rabbits.\r\n\r\nFood of Herbivorous Animals.--We must not forget that other animals besides\r\ninsects and birds help to keep down the rapidly growing weeds. Herbivorous\r\nanimals the world over destroy, besides the grass which they eat, untold\r\nmultitudes of weeds, which, if unchecked, would drive out the useful\r\noccupants of the pasture, the grasses and grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARM DONE BY ANIMALS\r\n\r\nEconomic Loss from Insects.--The money value of crops, forest trees, stored\r\nfoods, and other material destroyed annually by insects is beyond belief.\r\nIt is estimated that they get one tenth of the country's crops, at the\r\nlowest estimate a matter of some $300,000,000 yearly. \"The common schools\r\nof the country cost in 1902 the sum of $235,000,000, and all higher\r\ninstitutions of learning cost less than $50,000,000, making the total cost\r\nof education in the United States considerably less than the farmers lost\r\nfrom insect ravages.\r\n\r\n     \"Furthermore, the yearly losses from insect ravages\r\n     aggregate nearly twice as much as it costs to maintain our\r\n     army and navy; more than twice the loss by fire; twice the\r\n     capital invested in manufacturing agricultural implements;\r\n     and nearly three times the estimated value of the products\r\n     of all the fruit orchards, vineyards, and small fruit farms\r\n     in the country.\"--SLINGERLAND.\r\n\r\nThe total yearly value of all farm and forest products in New York is\r\nperhaps $150,000,000, and the one tenth that the insects get is worth\r\n$15,000,000.\r\n\r\nInsects which damage Garden and Other Crops.--The grasshoppers and the\r\nlarvae of various moths do considerable harm here, especially the \"cabbage\r\nworm,\" the cutworm, a feeder on all kinds of garden truck, and the corn\r\nworm, a pest on corn, cotton, tomatoes, peas, and beans.\r\n\r\nAmong the beetles which are found in gardens is the potato beetle, which\r\ndestroys the potato plant. This beetle formerly lived in Mexico upon a wild\r\nplant of the same family as the potato, and came north upon the\r\nintroduction of the potato into Colorado, evidently preferring cultivated\r\nforms to wild forms of this family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cotton-boll weevil. _a_, larva; _b_, pupa; _c_, adult.\r\nEnlarged about four times. (Photographed by Davison.)]\r\n\r\nThe one beetle doing by far the greatest harm in this country is the\r\ncotton-boll weevil. Imported from Mexico, since 1892 it has spread over\r\neastern Texas and into Louisiana. The beetle lays its eggs in the young\r\ncotton fruit or boll, and the larvae feed upon the substance within the\r\nboll. It is estimated that if unchecked this pest would destroy yearly one\r\nhalf of the cotton crop, causing a loss of $250,000,000. Fortunately, the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture is at work on the problem, and,\r\nwhile it has not found any way of exterminating the beetle as yet, it has\r\nbeen found that, by planting more hardy varieties of cotton, the crop\r\nmatures earlier and ripens before the weevils have increased in sufficient\r\nnumbers to destroy the crop (see page 126).\r\n\r\nThe bugs are among our most destructive insects. The most familiar examples\r\nof our garden pests are the squash bug; the chinch bug, which yearly does\r\ndamage estimated at $20,000,000, by sucking the juice from the leaves of\r\ngrain; and the plant lice, or aphids. One, living on the grape, yearly\r\ndestroys immense numbers of vines in the vineyards of France, Germany, and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Female tussock moth which has just emerged from the cocoon\r\nat the left, upon which it has deposited over two hundred eggs. (Photograph\r\nby Davison.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Caterpillar of tussock moth. (Photograph by Davison.)]\r\n\r\nInsects which harm Fruit and Forest Trees.--Great damage is annually done\r\ntrees by the larvae of moths. Massachusetts has already spent over\r\n$3,000,000 in trying to exterminate the imported gypsy moth. The codling\r\nmoth, which bores into apples and pears, is estimated to ruin yearly\r\n$3,000,000 worth of fruit in New York alone, which is by no means the most\r\nimportant apple region of the United States. Among these pests, the most\r\nimportant to the dweller in a large city is the tussock moth, which\r\ndestroys our shade trees. The caterpillar may easily be recognized by its\r\nhairy, tufted red head. The eggs are laid on the bark of shade trees in\r\nwhat look like masses of foam. (See figure on page 215.) By collecting and\r\nburning the egg masses in the fall, we may save many shade trees the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of some moths damage the trees by boring into the wood of the\r\ntree on which they live. Such are the peach, apple, and other fruit-tree\r\nborers common in our orchards. Many beetle larvae also live in trees and\r\nkill annually thousands of forest and shade trees. The hickory borer\r\nthreatens to kill all the hickory trees in the Eastern states.\r\n\r\nAmong the bugs most destructive to trees are the scale insect and the plant\r\nlice. The San Jose scale, a native of China, was introduced into the fruit\r\ngroves of California about 1870 and has spread all over the country. A\r\nladybird beetle, which has also been imported, is the most effective agent\r\nin keeping this pest in check.\r\n\r\nInsects of the House or Storehouse.--Weevils are the greatest pests,\r\nfrequently ruining tons of stored corn, wheat, and other cereals. Roaches\r\nwill eat almost anything, even clothing; they are especially fond of all\r\nkinds of breadstuffs. The carpet beetle is a recognized foe of the\r\nhousekeeper, the larvae feeding upon all sorts of woolen material. The larvae\r\nof the clothes moth do an immense amount of damage, especially to stored\r\nclothing. Fleas, lice, and particularly bedbugs are among man's personal\r\nfoes. Besides being unpleasant they are believed to be disease carriers and\r\nas such should be exterminated.[31]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 31: Directions for the treatment of these pests may\r\n     be found in pamphlets issued by the U. S. Department of\r\n     Agriculture.\r\n\r\nFood of Starfish.--Starfish are enormously destructive to young clams and\r\noysters, as the following evidence, collected by Professor A. D. Mead, of\r\nBrown University, shows. A single starfish was confined in an aquarium with\r\nfifty-six young clams. The largest clam was about the length of one arm of\r\nthe starfish, the smallest about ten millimeters in length. In six days\r\nevery clam in the aquarium was devoured. Hundreds of thousands of dollars'\r\ndamage is done annually to the oysters in Connecticut alone by the ravages\r\nof starfish. During the breeding season of the clam and oyster the boats\r\ndredge up tons of starfish which are thrown on shore to die or to be used\r\nas fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIONS OF ANIMALS TO DISEASE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The life history of the malarial parasite. This cut of the\r\nmalarial parasite shows parts of the body of the mosquito and of man. To\r\nunderstand the life history begin at the point where the mosquito injects\r\nthe crescent-shaped bodies into the blood of man. Notice that after the\r\nspores are released from the corpuscles of man two kinds of cells _may be\r\nformed_. These are probably a sexual stage. Development within the body of\r\nthe mosquito will only take place when the parasite is taken into its body\r\nat this sexual stage.]\r\n\r\nThe Cause of Malaria.--The study of the life history and habits of the\r\nProtozoa has resulted in the finding of many parasitic forms, and the\r\nconsequent explanation of some kinds of disease. One parasitic protozoan\r\nlike an amoeba is called _Plasmodium malariae_. It causes the disease known\r\nas malaria. When a mosquito (the _anopheles_) sucks the blood from a person\r\nhaving malaria this parasite passes into the stomach of the mosquito. After\r\ncompleting a part of its life history within the mosquito's body the\r\nparasite establishes itself within the glands which secrete the saliva of\r\nthe mosquito. After about eight days, if the infected mosquito bites a\r\nperson, some of the parasites are introduced into the blood along with the\r\nsaliva. These parasites enter the corpuscles of the blood, increase in\r\nsize, and then form spores. The rapid process of spore formation results in\r\nthe breaking down of the blood corpuscles and the release of the spores,\r\nand the poisons they manufacture, into the blood. This causes the chill\r\nfollowed by the fever so characteristic of malaria. The spores may again\r\nenter the blood corpuscles and in forty-eight or seventy-two hours repeat\r\nthe process thus described, depending on the kind of malaria they cause.\r\nThe only cure for the disease is _quinine_ in rather large doses. This\r\nkills the parasites in the blood. But quinine should not be taken except\r\nunder a physician's directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How to distinguish the harmless mosquito (_culex_), _a_,\r\nfrom the malarial mosquito (_anopheles_), _b_, when at rest. Notice the\r\nposition of legs and body.]\r\n\r\nThe Malarial Mosquito.--Fortunately for mankind, not all mosquitoes harbor\r\nthe parasite which causes malaria. The harmless mosquito (_culex_) may be\r\nusually distinguished from the mosquito which carries malaria (_anopheles_)\r\nby the position taken when at rest. Culex lays eggs in tiny rafts of one\r\nhundred or more eggs in any standing water; thus the eggs are distinguished\r\nfrom those of anopheles, which are not in rafts. Rain barrels, gutters, or\r\nold cans may breed in a short time enough mosquitoes to stock a\r\nneighborhood. The larvae are known as wigglers. They breathe through a tube\r\nin the posterior end of the body, and may be recognized by their peculiar\r\nmovement when on their way to the surface to breathe. The pupa,\r\ndistinguished by a large thoracic region, breathes through a pair of tubes\r\non the thorax. The fact that both larvae and pupae take air from the surface\r\nof the water makes it possible to kill the mosquito during these stages by\r\npouring oil on the surface of the water where they breed. The introduction\r\nof minnows, gold fish, or other small fish which feed upon the larvae in the\r\nwater where the mosquitoes breed will do much to free a neighborhood from\r\nthis pest. Draining swamps or low land which holds water after a rain is\r\nanother method of extermination. Some of the mosquito-infested districts\r\naround New York City have been almost freed from mosquitoes by draining the\r\nsalt marshes where they breed. Long shallow trenches are so built as to tap\r\nand drain off any standing water in which the eggs might be laid. In this\r\nway the mosquito has been almost exterminated along some parts of our New\r\nEngland coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swamps are drained and all standing water covered with a\r\nfilm of oil in order to exterminate mosquitoes. Why is the oil placed on\r\nthe surface of the water?]\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of historical times, malaria has been prevalent in\r\nregions infested by mosquitoes. The ancient city of Rome was so greatly\r\ntroubled by periodic outbreaks of malarial fever that a goddess of fever\r\ncame to be worshiped in order to lessen the severity of what the\r\ninhabitants believed to be a divine visitation. At the present time the\r\nmalaria of Italy is being successfully fought and conquered by the draining\r\nof the mosquito-breeding marshes. By a little carefully directed oiling of\r\nwater a few boys may make an almost uninhabitable region absolutely safe to\r\nlive in. Why not try it if there are mosquitoes in your neighborhood?\r\n\r\nYellow Fever and Mosquitoes.--Another disease carried by mosquitoes is\r\nyellow fever. In the year 1878 there were 125,000 cases and 12,000 deaths\r\nin the United States, mostly in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. During\r\nthe French occupation of the Panama Canal zone the work was at a standstill\r\npart of the time because of the ravages of yellow fever. Before the war\r\nwith Spain thousands of people were ill in Cuba. But to-day this is\r\nchanged, and yellow fever is under almost complete control, both here and\r\nin the Canal zone, where the mosquito (_stegomyia_) which carries yellow\r\nfever exists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Notice the difference in the number of yearly deaths from\r\nyellow fever before and _after_ the American occupation of Havana.]\r\n\r\nThis is due to the experiments during the summer of 1900 of a Commission of\r\nUnited States army officers, headed by Dr. Walter Reed. Of these men one,\r\nDr. Jesse Lazear, gave up his life to prove experimentally that yellow\r\nfever was caused by mosquitoes. He allowed himself to be bitten by a\r\nmosquito that was known to have bitten a yellow fever patient, contracted\r\nthe disease, and died a martyr to science. Others, soldiers, volunteered to\r\nfurther test by experiment how the disease was spread, so that in the end\r\nDr. Reed was able to prove to the world that if mosquitoes could be\r\nprevented from biting people who had yellow fever the disease could not be\r\nspread. The accompanying illustration shows the result of this knowledge\r\nfor the city of Havana. For years Havana was considered one of the pest\r\nspots of the West Indies. Visitors shunned this port and commerce was much\r\naffected by the constant menace of yellow fever. At the time of the\r\nAmerican occupation after the war with Spain, the experiments referred to\r\nabove were undertaken. The city was cleaned up, proper sanitation\r\nintroduced, screens placed in most buildings, and the breeding places of\r\nthe mosquitoes were so nearly destroyed that the city was practically free\r\nfrom mosquitoes. The result, so far as yellow fever was concerned, was\r\nstartling, as you can see by reference to the chart. Notice also the rise\r\nin the death rate when the young Cuban Republic took control. How do you\r\naccount for that? We all know what American scientific medicine and\r\nsanitation is doing in Panama and in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stegomyia, the carrier of yellow fever. (After Howard.)]\r\n\r\nOther Protozoan Diseases.--Many other diseases of man are probably caused\r\nby parasitic protozoans. Dysentery of one kind appears to be caused by the\r\npresence of an amoeba-like animal in the digestive tract which comes\r\nusually through an impure water supply. Smallpox, rabies, and possibly\r\nother diseases are caused by protozoans. Smallpox, which was once the most\r\ndreaded disease known to man, because of its spread in epidemics, has been\r\nconquered by _vaccination_, of which we shall learn more later. The death\r\nrate from rabies or hydrophobia has in a like manner been greatly reduced\r\nby a treatment founded on the same principles as vaccination and invented\r\nby Louis Pasteur.\r\n\r\nAnother group of protozoan parasites are called _trypanosomes_. These are\r\nparasitic in insects, fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in various parts\r\nof the world. They cause various diseases of cattle and other domestic\r\nanimals, being carried to the animal in most cases by flies. One of this\r\nfamily is believed to live in the blood of native African zebras and\r\nantelopes; seemingly it does them no harm. But if one of these parasites is\r\ntransferred by the dreaded tsetse fly to one of the domesticated horses or\r\ncattle of the colonist of that region, death of the animal results.\r\n\r\nAnother fly carries a species of trypanosome to the natives of Central\r\nAfrica, which causes \"the dreaded and incurable sleeping sickness.\" This\r\ndisease carries off more than fifty thousand natives yearly, and many\r\nEuropeans have succumbed to it. Its ravages are now largely confined to an\r\narea near the large Central African lakes and the Upper Nile, for the fly\r\nwhich carries the disease lives near water, seldom going more than 150 feet\r\nfrom the banks of streams or lakes. The British government is now trying to\r\ncontrol the disease in Uganda by moving all the villages at least two miles\r\nfrom the lakes and rivers. Among other diseases that may be due to\r\nprotozoans is kala-agar, a fever in hot Asiatic countries which is probably\r\ncarried by the bedbug, and African tick fever, probably carried by a small\r\ninsect called the tick. Bubonic plague, one of the most dreaded of all\r\ninfectious diseases, is carried to man by fleas from rats. In this country\r\nmany fatal diseases of cattle, as \"tick,\" or Texas cattle fever, are\r\nprobably caused by protozoans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Life history of house flies, showing from left to right the\r\neggs, larvae, pupae, and adult flies. (Photograph, about natural size, by\r\nOverton.)]\r\n\r\nThe Fly a Disease Carrier.--We have already seen that mosquitoes of\r\ndifferent species carry malaria and yellow fever. Another rather recent\r\naddition to the black list is the house fly or typhoid fly. We shall see\r\nlater with what reason this name is given. The development of the typhoid\r\nfly is extremely rapid. A female may lay from one hundred to two hundred\r\neggs. These are usually deposited in filth or manure. Dung heaps about\r\nstables, privy vaults, ash heaps, uncared-for garbage cans, and fermenting\r\nvegetable refuse form the best breeding places for flies. In warm weather,\r\nthe eggs hatch a day or so after they are laid and become larvae, called\r\nmaggots. After about one week of active feeding, these wormlike maggots\r\nbecome quiet and go into the pupal stage, whence under favorable conditions\r\nthey emerge within less than another week as adult flies. The adults breed\r\nat once, and in a short summer there may be over ten generations of flies.\r\nThis accounts for the great number. Fortunately relatively few flies\r\nsurvive the winter. The membranous wings of the adult fly appear to be two\r\nin number, a second pair being reduced to tiny knobbed hairs called\r\nbalancers. The head is freely movable, with large compound eyes. The mouth\r\nparts form a proboscis, which is tonguelike, the animal obtaining its food\r\nby lapping and sucking. The foot shows a wonderful adaptation for clinging\r\nto smooth surfaces. Two or three pads, each of which bears tubelike hairs\r\nthat secrete a sticky fluid, are found on its under surface. It is by this\r\nmeans that the fly is able to walk upside down, and carry bacteria on its\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The foot of a fly, showing the hooks, hairs, and pads which\r\ncollect and carry bacteria. The fly doesn't wipe his feet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonies of bacteria which have developed in a culture\r\nmedium upon which a fly was allowed to walk.]\r\n\r\nThe Typhoid Fly a Pest.--The common fly is recognized as a pest the world\r\nover. Flies have long been known to spoil food through their filthy habits,\r\nbut it is more recently that the very serious charge of spread of diseases,\r\ncaused by bacteria, has been laid at their door. In a recent experiment two\r\nyoung men from the Connecticut Agricultural Station found that a single fly\r\nmight carry on its feet anywhere from 500 to 6,600,000 bacteria, the\r\naverage number being over 1,200,000. Not all of these germs are harmful,\r\nbut they might easily include those of typhoid fever, tuberculosis, summer\r\ncomplaint, and possibly other diseases. A recent pamphlet published by the\r\nMerchants' Association in New York City shows that the rapid increase of\r\nflies during the summer months has a definite correlation with the increase\r\nin the number of cases of summer complaint. Observations in other cities\r\nseem to show the increase in number of typhoid cases in the early fall is\r\ndue, in part at least, to the same cause. A terrible toll of disease and\r\ndeath may be laid at the door of the typhoid fly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing how flies may spread disease by means of\r\ncontaminating food.]\r\n\r\nRecently the stable fly has been found to carry the dread disease known as\r\ninfantile paralysis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There were 329 typhoid cases in Jacksonville, Florida, in\r\n1910, 158 in 1911, 87 in first 10 months of 1912. 80 to 85 per cent of\r\noutdoor toilets were made fly proof during winter of 1910. Account for the\r\ndecrease in typhoid after the flies were kept out of the toilets.]\r\n\r\nRemedies.--Cleanliness which destroys the breeding place of flies, the\r\nfrequent removal and destruction of garbage, rubbish, and manure, covering\r\nof all food when not in use and especially the _careful_ screening of\r\nwindows and doors during the breeding season, will all play a part in the\r\nreduction of flies. To the motto \"swat the fly\" should be added, \"remove\r\ntheir breeding places!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flea which transmits Bubonic plague from rat to man.]\r\n\r\nOther Insect Disease Carriers.--Fleas and bedbugs have been recently added\r\nto those insects proven to carry disease to man. Bubonic plague, which is\r\nprimarily a disease of rats, is undoubtedly transmitted from the infected\r\nrats to man by the fleas. Fleas are also believed to transmit leprosy\r\nalthough this is not proven.\r\n\r\nTo rid a house of fleas we must first find their breeding places. Old\r\ncarpets, the sleeping places of cats or dogs or any dirty unswept corner\r\nmay hold the eggs of the flea. The young breed in cracks and crevices,\r\nfeeding upon organic matter there. Eventually they come to live as adults\r\non their warm-blooded hosts, cats, dogs, or man. Evidently destruction of\r\nthe breeding places, careful washing of all infected areas, the use of\r\nbenzine or gasoline in crevices where the larvae may be hid are the most\r\neffective methods of extermination. Pets which might harbor fleas should be\r\nwashed frequently with a weak (two to three per cent) solution of creolin.\r\n\r\nBedbugs are difficult to prove as an agent in the transmission of disease\r\nbut their disgusting habits are sufficient reason for their extermination.\r\nIt has been proven by experiment that they may spread typhoid and relapsing\r\nfevers. They prefer human blood to other food and have come to live in\r\nbedrooms and beds because this food can be obtained there. They are\r\nextremely difficult to exterminate because their flat body allows them to\r\nhide in cracks out of sight. Wooden beds are thus better protection for\r\nthem than iron or brass beds. Boiling water poured over the cracks when\r\nthey breed or a mixture of strong corrosive sublimate four parts, alcohol\r\nfour parts and spirits of turpentine one part, are effective remedies.\r\n\r\nHow the Harm done by Insects is Controlled.--The combating of insects is\r\ndirected by several bodies of men, all of which have the same end in view.\r\nThese are the Bureau of Entomology of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, the various state experiment stations, and medical and civic\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Entomology works in harmony with the other divisions of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, giving the time of its experts to the problems\r\nof controlling insects which, for good or ill, influence man's welfare in\r\nthis country. The destruction of the malarial mosquito and control of the\r\ntyphoid fly; the destruction of harmful insects by the introduction of\r\ntheir natural enemies, plant or animal; the perfecting of the honeybee (see\r\nHodge, _Nature Study and Life_, page 240), and the introduction of new\r\nspecies of insects to pollinate flowers not native to this country (see\r\n_Blastophaga_, page 43), are some of the problems to which these men are\r\nnow devoting their time.\r\n\r\nAll the states and territories have, since 1888, established state\r\nexperiment stations, which work in cooperation with the government in the\r\nwar upon injurious insects. These stations are often connected with\r\ncolleges, so that young men who are interested in this kind of natural\r\nscience may have opportunity to learn and to help.\r\n\r\nThe good done by these means directly and indirectly is very great.\r\nBulletins are published by the various state stations and by the Department\r\nof Agriculture, most of which may be obtained free. The most interesting of\r\nthese from the high school standpoint are the Farmers' Bulletins, issued by\r\nthe Department of Agriculture, and the Nature Study pamphlets issued by the\r\nCornell University in New York state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This diagram shows how bubonic plague is carried to man.\r\nExplain the diagram.]\r\n\r\nAnimals Other than Insects may be Disease Carriers.--The common brown rat\r\nis an example of a mammal, harmful to civilized man, which has followed in\r\nhis footsteps all over the world. Starting from China, it spread to eastern\r\nEurope, thence to western Europe, and in 1775 it had obtained a lodgment in\r\nthis country. In seventy-five years it reached the Pacific coast, and is\r\nnow fairly common all over the United States, being one of the most\r\nprolific of all mammals. Rats are believed to carry bubonic plague, the\r\n\"Black Death\" of the Middle Ages, a disease estimated to have killed\r\n25,000,000 people during the fourteenth century. The rat, like man, is\r\nsusceptible to plague; fleas bite the rat and then biting man transmit the\r\ndisease to him. A determined effort is now being made to exterminate the\r\nrat because of its connection with bubonic plague.\r\n\r\nOther Parasitic Animals cause Disease.--Besides parasitic protozoans other\r\nforms of animals have been found that _cause_ disease. Chief among these\r\nare certain round and flat worms, which have come to live as parasites on\r\nman and other animals. A one-sided relationship has thus come into\r\nexistence where the worm receives its living from the host, as the animal\r\nis called on which the parasite lives. Consequently the parasite frequently\r\nbecomes fastened to its host during adult life and often is reduced to a\r\nmere bag through which the fluid food prepared by its host is absorbed.\r\nSometimes a complicated life history has arisen from their parasitic\r\nhabits. Such is seen in the life history of the liver fluke, a flatworm\r\nwhich kills sheep, and in the tapeworm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The life cycle of a tapeworm. (1) The eggs are taken in with\r\nfilthy food by the pig; (2) man eats undercooked pork by means of which the\r\nbladder worm (3) is transferred to his own intestine (4).]\r\n\r\nCestodes or Tapeworms.--These parasites infest man and many other\r\nvertebrate animals. The tapeworm (_Taenia solium_) passes through two stages\r\nin its life history, the first within a pig, the second within the\r\nintestine of man. The developing eggs are passed off with wastes from the\r\nintestine of man. The pig, an animal with dirty habits, may take in the\r\nworm embryos with its food. The worm develops within the intestine of the\r\npig, but soon makes its way into the muscle or other tissues. It is here\r\nknown as a bladderworm. If man eats raw or undercooked pork containing\r\nthese worms, _he_ may become a host for the tapeworm. Thus during its\r\ncomplete life history it has two hosts. Another common tapeworm parasitic\r\non man lives part of its life as an embryo within the muscles of cattle.\r\nThe adult worm consists of a round headlike part provided with hooks, by\r\nmeans of which it fastens itself to the wall of the intestine. This head\r\nnow buds off a series of segmentlike structures, which are practically bags\r\nfull of sperms and eggs. These structures, called _proglottids_, break off\r\nfrom time to time, thus allowing the developing eggs to escape. The\r\nproglottids have no separate digestive systems, but the whole body surface,\r\nbathed in digested food, absorbs it and is thus enabled to grow rapidly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Trichinella spiralis_ imbedded in human muscle. (After\r\nLeuckart.)]\r\n\r\nRoundworms.--Still other wormlike creatures called roundworms are of\r\nimportance to man. Some, as the vinegar eel found in vinegar, or the\r\npinworms parasitic in the lower intestine, particularly of children, do\r\nlittle or no harm. The pork worm or _trichina_, however, is a parasite\r\nwhich may cause serious injury. It passes through the first part of its\r\nexistence as a parasite in a pig or other vertebrate (cat, rat, or rabbit),\r\nwhere it lies, covered within a tiny sac or _cyst_, in the muscles of its\r\nhosts. If raw pork containing these worms is eaten by man, the cyst is\r\ndissolved off by the action of the digestive fluids, and the living\r\ntrichina becomes free in the intestine of man. Here it reproduces and the\r\nyoung bore their way through the intestine walls and enter the muscles,\r\ncausing inflammation there. This causes a painful and often fatal disease\r\nknown as _trichinosis_.\r\n\r\nThe Hookworm.--The discovery by Dr. C. W. Stiles of the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, that the laziness and shiftlessness of the \"poor whites\" of the\r\nSouth is partly due to a parasite called the _hookworm_, reads like a fairy\r\ntale.\r\n\r\nThe people, largely farmers, become infected with a larval stage of the\r\nhookworm, which develops in moist earth. It enters the body usually through\r\nthe skin of the feet, for children and adults alike, in certain localities\r\nwhere the disease is common, go barefoot to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nA complicated journey from the skin to the intestine now follows, the larvae\r\npassing through the veins to the heart, from there to the lungs; here they\r\nbore into the air passages and eventually work their way by way of the\r\nwindpipe into the intestine. One result of the injury of the lungs is that\r\nmany thus infected are subject to tuberculosis. The adult worms, once in\r\nthe food tube, fasten themselves and feed upon the blood of their host by\r\npuncturing the intestine wall. The loss of blood from this cause is not\r\nsufficient to account for the bloodlessness of the person infected, but it\r\nhas been discovered that the hookworm pours out a poison into the wound\r\nwhich prevents the blood from clotting rapidly (see page 315); hence a\r\nconsiderable loss of blood occurs from the wound after the worm has\r\nfinished its meal and gone to another part of the intestine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A family suffering from hookworm.]\r\n\r\nThe cure of the disease is very easy; thymol is given, which weakens the\r\nhold of the worm, this being followed by Epsom salts. For years a large\r\narea in the South undoubtedly has been retarded in its development by this\r\nparasite; hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of lives have been\r\nneedlessly sacrificed.\r\n\r\n     \"The hookworm is not a bit spectacular: it doesn't get itself\r\n     discussed in legislative halls or furiously debated in political\r\n     campaigns. Modest and unassuming, it does not aspire to such dignity.\r\n     It is satisfied simply with (1) lowering the working efficiency and\r\n     the pleasure of living in something like two hundred thousand persons\r\n     in Georgia and all other Southern states in proportion; with (2)\r\n     amassing a death rate higher than tuberculosis, pneumonia, or typhoid\r\n     fever; with (3) stubbornly and quite effectually retarding the\r\n     agricultural and industrial development of the section; with (4)\r\n     nullifying the benefit of thousands of dollars spent upon education;\r\n     with (5) costing the South, in the course of a few decades, several\r\n     hundred millions of dollars. More serious and closer at hand than the\r\n     tariff; more costly, threatening, and tangible than the Negro problem;\r\n     making the menace of the boll weevil laughable in comparison--it is\r\n     preeminently the problem of the South.\"--_Atlanta Constitution._\r\n\r\nAnimals that prey upon Man.--The toll of death from animals which prey upon\r\nor harm man directly is relatively small. Snakes in tropical countries kill\r\nmany cattle and not a few people.\r\n\r\nThe bite of the rattlesnake of our own country, although dangerous, seldom\r\nkills. The dreaded cobra of India has a record of over two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand persons killed in the last thirty-five years. The Indian\r\ngovernment yearly pays out large sums for the extermination of venomous\r\nsnakes, over two hundred thousand of which have been killed during a single\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A flesh-eating reptile, the alligator.]\r\n\r\nAlligators and Crocodiles.--These feed on fishes, but often attack large\r\nanimals, as horses, cows, and even man. They seek their prey chiefly at\r\nnight, and spend the day basking in the sun. The crocodiles of the Ganges\r\nRiver in India levy a yearly tribute of many hundred lives from the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nCarnivorous animals such as lions and tigers still inflict damage in\r\ncertain parts of the world, but as the tide of civilization advances, their\r\nnumbers are slowly but surely decreasing so that as important factors in\r\nman's welfare they may be considered almost negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

THE FISH AND FROG, AN INTRODUCTORY STUDY OF VERTEBRATES\r\n\r\n_Problems._--_To determine how a fish and a frog are fitted for the life\r\n               they lead._\r\n             _To determine some methods of development in vertebrate animals._\r\n             _(a) Fishes._\r\n             _(b) Frogs._\r\n             _(c) Other animals._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Laboratory exercise._--Study of a living fish--adaptations\r\n       for protection, locomotion, food getting, etc.\r\n     _Laboratory demonstration._--The development of the fish or\r\n       frog egg.\r\n     _Visit to the aquarium._--Study of adaptations, economic\r\n       uses of fishes, artificial propagation of fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Methods of Breathing in Vertebrates.--Vertebrate animals have at least\r\ntwo methods of getting their oxygen. In other respects their life processes\r\nare nearly similar. Of all vertebrates fishes are the only ones fitted to\r\nbreathe all their lives under water. Other vertebrates are provided with\r\nlungs and take their oxygen directly from the air.[32] We will next take up\r\nthe study of a fish to see how it is fitted for its life in the water.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 32: With the exception of a few lungless\r\n     salamanders. Most salamanders get much of their supply of\r\n     oxygen through their moist skins.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF A FISH\r\n\r\nThe Body.--One of our common fresh-water fish is the bream, or golden\r\nshiner. The body of the bream runs insensibly into the head, the neck being\r\nabsent. The long, narrow body with its smooth surface fits the fish\r\nadmirably for its life in the water. Certain cells in the skin secrete\r\nmucus or slime, another adaptation. The position of the scales, overlapping\r\nin a backward direction, is yet another adaptation which aids in passing\r\nthrough the water. Its color, olive above and bright silver and gold below,\r\nis protective. Can you see how?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The bream. _A_, dorsal fin; _B_, caudal fin; _C_, anal fin;\r\n_D_, pelvic fin; _E_, pectoral fin.]\r\n\r\nThe Appendages and their Uses.--The appendages of the fish consist of\r\npaired and unpaired fins. The paired fins are four in number, and are\r\nbelieved to correspond in position and structure with the paired limbs of a\r\nman. Note the illustration above and locate the paired _pectoral_ and\r\n_pelvic_ fins. (These are so called because they are attached to the bones\r\nforming the pectoral and pelvic girdles. See page 268.) Find, by\r\ncomparison with the Figure, the _dorsal_, _anal_, and _caudal_ fins. How\r\nmany unpaired fins are there?\r\n\r\nThe flattened, muscular body of the fish, tapering toward the caudal fin,\r\nis moved from side to side with an undulating motion which results in the\r\nforward movement of the fish. This movement is almost identical with that\r\nof an oar in sculling a boat. Turning movements are brought about by use of\r\nthe lateral fins in much the same way as a boat is turned. We notice the\r\ndorsal and other single fins are evidently useful in balancing and\r\nsteering.\r\n\r\nThe Senses.--The position of the eyes at the side of the head is an evident\r\nadvantage to the fish. Why? The eye is globular in shape. Such an eye has\r\nbeen found to be very nearsighted. Thus it is unlikely that a fish is able\r\nto perceive objects at any great distance from it. The eyes are unprotected\r\nby eyelids, but the tough outer covering and their position afford some\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nFeeding experiments with fishes show that a fish becomes aware of the\r\npresence of food by smelling it as well as by seeing it. The nostrils of a\r\nfish can be proved to end in little pits, one under each nostril hole. Thus\r\nthey differ from our own, which are connected with the mouth cavity. In the\r\ncatfish, for example, the _barbels_, or horns, receive sensations of smell\r\nand taste. They do not perceive odors as we do for a fish perceives only\r\nsubstances that are dissolved in the water in which it lives. The senses of\r\ntaste and touch appear to be less developed than the other senses.\r\n\r\nAlong each side of most fishes is a line of tiny pits, provided with sense\r\norgans and connected with the central nervous system of the fish. This\r\narea, called the _lateral line_, is believed to be sensitive to mechanical\r\nstimuli of certain sorts. The \"ear\" of the fish is under the skin and\r\nserves partly as a balancing organ.\r\n\r\nFood Getting.--A fish must go after its food and seize it, but has no\r\nstructures for grasping except the teeth. Consequently we find the teeth\r\nsmall, sharp, and numerous, well adapted for holding living prey. The\r\ntongue in most fishes is wanting or very slightly developed.\r\n\r\nBreathing.--A fish, when swimming quietly or when at rest, seems to be\r\nbiting when no food is present. A reason for this act is to be seen when we\r\nintroduce a little finely powdered carmine into the water near the head of\r\nthe fish. It will be found that a current of water enters the mouth at each\r\nof these biting movements and passes out through two slits found on each\r\nside of the head of the fish. Investigation shows us that under the broad,\r\nflat plate, or _operculum_, forming each side of the head, lie several\r\nlong, feathery, red structures, the _gills_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of the gills of a fish. (_H_), the heart which\r\nforces the blood into the tubes (_V_), which run out into the gill\r\nfilaments. A gill bar (_G_) supports each gill. The blood after exchanging\r\nits carbon dioxide for oxygen is sent out to the cells of the body through\r\nthe artery (_A_).]\r\n\r\nGills.--If we examine the gills of any large fish, we find that a single\r\ngill is held in place by a bony arch, made of several pieces of bone which\r\nare hinged in such a way as to give great flexibility to the gill arch, as\r\nthe support is called. Covering the bony framework, and extending from it,\r\nare numerous delicate filaments covered with a very thin membrane or skin.\r\nInto each of these filaments pass two blood vessels; in one blood flows\r\ndownward and in the other upward. Blood reaches the gills and is carried\r\naway from these organs by means of two large vessels which pass along the\r\nbony arch previously mentioned. In the gill filament the blood comes into\r\ncontact with the free oxygen of the water bathing the gills. An exchange of\r\ngases through the walls of the gill filaments results in the loss of carbon\r\ndioxide and a gain of oxygen by the blood. The blood carries oxygen to the\r\ncells of the body and (as work is done by the cells as a result of the\r\noxidation of food) brings carbon dioxide back to the gills.\r\n\r\nGill Rakers.--If we open wide the mouth of any large fish and look inward,\r\nwe find that the mouth cavity leads to a funnel-like opening, the gullet.\r\nOn each side of the gullet we can see the gill arches, guarded on the inner\r\nside by a series of sharp-pointed structures, the _gill rakers_. In some\r\nfishes in which the teeth are not well developed, there seems to be a\r\ngreater development of the gill rakers, which in this case are used to\r\nstrain out small organisms from the water which passes over the gills. Many\r\nfishes make such use of the gill rakers. Such are the shad and menhaden,\r\nwhich feed almost entirely on _plankton_, a name given to the small plants\r\nand animals found by millions in the water.\r\n\r\nDigestive System.--The gullet leads directly into a baglike stomach. There\r\nare no salivary glands in the fishes. There is, however, a large liver,\r\nwhich appears to be used as a digestive gland. This organ, because of the\r\noil it contains, is in some fishes, as the cod, of considerable economic\r\nimportance. Many fishes have outgrowths like a series of pockets from the\r\nintestine. These structures, called the _pyloric caeca_, are believed to\r\nsecrete a digestive fluid. The intestine ends at the vent, which is usually\r\nlocated on the under side of the fish, immediately in front of the anal\r\nfin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A fish opened to show _H_, the heart; _G_, the gills; _L_,\r\nthe liver; _S_, the stomach; _I_, the intestine; _O_, the ovary; _K_, the\r\nkidney, and _B_, the air bladder.]\r\n\r\nSwim Bladder.--An organ of unusual significance, called the _swim bladder_,\r\noccupies the region just dorsal to the food tube. In young fishes of many\r\nspecies this is connected by a tube with the anterior end of the digestive\r\ntract. In some forms this tube persists throughout life, but in other\r\nfishes it becomes closed, a thin, fibrous cord taking its place. The swim\r\nbladder aids in giving the fish nearly the same weight as the water it\r\ndisplaces, thus buoying it up. The walls of the organ are richly supplied\r\nwith blood vessels, and it thus undoubtedly serves as an organ for\r\nsupplying oxygen to the blood when all other sources fail. In some fishes\r\n(the _dipnoi_, page 187) it has come to be used as a lung.\r\n\r\nCirculation of the Blood.--In the vertebrate animals the blood is said to\r\ncirculate in the body, because it passes through a more or less closed\r\nsystem of tubes in its course around the body. In the fishes the heart is a\r\ntwo-chambered muscular organ, a thin-walled _auricle_, the receiving\r\nchamber, leading into a thick-walled muscular _ventricle_ from which the\r\nblood is forced out. The blood is pumped from the heart to the gills; there\r\nit loses some of its carbon dioxide; it then passes on to other parts of\r\nthe body, eventually breaking up into very tiny tubes called _capillaries_.\r\nFrom the capillaries the blood returns, in tubes of gradually increasing\r\ndiameter, toward the heart again. The body cells lie between the smallest\r\nbranches of the capillaries. Thus they get from the blood food and oxygen\r\nand return to the blood the wastes resulting from oxidation within the cell\r\nbody. During its course some of the blood passes through the kidneys and is\r\nthere relieved of part of its nitrogenous waste. Circulation of blood in\r\nthe body of the fish is rather slow. The temperature of the blood being\r\nnearly that of the surrounding media in which the fish lives, the animal\r\nhas incorrectly been given the term \"cold-blooded.\"\r\n\r\nNervous System.--As in all other vertebrate animals, the brain and spinal\r\ncord of the fish are partially inclosed in bone. The central nervous system\r\nconsists of a _brain_, with nerves connecting the organs of sight, taste,\r\nsmell, and hearing, and such parts of the body as possess the sense of\r\ntouch; a _spinal cord_; and _spinal nerves_. Nerve cells located near the\r\noutside of the body send in messages to the central system, which are there\r\nreceived as sensations. Cells of the central nervous system, in turn, send\r\nout messages which result in the movement of muscles.\r\n\r\nSkeleton.--In the vertebrates, of which the bony fish is an example, the\r\nskeleton is under the skin, and is hence called an _endoskeleton_. It\r\nconsists of a bony framework, the vertebral column which protects the\r\nspinal cord and certain attached bones, the ribs, with other spiny bones to\r\nwhich the unpaired fins are attached. The paired fins are attached to the\r\nspinal column by two collections of bones, known respectively as the\r\n_pectoral_ and _pelvic girdles_. The bones in the main skeleton serve in\r\nthe fish for the attachment of powerful muscles, by means of which\r\nlocomotion is accomplished. In most fishes, the _exoskeleton_, too, is well\r\ndeveloped, consisting usually of scales, but sometimes of bony plates.\r\n\r\nFood of Fishes.--We have already seen that in a balanced aquarium the\r\nbalance of food was preserved by the plants, which furnished food for the\r\ntiny animals or were eaten by larger ones,--for example, snails or fish.\r\nThe smaller animals in turn became food of larger ones. The nitrogen\r\nbalance was maintained through the excretions of the animals and their\r\ndeath and decay.\r\n\r\nThe marine world is a great balanced aquarium. The upper layer of water is\r\ncrowded with all kinds of little organisms, both plant and animal. Some of\r\nthese are microscopic in size; others, as the tiny crustaceans, are visible\r\nto the eye. On these little organisms some fish feed entirely, others in\r\npart. Such are the menhaden[33] (bony, bunker, mossbunker of our coast),\r\nthe shad, and others. Other fishes are bottom feeders, as the blackfish and\r\nthe sea bass, living almost entirely upon mollusks and crustaceans. Still\r\nothers are hunters, feeding upon smaller species of fish, or even upon\r\ntheir weaker brothers. Such are the bluefish, squeteague or weakfish, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 33: It has been discovered by Professor Mead of\r\n     Brown University that the increase in starfish along certain\r\n     parts of the New England coast was in part due to\r\n     overfishing of menhaden, which at certain times in the year\r\n     feed almost entirely on the young starfish.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of salt-water fish is equally true of those inhabiting our\r\nfresh-water streams and lakes. It is one of the greatest problems of our\r\nBureau of Fisheries to discover this relation of various fishes to their\r\nfood supplies so as to aid in the conservation and balance of life in our\r\nlakes, rivers, and seas.\r\n\r\nMigration of Fishes.--Some fishes change their habitat at different times\r\nduring the year, moving in vast schools northward in summer and southward\r\nin the winter. In a general way such migrations follow the coast lines.\r\nExamples of such migratory fish are the cod, menhaden, herring, and\r\nbluefish. The migrations are due to temperature changes, to the seeking\r\nafter food, and to the spawning instinct. Some fish migrate to shallower\r\nwater in the summer and to deeper water in the winter; here the reason for\r\nthe migration is doubtless the change in temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Development of a trout. 1, the embryo within the egg; 2, the\r\nyoung fish just hatched with the yoke sac still attached; 3, the young\r\nfish.]\r\n\r\nThe Egg-laying Habits of the Bony Fishes.--The eggs of most bony fishes are\r\nlaid in great numbers, varying from a few thousand in the trout to many\r\nhundreds of thousands in the shad and several millions in the cod. The time\r\nof egg-laying is usually spring or early summer. At the time of spawning\r\nthe male usually deposits milt, consisting of millions of sperm cells, in\r\nthe water just over the eggs, thus accomplishing fertilization. Some\r\nfishes, as sticklebacks, sunfish, toadfish, etc., make nests, but usually\r\nthe eggs are left to develop by themselves, sometimes attached to some\r\nsubmerged object, but more frequently free in the water. In some eggs a\r\ntiny oil drop buoys up the egg to the surface, where the heat of the sun\r\naids development. They are exposed to many dangers, and both eggs and\r\ndeveloping fish are eaten, not only by birds, fish of other species, and\r\nother water inhabitants, but also by their own relatives, and even parents.\r\nConsequently a very small percentage of eggs ever produce mature fish.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of the Spawning Habits to Economic Importance of Fish.--The\r\nspawning habits of fish are of great importance to us because of the\r\neconomic value of fish to mankind, not only directly as a food, but\r\nindirectly as food for other animals in turn valuable to man. Many of our\r\nmost desirable food fishes, notably the salmon, shad, sturgeon, and smelt,\r\npass up rivers from the ocean to deposit their eggs, swimming against\r\nstrong currents much of the way, some species leaping rapids and falls, in\r\norder to deposit their eggs in localities where the conditions of water and\r\nfood are suitable, and the water shallow enough to allow the sun's rays to\r\nwarm it sufficiently to cause the eggs to develop. The Chinook salmon of\r\nthe Pacific coast, the salmon used in the Western canning industry, travels\r\nover a thousand miles up the Columbia and other rivers, where it spawns.\r\nThe salmon begin to pass up the rivers in early spring, and reach the\r\nspawning beds, shallow deposits of gravel in cool mountain streams, before\r\nlate summer. Here the fish, both males and females, remain until the\r\ntemperature of the water falls to about 54 deg. Fahrenheit. The eggs and milt\r\nare then deposited, and the old fish die, leaving the eggs to be hatched\r\nout later by the heat of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nNeed of Conservation.--The instinct of this and other species of fish to go\r\ninto shallow rivers to deposit their eggs has been made use of by man. At\r\nthe time of the spawning migration the salmon are taken in vast numbers,\r\nfor the salmon fisheries net over $16,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\nBut the need for conservation of this important national asset is great.\r\nThe shad have within recent time abandoned their breeding places in the\r\nConnecticut River, and the salmon have been exterminated along our eastern\r\ncoast within the past few decades. It is only a matter of a few years when\r\nthe Western salmon will be extinct if fishing is continued at the present\r\nrate. More fish must be allowed to reach their breeding places. To do this\r\na closed season on the rivers of two or three days out of each seven while\r\nthe shad or the salmon run would do much good.\r\n\r\nThe sturgeon, the eggs of which are used in the manufacture of the delicacy\r\nknown as _caviar_, is an example of a fish that is almost extinct in this\r\npart of the world. Other food fish taken at the breeding season are also in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Artificial fertilization of fish eggs.]\r\n\r\nArtificial Propagation of Fishes.--Fortunately, the government through the\r\nBureau of Fisheries, and various states by wise protective laws and by\r\nartificial propagation of fishes, are beginning to turn the tide. Certain\r\ndays of the week the salmon are allowed to pass up the Columbia unmolested.\r\nClosed breeding seasons protect our trout, bass, and other game fish, also\r\nthe catching of fish under a certain size is prohibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Early development of salmon. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nMany fish hatcheries, both government and state, are engaged in\r\nartificially fertilizing millions of fish eggs of various species and\r\nprotecting the young fry until they are of such size that they can take\r\ncare of themselves, when they are placed in ponds or streams. This\r\nartificial fertilization is usually accomplished by first squeezing out the\r\nripe eggs from a female into a pan of water; in a similar manner the milt\r\nor sperm cells are obtained, and poured over the eggs. The eggs are thus\r\nfertilized. They are then placed in receptacles supplied with running water\r\nand left to develop under favorable conditions. Shortly after the egg has\r\nsegmented (divided into many cells) the embryo may be seen developing on\r\none side of the egg. The rest of the egg is made up of food or yolk, and\r\nwhen the baby fish hatches it has for some time the yolk attached to its\r\nventral surface. Eventually the food is absorbed into the body of the fish.\r\nThe development of the fish is direct, the young fish becoming an adult\r\nwithout any great change in form. The young fry are kept under ideal\r\nconditions until later, when they are shipped, sometimes thousands of\r\nmiles, to their new homes.\r\n\r\nNOTE TO TEACHER.--It is suggested that in the spring term the frog be\r\nstudied, but if animal biology be taken up during the fall term the fish\r\nonly might be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FROG\r\n\r\nAdaptations for Life.--The most common frog in the eastern part of the\r\nUnited States is the leopard frog. It is recognized by its greenish brown\r\nbody with dark spots, each spot being outlined in a lighter-colored\r\nbackground. In spite of the apparent lack of harmony with their\r\nsurroundings, their color appears to give almost perfect protection. In\r\nsome species of frogs the color of the skin changes with the surroundings\r\nof the frog, another means of protection.\r\n\r\nAdaptations for life in the water are numerous. The ovoid body, the head\r\nmerging into the trunk, the slimy covering (for the frog is provided, like\r\nthe fish, with mucus cells in the skin), and the powerful legs with webbed\r\nfeet, are all evidences of the life which the frog leads.\r\n\r\nLocomotion.--You will notice that the appendages have the same general\r\nposition on the body and same number of parts as do your own (upper arm,\r\nforearm, and hand; thigh, shank, and foot, the latter much longer\r\nrelatively than your own). Note that while the hand has four fingers, the\r\nfoot has five toes, the latter connected by a web. In swimming the frog\r\nuses the stroke we all aim to make when we are learning to swim. Most of\r\nthe energy is liberated from the powerful backward push of the hind legs,\r\nwhich in a resting position are held doubled up close to the body. On land,\r\nlocomotion may be by hopping or crawling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This diagram shows how the frog uses its tongue to catch\r\ninsects.]\r\n\r\nSense Organs.--The frog is well provided with sense organs. The eyes are\r\nlarge, globular, and placed at the side of the head. When they are closed,\r\na delicate fold, or third eyelid, called the _nictitating membrane_, is\r\ndrawn over each eye. Frogs probably see best moving objects at a few feet\r\nfrom them. Their vision is much keener than that of the fish. The external\r\near (_tympanum_) is located just behind the eye on the side of the body.\r\nFrogs hear sounds and distinguish various calls of their own kind, as is\r\nproved by the fact that frogs recognize the warning notes of their mates\r\nwhen any one is approaching. The inner ear also has to do with balancing\r\nthe body as it has in fishes and other vertebrates. Taste and smell are\r\nprobably not strong sensations in a frog or toad. They bite at moving\r\nobjects of almost any kind when hungry. The long flexible tongue, which is\r\nfastened at the front, is used to catch insects. Experience has taught\r\nthese animals that moving things, insects, worms, and the like, make good\r\nfood. These they swallow whole, the tiny teeth being used to hold the food.\r\nTouch is a well-developed sense. They also respond to changes in\r\ntemperature under water, remaining there in a dormant state for the winter\r\nwhen the temperature of the air becomes colder than that of the water.\r\n\r\nBreathing.--The frog breathes by raising and lowering the floor of the\r\nmouth, pulling in air through the two nostril holes. Then the little flaps\r\nover the holes are closed, and the frog swallows this air, forcing it down\r\ninto the baglike lungs. The skin is provided with many tiny blood vessels,\r\nand in winter, while the frogs are dormant at the bottom of the ponds, it\r\nserves as the only organ of respiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Internal organs of a frog: M, mouth; T, tongue; Lu, lungs;\r\nH, heart; St, stomach; I, small intestine; L, liver; G, gall bladder; P,\r\npancreas; C, cloaca; B, urinary bladder; S, spleen; K, kidney; Od, oviduct;\r\nO, ovary; Br, brain; Sc, spinal cord; Ba, back bone.]\r\n\r\nThe Food Tube and its Glands.--The mouth leads like a funnel into a short\r\ntube, the _gullet_. On the lower floor of the mouth can be seen the\r\nslitlike _glottis_ leading to the lungs. The gullet widens almost at once\r\ninto a long _stomach_, which in turn leads into a much coiled intestine.\r\nThis widens abruptly at the lower end to form the _large intestine_. The\r\nlatter leads into the _cloaca_ (Latin, _sewer_), into which open the\r\n_kidneys_, _urinary bladder_, and reproductive organs (_ovaries_ or\r\n_spermaries_). Several _glands_, the function of which is to produce\r\ndigestive fluids, open into the food tube. These digestive fluids, by means\r\nof the ferments or enzymes contained in them, change insoluble food\r\nmaterials into a soluble form. This allows of the absorption of food\r\nmaterial through the walls of the food tube into the blood. The glands\r\n(having the same names and uses as those in man) are the _salivary glands_,\r\nwhich pour their juices into the mouth, the _gastric glands_ in the walls\r\nof the stomach, and the _liver_ and _pancreas_, which open into the\r\nintestine.\r\n\r\nCirculation.--The frog has a well-developed heart, composed of a\r\nthick-walled muscular ventricle and two thin-walled auricles. The heart\r\npumps the blood through a system of closed tubes to all parts of the body.\r\nBlood enters the right auricle from all parts of the body; it then contains\r\nconsiderable carbon dioxide; the blood entering the left auricle comes from\r\nthe lungs, hence it contains a considerable amount of oxygen. Blood leaves\r\nthe heart through the ventricle, which thus pumps some blood containing\r\nmuch and some containing little oxygen. Before the blood from the tissues\r\nand lungs has time to mix, however, it leaves the ventricle and by a\r\ndelicate adjustment in the vessels leaving the heart most of the blood\r\ncontaining much oxygen is passed to all the various organs of the body,\r\nwhile the blood deficient in oxygen, but containing a large amount of\r\ncarbon dioxide, is pumped to the lungs, where an exchange of oxygen and\r\ncarbon dioxide takes place by osmosis.\r\n\r\nIn the tissues of the body wherever work is done the process of burning or\r\noxidation must take place, for by such means only is the energy necessary\r\nto do the work released. Food in the blood is taken to the muscle cells or\r\nother cells of the body and there oxidized. The products of the\r\nburning--carbon dioxide--and any other organic wastes given off from the\r\ntissues must be eliminated from the body. As we know, the carbon dioxide\r\npasses off through the lungs and to some extent through the skin of the\r\nfrog, while the nitrogenous wastes, poisons which must be taken from the\r\nblood, are eliminated from it in the kidneys.\r\n\r\nChange of Form in Development of the Frog.--Not all vertebrates develop\r\ndirectly into an adult. The frog, for example, changes its form completely\r\nbefore it becomes an adult. This change in form is known as a\r\n_metamorphosis_. Let us examine the development of the common leopard frog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Development of a frog. 1, two cell stage; 2, four cell\r\nstage; 3, 8 cells are formed, notice the upper cells are smaller; in (4)\r\nthe lower cells are seen to be much larger because of the yolk; 5, the egg\r\nhas continued to divide and has formed a gastrula; 6, 7, the body is\r\nlengthening, head is seen at the right hand end; 8, the young tadpole with\r\nexternal gills; 9, 10, the gills are internal, hind legs beginning to form;\r\n11, the hind legs show plainly; 12, 13, 14, later stages in development;\r\n15, the adult frog. Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are very much enlarged.\r\n(Drawn after Leukart and Kny by Frank M. Wheat.)]\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this frog are laid in shallow water in the early spring. Masses\r\nof several hundred, which may be found attached to twigs or other supports\r\nunder water, are deposited at a single laying. Immediately before leaving\r\nthe body of the female they receive a coating of jellylike material, which\r\nswells up after the eggs are laid. Thus they are protected from the attack\r\nof fish or other animals which might use them as food. The upper side of\r\nthe egg is dark, the light-colored side being weighted down with a supply\r\nof yolk (food). The fertilized egg soon segments (divides into many cells),\r\nand in a few days, if the weather is warm, these eggs have each grown into\r\nan oblong body which shows the form of a tadpole. Shortly after the tadpole\r\nwriggles out of the jellylike case and begins life outside the egg. At\r\nfirst it remains attached to some water weed by means of a pair of\r\nsuckerlike projections; later a mouth is formed, and the tadpole begins to\r\nfeed upon algae or other tiny water plants. At this time, about two weeks\r\nafter the eggs were laid, gills are present on the outside of the body.\r\nSoon after, the external gills are replaced by gills which grow out under a\r\nfold of the skin which forms an operculum somewhat as in the fish. Water\r\nreaches the gills through the mouth and passes out through a hole on the\r\nleft side of the body. As the tadpole grows larger, legs appear, the hind\r\nlegs first, although for a time locomotion is performed by means of the\r\ntail. In the leopard frog the change from the egg to adult is completed in\r\none summer. In late July or early August, the tadpole begins to eat less,\r\nthe tail becomes smaller (being absorbed into other parts of the body), and\r\nbefore long the transformation from the tadpole to the young frog is\r\ncomplete. In the green frog and bullfrog the metamorphosis is not completed\r\nuntil the beginning of the second summer. The large tadpoles of such forms\r\nbury themselves in the soft mud of the pond bottom during the winter.\r\n\r\nShortly after the legs appear, the gills begin to be absorbed, and lungs\r\ntake their place. At this time the young animal may be seen coming to the\r\nsurface of the water for air. Changes in the diet of the animal also occur;\r\nthe long, coiled intestine is transformed into a much shorter one. The\r\nanimal, now insectivorous in its diet, becomes provided with tiny teeth and\r\na mobile tongue, instead of keeping the horny jaws used in scraping off\r\nalgae. After the tail has been completely absorbed and the legs have become\r\nfull grown, there is no further structural change, and the metamorphosis is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: At the left is a hen's egg, opened to show the embryo at the\r\ncenter (the spot surrounded by a lighter area). At the right is an English\r\nsparrow one day after hatching.]\r\n\r\nDevelopment of Birds.--The white of the hen's egg is put on during the\r\npassage of the real egg (which is in the yolk or yellow portion) to the\r\noutside of the body. Before the egg is laid a shell is secreted over its\r\nsurface. If the fertilized egg of a hen be broken and carefully examined,\r\non the surface of the yolk will be found a little circular disk. This is\r\nthe beginning of the growth of an _embryo_ chick. If a series of eggs taken\r\nfrom an incubator at periods of twenty-four hours or less apart were\r\nexamined, this spot would be found at first to increase in size; later the\r\nlittle embryo would be found lying on the surface. Still later small blood\r\nvessels could be made out reaching into the yolk for food, the tiny heart\r\nbeating as early as the second day of incubation. After about three weeks\r\nof incubation the little chick hatches; that is, breaks the shell, and\r\nemerges in almost the same form as the adult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The embryo (_e_) of a mammal, showing the absorbing organ in\r\nblack, the branch-like processes which absorb blood from the mother being\r\nshown at (_v_); _ct_, the tube connecting the embryo with the absorbing\r\norgan or placenta.]\r\n\r\nDevelopment of a Mammal.--In mammals after fertilization the egg undergoes\r\ndevelopment within the body of the mother. Instead of blood vessels\r\nconnecting the embryo with the yolk as in the chick, here the blood vessels\r\nare attached to an absorbing organ, known as the _placenta_. This structure\r\nsends branch-like processes into the wall of the _uterus_ (the organ which\r\nholds the embryo) and absorbs nourishment and oxygen by osmosis from the\r\nblood of the mother. After a length of time which varies in different\r\nspecies of mammals (from about three weeks in a guinea pig to twenty-two\r\nmonths in an elephant), the young animal is expelled by muscular\r\ncontraction of the uterus, or is born. The young, usually, are born in a\r\nhelpless condition, then nourished by milk furnished by the mother until\r\nthey are able to take other food. Thus we see as we go higher in the scale\r\nof life fewer eggs formed, but those few eggs are more carefully protected\r\nand cared for by the parents. The chances of their growth into adults are\r\nmuch greater than in the cases when many eggs are produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

HEREDITY, VARIATION, PLANT AND ANIMAL BREEDING\r\n\r\n_Problems.--To determine what makes the offspring of animals or plants\r\n              tend to be like their parents._\r\n           _To determine what makes the offspring of animals and plants\r\n              differ from their parents._\r\n           _To learn about some methods of plant and animal breeding._\r\n             _(a) By selection._\r\n             _(b) By hybridizing._\r\n             _(c) By other methods._\r\n           _To learn about some methods of improving the human race._\r\n             _(a) By eugenics._\r\n             _(b) By euthenics._\r\n\r\n                   SUGGESTIONS FOR LABORATORY WORK\r\n\r\n     _Laboratory exercise._--On variation and heredity among members of a\r\n       class in the schoolroom.\r\n     _Laboratory exercise._--On construction of curve of variation in\r\n       measurements from given plants or animals.\r\n     _Laboratory demonstration._--Stained egg cells (_ascaris_) to show\r\n       chromosomes.\r\n     _Laboratory demonstrations._--To illustrate the part played in plant\r\n       or animal breeding by\r\n       (_a_) selection.\r\n       (_b_) hybridizing.\r\n       (_c_) budding and grafting.\r\n     _Laboratory demonstration._--From charts to illustrate how human\r\n       characteristics may be inherited.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEREDITY AND EUGENICS\r\n\r\nHeredity and what it Means.--As I look over the faces of the boys in my\r\nclass I notice that each boy seems to be more or less like each other boy\r\nin the class; he has a head, body, arms, and legs, and even in minor ways\r\nhe resembles each of the other boys in the room. Moreover, if I should ask\r\nhim I have no doubt but that he would tell me that he resembled in many\r\nrespects his mother or father. Likewise if I should ask his _parents_ whom\r\nhe resembled, they would say, \"I can see his grandmother or his grandfather\r\nin him.\"\r\n\r\nThis wonderful force which causes the likeness of the child to its parents\r\nand to _their_ parents we call _heredity_. Heredity causes the plants as\r\nwell as animals to be like their parents. If we trace the workings of\r\nheredity in our own individual case, we will probably find that we are\r\nmolded like our ancestors not only in physical characteristics but in\r\nmental qualities as well. The ability to play the piano or to paint is\r\nprobably as much a case of inheritance as the color of our eyes or the\r\nshape of our nose. We are a complex of physical and mental characters,\r\nreceived in part from all our ancestors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Variations in the Catalpa caterpillar. (Photographed,\r\nnatural size, by Davison.)]\r\n\r\nVariation.--But I notice another thing; no boy in the class before me is\r\n_exactly_ like any other boy, even twins having minute differences. In this\r\nwonderful mold of nature each one of us tends to be slightly different from\r\nhis or her parents. Each plant, each animal, varies to a greater or lesser\r\ndegree from its immediate ancestors and may vary to a very great degree.\r\nThis factor in the lives of plants and animals is called _variation_.\r\nHeredity and variation are the cornerstones on which all the work in the\r\nimprovement of plants and animals, including man himself, are built.\r\n\r\nThe Bearers of Heredity.--We have seen that somewhere in every living cell\r\nis a structure known as a nucleus. In this nucleus, which is a part of the\r\nliving matter of the cell, are certain very minute structures always\r\npresent, known as _chromosomes_. These chromosomes (so called because they\r\ntake up color when stained) are believed to be the structures which contain\r\nthe _determiners_ of the qualities which may be passed from parent plant to\r\noffspring or from animal to animal; in other words, the qualities that are\r\ninheritable (see page 252).\r\n\r\nThe Germ Cells.--But it has been found that certain cells of the body, the\r\negg and the sperm cells, before uniting contain only half as many\r\nchromosomes as do the body cells. In preparing for the process of\r\nfertilization, half of these elements have been eliminated, so that when\r\nthe egg and sperm cell are united they will have the full number of\r\nchromosomes that the other cells have.\r\n\r\nIf the chromosomes carry the determiners of the characters which are\r\ninheritable, then it is easy to see that a fertilized egg must contain an\r\nequal number of chromosomes from the bodies of each parent. Consequently\r\ncharacteristics from each parent are handed down to the new individual.\r\nThis seems to be the way in which nature succeeds in obtaining variation,\r\nby providing cell material from two different individuals.\r\n\r\nOffspring are Part of their Ancestors.--We can see that if you or I receive\r\ncharacteristics from our parents and they received characteristics from\r\ntheir parents, then we too must have some of the characteristics of the\r\ngrandparents, and it is a matter of common knowledge that each of us does\r\nhave some trait or lineament which can be traced back to our grandfather or\r\ngrandmother. Indeed, as far back as we are able to go, ancestors have added\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPARISON OF SEXUAL AND ASEXUAL CELL REPRODUCTION]\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin and Natural Selection.--The great Englishman Charles Darwin\r\nwas one of the first scientists to realize how this great force of heredity\r\napplied to the development or evolution of plants and animals. He knew that\r\nalthough animals and plants were like their ancestors, they also tended to\r\nvary. In nature, the variations which best fitted a plant or animal for\r\nlife in its own environment were the ones which were handed down because\r\nthose having variations which were not fitted for life in that particular\r\nenvironment would die. Thus nature seized upon favorable variations and\r\nafter a time, as the descendants of each of these individuals also tended\r\nto vary, a new species of plant or animal, fitted for the place it had to\r\nlive in, would be gradually evolved.\r\n\r\nMutations.--Recently a new method of variation has been discovered by a\r\nDutch naturalist, named Hugo de Vries. He found that new species of plants\r\nand animals arise suddenly by \"mutations\" or steps. This means that new\r\nspecies instead of arising from very slight variations, continuing during\r\nlong periods of years (as Darwin believed), might arise very suddenly as a\r\nvery great variation which would at once breed true. It is easily seen that\r\nsuch a condition would be of immense value to breeders, as new plants or\r\nanimals quite unlike their parents might thus be formed and perpetuated. It\r\nwill be one of the future problems of plant and animal breeders to isolate\r\nand breed \"mutants,\" as such organisms are called.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Improvement in corn by selection. To the left, the corn\r\nimproved by selection from the original type at the right.]\r\n\r\nArtificial Selection.--Darwin reasoned that if nature seized upon favorable\r\nvariants, then man, by selecting the variations he wanted, could form new\r\nvarieties of plants or animals much more quickly than nature. And so to-day\r\nplant or animal breeders _select_ the forms having the characters they wish\r\nto perpetuate and breed them together. This method used by plant and animal\r\nbreeders is known as _selection_.\r\n\r\nSelective Planting.--_By selective planting we mean choosing the best\r\nplants and planting the seed from these plants with a view of improving the\r\nyield._ In doing this we must not necessarily select the most perfect\r\nfruits or grains, but must select seeds from the _best plants_. A wheat\r\nplant should be selected not from its yield alone, but from its ability to\r\nstand disease and other unfavorable conditions. In 1862 a Mr. Fultz, of\r\nPennsylvania, found three heads of beardless or bald wheat while passing\r\nthrough a large field of bearded wheat. These were probably _mutants_ which\r\nhad lost the chaff surrounding the kernel. Mr. Fultz picked them out, sowed\r\nthem by themselves, and produced a quantity of wheat now known favorably\r\nall over the world as the Fultz wheat. In selecting wheat, for example, we\r\nmight breed for a number of different characters, such as more starch, or\r\nmore protein in the grain, a larger yield per acre, ability to stand cold\r\nor drought or to resist plant disease. Each of these characters would have\r\nto be sought for separately and could only be obtained after long and\r\ncareful breeding. The work of Mendel (see page 257) when applied to plant\r\nbreeding will greatly shorten the time required to produce better plants of\r\na given kind. By careful seed selection, some Western farmers have\r\nincreased their wheat production by 25 per cent. This, if kept up all over\r\nthe United States, would mean over $100,000,000 a year in the pockets of\r\nthe farmers.\r\n\r\nHybridizing.--We have already seen that pollen from one flower may be\r\ncarried to another of the same species, thus producing seeds. If pollen\r\nfrom one plant be placed on the pistil of another of an _allied_ species or\r\nvariety, fertilization _may_ take place and new plants be eventually\r\nproduced from the seeds. This process is known as _hybridizing_, and the\r\nplants produced by this process known as _hybrids_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In hybridizing, all of the flower is removed at the line\r\n(_W_) except the pistil (_P_). Then pollen from another flower of a nearly\r\nrelated kind is placed on the pistil and the pollinated flower covered up\r\nwith a paper bag. Can you explain why?]\r\n\r\nHybrids are extremely variable, rarely breed from seeds, and often are\r\napparently quite unlike either parent plant. They must be grown for several\r\nyears, and all plants that do not resemble the desired variety must be\r\nkilled off, if we expect to produce a hybrid that will breed more plants\r\nlike itself. Luther Burbank, the great hybridizer of California, destroys\r\ntens of thousands of plants in order to get one or two with the characters\r\nwhich he wishes to preserve. Thus he is yearly adding to the wealth of this\r\ncountry by producing new plants or fruits of commercial value. A number of\r\nyears ago he succeeded in growing a new variety of potato, which has\r\nalready enriched the farmers of this country about $20,000,000. One of his\r\nvarieties of black walnut trees, a very valuable hard wood, grows ten to\r\ntwelve times as rapidly as ordinary black walnuts. With lumber yearly\r\nincreasing in price, a quick growing tree becomes a very valuable\r\ncommercial product. Among his famous hybrids are the plumcot, a cross\r\nbetween an apricot and a plum, his numerous varieties of berries and his\r\nsplendid \"Climax\" plum, the result of a cross between a bitter Chinese plum\r\nand an edible Japanese plum. But none of Burbank's products grow from\r\nseeds; they are all produced _asexually_, from hybrids by some of the\r\nprocesses described in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture and its Methods.--The Department of\r\nAgriculture is also doing splendid work in producing new varieties of\r\noranges and lemons, of grain and various garden vegetables. The greatest\r\npossibilities have been shown by department workers to be open to the\r\nfarmer or fruit grower through hybridizing, and by budding, grafting, or\r\nslipping.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steps in budding. _a_, twig having suitable buds to use;\r\n_b_, method of cutting out bud; _c_, how the bark is cut; _d_, how the bark\r\nis opened; _e_, inserting the bud; _f_, the bud in place; _g_, the bud\r\nproperly bound in place.]\r\n\r\n_Budding._--If a given tree, for example, produces a kind of fruit which is\r\nof excellent quality, it is possible sometimes to attach parts of the tree\r\nto another strong tree of the same species that may not bear good fruit.\r\nThis is done by _budding_. A T-shaped incision is cut in the bark; a bud\r\nfrom the tree bearing the desired fruit is placed in the cut and bound in\r\nplace. When a shoot from the embedded bud grows out the following spring,\r\nit is found to have all the characters of the tree from which it was taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steps in tongue grafting. _a_, the two branches to be\r\nformed; _b_, a tongue cut in each; _c_, fitted together; _d_, method of\r\nwrapping.]\r\n\r\nGrafting.--Of much the same nature is grafting. Here, however, a small\r\nportion of the stem of the closely allied tree is fastened into the trunk\r\nof the growing tree in such a manner that the two cut layers just under the\r\nbark will coincide. This will allow of the passage of food into the grafted\r\npart and insure the ultimate growth of the twig. Grafting and budding are\r\nof considerable economic value to the fruit grower, as it enables him to\r\nproduce at will, trees bearing choice varieties of fruit.[34]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 34: For full directions for budding and grafting,\r\n     see Goff and Mayne, _First Principles of Agriculture_, Chap.\r\n     XIX, Mayne and Hatch, _High School Agriculture_, pp.\r\n     159-165, or Hodge, _Nature Study and Life_, pages 169-179.\r\n\r\nOther Methods.--Other methods of plant propagation are by means of runners,\r\nas when strawberry plants strike root from long stems that run along the\r\nground; layering, where roots may develop on covered up branches of\r\nblackberry or raspberry plants; slips, roots developing from stems which\r\nare cut off and placed in moist sand; from tubers, as in planting potatoes;\r\nand by means of bulbs, as the tulip or hyacinth. All of the above means of\r\npropagation are asexual and are of importance in our problem of plant\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plant breeding plots. (Minnesota Experiment Station.)]\r\n\r\nThe Work of Gregor Mendel.--Fifty years ago, an Austrian monk, Gregor\r\nMendel, found in breeding garden peas that these plants passed on certain\r\n_fixed characters_, as the shape of the seed, the color of the pod when\r\nripe, and others, and that when two pea plants of different characters were\r\ncrossed, one of these characters would be likely to appear in the offspring\r\nof the second generation in the ratio of three to one. Such characters as\r\nwould appear to the exclusion of others in the first crossing of the plants\r\nwere called _dominant_, the ones not appearing, _recessive_\r\ncharacteristics. When these seeds were again sown the ones bearing a\r\nrecessive characteristic would produce only peas with this recessive\r\ncharacteristic, but the ones with a dominant characteristic might give rise\r\nto a pure dominant or to offspring having partly a dominant and partly a\r\nrecessive character; pure dominants being to the mixed offspring in the\r\nratio of 1 to 2. The pure dominants if bred with others like themselves\r\nwould produce only pure dominants, but the cross breeds would again produce\r\nmixed offspring of three kinds in the ratio of one dominant to two cross\r\nbreeds and one recessive. The feature of this work that interests us is\r\nthat _unit_ characters are passed along by heredity in the germ cells\r\n_pure_, that is, unchanged, from one generation to another, and\r\nindependently of each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illustration of Mendel's Law.]\r\n\r\nDeterminers of Character.--A child then resembles his parents in some\r\ndefinite particulars because certain _determiners_ of characters have been\r\npresent in the germ cells of one of the parents. If the determiner of a\r\ncertain character is _absent_ from the germ cells of both parents, it will\r\nbe _absent_ in _all_ of their offspring.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries of Mendel are of the greatest importance in plant and\r\nanimal breeding because they enable the breeder to isolate certain\r\ncharacters and by proper selection to breed varieties which have these\r\ndesired characters, instead of waiting for a _chance_ union of the desired\r\ncharacters by nature.\r\n\r\nAnimal Breeding.--It has been pointed out that the domestication of wild\r\nanimals, the horse, cattle, sheep, goats, and the dog, marked a great\r\nadvance in civilization in the history of the earth's peoples. As the young\r\nof these animals came to be bred in captivity the peoples owning them would\r\nundoubtedly pick out the strongest and best of the offspring, killing off\r\nthe others for food. Thus they came unconsciously to select and aid nature\r\nin producing a stronger and better stock. Later man began to recognize\r\ncertain characters that he wished to have in horses, dogs, or cattle, and\r\nso by slow processes of breeding and \"crossing\" or hybridizing one nearly\r\nallied form with another the numerous groups of domesticated animals began\r\nto appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: What has resulted from artificial selection among dogs.\r\n(After Romanes.)]\r\n\r\nIn Darwin's time animal breeding was so far advanced that he got his ideas\r\nof selection by nature in evolution from the artificial selection practiced\r\nby animal breeders. A glance at the pictures will give some idea of the\r\nchanges that have taken place in the form of some animals since man began\r\nto breed them a few thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The four-toed ancestor of the present horse, restored from a\r\nstudy of its fossil skeleton. (After Knight in American Museum of Natural\r\nHistory.)]\r\n\r\nSome Domesticated Animals.--Our domesticated dogs are descended from a\r\nnumber of wolflike forms in various parts of the world. All the present\r\nraces of cats, on the other hand, seem to be traced back to Egypt. Modern\r\nhorses are first noted in Europe and Asia, but far older forms flourished\r\non the earth in former geologic periods. It is interesting to note that\r\nAmerica was the original home of the horse, although at the time of the\r\nearliest explorers the horse was unknown here, the wild horse of the\r\nWestern plains having arisen from horses introduced by the Spaniards. Long\r\nages ago, the first ancestors of the horse were probably little animals\r\nabout the size of a fox. The earliest horse we have knowledge of had four\r\ntoes on the fore and three toes on the hind foot. Thousands of years later\r\nwe find a larger horse, the size of a sheep, with a three-toed foot. By\r\ngradual changes, caused by the tendency of the animals to vary and by the\r\naction of the surroundings upon the animal in preserving these variations,\r\nthere was eventually produced our present horse, an animal with legs\r\nadapted for rapid locomotion, with feet particularly fitted for the life in\r\nopen fields, and with teeth which serve well to seize and grind herbage.\r\nKnowledge of this sort was also used by Darwin to show that constant\r\nchanges in the form of animals have been taking place since life began on\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe horse, which for some reason disappeared in this country, continued to\r\nexist in Europe, and man, emerging from his early savage condition, began\r\nto make use of the animal. We know the horse was domesticated in early\r\nBiblical times, and that he soon became one of man's most valued servants.\r\nIn more recent times, man has begun to change the horse by breeding for\r\ncertain desired characteristics. In this manner have been established and\r\nimproved the various types of horses familiar to us as draft horses, coach\r\nhorses, hackneys, and the trotters.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that all the various domesticated animals have been\r\ntremendously changed in a similar manner since civilized man has come to\r\nlive on the earth. When we realize the very great amount of money invested\r\nin domesticated animals; that there are over 60,000,000 each of sheep,\r\ncattle, and swine and over 20,000,000 horses owned in this country, then we\r\nmay see how very important a part the domestic animals play in our lives.\r\n\r\nImprovement of Man.--If the stock of domesticated animals can be improved,\r\nit is not unfair to ask if the health and vigor of the future generations\r\nof men and women on the earth might not be improved by applying to them the\r\nlaws of selection. This improvement of the future race has a number of\r\nfactors in which we as individuals may play a part. These are personal\r\nhygiene, selection of healthy mates, and the betterment of the environment.\r\n\r\nPersonal Hygiene.--In the first place, good health is the one greatest\r\nasset in life. We may be born with a poor bodily machine, but if we learn\r\nto recognize its defects and care for it properly, we may make it do its\r\nrequired work effectively. If certain muscles are poorly developed, then by\r\nproper exercise we may make them stronger. If our eyes have some defect, we\r\ncan have it remedied by wearing glasses. If certain drugs or alcohol lower\r\nthe efficiency of the machine, we can avoid their use. With proper _care_ a\r\npoorly developed body may be improved and do effective work.\r\n\r\nEugenics.--When people marry there are certain things that the individual\r\nas well as the race should demand. The most important of these is freedom\r\nfrom germ diseases which might be handed down to the offspring.\r\nTuberculosis, syphilis, that dread disease which cripples and kills\r\nhundreds of thousands of innocent children, epilepsy, and feeble-mindedness\r\nare handicaps which it is not only unfair but criminal to hand down to\r\nposterity. The science of being well born is called _eugenics_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In this and the following diagrams the circle represents a\r\nfemale, the square a male. N means normal; F means feeble-minded; A,\r\nalcoholic; T, tubercular; _Sx_, sexually immoral; _Sy_, having syphilis.\r\nThis chart shows the record of a certain family for three generations. A\r\nnormal woman married an alcoholic and tubercular man. He must have been\r\nfeeble-minded also as two of his children were born feeble-minded. One of\r\nthese children married another feeble-minded woman, and of their five\r\nchildren two died in infancy and three were feeble-minded. (After\r\nDavenport.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This chart shows that feeble-mindedness is a characteristic\r\nsure to be handed down in a family where it exists. The feeble-minded woman\r\nat the top left of the chart married twice. The first children from a\r\nnormal father are all normal, but the other children from an alcoholic\r\nfather are all feeble-minded. The right-hand side of the chart shows a\r\nterrible record of feeble-mindedness. Should feeble-minded people be\r\nallowed to marry? (After Davenport.)]\r\n\r\nThe Jukes.--Studies have been made on a number of different families in\r\nthis country, in which mental and moral defects were present in one or both\r\nof the original parents. The \"Jukes\" family is a notorious example. The\r\nfirst mother is known as \"Margaret, the mother of criminals.\" In\r\nseventy-five years the progeny of the original generation has cost the\r\nstate of New York over a million and a quarter of dollars, besides giving\r\nover to the care of prisons and asylums considerably over a hundred\r\nfeeble-minded, alcoholic, immoral, or criminal persons. Another case\r\nrecently studied is the \"Kallikak\" family.[35] This family has been traced\r\nback to the War of the Revolution, when a young soldier named Martin\r\nKallikak seduced a feeble-minded girl. She had a feeble-minded son from\r\nwhom there have been to the present time 480 descendants. Of these 33 were\r\nsexually immoral, 24 confirmed drunkards, 3 epileptics, and 143\r\n_feeble-minded_. The man who started this terrible line of immorality and\r\nfeeble-mindedness later married a normal Quaker girl. From this couple a\r\nline of 496 descendants have come, with _no_ cases of feeble-mindedness.\r\nThe evidence and the moral speak for themselves!\r\n\r\n     Footnote 35: The name Kallikak is fictitious.\r\n\r\nParasitism and its Cost to Society.--Hundreds of families\r\nsuch as those described above exist to-day, spreading disease,\r\nimmorality, and crime to all parts of this country. The cost to\r\nsociety of such families is very severe. Just as certain animals\r\nor plants become parasitic on other plants or animals, these families\r\nhave become parasitic on society. They not only do harm to others\r\nby corrupting, stealing, or spreading disease, but they are actually\r\nprotected and cared for by the state out of public money. Largely\r\nfor them the poorhouse and the asylum exist. They take from\r\nsociety, but they give nothing in return. They are true parasites.\r\n\r\nThe Remedy.--If such people were lower animals, we would\r\nprobably kill them off to prevent them from spreading. Humanity\r\nwill not allow this, but we do have the remedy of separating the\r\nsexes in asylums or other places and in various ways preventing\r\nintermarriage and the possibilities of perpetuating such a low and\r\ndegenerate race. Remedies of this sort have been tried successfully\r\nin Europe and are now meeting with success in this country.\r\n\r\nBlood Tells.--Eugenics show us, on the other hand, in a study\r\nof the families in which are brilliant men and women, the fact that\r\nthe descendants have received the _good_ inheritance from their\r\nancestors. The following, taken from Davenport's _Heredity in\r\nRelation to Eugenics_, illustrates how one family has been famous\r\nin American History.\r\n\r\nIn 1667 Elizabeth Tuttle, \"of strong will, and of extreme intellectual\r\nvigor, married Richard Edwards of Hartford, Conn., a man of high repute and\r\ngreat erudition. From their one son descended another son, Jonathan\r\nEdwards, a noted divine, and president of Princeton College. Of the\r\ndescendants of Jonathan Edwards much has been written; a brief catalogue\r\nmust suffice: Jonathan Edwards, Jr., president of Union College; Timothy\r\nDwight, president of Yale; Sereno Edwards Dwight, president of Hamilton\r\nCollege; Theodore Dwight Woolsey, for twenty-five years president of Yale\r\nCollege; Sarah, wife of Tapping Reeve, founder of Litchfield Law School,\r\nherself no mean lawyer; Daniel Tyler, a general in the Civil War and\r\nfounder of the iron industries of North Alabama; Timothy Dwight, second,\r\npresident of Yale University from 1886 to 1898; Theodore William Dwight,\r\nfounder and for thirty-three years warden of Columbia Law School; Henrietta\r\nFrances, wife of Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, who, burning the\r\nmidnight oil by the side of her ingenious husband, helped him to his\r\nenduring fame; Merrill Edwards Gates, president of Amherst College;\r\nCatherine Maria Sedgwick of graceful pen; Charles Sedgwick Minot, authority\r\non biology and embryology in the Harvard Medical School; Edith Kermit\r\nCarow, wife of Theodore Roosevelt; and Winston Churchill, the author of\r\n_Coniston_ and other well-known novels.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This record shows the inheritance of artistic ability (black\r\ncircles and squares). (After Davenport.)]\r\n\r\nOf the daughters of Elizabeth Tuttle distinguished descendants also came.\r\nRobert Treat Paine, signer of the Declaration of Independence; Chief\r\nJustice of the United States Morrison R. Waite; Ulysses S. Grant and Grover\r\nCleveland, presidents of the United States. These and many other prominent\r\nmen and women can trace the characters which enabled them to occupy the\r\npositions of culture and learning they held back to Elizabeth Tuttle.\r\n\r\nEuthenics.--Euthenics, the betterment of the environment, is another\r\nimportant factor in the production of a stronger race. The strongest\r\nphysical characteristics may be ruined if the surroundings are unwholesome\r\nand unsanitary. The slums of a city are \"at once symptom, effect, and cause\r\nof evil.\" A city which allows foul tenements, narrow streets, and crowded\r\nslums to exist will spend too much for police protection, for charity, and\r\nfor hospitals.\r\n\r\nEvery improvement in surroundings means improvement of the chances of\r\nsurvival of the race. In the spring of 1913 the health department and\r\nstreet-cleaning department of the city of New York cooperated to bring\r\nabout a \"clean up\" of all filth, dirt, and rubbish from the houses,\r\nstreets, and vacant lots in that city. During the summer of 1913 the health\r\ndepartment reported a smaller percentage of deaths of babies than ever\r\nbefore. We must draw our own conclusions. Clean streets and houses, clean\r\nmilk and pure water, sanitary housing, and careful medical inspection all\r\ndo their part in maintaining a low rate of illness and death, thus reacting\r\nupon the health of the citizens of the future. It will be the purpose of\r\nthe following pages to show how we may best care for our own bodies and how\r\nwe may better the environment in which we are placed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

THE HUMAN MACHINE AND ITS NEEDS\r\n\r\n_Problem.--To obtain a general understanding of the parts and uses of the\r\nbodily machine._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Demonstration._--Review to show that the human body is a\r\n       complex of cells.\r\n     _Laboratory demonstration_ by means of (_a_) human skeleton\r\n       and (_b_) manikin to show the position and gross structure\r\n       of the chief organs of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan and his Environment.--In the last chapter we saw that one factor in the\r\nimprovement of man lies in giving him better surroundings. It will be the\r\npurpose of the following chapters to show how man is fitted to live in the\r\nenvironment in which he is placed. He comes in contact with air, light,\r\nwater, soil, food, and shelter which make his somewhat artificial\r\nenvironment; he must adapt himself to get the best he can out of this\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nThe Needs of Living Things.--We have already found that the primary needs\r\nof plants and animals are the same. They both need food, they both need to\r\ndigest their food and to have it circulate in a fluid form to the cells\r\nwhere it will be used. They both need oxygen so as to release the energy\r\nlocked up in their food. And they both need to reproduce so that their kind\r\nmay be continued on the earth. What is true of plants and other animals is\r\ntrue of man.\r\n\r\nThe Needs of Simple and Complex Animals the Same.--The simplest animal, a\r\nsingle cell, has the same needs as the most complex. The _cell_ paramoecium\r\nfeeds, digests, oxidizes its food, and releases energy. The _cells_ of the\r\nhuman body built up into tissues have the same needs and perform the same\r\nfunctions as the paramoecium. It is the _cells_ of the body working\r\ntogether in groups as tissues and organs that make the complicated actions\r\nof man possible. Division of labor has arisen because of the complex needs\r\nand work of the organism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The human body seen from the side in longitudinal section.]\r\n\r\nThe Human Body a Machine.--In all animals, and the human animal is no\r\nexception, the body has been likened to a machine in that it turns over the\r\n_latent_ or potential energy stored up in food into _kinetic_ energy\r\n(mechanical work and heat), which is manifested when we perform work. One\r\ngreat difference exists between an engine and the human body. The engine\r\nuses fuel unlike the substance out of which it is made. The human body, on\r\nthe other hand, uses for fuel the same substances out of which it is\r\nformed; it may, indeed, use part of its own substance for food. It must as\r\nwell do more than purely mechanical work. The human organism must be so\r\ndelicately adjusted to its surroundings that it will react in a ready\r\nmanner to stimuli from without; it must be able to utilize its fuel (food)\r\nin the most economical manner; it must be fitted with machinery for\r\ntransforming the energy received from food into various kinds of work; it\r\nmust properly provide the machine with oxygen so that the fuel will be\r\noxidized, and the products of oxidation must be carried away, as well as\r\nother waste materials which might harm the effectiveness of the machine.\r\nMost important of all, the human machine must be able to repair itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand better this complicated machine, the human body, let\r\nus briefly examine the structure of its parts and thus get a better idea of\r\nthe interrelation of these parts and of their functions.\r\n\r\nThe Skin.--Covering the body is a protective structure called the skin.\r\nCovered on the outside with dead cells, yet it is provided with delicate\r\nsense organs, which give us perception of touch, taste, smell, pressure,\r\nand temperature. It also aids in getting wastes out of the body by means of\r\nits sweat glands and plays an important part in equalizing the temperature\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Skeleton of a man. _CR._, cranium; _CL._, clavicle; _ST._,\r\nsternum; _H._, humerus; _V.C._, vertebral column; _R._, radius; _U._, ulna;\r\n_P._, pelvic girdle; _C._, carpals; _M._, metacarpals; _Ph._, phalanges;\r\n_F._, femur; _Fi._, fibula; _T._, tibia; _Tar._, tarsals; _MT._,\r\nmetatarsals.]\r\n\r\nBones and Muscles.--The body is built around a framework of bones. These\r\nbones, which are bound together by tough _ligaments_, fall naturally into\r\ntwo great groups, the bones of the body proper, vertebral column, ribs,\r\nbreast bone, and skull, which form the _axial_ skeleton, and the\r\nappendages, two sets of bones which form the framework of the arms and\r\nlegs, which with the bones which attach them to the axial skeleton form the\r\n_appendicular_ skeleton.\r\n\r\nTo the bones are attached the muscles of the body. Movement is accomplished\r\nby contraction of muscles, which are attached so as to cause the bones to\r\nact as levers. Bones also protect the nervous system and other delicate\r\norgans. They also help to give form and rigidity to the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing action of biceps muscle. _a_, contracted;\r\n_b_, extended; _h_, humerus; _s_, scapula.]\r\n\r\nHygiene of Muscles and Bones.--Young people especially need to know how to\r\nprevent certain defects which are largely the result of bad habits of\r\nposture. Standing erect is an example of a good habit, round shoulders a\r\nbad habit of this sort. The habit of a wrong position of bones and muscles\r\nonce formed is very hard to correct. This can best be done by certain\r\ncorrective exercises at home or in the gymnasium.\r\n\r\nRound shoulders is most common among people whose occupation causes them to\r\nstoop. Drawing, writing, and a wrong position when at one's desk are among\r\nthe causes. Exercises which strengthen the back muscles and cause the head\r\nto be kept erect are helpful in forming the habit of erect carriage.\r\n\r\nSlight curvature of the spine either backward or forward is helped most by\r\nexercises which tend to straighten the body, such as stretching up with the\r\nhands above the head. Lateral curvature of the spine, too often caused by a\r\n\"hunched-up\" position at the school desk, may also be corrected by\r\nexercises which tend to lengthen the spinal column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three classes of levers in the human body; bones and muscles\r\nact together. _A_, a lever of the first class; _B_, a lever of the second\r\nclass; _C_, a lever of the third class.]\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every girl and boy to have good posture and erect\r\ncarriage, not only because of the better state of health which comes with\r\nit, but also because one's self-respect demands that each one of us makes\r\nthe best of the gifts that nature has given us. An erect head, straight\r\nshoulders, and elastic carriage go far toward making their owner both liked\r\nand respected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bad posture in the schoolroom may cause permanent injury to\r\nthe spine.]\r\n\r\nOther Body Structures.--In spaces between the muscles are found various\r\nother structures,--blood vessels, which carry blood to and from the great\r\npumping station, the heart, and thence to all parts of the body; connective\r\ntissue, which holds groups of muscle or other cells together; fat cells,\r\nscattered in various parts of the body; various gland cells, which\r\nmanufacture enzymes; and the cells of the nervous system, which aid in\r\ndirecting the body parts.\r\n\r\nBody Cavity.--Within the body is a cavity, which in life is almost\r\ncompletely filled with various organs. A thin wall of muscle called the\r\n_diaphragm_ divides the body cavity into two unequal spaces. In the upper\r\nspace are found the _heart_ and _lungs_, in the lower, the digestive tract\r\nwith its glands, the _liver_, _kidneys_, and other structures (see page 267).\r\n\r\nDigestion, Absorption, and Excretion.--Running through the body is a food\r\ntube in which undigested food is placed and from which digested or liquid\r\nfood is absorbed into the blood so that the cells of the various organs\r\nwhich do the work may receive food. Emptying into this food tube are\r\nvarious groups of gland cells, which pour digestive fluids over the solid\r\nfoods, thus aiding in changing them to liquids. Solid wastes are passed out\r\nthrough the posterior end of the food tube, while liquid wastes are\r\nexcreted by means of glands called _kidneys_.\r\n\r\nWork done by Cells.--Food, prepared in the digestive tract, and oxygen from\r\nthe lungs are taken by the blood to the cells. Bathed in liquid food, the\r\ncells do their work; they promote the oxidization of food and the exchange\r\nof carbon dioxide for oxygen in the blood, while other wastes of the cells\r\nare given off, to pass eventually through the kidneys and out of the body.\r\n\r\nThe Nervous System.--The smooth working of the bodily machine is due to\r\nanother set of structures which direct the working of the parts so that\r\nthey will act in unison. This director is the nervous system. We have seen\r\nthat, in the simplest of animals, one cell performs the functions necessary\r\nto its existence. In the more complex animals, where groups of cells form\r\ntissues, each having a different function, a nervous system is developed.\r\n_The functions of the human nervous system are:_ (1) _the providing of man\r\nwith sensation, by means of which he gets in touch with the world about\r\nhim;_ (2) _the connecting of organs in different parts of the body so that\r\nthey act as a united and harmonious whole;_ (3) _the giving to the human\r\nbeing a will, a provision for thought._ Cooperation in word and deed is the\r\nend attained. We are all familiar with examples of the cooperation of\r\norgans. You see food; the thought comes that it is good to eat; you reach\r\nout, take it, raise it to the mouth; the jaws move in response to your\r\nwill; the food is chewed and swallowed. While digestion and absorption of\r\nthe food are taking place, the nervous system is still in control. The\r\nnervous system also regulates pumping of blood over the body, respiration,\r\nsecretion of glands, and, indeed, every bodily function. Man is the highest\r\nof all animals because of the extreme development of the nervous system.\r\nMan is the thinking animal, and as such is master of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REFERENCE READING FOR THIS AND SUCCEEDING CHAPTERS ON HUMAN BIOLOGY\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

FOODS AND DIETARIES\r\n\r\n_Problems.--A study of foods to determine:--_\r\n          _(a) Their nutritive value._\r\n          _(b) The relation of work, environment, age, sex, and\r\n            digestibility of foods to diet._\r\n          _(c) Their relative cheapness._\r\n          _(d) The daily Calorie requirement._\r\n          _(e) Food adulteration._\r\n          _(f) The relation of alcohol to the human system._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Laboratory exercise._--Composition of common foods. The\r\n       series of food charts supplied by the United States\r\n       Department of Agriculture makes an excellent basis for a\r\n       laboratory exercise to determine common foods rich in (_a_)\r\n       water, (_b_) starch, (_c_) sugar, (_d_) fats or oils, (_e_)\r\n       protein, (_f_) salts, (_g_) refuse.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Method of using bomb calorimeter.\r\n     _Laboratory and home exercise._--To determine the best\r\n       individual balanced dietary (using standard of Atwater,\r\n       Chittenden, or Voit) as determined by the use of the\r\n       100-Calorie portion.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Tests for some common adulterants.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Effect of alcohol on protein, _e.g._ white\r\n       of egg.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Alcohol in some patent medicines.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Patent medicines containing acetanilid.\r\n       Determination of acetanilid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy we Need Food.--A locomotive engine takes coal, water, oxygen, from its\r\nenvironment. A living plant or animal takes organic food, water, and oxygen\r\nfrom its environment. Both the living and nonliving machine do the same\r\nthing with this fuel or food. They oxidize it and release the energy in it.\r\nBut the living organism in addition may use the food to repair parts that\r\nhave broken down or even build new parts. _Thus food may be defined as\r\nsomething that releases energy or that forms material for the growth or\r\nrepair of the body of a plant or animal._ The millions of cells of which\r\nthe body is composed must be given material which will form more living\r\nmatter or material which can be oxidized to release energy when muscle\r\ncells move, or gland cells secrete, or brain cells think.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The composition of milk. Why is it considered a good food?]\r\n\r\nNutrients.--Certain nutrient materials form the basis of food of both\r\nplants and animals. These have been stated to be _proteins_ (such as lean\r\nmeat, eggs, the gluten of bread), _carbohydrates_ (starches, sugars, gums,\r\netc.), _fats_ and _oils_ (both animal and vegetable), _mineral matter_ and\r\n_water_.\r\n\r\nProteins.--Protein substances contain the element nitrogen. Hence such\r\nfoods are called nitrogenous foods. Man must form the protoplasm of his\r\nbody (that is, the muscles, tendons, nervous system, blood corpuscles, the\r\nliving parts of the bone and the skin, etc.) in part at least from\r\nnitrogenous food. Some of this he obtains by eating the flesh of animals,\r\nand some he obtains directly from plants (for example, peas and beans).\r\nProteins are the only foods available for tissue building. They may be\r\noxidized to release energy if occasion requires it.\r\n\r\nFats and Oils.--Fats and oils, both animal and vegetable, are the materials\r\nfrom which the body derives part of its energy. The chemical formula of a\r\nfat shows that, compared with other food substances, there is very little\r\noxygen present; hence the greater capacity of this substance for uniting\r\nwith oxygen. The rapid burning of fat compared with the slower combustion\r\nof a piece of meat or a piece of bread illustrates this. A pound of butter\r\nreleases over twice as much energy to the body as does a pound of sugar or\r\na pound of steak. Human fatty tissue is formed in part from fat eaten, but\r\ncarbohydrate or even protein food may be changed and stored in the body as\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates.--We see that the carbohydrates, like the fats, contain\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. _Carbohydrates are essentially\r\nenergy-producing foods._ They are, however, of use in building up or\r\nrepairing tissue. It is certainly true that in both plants and animals such\r\nfoods pass directly, together with foods containing nitrogen, to repair\r\nwaste in tissues, thus giving the needed proportion of carbon, oxygen, and\r\nhydrogen to unite with the nitrogen in forming the protoplasm of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three portions of foods, each of which furnishes about the\r\nsame amount of nourishment.]\r\n\r\nInorganic Foods.--Water forms a large part of almost every food substance.\r\nIt forms about five sixths of a normal daily diet. The human body, by\r\nweight, is about two thirds water. About 90 per cent of the blood is water.\r\nWater is absolutely essential in passing off waste of the body. When we\r\ndrink water, we take with it some of the inorganic salts used by the body\r\nin the making of bone and in the formation of protoplasm. Sodium chloride\r\n(table salt), an important part of the blood, is taken in as a flavoring\r\nupon our meats and vegetables. Phosphate of lime and potash are important\r\nfactors in the formation of bone.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus is a necessary substance for the making of living matter, milk,\r\neggs, meat, whole wheat, and dried peas and beans containing small amounts\r\nof it. Iron also is an extremely important mineral, for it is used in the\r\nbuilding of red blood cells. Meats, eggs, peas and beans, spinach, and\r\nprunes, are foods containing some iron.\r\n\r\nSome other salts, compounds of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and\r\nphosphorus, have been recently found to aid the body in many of its most\r\nimportant functions. The beating of the heart, the contraction of muscles,\r\nand the ability of the nerves to do their work appear to be due to the\r\npresence of minute quantities of these salts in the body.\r\n\r\nUses of Nutrients.--The following table sums up the uses of nutrients to\r\nman:[36]--\r\n\r\n  Protein                          Forms tissue        \\\r\n    White of eggs (albumen),         (muscles, tendon, }\r\n      curd of milk (casein), lean    and probably      } All serve as\r\n      meat, gluten of wheat, etc.    fat)              } _fuel_ and yield\r\n                                                       } _energy_ in form\r\n  Fats                              Form fatty tissue. } of heat and muscular\r\n    Fat of meat, butter, olive oil,                    } strength.\r\n      oils of corn and wheat, etc.                     }\r\n                                                       }\r\n  Carbohydrates                     Transformed into   }\r\n    Sugar, starch, etc.               fat.             /\r\n\r\n  Mineral matters (ash)             Aid in forming bone,\r\n    Phosphates of lime, potash,       assist in digestion,\r\n      soda, etc.                      aid in absorption\r\n                                      and in other ways\r\n                                      help the body parts\r\n                                      do their work.\r\n  Water used as a vehicle to carry nutrients, and enters into the\r\n  composition of living matter.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 36: Adapted from Atwater, _Principles of Nutrition\r\n     and Nutritive Value of Food_, U. S. Department of\r\n     Agriculture, 1902.\r\n\r\nCommon Foods contain the Nutrients.--We have already found in our plant\r\nstudy that various plant foods are rich in different nutrients,\r\ncarbohydrates forming the chief nutrient in the foods we call cereals,\r\nbreads, cake, fleshy fruits, sugars, jellies, and the like. Fats and oils\r\nare most largely found in nuts and some grains. Animal foods are our chief\r\nsupply of protein. White of egg and lean meat are almost pure protein and\r\nwater. Proteins are most abundant, as we should expect, in those plants\r\nwhich are richly supplied with nitrogen; peas and beans, and in grains and\r\nnuts. Fats, which are melted into oils at the temperature of the body, are\r\nrepresented by the fat in meats, bacon, pork, lard, butter, and vegetable\r\noils.\r\n\r\nWater.--Water is, as we have seen, a valuable part of food. It makes up a\r\nvery high percentage of fresh fruits and vegetables; it is also present in\r\nmilk and eggs, less abundant in meats and fish, and is lowest in dried\r\nfoods and nuts. The amount of water in a given food is often a decided\r\nfactor in the cost of the given food, as can easily be seen by reference to\r\nthe chart on page 283.\r\n\r\nRefuse.--Some foods bought in the market may contain a certain unusable\r\nportion. This we call refuse. Examples of refuse are bones in meat, shells\r\nof eggs or of shellfish, the covering of plant cells which form the skins\r\nof potatoes or other vegetables. The amount of refuse present also plays an\r\nimportant part in the values of foods for the table. The table[37] on page\r\n276 gives the percentages of organic nutrients, water, and refuse present\r\nin some common foods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table of food values. Determine the percentage of water in\r\ncodfish, loin of beef, milk, potatoes. Percentage of refuse in leg of\r\nmutton, codfish, eggs, and potatoes. What _is_ the refuse in each case?\r\nFind three foods containing a high percentage of protein; of fat; of\r\ncarbohydrate. Find some food in which the proportions of protein, fat, and\r\ncarbohydrate are combined in a good proportion.]\r\n\r\nFuel Values of Nutrients.--In experiments performed by Professor Atwater\r\nand others, and in the appended tables, the value of food as a source of\r\nenergy is stated in heat units called _Calories_. _A Calorie is the amount\r\nof heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water from\r\nzero to one degree Centigrade._ This is about equivalent to raising one\r\npound four degrees Fahrenheit. The fuel value of different foods may be\r\ncomputed in a definite manner. This is done by burning a given portion of a\r\nfood (say one gram) in the apparatus known as a _calorimeter_. By this\r\nmeans may be determined the number of degrees the temperature of a given\r\namount of water is raised during the process of burning. It has thus been\r\nfound that a gram of fat will liberate 9.3 Calories of heat, while a gram\r\nof starch or sugar only about 4 Calories. The burning value of fat is,\r\ntherefore, over twice that of carbohydrates. In a similar manner protein\r\nhas been shown to have about the same fuel value as carbohydrates, _i.e._ 4\r\nCalories to a gram.[38]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 37 and 38: W. O. Atwater, _Principles of Nutrition\r\n     and Nutritive Value of Food_, U. S. Department of\r\n     Agriculture, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Work to Diet.--It has been shown experimentally that a man\r\ndoing hard, muscular work needs more food than a person doing light work.\r\nThe mere exercise gives the individual a hearty appetite; he eats more and\r\nneeds more of all kinds of food than a man or boy doing light work.\r\nEspecially is it true that the person of sedentary habits, who does brain\r\nwork, should be careful to eat less food and food that will digest easily.\r\nHis protein food should also be reduced. Rich or hearty foods may be left\r\nfor the man who is doing hard manual labor out of doors, for any extra work\r\nput on the digestive organs takes away just so much from the ability of the\r\nbrain to do its work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Foods of plant origin. Select 5 foods containing a high\r\npercentage of protein, 5 with a high percentage of carbohydrates, 5 with a\r\nhigh percentage of water. Do vegetable foods contain much fat? Which of the\r\nabove-mentioned foods have the highest burning value?]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Foods largely of animal origin. Compare with the previous\r\nchart with reference to amount of protein, carbohydrate, and fat in foods.\r\nCompare the burning value of plant and animal foods. Compare the relative\r\npercentage of water in both kinds of foods.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The composition of milk.]\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Environment to Diet.--We are all aware of the fact that the\r\nbody seems to crave more food in winter than in summer. The temperature of\r\nthe body is maintained at 98.6 deg. in winter as in summer, but much more heat\r\nis lost from the body in cold weather. Hence feeding in winter should be\r\nfor the purpose of maintaining our fuel supply. We need heat-producing\r\nfood, and we need _more_ food in winter than in summer. We may use\r\ncarbohydrates for this purpose, as they are economical and digestible. The\r\ninhabitants of cold countries get their heat-releasing foods largely from\r\nfats. In tropical countries and in hot weather little protein should be\r\neaten and a considerable amount of fresh fruit used.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Age to Diet.--As we will see a little later, age is a\r\nfactor not only in determining the kind but the amount of food to be used.\r\nYoung children require far less food than do those of older growth or\r\nadults. The body constantly increases in weight until young manhood, or\r\nwomanhood, then its weight remains nearly stationary, varying with health\r\nor illness. It is evident that food in adults simply repairs the waste of\r\ncells and is used to supply energy. Elderly people need much less protein\r\nthan do younger persons. But inasmuch as the amount of food to be taken\r\ninto the body should be in proportion to the body weight, it is also\r\nevident that growing children do not, as is popularly supposed, need as\r\nmuch food as grown-ups.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Sex to Diet.--As a rule boys need more food than girls, and\r\nmen than women. This seems to be due to, first, the more active muscular\r\nlife of the man and, secondly, to the greater amount of fat in the tissues\r\nof the woman, making loss of heat less. Larger bodies, because of greater\r\nsurface, give off more heat than smaller ones. Men are usually larger in\r\nbulk than are women,--another reason for more food in their case.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Digestibility to Diet.--Animal foods in general may be said\r\nto be more completely digested within the body than plant foods. This is\r\nlargely due to the fact that plant cells have woody walls that the\r\ndigestive juices cannot act upon. Cereals and legumes are less digestible\r\nfoods than are dairy products, meat, or fish. This does not mean\r\nnecessarily that these foods would not agree with you or me but that in\r\ngeneral the body would get less nourishment out of the total amount\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe agreement or disagreement of food with an individual is largely a\r\npersonal matter. I, for example, cannot eat raw tomatoes without suffering\r\nfrom indigestion, while some one else can digest tomatoes but not\r\nstrawberries. Each individual should learn early in life the foods that\r\ndisagree with him personally and leave such foods out of his dietary. For\r\n\"what is one man's meat may be another man's poison.\"\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Cost of Food to Diet.--It is a mistaken notion that the\r\nbest foods are always the most expensive. A glance at the table (page 283)\r\nwill show us that both fuel value and tissue-building value is present in\r\nsome foods from vegetable sources, as well as in those from animal sources,\r\nand that the vegetable foods are much cheaper. The American people are far\r\nless economical in their purchase of food than most other nations. Nearly\r\none half of the total income of the average workingman is spent on food.\r\nNot only does he spend a large amount on food, but he wastes money in\r\npurchasing the wrong kinds of food. A comparison of the daily diets of\r\npersons in various occupations in this and other countries shows that as a\r\nrule we eat more than is necessary to supply the necessary fuel and repair,\r\nand that our workingmen eat more than those of other countries. Another\r\nwaste of money by the American is in the false notion that a large\r\nproportion of the daily dietary should be meat. Many people think that the\r\nmost expensive cuts of meat are the most nutritious. The falsity of this\r\nidea may be seen by a careful study of the tables on pages 283 and 286.\r\n\r\nThe Best Dietary.--Inasmuch as all living substance contains nitrogen, it\r\nis evident that protein food must form a part of the dietary; but protein\r\nalone is not usable. If more protein is eaten than the body requires, then\r\nimmediately the liver and kidneys have to work overtime to get rid of the\r\nexcess of protein which forms a poisonous waste harmful to the body. We\r\nmust take foods that will give us, as nearly as possible, the proportion of\r\nthe different chemical elements as they are contained in protoplasm. It has\r\nbeen found, as a result of studies of Atwater and others, that a man who\r\ndoes muscular work requires a little less than one quarter of a pound of\r\nprotein, the same amount of fat, and about one pound of carbohydrate to\r\nprovide for the growth, waste, and repair of the body and the energy used\r\nup in one day.\r\n\r\nThe Daily Calorie Requirement.--Put in another way, Atwater's standard for\r\na man at light exercise is food enough to yield 2816 Calories; of these,\r\n410 Calories are from protein, 930 Calories from fat, and 1476 Calories\r\nfrom carbohydrate. That is, for every 100 Calories furnished by the food,\r\n14 are from protein, 32 from fat, and 54 from carbohydrate. In exact\r\nnumbers, the day's ration as advocated by Atwater would contain about 100\r\ngrams or 3.7 ounces protein, 100 grams or 3.7 ounces fat, and 360 grams or\r\n13 ounces carbohydrate. Professor Chittenden of Yale University, another\r\nfood expert, thinks we need proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in about the\r\nproportion of 1 to 3 to 6, thus differing from Atwater in giving less\r\nprotein in proportion. Chittenden's standard for the same man is food to\r\nyield a total of 2360 Calories, of which protein furnishes 236 Calories,\r\nfat 708 Calories, and carbohydrates 1416 Calories. For every 100 Calories\r\nfurnished by the food, 10 are from protein, 30 from fat, 60 from\r\ncarbohydrate. In actual amount the Chittenden diet would contain 2.16\r\nounces protein, 2.83 ounces fat, and 13 ounces carbohydrate. A German named\r\nVoit gives as ideal 25 Calories from proteins, 20 from fat, and 55 from\r\ncarbohydrate, out of every 100 Calories; this is nearer our actual daily\r\nration. In addition, an ounce of salt and nearly one hundred ounces of\r\nwater are used in a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table showing the cost of various foods. Using this table,\r\nmake up an economical dietary for one day, three meals, for a man doing\r\nmoderate work. Give reasons for the amount of food used and for your choice\r\nof foods. Make up another dietary in the same manner, using expensive\r\nfoods. What is the difference in your bill for the day?]\r\n\r\nA Mixed Diet Best.--Knowing the proportion of the different food substances\r\nrequired by man, it will be an easy matter to determine from the tables and\r\ncharts shown you the best foods for use in a mixed diet. Meats contain too\r\nmuch nitrogen in proportion to the other substances. In milk, the\r\nproportion of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats is nearly right to make\r\nprotoplasm; a considerable amount of mineral matter being also present. For\r\nthese reasons, milk is extensively used as a food for children, as it\r\ncombines food material for the forming of protoplasm with mineral matter\r\nfor the building of bone. Some vegetables (for example, peas and beans)\r\ncontain a large amount of nitrogenous material but in a less digestible\r\nform than is found in some other foods. Vegetarians, then, are correct in\r\ntheory when they state that a diet of vegetables may contain everything\r\nnecessary to sustain life. But a mixed diet containing meat is healthier. A\r\npurely vegetable diet contains much waste material, such as the cellulose\r\nforming the walls of plant cells, which is indigestible. It has been\r\nrecently discovered that the outer coats of some grains, as rice, contain\r\ncertain substances (enzymes) which aid in digestion. In the case of\r\npolished rice, when this outer coat is removed the grain has much less food\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nDaily Fuel Needs of the Body.--It has been pointed out that the daily diet\r\nshould differ widely according to age, occupation, time of year, etc. The\r\nfollowing table shows the daily fuel needs for several ages and\r\noccupations:--\r\n\r\n          DAILY CALORIE NEEDS (APPROXIMATELY)\r\n\r\n   1. For child under 2 years                          900 Calories\r\n   2. For child from 2-5 years                        1200 Calories\r\n   3. For child from 6-9 years                        1500 Calories\r\n   4. For child from 10-12 years                      1800 Calories\r\n   5. For child from 12-14 (woman, light work, also)  2100 Calories\r\n   6. For boy (12-14), girl (15-16), man, sedentary   2400 Calories\r\n   7. For boy (15-16) (man, light muscular work)      2700 Calories\r\n   8. For man, moderately active muscular work        3000 Calories\r\n   9. For farmer (busy season)                3200 to 4000 Calories\r\n  10. For ditchers, excavators, etc.          4000 to 5000 Calories\r\n  11. For lumbermen, etc.                    5000 and more Calories\r\n\r\nNormal Heat Output.--The following table gives the result of some\r\nexperiments made to determine the hourly and daily expenditure of energy of\r\nthe average normal grown person when asleep and awake, at work or at\r\nrest:--\r\n\r\n        AVERAGE NORMAL OUTPUT OF HEAT FROM THE BODY\r\n  ==========================================================\r\n                                             |   AVERAGE\r\n      CONDITIONS OF MUSCULAR ACTIVITY        |   CALORIES\r\n                                             |   PER HOUR\r\n  -------------------------------------------+--------------\r\n  Man at rest, sleeping                      |  65 Calories\r\n  Man at rest, awake, sitting up             | 100 Calories\r\n  Man at light muscular exercise             | 170 Calories\r\n  Man at moderately active muscular exercise | 290 Calories\r\n  Man at severe muscular exercise            | 450 Calories\r\n  Man at very severe muscular exercise       | 600 Calories\r\n  ==========================================================\r\n\r\nIt is very simple to use such a table in calculating the number of Calories\r\nwhich are spent in twenty-four hours under different bodily conditions. For\r\nexample, suppose the case of a clerk or school teacher leading a relatively\r\ninactive life, who\r\n\r\n  sleeps for 9 hours                   x  65 Calories = 585\r\n  works at desk 9 hours                x 100 Calories = 900\r\n  reads, writes, or studies 4 hours    x 100 Calories = 400\r\n  walks or does light exercise 2 hours x 170 Calories = 340\r\n                                                       ----\r\n                                                       2225\r\n\r\nThis comes out, as we see, very close to example 6 of the table[39] on page\r\n284.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 39: The above tables have been taken from the\r\n     excellent pamphlet of the Cornell Reading Course, No. 6,\r\n     _Human Nutrition_.\r\n\r\nHow we may Find whether we are Eating a properly Balanced Diet.--We already\r\nknow approximately our daily Calorie needs and about the proportion of\r\nprotein, fat, and carbohydrate needed. Dr. Irving Fisher of Yale University\r\nhas worked out a very easy method of determining whether one is living on a\r\nproper diet. He has made up a number of tables, in which he has designated\r\nportions of food, each of which furnishes 100 Calories of energy. The\r\ntables show the proportion of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in each food,\r\nso that it is a simple matter by using such a table to estimate the\r\nproportions of the various nutrients in our dietary. We may depend upon\r\ntaking somewhere near the proper amount of food if we take a diet based\r\nupon either Atwater's, Chittenden's, or Voit's standard. One of the most\r\ninteresting and useful pieces of home work that you can do is to estimate\r\nyour own personal dietary, using the tables giving the 100-Calorie portion\r\nto see if you have a properly balanced diet.

Make a second dietary\r\nfor the same time and same number of people which shall give approximately\r\nthe same amount of tissue and energy producing food from more expensive\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nFood Waste in the Kitchen.--Much loss occurs in the improper cooking of\r\nfoods. Meats especially, when overdone, lose much of their flavor and are\r\nfar less easily digested than when they are cooked rare. The chief reasons\r\nfor cooking meats are that the muscle fibers may be loosened and softened,\r\nand that the bacteria or other parasites in the meat may be killed by the\r\nheat. The common method of frying makes foods less digestible. Stewing is\r\nan economical as well as healthful method. A good way to prepare meat,\r\neither for stew or soup, is to place the meat, cut in small pieces, in cold\r\nwater, and allow it to simmer for several hours. Rapid boiling toughens the\r\nmuscle fibers by the too rapid coagulation of the albuminous matter in\r\nthem, just as the white of egg becomes tough when boiled too long. Boiling\r\nand roasting are excellent methods of cooking meat. In order to prevent the\r\nloss of the nutrients in roasting, it is well to baste the meat frequently;\r\nthus a crust is formed on the outer surface of the meat, which prevents the\r\nescape of the juices from the inside.\r\n\r\nVegetables are cooked in order that the cells containing starch grains may\r\nbe burst open, thus allowing the starch to be more easily attacked by the\r\ndigestive fluids. Inasmuch as water may dissolve out nutrients from\r\nvegetable tissues, it is best to boil them rapidly in a small amount of\r\nwater. This gives less time for the solvent action to take place.\r\nVegetables should be cooked with the outer skin left on when it is\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAdulterations in Foods.--The addition of some cheaper substance to a food,\r\nor the subtraction of some valuable substance from a food, with the view to\r\ncheating the purchaser, is known as _adulteration_. Many foods which are\r\nartificially manufactured have been adulterated to such an extent as to be\r\nalmost unfit for food, or even harmful. One of the commonest adulterations\r\nis the substitution of grape sugar (glucose) for cane sugar. Glucose,\r\nhowever, is not a harmful adulterant. It is used largely in candy making.\r\nFlour and other cereal foods are sometimes adulterated with some cheap\r\nsubstitutes, as bran or sawdust. Alum is sometimes added to make flour\r\nwhiter. Probably the food which suffers most from adulteration is milk, as\r\nwater can be added without the average person being the wiser. By means of\r\nan inexpensive instrument known as a _lactometer_, this cheat may easily be\r\ndetected. In most cities, the milk supply is carefully safeguarded, because\r\nof the danger of spreading typhoid fever from impure milk (see Chapter\r\nXX). Before the pure food law was passed in 1906, milk was\r\nfrequently adulterated with substances like formalin to make it keep sweet\r\nlonger. Such preservatives are harmful, and it is now against the law to\r\nadd anything whatever to milk.\r\n\r\nCoffee, cocoa, and spices are subject to great adulteration; cottonseed oil\r\nis often substituted for olive oil; butter is too frequently artificial;\r\nwhile honey, sirups of various kinds, cider and vinegar, have all been\r\nfound to be either artificially made from cheaper substitutes or to contain\r\nsuch substitutes.\r\n\r\nPure Food Laws.--Thanks to the National Pure Food and Drug Law passed by\r\nCongress in 1906, and to the activity of various city and state boards of\r\nhealth, the opportunity to pass adulterated foods on the public is greatly\r\nlessened. This law compels manufacturers of foods or medicines to state the\r\ncomposition of their products on the labels placed on the jars or bottles.\r\nSo if a person reads the label he can determine exactly what he is getting\r\nfor his money.\r\n\r\nImpure Water.--Great danger comes from drinking impure water. This subject\r\nhas already been discussed under Bacteria, where it was seen that the\r\nspread of typhoid fever in particular is due to a contaminated water\r\nsupply. As citizens, we must aid all legislation that will safeguard the\r\nwater used by our towns and cities. Boiling water for ten minutes or longer\r\nwill render it safe from all organic impurities.\r\n\r\nStimulants.--We have learned that food is anything that supplies building\r\nmaterial or releases energy in the body; but some materials used by man,\r\npresumably as food, do not come under this head. Such are tea and coffee.\r\nWhen taken in moderate quantities, _they produce a temporary increase in\r\nthe vital activities_ of the person taking them. This is said to be a\r\nstimulation; and material taken into the digestive tract, producing this,\r\nis called a _stimulant_. In moderation, tea and coffee appear to be\r\nharmless. Some people, however, cannot use either without ill effects, even\r\nin small quantity. It is the _habit_ formed of relying upon the stimulus\r\ngiven by tea or coffee that makes them a danger to man. Cocoa and\r\nchocolate, although both contain a stimulant, are in addition good foods,\r\nhaving from 12 per cent to 21 per cent of protein, from 29 per cent to 48\r\nper cent fat, and over 30 per cent carbohydrate in their composition.\r\n\r\nIs Alcohol a Food?--The question of the use of alcohol has been of late\r\nyears a matter of absorbing interest and importance among physiologists. A\r\nfew years ago Dr. Atwater performed a series of very careful experiments by\r\nmeans of the respiration calorimeter, to ascertain whether alcohol is of\r\nuse to the body as food.[40] In these experiments the subjects were given,\r\ninstead of their daily allotment of carbohydrates and fats, enough alcohol\r\nto supply the same amount of energy that these foods would have given. The\r\namount was calculated to be about two and one half ounces per day, about as\r\nmuch as would be contained in a bottle of light wine.[41] This alcohol was\r\nadministered in small doses six times during the day. Professor Atwater's\r\nresults may be summed up briefly as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The alcohol administered was almost all oxidized in the body.\r\n\r\n2. The potential energy in the alcohol was transformed into heat or\r\nmuscular work.\r\n\r\n3. The body did about as well with the rations including alcohol as it did\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 40: Alcohol is made up of carbon, oxygen, and\r\n     hydrogen. It is very easily oxidized, but it cannot, as is\r\n     shown by the chemical formula, be of use to the body in\r\n     tissue building, because of its lack of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 41: Alcoholic beverages contain the following\r\n     proportions of alcohol: beer, from 2 to 5 per cent; wine,\r\n     from 10 to 20 per cent; liquors, from 30 to 70 per cent.\r\n     Patent medicines frequently contain as high as 60 per cent\r\n     alcohol. (See page 294.)\r\n\r\nThe committee of fifty eminent men appointed to report on the physiological\r\naspects of the drink problem reported that a large number of scientific men\r\nstate that they are in the habit of taking alcoholic liquor in small\r\nquantities, and many report that they do not _feel_ harm thereby. A number\r\nof scientists seem to agree that within limits alcohol may be a kind of\r\nfood, although a very _poor_ food.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we know that although alcohol may technically be\r\nconsidered as a food, it is a very unsatisfactory food and, as the\r\nfollowing statements show, it has an effect on the body tissues which foods\r\ndo not have.\r\n\r\nProfessor Chittenden of Yale College, in discussing the food problem of\r\nalcohol, writes as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"It is true that alcohol in moderate quantities may serve as a food,\r\n     _i.e._ it can be oxidized with the liberation of heat. It may to some\r\n     extent take the place of fat and carbohydrates, but it is not a\r\n     perfect substitute for them, and for this reason alcohol has an action\r\n     that cannot be ignored. It reduces liver oxidation. It therefore\r\n     presents a dangerous side wholly wanting in carbohydrates and fat. The\r\n     latter are simply burned up to carbonic acid and water or are\r\n     transformed to glycogen and fat, but alcohol, although more easily\r\n     oxidized, is at all times liable to obstruct, in a measure at least,\r\n     the oxidative processes of the liver and probably of other tissues\r\n     also, thereby throwing into the circulation bodies, such as uric acid,\r\n     which are harmful to health, a fact which at once tends to draw a\r\n     distinct line of demarcation between alcohol and the two\r\n     non-nitrogenous foods, fat and carbohydrates. Another matter must be\r\n     emphasized, and it is that the form in which alcohol is taken is of\r\n     importance. Port wine, for instance, has more influence on the amount\r\n     of uric acid secreted than an equivalent amount of alcohol has in some\r\n     other form. To conclude: as an adjunct to the ordinary daily diet of\r\n     the healthy man alcohol cannot be considered as playing the part of a\r\n     true non-nitrogenous food.\"--Quoted in _American Journal of\r\n     Inebriety_, Winter, 1906.\r\n\r\nEffect of Alcohol on Living Matter.--If we examine raw white of egg, we\r\nfind a protein which closely resembles protoplasm in its chemical\r\ncomposition; it is called albumen. Add to a little albumen in a test tube\r\nsome 95 per cent alcohol and notice what happens. As soon as the alcohol\r\ntouches the albumen the latter coagulates and becomes hard like boiled\r\nwhite of egg. Shake the alcohol with the albumen and the entire mass soon\r\nbecomes a solid. This is because the alcohol draws the water out of the\r\nalbumen. It has been shown that albumen is somewhat like protoplasm in\r\nstructure and chemical composition. Strong alcohol acts in a similar manner\r\non living matter when it is absorbed by the living body cells. It draws\r\nwater from them and hardens them. It has a chemical and physical action\r\nupon living matter.\r\n\r\nAlcohol a Poison.--But alcohol is also in certain quantities a poison. _A\r\ncommonly accepted definition of a poison is that it is any substance which,\r\nwhen taken into the body, tends to cause serious detriment to health, or\r\nthe death of the organism._ That alcohol may do this is well known by\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that alcohol taken in small quantities\r\ndoes not do any _apparent_ harm. But if we examine the vital records of\r\nlife insurance companies, we find a large number of deaths directly due to\r\nalcohol and a still greater number due in part to its use. In the United\r\nStates every year there are a third more deaths from alcoholism and\r\ncirrhosis of the liver (a disease _directly_ caused by alcohol) than there\r\nare from typhoid fever. The poisonous effect is not found in small doses,\r\nbut it ultimately shows its harmful effect. Hardening of the arteries, an\r\nold-age disease, is rapidly becoming in this country a disease of the\r\nmiddle aged. From it there is no escape. It is chiefly caused by the\r\ncumulative effect of alcohol. The diagram following, compiled by two\r\nEnglish life insurance companies that insure moderate drinkers and\r\nabstainers, shows the death rate to be considerably higher among those who\r\nuse alcohol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abstainers live longer than moderate drinkers.]\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg, the founder of the famous Battle Creek Sanitarium, points out\r\nthat strychnine, quinine, and many other drugs are oxidized in the body but\r\nsurely cannot be called foods. The following reasons for not considering\r\nalcohol a food are taken from his writings:--\r\n\r\n     \"1. A habitual user of alcohol has an intense craving for\r\n     his accustomed dram. Without it he is entirely unfitted for\r\n     business. One never experiences such an insane craving for\r\n     bread, potatoes, or any other particular article of food.\r\n\r\n     \"2. By continuous use the body acquires a tolerance for\r\n     alcohol. That is, the amount which may be imbibed and the\r\n     amount required to produce the characteristic effects first\r\n     experienced gradually increase until very great quantities\r\n     are sometimes required to satisfy the craving which its\r\n     habitual use often produces. This is never the case with\r\n     true foods.... Alcohol behaves in this regard just as does\r\n     opium or any other drug. It has no resemblance to a food.\r\n\r\n     \"3. When alcohol is withdrawn from a person who has been\r\n     accustomed to its daily use, most distressing effects are\r\n     experienced.... Who ever saw a man's hand trembling or his\r\n     nervous system unstrung because he could not get a potato or\r\n     a piece of cornbread for breakfast? In this respect, also,\r\n     alcohol behaves like opium, cocaine, or any other enslaving\r\n     drug.\r\n\r\n     \"4. Alcohol lessens the appreciation and the value of brain\r\n     and nerve activity, while food reenforces nervous and mental\r\n     energy.\r\n\r\n     \"5. Alcohol as a protoplasmic poison lessens muscular power,\r\n     whereas food increases energy and endurance.\r\n\r\n     \"6. Alcohol lessens the power to endure cold. This is true\r\n     to such a marked degree that its use by persons accompanying\r\n     Arctic expeditions is absolutely prohibited. Food, on the\r\n     other hand, increases ability to endure cold. The\r\n     temperature after taking food is raised. After taking\r\n     alcohol, the temperature, as shown by the thermometer, is\r\n     lowered.\r\n\r\n     \"7. Alcohol cannot be stored in the body for future use,\r\n     whereas all food substances can be so stored.\r\n\r\n     \"8. Food burns slowly in the body, as it is required to\r\n     satisfy the body's needs. Alcohol is readily oxidized and\r\n     eliminated, the same as any other oxidizable drug.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment (by Davison) to show how the nicotine in six\r\ncigarettes was sufficient to kill this fish. The smoke from the cigarettes\r\nwas passed through the water in which the fish is swimming.]\r\n\r\nThe Use of Tobacco.--A well-known authority defines a narcotic as a\r\nsubstance \"_which directly induces sleep, blunts the senses, and, in large\r\namounts, produces complete insensibility_.\" Tobacco, opium, chloral, and\r\ncocaine are examples of narcotics. Tobacco owes its narcotic influence to a\r\nstrong poison known as nicotine. Its use in killing insect parasites on\r\nplants is well known. In experiments with jellyfish and other lowly\r\norganized animals, the author has found as small a per cent as one part of\r\nnicotine to one hundred thousand parts of sea water to be sufficient to\r\nprofoundly affect an animal placed within it. The illustration here given\r\nshows the effect of nicotine upon a fish, one of the vertebrate animals.\r\nNicotine in a pure form is so powerful a poison that two or three drops\r\nwould be sufficient to cause the death of a man by its action upon the\r\nnervous system, especially the nerves controlling the beating of the heart.\r\nThis action is well known among boys training for athletic contests. The\r\nheart is affected; boys become \"short-winded\" as a result of the action on\r\nthe heart. It has been demonstrated that tobacco has, too, an important\r\neffect on muscular development. The stunted appearance of the young smoker\r\nis well known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The amounts of alcohol in some liquors and in some patent\r\nmedicines. _a_, beer, 5 %; _b_, claret, 8 %; _c_, champagne, 9 %; _d_,\r\nwhisky, 50 %; _e_, well-known sarsaparilla, 18 %; _f_, _g_, _h_,\r\nmuch-advertised nerve tonics, 20 %, 21 %, 25 %; _i_, another\r\nmuch-advertised sarsaparilla, 27 %; _j_, a well-known tonic, 28 %; _k_,\r\n_l_, bitters, 37 %, 44 % alcohol.]\r\n\r\nUse and Abuse of Drugs.--The American people are addicted to the use of\r\ndrugs, and especially patent medicines. A glance at the street-car\r\nadvertisements shows this. Most of the medicines advertised contain alcohol\r\nin greater quantity than beer or wine, and many of them have opium,\r\nmorphine, or cocaine in their composition. Paregoric and laudanum,\r\nmedicines sometimes given to young children, are examples of dangerous\r\ndrugs that contain opium. Dr. George D. Haggard of Minneapolis has shown by\r\nmany analyses that a large number of the so-called \"malts,\" \"malt\r\nextracts,\" and \"tonics,\" including several of the best known and most\r\nadvertised on the market, are simply disguised beers and, frequently, very\r\npoor beers at that. These drugs, in addition to being harmful, affect the\r\nperson using them in such a manner that he soon feels the need for the\r\ndrug. Thus the drug habit is formed,--a condition which has wrecked\r\nthousands of lives. A number of articles on patent medicines recently\r\nappeared in a leading magazine and have been collected and published under\r\nthe title of _The Great American Fraud_. In this booklet the author points\r\nout a number of different kinds of \"cures\" and patent medicines. The most\r\ndangerous are those headache or neuralgia cures containing _acetanilid_.\r\nThis drug is a heart depresser and should not be used without medical\r\nadvice. Another drug which is responsible for habit formation is _cocaine_.\r\nThis is often found in catarrh or other cures. Alcohol is the basis of all\r\ntonics or \"bracers.\" Every boy and girl should read this booklet so as to\r\nbe forearmed against evils of the sort just described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  REFERENCE READING ON FOODS\r\n\r\n  Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology._ American Book\r\n    Company.\r\n  Allen, _Civics and Health._ Ginn and Company.\r\n  Bulletin 13, American School of Home Economics, Chicago.\r\n  Cornell University Reading Course, Buls. 6 and 7, _Human\r\n    Nutrition._\r\n  Davison, _The Human Body and Health._ American Book Company.\r\n  Jordan, _The Principles of Human Nutrition._ The Macmillan\r\n    Company.\r\n  Kehler, L.

A plant, however, is unable to make use of\r\nthe food in this condition. Before it can be transported from one part of\r\nthe plant body to another, it is changed into a soluble form. In this state\r\nit can be passed from cell to cell by the process of osmosis. Much the same\r\ncondition exists in animals. In order that food may be of use to man, it\r\nmust be changed into a state that will allow of its passage in a soluble\r\nform through the walls of the alimentary canal, or food tube. This is done\r\nby the enzymes which cause digestion. It will be the purpose of this\r\nchapter to discover where and how digestion takes place in our own body.\r\n\r\nAlimentary Canal.--In all vertebrate animals, including man, food is taken\r\nin the mouth and passed through a _food tube_ in which it is digested. This\r\ntube is composed of different portions, named, respectively, as we pass\r\nfrom the _mouth_ downward, the _gullet_, _stomach_, _small_ and _large\r\nintestine_, and _rectum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The digestive tract of the frog and man. _Gul_, gullet; _S_,\r\nstomach; _L_, liver; _G_, gall bladder; _P_, pancreas; _Sp_, spleen; _SI_,\r\nsmall intestine; _LI_, large intestine; _V_, appendix; _A_, anus.]\r\n\r\nComparison of Food Tube of a Frog and Man.--If we compare the food tube of\r\na dissected frog with the food tube of man (as shown by a manikin or\r\nchart), we find part for part they are much the same. But we notice that\r\nthe intestines of man, both small and large, are relatively longer than in\r\nthe frog. We also notice in man the body cavity or space in which the\r\ninternal organs rest is divided in two parts by a wall of muscle, the\r\n_diaphragm_, which separates the heart and lungs from the other internal\r\norgans. In the frog no muscular diaphragm exists. In the frog we can see\r\nplainly the silvery transparent _mesentery_ or double fold of the lining of\r\nthe body cavity in which the organs of digestion are suspended. Numerous\r\nblood vessels can be found especially in the walls of the food tube.\r\n\r\nGlands.--In addition to the alimentary canal proper, we find a number of\r\n_digestive glands_, varying in size and position, connected with the canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of a gland. _i_, the common tube which carries off\r\nthe secretions formed in the cells lining the cavity _c_; _a_, arteries\r\ncarrying blood to the glands; _v_, veins taking blood away from the\r\nglands.]\r\n\r\nWhat a Gland Does. Enzymes.--In man there are the saliva gland of the\r\nmouth, the gastric glands of the stomach, the pancreas and liver, the two\r\nlatter connected with the small intestine, and the intestinal glands in the\r\nwalls of the intestine. Besides glands which aid in digestion there are\r\nseveral others of which we will speak later. As we have already learned, a\r\ngland is a collection of cells which takes up material from within the body\r\nand manufactures from it something which is later poured out as a\r\nsecretion. An example of a gland in plants is found in the nectar-secreting\r\ncells of a flower.\r\n\r\nCertain substances, called _enzymes_, formed by glands cause the digestion\r\nof food. The enzymes secreted by the cells of the glands and poured out\r\ninto the food tube act upon insoluble foods so as to change them to a\r\nsoluble form. They are the product of the activity of the cell, although\r\nthey are not themselves alive. We do not know much about enzymes\r\nthemselves, but we can observe what they do. Some enzymes render soluble\r\ndifferent foods, others work in the blood, still others probably act within\r\nany cell of the body as an aid to oxidation, when work is done. Enzymes are\r\nvery sensitive to changes in temperature and to the degree of _acidity_ or\r\n_alkalinity_[42] of the material in which they act. We will find that the\r\nenzymes found in glands in the mouth will not act long in the stomach\r\nbecause of the change from an alkaline surrounding in the mouth to that of\r\nan acid in the stomach. Enzymes seem to be able to work indefinitely,\r\nproviding the surroundings are favorable. A small amount of digestive\r\nfluid, if it had long enough to work, could therefore digest an indefinite\r\namount of food.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 42: The teacher should explain the meaning of these\r\n     terms.\r\n\r\nGland Structure.--The entire inner surface of the food tube is covered with\r\na soft lining of _mucous membrane_. This is always moist because certain\r\ncells, called _mucus cells_, empty out their contents into the food tube,\r\nthus lubricating its inner surface. When a large number of cells which have\r\nthe power to secrete fluids are collected together, the surface of the food\r\ntube may become indented at this point to form a pitlike _gland_. Often\r\nsuch depressions are branched, thus giving a greater secreting surface, as\r\nis seen in the figure on page 298. The cells of the gland are always\r\nsupplied with blood vessels and nerves, for the secretions of the glands\r\nare under the control of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nHow a Gland Secretes.--We must therefore imagine that as the blood goes to\r\nthe cells of a gland it there loses some substances which the gland cells\r\ntake out and make over into the particular enzyme that they are called upon\r\nto manufacture. Under certain conditions, such as the sight or smell of\r\nfood, or even the desire for it, the activity of the gland is stimulated.\r\nIt then pours out its secretion containing the digestive enzyme. Thus a\r\ngland does its work.\r\n\r\nSalivary Glands.--We are all familiar with the substance called _saliva_\r\nwhich acts as a lubricant in the mouth. Saliva is manufactured in the cells\r\nof three pairs of glands which empty into the mouth, and which are called,\r\naccording to their position, the _parotid_ (beside the ear), the\r\n_submaxillary_ (under the jawbone), and the _sublingual_ (under the\r\ntongue).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment showing non-osmosis of starch in tube _A_, and\r\nosmosis of sugar in tube _B_.]\r\n\r\nDigestion of Starch.--If we collect some saliva in a test tube, add to it a\r\nlittle starch paste, place the tube containing the mixture for a few\r\nminutes in tepid water, and then test with Fehling's solution, we shall\r\nfind grape sugar present. Careful tests of the starch paste and of the\r\nsaliva made separately will usually show no grape sugar in either.\r\n\r\nIf another test be made for grape sugar, in a test tube containing starch\r\npaste, saliva, and a few drops of any weak acid, the starch will be found\r\nnot to have changed. The digestion or change of starch to grape sugar is\r\ncaused by the presence in the saliva of an _enzyme_, or _digestive\r\nferment_. You will remember that starch in the growing corn grain was\r\nchanged to grape sugar by an enzyme called _diastase_. Here a similar\r\naction is caused by an enzyme called _ptyalin_. This ferment acts _only_ in\r\nan alkaline medium at about the temperature of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The mouth cavity of man. _e_, Eustachian tube; _hp_, hard\r\npalate; _sp_, soft palate; _ut_, upper teeth; _bc_, buccal cavity; _lt_,\r\nlower teeth; _t_, tongue; _ph_, pharynx; _ep_, epiglottis; _lx_, voice box;\r\n_oe_, gullet; _tr_, trachea.]\r\n\r\nMouth Cavity in Man.--In our study of a frog we find that the mouth cavity\r\nhas two unpaired and four paired tubes leading from it. These are (_a_) the\r\n_gullet_ or food tube, (_b_) the _windpipe_ (in the frog opening through\r\nthe _glottis_), (_c_) the paired nostril holes (_posterior nares_), (_d_)\r\nthe paired _Eustachian tubes_, leading to the ear. All of these openings\r\nare found in man.\r\n\r\nIn man the mouth cavity, and all internal surfaces of the food tube, are\r\nlined with a _mucous membrane_. The _mucus_ secreted from gland cells in\r\nthis lining makes a slippery surface so that the food may slip down easily.\r\nThe roof of the mouth is formed in front by a plate of bone called the\r\n_hard palate_, and a softer continuation to the back of the mouth, the\r\n_soft palate_. These separate the nose cavity from that of the mouth\r\nproper. The part of the space back of the soft palate is called the\r\n_pharynx_, or throat cavity. From the pharynx lead off the _gullet_ and\r\n_windpipe_, the former back of the latter. The lower part of the mouth\r\ncavity is occupied by a muscular tongue. Examination of its surface with a\r\nlooking-glass shows it to be almost covered in places by tiny projections\r\ncalled _papillae_. These papillae contain organs known as _taste buds_, the\r\nsensory endings of which determine the taste of substances. The tongue is\r\nused in moving food about in the mouth, and in starting it on its way to\r\nthe gullet; it also plays an important part in speaking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I. Teeth of the upper jaw, from below. _1, 2_, incisors;\r\n_3_, canine; _4, 5_, premolars; _6, 7, 8_, molars. II. longitudinal section\r\nof a tooth. _E_, enamel; _D_, dentine; _C_, cement; _P_, pulp cavity.]\r\n\r\nThe Teeth.--In man the teeth, unlike those of the frog, are used in the\r\nmechanical preparation of the food for digestion. Instead of holding prey,\r\nthey crush, grind, or tear food so that more surface may be given for the\r\naction of the digestive fluids. The teeth of man are divided, according to\r\ntheir functions, into four groups. In the center of both the upper and\r\nlower jaw in front are found eight teeth with chisel-like edges, four in\r\neach jaw; these are the _incisors_, or cutting teeth. Next is found a\r\nsingle tooth on each side (four in all); these have rather sharp points and\r\nare called the _canines_. Then come two teeth on each side, eight in all,\r\ncalled _premolars_. Lastly, the _flat-top molars_, or grinding teeth, of\r\nwhich there are six in each jaw. Food is caught between irregular\r\nprojections on the surface of the molars and crushed to a pulpy mass.\r\n\r\nHygiene of the Mouth.--Food should simply be chewed and relished, with no\r\nthought of swallowing. There should be no more effort to prevent than to\r\nforce swallowing. It will be found that if you attend only to the agreeable\r\ntask of extracting the flavors of your food, Nature will take care of the\r\nswallowing, and this will become, like breathing, involuntary. The instinct\r\nby which most people eat is perverted through the \"hurry habit\" and the use\r\nof abnormal foods. Thorough mastication takes time, and therefore one must\r\nnot feel hurried at meals if the best results are to be secured. The\r\nstopping point for eating should be at the _earliest_ moment after one is\r\nreally satisfied.\r\n\r\nCare of the Teeth.--It has been recently found that fruit acids are very\r\nbeneficial to the teeth. Vinegar diluted to about half strength with water\r\nmakes an excellent dental wash. Clean your teeth carefully each morning and\r\nbefore going to bed. Use dental silk after meals. We must remember that the\r\nbacteria which cause decay of the teeth are washed down into the stomach\r\nand may do even more harm there than in the mouth.\r\n\r\nHow Food is Swallowed.--After food has been chewed and mixed with saliva,\r\nit is rolled into little balls and pushed by the tongue into such position\r\nthat the muscles of the throat cavity may seize it and force it downward.\r\nFood, in order to reach the gullet from the mouth cavity, must pass over\r\nthe opening into the windpipe. When food is in the course of being\r\nswallowed, the upper part of this tube forms a trapdoor over the opening.\r\nWhen this trapdoor is not closed, and food \"goes down the wrong way,\" we\r\nchoke, and the food is expelled by coughing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Peristaltic waves on the gullet of man. (A bolus means\r\nlittle ball.)]\r\n\r\nThe Gullet, or Esophagus.--Like the rest of the food tube the gullet is\r\nlined by soft and moist mucous membrane. The wall is made up of two sets of\r\nmuscles,--the inside ones running around the tube; the outer layer of\r\nmuscle taking a longitudinal course. After food leaves the mouth cavity, it\r\ngets beyond our direct control, and the muscles of the gullet, stimulated\r\nto activity by the presence of food in the tube, push the food down to the\r\nstomach by a series of contractions until it reaches the stomach. These\r\nwavelike movements (called _peristaltic_ movements) are characteristic of\r\nother parts of the food tube, food being pushed along in the stomach and\r\nthe small intestine by a series of slow-moving muscular waves. Peristaltic\r\nmovement is caused by muscles which are not under voluntary nervous\r\ncontrol, although anger, fear, or other unpleasant emotions have the effect\r\nof slowing them up or even stopping them entirely.\r\n\r\nStomach of Man.--The stomach is a pear-shaped organ capable of holding\r\nabout three pints. The end opposite to the gullet, which empties into the\r\nsmall intestine, is provided with a ring of muscle forming a valve called\r\nthe _pylorus_. There is also another ring of muscle guarding the entrance\r\nto the stomach.\r\n\r\nGastric Glands.--If we open the stomach of the frog, and remove its\r\ncontents by carefully washing, its wall is seen to be thrown into folds\r\ninternally. Between the folds in the stomach of man, as well as in the\r\nfrog, are located a number of tiny pits. These form the mouths of the\r\n_gastric glands_, which pour into the stomach a secretion known as the\r\n_gastric juice_. The gastric glands are little tubes, the lining of which\r\nsecretes the fluid. When we think of or see appetizing food, this secretion\r\nis given out in considerable quantity. The stomach, like the mouth,\r\n\"waters\" at the sight of food. Gastric juice is slightly acid in its\r\nchemical reaction, containing about .2 per cent free _hydrochloric acid_.\r\nIt also contains two very important enzymes, one called _pepsin_, and\r\nanother less important one called _rennin_.\r\n\r\nAction of Gastric Juice.--If protein is treated with artificial gastric\r\njuice at the temperature of the body, it will be found to become swollen\r\nand then gradually to change to a substance which is soluble in water. This\r\nis like the action of the gastric juice upon proteins in the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe other enzyme of gastric juice, called _rennin_, curdles or coagulates a\r\nprotein found in milk; after the milk is curdled, the pepsin is able to act\r\nupon it. \"Junket\" tablets, which contain rennin, are used in the kitchen to\r\ncause this change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A peptic gland, from the stomach, very much magnified. _A_,\r\ncentral or chief cell, which makes pepsin; _B_, border cells, which make\r\nacid. (From Miller's _Histology_.)]\r\n\r\nThe hydrochloric acid found in the gastric juice acts upon lime and some\r\nother salts taken into the stomach with food, changing them so that they\r\nmay pass into the blood and eventually form the mineral part of bone or\r\nother tissue. The acid also has a decided antiseptic influence in\r\npreventing growth of bacteria which cause decay, and some of which might\r\ncause disease.\r\n\r\nMovement of Walls of Stomach.--The stomach walls, provided with three\r\nlayers of muscle which run in an oblique, circular, and longitudinal\r\ndirection (taken from the inside outward), are well fitted for the constant\r\nchurning of the food in that organ. Here, as elsewhere in the digestive\r\ntract, the muscles are involuntary, muscular action being under the control\r\nof the so-called _sympathetic nervous system_. Food material in the stomach\r\nmakes several complete circuits during the process of digestion in that\r\norgan. Contrary to common belief, the greatest amount of food is digested\r\n_after_ it leaves the stomach. But this organ keeps the food in it in\r\nalmost constant motion for a considerable time, a meal of meat and\r\nvegetables remaining in the stomach for three or four hours. While movement\r\nis taking place, the gastric juice acts upon proteins, softening them,\r\nwhile the constant churning movement tends to separate the bits of food\r\ninto finer particles. Ultimately the semifluid food, much of it still\r\nundigested, is allowed to pass in small amounts through the pyloric valve,\r\ninto the small intestine. This is allowed by the relaxation of the ringlike\r\nmuscles of the pylorus.\r\n\r\nExperiments on Digestion in the Stomach.--Some very interesting experiments\r\nhave recently been made by Professor Cannon of Harvard with reference to\r\nmovements of the stomach contents. Cats were fed with material having in it\r\nbismuth, a harmless chemical that would be visible under the X-ray. It was\r\nfound that shortly after food reached the stomach a series of waves began\r\nwhich sent the food toward the pyloric end of the stomach. If the cat was\r\nfeeling happy and well, these contractions continued regularly, but if the\r\ncat was cross or bad tempered, the movements would stop. This shows the\r\nimportance of _cheerfulness_ at meals. Other experiments showed that food\r\nwhich was churned into a soft mass was only permitted to leave the stomach\r\nwhen it became thoroughly permeated by the gastric juice. It is the _acid_\r\nin the partly digested food that causes the stomach valve to open and allow\r\nits contents to escape little by little into the small intestine.\r\n\r\nThe partly digested food in the small intestine almost immediately comes in\r\ncontact with fluids from two glands, the liver and pancreas. We shall first\r\nconsider the function of the pancreas.\r\n\r\nPosition and Structure of the Pancreas.--The most important digestive gland\r\nin the human body is the pancreas. The gland is a rather diffuse structure;\r\nits duct empties by a common opening with the bile duct into the small\r\nintestine, a short distance below the pylorus. In internal structure, the\r\npancreas resembles the salivary glands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Appearance of milk under the microscope, showing the natural\r\ngrouping of the fat globules. In the circle a single group is highly\r\nmagnified. Milk is one form of an emulsion. (S. M. Babcock, Wis. Bul. No.\r\n61.)]\r\n\r\nWork done by the Pancreas.--Starch paste added to artificial pancreatic\r\nfluid and kept at blood heat is soon changed to sugar. Protein, under the\r\nsame conditions, is changed to a peptone. Fats, which so far have been\r\nunchanged except to be melted by the heat of the body, are changed by the\r\naction of the pancreas into a form which can pass through the walls of the\r\nfood tube. If we test pancreatic fluid, we find it strongly _alkaline_ in\r\nits reaction. If two test tubes, one containing olive oil and water, the\r\nother olive oil and a weak solution of caustic soda, an _alkali_, be shaken\r\nviolently and then allowed to stand, the oil and water will quickly\r\nseparate, while the oil, caustic soda, and water will remain for some time\r\nin a milky _emulsion_. If this emulsion be examined under the microscope,\r\nit will be found to be made of millions of little droplets of fat, floating\r\nin the liquid. The presence of the caustic soda helped the forming of the\r\nemulsion. Pancreatic fluid similarly emulsifies fats and changes them into\r\nsoft soaps and fatty acids. Fat in this form may be absorbed. The process\r\nof this transformation is not well understood.\r\n\r\nConditions under which the Pancreas does its Work.--The secretion from this\r\ngland seems to be influenced by the overflow of acid material from the\r\nstomach. This acid, on striking the lining of the small intestine, causes\r\nthe formation in its walls of a substance known as _secretin_. This\r\nsecretin reaches the blood and seems to stimulate all the glands pouring\r\nfluid into the intestine to do more work. A pint or more of pancreatic\r\nfluid is secreted every day.\r\n\r\nThe Intestinal Fluid.--Three different pancreatic enzymes do the work of\r\ndigestion, one acting on starch, another on protein, and a third on fats.\r\nIt has been found that some of these enzymes will not do their work unless\r\naided by the _intestinal_ fluid, a secretion formed in glands in the walls\r\nof the small intestine. This fluid, though not much is known about it, is\r\nbelieved to play an important part in the digestion of all kinds of foods\r\nleft undigested in the small intestine.\r\n\r\nLiver.--The liver is the largest gland in the body. In man, it hangs just\r\nbelow the diaphragm, a little to the right side of the body. During life,\r\nits color is deep red. It is divided into three lobes, between two of which\r\nis found the _gall bladder_, a thin-walled sac which holds the _bile_, a\r\nsecretion of the liver. Bile is a strongly alkaline fluid of greenish\r\ncolor. It reaches the intestine through the same opening as the pancreatic\r\nfluid. Almost one quart of bile is passed daily into the digestive canal.\r\nThe color of bile is due to certain waste substances which come from the\r\ndestruction of worn-out red corpuscles of the blood. This destruction takes\r\nplace in the liver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of a bit of the wall of the small intestine, greatly\r\nmagnified, _a_, mouths of intestinal glands; _b_, villus cut lengthwise to\r\nshow blood vessels and lacteal (in center); _e_, lacteal sending branches\r\nto other villi; _i_, intestinal glands; _m_, artery; _v_, vein; _l_, _t_,\r\nmuscular coats of intestine wall.]\r\n\r\nFunctions of Bile.--The action of bile is not very well known. It has the\r\nvery important faculty of aiding the pancreatic fluid in digestion, though\r\nalone it has slight if any digestive power. Certain substances in the bile\r\naid especially in the absorption of fats. Bile seems to be mostly a waste\r\nproduct from the blood and as such incidentally serves to keep the contents\r\nof the intestine in a more or less soft condition, thus preventing extreme\r\nconstipation.\r\n\r\nThe Liver a Storehouse.--Perhaps the most important function of the liver\r\nis the formation within it of a material called _glycogen_, or animal\r\nstarch. The liver is supplied by blood from two sources. The greater amount\r\nof blood received by the liver comes directly from the walls of the stomach\r\nand intestine to this organ. It normally contains about one fifth of all\r\nthe blood in the body. This blood is very rich in food materials, and from\r\nit the cells of the liver take out sugars to form glycogen.[43] Glycogen is\r\nstored in the liver until such a time as a food is needed that can be\r\nquickly oxidized; then it is changed to sugar and carried off by the blood\r\nto the tissue which requires it, and there used for this purpose. Glycogen\r\nis also stored in the muscles, where it is oxidized to release energy when\r\nthe muscles are exercised.\r\n\r\n     Footnote 43: It is known that glycogen _may_ be formed in\r\n     the body from protein, and possibly from fatty foods.\r\n\r\nThe Absorption of Digested Food into the Blood.--The object of digestion is\r\nto change foods from an insoluble to a soluble form. This has been seen in\r\nthe study of the action of the various digestive fluids in the body, each\r\nof which is seen to aid in dissolving solid foods, changing them to a\r\nfluid, and, in case of the bile, actually assisting them to pass through\r\nthe wall of the intestine. A small amount of digested food may be absorbed\r\nby the blood in the blood vessels of the walls of the stomach. Most of the\r\nabsorption, however, takes place through the walls of the small intestine.\r\n\r\nStructure of the Small Intestine.--The small intestine in man is a slender\r\ntube nearly twenty feet in length and about one inch in diameter. If the\r\nchief function of the small intestine is that of absorption, we must look\r\nfor adaptations which increase the absorbing surface of the tube. This is\r\ngained in part by the inner surface of the tube being thrown into\r\ntransverse folds which not only retard the rapidity with which food passes\r\ndown the intestine, but also give more absorbing surface. But far more\r\nimportant for absorption are millions of little projections which cover the\r\ninner surface of the small intestine.\r\n\r\nThe Villi.--So numerous are these projections that the whole surface\r\npresents a velvety appearance. Collectively, these structures are called\r\nthe _villi_ (singular _villus_). They form the chief organs of absorption\r\nin the intestine, several thousand being distributed over every square inch\r\nof surface. By means of the folds and villi the small intestine is\r\nestimated to have an absorbing surface equal to twice that of the surface\r\nof the body. Between the villi are found the openings of the _intestinal\r\nglands_.\r\n\r\nInternal Structure of a Villus.--The internal structure of a villus is best\r\nseen in a longitudinal section. We find the outer wall made up of a thin\r\nlayer of cells, the _epithelial_ layer. It is the duty of these cells to\r\nabsorb the semifluid food from within the intestine. Underneath these cells\r\nlies a network of very tiny blood vessels, while inside of these, occupying\r\nthe core of the villus, are found spaces which, because of their white\r\nappearance after absorption of fats, have been called _lacteals_. (See\r\nfigure, page 307.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram to show how the nutrients reach the blood.]\r\n\r\nAbsorption of Foods.--Let us now attempt to find out exactly how foods are\r\npassed from the intestines into the blood. Food substances in solution may\r\nbe soaked up as a sponge would take up water, or they may pass by osmosis\r\ninto the cells lining the villus. These cells break down the peptones into\r\na substance that will pass into and become part of the blood. Once within\r\nthe villus, the sugars and digested proteins pass through tiny blood\r\nvessels into the larger vessels comprising the _portal circulation_. These\r\npass through the liver, where, as we have seen, sugar is taken from the\r\nblood and stored as glycogen. From the liver, the food within the blood is\r\nsent to the heart, from there is pumped to the lungs, from there returns to\r\nthe heart, and is pumped to the tissues of the body. A large amount of\r\nwater and some salts are also absorbed through the walls of the stomach and\r\nintestine as the food passes on its course. The fats in the form of soaps\r\nand fatty acids pass into the space in the center of the villus. Later they\r\nare changed into fats again, probably in certain groups of gland cells\r\nknown as _mesenteric_ glands, and eventually reach the blood by way of the\r\nthoracic duct without passing through the liver.\r\n\r\nLarge Intestine.--The large intestine has somewhat the same structure as\r\nthe small intestine, except that it lacks the villi and has a greater\r\ndiameter. Considerable absorption, however, takes place through its walls\r\nas the mass of food and refuse material is slowly pushed along by the\r\nmuscles within its walls.\r\n\r\nVermiform Appendix.--At the point where the small intestine widens to form\r\nthe large intestine, a baglike pouch is formed. From one side of this pouch\r\nis given off a small tube about four inches long, closed at the lower end.\r\nThis tube, the rudiment of what is an important part of the food tube in\r\nthe lower vertebrates, is called the _vermiform appendix_. It has come to\r\nhave unpleasant notoriety in late years, as the site of serious\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nConstipation.--In the large intestine live millions of bacteria, some of\r\nwhich make and give off poisonous substances known as toxins. These\r\nsubstances are easily absorbed through the walls of the large intestine,\r\nand, when they pass into the blood, cause headaches or sometimes serious\r\ntrouble. Hence it follows that the lower bowel should be emptied of this\r\nmatter as frequently as possible, at least once a day. Constipation is one\r\nof the most serious evils the American people have to deal with, and it is\r\nlargely brought about by the artificial life which we lead, with its lack\r\nof exercise, fresh air, and sleep. Fruit with meals, especially at\r\nbreakfast, plenty of water between meals and before breakfast, exercise,\r\nparticularly of the abdominal muscles, and regular habits will all help to\r\ncorrect this evil.\r\n\r\nHygienic Habits of Eating; the Causes and Prevention of Dyspepsia.--From\r\nthe contents of the foregoing chapter it is evident that the object of the\r\nprocess of digestion is to break up solid food so that it may be absorbed\r\nto form part of the blood. Any habits we may form of thoroughly chewing our\r\nfood will evidently aid in this process. Undoubtedly much of the distress\r\nknown as dyspepsia is due to too hasty meals with consequent lack of proper\r\nmastication of food. The message of Mr. Horace Fletcher in bringing before\r\nus the need of proper mastication of food and the attendant evils of\r\novereating is one which we cannot afford to ignore. It is a good rule to go\r\naway from the table feeling a little hungry. Eating too much overtaxes the\r\ndigestive organs and prevents their working to the best advantage. Still\r\nanother cause of dyspepsia is eating when in a _fatigued_ condition. It is\r\nalways a good plan to rest a short time before eating, especially after any\r\nhard manual work. We have seen how great a part unpleasant emotions play in\r\npreventing peristaltic movements of the food tube. Conversely, pleasant\r\nconversation, laughter, and fun will help you to digest your meal. Eating\r\nbetween meals is condemned by physicians because it calls the blood to the\r\ndigestive organs at a time when it should be more active in other parts of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nEffect of Alcohol on Digestion.--It is a well-known fact that alcohol\r\nextracts water from tissues with which it is in contact. This fact works\r\nmuch harm to the interior surface of the food tube, especially the walls of\r\nthe stomach, which in the case of a hard drinker are likely to become\r\nirritated and much toughened. In very small amounts alcohol stimulates the\r\nsecretion of the salivary and gastric glands, and thus appears to aid in\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nThe following results of experiments on dogs, published in the _American\r\nJournal of Physiology_, Vol. I, Professor Chittenden of Yale University\r\ngives as \"strictly comparable,\" because \"they were carried out in\r\nsuccession on the same day.\" They show that alcohol retards rather than\r\naids in digestion:--\r\n\r\n  ==========================================================================\r\n    NUMBER OF EXPERIMENT  |1/16 LB.

In other words, the unquestionable acceleration of gastric\r\nsecretion which follows the ingestion of alcoholic beverages is, as a rule,\r\ncounterbalanced by the inhibitory effect of the alcoholic fluids upon the\r\nchemical process of gastric digestion, with perhaps at times a tendency\r\ntowards preponderance of inhibitory action.\" Others have come to the same\r\nor stronger conclusions as to the undesirable action of alcohol on\r\ndigestion, as a result of their own experiments.\r\n\r\nEffect of Alcohol on the Liver.--The effect of heavy drinking upon the\r\nliver is graphically shown in the following table prepared by the\r\nScientific Temperance Federation of Boston, Mass.:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Proportion of deaths from disease in a certain area due to\r\nalcohol.

THE BLOOD AND ITS CIRCULATION\r\n\r\n_Problems.--To discover the composition and uses of the different parts of\r\n              the blood._\r\n           _To find out the means by which the blood is circulated about the\r\n              body._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Demonstration._--Structure of blood, fresh frog's blood and\r\n       human blood. Drawings.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Clotting of blood.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Use of models to demonstrate that the\r\n       heart is a force pump.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Capillary circulation in web of frog's\r\n       foot or tadpole's tail. Drawing.\r\n     _Home or laboratory exercise._--On relation of exercise on\r\n       rate of heart beat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunction of the Blood.--The chief function of the digestive tract is to\r\nchange foods to such form that they can be absorbed through the walls of\r\nthe food tube and become part of the blood.[45]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 45: This change is due to the action of certain\r\n     enzymes upon the nutrients in various foods. But we also\r\n     find that peptones are changed back again to proteins when\r\n     once in the blood. This appears to be due to the\r\n     _reversible_ action of the enzymes acting upon them. (See\r\n     page 307.)\r\n\r\nIf we examine under the microscope a drop of blood taken from the frog or\r\nman, we find it made up of a fluid called _plasma_ and two kinds of bodies,\r\nthe so-called _red corpuscles_ and _colorless corpuscles_, floating in this\r\nplasma.\r\n\r\nComposition of Plasma.--The plasma of blood is found to be largely (about\r\n90 per cent) water. It also contains a considerable amount of protein, some\r\nsugar, fat, and mineral material. It is, then, the medium which holds the\r\nfluid food that has been absorbed from within the intestine. This food is\r\npumped to the body cells where, as work is performed, oxidation takes place\r\nand heat is given off as a form of energy. The almost constant temperature\r\nof the body is also due to the blood, which brings to the surface of the\r\nbody much of the heat given off by oxidation of food in the muscles and\r\nother tissues. When the blood returns from the tissues where the food is\r\noxidized, the plasma brings back with it to the lungs part of the carbon\r\ndioxide liberated where oxidation has taken place. Some waste products, to\r\nbe spoken of later, are also found in the plasma.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Human blood as seen under the high power of the compound\r\nmicroscope; at the extreme right is a colorless corpuscle.]\r\n\r\nThe Red Blood Corpuscle; its Structure and Functions.--The red corpuscle in\r\nthe blood of the frog is a true cell of disklike form, containing a\r\nnucleus. The red corpuscle of man is made in the red marrow of bones and in\r\nits young stages has a nucleus. In its adult form, however, it lacks a\r\nnucleus. Its form is that of a biconcave disk. So small and so numerous are\r\nthese corpuscles that over five million are found in a cubic centimeter of\r\nnormal blood. They make up almost one half the total volume of the blood.\r\nThe color, which is found to be a dirty yellow when separate corpuscles are\r\nviewed under the microscope, is due to a protein material called\r\n_haemoglobin_. Haemoglobin contains a large amount of iron. It has the power\r\nof uniting very readily with oxygen whenever that gas is abundant, and,\r\nafter having absorbed it, of giving it up to the surrounding media, when\r\noxygen is there present in smaller amounts than in the corpuscle. This\r\nfunction of carrying oxygen is the most important function of the red\r\ncorpuscle, although the red corpuscle also removes part of the carbon\r\ndioxide from the tissues on their return to the lungs. The taking up of\r\noxygen is accompanied by a change in color of the mass of corpuscles from a\r\ndull red to a bright scarlet.\r\n\r\nClotting of Blood.--If fresh beef blood is allowed to stand overnight,\r\nit will be found to have separated into two parts, a dark red, almost solid\r\n_clot_ and a thin, straw-colored liquid called _serum_. Serum is found to\r\nbe made up of about 90 per cent water, 8 per cent protein, 1 per cent\r\nother organic foods, and 1 per cent mineral substances. In these respects\r\nit very closely resembles the fluid food that is absorbed from the\r\nintestines.\r\n\r\nIf another jar of fresh beef blood is poured into a pan and briskly whipped\r\nwith a bundle of little rods (or with an egg beater), a stringy substance\r\nwill be found to stick to the rods. This, if washed carefully, is seen to\r\nbe almost colorless. Tested with nitric acid and ammonia, it is found to\r\ncontain a protein substance which is called _fibrin_.\r\n\r\nBlood plasma, then, is made up of a fluid portion of serum, and fibrin,\r\nwhich, although in a fluid state in the blood vessels within the body,\r\ncoagulates when blood is removed from the blood vessels. This coagulation\r\naids in making a blood clot. A clot is simply a mass of fibrin threads with\r\na large number of corpuscles tangled within. The clotting of blood is of\r\ngreat physiological importance, for otherwise we might bleed to death even\r\nfrom a small wound.\r\n\r\nBlood Plates.--In blood within the circulatory system of the body, the\r\nfibrin is held in a fluid state called _fibrinogen_. An enzyme, acting upon\r\nthis fibrinogen, the soluble protein in the blood, causes it to change to\r\nan insoluble form, the fibrin of the clot. This change seems to be due to\r\nthe action of minute bodies in the blood known as _blood plates_. Under\r\nabnormal conditions these blood plates break down, releasing some\r\nsubstances which eventually cause this enzyme to do its work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A small artery (_A_) breaking up into capillaries (_c_)\r\nwhich unite to form a vein (_V_). Note at (_P_) several colorless\r\ncorpuscles, which are fighting bacteria at that point.]\r\n\r\nThe Colorless Corpuscle; Structure and Functions.--A colorless corpuscle is\r\na cell irregular in outline, the shape of which is constantly changing.\r\nThese corpuscles are somewhat larger than the red corpuscles, but less\r\nnumerous, there being about one colorless corpuscle to every three hundred\r\nred ones. They have the power of movement, for they are found not only\r\ninside but outside the blood vessels, showing that they have worked their\r\nway between the cells that form the walls of the blood tubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A colorless corpuscle catching and eating germs.]\r\n\r\nA Russian zoologist, Metchnikoff, after studying a number of simple\r\nanimals, such as medusae and sponges, found that in such animals some of the\r\ncells lining the inside of the food cavity take up or engulf minute bits of\r\nfood. Later, this food is changed into the protoplasm of the cell.\r\nMetchnikoff believed that the colorless corpuscles of the blood have\r\nsomewhat the same function. This he later proved to be true. Like the\r\namoeba, they feed by engulfing their prey. This fact has a very important\r\nbearing on the relation of colorless corpuscles to certain diseases caused\r\nby bacteria within the body. If, for example, a cut becomes infected by\r\nbacteria, inflammation may set in. Colorless corpuscles at once surround\r\nthe spot and attack the bacteria which cause the inflammation. If the\r\nbacteria are few in number, they are quickly eaten by certain of the\r\ncolorless corpuscles, which are known as _phagocytes_. If bacteria are\r\npresent in great quantities, they may prevail and kill the phagocytes by\r\npoisoning them. The dead bodies of the phagocytes thus killed are found in\r\nthe pus, or matter, which accumulates in infected wounds. In such an event,\r\nwe must come to the aid of nature by washing the wound with some\r\nantiseptic, as weak carbolic acid or hydrogen peroxide.\r\n\r\nAntibodies and their Uses.--In case of disease where, for example, fever is\r\ncaused by poison given off from bacteria we find the cells of the body\r\nmanufacture and pour into the blood a substance known as an _antibody_.\r\nThis substance does not of necessity kill the harmful germs or even stop\r\ntheir growth. It does, however, unite with the toxin or poison given off by\r\nthe germs and renders it entirely harmless.\r\n\r\nFunction of Lymph.--The tissues and organs of the body are traversed by a\r\nnetwork of tubes which carry the blood. Inside these tubes is the blood\r\nproper, consisting of a fluid plasma, the colorless corpuscles, and the red\r\ncorpuscles. Outside the blood tubes, in spaces between the cells which form\r\ntissues, is found another fluid, which is in chemical composition very much\r\nlike plasma of the blood. This is the _lymph_. It is, in fact, fluid food\r\nin which some colorless amoeboid corpuscles are found. Blood gives up its\r\nfood material to the lymph. This it does by passing it through the walls of\r\nthe capillaries. The food is in turn given up to the tissue cells, which\r\nare bathed by the lymph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The exchange between blood and the cells of the body.]\r\n\r\nSome of the amoeboid corpuscles from the blood make their way between the\r\ncells forming the walls of the capillaries. _Lymph, then, is practically\r\nblood plasma plus some colorless corpuscles. It acts as the medium of\r\nexchange between the blood proper and the cells in the tissues of the\r\nbody._ By means of the food supply thus brought, the cells of the body are\r\nable to grow, the fluid food being changed to the protoplasm of the cells.\r\nBy means of the oxygen passed over by the lymph, oxidation may take place\r\nwithin the cells. Lymph not only gives food to the cells of the body, but\r\nalso takes away carbon dioxide and other waste materials, which are\r\nultimately passed out of the body by means of the lungs, skin, and kidneys.\r\n\r\nInternal Secretions.--In addition to all the functions given above, the\r\nblood has recently been shown to carry the secretions of a number of glands\r\nthrough which it passes, although these glands have no ducts to carry off\r\ntheir secretions. These internal secretions seem _absolutely necessary_ for\r\nthe health of the body. Several glands, the thyroid, adrenal bodies, the\r\ntestes, and ovaries, as well as the pancreas, give off these remarkable\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe Amount of Blood and its Distribution.--Blood forms, by weight, about\r\none sixteenth of the body. This would be about four quarts to a body weight\r\nof 130 pounds. Normally, about one half of the blood of the body is found\r\nin or near the organs lying in the body cavity below the diaphragm, about\r\none fourth in the muscles, and the rest in the head, heart, lungs, large\r\narteries, and veins.\r\n\r\nBlood Temperature.--The temperature of blood in the human body is normally\r\nabout 98.6 deg. Fahrenheit when tested under the tongue by a thermometer,\r\nalthough the temperature drops almost two degrees after we have gone to\r\nsleep at night. It is highest about 5 P.M. and lowest about 4 A.M. In\r\nfevers, the temperature of the body sometimes rises to 107 deg.; but unless\r\nthis temperature is soon reduced, death follows. Any considerable drop in\r\ntemperature below the normal also means death. Body heat results from the\r\noxidation of food, and the circulation of blood keeps the temperature\r\nnearly uniform in all parts of the body.\r\n\r\nCold-blooded Animals.--In animals which are called cold-blooded, the blood\r\nhas no fixed temperature, but varies with the temperature of the medium in\r\nwhich the animal lives. Frogs, in the summer, may sit for hours in water\r\nwith a temperature of almost 100 deg. In winter, they often endure freezing so\r\nthat the blood and lymph within the spaces under the loose skin are frozen\r\ninto ice crystals. This change in body temperature is evidently an\r\nadaptation to the mode of life.\r\n\r\nCirculation of the Blood in Man.--The blood is the carrying agent of the\r\nbody. Like a railroad or express company, it takes materials from one part\r\nof the human organism to another. This it does by means of the organs of\r\ncirculation,--the heart and blood vessels. These blood vessels are called\r\n_arteries_ where they carry blood away from the heart, _veins_ where they\r\nbring blood back to the heart, and _capillaries_ where they connect the\r\nlarger blood vessels. The organs of circulation thus form a system of\r\nconnected tubes through which the blood flows.\r\n\r\nThe Heart; Position, Size, Protection.--The heart is a cone-shaped muscular\r\norgan about the size of a man's fist. It is located immediately above the\r\ndiaphragm, and lies so that the muscular apex, which points downward, moves\r\nwhile beating against the fifth and sixth ribs, just a little to the left\r\nof the midline of the body. This fact gives rise to the notion that the\r\nheart is on the left side of the body. The heart is surrounded by a loose\r\nmembranous bag called the _pericardium_, the inner lining of which secretes\r\na fluid in which the heart lies. When, for any reason, the pericardial\r\nfluid is not secreted, inflammation arises in that region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing the front half of the heart cut away: _a_,\r\naorta; _l_, arteries to the lungs; _la_, left auricle; _lv_, left\r\nventricle; _m_, tricuspid valve open; _n_, bicuspid or mitral valve closed;\r\n_p_ and _r_, veins from the lungs; _ra_, right auricle; _rv_, right\r\nventricle; _v_, vena cava. Arrows show direction of circulation.]\r\n\r\nInternal Structure of Heart.--If we should cut open the heart of a mammal\r\ndown the midline, we could divide it into a right and a left side, _each of\r\nwhich would have no internal connection with the other_. Each side is made\r\nup of an upper thin-walled portion with a rather large internal cavity, the\r\n_auricle_, which opens into a lower smaller portion with heavy muscular\r\nwalls, the _ventricle_. Communication between auricles and ventricles is\r\nguarded by little flaps or _valves_. The auricles receive blood from the\r\nveins. The ventricles pump the blood into the arteries.\r\n\r\nThe Heart in Action.--The heart is constructed on the same plan as a force\r\npump, the valves preventing the reflux of blood into the auricle when it is\r\nforced out of the ventricle. Blood enters the auricles from the veins\r\nbecause the muscles of that part of the heart relax; this allows the space\r\nwithin the auricles to fill. Almost immediately the muscles of the\r\nventricles relax, thus allowing blood to pass into the chambers within the\r\nventricles. Then, after a short pause, during which time the muscles of the\r\nheart are resting, a wave of muscular contraction begins in the auricles\r\nand ends in the ventricles, with a sudden strong contraction which forces\r\nthe blood out into the arteries. Blood is kept on its course by the valves,\r\nwhich act in the same manner as do the valves in a pump. The blood is thus\r\nmade to pass into the arteries upon the contraction of the ventricle walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The heart is a force pump; prove it from these diagrams.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nI.

There are two distinct systems of circulation in the body. The\r\n_pulmonary circulation_ takes the blood through the right auricle and\r\nventricle, to the lungs, and passes it back to the left auricle. This is a\r\nrelatively short circulation, the blood receiving in the lungs its supply\r\nof oxygen, and there giving up some of its carbon dioxide. The greater\r\ncirculation is known as the _systemic circulation_; in this system, the\r\nblood leaves the left ventricle through the great dorsal _aorta_. A large\r\npart of the blood passes directly to the muscles; some of it goes to the\r\nnervous system, kidneys, skin, and other organs of the body. It gives up\r\nits supply of food and oxygen in these tissues, receives the waste products\r\nof oxidation while passing through the capillaries, and returns to the\r\nright auricle through two large vessels known as the _venae cavae_. It\r\nrequires only from twenty to thirty seconds for the blood to make the\r\ncomplete circulation from the ventricle back again to the starting point.\r\nThis means that the entire volume of blood in the human body passes three\r\nor four thousand times a day through the various organs of the body.[46]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 46: See Hough and Sedgwick, _The Human Mechanism_,\r\n     page 136.\r\n\r\nPortal Circulation.--Some of the blood, on its way back to the heart,\r\npasses to the walls of the food tube and to its glands. From there it is\r\nsent with its load of absorbed food to the liver. Here the vein which\r\ncarries the blood (called the portal vein) breaks up into capillaries\r\naround the cells of the liver, when it gives up sugar to be stored as\r\nglycogen. From the liver, blood passes directly to the right auricle. The\r\n_portal circulation_, as it is called, is the only part of the circulation\r\nwhere the blood passes through two sets of capillaries on its way from\r\nauricle to auricle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Capillary circulation in the web of a frog's foot, as seen\r\nunder the compound microscope. _a_, _b_, small veins; _c_, pigment cells in\r\nthe skin; _d_, capillaries in which the oval corpuscles are seen to follow\r\none another in single series.]\r\n\r\nCirculation in the Web of a Frog's Foot.--If the web of the foot of a live\r\nfrog or the tail of a tadpole is examined under the compound microscope, a\r\nnetwork of blood vessels will be seen. In some of the larger vessels the\r\ncorpuscles are moving rapidly and in spurts; these are _arteries_. The\r\narteries lead into smaller vessels hardly greater in diameter than the\r\nwidth of a single corpuscle. This network of _capillaries_ may be followed\r\ninto larger _veins_ in which the blood moves regularly. This illustrates\r\nthe condition in any tissue of man where the arteries break up into\r\ncapillaries, and these in turn unite to form veins.\r\n\r\nStructure of the Arteries.--A distinct difference in structure exists\r\nbetween the arteries and the veins in the human body. The arteries, because\r\nof the greater strain received from the blood which is pumped from the\r\nheart, have thicker muscular walls, and in addition are very elastic.\r\n\r\nCause of the Pulse.--The _pulse_, which can easily be detected by pressing\r\nthe large artery in the wrist or the small one in front of and above the\r\nexternal ear, is caused by the gushing of blood through the arteries after\r\neach pulsation of the heart. As the large arteries pass away from the\r\nheart, the diameter of each individual artery becomes smaller. At the very\r\nend of their course, these arteries are so small as to be almost\r\nmicroscopic in size and are very numerous. There are so many that if they\r\nwere placed together, side by side, their united diameter would be much\r\ngreater than the diameter of the large artery (_aorta_) which passes blood\r\nfrom the left side of the heart. This fact is of very great importance, for\r\nthe force of the blood as it gushes through the arteries becomes very much\r\nless when it reaches the smaller vessels. This gushing movement is quite\r\nlost when the capillaries are reached, first, because there is so much more\r\nspace for the blood to fill, and second, because there is considerable\r\nfriction caused by the very tiny diameter of the capillaries.\r\n\r\nCapillaries.--The capillaries form a network of minute tubes everywhere in\r\nthe body, but especially near the surface and in the lungs. It is through\r\ntheir walls that the food and oxygen pass to the tissues, and carbon\r\ndioxide is given up to the plasma. They form the connection that completes\r\nthe system of circulation of blood in the body.\r\n\r\nFunction and Structure of the Veins.--If the arteries are supply pipes\r\nwhich convey fluid food to the tissues, then the veins may be likened to\r\ndrain pipes which carry away waste material from the tissues. Extremely\r\nnumerous in the extremities and in the muscles and among other tissues of\r\nthe body, they, like the branches of a tree, become larger and unite with\r\neach other as they approach the heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Valves in a vein. Notice the thin walls of the vein.]\r\n\r\nIf the wall of a vein is carefully examined, it will be found to be neither\r\nso thick nor so tough as an artery wall. When empty, a vein collapses; the\r\nwall of an artery holds its shape. If you hold your hand downward for a\r\nlittle time and then examine it, you will find that the veins, which are\r\nrelatively much nearer the surface than are the arteries, appear to be very\r\nmuch knotted. This appearance is due to the presence of tiny valves within.\r\nThese valves open in the direction of the blood current, but would close if\r\nthe direction of the blood flow should be reversed (as in case a deep cut\r\nsevered a vein). As the pressure of blood in the veins is much less than in\r\nthe arteries, the valves thus aid in keeping the flow of blood in the veins\r\ntoward the heart. The higher pressure in arteries and the suction in the\r\nveins (caused by the enlargement of the chest cavity in breathing) are the\r\nchief factors which cause a steady flow of blood through the veins in the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nLymph Vessels.--The lymph is collected from the various tissues of the body\r\nby means of a number of very thin-walled tubes, which are at first very\r\ntiny, but after repeated connection with other tubes ultimately unite to\r\nform large ducts. These lymph ducts are provided, like the veins, with\r\nvalves. The pressure of the blood within the blood vessels forces\r\ncontinually more plasma into the lymph; thus a slow current is maintained.\r\nOn its course the lymph passes through many collections of gland cells, the\r\n_lymph glands_. In these glands some impurities appear to be removed and\r\ncolorless corpuscles made. The lymph ultimately passes into a large tube,\r\nthe _thoracic duct_, which flows upward near the ventral side of the spinal\r\ncolumn, and empties into the large subclavian vein in the left side of the\r\nneck. Another smaller lymph duct enters the right subclavian vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The lymph vessels; the dark spots are lymph glands: _lac_,\r\nlacteals; _rc_, thoracic duct.]\r\n\r\nThe Lacteals.--We have already found that part of the digested food\r\n(chiefly carbohydrates, proteins, salts, and water) is absorbed directly\r\ninto the blood through the walls of the villi and carried to the liver.\r\nFat, however, is passed into the spaces in the central part of the villi,\r\nand from there into other spaces between the tissues, known as the\r\n_lacteals_. The lacteals carry the fats into the blood by way of the\r\nthoracic duct. The lacteals and lymph vessels have in part the same course.\r\n It will be thus seen that lymph at different parts of its course would\r\nhave a very different composition.\r\n\r\nThe Nervous Control of the Heart and Blood Vessels.--Although the muscles\r\nof the heart contract and relax without our being able to stop them or\r\nforce them to go faster, yet in cases of sudden fright, or after a sudden\r\nblow, the heart may stop beating for a short interval. This shows that the\r\nheart is under the control of the nervous system. Two sets of nerve fibers,\r\nboth of which are connected with the central nervous system, pass to the\r\nheart. One set of fibers accelerates, the other slows or inhibits, the\r\nheart beat. The arteries and veins are also under the control of the\r\nsympathetic nervous system. This allows of a change in the diameter of the\r\nblood vessels. Thus, blushing is due to a sudden rush of blood to the\r\nsurface of the body caused by an expansion of the blood vessels at the\r\nsurface. The blood vessels of the body are always full of blood. This\r\nresults from an automatic regulation of the diameter of the blood tubes by\r\na part of the nervous system called the _vasomotor nerves_. These nerves\r\nact upon the muscles in the walls of the blood vessels. In this way, each\r\nvessel adapts itself to the amount of blood in it at a given time. After a\r\nhearty meal, a large supply of blood is needed in the walls of the stomach\r\nand intestines. At this time, the arteries going to this region are dilated\r\nso as to receive an extra supply. When the brain performs hard work, blood\r\nis supplied in the same manner to that region. Hence, one should not study\r\nor do mental work immediately after a hearty meal, for blood will be drawn\r\naway to the brain, leaving the digestive tract with an insufficient supply.\r\nIndigestion may follow as a result.\r\n\r\nThe Effect of Exercise on the Circulation.--It is a fact familiar to all\r\nthat the heart beats more violently and quickly when we are doing hard work\r\nthan when we are resting. Count your own pulse when sitting quietly, and\r\nthen again after some brisk exercise in the gymnasium. Exercise in\r\nmoderation is of undoubted value, because it sends the increased amount of\r\nblood to such parts of the body where increased oxidation has been taking\r\nplace as the result of the exercise. The best forms of exercise are those\r\nwhich give as many muscles as possible work--walking, out-of-door sports,\r\nany exercise that is not violent. Exercise should not be attempted\r\nimmediately after eating, as this causes a withdrawal of blood from the\r\ndigestive tract to the muscles of the body. Neither should exercise be\r\ncontinued after becoming tired, as poisons are then formed in the muscles,\r\nwhich cause the feeling we call _fatigue_. Remember that extra work given\r\nto the heart by extreme exercise may injure it, causing possible trouble\r\nwith the valves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stopping flow of blood from an artery by applying a tight\r\nbandage (ligature) between the cut and the heart.]\r\n\r\nTreatment of Cuts and Bruises.--Blood which oozes slowly from a cut will\r\nusually stop flowing by the natural means of the formation of a clot. A cut\r\nor bruise should, however, be washed in a weak solution of carbolic acid or\r\nsome other antiseptic in order to prevent bacteria from obtaining a\r\nfoothold on the exposed flesh. If blood, issuing from a wound, gushes in\r\ndistinct pulsations, then we know that an artery has been severed. To\r\nprevent the flow of blood, a tight bandage known as a _tourniquet_ must be\r\ntied between the cut and the heart. A handkerchief with a knot placed over\r\nthe artery may stop bleeding if the cut is on one of the limbs. If this\r\ndoes not serve, then insert a stick in the handkerchief and twist it so as\r\nto make the pressure around the limb still greater. Thus we may close the\r\nartery until the doctor is called, who may sew up the injured blood vessel.\r\n\r\nThe Effect of Alcohol upon the Blood.--It has recently been discovered that\r\nalcohol has an extremely injurious effect upon the colorless corpuscles of\r\nthe blood, lowering their ability to fight disease germs to a marked\r\ndegree. This is well seen in a comparison of deaths from certain infectious\r\ndiseases in drinkers and abstainers, the percentage of mortality being much\r\ngreater in the former.\r\n\r\nDr. T. Alexander MacNichol, in a recent address, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Massart and Bordet, Metchnikoff and Sims Woodhead, have\r\n     proved that alcohol, even in very dilute solution, prevents\r\n     the white blood corpuscles from attacking invading germs,\r\n     thus depriving the system of the cooperation of these\r\n     important defenders, and reducing the powers of resisting\r\n     disease. The experiments of Richardson, Harley, Kales, and\r\n     others have demonstrated the fact that one to five per cent\r\n     of alcohol in the blood of the living human body in a\r\n     notable degree alters the appearance of the corpuscular\r\n     elements, reduces the oxygen bearing elements, and prevents\r\n     their reoxygenation.\"\r\n\r\nAlcohol weakens Resistance to Disease.--In acute illnesses, grippe, fevers,\r\nblood poisoning, etc., substances formed in the blood termed \"antibodies\"\r\nantagonize the action of bacteria, facilitating their destruction by the\r\nwhite blood cells and neutralizing their poisonous influence. In a person\r\nwith good \"resistance\" this protective machinery, which we do not yet\r\nthoroughly understand, works with beautiful precision, and the patient\r\n\"gets well.\" Experiments by scientific experts have demonstrated that\r\nalcohol restrains the formation of these marvelous antibodies. Alcohol puts\r\nto sleep the sentinels that guard your body from disease.\r\n\r\nThe Effect of Alcohol on the Circulation.--Alcoholic drinks affect the very\r\ndelicate adjustment of the nervous center's controlling the blood vessels\r\nand heart. Even very dilute alcohol acts upon the muscles of the tiny blood\r\nvessels; consequently, more blood is allowed to enter them, and, as the\r\nsmall vessels are usually near the surface of the body, the habitual\r\nredness seen in the face of hard drinkers is the ultimate result.\r\n\r\n     \"The first effect of diluted alcohol is to make the heart\r\n     beat faster. This fills the small vessels near the surface.\r\n     A feeling of warmth is produced which causes the drinker to\r\n     feel that he was warmed by the drink. This feeling, however,\r\n     soon passes away, and is succeeded by one of chilliness. The\r\n     body temperature, at first raised by the rather rapid\r\n     oxidation of the alcohol, is soon lowered by the increased\r\n     radiation from the surface.\r\n\r\n     \"The immediate stimulation to the heart's action soon passes\r\n     away and, like other muscles, the muscles of the heart lose\r\n     power and contract with less force after having been excited\r\n     by alcohol.\"--MACY, _Physiology_.\r\n\r\nAlcohol, when brought to act directly on heart muscle, lessens the force of\r\nthe beat. It may even cause changes in the tissues, which eventually result\r\nin the breaking of the walls of a blood vessel or the plugging of a vessel\r\nwith a blood clot. This condition may cause the disease known as\r\n_apoplexy_.\r\n\r\nEffects of Tobacco upon the Circulation.--\"The frequent use of cigars or\r\n     cigarettes by the young seriously affects the quality of the blood.\r\n     The red blood corpuscles are not fully developed and charged with\r\n     their normal supply of life-giving oxygen. This causes paleness of the\r\n     skin, often noticed in the face of the young smoker. Palpitation of\r\n     the heart is also a common result, followed by permanent weakness, so\r\n     that the whole system is enfeebled, and mental vigor is impaired as\r\n     well as physical strength.\"--MACY, _Physiology_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. RESPIRATION AND EXCRETION\r\n\r\n_Problems.--A study of respiration to find out:--\r\n             (a) What changes in blood and air take place within the\r\n               lungs.\r\n             (b) The mechanics of respiration.\r\n            A study of ventilation to discover:--\r\n             (a) The reason for ventilation.\r\n             (b) The best method of ventilation.\r\n            A study of the organs of excretion._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Demonstration._--Comparison of lungs of frog with those of\r\n       bird or mammal.\r\n     _Experiment._--The changes of blood within the lungs.\r\n     _Experiment._--Changes taking place in air in the lungs.\r\n     _Experiment._--The use of the ribs in respiration.\r\n     _Demonstration experiment._--What causes the filling of air\r\n       sacs of the lungs?\r\n     _Demonstration experiment._--What are the best methods of\r\n       ventilating a room?\r\n     _Demonstration._--Best methods of dusting and cleaning.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Beef or sheep's kidney to show areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nNecessity for Respiration.--We have seen that plants and animals need\r\noxygen in order that the life processes may go on. Food is oxidized to\r\nrelease energy, just as coal is burned to give heat to run an engine. As a\r\ndraft of air is required to make fire under the boiler, so, in the human\r\nbody, oxygen must be given so that food in tissues may be oxidized to\r\nrelease energy used in work. This oxidation takes place in the cells of the\r\nbody, be they part of a muscle, a gland, or the brain. _Blood, in its\r\ncirculation to all parts of the body, is the medium which conveys the\r\noxygen to that place in the body where it will be used._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Air passages in the human lungs. _a_, larynx; _b_, trachea\r\n(or windpipe); _c_, _d_, bronchi; _e_, bronchial tubes; _f_, cluster of air\r\ncells.]\r\n\r\nThe Organs of Respiration in Man.--We have alluded to the fact that the\r\nlungs are the organs which give oxygen to the blood and take from it carbon\r\ndioxide. The course of the air passing to the lungs in man is much the same\r\nas in the frog. Air passes through the nose, and into the windpipe. This\r\ncartilaginous tube, the top of which may easily be felt as the Adam's apple\r\nof the throat, divides into two _bronchi_. The bronchi within the lungs\r\nbreak up into a great number of smaller tubes, the _bronchial tubes_, which\r\ndivide somewhat like the small branches of a tree. The bronchial tubes,\r\nindeed all the air passages, are lined with ciliated cells. The cilia of\r\nthese cells are constantly in motion, beating with a quick stroke toward\r\nthe outer end of the tube, that is, toward the mouth. Hence any foreign\r\nmaterial will be raised from the throat first by the action of the cilia\r\nand then by coughing or \"clearing the throat.\" The bronchi end in very\r\nminute air sacs, little pouches having elastic walls, into which air is\r\ntaken when we inspire, or take a deep breath. In the walls of these pouches\r\nare numerous capillaries, the ends of arteries which pass from the heart\r\ninto the lung. _It is through the very thin walls of the air sacs that an\r\ninterchange of gases takes place which results in the blood giving up part\r\nof its load of carbon dioxide, and taking up oxygen in its place._ This\r\nexchange appears to be aided by the presence of an enzyme in the lung\r\ntissues. This is another example of the various kinds of work done by the\r\nenzymes of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram to show what the blood loses and gains in one of the\r\nair sacs of the lungs.]\r\n\r\nChanges in the Blood within the Lungs.--Blood, after leaving the lungs, is\r\nmuch brighter red than just before entering them. The change in color is\r\ndue to a taking up of oxygen by the _haemoglobin_ of the red corpuscles.\r\nChanges taking place in blood are obviously the reverse of those which take\r\nplace in air in the lungs. Every hundred cubic centimeters of blood going\r\ninto the lungs contains 8 to 12 c.c. of oxygen, 45 to 50 c.c. of carbon\r\ndioxide, and 1 to 2 c.c. of nitrogen. The same amount of blood passing out\r\nof the lungs contains 20 c.c. of oxygen, 38 c.c. of carbon dioxide, and 1\r\nto 2 c.c. of nitrogen. The water, of which about half a pint is given off\r\ndaily, is mostly lost from the blood.\r\n\r\nChanges in Air in the Lungs.--Air is much warmer after leaving the lungs\r\nthan before it enters them. Breathe on the bulb of a thermometer to prove\r\nthis. Expired air contains a considerable amount of moisture, as may be\r\nproved by breathing on a cold polished surface. This it has taken up in the\r\nair sacs of the lungs. The presence of carbon dioxide in expired air may\r\neasily be detected by the limewater test. Air such as we breathe out of\r\ndoors contains, by volume:--\r\n\r\n  Nitrogen                76.95\r\n  Oxygen                  20.61\r\n  Carbon dioxide            .03\r\n  Argon                    1.00\r\n  Water vapor (average)    1.40\r\n\r\nAir expired from the lungs contains:--\r\n\r\n  Nitrogen                76.95\r\n  Oxygen                  15.67\r\n  Carbon dioxide           4.38\r\n  Water vapor              2\r\n  Argon                    1\r\n\r\nIn other words, there is a loss between 4 and 5 per cent oxygen, and nearly\r\na corresponding gain in carbon dioxide, in expired air. There are also some\r\nother organic substances present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The respiration of cells.]\r\n\r\nCell Respiration.--It has been shown, in the case of very simple animals,\r\nsuch as the _amoeba_, that when oxidation takes place in a cell, work\r\nresults from this oxidation. The oxygen taken into the lungs is not used\r\nthere, but is carried by the blood to such parts of the body as need oxygen\r\nto oxidize food materials in the cells. Since work is done in the cells of\r\nthe body, food and oxygen are therefore required. The quantity of oxygen\r\nused by the body is nearly dependent on the amount of work performed.\r\nOxygen is constantly taken from the blood by tissues in a state of rest and\r\nis used up when the body is at work. This is suggested by the fact that in\r\na given time a man, when working, gives off more oxygen (in carbon dioxide)\r\nthan he takes in during that time.\r\n\r\nWhile work is being done certain wastes are formed in the cell. Carbon\r\ndioxide is given off when carbon is burned. But when proteins are burned,\r\nanother waste product containing nitrogen is formed. This must be passed\r\noff from the cells, as it is a poison. Here again the lymph and blood, the\r\ncommon carriers, take the waste material to points where it may be\r\n_excreted_ or passed out of the body.\r\n\r\nThe Mechanics of Respiration. The Pleura.--The lungs are covered with a\r\nthin elastic membrane, the _pleura_. This forms a bag in which the lungs\r\nare hung. Between the walls of the bag and the lungs is a space filled with\r\nlymph. By this means the lungs are prevented from rubbing against the walls\r\nof the chest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The chest cavity (_a_) at the time of a full breath; (_b_),\r\nafter an expiration. Explain how the cavity for lungs is made larger.]\r\n\r\nBreathing.--In every full breath there are two distinct movements,\r\ninspiration (taking air in) and expiration (forcing air out). In man an\r\ninspiration is produced by the contraction of the muscles between the ribs,\r\ntogether with the contraction of the diaphragm, the muscular wall just\r\nbelow the heart and lungs; this results in pulling down the diaphragm and\r\npulling upward and outward of the ribs, thus making the space within the\r\nchest cavity larger. The lungs, which lie within this cavity, are filled by\r\nthe air rushing into the larger space thus made. That this cavity is larger\r\nthan it was at first may be demonstrated by a glance at the accompanying\r\nfigure. An expiration is simpler than an inspiration, for it requires no\r\nmuscular effort; the muscles relax, the breastbone and ribs sink into\r\nplace, while the diaphragm returns to its original position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apparatus to show the mechanics of breathing.]\r\n\r\nA piece of apparatus which illustrates to a degree the mechanics of\r\nbreathing may be made as follows: Attach a string to the middle of a piece\r\nof sheet rubber. Tie the rubber over the large end of a bell jar. Pass a\r\nglass Y-tube through a rubber stopper. Fasten two small toy balloons to the\r\nbranches of the tube. Close the small end of the jar with the stopper.\r\nAdjust the tube so that the balloons shall hang free in the jar. If now the\r\nrubber sheet is pulled down by means of the string, the air pressure in the\r\njar is reduced and the toy balloons within expand, owing to the air\r\npressure down the tube. When the rubber is allowed to go back to its former\r\nposition, the balloons collapse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram showing the relative amounts of tidal, complemental,\r\nreserve, and residual air. The brace shows the average lung capacity for\r\nthe adult man.]\r\n\r\nRate of Breathing and Amount of Air Breathed.--During quiet breathing, the\r\nrate of inspiration is from fifteen to eighteen times per minute; this rate\r\nlargely depends on the amount of physical work performed. About 30 cubic\r\ninches of air are taken in and expelled during the ordinary quiet\r\nrespiration. The air so breathed is called _tidal air_. In a \"long\" breath,\r\nwe take in about 100 cubic inches in addition to the tidal air. This is\r\ncalled _complemental air_. By means of a forced expiration, it is possible\r\nto expel from 75 to 100 cubic inches more than tidal air; this air is\r\ncalled _reserve air_. What remains in the lungs, amounting to about 100\r\ncubic inches, is called the _residual air_. The value of deep breathing is\r\nseen by a glance at the diagram. It is only by this means that we clear the\r\nlungs of the reserve air with its accompanying load of carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nRespiration under Nervous Control.--The muscular movements which cause an\r\ninspiration are partly under the control of the will, but in part the\r\nmovement is beyond our control. The nerve centers which govern inspiration\r\nare part of the sympathetic nervous system. Anything of an irritating\r\nnature in the trachea or larynx will cause a sudden expiration or cough.\r\nWhen a boy runs, the quickened respiration is due to the fact that oxygen\r\nis used up rapidly and a larger quantity of carbon dioxide is formed. The\r\ncarbon dioxide in the blood stimulates the nervous center which has control\r\nof respiration to greater activity, and quickened inspiration follows.\r\n\r\nNeed of Ventilation.--During the course of a day the lungs lose to the\r\nsurrounding air nearly two pounds of carbon dioxide. This means that about\r\nthree fifths of a cubic foot is given off by each person during an hour.\r\nWhen we are confined for some time in a room, it becomes necessary to get\r\nrid of this carbon dioxide. This can be done only by means of proper\r\nventilation. A considerable amount of moisture is given off from the body,\r\nand this moisture in a crowded room is responsible for much of the\r\ndiscomfort. The air becomes humid and uncomfortable. It has been found that\r\nby keeping the air in motion in such a room (as through the use of electric\r\nfans) much of this discomfort is obviated.\r\n\r\nThe presence of impurities in the air of a room may easily be determined by\r\nits odor. The odor of a poorly ventilated room is due to organic impurities\r\ngiven off with the carbon dioxide. This, fortunately, gives us an index of\r\nthe amount of waste material in the air. Among the factors which take\r\noxygen from the air in a closed room and produce carbon dioxide are burning\r\ngas or oil lamps and stoves, and the presence of a number of people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three ways of ventilating a room. _i_, inlet for air; _o_,\r\noutlet for air. Which is the best method of ventilation? Explain.]\r\n\r\nProper Ventilation.--Ventilation consists in the removal of air that has\r\nbeen used, and the introduction of a fresh supply to take its place. Heated\r\nair rises, carrying with it much of the carbon dioxide and other\r\nimpurities. A good method of ventilation for the home is to place a board\r\ntwo or three inches high between the lower sash and the frame of a window\r\nor to have the window open an inch or so at the top and the bottom. An open\r\nfireplace in a room aids in ventilation because of the constant draft up\r\nthe flue.\r\n\r\nSweeping and Dusting.--It is very easy to demonstrate the amount of dust in\r\nthe air by following the course of a beam of light in a darkened room. We\r\nhave already proved that spores of mold and yeast exist in the air. That\r\nbacteria are also present can be proved by exposing a sterilized gelatin\r\nplate to the air in a schoolroom for a few moments.[47]\r\n\r\n     Footnote 47: Expose two sterilized dishes containing culture\r\n     media; one in a room being swept with a damp broom, and the\r\n     other in a room which is being swept in the usual manner.\r\n     Note the formation of colonies of bacteria in each dish. In\r\n     which dish does the more abundant growth take place?\r\n\r\nMany of the bacteria present in the air are active in causing diseases of\r\nthe respiratory tract, such as diphtheria, membranous croup, and\r\ntuberculosis. Other diseases, as colds, bronchitis (inflammation of the\r\nbronchial tubes), and pneumonia (inflammation of the tiny air sacs of the\r\nlungs), are also caused by bacteria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate culture exposed for five minutes in a school hall\r\nwhere pupils were passing to recitations. Each spot is a colony of bacteria\r\nor mold.]\r\n\r\nDust, with its load of bacteria, will settle on any horizontal surface in a\r\nroom not used for three or four hours. Dusting and sweeping should always\r\nbe done with a damp cloth or broom, otherwise the bacteria are simply\r\nstirred up and sent into the air again. The proper watering of streets\r\nbefore they are swept is also an important factor in health. Much dust is\r\ncomposed largely of dried excreta of animals. Soft-coal smoke does its\r\nshare to add to the impurities of the air, while sewer gas and illuminating\r\ngas are frequently found in sufficient quantities to poison people. Pure\r\nair is, as can be seen, almost an impossibility in a great city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A sleeping porch, an ideal way to get fresh air at night.]\r\n\r\nHow to get Fresh Air.--As we know, green plants give off in the sunlight\r\nconsiderable more oxygen than they use, and they use up carbon dioxide. The\r\nair in the country is naturally purer than in the city, as smoke and\r\nbacteria are not so prevalent there, and the plants in abundance give off\r\noxygen. In the city the night air is purer than day air, because the\r\nfactories have stopped work, the dust has settled, and fewer people are on\r\nthe streets. The old myth of \"night air\" being injurious has long since\r\nbeen exploded, and thousands of people of delicate health, especially those\r\nwho have weak throat or lungs, are regaining health by sleeping out of\r\ndoors or with the windows wide open. The only essential in sleeping out of\r\ndoors or in a room with a low temperature is that the body be kept warm and\r\nthe head be protected from strong drafts by a nightcap or hood. Proper\r\nventilation at _all_ times is one of the greatest factors in good health.\r\n\r\nChange of Air.--Persons in poor health, especially those having\r\ntuberculosis, are often cured by a change of air. This is not always so\r\nmuch due to the composition of the air as to change of occupation, rest,\r\nand good food. Mountain air is dry, and relatively free from dust and\r\nbacteria, and often helps a person having tuberculosis. Air at the seaside\r\nis beneficial for some forms of disease, especially hay fever and bone\r\ntuberculosis. Many sanitariums have been established for this latter\r\ndisease near the ocean, and thousands of lives are being annually saved in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Unfavorable sleeping conditions. Explain why unfavorable.]\r\n\r\nVentilation of Sleeping Rooms.--Sleeping in close rooms is the cause of\r\nmuch illness. Beds ought to be placed so that a constant supply of fresh\r\nair is given without a direct draft. This may often be managed with the use\r\nof screens. Bedroom windows should be thrown open in the morning to allow\r\nfree entrance of the sun and air, bedclothes should be washed frequently,\r\nand sheets and pillow covers often changed. Bedroom furniture should be\r\nsimple, and but little drapery allowed in the room.\r\n\r\nHygienic Habits of Breathing.--Every one ought to accustom himself upon\r\ngoing into the open air to inspire slowly and deeply to the full capacity\r\nof the lungs. A slow expiration should follow. Take care to force the air\r\nout. Breathe through the nose, thus warming the air you inspire before it\r\nenters the lungs and chills the blood. Repeat this exercise several times\r\nevery day. You will thus prevent certain of the air sacs which are not\r\noften used from becoming hardened and permanently closed.\r\n\r\nRelation of Proper Exercise to Health.--We are all aware that exercise in\r\nmoderation has a beneficial effect upon the human organism. The pale face,\r\ndrooping shoulders, and narrow chest of the boy or girl who takes no\r\nregular exercise is too well known. Exercise, besides giving direct use of\r\nthe muscles, increases the work of the heart and lungs, causing deeper\r\nbreathing and giving the heart muscles increased work; it liberates heat\r\nand carbon dioxide from the tissues where the work is taking place, thus\r\nincreasing the respiration of the tissues themselves, and aids mechanically\r\nin the removal of wastes from tissues. It is well known that exercise, when\r\ntaken some little time after eating, has a very beneficial effect upon\r\ndigestion. Exercise and especially games are of immense importance to the\r\nnervous system as a means of rest. The increasing number of playgrounds in\r\nthis country is due to this acknowledged need of exercise, especially for\r\ngrowing children.\r\n\r\nProper exercise should be moderate and varied. Walking in itself is a\r\nvaluable means of exercising certain muscles, so is bicycling, but neither\r\nis ideal as the _only_ form to be used. _Vary_ your exercise so as to bring\r\ndifferent muscles into play, take exercise that will allow free breathing\r\nout of doors if possible, and the natural fatigue which follows will lead\r\nyou to take the rest and sleep that every normal body requires.\r\n\r\nExercise should always be limited by fatigue, which brings with it fatigue\r\npoisons. This is nature's signal when to rest. If one's use of diet and air\r\nis proper, the fatigue point will be much further off than otherwise. One\r\nshould learn to _relax_ when not in activity. The habit produces rest, even\r\nbetween exertions very close together, and enables one to continue to\r\nrepeat those exertions for a much longer time than otherwise. The habit of\r\nlying down when tired is a good one.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Tight Clothing to Correct Breathing.--It is impossible to\r\nbreathe correctly unless the clothing is worn loosely over the chest and\r\nabdomen. Tight corsets and tight belts prevent the walls of the chest and\r\nthe abdomen from pushing outward and interfere with the drawing of air into\r\nthe lungs. They may also result in permanent distortion of parts of the\r\nskeleton directly under the pressure. Other organs of the body cavity, as\r\nthe stomach and intestines, may be forced downward, out of place, and in\r\nconsequence cannot perform their work properly.\r\n\r\nSuffocation and Artificial Respiration.--Suffocation results from the\r\nshutting off of the supply of oxygen from the lungs. It may be brought\r\nabout by an obstruction in the windpipe, by a lack of oxygen in the air,\r\nby inhaling some other gas in quantity, or by drowning. A severe electric\r\nshock may paralyze the nervous centers which control respiration, thus\r\ncausing a kind of suffocation. In the above cases, death often may be\r\nprevented by prompt recourse to artificial respiration. To accomplish\r\nthis, place the patient on his back with the head lower than the body;\r\ngrasp the arms near the elbows and draw them _upward_ and _outward_ until\r\nthey are stretched above the head, on a line with the body. By this means\r\nthe chest cavity is enlarged and an inspiration produced. To produce\r\nan expiration, carry the arms downward, and press them against the chest,\r\nthus forcing the air out of the lungs. This exercise, regularly repeated\r\nevery few seconds, if necessary for hours, has been the source of saving\r\nmany lives.\r\n\r\nCommon Diseases of the Nose and Throat.--Catarrh is a disease to\r\nwhich people with sensitive mucous membrane of the nose and throat are\r\nsubject. It is indicated by the constant secretion of mucus from these\r\nmembranes. Frequent spraying of the nose and throat with some mild\r\nantiseptic solutions is found helpful. Chronic catarrh should be attended\r\nto by a physician. Often we find children breathing entirely through the\r\nmouth, the nose being seemingly stopped up. When this goes on for\r\nsome time the nose and throat should be examined by a physician for\r\n_adenoids_, or growths of soft masses of tissue which fill up the nose cavity,\r\nthus causing a shortage of the air supply for the body. Many a child,\r\nbackward at school, thin and irritable, has been changed to a healthy,\r\nnormal, bright scholar by the removal of adenoids. Sometimes the\r\ntonsils at the back of the mouth cavity may become enlarged, thus shutting\r\noff the air supply and causing the same trouble as we see in a case of\r\nadenoids. The simple removal of the obstacle by a doctor soon cures\r\nthis condition. (See page 395.)\r\n\r\nOrgans of Excretion.--All the life processes which take place in a living\r\nthing result ultimately, in addition to giving off of carbon dioxide, in\r\nthe formation of organic wastes within the body. The retention of these\r\nwastes which contain nitrogen, is harmful to animals. In man, the skin and\r\nkidneys remove this waste from the body, hence they are called the organs\r\nof excretion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longitudinal section through a kidney.]\r\n\r\nThe Human Kidney.--The human kidney is about four inches long, two and one\r\nhalf inches wide, and one inch in thickness. Its color is dark red. If the\r\nstructure of the medulla and cortex (see figure above) is examined under\r\nthe compound microscope, you will find these regions to be composed of a\r\nvast number of tiny branched and twisted tubules. The outer end of each of\r\nthese tubules opens into the _pelvis_, the space within the kidney; the\r\ninner end, in the cortex, forms a tiny closed sac. In each sac, the outer\r\nwall of the tube has grown inward and carried with it a very tiny artery.\r\nThis artery breaks up into a mass of capillaries. These capillaries, in\r\nturn, unite to form a small vein as they leave the little sac. Each of\r\nthese sacs with its contained blood vessels is called a _glomerulus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of kidney circulation, showing a glomerulus and\r\ntubule: _a_, artery bringing blood to part; _b_, capillary bringing blood\r\nto glomerulus; _b'_, vessel continuing with blood to vein; _c_, vein; _t_,\r\ntubule; _G_, glomerulus.]\r\n\r\nWastes given off by the Blood in the Kidney.--In the glomerulus the blood\r\nloses by osmosis, through the very thin walls of the capillaries, first, a\r\nconsiderable amount of water (amounting to nearly three pints daily);\r\nsecond, a nitrogenous waste material known as urea; third, salts and other\r\nwaste organic substances, uric acid among them.\r\n\r\nThese waste products, together with the water containing them, are known as\r\n_urine_. The total amount of nitrogenous waste leaving the body each day is\r\nabout twenty grams. It is passed through the _ureter_ to the _urinary\r\nbladder_; from this reservoir it is passed out of the body, through a tube\r\ncalled the _urethra_. After the blood has passed through the glomeruli of\r\nthe kidneys it is purer than in any other place in the body, because,\r\nbefore coming there, it lost a large part of its burden of carbon dioxide\r\nin the lungs. After leaving the kidney it has lost much of its nitrogenous\r\nwaste. So dependent is the body upon the excretion of its poisonous\r\nmaterial that, in cases where the kidneys do not do their work properly,\r\ndeath may ensue within a few hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of a section of the skin. (Highly magnified.)]\r\n\r\nStructure and Use of Sweat Glands.--If you examine the palm of your hand\r\nwith a lens, you will notice the surface is thrown into little ridges. In\r\nthese ridges may be found a large number of very tiny pits; these are the\r\npores or openings of the sweat-secreting glands. From each opening a little\r\ntube penetrates deep within the epidermis; there, coiling around upon\r\nitself several times, it forms the sweat gland. Close around this coiled\r\ntube are found many capillaries. From the blood in these capillaries, cells\r\nlining the wall of the gland take water, and with it a little carbon\r\ndioxide, urea, and some salts (common salt among others). This forms the\r\nexcretion known as _sweat_. The combined secretions from these glands\r\namount normally to a little over a pint during twenty-four hours. At all\r\ntimes, a small amount of sweat is given off, but this is evaporated or is\r\nabsorbed by the underwear; as this passes off unnoticed, it is called\r\n_insensible perspiration_. In hot weather or after hard manual labor the\r\namount of perspiration is greatly increased.\r\n\r\nRegulation of Heat of the Body.--The bodily temperature of a person engaged\r\nin manual labor will be found to be but little higher than the temperature\r\nof the same person at rest. We know from our previous experiments that heat\r\nis released. Muscles, nearly one half the weight of the body, release about\r\nfive sixths of their energy as heat. At all times they are giving up some\r\nheat. How is it that the bodily temperature does not differ greatly at such\r\ntimes? The temperature of the body is largely regulated by means of the\r\nactivity of the sweat glands. The blood carries much of the heat, liberated\r\nin the various parts of the body by the oxidation of food, to the surface\r\nof the body, where it is lost in the evaporation of sweat. In hot weather\r\nthe blood vessels of the skin are dilated; in cold weather they are made\r\nsmaller by the action of the nervous system. The blood thus loses water in\r\nthe skin, the water evaporates, and we are cooled off. _The object of\r\nincreased perspiration, then, is to remove heat from the body._ With a\r\nlarge amount of blood present in the skin, perspiration is increased; with\r\na small amount, it is diminished. Hence, we have in the skin an automatic\r\nregulator of bodily temperature.\r\n\r\nSweat Glands under Nervous Control.--The sweat glands, like the other\r\nglands in the body, are under the control of the sympathetic nervous\r\nsystem. Frequently the nerves dilate the blood vessels of the skin, thus\r\nhelping the sweat glands to secrete, by giving them more blood.\r\n\r\n     \"Thus regulation is carried out by the nervous system\r\n     determining, on the one hand, the _loss_ by governing the\r\n     supply of blood to the skin and the action of the sweat\r\n     glands; and on the other, the _production_ by diminishing or\r\n     increasing the oxidation of the tissues.\"--FOSTER AND SHORE,\r\n     _Physiology_.\r\n\r\nColds and Fevers.--The regulation of blood passing through the blood\r\nvessels is under control of the nervous system. If this mechanism is\r\ninterfered with in any way, the sweat glands may not do their work,\r\nperspiration may be stopped, and the heat from oxidation held within the\r\nbody. The body temperature goes up, and a fever results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A_, blood vessels in skin normal; _B_, when congested.]\r\n\r\nIf the blood vessels in the skin are suddenly cooled when full of blood,\r\nthey contract and send the blood elsewhere. As a result a congestion or\r\ncold may follow. Colds are, in reality, a congestion of membranes lining\r\ncertain parts of the body, as the nose, throat, windpipe, or lungs.\r\n\r\nWhen suffering from a cold, it is therefore important not to chill the\r\nskin, as a full blood supply should be kept in it and so kept from the seat\r\nof the congestion. For this reason hot baths (which call the blood to the\r\nskin), the avoiding of drafts (which chill the skin), and warm clothing are\r\nuseful factors in the care of colds.\r\n\r\nHygiene of the Skin.--The skin is of importance both as an organ of\r\nexcretion and as a regulator of bodily temperature. The skin of the entire\r\nbody should be bathed frequently so that this function of excretion may be\r\nproperly performed. Pride in one's own appearance forbids a dirty skin. For\r\nthose who can stand it, a cold sponge bath is best. Soap should be used\r\ndaily on parts exposed to dirt. Exercise in the open air is important to\r\nall who desire a good complexion. The body should be kept at an even\r\ntemperature by the use of proper underclothing. Wool, a poor conductor of\r\nheat, should be used in winter, and cotton, which allows of a free escape\r\nof heat, in summer.\r\n\r\nCuts, Bruises, and Burns.--In case the skin is badly broken, it is\r\nnecessary to prevent the entrance and growth of bacteria. This may be done\r\nby washing the wound with weak antiseptic solutions such as 3 per cent\r\n_carbolic acid_, 3 per cent _lysol_, or _peroxide of hydrogen_ (full\r\nstrength). These solutions should be applied immediately. A burn or scald\r\nshould be covered at once with a paste of baking soda, with olive oil, or\r\nwith a mixture of limewater and linseed oil. These tend to lessen the pain\r\nby keeping out the air and reducing the inflammation.\r\n\r\nSummary of Changes in Blood within the Body.--We have already seen that red\r\ncorpuscles in the lungs lose part of their load of carbon dioxide that they\r\nhave taken from the tissues, replacing it with oxygen. This is accompanied\r\nby a change of color from purple (in blood which is poor in oxygen) to that\r\nof bright red (in richly oxygenated blood). Other changes take place in\r\nother parts of the body. In the walls of the food tube, especially in the\r\nsmall intestine, the blood receives its load of fluid food. In the muscles\r\nand other working tissues the blood gives up food and oxygen, receiving\r\ncarbon dioxide and organic waste in return. In the liver, the blood gives\r\nup its sugar, and the worn-out red corpuscles which break down are removed\r\n(as they are in the spleen) from the circulation. In glands, it gives up\r\nmaterials used by the gland cells in their manufacture of secretions. In\r\nthe kidneys, it loses water and nitrogenous wastes (_urea_). In the skin,\r\nit also loses some waste materials, salts, and water.\r\n\r\n     \"The Effect of Alcohol on Body Heat.--It is usually believed\r\n     that 'taking a drink' when cold makes one warmer. But such\r\n     is not the case. In reality alcohol lowers the temperature\r\n     of the body by dilating the blood vessels of the skin. It\r\n     does this by means of its influence on the nervous system.\r\n     It is, therefore, a mistake to drink alcoholic beverages\r\n     when one is extremely cold, because by means of this more\r\n     bodily heat is allowed to escape.\r\n\r\n     \"Because alcohol is quickly oxidized, and because heat is\r\n     produced in the process, it was long believed to be of value\r\n     in maintaining the heat of the body. A different view now\r\n     prevails as the result of much observation and experiment.\r\n     Physiologists show by careful experiments that though the\r\n     temperature of the body rises during digestion of food, it\r\n     is lowered for some hours when alcohol is taken. The flush\r\n     which is felt upon the skin after a drink of wine or spirits\r\n     is due in part to an increase of heat in the body, but also\r\n     to the paralyzing effect of the alcohol upon the capillary\r\n     walls, allowing them to dilate, and so permitting more of\r\n     the warm blood of the interior of the body to reach the\r\n     surface. There it is cooled by radiation, and the general\r\n     temperature is lowered.\"--MACY, _Physiology_.\r\n\r\nEffect of Alcohol on Respiration.--Alcohol tends to congest the membrane of\r\nthe throat and lungs. It does this by paralyzing the nerves which take care\r\nof the tiny blood vessels in the walls of the air tubes and air sacs. The\r\ncapillaries become full of blood, the air spaces are lessened, and\r\nbreathing is interfered with. The use of alcohol is believed by many\r\nphysicians to predispose a person to tuberculosis. Certainly this disease\r\nattacks drinkers more readily than those who do not drink. Alcohol\r\ninterferes with the respiration of the cells because it is oxidized very\r\nquickly within the body as it is quickly absorbed and sent to the cells. So\r\nrapid is this oxidation that it interferes with the oxidation of other\r\nsubstances. Using alcohol has been likened to burning kerosene in a stove;\r\nthe operation is a dangerous one.\r\n\r\nEffects of Tobacco on Respiration.--Tobacco smoke contains the same kind of\r\npoisons as the tobacco, with other irritating substances added. It is\r\nextremely irritating to the throat; it often causes a cough, and renders it\r\nmore liable to inflammation. If the smoke is inhaled more deeply, the\r\nvaporized nicotine is still more readily absorbed and may thus produce\r\ngreater irritation in the bronchi and lungs. Cigarettes are worse than\r\nother forms of tobacco, for they contain the same poisons with others in\r\naddition.\r\n\r\nEffect of Alcohol on the Kidneys.--It is said that alcohol is one of the\r\ngreatest causes of disease in the kidneys. The forms of disease known as\r\n\"fatty degeneration of the kidney\" and \"Bright's disease\" are both\r\nfrequently due to this cause. The kidneys are the most important organs for\r\nthe removal of nitrogenous waste.\r\n\r\nAlcohol unites more easily with oxygen than most other food materials,\r\nhence it takes away oxygen that would otherwise be used in oxidizing these\r\nfoods. Imperfect oxidation of foods causes the development and retention of\r\npoisons in the blood which it becomes the work of the kidneys to remove. If\r\nthe kidneys become overworked, disease will occur. Such disease is likely\r\nto make itself felt as rheumatism or gout, both of which are believed to be\r\ndue to waste products (poisons) in the blood.\r\n\r\nPoisons produced by Alcohol.--When too little oxygen enters the draft of\r\nthe stove, the wood is burned imperfectly, and there are clouds of smoke\r\nand irritating gases. So, if oxygen unites with the alcohol and too little\r\nreaches the cells, instead of carbon dioxide, water, and urea being formed,\r\nthere are other products, some of which are exceedingly poisonous and which\r\nthe kidneys handle with difficulty. The poisons retained in the circulation\r\nnever fail to produce their poisonous effects, as shown by headaches,\r\nclouded brain, pain, and weakness of the body. The word \"intoxication\"\r\nmeans \"in a state of poisoning.\" These poisons gradually accumulate as the\r\nalcohol takes oxygen from the cells. The worst effects come last, when the\r\nbrain is too benumbed to judge fairly of their harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

If we were to carry our comparison further, however, the\r\nsimile ceases. For the engineer runs the engine, while the bodily machine\r\nis self-directive.\r\n\r\nMoreover, most of the acts we perform during a day's work are results of\r\nthe automatic working of this bodily machine. The heart pumps; the blood\r\ncirculates its load of food, oxygen, and wastes; the movements of breathing\r\nare performed; the thousand and one complicated acts that go on every day\r\nwithin the body are _seemingly_ undirected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The central nervous system.]\r\n\r\nAutomatic Activity.--In addition to this, numbers of other of our daily\r\nacts are not thought about. If we are well-regulated body machines, we get\r\nup in the morning, automatically wash, clean our teeth, dress, go to the\r\ntoilet, get our breakfast, walk to school, even perform such complicated\r\nprocesses as that of writing, without _thinking_ about or _directing_ the\r\nmachine. In these respects we have become creatures of habit. Certain acts\r\nwhich once we might have learned consciously, have become automatic.\r\n\r\nBut once at school, if we are really making good in our work in the\r\nclassroom, we begin a higher control of our bodily functions. Automatic\r\ncontrol acts no longer, and sensation is not the only guide--for we now\r\nbegin to make _conscious choice_; we weigh this matter against another,--in\r\nshort, we _think_.\r\n\r\nParts of the Nervous System.--This wonderful self-directive apparatus\r\nplaced within us, which is in part under control of our will, is known as\r\nthe nervous system. In the vertebrate animals, including man, it consists\r\nof two divisions. One includes the brain, spinal cord, the cranial and\r\nspinal nerves, which together make up the _cerebro-spinal nervous system_.\r\nThe other division is called the _sympathetic nervous system_ and has to do\r\nwith those bodily functions which are beyond our control. Every group of\r\ncells in the body that has work to do (excepting the floating cells of the\r\nblood) is directly influenced by these nerves. Our bodily comfort is\r\ndependent upon their directive work. The organs which put us in touch with\r\nour surroundings are naturally at the _surface_ of the body. Small\r\ncollections of nerve cells, called _ganglia_, are found in all parts of the\r\nbody. These nerve centers are connected, to a greater or less degree, with\r\nthe surface of the body by the nerves, which serve as pathways between the\r\nend organs of touch, sight, taste, etc., and the centers in the brain or\r\nspinal cord. Thus sensation is obtained.\r\n\r\nSensations and Reactions.--We have already seen that simpler forms of life\r\nperform certain acts because certain outside forces acting upon them cause\r\nthem to _react_ to the stimulus from without. The one-celled animal\r\nresponds to the presence of food, to heat, to oxygen, to other conditions\r\nin its surroundings. An earthworm is repelled by light, is attracted by\r\nfood. All animals, including man, are put in touch with their surroundings\r\nby what we call the organs of sensation. The senses of man, besides those\r\nwe commonly know as those of sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, are\r\nthose of temperature, pressure, and pain. It is obvious that such organs,\r\nif they are to be of use to an animal, must be at the outside of the body.\r\nThus we find eyes and ears in the head, and taste cells in the mouth, while\r\nother cells in the nose perceive odors, and still others in the skin are\r\nsensitive to heat or cold, pressure or pain.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Strangely enough, we do not see with our eyes or taste\r\nwith our taste cells. These organs receive the sensations, and by means of\r\na complicated system of greatly elongated cell structures, the message is\r\nsent inward, relayed by other elongated cells until the sensory message\r\nreaches an inner station, in the central nervous system. We see and hear\r\nand smell in our brain. Let us next examine the structure of the nerve\r\ncells or _neurons_ part of which serve as pathways for these messages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of a neuron or nerve unit.]\r\n\r\nNeurones.--A nerve cell, like other cells in the body, is a mass of\r\nprotoplasm containing a nucleus. But the body of the nerve cell is usually\r\nrather irregular in shape, and distinguished from most other cells by\r\npossessing several delicate, branched protoplasmic projections called\r\n_dendrites_. One of these processes, the axon, is much longer than the\r\nothers and ends in a muscle or organ of sensation. The axon forms the\r\npathway over which nervous impulses travel to and from the nerve centers.\r\n\r\nA nerve consists of a bundle of such tiny axons, bound together by\r\nconnective tissue. As a nerve ganglia is a center of activity in the\r\nnervous system, so a cell body is a center of activity which may send an\r\nimpulse over this thin strand of protoplasm (the axon) prolonged many\r\nhundreds of thousands of times the length of the cell. Some neurones in the\r\nhuman body, although visible only under the compound microscope, give rise\r\nto axons several feet in length.\r\n\r\nBecause some bundles of axons originate in organs that receive sensations\r\nand send those sensations to the central nervous system, they are called\r\n_sensory nerves_. Other axons originate in the central nervous system and\r\npass outward as nerves producing movement of muscles. These are called\r\n_motor nerves_.\r\n\r\nThe Brain of Man.--In man, the central nervous system consists of a brain\r\nand spinal cord inclosed in a bony case. From the brain, twelve pairs of\r\nnerves are given off; thirty-one pairs more leave the spinal cord. The\r\nbrain has three divisions. The _cerebrum_ makes up the largest part. In\r\nthis respect it differs from the cerebrum of the frog and other\r\nvertebrates. It is divided into two lobes, the _hemispheres_, which are\r\nconnected with each other by a broad band of nerve fibers. The outer\r\nsurface of the cerebrum is thrown into folds or _convolutions_ which give a\r\nlarge surface, the cell bodies of the neurons being found in this part of\r\nthe cerebrum. Holding the cell bodies and fibers in place is a kind of\r\nconnective tissue. The inner part (white in color) is composed largely of\r\nfibers which pass to other parts of the brain and down into the spinal\r\ncord. Under the cerebrum, and dorsal to it, lies the little brain, or\r\n_cerebellum_. The two sides of the cerebellum are connected by a band of\r\nnerve fibers which run around into the lower hindbrain or _medulla_. This\r\nband of fibers is called the _pons_. The medulla is, in structure, part of\r\nthe spinal cord, and is made up largely of fibers running longitudinally.\r\n\r\nThe Sympathetic Nervous System.--Connected with the central nervous system\r\nis that part of the nervous apparatus that controls the muscles of the\r\ndigestive tract and blood vessels, the secretions of gland cells, and all\r\nfunctions which have to do with life processes in the body. This is called\r\nthe sympathetic nervous system.\r\n\r\nFunctions of the Parts of the Central Nervous System of the Frog.--From\r\ncareful study of living frogs, birds, and some mammals we have learned much\r\nof what we know of the functions of the parts of the central nervous system\r\nin man.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that if the entire brain of a frog is destroyed and\r\nseparated from the spinal cord, \"the frog will continue to live, but with a\r\nvery peculiarly modified activity.\" It does not appear to breathe, nor does\r\nit swallow. It will not move or croak, but if acid is placed upon the skin\r\nso as to irritate it, the legs make movements to push away and to clean off\r\nthe irritating substance. The spinal cord is thus shown to be a center for\r\ndefensive movements. If the cerebrum is separated from the rest of the\r\nnervous system, the frog seems to act a little differently from the normal\r\nanimal. It jumps when touched, and swims when placed in water. It will\r\ncroak when stroked, or swallow if food be placed in its mouth. But it\r\nmanifests no hunger or fear, and is in every sense a machine which will\r\nperform certain actions after certain stimulations. Its movements are\r\nautomatic. If now we watch the movements of a frog which has the brain\r\nuninjured in any way, we find that it acts _spontaneously_. It tries to\r\nescape when caught. It feels hungry and seeks food. It is capable of\r\nvoluntary action. It acts like a normal individual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram to show the parts of the brain and action of the\r\ndifferent parts of the brain.]\r\n\r\nFunctions of the Cerebrum.--In general, the functions of the different\r\nparts of the brain in man agree with those functions we have already\r\nobserved in the frog. The cerebrum has to do with conscious activity; that\r\nis, thought. It presides over what we call our thoughts, our will, and our\r\nsensations. A large part of the area of the outer layer of the cerebrum\r\nseems to be given over to some one of the different functions of speech,\r\nhearing, sight, touch, movements of bodily parts. The movement of the\r\nsmallest part of the body appears to have its definite localized center in\r\nthe cerebrum. Experiments have been performed on monkeys, and these,\r\ntogether with observations made on persons who had lost the power of\r\nmovement of certain parts of the body, and who, after death, were found to\r\nhave had diseases localized in certain parts of the cerebrum, have given to\r\nus our knowledge on this subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of the nerve path of a simple reflex action.]\r\n\r\nReflex Actions; their Meaning.--If through disease or for other reasons the\r\ncerebrum does not function, no will power is exerted, nor are intelligent\r\nacts performed. All acts performed in such a state are known as _reflex\r\nactions_. The involuntary brushing of a fly from the face, or the attempt\r\nto move away from the source of annoyance when tickled with a feather, are\r\nexamples of reflexes. In a reflex act, a person does not think before\r\nacting. The nervous impulse comes from the outside to cells that are not in\r\nthe cerebrum. The message is short-circuited back to the surface by motor\r\nnerves, without ever having reached the thinking centers. The nerve cells\r\nwhich take charge of such acts are located in the cerebellum or spinal\r\ncord.\r\n\r\nAutomatic Acts.--Some acts, however, are learned by conscious thought, as\r\nwriting, walking, running, or swimming. Later in life, however, these\r\nactivities become automatic. The actual performance of the action is then\r\ntaken up by the cerebellum, medulla, and spinal ganglia. Thus the thinking\r\nportion of the brain is relieved of part of its work.\r\n\r\nBundles of Habits.--It is surprising how little real thinking we do during\r\na day, for most of our acts are habitual. Habit takes care of our dressing,\r\nour bathing, our care of the body organs, our methods of eating; even our\r\nmovements in walking and the kind of hand we write are matters of habit\r\nforming. We are bundles of habits, be they good ones or bad ones.\r\n\r\nHabit Formation.--The training of the different areas in the cerebrum to do\r\ntheir work well is the object of education. When we learned to write, we\r\nexerted conscious effort in order to make the letters. Now the act of\r\nforming the letters is done without thought. By training, the act has\r\nbecome automatic. In the beginning, a process may take much thought and\r\nmany trials before we are able to complete it. After a little practice, the\r\nsame process may become almost automatic. We have formed a habit. Habits\r\nare really acquired reflex actions. They are the result of nature's method\r\nof training. The conscious part of the brain has trained the cerebellum or\r\nspinal cord to do certain things that, at first, were taken charge of by\r\nthe cerebrum.\r\n\r\nImportance of Forming Right Habits.--Among the habits early to be acquired\r\nare the habits of studying properly, of concentrating the mind, of learning\r\nself-control, and, above all, of contentment. Get the most out of the world\r\nabout you. Remember that the immediate effect in the study of some subjects\r\nin school may not be great, but the cultivation of correct methods of\r\nthinking may be of the greatest importance later in life. The man or woman\r\nwho has learned how to concentrate on a problem, how to weigh all sides\r\nwith an unbiased mind, and then to decide on what they believe to be best\r\nand right are the efficient and happy ones of their generation.\r\n\r\n     \"The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells,\r\n     is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this\r\n     world by habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong\r\n     way. Could the young but realize how soon they will become\r\n     mere walking bundles of habits, they would give more heed to\r\n     their conduct while in the plastic state. We are spinning\r\n     our own fates, good or evil, and never to be undone. Every\r\n     smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its\r\n     never-so-little scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in\r\n     Jefferson's play, excuses himself for every fresh\r\n     dereliction by saying, 'I won't count this time!' Well! he\r\n     may not count it, and a kind Heaven may not count it; but it\r\n     is being counted none the less. Down among his nerve cells\r\n     and fibers the molecules are counting it, registering and\r\n     storing it up to be used against him when the next\r\n     temptation comes. Nothing we ever do is, in strict\r\n     scientific literalness, wiped out. Of course this has its\r\n     good side as well as its bad one. As we become permanent\r\n     drunkards by so many separate drinks, so we become saints in\r\n     the moral, and authorities in the practical and scientific,\r\n     spheres by so many separate acts and hours of work. Let no\r\n     youth have any anxiety about the upshot of his education,\r\n     whatever the line of it may be. If he keep faithfully busy\r\n     each hour of the working day, he may safely leave the final\r\n     result to itself. He can with perfect certainty count on\r\n     waking up some fine morning, to find himself one of the\r\n     competent ones of his generation, in whatever pursuit he may\r\n     have singled out.\"--JAMES, _Psychology_.\r\n\r\nSome Rules for Forming Good Habits.--Professor Horne gives several rules\r\nfor making good or breaking bad habits. They are: \"First, _act on every\r\nopportunity_. Second, _make a strong start_. Third, _allow no exception_.\r\nFourth, _for the bad habit establish a good one_. Fifth, summoning all the\r\nman within, _use effort of will_.\" Why not try these out in forming some\r\ngood habit? You will find them effective.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The effect of fatigue on nerve cells. _a_, healthy brain\r\ncell; _b_, fatigued brain cell.]\r\n\r\nNecessity of Food, Fresh Air, and Rest.--The nerve cells, like all other\r\ncells in the body, are continually wasting away and being rebuilt.\r\nOxidation of food material is more rapid when we do mental work. The cells\r\nof the brain, like muscle cells, are not only capable of fatigue, but show\r\nthis in changes of form and of contents. _Food_ brought to them in the\r\nblood, plenty of _fresh air_, especially when engaged in active brain work,\r\nand _rest_ at proper times, are essential in keeping the nervous system in\r\ncondition. One of the best methods of resting the brain cells is a change\r\nof occupation. Tennis, golf, baseball, and other outdoor sports combine\r\nmuscular exercise with brain activity of a different sort from that of\r\nbusiness or school work. But change of occupation will not rest exhausted\r\nneurones. For this, sleep is necessary. Especially is sleep an important\r\nfactor in the health of the nervous system of growing children.\r\n\r\nNecessity of Sleep.--Most brain cells attain their growth early in life.\r\nChanges occur, however, until some time after the school age. Ten hours of\r\nsleep should be allowed for a child, and at least eight hours for an adult.\r\nAt this time, only, do the brain cells have opportunity to rest and store\r\nfood and energy for their working period.\r\n\r\nSleep is one way in which all cells in the body, and particularly those of\r\nthe nervous system, get their rest. The nervous system, by far the most\r\ndelicate and hardest-worked set of tissues in the body, needs rest more\r\nthan do other tissues, for its work directing the body only ends with sleep\r\nor unconsciousness. The afternoon nap, snatched by the brain worker, gives\r\nhim renewed energy for his evening's work. It is not hard application to a\r\ntask that wearies the brain; it is _continuous_ work without rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE SENSES\r\n\r\nTouch.--In animals having a hard outside covering, such as certain worms,\r\ninsects, and crustaceans, minute hairs, which are sensitive to touch, are\r\nfound growing out from the body covering. At the base of these hairs are\r\nfound neurones which send axons inward to the central nervous system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nerves in the skin: _a_, nerve fiber; _b_, tactile papillae,\r\ncontaining a tactile corpuscle; _c_, papillae containing blood vessels.\r\n(After Benda.)]\r\n\r\nOrgans of Touch.--In man, the nervous mechanism which governs touch is\r\nlocated in the folds of the dermis or in the skin. Special nerve endings,\r\ncalled the _tactile corpuscles_, are found there, each inclosed in a sheath\r\nor capsule of connective tissue. Inside is a complicated nerve ending, and\r\naxons pass inward to the central nervous system. The number of tactile\r\ncorpuscles present in a given area of the skin determines the accuracy and\r\nease with which objects may be known by touch.\r\n\r\nIf you test the different parts of the body, as the back of the hand, the\r\nneck, the skin of the arm, of the back, or the tip of the tongue, with a\r\npair of open dividers, a vast difference in the accuracy with which the two\r\npoints may be distinguished is noticed. On the tip of the tongue, the two\r\npoints need only be separated by 1/24 of an inch to be so distinguished. In\r\nthe small of the back, a distance of 2 inches may be reached before the\r\ndividers feel like two points.\r\n\r\nTemperature, Pressure, Pain.--The feeling of temperature, pressure, and\r\npain is determined by different end organs in the skin. Two kinds of nerve\r\nfibers exist in the skin, which give distinct sensations of heat and cold.\r\nThese nerve endings can be located by careful experimentation. There are\r\nalso areas of nerve endings which are sensitive to pressure, and still\r\nothers, most numerous of all, sensitive to pain.\r\n\r\nTaste Organs.--The surface of the tongue is folded into a number of little\r\nprojections known as papillae. These may be more easily found on your own\r\ntongue if a drop of vinegar is placed on its broad surface. In the folds,\r\nbetween these projections on the top and back part of the tongue, are\r\nlocated the organs of taste. These organs are called _taste buds_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A_, isolated taste bud, from whose upper free end project\r\nthe ends of the taste cells; _B_, supporting or protecting cell; _C_,\r\nsensory cell.]\r\n\r\nEach taste bud consists of a collection of spindle-shaped neurones, each\r\ncell tipped at its outer end with a hairlike projection. These cells send\r\ninward fibers to other cells, the fibers from which ultimately reach the\r\nbrain. The sensory cells are surrounded by a number of projecting cells\r\nwhich are arranged in layers about them. Thus the organ in longitudinal\r\nsection looks somewhat like an onion cut lengthwise.\r\n\r\nHow we Taste.--Four kinds of substances may be distinguished by the sense\r\nof taste. These are sweet, sour, bitter, and salt. Certain taste cells\r\nlocated near the back of the tongue are stimulated only by a bitter taste.\r\nSweet substances are perceived by cells near the tip of the tongue, sour\r\nsubstances along the sides, and salt about equally all over the surface. A\r\nsubstance must be dissolved in fluid in order to be tasted. Many things\r\nwhich we believe we taste are in reality perceived by the sense of smell.\r\nSuch are spicy sauces and flavors of meats and vegetables. This may easily\r\nbe proved by holding the nose and chewing, with closed eyes, several\r\ndifferent substances, such as an apple, an onion, and a raw potato.\r\n\r\nSmell.--The sense of smell is located in the membrane lining the upper\r\npart of the nose. Here are found a large number of rod-shaped cells which\r\nare connected with the brain by means of the olfactory nerve. In order\r\nto perceive odors, it is necessary to have them diffused in the air; hence\r\nwe sniff so as to draw in more air over the olfactory cells.\r\n\r\nThe Organ of Hearing.--The organ of hearing is the ear. The outer\r\near consists of a funnel-like organ composed largely of cartilage which is\r\nof use in collecting sound waves. This part of the ear incloses the auditory\r\ncanal, which is closed at the inner end by a tightly stretched membrane,\r\nthe _tympanic membrane_ or ear drum. The function of the tympanic\r\nmembrane is to receive sound waves, for all sound is caused by\r\nvibrations in the air, these vibrations being transmitted, by the means\r\nof a complicated apparatus found in the middle ear, to the real organ of\r\nhearing located in the inner ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of ear: _E.M._, auditory canal; _Ty.M._, tympanic\r\nmembrane; _Eu._, Eustachian tube; _Ty_, middle ear; _Coc._, _A.S.C._,\r\n_E.S.C._, etc., internal ear.]\r\n\r\nMiddle Ear.--The middle ear in man is a cavity inclosed by the temporal\r\nbone, and separated from the outer ear by the tympanic membrane. A little\r\ntube called the _Eustachian tube_ connects the inner ear with the mouth\r\ncavity. By allowing air to enter from the mouth, the air pressure is\r\nequalized on the ear drum. For this reason, we open the mouth at the time\r\nof a heavy concussion and thus prevent the rupture of the delicate tympanic\r\nmembrane. Placed directly against the tympanic membrane and connecting it\r\nwith the inner ear is a chain of three tiny bones, the smallest bones of\r\nthe body. The outermost is called the _hammer_; the next the _anvil_; the\r\nthird the _stirrup_. All three bones are so called from their resemblances\r\nin shape to the articles for which they are named. These bones are held in\r\nplace by very small muscles which are delicately adjusted so as to tighten\r\nor relax the membranes guarding the middle and inner ear.\r\n\r\nThe Inner Ear.--The inner ear is one of the most complicated, as well as\r\none of the most delicate, organs of the body. Deep within the temporal bone\r\nthere are found two parts, one of which is called, collectively, the\r\n_semicircular canal region_, the other the _cochlea_, or organ of hearing.\r\n\r\nIt has been discovered by experimenting with fish, in which the\r\nsemicircular canal region forms the chief part of the ear, that this region\r\nhas to do with the equilibrium or balancing of the body. We gain in part\r\nour knowledge of our position and movements in space by means of the\r\n_semicircular canals_.\r\n\r\nThat part of the ear which receives sound waves is known as the _cochlea_,\r\nor snail shell, because of its shape. This very complicated organ is lined\r\nwith sensory cells provided with cilia. The cavity of the cochlea is filled\r\nwith a fluid. It is believed that somewhat as a stone thrown into water\r\ncauses ripples to emanate from the spot where it strikes, so sound waves\r\nare transmitted by means of the fluid filling the cavity to the sensory\r\ncells of the cochlea (collectively known as the _organ of Corti_) and\r\nthence to the brain by means of the auditory nerve.\r\n\r\nThe Character of Sound.--When vibrations which are received by the ear\r\nfollow each other at regular intervals, the sound is said to be musical. If\r\nthe vibrations come irregularly, we call the sound a noise. If the\r\nvibrations come slowly, the pitch of the sound is low; if they come\r\nrapidly, the pitch is high. The ear is able to perceive as low as thirty\r\nvibrations per second and as high as almost thirty thousand. The ear can be\r\ntrained to recognize sounds which are unnoticed in untrained ears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longitudinal section through the eye.]\r\n\r\nThe Eye.--The eye or organ of vision is an almost spherical body which fits\r\ninto a socket of bone, the _orbit_. A stalklike structure, the _optic\r\nnerve_, connects the eye with the brain. Free movement is obtained by means\r\nof six little muscles which are attached to the outer coat, the _eyeball_,\r\nand to the bony socket around the eye.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the eyeball is made up of three coats. An outer tough white\r\ncoat, of connective tissue, is called the _sclerotic coat_. Under the\r\nsclerotic coat, in front, the eye bulges outward a little. Here the outer\r\ncoat is continuous with a transparent tough layer called the _cornea_. A\r\nsecond coat, the _choroid_, is supplied with blood vessels and cells which\r\nbear pigments. It is a part of this coat which we see through the cornea as\r\nthe colored part of the eye (the _iris_). In the center of the iris is a\r\nsmall circular hole (the _pupil_). The iris is under the control of\r\nmuscles, and may be adjusted to varying amounts of light, the hole becoming\r\nlarger in dim light, and smaller in bright light. The inmost layer of the\r\neye is called the _retina_. This is, perhaps, the most delicate layer in\r\nthe entire body. Despite the fact that the retina is less than 1/80 of an\r\ninch in thickness, there are several layers of cells in its composition.\r\nThe optic nerve enters the eye from behind and spreads out to form the\r\nsurface of the retina. Its finest fibers are ultimately connected with\r\nnumerous elongated cells which are stimulated by light. The retina is dark\r\npurple in color, this color being caused by a layer of cells next to the\r\nchoroid coat. This accounts for the black appearance of the pupil of the\r\neye, when we look through the pupil into the darkened space within the\r\neyeball. The retina acts as the sensitized plate in the camera, for on it\r\nare received the impressions which are transformed and sent to the brain as\r\nsensations of sight. The eye, like the camera, has a lens. This lens is\r\nformed of transparent, elastic material. It is found directly behind the\r\niris and is attached to the choroid coat by means of delicate ligaments. In\r\nfront of the lens is a small cavity filled with a watery fluid, the\r\n_aqueous humor_, while behind it is the main cavity of the eye, filled with\r\na transparent, almost jellylike, _vitreous humor_. The lens itself is\r\nelastic. This circumstance permits of a change of form and, in consequence,\r\na change of focus upon the retina of the lens. By means of this change in\r\nform, or _accommodation_, we are able to distinguish between near and\r\ndistant objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How far away can you read these letters? Measure the\r\ndistance. Twenty feet is a test for the normal eye.]\r\n\r\nDefects in the Eye.--In some eyes, the lens is in focus for near objects,\r\nbut is not easily focused upon distant objects; such an eye is said to be\r\nnearsighted. Other eyes which do not focus clearly on objects near at hand\r\nare said to be farsighted. Still another eye defect is astigmatism, which\r\ncauses images of lines in a certain direction to be indistinct, while\r\nimages of lines transverse to the former are distinct. Many nervous\r\ntroubles, especially headaches, may be due to eye strain. We should have\r\nour eyes examined from time to time, especially if we are subject to\r\nheadaches.\r\n\r\nThe Alcohol Question.--It is agreed by investigators that in large or\r\ncontinued amounts alcohol has a narcotic effect; that it first dulls or\r\nparalyzes the nerve centers which control our judgment, and later acts upon\r\nthe so-called motor centers, those which control our muscular activities.\r\n\r\nThe reason, then, that a man in the first stages of intoxication talks\r\nrapidly and sometimes wittily, is because the centers of judgment are\r\nparalyzed. This frees the speech centers from control exercised by our\r\njudgment, with the resultant rapid and free flow of speech.\r\n\r\nIn small amounts alcohol is believed by some physiologists to have always\r\nthis same narcotic effect, while other physiologists think that alcohol\r\ndoes stimulate the brain centers, especially the higher centers, to\r\nincreased activity. Some scientific and professional men use alcohol in\r\nsmall amounts for this stimulation and report no seeming harm from the\r\nindulgence. Others, and by far the larger number, agree that this\r\nstimulation from alcohol is only apparent and that even in the smallest\r\namounts alcohol has a narcotic effect.\r\n\r\nThe Paralyzing Effects of Alcohol on the Nervous System.--Alcohol has the\r\neffect of temporarily paralyzing the nerve centers. The first effect is\r\nthat of exhilaration. A man may do more work for a time under the\r\nstimulation of alcohol. This stimulation, however, is of short duration and\r\nis invariably followed by a period of depression and inertia. In this\r\nlatter state, a man will do less work than before. In larger quantities,\r\nalcohol has the effect of completely paralyzing the nerve centers. This is\r\nseen in the case of a man \"dead drunk.\" He falls in a stupor because all of\r\nthe centers governing speech, sight, locomotion, etc., have been\r\ntemporarily paralyzed. If a man takes a very large amount of alcohol, even\r\nthe nerve centers governing respiration and circulation may become\r\npoisoned, and the victim will die.\r\n\r\nEffect on the Organs of Special Sense.--Professor Forel, one of the\r\nforemost European experts on the question of the effect of alcohol on the\r\nnervous system, says: \"Through all parts of nervous activity from the\r\ninnervation of the muscles and the simplest sensation to the highest\r\nactivity of the soul the paralyzing effect of alcohol can be demonstrated.\"\r\nSeveral experimenters of undoubted ability have noted the paralyzing effect\r\nof alcohol even in small doses. By the use of delicate instruments of\r\nprecision, Ridge tested the effect of alcohol on the senses of smell,\r\nvision, and muscular sense of weight. He found that two drams of absolute\r\nalcohol produced a positive decrease in the sensitiveness of the nerves of\r\nfeeling, that so small a quantity as one half dram of absolute alcohol\r\ndiminished the power of vision and the muscular sense of weight. Kraepelin\r\nand Kurz by experiment determined that the acuteness of the special senses\r\nof sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell was diminished by an ounce of\r\nalcohol, the power of vision being lost to one third of its extent and a\r\nsimilar effect being produced on the other special senses. Other\r\ninvestigators have reached like conclusions. There is no doubt but that\r\nalcohol, even in small quantities, renders the organs of sense less\r\nsensitive and therefore less accurate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table to show a comparison of chances of illness and death\r\nin drinkers and non-drinkers. Solid black, drinkers. (From German\r\nsources.)]\r\n\r\nEffect of Alcohol on the Ability to Resist Disease.--Among certain classes\r\nof people the belief exists that alcohol in the form of brandy or some\r\nother drink or in patent medicines, malt tonics, and the like is of great\r\nimportance in building up the body so as to resist disease or to cure it\r\nafter disease has attacked it. Nothing is further from the truth. In\r\nexperiments on a large number of animals, including dogs, rabbits, guinea\r\npigs, fowls, and pigeons, Laitenen, of the University of Helsingsfors,\r\nfound that alcohol, without exception, made these animals more susceptible\r\nto disease than were the controls.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious effects of alcohol is the lowered resistance of the\r\nbody to disease. It has been proved that a much larger proportion of hard\r\ndrinkers die from infectious or contagious diseases than from special\r\ndiseased conditions due to the direct action of alcohol on the organs of\r\nthe body. This lowered resistance is shown in increased liability to\r\ncontract disease and increased severity of the disease. We have already\r\nalluded to the findings of insurance companies with reference to the length\r\nof life--the abstainers from alcohol have a much better chance of a longer\r\nlife and much less likelihood of infection by disease germs.\r\n\r\nUse of Alcohol in the Treatment of Disease.--In the London Temperance\r\nHospital alcohol was prescribed seventy-five times in thirty-three years.\r\nThe death rate in this hospital has been lower than that of most general\r\nhospitals. Sir William Collins, after serving nineteen years as surgeon in\r\nthis hospital, said:--\r\n\r\n     \"In my experience, speaking as a surgeon, the use of alcohol\r\n     is not essential for successful surgery.... At the London\r\n     Temperance Hospital, where alcohol is very rarely\r\n     prescribed, the mortality in amputation cases and in\r\n     operation cases generally is remarkably low. Total\r\n     abstainers are better subjects for operation, and recover\r\n     more rapidly from accidents, than those who habitually take\r\n     stimulants.\"\r\n\r\nIn a paper read at the International Congress on Tuberculosis, in New York,\r\n1906, Dr. Crothers remarked that alcohol as a remedy or a preventive\r\nmedicine in the treatment of tuberculosis is a most dangerous drug, and\r\nthat all preparations of sirups containing spirits increase, rather than\r\ndiminish, the disease.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg says: \"The paralyzing influence of alcohol upon the white cells\r\nof the blood--a fact which is attested by all investigators--is alone\r\nsufficient to condemn the use of this drug in acute or chronic infections\r\nof any sort.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of use of alcohol on memory.]\r\n\r\nThe Effect of Alcohol upon Intellectual Ability.--With regard to the\r\nsupposed quickening of the mental processes Horsley and Sturge, in their\r\nrecent book, _Alcohol and the Human Body_, say:\r\n\r\n     \"Kraepelin found that the simple reaction period, by which\r\n     is meant the time occupied in making a mere response to a\r\n     signal, as, for instance, to the sudden appearance of a\r\n     flag, was, after the ingestion of a small quantity of\r\n     alcohol (1/4 to 1/2 ounce), slightly accelerated; that there\r\n     was, in fact, a slight shortening of the time, as though the\r\n     brain were enabled to operate more quickly than before. But\r\n     he found that after a few minutes, in most cases, a slowing\r\n     of mental action began, becoming more and more marked, and\r\n     enduring as long as the alcohol was in active operation in\r\n     the body, _i.e._ four to five hours.... Kraepelin found that\r\n     it was only more or less automatic work, such as reading\r\n     aloud, which was quickened by alcohol, though even this was\r\n     rendered less trustworthy and accurate.\" Again: \"Kraepelin\r\n     had always shared the popular belief that a small quantity\r\n     of alcohol (one to two teaspoonfuls) had an accelerating\r\n     effect on the activity of his mind, enabling him to perform\r\n     test operations, as the adding and subtracting and learning\r\n     of figures more quickly. But when he came to measure with\r\n     his instruments the exact period and time occupied, he\r\n     found, to his astonishment, that he had accomplished these\r\n     mental operations, not more, but less, quickly than\r\n     before.... Numerous further experiments were carried out in\r\n     order to test this matter, and these proved that _alcohol\r\n     lengthens the time taken to perform complex mental\r\n     processes_, while by a singular illusion the person\r\n     experimented upon imagines that his psychical actions are\r\n     rendered more rapid.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The effect of alcohol upon ability to do mental work.]\r\n\r\n_Attention_--that is, the power of the mind to grasp and consider\r\nimpressions obtained through the senses--is weakened by drink. The ability\r\nof the mind to associate or combine ideas, the faculty involved in sound\r\n_judgment_, showed that when the persons had taken the amounts of alcohol\r\nmentioned, the combinations of ideas or judgments expressed by them were\r\nconfused, foggy, sentimental, and general. When the persons had taken no\r\nalcohol, their judgments were rational, specific, keen, showing closer\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n     \"The words of Professor Helmholtz at the celebration of his\r\n     seventieth birthday are very interesting in this connection.\r\n     He spoke of the ideas flashing up from the depths of the\r\n     unknown soul, that lies at the foundation of every truly\r\n     creative intellectual production, and closed his account of\r\n     their origin with these words: 'The smallest quantity of an\r\n     alcoholic beverage seemed to frighten these ideas\r\n     away.'\"--DR. G. SIMS WOODHEAD, Professor of Pathology,\r\n     Cambridge University, England.\r\n\r\nProfessor Von Bunge (_Textbook of Physiological and Pathological\r\nChemistry_) of Switzerland says that:\r\n\r\n     \"The stimulating action which alcohol appears to exert on\r\n     the brain functions is only a paralytic action. The cerebral\r\n     functions which are first interfered with are _the power of\r\n     clear judgment and reason_. No man ever became witty by aid\r\n     of spirituous drinks. The lively gesticulations and useless\r\n     exertions of intoxicated people are due to paralysis,--the\r\n     restraining influences, which prevent a sober man from\r\n     uselessly expending his strength, being removed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Drink Habit.--The harmful effects of alcohol (aside from the purely\r\nphysiological effect upon the tissues and organs of the body) are most\r\nterribly seen in the formation of the alcohol habit. The first effect of\r\ndrinking alcoholic liquors is that of exhilaration. After the feeling of\r\nexhilaration is gone, for this is a temporary state, the subject feels\r\ndepressed and less able to work than before he took the drink. To overcome\r\nthis feeling, he takes another drink. The result is that before long he\r\nfinds a habit formed from which he cannot escape. With body and mind\r\nweakened, he attempts to break off the habit. But meanwhile his will, too,\r\nhas suffered from overindulgence. He has become a victim of the drink\r\nhabit!\r\n\r\n     \"The capital argument against alcohol, that which must\r\n     eventually condemn its use, is this, that _it takes away all\r\n     the reserved control, the power of mastership, and therefore\r\n     offends against the splendid pride in himself or herself,\r\n     which is fundamental in every man or woman worth\r\n     anything_.\"--DR. JOHN JOHNSON, quoting Walt Whitman.\r\n\r\nSelf-indulgence, be it in gratification of such a simple desire as that for\r\ncandy or the more harmful indulgence in tobacco or alcoholic beverages, is\r\ndangerous--not only in its immediate effects on the tissues and organs, but\r\nin its more far-reaching effects on habit formation. Each one of us is a\r\nbundle of appetites. If we gratify appetites of the wrong kind, we are\r\nsurely laying the foundation for the habit of excess. Self-denial is a good\r\nthing for each of us to practice at one time or another, if for no other\r\npurpose than to be ready to fight temptation when it comes.\r\n\r\nThe Economic Effect of Alcoholic Poisoning.--In the struggle for existence,\r\nit is evident that the man whose intellect is the quickest and keenest,\r\nwhose judgment is most sound, is the man who is most likely to succeed. The\r\nparalyzing effect of alcohol upon the nerve centers must place the drinker\r\nat a disadvantage. In a hundred ways, the drinker sooner or later feels the\r\nhandicap that the habit of drink has imposed upon him. Many corporations,\r\nnotably several of our greatest railroads (the Pennsylvania and the New\r\nYork Central Railroad among them), refuse to employ any but abstainers in\r\npositions of trust. Few persons know the number of railway accidents due to\r\nthe uncertain eye of some engineer who mistook his signal, or the hazy\r\ninactivity of the brain of some train dispatcher who, because of drink,\r\nforgot to send the telegram that was to hold the train from wreck. In\r\nbusiness and in the professions, the story is the same. The abstainer wins\r\nout over the drinking man.\r\n\r\nEffect of Alcohol on Ability to do Work.--In _Physiological Aspects of the\r\nLiquor Problem_, Professor Hodge, formerly of Clark University, describes\r\nmany of his own experiments showing the effect of alcohol on animals. He\r\ntrained four selected puppies to recover a ball thrown across a gymnasium.\r\nTo two of the dogs he gave food mixed with doses of alcohol, while the\r\nothers were fed normally. The ball was thrown 100 feet as rapidly as\r\nrecovered. This was repeated 100 times each day for fourteen successive\r\ndays. Out of 1400 times the dogs to which alcohol had been given brought\r\nback the ball only 478 times, while the others secured it 922 times.\r\n\r\nDr. Parkes experimented with two gangs of men, selected to be as nearly\r\nsimilar as possible, in mowing. He found that with one gang abstaining from\r\nalcoholic drinks and the other not, the abstaining gang could accomplish\r\nmore. On transposing the gangs, the same results were repeatedly obtained.\r\nSimilar results were obtained by Professor Aschaffenburg of Heidelberg\r\nUniversity, who found experimentally that men \"were able to do 15 per cent\r\nless work after taking alcohol.\"\r\n\r\nRecently many experiments along the same lines have been made. In\r\ntypewriting, in typesetting, in bricklaying, or in the highest type of\r\nmental work the result is the same. The quality and quantity of work done\r\non days when alcohol is taken is less than on days when no alcohol is\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Alcohol to Efficiency.--We have already seen that work is\r\nneither so well done nor is as much accomplished by drinkers as by\r\nnon-drinkers.\r\n\r\nA Massachusetts shoe manufacturer told a recent writer on temperance that\r\nin one year his firm lost over $5000 in shoes spoiled by drinking men, and\r\nthat he had himself traced these spoiled shoes to the workmen who, through\r\ntheir use of alcoholic liquors, had thus rendered themselves incapable.\r\nThis is a serious handicap to our modern factory system, and explains why\r\nso many factory towns and cities are strongly favoring a policy of \"No\r\nlicense\" in opposition to the saloons.\r\n\r\n\"It is believed that the largest number of accidents in shops and mills\r\ntakes place on Monday, because the alcohol that is drunk on Sunday takes\r\naway the skill and attentive care of the workman. To prove the truth of\r\nthis opinion, the accidents of the building trades in Zurich were studied\r\nduring a period of six years, with the result shown by this table\":--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shaded, non-alcoholic; black, alcoholic, accidents. (From\r\nTolman, _Hygiene for the Worker_.)]\r\n\r\nAnother relation to efficiency is shown by the following chart. During the\r\nweek the curve of working efficiency is highest on Friday and lowest on\r\nMonday. The number of accidents were also least on Friday and greatest on\r\nMonday. Lastly the assaults were fewest in number on Friday and greatest on\r\nSunday and Monday. The moral is plain. Workingmen are apt to spend their\r\nweek's wages freely on Saturday. Much of this goes into drink, and as a\r\nresult comes crime on Sunday because of the deadened moral and mental\r\ncondition of the drinker, and loss of efficiency on Monday, because of the\r\npoisonous effects of the drug.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Notice that the curve of efficiency is lowest on Monday and\r\nthat crimes and accidents are most frequent on Sunday and Monday. Account\r\nfor this.]\r\n\r\nEffect of Alcohol upon Duration of Life.--Still more serious is the\r\nrelation of alcohol as a direct cause of disease (see table).\r\n\r\nIt is as yet quite impossible, in the United States at least, to tell just\r\nhow many deaths are brought about, directly or indirectly, by alcohol.\r\nEspecially is this true in trying to determine the number of cases of\r\ndeaths from disease promoted by alcohol. In Switzerland provision is made\r\nfor learning these facts, and the records of that country throw some light\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nDr. Rudolph Pfister made a study of the records of the city of Basle for\r\nthe years 1892-1906, finding the percentage of deaths in which alcohol had\r\nbeen reported by the attending physician as one cause of death. He found\r\nthat 18.1 per cent of all deaths of men between 40 and 50 years of age were\r\ncaused, in part at least, by alcohol, and this at what should be the most\r\nactive period in a man's life, the time when he is most needed by his\r\nfamily and community. Taking all ages between 20 and 80, he found that\r\nalcohol was one cause of death in one man in every ten who died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnother study was made by a certain doctor in Sweden, from records of 1082\r\ndeaths occurring in his own practice and the local hospital. No case was\r\ncounted as alcoholic of which there was the slightest doubt. Of deaths of\r\nadult men, 18 in every 100 were due, directly or indirectly, to alcoholism.\r\nIn middle life, between the ages of 40 and 50, 29; and between 50 and 60\r\nyears of age, 25.6 out of every 100 deaths had alcohol as one cause, thus\r\nagreeing with other statistics we have been quoting.--From the\r\n_Metropolitan_, Vol. XXV, Number 11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The proportion of crime due to alcohol is shown in black.]\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Alcohol to Crime.--A recent study of more than 2500\r\nhabitual users of alcohol showed that over 66 per cent had committed crime.\r\nUsually the crimes had been done in saloons or as a result of quarrels\r\nafter drinking. Of another lot of 23,581 criminals questioned, 20,070 said\r\nthat alcohol had led them to commit crime.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Alcohol to Pauperism.--We have already spoken of the Jukes\r\nfamily. These and many other families of a similar sort are more or less\r\ndirectly a burden upon the state. Alcohol is in part at least responsible\r\nfor the condition of such families. Alcohol weakens the efficiency and\r\nmoral courage, and thus leads to begging, pauperism, petty stealing or\r\nworse, and ultimately to life in some public institution. In Massachusetts,\r\nof 3230 inmates of such institutions, 66 per cent were alcoholics.\r\n\r\nThe Relation of Alcohol to Heredity.--Perhaps the gravest side of the\r\nalcohol question lies here. If each one of us had only himself to think of,\r\nthe question of alcohol might not be so serious. But drinkers may hand down\r\nto their unfortunate children tendencies toward drink as well as nervous\r\ndiseases of various sorts; an alcoholic parent may beget children who are\r\nepileptic, neurotic, or even insane.\r\n\r\nIn the State of New York there are at the present time some 30,000 insane\r\npersons in public and private hospitals. It is believed that about one\r\nfifth of them, or 6000 patients, owe their insanity to alcohol used either\r\nby themselves or by their parents. In the asylums of the United States\r\nthere are 150,000 insane people. Taking the same proportions as before,\r\nthere are 30,000 persons in this country whom alcohol has made or has\r\nhelped to make insane. This is the most terrible side of the alcohol\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        REFERENCE READING\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

MAN'S IMPROVEMENT OF HIS ENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\n_Problems.--How may we improve our home conditions of living?_\r\n           _How may we help improve our conditions at school?_\r\n           _How does the city care for the improvement of our environment?_\r\n             _(a) In inspection of buildings, etc._\r\n             _(b) In inspection of food supplies._\r\n             _(c) In inspection of milk._\r\n             _(d) In care of water supplies._\r\n             _(e) In disposal of wastes._\r\n             _(f) In care of public health._\r\n\r\n                      LABORATORY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n     _Home exercise._--How to ventilate my bedroom.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Effect of use of duster and damp cloth\r\n       upon bacteria in schoolroom.\r\n     _Home exercise._--Luncheon dietaries.\r\n     _Home exercise._--Sanitary map of my own block.\r\n     _Demonstration._--The bacterial content of milk of various\r\n       grades and from different sources.\r\n     _Demonstration._--Bacterial content of distilled water, rain\r\n       water, tap water, dilute sewage.\r\n     _Laboratory exercise._--Study of board of health tables to\r\n       plot curves of mortality from certain diseases during\r\n       certain times of year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Purpose of this Chapter.--In the preceding chapters we have traced the\r\nlives of both plants and animals within their own environment. We have seen\r\nthat man, as well as plants and other animals, needs a favorable\r\nenvironment in order to live in comfort and health. It will be the purpose\r\nof the following pages first to show how we as individuals may better our\r\nhome environment, and secondly, to see how we may aid the civic authorities\r\nin the betterment of conditions in the city in which we live.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How I should ventilate my bedroom.]\r\n\r\nHome Conditions.--The Bedroom.--We spend about one third of our total time\r\nin our bedroom. This room, therefore, deserves more than passing attention.\r\nFirst of all, it should have good ventilation. Two windows make an ideal\r\ncondition, especially if the windows receive some sun. Such a condition as\r\nthis is manifestly impossible in a crowded city, where too often the\r\napartment bedrooms open upon narrow and ill-ventilated courts. Until\r\ncomparatively recent time, tenement houses were built so that the bedrooms\r\nhad practically no light or air; now, thanks to good tenement-house laws,\r\nwide airshafts and larger windows are required by statute.\r\n\r\nCare of the Bedroom.--Since sunlight cannot always be obtained for a\r\nbedroom, we must so care for and furnish the room that it will be difficult\r\nfor germs to grow there. Bedroom furniture should be light and easy to\r\nclean, the bedstead of iron, the floors painted or of hardwood. No hangings\r\nshould be allowed at the windows to collect dust, nor should carpets be\r\nallowed for the same reason. Rugs on the floor may easily be removed when\r\ncleaning is done. The furniture and woodwork should be wiped with a damp\r\ncloth every day. Why a _damp_ cloth? In certain tenements in New York City,\r\ntuberculosis is believed to have been spread by people occupying rooms in\r\nwhich a previous tenant has had tuberculosis. A new tenant should insist on\r\na thorough cleaning of the bedrooms and removal of old wall paper before\r\noccupancy.\r\n\r\nSunlight Important.--In choosing a house in the country we would take a\r\nlocation in which the sunlight was abundant. A shaded location might be too\r\ndamp for health. Sunlight should enter at least some of the rooms. In\r\nchoosing an apartment we should have this matter in mind, for, as we know,\r\ngerms cannot long exist in sunlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This map shows how cases of tuberculosis are found recurring\r\nin the same locality and in the same houses year after year. Each black dot\r\nis one case of tuberculosis.]\r\n\r\nHeating.--Houses in the country are often heated by open fires, stoves or\r\nhot-air furnaces, all of which make use of heated currents of air to warm\r\nthe rooms. But in the city apartments, usually pipes conduct steam or hot\r\nwater from a central plant to our rooms. The difficulty with this system is\r\nthat it does not give us fresh air, but warms over the stale air in a room.\r\nSteam causes our rooms to be too warm part of the time, and not warm enough\r\npart of the time. Thus we become overheated and then take cold by becoming\r\nchilled. Steam heat is thus responsible for much sickness.\r\n\r\nLighting.--Lighting our rooms is a matter of much importance. A student\r\nlamp, or shaded incandescent light, should be used for reading. Shades must\r\nbe provided so that the eyes are protected from direct light. Gas is a\r\ndangerous servant, because it contains a very poisonous substance, carbon\r\nmonoxide. \"It is estimated that 14 per cent of the total product of the gas\r\nplant leaks into the streets and houses of the cities supplied.\" This forms\r\nan unseen menace to the health in cities. Gas pipes, and especially gas\r\ncocks, should be watched carefully for escaping gas. Rubber tubing should\r\nnot be used to conduct gas to movable gas lamps, because it becomes worn\r\nand allows gas to escape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: During the summer all food should be protected from flies.\r\nWhy?]\r\n\r\nInsects and Foods.--In the summer our houses should be provided with\r\nscreens. All food should be carefully protected from flies. Dirty dishes,\r\nscraps of food, and such garbage should be quickly cleaned up and disposed\r\nof after a meal. Insect powder (pyrethrum) will help keep out \"croton bugs\"\r\nand other undesirable household pests, but cleanliness will do far more.\r\nMost kitchen pests, as the roach, simply stay with us because they find\r\ndirt and food abundant.\r\n\r\nUse of Ice.--Food should be properly cared for at all times, but especially\r\nduring the summer. Iceboxes are a necessity, especially where children\r\nlive, in order to keep milk fresh. A dirty icebox is almost as bad as none\r\nat all, because food will decay or take on unpleasant odors from other\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The wrong and the right kind of garbage cans.]\r\n\r\nDisposal of Wastes.--In city houses the disposal of human wastes is\r\nprovided for by a city system of sewers. The wastes from the kitchen, the\r\ngarbage, should be disposed of each day. The garbage pail should be\r\nfrequently sterilized by rinsing it with boiling water. Plenty of lye or\r\nsoap should be used. Remember that flies frequent the uncovered garbage\r\npail, and that they may next walk on your food. Collection and disposal of\r\ngarbage is the work of the municipality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The culture (_A_) was exposed to the air of a dirty street\r\nin the crowded part of Manhattan. (_B_) was exposed to the air of a\r\nwell-cleaned and watered street in the uptown residence portion. Which\r\nculture has the more colonies of bacteria? How do you account for this?]\r\n\r\nSchool Surroundings.--How to Improve Them.--From five to six hours a day\r\nfor forty weeks is spent by the average boy or girl in the schoolroom. It\r\nis part of our environment and should therefore be considered as worthy of\r\nour care. Not only should a schoolroom be attractive, but it should be\r\nclean and sanitary. City schools, because of their locations, of the\r\nsometimes poor janitorial service, and especially because of the\r\nselfishness and carelessness of children who use them, may be very dirty\r\nand unsanitary. Dirt and dust breed and carry bacteria. Plate cultures show\r\ngreatly increased numbers of bacteria to be in the air when pupils are\r\nmoving about, for then dust, bearing bacteria, is stirred up and circulated\r\nthrough the air. Sweeping and dusting with dry brooms or feather dusters\r\nonly stirs up the dust, leaving it to settle in some other place with its\r\nload of bacteria. Professor Hodge tells of an experience in a school in\r\nWorcester, Mass. A health brigade was formed among the children, whose duty\r\nwas to clean the rooms every morning by wiping all exposed surface with a\r\ndamp cloth. In a school of 425 pupils not a single case of contagious\r\ndiseases appeared during the entire year. Why not try this in your own\r\nschool?\r\n\r\nUnselfishness the Motto.--Pupils should be unselfish in the care of a\r\nschool building. Papers and scraps dropped by some careless boy or girl\r\nmake unpleasant the surroundings for hundreds of others. Chalk thrown by\r\nsome mischievous boy and then tramped underfoot may irritate the lungs of a\r\nhundred innocent schoolmates. Colds or worse diseases may be spread through\r\nthe filthy habits of some boys who spit in the halls or on the stairways.\r\n\r\nLunch Time and Lunches.--If you bring your own lunch to school, it should\r\nbe clean, tasty, and well balanced as a ration. In most large schools\r\nwell-managed lunch rooms are part of the school equipment, and balanced\r\nlunches can be obtained at low cost. Do not make a lunch entirely from cold\r\nfood, if hot can be obtained. Do not eat only sweets. Ice cream is a good\r\nfood, if taken with something else, but be sure of your ice cream. \"Hokey\r\npokey\" cream, tested in a New York school laboratory, showed the presence\r\nof many more colonies of bacteria than _good_ milk would show. Above all,\r\nbe sure the food you buy is clean. Stands on the street, exposed to dust\r\nand germs, often sell food far from fit for human consumption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A sensible lunch box, sanitary and compact.]\r\n\r\nIf you eat your lunch on the street near your school, remember not to\r\nscatter refuse. Paper, bits of lunch, and the like scattered on the streets\r\naround your school show lack of school spirit and lack of civic pride. Let\r\nus learn above all other things to be good citizens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dust exhausts on grinding wheels protect lungs of the\r\nworkmen.]\r\n\r\nInspection of Factories, Public Buildings, etc.--It is the duty of a city\r\nto inspect the condition of all public buildings and especially of\r\nfactories. Inspection should include, first, the supervision of the work\r\nundertaken. Certain trades where grit, dirt, or poison fumes are given off\r\nare dangerous to human health, hence care for the workers becomes a\r\nnecessity. Factories should also be inspected as to cleanliness, the amount\r\nof air space per person employed, ventilation, toilet facilities, and\r\nproper fire protection. Tenement inspection should be thorough and should\r\naim to provide safe and sanitary homes.\r\n\r\nInspection of Food Supplies.--In a city certain regulations for the care of\r\npublic supplies are necessary. Foods, both fresh and preserved, must be\r\ninspected and rendered safe for the thousands of people who are to use\r\nthem. All raw foods exposed on stands should be covered so as to prevent\r\ninsects or dust laden with bacteria from coming in contact with them. Meats\r\nmust be inspected for diseases, such as tuberculosis in beef, or\r\ntrichinosis in pork. Cold storage plants must be inspected to prevent the\r\nkeeping of food until it becomes unfit for use. Inspection of sanitary\r\nconditions of factories where products are canned, or bakeries where foods\r\nare prepared, must be part of the work of a city in caring for its\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nCare of Raw Foods.--Each one of us may cooperate with the city government\r\nby remembering that fruits and vegetables can be carriers of disease,\r\nespecially if they are sold from exposed stalls or carts and handled by the\r\npassers-by. All vegetables, fruits, or raw foods should be carefully washed\r\nbefore using. Spoiled or overripe fruit, as well as meat which is decayed,\r\nis swarming with bacteria and should not be used.\r\n\r\nAn interesting exercise would be the inspection of conditions in your own\r\nhome block. Make a map showing the houses on the block. Locate all stores,\r\nsaloons, factories, etc. Notice any cases of contagious disease, marking\r\nthis fact on the map. Mark all heaps of refuse in the street, all uncovered\r\ngarbage pails, any street stands that sell uncovered fruit, and any stores\r\nwith an excessive number of flies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to food inspection, two very important supplies must be\r\nrendered safe by a city for its citizens. These are milk and water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clean cows in clean barns with clean milkers and clean milk\r\npails means clean milk in the city.]\r\n\r\nCare in Production of Milk.--Milk when drawn from a healthy cow should be\r\nfree from bacteria. But immediately on reaching the air it may receive\r\nbacteria from the air, from the hands of the person who milks the cows,\r\nfrom the pail, or from the cow herself. Cows should, therefore, be milked\r\nin surroundings that are sanitary, the milkers should wear clean garments,\r\nput on over their ordinary clothes at milking time, while pails and all\r\nutensils used should be kept clean. Especially the surface exposed on the\r\nudder from which the milk is drawn should be cleansed before milking.\r\n\r\nMost large cities now send inspectors to the farms from which milk is\r\nsupplied. Farms that do not accept certain standards of cleanliness are not\r\nallowed to have their milk become part of the city supply.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis and Milk.--It is recognized that in some European countries\r\nfrom 30 to 40 per cent of all cattle have tuberculosis. Many dairy herds in\r\nthis country are also infected. It is also known that the tubercle bacillus\r\nof cattle and man are much alike in form and action and that _probably_ the\r\ngerm from cattle would cause tuberculosis in man. Fortunately, the\r\ntuberculosis germ does not _grow_ in milk, so that even if milk from\r\ntubercular cattle should get into our supply, it would be diluted with the\r\nmilk of healthy cattle. In order to protect our milk supply from these\r\ngerms it would be necessary to kill all tubercular cattle (almost an\r\nimpossibility) or to pasteurize our milk so as to kill the germs in it.\r\n\r\nOther Disease Germs in Milk.--We have already shown how typhoid may be\r\nspread through milk. Usually such outbreaks may be traced to a single case\r\nof typhoid, often a person who is a \"typhoid carrier,\" _i.e._ one who may\r\nnot suffer from the effects of the disease, but who carries the germs in\r\nhis body, spreading them by contact. A recent epidemic of typhoid in New\r\nYork City was traced to a single typhoid carrier on a farm far from the\r\ncity. Sometimes the milk cans may be washed in contaminated water or the\r\ncows may even get the germs on their udders by wading in a polluted stream.\r\nDiphtheria, scarlet fever, and Asiatic cholera are also undoubtedly spread\r\nthrough milk supplies. Milk also plays a very important part in the high\r\ndeath rate from diarrhoeal diseases among young children in warm weather.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A diagram to show how typhoid may be spread in a city\r\nthrough an infected milk supply. The black spots in the blocks mean cases\r\nof typhoid. _A_, a farm where typhoid exists; the dashes in the streets\r\nrepresent the milk route. _B_ is a second farm which sends part of its milk\r\nto _A_; the milk cans from _B_ are washed at farm _A_ and sent back to _B_.\r\nA few cases of typhoid appear along _B_'s milk route. How do you account\r\nfor that?]\r\n\r\nGrades of Milk in a City Supply.--Milk which comes to a city may be roughly\r\nplaced in three different classes. The best milk, coming from farms where\r\nthe highest sanitary standards exist, where the cows are all tubercular\r\ntested, where modern appliances for handling and cooling the milk exist, is\r\nknown as certified or, in New York City, grade A milk. Most of the milk\r\nsold, however, is not so pure nor is so much care taken in handling it.\r\nSuch milk, known in New York as grade B milk, is pasteurized before\r\ndelivery, and is sold only in bottles. A still lower grade of milk (dipped\r\nmilk) is sold direct from cans. It is evident that such milk, often exposed\r\nto dust and other dirt, is unfit for any purpose except for cooking. It\r\nshould under no circumstances be used for children. A regulation recently\r\nmade by the New York City Department of Health states that milk sold\r\n\"loose\" in restaurants, lunch-rooms, soda fountains, and hotels must be\r\npasteurized.\r\n\r\nCare of a City Milk Supply.--Besides caring for milk in its production on\r\nthe farm, proper transportation facilities must be provided. Much of the\r\nmilk used in New York City is forty-eight hours old before it reaches the\r\nconsumer. During shipment it must be kept in refrigerator cars, and during\r\ntransit to customers it should be iced. Why? All but the highest grade milk\r\nshould be pasteurized. Why? Milk should be bottled by machinery if possible\r\nso as to insure no personal contact; it should be kept in clean, cool\r\nplaces; and no milk should be sold by dipping from cans. Why is this a\r\nmethod of dispensing impure milk?\r\n\r\nCare of Milk in the Home.--Finally, milk at home should receive the best of\r\ncare. It should be kept on ice and in covered bottles, because it readily\r\ntakes up the odors of other foods. If we are not certain of its purity or\r\nkeeping qualities, it should be pasteurized at home. Why?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New York City is spending $350,000,000 to have a pure and\r\nabundant water supply. This is the tunnel which will bring the water from\r\nthe Catskill Mountains to New York City.]\r\n\r\nWater Supplies.--One of the greatest assets to the health of a large city\r\nis pure water. By pure water we mean water free from all _organic_\r\nimpurities, including germs. Water from springs and deep driven wells is\r\nthe safest water, that from large reservoirs next best, while water that\r\nhas drainage in it, river water for example, is very unsafe.\r\n\r\nThe waters from deep wells or springs if properly protected will contain no\r\nbacteria. Water taken from protected streams into which no sewage flows\r\nwill have but few bacteria, and these will be destroyed if exposed to the\r\naction of the sun and the constant aeration (mixing with oxygen) which the\r\nsurface water receives in a large lake or reservoir. But water taken from a\r\nriver into which the sewage of other towns and cities flows must be\r\nfiltered before it is fit for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The city of Lowell in 1891 took its water _without\r\nfiltering_, _i.e._ from the Merrimack River at the point shown on the map.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever broke out in North Chelmsford and about two weeks later cases\r\nbegan to appear in Lowell until a great epidemic occurred. Explain this\r\noutbreak. Each black dot is a case of typhoid.]\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever germs live in the food tube, hence the excreta of a typhoid\r\npatient will contain large numbers of germs. In a city with a system of\r\nsewage such germs might eventually pass from the sewers into a river. Many\r\ncities take their water supply directly from rivers, sometimes not far\r\nbelow another large town. Such cities must take many germs into their water\r\nsupply. Many cities, as Cleveland and Buffalo, take their water from lakes\r\ninto which their sewage flows. Others, as Albany, Pittsburgh, and\r\nPhiladelphia, take their drinking water directly from rivers into which\r\nsewage from cities above them on the river has flowed. Filtering such water\r\nby means of passing the water through settling basins and sand filters\r\nremoves about 98 per cent of the germs. The result of drinking unfiltered\r\nand filtered water in certain large cities is shown graphically at right.\r\nIn cities which drain their sewage into rivers and lakes, the question of\r\nsewage disposal is a large one, and many cities now have means of disposing\r\nof their sewage in some manner as to render it harmless to their neighbors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Filter beds at Albany, N. Y.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cases of typhoid per 100,000 inhabitants before filtering\r\nwater supply (solid) and after (shaded) in _A_, Watertown, N. Y.; _B_,\r\nAlbany, N. Y.; _C_, Lawrence, Mass.; D, Cincinnati, Ohio. What is the\r\neffect of filtering the water supply?]\r\n\r\nRailroads are often responsible for carrying typhoid and spreading it. It\r\nis said that a recent outbreak of typhoid in Scranton, Pa., was due to the\r\nfact that the excreta from a typhoid patient traveling in a sleeping car\r\nwas washed by rain into a reservoir near which the train was passing.\r\nRailroads are thus seen to be great open sewers. A sanitary car toilet is\r\nthe only remedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This chart shows that during a cholera epidemic in 1892\r\nthere were hundreds of cases of cholera in Hamburg, which used unfiltered\r\nwater from the Elbe, but in adjoining Altona, where filtered water was\r\nused, the cases were very few.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stone filter beds in a sewage disposal plant.]\r\n\r\nSewage Disposal.--Sewage disposal is an important sanitary problem for any\r\ncity. Some cities, like New York, pour their sewage directly into rivers\r\nwhich flow into the ocean. Consequently much of the liquid which bathes the\r\nshores of Manhattan Island is dilute sewage. Other cities, like Buffalo or\r\nCleveland, send their sewage into the lakes from which they obtain their\r\nsupply of drinking water. Still other cities which are on rivers are forced\r\nto dispose of their sewage in various ways. Some have a system of filter\r\nbeds in which the solid wastes are acted upon by the bacteria of decay, so\r\nthat they can be collected and used as fertilizer. Others precipitate or\r\ncondense the solid materials in the sewage and then dispose of it. Another\r\nmethod is to flow the sewage over large areas of land, later using this\r\nland for the cultivation of crops. This method is used by many small\r\nEuropean cities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Collecting ashes.]\r\n\r\nThe Work of the Department of Street Cleaning.--In any city a menace to the\r\nhealth of its citizens exists in the refuse and garbage. The city streets,\r\nwhen dirty, contain countless millions of germs which have come from\r\ndecaying material, or from people ill with disease. In most large cities a\r\ndepartment of street cleaning not only cares for the removal of dust from\r\nthe streets, but also has the removal of garbage, ashes, and other waste as\r\na part of its work. The disposal of solid wastes is a tremendous task. In\r\nManhattan the dry wastes are estimated to be 1,000,000 tons a year in\r\naddition to about 175,000 tons of garbage. Prior to 1895 in the city of New\r\nYork garbage was not separated from ashes; now the law requires that\r\ngarbage be placed in separate receptacles from ashes. Do you see why? The\r\nstreet-cleaning department should be aided by every citizen; rules for the\r\nseparation of garbage, papers, and ashes should be kept. Garbage and ash\r\ncans should be _covered_. The practice of upsetting ash or garbage cans is\r\none which no young citizen should allow in his neighborhood, for sanitary\r\nreasons. The best results in summer street cleaning are obtained by washing\r\nor flushing the streets, for thus the dirt containing germs is prevented\r\nfrom getting into the air. The garbage is removed in carts, and part of it\r\nis burned in huge furnaces. The animal and plant refuse is cooked in great\r\ntanks; from this material the fats are extracted, and the solid matter is\r\nsold for fertilizer. Ashes are used for filling marsh land. Thus the\r\nremoval of waste matter may pay for itself in a large city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The upper picture shows the stables where millions of flies\r\nwere bred; the lower picture, the disinfection of manure so as to prevent\r\nthe breeding of flies.]\r\n\r\nAn Experiment in Civic Hygiene.--During the summer of 1913 an interesting\r\nexperiment on the relation of flies and filth to disease was carried on in\r\nNew York City by the Bureau of Public Health and Hygiene of the New York\r\nAssociation for improving the condition of the poor. Two adjoining blocks\r\nwere chosen in a thickly populated part of the Bronx near a number of\r\nstables which were the sources of great numbers of flies. In one block all\r\nhouses were screened, garbage pails were furnished with covers, refuse was\r\nremoved and the surroundings made as sanitary as possible. In the adjoining\r\nblock conditions were left unchanged. During the summer as flies began to\r\nbreed in the manure heaps near the stables all manure was disinfected. Thus\r\nthe breeding of flies was checked. The campaign of education was continued\r\nduring the summer by means of moving pictures, nurses, boy scouts, and\r\nschool children who became interested.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the summer it was found that there had been a considerable\r\ndecrease in the number of cases of fly-carried diseases and a still greater\r\ndecrease in the total days of sickness (especially of children) in the\r\nscreened and sanitary block. The table and pictures speak for themselves.\r\nIf such a small experiment shows results like this, then what might a\r\ngeneral clean-up of a city show?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the upper picture a little girl can be seen dumping\r\ngarbage from the fire escape. She was a foreigner and knew no better. The\r\npicture below shows the result of such garbage disposal.]\r\n\r\nPublic Hygiene.--Although it is absolutely necessary for each individual to\r\nobey the laws of health if he or she wishes to keep well, it has also\r\nbecome necessary, especially in large cities, to have general supervision\r\nover the health of people living in a community. This is done by means of a\r\ndepartment or board of health. It is the function of this department to\r\ncare for public health. In addition to such a body in cities, supervision\r\nover the health of its citizens is also exercised by state boards of\r\nhealth. But as yet the government of the United States has not established\r\na Bureau of Health, important as such a bureau would be.\r\n\r\nThe Functions of a City Board of Health.--The administration of the Board\r\nof Health in New York City includes a number of divisions, each of which\r\nhas a different work to do. Each is in itself important, and, working\r\ntogether, the entire machine provides ways and means for making the great\r\ncity a safe and sanitary place in which to live. Let us take up the work of\r\neach division of the health board in order to find out how we may cooperate\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Comparison of cases of illness during the summer of 1913 in\r\ntwo city blocks, one clean and the other dirty. What are your conclusions?]\r\n\r\nThe Division of Infectious Diseases.--Infectious diseases are chiefly\r\nspread through _personal contact_. It is the duty of a government to\r\nprevent a person having such a disease from spreading it broadcast among\r\nhis neighbors. This can be done by _quarantine_ or _isolation_ of the\r\nperson having the disease. So the board of health at once isolates any case\r\nof disease which may be communicated from one person to another. No one\r\nsave the doctor or nurse should enter the room of the person quarantined.\r\nAfter the disease has run its course, the clothing, bedding, etc., in the\r\nsick room is fumigated. This is usually done by the board of health.\r\nFormaldehyde in the form of candles for burning or in a liquid form is a\r\ngood disinfectant. In disinfecting the room should be tightly closed to\r\nprevent the escape of the gas used, as the object of the disinfection is to\r\nkill all the disease germs left in the room. In some cases of infectious\r\ndisease, as scarlet fever, it is found best to isolate the patients in a\r\nhospital used for that purpose. Examples of the most infectious diseases\r\nare measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and diphtheria.\r\n\r\nImmunity.--In the prevention of germ diseases we must fight the germ by\r\nattacking the parasites directly with poisons that will kill them (such\r\npoisons are called _germicides_ or _disinfectants_), and we must strive to\r\nmake the persons coming in contact with the disease unlikely to take it.\r\nThis insusceptibility or _immunity_ may be either natural or acquired.\r\nNatural immunity seems to be in the constitution of a person, and may be\r\ninherited. Immunity may be acquired by means of such treatment as the\r\nantitoxin treatment for diphtheria. This treatment, as the name denotes, is\r\na method of neutralizing the poison (toxin) caused by the bacteria in the\r\nsystem. It was discovered a few years ago by a German, Von Behring, that\r\nthe serum of the blood of an animal immune to diphtheria is capable of\r\nneutralizing the poison produced by the diphtheria-causing bacteria. Horses\r\nare rendered immune by giving them the diphtheria toxin in gradually\r\nincreasing doses. The serum of the blood of these horses is then used to\r\ninoculate the patient suffering from or exposed to diphtheria, and thus the\r\ndisease is checked or prevented altogether by the antitoxin injected into\r\nthe blood. The laboratories of the board of health prepare this antitoxin\r\nand supply it fresh for public use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Antitoxin for diphtheria prepared by the New York Board of\r\nHealth.]\r\n\r\nIt has been found from experience in hospitals that deaths from diphtheria\r\nare largely preventable by _early use_ of antitoxin. When antitoxin was\r\nused on the first day of the disease no deaths took place. If not used\r\nuntil the second day, 5 deaths occurred in every hundred cases, on the\r\nthird day 11 deaths, on the 4th day 19 deaths, and on the 5th day 20 deaths\r\nout of every hundred cases. It is therefore advisable, in a suspected case\r\nof diphtheria, to have antitoxin used at once to prevent serious results.\r\n\r\nVaccination.--Smallpox was once the most feared disease in this country; 95\r\nper cent of all people suffered from it. As late as 1898, over 50,000\r\npersons lost their lives annually in Russia from this disease. It is\r\nprobably not caused by bacteria, but by a tiny animal parasite. Smallpox\r\nhas been brought under absolute control by vaccination,--the inoculation of\r\nman with the substance (called _virus_) which causes cowpox in a cow.\r\nCowpox is like a mild form of smallpox, and the introduction of this virus\r\ngives complete immunity to smallpox for several years after vaccination.\r\nThis immunity is caused by the formation of a germicidal substance in the\r\nblood, due to the introduction of the virus. Another function of the board\r\nof health is the preparation and distribution of vaccine (material\r\ncontaining the virus of cowpox).\r\n\r\nRabies (Hydrophobia).--This disease, which is believed to be caused by a\r\nprotozoan parasite, is communicated from one dog to another in the saliva\r\nby biting. In a similar manner it is transferred to man. The great French\r\nbacteriologist, Louis Pasteur, discovered a method of treating this disease\r\nso that when taken early at the time of the entry of the germ into the body\r\nof man, the disease can be prevented. In some large cities (among them New\r\nYork) the board of health has established a laboratory where free treatment\r\nis given to all persons bitten by dogs suspected of having rabies.\r\n\r\nVaccination against Typhoid.--Typhoid fever has within the past five years\r\nreceived a new check from vaccination which has been introduced into our\r\narmy and which is being used with good effect by the health departments of\r\nseveral large cities.\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the differences between number of cases and\r\nmortality in the army in 1898 during the war with Spain and in 1911 during\r\nthe concentration of certain of our troops at San Antonio, Texas.\r\n\r\n  1898--2nd Division, 7th Army Corps, Jacksonville, Florida.\r\n                    June-October, 1898\r\n\r\n  Mean strength, 10,759.\r\n  Cases of typhoid certain and probable, 2693.\r\n  Death from typhoid, 258.\r\n  Death from all diseases, 281.\r\n\r\n  Manoeuver Division, San Antonio, Texas. March 10-July 11, 1911.\r\n\r\n  Mean strength, 12,801.\r\n  Cases of typhoid, 1.\r\n  Death from typhoid, 0.\r\n  Deaths all diseases, 11.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Comparison of cases of and death from typhoid in 1898 and\r\n1911. What have we learned about combating typhoid since 1898?]\r\n\r\nDuring this period there were 49 cases of typhoid and 19 deaths in the\r\nnear-by city of San Antonio. But in camp, _where vaccination for typhoid\r\nwas required_, all were practically immune. In the army at large, since\r\ntyphoid vaccination has been practiced, 1908-1909, the death rate from\r\ntyphoid has dropped from 2.9 per 1000 to .03 per 1000, a wonderful record\r\nwhen we remember that during the Spanish-American War 86 per cent of the\r\ndeaths in the army were from typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The best cures for tuberculosis are rest, plenty of fresh\r\nout-of-door air, and wholesome food.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A sanitarium for tuberculosis. Notice the outdoor sleeping\r\nrooms.]\r\n\r\nHow the Board of Health fights Tuberculosis.--Tuberculosis, which a few\r\nyears ago killed fully one seventh of the people who died from disease in\r\nthis country, now kills less than one tenth. This decrease has been largely\r\nbrought about because of the treatment of the disease. Since it has been\r\nproved that tuberculosis if taken early enough is curable, by quiet living,\r\ngood food, and _plenty_ of fresh air and light, we find that numerous\r\nsanitaria have come into existence which are supported by private or public\r\nmeans. At these sanitaria the patients _live_ out of doors, especially\r\nsleep in the air, while they have plenty of nourishing food and little\r\nexercise. The department of health of New York City maintains a sanitarium\r\nat Otisville in the Catskill Mountains. Here people who are unable to\r\nprovide means for getting away from the city are cared for at the city's\r\nexpense and a large percentage of them are cured. In this way and by\r\ntenement house laws which require proper air shafts and window ventilation\r\nin dwellings, by laws against spitting in public places, and in other ways,\r\nthe boards of health in our towns and cities are waging war on\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nEx-President Roosevelt said, in one of his latest messages to Congress:--\r\n\r\n     \"There are about 3,000,000 people seriously ill in the\r\n     United States, of whom 500,000 are consumptives. _More than\r\n     half of this illness is preventable._ If we count the value\r\n     of each life lost at only $1700 and reckon the average\r\n     earning lost by illness at $700 a year for grown men, we\r\n     find that the economic gain from mitigation of preventable\r\n     disease in the United States would exceed $1,500,000,000 a\r\n     year. This gain can be had through medical investigation and\r\n     practice, school and factory hygiene, restriction of labor\r\n     by women and children, the education of the people in both\r\n     public and private hygiene, and through improving the\r\n     efficiency of our health service, municipal, state, and\r\n     national.\"\r\n\r\nWork of the Division of School and Infant Hygiene.--Besides the work of the\r\ndivision of infectious disease, the division of sanitation, which regulates\r\nthe general sanitary conditions of houses and their surroundings and the\r\ndivision of inspection, which looks after the purity and conditions of sale\r\nand delivery of milk and foods, there is another department which most\r\nvitally concerns school children. This is the division of school and infant\r\nhygiene. The work of this department is that of the care of the children of\r\nthe city. During the year 1912, 279,776 visits were made to the homes of\r\nschool children of the city of New York by inspectors and nurses. Besides\r\nthis, thousands of children in school were cared for and aided by the city.\r\n\r\nAdenoids.--Many children suffer needlessly from adenoids,--growths in the\r\nback of the nose or mouth which prevent sufficient oxygen being admitted to\r\nthe lungs. A child suffering from these growths is known as a \"mouth\r\nbreather\" because the mouth is opened in order to get more air. The result\r\nto the child may be a handicap of deafness, chronic running of the nose,\r\nnervousness, and lack of power to think. His body cells are starving for\r\noxygen. A very simple operation removes this growth. Cooperation on the\r\npart of the children and parents with the doctors or nurses of the board of\r\nhealth will do much in removing this handicap from many young lives.\r\n\r\nEyestrain.--Another handicap to a boy or girl is eyestrain. Twenty-two per\r\ncent of the school children of Massachusetts were recently found to have\r\ndefects in vision. Tests for defective eyesight may be made at school\r\neasily by competent doctors, and if the child or parent takes the advice\r\ngiven to correct this by procuring proper glasses, a handicap on future\r\nsuccess will be removed.\r\n\r\nDecayed Teeth.--Decayed teeth are another handicap, cared for by this\r\ndivision. Free dental clinics have been established in many cities, and if\r\nchildren will do their share, the chances of their success in later life\r\nwill be greatly aided. Boys and girls, if handicapped with poor eyes or\r\nteeth, do not have a fair chance in life's competition. In a certain school\r\nin New York City there were 236 pupils marked \"C\" in their school work.\r\nThese children were examined, and 126 were found to have bad teeth, 54\r\ndefective vision, and 56 other defects, as poor hearing, adenoids, enlarged\r\ntonsils, etc. Of these children 185 were treated for these various\r\ndifficulties, and 51 did not take treatment. During the following year's\r\nwork 176 of these pupils _improved_ from \"C\" to \"B\" or \"A\", while 60 did\r\nnot improve. If defects _are_ such a handicap in school, then what would be\r\nthe chances of success in life outside.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: this department of school hygiene deserves the earnest aid\r\nof every young citizen, girl or boy. If each of us would honestly help by\r\nmaintaining quarantine in the case of contagious disease, by observing the\r\nrules of the health department in fumigation, by acting upon advice given\r\nin case of eyestrain, bad teeth, or adenoids, and most of all by observing\r\nthe rules of personal hygiene as laid down in this book, the city in which\r\nwe live would, a generation hence, contain stronger, more prosperous, and\r\nmore efficient citizens than it does to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         REFERENCE BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            ELEMENTARY\r\n\r\n     Hunter, _Laboratory Problems in Civic Biology_.

SOME GREAT NAMES IN BIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we were to attempt to group the names associated with the study of\r\nbiology, we would find that in a general way they were connected either\r\nwith discoveries of a purely scientific nature or with the benefiting of\r\nman's condition by the _application_ of the purely scientific discoveries.\r\nThe first group are necessary in a science in order that the second group\r\nmay apply their work. It was necessary for men like Charles Darwin or\r\nGregor Mendel to prove their theories before men like Luther Burbank or any\r\nof the men now working in the Department of Agriculture could benefit\r\nmankind by growing new varieties of plants. The discovery of scientific\r\ntruths must be achieved before the men of modern medicine can apply these\r\ngreat truths to the cure or prevention of disease. Since we are most\r\ninterested in discoveries which touch directly upon human life, the men of\r\nwhom this chapter treats will be those who, directly or indirectly, have\r\nbenefited mankind.\r\n\r\nThe Discoverers of Living Matter.--The names of a number of men living at\r\ndifferent periods are associated with our first knowledge of cells. About\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century microscopes came into use. Through\r\ntheir use plant cells were first described and pictured as hollow boxes or\r\n\"cells.\" But it was not until 1838 that two German friends, Schleiden and\r\nSchwann by name, working on plants and animals, discovered that both of\r\nthese forms of life contained a jellylike substance that later came to be\r\ncalled _protoplasm_. Another German named Max Schultz in 1861 gave the name\r\nprotoplasm to _all living matter_, and a little later still Professor\r\nHuxley, a famous Englishman, friend and champion of Charles Darwin, called\r\nattention to the physical and chemical qualities of protoplasm so that it\r\ncame to be known as the chemical and physical basis of life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prof. Tyndall's experiment to show that if air containing\r\ngerms is kept from organic substances, such substances will not decay. The\r\nbox is sterilized; likewise the tubes (_t_) containing nutrients. Air is\r\nallowed to enter by the tubes (_u_), which are so made that dust is\r\nprevented from entering. A thermometer (_th_) records the temperature. The\r\nsubstances in the tubes do not decay, no matter how favorable the\r\ntemperature.]\r\n\r\nLife comes from Life.--Another group of men, after years of patient\r\nexperimentation, worked out the fact that _life comes from other life_. In\r\nancient times it was thought that life arose _spontaneously_; for example,\r\nthat fish or frogs arose out of the mud of the river bottoms, and that\r\ninsects came from the dew or rotting meat. It was believed that bacteria\r\narose spontaneously in water, even as late as 1876, when Professor Tyndall\r\nproved by experiment the contrary to be true.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1651 William Harvey, the court physician of Charles I of\r\nEngland, showed that all life came from the egg. It was much later,\r\nhowever, that the part played by the sperm and egg cell in fertilization\r\nwas carefully worked out. It is to Harvey, too, that we owe the beginnings\r\nof our knowledge of the circulation of the blood. He showed that blood\r\nmoved through tubes in the body and that the heart pumped it. He might be\r\ncalled the father of modern physiology as well as the father of embryology.\r\nA long list of names might be added to that of Harvey to show how gradually\r\nour knowledge of the working of the human body has been added to. At the\r\npresent time we are far from knowing all the functions of the various parts\r\nof the human engine, as is shown by the number of investigators in\r\nphysiology at the present time. Present-day problems have much to do with\r\nthe care of the human mechanism and with its surroundings. The solution of\r\nthese problems will come from applying the sciences of hygiene, preventive\r\nmedicine, and sanitation.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters of this book we have learned something about our\r\nbodies and their care. We have found that man is able within limitations to\r\ncontrol his environment so as to make it better to live in. All of the\r\nscientific facts that have been of use to man in the control of disease\r\nhave been found out by men who have devoted their lives in the hope that\r\ntheir experiments and their sacrifices of time, energy, and sometimes life\r\nitself might make for the betterment of the human race. Such men were\r\nHarvey, Jenner, Lister, Koch, and Pasteur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edward Jenner, the discoverer of vaccination.]\r\n\r\nEdward Jenner and Vaccination.--The civilized world owes much to Edward\r\nJenner, the discoverer of vaccination against smallpox. Born in Berkeley, a\r\nlittle town of Gloucestershire, England, in 1749, as a boy he showed a\r\nstrong liking for natural history. He studied medicine and also gave much\r\ntime to the working out of biological problems. As early as 1775 he began\r\nto associate the disease called cowpox with that of smallpox, and gradually\r\nthe idea of inoculation against this terrible scourge, which killed or\r\ndisfigured hundreds of thousands every year in England alone, was worked\r\nout and applied. He believed that if the two diseases were similar, a\r\nperson inoculated with the mild disease (cowpox) would after a slight\r\nattack of this disease be immune against the more deadly and loathsome\r\nsmallpox. It was not until 1796 that he was able to prove his theory, as at\r\nfirst few people would submit to vaccination. War at this time was being\r\nwaged between France and England, so that the former country, usually so\r\nquick to appreciate the value of scientific discoveries, was slow to give\r\nthis method a trial. In spite of much opposition, however, by the year\r\n1802, vaccination was practiced in most of the civilized countries of the\r\nworld. At the present time the death rate in Great Britain, the home of\r\nvaccination, is less than .3 to every 1,000,000 living persons. This shows\r\nthat the disease is practically wiped out in England. An interesting\r\ncomparison with these figures might be made from the history of the disease\r\nin parts of Russia where vaccination is not practiced. There, thousands of\r\ndeaths from smallpox occur annually. During the winter of 1913-1914 an\r\nepidemic of smallpox with more than 250 cases broke out in the city of\r\nNiagara Falls. This epidemic appears to be due to a campaign conducted by\r\npeople who do not believe in vaccination. In cities and towns near by,\r\nwhere vaccination was practiced, no cases of smallpox occurred. Naturally\r\nif opposition to vaccination is found nowadays, Jenner had a much harder\r\nbattle to fight in his day. He also had many failures, due to the imperfect\r\nmethods of his time. The full worth of his discovery was not fully\r\nappreciated until long after his death, which occurred in 1823.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis Pasteur.]\r\n\r\nLouis Pasteur.--The one man who, in biological science, did more than any\r\nother to directly benefit mankind was Louis Pasteur. Born in 1822, in the\r\nmountains near the border of northeastern France, he spent the early part\r\nof his life as a normal boy, fond of fishing and not very partial to study.\r\nHe inherited from his father, however, a fine character and grim\r\ndetermination, so that when he became interested in scientific pursuits he\r\nsettled down to work with enthusiasm and energy.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-five he became well known throughout France as a\r\nphysicist. Shortly after this he became interested in the tiny plants we\r\ncall bacteria, and it was in the field of bacteriology that he became most\r\nfamous. First as professor at Strassburg and at Lille, later as director of\r\nscientific studies in the Ecole Normale at Paris, he showed his interest in\r\nthe application of his discoveries to human welfare.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Pasteur showed that fermentation was due to the presence of\r\nbacteria, it having been thought up to this time that it was a purely\r\nchemical process. This discovery led to very practical ends, for France was\r\na great wine-producing country, and with a knowledge of the cause of\r\nfermentation many of the diseases which spoiled wine were checked.\r\n\r\nIn 1865-1868 Pasteur turned his attention to a silkworm disease which\r\nthreatened to wipe out the silk industry of France and Italy. He found that\r\nthis disease was caused by bacteria. After a careful study of the case he\r\nmade certain recommendations which, when carried out, resulted in the\r\ncomplete overthrow of the disease and the saving of millions of dollars to\r\nthe poor people of France and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe greatest service to mankind came later in his life when he applied\r\ncertain of his discoveries to the treatment of disease. First experimenting\r\nupon chickens and later with cattle, he proved that by making a virus\r\n(poison) from the germs which caused certain diseases he could reduce this\r\nvirus to any desired strength. He then inoculated the animals with the\r\nvirus of reduced strength, giving the inoculated animals a mild attack of\r\nthe disease, and found that this made them _immune_ from future attacks.\r\nThis discovery, first applied to chicken cholera, laid the foundation for\r\nall future work in the uses of serums, vaccines, and antitoxins.\r\n\r\nPasteur was perhaps the best known through his study of rabies. The great\r\nPasteur Institute, founded by popular subscriptions from all over the\r\nworld, has successfully treated over 22,000 cases of rabies with a death\r\nrate of less than 1 per cent. But more than that it has been the place\r\nwhere Roux, a fellow worker with Pasteur, discovered the antitoxin for\r\ndiphtheria which has resulted in the saving of thousands of human lives.\r\nHere also have been established the principles of inoculation against\r\nbubonic plague, lockjaw, and other germ diseases.\r\n\r\nPasteur died in 1895 at the age of seventy-three, \"the most perfect man in\r\nthe realm of science,\" a man beloved by his countrymen and honored by the\r\nentire world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robert Koch.]\r\n\r\nRobert Koch.--Another name associated with the battle against disease germs\r\nis that of Robert Koch. Born in Klausthal, Hanover, in 1843, he later\r\nbecame a practicing physician, and about 1880 was called to Berlin to\r\nbecome a member of the sanitary commission and professor in the school of\r\nmedicine. In 1881 he discovered the germ that causes tuberculosis and two\r\nyears later the germ that causes Asiatic cholera. His later work has been\r\ndirected toward the discovery of a cure for tuberculosis and other germ\r\ndiseases. As yet, however, no certain cure seems to have been found.\r\n\r\nLister and Antiseptic Treatment of Wounds.--A third great benefactor of\r\nmankind was Sir Joseph Lister, an Englishman who was born in 1827. As a\r\nprofessor of surgery he first applied antiseptics in the operating room. By\r\nmeans of the use of carbolic acid or other antiseptics on the surface of\r\nwounds, on instruments, and on the hands and clothing of the operating\r\nsurgeons, disease germs were prevented from taking a foothold in the\r\nwounds. Thus blood poisoning was prevented. This single discovery has done\r\nmore to prevent death after operations than any other of recent time.\r\n\r\nModern Workers on the Blood.--At the present time several names stand out\r\namong investigators on the blood. Paul Ehrlich, a German born in 1854, is\r\njustly famous for his work on the blood and its relation to immunity from\r\ncertain diseases. His last great research has given to the world a specific\r\nagainst the dread disease syphilis.\r\n\r\nAnother name associated with the blood is that of Elias Metchnikoff, a\r\nRussian. He was born in 1845. Metchnikoff first advanced the belief that\r\nthe colorless blood corpuscles, or _phagocytes_, did service as the\r\nsanitary police of the body. He has found that there are several different\r\nkinds of colorless corpuscles, each having somewhat different work to do.\r\nMuch of the modern work done by physiologists on the blood are directly\r\nfounded on the discoveries of Metchnikoff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles Darwin, the grand old man of biology.]\r\n\r\nHeredity and Evolution. Charles Darwin.--There is still another important\r\nline of investigation in biology that we have not mentioned. This is the\r\ndoctrine of evolution and the allied discoveries along the line of\r\nheredity. The development or evolution of plants and animals from simpler\r\nforms to the many and present complex forms of life have a practical\r\nbearing on the betterment of plants and animals, including man himself. The\r\none name indelibly associated with the word evolution is that of Charles\r\nDarwin.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin was born on February 12, 1809, a son of well-to-do parents,\r\nin the pretty English village of Shrewsbury. As a boy he was very fond of\r\nout-of-door life, was a collector of birds' eggs, stamps, coins, shells,\r\nand minerals. He was an ardent fisherman, and as a young man became an\r\nexpert shot. His studies, those of the English classical school, were not\r\naltogether to his liking. It is not strange, perhaps, that he was thought a\r\nvery ordinary boy, because his interest in the out-of-doors led him to\r\nneglect his studies. Later he was sent to Edinburgh University to study\r\nmedicine. Here the dull lectures, coupled with his intense dislike for\r\noperations, made him determine never to become a physician. But all this\r\ntime he showed his intense interest in natural history and took frequent\r\npart in the discussions at the meetings of one of the student zoological\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 his father sent him to Cambridge to study for the ministry. His\r\nthree years at the university were wasted so far as preparation for the\r\nministry were concerned, but they were invaluable in shaping his future. He\r\nmade the acquaintance of one or two professors who were naturalists like\r\nhimself, and in their company he spent many happy hours in roaming over the\r\ncountryside collecting beetles and other insects. In 1831 an event occurred\r\nwhich changed his career and made Darwin one of the world's greatest\r\nnaturalists. He received word through one of his professional friends that\r\nthe position of naturalist on her Majesty's ship _Beagle_ was open for a\r\ntrip around the world. Darwin applied for the position, was accepted, and\r\nshortly after started on an eventful five years' trip around the world. He\r\nreturned to England a famous naturalist and spent the remainder of his long\r\nand busy life producing books which have done more than those of any other\r\nwriter to account in a satisfactory way for the changes of form and habits\r\nof plants and animals on the earth. His theories established a foundation\r\nupon which plant and animal breeders were able to work.\r\n\r\nHis wonderful discovery of the doctrine of evolution was due not only to\r\nhis information and experimental evidence, but also to an iron\r\ndetermination and undaunted energy. In spite of almost constant illness\r\nbrought about by eyestrain, he accomplished more than most well men have\r\ndone. His life should mean to us not so much the association of his name\r\nwith the _Origin of Species_ or _Plants and Animals under Domestication_,\r\ntwo of his most famous books, but rather that of a patient, courteous, and\r\nbrave gentleman who struggled with true English pluck against the odds of\r\ndisease and the attacks of hostile critics. He gave to the world the proofs\r\nof the theory on which we to-day base the progress of the world. Darwin\r\nlived long enough to see many of his critics turn about and come over to\r\nhis beliefs. He died on the 19th of April, 1882, at seventy-four years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAssociated with Darwin's name we must place two other co-workers on\r\nheredity and evolution, Alfred Russel Wallace, an Englishman who\r\nindependently and at about the same time reached many of the conclusions\r\nthat Darwin came to, and August Weissman, a German. The latter showed that\r\nthe protoplasm of the germ cells (eggs and sperms) is directly handed down\r\nfrom generation to generation, they being different from the other body\r\ncells from the very beginning. In 1883 a German named Boveri discovered\r\nthat the chromosomes of the egg and the sperm cell were at the time of\r\nfertilization just half in number of the other cells (see page 252) so that\r\na _fertilized_ egg was really a _whole cell_ made up of _two half cells_,\r\none from each parent. The chromosomes within the nucleus, we remember, are\r\nbelieved to be the bearers of the hereditary qualities handed down from\r\nparent to child. This discovery shows us some of the mechanics of heredity.\r\n\r\nApplications to Plant and Animal Breeding.--Turning to the practical\r\napplications of the scientific work on the method of heredity, the name of\r\nGregor Mendel, an Austrian monk, stands out most prominently. Mendel lived\r\nfrom 1822 until 1884. His work, of which we already have learned something\r\n(see page 258), remained undiscovered until a few years ago. The\r\napplication of his methods to plant and animal raising are of the utmost\r\nimportance because the breeder is able to separate the qualities he desires\r\nand breed for those qualities only. Another name we have mentioned with\r\nreference to plant breeding is Hugo de Vries, the Dutchman who recently\r\nshowed that in some cases plants arise as new species by sudden and great\r\nvariations known as _mutations_. And lastly, in our own California, Luther\r\nBurbank, by careful hybridizing, is making lasting fame with his new and\r\nuseful hybrid plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           REFERENCES\r\n\r\n     Conn, _Biology_.
