Our conceptions of the nature and structure of matter have been\r\nprofoundly influenced in recent years by investigations on the\r\nConduction of Electricity through Gases (see CONDUCTION, ELECTRIC) and\r\non Radio-activity (q.v.). These researches and the ideas which they have\r\nsuggested have already thrown much light on some of the most fundamental\r\nquestions connected with matter; they have, too, furnished us with far\r\nmore powerful methods for investigating many problems connected with the\r\nstructure of matter than those hitherto available. There is thus every\r\nreason to believe that our knowledge of the structure of matter will\r\nsoon become far more precise and complete than it is at present, for now\r\nwe have the means of settling by testing directly many points which are\r\nstill doubtful, but which formerly seemed far beyond the reach of\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe Molecular Theory of Matter--the only theory ever seriously\r\nadvocated--supposes that all visible forms of matter are collocations of\r\nsimpler and smaller portions. There has been a continuous tendency as\r\nscience has advanced to reduce further and further the number of the\r\ndifferent kinds of things of which all matter is supposed to be built\r\nup. First came the molecular theory teaching us to regard matter as made\r\nup of an enormous number of small particles, each kind of matter having\r\nits characteristic particle, thus the particles of water were supposed\r\nto be different from those of air and indeed from those of any other\r\nsubstance. Then came Dalton's Atomic Theory which taught that these\r\nmolecules, in spite of their almost infinite variety, were all built up\r\nof still smaller bodies, the atoms of the chemical elements, and that\r\nthe number of different types of these smaller bodies was limited to the\r\nsixty or seventy types which represent the atoms of the substance\r\nregarded by chemists as elements.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 Prout suggested that the atoms of the heavier chemical elements\r\nwere themselves composite and that they were all built up of atoms of\r\nthe lightest element, hydrogen, so that all the different forms of\r\nmatter are edifices built of the same material--the atom of hydrogen. If\r\nthe atoms of hydrogen do not alter in weight when they combine to form\r\natoms of other elements the atomic weights of all elements would be\r\nmultiples of that of hydrogen; though the number of elements whose\r\natomic weights are multiples or very nearly so of hydrogen is very\r\nstriking, there are several which are universally admitted to have\r\natomic weights differing largely from whole numbers. We do not know\r\nenough about gravity to say whether this is due to the change of weight\r\nof the hydrogen atoms when they combine to form other atoms, or whether\r\nthe primordial form from which all matter is built up is something other\r\nthan the hydrogen atom. Whatever may be the nature of this primordial\r\nform, the tendency of all recent discoveries has been to emphasize the\r\ntruth of the conception of a common basis of matter of all kinds. That\r\nthe atoms of the different elements have a common basis, that they\r\nbehave as if they consisted of different numbers of small particles of\r\nthe same kind, is proved to most minds by the Periodic Law of Mendeléeff\r\nand Newlands (see ELEMENT). This law shows that the physical and\r\nchemical properties of the different elements are determined by their\r\natomic weights, or to use the language of mathematics, the properties of\r\nan element are functions of its atomic weight. Now if we constructed\r\nmodels of the atoms out of different materials, the atomic weight would\r\nbe but one factor out of many which would influence the physical and\r\nchemical properties of the model, we should require to know more than\r\nthe atomic weight to fix its behaviour. If we were to plot a curve\r\nrepresenting the variation of some property of the substance with the\r\natomic weight we should not expect the curve to be a smooth one, for\r\ninstance two atoms might have the same atomic weight and yet if they\r\nwere made of different materials have no other property in common. The\r\ninfluence of the atomic weight on the properties of the elements is\r\nnowhere more strikingly shown than in the recent developments of physics\r\nconnected with the discharge of electricity through gases and with\r\nradio-activity. The transparency of bodies to Röntgen rays, to cathode\r\nrays, to the rays emitted by radio-active substances, the quality of the\r\nsecondary radiation emitted by the different elements are all determined\r\nby the atomic weight of the element. So much is this the case that the\r\nbehaviour of the element with respect to these rays has been used to\r\ndetermine its atomic weight, when as in the case of Indium, uncertainty\r\nas to the valency of the element makes the result of ordinary chemical\r\nmethods ambiguous.\r\n\r\nThe radio-active elements indeed furnish us with direct evidence of this\r\nunity of composition of matter, for not only does one element uranium,\r\nproduce another, radium, but all the radio-active substances give rise\r\nto helium, so that the substance of the atoms of this gas must be\r\ncontained in the atoms of the radio-active elements.\r\n\r\nIt is not radio-active atoms alone that contain a common constituent,\r\nfor it has been found that all bodies can by suitable treatment, such as\r\nraising them to incandescence or exposing them to ultra-violet light, be\r\nmade to emit negatively electrified particles, and that these particles\r\nare the same from whatever source they may be derived. These particles\r\nall carry the same charge of negative electricity and all have the same\r\nmass, this mass is exceedingly small even when compared with the mass of\r\nan atom of hydrogen, which until the discovery of these particles was\r\nthe smallest mass known to science. These particles are called\r\ncorpuscles or electrons; their mass according to the most recent\r\ndeterminations is only about 1/1700 of that of an atom of hydrogen, and\r\ntheir radius is only about one hundred-thousandth part of the radius of\r\nthe hydrogen atom. As corpuscles of this kind can be obtained from all\r\nsubstances, we infer that they form a constituent of the atoms of all\r\nbodies. The atoms of the different elements do not all contain the same\r\nnumber of corpuscles--there are more corpuscles in the atoms of the\r\nheavier elements than in the atoms of the lighter ones; in fact, many\r\ndifferent considerations point to the conclusion that the number of\r\ncorpuscles in the atom of any element is proportional to the atomic\r\nweight of the element. Different methods of estimating the exact number\r\nof corpuscles in the atom have all led to the conclusion that this\r\nnumber is of the same order as the atomic weight; that, for instance,\r\nthe number of corpuscles in the atom of oxygen is not a large multiple\r\nof 16. Some methods indicate that the number of corpuscles in the atom\r\nis equal to the atomic weight, while the maximum value obtained by any\r\nmethod is only about four times the atomic weight. This is one of the\r\npoints on which further experiments will enable us to speak with greater\r\nprecision. Thus one of the constituents of all atoms is the negatively\r\ncharged corpuscle; since the atoms are electrically neutral, this\r\nnegative charge must be accompanied by an equal positive one, so that on\r\nthis view the atoms must contain a charge of positive electricity\r\nproportional to the atomic weight; the way in which this positive\r\nelectricity is arranged is a matter of great importance in the\r\nconsideration of the constitution of matter. The question naturally\r\narises, is the positive electricity done up into definite units like the\r\nnegative, or does it merely indicate a property acquired by an atom when\r\none or more corpuscles leave it? It is very remarkable that we have up\r\nto the present (1910), in spite of many investigations on this point, no\r\ndirect evidence of the existence of positively charged particles with a\r\nmass comparable with that of a corpuscle; the smallest positive particle\r\nof which we have any direct indication has a mass equal to the mass of\r\nan atom of hydrogen, and it is a most remarkable fact that we get\r\npositively charged particles having this mass when we send the electric\r\ndischarge through gases at low pressures, whatever be the kind of gas.\r\nIt is no doubt exceedingly difficult to get rid of traces of hydrogen in\r\nvessels containing gases at low pressures through which an electric\r\ndischarge is passing, but the circumstances under which the positively\r\nelectrified particles just alluded to appear, and the way in which they\r\nremain unaltered in spite of all efforts to clear out any traces of\r\nhydrogen, all seem to indicate that these positively electrified\r\nparticles, whose mass is equal to that of an atom of hydrogen, do not\r\ncome from minute traces of hydrogen present as an impurity but from the\r\noxygen, nitrogen, or helium, or whatever may be the gas through which\r\nthe discharge passes. If this is so, then the most natural conclusion we\r\ncan come to is that these positively electrified particles with the mass\r\nof the atom of hydrogen are the natural units of positive electricity,\r\njust as the corpuscles are those of negative, and that these positive\r\nparticles form a part of all atoms.\r\n\r\nThus in this way we are led to an electrical view of the constitution of\r\nthe atom. We regard the atom as built up of units of negative\r\nelectricity and of an equal number of units of positive electricity;\r\nthese two units are of very different mass, the mass of the negative\r\nunit being only 1/1700 of that of the positive. The number of units of\r\neither kind is proportional to the atomic weight of the element and of\r\nthe same order as this quantity. Whether this is anything besides the\r\npositive and negative electricity in the atom we do not know. In the\r\npresent state of our knowledge of the properties of matter it is\r\nunnecessary to postulate the existence of anything besides these\r\npositive and negative units.\r\n\r\nThe atom of a chemical element on this view of the constitution of\r\nmatter is a system formed by n corpuscles and n units of positive\r\nelectricity which is in equilibrium or in a state of steady motion under\r\nthe electrical forces which the charged 2n constituents exert upon each\r\nother. Sir J. J. Thomson (_Phil. Mag._, March 1904, \"Corpuscular Theory\r\nof Matter\") has investigated the systems in steady motion which can be\r\nformed by various numbers of negatively electrified particles immersed\r\nin a sphere of uniform positive electrification, a case, which in\r\nconsequence of the enormous volume of the units of positive electricity\r\nin comparison with that of the negative has much in common with the\r\nproblem under consideration, and has shown that some of the properties\r\nof n systems of corpuscles vary in a periodic way suggestive of the\r\nPeriodic Law in Chemistry as n is continually increased.\r\n\r\n_Mass on the Electrical Theory of Matter._--One of the most\r\ncharacteristic things about matter is the possession of mass. When we\r\ntake the electrical theory of matter the idea of mass takes new and\r\ninteresting forms. This point may be illustrated by the case of a single\r\nelectrified particle; when this moves it produces in the region around\r\nit a magnetic field, the magnetic force being proportional to the\r\nvelocity of the electrified particle.[1] In a magnetic field, however,\r\nthere is energy, and the amount of energy per unit volume at any place\r\nis proportional to the square of the magnetic force at that place. Thus\r\nthere will be energy distributed through the space around the moving\r\nparticle, and when the velocity of the particle is small compared with\r\nthat of light we can easily show that the energy in the region around\r\nthe charged particle is ([mu]e²)/(3a), when v is the velocity of the\r\nparticle, e its charge, a its radius, and [mu] the magnetic permeability\r\nof the region round the particle. If m is the ordinary mass of the\r\nparticle, the part of the kinetic energy due to the motion of this mass\r\nis ½mv², thus the total kinetic energy is ½[m + (2/3)[mu]e²/a]. Thus the\r\nelectric charge on the particle makes it behave as if its mass were\r\nincreased by (2/3)[mu]e²/a. Since this increase in mass is due to the\r\nenergy in the region outside the charged particle, it is natural to look\r\nto that region for this additional mass. This region is traversed by the\r\ntubes of force which start from the electrified body and move with it,\r\nand a very simple calculation shows that we should get the increase in\r\nthe mass which is due to the electrification if we suppose that these\r\ntubes of force as they move carry with them a certain amount of the\r\nether, and that this ether had mass. The mass of ether thus carried\r\nalong must be such that the amount of it in unit volume at any part of\r\nthe field is such that if this were to move with the velocity of light\r\nits kinetic energy would be equal to the potential energy of the\r\nelectric field in the unit volume under consideration. When a tube moves\r\nthis mass of ether only participates in the motion at right angles to\r\nthe tube, it is not set in motion by a movement of the tube along its\r\nlength. We may compare the mass which a charged body acquires in virtue\r\nof its charge with the additional mass which a ball apparently acquires\r\nwhen it is placed in water; a ball placed in water behaves as if its\r\nmass were greater than its mass when moving in vacuo; we can easily\r\nunderstand why this should be the case, because when the ball in the\r\nwater moves the water around it must move as well; so that when a force\r\nacting on the ball sets it in motion it has to move some of the water as\r\nwell as the ball, and thus the ball behaves as if its mass were\r\nincreased. Similarly in the case of the electrified particle, which when\r\nit moves carries with it its lines of force, which grip the ether and\r\ncarry some of it along with them. When the electrified particle is moved\r\na mass of ether has to be moved too, and thus the apparent mass of the\r\nparticle is increased. The mass of the electrified particle is thus\r\nresident in every part of space reached by its lines of force; in this\r\nsense an electrified body may be said to extend to an infinite distance;\r\nthe amount of the mass of the ether attached to the particle diminishes\r\nso rapidly as we recede from it that the contributions of regions remote\r\nfrom the particle are quite insignificant, and in the case of a\r\nparticle as small as a corpuscle not one millionth part of its mass will\r\nbe farther away from it than the radius of an atom.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the mass of a particle due to given charges varies as we\r\nhave seen inversely as the radius of the particle; thus the smaller the\r\nparticle the greater the increase in the mass. For bodies of appreciable\r\nsize or even for those as small as ordinary atoms the effect of any\r\nrealizable electric charge is quite insignificant, on the other hand for\r\nthe smallest bodies known, the corpuscle, there is evidence that the\r\nwhole of the mass is due to the electric charge. This result has been\r\ndeduced by the help of an extremely interesting property of the mass due\r\nto a charge of electricity, which is that this mass is not constant but\r\nvaries with the velocity. This comes about in the following way. When\r\nthe charged particle, which for simplicity we shall suppose to be\r\nspherical, is at rest or moving very slowly the lines of electric force\r\nare distributed uniformly around it in all directions; when the sphere\r\nmoves, however, magnetic forces are produced in the region around it,\r\nwhile these, in consequence of electro-magnetic induction in a moving\r\nmagnetic field, give rise to electric forces which displace the tubes of\r\nelectric force in such a way as to make them set themselves so as to be\r\nmore at right angles to the direction in which they are moving than they\r\nwere before. Thus if the charged sphere were moving along the line AB,\r\nthe tubes of force would, when the sphere was in motion, tend to leave\r\nthe region near AB and crowd towards a plane through the centre of the\r\nsphere and at right angles to AB, where they would be moving more nearly\r\nat right angles to themselves. This crowding of the lines of force\r\nincreases, however, the potential energy of the electric field, and\r\nsince the mass of the ether carried along by the lines of force is\r\nproportional to the potential energy, the mass of the charged particle\r\nwill also be increased. The amount of variation of the mass with the\r\nvelocity depends to some extent on the assumptions we make as to the\r\nshape of the corpuscle and the way in which it is electrified. The\r\nsimplest expression connecting the mass with the velocity is that when\r\nthe velocity is v the mass is equal to (2/3)[mu]e²/a [1/(1 - v²/c²)^½]\r\nwhere c is the velocity of light. We see from this that the variation of\r\nmass with velocity is very small unless the velocity of the body\r\napproaches that of light, but when, as in the case of the [beta]\r\nparticles emitted by radium, the velocity is only a few per cent less\r\nthan that of light, the effect of velocity on the mass becomes very\r\nconsiderable; the formula indicates that if the particles were moving\r\nwith a velocity equal to that of light they would behave as if their\r\nmass were infinite. By observing the variation in the mass of a\r\ncorpuscle as its velocity changes we can determine how much of the mass\r\ndepends upon the electric charge and how much is independent of it. For\r\nsince the latter part of the mass is independent of the velocity, if it\r\npredominates the variation with velocity of the mass of a corpuscle will\r\nbe small; if on the other hand it is negligible the variation in mass\r\nwith velocity will be that indicated by theory given above. The\r\nexperiment of Kaufmann (_Göttingen Nach._, Nov. 8, 1901), Bucherer\r\n(_Ann. der Physik._, xxviii. 513, 1909) on the masses of the [beta]\r\nparticles shot out by radium, as well as those by Hupka (_Berichte der\r\ndeutsch. physik. Gesell._, 1909, p. 249) on the masses of the corpuscle\r\nin cathode rays are in agreement with the view that the _whole_ of the\r\nmass of these particles is due to their electric charge.\r\n\r\nThe alteration in the mass of a moving charge with its velocity is\r\nprimarily due to the increase in the potential energy which accompanies\r\nthe increase in velocity. The connexion between potential energy and\r\nmass is general and holds for any arrangement of electrified particles;\r\nthus if we assume the electrical constitution of matter, there will be a\r\npart of the mass of any system dependent upon the potential energy and\r\nin fact proportional to it. Thus every change in potential energy, such\r\nfor example as occurs when two elements combine with evolution or\r\nabsorption of heat, must be attended by a change in mass. The amount of\r\nthis change can be calculated by the rule that if a mass equal to the\r\nchange in mass were to move with the velocity of light its kinetic\r\nenergy would equal the change in the potential energy. If we apply this\r\nresult to the case of the combination of hydrogen and oxygen, where the\r\nevolution of heat, about 1.6 × 10^11 ergs per gramme of water, is\r\ngreater than in any other known case of chemical combination, we see\r\nthat the change in mass would only amount to one part in 3000 million,\r\nwhich is far beyond the reach of experiment. The evolution of energy by\r\nradio-active substances is enormously larger than in ordinary chemical\r\ntransformations; thus one gramme of radium emits per day about as much\r\nenergy as is evolved in the formation of one gramme of water, and goes\r\non doing this for thousands of years. We see, however, that even in this\r\ncase it would require hundreds of years before the changes in mass\r\nbecame appreciable.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of energy from the gaseous emanation given off by radium\r\nis more rapid than that from radium itself, since according to the\r\nexperiments of Rutherford (Rutherford, _Radio-activity_, p. 432) a\r\ngramme of the emanation would evolve about 2.1 × 10^16 ergs in four\r\ndays; this by the rule given above would diminish the mass by about one\r\npart in 20,000; but since only very small quantities of the emanation\r\ncould be used the detection of the change of mass does not seem feasible\r\neven in this case.\r\n\r\nOn the view we have been discussing the existence of potential energy\r\ndue to an electric field is always associated with mass; wherever there\r\nis potential energy there is mass. On the electro-magnetic theory of\r\nlight, however, a wave of light is accompanied by electric forces, and\r\ntherefore by potential energy; thus waves of light must behave as if\r\nthey possessed mass. It may be shown that it follows from the same\r\nprinciples that they must also possess momentum, the direction of the\r\nmomentum being the direction along which the light is travelling; when\r\nthe light is absorbed by an opaque substance the momentum in the light\r\nis communicated to the substance, which therefore behaves as if the\r\nlight pressed upon it. The pressure exerted by light was shown by\r\nMaxwell (_Electricity and Magnetism_, 3rd ed., p. 440) to be a\r\nconsequence of his electro-magnetic theory, its existence has been\r\nestablished by the experiment of Lebedew, of Nichols and Hull, and of\r\nPoynting.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Weight.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto been considering mass from the point of view that the\r\nconstitution of matter is electrical; we shall proceed to consider the\r\nquestion of weight from the same point of view. The relation between\r\nmass and weight is, while the simplest in expression, perhaps the most\r\nfundamental and mysterious property possessed by matter. The weight of a\r\nbody is proportional to its mass, that is if the weights of a number of\r\nsubstances are equal the masses will be equal, whatever the substances\r\nmay be. This result was verified to a considerable degree of\r\napproximation by Newton by means of experiments with pendulums; later,\r\nin 1830 Bessel by a very extensive and accurate series of experiments,\r\nalso made on pendulums, showed that the ratio of mass to weight was\r\ncertainly to one part in 60,000 the same for all the substances examined\r\nby him, these included brass, silver, iron, lead, copper, ivory, water.\r\n\r\nThe constancy of this ratio acquires new interest when looked at from\r\nthe point of view of the electrical constitution of matter. We have seen\r\nthat the atoms of all bodies contain corpuscles, that the mass of a\r\ncorpuscle is only 1/1700 of the mass of an atom of hydrogen, that it\r\ncarries a constant charge of negative electricity, and that its mass is\r\nentirely due to this charge, and can be regarded as arising from ether\r\ngripped by the lines of force starting from the electrical charge. The\r\nquestion at once suggests itself, Is this kind of mass ponderable? does\r\nit add to the weight of the body? and, if so, is the proportion between\r\nmass and weight the same as for ordinary bodies? Let us suppose for a\r\nmoment that this mass is not ponderable, so that the corpuscles increase\r\nthe mass but not the weight of an atom. Then, since the mass of a\r\ncorpuscle is 1/1700 that of an atom of hydrogen, the addition or removal\r\nof one corpuscle would in the case of an atom of atomic weight x alter\r\nthe mass by one part in 1700 x, without altering the weight, this would\r\nproduce an effect of the same magnitude on the ratio of mass to weight\r\nand would in the case of the atoms of the lighter elements be easily\r\nmeasurable in experiments of the same order of accuracy as those made by\r\nBessel. If the number of corpuscles in the atom were proportional to the\r\natomic weight, then the ratio of mass to weight would be constant\r\nwhether the corpuscles were ponderable or not. If the number were not\r\nproportional there would be greater discrepancies in the ratio of mass\r\nto weight than is consistent with Bessel's experiments if the corpuscles\r\nhad no weight. We have seen there are other grounds for concluding that\r\nthe number of corpuscles in an atom is proportional to the atom weight,\r\nso that the constancy of the ratio of mass to weight for a large number\r\nof substances does not enable us to determine whether or not mass due to\r\ncharges of electricity is ponderable or not.\r\n\r\nThere seems some hope that the determination of this ratio for\r\nradio-active substances may throw some light on this point. The enormous\r\namount of heat evolved by these bodies may indicate that they possess\r\nmuch greater stores of potential energy than other substances. If we\r\nsuppose that the heat developed by one gramme of a radio-active\r\nsubstance in the transformations which it undergoes before it reaches\r\nthe non-radio-active stage is a measure of the excess of the potential\r\nenergy in a gramme of this substance above that in a gramme of\r\nnon-radio-active substance, it would follow that a larger part of the\r\nmass was due to electric charges in radio-active than in\r\nnon-radio-active substances; in the case of uranium this difference\r\nwould amount to at least one part in 20,000 of the total mass. If this\r\nextra mass had no weight the ratio of mass to weight for uranium would\r\ndiffer from the normal amount by more than one part in 20,000, a\r\nquantity quite within the range of pendulum experiments. It thus appears\r\nvery desirable to make experiments on the ratio of mass to weight for\r\nradio-active substances. Sir J. J. Thomson, by swinging a small pendulum\r\nwhose bob was made of radium bromide, has shown that this ratio for\r\nradium does not differ from the normal by one part in 2000. The small\r\nquantity of radium available prevented the attainment of greater\r\naccuracy. Experiments just completed (1910) by Southerns at the\r\nCavendish Laboratory on this ratio for uranium show that it is normal to\r\nan accuracy of one part in 200,000; indicating that in non-radio-active,\r\nas in radio-active, substances the electrical mass is proportional to\r\nthe atomic weight.\r\n\r\nThough but few experiments have been made in recent years on the value\r\nof the ratio of mass to weight, many important investigations have been\r\nmade on the effect of alterations in the chemical and physical\r\nconditions on the weight of bodies. These have all led to the conclusion\r\nthat no change which can be detected by our present means of\r\ninvestigation occurs in the weight of a body in consequence of any\r\nphysical or chemical changes yet investigated. Thus Landolt, who devoted\r\na great number of years to the question whether any change in weight\r\noccurs during chemical combination, came finally to the conclusion that\r\nin no case out of the many he investigated did any measurable change of\r\nweight occur during chemical combination. Poynting and Phillips (_Proc.\r\nRoy. Soc._, 76, p. 445), as well as Southerns (78, p. 392), have shown\r\nthat change in temperature produces no change in the weight of a body;\r\nand Poynting has also shown that neither the weight of a crystal nor the\r\nattraction between two crystals depends at all upon the direction in\r\nwhich the axis of the crystal points. The result of these laborious and\r\nvery carefully made experiments has been to strengthen the conviction\r\nthat the weight of a given portion of matter is absolutely independent\r\nof its physical condition or state of chemical combinations. It should,\r\nhowever, be noticed that we have as yet no accurate investigation as to\r\nwhether or not any changes of weight occur during radio-active\r\ntransformations, such for example as the emanation from radium undergoes\r\nwhen the atoms themselves of the substance are disrupted.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of some interest in connexion with a discussion of any\r\nviews of the constitution of matter to consider the theories of\r\ngravitation which have been put forward to explain that apparently\r\ninvariable property of matter--its weight. It would be impossible to\r\nconsider in detail the numerous theories which have been put forward to\r\naccount for gravitation; a concise summary of many of these has been\r\ngiven by Drude (Wied. _Ann._ 62, p. 1);[2] there is no dearth of\r\ntheories as to the cause of gravitation, what is lacking is the means of\r\nputting any of them to a decisive test.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two theories of gravitation, both old, which seem to\r\nbe especially closely connected with the idea of the electrical\r\nconstitution of matter. The first of these is the theory, associated\r\nwith the two fluid theory of electricity, that gravity is a kind of\r\nresidual electrical effect, due to the attraction between the units of\r\npositive and negative electricity being a little greater than the\r\nrepulsion between the units of electricity of the same kind. Thus on\r\nthis view two charges of equal magnitude, but of opposite sign, would\r\nexert an attraction varying inversely as the square of the distance on a\r\ncharge of electricity of either sign, and therefore an attraction on a\r\nsystem consisting of two charges equal in magnitude but opposite in sign\r\nforming an electrically neutral system. Thus if we had two neutral\r\nsystems, A and B, A consisting of m positive units of electricity and an\r\nequal number of negative, while B has n units of each kind, then the\r\ngravitational attraction between A and B would be inversely proportional\r\nto the square of the distance and proportional to n m. The connexion\r\nbetween this view of gravity and that of the electrical constitution of\r\nmatter is evidently very close, for if gravity arose in this way the\r\nweight of a body would only depend upon the number of units of\r\nelectricity in the body. On the view that the constitution of matter is\r\nelectrical, the fundamental units which build up matter are the units of\r\nelectric charge, and as the magnitude of these charges does not change,\r\nwhatever chemical or physical vicissitudes matter, the weight of matter\r\nought not to be affected by such changes. There is one result of this\r\ntheory which might possibly afford a means of testing it: since the\r\ncharge on a corpuscle is equal to that on a positive unit, the weights\r\nof the two are equal; but the mass of the corpuscle is only 1/1700 of\r\nthat of the positive unit, so that the acceleration of the corpuscle\r\nunder gravity will be 1700 times that of the positive unit, which we\r\nshould expect to be the same as that for ponderable matter or 981.\r\n\r\nThe acceleration of the corpuscle under gravity on this view would be\r\n1.6 × 10^6. It does not seem altogether impossible that with methods\r\nslightly more powerful than those we now possess we might measure the\r\neffect of gravity on a corpuscle if the acceleration were as large as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe other theory of gravitation to which we call attention is that due\r\nto Le Sage of Geneva and published in 1818. Le Sage supposed that the\r\nuniverse was thronged with exceedingly small particles moving with very\r\ngreat velocities. These particles he called ultra-mundane corpuscles,\r\nbecause they came to us from regions far beyond the solar system. He\r\nassumed that these were so penetrating that they could pass through\r\nmasses as large as the sun or the earth without being absorbed to more\r\nthan a very small extent. There is, however, some absorption, and if\r\nbodies are made up of the same kind of atoms, whose dimensions are small\r\ncompared with the distances between them, the absorption will be\r\nproportional to the mass of the body. So that as the ultra-mundane\r\ncorpuscles stream through the body a small fraction, proportional to the\r\nmass of the body, of their momentum is communicated to it. If the\r\ndirection of the ultra-mundane corpuscles passing through the body were\r\nuniformly distributed, the momentum communicated by them to the body\r\nwould not tend to move it in one direction rather than in another, so\r\nthat a body, A, alone in the universe and exposed to bombardment by the\r\nultra-mundane corpuscles would remain at rest. If, however, there were a\r\nsecond body, B, in the neighbourhood of A, B will shield A from some of\r\nthe corpuscles moving in the direction BA; thus A will not receive as\r\nmuch momentum in this direction as when it was alone; but in this case\r\nit only received just enough to keep it in equilibrium, so that when B\r\nis present the momentum in the opposite direction will get the upper\r\nhand and A will move in the direction AB, and will thus be attracted by\r\nB. Similarly, we see that B will be attracted by A. Le Sage proved that\r\nthe rate at which momentum was being communicated to A or B by the\r\npassage through them of his corpuscles was proportional to the product\r\nof the masses of A and B, and if the distance between A and B was large\r\ncompared with their dimensions, inversely proportional to the square of\r\nthe distance between them; in fact, that the forces acting on them would\r\nobey the same laws as the gravitational attraction between them. Clerk\r\nMaxwell (article \"ATOM,\" _Ency. Brit._, 9th ed.) pointed out that this\r\ntransference of momentum from the ultra-mundane corpuscles to the body\r\nthrough which they passed involved the loss of kinetic energy by the\r\ncorpuscles, and if the loss of momentum were large enough to account for\r\nthe gravitational attraction, the loss of kinetic energy would be so\r\nlarge that if converted into heat it would be sufficient to keep the\r\nbody white hot. We need not, however, suppose that this energy is\r\nconverted into heat; it might, as in the case where Röntgen rays are\r\nproduced by the passage of electrified corpuscles through matter, be\r\ntransformed into the energy of a still more penetrating form of\r\nradiation, which might escape from the gravitating body without heating\r\nit. It is a very interesting result of recent discoveries that the\r\nmachinery which Le Sage introduced for the purpose of his theory has a\r\nvery close analogy with things for which we have now direct experimental\r\nevidence. We know that small particles moving with very high speeds do\r\nexist, that they possess considerable powers of penetrating solids,\r\nthough not, as far as we know at present, to an extent comparable with\r\nthat postulated by Le Sage; and we know that the energy lost by them as\r\nthey pass through a solid is to a large extent converted into a still\r\nmore penetrating form of radiation, Röntgen rays. In Le Sage's theory\r\nthe only function of the corpuscles is to act as carriers of momentum,\r\nany systems which possessed momentum, moved with a high velocity and had\r\nthe power of penetrating solids, might be substituted for them; now\r\nwaves of electric and magnetic force, such as light waves or Röntgen\r\nrays, possess momentum, move with a high velocity, and the latter at any\r\nrate possess considerable powers of penetration; so that we might\r\nformulate a theory in which penetrating Röntgen rays replaced Le Sage's\r\ncorpuscles. Röntgen rays, however, when absorbed do not, as far as we\r\nknow, give rise to more penetrating Röntgen rays as they should to\r\nexplain attraction, but either to less penetrating rays or to rays of\r\nthe same kind.\r\n\r\nWe have confined our attention in this article to the view that the\r\nconstitution of matter is electrical; we have done so because this view\r\nis more closely in touch with experiment than any other yet advanced.\r\nThe units of which matter is built up on this theory have been isolated\r\nand detected in the laboratory, and we may hope to discover more and\r\nmore of their properties. By seeing whether the properties of matter are\r\nor are not such as would arise from a collection of units having these\r\nproperties, we can apply to this theory tests of a much more definite\r\nand rigorous character than we can apply to any other theory of matter.\r\n     (J.

It\r\nrises S.W. of the village of Zermatt, and on the frontier between\r\nSwitzerland (canton of the Valais) and Italy. Though on the Swiss side\r\nit appears to be an isolated obelisk, it is really but the butt end of a\r\nridge, while the Swiss slope is not nearly as steep or difficult as the\r\ngrand terraced walls of the Italian slope. It was first conquered, after\r\na number of attempts chiefly on the Italian side, on the 14th of July\r\n1865, by Mr E. Whymper's party, three members of which (Lord Francis\r\nDouglas, the Rev. C. Hudson and Mr Hadow) with the guide, Michel Croz,\r\nperished by a slip on the descent. Three days later it was scaled from\r\nthe Italian side by a party of men from Val Tournanche. Nowadays it is\r\nfrequently ascended in summer, especially from Zermatt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTEUCCI, CARLO (1811-1868), Italian physicist, was born at Forlì on\r\nthe 20th of June 1811. After attending the École Polytechnique at\r\nParis, he became professor of physics successively at Bologna (1832),\r\nRavenna (1837) and Pisa (1840). From 1847 he took an active part in\r\npolitics, and in 1860 was chosen an Italian senator, at the same time\r\nbecoming inspector-general of the Italian telegraph lines. Two years\r\nlater he was minister of education. He died near Leghorn on the 25th of\r\nJune 1868.\r\n\r\n  He was the author of four scientific treatises: _Lezioni di fisica_ (2\r\n  vols., Pisa, 1841), _Lezioni sui fenomeni fisicochimici dei corpi\r\n  viventi_ (Pisa, 1844), _Manuale di telegrafia elettrica_ (Pisa, 1850)\r\n  and _Cours spécial sur l'induction, le magnetisme de rotation_, &c.\r\n  (Paris, 1854). His numerous papers were published in the _Annales de\r\n  chimie et de physique_ (1829-1858); and most of them also appeared at\r\n  the time in the Italian scientific journals. They relate almost\r\n  entirely to electrical phenomena, such as the magnetic rotation of\r\n  light, the action of gas batteries, the effects of torsion on\r\n  magnetism, the polarization of electrodes, &c., sufficiently complete\r\n  accounts of which are given in Wiedemann's _Galvanismus_. Nine\r\n  memoirs, entitled \"Electro-Physiological Researches,\" were published\r\n  in the _Philosophical Transactions_, 1845-1860. See Bianchi's _Carlo\r\n  Matteucci e l'Italia del suo tempo_ (Rome, 1874).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEW, ST ([Greek: Maththaios] or [Greek: Matthaios], probably a\r\nshortened form of the Hebrew equivalent to Theodorus), one of the twelve\r\napostles, and the traditional author of the First Gospel, where he is\r\ndescribed as having been a tax-gatherer or customs-officer ([Greek:\r\ntelônês], x. 3), in the service of the tetrarch Herod. The circumstances\r\nof his call to become a follower of Jesus, received as he sat in the\r\n\"customs house\" in one of the towns by the Sea of Galilee--apparently\r\nCapernaum (Mark ii. 1, 13), are briefly related in ix. 9. We should\r\ngather from the parallel narrative in Mark ii. 14, Luke v. 27, that he\r\nwas at the time known as \"Levi the son of Alphaeus\" (compare Simon\r\nCephas, Joseph Barnabas): if so, \"James the son of Alphaeus\" may have\r\nbeen his brother. Possibly \"Matthew\" (Yahweh's gift) was his Christian\r\nsurname, since two native names, neither being a patronymic, is contrary\r\nto Jewish usage. It must be noted, however, that Matthew and Levi were\r\nsometimes distinguished in early times, as by Heracleon (c. 170 A.D.),\r\nand more dubiously by Origen (c. _Celsum_, i. 62), also apparently in\r\nthe Syriac _Didascalia_ (sec. iii.), V. xiv. 14. It has generally been\r\nsupposed, on the strength of Luke's account (v. 29), that Matthew gave a\r\nfeast in Jesus' honour (like Zacchaeus, Luke xix. 6 seq.). But Mark (ii.\r\n15), followed by Matthew (ix. 10), may mean that the meal in question\r\nwas one in Jesus' own home at Capernaum (cf. v. 1). In the lists of the\r\nApostles given in the Synoptic Gospels and in Acts, Matthew ranks third\r\nor fourth in the second group of four--a fair index of his relative\r\nimportance in the apostolic age. The only other facts related of Matthew\r\non good authority concern him as Evangelist. Eusebius (_H.E._ iii. 24)\r\nsays that he, like John, wrote only at the spur of necessity. \"For\r\nMatthew, after preaching to Hebrews, when about to go also to others,\r\ncommitted to writing in his native tongue the Gospel that bears his\r\nname; and so by his writing supplied, for those whom he was leaving, the\r\nloss of his presence.\" The value of this tradition, which may be based\r\non Papias, who certainly reported that \"Matthew compiled the Oracles (of\r\nthe Lord) in Hebrew,\" can be estimated only in connexion with the study\r\nof the Gospel itself (see below). No historical use can be made of the\r\nartificial story, in _Sanhedrin_ 43a, that Matthew was condemned to\r\ndeath by a Jewish court (see Laihle, _Christ in the Talmud_, 71 seq.).\r\nAccording to the Gnostic Heracleon, quoted by Clement of Alexandria\r\n(_Strom._ iv. 9), Matthew died a natural death. The tradition as to his\r\nascetic diet (in Clem. Alex. _Paedag._ ii. 16) maybe due to confusion\r\nwith Matthias (cf. _Mart. Matthaei_, i.). The earliest legend as to his\r\nlater labours, one of Syrian origin, places them in the Parthian\r\nkingdom, where it represents him as dying a natural death at Hierapolis\r\n(= Mabog on the Euphrates). This agrees with his legend as known to\r\nAmbrose and Paulinus of Nola, and is the most probable in itself. The\r\nlegends which make him work with Andrew among the Anthropophagi near the\r\nBlack Sea, or again in Ethiopia (Rufinus, and Socrates, _H.E._ i. 19),\r\nare due to confusion with Matthias, who from the first was associated in\r\nhis Acts with Andrew (see M. Bonnet, _Acta Apost. apocr._, 1808, II. i.\r\n65). Another legend, his _Martyrium_, makes him labour and suffer in\r\nMysore. He is commemorated as a martyr by the Greek Church on the 16th\r\nof November, and by the Roman on the 21st of September, the scene of his\r\nmartyrdom being placed in Ethiopia. The Latin Breviary also affirms that\r\nhis body was afterwards translated to Salerno, where it is said to lie\r\nin the church built by Robert Guiscard. In Christian art (following\r\nJerome) the Evangelist Matthew is generally symbolized by the \"man\" in\r\nthe imagery of Ezek. i. 10, Rev. iv. 7.\r\n\r\n  For the historical Matthew, see _Ency. Bibl._ and Zahn, _Introd. to\r\n  New Test._, ii. 506 seq., 522 seq. For his legends, as under MARK.\r\n       (J. V. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEW, TOBIAS, or TOBIE (1546-1628), archbishop of York, was the son\r\nof Sir John Matthew of Ross in Herefordshire, and of his wife Eleanor\r\nCrofton of Ludlow. He was born at Bristol in 1546. He was educated at\r\nWells, and then in succession at University College and Christ Church,\r\nOxford. He proceeded B.A. in 1564, and M.A. in 1566. He attracted the\r\nfavourable notice of Queen Elizabeth, and his rise was steady though not\r\nvery rapid. He was public orator in 1569, president of St John's\r\nCollege, Oxford, in 1572, dean of Christ Church in 1576, vice-chancellor\r\nof the university in 1579, dean of Durham in 1583, bishop of Durham in\r\n1595, and archbishop of York in 1606. In 1581 he had a controversy with\r\nthe Jesuit Edmund Campion, and published at Oxford his arguments in 1638\r\nunder the title, _Piissimi et eminentissimi viri Tobiae Matthew,\r\narchiepiscopi olim Eboracencis concio apologetica adversus Campianam_.\r\nWhile in the north he was active in forcing the recusants to conform to\r\nthe Church of England, preaching hundreds of sermons and carrying out\r\nthorough visitations. During his later years he was to some extent in\r\nopposition to the administration of James I. He was exempted from\r\nattendance in the parliament of 1625 on the ground of age and\r\ninfirmities, and died on the 29th of March 1628. His wife, Frances, was\r\nthe daughter of William Barlow, bishop of Chichester.\r\n\r\nHis son, SIR TOBIAS, or TOBIE, MATTHEW (1577-1655), is remembered as the\r\ncorrespondent and friend of Francis Bacon. He was educated at Christ\r\nChurch, and was early attached to the court, serving in the embassy at\r\nParis. His debts and dissipations were a great source of sorrow to his\r\nfather, from whom he is known to have received at different times\r\n£14,000, the modern equivalent of which is much larger. He was chosen\r\nmember for Newport in Cornwall in the parliament of 1601, and member for\r\nSt Albans in 1604. Before this time he had become the intimate friend of\r\nBacon, whom he replaced as member for St Albans. When peace was made\r\nwith Spain, on the accession of James I., he wished to travel abroad.\r\nHis family, who feared his conversion to Roman Catholicism, opposed his\r\nwish, but he promised not to go beyond France. When once safe out of\r\nEngland he broke his word and went to Italy. The persuasion of some of\r\nhis countrymen in Florence, one of whom is said to have been the Jesuit\r\nRobert Parsons, and a story he heard of the miraculous liquefaction of\r\nthe blood of San Januarius at Naples, led to his conversion in 1606.\r\nWhen he returned to England he was imprisoned, and many efforts were\r\nmade to obtain his reconversion without success. He would not take the\r\noath of allegiance to the king. In 1608 he was exiled, and remained out\r\nof England for ten years, mostly in Flanders and Spain. He returned in\r\n1617, but went abroad again in 1619. His friends obtained his leave to\r\nreturn in 1621. At home he was known as the intimate friend of Gondomar,\r\nthe Spanish ambassador. In 1623 he was sent to join Prince Charles,\r\nafterwards Charles I., at Madrid, and was knighted on the 23rd of\r\nOctober of that year. He remained in England till 1640, when he was\r\nfinally driven abroad by the parliament, which looked upon him as an\r\nagent of the pope. He died in the English college in Ghent on the 13th\r\nof October 1655. In 1618 he published an Italian translation of Bacon's\r\nessays. The \"Essay on Friendship\" was written for him. He was also the\r\nauthor of a translation of _The Confessions of the Incomparable Doctor\r\nSt Augustine_, which led him into controversy. His correspondence was\r\npublished in London in 1660.\r\n\r\n  For the father, see John Le Neve's _Fasti ecclesiae anglicanae_\r\n  (London, 1716), and Anthony Wood's _Athenae oxonienses_.

The indications of the use of this Gospel in the two\r\nor three generations following the Apostolic Age (see GOSPEL) are more\r\nplentiful than of any of the others. Throughout the history of the\r\nChurch, also, it has held a place second to none of the Gospels alike in\r\npublic instruction and in the private reading of Christians. The reasons\r\nfor its having impressed itself in this way and become thus familiar are\r\nin large part to be found in the characteristics noticed below. But in\r\naddition there has been from an early time the belief that it was the\r\nwork of one of those publicans whose heart Jesus touched and of whose\r\ncall to follow Him the three Synoptics contain an interesting account,\r\nbut who is identified as Matthew (q.v.) only in this one (Matt. ix. 9-13\r\n= Mark ii. 13-17 = Luke v. 27-32).\r\n\r\n1. _The Connexion of our Greek Gospel of Matthew with the Apostle whose\r\nname it bears._--The earliest reference to a writing by Matthew occurs\r\nin a fragment taken by Eusebius from the same work of Papias from which\r\nhe has given an account of the composition of a record by Mark (Euseb.\r\n_Hist. Eccl._ iii. 39; see MARK, GOSPEL OF ST). The statement about\r\nMatthew is much briefer and is harder to interpret. In spite of much\r\ncontroversy, the same measure of agreement as to its meaning cannot be\r\nsaid to have been attained. This is the fragment: \"Matthew, however, put\r\ntogether and wrote down the Oracles ([Greek: ta logia synegrapsen]) in\r\nthe Hebrew language, and each man interpreted them as he was able.\"\r\nWhether \"the elder\" referred to in the passage on Mark, or some other\r\nlike authority, was the source of this statement also does not appear;\r\nbut it is probable that this was the case from the context in which\r\nEusebius gives it. Conservative writers on the Gospels have frequently\r\nmaintained that the writing here referred to was virtually the Hebrew\r\noriginal of our Greek Gospel which bears his name. And it is indeed\r\nlikely that Papias himself closely associated the latter with the Hebrew\r\n(or Aramaic) work by Matthew, of which he had been told, since the\r\ntraditional connexion of this Greek Gospel with Matthew can hardly have\r\nbegun later than this time. It is reasonable also to suppose that there\r\nwas some ground for it. The description, however, of what Matthew did\r\nsuits better the making of a collection of Christ's discourses and\r\nsayings than the composition of a work corresponding in form and\r\ncharacter to our Gospel of Matthew.\r\n\r\nThe next reference in Christian literature to a Gospel-record by Matthew\r\nis that of Irenaeus in his famous passage on the four Gospels (_Adv.\r\nhaer._ iii. i. r). He says that it was written in Hebrew; but in all\r\nprobability he regarded the Greek Gospel, which stood first in his, as\r\nit does in our, enumeration, as in the strict sense a translation of the\r\nApostle's work; and this was the view of it universally taken till the\r\n16th century, when some of the scholars of the Reformation maintained\r\nthat the Greek Gospel itself was by Matthew.\r\n\r\nThe actual phenomena, however, of this Gospel, and of its relation to\r\nsources that have been used in it, cannot be explained consistently with\r\neither of the two views just mentioned. It is a composite work in which\r\ntwo chief sources, known in Greek to the author of our present Gospel,\r\nhave, together with some other matter, been combined. It is\r\ninconceivable that one of the Twelve should have proceeded in this way\r\nin giving an account of Christ's ministry. One of the chief documents,\r\nhowever, here referred to seems to correspond in character with the\r\ndescription given in Papias' fragment of a record of the compilation of\r\n\"the divine utterances\" made by Matthew; and the use made of it in our\r\nfirst Gospel may explain the connexion of this Apostle's name with it.\r\nIn the Gospel of Luke also, it is true, this same source has been used\r\nfor the teaching of Jesus. But the original Aramaic Logian document may\r\nhave been more largely reproduced in our Greek Matthew. Indeed, in the\r\ncase of one important passage (v. 17-48) this is suggested by a\r\ncomparison with Luke itself, and there are one or two others where from\r\nthe character of the matter it seems not improbable, especially vi. 1-18\r\nand xxiii. 1-5, 7b-10, 15-22. On the whole, as will be seen below, what\r\nappears to be a Palestinian form of the Gospel-tradition is most fully\r\nrepresented in this Gospel; but in many instances at least this may well\r\nbe due to some other cause than the use of the original Logian document.\r\n\r\n2. _The Plan on which the Contents is arranged._--In two respects the\r\narrangement of the book itself is significant.\r\n\r\n  (a) As to the general outline in the first half of the account of the\r\n  Galilean ministry (iv. 23-xi. 30). Immediately after relating the call\r\n  of the first four disciples (iv. 18-22) the evangelist gives in iv. 23\r\n  a comprehensive summary of Christ's work in Galilee under its two\r\n  chief aspects, teaching and healing. In the sequel both these are\r\n  illustrated. First, he gives in the Sermon on the Mount (v.-vii.) a\r\n  considerable body of teaching, of the kind required by the disciples\r\n  of Jesus generally, and a large portion of which probably also stood\r\n  not far from the beginning of the Logian document. After this he turns\r\n  to the other aspect. Up to this point he has mentioned no miracle. He\r\n  now describes a number in succession, introducing all but the first of\r\n  those told between Mark i. 23 and ii. 12, and also four specially\r\n  remarkable ones, which occurred a good deal later according to Mark's\r\n  order (Matt. viii. 23-34 = Mark iv. 35-v. 20; Matt. ix. 18-26 = Mark\r\n  v. 21-43); and he also adds some derived from another source, or other\r\n  sources (viii. 5-13; ix. 27-34). Then, after another general\r\n  description at ix. 35, similar to that at iv. 23, he brings strikingly\r\n  before us the needs of the masses of the people and Christ's\r\n  compassion for them, and so introduces the mission of the Twelve\r\n  (which again occurs later according to Mark's order, viz. at vi. 7\r\n  seq.), whereby the ministry both of teaching and of healing was\r\n  further extended (ix. 36-x. 42). Finally, the message of John the\r\n  Baptist, and the reply of Jesus, and the reflections that follow\r\n  (xi.), bring out the significance of the preceding narrative. It\r\n  should be observed that examples have been given of every kind of\r\n  mighty work referred to in the reply of Jesus to the messengers of the\r\n  Baptist; and that in the discourse which follows their departure the\r\n  perversity and unbelief of the people generally are condemned, and the\r\n  faith of the humble-minded is contrasted therewith. The greater part\r\n  of the matter from ix. 37 to end of xi. is taken from the Logian\r\n  document. After this point, i.e. from xii. 1 onwards, the first\r\n  evangelist follows Mark almost step by step down to the point (Mark\r\n  xvi. 8), after which Mark's Gospel breaks off, and another ending has\r\n  been supplied; and gives in substance almost the whole of Mark's\r\n  contents, with the exception that he passes over the few narratives\r\n  that he has (as we have seen) placed earlier. At the same time he\r\n  brings in additional matter in connexion with most of the Marcan\r\n  sections.\r\n\r\n  (b) With the accounts of the words of Jesus spoken on certain\r\n  occasions, which our first evangelist found given in one or another of\r\n  his sources, he has combined other pieces, taken from other parts of\r\n  the same source or from different sources, which seemed to him\r\n  connected in subject, e.g. into the discourse spoken on a mountain,\r\n  when crowds from all parts were present, given in the Logian document,\r\n  he has introduced some pieces which, as we infer from Luke, stood\r\n  separately in that document (cf. Matt. vi. 19-21 with Luke xii. 33,\r\n  34; Matt. vi. 22, 23 with Luke xi. 34-36; Matt. vi. 24 with Luke xvi.\r\n  13; Matt. vi. 25-34 with Luke xii. 22-32; Matt. vii. 7-11 with Luke\r\n  xi. 9-13). Again, the address to the Twelve in Mark vi. 7-11, which in\r\n  Matthew is combined with an address to disciples, from the Logian\r\n  document, is connected by Luke with the sending out of seventy\r\n  disciples (Luke x. 1-16). Our first evangelist has also added here\r\n  various other sayings (Matt. x. 17-39, 42). Again, with the Marcan\r\n  account of the charge of collusion with Satan and Christ's reply (Mark\r\n  iii. 22-30), the first evangelist (xii. 24-45) combines the parallel\r\n  account in the Logian document and adds Christ's reply to another\r\n  attack (Luke xi. 14-16, 17-26, 29-32). These are some examples. He has\r\n  in all in this manner constructed eight discourses or collections of\r\n  sayings, into which the greater part of Christ's teaching is gathered:\r\n  (1) On the character of the heirs of the kingdom (v.-vii.); (2) The\r\n  Mission address (x.); (3) Teaching suggested by the message of John\r\n  the Baptist (xi.); (4) The reply to an accusation and a challenge\r\n  (xii. 22-45); (5) The teaching by parables (xiii.); (6) On offences\r\n  (xviii.); (7) Concerning the Scribes and Pharisees (xxiii.); (8) On\r\n  the Last Things (xxiv., xxv.). In this arrangement of his material the\r\n  writer has in many instances disregarded chronological considerations.\r\n  But his documents also gave only very imperfect indications of the\r\n  occasions of many of the utterances; and the result of his method of\r\n  procedure has been to give us an exceedingly effective representation\r\n  of the teaching of Jesus.\r\n\r\n  In the concluding verses of the Gospel, where the original Marcan\r\n  parallel is wanting, the evangelist may still have followed in part\r\n  that document while making additions as before. The account of the\r\n  silencing of the Roman guard by the chief priests is the sequel to the\r\n  setting of this guard and their presence at the Resurrection, which at\r\n  an earlier point arc peculiar to Matthew (xxvii. 62-66, xxviii. 4).\r\n  And, further, this matter seems to belong to the same cycle of\r\n  tradition as the story of Pilate's wife and his throwing the guilt of\r\n  the Crucifixion of Jesus upon the Jews, and the testimony borne by\r\n  the Roman guard (as well as the centurion) who kept watch by the cross\r\n  (xxvii. 15-26, 54), all which also are peculiar to this Gospel. It\r\n  cannot but seem probable that these are legendary additions which had\r\n  arisen through the desire to commend the Gospel to the Romans.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, the meeting of Jesus with the disciples in Galilee\r\n  (Matt. xxviii. 16 seq.) is the natural sequel to the message to them\r\n  related in Mark xvi. 7, as well as in Matt, xxviii. 7. Again, the\r\n  commission to them to preach throughout the world is supported by Luke\r\n  xxiv. 47, and by the present ending of Mark (xvi. 15), though neither\r\n  of these mention Galilee as the place where it was given. The\r\n  baptismal formula in Matt. xxviii. 19, is, however, peculiar, and in\r\n  view of its non-occurrence in the Acts and Epistles of the New\r\n  Testament must be regarded as probably an addition in accordance with\r\n  Church usage at the time the Gospel was written.\r\n\r\n3. _The Palestinian Element._--Teaching is preserved in this Gospel\r\nwhich would have peculiar interest and be specially required in the home\r\nof Judaism. The best examples of this are the passages already referred\r\nto near end of § 1, as probably derived from the Logian document. There\r\nare, besides, a good many turns of expression and sayings peculiar to\r\nthis Gospel which have a Semitic cast, or which suggest a point of view\r\nthat would be natural to Palestinian Christians, e.g. \"kingdom of\r\nheaven\" frequently for \"kingdom of God\"; xiii. 52 (\"every scribe\");\r\nxxiv. 20 (\"neither on a Sabbath\"). See also v. 35 and xix. 9; x. 5, 23.\r\nAgain, several of the quotations which are peculiar to this Gospel are\r\nnot taken from the LXX., as those in the other Gospels and in the\r\ncorresponding contexts in this Gospel commonly are, but are wholly or\r\npartly independent renderings from the Hebrew (ii. 6, 15, 18; viii. 17,\r\nxii. 17-21, &c.). Once more, there is somewhat more parallelism between\r\nthe fragments of the Gospel according to the Hebrews and this Gospel\r\nthan is the case with Luke, not to say Mark.\r\n\r\n4. _Doctrinal Character._--In this Gospel, more decidedly than in either\r\nof the other two Synoptics, there is a doctrinal point of view from\r\nwhich the whole history is regarded. Certain aspects which are of\r\nprofound significance are dwelt upon, and this without there being any\r\ngreat difference between this Gospel and the two other Synoptics in\r\nrespect to the facts recorded or the beliefs implied. The effect is\r\nproduced partly by the comments of the evangelist, which especially take\r\nthe form of citations from the Old Testament; partly by the frequency\r\nwith which certain expressions are used, and the prominence that is\r\ngiven in this and other ways to particular traits and topics.\r\n\r\nHe sets forth the restriction of the mission of Jesus during His life on\r\nearth to the people of Israel in a way which suggests at first sight a\r\nspirit of Jewish exclusiveness. But there are various indications that\r\nthis is not the true explanation. In particular the evangelist brings\r\nout more strongly than either Mark or Luke the national rejection of\r\nJesus, while the Gospel ends with the commission of Jesus to His\r\ndisciples after His resurrection to \"make disciples of all the peoples.\"\r\nOne may divine in all this an intention to \"justify the ways of God\" to\r\nthe Jew, by proving that God in His faithfulness to His ancient people\r\nhad given them the first opportunity of salvation through Christ, but\r\nthat now their national privilege had been rightly forfeited. He was\r\nalso specially concerned to show that prophecy is fulfilled in the life\r\nand work of Jesus, but the conception of this fulfilment which is\r\npresented to us is a large one; it is to be seen not merely in\r\nparticular events or features of Christ's ministry, but in the whole new\r\ndispensation, new relations between God and men, and new rules of\r\nconduct which Christ has introduced. The divine meaning of the work of\r\nJesus is thus made apparent, while of the majesty and glory of His\r\nperson a peculiarly strong impression is conveyed.\r\n\r\nSome illustrations in detail of these points are subjoined. Where there\r\nare parallels in the other Gospels they should be compared and the words\r\nin Matthew noted which in many instances serve to emphasize the points\r\nin question.\r\n\r\n  (a) _The Ministry of Jesus among the Jewish People as their promised\r\n  Messiah, their rejection of Him, and the extension of the Gospel to\r\n  the Gentiles._ The mission to Israel: Matt. i. 21; iv. 23 (note in\r\n  these passages the use of [Greek: ho laos], which here, as generally\r\n  in Matthew, denotes the chosen nation), ix. 33, 35, xv. 31. For the\r\n  rule limiting the work of Jesus while on earth see xv. 24 (and note\r\n  [Greek: ixelthousa] in verse 22, which implies that Jesus had not\r\n  himself entered the heathen borders), and for a similar rule\r\n  prescribed to the disciples, x. 5, 6 and 23.\r\n\r\n  The rejection of Jesus by the people in Galilee, xi. 21; xiii. 13-15,\r\n  and by the heads of \"the nation,\" xxvi. 3, 47 and by \"the whole\r\n  nation,\" xxvii. 25; their condemnation xxiii. 38.\r\n\r\n  Mercy to the Gentiles and the punishment of \"the sons of the kingdom\"\r\n  is foretold viii. 11, 12. The commission to go and convert Gentile\r\n  peoples ([Greek: ethnê]) is given after Christ's resurrection (xxviii.\r\n  19).\r\n\r\n  (b) _The Fulfilment of Prophecy._--In the birth and childhood of\r\n  Jesus, i. 23; ii. 6, 15, 18, 23. By these citations attention is drawn\r\n  to the lowliness of the beginnings of the Saviour's life, the\r\n  unexpected and secret manner of His appearing, the dangers to which\r\n  from the first He was exposed and from which He escaped.\r\n\r\n  The ministry of Christ's forerunner, iii. 3. (The same prophecy, Isa.\r\n  xl. 3, is also quoted in the other Gospels.)\r\n\r\n  The ministry of Jesus. The quotations serve to bring out the\r\n  significance of important events, especially such as were\r\n  turning-points, and also to mark the broad features of Christ's life\r\n  and work, iv. 15, 16; viii. 17; xii. 18 seq.; xiii. 35; xxi. 5; xxvii.\r\n  9.\r\n\r\n  (c) _The Teaching on the Kingdom of God._--Note the collection of\r\n  parables \"of the Kingdom\" in xiii.; also the use of [Greek: hê\r\n  basileia] (\"the Kingdom\") without further definition as a term the\r\n  reference of which could not be misunderstood, especially in the\r\n  following phrases peculiar to this Gospel: [Greek: to euangelion tês\r\n  basileias] (\"the Gospel of the Kingdom\") iv. 23, ix. 35, xxiv. 14; and\r\n  [Greek: ho logos tês basileias] (\"the word of the kingdom\") xiii. 19.\r\n  The following descriptions of the kingdom, peculiar to this Gospel,\r\n  are also interesting [Greek: hê basileia tou patros autôn] (\"the\r\n  kingdom of their father\") xiii. 43 and [Greek: tou patros mou](\"of my\r\n  father\") xxvi. 29.\r\n\r\n  (d) _The Relation of the New Law to the Old._--Verses 17-48, cf. also,\r\n  addition at xxii. 40 and xix. 19b. Further, his use of [Greek:\r\n  dikaiosynê] (\"righteousness\") and [Greek: dikaios](\"righteous\")\r\n  (specially frequent in this Gospel) is such as to connect the New with\r\n  the Old; the standard in mind is the law which \"fulfilled\" that\r\n  previously given.\r\n\r\n  (e) _The Christian Ecclesia._--Chap. xvi. 18, xviii. 17.\r\n\r\n  (f) _The Messianic Dignity and Glory of Jesus._--The narrative in i.\r\n  and ii. show the royalty of the new-born child. The title \"Son of\r\n  David\" occurs with special frequency in this Gospel. The following\r\n  instances are without parallels in the other Gospels: ix. 27; xii. 23;\r\n  xv. 22; xxi. 9; xxi. 15. The title \"Son of God\" is also used with\r\n  somewhat greater frequency than in Mark and Luke: ii. 15; xiv. 33;\r\n  xvi. 16; xxii. 2 seq. (where it is implied); xxvii. 40, 43.\r\n\r\n  The thought of the future coming of Christ, and in particular of the\r\n  judgment to be executed by Him then, is much more prominent in this\r\n  Gospel than in the others. Some of the following predictions are\r\n  peculiar to it, while in several others there are additional touches:\r\n  vii. 22, 23; x. 23, 32, 33; xiii. 39-43; xvi. 27, 28; xix. 28; xxiv.\r\n  3, 27, 30, 31, 37, 39; xxv. 31-46; xxvi. 64.\r\n\r\n  The majesty of Christ is also impressed upon us by the signs at His\r\n  crucifixion, some of which are related only in this Gospel, xxvii.\r\n  51-53, and by the sublime vision of the Risen Christ at the close,\r\n  xxviii. 16-20.\r\n\r\n(5) _Time of Composition and Readers addressed._--The signs of dogmatic\r\nreflection in this Gospel point to its having been composed somewhat\r\nlate in the 1st century, probably after Luke's Gospel, and this is in\r\naccord with the conclusion that some insertions had been made in the\r\nMarcan document used by this evangelist which were not in that used by\r\nLuke (see LUKE, GOSPEL OF ST). We may assign A.D. 80-100 as a probable\r\ntime for the composition.\r\n\r\nThe author was in all probability a Jew by race, and he would seem to\r\nhave addressed himself especially to Jewish readers; but they were Jews\r\nof the Dispersion. For although he was in specially close touch with\r\nPalestine, either personally or through the sources at his command, or\r\nboth, his book was composed in Greek by the aid of Greek documents.\r\n\r\n  See commentaries by Th. Zahn (1903) and W. C. Allen (in the series of\r\n  International Critical Commentaries, 1907); also books on the Four\r\n  Gospels or the Synoptic Gospels cited at the end of GOSPEL.\r\n       (V. H. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEW CANTACUZENUS, Byzantine emperor, was the son of John VI.\r\nCantacuzenus (q.v.). In return for the support he gave to his father\r\nduring his struggle with John V. he was allowed to annex part of Thrace\r\nunder his own dominion and in 1353 was proclaimed joint emperor. From\r\nhis Thracian principality he levied several wars against the Servians.\r\nAn attack which he prepared in 1350 was frustrated by the defection of\r\nhis Turkish auxiliaries. In 1357 he was captured by his enemies, who\r\ndelivered him to the rival emperor, John V. Compelled to abdicate, he\r\nwithdrew to a monastery, where he busied himself with writing\r\ncommentaries on the Scriptures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEW OF PARIS (d. 1259), English monk and chronicler known to us only\r\nthrough his voluminous writings. In spite of his surname, and of his\r\nknowledge of the French language, his attitude towards foreigners\r\nattests that he was of English birth. He may have studied at Paris in\r\nhis youth, but the earliest fact which he records of himself is his\r\nadmission as a monk at St Albans in the year 1217. His life was mainly\r\nspent in this religious house. In 1248, however, he was sent to Norway\r\nas the bearer of a message from Louis IX. of France to Haakon VI.; he\r\nmade himself so agreeable to the Norwegian sovereign that he was\r\ninvited, a little later, to superintend the reformation of the\r\nBenedictine monastery of St Benet Holme at Trondhjem. Apart from these\r\nmissions, his activities were devoted to the composition of history, a\r\npursuit for which the monks of St Albans had long been famous. Matthew\r\nedited anew the works of Abbot John de Cella and Roger of Wendover,\r\nwhich in their altered form constitute the first part of his most\r\nimportant work, the _Chronica majora_. From 1235, the point at which\r\nWendover dropped his pen, Matthew continued the history on the plan\r\nwhich his predecessors had followed. He derived much of his information\r\nfrom the letters of important personages, which he sometimes inserts,\r\nbut much more from conversation with the eye-witnesses of events. Among\r\nhis informants were Earl Richard of Cornwall and Henry III. With the\r\nlatter he appears to have been on terms of intimacy. The king knew that\r\nMatthew was writing a history, and showed some anxiety that it should be\r\nas exact as possible. In 1257, in the course of a week's visit to St\r\nAlbans, Henry kept the chronicler beside him night and day, \"and guided\r\nmy pen,\" says Paris, \"with much good will and diligence.\" It is\r\ntherefore curious that the _Chronica majora_ should give so unfavourable\r\nan account of the king's policy. Luard supposes that Matthew never\r\nintended his work to see the light in its present form, and many\r\npassages of the autograph have against them the note _offendiculum_,\r\nwhich shows that the writer understood the danger which he ran. On the\r\nother hand, unexpurgated copies were made in Matthew's lifetime; though\r\nthe offending passages are duly omitted or softened in his abridgment of\r\nhis longer work, the _Historia Anglorum_ (written about 1253), the real\r\nsentiments of the author must have been an open secret. In any case\r\nthere is no ground for the old theory that he was an official\r\nhistoriographer.\r\n\r\n  Matthew Paris was unfortunate in living at a time when English\r\n  politics were peculiarly involved and tedious. His talent is for\r\n  narrative and description. Though he took a keen interest in the\r\n  personal side of politics he has no claim to be considered a judge of\r\n  character. His appreciations of his contemporaries throw more light on\r\n  his own prejudices than on their aims and ideas. His work is always\r\n  vigorous, but he imputes motives in the spirit of a partisan who never\r\n  pauses to weigh the evidence or to take a comprehensive view of the\r\n  situation. His redeeming feature is his generous admiration for\r\n  strength of character, even when it goes along with a policy of which\r\n  he disapproves. Thus he praises Grosseteste, while he denounces\r\n  Grosseteste's scheme of monastic reform. Matthew is a vehement\r\n  supporter of the monastic orders against their rivals, the secular\r\n  clergy and the mendicant friars. He is violently opposed to the court\r\n  and the foreign favourites. He despises the king as a statesman,\r\n  though for the man he has some kindly feeling. The frankness with\r\n  which he attacks the court of Rome for its exactions is remarkable;\r\n  so, too, is the intense nationalism which he displays in dealing with\r\n  this topic. His faults of presentment are more often due to\r\n  carelessness and narrow views than to deliberate purpose. But he is\r\n  sometimes guilty of inserting rhetorical speeches which are not only\r\n  fictitious, but also misleading as an account of the speaker's\r\n  sentiments. In other cases he tampers with the documents which he\r\n  inserts (as, for instance, with the text of Magna Carta). His\r\n  chronology is, for a contemporary, inexact; and he occasionally\r\n  inserts duplicate versions of the same incident in different places.\r\n  Hence he must always be rigorously checked where other authorities\r\n  exist and used with caution where he is our sole informant. None the\r\n  less, he gives a more vivid impression of his age than any other\r\n  English chronicler; and it is a matter for regret that his great\r\n  history breaks off in 1259, on the eve of the crowning struggle\r\n  between Henry III and the baronage.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The relation of Matthew Paris's work to those of John de\r\n  Cella and Roger of Wendover may best be studied in H. R. Luard's\r\n  edition of the _Chronica majora_ (7 vols., Rolls series, 1872-1883),\r\n  which contains valuable prefaces. The _Historia_ _Anglorum sive\r\n  historia minor_ (1067-1253) has been edited by F. Madden (3 vols.,\r\n  Rolls series, 1866-1869). Matthew Paris is often confused with\r\n  \"Matthew of Westminster,\" the reputed author of the _Flores\r\n  historiarum_ edited by H. R. Luard (3 vols., Rolls series, 1890). This\r\n  work, compiled by various hands, is an edition of Matthew Paris, with\r\n  continuations extending to 1326. Matthew Paris also wrote a life of\r\n  Edmund Rich (q.v.), which is probably the work printed in W. Wallace's\r\n  _St Edmund of Canterbury_ (London, 1893) pp. 543-588, though this is\r\n  attributed by the editor to the monk Eustace; _Vitae abbatum S Albani_\r\n  (up to 1225) which have been edited by W. Watts (1640, &c.); and\r\n  (possibly) the _Abbreviatio chronicorum_ (1000-1255), edited by F.\r\n  Madden, in the third volume of the _Historia Anglorum_. On the value\r\n  of Matthew as an historian see F. Liebermann in G. H. Pertz's\r\n  _Scriptores_ xxviii. pp. 74-106; A. Jessopp's _Studies by a Recluse_\r\n  (London, 1893); H. Plehn's _Politische Character Matheus Parisiensis_\r\n  (Leipzig, 1897).     (H. W. C. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEW OF WESTMINSTER, the name of an imaginary person who was long\r\nregarded as the author of the _Flores Historiarum_. The error was first\r\ndiscovered in 1826 by Sir F. Palgrave, who said that Matthew was \"a\r\nphantom who never existed,\" and later the truth of this statement was\r\ncompletely proved by H. R. Luard. The name appears to have been taken\r\nfrom that of Matthew of Paris, from whose _Chronica majora_ the earlier\r\npart of the work was mainly copied, and from Westminster, the abbey in\r\nwhich the work was partially written.\r\n\r\n  The _Flores historiarum_ is a Latin chronicle dealing with English\r\n  history from the creation to 1326, although some of the earlier\r\n  manuscripts end at 1306; it was compiled by various persons, and\r\n  written partly at St Albans and partly at Westminster. The part from\r\n  1306 to 1326 was written by Robert of Reading (d. 1325) and another\r\n  Westminster monk. Except for parts dealing with the reign of Edward I.\r\n  its value is not great. It was first printed by Matthew Parker,\r\n  archbishop of Canterbury, in 1567, and the best edition is the one\r\n  edited with introduction by H. R. Luard for the Rolls series (London,\r\n  1890). It has been translated into English by C. D. Yonge (London,\r\n  1853). See Luard's introduction, and C. Bémont in the _Revue critique\r\n  d'histoire_ (Paris, 1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEWS, STANLEY (1824-1889), American jurist, was born in Cincinnati,\r\nOhio, on the 21st of July 1824. He graduated from Kenyon College in\r\n1840, studied law, and in 1842 was admitted to the bar of Maury county,\r\nTennessee. In 1844 he became assistant prosecuting attorney of Hamilton\r\ncounty, Ohio; and in 1846-1849 edited a short-lived anti-slavery paper,\r\nthe _Cincinnati Herald_. He was clerk of the Ohio House of\r\nRepresentatives in 1848-1849, a judge of common pleas of Hamilton county\r\nin 1850-1853, state senator in 1856-1858, and U.S. district-attorney for\r\nthe southern district of Ohio in 1858-1861. First a Whig and then a\r\nFree-Soiler, he joined the Republican party in 1861. After the outbreak\r\nof the Civil War he was commissioned a lieutenant of the 23rd Ohio, of\r\nwhich Rutherford B. Hayes was major; but saw service only with the 57th\r\nOhio, of which he was colonel, and with a brigade which he commanded in\r\nthe Army of the Cumberland. He resigned from the army in 1863, and was\r\njudge of the Cincinnati superior court in 1863-1864. He was a Republican\r\npresidential elector in 1864 and 1868. In 1872 he joined the Liberal\r\nRepublican movement, and was temporary chairman of the Cincinnati\r\nconvention which nominated Horace Greeley for the presidency, but in the\r\ncampaign he supported Grant. In 1877, as counsel before the Electoral\r\nCommission, he opened the argument for the Republican electors of\r\nFlorida and made the principal argument for the Republican electors of\r\nOregon. In March of the same year he succeeded John Sherman as senator\r\nfrom Ohio, and served until March 1879. In 1881 President Hayes\r\nnominated him as associate justice of the Supreme Court, to succeed Noah\r\nH. Swayne; there was much opposition, especially in the press, to this\r\nappointment, because Matthews had been a prominent railway and\r\ncorporation lawyer and had been one of the Republican \"visiting\r\nstatesmen\" who witnessed the canvass of the vote of Louisiana[1] in\r\n1876; and the nomination had not been approved when the session of\r\nCongress expired. Matthews was renominated by President Garfield on the\r\n15th of March, and the nomination was confirmed by the Senate (22 for,\r\n21 against) on the 12th of May. He was an honest, impartial and\r\nconscientious judge. He died in Washington, on the 22nd of March 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] It seems certain that Matthews and Charles Foster of Ohio gave\r\n    their written promise that Hayes, if elected, would recognize the\r\n    Democratic governors in Louisiana and South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHIAE, AUGUST HEINRICH (1769-1835), German classical scholar, was\r\nborn at Göttingen, on the 25th of December 1769, and educated at the\r\nuniversity. He then spent some years as a tutor in Amsterdam. In 1798 he\r\nreturned to Germany, and in 1802 was appointed director of the\r\nFriedrichsgymnasium at Altenburg, which post he held till his death, on\r\nthe 6th of January 1835. Of his numerous important works the best-known\r\nare his _Greek Grammar_ (3rd ed., 1835), translated into English by E.\r\nV. Blomfield (5th ed., by J. Kenrick, 1832), his edition of _Euripides_\r\n(9 vols., 1813-1829), _Grundriss der Geschichte der griechischen und\r\nrömischen Litteratur_ (3rd ed., 1834, Eng. trans., Oxford, 1841)\r\n_Lehrbuch für den ersten Unterricht in der Philosophie_ (3rd ed., 1833),\r\n_Encyklopädie und Methodologie der Philologie_ (1835). His _Life_ was\r\nwritten by his son Constantin (1845).\r\n\r\nHis brother, FRIEDRICH CHRISTIAN MATTHIAE (1763-1822), rector of the\r\nFrankfort gymnasium, published valuable editions of Seneca's _Letters_,\r\nAratus, and Dionysius Periegetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHIAS, the disciple elected by the primitive Christian community to\r\nfill the place in the Twelve vacated by Judas Iscariot (Acts i. 21-26).\r\nNothing further is recorded of him in the New Testament. Eusebius\r\n(_Hist. Eccl._, I. xii.) says he was, like his competitor, Barsabas\r\nJustus, one of the seventy, and the Syriac version of Eusebius calls him\r\nthroughout not Matthias but Tolmai, i.e. Bartholomew, without confusing\r\nhim with the Bartholomew who was originally one of the Twelve, and is\r\noften identified with the Nathanael mentioned in the Fourth Gospel\r\n(_Expository Times_, ix. 566). Clement of Alexandria says some\r\nidentified him with Zacchaeus, the Clementine _Recognitions_ identify\r\nhim with Barnabas, Hilgenfeld thinks he is the same as Nathanael.\r\n\r\n  Various works--a Gospel, Traditions and Apocryphal Words--were\r\n  ascribed to him; and there is also extant _The Acts of Andrew and\r\n  Matthias_, which places his activity in \"the city of the cannibals\" in\r\n  Ethiopia. Clement of Alexandria quotes two sayings from the\r\n  Traditions: (1) Wonder at the things before you (suggesting, like\r\n  Plato, that wonder is the first step to new knowledge); (2) If an\r\n  elect man's neighbour sin, the elect man has sinned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHIAS (1557-1619), Roman emperor, son of the emperor Maximilian II.\r\nand Maria, daughter of the emperor Charles V., was born in Vienna, on\r\nthe 24th of February 1557. Educated by the diplomatist O. G. de Busbecq,\r\nhe began his public life in 1577, soon after his father's death, when he\r\nwas invited to assume the governorship of the Netherlands, then in the\r\nmidst of the long struggle with Spain. He eagerly accepted this\r\ninvitation, although it involved a definite breach with his Spanish\r\nkinsman, Philip II., and entering Brussels in January 1578 was named\r\ngovernor-general; but he was merely a cipher, and only held the position\r\nfor about three years, returning to Germany in October 1581. Matthias\r\nwas appointed governor of Austria in 1593 by his brother, the emperor\r\nRudolph II.; and two years later, when another brother, the archduke\r\nErnest, died, he became a person of more importance as the eldest\r\nsurviving brother of the unmarried emperor. As governor of Austria\r\nMatthias continued the policy of crushing the Protestants, although\r\npersonally he appears to have been inclined to religious tolerance; and\r\nhe dealt with the rising of the peasants in 1595, in addition to\r\nrepresenting Rudolph at the imperial diets, and gaining some fame as a\r\nsoldier during the Turkish War. A few years later the discontent felt by\r\nthe members of the Habsburg family at the incompetence of the emperor\r\nbecame very acute, and the lead was taken by Matthias. Obtaining in May\r\n1605 a reluctant consent from his brother, he took over the conduct of\r\naffairs in Hungary, where a revolt had broken out, and was formally\r\nrecognized by the Habsburgs as their head in April 1606, and was\r\npromised the succession to the Empire. In June 1606 he concluded the\r\npeace of Vienna with the rebellious Hungarians, and was thus in a better\r\nposition to treat with the sultan, with whom peace was made in November.\r\nThis pacific policy was displeasing to Rudolph, who prepared to renew\r\nthe Turkish War; but having secured the support of the national party in\r\nHungary and gathered an army, Matthias forced his brother to cede to him\r\nthis kingdom, together with Austria and Moravia, both of which had\r\nthrown in their lot with Hungary (1608). The king of Hungary, as\r\nMatthias now became, was reluctantly compelled to grant religious\r\nliberty to the inhabitants of Austria. The strained relations which had\r\narisen between Rudolph and Matthias as a result of these proceedings\r\nwere temporarily improved, and a formal reconciliation took place in\r\n1610; but affairs in Bohemia soon destroyed this fraternal peace. In\r\nspite of the letter of majesty (_Majestätsbrief_) which the Bohemians\r\nhad extorted from Rudolph, they were very dissatisfied with their ruler,\r\nwhose troops were ravaging their land; and in 1611 they invited Matthias\r\nto come to their aid. Accepting this invitation, he inflicted another\r\nhumiliation upon his brother, and was crowned king of Bohemia in May\r\n1611. Rudolph, however, was successful in preventing the election of\r\nMatthias as German king, or king of the Romans, and when he died, in\r\nJanuary 1612, no provision had been made for a successor. Already king\r\nof Hungary and Bohemia, however, Matthias obtained the remaining\r\nhereditary dominions of the Habsburgs, and in June 1612 was crowned\r\nemperor, although the ecclesiastical electors favoured his younger\r\nbrother, the archduke Albert (1559-1621).\r\n\r\nThe short reign of the new emperor was troubled by the religious\r\ndissensions of Germany. His health became impaired and his indolence\r\nincreased, and he fell completely under the influence of Melchior Klesl\r\n(q.v.), who practically conducted the imperial business. By Klesl's\r\nadvice he took up an attitude of moderation and sought to reconcile the\r\ncontending religious parties; but the proceedings at the diet of\r\nRegensburg in 1613 proved the hopelessness of these attempts, while\r\ntheir author was regarded with general distrust. Meanwhile the younger\r\nHabsburgs, led by the emperor's brother, the archduke Maximilian, and\r\nhis cousin, Ferdinand, archduke of Styria, afterwards the emperor\r\nFerdinand II., disliking the peaceful policy of Klesl, had allied\r\nthemselves with the unyielding Roman Catholics, while the question of\r\nthe imperial succession was forcing its way to the front. In 1611\r\nMatthias had married his cousin Anna (d. 1618), daughter of the archduke\r\nFerdinand (d. 1595), but he was old and childless and the Habsburgs were\r\nanxious to retain his extensive possessions in the family. Klesl, on the\r\none hand, wished the settlement of the religious difficulties to precede\r\nany arrangement about the imperial succession; the Habsburgs, on the\r\nother, regarded the question of the succession as urgent and vital.\r\nMeanwhile the disputed succession to the duchies of Cleves and Jülich\r\nagain threatened a European war; the imperial commands were flouted in\r\nCologne and Aix-la-Chapelle, and the Bohemians were again becoming\r\ntroublesome. Having decided that Ferdinand should succeed Matthias as\r\nemperor, the Habsburgs had secured his election as king of Bohemia in\r\nJune 1617, but were unable to stem the rising tide of disorder in that\r\ncountry. Matthias and Klesl were in favour of concessions, but Ferdinand\r\nand Maximilian met this move by seizing and imprisoning Klesl. Ferdinand\r\nhad just secured his coronation as king of Hungary when there broke out\r\nin Bohemia those struggles which heralded the Thirty Years' War; and on\r\nthe 20th of March 1619 the emperor died at Vienna.\r\n\r\n  For the life and reign of Matthias the following works may be\r\n  consulted: J.

His tutors were the learned János Vitéz,\r\nbishop of Nagyvárad, whom he subsequently raised to the primacy, and the\r\nPolish humanist Gregory Sanocki. The precocious lad quickly mastered the\r\nGerman, Latin and principal Slavonic languages, frequently acting as his\r\nfather's interpreter at the reception of ambassadors. His military\r\ntraining proceeded under the eye of his father, whom he began to follow\r\non his campaigns when only twelve years of age. In 1453 he was created\r\ncount of Bistercze, and was knighted at the siege of Belgrade in 1454.\r\nThe same care for his welfare led his father to choose him a bride in\r\nthe powerful Cilli family, but the young Elizabeth died before the\r\nmarriage was consummated, leaving Matthias a widower at the age of\r\nfifteen. On the death of his father he was inveigled to Buda by the\r\nenemies of his house, and, on the pretext of being concerned in a purely\r\nimaginary conspiracy against Ladislaus V., was condemned to\r\ndecapitation, but was spared on account of his youth, and on the king's\r\ndeath fell into the hands of George Podebrad, governor of Bohemia, the\r\nfriend of the Hunyadis, in whose interests it was that a national king\r\nshould sit on the Magyar throne. Podebrad treated Matthias hospitably\r\nand affianced him with his daughter Catherine, but still detained him,\r\nfor safety's sake, in Prague, even after a Magyar deputation had\r\nhastened thither to offer the youth the crown. Matthias was the elect of\r\nthe Hungarian people, gratefully mindful of his father's services to the\r\nstate and inimical to all foreign candidates; and though an influential\r\nsection of the magnates, headed by the palatine László Garai and the\r\nvoivode of Transylvania, Miklós Ujlaki, who had been concerned in the\r\njudicial murder of Matthias's brother László, and hated the Hunyadis as\r\nsemi-foreign upstarts, were fiercely opposed to Matthias's election,\r\nthey were not strong enough to resist the manifest wish of the nation,\r\nsupported as it was by Matthias's uncle Mihály Szilágyi at the head of\r\n15,000 veterans. On the 24th of January 1458, 40,000 Hungarian noblemen,\r\nassembled on the ice of the frozen Danube, unanimously elected Matthias\r\nHunyadi king of Hungary, and on the 14th of February the new king made\r\nhis state entry into Buda.\r\n\r\nThe realm at this time was environed by perils. The Turks and the\r\nVenetians threatened it from the south, the emperor Frederick III. from\r\nthe west, and Casimir IV. of Poland from the north, both Frederick and\r\nCasimir claiming the throne. The Czech mercenaries under Giszkra held\r\nthe northern counties and from thence plundered those in the centre.\r\nMeanwhile Matthias's friends had only pacified the hostile dignitaries\r\nby engaging to marry the daughter of the palatine Garai to their\r\nnominee, whereas Matthias not unnaturally refused to marry into the\r\nfamily of one of his brother's murderers, and on the 9th of February\r\nconfirmed his previous nuptial contract with the daughter of George\r\nPodebrad, who shortly afterwards was elected king of Bohemia (March 2,\r\n1458). Throughout 1458 the struggle between the young king and the\r\nmagnates, reinforced by Matthias's own uncle and guardian Szilágyi, was\r\nacute. But Matthias, who began by deposing Garai and dismissing\r\nSzilágyi, and then proceeded to levy a tax, without the consent of the\r\nDiet, in order to hire mercenaries, easily prevailed. Nor did these\r\ncomplications prevent him from recovering the fortress of Galamboc from\r\nthe Turks, successfully invading Servia, and reasserting the suzerainty\r\nof the Hungarian crown over Bosnia. In the following year there was a\r\nfresh rebellion, when the emperor Frederick was actually crowned king by\r\nthe malcontents at Vienna-Neustadt (March 4, 1459); but Matthias drove\r\nhim out, and Pope Pius II. intervened so as to leave Matthias free to\r\nengage in a projected crusade against the Turks, which subsequent\r\npolitical complications, however, rendered impossible. From 1461 to 1465\r\nthe career of Matthias was a perpetual struggle punctuated by truces.\r\nHaving come to an understanding with his father-in-law Podebrad, he was\r\nable to turn his arms against the emperor Frederick, and in April 1462\r\nFrederick restored the holy crown for 60,000 ducats and was allowed to\r\nretain certain Hungarian counties with the title of king; in return for\r\nwhich concessions, extorted from Matthias by the necessity of coping\r\nwith a simultaneous rebellion of the Magyar noble in league with\r\nPodebrad's son Victorinus, the emperor recognized Matthias as the actual\r\nsovereign of Hungary. Only now was Matthias able to turn against the\r\nTurks, who were again threatening the southern provinces. He began by\r\ndefeating Ali Pasha, and then penetrated into Bosnia, and captured the\r\nnewly built fortress of Jajce after a long and obstinate defence (Dec.\r\n1463). On returning home he was crowned with the holy crown on the 29th\r\nof March 1464, and, after driving the Czechs out of his northern\r\ncounties, turned southwards again, this time recovering all the parts of\r\nBosnia which still remained in Turkish hands.\r\n\r\nA political event of the first importance now riveted his attention upon\r\nthe north. Podebrad, who had gained the throne of Bohemia with the aid\r\nof the Hussites and Utraquists, had long been in ill odour at Rome, and\r\nin 1465 Pope Paul II. determined to depose the semi-Catholic monarch.\r\nAll the neighbouring princes, the emperor, Casimir IV. of Poland and\r\nMatthias, were commanded in turn to execute the papal decree of\r\ndeposition, and Matthias gladly placed his army at the disposal of the\r\nHoly See. The war began on the 31st of May 1468, but, as early as the\r\n27th of February 1469, Matthias anticipated an alliance between George\r\nand Frederick by himself concluding an armistice with the former. On the\r\n3rd of May the Czech Catholics elected Matthias king of Bohemia, but\r\nthis was contrary to the wishes of both pope and emperor, who preferred\r\nto partition Bohemia. But now George discomfited all his enemies by\r\nsuddenly excluding his own son from the throne in favour of Ladislaus,\r\nthe eldest son of Casimir IV., thus skilfully enlisting Poland on his\r\nside. The sudden death of Podebrad on the 22nd of March 1471 led to\r\nfresh complications. At the very moment when Matthias was about to\r\nprofit by the disappearance of his most capable rival, another dangerous\r\nrebellion, headed by the primate and the chief dignitaries of the state,\r\nwith the object of placing Casimir, son of Casimir IV., on the throne,\r\nparalysed Matthias's foreign policy during the critical years 1470-1471.\r\nHe suppressed this domestic rebellion indeed, but in the meantime the\r\nPoles had invaded the Bohemian domains with 60,000 men, and when in 1474\r\nMatthias was at last able to take the field against them in order to\r\nraise the siege of Breslau, he was obliged to fortify himself in an\r\nentrenched camp, whence he so skilfully harried the enemy that the\r\nPoles, impatient to return to their own country, made peace at Breslau\r\n(Feb. 1475) on an _uti possidetis_ basis, a peace subsequently confirmed\r\nby the congress of Olmütz (July 1479). During the interval between these\r\npeaces, Matthias, in self-defence, again made war on the emperor,\r\nreducing Frederick to such extremities that he was glad to accept peace\r\non any terms. By the final arrangement made between the contending\r\nprinces, Matthias recognized Ladislaus as king of Bohemia proper in\r\nreturn for the surrender of Moravia, Silesia and Upper and Lower\r\nLusatia, hitherto component parts of the Czech monarchy, till he should\r\nhave redeemed them for 400,000 florins. The emperor promised to pay\r\nMatthias 100,000 florins as a war indemnity, and recognized him as the\r\nlegitimate king of Hungary on the understanding that he should succeed\r\nhim if he died without male issue, a contingency at this time somewhat\r\nimprobable, as Matthias, only three years previously (Dec. 15, 1476),\r\nhad married his third wife, Beatrice of Naples, daughter of Ferdinand of\r\nAragon.\r\n\r\nThe endless tergiversations and depredations of the emperor speedily\r\ninduced Matthias to declare war against him for the third time (1481),\r\nthe Magyar king conquering all the fortresses in Frederick's hereditary\r\ndomains. Finally, on the 1st of June 1485, at the head of 8000 veterans,\r\nhe made his triumphal entry into Vienna, which he henceforth made his\r\ncapital. Styria, Carinthia and Carniola were next subdued, and Trieste\r\nwas only saved by the intervention of the Venetians. Matthias\r\nconsolidated his position by alliances with the dukes of Saxony and\r\nBavaria, with the Swiss Confederation, and the archbishop of Salzburg,\r\nand was henceforth the greatest potentate in central Europe. His\r\nfar-reaching hand even extended to Italy. Thus, in 1480, when a Turkish\r\nfleet seized Otranto, Matthias, at the earnest solicitation of the pope,\r\nsent Balasz Magyar to recover the fortress, which surrendered to him on\r\nthe 10th of May 1481. Again in 1488, Matthias took Ancona under his\r\nprotection for a time and occupied it with a Hungarian garrison.\r\n\r\nThough Matthias's policy was so predominantly occidental that he soon\r\nabandoned his youthful idea of driving the Turks out of Europe, he at\r\nleast succeeded in making them respect Hungarian territory. Thus in 1479\r\na huge Turkish army, on its return home from ravaging Transylvania, was\r\nannihilated at Szászváros (Oct. 13), and in 1480 Matthias recaptured\r\nJajce, drove the Turks from Servia and erected two new military banates,\r\nJajce and Srebernik, out of reconquered Bosnian territory. On the death\r\nof Mahommed II. in 1481, a unique opportunity for the intervention of\r\nEurope in Turkish affairs presented itself. A civil war ensued in Turkey\r\nbetween his sons Bayezid and Jem, and the latter, being worsted, fled to\r\nthe knights of Rhodes, by whom he was kept in custody in France (see\r\nBAYEZID II.). Matthias, as the next-door neighbour of the Turks, claimed\r\nthe custody of so valuable a hostage, and would have used him as a means\r\nof extorting concessions from Bayezid. But neither the pope nor the\r\nVenetians would hear of such a transfer, and the negotiations on this\r\nsubject greatly embittered Matthias against the Curia. The last days of\r\nMatthias were occupied in endeavouring to secure the succession to the\r\nthrone for his illegitimate son János (see CORVINUS, JÁNOS); but Queen\r\nBeatrice, though childless, fiercely and openly opposed the idea and the\r\nmatter was still pending when Matthias, who had long been crippled by\r\ngout, expired very suddenly on Palm Sunday, the 4th of April 1490.\r\n\r\nMatthias Hunyadi was indisputably the greatest man of his day, and one\r\nof the greatest monarchs who ever reigned. The precocity and\r\nuniversality of his genius impress one the most. Like Napoleon, with\r\nwhom he has often been compared, he was equally illustrious as a\r\nsoldier, a statesman, an orator, a legislator and an administrator. But\r\nin all moral qualities the brilliant adventurer of the 15th was\r\ninfinitely superior to the brilliant adventurer of the 19th century.\r\nThough naturally passionate, Matthias's self-control was almost\r\nsuperhuman, and throughout his stormy life, with his innumerable\r\nexperiences of ingratitude and treachery, he never was guilty of a\r\nsingle cruel or vindictive action. His capacity for work was\r\ninexhaustible. Frequently half his nights were spent in reading, after\r\nthe labour of his most strenuous days. There was no branch of knowledge\r\nin which he did not take an absorbing interest, no polite art which he\r\ndid not cultivate and encourage. His camp was a school of chivalry, his\r\ncourt a nursery of poets and artists. Matthias was a middle-sized,\r\nbroad-shouldered man of martial bearing, with a large fleshy nose, hair\r\nreaching to his heels, and the clean-shaven, heavy chinned face of an\r\nearly Roman emperor.\r\n\r\n  See Vilmós Fraknói, _King Matthias Hunyadi_ (Hung., Budapest, 1890,\r\n  German ed., Freiburg, 1891); Ignácz Acsády, _History of the Hungarian\r\n  Realm_ (Hung. vol. i., Budapest, 1904); József Teleki, _The Age of the\r\n  Hunyadis in Hungary_ (Hung., vols. 3-5, Budapest, 1852-1890); V.\r\n  Fraknói, _Life of János Vitéz_ (Hung.

(R. N. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHISSON, FRIEDRICH VON (1761-1831), German poet, was born at\r\nHohendodeleben near Magdeburg, the son of the village pastor, on the\r\n23rd of January 1761. After studying theology and philology at the\r\nuniversity of Halle, he was appointed in 1781 master at the classical\r\nschool Philanthropin in Dessau. This once famous seminary was, however,\r\nthen rapidly decaying in public favour, and in 1784 Matthisson was glad\r\nto accept a travelling tutorship. He lived for two years with the Swiss\r\nauthor Bonstetten at Nyon on the lake of Geneva. In 1794 he was\r\nappointed reader and travelling companion to the princess Louisa of\r\nAnhalt-Dessau. In 1812 he entered the service of the king of\r\nWürttemberg, was ennobled, created counsellor of legation, appointed\r\nintendant of the court theatre and chief librarian of the royal library\r\nat Stuttgart. In 1828 he retired and settled at Wörlitz near Dessau,\r\nwhere he died on the 12th of March 1831. Matthisson enjoyed for a time a\r\ngreat popularity on account of his poems, _Gedichte_ (1787; 15th ed.,\r\n1851; new ed., 1876), which Schiller extravagantly praised for their\r\nmelancholy sweetness and their fine descriptions of scenery. The verse\r\nis melodious and the language musical, but the thought and sentiments\r\nthey express are too often artificial and insincere. His _Adelaide_ has\r\nbeen rendered famous owing to Beethoven's setting of the song. Of his\r\nelegies, _Die Elegie in den Ruinen eines alten Bergschlosses_ is still a\r\nfavourite. His reminiscences, _Erinnerungen_ (5 vols., 1810-1816),\r\ncontain interesting accounts of his travels.\r\n\r\n  Matthisson's _Schriften_ appeared in eight volumes (1825-1829), of\r\n  which the first contains his poems, the remainder his _Erinnerungen_;\r\n  a ninth volume was added in 1833 containing his biography by H.\r\n  Döring. His _Literarischer Nachlass_, with a selection from his\r\n  correspondence, was published in four volumes by F. R. Schoch in 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTING, a general term embracing many coarse woven or plaited fibrous\r\nmaterials used for covering floors or furniture, for hanging as screens,\r\nfor wrapping up heavy merchandise and for other miscellaneous purposes.\r\nIn the United Kingdom, under the name of \"coir\" matting, a large amount\r\nof a coarse kind of carpet is made from coco-nut fibre; and the same\r\nmaterial, as well as strips of cane, Manila hemp, various grasses and\r\nrushes, is largely employed in various forms for making door mats. Large\r\nquantities of the coco-nut fibre are woven in heavy looms, then cut up\r\ninto various sizes, and finally bound round the edges by a kind of rope\r\nmade from the same material. The mats may be of one colour only, or they\r\nmay be made of different colours and in different designs. Sometimes the\r\nnames of institutions are introduced into the mats. Another type of mat\r\nis made exclusively from the above-mentioned rope by arranging alternate\r\nlayers in sinuous and straight paths, and then stitching the parts\r\ntogether. It is also largely used for the outer covering of ships'\r\nfenders. Perforated and otherwise prepared rubber, as well as wire-woven\r\nmaterial, are also largely utilized for door and floor mats. Matting of\r\nvarious kinds is very extensively employed throughout India for floor\r\ncoverings, the bottoms of bedsteads, fans and fly-flaps, &c.; and a\r\nconsiderable export trade in such manufactures is carried on. The\r\nmaterials used are numerous; but the principal substances are straw, the\r\nbulrushes _Typha elephantina_ and _T. angustifolia_, leaves of the date\r\npalm (_Phoenix sylvestris_), of the dwarf palm (_Chamaerops Ritchiana_),\r\nof the Palmyra palm (_Borassus flabelliformis_), of the coco-nut palm\r\n(_Cocos nucifera_) and of the screw pine (_Pandanus odoratissimus_), the\r\nmunja or munj grass (_Saccharum Munja_) and allied grasses, and the mat\r\ngrasses _Cyperus textilis_ and _C. Pangorei_, from the last of which the\r\nwell-known Palghat mats of the Madras Presidency are made. Many of these\r\nIndian grass-mats are admirable examples of elegant design, and the\r\ncolours in which they are woven are rich, harmonious and effective in\r\nthe highest degree. Several useful household articles are made from the\r\ndifferent kinds of grasses. The grasses are dyed in all shades and\r\nplaited to form attractive designs suitable for the purposes to which\r\nthey are to be applied. This class of work obtains in India, Japan and\r\nother Eastern countries. Vast quantities of coarse matting used for\r\npacking furniture, heavy and coarse goods, flax and other plants, &c.,\r\nare made in Russia from the bast or inner bark of the lime tree. This\r\nindustry centres in the great forest governments of Viatka,\r\nNizhniy-Novgorod, Kostroma, Kazan, Perm and Simbirsk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTOCK (O.E. _mattuc_, of uncertain origin), a tool having a double\r\niron head, of which one end is shaped like an adze, and the other like a\r\npickaxe. The head has a socket in the centre in which the handle is\r\ninserted transversely to the blades. It is used chiefly for grubbing and\r\nrooting among tree stumps in plantations and copses, where the roots are\r\ntoo close for the use of a spade, or for loosening hard soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTO GROSSO, an inland state of Brazil, bounded N. by Amazonas and\r\nPará, E. by Goyaz, Minas Geraes, São Paulo and Paraná, S. by Paraguay\r\nand S.W. and W. by Bolivia. It ranks next to Amazonas in size, its area,\r\nwhich is largely unsettled and unexplored, being 532,370 sq. m., and its\r\npopulation only 92,827 in 1890 and 118,025 in 1900. No satisfactory\r\nestimate of its Indian population can be made. The greater part of the\r\nstate belongs to the western extension of the Brazilian plateau, across\r\nwhich, between the 14th and 16th parallels, runs the watershed which\r\nseparates the drainage basins of the Amazon and La Plata. This elevated\r\nregion is known as the plateau of Matto Grosso, and its elevations so\r\nfar as known rarely exceed 3000 ft. The northern slope of this great\r\nplateau is drained by the Araguaya-Tocantins, Xingú, Tapajos and\r\nGuaporé-Mamoré-Madeira, which flow northward, and, except the first,\r\nempty into the Amazon; the southern slope drains southward through a\r\nmultitude of streams flowing into the Paraná and Paraguay. The general\r\nelevation in the south part of the state is much lower, and large areas\r\nbordering the Paraguay are swampy, partially submerged plains which the\r\nsluggish rivers are unable to drain. The lowland elevations in this part\r\nof the state range from 300 to 400 ft. above sea-level, the climate is\r\nhot, humid and unhealthy, and the conditions for permanent settlement\r\nare apparently unfavourable. On the highlands, however, which contain\r\nextensive open _campos_, the climate, though dry and hot, is considered\r\nhealthy. The basins of the Paraná and Paraguay are separated by low\r\nmountain ranges extending north from the _sierras_ of Paraguay. In the\r\nnorth, however, the ranges which separate the river valleys are\r\napparently the remains of the table-land through which deep valleys have\r\nbeen eroded. The resources of Matto Grosso are practically undeveloped,\r\nowing to the isolated situation of the state, the costs of\r\ntransportation and the small population.\r\n\r\nThe first industry was that of mining, gold having been discovered in\r\nthe river valleys on the southern slopes of the plateau, and diamonds on\r\nthe head-waters of the Paraguay, about Diamantino and in two or three\r\nother districts. Gold is found chiefly in placers, and in colonial times\r\nthe output was large, but the deposits were long ago exhausted and the\r\nindustry is now comparatively unimportant. As to other minerals little\r\nis definitely known. Agriculture exists only for the supply of local\r\nneeds, though tobacco of a superior quality is grown. Cattle-raising,\r\nhowever, has received some attention and is the principal industry of\r\nthe landowners. The forest products of the state include fine woods,\r\nrubber, ipecacuanha, sarsaparilla, jaborandi, vanilla and copaiba. There\r\nis little export, however, the only means of communication being down\r\nthe Paraguay and Paraná rivers by means of subsidized steamers. The\r\ncapital of the state is Cuyabá, and the chief commercial town is Corumbá\r\nat the head of navigation for the larger river boats, and 1986 m. from\r\nthe mouth of the La Plata. Communication between these two towns is\r\nmaintained by a line of smaller boats, the distance being 517 m.\r\n\r\nThe first permanent settlements in Matto Grosso seem to have been made\r\nin 1718 and 1719, in the first year at Forquilha and in the second at or\r\nnear the site of Cuyabá, where rich placer mines had been found. At this\r\ntime all this inland region was considered a part of São Paulo, but in\r\n1748 it was made a separate _capitania_ and was named Matto Grosso\r\n(\"great woods\"). In 1752 its capital was situated on the right bank of\r\nthe Guaporé river and was named Villa Bella da Santissima Trindade de\r\nMatto Grosso, but in 1820 the seat of government was removed to Cuyabá\r\nand Villa Bella has fallen into decay. In 1822 Matto Grosso became a\r\nprovince of the empire and in 1889 a republican state. It was invaded by\r\nthe Paraguayans in the war of 1860-65.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTOON, a city of Coles county, Illinois, U.S.A., in the east central\r\npart of the state, about 12 m. south-east of Peoria. Pop. (1890), 6833;\r\n(1900), 9622, of whom 430 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 11,456. It is\r\nserved by the Illinois Central and Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St\r\nLouis railways, which have repair shops here, and by inter-urban\r\nelectric lines. The city has a public library, a Methodist Episcopal\r\nHospital, and an Old Folks' Home, the last supported by the Independent\r\nOrder of Odd Fellows. Mattoon is an important shipping point for Indian\r\ncorn and broom corn, extensively grown in the vicinity, and for fruit\r\nand livestock. Among its manufactures are foundry and machine shop\r\nproducts, stoves and bricks; in 1905 the factory product was valued at\r\n$1,308,781, an increase of 71.2% over that in 1900. The municipality\r\nowns the waterworks and an electric lighting plant. Mattoon was first\r\nsettled about 1855, was named in honour of William Mattoon, an early\r\nlandowner, was first chartered as a city in 1857, and was reorganized\r\nunder a general state law in 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTRESS (O.Fr. _materas_, mod. _matelas_; the origin is the Arab.\r\n_al-materah_, cushion, whence Span. and Port. _almadraque_, Ital.\r\n_materasso_), the padded foundation of a bed, formed of canvas or other\r\nstout material stuffed with wool, hair, flock or straw; in the last case\r\nit is properly known as a \"palliasse\" (Fr. _paille_, straw; Lat.\r\n_palea_); but this term is often applied to an under-mattress stuffed\r\nwith substances other than straw. The padded mattress on which lay the\r\nfeather-bed has been replaced by the \"wire-mattress,\" a network of wire\r\nstretched on a light wooden or iron frame, which is either a separate\r\nstructure or a component part of the bedstead itself. The\r\n\"wire-mattress\" has taken the place of the \"spring mattress,\" in which\r\nspiral springs support the stuffing. The term \"mattress\" is used in\r\nengineering for a mat of brushwood, faggots, &c., corded together and\r\nused as a foundation or as surface in the construction of dams, jetties,\r\ndikes, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATURIN, CHARLES ROBERT (1782-1824), Irish novelist and dramatist, was\r\nborn in Dublin in 1782. His grandfather, Gabriel Jasper Maturin, had\r\nbeen Swift's successor in the deanery of St Patrick. Charles Maturin was\r\neducated at Trinity College, Dublin, and became curate of Loughrea and\r\nthen of St Peter's, Dublin. His first novels, _The Fatal Revenge; or,\r\nthe Family of Montorio_ (1807), _The Wild Irish Boy_ (1808), _The\r\nMilesian Chief_ (1812), were issued under the pseudonym of \"Dennis\r\nJasper Murphy.\" All these were mercilessly ridiculed, but the irregular\r\npower displayed in them attracted the notice of Sir Walter Scott, who\r\nrecommended the author to Byron. Through their influence Maturin's\r\ntragedy of _Bertram_ was produced at Drury Lane in 1816, with Kean and\r\nMiss Kelly in the leading parts. A French version by Charles Nodier and\r\nBaron Taylor was produced in Paris at the Théâtre Favart. Two more\r\ntragedies, _Manuel_ (1817) and _Fredolfo_ (1819), were failures, and his\r\npoem _The Universe_ (1821) fell flat. He wrote three more novels,\r\n_Women_ (1818), _Melmoth, the Wanderer_ (1820), and _The Albigenses_\r\n(1824). _Melmoth_, which forms its author's title to remembrance, is the\r\nbest of them, and has for hero a kind of \"Wandering Jew.\" Honoré de\r\nBalzac wrote a sequel to it under the title of _Melmoth réconcilié à\r\nl'église_ (1835). Maturin died in Dublin on the 30th of October 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATVYEEV, ARTAMON SERGYEEVICH ( -1682), Russian statesman and reformer,\r\nwas one of the greatest of the precursors of Peter the Great. His\r\nparentage and the date of his birth are uncertain. Apparently his birth\r\nwas humble, but when the obscure figure of the young Artamon emerges\r\ninto the light of history we find him equipped at all points with the\r\nnewest ideas, absolutely free from the worst prejudices of his age, a\r\nripe scholar, and even an author of some distinction. In 1671 the tsar\r\nAlexius and Artamon were already on intimate terms, and on the\r\nretirement of Orduin-Nashchokin Matvyeev became the tsar's chief\r\ncounsellor. It was at his house, full of all the wondrous,\r\nhalf-forbidden novelties of the west, that Alexius, after the death of\r\nhis first consort, Martha, met Matvyeev's favourite pupil, the beautiful\r\nNatalia Naruishkina, whom he married on the 21st of January 1672. At the\r\nend of the year Matvyeev was raised to the rank of _okolnichy_, and on\r\nthe 1st of September 1674 attained the still higher dignity of _boyar_.\r\nMatvyeev remained paramount to the end of the reign and introduced\r\nplay-acting and all sorts of refining western novelties into Muscovy.\r\nThe deplorable physical condition of Alexius's immediate successor,\r\nTheodore III. suggested to Matvyeev the desirability of elevating to\r\nthe throne the sturdy little tsarevich Peter, then in his fourth year.\r\nHe purchased the allegiance of the _stryeltsi_, or musketeers, and then,\r\nsummoning the boyars of the council, earnestly represented to them that\r\nTheodore, scarce able to live, was surely unable to reign, and urged the\r\nsubstitution of little Peter. But the reactionary boyars, among whom\r\nwere the near kinsmen of Theodore, proclaimed him tsar and Matvyeev was\r\nbanished to Pustozersk, in northern Russia, where he remained till\r\nTheodore's death (April 27, 1682). Immediately afterwards Peter was\r\nproclaimed tsar by the patriarch, and the first _ukaz_ issued in Peter's\r\nname summoned Matvyeev to return to the capital and act as chief adviser\r\nto the tsaritsa Natalia. He reached Moscow on the 15th of May, prepared\r\n\"to lay down his life for the tsar,\" and at once proceeded to the head\r\nof the Red Staircase to meet and argue with the assembled stryeltsi, who\r\nhad been instigated to rebel by the anti-Petrine faction. He had already\r\nsucceeded in partially pacifying them, when one of their colonels began\r\nto abuse the still hesitating and suspicious musketeers. Infuriated,\r\nthey seized and flung Matvyeev into the square below, where he was\r\nhacked to pieces by their comrades.\r\n\r\n  See R. Nisbet Bain, _The First Romanovs_ (London, 1905); M. P.\r\n  Pogodin, _The First Seventeen Years of the Life of Peter the Great_\r\n  (Rus.), (Moscow, 1875); S. M. Solovev, _History of Russia_ (Rus.),\r\n  (vols. 12, 13, (St Petersburg, 1895, &c.); L.

B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUBEUGE, a town of northern France, in the department of Nord, situated\r\non both banks of the Sambre, here canalized, 23½ m. by rail E. by S. of\r\nValenciennes, and about 2 m. from the Belgian frontier. Pop. (1906),\r\ntown 13,569, commune 21,520. As a fortress Maubeuge has an old enceinte\r\nof bastion trace which serves as the centre of an important entrenched\r\ncamp of 18 m. perimeter, constructed for the most part after the war of\r\n1870, but since modernized and augmented. The town has a board of trade\r\narbitration, a communal college, a commercial and industrial school; and\r\nthere are important foundries, forges and blast-furnaces, together with\r\nmanufactures of machine-tools, porcelain, &c. It is united by electric\r\ntramway with Hautmont (pop. 12,473), also an important metallurgical\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nMaubeuge (_Malbodium_) owes its origin to a double monastery, for men\r\nand women, founded in the 7th century by St Aldegonde relics of whom are\r\npreserved in the church. It subsequently belonged to the territory of\r\nHainault. It was burnt by Louis XI., by Francis I., and by Henry II.,\r\nand was finally assigned to France by the Treaty of Nijmwegen. It was\r\nfortified at Vauban by the command of Louis XIV., who under Turenne\r\nfirst saw military service there. Besieged in 1793 by Prince Josias of\r\nCoburg, it was relieved by the victory of Wattignies, which is\r\ncommemorated by a monument in the town. It was unsuccessfully besieged\r\nin 1814, but was compelled to capitulate, after a vigorous resistance,\r\nin the Hundred Days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUCH CHUNK, a borough and the county-seat of Carbon county,\r\nPennsylvania, U.S.A., on the W. bank of the Lehigh river and on the\r\nLehigh Coal and Navigation Company's Canal, 46 m. by rail W.N.W. of\r\nEaston. Pop. (1800), 4101; (1900), 4029 (571 foreign-born); (1910),\r\n3952. Mauch Chunk is served by the Central of New Jersey railway and, at\r\nEast Mauch Chunk, across the river, connected by electric railway, by\r\nthe Lehigh Valley railway. The borough lies in the valley of the Lehigh\r\nriver, along which runs one of its few streets and in another deeply cut\r\nvalley at right angles to the river; through this second valley east and\r\nwest runs the main street, on which is an electric railway; parallel to\r\nit on the south is High Street, formerly an Irish settlement; half way\r\nup the steep hill, and on the north at the top of the opposite hill is\r\nthe ward of Upper Mauch Chunk, reached by the electric railway. An\r\nincline railway, originally used to transport coal from the mines to the\r\nriver and named the \"Switch-Back,\" now carries tourists up the steep\r\nslopes of Mount Pisgah and Mount Jefferson, to Summit Hill, a rich\r\nanthracite coal region, with a famous \"burning mine,\" which has been on\r\nfire since 1832, and then back. An electric railway to the top of\r\nFlagstaff Mountain, built in 1900, was completed in 1901 to Lehighton, 4\r\nm. south-east of Mauch Chunk, where coal is mined and silk and stoves\r\nare manufactured, and which had a population in 1900 of 4629, and in\r\n1910 of 5316. Immediately above Mauch Chunk the river forms a horseshoe;\r\non the opposite side, connected by a bridge, is the borough of East\r\nMauch Chunk (pop. 1900, 3458; 1910, 3548); and 2 m. up the river is Glen\r\nOnoko, with fine falls and cascades. The principal buildings in Mauch\r\nChunk are the county court house, a county gaol, a Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociation building, and the Dimmick Memorial Library (1890). The\r\nborough was long a famous shipping point for coal. It now has ironworks\r\nand foundries, and in East Mauch Chunk there are silk mills. The name is\r\nIndian and means \"Bear Mountain,\" this English name being used for a\r\nmountain on the east side of the river. The borough was founded by the\r\nLehigh Coal and Navigation Company in 1818. This company began in 1827\r\nthe operation of the \"Switch-Back,\" probably the first railway in the\r\ncountry to be used for transporting coal. In 1831 the town was opened to\r\nindividual enterprise, and in 1850 it was incorporated as a borough.\r\nMauch Chunk was for many years the home of Asa Packer, the projector and\r\nbuilder of the Lehigh Valley railroad from Mauch Chunk to Easton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUCHLINE, a town in the division of Kyle, Ayrshire, Scotland. Pop.\r\n(1901), 1767. It lies 8 m. E.S.E. of Kilmarnock and 11 m. E. by N. of\r\nAyr by the Glasgow and South-Western railway. It is situated on a gentle\r\nslope about 1 m. from the river Ayr, which flows through the south of\r\nthe parish of Mauchline. It is noted for its manufacture of snuff-boxes\r\nand knick-knacks in wood, and of curling-stones. There is also some\r\ncabinet-making, besides spinning and weaving, and its horse fairs and\r\ncattle markets have more than local celebrity. The parish church, dating\r\nfrom 1829, stands in the middle of the village, and on the green a\r\nmonument, erected in 1830, marks the spot where five Covenanters were\r\nkilled in 1685. Robert Burns lived with his brother Gilbert on the farm\r\nof Mossgiel, about a mile to the north, from 1784 to 1788. Mauchline\r\nkirkyard was the scene of the \"Holy Fair\"; at \"Poosie Nansie's\" (Agnes\r\nGibson's)--still, though much altered, a popular inn--the \"Jolly\r\nBeggars\" held their high jinks; near the church (in the poet's day an\r\nold, barn-like structure) was the Whiteford Arms inn, where on a pane of\r\nglass Burns wrote the epitaph on John Dove, the landlord; \"auld Nanse\r\nTinnock's\" house, with the date of 1744 above the door, nearly faces the\r\nentrance to the churchyard; the Rev. William Auld was minister of\r\nMauchline, and \"Holy Willie,\" whom the poet scourged in the celebrated\r\n\"Prayer,\" was one of \"Daddy Auld's\" elders; behind the kirkyard stands\r\nthe house of Gavin Hamilton, the lawyer and firm friend of Burns, in\r\nwhich the poet was married. The braes of Ballochmyle, where he met the\r\nheroine of his song, \"The Lass o' Ballochmyle,\" lie about a mile to the\r\nsouth-east. Adjoining them is the considerable manufacturing town of\r\nCATRINE (pop. 2340), with cotton factories, bleach fields and brewery,\r\nwhere Dr Matthew Stewart (1717-1785), the father of Dugald Stewart--had\r\na mansion, and where there is a big water-wheel said to be inferior in\r\nsize only to that of Laxey in the Isle of Man. Barskimming House, 2 m.\r\nsouth by west of Mauchline, the seat of Lord-President Miller\r\n(1717-1789), was burned down in 1882. Near the confluence of the Fail\r\nand the Ayr was the scene of Burns's parting with Highland Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUDE, CYRIL (1862-   ), English actor, was born in London and educated\r\nat Charterhouse. He began his career as an actor in 1883 in America, and\r\nfrom 1896 to 1905 was co-manager with F. Harrison of the Haymarket\r\nTheatre, London. There he became distinguished for his quietly humorous\r\nacting in many parts. In 1906 he went into management on his own\r\naccount, and in 1907 opened his new theatre The Playhouse. In 1888 he\r\nmarried the actress Winifred Emery (b. 1862), who had made her London\r\ndébut as a child in 1875, and acted with Irving at the Lyceum between\r\n1881 and 1887. She was a daughter of Samuel Anderson Emery (1817-1881)\r\nand granddaughter of John Emery (1777-1822), both well-known actors in\r\ntheir day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAULE, a coast province of central Chile, bounded N. by Talea, E. by\r\nLinares and Nuble, and S. by Concepción, and lying between the rivers\r\nMaule and Itata, which form its northern and southern boundaries. Pop.\r\n(1895), 119,791; area, 2475 sq. m. Maule is traversed from north to\r\nsouth by the coast range and its surfaces are much broken. The\r\nBuchupureo river flows westward across the province. The climate is mild\r\nand healthy. Agriculture and stock-raising are the principal\r\noccupations, and hides, cattle, wheat and timber are exported. Transport\r\nfacilities are afforded by the Maule and the Itata, which are navigable,\r\nand by a branch of the government railway from Cauquenes to Parral, an\r\nimportant town of southern Linares. The provincial capital, Cauquenes\r\n(pop., in 1895, 8574; 1902 estimate, 9895), is centrally situated on the\r\nBuchupureo river, on the eastern slopes of the coast cordilleras. The\r\ntown and port of Constitución (pop., in 1900, about 7000) on the south\r\nbank of the Maule, one mile above its mouth, was formerly the capital of\r\nthe province. The port suffers from a dangerous bar at the mouth of the\r\nriver, but is connected with Talca by rail and has a considerable trade.\r\n\r\nThe Maule river, from which the province takes its name, is of historic\r\ninterest because it is said to have marked the southern limits of the\r\nInca Empire. It rises in the Laguna del Maule, an Andean lake near the\r\nArgentine frontier, 7218 ft. above sea-level, and flows westward about\r\n140 m. to the Pacific, into which it discharges in 35° 18´ S. The upper\r\npart of its drainage basin, to which the _Anuario Hydrografico_ gives an\r\narea of 8000 sq. m., contains the volcanoes of San Pedro (11,800 ft.),\r\nthe Descabezado (12,795 ft.), and others of the same group of lower\r\nelevations. The upper course and tributaries of the Maule, principally\r\nin the province of Linares, are largely used for irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAULÉON, SAVARI DE (d. 1236), French soldier, was the son of Raoul de\r\nMauléon, vicomte de Thouars and lord of Mauléon (now Châtillon-sur-Sèvre).\r\nHaving espoused the cause of Arthur of Brittany, he was captured at\r\nMirebeau (1202), and imprisoned in the château of Corfe. But John set him\r\nat liberty in 1204, gained him to his side and named him seneschal of\r\nPoitou (1205). In 1211 Savari de Mauléon assisted Raymond VI. count of\r\nToulouse, and with him besieged Simon de Montfort in Castelnaudary. Philip\r\nAugustus bought his services in 1212 and gave him command of a fleet which\r\nwas destroyed in the Flemish port of Damme. Then Mauléon returned to John,\r\nwhom he aided in his struggle with the barons in 1215. He was one of those\r\nwhom John designated on his deathbed for a council of regency (1216). Then\r\nhe went to Egypt (1219), and was present at the taking of Damietta.\r\nReturning to Poitou he was a second time seneschal for the king of\r\nEngland. He defended Saintonge against Louis VIII. in 1224, but was\r\naccused of having given La Rochelle up to the king of France, and the\r\nsuspicions of the English again threw him back upon the French. Louis\r\nVIII. then turned over to him the defence of La Rochelle and the coast of\r\nSaintonge. In 1227 he took part in the rising of the barons of Poitiers\r\nand Anjou against the young Louis IX. He enjoyed a certain reputation for\r\nhis poems in the _langue d'oc_.\r\n\r\n  See Chilhaud-Dumaine, \"Savari de Mauléon,\" in _Positions des Thèses\r\n  des élèves de l'École des Chartes_ (1877); _Histoire littéraire de la\r\n  France_, xviii. 671-682.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAULSTICK, or MAHLSTICK, a stick with a soft leather or padded head,\r\nused by painters to support the hand that holds the brush. The word is\r\nan adaptation of the Dutch _maalstok_, i.e. the painter's stick, from\r\n_malen_, to paint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUNDY THURSDAY (through O.Fr. _mandé_ from Lat. _mandatum_,\r\ncommandment, in allusion to Christ's words: \"A new commandment give I\r\nunto you,\" after he had washed the disciples' feet at the Last Supper),\r\nthe Thursday before Easter. Maundy Thursday is sometimes known as\r\n_Sheer_ or _Chare_ Thursday, either in allusion, it is thought, to the\r\n\"shearing\" of heads and beards in preparation for Easter, or more\r\nprobably in the word's Middle English sense of \"pure,\" in allusion to\r\nthe ablutions of the day. The chief ceremony, as kept from the early\r\nmiddle ages onwards--the washing of the feet of twelve or more poor men\r\nor beggars--was in the early Church almost unknown. Of Chrysostom and St\r\nAugustine, who both speak of Maundy Thursday as being marked by a\r\nsolemn celebration of the Sacrament, the former does not mention the\r\nfoot-washing, and the latter merely alludes to it. Perhaps an indication\r\nof it may be discerned as early as the 4th century in a custom, current\r\nin Spain, northern Italy and elsewhere, of washing the feet of the\r\ncatechumens towards the end of Lent before their baptism. It was not,\r\nhowever, universal, and in the 48th canon of the synod of Elvira (A.D.\r\n306) it is expressly prohibited (cf. _Corp. Jur. Can._, c. 104, _caus._\r\ni. _qu._ 1). From the 4th century ceremonial foot-washing became yearly\r\nmore common, till it was regarded as a necessary rite, to be performed\r\nby the pope, all Catholic sovereigns, prelates, priests and nobles. In\r\nEngland the king washed the feet of as many poor men as he was years\r\nold, and then distributed to them meat, money and clothes. At Durham\r\nCathedral, until the 16th century, every charity-boy had a monk to wash\r\nhis feet. At Peterborough Abbey, in 1530, Wolsey made \"his maund in Our\r\nLady's Chapel, having fifty-nine poor men whose feet he washed and\r\nkissed; and after he had wiped them he gave every of the said poor men\r\ntwelve pence in money, three ells of good canvas to make them shirts, a\r\npair of new shoes, a cast of red herrings and three white herrings.\"\r\nQueen Elizabeth performed the ceremony, the paupers' feet, however,\r\nbeing first washed by the yeomen of the laundry with warm water and\r\nsweet herbs. James II. was the last English monarch to perform the rite.\r\nWilliam III. delegated the washing to his almoner, and this was usual\r\nuntil the middle of the 18th century. Since 1754 the foot-washing has\r\nbeen abandoned, and the ceremony now consists of the presentation of\r\nMaundy money, officially called Maundy Pennies. These were first coined\r\nin the reign of Charles II. They come straight from the Mint, and have\r\ntheir edges unmilled. The service which formerly took place in the\r\nChapel Royal, Whitehall, is now held in Westminster Abbey. A procession\r\nis formed in the nave, consisting of the lord high almoner representing\r\nthe sovereign, the clergy and the yeomen of the guard, the latter\r\ncarrying white and red purses in baskets. The clothes formerly given are\r\nnow commuted for in cash. The full ritual is gone through by the Roman\r\nCatholic archbishop of Westminster, and abroad it survives in all\r\nCatholic countries, a notable example being that of the Austrian\r\nemperor. In the Greek Church the rite survives notably at Moscow, St\r\nPetersburg and Constantinople. It is on Maundy Thursday that in the\r\nChurch of Rome the sacred oil is blessed, and the chrism prepared\r\naccording to an elaborate ritual which is given in the _Pontificale_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUPASSANT, HENRI RENÉ ALBERT GUY DE (1850-1893), French novelist and\r\npoet, was born at the Château of Miromesnil in the department of\r\nSeine-Inférieure on the 5th August 1850. His grandfather, a landed\r\nproprietor of a good Lorraine family, owned an estate at\r\nNeuville-Champ-d'Oisel near Rouen, and bequeathed a moderate fortune to\r\nhis son, a Paris stockbroker, who married Mademoiselle Laure Lepoitevin.\r\nMaupassant was educated at Yvetot and at the Rouen lycée. A copy of\r\nverses entitled _Le Dieu créateur_, written during his year of\r\nphilosophy, has been preserved and printed. He entered the ministry of\r\nmarine, and was promoted by M. Bardoux to the Cabinet de l'Instruction\r\npublique. A pleasant legend says that, in a report by his official\r\nchief, Maupassant is mentioned as not reaching the standard of the\r\ndepartment in the matter of style. He may very well have been an\r\nunsatisfactory clerk, as he divided his time between rowing expeditions\r\nand attending the literary gatherings at the house of Gustave Flaubert,\r\nwho was not, as he is often alleged to be, connected with Maupassant by\r\nany blood tie. Flaubert was not his uncle, nor his cousin, nor even his\r\ngodfather, but merely an old friend of Madame de Maupassant, whom he had\r\nknown from childhood. At the literary meetings Maupassant seldom shared\r\nin the conversation. Upon those who met him--Tourgenieff, Alphonse\r\nDaudet, Catulle Mendès, José-Maria de Heredia and Émile Zola--he left\r\nthe impression of a simple young athlete. Even Flaubert, to whom\r\nMaupassant submitted some sketches, was not greatly struck by their\r\ntalent, though he encouraged the youth to persevere. Maupassant's first\r\nessay was a dramatic piece twice given at Étretat in 1873 before an\r\naudience which included Tourgenieff, Flaubert and Meilhac. In this\r\nindecorous performance, of which nothing more is heard, Maupassant\r\nplayed the part of a woman. During the next seven years he served a\r\nsevere apprenticeship to Flaubert, who by this time realized his pupil's\r\nexceptional gifts. In 1880 Maupassant published a volume of poems, _Des\r\nVers_, against which the public prosecutor of Etampes took proceedings\r\nthat were finally withdrawn through the influence of the senator\r\nCordier. From Flaubert, who had himself been prosecuted for his first\r\nbook, _Madame Bovary_, there came a letter congratulating the poet on\r\nthe similarity between their first literary experiences. _Des Vers_ is\r\nan extremely interesting experiment, which shows Maupassant to us still\r\nhesitating in his choice of a medium; but he recognized that it was not\r\nwholly satisfactory, and that its chief deficiency--the absence of\r\nverbal melody--was fatal. Later in the same year he contributed to the\r\n_Soirées de Médan_, a collection of short stories by MM. Zola, J.-K.\r\nHuysmans, Henry Céard, Léon Hennique and Paul Alexis; and in _Boule de\r\nsuif_ the young unknown author revealed himself to his amazed\r\ncollaborators and to the public as an admirable writer of prose and a\r\nconsummate master of the _conte_. There is perhaps no other instance in\r\nmodern literary history of a writer beginning, as a fully equipped\r\nartist, with a genuine masterpiece. This early success was quickly\r\nfollowed by another. The volume entitled _La Maison Tellier_ (1881)\r\nconfirmed the first impression, and vanquished even those who were\r\nrepelled by the author's choice of subjects. In _Mademoiselle Fifi_\r\n(1883) he repeated his previous triumphs as a _conteur_, and in this\r\nsame year he, for the first time, attempted to write on a larger scale.\r\nChoosing to portray the life of a blameless girl, unfortunate in her\r\nmarriage, unfortunate in her son, consistently unfortunate in every\r\ncircumstance of existence, he leaves her, ruined and prematurely old,\r\nclinging to the tragic hope, which time, as one feels, will belie, that\r\nshe may find happiness in her grandson. This picture of an average woman\r\nundergoing the constant agony of disillusion Maupassant calls _Une Vie_\r\n(1883), and as in modern literature there is no finer example of cruel\r\nobservation, so there is no sadder book than this, while the effect of\r\nextreme truthfulness which it conveys justifies its sub-title--_L'Humble\r\nvérité_. Certain passages of _Une Vie_ are of such a character that the\r\nsale of the volume at railway bookstalls was forbidden throughout\r\nFrance. The matter was brought before the chamber of deputies, with the\r\nresult of drawing still more attention to the book, and of advertising\r\nthe _Contes de la bécasse_ (1883), a collection of stories as improper\r\nas they are clever. _Au soleil_ (1884), a book of travels which has the\r\neminent qualities of lucid observation and exact description, was less\r\nread than _Clair de lune_, _Miss Harriet_, _Les Soeurs Rondoli_ and\r\n_Yvette_, all published in 1883-1884 when Maupassant's powers were at\r\ntheir highest level. Three further collections of short tales, entitled\r\n_Contes et nouvelles_, _Monsieur Parent_, and _Contes du jour et de la\r\nnuit_, issued in 1885, proved that while the author's vision was as\r\nincomparable as ever, his fecundity had not improved his impeccable\r\nform. To 1885 also belongs an elaborate novel, _Bel-ami_, the cynical\r\nhistory of a particularly detestable, brutal scoundrel who makes his way\r\nin the world by means of his handsome face. Maupassant is here no less\r\nvivid in realizing his literary men, financiers and frivolous women than\r\nin dealing with his favourite peasants, boors and servants, to whom he\r\nreturned in _Toine_ (1886) and in _La Petite roque_ (1886). About this\r\ntime appeared the first symptoms of the malady which destroyed him; he\r\nwrote less, and though the novel _Mont-Oriol_ (1887) shows him\r\napparently in undiminished possession of his faculty, _Le Horla_ (1887)\r\nsuggests that he was already subject to alarming hallucinations.\r\nRestored to some extent by a sea-voyage, recorded in _Sur l'eau_ (1888),\r\nhe went back to short stories in _Le Rosier de Madame Husson_ (1888), a\r\nburst of Rabelaisian humour equal to anything he had ever written. His\r\nnovels _Pierre et Jean_ (1888), _Fort comme la mort_ (1889), and _Notre\r\ncoeur_ (1890) are penetrating studies touched with a profounder sympathy\r\nthan had hitherto distinguished him; and this softening into pity for\r\nthe tragedy of life is deepened in some of the tales included in\r\n_Inutile beauté_ (1890). One of these, _Le Champ d'Oliviers_, is an\r\nunsurpassable example of poignant, emotional narrative. With _La Vie\r\nerrante_ (1890), a volume of travels, Maupassant's career practically\r\nclosed. _Musotte_, a theatrical piece written in collaboration with M.\r\nJacques Normand, was published in 1891. By this time inherited nervous\r\nmaladies, aggravated by excessive physical exercises and by the\r\nimprudent use of drugs, had undermined his constitution. He began to\r\ntake an interest in religious problems, and for a while made the\r\n_Imitation_ his handbook; but his misanthropy deepened, and he suffered\r\nfrom curious delusions as to his wealth and rank. A victim of general\r\nparalysis, of which _La Folie des grandeurs_ was one of the symptoms, he\r\ndrank the waters at Aix-les-Bains during the summer of 1891, and retired\r\nto Cannes, where he purposed passing the winter. The singularities of\r\nconduct which had been observed at Aix-les-Bains grew more and more\r\nmarked. Maupassant's reason slowly gave way. On the 6th of January 1892\r\nhe attempted suicide, and was removed to Paris, where he died in the\r\nmost painful circumstances on the 6th of July 1893. He is buried in the\r\ncemetery of Montparnasse. The opening chapters of two projected novels,\r\n_L'Angélus_ and _L'Ame étrangère_, were found among his papers; these,\r\nwith _La Paix du ménage_, a comedy in two acts, and two collections of\r\ntales, _Le Père Milon_ (1898) and _Le Colporteur_ (1899), have been\r\npublished posthumously. A correspondence, called _Amitié amoureuse_\r\n(1897), and dedicated to his mother, is probably unauthentic. Among the\r\nprefaces which he wrote for the works of others, only one--an\r\nintroduction to a French prose version of Mr Swinburne's _Poems and\r\nBallads_--is likely to interest English readers.\r\n\r\nMaupassant began as a follower of Flaubert and of M. Zola, but, whatever\r\nthe masters may have called themselves, they both remained essentially\r\n_romantiques_. The pupil is the last of the \"naturalists\": he even\r\ndestroyed naturalism, since he did all that can be done in that\r\ndirection. He had no psychology, no theories of art, no moral or strong\r\nsocial prejudices, no disturbing imagination, no wealth of perplexing\r\nideas. It is no paradox to say that his marked limitations made him the\r\nincomparable artist that he was. Undisturbed by any external influence,\r\nhis marvellous vision enabled him to become a supreme observer, and,\r\ngiven his literary sense, the rest was simple. He prided himself in\r\nhaving no invention; he described nothing that he had not seen. The\r\npeasants whom he had known as a boy figure in a score of tales; what he\r\nsaw in Government offices is set down in _L'Héritage_; from Algiers he\r\ngathers the material for Maroca; he drinks the waters and builds up\r\n_Mont-Oriol_; he enters journalism, constructs _Bel-ami_, and, for the\r\nsake of precision, makes his brother, Hervé de Maupassant, sit for the\r\ninfamous hero's portrait; he sees fashionable society, and, though it\r\nwearied him intensely, he transcribes its life in _Fort comme la mort_\r\nand _Notre coeur_. Fundamentally he finds all men alike. In every grade\r\nhe finds the same ferocious, cunning, animal instincts at work: it is\r\nnot a gay world, but he knows no other; he is possessed by the dread of\r\ngrowing old, of ceasing to enjoy; the horror of death haunts him like a\r\nspectre. It is an extremely simple outlook. Maupassant does not prefer\r\ngood to bad, one man to another; he never pauses to argue about the\r\nmeaning of life, a senseless thing which has the one advantage of\r\nyielding materials for art; his one aim is to discover the hidden aspect\r\nof visible things, to relate what he has observed, to give an objective\r\nrendering of it, and he has seen so intensely and so serenely that he is\r\nthe most exact transcriber in literature. And as the substance is, so is\r\nthe form: his style is exceedingly simple and exceedingly strong; he\r\nuses no rare or superfluous word, and is content to use the humblest\r\nword if only it conveys the exact picture of the thing seen. In ten\r\nyears he produced some thirty volumes. With the exception of _Pierre et\r\nJean_, his novels, excellent as they are, scarcely represent him at his\r\nbest, and of over two hundred _contes_ a proportion must be rejected.\r\nBut enough will remain to vindicate his claim to a permanent place in\r\nliterature as an unmatched observer and the most perfect master of the\r\nshort story.\r\n\r\n  See also F. Brunetière, _Le Roman naturaliste_ (1883); T. Lemaître,\r\n  _Les Contemporains_ (vols. i. v. vi.); R.

Symons, _Studies in Prose and Verse_ (1904).\r\n  There are many references to Maupassant in the _Journal des Goncourt_,\r\n  and some correspondence with Marie Bashkirtseff was printed with\r\n  _Further Memoirs_ of that lady in 1901.     (J. F. K.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUPEOU, RENÉ NICOLAS CHARLES AUGUSTIN (1714-1792), chancellor of\r\nFrance, was born on the 25th of February 1714, being the eldest son of\r\nRené Charles de Maupeou (1688-1775), who was president of the parlement\r\nof Paris from 1743 to 1757. He married in 1744 a rich heiress, Anne de\r\nRoncherolles, a cousin of Madame d'Épinay. Entering public life, he was\r\nhis father's right hand in the conflicts between the parlement and\r\nChristophe de Beaumont, archbishop of Paris, who was supported by the\r\ncourt. Between 1763 and 1768, dates which cover the revision of the case\r\nof Jean Calas and the trial of the comte de Lally, Maupeou was himself\r\npresident of the parlement. In 1768, through the protection of Choiseul,\r\nwhose fall two years later was in large measure his work, he became\r\nchancellor in succession to his father, who had held the office for a\r\nfew days only. He determined to support the royal authority against the\r\nparlement, which in league with the provincial magistratures was seeking\r\nto arrogate to itself the functions of the states-general. He allied\r\nhimself with the duc d'Aiguillon and Madame du Barry, and secured for a\r\ncreature of his own, the Abbé Terrai, the office of comptroller-general.\r\nThe struggle came over the trial of the case of the duc d'Aiguillon,\r\nex-governor of Brittany, and of La Chalotais, procureur-général of the\r\nprovince, who had been imprisoned by the governor for accusations\r\nagainst his administration. When the parlement showed signs of hostility\r\nagainst Aiguillon, Maupeou read letters patent from Louis XV. annulling\r\nthe proceedings. Louis replied to remonstrances from the parlement by a\r\n_lit de justice_, in which he demanded the surrender of the minutes of\r\nprocedure. On the 27th of November 1770 appeared the _Édit de règlement\r\net de discipline_, which was promulgated by the chancellor, forbidding\r\nthe union of the various branches of the parlement and correspondence\r\nwith the provincial magistratures. It also made a strike on the part of\r\nthe parlement punishable by confiscation of goods, and forbade further\r\nobstruction to the registration of royal decrees after the royal reply\r\nhad been given to a first remonstrance. This edict the magistrates\r\nrefused to register, and it was registered in a _lit de justice_ held at\r\nVersailles on the 7th of December, whereupon the parlement suspended its\r\nfunctions. After five summonses to return to their duties, the\r\nmagistrates were surprised individually on the night of the 19th of\r\nJanuary 1771 by musketeers, who required them to sign yes or no to a\r\nfurther request to return. Thirty-eight magistrates gave an affirmative\r\nanswer, but on the exile of their former colleagues by _lettres de\r\ncachet_ they retracted, and were also exiled. Maupeou installed the\r\ncouncil of state to administer justice pending the establishment of six\r\nsuperior courts in the provinces, and of a new parlement in Paris. The\r\n_cour des aides_ was next suppressed.\r\n\r\nVoltaire praised this revolution, applauding the suppression of the old\r\nhereditary magistrature, but in general Maupeou's policy was regarded as\r\nthe triumph of tyranny. The remonstrances of the princes, of the nobles,\r\nand of the minor courts, were met by exile and suppression, but by the\r\nend of 1771 the new system was established, and the Bar, which had\r\noffered a passive resistance, recommenced to plead. But the death of\r\nLouis XV. in May 1774 ruined the chancellor. The restoration of the\r\nparlements was followed by a renewal of the quarrels between the new\r\nking and the magistrature. Maupeou and Terrai were replaced by\r\nMalesherbes and Turgot. Maupeou lived in retreat until his death at\r\nThuit on the 29th of July 1792, having lived to see the overthrow of the\r\n_ancien régime_. His work, in so far as it was directed towards the\r\nseparation of the judicial and political functions and to the reform of\r\nthe abuses attaching to a hereditary magistrature, was subsequently\r\nendorsed by the Revolution; but no justification of his violent methods\r\nor defence of his intriguing and avaricious character is possible. He\r\naimed at securing absolute power for Louis XV., but his action was in\r\nreality a serious blow to the monarchy.\r\n\r\n  The chief authority for the administration of Maupeou is the _compte\r\n  rendu_ in his own justification presented by him to Louis XVI. in\r\n  1789, which included a dossier of his speeches and edicts, and is\r\n  preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale. These documents, in the hands\r\n  of his former secretary, C. F. Lebrun, duc de Plaisance, formed the\r\n  basis of the judicial system of France as established under the\r\n  consulate (cf. C. F. Lebrun, _Opinions, rapports et choix d'écrits\r\n  politiques_, published posthumously in 1829). See further _Maupeouana_\r\n  (6 vols., Paris, 1775), which contains the pamphlets directed against\r\n  him; _Journal hist. de la révolution opérée ... par M. de Maupeou_ (7\r\n  vols., 1775); the official correspondence of Mercy-Argenteau, the\r\n  letters of Mme d'Épinay; and Jules Flammermont, _Le Chancelier Maupeou\r\n  et les parlements_ (1883).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUPERTUIS, PIERRE LOUIS MOREAU DE (1698-1759), French mathematician and\r\nastronomer, was born at St Malo on the 17th of July 1698. When twenty\r\nyears of age he entered the army, becoming lieutenant in a regiment of\r\ncavalry, and employing his leisure on mathematical studies. After five\r\nyears he quitted the army and was admitted in 1723 a member of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences. In 1728 he visited London, and was elected a fellow\r\nof the Royal Society. In 1736 he acted as chief of the expedition sent\r\nby Louis XV. into Lapland to measure the length of a degree of the\r\nmeridian (see EARTH, FIGURE OF), and on his return home he became a\r\nmember of almost all the scientific societies of Europe. In 1740\r\nMaupertuis went to Berlin on the invitation of the king of Prussia, and\r\ntook part in the battle of Mollwitz, where he was taken prisoner by the\r\nAustrians. On his release he returned to Berlin, and thence to Paris,\r\nwhere he was elected director of the Academy of Sciences in 1742, and in\r\nthe following year was admitted into the Academy. Returning to Berlin in\r\n1744, at the desire of Frederick II., he was chosen president of the\r\nRoyal Academy of Sciences in 1746. Finding his health declining, he\r\nrepaired in 1757 to the south of France, but went in 1758 to Basel,\r\nwhere he died on the 27th of July 1759. Maupertuis was unquestionably a\r\nman of considerable ability as a mathematician, but his restless, gloomy\r\ndisposition involved him in constant quarrels, of which his\r\ncontroversies with König and Voltaire during the latter part of his life\r\nfurnish examples.\r\n\r\n  The following are his most important works: _Sur la figure de la\r\n  terre_ (Paris, 1738); _Discours sur la parallaxe de la lune_ (Paris,\r\n  1741); _Discours sur la figure des astres_ (Paris, 1742); _Éléments de\r\n  la géographie_ (Paris, 1742); _Lettre sur la comète de 1742_ (Paris,\r\n  1742); _Astronomie nautique_ (Paris, 1745 and 1746); _Vénus physique_\r\n  (Paris, 1745); _Essai de cosmologie_ (Amsterdam, 1750). His _Oeuvres_\r\n  were published in 1752 at Dresden and in 1756 at Lyons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAU RANIPUR, a town of British India in Jahnsi district, in the United\r\nProvinces. Pop. (1901), 17,231. It contains a large community of wealthy\r\nmerchants and bankers. A special variety of red cotton cloth, known as\r\n_kharua_, is manufactured and exported to all parts of India. Trees line\r\nmany of the streets, and handsome temples ornament the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUREL, ABDIAS (d. 1705), Camisard leader, became a cavalry officer in\r\nthe French army and gained distinction in Italy; here he served under\r\nMarshal Catinat, and on this account he himself is sometimes known as\r\nCatinat. In 1702, when the revolt in the Cévennes broke out, he became\r\none of the Camisard leaders, and in this capacity his name was soon\r\nknown and feared. He refused to accept the peace made by Jean Cavalier\r\nin 1704, and after passing a few weeks in Switzerland he returned to\r\nFrance and became one of the chiefs of those Camisards who were still in\r\narms. He was deeply concerned in a plot to capture some French towns, a\r\nscheme which, it was hoped, would be helped by England and Holland. But\r\nit failed; Maurel was betrayed, and with three other leaders of the\r\nmovement was burned to death at Nîmes on the 22nd of April 1705. He was\r\na man of great physical strength; but he was very cruel, and boasted he\r\nhad killed 200 Roman Catholics with his own hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUREL, VICTOR (1848-   ), French singer, was born at Marseilles, and\r\neducated in music at the Paris Conservatoire. He made his début in opera\r\nat Paris in 1868, and in London in 1873, and from that time onwards his\r\nadmirable acting and vocal method established his reputation as one of\r\nthe finest of operatic baritones. He created the leading part in Verdi's\r\n_Otello_, and was equally fine in Wagnerian and Italian opera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURENBRECHER, KARL PETER WILHELM (1838-1892), German historian, was\r\nborn at Bonn on the 21st of December, 1838, and studied in Berlin and\r\nMunich under Ranke and Von Sybel, being especially influenced by the\r\nlatter historian. After doing some research work at Simancas in Spain,\r\nhe became professor of history at the university of Dorpat in 1867; and\r\nwas then in turn professor at Königsberg, Bonn and Leipzig. He died at\r\nLeipzig on the 6th of November, 1892.\r\n\r\n  Many of Maurenbrecher's works are concerned with the Reformation,\r\n  among them being _England im Reformationszeitalter_ (Düsseldorf,\r\n  1866); _Karl V. und die deutschen Protestanten_ (Düsseldorf, 1865);\r\n  _Studien und Skizzen zur Geschichte der Reformationszeit_ (Leipzig,\r\n  1874); and the incomplete _Geschichte der Katholischen Reformation_\r\n  (Nördlingen, 1880). He also wrote _Don Karlos_ (Berlin, 1876);\r\n  _Gründung des deutschen Reiches 1859-1871_ (Leipzig, 1892, and again\r\n  1902); and _Geschichte der deutschen Königswahlen_ (Leipzig, 1889).\r\n  See G. Wolf, _Wilhelm Maurenbrecher_ (Berlin, 1893).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUREPAS, JEAN FRÉDÉRIC PHÉLYPEAUX, COMTE DE (1701-1781), French\r\nstatesman, was born on the 9th of July 1701 at Versailles, being the son\r\nof Jérôme de Pontchartrain, secretary of state for the marine and the\r\nroyal household. Maurepas succeeded to his father's charge at fourteen,\r\nand began his functions in the royal household at seventeen, while in\r\n1725 he undertook the actual administration of the navy. Although\r\nessentially light and frivolous in character, Maurepas was seriously\r\ninterested in scientific matters, and he used the best brains of France\r\nto apply science to questions of navigation and of naval construction.\r\nHe was disgraced in 1749, and exiled from Paris for an epigram against\r\nMadame de Pompadour. On the accession of Louis XVI., twenty-five years\r\nlater, he became a minister of state and Louis XVI.'s chief adviser. He\r\ngave Turgot the direction of finance, placed Lamoignon-Malesherbes over\r\nthe royal household and made Vergennes minister for foreign affairs. At\r\nthe outset of his new career he showed his weakness by recalling to\r\ntheir functions, in deference to popular clamour, the members of the old\r\nparlement ousted by Maupeou, thus reconstituting the most dangerous\r\nenemy of the royal power. This step, and his intervention on behalf of\r\nthe American states, helped to pave the way for the French revolution.\r\nJealous of his personal ascendancy over Louis XVI., he intrigued against\r\nTurgot, whose disgrace in 1776 was followed after six months of disorder\r\nby the appointment of Necker. In 1781 Maurepas deserted Necker as he had\r\ndone Turgot, and he died at Versailles on the 21st of November 1781.\r\n\r\n  Maurepas is credited with contributions to the collection of facetiae\r\n  known as the _Étrennes de la Saint Jean_ (2nd ed., 1742). Four volumes\r\n  of _Mémoires de Maurepas_, purporting to be collected by his secretary\r\n  and edited by J. L. G. Soulavie in 1792, must be regarded as\r\n  apocryphal. Some of his letters were published in 1896 by the _Soc. de\r\n  l'hist. de Paris_. His _éloge_ in the Academy of Sciences was\r\n  pronounced by Condorcet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURER, GEORG LUDWIG VON (1790-1872), German statesman and historian,\r\nson of a Protestant pastor, was born at Erpolzheim, near Dürkheim, in\r\nthe Rhenish Palatinate, on the 2nd of November 1790. Educated at\r\nHeidelberg, he went in 1812 to reside in Paris, where he entered upon a\r\nsystematic study of the ancient legal institutions of the Germans.\r\nReturning to Germany in 1814, he received an appointment under the\r\nBavarian government, and afterwards filled several important official\r\npositions. In 1824 he published at Heidelberg his _Geschichte des\r\naltgermanischen und namentlich altbayrischen öffentlich-mündlichen\r\nGerichtsverfahrens_, which obtained the first prize of the academy of\r\nMunich, and in 1826 he became professor in the university of Munich. In\r\n1829 he returned to official life, and was soon offered an important\r\npost. In 1832, when Otto (Otho), son of Louis I., king of Bavaria, was\r\nchosen to fill the throne of Greece, a council of regency was nominated\r\nduring his minority, and Maurer was appointed a member. He applied\r\nhimself energetically to the task of creating institutions adapted to\r\nthe requirements of a modern civilized community; but grave difficulties\r\nsoon arose and Maurer was recalled in 1834, when he returned to Munich.\r\nThis loss was a serious one for Greece. Maurer was the ablest, most\r\nenergetic and most liberal-minded member of the council, and it was\r\nthrough his enlightened efforts that Greece obtained a revised penal\r\ncode, regular tribunals and an improved system of civil procedure. Soon\r\nafter his recall he published _Das griechische Volk in öffentlicher,\r\nkirchlicher, und privatrechtlicher Beziehung vor und nach dem\r\nFreiheitskampfe bis zum 31 Juli 1834_ (Heidelberg, 1835-1836), a useful\r\nsource of information for the history of Greece before Otto ascended the\r\nthrone, and also for the labours of the council of regency to the time\r\nof the author's recall. After the fall of the ministry of Karl von Abel\r\n(1788-1859) in 1847, he became chief Bavarian minister and head of the\r\ndepartments of foreign affairs and of justice, but was overthrown in the\r\nsame year. He died at Munich on the 9th of May 1872. His only son,\r\nConrad von Maurer (1823-1902), was a Scandinavian scholar of some\r\nrepute, and like his father was a professor at the university of Munich.\r\n\r\n  Maurer's most important contribution to history is a series of books\r\n  on the early institutions of the Germans. These are: _Einleitung zur\r\n  Geschichte der Mark-, Hof-, Dorf-, und Stadtverfassung und der\r\n  öffentlichen Gewalt_ (Munich, 1854); _Geschichte der Markenverfassung\r\n  in Deutschland_ (Erlangen, 1856); _Geschichte der Fronhöfe, der\r\n  Bauernhöfe, und der Hofverfassung in Deutschland_ (Erlangen,\r\n  1862-1863); _Geschichte der Dorfverfassung in Deutschland_ (Erlangen,\r\n  1865-1866); and _Geschichte der Slädteverfassung in Deutschland_\r\n  (Erlangen, 1869-1871). These works are still important authorities for\r\n  the early history of the Germans. Among other works are, _Das Stadt-\r\n  und Landrechtsbuch Ruprechts von Freising, ein Beitrag zur Geschichte\r\n  des Schwabenspiegels_ (Stuttgart, 1839); _Über die Freipflege (plegium\r\n  liberale), und die Entstehung der grossen und kleinen Jury in England_\r\n  (Munich, 1848); and _Über die deutsche Reichsterritorial- und\r\n  Rechtsgeschichte_ (1830).\r\n\r\n  Sec K. T. von Heigel, _Denkwürdigkeiten des bayrischen Staatsrats G.\r\n  L. von Maurer_ (Munich, 1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURETANIA, the ancient name of the north-western angle of the African\r\ncontinent, and under the Roman Empire also of a large territory eastward\r\nof that angle. The name had different significations at different times;\r\nbut before the Roman occupation, Mauretania comprised a considerable\r\npart of the modern Morocco i.e. the northern portion bounded on the east\r\nby Algiers. Towards the south we may suppose it bounded by the Atlas\r\nrange, and it seems to have been regarded by geographers as extending\r\nalong the coast to the Atlantic as far as the point where that chain\r\ndescends to the sea, in about 30 N. lat. (Strabo, p. 825). The\r\nmagnificent plateau in which the city of Morocco is situated seems to\r\nhave been unknown to ancient geographers, and was certainly never\r\nincluded in the Roman Empire. On the other hand, the Gaetulians to the\r\nsouth of the Atlas range, on the date-producing slopes towards the\r\nSahara, seem to have owned a precarious subjection to the kings of\r\nMauretania, as afterwards to the Roman government. A large part of the\r\ncountry is of great natural fertility, and in ancient times produced\r\nlarge quantities of corn, while the slopes of Atlas were clothed with\r\nforests, which, besides other kinds of timber, produced the celebrated\r\nornamental wood called _citrum_ (Plin. _Hist. Nat._ 13-96), for tables\r\nof which the Romans gave fabulous prices. (For physical geography, see\r\nMOROCCO.)\r\n\r\n  Mauretania, or Maurusia as it was called by Greek writers, signified\r\n  the land of the Mauri, a term still retained in the modern name of\r\n  Moors (q.v.). The origin and ethnical affinities of the race are\r\n  uncertain; but it is probable that all the inhabitants of this\r\n  northern tract of Africa were kindred races belonging to the great\r\n  Berber family, possibly with an intermingled fair-skinned race from\r\n  Europe (see Tissot, _Géographie comparée de la province romaine\r\n  d'Afrique_, i. 400 seq.; also BERBERS). They first appear in history\r\n  at the time of the Jugurthine War (110-106 B.C.), when Mauretania was\r\n  under the government of Bocchus and seems to have been recognized as\r\n  organized state (Sallust, _Jugurtha_, 19). To this Bocchus was given,\r\n  after the war, the western part of Jugurtha's kingdom of Numidia,\r\n  perhaps as far east as Saldae (Bougie). Sixty years later, at the time\r\n  of the dictator Caesar, we find two Mauretanian kingdoms, one to the\r\n  west of the river Mulucha under Bogud, and the other to the east under\r\n  a Bocchus; as to the date or cause of the division we are ignorant.\r\n  Both these kings took Caesar's part in the civil wars, and had their\r\n  territory enlarged by him (Appian, B.C. 4, 54). In 25 B.C., after\r\n  their deaths, Augustus gave the two kingdoms to Juba II. of Numidia\r\n  (see under JUBA), with the river Ampsaga as the eastern frontier\r\n  (Plin. 5. 22; Ptol. 4. 3. 1). Juba and his son Ptolemaeus after him\r\n  reigned till A.D. 40, when the latter was put to death by Caligula,\r\n  and shortly afterwards Claudius incorporated the kingdom into the\r\n  Roman state as two provinces, viz. Mauretania Tingitana to the west\r\n  of the Mulucha and M. Caesariensis to the east of that river, the\r\n  latter taking its name from the city Caesarea (formerly Iol), which\r\n  Juba had thus named and adopted as his capital. Thus the dividing line\r\n  between the two provinces was the same as that which had originally\r\n  separated Mauretania from Numidia (q.v.). These provinces were\r\n  governed until the time of Diocletian by imperial procurators, and\r\n  were occasionally united for military purposes. Under and after\r\n  Diocletian M. Tingitana was attached administratively to the\r\n  _dioicesis_ of Spain, with which it was in all respects closely\r\n  connected; while M. Caesariensis was divided by making its eastern\r\n  part into a separate government, which was called M. Sitifensis from\r\n  the Roman colony Sitifis.\r\n\r\n  In the two provinces of Mauretania there were at the time of Pliny a\r\n  number of towns, including seven (possibly eight) Roman colonies in M.\r\n  Tingitana and eleven in M. Caesariensis; others were added later.\r\n  These were mostly military foundations, and served the purpose of\r\n  securing civilization against the inroads of the natives, who were not\r\n  in a condition to be used as material for town-life as in Gaul and\r\n  Spain, but were under the immediate government of the procurators,\r\n  retaining their own clan organization. Of these colonies the most\r\n  important, beginning from the west, were Lixus on the Atlantic, Tingis\r\n  (Tangier), Rusaddir (Melila, Melilla), Cartenna (Tenes), Iol or\r\n  Caesarea (Cherchel), Icosium (Algiers), Saldae (Bougie), Igilgili\r\n  (Jijelli) and Sitifis (Setif). All these were on the coast but the\r\n  last, which was some distance inland. Besides these there were many\r\n  municipia or _oppida civium romanorum_ (Plin. 5. 19 seq.), but, as has\r\n  been made clear by French archaeologists who have explored these\r\n  regions, Roman settlements are less frequent the farther we go west,\r\n  and M. Tingitana has as yet yielded but scanty evidence of Roman\r\n  civilization. On the whole Mauretania was in a flourishing condition\r\n  down to the irruption of the Vandals in A.D. 429; in the _Notitia_\r\n  nearly a hundred and seventy episcopal sees are enumerated here, but\r\n  we must remember that numbers of these were mere villages.\r\n\r\n  In 1904 the term Mauretania was revived as an official designation by\r\n  the French government, and applied to the territory north of the lower\r\n  Senegal under French protection (see SENEGAL).\r\n\r\n  To the authorities quoted under AFRICA, ROMAN, may be added here\r\n  Göbel, _Die West-küste Afrikas im Alterthum_.     (W. W. F.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURIAC, a town of central France, capital of an arrondissement in the\r\ndepartment of Cantal, 39 m. N.N.W. of Aurillac by rail. Pop. (1906),\r\n2558. Mauriac, built on the slope of a volcanic hill, has a church of\r\nthe 12th century, and the buildings of an old abbey now used as public\r\noffices and dwellings; the town owes its origin to the abbey, founded\r\nduring the 6th century. It is the seat of a sub-prefect and has a\r\ntribunal of first instance and a communal college. There are marble\r\nquarries in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURICE [or MAURITIUS], ST (d. c. 286), an early Christian martyr, who,\r\nwith his companions, is commemorated by the Roman Catholic Church on the\r\n22nd of September. The oldest form of his story is found in the _Passio_\r\nascribed to Eucherius, bishop of Lyons, c. 450, who relates how the\r\n\"Theban\" legion commanded by Mauritius was sent to north Italy to\r\nreinforce the army of Maximinian. Maximinian wished to use them in\r\npersecuting the Christians, but as they themselves were of this faith,\r\nthey refused, and for this, after having been twice decimated, the\r\nlegion was exterminated at Octodurum (Martigny) near Geneva. In late\r\nversions this legend was expanded and varied, the martyrdom was\r\nconnected with a refusal to take part in a great sacrifice ordered at\r\nOctodurum and the name of Exsuperius was added to that of Mauritius.\r\nGregory of Tours (c. 539-593) speaks of a company of the same legion\r\nwhich suffered at Cologne.\r\n\r\n  The _Magdeburg Centuries_, in spite of Mauritius being the patron\r\n  saint of Magdeburg, declared the whole legend fictitious; J. A. du\r\n  Bordien _La Légion thébéenne_ (Amsterdam, 1705); J. J. Hottinger in\r\n  _Helvetische Kirchengeschichte_ (Zürich, 1708); and F. W. Rettberg,\r\n  _Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands_ (Göttingen, 1845-1848) have also\r\n  demonstrated its untrustworthiness, while the Bollandists, De Rivaz\r\n  and Joh. Friedrich uphold it. Apart from the a priori improbability of\r\n  a whole legion being martyred, the difficulties are that in 286\r\n  Christians everywhere throughout the empire were not molested, that at\r\n  no later date have we evidence of the presence of Maximinian in the\r\n  Valais, and that none of the writers nearest to the event (Eusebius,\r\n  Lactantius, Orosius, Sulpicius Severus) know anything of it. It is of\r\n  course quite possible that isolated cases of officers being put to\r\n  death for their faith occurred during Maximinian's reign, and on some\r\n  such cases the legend may have grown up during the century and a half\r\n  between Maximinian and Eucherius. The cult of St Maurice and the\r\n  Theban legion is found in Switzerland (where two places bear the name\r\n  in Valais, besides St Moritz in Grisons), along the Rhine, and in\r\n  north Italy. The foundation of the abbey of St Maurice (Agaunum) in\r\n  the Valais is usually ascribed to Sigismund of Burgundy (515). Relics\r\n  of the saint are preserved here and at Brieg and Turin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURICE (MAURICIUS FLAVIUS TIBERIUS) (c. 539-602), East Roman emperor\r\nfrom 582 to 602, was of Roman descent, but a native of Arabissus in\r\nCappadocia. He spent his youth at the court of Justin II., and, having\r\njoined the army, fought with distinction in the Persian War (578-581).\r\nAt the age of forty-three he was declared Caesar by the dying emperor\r\nTiberius II., who bestowed upon him the hand of his daughter\r\nConstantina. Maurice brought the Persian War to a successful close by\r\nthe restoration of Chosroes II. to the throne (591). On the northern\r\nfrontier he at first bought off the Avars by payments which compelled\r\nhim to exercise strict economy in his general administration, but after\r\n595 inflicted several defeats upon them through his general Crispus. By\r\nhis strict discipline and his refusal to ransom a captive corps he\r\nprovoked to mutiny the army on the Danube. The revolt spread to the\r\npopular factions in Constantinople, and Maurice consented to abdicate.\r\nHe withdrew to Chalcedon, but was hunted down and put to death after\r\nwitnessing the slaughter of his five sons.\r\n\r\n  The work on military art ([Greek: stratêgika]) ascribed to him is a\r\n  contemporary work of unknown authorship (ed. Scheffer, _Arriani\r\n  tactica et Mauricii ars militaris_, Upsala, 1664; see Max Jähns,\r\n  _Gesch. d. Kriegswissensch._, i. 152-156).\r\n\r\n  See Theophylactus Simocatta, _Vita Mauricii_ (ed. de Boor, 1887); E.\r\n  Gibbon, _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ (ed. Bury, London,\r\n  1896, v. 19-21, 57); J. B. Bury, _The Later Roman Empire_ (London,\r\n  1889, ii. 83-94); G. Finlay, _History of Greece_ (ed. 1877, Oxford, i.\r\n  299-306).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURICE (1521-1553), elector of Saxony, elder son of Henry, duke of\r\nSaxony, belonging to the Albertine branch of the Wettin family, was born\r\nat Freiberg on the 21st of March 1521. In January 1541 he married Agnes,\r\ndaughter of Philip, landgrave of Hesse. In that year he became duke of\r\nSaxony by his father's death, and he continued Henry's work in\r\nforwarding the progress of the Reformation. Duke Henry had decreed that\r\nhis lands should be divided between his two sons, but as a partition was\r\nregarded as undesirable the whole of the duchy came to his elder son.\r\nMaurice, however, made generous provision for his brother Augustus, and\r\nthe desire to compensate him still further was one of the minor threads\r\nof his subsequent policy. In 1542 he assisted the emperor Charles V.\r\nagainst the Turks, in 1543 against William, duke of Cleves, and in 1544\r\nagainst the French; but his ambition soon took a wider range. The\r\nharmonious relations which subsisted between the two branches of the\r\nWettins were disturbed by the interference of Maurice in Cleves, a\r\nproceeding distasteful to the Saxon elector, John Frederick; and a\r\ndispute over the bishopric of Meissen having widened the breach, war was\r\nonly averted by the mediation of Philip of Hesse and Luther. About this\r\ntime Maurice seized the idea of securing for himself the electoral\r\ndignity held by John Frederick, and his opportunity came when Charles\r\nwas preparing to attack the league of Schmalkalden. Although educated as\r\na Lutheran, religious questions had never seriously appealed to Maurice.\r\nAs a youth he had joined the league of Schmalkalden, but this adhesion,\r\nas well as his subsequent declaration to stand by the confession of\r\nAugsburg, cannot be regarded as the decision of his maturer years. In\r\nJune 1546 he took a decided step by making a secret agreement with\r\nCharles at Regensburg. Maurice was promised some rights over the\r\narchbishopric of Magdeburg and the bishopric of Halberstadt; immunity,\r\nin part at least, for his subjects from the Tridentine decrees; and the\r\nquestion of transferring the electoral dignity was discussed. In return\r\nthe duke probably agreed to aid Charles in his proposed attack on the\r\nleague as soon as he could gain the consent of the Saxon estates, or at\r\nall events to remain neutral during the impending war. The struggle\r\nbegan in July 1546, and in October Maurice declared war against John\r\nFrederick. He secured the formal consent of Charles to the transfer of\r\nthe electoral dignity and took the field in November. He had gained a\r\nfew successes when John Frederick hastened from south Germany to defend\r\nhis dominions. Maurice's ally, Albert Alcibiades, prince of Bayreuth,\r\nwas taken prisoner at Rochlitz; and the duke, driven from electoral\r\nSaxony, was unable to prevent his own lands from being overrun.\r\nSalvation, however, was at hand. Marching against John Frederick,\r\nCharles V., aided by Maurice, gained a decisive victory at Mühlberg in\r\nApril 1547, after which by the capitulation of Wittenberg John Frederick\r\nrenounced the electoral dignity in favour of Maurice, who also obtained\r\na large part of his kinsman's lands. The formal investiture of the new\r\nelector took place at Augsburg in February 1548.\r\n\r\nThe plans of Maurice soon took a form less agreeable to the emperor. The\r\ncontinued imprisonment of his father-in-law, Philip of Hesse, whom he\r\nhad induced to surrender to Charles and whose freedom he had guaranteed,\r\nwas neither his greatest nor his only cause of complaint. The emperor\r\nhad refused to complete the humiliation of the family of John Frederick;\r\nhe had embarked upon a course of action which boded danger to the\r\nelector's Lutheran subjects, and his increased power was a menace to the\r\nposition of Maurice. Assuring Charles of his continued loyalty, the\r\nelector entered into negotiations with the discontented Protestant\r\nprinces. An event happened which gave him a base of operations, and\r\nenabled him to mask his schemes against the emperor. In 1550 he had been\r\nentrusted with the execution of the imperial ban against the city of\r\nMagdeburg, and under cover of these operations he was able to collect\r\ntroops and to concert measures with his allies. Favourable terms were\r\ngranted to Magdeburg, which surrendered and remained in the power of\r\nMaurice, and in January 1552 a treaty was concluded with Henry II. of\r\nFrance at Chambord. Meanwhile Maurice had refused to recognize the\r\n_Interim_ issued from Augsburg in May 1548 as binding on Saxony; but a\r\ncompromise was arranged on the basis of which the Leipzig _Interim_ was\r\ndrawn up for his lands. It is uncertain how far Charles was ignorant of\r\nthe elector's preparations, but certainly he was unprepared for the\r\nattack made by Maurice and his allies in March 1552. Augsburg was taken,\r\nthe pass of Ehrenberg was forced, and in a few days the emperor left\r\nInnsbruck as a fugitive. Ferdinand undertook to make peace, and the\r\nTreaty of Passau, signed in August 1552, was the result. Maurice\r\nobtained a general amnesty and freedom for Philip of Hesse, but was\r\nunable to obtain a perpetual religious peace for the Lutherans. Charles\r\nstubbornly insisted that this question must be referred to the Diet, and\r\nMaurice was obliged to give way. He then fought against the Turks, and\r\nrenewed his communications with Henry of France. Returning from Hungary\r\nthe elector placed himself at the head of the princes who were seeking\r\nto check the career of his former ally, Albert Alcibiades, whose\r\ndepredations were making him a curse to Germany. The rival armies met at\r\nSievershausen on the 9th of July 1553, where after a fierce encounter\r\nAlbert was defeated. The victor, however, was wounded during the fight\r\nand died two days later.\r\n\r\nMaurice was a friend to learning, and devoted some of the secularized\r\nchurch property to the advancement of education. Very different\r\nestimates have been formed of his character. He has been represented as\r\nthe saviour of German Protestantism on the one hand, and on the other as\r\na traitor to his faith and country. In all probability he was neither\r\nthe one nor the other, but a man of great ambition who, indifferent to\r\nreligious considerations, made good use of the exigencies of the time.\r\nHe was generous and enlightened, a good soldier and a clever\r\ndiplomatist. He left an only daughter Anna (d. 1577), who became the\r\nsecond wife of William the Silent, prince of Orange.\r\n\r\n  The elector's _Politische Korrespondenz_ has been edited by E.\r\n  Brandenburg (Leipzig, 1900-1904); and a sketch of him is given by\r\n  Roger Ascham in _A Report and Discourse of the Affairs and State of\r\n  Germany_ (London, 1864-1865).

He was the son\r\nof a Unitarian minister, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in\r\n1823, though it was then impossible for any but members of the\r\nEstablished Church to obtain a degree. Together with John Sterling (with\r\nwhom he founded the Apostles' Club) he migrated to Trinity Hall, whence\r\nhe obtained a first class in civil law in 1827; he then came to London,\r\nand gave himself to literary work, writing a novel, _Eustace Conyers_,\r\nand editing the _London Literary Chronicle_ until 1830, and also for a\r\nshort time the _Athenaeum_. At this time he was much perplexed as to his\r\nreligious opinions, and he ultimately found relief in a decision to take\r\na further university course and to seek Anglican orders. Entering Exeter\r\nCollege, Oxford, he took a second class in classics in 1831. He was\r\nordained in 1834, and after a short curacy at Bubbenhall in Warwickshire\r\nwas appointed chaplain of Guy's Hospital, and became thenceforward a\r\nsensible factor in the intellectual and social life of London. From 1839\r\nto 1841 Maurice was editor of the _Education Magazine_. In 1840 he was\r\nappointed professor of English history and literature in King's College,\r\nand to this post in 1846 was added the chair of divinity. In 1845 he was\r\nBoyle lecturer and Warburton lecturer. These chairs he held till 1853.\r\nIn that year he published _Theological Essays_, wherein were stated\r\nopinions which savoured to the principal, Dr R. W. Jelf, and to the\r\ncouncil, of unsound theology in regard to eternal punishment. He had\r\npreviously been called on to clear himself from charges of heterodoxy\r\nbrought against him in the _Quarterly Review_ (1851), and had been\r\nacquitted by a committee of inquiry. Now again he maintained with great\r\nwarmth of conviction that his views were in close accordance with\r\nScripture and the Anglican standards, but the council, without\r\nspecifying any distinct \"heresy\" and declining to submit the case to the\r\njudgment of competent theologians, ruled otherwise, and he was deprived\r\nof his professorships. He held at the same time the chaplaincy of\r\nLincoln's Inn, for which he had resigned Guy's (1846-1860), but when he\r\noffered to resign this the benchers refused. Nor was he assailed in the\r\nincumbency of St. Peter's, Vere Street, which he held for nine years\r\n(1860-1869), and where he drew round him a circle of thoughtful people.\r\nDuring the early years of this period he was engaged in a hot and bitter\r\ncontroversy with H. L. Mansel (afterwards dean of St Paul's), arising\r\nout of the latter's Bampton lecture upon reason and revelation.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in London Maurice was specially identified with two\r\nimportant movements for education. He helped to found Queen's College\r\nfor the education of women (1848), and the Working Men's College (1854),\r\nof which he was the first principal. He strongly advocated the abolition\r\nof university tests (1853), and threw himself with great energy into all\r\nthat affected the social life of the people. Certain abortive attempts\r\nat co-operation among working men, and the movement known as Christian\r\nSocialism, were the immediate outcome of his teaching. In 1866 Maurice\r\nwas appointed professor of moral philosophy at Cambridge, and from 1870\r\nto 1872 was incumbent of St Edward's in that city. He died on the 1st of\r\nApril 1872.\r\n\r\nHe was twice married, first to Anna Barton, a sister of John Sterling's\r\nwife, secondly to a half-sister of his friend Archdeacon Hare. His son\r\nMajor-General Sir J. Frederick Maurice (b. 1841), became a distinguished\r\nsoldier and one of the most prominent military writers of his time.\r\n\r\nThose who knew Maurice best were deeply impressed with the spirituality\r\nof his character. \"Whenever he woke in the night,\" says his wife, \"he\r\nwas always praying.\" Charles Kingsley called him \"the most beautiful\r\nhuman soul whom God has ever allowed me to meet with.\" As regards his\r\nintellectual attainments we may set Julius Hare's verdict \"the greatest\r\nmind since Plato\" over against Ruskin's \"by nature puzzle-headed and\r\nindeed wrong-headed.\" Such contradictory impressions bespeak a life made\r\nup of contradictory elements. Maurice was a man of peace, yet his life\r\nwas spent in a series of conflicts; of deep humility, yet so polemical\r\nthat he often seemed biased; of large charity, yet bitter in his attack\r\nupon the religious press of his time; a loyal churchman who detested the\r\nlabel \"Broad,\" yet poured out criticism upon the leaders of the Church.\r\nWith an intense capacity for visualizing the unseen, and a kindly\r\ndignity, he combined a large sense of humour. While most of the \"Broad\r\nChurchmen\" were influenced by ethical and emotional considerations in\r\ntheir repudiation of the dogma of everlasting torment, he was swayed by\r\npurely intellectual and theological arguments, and in questions of a\r\nmore general liberty he often opposed the proposed Liberal theologians,\r\nthough he as often took their side if he saw them hard pressed. He had a\r\nwide metaphysical and philosophical knowledge which he applied to the\r\nhistory of theology. He was a strenuous advocate of ecclesiastical\r\ncontrol in elementary education, and an opponent of the new school of\r\nhigher biblical criticism, though so far an evolutionist as to believe\r\nin growth and development as applied to the history of nations.\r\n\r\n  As a preacher, his message was apparently simple; his two great\r\n  convictions were the fatherhood of God, and that all religious systems\r\n  which had any stability lasted because of a portion of truth which had\r\n  to be disentangled from the error differentiating them from the\r\n  doctrines of the Church of England as understood by himself. His love\r\n  to God as his Father was a passionate adoration which filled his whole\r\n  heart. The prophetic, even apocalyptic, note of his preaching was\r\n  particularly impressive. He prophesied in London as Isaiah prophesied\r\n  to the little towns of Palestine and Syria, \"often with dark\r\n  foreboding, but seeing through all unrest and convulsion the working\r\n  out of a sure divine purpose.\" Both at King's College and at Cambridge\r\n  Maurice gathered round him a band of earnest students, to whom he\r\n  directly taught much that was valuable drawn from wide stores of his\r\n  own reading, wide rather than deep, for he never was, strictly\r\n  speaking, a learned man. Still more did he encourage the habit of\r\n  inquiry and research, more valuable than his direct teaching. In his\r\n  Socratic power of convincing his pupils of their ignorance he did more\r\n  than perhaps any other man of his time to awaken in those who came\r\n  under his sway the desire for knowledge and the process of independent\r\n  thought.\r\n\r\n  As a social reformer, Maurice was before his time, and gave his eager\r\n  support to schemes for which the world was not ready. From an early\r\n  period of his life in London the condition of the poor pressed upon\r\n  him with consuming force; the enormous magnitude of the social\r\n  questions involved was a burden which he could hardly bear. For many\r\n  years he was the clergyman whom working men of all opinions seemed to\r\n  trust even if their faith in other religious men and all religious\r\n  systems had faded, and he had a marvellous power of attracting the\r\n  zealot and the outcast.\r\n\r\n  His works cover nearly 40 volumes, often obscure, often tautological,\r\n  and with no great distinction of style. But their high purpose and\r\n  philosophical outlook give his writings a permanent place in the\r\n  history of the thought of his time. The following are the more\r\n  important works--some of them were rewritten and in a measure recast,\r\n  and the date given is not necessarily that of the first appearance of\r\n  the book, but of its more complete and abiding form: _Eustace Conway,\r\n  or the Brother and Sister_, a novel (1834); _The Kingdom of Christ_\r\n  (1842); _Christmas Day and Other Sermons_ (1843); _The Unity of the\r\n  New Testament_ (1844); _The Epistle to the Hebrews_ (1846); _The\r\n  Religions of the World_ (1847); _Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy_\r\n  (at first an article in the _Encyclopaedia Metropolitana_, 1848); _The\r\n  Church a Family_ (1850); _The Old Testament_ (1851); _Theological\r\n  Essays_ (1853); _The Prophets and Kings of the Old Testament_ (1853);\r\n  _Lectures on Ecclesiastical History_ (1854); _The Doctrine of\r\n  Sacrifice_ (1854); _The Patriarchs and Lawgivers of the Old Testament_\r\n  (1855); _The Epistles of St John_ (1857); _The Commandments as\r\n  Instruments of National Reformation_ (1866); _On the Gospel of St\r\n  Luke_ (1868); _The Conscience: Lectures on Casuistry_ (1868); _The\r\n  Lord's Prayer, a Manual_ (1870). The greater part of these works were\r\n  first delivered as sermons or lectures. Maurice also contributed many\r\n  prefaces and introductions to the works of friends, as to Archdeacon\r\n  Hare's _Charges_, Kingsley's _Saint's Tragedy_, &c.\r\n\r\n  See _Life_ by his son (2 vols., London, 1884), and a monograph by C.\r\n  F. G. Masterman (1907) in \"Leader of the Church\" series; W. E. Collins\r\n  in _Typical English Churchmen_, pp. 327-360 (1902), and T. Hughes in\r\n  _The Friendship of Books_ (1873).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURICE OF NASSAU, prince of Orange (1567-1625), the second son of\r\nWilliam the Silent, by Anna, only daughter of the famous Maurice,\r\nelector of Saxony, was born at Dillenburg. At the time of his father's\r\nassassination in 1584 he was being educated at the university of Leiden,\r\nat the expense of the states of Holland and Zeeland. Despite his youth\r\nhe was made stadtholder of those two provinces and president of the\r\ncouncil of state. During the period of Leicester's governorship he\r\nremained in the background, engaged in acquiring a thorough knowledge of\r\nthe military art, and in 1586 the States of Holland conferred upon him\r\nthe title of prince. On the withdrawal of Leicester from the Netherlands\r\nin August 1587, Johan van Oldenbarneveldt, the advocate of Holland,\r\nbecame the leading statesman of the country, a position which he\r\nretained for upwards of thirty years. He had been a devoted adherent of\r\nWilliam the Silent and he now used his influence to forward the\r\ninterests of Maurice. In 1588 he was appointed by the States-General\r\ncaptain and admiral-general of the Union, in 1590 he was elected\r\nstadtholder of Utrecht and Overysel, and in 1591 of Gelderland. From\r\nthis time forward, Oldenbarneveldt at the head of the civil government\r\nand Maurice in command of the armed forces of the republic worked\r\ntogether in the task of rescuing the United Netherlands from Spanish\r\ndomination (for details see HOLLAND). Maurice soon showed himself to be\r\na general second in skill to none of his contemporaries. He was\r\nespecially famed for his consummate knowledge of the science of sieges.\r\nThe twelve years' truce on the 9th of April 1609 brought to an end the\r\ncordial relations between Maurice and Oldenbarneveldt. Maurice was\r\nopposed to the truce, but the advocate's policy triumphed and\r\nhenceforward there was enmity between them. The theological disputes\r\nbetween the Remonstrants and contra-Remonstrants found them on different\r\nsides; and the theological quarrel soon became a political one.\r\nOldenbarneveldt, supported by the states of Holland, came forward as the\r\nchampion of provincial sovereignty against that of the states-general;\r\nMaurice threw the weight of his sword on the side of the union. The\r\nstruggle was a short one, for the army obeyed the general who had so\r\noften led them to victory. Oldenbarneveldt perished on the scaffold, and\r\nthe share which Maurice had in securing the illegal condemnation by a\r\npacked court of judges of the aged patriot must ever remain a stain upon\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\nMaurice, who had on the death of his elder brother Philip William, in\r\nFebruary 1618, become prince of Orange, was now supreme in the state,\r\nbut during the remainder of his life he sorely missed the wise counsels\r\nof the experienced Oldenbarneveldt. War broke out again in 1621, but\r\nsuccess had ceased to accompany him on his campaigns. His health gave\r\nway, and he died, a prematurely aged man, at the Hague on the 4th of\r\nApril 1625. He was buried by his father's side at Delft.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--I. Commelin, _Wilhelm en Maurits v. Nassau, pr. v.\r\n  Orangien, haer leven en bedrijf_ (Amsterdam, 1651); G.

In the abbey of St Vaune near Verdun a\r\nreform was initiated by Dom Didier de la Cour, which spread to other\r\nhouses in Lorraine, and in 1604 the reformed congregation of St Vaune\r\nwas established, the most distinguished members of which were Ceillier\r\nand Calmet. A number of French houses joined the new congregation; but\r\nas Lorraine was still independent of the French crown, it was considered\r\ndesirable to form on the same lines a separate congregation for France.\r\nThus in 1621 was established the famous French congregation of St Maur.\r\nMost of the Benedictine monasteries of France, except those belonging to\r\nCluny, gradually joined the new congregation, which eventually embraced\r\nnearly two hundred houses. The chief house was Saint-Germain-des-Prés,\r\nParis, the residence of the superior-general and centre of the literary\r\nactivity of the congregation. The primary idea of the movement was not\r\nthe undertaking of literary and historical work, but the return to a\r\nstrict monastic régime and the faithful carrying out of Benedictine\r\nlife; and throughout the most glorious period of Maurist history the\r\nliterary work was not allowed to interfere with the due performance of\r\nthe choral office and the other duties of the monastic life. Towards the\r\nend of the 18th century a tendency crept in, in some quarters, to relax\r\nthe monastic observances in favour of study; but the constitutions of\r\n1770 show that a strict monastic régime was maintained until the end.\r\nThe course of Maurist history and work was checkered by the\r\necclesiastical controversies that distracted the French Church during\r\nthe 17th and 18th centuries. Some of the members identified themselves\r\nwith the Jansenist cause; but the bulk, including nearly all the\r\ngreatest names, pursued a middle path, opposing the lax moral theology\r\ncondemned in 1679 by Pope Innocent XI., and adhering to those strong\r\nviews on grace and predestination associated with the Augustinian and\r\nThomist schools of Catholic theology; and like all the theological\r\nfaculties and schools on French soil, they were bound to teach the four\r\nGallican articles. It seems that towards the end of the 18th century a\r\nrationalistic and free-thinking spirit invaded some of the houses. The\r\ncongregation was suppressed and the monks scattered at the revolution,\r\nthe last superior-general with forty of his monks dying on the scaffold\r\nin Paris. The present French congregation of Benedictines initiated by\r\nDom Guéranger in 1833 is a new creation and has no continuity with the\r\ncongregation of St Maur.\r\n\r\nThe great claim of the Maurists to the gratitude and admiration of\r\nposterity is their historical and critical school, which stands quite\r\nalone in history, and produced an extraordinary number of colossal works\r\nof erudition which still are of permanent value. The foundations of this\r\nschool were laid by Dom Tarisse, the first superior-general, who in 1632\r\nissued instructions to the superiors of the monasteries to train the\r\nyoung monks in the habits of research and of organized work. The\r\npioneers in production were Ménard and d'Achery.\r\n\r\n  The following tables give, divided into groups, the most important\r\n  Maurist works, along with such information as may be useful to\r\n  students.

The full Maurist bibliography contains the names of\r\n  some 220 writers and more than 700 works. The lesser works in large\r\n  measure cover the same fields as those in the list, but the number of\r\n  works of purely religious character, of piety, devotion and\r\n  edification, is very striking. Perhaps the most wonderful phenomenon\r\n  of Maurist work is that what was produced was only a portion of what\r\n  was contemplated and prepared for. The French Revolution cut short\r\n  many gigantic undertakings, the collected materials for which fill\r\n  hundreds of manuscript volumes in the Bibliothèque nationale of Paris\r\n  and other libraries of France. There are at Paris 31 volumes of\r\n  Berthereau's materials for the Historians of the Crusades, not only in\r\n  Latin and Greek, but in the oriental tongues; from them have been\r\n  taken in great measure the _Recueil des historiens des croisades_,\r\n  whereof 15 folio volumes have been published by the Académie des\r\n  Inscriptions. There exist also the preparations for an edition of\r\n  Rufinus and one of Eusebius, and for the continuation of the Papal\r\n  Letters and of the Concilia Galliae. Dom Caffiaux and Dom Villevielle\r\n  left 236 volumes of materials for a _Trésor généalogique_. There are\r\n  Benedictine Antiquities (37 vols.), a Monasticon Gallicanum and a\r\n  Monasticon Benedictinum (54 vols.). Of the Histories of the Provinces\r\n  of France barely half a dozen were printed, but all were in hand, and\r\n  the collections for the others fill 800 volumes of MSS. The materials\r\n  for a geography of Gaul and France in 50 volumes perished in a fire\r\n  during the Revolution.\r\n\r\n  When these figures were considered, and when one contemplates the\r\n  vastness of the works in progress during any decade of the century\r\n  1680-1780; and still more, when not only the quantity but the quality\r\n  of the work, and the abiding value of most of it is realized, it will\r\n  be recognized that the output was prodigious and unique in the history\r\n  of letters, as coming from a single society. The qualities that have\r\n  made Maurist work proverbial for sound learning are its fine critical\r\n  tact and its thoroughness.\r\n\r\n  The chief source of information on the Maurists and their work is Dom\r\n  Tassin's _Histoire littéraire de la congregation de Saint-Maur_\r\n  (1770); it has been reduced to a bare bibliography and completed by de\r\n  Lama, _Bibliothèque des écrivains de la congr. de S.-M._ (1882). The\r\n  two works of de Broglie, _Mabillon_ (2 vols., 1888) and _Montfaucon_\r\n  (2 vols., 1891), give a charming picture of the inner life of the\r\n  great Maurists of the earlier generation in the midst of their work\r\n  and their friends. Sketches of the lives of a few of the chief\r\n  Maurists will be found in McCarthy's _Principal Writers of the Congr.\r\n  of S. M._ (1868). Useful information about their literary undertakings\r\n  will be found in De Lisle's _Cabinet des MSS. de la Bibl. Nat. Fonds\r\n  St Germain-des-Prés_. General information will be found in the\r\n  standard authorities: Helyot, _Hist. des ordres religieux_ (1718), vi.\r\n  c. 37; Heimbucher, _Orden und Kongregationen_ (1907) i. § 36; Wetzer\r\n  und Welte, Kirchenlexicon (ed. 2) and Herzog-Hauck's\r\n  _Realencyklopädie_ (ed. 3), the latter an interesting appreciation by\r\n  the Protestant historian Otto Zöckler of the spirit and the merits of\r\n  the work of the Maurists.     (E. C. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] His festival is kept on the 15th of January. He founded the\r\n    monastery of Glanfeuil or St Maur-sur-Loire.\r\n\r\n  [2] 14 vols. of materials collected for the continuation are at\r\n    Paris.\r\n\r\n  [3] The printing of vol. ii. was impeded by the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURITIUS, an island and British colony in the Indian Ocean (known\r\nwhilst a French possession as the _Île de France_). It lies between 57°\r\n18´ and 57° 49´ E., and 19° 58´ and 20° 32´ S., 550 m. E. of Madagascar,\r\n2300 m. from the Cape of Good Hope, and 9500 m. from England via Suez.\r\nThe island is irregularly elliptical--somewhat triangular--in shape, and\r\nis 36 m. long from N.N.E. to S.S.W., and about 23 m. broad. It is 130 m.\r\nin circumference, and its total area is about 710 sq. m. (For map see\r\nMADAGASCAR.) The island is surrounded by coral reefs, so that the ports\r\nare difficult of access.\r\n\r\nFrom its mountainous character Mauritius is a most picturesque island,\r\nand its scenery is very varied and beautiful. It has been admirably\r\ndescribed by Bernardin de St Pierre, who lived in the island towards the\r\nclose of the 18th century, in _Paul et Virginie_. The most level\r\nportions of the coast districts are the north and north-east, all the\r\nrest being broken by hills, which vary from 500 to 2700 ft. in height.\r\nThe principal mountain masses are the north-western or Pouce range, in\r\nthe district of Port Louis; the south-western, in the districts of\r\nRivière Noire and Savanne; and the south-eastern range, in the Grand\r\nPort district. In the first of these, which consists of one principal\r\nridge with several lateral spurs, overlooking Port Louis, are the\r\nsingular peak of the Pouce (2650 ft.), so called from its supposed\r\nresemblance to the human thumb; and the still loftier Pieter Botte (2685\r\nft.), a tall obelisk of bare rock, crowned with a globular mass of\r\nstone. The highest summit in the island is in the south-western mass of\r\nhills, the Piton de la Rivière Noire, which is 2711 ft. above the sea.\r\nThe south-eastern group of hills consists of the Montagne du Bambou,\r\nwith several spurs running down to the sea. In the interior are\r\nextensive fertile plains, some 1200 ft. in height, forming the districts\r\nof Moka, Vacois, and Plaines Wilhelms; and from nearly the centre of the\r\nisland an abrupt peak, the Piton du Milieu de l'Île rises to a height of\r\n1932 ft. Other prominent summits are the Trois Mamelles, the Montagne du\r\nCorps de Garde, the Signal Mountain, near Port Louis, and the Morne\r\nBrabant, at the south-west corner of the island.\r\n\r\nThe rivers are small, and none is navigable beyond a few hundred yards\r\nfrom the sea. In the dry season little more than brooks, they become\r\nraging torrents in the wet season. The principal stream is the Grande\r\nRivière, with a course of about 10 m. There is a remarkable and very\r\ndeep lake, called Grand Bassin, in the south of the island, it is\r\nprobably the extinct crater of an ancient volcano; similar lakes are the\r\nMare aux Vacois and the Mare aux Joncs, and there are other deep hollows\r\nwhich have a like origin.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--The island is of volcanic origin, but has ceased to show\r\n  signs of volcanic activity. All the rocks are of basalt and\r\n  greyish-tinted lavas, excepting some beds of upraised coral. Columnar\r\n  basalt is seen in several places. The remains of ancient craters can\r\n  be distinguished, but their outlines have been greatly destroyed by\r\n  denudation. There are many caverns and steep ravines, and from the\r\n  character of the rocks the ascents are rugged and precipitous. The\r\n  island has few minerals, although iron, lead and copper in very small\r\n  quantities have in former times been obtained. The greater part of the\r\n  surface is composed of a volcanic breccia, with here and there\r\n  lava-streams exposed in ravines, and sometimes on the surface. The\r\n  commonest lavas are dolerites. In at least two places sedimentary\r\n  rocks are found at considerable elevations. In the Black River\r\n  Mountains, at a height of about 1200 ft., there is a clay-slate; and\r\n  near Midlands, in the Grand Port group of mountains, a chloritic\r\n  schist occurs about 1700 ft. above the sea, forming the hill of La\r\n  Selle. This schist is much contorted, but seems to have a general dip\r\n  to the south or south-east. Evidence of recent elevation of the island\r\n  is furnished by masses of coral reef and beach coral rock standing at\r\n  heights of 40 ft. above sea-level in the south, 12 ft. in the north\r\n  and 7 ft. on the islands situated on the bank extending to the\r\n  north-east.[1]\r\n\r\n  _Climate._--The climate is pleasant during the cool season of the\r\n  year, but oppressively hot in summer (December to April), except in\r\n  the elevated plains of the interior, where the thermometer ranges from\r\n  70° to 80° F., while in Port Louis and on the coast generally it\r\n  ranges from 90° to 96°. The mean temperature for the year at Port\r\n  Louis is 78.6°. There are two seasons, the cool and comparatively dry\r\n  season, from April to November, and the hotter season, during the rest\r\n  of the year. The climate is now less healthy than it was, severe\r\n  epidemics of malarial fever having frequently occurred, so that\r\n  malaria now appears to be endemic among the non-European population.\r\n  The rainfall varies greatly in different parts of the island. Cluny in\r\n  the Grand Port (south-eastern) district has a mean annual rainfall of\r\n  145 in.; Albion on the west coast is the driest station, with a mean\r\n  annual rainfall of 31 in. The mean monthly rainfall for the whole\r\n  island varies from 12 in. in March to 2.6 in. in September and\r\n  October. The Royal Alfred Observatory is situated at Pamplemousses, on\r\n  the north-west or dry side of the island. From January to the middle\r\n  of April, Mauritius, in common with the neighbouring islands and the\r\n  surrounding ocean from 8° to 30° of southern latitude is subject to\r\n  severe cyclones, accompanied by torrents of rain, which often cause\r\n  great destruction to houses and plantations. These hurricanes\r\n  generally last about eight hours, but they appear to be less frequent\r\n  and violent than in former times, owing, it is thought, to the\r\n  destruction of the ancient forests and the consequent drier condition\r\n  of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n  _Fauna and Flora._--Mauritius being an oceanic island of small size,\r\n  its present fauna is very limited in extent. When first seen by\r\n  Europeans it contained no mammals except a large fruit-eating bat\r\n  (_Pteropus vulgaris_), which is plentiful in the woods; but several\r\n  mammals have been introduced, and are now numerous in the uncultivated\r\n  region. Among these are two monkeys of the genera _Macacus_ and\r\n  _Cercopithecus_, a stag (_Cervus hippelaphus_), a small hare, a\r\n  shrew-mouse, and the ubiquitous rat. A lemur and one of the curious\r\n  hedgehog-like _Insectivora_ of Madagascar (_Centetes ecaudatus_) have\r\n  probably both been brought from the larger island. The avifauna\r\n  resembles that of Madagascar; there are species of a peculiar genus of\r\n  caterpillar shrikes (_Campephagidae_), as well as of the genera\r\n  _Pratincola_, _Hypsipetes_, _Phedina_, _Tchitrea_, _Zosterops_,\r\n  _Foudia_, _Collocalia_ and _Coracopsis_, and peculiar forms of doves\r\n  and parakeets. The living reptiles are small and few in number. The\r\n  surrounding seas contain great numbers of fish; the coral reefs abound\r\n  with a great variety of molluscs; and there are numerous land-shells.\r\n  The extinct fauna of Mauritius has considerable interest. In common\r\n  with the other Mascarene islands, it was the home of the dodo (_Didus\r\n  ineptus_); there were also _Aphanapteryx_, a species of rail, and a\r\n  short-winged heron (_Ardea megacephala_), which probably seldom flew.\r\n  The defenceless condition of these birds led to their extinction after\r\n  the island was colonized. Considerable quantities of the bones of the\r\n  dodo and other extinct birds--a rail (_Aphanapteryx_), and a\r\n  short-winged heron--have been discovered in the beds of some of the\r\n  ancient lakes (see DODO). Several species of large fossil tortoises\r\n  have also been discovered; they are quite different from the living\r\n  ones of Aldabra, in the same zoological region.\r\n\r\n  Owing to the destruction of the primeval forests for the formation of\r\n  sugar plantations, the indigenous flora is only seen in parts of the\r\n  interior plains, in the river valleys and on the hills; and it is not\r\n  now easy to distinguish between what is native and what has come from\r\n  abroad. The principal timber tree is the ebony (_Diospyros ebeneum_),\r\n  which grows to a considerable size. Besides this there are bois de\r\n  cannelle, olive-tree, benzoin (_Croton Benzoe_), colophane\r\n  (_Colophonia_), and iron-wood, all of which arc useful in carpentry;\r\n  the coco-nut palm, an importation, but a tree which has been so\r\n  extensively planted during the last hundred years that it is extremely\r\n  plentiful; the palmiste (_Palma dactylifera latifolia_), the latanier\r\n  (_Corypha umbraculifera_) and the date-palm. The vacoa or vacois,\r\n  (_Pandanus utilis_) is largely grown, the long tough leaves being\r\n  manufactured into bags for the export of sugar, and the roots being\r\n  also made of use; and in the few remnants of the original forests the\r\n  traveller's tree (_Urania speciosa_), grows abundantly. A species of\r\n  bamboo is very plentiful in the river valleys and in marshy\r\n  situations. A large variety of fruit is produced, including the\r\n  tamarind, mango, banana, pine-apple, guava, shaddock, fig,\r\n  avocado-pear, litchi, custard-apple and the mabolo (_Diospyros\r\n  discolor_), a fruit of exquisite flavour, but very disagreeable odour.\r\n  Many of the roots and vegetables of Europe have been introduced, as\r\n  well as some of those peculiar to the tropics, including maize,\r\n  millet, yams, manioc, dhol, gram, &c. Small quantities of tea, rice\r\n  and sago, have been grown, as well as many of the spices (cloves,\r\n  nutmeg, ginger, pepper and allspice), and also cotton, indigo, betel,\r\n  camphor, turmeric and vanilla. The Royal Botanical Gardens at\r\n  Pamplemousses, which date from the French occupation of the island,\r\n  contain a rich collection of tropical and extra-tropical species.\r\n\r\n_Inhabitants._--The inhabitants consist of two great divisions, those of\r\nEuropean blood, chiefly French and British, together with numerous\r\nhalf-caste people, and those of Asiatic or African blood. The population\r\nof European blood, which calls itself Creole, is greater than that of\r\nany other tropical colony; many of the inhabitants trace their descent\r\nfrom ancient French families, and the higher and middle classes are\r\ndistinguished for their intellectual culture. French is more commonly\r\nspoken than English. The Creole class is, however, diminishing, though\r\nslowly, and the most numerous section of the population is of Indian\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n  The introduction of Indian coolies to work the sugar plantations dates\r\n  from the period of the emancipation of the slaves in 1834-1839. At\r\n  that time the negroes who showed great unwillingness to work on their\r\n  late masters' estates, numbered about 66,000. Immigration from India\r\n  began in 1834, and at a census taken in 1846, when the total\r\n  population was 158,462, there were already 56,245 Indians in the\r\n  island. In 1851 the total population had increased to 180,823, while\r\n  in 1861 it was 310,050. This great increase was almost entirely due to\r\n  Indian immigration, the Indian population, 77,996 in 1851, being\r\n  192,634 in 1861. From that year the increase in the Indian population\r\n  has been more gradual but steady, while the non-Indian population has\r\n  decreased. From 102,827 in 1851 it rose to 117,416 in 1861 to sink to\r\n  99,784 in 1871. The figures for the three following census years\r\n  were:--\r\n\r\n                 1881.      1891.      1901.\r\n\r\n    Indians    248,993    255,920    259,086\r\n    Others     110,881    114,668    111,937\r\n               -------    -------    -------\r\n      Total    359,874    370,588    371,023\r\n               -------    -------    -------\r\n\r\n  Including the military and crews of ships in harbour, the total\r\n  population in 1901 was 373,336.[2] This total included 198,958\r\n  Indo-Mauritians, i.e. persons of Indian descent born in Mauritius, and\r\n  62,022 other Indians. There were 3,509 Chinese, while the remaining\r\n  108,847 included persons of European, African or mixed descent,\r\n  Malagasy, Malays and Sinhalese. The Indian female population increased\r\n  from 51,019 in 1861 to 115,986 in 1901. In the same period the\r\n  non-Indian female population but slightly varied, being 56,070 in 1861\r\n  and 55,485 in 1901. The Indo-Mauritians are now dominant in\r\n  commercial, agricultural and domestic callings, and much town and\r\n  agricultural land has been transferred from the Creole planters to\r\n  Indians and Chinese. The tendency to an Indian peasant proprietorship\r\n  is marked. Since 1864 real property to the value of over £1,250,000\r\n  has been acquired by Asiatics. Between 1881 and 1901 the number of\r\n  sugar estates decreased from 171 to 115, those sold being held in\r\n  small parcels by Indians. The average death-rate for the period\r\n  1873-1901 was 32.6 per 1000. The average birth-rate in the Indian\r\n  community is 37 per 1000; in the non-Indian community 34 per 1000.\r\n  Many Mauritian Creoles have emigrated to South Africa. The great\r\n  increase in the population since 1851 has made Mauritius one of the\r\n  most densely peopled regions of the world, having over 520 persons per\r\n  square mile.\r\n\r\n  _Chief Towns._--The capital and seat of government, the city of Port\r\n  Louis, is on the north-western side of the island, in 20° 10´ S., 57°\r\n  30´ E. at the head of an excellent harbour, a deep inlet about a mile\r\n  long, available for ships of the deepest draught. This is protected by\r\n  Fort William and Fort George, as well as by the citadel (Fort\r\n  Adelaide), and it has three graving-docks connected with the inner\r\n  harbour, the depths alongside quays and berths being from 12 to 28 ft.\r\n  The trade of the island passes almost entirely through the port.\r\n  Government House is a three-storeyed structure with broad verandas,\r\n  of no particular style of architecture, while the Protestant cathedral\r\n  was formerly a powder magazine, to which a tower and spire have been\r\n  added. The Roman Catholic cathedral is more pretentious in style, but\r\n  is tawdry in its interior. There are, besides the town-hall, Royal\r\n  College, public offices and theatre, large barracks and military\r\n  stores. Port Louis, which is governed by an elective municipal\r\n  council, is surrounded by lofty hills and its unhealthy situation is\r\n  aggravated by the difficulty of effective drainage owing to the small\r\n  amount of tide in the harbour. Though much has been done to make the\r\n  town sanitary, including the provision of a good water-supply, the\r\n  death-rate is generally over 44 per 1000. Consequently all those who\r\n  can make their homes in the cooler uplands of the interior. As a\r\n  result the population of the city decreased from about 70,000 in 1891\r\n  to 53,000 in 1901. The favourite residential town is Curepipe, where\r\n  the climate resembles that of the south of France. It is built on the\r\n  central plateau about 20 m. distant from Port Louis by rail and 1800\r\n  ft. above the sea. Curepipe was incorporated in 1888 and had a\r\n  population (1901) of 13,000. On the railway between Port Louis and\r\n  Curepipe are other residential towns--Beau Bassin, Rose Hill and\r\n  Quatre Bornes. Mahébourg, pop. (1901), 4810, is a town on the shores\r\n  of Grand Port on the south-east side of the island, Souillac a small\r\n  town on the south coast.\r\n\r\n  _Industries.--The Sugar Plantations:_ The soil of the island is of\r\n  considerable fertility; it is a ferruginous red clay, but so largely\r\n  mingled with stones of all sizes that no plough can be used, and the\r\n  hoe has to be employed to prepare the ground for cultivation. The\r\n  greater portion of the plains is now a vast sugar plantation. The\r\n  bright green of the sugar fields is a striking feature in a view of\r\n  Mauritius from the sea, and gives a peculiar beauty and freshness to\r\n  the prospect. The soil is suitable for the cultivation of almost all\r\n  kinds of tropical produce, and it is to be regretted that the\r\n  prosperity of the colony depends almost entirely on one article of\r\n  production, for the consequences are serious when there is a failure,\r\n  more or less, of the sugar crop. Guano is extensively imported as a\r\n  manure, and by its use the natural fertility of the soil has been\r\n  increased to a wonderful extent. Since the beginning of the 20th\r\n  century some attention has been paid to the cultivation of tea and\r\n  cotton, with encouraging results. Of the exports, sugar amounts on an\r\n  average to about 95% of the total. The quantity of sugar exported rose\r\n  from 102,000 tons in 1854 to 189,164 tons in 1877. The competition of\r\n  beet-sugar and the effect of bounties granted by various countries\r\n  then began to tell on the production in Mauritius, the average crop\r\n  for the seven years ending 1900-1901 being only 150,449 tons. The\r\n  Brussels Sugar Convention of 1902 led to an increase in production,\r\n  the average annual weight of sugar exported for the three years\r\n  1904-1906 being 182,000 tons. The value of the crop was likewise\r\n  seriously affected by the causes mentioned, and by various diseases\r\n  which attacked the canes. Thus in 1878 the value of the sugar exported\r\n  was £3,408,000; in 1888 it had sunk to £1,911,000, and in 1898 to\r\n  £1,632,000. In 1900 the value was £1,922,000, and in 1905 it had risen\r\n  to £2,172,000. India and the South African colonies between them take\r\n  some two-thirds of the total produce. The remainder is taken chiefly\r\n  by Great Britain, Canada and Hong-Kong. Next to sugar, aloe-fibre is\r\n  the most important export, the average annual export for the five\r\n  years ending 1906 being 1840 tons. In addition, a considerable\r\n  quantity of molasses and smaller quantities of rum, vanilla and\r\n  coco-nut oil are exported. The imports are mainly rice, wheat, cotton\r\n  goods, wine, coal, hardware and haberdashery, and guano. The rice\r\n  comes principally from India and Madagascar; cattle are imported from\r\n  Madagascar, sheep from South Africa and Australia, and frozen meat\r\n  from Australia. The average annual value of the exports for the ten\r\n  years 1896-1905 was £2,153,159; the average annual value of the\r\n  imports for the same period £1,453,089. These figures when compared\r\n  with those in years before the beet and bounty-fed sugar had entered\r\n  into severe competition with cane sugar, show how greatly the island\r\n  had thereby suffered. In 1864 the exports were valued at £2,249,000;\r\n  in 1868 at £2,339,000; in 1877 at £4,201,000 and in 1880 at\r\n  £3,634,000. And in each of the years named the imports exceeded\r\n  £2,000,000 in value. Nearly all the aloe-fibre exported is taken by\r\n  Great Britain, and France, while the molasses goes to India. Among the\r\n  minor exports is that of _bambara_ or sea-slugs, which are sent to\r\n  Hong-Kong and Singapore. This industry is chiefly in Chinese hands.\r\n  The great majority of the imports are from Great Britain or British\r\n  possessions.\r\n\r\n  The currency of Mauritius is rupees and cents of a rupee, the Indian\r\n  rupee (= 16d.) being the standard unit. The metric system of weights\r\n  and measures has been in force since 1878.\r\n\r\n  _Communications._--There is a regular fortnightly steamship service\r\n  between Marseilles and Port Louis by the Messageries Maritimes, a\r\n  four-weekly service with Southampton via Cape Town by the Union\r\n  Castle, and a four-weekly service with Colombo direct by the British\r\n  India Co.'s boats. There is also frequent communication with\r\n  Madagascar, Réunion and Natal. The average annual tonnage of ships\r\n  entering Port Louis is about 750,000 of which five-sevenths is\r\n  British. Cable communication with Europe, via the Seychelles, Zanzibar\r\n  and Aden, was established in 1893, and the Mauritius section of the\r\n  Cape-Australian cable, via Rodriguez, was completed in 1902.\r\n\r\n  Railways connect all the principal places and sugar estates on the\r\n  island, that known as the Midland line, 36 miles long, beginning at\r\n  Port Louis crosses the island to Mahébourg, passing through Curepipe,\r\n  where it is 1822 ft. above the sea. There are in all over 120 miles of\r\n  railway, all owned and worked by the government. The first railway was\r\n  opened in 1864. The roads are well kept and there is an extensive\r\n  system of tramways for bringing produce from the sugar estates to the\r\n  railway lines. Traction engines are also largely used. There is a\r\n  complete telegraphic and telephonic service.\r\n\r\n_Government and Revenue._--Mauritius is a crown colony. The governor is\r\nassisted by an executive council of five official and two elected\r\nmembers, and a legislative council of 27 members, 8 sitting _ex\r\nofficio_, 9 being nominated by the governor and 10 elected on a moderate\r\nfranchise. Two of the elected members represent St Louis, the 8 rural\r\ndistricts into which the island is divided electing each one member. At\r\nleast one-third of the nominated members must be persons not holding any\r\npublic office. The number of registered electors in 1908 was 6186. The\r\nlegislative session usually lasts from April to December. Members may\r\nspeak either in French or English. The average annual revenue of the\r\ncolony for the ten years 1896-1905, was £608,245, the average annual\r\nexpenditure during the same period £663,606. Up to 1854 there was a\r\nsurplus in hand, but since that time expenditure has on many occasions\r\nexceeded income, and the public debt in 1908 was £1,305,000, mainly\r\nincurred however on reproductive works.\r\n\r\nThe island has largely retained the old French laws, the _codes civil_,\r\n_de procédure_, _du commerce_, and _d'instruction criminelle_ being\r\nstill in force, except so far as altered by colonial ordinances. A\r\nsupreme court of civil and criminal justice was established in 1831\r\nunder a chief judge and three puisne judges.\r\n\r\n  _Religion and Education._--The majority of the European inhabitants\r\n  belong to the Roman Catholic faith. They numbered at the 1901 census\r\n  117,102, and the Protestants 6644. Anglicans, Roman Catholics and the\r\n  Church of Scotland are helped by state grants. At the head of the\r\n  Anglican community is the bishop of Mauritius; the chief Romanist\r\n  dignitary is styled bishop of Port Louis. The Mahommedans number over\r\n  30,000, but the majority of the Indian coolies are Hindus.\r\n\r\n  The educational system, as brought into force in 1900, is under a\r\n  director of public instruction assisted by an advisory committee, and\r\n  consists of two branches (1) superior or secondary instruction, (2)\r\n  primary instruction. For primary instruction there are government\r\n  schools and schools maintained by the Roman Catholics, Protestants and\r\n  other faiths, to which the government gives grants in aid. In 1908\r\n  there were 67 government schools with 8400 scholars and 90 grant\r\n  schools with 10,200 scholars, besides Hindu schools receiving no\r\n  grant. The Roman Catholic scholars number 67.72%; the Protestants\r\n  3.80%; Mahommedans 8.37%; and Hindus and others 20.11%. Secondary and\r\n  higher education is given in the Royal College and associated schools\r\n  at Port Louis and Curepipe.\r\n\r\n  _Defence._--Mauritius occupies an important strategic position on the\r\n  route between South Africa and India and in relation to Madagascar and\r\n  East Africa, while in Port Louis it possesses one of the finest\r\n  harbours in the Indian Ocean. A permanent garrison of some 3000 men is\r\n  maintained in the island at a cost of about £180,000 per annum. To the\r\n  cost of the troops Mauritius contributes 5½% of its annual\r\n  revenue--about £30,000.\r\n\r\n_History._--Mauritius appears to have been unknown to European nations,\r\nif not to all other peoples, until the year 1505, when it was discovered\r\nby Mascarenhas, a Portuguese navigator. It had then no inhabitants, and\r\nthere seem to be no traces of a previous occupation by any people. The\r\nisland was retained for most of the 16th century by its discoverers, but\r\nthey made no settlements in it. In 1598 the Dutch took possession, and\r\nnamed the island \"Mauritius,\" in honour of their stadtholder, Count\r\nMaurice of Nassau. It had been previously called by the Portuguese \"Ilha\r\ndo Cerné,\" from the belief that it was the island so named by Pliny. But\r\nthough the Dutch built a fort at Grand Port and introduced a number of\r\nslaves and convicts, they made no permanent settlement in Mauritius,\r\nfinally abandoning the island in 1710. From 1715 to 1767 (when the\r\nFrench government assumed direct control) the island was held by agents\r\nof the French East India Company, by whom its name was again changed to\r\n\"Île de France.\" The Company was fortunate in having several able men as\r\ngovernors of its colony, especially the celebrated Mahé de Labourdonnais\r\n(q.v.), who made sugar planting the main industry of the\r\ninhabitants.[3] Under his direction roads were made, forts built, and\r\nconsiderable portions of the forest were cleared, and the present\r\ncapital, Port Louis, was founded. Labourdonnais also promoted the\r\nplanting of cotton and indigo, and is remembered as the most enlightened\r\nand best of all the French governors. He also put down the maroons or\r\nrunaway slaves who had long been the pest of the island. The colony\r\ncontinued to rise in value during the time it was held by the French\r\ncrown, and to one of the intendants,[4] Pierre Poivre, was due the\r\nintroduction of the clove, nutmeg and other spices. Another governor was\r\nD'Entrecasteaux, whose name is kept in remembrance by a group of islands\r\neast of New Guinea.\r\n\r\nDuring the long war between France and England, at the commencement of\r\nthe 19th century, Mauritius was a continual source of much mischief to\r\nEnglish Indiamen and other merchant vessels; and at length the British\r\ngovernment determined upon an expedition for its capture. This was\r\neffected in 1810; and upon the restoration of peace in 1814 the\r\npossession of the island was confirmed to Britain by the Treaty of\r\nParis. By the eighth article of capitulation it was agreed that the\r\ninhabitants should retain their own laws, customs, and religion; and\r\nthus the island is still largely French in language, habits, and\r\npredilections; but its name has again been changed to that given by the\r\nDutch. One of the most distinguished of the British governors was Sir\r\nRobert Farquhar (1810-1823), who did much to abolish the Malagasy slave\r\ntrade and to establish friendly relations with the rising power of the\r\nHova sovereign of Madagascar. Later governors of note were Sir Henry\r\nBarkly (1863-1871), and Sir J. Pope Hennessy (1883-1886 and 1888).\r\n\r\nThe history of the colony since its acquisition by Great Britain has\r\nbeen one of social and political evolution. At first all power was\r\nconcentrated in the hands of the governor, but in 1832 a legislative\r\ncouncil was constituted on which non-official nominated members served.\r\nIn 1884-1885 this council was transformed into a partly elected body. Of\r\nmore importance than the constitutional changes were the economic\r\nresults which followed the freeing of the slaves (1834-1839)--for the\r\nloss of whose labour the planters received over £2,000,000 compensation.\r\nCoolies were introduced to supply the place of the negroes, immigration\r\nbeing definitely sanctioned by the government of India in 1842. Though\r\nunder government control the system of coolie labour led to many abuses.\r\nA royal commission investigated the matter in 1871 and since that time\r\nthe evils which were attendant on the system have been gradually\r\nremedied. One result of the introduction of free labour has been to\r\nreduce the descendants of the slave population to a small and\r\nunimportant class--Mauritius in this respect offering a striking\r\ncontrast to the British colonies in the West Indies. The last half of\r\nthe 19th century was, however, chiefly notable in Mauritius for the\r\nnumber of calamities which overtook the island. In 1854 cholera caused\r\nthe death of 17,000 persons; in 1867 over 30,000 people died of malarial\r\nfever; in 1892 a hurricane of terrific violence caused immense\r\ndestruction of property and serious loss of life; in 1893 a great part\r\nof Port Louis was destroyed by fire. There were in addition several\r\nepidemics of small-pox and plague, and from about 1880 onward the\r\ncontinual decline in the price of sugar seriously affected the\r\nislanders, especially the Creole population. During 1902-1905 an\r\noutbreak of surra, which caused great mortality among draught animals,\r\nfurther tried the sugar planters and necessitated government help.\r\nNotwithstanding all these calamities the Mauritians, especially the\r\nIndo-Mauritians, have succeeded in maintaining the position of the\r\ncolony as an important sugar-producing country.\r\n\r\n  _Dependencies._--Dependent upon Mauritius and forming part of the\r\n  colony are a number of small islands scattered over a large extent of\r\n  the Indian Ocean. Of these the chief is Rodriguez (q.v.), 375 m. east\r\n  of Mauritius. Considerably north-east of Rodriguez lie the Oil Islands\r\n  or Chagos archipelago, of which the chief is Diego Garcia (see\r\n  CHAGOS). The Cargados, Carayos or St Brandon islets, deeps and shoals,\r\n  lie at the south end of the Nazareth Bank about 250 m. N.N.E. of\r\n  Mauritius. Until 1903 the Seychelles, Amirantes, Aldabra and other\r\n  islands lying north of Madagascar were also part of the colony of\r\n  Mauritius. In the year named they were formed into a separate colony\r\n  (see SEYCHELLES). Two islands, Farquhar and Coetivy, though\r\n  geographically within the Seychelles area, remained dependent on\r\n  Mauritius, being owned by residents in that island. In 1908, however,\r\n  Coetivy was transferred to the Seychelles administration. Amsterdam\r\n  and St Paul, uninhabited islands in the South Indian Ocean, included\r\n  in an official list of the dependencies of Mauritius drawn up in 1880,\r\n  were in 1893 annexed by France. The total population of the\r\n  dependencies of Mauritius was estimated in 1905 at 5400.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--F.

The real foundation of his fortunes was the success of a\r\npanegyric on St Louis delivered before the Academy in 1772, which caused\r\nhim to be recommended for an abbacy. In 1777 he published under the\r\ntitle of _Discours choisis_ his panegyrics on Saint Louis, Saint\r\nAugustine and Fénelon, his remarks on Bossuet and his _Essai sur\r\nl'éloquence de la chaire_, a volume which contains much good criticism,\r\nand remains a French classic. The book was often reprinted as _Principes\r\nde l'éloquence_. He became a favourite preacher in Paris, and was Lent\r\npreacher at court in 1781, when King Louis XVI. said of his sermon: \"If\r\nthe abbé had only said a few words on religion he would have discussed\r\nevery possible subject.\" In 1781 he obtained the rich priory of Lyons,\r\nnear Péronne, and in 1785 he was elected to the Academy, as successor of\r\nLefranc de Pompignan. His morals were as loose as those of his great\r\nrival Mirabeau, but he was famed in Paris for his wit and gaiety. In\r\n1789 he was elected a member of the states-general by the clergy of the\r\nbailliage of Péronne, and from the first proved to be the most able and\r\npersevering defender of the _ancien régime_, although he had drawn up\r\nthe greater part of the _cahier_ of the clergy of Péronne, which\r\ncontained a considerable programme of reform. It is said that he\r\nattempted to emigrate both in July and in October 1789; but after that\r\ntime he held firmly to his place, when almost universally deserted by\r\nhis friends. In the Constituent Assembly he took an active part in every\r\nimportant debate, combating with especial vigour the alienation of the\r\nproperty of the clergy. His life was often in danger, but his ready wit\r\nalways saved it, and it was said that one _bon mot_ would preserve him\r\nfor a month. When he did emigrate in 1792 he found himself regarded as\r\na martyr to the church and the king, and was at once named archbishop\r\n_in partibus_, and extra nuncio to the diet at Frankfort, and in 1794\r\ncardinal. He was finally made bishop of Montefiascone, and settled down\r\nin that little Italian town--but not for long, for in 1798 the French\r\ndrove him from his retreat, and he sought refuge in Venice and St\r\nPetersburg. Next year he returned to Rome as ambassador of the exiled\r\nLouis XVIII. at the papal court. In 1804 he began to prepare his return\r\nto France by a well-turned letter to Napoleon, congratulating him on\r\nrestoring religion to France once more. In 1806 he did return; in 1807\r\nhe was again received into the Academy; and in 1810, on the refusal of\r\nCardinal Fesch, was made archbishop of Paris. He was presently ordered\r\nby the pope to surrender his functions as archbishop of Paris. This he\r\nrefused to do. On the restoration of the Bourbons he was summarily\r\nexpelled from the Academy and from the archiepiscopal palace. He retired\r\nto Rome, where he was imprisoned in the castle of St Angelo for six\r\nmonths for his disobedience to the papal orders, and died in 1817, a\r\nyear or two after his release, of disease contracted in prison and of\r\nchagrin. As a critic he was a very able writer, and Sainte-Beuve gives\r\nhim the credit of discovering Father Jacques Bridayne, and of giving\r\nBossuet his rightful place as a preacher above Massillon; as a\r\npolitician, his wit and eloquence make him a worthy rival of Mirabeau.\r\nHe sacrificed too much to personal ambition, yet it would have been a\r\ngraceful act if Louis XVIII. had remembered the courageous supporter of\r\nLouis XVI., and the pope the one intrepid defender of the Church in the\r\nstates-general.\r\n\r\n  The _Oeuvres choisies du Cardinal Maury_ (5 vols., 1827) contain what\r\n  is worth preserving. Mgr Ricard has published Maury's _Correspondance\r\n  diplomatique_ (2 vols., Lille, 1891). For his life and character see\r\n  _Vie du Cardinal Maury_, by Louis Siffrein Maury, his nephew (1828);\r\n  J. J. F. Poujoulat, _Cardinal Maury, sa vie et ses oeuvres_ (1855);\r\n  Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du lundi_ (vol. iv.); Mgr Ricard, _L'Abbé\r\n  Maury_ (1746-1791), _L'Abbé Maury avant 1789, L'Abbé Maury et\r\n  Mirabeau_ (1887); G.

Of the many libels written\r\n  against him during the Revolution the most noteworthy are the _Petit\r\n  carême de l'abbé Maury_, with a supplement called the _Seconde année_\r\n  (1790), and the _Vie privée de l'abbé Maury_ (1790), claimed by J. R.\r\n  Hébert, but attributed by some writers to Restif de la Bretonne. For\r\n  further bibliographical details see J. M. Quérard, _La France\r\n  littéraire_, vol. v. (1833).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURY, LOUIS FERDINAND ALFRED (1817-1892), French scholar, was born at\r\nMeaux on the 23rd of March 1817. In 1836, having completed his\r\neducation, he entered the Bibliothèque Nationale, and afterwards the\r\nBibliothèque de l'Institut (1844), where he devoted himself to the study\r\nof archaeology, ancient and modern languages, medicine and law. Gifted\r\nwith a great capacity for work, a remarkable memory and an unbiassed and\r\ncritical mind, he produced without great effort a number of learned\r\npamphlets and books on the most varied subjects. He rendered great\r\nservice to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, of which he\r\nhad been elected a member in 1857. Napoleon III. employed him in\r\nresearch work connected with the _Histoire de César_, and he was\r\nrewarded, proportionately to his active, if modest, part in this work,\r\nwith the positions of librarian of the Tuileries (1860), professor at\r\nthe College of France (1862) and director-general of the Archives\r\n(1868). It was not, however, to the imperial favour that he owed these\r\nhigh positions. He used his influence for the advancement of science and\r\nhigher education, and with Victor Duruy was one of the founders of the\r\nÉcole des Hautes Études. He died at Paris four years after his\r\nretirement from the last post, on the 11th of February 1892.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--His works are numerous: _Les Fées au moyen âge_ and\r\n  _Histoire des légendes pieuses au moyen âge_; two books filled with\r\n  ingenious ideas, which were published in 1843, and reprinted after the\r\n  death of the author, with numerous additions under the title\r\n  _Croyances et légendes du moyen âge_ (1896); _Histoire des grandes\r\n  forêts de la Gaule et de l'ancienne France_ (1850, a 3rd ed. revised\r\n  appeared in 1867 under the title _Les Forêts de la Gaule et de\r\n  l'ancienne France); La Terre et l'homme_, a general historical sketch\r\n  of geology, geography and ethnology, being the introduction to the\r\n  _Histoire universelle_, by Victor Duruy (1854); _Histoire des\r\n  religions de la_ _Grèce antique_, (3 vols., 1857-1859); _La Magie et\r\n  l'astrologie dans l'antiquité et dans le moyen âge_ (1863); _Histoire\r\n  de l'ancienne académie des sciences_ (1864); _Histoire de l'Académie\r\n  des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres_ (1865); a learned paper on the\r\n  reports of French archaeology, written on the occasion of the\r\n  universal exhibition (1867); a number of articles in the _Encyclopédie\r\n  moderne_ (1846-1851), in Michaud's _Biographie universelle_ (1858 and\r\n  seq.), in the _Journal des savants_ in the _Revue des deux mondes_\r\n  (1873, 1877, 1879-1880, &c.). A detailed bibliography of his works has\r\n  been placed by Auguste Longnon at the beginning of the volume _Les\r\n  Croyances et légendes du moyen âge_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURY, MATTHEW FONTAINE (1806-1873), American naval officer and\r\nhydrographer, was born near Fredericksburg in Spottsylvania county,\r\nVirginia, on the 24th of January 1806. He was educated at Harpeth\r\nacademy, and in 1825 entered the navy as midshipman, circumnavigating\r\nthe globe in the \"Vincennes,\" during a cruise of four years (1826-1830).\r\nIn 1831 he was appointed master of the sloop \"Falmouth\" on the Pacific\r\nstation, and subsequently served in other vessels before returning home\r\nin 1834, when he married his cousin, Ann Herndon. In 1835-1836 he was\r\nactively engaged in producing for publication a treatise on navigation,\r\na remarkable achievement at so early a stage in his career; he was at\r\nthis time made lieutenant, and gazetted astronomer to a South Sea\r\nexploring expedition, but resigned this position and was appointed to\r\nthe survey of southern harbours. In 1839 he met with an accident which\r\nresulted in permanent lameness, and unfitted him for active service. In\r\nthe same year, however, he began to write a series of articles on naval\r\nreform and other subjects, under the title of _Scraps from the\r\nLucky-Bag_, which attracted much attention; and in 1841 he was placed in\r\ncharge of the Dépôt of Charts and Instruments, out of which grew the\r\nUnited States Naval Observatory and the Hydrographie Office. He laboured\r\nassiduously to obtain observations as to the winds and currents by\r\ndistributing to captains of vessels specially prepared log-books; and in\r\nthe course of nine years he had collected a sufficient number of logs to\r\nmake two hundred manuscript volumes, each with about two thousand five\r\nhundred days' observations. One result was to show the necessity for\r\ncombined action on the part of maritime nations in regard to ocean\r\nmeteorology. This led to an international conference at Brussels in\r\n1853, which produced the greatest benefit to navigation as well as\r\nindirectly to meteorology. Maury attempted to organize co-operative\r\nmeteorological work on land, but the government did not at this time\r\ntake any steps in this direction. His oceanographical work, however,\r\nreceived recognition in all parts of the civilized world, and in 1855 it\r\nwas proposed in the senate to remunerate him, but in the same year the\r\nNaval Retiring Board, erected under an act to promote the efficiency of\r\nthe navy, placed him on the retired list. This action aroused wide\r\nopposition, and in 1858 he was reinstated with the rank of commander as\r\nfrom 1855. In 1853 Maury had published his _Letters on the Amazon and\r\nAtlantic Slopes of South America_, and the most widely popular of his\r\nworks, the _Physical Geography of the Sea_, was published in London in\r\n1855, and in New York in 1856; it was translated into several European\r\nlanguages. On the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Maury\r\nthrew in his lot with the South, and became head of coast, harbour and\r\nriver defences. He invented an electric torpedo for harbour defence, and\r\nin 1862 was ordered to England to purchase torpedo material, &c. Here he\r\ntook active part in organizing a petition for peace to the American\r\npeople, which was unsuccessful. Afterwards he became imperial\r\ncommissioner of emigration to the emperor Maximilian of Mexico, and\r\nattempted to form a Virginian colony in that country. Incidentally he\r\nintroduced there the cultivation of cinchona. The scheme of colonization\r\nwas abandoned by the emperor (1866), and Maury, who had lost nearly his\r\nall during the war, settled for a while in England, where he was\r\npresented with a testimonial raised by public subscription, and among\r\nother honours received the degree of LL.D. of Cambridge University\r\n(1868). In the same year, a general amnesty admitting of his return to\r\nAmerica, he accepted the professorship of meteorology in the Virginia\r\nMilitary Institute, and settled at Lexington, Virginia, where he died on\r\nthe 1st of February 1873.\r\n\r\n  Among works published by Maury, in addition to those mentioned, are\r\n  the papers contributed by him to the _Astronomical Observations_ of\r\n  the United States Observatory, _Letter concerning Lanes for Steamers\r\n  crossing the Atlantic_ (1855); _Physical Geography_ (1864) and _Manual\r\n  of Geography_ (1871). In 1859 he began the publication of a series of\r\n  _Nautical Monographs_.\r\n\r\n  See Diana Fontaine Maury Corbin (his daughter), _Life of Matthew\r\n  Fontaine Maury_ (London, 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUSOLEUM, the term given to a monument erected to receive the remains\r\nof a deceased person, which may sometimes take the form of a sepulchral\r\nchapel. The term _cenotaph_ ([Greek: kenos], empty, [Greek: taphos],\r\ntomb) is employed for a similar monument where the body is not buried in\r\nthe structure. The term \"mausoleum\" originated with the magnificent\r\nmonument erected by Queen Artemisia in 353 B.C. in memory of her husband\r\nKing Mausolus, of which the remains were brought to England in 1859 by\r\nSir Charles Newton and placed in the British Museum. The tombs of\r\nAugustus and of Hadrian in Rome are perhaps the largest monuments of the\r\nkind ever erected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUSOLUS (more correctly MAUSSOLLUS), satrap and practically ruler of\r\nCaria (377-353 B.C.). The part he took in the revolt against Artaxerxes\r\nMnemon, his conquest of a great part of Lycia, Ionia and of several of\r\nthe Greek islands, his co-operation with the Rhodians and their allies\r\nin the war against Athens, and the removal of his capital from Mylasa,\r\nthe ancient seat of the Carian kings, to Halicarnassus are the leading\r\nfacts of his history. He is best known from the tomb erected for him by\r\nhis widow Artemisia. The architects Satyrus and Pythis, and the\r\nsculptors Scopas, Leochares, Bryaxis and Timotheus, finished the work\r\nafter her death. (See HALICARNASSUS.) An inscription discovered at\r\nMylasa (Böckh, _Inscr. gr._ ii. 2691 _c._) details the punishment of\r\ncertain conspirators who had made an attempt upon his life at a festival\r\nin a temple at Labranda in 353.\r\n\r\n  See Diod. Sic. xv. 90, 3, xvi. 7, 4, 36, 2; Demosthenes, _De Rhodiorum\r\n  libertate_; J. B. Bury, _Hist. of Greece_ (1902), ii. 271; W. Judeich,\r\n  _Kleinasiatische Studien_ (Marburg, 1892), pp. 226-256, and\r\n  authorities under HALICARNASSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAUVE, ANTON (1838-1888), Dutch landscape painter, was born at Zaandam,\r\nthe son of a Baptist minister. Much against the wish of his parents he\r\ntook up the study of art and entered the studio of Van Os, whose dry\r\nacademic manner had, however, but little attraction for him. He\r\nbenefited far more by his intimacy with his friends Jozef Israels and W.\r\nMaris. Encouraged by their example he abandoned his early tight and\r\nhighly finished manner for a freer, looser method of painting, and the\r\nbrilliant palette of his youthful work for a tender lyric harmony which\r\nis generally restricted to delicate greys, greens, and light blue. He\r\nexcelled in rendering the soft hazy atmosphere that lingers over the\r\ngreen meadows of Holland, and devoted himself almost exclusively to\r\ndepicting the peaceful rural life of the fields and country lanes of\r\nHolland--especially of the districts near Oosterbeck and Wolfhezen, the\r\nsand dunes of the coast at Scheveningen, and the country near Laren,\r\nwhere he spent the last years of his life. A little sad and melancholy,\r\nhis pastoral scenes are nevertheless conceived in a peaceful soothing\r\nlyrical mood, which is in marked contrast to the epic power and almost\r\ntragic intensity of J. F. Millet. There are fourteen of Mauve's pictures\r\nat the Mesdag Museum at the Hague, and two (\"Milking Time\" and \"A\r\nFishing Boat putting to Sea\") at the Ryks Museum in Amsterdam. The\r\nGlasgow Corporation Gallery owns his painting of \"A Flock of Sheep.\" The\r\nfinest and most representative private collection of pictures by Mauve\r\nwas made by Mr J. C. J. Drucker, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAVROCORDATO, MAVROCORDAT or MAVROGORDATO, the name of a family of\r\nPhanariot Greeks, distinguished in the history of Turkey, Rumania and\r\nmodern Greece. The family was founded by a merchant of Chios, whose son\r\nAlexander Mavrocordato (c. 1636-1709), a doctor of philosophy and\r\nmedicine of Bologna, became dragoman to the sultan in 1673, and was much\r\nemployed in negotiations with Austria. It was he who drew up the treaty\r\nof Karlowitz (1699). He became a secretary of state, and was created a\r\ncount of the Holy Roman Empire. His authority, with that of Hussein\r\nKupruli and Rami Pasha, was supreme at the court of Mustapha II., and he\r\ndid much to ameliorate the condition of the Christians in Turkey. He\r\nwas disgraced in 1703, but was recalled to court by Sultan Ahmed III. He\r\nleft some historical, grammatical, &c. treatises of little value.\r\n\r\nHis son NICHOLAS MAVROCORDATO (1670-1730) was grand dragoman to the\r\nDivan (1697), and in 1708 was appointed hospodar (prince) of Moldavia.\r\nDeposed, owing to the sultan's suspicions, in favour of Demetrius\r\nCantacuzene, he was restored in 1711, and soon afterwards became\r\nhospodar of Walachia. In 1716 he was deposed by the Austrians, but was\r\nrestored after the peace of Passarowitz. He was the first Greek set to\r\nrule the Danubian principalities, and was responsible for establishing\r\nthe system which for a hundred years was to make the name of Greek\r\nhateful to the Rumanians. He introduced Greek manners, the Greek\r\nlanguage and Greek costume, and set up a splendid court on the Byzantine\r\nmodel. For the rest he was a man of enlightenment, founded libraries and\r\nwas himself the author of a curious work entitled [Greek: Peri\r\nkathêkontôn] (Bucharest, 1719). He was succeeded as grand dragoman\r\n(1709) by his son John (Ioannes), who was for a short while hospodar of\r\nMoldavia, and died in 1720.\r\n\r\nNicholas Mavrocordato was succeeded as prince of Walachia in 1730 by his\r\nson Constantine. He was deprived in the same year, but again ruled the\r\nprincipality from 1735 to 1741 and from 1744 to 1748; he was prince of\r\nMoldavia from 1741 to 1744 and from 1748 to 1749. His rule was\r\ndistinguished by numerous tentative reforms in the fiscal and\r\nadministrative systems. He was wounded and taken prisoner in the affair\r\nof Galati during the Russo-Turkish War, on the 5th of November 1769, and\r\ndied in captivity.\r\n\r\nPRINCE ALEXANDER MAVROCORDATO (1791-1865), Greek statesman, a descendant\r\nof the hospodars, was born at Constantinople on the 11th of February\r\n1791. In 1812 he went to the court of his uncle Ioannes Caradja,\r\nhospodar of Walachia, with whom he passed into exile in Russia and Italy\r\n(1817). He was a member of the Hetairia Philike and was among the\r\nPhanariot Greeks who hastened to the Morea on the outbreak of the War of\r\nIndependence in 1821. He was active in endeavouring to establish a\r\nregular government, and in January 1822 presided over the first Greek\r\nnational assembly at Epidaurus. He commanded the advance of the Greeks\r\ninto western Hellas the same year, and suffered a defeat at Peta on the\r\n16th of July, but retrieved this disaster somewhat by his successful\r\nresistance to the first siege of Missolonghi (Nov. 1822 to Jan. 1823).\r\nHis English sympathies brought him, in the subsequent strife of\r\nfactions, into opposition to the \"Russian\" party headed by Demetrius\r\nYpsilanti and Kolokotrones; and though he held the portfolio of foreign\r\naffairs for a short while under the presidency of Petrobey (Petros\r\nMavromichales), he was compelled to withdraw from affairs until February\r\n1825, when he again became a secretary of state. The landing of Ibrahim\r\nPasha followed, and Mavrocordato again joined the army, only escaping\r\ncapture in the disaster at Sphagia (Spakteria), on the 9th of May 1815,\r\nby swimming to Navarino. After the fall of Missolonghi (April 22, 1826)\r\nhe went into retirement, until President Capo d'Istria made him a member\r\nof the committee for the administration of war material, a position he\r\nresigned in 1828. After Capo d'Istria's murder (Oct. 9, 1831) and the\r\nresignation of his brother and successor, Agostino Capo d'Istria (April\r\n13, 1832), Mavrocordato became minister of finance. He was\r\nvice-president of the National Assembly at Argos (July, 1832), and was\r\nappointed by King Otto minister of finance, and in 1833 premier. From\r\n1834 onwards he was Greek envoy at Munich, Berlin, London and--after a\r\nshort interlude as premier in Greece in 1841--Constantinople. In 1843,\r\nafter the revolution of September, he returned to Athens as minister\r\nwithout portfolio in the Metaxas cabinet, and from April to August 1844\r\nwas head of the government formed after the fall of the \"Russian\" party.\r\nGoing into opposition, he distinguished himself by his violent attacks\r\non the Kolettis government. In 1854-1855 he was again head of the\r\ngovernment for a few months. He died in Aegina on the 18th of August\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n  See E. Legrand, _Genealogie des Mavrocordato_ (Paris, 1886).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAWKMAI (Burmese _Maukmè_), one of the largest states in the eastern\r\ndivision of the southern Shan States of Burma. It lies approximately\r\nbetween 19° 30´ and 20° 30´ N. and 97° 30´ and 98° 15´ E., and has an\r\narea of 2,787 sq. m. The central portion of the state consists of a wide\r\nplain well watered and under rice cultivation. The rest is chiefly hills\r\nin ranges running north and south. There is a good deal of teak in the\r\nstate, but it has been ruinously worked. The sawbwa now works as\r\ncontractor for government, which takes one-third of the net profits.\r\nRice is the chief crop, but much tobacco of good quality is grown in the\r\nLangkö district on the Têng river. There is also a great deal of\r\ncattle-breeding. The population in 1901 was 29,454, over two-thirds of\r\nwhom were Shans and the remainder Taungthu, Burmese, Yangsek and Red\r\nKarens. The capital, MAWKMAI, stands in a fine rice plain in 20° 9´ N.\r\nand 97° 25´ E. It had about 150 houses when it first submitted in 1887,\r\nbut was burnt out by the Red Karens in the following year. It has since\r\nrecovered. There are very fine orange groves a few miles south of the\r\ntown at Kantu-awn, called Kadugate by the Burmese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXENTIUS, MARCUS AURELIUS VALERIUS, Roman emperor from A.D. 306 to 312,\r\nwas the son of Maximianus Herculius, and the son-in-law of Galerius.\r\nOwing to his vices and incapacity he was left out of account in the\r\ndivision of the empire which took place in 305. A variety of causes,\r\nhowever, had produced strong dissatisfaction at Rome with many of the\r\narrangements established by Diocletian, and on the 28th of October 306,\r\nthe public discontent found expression in the massacre of those\r\nmagistrates who remained loyal to Flavius Valerius Severus and in the\r\nelection of Maxentius to the imperial dignity. With the help of his\r\nfather, Maxentius was enabled to put Severus to death and to repel the\r\ninvasion of Galerius; his next steps were first to banish Maximianus,\r\nand then, after achieving a military success in Africa against the\r\nrebellious governor, L. Domitius Alexander, to declare war against\r\nConstantine as having brought about the death of his father Maximianus.\r\nHis intention of carrying the war into Gaul was anticipated by\r\nConstantine, who marched into Italy. Maxentius was defeated at Saxa\r\nRubra near Rome and drowned in the Tiber while attempting to make his\r\nway across the Milvian bridge into Rome. He was a man of brutal and\r\nworthless character; but although Gibbon's statement that he was \"just,\r\nhumane and even partial towards the afflicted Christians\" may be\r\nexaggerated, it is probable that he never exhibited any special\r\nhostility towards them.\r\n\r\n  See De Broglie, _L'Église et l'empire Romain au quatrième siècle_\r\n  (1856-1866), and on the attitude of the Romans towards Christianity\r\n  generally, app. 8 in vol. ii. of J. B. Bury's edition of Gibbon\r\n  (Zosimus ii. 9-18; Zonaras xii. 33, xiii. 1; Aurelius Victor, _Epit._\r\n  40; Eutropius, x. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIM, SIR HIRAM STEVENS (1840-   ), Anglo-American engineer and\r\ninventor, was born at Sangerville, Maine, U.S.A., on the 5th of February\r\n1840. After serving an apprenticeship with a coachbuilder, he entered\r\nthe machine works of his uncle, Levi Stevens, at Fitchburg,\r\nMassachusetts, in 1864, and four years later he became a draughtsman in\r\nthe Novelty Iron Works and Shipbuilding Company in New York City. About\r\nthis period he produced several inventions connected with illumination\r\nby gas; and from 1877 he was one of the numerous inventors who were\r\ntrying to solve the problem of making an efficient and durable\r\nincandescent electric lamp, in this connexion introducing the\r\nwidely-used process of treating the carbon filaments by heating them in\r\nan atmosphere of hydrocarbon vapour. In 1880 he came to Europe, and soon\r\nbegan to devote himself to the construction of a machine-gun which\r\nshould be automatically loaded and fired by the energy of the recoil\r\n(see MACHINE-GUN). In order to realize the full usefulness of the\r\nweapon, which was first exhibited in an underground range at Hatton\r\nGarden, London, in 1884, he felt the necessity of employing a smokeless\r\npowder, and accordingly he devised maximite, a mixture of\r\ntrinitrocellulose, nitroglycerine and castor oil, which was patented in\r\n1889. He also undertook to make a flying machine, and after numerous\r\npreliminary experiments constructed an apparatus which was tried at\r\nBexley Heath, Kent, in 1894. (See FLIGHT.) Having been naturalized as a\r\nBritish subject, he was knighted in 1901. His younger brother, Hudson\r\nMaxim (b. 1853), took out numerous patents in connexion with explosives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMA AND MINIMA, in mathematics. By the _maximum_ or _minimum_ value\r\nof an expression or quantity is meant primarily the \"greatest\" or\r\n\"least\" value that it can receive. In general, however, there are points\r\nat which its value ceases to increase and begins to decrease; its value\r\nat such a point is called a maximum. So there are points at which its\r\nvalue ceases to decrease and begins to increase; such a value is called\r\na minimum. There may be several maxima or minima, and a minimum is not\r\nnecessarily less than a maximum. For instance, the expression (x² + x +\r\n2)/(x - 1) can take all values from -[oo] to -1 and from +7 to +[oo],\r\nbut has, so long as x is real, no value between -1 and +7. Here -1 is a\r\nmaximum value, and +7 is a minimum value of the expression, though it\r\ncan be made greater or less than any assignable quantity.\r\n\r\nThe first general method of investigating maxima and minima seems to\r\nhave been published in A.D. 1629 by Pierre Fermat. Particular cases had\r\nbeen discussed. Thus Euclid in book III. of the _Elements_ finds the\r\ngreatest and least straight lines that can be drawn from a point to the\r\ncircumference of a circle, and in book VI. (in a proposition generally\r\nomitted from editions of his works) finds the parallelogram of greatest\r\narea with a given perimeter. Apollonius investigated the greatest and\r\nleast distances of a point from the perimeter of a conic section, and\r\ndiscovered them to be the normals, and that their feet were the\r\nintersections of the conic with a rectangular hyperbola. Some remarkable\r\ntheorems on maximum areas are attributed to Zenodorus, and preserved by\r\nPappus and Theon of Alexandria. The most noteworthy of them are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n  1. Of polygons of n sides with a given perimeter the regular polygon\r\n  encloses the greatest area.\r\n\r\n  2. Of two regular polygons of the same perimeter, that with the\r\n  greater number of sides encloses the greater area.\r\n\r\n  3. The circle encloses a greater area than any polygon of the same\r\n  perimeter.\r\n\r\n  4. The sum of the areas of two isosceles triangles on given bases, the\r\n  sum of whose perimeters is given, is greatest when the triangles are\r\n  similar.\r\n\r\n  5. Of segments of a circle of given perimeter, the semicircle encloses\r\n  the greatest area.\r\n\r\n  6. The sphere is the surface of given area which encloses the greatest\r\n  volume.\r\n\r\nSerenus of Antissa investigated the somewhat trifling problem of finding\r\nthe triangle of greatest area whose sides are formed by the\r\nintersections with the base and curved surface of a right circular cone\r\nof a plane drawn through its vertex.\r\n\r\nThe next problem on maxima and minima of which there appears to be any\r\nrecord occurs in a letter from Regiomontanus to Roder (July 4, 1471),\r\nand is a particular numerical example of the problem of finding the\r\npoint on a given straight line at which two given points subtend a\r\nmaximum angle. N. Tartaglia in his _General trattato de numeri et\r\nmesuri_ (c. 1556) gives, without proof, a rule for dividing a number\r\ninto two parts such that the continued product of the numbers and their\r\ndifference is a maximum.\r\n\r\nFermat investigated maxima and minima by means of the principle that in\r\nthe neighbourhood of a maximum or minimum the differences of the values\r\nof a function are insensible, a method virtually the same as that of the\r\ndifferential calculus, and of great use in dealing with geometrical\r\nmaxima and minima. His method was developed by Huygens, Leibnitz, Newton\r\nand others, and in particular by John Hudde, who investigated maxima and\r\nminima of functions of more than one independent variable, and made some\r\nattempt to discriminate between maxima and minima, a question first\r\ndefinitely settled, so far as one variable is concerned, by Colin\r\nMaclaurin in his _Treatise on Fluxions_ (1742). The method of the\r\ndifferential calculus was perfected by Euler and Lagrange.\r\n\r\nJohn Bernoulli's famous problem of the \"brachistochrone,\" or curve of\r\nquickest descent from one point to another under the action of gravity,\r\nproposed in 1696, gave rise to a new kind of maximum and minimum problem\r\nin which we have to find a curve and not points on a given curve. From\r\nthese problems arose the \"Calculus of Variations.\" (See VARIATIONS,\r\nCALCULUS OF.)\r\n\r\nThe only general methods of attacking problems on maxima and minima are\r\nthose of the differential calculus or, in geometrical problems, what is\r\npractically Fermat's method. Some problems may be solved by algebra;\r\nthus if y = f(x) ÷ [phi](x), where f(x) and [phi](x) are polynomials in\r\nx, the limits to the values of y[phi] may be found from the\r\nconsideration that the equation y[phi](x) - f(x) = 0 must have real\r\nroots. This is a useful method in the case in which [phi](x) and f(x)\r\nare quadratics, but scarcely ever in any other case. The problem of\r\nfinding the maximum product of n positive quantities whose sum is given\r\nmay also be found, algebraically, thus. If a and b are any two real\r\nunequal quantities whatever {½(a + b)}² > ab, so that we can increase\r\nthe product leaving the sum unaltered by replacing any two terms by half\r\ntheir sum, and so long as any two of the quantities are unequal we can\r\nincrease the product. Now, the quantities being all positive, the\r\nproduct cannot be increased without limit and must somewhere attain a\r\nmaximum, and no other form of the product than that in which they are\r\nall equal can be the maximum, so that the product is a maximum when they\r\nare all equal. Its minimum value is obviously zero. If the restriction\r\nthat all the quantities shall be positive is removed, the product can be\r\nmade equal to any quantity, positive or negative. So other theorems of\r\nalgebra, which are stated as theorems on inequalities, may be regarded\r\nas algebraic solutions of problems on maxima and minima.\r\n\r\nFor purely geometrical questions the only general method available is\r\npractically that employed by Fermat. If a quantity depends on the\r\nposition of some point P on a curve, and if its value is equal at two\r\nneighbouring points P and P´, then at some position between P and P´ it\r\nattains a maximum or minimum, and this position may be found by making P\r\nand P´ approach each other indefinitely. Take for instance the problem\r\nof Regiomontanus \"to find a point on a given straight line which\r\nsubtends a maximum angle at two given points A and B.\" Let P and P´ be\r\ntwo near points on the given straight line such that the angles APB and\r\nAP´B are equal. Then ABPP´ lie on a circle. By making P and P´ approach\r\neach other we see that for a maximum or minimum value of the angle APB,\r\nP is a point in which a circle drawn through AB touches the given\r\nstraight line. There are two such points, and unless the given straight\r\nline is at right angles to AB the two angles obtained are not the same.\r\nIt is easily seen that both angles are maxima, one for points on the\r\ngiven straight line on one side of its intersection with AB, the other\r\nfor points on the other side. For further examples of this method\r\ntogether with most other geometrical problems on maxima and minima of\r\nany interest or importance the reader may consult such a book as J. W.\r\nRussell's _A Sequel lo Elementary Geometry_ (Oxford, 1907).\r\n\r\n  The method of the differential calculus is theoretically very simple.\r\n  Let u be a function of several variables x1, x2, x3 ... x_n, supposed\r\n  for the present independent; if u is a maximum or minimum for the set\r\n  of values x1, x2, x3, ... x_n, and u becomes u + [delta]u, when x1,\r\n  x2, x3 ... x_n receive small increments [delta]x1, [delta]x2, ...\r\n  [delta]x_n; then [delta]u must have the same sign for all possible\r\n  values of [delta]x1, [delta]2 ... [delta]x_n.\r\n\r\n  Now\r\n                                            _                                                                   _\r\n                __ [delta]u                |   __ [delta]²u       __      [delta]³u                              |\r\n    [delta]u = \\   --------- [delta]x1 + ½ |  \\   ---------- + 2 \\   ------------------- [delta]x1 [delta]x2 ... | + ...\r\n               /__ [delta]x1               |_ /__ [delta]x1²     /__ [delta]x1 [delta]x2                        _|\r\n\r\n  The sign of this expression in general is that of\r\n  [Sigma]([delta]u/[delta]x1)[delta]x1, which cannot be one-signed when\r\n  x1, x2, ... x_n can take all possible values, for a set of increments\r\n  [delta]x1, [delta]x2 ... [delta]x_n, will give an opposite sign to the\r\n  set -[delta]x1, -[delta]x2, ... -[delta]x_n. Hence\r\n  [Sigma]([delta]u/[delta]x1)[delta]x1 must vanish for all sets of\r\n  increments [delta]x1, ... [delta]x_n, and since these are independent,\r\n  we must have [delta]u/[delta]x1 = 0, [delta]u/[delta]x2 = 0, ...\r\n  [delta]u/[delta]x_n = 0. A value of u given by a set of solutions of\r\n  these equations is called a \"critical value\" of u. The value of\r\n  [delta]u now becomes\r\n       _                                                                               _\r\n      |   __ [delta]²u                 __      [delta]²u                                |\r\n    ½ |  \\   --------- [delta]x1² + 2 \\   ------------------- [delta]x1 [delta]x2 + ... |;\r\n      |_ /__ [delta]x1²               /__ [delta]x1 [delta]x2                          _|\r\n\r\n  for u to be a maximum or minimum this must have always the same sign.\r\n  For the case of a single variable x, corresponding to a value of x\r\n  given by the equation du/dx = 0, u is a maximum or minimum as d²u/dx²\r\n  is negative or positive. If d²u/dx² vanishes, then there is no maximum\r\n  or minimum unless d²u/dx² vanishes, and there is a maximum or minimum\r\n  according as d^4u/dx^4 is negative or positive. Generally, if the\r\n  first differential coefficient which does not vanish is even, there is\r\n  a maximum or minimum according as this is negative or positive. If it\r\n  is odd, there is no maximum or minimum.\r\n\r\n  In the case of several variables, the quadratic\r\n\r\n     __ [delta]²u                  __      [delta]²u\r\n    \\   ---------- [delta]x1² + 2 \\   ------------------- + ...\r\n    /__ [delta]x1²                /__ [delta]x1 [delta]x2\r\n\r\n  must be one-signed. The condition for this is that the series of\r\n  discriminants\r\n\r\n    a11 , | a11  a12 | , | a11  a12  a13 | , ...\r\n          | a21  a22 |   | a21  a22  a23 |\r\n                         | a31  a32  a33 |\r\n\r\n  where a_pq denotes [delta]²u/[delta]a_p[delta]a_q should be all\r\n  positive, if the quadratic is always positive, and alternately\r\n  negative and positive, if the quadratic is always negative. If the\r\n  first condition is satisfied the critical value is a minimum, if the\r\n  second it is a maximum. For the case of two variables the conditions\r\n  are\r\n\r\n     [delta]²u   [delta]²u     /       [delta]²      \\²\r\n    ---------- · ---------- > (  -------------------  )\r\n    [delta]x1²   [delta]x2²    \\ [delta]x1 [delta]x2 /\r\n\r\n  for a maximum or minimum at all and [delta]²u/[delta]x1² and\r\n  [delta]²u/[delta]x2² both negative for a maximum, and both positive\r\n  for a minimum. It is important to notice that by the quadratic being\r\n  one-signed is meant that it cannot be made to vanish except when\r\n  [delta]x1, [delta]x2, ... [delta]x_n all vanish. If, in the case of\r\n  two variables,\r\n\r\n    [delta]²u    [delta]²u     /      [delta]²u      \\²\r\n    ---------- · ---------- = (  -------------------  )\r\n    [delta]x1²   [delta]x2²    \\ [delta]x1 [delta]x2 /\r\n\r\n  then the quadratic is one-signed unless it vanishes, but the value of\r\n  u is not necessarily a maximum or minimum, and the terms of the third\r\n  and possibly fourth order must be taken account of.\r\n\r\n  Take for instance the function u = x² - xy² + y². Here the values x =\r\n  0, y = 0 satisfy the equations [delta]u/[delta]x = 0,\r\n  [delta]u/[delta]y = 0, so that zero is a critical value of u, but it\r\n  is neither a maximum nor a minimum although the terms of the second\r\n  order are ([delta]x)², and are never negative. Here [delta]u =\r\n  [delta]x² - [delta]x[delta]y² + [delta]y², and by putting [delta]x = 0\r\n  or an infinitesimal of the same order as [delta]y², we can make the\r\n  sign of [delta]u depend on that of [delta]y², and so be positive or\r\n  negative as we please. On the other hand, if we take the function u =\r\n  x² - xy² + y^4, x = 0, y = 0 make zero a critical value of u, and here\r\n  [delta]u = [delta]x² - [delta]x[delta]y² + [delta]y^4, which is always\r\n  positive, because we can write it as the sum of two squares, viz.\r\n  ([delta]x - ½[delta]y²)² + ¾[delta]y^4; so that in this case zero is a\r\n  minimum value of u.\r\n\r\n  A critical value usually gives a maximum or minimum in the case of a\r\n  function of one variable, and often in the case of several independent\r\n  variables, but all maxima and minima, particularly absolutely greatest\r\n  and least values, are not necessarily critical values. If, for\r\n  example, x is restricted to lie between the values a and b and\r\n  [phi]´(x) = 0 has no roots in this interval, it follows that [phi]´(x)\r\n  is one-signed as x increases from a to b, so that [phi](x) is\r\n  increasing or diminishing all the time, and the greatest and least\r\n  values of [phi](x) are [phi](a) and [phi](b), though neither of them\r\n  is a critical value. Consider the following example: A person in a\r\n  boat a miles from the nearest point of the beach wishes to reach as\r\n  quickly as possible a point b miles from that point along the shore.\r\n  The ratio of his rate of walking to his rate of rowing is cosec\r\n  [alpha]. Where should he land?\r\n\r\n  Here let AB be the direction of the beach, A the nearest point to the\r\n  boat O, and B the point he wishes to reach. Clearly he must land, if\r\n  at all, between A and B. Suppose he lands at P. Let the angle AOP be\r\n  [theta], so that OP = a sec[theta], and PB = b - a tan [theta]. If his\r\n  rate of rowing is V miles an hour his time will be a sec [theta]/V +\r\n  (b - a tan [theta]) sin [alpha]/V hours. Call this T. Then to the\r\n  first power of [delta][theta], [delta]T = (a/V) sec²[theta] (sin\r\n  [theta] - sin [alpha])[delta][theta], so that if AOB > [alpha],\r\n  [delta]T and [delta][theta] have opposite signs from [theta] = 0 to\r\n  [theta] = [alpha], and the same signs from [theta] = [alpha] to\r\n  [theta] = AOB. So that when AOB is > [alpha], T decreases from [theta]\r\n  = 0 to [theta] = [alpha], and then increases, so that he should land\r\n  at a point distant a tan [alpha] from A, unless a tan [alpha] > b.\r\n  When this is the case, [delta]T and [delta][theta] have opposite signs\r\n  throughout the whole range of [theta], so that T decreases as [theta]\r\n  increases, and he should row direct to B. In the first case the\r\n  minimum value of T is also a critical value; in the second case it is\r\n  not.\r\n\r\n  The greatest and least values of the bending moments of loaded rods\r\n  are often at the extremities of the divisions of the rods and not at\r\n  points given by critical values.\r\n\r\n  In the case of a function of several variables, X1, x2, ... x_n, not\r\n  independent but connected by m functional relations u1 = 0, u2 = 0,\r\n  ..., u_m = 0, we might proceed to eliminate m of the variables; but\r\n  Lagrange's \"Method of undetermined Multipliers\" is more elegant and\r\n  generally more useful.\r\n\r\n  We have [delta]u1 = 0, [delta]u2 = 0, ..., [delta]u_m = 0. Consider\r\n  instead of [delta]u, what is the same thing, viz., [delta]u +\r\n  [lambda]1[delta]u1 + [lambda]2[delta]u2 + ... + [lambda]_m[delta]u_m,\r\n  where [lambda]1, [lambda]2, ... [lambda]_m, are arbitrary multipliers.\r\n  The terms of the first order in this expression are\r\n\r\n     __ [delta]u                        __  [delta]u1                               __ [delta]u_m\r\n    \\   --------- [delta]x1 + [lambda]1 \\   --------- [delta]x1 + ... + [lambda]_m \\   ---------- [delta]x1.\r\n    /__ [delta]x1                       /__ [delta]x1                              /__ [delta]x1\r\n\r\n  We can choose [lambda]1, ... [lambda]_m, to make the coefficients of\r\n  [delta]x1, [delta]x2, ... [delta]x_m, vanish, and the remaining\r\n  [delta]x_(m+1) to [delta]x_n may be regarded as independent, so that,\r\n  when u has a critical value, their coefficients must also vanish. So\r\n  that we put\r\n\r\n     [delta]u              [delta]u1                     [delta]u_m\r\n    ---------- + [lambda]1 ---------- + ... + [lambda]_m ---------- = 0\r\n    [delta]x_r             [delta]x_r                    [delta]x_r\r\n\r\n  for all values of r. These equations with the equations u1 = 0, ...,\r\n  u_m = 0 are exactly enough to determine [lambda]1, ..., [lambda]_m, x1\r\n  x2, ..., x_n, so that we find critical values of u, and examine the\r\n  terms of the second order to decide whether we obtain a maximum or\r\n  minimum.\r\n\r\n  To take a very simple illustration; consider the problem of\r\n  determining the maximum and minimum radii vectors of the ellipsoid\r\n  x²/a² + y²/b² + z²/c² = 1, where a² > b² > c². Here we require the\r\n  maximum and minimum values of x² + y² + z² where x²/a² + y²/b² + z²/c²\r\n  = 1.\r\n\r\n  We have\r\n\r\n                            /    [lambda]\\                 /    [lambda]\\                 /    [lambda]\\\r\n    [delta]u = 2x [delta]x ( 1 + -------- ) + 2y [delta]y ( 1 + -------- ) + 2z [delta]z ( 1 + -------- )\r\n                            \\       a²   /                 \\       b²   /                 \\       c²   /\r\n\r\n                 /    [lambda]\\               /    [lambda]\\               /    [lambda]\\\r\n    + [delta]x² ( 1 + -------- ) + [delta]y² ( 1 + -------- ) + [delta]z² ( 1 + -------- ).\r\n                 \\       a²   /               \\       b²   /               \\       c²   /\r\n\r\n  To make the terms of the first order disappear, we have the three\r\n  equations:--\r\n\r\n  x(1 + [lambda]/a²) = 0, y(1 + [lambda]/b²) = 0, z(1 + [lambda]/c²) =\r\n  0.\r\n\r\n  These have three sets of solutions consistent with the conditions\r\n  x²/a² + y²/b² + z²/c² = 1, a² > b² > c², viz.:--\r\n\r\n    (1) y = 0, z = 0, [lambda] = -a²; (2) z = 0, x = 0, [lambda] = -b²;\r\n\r\n    (3) x = 0, y = 0, [lambda] = -c².\r\n\r\n  In the case of (1) [delta]u = [delta]y² (1 - a²/b²) + [delta]z² (1 -\r\n  a²/c²), which is always negative, so that u = a² gives a maximum.\r\n\r\n  In the case of (3) [delta]u = [delta]x² (1 - c²/a²) + [delta]y² (1 -\r\n  c²/b²), which is always positive, so that u = c² gives a minimum.\r\n\r\n  In the case of (2) [delta]u = [delta]x²(1 - b²/a²) - [delta]z²(b²/c² -\r\n  1), which can be made either positive or negative, or even zero if we\r\n  move in the planes x²(1 - b²/a²) = z²(b²/c² - 1), which are well known\r\n  to be the central planes of circular section. So that u = b², though a\r\n  critical value, is neither a maximum nor minimum, and the central\r\n  planes of circular section divide the ellipsoid into four portions in\r\n  two of which a² > r² > b², and in the other two b² > r² > c².\r\n       (A.

In 287 he suppressed the rising of the\r\npeasants (Bagaudae) in Gaul, but in 289, after a three years' struggle,\r\nhis colleague and he were compelled to acquiesce in the assumption by\r\nhis lieutenant Carausius (who had crossed over to Britain) of the title\r\nof Augustus. After 293 Maximianus left the care of the Rhine frontier to\r\nConstantius Chlorus, who had been designated Caesar in that year, but in\r\n297 his arms achieved a rapid and decisive victory over the barbarians\r\nof Mauretania, and in 302 he shared at Rome the triumph of Diocletian,\r\nthe last pageant of the kind ever witnessed by that city. On the 1st of\r\nMay 305, the day of Diocletian's abdication, he also, but without his\r\ncolleague's sincerity, divested himself of the imperial dignity at\r\nMediolanum (Milan), which had been his capital, and retired to a villa\r\nin Lucania; in the following year, however, he was induced by his son\r\nMaxentius to reassume the purple. In 307 he brought the emperor Flavius\r\nValerius Severus a captive to Rome, and also compelled Galerius to\r\nretreat, but in 308 he was himself driven by Maxentius from Italy into\r\nIllyricum, whence again he was compelled to seek refuge at Arelate\r\n(Arles), the court of his son-in-law, Constantine. Here a false report\r\nwas received, or invented, of the death of Constantine, at that time\r\nabsent on the Rhine. Maximianus at once grasped at the succession, but\r\nwas soon driven to Massilia (Marseilles), where, having been delivered\r\nup to his pursuers, he strangled himself.\r\n\r\n  See Zosimus ii. 7-11; Zonaras xii. 31-33; Eutropius ix. 20, x. 2, 3;\r\n  Aurelius Victor p. 39. For the emperor Galerius Valerius Maximianus\r\n  see GALERIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMILIAN I. (1573-1651), called \"the Great,\" elector and duke of\r\nBavaria, eldest son of William V. of Bavaria, was born at Munich on the\r\n17th of April 1573. He was educated by the Jesuits at the university of\r\nIngolstadt, and began to take part in the government in 1591. He married\r\nin 1595 his cousin, Elizabeth, daughter of Charles II., duke of\r\nLorraine, and became duke of Bavaria upon his father's abdication in\r\n1597. He refrained from any interference in German politics until 1607,\r\nwhen he was entrusted with the duty of executing the imperial ban\r\nagainst the free city of Donauwörth, a Protestant stronghold. In\r\nDecember 1607 his troops occupied the city, and vigorous steps were\r\ntaken to restore the supremacy of the older faith. Some Protestant\r\nprinces, alarmed at this action, formed a union to defend their\r\ninterests, which was answered in 1609 by the establishment of a league,\r\nin the formation of which Maximilian took an important part. Under his\r\nleadership an army was set on foot, but his policy was strictly\r\ndefensive and he refused to allow the league to become a tool in the\r\nhands of the house of Habsburg. Dissensions among his colleagues led the\r\nduke to resign his office in 1616, but the approach of trouble brought\r\nabout his return to the league about two years later.\r\n\r\nHaving refused to become a candidate for the imperial throne in 1619,\r\nMaximilian was faced with the complications arising from the outbreak of\r\nwar in Bohemia. After some delay he made a treaty with the emperor\r\nFerdinand II. in October 1619, and in return for large concessions\r\nplaced the forces of the league at the emperor's service. Anxious to\r\ncurtail the area of the struggle, he made a treaty of neutrality with\r\nthe Protestant Union, and occupied Upper Austria as security for the\r\nexpenses of the campaign. On the 8th of November 1620 his troops under\r\nCount Tilly defeated the forces of Frederick, king of Bohemia and count\r\npalatine of the Rhine, at the White Hill near Prague. In spite of the\r\narrangement with the union Tilly then devastated the Rhenish Palatinate,\r\nand in February 1623 Maximilian was formally invested with the electoral\r\ndignity and the attendant office of imperial steward, which had been\r\nenjoyed since 1356 by the counts palatine of the Rhine. After receiving\r\nthe Upper Palatinate and restoring Upper Austria to Ferdinand,\r\nMaximilian became leader of the party which sought to bring about\r\nWallenstein's dismissal from the imperial service. At the diet of\r\nRegensburg in 1630 Ferdinand was compelled to assent to this demand, but\r\nthe sequel was disastrous both for Bavaria and its ruler. Early in 1632\r\nthe Swedes marched into the duchy and occupied Munich, and Maximilian\r\ncould only obtain the assistance of the imperialists by placing himself\r\nunder the orders of Wallenstein, now restored to the command of the\r\nemperor's forces. The ravages of the Swedes and their French allies\r\ninduced the elector to enter into negotiations for peace with Gustavus\r\nAdolphus and Cardinal Richelieu. He also proposed to disarm the\r\nProtestants by modifying the Restitution edict of 1629; but these\r\nefforts were abortive. In March 1647 he concluded an armistice with\r\nFrance and Sweden at Ulm, but the entreaties of the emperor Ferdinand\r\nIII. led him to disregard his undertaking. Bavaria was again ravaged,\r\nand the elector's forces defeated in May 1648 at Zusmarshausen. But the\r\npeace of Westphalia soon put an end to the struggle. By this treaty it\r\nwas agreed that Maximilian should retain the electoral dignity, which\r\nwas made hereditary in his family; and the Upper Palatinate was\r\nincorporated with Bavaria. The elector died at Ingolstadt on the 27th of\r\nSeptember 1651. By his second wife, Maria Anne, daughter of the emperor\r\nFerdinand II., he left two sons, Ferdinand Maria, who succeeded him, and\r\nMaximilian Philip. In 1839 a statue was erected to his memory at Munich\r\nby Louis I., king of Bavaria. Weak in health and feeble in frame,\r\nMaximilian had high ambitions both for himself and his duchy, and was\r\ntenacious and resourceful in prosecuting his designs. As the ablest\r\nprince of his age he sought to prevent Germany from becoming the\r\nbattleground of Europe, and although a rigid adherent of the Catholic\r\nfaith, was not always subservient to the priest.\r\n\r\n  See P.

(MAXIMILIAN JOSEPH) (1756-1825), king of Bavaria, was the\r\nson of the count palatine Frederick of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld, and was\r\nborn on the 27th of May 1756. He was carefully educated under the\r\nsupervision of his uncle, Duke Christian IV. of Zweibrücken, took\r\nservice in 1777 as a colonel in the French army, and rose rapidly to the\r\nrank of major-general. From 1782 to 1789 he was stationed at Strassburg,\r\nbut at the outbreak of the revolution he exchanged the French for the\r\nAustrian service, taking part in the opening campaigns of the\r\nrevolutionary wars. On the 1st of April 1795 he succeeded his brother,\r\nCharles II., as duke of Zweibrücken, and on the 16th of February 1799\r\nbecame elector of Bavaria on the extinction of the Sulzbach line with\r\nthe death of the elector Charles Theodore.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy with France and with French ideas of enlightenment which\r\ncharacterized his reign was at once manifested. In the newly organized\r\nministry Count Max Josef von Montgelas (q.v.), who, after falling into\r\ndisfavour with Charles Theodore, had acted for a time as Maximilian\r\nJoseph's private secretary, was the most potent influence, an influence\r\nwholly \"enlightened\" and French. Agriculture and commerce were fostered,\r\nthe laws were ameliorated, a new criminal code drawn up, taxes and\r\nimposts equalized without regard to traditional privileges, while a\r\nnumber of religious houses were suppressed and their revenues used for\r\neducational and other useful purposes. In foreign politics Maximilian\r\nJoseph's attitude was from the German point of view less commendable.\r\nWith the growing sentiment of German nationality he had from first to\r\nlast no sympathy, and his attitude throughout was dictated by wholly\r\ndynastic, or at least Bavarian, considerations. Until 1813 he was the\r\nmost faithful of Napoleon's German allies, the relation being cemented\r\nby the marriage of his daughter to Eugène Beauharnais. His reward came\r\nwith the treaty of Pressburg (Dec. 26, 1805), by the terms of which he\r\nwas to receive the royal title and important territorial acquisitions in\r\nSwabia and Franconia to round off his kingdom. The style of king he\r\nactually assumed on the 1st of January 1806.\r\n\r\nThe new king of Bavaria was the most important of the princes belonging\r\nto the Confederation of the Rhine, and remained Napoleon's ally until\r\nthe eve of the battle of Leipzig, when by the convention of Ried (Oct.\r\n8, 1813) he made the guarantee of the integrity of his kingdom the price\r\nof his joining the Allies. By the first treaty of Paris (June 3, 1814),\r\nhowever, he ceded Tirol to Austria in exchange for the former duchy of\r\nWürzburg. At the congress of Vienna, too, which he attended in person,\r\nMaximilian had to make further concessions to Austria, ceding the\r\nquarters of the Inn and Hausruck in return for a part of the old\r\nPalatinate. The king fought hard to maintain the contiguity of the\r\nBavarian territories as guaranteed at Ried; but the most he could obtain\r\nwas an assurance from Metternich in the matter of the Baden succession,\r\nin which he was also doomed to be disappointed (see BADEN: _History_,\r\niii. 506).\r\n\r\nAt Vienna and afterwards Maximilian sturdily opposed any reconstitution\r\nof Germany which should endanger the independence of Bavaria, and it\r\nwas his insistence on the principle of full sovereignty being left to\r\nthe German reigning princes that largely contributed to the loose and\r\nweak organization of the new German Confederation. The Federal Act of\r\nthe Vienna congress was proclaimed in Bavaria, not as a law but as an\r\ninternational treaty. It was partly to secure popular support in his\r\nresistance to any interference of the federal diet in the internal\r\naffairs of Bavaria, partly to give unity to his somewhat heterogeneous\r\nterritories, that Maximilian on the 26th of May 1818 granted a liberal\r\nconstitution to his people. Montgelas, who had opposed this concession,\r\nhad fallen in the previous year, and Maximilian had also reversed his\r\necclesiastical policy, signing on the 24th of October 1817 a concordat\r\nwith Rome by which the powers of the clergy, largely curtailed under\r\nMontgelas's administration, were restored. The new parliament proved so\r\nintractable that in 1819 Maximilian was driven to appeal to the powers\r\nagainst his own creation; but his Bavarian \"particularism\" and his\r\ngenuine popular sympathies prevented him from allowing the Carlsbad\r\ndecrees to be strictly enforced within his dominions. The suspects\r\narrested by order of the Mainz Commission he was accustomed to examine\r\nhimself, with the result that in many cases the whole proceedings were\r\nquashed, and in not a few the accused dismissed with a present of money.\r\nMaximilian died on the 13th of October 1825 and was succeeded by his son\r\nLouis I.\r\n\r\nIn private life Maximilian was kindly and simple. He loved to play the\r\npart of _Landesvater_, walking about the streets of his capital _en\r\nbourgeois_ and entering into conversation with all ranks of his\r\nsubjects, by whom he was regarded with great affection. He was twice\r\nmarried: (1) in 1785 to Princess Wilhelmine Auguste of Hesse-Darmstadt,\r\n(2) in 1797 to Princess Caroline Friederike of Baden.\r\n\r\n  See G. Freiherr von Lerchenfeld, _Gesch. Bayerns unter König\r\n  Maximilian Joseph I._ (Berlin, 1854); J. M. Söltl, _Max Joseph, König\r\n  von Bayern_ (Stuttgart, 1837); L. von Kobell, _Unter den vier ersten\r\n  Königen Bayerns. Nach Briefen und eigenen Erinnerungen_ (Munich,\r\n  1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMILIAN II. (1811-1864), king of Bavaria, son of king Louis I. and of\r\nhis consort Theresa of Saxe-Hildburghausen, was born on the 28th of\r\nNovember 1811. After studying at Göttingen and Berlin and travelling in\r\nGermany, Italy and Greece, he was introduced by his father into the\r\ncouncil of state (1836). From the first he showed a studious\r\ndisposition, declaring on one occasion that had he not been born in a\r\nroyal cradle his choice would have been to become a professor. As crown\r\nprince, in the château of Hohenschwangau near Füssen, which he had\r\nrebuilt with excellent taste, he gathered about him an intimate society\r\nof artists and men of learning, and devoted his time to scientific and\r\nhistorical study. When the abdication of Louis I. (March 28, 1848)\r\ncalled him suddenly to the throne, his choice of ministers promised a\r\nliberal régime. The progress of the revolution, however, gave him pause.\r\nHe strenuously opposed the unionist plans of the Frankfort parliament,\r\nrefused to recognize the imperial constitution devised by it, and\r\nassisted Austria in restoring the federal diet and in carrying out the\r\nfederal execution in Hesse and Holstein. Although, however, from 1850\r\nonwards his government tended in the direction of absolutism, he refused\r\nto become the tool of the clerical reaction, and even incurred the\r\nbitter criticism of the Ultramontanes by inviting a number of celebrated\r\nmen of learning and science (e.g. Liebig and Sybel) to Munich,\r\nregardless of their religious views. Finally, in 1859, he dismissed the\r\nreactionary ministry of von der Pfordten, and met the wishes of his\r\npeople for a moderate constitutional government. In his German policy he\r\nwas guided by the desire to maintain the union of the princes, and hoped\r\nto attain this as against the perilous rivalry of Austria and Prussia by\r\nthe creation of a league of the \"middle\" and small states--the so-called\r\nTrias. In 1863, however, seeing what he thought to be a better way, he\r\nsupported the project of reform proposed by Austria at the Fürstentag of\r\nFrankfort. The failure of this proposal, and the attitude of Austria\r\ntowards the Confederation and in the Schleswig-Holstein question,\r\nundeceived him; but before he could deal with the new situation created\r\nby the outbreak of the war with Denmark he died suddenly at Munich, on\r\nthe 10th of March 1864.\r\n\r\nMaximilian was a man of amiable qualities and of intellectual\r\nattainments far above the average, but as a king he was hampered by\r\nconstant ill-health, which compelled him to be often abroad, and when at\r\nhome to live much in the country. By his wife, Maria Hedwig, daughter of\r\nPrince William of Prussia, whom he married in 1842, he had two sons,\r\nLouis II., king of Bavaria, and Otto, king of Bavaria, both of whom lost\r\ntheir reason.\r\n\r\n  See J. M. Söltl, _Max der Zweite, König von Bayern_ (Munich, 1865);\r\n  biography by G. K. Heigel in _Allgem. Deutsche Biographie_, vol. xxi.\r\n  (Leipzig, 1885). Maximilian's correspondence with Schlegel was\r\n  published at Stuttgart in 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMILIAN I. (1459-1519), Roman emperor, son of the emperor Frederick\r\nIII. and Leonora, daughter of Edward, king of Portugal, was born at\r\nVienna Neustadt on the 22nd of March 1459. On the 18th of August 1477,\r\nby his marriage at Ghent to Mary, who had just inherited Burgundy and\r\nthe Netherlands from her father Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, he\r\neffected a union of great importance in the history of the house of\r\nHabsburg. He at once undertook the defence of his wife's dominions from\r\nan attack by Louis XI., king of France, and defeated the French forces\r\nat Guinegatte, the modern Enguinegatte, on the 7th of August 1479. But\r\nMaximilian was regarded with suspicion by the states of Netherlands, and\r\nafter suppressing a rising in Gelderland his position was further\r\nweakened by the death of his wife on the 27th of March 1482. He claimed\r\nto be recognized as guardian of his young son Philip and as regent of\r\nthe Netherlands, but some of the states refused to agree to his demands\r\nand disorder was general. Maximilian was compelled to assent to the\r\ntreaty of Arras in 1482 between the states of the Netherlands and Louis\r\nXI. This treaty provided that Maximilian's daughter Margaret should\r\nmarry Charles, the dauphin of France, and have for her dowry Artois and\r\nFranche-Comté, two of the provinces in dispute, while the claim of Louis\r\non the duchy of Burgundy was tacitly admitted. Maximilian did not,\r\nhowever, abandon the struggle in the Netherlands. Having crushed a\r\nrebellion at Utrecht, he compelled the burghers of Ghent to restore\r\nPhilip to him in 1485, and returning to Germany was chosen king of the\r\nRomans, or German king, at Frankfort on the 16th of February 1486, and\r\ncrowned at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 9th of the following April. Again in\r\nthe Netherlands, he made a treaty with Francis II., duke of Brittany,\r\nwhose independence was threatened by the French regent, Anne of Beaujeu,\r\nand the struggle with France was soon renewed. This war was very\r\nunpopular with the trading cities of the Netherlands, and early in 1488\r\nMaximilian, having entered Bruges, was detained there as a prisoner for\r\nnearly three months, and only set at liberty on the approach of his\r\nfather with a large force. On his release he had promised he would\r\nmaintain the treaty of Arras and withdraw from the Netherlands; but he\r\ndelayed his departure for nearly a year and took part in a punitive\r\ncampaign against his captors and their allies. On his return to Germany\r\nhe made peace with France at Frankfort in July 1489, and in October\r\nseveral of the states of the Netherlands recognized him as their ruler\r\nand as guardian of his son. In March 1490 the county of Tirol was added\r\nto his possessions through the abdication of his kinsman, Count\r\nSigismund, and this district soon became his favourite residence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the king had formed an alliance with Henry VII. king of\r\nEngland, and Ferdinand II., king of Aragon, to defend the possessions of\r\nthe duchess Anne, daughter and successor of Francis, duke of Brittany.\r\nEarly in 1490 he took a further step and was betrothed to the duchess,\r\nand later in the same year the marriage was celebrated by proxy; but\r\nBrittany was still occupied by French troops, and Maximilian was unable\r\nto go to the assistance of his bride. The sequel was startling. In\r\nDecember 1491 Anne was married to Charles VIII., king of France, and\r\nMaximilian's daughter Margaret, who had resided in France since her\r\nbetrothal, was sent back to her father. The inaction of Maximilian at\r\nthis time is explained by the condition of affairs in Hungary, where\r\nthe death of king Matthias Corvinus had brought about a struggle for\r\nthis throne. The Roman king, who was an unsuccessful candidate, took up\r\narms, drove the Hungarians from Austria, and regained Vienna, which had\r\nbeen in the possession of Matthias since 1485; but he was compelled by\r\nwant of money to retreat, and on the 7th of November 1491 signed the\r\ntreaty of Pressburg with Ladislaus, king of Bohemia, who had obtained\r\nthe Hungarian throne. By this treaty it was agreed that Maximilian\r\nshould succeed to the crown in case Ladislaus left no legitimate male\r\nissue. Having defeated the invading Turks at Villach in 1492, the king\r\nwas eager to take revenge upon the king of France; but the states of the\r\nNetherlands would afford him no assistance. The German diet was\r\nindifferent, and in May 1493 he agreed to the peace of Senlis and\r\nregained Artois and Franche-Comté.\r\n\r\nIn August 1493 the death of the emperor left Maximilian sole ruler of\r\nGermany and head of the house of Habsburg; and on the 16th of March 1494\r\nhe married at Innsbruck Bianca Maria Sforza, daughter of Galeazzo\r\nSforza, duke of Milan (d. 1476). At this time Bianca's uncle, Ludovico\r\nSforza, was invested with the duchy of Milan in return for the\r\nsubstantial dowry which his niece brought to the king. Maximilian\r\nharboured the idea of driving the Turks from Europe; but his appeal to\r\nall Christian sovereigns was ineffectual. In 1494 he was again in the\r\nNetherlands, where he led an expedition against the rebels of\r\nGelderland, assisted Perkin Warbeck to make a descent upon England, and\r\nformally handed over the government of the Low Countries to Philip. His\r\nattention was next turned to Italy, and, alarmed at the progress of\r\nCharles VIII. in the peninsula, he signed the league of Venice in March\r\n1495, and about the same time arranged a marriage between his son Philip\r\nand Joanna, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, king and queen of\r\nCastile and Aragon. The need for help to prosecute the war in Italy\r\ncaused the king to call the diet to Worms in March 1495, when he urged\r\nthe necessity of checking the progress of Charles. As during his\r\nfather's lifetime Maximilian had favoured the reforming party among the\r\nprinces, proposals for the better government of the empire were brought\r\nforward at Worms as a necessary preliminary to financial and military\r\nsupport. Some reforms were adopted, the public peace was proclaimed\r\nwithout any limitation of time and a general tax was levied. The three\r\nsucceeding years were mainly occupied with quarrels with the diet, with\r\ntwo invasions of France, and a war in Gelderland against Charles, count\r\nof Egmont, who claimed that duchy, and was supported by French troops.\r\nThe reforms of 1495 were rendered abortive by the refusal of Maximilian\r\nto attend the diets or to take any part in the working of the new\r\nconstitution, and in 1497 he strengthened his own authority by\r\nestablishing an Aulic Council (_Reichshofrath_), which he declared was\r\ncompetent to deal with all business of the empire, and about the same\r\ntime set up a court to centralize the financial administration of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn February 1499 the king became involved in a war with the Swiss, who\r\nhad refused to pay the imperial taxes or to furnish a contribution for\r\nthe Italian expedition. Aided by France they defeated the German troops,\r\nand the peace of Basel in September 1499 recognized them as virtually\r\nindependent of the empire. About this time Maximilian's ally, Ludovico\r\nof Milan, was taken prisoner by Louis XII., king of France, and\r\nMaximilian was again compelled to ask the diet for help. An elaborate\r\nscheme for raising an army was agreed to, and in return a council of\r\nregency (_Reichsregiment_) was established, which amounted, in the words\r\nof a Venetian envoy, to a deposition of the king. The relations were now\r\nvery strained between the reforming princes and Maximilian, who, unable\r\nto raise an army, refused to attend the meetings of the council at\r\nNuremberg, while both parties treated for peace with France. The\r\nhostility of the king rendered the council impotent. He was successful\r\nin winning the support of many of the younger princes, and in\r\nestablishing a new court of justice, the members of which were named by\r\nhimself. The negotiations with France ended in the treaty of Blois,\r\nsigned in September 1504, when Maximilian's grandson Charles was\r\nbetrothed to Claude, daughter of Louis XII., and Louis, invested with\r\nthe duchy of Milan, agreed to aid the king of the Romans to secure the\r\nimperial crown. A succession difficulty in Bavaria-Landshut was only\r\ndecided after Maximilian had taken up arms and narrowly escaped with his\r\nlife at Regensburg. In the settlement of this question, made in 1505, he\r\nsecured a considerable increase of territory, and when the king met the\r\ndiet at Cologne in 1505 he was at the height of his power. His enemies\r\nat home were crushed, and their leader, Berthold, elector of Mainz, was\r\ndead; while the outlook abroad was more favourable than it had been\r\nsince his accession.\r\n\r\nIt is at this period that Ranke believes Maximilian to have entertained\r\nthe idea of a universal monarchy; but whatever hopes he may have had\r\nwere shattered by the death of his son Philip and the rupture of the\r\ntreaty of Blois. The diet of Cologne discussed the question of reform in\r\na halting fashion, but afforded the king supplies for an expedition into\r\nHungary, to aid his ally Ladislaus, and to uphold his own influence in\r\nthe East. Having established his daughter Margaret as regent for Charles\r\nin the Netherlands, Maximilian met the diet at Constance in 1507, when\r\nthe imperial chamber (_Reichskammergericht_) was revised and took a more\r\npermanent form, and help was granted for an expedition to Italy. The\r\nking set out for Rome to secure his coronation, but Venice refused to\r\nlet him pass through her territories; and at Trant, on the 4th of\r\nFebruary 1508, he took the important step of assuming the title of Roman\r\nEmperor Elect, to which he soon received the assent of pope Julius II.\r\nHe attacked the Venetians, but finding the war unpopular with the\r\ntrading cities of southern Germany, made a truce with the republic for\r\nthree years. The treaty of Blois had contained a secret article\r\nproviding for an attack on Venice, and this ripened into the league of\r\nCambray, which was joined by the emperor in December 1509. He soon took\r\nthe field, but after his failure to capture Padua the league broke up;\r\nand his sole ally, the French king, joined him in calling a general\r\ncouncil at Pisa to discuss the question of Church reform. A breach with\r\npope Julius followed, and at this time Maximilian appears to have\r\nentertained, perhaps quite seriously, the idea of seating himself in the\r\nchair of St Peter. After a period of vacillation he deserted Louis and\r\njoined the Holy League, which had been formed to expel the French from\r\nItaly; but unable to raise troops, he served with the English forces as\r\na volunteer and shared in the victory gained over the French at the\r\nbattle of the Spurs near Thérouanne on the 16th of August 1513. In 1500\r\nthe diet had divided Germany into six circles, for the maintenance of\r\npeace, to which the emperor at the diet of Cologne in 1512 added four\r\nothers. Having made an alliance with Christian II., king of Denmark, and\r\ninterfered to protect the Teutonic Order against Sigismund I., king of\r\nPoland, Maximilian was again in Italy early in 1516 fighting the French\r\nwho had overrun Milan. His want of success compelled him on the 4th of\r\nDecember 1516 to sign the treaty of Brussels, which left Milan in the\r\nhands of the French king, while Verona was soon afterwards transferred\r\nto Venice. He attempted in vain to secure the election of his grandson\r\nCharles as king of the Romans, and in spite of increasing infirmity was\r\neager to lead the imperial troops against the Turks. At the diet of\r\nAugsburg in 1518 the emperor heard warnings of the Reformation in the\r\nshape of complaints against papal exactions, and a repetition of the\r\ncomplaints preferred at the diet of Mainz in 1517 about the\r\nadministration of Germany. Leaving the diet, he travelled to Wels in\r\nUpper Austria, where he died on the 12th of January 1519. He was buried\r\nin the church of St George in Vienna Neustadt, and a superb monument,\r\nwhich may still be seen, was raised to his memory at Innsbruck.\r\n\r\n  Maximilian had many excellent personal qualities. He was not handsome,\r\n  but of a robust and well-proportioned frame. Simple in his habits,\r\n  conciliatory in his bearing, and catholic in his tastes, he enjoyed\r\n  great popularity and rarely made a personal enemy. He was a skilled\r\n  knight and a daring huntsman, and although not a great general, was\r\n  intrepid on the field of battle. His mental interests were extensive.\r\n  He knew something of six languages, and could discuss art, music,\r\n  literature or theology. He reorganized the university of Vienna and\r\n  encouraged the development of the universities of Ingolstadt and\r\n  Freiburg. He was the friend and patron of scholars, caused manuscripts\r\n  to be copied and medieval poems to be collected. He was the author of\r\n  military reforms, which included the establishment of standing troops,\r\n  called _Landsknechte_, the improvement of artillery by making cannon\r\n  portable, and some changes in the equipment of the cavalry. He was\r\n  continually devising plans for the better government of Austria, and\r\n  although they ended in failure, he established the unity of the\r\n  Austrian dominions. Maximilian has been called the second founder of\r\n  the house of Habsburg, and certainly by bringing about marriages\r\n  between Charles and Joanna and between his grandson Ferdinand and\r\n  Anna, daughter of Ladislaus, king of Hungary and Bohemia, he paved the\r\n  way for the vast empire of Charles V. and for the influence of the\r\n  Habsburgs in eastern Europe. But he had many qualities less desirable.\r\n  He was reckless and unstable, resorting often to lying and deceit, and\r\n  never pausing to count the cost of an enterprise or troubling to adapt\r\n  means to ends. For absurd and impracticable schemes in Italy and\r\n  elsewhere he neglected Germany, and sought to involve its princes in\r\n  wars undertaken solely for private aggrandizement or personal\r\n  jealousy. Ignoring his responsibilities as ruler of Germany, he only\r\n  considered the question of its government when in need of money and\r\n  support from the princes. As the \"last of the knights\" he could not\r\n  see that the old order of society was passing away and a new order\r\n  arising, while he was fascinated by the glitter of the medieval empire\r\n  and spent the better part of his life in vague schemes for its\r\n  revival. As \"a gifted amateur in politics\" he increased the disorder\r\n  of Germany and Italy and exposed himself and the empire to the jeers\r\n  of Europe.\r\n\r\n  Maximilian was also a writer of books, and his writings display his\r\n  inordinate vanity. His _Geheimes Jagdbuch_, containing about 2500\r\n  words, is a treatise purporting to teach his grandsons the art of\r\n  hunting. He inspired the production of _The Dangers and Adventures of\r\n  the Famous Hero and Knight Sir Teuerdank_, an allegorical poem\r\n  describing his adventures on his journey to marry Mary of Burgundy.\r\n  The emperor's share in the work is not clear, but it seems certain\r\n  that the general scheme and many of the incidents are due to him. It\r\n  was first published at Nuremberg by Melchior Pfintzing in 1517, and\r\n  was adorned with woodcuts by Hans Leonhard Schäufelein. The\r\n  _Weisskunig_ was long regarded as the work of the emperor's secretary,\r\n  Marx Treitzsaurwein, but it is now believed that the greater part of\r\n  the book at least is the work of the emperor himself. It is an\r\n  unfinished autobiography containing an account of the achievements of\r\n  Maximilian, who is called \"the young white king.\" It was first\r\n  published at Vienna in 1775. He also is responsible for _Freydal_, an\r\n  allegorical account of the tournaments in which he took part during\r\n  his wooing of Mary of Burgundy; _Ehrenpforten_, _Triumphwagen_ and\r\n  _Der weisen könige Stammbaum_, books concerning his own history and\r\n  that of the house of Habsburg, and works on various subjects, as _Das\r\n  Stahlbuch_, _Die Baumeisterei_ and _Die Gärtnerei_. These works are\r\n  all profusely illustrated, some by Albrecht Dürer, and in the\r\n  preparation of the woodcuts Maximilian himself took the liveliest\r\n  interest. A facsimile of the original editions of Maximilian's\r\n  autobiographical and semi-autobiographical works has been published in\r\n  nine volumes in the _Jahrbücher der kunsthistorischen Sammlungen des\r\n  Kaiserhauses_ (Vienna, 1880-1888). For this edition S. Laschitzer\r\n  wrote an introduction to _Sir Teuerdank_, Q. von Leitner to _Freydal_,\r\n  and N. A. von Schultz to _Der Weisskunig_. The Holbein society issued\r\n  a facsimile of _Sir Teuerdank_ (London, 1884) and _Triumphwagen_\r\n  (London, 1883).\r\n\r\n  See _Correspondance de l'empereur Maximilien I. et de Marguerite\r\n  d'Autriche, 1507-1519_, edited by A.

H.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMILIAN II. (1527-1576), Roman emperor, was the eldest son of the\r\nemperor Ferdinand I. by his wife Anne, daughter of Ladislaus, king of\r\nHungary and Bohemia, and was born in Vienna on the 31st of July 1527.\r\nEducated principally in Spain, he gained some experience of warfare\r\nduring the campaign of Charles V. against France in 1544, and also\r\nduring the war of the league of Schmalkalden, and soon began to take\r\npart in imperial business. Having in September 1548 married his cousin\r\nMaria, daughter of Charles V., he acted as the emperor's representative\r\nin Spain from 1548 to 1550, returning to Germany in December 1550 in\r\norder to take part in the discussion over the imperial succession.\r\nCharles V. wished his son Philip (afterwards king of Spain) to succeed\r\nhim as emperor, but his brother Ferdinand, who had already been\r\ndesignated as the next occupant of the imperial throne, and Maximilian\r\nobjected to this proposal. At length a compromise was reached. Philip\r\nwas to succeed Ferdinand, but during the former's reign Maximilian, as\r\nking of the Romans, was to govern Germany. This arrangement was not\r\ncarried out, and is only important because the insistence of the emperor\r\nseriously disturbed the harmonious relations which had hitherto existed\r\nbetween the two branches of the Habsburg family; and the estrangement\r\nwent so far that an illness which befell Maximilian in 1552 was\r\nattributed to poison given to him in the interests of his cousin and\r\nbrother-in-law, Philip of Spain. About this time he took up his\r\nresidence in Vienna, and was engaged mainly in the government of the\r\nAustrian dominions and in defending them against the Turks. The\r\nreligious views of the king of Bohemia, as Maximilian had been called\r\nsince his recognition as the future ruler of that country in 1549, had\r\nalways been somewhat uncertain, and he had probably learned something of\r\nLutheranism in his youth; but his amicable relations with several\r\nProtestant princes, which began about the time of the discussion over\r\nthe succession, were probably due more to political than to religious\r\nconsiderations. However, in Vienna he became very intimate with\r\nSebastian Pfauser (1520-1569), a court preacher with strong leanings\r\ntowards Lutheranism, and his religious attitude caused some uneasiness\r\nto his father. Fears were freely expressed that he would definitely\r\nleave the Catholic Church, and when Ferdinand became emperor in 1558 he\r\nwas prepared to assure Pope Paul IV. that his son should not succeed him\r\nif he took this step. Eventually Maximilian remained nominally an\r\nadherent of the older faith, although his views were tinged with\r\nLutheranism until the end of his life. After several refusals he\r\nconsented in 1560 to the banishment of Pfauser, and began again to\r\nattend the services of the Catholic Church. This uneasiness having been\r\ndispelled, in November 1562 Maximilian was chosen king of the Romans, or\r\nGerman king, at Frankfort, where he was crowned a few days later, after\r\nassuring the Catholic electors of his fidelity to their faith, and\r\npromising the Protestant electors that he would publicly accept the\r\nconfession of Augsburg when he became emperor. He also took the usual\r\noath to protect the Church, and his election was afterwards confirmed by\r\nthe papacy. In September 1563 he was crowned king of Hungary, and on his\r\nfather's death, in July 1564, succeeded to the empire and to the\r\nkingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThe new emperor had already shown that he believed in the necessity for\r\na thorough reform of the Church. He was unable, however, to obtain the\r\nconsent of Pope Pius IV. to the marriage of the clergy, and in 1568 the\r\nconcession of communion in both kinds to the laity was withdrawn. On his\r\npart Maximilian granted religious liberty to the Lutheran nobles and\r\nknights in Austria, and refused to allow the publication of the decrees\r\nof the council of Trent. Amid general expectations on the part of the\r\nProtestants he met his first Diet at Augsburg in March 1566. He refused\r\nto accede to the demands of the Lutheran princes; on the other hand,\r\nalthough the increase of sectarianism was discussed, no decisive steps\r\nwere taken to suppress it, and the only result of the meeting was a\r\ngrant of assistance for the Turkish War, which had just been renewed.\r\nCollecting a large and splendid army Maximilian marched to defend his\r\nterritories; but no decisive engagement had taken place when a truce was\r\nmade in 1568, and the emperor continued to pay tribute to the sultan for\r\nHungary. Meanwhile the relations between Maximilian and Philip of Spain\r\nhad improved; and the emperor's increasingly cautious and moderate\r\nattitude in religious matters was doubtless due to the fact that the\r\ndeath of Philip's son, Don Carlos, had opened the way for the succession\r\nof Maximilian, or of one of his sons, to the Spanish throne. Evidence\r\nof this friendly feeling was given in 1570, when the emperor's daughter,\r\nAnne, became the fourth wife of Philip; but Maximilian was unable to\r\nmoderate the harsh proceedings of the Spanish king against the revolting\r\ninhabitants of the Netherlands. In 1570 the emperor met the diet at\r\nSpires and asked for aid to place his eastern borders in a state of\r\ndefence, and also for power to repress the disorder caused by troops in\r\nthe service of foreign powers passing through Germany. He proposed that\r\nhis consent should be necessary before any soldiers for foreign service\r\nwere recruited in the empire; but the estates were unwilling to\r\nstrengthen the imperial authority, the Protestant princes regarded the\r\nsuggestion as an attempt to prevent them from assisting their\r\ncoreligionists in France and the Netherlands, and nothing was done in\r\nthis direction, although some assistance was voted for the defence of\r\nAustria. The religious demands of the Protestants were still\r\nunsatisfied, while the policy of toleration had failed to give peace to\r\nAustria. Maximilian's power was very limited; it was inability rather\r\nthan unwillingness that prevented him from yielding to the entreaties of\r\nPope Pius V. to join in an attack on the Turks both before and after the\r\nvictory of Lepanto in 1571; and he remained inert while the authority of\r\nthe empire in north-eastern Europe was threatened. His last important\r\nact was to make a bid for the throne of Poland, either for himself or\r\nfor his son Ernest. In December 1575 he was elected by a powerful\r\nfaction, but the diet which met at Regensburg was loath to assist; and\r\non the 12th of October 1576 the emperor died, refusing on his deathbed\r\nto receive the last sacraments of the Church.\r\n\r\nBy his wife Maria he had a family of nine sons and six daughters. He was\r\nsucceeded by his eldest surviving son, Rudolph, who had been chosen king\r\nof the Romans in October 1575. Another of his sons, Matthias, also\r\nbecame emperor; three others, Ernest, Albert and Maximilian, took some\r\npart in the government of the Habsburg territories or of the\r\nNetherlands, and a daughter, Elizabeth, married Charles IX. king of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n  The religious attitude of Maximilian has given rise to much\r\n  discussion, and on this subject the writings of W. Maurenbrecher, W.\r\n  Goetz and E. Reimann in the _Historische Zeitschrift_, Bände VII.,\r\n  XV., XXXII. and LXXVII. (Munich, 1870 fol.) should be consulted, and\r\n  also O. H.

Christie (London, 1896 fol.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMILIAN (1832-1867), emperor of Mexico, second son of the archduke\r\nFrancis Charles of Austria, was born in the palace of Schönbrunn, on the\r\n6th of July 1832. He was a particularly clever boy, showed considerable\r\ntaste for the arts, and early displayed an interest in science,\r\nespecially botany. He was trained for the navy, and threw himself into\r\nthis career with so much zeal that he quickly rose to high command, and\r\nwas mainly instrumental in creating the naval port of Trieste and the\r\nfleet with which Tegethoff won his victories in the Italian War. He had\r\nsome reputation as a Liberal, and this led, in February 1857, to his\r\nappointment as viceroy of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom; in the same\r\nyear he married the Princess Charlotte, daughter of Leopold I., king of\r\nthe Belgians. On the outbreak of the war of 1859 he retired into private\r\nlife, chiefly at Trieste, near which he built the beautiful chateau of\r\nMiramar. In this same year he was first approached by Mexican exiles\r\nwith the proposal to become the candidate for the throne of Mexico. He\r\ndid not at first accept, but sought to satisfy his restless desire for\r\nadventure by a botanical expedition to the tropical forests of Brazil.\r\nIn 1863, however, under pressure from Napoleon III., and after General\r\nForey's capture of the city of Mexico and the plebiscite which confirmed\r\nhis proclamation of the empire, he consented to accept the crown. This\r\ndecision was contrary to the advice of his brother, the emperor Francis\r\nJoseph, and involved the loss of all his rights in Austria. Maximilian\r\nlanded at Vera Cruz on the 28th of May 1864; but from the very outset he\r\nfound himself involved in difficulties of the most serious kind, which\r\nin 1866 made apparent to almost every one outside of Mexico the\r\nnecessity for his abdicating. Though urged to this course by Napoleon\r\nhimself, whose withdrawal from Mexico was the final blow to his cause,\r\nMaximilian refused to desert his followers. Withdrawing, in February\r\n1867, to Querétaro, he there sustained a siege for several weeks, but on\r\nthe 15th of May resolved to attempt an escape through the enemy's lines.\r\nHe was, however, arrested before he could carry out this resolution, and\r\nafter trial by court-martial was condemned to death. The sentence was\r\ncarried out on the 19th of June 1867. His remains were conveyed to\r\nVienna, where they were buried in the imperial vault early in the\r\nfollowing year. (See MEXICO.)\r\n\r\n  Maximilian's papers were published at Leipzig in 1867, in seven\r\n  volumes, under the title _Aus meinem Leben, Reiseskizzen, Aphorismen,\r\n  Gedichte._ See Pierre de la Gorce, _Hist. du Second Empire_, IV., liv.\r\n  xxv. ii. (Paris, 1904); article by von Hoffinger in _Allgemeine\r\n  Deutsche Biographie_, xxi. 70, where authorities are cited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMINUS, GAIUS JULIUS VERUS, Roman emperor from A.D. 235 to 238, was\r\nborn in a village on the confines of Thrace. He was of barbarian\r\nparentage and was brought up as a shepherd. His immense stature and\r\nenormous feats of strength attracted the attention of the emperor\r\nSeptimius Severus. He entered the army, and under Caracalla rose to the\r\nrank of centurion. He carefully absented himself from court during the\r\nreign of Heliogabalus, but under his successor Alexander Severus, was\r\nappointed supreme commander of the Roman armies. After the murder of\r\nAlexander in Gaul, hastened, it is said, by his instigation, Maximinus\r\nwas proclaimed emperor by the soldiers on the 19th of March 235. The\r\nthree years of his reign, which were spent wholly in the camp, were\r\nmarked by great cruelty and oppression; the widespread discontent thus\r\nproduced culminated in a revolt in Africa and the assumption of the\r\npurple by Gordian (q.v.). Maximinus, who was in Pannonia at the time,\r\nmarched against Rome, and passing over the Julian Alps descended on\r\nAquileia; while detained before that city he and his son were murdered\r\nin their tent by a body of praetorians. Their heads were cut off and\r\ndespatched to Rome, where they were burnt on the Campus Martius by the\r\nexultant crowd.\r\n\r\n  Capitolinus, _Maximini duo_; Herodian vi. 8, vii., viii. 1-5; Zosimus\r\n  i. 13-15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMINUS [MAXIMIN], GALERIUS VALERIUS, Roman emperor from A.D. 308 to\r\n314, was originally an Illyrian shepherd named Daia. He rose to high\r\ndistinction after he had joined the army, and in 305 he was raised by\r\nhis uncle, Galerius, to the rank of Caesar, with the government of Syria\r\nand Egypt. In 308, after the elevation of Licinius, he insisted on\r\nreceiving the title of Augustus; on the death of Galerius, in 311, he\r\nsucceeded to the supreme command of the provinces of Asia, and when\r\nLicinius and Constantine began to make common cause with one another\r\nMaximinus entered into a secret alliance with Maxentius. He came to an\r\nopen rupture with Licinius in 313, sustained a crushing defeat in the\r\nneighbourhood of Heraclea Pontica on the 30th of April, and fled, first\r\nto Nicomedia and afterwards to Tarsus, where he died in August\r\nfollowing. His death was variously ascribed \"to despair, to poison, and\r\nto the divine justice.\" Maximinus has a bad name in Christian annals, as\r\nhaving renewed persecution after the publication of the toleration edict\r\nof Galerius, but it is probable that he has been judged too harshly.\r\n\r\n  See MAXENTIUS; Zosimus ii. 8; Aurelius Victor, _Epit_. 40.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMS, LEGAL. A maxim is an established principle or proposition. The\r\nLatin term _maxima_ is not to be found in Roman law with any meaning\r\nexactly analogous to that of a legal maxim in the modern sense of the\r\nword, but the treatises of many of the Roman jurists on _Regulae\r\ndefinitiones_, and _Sententiae juris_ are, in some measure, collections\r\nof maxims (see an article on \"Latin Maxims in English Law\" in _Law Mag.\r\nand Rev._ xx. 285); Fortescue (_De laudibus_, c. 8) and Du Cange treat\r\n_maxima_ and _regula_ as identical. The attitude of early English\r\ncommentators towards the maxims of the law was one of unmingled\r\nadulation. In _Doctor and Student_ (p. 26) they are described as \"of the\r\nsame strength and effect in the law as statutes be.\" Coke (Co. _Litt._\r\n11 A) says that a maxim is so called \"Quia maxima est ejus dignitas et\r\ncertissima auctoritas, atque quod maxime omnibus probetur.\" \"Not only,\"\r\nobserves Bacon in the Preface to his _Collection of Maxims_, \"will the\r\nuse of maxims be in deciding doubt and helping soundness of judgment,\r\nbut, further, in gracing argument, in correcting unprofitable subtlety,\r\nand reducing the same to a more sound and substantial sense of law, in\r\nreclaiming vulgar errors, and, generally, in the amendment in some\r\nmeasure of the very nature and complexion of the whole law.\" A similar\r\nnote was sounded in Scotland; and it has been well observed that \"a\r\nglance at the pages of Morrison's _Dictionary_ or at other early reports\r\nwill show how frequently in the older Scots law questions respecting the\r\nrights, remedies and liabilities of individuals were determined by an\r\nimmediate reference to legal maxims\" (J. M. Irving, _Encyclo. Scots\r\nLaw_, s.v. \"Maxims\"). In later times less value has been attached to the\r\nmaxims of the law, as the development of civilization and the increasing\r\ncomplexity of business relations have shown the necessity of qualifying\r\nthe propositions which they enunciate (see Stephen, _Hist. Crim. Law_,\r\nii. 94 _n: Yarmouth_ v. _France_, 1887, 19 Q.B.D., per Lord Esher, at p.\r\n653, and American authorities collected in Bouvier's _Law Dict._ s.v.\r\n\"Maxim\"). But both historically and practically they must always possess\r\ninterest and value.\r\n\r\n  A brief reference need only be made here, with examples by way of\r\n  illustration, to the field which the maxims of the law cover.\r\n\r\n  Commencing with rules founded on public policy, we may note the famous\r\n  principle--_Salus populi suprema lex_ (xii. Tables: Bacon, _Maxims_,\r\n  reg. 12)--\"the public welfare is the highest law.\" It is on this maxim\r\n  that the coercive action of the State towards individual liberty in a\r\n  hundred matters is based. To the same category belong the\r\n  maxims--_Summa ratio est quae pro religione facit_ (Co. _Litt._ 341\r\n  a)--\"the best rule is that which advances religion\"--a maxim which\r\n  finds its application when the enforcement of foreign laws or\r\n  judgments supposed to violate our own laws or the principles of\r\n  natural justice is in question; and _Dies dominicus non est\r\n  juridicus_, which exempts Sunday from the lawful days for juridical\r\n  acts. Among the maxims relating to the crown, the most important are\r\n  _Rex non potest peccare_ (2 Rolle R. 304)--\"The King can do no\r\n  wrong\"--which enshrines the principle of ministerial responsibility,\r\n  and _Nullum tempus occurrit regi_ (2 Co. Inst. 273)--\"lapse of time\r\n  does not bar the crown,\" a maxim qualified by various enactments in\r\n  modern times. Passing to the judicial office and the administration of\r\n  justice, we may refer to the rules--_Audi alteram partem_--a\r\n  proposition too familiar to need either translation or comment; _Nemo\r\n  debet esse judex in propriâ suâ causâ_ (12 Co. _Rep._ 114)--\"no man\r\n  ought to be judge in his own cause\"--a maxim which French law, and the\r\n  legal systems based upon or allied to it, have embodied in an\r\n  elaborate network of rules for judicial challenge; and the maxim which\r\n  defines the relative functions of judge and jury, _Ad quaestionem\r\n  facti non respondent judices, ad quaestionem legis non respondent\r\n  juratores_ (8 Co. _Rep._ 155). The maxim _Boni judicis est ampliare\r\n  jurisdictionem_ (Ch. Prec. 329) is certainly erroneous as it stands,\r\n  as a judge has no right to \"extend his jurisdiction.\" If _justitiam_\r\n  is substituted for _jurisdictionem_, as Lord Mansfield said it should\r\n  be (1 Burr. 304), the maxim is near the truth. A group of maxims\r\n  supposed to embody certain fundamental principles of legal right and\r\n  obligations may next be referred to: (a) _Ubi jus ibi remedium_ (see\r\n  Co. _Litt._ 197 b)--a maxim to which the evolution of the flexible\r\n  \"action on the case,\" by which wrongs unknown to the \"original writs\"\r\n  were dealt with, was historically due, but which must be taken with\r\n  the gloss _Damnum absque injuria_--\"there are forms of actual damage\r\n  which do not constitute legal injury\" for which the law supplies no\r\n  remedy; (b) _Actus Dei nemini facit injuriam_ (2 Blackstone, 122)--and\r\n  its allied maxim, _Lex non cogit ad impossibilia_ (Co. _Litt._ 231\r\n  b)--on which the whole doctrine of _vis major_ (_force majeure_) and\r\n  impossible conditions in the law of contract has been built up. In\r\n  this category may also be classed _Volenti non fit injuria_ (Wingate,\r\n  _Maxims_), out of which sprang the theory--now profoundly modified by\r\n  statute--of \"common employment\" in the law of employers' liability;\r\n  see _Smith_ v. _Baker_, 1891, A.C. 325. Other maxims deal with rights\r\n  of property--_Qui prior est tempore, potior est jure_ (Co. _Litt._ 14\r\n  a), which consecrates the position of the _beati possidentes_ alike in\r\n  municipal and in international law; _Sic utere tuo ut alienum non\r\n  laedas_ (9 Co. _Rep._ 59), which has played its part in the\r\n  determination of the rights of adjacent owners; and _Domus sua cuique\r\n  est tutissimum refugium_ (5 Co. _Rep._ 92)--\"a man's house is his\r\n  castle,\" a doctrine which has imposed limitations on the rights of\r\n  execution creditors (see EXECUTION). In the laws of family relations\r\n  there are the maxims _Consensus non concubitus facit matrimonium_ (Co.\r\n  _Litt._ 33 a)--the canon law of Europe prior to the council of Trent,\r\n  and still law in Scotland, though modified by legislation in England;\r\n  and _Pater is est quem nuptiae demonstrant_ (see Co. _Litt._ 7 b), on\r\n  which, in most civilized countries, the presumption of legitimacy\r\n  depends. In the interpretation of written instruments, the maxim\r\n  _Noscitur a sociis_ (3 _Term Reports_, 87), which proclaims the\r\n  importance of the context, still applies. So do the rules _Expressio\r\n  unius est exclusio alterius_ (Co. _Litt._ 210 a), and _Contemporanea\r\n  expositio est optima et fortissima in lege_ (2 Co. _Inst._ 11), which\r\n  lets in evidence of contemporaneous user as an aid to the\r\n  interpretation of statutes or documents; see _Van Diemen's Land Co._\r\n  v. _Table Cape Marine Board_, 1906, A.C. 92, 98. We may conclude this\r\n  sketch with a miscellaneous summary: _Caveat emptor_ (Hob. 99)--\"let\r\n  the purchaser beware\"; _Qui facit per alium facile per se_, which\r\n  affirms the principal's liability for the acts of his agent;\r\n  _Ignorantia juris neminem excusat_, on which rests the ordinary\r\n  citizen's obligation to know the law; and _Vigilantibus non\r\n  dormientibus jura subveniunt_ (2 Co. _Inst._ 690), one of the maxims\r\n  in accordance with which courts of equity administer relief. Among\r\n  other \"maxims of equity\" come the rules that \"he that seeks equity\r\n  must do equity,\" i.e. must act fairly, and that \"equity looks upon\r\n  that as done which ought to be done\"--a principle from which the\r\n  \"conversion\" into money of land directed to be sold, and of money\r\n  directed to be invested in the purchase of land, is derived.\r\n\r\n  The principal collections of legal maxims are: _English Law_: Bacon,\r\n  _Collection of Some Principal Rules and Maxims of the Common Law_\r\n  (1630); Noy, _Treatise of the principal Grounds and Maxims of the Law\r\n  of England_ (1641, 8th ed., 1824); Wingate, _Maxims of Reason_ (1728);\r\n  Francis, _Grounds and Rudiments of Law and Equity_ (2nd ed. 1751);\r\n  Lofft (annexed to his Reports, 1776); Broom, _Legal Maxims_ (7th ed.\r\n  London, 1900). _Scots Law_: Lord Trayner, _Latin Maxims and Phrases_\r\n  (2nd ed., 1876); Stair, _Institutions of the Law of Scotland_, with\r\n  Index by More (Edinburgh, 1832). _American Treatises_: A.

R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMUS, the name of four Roman emperors.\r\n\r\nI. M. CLODIUS PUPIENUS MAXIMUS, joint emperor with D. Caelius Calvinus\r\nBalbinus during a few months of the year A.D. 238. Pupienus was a\r\ndistinguished soldier, who had been proconsul of Bithynia, Achaea, and\r\nGallia Narbonensis. At the advanced age of seventy-four, he was chosen by\r\nthe senate with Balbinus to resist the barbarian Maximinus. Their complete\r\nequality is shown by the fact that each assumed the titles of pontifex\r\nmaximus and princeps senatus. It was arranged that Pupienus should take\r\nthe field against Maximinus, while Balbinus remained at Rome to maintain\r\norder, a task in which he signally failed. A revolt of the praetorians was\r\nnot repressed till much blood had been shed and a considerable part of the\r\ncity reduced to ashes. On his march, Pupienus, having received the news\r\nthat Maximinus had been assassinated by his own troops, returned in\r\ntriumph to Rome. Shortly afterwards, when both emperors were on the point\r\nof leaving the city on an expedition--Pupienus against the Persians and\r\nBalbinus against the Goths--the praetorians, who had always resented the\r\nappointment of the senatorial emperors and cherished the memory of the\r\nsoldier-emperor Maximinus, seized the opportunity of revenge. When most of\r\nthe people were at the Capitoline games, they forced their way into the\r\npalace, dragged Balbinus and Pupienus through the streets, and put them to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n  See Capitolinus, _Life of Maximus and Balbinus_; Herodian vii. 10,\r\n  viii. 6; Zonaras xii. 16; Orosius vii. 19; Eutropius ix. 2; Zosimus i.\r\n  14; Aurelius Victor, _Caesares_, 26, _epit._ 26; H.

MAGNUS MAXIMUS, a native of Spain, who had accompanied Theodosius on\r\nseveral expeditions and from 368 held high military rank in Britain. The\r\ndisaffected troops having proclaimed Maximus emperor, he crossed over\r\nto Gaul, attacked Gratian (q.v.), and drove him from Paris to Lyons,\r\nwhere he was murdered by a partisan of Maximus. Theodosius being unable\r\nto avenge the death of his colleague, an agreement was made (384 or 385)\r\nby which Maximus was recognized as Augustus and sole emperor in Gaul,\r\nSpain and Britain, while Valentinian II. was to remain unmolested in\r\nItaly and Illyricum, Theodosius retaining his sovereignty in the East.\r\nIn 387 Maximus crossed the Alps, Valentinian was speedily put to flight,\r\nwhile the invader established himself in Milan and for the time became\r\nmaster of Italy. Theodosius now took vigorous measures. Advancing with a\r\npowerful army, he twice defeated the troops of Maximus--at Siscia on the\r\nSave, and at Poetovio on the Danube. He then hurried on to Aquileia,\r\nwhere Maximus had shut himself up, and had him beheaded. Under the name\r\nof Maxen Wledig, Maximus appears in the list of Welsh royal heroes (see\r\nR. Williams, _Biog. Dict. of Eminent Welshmen_, 1852; \"The Dream of\r\nMaxen Wledig,\" in the _Mabinogion_).\r\n\r\n  Full account with classical references in H.

(1887); Gibbon, _Decline and Fall_, ch. 27;\r\n  Tillemont, _Hist. des empereurs_, v.\r\n\r\nIII. MAXIMUS TYRANNUS, made emperor in Spain by the Roman general,\r\nGerontius, who had rebelled against the usurper Constantine in 408.\r\nAfter the defeat of Gerontius at Arelate (Arles) and his death in 411\r\nMaximus renounced the imperial title and was permitted by Constantine to\r\nretire into private life. About 418 he rebelled again, but, failing in\r\nhis attempt, was seized, carried into Italy, and put to death at Ravenna\r\nin 422.\r\n\r\n  See Orosius vii. 42; Zosimus vi. 5; Sozomen ix. 3; E. A. Freeman, \"The\r\n  Tyrants of Britain, Gaul and Spain, A.D. 406-411,\" in _English\r\n  Historical Review_, i. (1886).\r\n\r\nIV. PETRONIUS MAXIMUS, a member of the higher Roman nobility, had held\r\nseveral court and public offices, including those of _praefectus Romae_\r\n(420) and _Italiae_ (439-441 and 445), and consul (433, 443). He was one\r\nof the intimate associates of Valentinian III., whom he assisted in the\r\npalace intrigues which led to the death of Aëtius in 454; but an outrage\r\ncommitted on the wife of Maximus by the emperor turned his friendship\r\ninto hatred. Maximus was proclaimed emperor immediately after\r\nValentinian's murder (March 16, 455), but after reigning less than three\r\nmonths, he was murdered by some Burgundian mercenaries as he was fleeing\r\nbefore the troops of Genseric, who, invited by Eudoxia, the widow of\r\nValentinian, had landed at the mouth of the Tiber (May or June 455).\r\n\r\n  See Procopius, _Vand._ i. 4; Sidonius Apollinaris, _Panegyr. Aviti_,\r\n  ep. ii. 13; the various _Chronicles_; Gibbon, _Decline and Fall_, chs.\r\n  35, 36; Tillemont, _Hist. des empereurs_, vi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMUS, ST (c. 580-662), abbot of Chrysopolis, known as \"the Confessor\"\r\nfrom his orthodox zeal in the Monothelite (q.v.) controversy, or as \"the\r\nmonk,\" was born of noble parentage at Constantinople about the year 580.\r\nEducated with great care, he early became distinguished by his talents\r\nand acquirements, and some time after the accession of the emperor\r\nHeraclius in 610 was made his private secretary. In 630 he abandoned the\r\nsecular life and entered the monastery of Chrysopolis (Scutari),\r\nactuated, it was believed, less by any longing for the life of a recluse\r\nthan by the dissatisfaction he felt with the Monothelite leanings of his\r\nmaster. The date of his promotion to the abbacy is uncertain. In 633 he\r\nwas one of the party of Sophronius of Jerusalem (the chief original\r\nopponent of the Monothelites) at the council of Alexandria; and in 645\r\nhe was again in Africa, when he held in presence of the governor and a\r\nnumber of bishops the disputation with Pyrrhus, the deposed and banished\r\npatriarch of Constantinople, which resulted in the (temporary)\r\nconversion of his interlocutor to the Dyothelite view. In the following\r\nyear several African synods, held under the influence of Maximus,\r\ndeclared for orthodoxy. In 649, after the accession of Martin I., he\r\nwent to Rome, and did much to fan the zeal of the new pope, who in\r\nOctober of that year held the (first) Lateran synod, by which not only\r\nthe Monothelite doctrine but also the moderating _ecthesis_ of Heraclius\r\nand _typus_ of Constans II. were anathematized. About 653 Maximus, for\r\nthe part he had taken against the latter document especially, was\r\napprehended (together with the pope) by order of Constans and carried a\r\nprisoner to Constantinople. In 655, after repeated examinations, in\r\nwhich he maintained his theological opinions with memorable constancy,\r\nhe was banished to Byzia in Thrace, and afterwards to Perberis. In 662\r\nhe was again brought to Constantinople and was condemned by a synod to\r\nbe scourged, to have his tongue cut out by the root, and to have his\r\nright hand chopped off. After this sentence had been carried out he was\r\nagain banished to Lazica, where he died on the 13th of August 662. He is\r\nvenerated as a saint both in the Greek and in the Latin Churches.\r\nMaximus was not only a leader in the Monothelite struggle but a mystic\r\nwho zealously followed and advocated the system of Pseudo-Dionysius,\r\nwhile adding to it an ethical element in the conception of the freedom\r\nof the will. His works had considerable influence in shaping the system\r\nof John Scotus Erigena.\r\n\r\n  The most important of the works of Maximus will be found in Migne,\r\n  _Patrologia graeca_, xc. xci., together with an anonymous life; an\r\n  exhaustive list in Wagenmann's article in vol. xii. (1903) of\r\n  Hauck-Herzog's _Realencyklopädie_ where the following classification\r\n  is adopted: (a) exegetical, (b) scholia on the Fathers, (c) dogmatic\r\n  and controversial, (d) ethical and ascetic, (e) miscellaneous. The\r\n  details of the disputation with Pyrrhus and of the martyrdom are given\r\n  very fully and clearly in Hefele's _Conciliengeschichte_, iii. For\r\n  further literature see H. Gelzer in C. Krumbacher's _Geschichte der\r\n  byzantinischen Litteratur_ (1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMUS OF SMYRNA, a Greek philosopher of the Neo-platonist school, who\r\nlived towards the end of the 4th century A.D. He was perhaps the most\r\nimportant of the followers of Iamblichus. He is said to have been of a\r\nrich and noble family, and exercised great influence over the emperor\r\nJulian, who was commended to him by Aedesius. He pandered to the\r\nemperor's love of magic and theurgy, and by judicious administration of\r\nthe omens won a high position at court. His overbearing manner made him\r\nnumerous enemies, and, after being imprisoned on the death of Julian, he\r\nwas put to death by Valens. He is a representative of the least\r\nattractive side of Neoplatonism. Attaching no value to logical proof and\r\nargument, he enlarged on the wonders and mysteries of nature, and\r\nmaintained his position by the working of miracles. In logic he is\r\nreported to have agreed with Eusebius, Iamblichus and Porphyry in\r\nasserting the validity of the second and third figures of the syllogism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMUS OF TYRE (CASSIUS MAXIMUS TYRIUS), a Greek rhetorician and\r\nphilosopher who flourished in the time of the Antonines and Commodus\r\n(2nd century A.D.). After the manner of the sophists of his age, he\r\ntravelled extensively, delivering lectures on the way. His writings\r\ncontain many allusions to the history of Greece, while there is little\r\nreference to Rome; hence it is inferred that he lived longer in Greece,\r\nperhaps as a professor at Athens. Although nominally a Platonist, he is\r\nreally an Eclectic and one of the precursors of Neoplatonism. There are\r\nstill extant by him forty-one essays or discourses ([Greek: dialexeis])\r\non theological, ethical, and other philosophical commonplaces. With him\r\nGod is the supreme being, one and indivisible though called by many\r\nnames, accessible to reason alone; but as animals form the intermediate\r\nstage between plants and human beings, so there exist intermediaries\r\nbetween God and man, viz. daemons, who dwell on the confines of heaven\r\nand earth. The soul in many ways bears a great resemblance to the\r\ndivinity; it is partly mortal, partly immortal, and, when freed from the\r\nfetters of the body, becomes a daemon. Life is the sleep of the soul,\r\nfrom which it awakes at death. The style of Maximus is superior to that\r\nof the ordinary sophistical rhetorician, but scholars differ widely as\r\nto the merits of the essays themselves.\r\n\r\nMaximus of Tyre must be distinguished from the Stoic Maximus, tutor of\r\nMarcus Aurelius.\r\n\r\n  Editions by J.

There is\r\n  an English translation (1804) by Thomas Taylor, the Platonist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAX MÜLLER, FRIEDRICH (1823-1900), Anglo-German orientalist and\r\ncomparative philologist, was born at Dessau on the 6th of December 1823,\r\nbeing the son of Wilhelm Müller (1794-1827), the German poet, celebrated\r\nfor his phil-Hellenic lyrics, who was ducal librarian at Dessau. The\r\nelder Müller had endeared himself to the most intellectual circles in\r\nGermany by his amiable character and his genuine poetic gift; his songs\r\nhad been utilized by musical composers, notably Schubert; and it was his\r\nson's good fortune to meet in his youth with a succession of eminent\r\nfriends, who, already interested in him for his father's sake, and\r\ncharmed by the qualities which they discovered in the young man himself,\r\npowerfully aided him by advice and patronage. Mendelssohn, who was his\r\ngodfather, dissuaded him from indulging his natural bent to the study of\r\nmusic; Professor Brockhaus of the University of Leipzig, where Max\r\nMüller matriculated in 1841, induced him to take up Sanskrit; Bopp, at\r\nthe University of Berlin (1844), made the Sanskrit student a scientific\r\ncomparative philologist; Schelling at the same university, inspired him\r\nwith a love for metaphysical speculation, though failing to attract him\r\nto his own philosophy; Burnouf, at Paris in the following year, by\r\nteaching him Zend, started him on the track of inquiry into the science\r\nof comparative religion, and impelled him to edit the _Rig Veda_; and\r\nwhen, in 1846, Max Müller came to England upon this errand, Bunsen, in\r\nconjunction with Professor H. H. Wilson, prevailed upon the East India\r\nCompany to undertake the expense of publication. Up to this time Max\r\nMüller had lived the life of a poor student, supporting himself partly\r\nby copying manuscripts, but Bunsen's introductions to Queen Victoria and\r\nthe prince consort, and to Oxford University, laid the foundation for\r\nhim of fame and fortune. In 1848 the printing of his _Rig Veda_ at the\r\nUniversity Press obliged him to settle in Oxford, a step which decided\r\nhis future career. He arrived at a favourable conjuncture: the\r\nTractarian strife, which had so long thrust learning into the\r\nbackground, was just over, and Oxford was becoming accessible to modern\r\nideas. The young German excited curiosity and interest, and it was soon\r\ndiscovered that, although a genuine scholar, he was no mere bookworm.\r\nPart of his social success was due to his readiness to exert his musical\r\ntalents at private parties. Max Müller was speedily subjugated by the\r\n_genius loci_. He was appointed deputy Taylorian professor of modern\r\nlanguages in 1850, and the German government failed to tempt him back to\r\nStrassburg. In the following year he was made M.A. and honorary fellow\r\nof Christ Church, and in 1858 he was elected a fellow of All Souls. In\r\n1854 the Crimean War gave him the opportunity of utilizing his oriental\r\nlearning in vocabularies and schemes of transliteration. In 1857 he\r\nsuccessfully essayed another kind of literature in his beautiful story\r\n_Deutsche Liebe_, written both in German and English. He had by this\r\ntime become an extensive contributor to English periodical literature,\r\nand had written several of the essays subsequently collected as _Chips\r\nfrom a German Workshop_. The most important of them was the fascinating\r\nessay on \"Comparative Mythology\" in the _Oxford Essays_ for 1856. His\r\nvaluable _History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature_, so far as it\r\nillustrates the primitive religion of the Brahmans (and hence the Vedic\r\nperiod only), was published in 1850.\r\n\r\nThough Max Müller's reputation was that of a comparative philologist and\r\norientalist, his professional duties at Oxford were long confined to\r\nlecturing on modern languages, or at least their medieval forms. In 1860\r\nthe death of Horace Hayman Wilson, professor of Sanskrit, seemed to open\r\na more congenial sphere to him. His claims to the succession seemed\r\nincontestable, for his opponent, Monier Williams, though well qualified\r\nas a Sanskritist, lacked Max Müller's brilliant versatility, and\r\nalthough educated at Oxford, had held no University office. But Max\r\nMüller was a Liberal, and the friend of Liberals in university matters,\r\nin politics, and in theology, and this consideration united with his\r\nforeign birth to bring the country clergy in such hosts to the poll that\r\nthe voice of resident Oxford was overborne, and Monier Williams was\r\nelected by a large majority. It was the one great disappointment of Max\r\nMüller's life, and made a lasting impression upon him. It was,\r\nnevertheless, serviceable to his influence and reputation by permitting\r\nhim to enter upon a wider field of subjects than would have been\r\npossible otherwise. Directly, Sanskrit philology received little more\r\nfrom him, except in connexion with his later undertaking of _The Sacred\r\nBooks of the East_; but indirectly he exalted it more than any\r\npredecessor by proclaiming its commanding position in the history of the\r\nhuman intellect by his _Science of Language_, two courses of lectures\r\ndelivered at the Royal Institution in 1861 and 1863. Max Müller ought\r\nnot to be described as \"the introducer of comparative philology into\r\nEngland.\" Prichard had proved the Aryan affinities of the Celtic\r\nlanguages by the methods of comparative philology so long before as\r\n1831; Winning's _Manual of Comparative Philology_ had been published in\r\n1838; the discoveries of Bopp and Pott and Pictet had been recognized in\r\nbrilliant articles in the _Quarterly Review_, and had guided the\r\nresearches of Rawlinson. But Max Müller undoubtedly did far more to\r\npopularize the subject than had been done, or could have been done, by\r\nany predecessor. He was on less sure ground in another department of the\r\nstudy of language--the problem of its origin. He wrote upon it as a\r\ndisciple of Kant, whose _Critique of Pure Reason_ he translated. His\r\nessays on mythology are among the most delightful of his writings, but\r\ntheir value is somewhat impaired by a too uncompromising adherence to\r\nthe seductive generalization of the solar myth.\r\n\r\nMax Müller's studies in mythology led him to another field of activity\r\nin which his influence was more durable and extensive, that of the\r\ncomparative science of religions. Here, so far as Great Britain is\r\nconcerned, he does deserve the fame of an originator, and his\r\n_Introduction to the Science of Religion_ (1873: the same year in which\r\nhe lectured on the subject, at Dean Stanley's invitation, in Westminster\r\nAbbey, this being the only occasion on which a layman had given an\r\naddress there) marks an epoch. It was followed by other works of\r\nimportance, especially the four volumes of Gifford lectures, delivered\r\nbetween 1888 and 1892; but the most tangible result of the impulse he\r\nhad given was the publication under his editorship, from 1875 onwards,\r\nof _The Sacred Books of the East_, in fifty-one volumes, including\r\nindexes, all but three of which appeared under his superintendence\r\nduring his lifetime. These comprise translations by the most competent\r\nscholars of all the really important non-Christian scriptures of\r\nOriental nations, which can now be appreciated without a knowledge of\r\nthe original languages. Max Müller also wrote on Indian philosophy in\r\nhis latter years, and his exertions to stimulate search for Oriental\r\nmanuscripts and inscriptions were rewarded with important discoveries of\r\nearly Buddhist scriptures, in their Indian form, made in Japan. He was\r\non particularly friendly terms with native Japanese scholars, and after\r\nhis death his library was purchased by the university of Tôkyô.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Max Müller had been indemnified for his disappointment over the\r\nSanskrit professorship by the establishment of a chair of Comparative\r\nPhilology to be filled by him. He retired, however, from the actual\r\nduties of the post in 1875, when entering upon the editorship of _The\r\nSacred Books of the East_. The most remarkable external events of his\r\nlatter years were his delivery of lectures at the restored university of\r\nStrassburg in 1872, when he devoted his honorarium to the endowment of a\r\nSanskrit lectureship, and his presidency over the International Congress\r\nof Orientalists in 1892. But his days, if uneventful, were busy. He\r\nparticipated in every movement at Oxford of which he could approve, and\r\nwas intimate with nearly all its men of light and leading; he was a\r\ncurator of the Bodleian Library, and a delegate of the University Press.\r\nHe was acquainted with most of the crowned heads\r\n\r\nof Europe, and was an especial favourite with the English royal family.\r\nHis hospitality was ample, especially to visitors from India, where he\r\nwas far better known than any other European Orientalist. His\r\ndistinctions, conferred by foreign governments and learned societies,\r\nwere innumerable, and, having been naturalized shortly after his arrival\r\nin England, he received the high honour of being made a privy\r\ncouncillor. In 1898 and 1899 he published autobiographical reminiscences\r\nunder the title of _Auld Lang Syne_. He was writing a more detailed\r\nautobiography when overtaken by death on the 28th of October 1900. Max\r\nMüller married in 1859 Georgiana Adelaide Grenfell, sister of the wives\r\nof Charles Kingsley and J. A. Froude. One of his daughters, Mrs\r\nConybeare, distinguished herself by a translation of Scherer's _History\r\nof German Literature_.\r\n\r\nThough undoubtedly a great scholar, Max Müller did not so much represent\r\nscholarship pure and simple as her hybrid types--the scholar-author and\r\nthe scholar-courtier. In the former capacity, though manifesting little\r\nof the originality of genius, he rendered vast service by popularizing\r\nhigh truths among high minds. In his public and social character he\r\nrepresented Oriental studies with a brilliancy, and conferred upon them\r\na distinction, which they had not previously enjoyed in Great Britain.\r\nThere were drawbacks in both respects: the author was too prone to build\r\nupon insecure foundations, and the man of the world incurred censure for\r\nfailings which may perhaps be best indicated by the remark that he\r\nseemed too much of a diplomatist. But the sum of foibles seems\r\ninsignificant in comparison with the life of intense labour dedicated to\r\nthe service of culture and humanity.\r\n\r\n  Max Müller's _Collected Works_ were published in 1903.     (R. G.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXWELL, the name of a Scottish family, members of which have held the\r\ntitles of earl of Morton, earl of Nithsdale, Lord Maxwell, and Lord\r\nHerries. The name is taken probably from Maccuswell, or Maxwell, near\r\nKelso, whither the family migrated from England about 1100. Sir Herbert\r\nMaxwell won great fame by defending his castle of Carlaverock against\r\nEdward I. in 1300; another Sir Herbert was made a lord of the Scottish\r\nparliament before 1445; and his great-grandson John, 3rd Lord Maxwell,\r\nwas killed at Flodden in 1513. John's son Robert, the 4th lord (d.\r\n1546), was a member of the royal council under James V.; he was also an\r\nextraordinary lord of session, high admiral, and warden of the west\r\nmarches, and was taken prisoner by the English at the rout of Solway\r\nMoss in 1542. Robert's grandson John, 7th Lord Maxwell (1553-1593), was\r\nthe second son of Robert, the 5th lord (d. 1552), and his wife Beatrix,\r\ndaughter of James Douglas, 3rd earl of Morton. After the execution of\r\nthe regent Morton, the 4th earl, in 1581 this earldom was bestowed upon\r\nMaxwell, but in 1586 the attainder of the late earl was reversed and he\r\nwas deprived of his new title. He had helped in 1585 to drive the royal\r\nfavourite James Stewart, earl of Arran, from power, and he made active\r\npreparations to assist the invading Spaniards in 1588. His son John, the\r\n8th lord (c. 1586-1613), was at feud with the Johnstones, who had killed\r\nhis father in a skirmish, and with the Douglases over the earldom of\r\nMorton, which he regarded as his inheritance. After a life of\r\nexceptional and continuous lawlessness he escaped from Scotland and in\r\nhis absence was sentenced to death; having returned to his native\r\ncountry he was seized and was beheaded in Edinburgh. In 1618 John's\r\nbrother and heir Robert (d. 1646) was restored to the lordship of\r\nMaxwell, and in 1620 was created earl of Nithsdale, surrendering at this\r\ntime his claim to the earldom of Morton. He and his son Robert,\r\nafterwards the 2nd earl, fought under Montrose for Charles I. during the\r\nCivil War. Robert died without sons in October 1667, when a cousin John\r\nMaxwell, 7th Lord Herries (d. 1677), became third earl.\r\n\r\nWilliam, 5th earl of Nithsdale (1676-1744), a grandson of the third\r\nearl, was like his ancestor a Roman Catholic and was attached to the\r\ncause of the exiled house of Stuart. In 1715 he joined the Jacobite\r\ninsurgents, being taken prisoner at the battle of Preston and sentenced\r\nto death. He escaped, however, from the Tower of London through the\r\ncourage and devotion of his wife Winifred (d. 1749), daughter of William\r\nHerbert, 1st marquess of Powis. He was attainted in 1716 and his titles\r\nbecame extinct, but his estates passed to his son William (d. 1776),\r\nwhose descendant, William Constable-Maxwell, regained the title of Lord\r\nHerries in 1858. The countess of Nithsdale wrote an account of her\r\nhusband's escape, which is published in vol. i. of the _Transactions of\r\nthe Society of Antiquaries of Scotland_.\r\n\r\n  A few words may be added about other prominent members of the Maxwell\r\n  family. John Maxwell (c. 1590-1647), archbishop of Tuam, was a\r\n  Scottish ecclesiastic who took a leading part in helping Archbishop\r\n  Laud in his futile attempt to restore the liturgy in Scotland. He was\r\n  bishop of Ross from 1633 until 1638, when he was deposed by the\r\n  General Assembly; then crossing over to Ireland he was bishop of\r\n  Killala and Achonry from 1640 to 1645, and archbishop of Tuam from\r\n  1645 until his death. James Maxwell of Kirkconnell (c. 1708-1762), the\r\n  Jacobite, wrote the _Narrative of Charles Prince of Wales's Expedition\r\n  to Scotland in 1745_, which was printed for the Maitland Club in 1841.\r\n  Robert Maxwell (1695-1765) was the author of _Select Transactions of\r\n  the Society of Improvers_ and was a great benefactor to Scottish\r\n  agriculture. Sir Murray Maxwell (1775-1831), a naval officer, gained\r\n  much fame by his conduct when his ship the \"Alceste\" was wrecked in\r\n  Gaspar Strait in 1817. William Hamilton Maxwell (1792-1850), the Irish\r\n  novelist, wrote, in addition to several novels, a _Life of the Duke of\r\n  Wellington_ (1839-1841 and again 1883), and a _History of the Irish\r\n  Rebellion in 1798_ (1845 and 1891). Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th bart. (b.\r\n  1845), member of parliament for Wigtownshire from 1880 to 1906, and\r\n  president of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, became well known\r\n  as a writer, his works including _Life and Times of the Right Hon. W.\r\n  H. Smith_ (1893); _Life of the Duke of Wellington_ (1899); _The House\r\n  of Douglas_ (1902); _Robert the Bruce_ (1897) and _A Duke of Britain_\r\n  (1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXWELL, JAMES CLERK (1831-1879), British physicist, was the last\r\nrepresentative of a younger branch of the well-known Scottish family of\r\nClerk of Penicuik, and was born at Edinburgh on the 13th of November\r\n1831. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy (1840-1847) and the\r\nuniversity of Edinburgh (1847-1850). Entering at Cambridge in 1850, he\r\nspent a term or two at Peterhouse, but afterwards migrated to Trinity.\r\nIn 1854 he took his degree as second wrangler, and was declared equal\r\nwith the senior wrangler of his year (E. J. Routh, q.v.) in the higher\r\nordeal of the Smith's prize examination. He held the chair of Natural\r\nPhilosophy in Marischal College, Aberdeen, from 1856 till the fusion of\r\nthe two colleges there in 1860. For eight years subsequently he held the\r\nchair of Physics and Astronomy in King's College, London, but resigned\r\nin 1868 and retired to his estate of Glenlair in Kirkcudbrightshire. He\r\nwas summoned from his seclusion in 1871 to become the first holder of\r\nthe newly founded professorship of Experimental Physics in Cambridge;\r\nand it was under his direction that the plans of the Cavendish\r\nLaboratory were prepared. He superintended every step of the progress of\r\nthe building and of the purchase of the very valuable collection of\r\napparatus with which it was equipped at the expense of its munificent\r\nfounder the seventh duke of Devonshire (chancellor of the university,\r\nand one of its most distinguished alumni). He died at Cambridge on the\r\n5th of November 1879.\r\n\r\nFor more than half of his brief life he held a prominent position in the\r\nvery foremost rank of natural philosophers. His contributions to\r\nscientific societies began in his fifteenth year, when Professor J. D.\r\nForbes communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh a short paper of\r\nhis on a mechanical method of tracing Cartesian ovals. In his eighteenth\r\nyear, while still a student in Edinburgh, he contributed two valuable\r\npapers to the _Transactions_ of the same society--one of which, \"On the\r\nEquilibrium of Elastic Solids,\" is remarkable, not only on account of\r\nits intrinsic power and the youth of its author, but also because in it\r\nhe laid the foundation of one of the most singular discoveries of his\r\nlater life, the temporary double refraction produced in viscous liquids\r\nby shearing stress. Immediately after taking his degree, he read to the\r\nCambridge Philosophical Society a very novel memoir, \"On the\r\nTransformation of Surfaces by Bending.\" This is one of the few purely\r\nmathematical papers he published, and it exhibited at once to experts\r\nthe full genius of its author. About the same time appeared his\r\nelaborate memoir, \"On Faraday's Lines of Force,\" in which he gave the\r\nfirst indication of some of those extraordinary electrical\r\ninvestigations which culminated in the greatest work of his life. He\r\nobtained in 1859 the Adams prize in Cambridge for a very original and\r\npowerful essay, \"On the Stability of Saturn's Rings.\" From 1855 to 1872\r\nhe published at intervals a series of valuable investigations connected\r\nwith the \"Perception of Colour\" and \"Colour-Blindness,\" for the earlier\r\nof which he received the Rumford medal from the Royal Society in 1860.\r\nThe instruments which he devised for these investigations were simple\r\nand convenient, but could not have been thought of for the purpose\r\nexcept by a man whose knowledge was co-extensive with his ingenuity. One\r\nof his greatest investigations bore on the \"Kinetic Theory of Gases.\"\r\nOriginating with D. Bernoulli, this theory was advanced by the\r\nsuccessive labours of John Herapath, J. P. Joule, and particularly R.\r\nClausius, to such an extent as to put its general accuracy beyond a\r\ndoubt; but it received enormous developments from Maxwell, who in this\r\nfield appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as\r\nwell as a mathematician. He wrote an admirable textbook of the _Theory\r\nof Heat_ (1871), and a very excellent elementary treatise on _Matter and\r\nMotion_ (1876).\r\n\r\nBut the great work of his life was devoted to electricity. He began by\r\nreading, with the most profound admiration and attention, the whole of\r\nFaraday's extraordinary self-revelations, and proceeded to translate the\r\nideas of that master into the succinct and expressive notation of the\r\nmathematicians. A considerable part of this translation was accomplished\r\nduring his career as an undergraduate in Cambridge. The writer had the\r\nopportunity of perusing the MS. of \"On Faraday's Lines of Force,\" in a\r\nform little different from the final one, a year before Maxwell took his\r\ndegree. His great object, as it was also the great object of Faraday,\r\nwas to overturn the idea of action at a distance. The splendid\r\nresearches of S. D. Poisson and K. F. Gauss had shown how to reduce all\r\nthe phenomena of statical electricity to mere attractions and repulsions\r\nexerted at a distance by particles of an imponderable on one another.\r\nLord Kelvin (Sir W. Thomson) had, in 1846, shown that a totally\r\ndifferent assumption, based upon other analogies, led (by its own\r\nspecial mathematical methods) to precisely the same results. He treated\r\nthe resultant electric force at any point as analogous to the _flux of\r\nheat_ from sources distributed in the same manner as the supposed\r\nelectric particles. This paper of Thomson's, whose ideas Maxwell\r\nafterwards developed in an extraordinary manner, seems to have given the\r\nfirst hint that there are at least two perfectly distinct methods of\r\narriving at the known formulae of statical electricity. The step to\r\nmagnetic phenomena was comparatively simple; but it was otherwise as\r\nregards electro-magnetic phenomena, where current electricity is\r\nessentially involved. An exceedingly ingenious, but highly artificial,\r\ntheory had been devised by W. E. Weber, which was found capable of\r\nexplaining all the phenomena investigated by Ampère as well as the\r\ninduction currents of Faraday. But this was based upon the assumption of\r\na distance-action between electric particles, the intensity of which\r\ndepended on their relative motion as well as on their position. This\r\nwas, of course, even more repugnant to Maxwell's mind than the statical\r\ndistance-action developed by Poisson. The first paper of Maxwell's in\r\nwhich an attempt at an admissible physical theory of electromagnetism\r\nwas made was communicated to the Royal Society in 1867. But the theory,\r\nin a fully developed form, first appeared in 1873 in his great treatise\r\non _Electricity and Magnetism_. This work was one of the most splendid\r\nmonuments ever raised by the genius of a single individual. Availing\r\nhimself of the admirable generalized co-ordinate system of Lagrange,\r\nMaxwell showed how to reduce all electric and magnetic phenomena to\r\nstresses and motions of a material medium, and, as one preliminary, but\r\nexcessively severe, test of the truth of his theory, he pointed out that\r\n(if the electro-magnetic medium be that which is required for the\r\nexplanation of the phenomena of light) the velocity of light in vacuo\r\nshould be numerically the same as the ratio of the electro-magnetic and\r\nelectrostatic units. In fact, the means of the best determinations of\r\neach of these quantities separately agree with one another more closely\r\nthan do the various values of either.\r\n\r\nOne of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing\r\n(with copious original notes) of the _Electrical Researches of the Hon.\r\nHenry Cavendish_, from which it appeared that Cavendish, already famous\r\nby many other researches (such as the mean density of the earth, the\r\ncomposition of water, &c.), must be looked on as, in his day, a man of\r\nMaxwell's own stamp as a theorist and an experimenter of the very first\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nIn private life Clerk Maxwell was one of the most lovable of men, a\r\nsincere and unostentatious Christian. Though perfectly free from any\r\ntrace of envy or ill-will, he yet showed on fit occasion his contempt\r\nfor that pseudo-science which seeks for the applause of the ignorant by\r\nprofessing to reduce the whole system of the universe to a fortuitous\r\nsequence of uncaused events.\r\n\r\n  His collected works, including the series of articles on the\r\n  properties of matter, such as \"Atom,\" \"Attraction,\" \"Capillary\r\n  Action,\" \"Diffusion,\" \"Ether,\" &c., which he contributed to the 9th\r\n  edition of this encyclopaedia, were issued in two volumes by the\r\n  Cambridge University Press in 1890; and an extended biography, by his\r\n  former schoolfellow and lifelong friend Professor Lewis Campbell, was\r\n  published in 1882.     (P. G. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXWELLTOWN, a burgh of barony and police burgh of Kirkcudbrightshire,\r\nScotland. Pop. (1901), 5796. It lies on the Nith, opposite to Dumfries,\r\nwith which it is connected by three bridges, being united with it for\r\nparliamentary purposes. It has a station on the Glasgow & South-Western\r\nline from Dumfries to Kirkcudbright. Its public buildings include a\r\ncourt-house, the prison for the south-west of Scotland, and an\r\nobservatory and museum, housed in a disused windmill. The chief\r\nmanufactures are woollens and hosiery, besides dyeworks and sawmills. It\r\nwas a hamlet known as Bridgend up till 1810, in which year it was\r\nerected into a burgh of barony under its present name. To the north-west\r\nlies the parish of Terregles, said to be a corruption of Tir-eglwys\r\n(_terra ecclesia_, that is, \"Kirk land\"). The parish contains the\r\nbeautiful ruin of Lincluden Abbey (see DUMFRIES), and Terregles House,\r\nonce the seat of William Maxwell, last earl of Nithsdale. In the parish\r\nof Lochrutton, a few miles south-west of Maxwelltown, there is a good\r\nexample of a stone circle, the \"Seven Grey Sisters,\" and an old\r\npeel-tower in the Mains of Hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY, PHIL (1864-1903), English caricaturist, was born at Wortley, near\r\nLeeds, on the 22nd of April 1864, the son of an engineer. His father\r\ndied when the child was nine years old, and at twelve he had begun to\r\nearn his living. Before he was fifteen he had acted as time-keeper at a\r\nfoundry, had tried to become a jockey, and had been on the stage at\r\nScarborough and Leeds. When he was about seventeen he went to London\r\nwith a sovereign in his pocket. He suffered extreme want, sleeping out\r\nin the parks and streets, until he obtained employment as designer to a\r\ntheatrical costumier. He also drew posters and cartoons, and for about\r\ntwo years worked for the _St Stephen's Review_, until he was advised to\r\ngo to Australia for his health. During the three years he spent there he\r\nwas attached to the _Sydney Bulletin_, for which many of his best\r\ndrawings were made. On his return to Europe he went to Paris by way of\r\nRome, where he worked hard for some time before he appeared in 1892 in\r\nLondon to resume his interrupted connexion with the _St Stephen's\r\nReview_. His studies of the London \"guttersnipe\" and the coster-girl\r\nrapidly made him famous. His overflowing sense of fun, his genuine\r\nsympathy with his subjects, and his kindly wit were on a par with his\r\nartistic ability. It was often said that the extraordinary economy of\r\nline which was a characteristic feature of his drawings had been forced\r\nupon him by the deficiencies of the printing machines of the _Sydney\r\nBulletin_. It was in fact the result of a laborious process which\r\ninvolved a number of preliminary sketches, and of a carefully considered\r\nsystem of elimination. His later work included some excellent political\r\nportraits. He became a regular member of the staff of _Punch_ in 1896,\r\nand in his later years his services were retained exclusively for\r\n_Punch_ and the _Graphic_. He died on the 5th of August 1903.\r\n\r\n  There was an exhibition of his drawings at the Fine Arts Society in\r\n  1895, and another at the Leicester Galleries in 1903. A selection of\r\n  his drawings contributed to the periodical press and from _Phil May's\r\n  Annual_ and _Phil May's Sketch Books_, with a portrait and biography\r\n  of the artist, entitled _The Phil May Folio_, appeared in 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY, THOMAS (1595-1650), English poet and historian, son of Sir Thomas\r\nMay of Mayfield, Sussex, was born in 1595. He entered Sidney Sussex\r\nCollege, Cambridge, in 1609, and took his B.A. degree three years later.\r\nHis father having lost his fortune and sold the family estate, Thomas\r\nMay, who was hampered by an impediment in his speech, made literature\r\nhis profession. In 1620 he produced _The Heir_, an ingeniously\r\nconstructed comedy, and, probably about the same time, _The Old Couple_,\r\nwhich was not printed until 1658. His other dramatic works are classical\r\ntragedies on the subjects of Antigone, Cleopatra, and Agrippina. F. G.\r\nFleay has suggested that the more famous anonymous tragedy of _Nero_\r\n(printed 1624, reprints in A. H. Bullen's _Old English Plays_ and the\r\n_Mermaid Series_) should also be assigned to May. But his most important\r\nwork in the department of pure literature was his translation (1627)\r\ninto heroic couplets of the _Pharsalia_ of Lucan. Its success led May to\r\nwrite a continuation of Lucan's narrative down to the death of Caesar.\r\nCharles I. became his patron, and commanded him to write metrical\r\nhistories of Henry II. and Edward III., which were completed in 1635.\r\nWhen the earl of Pembroke, then lord chamberlain, broke his staff across\r\nMay's shoulders at a masque, the king took him under his protection as\r\n\"my poet,\" and Pembroke made him an apology accompanied with a gift of\r\n£50. These marks of the royal favour seem to have led May to expect the\r\nposts of poet-laureate and city chronologer when they fell vacant on the\r\ndeath of Ben Jonson in 1637, but he was disappointed, and he forsook the\r\ncourt and attached himself to the party of the Parliament. In 1646 he is\r\nstyled one of the \"secretaries\" of the Parliament, and in 1647 he\r\npublished his best known work, _The History of the Long Parliament_. In\r\nthis official apology for the moderate or Presbyterian party, he\r\nprofesses to give an impartial statement of facts, unaccompanied by any\r\nexpression of party or personal opinion. If he refrained from actual\r\ninvective, he accomplished his purpose, according to Guizot, by\r\n\"omission, palliation and dissimulation.\" Accusations of this kind were\r\nforeseen by May, who says in his preface that if he gives more\r\ninformation about the Parliament men than their opponents it is that he\r\nwas more conversant with them and their affairs. In 1650 he followed\r\nthis with another work written with a more definite bias, a _Breviary of\r\nthe History of the Parliament of England_, in Latin and English, in\r\nwhich he defended the position of the Independents. He stopped short of\r\nthe catastrophe of the king's execution, and it seems likely that his\r\nsubservience to Cromwell was not quite voluntary. In February 1650 he\r\nwas brought to London from Weymouth under a strong guard for having\r\nspread false reports of the Parliament and of Cromwell. He died on the\r\n13th of November in the same year, and was buried in Westminster Abbey,\r\nbut after the Restoration his remains were exhumed and buried in a pit\r\nin the yard of St Margaret's, Westminster. May's change of side made him\r\nmany bitter enemies, and he is the object of scathing condemnation from\r\nmany of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n  There is a long notice of May in the _Biographia Britannica_. See also\r\n  W. J. Courthope, _Hist. of Eng. Poetry_, vol. 3; and Guizot, _Études\r\n  biographiques sur la révolution d'Angleterre_ (pp. 403-426, ed. 1851).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY, or MEY(E), WILLIAM (d. 1560), English divine, was the brother of\r\nJohn May, bishop of Carlisle. He was educated at Cambridge, where he was\r\na fellow of Trinity Hall, and in 1537, president of Queen's College. May\r\nheartily supported the Reformation, signed the Ten Articles in 1536, and\r\nhelped in the production of _The Institution of a Christian Man_. He had\r\nclose connexion with the diocese of Ely, being successively chancellor,\r\nvicar-general and prebendary. In 1545 he was made a prebendary of St\r\nPaul's, and in the following year dean. His favourable report on the\r\nCambridge colleges saved them from dissolution. He was dispossessed\r\nduring the reign of Mary, but restored to the deanery on Elizabeth's\r\naccession. He died on the day of his election to the archbishopric of\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY, the fifth month of our modern year, the third of the old Roman\r\ncalendar. The origin of the name is disputed; the derivation from Maia,\r\nthe mother of Mercury, to whom the Romans were accustomed to sacrifice\r\non the first day of this month, is usually accepted. The ancient Romans\r\nused on May Day to go in procession to the grotto of Egeria. From the\r\n28th of April to the 2nd of May was kept the festival in honour of\r\nFlora, goddess of flowers. By the Romans the month was regarded as\r\nunlucky for marriages, owing to the celebration on the 9th, 11th and\r\n13th of the Lemuria, the festival of the unhappy dead. This superstition\r\nhas survived to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn medieval and Tudor England, May Day was a great public holiday. All\r\nclasses of the people, young and old alike, were up with the dawn, and\r\nwent \"a-Maying\" in the woods. Branches of trees and flowers were borne\r\nback in triumph to the towns and villages, the centre of the procession\r\nbeing occupied by those who shouldered the maypole, glorious with\r\nribbons and wreaths. The maypole was usually of birch, and set up for\r\nthe day only; but in London and the larger towns the poles were of\r\ndurable wood and permanently erected. They were special eyesores to the\r\nPuritans. John Stubbes in his _Anatomy of Abuses_ (1583) speaks of them\r\nas those \"stinckyng idols,\" about which the people \"leape and daunce, as\r\nthe heathen did.\" Maypoles were forbidden by the parliament in 1644, but\r\ncame once more into favour at the Restoration, the last to be erected in\r\nLondon being that set up in 1661. This pole, which was of cedar, 134 ft.\r\nhigh, was set up by twelve British sailors under the personal\r\nsupervision of James II., then duke of York and lord high admiral, in\r\nthe Strand on or about the site of the present church of St\r\nMary's-in-the-Strand. Taken down in 1717, it was conveyed to Wanstead\r\nPark in Essex, where it was fixed by Sir Isaac Newton as part of the\r\nsupport of a large telescope, presented to the Royal Society by a French\r\nastronomer.\r\n\r\n  For an account of the May Day survivals in rural England see P. H.\r\n  Ditchfield, _Old English Customs extant at Present Times_ (1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY, ISLE OF, an island belonging to Fifeshire, Scotland, at the\r\nentrance to the Firth of Forth, 5 m. S.E. of Crail and Anstruther. It\r\nhas a N.W. to S.E. trend, is more than 1 m. long, and measures at its\r\nwidest about 1/3 m. St Adrian, who had settled here, was martyred by the\r\nDanes about the middle of the 9th century. The ruins of the small chapel\r\ndedicated to him, which was a favourite place of pilgrimage, still\r\nexist. The place where the pilgrims--of whom James IV. was often\r\none--landed is yet known as Pilgrims' Haven, and traces may yet be seen\r\nof the various wells of St Andrew, St John, Our Lady, and the Pilgrims,\r\nthough their waters have become brackish. In 1499 Sir Andrew Wood of\r\nLargo, with the \"Yellow Carvel\" and \"Mayflower,\" captured the English\r\nseaman Stephen Bull, and three ships, after a fierce fight which took\r\nplace between the island and the Bass Rock. In 1636 a coal beacon was\r\nlighted on the May and maintained by Alexander Cunningham of Barns. The\r\noil light substituted for it in 1816 was replaced in 1888 by an electric\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYA, an important tribe and stock of American Indians, the dominant\r\nrace of Yucatan and other states of Mexico and part of Central America\r\nat the time of the Spanish conquest. They were then divided into many\r\nnations, chief among them being the Maya proper, the Huastecs, the\r\nTzental, the Pokom, the Mame and the Cakchiquel and Quiché. They were\r\nspread over Yucatan, Vera Cruz, Tabasco, Campeche, and Chiapas in\r\nMexico, and over the greater part of Guatemala and Salvador. In\r\ncivilization the Mayan peoples rivalled the Aztecs. Their traditions\r\ngive as their place of origin the extreme north; thence a migration took\r\nplace, perhaps at the beginning of the Christian era. They appear to\r\nhave reached Yucatan as early as the 5th century. From the evidence of\r\nthe Quiché chronicles, which are said to date back to about A.D. 700,\r\nGuatemala was shortly afterwards overrun. Physically the Mayans are a\r\ndark-skinned, round-headed, short and sturdy type. Although they were\r\nalready decadent when the Spaniards arrived they made a fierce\r\nresistance. They still form the bulk of the inhabitants of Yucatan. For\r\ntheir culture, ruined cities, &c. see CENTRAL AMERICA and MEXICO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYAGUEZ, the third largest city of Porto Rico, a seaport, and the seat\r\nof government of the department of Mayaguez, on the west coast, at the\r\nmouth of Rio Yaguez, about 72 m. W. by S. of San Juan. Pop. of the city\r\n(1899), 15,187, including 1381 negroes and 4711 of mixed races; (1910),\r\n16,591; of the municipal district, 35,700 (1899), of whom 2687 were\r\nnegroes and 9933 were of mixed races. Mayaguez is connected by the\r\nAmerican railroad of Porto Rico with San Juan and Ponce, and it is\r\nserved regularly by steamboats from San Juan, Ponce and New York,\r\nalthough its harbour is not accessible to vessels drawing more than 16\r\nft. of water. It is situated at the foot of Las Mesas mountains and\r\ncommands picturesque views. The climate is healthy and good water is\r\nobtained from the mountain region. From the shipping district along the\r\nwater-front a thoroughfare leads to the main portion of the city, about\r\n1 m. distant. There are four public squares, in one of which is a statue\r\nof Columbus. Prominent among the public buildings are the City Hall\r\n(containing a public library), San Antonio Hospital, Roman Catholic\r\nchurches, a Presbyterian church, the court-house and a theatre. The\r\nUnited States has an agricultural experiment station here, and the\r\nInsular Reform School is 1 m. south of the city. Coffee, sugar-cane and\r\ntropical fruits are grown in the surrounding country; and the business\r\nof the city consists chiefly in their export and the import of flour.\r\nAmong the manufactures are sugar, tobacco and chocolate. Mayaguez was\r\nfounded about the middle of the 18th century on the site of a hamlet\r\nwhich was first settled about 1680. It was incorporated as a town in\r\n1836, and became a city in 1873. In 1841 it was nearly all destroyed by\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYAVARAM, a town of British India, in the Tanjore district of Madras,\r\non the Cauvery river; junction on the South Indian railway, 174 m. S.W.\r\nof Madras. Pop. (1901), 24,276. It possesses a speciality of fine cotton\r\nand silk cloth, known as Kornad from the suburb in which the weavers\r\nlive. During October and November the town is the scene of a great\r\npilgrimage to the holy waters of the Cauvery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYBOLE, a burgh of barony and police burgh of Ayrshire, Scotland. Pop.\r\n(1901), 5892. It is situated 9 m. S. of Ayr and 50¼ m. S.W. of Glasgow\r\nby the Glasgow & South-Western railway. It is an ancient place, having\r\nreceived a charter from Duncan II. in 1193. In 1516 it was made a burgh\r\nof regality, but for generations it remained under the subjection of the\r\nKennedys, afterwards earls of Cassillis and marquesses of Ailsa, the\r\nmost powerful family in Ayrshire. Of old Maybole was the capital of the\r\ndistrict of Carrick, and for long its characteristic feature was the\r\nfamily mansions of the barons of Carrick. The castle of the earls of\r\nCassillis still remains. The public buildings include the town-hall, the\r\nAshgrove and the Lumsden fresh-air fortnightly homes, and the Maybole\r\ncombination poorhouse. The leading manufactures are of boots and shoes\r\nand agricultural implements. Two miles to the south-west are the ruins\r\nof Crossraguel (Cross of St Regulus) Abbey, founded about 1240.\r\nKIRKOSWALD, where Burns spent his seventeenth year, learning\r\nland-surveying, lies a little farther west. In the parish churchyard lie\r\n\"Tam o' Shanter\" (Douglas Graham) and \"Souter Johnnie\" (John Davidson).\r\nFour miles to the west of Maybole on the coast is Culzean Castle, the\r\nchief seat of the marquess of Ailsa, dating from 1777; it stands on a\r\nbasaltic cliff, beneath which are the Coves of Culzean, once the retreat\r\nof outlaws and a resort of the fairies. Farther south are the ruins of\r\nTurnberry Castle, where Robert Bruce is said to have been born. A few\r\nmiles to the north of Culzean are the ruins of Dunure Castle, an ancient\r\nstronghold of the Kennedys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYEN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, on the\r\nnorthern declivity of the Eifel range, 16 m. W. from Coblenz, on the\r\nrailway Andernach-Gerolstein. Pop. (1905), 13,435. It is still partly\r\nsurrounded by medieval walls, and the ruins of a castle rise above the\r\ntown. There are some small industries, embracing textile manufactures,\r\noil mills and tanneries, and a trade in wine, while near the town are\r\nextensive quarries of basalt. Having been a Roman settlement, Mayen\r\nbecame a town in 1291. In 1689 it was destroyed by the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYENNE, CHARLES OF LORRAINE, DUKE OF (1554-1611), second son of Francis\r\nof Lorraine, second duke of Guise, was born on the 26th of March 1554.\r\nHe was absent from France at the time of the massacre of Saint\r\nBartholomew, but took part in the siege of La Rochelle in the following\r\nyear, when he was created duke and peer of France. He went with Henry of\r\nValois, duke of Anjou (afterwards Henry III.), on his election as king\r\nof Poland, but soon returned to France to become the energetic supporter\r\nand lieutenant of his brother, the 3rd duke of Guise. In 1577 he gained\r\nconspicuous successes over the Huguenot forces in Poitou. As governor of\r\nBurgundy he raised his province in the cause of the League in 1585. The\r\nassassination of his brothers at Blois on the 23rd and 24th of December\r\n1588 left him at the head of the Catholic party. The Venetian\r\nambassador, Mocenigo, states that Mayenne had warned Henry III. that\r\nthere was a plot afoot to seize his person and to send him by force to\r\nParis. At the time of the murder he was at Lyons, where he received a\r\nletter from the king saying that he had acted on his warning, and\r\nordering him to retire to his government. Mayenne professed obedience,\r\nbut immediately made preparations for marching on Paris. After a vain\r\nattempt to recover the persons of those of his relatives who had been\r\narrested at Blois he proceeded to recruit troops in his government of\r\nBurgundy and in Champagne. Paris was devoted to the house of Guise and\r\nhad been roused to fury by the news of the murder. When Mayenne entered\r\nthe city in February 1589 he found it dominated by representatives of\r\nthe sixteen quarters of Paris, all fanatics of the League. He formed a\r\ncouncil general to direct the affairs of the city and to maintain\r\nrelations with the other towns faithful to the League. To this council\r\neach quarter sent four representatives, and Mayenne added\r\nrepresentatives of the various trades and professions of Paris in order\r\nto counterbalance this revolutionary element. He constituted himself\r\n\"lieutenant-general of the state and crown of France,\" taking his oath\r\nbefore the parlement of Paris. In April he advanced on Tours. Henry III.\r\nin his extremity sought an alliance with Henry of Navarre, and the\r\nallied forces drove the leaguers back, and had laid siege to Paris, when\r\nthe murder of Henry III. by a Dominican fanatic changed the face of\r\naffairs and gave new strength to the Catholic party.\r\n\r\nMayenne was urged to claim the crown for himself, but he was faithful to\r\nthe official programme of the League and proclaimed Charles, cardinal of\r\nBourbon, at that time a prisoner in the hands of Henry IV., as Charles\r\nX. Henry IV. retired to Dieppe, followed by Mayenne, who joined his\r\nforces with those of his cousin Charles, duke of Aumale, and Charles de\r\nCossé, comte de Brissac, and engaged the royal forces in a succession of\r\nfights in the neighbourhood of Arques (September 1589). He was defeated\r\nand out-marched by Henry IV., who moved on Paris, but retreated before\r\nMayenne's forces. In 1590 Mayenne received additions to his army from\r\nthe Spanish Netherlands, and took the field again, only to suffer\r\ncomplete defeat at Ivry (March 14, 1590). He then escaped to Mantes, and\r\nin September collected a fresh army at Meaux, and with the assistance of\r\nAlexander Farnese, prince of Parma, sent by Philip II., raised the siege\r\nof Paris, which was about to surrender to Henry IV. Mayenne feared with\r\nreason the designs of Philip II., and his difficulties were increased by\r\nthe death of Charles X., the \"king of the league.\" The extreme section\r\nof the party, represented by the Sixteen, urged him to proceed to the\r\nelection of a Catholic king and to accept the help and the claims of\r\ntheir Spanish allies. But Mayenne, who had not the popular gifts of his\r\nbrother, the duke of Guise, had no sympathy with the demagogues, and\r\nhimself inclined to the moderate side of his party, which began to urge\r\nreconciliation with Henry IV. He maintained the ancient forms of the\r\nconstitution against the revolutionary policy of the Sixteen, who during\r\nhis absence from Paris took the law into their own hands and in November\r\n1591 executed one of the leaders of the more moderate party, Barnabé\r\nBrisson, president of the parlement. He returned to Paris and executed\r\nfour of the chief malcontents. The power of the Sixteen diminished from\r\nthat time, but with it the strength of the League.[1]\r\n\r\nMayenne entered into negotiations with Henry IV. while he was still\r\nappearing to consider with Philip II. the succession to the French crown\r\nof the Infanta Elizabeth, granddaughter, through her mother Elizabeth of\r\nValois, of Henry II. He demanded that Henry IV. should accomplish his\r\nconversion to Catholicism before he was recognized by the leaguers. He\r\nalso desired the continuation to himself of the high offices which had\r\naccumulated in his family and the reservation of their provinces to his\r\nrelatives among the leaguers. In 1593 he summoned the States General to\r\nParis and placed before them the claims of the Infanta, but they\r\nprotested against foreign intervention. Mayenne signed a truce at La\r\nVillette on the 31st of July 1593. The internal dissensions of the\r\nleague continued to increase, and the principal chiefs submitted.\r\nMayenne finally made his peace only in October 1595. Henry IV. allowed\r\nhim the possession of Chalon-sur-Saône, of Seurre and Soissons for three\r\nyears, made him governor of the Isle of France and paid a large\r\nindemnity. Mayenne died at Soissons on the 3rd of October 1611.\r\n\r\n  A _Histoire de la vie et de la mort du duc de Mayenne_ appeared at\r\n  Lyons in 1618. See also J. B. H. Capefigue, _Hist. de la Réforme, de\r\n  la ligue et du règne de Henri IV._ (8 vols., 1834-1835) and the\r\n  literature dealing with the house of Guise (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The estates of the League in 1593 were the occasion of the famous\r\n    _Satire Ménippée_, circulated in MS. in that year, but only printed\r\n    at Tours in 1594. It was the work of a circle of men of letters who\r\n    belonged to the _politiques_ or party of the centre and ridiculed the\r\n    League. The authors were Pierre Le Roy, Jean Passerat, Florent\r\n    Chrestien, Nicolas Rapin and Pierre Pithou. It opened with \"La vertu\r\n    du catholicon,\" in which a Spanish quack (the cardinal of Plaisance)\r\n    vaunts the virtues of his drug \"catholicon composé,\" manufactured in\r\n    the Escurial, while a Lorrainer rival (the cardinal of Pellevé) tries\r\n    to sell a rival cure. A mock account of the estates, with harangues\r\n    delivered by Mayenne and the other chiefs of the League, followed.\r\n    Mayenne's discourse is said to have been written by the jurist\r\n    Pithou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYENNE, a department of north-western France, three-fourths of which\r\nformerly belonged to Lower Maine and the remainder to Anjou, bounded on\r\nthe N. by Manche and Orne, E. by Sarthe, S. by Maine-et-Loire and W. by\r\nIlle-et-Vilaine. Area, 2012 sq. m. Pop. (1906), 305,457. Its ancient\r\ngeological formations connect it with Brittany. The surface is agreeably\r\nundulating; forests are numerous, and the beauty of the cultivated\r\nportions is enhanced by the hedgerows and lines of trees by which the\r\nfarms are divided. The highest point of the department, and indeed of\r\nthe whole north-west of France, is the Mont des Avaloirs (1368 ft.).\r\nHydrographically Mayenne belongs to the basins of the Loire, the Vilaine\r\nand the Sélune, the first mentioned draining by far the larger part of\r\nthe entire area. The principal stream is the Mayenne, which passes\r\nsuccessively from north to south through Mayenne, Laval and\r\nChâteau-Gontier; by means of weirs and sluices it is navigable below\r\nMayenne, but traffic is inconsiderable. The chief affluents are the\r\nJouanne on the left, and on the right the Colmont, the Ernée and the\r\nOudon. A small area in the east of the department drains by the Erve\r\ninto the Sarthe; the Vilaine rises in the west, and in the north-west\r\ntwo small rivers flow into the Sélune. The climate of Mayenne is\r\ngenerally healthy except in the neighbourhood of the numerous marshes.\r\nThe temperature is lower and the moisture of the atmosphere greater than\r\nin the neighbouring departments; the rainfall (about 32 in. annually) is\r\nabove the average for France.\r\n\r\n  Agriculture and stock-raising are prosperous. A large number of horned\r\n  cattle are reared, and in no other French department are so many\r\n  horses found within the same area; the breed, that of Craon, is famed\r\n  for its strength. Craon has also given its name to the most prized\r\n  breed of pigs in western France. Mayenne produces excellent butter and\r\n  poultry and a large quantity of honey. The cultivation of the vine is\r\n  very limited, and the most common beverage is cider. Wheat, oats,\r\n  barley and buckwheat, in the order named, are the most important\r\n  crops, and a large quantity of flax and hemp is produced. Game is\r\n  abundant. The timber grown is chiefly beech, oak, birch, elm and\r\n  chestnut. The department produces antimony, auriferous quartz and\r\n  coal. Marble, slate and other stone are quarried. There are several\r\n  chalybeate springs. The industries include flour-milling, brick and\r\n  tile making, brewing, cotton and wool spinning, and the production of\r\n  various textile fabrics (especially ticking) for which Laval and\r\n  Château-Gontier are the centres, agricultural implement making, wood\r\n  and marble sawing, tanning and dyeing. The exports include\r\n  agricultural produce, live-stock, stone and textiles; the chief\r\n  imports are coal, brandy, wine, furniture and clothing. The department\r\n  is served by the Western railway. It forms part of the\r\n  circumscriptions of the IV. army corps, the académie (educational\r\n  division) of Rennes, and the court of appeal of Angers. It comprises\r\n  three arrondissements (Laval, Château-Gontier and Mayenne), with 27\r\n  cantons and 276 communes. Laval, the capital, is the seat of a\r\n  bishopric of the province of Tours. The other principal towns are\r\n  Château-Gontier and Mayenne, which are treated under separate\r\n  headings. The following places are also of interest: Evron, which has\r\n  a church of the 12th and 13th centuries; Jublains, with a Roman fort\r\n  and other Roman remains; Lassay, with a fine château of the 14th and\r\n  16th centuries; and Ste Suzanne, which has remains of medieval\r\n  ramparts and a fortress with a keep of the Romanesque period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYENNE, a town of north-western France, capital of an arrondissement in\r\nthe department of Mayenne, 19 m. N.N.E. of Laval by rail. Pop., town\r\n7003, commune 10,020. Mayenne is an old feudal town, irregularly built\r\non hills on both sides of the river Mayenne. Of the old castle\r\noverlooking the river several towers remain, one of which has retained\r\nits conical roof; the vaulted chambers and chapel are ornamented in the\r\nstyle of the 13th century; the building is now used as a prison. The\r\nchurch of Notre-Dame, beside which there is a statue of Joan of Arc,\r\ndates partly from the 12th century; the choir was rebuilt in the 19th\r\ncentury. In the Place de Cheverus is a statue, by David of Angers, to\r\nCardinal Jean de Cheverus (1768-1836), who was born in Mayenne. Mayenne\r\nhas a subprefecture, tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a\r\nchamber of arts and manufactures, and a board of trade-arbitration.\r\nThere is a school of agriculture in the vicinity. The chief industry of\r\nthe place is the manufacture of tickings, linen, handkerchiefs and\r\ncalicoes.\r\n\r\nMayenne had its origin in the castle built here by Juhel, baron of\r\nMayenne, the son of Geoffrey of Maine, in the beginning of the 11th\r\ncentury. It was taken by the English in 1424, and several times suffered\r\ncapture by the opposing parties in the wars of religion and the Vendée.\r\nAt the beginning of the 16th century the territory passed to the family\r\nof Guise, and in 1573 was made a duchy in favour of Charles of Mayenne,\r\nleader of the League.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYER, JOHANN TOBIAS (1723-1762), German astronomer, was born at\r\nMarbach, in Würtemberg, on the 17th of February 1723, and brought up at\r\nEsslingen in poor circumstances. A self-taught mathematician, he had\r\nalready published two original geometrical works when, in 1746, he\r\nentered J. B. Homann's cartographic establishment at Nuremberg. Here he\r\nintroduced many improvements in map-making, and gained a scientific\r\nreputation which led (in 1751) to his election to the chair of economy\r\nand mathematics in the university of Göttingen. In 1754 he became\r\nsuperintendent of the observatory, where he laboured with great zeal and\r\nsuccess until his death, on the 20th of February 1762. His first\r\nimportant astronomical work was a careful investigation of the libration\r\nof the moon (_Kosmographische Nachrichten_, Nuremberg, 1750), and his\r\nchart of the full moon (published in 1775) was unsurpassed for half a\r\ncentury. But his fame rests chiefly on his lunar tables, communicated in\r\n1752, with new solar tables, to the Royal Society of Göttingen, and\r\npublished in their _Transactions_ (vol. ii.). In 1755 he submitted to\r\nthe English government an amended body of MS. tables, which James\r\nBradley compared with the Greenwich observations, and found to be\r\nsufficiently accurate to determine the moon's place to 75´´, and\r\nconsequently the longitude at sea to about half a degree. An improved\r\nset was afterwards published in London (1770), as also the theory\r\n(_Theoria lunae juxta systema Newtonianum_, 1767) upon which the tables\r\nare based. His widow, by whom they were sent to England, received in\r\nconsideration from the British government a grant of £3000. Appended to\r\nthe London edition of the solar and lunar tables are two short\r\ntracts--the one on determining longitude by lunar distances, together\r\nwith a description of the repeating circle (invented by Mayer in 1752),\r\nthe other on a formula for atmospheric refraction, which applies a\r\nremarkably accurate correction for temperature.\r\n\r\nMayer left behind him a considerable quantity of manuscript, part of\r\nwhich was collected by G. C. Lichtenberg and published in one volume\r\n(_Opera inedita_, Göttingen, 1775). It contains an easy and accurate\r\nmethod for calculating eclipses; an essay on colour, in which three\r\nprimary colours are recognized; a catalogue of 998 zodiacal stars; and a\r\nmemoir, the earliest of any real value, on the proper motion of eighty\r\nstars, originally communicated to the Göttingen Royal Society in 1760.\r\nThe manuscript residue includes papers on atmospheric refraction (dated\r\n1755), on the motion of Mars as affected by the perturbations of Jupiter\r\nand the Earth (1756), and on terrestrial magnetism (1760 and 1762). In\r\nthese last Mayer sought to explain the magnetic action of the earth by a\r\nmodification of Euler's hypothesis, and made the first really definite\r\nattempt to establish a mathematical theory of magnetic action (C.\r\nHansteen, _Magnetismus der Erde_, i. 283). E. Klinkerfuss published in\r\n1881 photo-lithographic reproductions of Mayer's local charts and\r\ngeneral map of the moon; and his star-catalogue was re-edited by F.\r\nBaily in 1830 (_Memoirs Roy. Astr. Soc._ iv. 391) and by G. F. J. A.\r\nAuvers in 1894.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--A. G. Kästner, _Elogium Tobiae Mayeri_ (Göttingen,\r\n  1762); _Connaissance des temps, 1767_, p. 187 (J.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYER, JULIUS ROBERT (1814-1878), German physicist, was born at\r\nHeilbronn on the 25th of November 1814, studied medicine at Tübingen,\r\nMunich and Paris, and after a journey to Java in 1840 as surgeon of a\r\nDutch vessel obtained a medical post in his native town. He claims\r\nrecognition as an independent a priori propounder of the \"First Law of\r\nThermodynamics,\" but more especially as having early and ably applied\r\nthat law to the explanation of many remarkable phenomena, both cosmical\r\nand terrestrial. His first little paper on the subject, \"_Bemerkungen\r\nüber die Kräfte der unbelebten Natur_,\" appeared in 1842 in Liebig's\r\n_Annalen_, five years after the republication, in the same journal, of\r\nan extract from K. F. Mohr's paper on the nature of heat, and three\r\nyears later he published _Die organische Bewegung in ihren Zusammenhange\r\nmit dem Stoffwechsel_.\r\n\r\n  It has been repeatedly claimed for Mayer that he calculated the value\r\n  of the dynamical equivalent of heat, indirectly, no doubt, but in a\r\n  manner altogether free from error, and with a result according almost\r\n  exactly with that obtained by J. P. Joule after years of patient\r\n  labour in direct experimenting. This claim on Mayer's behalf was first\r\n  shown to be baseless by W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and P. G. Tait in an\r\n  article on \"Energy,\" published in _Good Words_ in 1862, which gave\r\n  rise to a long but lively discussion. A calm and judicial annihilation\r\n  of the claim is to be found in a brief article by Sir G. G. Stokes,\r\n  _Proc. Roy. Soc._, 1871, p. 54. See also Maxwell's _Theory of Heat_,\r\n  chap. xiii. Mayer entirely ignored the grand fundamental principle\r\n  laid down by Sadi Carnot--that nothing can be concluded as to the\r\n  relation between heat and work from an experiment in which the working\r\n  substance is left at the end of an operation in a different physical\r\n  state from that in which it was at the commencement. Mayer has also\r\n  been styled the discoverer of the fact that heat consists in (the\r\n  energy of) motion, a matter settled at the very end of the 18th\r\n  century by Count Rumford and Sir H. Davy; but in the teeth of this\r\n  statement we have Mayer's own words, \"We might much rather assume the\r\n  contrary--that in order to become heat motion must cease to be\r\n  motion.\"\r\n\r\n  Mayer's real merit consists in the fact that, having for himself made\r\n  out, on inadequate and even questionable grounds, the conservation of\r\n  energy, and having obtained (though by inaccurate reasoning) a\r\n  numerical result correct so far as his data permitted, he applied the\r\n  principle with great power and insight to the explanation of numerous\r\n  physical phenomena. His papers, which were republished in a single\r\n  volume with the title _Die Mechanik der Wärme_ (3rd ed., 1893), are of\r\n  unequal merit. But some, especially those on _Celestial Dynamics_ and\r\n  _Organic Motion_, are admirable examples of what really valuable work\r\n  may be effected by a man of high intellectual powers, in spite of\r\n  imperfect information and defective logic.\r\n\r\n  Different, and it would appear exaggerated, estimates of Mayer are\r\n  given in John Tyndall's papers in the _Phil. Mag._, 1863-1864 (whose\r\n  avowed object was \"to raise a noble and a suffering man to the\r\n  position which his labours entitled him to occupy\"), and in E.\r\n  Dühring's _Robert Mayer, der Galilei des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts_,\r\n  Chemnitz, 1880. Some of the simpler facts of the case are summarized\r\n  by Tait in the _Phil. Mag._, 1864, ii. 289.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYFLOWER, the vessel which carried from Southampton, England, to\r\nPlymouth, Massachusetts, the Pilgrims who established the first\r\npermanent colony in New England. It was of about 180 tons burden, and in\r\ncompany with the \"Speedwell\" sailed from Southampton on the 5th of\r\nAugust 1620, the two having on board 120 Pilgrims. After two trials the\r\n\"Speedwell\" was pronounced unseaworthy, and the \"Mayflower\" sailed alone\r\nfrom Plymouth, England, on the 6th of September with the 100 (or 102)\r\npassengers, some 41 of whom on the 11th of November (O.S.) signed the\r\nfamous \"Mayflower Compact\" in Provincetown Harbor, and a small party of\r\nwhom, including William Bradford, sent to choose a place for settlement,\r\nlanded at what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, on the 11th of December\r\n(21st N.S.), an event which is celebrated, as Forefathers' Day, on the\r\n22nd of December. A \"General Society of Mayflower Descendants\" was\r\norganized in 1894 by lineal descendants of passengers of the \"Mayflower\"\r\nto \"preserve their memory, their records, their history, and all facts\r\nrelating to them, their ancestors and their posterity.\" Every lineal\r\ndescendant, over eighteen years of age, of any passenger of the\r\n\"Mayflower\" is eligible to membership. Branch societies have since been\r\norganized in several of the states and in the District of Columbia, and\r\na triennial congress is held in Plymouth.\r\n\r\n  See Azel Ames, _The May-Flower and Her Log_ (Boston, 1901); Blanche\r\n  McManus, _The Voyage of the Mayflower_ (New York, 1897); _The General\r\n  Society of Mayflower: Meetings, Officers and Members, arranged in\r\n  State Societies, Ancestors and their Descendants_ (New York, 1901).\r\n  Also the articles PLYMOUTH, MASS.; MASSACHUSETTS, §_History_; PILGRIM;\r\n  and PROVINCETOWN, MASS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY-FLY. The Mayflies belong to the Ephemeridae, a remarkable family of\r\nwinged insects, included by Linnaeus in his order Neuroptera, which\r\nderive their scientific name from [Greek: ephêmeros], in allusion to\r\ntheir very short lives. In some species it is possible that they have\r\nscarcely more than one day's existence, but others are far longer lived,\r\nthough the extreme limit is probably rarely more than a week. The family\r\nhas very sharply defined characters, which separate its members at once\r\nfrom all other neuropterous (or pseudo-neuropterous) groups.\r\n\r\nThese insects are universally aquatic in their preparatory states. The\r\neggs are dropped into the water by the female in large masses,\r\nresembling, in some species, bunches of grapes in miniature. Probably\r\nseveral months elapse before the young larvae are excluded. The\r\nsub-aquatic condition lasts a considerable time: in _Cloeon_, a genus of\r\nsmall and delicate species, Sir J. Lubbock (Lord Avebury) proved it to\r\nextend over more than six months; but in larger and more robust genera\r\n(e.g. _Palingenia_) there appears reason to believe that the greater\r\npart of three years is occupied in preparatory conditions.\r\n\r\n  The larva is elongate and campodeiform. The head is rather large, and\r\n  is furnished at first with five simple eyes of nearly equal size; but\r\n  as it increases in size the homologues of the facetted eyes of the\r\n  imago become larger, whereas those equivalent to the ocelli remain\r\n  small. The antennae are long and thread-like, composed at first of few\r\n  joints, but the number of these latter apparently increases at each\r\n  moult. The mouth parts are well developed, consisting of an upper lip,\r\n  powerful mandibles, maxillae with three-jointed palpi, and a deeply\r\n  quadrifid labium or lower lip with three-jointed labial palpi.\r\n  Distinct and conspicuous maxillulae are associated with the tongue or\r\n  hypopharynx. There are three distinct and large thoracic segments,\r\n  whereof the prothorax is narrower than the others; the legs are much\r\n  shorter and stouter than in the winged insect, with monomerous tarsi\r\n  terminated by a single claw. The abdomen consists of ten segments, the\r\n  tenth furnished with long and slender multi-articulate tails, which\r\n  appear to be only two in number at first, but an intermediate one\r\n  gradually develops itself (though this latter is often lost in the\r\n  winged insect). Respiration is effected by means of external gills\r\n  placed along both sides of the dorsum of the abdomen and hinder\r\n  segments of the thorax. These vary in form: in some species they are\r\n  entire plates, in others they are cut up into numerous divisions, in\r\n  all cases traversed by numerous tracheal ramifications. According to\r\n  the researches of Lubbock and of E. Joly, the very young larvae have\r\n  no breathing organs, and respiration is effected through the skin.\r\n  Lubbock traced at least twenty moults in _Cloeon_; at about the tenth\r\n  rudiments of the wing-cases began to appear. These gradually become\r\n  larger, and when so the creature may be said to have entered its\r\n  \"nymph\" stage; but there is no condition analogous to the pupa-stage\r\n  of insects with complete metamorphoses.\r\n\r\n  There may be said to be three or four different modes of life in these\r\n  larvae: some are fossorial, and form tubes in the mud or clay in which\r\n  they live; others are found on or beneath stones; while others again\r\n  swim and crawl freely among water plants. It is probable that some are\r\n  carnivorous, either attacking other larvae or subsisting on more\r\n  minute forms of animal life; but others perhaps feed more exclusively\r\n  on vegetable matters of a low type, such as diatoms.\r\n\r\n  The most aberrant type of larva is that of the genus _Prosopistoma_,\r\n  which was originally described as an entomostracous crustacean on\r\n  account of the presence of a large carapace overlapping the greater\r\n  part of the body. The dorsal skeletal elements of the thorax and of\r\n  the anterior six abdominal segments unite with the wing-cases to form\r\n  a large respiratory chamber, containing five pairs of tracheal gills,\r\n  with lateral slits for the inflow and a posterior orifice for the\r\n  outflow of water. Species of this genus occur in Europe, Africa and\r\n  Madagascar.\r\n\r\nWhen the aquatic insect has reached its full growth it emerges from the\r\nwater or seeks its surface; the thorax splits down the back and the\r\nwinged form appears. But this is not yet perfect, although it has all\r\nthe form of a perfect insect and is capable of flight; it is what is\r\nvariously termed a \"pseud-imago,\" \"sub-imago\" or \"pro-imago.\" Contrary\r\nto the habits of all other insects, there yet remains a pellicle that\r\nhas to be shed, covering every part of the body. This final moult is\r\neffected soon after the insect's appearance in the winged form; the\r\ncreature seeks a temporary resting-place, the pellicle splits down the\r\nback, and the now perfect insect comes forth, often differing very\r\ngreatly in colours and markings from the condition in which it was only\r\na few moments before. If the observer takes up a suitable position near\r\nwater, his coat is often seen to be covered with the cast sub-imaginal\r\nskins of these insects, which had chosen him as a convenient object upon\r\nwhich to undergo their final change. In some few genera of very low type\r\nit appears probable that, at any rate in the female, this final change\r\nis never effected and that the creature dies a sub-imago.\r\n\r\n  The winged insect differs considerably in form from its sub-aquatic\r\n  condition. The head is smaller, often occupied almost entirely above\r\n  in the male by the very large eyes, which in some species are\r\n  curiously double in that sex, one portion being pillared, and forming\r\n  what is termed a \"turban,\" the mouth parts are aborted, for the\r\n  creature is now incapable of taking nutriment either solid or fluid;\r\n  the antennae are mere short bristles, consisting of two rather large\r\n  basal joints and a multi-articulate thread. The prothorax is much\r\n  narrowed, whereas the other segments (especially the mesothorax) are\r\n  greatly enlarged; the legs long and slender, the anterior pair often\r\n  very much longer in the male than in the female; the tarsi four- or\r\n  five-jointed; but in some genera (e.g. _Oligoneuria_ and allies) the\r\n  legs are aborted, and the creatures are driven helplessly about by the\r\n  wind. The wings are carried erect: the anterior pair large, with\r\n  numerous longitudinal nervures, and usually abundant transverse\r\n  reticulation; the posterior pair very much smaller, often lanceolate,\r\n  and frequently wanting absolutely. The abdomen consists of ten\r\n  segments; at the end are either two or three long multi-articulate\r\n  tails; in the male the ninth joint bears forcipated appendages; in the\r\n  female the oviducts terminate at the junction of the seventh and\r\n  eighth ventral segments. The independent opening of the genital ducts\r\n  and the absence of an ectodermal vagina and ejaculatory duct are\r\n  remarkable archaic features of these insects, as has been pointed out\r\n  by J. A. Palmén. The sexual act takes place in the air, and is of very\r\n  short duration, but is apparently repeated several times, at any rate\r\n  in some cases.\r\n\r\n_Ephemeridae_ are found all over the world, even up to high northern\r\nlatitudes. F. J. Pictet, A. E. Eaton and others have given us valuable\r\nworks or monographs on the family; but the subject still remains little\r\nunderstood, partly owing to the great difficulty of preserving such\r\ndelicate insects; and it appears probable they can only be\r\nsatisfactorily investigated as moist preparations. The number of\r\ndescribed species is less than 200, spread over many genera.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times attention has been drawn to the enormous\r\nabundance of species of the family in certain localities. Johann Anton\r\nScopoli, writing in the 18th century, speaks of them as so abundant in\r\none place in Carniola that in June twenty cartloads were carried away\r\nfor manure! _Polymitarcys virgo_, which, though not found in England,\r\noccurs in many parts of Europe (and is common at Paris), emerges from\r\nthe water soon after sunset, and continues for several hours in such\r\nmyriads as to resemble snow showers, putting out lights, and causing\r\ninconvenience to man, and annoyance to horses by entering their\r\nnostrils. In other parts of the world they have been recorded in\r\nmultitudes that obscured passers-by on the other side of the street. And\r\nsimilar records might be multiplied almost to any extent. In Britain,\r\nalthough they are often very abundant, we have scarcely anything\r\nanalogous.\r\n\r\nFish, as is well known, devour them greedily, and enjoy a veritable\r\nfeast during the short period in which any particular species appears.\r\nBy anglers the common English species of _Ephemera_ (_vulgata_ and\r\n_danica_, but more especially the latter, which is more abundant) is\r\nknown as the \"may-fly,\" but the terms \"green drake\" and \"bastard drake\"\r\nare applied to conditions of the same species. Useful information on\r\nthis point will be found in Ronalds's _Fly-Fisher's Entomology_, edited\r\nby Westwood.\r\n\r\nEphemeridae belong to a very ancient type of insects, and fossil\r\nimprints of allied forms occur even in the Devonian and Carboniferous\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nThere is much to be said in favour of the view entertained by some\r\nentomologists that the structural and developmental characteristics of\r\nmay-flies are sufficiently peculiar to warrant the formation for them of\r\na special order of insects, for which the names Agnatha, Plectoptera and\r\nEphemeroptera have been proposed.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYHEM (for derivation see MAIMING), an old Anglo-French term of the law\r\nsignifying an assault whereby the injured person is deprived of a member\r\nproper for his defence in fight, e.g. an arm, a leg, a fore tooth, &c.\r\nThe loss of an ear, jaw tooth, &c., was not mayhem. The most ancient\r\npunishment in English law was retaliative--_membrum pro membro_, but\r\nultimately at common law fine and imprisonment. Various statutes were\r\npassed aimed at the offence of maiming and disfiguring, which is now\r\ndealt with by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.\r\nMayhem may also be the ground of a civil action, which had this\r\npeculiarity that the court on sight of the wound might increase the\r\ndamages awarded by the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYHEW, HENRY (1812-1887), English author and journalist, son of a\r\nLondon solicitor, was born in 1812. He was sent to Westminster school,\r\nbut ran away to sea. He sailed to India, and on his return studied law\r\nfor a short time under his father. He began his journalistic career by\r\nfounding, with Gilbert à Beckett, in 1831, a weekly paper, _Figaro in\r\nLondon_. This was followed in 1832 by a short-lived paper called _The\r\nThief_; and he produced one or two successful farces. His brothers\r\nHorace (1816-1872) and Augustus Septimus (1826-1875) were also\r\njournalists, and with them Henry occasionally collaborated, notably with\r\nthe younger in _The Greatest Plague of Life_ (1847) and in _Acting\r\nCharades_ (1850). In 1841 Henry Mayhew was one of the leading spirits\r\nin the foundation of _Punch_, of which he was for the first two years\r\njoint-editor with Mark Lemon. He afterwards wrote on all kinds of\r\nsubjects, and published a number of volumes of no permanent\r\nreputation--humorous stories, travel and practical handbooks. He is\r\ncredited with being the first to \"write up\" the poverty side of London\r\nlife from a philanthropic point of view; with the collaboration of John\r\nBinny and others he published _London Labour and London Poor_ (1851;\r\ncompleted 1864) and other works on social and economic questions. He\r\ndied in London, on the 25th of July 1887. Horace Mayhew was for some\r\nyears sub-editor of _Punch_, and was the author of several humorous\r\npublications and plays. The books of Horace and Augustus Mayhew owe\r\ntheir survival chiefly to Cruikshank's illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYHEW, JONATHAN (1720-1766), American clergyman, was born at Martha's\r\nVineyard on the 8th of October 1720, being fifth in descent from Thomas\r\nMayhew (1592-1682), an early settler and the grantee (1641) of Martha's\r\nVineyard. Thomas Mayhew (c. 1616-1657), the younger, his son John (d.\r\n1689) and John's son, Experience (1673-1758), were active missionaries\r\namong the Indians of Martha's Vineyard and the vicinity. Jonathan, the\r\nson of Experience, graduated at Harvard in 1744. So liberal were his\r\ntheological views that when he was to be ordained minister of the West\r\nChurch in Boston in 1747 only two ministers attended the first council\r\ncalled for the ordination, and it was necessary to summon a second\r\ncouncil. Mayhew's preaching made his church practically the first\r\n\"Unitarian\" Congregational church in New England, though it was never\r\nofficially Unitarian. In 1763 he published _Observations on the Charter\r\nand Conduct of the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts_,\r\nan attack on the policy of the society in sending missionaries to New\r\nEngland contrary to its original purpose of \"Maintaining Ministers of\r\nthe Gospel\" in places \"wholly destitute and unprovided with means for\r\nthe maintenance of ministers and for the public worship of God;\" the\r\n_Observations_ marked him as a leader among those in New England who\r\nfeared, as Mayhew said (1762), \"that there is a scheme forming for\r\nsending a bishop into this part of the country, and that our\r\nGovernor,[1] a true churchman, is deeply in the plot.\" To an American\r\nreply to the _Observations_, entitled _A Candid Examination_ (1763),\r\nMayhew wrote a _Defense_; and after the publication of an _Answer_,\r\nanonymously published in London in 1764 and written by Thomas Seeker,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, he wrote a _Second Defense_. He bitterly\r\nopposed the Stamp Act, and urged the necessity of colonial union (or\r\n\"communion\") to secure colonial liberties. He died on the 9th of July\r\n1766. Mayhew was Dudleian lecturer at Harvard in 1765, and in 1749 had\r\nreceived the degree of D.D. from the University of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n  See Alden Bradford, _Memoir of the Life and Writings of Rev. Jonathan\r\n  Mayhew_ (Boston, 1838), and \"An Early Pulpit Champion of Colonial\r\n  Rights,\" chapter vi., in vol. i. of M. C. Tyler's _Literary History of\r\n  the American Revolution_ (2 vols., New York, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Francis Bernard, whose project for a college at Northampton\r\n    seemed to Mayhew and others a move to strengthen Anglicanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYHEW, THOMAS, English 18th century cabinet-maker. Mayhew was the less\r\ndistinguished partner of William Ince (q.v.). The chief source of\r\ninformation as to his work is supplied by his own drawings in the volume\r\nof designs, _The universal system of household furniture_, which he\r\npublished in collaboration with his partner. The name of the firm\r\nappears to have been Mayhew and Ince, but on the title page of this book\r\nthe names are reversed, perhaps as an indication that Ince was the more\r\nextensive contributor. In the main Mayhew's designs are heavy and\r\nclumsy, and often downright extravagant, but he had a certain lightness\r\nof accomplishment in his applications of the bizarre Chinese style. Of\r\noriginal talent he possessed little, yet it is certain that much of his\r\nChinese work has been attributed to Chippendale. It is indeed often only\r\nby reference to books of design that the respective work of the English\r\ncabinet-makers of the second half of the 18th century can be correctly\r\nattributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYMYO, a hill sanatorium in India, in the Mandalay district of Upper\r\nBurma, 3500 ft. above the sea, with a station on the Mandalay-Lashio\r\nrailway 422 m. from Rangoon. Pop. (1901), 6223. It consists of an\r\nundulating plateau, surrounded by hills, which are covered with thin oak\r\nforest and bracken. Though not entirely free from malaria, it has been\r\nchosen for the summer residence of the lieutenant-governor; and it is\r\nalso the permanent headquarters of the lieutenant-general commanding the\r\nBurma division, and of other officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYNARD, FRANÇOIS DE (1582-1646), French poet, was born at Toulouse in\r\n1582. His father was _conseiller_ in the parlement of the town, and\r\nFrançois was also trained for the law, becoming eventually president of\r\nAurillac. He became secretary to Margaret of Valois, wife of Henry IV.,\r\nfor whom his early poems are written. He was a disciple of Malherbe, who\r\nsaid that in the workmanship of his lines he excelled Racan, but lacked\r\nhis rival's energy. In 1634 he accompanied the Cardinal de Noailles to\r\nRome and spent about two years in Italy. On his return to France he made\r\nmany unsuccessful efforts to obtain the favour of Richelieu, but was\r\nobliged to retire to Toulouse. He never ceased to lament his exile from\r\nParis and his inability to be present at the meetings of the Academy, of\r\nwhich he was one of the earliest members. The best of his poems is in\r\nimitation of Horace, \"Alcippe, reviens dans nos bois.\" He died at\r\nToulouse on the 23rd of December 1646.\r\n\r\n  His works consist of odes, epigrams, songs and letters, and were\r\n  published in 1646 by Marin le Roy de Gomberville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYNE, JASPER (1604-1672), English author, was baptized at Hatherleigh,\r\nDevonshire, on the 23rd of November 1604. He was educated at Westminster\r\nSchool and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he had a distinguished\r\ncareer. He was presented to two college livings in Oxfordshire, and was\r\nmade D.D. in 1646. During the Commonwealth he was dispossessed, and\r\nbecame chaplain to the duke of Devonshire. At the Restoration he was\r\nmade canon of Christ Church, archdeacon of Chichester and chaplain in\r\nordinary to the king. He wrote a farcical domestic comedy, _The City\r\nMatch_ (1639), which is reprinted in vol. xiii. of Hazlitt's edition of\r\nDodsley's _Old Plays_, and a fantastic tragi-comedy entitled _The\r\nAmorous War_ (printed 1648). After receiving ecclesiastical preferment\r\nhe gave up poetry as unbefitting his profession. His other works\r\ncomprise some occasional gems, a translation of Lucian's _Dialogues_\r\n(printed 1664) and a number of sermons. He died on the 6th of December\r\n1672 at Oxford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYNOOTH, a small town of county Kildare, Ireland, on the Midland Great\r\nWestern railway and the Royal Canal, 15 m. W. by N. of Dublin. Pop.\r\n(1901), 948. The Royal Catholic College of Maynooth, founded by an Act\r\nof the Irish parliament in 1795, is the chief seminary for the education\r\nof the Roman Catholic clergy of Ireland. The building is a fine Gothic\r\nstructure by A. W. Pugin, erected by a parliamentary grant obtained in\r\n1846. The chapel, with fine oak choir-stalls, mosaic pavements, marble\r\naltars and stained glass, and with adjoining cloisters, was dedicated in\r\n1890. The average number of students is about 500--the number specified\r\nunder the act of 1845--and the full course of instruction is eight\r\nyears. Near the college stand the ruins of Maynooth Castle, probably\r\nbuilt in 1176, but subsequently extended, and formerly the residence of\r\nthe Fitzgerald family. It was besieged in the reigns of Henry VIII. and\r\nEdward VI., and during the Cromwellian Wars, when it was demolished. The\r\nbeautiful mansion of Carton is about a mile from the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYO, RICHARD SOUTHWELL BOURKE, 6TH EARL OF (1822-1872), British\r\nstatesman, son of Robert Bourke, the 5th earl (1797-1867), was born in\r\nDublin on the 21st of February, 1822, and was educated at Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin. After travelling in Russia he entered parliament, and\r\nsat successively for Kildare, Coleraine and Cockermouth. He was chief\r\nsecretary for Ireland in three administrations, in 1852, 1858 and 1866,\r\nand was appointed viceroy of India in January 1869. He consolidated the\r\nfrontiers of India and met Shere Ali, amir of Afghanistan, in durbar at\r\nUmballa in March 1869. His reorganization of the finances of the country\r\nput India on a paying basis; and he did much to promote irrigation,\r\nrailways, forests and other useful public works. Visiting the convict\r\nsettlement at Port Blair in the Andaman Islands, for the purpose of\r\ninspection, the viceroy was assassinated by a convict on the 8th of\r\nFebruary 1872. His successor was his son, Dermot Robert Wyndham Bourke\r\n(b. 1851) who became 7th earl of Mayo.\r\n\r\n  See Sir W. W. Hunter, _Life of the Earl of Mayo_, (1876), and _The\r\n  Earl of Mayo_ in the Rulers of India Series (1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYO, a western county of Ireland, in the province of Connaught, bounded\r\nN. and W. by the Atlantic Ocean, N.E. by Sligo, E. by Roscommon, S.E.\r\nand S. by Galway. The area is 1,380,390 acres, or about 2157 sq. m., the\r\ncounty being the largest in Ireland after Cork and Galway. About\r\ntwo-thirds of the boundary of Mayo is formed by sea, and the coast is\r\nvery much indented, and abounds in picturesque scenery. The principal\r\ninlets are Killary Harbour between Mayo and Galway; Clew Bay, in which\r\nare the harbours of Westport and Newport; Blacksod Bay and Broad Haven,\r\nwhich form the peninsula of the Mullet; and Killala Bay between Mayo and\r\nSligo. The islands are very numerous, the principal being Inishturk,\r\nnear Killary Harbour; Clare Island, at the mouth of Clew Bay, where\r\nthere are many islets, all formed of drift; and Achill, the largest\r\nisland off Ireland. The coast scenery is not surpassed by that of\r\nDonegal northward and Connemara southward, and there are several small\r\ncoast-towns, among which may be named Killala on the north coast,\r\nBelmullet on the isthmus between Blacksod Bay and Broad Haven, Newport\r\nand Westport on Clew Bay, with the watering-place of Mallaranny. The\r\nmajestic cliffs of the north coast, however, which reach an extreme\r\nheight in Benwee Head (892 ft.), are difficult of access and rarely\r\nvisited. In the eastern half of the county the surface is comparatively\r\nlevel, with occasional hills; the western half is mountainous. Mweelrea\r\n(2688 ft.) is included in a mountain range lying between Killary Harbour\r\nand Lough Mask. The next highest summits are Nephin (2646 ft.), to the\r\nwest of Lough Conn, and Croagh Patrick (2510 ft.), to the south of Clew\r\nBay. The river Moy flows northwards, forming part of the boundary of the\r\ncounty with Sligo, and falls into Killala Bay. The courses of the other\r\nstreams are short, and except when swollen by rains their volume is\r\nsmall. The principal lakes are Lough Mask and Lough Corrib, on the\r\nborders of the county with Galway, and Loughs Conn in the east,\r\nCarrowmore in the north-west, Beltra in the west, and Carra adjoining\r\nLough Mask. These loughs and the smaller loughs, with the streams\r\ngenerally, afford admirable sport with salmon, sea-trout and brown\r\ntrout, and Ballina is a favourite centre.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--The wild and barren west of this county, including the\r\n  great hills on Achill Island, is formed of \"Dalradian\" rocks, schists\r\n  and quartzites, highly folded and metamorphosed, with intrusions of\r\n  granite near Belmullet. At Blacksod Bay the granite has been quarried\r\n  as an ornamental stone. Nephin Beg, Nephin and Croagh Patrick are\r\n  typical quartzite summits, the last named belonging possibly to a\r\n  Silurian horizon but rising from a metamorphosed area on the south\r\n  side of Clew Bay. The schists and gneisses of the Ox Mountain axis\r\n  also enter the county north of Castlebar. The Muilrea and Ben Gorm\r\n  range, bounding the fine fjord of Killary Harbour, is formed of\r\n  terraced Silurian rocks, from Bala to Ludlow age. These beds, with\r\n  intercalated lavas, form the mountainous west shore of Lough Mask, the\r\n  east, like that of Lough Corrib, being formed of low Carboniferous\r\n  Limestone ground. Silurian rocks, with Old Red Sandstone over them,\r\n  come out at the west end of the Curlew range at Ballaghaderreen. Clew\r\n  Bay, with its islets capped by glacial drift, is a submerged part of a\r\n  synclinal of Carboniferous strata, and Old Red Sandstone comes out on\r\n  the north side of this, from near Achill to Lough Conn. The country\r\n  from Lough Conn northward to the sea is a lowland of Carboniferous\r\n  Limestone, with L. Carboniferous Sandstone against the Dalradian on\r\n  the west.\r\n\r\n  _Industries._--There are some very fertile regions in the level\r\n  portions of the county, but in the mountainous districts the soil is\r\n  poor, the holdings are subdivided beyond the possibility of affording\r\n  proper sustenance to their occupiers, and, except where fishing is\r\n  combined with agricultural operations, the circumstances of the\r\n  peasantry are among the most wretched of any district of Ireland. The\r\n  proportion of tillage to pasturage is roughly as 1 to 3½. Oats and\r\n  potatoes are the principal crops. Cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry are\r\n  reared. Coarse linen and woollen cloths are manufactured to a small\r\n  extent. At Foxford woollen-mills are established at a nunnery, in\r\n  connexion with a scheme of technical instruction. Keel, Belmullet and\r\n  Ballycastle are the headquarters of sea and coast fishing districts,\r\n  and Ballina of a salmon-fishing district, and these fisheries are of\r\n  some value to the poor inhabitants. A branch of the Midland Great\r\n  Western railway enters the county from Athlone, in the south-east, and\r\n  runs north to Ballina and Killala on the coast, branches diverging\r\n  from Claremorris to Ballinrobe, and from Manulla to Westport and\r\n  Achill on the west coast. The Limerick and Sligo line of the Great\r\n  Southern and Western passes from south to north-east by way of\r\n  Claremorris.\r\n\r\n_Population and Administration._--The population was 218,698 in 1891,\r\nand 199,166 in 1901. The decrease of population and the number of\r\nemigrants are slightly below the average of the Irish counties. Of the\r\ntotal population about 97% are rural, and about the same percentage are\r\nRoman Catholics. The chief towns are Ballina (pop. 4505), Westport\r\n(3892) and Castlebar (3585), the county town. Ballaghaderreen,\r\nClaremorris (Clare), Crossmolina and Swineford are lesser market towns;\r\nand Newport and Westport are small seaports on Clew Bay. The county\r\nincludes nine baronies. Assizes are held at Castlebar, and quarter\r\nsessions at Ballina, Ballinrobe, Belmullet, Castlebar, Claremorris,\r\nSwineford and Westport. In the Irish parliament two members were\r\nreturned for the county, and two for the borough of Castlebar, but at\r\nthe union Castlebar was disfranchised. The division since 1885 is into\r\nnorth, south, east and west parliamentary divisions, each returning one\r\nmember. The county is in the Protestant diocese of Tuam and the Roman\r\nCatholic dioceses of Taum, Achonry, Galway and Kilmacduagh, and Killala.\r\n\r\n_History and Antiquities._--Erris in Mayo was the scene of the landing\r\nof the chief colony of the Firbolgs, and the battle which is said to\r\nhave resulted in the overthrow and almost annihilation of this tribe\r\ntook place also in this county, at Moytura near Cong. At the close of\r\nthe 12th century what is now the county of Mayo was granted, with other\r\nlands, by king John to William, brother of Hubert de Burgh. After the\r\nmurder of William de Burgh, 3rd earl of Ulster (1333), the Bourkes (de\r\nBurghs) of the collateral male line, rejecting the claim of William's\r\nheiress (the wife of Lionel, son of King Edward III.) to the succession,\r\nsucceeded in holding the bulk of the De Burgh possessions, what is now\r\nMayo falling to the branch known by the name of \"MacWilliam Oughter,\"\r\nwho maintained their virtual independence till the time of Elizabeth.\r\nSir Henry Sydney, during his first viceroyalty, after making efforts to\r\nimprove communications between Dublin and Connaught in 1566, arranged\r\nfor the shiring of that province, and Mayo was made shire ground, taking\r\nits name from the monastery of Maio or Mageo, which was the seat of a\r\nbishop. Even after this period the MacWilliams continued to exercise\r\nvery great authority, which was regularized in 1603, when \"the\r\nMacWilliam Oughter,\" Theobald Bourke, surrendered his lands and received\r\nthem back, to hold them by English tenure, with the title of Viscount\r\nMayo (see BURGH, DE). Large confiscations of the estates in the county\r\nwere made in 1586, and on the termination of the wars of 1641; and in\r\n1666 the restoration of his estates to the 4th Viscount Mayo involved\r\nanother confiscation, at the expense of Cromwell's settlers. Killala was\r\nthe scene of the landing of a French squadron in connexion with the\r\nrebellion of 1798. In 1879 the village of Knock in the south-east\r\nacquired notoriety from a story that the Virgin Mary had appeared in the\r\nchurch, which became the resort of many pilgrims.\r\n\r\nThere are round towers at Killala, Turlough, Meelick and Balla, and an\r\nimperfect one at Aughagower. Killala was formerly a bishopric. The\r\nmonasteries were numerous, and many of them of considerable importance:\r\nthe principal being those at Mayo, Ballyhaunis, Cong, Ballinrobe,\r\nBallintober, Burrishoole, Cross or Holycross in the peninsula of Mullet,\r\nMoyne, Roserk or Rosserick and Templemore or Strade. Of the old castles\r\nthe most notable are Carrigahooly near Newport, said to have been built\r\nby the celebrated Grace O'Malley, and Deel Castle near Ballina, at one\r\ntime the residence of the earls of Arran.\r\n\r\n  See Hubert Thomas Knox, _History of the County of Mayo_ (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYOR, JOHN EYTON BICKERSTETH (1825-   ), English classical scholar, was\r\nborn at Baddegama, Ceylon, on the 28th of January 1825, and educated in\r\nEngland at Shrewsbury School and St John's College, Cambridge. From 1863\r\nto 1867 he was librarian of the university, and in 1872 succeeded H. A.\r\nJ. Munro in the professorship of Latin. His best-known work, an edition\r\nof thirteen satires of Juvenal, is marked by an extraordinary wealth of\r\nillustrative quotations. His _Bibliographical Clue to Latin Literature_\r\n(1873), based on E. Hübner's _Grundriss zu Vorlesungen über die römische\r\nLitteraturgeschichte_ is a valuable aid to the student, and his edition\r\nof Cicero's _Second Philippic_ is widely used. He also edited the\r\nEnglish works of J. Fisher, bishop of Rochester, i. (1876); Thomas\r\nBaker's _History of St John's College, Cambridge_ (1869); Richard of\r\nCirencester's _Speculum historiale de gestis regum Angliae 447-1066_\r\n(1863-1869); Roger Ascham's _Schoolmaster_ (new ed., 1883); the _Latin\r\nHeptateuch_ (1889); and the _Journal of Philology_.\r\n\r\nHis brother, JOSEPH BICKERSTETH MAYOR (1828-   ), classical scholar and\r\ntheologian, was educated at Rugby and St John's College, Cambridge, and\r\nfrom 1870 to 1879 was professor of classics at King's College, London.\r\nHis most important classical works are an edition of Cicero's _De natura\r\ndeorum_ (3 vols., 1880-1885) and _Guide to the Choice of Classical\r\nBooks_ (3rd ed., 1885, with supplement, 1896). He also devoted attention\r\nto theological literature and edited the epistles of St James (2nd ed.,\r\n1892), St Jude and St Peter (1907), and the _Miscellanies_ of Clement of\r\nAlexandria (with F. J. A. Hort, 1902). From 1887 to 1893 he was editor\r\nof the _Classical Review_. His _Chapters on English Metre_ (1886)\r\nreached a second edition in 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYOR (Lat. _major_, greater), in modern times the title of a municipal\r\nofficer who discharges judicial and administrative functions. The French\r\nform of the word is _maire_. In Germany the corresponding title is\r\n_Bürgermeister_, in Italy _sindico_, and in Spain _alcalde_. \"Mayor\" had\r\noriginally a much wider significance. Among the nations which arose on\r\nthe ruins of the Roman empire of the West, and which made use of the\r\nLatin spoken by their \"Roman\" subjects as their official and legal\r\nlanguage, _major_ and the Low Latin feminine _majorissa_ were found to\r\nbe very convenient terms to describe important officials of both sexes\r\nwho had the superintendence of others. Any female servant or slave in\r\nthe household of a barbarian, whose business it was to overlook other\r\nfemale servants or slaves, would be quite naturally called a\r\n_majorissa_. So the male officer who governed the king's household would\r\nbe the _major domus_. In the households of the Frankish kings of the\r\nMerovingian line, the _major domus_, who was also variously known as the\r\n_gubernator_, _rector_, _moderator_ or _praefectus palatii_, was so\r\ngreat an officer that he ended by evicting his master. He was the \"mayor\r\nof the palace\" (q.v.). The fact that his office became hereditary in the\r\nfamily of Pippin of Heristal made the fortune of the Carolingian line.\r\nBut besides the _major domus_ (the major-domo), there were other\r\nofficers who were _majores_, the _major cubiculi_, mayor of the\r\nbedchamber, and _major equorum_, mayor of the horse. In fact a word\r\nwhich could be applied so easily and with accuracy in so many\r\ncircumstances was certain to be widely used by itself, or in its\r\nderivatives. The post-Augustine _majorinus_, \"one of the larger kind,\"\r\nwas the origin of the medieval Spanish _merinus_, who in Castillian is\r\nthe _merino_, and sometimes the _merino mayor_, or chief merino. He was\r\na judicial and administrative officer of the king's. The _gregum\r\nmerinus_ was the superintendent of the flocks of the corporation of\r\nsheep-owners called the _mesta_. From him the sheep, and then the wool,\r\nhave come to be known as _merinos_--a word identical in origin with the\r\nmunicipal title of mayor. The latter came directly from the heads of\r\ngilds, and other associations of freemen, who had their banner and\r\nformed a group on the populations of the towns, the _majores baneriae_\r\nor _vexilli_.\r\n\r\nIn England the major is the modern representative of the lord's bailiff\r\nor reeve (see BOROUGH). We find the chief magistrate of London bearing\r\nthe title of portreeve for considerably more than a century after the\r\nConquest. This official was elected by popular choice, a privilege\r\nsecured from king John. By the beginning of the 11th century the title\r\nof portreeve[1] gave way to that of mayor as the designation of the\r\nchief officer of London,[2] and the adoption of the title by other\r\nboroughs followed at various intervals.\r\n\r\n  A mayor is now in England and America the official head of a municipal\r\n  government. In the United Kingdom the Municipal Corporations Act,\r\n  1882, s. 15, regulates the election of mayors. He is to be a fit\r\n  person elected annually on the 9th of November by the council of the\r\n  borough from among the aldermen or councillors or persons qualified to\r\n  be such. His term of office is one year, but he is eligible for\r\n  re-election. He may appoint a deputy to act during illness or absence,\r\n  and such deputy must be either an alderman or councillor. A mayor who\r\n  is absent from the borough for more than two months becomes\r\n  disqualified and vacates his office. A mayor is _ex officio_ during\r\n  his year of office and the next year a justice of the peace for the\r\n  borough. He receives such remuneration as the council thinks\r\n  reasonable. The office of mayor in an English borough does not entail\r\n  any important administrative duties. It is generally regarded as an\r\n  honour conferred for past services. The mayor is expected to devote\r\n  much of his time to ornamental functions and to preside over meetings\r\n  which have for their object the advancement of the public welfare. His\r\n  administrative duties are merely to act as returning officer at\r\n  municipal elections, and as chairman of the meetings of the council.\r\n\r\n  The position and power of an English mayor contrast very strongly with\r\n  those of the similar official in the United States. The latter is\r\n  elected directly by the voters within the city, usually for several\r\n  years; and he has extensive administrative powers.\r\n\r\n  The English method of selecting a mayor by the council is followed for\r\n  the corresponding functionaries in France (except Paris), the more\r\n  important cities of Italy, and in Germany, where, however, the central\r\n  government must confirm the choice of the council. Direct appointment\r\n  by the central government exists in Belgium, Holland, Denmark, Norway,\r\n  Sweden and the smaller towns of Italy and Spain. As a rule, too, the\r\n  term of office is longer in other countries than in the United\r\n  Kingdom. In France election is for four years, in Holland for six, in\r\n  Belgium for an indefinite period, and in Germany usually for twelve\r\n  years, but in some cases for life. In Germany the post may be said to\r\n  be a professional one, the burgomaster being the head of the city\r\n  magistracy, and requiring, in order to be eligible, a training in\r\n  administration. German burgomasters are most frequently elected by\r\n  promotion from another city. In France the _maire_, and a number of\r\n  experienced members termed \"adjuncts,\" who assist him as an executive\r\n  committee, are elected directly by the municipal council from among\r\n  their own number. Most of the administrative work is left in the hands\r\n  of the _maire_ and his adjuncts, the full council meeting\r\n  comparatively seldom. The _maire_ and the adjuncts receive no salary.\r\n\r\n  Further information will be found in the sections on local government\r\n  in the articles on the various countries; see also A. Shaw, _Municipal\r\n  Government in Continental Europe_; J. A. Fairlie, _Municipal\r\n  Administration_; S. and B. Webb, _English Local Government_; Redlich\r\n  and Hirst, _Local Government in England_; A. L. Lowell, _The\r\n  Government of England_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] If a place was of mercantile importance it was called a port\r\n    (from _porta_, the city gate), and the reeve or bailiff, a\r\n    \"portreeve.\"\r\n\r\n  [2] The mayors of certain cities in the United Kingdom (London, York,\r\n    Dublin) have acquired by prescription the prefix of \"lord.\" In the\r\n    case of London it seems to date from 1540. It has also been conferred\r\n    during the closing years of the 19th century by letters patent on\r\n    other cities--Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield,\r\n    Leeds, Cardiff, Bradford, Newcastle-on-Tyne, Belfast, Cork. In 1910\r\n    it was granted to Norwich. Lord mayors are entitled to be addressed\r\n    as \"right honourable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYOR OF THE PALACE.--The office of mayor of the palace was an\r\ninstitution peculiar to the Franks of the Merovingian period. A\r\nlandowner who did not manage his own estate placed it in the hands of a\r\nsteward (_major_), who superintended the working of the estate and\r\ncollected its revenues. If he had several estates, he appointed a chief\r\nsteward, who managed the whole of the estates and was called the _major\r\ndomus_. Each great personage had a _major domus_--the queen had hers,\r\nthe king his; and since the royal house was called the palace, this\r\nofficer took the name of \"mayor of the palace.\" The mayor of the palace,\r\nhowever, did not remain restricted to domestic functions; he had the\r\ndiscipline of the palace and tried persons who resided there. Soon his\r\nfunctions expanded. If the king were a minor, the mayor of the palace\r\nsupervised his education in the capacity of guardian (_nutricius_), and\r\noften also occupied himself with affairs of state. When the king came of\r\nage, the mayor exerted himself to keep this power, and succeeded. In the\r\n7th century he became the head of the administration and a veritable\r\nprime minister. He took part in the nomination of the counts and dukes;\r\nin the king's absence he presided over the royal tribunal; and he often\r\ncommanded the armies. When the custom of commendation developed, the\r\nking charged the mayor of the palace to protect those who had commended\r\nthemselves to him and to intervene at law on their behalf. The mayor of\r\nthe palace thus found himself at the head of the _commendati_, just as\r\nhe was at the head of the functionaries.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to trace the names of some of the mayors of the palace,\r\nthe post being of almost no significance in the time of Gregory of\r\nTours. When the office increased in importance the mayors of the palace\r\ndid not, as has been thought, pursue an identical policy. Some--for\r\ninstance, Otto, the mayor of the palace of Austrasia towards 640--were\r\ndevoted to the Crown. On the other hand, mayors like Flaochat (in\r\nBurgundy) and Erkinoald (in Neustria) stirred up the great nobles, who\r\nclaimed the right to take part in their nomination, against the king.\r\nOthers again, sought to exercise the power in their own name both\r\nagainst the king and against the great nobles--such as Ebroïn (in\r\nNeustria), and, later, the Carolingians Pippin II., Charles Martel, and\r\nPippin III., who, after making use of the great nobles, kept the\r\nauthority for themselves. In 751 Pippin III., fortified by his\r\nconsultation with Pope Zacharias, could quite naturally exchange the\r\ntitle of mayor for that of king; and when he became king, he suppressed\r\nthe title of mayor of the palace. It must be observed that from 639\r\nthere were generally separate mayors of Neustria, Austrasia and\r\nBurgundy, even when Austrasia and Burgundy formed a single kingdom; the\r\nmayor was a sign of the independence of the region. Each mayor, however,\r\nsought to supplant the others; the Pippins and Charles Martel succeeded,\r\nand their victory was at the same time the victory of Austrasia over\r\nNeustria and Burgundy.\r\n\r\n  See G.

Educated at Amherst, and at Berlin\r\nand Heidelberg, he became assistant professor of economics at Columbia\r\nUniversity in 1877. He was an adjunct professor from 1878 to 1883, when\r\nhe was appointed professor of political economy and social science, a\r\npost which he held until his death on the 11th of November 1901. He\r\ndevoted himself especially to the study of statistics, and was\r\nrecognized as one of the foremost authorities on the subject. His works\r\ninclude _Emigration and Immigration_ (1890); _Sociology and Statistics_\r\n(1895), and _Statistics and Economics_ (1899).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYOTTE, one of the Comoro Islands, in the Mozambique Channel between\r\nMadagascar and the African mainland. It has belonged to France since\r\n1843 (see COMORO ISLANDS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYOW, JOHN (1643-1679), English chemist and physiologist, was born in\r\nLondon in May 1643. At the age of fifteen he went up to Wadham College,\r\nOxford, of which he became a scholar a year later, and in 1660 he was\r\nelected to a fellowship at All Souls. He graduated in law (bachelor,\r\n1665, doctor, 1670), but made medicine his profession, and \"became noted\r\nfor his practice therein, especially in the summer time, in the city of\r\nBath.\" In 1678, on the proposal of R. Hooke, he was chosen a fellow of\r\nthe Royal Society. The following year, after a marriage which was \"not\r\naltogether to his content,\" he died in London in September 1679. He\r\npublished at Oxford in 1668 two tracts, on respiration and rickets, and\r\nin 1674 these were reprinted, the former in an enlarged and corrected\r\nform, with three others \"De sal-nitro et spiritu nitro-aereo,\" \"De\r\nrespiratione foetus in utero et ovo,\" and \"De motu musculari et\r\nspiritibus animalibus\" as _Tractatus quinque medico-physici_. The\r\ncontents of this work, which was several times republished and\r\ntranslated into Dutch, German and French, show him to have been an\r\ninvestigator much in advance of his time.\r\n\r\n  Accepting as proved by Boyle's experiments that air is necessary for\r\n  combustion, he showed that fire is supported not by the air as a whole\r\n  but by a \"more active and subtle part of it.\" This part he called\r\n  _spiritus igneo-aereus_, or sometimes _nitro-aereus_; for he\r\n  identified it with one of the constituents of the acid portion of\r\n  nitre which he regarded as formed by the union of fixed alkali with a\r\n  _spiritus acidus_. In combustion the _particulae nitro-aereae_--either\r\n  pre-existent in the thing consumed or supplied by the air--combined\r\n  with the material burnt; as he inferred from his observation that\r\n  antimony, strongly heated with a burning glass, undergoes an increase\r\n  of weight which can be attributed to nothing else but these particles.\r\n  In respiration he argued that the same particles are consumed, because\r\n  he found that when a small animal and a lighted candle were placed in\r\n  a closed vessel full of air the candle first went out and soon\r\n  afterwards the animal died, but if there was no candle present it\r\n  lived twice as long. He concluded that this constituent of the air is\r\n  absolutely necessary for life, and supposed that the lungs separate it\r\n  from the atmosphere and pass it into the blood. It is also necessary,\r\n  he inferred, for all muscular movements, and he thought there was\r\n  reason to believe that the sudden contraction of muscle is produced by\r\n  its combination with other combustible (salino-sulphureous) particles\r\n  in the body; hence the heart, being a muscle, ceases to beat when\r\n  respiration is stopped. Animal heat also is due to the union of\r\n  nitro-aerial particles, breathed in from the air, with the combustible\r\n  particles in the blood, and is further formed by the combination of\r\n  these two sets of particles in muscle during violent exertion. In\r\n  effect, therefore, Mayow--who also gives a remarkably correct\r\n  anatomical description of the mechanism of respiration--preceded\r\n  Priestley and Lavoisier by a century in recognizing the existence of\r\n  oxygen, under the guise of his _spiritus nitro-aereus_, as a separate\r\n  entity distinct from the general mass of the air; he perceived the\r\n  part it plays in combustion and in increasing the weight of the calces\r\n  of metals as compared with metals themselves; and, rejecting the\r\n  common notions of his time that the use of breathing is to cool the\r\n  heart, or assist the passage of the blood from the right to the left\r\n  side of the heart, or merely to agitate it, he saw in inspiration a\r\n  mechanism for introducing oxygen into the body, where it is consumed\r\n  for the production of heat and muscular activity, and even vaguely\r\n  conceived of expiration as an excretory process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYSVILLE, a city and the county-seat of Mason county, Kentucky, U.S.A.,\r\non the Ohio river, 60 m. by rail S.E. of Cincinnati. Pop. (1890) 5358;\r\n(1900) 6423 (1155 negroes); (1910) 6141. It is served by the Louisville\r\n& Nashville, and the Chesapeake & Ohio railways, and by steamboats on\r\nthe Ohio river. Among its principal buildings are the Mason county\r\npublic library (1878), the Federal building and Masonic and Odd Fellows'\r\ntemples. The city lies between the river and a range of hills; at the\r\nback of the hills is a fine farming country, of which tobacco of\r\nexcellent quality is a leading product. There is a large plant of the\r\nAmerican Tobacco Company at Maysville, and among the city's manufactures\r\nare pulleys, ploughs, whisky, flour, lumber, furniture, carriages,\r\ncigars, foundry and machine-shop products, bricks and cotton goods. The\r\ncity is a distributing point for coal and other products brought to it\r\nby Ohio river boats. Formerly it was one of the principal hemp markets\r\nof the country. The place early became a landing point for immigrants to\r\nKentucky, and in 1784 a double log cabin and a blockhouse were erected\r\nhere. It was then called Limestone, from the creek which flows into the\r\nOhio here, but several years later the present name was adopted in\r\nhonour of John May, who with Simon Kenton laid out the town in 1787, and\r\nwho in 1790 was killed by the Indians. Maysville was incorporated as a\r\ntown in 1787, was chartered as a city in 1833, and became the\r\ncounty-seat in 1848.\r\n\r\n  In 1830, when the question of \"internal improvements\" by the National\r\n  government was an important political issue, Congress passed a bill\r\n  directing the government to aid in building a turnpike road from\r\n  Maysville to Lexington. President Andrew Jackson vetoed the bill on\r\n  the ground that the proposed improvement was a local rather than a\r\n  national one; but one-half the capital was then furnished privately,\r\n  the other half was furnished through several state appropriations, and\r\n  the road was completed in 1835 and marked the beginning of a system of\r\n  turnpike roads built with state aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZAGAN (_El Jadida_), a port on the Atlantic coast of Morocco in 33°\r\n16´ N. 8° 26´ W. Pop. (1908), about 12,000, of whom a fourth are Jews\r\nand some 400 Europeans. It is the port for Marrákesh, from which it is\r\n110 m. nearly due north, and also for the fertile province of Dukálla.\r\nMazagan presents from the sea a very un-Moorish appearance; it has\r\nmassive Portuguese walls of hewn stone. The exports, which include\r\nbeans, almonds, maize, chick-peas, wool, hides, wax, eggs, &c., were\r\nvalued at £360,000 in 1900, £364,000 in 1904, and £248,000 in 1906. The\r\nimports (cotton goods, sugar, tea, rice, &c.) were valued at £280,000 in\r\n1900, £286,000 in 1904, and £320,000 in 1906. About 46% of the trade is\r\nwith Great Britain and 34% with France. Mazagan was built in 1506 by the\r\nPortuguese, who abandoned it to the Moors in 1769 and established a\r\ncolony, New Mazagan, on the shores of Para in Brazil.\r\n\r\n  See A. H. Dyé, \"Les ports du Maroc\" in _Bull. Soc. Geog. Comm. Paris_,\r\n  xxx. 325-332 (1908), and British consular reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZAMET, an industrial town of south-western France in the department of\r\nTarn, 41 m. S.S.E. of Albi by rail. Pop. (1906), town, 11,370; commune,\r\n14,386. Mazamet is situated on the northern slope of the Montagnes\r\nNoires and on the Arnette, a small sub-tributary of the Agout. Numerous\r\nestablishments are employed in wool-spinning and in the manufacture of\r\n\"swan-skins\" and flannels, and clothing for troops, and hosiery, and\r\nthere are important tanneries and leather-dressing, glove and dye works.\r\nExtensive commerce is carried on in wool and raw hides from Argentina,\r\nAustralia and Cape Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZANDARAN, a province of northern Persia, lying between the Caspian Sea\r\nand the Elburz range, and bounded E. and W. by the provinces of\r\nAstarabad and Gilan respectively, 220 m. in length and 60 m. in (mean)\r\nbreadth, with an area of about 10,000 sq. m. and a population estimated\r\nat from 150,000 to 200,000. Mazandaran comprises two distinct natural\r\nregions presenting the sharpest contrasts in their relief, climate and\r\nproducts. In the north the Caspian is encircled by the level and swampy\r\nlowlands, varying in breadth from 10 to 30 m., partly under impenetrable\r\njungle, partly under rice, cotton, sugar and other crops. This section\r\nis fringed northwards by the sandy beach of the Caspian, here almost\r\ndestitute of natural harbours, and rises somewhat abruptly inland to the\r\nsecond section, comprising the northern slopes and spurs of the Elburz,\r\nwhich approach at some points within 1 or 2 m. of the sea, and are\r\nalmost everywhere covered with dense forest. The lowlands, rising but a\r\nfew feet above the Caspian, and subject to frequent floodings, are\r\nextremely malarious, while the highlands, culminating with the\r\nmagnificent Demavend (19,400 ft.), enjoy a tolerably healthy climate.\r\nBut the climate, generally hot and moist in summer, is everywhere\r\ncapricious and liable to sudden changes of temperature, whence the\r\nprevalence of rheumatism, dropsy and especially ophthalmia, noticed by\r\nall travellers. Snow falls heavily in the uplands, where it often lies\r\nfor weeks on the ground. The direction of the long sandbanks at the\r\nriver mouths, which project with remarkable uniformity from west to\r\neast, shows that the prevailing winds blow from the west and north-west.\r\nThe rivers themselves, of which there are as many as fifty, are little\r\nmore than mountain torrents, all rising on the northern slopes of\r\nElburz, flowing mostly in independent channels to the Caspian, and\r\nsubject to sudden freshets and inundations along their lower course. The\r\nchief are the Sardab-rud, Chalus, Herhaz (Lar in its upper course),\r\nBabul, Tejen and Nika, and all are well stocked with trout, salmon\r\n(_azad-mahi_), perch (_safid-mahi_), carp (_kupur_), bream (_subulu_),\r\nsturgeon (_sag-mahi_) and other fish, which with rice form the staple\r\nfood of the inhabitants; the sturgeon supplies the caviare for the\r\nRussian market. Near their mouths the rivers, running counter to the\r\nprevailing winds and waves of the Caspian, form long sand-hills 20 to 30\r\nft. high and about 200 yds. broad, behind which are developed the\r\nso-called _múrd-áb_, or \"dead waters,\" stagnant pools and swamps\r\ncharacteristic of this coast, and a main cause of its unhealthiness.\r\n\r\nThe chief products are rice, cotton, sugar, a little silk, and fruits in\r\ngreat variety, including several kinds of the orange, lemon and citron.\r\nSome of the slopes are covered with extensive thickets of the\r\npomegranate, and the wild vine climbs to a great height round the trunks\r\nof the forest trees. These woodlands are haunted by the tiger, panther,\r\nbear, wolf and wild boar in considerable numbers. Of the domestic\r\nanimals, all remarkable for their small size, the chief are the black,\r\nhumped cattle somewhat resembling the Indian variety, and sheep and\r\ngoats.\r\n\r\n  Kinneir, Fraser and other observers speak unfavourably of the\r\n  Mazandarani people, whom they describe as very ignorant and bigoted,\r\n  arrogant, rudely inquisitive and almost insolent towards strangers.\r\n  The peasantry, however, are far from dull, and betray much shrewdness\r\n  where their interests are concerned. In the healthy districts they are\r\n  stout and well made, and are considered a warlike race, furnishing\r\n  some cavalry (800 men) and eight battalions of infantry (5600 men) to\r\n  government. They speak a marked Persian dialect, but a Turki idiom\r\n  closely akin to the Turkoman is still current amongst the tribes,\r\n  although they have mostly already passed from the nomad to the settled\r\n  state. Of these tribes the most numerous are the Modaunlu, Khojehvand\r\n  and Abdul Maleki, originally of Lek or Kurd stock, besides branches of\r\n  the royal Afshar and Kajar tribes of Turki descent. All these are\r\n  exempt from taxes in consideration of their military service.\r\n\r\n  The export trade is chiefly with Russia from Meshed-i-Sar, the\r\n  principal port of the province, to Baku, where European goods are\r\n  taken in exchange for the white and coloured calicoes, caviare, rice,\r\n  fruits and raw cotton of Mazandaran. Great quantities of rice are also\r\n  exported to the interior of Persia, principally to Teheran and Kazvin.\r\n  Owing to the almost impenetrable character of the country there are\r\n  scarcely any roads accessible to wheeled carriages, and the great\r\n  causeway of Shah Abbas along the coast has in many places even\r\n  disappeared under the jungle. Two routes, however, lead to Teheran,\r\n  one by Firuz Kuh, 180 m. long, the other by Larijan, 144 m. long, both\r\n  in tolerably good repair. Except where crossed by these routes the\r\n  Elburz forms an almost impassable barrier to the south.\r\n\r\n  The administration is in the hands of a governor, who appoints the\r\n  sub-governors of the nine districts of Amol, Barfarush, Meshed-i-Sar,\r\n  Sari, Ashref, Farah-abad, Tunakabun, Kelarrustak and Kujur into which\r\n  the province is divided. There is fair security for life and property;\r\n  and, although otherwise indifferently administered, the country is\r\n  quite free from marauders; but local disturbances have latterly been\r\n  frequent in the two last-named districts. The revenue is about\r\n  £30,000, of which little goes to the state treasury, most being\r\n  required for the governors, troops and pensions. The capital is Sari,\r\n  the other chief towns being Barfarush, Meshed-i-Sar, Ashref and\r\n  Farah-abad.     (A. H.-S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZARIN, JULES (1602-1661), French cardinal and statesman, elder son of\r\na Sicilian, Pietro Mazarini, the intendant of the household of Philip\r\nColonna, and of his wife Ortensia Buffalini, a connexion of the\r\nColonnas, was born at Piscina in the Abruzzi on the 14th of July 1602.\r\nHe was educated by the Jesuits at Rome till his seventeenth year, when\r\nhe accompanied Jerome Colonna as chamberlain to the university of Alcala\r\nin Spain. There he distinguished himself more by his love of gambling\r\nand his gallant adventures than by study, but made himself a thorough\r\nmaster, not only of the Spanish language and character, but also of that\r\nromantic fashion of Spanish love-making which was to help him greatly in\r\nafter life, when he became the servant of a Spanish queen. On his return\r\nto Rome, about 1622, he took his degree as Doctor _utriusque juris_, and\r\nthen became captain of infantry in the regiment of Colonna, which took\r\npart in the war in the Valtelline. During this war he gave proofs of\r\nmuch diplomatic ability, and Pope Urban VIII. entrusted him, in 1629,\r\nwith the difficult task of putting an end to the war of the Mantuan\r\nsuccession. His success marked him out for further distinction. He was\r\npresented to two canonries in the churches of St John Lateran and Sta\r\nMaria Maggiore, although he had only taken the minor orders, and had\r\nnever been consecrated priest; he negotiated the treaty of Turin between\r\nFrance and Savoy in 1632, became vice-legate at Avignon in 1634, and\r\nnuncio at the court of France from 1634 to 1636. But he began to wish\r\nfor a wider sphere than papal negotiations, and, seeing that he had no\r\nchance of becoming a cardinal except by the aid of some great power, he\r\naccepted Richelieu's offer of entering the service of the king of\r\nFrance, and in 1639 became a naturalized Frenchman.\r\n\r\nIn 1640 Richelieu sent him to Savoy, where the regency of Christine, the\r\nduchess of Savoy, and sister of Louis XIII., was disputed by her\r\nbrothers-in-law, the princes Maurice and Thomas of Savoy, and he\r\nsucceeded not only in firmly establishing Christine but in winning over\r\nthe princes to France. This great service was rewarded by his promotion\r\nto the rank of cardinal on the presentation of the king of France in\r\nDecember 1641. On the 4th of December 1642 Cardinal Richelieu died, and\r\non the very next day the king sent a circular letter to all officials\r\nordering them to send in their reports to Cardinal Mazarin, as they had\r\nformerly done to Cardinal Richelieu. Mazarin was thus acknowledged\r\nsupreme minister, but he still had a difficult part to play. The king\r\nevidently could not live long, and to preserve power he must make\r\nhimself necessary to the queen, who would then be regent, and do this\r\nwithout arousing the suspicions of the king or the distrust of the\r\nqueen. His measures were ably taken, and when the king died, on the 14th\r\nof May 1643, to everyone's surprise her husband's minister remained the\r\nqueen's. The king had by a royal edict cumbered the queen-regent with a\r\ncouncil and other restrictions, and it was necessary to get the\r\nparlement of Paris to overrule the edict and make the queen absolute\r\nregent, which was done with the greatest complaisance. Now that the\r\nqueen was all-powerful, it was expected she would at once dismiss\r\nMazarin and summon her own friends to power. One of them, Potier, bishop\r\nof Beauvais, already gave himself airs as prime minister, but Mazarin\r\nhad had the address to touch both the queen's heart by his Spanish\r\ngallantry and her desire for her son's glory by his skilful policy\r\nabroad, and he found himself able easily to overthrow the clique of\r\nImportants, as they were called. That skilful policy was shown in every\r\narena on which the great Thirty Years' War was being fought out. Mazarin\r\nhad inherited the policy of France during the Thirty Years' War from\r\nRichelieu. He had inherited his desire for the humiliation of the house\r\nof Austria in both its branches, his desire to push the French frontier\r\nto the Rhine and maintain a counterpoise of German states against\r\nAustria, his alliances with the Netherlands and with Sweden, and his\r\nfour theatres of war--on the Rhine, in Flanders, in Italy and in\r\nCatalonia.\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years of the great war it was Mazarin alone who\r\ndirected the French diplomacy of the period. He it was who made the\r\npeace of Brömsebro between the Danes and the Swedes, and turned the\r\nlatter once again against the empire; he it was who sent Lionne to make\r\nthe peace of Castro, and combine the princes of North Italy against the\r\nSpaniards, and who made the peace of Ulm between France and Bavaria,\r\nthus detaching the emperor's best ally. He made one fatal mistake--he\r\ndreamt of the French frontier being the Rhine and the Scheldt, and that\r\na Spanish princess might bring the Spanish Netherlands as dowry to Louis\r\nXIV. This roused the jealousy of the United Provinces, and they made a\r\nseparate peace with Spain in January 1648; but the valour of the French\r\ngenerals made the skill of the Spanish diplomatists of no avail, for\r\nTurenne's victory at Zusmarshausen, and Condé's at Lens, caused the\r\npeace of Westphalia to be definitely signed in October 1648. This\r\ncelebrated treaty belongs rather to the history of Germany than to a\r\nlife of Mazarin; but two questions have been often asked, whether\r\nMazarin did not delay the peace as long as possible in order to more\r\ncompletely ruin Germany, and whether Richelieu would have made a similar\r\npeace. To the first question Mazarin's letters, published by M. Chéruel,\r\nprove a complete negative, for in them appears the zeal of Mazarin for\r\nthe peace. On the second point, Richelieu's letters in many places\r\nindicate that his treatment of the great question of frontier would have\r\nbeen more thorough, but then he would not have been hampered in France\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAt home Mazarin's policy lacked the strength of Richelieu's. The Frondes\r\nwere largely due to his own fault. The arrest of Broussel threw the\r\npeople on the side of the parlement. His avarice and unscrupulous\r\nplundering of the revenues of the realm, the enormous fortune which he\r\nthus amassed, his supple ways, his nepotism, and the general lack of\r\npublic interest in the great foreign policy of Richelieu, made Mazarin\r\nthe especial object of hatred both by bourgeois and nobles. The\r\nirritation of the latter was greatly Mazarin's own fault; he had tried\r\nconsistently to play off the king's brother Gaston of Orleans against\r\nCondé, and their respective followers against each other, and had also,\r\nas his _carnets_ prove, jealously kept any courtier from getting into\r\nthe good graces of the queen-regent except by his means, so that it was\r\nnot unnatural that the nobility should hate him, while the queen found\r\nherself surrounded by his creatures alone. Events followed each other\r\nquickly; the day of the barricades was followed by the peace of Ruel,\r\nthe peace of Ruel by the arrest of the princes, by the battle of Rethel,\r\nand Mazarin's exile to Brühl before the union of the two Frondes. It was\r\nwhile in exile at Brühl that Mazarin saw the mistake he had made in\r\nisolating himself and the queen, and that his policy of balancing every\r\nparty in the state against each other had made every party distrust him.\r\nSo by his counsel the queen, while nominally in league with De Retz and\r\nthe parliamentary Fronde, laboured to form a purely royal party, wearied\r\nby civil dissensions, who should act for her and her son's interest\r\nalone, under the leadership of Mathieu Molé, the famous premier\r\npresident of the parlement of Paris. The new party grew in strength, and\r\nin January 1652, after exactly a year's absence, Mazarin returned to the\r\ncourt. Turenne had now become the royal general, and out-manoeuvred\r\nCondé, while the royal party at last grew to such strength in Paris that\r\nCondé had to leave the capital and France. In order to promote a\r\nreconciliation with the parlement of Paris Mazarin had again retired\r\nfrom court, this time to Sedan, in August 1652, but he returned finally\r\nin February 1653. Long had been the trial, and greatly had Mazarin been\r\nto blame in allowing the Frondes to come into existence, but he had\r\nretrieved his position by founding that great royal party which steadily\r\ngrew until Louis XIV. could fairly have said \"L'État, c'est moi.\" As the\r\nwar had progressed, Mazarin had steadily followed Richelieu's policy of\r\nweakening the nobles on their country estates. Whenever he had an\r\nopportunity he destroyed a feudal castle, and by destroying the towers\r\nwhich commanded nearly every town in France, he freed such towns as\r\nBourges, for instance, from their long practical subjection to the\r\nneighbouring great lord.\r\n\r\nThe Fronde over, Mazarin had to build up afresh the power of France at\r\nhome and abroad. It is to his shame that he did so little at home.\r\nBeyond destroying the brick-and-mortar remains of feudalism, he did\r\nnothing for the people. But abroad his policy was everywhere successful,\r\nand opened the way for the policy of Louis XIV. He at first, by means of\r\nan alliance with Cromwell, recovered the north-western cities of France,\r\nthough at the price of yielding Dunkirk to the Protector. On the Baltic,\r\nFrance guaranteed the Treaty of Oliva between her old allies Sweden,\r\nPoland and Brandenburg, which preserved her influence in that quarter.\r\nIn Germany he, through Hugues de Lionne, formed the league of the Rhine,\r\nby which the states along the Rhine bound themselves under the headship\r\nof France to be on their guard against the house of Austria. By such\r\nmeasures Spain was induced to sue for peace, which was finally signed in\r\nthe Isle of Pheasants on the Bidassoa, and is known as the Treaty of the\r\nPyrenees. By it Spain recovered Franche Comté, but ceded to France\r\nRoussillon, and much of French Flanders; and, what was of greater\r\nultimate importance to Europe, Louis XIV. was to marry a Spanish\r\nprincess, who was to renounce her claims to the Spanish succession if\r\nher dowry was paid, which Mazarin knew could not happen at present from\r\nthe emptiness of the Spanish exchequer. He returned to Paris in\r\ndeclining health, and did not long survive the unhealthy sojourn on the\r\nBidassoa; after some political instruction to his young master he passed\r\naway at Vincennes on the 9th of March 1661, leaving a fortune estimated\r\nat from 18 to 40 million livres behind him, and his nieces married into\r\nthe greatest families of France and Italy.\r\n\r\n  The man who could have had such success, who could have made the\r\n  Treaties of Westphalia and the Pyrenees, who could have weathered the\r\n  storm of the Fronde, and left France at peace with itself and with\r\n  Europe to Louis XIV., must have been a great man; and historians,\r\n  relying too much on the brilliant memoirs of his adversaries, like De\r\n  Retz, are apt to rank him too low. That he had many a petty fault\r\n  there can be no doubt; that he was avaricious and double-dealing was\r\n  also undoubted; and his _carnets_ show to what unworthy means he had\r\n  recourse to maintain his influence over the queen. What that influence\r\n  was will be always debated, but both his _carnets_ and the Brühl\r\n  letters show that a real personal affection, amounting to passion on\r\n  the queen's part, existed. Whether they were ever married may be\r\n  doubted; but that hypothesis is made more possible by M. Chéruel's\r\n  having been able to prove from Mazarin's letters that the cardinal\r\n  himself had never taken more than the minor orders, which could always\r\n  be thrown off. With regard to France he played a more patriotic part\r\n  than Condé or Turenne, for he never treated with the Spaniards, and\r\n  his letters show that in the midst of his difficulties he followed\r\n  with intense eagerness every movement on the frontiers. It is that\r\n  immense mass of letters that prove the real greatness of the\r\n  statesman, and disprove De Retz's portrait, which is carefully\r\n  arranged to show off his enemy against the might of Richelieu. To\r\n  concede that the master was the greater man and the greater statesman\r\n  does not imply that Mazarin was but a foil to his predecessor. It is\r\n  true that we find none of those deep plans for the internal prosperity\r\n  of France which shine through Richelieu's policy. Mazarin was not a\r\n  Frenchman, but a citizen of the world, and always paid most attention\r\n  to foreign affairs; in his letters all that could teach a diplomatist\r\n  is to be found, broad general views of policy, minute details\r\n  carefully elaborated, keen insight into men's characters, cunning\r\n  directions when to dissimulate or when to be frank. Italian though he\r\n  was by birth, education and nature, France owed him a great debt for\r\n  his skilful management during the early years of Louis XIV., and the\r\n  king owed him yet more, for he had not only transmitted to him a\r\n  nation at peace, but had educated for him his great servants Le\r\n  Tellier, Lionne and Colbert. Literary men owed him also much; not only\r\n  did he throw his famous library open to them, but he pensioned all\r\n  their leaders, including Descartes, Vincent Voiture (1598-1648), Jean\r\n  Louis Guez de Balzac (1597-1654) and Pierre Corneille. The last-named\r\n  applied, with an adroit allusion to his birthplace, in the dedication\r\n  of his _Pompée_, the line of Virgil:--\r\n\r\n    \"Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento.\"     (H.

Owing to the importance of the military cantonment of\r\nTakhtapul, and its religious sanctity, it has long ago supplanted the\r\nmore ancient capital of Balkh. It is situated in a malarious, almost\r\ndesert plain, 9 m. E. of Balkh, and 30 m. S. of the Pata Kesar ferry on\r\nthe Oxus river. In this neighbourhood is concentrated most of the Afghan\r\narmy north of the Hindu Kush mountains, the fortified cantonment of\r\nDehdadi having been completed by Sirdar Ghulam Ali Khan and incorporated\r\nwith Mazar. Mazar-i-Sharif also contains a celebrated mosque, from which\r\nthe town takes its name. It is a huge ornate building with minarets and\r\na lofty cupola faced with shining blue tiles. It was built by Sultan Ali\r\nMirza about A.D. 1420, and is held in great veneration by all\r\nMussulmans, and especially by Shiites, because it is supposed to be the\r\ntomb of Ali, the son-in-law of Mahomet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZARRÓN, a town of eastern Spain, in the province of Murcia, 19 m. W.\r\nof Cartagena. Pop. (1900), 23,284. There are soap and flour mills and\r\nmetallurgic factories in the town, and iron, copper and lead mines in\r\nthe neighbouring Sierra de Almenara. A railway 5 m. long unites Mazarron\r\nto its port on the Mediterranean, where there is a suburb with 2500\r\ninhabitants (mostly engaged in fisheries and coasting trade), containing\r\nbarracks, a custom-house, and important leadworks. Outside of the suburb\r\nthere are saltpans, most of the proceeds of which are exported to\r\nGalicia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZATLÁN, a city and port of the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, 120 m.\r\n(direct) W.S.W. of the city of Durango, in lat. 23° 12´ N., long 106°\r\n24´ W. Pop. (1895), 15,852; (1900), 17,852. It is the Pacific coast\r\nterminus of the International railway which crosses northern Mexico from\r\nCiudad Porfirio Diaz, and a port of call for the principal steamship\r\nlines on this coast. The harbour is spacious, but the entrance is\r\nobstructed by a bar. The city is built on a small peninsula. Its public\r\nbuildings include a fine town-hall, chamber of commerce, a custom-house\r\nand two hospitals, besides which there is a nautical school and a\r\nmeteorological station, one of the first established in Mexico. The\r\nharbour is provided with a sea-wall at Olas Altas. A government wireless\r\ntelegraph service is maintained between Mazatlán and La Paz, Lower\r\nCalifornia. Among the manufactures are saw-mills, foundries, cotton\r\nfactories and ropeworks, and the exports are chiefly hides, ixtle, dried\r\nand salted fish, gold, silver and copper (bars and ores), fruit, rubber,\r\ntortoise-shell, and gums and resins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZE, a network of winding paths, a labyrinth (q.v.). The word means\r\nproperly a state of confusion or wonder, and is probably of Scandinavian\r\norigin; cf. Norw. _mas_, exhausting labour, also chatter, _masa_, to be\r\nbusy, also to worry, annoy; Swed. _masa_, to lounge, move slowly and\r\nlazily, to dream, muse. Skeat (_Etym._ Dict.) takes the original sense\r\nto be probably \"to be lost in thought,\" \"to dream,\" and connects with\r\nthe root _ma-man_-, to think, cf. \"mind,\" \"man,\" &c. The word \"maze\"\r\nrepresents the addition of an intensive suffix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZEPA-KOLEDINSKY, IVAN STEPANOVICH (1644?-1709), hetman of the\r\nCossacks, belonging to a noble Orthodox family, was born possibly at\r\nMazeptsina, either in 1629 or 1644, the latter being the more probable\r\ndate. He was educated at the court of the Polish king, John Casimir, and\r\ncompleted his studies abroad. An intrigue with a Polish married lady\r\nforced him to fly into the Ukraine. There is a trustworthy tradition\r\nthat the infuriated husband tied the naked youth to the back of a wild\r\nhorse and sent him forth into the steppe. He was rescued and cared for\r\nby the Dnieperian Cossacks, and speedily became one of their ablest\r\nleaders. In 1687, during a visit to Moscow, he won the favour of the\r\nthen all-powerful Vasily Golitsuin, from whom he virtually purchased the\r\nhetmanship of the Cossacks (July 25). He took a very active part in the\r\nAzov campaigns of Peter the Great and won the entire confidence of the\r\nyoung tsar by his zeal and energy. He was also very serviceable to Peter\r\nat the beginning of the Great Northern War, especially in 1705 and 1706,\r\nwhen he took part in the Volhynian campaign and helped to construct the\r\nfortress of Pechersk. The power and influence of Mazepa were fully\r\nrecognized by Peter the Great. No other Cossack hetman had ever been\r\ntreated with such deference at Moscow. He ranked with the highest\r\ndignitaries in the state; he sat at the tsar's own table. He had been\r\nmade one of the first cavaliers of the newly established order of St\r\nAndrew, and Augustus of Poland had bestowed upon him, at Peter's earnest\r\nsolicitation, the universally coveted order of the White Eagle. Mazepa\r\nhad no temptations to be anything but loyal, and loyal he would\r\ndoubtless have remained had not Charles XII. crossed the Russian\r\nfrontier. Then it was that Mazepa, who had had doubts of the issue of\r\nthe struggle all along, made up his mind that Charles, not Peter, was\r\ngoing to win, and that it was high time he looked after his own\r\ninterests. Besides, he had his personal grievances against the tsar. He\r\ndid not like the new ways because they interfered with his old ones. He\r\nwas very jealous of the favourite (Menshikov), whom he suspected of a\r\ndesign to supplant him. But he proceeded very cautiously. Indeed, he\r\nwould have preferred to remain neutral, but he was not strong enough to\r\nstand alone. The crisis came when Peter ordered him to co-operate\r\nactively with the Russian forces in the Ukraine. At this very time he\r\nwas in communication with Charles's first minister, Count Piper, and had\r\nagreed to harbour the Swedes in the Ukraine and close it against the\r\nRussians (Oct. 1708). The last doubt disappeared when Menshikov was sent\r\nto supervise Mazepa. At the approach of his rival the old hetman\r\nhastened to the Swedish outposts at Horki, in Severia. Mazepa's treason\r\ntook Peter completely by surprise. He instantly commanded Menshikov to\r\nget a new hetman elected and raze Baturin, Mazepa's chief stronghold in\r\nthe Ukraine, to the ground. When Charles, a week later, passed Baturin\r\nby, all that remained of the Cossack capital was a heap of smouldering\r\nmills and ruined houses. The total destruction of Baturin, almost in\r\nsight of the Swedes, overawed the bulk of the Cossacks into obedience,\r\nand Mazepa's ancient prestige was ruined in a day when the metropolitan\r\nof Kiev solemnly excommunicated him from the high altar, and his effigy,\r\nafter being dragged with contumely through the mud at Kiev, was publicly\r\nburnt by the common hangman. Henceforth Mazepa, perforce, attached\r\nhimself to Charles. What part he took at the battle of Poltava is not\r\nquite clear. After the catastrophe he accompanied Charles to Turkey with\r\nsome 1500 horsemen (the miserable remnant of his 80,000 warriors). The\r\nsultan refused to surrender him to the tsar, though Peter offered\r\n300,000 ducats for his head. He died at Bender on the 22nd of August\r\n1709.\r\n\r\n  See N. I. Kostomarov, _Mazepa and the Mazepanites_ (Russ.) (St\r\n  Petersburg), 1885; R. Nisbet Bain, _The First Romanovs_ (London,\r\n  1905); S. M. Solovev, _History of Russia_ (Russ.), vol. xv. (St\r\n  Petersburg, 1895).     (R. N. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZER, the name of a special type of drinking vessel, properly made of\r\nmaple-wood, and so-called from the spotted or \"birds-eye\" marking on the\r\nwood (Ger. _Maser_, spot, marking, especially on wood; cf. \"measles\").\r\nThese drinking vessels are shallow bowls without handles, with a broad\r\nflat foot and a knob or boss in the centre of the inside, known\r\ntechnically as the \"print.\" They were made from the 13th to the 16th\r\ncenturies, and were the most prized of the various wooden cups in use,\r\nand so were ornamented with a rim of precious metal, generally of silver\r\nor silver gilt; the foot and the \"print\" being also of metal. The depth\r\nof the mazers seems to have decreased in course of time, those of the\r\n16th century that survive being much shallower than the earlier\r\nexamples. There are examples with wooden covers with a metal handle,\r\nsuch as the Flemish and German mazers in the Franks Bequest in the\r\nBritish Museum. On the metal rim is usually an inscription, religious or\r\nbacchanalian, and the \"print\" was also often decorated. The later mazers\r\nsometimes had metal straps between the rim and the foot.\r\n\r\n  A very fine mazer with silver gilt ornamentation 3 in. deep and 9½ in.\r\n  in diameter was sold in the Braikenridge collection in 1908 for £2300.\r\n  It bears the London hall-mark of 1534.

Mommsen in _Corpus inscr. lat._ (Berlin, 1883), x. 739.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZZINI, GIUSEPPE (1805-1872), Italian patriot, was born on the 22nd of\r\nJune 1805 at Genoa, where his father, Giacomo Mazzini, was a physician\r\nin good practice, and a professor in the university. His mother is\r\ndescribed as having been a woman of great personal beauty, as well as of\r\nactive intellect and strong affections. During infancy and childhood his\r\nhealth was extremely delicate, and it appears that he was nearly six\r\nyears of age before he was quite able to walk; but he had already begun\r\nto devour books of all kinds and to show other signs of great\r\nintellectual precocity. He studied Latin with his first tutor, an old\r\npriest, but no one directed his extensive course of reading. He became a\r\nstudent at the university of Genoa at an unusually early age, and\r\nintended to follow his father's profession, but being unable to conquer\r\nhis horror of practical anatomy, he decided to graduate in law (1826).\r\nHis exceptional abilities, together with his remarkable generosity,\r\nkindness and loftiness of character, endeared him to his fellow\r\nstudents. As to his inner life during this period, we have only one\r\nbrief but significant sentence; \"for a short time,\" he says, \"my mind\r\nwas somewhat tainted by the doctrines of the foreign materialistic\r\nschool; but the study of history and the intuitions of conscience--the\r\nonly tests of truth--soon led me back to the spiritualism of our Italian\r\nfathers.\"\r\n\r\nThe natural bent of his genius was towards literature, and, in the\r\ncourse of the four years of his nominal connexion with the legal\r\nprofession, he wrote a considerable number of essays and reviews, some\r\nof which have been wholly or partially reproduced in the critical and\r\nliterary volumes of his _Life and Writings_. His first essay,\r\ncharacteristically enough on \"Dante's Love of Country,\" was sent to the\r\neditor of the _Antologia fiorentina_ in 1826, but did not appear until\r\nsome years afterwards in the _Subalpino_. He was an ardent supporter of\r\nromanticism as against what he called \"literary servitude under the name\r\nof classicism\"; and in this interest all his critiques (as, for example,\r\nthat of Giannoni's \"Exile\" in the _Indicatore Livornese_, 1829) were\r\npenned. But in the meantime the \"republican instincts\" which he tells us\r\nhe had inherited from his mother had been developing, and his sense of\r\nthe evils under which Italy was groaning had been intensified; and at\r\nthe same time he became possessed with the idea that Italians, and he\r\nhimself in particular, \"_could_ and therefore _ought_ to struggle for\r\nliberty of country.\" Therefore, he at once put aside his dearest\r\nambition, that of producing a complete history of religion, developing\r\nhis scheme of a new theology uniting the spiritual with the practical\r\nlife, and devoted himself to political thought. His literary articles\r\naccordingly became more and more suggestive of advanced liberalism in\r\npolitics, and led to the suppression by government of the _Indicatore\r\nGenovese_ and the _Indicatore Livornese_ successively. Having joined the\r\nCarbonari, he soon rose to one of the higher grades in their hierarchy,\r\nand was entrusted with a special secret mission into Tuscany; but, as\r\nhis acquaintance grew, his dissatisfaction with the organization of the\r\nsociety increased, and he was already meditating the formation of a new\r\nassociation stripped of foolish mysterious and theatrical formulae,\r\nwhich instead of merely combating existing authorities should have a\r\ndefinite and purely patriotic aim, when shortly after the French\r\nrevolution of 1830 he was betrayed, while initiating a new member, to\r\nthe Piedmontese authorities. He was imprisoned in the fortress of Savona\r\non the western Riviera for about six months, when, a conviction having\r\nbeen found impracticable through deficiency of evidence, he was\r\nreleased, but upon conditions involving so many restrictions of his\r\nliberty that he preferred the alternative of leaving the country. He\r\nwithdrew accordingly into France, living chiefly in Marseilles.\r\n\r\nWhile in his lonely cell at Savona, in presence of \"those symbols of the\r\ninfinite, the sky and the sea,\" with a greenfinch for his sole\r\ncompanion, and having access to no books but \"a Tacitus, a Byron, and a\r\nBible,\" he had finally become aware of the great mission or \"apostolate\"\r\n(as he himself called it) of his life; and soon after his release his\r\nprison meditations took shape in the programme of the organization which\r\nwas destined soon to become so famous throughout Europe, that of _La\r\nGiovine Italia_, or Young Italy. Its publicly avowed aims were to be the\r\nliberation of Italy both from foreign and domestic tyranny, and its\r\nunification under a republican form of government; the means to be used\r\nwere education, and, where advisable, insurrection by guerrilla bands;\r\nthe motto was to be \"God and the people,\" and the banner was to bear on\r\none side the words \"Unity\" and \"Independence\" and on the other\r\n\"Liberty,\" \"Equality,\" and \"Humanity,\" to describe respectively the\r\nnational and the international aims. In April 1831 Charles Albert, \"the\r\nex-Carbonaro conspirator of 1821,\" succeeded Charles Felix on the\r\nSardinian throne, and towards the close of that year Mazzini, making\r\nhimself, as he afterwards confessed, \"the interpreter of a hope which he\r\ndid not share,\" wrote the new king a letter, published at Marseilles,\r\nurging him to take the lead in the impending struggle for Italian\r\nindependence. Clandestinely reprinted, and rapidly circulated all over\r\nItaly, its bold and outspoken words produced a great sensation, but so\r\ndeep was the offence it gave to the Sardinian government that orders\r\nwere issued for the immediate arrest and imprisonment of the author\r\nshould he attempt to cross the frontier. Towards the end of the same\r\nyear appeared the important Young Italy \"Manifesto,\" the substance of\r\nwhich is given in the first volume of the _Life and Writings_ of\r\nMazzini; and this was followed soon afterwards by the society's\r\n_Journal_, which, smuggled across the Italian frontier, had great\r\nsuccess in the objects for which it was written, numerous\r\n\"congregations\" being formed at Genoa, Leghorn, and elsewhere.\r\nRepresentations were consequently made by the Sardinian to the French\r\ngovernment, which issued in an order for Mazzini's withdrawal from\r\nMarseilles (Aug. 1832); he lingered for a few months in concealment, but\r\nultimately found it necessary to retire into Switzerland.\r\n\r\nFrom this point it is somewhat difficult to follow the career of the\r\nmysterious and terrible conspirator who for twenty years out of the next\r\nthirty led a life of voluntary imprisonment (as he himself tells us)\r\n\"within the four walls of a room,\" and \"kept no record of dates, made no\r\nbiographical notes, and preserved no copies of letters.\" In 1833,\r\nhowever, he is known to have been concerned in an abortive revolutionary\r\nmovement which took place in the Sardinian army; several executions took\r\nplace, and he himself was laid under sentence of death. Before the close\r\nof the same year a similar movement in Genoa had been planned, but\r\nfailed through the youth and inexperience of the leaders. At Geneva,\r\nalso in 1833, Mazzini set on foot _L'Europe Centrale_, a journal of\r\nwhich one of the main objects was the emancipation of Savoy; but he did\r\nnot confine himself to a merely literary agitation for this end. Chiefly\r\nthrough his agency a considerable body of German, Polish and Italian\r\nexiles was organized, and an armed invasion of the duchy planned. The\r\nfrontier was actually crossed on the 1st of February 1834, but the\r\nattack ignominiously broke down without a shot having been fired.\r\nMazzini, who personally accompanied the expedition, is no doubt correct\r\nin attributing the failure to dissensions with the Carbonari leaders in\r\nParis, and to want of a cordial understanding between himself and the\r\nSavoyard Ramorino, who had been chosen as military leader.\r\n\r\nIn April 1834 the \"Young Europe\" association \"of men believing in a\r\nfuture of liberty, equality and fraternity for all mankind, and desirous\r\nof consecrating their thoughts and actions to the realization of that\r\nfuture\" was formed also under the influence of Mazzini's enthusiasm; it\r\nwas followed soon afterwards by a \"Young Switzerland\" society, having\r\nfor its leading idea the formation of an Alpine confederation, to\r\ninclude Switzerland, Tyrol, Savoy and the rest of the Alpine chain as\r\nwell. But _La Jeune Suisse_ newspaper was compelled to stop within a\r\nyear, and in other respects the affairs of the struggling patriot became\r\nembarrassed. He was permitted to remain at Grenchen in Solothurn for a\r\nwhile, but at last the Swiss diet, yielding to strong and persistent\r\npressure from abroad, exiled him about the end of 1836. In January 1837\r\nhe arrived in London, where for many months he had to carry on a hard\r\nfight with poverty and the sense of spiritual loneliness, so touchingly\r\ndescribed by himself in the first volume of the _Life and Writings_.\r\nUltimately, as he gained command of the English language, he began to\r\nearn a livelihood by writing review articles, some of which have since\r\nbeen reprinted, and are of a high order of literary merit; they include\r\npapers on \"Italian Literature since 1830\" and \"Paolo Sarpi\" in the\r\n_Westminster Review_, articles on \"Lamennais,\" \"George Sand,\" \"Byron and\r\nGoethe\" in the _Monthly Chronicle_, and on \"Lamartine,\" \"Carlyle,\" and\r\n\"The Minor Works of Dante\" in the _British and Foreign Review_. In 1839\r\nhe entered into relations with the revolutionary committees sitting in\r\nMalta and Paris, and in 1840 he originated a working men's association,\r\nand the weekly journal entitled _Apostolato Popolare_, in which the\r\nadmirable popular treatise \"On the Duties of Man\" was commenced. Among\r\nthe patriotic and philanthropic labours undertaken by Mazzini during\r\nthis period of retirement in London may be mentioned a free evening\r\nschool conducted by himself and a few others for some years, at which\r\nseveral hundreds of Italian children received at least the rudiments of\r\nsecular and religious education. He also exposed and combated the\r\ninfamous traffic carried on in southern Italy, where scoundrels bought\r\nsmall boys from poverty-stricken parents and carried them off to England\r\nand elsewhere to grind organs and suffer martyrdom at the hands of cruel\r\ntaskmasters.\r\n\r\nThe most memorable episode in his life during the same period was\r\nperhaps that which arose out of the conduct of Sir James Graham, the\r\nhome secretary, in systematically, for some months, opening Mazzini's\r\nletters as they passed through the British post office, and\r\ncommunicating their contents to the Neapolitan government--a proceeding\r\nwhich was believed at the time to have led to the arrest and execution\r\nof the brothers Bandiera, Austrian subjects, who had been planning an\r\nexpedition against Naples, although the recent publication of Sir James\r\nGraham's life seems to exonerate him from the charge. The prolonged\r\ndiscussions in parliament, and the report of the committee appointed to\r\ninquire into the matter, did not, however, lead to any practical result,\r\nunless indeed the incidental vindication of Mazzini's character, which\r\nhad been recklessly assailed in the course of debate. In this connexion\r\nThomas Carlyle wrote to _The Times_: \"I have had the honour to know Mr\r\nMazzini for a series of years, and, whatever I may think of his\r\npractical insight and skill in worldly affairs, I can with great freedom\r\ntestify that he, if I have ever seen one such, is a man of genius and\r\nvirtue, one of those rare men, numerable unfortunately but as units in\r\nthis world, who are worthy to be called martyr souls; who in silence,\r\npiously in their daily life, practise what is meant by that.\"\r\n\r\nMazzini did not share the enthusiastic hopes everywhere raised in the\r\nranks of the Liberal party throughout Europe by the first acts of Pius\r\nIX., in 1846, but at the same time he availed himself, towards the end\r\nof 1847, of the opportunity to publish a letter addressed to the new\r\npope, indicating the nature of the religious and national mission which\r\nthe Liberals expected him to undertake. The leaders of the revolutionary\r\noutbreaks in Milan and Messina in the beginning of 1848 had long been in\r\nsecret correspondence with Mazzini; and their action, along with the\r\nrevolution in Paris, brought him early in the same year to Italy, where\r\nhe took a great and active interest in the events which dragged Charles\r\nAlbert into an unprofitable war with Austria; he actually for a short\r\ntime bore arms under Garibaldi immediately before the reoccupation of\r\nMilan, but ultimately, after vain attempts to maintain the insurrection\r\nin the mountain districts, found it necessary to retire to Lugano. In\r\nthe beginning of the following year he was nominated a member of the\r\nshort-lived provisional government of Tuscany formed after the flight of\r\nthe grand-duke, and almost simultaneously, when Rome had, in consequence\r\nof the withdrawal of Pius IX., been proclaimed a republic, he was\r\ndeclared a member of the constituent assembly there. A month afterwards,\r\nthe battle of Novara having again decided against Charles Albert in the\r\nbrief struggle with Austria, into which he had once more been drawn,\r\nMazzini was appointed a member of the Roman triumvirate, with supreme\r\nexecutive power (March 23, 1849). The opportunity he now had for showing\r\nthe administrative and political ability which he was believed to\r\npossess was more apparent than real, for the approach of the professedly\r\nfriendly French troops soon led to hostilities, and resulted in a siege\r\nwhich terminated, towards the end of June, with the assembly's\r\nresolution to discontinue the defence, and Mazzini's indignant\r\nresignation. That he succeeded, however, for so long a time, and in\r\ncircumstances so adverse, in maintaining a high degree of order within\r\nthe turbulent city is a fact that speaks for itself. His diplomacy,\r\nbacked as it was by no adequate physical force, naturally showed at the\r\ntime to very great disadvantage, but his official correspondence and\r\nproclamations can still be read with admiration and intellectual\r\npleasure, as well as his eloquent vindication of the revolution in his\r\npublished \"Letter to MM. de Tocqueville and de Falloux.\" The surrender\r\nof the city on the 30th of June was followed by Mazzini's not too\r\nprecipitate flight by way of Marseilles into Switzerland, whence he once\r\nmore found his way to London. Here in 1850 he became president of the\r\nNational Italian Committee, and at the same time entered into close\r\nrelations with Ledru-Rollin and Kossuth. He had a firm belief in the\r\nvalue of revolutionary attempts, however hopeless they might seem; he\r\nhad a hand in the abortive rising at Mantua in 1852, and again, in\r\nFebruary 1853, a considerable share in the ill-planned insurrection at\r\nMilan on the 6th of February 1853, the failure of which greatly weakened\r\nhis influence; once more, in 1854, he had gone far with preparations for\r\nrenewed action when his plans were completely disconcerted by the\r\nwithdrawal of professed supporters, and by the action of the French and\r\nEnglish governments in sending ships of war to Naples.\r\n\r\nThe year 1857 found him yet once more in Italy, where, for complicity in\r\nshort-lived émeutes which took place at Genoa, Leghorn and Naples, he\r\nwas again laid under sentence of death. Undiscouraged in the pursuit of\r\nthe one great aim of his life by any such incidents as these, he\r\nreturned to London, where he edited his new journal _Pensiero ed\r\nAzione_, in which the constant burden of his message to the overcautious\r\npractical politicians of Italy was: \"I am but a voice crying _Action_;\r\nbut the state of Italy cries for it also. So do the best men and people\r\nof her cities. Do you wish to destroy my influence? _Act_.\" The same\r\ntone was at a somewhat later date assumed in the letter he wrote to\r\nVictor Emmanuel, urging him to put himself at the head of the movement\r\nfor Italian unity, and promising republican support. As regards the\r\nevents of 1859-1860, however, it may be questioned whether, through his\r\ncharacteristic inability to distinguish between the ideally perfect and\r\nthe practically possible, he did not actually hinder more than he helped\r\nthe course of events by which the realization of so much of the great\r\ndream of his life was at last brought about. If Mazzini was the prophet\r\nof Italian unity, and Garibaldi its knight errant, to Cavour alone\r\nbelongs the honour of having been the statesman by whom it was finally\r\naccomplished. After the irresistible pressure of the popular movement\r\nhad led to the establishment not of an Italian republic but of an\r\nItalian kingdom, Mazzini could honestly enough write, \"I too have\r\nstriven to realize unity under a monarchical flag,\" but candour\r\ncompelled him to add, \"The Italian people are led astray by a delusion\r\nat the present day, a delusion which has induced them to substitute\r\nmaterial for moral unity and their own reorganization. Not so I. I bow\r\nmy head sorrowfully to the sovereignty of the national will; but\r\nmonarchy will never number me amongst its servants or followers.\" In\r\n1865, by way of protest against the still uncancelled sentence of death\r\nunder which he lay, Mazzini was elected by Messina as delegate to the\r\nItalian parliament, but, feeling himself unable to take the oath of\r\nallegiance to the monarchy, he never took his seat. In the following\r\nyear, when a general amnesty was granted after the cession of Venice to\r\nItaly, the sentence of death was at last removed, but he declined to\r\naccept such an \"offer of oblivion and pardon for having loved Italy\r\nabove all earthly things.\" In May 1869 he was again expelled from\r\nSwitzerland at the instance of the Italian government for having\r\nconspired with Garibaldi; after a few months spent in England he set out\r\n(1870) for Sicily, but was promptly arrested at sea and carried to\r\nGaeta, where he was imprisoned for two months. Events soon made it\r\nevident that there was little danger to fear from the contemplated\r\nrising, and the occasion of the birth of a prince was seized for\r\nrestoring him to liberty. The remainder of his life, spent partly in\r\nLondon and partly at Lugano, presents no noteworthy incidents. For some\r\ntime his health had been far from satisfactory, but the immediate cause\r\nof his death was an attack of pleurisy with which he was seized at Pisa,\r\nand which terminated fatally on the 10th of March 1872. The Italian\r\nparliament by a unanimous vote expressed the national sorrow with which\r\nthe tidings of his death had been received, the president pronouncing an\r\neloquent eulogy on the departed patriot as a model of disinterestedness\r\nand self-denial, and one who had dedicated his whole life ungrudgingly\r\nto the cause of his country's freedom. A public funeral took place at\r\nPisa on the 14th of March, and the remains were afterwards conveyed to\r\nGenoa.     (J. S. Bl.)\r\n\r\n  The published writings of Mazzini, mostly occasional, are very\r\n  voluminous. An edition was begun by himself and continued by A. Saffi,\r\n  _Scritti editi e inediti di Giuseppe Mazzini_, in 18 vols. (Milan and\r\n  Rome, 1861-1891); many of the most important are found in the\r\n  partially autobiographical _Life and Writings of Joseph Mazzini_\r\n  (1864-1870) and the two most systematic--_Thoughts upon Democracy in\r\n  Europe_, a remarkable series of criticisms on Benthamism, St\r\n  Simonianism, Fourierism, and other economic and socialistic schools of\r\n  the day, and the treatise _On the Duties of Man_, an admirable primer\r\n  of ethics, dedicated to the Italian working class--will be found in\r\n  _Joseph Mazzini: a Memoir_, by Mrs E. A. Venturi (London, 1875).\r\n  Mazzini's \"first great sacrifice,\" he tells us, was \"the renunciation\r\n  of the career of literature for the more direct path of political\r\n  action,\" and as late as 1861 we find him still recurring to the\r\n  long-cherished hope of being able to leave the stormy arena of\r\n  politics and consecrate the last years of his life to the dream of his\r\n  youth. He had specially contemplated three considerable literary\r\n  undertakings--a volume of _Thoughts on Religion_, a popular _History\r\n  of Italy_, to enable the working classes to apprehend what he\r\n  conceived to be the \"mission\" of Italy in God's providential ordering\r\n  of the world, and a comprehensive collection of translations of\r\n  ancient and modern classics into Italian. None of these was actually\r\n  achieved. No one, however, can read even the briefest and most\r\n  occasional writing of Mazzini without gaining some impression of the\r\n  simple grandeur of the man, the lofty elevation of his moral tone, his\r\n  unwavering faith in the living God, who is ever revealing Himself in\r\n  the progressive development of humanity. His last public utterance is\r\n  to be found in a highly characteristic article on Renan's _Réforme\r\n  Morale et Intellectuelle_, finished on the 3rd of March 1872, and\r\n  published in the _Fortnightly Review_ for February 1874. Of the 40,000\r\n  letters of Mazzini only a small part have been published. In 1887 two\r\n  hundred unpublished letters were printed at Turin (_Duecento lettere\r\n  inedite di Giuseppe Mazzini_), in 1895 the _Lettres intimes_ were\r\n  published in Paris, and in 1905 Francesco Rosso published _Lettre\r\n  inedite di Giuseppe Mazzini_ (Turin, 1905). A popular edition of\r\n  Mazzini's writings has been undertaken by order of the Italian\r\n  government.\r\n\r\n  For Mazzini's biography see Jessie White Mario, _Della vita di\r\n  Giuseppe Mazzini_ (Milan, 1886), a useful if somewhat too enthusiastic\r\n  work; Bolton King, _Mazzini_ (London, 1903); Count von Schack, _Joseph\r\n  Mazzini und die italienische Einheit_ (Stuttgart, 1891). A. Luzio's\r\n  _Giuseppe Mazzini_ (Milan, 1905) contains a great deal of valuable\r\n  information, bibliographical and other, and Dora Melegari in _La\r\n  giovine Italia e Giuseppe Mazzini_ (Milan, 1906) publishes the\r\n  correspondence between Mazzini and Luigi A. Melegari during the early\r\n  days of \"Young Italy.\" For the literary side of Mazzini's life see\r\n  Peretti, _Gli scritti letterarii di Giuseppe Mazzini_ (Turin, 1904).\r\n       (L. V.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZZONI, GIACOMO (1548-1598), Italian philosopher, was born at Cesena\r\nand died at Ferrara. A member of a noble family and highly educated, he\r\nwas one of the most eminent savants of the period. He occupied chairs in\r\nthe universities of Pisa and Rome, was one of the founders of the Della\r\nCrusca Academy, and had the distinction, it is said, of thrice\r\nvanquishing the Admirable Crichton in dialectic. His chief work in\r\nphilosophy was an attempt to reconcile Plato and Aristotle, and in this\r\nspirit he published in 1597 a treatise _In universam Platonis et\r\nAristotelis philosophiam praecludia_. He wrote also _De triplici hominum\r\nvita_, wherein he outlined a theory of the infinite perfection and\r\ndevelopment of nature. Apart from philosophy, he was prominent in\r\nliterature as the champion of Dante, and produced two works in the\r\npoet's defence: _Discorso composto in difesa della comedia di Dante_\r\n(1572), and _Della difesa della comedia di Dante_ (1587, reprinted\r\n1688). He was an authority on ancient languages and philology, and gave\r\na great impetus to the scientific study of the Italian language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZZONI, GUIDO (1859-   ), Italian poet, was born at Florence, and\r\neducated at Pisa and Bologna. In 1887 he became professor of Italian at\r\nPadua, and in 1894 at Florence. He was much influenced by Carducci, and\r\nbecame prominent both as a prolific and well-read critic and as a poet\r\nof individual distinction. His chief volumes of verse are _Versi_\r\n(1880), _Nuove poesie_ (1886), _Poesie_ (1891), _Voci della vita_\r\n(1893).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAD, LARKIN GOLDSMITH (1835-   ), American sculptor, was born at\r\nChesterfield, New Hampshire, on the 3rd of January 1835. He was a pupil\r\n(1853-1855) of Henry Kirke Brown. During the early part of the Civil\r\nWar he was at the front for six months, with the army of the Potomac, as\r\nan artist for _Harper's Weekly_; and in 1862-1865 he was in Italy, being\r\nfor part of the time attached to the United States consulate at Venice,\r\nwhile William D. Howells, his brother-in-law, was consul. He returned to\r\nAmerica in 1865, but subsequently went back to Italy and lived at\r\nFlorence. His first important work was a statue of Ethan Allen, now at\r\nthe State House, Montpelier, Vermont. His principal works are: the\r\nmonument to President Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois; \"Ethan Allen\"\r\n(1876), National Hall of Statuary, Capitol, Washington; an heroic marble\r\nstatue, \"The Father of Waters,\" New Orleans; and \"Triumph of Ceres,\"\r\nmade for the Columbian Exposition, Chicago.\r\n\r\nHis brother, WILLIAM RUTHERFORD MEAD (1846-   ), graduated at Amherst\r\nCollege in 1867, and studied architecture in New York under Russell\r\nSturgis, and also abroad. In 1879 he and J. F. McKim, with whom he had\r\nbeen in partnership for two years as architects, were joined by Stanford\r\nWhite, and formed the well-known firm of McKim, Mead & White.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAD, RICHARD (1673-1754), English physician, eleventh child of Matthew\r\nMead (1630-1699), Independent divine, was born on the 11th of August\r\n1673 at Stepney, London. He studied at Utrecht for three years under J.\r\nG. Graevius; having decided to follow the medical profession, he then\r\nwent to Leiden and attended the lectures of Paul Hermann and Archibald\r\nPitcairne. In 1695 he graduated in philosophy and physic at Padua, and\r\nin 1696 he returned to London, entering at once on a successful\r\npractice. His _Mechanical Account of Poisons_ appeared in 1702, and in\r\n1703 he was admitted to the Royal Society, to whose _Transactions_ he\r\ncontributed in that year a paper on the parasitic nature of scabies. In\r\nthe same year he was elected physician to St Thomas's Hospital, and\r\nappointed to read anatomical lectures at the Surgeons' Hall. On the\r\ndeath of John Radcliffe in 1714 Mead became the recognized head of his\r\nprofession; he attended Queen Anne on her deathbed, and in 1727 was\r\nappointed physician to George II., having previously served him in that\r\ncapacity when he was prince of Wales. He died in London on the 16th of\r\nFebruary 1754.\r\n\r\n  Besides the _Mechanical Account of Poisons_ (2nd ed., 1708), Mead\r\n  published a treatise _De imperio solis et lunae in corpora humana et\r\n  morbis inde oriundis_ (1704), _A Short Discourse concerning\r\n  Pestilential Contagion, and the Method to be used to prevent it_\r\n  (1720), _De variolis et morbillis dissertatio_ (1747), _Medica sacra,\r\n  sive de morbis insignioribus qui in bibliis memorantur commentarius_\r\n  (1748), _On the Scurvy_ (1749), and _Monita et praecepta medica_\r\n  (1751). A _Life_ of Mead by Dr Matthew Maty appeared in 1755.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAD. (1) A word now only used more or less poetically for the commoner\r\nform \"meadow,\" properly land laid down for grass and cut for hay, but\r\noften extended in meaning to include pasture-land. \"Meadow\" represents\r\nthe oblique case, _maédwe_, of O. Eng. _maéd_, which comes from the root\r\nseen in \"mow\"; the word, therefore, means \"mowed land.\" Cognate words\r\nappear in other Teutonic languages, a familiar instance being Ger.\r\n_matt_, seen in place-names such as Zermatt, Andermatt, &c. (See Grass.)\r\n(2) The name of a drink made by the fermentation of honey mixed with\r\nwater. Alcoholic drinks made from honey were common in ancient times,\r\nand during the middle ages throughout Europe. The Greeks and Romans knew\r\nof such under the names of [Greek: hodromeli] and _hydromel_; _mulsum_\r\nwas a form of mead with the addition of wine. The word is common to\r\nTeutonic languages (cf. Du. _mede_, Ger. _Met_ or _Meth_), and is\r\ncognate with Gr. [Greek: methu], wine, and Sansk. _mádhu_, sweet drink.\r\n\"Metheglin,\" another word for mead, properly a medicated or spiced form\r\nof the drink, is an adaptation of the Welsh _meddyglyn_, which is\r\nderived from _meddyg_, healing (Lat. _medicus_) and _llyn_, liquor. It\r\ntherefore means \"spiced or medicated drink,\" and is not etymologically\r\nconnected with \"mead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADE, GEORGE GORDON (1815-1872), American soldier, was born of American\r\nparentage at Cadiz, Spain, on the 31st of December 1815. On graduation\r\nat the United States Military Academy in 1835, he served in Florida with\r\nthe 3rd Artillery against the Seminoles. Resigning from the army in\r\n1836, he became a civil engineer and constructor of railways, and was\r\nengaged under the war department in survey work. In 1842 he was\r\nappointed a second lieutenant in the corps of the topographical\r\nengineers. In the war with Mexico he was on the staffs successively of\r\nGenerals Taylor, J. Worth and Robert Patterson, and was brevetted for\r\ngallant conduct at Monterey. Until the Civil War he was engaged in\r\nvarious engineering works, mainly in connexion with lighthouses, and\r\nlater as a captain of topographical engineers in the survey of the\r\nnorthern lakes. In 1861 he was appointed brigadier-general of\r\nvolunteers, and had command of the 2nd brigade of the Pennsylvania\r\nReserves in the Army of the Potomac under General M'Call. He served in\r\nthe Seven Days, receiving a severe wound at the action of Frazier's\r\nFarm. He was absent from his command until the second battle of Bull\r\nRun, after which he obtained the command of his division. He\r\ndistinguished himself greatly at the battles of South Mountain and\r\nAntietam. At Fredericksburg he and his division won great distinction by\r\ntheir attack on the position held by Jackson's corps, and Meade was\r\npromoted major-general of volunteers, to date from the 29th of November.\r\nSoon afterwards he was placed in command of the V. corps. At\r\nChancellorsville he displayed great intrepidity and energy, and on the\r\neve of the battle of Gettysburg was appointed to succeed Hooker. The\r\nchoice was unexpected, but Meade justified it by his conduct of the\r\noperations, and in the famous three days' battle he inflicted a complete\r\ndefeat on General Lee's army. His reward was the commission of\r\nbrigadier-general in the regular army. In the autumn of 1863 a war of\r\nmanoeuvre was fought between the two commanders, on the whole favourably\r\nto the Union arms. Grant, commanding all the armies of the United\r\nStates, joined the Army of the Potomac in the spring of 1864, and\r\nremained with it until the end of the war; but he continued Meade in his\r\ncommand, and successfully urged his appointment as major-general in the\r\nregular army (Aug. 18, 1864), eulogizing him as the commander who had\r\nsuccessfully met and defeated the best general and the strongest army on\r\nthe Confederate side. After the war Meade commanded successively the\r\nmilitary division of the Atlantic, the department of the east, the third\r\nmilitary district (Georgia and Alabama) and the department of the south.\r\nHe died at Philadelphia on the 6th of November, 1872. The degree of\r\nLL.D. was conferred upon him by Harvard University, and his scientific\r\nattainments were recognized by the American Philosophical Society and\r\nthe Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. There are statues of\r\nGeneral Meade in Philadelphia and at Gettysburg.\r\n\r\n  See I. R. Pennypacker, _General Meade_ (\"Great Commanders\" series, New\r\n  York, 1901).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADE, WILLIAM (1789-1862), American Protestant Episcopal bishop, the\r\nson of Richard Kidder Meade (1746-1805), one of General Washington's\r\naides during the War of Independence, was born on the 11th of November\r\n1789, near Millwood, in that part of Frederick county which is now\r\nClarke county, Virginia. He graduated as valedictorian in 1808 at the\r\ncollege of New Jersey (Princeton); studied theology under the Rev.\r\nWalter Addison of Maryland, and in Princeton; was ordained deacon in\r\n1811 and priest in 1814; and preached both in the Stone Chapel,\r\nMillwood, and in Christ Church, Alexandria, for some time. He became\r\nassistant bishop of Virginia in 1829; was pastor of Christ Church,\r\nNorfolk, in 1834-1836; in 1841 became bishop of Virginia; and in\r\n1842-1862 was president of the Protestant Episcopal Theological Seminary\r\nin Virginia, near Alexandria, delivering an annual course of lectures on\r\npastoral theology. In 1819 he had acted as the agent of the American\r\nColonization Society to purchase slaves, illegally brought into Georgia,\r\nwhich had become the property of that state and were sold publicly at\r\nMilledgeville. He had been prominent in the work of the Education\r\nSociety, which was organized in 1818 to advance funds to needy students\r\nfor the ministry of the American Episcopal Church, and in the\r\nestablishment of the Theological Seminary near Alexandria, as he was\r\nafterwards in the work of the American Tract Society, and the Bible\r\nSociety. He was a founder and president of the Evangelical Knowledge\r\nSociety (1847), which, opposing what it considered the heterodoxy of\r\nmany of the books published by the Sunday School Union, attempted to\r\ndisplace them by issuing works of a more evangelical type. A low\r\nChurchman, he strongly opposed Tractarianism. He was active in the case\r\nagainst Bishop Henry Ustick Onderdonk (1789-1858) of Pennsylvania, who\r\nbecause of intemperance was forced to resign and was suspended from the\r\nministry in 1844; in that against Bishop Benjamin Tredwell Onderdonk\r\n(1791-1861) of New York, who in 1845 was suspended from the ministry on\r\nthe charge of intoxication and improper conduct; and in that against\r\nBishop G. W. Doane of New Jersey. He fought against the threatening\r\nsecession of Virginia, but acquiesced in the decision of the state and\r\nbecame presiding bishop of the Southern Church. He died in Richmond,\r\nVirginia, on the 14th of March 1862.\r\n\r\n  Among his publications, besides many sermons, were _A Brief Review of\r\n  the Episcopal Church in Virginia_ (1845); _Wilberforce, Cranmer,\r\n  Jewett and the Prayer Book on the Incarnation_ (1850); _Reasons for\r\n  Loving the Episcopal Church_ (1852); and _Old Churches, Ministers and\r\n  Families of Virginia_ (1857); a storehouse of material on the\r\n  ecclesiastical history of the state.\r\n\r\n  See the _Life_ by John Johns (Baltimore, 1867).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADVILLE, a city and the county-seat of Crawford county, Pennsylvania,\r\nU.S.A., on French Creek, 36 m. S. of Erie. Pop. (1900), 10,291, of whom\r\n912 were foreign-born and 173 were negroes; (1910 census) 12,780. It is\r\nserved by the Erie, and the Bessemer & Lake Erie railways. Meadville has\r\nthree public parks, two general hospitals and a public library, and is\r\nthe seat of the Pennsylvania College of Music, of a commercial college,\r\nof the Meadville Theological School (1844, Unitarian), and of Allegheny\r\nCollege (co-educational), which was opened in 1815, came under the\r\ngeneral patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1833, and in 1909\r\nhad 322 students (200 men and 122 women). Meadville is the commercial\r\ncentre of a good agricultural region, which also abounds in oil and\r\nnatural gas. The Erie Railroad has extensive shops here, which in 1905\r\nemployed 46.7% of the total number of wage-earners, and there are\r\nvarious manufactures. The factory product in 1905 was valued at\r\n$2,074,600, being 24.4% more than that of 1900. Meadville, the oldest\r\nsettlement in N.W. Pennsylvania, was founded as a fortified post by\r\nDavid Mead in 1793, laid out as a town in 1795, incorporated as a\r\nborough in 1823 and chartered as a city in 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAGHER, THOMAS FRANCIS (1823-1867), Irish nationalist and American\r\nsoldier, was born in Waterford, Ireland, on the 3rd of August 1823. He\r\ngraduated at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, in 1843, and in 1844 began\r\nthe study of law at Dublin. He became a member of the Young Ireland\r\nParty in 1845, and in 1847 was one of the founders of the Irish\r\nConfederation. In March 1848 he made a speech before the Confederation\r\nwhich led to his arrest for sedition, but at his trial the jury failed\r\nto agree and he was discharged. In the following July the Confederation\r\ncreated a \"war directory\" of five, of which Meagher was a member, and he\r\nand William Smith O'Brien travelled through Ireland for the purpose of\r\nstarting a revolution. The attempt proved abortive; Meagher was arrested\r\nin August, and in October was tried for high treason before a special\r\ncommission at Clonmel. He was found guilty and was condemned to death,\r\nbut his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in Van Diemen's Land,\r\nwhither he was transported in the summer of 1849. Early in 1852 he\r\nescaped, and in May reached New York City. He made a tour of the cities\r\nof the United States as a popular lecturer, and then studied law and was\r\nadmitted to the New York bar in 1855. He made two unsuccessful ventures\r\nin journalism, and in 1857 went to Central America, where he acquired\r\nmaterial for another series of lectures. In 1861 he was captain of a\r\ncompany (which he had raised) in the 69th regiment of New York\r\nvolunteers and fought at the first battle of Bull Run; he then organized\r\nan Irish brigade, of whose first regiment he was colonel until the 3rd\r\nof February 1862, when he was appointed to the command of this\r\norganization with the rank of brigadier-general. He took part in the\r\nsiege of Yorktown, the battle of Fair Oaks, the seven days' battle\r\nbefore Richmond, and the battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, where he\r\nwas wounded, and Chancellorsville, where his brigade was reduced in\r\nnumbers to less than a regiment, and General Meagher resigned his\r\ncommission. On the 23rd of December 1863 his resignation was cancelled,\r\nand he was assigned to the command of the military district of Etowah,\r\nwith headquarters at Chattanooga. At the close of the war he was\r\nappointed by President Johnson secretary of Montana Territory, and\r\nthere, in the absence of the territorial governor, he acted as governor\r\nfrom September 1866 until his death from accidental drowning in the\r\nMissouri River near Fort Benton, Montana, on the 1st of July 1867. He\r\npublished _Speeches on the Legislative Independence of Ireland_ (1852).\r\n\r\n  W. F. Lyons, in _Brigadier-General Thomas Francis Meagher_ (New York,\r\n  1870), gives a eulogistic account of his career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAL. (1) (A word common to Teutonic languages, cf. Ger. _Mehl_, Du.\r\nmeel; the ultimate source is the root seen in various Teutonic words\r\nmeaning \"to grind,\" and in Eng. \"mill,\" Lat. _mola_, _molere_, Gr.\r\n[Greek: mylê]), a powder made from the edible part of any grain or\r\npulse, with the exception of wheat, which is known as \"flour.\" In\r\nAmerica the word is specifically applied to the meal produced from\r\nIndian corn or maize, as in Scotland and Ireland to that produced from\r\noats, while in South Africa the ears of the Indian corn itself are\r\ncalled \"mealies.\" (2) Properly, eating and drinking at regular stated\r\ntimes of the day, as breakfast, dinner, &c., hence taking of food at any\r\ntime and also the food provided. The word was in O.E. _mael_, which also\r\nhad the meanings (now lost) of time, mark, measure, &c., which still\r\nappear in many forms of the word in Teutonic languages; thus Ger. _mal_,\r\ntime, mark, cf. _Denkmal_, monument, _Mahl_, meal, repast, or Du.\r\n_maal_, Swed. _mal_, also with both meanings. The ultimate source is the\r\npre-Teutonic root _me-_ _ma-_, to measure, and the word thus stood for a\r\nmarked-out point of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEALIE, the South African name for Indian corn or maize. The word as\r\nspelled represents the pronunciation of the Cape Dutch _milje_, an\r\nadaptation of _milho_ (_da India_), the millet of India, the Portuguese\r\nname for millet, used in South Africa for maize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAN, an homonymous word, the chief uses of which may be divided thus.\r\n(1) A verb with two principal applications, to intend, purpose or\r\ndesign, and to signify. This word is in O.E. _maenan_, and cognate forms\r\nappear in other Teutonic languages, cf. Du. _meenen_, Ger. _meinen_. The\r\nultimate origin is usually taken to be the root _men-_, to think, the\r\nroot of \"mind.\" (2) An adjective and substantive meaning \"that which is\r\nin the middle.\" This is derived through the O. Fr. _men_, _meien_ or\r\n_moien_, modern _moyen_, from the late Lat. adjective _medianus_, from\r\n_medius_, middle. The law French form _mesne_ is still preserved in\r\ncertain legal phrases (see MESNE). The adjective \"mean\" is chiefly used\r\nin the sense of \"average,\" as in mean temperature, mean birth or death\r\nrate, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Mean\" as a substantive has the following principal applications; it is\r\nused of that quality, course of action, condition, state, &c., which is\r\nequally distant from two extremes, as in such phrases as the \"golden (or\r\nhappy) mean.\" For the philosophic application see ARISTOTLE and ETHICS.\r\n\r\nIn mathematics, the term \"mean,\" in its most general sense, is given to\r\nsome function of two or more quantities which (1) becomes equal to each\r\nof the quantities when they themselves are made equal, and (2) is\r\nunaffected in value when the quantities suffer any transpositions. The\r\nthree commonest means are the arithmetical, geometrical, and harmonic;\r\nof less importance are the contraharmonical, arithmetico-geometrical,\r\nand quadratic.\r\n\r\nFrom the sense of that which stands between two things, \"mean,\" or the\r\nplural \"means,\" often with a singular construction, takes the further\r\nsignificance of agency, instrument, &c., of which that produces some\r\nresult, hence resources capable of producing a result, particularly the\r\npecuniary or other resources by which a person is enabled to live, and\r\nso used either of employment or of property, wealth, &c. There are many\r\nadverbial phrases, such as \"by all means,\" \"by no means,\" &c., which are\r\nextensions of \"means\" in the sense of agency.\r\n\r\nThe word \"mean\" (like the French _moyen_) had also the sense of\r\nmiddling, moderate, and this considerably influenced the uses of \"mean\"\r\n(3). This, which is now chiefly used in the sense of inferior, low,\r\nignoble, or of avaricious, penurious, \"stingy,\" meant originally that\r\nwhich is common to more persons or things than one. The word in O. E. is\r\n_gemaéne_, and is represented in the modern Ger. _gemein_, common. It is\r\ncognate with Lat. _communis_, from which \"common\" is derived. The\r\ndescent in meaning from that which is shared alike by several to that\r\nwhich is inferior, vulgar or low, is paralleled by the uses of \"common.\"\r\n\r\nIn astronomy the \"mean sun\" is a fictitious sun which moves uniformly in\r\nthe celestial equator and has its right ascension always equal to the\r\nsun's mean longitude. The time recorded by the mean sun is termed\r\nmean-solar or clock time; it is regular as distinct from the non-uniform\r\nsolar or sun-dial time. The \"mean moon\" is a fictitious moon which moves\r\naround the earth with a uniform velocity and in the same time as the\r\nreal moon. The \"mean longitude\" of a planet is the longitude of the\r\n\"mean\" planet, i.e. a fictitious planet performing uniform revolutions\r\nin the same time as the real planet.\r\n\r\n  The arithmetical mean of n quantities is the sum of the quantities\r\n  divided by their number n. The geometrical mean of n quantities is the\r\n  nth root of their product. The harmonic mean of n quantities is the\r\n  arithmetical mean of their reciprocals. The significance of the word\r\n  \"mean,\" i.e., middle, is seen by considering 3 instead of n\r\n  quantities; these will be denoted by a, b, c. The arithmetic mean b,\r\n  is seen to be such that the terms a, b, c are in arithmetical\r\n  progression, i.e. b = ½(a + c); the geometrical mean b places a, b, c\r\n  in geometrical progression, i.e. in the proportion a : b :: b : c or\r\n  b² = ac; and the harmonic mean places the quantities in harmonic\r\n  proportion, i.e. a : c :: a - b : b - c, or b = 2ac/(a + c). The\r\n  contraharmonical mean is the quantity b given by the proportion a : c\r\n  :: b - c : a - b, i.e. b = (a² + c²)/(a + c). The\r\n  arithmetico-geometrical mean of two quantities is obtained by first\r\n  forming the geometrical and arithmetical means, then forming the means\r\n  of these means, and repeating the process until the numbers become\r\n  equal. They were invented by Gauss to facilitate the computation of\r\n  elliptic integrals. The quadratic mean of n quantities is the square\r\n  root of the arithmetical mean of their squares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASLES, (_Morbilli_, _Rubeola_; the M. E. word is _maseles_, properly a\r\ndiminutive of a word meaning \"spot,\" O.H.G. _masa_, cf. \"mazer\"; the\r\nequivalent is Ger. _Masern_; Fr. _Rougeole_), an acute infectious\r\ndisease occurring mostly in children. It is mentioned in the writings of\r\nRhazes and others of the Arabian physicians in the 10th century. For\r\nlong, however, it was held to be a variety of small-pox. After the\r\nnon-identity of these two diseases had been established, measles and\r\nscarlet-fever continued to be confounded with each other; and in the\r\naccount given by Thomas Sydenham of epidemics of measles in London in\r\n1670 and 1674 it is evident that even that accurate observer had not as\r\nyet clearly perceived their pathological distinction, although it would\r\nseem to have been made a century earlier by Giovanni Filippo Ingrassias\r\n(1510-1580), a physician of Palermo. The specific micro-organism\r\nresponsible for measles has not been definitely isolated.\r\n\r\nIts progress is marked by several stages more or less sharply defined.\r\nAfter the reception of the contagion into the system, there follows a\r\nperiod of incubation or latency during which scarcely any disturbance of\r\nthe health is perceptible. This period generally lasts for from ten to\r\nfourteen days, when it is followed by the invasion of the symptoms\r\nspecially characteristic of measles. These consist in the somewhat\r\nsudden onset of acute catarrh of the mucous membranes. At this stage\r\nminute white spots in the buccal mucous membrane frequently occur; when\r\nthey do, they are diagnostic of the disease. Sneezing, accompanied with\r\na watery discharge, sometimes bleeding, from the nose, redness and\r\nwatering of the eyes, cough of a short, frequent, and noisy character,\r\nwith little or no expectoration, hoarseness of the voice, and\r\noccasionally sickness and diarrhoea, are the chief local phenomena of\r\nthis stage. With these there is well-marked febrile disturbance, the\r\ntemperature being elevated (102°-104° F.), and the pulse rapid, while\r\nheadache, thirst, and restlessness are usually present. In some\r\ninstances, these initial symptoms are slight, and the child is allowed\r\nto associate with others at a time when, as will be afterwards seen,\r\nthe contagion of the disease is most active. In rare cases, especially\r\nin young children, convulsions usher in, or occur in the course of, this\r\nstage of invasion, which lasts as a rule for four or five days, the\r\nfebrile symptoms, however, showing some tendency to undergo abatement\r\nafter the second day. On the fourth or fifth day after the invasion,\r\nsometimes later, rarely earlier, the characteristic eruption appears on\r\nthe skin, being first noticed on the brow, cheeks, chin, also behind the\r\nears, and on the neck. It consists of small spots of a dusky red or\r\ncrimson colour, just like flea-bites, slightly elevated above the\r\nsurface, at first isolated, but tending to become grouped into patches\r\nof irregular, occasionally crescentic, outline, with portions of skin\r\nfree from the eruption intervening. The face acquires a swollen and\r\nbloated appearance, which, taken with the catarrh of the nostrils and\r\neyes, is almost characteristic, and renders the diagnosis at this stage\r\na matter of no difficulty. The eruption spreads downwards over the body\r\nand limbs, which are soon thickly studded with the red spots or patches.\r\nSometimes these become confluent over a considerable surface. The rash\r\ncontinues to come out for two or three days, and then begins to fade in\r\nthe order in which it first showed itself, namely from above downwards.\r\nBy the end of about a week after its first appearance scarcely any trace\r\nof the eruption remains beyond a faint staining of the skin. Usually\r\nduring convalescence slight peeling of the epidermis takes place, but\r\nmuch less distinctly than is the case in scarlet fever. At the\r\ncommencement of the eruptive stage the fever, catarrh, and other\r\nconstitutional disturbance, which were present from the beginning,\r\nbecome aggravated, the temperature often rising to 105° or more, and\r\nthere is headache, thirst, furred tongue, and soreness of the throat,\r\nupon which red patches similar to those on the surface of the body may\r\nbe observed. These symptoms usually decline as soon as the rash has\r\nattained its maximum, and often there occurs a sudden and extensive fall\r\nof temperature, indicating that the crisis of the disease has been\r\nreached. In favourable cases convalescence proceeds rapidly, the patient\r\nfeeling perfectly well even before the rash has faded from the skin.\r\n\r\nMeasles may, however, occur in a very malignant form, in which the\r\nsymptoms throughout are of urgent character, the rash but feebly\r\ndeveloped, and of dark purple hue, while there is great prostration,\r\naccompanied with intense catarrh of the respiratory or gastro-intestinal\r\nmucous membrane. Such cases are rare, occurring mostly in circumstances\r\nof bad hygiene, both as regards the individual and his surroundings. On\r\nthe other hand, cases of measles are often of so mild a form throughout\r\nthat the patient can scarcely be persuaded to submit to treatment.\r\n\r\nMeasles as a disease derives its chief importance from the risk, by no\r\nmeans slight, of certain complications which are apt to arise during its\r\ncourse, more especially inflammatory affections of the respiratory\r\norgans. These are most liable to occur in the colder seasons of the year\r\nand in very young and delicate children. It has been already stated that\r\nirritation of the respiratory passages is one of the symptoms\r\ncharacteristic of measles, but that this subsides with the decline of\r\nthe eruption. Not unfrequently, however, these symptoms, instead of\r\nabating, become aggravated, and bronchitis of the capillary form (see\r\nBRONCHITIS), or pneumonia, generally of the diffuse or lobular variety\r\n(see PNEUMONIA), supervene. By far the greater proportion of the\r\nmortality in measles is due to its complications, of which those just\r\nmentioned are the most common, but which also include inflammatory\r\naffections of the larynx, with attacks resembling croup, and also\r\ndiarrhoea assuming a dysenteric character. Or there may remain as direct\r\nresults of the disease chronic ophthalmia, or discharge from the ears\r\nwith deafness, and occasionally a form of gangrene affecting the tissues\r\nof the mouth or cheeks and other parts of the body, leading to\r\ndisfigurement and gravely endangering life.\r\n\r\nApart from those immediate risks there appears to be a tendency in many\r\ncases for the disease to leave behind a weakened and vulnerable\r\ncondition of the general health, which may render children, previously\r\nrobust, delicate and liable to chest complaints, and is in not a few\r\ninstances the precursor of some of those tubercular affections to which\r\nthe period of childhood and youth is liable. These various effects or\r\nsequelae of measles indicate that although in itself a comparatively\r\nmild ailment, it should not be regarded with indifference. Indeed it is\r\ndoubtful whether any other disease of early life demands more careful\r\nwatching as to its influence on the health. Happily many of those\r\nattending evils may by proper management be averted.\r\n\r\nMeasles is a disease of the earlier years of childhood. Like other\r\ninfectious maladies, it is admittedly rare, though not unknown, in\r\nnurslings or infants under six months old. It is comparatively seldom\r\nmet with in adults, but this is due to the fact that most persons have\r\nundergone an attack in early life. Where this has not been the case, the\r\nold suffer equally with the young. All races of men appear liable to\r\nthis disease, provided that which constitutes the essential factor in\r\nits origin and spread exists, namely, contagion. Some countries enjoy\r\nlong immunity from outbreaks of measles, but it has frequently been\r\nfound in such cases that when the contagion has once been introduced the\r\ndisease extends with great rapidity and virulence. This was shown by the\r\nepidemic in the Faroe Islands in 1846, where, within six months after\r\nthe arrival of a single case of measles, more than three-fourths of the\r\nentire population were attacked and many perished; and the similarly\r\nproduced and still more destructive outbreak in Fiji in 1875, in which\r\nit was estimated that about one-fourth of the inhabitants died from the\r\ndisease in about three months. In both these cases the great mortality\r\nwas due to the complications of the malady, specially induced by\r\novercrowding, insanitary surroundings, the absence of proper nourishment\r\nand nursing for the sick, and the utter prostration and terror of the\r\npeople, and to the disease being specially malignant, occurring on what\r\nmight be termed virgin soil.[1] It may be regarded as an invariable rule\r\nthat the first epidemic of any disease in a community is specially\r\nvirulent, each successive attack conferring a certain immunity.\r\n\r\nIn many lands, such as the United Kingdom, measles is rarely absent,\r\nespecially from large centres of population, where sporadic cases are\r\nfound at all seasons. Every now and then epidemics arise from the\r\nextension of the disease among those members of a community who have not\r\nbeen in some measure protected by a previous attack. There are few\r\ndiseases so contagious as measles, and its rapid spread in epidemic\r\noutbreaks is no doubt due to the well-ascertained fact that contagion is\r\nmost potent in the earlier stages, even before its real nature has been\r\nevinced by the characteristic appearances on the skin. Hence the\r\ndifficulty of timely isolation, and the readiness with which the disease\r\nis spread in schools and families. The contagion is present in the skin\r\nand the various secretions. While the contagion is generally direct, it\r\ncan also be conveyed by the particles from the nose and mouth which,\r\nafter being expelled, become dry and are conveyed as dust on clothes,\r\ntoys, &c. Fortunately the germs of measles do not retain their virulence\r\nlong under such conditions, comparing favourably with those of some\r\nother diseases.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment embraces the preventive measures to be\r\nadopted by the isolation of the sick at as early a period as possible.\r\nEpidemics have often, especially in limited localities, been curtailed\r\nby such a precaution. In families with little house accommodation this\r\nmeasure is frequently, for the reason given regarding the communicable\r\nperiod of the disease, ineffectual; nevertheless where practicable it\r\nought to be tried. The unaffected children should be kept from school\r\nfor a time (probably about three weeks from the outbreak in the family\r\nwould suffice if no other case occur in the interval), and all clothing\r\nin contact with the patient or nurses should be disinfected. In\r\nextensive epidemics it is often desirable to close the schools for a\r\ntime. As regards special treatment, in an ordinary case of measles\r\nlittle is required beyond what is necessary in febrile conditions\r\ngenerally. Confinement to bed in a somewhat darkened room, into which,\r\nhowever, air is freely admitted; light, nourishing, liquid diet (soups,\r\nmilk, &c.), water almost _ad lib._ to drink, and mild diaphoretic\r\nremedies such as the acetate of ammonia or ipecacuanha, are all that is\r\nnecessary in the febrile stage. When the fever is very severe, sponging\r\nthe body generally or the chest and arms affords relief. The serious\r\nchest complications of measles are to be dealt with by those measures\r\napplicable for the relief of the particular symptoms (see BRONCHITIS;\r\nPNEUMONIA). The preparations of ammonia are of special efficacy. During\r\nconvalescence the patient must be guarded from exposure to cold, and for\r\na time after recovery the state of the health ought to be watched with a\r\nview of averting the evils, both local and constitutional, which too\r\noften follow this disease.\r\n\r\n  \"German measles\" (_Rötheln_, or _Epidemic Roseola_) is a term applied\r\n  to a contagious eruptive disorder having certain points of resemblance\r\n  to measles, and also to scarlet fever, but exhibiting its distinct\r\n  individuality in the fact that it protects from neither of these\r\n  diseases. It occurs most commonly in children, but frequently in\r\n  adults also, and is occasionally seen in extensive epidemics. Beyond\r\n  confinement to the house in the eruptive stage, which, from the slight\r\n  symptoms experienced, is often difficult of accomplishment, no special\r\n  treatment is called for. There is little doubt that the disease is\r\n  often mistaken for true measles, and many of the alleged second\r\n  attacks of the latter malady are probably cases of rötheln. The chief\r\n  points of difference are the following: (1) The absence of distinct\r\n  premonitory symptoms, the stage of invasion, which in measles is\r\n  usually of four days' duration, and accompanied with well-marked fever\r\n  and catarrh, being in rötheln either wholly absent or exceedingly\r\n  slight, enduring only for one day. (2) The eruption of rötheln, which,\r\n  although as regards its locality and manner of progress similar to\r\n  measles, differs somewhat in its appearance, the spots being of\r\n  smaller size, paler colour, and with less tendency to grouping in\r\n  crescentic patches. The rash attains its maximum in about one day, and\r\n  quickly disappears. There is not the same increase of temperature in\r\n  this stage as in measles. (3) The presence of white spots on the\r\n  buccal mucous membrane, in the case of measles. (4) The milder\r\n  character of the symptoms of rötheln throughout its whole course, and\r\n  the absence of complications and of liability to subsequent impairment\r\n  of health such as have been seen to appertain to measles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] _Transactions of the Epidemiological Society_ (London, 1877).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT, a word originally applied to food in general, and so still used in\r\nsuch phrases as \"meat and drink\"; but now, except as an archaism,\r\ngenerally used of the flesh of certain domestic animals, slaughtered for\r\nhuman food by butchers, \"butcher's meat,\" as opposed to \"game,\" that of\r\nwild animals, \"fish\" or \"poultry.\" Cognate forms of the O. Eng. _mete_\r\nare found in certain Teutonic languages, e.g. Swed. _mat_, Dan. _mad_\r\nand O. H. Ger. _Maz_. The ultimate origin has been disputed; the _New\r\nEnglish Dictionary_ considers probable a connexion with the root _med-_,\r\n\"to be fat,\" seen in Sansk. _meda_, Lat. _madere_, \"to be wet,\" and Eng.\r\n\"mast,\" the fruit of the beech as food for pigs.\r\n\r\n  See DIETETICS; FOOD PRESERVATION; PUBLIC HEALTH; AGRICULTURE; and the\r\n  sections dealing with agricultural statistics under the names of the\r\n  various countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEATH (pronounced with _th_ soft, as in _the_), a county of Ireland in\r\nthe province of Leinster, bounded E. by the Irish Sea, S.E. by Dublin,\r\nS. by Kildare and King's County, W. by Westmeath, N.W. by Cavan and\r\nMonaghan, and N.E. by Louth. Area 579,320 acres, or about 905 sq. m. In\r\nsome districts the surface is varied by hills and swells, which to the\r\nwest reach a considerable elevation, although the general features of a\r\nfine champain country are never lost. The coast, low and shelving,\r\nextends about 10 m., but there is no harbour of importance. Laytown is a\r\nsmall seaside resort, 5 m. S.E. of Drogheda. The Boyne enters the county\r\nat its south-western extremity, and flowing north-east to Drogheda\r\ndivides it into two almost equal parts. At Navan it receives the\r\nBlackwater, which flows south-west from Cavan. Both these rivers are\r\nnoted for their trout, and salmon are taken in the Boyne. The Boyne is\r\nnavigable for barges as far as Navan whence a canal is carried to Trim.\r\nThe Royal Canal passes along the southern boundary of the county from\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\n  In the north is a broken country of Silurian rocks with much igneous\r\n  material, partly contemporaneous, partly intrusive, near Slane.\r\n  Carboniferous Limestone stretches from the Boyne valley to the Dublin\r\n  border, giving rise to a flat plain especially suitable for grazing.\r\n  Outliers of higher Carboniferous strata occur on the surface; but the\r\n  Coal Measures have all been removed by denudation.\r\n\r\n  The climate is genial and favourable for all kinds of crops, there\r\n  being less rain than even in the neighbouring counties. Except a small\r\n  portion occupied by the Bog of Allen, the county is verdant and\r\n  fertile. The soil is principally a rich deep loam resting on limestone\r\n  gravel, but varies from a strong clayey loam to a light sandy gravel.\r\n  The proportion of tillage to pasturage is roughly as 1 to 3½. Oats,\r\n  potatoes and turnips are the principal crops, but all decrease. The\r\n  numbers of cattle, sheep and poultry, however, are increasing or well\r\n  maintained. Agriculture is almost the sole industry, but coarse linen\r\n  is woven by hand-looms, and there are a few woollen manufactories. The\r\n  main line of the Midland Great Western railway skirts the southern\r\n  boundary, with a branch line north from Clonsilla to Navan and\r\n  Kingscourt (county Cavan). From Kilmessan on this line a branch serves\r\n  Trim and Athboy. From Drogheda (county Louth) a branch of the Great\r\n  Northern railway crosses the county from east to West by Navan and\r\n  Kells to Oldcastle.\r\n\r\n  The population (76,111 in 1891; 67,497 in 1901) suffers a large\r\n  decrease, considerably above the average of Irish counties, and\r\n  emigration is heavy. Nearly 93% are Roman Catholics. The chief towns\r\n  are Navan (pop. 3839), Kells (2428) and Trim (1513), the county town.\r\n  Lesser market towns are Oldcastle and Athboy, an ancient town which\r\n  received a charter from Henry IV. The county includes eighteen\r\n  baronies. Assizes are held at Trim, and quarter sessions at Kells,\r\n  Navan and Trim. The county is in the Protestant dioceses of Armagh,\r\n  Kilmore and Meath, and in the Roman Catholic dioceses of Armagh and\r\n  Meath. Before the Union in 1800 it sent fourteen members to\r\n  parliament, but now only two members are returned, for the north and\r\n  south divisions of the county respectively.\r\n\r\n_History and Antiquities._--A district known as Meath (Midhe), and\r\nincluding the present county of Meath as well as Westmeath and Longford,\r\nwith parts of Cavan, Kildare and King's County, was formed by Tuathal\r\n(c. 130) into a kingdom to serve as mensal land or personal estate of\r\nthe Ard Ri or over-king of Ireland. Kings of Meath reigned until 1173,\r\nand the title was claimed as late as the 15th century by their\r\ndescendants, but at the date mentioned Hugh de Lacy obtained the\r\nlordship of the country and was confirmed in it by Henry II. Meath thus\r\ncame into the English \"Pale.\" But though it was declared a county in the\r\nreign of Edward I. (1296), and though it came by descent into the\r\npossession of the Crown in the person of Edward IV., it was long before\r\nit was fully subdued and its boundaries clearly defined. In 1543\r\nWestmeath was created a county apart from that of Meath, but as late as\r\n1598 Meath was still regarded as a province by some, who included in it\r\nthe counties Westmeath, East Meath, Longford and Cavan. In the early\r\npart of the 17th century it was at last established as a county, and no\r\nlonger considered as a fifth province of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThere are two ancient round towers, the one at Kells and the other in\r\nthe churchyard of Donaghmore, near Navan. By the river Boyne near Slane\r\nthere is an extensive ancient burial-place called Brugh. Here are some\r\ntwenty burial mounds, the largest of which is that of New Grange, a\r\ndomed tumulus erected above a circular chamber, which is entered by a\r\nnarrow passage enclosed by great upright blocks of stone, covered with\r\ncarvings. The mound is surrounded by remains of a stone circle, and the\r\nwhole forms one of the most remarkable extant erections of its kind.\r\nTara (q.v.) is famous in history, especially as the seat of a royal\r\npalace referred to in the well-known lines of Thomas Moore. Monastic\r\nbuildings were very numerous in Meath, among the more important ruins\r\nbeing those of Duleek, which is said to have been the first\r\necclesiastical building in Ireland of stone and mortar; the extensive\r\nremains of Bective Abbey; and those of Clonard, where also were a\r\ncathedral and a famous college. Of the old fortresses, the castle of\r\nTrim still presents an imposing appearance. There are many fine old\r\nmansions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAUX, a town of northern France, capital of an arrondissement in the\r\ndepartment of Seine-et-Marne, and chief town of the agricultural region\r\nof Brie, 28 m. E.N.E. of Paris by rail. Pop. (1906), 11,089. The town\r\nproper stands on an eminence on the right bank of the Marne; on the left\r\nbank lies the old suburb of Le Marché, with which it is united by a\r\nbridge of the 16th century. Two rows of picturesque mills of the same\r\nperiod are built across the river. The cathedral of St Stephen dates\r\nfrom the 12th to the 16th centuries, and was restored in the 19th\r\ncentury. Of the two western towers, the completed one is that to the\r\nnorth of the façade, the other being disfigured by an unsightly slate\r\nroof. The building, which is 275 ft. long and 105 ft. high, consists of\r\na short nave, with aisles, a fine transept, a choir and a sanctuary. The\r\nchoir contains the statue and the tomb of Bossuet, bishop from 1681 to\r\n1704, and the pulpit of the cathedral has been reconstructed with the\r\npanels of that from which the \"eagle of Meaux\" used to preach. The\r\ntransept terminates at each end in a fine portal surmounted by a\r\nrose-window. The episcopal palace (17th century) has several curious old\r\nrooms; the buildings of the choir school are likewise of some\r\narchaeological interest. A statue of General Raoult (1870) stands in one\r\nof the squares.\r\n\r\nMeaux is the centre of a considerable trade in cereals, wool, Brie\r\ncheeses, and other farm-produce, while its mills provide much of the\r\nflour with which Paris is supplied. Other industries are saw-milling,\r\nmetal-founding, distilling, the preparation of vermicelli and preserved\r\nvegetables, and the manufacture of mustard, hosiery, plaster and\r\nmachinery. There are nursery-gardens in the vicinity. The Canal de\r\nl'Ourcq, which surrounds the town, and the Marne furnish the means of\r\ntransport. Meaux is the seat of a bishopric dating from the 4th century,\r\nand has among its public institutions a sub-prefecture, and tribunals of\r\nfirst instance and of commerce.\r\n\r\nIn the Roman period Meaux was the capital of the Meldi, a small Gallic\r\ntribe, and in the middle ages of the Brie. It formed part of the kingdom\r\nof Austrasia, and afterwards belonged to the counts of Vermandois and\r\nChampagne, the latter of whom established important markets on the left\r\nbank of the Marne. Its communal charter, received from them, is dated\r\n1179. A treaty signed at Meaux in 1229 after the Albigensian War sealed\r\nthe submission of Raymond VII., count of Toulouse. The town suffered\r\nmuch during the Jacquerie, the peasants receiving a severe check there\r\nin 1358; during the Hundred Years' War; and also during the Religious\r\nWars, in which it was an important Protestant centre. It was the first\r\ntown which opened its gates to Henry IV. in 1594. On the high-road for\r\ninvaders marching on Paris from the east of France, Meaux saw its\r\nenvirons ravaged by the army of Lorraine in 1652, and was laid under\r\nheavy requisitions in 1814, 1815 and 1870. In September 1567 Meaux was\r\nthe scene of an attempt made by the Protestants to seize the French king\r\nCharles IX., and his mother Catherine de' Medici. The plot, which is\r\nsometimes called the \"enterprise of Meaux,\" failed, the king and queen\r\nwith their courtiers escaping to Paris. This conduct, however, on the\r\npart of the Huguenots had doubtless some share in influencing Charles to\r\nassent to the massacre of St Bartholomew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMECCA (Arab. _Makkah_),[1] the chief town of the Hejaz in Arabia, and\r\nthe great holy city of Islam. It is situated two camel marches (the\r\nresting-place being Bahra or Hadda), or about 45 m. almost due E., from\r\nJidda on the Red Sea. Thus on a rough estimate Mecca lies in 21° 25´ N.,\r\n39° 50´ E. It is said in the Koran (_Sur._ xiv. 40) that Mecca lies in a\r\nsterile valley, and the old geographers observe that the whole Haram or\r\nsacred territory round the city is almost without cultivation or date\r\npalms, while fruit trees, springs, wells, gardens and green valleys are\r\nfound immediately beyond. Mecca in fact lies in the heart of a mass of\r\nrough hills, intersected by a labyrinth of narrow valleys and passes,\r\nand projecting into the Tehama or low country on the Red Sea, in front\r\nof the great mountain wall that divides the coast-lands from the central\r\nplateau, though in turn they are themselves separated from the sea by a\r\nsecond curtain of hills forming the western wall of the great Wadi Marr.\r\nThe inner mountain wall is pierced by only two great passes, and the\r\nvalleys descending from these embrace on both sides the Mecca hills.\r\n\r\nHolding this position commanding two great routes between the lowlands\r\nand inner Arabia, and situated in a narrow and barren valley incapable\r\nof supporting an urban population, Mecca must have been from the first a\r\ncommercial centre.[2] In the palmy days of South Arabia it was probably\r\na station on the great incense route, and thus Ptolemy may have learned\r\nthe name, which he writes Makoraba. At all events, long before Mahomet\r\nwe find Mecca established in the twofold quality of a commercial centre\r\nand a privileged holy place, surrounded by an inviolable territory (the\r\nHaram), which was not the sanctuary of a single tribe but a place of\r\npilgrimage, where religious observances were associated with a series of\r\nannual fairs at different points in the vicinity. Indeed in the\r\nunsettled state of the country commerce was possible only under the\r\nsanctions of religion, and through the provisions of the sacred truce\r\nwhich prohibited war for four months of the year, three of these being\r\nthe month of pilgrimage, with those immediately preceding and following.\r\nThe first of the series of fairs in which the Meccans had an interest\r\nwas at Okaz on the easier road between Mecca and Taif, where there was\r\nalso a sanctuary, and from it the visitors moved on to points still\r\nnearer Mecca (Majanna, and finally Dhul-Majaz, on the flank of Jebel\r\nKabkab behind Arafa) where further fairs were held,[3] culminating in\r\nthe special religious ceremonies of the great feast at 'Arafa, Quzah\r\n(Mozdalifa), and Mecca itself. The system of intercalation in the lunar\r\ncalendar of the heathen Arabs was designed to secure that the feast\r\nshould always fall at the time when the hides, fruits and other\r\nmerchandise were ready for market,[4] and the Meccans, who knew how to\r\nattract the Bedouins by hospitality, bought up these wares in exchange\r\nfor imported goods, and so became the leaders of the international trade\r\nof Arabia. Their caravans traversed the length and breadth of the\r\npeninsula. Syria, and especially Gaza, was their chief goal. The Syrian\r\ncaravan intercepted, on its return, at Badr (see MAHOMET) represented\r\ncapital to the value of £20,000, an enormous sum for those days.[5]\r\n\r\nThe victory of Mahommedanism made a vast change in the position of\r\nMecca. The merchant aristocracy became satraps or pensioners of a great\r\nempire; but the seat of dominion was removed beyond the desert, and\r\nthough Mecca and the Hejaz strove for a time to maintain political as\r\nwell as religious predominance, the struggle was vain, and terminated on\r\nthe death of Ibn Zubair, the Meccan pretendant to the caliphate, when\r\nthe city was taken by Hajjaj (A.D. 692). The sanctuary and feast of\r\nMecca received, however, a new prestige from the victory of Islam.\r\nPurged of elements obviously heathen, the Ka'ba became the holiest site,\r\nand the pilgrimage the most sacred ritual observance of Mahommedanism,\r\ndrawing worshippers from so wide a circle that the confluence of the\r\npetty traders of the desert was no longer the main feature of the holy\r\nseason. The pilgrimage retained its importance for the commercial\r\nwell-being of Mecca; to this day the Meccans live by the Hajj--letting\r\nrooms, acting as guides and directors in the sacred ceremonies, as\r\ncontractors and touts for land and sea transport, as well as exploiting\r\nthe many benefactions that flow to the holy city; while the surrounding\r\nBedouins derive support from the camel-transport it demands and from the\r\nsubsidies by which they are engaged to protect or abstain from molesting\r\nthe pilgrim caravans. But the ancient \"fairs of heathenism\" were given\r\nup, and the traffic of the pilgrim season, sanctioned by the Prophet in\r\n_Sur._ ii. 194, was concentrated at Mina and Mecca, where most of the\r\npilgrims still have something to buy or sell, so that Mina, after the\r\nsacrifice of the feast day, presents the aspect of a huge international\r\nfancy fair.[6] In the middle ages this trade was much more important\r\nthan it is now. Ibn Jubair (ed. Wright, p. 118 seq.) in the 12th century\r\ndescribes the mart of Mecca in the eight days following the feast as\r\nfull of gems, unguents, precious drugs, and all rare merchandise from\r\nIndia, Irak, Khorasan, and every part of the Moslem world.\r\n\r\nThe hills east and west of Mecca, which are partly built over and rise\r\nseveral hundred feet above the valley, so enclose the city that the\r\nancient walls only barred the valley at three points, where three gates\r\nled into the town. In the time of Ibn Jubair the gates still stood\r\nthough the walls were ruined, but now the gates have only left their\r\nnames to quarters of the town. At the northern or upper end was the Bab\r\nel Ma'la, or gate of the upper quarter, whence the road continues up the\r\nvalley towards Mina and Arafa as well as towards Zeima and the Nejd.\r\nBeyond the gate, in a place called the Hajun, is the chief cemetery,\r\ncommonly called el Ma'la, and said to be the resting-place of many of\r\nthe companions of Mahomet. Here a cross-road, running over the hill to\r\njoin the main Medina road from the western gate, turns off to the west\r\nby the pass of Kada, the point from which the troops of the Prophet\r\nstormed the city (A.H. 8).[7] Here too the body of Ibn Zubair was hung\r\non a cross by Hajjaj. The lower or southern gate, at the Masfala\r\nquarter, opened on the Yemen road, where the rain-water from Mecca flows\r\noff into an open valley. Beyond, there are mountains on both sides; on\r\nthat to the east, commanding the town, is the great castle, a fortress\r\nof considerable strength. The third or western gate, Bab el-Omra\r\n(formerly also Bab el-Zahir, from a village of that name), lay almost\r\nopposite the great mosque, and opened on a road leading westwards round\r\nthe southern spurs of the Red Mountain. This is the way to Wadi Fatima\r\nand Medina, the Jidda road branching off from it to the left.\r\nConsiderable suburbs now lie outside the quarter named after this gate;\r\nin the middle ages a pleasant country road led for some miles through\r\npartly cultivated land with good wells, as far as the boundary of the\r\nsacred territory and gathering place of the pilgrims at Tanim, near the\r\nmosque of Ayesha. This is the spot on the Medina road now called the\r\nOmra, from a ceremonial connected with it which will be mentioned below.\r\n\r\nThe length of the sinuous main axis of the city from the farthest\r\nsuburbs on the Medina road to the suburbs in the extreme north, now\r\nfrequented by Bedouins, is, according to Burckhardt, 3500 paces.[8]\r\nAbout the middle of this line the longitudinal thoroughfares are pushed\r\naside by the vast courtyard and colonnades composing the great mosque,\r\nwhich, with its spacious arcades surrounding the Ka'ba and other holy\r\nplaces, and its seven minarets, forms the only prominent architectural\r\nfeature of the city. The mosque is enclosed by houses with windows\r\nopening on the arcades and commanding a view of the Ka'ba. Immediately\r\nbeyond these, on the side facing Jebel Abu Kobais, a broad street runs\r\nsouth-east and north-west across the valley. This is the Mas'a (sacred\r\ncourse) between the eminences of Safa and Merwa, and has been from very\r\nearly times one of the most lively bazaars and the centre of Meccan\r\nlife. The other chief bazaars are also near the mosque in smaller\r\nstreets. The general aspect of the town is picturesque; the streets are\r\nfairly spacious, though ill-kept and filthy; the houses are all of\r\nstone, many of them well-built and four or five storeys high, with\r\nterraced roofs and large projecting windows as in Jidda--a style of\r\nbuilding which has not varied materially since the 10th century\r\n(Mukaddasi, p. 71), and gains in effect from the way in which the\r\ndwellings run up the sides and spurs of the mountains. Of public\r\ninstitutions there are baths, ribats, or hospices, for poor pilgrims\r\nfrom India, Java, &c., a hospital and a public kitchen for the poor.\r\n\r\nThe mosque is at the same time the university hall, where between two\r\npilgrim seasons lectures are delivered on Mahommedan law, doctrine and\r\nconnected branches of science. A poorly provided public library is open\r\nto the use of students. The madrassehs or buildings around the mosque,\r\noriginally intended as lodgings for students and professors, have long\r\nbeen let out to rich pilgrims. The minor places of visitation for\r\npilgrims, such as the birthplaces of the prophet and his chief\r\nfollowers, are not notable.[9] Both these and the court of the great\r\nmosque lie beneath the general level of the city, the site having been\r\ngradually raised by accumulated rubbish. The town in fact has little air\r\nof antiquity; genuine Arab buildings do not last long, especially in a\r\nvalley periodically ravaged by tremendous floods when the tropical rains\r\nburst on the surrounding hills. The history of Mecca is full of the\r\nrecord of these inundations, unsuccessfully combated by the great dam\r\ndrawn across the valley by the caliph Omar (_Kutbeddin_, p. 76), and\r\nlater works of Mahdi.[10]\r\n\r\nThe fixed population of Mecca in 1878 was estimated by Assistant-Surgeon\r\n'Abd el-Razzaq at 50,000 to 60,000; there is a large floating\r\npopulation--and that not merely at the proper season of pilgrimage, the\r\npilgrims of one season often beginning to arrive before those of the\r\nformer season have all dispersed. At the height of the season the town\r\nis much overcrowded, and the entire want of a drainage system is\r\nseverely felt. Fortunately good water is tolerably plentiful; for,\r\nthough the wells are mostly undrinkable, and even the famous Zamzam\r\nwater only available for medicinal or religious purposes, the\r\nunderground conduit from beyond Arafa, completed by Sultan Selim II. in\r\n1571, supplies to the public fountains a sweet and light water,\r\ncontaining, according to 'Abd el-Razzaq, a large amount of chlorides.\r\nThe water is said to be free to townsmen, but is sold to the pilgrims at\r\na rather high rate.[11]\r\n\r\nMedieval writers celebrate the copious supplies, especially of fine\r\nfruits, brought to the city from Taif and other fertile parts of Arabia.\r\nThese fruits are still famous; rice and other foreign products are\r\nbrought by sea to Jidda; mutton, milk and butter are plentifully\r\nsupplied from the desert.[12] The industries all centre in the\r\npilgrimage; the chief object of every Meccan--from the notables and\r\nsheikhs, who use their influence to gain custom for the Jidda\r\nspeculators in the pilgrim traffic, down to the cicerones, pilgrim\r\nbrokers, lodging-house keepers, and mendicants at the holy places--being\r\nto pillage the visitor in every possible way. The fanaticism of the\r\nMeccan is an affair of the purse; the mongrel population (for the town\r\nis by no means purely Arab) has exchanged the virtues of the Bedouin for\r\nthe worst corruptions of Eastern town life, without casting off the\r\nferocity of the desert, and it is hardly possible to find a worse\r\ncertificate of character than the three parallel gashes on each cheek,\r\ncalled Tashrit, which are the customary mark of birth in the holy city.\r\nThe unspeakable vices of Mecca are a scandal to all Islam, and a\r\nconstant source of wonder to pious pilgrims.[13] The slave trade has\r\nconnexions with the pilgrimage which are not thoroughly clear; but under\r\ncover of the pilgrimage a great deal of importation and exportation of\r\nslaves goes on.\r\n\r\nSince the fall of Ibn Zubair the political position of Mecca has always\r\nbeen dependent on the movements of the greater Mahommedan world. In the\r\nsplendid times of the caliphs immense sums were lavished upon the\r\npilgrimage and the holy city; and conversely the decay of the central\r\nauthority of Islam brought with it a long period of faction, wars and\r\nmisery, in which the most notable episode was the sack of Mecca by the\r\nCarmathians at the pilgrimage season of A.D. 930. The victors carried\r\noff the \"black stone,\" which was not restored for twenty-two years, and\r\nthen only for a great ransom, when it was plain that even the loss of\r\nits palladium could not destroy the sacred character of the city. Under\r\nthe Fatimites Egyptian influence began to be strong in Mecca; it was\r\nopposed by the sultans of Yemen, while native princes claiming descent\r\nfrom the Prophet--the Hashimite amirs of Mecca, and after them the amirs\r\nof the house of Qatada (since 1202)--attained to great authority and\r\naimed at independence; but soon after the final fall of the Abbasids the\r\nEgyptian overlordship was definitely established by sultan Bibars (A.D.\r\n1269). The Turkish conquest of Egypt transferred the supremacy to the\r\nOttoman sultans (1517), who treated Mecca with much favour, and during\r\nthe 16th century executed great works in the sanctuary and temple. The\r\nOttoman power, however, became gradually almost nominal, and that of the\r\namirs or sherifs increased in proportion, culminating under Ghalib,\r\nwhose accession dates from 1786. Then followed the wars of the Wahhabis\r\n(see ARABIA and WAHHABIS) and the restoration of Turkish rule by the\r\ntroops of Mehemet 'Ali. By him the dignity of sherif was deprived of\r\nmuch of its weight, and in 1827 a change of dynasty was effected by the\r\nappointment of Ibn 'Aun. Afterwards Turkish authority again decayed.\r\nMecca is, however, officially the capital of a Turkish province, and has\r\na governor-general and a Turkish garrison, while Mahommedan law is\r\nadministered by a judge sent from Constantinople. But the real sovereign\r\nof Mecca and the Hejaz is the sherif, who, as head of a princely family\r\nclaiming descent from the Prophet, holds a sort of feudal position. The\r\ndignity of sherif (or grand sherif, as Europeans usually say for the\r\nsake of distinction, since all the kin of the princely houses reckoning\r\ndescent from the Prophet are also named sherifs), although by no means a\r\nreligious pontificate, is highly respected owing to its traditional\r\ndescent in the line of Hasan, son of the fourth caliph 'Ali. From a\r\npolitical point of view the sherif is the modern counterpart of the\r\nancient amirs of Mecca, who were named in the public prayers immediately\r\nafter the reigning caliph. When the great Mahommedan sultanates had\r\nbecome too much occupied in internecine wars to maintain order in the\r\ndistant Hejaz, those branches of the Hassanids which from the beginning\r\nof Islam had retained rural property in Arabia usurped power in the holy\r\ncities and the adjacent Bedouin territories. About A.D. 960 they\r\nestablished a sort of kingdom with Mecca as capital. The influence of\r\nthe princes of Mecca has varied from time to time, according to the\r\nstrength of the foreign protectorate in the Hejaz or in consequence of\r\nfeuds among the branches of the house; until about 1882 it was for most\r\npurposes much greater than that of the Turks. The latter were strong\r\nenough to hold the garrisoned towns, and thus the sultan was able within\r\ncertain limits--playing off one against the other the two rival branches\r\nof the aristocracy, viz. the kin of Ghalib and the house of Ibn'Aun--to\r\nassert the right of designating or removing the sherif, to whom in turn\r\nhe owed the possibility of maintaining, with the aid of considerable\r\npensions, the semblance of his much-prized lordship over the holy\r\ncities. The grand sherif can muster a considerable force of freedmen and\r\nclients, and his kin, holding wells and lands in various places through\r\nthe Hejaz, act as his deputies and administer the old Arabic customary\r\nlaw to the Bedouin. To this influence the Hejaz owes what little of law\r\nand order it enjoys. During the last quarter of the 19th century Turkish\r\ninfluence became preponderant in western Arabia, and the railway from\r\nSyria to the Hejaz tended to consolidate the sultan's supremacy. After\r\nthe sherifs, the principal family of Mecca is the house of Shaibah,\r\nwhich holds the hereditary custodianship of the Ka'ba.\r\n\r\n_The Great Mosque and the Ka'ba._--Long before Mahomet the chief\r\nsanctuary of Mecca was the Ka'ba, a rude stone building without windows,\r\nand having a door 7 ft. from the ground; and so named from its\r\nresemblance to a monstrous _astragalus_ (die) of about 40 ft. cube,\r\nthough the shapeless structure is not really an exact cube nor even\r\nexactly rectangular.[14] The Ka'ba has been rebuilt more than once since\r\nMahomet purged it of idols and adopted it as the chief sanctuary of\r\nIslam, but the old form has been preserved, except in secondary\r\ndetails;[15] so that the \"Ancient House,\" as it is titled, is still\r\nessentially a heathen temple, adapted to the worship of Islam by the\r\nclumsy fiction that it was built by Abraham and Ishmael by divine\r\nrevelation as a temple of pure monotheism, and that it was only\r\ntemporarily perverted to idol worship from the time when 'Amr ibn Lohai\r\nintroduced the statue of Hobal from Syria[16] till the victory of Islam.\r\nThis fiction has involved the superinduction of a new mythology over the\r\nold heathen ritual, which remains practically unchanged. Thus the chief\r\nobject of veneration is the black stone, which is fixed in the external\r\nangle facing Safa. The building is not exactly oriented, but it may be\r\ncalled the south-east corner. Its technical name is the black corner,\r\nthe others being named the Yemen (south-west), Syrian (north-west), and\r\nIrak (north-east) corners, from the lands to which they approximately\r\npoint. The black stone is a small dark mass a span long, with an aspect\r\nsuggesting volcanic or meteoric origin, fixed at such a height that it\r\ncan be conveniently kissed by a person of middle size. It was broken by\r\nfire in the siege of A.D. 683 (not, as many authors relate, by the\r\nCarmathians), and the pieces are kept together by a silver setting. The\r\nhistory of this heavenly stone, given by Gabriel to Abraham, does not\r\nconceal the fact that it was originally a fetish, the most venerated of\r\na multitude of idols and sacred stones which stood all round the\r\nsanctuary in the time of Mahomet. The Prophet destroyed the idols, but\r\nhe left the characteristic form of worship--the _tawaf_, or sevenfold\r\ncircuit of the sanctuary, the worshipper kissing or touching the objects\r\nof his veneration--and besides the black stone he recognized the\r\nso-called \"southern\" stone, the same presumably as that which is still\r\ntouched in the tawaf at the Yemen corner (_Muh. in Med._ pp. 336, 425).\r\nThe ceremony of the tawaf and the worship of stone fetishes was common\r\nto Mecca with other ancient Arabian sanctuaries.[17] It was, as it still\r\nis, a frequent religious exercise of the Meccans, and the first duty of\r\none who returned to the city or arrived there under a vow of pilgrimage;\r\nand thus the outside of the Ka'ba was and is more important than the\r\ninside. Islam did away with the worship of idols; what was lost in\r\ninterest by their suppression has been supplied by the invention of\r\nspots consecrated by recollections of Abraham, Ishmael and Hagar, or\r\nheld to be acceptable places of prayer. Thus the space of ten spans\r\nbetween the black stone and the door, which is on the east side, between\r\nthe black and Irak corners, and a man's height from the ground, is\r\ncalled the _Multazam_, and here prayer should be offered after the tawaf\r\nwith outstretched arms and breast pressed against the house. On the\r\nother side of the door, against the same wall, is a shallow trough,\r\nwhich is said to mark the original site of the stone on which Abraham\r\nstood to build the Ka'ba. Here the growth of the legend can be traced,\r\nfor the place is now called the \"kneading-place\" (Ma'jan), where the\r\ncement for the Ka'ba was prepared. This name and story do not appear in\r\nthe older accounts. Once more, on the north side of the Ka'ba, there\r\nprojects a low semicircular wall of marble, with an opening at each end\r\nbetween it and the walls of the house. The space within is paved with\r\nmosaic, and is called the Hijr. It is included in the tawaf, and two\r\nslabs of _verde antico_ within it are called the graves of Ishmael and\r\nHagar, and are places of acceptable prayer. Even the golden or gilded\r\n_mizab_ (water-spout) that projects into the Hijr marks a place where\r\nprayer is heard, and another such place is the part of the west wall\r\nclose to the Yemen corner.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of religious conservatism which has preserved the structural\r\nrudeness of the Ka'ba did not prohibit costly surface decoration. In\r\nMahomet's time the outer walls were covered by a veil (or _kiswa_) of\r\nstriped Yemen cloth. The caliphs substituted a covering of figured\r\nbrocade, and the Egyptian government still sends with each pilgrim\r\ncaravan from Cairo a new kiswa of black brocade, adorned with a broad\r\nband embroidered with golden inscriptions from the Koran, as well as a\r\nricher curtain for the door.[18] The door of two leaves, with its posts\r\nand lintel, is of silver gilt.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the Ka'ba is now opened but a few times every year for\r\nthe general public, which ascends by the portable staircase brought\r\nforward for the purpose. Foreigners can obtain admission at any time for\r\na special fee. The modern descriptions, from observations made under\r\ndifficulties, are not very complete. Little change, however, seems to\r\nhave been made since the time of Ibn Jubair, who describes the floor and\r\nwalls as overlaid with richly variegated marbles, and the upper half of\r\nthe walls as plated with silver thickly gilt, while the roof was veiled\r\nwith coloured silk. Modern writers describe the place as windowless, but\r\nIbn Jubair mentions five windows of rich stained glass from Irak.\r\nBetween the three pillars of teak hung thirteen silver lamps. A chest in\r\nthe corner to the left of one entering contained Korans, and at the Irak\r\ncorner a space was cut off enclosing the stair that leads to the roof.\r\nThe door to this stair (called the door of mercy--Bab el-Rahma) was\r\nplated with silver by the caliph Motawakkil. Here, in the time of Ibn\r\nJubair, the _Maqam_ or standing stone of Abraham was usually placed for\r\nbetter security, but brought out on great occasions.[19]\r\n\r\nThe houses of ancient Mecca pressed close upon the Ka'ba, the noblest\r\nfamilies, who traced their descent from Kosai, the reputed founder of\r\nthe city, having their dwellings immediately round the sanctuary. To the\r\nnorth of the Ka'ba was the Dar el-Nadwa, or place of assembly of the\r\nKoreish. The multiplication of pilgrims after Islam soon made it\r\nnecessary to clear away the nearest dwellings and enlarge the place of\r\nprayer around the Ancient House. Omar, Othman and Ibn Jubair had all a\r\nshare in this work, but the great founder of the mosque in its present\r\nform, with its spacious area and deep colonnades, was the caliph Mahdi,\r\nwho spent enormous sums in bringing costly pillars from Egypt and Syria.\r\nThe work was still incomplete at his death in A.D. 785, and was finished\r\nin less sumptuous style by his successor. Subsequent repairs and\r\nadditions, extending down to Turkish times, have left little of Mahdi's\r\nwork untouched, though a few of the pillars probably date from his days.\r\nThere are more than five hundred pillars in all, of very various style\r\nand workmanship, and the enclosure--250 paces in length and 200 in\r\nbreadth, according to Burckhardt's measurement--is entered by nineteen\r\narchways irregularly disposed.\r\n\r\nAfter the Ka'ba the principal points of interest in the mosque are the\r\nwell Zamzam and the Maqam Ibrahim. The former is a deep shaft enclosed\r\nin a massive vaulted building paved with marble, and, according to\r\nMahommedan tradition, is the source (corresponding to the Beer-lahai-roi\r\nof Gen. xvi. 14) from which Hagar drew water for her son Ishmael. The\r\nlegend tells that the well was long covered up and rediscovered by 'Abd\r\nal-Mot[t.]alib, the grandfather of the Prophet. Sacred wells are\r\nfamiliar features of Semitic sanctuaries, and Islam, retaining the well,\r\nmade a quasi-biblical story for it, and endowed its tepid waters with\r\nmiraculous curative virtues. They are eagerly drunk by the pilgrims, or\r\nwhen poured over the body are held to give a miraculous refreshment\r\nafter the fatigues of religious exercise; and the manufacture of bottles\r\nor jars for carrying the water to distant countries is quite a trade.\r\nIbn Jubair mentions a curious superstition of the Meccans, who believed\r\nthat the water rose in the shaft at the full moon of the month Shaban.\r\nOn this occasion a great crowd, especially of young people, thronged\r\nround the well with shouts of religious enthusiasm, while the servants\r\nof the well dashed buckets of water over their heads. The Maqam of\r\nAbraham is also connected with a relic of heathenism, the ancient holy\r\nstone which once stood on the Ma'jan, and is said to bear the prints of\r\nthe patriarch's feet. The whole legend of this stone, which is full of\r\nmiraculous incidents, seems to have arisen from a misconception, the\r\nMaqam Ibrahim in the Koran meaning the sanctuary itself; but the stone,\r\nwhich is a block about 3 spans in height and 2 in breadth, and in shape\r\n\"like a potter's furnace\" (Ibn Jubair), is certainly very ancient. No\r\none is now allowed to see it, though the box in which it lies can be\r\nseen or touched through a grating in the little chapel that surrounds\r\nit. In the middle ages it was sometimes shown, and Ibn Jubair describes\r\nthe pious enthusiasm with which he drank Zamzam water poured on the\r\nfootprints. It was covered with inscriptions in an unknown character,\r\none of which was copied by Fakihi in his history of Mecca. To judge by\r\nthe facsimile in Dozy's _Israeliten te Mekka_, the character is probably\r\nessentially one with that of the Syrian Safa inscriptions, which\r\nextended through the Nejd and into the Hejaz.[20]\r\n\r\n  _Safa and Merwa._--In religious importance these two points or\r\n  \"hills,\" connected by the Mas'a, stand second only to the Ka'ba. Safa\r\n  is an elevated platform surmounted by a triple arch, and approached by\r\n  a flight of steps.[21] It lies south-east of the Ka'ba, facing the\r\n  black corner, and 76 paces from the \"Gate of Safa,\" which is\r\n  architecturally the chief gate of the mosque. Merwa is a similar\r\n  platform, formerly covered with a single arch, on the opposite side of\r\n  the valley. It stands on a spur of the Red Mountain called Jebel\r\n  Kuaykian. The course between these two sacred points is 493 paces\r\n  long, and the religious ceremony called the \"sa'y\" consists in\r\n  traversing it seven times, beginning and ending at Safa. The lowest\r\n  part of the course, between the so-called green milestones, is done at\r\n  a run. This ceremony, which, as we shall presently see, is part of the\r\n  omra, is generally said to be performed in memory of Hagar, who ran to\r\n  and fro between the two eminences vainly seeking water for her son.\r\n  The observance, however, is certainly of pagan origin; and at one time\r\n  there were idols on both the so-called hills (see especially Azraqi,\r\n  pp. 74, 78).\r\n\r\n  _The Ceremonies and the Pilgrimage._--Before Islam the Ka'ba was the\r\n  local sanctuary of the Meccans, where they prayed and did sacrifice,\r\n  where oaths were administered and hard cases submitted to divine\r\n  sentence according to the immemorial custom of Semitic shrines. But,\r\n  besides this, Mecca was already a place of pilgrimage. Pilgrimage with\r\n  the ancient Arabs was the fulfilment of a vow, which appears to have\r\n  generally terminated--at least on the part of the well-to-do--in a\r\n  sacrificial feast. A vow of pilgrimage might be directed to other\r\n  sanctuaries than Mecca--the technical word for it (_ihlal_) is\r\n  applied, for example, to the pilgrimage to Manat (_Bakri_, p. 519). He\r\n  who was under such a vow was bound by ceremonial observances of\r\n  abstinence from certain acts (e.g. hunting) and sensual pleasures, and\r\n  in particular was forbidden to shear or comb his hair till the\r\n  fulfilment of the vow. This old Semitic usage has its close parallel\r\n  in the vow of the Nazarite. It was not peculiarly connected with\r\n  Mecca; at Taif, for example, it was customary on return to the city\r\n  after an absence to present oneself at the sanctuary, and there shear\r\n  the hair (_Muh. in Med._, p. 381). Pilgrimages to Mecca were not tied\r\n  to a single time, but they were naturally associated with festive\r\n  occasions, and especially with the great annual feast and market. The\r\n  pilgrimage was so intimately connected with the well-being of Mecca,\r\n  and had already such a hold on the Arabs round about, that Mahomet\r\n  could not afford to sacrifice it to an abstract purity of religion,\r\n  and thus the old usages were transplanted into Islam in the double\r\n  form of the omra or vow of pilgrimage to Mecca, which can be\r\n  discharged at any time, and the hajj or pilgrimage at the great annual\r\n  feast. The latter closes with a visit to the Ka'ba, but its essential\r\n  ceremonies lie outside Mecca, at the neighbouring shrines where the\r\n  old Arabs gathered before the Meccan fair.\r\n\r\n  The omra begins at some point outside the Haram (or holy territory),\r\n  generally at Tanim, both for convenience sake and because Ayesha began\r\n  the omra there in the year 10 of the Hegira. The pilgrim enters the\r\n  Haram in the antique and scanty pilgrimage dress (ihram), consisting\r\n  of two cloths wound round his person in a way prescribed by ritual.\r\n  His devotion is expressed in shouts of \"Labbeyka\" (a word of obscure\r\n  origin and meaning); he enters the great mosque, performs the tawaf\r\n  and the sa'y[22] and then has his head shaved and resumes his common\r\n  dress. This ceremony is now generally combined with the hajj, or is\r\n  performed by every stranger or traveller when he enters Mecca, and the\r\n  ihram (which involves the acts of abstinence already referred to) is\r\n  assumed at a considerable distance from the city. But it is also\r\n  proper during one's residence in the holy city to perform at least one\r\n  omra from Tanim in connexion with a visit to the mosque of Ayesha\r\n  there. The triviality of these rites is ill concealed by the legends\r\n  of the sa'y of Hagar and of the tawaf being first performed by Adam in\r\n  imitation of the circuit of the angels about the throne of God; the\r\n  meaning of their ceremonies seems to have been almost a blank to the\r\n  Arabs before Islam, whose religion had become a mere formal tradition.\r\n  We do not even know to what deity the worship expressed in the tawaf\r\n  was properly addressed. There is a tradition that the Ka'ba was a\r\n  temple of Saturn (Shahrastani, p. 431); perhaps the most distinctive\r\n  feature of the shrine may be sought in the sacred doves which still\r\n  enjoy the protection of the sanctuary. These recall the sacred doves\r\n  of Ascalon (Philo vi. 200 of Richter's ed.), and suggests\r\n  Venus-worship as at least one element (cf. Herod i. 131, iii. 8; Ephr.\r\n  Syr., _Op. Syr._ ii. 457).\r\n\r\n  To the ordinary pilgrim the omra has become so much an episode of the\r\n  hajj that it is described by some European pilgrims as a mere visit to\r\n  the mosque of Ayesha; a better conception of its original significance\r\n  is got from the Meccan feast of the seventh month (Rajab), graphically\r\n  described by Ibn Jubair from his observations in A.D. 1184. Rajab was\r\n  one of the ancient sacred months, and the feast, which extended\r\n  through the whole month and was a joyful season of hospitality and\r\n  thanksgiving, no doubt represents the ancient feasts of Mecca more\r\n  exactly than the ceremonies of the hajj, in which old usage has been\r\n  overlaid by traditions and glosses of Islam. The omra was performed by\r\n  crowds from day to day, especially at new and full moon.[23] The new\r\n  moon celebration was nocturnal; the road to Tanim, the Mas'a, and the\r\n  mosque were brilliantly illuminated; and the appearing of the moon was\r\n  greeted with noisy music. A genuine old Arab market was held, for the\r\n  wild Bedouins of the Yemen mountains came in thousands to barter their\r\n  cattle and fruits for clothing, and deemed that to absent themselves\r\n  would bring drought and cattle plague in their homes. Though ignorant\r\n  of the legal ritual and prayers, they performed the tawaf with\r\n  enthusiasm, throwing themselves against the Ka'ba and clinging to its\r\n  curtains as a child clings to its mother. They also made a point of\r\n  entering the Ka'ba. The 29th of the month was the feast day of the\r\n  Meccan women, when they and their little ones had the Ka'ba to\r\n  themselves without the presence even of the Sheybas.\r\n\r\n  The central and essential ceremonies of the hajj or greater pilgrimage\r\n  are those of the day of Arafa, the 9th of the \"pilgrimage month\"\r\n  (Dhu'l Hijja), the last of the Arab year; and every Moslem who is his\r\n  own master, and can command the necessary means, is bound to join in\r\n  these once in his life, or to have them fulfilled by a substitute on\r\n  his behalf and at his expense. By them the pilgrim becomes as pure\r\n  from sin as when he was born, and gains for the rest of his life the\r\n  honourable title of hajj. Neglect of many other parts of the pilgrim\r\n  ceremonial may be compensated by offerings, but to miss the \"stand\"\r\n  (_woquf_) at Arafa is to miss the pilgrimage. Arafa or Arafat is a\r\n  space, artificially limited, round a small isolated hill called the\r\n  Hill of Mercy, a little way outside the holy territory, on the road\r\n  from Mecca to Taif. One leaving Mecca after midday can easily reach\r\n  the place on foot the same evening. The road is first northwards along\r\n  the Mecca valley and then turns eastward. It leads through the\r\n  straggling village of Mina, occupying a long narrow valley (Wadi\r\n  Mina), two to three hours from Mecca, and thence by the mosque of\r\n  Mozdalifa over a narrow pass opening out into the plain of Arafa,\r\n  which is an expansion of the great Wadi Naman, through which the Taif\r\n  road descends from Mount Kara. The lofty and rugged mountains of the\r\n  Hodheyl tower over the plain on the north side and overshadow the\r\n  little Hill of Mercy, which is one of those bosses of weathered\r\n  granite so common in the Hejaz. Arafa lay quite near Dhul-Majaz,\r\n  where, according to Arabian tradition, a great fair was held from the\r\n  1st to the 8th of the pilgrimage month; and the ceremonies from which\r\n  the hajj was derived were originally an appendix to this fair. Now, on\r\n  the contrary, the pilgrim is expected to follow as closely as may be\r\n  the movements of the prophet at his \"farewell pilgrimage\" in the year\r\n  10 of the Hegira (A.D. 632). He therefore leaves Mecca in pilgrim garb\r\n  on the 8th of Dhu'l Hijja, called the day of _tarwiya_ (an obscure and\r\n  pre-Islamic name), and, strictly speaking, should spend the night at\r\n  Mina. It is now, however, customary to go right on and encamp at once\r\n  at Arafa. The night should be spent in devotion, but the coffee booths\r\n  do a lively trade, and songs are as common as prayers. Next forenoon\r\n  the pilgrim is free to move about, and towards midday he may if he\r\n  please hear a sermon. In the afternoon the essential ceremony begins;\r\n  it consists simply in \"standing\" on Arafa shouting \"Labbeyka\" and\r\n  reciting prayers and texts till sunset. After the sun is down the vast\r\n  assemblage breaks up, and a rush (technically _ifada_, _daf'_, _nafr_)\r\n  is made in the utmost confusion to Mozdalifa, where the night prayer\r\n  is said and the night spent. Before sunrise next morning (the 10th) a\r\n  second \"stand\" like that on Arafa is made for a short time by\r\n  torchlight round the mosque of Mozdalifa, but before the sun is fairly\r\n  up all must be in motion in the second _ifada_ towards Mina. The day\r\n  thus begun is the \"day of sacrifice,\" and has four ceremonies--(1) to\r\n  pelt with seven stones a cairn (_jamrat al 'aqaba_) at the eastern end\r\n  of W. Mina, (2) to slay a victim at Mina and hold a sacrificial meal,\r\n  part of the flesh being also dried and so preserved, or given to the\r\n  poor,[24] (3) to be shaved and so terminate the _ihram_, (4) to make\r\n  the third _ifada_, i.e. go to Mecca and perform the tawaf and sa'y\r\n  (_'omrat al-ifada_), returning thereafter to Mina. The sacrifice and\r\n  visit to Mecca may, however, be delayed till the 11th, 12th or 13th.\r\n  These are the days of Mina, a fair and joyous feast, with no special\r\n  ceremony except that each day the pilgrim is expected to throw seven\r\n  stones at the _jamrat al 'aqaba_, and also at each of two similar\r\n  cairns in the valley. The stones are thrown in the name of Allah, and\r\n  are generally thought to be directed at the devil. This is, however, a\r\n  custom older than Islam, and a tradition in Azraqi, p. 412, represents\r\n  it as an act of worship to idols at Mina. As the stones are thrown on\r\n  the days of the fair, it is not unlikely that they have something to\r\n  do with the old Arab mode of closing a sale by the purchaser throwing\r\n  a stone (Biruni, p. 328).[25] The pilgrims leave Mina on the 12th or\r\n  13th, and the hajj is then over. (See further MAHOMMEDAN RELIGION.)\r\n\r\n  The colourless character of these ceremonies is plainly due to the\r\n  fact that they are nothing more than expurgated heathen rites. In\r\n  Islam proper they have no _raison d'être_; the legends about Adam and\r\n  Eve on Arafa, about Abraham's sacrifice of the ram at Thabii by Mina,\r\n  imitated in the sacrifices of the pilgrimage, are clumsy\r\n  afterthoughts, as appears from their variations and only partial\r\n  acceptance. It is not so easy to get at the nature of the original\r\n  rites, which Islam was careful to suppress. But we find mention of\r\n  practices condemned by the orthodox, or forming no part of the Moslem\r\n  ritual, which may be regarded as traces of an older ceremonial. Such\r\n  are nocturnal illuminations at Mina (Ibn Batuta i. 396), Arafa and\r\n  Mozdalifa (Ibn Jubair, 179), and tawafs performed by the ignorant at\r\n  holy spots at Arafa not recognized by law (Snouck-Hurgronje p. 149\r\n  sqq.). We know that the rites at Mozdalifa were originally connected\r\n  with a holy hill bearing the name of the god Quzah (the Edomite Koze)\r\n  whose bow is the rainbow, and there is reason to think that the\r\n  _ifadas_ from Arafa and Quzah, which were not made as now after sunset\r\n  and before sunrise, but when the sun rested on the tops of the\r\n  mountains, were ceremonies of farewell and salutation to the sun-god.\r\n\r\n  The statistics of the pilgrimage cannot be given with certainty and\r\n  vary much from year to year. The quarantine office keeps a record of\r\n  arrivals by sea at Jidda (66,000 for 1904); but to these must be added\r\n  those travelling by land from Cairo, Damascus and Irak, the pilgrims\r\n  who reach Medina from Yanbu and go on to Mecca, and those from all\r\n  parts of the peninsula. Burckhardt in 1814 estimated the crowd at\r\n  Arafa at 70,000, Burton in 1853 at 50,000, 'Abd el-Razzak in 1858 at\r\n  60,000. This great assemblage is always a dangerous centre of\r\n  infection, and the days of Mina especially, spent under circumstances\r\n  originally adapted only for a Bedouin fair, with no provisions for\r\n  proper cleanliness, and with the air full of the smell of putrefying\r\n  offal and flesh drying in the sun, produce much sickness.\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--Besides the Arabic geographers and cosmographers, we have\r\n  Ibn 'Abd Rabbih's description of the mosque, early in the 10th century\r\n  (_'Ikd Farid_, Cairo ed., iii. 362 sqq.), but above all the admirable\r\n  record of Ibn Jubair (A.D. 1184), by far the best account extant of\r\n  Mecca and the pilgrimage. It has been much pillaged by Ibn Batuta. The\r\n  Arabic historians are largely occupied with fabulous matter as to\r\n  Mecca before Islam; for these legends the reader may refer to C. de\r\n  Perceval's _Essai_. How little confidence can be placed in the\r\n  pre-Islamic history appears very clearly from the distorted accounts\r\n  of Abraha's excursion against the Hejaz, which fell but a few years\r\n  before the birth of the Prophet, and is the first event in Meccan\r\n  history which has confirmation from other sources. See Nöldeke's\r\n  version of Tabari, p. 204 sqq. For the period of the Prophet, Ibn\r\n  Hisham and Wakidi are valuable sources in topography as well as\r\n  history. Of the special histories and descriptions of Mecca published\r\n  by Wüstenfeld (_Chroniken der Stadt Mekka_, 3 vols., 1857-1859, with\r\n  an abstract in German, 1861), the most valuable is that of Azraqi. It\r\n  has passed through the hands of several editors, but the oldest part\r\n  goes back to the beginning of the 9th Christian century. Kutbeddin's\r\n  history (vol. iii. of the _Chroniken_) goes down with the additions of\r\n  his nephew to A.D. 1592.\r\n\r\n  Of European descriptions of Mecca from personal observation the best\r\n  is Burckhardt's _Travels in Arabia_ (cited above from the 8vo ed.,\r\n  1829). _The Travels of Aly Bey_ (Badia, London, 1816) describe a visit\r\n  in 1807; Burton's _Pilgrimage_ (3rd ed., 1879) often supplements\r\n  Burckhardt; Von Maltzan's _Wallfahrt nach Mekka_ (1865) is lively but\r\n  very slight. 'Abd el-Razzaq's report to the government of India on the\r\n  pilgrimage of 1858 is specially directed to sanitary questions; C.\r\n  Snouck-Hurgronje, _Mekka_ (2 vols., and a collection of photographs,\r\n  The Hague, 1888-1889), gives a description of the Meccan sanctuary and\r\n  of the public and private life of the Meccans as observed by the\r\n  author during a sojourn in the holy city in 1884-1885 and a political\r\n  history of Mecca from native sources from the Hegira till 1884. For\r\n  the pilgrimage see particularly Snouck-Hurgronje, _Het Mekkaansche\r\n  Feest_ (Leiden, 1880).     (W. R. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] A variant of the name Makkah is Bakkah (_Sur._ iii. 90; Bakri,\r\n    155 seq.). For other names and honorific epithets of the city see\r\n    Bakri, _ut supra_, Azraqi, p. 197, Yaqut iv. 617 seq. The lists are\r\n    in part corrupt, and some of the names (Kutha and 'Arsh or 'Ursh,\r\n    \"the huts\") are not properly names of the town as a whole.\r\n\r\n  [2] Mecca, says one of its citizens, in Waqidi (Kremer's ed., p. 196,\r\n    or _Muh. in Med._ p. 100), is a settlement formed for trade with\r\n    Syria in summer and Abyssinia in winter, and cannot continue to exist\r\n    if the trade is interrupted.\r\n\r\n  [3] The details are variously related. See Biruni, p. 328 (E. T., p.\r\n    324); Asma'i in Yaqut, iii. 705, iv. 416, 421; Azraqi, p. 129 seq.;\r\n    Bakri, p. 661. Jebel Kabkab is a great mountain occupying the angle\r\n    between W. Naman and the plain of Arafa. The peak is due north of\r\n    Sheddad, the hamlet which Burckhardt (i. 115) calls Shedad. According\r\n    to Azraqi, p. 80, the last shrine visited was that of the three trees\r\n    of Uzza in W. Nakhla.\r\n\r\n  [4] So we are told by Biruni, p. 62 (E. T., 73).\r\n\r\n  [5] Waqidi, ed.

Juynboll, p. 100. The minor sacred places are\r\n    described at length by Azraqi and Ibn Jubair. They are either\r\n    connected with genuine memories of the Prophet and his times, or have\r\n    spurious legends to conceal the fact that they were originally holy\r\n    stones, wells, or the like, of heathen sanctity.\r\n\r\n  [10] Baladhuri, in his chapter on the floods of Mecca (pp. 53 seq.),\r\n    says that 'Omar built two dams.\r\n\r\n  [11] The aqueduct is the successor of an older one associated with\r\n    the names of Zobaida, wife of Harun al-Rashid, and other benefactors.\r\n    But the old aqueduct was frequently out of repair, and seems to have\r\n    played but a secondary part in the medieval water supply. Even the\r\n    new aqueduct gave no adequate supply in Burckhardt's time.\r\n\r\n  [12] In Ibn Jubair's time large supplies were brought from the Yemen\r\n    mountains.\r\n\r\n  [13] The corruption of manners in Mecca is no new thing. See the\r\n    letter of the caliph Mahdi on the subject; Wüstenfeld, _Chron. Mek._,\r\n    iv. 168.\r\n\r\n  [14] The exact measurements (which, however, vary according to\r\n    different authorities) are stated to be: sides 37 ft. 2 in. and 38\r\n    ft. 4 in.; ends 31 ft. 7 in. and 29 ft.; height 35 ft.\r\n\r\n  [15] The Ka'ba of Mahomet's time was the successor of an older\r\n    building, said to have been destroyed by fire. It was constructed in\r\n    the still usual rude style of Arabic masonry, with string courses of\r\n    timber between the stones (like Solomon's Temple). The roof rested on\r\n    six pillars; the door was raised above the ground and approached by a\r\n    stair (probably on account of the floods which often swept the\r\n    valley); and worshippers left their shoes under the stair before\r\n    entering. During the first siege of Mecca (A.D. 683), the building\r\n    was burned down, the Ibn Zubair reconstructed it on an enlarged scale\r\n    and in better style of solid ashlar-work. After his death his most\r\n    glaring innovations (the introduction of two doors on a level with\r\n    the ground, and the extension of the building lengthwise to include\r\n    the Hijr) were corrected by Hajjaj, under orders from the caliph, but\r\n    the building retained its more solid structure. The roof now rested\r\n    on three pillars, and the height was raised one-half. The Ka'ba was\r\n    again entirely rebuilt after the flood of A.D. 1626, but since Hajjaj\r\n    there seem to have been no structural changes.\r\n\r\n  [16] Hobal was set up within the Temple over the pit that contained\r\n    the sacred treasures. His chief function was connected with the\r\n    sacred lot to which the Meccans were accustomed to betake themselves\r\n    in all matters of difficulty.\r\n\r\n  [17] See Ibn Hisham i. 54, Azraki p. 80 ('Uzza in Batn Marr); Yakut\r\n    iii. 705 (Otheyda); Bar Hebraeus on Psalm xii. 9. Stones worshipped\r\n    by circling round them bore the name _dawar_ or _duwar_ (Krehl, _Rel.\r\n    d. Araber_, p. 69). The later Arabs not unnaturally viewed such\r\n    cultus as imitated from that of Mecca (Yaqut iv. 622, cf. Dozy,\r\n    _Israeliten te Mekka_, p. 125, who draws very perverse inferences).\r\n\r\n  [18] The old _kiswa_ is removed on the 25th day of the month before\r\n    the pilgrimage, and fragments of it are bought by the pilgrims as\r\n    charms. Till the 10th day of the pilgrimage month the Ka'ba is bare.\r\n\r\n  [19] Before Islam the Ka'ba was opened every Monday and Thursday; in\r\n    the time of Ibn Jubair it was opened with considerable ceremony every\r\n    Monday and Friday, and daily in the month Rajab. But, though prayer\r\n    within the building is favoured by the example of the Prophet, it is\r\n    not compulsory on the Moslem, and even in the time of Ibn Batuta the\r\n    opportunities of entrance were reduced to Friday and the birthday of\r\n    the Prophet.\r\n\r\n  [20] See De Vogué, _Syrie centrale: inscr. sem._; Lady Anne Blunt\r\n    _Pilgrimage of Nejd_, ii., and W. R. Smith, in the _Athenaeum_, March\r\n    20, 1880.\r\n\r\n  [21] Ibn Jubair speaks of fourteen steps, Ali Bey of four, Burckhardt\r\n    of three. The surrounding ground no doubt has risen so that the old\r\n    name \"hill of Safa\" is now inapplicable.\r\n\r\n  [22] The latter perhaps was no part of the ancient omra; see\r\n    Snouck-Hurgronje, _Het Mekkaansche Feest_ (1880) p. 115 sqq.\r\n\r\n  [23] The 27th was also a great day, but this day was in commemoration\r\n    of the rebuilding of the Ka'ba by Ibn Jubair.\r\n\r\n  [24] The sacrifice is not indispensable except for those who can\r\n    afford it and are combining the hajj with the omra.\r\n\r\n  [25] On the similar pelting of the supposed graves of Abu Lahab and\r\n    his wife (Ibn Jubair, p. 110) and of Abu Righal at Mughammas, see\r\n    Nöldeke's translation of Tabari, 208.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICS. The subject of mechanics may be divided into two parts: (1)\r\ntheoretical or abstract mechanics, and (2) applied mechanics.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THEORETICAL MECHANICS\r\n\r\nHistorically theoretical mechanics began with the study of practical\r\ncontrivances such as the lever, and the name _mechanics_ (Gr. [Greek: ta\r\nmêchanika]), which might more properly be restricted to the theory of\r\nmechanisms, and which was indeed used in this narrower sense by Newton,\r\nhas clung to it, although the subject has long attained a far wider\r\nscope. In recent times it has been proposed to adopt the term _dynamics_\r\n(from Gr. [Greek: dynamis] force,) as including the whole science of the\r\naction of force on bodies, whether at rest or in motion. The subject is\r\nusually expounded under the two divisions of _statics_ and _kinetics_,\r\nthe former dealing with the conditions of rest or equilibrium and the\r\nlatter with the phenomena of motion as affected by force. To this latter\r\ndivision the old name of _dynamics_ (in a restricted sense) is still\r\noften applied. The mere geometrical description and analysis of various\r\ntypes of motion, apart from the consideration of the forces concerned,\r\nbelongs to _kinematics_. This is sometimes discussed as a separate\r\ntheory, but for our present purposes it is more convenient to introduce\r\nkinematical motions as they are required. We follow also the traditional\r\npractice of dealing first with statics and then with kinetics. This is,\r\nin the main, the historical order of development, and for purposes of\r\nexposition it has many advantages. The laws of equilibrium are, it is\r\ntrue, necessarily included as a particular case under those of motion;\r\nbut there is no real inconvenience in formulating as the basis of\r\nstatics a few provisional postulates which are afterwards seen to be\r\ncomprehended in a more general scheme.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject rests ultimately on the Newtonian laws of motion and\r\non some natural extensions of them. As these laws are discussed under a\r\nseparate heading (MOTION, LAWS OF), it is here only necessary to\r\nindicate the standpoint from which the present article is written. It is\r\na purely empirical one. Guided by experience, we are able to frame\r\nrules which enable us to say with more or less accuracy what will be the\r\nconsequences, or what were the antecedents, of a given state of things.\r\nThese rules are sometimes dignified by the name of \"laws of nature,\" but\r\nthey have relation to our present state of knowledge and to the degree\r\nof skill with which we have succeeded in giving more or less compact\r\nexpression to it. They are therefore liable to be modified from time to\r\ntime, or to be superseded by more convenient or more comprehensive modes\r\nof statement. Again, we do not aim at anything so hopeless, or indeed so\r\nuseless, as a _complete_ description of any phenomenon. Some features\r\nare naturally more important or more interesting to us than others; by\r\ntheir relative simplicity and evident constancy they have the first hold\r\non our attention, whilst those which are apparently accidental and vary\r\nfrom one occasion to another arc ignored, or postponed for later\r\nexamination. It follows that for the purposes of such description as is\r\npossible some process of abstraction is inevitable if our statements are\r\nto be simple and definite. Thus in studying the flight of a stone\r\nthrough the air we replace the body in imagination by a mathematical\r\npoint endowed with a mass-coefficient. The size and shape, the\r\ncomplicated spinning motion which it is seen to execute, the internal\r\nstrains and vibrations which doubtless take place, are all sacrificed in\r\nthe mental picture in order that attention may be concentrated on those\r\nfeatures of the phenomenon which are in the first place most interesting\r\nto us. At a later stage in our subject the conception of the ideal rigid\r\nbody is introduced; this enables us to fill in some details which were\r\npreviously wanting, but others are still omitted. Again, the conception\r\nof a force as concentrated in a mathematical line is as unreal as that\r\nof a mass concentrated in a point, but it is a convenient fiction for\r\nour purpose, owing to the simplicity which it lends to our statements.\r\n\r\nThe laws which are to be imposed on these ideal representations are in\r\nthe first instance largely at our choice. Any scheme of abstract\r\ndynamics constructed in this way, provided it be self-consistent, is\r\nmathematically legitimate; but from the physical point of view we\r\nrequire that it should help us to picture the sequence of phenomena as\r\nthey actually occur. Its success or failure in this respect can only be\r\njudged a posteriori by comparison of the results to which it leads with\r\nthe facts. It is to be noticed, moreover, that all available tests apply\r\nonly to the scheme as a whole; owing to the complexity of phenomena we\r\ncannot submit any one of its postulates to verification apart from the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIt is from this point of view that the question of relativity of motion,\r\nwhich is often felt to be a stumbling-block on the very threshold of the\r\nsubject, is to be judged. By \"motion\" we mean of necessity motion\r\nrelative to some frame of reference which is conventionally spoken of as\r\n\"fixed.\" In the earlier stages of our subject this may be any rigid, or\r\napparently rigid, structure fixed relatively to the earth. If we meet\r\nwith phenomena which do not fit easily into this view, we have the\r\nalternatives either to modify our assumed laws of motion, or to call to\r\nour aid adventitious forces, or to examine whether the discrepancy can\r\nbe reconciled by the simpler expedient of a new basis of reference. It\r\nis hardly necessary to say that the latter procedure has hitherto been\r\nfound to be adequate. As a first step we adopt a system of rectangular\r\naxes whose origin is fixed in the earth, but whose directions are fixed\r\nby relation to the stars; in the planetary theory the origin is\r\ntransferred to the sun, and afterwards to the mass-centre of the solar\r\nsystem; and so on. At each step there is a gain in accuracy and\r\ncomprehensiveness; and the conviction is cherished that _some_ system of\r\nrectangular axes exists with respect to which the Newtonian scheme holds\r\nwith all imaginable accuracy.\r\n\r\nA similar account might be given of the conception of time as a\r\nmeasurable quantity, but the remarks which it is necessary to make under\r\nthis head will find a place later.\r\n\r\n  The following synopsis shows the scheme on which the treatment is\r\n  based:--\r\n\r\n  _Part 1.--Statics._\r\n\r\n   1.

Theory of vibrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.--STATICS\r\n\r\n§ 1. _Statics of a Particle._--By a _particle_ is meant a body whose\r\nposition can for the purpose in hand be sufficiently specified by a\r\nmathematical point. It need not be \"infinitely small,\" or even small\r\ncompared with ordinary standards; thus in astronomy such vast bodies as\r\nthe sun, the earth, and the other planets can for many purposes be\r\ntreated merely as points endowed with mass.\r\n\r\nA _force_ is conceived as an effort having a certain direction and a\r\ncertain magnitude. It is therefore adequately represented, for\r\nmathematical purposes, by a straight line AB drawn in the direction in\r\nquestion, of length proportional (on any convenient scale) to the\r\nmagnitude of the force. In other words, a force is mathematically of the\r\nnature of a \"vector\" (see VECTOR ANALYSIS, QUATERNIONS). In most\r\nquestions of pure statics we are concerned only with the _ratios_ of the\r\nvarious forces which enter into the problem, so that it is indifferent\r\nwhat _unit_ of force is adopted. For many purposes a gravitational\r\nsystem of measurement is most natural; thus we speak of a force of so\r\nmany pounds or so many kilogrammes. The \"absolute\" system of measurement\r\nwill be referred to below in PART II., KINETICS. It is to be remembered\r\nthat all \"force\" is of the nature of a push or a pull, and that\r\naccording to the accepted terminology of modern mechanics such phrases\r\nas \"force of inertia,\" \"accelerating force,\" \"moving force,\" once\r\nclassical, are proscribed. This rigorous limitation of the meaning of\r\nthe word is of comparatively recent origin, and it is perhaps to be\r\nregretted that some more technical term has not been devised, but the\r\nconvention must now be regarded as established.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental postulate of this part of our subject is that the two\r\nforces acting on a particle may be compounded by the \"parallelogram\r\nrule.\" Thus, if the two forces P,Q be represented by the lines OA, OB,\r\nthey can be replaced by a single force R represented by the diagonal OC\r\nof the parallelogram determined by OA, OB. This is of course a physical\r\nassumption whose propriety is justified solely by experience. We shall\r\nsee later that it is implied in Newton's statement of his Second Law of\r\nmotion. In modern language, forces are compounded by \"vector-addition\";\r\nthus, if we draw in succession vectors [->HK], [->KL] to represent P, Q,\r\nthe force R is represented by the vector [->HL] which is the \"geometric\r\nsum\" of [->HK], [->KL].\r\n\r\nBy successive applications of the above rule any number of forces acting\r\non a particle may be replaced by a single force which is the vector-sum\r\nof the given forces: this single force is called the _resultant_. Thus\r\nif [->AB], [->BC], [->CD] ..., [->HK] be vectors representing the given\r\nforces, the resultant will be given by [->AK]. It will be understood\r\nthat the figure ABCD ... K need not be confined to one plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIf, in particular, the point K coincides with A, so that the resultant\r\nvanishes, the given system of forces is said to be in _equilibrium_--i.e.\r\nthe particle could remain permanently at rest under its action. This is\r\nthe proposition known as the _polygon of forces_. In the particular case\r\nof three forces it reduces to the _triangle of forces_, viz. \"If three\r\nforces acting on a particle are represented as to magnitude and direction\r\nby the sides of a triangle taken in order, they are in equilibrium.\"\r\n\r\nA sort of converse proposition is frequently useful, viz. if three\r\nforces acting on a particle be in equilibrium, and any triangle be\r\nconstructed whose sides are respectively parallel to the forces, the\r\nmagnitudes of the forces will be to one another as the corresponding\r\nsides of the triangle. This follows from the fact that all such\r\ntriangles are necessarily similar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n  As a simple example of the geometrical method of treating statical\r\n  problems we may consider the equilibrium of a particle on a \"rough\"\r\n  inclined plane. The usual empirical law of sliding friction is that\r\n  the mutual action between two plane surfaces in contact, or between a\r\n  particle and a curve or surface, cannot make with the normal an angle\r\n  exceeding a certain limit [lambda] called the _angle of friction_. If\r\n  the conditions of equilibrium require an obliquity greater than this,\r\n  sliding will take place. The precise value of [lambda] will vary with\r\n  the nature and condition of the surfaces in contact. In the case of a\r\n  body simply resting on an inclined plane, the reaction must of course\r\n  be vertical, for equilibrium, and the slope [alpha] of the plane must\r\n  therefore not exceed [lambda]. For this reason [lambda] is also known\r\n  as the _angle of repose_. If [alpha] > [lambda], a force P must be\r\n  applied in order to maintain equilibrium; let [theta] be the\r\n  inclination of P to the plane, as shown in the left-hand diagram. The\r\n  relations between this force P, the gravity W of the body, and the\r\n  reaction S of the plane are then determined by a triangle of forces\r\n  HKL. Since the inclination of S to the normal cannot exceed [lambda]\r\n  on either side, the value of P must lie between two limits which are\r\n  represented by L1H, L2H, in the right-hand diagram. Denoting these\r\n  limits by P1, P2, we have\r\n\r\n    P1/W = L1H/HK = sin ([alpha] - [lambda])/cos ([theta] + [lambda]),\r\n    P2/W = L2H/HK = sin ([alpha] + [lambda])/cos ([theta] - [lambda]).\r\n\r\n  It appears, moreover, that if [theta] be varied P will be least when\r\n  L1H is at right angles to KL1, in which case P1 = W sin ([alpha] -\r\n  [lambda]), corresponding to [theta] = -[lambda].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nJust as two or more forces can be combined into a single resultant, so a\r\nsingle force may be _resolved_ into _components_ acting in assigned\r\ndirections. Thus a force can be uniquely resolved into two components\r\nacting in two assigned directions in the same plane with it by an\r\ninversion of the parallelogram construction of fig. 1. If, as is usually\r\nmost convenient, the two assigned directions are at right angles, the\r\ntwo components of a force P will be P cos [theta], P sin [theta], where\r\n[theta] is the inclination of P to the direction of the former\r\ncomponent. This leads to formulae for the analytical reduction of a\r\nsystem of coplanar forces acting on a particle. Adopting rectangular\r\naxes Ox, Oy, in the plane of the forces, and distinguishing the various\r\nforces of the system by suffixes, we can replace the system by two\r\nforces X, Y, in the direction of co-ordinate axes; viz.--\r\n\r\n  X = P1 cos [theta]1 + P2 cos [theta]2 + ... = [Sigma](P cos [theta]),  }\r\n  Y = P1 sin [theta]1 + P2 sin [theta]2 + ... = [Sigma](P sin [theta]).  }  (1)\r\n\r\nThese two forces X, Y, may be combined into a single resultant R making\r\nan angle [phi] with Ox, provided\r\n\r\n  X = R cos [phi], Y = R sin [phi],  (2)\r\n\r\nwhence\r\n\r\n  R² = X² + Y², tan [phi] = Y/X.  (3)\r\n\r\nFor equilibrium we must have R = 0, which requires X = 0, Y = 0; in\r\nwords, the sum of the components of the system must be zero for each of\r\ntwo perpendicular directions in the plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nA similar procedure applies to a three-dimensional system. Thus if, O\r\nbeing the origin, [->OH] represent any force P of the system, the planes\r\ndrawn through H parallel to the co-ordinate planes will enclose with the\r\nlatter a parallelepiped, and it is evident that [->OH] is the geometric\r\nsum of [->OA], [->AN], [->NH], or [->OA], [->OB], [->OC], in the figure.\r\nHence P is equivalent to three forces Pl, Pm, Pn acting along Ox, Oy,\r\nOz, respectively, where l, m, n, are the \"direction-ratios\" of [->OH].\r\nThe whole system can be reduced in this way to three forces\r\n\r\n  X = [Sigma] (Pl), Y = [Sigma] (Pm), Z = [Sigma] (Pn),  (4)\r\n\r\nacting along the co-ordinate axes. These can again be combined into a\r\nsingle resultant R acting in the direction ([lambda], [mu], [nu]),\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n  X = R[lambda], Y = R[mu], Z = R[nu].  (5)\r\n\r\nIf the axes are rectangular, the direction-ratios become\r\ndirection-cosines, so that [lambda]² + [mu]² + [nu]² = 1, whence\r\n\r\n  R² = X² + Y² + Z².  (6)\r\n\r\nThe conditions of equilibrium are X = 0, Y = 0, Z = 0.\r\n\r\n§ 2. _Statics of a System of Particles._--We assume that the mutual\r\nforces between the pairs of particles, whatever their nature, are\r\nsubject to the \"Law of Action and Reaction\" (Newton's Third Law); i.e.\r\nthe force exerted by a particle A on a particle B, and the force exerted\r\nby B on A, are equal and opposite in the line AB. The problem of\r\ndetermining the possible configurations of equilibrium of a system of\r\nparticles subject to extraneous forces which are known functions of the\r\npositions of the particles, and to internal forces which are known\r\nfunctions of the distances of the pairs of particles between which they\r\nact, is in general determinate. For if n be the number of particles, the\r\n3n conditions of equilibrium (three for each particle) are equal in\r\nnumber to the 3n Cartesian (or other) co-ordinates of the particles,\r\nwhich are to be found. If the system be subject to frictionless\r\nconstraints, e.g. if some of the particles be constrained to lie on\r\nsmooth surfaces, or if pairs of particles be connected by inextensible\r\nstrings, then for each geometrical relation thus introduced we have an\r\nunknown reaction (e.g. the pressure of the smooth surface, or the\r\ntension of the string), so that the problem is still determinate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n  The case of the _funicular polygon_ will be of use to us later. A\r\n  number of particles attached at various points of a string are acted\r\n  on by given extraneous forces P1, P2, P3 ... respectively. The\r\n  relation between the three forces acting on any particle, viz. the\r\n  extraneous force and the tensions in the two adjacent portions of the\r\n  string can be exhibited by means of a triangle of forces; and if the\r\n  successive triangles be drawn to the same scale they can be fitted\r\n  together so as to constitute a single _force-diagram_, as shown in\r\n  fig. 6. This diagram consists of a polygon whose successive sides\r\n  represent the given forces P1, P2, P3 ..., and of a series of lines\r\n  connecting the vertices with a point O. These latter lines measure the\r\n  tensions in the successive portions of string. As a special, but very\r\n  important case, the forces P1, P2, P3 ... may be parallel, e.g. they\r\n  may be the weights of the several particles. The polygon of forces is\r\n  then made up of segments of a vertical line. We note that the tensions\r\n  have now the same horizontal projection (represented by the dotted\r\n  line in fig. 7). It is further of interest to note that if the weights\r\n  be all equal, and at equal horizontal intervals, the vertices of the\r\n  funicular will lie on a parabola whose axis is vertical. To prove this\r\n  statement, let A, B, C, D ... be successive vertices, and let H, K ...\r\n  be the middle points of AC, BD ...; then BH, CK ... will be vertical\r\n  by the hypothesis, and since the geometric sum of [->BA], [->BC] is\r\n  represented by 2[->BH], the tension in BA: tension in BC: weight at B\r\n\r\n  as BA: BC: 2BH.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n  The tensions in the successive portions of the string are therefore\r\n  proportional to the respective lengths, and the lines BH, CK ... are\r\n  all equal. Hence AD, BC are parallel and are bisected by the same\r\n  vertical line; and a parabola with vertical axis can therefore be\r\n  described through A, B, C, D. The same holds for the four points B, C,\r\n  D, E and so on; but since a parabola is uniquely determined by the\r\n  direction of its axis and by three points on the curve, the successive\r\n  parabolas ABCD, BCDE, CDEF ... must be coincident.\r\n\r\n§ 3. _Plane Kinematics of a Rigid Body._--The ideal _rigid body_ is one\r\nin which the distance between any two points is invariable. For the\r\npresent we confine ourselves to the consideration of displacements in\r\ntwo dimensions, so that the body is adequately represented by a thin\r\nlamina or plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe position of a lamina movable in its own plane is determinate when we\r\nknow the positions of any two points A, B of it. Since the four\r\nco-ordinates (Cartesian or other) of these two points are connected by\r\nthe relation which expresses the invariability of the length AB, it is\r\nplain that virtually three independent elements are required and suffice\r\nto specify the position of the lamina. For instance, the lamina may in\r\ngeneral be fixed by connecting any three points of it by rigid links to\r\nthree fixed points in its plane. The three independent elements may be\r\nchosen in a variety of ways (e.g. they may be the lengths of the three\r\nlinks in the above example). They may be called (in a generalized sense)\r\nthe _co-ordinates_ of the lamina. The lamina when perfectly free to move\r\nin its own plane is said to have _three degrees of freedom_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nBy a theorem due to M. Chasles any displacement whatever of the lamina\r\nin its own plane is equivalent to a rotation about some finite or\r\ninfinitely distant point J. For suppose that in consequence of the\r\ndisplacement a point of the lamina is brought from A to B, whilst the\r\npoint of the lamina which was originally at B is brought to C. Since AB,\r\nBC, are two different positions of the same line in the lamina they are\r\nequal, and it is evident that the rotation could have been effected by a\r\nrotation about J, the centre of the circle ABC, through an angle AJB. As\r\na special case the three points A, B, C may be in a straight line; J is\r\nthen at infinity and the displacement is equivalent to a pure\r\n_translation_, since every point of the lamina is now displaced parallel\r\nto AB through a space equal to AB.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nNext, consider any continuous motion of the lamina. The latter may be\r\nbrought from any one of its positions to a neighbouring one by a\r\nrotation about the proper centre. The limiting position J of this\r\ncentre, when the two positions are taken infinitely close to one\r\nanother, is called the _instantaneous centre_. If P, P´ be consecutive\r\npositions of the same point, and [delta][theta] the corresponding angle\r\nof rotation, then ultimately PP´ is at right angles to JP and equal to\r\nJP·[delta][theta]. The instantaneous centre will have a certain locus in\r\nspace, and a certain locus in the lamina. These two loci are called\r\n_pole-curves_ or _centrodes_, and are sometimes distinguished as the\r\n_space-centrode_ and the _body-centrode_, respectively. In the\r\ncontinuous motion in question the latter curve rolls without slipping on\r\nthe former (M. Chasles). Consider in fact any series of successive\r\npositions 1, 2, 3... of the lamina (fig. 11); and let J12, J23, J34...\r\nbe the positions in space of the centres of the rotations by which the\r\nlamina can be brought from the first position to the second, from the\r\nsecond to the third, and so on. Further, in the position 1, let J12,\r\nJ´23, J´34 ... be the points of the lamina which have become the\r\nsuccessive centres of rotation. The given series of positions will be\r\nassumed in succession if we imagine the lamina to rotate first about J12\r\nuntil J´23 comes into coincidence with J23, then about J23 until J´34\r\ncomes into coincidence with J34, and so on. This is equivalent to\r\nimagining the polygon J12 J´23 J´34 ..., supposed fixed in the lamina,\r\nto roll on the polygon J12 J23 J34 ..., which is supposed fixed in\r\nspace. By imagining the successive positions to be taken infinitely\r\nclose to one another we derive the theorem stated. The particular case\r\nwhere both centrodes are circles is specially important in mechanism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n  The theory may be illustrated by the case of \"three-bar motion.\" Let\r\n  ABCD be any quadrilateral formed of jointed links. If, AB being held\r\n  fixed, the quadrilateral be slightly deformed, it is obvious that the\r\n  instantaneous centre J will be at the intersection of the straight\r\n  lines AD, BC, since the displacements of the points D, C are\r\n  necessarily at right angles to AD, BC, respectively. Hence these\r\n  displacements are proportional to JD, JC, and therefore to DD´ CC´,\r\n  where C´D´ is any line drawn parallel to CD, meeting BC, AD in C´, D´,\r\n  respectively. The determination of the centrodes in three-bar motion\r\n  is in general complicated, but in one case, that of the \"crossed\r\n  parallelogram\" (fig. 13), they assume simple forms. We then have AB =\r\n  DC and AD = BC, and from the symmetries of the figure it is plain that\r\n\r\n    AJ + JB = CJ + JD = AD.\r\n\r\n  Hence the locus of J relative to AB, and the locus relative to CD are\r\n  equal ellipses of which A, B and C, D are respectively the foci. It\r\n  may be noticed that the lamina in fig. 9 is not, strictly speaking,\r\n  fixed, but admits of infinitesimal displacement, whenever the\r\n  directions of the three links are concurrent (or parallel).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe matter may of course be treated analytically, but we shall only\r\nrequire the formula for infinitely small displacements. If the origin of\r\nrectangular axes fixed in the lamina be shifted through a space whose\r\nprojections on the original directions of the axes are [lambda], [mu],\r\nand if the axes are simultaneously turned through an angle [epsilon],\r\nthe co-ordinates of a point of the lamina, relative to the original\r\naxes, are changed from x, y to [lambda] + x cos [epsilon] - y sin\r\n[epsilon], [mu] + x sin [epsilon] + y cos [epsilon], or [lambda] + x -\r\ny[epsilon], [mu] + x[epsilon] + y, ultimately. Hence the component\r\ndisplacements are ultimately\r\n\r\n  [delta]x = [lambda] - y[epsilon], [delta]y = [mu] + x[epsilon]  (1)\r\n\r\nIf we equate these to zero we get the co-ordinates of the instantaneous\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n§ 4. _Plane Statics._--The statics of a rigid body rests on the\r\nfollowing two assumptions:--\r\n\r\n(i) A force may be supposed to be applied indifferently at any point in\r\nits line of action. In other words, a force is of the nature of a\r\n\"bound\" or \"localized\" vector; it is regarded as resident in a certain\r\nline, but has no special reference to any particular point of the line.\r\n\r\n(ii) Two forces in intersecting lines may be replaced by a force which\r\nis their geometric sum, acting through the intersection. The theory of\r\nparallel forces is included as a limiting case. For if O, A, B be any\r\nthree points, and m, n any scalar quantities, we have in vectors\r\n\r\n  m · [->OA] + n·[->OB] = (m + n) [->OC],  (1)\r\n\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n  m · [->CA] + n·[->CB] = 0.  (2)\r\n\r\nHence if forces P, Q act in OA, OB, the resultant R will pass through C,\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n  m = P/OA, n = Q/OB;\r\n\r\nalso\r\n\r\n  R = P·OC/OA + Q·OC/OB,  (3)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n  P·AC : Q·CB = OA : OB.  (4)\r\n\r\nThese formulae give a means of constructing the resultant by means of\r\nany transversal AB cutting the lines of action. If we now imagine the\r\npoint O to recede to infinity, the forces P, Q and the resultant R are\r\nparallel, and we have\r\n\r\n  R = P + Q, P·AC = Q·CB.  (5)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nWhen P, Q have opposite signs the point C divides AB externally on the\r\nside of the greater force. The investigation fails when P + Q = 0, since\r\nit leads to an infinitely small resultant acting in an infinitely\r\ndistant line. A combination of two equal, parallel, but oppositely\r\ndirected forces cannot in fact be replaced by anything simpler, and must\r\ntherefore be recognized as an independent entity in statics. It was\r\ncalled by L. Poinsot, who first systematically investigated its\r\nproperties, a _couple_.\r\n\r\nWe now restrict ourselves for the present to the systems of forces in\r\none plane. By successive applications of (ii) any such coplanar system\r\ncan in general be reduced to a _single resultant_ acting in a definite\r\nline. As exceptional cases the system may reduce to a couple, or it may\r\nbe in equilibrium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe _moment_ of a force about a point O is the product of the force into\r\nthe perpendicular drawn to its line of action from O, this perpendicular\r\nbeing reckoned positive or negative according as O lies on one side or\r\nother of the line of action. If we mark off a segment AB along the line\r\nof action so as to represent the force completely, the moment is\r\nrepresented as to magnitude by twice the area of the triangle OAB, and\r\nthe usual convention as to sign is that the area is to be reckoned\r\npositive or negative according as the letters O, A, B, occur in\r\n\"counter-clockwise\" or \"clockwise\" order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe sum of the moments of two forces about any point O is equal to the\r\nmoment of their resultant (P. Varignon, 1687). Let AB, AC (fig. 16)\r\nrepresent the two forces, AD their resultant; we have to prove that the\r\nsum of the triangles OAB, OAC is equal to the triangle OAD, regard being\r\nhad to signs. Since the side OA is common, we have to prove that the sum\r\nof the perpendiculars from B and C on OA is equal to the perpendicular\r\nfrom D on OA, these perpendiculars being reckoned positive or negative\r\naccording as they lie to the right or left of AO. Regarded as a\r\nstatement concerning the orthogonal projections of the vectors [->AB]\r\nand [->AC] (or BD), and of their sum [->AD], on a line perpendicular to\r\nAO, this is obvious.\r\n\r\nIt is now evident that in the process of reduction of a coplanar system\r\nno change is made at any stage either in the sum of the projections of\r\nthe forces on any line or in the sum of their moments about any point.\r\nIt follows that the single resultant to which the system in general\r\nreduces is uniquely determinate, i.e. it acts in a definite line and has\r\na definite magnitude and sense. Again it is necessary and sufficient for\r\nequilibrium that the sum of the projections of the forces on each of two\r\nperpendicular directions should vanish, and (moreover) that the sum of\r\nthe moments about some one point should be zero. The fact that three\r\nindependent conditions must hold for equilibrium is important. The\r\nconditions may of course be expressed in different (but equivalent)\r\nforms; e.g. the sum of the moments of the forces about each of the three\r\npoints which are not collinear must be zero.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nThe particular case of three forces is of interest. If they are not all\r\nparallel they must be concurrent, and their vector-sum must be zero.\r\nThus three forces acting perpendicular to the sides of a triangle at the\r\nmiddle points will be in equilibrium provided they are proportional to\r\nthe respective sides, and act all inwards or all outwards. This result\r\nis easily extended to the case of a polygon of any number of sides; it\r\nhas an important application in hydrostatics.\r\n\r\n  Again, suppose we have a bar AB resting with its ends on two smooth\r\n  inclined planes which face each other. Let G be the centre of gravity\r\n  (§ 11), and let AG = a, GB = b. Let [alpha], [beta] be the\r\n  inclinations of the planes, and [theta] the angle which the bar makes\r\n  with the vertical. The position of equilibrium is determined by the\r\n  consideration that the reactions at A and B, which are by hypothesis\r\n  normal to the planes, must meet at a point J on the vertical through\r\n  G. Hence\r\n\r\n    JG/a = sin ([theta] - [alpha])/sin [alpha], JG/b = sin ([theta] + [beta])/sin [beta],\r\n\r\n  whence\r\n\r\n                  a cot [alpha] - b cot [beta]\r\n    cot [theta] = ----------------------------.  (6)\r\n                            a + b\r\n\r\n  If the bar is uniform we have a = b, and\r\n\r\n    cot [theta] = ½ (cot [alpha] - cot [beta]).  (7)\r\n\r\n  The problem of a rod suspended by strings attached to two points of it\r\n  is virtually identical, the tensions of the strings taking the place\r\n  of the reactions of the planes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nJust as a system of forces is in general equivalent to a single force,\r\nso a given force can conversely be replaced by combinations of other\r\nforces, in various ways. For instance, a given force (and consequently a\r\nsystem of forces) can be replaced in one and only one way by three\r\nforces acting in three assigned straight lines, provided these lines be\r\nnot concurrent or parallel. Thus if the three lines form a triangle ABC,\r\nand if the given force F meet BC in H, then F can be resolved into two\r\ncomponents acting in HA, BC, respectively. And the force in HA can be\r\nresolved into two components acting in BC, CA, respectively. A simple\r\ngraphical construction is indicated in fig. 19, where the dotted lines\r\nare parallel. As an example, any system of forces acting on the lamina\r\nin fig. 9 is balanced by three determinate tensions (or thrusts) in the\r\nthree links, provided the directions of the latter are not concurrent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n  If P, Q, R, be any three forces acting along BC, CA, AB, respectively,\r\n  the line of action of the resultant is determined by the consideration\r\n  that the sum of the moments about any point on it must vanish. Hence\r\n  in \"trilinear\" co-ordinates, with ABC as fundamental triangle, its\r\n  equation is P[alpha] + Q[beta] + R[gamma] = 0. If P : Q : R = a : b :\r\n  c, where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides, this becomes the \"line\r\n  at infinity,\" and the forces reduce to a couple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe sum of the moments of the two forces of a couple is the same about\r\nany point in the plane. Thus in the figure the sum of the moments about\r\nO is P·OA - P·OB or P·AB, which is independent of the position of O.\r\nThis sum is called the _moment of the couple_; it must of course have\r\nthe proper sign attributed to it. It easily follows that any two couples\r\nof the same moment are equivalent, and that any number of couples can be\r\nreplaced by a single couple whose moment is the sum of their moments.\r\nSince a couple is for our purposes sufficiently represented by its\r\nmoment, it has been proposed to substitute the name _torque_ (or\r\ntwisting effort), as free from the suggestion of any special pair of\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nA system of forces represented completely by the sides of a plane\r\npolygon taken in order is equivalent to a couple whose moment is\r\nrepresented by twice the area of the polygon; this is proved by taking\r\nmoments about any point. If the polygon intersects itself, care must be\r\ntaken to attribute to the different parts of the area their proper\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\nAgain, any coplanar system of forces can be replaced by a single force R\r\nacting at any assigned point O, together with a couple G. The force R is\r\nthe geometric sum of the given forces, and the moment (G) of the couple\r\nis equal to the sum of the moments of the given forces about O. The\r\nvalue of G will in general vary with the position of O, and will vanish\r\nwhen O lies on the line of action of the single resultant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe formal analytical reduction of a system of coplanar forces is as\r\nfollows. Let (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... be the rectangular co-ordinates of\r\nany points A1, A2, ... on the lines of action of the respective forces.\r\nThe force at A1 may be replaced by its components X1, Y1, parallel to\r\nthe co-ordinate axes; that at A2 by its components X2, Y2, and so on.\r\nIntroducing at O two equal and opposite forces ±X1 in Ox, we see that X1\r\nat A1 may be replaced by an equal and parallel force at O together with\r\na couple -y1X1. Similarly the force Y1 at A1 may be replaced by a force\r\nY1 at O together with a couple x1Y1. The forces X1, Y1, at O can thus be\r\ntransferred to O provided we introduce a couple x1Y1 - y1X1. Treating\r\nthe remaining forces in the same way we get a force X1 + X2 + ... or\r\n[Sigma](X) along Ox, a force Y1 + Y2 + ... or [Sigma](Y) along Oy, and a\r\ncouple (x1Y1 - y1X1) + (x2Y2 - y2X2) + ... or [Sigma](xY - yX). The\r\nthree conditions of equilibrium are therefore\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](X) = 0, [Sigma](Y) = 0, [Sigma](xY - yX) = 0.  (8)\r\n\r\nIf O´ be a point whose co-ordinates are ([xi], [eta]), the moment of the\r\ncouple when the forces are transferred to O´ as a new origin will be\r\n[Sigma]{(x - [xi]) Y - (y - [eta]) X}. This vanishes, i.e. the system\r\nreduces to a single resultant through O´, provided\r\n\r\n  -[xi]·[Sigma](Y) + [eta]·[Sigma](X) + [Sigma](xY - yX) = 0.  (9)\r\n\r\nIf [xi], [eta] be regarded as current co-ordinates, this is the equation\r\nof the line of action of the single resultant to which the system is in\r\ngeneral reducible.\r\n\r\nIf the forces are all parallel, making say an angle [theta] with Ox, we\r\nmay write X1 = P1 cos [theta], Y1 = P1 sin [theta], X2 = P2 cos [theta],\r\nY2 = P2 sin [theta], .... The equation (9) then becomes\r\n\r\n  {[Sigma](xP) - [xi]·[Sigma](P)} sin [theta] - {[Sigma](yP) - [eta]·[Sigma](P)} cos [theta] = 0.  (10)\r\n\r\nIf the forces P1, P2, ... be turned in the same sense through the same\r\nangle about the respective points A1, A2, ... so as to remain parallel,\r\nthe value of [theta] is alone altered, and the resultant [Sigma](P)\r\npasses always through the point\r\n\r\n         [Sigma](xP)         [Sigma](yP)\r\n  [|x] = -----------, [|y] = -----------,  (11)\r\n          [Sigma](P)          [Sigma](P)\r\n\r\nwhich is determined solely by the configuration of the points A1, A2,\r\n... and by the ratios P1: P2: ... of the forces acting at them\r\nrespectively. This point is called the _centre_ of the given system of\r\nparallel forces; it is finite and determinate unless [Sigma](P) = 0. A\r\ngeometrical proof of this theorem, which is not restricted to a\r\ntwo-dimensional system, is given later (§ 11). It contains the theory of\r\nthe _centre of gravity_ as ordinarily understood. For if we have an\r\nassemblage of particles whose mutual distances are small compared with\r\nthe dimensions of the earth, the forces of gravity on them constitute a\r\nsystem of sensibly parallel forces, sensibly proportional to the\r\nrespective masses. If now the assemblage be brought into any other\r\nposition relative to the earth, without alteration of the mutual\r\ndistances, this is equivalent to a rotation of the directions of the\r\nforces relatively to the assemblage, the ratios of the forces remaining\r\nunaltered. Hence there is a certain point, fixed relatively to the\r\nassemblage, through which the resultant of gravitational action always\r\npasses; this resultant is moreover equal to the sum of the forces on the\r\nseveral particles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\n  The theorem that any coplanar system of forces can be reduced to a\r\n  force acting through any assigned point, together with a couple, has\r\n  an important illustration in the theory of the distribution of\r\n  shearing stress and bending moment in a horizontal beam, or other\r\n  structure, subject to vertical extraneous forces. If we consider any\r\n  vertical section P, the forces exerted across the section by the\r\n  portion of the structure on one side on the portion on the other may\r\n  be reduced to a vertical force F at P and a couple M. The force\r\n  measures the _shearing stress_, and the couple the _bending moment_ at\r\n  P; we will reckon these quantities positive when the senses are as\r\n  indicated in the figure.\r\n\r\n  If the remaining forces acting on the portion of the structure on\r\n  either side of P are known, then resolving vertically we find F, and\r\n  taking moments about P we find M. Again if PQ be any segment of the\r\n  beam which is free from load, Q lying to the right of P, we find\r\n\r\n    F_P = F_Q, M_P - M_Q = -F·PQ;  (12)\r\n\r\n  hence F is constant between the loads, whilst M decreases as we travel\r\n  to the right, with a constant gradient -F. If PQ be a short segment\r\n  containing an isolated load W, we have\r\n\r\n    F_Q - F_P = -W, M_Q = M_P;  (13)\r\n\r\n  hence F is discontinuous at a concentrated load, diminishing by an\r\n  amount equal to the load as we pass the loaded point to the right,\r\n  whilst M is continuous. Accordingly the graph of F for any system of\r\n  isolated loads will consist of a series of horizontal lines, whilst\r\n  that of M will be a continuous polygon.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\n  To pass to the case of continuous loads, let x be measured\r\n  horizontally along the beam to the right. The load on an element\r\n  [delta]x of the beam may be represented by w[delta]x, where w is in\r\n  general a function of x. The equations (12) are now replaced by\r\n\r\n    [delta]F = -w[delta]x, [delta]M = -F[delta]x,\r\n\r\n  whence\r\n                   _                          _\r\n                  / Q                        / Q\r\n    F_Q - F_P = - |   w dx,    M_Q - M_P = - |   F dx.  (14)\r\n                 _/P                        _/P\r\n\r\n  The latter relation shows that the bending moment varies as the area\r\n  cut off by the ordinate in the graph of F. In the case of uniform load\r\n  we have\r\n\r\n    F = -wx + A, M = ½wx² - Ax + B,  (15)\r\n\r\n  where the arbitrary constants A,B are to be determined by the\r\n  conditions of the special problem, e.g. the conditions at the ends of\r\n  the beam. The graph of F is a straight line; that of M is a parabola\r\n  with vertical axis. In all cases the graphs due to different\r\n  distributions of load may be superposed. The figure shows the case of\r\n  a uniform heavy beam supported at its ends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\n§ 5. _Graphical Statics._--A graphical method of reducing a plane system\r\nof forces was introduced by C. Culmann (1864). It involves the\r\nconstruction of two figures, a _force-diagram_ and a _funicular\r\npolygon_. The force-diagram is constructed by placing end to end a\r\nseries of vectors representing the given forces in magnitude and\r\ndirection, and joining the vertices of the polygon thus formed to an\r\narbitrary _pole_ O. The funicular or link polygon has its vertices on\r\nthe lines of action of the given forces, and its sides respectively\r\nparallel to the lines drawn from O in the force-diagram; in particular,\r\nthe two sides meeting in any vertex are respectively parallel to the\r\nlines drawn from O to the ends of that side of the force-polygon which\r\nrepresents the corresponding force. The relations will be understood\r\nfrom the annexed diagram, where corresponding lines in the force-diagram\r\n(to the right) and the funicular (to the left) are numbered similarly.\r\nThe sides of the force-polygon may in the first instance be arranged in\r\nany order; the force-diagram can then be completed in a doubly infinite\r\nnumber of ways, owing to the arbitrary position of O; and for each\r\nforce-diagram a simply infinite number of funiculars can be drawn. The\r\ntwo diagrams being supposed constructed, it is seen that each of the\r\ngiven systems of forces can be replaced by two components acting in the\r\nsides of the funicular which meet at the corresponding vertex, and that\r\nthe magnitudes of these components will be given by the corresponding\r\ntriangle of forces in the force-diagram; thus the force 1 in the figure\r\nis equivalent to two forces represented by 01 and 12. When this process\r\nof replacement is complete, each terminated side of the funicular is the\r\nseat of two forces which neutralize one another, and there remain only\r\ntwo uncompensated forces, viz., those resident in the first and last\r\nsides of the funicular. If these sides intersect, the resultant acts\r\nthrough the intersection, and its magnitude and direction are given by\r\nthe line joining the first and last sides of the force-polygon (see fig.\r\n26, where the resultant of the four given forces is denoted by R). As a\r\nspecial case it may happen that the force-polygon is closed, i.e. its\r\nfirst and last points coincide; the first and last sides of the\r\nfunicular will then be parallel (unless they coincide), and the two\r\nuncompensated forces form a couple. If, however, the first and last\r\nsides of the funicular coincide, the two outstanding forces neutralize\r\none another, and we have equilibrium. Hence the necessary and sufficient\r\nconditions of equilibrium are that the force-polygon and the funicular\r\nshould both be closed. This is illustrated by fig. 26 if we imagine the\r\nforce R, reversed, to be included in the system of given forces.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a system of jointed bars having the shape of the\r\nfunicular polygon would be in equilibrium under the action of the given\r\nforces, supposed applied to the joints; moreover any bar in which the\r\nstress is of the nature of a tension (as distinguished from a thrust)\r\nmight be replaced by a string. This is the origin of the names\r\n\"link-polygon\" and \"funicular\" (cf. § 2).\r\n\r\n  If funiculars be drawn for two positions O, O´ of the pole in the\r\n  force-diagram, their corresponding sides will intersect on a straight\r\n  line parallel to OO´. This is essentially a theorem of projective\r\n  geometry, but the following statical proof is interesting. Let AB\r\n  (fig. 27) be any side of the force-polygon, and construct the\r\n  corresponding portions of the two diagrams, first with O and then with\r\n  O´ as pole. The force corresponding to AB may be replaced by the two\r\n  components marked x, y; and a force corresponding to BA may be\r\n  represented by the two components marked x´, y´. Hence the forces x,\r\n  y, x´, y´ are in equilibrium. Now x, x´ have a resultant through H,\r\n  represented in magnitude and direction by OO´, whilst y, y´ have a\r\n  resultant through K represented in magnitude and direction by O´O.\r\n  Hence HK must be parallel to OO´. This theorem enables us, when one\r\n  funicular has been drawn, to construct any other without further\r\n  reference to the force-diagram.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\n  The complete figures obtained by drawing first the force-diagrams of a\r\n  system of forces in equilibrium with two distinct poles O, O´, and\r\n  secondly the corresponding funiculars, have various interesting\r\n  relations. In the first place, each of these figures may be conceived\r\n  as an orthogonal projection of a closed plane-faced polyhedron. As\r\n  regards the former figure this is evident at once; viz. the polyhedron\r\n  consists of two pyramids with vertices represented by O, O´, and a\r\n  common base whose perimeter is represented by the force-polygon (only\r\n  one of these is shown in fig. 28). As regards the funicular diagram,\r\n  let LM be the line on which the pairs of corresponding sides of the\r\n  two polygons meet, and through it draw any two planes [omega],\r\n  [omega]´. Through the vertices A, B, C, ... and A´, B´, C´, ... of the\r\n  two funiculars draw normals to the plane of the diagram, to meet\r\n  [omega] and [omega]´ respectively. The points thus obtained are\r\n  evidently the vertices of a polyhedron with plane faces.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\n  To every line in either of the original figures corresponds of course\r\n  a parallel line in the other; moreover, it is seen that concurrent\r\n  lines in either figure correspond to lines forming a closed polygon in\r\n  the other. Two plane figures so related are called _reciprocal_, since\r\n  the properties of the first figure in relation to the second are the\r\n  same as those of the second with respect to the first. A still simpler\r\n  instance of reciprocal figures is supplied by the case of concurrent\r\n  forces in equilibrium (fig. 29). The theory of these reciprocal\r\n  figures was first studied by J. Clerk Maxwell, who showed amongst\r\n  other things that a reciprocal can always be drawn to any figure which\r\n  is the orthogonal projection of a plane-faced polyhedron. If in fact\r\n  we take the pole of each face of such a polyhedron with respect to a\r\n  paraboloid of revolution, these poles will be the vertices of a second\r\n  polyhedron whose edges are the \"conjugate lines\" of those of the\r\n  former. If we project both polyhedra orthogonally on a plane\r\n  perpendicular to the axis of the paraboloid, we obtain two figures\r\n  which are reciprocal, except that corresponding lines are orthogonal\r\n  instead of parallel. Another proof will be indicated later (§ 8) in\r\n  connexion with the properties of the linear complex. It is convenient\r\n  to have a notation which shall put in evidence the reciprocal\r\n  character. For this purpose we may designate the points in one figure\r\n  by letters A, B, C, ... and the corresponding polygons in the other\r\n  figure by the same letters; a line joining two points A, B in one\r\n  figure will then correspond to the side common to the two polygons A,\r\n  B in the other. This notation was employed by R. H. Bow in connexion\r\n  with the theory of frames (§ 6, and see also APPLIED MECHANICS below)\r\n  where reciprocal diagrams are frequently of use (cf. DIAGRAM).\r\n\r\n  When the given forces are all parallel, the force-polygon consists of\r\n  a series of segments of a straight line. This case has important\r\n  practical applications; for instance we may use the method to find the\r\n  pressures on the supports of a beam loaded in any given manner. Thus\r\n  if AB, BC, CD represent the given loads, in the force-diagram, we\r\n  construct the sides corresponding to OA, OB, OC, OD in the funicular;\r\n  we then draw the _closing line_ of the funicular polygon, and a\r\n  parallel OE to it in the force diagram. The segments DE, EA then\r\n  represent the upward pressures of the two supports on the beam, which\r\n  pressures together with the given loads constitute a system of forces\r\n  in equilibrium. The pressures of the beam on the supports are of\r\n  course represented by ED, AE. The two diagrams are portions of\r\n  reciprocal figures, so that Bow's notation is applicable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\n  A graphical method can also be applied to find the moment of a force,\r\n  or of a system of forces, about any assigned point P. Let F be a force\r\n  represented by AB in the force-diagram. Draw a parallel through P to\r\n  meet the sides of the funicular which correspond to OA, OB in the\r\n  points H, K. If R be the intersection of these sides, the triangles\r\n  OAB, RHK are similar, and if the perpendiculars OM, RN be drawn we\r\n  have\r\n\r\n    HK·OM = AB·RN = F·RN,\r\n\r\n  which is the moment of F about P. If the given forces are all parallel\r\n  (say vertical) OM is the same for all, and the moments of the several\r\n  forces about P are represented on a certain scale by the lengths\r\n  intercepted by the successive pairs of sides on the vertical through\r\n  P. Moreover, the moments are compounded by adding (geometrically) the\r\n  corresponding lengths HK. Hence if a system of vertical forces be in\r\n  equilibrium, so that the funicular polygon is closed, the length which\r\n  this polygon intercepts on the vertical through any point P gives the\r\n  sum of the moments about P of all the forces on one side of this\r\n  vertical. For instance, in the case of a beam in equilibrium under any\r\n  given loads and the reactions at the supports, we get a graphical\r\n  representation of the distribution of bending moment over the beam.\r\n  The construction in fig. 30 can easily be adjusted so that the closing\r\n  line shall be horizontal; and the figure then becomes identical with\r\n  the bending-moment diagram of § 4. If we wish to study the effects of\r\n  a movable load, or system of loads, in different positions on the\r\n  beam, it is only necessary to shift the lines of action of the\r\n  pressures of the supports relatively to the funicular, keeping them at\r\n  the same, distance apart; the only change is then in the position of\r\n  the closing line of the funicular. It may be remarked that since this\r\n  line joins homologous points of two \"similar\" rows it will envelope a\r\n  parabola.\r\n\r\nThe \"centre\" (§ 4) of a system of parallel forces of given magnitudes,\r\nacting at given points, is easily determined graphically. We have only\r\nto construct the line of action of the resultant for each of two\r\narbitrary directions of the forces; the intersection of the two lines\r\ngives the point required. The construction is neatest if the two\r\narbitrary directions are taken at right angles to one another.\r\n\r\n§ 6. _Theory of Frames._--A _frame_ is a structure made up of pieces, or\r\n_members_, each of which has two _joints_ connecting it with other\r\nmembers. In a two-dimensional frame, each joint may be conceived as\r\nconsisting of a small cylindrical pin fitting accurately and smoothly\r\ninto holes drilled through the members which it connects. This\r\nsupposition is a somewhat ideal one, and is often only roughly\r\napproximated to in practice. We shall suppose, in the first instance,\r\nthat extraneous forces act on the frame at the joints only, i.e. on the\r\npins.\r\n\r\nOn this assumption, the reactions on any member at its two joints must\r\nbe equal and opposite. This combination of equal and opposite forces is\r\ncalled the _stress_ in the member; it may be a _tension_ or a _thrust_.\r\nFor diagrammatic purposes each member is sufficiently represented by a\r\nstraight line terminating at the two joints; these lines will be\r\nreferred to as the _bars_ of the frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nIn structural applications a frame must be _stiff_, or _rigid_, i.e. it\r\nmust be incapable of deformation without alteration of length in at\r\nleast one of its bars. It is said to be _just rigid_ if it ceases to be\r\nrigid when any one of its bars is removed. A frame which has more bars\r\nthan are essential for rigidity may be called _over-rigid_; such a frame\r\nis in general self-stressed, i.e. it is in a state of stress\r\nindependently of the action of extraneous forces. A plane frame of n\r\njoints which is just rigid (as regards deformation in its own plane) has\r\n2n - 3 bars, for if one bar be held fixed the 2(n - 2) co-ordinates of\r\nthe remaining n - 2 joints must just be determined by the lengths of the\r\nremaining bars. The total number of bars is therefore 2(n - 2) + 1. When\r\na plane frame which is just rigid is subject to a given system of\r\nequilibrating extraneous forces (in its own plane) acting on the joints,\r\nthe stresses in the bars are in general uniquely determinate. For the\r\nconditions of equilibrium of the forces on each pin furnish 2n\r\nequations, viz. two for each point, which are linear in respect of the\r\nstresses and the extraneous forces. This system of equations must\r\ninvolve the three conditions of equilibrium of the extraneous forces\r\nwhich are already identically satisfied, by hypothesis; there remain\r\ntherefore 2n - 3 independent relations to determine the 2n - 3 unknown\r\nstresses. A frame of n joints and 2n - 3 bars may of course fail to be\r\nrigid owing to some parts being over-stiff whilst others are deformable;\r\nin such a case it will be found that the statical equations, apart from\r\nthe three identical relations imposed by the equilibrium of the\r\nextraneous forces, are not all independent but are equivalent to less\r\nthan 2n - 3 relations. Another exceptional case, known as the _critical\r\ncase_, will be noticed later (§ 9).\r\n\r\nA plane frame which can be built up from a single bar by successive\r\nsteps, at each of which a new joint is introduced by two new bars\r\nmeeting there, is called a _simple_ frame; it is obviously just rigid.\r\nThe stresses produced by extraneous forces in a simple frame can be\r\nfound by considering the equilibrium of the various joints in a proper\r\nsuccession; and if the graphical method be employed the various polygons\r\nof force can be combined into a single force-diagram. This procedure was\r\nintroduced by W. J. M. Rankine and J. Clerk Maxwell (1864). It may be\r\nnoticed that if we take an arbitrary pole in the force-diagram, and draw\r\na corresponding funicular in the skeleton diagram which represents the\r\nframe together with the lines of action of the extraneous forces, we\r\nobtain two complete reciprocal figures, in Maxwell's sense. It is\r\naccordingly convenient to use Bow's notation (§ 5), and to distinguish\r\nthe several compartments of the frame-diagram by letters. See fig. 33,\r\nwhere the successive triangles in the diagram of forces may be\r\nconstructed in the order XYZ, ZXA, AZB. The class of \"simple\" frames\r\nincludes many of the frameworks used in the construction of roofs,\r\nlattice girders and suspension bridges; a number of examples will be\r\nfound in the article BRIDGES. By examining the senses in which the\r\nrespective forces act at each joint we can ascertain which members are\r\nin tension and which are in thrust; in fig. 33 this is indicated by the\r\ndirections of the arrowheads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\nWhen a frame, though just rigid, is not \"simple\" in the above sense, the\r\npreceding method must be replaced, or supplemented, by one or other of\r\nvarious artifices. In some cases the _method of sections_ is sufficient\r\nfor the purpose. If an ideal section be drawn across the frame, the\r\nextraneous forces on either side must be in equilibrium with the forces\r\nin the bars cut across; and if the section can be drawn so as to cut\r\nonly three bars, the forces in these can be found, since the problem\r\nreduces to that of resolving a given force into three components acting\r\nin three given lines (§ 4). The \"critical case\" where the directions of\r\nthe three bars are concurrent is of course excluded. Another method,\r\nalways available, will be explained under \"Work\" (§ 9).\r\n\r\n  When extraneous forces act on the bars themselves the stress in each\r\n  bar no longer consists of a simple longitudinal tension or thrust. To\r\n  find the reactions at the joints we may proceed as follows. Each\r\n  extraneous force W acting on a bar may be replaced (in an infinite\r\n  number of ways) by two components P, Q in lines through the centres of\r\n  the pins at the extremities. In practice the forces W are usually\r\n  vertical, and the components P, Q are then conveniently taken to be\r\n  vertical also. We first alter the problem by transferring the forces\r\n  P, Q to the pins. The stresses in the bars, in the problem as thus\r\n  modified, may be supposed found by the preceding methods; it remains\r\n  to infer from the results thus obtained the reactions in the original\r\n  form of the problem. To find the pressure exerted by a bar AB on the\r\n  pin A we compound with the force in AB given by the diagram a force\r\n  equal to P. Conversely, to find the pressure of the pin A on the bar\r\n  AB we must compound with the force given by the diagram a force equal\r\n  and opposite to P. This question arises in practice in the theory of\r\n  \"three-jointed\" structures; for the purpose in hand such a structure\r\n  is sufficiently represented by two bars AB, BC. The right-hand figure\r\n  represents a portion of the force-diagram; in particular [->ZX]\r\n  represents the pressure of AB on B in the modified problem where the\r\n  loads W1 and W2 on the two bars are replaced by loads P1, Q1, and P2,\r\n  Q2 respectively, acting on the pins. Compounding with this [->XV],\r\n  which represents Q1, we get the actual pressure [->ZV] exerted by AB\r\n  on B. The directions and magnitudes of the reactions at A and C are\r\n  then easily ascertained. On account of its practical importance\r\n  several other graphical solutions of this problem have been devised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.]\r\n\r\n§ 7. _Three-dimensional Kinematics of a Rigid Body._--The position of a\r\nrigid body is determined when we know the positions of three points A,\r\nB, C of it which are not collinear, for the position of any other point\r\nP is then determined by the three distances PA, PB, PC. The nine\r\nco-ordinates (Cartesian or other) of A, B, C are subject to the three\r\nrelations which express the invariability of the distances BC, CA, AB,\r\nand are therefore equivalent to six independent quantities. Hence a\r\nrigid body not constrained in any way is said to have six degrees of\r\nfreedom. Conversely, any six geometrical relations restrict the body in\r\ngeneral to one or other of a series of definite positions, none of which\r\ncan be departed from without violating the conditions in question. For\r\ninstance, the position of a theodolite is fixed by the fact that its\r\nrounded feet rest in contact with six given plane surfaces. Again, a\r\nrigid three-dimensional frame can be rigidly fixed relatively to the\r\nearth by means of six links.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.]\r\n\r\n  The six independent quantities, or \"co-ordinates,\" which serve to\r\n  specify the position of a rigid body in space may of course be chosen\r\n  in an endless variety of ways. We may, for instance, employ the three\r\n  Cartesian co-ordinates of a particular point O of the body, and three\r\n  angular co-ordinates which express the orientation of the body with\r\n  respect to O. Thus in fig. 36, if OA, OB, OC be three mutually\r\n  perpendicular lines in the solid, we may denote by [theta] the angle\r\n  which OC makes with a fixed direction OZ, by [psi] the azimuth of the\r\n  plane ZOC measured from some fixed plane through OZ, and by [phi] the\r\n  inclination of the plane COA to the plane ZOC. In fig. 36 these\r\n  various lines and planes are represented by their intersections with a\r\n  unit sphere having O as centre. This very useful, although\r\n  unsymmetrical, system of angular co-ordinates was introduced by L.\r\n  Euler. It is exemplified in \"Cardan's suspension,\" as used in\r\n  connexion with a compass-bowl or a gyroscope. Thus in the gyroscope\r\n  the \"flywheel\" (represented by the globe in fig. 37) can turn about a\r\n  diameter OC of a ring which is itself free to turn about a diametral\r\n  axis OX at right angles to the former; this axis is carried by a\r\n  second ring which is free to turn about a fixed diameter OZ, which is\r\n  at right angles to OX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nWe proceed to sketch the theory of the finite displacements of a rigid\r\nbody. It was shown by Euler (1776) that any displacement in which one\r\npoint O of the body is fixed is equivalent to a pure _rotation_ about\r\nsome axis through O. Imagine two spheres of equal radius with O as their\r\ncommon centre, one fixed in the body and moving with it, the other fixed\r\nin space. In any displacement about O as a fixed point, the former\r\nsphere slides over the latter, as in a \"ball-and-socket\" joint. Suppose\r\nthat as the result of the displacement a point of the moving sphere is\r\nbrought from A to B, whilst the point which was at B is brought to C\r\n(cf. fig. 10). Let J be the pole of the circle ABC (usually a \"small\r\ncircle\" of the fixed sphere), and join JA, JB, JC, AB, BC by\r\ngreat-circle arcs. The spherical isosceles triangles AJB, BJC are\r\ncongruent, and we see that AB can be brought into the position BC by a\r\nrotation about the axis OJ through an angle AJB.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.]\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to distinguish the two senses in which rotation may\r\ntake place about an axis OA by opposite signs. We shall reckon a\r\nrotation as positive when it is related to the direction from O to A as\r\nthe direction of rotation is related to that of translation in a\r\nright-handed screw. Thus a negative rotation about OA may be regarded as\r\na positive rotation about OA´, the prolongation of AO. Now suppose that\r\na body receives first a positive rotation [alpha] about OA, and secondly\r\na positive rotation [beta] about OB; and let A, B be the intersections\r\nof these axes with a sphere described about O as centre. If we construct\r\nthe spherical triangles ABC, ABC´ (fig. 38), having in each case the\r\nangles at A and B equal to ½[alpha] and ½[beta] respectively, it is\r\nevident that the first rotation will bring a point from C to C´ and that\r\nthe second will bring it back to C; the result is therefore equivalent\r\nto a rotation about OC. We note also that if the given rotations had\r\nbeen effected in the inverse order, the axis of the resultant rotation\r\nwould have been OC´, so that finite rotations do not obey the\r\n\"commutative law.\" To find the angle of the equivalent rotation, in the\r\nactual case, suppose that the second rotation (about OB) brings a point\r\nfrom A to A´. The spherical triangles ABC, A´BC (fig. 39) are\r\n\"symmetrically equal,\" and the angle of the resultant rotation, viz.\r\nACA´, is 2[pi] - 2C. This is equivalent to a negative rotation 2C about\r\nOC, whence the theorem that the effect of three successive positive\r\nrotations 2A, 2B, 2C about OA, OB, OC, respectively, is to leave the\r\nbody in its original position, provided the circuit ABC is left-handed\r\nas seen from O. This theorem is due to O. Rodrigues (1840). The\r\ncomposition of finite rotations about parallel axes is a particular case\r\nof the preceding; the radius of the sphere is now infinite, and the\r\ntriangles are plane.\r\n\r\nIn any continuous motion of a solid about a fixed point O, the limiting\r\nposition of the axis of the rotation by which the body can be brought\r\nfrom any one of its positions to a consecutive one is called the\r\n_instantaneous axis_. This axis traces out a certain cone in the body,\r\nand a certain cone in space, and the continuous motion in question may\r\nbe represented as consisting in a rolling of the former cone on the\r\nlatter. The proof is similar to that of the corresponding theorem of\r\nplane kinematics (§ 3).\r\n\r\nIt follows from Euler's theorem that the most general displacement of a\r\nrigid body may be effected by a pure translation which brings any one\r\npoint of it to its final position O, followed by a pure rotation about\r\nsome axis through O. Those planes in the body which are perpendicular to\r\nthis axis obviously remain parallel to their original positions. Hence,\r\nif [sigma], [sigma]´ denote the initial and final positions of any\r\nfigure in one of these planes, the displacement could evidently have\r\nbeen effected by (1) a translation perpendicular to the planes in\r\nquestion, bringing [sigma] into some position [sigma]´´ in the plane of\r\n[sigma]´, and (2) a rotation about a normal to the planes, bringing\r\n[sigma]´´ into coincidence with [sigma] (§ 3). In other words, the most\r\ngeneral displacement is equivalent to a translation parallel to a\r\ncertain axis combined with a rotation about that axis; i.e. it may be\r\ndescribed as a _twist_ about a certain _screw_. In particular cases, of\r\ncourse, the translation, or the rotation, may vanish.\r\n\r\n  The preceding theorem, which is due to Michel Chasles (1830), may be\r\n  proved in various other interesting ways. Thus if a point of the body\r\n  be displaced from A to B, whilst the point which was at B is displaced\r\n  to C, and that which was at C to D, the four points A, B, C, D lie on\r\n  a helix whose axis is the common perpendicular to the bisectors of the\r\n  angles ABC, BCD. This is the axis of the required screw; the amount of\r\n  the translation is measured by the projection of AB or BC or CD on the\r\n  axis; and the angle of rotation is given by the inclination of the\r\n  aforesaid bisectors. This construction was given by M. W. Crofton.\r\n  Again, H. Wiener and W. Burnside have employed the _half-turn_ (i.e. a\r\n  rotation through two right angles) as the fundamental operation. This\r\n  has the advantage that it is completely specified by the axis of the\r\n  rotation, the sense being immaterial. Successive half-turns about\r\n  parallel axes a, b are equivalent to a translation measured by double\r\n  the distance between these axes in the direction from a to b.\r\n  Successive half-turns about intersecting axes a, b are equivalent to a\r\n  rotation about the common perpendicular to a, b at their intersection,\r\n  of amount equal to twice the acute angle between them, in the\r\n  direction from a to b. Successive half-turns about two skew axes a, b\r\n  are equivalent to a twist about a screw whose axis is the common\r\n  perpendicular to a, b, the translation being double the shortest\r\n  distance, and the angle of rotation being twice the acute angle\r\n  between a, b, in the direction from a to b. It is easily shown that\r\n  any displacement whatever is equivalent to two half-turns and\r\n  therefore to a screw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nIn mechanics we are specially concerned with the theory of infinitesimal\r\ndisplacements. This is included in the preceding, but it is simpler in\r\nthat the various operations are commutative. An infinitely small\r\nrotation about any axis is conveniently represented geometrically by a\r\nlength AB measures along the axis and proportional to the angle of\r\nrotation, with the convention that the direction from A to B shall be\r\nrelated to the rotation as is the direction of translation to that of\r\nrotation in a right-handed screw. The consequent displacement of any\r\npoint P will then be at right angles to the plane PAB, its amount will\r\nbe represented by double the area of the triangle PAB, and its sense\r\nwill depend on the cyclical order of the letters P, A, B. If AB, AC\r\nrepresent infinitesimal rotations about intersecting axes, the\r\nconsequent displacement of any point O in the plane BAC will be at right\r\nangles to this plane, and will be represented by twice the sum of the\r\nareas OAB, OAC, taken with proper signs. It follows by analogy with the\r\ntheory of moments (§ 4) that the resultant rotation will be represented\r\nby AD, the vector-sum of AB, AC (see fig. 16). It is easily inferred as\r\na limiting case, or proved directly, that two infinitesimal rotations\r\n[alpha], [beta] about parallel axes are equivalent to a rotation [alpha]\r\n+ [beta] about a parallel axis in the same plane with the two former,\r\nand dividing a common perpendicular AB in a point C so that AC/CB =\r\n[beta]/[alpha]. If the rotations are equal and opposite, so that [alpha]\r\n+ [beta] = 0, the point C is at infinity, and the effect is a\r\ntranslation perpendicular to the plane of the two given axes, of amount\r\n[alpha]·AB. It thus appears that an infinitesimal rotation is of the\r\nnature of a \"localized vector,\" and is subject in all respects to the\r\nsame mathematical laws as a force, conceived as acting on a rigid body.\r\nMoreover, that an infinitesimal translation is analogous to a couple and\r\nfollows the same laws. These results are due to Poinsot.\r\n\r\nThe analytical treatment of small displacements is as follows. We first\r\nsuppose that one point O of the body is fixed, and take this as the\r\norigin of a \"right-handed\" system of rectangular co-ordinates; i.e. the\r\npositive directions of the axes are assumed to be so arranged that a\r\npositive rotation of 90° about Ox would bring Oy into the position of\r\nOz, and so on. The displacement will consist of an infinitesimal\r\nrotation [epsilon] about some axis through O, whose direction-cosines\r\nare, say, l, m, n. From the equivalence of a small rotation to a\r\nlocalized vector it follows that the rotation [epsilon] will be\r\nequivalent to rotations [xi], [eta], [zeta] about Ox, Oy, Oz,\r\nrespectively, provided\r\n\r\n  [xi] = l[epsilon], [eta] = m[epsilon], [zeta] = n[epsilon],  (1)\r\n\r\nand we note that\r\n\r\n  [xi]² + [eta]² + [zeta]² = [epsilon]².  (2)\r\n\r\n  Thus in the case of fig. 36 it may be required to connect the\r\n  infinitesimal rotations [xi], [eta], [zeta] about OA, OB, OC with the\r\n  variations of the angular co-ordinates [theta], [psi], [phi]. The\r\n  displacement of the point C of the body is made up of [delta][theta]\r\n  tangential to the meridian ZC and sin [theta] [delta][psi]\r\n  perpendicular to the plane of this meridian. Hence, resolving along\r\n  the tangents to the arcs BC, CA, respectively, we have\r\n\r\n    [xi] = [delta][theta] sin [phi] - sin [theta] [delta][psi] cos [phi],\r\n    [eta] = [delta][theta] cos [phi] + sin [theta] [delta][psi] sin [phi].  (3)\r\n\r\n  Again, consider the point of the solid which was initially at A´ in\r\n  the figure. This is displaced relatively to A´ through a space\r\n  [delta][psi] perpendicular to the plane of the meridian, whilst A´\r\n  itself is displaced through a space cos [theta] [delta][psi] in the\r\n  same direction. Hence\r\n\r\n    [zeta] = [delta][phi] + cos [theta] [delta][psi].  (4)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.]\r\n\r\nTo find the component displacements of a point P of the body, whose\r\nco-ordinates are x, y, z, we draw PL normal to the plane yOz, and LH, LK\r\nperpendicular to Oy, Oz, respectively. The displacement of P parallel to\r\nOx is the same as that of L, which is made up of [eta]z and -[zeta]y. In\r\nthis way we obtain the formulae\r\n\r\n  [delta]x = [eta]z - [zeta]y, [delta]y = [zeta]x - [xi]z, [delta]z = [xi]y - [eta]x.      (5)\r\n\r\nThe most general case is derived from this by adding the component\r\ndisplacements [lambda], [mu], [nu] (say) of the point which was at O;\r\nthus\r\n\r\n  [delta]x = [lambda] + [eta]z  - [zeta]y,  \\\r\n  [delta]y = [mu]     + [zeta]x - [xi]z,     >  (6)\r\n  [delta]z = [nu]     + [xi]y   - [eta]x.   /\r\n\r\nThe displacement is thus expressed in terms of the six independent\r\nquantities [xi], [eta], [zeta], [lambda], [mu], [nu]. The points whose\r\ndisplacements are in the direction of the resultant axis of rotation are\r\ndetermined by [delta]x:[delta]y:[delta]z = [xi]:[eta]:[zeta], or\r\n\r\n  ([lambda] + [eta]z - [zeta]y)/([xi] = [mu] + [zeta]x - [xi]z)/[eta] = ([nu] + [xi]y - [eta]x)/[zeta].  (7)\r\n\r\nThese are the equations of a straight line, and the displacement is in\r\nfact equivalent to a twist about a screw having this line as axis. The\r\ntranslation parallel to this axis is\r\n\r\n  l[delta]x + m[delta]y + n[delta]z = ([lambda][xi] + [mu][eta] + [nu][zeta])/[epsilon].  (8)\r\n\r\nThe linear magnitude which measures the ratio of translation to rotation\r\nin a screw is called the _pitch_. In the present case the pitch is\r\n\r\n  ([lambda][xi] + [mu][eta] + [nu][zeta])/([xi]² + [eta]² + [zeta]²).  (9)\r\n\r\nSince [xi]² + [eta]² + [zeta]², or [epsilon]², is necessarily an\r\nabsolute invariant for all transformations of the (rectangular)\r\nco-ordinate axes, we infer that [lambda][xi] + [mu][eta] + [nu][zeta] is\r\nalso an absolute invariant. When the latter invariant, but not the\r\nformer, vanishes, the displacement is equivalent to a pure rotation.\r\n\r\n  If the small displacements of a rigid body be subject to one\r\n  constraint, e.g. if a point of the body be restricted to lie on a\r\n  given surface, the mathematical expression of this fact leads to a\r\n  homogeneous linear equation between the infinitesimals [xi], [eta],\r\n  [zeta], [lambda], [mu], [nu], say\r\n\r\n    A[xi] + B[eta] + C[zeta] + F[lambda] + G[mu] + H[nu] = 0.  (10)\r\n\r\n  The quantities [xi], [eta], [zeta], [lambda], [mu], [nu] are no longer\r\n  independent, and the body has now only five degrees of freedom. Every\r\n  additional constraint introduces an additional equation of the type\r\n  (10) and reduces the number of degrees of freedom by one. In Sir R. S.\r\n  Ball's _Theory of Screws_ an analysis is made of the possible\r\n  displacements of a body which has respectively two, three, four, five\r\n  degrees of freedom. We will briefly notice the case of two degrees,\r\n  which involves an interesting generalization of the method (already\r\n  explained) of compounding rotations about intersecting axes. We assume\r\n  that the body receives arbitrary twists about two given screws, and\r\n  it is required to determine the character of the resultant\r\n  displacement. We examine first the case where the axes of the two\r\n  screws are at right angles and intersect. We take these as axes of x\r\n  and y; then if [xi], [eta] be the component rotations about them, we\r\n  have\r\n\r\n    [lambda] = h[xi], [mu] = k[eta], [nu] = 0,  (11)\r\n\r\n  where h, k, are the pitches of the two given screws. The equations (7)\r\n  of the axis of the resultant screw then reduce to\r\n\r\n    x/[xi] = y/[eta], z([xi]² + [eta]²) = (k - h)[xi][eta].  (12)\r\n\r\n  Hence, whatever the ratio [xi] : [eta], the axis of the resultant\r\n  screw lies on the conoidal surface\r\n\r\n   z(x² + y²) = cxy,  (13)\r\n\r\n  where c = ½(k - h). The co-ordinates of any point on (13) may be\r\n  written\r\n\r\n   x = r cos [theta], y = r sin [theta], z = c sin 2[theta];  (14)\r\n\r\n  hence if we imagine a curve of sines to be traced on a circular\r\n  cylinder so that the circumference just includes two complete\r\n  undulations, a straight line cutting the axis of the cylinder at right\r\n  angles and meeting this curve will generate the surface. This is\r\n  called a _cylindroid_. Again, the pitch of the resultant screw is\r\n\r\n    p = ([lambda][xi] + [mu][eta])/([xi]² + [eta]²) = h cos² [theta] + k sin² [theta].  (15)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Sir Robert S. Ball's _Theory of Screws_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 41.]\r\n\r\n  The distribution of pitch among the various screws has therefore a\r\n  simple relation to the _pitch-conic_\r\n\r\n    hx² + ky² = const;  (16)\r\n\r\n  viz. the pitch of any screw varies inversely as the square of that\r\n  diameter of the conic which is parallel to its axis. It is to be\r\n  noticed that the parameter c of the cylindroid is unaltered if the two\r\n  pitches h, k be increased by equal amounts; the only change is that\r\n  all the pitches are increased by the same amount. It remains to show\r\n  that a system of screws of the above type can be constructed so as to\r\n  contain any two given screws whatever. In the first place, a\r\n  cylindroid can be constructed so as to have its axis coincident with\r\n  the common perpendicular to the axes of the two given screws and to\r\n  satisfy three other conditions, for the position of the centre, the\r\n  parameter, and the orientation about the axis are still at our\r\n  disposal. Hence we can adjust these so that the surface shall contain\r\n  the axes of the two given screws as generators, and that the\r\n  difference of the corresponding pitches shall have the proper value.\r\n  It follows that when a body has two degrees of freedom it can twist\r\n  about any one of a singly infinite system of screws whose axes lie on\r\n  a certain cylindroid. In particular cases the cylindroid may\r\n  degenerate into a plane, the pitches being then all equal.\r\n\r\n§ 8. _Three-dimensional Statics._--A system of parallel forces can be\r\ncombined two and two until they are replaced by a single resultant equal\r\nto their sum, acting in a certain line. As special cases, the system may\r\nreduce to a couple, or it may be in equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, a three-dimensional system of forces cannot be\r\nreplaced by a single resultant force. But it may be reduced to simpler\r\nelements in a variety of ways. For example, it may be reduced to two\r\nforces in perpendicular skew lines. For consider any plane, and let each\r\nforce, at its intersection with the plane, be resolved into two\r\ncomponents, one (P) normal to the plane, the other (Q) in the plane. The\r\nassemblage of parallel forces P can be replaced in general by a single\r\nforce, and the coplanar system of forces Q by another single force.\r\n\r\nIf the plane in question be chosen perpendicular to the direction of the\r\nvector-sum of the given forces, the vector-sum of the components Q is\r\nzero, and these components are therefore equivalent to a couple (§ 4).\r\nHence any three-dimensional system can be reduced to a single force R\r\nacting in a certain line, together with a couple G in a plane\r\nperpendicular to the line. This theorem was first given by L. Poinsot,\r\nand the line of action of R was called by him the _central axis_ of the\r\nsystem. The combination of a force and a couple in a perpendicular plane\r\nis termed by Sir R. S. Ball a _wrench_. Its type, as distinguished from\r\nits absolute magnitude, may be specified by a screw whose axis is the\r\nline of action of R, and whose pitch is the ratio G/R.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.]\r\n\r\n  The case of two forces may be specially noticed. Let AB be the\r\n  shortest distance between the lines of action, and let AA´, BB´ (fig.\r\n  42) represent the forces. Let [alpha], [beta] be the angles which AA´,\r\n  BB´ make with the direction of the vector-sum, on opposite sides.\r\n  Divide AB in O, so that\r\n\r\n    AA´·cos [alpha]·AO = BB´·cos [beta]·OB,  (1)\r\n\r\n  and draw OC parallel to the vector-sum. Resolving AA´, BB´ each into\r\n  two components parallel and perpendicular to OC, we see that the\r\n  former components have a single resultant in OC, of amount\r\n\r\n    R = AA´ cos [alpha] + BB´ cos [beta],  (2)\r\n\r\n  whilst the latter components form a couple of moment\r\n\r\n    G = AA´·AB·sin [alpha] = BB´·AB·sin [beta].  (3)\r\n\r\n  Conversely it is seen that any wrench can be replaced in an infinite\r\n  number of ways by two forces, and that the line of action of one of\r\n  these may be chosen quite arbitrarily. Also, we find from (2) and (3)\r\n  that\r\n\r\n    G·R = AA´·BB´·AB·sin ([alpha] + [beta]).  (4)\r\n\r\n  The right-hand expression is six times the volume of the tetrahedron\r\n  of which the lines AA´, BB´ representing the forces are opposite\r\n  edges; and we infer that, in whatever way the wrench be resolved into\r\n  two forces, the volume of this tetrahedron is invariable.\r\n\r\nTo define the _moment_ of a force _about an axis_ HK, we project the\r\nforce orthogonally on a plane perpendicular to HK and take the moment of\r\nthe projection about the intersection of HK with the plane (see § 4).\r\nSome convention as to sign is necessary; we shall reckon the moment to\r\nbe positive when the tendency of the force is right-handed as regards\r\nthe direction from H to K. Since two concurrent forces and their\r\nresultant obviously project into two concurrent forces and their\r\nresultant, we see that the sum of the moments of two concurrent forces\r\nabout any axis HK is equal to the moment of their resultant. Parallel\r\nforces may be included in this statement as a limiting case. Hence, in\r\nwhatever way one system of forces is by successive steps replaced by\r\nanother, no change is made in the sum of the moments about any assigned\r\naxis. By means of this theorem we can show that the previous reduction\r\nof any system to a wrench is unique.\r\n\r\nFrom the analogy of couples to translations which was pointed out in §\r\n7, we may infer that a couple is sufficiently represented by a \"free\"\r\n(or non-localized) vector perpendicular to its plane. The length of the\r\nvector must be proportional to the moment of the couple, and its sense\r\nmust be such that the sum of the moments of the two forces of the couple\r\nabout it is positive. In particular, we infer that couples of the same\r\nmoment in parallel planes are equivalent; and that couples in any two\r\nplanes may be compounded by geometrical addition of the corresponding\r\nvectors. Independent statical proofs are of course easily given. Thus,\r\nlet the plane of the paper be perpendicular to the planes of two\r\ncouples, and therefore perpendicular to the line of intersection of\r\nthese planes. By § 4, each couple can be replaced by two forces ± P\r\n(fig. 43) perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and so that one force\r\nof each couple is in the line of intersection (B); the arms (AB, BC)\r\nwill then be proportional to the respective moments. The two forces at B\r\nwill cancel, and we are left with a couple of moment P · AC in the plane\r\nAC. If we draw three vectors to represent these three couples, they will\r\nbe perpendicular and proportional to the respective sides of the\r\ntriangle ABC; hence the third vector is the geometric sum of the other\r\ntwo. Since, in this proof the magnitude of P is arbitrary, It follows\r\nincidentally that couples of the same moment in parallel planes, e.g.\r\nplanes parallel to AC, are equivalent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.]\r\n\r\nHence a couple of moment G, whose axis has the direction (l, m, n)\r\nrelative to a right-handed system of rectangular axes, is equivalent to\r\nthree couples lG, mG, nG in the co-ordinate planes. The analytical\r\nreduction of a three-dimensional system can now be conducted as follows.\r\nLet (x1, y1, z1) be the co-ordinates of a point P1 on the line of action\r\nof one of the forces, whose components are (say) X1, Y1, Z1. Draw P1H\r\nnormal to the plane zOx, and HK perpendicular to Oz. In KH introduce two\r\nequal and opposite forces ± X1. The force X1 at P1 with -X1 in KH forms\r\na couple about Oz, of moment -y1X1. Next, introduce along Ox two equal\r\nand opposite forces ±X1. The force X1 in KH with -X1 in Ox forms a\r\ncouple about Oy, of moment z1X1. Hence the force X1 can be transferred\r\nfrom P1 to O, provided we introduce couples of moments z1X1 about Oy and\r\n-y1X1, about Oz. Dealing in the same way with the forces Y1, Z1 at P1,\r\nwe find that all three components of the force at P1 can be transferred\r\nto O, provided we introduce three couples L1, M1, N1 about Ox, Oy, Oz\r\nrespectively, viz.\r\n\r\n  L1 = y1Z1 - z1Y1,  M1 = z1X1 - x1Z1,  N1 = x1Y1 - y1X1.  (5)\r\n\r\nIt is seen that L1, M1, N1 are the moments of the original force at P1\r\nabout the co-ordinate axes. Summing up for all the forces of the given\r\nsystem, we obtain a force R at O, whose components are\r\n\r\n  X = [Sigma](X_r),  Y = [Sigma](Y_r),  Z = [Sigma](Z_r),  (6)\r\n\r\nand a couple G whose components are\r\n\r\n  L = [Sigma](L_r),  M = [Sigma](M_r),  N = [Sigma](N_r),  (7)\r\n\r\nwhere r= 1, 2, 3 ... Since R² = X² + Y² + Z², G² = L² + M² + N², it is\r\nnecessary and sufficient for equilibrium that the six quantities X, Y,\r\nZ, L, M, N, should all vanish. In words: the sum of the projections of\r\nthe forces on each of the co-ordinate axes must vanish; and, the sum of\r\nthe moments of the forces about each of these axes must vanish.\r\n\r\nIf any other point O´, whose co-ordinates are x, y, z, be chosen in\r\nplace of O, as the point to which the forces are transferred, we have to\r\nwrite x1 - x, y1 - y, z1 - z for x1, y1, z1, and so on, in the preceding\r\nprocess. The components of the resultant force R are unaltered, but the\r\nnew components of couple are found to be\r\n\r\n  L´ = L - yZ + zY,  \\\r\n  M´ = M - zX + xZ,   >  (8)\r\n  N´ = N - xY + yX.  /\r\n\r\nBy properly choosing O´ we can make the plane of the couple\r\nperpendicular to the resultant force. The conditions for this are L´ :\r\nM´ : N´ = X : Y : Z, or\r\n\r\n  L - yZ + zY   M - zX + xZ   N - xY + yX\r\n  ----------- = ----------- = -----------  (9)\r\n       X             Y             Z\r\n\r\nThese are the equations of the central axis. Since the moment of the\r\nresultant couple is now\r\n\r\n        X         Y        Z       LX + MY + NZ\r\n  G´ = --- L´ +  --- M´ + --- N´ = ------------,  (10)\r\n        R         R        R             R\r\n\r\nthe pitch of the equivalent wrench is\r\n\r\n  (LX + MY + NZ)/(X² + Y² + Z²).\r\n\r\nIt appears that X² + Y² + Z² and LX + MY + NZ are absolute invariants\r\n(cf. § 7). When the latter invariant, but not the former, vanishes, the\r\nsystem reduces to a single force.\r\n\r\nThe analogy between the mathematical relations of infinitely small\r\ndisplacements on the one hand and those of force-systems on the other\r\nenables us immediately to convert any theorem in the one subject into a\r\ntheorem in the other. For example, we can assert without further proof\r\nthat any infinitely small displacement may be resolved into two\r\nrotations, and that the axis of one of these can be chosen arbitrarily.\r\nAgain, that wrenches of arbitrary amounts about two given screws\r\ncompound into a wrench the locus of whose axis is a cylindroid.\r\n\r\n  The mathematical properties of a twist or of a wrench have been the\r\n  subject of many remarkable investigations, which are, however, of\r\n  secondary importance from a physical point of view. In the\r\n  \"Null-System\" of A. F. Möbius (1790-1868), a line such that the moment\r\n  of a given wrench about it is zero is called a _null-line_. The triply\r\n  infinite system of null-lines form what is called in line-geometry a\r\n  \"complex.\" As regards the configuration of this complex, consider a\r\n  line whose shortest distance from the central axis is r, and whose\r\n  inclination to the central axis is [theta]. The moment of the\r\n  resultant force R of the wrench about this line is - Rr sin [theta],\r\n  and that of the couple G is G cos [theta]. Hence the line will be a\r\n  null-line provided\r\n\r\n    tan [theta] = k/r,  (11)\r\n\r\n  where k is the pitch of the wrench. The null-lines which are at a\r\n  given distance r from a point O of the central axis will therefore\r\n  form one system of generators of a hyperboloid of revolution; and by\r\n  varying r we get a series of such hyperboloids with a common centre\r\n  and axis. By moving O along the central axis we obtain the whole\r\n  complex of null-lines. It appears also from (11) that the null-lines\r\n  whose distance from the central axis is r are tangent lines to a\r\n  system of helices of slope tan^-1 (r/k); and it is to be noticed that\r\n  these helices are left-handed if the given wrench is right-handed, and\r\n  vice versa.\r\n\r\n  Since the given wrench can be replaced by a force acting through any\r\n  assigned point P, and a couple, the locus of the null-lines through P\r\n  is a plane, viz. a plane perpendicular to the vector which represents\r\n  the couple. The complex is therefore of the type called \"linear\" (in\r\n  relation to the degree of this locus). The plane in question is called\r\n  the _null-plane_ of P. If the null-plane of P pass through Q, the\r\n  null-plane of Q will pass through P, since PQ is a null-line. Again,\r\n  any plane [omega] is the locus of a system of null-lines meeting in a\r\n  point, called the _null-point_ of [omega]. If a plane revolve about a\r\n  fixed straight line p in it, its null-point describes another straight\r\n  line p´, which is called the _conjugate line_ of p. We have seen that\r\n  the wrench may be replaced by two forces, one of which may act in any\r\n  arbitrary line p. It is now evident that the second force must act in\r\n  the conjugate line p´, since every line meeting p, p´ is a null-line.\r\n  Again, since the shortest distance between any two conjugate lines\r\n  cuts the central axis at right angles, the orthogonal projections of\r\n  two conjugate lines on a plane perpendicular to the central axis will\r\n  be parallel (fig. 42). This property was employed by L. Cremona to\r\n  prove the existence under certain conditions of \"reciprocal figures\"\r\n  in a plane (§ 5). If we take any polyhedron with plane faces, the\r\n  null-planes of its vertices with respect to a given wrench will form\r\n  another polyhedron, and the edges of the latter will be conjugate (in\r\n  the above sense) to those of the former. Projecting orthogonally on a\r\n  plane perpendicular to the central axis we obtain two reciprocal\r\n  figures.\r\n\r\n  In the analogous theory of infinitely small displacements of a solid,\r\n  a \"null-line\" is a line such that the lengthwise displacement of any\r\n  point on it is zero.\r\n\r\n  Since a wrench is defined by six independent quantities, it can in\r\n  general be replaced by any system of forces which involves six\r\n  adjustable elements. For instance, it can in general be replaced by\r\n  six forces acting in six given lines, e.g. in the six edges of a given\r\n  tetrahedron. An exception to the general statement occurs when the six\r\n  lines are such that they are possible lines of action of a system of\r\n  six forces in equilibrium; they are then said to be _in involution_.\r\n  The theory of forces in involution has been studied by A. Cayley, J.\r\n  J. Sylvester and others. We have seen that a rigid structure may in\r\n  general be rigidly connected with the earth by six links, and it now\r\n  appears that any system of forces acting on the structure can in\r\n  general be balanced by six determinate forces exerted by the links.\r\n  If, however, the links are in involution, these forces become infinite\r\n  or indeterminate. There is a corresponding kinematic peculiarity, in\r\n  that the connexion is now not strictly rigid, an infinitely small\r\n  relative displacement being possible. See § 9.\r\n\r\nWhen parallel forces of given magnitudes act at given points, the\r\nresultant acts through a definite point, or _centre of parallel forces_,\r\nwhich is independent of the special direction of the forces. If P_r be\r\nthe force at (x_r, y_r, z_r), acting in the direction (l, m, n), the\r\nformulae (6) and (7) reduce to\r\n\r\n  X = [Sigma](P).l,  Y = [Sigma](P).m,  Z = [Sigma](P).n,  (12)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n  L = [Sigma](P)·(n[|y] - m[|z]), M = [Sigma](P)·(l[|z] - n[|x]), N = [Sigma](P)·(m[|x] - l[|y]),  (13)\r\n\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n         [Sigma](Px)         [Sigma](Py)         [Sigma](Pz)\r\n  [|x] = -----------, [|y] = -----------, [|z] = -----------.  (14)\r\n         [Sigma](P)          [Sigma](P)          [Sigma](P)\r\n\r\nThese are the same as if we had a single force [Sigma](P) acting at the\r\npoint ([|x], [|y], [|z]), which is the same for all directions (l, m,\r\nn). We can hence derive the theory of the centre of gravity, as in § 4.\r\nAn exceptional case occurs when [Sigma](P) = 0.\r\n\r\n  If we imagine a rigid body to be acted on at given points by forces of\r\n  given magnitudes in directions (not all parallel) which are fixed in\r\n  space, then as the body is turned about the resultant wrench will\r\n  assume different configurations in the body, and will in certain\r\n  positions reduce to a single force. The investigation of such\r\n  questions forms the subject of \"Astatics,\" which has been cultivated\r\n  by Möbius, Minding, G. Darboux and others. As it has no physical\r\n  bearing it is passed over here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.]\r\n\r\n§ 9. _Work._--The _work_ done by a force acting on a particle, in any\r\ninfinitely small displacement, is defined as the product of the force\r\ninto the orthogonal projection of the displacement on the direction of\r\nthe force; i.e. it is equal to F·[delta]s cos [theta], where F is the\r\nforce, [delta]s the displacement, and [theta] is the angle between the\r\ndirections of F and [delta]s. In the language of vector analysis (q.v.)\r\nit is the \"scalar product\" of the vector representing the force and the\r\ndisplacement. In the same way, the work done by a force acting on a\r\nrigid body in any infinitely small displacement of the body is the\r\nscalar product of the force into the displacement of any point on the\r\nline of action. This product is the same whatever point on the line of\r\naction be taken, since the lengthwise components of the displacements of\r\nany two points A, B on a line AB are equal, to the first order of small\r\nquantities. To see this, let A´, B´ be the displaced positions of A, B,\r\nand let [phi] be the infinitely small angle between AB and A´B´. Then if\r\n[alpha], [beta] be the orthogonal projections of A´, B´ on AB, we have\r\n\r\n  A[alpha] - B[beta] = AB - [alpha][beta] = AB(1 - cos [phi]) = ½AB·[phi]²,\r\n\r\nultimately. Since this is of the second order, the products F·A[alpha]\r\nand F·B[beta] are ultimately equal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.]\r\n\r\nThe total work done by two concurrent forces acting on a particle, or on\r\na rigid body, in any infinitely small displacement, is equal to the work\r\nof their resultant. Let AB, AC (fig. 46) represent the forces, AD their\r\nresultant, and let AH be the direction of the displacement [delta]s of\r\nthe point A. The proposition follows at once from the fact that the sum\r\nof orthogonal projections of [->AB], [->AC] on AH is equal to the\r\nprojection of [->AD]. It is to be noticed that AH need not be in the\r\nsame plane with AB, AC.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the preceding statements that any two systems of forces\r\nwhich are statically equivalent, according to the principles of §§ 4, 8,\r\nwill (to the first order of small quantities) do the same amount of work\r\nin any infinitely small displacement of a rigid body to which they may\r\nbe applied. It is also evident that the total work done in two or more\r\nsuccessive infinitely small displacements is equal to the work done in\r\nthe resultant displacement.\r\n\r\nThe work of a couple in any infinitely small rotation of a rigid body\r\nabout an axis perpendicular to the plane of the couple is equal to the\r\nproduct of the moment of the couple into the angle of rotation, proper\r\nconventions as to sign being observed. Let the couple consist of two\r\nforces P, P (fig. 47) in the plane of the paper, and let J be the point\r\nwhere this plane is met by the axis of rotation. Draw JBA perpendicular\r\nto the lines of action, and let [epsilon] be the angle of rotation. The\r\nwork of the couple is\r\n\r\n  P·JA·[epsilon] - P·JB·[epsilon] = P·AB·[epsilon] = G[epsilon],\r\n\r\nif G be the moment of the couple.\r\n\r\nThe analytical calculation of the work done by a system of forces in any\r\ninfinitesimal displacement is as follows. For a two-dimensional system\r\nwe have, in the notation of §§ 3, 4,\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](X[delta]x + Y[delta]y) = [Sigma]{X([lambda] - y[epsilon]) + Y([mu] + x[epsilon])}\r\n                                 = [Sigma](X)·[lambda] + [Sigma](Y)·[mu] + [Sigma](xY - yX)[epsilon]\r\n                                 = X[lambda] + Y[mu] + N[epsilon].      (1)\r\n\r\nAgain, for a three-dimensional system, in the notation of §§ 7, 8,\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](X[delta]x + Y[delta]y + Z[delta]z)\r\n  = [Sigma]{(X([lambda] + [eta]z - [zeta]y) + Y([mu] + [zeta]x - [xi]x) + Z([nu] + [xi]y - [eta]x)}\r\n  = [Sigma](X)·[lambda] + [Sigma](Y)·[mu] + [Sigma](Z)·[nu] + [Sigma](yZ - zY)·[xi]\r\n     + [Sigma](zX - xZ)·[eta] + [Sigma](xY - yX)·[zeta]\r\n  = X[lambda] + Y[mu] + Z[nu] + L[xi] + M[eta] + N[zeta].  (2)\r\n\r\nThis expression gives the work done by a given wrench when the body\r\nreceives a given infinitely small twist; it must of course be an\r\nabsolute invariant for all transformations of rectangular axes. The\r\nfirst three terms express the work done by the components of a force (X,\r\nY, Z) acting at O, and the remaining three terms express the work of a\r\ncouple (L, M, N).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.]\r\n\r\n  The work done by a wrench about a given screw, when the body twists\r\n  about a second given screw, may be calculated directly as follows. In\r\n  fig. 48 let R, G be the force and couple of the wrench,\r\n  [epsilon],[tau] the rotation and translation in the twist. Let the\r\n  axes of the wrench and the twist be inclined at an angle [theta], and\r\n  let h be the shortest distance between them. The displacement of the\r\n  point H in the figure, resolved in the direction of R, is [tau] cos\r\n  [theta] - [epsilon]h sin [theta]. The work is therefore\r\n\r\n    R([tau] cos [theta] - [epsilon]h sin [theta]) + G cos [theta]\r\n      = R[epsilon]{(p + p´) cos [theta] - h sin [theta]},  (3)\r\n\r\n  if G = pR, [tau] = p´[epsilon], i.e. p, p´ are the pitches of the two\r\n  screws. The factor (p + p´) cos[theta] - h sin[theta] is called the\r\n  _virtual coefficient_ of the two screws which define the types of the\r\n  wrench and twist, respectively.\r\n\r\n  A screw is determined by its axis and its pitch, and therefore\r\n  involves five Independent elements. These may be, for instance, the\r\n  five ratios [xi]:[eta]:[zeta]:[lambda]:[mu]:[nu] of the six quantities\r\n  which specify an infinitesimal twist about the screw. If the twist is\r\n  a pure rotation, these quantities are subject to the relation\r\n\r\n    [lambda][xi] + [mu][eta] + [nu][zeta] = 0.  (4)\r\n\r\n  In the analytical investigations of line geometry, these six\r\n  quantities, supposed subject to the relation (4), are used to specify\r\n  a line, and are called the six \"co-ordinates\" of the line; they are of\r\n  course equivalent to only four independent quantities. If a line is a\r\n  null-line with respect to the wrench (X, Y, Z, L, M, N), the work done\r\n  in an infinitely small rotation about it is zero, and its co-ordinates\r\n  are accordingly subject to the further relation\r\n\r\n    L[xi] + M[eta] + N[zeta] + X[lambda] + Y[mu] + Z[nu] = 0,  (5)\r\n\r\n  where the coefficients are constant. This is the equation of a \"linear\r\n  complex\" (cf. § 8).\r\n\r\n  Two screws are _reciprocal_ when a wrench about one does no work on a\r\n  body which twists about the other. The condition for this is\r\n\r\n    [lambda][xi]´ + [mu][eta]´ + [nu][zeta]´ + [lambda]´[xi] + [mu]´[eta] + [nu]´[zeta] = 0,  (6)\r\n\r\n  if the screws be defined by the ratios [xi] : [eta] : [zeta] :\r\n  [lambda] : [mu] : [nu] and [xi]´ : [eta]´ : [zeta]´ : [lambda]´ :\r\n  [mu]´ : [nu]´, respectively. The theory of the screw-systems which are\r\n  reciprocal to one, two, three, four given screws respectively has been\r\n  investigated by Sir R. S. Ball.\r\n\r\nConsidering a rigid body in any given position, we may contemplate the\r\nwhole group of infinitesimal displacements which might be given to it.\r\nIf the extraneous forces are in equilibrium the total work which they\r\nwould perform in any such displacement would be zero, since they reduce\r\nto a zero force and a zero couple. This is (in part) the celebrated\r\nprinciple of _virtual velocities_, now often described as the principle\r\nof _virtual work_, enunciated by John Bernoulli (1667-1748). The word\r\n\"virtual\" is used because the displacements in question are not regarded\r\nas actually taking place, the body being in fact at rest. The\r\n\"velocities\" referred to are the velocities of the various points of the\r\nbody in any imagined motion of the body through the position in\r\nquestion; they obviously bear to one another the same ratios as the\r\ncorresponding infinitesimal displacements. Conversely, we can show that\r\nif the virtual work of the extraneous forces be zero for every\r\ninfinitesimal displacement of the body as rigid, these forces must be in\r\nequilibrium. For by giving the body (in imagination) a displacement of\r\ntranslation we learn that the sum of the resolved parts of the forces in\r\nany assigned direction is zero, and by giving it a displacement of pure\r\nrotation we learn that the sum of the moments about any assigned axis is\r\nzero. The same thing follows of course from the analytical expression\r\n(2) for the virtual work. If this vanishes for all values of [lambda],\r\n[mu], [nu], [xi], [eta], [zeta] we must have X, Y, Z, L, M, N = 0, which\r\nare the conditions of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe principle can of course be extended to any system of particles or\r\nrigid bodies, connected together in any way, provided we take into\r\naccount the internal stresses, or reactions, between the various parts.\r\nEach such reaction consists of two equal and opposite forces, both of\r\nwhich may contribute to the equation of virtual work.\r\n\r\nThe proper significance of the principle of virtual work, and of its\r\nconverse, will appear more clearly when we come to kinetics (§ 16); for\r\nthe present it may be regarded merely as a compact and (for many\r\npurposes) highly convenient summary of the laws of equilibrium. Its\r\nspecial value lies in this, that by a suitable adjustment of the\r\nhypothetical displacements we are often enabled to eliminate unknown\r\nreactions. For example, in the case of a particle lying on a smooth\r\ncurve, or on a smooth surface, if it be displaced along the curve, or on\r\nthe surface, the virtual work of the normal component of the pressure\r\nmay be ignored, since it is of the second order. Again, if two bodies\r\nare connected by a string or rod, and if the hypothetical displacements\r\nbe adjusted so that the distance between the points of attachment is\r\nunaltered, the corresponding stress may be ignored. This is evident from\r\nfig. 45; if AB, A´B´ represent the two positions of a string, and T be\r\nthe tension, the virtual work of the two forces ±T at A, B is T(A[alpha]\r\n- B[beta]), which was shown to be of the second order. Again, the normal\r\npressure between two surfaces disappears from the equation, provided the\r\ndisplacements be such that one of these surfaces merely slides\r\nrelatively to the other. It is evident, in the first place, that in any\r\ndisplacement common to the two surfaces, the work of the two equal and\r\nopposite normal pressures will cancel; moreover if, one of the surfaces\r\nbeing fixed, an infinitely small displacement shifts the point of\r\ncontact from A to B, and if A´ be the new position of that point of the\r\nsliding body which was at A, the projection of AA´ on the normal at A is\r\nof the second order. It is to be noticed, in this case, that the\r\ntangential reaction (if any) between the two surfaces is not eliminated.\r\nAgain, if the displacements be such that one curved surface rolls\r\nwithout sliding on another, the reaction, whether normal or tangential,\r\nat the point of contact may be ignored. For the virtual work of two\r\nequal and opposite forces will cancel in any displacement which is\r\ncommon to the two surfaces; whilst, if one surface be fixed, the\r\ndisplacement of that point of the rolling surface which was in contact\r\nwith the other is of the second order. We are thus able to imagine a\r\ngreat variety of mechanical systems to which the principle of virtual\r\nwork can be applied without any regard to the internal stresses,\r\nprovided the hypothetical displacements be such that none of the\r\nconnexions of the system are violated.\r\n\r\nIf the system be subject to gravity, the corresponding part of the\r\nvirtual work can be calculated from the displacement of the centre of\r\ngravity. If W1, W2, ... be the weights of a system of particles, whose\r\ndepths below a fixed horizontal plane of reference are z1, z2, ...,\r\nrespectively, the virtual work of gravity is\r\n\r\n  W1[delta]·z1 + W2[delta]z2 + ... = [delta](W1z1 + W2z2 + ...)  (7)\r\n                                   = (W1 + W2 + ...) [delta][|z],\r\n\r\nwhere [|z] is the depth of the centre of gravity (see § 8 (14) and § 11\r\n(6)). This expression is the same as if the whole mass were concentrated\r\nat the centre of gravity, and displaced with this point. An important\r\nconclusion is that in any displacement of a system of bodies in\r\nequilibrium, such that the virtual work of all forces except gravity may\r\nbe ignored, the depth of the centre of gravity is \"stationary.\"\r\n\r\nThe question as to stability of equilibrium belongs essentially to\r\nkinetics; but we may state by anticipation that in cases where gravity\r\nis the only force which does work, the equilibrium of a body or system\r\nof bodies is stable only if the depth of the centre of gravity be a\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.]\r\n\r\n  Consider, for instance, the case of a bar resting with its ends on two\r\n  smooth inclines (fig. 18). If the bar be displaced in a vertical plane\r\n  so that its ends slide on the two inclines, the instantaneous centre\r\n  is at the point J. The displacement of G is at right angles to JG;\r\n  this shows that for equilibrium JG must be vertical. Again, the locus\r\n  of G is an arc of an ellipse whose centre is in the intersection of\r\n  the planes; since this arc is convex upwards the equilibrium is\r\n  unstable. A general criterion for the case of a rigid body movable in\r\n  two dimensions, with one degree of freedom, can be obtained as\r\n  follows. We have seen (§ 3) that the sequence of possible positions is\r\n  obtained if we imagine the \"body-centrode\" to roll on the\r\n  \"space-centrode.\" For equilibrium, the altitude of the centre of\r\n  gravity G must be stationary; hence G must lie in the same vertical\r\n  line with the point of contact J of the two curves. Further, it is\r\n  known from the theory of \"roulettes\" that the locus of G will be\r\n  concave or convex upwards according as\r\n\r\n    cos[phi]     1       1\r\n    -------- = ----- + ------,  (8)\r\n       h       [rho]   [rho]´\r\n\r\n  where [rho], [rho]´ are the radii of curvature of the two curves at J,\r\n  [phi] is the inclination of the common tangent at J to the horizontal,\r\n  and h is the height of G above J. The signs of [rho], [rho]´ are to be\r\n  taken positive when the curvatures are as in the standard case shown\r\n  in fig. 49. Hence for stability the upper sign must obtain in (8). The\r\n  same criterion may be arrived at in a more intuitive manner as\r\n  follows. If the body be supposed to roll (say to the right) until the\r\n  curves touch at J´, and if JJ´ = [delta]s, the angle through which the\r\n  upper figure rotates is [delta]s/[rho] + [delta]s/[rho]´, and the\r\n  horizontal displacement of G is equal to the product of this\r\n  expression into h. If this displacement be less than the horizontal\r\n  projection of JJ´, viz. [delta]s cos[phi], the vertical through the\r\n  new position of G will fall to the left of J´ and gravity will tend to\r\n  restore the body to its former position. It is here assumed that the\r\n  remaining forces acting on the body in its displaced position have\r\n  zero moment about J´; this is evidently the case, for instance, in the\r\n  problem of \"rocking stones.\"\r\n\r\nThe principle of virtual work is specially convenient in the theory of\r\nframes (§ 6), since the reactions at smooth joints and the stresses in\r\ninextensible bars may be left out of account. In particular, in the case\r\nof a frame which is just rigid, the principle enables us to find the\r\nstress in any one bar independently of the rest. If we imagine the bar\r\nin question to be removed, equilibrium will still persist if we\r\nintroduce two equal and opposite forces S, of suitable magnitude, at the\r\njoints which it connected. In any infinitely small deformation of the\r\nframe as thus modified, the virtual work of the forces S, together with\r\nthat of the original extraneous forces, must vanish; this determines S.\r\n\r\n  As a simple example, take the case of a light frame, whose bars form\r\n  the slides of a rhombus ABCD with the diagonal BD, suspended from A\r\n  and carrying a weight W at C; and let it be required to find the\r\n  stress in BD. If we remove the bar BD, and apply two equal and\r\n  opposite forces S at B and D, the equation is\r\n\r\n    W·[delta](2l cos[theta]) + 2S·[delta](l sin [theta]) = 0,\r\n\r\n  where l is the length of a side of the rhombus, and [theta] its\r\n  inclination to the vertical. Hence\r\n\r\n    S = W tan [theta] = W·BD/AC.  (8)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 50.]\r\n\r\n  The method is specially appropriate when the frame, although just\r\n  rigid, is not \"simple\" in the sense of § 6, and when accordingly the\r\n  method of reciprocal figures is not immediately available. To avoid\r\n  the intricate trigonometrical calculations which would often be\r\n  necessary, graphical devices have been introduced by H. Müller-Breslau\r\n  and others. For this purpose the infinitesimal displacements of the\r\n  various joints are replaced by finite lengths proportional to them,\r\n  and therefore proportional to the velocities of the joints in some\r\n  imagined motion of the deformable frame through its actual\r\n  configuration; this is really (it may be remarked) a reversion to the\r\n  original notion of \"virtual velocities.\" Let J be the instantaneous\r\n  centre for any bar CD (fig. 12), and let s1, s2 represent the virtual\r\n  velocities of C, D. If these lines be turned through a right angle in\r\n  the same sense, they take up positions such as CC´, DD´, where C´, D´\r\n  are on JC, JD, respectively, and C´D´ is parallel to CD. Further, if\r\n  F1 (fig. 51) be any force acting on the joint C, its virtual work will\r\n  be equal to the moment of F1 about C´; the equation of virtual work is\r\n  thus transformed into an equation of moments.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 51.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 52.]\r\n\r\n  Consider, for example, a frame whose sides form the six sides of a\r\n  hexagon ABCDEF and the three diagonals AD, BE, CF; and suppose that it\r\n  is required to find the stress in CF due to a given system of\r\n  extraneous forces in equilibrium, acting on the joints. Imagine the\r\n  bar CF to be removed, and consider a deformation in which AB is fixed.\r\n  The instantaneous centre of CD will be at the intersection of AD, BC,\r\n  and if C´D´ be drawn parallel to CD, the lines CC´, DD´ may be taken\r\n  to represent the virtual velocities of C, D turned each through a\r\n  right angle. Moreover, if we draw D´E´ parallel to DE, and E´F´\r\n  parallel to EF, the lines CC´, DD´, EE´, FF´ will represent on the\r\n  same scale the virtual velocities of the points C, D, E, F,\r\n  respectively, turned each through a right angle. The equation of\r\n  virtual work is then formed by taking moments about C´, D´, E´, F´ of\r\n  the extraneous forces which act at C, D, E, F, respectively. Amongst\r\n  these forces we must include the two equal and opposite forces S which\r\n  take the place of the stress in the removed bar FC.\r\n\r\n  The above method lends itself naturally to the investigation of the\r\n  _critical forms_ of a frame whose general structure is given. We have\r\n  seen that the stresses produced by an equilibrating system of\r\n  extraneous forces in a frame which is just rigid, according to the\r\n  criterion of § 6, are in general uniquely determinate; in particular,\r\n  when there are no extraneous forces the bars are in general free from\r\n  stress. It may however happen that owing to some special relation\r\n  between the lengths of the bars the frame admits of an infinitesimal\r\n  deformation. The simplest case is that of a frame of three bars, when\r\n  the three joints A, B, C fall into a straight line; a small\r\n  displacement of the joint B at right angles to AC would involve\r\n  changes in the lengths of AB, BC which are only of the second order of\r\n  small quantities. Another example is shown in fig. 53. The graphical\r\n  method leads at once to the detection of such cases. Thus in the\r\n  hexagonal frame of fig. 52, if an infinitesimal deformation is\r\n  possible without removing the bar CF, the instantaneous centre of CF\r\n  (when AB is fixed) will be at the intersection of AF and BC, and since\r\n  CC´, FF´ represent the virtual velocities of the points C, F, turned\r\n  each through a right angle, C´F´ must be parallel to CF. Conversely,\r\n  if this condition be satisfied, an infinitesimal deformation is\r\n  possible. The result may be generalized into the statement that a\r\n  frame has a critical form whenever a frame of the same structure can\r\n  be designed with corresponding bars parallel, but without complete\r\n  geometric similarity. In the case of fig. 52 it may be shown that an\r\n  equivalent condition is that the six points A, B, C, D, E, F should\r\n  lie on a conic (M. W. Crofton). This is fulfilled when the opposite\r\n  sides of the hexagon are parallel, and (as a still more special case)\r\n  when the hexagon is regular.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 53.]\r\n\r\n  When a frame has a critical form it may be in a state of stress\r\n  independently of the action of extraneous forces; moreover, the\r\n  stresses due to extraneous forces are indeterminate, and may be\r\n  infinite. For suppose as before that one of the bars is removed. If\r\n  there are no extraneous forces the equation of virtual work reduces to\r\n  S·[delta]s = 0, where S is the stress in the removed bar, and [delta]s\r\n  is the change in the distance between the joints which it connected.\r\n  In a critical form we have [delta]s = 0, and the equation is satisfied\r\n  by an arbitrary value of S; a consistent system of stresses in the\r\n  remaining bars can then be found by preceding rules. Again, when\r\n  extraneous forces P act on the joints, the equation is\r\n\r\n    [Sigma](P·[delta]p) + S·[delta]s = 0,\r\n\r\n  where [delta]p is the displacement of any joint in the direction of\r\n  the corresponding force P. If [Sigma](P·[delta]p) = 0, the stresses\r\n  are merely indeterminate as before; but if [Sigma] (P·[delta]p) does\r\n  not vanish, the equation cannot be satisfied by any finite value of S,\r\n  since [delta]s = 0. This means that, if the material of the frame were\r\n  absolutely unyielding, no finite stresses in the bars would enable it\r\n  to withstand the extraneous forces. With actual materials, the frame\r\n  would yield elastically, until its configuration is no longer\r\n  \"critical.\" The stresses in the bars would then be comparatively very\r\n  great, although finite. The use of frames which approximate to a\r\n  critical form is of course to be avoided in practice.\r\n\r\n  A brief reference must suffice to the theory of three dimensional\r\n  frames. This is important from a technical point of view, since all\r\n  structures are practically three-dimensional. We may note that a frame\r\n  of n joints which is just rigid must have 3n - 6 bars; and that the\r\n  stresses produced in such a frame by a given system of extraneous\r\n  forces in equilibrium are statically determinate, subject to the\r\n  exception of \"critical forms.\"\r\n\r\n§ 10. _Statics of Inextensible Chains._--The theory of bodies or\r\nstructures which are deformable in their smallest parts belongs properly\r\nto elasticity (q.v.). The case of inextensible strings or chains is,\r\nhowever, so simple that it is generally included in expositions of pure\r\nstatics.\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that the form can be sufficiently represented by a plane\r\ncurve, that the stress (tension) at any point P of the curve, between\r\nthe two portions which meet there, is in the direction of the tangent at\r\nP, and that the forces on any linear element [delta]s must satisfy the\r\nconditions of equilibrium laid down in § 1. It follows that the forces\r\non any finite portion will satisfy the conditions of equilibrium which\r\napply to the case of a rigid body (§ 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.]\r\n\r\nWe will suppose in the first instance that the curve is plane. It is\r\noften convenient to resolve the forces on an element PQ (= [delta]s) in\r\nthe directions of the tangent and normal respectively. If T, T +\r\n[delta]T be the tensions at P, Q, and [delta][psi] be the angle between\r\nthe directions of the curve at these points, the components of the\r\ntensions along the tangent at P give (T + [delta]T) cos [psi] - T, or\r\n[delta]T, ultimately; whilst for the component along the normal at P we\r\nhave (T + [delta]T) sin [delta][psi], or T[delta][psi], or\r\nT[delta]s/[rho], where [rho] is the radius of curvature.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for example, that we have a light string stretched over a\r\nsmooth curve; and let R[delta]s denote the normal pressure (outwards\r\nfrom the centre of curvature) on [delta]s. The two resolutions give\r\n[delta]T = 0, T[delta][psi] = R[delta]s, or\r\n\r\n  T = const., R = T/[rho].  (1)\r\n\r\nThe tension is constant, and the pressure per unit length varies as the\r\ncurvature.\r\n\r\nNext suppose that the curve is \"rough\"; and let F[delta]s be the\r\ntangential force of friction on [delta]s. We have [delta]T ± F[delta]s =\r\n0, T[delta][psi] = R[delta]s, where the upper or lower sign is to be\r\ntaken according to the sense in which F acts. We assume that in\r\nlimiting equilibrium we have F = [mu]R, everywhere, where [mu] is the\r\ncoefficient of friction. If the string be on the point of slipping in\r\nthe direction in which [psi] increases, the lower sign is to be taken;\r\nhence [delta]T = F[delta]s = [mu]T[delta][psi], whence\r\n\r\n  T = T0 e^([mu][psi]),  (2)\r\n\r\nif T0 be the tension corresponding to [psi] = 0. This illustrates the\r\nresistance to dragging of a rope coiled round a post; e.g. if we put\r\n[mu] = .3, [psi] = 2[pi], we find for the change of tension in one turn\r\nT/T0 = 6.5. In two turns this ratio is squared, and so on.\r\n\r\nAgain, take the case of a string under gravity, in contact with a smooth\r\ncurve in a vertical plane. Let [psi] denote the inclination to the\r\nhorizontal, and w [delta]s the weight of an element [delta]s. The\r\ntangential and normal components of w[delta]s are -s sin [psi] and\r\n-w [delta]s cos [psi]. Hence\r\n\r\n  [delta]T = w [delta]s sin [psi],  T [delta][psi] = w [delta]s cos [psi] + R[delta]s.  (3)\r\n\r\nIf we take rectangular axes Ox, Oy, of which Oy is drawn vertically\r\nupwards, we have [delta]y = sin[psi] [delta]s, whence [delta]T =\r\nw[delta]y. If the string be uniform, w is constant, and\r\n\r\n  T = wy + const. = w(y - y0),  (4)\r\n\r\nsay; hence the tension varies as the height above some fixed level (y0).\r\nThe pressure is then given by the formula\r\n\r\n        d[psi]\r\n  R = T ------ - w cos [psi].  (5)\r\n          ds\r\n\r\nIn the case of a chain hanging freely under gravity it is usually\r\nconvenient to formulate the conditions of equilibrium of a finite\r\nportion PQ. The forces on this reduce to three, viz. the weight of PQ\r\nand the tensions at P, Q. Hence these three forces will be concurrent,\r\nand their ratios will be given by a triangle of forces. In particular,\r\nif we consider a length AP beginning at the lowest point A, then\r\nresolving horizontally and vertically we have\r\n\r\n  T cos [psi] = T0, T sin [psi] = W,  (6)\r\n\r\nwhere T0 is the tension at A, and W is the weight of PA. The former\r\nequation expresses that the horizontal tension is constant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.]\r\n\r\nIf the chain be uniform we have W = ws, where s is the arc AP: hence ws\r\n= T0 tan[psi]. If we write T0 = wa, so that a is the length of a portion\r\nof the chain whose weight would equal the horizontal tension, this\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n  s = a tan [psi].  (7)\r\n\r\nThis is the \"intrinsic\" equation of the curve. If the axes of x and y be\r\ntaken horizontal and vertical (upwards), we derive\r\n\r\n  x = a log (sec [psi] + tan [psi]), y = a sec [psi].  (8)\r\n\r\nEliminating [psi] we obtain the Cartesian equation\r\n\r\n              x\r\n  y = a cosh ---  (9)\r\n              a\r\n\r\nof the _common catenary_, as it is called (fig. 56). The omission of the\r\nadditive arbitrary constants of integration in (8) is equivalent to a\r\nspecial choice of the origin O of co-ordinates; viz. O is at a distance\r\na vertically below the lowest point ([psi] = 0) of the curve. The\r\nhorizontal line through O is called the _directrix_. The relations\r\n\r\n  s = a sinh x/a,  y² = a² + s²,  T = T0 sec [psi] = wy,  (10)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.]\r\n\r\nwhich are involved in the preceding formulae are also noteworthy. It is\r\na classical problem in the calculus of variations to deduce the equation\r\n(9) from the condition that the depth of the centre of gravity of a\r\nchain of given length hanging between fixed points must be stationary (§\r\n9). The length a is called the _parameter_ of the catenary; it\r\ndetermines the scale of the curve, all catenaries being geometrically\r\nsimilar. If weights be suspended from various points of a hanging chain,\r\nthe intervening portions will form arcs of equal catenaries, since the\r\nhorizontal tension (wa) is the same for all. Again, if a chain pass over\r\na perfectly smooth peg, the catenaries in which it hangs on the two\r\nsides, though usually of different parameters, will have the same\r\ndirectrix, since by (10) y is the same for both at the peg.\r\n\r\n  As an example of the use of the formulae we may determine the maximum\r\n  span for a wire of given material. The condition is that the tension\r\n  must not exceed the weight of a certain length [lambda] of the wire.\r\n  At the ends we shall have y = [lambda], or\r\n\r\n                       x\r\n    [lambda] = a cosh ---,  (11)\r\n                       a\r\n\r\n  and the problem is to make x a maximum for variations of a.\r\n  Differentiating (11) we find that, if dx/da = 0,\r\n\r\n     x        x\r\n    --- tanh --- = 1.  (12)\r\n     a        a\r\n\r\n  It is easily seen graphically, or from a table of hyperbolic tangents,\r\n  that the equation u tanh u = 1 has only one positive root (u = 1.200);\r\n  the span is therefore\r\n\r\n    2x = 2au = 2[lambda]/sinh u = 1.326[lambda],\r\n\r\n  and the length of wire is\r\n\r\n    2s = 2[lambda]/u = 1.667 [lambda].\r\n\r\n  The tangents at the ends meet on the directrix, and their inclination\r\n  to the horizontal is 56° 30´.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 57.]\r\n\r\n  The relation between the sag, the tension, and the span of a wire\r\n  (e.g. a telegraph wire) stretched nearly straight between two points\r\n  A, B at the same level is determined most simply from first\r\n  principles. If T be the tension, W the total weight, k the sag in the\r\n  middle, and [psi] the inclination to the horizontal at A or B, we have\r\n  2T[psi] = W, AB = 2[rho][psi], approximately, where [rho] is the\r\n  radius of curvature. Since 2k[rho] = (½AB)², ultimately, we have\r\n\r\n    k = (1/8)W·AB/T.  (13)\r\n\r\n  The same formula applies if A, B be at different levels, provided k be\r\n  the sag, measured vertically, half way between A and B.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the theory of suspension bridges the case where the\r\nweight of any portion of the chain varies as its horizontal projection\r\nis of interest. The vertical through the centre of gravity of the arc AP\r\n(see fig. 55) will then bisect its horizontal projection AN; hence if PS\r\nbe the tangent at P we shall have AS = SN. This property is\r\ncharacteristic of a parabola whose axis is vertical. If we take A as\r\norigin and AN as axis of x, the weight of AP may be denoted by wx, where\r\nw is the weight per unit length at A. Since PNS is a triangle of forces\r\nfor the portion AP of the chain, we have wx/T0 = PN/NS, or\r\n\r\n  y = w·x²/2T0,  (14)\r\n\r\nwhich is the equation of the parabola in question. The result might of\r\ncourse have been inferred from the theory of the parabolic funicular in\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\n  Finally, we may refer to the _catenary of uniform strength_, where the\r\n  cross-section of the wire (or cable) is supposed to vary as the\r\n  tension. Hence w, the weight per foot, varies as T, and we may write\r\n  T = w[lambda], where [lambda] is a constant length. Resolving along\r\n  the normal the forces on an element [delta]s, we find T[delta][psi] =\r\n  w[delta]s cos[psi], whence\r\n\r\n          ds\r\n    p = ------ = [lambda] sec [psi].  (15)\r\n        d[psi]\r\n\r\n  From this we derive\r\n\r\n                                               x\r\n    x = [lambda][psi], y = [lambda] log sec --------,  (16)\r\n                                            [lambda]\r\n\r\n  where the directions of x and y are horizontal and vertical, and the\r\n  origin is taken at the lowest point. The curve (fig. 58) has two\r\n  vertical asymptotes x = ± ½[pi][lambda]; this shows that however the\r\n  thickness of a cable be adjusted there is a limit [pi][lambda] to the\r\n  horizontal span, where [lambda] depends on the tensile strength of the\r\n  material. For a uniform catenary the limit was found above to be\r\n  1.326[lambda].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.]\r\n\r\nFor investigations relating to the equilibrium of a string in three\r\ndimensions we must refer to the textbooks. In the case of a string\r\nstretched over a smooth surface, but in other respects free from\r\nextraneous force, the tensions at the ends of a small element [delta]s\r\nmust be balanced by the normal reaction of the surface. It follows that\r\nthe osculating plane of the curve formed by the string must contain the\r\nnormal to the surface, i.e. the curve must be a \"geodesic,\" and that the\r\nnormal pressure per unit length must vary as the principal curvature of\r\nthe curve.\r\n\r\n§ 11. _Theory of Mass-Systems._--This is a purely geometrical subject.\r\nWe consider a system of points P1, P2 ..., P_n, with which are\r\nassociated certain coefficients m1, m2, ... m_n, respectively. In the\r\napplication to mechanics these coefficients are the masses of particles\r\nsituate at the respective points, and are therefore all positive. We\r\nshall make this supposition in what follows, but it should be remarked\r\nthat hardly any difference is made in the theory if some of the\r\ncoefficients have a different sign from the rest, except in the special\r\ncase where [Sigma](m) = 0. This has a certain interest in magnetism.\r\n\r\nIn a given mass-system there exists one and only one point G such that\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](m·[->GP]) = 0.  (1)\r\n\r\nFor, take any point O, and construct the vector\r\n\r\n           [Sigma](m·[->OP])\r\n  [->OG] = -----------------.  (2)\r\n               [Sigma](m)\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](m·[->GP]) = [Sigma]{m([->GO] + [->OP])} = [Sigma](m)·[->GO] + [Sigma](m)·[->OP] = 0.  (3)\r\n\r\nAlso there cannot be a distinct point G´ such that [Sigma](m·G´P) = 0,\r\nfor we should have, by subtraction,\r\n\r\n  [Sigma]{m([->GP] + [->PG´])} = 0, or [Sigma](m)·GG´ = 0;  (4)\r\n\r\ni.e. G´ must coincide with G. The point G determined by (1) is called\r\nthe _mass-centre_ or _centre of inertia_ of the given system. It is\r\neasily seen that, in the process of determining the mass-centre, any\r\ngroup of particles may be replaced by a single particle whose mass is\r\nequal to that of the group, situate at the mass-centre of the group.\r\n\r\nIf through P1, P2, ... P_n we draw any system of parallel planes meeting\r\na straight line OX in the points M1, M2 ... M_n, the collinear vectors\r\n[->OM1], [->OM2] ... [->OM_n] may be called the \"projections\" of\r\n[->OP1], [->OP2], ... [->OP_n] on OX. Let these projections be denoted\r\nalgebraically by x1, x2, ... x_n, the sign being positive or negative\r\naccording as the direction is that of OX or the reverse. Since the\r\nprojection of a vector-sum is the sum of the projections of the several\r\nvectors, the equation (2) gives\r\n\r\n         [Sigma](mx)\r\n  [|x] = -----------,  (5)\r\n         [Sigma](m)\r\n\r\nif [|x] be the projection of [->OG]. Hence if the Cartesian co-ordinates\r\nof P1, P2, ... P_n relative to any axes, rectangular or oblique be (x1,\r\ny1, z1), (x2, y2, z2), ..., (x_n, y_n, z_n), the mass-centre ([|x],\r\n[|y], [|z]) is determined by the formulae\r\n\r\n         [Sigma](mx)         [Sigma](my)         [Sigma](mz)\r\n  [|x] = -----------, [|y] = -----------, [|z] = -----------.  (6)\r\n         [Sigma](m)          [Sigma](m)          [Sigma](m)\r\n\r\nIf we write x = [|x] + [xi], y = [|y] + [eta], z = [|z] + [zeta], so\r\nthat [xi], [eta], [zeta] denote co-ordinates relative to the mass-centre\r\nG, we have from (6)\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](m[xi]) = 0, [Sigma](m[eta]) = 0, [Sigma](m[zeta]) = 0.  (7)\r\n\r\n  One or two special cases may be noticed. If three masses [alpha],\r\n  [beta], [gamma] be situate at the vertices of a triangle ABC, the\r\n  mass-centre of [beta] and [gamma] is at a point A´ in BC, such that\r\n  [beta]·BA´ = [gamma]·A´C. The mass-centre (G) of [alpha], [beta],\r\n  [gamma] will then divide AA´ so that [alpha]·AG = ([beta] + [gamma])\r\n  GA´. It is easily proved that\r\n\r\n    [alpha] : [beta] : [gamma] = [Delta]BGA : [Delta]GCA : [Delta]GAB;\r\n\r\n  also, by giving suitable values (positive or negative) to the ratios\r\n  [alpha] : [beta] : [gamma] we can make G assume any assigned position\r\n  in the plane ABC. We have here the origin of the \"barycentric\r\n  co-ordinates\" of Möbius, now usually known as \"areal\" co-ordinates. If\r\n  [alpha] + [beta] + [gamma] = 0, G is at infinity; if [alpha] = [beta]\r\n  = [gamma], G is at the intersection of the median lines of the\r\n  triangle; if [alpha] : [beta] : [gamma] = a : b : c, G is at the\r\n  centre of the inscribed circle. Again, if G be the mass-centre of four\r\n  particles [alpha], [beta], [gamma], [delta] situate at the vertices of\r\n  a tetrahedron ABCD, we find\r\n\r\n    [alpha] : [beta] : [gamma] : [delta] = tet^n GBCD : tet^n GCDA : tet^n GDAB : tet^n GABC,\r\n\r\n  and by suitable determination of the ratios on the left hand we can\r\n  make G assume any assigned position in space. If [alpha] + [beta] +\r\n  [gamma] + [delta] = O, G is at infinity; if [alpha] = [beta] = [gamma]\r\n  = [delta], G bisects the lines joining the middle points of opposite\r\n  edges of the tetrahedron ABCD; if [alpha] : [beta] : [gamma] : [delta]\r\n  = [Delta]BCD : [Delta]CDA : [Delta]DAB : [Delta]ABC, G is at the\r\n  centre of the inscribed sphere.\r\n\r\n  If we have a continuous distribution of matter, instead of a system of\r\n  discrete particles, the summations in (6) are to be replaced by\r\n  integrations. Examples will be found in textbooks of the calculus and\r\n  of analytical statics. As particular cases: the mass-centre of a\r\n  uniform thin triangular plate coincides with that of three equal\r\n  particles at the corners; and that of a uniform solid tetrahedron\r\n  coincides with that of four equal particles at the vertices. Again,\r\n  the mass-centre of a uniform solid right circular cone divides the\r\n  axis in the ratio 3 : 1; that of a uniform solid hemisphere divides\r\n  the axial radius in the ratio 3 : 5.\r\n\r\n  It is easily seen from (6) that if the configuration of a system of\r\n  particles be altered by \"homogeneous strain\" (see ELASTICITY) the new\r\n  position of the mass-centre will be at that point of the strained\r\n  figure which corresponds to the original mass-centre.\r\n\r\nThe formula (2) shows that a system of concurrent forces represented by\r\nm1·[->OP1], m2·[->OP2], ... m_n·[->OP_n] will have a resultant\r\nrepresented hy [Sigma](m)·[->OG]. If we imagine O to recede to infinity\r\nin any direction we learn that a system of parallel forces proportional\r\nto m1, m2,... m_n, acting at P1, P2 ... P_n have a resultant\r\nproportional to [Sigma](m) which acts always through a point G fixed\r\nrelatively to the given mass-system. This contains the theory of the\r\n\"centre of gravity\" (§§ 4, 9). We may note also that if P1, P2, ... P_n,\r\nand P1´, P2´, ... P_n´ represent two configurations of the series of\r\nparticles, then\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](m·[->PP´]) = Sigma(m)·[->GG´],  (8)\r\n\r\nwhere G, G´ are the two positions of the mass-centre. The forces\r\nm1·[->P1P1´], m2·[->P2P2´], ... m_n·[->P_nP_n´], considered as localized\r\nvectors, do not, however, as a rule reduce to a single resultant.\r\n\r\nWe proceed to the theory of the _plane_, _axial_ and _polar quadratic\r\nmoments_ of the system. The axial moments have alone a dynamical\r\nsignificance, but the others are useful as subsidiary conceptions. If\r\nh1, h2, ... h_n be the perpendicular distances of the particles from any\r\nfixed plane, the sum [Sigma](mh²) is the quadratic moment with respect\r\nto the plane. If p1, p2, ... p_n be the perpendicular distances from any\r\ngiven axis, the sum [Sigma](mp²) is the quadratic moment with respect to\r\nthe axis; it is also called the _moment of inertia_ about the axis. If\r\nr1, r2, ... r_n be the distances from a fixed point, the sum\r\n[Sigma](mr²) is the quadratic moment with respect to that point (or\r\npole). If we divide any of the above quadratic moments by the total\r\nmass [Sigma](m), the result is called the _mean square_ of the distances\r\nof the particles from the respective plane, axis or pole. In the case of\r\nan axial moment, the square root of the resulting mean square is called\r\nthe _radius of gyration_ of the system about the axis in question. If we\r\ntake rectangular axes through any point O, the quadratic moments with\r\nrespect to the co-ordinate planes are\r\n\r\n  I_x = [Sigma](mx²), I_y = [Sigma](my²), I_z = [Sigma](mz²);  (9)\r\n\r\nthose with respect to the co-ordinate axes are\r\n\r\n  I_yz = [Sigma]{m(y² + z²)}, I_zx = [Sigma]{m(z² + x²)},\r\n  I_xy = [Sigma]{m(x² + y²)};  (10)\r\n\r\nwhilst the polar quadratic moment with respect to O is\r\n\r\n  I0 = [Sigma]{m(x² + y² + z²)}.  (11)\r\n\r\nWe note that\r\n\r\n  I_yz = I_y + I_z, I_zx = I_z + I_x, I_xy = I_x + I_y,  (12)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n  I0 = I_x + I_y + I_z = ½(I_yz + I_zx + I_xy).  (13)\r\n\r\n  In the case of continuous distributions of matter the summations in\r\n  (9), (10), (11) are of course to be replaced by integrations. For a\r\n  uniform thin circular plate, we find, taking the origin at its centre,\r\n  and the axis of z normal to its plane, I0 = ½Ma², where M is the mass\r\n  and a the radius. Since I_x = I_y, I_z = 0, we deduce I_zx = ½Ma²,\r\n  I_xy = ½Ma²; hence the value of the squared radius of gyration is for\r\n  a diameter ¼a², and for the axis of symmetry ½a². Again, for a uniform\r\n  solid sphere having its centre at the origin we find I0 = (3/5)Ma²,\r\n  I_x = I_y = I_z = (1/5)Ma², I_yz = I_zx = l_xy = (3/5)Ma²; i.e. the\r\n  square of the radius of gyration with respect to a diameter is\r\n  (2/5)a². The method of homogeneous strain can be applied to deduce the\r\n  corresponding results for an ellipsoid of semi-axes a, b, c. If the\r\n  co-ordinate axes coincide with the principal axes, we find I_x =\r\n  (1/5)Ma², I_y = (1/5)Mb², I_z = (1/5)Mc², whence I_yz = (1/5)M (b² +\r\n  c²), &c.\r\n\r\nIf [phi](x, y, z) be any homogeneous quadratic function of x, y, z, we\r\nhave\r\n\r\n  [Sigma]{m[phi](x, y, z)} = [Sigma] {m[phi]([|x] + [xi], [|y] + [eta], [|z] + [zeta])}\r\n    = [Sigma] {m[phi](x, y, z)} + [Sigma]{m[phi]([xi], [eta], [zeta])},  (14)\r\n\r\nsince the terms which are bilinear in respect to [|x], [|y], [|z], and\r\n[xi], [eta], [zeta] vanish, in virtue of the relations (7). Thus\r\n\r\n  I_x = I[xi] + [Sigma](m)x²,  (15)\r\n\r\n  I_yz = I[eta][zeta] + [Sigma](m)·(y² + z²),  (16)\r\n\r\nwith similar relations, and\r\n\r\n  I_O = I_G + [Sigma](m)·OG².  (17)\r\n\r\nThe formula (16) expresses that the squared radius of gyration about any\r\naxis (Ox) exceeds the squared radius of gyration about a parallel axis\r\nthrough G by the square of the distance between the two axes. The\r\nformula (17) is due to J. L. Lagrange; it may be written\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](m·OP²)   [Sigma](m·GP²)\r\n  -------------- = -------------- + OG²,  (18)\r\n    [Sigma](m)       [Sigma](m)\r\n\r\nand expresses that the mean square of the distances of the particles\r\nfrom O exceeds the mean square of the distances from G by OG². The\r\nmass-centre is accordingly that point the mean square of whose distances\r\nfrom the several particles is least. If in (18) we make O coincide with\r\nP1, P2, ... P_n in succession, we obtain\r\n\r\n  0 + m2·P1P2² + ... + mn·P1P_n² = [Sigma](m·GP²) + [Sigma](m)·GP1²,   \\\r\n  m1·P2P1² + 0 + ... + mn·P2P_n² = [Sigma](m·GP²) + [Sigma](m)·GP2²,    >  (19)\r\n         ...         ...          ...            ...         ...        |\r\n  m1·P_nP1² + m2·P_nP2² + ... + 0 = [Sigma](m·GP²) + [Sigma](m)·GP_n². /\r\n\r\nIf we multiply these equations by m1, m2 ... m_n, respectively, and add,\r\nwe find\r\n\r\n  [Sigma][Sigma](m_r m_s·P_r P_s²) = [Sigma](m)·[Sigma](m·GP²),  (20)\r\n\r\nprovided the summation [Sigma][Sigma] on the left hand be understood to\r\ninclude each pair of particles once only. This theorem, also due to\r\nLagrange, enables us to express the mean square of the distances of the\r\nparticles from the centre of mass in terms of the masses and mutual\r\ndistances. For instance, considering four equal particles at the\r\nvertices of a regular tetrahedron, we can infer that the radius R of the\r\ncircumscribing sphere is given by R² = (3/8)a², if a be the length of an\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nAnother type of quadratic moment is supplied by the _deviation-moments_,\r\nor _products of inertia_ of a distribution of matter. Thus the sum\r\n[Sigma](m·yz) is called the \"product of inertia\" with respect to the\r\nplanes y = 0, z = 0. This may be expressed In terms of the product of\r\ninertia with respect to parallel planes through G by means of the\r\nformula (14); viz.:--\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](m·yz) = [Sigma](m·[eta][zeta]) + [Sigma](m)·yz  (21)\r\n\r\nThe quadratic moments with respect to different planes through a fixed\r\npoint O are related to one another as follows. The moment with respect\r\nto the plane\r\n\r\n  [lambda]x + [mu]y + [nu]z = 0,  (22)\r\n\r\nwhere [lambda], [mu], [nu] are direction-cosines, is\r\n\r\n  [Sigma]{(m([lambda]x + [mu]y + [nu]z)²} = [Sigma](mx²)·[lambda]² + [Sigma](my²)·[mu]² + [Sigma](mz²)·[nu]²\r\n    + 2[Sigma](myz)·[mu][nu] + 2[Sigma](mzx)·[nu][lambda] + 2[Sigma](mxy)·[lambda][mu],  (23)\r\n\r\nand therefore varies as the square of the perpendicular drawn from O to\r\na tangent plane of a certain quadric surface, the tangent plane in\r\nquestion being parallel to (22). If the co-ordinate axes coincide with\r\nthe principal axes of this quadric, we shall have\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](myz) = 0, [Sigma](mzx) = 0, [Sigma](mxy) = 0;  (24)\r\n\r\nand if we write\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](mx²) = Ma², [Sigma](my²) = Mb², [Sigma](mz²) = Mc²,  (25)\r\n\r\nwhere M = [Sigma](m), the quadratic moment becomes M(a²[lambda]² +\r\nb²[mu]² + c²[nu]²), or Mp², where p is the distance of the origin from\r\nthat tangent plane of the ellipsoid\r\n\r\n   x²    y²    z²\r\n  --- + --- + --- = 1,  (26)\r\n   a²    b²    c²\r\n\r\nwhich is parallel to (22). It appears from (24) that through any\r\nassigned point O three rectangular axes can be drawn such that the\r\nproduct of inertia with respect to each pair of co-ordinate planes\r\nvanishes; these are called the _principal axes of inertia_ at O. The\r\nellipsoid (26) was first employed by J. Binet (1811), and may be called\r\n\"Binet's Ellipsoid\" for the point O. Evidently the quadratic moment for\r\na variable plane through O will have a \"stationary\" value when, and only\r\nwhen, the plane coincides with a principal plane of (26). It may further\r\nbe shown that if Binet's ellipsoid be referred to any system of\r\nconjugate diameters as co-ordinate axes, its equation will be\r\n\r\n  x´²   y´²   z´²\r\n  --- + --- + --- = 1,  (27)\r\n  a´²   b´²   c´²\r\n\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](mx´²) = Ma´², [Sigma](my´²) Mb´², [Sigma](mz´²) = Mc´²;\r\n\r\nalso that\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](my´z´) = 0, [Sigma](mz´x´) = 0, [Sigma](mx´y´) = 0.  (28)\r\n\r\nLet us now take as co-ordinate axes the principal axes of inertia at the\r\nmass-centre G. If a, b, c be the semi-axes of the Binet's ellipsoid of\r\nG, the quadratic moment with respect to the plane [lambda]x + [mu]y +\r\n[nu]z = 0 will be M(a²[lambda]² + b²[mu]² + c²[nu]²), and that with\r\nrespect to a parallel plane\r\n\r\n  [lambda]x + [mu]y + [nu]z = p  (29)\r\n\r\nwill be M(a²[lambda]² + b²[mu]² + c²[nu]² + p²), by (15). This will have\r\na given value Mk², provided\r\n\r\n  p² = (k² - a²)[lambda]² + (k² - b²)[mu]² + (k² - c²)[nu]².  (30)\r\n\r\nHence the planes of constant quadratic moment Mk² will envelop the\r\nquadric\r\n\r\n     x²        y²         z²\r\n  ------- + ------- +  ------- = 1,  (31)\r\n  k² - a²   k² - b²    k² - c²\r\n\r\nand the quadrics corresponding to different values of k² will be\r\nconfocal. If we write\r\n\r\n  k² = a² + b² + c² + [theta],\r\n  b² + c² = [alpha]², c² + a² = [beta]², a² + b² = [gamma]²  (32)\r\n\r\nthe equation (31) becomes\r\n\r\n          x²                  y²                   z²\r\n  ------------------ + ----------------- + ------------------ = 1  (33)\r\n  [alpha]² + [theta]   [beta]² + [theta]   [gamma]² + [theta]\r\n\r\nfor different values of [theta] this represents a system of quadrics\r\nconfocal with the ellipsoid\r\n\r\n     x²         y²        z²\r\n  -------- + ------- + -------- = 1,  (34)\r\n  [alpha]²   [beta]²   [gamma]²\r\n\r\nwhich we shall meet with presently as the \"ellipsoid of gyration\" at G.\r\nNow consider the tangent plane [omega] at any point P of a confocal, the\r\ntangent plane [omega]´ at an adjacent point N´, and a plane [omega]´´\r\nthrough P parallel to [omega]´. The distance between the planes [omega]´\r\nand [omega]´´ will be of the second order of small quantities, and the\r\nquadratic moments with respect to [omega]´ and [omega]´´ will therefore\r\nbe equal, to the first order. Since the quadratic moments with respect\r\nto [omega] and [omega]´ are equal, it follows that [omega] is a plane of\r\nstationary quadratic moment at P, and therefore a principal plane of\r\ninertia at P. In other words, the principal axes of inertia at P arc the\r\nnormals to the three confocals of the system (33) which pass through P.\r\nMoreover if x, y, z be the co-ordinates of P, (33) is an equation to\r\nfind the corresponding values of [theta]; and if [theta]1, [theta]2,\r\n[theta]3 be the roots we find\r\n\r\n  [theta]1 + [theta]2 + [theta]3 = r² - [alpha]² - [beta]² -[gamma]²,  (35)\r\n\r\nwhere r² = x² + y² + z². The squares of the radii of gyration about the\r\nprincipal axes at P may be denoted by k2² + k3², k3² + k1², k1² + k2²;\r\nhence by (32) and (35) they are r² - [theta]1, r² - [theta]2, r² -\r\n[theta]3, respectively.\r\n\r\nTo find the relations between the moments of inertia about different\r\naxes through any assigned point O, we take O as origin. Since the square\r\nof the distance of a point (x, y, z) from the axis\r\n\r\n     x         y     z\r\n  -------- = ---- = ----  (36)\r\n  [lambda]   [mu]   [nu]\r\n\r\nis x² + y² + z² - ([lambda]x + [mu]y + [nu]z)², the moment of inertia\r\nabout this axis is\r\n\r\n  I = [Sigma][m{([lambda]² + [mu]² + [nu]²)(x² + y² + z²) - ([lambda]x + [mu]y + [nu]z)²}]\r\n    = A[lambda]² + B[mu]² + C[nu]² - 2F[mu][nu] - 2G[nu][lambda] - 2H[lambda][mu],  (37)\r\n\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n  A = [Sigma]{m(y² + z²)}, B = [Sigma]{m(z² + x²)}, C = [Sigma]{m(x² + y²)},\r\n  F = [Sigma](myz), G = [Sigma](mzx), H = [Sigma](mxy);  (38)\r\n\r\ni.e. A, B, C are the moments of inertia about the co-ordinate axes, and\r\nF, G, H are the products of inertia with respect to the pairs of\r\nco-ordinate planes. If we construct the quadric\r\n\r\n  Ax² + By² + Cz² - 2Fyz - 2Gzx - 2Hxy = M[epsilon]^4  (39)\r\n\r\nwhere [epsilon] is an arbitrary linear magnitude, the intercept r which\r\nit makes on a radius drawn in the direction [lambda], [mu], [nu] is\r\nfound by putting x, y, z = [lambda]r, [mu]r, [nu]r. Hence, by comparison\r\nwith (37),\r\n\r\n  I = M[epsilon]^4/r².  (40)\r\n\r\nThe moment of inertia about any radius of the quadric (39) therefore\r\nvaries inversely as the square of the length of this radius. When\r\nreferred to its principal axes, the equation of the quadric takes the\r\nform\r\n\r\n  Ax² + By² + Cz² = M[epsilon]^4.  (41)\r\n\r\nThe directions of these axes are determined by the property (24), and\r\ntherefore coincide with those of the principal axes of inertia at O, as\r\nalready defined in connexion with the theory of plane quadratic moments.\r\nThe new A, B, C are called the _principal moments of inertia_ at O.\r\nSince they are essentially positive the quadric is an ellipsoid; it is\r\ncalled the _momental ellipsoid_ at O. Since, by (12), B + C > A, &c.,\r\nthe sum of the two lesser principal moments must exceed the greatest\r\nprincipal moment. A limitation is thus imposed on the possible forms of\r\nthe momental ellipsoid; e.g. in the case of symmetry about an axis it\r\nappears that the ratio of the polar to the equatorial diameter of the\r\nellipsoid cannot be less than 1/[root]2.\r\n\r\nIf we write A = M[alpha]², B = M[beta]², C = M[gamma]², the formula\r\n(37), when referred to the principal axes at O, becomes\r\n\r\n  I = M([alpha]²[lambda]² + [beta]²[mu]² + [gamma]²[nu]²) = Mp²,  (42)\r\n\r\nif p denotes the perpendicular drawn from O in the direction ([lambda],\r\n[mu], [nu]) to a tangent plane of the ellipsoid\r\n\r\n     x²         y²        z²\r\n  -------- + ------- + -------- = 1  (43)\r\n  [alpha]²   [beta]²   [gamma]²\r\n\r\nThis is called the _ellipsoid of gyration_ at O; it was introduced into\r\nthe theory by J. MacCullagh. The ellipsoids (41) and (43) are reciprocal\r\npolars with respect to a sphere having O as centre.\r\n\r\nIf A = B = C, the momental ellipsoid becomes a sphere; all axes through\r\nO are then principal axes, and the moment of inertia is the same for\r\neach. The mass-system is then said to possess kinetic symmetry about O.\r\n\r\n  If all the masses lie in a plane (z = 0) we have, in the notation of\r\n  (25), c² = 0, and therefore A = Mb², B = Ma², C = M(a² + b²), so that\r\n  the equation of the momental ellipsoid takes the form\r\n\r\n    b²x² + a²y² + (a² + b²)z² = [epsilon]^4.  (44)\r\n\r\n  The section of this by the plane z = 0 is similar to\r\n\r\n     x²     y²\r\n    ---- + ---- = 1,  (45)\r\n     a²     b²\r\n\r\n  which may be called the _momental ellipse_ at O. It possesses the\r\n  property that the radius of gyration about any diameter is half the\r\n  distance between the two tangents which are parallel to that diameter.\r\n  In the case of a uniform triangular plate it may be shown that the\r\n  momental ellipse at G is concentric, similar and similarly situated\r\n\r\n  to the ellipse which touches the sides of the triangle at their middle\r\n  points.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 59.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 60.]\r\n\r\n  The graphical methods of determining the moment of inertia of a plane\r\n  system of particles with respect to any line in its plane may be\r\n  briefly noticed. It appears from § 5 (fig. 31) that the linear moment\r\n  of each particle about the line may be found by means of a funicular\r\n  polygon. If we replace the mass of each particle by its moment, as\r\n  thus found, we can in like manner obtain the quadratic moment of the\r\n  system with respect to the line. For if the line in question be the\r\n  axis of y, the first process gives us the values of mx, and the second\r\n  the value of [Sigma](mx·x) or [Sigma](mx²). The construction of a\r\n  second funicular may be dispensed with by the employment of a\r\n  planimeter, as follows. In fig. 59 p is the line with respect to which\r\n  moments are to be taken, and the masses of the respective particles\r\n  are indicated by the corresponding segments of a line in the\r\n  force-diagram, drawn parallel to p. The funicular ZABCD ...\r\n  corresponding to any pole O is constructed for a system of forces\r\n  acting parallel to p through the positions of the particles and\r\n  proportional to the respective masses; and its successive sides are\r\n  produced to meet p in the points H, K, L, M, ... As explained in § 5,\r\n  the moment of the first particle is represented on a certain scale by\r\n  HK, that of the second by KL, and so on. The quadratic moment of the\r\n  first particle will then be represented by twice the area AHK, that of\r\n  the second by twice the area BKL, and so on. The quadratic moment of\r\n  the whole system is therefore represented by twice the area AHEDCBA.\r\n  Since a quadratic moment is essentially positive, the various areas\r\n  are to taken positive in all cases. If k be the radius of gyration\r\n  about p we find\r\n\r\n    k² = 2 × area AHEDCBA × ON ÷ [alpha][beta],\r\n\r\n  where [alpha][beta] is the line in the force-diagram which represents\r\n  the sum of the masses, and ON is the distance of the pole O from this\r\n  line. If some of the particles lie on one side of p and some on the\r\n  other, the quadratic moment of each set may be found, and the results\r\n  added. This is illustrated in fig. 60, where the total quadratic\r\n  moment is represented by the sum of the shaded areas. It is seen that\r\n  for a given direction of p this moment is least when p passes through\r\n  the intersection X of the first and last sides of the funicular; i.e.\r\n  when p goes through the mass-centre of the given system; cf. equation\r\n  (15).\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.--KINETICS\r\n\r\n§ 12. _Rectilinear Motion._--Let x denote the distance OP of a moving\r\npoint P at time t from a fixed origin O on the line of motion, this\r\ndistance being reckoned positive or negative according as it lies to one\r\nside or the other of O. At time t + [delta]t let the point be at Q, and\r\nlet OQ = x + [delta]x. The _mean velocity_ of the point in the interval\r\n[delta]t is [delta]x/[delta]t. The limiting value of this when [delta]t\r\nis infinitely small, viz. dx/dt, is adopted as the definition of the\r\n_velocity_ at the instant t. Again, let u be the velocity at time t, u +\r\n[delta]u that at time t + [delta]t. The mean rate of increase of\r\nvelocity, or the _mean acceleration_, in the interval [delta]t is then\r\n[delta]u/[delta]t. The limiting value of this when [delta]t is\r\ninfinitely small, viz., du/dt, is adopted as the definition of the\r\n_acceleration_ at the instant t. Since u = dx/dt, the acceleration is\r\nalso denoted by d²x/dt². It is often convenient to use the \"fluxional\"\r\nnotation for differential coefficients with respect to time; thus the\r\nvelocity may be represented by [.x] and the acceleration by [.u] or\r\n[:x]. There is another formula for the acceleration, in which u is\r\nregarded as a function of the position; thus du/dt = (du/dx)(dx/dt) =\r\nu(du/dx). The relation between x and t in any particular case may be\r\nillustrated by means of a curve constructed with t as abscissa and x as\r\nordinate. This is called the _curve of positions_ or _space-time curve_;\r\nits gradient represents the velocity. Such curves are often traced\r\nmechanically in acoustical and other experiments. A, curve with t as\r\nabscissa and u as ordinate is called the _curve of velocities_ or\r\n_velocity-time curve_. Its gradient represents the acceleration, and the\r\narea ([int]udt) included between any two ordinates represents the space\r\ndescribed in the interval between the corresponding instants (see fig.\r\n62).\r\n\r\nSo far nothing has been said about the measurement of time. From the\r\npurely kinematic point of view, the t of our formulae may be any\r\ncontinuous independent variable, suggested (it may be) by some physical\r\nprocess. But from the dynamical standpoint it is obvious that equations\r\nwhich represent the facts correctly on one system of time-measurement\r\nmight become seriously defective on another. It is found that for almost\r\nall purposes a system of measurement based ultimately on the earth's\r\nrotation is perfectly adequate. It is only when we come to consider such\r\ndelicate questions as the influence of tidal friction that other\r\nstandards become necessary.\r\n\r\nThe most important conception in kinetics is that of \"inertia.\" It is a\r\nmatter of ordinary observation that different bodies acted on by the\r\nsame force, or what is judged to be the same force, undergo different\r\nchanges of velocity in equal times. In our ideal representation of\r\nnatural phenomena this is allowed for by endowing each material particle\r\nwith a suitable _mass_ or _inertia-coefficient_ m. The product _mu_ of\r\nthe mass into the velocity is called the _momentum_ or (in Newton's\r\nphrase) the _quantity of motion_. On the Newtonian system the motion of\r\na particle entirely uninfluenced by other bodies, when referred to a\r\nsuitable base, would be rectilinear, with constant velocity. If the\r\nvelocity changes, this is attributed to the action of force; and if we\r\nagree to measure the force (X) by the rate of change of momentum which\r\nit produces, we have the equation\r\n\r\n   d\r\n  --- (mu) = X.  (1)\r\n  dt\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view the equation is a mere truism, its real\r\nimportance resting on the fact that by attributing suitable values to\r\nthe masses m, and by making simple assumptions as to the value of X in\r\neach case, we are able to frame adequate representations of whole\r\nclasses of phenomena as they actually occur. The question remains, of\r\ncourse, as to how far the measurement of force here implied is\r\npractically consistent with the gravitational method usually adopted in\r\nstatics; this will be referred to presently.\r\n\r\nThe practical unit or standard of mass must, from the nature of the\r\ncase, be the mass of some particular body, e.g. the imperial pound, or\r\nthe kilogramme. In the \"C.G.S.\" system a subdivision of the latter, viz.\r\nthe gramme, is adopted, and is associated with the centimetre as the\r\nunit of length, and the mean solar second as the unit of time. The unit\r\nof force implied in (1) is that which produces unit momentum in unit\r\ntime. On the C.G.S. system it is that force which acting on one gramme\r\nfor one second produces a velocity of one centimetre per second; this\r\nunit is known as the _dyne_. Units of this kind are called _absolute_ on\r\naccount of their fundamental and invariable character as contrasted with\r\ngravitational units, which (as we shall see presently) vary somewhat\r\nwith the locality at which the measurements are supposed to be made.\r\n\r\nIf we integrate the equation (1) with respect to t between the limits t,\r\nt´ we obtain\r\n               _\r\n              / t´\r\n  mu´- mu =   |   X dt.  (2)\r\n             _/ t\r\n\r\nThe time-integral on the right hand is called the _impulse_ of the force\r\non the interval t´ - t. The statement that the increase of momentum is\r\nequal to the impulse is (it maybe remarked) equivalent to Newton's own\r\nformulation of his Second Law. The form (1) is deduced from it by\r\nputting t´- t = [delta]t, and taking [delta]t to be infinitely small. In\r\nproblems of impact we have to deal with cases of practically\r\ninstantaneous impulse, where a very great and rapidly varying force\r\nproduces an appreciable change of momentum in an exceedingly minute\r\ninterval of time.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a constant force, the acceleration [.u] or [:x] is,\r\naccording to (1), constant, and we have\r\n\r\n  d²x\r\n  --- = [alpha],  (3)\r\n  dt²\r\n\r\nsay, the general solution of which is\r\n\r\n  x = ½[alpha]t² + At + B.  (4)\r\n\r\nThe \"arbitrary constants\" A, B enable us to represent the circumstances\r\nof any particular case; thus if the velocity [.x] and the position x be\r\ngiven for any one value of t, we have two conditions to determine A, B.\r\nThe curve of positions corresponding to (4) is a parabola, and that of\r\nvelocities is a straight line. We may take it as an experimental result,\r\nalthough the best evidence is indirect, that a particle falling freely\r\nunder gravity experiences a constant acceleration which at the same\r\nplace is the same for all bodies. This acceleration is denoted by g; its\r\nvalue at Greenwich is about 981 centimetre-second units, or 32.2 feet\r\nper second. It increases somewhat with the latitude, the extreme\r\nvariation from the equator to the pole being about ½%. We infer that on\r\nour reckoning the force of gravity on a mass m is to be measured by mg,\r\nthe momentum produced per second when this force acts alone. Since this\r\nis proportional to the mass, the relative masses to be attributed to\r\nvarious bodies can be determined practically by means of the balance. We\r\nlearn also that on account of the variation of g with the locality a\r\ngravitational system of force-measurement is inapplicable when more than\r\na moderate degree of accuracy is desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.]\r\n\r\nWe take next the case of a particle attracted towards a fixed point O in\r\nthe line of motion with a force varying as the distance from that point.\r\nIf [mu] be the acceleration at unit distance, the equation of motion\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n  d²x\r\n  --- = -[mu]x,  (5)\r\n  dt²\r\n\r\nthe solution of which may be written in either of the forms\r\n\r\n  x = A cos [sigma]t + B sin [sigma]t,  x = a cos ([sigma]t + [epsilon]),  (6)\r\n\r\nwhere [sigma]= [root][mu], and the two constants A, B or a, [epsilon]\r\nare arbitrary. The particle oscillates between the two positions x = ±a,\r\nand the same point is passed through in the same direction with the same\r\nvelocity at equal intervals of time 2[pi]/[sigma]. The type of motion\r\nrepresented by (6) is of fundamental importance in the theory of\r\nvibrations (§ 23); it is called a _simple-harmonic_ or (shortly) a\r\n_simple_ vibration. If we imagine a point Q to describe a circle of\r\nradius a with the angular velocity [sigma], its orthogonal projection P\r\non a fixed diameter AA´ will execute a vibration of this character. The\r\nangle [sigma]t + [epsilon] (or AOQ) is called the _phase_; the arbitrary\r\nelements a, [epsilon] are called the _amplitude_ and _epoch_ (or initial\r\nphase), respectively. In the case of very rapid vibrations it is usual\r\nto specify, not the _period_ (2[pi]/[sigma]), but its reciprocal the\r\n_frequency_, i.e. the number of complete vibrations per unit time. Fig.\r\n62 shows the curves of position and velocity; they both have the form of\r\nthe \"curve of sines.\" The numbers correspond to an amplitude of 10\r\ncentimetres and a period of two seconds.\r\n\r\nThe vertical oscillations of a weight which hangs from a fixed point by\r\na spiral spring come under this case. If M be the mass, and x the\r\nvertical displacement from the position of equilibrium, the equation of\r\nmotion is of the form\r\n\r\n    d²x\r\n  M --- = - Kx,  (7)\r\n    dt²\r\n\r\nprovided the inertia of the spring itself be neglected. This becomes\r\nidentical with (5) if we put [mu] = K/M; and the period is therefore\r\n2[pi][root](M/K), the same for all amplitudes. The period is increased\r\nby an increase of the mass M, and diminished by an increase in the\r\nstiffness (K) of the spring. If c be the statical increase of length\r\nwhich is produced by the gravity of the mass M, we have Kc = Mg, and the\r\nperiod is 2[pi][root](c/g).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.]\r\n\r\nThe small oscillations of a simple pendulum in a vertical plane also\r\ncome under equation (5). According to the principles of § 13, the\r\nhorizontal motion of the bob is affected only by the horizontal\r\ncomponent of the force acting upon it. If the inclination of the string\r\nto the vertical does not exceed a few degrees, the vertical displacement\r\nof the particle is of the second order, so that the vertical\r\nacceleration may be neglected, and the tension of the string may be\r\nequated to the gravity mg of the particle. Hence if l be the length of\r\nthe string, and x the horizontal displacement of the bob from the\r\nequilibrium position, the horizontal component of gravity is mgx/l,\r\nwhence\r\n\r\n  d²x     gx\r\n  --- = - ---,  (8)\r\n  dt²      l\r\n\r\nThe motion is therefore simple-harmonic, of period [tau] =\r\n2[pi][root](l/g). This indicates an experimental method of determining g\r\nwith considerable accuracy, using the formula g = 4[pi]²l/[tau]².\r\n\r\n  In the case of a repulsive force varying as the distance from the\r\n  origin, the equation of motion is of the type\r\n\r\n    d²x\r\n    --- = [mu]x,  (9)\r\n    dt²\r\n\r\n  the solution of which is\r\n\r\n    x = A e^(nt) + B e^(-nt),  (10)\r\n\r\n  where n = [root][mu]. Unless the initial conditions be adjusted so as\r\n  to make A = 0 exactly, x will ultimately increase indefinitely with t.\r\n  The position x = 0 is one of equilibrium, but it is unstable. This\r\n  applies to the inverted pendulum, with [mu] = g/l, but the equation\r\n  (9) is then only approximate, and the solution therefore only serves\r\n  to represent the initial stages of a motion in the neighbourhood of\r\n  the position of unstable equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIn acoustics we meet with the case where a body is urged towards a fixed\r\npoint by a force varying as the distance, and is also acted upon by an\r\n\"extraneous\" or \"disturbing\" force which is a given function of the\r\ntime. The most important case is where this function is simple-harmonic,\r\nso that the equation (5) is replaced by\r\n\r\n  d²x\r\n  --- + [mu]x = f cos ([sigma]1t + [alpha]),  (11)\r\n  dt²\r\n\r\nwhere [sigma]1 is prescribed. A particular solution is\r\n\r\n             f\r\n  x = ---------------- cos ([sigma]1t + [alpha]).  (12)\r\n      [mu] - [sigma]1²\r\n\r\nThis represents a _forced oscillation_ whose period 2[pi]/[sigma]1,\r\ncoincides with that of the disturbing force; and the phase agrees with\r\nthat of the force, or is opposed to it, according as [sigma]1² < or > [mu];\r\ni.e. according as the imposed period is greater or less than the natural\r\nperiod 2[pi]/[root][mu]. The solution fails when the two periods agree\r\nexactly; the formula (12) is then replaced by\r\n\r\n           ft\r\n  x  = ---------- sin ([sigma]1t + [alpha]),  (13)\r\n       2 [sigma]1\r\n\r\nwhich represents a vibration of continually increasing amplitude. Since\r\nthe equation (12) is in practice generally only an approximation (as in\r\nthe case of the pendulum), this solution can only be accepted as a\r\nrepresentation of the initial stages of the forced oscillation. To\r\nobtain the complete solution of (11) we must of course superpose the\r\nfree vibration (6) with its arbitrary constants in order to obtain a\r\ncomplete representation of the most general motion consequent on\r\narbitrary initial conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.]\r\n\r\n  A simple mechanical illustration is afforded by the pendulum. If the\r\n  point of suspension have an imposed simple vibration [xi] = a cos\r\n  [sigma]t in a horizontal line, the equation of small motion of the bob\r\n  is\r\n\r\n                x - [xi]\r\n    m[:x] = -mg --------,\r\n                   l\r\n\r\n  or\r\n\r\n           gx    [xi]\r\n    [:x] + --- = ----.  (14)\r\n            l      l\r\n\r\n  This is the same as if the point of suspension were fixed, and a\r\n  horizontal disturbing force mg[xi]/l were to act on the bob. The\r\n  difference of phase of the forced vibration in the two cases is\r\n  illustrated and explained in the annexed fig. 63, where the pendulum\r\n  virtually oscillates about C as a fixed point of suspension. This\r\n  illustration was given by T. Young in connexion with the kinetic\r\n  theory of the tides, where the same point arises.\r\n\r\n  We may notice also the case of an attractive force varying inversely\r\n  as the square of the distance from the origin. If [mu] be the\r\n  acceleration at unit distance, we have\r\n\r\n      du      [mu]\r\n    u --- = - ----  (15)\r\n      dx       x²\r\n\r\n  whence\r\n\r\n         2[mu]\r\n    u² = ----- + C.  (16)\r\n           x\r\n\r\n  In the case of a particle falling directly towards the earth from rest\r\n  at a very great distance we have C = 0 and, by Newton's Law of\r\n  Gravitation, [mu]/a² = g, where a is the earth's radius. The deviation\r\n  of the earth's figure from sphericity, and the variation of g with\r\n  latitude, are here ignored. We find that the velocity with which the\r\n  particle would arrive at the earth's surface (x = a) is [root](2ga).\r\n  If we take as rough values a = 21 × 10^6 feet, g = 32 foot-second\r\n  units, we get a velocity of 36,500 feet, or about seven miles, per\r\n  second. If the particles start from rest at a finite distance c, we\r\n  have in (16), C = - 2[mu]/c, and therefore\r\n\r\n    dx             / / 2[mu](c - x) \\\r\n    --  = u = -   / (  ------------- ),  (17)\r\n    dt          \\/   \\     cx       /\r\n\r\n  the minus sign indicating motion towards the origin. If we put x = c\r\n  cos² ½[phi], we find\r\n\r\n           c^(3/2)\r\n    t = ------------- ([phi] + sin [phi]),  (18)\r\n        [root](8[mu])\r\n\r\n  no additive constant being necessary if t be reckoned from the instant\r\n  of starting, when [phi] = 0. The time t of reaching the origin ([phi]\r\n  = [pi]) is\r\n\r\n         [pi] c^(3/2)\r\n    t1 = -------------.  (19)\r\n         [root](8[mu])\r\n\r\n  This may be compared with the period of revolution in a circular orbit\r\n  of radius c about the same centre of force, viz.\r\n  2[pi]c^(3/2)/[root][mu](§ 14). We learn that if the orbital motion of\r\n  a planet, or a satellite, were arrested, the body would fall into the\r\n  sun, or into its primary, in the fraction 0.1768 of its actual\r\n  periodic time. Thus the moon would reach the earth in about five days.\r\n  It may be noticed that if the scales of x and t be properly adjusted,\r\n  the curve of positions in the present problem is the portion of a\r\n  cycloid extending from a vertex to a cusp.\r\n\r\nIn any case of rectilinear motion, if we integrate both sides of the\r\nequation\r\n\r\n     du\r\n  mu -- = X,  (20)\r\n     dx\r\n\r\nwhich is equivalent to (1), with respect to x between the limits x0, x1,\r\nwe obtain\r\n                     _\r\n                    / x1\r\n  ½ mu1² - ½ mu0² = |    X dx.  (21)\r\n                   _/ x0\r\n\r\nWe recognize the right-hand member as the _work_ done by the force X on\r\nthe particle as the latter moves from the position x0 to the position\r\nx1. If we construct a curve with x as abscissa and X as ordinate, this\r\nwork is represented, as in J. Watt's \"indicator-diagram,\" by the area\r\ncut off by the ordinates x = x0, x = x1. The product ½mu² is called the\r\n_kinetic energy_ of the particle, and the equation (21) is therefore\r\nequivalent to the statement that the increment of the kinetic energy is\r\nequal to the work done on the particle. If the force X be always the\r\nsame in the same position, the particle may be regarded as moving in a\r\ncertain invariable \"field of force.\" The work which would have to be\r\nsupplied by other forces, extraneous to the field, in order to bring the\r\nparticle from rest in some standard position P0 to rest in any assigned\r\nposition P, will depend only on the position of P; it is called the\r\n_statical_ or _potential energy_ of the particle with respect to the\r\nfield, in the position P. Denoting this by V, we have [delta]V -\r\nX[delta]x = 0, whence\r\n\r\n        dV\r\n  X = - --,  (22)\r\n        dx\r\n\r\nThe equation (21) may now be written\r\n\r\n  ½ mu1² + V1 = ½ mu0² + V0,  (23)\r\n\r\nwhich asserts that when no extraneous forces act the sum of the kinetic\r\nand potential energies is constant. Thus in the case of a weight hanging\r\nby a spiral spring the work required to increase the length by x is V =\r\n[int 0 to x] Kxdx = ½Kx², whence ½Mu² + ½Kx² = const., as is easily\r\nverified from preceding results. It is easily seen that the effect of\r\nextraneous forces will be to increase the sum of the kinetic and\r\npotential energies by an amount equal to the work done by them. If this\r\namount be negative the sum in question is diminished by a corresponding\r\namount. It appears then that this sum is a measure of the total capacity\r\nfor doing work against extraneous resistances which the particle\r\npossesses in virtue of its motion and its position; this is in fact the\r\norigin of the term \"energy.\" The product mv² had been called by G. W.\r\nLeibnitz the \"vis viva\"; the name \"energy\" was substituted by T. Young;\r\nfinally the name \"actual energy\" was appropriated to the expression ½mv²\r\nby W. J. M. Rankine.\r\n\r\n  The laws which regulate the resistance of a medium such as air to the\r\n  motion of bodies through it are only imperfectly known. We may briefly\r\n  notice the case of resistance varying as the square of the velocity,\r\n  which is mathematically simple. If the positive direction of x be\r\n  downwards, the equation of motion of a falling particle will be of the\r\n  form\r\n\r\n    du\r\n    -- = g - ku²;  (24)\r\n    dt\r\n\r\n  this shows that the velocity u will send asymptotically to a certain\r\n  limit V (called the _terminal velocity_) such that kV² = g. The\r\n  solution is\r\n\r\n               gt        V²           gt\r\n    u = V tanh ---,  x = --- log cosh ---,  (25)\r\n                V         g            V\r\n\r\n  if the particle start from rest in the position x = 0 at the instant t\r\n  = 0. In the case of a particle projected vertically upwards we have\r\n\r\n    du\r\n    -- = -g - ku²,  (26)\r\n    dt\r\n\r\n  the positive direction being now upwards. This leads to\r\n\r\n            u           u0     gt        V²      V² + u0²\r\n    tan^-1 --- = tan^-1 ---  - ---,  x = --- log --------,  (27)\r\n            V            V      V        2g      V² + u²\r\n\r\n  where u0 is the velocity of projection. The particle comes to rest\r\n  when\r\n\r\n         V         u0       V²       /    u0² \\\r\n    t = --- tan^-1 ---, x = --- log ( 1 + ---  ).  (28)\r\n         g          V       2g       \\    V²  /\r\n\r\n  For small velocities the resistance of the air is more nearly\r\n  proportional to the first power of the velocity. The effect of forces\r\n  of this type on small vibratory motions may be investigated as\r\n  follows. The equation (5) when modified by the introduction of a\r\n  frictional term becomes\r\n\r\n    [:x] = -[mu]x - k [.x].  (29)\r\n\r\n  If k² < 4[mu] the solution is\r\n\r\n    x = a e^{-t/[tau]} cos ([sigma]t + [epsilon]),  (30)\r\n\r\n  where\r\n\r\n    [tau] = 2/k,  [sigma] = [root]([mu] - ¼k²),  (31)\r\n\r\n  and the constants a, [epsilon] are arbitrary. This may be described as\r\n  a simple harmonic oscillation whose amplitude diminishes\r\n  asymptotically to zero according to the law e^(-t/[tau]). The constant\r\n  [tau] is called the _modulus of decay_ of the oscillations; if it is\r\n  large compared with 2[pi]/[sigma] the effect of friction on the period\r\n  is of the second order of small quantities and may in general be\r\n  ignored. We have seen that a true simple-harmonic vibration may be\r\n  regarded as the orthogonal projection of uniform circular motion; it\r\n  was pointed out by P. G. Tait that a similar representation of the\r\n  type (30) is obtained if we replace the circle by an equiangular\r\n  spiral described, with a constant angular velocity about the pole, in\r\n  the direction of diminishing radius vector. When k² > 4[mu], the\r\n  solution of (29) is, in real form,\r\n\r\n    x = a1 e^(-t/[tau]1) + a2 e^(-t/[tau]2),  (32)\r\n\r\n  where\r\n\r\n    1/[tau]1, 1/[tau]2 = ½k ± [root](¼k² - [mu]).  (33)\r\n\r\n  The body now passes once (at most) through its equilibrium position,\r\n  and the vibration is therefore styled _aperiodic_.\r\n\r\n  To find the forced oscillation due to a periodic force we have\r\n\r\n    [:x] + k[.x] + [mu]x = f cos ([sigma]1t + [epsilon]).  (34)\r\n\r\n  The solution is\r\n\r\n         f\r\n    x = --- cos ([sigma]1t + [epsilon] - [epsilon]1),   (35)\r\n         R\r\n\r\n  provided\r\n                                                                  k[sigma]1\r\n    R = {([mu] - [sigma]1²)² + k²[sigma]1²}^½, tan[epsilon]1 = ----------------.  (36)\r\n                                                               [mu] - [sigma]1²\r\n\r\n  Hence the phase of the vibration lags behind that of the force by the\r\n  amount [epsilon]1, which lies between 0 and ½[pi] or between ½[pi] and\r\n  [pi], according as [sigma]1² <> [mu]. If the friction be comparatively\r\n  slight the amplitude is greatest when the imposed period coincides\r\n  with the free period, being then equal to f/k[sigma]1, and therefore\r\n  very great compared with that due to a slowly varying force of the\r\n  same average intensity. We have here, in principle, the explanation of\r\n  the phenomenon of \"resonance\" in acoustics. The abnormal amplitude is\r\n  greater, and is restricted to a narrower range of frequency, the\r\n  smaller the friction. For a complete solution of (34) we must of\r\n  course superpose the free vibration (30); but owing to the factor\r\n  e^(-t/[tau]) the influence of the initial conditions gradually\r\n  disappears.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of mathematical treatment a force which produces a finite\r\nchange of velocity in a time too short to be appreciated is regarded as\r\ninfinitely great, and the time of action as infinitely short. The whole\r\neffect is summed up in the value of the instantaneous impulse, which is\r\nthe time-integral of the force. Thus if an instantaneous impulse [xi]\r\nchanges the velocity of a mass m from u to u´ we have\r\n\r\n  mu´- mu = [xi].  (37)\r\n\r\nThe effect of ordinary finite forces during the infinitely short\r\nduration of this impulse is of course ignored.\r\n\r\nWe may apply this to the theory of impact. If two masses m1, m2 moving\r\nin the same straight line impinge, with the result that the velocities\r\nare changed from u1, u2, to u1´, u2´, then, since the impulses on the\r\ntwo bodies must be equal and opposite, the total momentum is unchanged,\r\ni.e.\r\n\r\n  m1u1´ + m2u2´ = m1u1 + m2u2.  (38)\r\n\r\nThe complete determination of the result of a collision under given\r\ncircumstances is not a matter of abstract dynamics alone, but requires\r\nsome auxiliary assumption. If we assume that there is no loss of\r\napparent kinetic energy we have also\r\n\r\n  m1u1² + m2u2´² = m1u1² + m2u2².  (39)\r\n\r\nHence, and from (38),\r\n\r\n  u2´ - u1´ = -(u2 - u1),  (40)\r\n\r\ni.e. the relative velocity of the two bodies is reversed in direction,\r\nbut unaltered in magnitude. This appears to be the case very\r\napproximately with steel or glass balls; generally, however, there is\r\nsome appreciable loss of apparent energy; this is accounted for by\r\nvibrations produced in the balls and imperfect elasticity of the\r\nmaterials. The usual empirical assumption is that\r\n\r\n  u2´ - u1´ = -e(u2 - u1),  (41)\r\n\r\nwhere e is a proper fraction which is constant for the same two bodies.\r\nIt follows from the formula § 15 (10) for the internal kinetic energy of\r\na system of particles that as a result of the impact this energy is\r\ndiminished by the amount\r\n\r\n              m1m2\r\n  ½(1 - e²) ------- (u1 - u2)².  (42)\r\n            m1 + m2\r\n\r\nThe further theoretical discussion of the subject belongs to ELASTICITY.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most suitable place for a few remarks on the theory\r\nof \"dimensions.\" (See also UNITS, DIMENSIONS OF.) In any absolute system\r\nof dynamical measurement the fundamental units are those of mass, length\r\nand time; we may denote them by the symbols M, L, T, respectively. They\r\nmay be chosen quite arbitrarily, e.g. on the C.G.S. system they are the\r\ngramme, centimetre and second. All other units are derived from these.\r\nThus the unit of velocity is that of a point describing the unit of\r\nlength in the unit of time; it may be denoted by LT^-1, this symbol\r\nindicating that the magnitude of the unit in question varies directly as\r\nthe unit of length and inversely as the unit of time. The unit of\r\nacceleration is the acceleration of a point which gains unit velocity in\r\nunit time; it is accordingly denoted by LT^-2. The unit of momentum is\r\nMLT^-1; the unit force generates unit momentum in unit time and is\r\ntherefore denoted by MLT^-2. The unit of work on the same principles is\r\nML²T^-2, and it is to be noticed that this is identical with the unit of\r\nkinetic energy. Some of these derivative units have special names\r\nassigned to them; thus on the C.G.S. system the unit of force is called\r\nthe _dyne_, and the unit of work or energy the _erg_. The number which\r\nexpresses a physical quantity of any particular kind will of course vary\r\ninversely as the magnitude of the corresponding unit. In any general\r\ndynamical equation the dimensions of each term in the fundamental units\r\nmust be the same, for a change of units would otherwise alter the\r\nvarious terms in different ratios. This principle is often useful as a\r\ncheck on the accuracy of an equation.\r\n\r\n  The theory of dimensions often enables us to forecast, to some extent,\r\n  the manner in which the magnitudes involved in any particular problem\r\n  will enter into the result. Thus, assuming that the period of a small\r\n  oscillation of a given pendulum at a given place is a definite\r\n  quantity, we see that it must vary as [root](l/g). For it can only\r\n  depend on the mass m of the bob, the length l of the string, and the\r\n  value of g at the place in question; and the above expression is the\r\n  only combination of these symbols whose dimensions are those of a\r\n  time, simply. Again, the time of falling from a distance a into a\r\n  given centre of force varying inversely as the square of the distance\r\n  will depend only on a and on the constant [mu] of equation (15). The\r\n  dimensions of [mu]/x² are those of an acceleration; hence the\r\n  dimensions of [mu] are L³T^-2. Assuming that the time in question\r\n  varies as a^x[mu]^y, whose dimensions are L^(x + 3y)T^(-2y), we must\r\n  have x + 3y = 0, -2y = 1, so that the time of falling will vary as\r\n  a^(3/2)/[root][mu], in agreement with (19).\r\n\r\n  The argument appears in a more demonstrative form in the theory of\r\n  \"similar\" systems, or (more precisely) of the similar motion of\r\n  similar systems. Thus, considering the equations\r\n\r\n    d²x     [mu]  d²x´     [mu]´\r\n    --- = - ----, ---- = - -----,   (43)\r\n    dt²      x²   dt´²      x´²\r\n\r\n  which refer to two particles falling independently into two distinct\r\n  centres of force, it is obvious that it is possible to have x in a\r\n  constant ratio to x´, and t in a constant ratio to t´, provided that\r\n\r\n     x     x´   [mu]   [mu]´\r\n    --- : --- = ---- : -----,   (44)\r\n     t²   t´²    x²     x´²\r\n\r\n  and that there is a suitable correspondence between the initial\r\n  conditions. The relation (44) is equivalent to\r\n\r\n             x^(3/2)   x´^(3/2)\r\n    t : t´ = ------- : --------,  (45)\r\n             [mu]^½    [mu]´^½\r\n\r\n  where x, x´ are any two corresponding distances; e.g. they may be the\r\n  initial distances, both particles being supposed to start from rest.\r\n  The consideration of dimensions was introduced by J. B. Fourier (1822)\r\n  in connexion with the conduction of heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.]\r\n\r\n§ 13. _General Motion of a Particle._--Let P, Q be the positions of a\r\nmoving point at times t, t + [delta]t respectively. A vector [->OU]\r\ndrawn parallel to PQ, of length proportional to PQ/[delta]t on any\r\nconvenient scale, will represent the _mean velocity_ in the interval\r\n[delta]t, i.e. a point moving with a constant velocity having the\r\nmagnitude and direction indicated by this vector would experience the\r\nsame resultant displacement [->PQ] in the same time. As [delta]t is\r\nindefinitely diminished, the vector [->OU] will tend to a definite limit\r\n[->OV]; this is adopted as the definition of the _velocity_ of the\r\nmoving point at the instant t. Obviously [->OV] is parallel to the\r\ntangent to the path at P, and its magnitude is ds/dt, where s is the\r\narc. If we project [->OV] on the co-ordinate axes (rectangular or\r\noblique) in the usual manner, the projections u, v, w are called the\r\n_component velocities_ parallel to the axes. If x, y, z be the\r\nco-ordinates of P it is easily proved that\r\n\r\n      dx      dy      dz\r\n  u = --, v = --, w = --.  (1)\r\n      dt      dt      dt\r\n\r\nThe momentum of a particle is the vector obtained by multiplying the\r\nvelocity by the mass m. The _impulse_ of a force in any infinitely small\r\ninterval of time [delta]t is the product of the force into [delta]t; it\r\nis to be regarded as a vector. The total impulse in any finite interval\r\nof time is the integral of the impulses corresponding to the\r\ninfinitesimal elements [delta]t into which the interval may be\r\nsubdivided; the summation of which the integral is the limit is of\r\ncourse to be understood in the vectorial sense.\r\n\r\nNewton's Second Law asserts that change of momentum is equal to the\r\nimpulse; this is a statement as to equality of vectors and so implies\r\nidentity of direction as well as of magnitude. If X, Y, Z are the\r\ncomponents of force, then considering the changes in an infinitely short\r\ntime [delta]t we have, by projection on the co-ordinate axes,\r\n[delta](mu) = X[delta]t, and so on, or\r\n\r\n    du        dv        dw\r\n  m -- = X, m -- = Y, m -- = Z.  (2)\r\n    dt        dt        dt\r\n\r\nFor example, the path of a particle projected anyhow under gravity will\r\nobviously be confined to the vertical plane through the initial\r\ndirection of motion. Taking this as the plane xy, with the axis of x\r\ndrawn horizontally, and that of y vertically upwards, we have X = 0, Y =\r\n-mg; so that\r\n\r\n  d²x      d²y\r\n  --- = 0, --- = -g.  (3)\r\n  dt²      dt²\r\n\r\nThe solution is\r\n\r\n  x = At + B, y = -½ gt² + Ct + D.  (4)\r\n\r\nIf the initial values of x, y, [.x], [.y] are given, we have four\r\nconditions to determine the four arbitrary constants A, B, C, D. Thus if\r\nthe particle start at time t = 0 from the origin, with the component\r\nvelocities u0, v0, we have\r\n\r\n  x = u0t, y = v0t - ½ gt².  (5)\r\n\r\nEliminating t we have the equation of the path, viz.\r\n\r\n      v0      gx²\r\n  y = --- x - ---.  (6)\r\n      u0      2u²\r\n\r\nThis is a parabola with vertical axis, of latus-rectum 2u0²/g. The range\r\non a horizontal plane through O is got by putting y = 0, viz. it is\r\n2u0v0/g. we denote the resultant velocity at any instant by [.s] we have\r\n\r\n  [.s]² = [.x]² + [.y]² = [.s]0² - 2gy.  (7)\r\n\r\nAnother important example is that of a particle subject to an\r\nacceleration which is directed always towards a fixed point O and is\r\nproportional to the distance from O. The motion will evidently be in one\r\nplane, which we take as the plane z = 0. If [mu] be the acceleration at\r\nunit distance, the component accelerations parallel to axes of x and y\r\nthrough O as origin will be -[mu]x, -[mu]y, whence\r\n\r\n  d²x           d²y\r\n  --- = -[mu]x, --- = - [mu]y.  (8)\r\n  dt²           dt²\r\n\r\nThe solution is\r\n\r\n  x = A cos nt + B sin nt, y = C cos nt + D sin nt,  (9)\r\n\r\nwhere n = [root][mu]. If P be the initial position of the particle, we\r\nmay conveniently take OP as axis of x, and draw Oy parallel to the\r\ndirection of motion at P. If OP = a, and [.s]0 be the velocity at P, we\r\nhave, initially, x = a, y = 0, [.x] = 0, [.y] = [.s]0 whence\r\n\r\n  x = a cos nt, y = b sin nt,  (10)\r\n\r\nif b = [.s]0/n. The path is therefore an ellipse of which a, b are\r\nconjugate semi-diameters, and is described in the period\r\n2[pi]/[root][mu]; moreover, the velocity at any point P is equal to\r\n[root][mu]·OD, where OD is the semi-diameter conjugate to OP. This type\r\nof motion is called _elliptic harmonic_. If the co-ordinate axes are the\r\nprincipal axes of the ellipse, the angle nt in (10) is identical with\r\nthe \"excentric angle.\" The motion of the bob of a \"spherical pendulum,\"\r\ni.e. a simple pendulum whose oscillations are not confined to one\r\nvertical plane, is of this character, provided the extreme inclination\r\nof the string to the vertical be small. The acceleration is towards the\r\nvertical through the point of suspension, and is equal to gr/l,\r\napproximately, if r denote distance from this vertical. Hence the path\r\nis approximately an ellipse, and the period is 2[pi] [root](l/g).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.]\r\n\r\n  The above problem is identical with that of the oscillation of a\r\n  particle in a smooth spherical bowl, in the neighbourhood of the\r\n  lowest point. If the bowl has any other shape, the axes Ox, Oy may be\r\n  taken tangential to the lines of curvature at the lowest point O; the\r\n  equations of small motion then are\r\n\r\n    d²x        x     d²y        y\r\n    --- = -g ------, --- = -g ------,  (11)\r\n    dt²      [rho]1  dt²      [rho]2\r\n\r\n  where [rho]1, [rho]2, are the principal radii of curvature at O. The\r\n  motion is therefore the resultant of two simple vibrations in\r\n  perpendicular directions, of periods 2[pi] [root]([rho]1/g),\r\n  2[pi] [root]([rho]2/g). The circumstances are realized in \"Blackburn's\r\n  pendulum,\" which consists of a weight P hanging from a point C of a\r\n  string ACB whose ends A, B are fixed. If E be the point in which the\r\n  line of the string meets AB, we have [rho]1 = CP, [rho]2 = EP. Many\r\n  contrivances for actually drawing the resulting curves have been\r\n  devised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.]\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes convenient to resolve the accelerations in directions\r\nhaving a more intrinsic relation to the path. Thus, in a plane path, let\r\nP, Q be two consecutive positions, corresponding to the times t, t +\r\n[delta]t; and let the normals at P, Q meet in C, making an angle\r\n[delta][psi]. Let v (= [.s]) be the velocity at P, v + [delta]v that at\r\nQ. In the time [delta]t the velocity parallel to the tangent at P\r\nchanges from v to v + [delta]v, ultimately, and the tangential\r\nacceleration at P is therefore dv/dt or [:s]. Again, the velocity\r\nparallel to the normal at P changes from 0 to v[delta][psi], ultimately,\r\nso that the normal acceleration is v d[psi]/dt. Since\r\n\r\n  dv   dv ds     dv    d[psi]     d[psi] ds     v²\r\n  -- = -- -- = v --, v ------ = v ------ -- = -----,  (12)\r\n  dt   ds dt     ds      dt         ds   dt   [rho]\r\n\r\nwhere [rho] is the radius of curvature of the path at P, the tangential\r\nand normal accelerations are also expressed by v dv/ds and v²/[rho],\r\nrespectively. Take, for example, the case of a particle moving on a\r\nsmooth curve in a vertical plane, under the action of gravity and the\r\npressure R of the curve. If the axes of x and y be drawn horizontal and\r\nvertical (upwards), and if [psi] be the inclination of the tangent to\r\nthe horizontal, we have\r\n\r\n     dv                         dy    mv²\r\n  mv -- = - mg sin [psi] = - mg --,  ----- = - mg cos [psi] + R.  (13)\r\n     ds                         ds   [rho]\r\n\r\nThe former equation gives\r\n\r\n  v² = C - 2gy,  (14)\r\n\r\nand the latter then determines R.\r\n\r\n  In the case of the pendulum the tension of the string takes the place\r\n  of the pressure of the curve. If l be the length of the string, [psi]\r\n  its inclination to the downward vertical, we have [delta]s =\r\n  l[delta][psi], so that v = ld[psi]/dt. The tangential resolution then\r\n  gives\r\n\r\n    d²[psi]\r\n  l ------- = - g sin [psi].  (15)\r\n      dt²\r\n\r\n  If we multiply by 2d[psi]/dt and integrate, we obtain\r\n\r\n     / d[psi]\\²   2g\r\n    ( ------  ) = --- cos [psi] + const.,  (16)\r\n     \\  dt   /     l\r\n\r\n  which is seen to be equivalent to (14). If the pendulum oscillate\r\n  between the limits [psi] = ±[alpha], we have\r\n\r\n     /[delta][psi]\\²   2g                              4g\r\n    ( ------------ ) = --- (cos [psi] - cos [alpha]) = --- (sin² ½[alpha] - sin² ½[psi]);  (17)\r\n     \\   dt       /     l                               l\r\n\r\n  and, putting sin ½[psi] = sin ½[alpha]. sin [phi], we find for the\r\n  period ([tau]) of a complete oscillation\r\n\r\n                _½[pi]                         _½[pi]\r\n               /    dt                 / l    /                  d[phi]\r\n    [tau] = 4  |   ------ d[phi] = 4  / --- · |   ------------------------------------\r\n              _/0  d[phi]           \\/   g   _/0  [root](1 - sin² ½[alpha]·sin² [phi])\r\n\r\n                                    / l\r\n                             = 4   / ---·F1(sin ½[alpha]),  (18)\r\n                                 \\/   g\r\n\r\n  in the notation of elliptic integrals.

The following table gives the period, for various amplitudes\r\n  [alpha], in terms of that of oscillation in an infinitely small arc\r\n  [viz. 2[pi] [root](l/g)] as unit.\r\n\r\n    +--------------+----------++--------------+----------+\r\n    | [alpha]/[pi] |  [tau]   || [alpha]/[pi] |  [tau]   |\r\n    +--------------+----------++--------------+----------+\r\n    |      .1      |  1.0062  ||      .6      |  1.2817  |\r\n    |      .2      |  1.0253  ||      .7      |  1.4283  |\r\n    |      .3      |  1.0585  ||      .8      |  1.6551  |\r\n    |      .4      |  1.1087  ||      .9      |  2.0724  |\r\n    |      .5      |  1.1804  ||     1.0      |   [oo]   |\r\n    +--------------+----------++--------------+----------+\r\n\r\n  The value of [tau] can also be obtained as an infinite series, by\r\n  expanding the integrand in (18) by the binomial theorem, and\r\n  integrating term by term.

(20)\r\n\r\n  This becomes infinite for [psi] = [pi], showing that the pendulum only\r\n  tends asymptotically to the highest position.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 67.]\r\n\r\n  The variation of period with amplitude was at one time a hindrance to\r\n  the accurate performance of pendulum clocks, since the errors produced\r\n  are cumulative. It was therefore sought to replace the circular\r\n  pendulum by some other contrivance free from this defect. The equation\r\n  of motion of a particle in any smooth path is\r\n\r\n    d²s\r\n    --- = -g sin [psi],  (21)\r\n    dt²\r\n\r\n  where [psi] is the inclination of the tangent to the horizontal. If\r\n  sin [psi] were accurately and not merely approximately proportional to\r\n  the arc s, say\r\n\r\n    s = k sin [psi],  (22)\r\n\r\n  the equation (21) would assume the same form as § 12 (5). The motion\r\n  along the arc would then be accurately simple-harmonic, and the period\r\n  2[pi][root](k/g) would be the same for all amplitudes. Now equation\r\n  (22) is the intrinsic equation of a cycloid; viz. the curve is that\r\n  traced by a point on the circumference of a circle of radius ¼k which\r\n  rolls on the under side of a horizontal straight line. Since the\r\n  evolute of a cycloid is an equal cycloid the object is attained by\r\n  means of two metal cheeks, having the form of the evolute near the\r\n  cusp, on which the string wraps itself alternately as the pendulum\r\n  swings. The device has long been abandoned, the difficulty being met\r\n  in other ways, but the problem, originally investigated by C. Huygens,\r\n  is important in the history of mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe component accelerations of a point describing a tortuous curve, in\r\nthe directions of the tangent, the principal normal, and the binormal,\r\nrespectively, are found as follows. If [->OV], [->OV´] be vectors\r\nrepresenting the velocities at two consecutive points P, P´ of the path,\r\nthe plane VOV´ is ultimately parallel to the osculating plane of the\r\npath at P; the resultant acceleration is therefore in the osculating\r\nplane. Also, the projections of [->VV´] on OV and on a perpendicular to\r\nOV in the plane VOV´ are [delta]v and v[delta][epsilon], where\r\n[delta][epsilon] is the angle between the directions of the tangents at\r\nP, P´. Since [delta][epsilon] = [delta]s/[rho], where [delta]s = PP´ =\r\nv[delta]t and [rho] is the radius of principal curvature at P, the\r\ncomponent accelerations along the tangent and principal normal are dv/dt\r\nand vd[epsilon]/dt, respectively, or vdv/ds and v²/[rho]. For example,\r\nif a particle moves on a smooth surface, under no forces except the\r\nreaction of the surface, v is constant, and the principal normal to the\r\npath will coincide with the normal to the surface. Hence the path is a\r\n\"geodesic\" on the surface.\r\n\r\nIf we resolve along the tangent to the path (whether plane or tortuous),\r\nthe equation of motion of a particle may be written\r\n\r\n     dv\r\n  mv -- = [T],  (23)\r\n     ds\r\n\r\nwhere [T] is the tangential component of the force. Integrating with\r\nrespect to s we find\r\n                     _\r\n                    / s1\r\n  ½ mv1² - ½ mv0² = |     [T] ds;  (24)\r\n                   _/ s0\r\n\r\ni.e. the increase of kinetic energy between any two positions is equal\r\nto the work done by the forces. The result follows also from the\r\nCartesian equations (2); viz. we have\r\n\r\n  m([.x][:x] + [.y][:y] + [.z][:z]) = X[.x] + Y[.y] + Z[.z],  (25)\r\n\r\nwhence, on integration with respect to t,\r\n\r\n                               _\r\n                              /\r\n  ½m([.x]² + [.y]² + [.z]²) = |(X[.x] + Y[.y] + Z[.z]) dt + const.\r\n                             _/\r\n                               _\r\n                              /\r\n                            = |(X dx + Y dy + Z dz) + const.  (26)\r\n                             _/\r\n\r\nIf the axes be rectangular, this has the same interpretation as (24).\r\n\r\nSuppose now that we have a constant field of force; i.e. the force\r\nacting on the particle is always the same at the same place. The work\r\nwhich must be done by forces extraneous to the field in order to bring\r\nthe particle from rest in some standard position A to rest in any other\r\nposition P will not necessarily be the same for all paths between A and\r\nP. If it is different for different paths, then by bringing the particle\r\nfrom A to P by one path, and back again from P to A by another, we might\r\nsecure a gain of work, and the process could be repeated indefinitely.\r\nIf the work required is the same for all paths between A and P, and\r\ntherefore zero for a closed circuit, the field is said to be\r\n_conservative_. In this case the work required to bring the particle\r\nfrom rest at A to rest at P is called the _potential energy_ of the\r\nparticle in the position P; we denote it by V. If PP´ be a linear\r\nelement [delta]s drawn in any direction from P, and S be the force due\r\nto the field, resolved in the direction PP´, we have [delta]V =\r\n-S[delta]s or\r\n\r\n      [dP]V\r\n  S = -----.  (27)\r\n      [dP]s\r\n\r\nIn particular, by taking PP´ parallel to each of the (rectangular)\r\nco-ordinate axes in succession, we find\r\n\r\n      [dP]V      [dP]V      [dP]V\r\n  X = -----, Y = -----, Z = -----.  (28)\r\n      [dP]x      [dP]y      [dP]z\r\n\r\nThe equation (24) or (26) now gives\r\n\r\n  ½ mv1² + V1 = ½ mv0² + V0;  (29)\r\n\r\ni.e. the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is constant when no\r\nwork is done by extraneous forces. For example, if the field be that due\r\nto gravity we have V = fmgdy = mgy + const., if the axis of y be drawn\r\nvertically upwards; hence\r\n\r\n  ½ mv² + mgy = const.  (30)\r\n\r\nThis applies to motion on a smooth curve, as well as to the free motion\r\nof a projectile; cf. (7), (14). Again, in the case of a force Kr towards\r\nO, where r denotes distance from O we have V = [int] Kr dr = ½Kr² +\r\nconst., whence\r\n\r\n  ½ mv² + ½ Kr² = const.  (31)\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the orbit is in this case an ellipse; also that if\r\nwe put [mu] = K/m the velocity at any point P is v = [root][mu]·OD,\r\nwhere OD is the semi-diameter conjugate to OP. Hence (31) is consistent\r\nwith the known property of the ellipse that OP² + OD² is constant.\r\n\r\n  The forms assumed by the dynamical equations when the axes of\r\n  reference are themselves in motion will be considered in § 21. At\r\n  present we take only the case where the rectangular axes Ox, Oy rotate\r\n  in their own plane, with angular velocity [omega] about Oz, which is\r\n  fixed. In the interval [delta]t the projections of the line joining\r\n  the origin to any point (x, y, z) on the directions of the co-ordinate\r\n  axes at time t are changed from x, y, z to (x + [delta]x) cos\r\n  [omega][delta]t - (y + [delta]y) sin [omega][delta]t, (x + [delta]x)\r\n  sin [omega][delta]t + (y + [delta]y) cos [omega][delta]t, z\r\n  respectively. Hence the component velocities parallel to the\r\n  instantaneous positions of the co-ordinate axes at time t are\r\n\r\n    u = [.x] - [omega]y, v = [.y] + [omega]z, [omega] = [.z].  (32)\r\n\r\n  In the same way we find that the component accelerations are\r\n\r\n    [.u] - [omega]v, [.v] + [omega]u, [.omega].  (33)\r\n\r\n  Hence if [omega] be constant the equations of motion take the forms\r\n\r\n    m([:x] - 2[omega][.y] - [omega]²[.x]) = X, m([:y] + 2[omega][.x] - [omega]²y) = Y, m[:z] = Z.  (34)\r\n\r\n  These become identical with the equations of motion relative to fixed\r\n  axes provided we introduce a fictitious force m[omega]²r acting\r\n  outwards from the axis of z, where r = [root](x² + y²), and a second\r\n  fictitious force 2m[omega]v at right angles to the path, where v is\r\n  the component of the relative velocity parallel to the plane xy. The\r\n  former force is called by French writers the _force centrifuge\r\n  ordinaire_, and the latter the _force centrifuge composée_, or _force\r\n  de Coriolis_. As an application of (34) we may take the case of a\r\n  symmetrical Blackburn's pendulum hanging from a horizontal bar which\r\n  is made to rotate about a vertical axis half-way between the points\r\n  of attachment of the upper string. The equations of small motion are\r\n  then of the type\r\n\r\n    [:x] - 2[omega][.y] - [omega]²x = -p²x, [:y] + 2[omega][.x] - [omega]²y = -q²y.  (35)\r\n\r\n  This is satisfied by\r\n\r\n    [:x] = A cos ([sigma]t + [epsilon]), y = B sin ([sigma]t + [epsilon]),  (36)\r\n\r\n  provided\r\n\r\n    ([sigma]² + [omega]² - p²)A + 2[sigma][omega]B = 0, \\  (37)\r\n    2[sigma][omega]A + ([sigma]² + [omega]² - q²)B = 0. /\r\n\r\n  Eliminating the ratio A : B we have\r\n\r\n    ([sigma]² + [omega]² - p²)([sigma]² + [omega]² - q²) - 4[sigma]²[omega]² = 0.  (38)\r\n\r\n  It is easily proved that the roots of this quadratic in [sigma]² are\r\n  always real, and that they are moreover both positive unless [omega]²\r\n  lies between p² and q². The ratio B/A is determined in each case by\r\n  either of the equations (37); hence each root of the quadratic gives a\r\n  solution of the type (36), with two arbitrary constants A, [epsilon].\r\n  Since the equations (35) are linear, these two solutions are to be\r\n  superposed. If the quadratic (38) has a negative root, the\r\n  trigonometrical functions in (36) are to be replaced by real\r\n  exponentials, and the position x = 0, y = 0 is unstable. This occurs\r\n  only when the period (2[pi]/[omega]) of revolution of the arm lies\r\n  between the two periods (2[pi]/p, 2[pi]/q) of oscillation when the arm\r\n  is fixed.\r\n\r\n§ 14. _Central Forces. Hodograph._--The motion of a particle subject to\r\na force which passes always through a fixed point O is necessarily in a\r\nplane orbit. For its investigation we require two equations; these may\r\nbe obtained in a variety of forms.\r\n\r\nSince the impulse of the force in any element of time [delta]t has zero\r\nmoment about O, the same will be true of the additional momentum\r\ngenerated. Hence the moment of the momentum (considered as a localized\r\nvector) about O will be constant. In symbols, if v be the velocity and p\r\nthe perpendicular from O to the tangent to the path,\r\n\r\n  pv = h,  (1)\r\n\r\nwhere h is a constant. If [delta]s be an element of the path, p[delta]s\r\nis twice the area enclosed by [delta]s and the radii drawn to its\r\nextremities from O. Hence if [delta]A be this area, we have [delta]A = ½\r\np[delta]s = ½ h[delta]t, or\r\n\r\n  dA\r\n  -- = ½h.  (2)\r\n  dt\r\n\r\nHence equal areas are swept over by the radius vector in equal times.\r\n\r\nIf P be the acceleration towards O, we have\r\n\r\n    dv      dr\r\n  v -- = -P --,  (3)\r\n    ds      ds\r\n\r\nsince dr/ds is the cosine of the angle between the directions of r and\r\n[delta]s. We will suppose that P is a function of r only; then\r\nintegrating (3) we find\r\n            _\r\n           /\r\n  ½ v² = - | P dr + const.,  (4)\r\n          _/\r\n\r\nwhich is recognized as the equation of energy. Combining this with (1)\r\nwe have\r\n              _\r\n  h²         /\r\n  -- = C - 2 | P dr,  (5)\r\n  p²        _/\r\n\r\nwhich completely determines the path except as to its orientation with\r\nrespect to O.\r\n\r\nIf the law of attraction be that of the inverse square of the distance,\r\nwe have P = [mu]/r², and\r\n\r\n  h²        2[mu]\r\n  --  = C + -----.  (6)\r\n  p²        [tau]\r\n\r\nNow in a conic whose focus is at O we have\r\n\r\n   l     2    1\r\n  --- = -- ± ---,  (7)\r\n   p²    r    a\r\n\r\nwhere l is half the latus-rectum, a is half the major axis, and the\r\nupper or lower sign is to be taken according as the conic is an ellipse\r\nor hyperbola. In the intermediate case of the parabola we have a = [oo]\r\nand the last term disappears. The equations (6) and (7) are identified\r\nby putting\r\n\r\n  l = h²/[mu], a = ± [mu]/C.  (8)\r\n\r\nSince\r\n\r\n       h²        / 2     1 \\\r\n  v² = -- = [mu]( --- ± --- ),  (9)\r\n       p²        \\ r     a /\r\n\r\nit appears that the orbit is an ellipse, parabola or hyperbola,\r\naccording as v² is less than, equal to, or greater than 2[mu]/r. Now it\r\nappears from (6) that 2[mu]/r is the square of the velocity which would\r\nbe acquired by a particle falling from rest at infinity to the distance\r\nr. Hence the character of the orbit depends on whether the velocity at\r\nany point is less than, equal to, or greater than the _velocity from\r\ninfinity_, as it is called. In an elliptic orbit the area [pi]ab is\r\nswept over in the time\r\n\r\n      [pi]ab   2[pi]a^(3/2)\r\n  r = ------ = ------------,  (10)\r\n        ½h      [root][mu]\r\n\r\nsince h = [mu]^½ l^½ = [mu]^½ ba^-½ by (8).\r\n\r\n  The converse problem, to determine the law of force under which a\r\n  given orbit can be described about a given pole, is solved by\r\n  differentiating (5) with respect to r; thus\r\n\r\n        h² dp\r\n    P = -----.  (11)\r\n        p³ dr\r\n\r\n  In the case of an ellipse described about the centre as pole we have\r\n\r\n    a²b²\r\n    ---- = a² + b² - r²;  (12)\r\n     p²\r\n\r\n  hence P = [mu]r, if [mu] = h²/a²b². This merely shows that a\r\n  particular ellipse may be described under the law of the direct\r\n  distance provided the circumstances of projection be suitably\r\n  adjusted. But since an ellipse can always be constructed with a given\r\n  centre so as to touch a given line at a given point, and to have a\r\n  given value of ab (= h/[root][mu]) we infer that the orbit will be\r\n  elliptic whatever the initial circumstances. Also the period is\r\n  2[pi]ab/h = 2[pi]/[root][mu], as previously found.\r\n\r\n  Again, in the equiangular spiral we have p = r sin[alpha], and\r\n  therefore P = [mu]/r³, if [mu] = h²/sin²[alpha]. But since an\r\n  equiangular spiral having a given pole is completely determined by a\r\n  given point and a given tangent, this type of orbit is not a general\r\n  one for the law of the inverse cube. In order that the spiral may be\r\n  described it is necessary that the velocity of projection should be\r\n  adjusted to make h = [root][mu]·sin[alpha]. Similarly, in the case of\r\n  a circle with the pole on the circumference we have p² = r²/2a, P =\r\n  [mu]/r^5, if [mu] = 8h²a²; but this orbit is not a general one for the\r\n  law of the inverse fifth power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.]\r\n\r\nIn astronomical and other investigations relating to central forces it\r\nis often convenient to use polar co-ordinates with the centre of force\r\nas pole. Let P, Q be the positions of a moving point at times t, t +\r\n[delta]t, and write OP = r, OQ = r + [delta]r, [angle]POQ =\r\n[delta][theta], O being any fixed origin. If u, v be the component\r\nvelocities at P along and perpendicular to OP (in the direction of\r\n[theta] increasing), we have\r\n\r\n          [delta]r   dr           r[delta][theta]     d[theta]\r\n  u = lim.-------- = --, v = lim. --------------- = r --------.  (13)\r\n          [delta]t   dt              [delta]t            dt\r\n\r\nAgain, the velocities parallel and perpendicular to OP change in the\r\ntime [delta]t from u, v to u - v[delta][theta], v + u[delta][theta],\r\nultimately. The component accelerations at P in these directions are\r\ntherefore\r\n\r\n  du     d[theta]   d²r      /d[theta]\\²      \\\r\n  -- - v -------- = --- - r ( -------- ),     |\r\n  dt        dt      dt²      \\  dt    /       |\r\n                                               >  (14)\r\n  dv     d[theta]     1   d   /   d[theta]\\   |\r\n  -- + u -------- =  --- --- ( r² -------- ), |\r\n  dt        dt        r  dt   \\      dt   /   /\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a central force, with O as pole, the transverse\r\nacceleration vanishes, so that\r\n\r\n  r²d[theta]/dt = h,  (15)\r\n\r\nwhere h is constant; this shows (again) that the radius vector sweeps\r\nover equal areas in equal times. The radial resolution gives\r\n\r\n  d²r      /d[theta]\\²\r\n  --- - r ( -------- ) = -P,  (16)\r\n  dt²      \\   dt   /\r\n\r\nwhere P, as before, denotes the acceleration towards O. If in this we\r\nput r = 1/u, and eliminate t by means of (15), we obtain the general\r\ndifferential equation of central orbits, viz.\r\n\r\n     d²u           P\r\n  --------- + u = ----.  (17)\r\n  d[theta]²       h²u²\r\n\r\n  If, for example, the law be that of the inverse square, we have P =\r\n  [mu]u², and the solution is of the form\r\n\r\n         [mu]\r\n    u = ------ {1 + e cos ([theta] - [alpha])},  (18)\r\n          h²\r\n\r\n  where e, [alpha] are arbitrary constants. This is recognized as the\r\n  polar equation of a conic referred to the focus, the half latus-rectum\r\n  being h²/[mu].\r\n\r\n  The law of the inverse cube P = [mu]u³ is interesting by way of\r\n  contrast. The orbits may be divided into two classes according as h²\r\n  <> [mu], i.e. according as the transverse velocity (hu) is greater or\r\n  less than the velocity [root]([mu]·u) appropriate to a circular orbit\r\n  at the same distance. In the former case the equation (17) takes the\r\n  form\r\n\r\n       d²u\r\n    -------- + m²u = 0,  (19)\r\n    d[theta]²\r\n\r\n  the solution of which is\r\n\r\n    au = sin m ([theta] - [alpha]).  (20)\r\n\r\n  The orbit has therefore two asymptotes, inclined at an angle [pi]/m.\r\n  In the latter case the differential equation is of the form\r\n\r\n       d²u\r\n    --------- = m²u,  (21)\r\n    d[theta]²\r\n\r\n  so that\r\n\r\n    u = A e^(m[theta]) + B e^(-m[theta])  (22)\r\n\r\n  If A, B have the same sign, this is equivalent to\r\n\r\n    au = cosh m[theta],  (23)\r\n\r\n  if the origin of [theta] be suitably adjusted; hence r has a maximum\r\n  value [alpha], and the particle ultimately approaches the pole\r\n  asymptotically by an infinite number of convolutions. If A, B have\r\n  opposite signs the form is\r\n\r\n    au = sinh m[theta],  (24)\r\n\r\n  this has an asymptote parallel to [theta] = 0, but the path near the\r\n  origin has the same general form as in the case of (23). If A or B\r\n  vanish we have an equiangular spiral, and the velocity at infinity is\r\n  zero. In the critical case of h² = [mu], we have d²u/d[theta]² = 0,\r\n  and\r\n\r\n    u = A[theta] + B;  (25)\r\n\r\n  the orbit is therefore a \"reciprocal spiral,\" except in the special\r\n  case of A = 0, when it is a circle. It will be seen that unless the\r\n  conditions be exactly adjusted for a circular orbit the particle will\r\n  either recede to infinity or approach the pole asymptotically. This\r\n  problem was investigated by R. Cotes (1682-1716), and the various\r\n  curves obtained arc known as _Coles's spirals_.\r\n\r\nA point on a central orbit where the radial velocity (dr/dt) vanishes is\r\ncalled an _apse_, and the corresponding radius is called an _apse-line_.\r\nIf the force is always the same at the same distance any apse-line will\r\ndivide the orbit symmetrically, as is seen by imagining the velocity at\r\nthe apse to be reversed. It follows that the angle between successive\r\napse-lines is constant; it is called the _apsidal angle_ of the orbit.\r\n\r\nIf in a central orbit the velocity is equal to the velocity from\r\ninfinity, we have, from (5),\r\n          _\r\n  h²     / [oo]\r\n  -- = 2 |    P dr;  (26)\r\n  p²    _/ r\r\n\r\nthis determines the form of the critical orbit, as it is called. If P =\r\n[mu]/r^[n], its polar equation is\r\n\r\n  r^m cos m[theta] = a^m,  (27)\r\n\r\nwhere m = ½(3 - n), except in the case n = 3, when the orbit is an\r\nequiangular spiral. The case n = 2 gives the parabola as before.\r\n\r\n  If we eliminate d[theta]/dt between (15) and (16) we obtain\r\n\r\n    d²r   h²\r\n    --- - -- = -P = -f(r),\r\n    dt²   r³\r\n\r\n  say. We may apply this to the investigation of the stability of a\r\n  circular orbit. Assuming that r = a + x, where x is small, we have,\r\n  approximately,\r\n\r\n    d²x   h²  /     3x\\\r\n    --- - -- ( 1 - --  ) = -f(a) - xf´(a).\r\n    dt²   r³  \\     a /\r\n\r\n  Hence if h and a be connected by the relation h² = a³f(a) proper to a\r\n  circular orbit, we have\r\n           _               _\r\n    d²x   |          3      |\r\n    --- + | f´(a) + --- f(a)| x = 0.  (28)\r\n    dt²   |_         a     _|\r\n\r\n  If the coefficient of x be positive the variations of x are\r\n  simple-harmonic, and x can remain permanently small; the circular\r\n  orbit is then said to be stable. The condition for this may be written\r\n        _      _\r\n     d |        |\r\n    -- | a³f(a) | > 0,  (29)\r\n    da |_      _|\r\n\r\n  i.e. the intensity of the force in the region for which r = a, nearly,\r\n  must diminish with increasing distance less rapidly than according to\r\n  the law of the inverse cube. Again, the half-period of x is\r\n  [pi]/sqrt[f´(a) + 3^{-1}f(a)], and since the angular velocity in the\r\n  orbit is h/a², approximately, the apsidal angle is, ultimately,\r\n               _                _\r\n            / |       f(a)       |\r\n    [pi]   /  |  --------------- |,  (30)\r\n         \\/   |_ af´(a) + 3f(a) _|\r\n\r\n  or, in the case of f(a) = [mu]/r^n, [pi]/[root](3 - n). This is in\r\n  agreement with the known results for n = 2, n = -1.\r\n\r\n  We have seen that under the law of the inverse square all finite\r\n  orbits are elliptical. The question presents itself whether there\r\n  then is any other law of force, giving a finite velocity from\r\n  infinity, under which all finite orbits are necessarily closed curves.\r\n  If this is the case, the apsidal angle must evidently be commensurable\r\n  with [pi], and since it cannot vary discontinuously the apsidal angle\r\n  in a nearly circular orbit must be constant. Equating the expression\r\n  (30) to [pi]/m, we find that f(a) = C/a^n, where n = 3 - m². The\r\n  force must therefore vary as a power of the distance, and n must be\r\n  less than 3. Moreover, the case n = 2 is the only one in which the\r\n  critical orbit (27) can be regarded as the limiting form of a closed\r\n  curve. Hence the only law of force which satisfies the conditions is\r\n  that of the inverse square.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of § 13 the velocity of a moving point P was\r\nrepresented by a vector [->OV] drawn from a fixed origin O. The locus of\r\nthe point V is called the _hodograph_ (q.v.); and it appears that the\r\nvelocity of the point V along the hodograph represents in magnitude and\r\nin direction the acceleration in the original orbit. Thus in the case of\r\na plane orbit, if v be the velocity of P, [psi] the inclination of the\r\ndirection of motion to some fixed direction, the polar co-ordinates of V\r\nmay be taken to be v, [psi]; hence the velocities of V along and\r\nperpendicular to OV will be dv/dt and vd[psi]/dt. These expressions\r\ntherefore give the tangential and normal accelerations of P; cf. § 13\r\n(12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.]\r\n\r\n  In the motion of a projectile under gravity the hodograph is a\r\n  vertical line described with constant velocity. In elliptic harmonic\r\n  motion the velocity of P is parallel and proportional to the\r\n  semi-diameter CD which is conjugate to the radius CP; the hodograph is\r\n  therefore an ellipse similar to the actual orbit. In the case of a\r\n  central orbit described under the law of the inverse square we have v\r\n  = h/SY = h. SZ/b², where S is the centre of force, SY is the\r\n  perpendicular to the tangent at P, and Z is the point where YS meets\r\n  the auxiliary circle again. Hence the hodograph is similar and\r\n  similarly situated to the locus of Z (the auxiliary circle) turned\r\n  about S through a right angle. This applies to an elliptic or\r\n  hyperbolic orbit; the case of the parabolic orbit may be examined\r\n  separately or treated as a limiting case. The annexed fig. 70 exhibits\r\n  the various cases, with the hodograph in its proper orientation. The\r\n  pole O of the hodograph is inside on or outside the circle, according\r\n  as the orbit is an ellipse, parabola or hyperbola. In any case of a\r\n  central orbit the hodograph (when turned through a right angle) is\r\n  similar and similarly situated to the \"reciprocal polar\" of the orbit\r\n  with respect to the centre of force. Thus for a circular orbit with\r\n  the centre of force at an excentric point, the hodograph is a conic\r\n  with the pole as focus. In the case of a particle oscillating under\r\n  gravity on a smooth cycloid from rest at the cusp the hodograph is a\r\n  circle through the pole, described with constant velocity.\r\n\r\n§ 15. _Kinetics of a System of Discrete Particles._--The momenta of the\r\nseveral particles constitute a system of localized vectors which, for\r\npurposes of resolving and taking moments, may be reduced like a system\r\nof forces in statics (§ 8). Thus taking any point O as base, we have\r\nfirst a _linear momentum_ whose components referred to rectangular axes\r\nthrough O are\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](m[.x]), [Sigma](m[.y]), [Sigma](m[.z]);  (1)\r\n\r\nits representative vector is the same whatever point O be chosen.\r\nSecondly, we have an _angular momentum_ whose components are\r\n\r\n  [Sigma]{m(y[.z] - z[.y])}, [Sigma]{m(z[.x] - xz[.z])}, [Sigma]{m(x[.y] - y[.x])},  (2)\r\n\r\nthese being the sums of the moments of the momenta of the several\r\nparticles about the respective axes. This is subject to the same\r\nrelations as a couple in statics; it may be represented by a vector\r\nwhich will, however, in general vary with the position of O.\r\n\r\nThe linear momentum is the same as if the whole mass were concentrated\r\nat the centre of mass G, and endowed with the velocity of this point.\r\nThis follows at once from equation (8) of § 11, if we imagine the two\r\nconfigurations of the system there referred to to be those corresponding\r\nto the instants t, t + [delta]t. Thus\r\n\r\n   __  /   [->PP]  \\      __     [->GG´]\r\n  \\   ( m·--------  )  = \\   (m)·--------.  (3)\r\n  /__  \\  [delta]t /     /__     [delta]t\r\n\r\nAnalytically we have\r\n\r\n                    d                           d[|x]\r\n  [Sigma](m[.x]) = --- [Sigma](mx) = [Sigma](m)·-----.  (4)\r\n                   dt                            dt\r\n\r\nwith two similar formulae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.]\r\n\r\nAgain, if the instantaneous position of G be taken as base, the angular\r\nmomentum of the absolute motion is the same as the angular momentum of\r\nthe motion relative to G. For the velocity of a particle m at P may be\r\nreplaced by two components one of which (v) is identical in magnitude\r\nand direction with the velocity of G, whilst the other (v) is the\r\nvelocity relative to G. The aggregate of the components mv of momentum\r\nis equivalent to a single localized vector [Sigma](m)·v in a line\r\nthrough G, and has therefore zero moment about any axis through G; hence\r\nin taking moments about such an axis we need only regard the velocities\r\nrelative to G. In symbols, we have\r\n\r\n                                          /  d[|z]     d[|y]\\\r\n  [Sigma]{m(y[.z] - z[.y])} = [Sigma](m)·( y ----- - z ----- ) + [Sigma]{m([eta][zeta] - [.zeta][eta])}.  (5)\r\n                                          \\    dt        dt /\r\n\r\nsince [Sigma](m[xi]) = 0, [Sigma](m[xi]) = 0, and so on, the notation\r\nbeing as in § 11. This expresses that the moment of momentum about any\r\nfixed axis (e.g. Ox) is equal to the moment of momentum of the motion\r\nrelative to G about a parallel axis through G, together with the moment\r\nof momentum of the whole mass supposed concentrated at G and moving with\r\nthis point. If in (5) we make O coincide with the instantaneous position\r\nof G, we have [|x], [|y], [|z] = 0, and the theorem follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the rates of change of the components of the angular momentum\r\nof the motion relative to G referred to G as a moving base, are equal to\r\nthe rates of change of the corresponding components of angular momentum\r\nrelative to a fixed base coincident with the instantaneous position of\r\nG. For let G´ be a consecutive position of G. At the instant t +\r\n[delta]t the momenta of the system are equivalent to a linear momentum\r\nrepresented by a localized vector [Sigma](m)·(v + [delta]v) in a line\r\nthrough G´ tangential to the path of G´, together with a certain angular\r\nmomentum. Now the moment of this localized vector with respect to any\r\naxis through G is zero, to the first order of [delta]t, since the\r\nperpendicular distance of G from the tangent line at G´ is of the order\r\n([delta]t)². Analytically we have from (5),\r\n\r\n   d                                            /  d[|z]²     d²[|y] \\     d\r\n  --- [Sigma] {m (y[.z] - z[.y])} = [Sigma](m)·( y ------ - z ------- ) + --- [Sigma] {m([eta][zeta - [zeta][.eta])}  (6)\r\n  dt                                            \\    dt²        dt²  /    dt\r\n\r\nIf we put x, y, z = 0, the theorem is proved as regards axes parallel to\r\nOx.\r\n\r\nNext consider the kinetic energy of the system. If from a fixed point O\r\nwe draw vectors [->OV1], [->OV2] to represent the velocities of the\r\nseveral particles m1, m2 ..., and if we construct the vector\r\n\r\n\r\n           [Sigma](m·[->OV])\r\n  [->OK] = -----------------  (7)\r\n               [Sigma](m)\r\n\r\nthis will represent the velocity of the mass-centre, by (3). We find,\r\nexactly as in the proof of Lagrange's First Theorem (§ 11), that\r\n\r\n  ½[Sigma](m·OV²) = ½[Sigma](m)·OK² + ½[Sigma](m·KV²);  (8)\r\n\r\ni.e. the total kinetic energy is equal to the kinetic energy of the\r\nwhole mass supposed concentrated at G and moving with this point,\r\ntogether with the kinetic energy of the motion relative to G. The latter\r\nmay be called the _internal kinetic energy_ of the system. Analytically\r\nwe have\r\n                                                    _                                 _\r\n                                                   |  /d[|x]\\²    /d[|y]\\²    /d[|z]\\  |\r\n  ½[Sigma]{m([.x]² + [.y]² + [.z]²)} = ½[Sigma](m)·| ( ----- ) + ( ----- ) + ( ----- ) |\r\n                                                   |_ \\ dt  /     \\ dt  /     \\ dt  / _|\r\n\r\n                                     + ½[Sigma] {m([zeta]² + [.eta]² + [zeta]²)}.  (9)\r\n\r\nThere is also an analogue to Lagrange's Second Theorem, viz.\r\n\r\n                      [Sigma][Sigma] (m_p m_q·V_p V_q²)\r\n  ½[Sigma](m·KV²) = ½ ---------------------------------  (10)\r\n                                   [Sigma]m\r\n\r\nwhich expresses the internal kinetic energy in terms of the relative\r\nvelocities of the several pairs of particles. This formula is due to\r\nMöbius.\r\n\r\nThe preceding theorems are purely kinematical. We have now to consider\r\nthe effect of the forces acting on the particles. These may be divided\r\ninto two categories; we have first, the _extraneous forces_ exerted on\r\nthe various particles from without, and, secondly, the mutual or\r\n_internal forces_ between the various pairs of particles. It is assumed\r\nthat these latter are subject to the law of equality of action and\r\nreaction. If the equations of motion of each particle be formed\r\nseparately, each such internal force will appear twice over, with\r\nopposite signs for its components, viz. as affecting the motion of each\r\nof the two particles between which it acts. The full working out is in\r\ngeneral difficult, the comparatively simple problem of \"three bodies,\"\r\nfor instance, in gravitational astronomy being still unsolved, but some\r\ngeneral theorems can be formulated.\r\n\r\nThe first of these may be called the _Principle of Linear Momentum_. If\r\nthere are no extraneous forces, the resultant linear momentum is\r\nconstant in every respect. For consider any two particles at P and Q,\r\nacting on one another with equal and opposite forces in the line PQ. In\r\nthe time [delta]t a certain impulse is given to the first particle in\r\nthe direction (say) from P to Q, whilst an equal and opposite impulse is\r\ngiven to the second in the direction from Q to P. Since these impulses\r\nproduce equal and opposite momenta in the two particles, the resultant\r\nlinear momentum of the system is unaltered. If extraneous forces act, it\r\nis seen in like manner that the resultant linear momentum of the system\r\nis in any given time modified by the geometric addition of the total\r\nimpulse of the extraneous forces. It follows, by the preceding kinematic\r\ntheory, that the mass-centre G of the system will move exactly as if the\r\nwhole mass were concentrated there and were acted on by the extraneous\r\nforces applied parallel to their original directions. For example, the\r\nmass-centre of a system free from extraneous force will describe a\r\nstraight line with constant velocity. Again, the mass-centre of a chain\r\nof particles connected by strings, projected anyhow under gravity, will\r\ndescribe a parabola.\r\n\r\nThe second general result is the _Principle of Angular Momentum_. If\r\nthere are no extraneous forces, the moment of momentum about any fixed\r\naxis is constant. For in time [delta]t the mutual action between two\r\nparticles at P and Q produces equal and opposite momenta in the line PQ,\r\nand these will have equal and opposite moments about the fixed axis. If\r\nextraneous forces act, the total angular momentum about any fixed axis\r\nis in time [delta]t increased by the total extraneous impulse about that\r\naxis. The kinematical relations above explained now lead to the\r\nconclusion that in calculating the effect of extraneous forces in an\r\ninfinitely short time [delta]t we may take moments about an axis passing\r\nthrough the instantaneous position of G exactly as if G were fixed;\r\nmoreover, the result will be the same whether in this process we employ\r\nthe true velocities of the particles or merely their velocities relative\r\nto G. If there are no extraneous forces, or if the extraneous forces\r\nhave zero moment about any axis through G, the vector which represents\r\nthe resultant angular momentum relative to G is constant in every\r\nrespect. A plane through G perpendicular to this vector has a fixed\r\ndirection in space, and is called the _invariable plane_; it may\r\nsometimes be conveniently used as a plane of reference.\r\n\r\n  For example, if we have two particles connected by a string, the\r\n  invariable plane passes through the string, and if [omega] be the\r\n  angular velocity in this plane, the angular momentum relative to G is\r\n\r\n    m1[omega]1r1·r1 + m2[omega]r2·r2 = (m1r1² + m2r2²)[omega],\r\n\r\n  where r1, r2 are the distances of m1, m2 from their mass-centre G.\r\n  Hence if the extraneous forces (e.g. gravity) have zero moment about\r\n  G, [omega] will be constant. Again, the tension R of the string is\r\n  given by\r\n\r\n                        m1m2\r\n    R = m1[omega]²r1 = ------- [omega]²a,\r\n                       m1 + m2\r\n\r\n  where a = r1 + r2. Also by (10) the internal kinetic energy is\r\n\r\n       m1m2\r\n    ½ ------- [omega]²a².\r\n      m1 + m2\r\n\r\nThe increase of the kinetic energy of the system in any interval of time\r\nwill of course be equal to the total work done by all the forces acting\r\non the particles. In many questions relating to systems of discrete\r\nparticles the internal force R_pq (which we will reckon positive when\r\nattractive) between any two particles m_p, m_q is a function only of the\r\ndistance r_pq between them. In this case the work done by the internal\r\nforces will be represented by\r\n            _\r\n           /\r\n  -[Sigma] | R_(pg) dr_(pq),\r\n          _/\r\n\r\nwhen the summation includes every pair of particles, and each integral\r\nis to be taken between the proper limits. If we write\r\n               _\r\n              /\r\n  V = [Sigma] | R_(pq) dr_(pq),  (11)\r\n             _/\r\n\r\nwhen r_pq ranges from its value in some standard configuration A of the\r\nsystem to its value in any other configuration P, it is plain that V\r\nrepresents the work which would have to be done in order to bring the\r\nsystem from rest in the configuration A to rest in the configuration P.\r\nHence V is a definite function of the configuration P; it is called the\r\n_internal potential energy_. If T denote the kinetic energy, we may say\r\nthen that the sum T + V is in any interval of time increased by an\r\namount equal to the work done by the extraneous forces. In particular,\r\nif there are no extraneous forces T + V is constant. Again, if some of\r\nthe extraneous forces are due to a conservative field of force, the work\r\nwhich they do may be reckoned as a diminution of the potential energy\r\nrelative to the field as in § 13.\r\n\r\n§ 16. _Kinetics of a Rigid Body. Fundamental Principles._--When we pass\r\nfrom the consideration of discrete particles to that of continuous\r\ndistributions of matter, we require some physical postulate over and\r\nabove what is contained in the Laws of Motion, in their original\r\nformulation. This additional postulate may be introduced under various\r\nforms. One plan is to assume that any body whatever may be treated as if\r\nit were composed of material particles, i.e. mathematical points endowed\r\nwith inertia coefficients, separated by finite intervals, and acting on\r\none another with forces in the lines joining them subject to the law of\r\nequality of action and reaction. In the case of a rigid body we must\r\nsuppose that those forces adjust themselves so as to preserve the mutual\r\ndistances of the various particles unaltered. On this basis we can\r\npredicate the principles of linear and angular momentum, as in § 15.\r\n\r\nAn alternative procedure is to adopt the principle first formally\r\nenunciated by J. Le R. d'Alembert and since known by his name. If x, y,\r\nz be the rectangular co-ordinates of a mass-element m, the expressions\r\nm[:x], m[:y], m[:z] must be equal to the components of the total force\r\non m, these forces being partly extraneous and partly forces exerted on\r\nm by other mass-elements of the system. Hence (m[:x], m[:y], m[:z]) is\r\ncalled the actual or _effective_ force on m. According to d'Alembert's\r\nformulation, the extraneous forces together with the _effective forces\r\nreversed_ fulfil the statical conditions of equilibrium. In other words,\r\nthe whole assemblage of effective forces is statically equivalent to the\r\nextraneous forces. This leads, by the principles of § 8, to the\r\nequations\r\n\r\n  [Sigma](m[:x]) = X, [Sigma](m[:y]) = Y, [Sigma](m[:z]) = Z,                               \\\r\n                                                                                             >  (1)\r\n  [Sigma]{m(y[:z] - z[:y]) = L, [Sigma]{m(z[:x] - x[:z]) = M, [Sigma]{m(x[:y] - y[:x]) = N, /\r\n\r\nwhere (X, Y, Z) and (L, M, N) are the force--and couple--constituents of\r\nthe system of extraneous forces, referred to O as base, and the\r\nsummations extend over all the mass-elements of the system. These\r\nequations may be written\r\n\r\n   d                       d                       d\r\n  --- [Sigma](m[.x]) = X, --- [Sigma](m[.y]) = Y, --- [Sigma](m[.z]) = Z,                             \\\r\n  dt                      dt                      dt                                                   |                                                                   } (2)\r\n                                                                                                        >  (2)\r\n   d                                 d                               d                                 |\r\n  --- [Sigma]{m(y[.z] - z[.y]) = L, --- [Sigma]{m(z[.x]-x[.z]) = M, --- [Sigma]{m(x[.y] - y[.x]) = N, /\r\n  dt                                dt                              dt\r\n\r\nand so express that the rate of change of the linear momentum in any\r\nfixed direction (e.g. that of Ox) is equal to the total extraneous force\r\nin that direction, and that the rate of change of the angular momentum\r\nabout any fixed axis is equal to the moment of the extraneous forces\r\nabout that axis. If we integrate with respect to t between fixed limits,\r\nwe obtain the principles of linear and angular momentum in the form\r\npreviously given. Hence, whichever form of postulate we adopt, we are\r\nled to the principles of linear and angular momentum, which form in fact\r\nthe basis of all our subsequent work. It is to be noticed that the\r\npreceding statements are not intended to be restricted to rigid bodies;\r\nthey are assumed to hold for all material systems whatever. The peculiar\r\nstatus of rigid bodies is that the principles in question are in most\r\ncases sufficient for the complete determination of the motion, the\r\ndynamical equations (1 or 2) being equal in number to the degrees of\r\nfreedom (six) of a rigid solid, whereas in cases where the freedom is\r\ngreater we have to invoke the aid of other supplementary physical\r\nhypotheses (cf. ELASTICITY; HYDROMECHANICS).\r\n\r\nThe increase of the kinetic energy of a rigid body in any interval of\r\ntime is equal to the work done by the extraneous forces acting on the\r\nbody. This is an immediate consequence of the fundamental postulate, in\r\neither of the forms above stated, since the internal forces do on the\r\nwhole no work. The statement may be extended to a system of rigid\r\nbodies, provided the mutual reactions consist of the stresses in\r\ninextensible links, or the pressures between smooth surfaces, or the\r\nreactions at rolling contacts (§ 9).\r\n\r\n§ 17. _Two-dimensional Problems._--In the case of rotation about a fixed\r\naxis, the principles take a very simple form. The position of the body\r\nis specified by a single co-ordinate, viz. the angle [theta] through\r\nwhich some plane passing through the axis and fixed in the body has\r\nturned from a standard position in space. Then d[theta]/dt, = [omega]\r\nsay, is the _angular velocity_ of the body. The angular momentum of a\r\nparticle m at a distance r from the axis is m[omega]r·r, and the total\r\nangular momentum is [Sigma](mr²)·[omega], or I[omega], if I denote the\r\nmoment of inertia (§ 11) about the axis. Hence if N be the moment of the\r\nextraneous forces about the axis, we have\r\n\r\n   d\r\n  --- (I[omega]) = N.  (1)\r\n  dt\r\n\r\nThis may be compared with the equation of rectilinear motion of a\r\nparticle, viz. d/dt·(Mu) = X; it shows that I measures the inertia of\r\nthe body as regards rotation, just as M measures its inertia as regards\r\ntranslation. If N = 0, [omega] is constant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.]\r\n\r\n  As a first example, suppose we have a flywheel free to rotate about a\r\n  horizontal axis, and that a weight m hangs by a vertical string from\r\n  the circumferences of an axle of radius b (fig. 72). Neglecting\r\n  frictional resistance we have, if R be the tension of the string,\r\n\r\n    I[.omega] = Rb, m[.u] = mg - R,\r\n\r\n  whence\r\n                  mb²\r\n    b[.omega] = -------  (2)\r\n                1 + mb²\r\n\r\n  This gives the acceleration of m as modified by the inertia of the\r\n  wheel.\r\n\r\n  A \"compound pendulum\" is a body of any form which is free to rotate\r\n  about a fixed horizontal axis, the only extraneous force (other than\r\n  the pressures of the axis) being that of gravity. If M be the total\r\n  mass, k the radius of gyration (§ 11) about the axis, we have\r\n\r\n     d   /    d[theta]\\\r\n    --- ( Mk² -------- )  = -Mgh sin [theta],  (3)\r\n    dt   \\       dt   /\r\n\r\n  where [theta] is the angle which the plane containing the axis and the\r\n  centre of gravity G makes with the vertical, and h is the distance of\r\n  G from the axis. This coincides with the equation of motion of a\r\n  simple pendulum [§ 13 (15)] of length l, provided l = k²/h. The plane\r\n  of the diagram (fig. 73) is supposed to be a plane through G\r\n  perpendicular to the axis, which it meets in O. If we produce OG to P,\r\n  making OP = l, the point P is called the _centre of oscillation_; the\r\n  bob of a simple pendulum of length OP suspended from O will keep step\r\n  with the motion of P, if properly started. If [kappa] be the radius of\r\n  gyration about a parallel axis through G, we have k² = [kappa]² + h²\r\n  by § 11 (16), and therefore l = h + [kappa]²/h, whence\r\n\r\n    GO·GP = [kappa]².  (4)\r\n\r\n  This shows that if the body were swung from a parallel axis through P\r\n  the new centre of oscillation would be at O. For different parallel\r\n  axes, the period of a small oscillation varies as [root]l, or\r\n  [root](GO + OP); this is least, subject to the condition (4), when GO\r\n  = GP = [kappa]. The reciprocal relation between the centres of\r\n  suspension and oscillation is the basis of Kater's method of\r\n  determining g experimentally. A pendulum is constructed with two\r\n  parallel knife-edges as nearly as possible in the same plane with G,\r\n  the position of one of them being adjustable. If it could be arranged\r\n  that the period of a small oscillation should be exactly the same\r\n  about either edge, the two knife-edges would in general occupy the\r\n  positions of conjugate centres of suspension and oscillation; and the\r\n  distances between them would be the length l of the equivalent simple\r\n  pendulum. For if h1 + [kappa]²/h1 = h2 + [kappa]²/h2, then unless h1 =\r\n  h2, we must have [kappa]² = h1h2, l = h1 + h2. Exact equality of the\r\n  two observed periods ([tau]1, [tau]2, say) cannot of course be secured\r\n  in practice, and a modification is necessary. If we write l1 = h1 +\r\n  [kappa]²/h1, l2 = h2 + [kappa]²/h2, we find, on elimination of\r\n  [kappa],\r\n\r\n      l1 + l2     l1 - l2\r\n    ½ ------- + ½ ------- = 1,\r\n      h1 + h2     h1 - h2\r\n\r\n  whence\r\n\r\n    4[pi]²   ½ ([tau]1² + [tau]2²)   ½ ([tau]1² - [tau]2²)\r\n    ------ = --------------------- + ---------------------  (5)\r\n      g             h1 + h2                  h1 - h2\r\n\r\n  The distance h1 + h2, which occurs in the first term on the right hand\r\n  can be measured directly. For the second term we require the values of\r\n  h1, h2 separately, but if [tau]1, [tau]2 are nearly equal whilst h1,\r\n  h2 are distinctly unequal this term will be relatively small, so that\r\n  an approximate knowledge of h1, h2 is sufficient.\r\n\r\n  As a final example we may note the arrangement, often employed in\r\n  physical measurements, where a body performs small oscillations about\r\n  a vertical axis through its mass-centre G, under the influence of a\r\n  couple whose moment varies as the angle of rotation from the\r\n  equilibrium position. The equation of motion is of the type\r\n\r\n    I[:theta] = -K[theta],  (6)\r\n\r\n  and the period is therefore [tau] = 2[pi][root](I/K). If by the\r\n  attachment of another body of known moment of inertia I´, the period\r\n  is altered from [tau] to [tau]´, we have [tau]´ = 2[pi][root][(I +\r\n  I´)/K]. We are thus enabled to determine both I and K, viz.\r\n\r\n    I/I´ = [tau]²/([tau]´² - [tau]²), K = 4[pi]²[tau]²I/([tau]´² - [tau]²).  (7)\r\n\r\n  The couple may be due to the earth's magnetism, or to the torsion of\r\n  a suspending wire, or to a \"bifilar\" suspension. In the latter case,\r\n  the body hangs by two vertical threads of equal length l in a plane\r\n  through G. The motion being assumed to be small, the tensions of the\r\n  two strings may be taken to have their statical values Mgb/(a + b),\r\n  Mga/(a + b), where a, b are the distances of G from the two threads.\r\n  When the body is twisted through an angle [theta] the threads make\r\n  angles a[theta]/l, b[theta]/l with the vertical, and the moment of the\r\n  tensions about the vertical through G is accordingly -K[theta], where\r\n  K = M gab/l.\r\n\r\nFor the determination of the motion it has only been necessary to use\r\none of the dynamical equations. The remaining equations serve to\r\ndetermine the reactions of the rotating body on its bearings. Suppose,\r\nfor example, that there are no extraneous forces. Take rectangular axes,\r\nof which Oz coincides with the axis of rotation. The angular velocity\r\nbeing constant, the effective force on a particle m at a distance r from\r\nOz is m[omega]²r towards this axis, and its components are accordingly\r\n-[omega]²mx, -[omega]²my, O. Since the reactions on the bearings must be\r\nstatically equivalent to the whole system of effective forces, they will\r\nreduce to a force (X Y Z) at O and a couple (L M N) given by\r\n\r\n  X = -[omega]²[Sigma](mx) = -[omega]²[Sigma](m)[|x], Y = -[omega]²[Sigma](my) = -[omega]²[Sigma](m)[|y], Z = 0,\r\n\r\n                         L = [omega]²[Sigma](myz), M = -[omega]²[Sigma](mzx), N = 0, (8)\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere [|x], [|y] refer to the mass-centre G. The reactions do not\r\ntherefore reduce to a single force at O unless [Sigma](myz) = 0,\r\n[Sigma](msx) = 0, i.e. unless the axis of rotation be a principal axis\r\nof inertia (§ 11) at O. In order that the force may vanish we must also\r\nhave x, y = 0, i.e. the mass-centre must lie in the axis of rotation.\r\nThese considerations are important in the \"balancing\" of machinery. We\r\nnote further that if a body be free to turn about a fixed point O, there\r\nare three mutually perpendicular lines through this point about which it\r\ncan rotate steadily, without further constraint. The theory of principal\r\nor \"permanent\" axes was first investigated from this point of view by J.\r\nA. Segner (1755). The origin of the name \"deviation moment\" sometimes\r\napplied to a product of inertia is also now apparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.]\r\n\r\nProceeding to the general motion of a rigid body in two dimensions we\r\nmay take as the three co-ordinates of the body the rectangular Cartesian\r\nco-ordinates x, y of the mass-centre G and the angle [theta] through\r\nwhich the body has turned from some standard position. The components of\r\nlinear momentum are then M[.x], M[.y], and the angular momentum relative\r\nto G as base is I[.theta], where M is the mass and I the moment of\r\ninertia about G. If the extraneous forces be reduced to a force (X, Y)\r\nat G and a couple N, we have\r\n\r\n  M[:x] = X, M[:y] = Y, I[:theta] = N.  (9)\r\n\r\nIf the extraneous forces have zero moment about G the angular velocity\r\n[.theta] is constant. Thus a circular disk projected under gravity in a\r\nvertical plane spins with constant angular velocity, whilst its centre\r\ndescribes a parabola.\r\n\r\n  We may apply the equations (9) to the case of a solid of revolution\r\n  rolling with its axis horizontal on a plane of inclination [alpha]. If\r\n  the axis of x be taken parallel to the slope of the plane, with x\r\n  increasing downwards, we have\r\n\r\n    M[:x] = Mg sin [alpha] - F, 0 = Mg cos [alpha] - R, M[kappa]²[:theta] = Fa  (10)\r\n\r\n  where [kappa] is the radius of gyration about the axis of symmetry, a\r\n  is the constant distance of G from the plane, and R, F are the normal\r\n  and tangential components of the reaction of the plane, as shown in\r\n  fig. 74. We have also the kinematical relation [.x] = a[.theta]. Hence\r\n\r\n                 a²                                                [kappa]²\r\n    [:x] = ------------- g sin [alpha], R = Mg cos [alpha], F = ------------- Mg sin [alpha].  (11)\r\n           [kappa]² + a²                                        [kappa]² + a²\r\n\r\n  The acceleration of G is therefore less than in the case of\r\n  frictionless sliding in the ratio a²/([kappa]² + a²). For a\r\n  homogeneous sphere this ratio is 5/7, for a uniform circular cylinder\r\n  or disk 2/3, for a circular hoop or a thin cylindrical shell ½.\r\n\r\nThe equation of energy for a rigid body has already been stated (in\r\neffect) as a corollary from fundamental assumptions. It may also be\r\ndeduced from the principles of linear and angular momentum as embodied\r\nin the equations (9). We have\r\n\r\n  M([.x][:x] + [.y][:]y) + l[.theta][:theta] + X[.x] + Y[.y] + N[.theta],  (12)\r\n\r\nwhence, integrating with respect to t,\r\n\r\n  ½ M([.x]² + [.y]²) + ½I[.theta]² = [int](X dx + Y dy + Nd[theta]) + const.  (13)\r\n\r\nThe left-hand side is the kinetic energy of the whole mass, supposed\r\nconcentrated at G and moving with this point, together with the kinetic\r\nenergy of the motion relative to G (§ 15); and the right-hand member\r\nrepresents the integral work done by the extraneous forces in the\r\nsuccessive infinitesimal displacements into which the motion may be\r\nresolved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.]\r\n\r\n  The formula (13) may be easily verified in the case of the compound\r\n  pendulum, or of the solid rolling down an incline. As another example,\r\n  suppose we have a circular cylinder whose mass-centre is at an\r\n  excentric point, rolling on a horizontal plane. This includes the case\r\n  of a compound pendulum in which the knife-edge is replaced by a\r\n  cylindrical pin. If [alpha] be the radius of the cylinder, h the\r\n  distance of G from its axis (O), [kappa] the radius of gyration about\r\n  a longitudinal axis through G, and [theta] the inclination of OG to\r\n  the vertical, the kinetic energy is 1/2M[kappa]²[.theta]² +\r\n  ½M·CG²·[.theta]², by § 3, since the body is turning about the line of\r\n  contact (C) as instantaneous axis, and the potential energy is--Mgh\r\n  cos [theta]. The equation of energy is therefore\r\n\r\n    ½ M([kappa]² + [alpha]² + h² - 2 ah cos [theta]) [.theta]² - Mgh cos [theta] - const.  (14)\r\n\r\nWhenever, as in the preceding examples, a body or a system of bodies, is\r\nsubject to constraints which leave it virtually only one degree of\r\nfreedom, the equation of energy is sufficient for the complete\r\ndetermination of the motion. If q be any variable co-ordinate defining\r\nthe position or (in the case of a system of bodies) the configuration,\r\nthe velocity of each particle at any instant will be proportional to\r\n[.q], and the total kinetic energy may be expressed in the form ½A[.q]²,\r\nwhere A is in general a function of q [cf. equation (14)]. This\r\ncoefficient A is called the coefficient of inertia, or the reduced\r\ninertia of the system, referred to the co-ordinate q.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.]\r\n\r\n  Thus in the case of a railway truck travelling with velocity u the\r\n  kinetic energy is ½(M + m[kappa]²/[alpha]²)u², where M is the total\r\n  mass, [alpha] the radius and [kappa] the radius of gyration of each\r\n  wheel, and m is the sum of the masses of the wheels; the reduced\r\n  inertia is therefore M + m[kappa]²/[alpha]². Again, take the system\r\n  composed of the flywheel, connecting rod, and piston of a\r\n  steam-engine. We have here a limiting case of three-bar motion (§ 3),\r\n  and the instantaneous centre J of the connecting-rod PQ will have the\r\n  position shown in the figure. The velocities of P and Q will be in the\r\n  ratio of JP to JQ, or OR to OQ; the velocity of the piston is\r\n  therefore y[.theta], where y = OR. Hence if, for simplicity, we\r\n  neglect the inertia of the connecting-rod, the kinetic energy will be\r\n  ½(I + My²)[.theta]², where I is the moment of inertia of the flywheel,\r\n  and M is the mass of the piston. The effect of the mass of the piston\r\n  is therefore to increase the apparent moment of inertia of the\r\n  flywheel by the variable amount My². If, on the other hand, we take OP\r\n  (= x) as our variable, the kinetic energy is 1/2(M + I/y²)[.x]². We\r\n  may also say, therefore, that the effect of the flywheel is to\r\n  increase the apparent mass of the piston by the amount I/y²; this\r\n  becomes infinite at the \"dead-points\" where the crank is in line with\r\n  the connecting-rod.\r\n\r\nIf the system be \"conservative,\" we have\r\n\r\n  ½ Aq² + V = const.,  (15)\r\n\r\nwhere V is the potential energy. If we differentiate this with respect\r\nto t, and divide out by [.q], we obtain\r\n\r\n            dA      dV\r\n  A[:q] + ½ -- q² + -- = 0  (16)\r\n            dq      dq\r\n\r\nas the equation of motion of the system with the unknown reactions (if\r\nany) eliminated. For equilibrium this must be satisfied by [.q] = O;\r\nthis requires that dV/dq = 0, i.e. the potential energy must be\r\n\"stationary.\" To examine the effect of a small disturbance from\r\nequilibrium we put V = f(q), and write q = q0 + [eta], where q0 is a\r\nroot of f´(q0) = 0 and [eta] is small. Neglecting terms of the second\r\norder in [eta] we have dV/dq = f´(q) = f´´(q0)·[eta], and the equation\r\n(16) reduces to\r\n\r\n  A[:eta] + f´´(q0)[eta] = 0,  (17)\r\n\r\nwhere A may be supposed to be constant and to have the value\r\ncorresponding to q = q0. Hence if f´´(q0) > 0, i.e. if V is a minimum in\r\nthe configuration of equilibrium, the variation of [eta] is\r\nsimple-harmonic, and the period is 2[pi][root][A/f´´(q0)]. This depends\r\nonly on the constitution of the system, whereas the amplitude and epoch\r\nwill vary with the initial circumstances. If f´´(q0) < 0, the solution\r\nof (17) will involve real exponentials, and [eta] will in general\r\nincrease until the neglect of the terms of the second order is no longer\r\njustified. The configuration q = q0, is then unstable.\r\n\r\n  As an example of the method, we may take the problem to which equation\r\n  (14) relates. If we differentiate, and divide by [theta], and retain\r\n  only the terms of the first order in [theta], we obtain\r\n\r\n    {x² + (h - [alpha])²} [:theta] + gh[theta] = 0,  (18)\r\n\r\n  as the equation of small oscillations about the position [theta] = 0.\r\n  The length of the equivalent simple pendulum is {[kappa]² + (h -\r\n  [alpha])²}/h.\r\n\r\nThe equations which express the change of motion (in two dimensions) due\r\nto an instantaneous impulse are of the forms\r\n\r\n  M(u´- u) = [xi], M([nu]´ - [nu]) = [eta], I([omega]´ - [omega]) = [nu].  (19)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.]\r\n\r\nHere u´, [nu]´ are the values of the component velocities of G just\r\nbefore, and u, [nu] their values just after, the impulse, whilst\r\n[omega]´, [omega] denote the corresponding angular velocities. Further,\r\n[xi], [eta] are the time-integrals of the forces parallel to the\r\nco-ordinate axes, and [nu] is the time-integral of their moment about G.\r\nSuppose, for example, that a rigid lamina at rest, but free to move, is\r\nstruck by an instantaneous impulse F in a given line. Evidently G will\r\nbegin to move parallel to the line of F; let its initial velocity be u´,\r\nand let [omega]´ be the initial angular velocity. Then Mu´ = F,\r\nI[omega]´ = F·GP, where GP is the perpendicular from G to the line of F.\r\nIf PG be produced to any point C, the initial velocity of the point C of\r\nthe lamina will be\r\n\r\n  u´ - [omega]´·GC = (F/M)·(I - GC·CP/[kappa]²),\r\n\r\nwhere [kappa]² is the radius of gyration about G. The initial centre of\r\nrotation will therefore be at C, provided GC·GP = [kappa]². If this\r\ncondition be satisfied there would be no impulsive reaction at C even if\r\nthis point were fixed. The point P is therefore called the _centre of\r\npercussion_ for the axis at C. It will be noted that the relation\r\nbetween C and P is the same as that which connects the centres of\r\nsuspension and oscillation in the compound pendulum.\r\n\r\n§ 18. _Equations of Motion in Three Dimensions._--It was proved in § 7\r\nthat a body moving about a fixed point O can be brought from its\r\nposition at time t to its position at time t + [delta]t by an\r\ninfinitesimal rotation [epsilon] about some axis through O; and the\r\nlimiting position of this axis, when [delta]t is infinitely small, was\r\ncalled the \"instantaneous axis.\" The limiting value of the ratio\r\n[epsilon]/[delta]t is called the _angular velocity_ of the body; we\r\ndenote it by [omega]. If [xi], [eta], [zeta] are the components of\r\n[epsilon] about rectangular co-ordinate axes through O, the limiting\r\nvalues of [xi]/[delta]t, [eta]/[delta]t, [zeta]/[delta]t are called the\r\n_component angular velocities_; we denote them by p, q, r. If l, m, n be\r\nthe direction-cosines of the instantaneous axis we have\r\n\r\n  p = l[omega], q = m[omega], r = n[omega],  (1)\r\n  p² + q² + r² = [omega]².  (2)\r\n\r\nIf we draw a vector OJ to represent the angular velocity, then J traces\r\nout a certain curve in the body, called the _polhode_, and a certain\r\ncurve in space, called the _herpolhode_. The cones generated by the\r\ninstantaneous axis in the body and in space are called the polhode and\r\nherpolhode cones, respectively; in the actual motion the former cone\r\nrolls on the latter (§ 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.]\r\n\r\n  The special case where both cones are right circular and [omega] is\r\n  constant is important in astronomy and also in mechanism (theory of\r\n  bevel wheels). The \"precession of the equinoxes\" is due to the fact\r\n  that the earth performs a motion of this kind about its centre, and\r\n  the whole class of such motions has therefore been termed\r\n  _precessional_. In fig. 78, which shows the various cases, OZ is the\r\n  axis of the fixed and OC that of the rolling cone, and J is the point\r\n  of contact of the polhode and herpolhode, which are of course both\r\n  circles. If [alpha]be the semi-angle of the rolling cone, [beta] the\r\n  constant inclination of OC to OZ, and [.psi] the angular velocity with\r\n  which the plane ZOC revolves about OZ, then, considering the velocity\r\n  of a point in OC at unit distance from O, we have\r\n\r\n    [omega] sin [alpha] = ±[.psi] sin [beta],  (3)\r\n\r\n  where the lower sign belongs to the third case. The earth's\r\n  precessional motion is of this latter type, the angles being [alpha] =\r\n  .0087´´, [beta] = 23° 28´.\r\n\r\nIf m be the mass of a particle at P, and PN the perpendicular to the\r\ninstantaneous axis, the kinetic energy T is given by\r\n\r\n  2T = [Sigma] {m([omega]·PN)²} = [omega]²·[Sigma](m·PN²) = I[omega]²,  (4)\r\n\r\nwhere I is the moment of inertia about the instantaneous axis. With the\r\nsame notation for moments and products of inertia as in § 11 (38), we\r\nhave\r\n\r\n  I = Al² + Bm² + Cn² - 2Fmn - 2Gnl - 2Hlm,\r\n\r\nand therefore by (1),\r\n\r\n  2T = Ap² + Bq² + Cr² - 2Fqr - 2Grp - 2Hpq.  (5)\r\n\r\nAgain, if x, y, z be the co-ordinates of P, the component velocities of\r\nm are\r\n\r\n  qz - ry, rx - pz, py - qx,  (6)\r\n\r\nby § 7 (5); hence, if [lambda], [mu], [nu] be now used to denote the\r\ncomponent angular momenta about the co-ordinate axes, we have [lambda] =\r\n[Sigma][m(py - qx)y - m(rx - pz)z], with two similar formulae, or\r\n\r\n                           [dP]T  \\\r\n  [lambda] = Ap - Hq - Gr= -----,  |\r\n                           [dP]p   |\r\n                                   |\r\n                         [dP]T     |\r\n  [mu] = -Hp + Bq - Fr = -----,     >  (7)\r\n                         [dP]q     |\r\n                                   |\r\n                         [dP]T     |\r\n  [nu] = -Gp - Fq + Cr = -----.    |\r\n                         [dP]r    /\r\n\r\nIf the co-ordinate axes be taken to coincide with the principal axes of\r\ninertia at O, at the instant under consideration, we have the simpler\r\nformulae\r\n\r\n  2T = Ap² + Bq² + Cr²,  (8)\r\n\r\n  [lambda] = Ap, [mu] = Bq, [nu] = Cr.  (9)\r\n\r\nIt is to be carefully noticed that the axis of resultant angular\r\nmomentum about O does not in general coincide with the instantaneous\r\naxis of rotation. The relation between these axes may be expressed by\r\nmeans of the momental ellipsoid at O. The equation of the latter,\r\nreferred to its principal axes, being as in § 11 (41), the co-ordinates\r\nof the point J where it is met by the instantaneous axis are\r\nproportional to p, q, r, and the direction-cosines of the normal at J\r\nare therefore proportional to Ap, Bq, Cr, or [lambda], [mu], [nu]. The\r\naxis of resultant angular momentum is therefore normal to the tangent\r\nplane at J, and does not coincide with OJ unless the latter be a\r\nprincipal axis. Again, if [Gamma] be the resultant angular momentum, so\r\nthat\r\n\r\n  [lambda]² + [mu]² + [nu]² = [Gamma]²,  (10)\r\n\r\nthe length of the perpendicular OH on the tangent plane at J is\r\n\r\n         Ap         p             Bq         q             Cr         r             2T       [rho]\r\n  OH = ------- · -------[rho] + ------- · -------[rho] + ------- · -------[rho] = ------- · -------,  (11)\r\n       [Gamma]   [omega]        [Gamma]   [omega]        [Gamma]   [omega]        [Gamma]   [omega]\r\n\r\nwhere [rho] = OJ. This relation will be of use to us presently (§ 19).\r\n\r\nThe motion of a rigid body in the most general case may be specified by\r\nmeans of the component velocities u, v, w of any point O of it which is\r\ntaken as base, and the component angular velocities p, q, r. The\r\ncomponent velocities of any point whose co-ordinates relative to O are\r\nx, y, z are then\r\n\r\n  u + qz - ry, v + rx - pz, w + py - qx  (12)\r\n\r\nby § 7 (6). It is usually convenient to take as our base-point the\r\nmass-centre of the body. In this case the kinetic energy is given by\r\n\r\n  2T = M0(u² + v² + w²) + Ap² + Bq² + Cr² - 2Fqr - 2Grp - 2Hpg,  (13)\r\n\r\nwhere M0 is the mass, and A, B, C, F, G, H are the moments and products\r\nof inertia with respect to the mass-centre; cf. § 15 (9).\r\n\r\nThe components [xi], [eta], [zeta] of linear momentum are\r\n\r\n               [dP]T                [dP]T                 [dP]T\r\n  [xi] = M0u = -----, [eta] = M0v = -----, [zeta] = M0w = -----,  (14)\r\n               [dP]u                [dP]v                 [dP]w\r\n\r\nwhilst those of the relative angular momentum are given by (7). The\r\npreceding formulae are sufficient for the treatment of instantaneous\r\nimpulses. Thus if an impulse ([xi], [eta], [zeta], [lambda], [mu], [nu])\r\nchange the motion from (u, v, w, p, q, r) to (u´, v´, w´, p´, q´, r´) we\r\nhave\r\n\r\n  M0(u´- u) = [xi], M0(v´- v) = [eta], M0(w´- w) = [zeta], \\\r\n                                                            >  (15)\r\n  A(p´ - p) = [lambda], B(q´- q) = [mu], C(r´- r) = [nu],  /\r\n\r\nwhere, for simplicity, the co-ordinate axes are supposed to coincide\r\nwith the principal axes at the mass-centre. Hence the change of kinetic\r\nenergy is\r\n\r\n  T´- T = [xi] · ½(u + u´) + [eta] · ½(v + v´) + [zeta] · ½(w + w´),\r\n        + [lambda] · ½(p + p´) + [mu] · ½(q + q´) + [nu] · ½(r + r´).  (16)\r\n\r\nThe factors of [xi], [eta], [zeta], [lambda], [mu], [nu] on the\r\nright-hand side are proportional to the constituents of a possible\r\ninfinitesimal displacement of the solid, and the whole expression is\r\nproportional (on the same scale) to the work done by the given system of\r\nimpulsive forces in such a displacement. As in § 9 this must be equal to\r\nthe total work done in such a displacement by the several forces,\r\nwhatever they are, which make up the impulse. We are thus led to the\r\nfollowing statement: the change of kinetic energy due to any system of\r\nimpulsive forces is equal to the sum of the products of the several\r\nforces into the semi-sum of the initial and final velocities of their\r\nrespective points of application, resolved in the directions of the\r\nforces. Thus in the problem of fig. 77 the kinetic energy generated is\r\n½M([kappa]² + Cq²)[omega]´², if C be the instantaneous centre; this is\r\nseen to be equal to ½F·[omega]´·CP, where [omega]´·CP represents the\r\ninitial velocity of P.\r\n\r\nThe equations of continuous motion of a solid are obtained by\r\nsubstituting the values of [xi], [eta], [zeta], [lambda], [mu], [nu]\r\nfrom (14) and (7) in the general equations\r\n\r\n  d[xi]      d[eta]      d[zeta]        \\\r\n  ----- = X, ------ = Y, ------- = Z,   |\r\n   dt         dt           dt           |\r\n                                         >  (17)\r\n  d[lambda]      d[mu]       d[nu]      |\r\n  --------- = L, ----- = M,  ----- = N, |\r\n      dt           dt         dt        /\r\n\r\nwhere (X, Y, Z, L, M, N) denotes the system of extraneous forces\r\nreferred (like the momenta) to the mass-centre as base, the co-ordinate\r\naxes being of course fixed in direction. The resulting equations are not\r\nas a rule easy of application, owing to the fact that the moments and\r\nproducts of inertia A, B, C, F, G, H are not constants but vary in\r\nconsequence of the changing orientation of the body with respect to the\r\nco-ordinate axes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.]\r\n\r\n  An exception occurs, however, in the case of a solid which is\r\n  kinetically symmetrical (§ 11) about the mass-centre, e.g. a uniform\r\n  sphere. The equations then take the forms\r\n\r\n    M0[.u] = X, M0[.v] = Y, M0[.w] = Z,\r\n    C[.p] = L, C[.q] = M, C[.r] = N,  (18)\r\n\r\n  where C is the constant moment of inertia about any axis through the\r\n  mass-centre. Take, for example, the case of a sphere rolling on a\r\n  plane; and let the axes Ox, Oy be drawn through the centre parallel to\r\n  the plane, so that the equation of the latter is z = -a. We will\r\n  suppose that the extraneous forces consist of a known force (X, Y, Z)\r\n  at the centre, and of the reactions (F1, F2, R) at the point of\r\n  contact. Hence\r\n\r\n    M0[.u] = X + F1, M0[.v] = Y + F2, 0 = Z + R,  \\\r\n     C[.p] = F2a, C[.q] = -F1a, C[.r] = 0.        /  (19)\r\n\r\n  The last equation shows that the angular velocity about the normal to\r\n  the plane is constant. Again, since the point of the sphere which is\r\n  in contact with the plane is instantaneously at rest, we have the\r\n  geometrical relations\r\n\r\n    u + qa = 0, v + pa = 0, w = 0,  (20)\r\n\r\n  by (12). Eliminating p, q, we get\r\n\r\n    (M0 + Ca^-2)[.u] = X, (M0 + Ca^-2)[.v] = Y.  (21)\r\n\r\n  The acceleration of the centre is therefore the same as if the plane\r\n  were smooth and the mass of the sphere were increased by C/[alpha]².\r\n  Thus the centre of a sphere rolling under gravity on a plane of\r\n  inclination a describes a parabola with an acceleration\r\n\r\n    g sin [alpha]/(1 + C/Ma²)\r\n\r\n  parallel to the lines of greatest slope.\r\n\r\n  Take next the case of a sphere rolling on a fixed spherical surface.\r\n  Let a be the radius of the rolling sphere, c that of the spherical\r\n  surface which is the locus of its centre, and let x, y, z be the\r\n  co-ordinates of this centre relative to axes through O, the centre of\r\n  the fixed sphere. If the only extraneous forces are the reactions (P,\r\n  Q, R) at the point of contact, we have\r\n\r\n    M0[:x] = P, M0[.y] = Q, M0[:z] = R,                            \\\r\n                                                                   |\r\n          a                     a                     a             >  (22)\r\n    Cp = ---(yR - zQ), C[.q] = ---(zP - xR), C[.r] = ---(xQ - yP), |\r\n          c                     c                     c            /\r\n\r\n  the standard case being that where the rolling sphere is outside the\r\n  fixed surface. The opposite case is obtained by reversing the sign of\r\n  a. We have also the geometrical relations\r\n\r\n    [.x] = (a/c)(qz - ry), [.y] = (a/c)(rx - pz), [.z] = (a/c)(py - gx),  (23)\r\n\r\n  If we eliminate P, Q, R from (22), the resulting equations are\r\n  integrable with respect to t; thus\r\n\r\n          M0a                                 M0a\r\n    p = - ---(y[.z] - z[.y]) + [alpha], q = - ---(z[.x] - x[.z]) + [beta],\r\n          Cc                                  Cc\r\n\r\n          M0a\r\n    r = - ---(x[.y] - y[.x]) + [gamma],  (24)\r\n          Cc\r\n\r\n  where [alpha], [beta], [gamma] are arbitrary constants. Substituting\r\n  in (23) we find\r\n\r\n     /    M0a²\\         a                        /    M0a²\\         a\r\n    ( 1 + ---- )[.x] = ---([beta]z - [gamma]y), ( 1 + ---- )[.y] = ---([gamma]x - [alpha]z),\r\n     \\     C  /         c                        \\     C  /         c\r\n\r\n     /    M0a²\\         a\r\n    ( 1 + ---- )[.z] = ---([alpha]y - [beta]x).

As an example of this latter type, suppose that a\r\n  sphere is placed on the highest point of a fixed sphere and set\r\n  spinning about the vertical diameter with the angular velocity n; it\r\n  will appear that under a certain condition the motion of G consequent\r\n  on a slight disturbance will be oscillatory. If Oz be drawn vertically\r\n  upwards, then in the beginning of the disturbed motion the quantities\r\n  x, y, p, q, P, Q will all be small. Hence, omitting terms of the\r\n  second order, we find\r\n\r\n    M0[:x] = P, M0[.y] = Q, R = M0g,                              \\\r\n                                                                   >  (30)\r\n    C[.p] = -(M0ga/c)y + aQ, C[.q] = (M0ga/c)x - aP, C[.r] = 0.   /\r\n\r\n  The last equation shows that the component r of the angular velocity\r\n  retains (to the first order) the constant value n. The geometrical\r\n  relations reduce to\r\n\r\n    [.x] = aq - (na/c)y, [.y] = -ap + (na/c)x.  (31)\r\n\r\n  Eliminating p, g, P, Q, we obtain the equations\r\n\r\n  (C + M0a²)[:x] + (Cna/c)y - (M0ga²/c)x = 0,     }\r\n  (C + M0a²)[:y] - (Cna/c)x - (M0ga²/c)y = 0,     }          (32)\r\n\r\n  which are both contained in\r\n     _                                _\r\n    |          d²      Cna  d    M0ga² |\r\n    |(C + M0a²)--- - i --- --- - ----- | (x + iy) = 0.  (33)\r\n    |_         dt²      c  dt      c  _|\r\n\r\n\r\n  This has two solutions of the type x + iy = [alpha]e^{i([sigma]t +\r\n  [epsilon])}, where [alpha], [epsilon] are arbitrary, and [sigma] is a\r\n  root of the quadratic\r\n\r\n    (C + M0a²)[sigma]² - (Cna/c)[sigma] + M0ga²/c = 0.  (34)\r\n\r\n  If\r\n\r\n    n² > (4Mgc/C) (1 + M0a²/C),  (35)\r\n\r\n  both roots are real, and have the same sign as n. The motion of G then\r\n  consists of two superposed circular vibrations of the type\r\n\r\n    x = [alpha] cos ([sigma]t + [epsilon]), y = [alpha] sin ([sigma]t + [epsilon]),  (36)\r\n\r\n  in each of which the direction of revolution is the same as that of\r\n  the initial spin of the sphere. It follows therefore that the original\r\n  position is stable provided the spin n exceed the limit defined by\r\n  (35). The case of a sphere spinning about a vertical axis at the\r\n  lowest point of a spherical bowl is obtained by reversing the signs of\r\n  [alpha] and c. It appears that this position is always stable.\r\n\r\n  It is to be remarked, however, that in the first form of the problem\r\n  the stability above investigated is practically of a limited or\r\n  temporary kind. The slightest frictional forces--such as the\r\n  resistance of the air--even if they act in lines through the centre of\r\n  the rolling sphere, and so do not directly affect its angular\r\n  momentum, will cause the centre gradually to descend in an\r\n  ever-widening spiral path.\r\n\r\n§ 19. _Free Motion of a Solid._--Before proceeding to further problems\r\nof motion under extraneous forces it is convenient to investigate the\r\nfree motion of a solid relative to its mass-centre O, in the most\r\ngeneral case. This is the same as the motion about a fixed point under\r\nthe action of extraneous forces which have zero moment about that point.\r\nThe question was first discussed by Euler (1750); the geometrical\r\nrepresentation to be given is due to Poinsot (1851).\r\n\r\nThe kinetic energy T of the motion relative to O will be constant. Now T\r\n= ½I[omega]², where [omega] is the angular velocity and I is the moment\r\nof inertia about the instantaneous axis. If [rho] be the radius-vector\r\nOJ of the momental ellipsoid\r\n\r\n  Ax² + By² + Cz² = M[epsilon]^4  (1)\r\n\r\ndrawn in the direction of the instantaneous axis, we have I =\r\nM[epsilon]^4/[rho]² (§ 11); hence [omega] varies as [rho]. The locus of\r\nJ may therefore be taken as the \"polhode\" (§ 18). Again, the vector\r\nwhich represents the angular momentum with respect to O will be constant\r\nin every respect. We have seen (§ 18) that this vector coincides in\r\ndirection with the perpendicular OH to the tangent plane of the momental\r\nellipsoid at J; also that\r\n\r\n         2T       [rho]\r\n  OH = ------- · -------,  (2)\r\n       [Gamma]   [omega]\r\n\r\nwhere [Gamma] is the resultant angular momentum about O. Since [omega]\r\nvaries as [rho], it follows that OH is constant, and the tangent plane\r\nat J is therefore fixed in space. The motion of the body relative to O\r\nis therefore completely represented if we imagine the momental ellipsoid\r\nat O to roll without sliding on a plane fixed in space, with an angular\r\nvelocity proportional at each instant to the radius-vector of the point\r\nof contact. The fixed plane is parallel to the invariable plane at O,\r\nand the line OH is called the _invariable line_. The trace of the point\r\nof contact J on the fixed plane is the \"herpolhode.\"\r\n\r\nIf p, q, r be the component angular velocities about the principal axes\r\nat O, we have\r\n\r\n  (A²p² + B²q² + C²r²)/[Gamma]² = (Ap² + Bq² + Cr²)/2T,  (3)\r\n\r\neach side being in fact equal to unity. At a point on the polhode cone x\r\n: y : z = p : q : r, and the equation of this cone is therefore\r\n\r\n     /    [Gamma]²\\         /    [Gamma]²\\         /    [Gamma]²\\\r\n  A²( 1 - -------- )x² + B²( 1 - -------- )y² + C²( 1 - -------- )z² = 0.  (4)\r\n     \\       2AT  /         \\       2BT  /         \\       2CT  /\r\n\r\nSince 2AT - [Gamma]² = B (A - B)q² + C(A - C)r², it appears that if A >\r\nB > C the coefficient of x² in (4) is positive, that of z² is negative,\r\nwhilst that of y² is positive or negative according as 2BT <> [Gamma]².\r\nHence the polhode cone surrounds the axis of greatest or least moment\r\naccording as 2BT <> [Gamma]². In the critical case of 2BT = [Gamma]² it\r\nbreaks up into two planes through the axis of mean moment (Oy). The\r\nherpolhode curve in the fixed plane is obviously confined between two\r\nconcentric circles which it alternately touches; it is not in general a\r\nre-entrant curve. It has been shown by De Sparre that, owing to the\r\nlimitation imposed on the possible forms of the momental ellipsoid by\r\nthe relation B + C > A, the curve has no points of inflexion. The\r\ninvariable line OH describes another cone in the body, called the\r\n_invariable cone_. At any point of this we have x : y : z = Ap. Bq : Cr,\r\nand the equation is therefore\r\n\r\n   /    [Gamma]²\\       /    [Gamma]²\\       /    [Gamma]²\\\r\n  ( 1 - -------- )x² + ( 1 - -------- )y² + ( 1 - -------- )z² = 0.  (5)\r\n   \\       2AT  /       \\       2BT  /       \\       2CT  /\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.]\r\n\r\nThe signs of the coefficients follow the same rule as in the case of\r\n(4). The possible forms of the invariable cone are indicated in fig. 80\r\nby means of the intersections with a concentric spherical surface. In\r\nthe critical case of 2BT = [Gamma]² the cone degenerates into two\r\nplanes. It appears that if the body be sightly disturbed from a state of\r\nrotation about the principal axis of greatest or least moment, the\r\ninvariable cone will closely surround this axis, which will therefore\r\nnever deviate far from the invariable line. If, on the other hand, the\r\nbody be slightly disturbed from a state of rotation about the mean axis\r\na wide deviation will take place. Hence a rotation about the axis of\r\ngreatest or least moment is reckoned as stable, a rotation about the\r\nmean axis as unstable. The question is greatly simplified when two of\r\nthe principal moments are equal, say A = B. The polhode and herpolhode\r\ncones are then right circular, and the motion is \"precessional\"\r\naccording to the definition of § 18. If [alpha] be the inclination of\r\nthe instantaneous axis to the axis of symmetry, [beta] the inclination\r\nof the latter axis to the invariable line, we have\r\n\r\n  [Gamma] cos [beta] = C [omega] cos [alpha], [Gamma] sin [beta] = A [omega] sin [alpha],  (6)\r\n\r\nwhence\r\n\r\n                A\r\n  tan [beta] = --- tan [alpha].  (7)\r\n                C\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.]\r\n\r\nHence [beta] <> [alpha], and the circumstances are therefore those of\r\nthe first or second case in fig. 78, according as A <> C. If [psi] be\r\nthe rate at which the plane HOJ revolves about OH, we have\r\n\r\n          sin [alpha]           C cos [alpha]\r\n  [psi] = ----------- [omega] = ------------- [omega],  (8)\r\n          sin [beta]            A cos [beta]\r\n\r\nby § 18 (3). Also if [.chi] be the rate at which J describes the\r\npolhode, we have [.psi] sin ([beta]-[alpha]) = [.chi] sin [beta], whence\r\n\r\n           sin([alpha] - [beta])\r\n  [.chi] = --------------------- [omega].  (9)\r\n                 sin[alpha]\r\n\r\nIf the instantaneous axis only deviate slightly from the axis of\r\nsymmetry the angles [alpha], [beta] are small, and [.chi] = (A -\r\nC)A·[omega]; the instantaneous axis therefore completes its revolution\r\nin the body in the period\r\n\r\n   2[pi]   A - C\r\n  ------ = ----- [omega].  (10)\r\n  [.chi]     A\r\n\r\n  In the case of the earth it is inferred from the independent\r\n  phenomenon of luni-solar precession that (C - A)/A = .00313. Hence if\r\n  the earth's axis of rotation deviates slightly from the axis of\r\n  figure, it should describe a cone about the latter in 320 sidereal\r\n  days. This would cause a periodic variation in the latitude of any\r\n  place on the earth's surface, as determined by astronomical methods.\r\n  There appears to be evidence of a slight periodic variation of\r\n  latitude, but the period would seem to be about fourteen months. The\r\n  discrepancy is attributed to a defect of rigidity in the earth. The\r\n  phenomenon is known as the _Eulerian nutation_, since it is supposed\r\n  to come under the free rotations first discussed by Euler.\r\n\r\n§ 20. _Motion of a Solid of Revolution._--In the case of a solid of\r\nrevolution, or (more generally) whenever there is kinetic symmetry about\r\nan axis through the mass-centre, or through a fixed point O, a number\r\nof interesting problems can be treated almost directly from first\r\nprinciples. It frequently happens that the extraneous forces have zero\r\nmoment about the axis of symmetry, as e.g. in the case of the flywheel\r\nof a gyroscope if we neglect the friction at the bearings. The angular\r\nvelocity (r) about this axis is then constant. For we have seen that r\r\nis constant when there are no extraneous forces; and r is evidently not\r\naffected by an instantaneous impulse which leaves the angular momentum\r\nCr, about the axis of symmetry, unaltered. And a continuous force may be\r\nregarded as the limit of a succession of infinitesimal instantaneous\r\nimpulses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.]\r\n\r\n  Suppose, for example, that a flywheel is rotating with angular\r\n  velocity n about its axis, which is (say) horizontal, and that this\r\n  axis is made to rotate with the angular velocity [psi] in the\r\n  horizontal plane. The components of angular momentum about the axis of\r\n  the flywheel and about the vertical will be Cn and A [psi]\r\n  respectively, where A is the moment of inertia about any axis through\r\n  the mass-centre (or through the fixed point O) perpendicular to that\r\n  of symmetry. If [->OK] be the vector representing the former component\r\n  at time t, the vector which represents it at time t + [delta]t will be\r\n  [->OK´], equal to [->OK] in magnitude and making with it an angle\r\n  [delta][psi]. Hence [->KK´] ( = Cn [delta][psi]) will represent the\r\n  change in this component due to the extraneous forces. Hence, so far\r\n  as this component is concerned, the extraneous forces must supply a\r\n  couple of moment Cn[.psi] in a vertical plane through the axis of the\r\n  flywheel. If this couple be absent, the axis will be tilted out of the\r\n  horizontal plane in such a sense that the direction of the spin n\r\n  approximates to that of the azimuthal rotation [.psi]. The remaining\r\n  constituent of the extraneous forces is a couple A[:psi] about the\r\n  vertical; this vanishes if [.psi] is constant. If the axis of the\r\n  flywheel make an angle [theta] with the vertical, it is seen in like\r\n  manner that the required couple in the vertical plane through the axis\r\n  is Cn sin [theta] [.psi]. This matter can be strikingly illustrated\r\n  with an ordinary gyroscope, e.g. by making the larger movable ring in\r\n  fig. 37 rotate about its vertical diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.]\r\n\r\nIf the direction of the axis of kinetic symmetry be specified by means\r\nof the angular co-ordinates [theta], [psi] of § 7, then considering the\r\ncomponent velocities of the point C in fig. 83, which are [.theta] and\r\nsin [theta][.psi] along and perpendicular to the meridian ZC, we see\r\nthat the component angular velocities about the lines OA´, OB´ are -sin\r\n[theta] [.psi] and [.theta] respectively. Hence if the principal moments\r\nof inertia at O be A, A, C, and if n be the constant angular velocity\r\nabout the axis OC, the kinetic energy is given by\r\n\r\n  2T = A ([.theta]² + sin² [theta][.psi]²) + Cn².  (1)\r\n\r\nAgain, the components of angular momentum about OC, OA´ are Cn, -A sin\r\n[theta] [.psi], and therefore the angular momentum ([mu], say) about OZ\r\nis\r\n\r\n  [mu] = A sin² [theta][.psi] + Cn cos [theta].  (2)\r\n\r\nWe can hence deduce the condition of steady precessional motion in a\r\ntop. A solid of revolution is supposed to be free to turn about a fixed\r\npoint O on its axis of symmetry, its mass-centre G being in this axis at\r\na distance h from O. In fig. 83 OZ is supposed to be vertical, and OC is\r\nthe axis of the solid drawn in the direction OG. If [theta] is constant\r\nthe points C, A´ will in time [delta]t come to positions C´´, A´´ such\r\nthat CC´´ = sin [theta] [delta][psi], A´A´´ = cos [theta] [delta][psi],\r\nand the angular momentum about OB´ will become Cn sin [theta]\r\n[delta][psi] - A sin [theta] [.psi] · cos [theta] [delta][psi]. Equating\r\nthis to Mgh sin [theta] [delta]t, and dividing out by sin [theta], we\r\nobtain\r\n\r\n  A cos [theta] [.psi]² - Cn[.psi] + Mgh = 0,  (3)\r\n\r\nas the condition in question. For given values of n and [theta] we have\r\ntwo possible values of [.psi] provided n exceed a certain limit. With a\r\nvery rapid spin, or (more precisely) with Cn large in comparison with\r\n[root](4AMgh cos [theta]), one value of [.psi] is small and the other\r\nlarge, viz. the two values are Mgh/Cn and Cn/A cos [theta]\r\napproximately. The absence of g from the latter expression indicates\r\nthat the circumstances of the rapid precession are very nearly those of\r\na free Eulerian rotation (§ 19), gravity playing only a subordinate\r\npart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.]\r\n\r\n  Again, take the case of a circular disk rolling in steady motion on a\r\n  horizontal plane. The centre O of the disk is supposed to describe a\r\n  horizontal circle of radius c with the constant angular velocity\r\n  [.psi], whilst its plane preserves a constant inclination [theta] to\r\n  the horizontal. The components of the reaction of the horizontal lane\r\n  will be Mc[.psi]² at right angles to the tangent line at the point of\r\n  contact and Mg vertically upwards, and the moment of these about the\r\n  horizontal diameter of the disk, which corresponds to OB´ in fig. 83,\r\n  is Mc[.psi]². [alpha] sin [theta] - Mg[alpha] cos [theta], where\r\n  [alpha] is the radius of the disk. Equating this to the rate of\r\n  increase of the angular momentum about OB´, investigated as above, we\r\n  find\r\n\r\n     /             a             \\                a²\r\n    ( C + Ma² + A --- cos [theta] ) [.psi]² = Mg --- cot [theta],  (4)\r\n     \\             c             /                c\r\n\r\n  where use has been made of the obvious relation n[alpha] = c[.psi]. If\r\n  c and [theta] be given this formula determines the value of [psi] for\r\n  which the motion will be steady.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the top, the equation of energy and the condition of\r\nconstant angular momentum ([mu]) about the vertical OZ are sufficient to\r\ndetermine the motion of the axis. Thus, we have\r\n\r\n  ½A ([.theta]² + sin² [theta][.psi]²) + ½Cn² + Mgh cos [theta] = const.,  (5)\r\n\r\n  A sin² [theta][.psi] + [nu] cos [theta] = [mu],  (6)\r\n\r\nwhere [nu] is written for Cn. From these [.psi] may be eliminated, and\r\non differentiating the resulting equation with respect to t we obtain\r\n\r\n              ([mu] - [nu] cos [theta])([mu] cos [theta] - [nu])\r\n  A[:theta] - -------------------------------------------------- - Mgh sin [theta] = 0.  (7)\r\n                                  A sin³ [theta]\r\n\r\nIf we put [:theta] = 0 we get the condition of steady precessional\r\nmotion in a form equivalent to (3). To find the small oscillation about\r\na state of steady precession in which the axis makes a constant angle\r\n[alpha] with the vertical, we write [theta] = [alpha] + [chi], and\r\nneglect terms of the second order in [chi]. The result is of the form\r\n\r\n  [:chi] + [sigma]²[chi] = 0,  (8)\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n  [sigma]² = {([mu] - [nu] cos [alpha])² + 2([mu] - [nu] cos [alpha])([mu] cos [alpha] - [nu])\r\n     cos [alpha] + ([mu] cos [alpha] - [nu])²} / A² sin^4 [alpha].  (9)\r\n\r\nWhen [nu] is large we have, for the \"slow\" precession [sigma] = [nu]/A,\r\nand for the \"rapid\" precession [sigma] = A/[nu] cos [alpha] = [.psi],\r\napproximately. Further, on examining the small variation in [.psi], it\r\nappears that in a slightly disturbed slow precession the motion of any\r\npoint of the axis consists of a rapid circular vibration superposed on\r\nthe steady precession, so that the resultant path has a trochoidal\r\ncharacter. This is a type of motion commonly observed in a top spun in\r\nthe ordinary way, although the successive undulations of the trochoid\r\nmay be too small to be easily observed. In a slightly disturbed rapid\r\nprecession the superposed vibration is elliptic-harmonic, with a period\r\nequal to that of the precession itself. The ratio of the axes of the\r\nellipse is sec [alpha], the longer axis being in the plane of [theta].\r\nThe result is that the axis of the top describes a circular cone about a\r\nfixed line making a small angle with the vertical. This is, in fact, the\r\n\"invariable line\" of the free Eulerian rotation with which (as already\r\nremarked) we are here virtually concerned. For the more general\r\ndiscussion of the motion of a top see GYROSCOPE.\r\n\r\n§ 21. _Moving Axes of Reference._--For the more general treatment of the\r\nkinetics of a rigid body it is usually convenient to adopt a system of\r\nmoving axes. In order that the moments and products of inertia with\r\nrespect to these axes may be constant, it is in general necessary to\r\nsuppose them fixed in the solid.\r\n\r\nWe will assume for the present that the origin O is fixed. The moving\r\naxes Ox, Oy, Oz form a rigid frame of reference whose motion at time t\r\nmay be specified by the three component angular velocities p, q, r. The\r\ncomponents of angular momentum about Ox, Oy, Oz will be denoted as usual\r\nby [lambda], [mu], [nu]. Now consider a system of fixed axes Ox´, Oy´,\r\nOz´ chosen so as to coincide at the instant t with the moving system Ox,\r\nOy, Oz. At the instant t + [delta]t, Ox, Oy, Oz will no longer coincide\r\nwith Ox´, Oy´, Oz´; in particular they will make with Ox´ angles whose\r\ncosines are, to the first order, 1, -r[delta]t, q[delta]t, respectively.\r\nHence the altered angular momentum about Ox´ will be [lambda] +\r\n[delta][lambda] + ([mu] + [delta][mu]) (-r[delta]t) + ([nu] +\r\n[delta][nu]) q[delta]t. If L, M, N be the moments of the extraneous\r\nforces about Ox, Oy, Oz this must be equal to [lambda] + L[delta]t.\r\nHence, and by symmetry, we obtain\r\n\r\n  d[lambda]                       \\\r\n  --------- - r[nu] + q[nu] = L,  |\r\n     dt                           |\r\n                                  |\r\n  d[mu]                           |\r\n  ----- - p[nu] + r[lanbda] = M,   >  (1)\r\n   dt                             |\r\n                                  |\r\n  d[nu]                           |\r\n  ----- - q[lambda] + p[nu] = N.  |\r\n   dt                             /\r\n\r\nThese equations are applicable to any dynamical system whatever. If we\r\nnow apply them to the case of a rigid body moving about a fixed point O,\r\nand make Ox, Oy, Oz coincide with the principal axes of inertia at O, we\r\nhave [lambda], [mu], [nu] = Ap, Bq, Cr, whence\r\n\r\n    dp                    \\\r\n  A -- - (B - C) qr = L,  |\r\n    dt                    |\r\n                          |\r\n    dq                    |\r\n  B -- - (C - A) rp = M,   >  (2)\r\n    dt                    |\r\n                          |\r\n    dr                    |\r\n  C -- - (A - B) pq = N.  |\r\n    dt                    /\r\n\r\nIf we multiply these by p, q, r and add, we get\r\n\r\n   d\r\n  --- · ½(Ap² + Bq² + Cr²) = Lp + Mq + Nr,  (3)\r\n  dt\r\n\r\nwhich is (virtually) the equation of energy.\r\n\r\nAs a first application of the equations (2) take the case of a solid\r\nconstrained to rotate with constant angular velocity [omega] about a\r\nfixed axis (l, m, n). Since p, q, r are then constant, the requisite\r\nconstraining couple is\r\n\r\n  L = (C - B) mn[omega]², M = (A - C) nl[omega]², N = (B - A) lm[omega]².  (4)\r\n\r\nIf we reverse the signs, we get the \"centrifugal couple\" exerted by the\r\nsolid on its bearings. This couple vanishes when the axis of rotation is\r\na principal axis at O, and in no other case (cf. § 17).\r\n\r\nIf in (2) we put, L, M, N = O we get the case of free rotation; thus\r\n\r\n    dp                \\\r\n  A -- = (B - C) qr,  |\r\n    dt                |\r\n                      |\r\n    dq                |\r\n  B -- = (C - A) rp,   >  (5)\r\n    dt                |\r\n                      |\r\n    dr                |\r\n  C -- = (A - B) pq.  |\r\n    dt                /\r\n\r\nThese equations are due to Euler, with whom the conception of moving\r\naxes, and the application to the problem of free rotation, originated.\r\nIf we multiply them by p, q, r, respectively, or again by Ap, Bq, Cr\r\nrespectively, and add, we verify that the expressions Ap² + Bq² + Cr²\r\nand A²p² + B²q² + C²r² are both constant. The former is, in fact, equal\r\nto 2T, and the latter to [Gamma]², where T is the kinetic energy and\r\n[Gamma] the resultant angular momentum.\r\n\r\n  To complete the solution of (2) a third integral is required; this\r\n  involves in general the use of elliptic functions. The problem has\r\n  been the subject of numerous memoirs; we will here notice only the\r\n  form of solution given by Rueb (1834), and at a later period by G.\r\n  Kirchhoff (1875), If we write\r\n           _\r\n          / [phi]   d[phi]\r\n    u  =  |      ------------, [Delta][phi] = [root](1 - k² sin² [phi]),\r\n         _/ 0    [Delta][phi]\r\n\r\n  we have, in the notation of elliptic functions, [phi] = am u. If we\r\n  assume\r\n\r\n    p = p0 cos am ([sigma]t + [epsilon]), q = q0sin am ([sigma]t + [epsilon]),\r\n    r = r0[Delta] am ([sigma]t + [epsilon]),  (7)\r\n\r\n  we find\r\n\r\n             [sigma]p0            [sigma]q0              k²[sigma]r0\r\n    [.p] = - --------- qr, [.q] = --------- rp, [.r] = - ----------- pq.  (8)\r\n               q0r0                 r0p0                    p0q0\r\n\r\n  Hence (5) will be satisfied, provided\r\n\r\n    -[sigma]p0   B - C  [sigma]q0   C - A  -k²[sigma]r0   A - B\r\n    ---------- = -----, --------- = -----, ------------ = -----.

We will suppose that A > B > C. From the form\r\n  of the polhode curves referred to in § 19 it appears that the angular\r\n  velocity q about the axis of mean moment must vanish periodically. If\r\n  we adopt one of these epochs as the origin of t, we have [epsilon] =\r\n  0, and p0, r0 will become identical with the initial values of p, r.\r\n  The conditions (9) then lead to\r\n\r\n          A(A - C)                 (A - C)(B - C)           A(A - B)   p0²\r\n    q0² = -------- p0², [sigma]² = -------------- r0², k² = -------- · ---.

If the initial\r\n  conditions are such as to make 2BT < [Gamma]², we must interchange the\r\n  forms of p and r in (7). In the present case the instantaneous axis\r\n  returns to its initial position in the body whenever [phi] increases\r\n  by 2[pi], i.e. whenever t increases by 4K/[sigma], when K is the\r\n  \"complete\" elliptic integral of the first kind with respect to the\r\n  modulus k.\r\n\r\n  The elliptic functions degenerate into simpler forms when k² = 0 or k²\r\n  = 1. The former case arises when two of the principal moments are\r\n  equal; this has been sufficiently dealt with in § 19. If k² = 1, we\r\n  must have 2BT = [Gamma]². We have seen that the alternative 2BT <>\r\n  [Gamma]² determines whether the polhode cone surrounds the principal\r\n  axis of least or greatest moment. The case of 2BT = [Gamma]², exactly,\r\n  is therefore a critical case; it may be shown that the instantaneous\r\n  axis either coincides permanently with the axis of mean moment or\r\n  approaches it asymptotically.\r\n\r\nWhen the origin of the moving axes is also in motion with a velocity\r\nwhose components are u, v, w, the dynamical equations are\r\n\r\n  d[xi]                         d[eta]                         d[zeta]\r\n  ----- - r[eta] + q[zeta] = X, ------ - p[zeta] - r[chi] = Y, ------- - q[chi] + p[eta] = Z,  (11)\r\n   dt                             dt                              dt\r\n\r\n  d[lambda]                                         d[mu]                                           \\\r\n  --------- - r[mu] + q[nu] - w[eta] + v[zeta] = L, ----- - p[nu] + r[lambda]- u[zeta] + w[xi] = M, |\r\n     dt                                              dt                                             |\r\n                                                                                                     >  (12)\r\n  d[nu]                                                                                             |\r\n  ----- - q[lambda] + p[mu] - v[xi] + u[eta] = N.                                                   /\r\n   dt\r\n\r\nTo prove these, we may take fixed axes O´x´, O´y´, O´z´ coincident with\r\nthe moving axes at time t, and compare the linear and angular momenta\r\n[xi] + [delta][xi], [eta] + [delta][eta], [zeta] + [delta][zeta],\r\n[lambda] + [delta][lambda], [mu] + [delta][mu], [nu] + [delta][nu]\r\nrelative to the new position of the axes, Ox, Oy, Oz at time t +\r\n[delta]t with the original momenta [xi], [eta], [zeta], [lambda], [mu],\r\n[nu] relative to O´x´, O´y´, O´z´ at time t. As in the case of (2), the\r\nequations are applicable to any dynamical system whatever. If the moving\r\norigin coincide always with the mass-centre, we have [xi], [eta], [zeta]\r\n= M0u, M0v, M0w, where M0 is the total mass, and the equations simplify.\r\n\r\nWhen, in any problem, the values of u, v, w, p, q, r have been\r\ndetermined as functions of t, it still remains to connect the moving\r\naxes with some fixed frame of reference. It will be sufficient to take\r\nthe case of motion about a fixed point O; the angular co-ordinates\r\n[theta], [phi], [psi] of Euler may then be used for the purpose.\r\nReferring to fig. 36 we see that the angular velocities p, q, r of the\r\nmoving lines, OA, OB, OC about their instantaneous positions are\r\n\r\n  p = [.theta] sin [phi] - sin [theta] cos [phi][.psi],  \\\r\n  q = [.theta] cos [phi] + sin [theta] sin [phi][.psi],   >  (13)\r\n  r = [.phi] + cos [theta][.psi],                        /\r\n\r\nby § 7 (3), (4). If OA, OB, OC be principal axes of inertia of a solid,\r\nand if A, B, C denote the corresponding moments of inertia, the kinetic\r\nenergy is given by\r\n\r\n  2T = A([.theta] sin [phi] - sin [theta] cos [phi][.psi])²   \\\r\n     + B([.theta] cos [phi] + sin [theta] sin [theta][psi])²   >  (14)\r\n     + C([.phi] + cos [theta][.psi])².                        /\r\n\r\nIf A = B this reduces to\r\n\r\n  2T = A([.theta]² + sin² [theta][.psi]²) + C([.phi] + cos [theta][.psi])²;  (15)\r\n\r\ncf. § 20 (1).\r\n\r\n§ 22. _Equations of Motion in Generalized Co-ordinates._--Suppose we\r\nhave a dynamical system composed of a finite number of material\r\nparticles or rigid bodies, whether free or constrained in any way, which\r\nare subject to mutual forces and also to the action of any given\r\nextraneous forces. The configuration of such a system can be completely\r\nspecified by means of a certain number (n) of independent quantities,\r\ncalled the generalized co-ordinates of the system. These co-ordinates\r\nmay be chosen in an endless variety of ways, but their number is\r\ndeterminate, and expresses the number of _degrees of freedom_ of the\r\nsystem. We denote these co-ordinates by q1, q2, ... q_n. It is implied\r\nin the above description of the system that the Cartesian co-ordinates\r\nx, y, z of any particle of the system are known functions of the q's,\r\nvarying in form (of course) from particle to particle. Hence the kinetic\r\nenergy T is given by\r\n\r\n        __\r\n  2T = \\   {m([.x]² + [.y]² + [.z]²)}\r\n       /__\r\n\r\n     = a11[.q]1² + a22[.q]2² + ... + 2a12[.q]1[.q]2 + ...,  (1)\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n              _                                              _\r\n          __ |   {  / [dP]x \\²    / [dP]y \\²    / [dP]z \\² }  |                    \\\r\n  a_rr = \\   | m { ( ------- ) + ( ------- ) + ( ------- ) }  |,                   |\r\n         /__ |_  {  \\[dP]q_r/     \\[dP]q_r/     \\[dP]q_r/  } _|                    |\r\n              _                                                         _           >  (2)\r\n          __ |    / [dP]x   [dP]x     [dP]y   [dP]y     [dP]z   [dP]z \\  |         |\r\n  a_rs = \\   | m ( ------- ------- + ------- ------- + ------- ------- ) | = a_sr. |\r\n         /__ |_   \\[dP]q_r [dP]q_s   [dP]q_r [dP]q_s   [dP]q_r [dP]q_s/ _|         /\r\n\r\nThus T is expressed as a homogeneous quadratic function of the\r\nquantities [.q]1, [.q]2, ... [.q]_n, which are called the _generalized\r\ncomponents of velocity_. The coefficients a_rr, a_rs are called the\r\ncoefficients of inertia; they are not in general constants, being\r\nfunctions of the q's and so variable with the configuration.

The\r\n  displacements of P due to small variations of these co-ordinates are\r\n  [dP]r along OP, r [delta][theta] perpendicular to OP in the plane ZOP,\r\n  and r sin [theta] [delta][psi] perpendicular to this plane. The\r\n  component velocities in these directions are therefore [.r],\r\n  r[.theta], r sin [theta][.psi], and if m be the mass of a moving\r\n  particle at P we have\r\n\r\n    2T = m([.r]² + r²[.theta]² + r² sin² [theta][.psi]²).  (21)\r\n\r\n  Hence the formula (11) gives\r\n\r\n    m([:r] - r[.theta]² - r sin² [theta][.psi]²) = R,                  \\\r\n                                                                       |\r\n     d                                                                 |\r\n    ---(mr²[.theta]) - mr² · sin [theta] cos [theta][.psi]² = [Theta],  >  (22)\r\n    dt                                                                 |\r\n                                                                       |\r\n     d                                                                 |\r\n    ---(mr² sin² [theta][.psi]) = [Psi].                               /\r\n    dt\r\n\r\n  The quantities R, [Theta], [Psi] are the coefficients in the\r\n  expression R [delta]r + [Theta] [delta][theta] + [Psi] [delta][psi]\r\n  for the work done in an infinitely small displacement; viz. R is the\r\n  radial component of force, [Theta] is the moment about a line through\r\n  O perpendicular to the plane ZOP, and [Psi] is the moment about OZ. In\r\n  the case of the spherical pendulum we have r = l, [Theta] = - mgl sin\r\n  [theta], [Psi] = 0, if OZ be drawn vertically downwards, and therefore\r\n\r\n                                                   g               \\\r\n    [:theta] - sin [theta] cos [theta][.psi]² = - --- sin [theta], |\r\n                                                   l                >  (23)\r\n                                                                   |\r\n    sin² [theta][.psi] = h,                                        /\r\n\r\n\r\n  where h is a constant. The latter equation expresses that the angular\r\n  momentum ml² sin² [theta][.psi] about the vertical OZ is constant. By\r\n  elimination of [.psi] we obtain\r\n\r\n                                                   g\r\n    [:theta] - h² cos² [theta] / sin^3[theta] = - --- sin [theta].  (24)\r\n                                                   l\r\n\r\n  If the particle describes a horizontal circle of angular radius\r\n  [alpha] with constant angular velocity [Omega], we have [.omega] = 0,\r\n  h = [Omega]² sin [alpha], and therefore\r\n\r\n                g\r\n    [Omega]² = --- cos [alpha],  (25)\r\n                l\r\n\r\n  as is otherwise evident from the elementary theory of uniform circular\r\n  motion. To investigate the small oscillations about this state of\r\n  steady motion we write [theta] = [alpha] + [chi] in (24) and neglect\r\n  terms of the second order in [chi]. We find, after some reductions,\r\n\r\n    [:chi] + (1 + 3 cos² [alpha]) [Omega]²[chi] = 0;  (26)\r\n\r\n  this shows that the variation of [chi] is simple-harmonic, with the\r\n  period\r\n\r\n    2[pi]/[root](1 + 3 cos² [alpha])·[Omega]\r\n\r\n  As regards the most general motion of a spherical pendulum, it is\r\n  obvious that a particle moving under gravity on a smooth sphere cannot\r\n  pass through the highest or lowest point unless it describes a\r\n  vertical circle. In all other cases there must be an upper and a lower\r\n  limit to the altitude. Again, a vertical plane passing through O and a\r\n  point where the motion is horizontal is evidently a plane of symmetry\r\n  as regards the path. Hence the path will be confined between two\r\n  horizontal circles which it touches alternately, and the direction of\r\n  motion is never horizontal except at these circles. In the case of\r\n  disturbed steady motion, just considered, these circles are nearly\r\n  coincident. When both are near the lowest point the horizontal\r\n  projection of the path is approximately an ellipse, as shown in § 13;\r\n  a closer investigation shows that the ellipse is to be regarded as\r\n  revolving about its centre with the angular velocity 2/3 ab[Omega]/l²,\r\n  where a, b are the semi-axes.\r\n\r\n  To apply the equations (11) to the case of the top we start with the\r\n  expression (15) of § 21 for the kinetic energy, the simplified form\r\n  (1) of § 20 being for the present purpose inadmissible, since it is\r\n  essential that the generalized co-ordinates employed should be\r\n  competent to specify the position of every particle. If [lambda],\r\n  [mu], [nu] be the components of momentum, we have\r\n\r\n                   [dP]T                                                                  \\\r\n    [lambda]=  ------------ = A[.theta],                                                  |\r\n               [dP][.theta]                                                               |\r\n                                                                                          |\r\n             [dP]T                                                                        |\r\n    [mu] = ---------- = A sin² [theta][.psi] + C([.phi] + cos [theta][.psi]) cos [theta],  >  (27)\r\n           [dP][.psi]                                                                     |\r\n                                                                                          |\r\n             [dP]T                                                                        |\r\n    [nu] = ---------- = C ([.theta] + cos [theta][.psi]).                                 /\r\n           [dP][.phi]\r\n\r\n  The meaning of these quantities is easily recognized; thus [lambda] is\r\n  the angular momentum about a horizontal axis normal to the plane of\r\n  [theta], [mu] is the angular momentum about the vertical OZ, and [nu]\r\n  is the angular momentum about the axis of symmetry. If M be the total\r\n  mass, the potential energy is V = Mgh cos [theta], if OZ be drawn\r\n  vertically upwards. Hence the equations (11) become\r\n\r\n    A[:theta] - A sin [theta] cos [theta][.psi]² + C([.phi] + cos [theta][.psi]) [.psi] sin [theta] = Mgh sin [theta], \\\r\n              d/dt · {A sin² [theta][.psi] + C([.phi] + cos [theta][.psi]) cos [theta]} = 0,                            >  (28)\r\n              d/dt · {C([.phi] + cos [theta][.psi])} = 0,                                                              /\r\n\r\n  of which the last two express the constancy of the momenta [mu], [nu].\r\n  Hence\r\n\r\n    A[:theta] - A sin [theta] cos [theta][.psi]² + [nu] sin [theta][.psi] = Mgh sin [theta],  \\  (29)\r\n    A sin² [theta][.psi] + [nu] cos [theta] = [mu].                                           /\r\n\r\n  If we eliminate [.psi] we obtain the equation (7) of § 20. The theory\r\n  of disturbed precessional motion there outlined does not give a\r\n  convenient view of the oscillations of the axis about the vertical\r\n  position. If [theta] be small the equations (29) may be written\r\n\r\n                                    [nu]²- 4AMgh         \\\r\n    [:theta] - [theta][.omega]² = - ------------[theta],  >  (30)\r\n                                         4A²             |\r\n    [theta]²[.omega] = const.,                           /\r\n\r\n  where\r\n\r\n                      [nu]\r\n    [omega] = [psi] - ---- t.  (31)\r\n                       2A\r\n\r\n  Since [theta], [omega] are the polar co-ordinates (in a horizontal\r\n  plane) of a point on the axis of symmetry, relative to an initial line\r\n  which revolves with constant angular velocity [nu]/2A, we see by\r\n  comparison with § 14 (15) (16) that the motion of such a point will be\r\n  elliptic-harmonic superposed on a uniform rotation [nu]/2A, provided\r\n  [nu]² > 4AMgh. This gives (in essentials) the theory of the\r\n  \"gyroscopic pendulum.\"\r\n\r\n§ 23. _Stability of Equilibrium. Theory of Vibrations._--If, in a\r\nconservative system, the configuration (q1, q2, ... q_n) be one of\r\nequilibrium, the equations (14) of § 22 must be satisfied by [.q]1,\r\n[.q]2 ... [.q]_n = 0, whence\r\n\r\n  [dP]V / [dP]q_r = 0.  (1)\r\n\r\nA necessary and sufficient condition of equilibrium is therefore that\r\nthe value of the potential energy should be stationary for infinitesimal\r\nvariations of the co-ordinates. If, further, V be a minimum, the\r\nequilibrium is necessarily stable, as was shown by P. G. L. Dirichlet\r\n(1846). In the motion consequent on any slight disturbance the total\r\nenergy T + V is constant, and since T is essentially positive it follows\r\nthat V can never exceed its equilibrium value by more than a slight\r\namount, depending on the energy of the disturbance. This implies, on the\r\npresent hypothesis, that there is an upper limit to the deviation of\r\neach co-ordinate from its equilibrium value; moreover, this limit\r\ndiminishes indefinitely with the energy of the original disturbance. No\r\nsuch simple proof is available to show without qualification that the\r\nabove condition is _necessary_. If, however, we recognize the existence\r\nof dissipative forces called into play by any motion whatever of the\r\nsystem, the conclusion can be drawn as follows. However slight these\r\nforces may be, the total energy T + V must continually diminish so long\r\nas the velocities [.q]1, [.q]2, ... [.q]_n differ from zero. Hence if\r\nthe system be started from rest in a configuration for which V is less\r\nthan in the equilibrium configuration considered, this quantity must\r\nstill further decrease (since T cannot be negative), and it is evident\r\nthat either the system will finally come to rest in some other\r\nequilibrium configuration, or V will in the long run diminish\r\nindefinitely. This argument is due to Lord Kelvin and P. G. Tait (1879).\r\n\r\nIn discussing the small oscillations of a system about a configuration\r\nof stable equilibrium it is convenient so to choose the generalized\r\ncc-ordinates q1, q2, ... q_n that they shall vanish in the configuration\r\nin question. The potential energy is then given with sufficient\r\napproximation by an expression of the form\r\n\r\n  2V = c11q1² + c22q2² + ... + 2c12q1q2 + ...,  (2)\r\n\r\na constant term being irrelevant, and the terms of the first order being\r\nabsent since the equilibrium value of V is stationary. The coefficients\r\nc_rr, c_rs are called _coefficients of stability_. We may further treat\r\nthe coefficients of inertia a_rr, a_rs of § 22 (1) as constants. The\r\nLagrangian equations of motion are then of the type\r\n\r\n  a_(1r)[:q]1 + a_(2r)[:q]2 + ... + a_(nr)[:q]_n + c_(1r)q1 + c_(2r)q2 + ... + c_(nr)q_n = Q_r,  (3)\r\n\r\nwhere Q_r now stands for a component of extraneous force. In a _free\r\noscillation_ we have Q1, Q2, ... Q_n = 0, and if we assume\r\n\r\n  q_r = A_r e^(i[sigma]^t),  (4)\r\n\r\nwe obtain n equations of the type\r\n\r\n  (c_(1r) - [sigma]²a_(1r)) A1 + (c_(2r) - [sigma]²a_(2r)) A2 + ... + (c_(nr) - [sigma]²a_nr) A_n = 0.  (5)\r\n\r\nEliminating the n - 1 ratios A1 : A2 : ... : A_n we obtain the\r\ndeterminantal equation\r\n\r\n  [Delta]([sigma]²) = 0,      (6)\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n  [Delta]([sigma]²) = | c11 - [sigma]²a11,      c21 - [sigma]²a21,       ..., C_(n1) - [sigma]²a_(nl) |\r\n                      | c12 - [sigma]²a12,      c22 - [sigma]²a22,       ..., C_(n2) - [sigma]²a_(n2) |\r\n                      |           .                       .              ...               .          |\r\n                      |           .                       .              ...               .          |  (7)\r\n                      |           .                       .              ...               .          |\r\n                      | c_(1n) - [sigma]²a{1n}, c_(2n) - [sigma]²a_(2n), ..., C_(nn) - [sigma]²a_(nn) |\r\n\r\nThe quadratic expression for T is essentially positive, and the same\r\nholds with regard to V in virtue of the assumed stability. It may be\r\nshown algebraically that under these conditions the n roots of the above\r\nequation in [sigma]² are all real and positive. For any particular root,\r\nthe equations (5) determine the ratios of the quantities A1, A2, ...\r\nA_n, the absolute values being alone arbitrary; these quantities are in\r\nfact proportional to the minors of any one row in the determinate\r\n[Delta]([sigma]²). By combining the solutions corresponding to a pair of\r\nequal and opposite values of [sigma] we obtain a solution in real form:\r\n\r\n  q_r = C_(a_r) cos ([sigma]t + [epsilon]),  (8)\r\n\r\nwhere a1, a2 ... a_r are a determinate series of quantities having to\r\none another the above-mentioned ratios, whilst the constants C,\r\n[epsilon] are arbitrary. This solution, taken by itself, represents a\r\nmotion in which each particle of the system (since its displacements\r\nparallel to Cartesian co-ordinate axes are linear functions of the q's)\r\nexecutes a simple vibration of period 2[pi]/[sigma]. The amplitudes of\r\noscillation of the various particles have definite ratios to one\r\nanother, and the phases are in agreement, the absolute amplitude\r\n(depending on C) and the phase-constant ([epsilon]) being alone\r\narbitrary. A vibration of this character is called a _normal mode_ of\r\nvibration of the system; the number n of such modes is equal to that of\r\nthe degrees of freedom possessed by the system. These statements require\r\nsome modification when two or more of the roots of the equation (6) are\r\nequal. In the case of a multiple root the minors of [Delta]([sigma]²)\r\nall vanish, and the basis for the determination of the quantities a_r\r\ndisappears. Two or more normal modes then become to some extent\r\nindeterminate, and elliptic vibrations of the individual particles are\r\npossible. An example is furnished by the spherical pendulum (§ 13).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.]\r\n\r\n  As an example of the method of determination of the normal modes we\r\n  may take the \"double pendulum.\" A mass M hangs from a fixed point by a\r\n  string of length a, and a second mass m hangs from M by a string of\r\n  length b. For simplicity we will suppose that the motion is confined\r\n  to one vertical plane. If [theta], [phi] be the inclinations of the\r\n  two strings to the vertical, we have, approximately,\r\n\r\n    2T = Ma²[.theta]² + m(a[.theta] + b[.psi])²  \\  (9)\r\n    2V = Mga[theta]² + mg(a[theta]² + b[psi]²).  /\r\n\r\n  The equations (3) take the forms\r\n\r\n    a[:theta] + [mu]b[:phi] + g[theta] = 0,  \\  (10)\r\n    a[:theta] + b[:phi] + g[phi] = 0.        /\r\n\r\n  where [mu] = m/(M + m). Hence\r\n\r\n    ([sigma]² - g/a)a[theta] + [mu][sigma]²b[phi] = 0,  \\  (11)\r\n    [sigma]²a[theta] + ([sigma]² - g/b)b[phi] = 0.      /\r\n\r\n  The frequency equation is therefore\r\n\r\n    ([sigma]² - g/a)([sigma]² - g/b) - [mu][sigma]^4 = 0.  (12)\r\n\r\n  The roots of this quadratic in [sigma]² are easily seen to be real and\r\n  positive. If M be large compared with m, [mu] is small, and the roots\r\n  are g/a and g/b, approximately. In the normal mode corresponding to\r\n  the former root, M swings almost like the bob of a simple pendulum of\r\n  length a, being comparatively uninfluenced by the presence of m,\r\n  whilst m executes a \"forced\" vibration (§ 12) of the corresponding\r\n  period. In the second mode, M is nearly at rest [as appears from the\r\n  second of equations (11)], whilst m swings almost like the bob of a\r\n  simple pendulum of length b. Whatever the ratio M/m, the two values of\r\n  [sigma]² can never be exactly equal, but they are approximately equal\r\n  if a, b are nearly equal and [mu] is very small. A curious phenomenon\r\n  is then to be observed; the motion of each particle, being made up (in\r\n  general) of two superposed simple vibrations of nearly equal period,\r\n  is seen to fluctuate greatly in extent, and if the amplitudes be equal\r\n  we have periods of approximate rest, as in the case of \"beats\" in\r\n  acoustics. The vibration then appears to be transferred alternately\r\n  from m to M at regular intervals. If, on the other hand, M is small\r\n  compared with m, [mu] is nearly equal to unity, and the roots of (12)\r\n  are [sigma]² = g/(a + b) and [sigma]² = mg/M·(a + b)/ab,\r\n  approximately. The former root makes [theta] = [phi], nearly; in the\r\n  corresponding normal mode m oscillates like the bob of a simple\r\n  pendulum of length a + b. In the second mode a[theta] + b[phi] = 0,\r\n  nearly, so that m is approximately at rest. The oscillation of M then\r\n  resembles that of a particle at a distance a from one end of a string\r\n  of length a + b fixed at the ends and subject to a tension mg.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the system consequent on arbitrary initial conditions may\r\nbe obtained by superposition of the n normal modes with suitable\r\namplitudes and phases. We have then\r\n\r\n  q_r = [alpha]_r[theta] + [alpha]_r´[theta]´ + [alpha]_r´´[theta]´´ + ...,  (13)\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n  [theta] = C cos ([sigma]t + [epsilon]), [theta]´\r\n    = C´ cos ([sigma]´t + [epsilon]), [theta]´´\r\n    = C´´ cos([sigma]´´t + [epsilon]), ...  (14)\r\n\r\nprovided [sigma]², [sigma]´², [sigma]´´², ... are the n roots of (6).\r\nThe coefficients of [theta], [theta]´, [theta]´´, ... in (13) satisfy\r\nthe _conjugate_ or _orthogonal_ relations\r\n\r\n  a11[alpha]1[alpha]1´ + a22[alpha]2[alpha]2´ + ... + a12([alpha]1[alpha]2´ + [alpha]2[alpha]1´) + ... = 0,  (15)\r\n  c11[alpha]1[alpha]1´ + c22[alpha]2[alpha]2´ + ... + c12([alpha]1[alpha]2´ + [alpha]2[alpha]1´) + ... = 0,  (16)\r\n\r\nprovided the symbols [alpha]_r, [alpha]_r´ correspond to two distinct\r\nroots [sigma]², [sigma]´² of (6). To prove these relations, we replace\r\nthe symbols A1, A2, ... A_n in (5) by [alpha]1, [alpha]2, ... [alpha]_n\r\nrespectively, multiply the resulting equations by a´1, a´2, ... a´_n, in\r\norder, and add. The result, owing to its symmetry, must still hold if we\r\ninterchange accented and unaccented Greek letters, and by comparison we\r\ndeduce (15) and (16), provided [sigma]² and [sigma]´² are unequal. The\r\nactual determination of C, C´, C´´, ... and [epsilon], [epsilon]´,\r\n[epsilon]´´, ... in terms of the initial conditions is as follows. If we\r\nwrite\r\n\r\n  C cos [epsilon] = H, -C sin [epsilon] = K,  (17)\r\n\r\nwe must have\r\n\r\n  [alpha]_rH + [alpha]_r´H´ + [alpha]_r´´H´´ + ...                         = [q_r]0,    \\  (18)\r\n  [sigma][alpha]_rH + [sigma]´[alpha]_r´H´ + [sigma]´´[alpha]_r´´H´´ + ... = [[.q]_r]0, /\r\n\r\nwhere the zero suffix indicates initial values. These equations can be\r\nat once solved for H, H´, H´´, ... and K, K´, K´´, ... by means of the\r\northogonal relations (15).\r\n\r\nBy a suitable choice of the generalized co-ordinates it is possible to\r\nreduce T and V simultaneously to sums of squares. The transformation is\r\nin fact effected by the assumption (13), in virtue of the relations (15)\r\n(16), and we may write\r\n\r\n  2T = a[.theta]² + a´[.theta]´² + a´´[.theta]´´² + ..., \\  (19)\r\n  2V = c[theta]² + c´[theta]´² + c´´[theta]´´² + ....    /\r\n\r\nThe new co-ordinates [theta], [theta]´, [theta]´´ ... are called the\r\n_normal_ co-ordinates of the system; in a normal mode of vibration one\r\nof these varies alone. The physical characteristics of a normal mode are\r\nthat an impulse of a particular normal type generates an initial\r\nvelocity of that type only, and that a constant extraneous force of a\r\nparticular normal type maintains a displacement of that type only. The\r\nnormal modes are further distinguished by an important \"stationary\"\r\nproperty, as regards the frequency. If we imagine the system reduced by\r\nfrictionless constraints to one degree of freedom, so that the\r\nco-ordinates [theta], [theta]´, [theta]´´, ... have prescribed ratios to\r\none another, we have, from (19),\r\n\r\n             c[theta]² + c´[theta]´² = c´´[theta]´´² + ...\r\n  [sigma]² = ---------------------------------------------,  (20)\r\n             a[theta]² + a´[theta]´² + a´´[theta]´´² + ...\r\n\r\nThis shows that the value of [sigma]² for the constrained mode is\r\nintermediate to the greatest and least of the values c/a, c´/a´,\r\nc´´/a´´, ... proper to the several normal modes. Also that if the\r\nconstrained mode differs little from a normal mode of free vibration\r\n(e.g. if [theta]´, [theta]´´, ... are small compared with [theta]), the\r\nchange in the frequency is of the second order. This property can often\r\nbe utilized to estimate the frequency of the gravest normal mode of a\r\nsystem, by means of an assumed approximate type, when the exact\r\ndetermination would be difficult. It also appears that an estimate thus\r\nobtained is necessarily too high.\r\n\r\nFrom another point of view it is easily recognized that the equations\r\n(5) are exactly those to which we are led in the ordinary process of\r\nfinding the stationary values of the function\r\n\r\n  V (q1, q2, ... q_n)\r\n  ------------------------,\r\n  T (q1, q2, ... q_n)\r\n\r\nwhere the denominator stands for the same homogeneous quadratic function\r\nof the q's that T is for the [.q]'s. It is easy to construct in this\r\nconnexion a proof that the n values of [sigma]² are all real and\r\npositive.\r\n\r\n  The case of three degrees of freedom is instructive on account of the\r\n  geometrical analogies. With a view to these we may write\r\n\r\n    2T= a[.x]² + b[.y]² + c[.z]² + 2f[.y][.z] + 2g[.z][.x] + 2h[.x][.y],  \\  (21)\r\n    2V = Ax² + By² + Cz² + 2Fyz + 2Gzx + 2Hxy.                            /\r\n\r\n  It is obvious that the ratio\r\n\r\n    V (x, y, z)\r\n    -----------  (22)\r\n    T (x, y, z)\r\n\r\n  must have a least value, which is moreover positive, since the\r\n  numerator and denominator are both essentially positive. Denoting this\r\n  value by [sigma]1², we have\r\n\r\n    Ax1 + Hy1 + Gz1 = [sigma]1²(ax1 + hy1 + [dP]gz1), \\\r\n    Hx1 + By1 + Fz1 = [sigma]1²(hx1 + by1 + fz1),      >  (23)\r\n    Gx1 + Fy1 + Cz1 = [sigma]1²(gx1 + fy1 + cz1),     /\r\n\r\n  provided x1 : y1 : z1 be the corresponding values of the ratios x:y:z.\r\n  Again, the expression (22) will also have a least value when the\r\n  ratios x : y : z are subject to the condition\r\n\r\n       [dP]V      [dP]V      [dP]V\r\n    x1 ----- + y1 ----- + z1 ----- = 0;  (24)\r\n       [dP]x      [dP]y      [dP]z\r\n\r\n  and if this be denoted by [sigma]2² we have a second system of\r\n  equations similar to (23). The remaining value [sigma]2² is the value\r\n  of (22) when x : y : z arc chosen so as to satisfy (24) and\r\n\r\n       [dP]V      [dP]V      [dP]V\r\n    x2 ----- + y2 ----- + z2 ----- = 0  (25)\r\n       [dP]x      [dP]y      [dP]z\r\n\r\n  The problem is identical with that of finding the common conjugate\r\n  diameters of the ellipsoids T(x, y, z) = const., V(x, y, z) = const.\r\n  If in (21) we imagine that x, y, z denote infinitesimal rotations of a\r\n  solid free to turn about a fixed point in a given field of force, it\r\n  appears that the three normal modes consist each of a rotation about\r\n  one of the three diameters aforesaid, and that the values of [sigma]\r\n  are proportional to the ratios of the lengths of corresponding\r\n  diameters of the two quadrics.\r\n\r\nWe proceed to the _forced vibrations_ of the system. The typical case is\r\nwhere the extraneous forces are of the simple-harmonic type cos\r\n([sigma]t + [epsilon]); the most general law of variation with time can\r\nbe derived from this by superposition, in virtue of Fourier's theorem.\r\nAnalytically, it is convenient to put Q_r, equal to e^(i[sigma]^t)\r\nmultiplied by a complex coefficient; owing to the linearity of the\r\nequations the factor e^(i[sigma]^t) will run through them all, and need\r\nnot always be exhibited. For a system of one degree of freedom we have\r\n\r\n  a[:q] + cq = Q,  (26)\r\n\r\nand therefore on the present supposition as to the nature of Q\r\n\r\n            Q\r\n  q = -------------.  (27)\r\n      c - [sigma]²a\r\n\r\nThis solution has been discussed to some extent in § 12, in connexion\r\nwith the forced oscillations of a pendulum. We may note further that\r\nwhen [sigma] is small the displacement q has the \"equilibrium value\"\r\nQ/c, the same as would be produced by a steady force equal to the\r\ninstantaneous value of the actual force, the inertia of the system being\r\ninoperative. On the other hand, when [sigma]² is great q tends to the\r\nvalue -Q/[sigma]²a, the same as if the potential energy were ignored.\r\nWhen there are n degrees of freedom we have from (3)\r\n\r\n  (c_(1r) - [sigma]² a_(2r)) q1 + (c²_r - [sigma]² a_(2r)) q2 + ... + (c_(nr) - [sigma]² a_(nr)) q_n = Qr,  (28)\r\n\r\nand therefore\r\n\r\n  [Delta]([sigma]²)·q_r = a_(1r)Q1 + a_(2r)Q2 + ... + a_(nr)Q_n,  (29)\r\n\r\nwhere a_(1r), a_(2r), ... a_(nr) are the minors of the rth row of the\r\ndeterminant (7). Every particle of the system executes in general a\r\nsimple vibration of the imposed period 2[pi]/[sigma], and all the\r\nparticles pass simultaneously through their equilibrium positions. The\r\namplitude becomes very great when [sigma]² approximates to a root of\r\n(6), i.e. when the imposed period nearly coincides with one of the free\r\nperiods. Since a_(rs) = a_(sr), the coefficient of Q_s in the expression\r\nfor q_r is identical with that of Q_r in the expression for q_s. Various\r\nimportant \"reciprocal theorems\" formulated by H. Helmholtz and Lord\r\nRayleigh are founded on this relation. Free vibrations must of course be\r\nsuperposed on the forced vibrations given by (29) in order to obtain the\r\ncomplete solution of the dynamical equations.\r\n\r\nIn practice the vibrations of a system are more or less affected by\r\ndissipative forces. In order to obtain at all events a qualitative\r\nrepresentation of these it is usual to introduce into the equations\r\nfrictional terms proportional to the velocities. Thus in the case of one\r\ndegree of freedom we have, in place of (26),\r\n\r\n  a[:q] + b[.q] + cq = Q,  (30)\r\n\r\nwhere a, b, c are positive. The solution of this has been sufficiently\r\ndiscussed in § 12. In the case of multiple freedom, the equations of\r\nsmall motion when modified by the introduction of terms proportional to\r\nthe velocities are of the type\r\n\r\n   d     [dP]T                                                       [dP]V\r\n  --- ---------- + B_(1r)[.q]1 + B_(2r)[.q]2 + ... + B_(nr)[.q]_n + ------- = Q_r  (31)\r\n  dt  [dP][.q]_r                                                    [dP]q_r\r\n\r\nIf we put\r\n\r\n  b_(rs) = b_(sr) = ½[B_(rs) + B_(sr)], [beta]_(rs) = -[beta]_(sr) = ½[B_(rs) - B_(sr)],  (32)\r\n\r\nthis may be written\r\n\r\n   d   [dP]T        [dP]F                                                                       [dP]V\r\n  --- --------- + ---------- + [beta]_(1r)[.q]1 + [beta]_(2r)[.q]2 + ... + [beta]_(nr)[.q]_r + -------  (33)\r\n  dt [dP][.q]_r   [dP][.q]_r                                                                   [dP]q_r\r\n\r\nprovided\r\n\r\n  2F = b11[.q]1² + b22[.q]2² + ... + 2b12[.q]1[.q]2 + ...  (34)\r\n\r\nThe terms due to F in (33) are such as would arise from frictional\r\nresistances proportional to the absolute velocities of the particles, or\r\nto mutual forces of resistance proportional to the relative velocities;\r\nthey are therefore classed as _frictional_ or _dissipative_ forces. The\r\nterms affected with the coefficients [beta]_(rs) on the other hand are\r\nsuch as occur in \"cyclic\" systems with latent motion (DYNAMICS, §\r\n_Analytical_); they are called the _gyrostatic terms_. If we multiply\r\n(33) by [.q]_r and sum with respect to r from 1 to n, we obtain, in\r\nvirtue of the relations [beta]_(rs) = -[beta]_(sr), [beta]_(rr) = 0,\r\n   d\r\n  ---(T + V) = 2F + Q1[.q]1 + Q2[.q]2 + ... + Q_n[.q]_n.  (35)\r\n  dt\r\n\r\nThis shows that mechanical energy is lost at the rate 2F per unit time.\r\nThe function F is therefore called by Lord Rayleigh the _dissipation\r\nfunction_.\r\n\r\nIf we omit the gyrostatic terms, and write q_r = C_re^([lambda]t), we\r\nfind, for a free vibration,\r\n\r\n  [a_(1r)[lambda]² + b_(1r)[lambda] + c_(1r)] C1 + [a_(2r)[lambda]² + b_(2r)[lambda] + c_(2r)] C2 + ...\r\n    + [a_(nr)[lambda]² + b_(nr)[lambda] + c_(nr)] C_n = 0.  (36)\r\n\r\nThis leads to a determinantal equation in [lambda] whose 2n roots are\r\neither real and negative, or complex with negative real parts, on the\r\npresent hypothesis that the functions T, V, F are all essentially\r\npositive. If we combine the solutions corresponding to a pair of\r\nconjugate complex roots, we obtain, in real form,\r\n\r\n  q_r = C[alpha]_re^(-t/[tau]) cos ([sigma]t + [epsilon] - [epsilon]_r),  (37)\r\n\r\nwhere [sigma], [tau], [alpha]_r, [epsilon]_r are determined by the\r\nconstitution of the system, whilst C, [epsilon] are arbitrary, and\r\nindependent of r. The n formulae of this type represent a normal mode of\r\nfree vibration: the individual particles revolve as a rule in elliptic\r\norbits which gradually contract according to the law indicated by the\r\nexponential factor. If the friction be relatively small, all the normal\r\nmodes are of this character, and unless two or more values of [sigma]\r\nare nearly equal the elliptic orbits are very elongated. The effect of\r\nfriction on the period is moreover of the second order.\r\n\r\nIn a forced vibration of e^(i[sigma]t) the variation of each co-ordinate\r\nis simple-harmonic, with the prescribed period, but there is a\r\nretardation of phase as compared with the force. If the friction be\r\nsmall the amplitude becomes relatively very great if the imposed period\r\napproximate to a free period. The validity of the \"reciprocal theorems\"\r\nof Helmholtz and Lord Rayleigh, already referred to, is not affected by\r\nfrictional forces of the kind here considered.\r\n\r\n  The most important applications of the theory of vibrations are to the\r\n  case of continuous systems such as strings, bars, membranes, plates,\r\n  columns of air, where the number of degrees of freedom is infinite.\r\n  The series of equations of the type (3) is then replaced by a single\r\n  linear partial differential equation, or by a set of two or three such\r\n  equations, according to the number of dependent variables. These\r\n  variables represent the whole assemblage of generalized co-ordinates\r\n  q_r; they are continuous functions of the independent variables x, y,\r\n  z whose range of variation corresponds to that of the index r, and of\r\n  t. For example, in a one-dimensional system such as a string or a bar,\r\n  we have one dependent variable, and two independent variables x and t.\r\n  To determine the free oscillations we assume a time factor\r\n  e^(i[sigma]t); the equations then become linear differential equations\r\n  between the dependent variables of the problem and the independent\r\n  variables x, or x, y, or x, y, z as the case may be. If the range of\r\n  the independent variable or variables is unlimited, the value of\r\n  [sigma] is at our disposal, and the solution gives us the laws of\r\n  wave-propagation (see WAVE). If, on the other hand, the body is\r\n  finite, certain terminal conditions have to be satisfied. These limit\r\n  the admissible values of [sigma], which are in general determined by\r\n  a transcendental equation corresponding to the determinantal equation\r\n  (6).\r\n\r\n  Numerous examples of this procedure, and of the corresponding\r\n  treatment of forced oscillations, present themselves in theoretical\r\n  acoustics. It must suffice here to consider the small oscillations of\r\n  a chain hanging vertically from a fixed extremity. If x be measured\r\n  upwards from the lower end, the horizontal component of the tension P\r\n  at any point will be P[delta]y/[delta]x, approximately, if y denote\r\n  the lateral displacement. Hence, forming the equation of motion of a\r\n  mass-element, [rho][delta]x, we have\r\n\r\n    [rho][delta]x·[:y] = [delta]P·([dP]y/[dP]x).  (38)\r\n\r\n  Neglecting the vertical acceleration we have P = g[rho]x, whence\r\n\r\n    [dP]²y     [dP]   /  [dP]y \\\r\n    ------ = g ----- ( x -----  ).  (39)\r\n    [dP]t²     [dP]x  \\  [dP]x /\r\n\r\n  Assuming that y varies as e^(i[sigma]t) we have\r\n\r\n    [dP]   /  [dP]y \\\r\n    ----- ( x -----  ) + ky = 0  (40)\r\n    [dP]x  \\  [dP]x /\r\n\r\n  provided k = [sigma]²/g. The solution of (40) which is finite for x =\r\n  0 is readily obtained in the form of a series, thus\r\n\r\n           /    kx    k²x²      \\\r\n    y = C ( 1 - -- +  ---- - ... ) = CJ0(z),  (41)\r\n           \\    1²    1²2²      /\r\n\r\n  in the notation of Bessel's functions, if z² = 4kx. Since y must\r\n  vanish at the upper end (x = l), the admissible values of [sigma] are\r\n  determined by\r\n\r\n    [sigma]² = gz²/4l, J0(z) = 0.  (42)\r\n\r\n  The function J0(z) has been tabulated; its lower roots are given by\r\n\r\n    z/[pi]= .7655, 1.7571, 2.7546,...,\r\n\r\n  approximately, where the numbers tend to the form s - ¼. The frequency\r\n  of the gravest mode is to that of a uniform bar in the ratio .9815\r\n  That this ratio should be less than unity agrees with the theory of\r\n  \"constrained types\" already given. In the higher normal modes there\r\n  are nodes or points of rest (y = 0); thus in the second mode there is\r\n  a node at a distance .190l from the lower end.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--For indications as to the earlier history of the subject\r\n  see W.

Lb.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--APPLIED MECHANICS[1]\r\n\r\n§ 1. The practical application of mechanics may be divided into two\r\nclasses, according as the assemblages of material objects to which they\r\nrelate are intended to remain fixed or to move relatively to each\r\nother--the former class being comprehended under the term \"Theory of\r\nStructures\" and the latter under the term \"Theory of Machines.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.--OUTLINE OF THE THEORY OF STRUCTURES\r\n\r\n  § 2. _Support of Structures._--Every structure, as a whole, is\r\n  maintained in equilibrium by the joint action of its own _weight_, of\r\n  the _external load_ or pressure applied to it from without and tending\r\n  to displace it, and of the _resistance_ of the material which supports\r\n  it. A structure is supported either by resting on the solid crust of\r\n  the earth, as buildings do, or by floating in a fluid, as ships do in\r\n  water and balloons in air. The principles of the support of a floating\r\n  structure form an important part of Hydromechanics (q.v.). The\r\n  principles of the support, as a whole, of a structure resting on the\r\n  land, are so far identical with those which regulate the equilibrium\r\n  and stability of the several parts of that structure that the only\r\n  principle which seems to require special mention here is one which\r\n  comprehends in one statement the power both of liquids and of loose\r\n  earth to support structures. This was first demonstrated in a paper\r\n  \"On the Stability of Loose Earth,\" read to the Royal Society on the\r\n  19th of June 1856 (Phil. _Trans._ 1856), as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Let E represent the weight of the portion of a horizontal stratum of\r\n  earth which is displaced by the foundation of a structure, S the\r\n  utmost weight of that structure consistently with the power of the\r\n  earth to resist displacement, [phi] the angle of repose of the earth;\r\n  then\r\n\r\n     S     /1 + sin[phi]\\²\r\n    --- = ( ------------ ).\r\n     E     \\1 - sin[phi]/\r\n\r\n  To apply this to liquids [phi] must be made zero, and then S/E = 1, as\r\n  is well known. For a proof of this expression see Rankine's _Applied\r\n  Mechanics_, 17th ed., p. 219.\r\n\r\n  § 3. _Composition of a Structure, and Connexion of its Pieces._--A\r\n  structure is composed of _pieces_,--such as the stones of a building\r\n  in masonry, the beams of a timber framework, the bars, plates and\r\n  bolts of an iron bridge. Those pieces are connected at their joints or\r\n  surfaces of mutual contact, either by simple pressure and friction (as\r\n  in masonry with moist mortar or without mortar), by pressure and\r\n  adhesion (as in masonry with cement or with hardened mortar, and\r\n  timber with glue), or by the resistance of _fastenings_ of different\r\n  kinds, whether made by means of the form of the joint (as dovetails,\r\n  notches, mortices and tenons) or by separate fastening pieces (as\r\n  trenails, pins, spikes, nails, holdfasts, screws, bolts, rivets,\r\n  hoops, straps and sockets.)\r\n\r\n  § 4. _Stability, Stiffness and Strength._--A structure may be damaged\r\n  or destroyed in three ways:--first, by displacement of its pieces from\r\n  their proper positions relatively to each other or to the earth;\r\n  secondly by disfigurement of one or more of those pieces, owing to\r\n  their being unable to preserve their proper shapes under the pressures\r\n  to which they are subjected; thirdly, by _breaking_ of one or more of\r\n  those pieces. The power of resisting displacement constitutes\r\n  stability, the power of each piece to resist disfigurement is its\r\n  _stiffness_; and its power to resist breaking, its _strength_.\r\n\r\n  § 5. _Conditions of Stability._--The principles of the stability of a\r\n  structure can be to a certain extent investigated independently of the\r\n  stiffness and strength, by assuming, in the first instance, that each\r\n  piece has strength sufficient to be safe against being broken, and\r\n  stiffness sufficient to prevent its being disfigured to an extent\r\n  inconsistent with the purposes of the structure, by the greatest\r\n  forces which are to be applied to it. The condition that each piece of\r\n  the structure is to be maintained in equilibrium by having its gross\r\n  load, consisting of its own weight and of the external pressure\r\n  applied to it, balanced by the _resistances_ or pressures exerted\r\n  between it and the contiguous pieces, furnishes the means of\r\n  determining the magnitude, position and direction of the resistances\r\n  required at each joint in order to produce equilibrium; and the\r\n  _conditions of stability_ are, first, that the _position_, and,\r\n  secondly, that the _direction_, of the resistance required at each\r\n  joint shall, under all the variations to which the load is subject, be\r\n  such as the joint is capable of exerting--conditions which are\r\n  fulfilled by suitably adjusting the figures and positions of the\r\n  joints, and the _ratios_ of the gross loads of the pieces. As for the\r\n  _magnitude_ of the resistance, it is limited by conditions, not of\r\n  stability, but of strength and stiffness.\r\n\r\n  § 6. _Principle of Least Resistance._--Where more than one system of\r\n  resistances are alike capable of balancing the same system of loads\r\n  applied to a given structure, the _smallest_ of those alternative\r\n  systems, as was demonstrated by the Rev. Henry Moseley in his\r\n  _Mechanics of Engineering and Architecture_, is that which will\r\n  actually be exerted--because the resistances to displacement are the\r\n  effect of a strained state of the pieces, which strained state is the\r\n  effect of the load, and when the load is applied the strained state\r\n  and the resistances produced by it increase until the resistances\r\n  acquire just those magnitudes which are sufficient to balance the\r\n  load, after which they increase no further.\r\n\r\n  This principle of least resistance renders determinate many problems\r\n  in the statics of structures which were formerly considered\r\n  indeterminate.\r\n\r\n  § 7. _Relations between Polygons of Loads and of Resistances._--In a\r\n  structure in which each piece is supported at two joints only, the\r\n  well-known laws of statics show that the directions of the gross load\r\n  on each piece and of the two resistances by which it is supported must\r\n  lie in one plane, must either be parallel or meet in one point, and\r\n  must bear to each other, if not parallel, the proportions of the sides\r\n  of a triangle respectively parallel to their directions, and, if\r\n  parallel, such proportions that each of the three forces shall be\r\n  proportional to the distance between the other two,--all the three\r\n  distances being measured along one direction.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 86.]\r\n\r\n  Considering, in the first place, the case in which the load and the\r\n  two resistances by which each piece is balanced meet in one point,\r\n  which may be called the _centre of load_, there will be as many such\r\n  points of intersection, or centres of load, as there are pieces in the\r\n  structure; and the directions and positions of the resistances or\r\n  mutual pressures exerted between the pieces will be represented by the\r\n  sides of a polygon joining those points, as in fig. 86 where P1, P2,\r\n  P3, P4 represent the centres of load in a structure of four pieces,\r\n  and the sides of the _polygon of resistances_ P1 P2 P3 P4 represent\r\n  respectively the directions and positions of the resistances exerted\r\n  at the joints. Further, at any one of the centres of load let PL\r\n  represent the magnitude and direction of the gross load, and Pa, Pb\r\n  the two resistances by which the piece to which that load is applied\r\n  is supported; then will those three lines be respectively the diagonal\r\n  and sides of a parallelogram; or, what is the same thing, they will be\r\n  equal to the three sides of a triangle; and they must be in the same\r\n  plane, although the sides of the polygon of resistances may be in\r\n  different planes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 87.]\r\n\r\n  According to a well-known principle of statics, because the loads or\r\n  external pressures P1L1, &c., balance each other, they must be\r\n  proportional to the sides of a closed polygon drawn respectively\r\n  parallel to their directions. In fig. 87 construct such a _polygon of\r\n  loads_ by drawing the lines L1, &c., parallel and proportional to, and\r\n  joined end to end in the order of, the gross loads on the pieces of\r\n  the structure. Then from the proportionality and parallelism of the\r\n  load and the two resistances applied to each piece of the structure to\r\n  the three sides of a triangle, there results the following theorem\r\n  (originally due to Rankine):--\r\n\r\n  _If from the angles of the polygon of loads there be drawn lines (R1,\r\n  R2, &c.), each of which is parallel to the resistance (as P1P2, &c.)\r\n  exerted at the joint between the pieces to which the two loads\r\n  represented by the contiguous sides of the polygon of loads (such as\r\n  L1, L2, &c.) are applied; then will all those lines meet in one point\r\n  (O), and their lengths, measured from that point to the angles of the\r\n  polygon, will represent the magnitudes of the resistances to which\r\n  they are respectively parallel._\r\n\r\n  When the load on one of the pieces is parallel to the resistances\r\n  which balance it, the polygon of resistances ceases to be closed, two\r\n  of the sides becoming parallel to each other and to the load in\r\n  question, and extending indefinitely. In the polygon of loads the\r\n  direction of a load sustained by parallel resistances traverses the\r\n  point O.[2]\r\n\r\n  § 8. _How the Earth's Resistance is to be treated_.... When the\r\n  pressure exerted by a structure on the earth (to which the earth's\r\n  resistance is equal and opposite) consists either of one pressure,\r\n  which is necessarily the resultant of the weight of the structure and\r\n  of all the other forces applied to it, or of two or more parallel\r\n  vertical forces, whose amount can be determined at the outset of the\r\n  investigation, the resistance of the earth can be treated as one or\r\n  more upward loads applied to the structure. But in other cases the\r\n  earth is to be treated as _one of the pieces of the structure_, loaded\r\n  with a force equal and opposite in direction and position to the\r\n  resultant of the weight of the structure and of the other pressures\r\n  applied to it.\r\n\r\n  § 9. _Partial Polygons of Resistance._--In a structure in which there\r\n  are pieces supported at more than two joints, let a polygon be\r\n  constructed of lines connecting the centres of load of any continuous\r\n  series of pieces. This may be called a _partial polygon of\r\n  resistances_. In considering its properties, the load at each centre\r\n  of load is to be held to _include_ the resistances of those joints\r\n  which are not comprehended in the partial polygon of resistances, to\r\n  which the theorem of § 7 will then apply in every respect. By\r\n  constructing several partial polygons, and computing the relations\r\n  between the loads and resistances which are determined by the\r\n  application of that theorem to each of them, with the aid, if\r\n  necessary, of Moseley's principle of the least resistance, the whole\r\n  of the relations amongst the loads and resistances may be found.\r\n\r\n  § 10. _Line of Pressures--Centres and Line of Resistance._--The line\r\n  of pressures is a line to which the directions of all the resistances\r\n  in one polygon are tangents. The _centre of resistance_ at any joint\r\n  is the point where the line representing the total resistance exerted\r\n  at that joint intersects the joint. The _line of resistance_ is a line\r\n  traversing all the centres of resistance of a series of joints,--its\r\n  form, in the positions intermediate between the actual joints of the\r\n  structure, being determined by supposing the pieces and their loads to\r\n  be subdivided by the introduction of intermediate joints _ad\r\n  infinitum_, and finding the continuous line, curved or straight, in\r\n  which the intermediate centres of resistance are all situated, however\r\n  great their number. The difference between the line of resistance and\r\n  the line of pressures was first pointed out by Moseley.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 88.]\r\n\r\n  § 11.* The principles of the two preceding sections may be illustrated\r\n  by the consideration of a particular case of a buttress of blocks\r\n  forming a continuous series of pieces (fig. 88), where aa, bb, cc, dd\r\n  represent plane joints. Let the centre of pressure C at the first\r\n  joint aa be known, and also the pressure P acting at C in direction\r\n  and magnitude. Find R1 the resultant of this pressure, the weight of\r\n  the block aabb acting through its centre of gravity, and any other\r\n  external force which may be acting on the block, and produce its line\r\n  of action to cut the joint bb in C1. C1 is then the centre of pressure\r\n  for the joint bb, and R1 is the total force acting there. Repeating\r\n  this process for each block in succession there will be found the\r\n  centres of pressure C2, C3, &c., and also the resultant pressures R2,\r\n  R3, &c., acting at these respective centres. The centres of pressure\r\n  at the joints are also called _centres of resistance_, and the curve\r\n  passing through these points is called a _line of resistance_. Let all\r\n  the resultants acting at the several centres of resistance be produced\r\n  until they cut one another in a series of points so as to form an\r\n  unclosed polygon. This polygon is the _partial polygon of resistance_.\r\n  A curve tangential to all the sides of the polygon is the _line of\r\n  pressures_.\r\n\r\n  § 12. _Stability of Position, and Stability of Friction._--The\r\n  resistances at the several joints having been determined by the\r\n  principles set forth in §§ 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, not only under the\r\n  ordinary load of the structure, but under all the variations to which\r\n  the load is subject as to amount and distribution, the joints are now\r\n  to be placed and shaped so that the pieces shall not suffer relative\r\n  displacement under any of those loads. The relative displacement of\r\n  the two pieces which abut against each other at a joint may take place\r\n  either by turning or by sliding. Safety against displacement by\r\n  turning is called _stability of position_; safety against displacement\r\n  by sliding, _stability of friction_.\r\n\r\n  § 13. _Condition of Stability of Position._--If the materials of a\r\n  structure were infinitely stiff and strong, stability of position at\r\n  any joint would be insured simply by making the centre of resistance\r\n  fall within the joint under all possible variations of load. In order\r\n  to allow for the finite stiffness and strength of materials, the least\r\n  distance of the centre of resistance inward from the nearest edge of\r\n  the joint is made to bear a definite proportion to the depth of the\r\n  joint measured in the same direction, which proportion is fixed,\r\n  sometimes empirically, sometimes by theoretical deduction from the\r\n  laws of the strength of materials. That least distance is called by\r\n  Moseley the _modulus of stability_. The following are some of the\r\n  ratios of the modulus of stability to the depth of the joint which\r\n  occur in practice:--\r\n\r\n    Retaining walls, as designed by British engineers                1:8\r\n    Retaining walls, as designed by French engineers                 1:5\r\n    Rectangular piers of bridges and other buildings, and\r\n      arch-stones                                                    1:3\r\n    Rectangular foundations, firm ground                             1:3\r\n    Rectangular foundations, very soft ground                        1:2\r\n    Rectangular foundations, intermediate kinds of ground     1:3 to 1:2\r\n    Thin, hollow towers (such as furnace chimneys exposed\r\n      to high winds), square                                         1:6\r\n    Thin, hollow towers, circular                                    1:4\r\n    Frames of timber or metal, under their ordinary or\r\n      average distribution of load                                   1:3\r\n    Frames of timber or metal, under the greatest\r\n      irregularities of load                                         1:3\r\n\r\n  In the case of the towers, the _depth of the joint_ is to be\r\n  understood to mean the _diameter of the tower_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 89.]\r\n\r\n  § 14. _Condition of Stability of Friction._--If the resistance to be\r\n  exerted at a joint is always perpendicular to the surfaces which abut\r\n  at and form that joint, there is no tendency of the pieces to be\r\n  displaced by sliding. If the resistance be oblique, let JK (fig. 89)\r\n  be the joint, C its centre of resistance, CR a line representing the\r\n  resistance, CN a perpendicular to the joint at the centre of\r\n  resistance. The angle NCR is the _obliquity_ of the resistance. From R\r\n  draw RP parallel and RQ perpendicular to the joint; then, by the\r\n  principles of statics, the component of the resistance _normal_ to the\r\n  joint is--\r\n\r\n    CP = CR · cos PCR;\r\n\r\n  and the component _tangential_ to the joint is--\r\n\r\n    CQ = CR · sin PCR = CP · tan PCR.\r\n\r\n  If the joint be provided either with projections and recesses, such as\r\n  mortises and tenons, or with fastenings, such as pins or bolts, so as\r\n  to resist displacement by sliding, the question of the utmost amount\r\n  of the tangential resistance CQ which it is capable of exerting\r\n  depends on the _strength_ of such projections, recesses, or\r\n  fastenings; and belongs to the subject of strength, and not to that of\r\n  stability. In other cases the safety of the joint against displacement\r\n  by sliding depends on its power of exerting friction, and that power\r\n  depends on the law, known by experiment, that the friction between two\r\n  surfaces bears a constant ratio, depending on the nature of the\r\n  surfaces, to the force by which they are pressed together. In order\r\n  that the surfaces which abut at the joint JK may be pressed together,\r\n  the resistance required by the conditions of equilibrium CR, must be a\r\n  _thrust_ and not a _pull_; and in that case the force by which the\r\n  surfaces are pressed together is equal and opposite to the normal\r\n  component CP of the resistance. The condition of stability of friction\r\n  is that the tangential component CQ of the resistance required shall\r\n  not exceed the friction due to the normal component; that is, that\r\n\r\n    CQ [/>] f · CP,\r\n\r\n  where f denotes the _coefficient of friction_ for the surfaces in\r\n  question. The angle whose tangent is the coefficient of friction is\r\n  called _the angle of repose_, and is expressed symbolically by--\r\n\r\n    [phi] = tan^-1 f.\r\n\r\n    Now CQ = CP · tan PCR;\r\n\r\n  consequently the condition of stability of friction is fulfilled if\r\n  the angle PCR is not greater than [phi]; that is to say, if _the\r\n  obliquity of the resistance required at the joint does not exceed the\r\n  angle of repose_; and this condition ought to be fulfilled under all\r\n  possible variations of the load.\r\n\r\n  It is chiefly in masonry and earthwork that stability of friction is\r\n  relied on.\r\n\r\n  § 15. _Stability of Friction in Earth._--The grains of a mass of loose\r\n  earth are to be regarded as so many separate pieces abutting against\r\n  each other at joints in all possible positions, and depending for\r\n  their stability on friction. To determine whether a mass of earth is\r\n  stable at a given point, conceive that point to be traversed by planes\r\n  in all possible positions, and determine which position gives the\r\n  greatest obliquity to the total pressure exerted between the portions\r\n  of the mass which abut against each other at the plane. The condition\r\n  of stability is that this obliquity shall not exceed the angle of\r\n  repose of the earth. The consequences of this principle are developed\r\n  in a paper, \"On the Stability of Loose Earth,\" already cited in § 2.\r\n\r\n  § 16. _Parallel Projections of Figures._--If any figure be referred to\r\n  a system of co-ordinates, rectangular or oblique, and if a second\r\n  figure be constructed by means of a second system of co-ordinates,\r\n  rectangular or oblique, and either agreeing with or differing from the\r\n  first system in rectangularity or obliquity, but so related to the\r\n  co-ordinates of the first figure that for each point in the first\r\n  figure there shall be a corresponding point in the second figure, the\r\n  lengths of whose co-ordinates shall bear respectively to the three\r\n  corresponding co-ordinates of the corresponding point in the first\r\n  figure three ratios which are the same for every pair of corresponding\r\n  points in the two figures, these corresponding figures are called\r\n  _parallel projections_ of each other. The properties of parallel\r\n  projections of most importance to the subject of the present article\r\n  are the following:--\r\n\r\n  (1) A parallel projection of a straight line is a straight line.\r\n\r\n  (2) A parallel projection of a plane is a plane.\r\n\r\n  (3) A parallel projection of a straight line or a plane surface\r\n  divided in a given ratio is a straight line or a plane surface divided\r\n  in the same ratio.\r\n\r\n  (4) A parallel projection of a pair of equal and parallel straight\r\n  lines, or plain surfaces, is a pair of equal and parallel straight lines,\r\n  or plane surfaces; whence it follows\r\n\r\n  (5) That a parallel projection of a parallelogram is a parallelogram,\r\n  and\r\n\r\n  (6) That a parallel projection of a parallelepiped is a parallelepiped.\r\n\r\n  (7) A parallel projection of a pair of solids having a given ratio\r\n  is a pair of solids having the same ratio.\r\n\r\n  Though not essential for the purposes of the present article, the\r\n  following consequence will serve to illustrate the principle of\r\n  parallel projections:--\r\n\r\n  (8) A parallel projection of a curve, or of a surface of a given\r\n  algebraical order, is a curve or a surface of the same order.\r\n\r\n  For example, all ellipsoids referred to co-ordinates parallel to any\r\n  three conjugate diameters are parallel projections of each other and\r\n  of a sphere referred to rectangular co-ordinates.\r\n\r\n  § 17. _Parallel Projections of Systems of Forces._--If a balanced\r\n  system of forces be represented by a system of lines, then will every\r\n  parallel projection of that system of lines represent a balanced\r\n  system of forces.\r\n\r\n  For the condition of equilibrium of forces not parallel is that they\r\n  shall be represented in direction and magnitude by the sides and\r\n  diagonals of certain parallelograms, and of parallel forces that they\r\n  shall divide certain straight lines in certain ratios; and the\r\n  parallel projection of a parallelogram is a parallelogram, and that of\r\n  a straight line divided in a given ratio is a straight line divided in\r\n  the same ratio.\r\n\r\n  The resultant of a parallel projection of any system of forces is the\r\n  projection of their resultant; and the centre of gravity of a parallel\r\n  projection of a solid is the projection of the centre of gravity of\r\n  the first solid.\r\n\r\n  § 18. _Principle of the Transformation of Structures._--Here we have\r\n  the following theorem: If a structure of a given figure have stability\r\n  of position under a system of forces represented by a given system of\r\n  lines, then will any structure whose figure is a parallel projection\r\n  of that of the first structure have stability of position under a\r\n  system of forces represented by the corresponding projection of the\r\n  first system of lines.\r\n\r\n  For in the second structure the weights, external pressures, and\r\n  resistances will balance each other as in the first structure; the\r\n  weights of the pieces and all other parallel systems of forces will\r\n  have the same ratios as in the first structure; and the several\r\n  centres of resistance will divide the depths of the joints in the same\r\n  proportions as in the first structure.\r\n\r\n  If the first structure have stability of friction, the second\r\n  structure will have stability of friction also, so long as the effect\r\n  of the projection is not to increase the obliquity of the resistance\r\n  at any joint beyond the angle of repose.\r\n\r\n  The lines representing the forces in the second figure show their\r\n  _relative_ directions and magnitudes. To find their _absolute_\r\n  directions and magnitudes, a vertical line is to be drawn in the first\r\n  figure, of such a length as to represent the weight of a particular\r\n  portion of the structure. Then will the projection of that line in the\r\n  projected figure indicate the vertical direction, and represent the\r\n  weight of the part of the second structure corresponding to the\r\n  before-mentioned portion of the first structure.\r\n\r\n  The foregoing \"principle of the transformation of structures\" was\r\n  first announced, though in a somewhat less comprehensive form, to the\r\n  Royal Society on the 6th of March 1856. It is useful in practice, by\r\n  enabling the engineer easily to deduce the conditions of equilibrium\r\n  and stability of structures of complex and unsymmetrical figures from\r\n  those of structures of simple and symmetrical figures. By its aid, for\r\n  example, the whole of the properties of elliptical arches, whether\r\n  square or skew, whether level or sloping in their span, are at once\r\n  deduced by projection from those of symmetrical circular arches, and\r\n  the properties of ellipsoidal and elliptic-conoidal domes from those\r\n  of hemispherical and circular-conoidal domes; and the figures of\r\n  arches fitted to resist the thrust of earth, which is less\r\n  horizontally than vertically in a certain given ratio, can be deduced\r\n  by a projection from those of arches fitted to resist the thrust of a\r\n  liquid, which is of equal intensity, horizontally and vertically.\r\n\r\n  § 19. _Conditions of Stiffness and Strength._--After the arrangement\r\n  of the pieces of a structure and the size and figure of their joints\r\n  or surfaces of contact have been determined so as to fulfil the\r\n  conditions of _stability_,--conditions which depend mainly on the\r\n  position and direction of the _resultant_ or _total_ load on each\r\n  piece, and the _relative_ magnitude of the loads on the different\r\n  pieces--the dimensions of each piece singly have to be adjusted so as\r\n  to fulfil the conditions of _stiffness_ and _strength_--conditions\r\n  which depend not only on the _absolute_ magnitude of the load on each\r\n  piece, and of the resistances by which it is balanced, but also on the\r\n  _mode of distribution_ of the load over the piece, and of the\r\n  resistances over the joints.\r\n\r\n  The effect of the pressures applied to a piece, consisting of the load\r\n  and the supporting resistances, is to force the piece into a state of\r\n  _strain_ or disfigurement, which increases until the elasticity, or\r\n  resistance to strain, of the material causes it to exert a _stress_,\r\n  or effort to recover its figure, equal and opposite to the system of\r\n  applied pressures. The condition of _stiffness_ is that the strain or\r\n  disfigurement shall not be greater than is consistent with the\r\n  purposes of the structure; and the condition of _strength_ is that the\r\n  stress shall be within the limits of that which the material can bear\r\n  with safety against breaking. The ratio in which the utmost stress\r\n  before breaking exceeds the safe working stress is called the _factor\r\n  of safety_, and is determined empirically. It varies from three to\r\n  twelve for various materials and structures. (See STRENGTH OF\r\n  MATERIALS.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART II. THEORY OF MACHINES\r\n\r\n  § 20. _Parts of a Machine: Frame and Mechanism._--The parts of a\r\n  machine may be distinguished into two principal divisions,--the frame,\r\n  or fixed parts, and the _mechanism_, or moving parts. The frame is a\r\n  structure which supports the pieces of the mechanism, and to a certain\r\n  extent determines the nature of their motions.\r\n\r\n  The form and arrangement of the pieces of the frame depend upon the\r\n  arrangement and the motions of the mechanism; the dimensions of the\r\n  pieces of the frame required in order to give it stability and\r\n  strength are determined from the pressures applied to it by means of\r\n  the mechanism. It appears therefore that in general the mechanism is\r\n  to be designed first and the frame afterwards, and that the designing\r\n  of the frame is regulated by the principles of the stability of\r\n  structures and of the strength and stiffness of materials,--care being\r\n  taken to adapt the frame to the most severe load which can be thrown\r\n  upon it at any period of the action of the mechanism.\r\n\r\n  Each independent piece of the mechanism also is a structure, and its\r\n  dimensions are to be adapted, according to the principles of the\r\n  strength and stiffness of materials, to the most severe load to which\r\n  it can be subjected during the action of the machine.\r\n\r\n  § 21. _Definition and Division of the Theory of Machines._--From what\r\n  has been said in the last section it appears that the department of\r\n  the art of designing machines which has reference to the stability of\r\n  the frame and to the stiffness and strength of the frame and mechanism\r\n  is a branch of the art of construction. It is therefore to be\r\n  separated from the _theory of machines_, properly speaking, which has\r\n  reference to the action of machines considered as moving. In the\r\n  action of a machine the following three things take place:--\r\n\r\n  _Firstly_, Some natural source of energy communicates motion and force\r\n  to a piece or pieces of the mechanism, called the _receiver of power_\r\n  or _prime mover_.\r\n\r\n  _Secondly_, The motion and force are transmitted from the prime mover\r\n  through the _train of mechanism_ to the _working piece_ or _pieces_,\r\n  and during that transmission the motion and force are modified in\r\n  amount and direction, so as to be rendered suitable for the purpose to\r\n  which they are to be applied.\r\n\r\n  _Thirdly_, The working piece or pieces by their motion, or by their\r\n  motion and force combined, produce some useful effect.\r\n\r\n  Such are the phenomena of the action of a machine, arranged in the\r\n  order of _causation_. But in studying or treating of the theory of\r\n  machines, the order of _simplicity_ is the best; and in this order the\r\n  first branch of the subject is the modification of motion and force by\r\n  the train of mechanism; the next is the effect or purpose of the\r\n  machine; and the last, or most complex, is the action of the prime\r\n  mover.\r\n\r\n  The modification of motion and the modification of force take place\r\n  together, and are connected by certain laws; but in the study of the\r\n  theory of machines, as well as in that of pure mechanics, much\r\n  advantage has been gained in point of clearness and simplicity by\r\n  first considering alone the principles of the modification of motion,\r\n  which are founded upon what is now known as Kinematics, and afterwards\r\n  considering the principles of the combined modification of motion and\r\n  force, which are founded both on geometry and on the laws of dynamics.\r\n  The separation of kinematics from dynamics is due mainly to G. Monge,\r\n  Ampère and R. Willis.\r\n\r\n  The theory of machines in the present article will be considered under\r\n  the following heads:--\r\n\r\n  I. PURE MECHANISM, or APPLIED KINEMATICS; being the theory of machines\r\n  considered simply as modifying motion.\r\n\r\n  II. APPLIED DYNAMICS; being the theory of machines considered as\r\n  modifying both motion and force.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP. I. ON PURE MECHANISM\r\n\r\n  § 22. _Division of the Subject._--Proceeding in the order of\r\n  simplicity, the subject of Pure Mechanism, or Applied Kinematics, may\r\n  be thus divided:--\r\n\r\n  _Division 1._--Motion of a point.\r\n\r\n  _Division 2._--Motion of the surface of a fluid.\r\n\r\n  _Division 3._--Motion of a rigid solid.\r\n\r\n  _Division 4._--Motions of a pair of connected pieces, or of an\r\n    \"elementary combination\" in mechanism.\r\n\r\n  _Division 5._--Motions of trains of pieces of mechanism.\r\n\r\n  _Division 6._--Motions of sets of more than two connected pieces, or of\r\n    \"aggregate combinations.\"\r\n\r\n  A point is the boundary of a line, which is the boundary of a surface,\r\n  which is the boundary of a volume. Points, lines and surfaces have no\r\n  independent existence, and consequently those divisions of this\r\n  chapter which relate to their motions are only preliminary to the\r\n  subsequent divisions, which relate to the motions of bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Division 1. Motion of a Point._\r\n\r\n  § 23. _Comparative Motion._--The comparative motion of two points is\r\n  the relation which exists between their motions, without having regard\r\n  to their absolute amounts. It consists of two elements,--the _velocity\r\n  ratio_, which is the ratio of any two magnitudes bearing to each other\r\n  the proportions of the respective velocities of the two points at a\r\n  given instant, and the _directional relation_, which is the relation\r\n  borne to each other by the respective directions of the motions of the\r\n  two points at the same given instant.\r\n\r\n  It is obvious that the motions of a pair of points may be varied in\r\n  any manner, whether by direct or by lateral deviation, and yet that\r\n  their _comparative motion_ may remain constant, in consequence of the\r\n  deviations taking place in the same proportions, in the same\r\n  directions and at the same instants for both points.\r\n\r\n  Robert Willis (1800-1875) has the merit of having been the first to\r\n  simplify considerably the theory of pure mechanism, by pointing out\r\n  that that branch of mechanics relates wholly to comparative motions.\r\n\r\n  The comparative motion of two points at a given instant is capable of\r\n  being completely expressed by one of Sir William Hamilton's\r\n  Quaternions,--the \"tensor\" expressing the velocity ratio, and the\r\n  \"versor\" the directional relation.\r\n\r\n  Graphical methods of analysis founded on this way of representing\r\n  velocity and acceleration were developed by R. H. Smith in a paper\r\n  communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1885, and\r\n  illustrations of the method will be found below.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Division 2. Motion of the Surface of a Fluid Mass._\r\n\r\n  § 24. _General Principle._--A mass of fluid is used in mechanism to\r\n  transmit motion and force between two or more movable portions (called\r\n  _pistons_ or _plungers_) of the solid envelope or vessel in which the\r\n  fluid is contained; and, when such transmission is the sole action, or\r\n  the only appreciable action of the fluid mass, its volume is either\r\n  absolutely constant, by reason of its temperature and pressure being\r\n  maintained constant, or not sensibly varied.\r\n\r\n  Let a represent the area of the section of a piston made by a plane\r\n  perpendicular to its direction of motion, and v its velocity, which is\r\n  to be considered as positive when outward, and negative when inward.\r\n  Then the variation of the cubic contents of the vessel in a unit of\r\n  time by reason of the motion of one piston is va. The condition that\r\n  the volume of the fluid mass shall remain unchanged requires that\r\n  there shall be more than one piston, and that the velocities and areas\r\n  of the pistons shall be connected by the equation--\r\n\r\n    [Sigma]·va = 0.  (1)\r\n\r\n  § 25. _Comparative Motion of Two Pistons._--If there be but two\r\n  pistons, whose areas are a1 and a2, and their velocities v1 and v2,\r\n  their comparative motion is expressed by the equation--\r\n\r\n    v2/v1 = -a1/a2;  (2)\r\n\r\n  that is to say, their velocities are opposite as to inwardness and\r\n  outwardness and inversely proportional to their areas.\r\n\r\n  § 26. _Applications: Hydraulic Press: Pneumatic\r\n  Power-Transmitter._--In the hydraulic press the vessel consists of two\r\n  cylinders, viz. the pump-barrel and the press-barrel, each having its\r\n  piston, and of a passage connecting them having a valve opening\r\n  towards the press-barrel. The action of the enclosed water in\r\n  transmitting motion takes place during the inward stroke of the\r\n  pump-plunger, when the above-mentioned valve is open; and at that time\r\n  the press-plunger moves outwards with a velocity which is less than\r\n  the inward velocity of the pump-plunger, in the same ratio that the\r\n  area of the pump-plunger is less than the area of the press-plunger.\r\n  (See HYDRAULICS.)\r\n\r\n  In the pneumatic power-transmitter the motion of one piston is\r\n  transmitted to another at a distance by means of a mass of air\r\n  contained in two cylinders and an intervening tube. When the pressure\r\n  and temperature of the air can be maintained constant, this machine\r\n  fulfils equation (2), like the hydraulic press. The amount and effect\r\n  of the variations of pressure and temperature undergone by the air\r\n  depend on the principles of the mechanical action of heat, or\r\n  THERMODYNAMICS (q.v.), and are foreign to the subject of pure\r\n  mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Division 3. Motion of a Rigid Solid._\r\n\r\n  § 27. _Motions Classed._--In problems of mechanism, each solid piece\r\n  of the machine is supposed to be so stiff and strong as not to undergo\r\n  any sensible change of figure or dimensions by the forces applied to\r\n  it--a supposition which is realized in practice if the machine is\r\n  skilfully designed.\r\n\r\n  This being the case, the various possible motions of a rigid solid\r\n  body may all be classed under the following heads: (1) _Shifting or\r\n  Translation_; (2) _Turning or Rotation_; (3) _Motions compounded of\r\n  Shifting and Turning_.\r\n\r\n  The most common forms for the paths of the points of a piece of\r\n  mechanism, whose motion is simple shifting, are the straight line and\r\n  the circle.\r\n\r\n  Shifting in a straight line is regulated either by straight fixed\r\n  guides, in contact with which the moving piece slides, or by\r\n  combinations of link-work, called _parallel motions_, which will be\r\n  described in the sequel. Shifting in a straight line is usually\r\n  _reciprocating_; that is to say, the piece, after shifting through a\r\n  certain distance, returns to its original position by reversing its\r\n  motion.\r\n\r\n  Circular shifting is regulated by attaching two or more points of the\r\n  shifting piece to ends of equal and parallel rotating cranks, or by\r\n  combinations of wheel-work to be afterwards described. As an example\r\n  of circular shifting may be cited the motion of the coupling rod, by\r\n  which the parallel and equal cranks upon two or more axles of a\r\n  locomotive engine are connected and made to rotate simultaneously. The\r\n  coupling rod remains always parallel to itself, and all its points\r\n  describe equal and similar circles relatively to the frame of the\r\n  engine, and move in parallel directions with equal velocities at the\r\n  same instant.\r\n\r\n  § 28. _Rotation about a Fixed Axis: Lever, Wheel and Axle._--The fixed\r\n  axis of a turning body is a line fixed relatively to the body and\r\n  relatively to the fixed space in which the body turns. In mechanism it\r\n  is usually the central line either of a rotating shaft or axle having\r\n  journals, gudgeons, or pivots turning in fixed bearings, or of a fixed\r\n  spindle or dead centre round which a rotating bush turns; but it may\r\n  sometimes be entirely beyond the limits of the turning body. For\r\n  example, if a sliding piece moves in circular fixed guides, that piece\r\n  rotates about an ideal fixed axis traversing the centre of those\r\n  guides.\r\n\r\n  Let the angular velocity of the rotation be denoted by [alpha] =\r\n  d[theta]/dt, then the linear velocity of any point A at the distance r\r\n  from the axis is [alpha]r; and the path of that point is a circle of\r\n  the radius r described about the axis.\r\n\r\n  This is the principle of the modification of motion by the lever,\r\n  which consists of a rigid body turning about a fixed axis called a\r\n  fulcrum, and having two points at the same or different distances from\r\n  that axis, and in the same or different directions, one of which\r\n  receives motion and the other transmits motion, modified in direction\r\n  and velocity according to the above law.\r\n\r\n  In the wheel and axle, motion is received and transmitted by two\r\n  cylindrical surfaces of different radii described about their common\r\n  fixed axis of turning, their velocity-ratio being that of their radii.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 90.]\r\n\r\n  § 29. _Velocity Ratio of Components of Motion._--As the distance\r\n  between any two points in a rigid body is invariable, the projections\r\n  of their velocities upon the line joining them must be equal. Hence it\r\n  follows that, if A in fig. 90 be a point in a rigid body CD, rotating\r\n  round the fixed axis F, the component of the velocity of A in any\r\n  direction AP parallel to the plane of rotation is equal to the total\r\n  velocity of the point m, found by letting fall Fm perpendicular to AP;\r\n  that is to say, is equal to\r\n\r\n    [alpha]·Fm.\r\n\r\n  Hence also the ratio of the components of the velocities of two points\r\n  A and B in the directions AP and BW respectively, both in the plane of\r\n  rotation, is equal to the ratio of the perpendiculars Fm and Fn.\r\n\r\n  § 30. _Instantaneous Axis of a Cylinder rolling on a Cylinder._--Let a\r\n  cylinder bbb, whose axis of figure is B and angular velocity [gamma],\r\n  roll on a fixed cylinder [alpha][alpha][alpha], whose axis of figure\r\n  is A, either outside (as in fig. 91), when the rolling will be towards\r\n  the same hand as the rotation, or inside (as in fig. 92), when the\r\n  rolling will be towards the opposite hand; and at a given instant let\r\n  T be the line of contact of the two cylindrical surfaces, which is at\r\n  their common intersection with the plane AB traversing the two axes of\r\n  figure.\r\n\r\n  The line T on the surface bbb has for the instant no velocity in a\r\n  direction perpendicular to AB; because for the instant it touches,\r\n  without sliding, the line T on the fixed surface aaa.\r\n\r\n  The line T on the surface bbb has also for the instant no velocity in\r\n  the plane AB; for it has just ceased to move towards the fixed surface\r\n  aaa, and is just about to begin to move away from that surface.\r\n\r\n  The line of contact T, therefore, on the surface of the cylinder bbb,\r\n  is _for the instant_ at rest, and is the \"instantaneous axis\" about\r\n  which the cylinder bbb turns, together with any body rigidly attached\r\n  to that cylinder.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 91.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 92.]\r\n\r\n  To find, then, the direction and velocity at the given instant of any\r\n  point P, either in or rigidly attached to the rolling cylinder T, draw\r\n  the plane PT; the direction of motion of P will be perpendicular to\r\n  that plane, and towards the right or left hand according to the\r\n  direction of the rotation of bbb; and the velocity of P will be\r\n\r\n    v_P = [gamma]·PT,  (3)\r\n\r\n  PT denoting the perpendicular distance of P from T. The path of P is a\r\n  curve of the kind called _epitrochoids_. If P is in the circumference\r\n  of bbb, that path becomes an _epicycloid_.\r\n\r\n  The velocity of any point in the axis of figure B is\r\n\r\n    v_B = [gamma]·TB;  (4)\r\n\r\n  and the path of such a point is a circle described about A with the\r\n  radius AB, being for outside rolling the sum, and for inside rolling\r\n  the difference, of the radii of the cylinders.\r\n\r\n  Let [alpha] denote the angular velocity with which the _plane of axes_\r\n  AB rotates about the fixed axis A. Then it is evident that\r\n\r\n    v_B = [alpha]·AB,  (5)\r\n\r\n  and consequently that\r\n\r\n    [alpha] = [gamma]·TB/AB.  (6)\r\n\r\n  For internal rolling, as in fig. 92, AB is to be treated as negative,\r\n  which will give a negative value to [alpha], indicating that in this\r\n  case the rotation of AB round A is contrary to that of the cylinder\r\n  bbb.\r\n\r\n  The angular velocity of the rolling cylinder, _relatively to the plane\r\n  of axes_ AB, is obviously given by the equation--\r\n\r\n    [beta] = [gamma] - [alpha]     \\\r\n                                    >,  (7)\r\n    whence [beta] = [gamma]·TA/AB  /\r\n\r\n  care being taken to attend to the sign of [alpha], so that when that\r\n  is negative the arithmetical values of [gamma] and [alpha] are to be\r\n  added in order to give that of [beta].\r\n\r\n  The whole of the foregoing reasonings are applicable, not merely when\r\n  aaa and bbb are actual cylinders, but also when they are the\r\n  osculating cylinders of a pair of cylindroidal surfaces of varying\r\n  curvature, A and B being the axes of curvature of the parts of those\r\n  surfaces which are in contact for the instant under consideration.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 93.]\r\n\r\n  § 31. _Instantaneous Axis of a Cone rolling on a Cone._--Let Oaa (fig.\r\n  93) be a fixed cone, OA its axis, Obb a cone rolling on it, OB the\r\n  axis of the rolling cone, OT the line of contact of the two cones at\r\n  the instant under consideration. By reasoning similar to that of § 30,\r\n  it appears that OT is the instantaneous axis of rotation of the\r\n  rolling cone.\r\n\r\n  Let [gamma] denote the total angular velocity of the rotation of the\r\n  cone B about the instantaneous axis, [beta] its angular velocity about\r\n  the axis OB _relatively_ to the plane AOB, and [alpha] the angular\r\n  velocity with which the plane AOB turns round the axis OA. It is\r\n  required to find the ratios of those angular velocities.\r\n\r\n  _Solution._--In OT take any point E, from which draw EC parallel to\r\n  OA, and ED parallel to OB, so as to construct the parallelogram OCED.\r\n  Then\r\n\r\n    OD : OC : OE :: [alpha] : [beta] : [gamma].  (8)\r\n\r\n  Or because of the proportionality of the sides of triangles to the\r\n  sines of the opposite angles,\r\n\r\n    sin TOB : sin TOA : sin AOB :: [alpha] : [beta] : [gamma],  (8 A)\r\n\r\n  that is to say, the angular velocity about each axis is proportional\r\n  to the sine of the angle between the other two.\r\n\r\n  _Demonstration._--From C draw CF perpendicular to OA, and CG\r\n  perpendicular to OE\r\n\r\n                  area ECO\r\n    Then CF = 2 × --------,\r\n                     CE\r\n\r\n                  area ECO\r\n    and CG = 2 ×  --------;\r\n                     OE\r\n\r\n    :. CG : CF :: CE = OD : OE.\r\n\r\n  Let v_c denote the linear velocity of the point C. Then\r\n\r\n    v_c = [alpha] · CF = [gamma]·CG\r\n    :. [gamma] : [alpha] :: CF : CG :: OE : OD,\r\n\r\n  which is one part of the solution above stated. From E draw EH\r\n  perpendicular to OB, and EK to OA. Then it can be shown as before that\r\n\r\n    EK : EH :: OC : OD.\r\n\r\n  Let v_E be the linear velocity of the point E _fixed in the plane of\r\n  axes_ AOB. Then\r\n\r\n    v_K = [alpha] · EK.\r\n\r\n  Now, as the line of contact OT is for the instant at rest on the\r\n  rolling cone as well as on the fixed cone, the linear velocity of the\r\n  point E fixed to the plane AOB relatively to the rolling cone is the\r\n  same with its velocity relatively to the fixed cone. That is to say,\r\n\r\n    [beta]·EH = v_E = [alpha]·EK;\r\n\r\n  therefore\r\n\r\n    [alpha] : [beta] :: EH : EK :: OD : OC,\r\n\r\n  which is the remainder of the solution.\r\n\r\n  The path of a point P in or attached to the rolling cone is a\r\n  spherical epitrochoid traced on the surface of a sphere of the radius\r\n  OP. From P draw PQ perpendicular to the instantaneous axis. Then the\r\n  motion of P is perpendicular to the plane OPQ, and its velocity is\r\n\r\n    v_P = [gamma]·PQ.  (9)\r\n\r\n  The whole of the foregoing reasonings are applicable, not merely when\r\n  A and B are actual regular cones, but also when they are the\r\n  osculating regular cones of a pair of irregular conical surfaces,\r\n  having a common apex at O.\r\n\r\n  § 32. _Screw-like or Helical Motion._--Since any displacement in a\r\n  plane can be represented in general by a rotation, it follows that the\r\n  only combination of translation and rotation, in which a complex\r\n  movement which is not a mere rotation is produced, occurs when there\r\n  is a translation _perpendicular to the plane and parallel to the axis_\r\n  of rotation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 94.]\r\n\r\n  Such a complex motion is called _screw-like_ or _helical_ motion; for\r\n  each point in the body describes a _helix_ or _screw_ round the axis\r\n  of rotation, fixed or instantaneous as the case may be. To cause a\r\n  body to move in this manner it is usually made of a helical or\r\n  screw-like figure, and moves in a guide of a corresponding figure.\r\n  Helical motion and screws adapted to it are said to be right- or\r\n  left-handed according to the appearance presented by the rotation to\r\n  an observer looking towards the direction of the translation. Thus the\r\n  screw G in fig. 94 is right-handed.\r\n\r\n  The translation of a body in helical motion is called its _advance_.\r\n  Let v_x denote the velocity of advance at a given instant, which of\r\n  course is common to all the particles of the body; [alpha] the angular\r\n  velocity of the rotation at the same instant; 2[pi] = 6.2832 nearly,\r\n  the circumference of a circle of the radius unity. Then\r\n\r\n    T = 2[pi]/[alpha]  (10)\r\n\r\n  is the time of one turn at the rate [alpha]; and\r\n\r\n    p = v_x T = 2[pi]v_x/[alpha]  (11)\r\n\r\n  is the _pitch_ or _advance per turn_--a length which expresses the\r\n  _comparative motion_ of the translation and the rotation.\r\n\r\n  The pitch of a screw is the distance, measured parallel to its axis,\r\n  between two successive turns of the same _thread_ or helical\r\n  projection.\r\n\r\n  Let r denote the perpendicular distance of a point in a body moving\r\n  helically from the axis. Then\r\n\r\n    v_r = [alpha]r  (12)\r\n\r\n  is the component of the velocity of that point in a plane\r\n  perpendicular to the axis, and its total velocity is\r\n\r\n    v = [root](v_x² + v_r²).  (13)\r\n\r\n  The ratio of the two components of that velocity is\r\n\r\n    v_x/v_r = p/2[pi]r = tan [theta].  (14)\r\n\r\n  where [theta] denotes the angle made by the helical path of the point\r\n  with a plane perpendicular to the axis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Division 4. Elementary Combinations in Mechanism_\r\n\r\n  § 33. _Definitions._--An _elementary combination_ in mechanism\r\n  consists of two pieces whose kinds of motion are determined by their\r\n  connexion with the frame, and their comparative motion by their\r\n  connexion with each other--that connexion being effected either by\r\n  direct contact of the pieces, or by a connecting piece, which is not\r\n  connected with the frame, and whose motion depends entirely on the\r\n  motions of the pieces which it connects.\r\n\r\n  The piece whose motion is the cause is called the _driver_; the piece\r\n  whose motion is the effect, the _follower_.\r\n\r\n  The connexion of each of those two pieces with the frame is in general\r\n  such as to determine the path of every point in it. In the\r\n  investigation, therefore, of the comparative motion of the driver and\r\n  follower, in an elementary combination, it is unnecessary to consider\r\n  relations of angular direction, which are already fixed by the\r\n  connexion of each piece with the frame; so that the inquiry is\r\n  confined to the determination of the velocity ratio, and of the\r\n  directional relation, so far only as it expresses the connexion\r\n  between _forward_ and _backward_ movements of the driver and follower.\r\n  When a continuous motion of the driver produces a continuous motion of\r\n  the follower, forward or backward, and a reciprocating motion a motion\r\n  reciprocating at the same instant, the directional relation is said to\r\n  be _constant_. When a continuous motion produces a reciprocating\r\n  motion, or vice versa, or when a reciprocating motion produces a\r\n  motion not reciprocating at the same instant, the directional relation\r\n  is said to be _variable_.\r\n\r\n  The _line of action_ or _of connexion_ of the driver and follower is a\r\n  line traversing a pair of points in the driver and follower\r\n  respectively, which are so connected that the component of their\r\n  velocity relatively to each other, resolved along the line of\r\n  connexion, is null. There may be several or an indefinite number of\r\n  lines of connexion, or there may be but one; and a line of connexion\r\n  may connect either the same pair of points or a succession of\r\n  different pairs.\r\n\r\n  § 34. _General Principle._--From the definition of a line of connexion\r\n  it follows that _the components of the velocities of a pair of\r\n  connected points along their line of connexion are equal_. And from\r\n  this, and from the property of a rigid body, already stated in § 29,\r\n  it follows, that _the components along a line of connexion of all the\r\n  points traversed by that line, whether in the driver or in the\r\n  follower, are equal_; and consequently, _that the velocities of any\r\n  pair of points traversed by a line of connexion are to each other\r\n  inversely as the cosines, or directly as the secants, of the angles\r\n  made by the paths of those points with the line of connexion_.\r\n\r\n  The general principle stated above in different forms serves to solve\r\n  every problem in which--the mode of connexion of a pair of pieces\r\n  being given--it is required to find their comparative motion at a\r\n  given instant, or vice versa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 95.]\r\n\r\n  § 35. _Application to a Pair of Shifting Pieces._--In fig. 95, let\r\n  P1P2 be the line of connexion of a pair of pieces, each of which has a\r\n  motion of translation or shifting. Through any point T in that line\r\n  draw TV1, TV2, respectively parallel to the simultaneous direction of\r\n  motion of the pieces; through any other point A in the line of\r\n  connexion draw a plane perpendicular to that line, cutting TV1, TV2 in\r\n  V1, V2; then, velocity of piece 1 : velocity of piece 2 :: TV1 : TV2.\r\n  Also TA represents the equal components of the velocities of the\r\n  pieces parallel to their line of connexion, and the line V1V2\r\n  represents their velocity relatively to each other.\r\n\r\n  § 36. _Application to a Pair of Turning Pieces._--Let [alpha]1,\r\n  [alpha]2 be the angular velocities of a pair of turning pieces;\r\n  [theta]1, [theta]2 the angles which their line of connexion makes with\r\n  their respective planes of rotation; r1, r2 the common perpendiculars\r\n  let fall from the line of connexion upon the respective axes of\r\n  rotation of the pieces. Then the equal components, along the line of\r\n  connexion, of the velocities of the points where those perpendiculars\r\n  meet that line are--\r\n\r\n    [alpha]1r1 cos [theta]1 = [alpha]2r2 cos [theta]2;\r\n\r\n  consequently, the comparative motion of the pieces is given by the\r\n  equation\r\n\r\n    [alpha]2   r1 cos [theta]1\r\n    -------- = ---------------.  (15)\r\n    [alpha]1   r2 cos [theta]2\r\n\r\n  § 37. _Application to a Shifting Piece and a Turning Piece._--Let a\r\n  shifting piece be connected with a turning piece, and at a given\r\n  instant let [alpha]1 be the angular velocity of the turning piece, r1\r\n  the common perpendicular of its axis of rotation and the line of\r\n  connexion, [theta]1 the angle made by the line of connexion with the\r\n  plane of rotation, [theta]2 the angle made by the line of connexion\r\n  with the direction of motion of the shifting piece, v2 the linear\r\n  velocity of that piece. Then\r\n\r\n    [alpha]1r1 cos [theta]1 = v2 cos [theta]2;  (16)\r\n\r\n  which equation expresses the comparative motion of the two pieces.\r\n\r\n  § 38. _Classification of Elementary Combinations in Mechanism._--The\r\n  first systematic classification of elementary combinations in\r\n  mechanism was that founded by Monge, and fully developed by Lanz and\r\n  Bétancourt, which has been generally received, and has been adopted in\r\n  most treatises on applied mechanics. But that classification is\r\n  founded on the absolute instead of the comparative motions of the\r\n  pieces, and is, for that reason, defective, as Willis pointed out in\r\n  his admirable treatise _On the Principles of Mechanism_.\r\n\r\n  Willis's classification is founded, in the first place, on comparative\r\n  motion, as expressed by velocity ratio and directional relation, and\r\n  in the second place, on the mode of connexion of the driver and\r\n  follower. He divides the elementary combinations in mechanism into\r\n  three classes, of which the characters are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Class A: Directional relation constant; velocity ratio constant.\r\n\r\n  Class B: Directional relation constant; velocity ratio varying.\r\n\r\n  Class C: Directional relation changing periodically; velocity ratio\r\n  constant or varying.\r\n\r\n  Each of those classes is subdivided by Willis into five divisions, of\r\n  which the characters are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Division A: Connexion by rolling contact.\r\n        \"    B:     \"      \"  sliding contact.\r\n        \"    C:     \"      \"  wrapping connectors.\r\n        \"    D:     \"      \"  link-work.\r\n        \"    E:     \"      \"  reduplication.\r\n\r\n  In the Reuleaux system of analysis of mechanisms the principle of\r\n  comparative motion is generalized, and mechanisms apparently very\r\n  diverse in character are shown to be founded on the same sequence of\r\n  elementary combinations forming a kinematic chain. A short description\r\n  of this system is given in § 80, but in the present article the\r\n  principle of Willis's classification is followed mainly. The\r\n  arrangement is, however, modified by taking the _mode of connexion_ as\r\n  the basis of the primary classification, and by removing the subject\r\n  of connexion by reduplication to the section of aggregate\r\n  combinations. This modified arrangement is adopted as being better\r\n  suited than the original arrangement to the limits of an article in an\r\n  encyclopaedia; but it is not disputed that the original arrangement\r\n  may be the best for a separate treatise.\r\n\r\n  § 39. _Rolling Contact: Smooth Wheels and Racks._--In order that two\r\n  pieces may move in rolling contact, it is necessary that each pair of\r\n  points in the two pieces which touch each other should at the instant\r\n  of contact be moving in the same direction with the same velocity. In\r\n  the case of two _shifting_ pieces this would involve equal and\r\n  parallel velocities for all the points of each piece, so that there\r\n  could be no rolling, and, in fact, the two pieces would move like one;\r\n  hence, in the case of rolling contact, either one or both of the\r\n  pieces must rotate.\r\n\r\n  The direction of motion of a point in a turning piece being\r\n  perpendicular to a plane passing through its axis, the condition that\r\n  each pair of points in contact with each other must move in the same\r\n  direction leads to the following consequences:--\r\n\r\n  I. That, when both pieces rotate, their axes, and all their points of\r\n  contact, lie in the same plane.\r\n\r\n  II. That, when one piece rotates, and the other shifts, the axis of\r\n  the rotating piece, and all the points of contact, lie in a plane\r\n  perpendicular to the direction of motion of the shifting piece.\r\n\r\n  The condition that the velocity of each pair of points of contact must\r\n  be equal leads to the following consequences:--\r\n\r\n  III. That the angular velocities of a pair of turning pieces in\r\n  rolling contact must be inversely as the perpendicular distances of\r\n  any pair of points of contact from the respective axes.\r\n\r\n  IV. That the linear velocity of a shifting piece in rolling contact\r\n  with a turning piece is equal to the product of the angular velocity\r\n  of the turning piece by the perpendicular distance from its axis to a\r\n  pair of points of contact.\r\n\r\n  The _line of contact_ is that line in which the points of contact are\r\n  all situated. Respecting this line, the above Principles III. and IV.\r\n  lead to the following conclusions:--\r\n\r\n  V. That for a pair of turning pieces with parallel axes, and for a\r\n  turning piece and a shifting piece, the line of contact is straight,\r\n  and parallel to the axes or axis; and hence that the rolling surfaces\r\n  are either plane or cylindrical (the term \"cylindrical\" including all\r\n  surfaces generated by the motion of a straight line parallel to\r\n  itself).\r\n\r\n  VI. That for a pair of turning pieces with intersecting axes the line\r\n  of contact is also straight, and traverses the point of intersection\r\n  of the axes; and hence that the rolling surfaces are conical, with a\r\n  common apex (the term \"conical\" including all surfaces generated by\r\n  the motion of a straight line which traverses a fixed point).\r\n\r\n  Turning pieces in rolling contact are called _smooth_ or _toothless\r\n  wheels_. Shifting pieces in rolling contact with turning pieces may be\r\n  called _smooth_ or _toothless racks_.\r\n\r\n  VII. In a pair of pieces in rolling contact every straight line\r\n  traversing the line of contact is a line of connexion.\r\n\r\n  § 40. _Cylindrical Wheels and Smooth Racks._--In designing cylindrical\r\n  wheels and smooth racks, and determining their comparative motion, it\r\n  is sufficient to consider a section of the pair of pieces made by a\r\n  plane perpendicular to the axis or axes.\r\n\r\n  The points where axes intersect the plane of section are called\r\n  _centres_; the point where the line of contact intersects it, the\r\n  _point of contact_, or _pitch-point_; and the wheels are described as\r\n  _circular_, _elliptical_, &c., according to the forms of their\r\n  sections made by that plane.\r\n\r\n  When the point of contact of two wheels lies between their centres,\r\n  they are said to be in _outside gearing_; when beyond their centres,\r\n  in _inside gearing_, because the rolling surface of the larger wheel\r\n  must in this case be turned inward or towards its centre.\r\n\r\n  From Principle III. of § 39 it appears that the angular velocity-ratio\r\n  of a pair of wheels is the inverse ratio of the distances of the point\r\n  of contact from the centres respectively.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 96.]\r\n\r\n  For outside gearing that ratio is _negative_, because the wheels turn\r\n  contrary ways; for inside gearing it is _positive_, because they turn\r\n  the same way.\r\n\r\n  If the velocity ratio is to be constant, as in Willis's Class A, the\r\n  wheels must be circular; and this is the most common form for wheels.\r\n\r\n  If the velocity ratio is to be variable, as in Willis's Class B, the\r\n  figures of the wheels are a pair of _rolling curves_, subject to the\r\n  condition that the distance between their _poles_ (which are the\r\n  centres of rotation) shall be constant.\r\n\r\n  The following is the geometrical relation which must exist between\r\n  such a pair of curves:--\r\n\r\n  Let C1, C2 (fig. 96) be the poles of a pair of rolling curves; T1, T2\r\n  any pair of points of contact; U1, U2 any other pair of points of\r\n  contact. Then, for every possible pair of points of contact, the two\r\n  following equations must be simultaneously fulfilled:--\r\n\r\n    Sum of radii, C1U1 + C2U2 = C1T1 + C2T2 = constant;\r\n    arc, T2U2 = T1U1.  (17)\r\n\r\n  A condition equivalent to the above, and necessarily connected with\r\n  it, is, that at each pair of points of contact the inclinations of the\r\n  curves to their radii-vectores shall be equal and contrary; or,\r\n  denoting by r1, r2 the radii-vectores at any given pair of points of\r\n  contact, and s the length of the equal arcs measured from a certain\r\n  fixed pair of points of contact--\r\n\r\n    dr2/ds = -dr1/ds;  (18)\r\n\r\n  which is the differential equation of a pair of rolling curves whose\r\n  poles are at a constant distance apart.\r\n\r\n  For full details as to rolling curves, see Willis's work, already\r\n  mentioned, and Clerk Maxwell's paper on Rolling Curves, _Trans. Roy.\r\n  Soc. Edin._, 1849.\r\n\r\n  A rack, to work with a circular wheel, must be straight. To work with\r\n  a wheel of any other figure, its section must be a rolling curve,\r\n  subject to the condition that the perpendicular distance from the pole\r\n  or centre of the wheel to a straight line parallel to the direction of\r\n  the motion of the rack shall be constant. Let r1 be the radius-vector\r\n  of a point of contact on the wheel, x2 the ordinate from the straight\r\n  line before mentioned to the corresponding point of contact on the\r\n  rack. Then\r\n\r\n    dx2/ds = -dr1/ds  (19)\r\n\r\n  is the differential equation of the pair of rolling curves.\r\n\r\n  To illustrate this subject, it may be mentioned that an ellipse\r\n  rotating about one focus rolls completely round in outside gearing\r\n  with an equal and similar ellipse also rotating about one focus, the\r\n  distance between the axes of rotation being equal to the major axis of\r\n  the ellipses, and the velocity ratio varying from (1 +\r\n  eccentricity)/(1 - eccentricity) to (1 - eccentricity)/(1 +\r\n  eccentricity); an hyperbola rotating about its further focus rolls in\r\n  inside gearing, through a limited arc, with an equal and similar\r\n  hyperbola rotating about its nearer focus, the distance between the\r\n  axes of rotation being equal to the axis of the hyperbolas, and the\r\n  velocity ratio varying between (eccentricity + 1)/(eccentricity - 1)\r\n  and unity; and a parabola rotating about its focus rolls with an equal\r\n  and similar parabola, shifting parallel to its directrix.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 97.]\r\n\r\n  § 41. _Conical or Bevel and Disk Wheels._--From Principles III. and\r\n  VI. of § 39 it appears that the angular velocities of a pair of wheels\r\n  whose axes meet in a point are to each other inversely as the sines of\r\n  the angles which the axes of the wheels make with the line of contact.\r\n  Hence we have the following construction (figs. 97 and 98).--Let O be\r\n  the apex or point of intersection of the two axes OC1, OC2. The\r\n  angular velocity ratio being given, it is required to find the line of\r\n  contact. On OC1, OC2 take lengths OA1, OA2, respectively proportional\r\n  to the angular velocities of the pieces on whose axes they are taken.\r\n  Complete the parallelogram OA1EA2; the diagonal OET will be the line\r\n  of contact required.\r\n\r\n  When the velocity ratio is variable, the line of contact will shift\r\n  its position in the plane C1OC2, and the wheels will be cones, with\r\n  eccentric or irregular bases. In every case which occurs in practice,\r\n  however, the velocity ratio is constant; the line of contact is\r\n  constant in position, and the rolling surfaces of the wheels are\r\n  regular circular cones (when they are called _bevel wheels_); or one\r\n  of a pair of wheels may have a flat disk for its rolling surface, as\r\n  W2 in fig. 98, in which case it is a _disk wheel_. The rolling\r\n  surfaces of actual wheels consist of frusta or zones of the complete\r\n  cones or disks, as shown by W1, W2 in figs. 97 and 98.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 98.]\r\n\r\n  § 42. _Sliding Contact (lateral): Skew-Bevel Wheels._--An hyperboloid\r\n  of revolution is a surface resembling a sheaf or a dice box, generated\r\n  by the rotation of a straight line round an axis from which it is at a\r\n  constant distance, and to which it is inclined at a constant angle. If\r\n  two such hyperboloids E, F, equal or unequal, be placed in the closest\r\n  possible contact, as in fig. 99, they will touch each other along one\r\n  of the generating straight lines of each, which will form their line\r\n  of contact, and will be inclined to the axes AG, BH in opposite\r\n  directions. The axes will not be parallel, nor will they intersect\r\n  each other.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 99.]\r\n\r\n  The motion of two such hyperboloids, turning in contact with each\r\n  other, has hitherto been classed amongst cases of rolling contact; but\r\n  that classification is not strictly correct, for, although the\r\n  component velocities of a pair of points of contact in a direction at\r\n  right angles to the line of contact are equal, still, as the axes are\r\n  parallel neither to each other nor to the line of contact, the\r\n  velocities of a pair of points of contact have components along the\r\n  line of contact which are unequal, and their difference constitutes a\r\n  _lateral sliding_.\r\n\r\n  The directions and positions of the axes being given, and the required\r\n  angular velocity ratio, the following construction serves to determine\r\n  the line of contact, by whose rotation round the two axes respectively\r\n  the hyperboloids are generated:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 100.]\r\n\r\n  In fig. 100, let B1C1, B2C2 be the two axes; B1B2 their common\r\n  perpendicular. Through any point O in this common perpendicular draw\r\n  OA1 parallel to B1C1 and OA2 parallel to B2C2; make those lines\r\n  proportional to the angular velocities about the axes to which they\r\n  are respectively parallel; complete the parallelogram OA1EA2, and draw\r\n  the diagonal OE; divide B1B2 in D into two parts, _inversely_\r\n  proportional to the angular velocities about the axes which they\r\n  respectively adjoin; through D parallel to OE draw DT. This will be\r\n  the line of contact.\r\n\r\n  A pair of thin frusta of a pair of hyperboloids are used in practice\r\n  to communicate motion between a pair of axes neither parallel nor\r\n  intersecting, and are called _skew-bevel wheels_.\r\n\r\n  In skew-bevel wheels the properties of a line of connexion are not\r\n  possessed by every line traversing the line of contact, but only by\r\n  every line traversing the line of contact at right angles.\r\n\r\n  If the velocity ratio to be communicated were variable, the point D\r\n  would alter its position, and the line DT its direction, at different\r\n  periods of the motion, and the wheels would be hyperboloids of an\r\n  eccentric or irregular cross-section; but forms of this kind are not\r\n  used in practice.\r\n\r\n  § 43. _Sliding Contact (circular): Grooved Wheels._--As the adhesion\r\n  or friction between a pair of smooth wheels is seldom sufficient to\r\n  prevent their slipping on each other, contrivances are used to\r\n  increase their mutual hold. One of those consists in forming the rim\r\n  of each wheel into a series of alternate ridges and grooves parallel\r\n  to the plane of rotation; it is applicable to cylindrical and bevel\r\n  wheels, but not to skew-bevel wheels. The comparative motion of a pair\r\n  of wheels so ridged and grooved is the same as that of a pair of\r\n  smooth wheels in rolling contact, whose cylindrical or conical\r\n  surfaces lie midway between the tops of the ridges and bottoms of the\r\n  grooves, and those ideal smooth surfaces are called the _pitch\r\n  surfaces_ of the wheels.\r\n\r\n  The relative motion of the faces of contact of the ridges and grooves\r\n  is a _rotatory sliding_ or _grinding_ motion, about the line of\r\n  contact of the pitch-surfaces as an instantaneous axis.\r\n\r\n  Grooved wheels have hitherto been but little used.\r\n\r\n  § 44. _Sliding Contact (direct): Teeth of Wheels, their Number and\r\n  Pitch._--The ordinary method of connecting a pair of wheels, or a\r\n  wheel and a rack, and the only method which ensures the exact\r\n  maintenance of a given numerical velocity ratio, is by means of a\r\n  series of alternate ridges and hollows parallel or nearly parallel to\r\n  the successive lines of contact of the ideal smooth wheels whose\r\n  velocity ratio would be the same with that of the toothed wheels. The\r\n  ridges are called _teeth_; the hollows, _spaces_. The teeth of the\r\n  driver push those of the follower before them, and in so doing\r\n  sliding takes place between them in a direction across their lines of\r\n  contact.\r\n\r\n  The _pitch-surfaces_ of a pair of toothed wheels are the ideal smooth\r\n  surfaces which would have the same comparative motion by rolling\r\n  contact that the actual wheels have by the sliding contact of their\r\n  teeth. The _pitch-circles_ of a pair of circular toothed wheels are\r\n  sections of their pitch-surfaces, made for _spur-wheels_ (that is, for\r\n  wheels whose axes are parallel) by a plane at right angles to the\r\n  axes, and for bevel wheels by a sphere described about the common\r\n  apex. For a pair of skew-bevel wheels the pitch-circles are a pair of\r\n  contiguous rectangular sections of the pitch-surfaces. The\r\n  _pitch-point_ is the point of contact of the pitch-circles.\r\n\r\n  The pitch-surface of a wheel lies intermediate between the points of\r\n  the teeth and the bottoms of the hollows between them. That part of\r\n  the acting surface of a tooth which projects beyond the pitch-surface\r\n  is called the _face_; that part which lies within the pitch-surface,\r\n  the _flank_.\r\n\r\n  Teeth, when not otherwise specified, are understood to be made in one\r\n  piece with the wheel, the material being generally cast-iron, brass or\r\n  bronze. Separate teeth, fixed into mortises in the rim of the wheel,\r\n  are called _cogs_. A _pinion_ is a small toothed wheel; a _trundle_ is\r\n  a pinion with cylindrical _staves_ for teeth.\r\n\r\n  The radius of the pitch-circle of a wheel is called the _geometrical\r\n  radius_; a circle touching the ends of the teeth is called the\r\n  _addendum circle_, and its radius the _real radius_; the difference\r\n  between these radii, being the projection of the teeth beyond the\r\n  pitch-surface, is called the _addendum_.\r\n\r\n  The distance, measured along the pitch-circle, from the face of one\r\n  tooth to the face of the next, is called the _pitch_. The pitch and\r\n  the number of teeth in wheels are regulated by the following\r\n  principles:--\r\n\r\n  I. In wheels which rotate continuously for one revolution or more, it\r\n  is obviously necessary _that the pitch should be an aliquot part of\r\n  the circumference_.\r\n\r\n  In wheels which reciprocate without performing a complete revolution\r\n  this condition is not necessary. Such wheels are called _sectors_.\r\n\r\n  II. In order that a pair of wheels, or a wheel and a rack, may work\r\n  correctly together, it is in all cases essential _that the pitch\r\n  should be the same in each_.\r\n\r\n  III. Hence, in any pair of circular wheels which work together, the\r\n  numbers of teeth in a complete circumference are directly as the radii\r\n  and inversely as the angular velocities.\r\n\r\n  IV. Hence also, in any pair of circular wheels which rotate\r\n  continuously for one revolution or more, the ratio of the numbers of\r\n  teeth and its reciprocal the angular velocity ratio must be\r\n  expressible in whole numbers.\r\n\r\n  From this principle arise problems of a kind which will be referred to\r\n  in treating of _Trains of Mechanism_.\r\n\r\n  V. Let n, N be the respective numbers of teeth in a pair of wheels, N\r\n  being the greater. Let t, T be a pair of teeth in the smaller and\r\n  larger wheel respectively, which at a particular instant work\r\n  together. It is required to find, first, how many pairs of teeth must\r\n  pass the line of contact of the pitch-surfaces before t and T work\r\n  together again (let this number be called a); and, secondly, with how\r\n  many different teeth of the larger wheel the tooth t will work at\r\n  different times (let this number be called b); thirdly, with how many\r\n  different teeth of the smaller wheel the tooth T will work at\r\n  different times (let this be called c).\r\n\r\n  CASE 1. If n is a divisor of N,\r\n\r\n    a = N; b = N/n; c = 1.  (20)\r\n\r\n  CASE 2. If the greatest common divisor of N and n be d, a number less\r\n  than n, so that n = md, N = Md; then\r\n\r\n    a = mN = Mn = Mmd; b = M; c = m.  (21)\r\n\r\n  CASE 3. If N and n be prime to each other,\r\n\r\n    a = nN; b = N; c = n.  (22)\r\n\r\n  It is considered desirable by millwrights, with a view to the\r\n  preservation of the uniformity of shape of the teeth of a pair of\r\n  wheels, that each given tooth in one wheel should work with as many\r\n  different teeth in the other wheel as possible. They therefore study\r\n  that the numbers of teeth in each pair of wheels which work together\r\n  shall either be prime to each other, or shall have their greatest\r\n  common divisor as small as is consistent with a velocity ratio suited\r\n  for the purposes of the machine.\r\n\r\n  § 45. _Sliding Contact: Forms of the Teeth of Spur-wheels and\r\n  Racks._--A line of connexion of two pieces in sliding contact is a\r\n  line perpendicular to their surfaces at a point where they touch.\r\n  Bearing this in mind, the principle of the comparative motion of a\r\n  pair of teeth belonging to a pair of spur-wheels, or to a spur-wheel\r\n  and a rack, is found by applying the principles stated generally in §§\r\n  36 and 37 to the case of parallel axes for a pair of spur-wheels, and\r\n  to the case of an axis perpendicular to the direction of shifting for\r\n  a wheel and a rack.\r\n\r\n  In fig. 101, let C1, C2 be the centres of a pair of spur-wheels;\r\n  B1IB1´, B2IB2´ portions of their pitch-circles, touching at I, the\r\n  pitch-point. Let the wheel 1 be the driver, and the wheel 2 the\r\n  follower.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 101.]\r\n\r\n  Let D1TB1A1, D2TB2A2 be the positions, at a given instant, of the\r\n  acting surfaces of a pair of teeth in the driver and follower\r\n  respectively, touching each other at T; the line of connexion of those\r\n  teeth is P1P2, perpendicular to their surfaces at T. Let C1P1, C2P2 be\r\n  perpendiculars let fall from the centres of the wheels on the line of\r\n  contact. Then, by § 36, the angular velocity-ratio is\r\n\r\n    [alpha]2/[alpha]1 = C1P1/C2P2.  (23)\r\n\r\n  The following principles regulate the forms of the teeth and their\r\n  relative motions:--\r\n\r\n  I. The angular velocity ratio due to the sliding contact of the teeth\r\n  will be the same with that due to the rolling contact of the\r\n  pitch-circles, if the line of connexion of the teeth cuts the line of\r\n  centres at the pitch-point.\r\n\r\n  For, let P1P2 cut the line of centres at I; then, by similar\r\n  triangles,\r\n\r\n    [alpha]1 : [alpha]2 :: C2P2 : C1P1 :: IC2 :: IC1;  (24)\r\n\r\n  which is also the angular velocity ratio due to the rolling contact of\r\n  the circles B1IB1´, B2IB2´.\r\n\r\n  This principle determines the _forms_ of all teeth of spur-wheels. It\r\n  also determines the forms of the teeth of straight racks, if one of\r\n  the centres be removed, and a straight line EIE´, parallel to the\r\n  direction of motion of the rack, and perpendicular to C1IC2, be\r\n  substituted for a pitch-circle.\r\n\r\n  II. The component of the velocity of the point of contact of the teeth\r\n  T along the line of connexion is\r\n\r\n    [alpha]1·C1P1 = [alpha]2·C2P2.  (25)\r\n\r\n  III. The relative velocity perpendicular to P1P2 of the teeth at their\r\n  point of contact--that is, their _velocity of sliding_ on each\r\n  other--is found by supposing one of the wheels, such as 1, to be\r\n  fixed, the line of centres C1C2 to rotate backwards round C1 with the\r\n  angular velocity [alpha]1, and the wheel 2 to rotate round C2 as\r\n  before, with the angular velocity [alpha]2 relatively to the line of\r\n  centres C1C2, so as to have the same motion as if its pitch-circle\r\n  _rolled_ on the pitch-circle of the first wheel. Thus the _relative_\r\n  motion of the wheels is unchanged; but 1 is considered as fixed, and 2\r\n  has the total motion, that is, a rotation about the instantaneous axis\r\n  I, with the angular velocity [alpha]1 + [alpha]2. Hence the _velocity\r\n  of sliding_ is that due to this rotation about I, with the radius IT;\r\n  that is to say, its value is\r\n\r\n    ([alpha]1 + [alpha]2)·IT;  (26)\r\n\r\n  so that it is greater the farther the point of contact is from the\r\n  line of centres; and at the instant when that point passes the line of\r\n  centres, and coincides with the _pitch-point_, the velocity of sliding\r\n  is null, and the action of the teeth is, for the instant, that of\r\n  rolling contact.\r\n\r\n  IV. The _path of contact_ is the line traversing the various positions\r\n  of the point T. If the line of connexion preserves always the same\r\n  position, the path of contact coincides with it, and is straight; in\r\n  other cases the path of contact is curved.\r\n\r\n  It is divided by the pitch-point I into two parts--the _arc_ or _line\r\n  of approach_ described by T in approaching the line of centres, and\r\n  the _arc_ or _line of recess_ described by T after having passed the\r\n  line of centres.\r\n\r\n  During the _approach_, the _flank_ D1B1 of the driving tooth drives\r\n  the face D2B2 of the following tooth, and the teeth are sliding\r\n  _towards_ each other. During the _recess_ (in which the position of\r\n  the teeth is exemplified in the figure by curves marked with accented\r\n  letters), the _face_ B1´A1´ of the driving tooth drives the _flank_\r\n  B2´A2´ of the following tooth, and the teeth are sliding _from_ each\r\n  other.\r\n\r\n  The path of contact is bounded where the approach commences by the\r\n  addendum-circle of the follower, and where the recess terminates by\r\n  the addendum-circle of the driver. The length of the path of contact\r\n  should be such that there shall always be at least one pair of teeth\r\n  in contact; and it is better still to make it so long that there shall\r\n  always be at least two pairs of teeth in contact.\r\n\r\n  V. The _obliquity_ of the action of the teeth is the angle EIT = IC1,\r\n  P1 = IC2P2.\r\n\r\n  In practice it is found desirable that the mean value of the obliquity\r\n  of action during the contact of teeth should not exceed 15°, nor the\r\n  maximum value 30°.\r\n\r\n  It is unnecessary to give separate figures and demonstrations for\r\n  inside gearing. The only modification required in the formulae is,\r\n  that in equation (26) the _difference_ of the angular velocities\r\n  should be substituted for their sum.\r\n\r\n  § 46. _Involute Teeth._--The simplest form of tooth which fulfils the\r\n  conditions of § 45 is obtained in the following manner (see fig. 102).\r\n  Let C1, C2 be the centres of two wheels, B1IB1´, B2IB2´ their\r\n  pitch-circles, I the pitch-point; let the obliquity of action of the\r\n  teeth be constant, so that the same straight line P1IP2 shall\r\n  represent at once the constant line of connexion of teeth and the path\r\n  of contact. Draw C1P1, C2P2 perpendicular to P1IP2, and with those\r\n  lines as radii describe about the centres of the wheels the circles\r\n  D1D1´, D2D2´, called _base-circles_. It is evident that the radii of\r\n  the base-circles bear to each other the same proportions as the radii\r\n  of the pitch-circles, and also that\r\n\r\n    C1P1 = IC1 · cos obliquity  \\  (27)\r\n    C2P2 = IC2 · cos obliquity  /\r\n\r\n  (The obliquity which is found to answer best in practice is about\r\n  14½°; its cosine is about 31/22, and its sine about ¼. These values\r\n  though not absolutely exact, are near enough to the truth for\r\n  practical purposes.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 102.]\r\n\r\n  Suppose the base-circles to be a pair of circular pulleys connected by\r\n  means of a cord whose course from pulley to pulley is P1IP2. As the\r\n  line of connexion of those pulleys is the same as that of the proposed\r\n  teeth, they will rotate with the required velocity ratio. Now, suppose\r\n  a tracing point T to be fixed to the cord, so as to be carried along\r\n  the path of contact P1IP2, that point will trace on a plane rotating\r\n  along with the wheel 1 part of the involute of the base-circle D1D1´,\r\n  and on a plane rotating along with the wheel 2 part of the involute of\r\n  the base-circle D2D2´; and the two curves so traced will always touch\r\n  each other in the required point of contact T, and will therefore\r\n  fulfil the condition required by Principle I. of § 45.\r\n\r\n  Consequently, one of the forms suitable for the teeth of wheels is the\r\n  involute of a circle; and the obliquity of the action of such teeth is\r\n  the angle whose cosine is the ratio of the radius of their base-circle\r\n  to that of the pitch-circle of the wheel.\r\n\r\n  All involute teeth of the same pitch work smoothly together.\r\n\r\n  To find the length of the path of contact on either side of the\r\n  pitch-point I, it is to be observed that the distance between the\r\n  fronts of two successive teeth, as measured along P1IP2, is less than\r\n  the pitch in the ratio of cos obliquity : I; and consequently that, if\r\n  distances equal to the pitch be marked off either way from I towards\r\n  P1 and P2 respectively, as the extremities of the path of contact, and\r\n  if, according to Principle IV. of § 45, the addendum-circles be\r\n  described through the points so found, there will always be at least\r\n  two pairs of teeth in action at once. In practice it is usual to make\r\n  the path of contact somewhat longer, viz. about 2.4 times the pitch;\r\n  and with this length of path, and the obliquity already mentioned of\r\n  14½°, the addendum is about 3.1 of the pitch.\r\n\r\n  The teeth of a _rack_, to work correctly with wheels having involute\r\n  teeth, should have plane surfaces perpendicular to the line of\r\n  connexion, and consequently making with the direction of motion of the\r\n  rack angles equal to the complement of the obliquity of action.\r\n\r\n  § 47. _Teeth for a given Path of Contact: Sang's Method._--In the\r\n  preceding section the form of the teeth is found by assuming a figure\r\n  for the path of contact, viz. the straight line. Any other convenient\r\n  figure may be assumed for the path of contact, and the corresponding\r\n  forms of the teeth found by determining what curves a point T, moving\r\n  along the assumed path of contact, will trace on two disks rotating\r\n  round the centres of the wheels with angular velocities bearing that\r\n  relation to the component velocity of T along TI, which is given by\r\n  Principle II. of § 45, and by equation (25). This method of finding\r\n  the forms of the teeth of wheels forms the subject of an elaborate and\r\n  most interesting treatise by Edward Sang.\r\n\r\n  All wheels having teeth of the same pitch, traced from the same path\r\n  of contact, work correctly together, and are said to belong to the\r\n  same set.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 103.]\r\n\r\n  § 48. _Teeth traced by Rolling Curves._--If any curve R (fig. 103) be\r\n  rolled on the inside of the pitch-circle BB of a wheel, it appears,\r\n  from § 30, that the instantaneous axis of the rolling curve at any\r\n  instant will be at the point I, where it touches the pitch-circle for\r\n  the moment, and that consequently the line AT, traced by a\r\n  tracing-point T, fixed to the rolling curve upon the plane of the\r\n  wheel, will be everywhere perpendicular to the straight line TI; so\r\n  that the traced curve AT will be suitable for the flank of a tooth, in\r\n  which T is the point of contact corresponding to the position I of the\r\n  pitch-point. If the same rolling curve R, with the same tracing-point\r\n  T, be rolled on the _outside_ of any other pitch-circle, it will have\r\n  the _face_ of a tooth suitable to work with the _flank_ AT.\r\n\r\n  In like manner, if either the same or any other rolling curve R´ be\r\n  rolled the opposite way, on the _outside_ of the pitch-circle BB, so\r\n  that the tracing point T´ shall start from A, it will trace the face\r\n  AT´ of a tooth suitable to work with a _flank_ traced by rolling the\r\n  same curve R´ with the same tracing-point T´ _inside_ any other\r\n  pitch-circle.\r\n\r\n  The figure of the _path of contact_ is that traced on a fixed plane by\r\n  the tracing-point, when the rolling curve is rotated in such a manner\r\n  as always to touch a fixed straight line EIE (or E´I´E´, as the case\r\n  may be) at a fixed point I (or I´).\r\n\r\n  If the same rolling curve and tracing-point be used to trace both the\r\n  faces and the flanks of the teeth of a number of wheels of different\r\n  sizes but of the same pitch, all those wheels will work correctly\r\n  together, and will form a _set_. The teeth of a _rack_, of the same\r\n  set, are traced by rolling the rolling curve on both sides of a\r\n  straight line.\r\n\r\n  The teeth of wheels of any figure, as well as of circular wheels, may\r\n  be traced by rolling curves on their pitch-surfaces; and all teeth of\r\n  the same pitch, traced by the same rolling curve with the same\r\n  tracing-point, will work together correctly if their pitch-surfaces\r\n  are in rolling contact.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 104.]\r\n\r\n  § 49. _Epicycloidal Teeth._--The most convenient rolling curve is the\r\n  circle. The path of contact which it traces is identical with itself;\r\n  and the flanks of the teeth are internal and their faces external\r\n  epicycloids for wheels, and both flanks and faces are cycloids for a\r\n  rack.\r\n\r\n  For a pitch-circle of twice the radius of the rolling or _describing_\r\n  circle (as it is called) the internal epicycloid is a straight line,\r\n  being, in fact, a diameter of the pitch-circle, so that the flanks of\r\n  the teeth for such a pitch-circle are planes radiating from the axis.\r\n  For a smaller pitch-circle the flanks would be convex and _in-curved_\r\n  or _under-cut_, which would be inconvenient; therefore the smallest\r\n  wheel of a set should have its pitch-circle of twice the radius of the\r\n  describing circle, so that the flanks may be either straight or\r\n  concave.\r\n\r\n  In fig. 104 let BB´ be part of the pitch-circle of a wheel with\r\n  epicycloidal teeth; CIC´ the line of centres; I the pitch-point; EIE´\r\n  a straight tangent to the pitch-circle at that point; R the internal\r\n  and R´ the equal external describing circles, so placed as to touch\r\n  the pitch-circle and each other at I. Let DID´ be the path of contact,\r\n  consisting of the arc of approach DI and the arc of recess ID´. In\r\n  order that there may always be at least two pairs of teeth in action,\r\n  each of those arcs should be equal to the pitch.\r\n\r\n  The obliquity of the action in passing the line of centres is nothing;\r\n  the maximum obliquity is the angle EID = E´ID; and the mean obliquity\r\n  is one-half of that angle.\r\n\r\n  It appears from experience that the mean obliquity should not exceed\r\n  15°; therefore the maximum obliquity should be about 30°; therefore\r\n  the equal arcs DI and ID´ should each be one-sixth of a circumference;\r\n  therefore the circumference of the describing circle should be _six\r\n  times the pitch_.\r\n\r\n  It follows that the smallest pinion of a set in which pinion the\r\n  flanks are straight should have twelve teeth.\r\n\r\n  § 50. _Nearly Epicycloidal Teeth: Willis's Method._--To facilitate the\r\n  drawing of epicycloidal teeth in practice, Willis showed how to\r\n  approximate to their figure by means of two circular arcs--one\r\n  concave, for the flank, and the other convex, for the face--and each\r\n  having for its radius the _mean_ radius of curvature of the\r\n  epicycloidal arc. Willis's formulae are founded on the following\r\n  properties of epicycloids:--\r\n\r\n  Let R be the radius of the pitch-circle; r that of the describing\r\n  circle; [theta] the angle made by the normal TI to the epicycloid at a\r\n  given point T, with a tangent to the circle at I--that is, the\r\n  obliquity of the action at T.\r\n\r\n  Then the radius of curvature of the epicycloid at T is--\r\n\r\n                                                      R - r    \\\r\n    For an internal epicycloid, [rho] = 4r sin [theta]------   |\r\n                                                      R - 2r   |\r\n                                                                >  (28)\r\n                                                       R + r   |\r\n    For an external epicycloid, [rho]´ = 4r sin [theta]------  |\r\n                                                       R + 2r  /\r\n\r\n  Also, to find the position of the centres of curvature relatively to\r\n  the pitch-circle, we have, denoting the chord of the describing circle\r\n  TI by c, c = 2r sin [theta]; and therefore\r\n\r\n                                               R      \\\r\n    For the flank, [rho] - c = 2r sin [theta]------   |\r\n                                             R - 2r   |\r\n                                                       >  (29)\r\n                                                R     |\r\n    For the face, [rho]´ - c = 2r sin [theta]------   |\r\n                                             R + 2r   /\r\n\r\n\r\n  For the proportions approved of by Willis, sin [theta] = ¼ nearly; r =\r\n  p (the pitch) nearly; c = ½p nearly; and, if N be the number of teeth\r\n  in the wheel, r/R = 6/N nearly; therefore, approximately,\r\n\r\n    [rho] - c = p/2 · N/N - 12   \\  (30)\r\n    [rho]´ - c = p/2 · N/N + 12  /\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 105.]\r\n\r\n  Hence the following construction (fig. 105). Let BB be part of the\r\n  pitch-circle, and a the point where a tooth is to cross it. Set off ab\r\n  = ac - ½p. Draw radii bd, ce; draw fb, cg, making angles of 75½° with\r\n  those radii. Make bf = p´ - c, cg = p - c. From f, with the radius fa,\r\n  draw the circular arc ah; from g, with the radius ga, draw the\r\n  circular arc ak. Then ah is the face and ak the flank of the tooth\r\n  required.\r\n\r\n  To facilitate the application of this rule, Willis published tables of\r\n  [rho] - c and [rho]´ - c, and invented an instrument called the\r\n  \"odontograph.\"\r\n\r\n  § 51. _Trundles and Pin-Wheels._--If a wheel or trundle have\r\n  cylindrical pins or staves for teeth, the faces of the teeth of a\r\n  wheel suitable for driving it are described by first tracing external\r\n  epicycloids, by rolling the pitch-circle of the pin-wheel or trundle\r\n  on the pitch-circle of the driving-wheel, with the centre of a stave\r\n  for a tracing-point, and then drawing curves parallel to, and within\r\n  the epicycloids, at a distance from them equal to the radius of a\r\n  stave. Trundles having only six staves will work with large wheels.\r\n\r\n  § 52. _Backs of Teeth and Spaces._--Toothed wheels being in general\r\n  intended to rotate either way, the _backs_ of the teeth are made\r\n  similar to the fronts. The _space_ between two teeth, measured on the\r\n  pitch-circle, is made about (1/6)th part wider than the thickness of\r\n  the tooth on the pitch-circle--that is to say,\r\n\r\n    Thickness of tooth = 5/11 pitch;\r\n    Width of space = 6/11 pitch.\r\n\r\n  The difference of 1/11 of the pitch is called the _back-lash_. The\r\n  clearance allowed between the points of teeth and the bottoms of the\r\n  spaces between the teeth of the other wheel is about one-tenth of the\r\n  pitch.\r\n\r\n  § 53. _Stepped and Helical Teeth._--R. J. Hooke invented the making of\r\n  the fronts of teeth in a series of steps with a view to increase the\r\n  smoothness of action. A wheel thus formed resembles in shape a series\r\n  of equal and similar toothed disks placed side by side, with the teeth\r\n  of each a little behind those of the preceding disk. He also invented,\r\n  with the same object, teeth whose fronts, instead of being parallel to\r\n  the line of contact of the pitch-circles, cross it obliquely, so as to\r\n  be of a screw-like or helical form. In wheel-work of this kind the\r\n  contact of each pair of teeth commences at the foremost end of the\r\n  helical front, and terminates at the aftermost end; and the helix is\r\n  of such a pitch that the contact of one pair of teeth shall not\r\n  terminate until that of the next pair has commenced.\r\n\r\n  Stepped and helical teeth have the desired effect of increasing the\r\n  smoothness of motion, but they require more difficult and expensive\r\n  workmanship than common teeth; and helical teeth are, besides, open to\r\n  the objection that they exert a laterally oblique pressure, which\r\n  tends to increase resistance, and unduly strain the machinery.\r\n\r\n  § 54. _Teeth of Bevel-Wheels._--The acting surfaces of the teeth of\r\n  bevel-wheels are of the conical kind, generated by the motion of a\r\n  line passing through the common apex of the pitch-cones, while its\r\n  extremity is carried round the outlines of the cross section of the\r\n  teeth made by a sphere described about that apex.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 106.]\r\n\r\n  The operations of describing the exact figures of the teeth of\r\n  bevel-wheels, whether by involutes or by rolling curves, are in every\r\n  respect analogous to those for describing the figures of the teeth of\r\n  spur-wheels, except that in the case of bevel-wheels all those\r\n  operations are to be performed on the surface of a sphere described\r\n  about the apex instead of on a plane, substituting _poles_ for\r\n  _centres_, and _great circles_ for _straight lines_.\r\n\r\n  In consideration of the practical difficulty, especially in the case\r\n  of large wheels, of obtaining an accurate spherical surface, and of\r\n  drawing upon it when obtained, the following approximate method,\r\n  proposed originally by Tredgold, is generally used:--\r\n\r\n  Let O (fig. 106) be the common apex of a pair of bevel-wheels; OB1I,\r\n  OB2I their pitch cones; OC1, OC2 their axes; OI their line of contact.\r\n  Perpendicular to OI draw A1IA2, cutting the axes in A1, A2; make the\r\n  outer rims of the patterns and of the wheels portions of the cones\r\n  A1B1I, A2B2I, of which the narrow zones occupied by the teeth will be\r\n  sufficiently near to a spherical surface described about O for\r\n  practical purposes. To find the figures of the teeth, draw on a flat\r\n  surface circular arcs ID1, ID2, with the radii A1I, A2I; those arcs\r\n  will be the _developments_ of arcs of the pitch-circles B1I, B2I, when\r\n  the conical surfaces A1B1I, A2B2I are spread out flat. Describe the\r\n  figures of teeth for the developed arcs as for a pair of spur-wheels;\r\n  then wrap the developed arcs on the cones, so as to make them coincide\r\n  with the pitch-circles, and trace the teeth on the conical surfaces.\r\n\r\n  § 55. _Teeth of Skew-Bevel Wheels._--The crests of the teeth of a\r\n  skew-bevel wheel are parallel to the generating straight line of the\r\n  hyperboloidal pitch-surface; and the transverse sections of the teeth\r\n  at a given pitch-circle are similar to those of the teeth of a\r\n  bevel-wheel whose pitch surface is a cone touching the hyperboloidal\r\n  surface at the given circle.\r\n\r\n  § 56. _Cams._--A _cam_ is a single tooth, either rotating continuously\r\n  or oscillating, and driving a sliding or turning piece either\r\n  constantly or at intervals. All the principles which have been stated\r\n  in § 45 as being applicable to teeth are applicable to cams; but in\r\n  designing cams it is not usual to determine or take into consideration\r\n  the form of the ideal pitch-surface, which would give the same\r\n  comparative motion by rolling contact that the cam gives by sliding\r\n  contact.\r\n\r\n  § 57. _Screws._--The figure of a screw is that of a convex or concave\r\n  cylinder, with one or more helical projections, called _threads_,\r\n  winding round it. Convex and concave screws are distinguished\r\n  technically by the respective names of _male_ and _female_; a short\r\n  concave screw is called a _nut_; and when a _screw_ is spoken of\r\n  without qualification a _convex_ screw is usually understood.\r\n\r\n  The relation between the _advance_ and the _rotation_, which compose\r\n  the motion of a screw working in contact with a fixed screw or helical\r\n  guide, has already been demonstrated in § 32; and the same relation\r\n  exists between the magnitudes of the rotation of a screw about a fixed\r\n  axis and the advance of a shifting nut in which it rotates. The\r\n  advance of the nut takes place in the opposite direction to that of\r\n  the advance of the screw in the case in which the nut is fixed. The\r\n  _pitch_ or _axial pitch_ of a screw has the meaning assigned to it in\r\n  that section, viz. the distance, measured parallel to the axis,\r\n  between the corresponding points in two successive turns of the _same\r\n  thread_. If, therefore, the screw has several equidistant threads, the\r\n  true pitch is equal to the _divided axial pitch_, as measured between\r\n  two adjacent threads, multiplied by the number of threads.\r\n\r\n  If a helix be described round the screw, crossing each turn of the\r\n  thread at right angles, the distance between two corresponding points\r\n  on two successive turns of the same thread, measured along this\r\n  _normal helix_, may be called the _normal pitch_; and when the screw\r\n  has more than one thread the normal pitch from thread to thread may be\r\n  called the _normal divided pitch_.\r\n\r\n  The distance from thread to thread, measured on a circle described\r\n  about the axis of the screw, called the pitch-circle, may be called\r\n  the _circumferential pitch_; for a screw of one thread it is one\r\n  circumference; for a screw of n threads, (one circumference)/n.\r\n\r\n  Let r denote the radius of the pitch circle;\r\n    n the number of threads;\r\n    [theta] the obliquity of the threads to the pitch circle, and of the\r\n       normal helix to the axis;\r\n\r\n          P_a \\             / pitch\r\n    P_a        > the axial <\r\n    --- = p_a |             |\r\n     n        /             \\ divided pitch;\r\n\r\n           P_n \\              / pitch\r\n    P_n         > the normal <\r\n    ---  = p_n |              |\r\n     n         /              \\ divided pitch;\r\n\r\n    P_c the circumferential pitch;\r\n\r\n  then\r\n\r\n                                              2[pi]r               \\\r\n    p_c = p_a cot [theta] = p_n cos [theta] = ------,              |\r\n                                                 n                 |\r\n                                                                   |\r\n                                              2[pi]r tan [theta]   |\r\n    p_a = p_n sec [theta] = p_c tan [theta] = ------------------,   >  (31)\r\n                                                      n            |\r\n                                                                   |\r\n                                              2[pi]r sin [theta]   |\r\n    p_n = p_c sin [theta] = p_a cos [theta] = ------------------,  |\r\n                                                      n            /\r\n\r\n  If a screw rotates, the number of threads which pass a fixed point in\r\n  one revolution is the number of threads in the screw.\r\n\r\n  A pair of convex screws, each rotating about its axis, are used as an\r\n  elementary combination to transmit motion by the sliding contact of\r\n  their threads. Such screws are commonly called _endless screws_. At\r\n  the point of contact of the screws their threads must be parallel; and\r\n  their line of connexion is the common perpendicular to the acting\r\n  surfaces of the threads at their point of contact. Hence the following\r\n  principles:--\r\n\r\n  I. If the screws are both right-handed or both left-handed, the angle\r\n  between the directions of their axes is the sum of their obliquities;\r\n  if one is right-handed and the other left-handed, that angle is the\r\n  difference of their obliquities.\r\n\r\n  II. The normal pitch for a screw of one thread, and the normal divided\r\n  pitch for a screw of more than one thread, must be the same in each\r\n  screw.\r\n\r\n  III. The angular velocities of the screws are inversely as their\r\n  numbers of threads.\r\n\r\n  Hooke's wheels with oblique or helical teeth are in fact screws of\r\n  many threads, and of large diameters as compared with their lengths.\r\n\r\n  The ordinary position of a pair of endless screws is with their axes\r\n  at right angles to each other. When one is of considerably greater\r\n  diameter than the other, the larger is commonly called in practice a\r\n  _wheel_, the name _screw_ being applied to the smaller only; but they\r\n  are nevertheless both screws in fact.\r\n\r\n  To make the teeth of a pair of endless screws fit correctly and work\r\n  smoothly, a hardened steel screw is made of the figure of the smaller\r\n  screw, with its thread or threads notched so as to form a cutting\r\n  tool; the larger screw, or \"wheel,\" is cast approximately of the\r\n  required figure; the larger screw and the steel screw are fitted up in\r\n  their proper relative position, and made to rotate in contact with\r\n  each other by turning the steel screw, which cuts the threads of the\r\n  larger screw to their true figure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 107.]\r\n\r\n  § 58. _Coupling of Parallel Axes--Oldham's Coupling._--A _coupling_ is\r\n  a mode of connecting a pair of shafts so that they shall rotate in the\r\n  same direction with the same mean angular velocity. If the axes of the\r\n  shafts are in the same straight line, the coupling consists in so\r\n  connecting their contiguous ends that they shall rotate as one piece;\r\n  but if the axes are not in the same straight line combinations of\r\n  mechanism are required. A coupling for parallel shafts which acts by\r\n  _sliding contact_ was invented by Oldham, and is represented in fig.\r\n  107. C1, C2 are the axes of the two parallel shafts; D1, D2 two disks\r\n  facing each other, fixed on the ends of the two shafts respectively;\r\n  E1E1 a bar sliding in a diametral groove in the face of D1; E2E2 a bar\r\n  sliding in a diametral groove in the face of D2: those bars are fixed\r\n  together at A, so as to form a rigid cross. The angular velocities of\r\n  the two disks and of the cross are all equal at every instant; the\r\n  middle point of the cross, at A, revolves in the dotted circle\r\n  described upon the line of centres C1C2 as a diameter twice for each\r\n  turn of the disks and cross; the instantaneous axis of rotation of the\r\n  cross at any instant is at I, the point in the circle C1C2\r\n  diametrically opposite to A.\r\n\r\n  Oldham's coupling may be used with advantage where the axes of the\r\n  shafts are intended to be as nearly in the same straight line as is\r\n  possible, but where there is some doubt as to the practibility or\r\n  permanency of their exact continuity.\r\n\r\n  § 59. _Wrapping Connectors--Belts, Cords and Chains._--Flat belts of\r\n  leather or of gutta percha, round cords of catgut, hemp or other\r\n  material, and metal chains are used as wrapping connectors to transmit\r\n  rotatory motion between pairs of pulleys and drums.\r\n\r\n  _Belts_ (the most frequently used of all wrapping connectors) require\r\n  nearly cylindrical pulleys. A belt tends to move towards that part of\r\n  a pulley whose radius is greatest; pulleys for belts, therefore, are\r\n  slightly swelled in the middle, in order that the belt may remain on\r\n  the pulley, unless forcibly shifted. A belt when in motion is shifted\r\n  off a pulley, or from one pulley on to another of equal size alongside\r\n  of it, by pressing against that part of the belt which is moving\r\n  _towards_ the pulley.\r\n\r\n  _Cords_ require either cylindrical drums with ledges or grooved\r\n  pulleys.\r\n\r\n  _Chains_ require pulleys or drums, grooved, notched and toothed, so as\r\n  to fit the links of the chain.\r\n\r\n  Wrapping connectors for communicating continuous motion are endless.\r\n\r\n  Wrapping connectors for communicating reciprocating motion have\r\n  usually their ends made fast to the pulleys or drums which they\r\n  connect, and which in this case may be sectors.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 108.]\r\n\r\n  The line of connexion of two pieces connected by a wrapping connector\r\n  is the centre line of the belt, cord or chain; and the comparative\r\n  motions of the pieces are determined by the principles of § 36 if both\r\n  pieces turn, and of § 37 if one turns and the other shifts, in which\r\n  latter case the motion must be reciprocating.\r\n\r\n  The _pitch-line_ of a pulley or drum is a curve to which the line of\r\n  connexion is always a tangent--that is to say, it is a curve parallel\r\n  to the acting surface of the pulley or drum, and distant from it by\r\n  half the thickness of the wrapping connector.\r\n\r\n  Pulleys and drums for communicating a constant velocity ratio are\r\n  circular. The _effective radius_, or radius of the pitch-circle of a\r\n  circular pulley or drum, is equal to the real radius added to half the\r\n  thickness of the connector. The angular velocities of a pair of\r\n  connected circular pulleys or drums are inversely as the effective\r\n  radii.\r\n\r\n  A _crossed_ belt, as in fig. 108, A, reverses the direction of the\r\n  rotation communicated; an _uncrossed_ belt, as in fig. 108, B,\r\n  preserves that direction.\r\n\r\n  The _length_ L of an endless belt connecting a pair of pulleys whose\r\n  effective radii are r1, r2, with parallel axes whose distance apart is\r\n  c, is given by the following formulae, in each of which the first\r\n  term, containing the radical, expresses the length of the straight\r\n  parts of the belt, and the remainder of the formula the length of the\r\n  curved parts.\r\n\r\n  For a crossed belt:--\r\n\r\n                                             /                r1 + r2 \\\r\n    L = 2[root][c² - (r1 + r2)²] + (r1 + r2)( [pi] - 2 sin^-1 -------  );  (32 A)\r\n                                             \\                   c    /\r\n  and for an uncrossed belt:--\r\n\r\n                                                                    r1 - r2\r\n    L = 2[root][c² - (r1 - r2)²] + [pi](r1 + r2 + 2(r1 - r2) sin^-1 -------;  (32 B)\r\n                                                                       c\r\n  in which r1 is the greater radius, and r2 the less.\r\n\r\n  When the axes of a pair of pulleys are not parallel, the pulleys\r\n  should be so placed that the part of the belt which is _approaching_\r\n  each pulley shall be in the plane of the pulley.\r\n\r\n  § 60. _Speed-Cones._--A pair of speed-cones (fig. 109) is a\r\n  contrivance for varying and adjusting the velocity ratio communicated\r\n  between a pair of parallel shafts by means of a belt. The speed-cones\r\n  are either continuous cones or conoids, as A, B, whose velocity ratio\r\n  can be varied gradually while they are in motion by shifting the belt,\r\n  or sets of pulleys whose radii vary by steps, as C, D, in which case\r\n  the velocity ratio can be changed by shifting the belt from one pair\r\n  of pulleys to another.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 109.]\r\n\r\n  In order that the belt may fit accurately in every possible position\r\n  on a pair of speed-cones, the quantity L must be constant, in\r\n  equations (32 A) or (32 B), according as the belt is crossed or\r\n  uncrossed.\r\n\r\n  For a _crossed_ belt, as in A and C, fig. 109, L depends solely on c\r\n  and on r1 + r2. Now c is constant because the axes are parallel;\r\n  therefore the _sum of the radii_ of the pitch-circles connected in\r\n  every position of the belt is to be constant. That condition is\r\n  fulfilled by a pair of continuous cones generated by the revolution of\r\n  two straight lines inclined opposite ways to their respective axes at\r\n  equal angles.\r\n\r\n  For an uncrossed belt, the quantity L in equation (32 B) is to be made\r\n  constant. The exact fulfilment of this condition requires the solution\r\n  of a transcendental equation; but it may be fulfilled with accuracy\r\n  sufficient for practical purposes by using, instead of (32 B) the\r\n  following _approximate_ equation:--\r\n\r\n    L nearly = 2c + [pi](r1 + r2) + (r1 - r2)²/c.  (33)\r\n\r\n  The following is the most convenient practical rule for the\r\n  application of this equation:--\r\n\r\n  Let the speed-cones be equal and similar conoids, as in B, fig. 109,\r\n  but with their large and small ends turned opposite ways. Let r1 be\r\n  the radius of the large end of each, r2 that of the small end, r0 that\r\n  of the middle; and let v be the _sagitta_, measured perpendicular to\r\n  the axes, of the arc by whose revolution each of the conoids is\r\n  generated, or, in other words, the _bulging_ of the conoids in the\r\n  middle of their length. Then\r\n\r\n    v = r0 - (r1 + r2)/2 = (r1 - r2)²/2[pi]c.  (34)\r\n\r\n  2[pi] = 6.2832; but 6 may be used in most practical cases without\r\n  sensible error.\r\n\r\n  The radii at the middle and end being thus determined, make the\r\n  generating curve an arc either of a circle or of a parabola.\r\n\r\n  § 61. _Linkwork in General._--The pieces which are connected by\r\n  linkwork, if they rotate or oscillate, are usually called _cranks_,\r\n  _beams_ and levers. The _link_ by which they are connected is a rigid\r\n  rod or bar, which may be straight or of any other figure; the straight\r\n  figure being the most favourable to strength, is always used when\r\n  there is no special reason to the contrary. The link is known by\r\n  various names in various circumstances, such as _coupling-rod_,\r\n  _connecting-rod_, _crank-rod_, _eccentric-rod_, &c. It is attached to\r\n  the pieces which it connects by two pins, about which it is free to\r\n  turn. The effect of the link is to maintain the distance between the\r\n  axes of those pins invariable; hence the common perpendicular of the\r\n  axes of the pins is _the line of connexion_, and its extremities may\r\n  be called the _connected points_. In a turning piece, the\r\n  perpendicular let fall from its connected point upon its axis of\r\n  rotation is the _arm_ or _crank-arm_.\r\n\r\n  The axes of rotation of a pair of turning pieces connected by a link\r\n  are almost always parallel, and perpendicular to the line of connexion\r\n  in which case the angular velocity ratio at any instant is the\r\n  reciprocal of the ratio of the common perpendiculars let fall from the\r\n  line of connexion upon the respective axes of rotation.\r\n\r\n  If at any instant the direction of one of the crank-arms coincides\r\n  with the line of connexion, the common perpendicular of the line of\r\n  connexion and the axis of that crank-arm vanishes, and the directional\r\n  relation of the motions becomes indeterminate. The position of the\r\n  connected point of the crank-arm in question at such an instant is\r\n  called a _dead-point_. The velocity of the other connected point at\r\n  such an instant is null, unless it also reaches a dead-point at the\r\n  same instant, so that the line of connexion is in the plane of the two\r\n  axes of rotation, in which case the velocity ratio is indeterminate.\r\n  Examples of dead-points, and of the means of preventing the\r\n  inconvenience which they tend to occasion, will appear in the sequel.\r\n\r\n  § 62. _Coupling of Parallel Axes._--Two or more parallel shafts (such\r\n  as those of a locomotive engine, with two or more pairs of driving\r\n  wheels) are made to rotate with constantly equal angular velocities by\r\n  having equal cranks, which are maintained parallel by a coupling-rod\r\n  of such a length that the line of connexion is equal to the distance\r\n  between the axes. The cranks pass their dead-points simultaneously. To\r\n  obviate the unsteadiness of motion which this tends to cause, the\r\n  shafts are provided with a second set of cranks at right angles to the\r\n  first, connected by means of a similar coupling-rod, so that one set\r\n  of cranks pass their dead points at the instant when the other set are\r\n  farthest from theirs.\r\n\r\n  § 63. _Comparative Motion of Connected Points._--As the link is a\r\n  rigid body, it is obvious that its action in communicating motion may\r\n  be determined by finding the comparative motion of the connected\r\n  points, and this is often the most convenient method of proceeding.\r\n\r\n  If a connected point belongs to a turning piece, the direction of its\r\n  motion at a given instant is perpendicular to the plane containing the\r\n  axis and crank-arm of the piece. If a connected point belongs to a\r\n  shifting piece, the direction of its motion at any instant is given,\r\n  and a plane can be drawn perpendicular to that direction.\r\n\r\n  The line of intersection of the planes perpendicular to the paths of\r\n  the two connected points at a given instant is the _instantaneous axis\r\n  of the link_ at that instant; and the _velocities of the connected\r\n  points are directly as their distances from that axis_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 110.]\r\n\r\n  In drawing on a plane surface, the two planes perpendicular to the\r\n  paths of the connected points are represented by two lines (being\r\n  their sections by a plane normal to them), and the instantaneous axis\r\n  by a point (fig. 110); and, should the length of the two lines render\r\n  it impracticable to produce them until they actually intersect, the\r\n  velocity ratio of the connected points may be found by the principle\r\n  that it is equal to the ratio of the segments which a line parallel to\r\n  the line of connexion cuts off from any two lines drawn from a given\r\n  point, perpendicular respectively to the paths of the connected\r\n  points.\r\n\r\n  To illustrate this by one example. Let C1 be the axis, and T1 the\r\n  connected point of the beam of a steam-engine; T1T2 the connecting or\r\n  crank-rod; T2 the other connected point, and the centre of the\r\n  crank-pin; C2 the axis of the crank and its shaft. Let v1 denote the\r\n  velocity of T1 at any given instant; v2 that of T2. To find the ratio\r\n  of these velocities, produce C1T1, C2T2 till they intersect in K; K is\r\n  the instantaneous axis of the connecting rod, and the velocity ratio\r\n  is\r\n\r\n    v1 : v2 :: KT1 : KT2.  (35)\r\n\r\n  Should K be inconveniently far off, draw any triangle with its sides\r\n  respectively parallel to C1T1, C2T2 and T1T2; the ratio of the two\r\n  sides first mentioned will be the velocity ratio required. For\r\n  example, draw C2A parallel to C1T1, cutting T1T2 in A; then\r\n\r\n    v1 : v2 :: C2A : C2T2.  (36)\r\n\r\n  § 64. _Eccentric._--An eccentric circular disk fixed on a shaft, and\r\n  used to give a reciprocating motion to a rod, is in effect a crank-pin\r\n  of sufficiently large diameter to surround the shaft, and so to avoid\r\n  the weakening of the shaft which would arise from bending it so as to\r\n  form an ordinary crank. The centre of the eccentric is its connected\r\n  point; and its eccentricity, or the distance from that centre to the\r\n  axis of the shaft, is its crank-arm.\r\n\r\n  An eccentric may be made capable of having its eccentricity altered by\r\n  means of an adjusting screw, so as to vary the extent of the\r\n  reciprocating motion which it communicates.\r\n\r\n  § 65. _Reciprocating Pieces--Stroke--Dead-Points._--The distance\r\n  between the extremities of the path of the connected point in a\r\n  reciprocating piece (such as the piston of a steam-engine) is called\r\n  the _stroke_ or _length of stroke_ of that piece. When it is connected\r\n  with a continuously turning piece (such as the crank of a\r\n  steam-engine) the ends of the stroke of the reciprocating piece\r\n  correspond to the _dead-points_ of the path of the connected point of\r\n  the turning piece, where the line of connexion is continuous with or\r\n  coincides with the crank-arm.\r\n\r\n  Let S be the length of stroke of the reciprocating piece, L the length\r\n  of the line of connexion, and R the crank-arm of the continuously\r\n  turning piece. Then, if the two ends of the stroke be in one straight\r\n  line with the axis of the crank,\r\n\r\n    S = 2R;  (37)\r\n\r\n  and if these ends be not in one straight line with that axis, then S,\r\n  L - R, and L + R, are the three sides of a triangle, having the angle\r\n  opposite S at that axis; so that, if [theta] be the supplement of the\r\n  arc between the dead-points,\r\n\r\n    S² = 2(L² + R²) - 2(L² - R²) cos [theta], \\\r\n                                              |\r\n                  2L² + 2R² - S²               >  (38)\r\n    cos [theta] = --------------              |\r\n                    2(L² - R²)                /\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 111.]\r\n\r\n  § 66. _Coupling of Intersecting Axes--Hooke's Universal\r\n  Joint._--Intersecting axes are coupled by a contrivance of Hooke's,\r\n  known as the \"universal joint,\" which belongs to the class of linkwork\r\n  (see fig. 111). Let O be the point of intersection of the axes OC1,\r\n  OC2, and [theta] their angle of inclination to each other. The pair of\r\n  shafts C1, C2 terminate in a pair of forks F1, F2 in bearings at the\r\n  extremities of which turn the gudgeons at the ends of the arms of a\r\n  rectangular cross, having its centre at O. This cross is the link; the\r\n  connected points are the centres of the bearings F1, F2. At each\r\n  instant each of those points moves at right angles to the central\r\n  plane of its shaft and fork, therefore the line of intersection of the\r\n  central planes of the two forks at any instant is the instantaneous\r\n  axis of the cross, and the _velocity ratio_ of the points F1, F2\r\n  (which, as the forks are equal, is also the _angular velocity ratio_\r\n  of the shafts) is equal to the ratio of the distances of those points\r\n  from that instantaneous axis. The _mean_ value of that velocity ratio\r\n  is that of equality, for each successive _quarter-turn_ is made by\r\n  both shafts in the same time; but its actual value fluctuates between\r\n  the limits:--\r\n\r\n    [alpha]2        1                                      \\\r\n    -------- = -----------  when F1 is the plane of OC1C2  |\r\n    [alpha]1   cos [theta]                                 |\r\n                                                            > (39)\r\n        [alpha]2                                           |\r\n    and --------  = cos [theta] when F2 is in that plane.  |\r\n        [alpha]1                                           /\r\n\r\n  Its value at intermediate instants is given by the following\r\n  equations: let [phi]1, [phi]2 be the angles respectively made by the\r\n  central planes of the forks and shafts with the plane OC1C2 at a given\r\n  instant; then\r\n\r\n    cos [theta] = tan [phi]1 tan [phi]2,             \\\r\n                                                     |\r\n    [alpha]2      d[phi]2   tan [phi]1 + cot [phi]1   > (40)\r\n    --------- = - ------- = -----------------------. |\r\n    [alpha]1      d[phi]1   tan [phi]2 + cot [phi]2  /\r\n\r\n  § 67. _Intermittent Linkwork--Click and Ratchet._--A click acting upon\r\n  a ratchet-wheel or rack, which it pushes or pulls through a certain\r\n  arc at each forward stroke and leaves at rest at each backward stroke,\r\n  is an example of intermittent linkwork. During the forward stroke the\r\n  action of the click is governed by the principles of linkwork; during\r\n  the backward stroke that action ceases. A _catch_ or _pall_, turning\r\n  on a fixed axis, prevents the ratchet-wheel or rack from reversing its\r\n  motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Division 5.--Trains of Mechanism._\r\n\r\n  § 68. _General Principles.--A train of mechanism_ consists of a series\r\n  of pieces each of which is follower to that which drives it and driver\r\n  to that which follows it.\r\n\r\n  The comparative motion of the first driver and last follower is\r\n  obtained by combining the proportions expressing by their terms the\r\n  velocity ratios and by their signs the directional relations of the\r\n  several elementary combinations of which the train consists.\r\n\r\n  § 69. _Trains of Wheelwork._--Let A1, A2, A3, &c., A_(m-1), A_m denote\r\n  a series of axes, and [alpha]1, [alpha]2, [alpha]3, &c.,\r\n  [alpha]_(m-1), [alpha]_m their angular velocities. Let the axis A1\r\n  carry a wheel of N1 teeth, driving a wheel of n2 teeth on the axis A2,\r\n  which carries also a wheel of N2 teeth, driving a wheel of n3 teeth on\r\n  the axis A3, and so on; the numbers of teeth in drivers being denoted\r\n  by N´s, and in followers by n's, and the axes to which the wheels are\r\n  fixed being denoted by numbers. Then the resulting velocity ratio is\r\n  denoted by\r\n\r\n    [alpha]_m   [alpha]2   [alpha]3            [alpha]_m      N1 · N2 ... &c. ... N_(m-1)\r\n    --------- = -------- · -------- · &c. ... ------------- = ---------------------------;  (41)\r\n    [alpha]1    [alpha]1   [alpha]2           [alpha]_(m-1)     n2 · n3 ... &c. ... n_m\r\n\r\n  that is to say, the velocity ratio of the last and first axes is the\r\n  ratio of the product of the numbers of teeth in the drivers to the\r\n  product of the numbers of teeth in the followers.\r\n\r\n  Supposing all the wheels to be in outside gearing, then, as each\r\n  elementary combination reverses the direction of rotation, and as the\r\n  number of elementary combinations m - 1 is one less than the number\r\n  of axes m, it is evident that if m is odd the direction of rotation is\r\n  preserved, and if even reversed.\r\n\r\n  It is often a question of importance to determine the number of teeth\r\n  in a train of wheels best suited for giving a determinate velocity\r\n  ratio to two axes. It was shown by Young that, to do this with the\r\n  _least total number of teeth_, the velocity ratio of each elementary\r\n  combination should approximate as nearly as possible to 3.59. This\r\n  would in many cases give too many axes; and, as a useful practical\r\n  rule, it may be laid down that from 3 to 6 ought to be the limit of\r\n  the velocity ratio of an elementary combination in wheel-work. The\r\n  smallest number of teeth in a pinion for epicycloidal teeth ought to\r\n  be _twelve_ (see § 49)--but it is better, for smoothness of motion,\r\n  not to go below _fifteen_; and for involute teeth the smallest number\r\n  is about _twenty-four_.\r\n\r\n  Let B/C be the velocity ratio required, reduced to its least terms,\r\n  and let B be greater than C. If B/C is not greater than 6, and C lies\r\n  between the prescribed minimum number of teeth (which may be called t)\r\n  and its double 2t, then one pair of wheels will answer the purpose,\r\n  and B and C will themselves be the numbers required. Should B and C be\r\n  inconveniently large, they are, if possible, to be resolved into\r\n  factors, and those factors (or if they are too small, multiples of\r\n  them) used for the number of teeth. Should B or C, or both, be at once\r\n  inconveniently large and prime, then, instead of the exact ratio B/C\r\n  some ratio approximating to that ratio, and capable of resolution into\r\n  convenient factors, is to be found by the method of continued\r\n  fractions.\r\n\r\n  Should B/C be greater than 6, the best number of elementary\r\n  combinations m - 1 will lie between\r\n\r\n    (log B - log C)     log B - log C\r\n    --------------- and -------------.\r\n         log 6              log 3\r\n\r\n  Then, if possible, B and C themselves are to be resolved each into m -\r\n  1 factors (counting 1 as a factor), which factors, or multiples of\r\n  them, shall be not less than t nor greater than 6t; or if B and C\r\n  contain inconveniently large prime factors, an approximate velocity\r\n  ratio, found by the method of continued fractions, is to be\r\n  substituted for B/C as before.\r\n\r\n  So far as the resultant velocity ratio is concerned, the _order_ of\r\n  the drivers N and of the followers n is immaterial: but to secure\r\n  equable wear of the teeth, as explained in § 44, the wheels ought to\r\n  be so arranged that, for each elementary combination, the greatest\r\n  common divisor of N and n shall be either 1, or as small as possible.\r\n\r\n  § 70. _Double Hooke's Coupling._--It has been shown in § 66 that the\r\n  velocity ratio of a pair of shafts coupled by a universal joint\r\n  fluctuates between the limits cos [theta] and 1/cos [theta]. Hence one\r\n  or both of the shafts must have a vibratory and unsteady motion,\r\n  injurious to the mechanism and framework. To obviate this evil a short\r\n  intermediate shaft is introduced, making equal angles with the first\r\n  and last shaft, coupled with each of them by a Hooke's joint, and\r\n  having its own two forks in the same plane. Let [alpha]1, [alpha]2,\r\n  [alpha]3 be the angular velocities of the first, intermediate, and\r\n  last shaft in this _train of two Hooke's couplings_. Then, from the\r\n  principles of § 60 it is evident that at each instant\r\n  [alpha]2/[alpha]1 = [alpha]2/[alpha]3, and consequently that [alpha]3\r\n  = [alpha]1; so that the fluctuations of angular velocity ratio caused\r\n  by the first coupling are exactly neutralized by the second, and the\r\n  first and last shafts have equal angular velocities at each instant.\r\n\r\n  § 71. _Converging and Diverging Trains of Mechanism._--Two or more\r\n  trains of mechanism may converge into one--as when the two pistons of\r\n  a pair of steam-engines, each through its own connecting-rod, act upon\r\n  one crank-shaft. One train of mechanism may _diverge_ into two or\r\n  more--as when a single shaft, driven by a prime mover, carries several\r\n  pulleys, each of which drives a different machine. The principles of\r\n  comparative motion in such converging and diverging trains are the\r\n  same as in simple trains.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Division 6.--Aggregate Combinations._\r\n\r\n  § 72. _General Principles._--Willis designated as \"aggregate\r\n  combinations\" those assemblages of pieces of mechanism in which the\r\n  motion of one follower is the _resultant_ of component motions\r\n  impressed on it by more than one driver. Two classes of aggregate\r\n  combinations may be distinguished which, though not different in their\r\n  actual nature, differ in the _data_ which they present to the\r\n  designer, and in the method of solution to be followed in questions\r\n  respecting them.\r\n\r\n  Class I. comprises those cases in which a piece A is not carried\r\n  directly by the frame C, but by another piece B, _relatively_ to which\r\n  the motion of A is given--the motion of the piece B relatively to the\r\n  frame C being also given. Then the motion of A relatively to the frame\r\n  C is the _resultant_ of the motion of A relatively to B and of B\r\n  relatively to C; and that resultant is to be found by the principles\r\n  already explained in Division 3 of this Chapter §§ 27-32.\r\n\r\n  Class II. comprises those cases in which the motions of three points\r\n  in one follower are determined by their connexions with two or with\r\n  three different drivers.\r\n\r\n  This classification is founded on the kinds of problems arising from\r\n  the combinations. Willis adopts another classification founded on the\r\n  _objects_ of the combinations, which objects he divides into two\r\n  classes, viz. (1) to produce _aggregate velocity_, or a velocity which\r\n  is the resultant of two or more components in the same path, and (2)\r\n  to produce _an aggregate path_--that is, to make a given point in a\r\n  rigid body move in an assigned path by communicating certain motions\r\n  to other points in that body.\r\n\r\n  It is seldom that one of these effects is produced without at the same\r\n  time producing the other; but the classification of Willis depends\r\n  upon which of those two effects, even supposing them to occur\r\n  together, is the practical object of the mechanism.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 112.]\r\n\r\n  § 73. _Differential Windlass._--The axis C (fig. 112) carries a larger\r\n  barrel AE and a smaller barrel DB, rotating as one piece with the\r\n  angular velocity [alpha]1 in the direction AE. The pulley or _sheave_\r\n  FG has a weight W hung to its centre. A cord has one end made fast to\r\n  and wrapped round the barrel AE; it passes from A under the sheave FG,\r\n  and has the other end wrapped round and made fast to the barrel BD.\r\n  Required the relation between the velocity of translation v2 of W and\r\n  the angular velocity [alpha]1 of the _differential barrel_.\r\n\r\n  In this case v2 is an _aggregate velocity_, produced by the joint\r\n  action of the two drivers AE and BD, transmitted by wrapping\r\n  connectors to FG, and combined by that sheave so as to act on the\r\n  follower W, whose motion is the same with that of the centre of FG.\r\n\r\n  The velocity of the point F is [alpha]1·AC, _upward_ motion being\r\n  considered positive. The velocity of the point G is -[alpha]1·CB,\r\n  _downward_ motion being negative. Hence the instantaneous axis of the\r\n  sheave FG is in the diameter FG, at the distance\r\n\r\n    FG     AC - BC\r\n    --- ·  -------\r\n     2     AC + BC\r\n\r\n  from the centre towards G; the angular velocity of the sheave is\r\n\r\n                          AC + BC\r\n    [alpha]2 = [alpha]1 · -------;\r\n                             FG\r\n\r\n  and, consequently, the velocity of its centre is\r\n\r\n                    FG    AC - BC   [alpha]1(AC - BC)\r\n    v2 = [alpha]2 · --- · ------- = -----------------,  (42)\r\n                     2    AC + BC           2\r\n\r\n  or the _mean between the velocities of the two vertical parts of the\r\n  cord_.\r\n\r\n  If the cord be fixed to the framework at the point B, instead of being\r\n  wound on a barrel, the velocity of W is half that of AF.\r\n\r\n  A case containing several sheaves is called a _block_. A _fall-block_\r\n  is attached to a fixed point; a _running-block_ is movable to and from\r\n  a fall-block, with which it is connected by two or more plies of a\r\n  rope. The whole combination constitutes a _tackle_ or _purchase_. (See\r\n  PULLEYS for practical applications of these principles.)\r\n\r\n  § 74. _Differential Screw._--On the same axis let there be two screws\r\n  of the respective pitches p1 and p2, made in one piece, and rotating\r\n  with the angular velocity [alpha]. Let this piece be called B. Let the\r\n  first screw turn in a fixed nut C, and the second in a sliding nut A.\r\n  The velocity of advance of B relatively to C is (according to § 32)\r\n  [alpha]p1, and of A relatively to B (according to § 57) -[alpha]p2;\r\n  hence the velocity of A relatively to C is\r\n\r\n    [alpha](p1 - p2),  (46)\r\n\r\n  being the same with the velocity of advance of a screw of the pitch p1\r\n  - p2. This combination, called _Hunter's_ or the _differential screw_,\r\n  combines the strength of a large thread with the slowness of motion\r\n  due to a small one.\r\n\r\n  § 75. _Epicyclic Trains._--The term _epicyclic train_ is used by\r\n  Willis to denote a train of wheels carried by an arm, and having\r\n  certain rotations relatively to that arm, which itself rotates. The\r\n  arm may either be driven by the wheels or assist in driving them. The\r\n  comparative motions of the wheels and of the arm, and the _aggregate\r\n  paths_ traced by points in the wheels, are determined by the\r\n  principles of the composition of rotations, and of the description of\r\n  rolling curves, explained in §§ 30, 31.\r\n\r\n  § 76. _Link Motion._--A slide valve operated by a link motion receives\r\n  an aggregate motion from the mechanism driving it. (See STEAM-ENGINE\r\n  for a description of this and other types of mechanism of this class.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 113.]\r\n\r\n  § 77. _Parallel Motions._--A _parallel motion_ is a combination of\r\n  turning pieces in mechanism designed to guide the motion of a\r\n  reciprocating piece either exactly or approximately in a straight\r\n  line, so as to avoid the friction which arises from the use of\r\n  straight guides for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 113 represents an exact parallel motion, first proposed, it is\r\n  believed, by Scott Russell. The arm CD turns on the axis C, and is\r\n  jointed at D to the middle of the bar ADB, whose length is double of\r\n  that of CD, and one of whose ends B is jointed to a slider, sliding in\r\n  straight guides along the line CB. Draw BE perpendicular to CB,\r\n  cutting CD produced in E, then E is the instantaneous axis of the bar\r\n  ADB; and the direction of motion of A is at every instant\r\n  perpendicular to EA--that is, along the straight line ACa. While the\r\n  stroke of A is ACa, extending to equal distances on either side of C,\r\n  and equal to twice the chord of the arc Dd, the stroke of B is only\r\n  equal to twice the sagitta; and thus A is guided through a\r\n  comparatively long stroke by the sliding of B through a comparatively\r\n  short stroke, and by rotatory motions at the joints C, D, B.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 114.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 115.]\r\n\r\n  § 78.* An example of an approximate straight-line motion composed of\r\n  three bars fixed to a frame is shown in fig. 114. It is due to P. L.\r\n  Tchebichev of St Petersburg. The links AB and CD are equal in length\r\n  and are centred respectively at A and C. The ends D and B are joined\r\n  by a link DB. If the respective lengths are made in the proportions AC\r\n  : CD : DB = 1 : 1.3 : 0.4 the middle point P of DB will describe an\r\n  approximately straight line parallel to AC within limits of length\r\n  about equal to AC. C. N. Peaucellier, a French engineer officer, was\r\n  the first, in 1864, to invent a linkwork with which an exact straight\r\n  line could be drawn. The linkwork is shown in fig. 115, from which it\r\n  will be seen that it consists of a rhombus of four equal bars ABCD,\r\n  jointed at opposite corners with two equal bars BE and DE. The seventh\r\n  link AF is equal in length to halt the distance EA when the mechanism\r\n  is in its central position. The points E and F are fixed. It can be\r\n  proved that the point C always moves in a straight line at right\r\n  angles to the line EF. The more general property of the mechanism\r\n  corresponding to proportions between the lengths FA and EF other than\r\n  that of equality is that the curve described by the point C is the\r\n  inverse of the curve described by A. There are other arrangements of\r\n  bars giving straight-line motions, and these arrangements together\r\n  with the general properties of mechanisms of this kind are discussed\r\n  in _How to Draw a Straight Line_ by A. B. Kempe (London, 1877).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 116.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 117.]\r\n\r\n  § 79.* _The Pantograph._--If a parallelogram of links (fig. 116), be\r\n  fixed at any one point a in any one of the links produced in either\r\n  direction, and if any straight line be drawn from this point to cut\r\n  the links in the points b and c, then the points a, b, c will be in a\r\n  straight line for all positions of the mechanism, and if the point b\r\n  be guided in any curve whatever, the point c will trace a similar\r\n  curve to a scale enlarged in the ratio ab : ac. This property of the\r\n  parallelogram is utilized in the construction of the pantograph, an\r\n  instrument used for obtaining a copy of a map or drawing on a\r\n  different scale. Professor J. J. Sylvester discovered that this\r\n  property of the parallelogram is not confined to points lying in one\r\n  line with the fixed point. Thus if b (fig. 117) be any point on the\r\n  link CD, and if a point c be taken on the link DE such that the\r\n  triangles CbD and DcE are similar and similarly situated with regard\r\n  to their respective links, then the ratio of the distances ab and ac\r\n  is constant, and the angle bac is constant for all positions of the\r\n  mechanism; so that, if b is guided in any curve, the point c will\r\n  describe a similar curve turned through an angle bac, the scales of\r\n  the curves being in the ratio ab to ac. Sylvester called an instrument\r\n  based on this property a plagiograph or a skew pantograph.\r\n\r\n  The combination of the parallelogram with a straight-line motion, for\r\n  guiding one of the points in a straight line, is illustrated in Watt's\r\n  parallel motion for steam-engines. (See STEAM-ENGINE.)\r\n\r\n  § 80.* _The Reuleaux System of Analysis._--If two pieces, A and B,\r\n  (fig. 118) are jointed together by a pin, the pin being fixed, say, to\r\n  A, the only relative motion possible between the pieces is one of\r\n  turning about the axis of the pin. Whatever motion the pair of pieces\r\n  may have as a whole each separate piece shares in common, and this\r\n  common motion in no way affects the relative motion of A and B. The\r\n  motion of one piece is said to be completely constrained relatively to\r\n  the other piece. Again, the pieces A and B (fig. 119) are paired\r\n  together as a slide, and the only relative motion possible between\r\n  them now is that of sliding, and therefore the motion of one\r\n  relatively to the other is completely constrained. The pieces may be\r\n  paired together as a screw and nut, in which case the relative motion\r\n  is compounded of turning with sliding.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 118.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 119.]\r\n\r\n  These combinations of pieces are known individually as _kinematic\r\n  pairs of elements_, or briefly _kinematic pairs_. The three pairs\r\n  mentioned above have each the peculiarity that contact between the two\r\n  pieces forming the pair is distributed over a surface. Kinematic pairs\r\n  which have surface contact are classified as _lower pairs_. Kinematic\r\n  pairs in which contact takes place along a line only are classified as\r\n  _higher pairs_. A pair of spur wheels in gear is an example of a\r\n  higher pair, because the wheels have contact between their teeth along\r\n  lines only.\r\n\r\n  A _kinematic link_ of the simplest form is made by joining up the\r\n  halves of two kinematic pairs by means of a rigid link. Thus if A1B1\r\n  represent a turning pair, and A2B2 a second turning pair, the rigid\r\n  link formed by joining B1 to B2 is a kinematic link. Four links of\r\n  this kind are shown in fig. 120 joined up to form a _closed kinematic\r\n  chain_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 120.]\r\n\r\n  In order that a kinematic chain may be made the basis of a mechanism,\r\n  every point in any link of it must be completely constrained with\r\n  regard to every other link. Thus in fig. 120 the motion of a point a\r\n  in the link A1A2 is completely constrained with regard to the link\r\n  B1B4 by the turning pair A1B1, and it can be proved that the motion of\r\n  a relatively to the non-adjacent link A3A4 is completely constrained,\r\n  and therefore the four-bar chain, as it is called, can be and is used\r\n  as the basis of many mechanisms. Another way of considering the\r\n  question of constraint is to imagine any one link of the chain fixed;\r\n  then, however the chain be moved, the path of a point, as a, will\r\n  always remain the same. In a five-bar chain, if a is a point in a link\r\n  non-adjacent to a fixed link, its path is indeterminate. Still another\r\n  way of stating the matter is to say that, if any one link in the chain\r\n  be fixed, any point in the chain must have only one degree of freedom.\r\n  In a five-bar chain a point, as a, in a link non-adjacent to the fixed\r\n  link has two degrees of freedom and the chain cannot therefore be used\r\n  for a mechanism. These principles may be applied to examine any\r\n  possible combination of links forming a kinematic chain in order to\r\n  test its suitability for use as a mechanism. Compound chains are\r\n  formed by the superposition of two or more simple chains, and in these\r\n  more complex chains links will be found carrying three, or even more,\r\n  halves of kinematic pairs. The Joy valve gear mechanism is a good\r\n  example of a compound kinematic chain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 121.]\r\n\r\n  A chain built up of three turning pairs and one sliding pair, and\r\n  known as the _slider crank chain_, is shown in fig. 121. It will be\r\n  seen that the piece A1 can only slide relatively to the piece B1, and\r\n  these two pieces therefore form the sliding pair. The piece A1 carries\r\n  the pin B4, which is one half of the turning pair A4 B4. The piece A1\r\n  together with the pin B4 therefore form a kinematic link A1B4. The\r\n  other links of the chain are, B1A2, B2B3, A3A4. In order to convert a\r\n  chain into a mechanism it is necessary to fix one link in it. Any one\r\n  of the links may be fixed. It follows therefore that there are as many\r\n  possible mechanisms as there are links in the chain. For example,\r\n  there is a well-known mechanism corresponding to the fixing of three\r\n  of the four links of the slider crank chain (fig. 121). If the link d\r\n  is fixed the chain at once becomes the mechanism of the ordinary steam\r\n  engine; if the link e is fixed the mechanism obtained is that of the\r\n  oscillating cylinder steam engine; if the link c is fixed the\r\n  mechanism becomes either the Whitworth quick-return motion or the\r\n  slot-bar motion, depending upon the proportion between the lengths of\r\n  the links c and e. These different mechanisms are called _inversions_\r\n  of the slider crank chain. What was the fixed framework of the\r\n  mechanism in one case becomes a moving link in an inversion.\r\n\r\n  The Reuleaux system, therefore, consists essentially of the analysis\r\n  of every mechanism into a kinematic chain, and since each link of the\r\n  chain may be the fixed frame of a mechanism quite diverse mechanisms\r\n  are found to be merely inversions of the same kinematic chain. Franz\r\n  Reuleaux's _Kinematics of Machinery_, translated by Sir A. B. W.\r\n  Kennedy (London, 1876), is the book in which the system is set forth\r\n  in all its completeness. In _Mechanics of Machinery_, by Sir A. B. W.\r\n  Kennedy (London, 1886), the system was used for the first time in an\r\n  English textbook, and now it has found its way into most modern\r\n  textbooks relating to the subject of mechanism.\r\n\r\n  § 81.* _Centrodes, Instantaneous Centres, Velocity Image, Velocity\r\n  Diagram._--Problems concerning the relative motion of the several\r\n  parts of a kinematic chain may be considered in two ways, in addition\r\n  to the way hitherto used in this article and based on the principle of\r\n  § 34. The first is by the method of instantaneous centres, already\r\n  exemplified in § 63, and rolling centroids, developed by Reuleaux in\r\n  connexion with his method of analysis. The second is by means of\r\n  Professor R. H. Smith's method already referred to in § 23.\r\n\r\n  _Method 1._--By reference to § 30 it will be seen that the motion of a\r\n  cylinder rolling on a fixed cylinder is one of rotation about an\r\n  instantaneous axis T, and that the velocity both as regards direction\r\n  and magnitude is the same as if the rolling piece B were for the\r\n  instant turning about a fixed axis coincident with the instantaneous\r\n  axis. If the rolling cylinder B and its path A now be assumed to\r\n  receive a common plane motion, what was before the velocity of the\r\n  point P becomes the velocity of P relatively to the cylinder A, since\r\n  the motion of B relatively to A still takes place about the\r\n  instantaneous axis T. If B stops rolling, then the two cylinders\r\n  continue to move as though they were parts of a rigid body. Notice\r\n  that the shape of either rolling curve (fig. 91 or 92) may be found by\r\n  considering each fixed in turn and then tracing out the locus of the\r\n  instantaneous axis. These rolling cylinders are sometimes called\r\n  axodes, and a section of an axode in a plane parallel to the plane of\r\n  motion is called a centrode. The axode is hence the locus of the\r\n  instantaneous axis, whilst the centrode is the locus of the\r\n  instantaneous centre in any plane parallel to the plane of motion.\r\n  There is no restriction on the shape of these rolling axodes; they may\r\n  have any shape consistent with rolling (that is, no slipping is\r\n  permitted), and the relative velocity of a point P is still found by\r\n  considering it with regard to the instantaneous centre.\r\n\r\n  Reuleaux has shown that the relative motion of any pair of\r\n  non-adjacent links of a kinematic chain is determined by the rolling\r\n  together of two ideal cylindrical surfaces (cylindrical being used\r\n  here in the general sense), each of which may be assumed to be formed\r\n  by the extension of the material of the link to which it corresponds.\r\n  These surfaces have contact at the instantaneous axis, which is now\r\n  called the instantaneous axis of the two links concerned. To find the\r\n  form of these surfaces corresponding to a particular pair of\r\n  non-adjacent links, consider each link of the pair fixed in turn, then\r\n  the locus of the instantaneous axis is the axode corresponding to the\r\n  fixed link, or, considering a plane of motion only, the locus of the\r\n  instantaneous centre is the centrode corresponding to the fixed link.\r\n\r\n  To find the instantaneous centre for a particular link corresponding\r\n  to any given configuration of the kinematic chain, it is only\r\n  necessary to know the direction of motion of any two points in the\r\n  link, since lines through these points respectively at right angles to\r\n  their directions of motion intersect in the instantaneous centre.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 122.]\r\n\r\n  To illustrate this principle, consider the four-bar chain shown in\r\n  fig. 122 made up of the four links, a, b, c, d. Let a be the fixed\r\n  link, and consider the link c. Its extremities are moving respectively\r\n  in directions at right angles to the links b and d; hence produce the\r\n  links b and d to meet in the point O_(ac). This point is the\r\n  instantaneous centre of the motion of the link c relatively to the\r\n  fixed link a, a fact indicated by the suffix ac placed after the\r\n  letter O. The process being repeated for different values of the angle\r\n  [theta] the curve through the several points Oac is the centroid which\r\n  may be imagined as formed by an extension of the material of the link\r\n  a. To find the corresponding centroid for the link c, fix c and repeat\r\n  the process. Again, imagine d fixed, then the instantaneous centre\r\n  O_(bd) of b with regard to d is found by producing the links c and a\r\n  to intersect in O_(bd), and the shapes of the centroids belonging\r\n  respectively to the links b and d can be found as before. The axis\r\n  about which a pair of adjacent links turn is a permanent axis, and is\r\n  of course the axis of the pin which forms the point. Adding the\r\n  centres corresponding to these several axes to the figure, it will be\r\n  seen that there are six centres in connexion with the four-bar chain\r\n  of which four are permanent and two are instantaneous or virtual\r\n  centres; and, further, that whatever be the configuration of the chain\r\n  these centres group themselves into three sets of three, each set\r\n  lying on a straight line. This peculiarity is not an accident or a\r\n  special property of the four-bar chain, but is an illustration of a\r\n  general law regarding the subject discovered by Aronhold and Sir A. B.\r\n  W. Kennedy independently, which may be thus stated: If any three\r\n  bodies, a, b, c, have plane motion their three virtual centres,\r\n  O_(ab), O_(bc), O_(ac), are three points on one straight line. A proof\r\n  of this will be found in _The Mechanics of Machinery_ quoted above.\r\n  Having obtained the set of instantaneous centres for a chain, suppose\r\n  a is the fixed link of the chain and c any other link; then O_(ac) is\r\n  the instantaneous centre of the two links and may be considered for\r\n  the instant as the trace of an axis fixed to an extension of the link\r\n  a about which c is turning, and thus problems of instantaneous\r\n  velocity concerning the link c are solved as though the link c were\r\n  merely rotating for the instant about a fixed axis coincident with the\r\n  instantaneous axis.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 123.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 124.]\r\n\r\n  _Method 2._--The second method is based upon the vector representation\r\n  of velocity, and may be illustrated by applying it to the four-bar\r\n  chain. Let AD (fig. 123) be the fixed link. Consider the link BC, and\r\n  let it be required to find the velocity of the point B having given\r\n  the velocity of the point C. The principle upon which the solution is\r\n  based is that the only motion which B can have relatively to an axis\r\n  through C fixed to the link CD is one of turning about C. Choose any\r\n  pole O (fig. 124). From this pole set out Oc to represent the velocity\r\n  of the point C. The direction of this must be at right angles to the\r\n  line CD, because this is the only direction possible to the point C.\r\n  If the link BC moves without turning, Oc will also represent the\r\n  velocity of the point B; but, if the link is turning, B can only move\r\n  about the axis C, and its direction of motion is therefore at right\r\n  angles to the line CB. Hence set out the possible direction of B´s\r\n  motion in the velocity diagram, namely cb1, at right angles to CB. But\r\n  the point B must also move at right angles to AB in the case under\r\n  consideration. Hence draw a line through O in the velocity diagram at\r\n  right angles to AB to cut cb1 in b. Then Ob is the velocity of the\r\n  point b in magnitude and direction, and cb is the tangential velocity\r\n  of B relatively to C. Moreover, whatever be the actual magnitudes of\r\n  the velocities, the instantaneous velocity ratio of the points C and B\r\n  is given by the ratio Oc/Ob.\r\n\r\n  A most important property of the diagram (figs. 123 and 124) is the\r\n  following: If points X and x are taken dividing the link BC and the\r\n  tangential velocity cb, so that cx:xb = CX:XB, then Ox represents the\r\n  velocity of the point X in magnitude and direction. The line cb has\r\n  been called the _velocity image_ of the rod, since it may be looked\r\n  upon as a scale drawing of the rod turned through 90° from the actual\r\n  rod. Or, put in another way, if the link CB is drawn to scale on the\r\n  new length cb in the velocity diagram (fig. 124), then a vector drawn\r\n  from O to any point on the new drawing of the rod will represent the\r\n  velocity of that point of the actual rod in magnitude and direction.\r\n  It will be understood that there is a new velocity diagram for every\r\n  new configuration of the mechanism, and that in each new diagram the\r\n  image of the rod will be different in scale. Following the method\r\n  indicated above for a kinematic chain in general, there will be\r\n  obtained a velocity diagram similar to that of fig. 124 for each\r\n  configuration of the mechanism, a diagram in which the velocity of the\r\n  several points in the chain utilized for drawing the diagram will\r\n  appear to the same scale, all radiating from the pole O. The lines\r\n  joining the ends of these several velocities are the several\r\n  tangential velocities, each being the velocity image of a link in the\r\n  chain. These several images are not to the same scale, so that\r\n  although the images may be considered to form collectively an image of\r\n  the chain itself, the several members of this chain-image are to\r\n  different scales in any one velocity diagram, and thus the chain-image\r\n  is distorted from the actual proportions of the mechanism which it\r\n  represents.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 125.]\r\n\r\n  § 82.* _Acceleration Diagram. Acceleration Image._--Although it is\r\n  possible to obtain the acceleration of points in a kinematic chain\r\n  with one link fixed by methods which utilize the instantaneous centres\r\n  of the chain, the vector method more readily lends itself to this\r\n  purpose. It should be understood that the instantaneous centre\r\n  considered in the preceding paragraphs is available only for\r\n  estimating relative velocities; it cannot be used in a similar manner\r\n  for questions regarding acceleration. That is to say, although the\r\n  instantaneous centre is a centre of no velocity for the instant, it is\r\n  not a centre of no acceleration, and in fact the centre of no\r\n  acceleration is in general a quite different point. The general\r\n  principle on which the method of drawing an acceleration diagram\r\n  depends is that if a link CB (fig. 125) have plane motion and the\r\n  acceleration of any point C be given in magnitude and direction, the\r\n  acceleration of any other point B is the vector sum of the\r\n  acceleration of C, the radial acceleration of B about C and the\r\n  tangential acceleration of B about C. Let A be any origin, and let Ac\r\n  represent the acceleration of the point C, ct the radial acceleration\r\n  of B about C which must be in a direction parallel to BC, and tb the\r\n  tangential acceleration of B about C, which must of course be at right\r\n  angles to ct; then the vector sum of these three magnitudes is Ab, and\r\n  this vector represents the acceleration of the point B. The directions\r\n  of the radial and tangential accelerations of the point B are always\r\n  known when the position of the link is assigned, since these are to be\r\n  drawn respectively parallel to and at right angles to the link itself.\r\n  The magnitude of the radial acceleration is given by the expression\r\n  v²/BC, v being the velocity of the point B about the point C. This\r\n  velocity can always be found from the velocity diagram of the chain of\r\n  which the link forms a part. If dw/dt is the angular acceleration of\r\n  the link, dw/dt × CB is the tangential acceleration of the point B\r\n  about the point C. Generally this tangential acceleration is unknown\r\n  in magnitude, and it becomes part of the problem to find it. An\r\n  important property of the diagram is that if points X and x are taken\r\n  dividing the link CB and the whole acceleration of B about C, namely,\r\n  cb in the same ratio, then Ax represents the acceleration of the point\r\n  X in magnitude and direction; cb is called the acceleration image of\r\n  the rod. In applying this principle to the drawing of an acceleration\r\n  diagram for a mechanism, the velocity diagram of the mechanism must be\r\n  first drawn in order to afford the means of calculating the several\r\n  radial accelerations of the links. Then assuming that the acceleration\r\n  of one point of a particular link of the mechanism is known together\r\n  with the corresponding configuration of the mechanism, the two vectors\r\n  Ac and ct can be drawn. The direction of tb, the third vector in the\r\n  diagram, is also known, so that the problem is reduced to the\r\n  condition that b is somewhere on the line tb. Then other conditions\r\n  consequent upon the fact that the link forms part of a kinematic chain\r\n  operate to enable b to be fixed. These methods are set forth and\r\n  exemplified in _Graphics_, by R. H. Smith (London, 1889). Examples,\r\n  completely worked out, of velocity and acceleration diagrams for the\r\n  slider crank chain, the four-bar chain, and the mechanism of the Joy\r\n  valve gear will be found in ch. ix. of _Valves and Valve Gear\r\n  Mechanism_, by W. E. Dalby (London, 1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II. ON APPLIED DYNAMICS.\r\n\r\n  § 83. _Laws of Motion._--The action of a machine in transmitting\r\n  _force_ and _motion_ simultaneously, or performing _work_, is\r\n  governed, in common with the phenomena of moving bodies in general, by\r\n  two \"laws of motion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Division 1. Balanced Forces in Machines of Uniform Velocity._\r\n\r\n  § 84. _Application of Force to Mechanism._--Forces are applied in\r\n  units of weight; and the unit most commonly employed in Britain is the\r\n  _pound avoirdupois_. The action of a force applied to a body is always\r\n  in reality distributed over some definite space, either a volume of\r\n  three dimensions or a surface of two. An example of a force\r\n  distributed throughout a volume is the _weight_ of the body itself,\r\n  which acts on every particle, however small. The _pressure_ exerted\r\n  between two bodies at their surface of contact, or between the two\r\n  parts of one body on either side of an ideal surface of separation, is\r\n  an example of a force distributed over a surface. The mode of\r\n  distribution of a force applied to a solid body requires to be\r\n  considered when its stiffness and strength are treated of; but, in\r\n  questions respecting the action of a force upon a rigid body\r\n  considered as a whole, the _resultant_ of the distributed force,\r\n  determined according to the principles of statics, and considered as\r\n  acting in a _single line_ and applied at a _single point_, may, for\r\n  the occasion, be substituted for the force as really distributed.\r\n  Thus, the weight of each separate piece in a machine is treated as\r\n  acting wholly at its _centre of gravity_, and each pressure applied to\r\n  it as acting at a point called the _centre of pressure_ of the surface\r\n  to which the pressure is really applied.\r\n\r\n  § 85. _Forces applied to Mechanism Classed._--If [theta] be the\r\n  _obliquity_ of a force F applied to a piece of a machine--that is, the\r\n  angle made by the direction of the force with the direction of motion\r\n  of its point of application--then by the principles of statics, F may\r\n  be resolved into two rectangular components, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    Along the direction of motion, P = F cos [theta]   \\  (49)\r\n    Across the direction of motion, Q = F sin [theta]  /\r\n\r\n  If the component along the direction of motion acts with the motion,\r\n  it is called an _effort_; if _against_ the motion, a _resistance_. The\r\n  component _across_ the direction of motion is a _lateral pressure_;\r\n  the unbalanced lateral pressure on any piece, or part of a piece, is\r\n  _deflecting force_. A lateral pressure may increase resistance by\r\n  causing friction; the friction so caused acts against the motion, and\r\n  is a resistance, but the lateral pressure causing it is not a\r\n  resistance. Resistances are distinguished into _useful_ and\r\n  _prejudicial_, according as they arise from the useful effect produced\r\n  by the machine or from other causes.\r\n\r\n  § 86. _Work._--_Work_ consists in moving against resistance. The work\r\n  is said to be _performed_, and the resistance _overcome_. Work is\r\n  measured by the product of the resistance into the distance through\r\n  which its point of application is moved. The _unit of work_ commonly\r\n  used in Britain is a resistance of one pound overcome through a\r\n  distance of one foot, and is called a _foot-pound_.\r\n\r\n  Work is distinguished into _useful work_ and _prejudicial_ or _lost\r\n  work_, according as it is performed in producing the useful effect of\r\n  the machine, or in overcoming prejudicial resistance.\r\n\r\n  § 87. _Energy: Potential Energy._--_Energy_ means _capacity for\r\n  performing work_. The _energy of an effort_, or _potential energy_, is\r\n  measured by the product of the effort into the distance through which\r\n  its point of application is _capable_ of being moved. The unit of\r\n  energy is the same with the unit of work.\r\n\r\n  When the point of application of an effort _has been moved_ through a\r\n  given distance, energy is said to have been _exerted_ to an amount\r\n  expressed by the product of the effort into the distance through which\r\n  its point of application has been moved.\r\n\r\n  § 88. _Variable Effort and Resistance._--If an effort has different\r\n  magnitudes during different portions of the motion of its point of\r\n  application through a given distance, let each different magnitude of\r\n  the effort P be multiplied by the length [Delta]s of the corresponding\r\n  portion of the path of the point of application; the sum\r\n\r\n    [Sigma] · P[Delta]s  (50)\r\n\r\n  is the whole energy exerted. If the effort varies by insensible\r\n  gradations, the energy exerted is the integral or limit towards which\r\n  that sum approaches continually as the divisions of the path are made\r\n  smaller and more numerous, and is expressed by\r\n\r\n    [int]P ds.  (51)\r\n\r\n  Similar processes are applicable to the finding of the work performed\r\n  in overcoming a varying resistance.\r\n\r\n  The work done by a machine can be actually measured by means of a\r\n  dynamometer (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  § 89. _Principle of the Equality of Energy and Work._--From the first\r\n  law of motion it follows that in a machine whose pieces move with\r\n  uniform velocities the efforts and resistances must balance each\r\n  other. Now from the laws of statics it is known that, in order that a\r\n  system of forces applied to a system of connected points may be in\r\n  equilibrium, it is necessary that the sum formed by putting together\r\n  the products of the forces by the respective distances through which\r\n  their points of application are capable of moving simultaneously, each\r\n  along the direction of the force applied to it, shall be\r\n  zero,--products being considered positive or negative according as the\r\n  direction of the forces and the possible motions of their points of\r\n  application are the same or opposite.\r\n\r\n  In other words, the sum of the negative products is equal to the sum\r\n  of the positive products. This principle, applied to a machine whose\r\n  parts move with uniform velocities, is equivalent to saying that in\r\n  any given interval of time _the energy exerted is equal to the work\r\n  performed_.\r\n\r\n  The symbolical expression of this law is as follows: let efforts be\r\n  applied to one or any number of points of a machine; let any one of\r\n  these efforts be represented by P, and the distance traversed by its\r\n  point of application in a given interval of time by ds; let\r\n  resistances be overcome at one or any number of points of the same\r\n  machine; let any one of these resistances be denoted by R, and the\r\n  distance traversed by its point of application in the given interval\r\n  of time by ds´; then\r\n\r\n    [Sigma] · P ds = [Sigma] · R ds´.  (52)\r\n\r\n  The lengths ds, ds´ are proportional to the velocities of the points\r\n  to whose paths they belong, and the proportions of those velocities to\r\n  each other are deducible from the construction of the machine by the\r\n  principles of pure mechanism explained in Chapter I.\r\n\r\n  § 90. _Static Equilibrium of Mechanisms._--The principle stated in the\r\n  preceding section, namely, that the energy exerted is equal to the\r\n  work performed, enables the ratio of the components of the forces\r\n  acting in the respective directions of motion at two points of a\r\n  mechanism, one being the point of application of the effort, and the\r\n  other the point of application of the resistance, to be readily found.\r\n  Removing the summation signs in equation (52) in order to restrict its\r\n  application to two points and dividing by the common time interval\r\n  during which the respective small displacements ds and ds´ were made,\r\n  it becomes P ds/dt = R ds´/dt, that is, Pv = Rv´, which shows that the\r\n  force ratio is the inverse of the velocity ratio. It follows at once\r\n  that any method which may be available for the determination of the\r\n  velocity ratio is equally available for the determination of the force\r\n  ratio, it being clearly understood that the forces involved are the\r\n  components of the actual forces resolved in the direction of motion\r\n  of the points. The relation between the effort and the resistance may\r\n  be found by means of this principle for all kinds of mechanisms, when\r\n  the friction produced by the components of the forces across the\r\n  direction of motion of the two points is neglected. Consider the\r\n  following example:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 126.]\r\n\r\n  A four-bar chain having the configuration shown in fig. 126 supports a\r\n  load P at the point x. What load is required at the point y to\r\n  maintain the configuration shown, both loads being supposed to act\r\n  vertically? Find the instantaneous centre O_(bd), and resolve each\r\n  load in the respective directions of motion of the points x and y;\r\n  thus there are obtained the components P cos [theta] and R cos [phi].\r\n  Let the mechanism have a small motion; then, for the instant, the link\r\n  b is turning about its instantaneous centre O_(bd), and, if [omega] is\r\n  its instantaneous angular velocity, the velocity of the point x is\r\n  [omega]r, and the velocity of the point y is [omega]s. Hence, by the\r\n  principle just stated, P cos [theta] × [omega]r = R cos [phi] ×\r\n  [omega]s. But, p and q being respectively the perpendiculars to the\r\n  lines of action of the forces, this equation reduces to P_p = R_q,\r\n  which shows that the ratio of the two forces may be found by taking\r\n  moments about the instantaneous centre of the link on which they act.\r\n\r\n  The forces P and R may, however, act on different links. The general\r\n  problem may then be thus stated: Given a mechanism of which r is the\r\n  fixed link, and s and t any other two links, given also a force f_s,\r\n  acting on the link s, to find the force f_t acting in a given\r\n  direction on the link t, which will keep the mechanism in static\r\n  equilibrium. The graphic solution of this problem may be effected\r\n  thus:--\r\n\r\n    (1) Find the three virtual centres O_(rs), O_(rt), O_(st), which\r\n    must be three points in a line.\r\n\r\n    (2) Resolve f_s into two components, one of which, namely, f_q,\r\n    passes through O_(rs) and may be neglected, and the other f_p passes\r\n    through O_(st).\r\n\r\n    (3) Find the point M, where f_p joins the given direction of f_t,\r\n    and resolve f_p into two components, of which one is in the\r\n    direction MO_(rt), and may be neglected because it passes through\r\n    O_(rt), and the other is in the given direction of f_t and is\r\n    therefore the force required.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 127.]\r\n\r\n  This statement of the problem and the solution is due to Sir A. B. W.\r\n  Kennedy, and is given in ch. 8 of his _Mechanics of Machinery_.\r\n  Another general solution of the problem is given in the _Proc. Lond.\r\n  Math. Soc._ (1878-1879), by the same author. An example of the method\r\n  of solution stated above, and taken from the _Mechanics of Machinery_,\r\n  is illustrated by the mechanism fig. 127, which is an epicyclic train\r\n  of three wheels with the first wheel r fixed. Let it be required to\r\n  find the vertical force which must act at the pitch radius of the last\r\n  wheel t to balance exactly a force f_s acting vertically downwards on\r\n  the arm at the point indicated in the figure. The two links concerned\r\n  are the last wheel t and the arm s, the wheel r being the fixed link\r\n  of the mechanism. The virtual centres O_(rs), O_(st) are at the\r\n  respective axes of the wheels r and t, and the centre O_(rt) divides\r\n  the line through these two points externally in the ratio of the train\r\n  of wheels. The figure sufficiently indicates the various steps of the\r\n  solution.\r\n\r\n  The relation between the effort and the resistance in a machine to\r\n  include the effect of friction at the joints has been investigated in\r\n  a paper by Professor Fleeming Jenkin, \"On the application of graphic\r\n  methods to the determination of the efficiency of machinery\" (_Trans.\r\n  Roy. Soc. Ed._, vol. 28). It is shown that a machine may at any\r\n  instant be represented by a frame of links the stresses in which are\r\n  identical with the pressures at the joints of the mechanism. This\r\n  self-strained frame is called the _dynamic frame_ of the machine. The\r\n  driving and resisting efforts are represented by elastic links in the\r\n  dynamic frame, and when the frame with its elastic links is drawn the\r\n  stresses in the several members of it may be determined by means of\r\n  reciprocal figures. Incidentally the method gives the pressures at\r\n  every joint of the mechanism.\r\n\r\n  § 91. _Efficiency._--The _efficiency_ of a machine is the ratio of the\r\n  _useful_ work to the _total_ work--that is, to the energy exerted--and\r\n  is represented by\r\n\r\n    [Sigma]·R_u ds´             [Sigma]·R_u ds´           [Sigma]·R_u ds´    U\r\n    --------------- = --------------------------------- = --------------- = ---.  (53)\r\n    [Sigma]·R ds´     [Sigma]·R_u ds´ + [Sigma]·R_p ds´    [Sigma]·P ds      E\r\n\r\n  R_u being taken to represent useful and R_p prejudicial resistances.\r\n  The more nearly the efficiency of a machine approaches to unity the\r\n  better is the machine.\r\n\r\n  § 92. _Power and Effect._--The _power_ of a machine is the energy\r\n  exerted, and the _effect_ the useful work performed, in some interval\r\n  of time of definite length, such as a second, an hour, or a day.\r\n\r\n  The unit of power, called conventionally a horse-power, is 550\r\n  foot-pounds per second, or 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, or 1,980,000\r\n  foot-pounds per hour.\r\n\r\n  § 93. _Modulus of a Machine._--In the investigation of the properties\r\n  of a machine, the useful resistances to be overcome and the useful\r\n  work to be performed are usually given. The prejudicial resistances\r\n  arc generally functions of the useful resistances of the weights of\r\n  the pieces of the mechanism, and of their form and arrangement; and,\r\n  having been determined, they serve for the computation of the _lost_\r\n  work, which, being added to the useful work, gives the expenditure of\r\n  energy required. The result of this investigation, expressed in the\r\n  form of an equation between this energy and the useful work, is called\r\n  by Moseley the _modulus_ of the machine. The general form of the\r\n  modulus may be expressed thus--\r\n\r\n    E = U + [phi](U, A) + [psi](A),  (54)\r\n\r\n  where A denotes some quantity or set of quantities depending on the\r\n  form, arrangement, weight and other properties of the mechanism.\r\n  Moseley, however, has pointed out that in most cases this equation\r\n  takes the much more simple form of\r\n\r\n    E = (1 + A)U + B,  (55)\r\n\r\n  where A and B are _constants_, depending on the form, arrangement and\r\n  weight of the mechanism. The efficiency corresponding to the last\r\n  equation is\r\n\r\n     U        1\r\n    --- = -----------.  (56)\r\n     E    1 + A + B/U\r\n\r\n  § 94. _Trains of Mechanism._--In applying the preceding principles to\r\n  a train of mechanism, it may either be treated as a whole, or it may\r\n  be considered in sections consisting of single pieces, or of any\r\n  convenient portion of the train--each section being treated as a\r\n  machine, driven by the effort applied to it and energy exerted upon it\r\n  through its line of connexion with the preceding section, performing\r\n  useful work by driving the following section, and losing work by\r\n  overcoming its own prejudicial resistances. It is evident that _the\r\n  efficiency of the whole train is the product of the efficiencies of\r\n  its sections_.\r\n\r\n  § 95. _Rotating Pieces: Couples of Forces._--It is often convenient to\r\n  express the energy exerted upon and the work performed by a turning\r\n  piece in a machine in terms of the _moment_ of the _couples of forces_\r\n  acting on it, and of the angular velocity. The ordinary British unit\r\n  of moment is a _foot-pound_; but it is to be remembered that this is a\r\n  foot-pound of a different sort from the unit of energy and work.\r\n\r\n  If a force be applied to a turning piece in a line not passing through\r\n  its axis, the axis will press against its bearings with an equal and\r\n  parallel force, and the equal and opposite reaction of the bearings\r\n  will constitute, together with the first-mentioned force, a couple\r\n  whose arm is the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of\r\n  action of the first force.\r\n\r\n  A couple is said to be _right_ or _left handed_ with reference to the\r\n  observer, according to the direction in which it tends to turn the\r\n  body, and is a _driving_ couple or a _resisting_ couple according as\r\n  its tendency is with or against that of the actual rotation.\r\n\r\n  Let dt be an interval of time, [alpha] the angular velocity of the\r\n  piece; then [alpha]dt is the angle through which it turns in the\r\n  interval dt, and ds = vdt = r[alpha]dt is the distance through which\r\n  the point of application of the force moves. Let P represent an\r\n  effort, so that Pr is a driving couple, then\r\n\r\n    P ds = Pv dt = Pr[alpha] dt = M[alpha] dt  (57)\r\n\r\n  is the energy exerted by the couple M in the interval dt; and a\r\n  similar equation gives the work performed in overcoming a resisting\r\n  couple. When several couples act on one piece, the resultant of their\r\n  moments is to be multiplied by the common angular velocity of the\r\n  whole piece.\r\n\r\n  § 96. _Reduction of Forces to a given Point, and of Couples to the\r\n  Axis of a given Piece._--In computations respecting machines it is\r\n  often convenient to substitute for a force applied to a given point,\r\n  or a couple applied to a given piece, the _equivalent_ force or couple\r\n  applied to some other point or piece; that is to say, the force or\r\n  couple, which, if applied to the other point or piece, would exert\r\n  equal energy or employ equal work. The principles of this reduction\r\n  are that the ratio of the given to the equivalent force is the\r\n  reciprocal of the ratio of the velocities of their points of\r\n  application, and the ratio of the given to the equivalent couple is\r\n  the reciprocal of the ratio of the angular velocities of the pieces to\r\n  which they are applied.\r\n\r\n  These velocity ratios are known by the construction of the mechanism,\r\n  and are independent of the absolute speed.\r\n\r\n  § 97. _Balanced Lateral Pressure of Guides and Bearings._--The most\r\n  important part of the lateral pressure on a piece of mechanism is the\r\n  reaction of its guides, if it is a sliding piece, or of the bearings\r\n  of its axis, if it is a turning piece; and the balanced portion of\r\n  this reaction is equal and opposite to the resultant of all the other\r\n  forces applied to the piece, its own weight included. There may be or\r\n  may not be an unbalanced component in this pressure, due to the\r\n  deviated motion. Its laws will be considered in the sequel.\r\n\r\n  § 98. _Friction. Unguents._--The most important kind of resistance in\r\n  machines is the _friction_ or _rubbing resistance_ of surfaces which\r\n  slide over each other. The _direction_ of the resistance of friction\r\n  is opposite to that in which the sliding takes place. Its _magnitude_\r\n  is the product of the _normal pressure_ or force which presses the\r\n  rubbing surfaces together in a direction perpendicular to themselves\r\n  into a specific constant already mentioned in § 14, as the\r\n  _coefficient of friction_, which depends on the nature and condition\r\n  of the surfaces of the unguent, if any, with which they are covered.\r\n  The _total pressure_ exerted between the rubbing surfaces is the\r\n  resultant of the normal pressure and of the friction, and its\r\n  _obliquity_, or inclination to the common perpendicular of the\r\n  surfaces, is the _angle of repose_ formerly mentioned in § 14, whose\r\n  tangent is the coefficient of friction. Thus, let N be the normal\r\n  pressure, R the friction, T the total pressure, f the coefficient of\r\n  friction, and [phi] the angle of repose; then\r\n\r\n    f = tan [phi]                      \\  (58)\r\n    R = fN = N tan [phi] = T sin [phi] /\r\n\r\n  Experiments on friction have been made by Coulomb, Samuel Vince, John\r\n  Rennie, James Wood, D. Rankine and others. The most complete and\r\n  elaborate experiments are those of Morin, published in his _Notions\r\n  fondamentales de mécanique_, and republished in Britain in the works\r\n  of Moseley and Gordon.\r\n\r\n  The experiments of Beauchamp Tower (\"Report of Friction Experiments,\"\r\n  _Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng._, 1883) showed that when oil is supplied to a\r\n  journal by means of an oil bath the coefficient of friction varies\r\n  nearly inversely as the load on the bearing, thus making the product\r\n  of the load on the bearing and the coefficient of friction a constant.\r\n  Mr Tower's experiments were carried out at nearly constant\r\n  temperature. The more recent experiments of Lasche (_Zeitsch, Verein\r\n  Deutsche Ingen._, 1902, 46, 1881) show that the product of the\r\n  coefficient of friction, the load on the bearing, and the temperature\r\n  is approximately constant. For further information on this point and\r\n  on Osborne Reynolds's theory of lubrication see BEARINGS and\r\n  LUBRICATION.\r\n\r\n  § 99. _Work of Friction. Moment of Friction._--The work performed in a\r\n  unit of time in overcoming the friction of a pair of surfaces is the\r\n  product of the friction by the velocity of sliding of the surfaces\r\n  over each other, if that is the same throughout the whole extent of\r\n  the rubbing surfaces. If that velocity is different for different\r\n  portions of the rubbing surfaces, the velocity of each portion is to\r\n  be multiplied by the friction of that portion, and the results summed\r\n  or integrated.\r\n\r\n  When the relative motion of the rubbing surfaces is one of rotation,\r\n  the work of friction in a unit of time, for a portion of the rubbing\r\n  surfaces at a given distance from the axis of rotation, may be found\r\n  by multiplying together the friction of that portion, its distance\r\n  from the axis, and the angular velocity. The product of the force of\r\n  friction by the distance at which it acts from the axis of rotation is\r\n  called the _moment of friction_. The total moment of friction of a\r\n  pair of rotating rubbing surfaces is the sum or integral of the\r\n  moments of friction of their several portions.\r\n\r\n  To express this symbolically, let du represent the area of a portion\r\n  of a pair of rubbing surfaces at a distance r from the axis of their\r\n  relative rotation; p the intensity of the normal pressure at du per\r\n  unit of area; and f the coefficient of friction. Then the moment of\r\n  friction of du is fprdu;\r\n\r\n    the total moment of friction is f [integral] pr·du;              \\\r\n    and the work performed in a unit cf time in overcoming friction,  >  (59)\r\n    when the angular velocity is [alpha], is [alpha]f [int] pr·du.   /\r\n\r\n  It is evident that the moment of friction, and the work lost by being\r\n  performed in overcoming friction, are less in a rotating piece as the\r\n  bearings are of smaller radius. But a limit is put to the diminution\r\n  of the radii of journals and pivots by the conditions of durability\r\n  and of proper lubrication, and also by conditions of strength and\r\n  stiffness.\r\n\r\n  § 100. _Total Pressure between Journal and Bearing._--A single piece\r\n  rotating with a uniform velocity has four mutually balanced forces\r\n  applied to it: (l) the effort exerted on it by the piece which drives\r\n  it; (2) the resistance of the piece which follows it--which may be\r\n  considered for the purposes of the present question as useful\r\n  resistance; (3) its weight; and (4) the reaction of its own\r\n  cylindrical bearings. There are given the following data:--\r\n\r\n    The direction of the effort.\r\n    The direction of the useful resistance.\r\n    The weight of the piece and the direction in which it acts.\r\n    The magnitude of the useful resistance.\r\n    The radius of the bearing r.\r\n    The angle of repose [phi], corresponding to the friction of the\r\n      journal on the bearing.\r\n\r\n  And there are required the following:--\r\n\r\n    The direction of the reaction of the bearing.\r\n    The magnitude of that reaction.\r\n    The magnitude of the effort.\r\n\r\n  Let the useful resistance and the weight of the piece be compounded by\r\n  the principles of statics into one force, and let this be called _the\r\n  given force_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 128.]\r\n\r\n  The directions of the effort and of the given force are either\r\n  parallel or meet in a point. If they are parallel, the direction of\r\n  the reaction of the bearing is also parallel to them; if they meet in\r\n  a point, the direction of the reaction traverses the same point.\r\n\r\n  Also, let AAA, fig. 128, be a section of the bearing, and C its axis;\r\n  then the direction of the reaction, at the point where it intersects\r\n  the circle AAA, must make the angle [phi] with the radius of that\r\n  circle; that is to say, it must be a line such as PT touching the\r\n  smaller circle BB, whose radius is r · sin [phi]. The side on which it\r\n  touches that circle is determined by the fact that the obliquity of\r\n  the reaction is such as to oppose the rotation.\r\n\r\n  Thus is determined the direction of the reaction of the bearing; and\r\n  the magnitude of that reaction and of the effort are then found by the\r\n  principles of the equilibrium of three forces already stated in § 7.\r\n\r\n  The work lost in overcoming the friction of the bearing is the same as\r\n  that which would be performed in overcoming at the circumference of\r\n  the small circle BB a resistance equal to the whole pressure between\r\n  the journal and bearing.\r\n\r\n  In order to diminish that pressure to the smallest possible amount,\r\n  the effort, and the resultant of the useful resistance, and the weight\r\n  of the piece (called above the \"given force\") ought to be opposed to\r\n  each other as directly as is practicable consistently with the\r\n  purposes of the machine.\r\n\r\n  An investigation of the forces acting on a bearing and journal\r\n  lubricated by an oil bath will be found in a paper by Osborne Reynolds\r\n  in the _Phil. Trans._ pt. i. (1886). (See also BEARINGS.)\r\n\r\n  § 101. _Friction of Pivots and Collars._--When a shaft is acted upon\r\n  by a force tending to shift it lengthways, that force must be balanced\r\n  by the reaction of a bearing against a _pivot_ at the end of the\r\n  shaft; or, if that be impossible, against one or more _collars_, or\r\n  rings _projecting_ from the body of the shaft. The bearing of the\r\n  pivot is called a _step_ or _footstep_. Pivots require great hardness,\r\n  and are usually made of steel. The _flat_ pivot is a cylinder of steel\r\n  having a plane circular end as a rubbing surface. Let N be the total\r\n  pressure sustained by a flat pivot of the radius r; if that pressure\r\n  be uniformly distributed, which is the case when the rubbing surfaces\r\n  of the pivot and its step are both true planes, the _intensity_ of the\r\n  pressure is\r\n\r\n    p = N/[pi]r²;  (60)\r\n\r\n  and, introducing this value into equation 59, the _moment of friction\r\n  of the flat pivot_ is found to be\r\n\r\n    (2/3)fNr  (61)\r\n\r\n  or two-thirds of that of a cylindrical journal of the same radius\r\n  under the same normal pressure.\r\n\r\n  The friction of a _conical_ pivot exceeds that of a flat pivot of the\r\n  same radius, and under the same pressure, in the proportion of the\r\n  side of the cone to the radius of its base.\r\n\r\n  The moment of friction of a _collar_ is given by the formula--\r\n\r\n            r³ - r´³\r\n    (2/3)fN --------,  (62)\r\n            r² - r´²\r\n\r\n  where r is the external and r´ the internal radius.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 129.]\r\n\r\n  In the _cup and ball_ pivot the end of the shaft and the step present\r\n  two recesses facing each other, into which art fitted two shallow cups\r\n  of steel or hard bronze. Between the concave spherical surfaces of\r\n  those cups is placed a steel ball, being either a complete sphere or a\r\n  lens having convex surfaces of a somewhat less radius than the concave\r\n  surfaces of the cups. The moment of friction of this pivot is at first\r\n  almost inappreciable from the extreme smallness of the radius of the\r\n  circles of contact of the ball and cups, but, as they wear, that\r\n  radius and the moment of friction increase.\r\n\r\n  It appears that the rapidity with which a rubbing surface wears away\r\n  is proportional to the friction and to the velocity jointly, or nearly\r\n  so. Hence the pivots already mentioned wear unequally at different\r\n  points, and tend to alter their figures. Schiele has invented a pivot\r\n  which preserves its original figure by wearing equally at all points\r\n  in a direction parallel to its axis. The following are the principles\r\n  on which this equality of wear depends:--\r\n\r\n  The rapidity of wear of a surface measured in an _oblique_ direction\r\n  is to the rapidity of wear measured normally as the secant of the\r\n  obliquity is to unity. Let OX (fig. 129) be the axis of a pivot, and\r\n  let RPC be a portion of a curve such that at any point P the secant of\r\n  the obliquity to the normal of the curve of a line parallel to the\r\n  axis is inversely proportional to the ordinate PY, to which the\r\n  velocity of P is proportional. The rotation of that curve round OX\r\n  will generate the form of pivot required. Now let PT be a tangent to\r\n  the curve at P, cutting OX in T; PT = PY × _secant obliquity_, and\r\n  this is to be a constant quantity; hence the curve is that known as\r\n  the _tractory_ of the straight line OX, in which PT = OR = constant.\r\n  This curve is described by having a fixed straight edge parallel to\r\n  OX, along which slides a slider carrying a pin whose centre is T. On\r\n  that pin turns an arm, carrying at a point P a tracing-point, pencil\r\n  or pen. Should the pen have a nib of two jaws, like those of an\r\n  ordinary drawing-pen, the plane of the jaws must pass through PT.\r\n  Then, while T is slid along the axis from O towards X, P will be drawn\r\n  after it from R towards C along the tractory. This curve, being an\r\n  asymptote to its axis, is capable of being indefinitely prolonged\r\n  towards X; but in designing pivots it should stop before the angle PTY\r\n  becomes less than the angle of repose of the rubbing surfaces,\r\n  otherwise the pivot will be liable to stick in its bearing. The moment\r\n  of friction of \"Schiele's anti-friction pivot,\" as it is called, is\r\n  equal to that of a cylindrical journal of the radius OR = PT the\r\n  constant tangent, under the same pressure.\r\n\r\n  Records of experiments on the friction of a pivot bearing will be\r\n  found in the _Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng._ (1891), and on the friction of a\r\n  collar bearing ib. May 1888.\r\n\r\n  § 102. _Friction of Teeth._--Let N be the normal pressure exerted\r\n  between a pair of teeth of a pair of wheels; s the total distance\r\n  through which they slide upon each other; n the number of pairs of\r\n  teeth which pass the plane of axis in a unit of time; then\r\n\r\n    nfNs  (63)\r\n\r\n  is the work lost in unity of time by the friction of the teeth. The\r\n  sliding s is composed of two parts, which take place during the\r\n  approach and recess respectively. Let those be denoted by s1 and s2,\r\n  so that s = s1 + s2. In § 45 the _velocity_ of sliding at any instant\r\n  has been given, viz. u = c ([alpha]1 + [alpha]2), where u is that\r\n  velocity, c the distance T1 at any instant from the point of contact\r\n  of the teeth to the pitch-point, and [alpha]1, [alpha]2 the respective\r\n  angular velocities of the wheels.\r\n\r\n  Let v be the common velocity of the two pitch-circles, r1, r2, their\r\n  radii; then the above equation becomes\r\n\r\n            / 1     1 \\\r\n    u = cv ( --- + --- ).\r\n            \\r1    r2 /\r\n\r\n  To apply this to involute teeth, let c1 be the length of the approach,\r\n  c2 that of the recess, u1, the _mean_ volocity of sliding during the\r\n  approach, u2 that during the recess; then\r\n\r\n         c1v  / 1     1 \\        c2v  / 1     1 \\\r\n    u1 = --- ( --- + --- ); u2 = --- ( --- + --- )\r\n          2   \\r1    r2 /         2   \\r1    r2 /\r\n\r\n  also, let [theta] be the obliquity of the action; then the times\r\n  occupied by the approach and recess are respectively\r\n\r\n         c1              c2\r\n    -------------,  -------------;\r\n    v cos [theta]   v cos [theta]\r\n\r\n  giving, finally, for the length of sliding between each pair of teeth,\r\n\r\n                    c1² + c2²    / 1     1 \\\r\n    s = s1 + s2 = ------------- ( --- + --- )  (64)\r\n                  2 cos [theta]  \\r1    r2 /\r\n\r\n  which, substituted in equation (63), gives the work lost in a unit of\r\n  time by the friction of involute teeth. This result, which is exact\r\n  for involute teeth, is approximately true for teeth of any figure.\r\n\r\n  For inside gearing, if r1 be the less radius and r2 the greater, 1/r1\r\n  - 1/r2 is to be substituted for 1/r1 + 1/r2.\r\n\r\n  § 103. _Friction of Cords and Belts._--A flexible band, such as a\r\n  cord, rope, belt or strap, may be used either to exert an effort or a\r\n  resistance upon a pulley round which it wraps. In either case the\r\n  tangential force, whether effort or resistance, exerted between the\r\n  band and the pulley is their mutual friction, caused by and\r\n  proportional to the normal pressure between them.\r\n\r\n  Let T1 be the tension of the free part of the band at that side\r\n  _towards_ which it tends to draw the pulley, or _from_ which the\r\n  pulley tends to draw it; T2 the tension of the free part at the other\r\n  side; T the tension of the band at any intermediate point of its arc\r\n  of contact with the pulley; [theta] the ratio of the length of that\r\n  arc to the radius of the pulley; d[theta] the ratio of an indefinitely\r\n  small element of that arc to the radius; F = T1 - T2 the total\r\n  friction between the band and the pulley; dF the elementary portion of\r\n  that friction due to the elementary arc d[theta]; f the coefficient of\r\n  friction between the materials of the band and pulley.\r\n\r\n  Then, according to a well-known principle in statics, the normal\r\n  pressure at the elementary arc d[theta] is Td[theta], T being the mean\r\n  tension of the band at that elementary arc; consequently the friction\r\n  on that arc is dF = fTd[theta]. Now that friction is also the\r\n  difference between the tensions of the band at the two ends of the\r\n  elementary arc, or dT = dF = fTd[theta]; which equation, being\r\n  integrated throughout the entire arc of contact, gives the following\r\n  formulae:--\r\n\r\n             T1                                              \\\r\n    hyp log. -- = f^[theta]                                  |\r\n             T2                                              |\r\n                                                             |\r\n    T1                                                        >  (65)\r\n    -- = ef^[theta]                                          |\r\n    T2                                                       |\r\n                                                             |\r\n    F = T1 - T2 = T1(1 - e - f^[theta]) = T2(ef^[theta] - 1) /\r\n\r\n  When a belt connecting a pair of pulleys has the tensions of its two\r\n  sides originally equal, the pulleys being at rest, and when the\r\n  pulleys are next set in motion, so that one of them drives the other\r\n  by means of the belt, it is found that the advancing side of the belt\r\n  is exactly as much tightened as the returning side is slackened, so\r\n  that the _mean_ tension remains unchanged. Its value is given by this\r\n  formula--\r\n\r\n    T1 + T2    ef^[theta] + 1\r\n    ------- = -----------------  (66)\r\n       2      2(ef^[theta] - 1)\r\n\r\n  which is useful in determining the original tension required to enable\r\n  a belt to transmit a given force between two pulleys.\r\n\r\n  The equations 65 and 66 are applicable to a kind of _brake_ called a\r\n  _friction-strap_, used to stop or moderate the velocity of machines by\r\n  being tightened round a pulley.

It increases with the sectional area\r\n  of the rope, and is inversely proportional to the radius of the curve\r\n  into which it is bent.\r\n\r\n  The _work lost_ in pulling a given length of rope over a pulley is\r\n  found by multiplying the length of the rope in feet by its stiffness\r\n  in pounds, that stiffness being the excess of the tension at the\r\n  leading side of the rope above that at the following side, which is\r\n  necessary to bend it into a curve fitting the pulley, and then to\r\n  straighten it again.\r\n\r\n  The following empirical formulae for the stiffness of hempen ropes\r\n  have been deduced by Morin from the experiments of Coulomb:--\r\n\r\n  Let F be the stiffness in pounds avoirdupois; d the diameter of the\r\n  rope in inches, n = 48d² for white ropes and 35d² for tarred ropes; r\r\n  the _effective_ radius of the pulley in inches; T the tension in\r\n  pounds. Then\r\n\r\n                          n                                  \\\r\n    For white ropes, F = --- (0.0012 + 0.001026n + 0.0012T)  |\r\n                          r                                  |\r\n                                                              >  (68)\r\n                           n                                 |\r\n    For tarred ropes, F = --- (0.006 + 0.001392n + 0.00168T) |\r\n                           r                                 /\r\n\r\n  § 105. _Friction-Couplings._--Friction is useful as a means of\r\n  communicating motion where sudden changes either of force or velocity\r\n  take place, because, being limited in amount, it may be so adjusted as\r\n  to limit the forces which strain the pieces of the mechanism within\r\n  the bounds of safety. Amongst contrivances for effecting this object\r\n  are _friction-cones_. A rotating shaft carries upon a cylindrical\r\n  portion of its figure a wheel or pulley turning loosely on it, and\r\n  consequently capable of remaining at rest when the shaft is in motion.\r\n  This pulley has fixed to one side, and concentric with it, a short\r\n  frustum of a hollow cone. At a small distance from the pulley the\r\n  shaft carries a short frustum of a solid cone accurately turned to fit\r\n  the hollow cone. This frustum is made always to turn along with the\r\n  shaft by being fitted on a square portion of it, or by means of a rib\r\n  and groove, or otherwise, but is capable of a slight longitudinal\r\n  motion, so as to be pressed into, or withdrawn from, the hollow cone\r\n  by means of a lever. When the cones are pressed together or engaged,\r\n  their friction causes the pulley to rotate along with the shaft; when\r\n  they are disengaged, the pulley is free to stand still. The angle made\r\n  by the sides of the cones with the axis should not be less than the\r\n  angle of repose. In the _friction-clutch_, a pulley loose on a shaft\r\n  has a hoop or gland made to embrace it more or less tightly by means\r\n  of a screw; this hoop has short projecting arms or ears. A fork or\r\n  _clutch_ rotates along with the shaft, and is capable of being moved\r\n  longitudinally by a handle. When the clutch is moved towards the hoop,\r\n  its arms catch those of the hoop, and cause the hoop to rotate and to\r\n  communicate its rotation to the pulley by friction. There are many\r\n  other contrivances of the same class, but the two just mentioned may\r\n  serve for examples.\r\n\r\n  § 106. _Heat of Friction: Unguents._--The work lost in friction is\r\n  employed in producing heat. This fact is very obvious, and has been\r\n  known from a remote period; but the _exact_ determination of the\r\n  proportion of the work lost to the heat produced, and the experimental\r\n  proof that that proportion is the same under all circumstances and\r\n  with all materials, solid, liquid and gaseous, are comparatively\r\n  recent achievements of J. P. Joule. The quantity of work which\r\n  produces a British unit of heat (or so much heat as elevates the\r\n  temperature of one pound of pure water, at or near ordinary\r\n  atmospheric temperatures, by 1° F.) is 772 foot-pounds. This constant,\r\n  now designated as \"Joule's equivalent,\" is the principal experimental\r\n  datum of the science of thermodynamics.\r\n\r\n  A more recent determination (_Phil. Trans._, 1897), by Osborne\r\n  Reynolds and W. M. Moorby, gives 778 as the mean value of Joule's\r\n  equivalent through the range of 32° to 212° F. See also the papers of\r\n  Rowland in the _Proc. Amer. Acad._ (1879), and Griffiths, _Phil.\r\n  Trans._ (1893).\r\n\r\n  The heat produced by friction, when moderate in amount, is useful in\r\n  softening and liquefying thick unguents; but when excessive it is\r\n  prejudicial, by decomposing the unguents, and sometimes even by\r\n  softening the metal of the bearings, and raising their temperature so\r\n  high as to set fire to neighbouring combustible matters.\r\n\r\n  Excessive heating is prevented by a constant and copious supply of a\r\n  good unguent. The elevation of temperature produced by the friction of\r\n  a journal is sometimes used as an experimental test of the quality of\r\n  unguents. For modern methods of forced lubrication see BEARINGS.\r\n\r\n  § 107. _Rolling Resistance._--By the rolling of two surfaces over each\r\n  other without sliding a resistance is caused which is called sometimes\r\n  \"rolling friction,\" but more correctly _rolling resistance_. It is of\r\n  the nature of a _couple_, resisting rotation. Its _moment_ is found by\r\n  multiplying the normal pressure between the rolling surfaces by an\r\n  _arm_, whose length depends on the nature of the rolling surfaces, and\r\n  the work lost in a unit of time in overcoming it is the product of its\r\n  moment by the _angular velocity_ of the rolling surfaces relatively to\r\n  each other. The following are approximate values of the arm in\r\n  decimals of a foot:--\r\n\r\n    Oak upon oak             0.006 (Coulomb).\r\n    Lignum vitae on oak      0.004     \"\r\n    Cast iron on cast iron   0.002 (Tredgold).\r\n\r\n  § 108. _Reciprocating Forces: Stored and Restored Energy._--When a\r\n  force acts on a machine alternately as an effort and as a resistance,\r\n  it may be called a _reciprocating force_. Of this kind is the weight\r\n  of any piece in the mechanism whose centre of gravity alternately\r\n  rises and falls; for during the rise of the centre of gravity that\r\n  weight acts as a resistance, and energy is employed in lifting it to\r\n  an amount expressed by the product of the weight into the vertical\r\n  height of its rise; and during the fall of the centre of gravity the\r\n  weight acts as an effort, and exerts in assisting to perform the work\r\n  of the machine an amount of energy exactly equal to that which had\r\n  previously been employed in lifting it. Thus that amount of energy is\r\n  not lost, but has its operation deferred; and it is said to be\r\n  _stored_ when the weight is lifted, and _restored_ when it falls.\r\n\r\n  In a machine of which each piece is to move with a uniform velocity,\r\n  if the effort and the resistance be constant, the weight of each piece\r\n  must be balanced on its axis, so that it may produce lateral pressure\r\n  only, and not act as a reciprocating force. But if the effort and the\r\n  resistance be alternately in excess, the uniformity of speed may still\r\n  be preserved by so adjusting some moving weight in the mechanism that\r\n  when the effort is in excess it may be lifted, and so balance and\r\n  employ the excess of effort, and that when the resistance is in excess\r\n  it may fall, and so balance and overcome the excess of\r\n  resistance--thus _storing_ the periodical excess of energy and\r\n  _restoring_ that energy to perform the periodical excess of work.\r\n\r\n  Other forces besides gravity may be used as reciprocating forces for\r\n  storing and restoring energy--for example, the elasticity of a spring\r\n  or of a mass of air.\r\n\r\n  In most of the delusive machines commonly called \"perpetual motions,\"\r\n  of which so many are patented in each year, and which are expected by\r\n  their inventors to perform work without receiving energy, the\r\n  fundamental fallacy consists in an expectation that some reciprocating\r\n  force shall restore more energy than it has been the means of storing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Division 2. Deflecting Forces._\r\n\r\n  § 109. _Deflecting Force for Translation in a Curved Path._--In\r\n  machinery, deflecting force is supplied by the tenacity of some piece,\r\n  such as a crank, which guides the deflected body in its curved path,\r\n  and is _unbalanced_, being employed in producing deflexion, and not in\r\n  balancing another force.\r\n\r\n  § 110. _Centrifugal Force of a Rotating Body._--_The centrifugal force\r\n  exerted by a rotating body on its axis of rotation is the same in\r\n  magnitude as if the mass of the body were concentrated at its centre\r\n  of gravity, and acts in a plane passing through the axis of rotation\r\n  and the centre of gravity of the body._\r\n\r\n  The particles of a rotating body exert centrifugal forces on each\r\n  other, which strain the body, and tend to tear it asunder, but these\r\n  forces balance each other, and do not affect the resultant centrifugal\r\n  force exerted on the axis of rotation.[3]\r\n\r\n  _If the axis of rotation traverses the centre of gravity of the body,\r\n  the centrifugal force exerted on that axis is nothing._\r\n\r\n  Hence, unless there be some reason to the contrary, each piece of a\r\n  machine should be balanced on its axis of rotation; otherwise the\r\n  centrifugal force will cause strains, vibration and increased\r\n  friction, and a tendency of the shafts to jump out of their bearings.\r\n\r\n  § 111. _Centrifugal Couples of a Rotating Body._--Besides the tendency\r\n  (if any) of the combined centrifugal forces of the particles of a\r\n  rotating body to _shift_ the axis of rotation, they may also tend to\r\n  _turn_ it out of its original direction. The latter tendency is called\r\n  _a centrifugal couple_, and vanishes for rotation about a principal\r\n  axis.\r\n\r\n  It is essential to the steady motion of every rapidly rotating piece\r\n  in a machine that its axis of rotation should not merely traverse its\r\n  centre of gravity, but should be a permanent axis; for otherwise the\r\n  centrifugal couples will increase friction, produce oscillation of the\r\n  shaft and tend to make it leave its bearings.\r\n\r\n  The principles of this and the preceding section are those which\r\n  regulate the adjustment of the weight and position of the\r\n  counterpoises which are placed between the spokes of the\r\n  driving-wheels of locomotive engines.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: (From _Balancing of Engines_, by permission of Edward\r\n  Arnold.)\r\n\r\n  FIG. 130.]\r\n\r\n  § 112.* _Method of computing the position and magnitudes of balance\r\n  weights which must be added to a given system of arbitrarily chosen\r\n  rotating masses in order to make the common axis of rotation a\r\n  permanent axis._--The method here briefly explained is taken from a\r\n  paper by W. E. Dalby, \"The Balancing of Engines with special reference\r\n  to Marine Work,\" _Trans. Inst. Nav. Arch._ (1899). Let the weight\r\n  (fig. 130), attached to a truly turned disk, be rotated by the shaft\r\n  OX, and conceive that the shaft is held in a bearing at one point, O.\r\n  The force required to constrain the weight to move in a circle, that\r\n  is the deviating force, produces an equal and opposite reaction on the\r\n  shaft, whose amount F is equal to the centrifugal force Wa²r/g lb.,\r\n  where r is the radius of the mass centre of the weight, and a is its\r\n  angular velocity in radians per second. Transferring this force to the\r\n  point O, it is equivalent to, (1) a force at O equal and parallel to\r\n  F, and, (2) a centrifugal couple of Fa foot-pounds. In order that OX\r\n  may be a permanent axis it is necessary that there should be a\r\n  sufficient number of weights attached to the shaft and so distributed\r\n  that when each is referred to the point O\r\n\r\n    (1) [Sigma]F  = 0  \\  (a)\r\n    (2) [Sigma]Fa = 0  /\r\n\r\n  The plane through O to which the shaft is perpendicular is called the\r\n  _reference plane_, because all the transferred forces act in that\r\n  plane at the point O. The plane through the radius of the weight\r\n  containing the axis OX is called the _axial plane_ because it contains\r\n  the forces forming the couple due to the transference of F to the\r\n  reference plane. Substituting the values of F in (a) the two\r\n  conditions become\r\n\r\n                                   a²\r\n    (1) (W1r1 + W2r2 + W3r3 + ...)--- = 0\r\n                                   g\r\n                                 a²         (b)\r\n    (2) (W1a1r1 + W2a2r2 + ... )--- = 0\r\n                                 g\r\n\r\n  In order that these conditions may obtain, the quantities in the\r\n  brackets must be zero, since the factor a²/g is not zero. Hence\r\n  finally the conditions which must be satisfied by the system of\r\n  weights in order that the axis of rotation may be a permanent axis is\r\n\r\n    (1) (W1r1 + W2r2 + W3r3) = 0\r\n    (2) (W1a1r1 + W2a2r2 + W3a3r3) = 0  (c)\r\n\r\n  It must be remembered that these are all directed quantities, and that\r\n  their respective sums are to be taken by drawing vector polygons. In\r\n  drawing these polygons the magnitude of the vector of the type Wr is\r\n  the product Wr, and the direction of the vector is from the shaft\r\n  outwards towards the weight W, parallel to the radius r. For the\r\n  vector representing a couple of the type War, if the masses are all on\r\n  the same side of the reference plane, the direction of drawing is from\r\n  the axis outwards; if the masses are some on one side of the reference\r\n  plane and some on the other side, the direction of drawing is from the\r\n  axis outwards towards the weight for all masses on the one side, and\r\n  from the mass inwards towards the axis for all weights on the other\r\n  side, drawing always parallel to the direction defined by the radius\r\n  r. The magnitude of the vector is the product War. The conditions (c)\r\n  may thus be expressed: first, that the sum of the vectors Wr must form\r\n  a closed polygon, and, second, that the sum of the vectors War must\r\n  form a closed polygon. The general problem in practice is, given a\r\n  system of weights attached to a shaft, to find the respective weights\r\n  and positions of two balance weights or counterpoises which must be\r\n  added to the system in order to make the shaft a permanent axis, the\r\n  planes in which the balance weights are to revolve also being given.\r\n  To solve this the reference plane must be chosen so that it coincides\r\n  with the plane of revolution of one of the as yet unknown balance\r\n  weights. The balance weight in this plane has therefore no couple\r\n  corresponding to it. Hence by drawing a couple polygon for the given\r\n  weights the vector which is required to close the polygon is at once\r\n  found and from it the magnitude and position of the balance weight\r\n  which must be added to the system to balance the couples follow at\r\n  once. Then, transferring the product Wr corresponding with this\r\n  balance weight to the reference plane, proceed to draw the force\r\n  polygon. The vector required to close it will determine the second\r\n  balance weight, the work may be checked by taking the reference plane\r\n  to coincide with the plane of revolution of the second balance weight\r\n  and then re-determining them, or by taking a reference plane anywhere\r\n  and including the two balance weights trying if condition (c) is\r\n  satisfied.\r\n\r\n  When a weight is reciprocated, the equal and opposite force required\r\n  for its acceleration at any instant appears as an unbalanced force on\r\n  the frame of the machine to which the weight belongs. In the\r\n  particular case, where the motion is of the kind known as \"simple\r\n  harmonic\" the disturbing force on the frame due to the reciprocation\r\n  of the weight is equal to the component of the centrifugal force in\r\n  the line of stroke due to a weight equal to the reciprocated weight\r\n  supposed concentrated at the crank pin. Using this principle the\r\n  method of finding the balance weights to be added to a given system of\r\n  reciprocating weights in order to produce a system of forces on the\r\n  frame continuously in equilibrium is exactly the same as that just\r\n  explained for a system of revolving weights, because for the purpose\r\n  of finding the balance weights each reciprocating weight may be\r\n  supposed attached to the crank pin which operates it, thus forming an\r\n  equivalent revolving system. The balance weights found as part of the\r\n  equivalent revolving system when reciprocated by their respective\r\n  crank pins form the balance weights for the given reciprocating\r\n  system. These conditions may be exactly realized by a system of\r\n  weights reciprocated by slotted bars, the crank shaft driving the\r\n  slotted bars rotating uniformly. In practice reciprocation is usually\r\n  effected through a connecting rod, as in the case of steam engines. In\r\n  balancing the mechanism of a steam engine it is often sufficiently\r\n  accurate to consider the motion of the pistons as simple harmonic, and\r\n  the effect on the framework of the acceleration of the connecting rod\r\n  may be approximately allowed for by distributing the weight of the rod\r\n  between the crank pin and the piston inversely as the centre of\r\n  gravity of the rod divides the distance between the centre of the\r\n  cross head pin and the centre of the crank pin. The moving parts of\r\n  the engine are then divided into two complete and independent systems,\r\n  namely, one system of revolving weights consisting of crank pins,\r\n  crank arms, &c., attached to and revolving with the crank shaft, and a\r\n  second system of reciprocating weights consisting of the pistons,\r\n  cross-heads, &c., supposed to be moving each in its line of stroke\r\n  with simple harmonic motion. The balance weights are to be separately\r\n  calculated for each system, the one set being added to the crank shaft\r\n  as revolving weights, and the second set being included with the\r\n  reciprocating weights and operated by a properly placed crank on the\r\n  crank shaft. Balance weights added in this way to a set of\r\n  reciprocating weights are sometimes called bob-weights. In the case of\r\n  locomotives the balance weights required to balance the pistons are\r\n  added as revolving weights to the crank shaft system, and in fact are\r\n  generally combined with the weights required to balance the revolving\r\n  system so as to form one weight, the counterpoise referred to in the\r\n  preceding section, which is seen between the spokes of the wheels of a\r\n  locomotive. Although this method balances the pistons in the\r\n  horizontal plane, and thus allows the pull of the engine on the train\r\n  to be exerted without the variation due to the reciprocation of the\r\n  pistons, yet the force balanced horizontally is introduced vertically\r\n  and appears as a variation of pressure on the rail. In practice about\r\n  two-thirds of the reciprocating weight is balanced in order to keep\r\n  this variation of rail pressure within safe limits. The assumption\r\n  that the pistons of an engine move with simple harmonic motion is\r\n  increasingly erroneous as the ratio of the length of the crank r, to\r\n  the length of the connecting rod l increases. A more accurate though\r\n  still approximate expression for the force on the frame due to the\r\n  acceleration of the piston whose weight is W is given by\r\n\r\n     W              /               r              \\\r\n    --- [omega]² r ( cos [theta] + --- cos 2[theta] )\r\n     g              \\               l              /\r\n\r\n  The conditions regulating the balancing of a system of weights\r\n  reciprocating under the action of accelerating forces given by the\r\n  above expression are investigated in a paper by Otto Schlick, \"On\r\n  Balancing of Steam Engines,\" _Trans, Inst. Nav. Arch._ (1900), and in\r\n  a paper by W. E. Dalby, \"On the Balancing of the Reciprocating Parts\r\n  of Engines, including the Effect of the Connecting Rod\" (ibid., 1901).\r\n  A still more accurate expression than the above is obtained by\r\n  expansion in a Fourier series, regarding which and its bearing on\r\n  balancing engines see a paper by J. H. Macalpine, \"A Solution of the\r\n  Vibration Problem\" (ibid., 1901). The whole subject is dealt with in a\r\n  treatise, _The Balancing of Engines_, by W. E. Dalby (London, 1906).\r\n  Most of the original papers on this subject of engine balancing are to\r\n  be found in the _Transactions_ of the Institution of Naval Architects.\r\n\r\n  § 113.* _Centrifugal Whirling of Shafts._--When a system of revolving\r\n  masses is balanced so that the conditions of the preceding section are\r\n  fulfilled, the centre of gravity of the system lies on the axis of\r\n  revolution. If there is the slightest displacement of the centre of\r\n  gravity of the system from the axis of revolution a force acts on the\r\n  shaft tending to deflect it, and varies as the deflexion and as the\r\n  square of the speed. If the shaft is therefore to revolve stably, this\r\n  force must be balanced at any instant by the elastic resistance of the\r\n  shaft to deflexion. To take a simple case, suppose a shaft, supported\r\n  on two bearings to carry a disk of weight W at its centre, and let the\r\n  centre of gravity of the disk be at a distance e from the axis of\r\n  rotation, this small distance being due to imperfections of material\r\n  or faulty construction. Neglecting the mass of the shaft itself, when\r\n  the shaft rotates with an angular velocity a, the centrifugal force\r\n  Wa²e/g will act upon the shaft and cause its axis to deflect from the\r\n  axis of rotation a distance, y say. The elastic resistance evoked by\r\n  this deflexion is proportional to the deflexion, so that if c is a\r\n  constant depending upon the form, material and method of support of\r\n  the shaft, the following equality must hold if the shaft is to rotate\r\n  stably at the stated speed--\r\n\r\n     W\r\n    ---(y + e)a² = cy,\r\n     g\r\n\r\n  from which y = Wa²e/(gc - Wa²).\r\n\r\n  This expression shows that as a increases y increases until when Wa² =\r\n  gc, y becomes infinitely large. The corresponding value of a, namely\r\n  [root]gc/W, is called the _critical velocity_ of the shaft, and is the\r\n  speed at which the shaft ceases to rotate stably and at which\r\n  centrifugal whirling begins. The general problem is to find the value\r\n  of a corresponding to all kinds of loadings on shafts supported in any\r\n  manner. The question was investigated by Rankine in an article in the\r\n  _Engineer_ (April 9, 1869). Professor A. G. Greenhill treated the\r\n  problem of the centrifugal whirling of an unloaded shaft with\r\n  different supporting conditions in a paper \"On the Strength of\r\n  Shafting exposed both to torsion and to end thrust,\" _Proc. Inst.\r\n  Mech. Eng._ (1883). Professor S. Dunkerley (\"On the Whirling and\r\n  Vibration of Shafts,\" _Phil. Trans._, 1894) investigated the question\r\n  for the cases of loaded and unloaded shafts, and, owing to the\r\n  complication arising from the application of the general theory to the\r\n  cases of loaded shafts, devised empirical formulae for the critical\r\n  speeds of shafts loaded with heavy pulleys, based generally upon the\r\n  following assumption, which is stated for the case of a shaft carrying\r\n  one pulley: If N1, N2 be the separate speeds of whirl of the shaft and\r\n  pulley on the assumption that the effect of one is neglected when that\r\n  of the other is under consideration, then the resulting speed of whirl\r\n  due to both causes combined may be taken to be of the form N1N2\r\n  [root][(N²1 + N1²)] where N means revolutions per minute. This form is\r\n  extended to include the cases of several pulleys on the same shaft.\r\n  The interesting and important part of the investigation is that a\r\n  number of experiments were made on small shafts arranged in different\r\n  ways and loaded in different ways, and the speed at which whirling\r\n  actually occurred was compared with the speed calculated from formulae\r\n  of the general type indicated above. The agreement between the\r\n  observed and calculated values of the critical speeds was in most\r\n  cases quite remarkable. In a paper by Dr C. Chree, \"The Whirling and\r\n  Transverse Vibrations of Rotating Shafts,\" _Proc. Phys. Soc. Lon._,\r\n  vol. 19 (1904); also _Phil. Mag._, vol. 7 (1904), the question is\r\n  investigated from a new mathematical point of view, and expressions\r\n  for the whirling of loaded shafts are obtained without the necessity\r\n  of any assumption of the kind stated above. An elementary presentation\r\n  of the problem from a practical point of view will be found in _Steam\r\n  Turbines_, by Dr A. Stodola (London, 1905).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 131.]\r\n\r\n  § 114. _Revolving Pendulum. Governors._--In fig. 131 AO represents an\r\n  upright axis or spindle; B a weight called a _bob_, suspended by rod\r\n  OB from a horizontal axis at O, carried by the vertical axis. When the\r\n  spindle is at rest the bob hangs close to it; when the spindle\r\n  rotates, the bob, being made to revolve round it, diverges until the\r\n  resultant of the centrifugal force and the weight of the bob is a\r\n  force acting at O in the direction OB, and then it revolves steadily\r\n  in a circle. This combination is called a _revolving_, _centrifugal_,\r\n  or _conical pendulum_. Revolving pendulums are usually constructed\r\n  with _pairs_ of rods and bobs, as OB, Ob, hung at opposite sides of\r\n  the spindle, that the centrifugal forces exerted at the point O may\r\n  balance each other.\r\n\r\n  In finding the position in which the bob will revolve with a given\r\n  angular velocity, a, for most practical cases connected with machinery\r\n  the mass of the rod may be considered as insensible compared with that\r\n  of the bob. Let the bob be a sphere, and from the centre of that\r\n  sphere draw BH = y perpendicular to OA. Let OH = z; let W be the\r\n  weight of the bob, F its centrifugal force. Then the condition of its\r\n  steady revolution is W : F :: z : y; that is to say, y/z = F/W =\r\n  ya²/g; consequently\r\n\r\n    z = g/[alpha]² (69)\r\n\r\n  Or, if n = [alpha] 2[pi] = [alpha]/6.2832 be the number of turns or\r\n  fractions of a turn in a second,\r\n\r\n           g       0.8165 ft.   9.79771 in.  \\\r\n    z = -------- = ---------- = -----------   >  (70)\r\n        4[pi]²n²       n²            n²      /\r\n\r\n  z is called the _altitude of the pendulum_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 132.]\r\n\r\n  If the rod of a revolving pendulum be jointed, as in fig. 132, not to\r\n  a point in the vertical axis, but to the end of a projecting arm C,\r\n  the position in which the bob will revolve will be the same as if the\r\n  rod were jointed to the point O, where its prolongation cuts the\r\n  vertical axis.\r\n\r\n  A revolving pendulum is an essential part of most of the contrivances\r\n  called _governors_, for regulating the speed of prime movers, for\r\n  further particulars of which see STEAM ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Division 3. Working of Machines of Varying Velocity._\r\n\r\n  § 115. _General Principles._--In order that the velocity of every\r\n  piece of a machine may be uniform, it is necessary that the forces\r\n  acting on each piece should be always exactly balanced. Also, in order\r\n  that the forces acting on each piece of a machine may be always\r\n  exactly balanced, it is necessary that the velocity of that piece\r\n  should be uniform.\r\n\r\n  An excess of the effort exerted on any piece, above that which is\r\n  necessary to balance the resistance, is accompanied with acceleration;\r\n  a deficiency of the effort, with retardation.\r\n\r\n  When a machine is being started from a state of rest, and brought by\r\n  degrees up to its proper speed, the effort must be in excess; when it\r\n  is being retarded for the purpose of stopping it, the resistance must\r\n  be in excess.\r\n\r\n  An excess of effort above resistance involves an excess of energy\r\n  exerted above work performed; that excess of energy is employed in\r\n  producing acceleration.\r\n\r\n  An excess of resistance above effort involves an excess of work\r\n  performed above energy expended; that excess of work is performed by\r\n  means of the retardation of the machinery.\r\n\r\n  When a machine undergoes alternate acceleration and retardation, so\r\n  that at certain instants of time, occurring at the end of intervals\r\n  called _periods_ or _cycles_, it returns to its original speed, then\r\n  in each of those periods or cycles the alternate excesses of energy\r\n  and of work neutralize each other; and at the end of each cycle the\r\n  principle of the equality of energy and work stated in § 87, with all\r\n  its consequences, is verified exactly as in the case of machines of\r\n  uniform speed.\r\n\r\n  At intermediate instants, however, other principles have also to be\r\n  taken into account, which are deduced from the second law of motion,\r\n  as applied to _direct deviation_, or acceleration and retardation.\r\n\r\n  § 116. _Energy of Acceleration and Work of Retardation for a Shifting\r\n  Body._--Let w be the weight of a body which has a motion of\r\n  translation in any path, and in the course of the interval of time\r\n  [Delta]t let its velocity be increased at a uniform rate of\r\n  acceleration from v1 to v2. The rate of acceleration will be\r\n\r\n    dv/dt = const. = (v2 - v1)[Delta]t;\r\n\r\n  and to produce this acceleration a uniform effort will be required,\r\n  expressed by\r\n\r\n    P = w(v2 - v1)g[Delta]t  (71)\r\n\r\n  (The product wv/g of the mass of a body by its velocity is called its\r\n  _momentum_; so that the effort required is found by dividing the\r\n  increase of momentum by the time in which it is produced.)\r\n\r\n  To find the _energy_ which has to be exerted to produce the\r\n  acceleration from v1 to v2, it is to be observed that the _distance_\r\n  through which the effort P acts during the acceleration is\r\n\r\n    [Delta]s = (v2 + v1)[Delta]t/2;\r\n\r\n  consequently, the _energy of acceleration_ is\r\n\r\n    P[Delta]s = w(v2 - v1) (v2 + v1)/2g = w(v2² - v1²)2g,  (72)\r\n\r\n  being proportional to the increase in the square of the velocity, and\r\n  _independent of the time_.\r\n\r\n  In order to produce a _retardation_ from the greater velocity v2 to\r\n  the less velocity v1, it is necessary to apply to the body a\r\n  _resistance_ connected with the retardation and the time by an\r\n  equation identical in every respect with equation (71), except by the\r\n  substitution of a resistance for an effort; and in overcoming that\r\n  resistance the body _performs work_ to an amount determined by\r\n  equation (72), putting Rds for Pas.\r\n\r\n  § 117. _Energy Stored and Restored by Deviations of Velocity._--Thus a\r\n  body alternately accelerated and retarded, so as to be brought back to\r\n  its original speed, performs work during its retardation exactly equal\r\n  in amount to the energy exerted upon it during its acceleration; so\r\n  that that energy may be considered as _stored_ during the\r\n  acceleration, and _restored_ during the retardation, in a manner\r\n  analogous to the operation of a reciprocating force (§ 108).\r\n\r\n  Let there be given the mean velocity V = ½(v2 + v1) of a body whose\r\n  weight is w, and let it be required to determine the fluctuation of\r\n  velocity v2 - v1, and the extreme velocities v1, v2, which that body\r\n  must have, in order alternately to store and restore an amount of\r\n  energy E. By equation (72) we have\r\n\r\n    E = w(v2² - v1²)´2g\r\n\r\n  which, being divided by V = ½(v2 + v1), gives\r\n\r\n    E/V = w(v2 - v1)/g;\r\n\r\n  and consequently\r\n\r\n    v2 - v1 = gE/Vw  (73)\r\n\r\n  The ratio of this fluctuation to the mean velocity, sometimes called\r\n  the unsteadiness of the motion of the body, is\r\n\r\n    (v2 - v1)V = gE/V²w.  (74)\r\n\r\n  § 118. _Actual Energy of a Shifting Body._--The energy which must be\r\n  exerted on a body of the weight w, to accelerate it from a state of\r\n  rest up to a given velocity of translation v, and the equal amount of\r\n  work which that body is capable of performing by overcoming resistance\r\n  while being retarded from the same velocity of translation v to a\r\n  state of rest, is\r\n\r\n    wv²/2g.  (75)\r\n\r\n  This is called the _actual energy_ of the motion of the body, and is\r\n  half the quantity which in some treatises is called vis viva.\r\n\r\n  The energy stored or restored, as the case may be, by the deviations\r\n  of velocity of a body or a system of bodies, is the amount by which\r\n  the actual energy is increased or diminished.\r\n\r\n  § 119. _Principle of the Conservation of Energy in Machines._--The\r\n  following principle, expressing the general law of the action of\r\n  machines with a velocity uniform or varying, includes the law of the\r\n  equality of energy and work stated in § 89 for machines of uniform\r\n  speed.\r\n\r\n  _In any given interval during the working of a machine, the energy\r\n  exerted added to the energy restored is equal to the energy stored\r\n  added to the work performed._\r\n\r\n  § 120. _Actual Energy of Circular Translation--Moment of\r\n  Inertia._--Let a small body of the weight w undergo translation in a\r\n  circular path of the radius [rho], with the angular velocity of\r\n  deflexion [alpha], so that the common linear velocity of all its\r\n  particles is v = [alpha][rho]. Then the actual energy of that body is\r\n\r\n    wv²/2g = w[alpha]²p²/2g.  (76)\r\n\r\n  By comparing this with the expression for the centrifugal force\r\n  (w[alpha]²p/g), it appears that the actual energy of a revolving body\r\n  is equal to the potential energy Fp/2 due to the action of the\r\n  deflecting force along one-half of the radius of curvature of the path\r\n  of the body.\r\n\r\n  The product wp²/g, by which the half-square of the angular velocity is\r\n  multiplied, is called the _moment of inertia_ of the revolving body.\r\n\r\n  § 121. _Flywheels._--A flywheel is a rotating piece in a machine,\r\n  generally shaped like a wheel (that is to say, consisting of a rim\r\n  with spokes), and suited to store and restore energy by the periodical\r\n  variations in its angular velocity.\r\n\r\n  The principles according to which variations of angular velocity store\r\n  and restore energy are the same as those of § 117, only substituting\r\n  _moment of inertia_ for _mass_, and _angular_ for _linear_ velocity.\r\n\r\n  Let W be the weight of a flywheel, R its radius of gyration, a2 its\r\n  maximum, a1 its minimum, and A = ½([alpha]2 + [alpha]1) its mean\r\n  angular velocity. Let\r\n\r\n    I/S  = ([alpha]2 - [alpha]2)/A\r\n\r\n  denote the _unsteadiness_ of the motion of the flywheel; the\r\n  denominator S of this fraction is called the _steadiness_. Let e\r\n  denote the quantity by which the energy exerted in each cycle of the\r\n  working of the machine alternately exceeds and falls short of the work\r\n  performed, and which has consequently to be alternately stored by\r\n  acceleration and restored by retardation of the flywheel. The value of\r\n  this _periodical excess_ is--\r\n\r\n    e = R²W ([alpha]2² - [alpha]1²), 2g,  (77)\r\n\r\n  from which, dividing both sides by A², we obtain the following\r\n  equations:--\r\n\r\n    e/A² = R²W/gS     \\\r\n                       >.   (78)\r\n    R²WA²/2g = Se/2   /\r\n\r\n  The latter of these equations may be thus expressed in words: _The\r\n  actual energy due to the rotation of the fly, with its mean angular\r\n  velocity, is equal to one-half of the periodical excess of energy\r\n  multiplied by the steadiness._\r\n\r\n  In ordinary machinery S = about 32; in machinery for fine purposes S =\r\n  from 50 to 60; and when great steadiness is required S = from 100 to\r\n  150.\r\n\r\n  The periodical excess e may arise either from variations in the effort\r\n  exerted by the prime mover, or from variations in the resistance of\r\n  the work, or from both these causes combined. When but one flywheel is\r\n  used, it should be placed in as direct connexion as possible with that\r\n  part of the mechanism where the greatest amount of the periodical\r\n  excess originates; but when it originates at two or more points, it is\r\n  best to have a flywheel in connexion with each of these points. For\r\n  example, in a machine-work, the steam-engine, which is the prime mover\r\n  of the various tools, has a flywheel on the crank-shaft to store and\r\n  restore the periodical excess of energy arising from the variations in\r\n  the effort exerted by the connecting-rod upon the crank; and each of\r\n  the slotting machines, punching machines, riveting machines, and other\r\n  tools has a flywheel of its own to store and restore energy, so as to\r\n  enable the very different resistances opposed to those tools at\r\n  different times to be overcome without too great unsteadiness of\r\n  motion. For tools performing useful work at intervals, and having only\r\n  their own friction to overcome during the intermediate intervals, e\r\n  should be assumed equal to the whole work performed at each separate\r\n  operation.\r\n\r\n  § 122. _Brakes._--A brake is an apparatus for stopping and diminishing\r\n  the velocity of a machine by friction, such as the friction-strap\r\n  already referred to in § 103. To find the distance s through which a\r\n  brake, exerting the friction F, must rub in order to stop a machine\r\n  having the total actual energy E at the moment when the brake begins\r\n  to act, reduce, by the principles of § 96, the various efforts and\r\n  other resistances of the machine which act at the same time with the\r\n  friction of the brake to the rubbing surface of the brake, and let R\r\n  be their resultant--positive if _resistance_, _negative_ if effort\r\n  preponderates. Then\r\n\r\n    s = E/(F + R).  (79)\r\n\r\n  § 123. _Energy distributed between two Bodies: Projection and\r\n  Propulsion._--Hitherto the effort by which a machine is moved has been\r\n  treated as a force exerted between a movable body and a fixed body, so\r\n  that the whole energy exerted by it is employed upon the movable body,\r\n  and none upon the fixed body. This conception is sensibly realized in\r\n  practice when one of the two bodies between which the effort acts is\r\n  either so heavy as compared with the other, or has so great a\r\n  resistance opposed to its motion, that it may, without sensible error,\r\n  be treated as fixed. But there are cases in which the motions of both\r\n  bodies are appreciable, and must be taken into account--such as the\r\n  projection of projectiles, where the velocity of the _recoil_ or\r\n  backward motion of the gun bears an appreciable proportion to the\r\n  forward motion of the projectile; and such as the propulsion of\r\n  vessels, where the velocity of the water thrown backward by the\r\n  paddle, screw or other propeller bears a very considerable proportion\r\n  to the velocity of the water moved forwards and sideways by the ship.\r\n  In cases of this kind the energy exerted by the effort is\r\n  _distributed_ between the two bodies between which the effort is\r\n  exerted in shares proportional to the velocities of the two bodies\r\n  during the action of the effort; and those velocities are to each\r\n  other directly as the portions of the effort unbalanced by resistance\r\n  on the respective bodies, and inversely as the weights of the bodies.\r\n\r\n  To express this symbolically, let W1, W2 be the weights of the bodies;\r\n  P the effort exerted between them; S the distance through which it\r\n  acts; R1, R2 the resistances opposed to the effort overcome by W1, W2\r\n  respectively; E1, E2 the shares of the whole energy E exerted upon W1,\r\n  W2 respectively. Then\r\n\r\n                         E     :   E1    :   E2     \\\r\n       W2(P - R1) + W1(P - R2)   P - R1    P - R2   |\r\n    :: ----------------------- : ------  : ------    >.  (80)\r\n                 W1W2              W1        W2     /\r\n\r\n  If R1 = R2, which is the case when the resistance, as well as the\r\n  effort, arises from the mutual actions of the two bodies, the above\r\n  becomes,\r\n\r\n             E : E1 : E2  \\\r\n    :: W1 + W2 : W2 : W1  /,  (81)\r\n\r\n  that is to say, the energy is exerted on the bodies in shares\r\n  inversely proportional to their weights; and they receive\r\n  accelerations inversely proportional to their weights, according to\r\n  the principle of dynamics, already quoted in a note to § 110, that the\r\n  mutual actions of a system of bodies do not affect the motion of their\r\n  common centre of gravity.\r\n\r\n  For example, if the weight of a gun be 160 times that of its ball\r\n  160/161 of the energy exerted by the powder in exploding will be\r\n  employed in propelling the ball, and 1/161 in producing the recoil of\r\n  the gun, provided the gun up to the instant of the ball's quitting the\r\n  muzzle meets with no resistance to its recoil except the friction of\r\n  the ball.\r\n\r\n  § 124. _Centre of Percussion._--It is obviously desirable that the\r\n  deviations or changes of motion of oscillating pieces in machinery\r\n  should, as far as possible, be effected by forces applied at their\r\n  centres of percussion.\r\n\r\n  If the deviation be a _translation_--that is, an equal change of\r\n  motion of all the particles of the body--the centre of percussion is\r\n  obviously the centre of gravity itself; and, according to the second\r\n  law of motion, if dv be the deviation of velocity to be produced in\r\n  the interval dt, and W the weight of the body, then\r\n\r\n         W    dv\r\n    P = --- · --  (82)\r\n         g    dt\r\n\r\n  is the unbalanced effort required.\r\n\r\n  If the deviation be a rotation about an axis traversing the centre of\r\n  gravity, there is no centre of percussion; for such a deviation can\r\n  only be produced by a _couple_ of forces, and not by any single force.\r\n  Let d[alpha] be the deviation of angular velocity to be produced in\r\n  the interval dt, and I the moment of the inertia of the body about an\r\n  axis through its centre of gravity; then ½Id([alpha]^2) = I[alpha]\r\n  d[alpha] is the variation of the body's actual energy. Let M be the\r\n  moment of the unbalanced couple required to produce the deviation;\r\n  then by equation 57, § 104, the energy exerted by this couple in the\r\n  interval dt is M[alpha] dt, which, being equated to the variation of\r\n  energy, gives\r\n\r\n         d[alpha]   R²W   d[alpha]\r\n    M = I-------- = --- · --------.  (83)\r\n            dt       g       dt\r\n\r\n  R is called the radius of gyration of the body with regard to an axis\r\n  through its centre of gravity.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 133.]\r\n\r\n  Now (fig. 133) let the required deviation be a rotation of the body BB\r\n  about an axis O, not traversing the centre of gravity G, d[alpha]\r\n  being, as before, the deviation of angular velocity to be produced in\r\n  the interval dt. A rotation with the angular velocity [alpha] about an\r\n  axis O may be considered as compounded of a rotation with the same\r\n  angular velocity about an axis drawn through G parallel to O and a\r\n  translation with the velocity [alpha]. OG, OG being the perpendicular\r\n  distance between the two axes. Hence the required deviation may be\r\n  regarded as compounded of a deviation of translation dv = OG·d[alpha],\r\n  to produce which there would be required, according to equation (82),\r\n  a force applied at G perpendicular to the plane OG--\r\n\r\n         W         d[alpha]\r\n    P = --- · OG · --------  (84)\r\n         g            dt\r\n\r\n  and a deviation d[alpha] of rotation about an axis drawn through G\r\n  parallel to O, to produce which there would be required a couple of\r\n  the moment M given by equation (83). According to the principles of\r\n  statics, the resultant of the force P, applied at G perpendicular to\r\n  the plane OG, and the couple M is a force equal and parallel to P, but\r\n  applied at a distance GC from G, in the prolongation of the\r\n  perpendicular OG, whose value is\r\n\r\n    GC = M/P = R²/OG.  (85)\r\n\r\n  Thus is determined the position of the centre of percussion C,\r\n  corresponding to the axis of rotation O. It is obvious from this\r\n  equation that, for an axis of rotation parallel to O traversing C, the\r\n  centre of percussion is at the point where the perpendicular OG meets\r\n  O.\r\n\r\n  § 125.* _To find the moment of inertia of a body about an axis through\r\n  its centre of gravity experimentally._--Suspend the body from any\r\n  conveniently selected axis O (fig. 48) and hang near it a small plumb\r\n  bob. Adjust the length of the plumb-line until it and the body\r\n  oscillate together in unison. The length of the plumb-line, measured\r\n  from its point of suspension to the centre of the bob, is for all\r\n  practical purposes equal to the length OC, C being therefore the\r\n  centre of percussion corresponding to the selected axis O. From\r\n  equation (85)\r\n\r\n    R^2 = CG × OG = (OC - OG)OG.\r\n\r\n  The position of G can be found experimentally; hence OG is known, and\r\n  the quantity R² can be calculated, from which and the ascertained\r\n  weight W of the body the moment of inertia about an axis through G,\r\n  namely, W/g × R², can be computed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 134.]\r\n\r\n  § 126.* _To find the force competent to produce the instantaneous\r\n  acceleration of any link of a mechanism._--In many practical problems\r\n  it is necessary to know the magnitude and position of the forces\r\n  acting to produce the accelerations of the several links of a\r\n  mechanism. For a given link, this force is the resultant of all the\r\n  accelerating forces distributed through the substance of the material\r\n  of the link required to produce the requisite acceleration of each\r\n  particle, and the determination of this force depends upon the\r\n  principles of the two preceding sections. The investigation of the\r\n  distribution of the forces through the material and the stress\r\n  consequently produced belongs to the subject of the STRENGTH OF\r\n  MATERIALS (q.v.). Let BK (fig. 134) be any link moving in any manner\r\n  in a plane, and let G be its centre of gravity. Then its motion may be\r\n  analysed into (1) a translation of its centre of gravity; and (2) a\r\n  rotation about an axis through its centre of gravity perpendicular to\r\n  its plane of motion. Let [alpha] be the acceleration of the centre of\r\n  gravity and let A be the angular acceleration about the axis through\r\n  the centre of gravity; then the force required to produce the\r\n  translation of the centre of gravity is F = W[alpha]/g, and the couple\r\n  required to produce the angular acceleration about the centre of\r\n  gravity is M = IA/g, W and I being respectively the weight and the\r\n  moment of inertia of the link about the axis through the centre of\r\n  gravity. The couple M may be produced by shifting the force F parallel\r\n  to itself through a distance x. such that Fx = M. When the link forms\r\n  part of a mechanism the respective accelerations of two points in the\r\n  link can be determined by means of the velocity and acceleration\r\n  diagrams described in § 82, it being understood that the motion of one\r\n  link in the mechanism is prescribed, for instance, in the\r\n  steam-engine's mechanism that the crank shall revolve uniformly. Let\r\n  the acceleration of the two points B and K therefore be supposed\r\n  known. The problem is now to find the acceleration [alpha] and A. Take\r\n  any pole O (fig. 49), and set out Ob equal to the acceleration of B\r\n  and Ok equal to the acceleration of K. Join bk and take the point g so\r\n  that KG: GB = kg : gb. Og is then the acceleration of the centre of\r\n  gravity and the force F can therefore be immediately calculated. To\r\n  find the angular acceleration A, draw kt, bt respectively parallel to\r\n  and at right angles to the link KB. Then tb represents the angular\r\n  acceleration of the point B relatively to the point K and hence tb/KB\r\n  is the value of A, the angular acceleration of the link. Its moment of\r\n  inertia about G can be found experimentally by the method explained in\r\n  § 125, and then the value of the couple M can be computed. The value\r\n  of x is found immediately from the quotient M/F. Hence the magnitude F\r\n  and the position of F relatively to the centre of gravity of the link,\r\n  necessary to give rise to the couple M, are known, and this force is\r\n  therefore the resultant force required.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 135.]\r\n\r\n  § 127.* _Alternative construction for finding the position of F\r\n  relatively to the centre of gravity of the link._--Let B and K be any\r\n  two points in the link which for greater generality are taken in fig.\r\n  135, so that the centre of gravity G is not in the line joining them.\r\n  First find the value of R experimentally. Then produce the given\r\n  directions of acceleration of B and K to meet in O; draw a circle\r\n  through the three points B, K and O; produce the line joining O and G\r\n  to cut the circle in Y; and take a point Z on the line OY so that YG ×\r\n  GZ = R². Then Z is a point in the line of action of the force F. This\r\n  useful theorem is due to G. T. Bennett, of Emmanuel College,\r\n  Cambridge. A proof of it and three corollaries are given in appendix 4\r\n  of the second edition of Dalby's _Balancing of Engines_ (London,\r\n  1906). It is to be noticed that only the directions of the\r\n  accelerations of two points are required to find the point Z.\r\n\r\n  For an example of the application of the principles of the two\r\n  preceding sections to a practical problem see _Valve and Valve Gear\r\n  Mechanisms_, by W. E. Dalby (London, 1906), where the inertia stresses\r\n  brought upon the several links of a Joy valve gear, belonging to an\r\n  express passenger engine of the Lancashire & Yorkshire railway, are\r\n  investigated for an engine-speed of 68 m. an hour.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 136.]\r\n\r\n  § 128.* _The Connecting Rod Problem._--A particular problem of\r\n  practical importance is the determination of the force producing the\r\n  motion of the connecting rod of a steam-engine mechanism of the usual\r\n  type. The methods of the two preceding sections may be used when the\r\n  acceleration of two points in the rod are known. In this problem it is\r\n  usually assumed that the crank pin K (fig. 136) moves with uniform\r\n  velocity, so that if [alpha] is its angular velocity and r its radius,\r\n  the acceleration is [alpha]²r in a direction along the crank arm from\r\n  the crank pin to the centre of the shaft. Thus the acceleration of one\r\n  point K is known completely. The acceleration of a second point,\r\n  usually taken at the centre of the crosshead pin, can be found by the\r\n  principles of § 82, but several special geometrical constructions have\r\n  been devised for this purpose, notably the construction of Klein,[4]\r\n  discovered also independently by Kirsch.[5] But probably the most\r\n  convenient is the construction due to G. T. Bennett[6] which is as\r\n  follows: Let OK be the crank and KB the connecting rod. On the\r\n  connecting rod take a point L such that KL × KB = KO². Then, the crank\r\n  standing at any angle with the line of stroke, draw LP at right angles\r\n  to the connecting rod, PN at right angles to the line of stroke OB and\r\n  NA at right angles to the connecting rod; then AO is the acceleration\r\n  of the point B to the scale on which KO represents the acceleration of\r\n  the point K. The proof of this construction is given in _The Balancing\r\n  of Engines_.\r\n\r\n  The finding of F may be continued thus: join AK, then AK is the\r\n  acceleration image of the rod, OKA being the acceleration diagram.\r\n  Through G, the centre of gravity of the rod, draw Gg parallel to the\r\n  line of stroke, thus dividing the image at g in the proportion that\r\n  the connecting rod is divided by G. Hence Og represents the\r\n  acceleration of the centre of gravity and, the weight of the\r\n  connecting rod being ascertained, F can be immediately calculated. To\r\n  find a point in its line of action, take a point Q on the rod such\r\n  that KG × GQ = R², R having been determined experimentally by the\r\n  method of § 125; join G with O and through Q draw a line parallel to\r\n  BO to cut GO in Z. Z is a point in the line of action of the resultant\r\n  force F; hence through Z draw a line parallel to Og. The force F acts\r\n  in this line, and thus the problem is completely solved. The above\r\n  construction for Z is a corollary of the general theorem given in §\r\n  127.\r\n\r\n  § 129. _Impact._ Impact or collision is a pressure of short duration\r\n  exerted between two bodies.\r\n\r\n  The effects of impact are sometimes an alteration of the distribution\r\n  of actual energy between the two bodies, and always a loss of a\r\n  portion of that energy, depending on the imperfection of the\r\n  elasticity of the bodies, in permanently altering their figures, and\r\n  producing heat. The determination of the distribution of the actual\r\n  energy after collision and of the loss of energy is effected by means\r\n  of the following principles:--\r\n\r\n  I. The motion of the common centre of gravity of the two bodies is\r\n  unchanged by the collision.\r\n\r\n  II. The loss of energy consists of a certain proportion of that part\r\n  of the actual energy of the bodies which is due to their motion\r\n  relatively to their common centre of gravity.\r\n\r\n  Unless there is some special reason for using impact in machines, it\r\n  ought to be avoided, on account not only of the waste of energy which\r\n  it causes, but from the damage which it occasions to the frame and\r\n  mechanism.

Considerable additions, however, have\r\n    been introduced in order to indicate subsequent developments of the\r\n    subject; the new sections are numbered continuously with the old, but\r\n    are distinguished by an asterisk. Also, two short chapters which\r\n    concluded the original article have been omitted--ch. iii., \"On\r\n    Purposes and Effects of Machines,\" which was really a classification\r\n    of machines, because the classification of Franz Reuleaux is now\r\n    usually followed, and ch. iv., \"Applied Energetics, or Theory of\r\n    Prime Movers,\" because its subject matter is now treated in various\r\n    special articles, e.g. Hydraulics, Steam Engine, Gas Engine, Oil\r\n    Engine, and fully developed in Rankine's The Steam Engine and Other\r\n    Prime Movers (London, 1902). (Ed. _E.B._)\r\n\r\n  [2] Since the relation discussed in § 7 was enunciated by Rankine, an\r\n    enormous development has taken place in the subject of Graphic\r\n    Statics, the first comprehensive textbook on the subject being _Die\r\n    Graphische Statik_ by K. Culmann, published at Zürich in 1866. Many\r\n    of the graphical methods therein given have now passed into the\r\n    textbooks usually studied by engineers. One of the most beautiful\r\n    graphical constructions regularly used by engineers and known as \"the\r\n    method of reciprocal figures\" is that for finding the loads supported\r\n    by the several members of a braced structure, having given a system\r\n    of external loads. The method was discovered by Clerk Maxwell, and\r\n    the complete theory is discussed and exemplified in a paper \"On\r\n    Reciprocal Figures, Frames and Diagrams of Forces,\" _Trans. Roy. Soc.\r\n    Ed._, vol. xxvi. (1870). Professor M. W. Crofton read a paper on\r\n    \"Stress-Diagrams in Warren and Lattice Girders\" at the meeting of the\r\n    Mathematical Society (April 13, 1871), and Professor O. Henrici\r\n    illustrated the subject by a simple and ingenious notation. The\r\n    application of the method of reciprocal figures was facilitated by a\r\n    system of notation published in _Economics of Construction in\r\n    relation to framed Structures_, by Robert H. Bow (London, 1873). A\r\n    notable work on the general subject is that of Luigi Cremona,\r\n    translated from the Italian by Professor T. H. Beare (Oxford, 1890),\r\n    and a discussion of the subject of reciprocal figures from the\r\n    special point of view of the engineering student is given in _Vectors\r\n    and Rotors_ by Henrici and Turner (London, 1903).

N. of Albany; on the Delaware\r\n& Hudson and Boston & Maine railways. Pop. (1900), 4695 (702\r\nforeign-born); (1905, state census), 5877; (1910) 6,634. It lies partly\r\nwithin Stillwater and partly within Half-Moon townships, in the\r\nbottom-lands at the mouth of the Anthony Kill, about 1-1/2 m. S. of the\r\nmouth of the Hoosick River. On the north and south are hills reaching a\r\nmaximum height of 200 ft. There is ample water power, and there are\r\nmanufactures of paper, sash and blinds, fibre, &c. From a dam here power\r\nis derived for the General Electric Company at Schenectady. The first\r\nsettlement in this vicinity was made in what is now Half-Moon township\r\nabout 1680. Mechanicville (originally called Burrow) was chartered by\r\nthe county court in 1859, and incorporated as a village in 1870. It was\r\nthe birthplace of Colonel Ephraim Elmer Ellsworth (1837-1861), the first\r\nFederal officer to lose his life in the Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHITHARISTS, a congregation of Armenian monks in communion with the\r\nChurch of Rome. The founder, Mechithar, was born at Sebaste in Armenia,\r\n1676. He entered a monastery, but under the influence of Western\r\nmissionaries he became possessed with the idea of propagating Western\r\nideas and culture in Armenia, and of converting the Armenian Church from\r\nits monophysitism and uniting it to the Latin Church. Mechithar set out\r\nfor Rome in 1695 to make his ecclesiastical studies there, but he was\r\ncompelled by illness to abandon the journey and return to Armenia. In\r\n1696 he was ordained priest and for four years worked among his people.\r\nIn 1700 he went to Constantinople and began to gather disciples around\r\nhim. Mechithar formally joined the Latin Church, and in 1701, with\r\nsixteen companions, he formed a definitely religious institute of which\r\nhe became the superior. Their Uniat propaganda encountered the\r\nopposition of the Armenians and they were compelled to move to the\r\nMorea, at that time Venetian territory, and there built a monastery,\r\n1706. On the outbreak of hostilities between the Turks and Venetians\r\nthey migrated to Venice, and the island of St Lazzaro was bestowed on\r\nthem, 1717. This has since been the headquarters of the congregation,\r\nand here Mechithar died in 1749, leaving his institute firmly\r\nestablished. The rule followed at first was that attributed to St\r\nAnthony; but when they settled in the West modifications from the\r\nBenedictine rule were introduced, and the Mechitharists are numbered\r\namong the lesser orders affiliated to the Benedictines. They have ever\r\nbeen faithful to their founder's programme. Their work has been\r\nfourfold: (1) they have brought out editions of important patristic\r\nworks, some Armenian, others translated into Armenian from Greek and\r\nSyriac originals no longer extant; (2) they print and circulate Armenian\r\nliterature among the Armenians, and thereby exercise a powerful\r\neducational influence; (3) they carry on schools both in Europe and\r\nAsia, in which Uniat Armenian boys receive a good secondary education;\r\n(4) they work as Uniat missioners in Armenia. The congregation is\r\ndivided into two branches, the head houses being at St Lazzaro and\r\nVienna. They have fifteen establishments in various places in Asia Minor\r\nand Europe. There are some 150 monks, all Armenians; they use the\r\nArmenian language and rite in the liturgy.\r\n\r\n  See _Vita del servo di Dio Mechitar_ (Venice, 1901); E.

It embraces the\r\nduchies of Schwerin and Güstrow, the district of Rostock, the\r\nprincipality of Schwerin, and the barony of Wismar, besides several\r\nsmall enclaves (Ahrensberg, Rosson, Tretzeband, &c.) in the adjacent\r\nterritories. Its area is 5080 sq. m. Pop. (1905), 625,045.\r\n\r\nMECKLENBURG-STRELITZ consists of two detached parts, the duchy of\r\nStrelitz on the E. of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and the principality of\r\nRatzeburg on the W. The first is bounded by Mecklenburg-Schwerin,\r\nPomerania and Brandenburg, the second by Mecklenburg-Schwerin,\r\nLauenburg, and the territory of the free town of Lübeck. Their joint\r\narea is 1130 sq. m. Pop. (1905), 103,451.\r\n\r\n  Mecklenburg lies wholly within the great North-European plain, and its\r\n  flat surface is interrupted only by one range of low hills,\r\n  intersecting the country from south-east to north-west, and forming\r\n  the watershed between the Baltic Sea and the Elbe. Its highest point,\r\n  the Helpter Berg, is 587 ft. above sea-level. The coast-line runs for\r\n  65 m. along the Baltic (without including indentations), for the most\r\n  part in flat sandy stretches covered with dunes. The chief inlets are\r\n  Wismar Bay, the Salzhaff, and the roads of Warnemünde. The rivers are\r\n  numerous though small; most of them are affluents of the Elbe, which\r\n  traverses a small portion of Mecklenburg. Several are navigable, and\r\n  the facilities for inland water traffic are increased by canals. Lakes\r\n  are numerous; about four hundred, covering an area of 500 sq. m., are\r\n  reckoned in the two duchies. The largest is Lake Müritz, 52 sq. m. in\r\n  extent. The climate resembles that of Great Britain, but the winters\r\n  are generally more severe; the mean annual temperature is 48° F., and\r\n  the annual rainfall is about 28 in. Although there are long stretches\r\n  of marshy moorland along the coast, the soil is on the whole\r\n  productive. About 57% of the total area of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\r\n  consists of cultivated land, 18% of forest, and 13% of heath and\r\n  pasture. In Mecklenburg-Strelitz the corresponding figures are 47, 21\r\n  and 10%. Agriculture is by far the most important industry in both\r\n  duchies. The chief crops are rye, oats, wheat, potatoes and hay.\r\n  Smaller areas are devoted to maize, buckwheat, pease, rape, hemp,\r\n  flax, hops and tobacco. The extensive pastures support large herds of\r\n  sheep and cattle, including a noteworthy breed of merino sheep. The\r\n  horses of Mecklenburg are of a fine sturdy quality and highly\r\n  esteemed. Red deer, wild swine and various other game are found in the\r\n  forests. The industrial establishments include a few iron-foundries,\r\n  wool-spinning mills, carriage and machine factories, dyeworks,\r\n  tanneries, brick-fields, soap-works, breweries, distilleries, numerous\r\n  limekilns and tar-boiling works, tobacco and cigar factories, and\r\n  numerous mills of various kinds. Mining is insignificant, though a\r\n  fair variety of minerals is represented in the district. Amber is\r\n  found on and near the Baltic coast. Rostock, Warnemünde and Wismar are\r\n  the principal commercial centres. The chief exports are grain and\r\n  other agricultural produce, live stock, spirits, wood and wool; the\r\n  chief imports are colonial produce, iron, coal, salt, wine, beer and\r\n  tobacco. The horse and wool markets of Mecklenburg are largely\r\n  attended by buyers from various parts of Germany. Fishing is carried\r\n  on extensively in the numerous inland lakes.\r\n\r\n  In 1907 the grand dukes of both duchies promised a constitution to\r\n  their subjects. The duchies had always been under a government of\r\n  feudal character, the grand dukes having the executive entirely in\r\n  their hands (though acting through ministers), while the duchies\r\n  shared a diet (_Landtag_), meeting for a short session each year, and\r\n  at other times represented by a committee, and consisting of the\r\n  proprietors of knights' estates (_Rittergüter_), known as the\r\n  _Ritterschaft_, and the _Landschaft_ or burgomasters of certain towns.\r\n  Mecklenburg-Schwerin returns six members to the Reichstag and\r\n  Mecklenburg-Strelitz one member.\r\n\r\n  In Mecklenburg-Schwerin the chief towns are Rostock (with a\r\n  university), Schwerin, and Wismar the capital. The capital of\r\n  Mecklenburg-Strelitz is Neu-Strelitz. The peasantry of Mecklenburg\r\n  retain traces of their Slavonic origin, especially in speech, but\r\n  their peculiarities have been much modified by amalgamation with\r\n  German colonists. The townspeople and nobility are almost wholly of\r\n  Saxon strain. The slowness of the increase in population is chiefly\r\n  accounted for by emigration.\r\n\r\n_History._--The Teutonic peoples, who in the time of Tacitus occupied\r\nthe region now known as Mecklenburg, were succeeded in the 6th century\r\nby some Slavonic tribes, one of these being the Obotrites, whose chief\r\nfortress was Michilenburg, the modern Mecklenburg, near Wismar; hence\r\nthe name of the country. Though partly subdued by Charlemagne towards\r\nthe close of the 8th century, they soon regained their independence, and\r\nuntil the 10th century no serious effort was made by their Christian\r\nneighbours to subject them. Then the German king, Henry the Fowler,\r\nreduced the Slavs of Mecklenburg to obedience and introduced\r\nChristianity among them. During the period of weakness through which the\r\nGerman kingdom passed under the later Ottos, however, they wrenched\r\nthemselves free from this bondage; the 11th and the early part of the\r\n12th century saw the ebb and flow of the tide of conquest, and then came\r\nthe effective subjugation of Mecklenburg by Henry the Lion, duke of\r\nSaxony. The Obotrite prince Niklot was killed in battle in 1160 whilst\r\nresisting the Saxons, but his son Pribislaus (d. 1178) submitted to\r\nHenry the Lion, married his daughter to the son of the duke, embraced\r\nChristianity, and was permitted to retain his office. His descendants\r\nand successors, the present grand dukes of Mecklenburg, are the only\r\nruling princes of Slavonic origin in Germany. Henry the Lion introduced\r\nGerman settlers and restored the bishoprics of Ratzeburg and Schwerin;\r\nin 1170 the emperor Frederick I. made Pribislaus a prince of the empire.\r\nFrom 1214 to 1227 Mecklenburg was under the supremacy of Denmark; then,\r\nin 1229, after it had been regained by the Germans, there took place the\r\nfirst of the many divisions of territory which with subsequent reunions\r\nconstitute much of its complicated history. At this time the country was\r\ndivided between four princes, grandsons of duke Henry Borwin, who had\r\ndied two years previously. But in less than a century the families of\r\ntwo of these princes became extinct, and after dividing into three\r\nbranches a third family suffered the same fate in 1436. There then\r\nremained only the line ruling in Mecklenburg proper, and the princes of\r\nthis family, in addition to inheriting the lands of their dead kinsmen,\r\nmade many additions to their territory, including the counties of\r\nSchwerin and of Strelitz. In 1352 the two princes of this family made a\r\ndivision of their lands, Stargard being separated from the rest of the\r\ncountry to form a principality for John (d. 1393), but on the extinction\r\nof his line in 1471 the whole of Mecklenburg was again united under a\r\nsingle ruler. One member of this family, Albert (c. 1338-1412), was king\r\nof Sweden from 1364 to 1389. In 1348 the emperor Charles IV. had raised\r\nMecklenburg to the rank of a duchy, and in 1418 the university of\r\nRostock was founded.\r\n\r\nThe troubles which arose from the rivalry and jealousy of two or more\r\njoint rulers incited the prelates, the nobles and the burghers to form a\r\nunion among themselves, and the results of this are still visible in the\r\nexistence of the _Landesunion_ for the whole country which was\r\nestablished in 1523. About the same time the teaching of Luther and the\r\nreformers was welcomed in Mecklenburg, although Duke Albert (d. 1547)\r\nsoon reverted to the Catholic faith; in 1549 Lutheranism was recognized\r\nas the state religion; a little later the churches and schools were\r\nreformed and most of the monasteries were suppressed. A division of the\r\nland which took place in 1555 was of short duration, but a more\r\nimportant one was effected in 1611, although Duke John Albert I. (d.\r\n1576) had introduced the principle of primogeniture and had forbidden\r\nall further divisions of territory. By this partition John Albert's\r\ngrandson Adolphus Frederick I. (d. 1658) received Schwerin, and another\r\ngrandson John Albert II. (d. 1636) received Güstrow. The town of\r\nRostock \"with its university and high court of justice\" was declared to\r\nbe common property, while the Diet or _Landtag_ also retained its joint\r\ncharacter, its meetings being held alternately at Sternberg and at\r\nMalchin.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the Thirty Years' War the dukes of\r\nMecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Güstrow were on the Protestant\r\nside, but about 1627 they submitted to the emperor Ferdinand II. This\r\ndid not prevent Ferdinand from promising their land to Wallenstein, who,\r\nhaving driven out the dukes, was invested with the duchies in 1629 and\r\nruled them until 1631. In this year the former rulers were restored by\r\nGustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and in 1635 they came to terms with the\r\nemperor and signed the peace of Prague, but their land continued to be\r\nravaged by both sides until the conclusion of the war. In 1648 by the\r\nTreaty of Westphalia, Wismar and some other parts of Mecklenburg were\r\nsurrendered to Sweden, the recompense assigned to the duchies including\r\nthe secularized bishoprics of Schwerin and of Ratzeburg. The sufferings\r\nof the peasants in Mecklenburg during the Thirty Years' War were not\r\nexceeded by those of their class in any other part of Germany; most of\r\nthem were reduced to a state of serfdom and in some cases whole villages\r\nvanished. Christian Louis who ruled Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1658 until\r\nhis death in 1692 was, like his father Adolphus Frederick, frequently at\r\nvariance with the estates of the land and with members of his family. He\r\nwas a Roman Catholic and a supporter of Louis XIV., and his country\r\nsuffered severely during the wars waged by France and her allies in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn June 1692 when Christian Louis died in exile and without sons, a\r\ndispute arose about the succession to his duchy between his brother\r\nAdolphus Frederick and his nephew Frederick William. The emperor and the\r\nrulers of Sweden and of Brandenburg took part in this struggle which was\r\nintensified when, three years later, on the death of Duke Gustavus\r\nAdolphus, the family ruling over Mecklenburg-Güstrow became extinct. At\r\nlength the partition Treaty of Hamburg was signed on the 8th of March\r\n1701, and a new division of the country was made. Mecklenburg was\r\ndivided between the two claimants, the shares given to each being\r\nrepresented by the existing duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the part\r\nwhich fell to Frederick William, and Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the share of\r\nAdolphus Frederick. At the same time the principle of primogeniture was\r\nagain asserted, and the right of summoning the joint _Landtag_ was\r\nreserved to the ruler of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\r\n\r\nMecklenburg-Schwerin began its existence by a series of constitutional\r\nstruggles between the duke and the nobles. The heavy debt incurred by\r\nDuke Charles Leopold (d. 1747), who had joined Russia in a war against\r\nSweden, brought matters to a crisis; the emperor Charles VI. interfered\r\nand in 1728 the imperial court of justice declared the duke incapable of\r\ngoverning and his brother Christian Louis was appointed administrator of\r\nthe duchy. Under this prince, who became ruler _de jure_ in 1747, there\r\nwas signed in April 1755 the convention of Rostock by which a new\r\nconstitution was framed for the duchy. By this instrument all power was\r\nin the hands of the duke, the nobles and the upper classes generally,\r\nthe lower classes being entirely unrepresented. During the Seven Years'\r\nWar Duke Frederick (d. 1785) took up a hostile attitude towards\r\nFrederick the Great, and in consequence Mecklenburg was occupied by\r\nPrussian troops, but in other ways his rule was beneficial to the\r\ncountry. In the early years of the French revolutionary wars Duke\r\nFrederick Francis I. (1756-1837) remained neutral, and in 1803 he\r\nregained Wismar from Sweden, but in 1806 his land was overrun by the\r\nFrench and in 1808 he joined the Confederation of the Rhine. He was the\r\nfirst member of the confederation to abandon Napoleon, to whose armies\r\nhe had sent a contingent, and in 1813-1814 he fought against France. In\r\n1815 he joined the Germanic Confederation (Bund) and took the title of\r\ngrand duke. In 1819 serfdom was abolished in his dominions. During the\r\nmovement of 1848 the duchy witnessed a considerable agitation in favour\r\nof a more liberal constitution, but in the subsequent reaction all the\r\nconcessions which had been made to the democracy were withdrawn and\r\nfurther restrictive measures were introduced in 1851 and 1852.\r\n\r\nMecklenburg-Strelitz adopted the constitution of the sister duchy by an\r\nact of September 1755. In 1806 it was spared the infliction of a French\r\noccupation through the good offices of the king of Bavaria; in 1808 its\r\nduke, Charles (d. 1816), joined the confederation of the Rhine, but in\r\n1813 he withdrew therefrom. Having been a member of the alliance against\r\nNapoleon he joined the Germanic confederation in 1815 and assumed the\r\ntitle of grand duke.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 both the grand dukes of Mecklenburg joined the North German\r\nconfederation and the _Zollverein_, and began to pass more and more\r\nunder the influence of Prussia, who in the war with Austria had been\r\naided by the soldiers of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In the Franco-German War\r\nalso Prussia received valuable assistance from Mecklenburg, Duke\r\nFrederick Francis II. (1823-1883), an ardent advocate of German unity,\r\nholding a high command in her armies. In 1871 the two grand duchies\r\nbecame states of the German Empire. There was now a renewal of the\r\nagitation for a more democratic constitution, and the German Reichstag\r\ngave some countenance to this movement. In 1897 Frederick Francis IV.\r\n(b. 1882) succeeded his father Frederick Francis III. (1851-1897) as\r\ngrand duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and in 1904 Adolphus Frederick (b.\r\n1848) a son of the grand duke Frederick William (1819-1904) and his wife\r\nAugusta Carolina, daughter of Adolphus Frederick, duke of Cambridge,\r\nbecame grand duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The grand dukes still style\r\nthemselves princes of the Wends.\r\n\r\n  See F. A. Rudloff, _Pragmatisches Handbuch der mecklenburgischen\r\n  Geschichte_ (Schwerin, 1780-1822); C. C.
