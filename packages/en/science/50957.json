BALDWIN\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN RESERVE HISTORICAL SOCIETY\r\n\r\nCLEVELAND\r\n\r\nTHIS VOLUME IS DEDICATED\r\n\r\nIN RECOGNITION OF\r\n\r\nHIS SAGACIOUS AND UNFAILING INTEREST IN\r\n\r\nTHE INVESTIGATIONS WHICH HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince, as stated in the Introduction (page 1), the plan of this volume\r\npermitted only \"a concise presentation of the facts,\" it was impossible\r\nto introduce either full references to the illimitable literature of\r\nthe subject or detailed discussion of all disputed points. The facts\r\nselected, therefore, were for the most part those upon which it was\r\nsupposed there would be pretty general agreement.\r\n\r\nThe discussion upon the subject of the continuity of the Glacial period\r\nwas, however, somewhat elaborate (see pages 106-121, 311, 324, 332),\r\nand was presented with excessive respect for the authority of those who\r\nmaintain the opposite view; all that was claimed (page 110) being that\r\none might maintain the _unity_ or _continuity_ of the Glacial period\r\n\"without forfeiting his right to the respect of his fellow-geologists.\"\r\nBut it already appears that there was no need of this extreme modesty of\r\nstatement. On the contrary, the vigorous discussion of the subject which\r\nhas characterized the last two years reveals a decided reaction against\r\nthe theory that there has been more than one Glacial epoch in Quaternary\r\ntimes; while there have been brought to light many most important if not\r\nconclusive facts in favour of the theory supported in the volume.\r\n\r\nIn America the continuity of the Glacial period has been maintained\r\nduring the past two years with important new evidence, among others\r\nby authorities of no less eminence and special experience in glacial\r\ninvestigations than Professor Dana,[A] Mr. Warren Upham,[B] and Professor\r\nEdward H. Williams, Jr.[C] Professor Williams's investigations on the\r\nattenuated border of the glacial deposits in the Lehigh, the most\r\nimportant upper tributary to the Delaware Valley, Pa., are of important\r\nsignificance, since the area which he so carefully studied lies wholly\r\nsouth of the terminal moraine of Lewis and Wright, and belongs to the\r\nportion of the older drift which Professors Chamberlin and Salisbury\r\nhave been most positive in assigning to the first Glacial epoch, which\r\nthey have maintained was separated from the second epoch by a length of\r\ntime sufficient for the streams to erode rock gorges in the Delaware and\r\nLehigh Rivers from two hundred to three hundred feet in depth.[D] But\r\nProfessor Williams has found that the rock gorges of the Lehigh, and\r\neven of its southern tributaries, had been worn down approximately to\r\nthe present depth of that of the Delaware before this earliest period of\r\nglaciation, and that the gorges were filled with the earliest glacial\r\n_débris_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: American Journal of Science, vol. xlvi, pp. 327, 330.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: American Journal of Science, vols, xlvi, pp. 114-121; xlvii,\r\npp. 358-365; American Geologist, vols, x, pp. 339-362, especially pp.\r\n361, 362; xiii, pp. 114, 278; Bulletin of the Geological Society of\r\nAmerica, vol. v, pp. 71-86, 87-100.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, vol. v, pp.\r\n13-16, 281-296; American Journal of Science, vol. xlvii, pp. 33-36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: See especially Chamberlin, in the American Journal of\r\nScience, vol. xlv, p. 192; Salisbury, in the American Geologist, vol. xi,\r\np. 18.]\r\n\r\nA similar relation of the glacial deposits of the attenuated border to\r\nthe preglacial erosion of the rock gorges of the Alleghany and upper\r\nOhio Rivers has been brought to light by the joint investigations of Mr.\r\nFrank Leverett and myself in western Pennsylvania, in the vicinity of\r\nWarren, Pa., where, in an area which was affected by only the earliest\r\nglaciation, glacial deposits are found filling the rock channels of\r\nold tributaries to the Alleghany to a depth of from one hundred and\r\nseventy to two hundred and fifty feet, and carrying the preglacial\r\nerosion at that point very closely, if not quite, down to the present\r\nrock bottoms of all the streams. This removes from Professor Chamberlin\r\na most important part of the evidence of a long interglacial period to\r\nwhich he had appealed; he having maintained[E] that \"the higher glacial\r\ngravels antedated those of the moraine-forming epoch by the measure of\r\nthe erosion of the channel through the old drift and the rock, whose mean\r\ndepth here is about three hundred feet, of which perhaps two hundred and\r\nfifty feet may be said to be rock,\" adding that the \"excavation that\r\nintervened between the two epochs in other portions of the Alleghany,\r\nMonongahela, and upper Ohio valleys is closely comparable with this.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Bulletin 58 of the United States Geological Survey, p. 35;\r\nAmerican Journal of Science, vol. xlv, p. 195.]\r\n\r\nThese observations of Mr. Leverett and myself seem to demonstrate the\r\nposition maintained in the volume (page 218), namely, that the inner\r\nprecipitous rock gorges of the upper Ohio and its tributaries are mainly\r\n_pre_glacial, rather than _inter_glacial. The only way in which Professor\r\nChamberlin can in any degree break the force of this discovery is by\r\nassuming that in preglacial times the present narrow rock gorges of the\r\nAlleghany and the Ohio were not continuous, but that (as indicated in\r\nthe present volume on page 206) the drainage of various portions of that\r\nregion was by northern outlets to the Lake Erie basin, leaving, on this\r\nsupposition, the _cols_ between two or three drainage areas to be lowered\r\nin glacial or interglacial time.\r\n\r\nOn the theory of continuity the erosion of these _cols_ would have been\r\nrapidly effected by the reversed drainage consequent upon the arrival\r\nof the ice-front at the southern shore of the Lake Erie basin. During\r\nall the time elapsing thereafter, until the ice had reached its southern\r\nlimit, the stream was also augmented by the annual partial melting of\r\nthe advancing glacier which was constantly bringing into the valley\r\nthe frozen precipitation of the far north. The distance is from thirty\r\nto seventy miles, so that a moderately slow advance of the ice at that\r\nstage would afford time for a great amount of erosion before sufficient\r\nnorthern gravel had reached the region to begin the filling of the\r\ngorge.[F]\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: See an elaborate discussion of the subject in its new phases\r\nby Chamberlin and Leverett, in the American Journal of Science, vol.\r\nxlvii, pp. 247-283.]\r\n\r\nMr. Leverett also presented an important paper before the Geological\r\nSociety of America at its meeting at Madison, Wis., in August, 1893,\r\nadducing evidence which, he thinks, goes to prove that the post-glacial\r\nerosion in the earlier drift in the region of Rock River, Ill., was\r\nseven or eight times as much as that in the later drift farther north;\r\nwhile Mr. Oscar H. Hershey arrives at nearly the same conclusions from\r\na study of the buried channels in northwestern Illinois.[G] But even\r\nif these estimates are approximately correct--which is by no means\r\ncertain--they only prove the length of the Glacial period, and not\r\nnecessarily its discontinuity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: American Geologist, vol. xii, p. 314f. Other important\r\nevidence to a similar effect is given by Mr. Leverett, in an article on\r\nThe Glacial Succession in Ohio, Journal of Geology, vol. i, pp. 129-146.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time it should be said that these investigations in western\r\nPennsylvania somewhat modify a portion of the discussion in the present\r\nvolume concerning the effects of the Cincinnati ice-dam. It now appears\r\nthat the full extent of the gravel terraces of glacial origin in the\r\nAlleghany River had not before been fully appreciated, since they are\r\nnearly continuous on the two-hundred-foot rock shelf, and are often\r\nas much as eighty feet thick. It seems probable, therefore, that the\r\nAlleghany and upper Ohio gorge was filled with glacial gravel to a depth\r\nof about two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet, as far down at\r\nleast as Wheeling, W. Va. If this was the case, it would obviate the\r\nnecessity of bringing in the Cincinnati ice-dam (as set forth in pages\r\n212-216) to account directly for all the phenomena in that region, except\r\nas this obstruction at Cincinnati would greatly facilitate the silting up\r\nof the gorge. The simple accumulation of glacial gravel in the Alleghany\r\ngorge would of itself dam up the Monongahela at Pittsburg, so as to\r\nproduce the results detailed by Professor White on page 215.[H]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: For a full discussion of these topics, see paper by\r\nProfessor B.

Bd. vi, Heft i.]\r\n\r\nWhen the first edition was issued, two years ago, there seemed to be\r\na general acceptance of all the facts detailed in it which directly\r\nconnected man with the Glacial period both in America and in Europe;\r\nand, indeed, I had studiously limited myself to such facts as had been\r\nso long and so fully before the public that there would seem to be no\r\nnecessity for going again into the details of evidence relating to them.\r\nIt appears, however, that this confidence was ill-founded; for the\r\npublication of the book seems to have been the signal for a confident\r\nchallenge, by Mr. W. H. Holmes, of all the American evidence, with\r\nintimations that the European also was very likely equally defective.[X]\r\nIn particular Mr. Holmes denies the conclusiveness of the evidence of\r\nglacial man adduced by Dr. Abbott and others at Trenton, N. J.; Dr.\r\nMetz, at Madisonville, Ohio; Mr. Mills, at Newcomerstown, Ohio; and Miss\r\nBabbitt, at Little Falls, Minn.\r\n\r\n[Footnote X: Journal of Geology, vol. i, pp. 15-37, 147-163; American\r\nGeologist, vol. xi, pp. 219-240.]\r\n\r\nThe sum of Mr. Holmes's effort amounts, however, to little more than\r\nthe statement that, with a limited amount of time and labour, neither he\r\nnor his assistants had been able to find any implements in undisturbed\r\ngravel in any of these places; and the suggestion of various ways in\r\nwhich he thinks it possible that the observers mentioned may have been\r\ndeceived as to the original position of the implements found. But, as\r\nhad been amply and repeatedly published,[Y] Professor J. D. Whitney,\r\nProfessor Lucien Carr, Professor N. S. Shaler, Professor F. W. Putnam,\r\nof Harvard University, besides Dr. C. C. Abbott, all expressly and with\r\nminute detail describe finding implements in the undisturbed gravel at\r\nTrenton, which no one denies to be of glacial origin. In the face of\r\nsuch testimony, which had been before the public and freely discussed\r\nfor several years, it is an arduous undertaking for Mr. Holmes to claim\r\nthat none of the implements have been found in place, because he and\r\nhis assistants (whose opportunities for observation had scarcely been\r\none twentieth part as great as those of the others) failed to find any.\r\nTo see how carefully the original observations were made, one has but\r\nto read the reports to Professor Putnam which have from time to time\r\nappeared in the Proceedings of the Peabody Museum and of the Boston\r\nSociety of Natural History,, and which are partially summed up in the\r\nthirty-second chapter of Dr. Abbott's volume on Primitive Industry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Y: Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History, vol.\r\nxxi, January 19, 1881; Report of the Peabody Museum, vol. ii, pp. 44-47;\r\nchap, xxxii of Abbott's Primitive Industry; American Geologist, vol. xi,\r\npp. 180-184.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the discovery at Newcomerstown, Mr. Holmes is peculiarly\r\nunfortunate in his efforts to present the facts, since, in endeavouring\r\nto represent the conditions under which the implement was found by Mr.\r\nMills, he has relied upon an imaginary drawing of his own, in which an\r\nutterly impossible state of things is pictured. The claim of Mr. Holmes\r\nin this case, as in the other, is that possibly the gravel in which the\r\nimplements were found had been disturbed. In some cases, as in Little\r\nFalls and at Madison ville, he thinks the implements may have worked down\r\nto a depth of several feet by the overturning of trees or by the decay\r\nof the tap-root of trees. A sufficient answer to these suggestions is,\r\nthat Mr. Holmes is able to find no instance in which the overturning of\r\ntrees has disturbed the soil to a depth of more than three or four feet,\r\nwhile some of the implements in these places had been found buried from\r\neight to sixteen feet. Even if, as Mr. Chamberlin suggests,[Z] fifty\r\ngenerations of trees have decayed on the spot since the retreat of the\r\nice, it is difficult to see how that would help the matter, since the\r\neffect could not be cumulative, and fifty upturnings of three or four\r\nfeet would not produce the results of one upturning of eight feet.\r\nMoreover, at Trenton, where the upturning of trees and the decaying of\r\ntap-roots would have been as likely as anywhere to bury implements,\r\nnone of those of flint or jasper (which occur upon the surface by tens\r\nof thousands) are buried more than a foot in depth; while the argillite\r\nimplements occur as low down as fifteen or twenty feet. This limitation\r\nof flint and jasper implements to the surface is conclusively shown not\r\nonly by Dr. Abbott's discoveries, but also by the extensive excavations\r\nat Trenton of Mr. Ernest Volk, whose collections formed so prominent\r\na part of Professor Putnam's Palæolithic exhibit at the Columbian\r\nExposition at Chicago. In the village sites explored by Mr. Volk,\r\nargillite was the exclusive material of the implements found in the lower\r\nstrata of gravel. Similar results are indicated by the excavations of Mr.\r\nH. C. Mercer at Point Pleasant, Pa., about twenty miles above Trenton,\r\nwhere, in the lower strata, the argillite specimens are sixty-one times\r\nmore numerous than the jasper are.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Z: American Geologist, vol. xi, p. 188.]\r\n\r\nTo discredit the discoveries at Trenton and Newcomerstown, Mr. Holmes\r\nrelies largely upon the theory that portions of gravel from the surface\r\nhad slid down to the bottom of the terrace, carrying implements with\r\nthem, and forming a talus, which, he thinks, Mr. Mills, Dr. Abbott,\r\nand the others have mistaken for undisturbed strata of gravel. In his\r\ndrawings Mr. Holmes has even represented the gravel at Newcomerstown\r\nas caving down into a talus without disturbing the strata to any great\r\nextent, and at the same time he speaks slightingly of the promise which I\r\nhad made to publish a photograph of the bank as it really was. In answer,\r\nit is sufficient to give, first, the drawing made at the time by Mr.\r\nMills, to show the general situation of the gravel bank at Newcomerstown,\r\nin which the implement figured on page 252 was found; and, secondly, an\r\nengraving from a photograph of the bank, taken by Mr. Mills after the\r\ndiscovery of the implement, but before the talus had obscured its face.\r\nThe implement was found by Mr. Mills with its point projecting from a\r\nfresh exposure of the terrace, just after a mass, loosened by his own\r\nefforts, had fallen away. The gravel is of such consistency that every\r\nsign of stratification disappears when it falls down, and there could be\r\nno occasion for a mistake even by an ordinary observer, while Mr. Mills\r\nwas a well-trained geologist and collector, making his notes upon the\r\nspot.[AA]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AA: The Popular Science Monthly, vol. xliii, pp. 29-39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Height of Terrace exposed, 25 feet. Palæolith was found\r\n14-3/4 feet from surface.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Terrace in Newcomerstown, showing where W. C. Mills found\r\nthe Palæolithic implement.]\r\n\r\nI had thought at first that Mr. Holmes had made out a better case against\r\nthe late Miss Babbitt's discoveries at Little Falls (referred to on\r\npage 254), but in the American Geologist for May, 1894, page 363, Mr.\r\nWarren Upham, after going over the evidence, expresses it as still his\r\nconviction that Mr. Holmes's criticism fails to shake the force of the\r\noriginal evidence, so that I do not see any reason for modifying any of\r\nthe statements made in the body of the book concerning the implements\r\nsupposed to have been found in glacial deposits. Yet if I had expected\r\nsuch an avalanche of criticism of the evidence as has been loosened, I\r\nshould at the time have fortified my statements by fuller references,\r\nand should possibly have somewhat enlarged the discussion. But this\r\nseemed then the less necessary, from the fact that Mr. McGee had, in most\r\nemphatic manner, indorsed nearly every item of the evidence adduced by\r\nme, and much more, in an article which appeared in The Popular Science\r\nMonthly four years before the publication of the volume (November, 1888).\r\nIn this article he had said:\r\n\r\n\"But it is in the aqueo-glacial gravels of the Delaware River at Trenton,\r\nwhich were laid down contemporaneously with the terminal moraine one\r\nhundred miles farther northward, and which have been so thoroughly\r\nstudied by Abbott, that the most conclusive proof of the existence of\r\nglacial man is found\" (p. 23). \"Excluding all doubtful cases, there\r\nremains a fairly consistent body of testimony indicating the existence of\r\na widely distributed human population upon the North. American continent\r\nduring the later Ice epoch\" (p. 24). \"However the doubtful cases may be\r\nneglected, the testimony is cumulative, parts of it are unimpeachable,\r\nand the proof of the existence of glacial man seems conclusive\" (p. 25).\r\n\r\nIn view of the grossly erroneous statements made by Mr. McGee concerning\r\nthe Nampa image (described on pages 298, 299), it is necessary for\r\nme to speak somewhat more fully of this important discovery. The\r\ndetails concerning the evidence were drawn out by me at length in two\r\ncommunications to the Boston Society of Natural History (referred to on\r\npage 297), which fill more than thirty pages of closely printed matter,\r\nwhile two or three years before the appearance of the volume the facts\r\nhad been widely published in the New York Independent, the Scientific\r\nAmerican, The Nation, Scribner's Magazine, and the Atlantic Monthly,\r\nand in Washington at a meeting of the Geological Society of America\r\nin 1890. In the second communication to the Boston Society of Natural\r\nHistory an account was given of a personal visit to the Snake River\r\nValley, largely for the purpose of further investigation of the evidence\r\nbrought to my notice by Mr. Charles Francis Adams, and of the conditions\r\nunder which the figurine was found. Among the most important results\r\nof this investigation was the discovery of numerous shells under the\r\nlava deposits, which Mr. Dall, of the United States Geological Survey,\r\nidentified for me as either post-Tertiary or late Pliocene; thus throwing\r\nthe superficial lava deposits of the region into the Quaternary period,\r\nand removing from the evidence the antecedent improbability which would\r\nbear so heavily against it if we were compelled to suppose that the\r\nlava of the Snake River region was all of Tertiary or even of early\r\nQuaternary age. Furthermore, the evidence of the occurrence of a great\r\n_débâcle_ in the Snake River Valley during the Glacial period, incident\r\nupon the bursting of the banks of Lake Bonneville, goes far to remove\r\nantecedent presumptions against the occurrence of human implements in\r\nsuch conditions as those existing at Nampa (see below, pp. 233-237).\r\n\r\nMr. McGee's misunderstanding of the evidence on one point is so gross,\r\nthat I must make special reference to it. He says[AB] that this image\r\n\"is alleged to have been pounded out of volcanic tuff by a heavy drill,\r\n... under a thick Tertiary lava bed.\" The statement of facts on page\r\n298 bears no resemblance to this representation. It is there stated\r\nthat there were but fifteen feet of lava, and that near the surface;\r\nthat below this there was nothing but alternating beds of clay and\r\nquicksand, and that the lava is post-Tertiary. The sand-pump I should\r\nperhaps have described more fully in the book, as I had already done in\r\nthe communication to the Boston Society of Natural History. It was a\r\ntube eight feet long, with a valve at the bottom three and a half inches\r\nin diameter on the inside. Through this it was the easiest thing in the\r\nworld for the object, which is only one inch and a half long, to be\r\nbrought up in the quicksand without injury.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AB: Literary Northwest, vol. ii, p. 275.]\r\n\r\nThe baseless assertions of Mr. McGee, involving the honesty of Messrs.\r\nKurtz and Duffes, are even less fortunate and far more reprehensible. \"It\r\nis a fact,\" says Mr. McGee, \"that one of the best-known geologists of the\r\nworld chanced to visit Nampa while the boring was in progress, and the\r\nfigurine and the pretty fiction were laid before him. He recognized the\r\nfigurine as a toy such as the neighbouring Indians give their children,\r\nand laughed at the story; whereupon the owner of the object enjoined\r\nsecrecy, pleading: 'Don't give me away; I've fooled a lot of fellows\r\nalready, and I'd like to fool some more.'\"[AC] This well-known geologist,\r\non being challenged by Professor Claypole[AD] to give \"a full, exact,\r\nand certified statement of the conversation\" above referred to, proved\r\nto be Major Powell, who responded with the following statement: \"In the\r\nfall of 1889 the writer visited Boise City, in Idaho [twenty miles from\r\nNampa]. While stopping at a hotel, some gentlemen called on him to show\r\nhim a figurine which they said they had found in sinking an artesian\r\nwell in the neighbourhood, at a depth, if I remember rightly, of more\r\nthan three hundred feet.... When this story was told the writer, he\r\nsimply jested with those who claimed to have found it. He had known the\r\nIndians that live in the neighbourhood, had seen their children play with\r\njust such figurines, and had no doubt that the little image had lately\r\nbelonged to some Indian child, and said the same. While stopping at the\r\nhotel different persons spoke about it, and it was always passed off as\r\na jest; and various comments were made about it by various people, some\r\nof them claiming that it had given them much sport, and that a good many\r\ntenderfeet had looked at it, and believed it to be genuine; and they\r\nseemed rather pleased that I had detected the hoax.\"[AE]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AC: American Anthropologist, vol. vi, p. 94: repeated by Mr.\r\nMcGee in the Literary Northwest, vol. ii, p. 276.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AD: The Popular Science Monthly, vol. xlii, p. 773.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AE: Ibid., vol. xliii, pp. 322, 323.]\r\n\r\nThus it appears that Major Powell has made no such statement, at least\r\nin public, as Mr. McGee attributes to him. It should be said, also, that\r\nMajor Powell's memory is very much at fault when he affirms that there\r\nis a close resemblance between this figurine and some of the children's\r\nplaythings among the Pocatello Indians. On the contrary, it would have\r\nbeen even more of a surprise to find it in the hands of these children\r\nthan to find it among the prehistoric deposits on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nTo most well-informed people it is sufficient to know that no less\r\nhigh authorities than Mr. Charles Francis Adams and Mr. G. M. Gumming,\r\nGeneral Manager for the Union Pacific line for that district, carefully\r\ninvestigated the evidence at the time of the discovery, and, knowing\r\nthe parties, were entirely satisfied with its sufficiency. It was\r\nalso subjected to careful examination by Professor F. W. Putnam, who\r\ndiscerned, in a deposit of an oxide of iron on various parts of the\r\nimage, indubitable evidence that it was a relic which had lain for a long\r\ntime in some such condition as was assigned to it in the bottom of the\r\nwell--all of which is detailed in the papers referred to below, on page\r\n297.\r\n\r\nFinally, the discovery, both in its character and conditions, is in so\r\nmany respects analogous to those made under Table Mountain, near Sonora,\r\nCal. (described on pages 294-297), that the evidence of one locality adds\r\ncumulative force to that of the other. The strata underneath the lava in\r\nwhich these objects were found are all indirectly, but pretty certainly,\r\nconnected with the Glacial period.[AF] No student of glacial archæology,\r\ntherefore, can hereafter afford to disregard these facts from the Pacific\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AF: See below, p. 349.]\r\n\r\nOberlin, Ohio, _June 2, 1894_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wide interest manifested in my treatise upon The Ice Age in North\r\nAmerica and its Bearing upon the Antiquity of Man (of which a third\r\nedition was issued a year ago), seemed to indicate the desirability of\r\nproviding for the public a smaller volume discussing the broader question\r\nof man's entire relation to the Glacial period in Europe as well as in\r\nAmerica. When the demand for such a volume became evident, I set about\r\npreparing for the task by spending, first, a season in special study\r\nof the lava-beds of the Pacific coast, whose relations to the Glacial\r\nperiod and to man's antiquity are of such great interest; and, secondly,\r\na summer in Europe, to enable me to compare the facts bearing upon the\r\nsubject on both continents.\r\n\r\nOf course, the chapters of the present volume relating to America cover\r\nmuch of the same ground gone over in the previous treatise; but the\r\nmatter has been entirely rewritten and very much condensed, so as to give\r\ndue proportions to all parts of the subject. It will interest some to\r\nknow that most of the new material in this volume was first wrought over\r\nin my second course of Lowell Institute Lectures, given in Boston during\r\nthe month of March last.\r\n\r\nI am under great obligations to Mr. Charles Francis Adams for his aid in\r\nprosecuting investigations upon the Pacific coast of America; and also to\r\nDr. H. W. Crosskey, of Birmingham, England, and to Mr. G. W. Lamplugh,\r\nof Bridlington, as well as to Mr. C. E. De Rance and Mr. Clement Reid,\r\nof the British Geological Survey, besides many others in England who\r\nhave facilitated my investigations; but pre-eminently to Prof. Percy F.\r\nKendall, of Stockport, who consented to prepare for me the portion of\r\nChapter VI which relates to the glacial phenomena of the British Isles. I\r\nhave no doubt of the general correctness of the views maintained by him,\r\nand little doubt, also, that his clear and forcible presentation of the\r\nfacts will bring about what is scarcely less than a revolution in the\r\nviews generally prevalent relating to the subject of which he treats.\r\n\r\nFor the glacial facts relating to France and Switzerland I am indebted\r\nlargely to M. Falsan's valuable compendium, La Période Glaciaire.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying, also, that I am under the deepest obligation\r\nto the works of Prof. James Geikie upon The Great Ice Age and upon\r\nPrehistoric Europe, and to the remarkable volume of the late Mr. James\r\nCroll upon Climate and Time, as well as to the recent comprehensive\r\ngeological treatises of Sir Archibald Geikie and Prof. Prestwich.\r\nFinally, I would express my gratitude for the great courtesy of Prof.\r\nFraipont, of Liége, in assisting me to an appreciation of the facts\r\nrelating to the late remarkable discovery of two entire skeletons of\r\nPaleolithic man in the grotto of Spy.\r\n\r\nComparative completeness is also given to the volume by the appendix on\r\nthe question of man's existence during the Tertiary period, prepared by\r\nthe competent hand of Prof. Henry W. Haynes, of Boston.\r\n\r\nI trust this brief treatise will be useful not only in _interesting_\r\nthe general public, but in giving a clear view of the present state of\r\nprogress in one department of the inquiries concerning man's antiquity.\r\nIf the conclusions reached are not as positive as could be wished, still\r\nit is both desirable and important to see what degree of indefiniteness\r\nrests upon the subject, in order that rash speculations may be avoided\r\nand future investigations directed in profitable lines.\r\n\r\nG.

That, at a comparatively recent date,\r\nthese glaciers extended far beyond their present limits, and that others\r\nexisted upon the highlands of Scotland and British America, and at one\r\ntime covered a large part of the British Isles, the whole of British\r\nAmerica, and a considerable area in the northern part of the United\r\nStates, are inferences drawn from phenomena which are open to every one's\r\nobservations. That man was in existence and occupied both Europe and\r\nAmerica during this great expansion of the northern glaciers is proved\r\nby evidence which is now beyond dispute. It is the object of the present\r\nvolume to make a concise presentation of the facts which have been\r\nrapidly accumulating during the past few years relating to the Glacial\r\nperiod and to its connection with human history.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the number and present extent of existing glaciers,\r\nit will be profitable, however, to devote a little attention to the\r\ndefinition of terms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Zermatt Glacier (Agassiz).]\r\n\r\nA _glacier_ is a mass of ice so situated and of such size as to have\r\nmotion in itself. The conditions determining the character and rate\r\nof this motion will come up for statement and discussion later. It is\r\nsufficient here to say that ice has a capacity of movement similar to\r\nthat possessed by such plastic substances as cold molasses, wax, tar, or\r\ncooling lava.\r\n\r\nThe limit of a glacier's _motion_ is determined by the forces which fix\r\nthe point at which its final melting takes place. This will therefore\r\ndepend upon both the warmth of the weather and upon the amount of ice.\r\nIf the ice is abundant, it will move farther into the region of warm\r\ntemperature than it will if it is limited in supply.\r\n\r\nUpon ascending a glacier far enough, one reaches a comparatively\r\nmotionless part corresponding to the lake out of which a river often\r\nflows. Technically this is called the _névé_.\r\n\r\n_Glacial ice_ is formed from snow where the annual fall is in excess\r\nof the melting power of the sun at that point. Through the influence\r\nof pressure, such as a boy applies to a snow-ball (but which in the\r\n_névé_-field arises from the weight of the accumulating mass), the lower\r\nstrata of the _névé_ are gradually transformed into ice. This process, is\r\nalso assisted by the moisture which percolates through the snowy mass,\r\nand which is furnished both by the melting of the surface snow and by\r\noccasional rains.\r\n\r\nThe division between the _névé_ and the glacier proper is not always\r\neasily determined. The beginnings of the glacial movement--that is, of\r\nthe movement of the ice-stream flowing out of the _névé_-field--are\r\nsomewhat like the beginnings of the movement of the water from a great\r\nlake into its outlet. The _névé_ is the reservoir from which the glacier\r\ngets both its supply of ice and the impulse which gives it its first\r\nmovement. There can not be a glacier without a _névé_-field, as there can\r\nnot be a river without a drainage basin. But there may be a _névé_-field\r\nwithout a glacier--that is, a basin may be partially filled with snow\r\nwhich never melts completely away, while the equilibrium of forces is\r\nsuch that the ice barely reaches to the outlet from which the tongue-like\r\nprojection (to which the name glacier would be applied) fails to emerge\r\nonly because of the lack of material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Illustrates the formation of veined structure by\r\npressure at the junction of two branches.]\r\n\r\nA glacier is characterised by both _veins_ and _fissures_. The veins\r\ngive it a banded or stratified appearance, blue alternating with\r\nlighter-coloured portions of ice. As these bands are not arranged with\r\nany apparent uniformity in the glacier, their explanation has given\r\nrise to much discussion. Sometimes the veins are horizontal, sometimes\r\nvertical, and at other times at an angle with the line of motion. On\r\nclose investigation, however, it is found that the veins are always\r\nat right angles to the line of greatest pressure. This leads to the\r\nconclusion that pressure is the cause of the banded structure. The\r\nblue strata in the ice are those from which the particles of air have\r\nbeen expelled by pressure; the lighter portions are those in which the\r\nparticles are less thoroughly compacted. Snow is but pulverized ice, and\r\ndiffers in colour from the compact mass for the same reason that almost\r\nall rocks and minerals change their colour when ground into a powder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 3, 4.--Illustrate the formation of marginal fissures\r\nand veins.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--_c_, _c_, show fissures and seracs where the\r\nglacier moves down the steeper portion of its incline; _s_, _s_, show the\r\nvertical structure produced by pressure on the gentler slopes.]\r\n\r\nThe _fissures_, which, when of large size, are called _crevasses_, are\r\nformed in those portions of a glacier where, from some cause, the ice\r\nis subjected to slight tension. This occurs especially where, through\r\nirregularities in the bottom, the slope of the descent is increased. The\r\nice, then, instead of moving in a continuous stream at the top, cracks\r\nopen along the line of tension, and wedge-shaped fissures are formed\r\nextending from the top down to a greater or less distance, according to\r\nthe degree of tension. Usually, however, the ice remains continuous in\r\nthe lower strata, and when the slope is diminished the pressure reunites\r\nthe faces of the fissure, and the surface becomes again comparatively\r\nsmooth. Where there are extensive areas of tension, the surface of the\r\nice sometimes becomes exceedingly broken, presenting a tangled mass of\r\ntowers, domes, and pinnacles of ice called _seracs_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Section across Glacial Valley, showing old\r\nLateral Moraines.]\r\n\r\nLike running water, moving ice is a powerful agent in _transporting_\r\nrocks and earthy _débris_ of all grades of fineness; but, owing to the\r\ndifferent consistencies of ice and water, there are great differences in\r\nthe mode and result of transportation by them. While water can hold in\r\nsuspension only the very finest material, ice can bear upon its surface\r\nrocks of the greatest magnitude, and can roll or shove along under it\r\nboulders and pebbles which would be Unaffected except by torrential\r\ncurrents of water. We find, therefore, a great amount of earthy material\r\nof all sizes upon the top of a glacier, which has reached it very much as\r\n_débris_ reaches the bed of a river, namely, by falling down upon it from\r\noverhanging cliffs, or by land-slides of greater or less extent. Such\r\nmaterial coming into a river would either disappear beneath its surface,\r\nor would form a line of _débris_ along the banks; in both cases awaiting\r\nthe gradual erosion and transportation which running water is able to\r\neffect. But, in case of a glacier, the material rests upon the surface of\r\nthe ice, and at once begins to partake of its motion, while successive\r\naccessions of material keep up the supply at any one point, so as to form\r\na train of boulders and other _débris_, extending below the point as far\r\nas the glacial motion continues.\r\n\r\nSuch a line of _débris_ is called a _moraine_. When it forms along the\r\nedge of the ice, it is called a _lateral_ moraine. It is easy to see\r\nthat, where glaciers come out from two valleys which are tributary to\r\na larger valley, their inner sides must coalesce below the separating\r\npromontory, and the two lateral moraines will become united and will\r\nmove onward in the middle of the surface of the glacier. Such lines of\r\n_débris_ are called _medial_ moraines. These are characteristic of all\r\nextensive glaciers formed by the union of tributaries. There is no limit\r\nto the number of medial moraines, except in the number of tributaries.\r\n\r\nA medial moraine, when of sufficient thickness, protects the ice\r\nunderneath it from melting; so that the moraine will often appear to\r\nbe much larger than it really is: what seems to be a ridge of earthy\r\nmaterial being in reality a long ridge of ice, thinly covered with earthy\r\n_débris_, sliding down the slanting sides as the ice slowly wastes away\r\nLarge blocks of stone in the same manner protect the ice from melting\r\nunderneath, and are found standing on pedestals of ice, often several\r\nfeet in height. An interesting feature of these blocks is that, when the\r\npedestal fails, the block uniformly falls towards the sun, since that is\r\nthe side on which the melting has proceeded most rapidly.\r\n\r\nIf the meteorological forces are so balanced that the foot of a glacier\r\nremains at the same place for any great length of time, there must be a\r\ngreat accumulation of earthy _débris_ at the stationary point, since the\r\nmotion of the ice is constantly bearing its lines of lateral and medial\r\nmoraine downwards to be deposited, year by year, at the melting line\r\nalong the front.\r\n\r\nSuch accumulations are called _terminal_ moraines, and the process of\r\ntheir formation may be seen at the foot of almost any large glacier. The\r\npile of material thus confusedly heaped up in front of some of the larger\r\nglaciers of the world is enormous.\r\n\r\nThe melting away of the lower part of a glacier gives rise also to\r\nseveral other characteristic phenomena. Where the foot of a glacier\r\nchances to be on comparatively level land, the terminal moraine often\r\ncovers a great extent of ice, and protects it from melting for an\r\nindefinite period of time. When the ice finally melts away and removes\r\nthe support from the overlying morainic _débris_, this settles down in\r\na very irregular manner, leaving enclosed depressions to which there\r\nis no natural outlet. These depressions, from their resemblance to a\r\nfamiliar domestic utensil, are technically known as _kettle-holes_. The\r\nterminal moraines of ancient glaciers may often be traced by the relative\r\nabundance of these kettle-holes.\r\n\r\nThe streams of water arising both from the rainfall and from the melting\r\nof the ice also produce a peculiar effect about the foot of an extensive\r\nglacier. Sometimes these streams cut long, open channels near the end\r\nof the glacier, and sweep into it vast quantities of morainic material,\r\nwhich is pushed along by the torrential current, and, after being\r\nabraded, rolled, and sorted, is deposited in a delta about its mouth, or\r\nleft stranded in long lines between the ice-walls which have determined\r\nits course. At other times the stream has disappeared far back in the\r\nglacier, and plunged into a crevasse (technically called a _moulin_),\r\nwhence it flows onwards as a subglacial stream. But in this case the\r\ndeposits might closely resemble those of the previous description. In\r\nboth cases, when the ice has finally melted away, peculiar ridge-like\r\ndeposits of sorted material remain, to mark the temporary line of\r\ndrainage. These exist abundantly in most regions which have been covered\r\nwith glacial ice, and are referred to in Scotland as _kames_, in Ireland\r\nas _eskers_, and in Sweden as _osars_. In this volume we shall call them\r\n_kames_, and the deltas spread out in front of them will be referred to\r\nas _kame-plains_.\r\n\r\nWith this preliminary description of glacial phenomena, we will proceed\r\nto give, first, a brief enumeration and description of the ice-fields\r\nwhich are still existing in the world; second, the evidences of the\r\nformer existence of far more extensive ice-fields; and, third, the\r\nrelation of the Glacial period to some of the vicissitudes which have\r\nattended the life of man in the world.\r\n\r\nThe geological period of which we shall treat is variously designated by\r\ndifferent writers. By some it is simply called the \"post-Tertiary,\" or\r\n\"Quaternary\"; by others the term \"post-Pliocene\" is used, to indicate\r\nmore sharply its distinction from the latter portion of the Tertiary\r\nperiod; by others this nicety of distinction is expressed by the term\r\n\"Pleistocene.\" But, since the whole epoch was peculiarly characterised\r\nby the presence of glaciers, which have not even yet wholly disappeared,\r\nwe may properly refer to it altogether under the descriptive name of\r\n\"Glacial\" period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEXISTING GLACIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Europe._--Our specific account of existing glaciers naturally begins\r\nwith those of the Alps, where Hugi, Charpentier, Agassiz, Forbes, and\r\nGuyot, before the middle of this century, first brought clearly to light\r\nthe reality and nature of glacial motion.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Heim, of Zürich, the total area covered by the\r\nglaciers and ice-fields of the Alps is upwards of three thousand square\r\nkilometres (about eleven hundred square miles). The Swiss Alps alone\r\ncontain nearly two-thirds of this area. Professor Heim enumerates 1,155\r\ndistinct glaciers in the region. Of these, 144 are in France, 78 in\r\nItaly, 471 in Switzerland, and 462 in Austria.\r\n\r\nDesor describes fourteen principal glacial districts in the Alps, the\r\nwesternmost of which is that of Mont Pelvoux, in Dauphiny, and the\r\neasternmost that in the vicinity of the Gross Glockner, in Carinthia. The\r\nmost important of the Alpine systems are those which are grouped around\r\nMont Blanc, Monte Rosa, and the Finsteraarhorn, the two former peaks\r\nbeing upwards of fifteen thousand feet in height, and the latter upwards\r\nof fourteen thousand. The area covered by glaciers and snow-fields\r\nin the Bernese Oberland, of which Finsteraarhorn is the culminating\r\npoint, is about three hundred and fifty square kilometres (a hundred\r\nsquare miles), and contains the Aletsch Glacier, which is the longest\r\nin Europe, extending twenty-one kilometres (about fourteen miles) from\r\nthe _névé_-field to its foot. The Mer de Glace, which descends from Mont\r\nBlanc to the valley of Chamounix, has a length of about eight miles\r\nbelow the _névé_-field. In all, there are estimated to be twenty-four\r\nglaciers in the Alps which are upwards of four miles long, and six which\r\nare upwards of eight miles in length. The principal of these are the Mer\r\nde Glace, of Chamounix, on Mont Blanc; the Gorner Glacier, near Zermatt,\r\non Monte Rosa; the lower glacier of the Aar, in the Bernese Oberland;\r\nand the Aletsch Glacier and Glacier of the Rhône, in Vallais; and the\r\nPasterzen, in Carinthia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Mount Blanc Glacier Region: _m_, Mer de Glace;\r\n_g_, Du Géant; _l_, Leschaux; _t_, Taléfre; _B_, Bionassay; _b_, Bosson.]\r\n\r\nThese glaciers adjust themselves to the width of the valleys down which\r\nthey flow, in some places being a mile or more in width, and at others\r\ncontracting into much narrower compass. The greatest depth which Agassiz\r\nwas able directly to measure in the Aar Glacier was two hundred and\r\nsixty metres (five hundred and twenty-eight feet), but at another point\r\nthe depth was estimated by him to be four hundred and sixty metres (or\r\nfifteen hundred and eighty-four feet).\r\n\r\nThe glaciers of the Alps are mostly confined to the northern side and\r\nto the higher portions of the mountain-chain, none of them descending\r\nbelow the level of four thousand feet, and all of them varying slightly\r\nin extent, from year to year, according as there are changes in the\r\ntemperature and in the amount of snow-fall.\r\n\r\nThe Pyrenees, also, still maintain a glacial system, but it is of\r\ninsignificant importance. This is partly because the altitude is much\r\nless than that of the Alps, the culminating point being scarcely more\r\nthan eleven thousand feet in height. Doubtless, also, it is partly due to\r\nthe narrowness of the range, which does not provide gathering-places for\r\nthe snow sufficiently extensive to produce large glaciers. The snow-fall\r\nalso is less upon the Pyrenees than upon the Alps. As a consequence of\r\nall these conditions, the glaciers of the Pyrenees are scarcely more\r\nthan stationary _névé_-fields lingering upon the north side of the range.\r\nThe largest of these is near Bagnères de Luchon, and sends down a short,\r\nriver-like glacier.\r\n\r\nIn Scandinavia the height of the mountains is also much less than that of\r\nthe Alps, but the moister climate and the more northern latitude favours\r\nthe growth of glaciers at a much lower level North of the sixty-second\r\ndegree of latitude, the plateaus over five thousand feet above the sea\r\npretty generally are gathering-places for glaciers. From the Justedal a\r\nsnow-field, covering five hundred and eighty square miles, in latitude\r\n62°, twenty-four glaciers push outwards towards the German Sea, the\r\nlargest of which is five miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide.\r\nThe Fondalen snow-field, between latitudes 66° and 67°, covers an\r\narea about equal to that of the Justedal; but, on account of its more\r\nnorthern position, its glaciers descend through the valleys quite to the\r\nocean-level. The Folgofon snow-field is still farther south, but, though\r\noccupying an area of only one hundred square miles, it sends down as many\r\nas three glaciers to the sea-level. The total area of the Scandinavian\r\nsnow-fields is about five thousand square miles.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden Dr. Svenonius estimates that there are, between latitudes 67°\r\nand 68-1/2°, twenty distinct groups of glaciers, covering an area of four\r\nhundred square kilometres (one hundred and forty-four square miles), and\r\nhe numbers upwards of one hundred distinct glaciers of small size.\r\n\r\nAs is to be expected, the large islands in the Polar Sea north of Europe\r\nand Asia are, to a great extent, covered with _névé_-fields, and numerous\r\nglaciers push out from them to the sea in all directions, discharging\r\ntheir surplus ice as bergs, which float away and cumber the waters with\r\ntheir presence in many distant places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--The Svartisen Glacier on the west coast of\r\nNorway, just within the Arctic circle, at the head of a fiord ten miles\r\nfrom the ocean. The foot of the Glacier is one mile wide, and a quarter\r\nof a mile back from the water. Terminal moraine in front. (Photographed\r\nby Dr. L. C. Warner.)]\r\n\r\nThe island of Spitzbergen, in latitude 76° to 81°, is favourably situated\r\nfor the production of glaciers, by reason both of its high northern\r\nlatitude, and of its relation to the Gulf Stream, which conveys around\r\nto it an excessive amount of moisture, thus ensuring an exceptionally\r\nlarge snow-fall over the island. The mountainous character of the island\r\nalso favours the concentration of the ice-movement into glaciers of vast\r\nsize and power. Still, even here, much of the land is free from snow and\r\nice in summer. But upon the northern portion of the island there is an\r\nextensive table-land, upwards of two thousand feet above the sea, over\r\nwhich the ice-field is continuous. Four great glaciers here descend to\r\ntide-water in Magdalena Bay. The largest of these presents at the front a\r\nwall of ice seven thousand feet across and three hundred feet high; but,\r\nas the depth of the water is not great, few icebergs of large size break\r\noff and float away from it.\r\n\r\nNova Zembla, though not in quite so high latitude, has a lower mean\r\ntemperature upon the coasts than Spitzbergen. Owing to the absence of\r\nhigh lands and mountains, however, it is not covered with perpetual snow,\r\nmuch less with glacial ice, but its level portions are \"carpeted with\r\ngrasses and flowers,\" and sustain extensive forests of stunted trees.\r\n\r\nFranz-Josef Land, to the north of Nova Zembla, both contains high\r\nmountains and supports glaciers of great size. Mr. Payer conducted a\r\nsledge party into this land in 1874, and reported that a precipitous wall\r\nof glacial ice, \"of more than a hundred feet in height, formed the usual\r\nedge of the coast.\" But the motion of the ice is very slow, and the ice\r\ncoarse-grained in structure, and it bears a small amount only of morainic\r\nmaterial. So low is here the line of perpetual snow, that the smaller\r\nislands \"are covered with caps of ice, so that a cross-section would\r\nexhibit a regular flat segment of ice.\" It is interesting to note, also,\r\nthat \"many ice-streams, descending from the high _névé_ plateau, spread\r\nthemselves out over the mountain-slopes,\" and are not, as in the Alps,\r\nconfined to definite valleys.\r\n\r\nIceland seems to have been properly named, since a single one of the\r\nsnow-fields--that of Vatnajoküll, with an extreme elevation of only six\r\nthousand feet--is estimated by Helland to cover one hundred and fifty\r\nNorwegian square miles (about seven thousand English square miles), while\r\nfive other ice-fields (the Langjoküll, the Hofsjoküll, the Myrdalsjoküll,\r\nthe Drangajoküll, and the Glamujoküll) have a combined area of ninety-two\r\nNorwegian or about four thousand five hundred English square miles. The\r\nglaciers are supposed by Whitney to have been rapidly advancing for some\r\ntime past.\r\n\r\n_In Asia._--Notwithstanding its lofty mountains and its great extent\r\nof territory lying in high latitudes, glaciers are for two reasons\r\nrelatively infrequent: 1. The land in the more northern latitudes is low.\r\n2. The dryness of the atmosphere in the interior of the continent is such\r\nthat it unduly limits the snow-fall. Long before they reach the central\r\nplateau of Asia, the currents of air which sweep over the continent from\r\nthe Indian Ocean have parted with their burdens of moisture, having left\r\nthem in a snowy mantle upon the southern flanks of the Himalayas. As a\r\nresult, we have the extensive deserts of the interior, where, on account\r\nof the clear atmosphere, there is not snow enough to resist continuously\r\nthe intense activity of the unobstructed rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their high latitude and considerable elevation above the\r\nsea-level, glaciers are absent from the Ural Mountains, for the range is\r\ntoo narrow to afford _névé_-fields of sufficient size to produce glaciers\r\nof large extent.\r\n\r\nThe Caucasus Mountains present more favourable conditions, and for a\r\ndistance of one hundred and twenty miles near their central portion\r\nhave an average height of 12,000 feet, with individual peaks rising to\r\na height of 16,000 feet or more; but, owing to their low latitude, the\r\nline of perpetual snow scarcely reaches down to the 11,000-foot level. So\r\ngreat are the snow-fields, however, above this height that many glaciers\r\npush their way down through the narrow mountain-gorges as far as the\r\n6,000-foot level.\r\n\r\nThe Himalaya Mountains present many favourable conditions for the\r\ndevelopment of glaciers of large size. The range is of great extent and\r\nheight, thus affording ample gathering-places for the snows, while the\r\nrelation of the mountains to the moisture-laden winds from the Indian\r\nOcean is such that they enjoy the first harvest of the clouds where\r\nthe interior of Asia gets only the gleanings. As is to be expected,\r\ntherefore, all the great rivers which course through the plains of\r\nHindustan have their rise in large glaciers far up towards the summits of\r\nthe northern mountains. The Indus and the Ganges are both glacial streams\r\nin their origin, as are their larger tributary branches--the Basha, the\r\nShigar, and the Sutlej. Many of the glaciers in the higher levels of\r\nthe Himalaya Mountains where these streams rise have a length of from\r\ntwenty-five to forty miles, and some of them are as much as a mile and\r\na half in width and extend for a long distance, with an inclination as\r\nsmall as one degree and a half or one hundred and thirty-eight feet to a\r\nmile.\r\n\r\nIn the Mustagh range of the western Himalayas there are two adjoining\r\nglaciers whose united length is sixty-five miles, and another not far\r\naway which is twenty-one miles long and from one to two miles wide in its\r\nupper portion. Its lower portion terminates at an altitude of 16,000 feet\r\nabove tide, where it is three miles wide and two hundred and fifty feet\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n_Oceanica._---Passing eastward to the islands of the Pacific Ocean, New\r\nZealand is the only one capable of supporting glaciers. Their existence\r\non this island seems the more remarkable because of its low latitude\r\n(42° to 45°); but a grand range of mountains rises abruptly from the\r\nwater on the western coast of the southern island, culminating in Mount\r\nCook, 13,000 feet above the sea, and extending for a distance of about\r\none hundred miles. The extent and height of this chain, coupled with\r\nthe moisture of the winds, which sweep without obstruction over so\r\nmany leagues of the tropical Pacific, are specially favourable to the\r\nproduction of ice-fields of great extent. Consequently we find glaciers\r\nin abundance, some of which are not inferior in extent to the larger ones\r\nof the Alps. The Tasman Glacier, described by Haas, is ten miles long\r\nand nearly two miles broad at its termination, \"the lower portion for a\r\ndistance of three miles being covered with morainic _detritus_.\" The\r\nMueller Glacier is about seven miles long and one mile broad in its lower\r\nportion.\r\n\r\n_South America._--In America, existing glaciers are chiefly confined to\r\nthree principal centres, namely, to the Andes, south of the equator; to\r\nthe Cordilleras, north of central California; and to Greenland.\r\n\r\nIn South America, however, the high mountains of Ecuador sustain a few\r\nglaciers above the twelve-thousand-foot level. The largest of these are\r\nupon the eastern slope of the mountains, giving rise to some of the\r\nbranches of the Amazon--indeed, on the flanks of Cotopaxi, Chimborazo,\r\nand Illinissa there are some glaciers in close proximity to the equator\r\nwhich are fairly comparable in size to those of the Alps.\r\n\r\nIn Chili, at about latitude 35°, glaciers begin to appear at lower\r\nlevels, descending beyond the six-thousand-foot line, while south of this\r\nboth the increasing moisture of the winds and the decreasing average\r\ntemperature favour the increase of ice-fields and glaciers. Consequently,\r\nas Darwin long ago observed, the line of perpetual snow here descends to\r\nan increasingly lower level, and glaciers extend down farther and farther\r\ntowards the sea, until, in Tierra del Fuego, at about latitude 45°, they\r\nbegin to discharge their frozen contents directly into the tidal inlets.\r\nDarwin's party surveyed a glacier entering the Gulf of Penas in latitude\r\n46° 50', which was fifteen miles long, and, in one part, seven broad. At\r\nEyre's Sound, also, in about latitude 48°, they found immense glaciers\r\ncoming clown to the sea and discharging icebergs of great size, one of\r\nwhich, as they encountered it floating outwards, was estimated to be \"_at\r\nleast_ one hundred and sixty-eight feet in total height.\"\r\n\r\nIn Tierra del Fuego, where the mountains are only from three thousand\r\nto four thousand feet in height and in latitude less than 55°, Darwin\r\nreports that \"every valley is filled with streams of ice descending to\r\nthe sea-coast,\" and that the inlets penetrated by his party presented\r\nminiature likenesses of the polar sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Floating berg, showing the proportions above and\r\nunder the water. About seven feet under water to one above.]\r\n\r\n_Antarctic Continent._--Of the so-called Antarctic Continent little is\r\nknown; but icebergs of great size are frequently encountered up to 58°\r\nsouth latitude, in the direction of Cape Horn, and as far as latitude\r\n33° in the direction of Cape of Good Hope. Nearly all that is known\r\nabout this continent was discovered by Sir J. C. Ross during the period\r\nextending from 1839 to 1843, when, between the parallels of 70° and 78°\r\nsouth latitude, he encountered in his explorations a precipitous mountain\r\ncoast, rising from seven thousand to ten thousand feet above tide.\r\nThrough the valleys intervening between the mountain-ranges huge glaciers\r\ndescended, and \"projected in many places several miles into the sea and\r\nterminated in lofty, perpendicular cliffs. In a few places the rocks\r\nbroke through their icy covering, by which alone we could be assured that\r\nland formed the nucleus of this, to appearance, enormous iceberg.\"[AG]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AG: Quoted by Whitney in Climatic Changes, p. 314.]\r\n\r\nAgain, speaking of the region in the vicinity of the lofty volcanoes\r\nTerror and Erebus, between ten thousand and twelve thousand feet high,\r\nthe same navigator says:\r\n\r\n\"We perceived a low, white line extending from its extreme eastern\r\npoint, as far as the eye could discern, to the eastward. It presented\r\nan extraordinary appearance, gradually increasing in height as we got\r\nnearer to it, and proving at length to be a perpendicular cliff of ice,\r\nbetween one hundred and fifty and two hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, perfectly flat and level at the top, and without any fissures\r\nor promontories on its even, seaward face. What was beyond it we could\r\nnot imagine; for, being much higher than our mast-head, we could not\r\nsee anything except the summit of a lofty range of mountains extending\r\nto the southward as far as the seventy-ninth degree of latitude. These\r\nmountains, being the southernmost land hitherto discovered, I felt\r\ngreat satisfaction in naming after Sir Edward Parry.... Whether Parry\r\nMountains again take an easterly trending and form the base to which this\r\nextraordinary mass of ice is attached, must be left for future navigators\r\nto determine. If there be land to the southward it must be very remote,\r\nor of much less elevation than any other part of the coast we have seen,\r\nor it would have appeared above the barrier.\"\r\n\r\nThis ice-cliff or barrier was followed by Captain Ross as far as 198°\r\nwest longitude, and found to preserve very much the same character during\r\nthe whole of that distance. On the lithographic view of this great\r\nice-sheet given in Ross's work it is described as \"part of the South\r\nPolar Barrier, one hundred and eighty feet above the sea-level, one\r\nthousand feet thick, and four hundred and fifty miles in length.\"\r\n\r\nA similar vertical wall of ice was seen by D'Urville, off the coast of\r\nAdelie Land. He thus describes it: \"Its appearance was astonishing. We\r\nperceived a cliff having a uniform elevation of from one hundred to one\r\nhundred and fifty feet, forming a long line extending off to the west....\r\nThus for more than twelve hours we had followed this wall of ice, and\r\nfound its sides everywhere perfectly vertical and its summit horizontal.\r\nNot the smallest irregularity, not the most inconsiderable elevation,\r\nbroke its uniformity for the twenty leagues of distance which we followed\r\nit during the day, although we passed it occasionally at a distance of\r\nonly two or three miles, so that we could make out with ease its smallest\r\nirregularities. Some large pieces of ice were lying along the side of\r\nthis frozen coast; but, on the whole, there was open sea in the offing.\"\r\n[AH]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AH: Whitney's Climatic Changes, pp. 315, 316.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Iceberg in the Antarctic Ocean.]\r\n\r\n_North America._--In North America living glaciers begin to appear in\r\nthe Sierra Nevada Mountains, in the vicinity of the Yosemite Park, in\r\ncentral California. Here the conditions necessary for the production\r\nof glaciers are favourable, namely, a high altitude, snow-fields of\r\nconsiderable extent, and unobstructed exposure to the moisture-laden\r\ncurrents of air from the Pacific Ocean. Sixteen glaciers of small size\r\nhave been noted among the summits to the east of the Yosemite; but none\r\nof them descend much below the eleven-thousand-foot line, and none of\r\nthem are over a mile in length. Indeed, they are so small, and their\r\nmotion is so slight, that it is a question whether or not they are to be\r\nclassed with true glaciers.\r\n\r\nOwing to the comparatively low elevation of the Sierra Nevada north of\r\nTuolumne County, California, no other living glaciers are found until\r\nreaching Mount Shasta, in the extreme northern part of the State. This\r\nis a volcanic peak, rising fourteen thousand five hundred feet above the\r\nsea, and having no peaks within forty miles of it as high as ten thousand\r\nfeet; yet so abundant is the snow-fall that as many as five glaciers are\r\nfound upon its northern side, some of them being as much as three miles\r\nlong and extending as low down as the eight-thousand-foot level. Upon the\r\nsouthern side glaciers are so completely absent that Professor Whitney\r\nascended the mountain and remained in perfect ignorance of its glacial\r\nsystem. In 1870 Mr. Clarence King first discovered and described them on\r\nthe northern side.\r\n\r\nNorth of California glaciers characterise the Cascade Range in increasing\r\nnumbers all the way to the Alaskan Peninsula. They are to be found upon\r\nDiamond Peak, the Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson, and Mount Hood, in\r\nOregon, and appear in still larger proportions upon the flanks of Mount\r\nRainier (or Tacoma) and Mount Baker, in the State of Washington. The\r\nglacier at the head of the White River Valley is upon the north side of\r\nRainier, and is the largest one upon that mountain, reaching down to\r\nwithin five thousand feet of the sea-level, and being ten miles or more\r\nin length. All the streams which descend the valleys upon this mountain\r\nare charged with the milky-coloured water which betrays their glacial\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Map of Southeastern Alaska. The arrow-points\r\nmark glaciers.]\r\n\r\nIn British Columbia, Glacier Station, upon the Canadian Pacific Railroad,\r\nin the Selkirk Mountains, is within half a mile of the handsome\r\nIllicilliwaet Glacier, while others of larger size are found at no great\r\ndistance. The interior farther north is unexplored to so great an extent\r\nthat little can be definitely said concerning its glacial phenomena. The\r\ncoast of British Columbia is penetrated by numerous fiords, each of which\r\nreceives the drainage of a decaying glacier; but none are in sight of the\r\ntourist-steamers which thread their way through the intricate network of\r\nchannels characterising this coast, until the Alaskan boundary is crossed\r\nand the mouth of the Stickeen River is passed.\r\n\r\nA few miles up from the mouth of the Stickeen, however, glaciers of\r\nlarge size come down to the vicinity of the river, both from the north\r\nand from the south, and the attention of tourists is always attracted\r\nby the abundant glacial sediment borne into the tide-water by the river\r\nitself and discolouring the surface for a long distance beyond the\r\noutlet. Northward from this point the tourist is rarely out of sight of\r\nice-fields. The Auk and Patterson Glaciers are the first to come into\r\nview, but they do not descend to the water-level. On nearing Holcomb\r\nBay, however, small icebergs begin to appear, heralding the first of the\r\nglaciers which descend beyond the water's edge. Taku Inlet, a little\r\nfarther north, presents glaciers of great size coming down to the\r\nsea-level, while the whole length of Lynn Canal, from Juneau to Chilkat,\r\na distance of eighty miles, is dotted on both sides by conspicuous\r\nglaciers and ice-fields.\r\n\r\nThe Davidson Glacier, near the head of the canal, is one of the most\r\ninteresting for purposes of study. It comes down from an unknown\r\ndistance in the western interior, bearing two marked medial moraines upon\r\nits surface. On nearing tide-level, the valley through which it flows is\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile in width; but, after emerging from the\r\nconfinement of the valley, the ice spreads out over a fan-shaped area\r\nuntil the width of its front is nearly three miles. The supply of ice\r\nnot being sufficient to push the front of the glacier into deep water,\r\nequilibrium between the forces of heat and cold is established near the\r\nwater's edge. Here, as from year to year the ice melts and deposits its\r\nburdens of earthy _débris_, it has piled up a terminal moraine which\r\nrises from two hundred to three hundred feet in height, and is now\r\ncovered with evergreen trees of considerable size. From Chilkat, at the\r\nhead of Lynn Canal, to the sources of the Yukon River, the distance is\r\nonly thirty-five miles, but the intervening mountain-chain is several\r\nthousand feet in height and bears numerous glaciers upon its seaward side.\r\n\r\nAbout forty miles west of Lynn Canal, and separated from it by a range\r\nof mountains of moderate height, is Glacier Bay, at the head of one of\r\nwhose inlets is the Muir Glacier, which forms the chief attraction for\r\nthe great number of tourists that now visit the coast of southeastern\r\nAlaska during the summer season. This glacier meets tide-water in\r\nlatitude 58° 50', and longitude 136° 40' west of Greenwich. It received\r\nits name from Mr. John Muir, who, in company with Rev. Mr. Young, made\r\na tour of the bay and discovered the glacier in 1879. It was soon found\r\nthat the bay could be safely navigated by vessels of large size, and from\r\nthat time on tourists in increasing number have been attracted to the\r\nregion. Commodious steamers now regularly run close up to the ice-front,\r\nand lie-to for several hours, so that the passengers may witness the\r\n\"calving\" of icebergs, and may climb upon the sides of the icy stream\r\nand look into its deep crevasses and out upon its corrugated and broken\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Map of Glacier Bay. Alaska, and its\r\nsurroundings. Arrow-points indicate glaciated area.]\r\n\r\nThe first persons who found it in their way to pay more than a tourist's\r\nvisit to this interesting object were Rev. J. L. Patton, Mr. Prentiss\r\nBaldwin, and myself, who spent the entire month of August, 1886, encamped\r\nat the foot of the glacier, conducting such observations upon it as\r\nweather and equipment permitted. From that time till the summer of 1890\r\nno one else stopped off from the tourist steamers to bestow any special\r\nstudy upon it. But during this latter season Mr. Muir returned to the\r\nscene of his discovered wonder, and spent some weeks in exploring the\r\ninterior of the great ice-field. During the same season, also, Professors\r\nH. F. Reid and H. Cushing, with a well-equipped party of young men,\r\nspent two months or more in the same field, conducting observations and\r\nexperiments, of various kinds, relating to the extent, the motion, and\r\nthe general behaviour of the vast mass of moving ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Shows central part of the front of Muir Glacier\r\none half mile distant. Near the lower left hand corner the ice is seen\r\none mile distant resting for about one half mile on gravel which it had\r\noverrun. The ice is now retreating in the channel. (From photograph.)]\r\n\r\nThe main body of the Muir Glacier occupies a vast amphitheatre, with\r\ndiameters ranging from thirty to forty miles, and covers an area of about\r\none thousand square miles. From one of the low mountains near its mouth I\r\ncould count twenty-six tributary glaciers which came together and became\r\nconfluent in the main stream of ice. Nine medial moraines marked the\r\ncontinued course of as many main branches, which becoming united formed\r\nthe grand trunk of the glacier. Numerous rocky eminences also projected\r\nabove the surface of the ice, like islands in the sea, corresponding to\r\nwhat are called \"_nunataks_\" in Greenland. The force of the ice against\r\nthe upper side of these rocky prominences is such as to push it in great\r\nmasses above the surrounding level, after the analogy of waves which\r\ndash themselves into foam against similar obstructions. In front of the\r\n_nunataks_ there is uniformly a depression, like the eddies which appear\r\nin the current below obstacles in running water.\r\n\r\nOver some portions of the surface of the glacier there is a miniature\r\nriver system, consisting of a main stream, with numerous tributaries,\r\nbut all flowing in channels of deep blue ice. Before reaching the front\r\nof the glacier, however, each one of these plunges down into a crevasse,\r\nor _moulin_, to swell the larger current, which may be heard rushing\r\nalong in an impetuous course hundreds of feet beneath, and far out of\r\nsight. The portion of the glacier in which there is the most rapid\r\nmotion is characterised by innumerable crags and domes and pinnacles of\r\nice, projecting above the general level, whose bases are separated by\r\nfissures, extending in many cases more than a hundred feet below the\r\ngeneral level. These irregularities result from the combined effect\r\nof the differential motion (as illustrated in the diagram on page 4),\r\nand the influence of sunshine and warm air in irregularly melting the\r\nunprotected masses. The description given in our introductory chapter of\r\nmedial moraines and ice-pillars is amply illustrated everywhere upon the\r\nsurface of the Muir Glacier. I measured one block of stone which was\r\ntwenty feet square and about the same height, standing on a pedestal of\r\nice three or four feet high.\r\n\r\nThe mountains forming the periphery of this amphitheatre rise to a height\r\nof several thousand feet; Mount Fairweather, upon the northwest, from\r\nwhose flanks probably a portion of the ice comes, being, in fact, more\r\nthan fifteen thousand feet high. The mouth of the amphitheatre is three\r\nmiles wide, in a line extending from shoulder to shoulder of the low\r\nmountains which guard it. The actual water-front where the ice meets\r\ntide-water is one mile and a half.[AI] Here the depth of the inlet is so\r\ngreat that the front of the ice breaks off in icebergs of large size,\r\nwhich float away to be dissolved at their leisure. At the water's edge\r\nthe ice presents a perpendicular front of from two hundred and fifty to\r\nfour hundred feet in height, and the depth of the water in the middle of\r\nthe inlet immediately in front of the ice is upwards of seven hundred\r\nfeet; thus giving a total height to the precipitous front of a thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AI: These are the measurements of Professor Reid. In my former\r\nvolume I have given the dimensions as somewhat smaller.]\r\n\r\nThe formation of icebergs can here be studied to admirable advantage.\r\nDuring the month in which we encamped in the vicinity the process\r\nwas going on continuously. There was scarcely an interval of fifteen\r\nminutes during the whole time in which the air was not rent with the\r\nsignificant boom connected with the \"calving\" of a berg. Sometimes this\r\nwas occasioned by the separation of a comparatively small mass of ice\r\nfrom near the top of the precipitous wall, which would fall into the\r\nwater below with a loud splash. At other times I have seen a column of\r\nice from top to bottom of the precipice split off and fall over into the\r\nwater, giving rise to great waves, which would lash the shore with foam\r\ntwo miles below.\r\n\r\nThis manner of the production of icebergs differs from that which has\r\nbeen ordinarily represented in the text-books, but it conforms to the law\r\nof glacial motion, which we will describe a little later, namely, that\r\nthe upper strata of ice move faster than the lower. Hence the tendency\r\nis constantly to push the upper strata forwards, so as to produce\r\na perpendicular or even projecting front, after the analogy of the\r\nformation of breakers on the shelving shore of a large body of water.\r\n\r\nEvidently, however, these masses of ice which break off from above the\r\nwater do not reach the whole distance to the bottom of the glacier below\r\nthe water; so that a projecting foot of ice remains extending to an\r\nindefinite distance underneath the surface. But at occasional intervals,\r\nas the superincumbent masses of ice above the surface fall off and\r\nrelieve the strata below of their weight, these submerged masses suddenly\r\nrise, often shooting up considerably higher than they ultimately remain\r\nwhen coming to rest. The bergs formed by this latter process often bear\r\nmuch earthy material upon them, which is carried away with the floating\r\nice, to be deposited finally wherever the melting chances to take place.\r\n\r\nNumerous opportunities are furnished about the front and foot of\r\nthis vast glacier to observe the manner of the formation of _kames_,\r\nkettle-holes, and various other irregular forms into which glacial\r\n_débris_ is accustomed to accumulate. Over portions of the decaying\r\nfoot of the glacier, which was deeply covered with morainic _débris_,\r\nthe supporting ice is being gradually removed through the influence of\r\nsubglacial streams or of abandoned tunnels, which permit the air to exert\r\nits melting power underneath. In some places where old _moulins_ had\r\nexisted, the supporting ice is melting away, so that the superincumbent\r\nmass of sand, gravel, and boulders is slowly sliding into a common\r\ncentre, like grain in a hopper. This must produce a conical hill, to\r\nremain, after the ice has all melted away, a mute witness of the\r\nimpressive and complicated forces which have been so long in operation\r\nfor its production.\r\n\r\nIn other places I have witnessed the formation of a long ridge of gravel\r\nby the gradual falling in of the roof of a tunnel which had been occupied\r\nby a subglacial stream, and over which there was deposited a great amount\r\nof morainic material. As the roof gave way, this was constantly falling\r\nto the bottom, where, being exempt from further erosive agencies, it must\r\nremain as a gravel ridge or kame.\r\n\r\nIn other places, still, there were vast masses of ice covering many\r\nacres, and buried beneath a great depth of morainic material which had\r\nbeen swept down upon it while joined to the main glacier. In the retreat\r\nof the ice, however, these masses had become isolated, and the sand,\r\ngravel, and boulders were sliding down the wasting sides and forming long\r\nridges of _débris_ along the bottom, which, upon the final melting of\r\nthe ice, will be left as a complicated network of ridges and knolls of\r\ngravel, enclosing an equally complicated nest of kettle-holes.\r\n\r\nBeyond Cross Sound the Pacific coast is bounded for several hundred\r\nmiles by the magnificent semicircle of mountains known as the St. Elias\r\nAlps, with Mount Crillon at the south, having an elevation of nearly\r\nsixteen thousand feet, and St. Elias in the centre, rising to a greater\r\nheight. Everywhere along this coast, as far as the Alaskan Peninsula,\r\nvast glaciers come down from the mountain-sides, and in many cases their\r\nprecipitous fronts form the shore-line for many miles at a time. Icy\r\nBay, just to the south of Mount St, Elias, is fitly named, on account of\r\nthe extent of the glaciers emptying into it and the number of icebergs\r\ncumbering its waters.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1890 a party, under the lead of Mr. I. C. Russell, of\r\nthe United States Geological Survey, made an unsuccessful attempt to\r\nscale the heights of Mount St. Elias; but the information brought back\r\nby them concerning the glaciers of the region amply repaid them for their\r\ntoil and expense, and consoled them for the failure of their immediate\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--By the courtesy of the National Geographical\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\nLeaving Yakutat Bay, and following the route indicated upon the\r\naccompanying map, they travelled on glacial ice almost the entire\r\ndistance to the foot of Mount St. Elias. The numerous glaciers coming\r\ndown from the summit of the mountain-ridge become confluent nearer the\r\nshore, and spread out over an area of about a thousand square miles. This\r\nis fitly named the Malaspina Glacier, after the Spanish explorer who\r\ndiscovered it in 1792.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to add further particulars concerning the results\r\nof this expedition, since they are so similar to those already detailed\r\nin connection with the Muir Glacier. A feature, however, of special\r\ninterest, pertains to the glacial lakes which are held in place by the\r\nglacial ice at an elevation of thousands of feet above the sea. One of\r\nconsiderable size is indicated upon the map just south of what was called\r\nBlossom Island, which, however, is not an island, but simply a _nunatak_,\r\nthe ice here surrounding a considerable area of fertile land, which is\r\ncovered with dense forests and beautified by a brilliant assemblage of\r\nflowering plants. In other places considerable vegetation was found upon\r\nthe surface of moraines, which were probably still in motion with the\r\nunderlying ice.\r\n\r\n_Greenland._--The continental proportions of Greenland, and the extent\r\nto which its area is covered by glacial ice, make it by far the most\r\nimportant accessible field for glacial observations. The total area of\r\nGreenland can not be less than five hundred thousand square miles--equal\r\nin extent to the portion of the United States east of the Mississippi\r\nand north of the Ohio. It is now pretty evident that the whole of this\r\narea, except a narrow border about the southern end, is covered by one\r\ncontinuous sheet of moving ice, pressing outward on every side towards\r\nthe open water of the surrounding seas.\r\n\r\nFor a long time it was the belief of many that a large region in the\r\ninterior of Greenland was free from ice, and was perhaps inhabited.\r\nIt was in part to solve this problem that Baron Nordenskiöld set out\r\nupon his expedition of 1883. Ascending the ice-sheet from Disco Bay, in\r\nlatitude 69°, he proceeded eastward for eighteen days across a continuous\r\nice-field. Rivers were flowing in channels upon the surface like those\r\ncut on land in horizontal strata of shale or sandstone, only that the\r\npure deep blue of the ice-walls was, by comparison, infinitely more\r\nbeautiful. These rivers were not, however, perfectly continuous. After\r\nflowing for a distance in channels on the surface, they, one and all,\r\nplunged with deafening roar into some yawning crevasse, to find their way\r\nto the sea through subglacial channels. Numerous lakes with shores of ice\r\nwere also encountered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Map of Greenland. The arrow-points mark the\r\nmargin of the ice-field.]\r\n\r\n\"On bending down the ear to the ice,\" says this explorer, \"we could hear\r\non every side a peculiar subterranean hum, proceeding from rivers flowing\r\nwithin the ice; and occasionally a loud, single report, like that of a\r\ncannon, gave notice of the formation of a new glacier-cleft.... In the\r\nafternoon we saw at some distance from us a well-defined pillar of mist,\r\nwhich, when we approached it, appeared to rise from a bottomless abyss,\r\ninto which a mighty glacier-river fell. The vast, roaring water-mass had\r\nbored for itself a vertical hole, probably down to the rock, certainly\r\nmore than two thousand feet beneath, on which the glacier rested.\"[AJ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AJ: Geological Magazine, vol. ix, pp. 393, 399.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteen days Nordenskiöld found himself about a\r\nhundred and fifty miles from his starting-point, and about five thousand\r\nfeet above the sea. Here the party rested, and sent two Eskimos forward\r\non _skidor_--a kind of long wooden skate, with which they could move\r\nrapidly over the ice, notwithstanding the numerous small, circular holes\r\nwhich everywhere pitted the surface. These Eskimos were gone fifty-seven\r\nhours, having slept only four hours of the period. It is estimated that\r\nthey made about a hundred and fifty miles, and attained an altitude of\r\nsix thousand feet. The ice is reported as rising in distinct terraces,\r\nand as seemingly boundless beyond. If this is the case, two hundred miles\r\nfrom Disco Bay, there would seem little hope of finding in Greenland\r\nan interior freed from ice. So we may pretty confidently speak of that\r\ncontinental body of land as still enveloped in an ice-sheet. Up to about\r\nlatitude 75°, however, the continent is fringed by a border of islands,\r\nover which there is no continuous covering of ice. In south Greenland\r\nthe continuous ice-sheet is reached about thirty miles back from the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nA summary of the results of Greenland exploration was given by Dr. Kink\r\nin 1886, from which it appears that since 1876 one thousand miles of\r\nthe coast-line have been carefully explored by entering every fiord and\r\nattempting to reach the inland ice. According to this authority--\r\n\r\nWe are now able to demonstrate that a movement of ice from the central\r\nregions of Greenland to the coast continually goes on, and must be\r\nsupposed to act upon the ground over which it is pushed so as to detach\r\nand transport fragments of it for such a distance.... The plainest idea\r\nof the ice-formation here in question is given by comparing it with an\r\ninundation.... Only the marginal parts show irregularity; towards the\r\ninterior the surface grows more and more level and passes into a plain\r\nvery slightly rising in the same direction. It has been proved that,\r\nascending its extreme verge, where it has spread like a lava-stream over\r\nthe lower ground in front of it, the irregularities are chiefly met with\r\nup to a height of 2,000 feet, but the distance from the margin in which\r\nthe height is reached varies much. While under 68-1/2° north latitude it\r\ntook twenty-four miles before this elevation was attained, in 72-1/2° the\r\nsame height was arrived at in half the distance....\r\n\r\nA general movement of the whole mass from the central regions towards the\r\nsea is still continued, but it concentrates its force to comparatively\r\nfew points in the most extraordinary degree. These points are represented\r\nby the ice-fiords, through which the annual surplus ice is carried off\r\nin the shape of bergs.... In Danish Greenland are found five of the\r\nfirst, four of the second, and eight of the third (or least productive)\r\nclass, besides a number of inlets which only receive insignificant\r\nfragments. Direct measurements of the velocity have now been applied on\r\nthree first-rate and one second-rate fiords, all situated between 69°\r\nand 71° north latitude. The measurements have been repeated during the\r\ncoldest and the warmest season, and connected with surveying and other\r\ninvestigations of the inlets and their environs. It is now proved that\r\nthe glacier branches which produce the bergs proceed incessantly at a\r\nrate of thirty to fifty feet per diem, this movement being not at all\r\ninfluenced by the seasons. . . .\r\n\r\nIn the ice-fiord of Jakobshavn, which spreads its enormous bergs over\r\nDisco Bay and probably far into the Atlantic, the productive part of the\r\nglacier is 4,500 metres (about 2-1/2 miles) broad. The movement along its\r\nmiddle line, which is quicker than on the sides nearer the shores, can\r\nbe rated at fifty feet per diem. The bulk of ice here annually forced\r\ninto the sea would, if taken on the shore, make a mountain two miles\r\nlong, two miles broad, and 1,000 feet high. The ice-fiord of Torsukatak\r\nreceives four or five branches of the glacier; the most productive of\r\nthem is about 9,000 metres broad (five miles), and moves between sixteen\r\nand thirty-two feet per diem. The large Karajak Glacier, about 7,000\r\nmetres (four miles) broad, proceeds at a rate of from twenty-two to\r\nthirty-eight feet per diem. Finally, a glacier branch dipping into the\r\nfiord of Jtivdliarsuk, 5,800 metres broad (three miles), moved between\r\ntwenty-four and forty-six feet per diem.[AK]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AK: See Transactions of the Edinburgh Geological Society for\r\nFebruary 18, 1886, vol. v, part ii, pp. 286-293.]\r\n\r\nThe principal part of our information concerning the glaciers of\r\nGreenland north of Melville Bay was obtained by Drs. Kane and Hayes,\r\nin 1853 and 1854, while conducting an expedition in search of Sir\r\nJohn Franklin and his unfortunate crew. Dr. Hayes conducted another\r\nexpedition to the same desolate region in 1860, while other explorers\r\nhave to some extent supplemented their observations. The largest glacier\r\nwhich they saw enters the sea between latitude 79° and 80°, where it\r\npresents a precipitous discharging front more than sixty miles in width\r\nand hundreds of feet in perpendicular height.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane gives his first impressions of this grand glacier in the\r\nfollowing vivid description:\r\n\r\n\"I will not attempt to do better by florid description. Men only\r\nrhapsodize about Niagara and the ocean. My notes speak simply of the\r\n'long, ever-shining line of cliff diminished to a well-pointed wedge in\r\nthe perspective'; and, again, of 'the face of glistening ice, sweeping\r\nin a long curve from the low interior, the facets in front intensely\r\nilluminated by the sun.' But this line of cliff rose in a solid,\r\nglassy wall three hundred feet above the water-level, with an unknown,\r\nunfathomable depth below it; and its curved face, sixty miles in length\r\nfrom Cape Agassiz to Cape Forbes, vanished into unknown space at not more\r\nthan a single day's railroad-travel from the pole. The interior, with\r\nwhich it communicated and from which it issued, was an unsurveyed _mer de\r\nglace_--an ice-ocean to the eye, of boundless dimensions.\r\n\r\n\"It was in full sight--the mighty crystal bridge which connects the two\r\ncontinents of America and Greenland. I say continents, for Greenland,\r\nhowever insulated it may ultimately prove to be, is in mass strictly\r\ncontinental. Its least possible axis, measured from Cape Farewell to the\r\nline of this glacier, in the neighbourhood of the eightieth parallel,\r\ngives a length of more than 1,200 miles, not materially less than that of\r\nAustralia from its northern to its southern cape.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine, now, the centre of such a continent, occupied through nearly\r\nits whole extent by a deep, unbroken sea of ice that gathers perennial\r\nincrease from the water-shed of vast snow-covered mountains and all the\r\nprecipitations of its atmosphere upon its own surface. Imagine this,\r\nmoving onwards like a great glacial river, seeking outlets at every fiord\r\nand valley, rolling icy cataracts into the Atlantic and Greenland seas;\r\nand, having at last reached the northern limit of the land that has borne\r\nit up, pouring out a mighty frozen torrent into unknown arctic space!\r\n\r\n\"It is thus, and only thus, that we must form a just conception of a\r\nphenomenon like this great glacier. I had looked in my own mind for such\r\nan appearance, should I ever be fortunate enough to reach the northern\r\ncoast of Greenland; but, now that it was before me, I could hardly\r\nrealize it. I had recognized, in my quiet library at home, the beautiful\r\nanalogies which Forbes and Studer have developed between the glacier and\r\nthe river. But I could not comprehend at first this complete substitution\r\nof ice for water.\r\n\r\n\"It was slowly that the conviction dawned on me that I was looking upon\r\nthe counterpart of the great river-system of Arctic Asia and America. Yet\r\nhere were no water-feeders from the south. Every particle of moisture had\r\nits origin within the polar circle and had been converted into ice. There\r\nwere no vast alluvions, no forest or animal traces borne down by liquid\r\ntorrents. Here was a plastic, moving, semi-solid mass, obliterating life,\r\nswallowing rocks and islands, and ploughing its way with irresistible\r\nmarch through the crust of an investing sea.\"[AL]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AL: Arctic Explorations in the Years 1853, 1854, and 1855, vol.\r\ni, pp. 225-228.]\r\n\r\nMuch less is known concerning the eastern coast of Greenland than\r\nabout the western coast. For a long time it was supposed that there\r\nmight be a considerable population in the lower latitudes along the\r\neastern side. But that is now proved to be a mistake. The whole coast\r\nis very inhospitable and difficult of approach. From latitude 65° to\r\nlatitude 69° little or nothing is known of it. In 1822-'23 Scoresby,\r\nCleavering, and Sabine hastily explored the coast from latitude 69° to\r\n76°, and reported numerous glaciers descending to the sea-level through\r\nextensive fiords, from which immense icebergs float out and render\r\nnavigation dangerous. In 1869 and 1870 the second North-German Expedition\r\npartly explored the coast between latitude 73° and 77°. Mr. Payer, an\r\nexperienced Alpine explorer, who accompanied the expedition, reports the\r\ncountry as much broken, and the glaciers as \"subordinated in position to\r\nthe higher peaks, and having their moraines, both lateral and terminal,\r\nlike those of the Alpine ranges, and on a still grander scale.\" Petermann\r\nPeak, in latitude 73°, is reported as 13,000 feet high. Captain Koldewey,\r\nchief of the expedition, found extensive plateaus on the mainland, in\r\nlatitude 75°, to be \"entirely clear of snow, although only sparsely\r\ncovered with vegetation.\" The mountains in this vicinity, also, rising to\r\na height of more than 2,000 feet, were free from snow in the summer. Some\r\nof the fiords in this vicinity penetrate the continent through several\r\ndegrees of longitude.\r\n\r\nAn interesting episode of this expedition was the experience of the crew\r\nof the ship Hansa, which was caught in the ice and destroyed. The crew,\r\nhowever, escaped by encamping on the ice-floe which had crushed the ship.\r\nFrom this, as it slowly floated towards the south through several degrees\r\nof latitude, they had opportunity to make many important observations\r\nupon the continent itself. As viewed from this unique position the coast\r\nhad the appearance everywhere of being precipitous, with mountains of\r\nconsiderable height rising in the background, from which numerous small\r\nglaciers descended to the sea-level.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 Dr. F. Nansen, with Lieutenant Sverdrup and four others, was\r\nleft by a whaler on the ice-pack bordering the east of Greenland about\r\nlatitude 65°, and in sight of the coast. For twelve days the party was\r\non the ice-pack floating south, and so actually reached the coast only\r\nabout latitude 64°. From this point they attempted to cross the inland\r\nice in a northwesterly direction towards Christianshaab. They soon\r\nreached a height of 7,000 feet, and were compelled by severe northerly\r\nstorms to diverge from their course, taking a direction more to the west.\r\nThe greatest height attained was 9,500 feet, and the party arrived on the\r\nwestern coast at Ameralik Fiord, a little south of Godhaab, about the\r\nsame latitude at which they entered.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that subsequent investigations have confirmed in a\r\nremarkable manner the sagacious conclusions made by the eminent Scotch\r\ngeologist and glacialist Robert Brown in 1875, soon after his own\r\nexpedition to the country. \"I look upon Greenland and its interior\r\nice-field,\" he writes, \"in the light of a broad-lipped, shallow vessel,\r\nbut with chinks in the lips here and there, and the glacier like viscous\r\nmatter in it. As more is poured in, the viscous matter will run over the\r\nedges, naturally taking the line of the chinks as its line of outflow.\r\nThe broad lips of the vessel are the outlying islands or 'outskirts';\r\nthe viscous matter in the vessel the inland ice, the additional matter\r\ncontinually being poured in in the form of the enormous snow covering,\r\nwhich, winter after winter, for seven or eight months in the year, falls\r\nalmost continuously on it; the chinks are the fiords or valleys down\r\nwhich the glaciers, representing the outflowing viscous matter, empty the\r\nsurplus of the vessel--in other words, the ice floats out in glaciers,\r\noverflows the land in fact, down the valleys and fiords of Greenland\r\nby force of the superincumbent weight of snow, just as does the grain\r\non the floor of a barn (as admirably described by Mr. Jamieson) when\r\nanother sackful is emptied on the top of the mound already on the floor.\r\n'The floor is flat, and therefore does not conduct the grain in any\r\ndirection; the outward motion is due to the pressure of the particles\r\nof grain on one another; and, given a floor of infinite extension and a\r\npile of sufficient amount, the mass would move outward to any distance,\r\nand with a very slight pitch or slope it would slide forward along the\r\nincline.' To this let me add that if the floor on the margin of the heap\r\nof grain was undulating the stream of grain would take the course of\r\nsuch undulations. The want, therefore, of much slope in a country and\r\nthe absence of any great mountain-range are of very little moment to the\r\nmovement of land-ice, _provided we have snow enough_\" On another page Dr.\r\nBrown had well said that \"the country seems only a circlet of islands\r\nseparated from one another by deep fiords or straits, and bound together\r\non the landward side by the great ice covering which overlies the whole\r\ninterior.... No doubt under this ice there lies land, just as it lies\r\nunder the sea; but nowadays none can be seen, and as an insulating medium\r\nit might as well be water.\"\r\n\r\nIn his recently published volumes descriptive of the journey across\r\nthe Greenland ice-sheet, alluded to on page 39, Dr. Nansen sums up his\r\ninferences in very much the same way: \"The ice-sheet rises comparatively\r\nabruptly from the sea on both sides, but more especially on the east\r\ncoast, while its central portion is tolerably flat. On the whole, the\r\ngradient decreases the farther one gets into the interior, and the mass\r\nthus presents the form of a shield with a surface corrugated by gentle,\r\nalmost imperceptible, undulations lying more or less north and south,\r\nand with its highest point not placed symmetrically, but very decidedly\r\nnearer the east coast than the west.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this rapid glance at the existing glaciers of the world we see that\r\na great ice age is not altogether a strange thing in the world. The lands\r\nabout the south pole and Greenland are each continental in dimensions,\r\nand present at the present time accumulations of land-ice so extensive,\r\nso deep, and so alive with motion as to prepare our minds for almost\r\nanything that may be suggested concerning the glaciated condition of\r\nother portions of the earth's surface. The _vera causa_ is sufficient\r\nto accomplish anything of which glacialists have ever dreamed. It only\r\nremains to enquire what the facts really are and over how great an extent\r\nof territory the actual results of glacial action may be found. But we\r\nwill first direct more particular attention to some of the facts and\r\ntheories concerning glacial motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nGLACIAL MOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat glacial ice actually moves after the analogy of a semi-fluid has\r\nbeen abundantly demonstrated by observation. In the year 1827 Professor\r\nHugi, of Soleure, built a hut far up upon the Aar Glacier in Switzerland,\r\nin order to determine the rate of its motion. After three years he found\r\nthat it had moved 330 feet; after nine years, 2,354 feet; and after\r\nfourteen years Louis Agassiz found that its motion had been 4,712 feet.\r\nIn 1841 Agassiz began a more accurate series of observation upon the same\r\nglacier. Boring holes in the ice, he set across it a row of stakes which,\r\non visiting in 1842, he found to be no longer in a straight line. All had\r\nmoved downwards with varying velocity, those near the centre having moved\r\nfarther than the others. The displacements of the stakes were in order,\r\nfrom side to side, as follows: 160 feet, 225 feet, 269 feet, 245 feet,\r\n210 feet, and 125 feet. Agassiz followed up his observations for six\r\nyears, and in 1847 published the results in his celebrated work System\r\nGlacière.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nBut in August, 1841, the distinguished Swiss investigator had invited\r\nProfessor J. D. Forbes, of Edinburgh, to interest himself in solving the\r\nproblem of glacial motion. In response to this request, Professor Forbes\r\nspent three weeks with Agassiz upon the Aar Glacier. Stimulated by the\r\ninterest of this visit, Forbes returned to Switzerland in 1842 and began\r\na series of independent investigations upon the Mer de Glace. After a\r\nweek's observations with accurate instruments, Forbes wrote to Professor\r\nJameson, editor of the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, that he had\r\nalready made it certain that \"the central part of the glacier moves\r\nfaster than the edges in a very considerable proportion, quite contrary\r\nto the opinion generally maintained.\" This letter was dated July 4, 1842,\r\nbut was not published until the October following, Agassiz's results, so\r\nfar as then determined, were, however, published in Comptes Rendus of\r\nthe 29th of August, 1842, two months before the publication of Forbes's\r\nletter. But Agassiz's letter was dated twenty-seven days later than that\r\nof Forbes. It becomes certain, therefore, that both Agassiz and Forbes,\r\nindependently and about the same time, discovered the fact that the\r\ncentral portion of a glacier moves more rapidly than the sides.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Professor Tyndall began his systematic and fruitful observations\r\nupon the Mer de Glace and other Alpine glaciers. Professor Forbes had\r\nalready demonstrated that, with an accurate instrument of observation,\r\nthe motion of a line of stakes might be observed after the lapse\r\nof a single clay, or even of a few hours. As a result of Tyndall's\r\nobservations, it was found that the most rapid daily motion in the Mer de\r\nGlace in 1857 was about thirty-seven inches. This amount of motion was\r\nnear the lower end of the glacier On ascending the glacier, the rate was\r\nfound in general to be diminished; but the diminution was not uniform\r\nthroughout the whole distance, being affected both by the size and by the\r\ncontour of the valley. The motion in the tributary glaciers was also much\r\nless than that of the main glacier.\r\n\r\nThis diminution of movement in the tributary glaciers was somewhat\r\nproportionate to their increase in width. For example, the combined\r\nwidth of the three tributaries uniting to form the Mer de Glace is 2,597\r\nyards; but a short distance below the junction of these tributaries the\r\ntotal width of the Mer de Glace itself is only 893 yards, or one-third\r\nthat of the tributaries combined. Yet, though the depth of the ice is\r\nprobably here much greater than in the tributaries, the rapidity of\r\nmovement is between two and three times as great as that of any one of\r\nthe branches.[AM]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AM: See Tyndall's Forms of Water, pp. 78-82.]\r\n\r\nFrom Tyndall's observations it appears also that the line of most rapid\r\nmotion is not exactly in the middle of the channel, but is pushed by its\r\nown momentum from one side to the other of the middle, so as always to be\r\nnearer the concave side; in this respect conforming, as far as its nature\r\nwill permit, to the motion of water in a tortuous channel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to account for this differential motion upon the surface\r\nof a glacier, since it is clear that the friction of the sides of the\r\nchannel must retard the motion of ice as it does that of water. It is\r\nclear also that the friction of the bottom must retard the motion of ice\r\neven more than it is known to do in the case of water. In the formation\r\nof breakers, when the waves roll in upon a shallowing beach, every one\r\nis familiar with the effect of the bottom upon the moving mass. Here\r\nfriction retards the lower strata of water, and the upper strata slide\r\nover the lower, and, where the water is of sufficient depth and the\r\nmotion is sufficiently great, the crest breaks down in foam before the\r\never-advancing tide. A similar phenomenon occurs when dams give way and\r\nreservoirs suddenly pour their contents into the restricted channels\r\nbelow. At such times the advancing water rolls onwards like the surf with\r\na perpendicular front, varying in height according to the extent of the\r\nflood.\r\n\r\nSeasoning from these phenomena connected with moving water, it was\r\nnaturally suggested to Professor Tyndall that an analogous movement must\r\ntake place in a glacier. Choosing, therefore, a favourable place for\r\nobservation on the Mer de Glace where the ice emerged from a gorge, he\r\nfound a perpendicular side about one hundred and fifty feet in height\r\nfrom bottom to top. In this face he drove stakes in a perpendicular line\r\nfrom top to bottom. Upon subsequently observing them, Tyndall found, as\r\nhe expected, that there was a differential motion among them as in the\r\nstakes upon the surface. The retarding effect of friction upon the bottom\r\nwas evident. The stake near the top moved forwards about three times as\r\nfast as the one which was only four feet from the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe most rapid motion (thirty-seven inches per day) observed by Professor\r\nTyndall upon the Alpine glaciers occurred in midsummer. In winter\r\nthe rate was only about one-half as great; but in the year 1875 the\r\nNorwegian geologist, Helland, reported a movement of twenty metres (about\r\nsixty-five feet) per day in the Jakobshavn Glacier which enters Disco\r\nBay, Greenland, about latitude 70°. For some time there was a disposition\r\non the part of many scientific men to doubt the correctness of Holland's\r\ncalculations. Subsequent observations have shown, however, that from the\r\ncomparatively insignificant glaciers of the Alps they were not justified\r\nin drawing inferences with respect to the motion of the vastly larger\r\nmasses which come down to the sea through the fiords of Greenland.\r\nThe Jakobshavn Glacier was about two and a half miles in width and its\r\ndepth very likely more than a thousand feet, making a cross-section of\r\nmore than 1,400,000 square yards, whereas the cross-section of the Mer\r\nde Glace at Montanvert is estimated to be but 190,000 square yards or\r\nonly about one-seventh the above estimate for the Greenland glacier. As\r\nthe friction of the sides would be no greater upon a large stream than\r\nupon a small one, while upon the bottom it would be only in proportion\r\nto the area, it is evident that we cannot tell beforehand how rapidly\r\nan increase in the volume of the ice might augment the velocity of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, all reasonable grounds for distrusting the accuracy of\r\nHelland's estimates seem to have been removed by later investigations.\r\nAccording to my own observations in the summer of 1886 upon the Muir\r\nGlacier, Alaska, the central portions, a mile back from the front of\r\nthat vast ice-current, were moving from sixty-five to seventy feet per\r\nday. These observations were taken with a sextant upon pinnacles of ice\r\nrecognizable from a baseline established upon the shore. It is fair\r\nto add, however, that during the summer of 1890 Professor H. F. Reid\r\nattempted to measure the motion of the same glacier by methods promising\r\ngreater accuracy than could be obtained by mine. He endeavoured to plant,\r\nafter the method of Tyndall, a line of stakes across the ice-current. But\r\nwith his utmost efforts, working inwards from both sides, he was unable\r\nto accomplish his purpose, and so left unmeasured a quarter of a mile\r\nor more of the most rapidly-moving portion of the glacier. His results,\r\ntherefore, of ten feet per day in the most rapidly-moving portion\r\nobserved cannot discredit my own observations on a portion of the stream\r\ninaccessible by his method. A quarter of a mile in width near the centre\r\nof so vast a glacier gives ample opportunity for a much greater rate of\r\nmotion than that observed by Professor Reid. Especially may this be true\r\nin view of Tyndall's suggestion that the contour of the bottom over which\r\nthe ice flows may greatly affect the rate in certain places. A sudden\r\ndeepening of the channel may affect the motion of ice in a glacier as\r\nmuch as it does that of water in a river.\r\n\r\nOther observations also amply sustain the conclusions of Helland. As\r\nalready stated, the Danish surveying party under Steenstrup, after\r\nseveral years' work upon the southwestern coast of Greenland, have\r\nascertained that the numerous glaciers coming down to the sea in that\r\nregion and furnishing the icebergs incessantly floating down Baffin's\r\nBay, move at a rate of from thirty to fifty feet per day, while\r\nLieutenants Ryder and Bloch, of the Danish Navy, who spent the year 1887\r\nin exploring the coast in the vicinity of Upernavik, about latitude 73°,\r\nfound that the great glacier entering the fiord east of the village had a\r\nvelocity of ninety-nine feet per day during the month of August.[AN]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AN: Nature, December 29, 1887.]\r\n\r\nIt is easier to establish the fact of glacial motion than to explain how\r\nthe motion takes place, for ice seems to be as brittle as glass. This,\r\nhowever, is true of it only when compelled suddenly to change its form.\r\nWhen subjected to slow and long-continued pressure it gradually yet\r\nreadily yields, and takes on new forms. From this capacity of ice, it has\r\ncome to be regarded by some as a really viscous substance, like tar or\r\ncooling lava, and upon that theory Professor Forbes endeavours to explain\r\nall glacial movement.\r\n\r\nThe theory, however, seems to be contradicted by familiar facts; for\r\nthe iceman, after sawing a shallow groove across a piece of ice, can\r\nthen split it as easily as he would a piece of sandstone or wood. On the\r\nglaciers themselves, likewise, the existence of innumerable crevasses\r\nwould seem to contradict the plastic theory of glacier motion; for,\r\nwherever the slope of the glacier's bed increases, crevasses are formed\r\nby the increased strain to which the ice is subjected. Crevasses are also\r\nformed in rapidly-moving glaciers by the slight strain occasioned by the\r\nmore rapid motion of the middle portion. Still, in the words of Tyndall,\r\n\"it is undoubted that the glacier moves like a viscous body. The centre\r\nflows past the sides, the top flows over the bottom, and the motion\r\nthrough a curved valley corresponds to fluid motion.\"[AO]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AO: Forms of Water, p. 163.]\r\n\r\nTo explain this combination of the seemingly contradictory qualities of\r\nbrittleness and viscosity in ice, physicists have directed attention\r\nto the remarkable transformations which take place in water at the\r\nfreezing-point. Faraday discovered in 1850 that \"when two pieces of\r\nthawing ice are placed together they freeze together at the point of\r\ncontact.[AP]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AP: Ibid., p. 164.]\r\n\r\n\"Place a number of fragments of ice in a basin of water and cause them\r\nto touch each other; they freeze together where they touch. You can form\r\na chain of such fragments; and then, by taking hold of one end of the\r\nchain, you can draw the whole series after it. Chains of icebergs are\r\nsometimes formed in this way in the arctic seas.\"[AQ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AQ: Ibid., pp. 164, 165.]\r\n\r\nThis is really what takes place when a hard snow-ball is made by pressure\r\nin the hand. So, by subjecting fragments of ice to pressure it is first\r\ncrumbled to powder, and then, as the particles are pressed together in\r\nclose contact, it resumes the nature of ice again, though in a different\r\nform, taking now the shape of the mould in which it has been pressed.\r\n\r\nThus it is supposed that, when the temperature of ice is near the\r\nmelting-point, the pressure of the superincumbent mass may produce at\r\ncertain points insensible disintegration, while, upon the removal of\r\nthe pressure by change of position, regulation instantly takes place,\r\nand thus the phenomena which simulate plasticity are produced. As the\r\nfreezing-point of water is, within a narrow range, determined by the\r\namount of pressure to which it is subjected, it is not difficult to see\r\nhow these changes may occur. Pressure slightly lowers the freezing-point,\r\nand so would liquefy the portions of ice subjected to greatest pressure,\r\nwherever that might be in the mass of the glacier, and thus permit\r\na momentary movement of the particles, until they should recongeal\r\nin adjusting themselves to spaces of less pressure.[AR] This is the\r\ntheory by which Professor James Thompson would account for the apparent\r\nplasticity of glacial ice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AR: Forms of Water, p. 168.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF PAST GLACIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts from which we draw the inference that vast areas of the earth's\r\nsurface which are now free from glaciers were, at a comparatively\r\nrecent time, covered with them, are fourfold, and are everywhere\r\nopen to inspection. These facts are: 1. Scratches upon the rocks. 2.\r\nExtensive unstratified deposits of clay and sand intermingled with\r\nscratched stones and loose fragments of rock. 3. Transported boulders\r\nleft in such positions and of such size as to preclude the sufficiency\r\nof water-carriage to account for them. 4. Extensive gravel terraces\r\nbordering the valleys which emerge from the glaciated areas. We will\r\nconsider these in their order:\r\n\r\n1. The scratches upon the rocks.\r\n\r\nAlmost anywhere in the region designated as having been covered with\r\nice during the Glacial period, the surface of the rocks when freshly\r\nuncovered will be found to be peculiarly marked by grooves and scratches\r\nmore or less fine, and such as could not be produced by the action of\r\nwater. But, when we consider the nature of a glacier, these marks seem\r\nto be just what would be produced by the pushing or dragging along of\r\nboulders, pebbles, gravel, and particles of sand underneath a moving mass\r\nof ice.\r\n\r\nRunning water does indeed move gravel, pebbles, and boulders along with\r\nthe current, but these objects are not held by it in a firm grasp, such\r\nas is required to make a groove or scratch in the rock. If, also, there\r\nare inequalities in the compactness or hardness of the rock, the natural\r\naction of running water is to hollow out the soft parts, and leave the\r\nharder parts projecting. But, in the phenomena which we are attributing\r\nto glacial action, there has been a movement which has steadily planed\r\ndown the surface of the underlying rock; polishing it, indeed, but also\r\ngrooving it and scratching it in a manner which could be accomplished\r\nonly by firmly held graving-tools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Bed-rock scored with glacial marks, near\r\nAmherst, Ohio. (From a photograph by Chamberlin.)]\r\n\r\nThis polishing and scratching can indeed be produced by various\r\nagencies; as, for example, by the forces which fracture the earth's\r\ncrust, and shove one portion past another, producing what is called a\r\n_slicken-side_. Or, again, avalanches or land-slides might be competent\r\nto produce the results over limited and peculiarly situated areas.\r\nIcebergs, also, and shore ice which is moved backwards and forwards\r\nby the waves, would produce a certain amount of such grooving and\r\nscratching. But the phenomena to which we refer are so extensive, and\r\noccur in such a variety of situations, that the movement of glacial ice\r\nis alone sufficient to afford a satisfactory explanation. Moreover, in\r\nAlaska, Greenland, Norway, and Switzerland, and wherever else there are\r\nliving glaciers, it is possible to follow up these grooved and striated\r\nsurfaces till they disappear underneath the existing glaciers which are\r\nnow producing the phenomena. Thus by its tracks we can, as it were,\r\nfollow this monster to its lair with as great certainty as we could any\r\nanimal with whose footprints we had become familiar.\r\n\r\n2. The till, or boulder-clay.\r\n\r\nA second sign of the former existence of glaciers over any area consists\r\nof an unstratified deposit of earthy material, of greater or less depth,\r\nin which scratched pebbles and fragments of rock occur without any\r\ndefinite arrangement.\r\n\r\nMoving water is a most perfect sieve. During floods, a river shoves\r\nalong over its bed gravel and pebbles of considerable size, whereas in\r\ntime of low-water the current may be so gentle as to transport nothing\r\nbut fine sand, and the clay will be carried still farther onwards, to\r\nsettle in the still water and form a delta about the river's mouth. The\r\ntransporting capacity of running water is in direct ratio to the sixth\r\npower of its velocity. Other things being equal, if the velocity be\r\ndoubled, the size of the grains of sand or gravel which it transports\r\nis increased sixty-four fold.[AS] So frequent are the changes in the\r\nvelocity of running water, that the stratification of its deposits is\r\nalmost necessary and universal. If large fragments of rocks or boulders\r\nare found embedded in stratified clay, it is pretty surely a sign that\r\nthey have been carried to their position by floating ice. A small\r\nmountain stream with great velocity may move a good-sized boulder, while\r\nthe Amazon, with its mighty but slow-moving current, would pass by it\r\nforever without stirring it from its position. But the vast area which\r\nis marked in our map as having been covered with ice during the Glacial\r\nperiod is characterised by deep and extensive deposits of loose material\r\ndevoid of stratification, and composed of soil and rock gathered in\r\nconsiderable part from other localities, and mixed in an indiscriminate\r\nmass with material which has originated in the disintegration of the\r\nunderlying local strata.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AS: Le Conte's Geology, p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Scratched stone from the till of Boston.\r\nNatural size about one foot and a half long by ten inches wide. (From\r\nphotograph.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Typical section of till in Seattle. Washington\r\nState, about two hundred feet above Puget Sound. This is on the height\r\nbetween the sound and Lake Washington.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Ideal section, showing how the till overlies the\r\nstratified rocks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Vessel Rock, a glacial boulder in Gilsum. N. H.\r\n(C. H. Hitchcock.)]\r\n\r\n3. Transported boulders.\r\n\r\nWhere there is a current of water deep enough to float large masses of\r\nice, there is scarcely any limit to the size of boulders which may be\r\ntransported upon them, or to the distance to which the boulders may be\r\ncarried and dropped upon the bottom. The icebergs which break off from\r\nthe glaciers of Greenland may bear their burdens of rock far down into\r\nthe Atlantic, depositing them finally amidst the calcareous ooze and\r\nthe fine sediment from the Gulf Stream which is slowly covering the\r\narea between Northern America and Europe. Northern streams like the St.\r\nLawrence, which are deeply frozen over with ice in the winter, and are\r\nheavily flooded as the ice breaks up in the spring, afford opportunity\r\nfor much transportation of boulders in the direction of their current.\r\nIn attributing the transportation of a boulder to glacial ice, it is\r\nnecessary, therefore, to examine the contour of the country, so as to\r\neliminate from the problem the possibility of the effects having been\r\nproduced by floating ice.\r\n\r\nAnother source of error against which one has to be on his guard arises\r\nfrom the close resemblance of boulders resulting from disintegration\r\nto those which have been transported by ice from distant places. Owing\r\nto the fact that large masses of rocks, especially those which are\r\ncrystalline, are seldom homogeneous in their structure, it results that,\r\nunder the slow action of disintegrating and erosive agencies, the softer\r\nparts often are completely removed before the harder nodules are sensibly\r\naffected, and these may remain as a collection of boulders dotting the\r\nsurface. Such boulders are frequent in the granitic regions of North\r\nCarolina and vicinity, where there has been no glacial transportation.\r\nSeveral localities in Pennsylvania, also, south of the line of glacial\r\naction as delineated by Professor Lewis and myself, had previously\r\nbeen supposed to contain transported boulders of large size, but on\r\nexamination they proved in all cases to be resting upon undisturbed\r\nstrata of the parent rock, and were evidently the harder portions of\r\nthe rock left in loco by the processes of erosion spoken of. In New\r\nEngland, also, it is possible that some boulders heretofore attributed to\r\nice-action may be simply the results of these processes of disintegration\r\nand erosion. Whether they are or not can usually be determined by their\r\nlikeness or unlikeness to the rocks on which they rest; but oftentimes,\r\nwhere a particular variety of rock is exposed over a broad area, it\r\nis difficult to tell whether a boulder has suffered any extensive\r\ntransportation or not.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting and satisfactory demonstrations of the\r\ndistribution of boulders by glacial ice was furnished by Guyot in\r\nSwitzerland in 1845. His observations and argument will be most readily\r\nunderstood by reference to the accompanying map, taken from Lyell's clear\r\ndescription.[AT] The Jura Mountains are separated from the Alps by a\r\nvalley, about eighty miles in width, which constitutes the main habitable\r\nportion of Switzerland, and they rise upwards of two thousand feet above\r\nit. But large Alpine boulders are found as high as two thousand feet\r\nabove the Lake Neufchâtel upon the flanks of the Jura Mountains beyond\r\nChasseron (at the point marked G on the map), and the whole valley is\r\ndotted with Alpine boulders. Upon comparing these with the native rocks\r\nin the Alps, Guyot in many cases was able to determine the exact centres\r\nfrom which they were distributed, and the distribution is such as to\r\ndemonstrate that glacial ice was the medium of distribution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AT: Antiquity of Man, p. 299.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Map showing the outline and course of flow of\r\nthe great Rhône Glacier (after Lyell).]\r\n\r\nFor example, the dotted lines upon the map indicate the motion of the\r\ntransporting medium. On ascending the valley of the Rhône to A, the\r\ndiminutive representative of the ancient glacier is still found in\r\nexistence, and is at work transporting boulders and moraines according\r\nto the law of ice-movement. Following down the valley from A, boulders\r\nfrom the head of the Rhône Valley are found distributed as far as B at\r\nMartigny, where the valley turns at right angles towards the north. It\r\nis evident that floating ice in a stream of water would by its momentum\r\nbe carried to the left bank, so that if icebergs were the medium of\r\ntransportation we should expect to find the boulders from the right-hand\r\nside of the Rhône Valley distributed towards the left end of the great\r\nvalley of Switzerland--that is, in the direction of Geneva. But, instead,\r\nthe boulders derived from C, D, and E, on the Bernese Oberland side,\r\ninstead of crossing the valley at B, continue to keep on the right-hand\r\nside and are distributed over the main valley in the direction of the\r\nriver Aar.\r\n\r\nAs is to be expected also, the direct northward motion of the ice from\r\nB is stronger than the lateral movement to the right and left after it\r\nemerges from the mouth of the Rhône Valley, at F, and consequently it has\r\npushed forwards in a straight line, so as to raise the Alpine boulders\r\nto a greater height upon the Jura Mountains at G than anywhere else, the\r\nupper limit of boulders at G being 1,500 feet higher than the limits at I\r\nor K on the left and right, points distant about one hundred miles from\r\neach other. All the boulders to the right of the line from B to G have\r\nbeen derived from the right side of the Rhône, while all the boulders to\r\nthe left of that line have been derived from its left side.\r\n\r\nA boulder of talcose granite containing 61,000 French cubic feet,\r\nmeasuring about forty feet in one direction, came, according to\r\nCharpentier, from the point _n_, near the head of the Rhône Valley, and\r\nmust have travelled one hundred and fifty miles to reach its present\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIt scarcely needs to be added that the grooves and scratches upon the\r\nrocks over the floor of this great valley of Switzerland indicate a\r\ndirection of the ice-movement corresponding to that implied in the\r\ndistribution of boulders. Thus, at K upon the map referred to, Lyell\r\nreports that the abundant grooves and striæ upon the polished marble all\r\ntrend down the valley of the Aar.[AU]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AU: Antiquity of Man, p. 305.]\r\n\r\nSimilar facts concerning the transportation of boulders have been\r\nobserved at Trogen, in Appenzel, where boulders derived from Trons,\r\none hundred miles distant, are found to keep upon the left bank of the\r\nRhine, however much the valley may wind about; and in some places, as at\r\nMayenfeld, it turns almost at right angles, as did the Rhône at Martigny.\r\nUpon reaching the lower country at Lake Constance, these granite blocks\r\nfrom the left side of the valley deploy out upon the same side and do not\r\ncross over, as they would inevitably have done had they been borne along\r\nby currents of water.\r\n\r\nIn America Ave do not have quite so easy a field as is presented\r\nin Switzerland for the discovery of crucial instances showing that\r\nboulders have been transported by glacial ice rather than by floating\r\nice, for in Switzerland the glaciated area is comparatively small and\r\nthe diminutive remnants of former glaciers are still in existence,\r\nfurnishing a comprehensive object-lesson of great interest and convincing\r\npower. Still, it is not difficult to find decisive instances of glacial\r\ntransportation even in the broad fields of America which now retain no\r\nliving remnants of the great continental ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nAs every one who resides in or who visits New England knows, boulders are\r\nscattered freely over all parts of that region, but for a long time the\r\ntheory suggested to account for their distribution was that of floating\r\nice during a period of submergence. One of the most convincing evidences\r\nthat the boulders were distributed by glacial ice rather than by icebergs\r\nis found in Professor C. H. Hitchcock's discovery of boulders on the\r\nsummit of Mount Washington (over 6,000 feet above the sea), which he\r\nwas able to identify as derived from the ledges of light grey Bethlehem\r\ngneiss, whose nearest outcrop is in Jefferson, several miles to the\r\nnorthwest, and 3,000 or 4,000 feet lower than Mount Washington. However\r\ndifficult it may be to explain the movement of these boulders by glacial\r\nice, it is not impossible to do so, but the attempt to account for their\r\ntransportation by floating ice is utterly preposterous. No iceberg could\r\npick up boulders so far beneath the surface of the water, and even if it\r\ncould advance thus far in its work it could not by any possibility land\r\nthem afterwards upon the summit of Mount Washington.\r\n\r\nAmong the most impressive instances of boulders evidently transported\r\nby glacial ice, rather than by icebergs, were some which came to my\r\nnotice when, in company with the late Professor H. Carvill Lewis, I was\r\ntracing the glacial boundary across the State of Pennsylvania. We had\r\nreached the elevated plateau (two thousand feet above the sea) which\r\nextends westwards and southwards from the peak of Pocono Mountain, in\r\nMonroe County. This plateau consists of level strata of sandstone, the\r\nsouthern part of which is characterised by a thin sandy soil, such as is\r\nnaturally formed by the disintegration of the underlying rock, and there\r\nis no foreign material to be found in it. But, on going northwards to\r\nthe boundary of Tobyhanna township, we at once struck a large line of\r\naccumulations, stretching from east to west, and rising to a height of\r\nseventy or eighty feet. This was chiefly an accumulation of transported\r\nboulders, resembling in its structure the terminal moraines which are\r\nfound at the front of glaciers in the Alps and in Alaska, and indeed\r\nwherever active glaciers still remain. But here we were upon the summit\r\nof the mountain, where there are no higher levels to the north of\r\nus, down which the ice could flow. Besides, among these boulders we\r\nreadily recognised many of granite, which must have come either from\r\nthe Adirondack Mountains, two hundred miles to the north, or from the\r\nCanadian highlands, still farther away.\r\n\r\nLimiting our observations simply to the boulders, we should indeed have\r\nbeen at liberty to suppose that they had been transported across the\r\nvalley of the Mohawk or of the Great Lakes by floating ice during a\r\nperiod of submergence. But we were forbidden to resort to this hypothesis\r\nby the abrupt marginal line, running east and west, upon Pocono plateau,\r\nalong which these northern boulders ceased. South of this evident\r\nterminal moraine there was no barrier, and there were no northern\r\nboulders. On the theory of submergence, there was no reason for the\r\nboundary-line so clearly manifested. Ice which had floated so far would\r\nhave floated farther.\r\n\r\nStill further, on going a few miles east of the Pocono plateau, one\r\ndescends into a parallel valley, lying between Pocono Mountain and Blue\r\nMountain, and one thousand feet below their level. But our marginal\r\nsouthern boundary of transported granite rocks did not extend much\r\nfarther south in the valley than it did on the plateau, except where we\r\ncould trace the action of a running stream, evidently corresponding to\r\nthe subglacial rivers which pour forth from the front of every extensive\r\nglacier. In these facts, therefore, we had a crucial test of the glacial\r\nhypothesis, and, in view of them, could maintain, against all objectors,\r\nthe theory of the distant glacial transportation of boulders, even over\r\nvast areas of the North American continent.\r\n\r\nSince that experience, I have traced this limit of southern boulders for\r\nthousands of miles across the continent, according to the delineation\r\nwhich may be seen in the map in a later chapter. If necessary, I could\r\nindicate hundreds of places where the proof of glacial transportation\r\nis almost as clear as that on the Pocono plateau in Pennsylvania. One\r\nof the most interesting of these is on the hills in Kentucky, about\r\ntwelve miles south of the Ohio River, at Cincinnati, where I discovered\r\nboulders of a conglomerate containing many pebbles of red jasper, which\r\ncan be identified as from a limited formation cropping out in Canada,\r\nto the north of Lake Huron, six hundred or seven hundred miles distant.\r\nThat this was transported by glacial ice, and not by floating ice, is\r\nevident from the fact that here, too, there was no barrier to the south,\r\nrequiring deposits to cease at that point, and from the further fact\r\nthat boulders of this material are found in increasing frequency all\r\nthe way from Kentucky to the parent ledges in Canada. With reference to\r\nthese boulders, as with reference to those found on the summit of Mount\r\nWashington, we can reason, also, that any northerly subsidence permitting\r\na body of water to occupy the space between Kentucky and Lake Superior,\r\nand deep enough to facilitate the movement across it of floating ice,\r\nwould render it impossible for the ice to have loaded itself with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Conglomerate boulder found in Boone County,\r\nKentucky. (See text.)]\r\n\r\nThe same line of reasoning is conclusive respecting the innumerable\r\nboulders which cover the northern portion of Ohio, where I have my\r\nresidence. The whole State of Ohio, and indeed almost the entire\r\nMississippi basin between the Appalachian and the Rocky Mountains, is\r\ncompletely covered, and to a great depth, with stratified rocks which\r\nhave been but slightly disturbed in the elevation of the continent; yet,\r\ndown to an irregular border-line running east and west, granitic boulders\r\neverywhere occur in great numbers. In the locality spoken of in northern\r\nOhio the elevation of the country is from two hundred to five hundred\r\nfeet above the level of Lake Erie. The nearest outcrops of granitic rock\r\noccur about four hundred miles to the north, in Canada. After the meeting\r\nof the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Toronto\r\nin the summer of 1889, I had the privilege of joining a company of\r\ngeologists in an excursion, conducted by members of the Canadian Survey,\r\nto visit the region beyond Lake Nipissing, north of Lake Huron, where\r\nthe ancient Laurentian and Huronian rocks are most typically developed.\r\nI took advantage of the trip to collect specimens of a great variety of\r\nthe granites and gneisses and metamorphic schists and trap-rock of the\r\nregion. On bringing them home I turned them over to the professor of\r\ngeology, who at once set his class at work to see if they could match my\r\nfragments from Canada with corresponding fragments from the boulders of\r\nthe vicinity. To the great gratification, both of the pupils and myself,\r\nthey were able to do so in almost every case; and so they might have\r\ndone in any county or township to the south until reaching the limit of\r\nglacier action which I had previously mapped. Here, at Oberlin, on the\r\nnorth side of the water-shed, it is possible to imagine that we are on\r\nthe southern border of an ancient lake upon whose bosom floating ice\r\nhad brought these objects from their distant home in Canada. But this\r\ntheory would not apply to the portion of the State which is south of the\r\nwater-shed and which slopes rapidly towards the Gulf of Mexico. Yet the\r\ndistribution of boulders is practically uniform over the glaciated area\r\non both sides of the water-shed, constituting thus an indisputable proof\r\nof the glacial theory.\r\n\r\n4th. As the significance of the gravel terraces which mark the lines of\r\noutward drainage from the glaciated area cannot well be indicated in a\r\nsingle paragraph, the reader is referred for further information upon\r\nthis point to the general statements respecting them throughout the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nANCIENT GLACIERS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_New England._\r\n\r\nIn North America all the indubitable signs of glacial action are found\r\nover the entire area of New England, the southern coast being bordered\r\nby a double line of terminal moraines. The outermost of these appears in\r\nNantucket, Martha's Vineyard, No Man's Land, Block Island, and through\r\nthe entire length of Long Island--from Montauk Point, through the centre\r\nof the island, to Brooklyn, N. Y., and thence across Staten Island to\r\nPerth Amboy in New Jersey. The interior line is nearly parallel with the\r\nouter, and, beginning at the east end of Cape Cod, runs in a westerly\r\ndirection to Falmouth, and thence southwesterly through Wood's Holl, and\r\nthe Elizabeth Islands--these being, indeed, but the unsubmerged portions\r\nof the moraine. On the mainland this interior line reappears near Point\r\nJudith, on the south shore of Rhode Island, and, running slightly south\r\nof west, serves to give character to the scenery at Watch Hill, and\r\nthence crops out in the Sound as Fisher and Plum Islands, and farther\r\nwest forms the northern shore of Long Island to Port Jefferson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nGLACIAL GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES.]\r\n\r\nIn these accumulations bordering the southern shore of New England, the\r\ncharacteristic marks of glacial action can readily be detected even by\r\nthe casual observer, and prolonged examination will amply confirm the\r\nfirst impression. The material of which they are composed is, for the\r\nmost part, foreign to the localities, and can be traced to outcrops\r\nof rock at the north. The boulders scattered over the surface of Long\r\nIsland, for example, consist largely of granite, gneiss, hornblende, mica\r\nslate, and red sandstone, which are easily recognised as fragments from\r\nwell-known quarries in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts; yet\r\nthey have been transported bodily across Long Island Sound, and deposited\r\nin a heterogeneous mass through the entire length of the island. Not\r\nonly do they lie upon the surface, but, in digging into the lines of\r\nhills which constitute the backbone of Long Island, these transported\r\nboulders are found often to make up a large part of the accumulation.\r\nAlmost any of the railroad excavations in the city of Brooklyn present\r\nan interesting object-lesson respecting the composition of a terminal\r\nmoraine.\r\n\r\nAll these things are true also of the lines of moraine farther east,\r\nas just described. Professor Shaler has traced to its source a belt\r\nof boulders occurring extensively over southern Rhode Island, and\r\nfound that they have spread out pretty evenly over a triangular area\r\nto the southward, in accordance with the natural course to be pursued\r\nby an ice-movement. Nearly all of Plymouth County, in southeastern\r\nMassachusetts, is composed of foreign material, much of which can be\r\ntraced to the hills and mountains to the north. Even Plymouth Rock is a\r\nboulder from the direction of Boston, and the \"rock-bound\" shores upon\r\nwhich the Pilgrims are poetically conceived to have landed are known, in\r\nscientific prose, as piles of glacial rubbish dumped into the edge of the\r\nsea by the great continental ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nThe whole area of southeastern Massachusetts is dotted with conical\r\nknolls of sand, gravel, and boulders, separated by circular masses of\r\npeat or ponds of water, whose origin and arrangement can be accounted\r\nfor only by the peculiar agency of a decaying ice-front. Indeed, this\r\nwhole line of moraines, from the end of Cape Cod to Brooklyn, N. Y.,\r\nconsists of a reticulated network of ridges and knolls, so deposited by\r\nthe ice as to form innumerable kettle-holes which are filled with water\r\nwhere other conditions are favourable. Those which are dry are so because\r\nof their elevation above the general level, and of the looseness of the\r\nsurrounding soil; while many have been filled with a growth of peat, so\r\nthat their original character as lakelets is disguised.\r\n\r\nAs already described, these depressions, so characteristic of the\r\nglaciated region, are, in the majority of cases, supposed to have\r\noriginated by the deposition of a great quantity of earthy material\r\naround and upon the masses of ice belonging to the receding front of\r\nthe glacier, so that, when at length the ice melted away, a permanent\r\ndepression in the soil was left, without any outlet.\r\n\r\nTo some extent, however, the kettle-holes may have been formed by the\r\nirregular deposition of streams of water whose courses have crossed each\r\nother, or where eddies of considerable force have been produced in any\r\nway. The ordinary formation of kettle-holes can be observed in progress\r\non the foot of almost any glacier, or, indeed, on a small scale, during\r\nthe melting away of almost any winter's snow. Where, from any cause, a\r\nstratum of dirt has accumulated upon a mass of compact snow or ice, it\r\nwill be found to settle down in an irregular manner; furrows will be\r\nformed in various directions by currents of water, so that the melting\r\nwill proceed irregularly, and produce upon a miniature scale exactly what\r\nI have seen on a large scale over whole square miles of the decaying foot\r\nof the great Muir Glacier in Alaska. The effects of similar causes and\r\nconditions we can see on a most enormous scale in the ten thousand lakes\r\nand ponds and peat-bogs of the whole glaciated area both in North America\r\nand in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two lines of evidence of glacial action in New\r\nEngland, we should mention also the innumerable glacial grooves and\r\nscratches upon the rocks which can be found on almost any freshly\r\nuncovered surface. In New England the direction of these grooves is\r\nordinarily a little east of south. Upon the east coast of Massachusetts\r\nand New Hampshire the scratches trend much more to the east than they\r\ndo over most of the interior. This is as it should be on the glacial\r\ntheory, since the ice would naturally move outwards in the line of least\r\nresistance, which would, of course, be towards the open sea wherever\r\nthat is near. In the interior of New England the scratches upon the\r\nrocks indicate a more southerly movement in the Connecticut Valley than\r\nupon the mountains in the western part of Massachusetts. This also is as\r\nit should be upon the glacial theory. The scratches upon the mountains\r\nwere made when the ice was at its greatest depth and when it moved\r\nover the country in comparative disregard of minor irregularities of\r\nsurface, while in the valleys, at least in the later portion of the Ice\r\nage, the movement would be obstructed except in one direction. In the\r\ninterpretation of the glacial grooves and scratches it should be borne in\r\nmind that they often represent the work done during the closing stages\r\nof the period. Just as the last shove of the carpenter's plane removes\r\nthe marks of the previous work, so the last rasping of a glacial movement\r\nwears away the surfaces which have been previously polished and striated.\r\n\r\nIn various places of New England it is interesting as well as instructive\r\nto trace the direction of the ice-movement by the distribution of\r\nboulders. My own attention was early attracted to numerous fragments\r\nof gneiss in eastern Massachusetts containing beautiful crystals\r\nof feldspar, which proved to be peculiar to the region of Lake\r\nWinnepesaukee, a hundred miles to the north, and to a narrow belt\r\nstretching thence to the southwestward. In ascending almost any of the\r\nlower summits of the White Mountains one's attention can scarcely\r\nfail of being directed to the difference between the material of which\r\nthe mountains are composed and that of the numerous boulders which lie\r\nscattered over the surface. The local geologist readily recognises these\r\nboulders as pilgrims that have wandered far from their homes to the\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nTrains of boulders, such as those already described in Rhode Island, can\r\nfrequently be traced to some prominent outcrop of the rock in a hill or\r\nmountain-peak from which they have been derived. One of the earliest\r\nof these to attract attention occurs in the towns of Richmond, Lenox,\r\nand Stockbridge, in the western part of Massachusetts. Here a belt of\r\npeculiar boulders about four hundred feet wide is found to originate in\r\nthe town of Lebanon, N. Y., and to run continuously to the southeast\r\nfor a distance of nine miles. West of Fry's Hill, where the outcrop\r\noccurs, no boulders of this variety of rock are to be found, while to\r\nthe southeast the boulders gradually diminish in size as their distance\r\nfrom the outcrop increases. Near the outcrop boulders of thirty feet in\r\ndiameter occur, while nine miles away two feet is the largest diameter\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell endeavoured to explain this train of boulders by the\r\naction of icebergs during a period of submergence--supposing that, as\r\nicebergs floated past or away from this hill in Lebanon, N. Y., they\r\nwere the means of the regular distribution described. It is needless to\r\nrepeat the difficulties arising in connection with such a theory, since\r\nnow both by observation and experiment we have become more familiar\r\nwith the movement of glacial ice. What we have already said about the\r\ntransportation of boulders over Switzerland by the Alpine glaciers, and\r\nwhat is open to observation at the present time upon the large glaciers\r\nof Alaska, closely agree with the facts concerning this Richmond train of\r\nboulders, and we have no occasion to look further for a cause.\r\n\r\nIndeed, trains of boulders ought to appear almost everywhere over\r\nthe glaciated area; and so they do where all the circumstances are\r\nfavourable. But, readily to identify the train, requires that to furnish\r\nthe boulders there should be in the line of the ice-movement a projecting\r\nmass of rock hard enough to offer considerable resistance to the abrading\r\nagency of the ice and characteristic enough in its composition to be\r\nreadily recognised. Ship Rock, in Peabody, Mass., weighing about eleven\r\nhundred tons, and Mohegan Rock, in Montville, Conn., weighing about ten\r\nthousand tons, have ordinarily been pointed to as boulders illustrating\r\nthe power of ice-action. Their glacial character, however, has been\r\nchallenged from the fact that the variety of granite to which they\r\nbelong occurs in the neighbourhood, and indeed constitutes the bed-rock\r\nupon which they rest.[AV] Some would therefore consider them, like some\r\nof which we have already spoken, to be boulders which have originated\r\nthrough the disintegration of great masses of rock, of which these were\r\nharder nuclei that have longer resisted the ravages of the tooth of time.\r\nIt must be admitted that possibly this explanation is correct; but it\r\nis scarcely probable that, in a region where there are so many other\r\nevidences of glacial action, these boulders could have remained immovable\r\nin presence of the onward progress of the ice-current that certainly\r\npassed over them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AV: Popular Science Monthly, vol. xxxvii, pp. 196-201.]\r\n\r\nHowever, as already seen, we are not left to doubt as to the movement\r\nof some boulders of great size. That which now claims the reputation\r\nof being the largest in New England is in Madison, N. H., and measures\r\nthirty by forty by seventy-five feet. This can be traced to ledges of\r\nConway granite, about two miles away.[AW] Many boulders in the vicinity\r\nof New Haven, Conn., can be identified, as from well-known trap-dykes,\r\nsixteen miles or more to the north. The so-called Judge's Cave, on West\r\nRock, 365 feet above the adjoining valley and weighing a thousand tons,\r\nis one of these. Professor Edward Orton[AX] describes a mass of Clinton\r\nlimestone near Freeport, Warren County, Ohio, as covering an area of\r\nthree-fourths of an acre, and as sixteen feet in thickness. It overlies\r\nglacial clays and gravels, and must have been transported bodily from the\r\nelevations containing this rock several miles to the northwest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote AW: See W. 0. Crosby's paper in Appalachia, vol. vi, pp. 59-70.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AX: Geological Survey of Ohio, vol. iii, p. 385,]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Mohegan Rock.]\r\n\r\nPortions of New England present the best illustrations anywhere afforded\r\nin America of what are called \"drumlins.\" These are \"lenticular-shaped\"\r\nhills, composed of till, and containing, interspersed through their mass,\r\nnumerous scratched stones of all sizes. They vary in length from a few\r\nhundred feet to a mile, and are usually from half to two-thirds as wide\r\nas they are long. In height they vary from twenty-five to two hundred\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nBut, according to the description of Mr. Upham, whatever may be their\r\nsize and height, they are singularly alike in outline and form, usually\r\nhaving steep sides, with gently sloping, rounded tops, and presenting a\r\nvery smooth and regular contour. From this resemblance in shape to an\r\nelliptical convex lens, Professor Hitchcock has called them lenticular\r\nhills to distinguish these deposits of till from the broadly flattened or\r\nundulating sheets which are common throughout New England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Drumlins in Goffstown, N. H. (Hitchcock).]\r\n\r\nThe trend, or direction of the longer axis, of these lenticular hills is\r\nnearly the same for all of them comprised within any limited area, and is\r\napproximately like the course of the striæ or glacial furrows marked upon\r\nthe neighbouring ledges. In eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire,\r\nwithin twenty-five miles of the coast, it is quite uniformly to the\r\nsoutheast, or east-southeast. Farther inland, in both of these States,\r\nit is generally from north to south, or a few degrees east of south;\r\nwhile in the valley of the Connecticut River it is frequently a little to\r\nthe west of south. In New Hampshire, besides its accumulation in these\r\nhills, the till is frequently amassed in slopes of similar lenticular\r\nform. These have their position almost invariably upon either the south\r\nor north side of the ledgy hills against which they rest, showing a\r\nconsiderable deflection towards the southeast and northwest in the east\r\npart of the State. It cannot be doubted that the trend of the lenticular\r\nhills, and the direction taken by these slopes, have been determined\r\nby the glacial current, which produced the striæ with which they are\r\nparallel.[AY]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AY: Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History, vol.\r\nxx, pp. 224, 225.]\r\n\r\nDrumlins are abundant in the vicinity of Boston, and constitute nearly\r\nall the islands in Boston Harbour. On the mainland, Beacon Hill, Bunker\r\nHill, Green Hill, Powderhorn Hill, Tufts College Hill, Winter Hill, Mount\r\nIda, Corey Hill, Parker Hill, Wollaston Heights, Prospect Hill, and\r\nTelegraph Hill are specimens.\r\n\r\nThe northeastern corner of Massachusetts and the southeastern corner\r\nof New Hampshire are largely covered with these peculiar-shaped\r\nglacial deposits, while they are numerous as far west as Fitchburg,\r\nin Massachusetts, and Ware, N. H., and in the northeastern part of\r\nConnecticut. A little later, also, we shall refer to an interesting line\r\nof them in central New York. Elsewhere in America, except in a portion of\r\nWisconsin, they rarely occur in such fine development as in New England.\r\nIn Europe they are best developed in portions of Ireland.\r\n\r\nOne's first impression in examining an exposed section of a drumlin\r\nwould lead him to think that the mass was entirely unstratified; but\r\ncloser examination shows that there is a coarse stratification, but\r\nevidently not produced by water-action. The accumulation has probably\r\ntaken place gradually by successive deposits underneath the glacier\r\nitself. Professor William M. Davis has suggested a plausible explanation\r\nwhich we will briefly state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Drumlins in the vicinity of Boston (Davis).]\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which drumlins are found to rest upon a mass of\r\nprojecting rock, the general co-ordination of the direction of their\r\naxes with the direction of the scratches upon the underlying rock, and\r\nthe abundance of scratched stones in them, all support the theory that\r\ndrumlins are formed underneath the ice-sheet, somewhat in the way that\r\nislands and bars of silt are formed in the delta of a great river. The\r\nmovement of ice seems to have been concentrated in pretty definite\r\nlines, often determined by the contour of the bottom, leaving a slacker\r\nmovement in intervening areas, which were evidently protected in some\r\ncases by projecting masses of rock. In these areas of slower movement\r\nthere was naturally an accumulation at the same time that there was\r\nvigorous erosion in the lines of more rapid movement.\r\n\r\nThere was doubtless a continual transfer of material from the end of the\r\ndrumlin which abutted against the moving mass of ice to the lower end,\r\nas there is in the formation of an island in a river. If time enough had\r\nelapsed, the whole accumulation would have been levelled by the glacier\r\nand spread over the broader area where the more rapid lines of movement\r\nbecame confluent, and where the differential motion was less marked.\r\nDrumlins are thus characteristic of areas in the glaciated region whose\r\nfloor was originally only moderately irregular, and where there was an\r\nexcessive amount of ground-moraine to be transported, and where the\r\nmovement did not continue indefinitely. It has been suggested, also,\r\nthat some of the long belts of territory in New England and central New\r\nYork covered by drumlins may represent old terminal moraines which were\r\nsubsequently surmounted by a readvance of the ice, and partially wrought\r\nover into their present shape.\r\n\r\nIt is in New England, also, that kames are to be found in better\r\ndevelopment than anywhere else in America. These interesting remnants of\r\nthe Glacial age are clearly described by Mr. James Geikie. His account\r\nwill serve as well for New England as for Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe sands and gravels have a tendency to shape themselves into mounds\r\nand winding ridges, which give a hummocky and rapidly undulating outline\r\nto the ground. Indeed, so characteristic is this appearance, that by it\r\nalone we are often able to mark out the boundaries of the deposits with\r\nas much precision as we could were all the vegetation and soil stripped\r\naway and the various subsoils laid bare. Occasionally, ridges may be\r\ntracked continuously for several miles, running like great artificial\r\nramparts across the country. These vary in breadth and height, some of\r\nthe more conspicuous ones being upward of four or five hundred feet\r\nbroad at the base, and sloping upward at an angle of twenty-five or even\r\nthirty-five degrees, to a height of sixty feet and more above the general\r\nsurface of the ground. It is most common, however, to find mounds and\r\nridges confusedly intermingled, crossing and recrossing each other at all\r\nangles, so as to enclose deep hollows and pits between. Seen from some\r\ndominant point, such an assemblage of kames, as they are called, looks\r\nlike a tumbled sea--the ground now swelling into long undulations, now\r\nrising suddenly into beautiful peaks and cones, and anon curving up in\r\nsharp ridges that often wheel suddenly round so as to enclose a lakelet\r\nof bright clear water.[AZ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote AZ: The Great Ice Age, pp. 210, 211.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Section of kame near Dover, New Hampshire.\r\nLength, three hundred feet; height, forty feet; base, about forty feet\r\nabove the Cocheco River, or seventy-five feet above the sea. _a_, _a_,\r\ngray clay; _b_, fine sand; _c_, _c_, coarse gravel containing pebbles\r\nfrom six inches to one foot and a half in diameter; _d_, _d_, fine gravel\r\n(Upham).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Kames in Andover Mass.]\r\n\r\nIn New England attention was first directed to kames in 1842, by\r\nPresident Edward Hitchcock, in a paper before the American Association\r\nof Geologists and Naturalists, describing the gravel ridges in Andover,\r\nMass. In the accompanying plate is shown a portion of this kame system,\r\nwhich has a double interest to me from the fact that it was while living\r\nupon the banks of the Shawshin River, near where the kames and the river\r\nintersect, that I began, in 1874, my special study of glacial deposits.\r\nThe Andover ridges are composed of imperfectly stratified water-worn\r\nmaterial, and are very sharply defined, from the town of Chelsea, back\r\nfrom the coast into New Hampshire, for a distance of twenty-five miles.\r\nThe base of the ridges does not maintain a uniform level, but the system\r\ndescends into shallow valleys, and rises over elevations of one hundred\r\nto two hundred feet, without interruption. This indifference to slight\r\nchanges of level is specially noticeable where the system crosses the\r\nMerrimac River, just above the city of Lawrence. It is also represented\r\nin the accompanying plate, where the base of the ridges in the immediate\r\nvalley of the Shawshin is fifty feet lower than the base of those a short\r\ndistance to the north, at the points marked _a_, _b_, and _c_. The ridges\r\nhere terminate at the surface in a sharp angle, and are above their base\r\nforty-one feet at _a_, forty-nine feet at _b_, and ninety-one feet at\r\n_c_. Between _c_ and _b_ there is an extensive peat-swamp, filling the\r\ndepression up to the level of an outlet through which the surplus water\r\nhas found a passage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Longitudinal kames near Hingham, Massachusetts.\r\nThe parallel ridges of gravel in the foreground run nearly east and west,\r\nand coalesce at each end, near the edges of the picture, to form an\r\nelongated kettle-hole. The ridges from fifty to sixty feet in height. The\r\nkame-stream was here evidently emptying into the ocean a few miles to the\r\neast (Bouvé).]\r\n\r\nSeveral systems of kames approximately parallel to this have been\r\ntraced out in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, while the remnants of\r\na very extensive system are found in the Connecticut Valley above the\r\nMassachusetts line. But they abound in greatest profusion in the State\r\nof Maine, where Professor George H. Stone has plotted them with much\r\ncare. The accompanying map gives only an imperfect representation of the\r\nramifying systems which he has traced out, and of the extent to which\r\nthey are independent of the present river-channels. One of the longest\r\nof these extends more than one hundred miles, crossing the Penobscot\r\nRiver nearly opposite Grand Lake, and terminating in an extensive delta\r\nof gravel and sand in Cherryfield, nearly north of Mount Desert. This\r\nis represented on our map by the shaded portion west of the Machias\r\nRiver. Locally these ridges are variously designated as \"horsebacks,\"\r\n\"hogbacks,\" or \"whalebacks,\" but that in Andover, Mass., was for some\r\nreason called \"Indian Ridge.\" Nowhere else in the world are these ridges\r\nbetter developed than in New England, except it be in southern Sweden,\r\nwhere they have long been known and carefully mapped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--The kames of Maine and southeastern New\r\nHampshire. (Stone.)]\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Mr. W. 0. Crosby upon the composition of till in\r\neastern Massachusetts is sufficiently important in its bearings upon the\r\nquestion of glacial erosion to merit notice at this point.[BA] The object\r\nof his investigations was to determine how much of the so-called ground\r\nmoraine, or till, consisted of material disintegrated by mechanical\r\naction, and how much by chemical action. The \"residuary clay,\" which has\r\narisen from chemical decomposition, would properly be attributed to the\r\ndisintegrating agencies of preglacial times, while the clay, which is\r\nstrictly mechanical in its origin, remains to represent the true \"grist\"\r\nor \"rock flour\" of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BA: Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History, vol.\r\nxxv (1890), pp. 115-140.]\r\n\r\nThe results of Mr. Crosby's investigations show that \"not more than\r\none-third of the _detritus_ composing the till of the Boston Basin was in\r\nexistence before the Ice age, and that the remaining two-thirds must be\r\nattributed to the mechanical action of the ice-sheet and its accompanying\r\ntorrents of water. In other words, if we assume the average thickness\r\nof the drift as thirty feet, the amount of glacial erosion can scarcely\r\nfall below twenty feet. After scraping away the residuary clays and\r\nhalf-decomposed material, the ice-sheet has cut more than an equal depth\r\ninto the solid rocks.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Crosby's investigations also convinced him that the movement of the\r\ntill, or ground moraine, underneath the ice was not _en masse_, but that\r\n\"it must have experienced differential horizontal movements or flowing,\r\nin which, normally, every particle or fragment slipped or was squeezed\r\nforward with reference to those immediately below it, the velocity\r\ndiminishing downward through the friction of the underlying ledges....\r\nThe glaciation was not limited to masses which were firmly caught between\r\nthe ice and the solid ledges, and it was in every case essentially a\r\nslipping and not a rolling movement.... These differential horizontal\r\nmovements mean that the till acted as a lubricant for the ice-sheet;\r\nand the clayey element, especially, co-operating in many cases with the\r\npent-up subglacial waters, must have greatly facilitated the onward\r\nprogress of the ice.\" He concludes, therefore, that the onward movement\r\nof the vast ice-sheet greatly exceeded that of the main part of the\r\nground moraine, the ice-sheet slipping over the till, the whole being\r\nin some degree analogous to that of a great land-slip. \"In both cases\r\nthe progress of a somewhat yielding and mobile mass is facilitated by an\r\nunderlying clayey layer saturated with water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania._\r\n\r\nWest of New England the glacial phenomena over the northern part of the\r\nUnited States are equally marked all the way to the Missouri River, and\r\nthe boundary-line of the glaciated region can be traced with little\r\ndifficulty. It emerges from New York Bay on Staten Island and enters New\r\nJersey at Perth Amboy. A well-formed moraine covers the northern part\r\nof Staten Island, and upon the mainland marks the boundary from Perth\r\nAmboy, around through Raritan, Plainfield, Chatham, Morris, and Hanover,\r\nto Rockaway, and thence in a southwesterly direction to Belvidere, on\r\nthe Delaware River. That portion of New Jersey lying north of this\r\nserpentine line of moraine hills is characterised by the presence of\r\ntransported boulders, by numerous lakes of evident glacial origin, and by\r\nevery other sign of glacial action, while south of it all these peculiar\r\ncharacteristics are absent. The observant passenger upon the railroad\r\ntrains between New York and Philadelphia can easily recognise the\r\nmoraine as it is passed through on the Pennsylvania Railroad at Metuchen\r\nand on the Bound Brook Railroad at Plainfield. Near Drakestown, in\r\nMorris County, there is a mass of blue limestone measuring, as exposed,\r\nthirty-six by thirty feet, and which was quarried for years before\r\ndiscovering that it was a boulder brought with other drift material from\r\nmany miles to the northwest and lodged here a thousand feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nAcross Pennsylvania the glacial boundary passes through Northampton,\r\nMonroe, Luzerne, Columbia, Sullivan, Lycoming, Tioga, and Potter\r\nCounties, where it enters the State of New York, running still in a\r\nnorthwest direction through Allegany and Cattaraugus Counties to the\r\nvicinity of Salamanca. Here it turns to the south nearly at a right\r\nangle, running southwestward to Chautauqua County and re-entering\r\nPennsylvania in Warren County, and thence passing onward in the same\r\ngeneral direction through Crawford, Venango, Mercer, Butler, and Lawrence\r\nCounties to the Ohio line in Columbiana County, about ten miles north of\r\nthe Ohio River.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of a well-defined terminal moraine to mark the glacial\r\nboundary eastward from Pennsylvania led Professor Lewis and myself, who\r\nmade the survey of that State in 1880, to be rather too sanguine in\r\nour expectations of finding an equally well-marked moraine everywhere\r\nalong the southern margin of the glaciated area; still, the results are\r\neven more interesting than would have been the exact fulfilment of our\r\nexpectations, since they more fully revealed to us the great complexity\r\nof effect which is capable of being brought about by ice-action. Before\r\nproceeding farther with the details, therefore, it will be profitable\r\nat this point to pause in the narrative and briefly record a few\r\ngeneralisations that have forced themselves into prominence during the\r\nyears in which field-work has been in progress.\r\n\r\nPrevious to our explorations in Pennsylvania it had been thought that the\r\nindications of ice-action would extend much farther south in the valleys\r\nthan on the mountains, and this indeed would have been the case if the\r\nglaciers in northern Pennsylvania had been of local origin; but our\r\nexperience very soon demonstrated that the great gathering-place of the\r\nsnows which produced the glacial movement in northern Pennsylvania could\r\nnot have been local, but that over the northern part of that State there\r\nwas distinct evidence of a continental movement of ice whose centre was\r\nfar beyond the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\nFor example, we found that the evidences of direct glacial action\r\nextended farther south upon the hills and plateaus than they did in the\r\nnarrow valleys, while everywhere on the very southern border of glacial\r\nindications we found boulders that had been brought from the granitic\r\nregion of northern New York or central Canada. In eastern Pennsylvania\r\nwe found indeed a terminal moraine more or less distinctly marking the\r\nsouthern border over the highlands. This was more specially true in\r\nNorthampton and Monroe Counties.\r\n\r\nIn Northampton County it was very interesting to see long lines of hills,\r\na hundred or more feet in height and lying several hundred feet above\r\nthe Delaware River, composed entirely of glacial _débris_, much of which\r\nhad been brought bodily over the sharp summit of the Blue Ridge, or\r\nKittatinny Mountain, which rises as a continuous wall to the northwest\r\nand is everywhere several hundred feet higher than the moraine in\r\nNorthampton County. The summit of Blue Ridge, also, as far south as the\r\nglacial movement extended, shows evident signs of glacial abrasion, some\r\nhundreds of feet evidently having been removed by that means, leaving a\r\nwell-defined shoulder, marking the limits of its southwestern border.\r\nResting upon the summit of the glaciated portion of the Blue Ridge, there\r\nare also numerous boulders of Helderberg limestone, which must have been\r\nbrought from ledges at least five hundred feet lower than the places upon\r\nwhich they now lie.\r\n\r\nIn Monroe County the terminal moraine marking there the extreme limit\r\nof the ice-movement is upon an extensive plateau of Pocono sandstone,\r\nabout eighteen hundred feet above sea-level, and five or six hundred\r\nfeet lower than the crest of the Alleghany Mountains, a short distance\r\nto the north. The moraine hills are here well marked by the occurrence\r\nof circular lakelets and kettle-holes (such as have been described\r\nas characteristic of the shores and islands bordering the south of\r\nNew England); by the occurrence of granitic boulders, which must have\r\nbeen brought from the Adirondacks or Canada; and by the various other\r\nindications referred to on a previous page.\r\n\r\nAs already intimated, the instructive point in our observations is the\r\nfact that, between Kittatinny Mountain, in Northampton County, and Pocono\r\nplateau, in Monroe County, there is a longitudinal depression, running\r\nnortheast by southwest, parallel with the ranges of the mountain system,\r\nwhich is here about a thousand feet below the respective ridges on either\r\nside. This, therefore, is one of the places where we should have expected\r\na considerable southern extension of the ice, if it had been largely due\r\nto local causes. Now, while there is indeed a gradual southern trend down\r\nthe flanks of the mountain, yet, upon reaching the axis of the valley,\r\nthere appears at once a very marked change in the character of the\r\ndeposit, and the influence of powerful streams of water becomes manifest,\r\nand it is evident, upon a slight inspection, that we have come upon a\r\nline of drainage which sustained a peculiar relation to the continental\r\nice-sheet.\r\n\r\nFrom Stroudsburg, near the Delaware Water-Gap, to Weissport, on the\r\nLehigh River, a distance of about thirty miles, the valley between the\r\nmountains is continuous, and the elevation at each end very nearly the\r\nsame. But about half-way between the two places, near Saylorsburg, there\r\nis a river-parting from which the water now runs on the one hand north\r\nto Stroudsburg, and thence to the Delaware River, and on the other hand\r\nsouth, through Big and Aquonchichola Creeks, to the Lehigh River. The\r\nriver-parting is formed by a great accumulation of gravel, whose summit\r\nis about two hundred feet above the level of the valleys into which\r\nthe creeks empty at either end; and there are numerous kettle-holes and\r\nlakelets in the vicinity, such as characterize the glacial region in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nIn short, we are, without doubt, here on a well-marked terminal moraine\r\nmuch modified by strong water-action in a valley of glacial drainage.\r\nThe gravel and boulders are all well water-worn, and the material is of\r\nvarious kinds, including granite boulders from the far north, such as\r\ncharacterise the terminal moraine on the highlands; but the pebbles are\r\nnot scratched, and the gravel is more or less stratified. It is evident\r\nthat we are here where a violent stream of water poured forth from that\r\nportion of the ice-front which filled this valley, and which found its\r\nonly outlet in the direction of the Lehigh River. The gravel can be\r\ntraced in diminishing quantities to the southward, in accordance with\r\nthis theory, while to the northward there extends a series of gravel\r\nridges, or kames, such as we have shown naturally to owe their origin to\r\nthe accumulations taking place in ice-channels formed near the front of a\r\nglacier as it slowly melts away.\r\n\r\nFrom similar occurrences of vast gravel accumulations in other valleys\r\nstretching southward from the glacial margin, we came to expect that,\r\nwherever there was an open, line of drainage from the glaciated region\r\nsouthward, the point of intersection between the glacial margin and\r\nthe drainage valley would be marked by an excessive accumulation of\r\nwater-worn gravel, diminishing in coarseness and abundance down the\r\nvalleys in proportion to the distance from the glacial margin.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Delaware River emerges from the glaciated region at\r\nBelvidere, and there are there vast accumulations of gravel rising a\r\nhundred or more feet above the present level of the river, while gravel\r\nterraces, diminishing in height, mark the river below to tide-water at\r\nTrenton. The Lehigh River leaves the glaciated region at Hickory Run, a\r\nfew miles above Mauch Chunk, but the gorge is so steep that there was\r\nlittle opportunity either for the accumulation of gravel there or for its\r\npreservation. Still, the transported gravel and boulders characteristic\r\nof the melting floods pouring forth from a glacier, are found lining the\r\nbanks of the Lehigh all along the lower portion of its course. In the\r\nSusquehanna River we have a better example at Beach Haven, in Luzerne\r\nCounty, where there are very extensive accumulations of gravel resting\r\non the true glacial deposits of the valley, and extending down the river\r\nin terraces of regularly diminishing height for many miles, and merging\r\ninto terraces of moderate elevation which line the Susquehanna Valley\r\nthroughout the rest of its course. Above Beach Haven the gravel deposits\r\nin the trough of the river valley are more irregular, and betray the\r\nmodifying influence of the slowly decaying masses of ice which belonged\r\nto the enveloping continental glacier.\r\n\r\nWestward from the north fork of the Susquehanna, similar extensive\r\naccumulations of gravel occur at the intersection of Fishing Creek in\r\nColumbia County, Muncy, Loyalsock, Lycoming, and Pine Creeks in Lycoming\r\nCounty, all tributary to the Susquehanna River, and all evidently being\r\nchannels through which the melting floods of the ice-sheet brought\r\nvast quantities of gravel down to the main stream. Williamsport, on\r\nthe West Branch of the Susquehanna, is built upon an extensive terrace\r\ncontaining much granitic material, brought down from the glaciated region\r\nby Lycoming Creek, when it was flooded with the waters melted from the\r\ncontinental ice-sheet which had here surmounted the Alleghanies and\r\ninvaded the valley of the Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nAnalogous deposits of unusual amounts of gravel, occurring in streams\r\nflowing southward from the glaciated region, occur at Great Valley,\r\nLittle Valley, and Steamburg in Cattaraugus County, New York, and\r\nat Russelburg and Garland in Warren County, Pennsylvania, also at\r\nTitusville and Franklin in Venango County, and at Wampum in Lawrence\r\nCounty, of the same State.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, Professor Lewis and myself found it more difficult to\r\ndetermine with accuracy the exact point to which the ice extended in\r\nthe axis of these south-flowing valleys than we did upon the highlands\r\nupon either side; and, in looking for the positive indications of direct\r\nice-action in these lines of drainage, we were almost always led up\r\nthe valley to a considerable distance inside of the line. This arose\r\nfrom our inexperience in interpreting the phenomena, or rather from\r\nour inattention to the well-known determining facts in the problem. On\r\nfurther reflection it readily appeared that this was as it should be. The\r\nice-front, instead of extending farther down in a narrow valley than on\r\nthe adjoining highlands (where they are of only moderate elevation) ought\r\nnot to extend so far, for the subglacial streams would not only wear away\r\nthe ice of themselves, but would admit the air into the tunnels formed by\r\nthem so as to melt the masses both from below and from above, and thus\r\ncause a recession of the front. If we had understood this principle at\r\nthe beginning of our survey, it would have saved us much perplexity and\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nA single further illustration of this point will help to an understanding\r\nof many references which will hereafter be made to the water deposits\r\nwhich accumulated in the lines of drainage running southward from the\r\nglaciated area. At Warren, Pa., Conewango Creek, which is the outlet\r\nfrom Chautauqua Lake, enters the Alleghany River after flowing for a\r\nnumber of miles in a deep valley with moderate slopes. In ascending the\r\ncreek from Warren, the gravel terraces, which rise twenty-five or thirty\r\nfeet above high-water mark, rapidly increase in breadth and height, and\r\nthe pebbles become more and more coarse. After a certain distance the\r\nregular terraces begin to give place to irregular accumulations of gravel\r\nin ridges and knobs. In the lower portion of the valley no pebbles\r\ncould be found which were scratched. Up the valley a few miles pebbles\r\nwere occasionally discovered which showed some slight indications of\r\nhaving been scratched, but which had been subjected to such an amount of\r\nabrasion by water-action as almost to erase the scratches. On reaching\r\nAckley's Station, the stream is found to be cutting through a regular\r\nterminal moraine, extending across the valley and full of clearly marked\r\nglaciated stones. Above this terminal moraine the terraces and gravel\r\nridges which had characterised the valley below disappear, giving place\r\nto long stretches of level and swampy land, which had been subject to\r\noverflow.\r\n\r\nSomething similar to this so often appears, that there can be no\r\nquestion as to its meaning, which is, that during the farthest extent\r\nof the ice the front rested for a considerable period of time along the\r\nline marked by the terminal moraine. During this period there occurred\r\nboth the accumulation of the moraine and of the gravel terraces in the\r\nvalley below, due to the vast flow of water emerging from the ice-front,\r\nespecially during the period when it was most rapidly melting away. Upon\r\nthe retreat of the ice, the moraine constituted a dam which has not yet\r\nbeen wholly worn away. For a while the water was so effectually ponded\r\nback by this as to form a lake, which has since become filled up with\r\nsediment and accumulations of peat. From this it is evident, also, that\r\nwhen the ice began to retreat, the retreat was so continuous and rapid\r\nthat no parallel terminal moraines were formed for many miles.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this section we will summarise the leading facts\r\nconcerning the glacial phenomena north of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\r\nFrom the observations of Professor Smock, it appears that, from the\r\nsouthern margin the ascent to the summit of the ice-sheet was pretty\r\nrapid; the depth one mile back from the margin being not much less\r\nthan a thousand feet. \"Northward the angle of the slope diminished, and\r\nthe glacier surface approximated to a great level plain. The distance\r\nbetween the high southwestern peaks of the Catskills and Pocono Knob\r\nin Pennsylvania is sixty miles. The difference in the elevation of the\r\nglacier could not have exceeded a thousand feet,\"[BB] that is, the slope\r\nof the surface was about seventeen feet to the mile.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BB: American Journal of Science, vol. cxxv, 1883, p. 339 _et\r\nseq._]\r\n\r\nProfessor Dana estimates the thickness of the ice in southern Connecticut\r\nto have been between fifteen hundred and two thousand feet. Attempts to\r\ncalculate the thickness of the ice farther north, except from actual\r\ndiscovery of glacial action on the summits of the mountains, are based\r\nupon uncertain data with reference to the slope necessary to secure\r\nglacial movement. In the Alps the lowest mean slopes down which glaciers\r\nmove are about two hundred and fifty feet to a mile; but in Greenland,\r\nJensen found the slope of the Frederickshaab Glacier to be only\r\nseventy-five feet to the mile, while Helland found that of the Jakobshavn\r\nGlacier to be only forty-five feet.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if even that amount is necessary to secure a continental\r\nmovement of ice, since, as already remarked, it is unsafe to draw\r\ninferences concerning the movements of large masses of ice from those of\r\nsmaller masses in more constricted areas. We have seen, from the glacial\r\ndeposits on the top of Mount Washington, that over the northern part of\r\nNew England the ice was more than a mile in depth. We have no direct\r\nevidence of the depth of the stream which surrounded the Adirondack\r\nMountains. Nor, on the other hand, are we certain that the Catskills\r\nwere not completely enveloped in ice, though most observers, reasoning\r\nfrom negative evidence, have supposed that to be the case. But from the\r\nfacts stated concerning the boulders along the glacial boundary in\r\nPennsylvania, it is certain that the ice was deep enough to surmount\r\nthe ridge of the Alleghanies where they are two thousand and more feet\r\nin height. At the least calculation the ice must have been five hundred\r\nfeet thick, in order to secure the movement of which there is evidence\r\nacross the Appalachian range. Supposing this to be the height of the ice\r\nabove the sea on the crest of the Alleghanies, and that the slope of the\r\nsurface of the ice-sheet was as moderate as Professor Smock has estimated\r\nit (namely seventeen feet to the mile), the ice would be upwards of\r\nsix thousand feet in thickness in the latitude of the Adirondacks,\r\nwhich corresponds closely with the positive evidence Ave have from the\r\nmountains in New England.\r\n\r\nA study of the map of New York will make it easy to understand the\r\ndistribution of some interesting glacial marks over the State. The\r\ndistance along the Hudson from the glacial boundary in the vicinity of\r\nNew York to the valley of the Mohawk is about one hundred and sixty\r\nmiles. Prom the glacial boundary at Salamanca, N. Y., to the same valley,\r\nis not over eighty miles. It is easy to see, therefore, that when, in\r\nadvancing, the ice moved southward past the Adirondacks, the east end\r\nof the valley of the Mohawk was reached and closed by the ice, while at\r\nthe west end of Lake Ontario the ice-front was still in Canada. Thus the\r\ndrainage, which naturally followed the course of the St. Lawrence, would\r\nfirst be turned through the Mohawk. Afterwards, when the Mohawk had been\r\nclosed by ice, the vast amount of ponded water was compelled to seek a\r\ntemporary outlet over the lower passages leading into the Susquehanna or\r\ninto the Alleghany.\r\n\r\nA number of such passages exist. One can be traced along the line of the\r\nold canal from Utica to Binghamton, whose highest level is not far from\r\neleven hundred feet. Another lies in a valley leading south of Cayuga\r\nLake, whose highest point, at Wilseyville, is nine hundred and forty\r\nfeet above tide. Another leads south to the Chemung River from Seneca\r\nLake, whose highest point, at Horseheads, is less than nine hundred feet\r\nabove tide. The cols farther west are somewhat more elevated; the one at\r\nPortage, leading from the Genesee River into the Canisteo, being upwards\r\nof thirteen hundred feet, and that of Dayton, leading from Cattaraugus\r\nCreek into the Conewango, being about the same. Of other southern outlets\r\nfarther west we will speak later on.\r\n\r\nFixing our minds now upon the region under consideration, in the southern\r\npart of the State of New York, we can readily see that a glacial lake\r\nmust have existed in front of the ice while it was advancing, until it\r\nhad reached the river-partings between the Mohawk and the St. Lawrence\r\nRivers on the north and the Susquehanna and Alleghany Rivers on the\r\nsouth. After the ice had attained its maximum extension, and was in\r\nprocess of retreat, there would be a repetition of the phenomena, only\r\nthey would occur in the reverse order. The glacial markings which we see\r\nare, of course, mainly those produced during the general retreat of the\r\nice.\r\n\r\nThe Susquehanna River stretching out its arms--the Chenango and Chemung\r\nRivers--to the east and the west, evidently serves as a line of drainage\r\nfor the vast glacial floods. These floods have left, along their courses,\r\nextensive elevated gravel terraces, with much material in them which\r\nis not local, but which has been washed out of the direct glacial\r\ndeposits from the far north. The east-and-west line of the water-parting\r\nthroughout the State is characterised by excessive accumulations of\r\nglaciated material, forming something like a terminal moraine, and is\r\ndesignated by President Chamberlin as \"the terminal moraine of the second\r\nGlacial epoch,\" corresponding, as he thinks, to the interior line already\r\ndescribed as characterising the south shore of New England.\r\n\r\nIn the central part of New York the remarkable series of \"Finger Lakes,\"\r\ntributary to Lake Ontario and emptying into it through the Oswego and\r\nGenesee Rivers, all have a glacial origin. Probably, however, they are\r\nnot due in any great degree to glacial erosion, but they seem to occupy\r\nnorth-and-south valleys which had been largely formed by streams running\r\ntowards the St. Lawrence when there was, by some means (probably through\r\nthe Mohawk River), a much deeper outlet than now exists, but which has\r\nbeen filled up and obliterated by glacial _débris_. The ice-movement\r\nnaturally centred itself more or less in these north-and-south valleys,\r\nand hence somewhat enlarged them, but probably did not deepen them. The\r\nice, however, did prevent them from becoming filled with sediment, and on\r\nits final retreat gave place to water.\r\n\r\nBetween these lakes and Lake Ontario, also, and extending east and west\r\nnearly all the way from Syracuse to Rochester, there is a remarkable\r\nseries of hills, from one hundred to two or three hundred feet in height,\r\ncomposed of glacial _débris_. But while the range extends east and west,\r\nthe axis of the individual hills lies nearly north and south. These are\r\nprobably remnants of a morainic accumulation which were made during\r\na pause in the first advance of the ice, and were finally sculptured\r\ninto their present shape by the onward movement of the ice. These are\r\nreally \"drumlins,\" similar to those already described in northeastern\r\nMassachusetts and southeastern New Hampshire. In the valley of central\r\nNew York these have determined the lines of drainage of the \"Finger\r\nLakes,\" and formed dams across the natural outlets of nearly all of them.\r\n\r\nNorth of the State of New York the innumerable lakes in Canada are all\r\nof glacial origin, being mostly due to depressions of the nature of\r\nkettle-holes, or to the damming up of old outlets by glacial deposits. A\r\npretty well-marked line of moraine hills, formed probably as terminal\r\ndeposits in the later stages of the Ice age, runs from near the eastern\r\nend of Lake Ontario to the Georgian Bay, passing south of Lake Simcoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mississippi Basin._\r\n\r\nThe physical geography of the glaciated region north of the Ohio River is\r\nso much simpler than that of New England and the Middle States, that its\r\ncharacteristics can be briefly stated. Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois are\r\ncovered with nearly parallel strata of rock mostly of the Carboniferous\r\nage. In general, the surface slopes gently to the west; the average\r\nelevation of Ohio being about a thousand feet above tide, while that of\r\nthe Great Lakes to the north and of the middle portion of the Mississippi\r\nValley is less than six hundred feet. The glacial deposits are spread in\r\na pretty even sheet over the area which was reached by the ice in these\r\nStates, and the lines of moraine, of which a dozen or more have been\r\npartially traced in receding order, are much less clearly marked than\r\nthey are in New England, or in Michigan, and the States farther to the\r\nnorthwest.\r\n\r\nThe line marking the southern limit attained by the ice of the Glacial\r\nperiod in these three States is as follows: Entering Ohio in Columbiana\r\nCounty, about ten miles north of the Ohio River, the glacial boundary\r\nruns westward through New Lisbon to Canton in Stark County, and thence\r\nto Millersburg in Holmes County. A few miles west of this place it\r\nturns abruptly south, passing through Danville in Knox County, Newark\r\nin Licking County, Lancaster in Fairfield County, to Adelphi in Ross\r\nCounty. Thence bearing more westward it passes through Chillicothe\r\nto southeastern Highland County and northwestern Adams, reaching the\r\nOhio River near Ripley, in Clermont County. Thence, following the\r\nnorth bank of the Ohio River to Cincinnati, it crosses the river, and\r\nafter extending through the northern part of Boone County, Kentucky,\r\nand recrossing the river to Indiana, not far from Rising Sun, it again\r\nfollows approximately the north bank of the river to within about ten\r\nmiles of Louisville, Ky., where it bends northward running through\r\nClarke, Scott, Jackson, Bartholomew, and Brown Counties to Martinsville,\r\nin Morgan County, where it turns again west and south and follows\r\napproximately the West Branch of the White River through Owen, Greene,\r\nand Knox Counties, where it crosses the main stream of White River, and,\r\ncontinuing through Gibson and Posey Counties, crosses the Wabash River\r\nnear New Harmony.\r\n\r\nIn Illinois the line still continues southwesterly through White,\r\nGallatin, Saline, and Williamson Counties, where it reaches its southern\r\nlimit near Carbondale, in latitude 37° 40', and from this point trends\r\nnorthwestward, approximately following the northeastern bluff of the\r\nMississippi River, to the vicinity of Carondelet, Mo., a short distance\r\nsouth of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Mississippi the line follows approximately the course of the\r\nMissouri River across Missouri, and continues westward to the vicinity of\r\nManhattan, in Kansas, where it turns northward, keeping about a hundred\r\nmiles west of the Missouri River, through eastern Kansas and Nebraska,\r\nand striking the river near the mouth of the Niobrara, in South Dakota.\r\nFrom there the line follows approximately the course of the Missouri\r\nRiver to the vicinity of Fort Benton, in northwestern Montana, where the\r\nline again bears more northward, running into British America.\r\n\r\nIt is still in dispute whether the ice extended from the eastern centre\r\nfar enough west to join the ice-movement from the Rocky Mountain\r\nplateau. Dr. George M. Dawson[BC] is of the opinion that it did not, but\r\nthat there was a belt of a hundred miles or more, east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, which was never covered by true glacial ice. Mr. Upham[BD]\r\nis equally confident that the two ice-movements became confluent,\r\nand united upon the western plateau of Manitoba. The opportunity\r\nfor such a difference of opinion arises in the difficulty sometimes\r\nencountered of distinguishing between a direct glacial deposit and a\r\ndeposit taking place in water containing boulder-laden icebergs. Where\r\nMr. Upham supposes the ice-fields of the east and of the west to have\r\nbeen confluent in western Manitoba, Dr. Dawson supposes there was an\r\nextensive subsidence of the land sufficient to admit the waters of the\r\nocean. Leaving this question for the present undetermined, we will now\r\nrapidly summarise the glacial phenomena west of the third meridian\r\nfrom Washington (which corresponds nearly with the western boundary of\r\nPennsylvania), and east of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BC: Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, vol. viii,\r\nsec. iv, pp. 54-74.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BD: American Geologist, vol. vi, September, 1890; Bulletin of\r\nthe Geological Society of America, vol. ii, pp. 243-276.]\r\n\r\nThat the glacial movement extended to the southern boundary just\r\ndelineated is established by the presence down to that line of all the\r\nsigns of glacial action, and their absence beyond. Glacial groovings are\r\nfound upon the freshly uncovered rock surfaces at frequent intervals in\r\nclose proximity to the line all along its course, while granitic boulders\r\nfrom the far north are scattered, with more or less regularity, over the\r\nwhole intervening space between this line and the Canadian highlands.\r\nI have already referred to a boulder of jasper conglomerate found in\r\nBoone County, Kentucky, which must have come from unique outcroppings of\r\nthis rock north of Lake Huron. Granitic boulders from the Lake Superior\r\nregion are also found in great abundance at the extreme margin mentioned\r\nin southern Illinois. West of the Missouri River it is somewhat more\r\ndifficult to delineate the boundary with accuracy, on account of an\r\nenveloping deposit of fine loam, technically called \"loess.\" Loess is\r\nvery abundant in the whole valley of the Missouri River below Yankton,\r\nSouth Dakota, being for a long distance in the vicinity of the river\r\na hundred feet or more in depth. Over northern Missouri and southern\r\nIllinois the deposit is nearly continuous, but less in depth, and\r\neverywhere in that region tends to hide from view the unstratified\r\nglacial deposit continuously underlying it.\r\n\r\nA single instance of personal experience will illustrate the condition of\r\nthings. While going south from Chicago, in search of the southern limit\r\nof glacial action, I stopped off from the train at Du Quoin, about forty\r\nmiles north of where I subsequently found the boundary. Here the whole\r\nsurface was covered with loess, two or three feet in depth. Below this\r\nwas a gravelly soil, three or four feet in thickness, which contained\r\nmany scratched pebbles of granite. A well which had recently been dug,\r\nreached the rock at a depth of twenty feet, and revealed a beautifully\r\npolished and scratched surface, betraying, beyond question, the action\r\nof glacial ice. As we shall show a little later, it is probable that,\r\nabout the time the ice of the Glacial period had reached its maximum\r\ndevelopment, this area, which is covered with loess, was depressed in\r\nlevel, and remained under water during a considerable portion of the\r\nperiod when the ice-front was retreating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Western face of the kettle-moraine, near Eagle,\r\nWaukesha County, Wisconsin. (From a photograph by President T. C.\r\nChamberlain, United States Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nTo such an extent is this portion of the area included in southern\r\nIowa, northern Missouri, southern Illinois, and the extreme southern\r\nportions of Indiana and Ohio covered with loess, that it has been\r\ndifficult to determine the relation of its underlying glacial deposits\r\nto the more irregular deposits found farther north. At an early period\r\nof recent investigations, while making a geological survey of the State\r\nof Wisconsin, President T. C. Chamberlin fixed upon the line of moraine\r\nhills, which can be seen upon our map, running southward between Green\r\nBay and Lake Michigan, and sweeping around in a curve to the right,\r\npassing south of Madison and northward along the line of Wisconsin\r\nRiver, and in another curve to the left, around the southern end of Lake\r\nMichigan, as the \"terminal moraine of the second Glacial epoch.\" In\r\nWisconsin the character of this line of moraine hills had been discovered\r\nand described by Colonel Charles Whittlesey, in 1866. It was first\r\nnamed the \"kettle-moraine,\" because of the frequent occurrence in it of\r\n\"kettle-holes.\" This line of moraine hills has been traced with a great\r\ndegree of confidence across the entire glaciated area, as shown upon our\r\nmap, but it is not everywhere equally distinct, and, as will be observed,\r\nfollows a very irregular course.\r\n\r\nBeginning in Ohio we find it coinciding nearly with the extreme glacial\r\nboundary until it reaches the valley of the Scioto River, on the sixth\r\nmeridian west from Washington, where it begins to bear northward and\r\ncontinues in that direction for a distance of sixty or seventy miles,\r\nand then turns southward again in the valley of the Miami, having formed\r\nbetween these two valleys a sort of medial moraine.[BE] A similar medial\r\nmoraine had also been noted by President Chamberlin between the valleys\r\nof the Grand and Cuyahoga Rivers, in the eastern part of Ohio. Indeed,\r\nfor the whole distance across Ohio and Indiana, this moraine occurs in a\r\nseries of loops pointing to the south, corresponding in general to the\r\nfive gentle valleys which mark the territory, namely, those of the Grand\r\nand Mahoning Rivers; the Sandusky and Scioto Rivers; the Great Miami\r\nRiver; the White River; and the Maumee and Wabash Rivers. Everywhere,\r\nhowever, over this area these morainic accumulations approximate pretty\r\nclosely to the extreme boundary of the glaciated region.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BE: See map at the beginning of the chapter.]\r\n\r\nIn Illinois President Chamberlin's original determination of the moraine\r\nfixed it near the southern end of Lake Michigan, as shown upon our map,\r\nbut Mr. Frank Leverett has subsequently demonstrated that there is a\r\nconcentric series of moraines south of this, reaching across the State,\r\n(but somewhat obscured by superficial accumulations of loess referred to)\r\nand extending nearly to the latitude of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nWest of Wisconsin President Chamberlin's \"terminal moraine of the second\r\nGlacial epoch\" bends southward through eastern Minnesota, and, sweeping\r\ndown through central Iowa, forms, near the middle of the northern part\r\nof that State, a loop, having its southern extremity in the vicinity of\r\nDes Moines. The western arm of this loop runs through Minnesota in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction nearly parallel with the upper portion of the\r\nvalley of the Minnesota, until reaching the latitude of the head-waters\r\nof that river, where, in the vicinity of the Sisseton Agency, in Dakota,\r\nit turns to the south by an acute angle, and makes a loop in that State,\r\nextending to the vicinity of Yankton, and with the valley of the James\r\nRiver as its axis. The western arm of this loop follows pretty closely\r\nthe line of the eastern edge of the trough of the Missouri River,\r\nconstituting what is called the \"Missouri Coteau,\" which continues on as\r\na well-marked line of hills running in a northwesterly direction far up\r\ninto the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nOne of the most puzzling glacial phenomena in the Mississippi Valley is\r\nthe driftless area which occupies the southeastern portion of Minnesota,\r\nthe southwestern part of Wisconsin, and the northwestern corner of Iowa,\r\nas delineated upon our map. This is an area which, while being surrounded\r\non every side by all the characteristic marks of glaciation, is itself\r\nconspicuous for their entire absence. Its rocks preserve no glacial\r\nscratches and are covered by no deposits of till, while northern boulders\r\navoided it in their journey to more southern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe reason for all this is not evident in the topography of the region.\r\nThe land is not higher than that to the north of it, nor is there any\r\nmanifest protection to it by the highlands south of Lake Superior. Nor\r\nyet is there any reason to suppose that any extensive changes of level in\r\nformer times seriously affected its relations to the surrounding country.\r\nProfessor Dana, however, has called attention to the fact that even now\r\nit is in a region of comparatively light precipitation, suggesting that\r\nthe snow-fall over it may always have been insignificant in amount. But\r\nthis could scarcely account for the failure of the great ice-wave of the\r\nnorth to overrun it. We are indebted again to the sagacity of President\r\nChamberlin in suggesting the true explanation.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the map it will be noticed that this area sustains a\r\npeculiar relation to the troughs of Lake Michigan and Lake Superior,\r\nwhile from the arrangements of the moraines in front of these lakes it\r\nwill be seen that these lake basins were prominent factors in determining\r\nthe direction of the movement of the surplus ice from the north. It is\r\nthe more natural that they should do so because of their great depth,\r\ntheir bottoms being in both cases several hundred feet below the present\r\nwater-level, reaching even below the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nThese broad, deep channels seem to have furnished the readiest outlet for\r\nthe surplus ice of the North, and so to have carried both currents of ice\r\nbeyond this driftless area before they became again confluent. The slight\r\nelevation south of Lake Superior served to protect the area on account of\r\nthe feebleness of direct movement made possible by the strength of these\r\ndiverging lateral ice-currents. The phenomenon is almost exactly what\r\noccurs where a slight obstruction in a river causes an eddy and preserves\r\na low portion of land below it from submergence. A glance at the map\r\nwill make it easily credible that an ice-movement south of Manitoba,\r\nbecoming confluent with one from Lake Superior, pushed far down into the\r\nMissouri Valley and spread eastward to the Mississippi River, south of\r\nthe unglaciated driftless area, and there became confluent with a similar\r\nmovement which had been directed by the valleys of Lake Michigan and Lake\r\nErie. There can be little doubt that President Chamberlin's explanation\r\nis in the main correct, and we have in this another illustration of the\r\nanalogy between the behaviour of moving ice and that of moving water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Section of the east-and-west glacial furrows,\r\non Kelly's Island, preserved by Mr. Younglove. Fine sediment rests\r\nimmediately on the rock, with washed pebbles at the surface.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustrations will give a better idea than words can\r\ndo of the celebrated glacial grooves on the hard limestone islands\r\nnear Sandusky, in the western part of Lake Erie. Through the interest\r\naroused in them by an excursion of the American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, while meeting in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1888, the\r\nKelly Island Lime and Transport Company, of which Mr. M. C. Younglove is\r\nthe president, has been induced to deed to the Western Reserve Historical\r\nSociety for preservation a portion of one of the most remarkable of the\r\ngrooves still remaining.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the groove preserved is thirty-three feet across, and\r\nthe depth of the cut in the rock is seventeen feet below the line,\r\nextending from rim to rim. Originally there was probably here a small\r\ndepression formed by preglacial water erosion, into which the ice crowded\r\nthe material, which became its graving-tool, and so the rasping and\r\npolishing went on in increasing degree until this enormous furrow is\r\nthe result. The groove, however, is by no means simple, but presents a\r\nseries of corrugations merging into each other by beautiful curves. When\r\nexposed for a considerable length it will resemble nothing else so much\r\nas a collection of prostrate Corinthian columns lying side by side on a\r\nconcave surface.\r\n\r\nThe direction of these grooves is a little south of west, corresponding\r\nto that of the axis of the lake. This is nearly at right angles to the\r\ncourse of the ice-scratches on the summit of the water-shed south of\r\nthis, between the lake and the Ohio River. The reason for this change\r\nof direction can readily be seen by a little attention to the physical\r\ngeography. The highlands to the south of the lake rise about seven\r\nhundred feet above it. When the Ice period was at its climax and overran\r\nthese highlands, the ice took its natural course at right angles to\r\nthe terminal moraine and flowed southeast according to the direction\r\nindicated by the scratches on the summit; but when the supply of ice was\r\nnot sufficient to overrun the highlands, the obstruction in front turned\r\nthe course and the resultant was a motion towards Toledo and the Maumee\r\nValley, where in the vicinity of Fort Wayne an extensive terminal moraine\r\nwas formed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Same as the preceding. (Courtesy of M. C.\r\nYounglove.)]\r\n\r\nThe much-mooted question of a succession of glacial epochs finds the\r\nmost of its supporting facts in the portion of the glaciated area lying\r\nwest of Pennsylvania. That there have been frequent oscillations of the\r\nglacial front over this area is certain. But it is a question whether\r\nthe glacial deposits south of this distinct line of moraine hills are so\r\ndifferent from those to the north of it as to necessitate the supposition\r\nof two entirely distinct glacial epochs. This can be considered most\r\nprofitably here.\r\n\r\nThe following are among the points with reference to which the phenomena\r\nsouth of the moraine just delineated differ from those north of the line:\r\n\r\n1. The glacial deposits to the south appear to be distributed more\r\nuniformly than those to the north. To the north the drift is often\r\naccumulated in hills, and is dotted over with kettle-holes, while to the\r\nsouth these are pretty generally absent. Any one travelling upon a line\r\nof railroad which traverses these two portions of the glaciated area as\r\nindicated upon our map can easily verify these statements.\r\n\r\n2. The amount of glacial erosion seems to be much less south of the line\r\nof moraine hills delineated than north of them. Still, glacial striæ\r\nare found, almost everywhere, close down to the extreme margin of the\r\nglaciated area.\r\n\r\n3. The gravel deposits connected with the drainage of the Glacial period\r\nare much less abundant south of the so-called \"terminal moraine of the\r\nsecond Glacial period\" than they are north of it. South of this moraine\r\nthe water deposits attributed to the Glacial period are of such fine\r\nsilt as to indicate slow-moving currents over a gentle low slope of the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n4. The glacial deposits to the south are more deeply coloured than those\r\nto the north, showing that they have been longer exposed to oxidising\r\nagencies. Even the granitic boulders show the marks of greater age south\r\nof this line, being disintegrated to a greater extent than those to the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n5. And, finally, there occur, over a wide belt bordering the so-called\r\nmoraine hills of the second Glacial epoch, extensive intercalated beds\r\nof vegetal deposits. Among the earliest of these to be discovered were\r\nthose of Montgomery County, Ohio, where, in 1870, Professor Orton, of the\r\nOhio Survey, found at Germantown a deposit of peat fourteen feet thick\r\nunderneath ninety-five feet of till, and there seem also to be glacial\r\ndeposits underneath the peat as well as over it. The upper portion of the\r\npeat contains \"much undecomposed sphagnous mosses, grasses, and sedges,\r\nand both the peat and the clayey till above it\" contain many fragments\r\nof coniferous wood which can be identified as red cedar (_Juniperus\r\nVirginianus_). In numerous other places in that portion of Ohio\r\nfresh-appearing logs, branches, and twigs of wood are found underneath\r\nthe till, or mingled with it, much as boulders are. Near Darrtown, in\r\nButler County, Ohio, red cedar logs were found under a covering of\r\nsixty-five feet of till, and so fresh that the perfume of the wood is\r\napparently as strong as ever. Similar facts occur in several other\r\ncounties in the glaciated area of southern Ohio and southern Indiana.\r\nProfessor Collett reports that all over southwestern Indiana peat, muck,\r\nrotted stumps, branches, and leaves of trees are found from sixty to one\r\nhundred and twenty feet below the surface, and that these accumulations\r\nsometimes occur to a thickness of from two to twenty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Section of till near Germantown, Ohio, overlying\r\nthick bed of peat. The man in the picture stands upon a shelf of peat\r\nfrom which the till has been eroded by the stream. The dark spot at\r\nthe right hand of the picture, just above the water, is an exposure of\r\nthe peat. The thickness of the till is ninety-five feet. The partial\r\nstratification spoken of in the text can be seen about the middle of the\r\npicture. The furrows up and down had been made by recent rains. (United\r\nStates Geological Survey.) (Wright.)]\r\n\r\nFarther to the northwest similar phenomena occur. Professor N. H.\r\nWinchell has described them most particularly in Fillmore and Mower\r\nCounties, Minnesota, from which they extend through a considerable\r\nportion of Iowa. In the above counties of Minnesota a stratum of peat\r\nfrom eighteen inches to six or eight feet in thickness, with much wood,\r\nis pretty uniformly encountered in digging wells, the depth varying from\r\ntwenty to fifty feet. This county is near the highest divide in the State\r\nof Minnesota, and from it \"flow the sources of the streams to the north,\r\nsouth, and east.\" The wood encountered in this stratum indicates the\r\nprevalence f coniferous trees, and the peat mosses indicate a cool and\r\nmoist climate.\r\n\r\nNor are intercalated vegetable deposits absent from the vast region\r\nfarther north over the area that drains into Hudson Bay. At Barnesville,\r\nin Clay County, Minnesota, which lies in the valley of the Red River of\r\nthe North, and also in Wilkin County in the same valley, tamarack wood\r\nand sandy black mud containing many snail-shells have been found from\r\neight to twelve feet below a surface of till; and Dr. Robert Bell reports\r\nthe occurrence of limited deposits of lignite between layers of till, far\r\nto the northwest, in Canada, and even upon the southern part of Hudson\r\nBay; while Mr. J. B. Tyrrell reports[BF] many indications of successive\r\nperiods of glaciation near the northern end of the Duck Mountain. The\r\nmost characteristic indications which he had witnessed consisted of\r\nstratified beds of silt, containing fresh-water shells, with fragments of\r\nplants and fish similar to those living in the lakes of the region at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BF: Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, vol. i, pp.\r\n395-410.]\r\n\r\nReviewing these facts with reference to their bearing upon the point\r\nunder consideration, we grant, at the outset, that they do indicate a\r\nsuccessive retreat and readvance of the ice over extensive areas. This\r\nis specially clear with respect to the vegetal deposits interstratified\r\nwith beds of glacial origin. But the question at issue concerning the\r\ninterpretation of these phenomena is, Do they necessarily indicate\r\nabsolutely distinct glacial epochs separated by a period in which the\r\nice had wholly disappeared from the glaciated area to the north? That\r\nthey do, is maintained by President Chamberlin and many others who have\r\nwide acquaintance with the facts. That they do not certainly indicate a\r\ncomplete disappearance of the ice during an extensive interglacial epoch,\r\nis capable, however, of being maintained, without forfeiting one's rights\r\nto the respect of his fellow-geologists. The opposite theory is thus\r\nstated by Dr. Robert Bell: \"It appears as if all the phenomena might be\r\nreferred to one general Glacial period, which was long continued, and\r\nconsequently accompanied by varying conditions of temperature, regional\r\noscillations of the surface, and changes in the distributions of sea and\r\nland, and in the currents in the ocean. These changes would necessarily\r\ngive rise to local variations in the climate, and might permit of\r\nvegetation for a time in regions which need not have been far removed\r\nfrom extensive glaciers.\"[BG]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BG: Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, vol. i, pp.\r\n287-310.]\r\n\r\nAt my request, Professor J. E. Todd, of Iowa, whose acquaintance with the\r\nregion is extensive, has kindly written out for me his conclusions upon\r\nthis subject, which I am permitted to give in his own words:\r\n\r\n\"I am not prepared to write as I would like concerning the forest-beds\r\nand old soils. I will, however, offer the following as a partial report.\r\nI have come to think that there is considerable confusion on the subject.\r\nI believe there are five or six different things classed under one head.\r\n\r\n\"1. _Recent Much and Soils._--The finest example I have found in the\r\nwhole Missouri Valley was twenty feet below silt and clay, in a basin\r\ninside the outer moraine, near Grand View, South Dakota. From my\r\nexamination of the reported old soil near Albia, Iowa, I think the most\r\nrational way of reconciling the conflicting statements concerning it is\r\nthat it also belongs to this class.\r\n\r\n\"2. _Peat or Soil under Loess._--This does not signify much if the loess\r\nwas formed in a lake subject to orographic oscillations, or if, as I am\r\ncoming to believe, it is a fluviatile deposit of an oscillating river\r\nlike the Hoang-Ho on the great Chinese plain. It at least does not mean\r\nan interglacial epoch.\r\n\r\n\"3. _Wood and Dirt rearranged, not in situ._--This occurs either in\r\nsubaqueous or in subglacial deposits. I have found drift-wood in the\r\nlower layers of the loess here, but not _in situ_. I have frequently\r\nfound traces of wood in till in Dakota, but always in an isolated\r\nway. I think, from reading statements about the deposits in eastern\r\nIowa, that most if not all of the cases are of this sort. Two things\r\nhave conspired to lead to this error: one, the influence of Croll's\r\nspeculation; and the other, the easy inference of many well-diggers,\r\nand especially well-borers, that what they pass through are always in\r\nlayers. In this way a log becomes a forest-bed. Scattered logs and muck\r\nfragments occurring frequently in a region, though at different levels,\r\nare readily imagined by an amateur geologist to be one continuous stratum\r\nantedating the glacier or floods (as the case may be in that particular\r\nregion), when, in fact, it has been washed down from the margin of\r\nthe transporting agent and is contemporaneous with it. I suspect the\r\nprevalence of wood in eastern Iowa may be traced to a depression of the\r\ndriftless region during the advance of the glacier, so as to bring the\r\nwestern side of that area more into the grasp of glacial agencies.\r\n\r\n\"4. _Peat between Subglacial Tills._--If cases of this sort are found,\r\nthey are in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Professor Worthen insisted that\r\nthere were no interglacial soils or forest-beds in Illinois; and in the\r\ncases mentioned in the State reports he repeatedly explains the sections\r\ngiven by his assistants, so as to harmonize them with that statement. I\r\nthink he usually makes his explanations plausible. He was very confident\r\nin referring most of them, to preglacial times. His views, I suppose,\r\nwill be published in the long-delayed volume, now about to be issued.\r\n\r\n\"5. _Vegetable Matter between Glacial Till and Underlying Berg Till or\r\nother Drift Deposits._--When one remembers that the front of the great\r\nice-sheet may have been as long in reaching its southern boundary as in\r\nreceding from it, and with as many advance and retrograde movements, we\r\ncan easily believe that much drift material would have outrun the ice and\r\nhave formed deposits so far ahead of it that vegetation would have grown\r\nbefore the ice arrived to bury it.\r\n\r\n\"6. _Preglacial Soils, etc._--I believe that this will be found to\r\ninclude most in southern Ohio, if not in Illinois, as Worthen claimed.\"\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of the Glacial period are too vast either to have appeared\r\nor to have disappeared suddenly. By whatever cause the great accumulation\r\nof ice was produced, the advance to the southward must have been slow\r\nand its disappearance must have been gradual, though, as we shall show\r\na little later, the final retreat of the ice-front occupied but a short\r\ntime relatively to the whole period which has elapsed since. As we\r\nshall show also, the advent of the Ice period was probably preceded and\r\naccompanied by a considerable elevation of the northern part of the\r\ncontinent Whether this elevation was contemporaneous upon both sides of\r\nthe continent is perhaps an open question; but with reference to the area\r\neast of the Rocky Mountains, which is now under consideration, the centre\r\nof elevation was somewhere south of Hudson Bay. Putting together what\r\nwe know, from the nature of the case, concerning the accumulation and\r\nmovement of glacial ice, and what we know from the relics of the great\r\nglacial invasion, which have enabled us to determine its extent and the\r\nvigour of its action, the course of events seems to have been about as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThroughout the Tertiary period a warm climate had prevailed over British\r\nAmerica, Greenland, and indeed over all the lands in proximity to the\r\nnorth pole, so far as explorers have been able to penetrate them. The\r\nvegetation characterizing these regions during the Tertiary period\r\nindicates a temperature about like that which now prevails in North\r\nCarolina and Virginia. Whatever may be said in support of the theory\r\nthat the Glacial period was produced by astronomical causes, in view of\r\npresent facts those causes cannot be regarded as predominant; at most\r\nthey were only co-operative. The predominant cause of the Glacial period\r\nwas probably a late Tertiary or post-Tertiary elevation of the northern\r\npart of the continents, accompanied with a subsidence in the central\r\nportion. Of such a subsidence in the Isthmus of Panama indications are\r\nthought to be afforded by the occurrence of late Tertiary or, more\r\nprobably, post-Tertiary sea-shells at a considerable elevation on the\r\ndivide along the Isthmus of Panama, between the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nOceans. Of this we shall speak more fully in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nFixing our thoughts upon what is known as the Laurentian plateau, which,\r\nthough now in the neighbourhood of but two thousand feet above the sea,\r\nwas then much higher, we can easily depict in imagination the beginnings\r\nof the great \"Laurentide Glacier,\" which eventually extended to the\r\nmargin already delineated on the south and southwest in the United\r\nStates, and spread northward and eastward over an undetermined area.\r\nYear after year and century after century the accumulating snows over\r\nthis elevated region consolidated into glacial ice and slowly pushed\r\noutward the surplus reservoirs of cold. For a long time this process of\r\nice-accumulation may have been accompanied by the continued elevation of\r\nthe land, which, together with the natural effect of the enlarging area\r\nof ice and snow, would tend to lower the temperature around the margin\r\nand to increase still more the central area of accumulation.\r\n\r\nThe vigour of movement in any direction was determined partly by the\r\nshape of the valleys opening southward in which the ice-streams would\r\nnaturally concentrate, and partly by those meteorological conditions\r\nwhich determine the extent of snow-fall over the local centres of glacial\r\ndispersion. For example, the general map of North America in the Ice\r\nperiod indicates that there were two marked subcentres of dispersion\r\nfor the great Laurentide Glacier, the eastern one being in Labrador and\r\nthe western one north of Lake Superior. In a general way the southern\r\nboundary of the glaciated region in the United States presents the\r\nappearance of portions of two circumferences of circles intersecting each\r\nother near the eastern end of Lake Erie. These circles, I am inclined\r\nto believe, represent the areas over which a semi-fluid (or a substance\r\nlike ice, which flows like a semi-fluid) would disperse itself from the\r\nsubcentres above mentioned.\r\n\r\nA study of the contour of the country shows that that also, in a general\r\nway, probably had something to do with the lines of dispersion. The\r\nwestern lobe of this glaciated area corresponds in its boundary pretty\r\nclosely with the Mississippi Valley, having the Ohio River approximately\r\nas its eastern arm and the Missouri as its western, with the Mississippi\r\nRiver nearly in its north and south axis. The eastern lobe has its\r\nfarthest extension in the axis of the Champlain and Hudson River Valleys,\r\nits western boundary being thrown more and more northward as the line\r\nproceeds to the west over the Alleghany Mountains until reaching the\r\nlongitude of the eastern end of Lake Erie; but this southern boundary is\r\nby no means a water-level, nor is the contour of the country such that\r\nit could ever have been a water-level. But it conforms in nearly every\r\nparticular to what would be the resultant arising from a pretty general\r\nsouthward flow of a semi-fluid from the two subcentres mentioned, meeting\r\nwith the obstructions of the Adirondacks in northern New York and of the\r\nbroader Appalachian uplift in northern Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHow far south the area of glacial accumulation may have extended cannot\r\nbe definitely ascertained, but doubtless at an early period of the great\r\nIce age the northern portions of the Appalachian range in New York, New\r\nEngland, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia became themselves centres of\r\ndispersion, while only at the height of the period did all their glaciers\r\nbecome confluent, so that there was one continuous ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nIn the western portion of the area covered by the Laurentide Glacier, the\r\ndepression occupied by the Great Lakes, especially Lakes Michigan and\r\nSuperior, evidently had a marked influence in directing the flow of ice\r\nduring the stages which were midway between the culmination of the Ice\r\nperiod and both its beginning and its end. This would follow from the\r\ngreat depth of these lakes, the bottom of Lake Michigan being 286 feet\r\nbelow sea-level, and that of Lake Superior 375 feet, making a total depth\r\nof water of about 900 and 1,000 feet respectively. Into these oblong\r\ndepressions the ice would naturally gravitate until they were filled,\r\nand they would become the natural channels of subsequent movement in the\r\ndirection of their longest diameters, while the great thickness of ice in\r\nthem would make them the conservative centres of glacial accumulation and\r\naction after the ice had begun to retreat.\r\n\r\nThese deductions from the known nature of ice and the known topography of\r\nthe region are amply sustained by a study of the detailed map showing the\r\nglacial geology in the United States. But on this we can represent indeed\r\nonly the marks left by the ice at various stages of its retreat, since,\r\nas already remarked, the marks of each stage of earlier advance would be\r\nobliterated by later forward movements. We may presume, however, that\r\nin general the marks left by the retreating ice correspond closely with\r\nthose actually made and obliterated by the advancing movement.\r\n\r\nFrom observations upon the glaciers of Switzerland and of Alaska, it\r\nis found that neither the advance nor the retreat of these glaciers is\r\nconstant, but that, in obedience to meteorologic agencies not fully\r\nunderstood, they advance and retreat in alternate periods, at one time\r\nreceding for a considerable distance, and at other times regaining the\r\nlost ground and advancing over the area which has been uncovered by their\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\"M. Forel reports, from the data which he has collected with much care,\r\nthat there have been in this century five periods in the Alpine glaciers:\r\nof enlargement, from 1800 (?) to 1815; of diminution, from 1815 to 1830;\r\nof enlargement, from 1830 to 1845; of diminution, from 1845 to 1875; and\r\nof enlargement again, from 1875 onward. He remarks further that these\r\nperiods correspond with those deduced by Mr. C. Lang for the variations\r\nfor the precipitations and temperature of the air; and, consequently,\r\nthat the enlargement of the glaciers has gone forward in the cold and\r\nrainy period, and the diminution in the warm and the dry.\"[BH]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BH: American Journal of Science, vol. cxxxii, 1886, p. 77.]\r\n\r\nWhen, now, we attentively consider the combination of causes necessary to\r\nproduce the climatic conditions of the great Ice age of North America, we\r\nshall be prepared to find far more extensive variations in the progress\r\nof the continental glacier, both during its advance and during its\r\nretreat, than are to be observed in any existing local glaciers.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the arguments adduced in favor of a succession of glacial\r\nepochs in America the following criticisms are pertinent:\r\n\r\n1. So far as we can estimate, a temporary retreat of the front, lasting\r\na few centuries, would be sufficient to account for the vegetable\r\naccumulations that are found buried beneath the glacial deposits in\r\nsouthern Ohio, Indiana, central Illinois, and Iowa, while a temporary\r\nreadvance of the ice would be sufficient to bury the vegetable remains\r\nbeneath a freshly accumulated mass of till. Thus, as Dr. Bell suggested,\r\nthe interglacial vegetal deposits do not necessarily indicate anything\r\nmore than a temporary oscillation of the ice-front, and do not carry\r\nwith them the necessity of supposing a disappearance of the ice from the\r\nwhole glaciated area. Thus the introduction of a whole Glacial period to\r\naccount for such limited phenomena is a violation of the well-known law\r\nof parsimony, which requires us in our explanations of phenomena to be\r\ncontent with the least cause which is sufficient to produce them. In the\r\npresent instance a series of comparatively slight oscillations of the\r\nice-front during a single glacial period would seem to be sufficient to\r\naccount for all the buried forests and masses of vegetal _débris_ that\r\noccur either in the United States or in the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\n2. Another argument for the existence of two absolutely distinct glacial\r\nperiods in North America has been drawn from the greater oxidation of\r\nthe clays and the more extensive disintegration of certain classes of\r\nthe boulders found over the southern part of the glaciated area of the\r\nMississippi Valley, than has taken place in the more northerly regions.\r\nWithout questioning this statement of fact (which, however, I believe to\r\nbe somewhat exaggerated), it is not difficult to see that the effects\r\nprobably are just what would result from a single long glacial period\r\nbrought about by such causes as we have seen to be probably in operation\r\nin America. For if one reflects upon the conditions existing when the\r\nGlacial period began, he will see that, during the long ages of warm\r\nclimate which characterised the preceding period, the rocks must have\r\nbeen extensively disintegrated through the action of subaërial agencies.\r\nThe extent to which this disintegration takes place can be appreciated\r\nnow only by those who reside outside of the glaciated area, where these\r\nagencies have been in uninterrupted action. In the Appalachian range\r\nsouth of the glaciated region the granitic masses and strata of gneiss\r\nare sometimes found to be completely disintegrated to a depth of fifty or\r\nsixty feet; and what seem to be beds of gravel often prove in fact to be\r\nhorizontal strata of gneiss from which the cementing material has been\r\nremoved by the slow action of acids brought down by the percolating water.\r\n\r\nNow, there can be no question that this process of disintegration had\r\nproceeded to a vast extent before the Glacial period, so that, when the\r\nice began to advance, there was an enormous amount of partially oxidised\r\nand disintegrated material ready to be scraped off with the first advance\r\nof ice, and this is the material which would naturally be transported\r\nfarthest to the south; and thus, on the theory of a single glacial\r\nperiod, we can readily account for the greater apparent age of the\r\nglacial _débris_ near the margin. This _débris_ was old when the Glacial\r\nperiod began.\r\n\r\n3. With reference to the argument for two distinct glacial periods drawn\r\nfrom the smaller apparent amount of glacial erosion over the southern\r\npart of the glaciated area, we have to remark that that would occur\r\nin case of a single ice-invasion as well as in case of two distinct\r\nice-invasions, in which the later did not extend so far as the former.\r\n\r\nFrom the very necessity of the case, glacial erosion diminishes as the\r\nlimit of the extent of the glaciation is approached. At the very margin\r\nof the glacier, motion has ceased altogether. Back one mile from the\r\nmargin only one mile of ice-motion has been active in erosion, while ten\r\nmiles back from its front there has been ten times as much moving ice\r\nactually engaged in erosion, and in the extreme north several hundred\r\ntimes as much ice, Thus it is evident that we do not need to resort to\r\ntwo glacial periods to account for the relatively small amount of erosion\r\nexhibited over the southern portion of our glaciated area.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it should be said that the indications of active\r\nglacial erosion near the margin are by no means few or small. In Lawrence\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania, on the very margin of the glaciated area, Mr. Max\r\nFoshay[BI] has discovered very extensive glacial grooves, indicating much\r\nvigour of ice-action even beyond the more extensive glacial deposits\r\nwhich Professor Lewis and myself had fixed upon as the terminal moraine.\r\nIn Highland and Butler Counties, Ohio, and in southwestern Indiana and\r\nsouthern Illinois, near the glacial margin, glacial grooves and striæ\r\nare as clear and distinct in many cases as can anywhere be found; while\r\nupon the surface of the limestone rocks within the limits of the city of\r\nSt. Louis, where the glacial covering is thin, and where disintegrating\r\nagencies had had special opportunities to work, I found very clear\r\nevidences of a powerful ice-movement, which had planed and scratched\r\nthe rock surface; and at Du Quoin, Illinois, as already related, the\r\nfragments thrown up from the surface of the rock, fifty or sixty feet\r\nbelow the top of the soil, were most beautifully planed and striated.\r\nIt should be observed, also, that this whole area is so deeply covered\r\nwith _débris_ that the extent of glacial erosion underneath is pretty\r\ngenerally hid from view.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BI: Bulletin of the Geological Society, vol. ii, pp. 457-464.]\r\n\r\n4. The uniformity of the distribution of the glacial deposits over the\r\nsouthern portion of the glaciated area in the Mississippi Valley is\r\npartly an illusion, due to the fact that there was a vast amount of\r\ndeposition by water over that area during the earlier stages of the\r\nice-retreat. This has been due partly to the gentler slope which would\r\nnaturally characterise the borders of an area of elevation, and partly to\r\nan extensive subsidence which seems to have begun soon after the ice had\r\nreached its farthest extent of motion.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that at all times a glacier is accompanied\r\nby the issue of vast streams of water from its front, and that these\r\nof course increase in volume when the climax has been reached and the\r\nameliorating influences begin to melt away the accumulated mass of ice\r\nand to add the volume of its water to that produced by ordinary agencies.\r\nAs these subglacial streams of water poured out upon the more gentle\r\nslopes of the area in front of the ice, they would distribute a vast\r\namount of fine material, which would settle into the hollow places and\r\ntend to obscure the irregularities of the previous direct glacial deposit.\r\n\r\nSuch an instance came clearly under my own observation in the vicinity of\r\nYankton, in South Dakota, where, upon visiting a locality some miles from\r\nany river, and to which workmen were resorting for sand, I found that the\r\ndeposit occupied a kettle-hole, filling it to its brim, and had evidently\r\nbeen superimposed by a temporary stream of water flowing over the region\r\nwhile the ice was still in partial occupation of it. Thus, no doubt, in\r\nmany cases, the original irregularities of the direct glacial deposits\r\nhave been obliterated, even where there has been no general subsidence.\r\n\r\nBut, in the area under consideration, the loess, or loam, is so extensive\r\nthat it is perhaps necessary to suppose that the central portions of the\r\nMississippi Valley were subjected to a subsidence amounting to about five\r\nhundred feet; so that the glacial streams from the retreating ice-front\r\nmet the waters of the ocean in southern Illinois and Indiana; thus\r\naccounting for the extensive fine silt which has done so much over that\r\nregion to obscure the glacial phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n_West of the Rocky Mountains._\r\n\r\nThe glacial phenomena in the United States west of the Rocky Mountains\r\nmust be treated separately, since American geologists have ceased to\r\nspeak of an all-pervading ice-cap extending from the north pole. But,\r\nas already said, the glaciation of North America has proceeded from\r\ntwo definite centres of ice-accumulation, one of which we have been\r\nconsidering in the pages immediately preceding. The great centre of\r\nglacial dispersion east of the Rocky Mountains is the region south of\r\nHudson Bay, and the vast ice-field spreading out from that centre is\r\nappropriately named the Laurentide Glacier. The movement of ice in this\r\nglacial system was outward in all directions from the Laurentian hills,\r\nand extended west several hundred miles, well on towards the eastern foot\r\nof the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe second great centre of glacial dispersion occupies the vast\r\nCordilleran region of British Columbia, reaching from the Rocky Mountains\r\non the northeast to the Coast Range of the Pacific on the southwest, a\r\nwidth of four hundred miles. The length is estimated by Dr. Dawson to\r\nbe twelve hundred miles. The principal centre of ice-accumulation lies\r\nbetween the fifty-fifth and the fifty-ninth parallel. From this centre\r\nthe movement was in all directions, but chiefly to the northwest and to\r\nthe south. The movement of the Cordilleran glaciers extended northwest\r\nto a distance of three hundred and fifty miles, leaving their moraines\r\nfar down in the Yukon Valley on the Lewes and Pelly Rivers.[BJ] Southward\r\nthe Cordilleran Glacier moved to a distance of six hundred miles,\r\nextending to the Columbia River, in the eastern part of the State of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BJ: See George M. Dawson, in Science, vol. xi, 1888, p. 186,\r\nand American Geologist, September, 1890, pp. 153-162.]\r\n\r\nFrom this centre, also, the ice descended to the sea-level upon the\r\nwest, and filled all the channels between Vancouver's Island and the\r\nmainland, as well as those in the Alexander Archipelago of Alaska. South\r\nof Vancouver's Island a glacier pushed out through the straits of Juan de\r\nFuca to an unknown distance. All the islands in Puget Sound are composed\r\nof glacial _débris_, resembling in every respect the terminal moraines\r\nwhich have been described as constituting many of the islands south of\r\nthe New England coast. The ice-movement in Puget Sound, however, was\r\nprobably northward, resulting from glaciers which are now represented by\r\ntheir diminutive descendants on the flanks of Mount Rainier.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Columbia River the country was never completely enveloped\r\nby the ice, but glaciers extended far down in the valleys from all the\r\nlofty mountain-peaks. In Idaho there are glacial signs from the summit\r\nof the Rocky Mountains down to the westward of Lake Pend d'Oreille. In\r\nthe Yellowstone Park there are clear indications that the whole area was\r\nenveloped in glacial ice. An immense boulder of granite, resting upon\r\nvolcanic deposits, may be found a little west of Inspiration Point, on\r\nthe Yellowstone Cañon. Abundant evidences of glacial action are also\r\nvisible down the Yellowstone River to the vicinity of Livingston, showing\r\nthat that valley must have been filled with glacial ice to a depth of\r\nsixteen hundred feet. To the west the glaciers from the Yellowstone\r\nPark extended to the border of Idaho, where a clearly marked terminal\r\nmoraine is to be found in the Tyghee Pass, leading over from the western\r\nfork of the Madison River into Lewis Fork of the Snake River. South of\r\nYellowstone Park the Teton Mountains were an important centre for the\r\ndispersion of local glaciers, but they did not descend upon the western\r\nside much below the 6,000-foot level, and only barely came to the edge\r\nof the great Snake River lava plains. To the east the movement from the\r\nTeton Mountains joined that from various other lofty mountains, where\r\naltogether they have left a most intricate system of glacial deposits, in\r\nwhose reticulations Jackson's Lake is held in place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Moraines of Grape Creek, Sangre del Cristo\r\nMountains, Colorado (after Stevenson).]\r\n\r\nIn Utah extensive glaciers filled all the northern valleys of the Uintah\r\nMountains, and extended westward in the Wahsatch range to the vicinity of\r\nSalt Lake City. The mountain region of Colorado, also, had its glaciers,\r\noccupying the head-waters of the Arkansas, the Platte, the Gunnison, and\r\nthe Grand Rivers. The most southern point in the Rocky Mountains at which\r\nsigns of local glaciers have been noted is near the summits of the San\r\nJuan range, in southwestern Colorado. Here a surface of about twenty-five\r\nsquare miles, extending from an elevation of 12,000 feet down to 8,000\r\nfeet, shows every sign of the former presence of moving ice. The greater\r\npart of the glaciation in Colorado is confined to elevations above 10,000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe whole range of the Sierra Nevada through Oregon, and as far south as\r\nthe Yosemite Valley in California, formerly sustained glaciers of far\r\ngreater size than any which are now found in those mountains. In general\r\nthese glaciers were much longer on the western side of the Sierra Nevada\r\nthan on the eastern. On the eastern side glaciers barely came down to\r\nLake Tahoe and Lake Mono in California. The State of Nevada seems to\r\nhave been entirely free from glaciers, although it contains numerous\r\nmountain-peaks more than ten thousand feet high. In the Yosemite Cañon\r\nglaciers extended down the Merced River to the mouth of the cañon; while\r\nin the Tuolumne River, a few miles to the north, the glaciers which still\r\nlinger about the peaks of Mount Dana filled the valley for a distance of\r\nforty miles.\r\n\r\nIt is a question among geologists whether or not the glaciation west\r\nof the Rocky Mountains was contemporaneous with that of the eastern\r\npart of the continent. The more prevalent opinion among those who have\r\nmade special study of the phenomena is that the development of the\r\nCordilleran glaciers was independent of that of the Laurentide system.\r\nAt any rate, the intense glaciation of the Pacific coast seems to have\r\nbeen considerably later than that of the Atlantic region. Of this we will\r\nspeak more particularly in discussing the questions of the date and the\r\ncause of the Glacial period. It is sufficient for us here simply to say\r\nthat, from his extensive field observations throughout the Cordilleran\r\nregion, Dr. George M. Dawson infers that there have been several\r\nsuccessive alternations of level on the Pacific coast corresponding to\r\nsuccessive glacial and interglacial epochs, and that when there was a\r\nperiod of elevation west of the Rocky Mountains there was a period of\r\nsubsidence to the east, and _vice versa_. In short, he supposes that the\r\neast and west for a long time played a game of seesaw, with the Rocky\r\nMountains as the fulcrum. We give his scheme in tabulated form.\r\n\r\n_Scheme of Correlation of the Phenomena of the Glacial Period in the\r\nCordilleran Region and in the Region of the Great Plains._\r\n\r\n\r\n  CORDILLERAN REGION.

The longest existing glacier in New Zealand\r\nis sixteen miles, but formerly one of them had a length of seventy-eight\r\nmiles. One of the ancient moraines contains a boulder from thirty to\r\nforty feet in diameter, and the amount of glacial _débris_ covering the\r\nmountain-sides is said to be enormous. Reports have also been recently\r\nbrought of signs of ancient glaciers in Australia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Generalised view of the whole glaciated region\r\nof North America. The area of motionless ground-ice is shown by the white\r\nlines in northern part of Alaska.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Darwin, there are distinct signs of glaciation upon the\r\nplains of Patagonia sixty or seventy miles east of the foot of the\r\nmountains, and in the Straits of Magellan he found great masses of\r\nunstratified glacial material containing boulders which were at least\r\none hundred and thirty miles away from their parent rock; while upon\r\nthe island of Chiloe he found embedded in \"hardened mud\" boulders which\r\nmust have come from the mountain-chains of the continent. Agassiz also\r\nobserved unquestionable glacial phenomena on various parts of the Fuegian\r\ncoast, and indeed everywhere on the continent south of latitude 37°.\r\nBetween Concepcion and Arauco, in latitude 37°, Agassiz observed, near\r\nthe sea-level, a glacial surface well marked with furrows and scratches,\r\nand as well preserved, he says, \"as any he had seen under the glaciers of\r\nthe present day.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Quartzite boulder of 45 cubic metres, on Mont\r\nLachat, 800 metres above the valley of the Belley, in Ain, France\r\n(Falsan).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nANCIENT GLACIERS IN THE EASTERN HEMISPHERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout two million square miles of northern Europe were covered with\r\nperennial ice during the Glacial period. From the scratches upon the\r\nrocks, and from the direction in which material has been transported,\r\nit is evident that the main centre of radiation is to be found in the\r\nmountains of Scandinavia, and that the glaciers still existing in Norway\r\nare the lineal descendants of those of the great Ice age.\r\n\r\nSo shallow are the Baltic Sea and the German Ocean, that their basins\r\nwere easily filled with ice, upon which Scandinavian boulders could be\r\ntransported westward to the east shore of England, southward into the\r\nplains of Germany, and eastward far out upon the steppes of Russia. The\r\nislands north of Scotland bear marks also of an ice-movement from the\r\ndirection of Norway. If Scotland itself was not overrun with Scandinavian\r\nglaciers, the reason was that it had ice enough of its own, and from\r\nits highlands set up a counter-movement, which successfully resisted\r\nthe invasion from the Scandinavian Peninsula. But, elsewhere in Europe,\r\nScandinavian ice moved freely outward to the extent of its capacity.\r\nThen, as now also, the Alps furnished centres for ice-movement, but the\r\nglaciers were limited to the upper portions of the valleys of the Rhône,\r\nthe Rhine, and the Danube upon the west and north, and to a still smaller\r\narea upon the southern side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.\r\n\r\nMAP showing\r\n\r\nGLACIATED AREAS\r\n\r\nin North America and Europe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Central and Southern Europe._\r\n\r\nThe main centres of ice-movement in the Alps during the Glacial period\r\nare the same as those which furnish the lingering glaciers of the present\r\ntime. From the water-shed between the Rhine, the Rhône, and the Aar,\r\nglaciers of immense size descended all the valleys now occupied by those\r\nstreams. The valley of the Rhône between the Bernese and the Pennine\r\nAlps was filled with a glacier of immense depth, which was maintained\r\nby fresh supplies from tributaries upon either side as far down as\r\nMartigny. Glacial markings at the head of the Rhône Valley are found upon\r\nthe Schneestock,[BK] at an elevation above the sea of about 11,500 feet\r\n(3,550 metres), or about 1,500 feet above the present surface of the\r\nRhône Glacier. At Fiesch, about twenty miles below, where tributaries\r\nfrom the Bernese Oberland snow-fields were received, the thickness of\r\nthe glacier was upwards of 5,000 feet (1,680 metres). Near Martigny,\r\nabout fifty miles farther down the valley, where the glacier was abruptly\r\ndeflected to the north, the depth of the ice was still upwards of 1,600\r\nmetres. From Martigny northward the thickness of the ice decreased\r\nrapidly for a few miles, where, at the enlargement of the valley above\r\nthe head of Lake Geneva, it was less than 1,200 metres in thickness, and\r\nspread out over the intervening plain as far as Chasseron, with a nearly\r\nlevel surface, transporting, as we have before said, Alpine boulders\r\nto the flanks of the Juras, and landing them about 3,000 feet (1,275\r\nmetres) above the level of Lake Geneva. The width of the main valley is\r\nhere about fifty miles, making the slope of the surface of the ice about\r\ntwenty feet to the mile.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BK: A. Falsan's La Période Grlaciaire étudiée principalement en\r\nFrance et en Suisse, chapitre xv.]\r\n\r\nFrom its \"vomitory,\" at the head of Lake Geneva, the ice of the ancient\r\nRhône Glacier spread to the right and to the left, while its northern\r\nboundary was abruptly terminated by the line of the Jura Mountains. The\r\nlaw of glacial motion was, however, admirably illustrated in the height\r\nto which the ice rose upon the flanks of the Jura. At Chasseron, in the\r\ndirect line of its onward motion, it rose to its highest point, while\r\nboth to the southwest and to the northeast, along the line of the Juras,\r\nthe ice-action was limited to constantly decreasing levels.\r\n\r\nDown the valley of the Rhône the direction of motion was determined by\r\nthe depression of Lake Geneva, at the lower end of which it received its\r\nmain tributary from Mont Blanc, which had come down from Chamouni through\r\nthe valley of the river Arve. From this point it was deflected by a spur\r\nof the Jura Mountains more and more southward to the vicinity of Culoz,\r\nnear the mouth of Lake Bourget. Here the glacier coming down from the\r\nwestern flanks of the Alps, through the upper valley of the Isère, past\r\nChambéry, became predominant, and deflected the motion to the west and\r\nnorth, whither the ice extended to a line passing through Bourg, Lyons,\r\nand Vienne, leaving upon one of the eminences on which Lyons is built a\r\nboulder several feet in diameter, which is duly preserved and labelled\r\nin the public park in that portion of the city. Farther south, glaciers\r\nof less extent marked the Alps most of the way to the Mediterranean, but\r\nthey were not at all comparable in size to those from the central region.\r\n\r\nTo the right of Lake Geneva the movement started by the Rhône Glacier\r\nspread eastward, being joined in the vicinity of Berne by the confluent\r\nice-stream which descended from the north flank of the Bernese Oberland,\r\nthrough the valley of the Aar. These united streams filled the whole\r\nvalley with ice as far down as Soleure.[BL]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BL: See map of Rhône Glacier, on p. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF\r\n\r\nGLACIAL MOVEMENTS\r\n\r\nIN FRANCE AND\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND.]\r\n\r\nFarther eastward, other ice-streams from the Alps became predominant,\r\none of which, moving down the Reuss, deployed out upon the country lying\r\nnorth of Lucerne and Zug. Still farther down, the ancient glacier which\r\ndescended the Limmatt spread itself out over the hills and lowlands about\r\nZürich, one of its moraines of retrocession nearly dividing the lake into\r\ntwo portions.\r\n\r\nGuyot and others have shown that the superficial deposits of this\r\nportion of Switzerland are just such as would be distributed by glaciers\r\ncoming down from the above-mentioned Alpine valleys. Uniting together\r\nnorth of Zürich, these glaciers pushed onward as far as the Rhine below\r\nSchaffhausen. In Frickthal the glacial ice was still 1,200 feet thick,\r\nand at Kaisterberg between 400 and 500 feet.\r\n\r\nAt Lucerne there is a remarkable exposure of pot-holes, and a glaciated\r\nsurface such as could be produced only by the combined action of moving\r\nice and running water; thus furnishing to tourists an instructive\r\nobject-lesson. Among the remarkable instances of boulders transported\r\na long distance in Switzerland, is that of a block of granite carried\r\nfrom the Valais to the vicinity of Soleure, a distance of one hundred\r\nand fifteen miles, which weighs about 4,100 tons. \"The celebrated\r\nPierre-à-Bot, above Neufchâtel, measures 50' × 20' × 40', and contains\r\nabout 40,000 cubic feet of stone; while the Pierre-des-Marmettes, near\r\nMonthey, contains no less than 60,840 cubic feet.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancient glacier of the Rhine, receiving its initial impulse in\r\nthe same centre as that of the Rhône, fully equalled it in all its\r\ndimensions. Descending eastward from its source near the Schneestock\r\nto Chur, a distance of fifty miles, it turned northward and continued\r\nforty-five miles farther to the head of Lake Constance, where it spread\r\nout in fan-shape, extending northwest to Thiengen, below Schaffhausen,\r\nand covering a considerable area north and northeastward of the lake,\r\nreaching in the latter direction Ulm, upon the Danube--the whole distance\r\nof the movement being more than one hundred and fifty miles. Through\r\nother valleys tributary to the Danube, glaciers descended upon the upper\r\nplains of Bavaria, from the Tyrolese Alps to the vicinity of Munich.\r\nFrom Gross Glockner as a centre in the Noric Alps, vast rivers of ice,\r\nof which the Pasterzen Glacier is the remnant, poured far down into the\r\nvalleys of the Inn and the Enns on the north and into that of the Drave\r\non the southeast. Farther eastward in this part of Europe the mountains\r\nseem to have been too low to have furnished centres for any general\r\ndispersion of glacial ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Map showing the Lines of _Débris_ extending\r\nfrom the Alps into the Plains of the Po (after Lyell). _A._ Crest of\r\nthe Alpine water-shed; _B._ Névé-fields of the ancient glaciers; _C._\r\nMoraines of ancient glaciers.]\r\n\r\nUpon the south side of the Alps the ancient glaciers spread far out\r\nupon the plains of Lombardy, where moraines of vast extent and of every\r\ndescription enable the student to determine the exact limits of the\r\nancient ice-action. From the southern flanks of Mont Blanc and Monte\r\nRosa, and from the snow-fields of the western Alps, glaciers of great\r\nvolume descended into the valley of Dora Baltea (vale of Aosta), and\r\non emerging from the mountain valley Spread Out over the plains around\r\nIvrea, leaving moraine hills in some instances 1,500 feet in height.\r\nThe total length of this glacier was as much as one hundred and twenty\r\nmiles. From the snow-fields in the vicinity of Mont Cenis, also, glaciers\r\nextended down the Dora Ripera to the vicinity of Turin, and down other\r\nvalleys to a less extent. The lateral moraines of the Diore, on the south\r\nside of Mont Blanc, at the head of the Dora Baltea, are 2,000 feet above\r\nthe present river, and extend upon the left bank for a distance of twenty\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nFrom the eastern Alps, glaciers descended through all the valleys of the\r\nItalian lakes and deposited vast terminal moraines, which still obstruct\r\nthe drainage, and produce the charming lakes of that region. A special\r\nhistoric interest pertains to the series of concentric moraines south of\r\nLake Garda, since it was in the reticulations of this glacial deposit\r\nthat the last great battle for Italian liberty was fought on June 24,\r\n1859. Defeated in the engagements farther up the valley of the Po, the\r\nAustrian general Benedek took his final stand to resist the united forces\r\nof France and Italy behind an outer semicircle of the moraine hills south\r\nof this lake (some of which are 500 or 600 feet above the surrounding\r\ncountry), with his centre at Solferino, about ten miles from Peschera.\r\nHere, behind this natural fortification, he awaited the enemy, who was\r\ncompelled to perform his manoeuvres on the open plain which spread out\r\non every side. But the natural fortifications furnished by the moraine\r\nhills were too extensive to be defended by an army of moderate size.\r\nThe troops of Napoleon and Victor Immanuel concentrated at Solferino\r\nand broke through the line. Thus the day was lost to the Austrians, and\r\nthey retired from Lombardy, leaving to Italy both the artificial and the\r\nnatural fortifications that guard the southern end of this important\r\nentrance to the Tyrolese Alps. When once his attention is called to the\r\nsubject, the traveller upon the railroad cannot fail to notice this\r\nseries of moraines, as he enters it through a tunnel at Lonato on the\r\nwest, and emerges from it at Soma Campagna, eighteen or twenty miles\r\ndistant to the east. A monument celebrating the victory stands upon a\r\nmoraine hill about half-way between, at Martino della Battaglie.\r\n\r\nIn other portions of central and southern Europe the mountains were too\r\nlow to furnish important centres for glacial movements. Still, to a\r\nlimited extent, the signs of ancient glaciers are seen in the mountains\r\nof the Black Forest, in the Harz and Erzgebirge, and in the Carpathians\r\non the east and among the Apennines on the south. In Spain, also, there\r\nwere limited ice-fields on the higher portions of the Sierra Nevada\r\nand in the mountains of Estremadura, and perhaps in some other places.\r\nIn France, small glaciers were to be found in the higher portions\r\nof the Auvergne, of the Morvan, of the Vosges, and of the Cevennes;\r\nwhile, from the Pyrenees, glaciers extended northward throughout nearly\r\ntheir whole extent. The ice-stream descending from the central mass of\r\nMaladetta through the upper valley of the Garonne, was joined by several\r\ntributaries, and attained a length of about forty-five miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The British Isles._\r\n\r\nDuring the climax of the Glacial period the Hebrides to the north of\r\nScotland were covered with ice to a depth of 1,600 feet. How far westward\r\nof this it moved out to the sea, it is of course impossible to tell. But\r\nin the channels between the Hebrides and Scotland it is evident that\r\nthe water was completely expelled by the ice, and that, from a height\r\nof 1,600 feet above the Hebrides to the northern shores of Scotland,\r\nthere was a continuous ice-field sloping southward at the rate of about\r\ntwenty-five feet a mile.\r\n\r\nScotland itself was completely enveloped in glacial ice. Prevented by\r\nthe Scandinavian Glacier from moving eastward, the Scotch movement was\r\ncompelled to be westward and southward. On the southwest the ice-stream\r\nreached the shores of Ireland, and became confluent with the glaciers\r\nthat enveloped that island, completely filling the Irish Sea.\r\n\r\nThere are so many controverted points respecting the glacial geology of\r\nEngland, and they have such an important bearing upon the main question\r\nof this volume, that a pretty full discussion of them will be necessary.\r\nI have recently been over enough of the ground myself to become satisfied\r\nof the general correctness of the views entertained by my late colleague,\r\nthe lamented Professor Henry Carvill Lewis, whose death in 1888 took\r\nplace before the publication of his most mature conclusions. But the\r\nlines of investigation to which he gave so powerful an impulse have since\r\nbeen followed out by an active body of scientific observers. To give the\r\nstatement of facts greater precision and authority, I have committed\r\nthe preparation of it to the Secretary of the Northwest of England\r\nBoulder Committee, Percy F. Kendall, F. G. S., Lecturer on Geology at\r\nthe Yorkshire College, Leeds, and at the Stockport Technical School,\r\nEngland.[BM]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BM: Mr. Kendall's contribution extends to page 181.]\r\n\r\n\"All the characteristic evidences of the action of land-ice can be found\r\nin the greatest perfection in many parts of England and Wales. Drumlins,\r\nkames, _roches moutonnées_, far-travelled erratics, terminal moraines,\r\nand perched blocks, all occur. There are, besides, in the wide-spread\r\ndeposits of boulder-clay which cover so many thousands of square miles on\r\nthe low grounds lying on either side of the Pennine chain, evidences of\r\nthe operation of ice-masses of a size far exceeding that of the grandest\r\nof existing European glaciers. But, while the proofs of protracted\r\nand severe glaciation are thus patent, there are, nevertheless, many\r\napparently anomalous circumstances which arrest the attention when the\r\nwhole country is surveyed. The glacial phenomena appear to be strictly\r\nlimited to the country lying to the northward of a line extending from\r\nthe Bristol Channel to the mouth of the Thames; and within the glaciated\r\narea there are many extensive tracts of land devoid of 'drift' or other\r\nindications of ice-action.\r\n\r\n\"By comparison with the phenomena displayed in the North American\r\ncontinent, English glacial geology must seem puny and insignificant; but,\r\njust as with the features of the 'Solid Geology,' we have compressed\r\nwithin the narrow limits of our isles an epitome of the features which\r\nacross the Atlantic require a continent for their exposition. It has\r\nresulted from this concentration that English geology requires a much\r\ncloser and more minute investigation. And the difficulty which has been\r\nexperienced by glacial geologists of dealing with an involved series of\r\nfacts has, in the absence of any clue leading to the co-ordination of a\r\nvast series of more or less disconnected observations, resulted in the\r\nadoption, to meet certain local anomalies, of explanations which were\r\nvery difficult if not impossible of reconciliation with facts observed\r\nin adjacent areas. Thus, to account for shell-bearing drift extending up\r\nto the water-shed on one side of a lofty range of hills, a submergence\r\nof the land to a depth of 1,400 feet has been postulated; leaving for\r\nindependent explanation the fact, that the opposite slopes of the hills\r\nand the low ground beyond were absolutely destitute of drift or of any\r\nevidence of marine action.\r\n\r\n\"In the following pages I must adopt a somewhat dogmatic tone, in order\r\nto confine myself within the limits of space which are imposed; and trust\r\nrather to the cohesion and consistency of the explanations offered and\r\nto a few pregnant facts than to the weighing and contrasting of rival\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\n\"The facts point conclusively to the action in the British Isles of\r\na series of glaciers radiating outward from the great hill chains or\r\nclusters, and, as the refrigeration progressed, becoming confluent and\r\nmoving though in the same general direction, yet with less regard to the\r\nminor inequalities of the ground. During these two stages many glaciers\r\nmust have debouched upon the sea-coast, with the consequent production of\r\nicebergs, which floated off with loads of boulders and dispersed them in\r\nthe random fashion which is a necessary characteristic of transport by\r\nfloating ice.\r\n\r\n\"With a further accentuation of the cold conditions the discharge of\r\nbergs from terminal fronts which advanced into the extremely shallow\r\nseas surrounding the British shores would be quite inadequate to relieve\r\nthe great press of ice, and a further coalescence of separate elements\r\nmust have resulted. In the case of enclosed seas--as, for example, the\r\nIrish Sea--the continued inthrust of glacier-ice would expel the water\r\ncompletely; and the conjoined ice-masses would take a direction of flow\r\nthe resultant of the momentum and direction of the constituent elements.\r\nIn other cases--as, for example, in the North Sea--extraneous ice\r\napproaching the shores might cause a deflection of the flow of the native\r\nglaciers, even though the foreign ice might never actually reach the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"To such a system of confluent glaciers, and to the separate elements\r\nout of which they grew, and into which, after the culmination, they were\r\nresolved, I attribute the whole of the phenomena of the English and Welsh\r\ndrift. And only at one or two points upon the coast, and raised but\r\nlittle above the sea-level, can I recognise any signs of marine action.\r\n\r\n\"_The Preglacial Level of the Land._--There is very little direct\r\nevidence bearing upon this point. In Norfolk the famous forest bed, with\r\nits associated deposits, stands at almost precisely the level which it\r\noccupied in preglacial times. At Sewerby, near Flamborough Head, there\r\nis an ancient beach and 'buried cliff' which the sea is now denuding of\r\nits swathing of drift-deposits, and its level can be seen to be almost\r\nabsolutely coincident with the present beach. Mr. Lamplugh, whose\r\ndescription of the 'Drifts of Flamborough Head,'[BN] constitutes one of\r\nthe gems of glacial literature, considers that there is clear evidence\r\nthat the land stood at this level for a long period. The beach is covered\r\nby a rain-wash of small extent, and that in turn by an ancient deposit\r\nof blown sand, while the lowest member of the drift series of Yorkshire\r\ncovers the whole. Mr. Lamplugh thinks that the blown sand may indicate\r\na slight elevation of the land; but the beach appears to me to be the\r\nstorm beach, and the reduction in the force of the waves such as would\r\nresult from the approach of an ice-front a few miles to the seaward would\r\nprobably produce the necessary conditions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BN: Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, vol. xlvii.]\r\n\r\n\"Six miles to the northward of Flamborough, at Speeton, a bed of\r\nestuarine silt containing the remains of mollusca in the position of life\r\noccurs at an altitude of ninety feet above high-water mark. Mr. Lamplugh\r\ninclines to the opinion that this bed is of earlier date than the 'buried\r\ncliff'; he also admits the possibility that its superior altitude may be\r\ndue to a purely local upward bulging of the soft Lower Cretaceous clays\r\nupon which the estuarine bed rests by the weight of the adjacent lofty\r\nchalk escarpment.\r\n\r\n\"The evidence obtained from inland sections and borings in different\r\nparts of England has been taken to indicate a greater altitude in\r\npreglacial times. Thus, in Essex, deep-borings have revealed the\r\nexistence of deep drift-filled valleys, having their floors below\r\nsea-level. The valley of the Mersey is a still better example. Numerous\r\nborings have been made in the neighbourhood of Widnes and at other places\r\nin the lower reaches of the river, making it clear that there is a\r\nchannel filled with drift and extending to 146 feet below mean sea-level.\r\nThis, with several other instances, has been taken to indicate a greater\r\naltitude for the land in preglacial times, since a river could not\r\nerode its channel to such a depth below sea-level. The argument appears\r\ninconclusive for one principal reason: no mention is made of any river\r\ngravels or other alluvium in the borings. Indeed, there is an explicit\r\nstatement that the deposits are all glacial, showing that the channel\r\nmust have been cleared out by ice. This, therefore, leaves open the\r\nvital question, whether the deposits removed were marine or fluviatile.\r\nIt may be remarked that the great estuary of the Mersey has undoubtedly\r\nbeen produced by a post-glacial (and probably post-Roman) movement of\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\n\"_The Preglacial Climate._--In all speculations regarding the cause\r\nof the Glacial epoch, due account must be taken of the undoubted fact\r\nthat it came on with extreme slowness and departed with comparative\r\nsuddenness. In the east of England an almost perfect and uninterrupted\r\nsequence of deposits is preserved, extending from the early part of the\r\nPliocene period down to the present day.\r\n\r\n\"These in descending order are:\r\n\r\n\"1. Post-glacial sands, gravels, etc.\r\n\r\n\"2. Glacial series.\r\n\r\n\"3. The 'Forest Bed' and associated marine deposits.\r\n\r\n\"4. Chillesford clay and sand.\r\n\r\n\"5. The many successive stages of the Red Crag. (The Norwich Crag is a\r\nlocal variation of the upper part of the Red Crag.)\r\n\r\n\"6. The Coralline Crag.\r\n\r\n\"The fossils preserved in these deposits, apart from the physical\r\nindications, exhibit the climatal changes which accompanied their\r\ndeposition. The Coralline Crag contains a fauna consisting mainly\r\nof species which now range to the Mediterranean, many of them being\r\nrestricted to the warm southern waters. Associated with these are a few\r\nboreal forms, but they are represented in general by few individuals.\r\nHere and there in the deposits of this age far-travelled stones are to\r\nbe found, but they are always accounted great rarities.\r\n\r\n\"The Red Crag consists of an irregular assemblage of beaches and\r\nsand-banks of widely different ages, but their sequence can be made out\r\nwith ease by a study of the fauna. In the oldest deposits, Mediterranean\r\nspecies are very numerous, while the boreal forms are comparatively rare;\r\nbut in successive later deposits the proportions are very gradually\r\nreversed, and from the overlying Chillesford series the Mediterranean\r\nspecies are practically absent. The physical indications run _pari\r\npassu_ with the paleontological, and in the newer beds of the Red Crag\r\nfar-travelled stones are common.\r\n\r\n\"In the Forest Bed series there is a marine band--the _Leda myalis_\r\nbed--which contains an almost arctic assemblage of shells; while at about\r\nthe same horizon plant remains have been found, including such high\r\nnorthern species as _Salix polaris_ and _Betula nana_.\r\n\r\n\"The glacial deposits do not, in my opinion, contain anywhere in England\r\nor Wales a genuine intrinsic fauna, such shells as occur in the East\r\nAnglian glacial deposits having been derived in part from a contemporary\r\nsea-bed, and, for the rest, from the older formations, down perhaps to\r\nthe Coralline Crag. In the post-glacial deposits we have hardly any trace\r\nof a survival of the boreal forms, and I consider that the whole marine\r\nfauna of the North Sea was entirely obliterated at the culmination of the\r\nGlacial epoch, and that the repeopling in post-glacial times proceeded\r\nmainly from the English Channel, into which the northern forms never\r\npenetrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_The Great Glacial Centres._\r\n\r\n\"Where such complex interactions have to be described as were produced\r\nby the conflicting glaciers of the British Isles it is difficult to\r\ndeal consecutively with the phenomena of any one area, but with short\r\ndigressions in explanation of special points it may be possible to\r\naccomplish a clear presentation of the facts.\r\n\r\n\"_Wales._--The phenomena of South Wales are comparatively simple. Great\r\nglaciers travelled due southward from the lofty Brecknock Beacons,\r\nand left the characteristic _moutonnée_ appearance upon the rocky bed\r\nover which they moved. The boulder-transport is in entire agreement\r\nwith the other indications, and there are no shells in the drift. The\r\nfacts awaiting explanation are the occurrence in the boulder-clays of\r\nGlamorganshire, at altitudes up to four hundred feet, of flints, and of\r\nigneous rocks somewhat resembling those of the Archæan series of the\r\nWrekin. At Clun, in Shropshire, a train of erratics (see map) has been\r\ntraced back to its source to the westward. On the west coast, in Cardigan\r\nBay, the boulders are all such as might have been derived from the\r\ninterior of Wales. At St. David's Peninsula, Pembrokeshire, striæ occur\r\ncoming in from the northwest, and, taken with the discovery of boulders\r\nof northern rocks, may point to a southward extension of a great glacier\r\nproduced by confluent sheets that choked the Irish Sea. Information\r\nis very scanty regarding large areas in mid-Wales, but such as can be\r\ngathered seems to point to ice-shedding having taken place from a north\r\nand south parting line. In North Wales, much admirable work has been done\r\nwhich clearly indicates the neighbourhood of Great Arenig (Arenig Mawr)\r\nas the radiant point for a great dispersal of blocks of volcanic rock of\r\na characteristic Welsh type.\r\n\r\n\"_Ireland._--A brief reference must be made to Ireland, as the ice which\r\ntook origin there played an important part in bringing about some strange\r\neffects in English glaciation, which would be inexplicable without a\r\nrecognition of the causes in operation across the Irish Sea. Ireland\r\nis a great basin, surrounded by an almost continuous girdle of hills.\r\nThe rainfall is excessive, and the snow-fall was probably more than\r\nproportionately great; therefore we might expect that an ice-sheet of\r\nvery large dimensions would result from this combination of favouring\r\nconditions. The Irish ice-sheet appears to have moved outward from about\r\nthe centre of the island, but the main flow was probably concentrated\r\nthrough the gaps in the encircling mountains.\r\n\r\n\"_Galloway._--The great range of granite mountains in the southwestern\r\ncorner of Scotland seems to have given origin to an immense mass of ice\r\nwhich moved in the main to the southward, and there are good grounds\r\nfor the belief that the whole ice-drainage of the area, even that which\r\ngathered on the northern side of the water-shed, ultimately found its\r\nway into the Irish Sea basin and came down coastwise and across the low\r\ngrounds of the Rinns of Galloway, being pushed down by the press of\r\nHighland ice which entered the Firth of Clyde. It is a noteworthy fact\r\nthat marine shells occur in the drift in the course taken by the ice\r\ncoming on to the extremity of Galloway from the Clyde.\r\n\r\n\"_The Lake District._--A radial flow of ice took place down the valleys\r\nfrom about the centre of the Cumbrian hill-plexus, but movement to the\r\neastward was at first forbidden by the great rampart of the Cross Fell\r\nescarpment, which stretches like a wall along the eastern side of the\r\nVale of Eden.\r\n\r\n\"During the time when the Cumbrian glaciers had unobstructed access\r\nto the Solway Frith, to the Irish Sea, and to Morecambe Bay, the\r\ndispersal of boulders of characteristic local rocks would follow the\r\nordinary drainage-lines; but, as will be shown later, a state of affairs\r\nsupervened in the Irish Sea which resulted, in many cases, in a complete\r\nreversal of the ice-flow.\r\n\r\n\"_The Pennine Chain_ was the source of glaciers of majestic dimensions\r\nupon both its flanks in the region north of Skipton, but to the southward\r\nof that breach in the chain (see map) no evidence is obtainable of any\r\nlocal glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_The Confluent Glaciers._\r\n\r\n\"With the growth of ice-caps upon the great centres a condition of\r\naffairs was brought about in the Irish Sea productive of results which\r\nwill readily be foreseen. The enormous volumes of ice poured into\r\nthe shallow sea from north, south, east, and west, resulted in such\r\na congestion as to necessitate the initiation of some new systems of\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\n\"_The Irish Sea Glacier._--The ice from Galloway, Cumbria, and Ireland\r\nbecame confluent, forming what the late Professor Carvill Lewis termed\r\n'the Irish Sea Glacier,' and took a direction to the southward. Here it\r\ncame in diametrical conflict with the northward-flowing element of the\r\nWelsh sheet, which it arrested and mastered; and the Irish Sea Glacier\r\nbifurcated, probably close upon the precipitous Welsh coast to the\r\neastward of the Little Orme's Head, and the two branches flowed coastwise\r\nto eastward and westward, keeping near the shore-line.\r\n\r\n\"The westerly branch swept round close to the coast in a southwesterly\r\ndirection, and completely overrode Anglesea; striating the rock-surfaces\r\nfrom northeast to southwest (see map), and strewing the country with\r\nits bottom-moraine, containing characteristic northern rocks, such\r\nas the Galloway granites, the lavas and granites of the central and\r\nwestern portions of the Lake District, and fragments of shells derived\r\nfrom shell-banks in the Irish Sea. One episode of this phase of the\r\nice-movement was the invasion of the first line of hills between the\r\nMenai Straits and Snowdon. The gravels and sands of Fridd-bryn-mawr,\r\nMoel Tryfaen, and Moel-y-Cilgwyn, are the coarser washings of the\r\nbottom-moraine, and consequently contain such rock-fragments and shells\r\nas characterise it. From Moel-y-Cilgwyn southward, evidence is lacking\r\nregarding the course taken by the glacier, but it probably passed over or\r\nbetween the Rivals Mountains (Yr Eifl), and down Cardigan Bay at some\r\ndistance from the coast in confluence with the ice from mid-Wales; and,\r\nas I have suggested, may have passed over St. David's Head.\r\n\r\n\"Returning now towards the head of the glacier we may follow with\r\nadvantage its left bank downward. The ice-flow on the Cumberland coast\r\nappears to have resembled very much that in North Wales. A great press of\r\nice from the northward (Galloway) seems to have had a powerful 'easting'\r\nimparted to it by the conjoint influences of the thrust of the Irish ice\r\nand the inflow of ice from the Clyde. Whatever may have been the cause,\r\nthe effect is clear: about Ravenglass cleavage took place, and a flow to\r\nnorthward and to southward, each bending easterly. By far the larger mass\r\ntook a southerly course and bent round Black Combe, over Walney, and a\r\nstrip of the mainland about Barrow in Furness, and out into and across\r\nMorecambe Bay. Its limits are marked in the field by the occurrence of\r\nthe same rocks which characterise it in Anglesea, viz., the granites of\r\nGalloway and of west and central Cumbria.\r\n\r\n\"The continued thrust shouldered in the glacier upon the mainland of\r\nLancashire, but the precise point of emergence has not yet been traced,\r\nthough it cannot be more than a few miles from the position indicated on\r\nthe map. I should here remark, that all along the boundaries the Irish\r\nSea Glacier was confluent with local ice, except, probably, in that part\r\nof the Pennine chain to the southward of Skipton. Down to Skipton there\r\nwas a great mass of Pennine ice which was compelled to take an almost\r\ndue southerly course, and thus to run directly athwart the direction of\r\nthe main hills and valleys. A sharp easterly inflection of the Irish Sea\r\nGlacier carried it up the valley of the Ribble, and thence, under the\r\nshoulder of Pendle, to Burnley, where Scottish granites are found in the\r\nboulder-clay.\r\n\r\n\"On the summit of the Pennine water-shed, at Heald Moor, near Todmorden\r\n(1,419 feet), boulder-clay has been found containing erratics belonging\r\nto this dispersion; while in the gorge of the Yorkshire Calder, which\r\nflows along the eastern side of the same hill, not a vestige of such a\r\ndeposit is to be found, saving a few erratic pebbles at a distance of\r\neight or ten miles, which were probably carried down by flood-wash from\r\nthe edge of the ice.\r\n\r\n\"From this point the limits of the ice may be traced along the flanks of\r\nthe Pennine chain at an average altitude of about 1,100 feet.\r\n\r\n\"At one place the erratics can be traced to a position which would\r\nindicate the formation of an extra-morainic lake having its head at a\r\ncol about 1,000 feet above sea-level, separating it from the valley of\r\nan eastward-flowing stream, the Wye, about twelve miles down which a few\r\ngranite blocks have been found. Other extra-morainic lakes must have\r\nbeen formed, but very little information has been collected regarding\r\nthem. The Irish Sea Glacier can be shown to have spread across the whole\r\ncountry to the westward of the line I have traced, and beyond the estuary\r\nof the Dee.\r\n\r\n\"I may now follow its boundaries on the Welsh coast, and pursue the line\r\nto the final melting-place of the glacier. From the Little Orme's Head\r\nthe line of confluence with the native ice is pretty clearly defined. It\r\nruns in, perhaps, half a mile from the shore, until the broad low tract\r\nof the Vale of Clwyd is reached. Here the northern ice obtained a more\r\ncomplete mastery, and pushed in even as far as Denbigh. This extreme\r\nlimit was probably attained as a mere temporary episode. Horizontal striæ\r\non a vertical face of limestone on the crags dominating the mouth of the\r\nvale on the eastern side attest beyond dispute the action of a mass of\r\nland-ice moving in from the north.\r\n\r\n\"I may here remark, that in this district the deposits furnish a very\r\ncomplete record of the events of the Glacial period. In the cliffs on\r\nthe eastern side of the Little Orme's Head, and at several other points\r\nalong the coast towards the east, a sequence may be observed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"4. Boulder-clay with northern erratics and shells.\r\n\r\n\"3. Sands and gravels with northern erratics and shells.\r\n\r\n\"2. Boulder-clay with northern erratics and shells.\r\n\r\n\"1. Boulder-clay with Welsh erratics and no shells.\r\n\r\n\"A similar succession is to be seen in the Vale of Clwyd. The\r\ninterpretation is clear: In the early stages of glaciation the Welsh\r\nice spread without hindrance to, and laid down, bed No. 1; then the\r\nnorthern ice came down, bringing its typical erratics and the scourings\r\nof the sea-bottom, and laid down the variable series of clays, sands, and\r\ngravels which constitute Nos. 2, 3, and 4 of the section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--The Cefn Cave, in Vale of Clwyd. (Trimmer.) _a_,\r\nEntrance; _b_, mud with pebbles and wood covered with stalagmite; _c_,\r\nmud, bones, and angular fragments of limestone; _d_, sand and silt, with\r\nfragments of marine shells; _e_, fissure; _f_, northern drift; _g_, cave\r\ncleared of mud; _h_, river Elwy, 100 feet below; _i_, limestone rock.]\r\n\r\n\"In the Vale of Clwyd an additional interest is imparted to the study of\r\nthe drift from the circumstance that the remains of man have been found\r\nin deposits in caves sealed with drift-beds. The best example is the Cae\r\nGwyn caves, in which flint implements and the bones and teeth of various\r\nextinct animals were found embedded in 'cave-earth' which was overlaid\r\nby bedded deposits of shell-bearing drift, with erratics of the northern\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n\"It has been supposed that the drift-deposits were marine accumulations;\r\nbut it is inconceivable that the cave could ever have been subjected to\r\nwave-action without the complete scouring out of its contents.\r\n\r\n\"To resume the delineation of the limits of the great Irish Sea Glacier:\r\nFrom the Vale of Clwyd the boundary runs along the range of hills\r\nparallel to the estuary of the Dee at an altitude of about nine hundred\r\nfeet. As it is traced to the southeast it gradually rises, until at\r\nFrondeg, a few miles to the northward of the embouchure of the Yale of\r\nLlangollen, it is at a height of 1,450 feet above sea-level. Thence it\r\nfalls to 1,150 feet at Gloppa, three miles to the westward of Oswestry,\r\nand this is the most southerly point to which it has been definitely\r\ntraced on the Welsh border, though scattered boulders of northern rocks\r\nare known to occur at Church Stretton.\r\n\r\n\"Along the line from the Vale of Clwyd to Oswestry the boundary is\r\nmarked by a very striking series of moraine-mounds. They occur on the\r\nextreme summits of lofty hills in a country generally almost driftless,\r\nand their appearance is so unusual that one--Moel-y-crio--at least\r\nhas been mistaken for an artificial tumulus. The limitation of the\r\ndispersal of northern erratics by these mounds is very clear and\r\nsharp; and Mackintosh, in describing those at Frondeg, remarked that,\r\nwhile no northern rocks extended to the westward of them, so no Welsh\r\nerratics could be found to cross the line to the eastward. There are\r\nWelsh erratics in the low grounds of Cheshire and Shropshire, but their\r\ndistribution is sporadic, and will be explained in a subsequent section.\r\n\r\n\"Having thus followed around the edges of this glacier, it remains to\r\ndescribe its termination. It is clear that the ice must have forced its\r\nway over the low water-shed between the respective basins of the Dee and\r\nthe Severn. So soon as this ridge (less than 500 feet above the sea)\r\nis crossed, we find the deposits laid down by the glacier change their\r\ncharacter, and sands and gravels attain a great predominance.[BO] Near\r\nBridgenorth, and, at other places, hills composed of such materials\r\nattain an altitude of 200 feet. From Shrewsbury _via_ Burton, and thence,\r\nin a semicircular sweep, through Bridgenorth and Enville, there is an\r\nimmense concentration of boulders and pebbles, such as to justify the\r\ndesignation of a terminal moraine. To the southward, down the valley\r\nof the Severn, existing information points to the occurrence merely of\r\nsuch scattered pebbles as might have been carried down by floods. In the\r\ndistrict lying outside this moraine there is a most interesting series of\r\nglacial deposits and of boulders of an entirely different character. (See\r\nmap.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote BO: Mackintosh, Q. J. G. S.]\r\n\r\n\"From the neighbourhood of Lichfield, through some of the suburbs of\r\nBirmingham, and over Frankley Hill and the Lickey Hills to Bromsgrove,\r\nthere is a great accumulation of Welsh erratics, from the neighbourhood,\r\nprobably, of Arenig Mawr.\r\n\r\n\"The late Professor Carvill Lewis suggested that these Arenig rocks\r\nmight have been derived from some adjacent outcrop of Palæozoic rocks--a\r\nsuggestion having its justification in the discoveries that had been made\r\nof Cumbrian rocks in the Midlands. To test the matter, an excavation was\r\nmade at a point selected on Frankley Hill, and a genuine boulder-clay\r\nwas found, containing erratics of the same type as those found upon the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\"The explanation has since been offered that this boulder-clay was a\r\nmarine deposit laid down during a period of submerge nee.[BP] Apart\r\nfrom the difficulty that the boulder-clay displays none of the ordinary\r\ncharacteristics of a marine deposition, but possesses a structure,\r\nor rather absence of structure, in many respects quite inconsistent\r\nwith such an origin, and contains no shells or other remains of marine\r\ncreatures, it must be pointed out that no theory of marine notation\r\nwill explain the distribution of the erratics, and especially their\r\nconcentration in such numbers at a station sixty or seventy miles from\r\ntheir source.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BP: Proceedings of the Birmingham Philosophical Society, vol.\r\nvi, Part I, p. 181.]\r\n\r\n\"Upon the land-ice hypothesis this difficulty disappears. During the\r\nearly stages of the Glacial period the Welsh ice had the whole of\r\nthe Severn Valley at its mercy, and a great glacier was thrust down\r\nfrom Arenig, or some other point in central Wales, having an _initial\r\ndirection_, broadly speaking, from west to east. This glacier extended\r\nacross the valley of the Severn, sweeping past the Wrekin, whence it\r\ncarried blocks of the very characteristic rocks to be lodged as boulders\r\nnear Lichfield; and it probably formed its terminal moraine along the\r\nline indicated. (See lozenge-shaped marks on the map.) As the ice in\r\nthe north gathered volume it produced the great Irish Sea Glacier,\r\nwhich pressed inland and down the Vale of Severn in the manner I have\r\ndescribed, and brushed the relatively small Welsh stream out of its path,\r\nand laid down its own terminal moraine in the space between the Welsh\r\nborder and the Lickey Hills. It seems probable that the Welsh stream\r\ncame mainly down the Vale of Llangollen, and thence to the Lickey Hills.\r\nBoulders of Welsh rocks occur in the intervening tract by ones and twos,\r\nwith occasional large clusters, the preservation of any more connected\r\ntrail being rendered impossible by the great discharge of water from\r\nthe front of the Irish Sea Glacier, and the distributing action of the\r\nglacier itself.\r\n\r\n\"Within the area in England and Wales covered by the Irish Sea Glacier\r\nall the phenomena point to the action of land-ice, with the inevitable\r\nconcomitants of subglacial streams, extra-morainic lakes, etc. There is\r\nnothing to suggest marine conditions in any form except the occurrence\r\nof shells or shell fragments; and these present so many features of\r\nassociation, condition, and position inconsistent with, what we should\r\nbe led to expect from a study of recent marine life, that conchologists\r\nare unanimous in declaring that not one single group of them is on the\r\nsite whereon the shells lived. It is a most significant fact--one out of\r\na hundred which could be cited did space permit--that in the ten thousand\r\nsquare miles of, as it is supposed, recently elevated sea-bottom, not a\r\nsingle example of a bivalve shell with its valves in apposition has ever\r\nbeen found! Nor has a boulder or other stone been found encrusted with\r\nthose ubiquitous marine parasites, the barnacles.\r\n\r\n\"The evidences of the action of land-ice within the area are everywhere\r\napparent in the constancy of direction of-- (1.) Striæ upon rock\r\nsurfaces. (2.) The terminal curvature of rocks. (3.) The 'pull-over' of\r\nsoft rocks. (4.) The transportal of local boulders. (5.) The orientation\r\nof the long axes of large boulders. (6.) The false bedding of sands\r\nand gravels. (7.) The elongation of drift-hills. (8.) The relations\r\nof 'crag and tail.' There is a similar general constancy, too, in the\r\ndirections of the striæ upon large boulders. Upon the under side they run\r\nlongitudinally from southeast (or thereabouts) to northwest, while upon\r\nthe upper surface they originate at the opposite end, showing that the\r\nscratches on the under side were produced by the stone being dragged from\r\nnorthwest to southeast, while those on the top were the product of the\r\npassage of stone-laden ice over it in the same direction.\r\n\r\n\"Such an agreement cannot be fortuitous, but must be attributed to the\r\noperation of some agent acting in close parallelism over the whole\r\narea. To attribute such regularity to the action of marine currents is\r\nto ignore the most elementary principles of marine hydrology. Icebergs\r\nmust, in the nature of things, be the most erratic of all agents, for\r\nthe direction of drift is determined--among other varying factors--by\r\nthe draught of the berg. A mass of small draught will be carried by\r\nsurface currents, while one of greater depth will be brought within the\r\ninfluence of under-currents; and hence it not infrequently happens that\r\nwhile floe-ice is drifting, say, to the southeast, giant bergs will go\r\ncrashing through it to the northwest. There are tidal influences also to\r\nbe reckoned with, and it is matter of common knowledge that flotsam and\r\njetsam travel back and forth, as they are alternately affected by ebb and\r\nflood tide.\r\n\r\n\"Bearing these facts in mind, it is surely too much to expect that\r\nmarine ice should transport boulders (how it picked up many of them also\r\nrequires explanation) with such unfailing regularity that it can be said\r\nwithout challenge,[BQ] 'boulders in this district [South Lancashire and\r\nCheshire] never occur to the north or west of the parent rock.' The\r\nsame rule applies without a single authentic exception to the whole\r\narea covered by the eastern branch of the Irish Sea Glacier; and hence\r\nit comes about that not a single boulder of Welsh rock has ever been\r\nrecorded from Lancashire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BQ: Brit. Assoc. Report, 1890, p. 343.]\r\n\r\n\"_The Solway Glacier._--The pressure which forced much of the Irish Sea\r\nice against the Cumbrian coast-line caused, as has been described, a\r\ncleavage of the flow near Ravenglass, and, having followed the southerly\r\nbranch to its termination in the midlands, the remaining moiety demands\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\"The 'easting' motion carried it up the Solway Frith, its right flank\r\nspreading over the low plain of northern Cumberland, which it strewed\r\nwith boulders of the well-known 'syenite' (granophyre) of Buttermere.\r\nWhen this ice reached the foot of the Cross Fell escarpment, it suffered\r\na second bifurcation, one branch pushing to the eastward up the valley\r\nof the Irthing and over into Tyneside, and the other turning nearly due\r\nsouthward and forcing its way up the broad Vale of Eden.\r\n\r\n\"Under the pressure of an enormous head of ice, this stream rose from\r\nsea-level, turned back or incorporated the native Cumbrian Glacier\r\nwhich stood in its path, and, having arrived almost at the water-shed\r\nbetween the northern and the southern drainage, it swept round to the\r\neastward and crossed over the Pennine water-shed; not, however, by the\r\nlowest pass, which is only some 1,400 feet above sea-level, but by the\r\nhigher pass of Stainmoor, at altitudes ranging from 1,800 to 2,000\r\nfeet. The lower part of the course of this ice-flow is sufficiently\r\nwell characterised by boulders of the granite of the neighbourhood of\r\nDalbeattie in Galloway; but on its way up the Vale of Eden it gathered\r\nseveral very remarkable rocks and posted them as way-stones to mark its\r\ncourse. One of these rocks, the Permian Brockram, occurs nowhere _in\r\nsitu_ at altitudes exceeding 700 feet, yet in the course of its short\r\ntransit it was lifted about a thousand feet above its source. The Shap\r\ngranite (see radiant point on map) is on the northern side of the east\r\nand west water-sheds of the Lake District, and reaches its extreme\r\nelevation, (1,656 feet) on Wasdale Pike; yet boulders of it were carried\r\nover Stainmoor, at an altitude of 1,800 feet literally by tens of\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n\"This Stainmoor Glacier passed directly over the Pennine chain, past the\r\nmouths of several valleys, and into Teesdale, which it descended and\r\nspread out in the low grounds beyond. Pursuing its easterly course, it\r\nabutted upon the lofty Cleveland Hills and separated into two streams,\r\none of which went straight out to sea at Hartlepool, while the other\r\nturned to the southward and flowed down the Vale of York, being augmented\r\non its way by tributary glaciers coming down Wensleydale. The final\r\nmelting seems to have taken place somewhere a little to the southward\r\nof York; but boulders of Shap granite by which its extension is\r\ncharacterised have been found as far to the southward as Royston, near\r\nBarnsley.\r\n\r\n\"The other branch of the Solway Glacier--that which travelled due\r\neastward--passed up the valley of the Irthing, and over into that of the\r\nTyne, and out to sea at Tynemouth. It carried the Scottish granites with\r\nit, and tributary masses joined on either hand, bringing characteristic\r\nboulders with them.\r\n\r\n\"The fate of those elements of the Solway Frith Glacier which reached\r\nthe sea is not left entirely to conjecture. The striated surfaces near\r\nthe coast of Northumberland indicate a coastwise flow of ice from the\r\nnorthward--probably from the Frith of Forth--and the glaciers coming out\r\nfrom the Tyne and Tees were deflected to the southward.\r\n\r\n\"There is conclusive evidence that this ice rasped the cliffs of the\r\nYorkshire coast and pressed up into some of the valleys. Where it passed\r\nthe mouth of the Tees near Whitby it must have had a height of at least\r\n800 feet, but farther down the coast it diminished in thickness. It\r\nnowhere extended inland more than a mile or two, and for the most part\r\nkept strictly to the coast-line. Along the whole coast are scattered\r\nerratics derived from Galloway and the places lying in the paths of the\r\nglaciers. In many places the cliffs exhibit signs of rough usage, the\r\nrocks being crumpled and distorted by the violent impact of the ice. At\r\nFiley Brigg a well-scratched surface has been discovered, the striation\r\nbeing from a few degrees east of north.\r\n\r\n\"At Speeton the evidence of ice-sheet or glacier-work is of the most\r\nstriking character. On the top of the cliffs of Cretaceous strata a line\r\nof moraine-hills has been laid down, extending in wonderful perfection\r\nfor a distance of six miles. They consist of a mixture of sand,\r\ngravel, and a species of clay-rubble, with occasional masses of true\r\nboulder-clay, the whole showing the arched bedding so characteristic\r\nof such accumulations. At the northerly end the moraine keeps close to\r\nthe edge of the chalk cliffs, which are there 400 feet high, and the\r\nhills are frequently displayed in section; but as the elevation of the\r\ncliffs declines they fall back from the edge of the cliffs and run quite\r\nacross the headland of Flamborough, and are again exposed in section in\r\nBridlington Bay. One remarkable and significant fact is pointed out,\r\nnamely, that behind this moraine, within half a mile and at a lower\r\nlevel, the country is almost absolutely devoid of any drift whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Moraine between Speeton and Flamborough\r\n(Lamplugh).]\r\n\r\n\"The interpretation of these phenomena is as follows: When the\r\nvalley-glaciers reached the sea they suffered the deflection which has\r\nbeen mentioned, partly as the result of the interference of ice from\r\nthe east of Scotland, but also influenced directly by the cause which\r\noperated upon the Scottish ice and gave direction to it--that is, the\r\nimpact of a great glacier from Scandinavia, which almost filled the North\r\nSea, and turned in the eastward-flowing ice upon the British coast.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to see how this pressure must have forced the glacier-ice\r\nagainst the Yorkshire coast, but vertical chalk cliffs 400 feet in\r\nheight are not readily surmounted by ice of any thickness, however\r\ngreat, and so it coasted along and discharged its lateral moraine upon\r\nthe cliff-tops. As the cliffs diminished in height we find the moraine\r\nfarther inland, and, as I have pointed out, the ice completely overrode\r\nFlamborough Head. Amongst the boulders at Flamborough are many of Shap\r\ngranite, a few Galloway granites, a profusion of Carboniferous rocks,\r\nbrought by the Tyne branch of the Sol way Glacier as well as by that of\r\nStainmoor, and, besides many torn from the cliffs of Yorkshire, a few\r\nexamples of unquestionable Scandinavian rocks, such as the well-known\r\n_Rhomben-porphyr_. It is important to note that about ten to twenty\r\nmiles from the Yorkshire coast there is a tract of sea-bottom called\r\nby trawlers 'the rough ground,' in allusion to the fact that it is\r\nstrewn with large boulders, amongst which are many of Shap granite. This\r\nprobably represents a moraine of the Teesdale Glacier, laid down at a\r\ntime when the Scandinavian Glacier was not at its greatest development.\r\n\r\n\"On the south side of Flamborough Head the 'buried cliff' previously\r\nalluded to occurs. The configuration of the country shows--and the\r\nconclusion is established by numerous deep-borings--that the preglacial\r\ncoast-line takes a great sweep inland from here, and that the plain of\r\nHolderness is the result of the banking-up of an immense thickness of\r\nglacial _débris_. In the whole country reviewed, from Tynemouth to\r\nBridlington, wherever the ice came on to the land from the seaward, it\r\nbrought in shells and fragmentary patches of the sea-bottom involved in\r\nits ground moraine. Space does not permit of a detailed description of\r\nthe several members of the Yorkshire Drift, and I pass on to deal in a\r\ngeneral way with the glacial phenomena of the eastern side of England.\r\n\r\n\"_The East Anglian Glacier._--The influence of the Scandinavian ice is\r\nclearly seen in the fact that the entire ice-movement down the east\r\ncoast south of Bridlington was all from the _seaward_. Clays, sands, and\r\ngravels, the products of a continuous mass of land-ice coming from the\r\nnortheast are spread over the whole country, from the Trent to the high\r\ngrounds on the north of London overlooking the Thames.\r\n\r\n\"The line of extreme extension of these drift-deposits runs from Finchley\r\n(near London), in the south across Hertfordshire, through Cambridgeshire,\r\nwith outlying patches at Gogmagog and near Buckingham, and northwestward\r\nover a large portion of Leicestershire into the upper waters of the\r\nTrent, embracing the elevated region of Palæozoic rocks at Charnwood\r\nForest, near Leicester.\r\n\r\n\"Reserving the consideration of the very involved questions connected\r\nwith the drifts of the upper part of the Trent Valley, I may pass\r\non to join the phenomena of the southeastern counties with those at\r\nFlamborough Head. From Nottinghamshire the limits of the drift of the\r\nEast Anglian Glacier seem to run in a direction nearly due west to east,\r\nfor the great oolitic escarpment upon which Lincoln Cathedral is built\r\nis absolutely driftless to the northward of the breach about Sleaford.\r\nHowever, along the western flank of the oolitic range true boulder-clay\r\noccurs, bordering and doubtless underlying the great fen-tract of\r\nmid-Lincolnshire; and the great Lincolnshire Wolds appear to have been\r\ncompletely whelmed beneath the ice.\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable of the deposits in this area is the Great Chalky\r\nBoulder-Clay, which consists of clay containing much ground-up chalk,\r\nand literally packed with well-striated boulders of chalk of all sizes,\r\nfrom minute pebbles up to blocks a foot or more in diameter. Associated\r\nwith them are boulders of various foreign rocks, and many flints in a\r\nremarkably fresh condition, and still retaining the characteristic white\r\ncoat, except where partially removed by glacial attrition.\r\n\r\n\"One of the perplexing features of the glacial phenomena in the eastern\r\ncounties of England is the extension of true chalky boulder-clay to the\r\nnorth London heights at Finchley and elsewhere; for only the faintest\r\ntraces are to be found in the gravel deposits of the Thames Valley of any\r\nwash from such a deposit, or from a glacier carrying such materials.\r\n\r\n\"It has been suggested that the deposit may have been laid down in an\r\nextra-morainic lake, or in an extension of the North. Sea, but these\r\nsuggestions leave the difficulty just where it was. If a lake or sea\r\ncould exist without shores, a glacier-stream might equally dispense with\r\nbanks. Within the area of glaciation, defined above, abundant evidence\r\nof the action of land-ice is obtainable, though striated surfaces are\r\nextremely rare--a fact attributable to the softness of the chalk and\r\nclays which occupy almost the whole area. Well-striated surfaces are\r\nfound on the harder rocks, as, for example, on the oolitic limestone at\r\nDunston, near Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Skertchly has remarked that the proofs of the action of land-ice\r\nare irrefragable. The Great Chalky Boulder-Clay covers an area of\r\n3,000 square miles, and attains an altitude of 500 feet above the\r\nsea-level, thus bespeaking, if the product of icebergs, 'an extensive\r\ngathering-ground of chalk, having an elevation of more than 500 feet.\r\nBut where is it? Certainly not in Western Europe, for the chalk does not\r\nattain so great an elevation except in a few isolated spots.'[BR]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BR: Geikie's Great Ice Age, p. 360.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Diagram-section near Cromer (Woodward). 6.\r\nGravel and sand (Middle Glacial) resting on contorted drift (loam, sand,\r\nand marl, with large included boulders of chalk); 5.

Weybourn crag; 1. Chalk with\r\nflints; * Large included boulder of chalk.]\r\n\r\n\"It has been further pointed out by Mr. Skertchly, that the condition of\r\nthe flints in this deposit furnishes strong evidence that they could not\r\nhave been carried by floating ice nor upon a glacier, for, in either of\r\nthe latter events, there must have been some exposure to the weather,\r\nwhich, as he remarks, would have rendered them worthless to the makers of\r\ngun-flints, whereas they are now regularly collected for their use.\r\n\r\n\"The way in which the boulder-clay is related to the rocks upon which\r\nit rests is a conclusive condemnation of any theory of floating ice;\r\nfor example, where it rests upon Oxford Clay, it contains the fossils\r\ncharacteristic of that formation, as it is largely made up of the clay\r\nitself. The exceptions to this rule are as suggestive as those cases\r\nwhich conform to it. Each outcrop yields material to the boulder-clay to\r\nthe south westward, showing a pull-over from the northeast.\r\n\r\n\"One of the most remarkable features of the drift of this part of\r\nEngland is the inclusion of gigantic masses of rock transported for\r\na short distance from their native outcrop, very often with so small\r\na disturbance that they have been mapped as _in situ_. Examples of\r\nchalk-masses 800 feet in length, and of considerable breadth and\r\nthickness, have been observed in the cliffs near Cromer, in Norfolk, but\r\nthey are by no means restricted to situations near the coast. One example\r\nis mentioned in which quarrying operations had been carried on for some\r\nyears before any suspicion was aroused that it was merely an erratic.\r\nThe huge boulders were probably dislodged from the parent rock by the\r\nthrust of a great glacier, which first crumbled the beds, then sheared\r\noff a prominent fold and carried it along. This explanation we owe to Mr.\r\nClement Reid.[BS] The drift-deposits of this region frequently contain\r\nshells, but they rarely constitute what may be termed a consistent fauna,\r\nusually showing such an association as could only be found where some\r\nagent had been at work gathering together shells of different habitats\r\nand geological age.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BS: See Geology of the Country around Cromer, and Geology of\r\nHolderness, Memoirs of Geological Survey of England and Wales.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Section at right angles to the cliff through\r\nthe westerly chalk bluff at Trimingham, Norfolk, showing the manner in\r\nwhich chalk masses are incorporated into the till (Clement Reid).

A more extensive disturbance, like that at Trimingham drives\r\nbefore it a long ridge of the bads, and nips up the chalk, till, like\r\na cloth creased by the sliding of a heavy book, it is folded into an\r\ninverted anticlinal. A slight increase of pressure, and the third stage\r\nis reached--the top of the anticlinal being entirely sheared off, the\r\nchalk boulder driven up an incline, and forced into the overlying\r\nboulder-clays.\" (Clement Reid.)]\r\n\r\n\"Attempts have been made to correlate the deposits over the whole area,\r\nbut with very indifferent success. A consideration of the consequences\r\nof the invasion of the country by an ice-stream from the northeast will\r\nprepare us for any conceivable complication of the deposits.\r\n\r\n\"The main movement was against the drainage of the country, so that\r\nthe ice-front must have been frequently in water. There would be\r\naqueous deposition and erosion; the kneading up of morainic matter into\r\nground-moraine; irregularities of distribution and deposition due to ice\r\nfloating in an extra-morainic lake; flood-washes at different points of\r\noverflow; and other confusing causes, which make it rather matter for\r\nsurprise that any order whatever is traceable.\r\n\r\n\"I now turn to the valley of the Trent. We find that it occupies such a\r\nposition that it would be exposed, successively or simultaneously, to\r\nthe action of ice-streams of most diverse origin. I have shown that the\r\narea to the westward of Lichfield was invaded at one period by a Welsh\r\nglacier, and at a subsequent one by the Irish Sea Glacier, and both of\r\nthese streams entered the valley of the Trent or some of its affluents.\r\nFrom the eastward, again, the great North Sea Glacier encroached in like\r\nmanner, carrying the Great Chalky Boulder-Clay even into the drainage\r\narea of the westward-flowing rivers near Coventry.\r\n\r\n\"The glacial geology of the Trent Valley from Burton to Nottingham has\r\nbeen ably dealt with by Mr. R. M. Deeley,[BT] who recognises a succession\r\nwhich may be generalised as follows: (1.) A lower series containing rocks\r\nderived from the Pennine chain; (2.) A middle series containing rocks\r\nfrom the eastward (chalky boulder-clay, etc.); and (3.) An upper series\r\nwith Pennine rocks. Mr. Deeley thinks the Pennine _débris_ may have\r\nbeen brought by glaciers flowing down the valleys of the Dove, the Wye,\r\nand the Derwent; but, while recognising the importance of the testimony\r\nadduced, especially that of the boulders, I am compelled to reserve\r\njudgment upon this point until something like moraines or other evidences\r\nof local glaciers can be shown in those valleys. In their upper parts\r\nthere is not a sign of glaciation. Some of the deposits described must\r\nhave been laid down by land-ice; while the conformation of the country\r\nshows that during some stages of glaciation a lake must have existed\r\ninto which the different elements of the converging glaciers must have\r\nprojected. This condition will account for the remarkable commingling of\r\nboulders observed in some of the deposits. Welsh, Cumbrian, and Scottish\r\nrocks occur in the western portion of the Trent Valley. The overflow of\r\nthe extra-morainic lake would find its way into the valleys of the Avon\r\nand Severn, and may be taken to account for the abundance of flints in\r\nsome of the gravels.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BT: Quarterly Journal Geological Society, vol. xlii, p. 437.]\r\n\r\n\"_The Isle of Man._--This little island in mid-seas constituted in the\r\nearly stages of the Glacial epoch an independent centre of glaciation,\r\nand from some of its valleys ice-streams undoubtedly descended to the\r\nsea; but with the growth of the great Irish Sea Glacier the native ice\r\nwas merged in the invading mass, and at the climax of the period the\r\nwhole island was completely buried, even to its highest peak (Snae Fell,\r\n2,054 feet), beneath the ice. The effects of this general glaciation\r\nare clearly seen in the mantle of unstratified drift material which\r\noverspread the hills; in the _moutonnée_ appearance of the entire\r\nisland; and in the transport of boulders of local rocks. The striations\r\nupon rock surfaces show a constancy of direction in agreement with the\r\nboulder-transport which can be ascribed to no other agency than a great\r\ncontinuous sheet of such dimensions as to ignore minor hills and valleys.\r\n\r\n\"The disposition of the striæ is equally conclusive, for we find that on\r\na stepped escarpment of limestone both the horizontal and the vertical\r\nfaces are striated continuously and obliquely from the one on to the\r\nother, showing that the ice had a power of accommodating itself to the\r\nsurface over which it passed that could not be displayed by floating ice.\r\nThere is a remarkable fact concerning the distribution of boulders on\r\nthis island which would strike the most superficial observers, namely,\r\nthat foreign rocks are confined to the low grounds. It might be argued\r\nthat the local ice always retained its individuality, and so kept the\r\nforeign ice with its characteristic boulders at bay. But, apart from\r\nthe _a priori_ improbability of so small a hill-cluster achieving what\r\nthe Lake District could not accomplish, the fact that Snae Fell, an\r\nisolated _conical_ hill, is swathed in drift from top to bottom, is\r\nquite conclusive that the foreign ice must have got in. Why, then, did\r\nit carry no stones with it? The following suggestion I make not without\r\nmisgivings, though there are many facts to which I might appeal that seem\r\nstrongly corroborative:\r\n\r\n\"The hilly axis of the island runs in a general northeast and southwest\r\ndirection, and it rises from a great expanse of drift in the north with\r\nsingular abruptness, some of the hills being almost inaccessible to a\r\ndirect approach without actual climbing. I imagine that the ice which\r\nbore down upon the northern end of the island was, so far as its lower\r\nstrata were concerned, unable to ascend so steep an acclivity, and was\r\ncleft, and flowed to right and left. The upper ice, being of ice-sheet\r\norigin, would be relatively clean, and this flowing straight over the\r\ntop of the obstruction would glaciate the country with such material as\r\nwas lying loose upon the ground or could be dislodged by mere pressure.\r\nIt would appear from published descriptions that the Isle of Arran\r\noffers the same problem, and I would suggest the application of the same\r\nsolution to it.\r\n\r\n\"Marine shells occur in the Manx drift, but only in such situations\r\nas were reached by the ice-laden with foreign stones. They present\r\nsimilar features of association of shells of different habitat, and\r\nperhaps of geological age, to those already referred to as being common\r\ncharacteristics of the shell-faunas of the drift of the mainland. Four\r\nextinct species of mollusca have been recognised by me in the Manx drift.\r\n\r\n\"The Manx drift is of great interest as showing, perhaps better than any\r\nlocality yet studied, those features of the distribution of boulders of\r\nnative rocks which attest so clearly the exclusive action of land-ice.\r\nThere are in the island many highly characteristic igneous rocks, and I\r\nhave found that boulders of these rocks never occur to the northward of\r\nthe parent mass, and very rarely in any direction except to the southwest.\r\n\r\n\"Cumming observed in regard to one rock, the Foxdale granite, that\r\nwhereas the highest point at which it occurs _in situ_ was 657 feet\r\nabove sea-level, boulders of it occurred in profusion within 200 feet of\r\nthe summit of South Barrule (1,585 feet), a hill two miles only, in a\r\nsouthwesterly direction, from the granite outcrop.\r\n\r\n\"They also occur on the summit of Cronk-na-Irrey-Lhaa, 1,449 feet above\r\nsea-level. The vertical uplift has been 728 and 792 feet respectively.\r\n\r\n\"In the low grounds of the north of the island a finely developed\r\nterminal moraine extends in a great sweep so as to obstruct the drainage\r\nand convert thousands of acres of land into lake and morass, which is\r\nonly now yielding to artificial drainage. Many fine examples of drumlin\r\nand esker mounds occur at low levels in different parts of the island;\r\nand it was remarked nearly fifty years ago by Cumming, that their long\r\naxes were parallel to the direction of ice-movement indicated by the\r\nstriated surfaces and the transport of boulders.\r\n\r\n\"The foreign boulders are mainly from the granite mountains of Galloway,\r\nbut there are many flints, presumably from Antrim, a very small number\r\nof Lake District rocks, and a remarkable rock containing the excessively\r\nrare variety of hornblende, Riebeckite. This has now been identified with\r\na rock on Ailsa Crag, a tiny islet in the Frith of Clyde; and a Manx\r\ngeologist, the Rev. S. N. Harrison, has discovered a single boulder of\r\nthe highly characteristic pitchstone of Corriegills, in the Isle of Arran.\r\n\r\n\"_The So-called Great Submergence._\r\n\r\n\"It may be convenient to adduce some additional facts which render the\r\ntheory of a great submergence of the country south of the Cheviots\r\nuntenable.\r\n\r\n\"The sole evidence upon which it rests is the occurrence of shells,\r\nmostly in an extremely fragmentary condition, in deposits occurring at\r\nvarious levels up to about 1,400 feet above sea-level: A little space may\r\nprofitably be devoted to a criticism of this evidence.\r\n\r\n\"_Moel Tryfaen_ ('The Hill of the Three Rocks').--This celebrated\r\nlocality is on the first rise of the ground between the Menai Straits and\r\nthe congeries of hills constituting 'Snowdonia'; and when we look to the\r\nnorthward from the top of the hill (1,350 feet) we see the ground rising\r\nfrom the straits in a series of gentle undulations whose smooth contours\r\nwould be found from a walk across the country to be due to the thick\r\nmask of glacial deposits which obliterates the harsher features of the\r\nsolid rocks.\r\n\r\n\"The deposits on Moel Tryfaen are exposed in a slate-quarry on the\r\nnorthern aspect of the hill near the summit, and consist of two wedges\r\nof structureless boulder-clay, each thinning towards the top of the\r\nhill. The lower mass of clay, wherever it rests upon the rock, contains\r\nstreaks and irregular patches of eccentric form, of sharp, perfectly\r\nangular fragments of slate; and the underlying rock may be seen to be\r\ncrushed and broken, its cleavage-laminæ being thrust over from northwest\r\nto southeast--that is, _up-hill_. The famous 'shell-bed' is a thick\r\nseries of sands and gravels interosculated with the clays on the slope of\r\nthe hill, but occupying the entire section above the slate towards the\r\ntop. The bedding shows unmistakable signs of the action of water, both\r\nregular stratification and false bedding being well displayed. The stones\r\noccurring in the clays are mainly if not entirely Welsh, including some\r\nfrom the interior of the country, and they are not infrequently of large\r\nsize--two or three tons' weight--and well scratched.\r\n\r\n\"The stones found in the sands and gravels include a great majority of\r\nlocal rocks, but besides these there have been recorded the following:\r\n\r\n     Rock.

The opportunities\r\nfor collecting are as good as could be desired. The sections exposed have\r\nan aggregate length of about a quarter of a mile, with a height varying\r\nfrom ten to twenty feet of the shelly portion; and besides this there are\r\nimmense spoil-banks, upon whose rain-washed slopes fossil-collecting can\r\nbe carried on under the most favorable conditions.\r\n\r\n\"I would here remark, that the occurrence of small seams of shelly\r\nmaterial of exceptional richness has impressed collectors with the idea\r\nthat they were dealing with a veritable shell-bed, when the facts would\r\nbear a very different interpretation. A fictitious abundance is brought\r\nabout by a process of what may be termed 'concentration,' by the action\r\nof a gently flowing current of water upon materials of different sizes\r\nand different specific gravities. Shells when but recently vacated\r\nconsist of materials of rather high specific gravity, penetrated by pores\r\ncontaining animal matter, so that the density of the whole mass is far\r\nbelow that of rocks in general, and hence a current too feeble to move\r\npebbles would yet carry shells. Illustrations of this process may be\r\nobserved upon any shore in the concentration of fragments of coal, corks,\r\nor other light material.\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the interpretation of these facts: The commonly received\r\nidea is, that the beds were laid down in the sea during a period of\r\nsubmergence, and that the shells lived, not perhaps on the spot, but\r\nsomewhere near, and that the terminal curvature of the slate was produced\r\nby the grounding of icebergs which also brought the boulders. But if\r\nthis hypothesis were accepted, it would be necessary to invest the\r\nflotation of ice with a constancy of direction entirely at variance with\r\nobserved facts, for the phenomena of terminal curvature is shown\" with\r\nperfect persistence of direction wherever the boulder-clay rests upon the\r\nrock; and, further, there is the highly significant fact, that neither\r\nthe sands and gravels nor the rock upon which they rest show any signs of\r\ndisturbance or contortion, such as must have been produced if floating\r\nice had been an operative agent.\r\n\r\n\"The uplift of foreign rocks is equally significant; and when we take\r\ninto account the great distances from which they have been borne and\r\nthe frequency with which such an operation must have been repeated, the\r\ninadequacy becomes apparent of Darwin's ingenious suggestion, that it\r\nmight have been effected by a succession of uplifts by shore-ice during\r\na period of slow subsidence; while the character and abundance of the\r\nmolluscan remains invest with a species of irony the application of the\r\nterm 'shell-bed' to the deposit.\r\n\r\n\"I now turn to the alternative explanation (see _ante_, p. 145), viz.,\r\nthat the whole of the phenomena were produced by a mass of land-ice which\r\nwas forced in upon Moel Tryfaen from the north or northwest, overpowering\r\nany Welsh ice which obstructed its course. This view is in harmony with\r\nthe observations regarding the 'terminal curvature' of the slates, the\r\noccurrence of sharp angular chips of slate in the boulder-clay, and the\r\ncoincidence of direction of these indications of movement with the carry\r\nof foreign stones. The few shells and shell-crumbs in the sands and\r\ngravels would, upon this hypothesis, be the infinitesimal relics of huge\r\nshell-banks in the Irish Sea which were destroyed by the glacier and in\r\npart incorporated in its ground-moraine or involved in the ice itself.\r\nThe sands and gravels would represent the wash which would take place\r\nwherever, by the occurrence of a 'nunatak' or by approach to the edge of\r\nthe ice, water could have a free escape.\r\n\r\n\"Two principal objections have been urged to the land-ice explanation\r\nof the Moel Tryfaen deposits. An able critic asks, 'Can, then, ice walk\r\nup-hill?' To this we answer, Given a sufficient 'head' behind it, and\r\nice can certainly achieve that feat, as every _roche moutonnée_ proves.\r\nIf it be granted that ice on the small scale can move up-hill, there is\r\nno logical halting-place between the uplift of ten or twenty feet to\r\nsurmount a _roche moutonnée_, and an equally gradual elevation to the\r\nheight of Moel Tryfaen. Furthermore, the inland ice of Greenland is known\r\nto extrude its ground-moraine on the 'weather-side' of the nunataks, and\r\nthe same action would account for the material uplifted on Moel Tryfaen.\r\n\r\n\"The second objection brought forward was couched in somewhat these\r\nterms: 'If the Lake District had its ice-sheet, surely Wales had one\r\nalso. Could not Snowdonia protect the heart of its own domain?' Of\r\ncourse, Wales had its ice-sheet, and the question so pointedly raised\r\nby the objector needs an answer; and though it is merely a question\r\nof how much force is requisite to overcome a certain resistance (both\r\nfactors being unknown), still there are features in the case which render\r\nit specially interesting and at the same time comparatively easy of\r\nexplanation. It seems rather like stating a paradox, yet the fact is,\r\nthat it was the proximity of Snowdon which, in my opinion, enabled the\r\nforeign ice to invade Wales at that point.\r\n\r\n\"A glance at the map will show that the 'radiant point' of the Welsh ice\r\nwas situated on or near Arenig Mawr, and that the great mass of Snowdon\r\nstands quite on the periphery of the mountainous regions of North Wales,\r\nso that it would oppose its bulk to fend off the native ice-sheet and\r\nprevent it from extending seaward in that direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Section across Wales to show the relationship of\r\nnative to foreign ice.]\r\n\r\n\"As a consequence, the only Welsh ice in position to obstruct the onward\r\nmarch of the invader would be such trifling valley-glaciers as could form\r\non the western slopes of Snowdon itself.\r\n\r\n\"The peak of Snowdon is 3,570 feet above sea-level, and Arenig Mawr,\r\n2,817 feet high, is eighteen miles to the eastward, and a broad, deep\r\nvalley with unobstructed access to Cardigan Bay intervenes; so, if any\r\nice from the central mass made its way over the Snowdonian range, it\r\nperformed a much more surprising feat than that involved in the ascent of\r\nMoel Tryfaen from the westward.\r\n\r\n\"The profile shows in diagrammatic form the probable relations of the\r\nforeign to the native ice at the time when the Moel Tryfaen deposits were\r\nlaid down.\r\n\r\n\"From what has been said regarding the great glaciers, it would seem\r\nthat ice advanced upon the land from the seaward in several parts of the\r\ncoast of England, Wales, and the Isle of Man. Now, it is in precisely\r\nthose parts of the country, and those alone, that the remains of marine\r\nanimals occur in the glacial deposits. If the dispersal of the shells\r\nfound in the drift had been effected by the means I have suggested, it\r\nwould follow, as an inevitable consequence, that wherever shells occur\r\nthere should also be boulders which have been brought from beyond the\r\nsea. This I find to be the case, and in two instances the discovery of\r\nshells was preliminary to the extension of the boundaries of the known\r\ndistribution of boulders of trans-marine origin.\r\n\r\n\"The officers of the Geological Survey some years ago observed the\r\noccurrence of 'obscure fragments of marine shells' in a deposit at\r\nWhalley, Lancashire, in which they could find only local rocks. One case\r\nsuch as this would be fatal to the theory of the _remanié_ origin of the\r\nshells, but on visiting the section with Mr. W. A. Downham, I found,\r\namongst the very few stones which occurred in the shell-bearing sand at\r\nthe spot indicated, two well-marked examples of Cumbrian volcanic rocks,\r\nand, at a little distance, large boulders of Scottish granites.\r\n\r\n\"The second case is more striking. The announcement was made that shells\r\nhad been found on a hill called Gloppa near Oswestry, in Shropshire, and,\r\nas it lay about five miles to the westward of Mackintosh's boundary of\r\nthe Irish Sea Glacier, and therefore well within the area of exclusively\r\nWelsh boulders, it furnished an excellent opportunity of putting the\r\ntheory to the test. An examination of the boulders associated with the\r\nshells showed that the whole suite of Galloway and Cumbrian erratics\r\nsuch as belong to the Irish Sea Glacier were present in great abundance.\r\nNot only this, but in the midst of the series of shell-bearing gravels I\r\nobserved a thin lenticular bed of greenish clay, which upon examination\r\nwas found to be crowded with well-scratched specimens of Welsh rocks; but\r\nneither a morsel of shell nor a single pebble of a foreign rock could be\r\nfound, either by a careful examination in the field or by washing the\r\nclay at home, and examining with a lens the sand and stones separated out.\r\n\r\n\"The fact that predictions such as these have been verified affords a\r\nvery striking corroboration of the theory put forward; and, though shells\r\ncannot be found in every deposit in which they might, _ex hypothesi_,\r\nbe found, yet the strict limitation of them to situations which conform\r\nto those assigned upon theoretical grounds cannot be ascribed to mere\r\ncoincidence. If the land had ever been submerged during any part of\r\nthe Glacial epoch to a depth of 1,400 feet, it is inconceivable that\r\nclear and indisputable evidence should not be found in abundance in the\r\nsheltered valleys of the Lake District and Wales, which would have been\r\ndeep, quiet fiords, in which vast colonies of marine creatures would have\r\nfound harbour, as they do in the deep lochs of Scotland to-day.\r\n\r\n\"It has been urged, in explanation of this absence of marine remains\r\nin the great hill-centres, that the 'second glaciation' might have\r\ndestroyed them; but to do this would require that the ice should make a\r\nclean and complete sweep of all the loose deposits both in the hollows\r\nof the valleys and on the hill-sides, and further that it should destroy\r\nall the shells and all the foreign stones which floated in during the\r\nsubmergence. At the same time we should have to suppose that the drift\r\nwhich lay in the paths of the great glaciers was not subjected to any\r\ninterference whatever. But, assuming that these difficulties were\r\nexplained, there would still remain the fact that the valleys which have\r\nnever been glaciated--as, for example, those of Derbyshire--show no\r\nsigns whatever of any marine deposits, nor of marine action in any form\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n\"The sea leaves other traces also, besides shells, of its presence\r\nin districts that have really been submerged, yet there are no signs\r\nwhatever to be found of them in all England, except the _post_-glacial\r\nraised beaches. Furthermore, in all the area occupied by glacial\r\ndeposits there are no true sea-beaches, no cliffs nor sea-worn caves,\r\nno barnacle-encrusted rocks, nor rocks bored by Pholas or Saxicava. Are\r\nwe to believe that these never existed; or that, having existed, they\r\nhave been obliterated by subsequent denudations? To make good the former\r\nproposition, it would be necessary as a preliminary to show that the\r\nmovement of subsidence and re-elevation was so rapid, and the interval\r\nbetween so brief, that no time was allowed for any marine erosion to\r\ntake place. If this were so, it would be the most stupendous catastrophe\r\nof which we have any geological record; but we are not left in doubt\r\nregarding the duration of the submerged condition, for the occurrence\r\nof forty feet of gravel upon the summits of the hills indicates plainly\r\nthat, if they were accumulated by the sea, the land must have stood at\r\nthat level for a very long period, amply sufficient for the formation of\r\na well-marked coast-line.\r\n\r\n\"The alternative proposition, that post-glacial denudation had removed\r\nthe traces of subsidence, is equally at variance with the evidence.\r\nPost-glacial denudation has left kames and drumlins, and all the other\r\nforms of glacial deposits, in almost perfect integrity; the small\r\nkettle-holes are not yet filled up; and it is therefore quite out of the\r\nquestion that the far more enduring features, such as sea-cliffs, shore\r\nplatforms, and beaches, should have been destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"The only reasonable conclusion is, that these evidences of marine action\r\nnever existed, because the land in glacial times was never depressed\r\nbelow its present level. If the level were different at all (as I think\r\nmay have been the case on the western side of England), it was higher,\r\nand not lower.\r\n\r\n\"The details of the submergence hypothesis have, so far as I am aware,\r\nnever been dealt with by its advocates, otherwise I cannot but think that\r\nit would have been abandoned long since. It has been stated in general\r\nterms that the subsidence was greatest in the north and diminished to\r\nzero in the south, but no attempt was made to trace the evidence of\r\nextreme subsidence across country and along the principal hill-ranges--in\r\nfact, to see how it varied in every direction.\r\n\r\n\"If we take a traverse of England, say from Flamborough Head upon the\r\neast to Moel Tryfaen on the west, and accept as evidence of submergence\r\nany true glacial deposits (except, as in the case of the interior of\r\nWales, the deposits are obviously the effects of purely local glaciers\r\nand contain, therefore, no shells), we shall find that the subsidence, if\r\nany, must have been not simply differential but sporadic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Section of the cliff on the east side of South\r\nSea Landing, Flamborough Head.

The Yorkshire Wolds were not submerged. On the\r\nwestern flanks of the wolds drift comes in at about 100 to 150 feet, and\r\npersists, probably, under the post-glacial warp, from which it again\r\nprotrudes on the western side of the valley of the Ouse, and however the\r\ndrift between there and the Pennine water-shed may be interpreted, it\r\nshows not a sign of marine origin; but, even granting that it did, we\r\nfind that it does not reach within a thousand feet of the water-shed.\r\nWhen the water-shed is crossed, however, abundant glacial deposits are\r\nmet with which are not to be differentiated from others at slightly lower\r\nlevels which contain shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Enlarged section of the shelly sand and\r\nsurrounding clay at _B_ in preceding figure.

Across the great plain of Lancashire and Cheshire\r\nthe 'marine' drift is fully developed--though it may be remarked in\r\nparentheses that it contains a shallow-water fauna, albeit _ex hypothesi_\r\ndeposited, in part at least, in a depth of 200 fathoms of water--and to\r\nthe Welsh border at Frondeg, where it again reaches a water-shed at an\r\naltitude of 1,450 feet; but at 100 yards to the westward of the summit\r\nall traces of subsidence disappear, and through the centre of Wales no\r\nsign is visible; then we emerge on the western slopes at Moel Tryfaen,\r\nand they assume their fullest dimensions, though only to finish abruptly\r\non the hill-top, and put in no appearance in the lower grounds which\r\nextend from there to the sea.\r\n\r\n\"The conclusions pointed to by the evidence (and, as I have endeavoured\r\nto show, all the evidence which existed at the close of the Glacial\r\nperiod is there still) are, that a subsidence of the Yorkshire Wolds\r\ntook place on the east, but not in the centre or west; that the Pennine\r\nChain was submerged on the western side to a depth of 1,400 feet, and\r\non the east to not more than 300 feet, even on opposite sides of the\r\nsame individual hill; that all the lowlands between, say, Bacup and the\r\nWelsh border, were submerged, and that the hills near Frondeg partook of\r\nthis movement, but only on their eastern sides; that the centre of Wales\r\nwas exempt, but that the summit of Moel Tryfaen forms an isolated spot\r\nsubmerged, while the surrounding country escaped. These absurdities might\r\nbe indefinitely multiplied, and they must follow unless it be admitted\r\nthat the phenomena are the results of glacial ice, and that ice can move\r\n'up-hill.'\r\n\r\n\"The south of England certainly has partaken of no movement of\r\nsubsidence. A line drawn from Bristol to London will leave all the true\r\nglacial deposits to the northward, except a bed of very questionable\r\nboulder-clay at Watchet, and a peculiar deposit of clayey rubble which\r\nhas been produced on the flanks of the Cornish hills probably, as the\r\nlate S. V. Wood, Jr, suggested, by the slipping of material over a\r\npermanently frozen subsoil.\r\n\r\n\"For the remainder of the southern area the evidence is plain that there\r\nhas been no considerable subsidence during glacial times. The presence\r\nover large areas of chalk country of the 'clay with flints'--a deposit\r\nproduced by the gradual solution of the chalk and the accumulation in\r\nsitu of its insoluble residue--is absolute demonstration that for immense\r\nperiods of time the country has been exempt from any considerable aqueous\r\naction. The enormous accumulations of china clay upon the granite bosses\r\nof Cornwall and Devon tell the same tale. A few erratics have been found\r\nat low levels at various points on the southern coasts, usually not\r\nabove the reach of the waves. These consist of rocks which may have been\r\nfloated by shore-ice from the Channel Islands or the French coast.\r\n\r\n\"This imperfect survey of the evidence against the supposed submergence\r\nhas been rendered the more difficult by the fact that it is not\r\nconsidered necessary to produce the evidence of marine shells in all\r\ncases. Indeed, it has been argued that post-Tertiary beds covering\r\nthousands of square miles might be absolutely destitute of shells without\r\nprejudice to the theory of their formation in the sea.\r\n\r\n\"But such a suggestion, one would think, could hardly come from anyone\r\nfamiliar with marine Tertiary deposits, or even with the appearance of\r\nmodern sea-beaches. Admitting, however, for the purposes of argument,\r\nthat the beaches along a great extent of coast might be devoid of shells,\r\nit cannot be argued that the deep waters were destitute of life; and\r\nhence the boulder-clays, if of marine origin, should contain a great\r\nabundance of shells and other remains, and, once entombed, it is beyond\r\nbelief that they could all be removed from such a deposit in the short\r\nlapse of post-glacial time.\r\n\r\n\"Now, some of the boulder-clays--as, for example, those of Lancashire\r\nand Cheshire--are held to be of marine origin, and this is indeed\r\na vital necessity to the submergence theory; for, if these are not\r\nmarine deposits, neither are the other shelly deposits; but these\r\nboulder-clays are absolutely indistinguishable from those lying within\r\nthe hill-centres, and, as it passes belief that such deposits could be of\r\ndiverse origin and yet possess an identical structure and arrangement,\r\nthen we should have a right to demand that these clays should have\r\nenclosed shells and should still contain them, but they do not.\r\n\r\n\"I may here mention that I am informed by Mr. W. Shone, F. G. S.--and\r\nhe was good enough to permit me to quote the statement--that the\r\nboulder-clay of Cheshire and the shelly boulder-clay of Caithness are 'as\r\nlike as two peas.' The importance of this comparison lies in the fact\r\nthat, since Croll's classical description, all observers have agreed\r\nthat it was the product of land-ice which moved in upon the land out of\r\nthe Dornoch Firth. It was pointed out then, as since has been done for\r\nEngland, that it was only where the direction of ice-movement was from\r\nthe seaward that any shells occur in the boulder-clay.\r\n\r\n\"_The Dispersion of Erratics of Shap Granite._--So great a significance\r\nattaches to the peculiar distribution of this remarkable rock, that I\r\nmay add a few details here which could not be conveniently introduced\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\"This granite occupies an area which lies just to the northward of the\r\nwater-shed between the basins of the Lime and the Eden, and its extreme\r\nelevation is 1,656 feet. Boulders occur in large numbers as far to the\r\nnorthward as Cross Fells, while, as already described, they pass over\r\nStainmoor and are dispersed in great numbers along the route taken by the\r\ngreat Stainmoor branch of the Solway Glacier. But a considerable number\r\nof the boulders also found their way to the southward, and a well-marked\r\ntrail can be followed down into Morecambe Bay; and at Hest Bank, to the\r\nnorth of Lancaster, the boulder-clay contains many examples, together\r\nwith the 'mica-trap' of the Kendal and Sedbergh dykes and other local\r\nrocks, but no shells or erratics from other sources than the country\r\ndraining into Morecambe Bay. To the southward the ice which bore these\r\nrocks was deflected by the great Irish Sea Glacier, and, so far as\r\npresent information enables me to state, the Shap granite blocks mark the\r\ncourse of the medial moraine between these two ice-streams. It has been\r\nfound near Garstang, at Longridge, and at Whalley, this being the exact\r\nline of junction of the Irish Sea Glacier with the ice from Morecambe Bay\r\nand the Pennine Chain.\r\n\r\n\"It is a very remarkable and significant fact, that not a single\r\nauthentic occurrence of the rock across the boundary indicated has yet\r\nbeen recorded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Northern Europe._\r\n\r\nOn passing over the shallow German Sea from England to the Continent,\r\nthe southern border of the Scandinavian ice-field is found south of\r\nthe Zuyder Zee, between Utrecht and Arnhem--the moraine hills in the\r\nvicinity of Arnhem being quite marked, and a barren, sandy plain dotted\r\nwith boulders and irregular moraine hills extending most of the way to\r\nthe Zuyder Zee. From Arnhem the southern boundary of the great ice-field\r\nruns \"eastward across the Rhine Valley, along the base of the Westphalian\r\nHills, around the projecting promontory of the Hartz, and then southward\r\nthrough Saxony to the roots of the Erzgebirge. Passing next southeastward\r\nalong the flanks of the Riesen and Sudeten chain, it sweeps across Poland\r\ninto Russia, circling round by Kiev, and northward by Nijni-Novgorod\r\ntowards the Urals.\"[BV] Thence the boundary passes northward to the\r\nArctic Ocean, a little east of the White Sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote BV: A. Geikie's Text-Book of Geology, p. 885.]\r\n\r\nThe depth of this northern ice-sheet is proved to have been upwards\r\nof 1,400 feet where it met the Hartz Mountains, for it has deposited\r\nnorthern _débris_ upon them to that height; while, as already shown, it\r\nmust have been over 2,000 feet in the main valley of Switzerland. In\r\nNorway it is estimated that the ice was between 6,000 and 7,000 feet\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work done by the continental glaciers of Europe in the\r\nerosion, transportation, and deposition of rock and earthy material is\r\nimmense. According to Helland, the average depth of the glacial deposits\r\nover North Germany and northwestern Russia is 150 German feet, i. e.,\r\nabout 135 English feet. As the deposition towards the margin of a glacier\r\nmust be commensurate with its erosion near the centre of movement, this\r\nvast amount implies a still greater proportionate waste in the mountains\r\nof Scandinavia, where the area diminishes with every contraction of\r\nthe circle. Two hundred and fifty feet is therefore not an extravagant\r\ncalculation for the amount of glacial erosion in the Scandinavian\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to see how the Scandinavian mountains were able\r\nto contribute so much soil to the plains of northern Germany and\r\nnorthwestern Russia. Previous to the Glacial period, a warm climate\r\nextended so far north as to permit the growth of semi-tropical vegetation\r\nin Spitsbergen, Greenland, and the northern shores of British America.\r\nSuch a climate, with its abundant moisture and vegetation, afforded most\r\nfavourable conditions for the superficial disintegration of the rocks.\r\nWhen, therefore, the cold of the Glacial period came on, the moving\r\ncurrents of ice would have a comparatively easy task in stripping the\r\nmantle of soil from the hills of Norway and Sweden, and transporting it\r\ntowards the periphery of its movement. Of course, erosion in Scandinavia\r\nmeant subglacial deposition beyond the Baltic. Doubtless, therefore, the\r\nplains of northern Germany, with their great depth of soil, are true\r\nglacial deposits, whose inequalities of surface have since been much\r\nobliterated, through the general influences of the lapse of time, and by\r\nthe ceaseless activity of man.\r\n\r\nAn interesting series of moraines in the north of Germany, bordering the\r\nBaltic Sea, was discovered in 1888 by Professor Salisbury, of the United\r\nStates Geological Survey. Its course lies through Schleswig-Holstein,\r\nMecklenburg, Potsdam (about forty miles north of Berlin), thence swinging\r\nmore to the north, and following nearly the line between Pomerania and\r\nWest Prussia, crossing the Vistula about twenty miles south of Dantzic,\r\nthence easterly to the Spirding See, near the boundary of Poland.\r\n\r\nAmong the places where this moraine can be best seen are--\"1. In Province\r\nHolstein, the region about (especially north of) Eutin; 2. Province\r\nMecklenburg, north of Crivitz, and between Bütow and Kröpelin; 3.\r\nProvince Brandenburg, south of Reckatel, between Strassen and Bärenbusch,\r\nsouth of Fürstenberg and north of Everswalde, and between Pyritz and\r\nSolden; 4. Province Posen, east of Locknitz, and at numerous points to\r\nthe south, and especially about Falkenburg, and between Lompelburg and\r\nBärwalde. This is one of the best localities. 5. Province West Preussen,\r\neast of Bütow; 6. Province Ost Preussen, between Horn and Widikin.\"\r\n\r\nComparing these with the moraines of America, Professor Salisbury remarks:\r\n\r\n\"In its composition from several members, in its variety of development,\r\nin its topographic relations, in its topography, in its constitution, in\r\nits associated deposits, and in its wide separation from the outermost\r\ndrift limit, this morainic belt corresponds to the extensive morainic\r\nbelt of America, which extends from Dakota to the Atlantic Ocean. That\r\nthe one formation corresponds to the other does not admit of doubt. In\r\nall essential characteristics they are identical in character. What may\r\nbe their relations in time remains to be determined.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Map showing the glaciated area of Europe\r\naccording to J. Geikie, and the moraines in Britain and Germany according\r\nto Lewis and Salisbury.]\r\n\r\nThe physical geography of Europe is so different from that of America,\r\nthat there was a marked difference in the secondary or incidental effects\r\nof the Glacial period upon the two regions. In America the continental\r\narea over which the glaciers spread is comparatively simple in its\r\noutlines. East of the Rocky Mountains, as we have seen, the drainage\r\nof the Glacial period was, for a time, nearly all concentrated in the\r\nMississippi basin, and the streams had a free course southward.\r\n\r\nBut in Europe there was no free drainage to the south, except over\r\na small portion of the glaciated area in central Russia, about the\r\nhead-waters of the Dnieper, the Don, and the Volga; though the Danube\r\nand the Rhône afforded free course for the waters of a portion of the\r\ngreat Alpine glaciers. But all the great rivers of northern Europe\r\nflow to the northward, and, with the exception of the Seine, they all\r\nfor a time encountered the front of the continental ice-sheet. This\r\ncircumstance makes it difficult to distinguish closely between the direct\r\nglacial deposits in Europe and those which are more or less modified\r\nby water-action. At first sight it would seem also somewhat hazardous\r\nto attempt to correlate with any portion of the Glacial period the\r\ndeposition of the gravelly and loamy deposits in valleys, which, like\r\nthose of the Seine and Somme, lie entirely outside of the glaciated area.\r\n\r\nUpon close examination, however, the elements of doubt more and more\r\ndisappear. The Glacial period was one of great precipitation, and it\r\nis natural to suppose that the area of excessive snow-fall extended\r\nconsiderably beyond the limit of the ice-front. During that period\r\ntherefore, the rivers of central France must have been annually flooded\r\nto an extent far beyond anything which is known at the present time.\r\nSince these rivers flowed to the northward, at a period when, during\r\nthe long and severe winters, the annual accumulation of ice near their\r\nmouths was excessive, ice-gorges of immense extent, such as now form\r\nabout the mouths of the Siberian rivers, would regularly occur. We are\r\nnot surprised, therefore, to find, even in these streams, abundant\r\nindications of the indirect influence of the great northern ice-sheet.\r\n\r\nThe indications referred to consist of high-level gravel terraces\r\noccasionally containing boulders, of from four to five tons weight, which\r\nhave been transported for a considerable distance. The elevation of the\r\nterraces above the present flood-plains of the Seine and Somme reaches\r\nfrom 100 to 150 feet. We are not to suppose, however, that even in\r\nglacial times the floods of the river Seine could have filled its present\r\nvalley to that height. The highest flood in this river known in historic\r\ntimes rose only to a height of twenty-nine feet. Mr. Prestwich estimates\r\nthat, without taking into consideration the more rapid discharge, a flood\r\nof sixty times this magnitude would be required to fill the present\r\nvalley to the level of the ancient gravels, while at Amiens the shape of\r\nthe valley of the Somme is such that five hundred times the mean average\r\nof the stream would be required to reach the high-level gravels. The\r\nconclusion, therefore, is that the troughs of these streams have been\r\nlargely formed by erosion since the deposition of the high-level gravels.\r\n\r\nConnected with these terrace gravels in northern France is a loamy\r\ndeposit, corresponding to the loess in other parts of Europe, and to a\r\nsimilar deposit to which we have referred in describing the southwestern\r\npart of the glaciated area in North America. In northern France this fine\r\nsilt overlies the high-level gravel deposits, and, as Mr. Prestwich has\r\npretty clearly shown, was deposited contemporaneously with them during\r\nthe early inundations and before the stream had eroded its channel to its\r\npresent level.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of loess in Europe was doubtless connected with the\r\npeculiar glacial conditions of the continent. Its typical development\r\nis in the valley of the Rhine, where it is described by Professor\r\nJames Geikie \"as a yellow or pale greyish-brown, fine-grained, and\r\nmore or less homogeneous, consistent, non-plastic loam, consisting of\r\nan intimate admixture of clay and carbonate of lime. It is frequently\r\nminutely perforated by long, vertical, root-like tubes which are lined\r\nwith carbonate of lime--a structure which imparts to the loess a strong\r\ntendency to cleave or divide in vertical planes. Thus it usually presents\r\nupright bluffs or cliffs upon the margins of streams and rivers which\r\nintersect it. Very often it contains concretions or nodules of irregular\r\nform.... Land-shells and the remains of land animals are the most common\r\nfossils of the loess, but occasionally fresh-water shells and the bones\r\nof fresh-water fish occur.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the margins of the modern alluvial flats which form the bottoms\r\nof the valleys it rises to a height of 200 or 300 feet above the\r\nstreams--sweeping up the slopes of the valleys, and imparting a rich\r\nproductiveness to many districts which would otherwise be comparatively\r\nunfruitful. From the Rhienthal itself it extends into all the tributary\r\nvalleys--those of the Neckar, the Main, the Lahn, the Moselle, and the\r\nMeuse, being more or less abundantly charged with it. It spreads, in\r\nshort, like a great winding-sheet over the country--lying thickly in the\r\nvalleys and dying off upon the higher slopes and plateaux. Wide and deep\r\naccumulations appear likewise in the Rhône Valley, as also in several\r\nother river-valleys of France, as in those of the Seine, the Saône, and\r\nthe Garonne, and the same is the case with many of the valleys of middle\r\nGermany, such as those of the Fulda, the Werra, the Weser, and the upper\r\nreaches of the great basin of the Elbe. It must not be supposed that the\r\nloess is restricted to valleys and depressions in the surface of the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that it attains in these its greatest thickness, but\r\nextensive accumulations may often be followed far into the intermediate\r\nhilly districts and over the neighbouring plateaux. Thus the Odenwald,\r\nthe Taunus, the Vogelgebirge, and other upland tracts, are cloaked with\r\nloess up to a considerable height. Crossing into the drainage system of\r\nthe Danube, we find that this large river and many of its tributaries\r\nflow through vast tracts of loess. Lower Bavaria is thickly coated with\r\nit, and it attains a great development in Bohemia, Upper and Lower\r\nAustria, and Moravia--in the latter country rising to an elevation of\r\n1,300 feet. It is equally abundant in Hungary, Galicia, Bukowina, and\r\nTransylvania. From the Danubian flat lands and the low grounds of Galicia\r\nit stretches into the valleys of the Carpathians, up to heights of 800\r\nand 2,000 feet. In some cases it goes even higher--namely, to 3,000\r\nfeet, according to Zeuschner, and to 4,000 or 5,000 feet, according to\r\nKorzistka. These last great elevations, it will be understood, are in\r\nthe upper valleys of the northern Carpathians. In Roumania loess is\r\nlikewise plentiful, but it has not been observed south of the Balkans.\r\nEast of the Carpathians--that is to say, in the regions watered by the\r\nDniester, the Dnieper, and the Don--loess appears also to be wanting,\r\nand to be represented by those great steppe-deposits which are known as\r\n_Tchernozen_, or black earth.\"[BW]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BW: Prehistoric Europe, pp. 144-146.]\r\n\r\nThe shells found in the loess indicate both a colder and a wetter climate\r\nduring its deposition than that which now exists. The relics of land\r\nanimals are infrequently found in the deposit, yet they do occur, but\r\nmostly in fragmentary condition--the principal animals represented being\r\nthe mammoth, the rhinoceros, the reindeer, and the horse; which is about\r\nthe same variety as is found in the gravel deposits of the Glacial\r\nperiod, both in western Europe and in America.\r\n\r\nA species of loess--differing, however, somewhat in color from that on\r\nthe Rhine--covers the plains of northeastern France up to an elevation of\r\n700 feet above the the sea, where, as we have already said, it overlies\r\nthe high-level gravels of the Seine and the Somme. Above this height\r\nthe superficial soil in France is evidently merely the decomposed upper\r\nsurface of the native rock.\r\n\r\nThe probable explanation of all these deposits, included under the term\r\n\"loess,\" is the same as that already given by Prestwich of the loamy\r\ndeposits of northern France. But in case of rivers, which, like the\r\nRhine, encountered the ice-front in their northward flow, a flooded\r\ncondition favouring the accumulation of loess was doubtless promoted by\r\nthe continental ice-barrier. In the case of the Danube and the Rhône,\r\nhowever, where there was a free outlet away from the glaciated region,\r\nthe loess in the upper part of the valleys must have accumulated in\r\nconnection with glacial floods quite similar to those which we have\r\ndescribed as spreading over the imperfectly formed water-courses of the\r\nMississippi basin during the close of the Ice age. That the typical loess\r\nis of glacial origin is pretty certainly shown, both by its distribution\r\nin front of glaciers and by its evident mechanical origin when studied\r\nunder the microscope. It is, in short, the fine sediment which gives the\r\nmilky whiteness to glacial rivers.\r\n\r\nIn central Russia there is a considerable area in which the glacial\r\nconditions were, in one respect, similar to those in the northern part\r\nof the Mississippi Valley in the United States. In both regions the\r\ncontinental ice-sheet surmounted the river partings, and spread over the\r\nupper portion of an extensive plain whose drainage was to the south. The\r\nDnieper, the Don, and the western branch of the Volga, like the Ohio\r\nand the Mississippi, have their head-waters in the glaciated region. In\r\nsome other respects, also, there is a resemblance between the plains\r\nbordering the glaciated region in central Russia and those which in\r\nAmerica border it in the Mississippi Valley. Mr. James Geikie is of the\r\nopinion that the extensive belt of black earth adjoining the glaciated\r\narea in Russia, and constituting the most productive agricultural portion\r\nof the country, derives its fertility, as does much of the Mississippi\r\nValley, from the blanket of glacial silt spread pretty evenly over it.\r\nThus it would appear that in Europe, as in America, the ice of the\r\nGlacial period was a most beneficent agent, preparing the face of the\r\nearth for the permanent occupation of man. On both continents the seat\r\nof empire is in the area once occupied by the advance of the great\r\nice-movements of that desolate epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Asia._\r\n\r\nEast of the Urals, in northern Asia, there is no evidence of moving ice\r\nupon the land during the Glacial period; but at Yakutsk, in latitude 62°\r\nnorth, the soil is frozen at the present time to an unknown depth, and\r\nmany of the Siberian rivers, as they approach and empty into the Arctic\r\nSea, flow between cliffs of perpetual ice or frozen ground. The changes\r\nthat came over this region during the Glacial period are impressively\r\nindicated by the animal remains which have been preserved in these\r\nmotionless icy cliffs. In the early part of the period herds of mammoth\r\nand woolly rhinoceros roamed over the plains of Siberia, and waged an\r\nunequal warfare with the slowly converging and destructive forces. The\r\nheads and tusks of these animals were so abundant in Siberia that they\r\nlong supplied all Russia with ivory, besides contributing no small\r\namount for export to other countries. \"In 1872 and 1873 as many as 2,770\r\nmammoth-tusks, weighing from 140 to 160 pounds each, were entered at the\r\nLondon clocks.\"[BX] So perfectly have the carcasses of these extinct\r\nanimals been preserved in the frozen soil of northern Siberia that when,\r\nafter the lapse of thousands of years, floods have washed them out from\r\nthe frozen cliffs, dogs and wolves and bears have fed upon their flesh\r\nwith avidity. In some instances even \"portions of the food of these\r\nanimals were found in the cavities of the teeth. Microscopic examination\r\nshowed that they fed upon the leaves and shoots of the coniferous trees\r\nwhich then clothed the plains of Siberia.\" A skeleton and parts of\r\nthe skin, and some of the softer portions of the body of a mammoth,\r\ndiscovered in 1799 in the frozen cliff near the mouth of the Lena, was\r\ncarried to St. Petersburg in 1806, from which it was ascertained that\r\nthis huge animal was \"covered with alight-coloured, curly, very thick-set\r\nhair one to two inches in length, interspersed with darker-colored hair\r\nand bristles from four to eighteen inches long.\"[BY]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BX: Prestwich's Geology, vol. ii, p. 460.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BY: Prestwich's Geology, vol. ii, p. 460.]\r\n\r\nIn the valleys of Sikkim and eastern Nepaul, in northern India, glaciers\r\nformerly extended 6,000 feet lower than now, or to about the 5,000-foot\r\nlevel, and in the western Himalayas to a still lower level. The higher\r\nranges of mountains in other portions of Asia also show many signs of\r\nformer glaciation. This is specially true of the Caucasus, where the\r\nancient glaciers were of vast extent. According, also, to Sir Joseph\r\nHooker, the cedars of Lebanon flourish upon an ancient moraine. Of the\r\nglacial phenomena in other portions of Asia little is known.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Africa._\r\n\r\nNorthern and even central Africa must likewise come in for their share\r\nof attention. The Atlas Mountains, rising to a height of 13,000 feet,\r\nthough supporting none at the present time, formerly sustained glaciers\r\nof considerable size. Moraines are found in several places as low as the\r\n4,000-foot level, and one at an altitude of 4,000 feet is from 800 to 900\r\nfeet high, and completely crosses and dams up the ravine down which the\r\nglacier formerly came.\r\n\r\nSome have supposed that there are indubitable evidences of former\r\nglaciation in the mountain-ranges of southwestern Africa between latitude\r\n30° and 33°, but the evidence is not as unequivocal as we could wish, and\r\nwe will not pause upon it.\r\n\r\nThe mountains of _Australia_, also, some of which rise to a height of\r\nmore than 7,000 feet, are supposed to have been once covered with glacial\r\nice down to the level of 5,800 feet, but the evidence is at present too\r\nscanty to build upon. But in _New Zealand_ the glaciers now clustering\r\nabout the peaks in the middle of the South Island, culminating in Mount\r\nCook, are but diminutive representatives of their predecessors. This is\r\nindicated by extensive moraines in the lower part of the valleys and by\r\nthe existence of numerous lakes, attributable, like so many in Europe and\r\nNorth America, to the irregular deposition of morainic material by the\r\nancient ice-sheet.[BZ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote BZ: See With Axe and Rope in the New Zealand Alps, by G. E.\r\nMannering, 1891.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND THE GLACIAL PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will begin the consideration of this part of our subject, also, with\r\nthe presentation of the salient facts in North America, since that field\r\nis simpler than any field in the Old World.\r\n\r\nThe natural drainage basins of North America east of the Rocky Mountains\r\nare readily described. The Mississippi River and its branches drain\r\nnearly all the region lying between the Appalachian chain and the Rocky\r\nMountains and south of the Dominion of Canada and of the Great Lakes.\r\nAll the southern tributaries to the Great Lakes are insignificant, the\r\nriver partings on the south being reached in a very short distance. The\r\ndrainage of the rather limited basin of the Great Lakes is northeastward\r\nthrough the St. Lawrence River, leaving nearly all of the Dominion of\r\nCanada east of the Rocky Mountains to pour its surplus waters northward\r\ninto Hudson Bay and the Arctic Ocean. With the exception of the St.\r\nLawrence River, these are essentially permanent systems of drainage. To\r\nunderstand the extent to which the ice of the Glacial period modified\r\nthese systems, we must first get before our minds a picture of the\r\ncountry before the accumulation of ice began.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preglacial Erosion._\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the elevated condition of the northern\r\nand central parts of North America at the beginning of the Glacial\r\nperiod. The direct proof of this preglacial elevation is largely derived\r\nfrom the fiords and great lake basins of the continent. The word \"fiord\"\r\nis descriptive of the deep and narrow inlets of the sea specially\r\ncharacteristic of the coasts of Norway, Denmark. Iceland, and British\r\nColumbia. Usually also fiords are connected with valleys extending still\r\nfarther inland, and occupied by streams.\r\n\r\nFiords are probably due in great part to river erosion when the shores\r\nstood at considerably higher level than now. Slowly, during the course\r\nof ages, the streams wore out for themselves immense gorges, and were\r\nassisted, perhaps, to some extent by the glaciers which naturally came\r\ninto existence during the higher continental elevation. The present\r\ncondition of fiords, occupied as they usually are by great depths of\r\nsea-water, would be accounted for by recent subsidence of the land. In\r\nshort, fiords seem essentially to be submerged river gorges, partially\r\nsilted up near their mouths, or perhaps partially closed by terminal\r\nmoraines.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone in northwestern Europe and British Columbia that fiords\r\nare found, but they characterize as well the eastern coast of America\r\nnorth of Maine, while even farther south, both on the Atlantic and on\r\nthe Pacific coast, some extensive examples exist, whose course has been\r\nrevealed only to the sounding-line of the Government survey.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the submerged fiords in the middle Atlantic region\r\nof the United States is the continuation of the trough of Hudson River\r\nbeyond New York Bay. As long ago as 1844 the work of the United States\r\nCoast Survey showed that there was a submarine continuation of this\r\nvalley, extending through the comparatively shallow waters eighty miles\r\nor more seaward from Sandy Hook.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Map showing old channel and mouth of the Hudson\r\n(dewberry).]\r\n\r\nThe more accurate surveys conducted from 1880 to 1884 have brought to\r\nour knowledge the facts about this submarine valley almost as clearly\r\nas those relating to the inland portion of it above New York city.\r\nAccording to Mr. A. Lindenkohl,[CA] this submarine valley began to be\r\nnoticeable in the soundings ten miles southeast of Sandy Hook. The depth\r\nof the water where the channel begins is nineteen fathoms (114 feet).\r\nTen miles out the channel has sunk ninety feet below the general depth\r\nof the water on the bank, and continues at this depth for twenty miles\r\nfarther. This narrow channel continues with more or less variation for\r\na distance of seventy-five miles, where it suddenly enlarges to a width\r\nof three miles and to a depth of 200 fathoms, or 1,200 feet, and extends\r\nfor a distance of twenty-five miles, reaching near that point a depth\r\nof 474 fathoms, or 2,844 feet. According to Mr. Lindenkohl, this ravine\r\nmaintains for half its length \"a vertical depth of more than 2,000 feet,\r\nmeasuring from the top of its banks, and the banks have a nearly uniform\r\nslope of about 14°.\" The mouth of the ravine opens out into the deep\r\nbasin of the central Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote CA: Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, vol. i, p.\r\n564; American Journal of Science, June, 1891.]\r\n\r\nWith little question there is brought to light in these remarkable\r\ninvestigations a channel eroded by the extension of the Hudson River,\r\ninto the bordering shelf of the Atlantic basin at a time when the\r\nelevation of the continent was much greater than now. This is shown to\r\nhave occurred in late Tertiary or post-Tertiary times by the fact that\r\nthe strata through which it is worn are the continuation of the Tertiary\r\ndeposits of New Jersey. The subsidence to its present level has probably\r\nbeen gradual, and, according to Professor Cook, is still continuing at\r\nthe rate of two feet a century.\r\n\r\nSimilar submarine channels are found extending out from the present\r\nshore-line to the margin of the narrow shelf bordering the deep water of\r\nthe central Atlantic running from the mouth of the St. Lawrence River,\r\nthrough St. Lawrence Bay, and through Delaware and Chesapeake Bays.[CB]\r\nAll these submerged fiords on the Atlantic coast were probably formed\r\nduring a continental elevation which commenced late in the Tertiary\r\nperiod, and reached the amount of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet in the\r\nnorthern part of the continent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote CB: See Lindenkohl in American Journal of Science, for June,\r\n1891.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--New York harbor in preglacial times looking\r\nsouth, from south end of New York Island (Newberry).]\r\n\r\nTo this period must probably be referred also the formation of the gorge,\r\nor more properly fiord, of the Saguenay, which joins the St. Lawrence\r\nbelow Quebec. The great depth of this fiord is certainly surprising,\r\nsince, according to Sir William Dawson, its bottom, for fifty miles above\r\nthe St. Lawrence, is 840 feet below the sea-level, while the bordering\r\ncliffs are in some places 1,500 feet above the water. The average width\r\nis something over a mile.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to account for such a deep gorge extending so far\r\nbelow the sea-level, except upon the supposition of a long-continued\r\ncontinental elevation, which should allow the stream to form a cañon to\r\nan extent somewhat comparable with that of the cañons of the Colorado and\r\nother rivers in the far West. Then, upon the subsidence of the continent\r\nto the present level, it would remain partially or wholly submerged,\r\nas we find it at the present time. During the Glacial period it was so\r\nfilled with ice as to prevent silting up. The rivers entering the Pacific\r\nOcean, both in the United States and in British Columbia, are also lost\r\nin submerged channels extending out to the deeper waters of the Pacific\r\nbasin in a manner closely similar to the Atlantic streams which have been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nDuring this continental elevation which preceded, accompanied, and\r\nperhaps brought on the Glacial period, erosion must have proceeded with\r\ngreat intensity along all the lines of drainage, and throughout the whole\r\nregion which is now covered, and to a considerable extent smoothed over,\r\nby glacial deposits, and the whole country must have presented a very\r\ndifferent appearance from what it does now.\r\n\r\nA pretty definite idea of its preglacial condition can probably be formed\r\nby studying the appearance of the regions outside of and adjoining that\r\nwhich was covered by the continental glacier. The contrast between the\r\nglaciated and the unglaciated region is striking in several respects\r\naside from the presence and absence of transported rocks and other\r\n_débris_, but in nothing is it greater than in the extent of river\r\nerosion which is apparent upon the surface. For example, upon the\r\nwestern flanks of the Alleghanies the regions south of the glacial limit\r\nis everywhere deeply channeled by streams. Indeed, so long have they\r\nevidently been permitted to work in their present channels that, wherever\r\nthere have been waterfalls, they have receded to the very head-waters,\r\nand no cataracts exist in them at the present time. Nor are there in the\r\nunglaciated region any lakes of importance, such as characterize the\r\nglaciated region. If there have been lakes, the lapse of time has been\r\nsufficient for their outlets to lower their beds sufficiently to drain\r\nthe basins dry.\r\n\r\nOn entering the glaciated area all this is changed. The ice-movement\r\nhas everywhere done much to wear down the hills and fill the valleys,\r\nand, where there was _débris_ enough at command, it has obliterated the\r\nnarrow gorges originally occupied by the preglacial streams. Thus it has\r\ncompletely changed the minor lines of superficial drainage, and in many\r\ninstances has produced most extensive and radical changes in the whole\r\ndrainage system of the region. In the glaciated area, channels buried\r\nbeneath glaciated _débris_ are of frequent occurrence, while many of the\r\nstreams which occupy their preglacial channels are flowing at a very much\r\nhigher level than formerly, the lower part of the channel having been\r\nsilted up by the superabundant _débris_ accessible since the glacial\r\nmovement began.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Buried Outlets and Channels._\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how the great number of shallow lakes which frequent\r\nthe glaciated region were formed by the irregular deposition of glacial\r\n_débris_, but it is somewhat more difficult to trace out the connection\r\nbetween the Glacial period and the Great Lakes of North America, several\r\nof which are of such depth that their bottoms are some hundreds of feet\r\nbelow the sea-level, Lake Erie furnishing the only exception. This\r\nlake is so shallow that it is easy to see how its basin may have been\r\nprincipally formed by river erosion, while it is evident that such\r\nmust have been the mode of its formation, since it is surrounded by\r\nsedimentary strata lying nearly in a horizontal position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Section across the valley of the Cuyahoga River,\r\ntwenty miles above its mouth (Claypole).]\r\n\r\nThat Lake Erie is really nothing but a \"glacial mill-pond\" is proved\r\nalso by much direct evidence, especially that derived from the depth of\r\nthe buried channels of the streams flowing into it from the south. Of\r\nthese, the Cuyahoga River, which enters the lake at Cleveland, has been\r\nmost fully investigated. In searching for oil, some years ago, borings\r\nwere made at many places for twenty-five miles above the mouth of the\r\nriver. As a result, it appeared that for the whole distance the rocky\r\nbottom of the gorge was about two hundred feet below the present bottom\r\nof the river, while the river itself is two or three hundred feet below\r\nthe general level of the country, occupying a trough about half a mile in\r\nwidth, with steep, rocky sides. These facts indicate that at one time the\r\nriver must have found opportunity to discharge its contents at a level\r\ntwo hundred feet below that of the present lake, while an examination\r\nof the material filling up the bottom of the gorge to its present level\r\nshows it to be glacial _débris_, thus proving that the silting up was\r\naccomplished during the Glacial period.\r\n\r\nAs the water of Lake Erie is for the most part less than one hundred\r\nfeet in depth, and is nowhere much more than two hundred feet deep, it\r\nis clear that the preglacial outlet which drained it down to the level\r\nof the rocky bottom of the Cuyahoga River must have destroyed the lake\r\naltogether. Hence Ave may be certain that, before the Glacial period, the\r\narea now covered by the lake was simply a broad, shallow valley through\r\nwhich there coursed a single river of great magnitude, with tributary\r\nbranches occupying deep gorges. Professor J. W. Spencer has shown with\r\ngreat probability that the old line of drainage from Lake Erie passed\r\nthrough the lower part of the valley of Grand River, in Canada, and\r\nentered Lake Ontario at its western extremity, and that during the great\r\nIce age this became so completely obstructed with glacial _débris_ as to\r\nform an impenetrable dam, and to cause the pent-up water to flow through\r\nthe Niagara Valley, which chanced to furnish the lowest opening.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the present area of Lake Erie, however, as being then\r\noccupied by a river valley, we do not mean to imply that it was not\r\nafterwards greatly modified by glacial erosion; for undoubtedly this was\r\nthe case, whatever views we may have as to the relative efficiency of ice\r\nand water in scooping out lake basins.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Lake Erie, we need suppose no change of level to account\r\nfor the erosion of its basin, but only that, since the strata in which it\r\nis situated were deposited, time enough had elapsed for a great river to\r\ncut a gorge extending from the western end of Lake Ontario through to the\r\npresent bed of Lake Erie, and that here a great enlargement of the valley\r\nwas occasioned by the existence of deep beds of soft shale which could\r\neasily be worn away by a ramifying system of tributary streams. Rivers\r\nacting at present relative levels would be amply sufficient to produce\r\nthe results which are here manifest.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of Lakes Ontario, Huron, Michigan, and Superior, whose\r\ndepths descend considerably below the sea-level, we must suppose that\r\nthey were, in the main, eroded when the continent was so much elevated\r\nthat their bottoms were brought above tide-level. The depth of Lake\r\nOntario implies the existence of an outlet more than four hundred feet\r\nlower than at present, which, of course, could exist only when the\r\ngeneral elevation was more than four hundred feet greater than now.\r\n\r\nThe existence of an outlet at that depth seems to be proved also by the\r\nfact that at Syracuse, where numerous wells have been sunk to obtain\r\nbrine for the manufacture of salt, deposits of sand, gravel, and rolled\r\nstones, four hundred and fifty feet thick, are penetrated without\r\nreaching rock. Since this lies in the basin of Lake Ontario, it follows\r\nthat if the basin itself has been produced by river erosion, the land\r\nmust have been of sufficient height to permit an outlet through a valley,\r\nor cañon, of the required depth, and this outlet must now be buried\r\nbeneath the abundant glacial _débris_ that covers the region.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newberry, who has studied the vicinity carefully, is of the\r\nopinion that there is ample opportunity for such a line of drainage\r\nto have extended through the Mohawk Valley to the Hudson River. But,\r\nat Little Falls, a spur of the Adirondack Mountains projects into the\r\nvalley, and the Archæan rocks over which the river runs are so prominent\r\nand continuous that some have thought it impossible for the requisite\r\nchannel to have ever existed there. Extensive deposits of glacial\r\n_débris_, however, are found in the vicinity, especially in places some\r\ndistance to the north, and in Professor Newberry's opinion the existence\r\nof a buried channel around the obstruction upon the north side is by no\r\nmeans improbable.\r\n\r\nThe preglacial drainage of Lake Huron has not been determined with any\r\ngreat degree of probability. Professor Spencer formerly supposed that it\r\npassed from the southern end of the lake through London, in the western\r\npart of Ontario, and reached the Erie basin near Port Stanley, and so\r\naugmented the volume of the ancient river which eroded the buried cañon\r\nfrom Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. But he now supposes, though the evidence\r\nis by no means demonstrative, that the waters of Lake Huron passed into\r\nLake Ontario by means of a channel extending from Georgian Bay to the\r\nvicinity of Toronto.\r\n\r\nWith a fair degree of probability, the basin of Lake Superior is\r\nsupposed by Professor Newberry to have been joined to that of Lake\r\nMichigan by some passage, now buried, considerably to the west of the\r\nStrait of Mackinac, and thence to have had an outlet southward from the\r\nvicinity of Chicago directly into the Mississippi River. Of this there\r\nis considerable evidence furnished by deeply buried channels which have\r\nbeen penetrated by borings in various places in Kankakee, Livingston,\r\nand McLean Counties, Illinois; but the whole area extending from Lake\r\nMichigan to the Mississippi is so deeply covered with glacial _débris_\r\nthat the surface of the country gives no satisfactory indication of the\r\nexact lines of preglacial drainage.\r\n\r\nSome of the most remarkable instances of ancient river channels buried\r\nby the glacial deposits have been brought to light in southwestern Ohio,\r\nwhere there has been great activity in boring for gas and oil. At St.\r\nParis, Champaign County, for example, in a locality where the surface\r\nof the rock near by was known to be not far below the general level, a\r\nboring was begun and continued to a depth of more than five hundred feet\r\nwithout reaching rock, or passing out of glacial _débris_.\r\n\r\nMany years ago Professor Newberry collected sufficient facts to show that\r\npretty generally the ancient bed of the Ohio River was as much as 150\r\nfeet below that over which it now flows. During a continental elevation\r\nthe erosion had proceeded to that extent, and then the channel had been\r\nsilted up during the Glacial period with the abundant material carried\r\ndown by the streams from the glaciated area. One of the evidences of\r\nthe preglacial depth of the channel of the Ohio was brought to light at\r\nCincinnati, where \"gravel and sand have been found to extend to a depth\r\nof over one hundred feet below low-water mark, and the bottom of the\r\ntrough has not been reached.\" In the valley of Mill Creek, also, \"in the\r\nsuburbs of Cincinnati, gravel and sand were penetrated to the depth of\r\n120 feet below the stream before reaching rock.\" But from the general\r\nappearance of the channel, Professor J. F. James was led to surmise\r\nthat a rock bottom extended all the way across the present channel of\r\nthe Ohio, between Price Hill and Ludlow, Ky., a short distance below\r\nCincinnati, which would preclude the possibility of a preglacial outlet\r\nat the depth disclosed in that direction. Mr. Charles J. Bates (who was\r\ninspector of the masonry for the Cincinnati Southern Railroad while\r\nbuilding the bridge across the Ohio at this point) informs me that Mr.\r\nJames's surmise is certainly correct, and that his \"in all probability\"\r\nmay be displaced by \"certainly,\" since the bedded rocks supposed by\r\nProfessor James to extend across the river a few feet below its present\r\nbottom were found by the engineers to be in actual existence.\r\n\r\nIn looking for an outlet for the waters of the upper Ohio which should\r\npermit them to flow off at the low level reached in the channel at\r\nCincinnati, Professor James was led to inspect the valley extending\r\nup Mill Creek to the north towards Hamilton, where it joins the Great\r\nMiami. The importance of Mill Creek Valley is readily seen in the fact\r\nthat the canal and the railroads have been able to avoid heavy grades\r\nby following it from Cincinnati to Hamilton. As a glance at a map will\r\nshow, it is also practically but a continuation of the northerly course\r\npursued by the Ohio for twenty miles before reaching Cincinnati. This,\r\ntherefore, was a natural place in which to look beneath the extensive\r\nglacial _débris_ for the buried channel of the ancient Ohio, and here\r\nin all probability it has been found. The borings which have been made\r\nin Milk Creek Valley north of Cincinnati, show that the bedded rock\r\nlies certainly thirty-four feet below the low-water mark of the Ohio\r\njust below Cincinnati, while at Hamilton, twenty-five miles north of\r\nCincinnati, where the valley of the Great Miami is reached, the bedded\r\nrock of the valley lies as much as ninety feet below present low-water\r\nmark in the Ohio.\r\n\r\nOther indications of the greater depth of the preglacial gorge of the\r\nOhio are abundant. \"At the junction of the Anderson with the Ohio, in\r\nIndiana, a well was sunk ninety-four feet below the level of the Ohio\r\nbefore rock was found.\" At Louisville, Ky., the occurrence of falls\r\nin the Ohio seemed at first to discredit the theory in question, but\r\nProfessor Newberry was able to show that the falls at Louisville are\r\nproduced by the water's being now compelled to flow over a rocky point\r\nprojecting from the north side into the old valley, while to the south\r\nthere is ample opportunity for an old channel to have passed around this\r\npoint underneath the city on the south side. The lowlands upon which the\r\ncity stands are made lands, where glacial _débris_ has filled up the old\r\nchannel of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nAbove Cincinnati the tributaries of the Ohio exhibit the same phenomena.\r\nAt New Philadelphia, Tuscarawas County, the borings for salt-wells show\r\nthat the Tuscarawas is running 175 feet above its ancient bed. The\r\nBeaver, at the junction of the Mahoning and Shenango, is flowing 150 feet\r\nabove the bottom of its old trough, as is demonstrated by a large number\r\nof oil-wells bored in the vicinity. Oil Creek is shown by the same proofs\r\nto run from 75 to 100 feet above its old channel, and that channel had\r\nsometimes vertical and even overhanging walls.[CC]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CC: Geological Survey of Ohio, vol. ii, pp. 13, 14.]\r\n\r\nThe course of preglacial drainage in the upper basin of the Alleghany\r\nRiver is worthy of more particular mention. Mr. Carll, of the\r\nPennsylvania Geological Survey, has adduced plausible reasons for\r\nbelieving that previous to the Glacial period the drainage of the\r\nvalley of the upper Alleghany north of the neighbourhood of Tidioute,\r\nin Warren County, instead of passing southward as now, was collected\r\ninto one great stream flowing northward through the region of Cassadaga\r\nLake to enter the Lake Erie basin at Dunkirk, N. Y. The evidence is\r\nthat between Tidioute and Warren the present Alleghany is shallow, and\r\nflows over a rocky basin; but from Warren northward along the valley\r\nof the Conewango, the bottom of the old trough lies at a considerably\r\nlower level, and slopes to the north. Borings show that in thirteen\r\nmiles the slope of the preglacial floor of Conewango Creek to the north\r\nis 136 feet. The actual height above tide of the old valley floor at\r\nFentonville, where the Conewango crosses the New York line, is only 964\r\nfeet; while that of the ancient rocky floor of the Alleghany at Great\r\nBend, a few miles south of Warren, was 1,170 feet. Again, going nearer\r\nthe head-waters of the Alleghany, in the neighbourhood of Salamanca,\r\nit is found that the ancient floor of the Alleghany is, at Carrollton,\r\n70 feet lower than the ancient bed of the present stream at Great\r\nBend, about sixty miles to the south; while at Cole's Spring, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Steamburg, Cattaraugus County, N. Y., there has been\r\nan accumulation of 315 feet of drift in a preglacial valley whose rocky\r\nfloor is 155 feet below the ancient rocky floor at Great Bend. Unless\r\nthere has been a great change in levels, there must, therefore, have\r\nbeen some other outlet than the present for the waters collecting in the\r\ndrainage basin to the north of Great Bend.[CD]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CD: For a criticism of Mr. Carll's views, see an article\r\non Pleistocene Fluvial Planes of Western Pennsylvania, by Mr. Frank\r\nLeverett, in American Journal of Science, vol. xlii, pp. 200-212.]\r\n\r\nWhile there are numerous superficial indications of buried channels\r\nrunning towards Lake Erie in this region, direct exploration has not\r\nbeen made to confirm these theoretical conclusions. In the opinion of Mr.\r\nCarll, Chautauqua Lake did not flow directly to the north, but, passing\r\nthrough a channel nearly coincident with that now occupied by it, joined\r\nthe northerly flowing stream a few miles northeast from Jamestown.[CE] It\r\nis probable, however, that Chautauqua did not then exist as a lake, since\r\nthe length of preglacial time would have permitted its outlet to wear a\r\ncontinuous channel of great depth corresponding to that known to have\r\nexisted in the Conewango and upper Alleghany.\r\n\r\n[Footnote CE: Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania, vol. iii.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are but a few of the innumerable instances where the local\r\nlines of drainage have been disturbed, and even permanently changed,\r\nby the glacial deposits. Almost every lake in the glaciated region is\r\na witness to this disturbance of the established lines of drainage by\r\nglacial action, while in numerous places where lakes do not now exist\r\nthey have been so recently drained that their shore-lines are readily\r\ndiscernible.\r\n\r\nAn interesting instance of the recent disappearance of one of these\r\nglacial lakes is that of Runaway Pond, in northern Vermont. In the early\r\npart of the century the Lamoille River had its source in a small lake\r\nin Craftsbury, Orleans County. The sources of the Missisquoi River were\r\nupon the same level just to the north, and the owner of a mill privilege\r\nupon this latter stream, desiring to increase his power by obtaining\r\naccess to the water of the lake, began digging a ditch to turn it into\r\nthe Missisquoi, but no sooner had he loosened the thin rim of compact\r\nmaterial which formed the bottom and the sides of the inclosure, than the\r\nwater began to rush out through the underlying and adjacent quicksands.\r\nThis almost instantly enlarged the channel, and drained the whole body of\r\nwater oft 3 in an incredibly short time. As a consequence, the torrent\r\nwent rushing down through the narrow valley, sweeping everything before\r\nit; and nothing but the unsettled condition of the country prevented a\r\ndisaster like that which occurred in 1889 at Johnstown, Pa. Doubtless\r\nthere are many other lakes held in position by equally slender natural\r\nembankments. Artificial reservoirs are by no means the only sources of\r\nsuch danger.\r\n\r\nThe buried channel of the old Mississippi River in the vicinity of\r\nMinneapolis is another instructive example of the instability of many\r\nof the present lines of drainage. The gorge of the Mississippi River\r\nextending from Fort Snelling to the Falls of St. Anthony at Minneapolis\r\nis of post-glacial origin. One evidence of this is its narrowness when\r\ncontrasted with the breadth of the valley below Fort Snelling. Below\r\nthis point the main trough of the Mississippi has a width of from two to\r\neight miles, and the faces of the bluffs on either side show the marks\r\nof extreme age. The tributary streams also have had time to wear gorges\r\nproportionate to that of the main stream, and the agencies which oxidise\r\nand discolor the rocks have had time to produce their full effects. But\r\nfrom Fort Snelling up to Minneapolis, a distance of about seven miles,\r\nthe gorge is scarcely a quarter of a mile in width, and the faces of\r\nthe high, steep bluffs on either side are remarkably fresh looking by\r\ncomparison with those below; while the tributary gorges, of which that of\r\nthe Minnehaha River is a fair specimen, are very limited in their extent.\r\n\r\nUpon looking for the cause of this condition of things we observe that\r\nthe broad trough of the Mississippi River, which had characterised it all\r\nthe way below Fort Snelling, continues westward, without interruption, up\r\nthe valley of the present Minnesota River, and, what seems at first most\r\nsingular, it does not cease at the sources of the Minnesota, but, through\r\nLake Traverse and Big Stone Lake, is continuous with the trough of the\r\nRed River of the North.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Map of Mississippi River from Fort Snelling to\r\nMinneapolis and the vicinity, showing the extent of the recession of the\r\nFalls of St. Anthony since the great Ice age. Notice the greater breadth\r\nof the valley of the Minnesota River as described in the text (Winchell).]\r\n\r\nDeferring, however, for a little the explanation of this, we will go\r\nback to finish the history of the preglacial channel around the Falls\r\nof St. Anthony. As early as the year 1876 Professor N. H. Winchell had\r\ncollected sufficient evidence from wells, one of which had been sunk to a\r\ndepth of one hundred and seventy-five feet, to show that the preglacial\r\ncourse of the stream corresponding to the present Mississippi River ran\r\nto the west of Minneapolis and of the Falls of Minnehaha, and joined\r\nthe main valley some distance above Fort Snelling, as shown in the\r\naccompanying map.\r\n\r\nThis condition of things was at one time very painfully brought to the\r\nnotice of the citizens of Minneapolis. A large part of the wealth of the\r\ncity at that time consisted of the commercial value of the water-power\r\nfurnished by the Falls of St. Anthony. To facilitate the discharge of\r\nthe waste water from their wheels, some mill-owners dug a tunnel through\r\nthe soft sandstone underlying the limestone strata over which the river\r\nfalls; but it very soon became apparent that the erosion was proceeding\r\nwith such rapidity that in a few years the recession of the falls would\r\nbe carried back to the preglacial channel, when the river would soon\r\nscour out the channel and destroy their present source of wealth. The\r\ncitizens rallied to protect their property, and spent altogether as\r\nmuch as half a million dollars in filling up the holes that had been\r\nthoughtlessly made; but so serious was the task that they were finally\r\ncompelled to appeal for aid to the United States Government. Permanent\r\nprotection was provided by running a tunnel, some ways back from the\r\nfalls, completely across the channel, through the soft sandstone\r\nunderlying the limestone, and filling this up with cement hard enough\r\nand compact enough to prevent the further percolation of the water from\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ice-Dams._\r\n\r\nThe foregoing changes in lines of drainage due to the Glacial period were\r\nproduced by deposits of earthy material in preglacial channels. Another\r\nclass of temporary but equally interesting changes were produced by the\r\nice itself acting directly as a barrier.\r\n\r\nMany such lakes on a small scale are still in existence in various parts\r\nof the world. The Merjelen See in Switzerland is a well-known instance.\r\nThis is a small body of water held back by the great Aletsch Glacier,\r\nin a little valley leading to that of the Fiesch Glacier, behind the\r\nEggischorn. At irregular intervals the ice-barrier gives way, and allows\r\nthe water to rush out in a torrent and flood the valley below. Afterwards\r\nthe ice closes up again, and the water reaccumulates in preparation for\r\nanother flood.\r\n\r\nOther instances in the Alps are found in the Mattmark See, which fills\r\nthe portion of the Saas Valley between Monte Rosa and the Rhône. This\r\nbody of water is held in place by the Allalin Glacier, which here crosses\r\nthe main valley. The Lac du Combal is held back by the Glacier de Miage\r\nat the southern base of Mont Blanc. \"A more famous case is that of the\r\nGietroz Glacier in the valley of Bagnes, south of Martigny. In 1818\r\nthis lake had grown to be a mile long, and was 700 feet wide and 200\r\nfeet deep. An attempt was made to drain it by cutting through the ice,\r\nand about half the water was slowly drawn off in this way; but then the\r\nbarrier broke, and the rest of the lake was emptied in half an hour,\r\ncausing a dreadful flood in the valley below. In the Tyrol, the Vernagt\r\nGlacier has many times caused disastrous floods by its inability to hold\r\nup the lake formed behind it. In the northwestern Himalaya, the upper\r\nbranches of the Indus are sometimes held back in this way. A noted flood\r\noccurred in 1835; it advanced twenty-five miles in an hour, and was felt\r\nthree hundred miles down-stream, destroying all the villages on the lower\r\nplain, and strewing the fields with stones, sand, and mud.\"[CF]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CF: Professor William M. Davis in. Proceedings of the Boston\r\nSociety of Natural History, vol. xxi, pp. 350, 351.]\r\n\r\nIn Greenland such temporary obstructions are frequent, forming lakes of\r\nconsiderable size. Instances occur, in connection with the Jakobshavn and\r\nthe Frederickshaab Glaciers, and in the North Isortok and Alangordlia\r\nFiords.\r\n\r\nFrequently, also, bodies of water of considerable size are found in\r\ndepressions of the ice itself, even at high levels. I have myself seen\r\nthem covering more than an acre, and as much as a thousand feet above\r\nthe sea-level, upon the surface of the Muir Glacier, Alaska. They are\r\nreported by Mr. I. C. Russell[CG] of larger size and at still higher\r\nelevations upon the glaciers radiating from Mount St. Elias; while the\r\nexplorers of Greenland mention them of impressive size upon the surface\r\nof its continental ice-sheet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote CG: See National Geographic Magazine, vol. iii, pp. 116-120.]\r\n\r\nWith these facts in mind we can the more readily enter into the\r\ndescription which will now be given of some temporary lakes of vast size\r\nwhich were formed by direct ice-obstructions during portions of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of these is illustrated upon the accompanying\r\nmap, which will need little description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Map showing the effect of the glacial dam at\r\nCincinnati (Claypole). (From Transactions of the Edinburgh Geological\r\nSociety.)]\r\n\r\nWhile tracing the boundary-line of the glaciated area in the Mississippi\r\nValley during the summer of 1882, I discovered the existence of\r\nunmistakable glacial deposits in Boone County, Kentucky, across the Ohio\r\nRiver, from Cincinnati.[CH]; These deposits were upon the height of land\r\n550 feet above the Ohio River, or nearly 1,000 feet above the sea, which\r\nis about the height of the water-shed between the Licking and Kentucky\r\nRivers. As the Ohio River occupies a trough of erosion some hundreds of\r\nfeet in depth, and extending all the way from this point to the mountains\r\nof western Pennsylvania, it would follow that the ice which conveyed\r\nboulders across the Ohio River at Cincinnati, and deposited them upon\r\nthe highlands between the Licking and Kentucky Rivers, would so obstruct\r\nthe channel of the Ohio as to pond the water back, and hold it up to\r\nthe level of the lowest pass into the Ohio River farther down. Direct\r\nevidences of obstruction by glacial ice appear also for a distance of\r\nfifty or sixty miles, extending both ways, from Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n[Footnote CH: The existence of portions of this evidence had previously\r\nbeen pointed out by Mr. Robert B. Warder and Dr. George Sutton (see\r\nGeological Reports of Indiana, 1872 and 1878).]\r\n\r\nThe consequences connected with this state of things are of the most\r\ninteresting character.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the Ohio River at Cincinnati is 432 feet above the\r\nsea-level. A dam of 550 feet would raise the water in its rear to a\r\nheight of 982 feet above tide. This would produce a long, narrow lake,\r\nof the width of the eroded trough of the Ohio, submerging the site\r\nof Pittsburg to a depth of 281 feet, and creating slack water up the\r\nMonongahela nearly to Grafton, West Virginia, and up the Alleghany as far\r\nas Oil City. All the tributaries of the Ohio would likewise be filled\r\nto this level. The length of this slack-water lake in the main valley,\r\nto its termination up either the Alleghany or the Monongahela, was not\r\nfar from one thousand miles. The conditions were also peculiar in this,\r\nthat all the northern tributaries rose within the southern margin of the\r\nice-front, which lay at varying distances to the north. Down these there\r\nmust have poured during the summer months immense torrents of water to\r\nstrand boulder-laden icebergs on the summits of such high hills as were\r\nlower than the level of the dam.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, this hypothesis of a glacial dam at Cincinnati aroused\r\nconsiderable discussion, and led to some differences of opinion.\r\nProfessors I. C. White and J. P. Lesley, whose field work has made them\r\nperfectly familiar with the upper Ohio and its tributaries, at once\r\nsupported the theory, with a great number of facts concerning certain\r\nhigh-level terraces along the Alleghany and Monongahela Rivers; while\r\nadditional facts of the same character have been brought to light by\r\nmyself and others. In general, it may be said that in numerous places\r\nterraces occur at a height so closely corresponding to that of the\r\nsupposed dam at Cincinnati, that they certainly strongly suggest direct\r\ndependence upon it. The upward limit of these terraces in the Monongahela\r\nRiver is 1,065 feet, and they are found in various places in situations\r\nwhich indicate that they were formed in still water of such long standing\r\nas would require an obstruction below of considerable permanence.\r\n\r\nOne of the most decisive cases adduced by Professor White occurs near\r\nMorgantown, in West Virginia, of which he gives the following description:\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the considerable elevation--275 feet--of the fifth terrace\r\nabove the present river-bed in the vicinity of Morgantown, its deposits\r\nare frequently found far inland from the Monongahela, on tributary\r\nstreams. A very extensive deposit of this kind occurs on a tributary one\r\nmile and a half northeast of Morgantown; and the region, which includes\r\nthree or four square miles, is significantly known as the 'Flats.' The\r\nelevation of the 'Flats' is 275 feet above the river, or 1,065 feet above\r\ntide. The deposits on this area consist almost entirely of clays and\r\nfine, sandy material, there being very few boulders intermingled. The\r\ndepth of the deposit is unknown, since a well sunk on the land of Mr.\r\nBaker passed through alternate beds of clay, fine sand, and muddy trash,\r\nto a depth of sixty-five feet without reaching bed-rock. In some portions\r\nof the clays which make up this deposit, the leaves of our common\r\nforest-trees are found most beautifully preserved.\r\n\r\n\"At Clarksburg, where the river unites with Elk Creek, there is a wide\r\nstretch of terrace deposits, and the upper limit is there about 1,050\r\nfeet above tide, or only 130 feet above low-water (920 feet); while at\r\nWeston, forty miles above (by the river), these deposits cease at seventy\r\nfeet above low water, which is there 985 feet above tide. It will thus\r\nbe observed that the upper limit of the deposits retains a practical\r\nhorizontality from Morgantown to Weston, a distance of one hundred miles,\r\nsince the upper limit has the same elevation above tide (1,045 to 1,065\r\nfeet) at every locality.\r\n\r\n\"These deposits consist of rounded boulders of sandstone, with a large\r\namount of clay, quicksand, and other detrital matter. The country rock\r\nin this region consists of the soft shales and limestones of the upper\r\ncoal-measures, and hence there are many 'low gaps' from the head of one\r\nlittle stream to that of another, especially along the immediate region\r\nof the river; and in every case the summits of these divides, where they\r\ndo not exceed an elevation of 1,050 feet above tide, are covered with\r\ntransported or terrace material; but where the summits go more than a\r\nfew feet above that level we find no transported material upon them, but\r\nsimply the decomposed country rock.\"\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy terraces naturally attributable to the Cincinnati\r\nice-dam are to be found in the valley of the Kanawha, in West Virginia,\r\nand one of special significance on the pass between the valleys of the\r\nOhio and Monongahela, west of Clarksburg, West Virginia. According to\r\nProfessor White, there is at this latter place \"a broad, level summit,\r\nhaving an elevation of 1,100 feet, in a gap about 300 feet below the\r\nenclosing hills. This gap, or valley, is covered by a deposit of fine\r\nclay. The cut through it is about thirty feet, and one can observe the\r\nsuccession of clays of all kinds and of different colours, from yellow on\r\nthe surface down to the finest white potter's clay at the level of the\r\nrailway, where the cut reaches bed-rock, thus proving that the region has\r\nbeen submerged.\"[CI]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CI: Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, vol. i, p.\r\n478.]\r\n\r\nAnother crucial case I have myself described at Bellevue, in the angle\r\nof the Ohio and Alleghany Rivers, about five miles below Pittsburg,\r\nwhere the gravel terrace is nearly 300 feet above the river, making it\r\nabout 1,000 feet above the sea. A significant circumstance connected\r\nwith this terrace is that not only does its height correspond with that\r\nof the supposed obstruction at Cincinnati, but it contains many pebbles\r\nof Canadian origin, which could not have got into the valley of the\r\nAlleghany before the Glacial period, and could only have reached their\r\npresent position by being brought down the Alleghany River upon floating\r\nice, or by the ordinary movement of gravel along the margin of a river.\r\nThus this terrace, while corresponding closely with the elevation of\r\nthose on the Monongahela River, is directly connected with the Glacial\r\nperiod, and furnishes a twofold argument for our theory.\r\n\r\nA still stronger case occurs at Beech Flats, at the head of Ohio\r\nBrush Creek, in the northwest corner of Pike County, Ohio, where, at\r\nan elevation of about 950 feet above the sea, there is an extensive\r\nflat-topped terrace just in front of the terminal moraine. This terrace\r\nconsists of fine loam, such as is derived from the glacial streams, but\r\nwhich must have been deposited in still water. The occurrence of still\r\nwater at that elevation just in front of the continental ice-sheet is\r\nbest accounted for by the supposed dam at Cincinnati. Indeed, it is\r\nextremely difficult to account for it in any other way.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two other methods of attempting to account for the\r\nclass of facts above cited in support of the ice-dam theory, of which the\r\nmost plausible is, that in connection with the Glacial period there was\r\na subsidence of the whole region to an extent of 1,100 feet.\r\n\r\nThe principal objection heretofore alleged against this supposition is\r\nthat there are not corresponding signs of still-water action at the same\r\nlevel on the other side of the Alleghany Mountains. This will certainly\r\nbe fatal to the subsidence theory, if it proves true. But it is possible\r\nthat sufficient search for such marks has not yet been made on the\r\neastern side of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe other theory to account for the facts is, that the terraces adduced\r\nin proof of the Cincinnati ice-dam were left by the streams in the slow\r\nprocess of lowering their beds from their former high levels. This is\r\nthe view advocated by President T. C. Chamberlin. But the freshness\r\nof the leaves and fragments of wood, such as were noted by Professor\r\nWhite at Morgantown, and the great extent of fine silt occasionally\r\nresting upon the summits of the water-sheds, as described above, near\r\nClarksburg, bear strongly against it. Furthermore, to account for the\r\nterrace described at Bellevue, which contains Canadian pebbles, President\r\nChamberlin is compelled to connect the deposit with his hypothetical\r\nfirst Glacial epoch, and to assume that all the erosion of the Alleghany\r\nand Monongahela Rivers, and indeed of the whole trough of the Ohio River,\r\ntook place in the interval between the \"first\" and the \"second\" Glacial\r\nperiods (for he would connect the glacial deposits upon the south side of\r\nthe river at Cincinnati with the first Glacial epoch)--all of which, it\r\nwould seem, is an unnecessary demand upon the forces of Nature, when the\r\nfacts are so easily accounted for by the simple supposition of the dam at\r\nCincinnati.[CJ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CJ: See matter discussed more at length in the lee Age, pp.\r\n326-350, 480-500; Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey, No.\r\n58, pp. 76-100; Popular Science Monthly, vol. xlv, pp. 184-199. _Per\r\ncontra_, Mr. Frank Leverett, in American Geologist, vol. x, pp. 18-24.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Map showing the condition of things when the\r\nice-front had withdrawn about on hundred and twenty miles, and while\r\nit still filled the valley of the Mohawk. The outlet was then through\r\nthe Wabash. Niagara was not yet born (Claypole). (Transactions of the\r\nEdinburgh Geological Society.)]\r\n\r\nWe have already described[CK] the various temporary lakes and lines of\r\ndrainage caused by the direct obstruction of the northward outlets to\r\nthe basin of the Great Lakes. In connection with the map, it will be\r\nunnecessary to do anything more here than add a list of such temporary\r\nsouthern outlets from the Erie-Ontario basin.[CL] The first is at Fort\r\nWayne, Indiana, through a valley connecting the Maumee River basin with\r\nthat of the Wabash. The channel here is well defined, and the high-level\r\ngravel terraces down the Wabash River are a marked characteristic of the\r\nvalley. The elevation of this col above the sea is 740 feet. Similar\r\ntemporary lines of drainage existed from the St. Mary's River to the\r\nGreat Miami, at an elevation of 942 feet; from the Sandusky River to\r\nthe Scioto, through the Tymochtee Gap, at an elevation of 912 feet;\r\nfrom Black River to the Killbuck (a tributary of the Muskingum) through\r\nthe Harrisville Gap, at 911 feet; from the Cuyahoga into the Tuscarawas\r\nValley, through the Akron Gap, at 971 feet; from Grand River into the\r\nMahoning, through the Orwell Gap, 938 feet; from Cattaraugus Creek, N.\r\nY., into the Alleghany Valley through the Dayton Gap, about 1,300 feet;\r\nbetween Conneaut Creek and Shenango River, at Summit Station, 1,141 feet;\r\nfrom the Genesee River, N. Y., into the head-waters of the Canisteo, a\r\nbranch of the Susquehanna, at Portageville, 1,314 feet; from Seneca Lake\r\nto Chemung River, at Horseheads, 879 feet; from Cayuga Lake to the valley\r\nof Cayuga Creek, at Spencer, N. Y., 1,000 feet; from Utica, N. Y., into\r\nthe Chenango Valley at Hamilton, about 900 feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote CK: See pp. 92 seq., 199 _seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CL: See also accompanying map.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--Map illustrating a stage in the recession of the\r\nice in Ohio. For a section of the deposit in the bed of this lakelet, see\r\npage 200. The gravel deposits formed at this stage along the outlet into\r\nthe Tuscarawas River are very clearly marked (Claypole). (Transactions of\r\nthe Edinburgh Geological Society.)]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would have been best to give this list in the reverse order,\r\nwhich would be more nearly chronological, since it is clear that the\r\nhighest outlets are the oldest. We should then have to mention, after the\r\nFort Wayne outlet, two others at lower levels which are pretty certainly\r\nmarked by distinct beach ridges upon the south side of Lake Erie. The\r\nfirst was opened when the ice had melted back from the south peninsula of\r\nMichigan to the water-shed across from the Shiawassee and Grand Rivers,\r\nuncovering a pass which is now 729 feet above the sea. This continued to\r\nbe the outlet of Lake Erie-Ontario until the ice had further retreated\r\nbeyond the Strait of Mackinac, when the water would fall to the level of\r\nthe old outlet from Lake Michigan into the Illinois River, which is a\r\nlittle less than 600 feet, where it would remain until the final opening\r\nof the Mohawk River in New York attracted the water in that direction,\r\nand lowered the level to that of the pass from Lake Ontario to the Mohawk\r\nat Rome.[CM]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CM: Mr. Warren Upham, in the Bulletin of the Geological Society\r\nof America, vol. ii, p. 259.]\r\n\r\nA study of these lines of temporary drainage during the Glacial period\r\nsheds much light upon the long lines of gravel ridges running parallel\r\nwith the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. South of Lake Erie a\r\nseries of four ridges of different elevations can be traced. In Lorain\r\nCounty, Ohio, the highest of these is 220 feet above the lake; the next\r\n160 feet; the next 118 feet; and the lower one 100 feet, which would make\r\nthem respectively 795, 755, 715, and 700 feet above tide.\r\n\r\nThese gravel ridges are evidently old beach lines, and indicate the\r\ndifferent levels up to which the water was held by ice-obstructions\r\nacross the various outlets of the drainage valley. The material in the\r\nridges is water-worn and well assorted, and in coarseness ranges from\r\nfine sand up to pebbles several inches in diameter. The predominant\r\nmaterial in them is of local origin. Where the rocks over which they run\r\nare sandstone, the material is chiefly sand, and where the outcropping\r\nrock is shale, the ridges consist chiefly of the harder nodules of that\r\nformation which have successfully resisted the attrition of the waves.\r\nOrdinarily these ridges are steepest upon the side facing the lake.\r\nAccording to Mr. Upham, who has driven over them with me, the Lake Erie\r\nridges correspond, both in general appearance and in all other important\r\nrespects, to those which he has so carefully surveyed around the shores\r\nof the ancient Lake Agassiz in Minnesota and Manitoba, an account of\r\nwhich will be given a little farther on in this chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Section of the lake ridges near Sandusky, Ohio.]\r\n\r\nWe are not permitted, however, to assume that there have been no changes\r\nof level since the deposition of these beaches surrounding the ancient\r\nglacial Lake Erie-Ontario. On the contrary, there appears to have been\r\na considerable elevation towards the east and northeast in post-glacial\r\ntimes. The highest ridge south of Lake Erie, which at Fort Wayne is about\r\n780 feet high, is now about 795 feet in Lorain County. The second of the\r\nridges above-mentioned, which is about 740 feet above tide at Cleveland,\r\nOhio, rises to 870 feet where the last traces of it have been discovered\r\nat Hamburg, N. Y. The third ridge, which is 673 feet at Cleveland, has\r\nrisen to the height of 860 feet at Crittenden, about one hundred miles to\r\nthe east of Buffalo, N. Y.\r\n\r\nA similar eastern increase of elevation is discoverable in the main ridge\r\nsurrounding Lake Ontario. What Professor Spencer calls the Iroquois\r\nbeach, which is 363 feet above tide at Hamilton, Ontario, has risen to a\r\nheight of 484 feet near Syracuse, N. Y.; while farther to the northeast,\r\nin the vicinity of Watertown, it is upwards of 800 feet above tide.\r\n\r\nThere is also a similar northward increase of elevation in the beaches\r\nsurrounding the higher lands of Ontario eastward of Lake Huron and\r\nGeorgian Bay.\r\n\r\nAll this indicates that at the close of the Glacial period there\r\nwas a subsidence of several hundred feet in the area of greatest\r\nice-accumulation lying to the east and north of the Great Lake region.\r\nThe formation of these ridges occurred during that period of subsidence.\r\nThe re-elevation which followed the disappearance of the ice of course\r\ncarried with it these ridges, and brought them to their present\r\nposition.[CN]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CN: See Spencer, in Bulletin of the Geological Society of\r\nAmerica, vol. ii, pp. 465-476.]\r\n\r\nIn returning to consider more particularly the remarkable gorge joining\r\nthe Minnesota with the Red River of the North, we are brought to the\r\nlargest of the glacial lakes of this class, and to the typical place in\r\nAmerica in which to study the temporary changes of drainage produced by\r\nthe ice itself daring the periods both of its advance and of its retreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Map showing the stages of recession of the ice\r\nin Minnesota as described in the text (Upham).]\r\n\r\nBy turning to our general map of the glaciated region of the United\r\nStates,[CO] one can readily see the relation of the valley between\r\nLake Traverse and Big Stone Lake to an area marked as the bed of what\r\nis called Lake Agassiz. During the Glacial period Brown's Valley, the\r\ndepression joining these two lakes, was the outlet of an immense body of\r\nwater to the north, whose natural drainage was towards Hudson Bay or the\r\nArctic Ocean, but which was cut off, by the advancing ice, from access to\r\nthe ocean-level in that direction, and was compelled to seek an exit to\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\n[Footnote CO: See page 66.]\r\n\r\nThus for a long period the present Minnesota River Valley was occupied\r\nby a stream of enormous dimensions, and this accounts for the great\r\nsize of the trough--the present Minnesota being but an insignificant\r\nstream winding about in this deserted channel of the old \"Father of\r\nWaters,\" and having as much room as a child of tender age would have in\r\nhis parent's cast-off garments. This glacial stream has been fittingly\r\nnamed River Warren, after General Warren, who first suggested and proved\r\nits existence, and so we have designated it on the accompanying map of\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nLake Traverse is fifteen miles long, and the water is nowhere more than\r\ntwenty feet deep. Big Stone Lake is twenty-six miles long, and of about\r\nthe same depth. Brown's Valley, which connects the two, is five miles\r\nlong, and the lakes are so nearly on a level that during floods the water\r\nfrom Lake Traverse sometimes overflows and runs to the south as well as\r\nto the north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Glacial terrace near the boundary of the\r\nglaciated area, on Raccoon Creek, a tributary of the Licking River, in\r\nGranville, Licking County, Ohio. Height about fifty feet.]\r\n\r\nThe trough occupied by these lakes and valley is from one mile to one\r\nmile and a half in width and about 120 feet in depth. If we had been\r\npermitted to stand upon the bluffs overlooking it during the latter\r\npart of the Glacial period, we should have seen the whole drainage of\r\nthe north passing by our feet on its way to the Gulf of Mexico. As lie\r\nfollows down the valley of the Minnesota River, the observant traveller,\r\neven now, cannot fail to see in the numerous well-preserved gravel\r\nterraces the high-water marks of that stream when flooded with the joint\r\nproduct of the annual precipitation over the vast area to the north, and\r\nof the still more enormous quantities set free by the melting of the\r\nwestern part of the great Laurentide Glacier.\r\n\r\nNumerous other deserted water-ways in the northwestern part of the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi have been brought to light in the more\r\nrecent geological surveys, both in the United States and in Canada.\r\nDuring a considerable portion of the Glacial period the Saskatchewan,\r\nthe Assiniboine, the Pembina, and the Cheyenne Rivers, whose present\r\ndrainage is into the Red River of the North, were all turned to the\r\nsouth, and their temporary channels can be distinctly traced by deserted\r\nwater-courses marked by lines of gravel deposits.[CP]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CP: For further particulars, see Ice Age, pp. 293 _et seq._]\r\n\r\nIn Dakota, Professor J. E. Todd has discovered large deserted channels\r\non the southwestern border of the glaciated region near the Missouri\r\nRiver, where evidently streams must have flowed for a long distance in\r\nice-channels when the ice still continued to occupy the valley of the\r\nJames River. From these channels of ice in which the water was held up\r\nto the level of the Missouri Coteau the water debouched directly into\r\nchannels with sides and bottom of earthy material, which still show every\r\nmark of their former occupation by great streams.[CQ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CQ: For particulars, see Ice Age, p. 292.]\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota, also, there is abundant evidence that while the\r\nnortheastern part of the valley from Mankato to St. Paul was occupied by\r\nice, the drainage was temporarily turned directly southward across the\r\ncountry through Union Slough and Blue Earth River into the head-waters of\r\nthe Des Moines River in Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ancient River Terraces._\r\n\r\nThe interest of the whole inquiry respecting the relation of man to\r\nthe Glacial period in America concentrates upon these temporary lines\r\nof southern drainage. Wherever they existed, the swollen floods of the\r\nGlacial period have left their permanent marks in the deposition of\r\nextensive gravel terraces. The material thus distributed is derived\r\nlargely from the glacial deposits through which they run and out of which\r\nthey emerge. While the height of the terraces depended upon various\r\nconditions which must be studied in detail, in general it may be said\r\nthat it corresponds pretty closely with the extent of the area whose\r\ndrainage was turned through the channel during the prevalence of the ice.\r\nThe height of the terraces and the coarseness of the material seem also\r\nto have been somewhat dependent upon the proximity of their valleys to\r\nthe areas of most vigorous ice-action, and this, in turn, seems to lie in\r\nthe rear of the moraines which President Chamberlin has attributed to the\r\nsecond Glacial epoch. Southward from this belt of moraines the terraces\r\nuniformly and gradually diminish both in height and in the coarseness of\r\ntheir gravel, until they finally disappear in the present flood-plain of\r\nthe Mississippi River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Ideal section across a river-bed in drift\r\nregion: _b b b_, old river-bed; _R_, the present river; _t t_, upper or\r\nolder terraces; _t' t'_, lower terraces.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting illustration of this principle is to be observed in the\r\ncontinuous valley of the Alleghany and Ohio Rivers. The trough of this\r\nvalley was reached by the continental glacier at only a few points,\r\nthe ice barely touching it at Salamanca, N. Y., Franklin, Pa., and\r\nCincinnati, Ohio. But throughout its whole length the ice-front was\r\napproximately parallel to the valley, and occupied the head-waters of\r\nnearly all its tributaries. Now, wherever tributaries which could be fed\r\nby glacial floods, enter the trough of the main stream, they brought down\r\nan excessive amount of gravel, and greatly increased the size of the\r\nterrace in the trough itself, and from the mouth of each such tributary\r\nto that of the next one below there is a gradual decrease in the height\r\nof the terrace and in the coarseness of the material.\r\n\r\nThis law is illustrated with special clearness in Pennsylvania between\r\nFranklin and Beaver. Franklin is upon the Alleghany River, at the last\r\npoint where it was reached directly by the ice. Below this point no\r\ntributary reaches it from the glaciated region, and none such reaches the\r\nOhio after its junction with the Alleghany until we come to the mouth of\r\nBeaver Creek, about twenty-five miles below Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nBut at this point the Ohio is joined by a line of drainage which emerges\r\nfrom the glaciated area only ten or twelve miles to the north, and whose\r\nbranches occupy an exceptionally large glaciated area. Accordingly, there\r\nis at Beaver a remarkable increase in the size of the glacial terrace\r\non the Ohio. In the angle down-stream between the Beaver and the Ohio\r\nthere is an enormous accumulation of granitic pebbles, many of them\r\nalmost large enough to be called boulders, forming the delta terrace,\r\nupon which the city is built and rising to a height of 135 feet above\r\nthe low-water mark in the Ohio. In striking confirmation of our theory,\r\nalso, the terrace in the Ohio Valley upon the upper side of Beaver Creek\r\nis composed of fine material, largely derived from local rocks and\r\ncontaining but few granitic pebbles.\r\n\r\nFrom the mouth of Beaver Creek, down the Ohio, the terrace is constant\r\n(sometimes upon one side of the river and sometimes upon the other),\r\nbut, according to rule, the material of which it is composed gradually\r\ngrows finer, and the elevation of the terrace decreases. According to\r\nrule, also, there is a notable increase in the height of the terrace\r\nbelow each affluent which enters the river from the glaciated region.\r\nThis is specially noticeable below Marietta, at the mouth of the\r\nMuskingum, whose head-waters drain an extensive portion of the glaciated\r\narea. From the mouth of the Little Beaver to this point the tributaries\r\nof the Ohio are all small, and none of them rise within the glacial\r\nlimit. Hence they could contribute nothing of the granitic material which\r\nenters so largely into the formation of the river terrace; but below the\r\nmouth of the Muskingum the terrace suddenly ascends to a height of nearly\r\none hundred feet above low-water mark.\r\n\r\nAgain, at the mouth of the Scioto at Portsmouth, there is a marked\r\nincrease in the size of the terrace, which is readily accounted for by\r\nthe floods which came down the Scioto Valley from the glaciated region.\r\nThe next marked increase is at Cincinnati, just below the mouth of the\r\nLittle Miami, whose whole course lay in the glaciated region, and whose\r\nmargin is lined by very pronounced terraces. At Cincinnati the upper\r\nterrace upon which the city is built is 120 feet above the flood-plain.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five miles farther down the river, near Lawrenceburg, these\r\nglacial terraces are even more extensive, the valley being there between\r\nthree and four miles wide, and being nearly filled with gravel deposits\r\nto a height of 112 feet above the flood-plain. Below this point the\r\nterraces gradually diminish in height, and the material becomes finer\r\nand more water-worn, until it merges at last in the flood-plain of the\r\nMississippi. The course of the Wabash River is too long to permit it to\r\nadd materially to the size of the terraces which characterise the broader\r\nvalley of the Ohio below the Illinois line.\r\n\r\nIt is in terraces such as these just described that we find the imbedded\r\nrelics of man which definitely connect him with the great Ice age. These\r\nhave now been found in the glacial terraces of the Delaware River at\r\nTrenton, N. J.; in similar terraces in the valley of the Tuscarawas River\r\nat New Comerstown, and in the valley of the Little Miami at Loveland and\r\nMadisonville, in Ohio; on the East Fork of White River, at Medora, Ind.;\r\nand still, again, at Little Falls, in the trough of the Mississippi, some\r\ndistance above Minneapolis, Minn.\r\n\r\nI append a list of the points at which various streams from the Atlantic\r\nOcean to the Mississippi River emerge from the glacial boundary, and\r\nbelow which the terraces are specially prominent. Of course, with the\r\nretreat of the ice, the formation of the terraces continued northward\r\nin the glaciated area to a greater or less distance, according to the\r\nextent of the valley or to the length of time during which the drainage\r\nwas temporarily turned into it. These points of emergence are: In the\r\nDelaware Valley, at Belvidere, N. J.; in the Susquehanna, at Beach Haven,\r\nPa.; in the Conewango, at Ackley, Warren County; in Oil Creek, above\r\nTitusville: in French Creek, a little above Franklin; in Beaver Creek,\r\nat Chewtown, Lawrence County; on the Middle Fork of Little Beaver, near\r\nNew Lisbon, Ohio; on the east branch of Sandy Creek, at East Rochester,\r\nColumbiana County; on the Nimishillin, at Canton, Stark County; on the\r\nTuscarawas, at Bolivar; on Sugar Creek, at Beech City; on the Killbuck,\r\nat Millersburg, Holmes County; on the Mohican, near the northeast corner\r\nof Knox County; on the Licking River, at Newark; on Jonathan Creek, Perry\r\nCounty; on the Hocking, at Lancaster; on the Scioto, at Hopetown, just\r\nabove Chillicothe; on Paint Creek, and its various tributaries, between\r\nChillicothe and Bainbridge; and on the Wabash, above New Harmony, Ind.;\r\nto which may be added the Ohio River itself, at its junction with the\r\nMiami, near Lawrenceburg.\r\n\r\nAnother class of terraces having most interesting connection with the\r\nGlacial period is found in the arid basins west of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nOver wide areas in Utah and Nevada the evaporation now just balances\r\nthe precipitation, and all the streams disappear in shallow bodies of\r\nsalt water of moderate dimensions, of which Great Salt Lake in Utah, and\r\nMono, Pyramid, and North Carson Lakes in Nevada, are the most familiar\r\nexamples. These occupy the lowest sinks of enclosed basins of great depth.\r\n\r\nBut there is abundant evidence that in consequence of the increased\r\nprecipitation and diminished evaporation of the Glacial period one of\r\nthese basins was filled to the brim and the other to a depth of several\r\nhundred feet. These former enlargements have been named after the first\r\nexplorers of the region, Captains Lahontan and Bonneville, and are shown\r\non the accompanying sketch map by the shading surrounding the existing\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\nLake Lahontan has been carefully studied by Mr. I. C. Russell, and has\r\nbeen found to extend from the boundary of Oregon to latitude 38° 30'\r\nsouth, a distance of two hundred and sixty miles. The Central Pacific\r\nRailroad runs through its dried-up bed from Golconda to Wadsworth, a\r\ndistance of one hundred and sixty-five miles. The terraces of the former\r\nlake are distinctly traceable at a height of 700 feet above the present\r\nlevel of Lake Mono.\r\n\r\nLake Bonneville, whose present representative is Great Salt Lake, is the\r\nsubject of a recent monograph by Mr. G. K. Gilbert, from which it appears\r\nthat this ancient body of water occupied 19,750 square miles--an area\r\nabout ten times that of the present lake. At the time of its maximum\r\nextension its depth was 1,000 feet, while Great Salt Lake ranges only\r\nfrom fifteen to fifty feet in depth.\r\n\r\nThe pass through which the discharge finally took place is at Red Rock,\r\non the Utah and Northern Railroad, at the head of Cache Valley on the\r\nsouth and the lower part of Marsh Creek Valley on the north. During\r\nthe long period preceding and accompanying the gradual rise of water in\r\nthe Utah basin to the level of the highest terrace, Marsh Creek (the\r\nupper portion of which comes from the mountains on the east and turns\r\nat right angles) had been at work depositing a delta of loose material\r\nin the col which separates the two valleys. This deposit rested upon\r\na stratum of limestone at the bottom of the pass, and covered it with\r\nsand, clay, and gravel to a depth of 375 feet. Thus, when the water was\r\napproaching its upper level, the only barrier to prevent its escape was\r\nthis unstable accumulation of loose material upon top of the rock. It\r\nwould have required, therefore, no prophet's eye to predict that the way\r\nwas preparing for a tremendous _débâcle_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Map of the Quaternary Lakes. Bonneville and\r\nLahontan (after Gilbert and Russell).]\r\n\r\nThe critical point at length was reached. After remaining nearly at\r\nthe elevation of the pass for a considerable period, during which the\r\n1,000-foot shore-line was formed, the crisis came when the water began\r\nto flow northward towards Snake River. Once begun in such loose material,\r\nthe channel rapidly enlarged until soon a stream equal to Niagara, and\r\nat times probably much larger, was pouring northward through the valley\r\nheretofore occupied by the insignificant rivulets of Marsh Creek and\r\nthe Port Neuf. It is impossible to tell how rapidly the loose barrier\r\nwore away, but there is abundant evidence in the valley below that not\r\nonly the present channel of the lower part of Marsh Creek, but the whole\r\nbottom of the valley for a mile or more in width, was for a considerable\r\ntime covered by a rapid stream from ten to twenty feet in depth, and\r\ndescending at the rate of thirteen feet to the mile.\r\n\r\nThe continuance of this flood was dependent upon the amount of water to\r\nbe discharged, which, as we have seen, was that contained in an area of\r\n20,000 square miles, with a depth of 375 feet. A stream of the size of\r\nNiagara would occupy about twenty-five years in the discharge of such a\r\nmass, and this may fairly be taken as a measure of the time through which\r\nit lasted. When the loose material lying above the strata of limestone\r\nin Red Rock Pass had been washed away, the lake then continued at that\r\nlevel for an indefinite period, with an overflow regulated by the annual\r\nprecipitation of the drainage basin. This stage of the lake, during which\r\nit occupied 13,000 square miles and was 625 feet above its present level,\r\nis also marked by an extensive and persistent shore-line all around\r\nthe basin. But, finally, the balance again turned when the evaporation\r\nexceeded the precipitation, and the vast body of water has since dwindled\r\nto its present insignificant dimensions.\r\n\r\nMy own interest in this discovery of Mr. Gilbert is enhanced by the\r\nexplanation it gives of a phenomenon in the Snake River Valley which I\r\nwas unable to solve when on the ground in 1890. The present railroad\r\ntown of Pocatello is situated just where this flood emerged from the\r\nnarrower valley of Marsh Creek and the Port Neuf, and spread itself out\r\nupon the broad plain of the Snake River basin. The southern edge of the\r\nplain upon which the city is built is a vast boulder-bed covered with a\r\nthin stratum of sand and gravel. Everywhere, in sinking wells and digging\r\nditches on the vacant lots and in the streets of the city, water-worn\r\nboulders of a great variety of material and sometimes three or four feet\r\nin diameter are encountered. I was debarred from regarding this as a\r\nterminal moraine, both by the water-worn character of the boulders and by\r\nthe absence of any sign of ice-action in the surrounding mountains, and I\r\nwas equally debarred from attributing it to any ordinary stream of water,\r\nboth by the size of the boulders and the fact that for a mile or more up\r\nthe Port Neuf Valley there is an intervale, forty or fifty feet below the\r\nsurface at Pocatello, and occupying the whole width of the valley, in\r\nwhich there is only gravel and fine sand, through which the present Port\r\nNeuf pursues a meandering course. The upper end of this short intervale\r\nis bounded by the terminus of a basaltic stream which had flowed down the\r\nvalley and filled it to a considerable depth, but had subsequently been\r\nmuch eroded by violent water-action.\r\n\r\nIn the light of Mr. Gilbert's discoveries, however, everything is clear.\r\nThe tremendous _débâcle_ which he has brought within the range of\r\nscientific vision would naturally produce just the condition of things\r\nwhich is so puzzling at Pocatello. Coming down through the restricted\r\nchannel with sufficient force to roll along boulders of great size and\r\nto clear them all out from the upper portion of the valley, the torrent\r\nwould naturally deposit them where the current was first checked, a mile\r\nbelow the lava cliffs. The plunge of the water over these cliffs would\r\nkeep a short space below clear from boulders, and the more moderate\r\nstream of subsequent times would fill in the depression with the sand\r\nand gravel now occupying it.\r\n\r\nWhat other effects of this remarkable outburst may be traced farther down\r\nin the Snake River Valley I cannot say, but it will be surprising if\r\nthey do not come to light and help to solve some of the many geological\r\nproblems yet awaiting us in this interesting region.\r\n\r\nIt should have been said that during the formation of the 625-foot, or\r\nso-called Provo shore-line, glaciers descended from the cañons on the\r\nwest flank of the Wahsatch Mountains, and left terminal moraines to mark\r\nthe coincidence of the Glacial period with that stage of the enlargement\r\nof the lake. Evidences of a similar coincidence are to be found on the\r\nhigh-level terraces surrounding Lake Mono, to which glaciers formerly\r\ndescended from the western flanks of the Sierra Nevada.\r\n\r\nThe ancient shore-lines surrounding Lakes Bonneville and Lahontan bear\r\nevidence also of various other episodes in the Glacial period. Evidently\r\nthere were two periods of marked increase in the size of the lakes, with\r\nan arid period intervening. During the first rise the level of Bonneville\r\nattained to within ninety feet of the second, and numerous beaches were\r\nformed, and a large amount of yellow clay deposited. Then it seems\r\nto have been wholly evaporated, while its soluble mineral matter was\r\nprecipitated, and so mingled with silt that it did not readily redissolve\r\nduring the second great rise of water. Partly on this account, and partly\r\nthrough the influence of the outlet into the Snake River, the lake was\r\nnearly fresh during its second enlargement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_European Facts._\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VI it came in place to mention many of the facts connected\r\nwith the influence of the Glacial period upon the drainage systems\r\nof Europe. We there discussed briefly the probable influence of the\r\nice-obstructions that extended across the mouths of the Dwina, the\r\nVistula, the Oder, the Elbe, the Weser, and the Rhine. The drainage of\r\nthe obstructed rivers in Russia was perhaps turned southward into the\r\nCaspian and Black Seas, and then assisted in forming the fertile soil of\r\nthe plains in the southern part of that empire.\r\n\r\nThe obstructed drainage of the German rivers was probably turned westward\r\nin front of the ice through the Straits of Dover or across the southern\r\npart of England. This was during the climax of the Glacial period; but\r\nlater, according to Dawkins, during a period in which the land of the\r\nBritish Isles stood about 600 feet above its present level, the streams\r\nof the eastern coast--namely, \"the Thames, Medway, Humber, Tyne, and\r\nothers, joined the Rhine, the Weser, and the Elbe, to form a river\r\nflowing through the valley of the ocean. In like manner, the rivers of\r\nthe south of England and of the north of France formed a great river\r\nflowing past the Channel Islands due west into the Atlantic, and the\r\nSevern united with the rivers of the south of Ireland; while those to the\r\neast of Ireland joined the Dee, Mersey Ribble, and Lune, as well as those\r\nof western Scotland, ultimately reaching the Atlantic to the west of the\r\nHebrides. The water-shed between the valleys of the British Channel and\r\nthe North Sea is represented by a ridge passing due south from Folkestone\r\nto Dieppe, and that between the drainage area and the Severn and its\r\ntributaries on the one hand, and of the Irish Channel on the other, by a\r\nridge from Holyhead westward to Dublin.\r\n\r\n\"This tract of low, undulating land which surrounded Britain and Ireland\r\non every side consisted not merely of rich hill, valley, and plain, but\r\nalso of marsh-land studded with lakes, like the meres of Norfolk, now\r\nindicated by the deeper soundings. These lakes were very numerous to the\r\nsouth of the Isle of Wight and off the coast of Norfolk and Suffolk.\"[CR]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CR: Early Man in Britain, p. 151.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence first regarded by scientific men to be demonstrative of the\r\nformation of extensive lakes during the Glacial period by the direct\r\ninfluence of ice-dams exists in the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Parallel roads of Glen Roy.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the description of Sir Charles Lyell, \"Glen Roy is situated\r\nin the western Highlands, about ten miles north of Fort William, near the\r\nwestern end of the great glen of Scotland, or Caledonian Canal, and near\r\nthe foot of the highest of the Grampians, Ben Nevis. Throughout nearly\r\nits whole length, a distance of more than ten miles, three parallel\r\nroads or shelves are traced along the steep sides of the mountains, each\r\nmaintaining a perfect horizontality, and continuing at exactly the same\r\nlevel on the opposite sides of the glen. Seen at a distance they appear\r\nlike ledges, or roads, cut artificially out of the sides of the hills;\r\nbut when we are upon them, we can scarcely recognize their existence, so\r\nuneven is their surface and so covered with boulders. They are from ten\r\nto sixty feet broad, and merely differ from the side of the mountain by\r\nbeing somewhat less steep.\r\n\r\n\"On closer inspection, we find that these terraces are stratified in\r\nthe ordinary manner of alluvial or littoral deposits, as may be seen at\r\nthose points where ravines have been excavated by torrents. The parallel\r\nshelves, therefore, have not been caused by denudation, but by the\r\ndeposition of detritus, precisely similar to that which is dispersed in\r\nsmaller quantities over the declivities of the hills above. These hills\r\nconsist of clay-slate, mica-schist, and granite, which rocks have been\r\nworn away and laid bare at a few points immediately above the parallel\r\nroads. The lowest of these roads is about 850 feet above the level of the\r\nsea, and the next about 212 feet higher, and the third 82 feet above the\r\nsecond. There is a fourth shelf, which occurs only in a contiguous valley\r\ncalled Glen Gluoy, which is twelve feet above the highest of all the Glen\r\nRoy roads, and consequently about 1,156 feet above the level of the sea.\r\nOne only, the lowest of the three roads of Glen Roy, is continued through\r\nGlen Spean, a large valley with which Glen Roy unites. As the shelves,\r\nhaving no slope towards the sea like ordinary river terraces, are always\r\nat the same absolute height, they become continually more elevated above\r\nthe river in proportion as we descend each valley; and they at length\r\nterminate very abruptly, without any obvious cause, or any change either\r\nin the shape of the ground or in the composition or hardness of the\r\nrocks.\"[CS]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CS: Antiquity of Man, pp. 252, 253.]\r\n\r\nEarly in his career Charles Darwin studied these ancient beaches, and\r\nascribed them to the action of the sea during a period of continental\r\nsubsidence. In this view he was supported by the majority of geologists\r\nuntil the region was visited by Agassiz, who saw at once the true\r\nexplanation. If these were really sea-beaches, similar deposits should\r\nbe found at the same elevation on other mountains than those surrounding\r\nGlen Roy. Their absence elsewhere points, therefore, to some local cause,\r\nwhich was readily suggested to the trained eye of one like Agassiz, then\r\nfresh from the study of Alpine glaciers, who saw that these beaches were\r\nformed upon the margin of temporary lakes, held back during the Glacial\r\nperiod (as the Merjelen See now is) by a glacier which came out of one\r\nglen and projected itself directly across the course of another, and thus\r\nobstructed its drainage. The glacier of Glen Spean had pushed itself\r\nacross Glen Roy, as the great Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland now pushes\r\nitself across the little valley behind the Eggishorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nRELICS OF MAN IN THE GLACIAL PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Glacial Terraces of the United States._\r\n\r\nAlthough the first clear evidence of glacial man was discovered in\r\nEurope, the problem is so much simpler on the Western Continent that\r\nwe shall find it profitable to study the American facts first. We will\r\ntherefore present a summary of them at once, and then proceed to the more\r\nobscure problems of European archæology.\r\n\r\nThe first definite discovery of human relics clearly connected with,\r\nglacial deposits in America, and of the same age with them, was made\r\nby Dr. C. C. Abbott, at Trenton, N. J., in the year 1875. The city of\r\nTrenton is built upon a delta terrace about three miles wide which\r\noccurs at the head of tide-water on the Delaware River. This terrace\r\nbears every mark of having been deposited by a torrential stream which\r\ncame down the valley during the closing period of the great Ice age. The\r\nmaterial of which the terrace consists is all water-worn. According to\r\nthe description of Professor N. S. Shaler:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--The glaciated portion is shaded. The shading\r\non the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers indicates glacial terraces, which are\r\nabsent from the Schuylkill.]\r\n\r\n\"The general structure of the mass is neither that of ordinary\r\nboulder-clay nor of stratified gravels, such as are formed by the\r\ncomplete rearrangement by water of the elements of simple drift-deposits.\r\nIt is made up of boulders, pebbles, and sand, varying in size from masses\r\ncontaining one hundred cubic feet or more to the finest sand of the\r\nordinary sea-beaches. There is little trace of true clay in the deposit;\r\nthere is rarely enough to give the least trace of cementation to the\r\nmasses. The various elements are rather confusedly arranged; the large\r\nboulders not being grouped on any particular level, and their major\r\naxes not always distinctly coinciding with the horizon. All the pebbles\r\nand boulders, so far as observed, are smooth and water-worn, a careful\r\nsearch having failed to show evidence of distinct glacial scratching\r\nor polishing on their surfaces. The type of pebble is the subovate or\r\ndiscoidal, and though many depart from this form, yet nearly all observed\r\nby me had been worn so as to show that their shape had been determined by\r\nrunning water. The materials comprising the deposit are very varied, but\r\nall I observed could apparently with reason be supposed to have come from\r\nthe extensive valley of the river near which they lie, except perhaps the\r\nfragments of some rather rare hypogene rocks.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Palæolith found by Abbott in New Jersey,\r\nslightly reduced.]\r\n\r\nA conclusive proof of the relation of this Trenton delta terrace to the\r\nGlacial period is found in the fact that the gravel deposit is continuous\r\nwith terraces extending up the trough of the valley of the Delaware to\r\nthe glaciated area and beyond. As, however, the descent of the river-bed\r\nis rapid (about four feet to the mile) from the glacial border down to\r\ntide-water, the terrace is not remarkably high, being only about fifteen\r\nor twenty feet above the present flood-plain. But it is continuous,\r\nand similar in composition with the great enlargement in the delta at\r\nTrenton. Without doubt, therefore, the deposit represents the overwash\r\ngravel of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\nFortunately for science, Dr. C. C. Abbott, whose tastes for archæological\r\ninvestigations were early developed, had his residence upon the border\r\nof this glacial delta terrace at Trenton, and as early as 1875 began\r\nto find rough-stone implements of a peculiar type in the talus of\r\nthe bank where the river was undermining the terrace. In turning his\r\nattention to the numerous fresh exposures of gravel made by railroad and\r\nother excavations during the following year, he found several of the\r\nimplements in undisturbed strata, some of which were sixteen feet below\r\nthe surface. Since that time he has continued to make discoveries at\r\nvarious intervals. In 1888 he had found four hundred implements of the\r\npalæolithic type at Trenton, sixty of which had been taken from recorded\r\ndepths in the gravel, two hundred and fifty from the talus at the bluff\r\nfacing the river, and the remainder from the surface, or derived from\r\ncollectors who did not record the positions or circumstances under which\r\nthey were found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--Section across the Delaware River at Trenton.\r\nNew Jersey: _a_, _a_, Philadelphia red gravel and brick-clay (McGee's\r\nColumbia deposit); _b_. _b_, Trenton gravel, in which the implements are\r\nfound: _c_, present flood-plain of the Delaware River (after Lewis).\r\n(From Abbott's Primitive Industry.)]\r\n\r\nThe material from which the implements at Trenton are made is\r\nargillite--that is, a clay slate which has been so metamorphosed as to\r\nbe susceptible of fracture, almost like flint. It is, however, by no\r\nmeans capable of being worked into such delicate forms as flint is. But\r\nas it is the only material in the vicinity capable of being chipped,\r\nprehistoric men of that vicinity were compelled to make a virtue of\r\nnecessity and use the inferior material. Of all the implements found by\r\nDr. Abbott in the gravel, only one was flint; while upon the surface\r\ninnumerable arrow-heads of flint have been found. The transition, also,\r\nin the type of implements is as sudden as that in the kind of material\r\nof which they are made. Below the superficial deposit of black soil,\r\nextending down to the depth of about one foot, the modern Indian flint\r\nimplements entirely disappear, and implements of palæolithic type only\r\nare found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Section of the Trenton gravel in which the\r\nimplements described in the text are found. The shelf on which the man\r\nstands is made in process of excavation. The gravel is the same above and\r\nbelow (photograph by Abbott).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Face view of argillite implement, found by Dr.\r\nC. C. Abbott, in 1876, at Trenton, New Jersey, in gravel, three feet\r\nfrom face of bluff, and twenty-two feet from the surface (No. 10,985)\r\n(Putnam).]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1882, after I had traced the glacial boundary westward from\r\nthe Delaware River, across the States of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana,\r\nI was struck with the similarity between the terrace at Trenton and\r\nnumerous terraces which I had attributed to the Glacial age in Ohio and\r\nthe other States. It adds much to the interest of subsequent discoveries\r\nto note that in 1884, in my report to the Western Reserve Historical\r\nSociety upon the glacial boundary of Ohio, I wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Argillite implement found by Dr. C. C Abbott,\r\nMarch, 1879, at A. K. Rowan's farm, Trenton, New Jersey, in gravel\r\nsixteen feet from surface: a, face view; b, side view (No. 11,286)\r\n(Putnam).]\r\n\r\n\"The gravel in which they [Dr. Abbott's implements] are found is glacial\r\ngravel deposited upon the banks of the Delaware when, during the last\r\nstages of the Glacial period, the river was swollen with vast floods of\r\nwater from the melting ice. Man was on this continent at that period\r\nwhen the climate and ice of Greenland extended to the mouth of New York\r\nHarbor. The probability is, that if he was in New Jersey at that time, he\r\nwas also upon the banks of the Ohio, and the extensive terrace and gravel\r\ndeposits in the southern part of our State should be closely scanned\r\nby archæologists. When observers become familiar with the rude form of\r\nthese palæolithic implements, they will doubtless find them in abundance.\r\nBut whether we find them or not in this State [Ohio], if you admit, as\r\nI am compelled to do, the genuineness of those found by Dr. Abbott, our\r\ninvestigation into the glacial phenomena of Ohio must have an important\r\narchæological significance, for they bear upon the question of the\r\nchronology of the Glacial period, and so upon that of man's appearance in\r\nNew Jersey.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Chipped pebble of black chert, found by Dr. C.\r\nL. Metz. October, 1885, at Madisonville, Ohio, in gravel eight feet from\r\nsurface under clay: _a_, face view; _b_, side view.]\r\n\r\nThe expectation of finding evidence of preglacial man in Ohio was\r\njustified soon after this (in 1885), when Dr. C L. Metz, while\r\nco-co-operating with Professor F. W. Putnam, of the Peabody Museum,\r\nCambridge, Mass., in field work, discovered a flint implement of\r\npalæolithic type in undisturbed strata of the glacial terrace of the\r\nLittle Miami River, near his residence at Madisonville, Ohio. In 1887\r\nDr. Metz found another implement in the terrace of the same river, at\r\nLoveland, about twenty-five miles farther up the stream. The implement\r\nat Madisonville occurred eight feet below the surface, and about a mile\r\nback from the edge of the terrace; while that at Loveland was found in a\r\ncoarser deposit, about a quarter of a mile back from the present stream,\r\nand thirty feet below the surface. Mastodon-bones also were discovered in\r\nclose proximity to the implement at Loveland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.]\r\n\r\nInterest in these investigations was still further increased by the\r\nreport of Mr. Hilborne T. Cresson, of Philadelphia, that in 1886, with\r\nmy map of the glaciated region in hand, he had found an implement of\r\npalæolithic type in undisturbed strata of the glacial terrace bordering\r\nthe East Branch of White River, near the glacial boundary at Medora,\r\nJackson County, Ind. The terrace was about fifty feet above the\r\nflood-plain of the river.\r\n\r\nLater still, in October, 1889, Mr. W. C. Mills, of Newcomerstown,\r\nTuscarawas County, Ohio, found in that town a finely shaped flint\r\nimplement sixteen feet below the surface of the terrace of glacial\r\ngravel which lines the margin of the Tuscarawas Valley.[CT] Mr. Mills\r\nwas not aware of the importance of this discovery until meeting with\r\nme some months later, when he described the situation to me, and soon\r\nafter sent the implement for examination. In company with Judge C.\r\nC. Baldwin, President of the Western Reserve Historical Society, and\r\nseveral others, a visit was made to Mr. Mills, and we carefully examined\r\nthe gravel-pit in which the implement occurred, and collected evidence\r\nwhich was abundant to corroborate all his statements. The implement\r\nin question is made from a peculiar flint which is found in the Lower\r\nMercer limestone, of which there are outcrops a few miles distant, and\r\nit resembles in so many ways the typical implements found by Boucher de\r\nPerthes, at Abbeville, that, except for the difference in the material\r\nfrom which it is made, it would be impossible to distinguish it from\r\nthem. The similarity of pattern is too minute to have originated except\r\nfrom imitation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote CT: For typical section of a glacial terrace in Ohio, see p.\r\n227.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--The smaller is the palæolith from Newcomerstown,\r\nthe larger from Amiens (face view), reduced one half in diameter.]\r\n\r\nIn 1877, a year after the discoveries by Dr. Abbott in New Jersey, some\r\nrude quartz implements were discovered by Professor N. H. Winchell in\r\nthe glacial terraces of the upper Mississippi, in the vicinity of Little\r\nFalls, Morrison County, Minn. This locality was afterwards more fully\r\nexplored by Miss Franc E. Babbitt, who succeeded in finding so large a\r\nnumber of the implements as to set at rest all question concerning their\r\nhuman origin. According to Mr. Warren Upham, the glacial flood-plain\r\nof the Mississippi is here about three miles wide, with an elevation\r\nof from twenty-five to thirty feet above the river. It is in a stream\r\nnear the bottom of this glacial terrace that the most of Miss Babbitt's\r\ndiscoveries were made, and Mr. Upham has pretty clearly shown that the\r\ngravel of the terrace overlying them was mostly deposited while the\r\nice-front was still lingering about sixty miles farther north, in the\r\nvicinity of Itasca Lake.[CU]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CU: For a general map, see p. 66; also p. 225.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--Edge view of the preceding.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Section across the Mississippi Valley at Little\r\nFalls, Minnesota, showing the stratum in which chipped quartz fragments\r\nwere found by Miss F. E. Babbitt, as described in the text (Upham).]\r\n\r\nUp to this time the above are all the instances in which the relics\r\nof man are directly and indubitably connected with deposits of this\r\nparticular period east of the Rocky Mountains. Probably it is incorrect\r\nto speak of these as preglacial, for the portion of the period at which\r\nthe deposits incorporating human relics were made is well on towards the\r\nclose of the great Ice age, since these terraces were, in some cases, and\r\nmay have been in all cases, deposited after the ice-front had withdrawn\r\nnearly, if not quite, to the water-shed of the St Lawrence basin. It may\r\nbe difficult to demonstrate this with reference to the gravel deposits at\r\nTrenton, Madisonville, and Medora, but it is evident at a glance in the\r\ncase of Newcomerstown and Little Falls.\r\n\r\nThat the implement-bearing gravel of Trenton, N. J., belongs to the\r\nlater stages of the Glacial period is evident from its relation to what\r\nProfessor H. Carvill Lewis called \"the Philadelphia red gravel and\r\nbrick-clay,\" but which, from its large development in the District of\r\nColumbia at Washington, is called by Mr. McGee the \"Columbia deposit.\"\r\nThe city of Philadelphia is built upon this formation in the Delaware\r\nValley, and the brick for its houses is obtained from it; the cellar\r\nof each house ordinarily furnishing clay enough for its brick walls.\r\nThis clay is of course a deposit in comparatively still water, which\r\nwould imply deposition during a period of land subsidence. But that it\r\nwas ice-laden water which flooded the banks is shown by the frequent\r\noccurrence of large blocks of stone in the deposits, such as could have\r\nbeen transported only in connection with floating ice. The boulders in\r\nthe Columbia formation clearly belong to the individual river valleys in\r\nwhich they are found, and doubtless are to be connected with the flooded\r\ncondition of those valleys when, by means of a northerly subsidence, the\r\ngradient of the streams was considerably less than now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--Quartz implement, found by Miss F. E. Babbitt,\r\n1878, at Little Falls, Minnesota, in modified drift, fifteen feet below\r\nsurface: _a_, face view; _b_, profile view. The black represented on the\r\ncut is the matrix of the quartz vein (No. 31,323) (Putnam).]\r\n\r\nThere is some difference of opinion in respect to the extent of\r\nthis subsidence, and, indeed, respecting the height attained by the\r\nPhiladelphia brick-clay, or McGee's Columbia deposit. Professor Lewis\r\n(whose residence was at Philadelphia, and who had devoted much time to\r\nfield observations) insisted that the deposit could not be found higher\r\nthan from 180 to 200 feet above the immediate flood-plain of the river\r\nvalleys where they occur. But, without entering upon this disputed\r\nquestion, it is sufficient to consider the bearing of the facts that are\r\naccepted by all--namely, that towards the close of the Glacial period\r\nthere was a marked subsidence of the land on the eastern coast of North\r\nAmerica, increasing towards the north.\r\n\r\nFully to comprehend the situation, we need to bring before the mind some\r\nof the indirect effects of the Glacial period in this region. The most\r\nimportant of these was the necessary projection of subglacial conditions\r\nover a considerable belt of territory to the south of that actually\r\nreached by glacial ice; so that, while there are no clear indications of\r\nthe existence of local glaciers in the Appalachian Mountains south of the\r\ncentral part of Pennsylvania, there are many indications of increased\r\nsnow-fall upon the mountains, connected with prolonged winters and with a\r\ngreat increase of spring floods and ice-gorges upon the annual breaking\r\nup of winter.\r\n\r\nThese facts have been stated in detail by Mr. McGee,[CV] from whose\r\nreport it appears that, on the Potomac at Washington, the surface of\r\nthe Columbia deposit is 150 feet above tide, and that the deposit itself\r\ncontains many boulders, some of which are as much as two or three feet in\r\ndiameter. These are mingled with the gravel in such a way as to show that\r\nthey must have been brought down by floating ice from the head-waters of\r\nthe Potomac when the winters were much more severe than now. That this\r\ndeposit is properly the work of the river is shown by the entire absence\r\nof marine shells.\r\n\r\n[Footnote CV: Seventh Annual Report of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey for 1885 and 1886, pp. 537-646.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. McGee, also, there is a gradual decrease in the height\r\nof these delta terraces of the Columbia period as they recede from the\r\nglacial boundary--that at the mouth of the Susquehanna being 245 feet,\r\nthat of the Potomac 140 feet, that on the Rappahannock 125, that on the\r\nJames 100, and that on the Roanoke 75; while the size of the transported\r\nboulders along the streams also gradually diminishes in the same order.\r\nDuring the Columbia period the Susquehanna River transported boulders\r\nfifty times the size now transported, while the Potomac transported them\r\nonly up to twenty times, the Rappahannock only ten times, the James\r\nonly five, and the Roanoke only two or three times the size of those\r\nnow transported. This progressive diminution, both in the extent of the\r\ndeposit and in the coarseness of the material deposited by these rivers\r\nat about the time of the maximum portion of the Glacial period, is what\r\nwould naturally be expected under the conditions supposed to exist in\r\nconnection with the great Ice age, and is an important confirmation of\r\nthe glacial theory.\r\n\r\nThat the period of subsidence and more intense glacial conditions during\r\nwhich the Columbia deposits took place, preceded, by a long interval, the\r\ndeposition of the gravel terraces at Trenton, N. J., and the analogous\r\ndeposits in the Mississippi Valley where palæolithic implements have been\r\nfound, is evident enough. The Trenton gravel was deposited in a recess in\r\nthe Columbia deposit which had been previously worn out by the stream.\r\nIndeed, in every place where opportunity offers for direct observation\r\nthe Trenton gravel is seen to be distinctly subsequent to the other. It\r\nwas not _buried by_ the Philadelphia red gravel and brick-clay, but to a\r\nlimited degree overlies and _buries_ it.\r\n\r\nThe data for measuring the absolute length of time between these two\r\nstages of the Glacial period are very indefinite. Mr. McGee, however,\r\nsupposes that since the Columbia period a sufficient time has elapsed\r\nfor the falls of the Susquehanna to recede more than twenty miles and\r\nfor those of the Potomac eighteen miles, and this through a rock which\r\nis exceedingly obdurate. But, in channels opening, as these do, freely\r\noutward, it is difficult to tell in what epochs the erosion has been\r\nprincipally performed, since there are no buried channels, as in the\r\nglaciated area, enabling us to determine whether or not much of the\r\neroding work of the river may have been accomplished in preglacial times.\r\n\r\nThe lapse of time which, upon the least calculation, separates the\r\nColumbia epoch from the Trenton, gives unusual importance to any\r\ndiscovery of palæolithic implements which may be made in the earlier\r\ndeposits. We are bound, therefore, to consider with special caution\r\nthe reported discovery of an implement in these deposits at Claymont,\r\nDelaware. The discovery was made by Dr. Hilborne T. Cresson, on July 13,\r\n1887, during the progress of an extensive excavation in constructing the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, nineteen miles south of Philadelphia. The\r\nimplement was from eight to nine feet below the surface. As there is so\r\nmuch chance for error of judgment respecting the undisturbed condition\r\nof the strata, and as there was so little opportunity for Dr. Cresson to\r\nverify his conclusion, we may well wait for the cumulative support of\r\nother discoveries before building a theory upon it; still, it will be\r\nprofitable to consider the situation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--Argillite implement, found by H. T. Cresson,\r\n1887, in Baltimore and Ohio Railroad cut, one mile from Claymont,\r\nDelaware, in Columbia gravel, eight to nine feet below the overlying clay\r\nbed: _a_, face view; _b_, side view (No. 45,726) (Putnam).]\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. McGee and myself have visited the locality with Dr. Cresson, and\r\nthere can be no doubt that the implement occurred underneath the Columbia\r\ngravel. The line of demarcation is here very sharp between that gravel\r\nand the decomposed strata of underlying gneiss rock, which appears in\r\nour illustration as a light band in the middle of the section exposed.\r\nSome large boulders which could have been moved only in connection with\r\nfloating ice are found in the overlying deposit near by. This excavation\r\nis about one mile and a half west of the Delaware River, and about 150\r\nfeet above it, being nearly at the uppermost limit of the Columbia\r\ndeposit in that vicinity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--General section of Baltimore and Ohio cut,\r\nnear Claymont, Delaware, where Mr. Cresson found palæolithic implements\r\nfigured in the text (from photograph by Cresson).]\r\n\r\nThe age of these deposits in which implements have been found at\r\nClaymont and at Trenton will be referred to again when we come to the\r\nspecific discussion of the date of the Glacial period. It is sufficient\r\nhere to bring before our minds clearly, first, the fact that this at\r\nClaymont is connected with the river floods accompanying the ice at its\r\ntime of maximum extension, and when there was a gradually increasing\r\nor differential depression of the country to an unknown extent to the\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nTwo radically different theories are presented to account for the\r\ndeposits variously known as the Columbia gravel and the Philadelphia\r\nbrick-clay. Mr. McGee, in the monograph above referred to, supposes them\r\nto have been deposited during a period of a general subsidence of the\r\ncoast-line; so that they took place at about tide-level. Mr. Upham, on\r\nthe other hand, supposes them to have been deposited during the period\r\nof general elevation to whose influence he mainly attributes the Glacial\r\nperiod itself. In his view much of the shallow sea-bottom adjoining\r\nthe present shore off from Delaware and Chesapeake Bays was then a\r\nland-surface, and the Hudson, the Delaware, and the Susquehanna Rivers,\r\ncoming down from the still higher elevations of the north, flowed through\r\nextensive plains so related to the northern areas of elevation that\r\ndeposition was occurring in their valleys, owing in part to the flooded\r\ncondition of the streams, in part to the differential elevation, and in\r\npart to the superabundance of silt and other _débris_ furnished by the\r\nmelting ice-sheet in the head-waters of these streams.\r\n\r\nThe deposits of Trenton gravel occurred much later, at a time when the\r\nice had melted far back towards the head-waters of the Delaware, and\r\nafter the land had nearly resumed its present relations of level, if\r\nindeed it had not risen northward to a still greater relative height.\r\n\r\nAs would be expected from the climatic conditions accompanying the\r\nGlacial epoch, man's companions in the animal world were very different\r\nduring the period when the high-level river gravels of America were\r\nforming from those with which he is now associated. From the remains\r\nactually discovered, either in these gravels or in close proximity to\r\nthem, we infer that, while the mastodon was the most frequent of the\r\nextinct quadrupeds with which man then had to contend in that region, he\r\nmust have been familiar also with the walrus, the Greenland reindeer, the\r\ncaribou, the bison, the moose, and the musk ox.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the Glacial Terraces of Europe._\r\n\r\nThe existence of glacial man in Europe was first determined in connection\r\nwith the high-level river gravels already described in the valley of the\r\nSomme, situated in Picardy in the northern part of France. Here in 1841\r\nBoucher de Perthes began to discover rudely fashioned stone implements\r\nin undisturbed strata of the gravel terraces, whose connection with\r\nthe Glacial period we have already made clear. But for nearly twenty\r\nyears his discoveries were ignored by scientific men, although he made\r\npersistent efforts to get the facts before them, and published a full\r\naccount of them with illustrations as early as 1847. Some suggested fraud\r\non the part of the workmen; others without examination declared that the\r\ngravel must have been disturbed; while others, still, denied altogether\r\nthe artificial character of the implements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Section across valley of the Somme: 1, peat,\r\ntwenty to thirty feet thick, resting on gravel, _a_; 2, lower-level\r\ngravels, with elephant-bones and flint implements, covered with\r\nriver-loam twenty to forty feet thick; 3, upper-level gravels, with\r\nsimilar fossils covered with loam, in all, thirty feet thick; 4,\r\nupland-loam, five to six feet thick; 5, Eocene-Tertiary.]\r\n\r\nAt length, Dr. Regillout, an eminent physician residing at Amiens,\r\nabout forty miles higher up the Somme than Abbeville, visited Boucher\r\nde Perthes, and, upon seeing the similarity between the gravel terraces\r\nat Abbeville and Amiens, returned home to look for similar implements\r\nin the high-level gravel-pits at St. Acheul, a suburb of Amiens. Almost\r\nimmediately he discovered flint implements there of the same pattern with\r\nthose at Abbeville, and in undisturbed strata of the gravel terrace,\r\nwhere it rested on the original chalk formation, at a height of 90 feet\r\nabove the river. In the course of four years, Dr. Regillout found several\r\nhundred of these implements, and in 1854 published an illustrated report\r\nupon the discoveries.\r\n\r\nStill the scientific world remained incredulous until the years 1858 and\r\n1859, when Dr. Falconer, Mr. Prestwich, Mr. John Evans, Mr. Flower, Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, of England, and MM. Pouchet and Gaudry, of France, visited\r\nAbbeville and Amiens, and succeeded in making similar discoveries for\r\nthemselves. Additional discoveries at St. Acheul have continued up to\r\nthe present time whenever excavations have gone on at the gravel-pits.\r\nMr. Prestwich estimates that there is an implement to every cubic metre\r\nof gravel, and says that he himself has brought away at different times\r\nmore than two hundred specimens, and that the total number found in this\r\none locality can hardly be under four thousand. \"The gravel-beds are on\r\nthe brow of a hill 97 feet above the river Somme,\" and besides the relics\r\nof man contain numerous fluviatile and land shells together with \"teeth\r\nand bones of the mammoth, rhinoceros, horse, reindeer, and red deer, but\r\nnot of the hippopotamus,\"[CW] bones of the latter animal being found here\r\nonly in the gravels of the lower terraces, where they are less than\r\nthirty feet above the river, and mark a considerably later stage in the\r\nerosion of the valley. While many of the implements found at Amiens seem\r\nto have been somewhat worn and rolled, \"others are as sharp and fresh\r\nas when first made.... The bedding of the gravel is extremely irregular\r\nand contorted, as though it had been pushed about by a force acting from\r\nabove; and this, together with the occurrence of blocks of Tertiary\r\nsandstone of considerable size, leads to the inference that both are due\r\nto the action of river-ice. In the Seine Valley blocks of still larger\r\nsize, and transported from greater distances, are found in gravels of the\r\nsame age.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote CW: Prestwich's Geology, vol. ii, p. 481.]\r\n\r\n\"Flint implements are found under similar conditions in many of the\r\nriver-valleys of other parts of France, especially in the neighbourhood\r\nof Paris; of Mons in Belgium; in Spain, in the neighbourhood of\r\nMadrid, in Portugal, in Italy, and in Greece; but they have not been\r\ndiscovered in the drift-beds of Denmark, Sweden, or Russia, nor is there\r\nany well-authenticated instance of the occurrence of palæoliths in\r\nGermany.\"[CX]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CX: Prestwich's Geology, vol. ii, pp. 481, 482.]\r\n\r\nWhen once the fact had been established that man was in northern France\r\nat the time of the deposition of the high-level gravels of the Somme and\r\nthe Seine, renewed attention was directed to terraces of similar age in\r\nsouthern England. One of these is that upon which the city of London is\r\nbuilt, and which, according to Lyell's description, \"extends from above\r\nMaidenhead through the metropolis to the sea, a distance from west to\r\neast of fifty miles, having a width varying from two to nine miles. Its\r\nthickness ranges commonly from five to fifteen feet.\"[CY]\r\n\r\n[Footnote CY: Antiquity of Man, pp. 154, 155.]\r\n\r\nFor a long time geologists had been familiar with the fact that these\r\nterraces of the Thames contain the remains of numerous extinct animals,\r\namong which are included the mammoth and a species of rhinoceros.\r\nUpon directing special attention to the subject, it was found that, at\r\nvarious intervals, the remains of man, also, had been reported from the\r\nsame deposits. As long ago as 1715 Mr. Conyers discovered a palæolithic\r\nimplement, in connection with the skeleton of an elephant, at Black\r\nMary's, near Gray's Inn Lane, London. This implement is preserved in the\r\nBritish Museum, and closely resembles typical specimens from the gravel\r\nat Amiens. Other implements of similar character have been found in\r\nthe valley of the Wey near Guilford, also in the valley of the Darent,\r\nnear Whitstable in Kent, and between Heme Bay and the Reculvers. While\r\nthe exact position of these implements in the gravel had not been so\r\npositively noted as in the case of those found at Amiens and Abbeville,\r\nthere can be little doubt that man, in company with the extinct animals\r\nmentioned, inhabited the valley of the Thames at a period when its annual\r\nfloods spread over the whole terrace-plain upon which the main part of\r\nLondon is built.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Ouse, however, near Bedford, the discovery of\r\npalæolithic implements in the gravel terraces connected with the\r\nGlacial period and in intimate association with bones of the elephant,\r\nrhinoceros, hippopotamus, and other extinct animals, has been as fully\r\nestablished as in the valley of the Somme. The discoveries here were\r\nfirst made in the year 1860, by Mr. James Wyatt, in a gravel-pit at\r\nBiddenham, two miles northwest of Bedford. Two flint implements were\r\nthrown out by workmen in one day from undisturbed strata thirteen feet\r\nbelow the surface, and numerous other specimens have since been found in\r\na similar situation.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Ouse is bordered on either side by sections of a\r\nsuperficial blanket of glacial drift containing many transported boulders\r\nof considerable size. The valley is here about two miles wide, and ninety\r\nfeet deep. The gravel deposit, however, in which the implements were\r\nfound, is only about thirty feet above the present level of the river,\r\nand hence represents the middle period of the work of the river in\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nAnother locality in England in which similar discoveries have been made,\r\nis at Hoxne, about five miles from Diss, in Suffolk County. Like that\r\nin the valley of the Thames, however, the implements were found a long\r\ntime before the significance of the discovery was recognized. Mr. John\r\nFrere reported the discovery to the Society of Antiquaries in 1801,\r\nand gave some of the implements both to the society and to the British\r\nMuseum, in whose collections they are still preserved. The implements are\r\nof the true palæolithic type, and existed in such abundance, and were\r\nso free from signs of wear, that the conclusion seemed probable that a\r\nmanufactory of them had been uncovered. As many as five or six to the\r\nsquare yard are said to have been found. Indeed, their numbers were so\r\ngreat that the workmen \"had emptied baskets of them into the ruts of the\r\nadjoining road before becoming aware of their value.\"\r\n\r\nThe deposit in which they are found is situated in the valley of Gold\r\nBrook, a tributary of the Waveney. The implements occurred about twelve\r\nfeet below the surface, in fresh-water deposits, filling a hollow eroded\r\nin the glacial deposit covering that part of England. This, therefore, is\r\nclearly either of post-glacial or of late glacial age.\r\n\r\nStill another locality in which similar palæolithic implements were found\r\nin undisturbed gravel of this same age in eastern England is Icklingham,\r\nin the valley of the Lark, where the situation is quite similar to that\r\nalready described at Bedford, on the Ouse.\r\n\r\nThe last place we will stop to mention in England which was visited\r\nby palæolithic man, during or soon after the Glacial epoch, is to be\r\nfound in the vicinity of Southampton. At this time the Isle of Wight\r\nwas joined to the mainland, and not improbably England itself to the\r\nContinent. The river, then flowing through the depression of the Solent\r\nand the Southampton Water, occupied a much higher level than now, leaving\r\nterraces along the shore at various places, in which the tools of\r\npalæolithic man have been discovered.\r\n\r\nThough these are the best authenticated discoveries connecting man with\r\nthe Glacial period in England, they are by no means the only probable\r\ncases. Almost every valley of southern England furnishes evidence of a\r\nsimilar but less demonstrative character.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Cave Deposits._\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the remains of man in the high-level river-gravels\r\ndeposited near the close of the Glacial period led to a revision of the\r\nevidence which had from time to time been reported connecting the remains\r\nof man with those of various extinct animals in cave deposits both in\r\nEngland and upon the Continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The British Isles._\r\n\r\nAs early as 1826, Rev. J. MacEnery, a Roman Catholic priest residing\r\nnear Torquay, in Devonshire, England, had made some most remarkable\r\ndiscoveries in a cavern at Kent's Hole, near his home; but, owing to his\r\nearly death, and to the incredulity of that generation of scientific\r\nmen, his story was neither credited nor published till 1859. About this\r\ntime, a new cave having been discovered not far away, at Brixham, the\r\nbest qualified members of the Royal Society (Lyell, Phillips, Lubbock,\r\nEvans, Vivian, Pengelly, Busk, Dawkins, and Sanford) were deputed to see\r\nthat it was carefully explored. Mr. Pengelly, who had had twenty years'\r\nexperience in similar explorations, directed and superintended the work.\r\nEvery portion of the contents was examined with minutest care. Kent's\r\nHole is \"180 to 190 feet above the level of mean tide, and about 70 feet\r\nabove the bottom of the valley immediately adjacent.\"[CZ] In one chamber\r\nthe excavation was about sixty feet square. The contents were arranged in\r\nthe following order:\r\n\r\n[Footnote CZ: Dawkins's Cave-Hunting, p. 325.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--Mouth of Kent's Hole.]\r\n\r\n1. A surface of dark earth a few inches thick, containing Roman pottery,\r\niron and bronze spear-heads, together with polished stone weapons. There\r\nwere, too, in this stratum bones of cows, goats, and horses, mingled with\r\nlarge quantities of charcoal.\r\n\r\n2. Below this was a stalagmite floor from one to three feet thick, formed\r\nby the dripping of lime-water from the roof.\r\n\r\n3. Under this crust of stalagmite was a compact deposit of red earth,\r\nfrom two to thirteen feet thick.[DA] Flint implements of various kinds\r\nand charcoal were also found at different depths; also an awl, or\r\npiercer; a needle with the eye large enough to admit small pack-thread;\r\nand three harpoon-heads made out of bone and deer's horn.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DA: Dawkins's Cave-Hunting, p. 326; Lyell's Antiquity of Man,\r\np. 101.]\r\n\r\n4. Flint implements were also obtained in a conglomerate (breccia) still\r\nbelow this. The fossil bones in this cave belonged to the same species of\r\nanimals as those discovered in a cave near Wells.\r\n\r\nThe Brixham cave occurs near the small village of that name, not far from\r\nTorquay. The entrance to it is about ninety-five feet above high water.\r\nIts deposits, in descending order, are: 1. Stalagmitic floor from six to\r\ntwelve or fifteen inches in thickness. 2. A thin breccia of limestone\r\nfragments cemented together by carbonate of lime. This had accumulated\r\nabout the mouth, so as to fill up the entrance. 3. A layer of blackish\r\nearth about one foot in thickness 4. A deposit of from two to four feet\r\nthick, consisting of clayey loam, mingled with fragments of limestone,\r\nfrom small bits up to rocks weighing a ton. Bounded pebbles of other\r\nmaterial were also occasionally met with. 5. Shingle consisting of\r\nrounded pebbles largely of foreign material.\r\n\r\nAll these strata, except the third, contained fossils of some kind, but\r\nthe fourth was by far the richest repository. Among the bones found are\r\nthose of the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the horse, the ox, the\r\nreindeer, the cave-lion, the cave-hyena, and the cave-bear. Associated\r\nwith these remains a number of worked flints was found. In one place\r\nthe bones of an entire leg of a cave-bear occurred in such a position as\r\nto show that they must have been bound together by the ligaments when\r\nthey were buried. Immediately below these bones a flint implement was\r\nfound.[DB]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DB: See Pengelly's Reports to the Devonshire Association, 1867.]\r\n\r\nThe hyena's den, at Wookey Hole, near Wells, in Somerset, was carefully\r\nexplored by Professor Boyd Dawkins, who stood by and examined every\r\nshovelful of material as it was thrown out.\r\n\r\nThis cave alone yielded 35 specimens of palæolithic art, 467 jaws and\r\nteeth of the cave-hyena, 15 of the cave lion, 27 of the cave-bear, 11 of\r\nthe grizzly bear, 11 of the brown bear, 7 of the wolf, 8 of the fox, 30\r\nof the mammoth, 233 of the woolly rhinoceros, 401 of the horse, 16 of the\r\nwild ox, 30 of the bison, 35 of the Irish elk, and 30 of the reindeer\r\n(jaws and teeth only).\r\n\r\nIn Derbyshire numerous caves were explored by Professor Dawkins at Cress\r\nwell Crags, which, in addition to flint implements and the remains of\r\nthe animals occurring in the Brixham cave, yielded the bones of the\r\nmachairodus, an extinct species of tiger or lion which lived during the\r\nTertiary period.\r\n\r\nThe Victoria cave, near Settle, in west Yorkshire, is the only other one\r\nin England which we need to mention. In this there were no remains found\r\nwhich could be positively identified as human, but the animal remains\r\nin the lower strata of the cave deposit were so different from those in\r\nthe upper bed as to indicate the great lapse of time which separated the\r\ntwo. This cave is 1,450 feet above the sea-level, and there were found in\r\nthe upper strata of the floor, down to a depth of from two to ten feet,\r\nmany remains of existing animals. Then, for a distance of twelve feet,\r\nthere occurred a clay deposit, containing no organic remains whatever,\r\nbut some well-scratched boulders. Below this was a third stratum of earth\r\nmingled with limestone fragments, at the base of which were numerous\r\nremains of the mammoth, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, bison, hyena, etc.\r\nOne bone occurred which was by some supposed to be human, but by others\r\nto have belonged to a bear. This lower stratum is, without much doubt,\r\npreglacial, and the thickness of the deposit intervening between it and\r\nthe upper fossiliferous bed is taken by some to indicate the great lapse\r\nof time separating the period of the mammoth and rhinoceros in England\r\nfrom the modern age. The scratched boulders in the middle stratum of\r\nlaminated clay, would indicate certainly that the material found its way\r\ninto the cave during the Glacial epoch, when ice filled the whole valley\r\nof the Ribble, which flows past the foot of the hill, and whose bed is\r\n900 feet below the mouth of the cave.\r\n\r\nIn North Wales the Vale of Clwyd contains numerous caves which were\r\noccupied by hyenas in preglacial times and with their bones are\r\nassociated those of the mammoth, the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the\r\ncave-lion, the cave-bear, and various other animals. Flint implements\r\nalso were found in the cave at Cae Gwyn, near the village of Tremeirchon,\r\non the eastern side of the valley, opposite Cefn, and about four miles\r\ndistant. We have already given an illustration of the Cefn cave (see\r\npage 148). It will be observed that this valley of the Clwyd opens to\r\nthe north, and has a pretty rapid descent to the sea from the Welsh\r\nmountains, and was in position to be obstructed by the Irish Sea glacier,\r\nso as to have been occupied at times by one of the characteristic\r\nmarginal lakes of the Glacial period. It is evident also that the\r\nnorthern ice prevailed over the Welsh ice for a considerable portion\r\nof the lower part of the valley; for northern drift is the superficial\r\ndeposit upon the hills on the sides of the valley up to a height of over\r\n500 feet. From the investigations of Mr. C. E. De Rance, F. G. S.,[DC]\r\nit is equally clear also that the northern drift, which until lately\r\nsealed up the entrance of the cave, was subsequent to its occupation by\r\nman, and this was the opinion formed by Sir Archibald Geikie, Director\r\nGeneral of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom, as the result of\r\nspecial investigations which he made of the matter.[DD]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DC: Proceedings of the Yorkshire Geological Society for 1888,\r\npp. 1-20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DD: See De Ranee, as above, p. 17; and article by H. Hicks,\r\nin Quarterly Journal of Geological Society, vol. xlii, p. 3; Geological\r\nMagazine, May, 1885, p. 510.]\r\n\r\nFrom the caves in the Vale of Clwyd as many as 400 teeth of rhinoceros,\r\n500 of horse, 180 of hyena, and 15 of mammoth have been taken. A section\r\nof the cave deposits in the cave at Cae Gwyn is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Below the soil for about eight feet a tolerably stiff boulder-clay,\r\ncontaining many ice-scratched boulders and narrow bands and pockets of\r\nsand. Below this about seven feet of gravel and sand, with here and\r\nthere bands of red clay, having also many ice-scratched boulders. The\r\nnext deposit was a laminated brown clay, and under this was found the\r\nbone-earth, a brown, sandy clay with small pebbles and with angular\r\nfragments of limestone, stalagmites, and stalactites. During the\r\nexcavations it became clear that the bones had been greatly disturbed by\r\nwater action; that the stalagmite floor, in parts more than a foot in\r\nthickness, and massive stalactites, had also been broken and thrown about\r\nin all positions; and that these had been covered afterwards by clays and\r\nsand containing foreign pebbles. This seemed to prove that the caverns,\r\nnow 400 feet above ordnance datum, must have been submerged subsequently\r\nto their occupation by the animals and by man. In Dr. Hicks's opinion,\r\nthe contents of the cavern must have been disturbed by marine action\r\nduring the great submergence in mid-glacial times, and afterwards\r\ncovered by marine sands and by an upper boulder-clay, identical in\r\ncharacter with that found at many points in the Vale of Clwyd. The\r\npaleontological evidence suggests that the deposits in question are not\r\npreglacial, but may be equivalent to the Pleistocene deposits of our\r\nriver-valleys.\"[DE]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DE: H. B. Woodward's Geology of England and Wales, pp. 543, 544]\r\n\r\nIf the views of Professor Lewis and Mr. Kendall are correct concerning\r\nthe unity of the Glacial period in England, the shelly and sandy deposits\r\nconnected with these Clwydian caves at an elevation of 400 feet or more\r\nwould be explained in connection with the marginal lakes which must\r\nhave occupied the valley during both the advance and the retreat of\r\nthe ice-front; the shells having been carried up from the sea-bottom\r\nby the ice-movement, after the manner supposed in the case of those at\r\nMacclesfield and Moel Tryfaen. If, therefore, the statements concerning\r\nthe discovery of flint implements in this Cae Gwyn cave can be relied\r\nupon, this is the most direct evidence yet obtained in Europe of man's\r\noccupation of the island during the continuance of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\nIn all these caves it is to be noted that there is a sharp line of\r\ndemarcation between the strata containing palæolithic implements and\r\nthose containing only the remains of modern animals. Palæolithic\r\nimplements are confined to the lower strata, which in some of the caves\r\nare separated from the upper by a continuous bed of stalagmite, to which\r\nreference will be made when discussing the chronology of the Glacial\r\nperiod. The remains of extinct animals also are confined to the lower\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nThe caves which we have been considering in England are all in limestone\r\nstrata, and have been formed by streams of water which have enlarged some\r\nnatural fissures both by mechanical action in wearing away the rocks, and\r\nby chemical action in dissolving them. Through the lowering of the main\r\nline of drainage, caverns with a dry floor are at length left, offering\r\nshelter and protection both to man and beast. Oftentimes, but not always,\r\nsome idea of the age of these caverns may be obtained by observing the\r\ndepth to which the main channel of drainage to which they were tributary\r\nhas been lowered since their formation. But to this subject also we will\r\nreturn when we come specifically to discuss the chronological question.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Continent._\r\n\r\nSystematic explorations in the caves of Belgium were begun in 1833 by\r\nDr. Schmerling, in the valley of the Meuse, near his residence in Liége.\r\nThe Meuse is here bordered by limestone precipices 200 or more feet in\r\nheight. Opening out from these rocky walls are the entrances to the\r\nnumerous caverns which have rendered the region so famous. To get access\r\nto the most important of these, Dr. Schmerling had to let himself down\r\nover a precipice by a rope tied to a tree, and then to creep along on\r\nall-fours through intricate channels to reach the larger chambers which\r\nit was his object to explore. In the cave at Engis, on the left bank of\r\nthe Meuse, about eight miles above Liége, he found a human skull deeply\r\nburied in breccia in company with many bones of the extinct animals\r\npreviously stated to have been associated with man during the Glacial\r\nperiod. This so-called \"Engis skull\" was by no means apelike in its\r\ncharacter, but closely resembled that of the average Caucasian man. But\r\nthis established the association upon the Continent of man with some of\r\nthe extinct animals of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Engis skull, reduced (after Lyell.)]\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of Liége has also furnished us another cavern whose\r\ncontents are of the highest importance, ranking indeed as perhaps the\r\nmost significant single discovery yet made. The cave referred to is\r\non the property of the Count of Beauffort, in the commune of Spy, in\r\nthe province of Namur in Belgium. For the facts relating to it we are\r\nindebted to Messrs: Lohest and Fraipont, the former Professor of Geology\r\nand the latter of Anatomy in the University of Liége. The exploration\r\nof the cave was made in 1886, and the full report with illustrations\r\npublished in the following year in Archives de Biologie.[DF] The\r\nsignificance of this discovery is enhanced by the light it sheds upon and\r\nthe confirmation it brings to the famous Neanderthal skull and others of\r\nsimilar character, which for a long time had been subjects of vigorous\r\ndiscussion. Before describing it, therefore, we will give a brief account\r\nof the previous discoveries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DF: See pp. 587, 757.]\r\n\r\nThe famous Neanderthal skull was brought to light in 1857 by workmen in a\r\nlimestone-quarry, near Düsseldorf, in the valley of the Neander, a small\r\ntributary to the Rhine. By these workmen a cavern was opened upon the\r\nsouthern side of the winding ravine, about sixty feet above the stream\r\nand one hundred feet below the top of the cliff. The skull attracted much\r\nattention from its supposed possession of many apelike characteristics;\r\nindeed, it was represented by some to be a real intermediate link between\r\nman and the anthropoid apes. The accompanying cut enables one to compare\r\nthe outline of the Neanderthal skull with that of a chimpanzee on the\r\none hand and of the highly developed European on the other. The apelike\r\npeculiarities of this skull appear in its vertical depression, in the\r\nenormous thickness of the bony ridges just above the eyes, and in the\r\ngradual slope of the back part of the head, together with some other\r\ncharacteristics which can only be described in technical language; so\r\nthat it was pronounced by the highest authorities the most apelike of\r\nhuman crania which had yet been discovered. Unfortunately, the jaw was\r\nnot found. The capacity of the skull, however, was seventy-five cubic\r\ninches, which is far above that of the highest of the apes, being indeed\r\nequal to the average capacity of Polynesian and Hottentot skulls.[DG]\r\nHuxley well remarks that \"so large a mass of brain as this would alone\r\nsuggest that the pithecoid tendencies indicated by this skull did not\r\nextend deep into the organization.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote DG: Huxley's Man's Place in Nature, p. 181.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Comparison of forms of skulls: _a_, European;\r\n_b_, the Neanderthal man; c, a chimpanzee (after Lyell).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.--Skull of the Man of Spy. (From photograph.)]\r\n\r\nUpon extending inquiries, it was found that the Neanderthal type of\r\nskull is one which still has representatives in all nations; so that it\r\nis unsafe to infer that the individual was a representative of all the\r\nindividuals living in his time. The skull of Bruce, the celebrated Scotch\r\nhero, was a close reproduction of the Neanderthal type; while, according\r\nto Quatrefages,[DH] the skull of the Bishop of Toul in the fourth century\r\n\"even exaggerates some of the most striking features of the Neanderthal\r\ncranium. The forehead is still more receding, the vault more depressed,\r\nand the head so long that the cephalic index is 69-41.\" The discovery of\r\nMessrs. Fraipont and Lohest adds much to our definite knowledge of the\r\nNeanderthal type of man, since the Belgic specimens are far more complete\r\nthan any others heretofore found, there being in their collection two\r\nskulls, together with the jawbones and most of the other parts of the\r\nframe. In this case also there is no suspicion that the deposits had been\r\ndisturbed, so as to admit any intrusion of human relics into the company\r\nof relics of an earlier age. According to M, Lohest, there were three\r\ndistinct ossiferous beds, separated by layers of stalagmite. All the\r\nossiferous beds contained the remains of the mammoth, but in the upper\r\nstratum they were few, and probably intrusive. The implements found in\r\nthis were also of a more modern type. In the second stratum from the top\r\nnumerous hearths were found with burnt wood and ashes, together with the\r\nbones of the rhinoceros, the horse, the mammoth, the cave-bear, and the\r\ncave-hyena, all of which were abundant, while there were also specimens\r\nof the Irish elk, the reindeer, the bison, the cave-lion, and several\r\nother species. In this layer also there were numerous implements of\r\nivory, together with ornaments and some faint indications of carving upon\r\nthe rib of a mammoth, besides a few fragments of pottery.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DH: Human Species, p. 310,]\r\n\r\nIt was in the third, or lowest, of these beds that the skeletons\r\nwere found. Here they were associated with abundant remains of the\r\nrhinoceros, the horse, the bison, the mastodon, the cave-hyena, and a\r\nfew other extinct species. Flint implements also, of the \"Mousterien\"\r\npattern (which, according to the opinion of the French archæologists, is\r\ncharacteristic of middle palæolithic times), were abundant Neither of the\r\nskeletons was complete, but they were sufficiently so to give an adequate\r\nidea of the type to which they belong, and one of the skulls is nearly\r\nperfect. According to M. Fraipont, \"one of these skulls is apparently\r\nthat of an old woman, the other that of a middle-aged man. They are both\r\nvery thick; the former is clearly dolichocephalic (long-headed, index\r\n70), the other less so. Both have very prominent eyebrows and large\r\norbits, with low, retreating foreheads, excessively so in the woman. The\r\nlower jaws are heavy. The older has almost no projecting chin. The teeth\r\nare large, and the last molar is as large as the others. These points\r\nare characteristic of an inferior and the oldest-known race. The bones\r\nindicate, like those of the Neanderthal and Naulette specimens, small,\r\nsquare-shouldered individuals.\" They were \"powerfully built, with strong,\r\ncuriously curved thigh-bones, the lower ends of which are so fashioned\r\nthat they must have walked with a bend at the knees.\"[DI]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DI: Huxley, Nineteenth Century, vol. xxviii (November, 1890),\r\np. 774.]\r\n\r\nOther crania from various Quaternary deposits in Europe seem to warrant\r\nthe inference that this type of man was the prevalent one during the\r\nearly part of the Palæolithic age. As long ago as 1700 a skull of\r\nthis type was exhumed in Canstadt, a village in the neighbourhood\r\nof Stuttgart, in Würtemberg. This was found in coexistence with the\r\nextinct animals whose bones we have described as so often appearing in\r\nthe high-level river-gravel of the Glacial age. But the importance of\r\nthe discovery at Canstadt was not appreciated until about the middle\r\nof the present century. From the priority of the discovery, and of the\r\ndiscussion among German anthropologists concerning it, it has been\r\nthought proper, however, by some to give the name of this village to the\r\nrace and call it the \"Canstadt race.\" But, whatever name prevails, it\r\nis important in our reading to keep in mind that the man of Canstadt,\r\nthe man of Neanderthal, and the man of Spy are identical in type, and\r\nprobably in age. Similar discoveries have been made in various other\r\nplaces. Among these are a lower jaw of the same type discovered in 1865\r\nby M. Dupont, at Naulette, in the valley of the Lesse, in Belgium, and\r\nassociated with the remains of extinct animals; a jawbone found in a\r\ngrotto at Arcy; a fragment of a skull found in 1865 by Faudel, in the\r\nloess of Eguisheim, near Colmar; a skull at Olmo, discovered in 1863, in\r\na compact clayey deposit forty-five feet below the surface; and a skull\r\ndiscovered in 1884 at Marcilly.\r\n\r\nM. Dupont has brought to light much additional testimony to glacial man\r\nfrom other caves in different parts of Belgium. In all he has explored as\r\nmany as sixty. Three of these, in the valley of the Montaigle, situated\r\nabout one hundred feet above the river, contained both remains of man\r\nand many bones of the mammoth and other associated animals, which had\r\nevidently been brought in for food.\r\n\r\nIn the hilly parts of Germany, also, and in Hungary, and even in the\r\nUral Mountains in Russia, and in one of the provinces of Siberia, the\r\nremains of the rhinoceros, and most of the other animals associated with\r\nman in glacial times, have been found in the cave deposits which have\r\nbeen examined. Though it can not be directly proved that these animals\r\nwere associated with man in any of these places, still it is interesting\r\nto see how wide-spread the animals were in northern Europe and Asia\r\nduring the Glacial period.\r\n\r\nSome northern animals, also, spread at this time into southern\r\nEurope--remains of the reindeer having been discovered on the south slope\r\nof the Pyrenees, but the remains of the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros,\r\nand the musk ox, have not been found so far south.\r\n\r\nAfrican species of the elephant, however, seem at one time to have had\r\nfree range throughout Spain, and the hippopotamus roamed in vast herds\r\nover the valleys of Sicily, while several species of pygmy elephants seem\r\nto be peculiar to the island of Malta.\r\n\r\nIn the case of all the cave deposits referred to (with possibly the\r\nexception of those of Victoria, England, and Cae Gwyn, Wales), the\r\nevidence of man's existence during the Glacial period is inferential,\r\nand consists largely in the fact that he was associated with various\r\nextinct animals which did not long survive that period, or with animals\r\nthat have since retired from Europe to their natural habitat in\r\nmountain-heights or high latitudes. The men whose remains are found in\r\nthe high-level river-drift, and in the caverns described, were evidently\r\nnot in possession of domestic animals, as their bones are conspicuous for\r\ntheir absence in all these places. The horse, which would seem to be an\r\nexception, was doubtless used for food, and not for service.\r\n\r\nIf we were writing upon the general subject of the antiquity and\r\ndevelopment of the human race, we should speak here in detail of several\r\nother caves and rock shelters in France and southern Europe, where\r\nremains of man belonging to an earlier period have been found. We should\r\nmention the rock shelter of Cro-Magnon in the valley of Vezère, as well\r\nas that of Mentone, where entire human skeletons were found. But it is\r\ndoubtful if these and other remains from caves which might be mentioned\r\nbelong in any proper sense to the Glacial period. The same remarks should\r\nbe made also with reference to the lake-dwellings in Switzerland, of\r\nwhich so much has been written in late years. All these belong to a much\r\nlater age than the river-drift man of whom we are speaking, and of whom\r\nwe have such abundant evidence both in Europe and in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.--Tooth of Machairodus neogæus, × 1/6 (drawn from a\r\ncast).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--Perfect tooth of an Elephas, found in Stanislaus\r\nCounty, California, 1/8 natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extinct Animals associated with Man during the Glacial Period._\r\n\r\nThis is the proper place in which to speak more fully of the extinct\r\nanimals which accompanied man in his earliest occupation of Europe and\r\nAmerica, and whose remains are so abundant in the river-drift gravel and\r\nin the caves of England, in connection with the relics of man. Among\r\nthese animals are\r\n\r\nThe Lion, which is now confined, to Africa and the warmer portions of\r\nAsia. But in glacial times a large species of this genus ranged over\r\nEurope from Sicily to central England.\r\n\r\nThe saber-toothed Tiger, with tusks ten inches long: (Machairodus\r\nlatidens), is now extinct. This species was in existence during the\r\nlatter part of the Tertiary period, but continued on until after man's\r\nappearance in the Glacial period. The presence of this animal would seem\r\nto indicate a warm climate.\r\n\r\nThe Leopard (_Felis pardus_) is now confined to Africa and southern Asia,\r\nand the larger islands adjoining; but during man's occupation of Europe\r\nin the Glacial epoch he was evidently haunted at every step by this\r\nanimal; for his bones are found as far north in England as palæolithic\r\nman is known to have ranged.\r\n\r\nThe Hyena. Two species of this animal are found in the bone-caves of\r\nEurope. During the Glacial epoch they ranged as far up as northern\r\nEngland, but they are now limited to Africa and southwestern Asia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Skull of _Hyena spelæa_, × 1/4.]\r\n\r\nThe Elephant is represented in the Preglacial and Glacial epochs by\r\nseveral species, some of which ranged as far north as Siberia. The\r\nAfrican elephant is not now found north of the Pyrenees and the Alps.\r\nBut a species of dwarf elephant, but four or five feet in height,\r\nhas already been referred to as having occupied Malta and Sicily; and\r\nstill another species has been found in Malta, whose average height\r\nwas less than three feet. An extinct species (Elephas antiquus), whose\r\nremains are found in the river-drift and in the lower strata of sediment\r\nin many caverns as far north as Yorkshire, England, was of unusual\r\nsize, and during the Glacial period was found on both sides of the\r\nMediterranean. But the species most frequently met with in palæolithic\r\ntimes was the mammoth (_Elephas primigenius_). This animal, now extinct,\r\naccompanied man in nearly every portion both of Europe and North America,\r\nand lingered far down into post-glacial times before becoming extinct.\r\nThis animal was nearly twice the weight of the modern elephant, and one\r\nthird taller. Occasionally his tusks were more than twelve feet long,\r\nand curved upward in a circle. It is the carcasses of this animal which\r\nhave been found in the frozen soil of Siberia and Alaska. It had a thick\r\ncovering of long, black hair, with a dense matting of reddish wool at the\r\nroots. During the Glacial period these animals must have roamed in vast\r\nherds over the plains of northern France and southern England, and the\r\nnorthern half of North America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.--Celebrated skeleton of mammoth, in St.\r\nPetersburg museum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--Molar tooth of mammoth (_Elephas primigenius_):\r\n_a_, grinding surface; _b_, side view.]\r\n\r\nThe Hippopotamus is at present a familiar animal in the larger rivers\r\nof Africa, but is not now found in Europe. During the Glacial period,\r\nhowever, he ranged as far north as Yorkshire, England, and his remains\r\nwere found in close association with those of man, both in Europe and on\r\nthe Pacific coast in America. Twenty tons of their bones have been taken\r\nfrom a single cave in Sicily.[DJ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DJ: Prestwich's Geology, vol. ii, p. 508.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--Tooth of _Mastodon Americanus_.]\r\n\r\nThe mammoth and the rhinoceros we know to have been adapted to cold\r\nclimates by the possession of long hair and thick fur, but the\r\nhippopotamus by its love for water would seem to be precluded from the\r\npossession of this protective covering. It is suggested, however, by\r\nSir William Dawson, that he may have been adapted to arctic climates by\r\na fatty covering, as the walrus is at the present time. A difficulty in\r\naccounting for many of the remains of the hippopotamus in some of the\r\nEnglish caverns is that they are so far away from present or possible\r\nwater-courses. But it would seem that due credit has not been ordinarily\r\ngiven to the migratory instincts of the animal. In southern Africa they\r\nare known to \"travel speedily for miles over land from one pool of a\r\ndried-up river to another; but it is by water that their powers of\r\nlocomotion are surpassingly great, not only in rivers, but in the sea....\r\nThe geologist, therefore, may freely speculate on the time when herds\r\nof hippopotami issued from North African rivers, such as the Nile, and\r\nswam northward in summer along the coasts of the Mediterranean, or even\r\noccasionally visited islands near the shore. Here and there they may have\r\nlanded to graze or browse, tarrying awhile, and afterwards continuing\r\ntheir course northward. Others may have swum in a few summer days from\r\nrivers in the south of Spain or France to the Somme, Thames, or Severn,\r\nmaking timely retreat to the south before the snow and ice set in.\"[DK]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DK: Lyell, Antiquity of Man, p. 180,]\r\n\r\nThe Mastodon (_Mastodon Americanus_), (Fig. 88), \"is probably the largest\r\nland mammal known, unless we except the Dinotherium. It was twelve to\r\nthirteen feet high, and, including the tusks, twenty-four to twenty-five\r\nfeet long. It differed from the elephant chiefly in the character of its\r\nteeth. The difference is seen in Figs. 86 and 87. The elephant's tooth\r\ngiven above (Fig. 86) is sixteen inches long, and the grinding surface\r\neight inches by four.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.--_Mastodon Americanus_ (after Owen).]\r\n\r\nThe mastodon, together with the mammoth, made their appearance about\r\nthe middle of the Miocene epoch. At the close of the Tertiary period\r\nthe mastodon became extinct on the Eastern Continent, but continued in\r\nNorth America to be a companion of man well on toward the close of the\r\nGlacial period. Many perfect skeletons have been found in the deposits\r\nof this period in North America. \"One magnificent specimen was found in\r\na marsh near Newburg, New York, with its legs bent under the body, and\r\nthe head thrown up, evidently in the very position in which it mired. The\r\nteeth were still filled with the half-chewed remnants of its food, which\r\nconsisted of twigs of spruce, fir, and other trees; and within the ribs,\r\nin the place where the stomach had been, a large quantity of similar\r\nmaterial was found.\"[DL]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DL: Le Conte's Geology (edition of 1891), p. 582.]\r\n\r\nThe Rhinoceros is now confined to Africa and southern Asia; but the\r\nremains of four species have been found in America, Europe, and northern\r\nAsia, in deposits of the Glacial period. In company with that of the\r\nmammoth, already spoken of, a carcass of the woolly rhinoceros was found\r\nin 1771 in the frozen soil of northern Siberia. The bones of other\r\nspecies have been found as far north as Yorkshire, England. In the valley\r\nof the Somme there was found \"the whole hind limb of a rhinoceros, the\r\nbones of which were still in their true relative position. They must\r\nhave been joined together by ligaments and even surrounded by muscles\r\nat the time of their interment.\" An entire skeleton was found near by.\r\nThe gravel terrace in which these occurred is about forty feet above the\r\nfloor of the valley, and must have been formed subsequent to some of the\r\nstrata which contained the remains of human art. In America the bones are\r\nfound in the gold-bearing gravels of California, in connection with human\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--Skeleton of _Rhinoceros tichorhinus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--Skull of cave-bear (_Ursus spelæus_),]\r\n\r\nThe Bear was represented in Europe in palæolithic times by three species,\r\nof which only one exists there at the present time. But during the\r\nGlacial period the grizzly bear, now confined to the western part of\r\nAmerica, and the extinct cave-bear were companions, or enemies as the\r\ncase may be, of man throughout Europe. The cave-bear was of large size,\r\nand his bones occur almost everywhere in the lower strata of sediment in\r\nthe caves of England.\r\n\r\nThe Great Irish Elk, or deer, is now extinct, though it is supposed by\r\nsome to have lingered until historic times. Its remains are found widely\r\ndistributed over middle Europe in deposits of palæolithic age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.--Skeleton of the Irish elk (_Cervus megaceros_).]\r\n\r\nThe Horse was also, as we have seen, a very constant associate of man\r\nin middle Europe during the Palæolithic age, but probably not as a\r\ndomesticated animal. The evidence is pretty conclusive that he was\r\nprized chiefly for food. About some of the caves in France such immense\r\nquantities of their bones are found that they can be accounted for best\r\nas refuse-heaps into which the useless bones had been thrown after their\r\nfeasts, after the manner of the disposal of shells of shell-fish. In\r\nAmerica the horses associated with man were probably of a species now\r\nextinct. The skull of one (_Equus excelsus_) recently found in Texas, in\r\nPleistocene deposits, associated with human implements, is, according\r\nto Cope, intermediate in character between the horse and quagga.[DM]\r\nThe frontal bone was crushed in in a manner to suggest that it had been\r\nknocked in the head with a stone hammer, such as was found in the same\r\nbed. Possibly, therefore, man's love of horse-flesh may have been an\r\nimportant element in securing the extinction of the species in America.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DM: American Naturalist, vol. xxv (October, 1891), p. 912.]\r\n\r\nBesides these animals there were associated with man at this time the\r\nMusk Sheep and the Reindeer, both now confined to the regions of the far\r\nnorth, but during the Glacial period ranging into southern France, and\r\nmingling their bones with those both of man and of the southern species\r\nalready enumerated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--Musk-sheep (_Ovibos moschatius_).]\r\n\r\nThe Wolverine, the Arctic Fox, the Marmot, the Lemming--all now confined\r\nto colder regions--at that time mingled on the plains of central Europe\r\nwith the species mentioned as belonging now to Africa and southern Asia.\r\nThe Ibex, also, and the Snowy Vole and Chamois descended to the plains\r\nfrom their mountain-heights, and joined in the strange companionship of\r\nanimals from the north and from the south.\r\n\r\nBesides these extremes there were associated with man during the Glacial\r\nperiod numerous representatives of the temperate group of existing\r\nanimals, such as the bison, the horse, the stag, the beaver, the hare,\r\nthe rabbit, the otter, the weasel, the wild-cat, the fox, the wolf, the\r\nwild boar, and the brown bear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--Reindeer.]\r\n\r\nTo account for this strange intermingling of arctic and torrid species\r\nof animals, especially in Europe, during man's occupancy of the region\r\nin glacial times, various theories have been resorted to, but none of\r\nthem can be said to be altogether satisfactory. One hypothesis is that\r\nthe bones of these diverse animals became mingled by reason of the great\r\nrange of the annual migration of the species. The reindeer, for example,\r\nstill performs extensive annual migrations. In summer it ventures far out\r\nupon the _tundras_ of North America and Siberia to feed upon the abundant\r\nvegetation that springs up like magic under the influence of the long\r\ndays of sunshine; while, as winter approaches, it returns to the forests\r\nof the interior. Or in other places this animal and his associates,\r\nlike birds of passage, move northward in summer to escape the heat, and\r\nsouthward in the winter to escape the extreme cold. Many of the other\r\nanimals also are more or less migratory in their habits.\r\n\r\nThus it is thought that during the Glacial period, when man occupied\r\nnorthern France and southern England, the reindeer, the musk sheep, the\r\narctic fox, and perhaps the hippopotamus and some other animals, annually\r\nvibrated between northern England and southern France, a slight elevation\r\nof the region furnishing a land passage from England to the continent;\r\nwhile the chamois and other Alpine species vibrated as regularly between\r\nthe valleys in winter and the mountain-heights in summer. The habits of\r\nthese species are such that it is not difficult to see how in their case\r\nthis migration could have taken place.\r\n\r\nProfessor Boyd Dawkins attempts to reduce the difficulty by supposing\r\nthat the Glacial epoch was marked by the occurrence of minor periods of\r\nclimatic variation, during which, in comparatively short periods, the\r\nisothermal lines vibrated from north to south, and _vice versa_. In this\r\nview the southern species gradually crowded upon the northern during\r\nthe periods of climatic amelioration, until they reached their limit in\r\ncentral England, and then in turn, as the climate became more rigorous,\r\nslowly retreated before the pressure of their northern competitors.\r\nMeanwhile the hyena sallied forth from his various caves, over this\r\nregion, at one time of the year to feed upon the reindeer, and at another\r\ntime of the year upon the flesh of the hippopotamus, in both cases\r\ndragging their bones with him to his sheltered retreat in the limestone\r\ncaverns[DN] which he shared at intervals with palæolithic man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DN: Early Man in Britain, p. 114.]\r\n\r\nThe theory of Mr. James Geikie is that the period, while one of great\r\nprecipitation, was characterised by a climate of comparatively even\r\ntemperature, in which there was not so great a difference as now between\r\nthe winters and the summers, the winters not being so cold and the\r\nsummers not so hot as at present. This is substantially the condition of\r\nthings in southern Alaska at the present time, where extensive glaciers\r\ncome down to the sea-level, even though the thermometer at Sitka rarely\r\ngoes below zero (Fahrenheit). It is, therefore, easy to conceive that if\r\nthere were extensive plains bordering the Alaskan archipelago, so as to\r\nfurnish ranging grounds for more southern species, the animals of the\r\nnorth and the animals of the south might partially occupy the same belt\r\nof territory, and their bones become mingled in the same river deposits.\r\n\r\nIn order to clear the way for either of these hypotheses to account\r\nfor the mingling of arctic and torrid species characteristic of the\r\nperiod under consideration in Europe, we must probably suppose such an\r\nelevation of the region to the south as to afford land connection between\r\nEurope and Africa. This would be furnished by only a moderate amount of\r\nelevation across the Strait of Gibraltar and from the south of Italy to\r\nthe opposite shore in Africa; and there are many indications, in the\r\ndistribution of species, of the existence in late geological times of\r\nsuch connection.\r\n\r\nIt should also be observed that the present capacities and habits of\r\nspecies are not a certain criterion of their past habits and capacities.\r\nAs already remarked, both the rhinoceros and the mammoth of glacial\r\ntimes were probably furnished with a woolly protection, which enabled\r\nthem to endure more cold than their present descendants could do, while\r\nthe elephant is even now known to be able to endure the rigors of the\r\nclimate at great elevations upon the Himalaya Mountains. We can easily\r\nimagine these species to have been adjusted to quite different climatic\r\nconditions from those which now seem necessary to their existence. In\r\nthe case of the hippopotamus, also, it is quite possible, as already\r\nsuggested, that it is more inclined to migration than is generally\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nGeikie's theory of the prevalence of an equable climate during a portion\r\nof the Glacial period in Europe is thought to be further sustained\r\nby the character of the vegetation which then covered the region, as\r\nwell as by the remains of the mollusks which occupied the waters. Then\r\n\"temperate and southern species like the ash, the poplar, the sycamore,\r\nthe fig-tree, the Judas-tree, the laurel, etc., overspread all the low\r\nground of France, as far north at least as Paris.... It was under such\r\nconditions,\" continues Geikie, \"that the elephants, rhinoceroses, and\r\nhippopotamuses, and the vast herds of temperate cervine and bovine\r\nspecies ranged over Europe, from the shores of the Mediterranean up to\r\nthe latitude of Yorkshire, and probably even farther north still; and\r\nfrom the borders of Asia to the Western Ocean. Despite the presence of\r\nnumerous fierce carnivora--lions, hyenas, tigers, and others--Europe at\r\nthat time, with its shady forests, its laurel-margined streams, its broad\r\nand deep-flowing rivers, a country in every way suited to the needs of a\r\nrace of hunters and fishers--must have been no unpleasant habitation for\r\npalæolithic man.\r\n\r\n\"This, however, is only one side of the picture. There was a time when\r\nthe climate of Pleistocene Europe presented the strongest contrast to\r\nthose genial conditions--a time when the dwarf birch of the Scottish\r\nHighlands, and the arctic willow, with their northern congeners, grew\r\nupon the low grounds of middle Europe. Arctic animals, such as the musk\r\nsheep and the reindeer, lived then, all the year round, in the south of\r\nFrance; the mammoth ranged into Spain and Italy; the glutton descended to\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean; the marmot came down to the low grounds\r\nat the foot of the Apennines; and the lagomys inhabited the low-lying\r\nmaritime districts of Corsica and Sardinia. The land and fresh-water\r\nshells of many Pleistocene deposits tell a similar tale; boreal, high\r\nalpine, and hyperborean forms are characteristic of these accumulations\r\nin central Europe; even in the southern regions of our continent the\r\nshells testify to a former colder and wetter climate.\"[DO]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DO: Prehistoric Europe, p. 67.]\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Geikie's view these facts indicate two Glacial periods, with an\r\nintervening epoch of mild climate. In the opinion of others they are\r\nreadily explainable by the coming on and departure of a single Ice age,\r\nwith its various minor episodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earliest Remains of Man on the Pacific Coast of North America._\r\n\r\nMost interesting evidence concerning the antiquity of man in America,\r\nand his relation to the Glacial period, has come from the Pacific coast.\r\nDuring the height of the mining activity in California, from 1850 to\r\n1860, numerous reports were rife that human remains had been discovered\r\nin the gold-bearing gravel upon the flanks of the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains. These reports did not attract much scientific attention until\r\nthey came to relate to the gravel deposits found deeply buried beneath\r\na flow of lava locally known as the Sonora or Tuolumne Table Mountain.\r\nThis lava issued from a vent near the summit of the mountain-range, and\r\nflowed down the valley of the Stanislaus River for a distance of fifty or\r\nsixty miles, burying everything in the valley beneath it, and compelling\r\nthe river to seek another channel. The thickness of the lava averages\r\nabout one hundred feet, and so long a time has elapsed since the eruption\r\nthat the softer strata on either side of the valley down which it flowed\r\nhave been worn away to such an extent that the lava now rises nearly\r\neverywhere above the general level, and has become a striking feature in\r\nthe landscape, stretching for many miles as a flat-topped ridge about\r\nhalf a mile in width, and presenting upon the sides a perpendicular face\r\nof solid basalt for a considerable distance near the lower end of the\r\nflow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--Section across Table Mountain, Tuolumne County,\r\nCalifornia: _L_, lava; _G_, gravel; _S_, slate; _R_, old river-bed; _R'_,\r\npresent river-bed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--Calaveras Skull. (From Whitney.)]\r\n\r\nIt was under this mountain of lava that the numerous implements and\r\nremains of man occurred which were reported to Professor J. D. Whitney\r\nwhen he was conducting the geological survey of California between 1860\r\nand 1870. The implements consisted of stone mortars and pestles, suitable\r\nfor use in grinding acorns and other coarse articles of food. There were,\r\nhowever, some rude articles of ornament. In one of the mining shafts\r\npenetrating the gravel underneath Table Mountain, near Sonora, there was\r\nreported to have been discovered, in 1857, a human jawbone, one portion\r\nof which was sent by responsible parties to the Boston Society of Natural\r\nHistory, and another part to the Philadelphia Academy of Sciences, in\r\nwhose collections the fragments can now be seen.\r\n\r\nInterest reached a still higher pitch when, in 1860, an entire human\r\nskull with some other human bones was reported to have been discovered\r\nunder this same lava deposit, a few miles from Sonora, at Altaville, in\r\nCalaveras County, and hence known as the \"Calaveras skull.\" Persistent\r\nefforts were made soon after to discredit the genuineness of this\r\ndiscovery. Bret Harte showered upon it the shafts of his ridicule, and\r\nvarious other persons gave currency to the story that the whole report\r\noriginated in a joke played by the miners upon unsuspecting geologists.\r\nThese attacks were so successful that many conservative archæologists and\r\nmen of science have refused to accept the skull as genuine.\r\n\r\nRecent events, however, have brought such additional evidence[DP] to the\r\nsupport of this discovery that it would seem unreasonable any longer to\r\nrefuse to credit the testimony. At the meeting of the Geological Society\r\nof America, at Washington, in January, 1891, Mr. George P. Becker, of\r\nthe United States Geological Survey, who for some years has had charge\r\nof investigations relating to the gold-bearing gravels of the Pacific\r\ncoast, presented the affidavit of Mr. J. H. Neale, a well-known mining\r\nengineer of unquestionable character, stating that he had taken a stone\r\nmortar and pestle, together with some spear-heads (which through Mr.\r\nBecker he presented to the Society), from undisturbed strata of gravel\r\nunderneath the lava of Table Mountain, near Rawhide Gulch, a few miles\r\nfrom Sonora. At the same meeting Mr. Becker presented a pestle which\r\nMr. Clarence King, the first director of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey, took with his own hands out of undisturbed gravel under this same\r\nlava deposit, near Tuttletown, a mile or two from the preceding locality\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DP: See Bulletin Geological Society of America, 1891, pp.\r\n189-200.]\r\n\r\nI was so fortunate, also, as to be able to report to the Society at the\r\nsame meeting the discovery, in 1887, of a small stone mortar by Mr. C.\r\nMcTarnahan, the assistant surveyor of Tuolumne County. This mortar was\r\nfound by Mr. McTarnahan in the Empire mine, which penetrates the gravel\r\nunderneath Table Mountain, about three miles from Sonora, and not far\r\nfrom the other localities above mentioned. The place where the mortar was\r\nfound is about one hundred and seventy-five feet in from the edge of the\r\nsuperincumbent lava, which is here about one hundred feet in thickness.\r\nAt my request, this mortar was presented by its owner, Mrs. M. J. Darwin,\r\nto the Western Reserve Historical Society of Cleveland, Ohio, in whose\r\ncollection it can now be seen.\r\n\r\nThese three independent instances, each of them authenticated by the best\r\nof evidence, have such cumulative force that probably few men of science\r\nwill longer stand out against it.\r\n\r\nAssociated with these discoveries, there is to be mentioned another,\r\nwhich was brought to my notice by Mr. Charles Francis Adams in October,\r\n1889.[DQ] This was a miniature clay image of a female form, about one\r\ninch and a half in length, and beautifully formed, which was found, in\r\nAugust, 1889, by Mr. M. A. Kurtz, while boring an artesian well at Nampa,\r\nAda County, Idaho. The strata passed through included, near the surface,\r\nfifteen feet of lava. Underneath this, alternating beds of clay and\r\nquicksand occurred to a depth of three hundred and twenty feet, where\r\nthere appeared indications of a former surface soil lying just above the\r\nbed-rock, from which the clay image was brought up in the sand-pump.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DQ: See Proceedings Boston Society Natural History, January,\r\n1890, and February, 1891.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96.--Three views of Nampa image drawn to scale. The\r\nmiddle one is from a photograph.]\r\n\r\nI devoted the summer of 1890 to a careful study of the lava deposits both\r\nin Idaho and in California, with a view to learning their significance\r\nwith reference to these discoveries. The main facts brought to light by\r\nthis investigation are that in the Snake River Valley, Idaho, there are\r\nnot far from twelve thousand square miles of territory covered with a\r\ncontinuous stratum of basaltic lava, extending nearly across the entire\r\ndiameter of the State from east to west. Nampa, where the miniature\r\nimage was discovered, is within five miles of the western limit of this\r\nlava-flow, and where it had greatly thinned out. The relative age of the\r\nlava is shown by its relation to Tertiary beds of shale and sandstone,\r\ncontaining numerous fossils of late Pliocene species. These are overlaid\r\nin this vicinity by the lava, thus determining its post-Tertiary\r\ncharacter. Examination with reference to the more precise determination\r\nof age reveals channels of erosion formed since the lava-flow took\r\nplace, which, when studied sufficiently, will probably lead to valuable\r\napproximate results. At present I can only say that the amount of\r\nerosion since the lava eruptions of western Idaho is not excessive, and\r\nvery likely may be brought within a period of from ten thousand to twenty\r\nthousand years. The enormous erosion in the cañon of the Snake River,\r\nnear Shoshone Falls, in central Idaho, is doubtless of a much earlier\r\ndate than that in the Boise River, near Nampa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97.--Map showing Pocatello, Nampa, and the valley of\r\nSnake River.]\r\n\r\nThe disturbances created in this part of the valley by the bursting of\r\nthe barriers between the glacial Lake Bonneville and the Snake River,\r\nalready described (see above, page 233), have not been worked out. There\r\ncan be no doubt, however, that interesting results will come to light\r\nin connection with the problem; for Pocatello, the point at which the\r\n_débâcle_ reached the Snake River plain, is about 2,000 feet higher than\r\nNampa, and 350 miles distant, and the water must have poured into the\r\nvalley faster than the river in its upper portion could have discharged\r\nit. By just what channels the mighty current worked down to the lower\r\nlevels on the western borders of the State it would be most interesting\r\nas well as instructive to know.\r\n\r\nA study of the situation in Tuolumne and Calaveras Counties, California,\r\nreveals a state of things closely resembling, in important respects,\r\nthat in western Idaho. At first sight the impression is made that an\r\nimmense lapse of time must have occurred since the volcanic eruption\r\nwhich furnished the lava of Table Mountain. The Stanislaus River flows\r\nin a channel of erosion a thousand feet or more lower than the ancient\r\nchannel filled by lava, and in two or three places cuts directly across\r\nit. An immense amount of time, also, would seem to be required to permit\r\nthe smaller local streams to have worn away so much of the sides of the\r\nancient valley as to allow the lava deposit now so continuously to rise\r\nabove the general surface. Still, the question of absolute time cannot\r\nbe considered separately without much further study. It is by no means\r\ncertain that, when the lava-stream poured down the mountain, it always\r\nfollowed the lowest depressions; but at certain points it may have been\r\ndammed up in its course by its own accumulations so as to be turned off\r\ninto what was then an ancient abandoned channel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98.--Section along the line, north and south:\r\n_r' r'_, old river-beds; _r r_, present river-beds; _L_, lava;\r\n_sl_, slate.]\r\n\r\nThe forms of animal and vegetable life with which the remains of man\r\nunder Table Mountain are associated, are, indeed, to a considerable\r\nextent, species now extinct in California, and some of them no longer\r\nexist anywhere in the world. But a suggestion of Professor Prestwich,\r\nin England, made with reference to the extinct forms of life associated\r\nwith human remains in the glacial deposits in Europe, is revived by\r\nMr. Becker, of the Geological Survey, with reference to the California\r\ndiscoveries; his inference being, not that man is so extremely ancient\r\nin California, but that many of these plants and animals have continued\r\nto a more recent date than has ordinarily been supposed.\r\n\r\nThe connection of these lava-flows on the Pacific coast with the Glacial\r\nperiod is unquestionably close. For some reason which we do not fully\r\nunderstand, the vast accumulation of ice in North America during the\r\nGlacial period is correlated with enormous eruptions of lava west of the\r\nRocky Mountains, and, in connection with these events, there took place\r\non the Pacific coast an almost entire change in the plants and animals\r\noccupying the region. Mr. Warren Upham is of the opinion that on the\r\nPacific coast they lingered much later than in the region east of the\r\nRocky Mountains. Indeed, it is pretty certain that not many centuries\r\nhave elapsed since the glacial phenomena of the Sierra Nevada Mountains\r\nwere much more pronounced than they are at the present time, and it is\r\nequally certain that there have been vast eruptions of lava in California\r\nwithin three hundred years.\r\n\r\nFrom these data, therefore, Mr. Becker has real foundation for his\r\nsuggestion that perhaps in the Glacial period California was a kind of\r\nhealth resort for Pliocene animals, as it is at the present time for man;\r\nor, at any rate, that the later date of the accumulations permitted the\r\nanimals to survive there much longer than in the region east of the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nFurther discussion of the preceding facts will profitably be deferred\r\nuntil, in the next two chapters, the questions of the cause and date of\r\nthe Glacial period have been considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn searching for the cause of the Glacial period, it is evident that we\r\nmust endeavor to find conditions which will secure over the centre of the\r\nglaciated area either a great increase of snow-fall or a great decrease\r\nin the mean annual temperature, or both of these conditions combined in\r\ngreater or less degree. As can be seen, both from the nature of the case\r\nand from the unglaciated condition of Siberia and northern Alaska, a low\r\ndegree of temperature is not sufficient to produce permanent ice-fields.\r\nIf the snow-fall is excessively meagre, even the small amount of heat in\r\nan arctic summer will be sufficient to melt it all away.\r\n\r\nFrom the condition of Greenland, however, it appears that a moderate\r\namount of precipitation where it is chiefly in the form of snow may\r\nproduce enormous glaciers if at the same time the average temperature\r\nis low. In southeastern Alaska, on the other hand, the glaciers are of\r\nenormous size, though the mean annual temperature is by no means low,\r\nfor there the great amount of snow-fall amply compensates for the higher\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nSnow stores the cold and keeps it in a definite place. If the air becomes\r\nchilled, circulation at once sets in, and the cold air is transferred to\r\nwarmer regions; but if there is moisture in the air, so that snow forms,\r\nthe cold becomes locked up, as it were, and falls to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe amount of cold thus locked up in snow is enormous. To melt one\r\ncubic foot of ice requires as much heat as would raise the temperature\r\nof a cubic foot of water 176° Fahrenheit. To melt a \"layer of ice only\r\none inch and a half thick would require as much heat as would raise a\r\nstratum of air eight hundred feet thick from the freezing-point to the\r\ntropical heat of 88° Fahrenheit.\" It is the slowness with which ice melts\r\nwhich enables it to accumulate as it does, both in winter and upon high\r\nmountains and in arctic regions. Captain Scoresby relates that when near\r\nthe north pole the sun would sometimes be so hot as to melt the pitch on\r\nthe south side of his vessel, while water was freezing on the north side,\r\nin the shade, owing to the cooling effect of the masses of ice with which\r\nhe was surrounded.\r\n\r\nThus it will appear that a change in the direction of the moist winds\r\nblowing from the equator towards the poles might produce a Glacial\r\nepoch. If snow falls upon the ocean it cools the water, but through the\r\ncurrents, everywhere visible in the sea, the temperature in the water in\r\nthe different parts soon becomes equalized. If, however, the snow falls\r\nupon the land, it must be melted by the direct action of the sun and\r\nwind upon the spot where it is. If the heat furnished by these agencies\r\nis not sufficient to do it year by year, there will soon be such an\r\naccumulation that glaciers will begin to form. It is clear, therefore,\r\nthat the conditions producing a Glacial period are likely to prove very\r\ncomplicated, and we need not be surprised if the conclusions to which we\r\ncome are incapable of demonstration.\r\n\r\nTheories respecting the cause of the Glacial period may be roughly\r\nclassified as astronomical and geological. Among the astronomical\r\ntheories, one which has sometimes been adduced is that the solar system\r\nin its movement through space is subjected to different degrees of heat\r\nat different times. According to this theory, the temperate climate\r\nwhich characterised the polar regions during the Tertiary period, and\r\ncontinued up to the beginning of the Glacial epoch, was produced by the\r\ninfluence of the warmer stretches of space through which the whole solar\r\nsystem was moving at that time; while the Glacial period resulted from\r\nthe influence upon the earth of the colder spaces through which the\r\nsystem subsequently moved.\r\n\r\nWhile it is impossible absolutely to disprove this hypothesis, it labors\r\nunder the difficulty of having little positive evidence in its favor,\r\nand thus contravenes a fundamental law of scientific reasoning, that we\r\nmust have a real cause upon which to rest our theories. In endeavouring\r\nto explain the unknown, we should have something known to start with.\r\nBut in this case we are not sure that there are any such variations in\r\nthe temperature of the space through which the solar system moves. This\r\ntheory, therefore, cannot come in for serious consideration until all\r\nothers have been absolutely disproved. As we shall also more fully see,\r\nin the subsequent discussion, the distribution of the ice during the\r\nGlacial period was not such as to indicate a gradual extension of it from\r\nthe north pole, but rather the accumulation upon centres many degrees to\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nClosely allied with the preceding theory is the supposition broached\r\nby some astronomers that the sun is a variable star, dependent to some\r\nextent for its heat upon the impact of meteorites, or to the varying\r\nrapidity with which the contraction of its volume is proceeding.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that when two solid bodies clash together, heat is\r\nproduced proportionate to the momentum of the two bodies. In other\r\nwords, the motion which is arrested is transformed into heat. Mr. Croll,\r\nin his last publication[DR] upon the subject, ingeniously attempted to\r\naccount for the gaseous condition of the nebulæ and the heat of the sun\r\nand other fixed stars by supposing it to be simply transformed motion.\r\nAccording to this theory, the original form of force imparted to the\r\nuniverse was that exerted in setting in motion innumerable dark bodies,\r\nwhich from time to time have collided with each other. The effects of\r\nsuch collisions would be to transform a large amount of motion into\r\nheat and its accompanying forms of molecular force. The violence of the\r\ncompact of two worlds would be so great as to break them up into the\r\noriginal atoms of which they are composed, and the heat set free would\r\nbe sufficient to keep the masses in a gaseous condition and cause them\r\nto swell out into enormous proportions. From that time on, as the heat\r\nradiated into space, there would be the gradual contraction which we\r\nsuppose is going on in all the central suns, accompanied, of course, with\r\na gradual decline of the heat-energy in the system.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DR: Stellar Evolution and its Relation to Geological Time.]\r\n\r\nNow, it is well known that the earth and the solar system in their\r\nonward progress pass through trains of meteorites. The tails of some of\r\nthe comets are indeed pretty clearly proved to be streams of ponderable\r\nmatter, through which, from time to time, the minor members of the solar\r\nsystem plunge, and receive some accession to their bulk and weight. The\r\nshooting-stars, which occasionally attract our attention in the sky,\r\nmark the course of such meteorites as they pass through the earth's\r\natmosphere, and are heated to a glow by the friction with it. It has been\r\nsuggested, therefore, that the sun itself may at times have its amount\r\nof heat sensibly affected by such showers of meteorites or asteroids.\r\nUpon this theory the warm period of the Tertiary epoch, for instance,\r\nmay have been due to the heat temporarily added to the sun by impact\r\nwith minor astronomical bodies. When, afterwards, it gradually cooled\r\ndown, receiving through a long period no more accessions of heat from\r\nthat source, the way was prepared for the colder epoch of the Glacial\r\nperiod, which, in turn, was dispelled by fresh showers of meteorites\r\nupon the sun, sufficient to produce the amelioration of climate which we\r\nexperience at the present time.\r\n\r\nAs intimated, this theory is closely allied to the preceding, the\r\nprincipal difference being that it limits the effects of the supposed\r\ncause to the solar system, and looks to our sun as the varying source of\r\nheat-supply. It has the advantage over that, however, of possessing a\r\nmore tangible _vera causa_. Meteorites, asteroids, and comets are known\r\nto be within this system, and have occasional collisions with other\r\nmembers of it. But the principal objection urged against the preceding\r\ntheory applies here, also, with equal force. The accumulations of ice\r\nduring the Glacial period were not determined by latitude. In North\r\nAmerica the centre of accumulation was south of the Arctic Circle--a fact\r\nwhich points clearly enough to some other cause than that of a general\r\nlowering of the temperature exterior to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe same objections would bear against the theory ably set forth by Mr.\r\nSereno E. Bishop, of Honolulu, which, in substance, is that there may\r\nbe considerable variability in the sun's emission of heat, owing to\r\nfluctuations in the rate of the shrinkage of its diameter, brought about\r\nby the unequal struggle between the diminishing amount of heat in the\r\ninterior and the increasing force of the gravitation of its particles,\r\nand by the changes in the enveloping atmosphere of the sun, which, like\r\nan enswathing blanket, arrests a large portion of the radiant heat from\r\nthe nucleus, and is itself evidently subject to violent movements, some\r\nof which seem to carry it down to the sun's interior. Unknown electrical\r\nforces, he thinks, may also combine to add an element of variability.\r\nThese supposed changes may be compared to those which take place upon\r\nthe surface of the earth when, at irregular intervals, immense sheets of\r\nlava, like those upon the Pacific coast of North America, are exuded in a\r\ncomparatively brief time, to be succeeded by a long period of rest. The\r\nheat thus brought to the surface of the earth would add perceptibly to\r\nthat radiated from it into space in ordinary times. Something similar to\r\nthis upon the sun, it is thought, might produce effects perceptible upon\r\nthe earth, and account for alternate periods of heat and cold.\r\n\r\nA fourth astronomical theory is that there has been a shifting of the\r\nearth's axis; that at the time of the Glacial period the north pole,\r\ninstead of being where it now is, was somewhere in the region of central\r\nGreenland. This attractive theory has been thought worthy of attention\r\nby President T. C. Chamberlin and by Professor G. C. Comstock,[DS] but\r\nit likewise labours under a twofold difficulty: First, the shifting of\r\nthe poles observed (450 feet per year) is too slight to have produced the\r\nchanges within any reasonable time, and it is not likely to have been\r\ncontinuous for a long period. But still more fatal to the theory is the\r\nfact that the warm climate preceding the Glacial period seems to have\r\nextended towards the present north pole upon every side; a temperate\r\nflora having been found in the fossil plants of the Tertiary beds in\r\nGreenland and northern British America, as well as upon Nova Zembla and\r\nSpitzbergen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DS: See papers by these gentlemen read at the meeting of the\r\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, in Washington, in\r\nAugust, 1891. Professor Comstock's paper appeared in the American Journal\r\nof Science for January, 1893.]\r\n\r\nA fifth astronomical theory, and one which has of late years been\r\nreceived with great favour, is that so ably advocated by the late Dr.\r\nJames Croll and by Professor James Geikie. Following the suggestions\r\nof the astronomer Adhémar, these writers have attempted to show that\r\nnot only one Glacial epoch, but a succession of such epochs, has been\r\nproduced in the world by the effect of the changes which are known to\r\nhave taken place in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit when combined\r\nwith the precession of the equinoxes--another calculable astronomical\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 99.--Diagram showing effect of precession: _A._\r\ncondition of things now; _B._ as it will be 10,500 years hence. The\r\neccentricity is of course greatly exaggerated.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the earth's orbit is elliptical; that is, it is\r\nlonger in one direction than in the other, so that the sun is one side\r\nof the centre. During the winter of the northern hemisphere the earth\r\nis now about three million miles nearer the sun than in the summer; but\r\nthe summer makes up for this distance by being about seven days longer\r\nthan the winter. Through the precession of the equinoxes this state of\r\nthings will be reversed in ten thousand five hundred years; at which time\r\nwe shall be nearer the sun during our northern summer, and farther away\r\nin winter, our winter then being also longer than our summer. Besides,\r\nthrough the unequal attraction of the planets the eccentricity of the\r\nearth's orbit periodically increases and diminishes, so that there have\r\nbeen periods when the earth was ten million five hundred thousand miles\r\nfarther from the sun in winter than in summer; at which times, also,\r\nthe winter was nearly twenty-eight days longer than the summer. Such an\r\nextreme elongation of the earth's orbit occurred about two hundred and\r\nfifty thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to assume that such a change in astronomical conditions would\r\nproduce great effects upon the earth's climate; and equally easy to\r\nconnect with those effects the vast extension of ice during the Glacial\r\nperiod. Since, also, this period of extreme eccentricity terminated\r\nonly eighty thousand years ago, the close of the Glacial period would,\r\nperhaps, upon Mr. Croll's theory, be comparatively a recent event; for\r\nif the secular summer of the earth's eccentricity lags relatively as\r\nfar behind the secular movements as the annual summer does behind the\r\nvernal equinox, we should, as Professor Charles H. Hitchcock suggests,\r\nhave to place the complete breaking up of the Ice period as late as forty\r\nthousand years ago.[DT]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DT: Geology of New Hampshire, vol. iii, p.327.]\r\n\r\nWe have no space to indicate, as it deserves, the comparative merits\r\nand demerits of this ingenious theory. It would, however, be a great\r\ncalamity to have geologists accept it without scrutiny. It is, indeed,\r\na part of the business of geologists to doubt such theories until they\r\nare verified by a thorough examination of all accessible _terrestrial_\r\nevidence bearing upon the subject. There is no reason to question the\r\nreality of the variations in the relative positions of the earth and the\r\nsun assumed by Mr. Croll; though there may be serious doubt whether the\r\neffects of those changes upon climate would be all that is surmised,\r\nsince equal amounts of heat would fall upon the earth during summer,\r\nwhether made longer or shorter by the cause referred to. During the short\r\nsummers the earth is so much nearer the sun that it receives each season\r\nabsolutely as much heat as it does during the longer summers, when it\r\nis so much farther away from the sun. Thus the theory rests at last upon\r\nthe question what would become of the heat reaching the earth in these\r\ndiffering conditions. It is plausibly urged by Mr. Croll that when a\r\nhemisphere of the earth is passing through a period of long winters the\r\nradiation of heat will be so excessive that the temperature would fall\r\nmuch below what it would during the shorter winters; and so ice and snow\r\nwould accumulate far beyond the usual amount. It is also supposed that\r\nthe effect of the summer's sun in melting the ice during the short summer\r\nwould be diminished through natural increase of the amount of foggy and\r\ncloudy weather.\r\n\r\nAdhémar's theory is supposed by Sir Robert Ball, Royal Astronomer of\r\nIreland, to be considerably re-enforced by a discovery which he has made\r\nconcerning the distribution of heat upon the earth during the seasons\r\nculminating in the summer and winter solstices. Croll had assumed,\r\non the authority of Herschel, that a hemisphere of the earth during\r\nthe longer winter in aphelion would receive the same actual amount of\r\nheat which would fall upon it during the shorter summer in perihelion;\r\nwhereas, according to Dr. Ball's discovery, \"of the total amount of heat\r\nreceived from the sun on a hemisphere of the earth in the course of a\r\nyear, sixty-three per cent is received during the summer and thirty-seven\r\nper cent during the winter.\"[DU] When, therefore, the summers occur in\r\nperihelion the heat is more intense than Croll had supposed, and, at\r\nthe same time, the winters occurring in aphelion are more deficient in\r\nheat than he had assumed. This discovery of Dr. Ball will not, however,\r\nmaterially affect the discussion of Croll's theory upon its inherent\r\nmerits, since it is simply an intensification of the causes invoked by\r\nhim. We will therefore let it stand or fall in the light of the general\r\nconsiderations hereafter to be adduced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DU: Cause of an Ice Age, p. 90.]\r\n\r\nThe aid of theoretical consequent changes in the volume of the Gulf\r\nStream, and in the area of the trade-winds, has also to be invoked by\r\nMr. Croll. The theory likewise receives supposed confirmation from facts\r\nalleged concerning the present climate of the southern hemisphere which\r\nis passing through the astronomical conditions thought to be favourable\r\nto its glaciation. The antarctic continent is completely enveloped in\r\nice, even down to the sixty-seventh degree of latitude. A few degrees\r\nnearer the pole Sir J. C. Boss describes the ice as rising from the water\r\nin a precipitous wall one hundred and eighty feet high. In front of such\r\na wall, and nearly twenty degrees from the south pole, this navigator\r\nsailed four hundred and fifty miles! Voyagers, in general, are said to\r\nagree that the summers of the antarctic zone are much more foggy and cold\r\nthan they are in corresponding latitudes in the northern hemisphere; and\r\nthis, even though the sun is 3,000,000 miles nearer the earth during the\r\nsouthern summer than it is during the northern.\r\n\r\nAnother direction from which evidence is invoked in confirmation of Mr.\r\nCroll's theory is the geological indications of successive Glacial epochs\r\nin times past. If there be a recurring astronomical cause sufficient of\r\nitself to produce Glacial periods, such periods should recur as often as\r\nthe cause exists; but glaciation upon the scale of that which immediately\r\npreceded the historic era could hardly have occurred in early geological\r\ntime without leaving marks which geologists would have discovered. Were\r\nthe \"till\" now covering the glaciated region to be converted into rock,\r\nits character would be unmistakable, and the deposit is so extensive that\r\nit could not escape notice.\r\n\r\nIn his inaugural address before the British Association in 1880,\r\nProfessor Ramsey, Director-General of the Geological Survey of Great\r\nBritain, presented a formidable list of glacial observations in\r\nconnection with rocks of a remote age.[DV] Beginning at the earliest\r\ndate, he cites Professor Archibald Geikie, one of the most competent\r\njudges, as confident that the rounded knobs and knolls of Laurentian\r\nrocks exposed over a large region in northwestern Scotland, together\r\nwith vast beds of coarse, angular, unstratified conglomerates, are\r\nunquestionable evidences of glacial action at that early period. Masses\r\nof similar conglomerates, resembling consolidated glacial boulder-beds,\r\noccur also in the Lower Silurian formation at Corswall, England. In\r\nDunbar, Scotland, Professor Forbes also found, in formations of but\r\nlittle later age than the Coal period, \"brecciated conglomerates,\r\nconsisting of pebbles and large blocks of stone, generally angular,\r\nembedded in a marly paste, in which some of the pebbles are as well\r\nscratched as those found in medial moraines.\" In formations of\r\ncorresponding antiquity the geologists of India have found similar\r\nboulder-beds, in which some of the blocks are polished and striated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DV: Nature (August 26, 1880), vol. xxii, pp. 388, 389.]\r\n\r\nStill, this evidence is less abundant than we should expect, if there had\r\nbeen the repeated Glacial epochs supposed by Mr. Croll's astronomical\r\ntheory; and it is by no means impossible that the conglomerates of\r\nscratched stones described by Professor Ramsey in Great Britain, and\r\nby Messrs. Blandford and Medlicott in India, may have resulted from\r\nlocal glaciers coming down from mountain-chains which have been since\r\nremoved by erosion or subsidence. We are not aware that any incontestable\r\nevidence has been presented in America of any glaciation previous to that\r\nof _the_ Glacial period.\r\n\r\nUpon close consideration, also, it appears that Mr. Croll's theory has\r\nnot properly taken into account the anomalous distribution of heat which\r\nwe actually find to take place on the surface of the earth. He has done\r\ngood service in showing what an enormous transfer of heat there is\r\nfrom the southern to the northern Atlantic by means of the Gulf Stream,\r\nestimating that the heat conveyed by the Gulf Stream into the Atlantic\r\nOcean is equal to one fifth of all possessed by the waters of the North\r\nAtlantic; or to the heat received from the sun upon a million and a half\r\nsquare miles at the equator, or two million square miles in the temperate\r\nzone. \"The stoppage of the Gulf Stream would deprive the Atlantic of\r\n77,479,650,000,000,000,000 foot-pounds of energy in the form of heat per\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the objections which bear against this ingenious theory is one\r\nwhich will appear with great force when we come to discuss the date of\r\nthe Glacial period, when we shall show that even Professor Hitchcock's\r\nsupposition that the lingering effects of the last great eccentricity of\r\nthe earth's orbit, continued down to forty thousand years ago, is not\r\nsufficient to account for the recentness of the close of the period as\r\nshown by abundant geological evidence. It is certainly not more than ten\r\nor fifteen thousand years ago that the ice finally melted off from the\r\nLaurentian highlands; while on the Pacific coast the period of glaciation\r\nwas still more recent.\r\n\r\nFrom inspection of the accompanying map the main point of Mr. Croll's\r\nreasoning may be understood. It will be seen that the direction of the\r\ncurrents in the central Atlantic is largely determined by the contour of\r\nthe northeastern coast of South America. From some cause the southeast\r\ntrade-winds are stronger than the northeast, and their force is felt in\r\npushing the superficial currents of warm water farther north than Cape\r\nSt. Roque, the eastern extremity of Brazil. As the direction of the South\r\nAmerican coast trends rapidly westward from this point to the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, the resultant of the forces is a strong current northwestward\r\ninto the _cul-de-sac_ of the Gulf of Mexico, from which there is only the\r\none outlet between Cuba and the peninsula of Florida. Through this the\r\nwarm water is forced into the region where westerly winds prevail, and\r\nspreads its genial influence far to the northward, modifying the climate\r\nof the British Isles, and even of far-off Norway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100.--Map showing course of currents in the Atlantic\r\nOcean: _b_ and _b'_ are currents set in motion by opposite trade-winds;\r\nmeeting, they produce the equatorial current, which divides into _c_ and\r\n_c'_, continuing on as _a_ and _a'_ and _e_.]\r\n\r\nBut why are the southeast trade-winds of the Atlantic stronger than\r\nthe northeast? The ultimate reason, of course, is to be found in the\r\nfact that the northern hemisphere is warmer than the southern. The\r\natmosphere over the northern-central portion of the Atlantic region is\r\nmore thoroughly rarefied by the sun's heat than is that over the region\r\nsouth of the equator. The strong southeast trades are simply the rush of\r\natmosphere from the South Atlantic to fill the vacuum caused by the heat\r\nof the sun north of the equator.\r\n\r\nBut, again, why is this? Because, says Mr. Croll, we are now in that\r\nstage of astronomical development favourable to the increased warmth\r\nof the northern hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere the summers are\r\nlonger than the winters. Perihelion occurs in winter and aphelion in\r\nsummer. This is the reason why the North Atlantic is warmer than the\r\nSouth Atlantic, and why the trade-winds of the south are drawn to the\r\nnorth of the equator. Ten thousand five hundred years ago, however, the\r\nconditions were reversed, and the greater rarefaction of the atmosphere\r\nwould have taken place south of the equator, thus drawing the trade-winds\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nBy again inspecting the map, one will see how far-reaching the effect on\r\nthe climate of northern countries this change in the prevalences of the\r\ntrades would have been. Then, instead of having the northwest current\r\nleading along the northeast coast of South America into the Gulf of\r\nMexico augmented by the warm currents circulating south of the equator,\r\nthe warm currents of the north would have been pushed down so far that\r\nthey would augment the current running to the southwest beyond Cape St.\r\nRoque, along the southeast shore of South America; thus the northern\r\nportion of the Atlantic, instead of robbing the southern portion of\r\nheat, would itself be robbed of its warm currents to contribute to the\r\nsuperfluous heat of the South Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThis theory is certainly very ingenious. There is a weak point in\r\nit, however. Mr. Croll assumes that when the winters of the northern\r\nhemisphere occur in aphelion, they must necessarily be colder than now.\r\nBut, evidently, this assertion implies a fuller knowledge than we possess\r\nof the laws by which the heat received from the sun is distributed over\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nFor it appears from observation that the equator is by no means so\r\nhot now as, theoretically, it ought to be, and that the arctic regions\r\nare not so cold as, according to theory, they should be, and this in\r\nplaces which could not be affected by oceanic currents. For example,\r\nat Iquitos, on the Amazon, only three hundred feet above tide, three\r\ndegrees and a half south of the equator, and more than a thousand miles\r\nfrom the Atlantic (so that ocean-currents cannot abstract the heat from\r\nits vicinity), the mean yearly temperature is but 78° Fahr.; while at\r\nVerkhojansk, in northeast Siberia, which is 67° north of the equator, and\r\nis situated where it is out of the reach of ocean-currents, and where\r\nthe conditions for the radiation of heat are most favourable, and where,\r\nindeed, the winter is the coldest on the globe (January averaging--56°\r\nFahr.), the mean yearly temperature is two degrees and a half above zero;\r\nso that the difference between the temperature upon the equator and that\r\nat the coldest point on the sixty-seventh parallel is only about 75°\r\nFahr.; whereas, if temperature were in proportion to heat received from\r\nthe sun, the difference ought to be 172°. Again, the difference between\r\nthe actual January temperature on the fiftieth parallel and that upon the\r\nsixtieth is but 20° Fahr., whereas, the quantity of solar heat received\r\non the fiftieth parallel during the month of January is three times that\r\nreceived upon the sixtieth, and the difference in temperature ought to be\r\nabout 170° Fahr. upon any known law in the case.\r\n\r\nWoeikoff, a Russian meteorologist, and one of the ablest critics of Mr.\r\nCroll's theory, and to whom we are indebted for these facts, ascribes\r\nthe greater present warmth of the northern Atlantic basin, not to the\r\nastronomical cause invoked by Mr. Croll, but to the relatively small\r\nextent of sea in the middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere. The\r\nextent and depth of the oceans of the southern hemisphere would of\r\nthemselves give greater steadiness and force to its trade-winds, and\r\nlead to a general lowering of the temperature; so that it is doubtful\r\nif the astronomical causes introduced by Mr. Croll, even with Dr.\r\nBall's re-enforcement, would produce any appreciable effect while the\r\ndistribution of land and water remains substantially what it is at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nStill another variation in the astronomical theory has been set forth\r\nand defended by Major-General A. W. Drayson, F. R. A. S., instructor\r\nin the Royal Military School at Woolwich, England. He contends that\r\nwhat has been called the precession of the equinoxes, and supposed to\r\nbe \"a conical movement of the earth's axis in a circle around a point\r\nas a centre, from which it continually decreases its distance,\"[DW] is\r\nreally a second rotation of the earth about its centre. As a consequence\r\nof this second rotation, he endeavours to show that the inclination of\r\nthe earth's axis varies as much as 12°; so that, whereas the Arctic and\r\nAntarctic Circles and the tropics extend to only about 23° from the poles\r\nand the equator, respectively, about thirteen thousand five hundred years\r\nago they extended more than 35°; thus bringing the frigid zones in both\r\ncases 12° nearer the equator than now. This, he contends, would have\r\nproduced the Glacial period at the time now more generally assigned to it\r\nby direct geological evidence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DW: Untrodden Ground in Astronomy and Geology, p. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with this theory, even if the mathematical calculations\r\nupon which it is based are correct, would be substantially the same as\r\nthose already urged against that of Mr. Croll. It is specially difficult\r\nto see how General Drayson would account for the prolonged temperate\r\nclimate in high northern latitudes during the larger part of the Tertiary\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nIt will be best to turn again to the map to observe the possible effect\r\nupon the Gulf Stream of a geological event of which we have some definite\r\nevidence, and which is adduced by Mr. Upham and others as one of the\r\nimportant probable causes of the Glacial period, namely, the subsidence\r\nof the Isthmus of Panama and the adjacent narrow neck of land connecting\r\nNorth with South America. It will be seen at a glance that a subsidence\r\nsufficient to allow the northwest current of warm water, pushed by the\r\ntrade-winds along the northeast shore of South America, to pass into\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, instead of into the Gulf of Mexico, would be a cause\r\nsufficient to produce the most far-reaching results; it would rob the\r\nNorth Atlantic of the immense amount of heat and moisture now distributed\r\nover it by the Gulf Stream, and would add an equal amount to the northern\r\nPacific Ocean, and modify to an unknown extent the distribution of heat\r\nand moisture over the lands of the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe supposition that a subsidence of the Isthmus of Panama was among\r\nthe contributing causes of the Glacial period has been often made, but\r\nwithout any positive proof of such subsidence. From evidence which\r\nhas recently come to light, however, it is certain that there has\r\nactually been considerable subsidence there in late Tertiary if not in\r\npost-Tertiary times. This evidence is furnished by Dr. G. A. Maack and\r\nMr. William M. Gabb in their report to the United States Government in\r\n1874 upon the explorations for a ship-canal across the isthmus, and\r\nconsists of numerous fossils belonging to existing species which are\r\nfound at an elevation of 150 feet above tide. As the dividing ridge is\r\nmore than 700 feet above tide, this does not positively prove the point,\r\nbut so much demonstrated subsidence makes it easy to believe, in the\r\nabsence of contradictory evidence, that there was more, and that the\r\nisthmus was sufficiently submerged to permit a considerable portion of\r\nthe warm equatorial current which now passes northward from the Caribbean\r\nSea and the Gulf of Mexico to pass into the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101.--Map showing how the land clusters about the\r\nnorth pole.]\r\n\r\nAn obvious objection to the theory of a late Tertiary or post-Tertiary\r\nsubsidence of the Isthmus of Panama presents itself in the fact that\r\nthere is at present a complete diversity of species between the fish\r\ninhabiting the waters upon the different sides of the isthmus. If\r\nthere had been such a subsidence, it seems natural to suppose that\r\nAtlantic species would have migrated to the Pacific side and obtained\r\na permanent lodgment there, and that Pacific species would have found\r\na congenial home on the Atlantic side. It must be confessed that this\r\nis a serious theoretical difficulty, but perhaps not insuperable. For\r\nit is by no means certain that colonists from the heated waters of the\r\nCaribbean Sea would become so permanently established upon the Pacific\r\nside that they could maintain themselves there upon the re-establishment\r\nof former conditions. On the contrary, it seems reasonable to suppose\r\nthat upon the re-elevation of the isthmus the northern currents, which\r\nwould then resume their course, would bring back with them conditions\r\nunfavourable to the Atlantic species, and favourable to the competing\r\nspecies which had only temporarily withdrawn from the field, and which\r\nmight now be better fitted than ever to renew the struggle with their\r\nAtlantic competitors. It is by no means certain, therefore, that with\r\nthe re-establishment of the former conditions there would not also be a\r\nre-establishment of the former equation of life upon the two sides of the\r\nisthmus.\r\n\r\nMr. Upham's theory involves also extensive elevations of land in the\r\nnorthern part of America; in this respect agreeing with the opinions\r\nearly expressed by Professors J. D. Dana and J. S. Newberry. Of the\r\npositive indications of such northward elevations of land we have already\r\nspoken when treating in a previous chapter of the fiords and submerged\r\nchannels which characterise northern Europe and both the eastern and\r\nthe western coasts of North America. But in working out the problem the\r\nsolution is only half reached when we have got the Gulf Stream into\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, and the land in the northern part of the continents\r\nelevated to some distance above its present level. There is still the\r\ndifficulty of getting the moisture-laden currents from the Pacific Ocean\r\nto carry their burdens over the crest of the Sierra Nevada and Rocky\r\nMountains and to deposit them in snow upon the Laurentian highlands.\r\nAn ingenious supplement to the theory, therefore, has been brought\r\nforward by Professor Carpenter, who suggests that the immense Tertiary\r\nand post-Tertiary lava-flows which cover so much of the area west of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains were the cause of the accumulations of snow which\r\nformed the Laurentide Glacier. This statement, which at first seems so\r\nparadoxical as to be absurd, appears less so upon close examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extent of the outflows of lava west of the Rocky Mountains is almost\r\nbeyond comprehension. Literally, hundreds of thousands of square miles\r\nhave been covered by them to a depth in many places of thousands of feet.\r\nThese volcanic eruptions are mostly of late date, beginning in the middle\r\nof the Tertiary and culminating probably about the time of the maximum\r\nextent of the Laurentide Glacier. Indeed, so nearly contemporaneous was\r\nthe growth of the Laurentide Glacier with these outflows that Professor\r\nAlexander Winchell had, with a good deal of plausibility, suggested that\r\nthe outflows of the eruptions of lava were caused by the accumulation\r\nof ice over eastern British America. His theory was that the three\r\nmillion cubic miles of ice which is proved to have been abstracted from\r\nthe ocean and piled up over that area was so serious a disturbance of\r\nthe equilibrium of the earth's crust that it caused great fissures to\r\nbe opened along the lines of weakness west of the Rocky Mountains, and\r\npressed the liquid lava out, as the juice is pressed out of an orange in\r\none place by pressing upon the rind in another.\r\n\r\nProfessor Carpenter's view is the exact reverse of Professor Winchell's.\r\nGoing back to those orographic changes which produced the lava-flows\r\nand the elevation of the northern part of British America, he thinks\r\nthe problem of getting the moisture transferred from the Pacific Ocean\r\nto the Canadian highlands is solved by the lava-flows west of the Rocky\r\nMountains. This immense exudation of molten matter was accompanied by an\r\nenormous liberation of heat, which must have produced significant changes\r\nin the meteorological conditions.\r\n\r\nThe moisture of the atmosphere is precipitated by means of the\r\ncondensation connected with a lowering of its temperature. Ordinarily,\r\ntherefore, when moist winds from an oceanic area pass directly over a\r\nlofty mountain-chain, the precipitation takes place immediately, and\r\nthe water finds its way back by a short course to the sea. This is what\r\nnow actually occurs on the Pacific coast. The Sierra Nevada condense\r\nnearly all the moisture; so that very little falls on the vast area\r\nextending from their summits eastward to the Rocky Mountains. All that\r\nregion is now practically a desert land, where the evaporation exceeds\r\nthe precipitation. In Professor Carpenter's view the heat radiated from\r\nthe freshly exuded lava is supposed to have prevented the precipitation\r\nnear the coast-line, and to have helped the winds in carrying it farther\r\nonward to the northeast, where it would be condensed upon the elevated\r\nhighlands, upon which the snows of the great Laurentide Glacier were\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for us to attempt to measure the amount of truth in\r\nthis subsidiary hypothesis of Professor Carpenter, but it illustrates\r\nhow complicated are the conditions which have to be considered before we\r\nrest securely upon any particular hypothesis. The unknown elements of the\r\nproblem are so numerous, and so far-reaching in their possible scope,\r\nthat a cautious attitude of agnosticism, with respect to the cause of\r\nthe Glacial period, is most scientific and becoming. Still, we are ready\r\nto go so far as to say that Mr. Upham's theory comes nearest to giving\r\na satisfactory account of all the phenomena, and it is to this that\r\nProfessor Joseph Le Conte gives his cautious approval.\r\n\r\nSummarily stated, this theory is, that the passage from the Tertiary\r\nto the Quaternary or Glacial period was characterised by remarkable\r\noscillations of land-level, and by corresponding changes of climate, and\r\nof ice-accumulation in northern regions; that the northern elevation\r\nwas connected with subsidence in the equatorial regions; that these\r\nchanges of land-level were both initiated and, in the main, continued\r\nby the interior geological forces of the globe; but that the very\r\ncontinental elevation which mainly brought on the Glacial period added\r\nat length, in the weight of the ice which accumulated over the elevated\r\nregion, a new force to hasten and increase the subsidence, which would\r\nhave taken place in due time in the natural progress of the orographic\r\noscillations already begun. Professor Le Conte illustrates the subject by\r\nthe following diagram, which, for simplicity's sake, treats the Glacial\r\nepoch as one; the horizontal line, A B, represents time from the later\r\nPliocene until now; but it also represents the present condition of\r\nthings both as to land-level and as to ice-accumulation. The full line, c\r\nd e, represents the oscillations of land (and presumably of temperature)\r\nabove and below the present condition. The broken line represents the\r\nrise, culmination, and decline of ice-accumulation. The dotted line\r\nrepresents the crust-movement as it would have been if there had been no\r\nice-accumulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102.]\r\n\r\n_Succession of Epochs, Glacial and Fluvial Deposits, and_\r\n\r\n                   Eastern Provinces and     Middle and Southern\r\n  Epochs.

But the fact that the land,\r\nafter the removal of the ice-load, did not return again to its former\r\nheight in the Pliocene, is proof positive that there were other and\r\nmore fundamental causes of crust-movement at work besides weighting and\r\nlightening. The land did not again return to its former level because the\r\ncycle of elevation, whatever its cause, which commenced in the Pliocene\r\nand culminated in the early Quaternary, had exhausted itself. If it had\r\nnot been for the ice-load interfering with and modifying the natural\r\ncourse of the crust-movement determined previously and primarily by other\r\nand probably internal causes, the latter would probably have taken the\r\ncourse represented by the dotted line. It would have risen higher and\r\nculminated later, and its curve would have been of simpler form.\r\n\r\nWe append a carefully prepared table by Mr. Warren Upham, showing the\r\nprobable changes in altitude and climate during the Quaternary era.[DX]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DX: On page 106 and sequel I have summarised the reasons which\r\nlead me to discard the Inter-Glacial epoch, and to look upon the whole\r\nGlacial period as constituting a grand unity with minor episodes. It\r\ndoes not yet seem to me that the duality of the period is proved. On the\r\ncontrary, Mr. Kendall's chapter on the Glacial phenomena of Great Britain\r\nstrongly confirms my view.]\r\n\r\nOn the part of many the theory here provisionally adopted will be\r\nregarded with disfavour by reason of a disinclination to supposing\r\nany great recent changes of level in the continental areas. So firmly\r\nestablished do the continents appear to be, that it seems like invoking\r\nan inordinate display of power to have them exalted for the sake of\r\nproducing a Glacial period. Due reflection, however, will make it\r\nevident that within certain limits the continents are exceedingly\r\nunstable, and that they have displayed this instability to as great an\r\nextent in recent geological times as they have done in any previous\r\ngeological periods. When one reflects, also, upon the size of the earth,\r\na continental elevation of 3,000 or 4,000 feet upon a globe whose\r\ndiameter is more than 40,000,000 feet is an insignificant trifle. On a\r\nglobe one foot in diameter it would be represented by a protuberance of\r\nbarely one thousandth of an inch. A corresponding wrinkle upon a large\r\napple would require a magnifying-glass for its detection. Moreover, the\r\nactivity of existing volcanoes, the immense outflows of lava which have\r\ntaken place in the later geological periods, together with the uniform\r\nincrease of heat as we penetrate to deeper strata in the crust of the\r\nearth--all point to a condition of the earth's interior that would\r\nmake the elevations of land which we have invoked for the production\r\nof the Glacial period easily credible. Physicists do not, indeed, now\r\nhold to the entire fluidity of the earth's interior, but rather to a\r\nsolid centre, where gravity overcomes the expansive power of heat, and\r\nmaintains solidity even when the heat is intense. But between the cooling\r\ncrust of the earth's exterior and a central solid core there is now\r\nbelieved to be a film where the influences of heat and of the pressure\r\nof gravity are approximately balanced, and the space is occupied by a\r\nhalf-melted or viscous magma, capable of yielding to a slow pressure, and\r\nof moving in response to it from one portion of the enclosed space to\r\nanother where the pressure is for any cause relieved.\r\n\r\nAs a result of prolonged enquiries respecting the nature of the forces\r\nat work both in the interior and upon the exterior of the earth, and\r\nof a careful study of the successive changes marking the geological\r\nperiod, we are led to believe that the continental elevations necessary\r\nto produce the phenomena of the Glacial period are not only entirely\r\npossible but easily credible, and in analogy with the natural progress\r\nof geological history. In the first place, it is easy to see that\r\ntwo causes are in operation to produce a contraction of the earth's\r\nvolume and a shortening of its diameter. Heat is constantly being\r\nabstracted from the earth by conduction and radiation, but perhaps to\r\na greater extent through ceaseless volcanic eruptions which at times\r\nare of enormous extent. It requires but a moment's thought to see that\r\ncontraction of the volume of the earth's interior means that the hardened\r\nexterior crust must adjust itself by wrinkles and folds. For a long\r\nperiod this adjustment might show itself principally in gentle swells,\r\nlifting portions of the continents to a higher level, accompanied by\r\ncorresponding subsidence in other places. This gradually accumulating\r\nstrain would at length be relieved along some line of special weakness in\r\nthe crust by that folding process which has pushed up the great mountain\r\nsystems of the world.\r\n\r\nCareful study of the principal mountain systems shows that all the\r\nhighest of them are of late geological origin. Indeed, the latter part\r\nof the Tertiary period has been the great mountain-building epoch in the\r\nearth's history. The principal part of the elevation of the Andes and\r\nthe Rocky Mountains has taken place since the middle of the Tertiary\r\nperiod. In Europe there is indubitable evidence that the Pyrenees have\r\nbeen elevated eleven thousand feet during the same period, and that the\r\nwestern Alps have been elevated thirteen thousand feet in the same time.\r\nThe Carpathians, the western Caucasus, and the Himalayas likewise bear\r\nexplicit evidence to the fact that a very considerable portion of their\r\nelevation, amounting to many thousand feet, has been effected since the\r\nmiddle of the Tertiary period, while a considerable portion of this\r\nelevation of the chiefest mountain systems of the world has occurred in\r\nwhat would be called post-Tertiary time--that is, has been coincident\r\nwith a portion of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\nThe Glacial period, however, we suppose to have been brought about, not\r\nby the specific plications in the earth's crust which have produced the\r\nmountain-chains, but by the gentler swells of larger continental areas\r\nwhose strain was at last relieved by the folding and mashing together\r\nof the strata along the lines of weakness now occupied by the mountain\r\nsystems. The formation of the mountains seems to have relieved the\r\naccumulating strain connected with the continental elevations, and to\r\nhave brought about a subsequent subsidence.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, also, correlated subsidences and elevations of the earth's\r\ncrust have been aided by the transfer of the sediment from continental\r\nto oceanic areas, and, as already suggested, during the Glacial period\r\nby the transfer of water evaporated from the surface of the ocean to\r\nthe ice-fields of the glaciated area. For example, present erosive\r\nagencies are lowering the level of the whole Mississippi basin from\r\nthe Alleghanies to the Rocky Mountains at the rate of a foot in five\r\nthousand years. All this sediment removed is being transferred to the\r\nocean-bed. Present agencies, therefore, if not counteracted, would\r\nremove the whole continent of America (whose average elevation above the\r\nsea is only 748 feet) in less than four million years; while the great\r\nrivers which descend in all directions from the central plateau of Asia\r\nare transferring sediment to the ocean from two to four times as fast\r\nas the Mississippi is, and the Po is transferring it from the Alps to\r\nthe Adriatic fully seven times as fast as the Mississippi is from its\r\nbasin to the Gulf of Mexico. This rapid transfer of sediment from the\r\ncontinents to the ocean is producing effects in disturbing the present\r\nequilibrium of the earth's crust, which are too complicated for us fully\r\nto calculate; but it is by no means improbable that when accumulating for\r\na considerable length of time, the ultimate results may be very marked\r\nand perhaps sudden in their appearance.\r\n\r\nThe same may also be said of the accumulation of ice during the Glacial\r\nperiod. The glaciated areas of North America and Europe combined\r\ncomprise about six million square miles. At a moderate estimate,\r\nthe ice was three-quarters of a mile deep. Here, therefore, there\r\nwould be between four and five million cubic miles of water, which\r\nhad first relieved the ocean-beds of the pressure of its weight, and\r\nthen concentrated its force over the elevated areas of the northern\r\nhemisphere. This disturbance of the equilibrium, by the known transfer\r\nof force from one part of the earth's crust to another, certainly gives\r\nmuch plausibility to the theory of Jamieson, Winchell, Le Conte, and\r\nUpham, that the Glacial period partly contained in itself its own cure,\r\nand by the weight of its accumulated weight of ice helped to produce\r\nthat depression over the glaciated area which at length rendered the\r\naccumulation of ice there impossible.\r\n\r\nThis general view of the known causes in operation during the Glacial\r\nperiod will go far towards answering an objection that has probably\r\nbefore this presented itself to the reader's mind. It seems clear\r\nthat the Glacial period in the southern hemisphere has been nearly\r\ncontemporaneous with that of the northern. The Glacial period proper of\r\nthe southern hemisphere is long since passed. The existing glaciers of\r\nNew Zealand, of the southern portion of the Andes Mountains, and of the\r\nHimalaya Mountains are but remnants of those of former days. In the light\r\nof the considerations just presented, it would not seem improbable that\r\nthe same causes should produce these similar effects in the northern and\r\nthe southern hemisphere contemporaneously. At any rate, it would not\r\nseem altogether unlikely that the pressure of ice during the climax of\r\nthe Glacial period upon the northern hemisphere (which, as we have seen,\r\nthere is reason to believe aided in the depression of the continent to\r\nbelow its present level in the latter part of the Glacial period) should\r\nhave contributed towards the elevation of mountains in other parts of the\r\nworld, and so to the temporary enlargement of the glaciers about their\r\nsummits.\r\n\r\nNor are we wholly without evidence that these readjustments of land-level\r\nwhich have been carried on so Vigorously since the middle of the Tertiary\r\nperiod are still going on with considerable though doubtless with\r\ndiminished rapidity. There has been a re-elevation of the land in North\r\nAmerica since the Glacial period amounting to 230 feet upon the coast of\r\nMaine, 500 feet in the vicinity of Montreal, from 1,000 to 1,600 feet in\r\nthe extreme northern part of the continent, and in Scandinavia to the\r\nextent of 600 feet. In portions of Scandinavia the land is now rising\r\nat the rate of three feet in a century. Other indications of even the\r\npresent instability of the earth's surface occur in numbers too numerous\r\nto mention.[DY]\r\n\r\n[Footnote DY: For a convincing presentation of the views here outlined,\r\ntogether with abundant references to literature, see Mr. Warren Upham's\r\nAppendix to the author's Ice Age in North America.]\r\n\r\nBut, while we are increasingly confident that the main causes of the\r\nGlacial period have been changes in the relative relation of land-levels\r\nconnected with diversion of oceanic currents, it is by no means\r\nimpossible, as Wallace[DZ] and others have suggested, that these were\r\ncombined with the astronomical causes urged by Drs. Croll and Geikie.\r\nBy some this combination is thought to be the more probable, because\r\nof the extreme recentness of the close of the Glacial period, as shown\r\nby the evidence which will be presented in the following chapter. The\r\ncontinuance of glaciers in the highlands of Canada, down to within a few\r\nthousand years of the present time, coincides in a remarkable manner with\r\nthe last occurrence of the conditions favourable to glaciation upon Mr.\r\nCroll's theory, which took place about eleven thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote DZ: See Island Life, chapters viii and ix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE DATE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn approaching the subject of glacial chronology, we are compelled\r\nto recognise at the outset the approximate character of all our\r\ncalculations. Still, we shall find that there are pretty well-defined\r\nlimits of time beyond which it is not reasonable to place the date of\r\nthe close of the Glacial period; and, where exact figures cannot be\r\ndetermined, it may yet be of great interest and importance to know\r\nsomething near the limits within which our speculations must range.\r\n\r\nFor many years past Mr. Croll's astronomical theory as to the cause of\r\nthe Glacial period has been considered in certain circles as so nearly\r\nestablished that it has been adopted by them as a chronological table in\r\nwhich to insert a series of supposed successive Glacial epochs which are\r\nthought to have characterised not merely the Quaternary epoch but all\r\npreceding geological eras. What we have already said, however, respecting\r\nthe weakness of Mr. Croll's theory is probably sufficient to discredit it\r\nas a chronological apparatus. We will therefore turn immediately to the\r\nmore tangible evidences bearing upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe data directly relating to the length of time which separates the\r\npresent from the Glacial period are mainly connected with two classes of\r\nfacts:\r\n\r\n1. The amount of erosion which has been accomplished by the river systems\r\nsince the Glacial period; and 2. The amount of sedimentation which\r\nhas taken place in lakes and kettle-holes. We will consider first the\r\nevidence from erosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103.--Diagram of eccentricity and precession:\r\nAbscissa represents time and ordinates, degrees of eccentricity and also\r\nof cold. The dark and light shades show the warmer and colder winters,\r\nand therefore indicate each 10,500 years, the whole representing a period\r\nof 300,000 years.]\r\n\r\nThe gorge below Niagara Falls affords an important chronometer for\r\nmeasuring the time which has elapsed since a certain stage in the\r\nrecession of the great North American ice-sheet. As already shown, the\r\npresent Niagara River is purely a post-glacial line of drainage;[EA] the\r\npreglacial outlet to Lake Erie having been filled up by glacial deposits,\r\nso that, on the recession of the ice, the lowest level between Lake Erie\r\nand Lake Ontario was in the line of the trough of the present outlet.\r\nBut, from what has already been said, it also appears that the Niagara\r\nRiver did not begin to flow until considerably after the ice-front had\r\nwithdrawn from the escarpment at Queenston, where the river now emerges\r\nfrom its cañon to the low shelf which borders Lake Ontario. For a\r\nconsiderable period afterwards the ice continued to block up the easterly\r\nand northerly outlets through the valleys of the Mohawk and of the St.\r\nLawrence, and held the water in front of the ice up to the level of the\r\npasses leading into the Mississippi Valley. Niagara River, of course, was\r\nnot born until these ice-barriers on the east and northeast melted away\r\nsufficiently to allow the drainage to take its natural course.\r\n\r\n[Footnote EA: See above, p. 200 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104.--Map of the Niagara River below the falls,\r\nshowing the buried channel from the whirlpool to St. Davids. Small\r\nstreams, _a_, _b_, _c_, fall into the main gorge over a rocky escarpment.\r\nNo rock appears in the channel at _d_, but the rocky escarpment reappears\r\nat _e_.]\r\n\r\nOf these barriers, that across the Mohawk Valley doubtless gave way\r\nfirst. This would allow the confluent waters of this great glacial lake\r\nto fall down to the level of the old outlet from the basin of Lake\r\nOntario into the Mohawk Valley, in the vicinity of Home, N. Y. The\r\nmoment, however, that the water had fallen to this level, the plunging\r\ntorrents of Niagara would begin their work; and the gorge extending from\r\nQueenston up to the present falls is the work done by this great river\r\nsince that point of time in the Glacial period when the ice-barrier\r\nacross the Mohawk Valley broke away.\r\n\r\nThe problem is therefore a simple one. Considering the length of\r\nthis gorge as the dividend, the object is to find the rate of annual\r\nrecession; this will be the divisor. The quotient will be the number of\r\nyears which have elapsed since the ice first melted away from the Mohawk\r\nValley. We are favoured in our calculation by the simplicity of the\r\ngeologic arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe strata at Niagara dip slightly to the south, but not enough to make\r\nany serious disturbance in the problem. That at the surface, over which\r\nthe water now plunges, consists of hard limestone, seventy or eighty\r\nfeet in thickness, and this is continuous from the falls to the face of\r\nthe escarpment at Queenston, where the river emerges from the gorge.\r\nImmediately underneath this hard superficial stratum there is a stratum\r\nof soft rock, of about the same thickness, which disintegrates readily.\r\nAs a consequence, the plunging water continually undermines the hard\r\nstratum at the surface, and prepares the way for it to fall down, from\r\ntime to time, in huge blocks, which are, in turn, ground to powder by\r\nthe constant commotion in which they are kept, and thus the channel is\r\ncleared of _débris_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105.--Section of strata along the Niagara gorge from\r\nthe falls to the lake: 1, 3, strata of hard rock; 2, 4, of soft rock.]\r\n\r\nBelow these two main strata there is considerable variation in the\r\nhardness of the rock, as shown in the accompanying diagram, where 3 and\r\n5 are hard strata separated by a soft stratum. In view of this fact it\r\nseems probable that, for a considerable period in the early part of the\r\nrecession, instead of there being simply one, there was a succession of\r\ncataracts, as the water unequally wore back through the harder strata,\r\nnumbered 5, 3, and 1; but, after having receded half the distance, these\r\nwould cease to be disturbing influences, and the problem is thus really\r\nthe simple one of the recession through the strata numbered 1 and 2,\r\nwhich are continuous. So uniform in consistency are these throughout the\r\nwhole distance, that the rate of recession could never have been less\r\nthan it is now. We come, therefore, to the question of the rapidity with\r\nwhich the falls are now receding.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Sir Charles Lyell and Professor James Hall (the State Geologist\r\nof New York) visited the falls together, and estimated that the rate of\r\nrecession could not be greater than one foot a year, which would make the\r\ntime required about thirty-five thousand years. But Lyell thought this\r\nrate was probably three times too large; so that he favoured extending\r\nthe time to one hundred thousand years. Before this the eminent French\r\ngeologist Desor had estimated that the recession could not have been\r\nmore than a foot in a century, which would throw the beginning of the\r\ngorge back more than three million years. But these were mere guesses\r\nof eminent men, based on no well-ascertained facts; while Mr. Bakewell,\r\nan eminent English geologist, trusting to the data furnished him by the\r\nguides and the old residents of Niagara, had, even then, estimated that\r\nthe rate of recession was as much as three feet a year, which would\r\nreduce the whole time required to about ten thousand years.\r\n\r\nBut the visit of Lyell and Hall in 1841 led to the beginning of more\r\naccurate calculations. Professor Hall soon after had a trigonometrical\r\nsurvey of the falls made, from which a map was published in the State\r\ngeological report. From this and from the monuments erected, we have had\r\nsince that time a basis of comparison in which we could place absolute\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nIn recent years three surveys have been made: the first by the New\r\nYork State Geologists, in 1875; and the third by Mr. R. S. Woodward,\r\nthe mathematician of the United States Geological Survey, in 1886. The\r\naccompanying map shows the outlines of the falls at the time of these\r\nthree measurements, from 1842 to 1886. According to Mr. Woodward, \"the\r\nlength of the front of the Horseshoe Fall is twenty-three hundred feet.\r\nBetween 1842 and 1875 four and a quarter acres of rock were worn away by\r\nthe recession of the falls. Between 1875 and 1886 a little over one acre\r\nand a third disappeared in a similar manner, making in all, from 1842 to\r\n1886, about five and a half acres removed, and giving an annual rate of\r\nrecession of about two feet and a half per year for the last forty-five\r\nyears. But in the central parts of the curve, where the water is deepest,\r\nthe Horseshoe Fall retreated between two hundred and two hundred and\r\nseventy-five feet in the eleven years between 1875 and 1886.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106.--Map showing the recession of the Horseshoe\r\nFalls since 1842, as by survey mentioned in the text (Pohlman). (by\r\ncourtesy of the American Institute of Mining Engineers.)]\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that the recession in the centre of the Horseshoe is\r\nvery much more rapid than that nearer the margin; yet this rate at the\r\ncentre is more nearly the standard of calculation than is that near the\r\nmargin, for the gorge constantly tends to enlarge itself below the falls,\r\nand so gradually to bring itself into line with the full-formed channel.\r\nTaking all things into account, Mr. Woodward and the other members of\r\nthe Geological Survey thought it not improbable that the average rate\r\nof actual recession in the Horseshoe Fall was as great as five feet per\r\nannum; and that, if we can rely upon the uniformity of the conditions in\r\nthe past, seven thousand years is as long a period as can be assigned to\r\nits commencement.\r\n\r\nThe only condition in the problem about which there can be much chance of\r\nquestion relates to the constancy of the volume of water flowing in the\r\nNiagara channel. Mr. Gilbert had suggested that, as a consequence of the\r\nsubsidence connected with the closing portions of the Glacial period, the\r\nwater of the Great Lakes may have been largely diverted from its present\r\noutlet in Niagara River and turned northeastward, through Georgian Bay,\r\nFrench River, and Lake Nipissing, into a tributary of the Ottawa River,\r\nand so carried into the St. Lawrence below Lake Ontario. Of this theory\r\nthere is also much direct evidence. A well-defined shore line of rounded\r\npebbles extends, at an elevation of about fifty feet, across the col\r\nfrom Lake Nipissing to the head-waters of the Mattawa, a tributary of\r\nthe Ottawa; while at the junction with the Ottawa there is an enormous\r\ndelta terrace of boulders, forming a bar across the main stream just such\r\nas would result from Mr. Gilbert's supposed outlet. But this outlet was\r\ndoubtless limited to a comparatively few centuries, and Dr. Robert Bell\r\nthinks the evidence still inconclusive.[EB]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EB: See Bul. Geol. Soc. Am., vol. iv, pp. 423-427, vol. v, pp.\r\n620-626.]\r\n\r\nA second noteworthy glacial chronometer is found in the gorge of\r\nthe Mississippi River, extending from the Falls of St. Anthony, at\r\nMinneapolis, to its junction with the preglacial trough of the old\r\nMississippi, at Fort Snelling, a distance likewise of about seven miles.\r\n\r\nAbove Fort Snelling the preglacial gorge is occupied by the Minnesota\r\nRiver, and, as we have before stated, extends to the very sources of\r\nthis river, and is continuous with the southern portion of the valley of\r\nthe trough of the Red River of the North. Before the Glacial period the\r\ndrainage of the present basin of the upper Mississippi joined this main\r\npreglacial valley, not at Fort Snelling, but some little distance above,\r\nas shown upon our map.[EC] This part of the preglacial gorge became\r\npartially filled up with glacial deposits, but it can be still traced\r\nby the lakelets occupying portions of the old depression, and by the\r\nrecords of wells which have been sunk along the line. When the ice-front\r\nhad receded beyond the site of Minneapolis, the only line of drainage\r\nleft open for the water was along the course of the present gorge from\r\nMinneapolis to Fort Snelling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote EC: See above, p. 209.]\r\n\r\nHere, as at Niagara, the problem is comparatively simple. The upper\r\nstrata of rock consist of hard limestone, which is underlaid by a soft\r\nsandstone, which, like the underlying shale at Niagara, is eroded faster\r\nthan the upper strata, and so a perpendicular fall is maintained. The\r\nstrata are so uniform in texture and thickness that, with the present\r\namount of water in the river, the rate of recession of the falls must\r\nhave been, from the beginning, very constant. If, therefore, the rate can\r\nbe determined, the problem can be solved with a good degree of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately, the first discoverer of the cataract--the Catholic\r\nmissionary Hennepin--was an accurate observer, and was given to\r\nrecording his observations for the instruction of the outside world and\r\nof future generations. From his description, printed in Amsterdam in\r\n1704, Professor N. H. Winchell is able to determine the precise locality\r\nof the cataract when discovered in 1680.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1766 the Catholic missionary Carver visited the falls, and not\r\nonly wrote a description, but made a sketch (found in an account of his\r\ntravels, published in London in 1788) which confirms the inferences drawn\r\nfrom Hennepin's narrative. The actual period of recession, however (which\r\nProfessor Winchell duly takes into account), extends only to the year\r\n1856, at which time such artificial changes were introduced as to modify\r\nthe rate of recession and disturb further calculations. But between 1680\r\nand 1766 the falls had evidently receded about 412 feet. Between 1766 and\r\n1856 the recession had been 600 feet. The average rate is estimated by\r\nProfessor Winchell to be about five feet per year, and the total length\r\nof time required for the formation of the gorge above Fort Snelling\r\nis a little less than eight thousand years, or about the same as that\r\ncalculated by Messrs. Woodward and Gilbert for the Niagara gorge.\r\n\r\nTo these calculations of Professor Winchell it does not seem possible\r\nto urge any valid objection. It does not seem credible that the amount\r\nof water in the Mississippi should ever have been less than now, while\r\nduring the continuance of the ice in the upper portion of the Mississippi\r\nbasin the flow of water was certainly far greater than now.\r\n\r\nIf any one is inclined to challenge Professor Winchell's interpretation\r\nof the facts, even a hasty visit to the locality will suffice to produce\r\nconviction. The comparative youth of the gorge from Fort Snelling up to\r\nMinneapolis is evident: 1. From its relative narrowness, when compared\r\nwith the main valley below. This is represented by the shading upon\r\nthe map. The gorge from Fort Snelling up is not old enough to have\r\npermitted much enlargement by the gradual undermining of the superficial\r\nstrata on either side, which slowly but constantly goes on. 2. From\r\nthe abruptness with which it merges into the preglacial valley of the\r\nMinnesota-Mississippi. The opening at Fort Snelling is not Y-shaped,\r\nas in gorges where there has been indefinite time for the operation of\r\nerosive agencies. 3. Furthermore, the precipices lining the post-glacial\r\ngorge above Fort Snelling are far more abrupt than those in the\r\npreglacial valley below, and they give far less evidence of weathering.\r\n4. Still, again, the tributary streams, like the Minnehaha River, which\r\nempty into the Mississippi between Fort Snelling and Minneapolis,\r\nflow upon the surface, and have eroded gorges of very limited extent;\r\nwhereas, below Fort Snelling, the small streams have usually either found\r\nunderground access to the river or occupy gorges of indefinite extent.\r\n\r\nThe above estimates, setting such narrow limits to post-glacial time\r\nin America, will seem surprising only to those who have not carefully\r\nconsidered the glacial phenomena of various kinds to be observed all\r\nover the glaciated area. As already said, the glaciated portion of\r\nNorth America is a region of waterfalls, caused by the filling up of\r\nold channels with glacial _débris_, and the consequent diversion of the\r\nwater-courses. By this means the streams in countless places have been\r\nforced to fall over precipices, and to begin anew their work of erosion.\r\nWaterfalls abound in the glaciated region because post-glacial time is\r\nso short. Give these streams time enough, and they will wear their way\r\nback to their sources, as the preglacial streams had done over the same\r\narea, and as similar streams have done outside the glaciated region. Upon\r\nclose observation, it will be found that the waterfalls in America are\r\nnearly all post-glacial, and that their work of erosion has been confined\r\nto a very limited time. A fair example is to be seen at Elyria, Ohio,\r\nin the falls of Black River, one of the small streams which empty into\r\nLake Erie from the south. Its post-glacial gorge, worn in sandstone which\r\noverlies soft shale, is only about two thousand feet in length, and it\r\nhas as yet made no approach toward a V-shaped outlet.\r\n\r\nThe same impression of recent age is made by examining the outlets of\r\nalmost any of the lakes which dot the glaciated area. The very reason of\r\nthe continued existence of these lakes is that they have not had time\r\nenough to lower their outlets sufficiently to drain the water off, as has\r\nbeen done in all the unglaciated region. In many cases it is easy to see\r\nthat the time during which this process of lowering the outlets has been\r\ngoing on cannot have been many thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe same impression is made upon studying the evidences of post-glacial\r\nvalley erosion. Ordinary streams constantly enlarge their troughs by\r\nimpinging against the banks now upon one side and now upon the other, and\r\ntransporting the material towards the sea. It is estimated by Wallace\r\nthat nine-tenths of the sedimentary material borne along by rivers is\r\ngathered from the immediate vicinity of its current, and goes to enlarge\r\nthe trough of the stream. Upon measuring the cubical contents of many\r\neroded troughs of streams in the glaciated region, and applying the\r\ntables giving the average amount of annual transportation of sediment\r\nby streams, we arrive at nearly the same results as by the study of the\r\nrecession of post-glacial waterfalls.\r\n\r\nProfessor L. E. Hicks, of Granville, Ohio, has published the results\r\nof careful calculations made by him, concerning the valley of Raccoon\r\nCreek in Licking County, Ohio.[ED] These show that fifteen thousand\r\nyears would be more than abundant time for the erosion of the immediate\r\nvalley adjoining that small stream. I have made and published similar\r\ncalculations concerning Plum Creek, at Oberlin, in Lorain County,\r\nOhio.[EE] Like Raccoon Creek, this has its entire bed in glacial\r\ndeposits, and has had nothing else to do since its birth but to enlarge\r\nits borders. The drainage basin of the creek covers an area of about\r\ntwenty-five square miles. Its main trough averages about twenty feet in\r\ndepth by five hundred in width, along a distance of about ten miles. From\r\nthe rate at which the stream is transporting sediment, it is incredible\r\nthat it could have been at work at this process more than ten thousand\r\nyears without producing greater results.\r\n\r\n[Footnote ED: See Baptist Quarterly for July. 1884.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EE: See Ice Age in North America, p. 469.]\r\n\r\nCalculations based upon the amount of sediment deposited since the\r\nretreat of the ice-sheet point to a like moderate conclusion. When one\r\nlooks upon the turbid water of a raging stream in time of flood, and\r\nconsiders that all the sediment borne along will soon settle down upon\r\nthe bottom of the lake into which the stream empties, he can but feel\r\nsurprised that the \"wash\" of the hills has not already filled up the\r\ndepression of the lake. It certainly would have done so had the present\r\ncondition of things existed for an indefinite period of time.\r\n\r\nNaturally, while prosecuting the survey of the superficial geology of\r\nMinnesota, Mr. Upham was greatly impressed by the continued existence\r\nof the innumerable lakelets that give such a charm to the scenery of\r\nthat State. Every day's investigations added to the evidence that the\r\nlapse of time since the Ice age must have been comparatively brief,\r\nsince, otherwise, the rains and streams would have filled these basins\r\nwith sediment, and cut outlets low enough to drain them dry, for in many\r\ninstances he could see such changes slowly going forward.[EF]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EF: Minnesota Geological Report for 1879, p. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107.--Section of kettle-hole near Pomp's Pond,\r\nAndover, Massachusetts (see text). (For general view of the situation,\r\nsee Fig. 30, p. 78.)]\r\n\r\nSome years ago I myself made a careful estimate of the amount of\r\ndeposition and vegetable accumulation which had taken place in a\r\nkettle-hole near Pomp's Pond, in Andover, Mass. The diameter of the\r\ndepression at the rim was 276 feet. The inclination of the sides was\r\nsuch that the extreme depression of the apex of the inverted cone could\r\nnot have been more than seventy feet; yet the accumulation of peat and\r\nsediment only amounted to a depth of seventeen feet. The total amount of\r\nmaterial which had accumulated would be represented by a cone ninety-six\r\nfeet in diameter at the base and seventeen feet at the apex, which would\r\nequal only a deposit of about five feet over the present surface of the\r\nbottom. It is easy to see that ten thousand years is a liberal allowance\r\nof time for the accumulation of five feet of sediment in the bottom\r\nof an enclosure like a kettle-hole, for upon examination it is clear\r\nthat whatever insoluble material gets into a kettle-hole must remain\r\nthere, since there is no possible way by which it can get out. Now five\r\nfeet is sixty inches, and if this amount has been six thousand years\r\nin accumulating, that would represent a rate of an inch in one hundred\r\nyears, while, if it has been twelve thousand years in accumulation, the\r\nrate will be only one two-hundredth of an inch per year, a film so small\r\nas to be almost inappreciable. If we may judge from appearance, the\r\nresult would not be much different in the case of the tens of thousands\r\nof kettle-holes and lakelets which dot the surface of the glaciated\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1869 Dr. E. Andrews, of Chicago, made an important series of\r\ncalculations concerning the rate at which the waters of Lake Michigan are\r\neating into the shores and washing the sediment into deeper water or\r\ntowards the southern end of the lake. With reference to the erosion of\r\nthe shores, it appears from the work of the United States Coast Survey\r\nthat a shoulder, covered with sixty feet of water, representing the\r\ndepth at which wave-action is efficient in erosion, extends outward from\r\nthe west shore a distance of about three miles, where the sounding line\r\nreveals the shore of the deeper original lake as it appeared upon the\r\nfirst withdrawal of the ice.\r\n\r\nFrom a variety of observations the average rate at which the erosion of\r\nthe bluffs is proceeding is found to be such that the post-glacial time\r\ncannot be more than ten thousand years, and probably not more than seven\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nAn independent mode of calculating this period is afforded by the\r\naccumulations of sand at the south end of the lake, to which it is\r\nconstantly drifting by the currents of water propelled against the shores\r\nby the wind; for the body of water in the lake is moving southward\r\nalong the shores towards the closed end in that direction, there being\r\na returning current along the middle of the lake. All the railroads\r\napproaching Chicago from the east pass through these sand deposits, and\r\nfew of the observant travellers passing over the routes can have failed\r\nto notice the dunes into which the sand has been drifted by the wind.\r\nNow, all the material of these dunes and sand-beaches has been washed out\r\nof the bluffs to the northward by the process already mentioned, and has\r\nbeen slowly transferred by wave-action to its present position. It is\r\nestimated that south of Chicago and Grand Haven, this wave-transported\r\nsand amounts to 3,407,451,000 cubic yards. This occupies a belt curving\r\naround the south end about ten miles wide and one hundred miles long.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which the sand is moving southward along the shore is found\r\nby observing the amount annually arrested by the piers at Chicago, Grand\r\nHaven, and Michigan City. This equals 129,000 cubic yards for a year,\r\nwhich can scarcely be more than one quarter or one fifth of the total\r\namount in motion. At this rate, the sand accumulations at the southern\r\nend of the lake would have been produced in a little less than seven\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" says Dr. Andrews, \"we estimate the total annual sand-drift at\r\nonly twice the amount actually stopped by the very imperfect piers\r\nbuilt--which, in the opinion of the engineers, is setting it far too\r\nlow--and compare it with the capacity of the clay-basin of Lake Michigan,\r\nwe shall find that, had this process continued one hundred thousand years\r\nthe whole south end of Lake Michigan, up to the line connecting Chicago\r\nand Michigan City, would have been full and converted into dry land\r\ntwenty-five thousand years ago, and the coast-line would now be found\r\nmany miles north of Chicago.\"[EG]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EG: Southall's Recent Origin of Man, p. 502.]\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add a word in answer co an objection which may arise\r\nin the reader's mind, for it will doubtless occur to some to ask why\r\nthis sand which is washed out by the waves from the bluffs is not\r\ncarried inward towards the deeper portion of the trough of the lake,\r\nthus producing a waste which would partly counteract the forces of\r\naccumulation at the south end. The answer is found in the fact that the\r\nsouth end of Lake Michigan is closed, and that the currents set in motion\r\nby the wind are such that there is no off-shore motion sufficient to move\r\nsand, and, as a matter of fact, dredgings show that the sand is limited\r\nto the vicinity of the shore.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the eroded cliffs upon Michigan and the other Great Lakes\r\nwith what occurs in similar situations about the glacial Lake Agassiz, we\r\nobtain an interesting means of estimating the comparative length of time\r\noccupied by the ice-front in receding from the Canadian border to Hudson\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Lake Agassiz occupied a position quite similar in most\r\nrespects to Lake Michigan. Its longest diameter was north and south, and\r\nthe same forces which have eroded the cliffs of Lake Michigan and piled\r\nup sand-dunes at its southern end would have produced similar effects\r\nupon the shores of Lake Agassiz, had its continuance been anywhere near\r\nas long as that of the present Lake Michigan has been. But, according\r\nto Mr. Upham, who has most carefully surveyed the whole region, there\r\nare nowhere on the shores of the old Lake Agassiz any evidence of eroded\r\ncliffs at all to be compared with those found upon the present Great\r\nLakes, while there is almost an entire lack of sand deposits about the\r\nsouth end such as characterise the shore of Lake Michigan. \"The great\r\ntracts of dunes about the south end of Lake Michigan belong,\" as Upham\r\nwell observes, \"wholly to beach accumulations, being sand derived from\r\nerosion of the western and eastern shores of the lake.... But none of\r\nthe beaches of our glacial lakes are large enough to make dunes like\r\nthose on Lake Michigan, though the size and depth of Lake Agassiz, its\r\ngreat extent from north to south, and the character of its shores, seem\r\nequally favorable for their accumulation. It is thus again indicated that\r\nthe time occupied by the recession of the ice-sheet was comparatively\r\nbrief.\"[EH]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EH: Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History,\r\nvol. xxiv, p. 454; Upham's Glacial Lakes in Canada, in Bulletin of the\r\nGeological Society of America, vol. ii, p. 248.]\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Upham's conclusions it would seem that if ten thousand years\r\nbe allowed for the post-glacial existence of Lake Michigan, one tenth\r\nof that period would be more than sufficient to account for the cliffs,\r\ndeltas, beaches, and other analogous phenomena about Lake Agassiz. In\r\nother words, the duration of Lake Agassiz could not have been more\r\nthan a thousand years, which gives us a measure of the rate at which\r\nthe recession of the ice-front went on after it had withdrawn to the\r\ninternational boundary. The distance from there to the mouth of Nelson\r\nRiver is about 600 miles. The recession of the ice-front over that area\r\nproceeded, therefore, at the average rate of about half a mile per year.\r\n\r\nThere are many evidences that the main period of glaciation west of the\r\nRocky Mountains was considerably later than that in the eastern part of\r\nthe continent. A portion of the facts pointing to this conclusion have\r\nbeen well stated by Mr. George F. Becker, of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey.\r\n\r\n\"No one,\" he says, \"who has examined the glaciated regions of the\r\nSierra can doubt that the great mass of the ice disappeared at a very\r\nrecent period. The immense areas of polished surfaces fully exposed\r\nto the severe climate of say from 7,000 to 12,000 feet altitude, the\r\ninsensible erosion of streams running over glaciated rocks, and the\r\nfreshness of erratic boulders are sufficient evidence of this. There\r\nis also evidence that the glaciation began at no very distant geologic\r\ndate. As Professor Whitney pointed out, glaciation is the last important\r\ngeological phenomenon and succeeded the great lava flows. There is also\r\nmuch evidence that erosion has been trifling since the commencement of\r\nglaciation, excepting under peculiar circumstances. East of the range,\r\nfor example, at Virginia City, andesites which there is every reason to\r\nsuppose preglacial have scarcely suffered at all from erosion, so that\r\ndepressions down which water runs at every shower are not yet marked with\r\nwater-courses, while older rocks, even of Tertiary age and close by,\r\nare deeply carved. The rainfall at Virginia City is, to be sure, only\r\nabout ten inches, so that rock would erode only say one third as fast\r\nas on the California coast; but even when full allowance is made for\r\nthis difference, it is clear that these andesites must be much younger\r\nthan the commencement of glaciation in the northeastern portion of the\r\ncontinent as usually estimated. So, too, the andesites near Clear Lake,\r\nin California, though beyond a doubt preglacial, have suffered little\r\nerosion, and one of the masses, Mount Konocti (or Uncle Sam), has nearly\r\nas characteristic a volcanic form as Mount Vesuvius.\"[EI]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EI: Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, vol. ii, pp.\r\n196, 197.]\r\n\r\nThis view of Mr. Becker is amply sustained by many other obvious facts,\r\nsome of which may be easily observed by tourists who visit the Yosemite\r\nPark. The freedom of the abutting walls of this cañon from talus, as well\r\nas the freshness of the glacial scratches upon both the walls and the\r\nfloor of the tributary cañons, all indicate a lapse of centuries only,\r\nrather than of thousands of years, since their occupation by glacial ice.\r\n\r\nThe freshness of the high-level terraces surrounding the valleys of Great\r\nSalt Lake, in Utah, and of Pyramid and North Carson Lakes, in Nevada, and\r\nthe small amount of erosion which has taken place since the formation of\r\nthese terraces, point in the same direction--namely, to a very recent\r\ndate for the glaciation of the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nWe have already detailed the facts concerning the formation of these\r\nterraces and the evidence of their probable connection with the Glacial\r\nperiod. It is sufficient, therefore, here to add that, according to Mr.\r\nRussell and Mr. Gilbert (two of the most eminent members of the United\r\nStates Geological Survey, who have each published monographs minutely\r\nembodying the results of their extensive observations in this region),\r\nthe erosion of present streams in the beds which were deposited during\r\nthe enlargement of the lakes is very slight, and the modification of the\r\nshores since the formation of the high terraces has been insignificant.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Gilbert: \"The Bonneville shores are almost unmodified.\r\nIntersecting streams, it is true, have scored them and interrupted their\r\ncontinuity for brief spaces; but the beating of the rain has hardly\r\nleft a trace. The sea-cliffs still stand as they first stood, except\r\nthat frost has wrought upon their faces so as to crumble away a portion\r\nand make a low talus at the base. The embankments and beaches and bars\r\nare almost as perfect as though the lake had left them yesterday, and\r\nmany of them rival in the symmetry and perfection of their contours the\r\nmost elaborate work of the engineer. There are places where boulders of\r\nquartzite or other enduring rock still retain the smooth, glistening\r\nsurfaces which the waves scoured upon them by clashing against them the\r\nsands of the beach.\r\n\r\n\"When this preservation is compared with that of the lowest Tertiary\r\nrocks of the region--the Pliocene beds to which King has given the name\r\nHumboldt--the difference is most impressive. The Pliocene shore-lines\r\nhave disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"The deposits are so indurated as to serve for building-stone. They have\r\nbeen upturned in many places by the uplifting of mountains. Elsewhere\r\nthey have been divided by faults, and the fragments, dissevered from\r\ntheir continuation in the valley, have been carried high up on the\r\nmountain-flanks, where erosion has carved them in typical mountain\r\nforms.... The date of the Bonneville flood is the geologic yesterday,\r\nand, calling it yesterday, we may without exaggeration refer the Pliocene\r\nof Utah to the last decade; the Eocene of the Colorado basin to the last\r\ncentury, and relegate the laying of the Potsdam sandstone to prehistoric\r\ntimes.\"[EJ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EJ: Second Annual Report of the United States Geological\r\nSurvey, p. 188.]\r\n\r\nMr. Russell adds to this class of evidence that of the small extent to\r\nwhich the glacial striæ have been effaced since the withdrawal of the\r\nice from the borders of these old lakes: \"The smooth surfaces are still\r\nscored with fine, hair-like lines, and the eye fails to detect more\r\nthan a trace of disintegration that has taken place since the surfaces\r\nreceived their polish and striation.... It seems reasonable to conclude\r\nthat in a severe climate like that of the high Sierra it\" (the polish)\r\n\"could not remain unimpaired for more than a few centuries at the\r\nmost.\"[EK]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EK: See also Mr. Upham in American Journal of Science, vol.\r\nxli, pp. 41, 51.]\r\n\r\nEurope does not seem to furnish so favourable opportunities as America\r\nfor estimating the date of the Glacial period; still it is not altogether\r\nwanting in data bearing upon the subject.\r\n\r\nSome of the caves in which palæolithic implements were found associated\r\nwith the bones of extinct animals in southern England contain floors\r\nof stalagmite which have been thought by some to furnish a measure of\r\nthe time separating the deposits underneath from those above. This is\r\nspecially true in the case of Kent's Cavern, near Torquay, which contains\r\ntwo floors of stalagmite, the upper one almost continuous and varying in\r\nthickness from sixteen inches to five feet, the lower one being in places\r\ntwelve feet thick, underneath which human implements were found.\r\n\r\nBut it is difficult to determine the rate at which stalagmite\r\naccumulates. As is well known, this deposit is a form of carbonate of\r\nlime, and accumulates when water holding the substance in solution drops\r\ndown upon the surface, where it is partially evaporated. It then leaves a\r\nthin film of the substance upon the floor. The rate of the accumulation\r\nwill depend upon both the degree to which the water is saturated with the\r\ncarbonate and upon the quantity of the water which percolates through the\r\nroof of the cavern. These factors are so variable, and so dependent upon\r\nunknown conditions in the past, that it is very difficult to estimate the\r\nresult for any long period of time. Occasionally a quarter of an inch of\r\nstalagmite accretion has been known to take place in a cavern in a single\r\nyear, while in Kent's Cavern, over a visitor's name inscribed in the\r\nyear 1688, a film of stalagmite only a twentieth of an inch in thickness\r\nhas accumulated. If, therefore, we could reckon upon a uniformity of\r\nconditions stretching indefinitely back into the past, we could determine\r\nthe age of these oldest remains of man in Kent's Hole by a simple sum in\r\narithmetic, and should infer that the upper layer of stalagmite required\r\n240,000 years, and the lower 576,000 years, for their growth, which would\r\ncarry us back more than 700,000 years, and some have not hesitated to\r\naffix as early a date as this to these lowest implement-bearing gravels.\r\n\r\nBut other portions of the cave show an actual rate of accretion very much\r\nlarger. Six inches of stalagmite is there found overlying some remains of\r\nRomano-Saxon times which cannot be more than 2,000 years old. Assuming\r\nthis as the uniform rate, the total time required for the deposit of the\r\nstalagmitic floors would still be about 70,000 years. But, as we have\r\nseen, the present rates of deposition are probably considerably less than\r\nthose which took place during the moister climate of the Glacial epoch.\r\nStill, even by supposing the rate to be increased fourfold, the age of\r\nthis lower stratum would be reduced to only 12,000 years. So that, as Mr.\r\nJames Geikie well maintains, \"Even on the most extravagant assumption as\r\nto the former rate of stalagmitic accretion, we shall yet be compelled\r\nto admit a period of many thousands of years for the formation of the\r\nstalagmitic pavements in Kent's Cavern.\"[EL] We should add, however,\r\nthat there is much well-founded doubt whether the implements found\r\nin the lowest stratum were really in place, since, according to Dr.\r\nEvans, \"Owing to previous excavations and to the presence of burrowing\r\nanimals, the remains from above and below the stalagmite have become\r\nintermingled.\"[EM]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EL: Prehistoric Europe, p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EM: Stone and Flint Implements, p. 446.]\r\n\r\nAn attempt was made by M. Morlot in Switzerland to obtain the chronology\r\nof the Glacial period by studying the deltas of the streams descending\r\nthe glaciated valleys. He paid special attention to that of the Tinière,\r\na stream which flows into Lake Geneva near Villeneuve. The modern delta\r\nof this stream consists of gravel and sand deposited in the shape of a\r\nflattened cone, and investigations upon it were facilitated by a long\r\nrailroad cutting through it. \"Three layers of vegetable soil, each of\r\nwhich must at one time have formed the surface of the cone, have been\r\ncut through at different depths.\"[EN] In the upper stratum Roman tiles\r\nand a coin were found; in the second stratum, unvarnished pottery and\r\nimplements of bronze; while in the lower stratum, at a depth of nineteen\r\nfeet from the surface, a human skull was found, to which Morlot assigned\r\nan age of from 5,000 to 7,000 years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote EN: Lyell's Antiquity of Man, p. 28.]\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Andrews, after carefully revising the data, felt confident that\r\nthe time required for the whole deposit of this lower delta was not more\r\nthan 5,000 years, and that the oldest human remains in it, which were\r\nabout half way from between the base and the surface of the cone, were\r\nprobably not more than 3,000 years old.\r\n\r\nStill, the significance of this estimate principally arises from the\r\nrelation of the modern delta to older deltas connected with the Glacial\r\nperiod. Above this modern delta, formed by the river in its present\r\nproportions, there is another, more ancient, about ten times as large,\r\nwhose accumulation doubtless took place upon the final retreat of the\r\nice from Lake Geneva. No remains of man have been found in this, but it\r\ndoubtless corresponds in age with the high-level gravels in the valley\r\nof the Somme, in which the remains of man and the mammoth, together with\r\nother extinct animals, have been found.\r\n\r\nWe do not see, however, that any very definite calculation can be made\r\nconcerning the time required for its deposition. Lyell was inclined to\r\nconsider it ten times as old as the modern delta, simply upon the ground\r\nof its being ten times as large. On Morlot's estimate of the age of the\r\nmodern delta, therefore, the retreat of the ice whose melting torrents\r\ndeposited the upper delta would be fixed at 100,000 years ago, and upon\r\nDr. Andrews's calculation, at about 20,000.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident that the problem is not one of simple multiplication.\r\nThe floods of water which accompanied the melting back of the ice from\r\nthe upper portions of this valley must have been immensely larger than\r\nthose of the present streams, and their transporting power immensely\r\ngreater still. Hence we do not see that any conclusions can be drawn from\r\nthe deltas of the Tinière to give countenance to extreme views concerning\r\nthe date of the close of the Glacial period.[EO]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EO: Lyell's Antiquity of Man, p. 321.]\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Somme the chronological data relating to the Glacial\r\nperiod, and indicating a great antiquity for man, have been thought to\r\nbe more distinct than anywhere else in Europe. As already stated, it\r\nis the prevalent opinion that since man first entered the valley, in\r\nconnection with the mammoth and the other extinct animals characteristic\r\nof the Glacial period, the trough of the Somme, about a mile in width and\r\na hundred feet in depth, has been eroded by the drainage of its present\r\nvalley. An extensive accumulation of peat also has taken place along the\r\nbottom of the trough of the river since it was originally eroded to its\r\npresent level. This substance occurs all along the bottom of the valley\r\nfrom far above Amiens to the sea, and is in some places more than thirty\r\nfeet in depth. The animal and vegetable remains in it all belong to\r\nspecies now inhabiting Europe.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the peat indicates that when it was formed the land stood\r\nat a slightly higher elevation than now, for the base of the stratum is\r\nnow below the sea-level, while the peat is of fresh-water origin, and,\r\naccording to Dr. Andrews,[EP] is formed from the vegetable accumulations\r\nconnected with forest growths. When, therefore, the country was covered\r\nwith forests, as it was in prehistoric times, the accumulation must have\r\nproceeded with considerable rapidity. This inference is confirmed by the\r\noccurrence in the peat of prostrate trunks of oak, four feet in diameter,\r\nso sound that they were manufactured into furniture. The stumps of trees,\r\nespecially of the birch and alder, were also found in considerable\r\nnumber, standing erect where they grew, sometimes to a height of three\r\nfeet. Now, as Dr. Andrews well remarks, it is evident that, in order\r\nto prevent these stumps and prostrate trunks from complete decay, the\r\naccumulation of peat must have been rapid. From certain Roman remains\r\nfound six feet and more beneath the surface, he estimates that the\r\naccumulation since the Roman occupation has been as much as six inches a\r\ncentury, at which rate the whole would take place in somewhat over 5,000\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Footnote EP: American Journal of Science, October, 1868.]\r\n\r\nStill, if we accept this estimate, we have obtained but a starting-point\r\nfrom which to estimate the age of the high-level gravels in which\r\npalæolithic implements were found; for, if we accept the ordinary theory,\r\nwe must add to this the time required for the river to lower its bed from\r\neighty to a hundred feet, and to carry out to the sea the contents of\r\nits wide trough. But, as already shown, the Glacial period was, even in\r\nthe north of France, a time of great precipitation and of a considerable\r\ndegree of cold, when ice formed to a much greater extent than now upon\r\nthe surface of the Somme. The direct evidence of this consists in the\r\nboulders mingled with the high-level gravel which are of such size as to\r\nrequire floating ice for their transportation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the natural increase in the eroding power of the Somme\r\nbrought about by the increase in its volume, on account of the greater\r\nprecipitation in the Glacial age, there would also be, as Prestwich has\r\nwell shown, a great increase in rate through the action of ground-ice,\r\nwhich plays a very important part in the river erosion of arctic\r\ncountries, and in all probability did so during the Glacial period in the\r\nvalley of the Somme.\r\n\r\n\"When the water is reduced to and below 32° Fahr., although the rapid\r\nmotion may prevent freezing on the surface for a time, any pointed\r\nsurfaces at the bottom of the river, such as stones and boulders, will\r\ndetermine (as is the case with a saturated saline solution) a sort of\r\ncrystallisation, needles of ice being formed, which gradually extend from\r\nstone to stone and envelop the bodies with which they are in contact. By\r\nthis means the whole surface of a gravelly river-bed may become coated\r\nwith ice, which, on a change of temperature, or of atmospheric pressure,\r\nor on acquiring certain dimensions and buoyancy, rises to the surface,\r\nbringing with it the loose materials to which it adhered. Colonel Jackson\r\nremarks, in speaking of this bottom-ice, that 'it frequently happens that\r\nthese pieces, in rising from the bottom, bring up with them sand and\r\nstones, which are thus transported by the current.... When the thaw sets\r\nin the ice, becoming rotten, lets fall the gravel and stones in places\r\nfar distant from those whence they came.'\r\n\r\n\"Again, Baron Wrangell remarks that, 'in all the more rapid and rocky\r\nstreams of this district [northern Siberia] the formation of ice takes\r\nplace in two different manners; a thin crust spreads itself along the\r\nbanks and over the smaller bays where the current is least rapid; but the\r\ngreater part is formed in the bed of the river, in the hollows among the\r\nstones, where the weeds give it the appearance of a greenish mud. As soon\r\nas a piece of ice of this kind attains a certain size, it is detached\r\nfrom the ground and raised to the surface by the greater specific gravity\r\nof the water; these masses, containing a quantity of gravel and weeds,\r\nunite and consolidate, and in a few hours the river becomes passable\r\nin sledges instead of in boats.' Similar observations have been made\r\nin America; but instances need not be multiplied, as it is a common\r\nphenomenon in all arctic countries, and is not uncommon on a small scale\r\neven in our latitudes.\r\n\r\n\"The two causes combined--torrential river-floods and rafts of\r\nground-ice, together with the rapid wear of the river cliffs by\r\nfrost--constituted elements of destruction and erosion of which our\r\npresent rivers can give a very inadequate conception; and the excavations\r\nof the valleys must have proceeded with a rapidity with which the present\r\nrate of erosion cannot be compared; and estimates of time founded on\r\nthis, like those before mentioned on surface denudation, are therefore\r\nnot to be relied upon.\"[EQ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EQ: Prestwich's Geology, vol. ii, pp. 471, 472.]\r\n\r\nSpeaking a little later of taking the present rates of river erosion as a\r\nstandard to estimate the chronology of the Glacial period, the same high\r\nauthority remarks: \"It no more affords a true and sufficient guide than\r\nit would be to take the tottering paces and weakened force of an old man\r\nas the measure of what that individual was, and what he could do, in his\r\nrobust and active youth. It may be right to take the effects at present\r\nproduced by a given power as the known quantity, a, but it is equally\r\nindispensable, in all calculations relative to the degree of those\r\nforces in past times, to take notice of the unknown quantity, x, although\r\nthis, in the absence of actual experience, which cannot be had, can only\r\nbe estimated by the results and by a knowledge of the contemporaneous\r\nphysical conditions. It may be a complicated equation, but it is not to\r\nbe avoided.[ER]\r\n\r\n[Footnote ER: Prestwich's Geology, vol. ii, pp. 520, 521.]\r\n\r\n\"In this country and in the north of France broad valleys have been\r\nexcavated to the depth of from about eighty to a hundred and fifty feet\r\nin glacial and post-glacial times. Difficult as it is by our present\r\nexperience to conceive this to have been effected in a comparatively\r\nshort geological term, it is equally, and to my mind more, difficult to\r\nsuppose that man could have existed eighty thousand years or more, and\r\nthat existing forms of our fauna and flora should have survived during\r\ntwo hundred and forty thousand years without modification or change.\"[ES]\r\n\r\n[Footnote ES: Ibid., p. 533.]\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the age of the high-level river gravels of the Somme\r\nand other streams in northwestern Europe is not complete, however,\r\nwithout considering another possibility as to the mode of their\r\ndeposition. The conclusion to which Mr. Alfred Tylor arrived, after a\r\nprolonged and careful study of the subject, was that the main valleys of\r\nthe Somme and other streams in northern France and southern England were\r\npreglacial in their origin, and that the accumulations of gravel at high\r\nlevels along their margin were due to enormous floods which characterised\r\nthe closing portion of the great ice age, which he denominated the\r\npluvial period.[ET] The credibility of floods large enough to accomplish\r\nthe results manifest in the valley of the Somme is supported by reference\r\nto a flood which occurred on the Mulleer River, in India, in 1856, when\r\na stream, which is usually insignificant, was so swollen by a rainfall\r\nof a single day that it rose high enough to sweep away an iron bridge the\r\nbottoms of whose girders were sixty-five feet above high-water mark. One\r\niron girder weighing eighty tons was carried two miles down the river,\r\nand nearly buried in sand. The significance of these facts is enhanced\r\nby observing also that for fifteen miles above the bridge the fall of\r\nthe river only averaged ten feet per mile. Floods to this extent are\r\nnot uncommon in India. During the Glacial period spring freshets, must\r\nhave been greatly increased by the melting of a large amount of snow and\r\nice which had accumulated during the winter, and also by the formation\r\nof ice-gorges near the mouths of many of the streams. It is probable,\r\nalso, that the accumulation of ice across the northern part of the German\r\nOcean may have permanently flooded the streams entering that body of\r\nwater; for it is by no means improbable that there was a land connection\r\nbetween England and France across the Straits of Dover until after the\r\nclimax of the Glacial period. In support of his theory, Mr. Tylor points\r\nto the fact \"that the gravel in the valley of the Somme at Amiens is\r\npartly derived from _débris_ brought down by the river Somme and by the\r\ntwo rivers the Celle and the Arve, and partly consists of material from\r\nthe adjoining higher grounds washed in by land floods,\" and that the\r\n\"Quaternary gravels of the Somme are not separated into two divisions by\r\nan escarpment of chalk parallel to the river,\" but \"thin out gradually as\r\nthey slope from the high land down to the Somme.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Tylor's reasoning seems especially cogent to one who stands on the\r\nground where he can observe the size of the valley and the diminutive\r\nproportions of the present stream. Even if we do not grant all that is\r\nclaimed by Mr. Tylor, it is difficult to resist the main force of his\r\nargument, and to avoid the conclusion that the valley of the Somme is\r\nlargely the work of preglacial erosion, and has been, at any rate, only\r\nin slight degree deepened and enlarged during post-Tertiary time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote ET: Proceedings of the Geological Society, London, November 8,\r\n1867, pp. 103-126: Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, February\r\n1, 1869, pp. 57-100.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary.\r\n\r\nIn briefly summarising our conclusions concerning the question of man's\r\nantiquity as affected by his known relations to the Glacial period, it is\r\nimportant, first, to remark upon the changes of opinion which have taken\r\nplace with respect to geological time within the past generation. Under\r\nthe sway of Sir Charles Lyell's uniformitarian ideas, geologists felt\r\nthemselves at liberty to regard geological time as practically unlimited,\r\nand did not hesitate to refer the origin of life upon the globe back to\r\na period of 500,000,000 years. In the first edition of his Origin of\r\nSpecies Charles Darwin estimated that the time required for the erosion\r\nof the Wealden deposits in England was 306,662,400 years, which he spoke\r\nof as \"a mere trifle\" of that at command for establishing his theory of\r\nthe origin of species through natural selection. In his second edition,\r\nhowever, he confesses that his original statement concerning the length\r\nof geological time was rash; while in later editions he quietly omitted\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile astronomers and physicists have been gradually setting limits\r\nto geological time until they have now reached conclusions strikingly\r\nin contrast with those held by the mass of English geologists forty\r\nyears ago. Mr. George H. Darwin, Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge\r\nUniversity, has from a series of intricate calculations shown that\r\nbetween fifty and one hundred million years ago the earth was revolving\r\nfrom six to eight times faster than now, and that the moon then almost\r\ntouched the earth, and revolved about it once every three or four hours.\r\nFrom this proximity of the moon to the earth, it would result that if the\r\noceans had been then in existence the tides would have been two hundred\r\ntimes as great as now, creating a wave six hundred feet in height,\r\nwhich would sweep around the world every four hours. Such a condition\r\nof things would evidently be incompatible with geological life, and\r\ngeology must limit itself to a period which is inside of 100,000,000\r\nyears. Sir William Thomson and Professor Tait, of Great Britain, and\r\nProfessor Newcomb, of the United States Naval Observatory, approaching\r\nthe question from another point of view, seem to demonstrate that the\r\nradiation of heat from the sun is diminishing at a rate such that ten\r\nor twelve million years ago it must have been so hot upon the earth's\r\nsurface as to vaporise all the water, and thus render impossible the\r\nbeginning of geological life until later than that period. Indeed, they\r\nseem to prove by rigorous mathematical calculations that the total amount\r\nof heat originally possessed by the nebula out of which the sun has been\r\ncondensed would only be sufficient to keep up the present amount of\r\nradiation for 18,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Croll, feeling the force of these astronomical conclusions,\r\nthought it possible to add sufficiently to the sun's heat to extend its\r\nrule backwards approximately 100,000,000 years by the supposition of a\r\ncollision with it of another moving body of near its own size. Professor\r\nYoung and others have thought that possibly the heat of the sun might\r\nhave been kept up by the aid of the impact of asteroids and meteorites\r\nfor a period of 30,000,000 years. Mr. Wallace obtains similar figures by\r\nestimating the time required for the deposition of the stratified rocks\r\nopen to examination upon the land surface of the globe. As a result of\r\nhis estimates, it would appear that 28,000,000 years is all the time\r\nrequired for the formation of the geological strata. From all this it is\r\nevident that geologists are much more restricted in their speculations\r\ninvolving time than they thought themselves to be a half-century ago.\r\nTaking as our standard the medium results attained by Wallace, we shall\r\nfind it profitable to see how this time can be portioned out to the\r\ngeological periods, that we may ascertain how much approximately can be\r\nleft for the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nOn all hands it is agreed that the geological periods decrease in length\r\nas they approach the present time. According to Dana's estimates,[EU]\r\nthe \"ratio for the Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic periods would be\r\n12:3:1\"--that is, Cenozoic time is but one sixteenth of the whole.\r\nThis embraces the whole of the Tertiary period, during which placental\r\nmammals have been in existence, together with the post-Tertiary or\r\nGlacial period, extending down to the present time; that is, the time\r\nsince the beginning of the Tertiary period and the existence of the\r\nhigher animals is considerably less than two million years, even upon Mr.\r\nWallace's basis of calculation. But if we should be compelled to accept\r\nthe calculations of Sir William Thomson, Professor Tait, and Professor\r\nNewcomb, the Cenozoic period would be reduced to considerably less than\r\none million years. It is difficult to tell how much of Cenozoic time is\r\nto be assigned to the Glacial period, since there is, in fact, no sharply\r\ndrawn line between the two periods. The climax of the Glacial period\r\nrepresented a condition of things slowly attained by the changes of level\r\nwhich took place during the latter part of the Tertiary epoch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote EU: See revised edition of his Geology, p. 586.]\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate the degree of credibility with which we may at\r\nthe outset regard the theory of Mr. Prestwich and others, that all the\r\nphenomena of the Glacial period can be brought within the limits of\r\nthirty or forty thousand years, it is important to fix our minds upon\r\nthe significance of the large numbers with which we are accustomed to\r\nmultiply and divide geological quantities.[EV]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EV: See Croll's Climate and Time, chap. xx.]\r\n\r\nFew people realise either the rapidity with which geological changes\r\nare now proceeding or the small amount of change which might produce a\r\nGlacial period, and fewer still have an adequate conception of how long a\r\nperiod a million years is, and how much present geological agencies would\r\naccomplish in that time. At the present rate at which erosive agencies\r\nare now acting upon the Alps, their dimensions would be reduced one half\r\nin a million years. At the present rate of the recession of the Falls of\r\nSt. Anthony, the whole gorge from St. Louis to Minneapolis would have\r\nbeen produced in a million years. A river lowering its bed a foot in a\r\nthousand years would produce a cañon a thousand feet deep in a million\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the Glacial period to have been brought about by an\r\nelevation of land in northern America and northern Europe, proceeding at\r\nthe rate of three feet a century, which is that now taking place in some\r\nportions of Scandinavia, this would amount to three thousand feet in one\r\nhundred thousand years, and that is probably all, and even more than all,\r\nwhich is needed. One hundred thousand years, therefore, or even less,\r\nmight easily include both the slow coming on of the Glacial period and\r\nits rapid close. Prestwich estimates that the ice now floating away from\r\nGreenland as icebergs is sufficient if accumulating on a land-surface\r\nto extend the borders of a continental glacier about four hundred and\r\nfifty feet a year, or one mile in twelve years, one hundred miles in\r\ntwelve hundred years, and seven hundred miles (about the limit of glacial\r\ntransportation in America) in less than ten thousand years.\r\n\r\nAfter making all reasonable allowances, therefore, Prestwich's conclusion\r\nthat twenty-five thousand years is ample time to allow to the reign\r\nof the ice of the Glacial period cannot be regarded as by any means\r\nincredible or, on _a priori_ grounds, improbable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERTIARY MAN.\r\n\r\nBy Professor Henry W. Haynes.\r\n\r\n\"It must not be imagined that it is in any way proved that the\r\nPalæolithic man was the first human being that existed. We must be\r\nprepared to wait, however, for further and better authenticated\r\ndiscoveries before carrying his existence back in time further than\r\nthe Pleistocene or post-Tertiary period.\"[EW] This was the position\r\nassumed more than twelve years ago by the eminent English geologist\r\nand archæologist, Dr. John Evans, and it was still maintained in his\r\naddress before the Anthropological Section of the British Association on\r\nSeptember 18, 1890. I believe that the study of all the evidence in favor\r\nof the existence of the Tertiary man that has been brought forward down\r\nto the present time will leave the question in precisely the same state\r\nof uncertainty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote EW: _A Few Words on Tertiary Man_, Trans, of Hertfordshire Nat.\r\nHist. Soc, vol. i, p. 150.]\r\n\r\n\"In order to establish the existence of man at such a remote period the\r\nproofs must be convincing. It must be shown, first, that the objects\r\nfound are of human workmanship; secondly, that they are really found as\r\nstated; and, thirdly, the age of the beds in which they are found must be\r\nclearly ascertained and determined.\"[EX] These tests I propose to apply\r\nto the evidence for the Tertiary man recently brought forward in Europe,\r\nand then to consider the significance of certain discoveries on the\r\nPacific coast of our own continent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote EX: Ibid., p. 148.]\r\n\r\nTertiary deposits in Europe are alleged to have supplied three sorts of\r\nevidence of this fact: _First_, the bones of man himself; _second_, bones\r\nof animals showing incisions or fractures supposed to have been produced\r\nby human agency; _third_, chipped flints believed to exhibit marks of\r\ndesign in their production.\r\n\r\nA very complete survey of the question of the antiquity of man was\r\npublished in 1883 by M. Gabriel de Mortillet, one of its most eminent\r\ninvestigators, under the title of Le Préhistorique. In that work he\r\nsubjected to a most rigid examination all the evidence for Tertiary man,\r\ncoming under either of these three heads, that had been brought forward\r\nup to that date.\r\n\r\nThe instances of the discovery of human bones in Europe were two--at\r\nColle del Vento, in Savona, and Castenedolo, near Brescia, both in Italy.\r\nAt the former site, in a Pliocene marine deposit abounding in fossil\r\noysters and containing some _scattered_ bones of fossil mammals, a human\r\nskeleton was found _with the bones lying in their natural connection_.\r\nMortillet, however, and many others regard this as an instance of a\r\nsubsequent interment rather than as proof that the man lived in Pliocene\r\ntimes.[EY] At Castenedolo, in a similar marine Pliocene formation, on\r\nthree different occasions human skeletons have been discovered, but\r\nin different strata. One investigator has accounted for these as the\r\nresult of a shipwreck in the Pliocene period. This bold hypothesis not\r\nonly requires that man should have been sufficiently advanced at that\r\nvery remote period to have navigated the sea, but it calls for two\r\nshipwrecks, at different times, at the same point. It has, however, since\r\nbeen abandoned by its author in favor of the presumption of subsequent\r\ninterments, as in the previous instance.[EZ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EY: This is also the opinion of Hamy, _Précis de Paléontologie\r\nHumaine_, p. 67. Professor Le Conte, _Elements of Geology_ (third\r\nedition, 1891), p. 609, is wrong in attributing the opposite conclusion\r\nto Hamy, on the evidence of \"flint implements found in this locality.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote EZ: Bullettino di Paletnologia Italiana, tome xv, p. 109\r\n(August 18, 1889).]\r\n\r\nAnimal bones showing cuts or breaks supposed to be the work of man have\r\nbeen found in seventeen different localities in Europe. They can all,\r\nhowever, be accounted for as the result of natural movements or pressure\r\nof the soil acting in connection with sharp substances, like fractured\r\nflints, or else as having been made by the teeth of sharks, whose fossil\r\nremains are found in great abundance in the same formation.\r\n\r\nAll the discoveries of flints supposed to show traces of intentional\r\nchipping are pronounced to be unsatisfactory, with the exception of\r\nthose found in three localities--Thenay (near Tours) and Puy-Courny\r\n(near Aurillac), in France, and Otta, in the valley of the Tagus, in\r\nPortugal. As European archæologists at the present time are substantially\r\nin accord with Mortillet in restricting the discussion to these three\r\nplaces, I will follow their example. But although Mortillet believes\r\nthat flints found at all these localities exhibit marks of intelligent\r\naction, he will not admit that they are the work of man. He attributes\r\nthem to an intelligent ancestor of man, whom he calls by the name\r\nof anthropopithecus, or the precursor of man. Of this creature he\r\ndistinguishes three different species, named respectively after the\r\ndiscoverers of the flints in the three localities just mentioned. The\r\nprecursor, however, has found up to this time only a very limited\r\nacceptance among men of science, although a few believe in him on purely\r\ntheoretical grounds. The discussion generally turns upon the question\r\nwhether these flints were chipped intentionally or are the result of\r\nnatural causes; and also upon the determination of the geological age of\r\nthe formations in which they are found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108.--Flint flakes collected by Abbé Bourgeois from\r\nMiocene strata at Thenay (after Gaudry). Natural size.]\r\n\r\nI visited Thenay, the most celebrated of these three localities, in 1877,\r\nand had the advantage of studying the question there under the guidance\r\nof the late Abbé Bourgeois, the discoverer of the flints, and one of the\r\nmost prominent advocates of the Tertiary man. This was the year before\r\nhe died, and he showed me at the time his complete collection, and gave\r\nme several of the objects he had discovered. Geologists are agreed in\r\nassigning the deposits in which they occur to the lower Miocene or middle\r\nTertiary period, which restricts the discussion to the character of the\r\nflints themselves. The accompanying woodcut[FA] gives some indication\r\nof their appearance, although it is misleading, because the long figure\r\nresembling a flint knife is intended to represent a solid nucleus. None\r\nof these objects, however, ought to be called \"flints flakes,\" as very\r\nfew, if any, flakes showing the \"bulb of percussion,\" always seen upon\r\nthem, have been discovered in the Tertiary deposits at Thenay,[FB]\r\nalthough I have found them there myself _upon the surface_. The three\r\nother figures would be classed by archæologists as \"piercers,\" as\r\nBourgeois has himself designated them, and are also solid objects. Many\r\nof the Thenay flints exhibit a \"crackled\" appearance, due to the action\r\nof heat. On this account Mortillet maintains that they were splintered\r\nby fire, and not formed by percussion, the usual method by which flint\r\nimplements were fabricated in the stone age. The Thenay objects are\r\nall of very small dimensions, and are so absolutely unlike the large,\r\nrudely-chipped axes of the Chellean type, found in so many different\r\nparts of the world, and generally accepted as the implement used by\r\nPalæolithic man, that the question naturally suggests itself, What could\r\nhave been the purpose for which these little implements were employed? No\r\nbetter answer has been suggested than the ludicrous one that they were\r\nused by the hairy anthropopithecus to rid himself of the vermin with\r\nwhich he was infested.\r\n\r\n[Footnote FA: From Le Conte, _op. cit._, p. 608. The figures are copied\r\nfrom Gaudry, who borrowed them from the article by Bourgeois, _Congrès\r\nInternat. de Bruxelles_, 1872, p. 89, pl. ii; and from his _La Question\r\nde l'Homme Tertiare_. Revue des Questions Scientifiques, 1877, p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote FB: Le Préhistorique, p. 91.]\r\n\r\nBut, leaving aside the question of their purpose, let us consider\r\nthe evidence presented by the flints themselves. Do they exhibit the\r\nunmistakable traces of intentional chipping produced by a series of\r\nslight blows or thrusts, delivered in regular succession and in the\r\nsame direction, with the result of forming a distinctly marked edge?\r\nAnd does the appearance of the action of fire upon their surface imply\r\nthe intervention of intelligence? To both questions M. Adrien Arcelin,\r\nthe well-known geologist of Mâcon, has given very sufficient replies in\r\nthe negative. He has discovered numerous objects of precisely similar\r\nappearance in Eocene deposits in the neighborhood of Mâcon.[FC] But,\r\ninstead of pushing man back on this account so much further into the\r\npast, he accounts for the marks of chipping to be seen on many of these\r\nobjects as the result of the accidental shocks of one stone against\r\nanother in the countless overturnings and movements to which the\r\nstrata have been subjected during the long ages of geological time. He\r\ngives photographs of some of these objects, which are to me entirely\r\nconvincing, and describes how he has surprised Nature in the very act of\r\nfabricating them in an abandoned quarry worked in an Eocene deposit. He\r\nthinks the \"crackled\" surfaces can be readily explained as the result\r\nof atmospheric action, or of hot springs charged with silex. Numerous\r\nexamples of similar changes in the surface of flint, that have been\r\nnoticed by himself and others in different localities, are instanced.\r\nEven if some have been caused by fire, this does not necessarily imply\r\nthe intervention of man to have produced it. Similar discoveries have\r\nalso been made by M. d'Ault de Mesnil, at Thenay, in Eocene deposits,[FD]\r\nand by M. Paul Cabanne, in the Gironde.[FE] My own opinion, based\r\nupon the experience of many years spent in the study of flints broken\r\nnaturally as well as artificially, and upon a careful examination of\r\nBourgeois's collections, is that the so-called Thenay flints are the\r\nresult of natural causes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote FC: Matériaux pour l'Histoire Prim, et Nat. de l'Homme, tome\r\nxix, p. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote FD: Matériaux, ibid., p. 246.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote FE: Id., tome xxii, p. 205.]\r\n\r\nThe second locality where flints alleged to display marks of human action\r\nhave been found is the vicinity of Aurillac, in the Auvergne, especially\r\non the flanks of a hill called Puy-Courny. They occur in a conglomerate\r\nof the upper Miocene period, and are consequently much later than the\r\nThenay flints. In this conglomerate, in 1869, M. Tardy discovered a\r\nworked flint flake which has every appearance of being artificial.[FF]\r\nMortillet, however, says that it was found in the upper surface of the\r\ndeposit, where there may easily have been a mingling with the Quaternary\r\nformation; and it certainly resembles worked flakes, which are not\r\nuncommon in the Quaternary. The geological determination of the find may\r\nconsequently be regarded as uncertain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote FF: See Matériaux, tome vi, p. 94. S. Reinach, however,\r\n_Description Raison. du Musée de Saint-Germain-en-Laye_, i, p. 107, n. 8,\r\ncalls it \"gravure inexacte.\"]\r\n\r\nThe flints discovered at Puy-Courny by M. Barnes are of small dimensions,\r\nand have all been produced by percussion. Many of them are said to\r\nbear some resemblance to pointed flakes of artificial origin, and\r\none has been figured, probably selected for its excellence.[FG] It is\r\nby no means convincing to me, and I am not at all surprised that so\r\nmany archæologists question the artificial character of these objects,\r\nwhich exhibit a great variety of forms. Upon this point Rames does\r\nnot profess to be qualified to pronounce judgment, limiting himself\r\nsolely to the geological questions. He argues, however, that the fact\r\nthat all the objects supposed to be artificial are made of the best\r\nqualities of flint, of which implements are ordinarily made, although\r\nfragments of inferior quality are abundant in the same formation,\r\nimplies the intervention of man's judgment in making the selection.\r\nBut M. Boule shows that this is merely the result of the erosion of an\r\nancient river, which operated only upon the upper beds, in which alone\r\nthe better qualities of flint are to be found; and Rames has accepted\r\nthis explanation.[FH] The flints of Puy-Courny seem to fall within the\r\nsame category as those of Thenay. They are the product of denudation,\r\nhave travelled long distances, and have been subjected to the action of\r\npowerful agents. These causes are sufficient to account for the shocks of\r\nwhich they show the traces, and to explain the production of splinters\r\narising therefrom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote FG: Matériaux, tome xviii, p. 400.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote FH: Revue d'Anthropologie (third series), tome iv, p. 217.]\r\n\r\nThe last locality in which flints claimed to have been manufactured by\r\nthe Tertiary man are supposed to have been discovered is the so-called\r\ndesert of Otta, in the valley of the Tagus, not far from Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe formation there is a lacustrine deposit of great thickness, belonging\r\nto the upper Miocene, and abounding in flint. Here, during the course of\r\ntwenty years, M. Ribeiro discovered, but mostly upon the surface, a large\r\nnumber of flakes of flint and quartzite. After much debate in regard to\r\nthem, ninety-five of them were finally sent by him to Paris, in 1878, and\r\nplaced in the archæological department of the great exposition. There\r\nthey were to be submitted to the judgment of the assembled prehistoric\r\narchæologists of all nationalities, many of whom, including the writer,\r\navailed themselves of the opportunity of carefully studying them. The\r\njudgment of Mortillet is that twenty-two specimens exhibited unmistakable\r\ntraces of intentional chipping, in which opinion I entirely concur.\r\nOnly nine, however, were represented as coming from the Miocene, some\r\nof which showed on their surface an incrustation of grit, which was\r\nclaimed as proof of their origin. But the opinion was freely expressed\r\nthat, even if they really came from the Miocene deposits, they might\r\nhave penetrated into them from the surface, through cracks, and thus\r\nhave become so incrusted. It was accordingly resolved to hold the next\r\ninternational congress of prehistoric archæologists at Lisbon, in 1880,\r\nmainly for the purpose of settling this question, if possible, by an\r\ninvestigation conducted upon the spot. In the course of a visit made at\r\nthat time to Otta, several artificial specimens were found on the surface\r\nby different searchers, but Professor Bellucci, of Perugia, was fortunate\r\nenough to discover a flint flake _in situ_, still so closely imbedded\r\nin the deposit that it required to be detached by a hammer. There is no\r\nquestion that this object was actually found in a Miocene deposit, but\r\nunfortunately it belongs to the doubtful category of external flakes,\r\nwhich, although they exhibit the \"bulb of percussion,\" have no other\r\nsure indication that they are the work of man.[FI] As such bulbs can\r\nbe produced by natural causes, some stronger proof than this of the\r\nexistence of Tertiary man is demanded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote FI: It has been figured by Bellucci, _Archivio per\r\nl'Anthropologia e la Etnologia di Firenze_, tome xi, p. 12, tav. iv, fig.\r\n2. To me it possesses no value as evidence.]\r\n\r\nThese are all the localities in Europe claimed by Mortillet to have\r\nfurnished such evidence, but he thinks a strong confirmation of it\r\nis afforded by certain discoveries made in the auriferous gravels of\r\nCalifornia. I will not occupy space here in repeating arguments I have\r\nbrought forward elsewhere to show the utter insufficiency of this\r\nevidence to prove the existence of man on the Pacific coast of our\r\ncontinent during the Pliocene period,[FJ] They may all be summed up in\r\nthe words of Le Conte: \"The doubts in regard to this extreme antiquity\r\nof man are of three kinds, viz.: 1. Doubts as to the Pliocene age of the\r\ngravels--they may be early Quaternary. 2. Doubts as to the authenticity\r\nof the finds--no scientist having seen any of them in situ. 3. Doubts\r\nas to the undisturbed conditions of the gravels, for auriferous gravels\r\nare especially liable to disturbance. The character of the implements\r\nsaid to have been found gives peculiar emphasis to this last doubt, _for\r\nthey are not Paleolithic_, but Neolithic.\"[FK] The question has been\r\nraised whether this archæological objection is applicable to the stone\r\nmortars, numerous examples of which have been found in the gravels, some\r\nof them quite recently.[FL] If the evidence brought forward by Professor\r\nWhitney and others were limited to these mortars, it might very well\r\nbe claimed that they are neither Palæolithic nor Neolithic; that the\r\nsmoothness of their surface is owing to their having been hollowed out of\r\npebbles that have been polished and worn by natural forces. But Professor\r\nWhitney has cited numberless instances of \"spear-heads,\" \"arrow-heads,\"\r\n\"discoidal stones,\" \"stone beads,\" and \"a hatchet\" that have been found\r\nunder precisely similar conditions as the mortars. So Mr. Becker has\r\nrecently produced an affidavit of a certain Mr. Neale that in a tunnel\r\nrun into the gravel in 1877 \"between two hundred and three hundred feet\r\nbeyond the edge of the solid lava, he saw several spear-heads nearly\r\none foot in length.\"[FM] Now it cannot be questioned that such objects\r\nas these clearly belong to the Neolithic period, which does not imply\r\nthat all the objects used at that time were polished, but that together\r\nwith chipped implements \"polished stone implements were also used.\"[FN]\r\nNo archæologist will believe that, while Palæolithic man has not yet\r\nbeen discovered in the Tertiary deposits of western Europe, the works of\r\nNeolithic man have been found in similar deposits in western America.\r\nPeculiar difficulties seem to surround the evidence brought forward\r\nin support of such an assumption. We are told by Professor Whitney\r\nthat a stone mortar was \"found standing upright, and the pestle was\r\nin it, in its proper place, just as it had been left by the owner.\"\r\nHe fails, however, to explain how this was brought about in a gravel\r\ndeposit supposed to have been laid down by great floods of water. So,\r\nwhen Mr. Neale swears that he saw fifteen years ago in the same gravels\r\nspear-heads a great deal larger than those known to archæologists, may\r\nwe not ask whether reliance can be placed on the memory of witnesses who\r\ntestify to impossibilities to justify conclusions that rest upon such\r\ntestimony? I think we shall have to wait for further and better evidence\r\nthan this before we are called upon to admit that the existence of the\r\nTertiary man upon our Pacific coast has been established.\r\n\r\n[Footnote FJ: _The Prehistoric Archæology of North America_, Narrative\r\nand Critical History of America, vol. i, pp. 850-356.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote FK: Le Conte, _op. cit._, p. 614.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote FL: Professor George Frederick Wright, _Prehistoric Man on the\r\nPacific Coast_, Atlantic Monthly, April, 1891, p. 512; _Table Mountain\r\nArchæology_, Nation, May 21, 1891, p. 419.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote FM: _Antiquities from under Tuolome Table Mountain in\r\nCalifornia_, Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, vol. ii, p.\r\n192.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote FN: Le Conte, _op. cit._, p. 607.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aar Glacier, 11, 43, 132.\r\n  Abbeville, France, 251, 263.\r\n  Abbott, C.

By Garrett P.\r\nServiss. 8vo. Cloth, $1.50.\r\n\r\nThis is a unique book, quite alone in the field that it occupies. The\r\ncall for a fourth edition within two years after its first publication\r\nattests its popularity. As one of its reviewers has said, \"It is the most\r\nhuman book on the subject of the stars.\" It would have supplied Thomas\r\nCarlyle's want when he wrote, \"Why did not somebody teach me the stars\r\nand make me at home in the starry heavens?\" Interest in the geography of\r\nthe heavens is increasing every year, as the discoveries of astronomers\r\nwith the giant telescopes of our day push back the limits of the known\r\nuniverse, and this book is to those who read of such discoveries like an\r\natlas to the student of history.\r\n\r\nSome of the compliments that the book has received are these:\r\n\r\n  \"A most interesting and even fascinating book.\"--_Christian Union_.\r\n\r\n  \"The glimpses he allows to be seen of far-stretching vistas opening\r\n  out on every side of his modest course of observation help to fix the\r\n  attention of the negligent, and lighten the toil of the painstaking\r\n  student.... Mr. Serviss writes with freshness and vivacity.\"--_London\r\n  Saturday Review_.\r\n\r\n  \"We are glad to welcome this, the second edition, of a popular\r\n  introduction to the study of the heavens.... There could hardly be a more\r\n  pleasant road to astronomical knowledge than it affords.... A child may\r\n  understand the text, which reads more like a collection of anecdotes than\r\n  anything else, but this does not mar its scientific value.\"--_Nature_.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Garrett P. Serviss's book, 'Astronomy with an Opera-Glass,' offers\r\n  us an admirable hand-book and guide in the cultivation of this noble\r\n  æsthetic discipline (the study of the stars).\"--_New York Home Journal_.\r\n\r\n  \"The book should belong to every family library.\"--_Boston Home Journal_.\r\n\r\n  \"This book ought to make star-gazing popular.\"--_New York Herald_.\r\n\r\n  \"The author attributes much of the indifference of otherwise\r\n  well-informed persons regarding the wonders of the starry firmament to\r\n  the fact that telescopes are available to few, and that most people have\r\n  no idea of the possibilities of the more familiar instrument of almost\r\n  daily use whose powers he sets forth.\"--New Orleans Times-Democrat.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"By its aid thousands of people who have resigned themselves to the\r\n  ignorance in which they were left at school, by our wretched system of\r\n  teaching by the book only, will thank Mr. Serviss for the suggestions he\r\n  has so well carried out.\"--_New York Times_.\r\n\r\n  \"For amateur use this book is easily the best treatise on astronomy yet\r\n  published.\"--Chicago Herald.\r\n\r\n  \"'Astronomy with an Opera-Glass' fills a long-felt want.\"--_Albany\r\n    Journal_.\r\n\r\n  \"No intelligent reader of this book but will feel that if the author\r\n  fails to set his public star-gazing the fault is not his, for his style\r\n  is as winning, as graphic, and as clear as the delightful type in which\r\n  it is printed.\"--_Providence Journal_.\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Serviss neither talks over the heads of his readers nor ignores\r\n  the sublime complexity and range of his themes, but unites simplicity\r\n  with scholarship, scientific precision with life-long enthusiasm, and a\r\n  genuine eloquence with rare touches of humor. Considered as a product\r\n  of the publishing industry, the book is elegance itself.\"--_The\r\n  Chautauquan_.\r\n\r\nNew York: D.

Summer and winter,\r\n  morning, and evening, he has been in the open air all the time on the\r\n  alert for some new revelation of instinct, or feeling, or character\r\n  on the part of his neighbor creatures. Most that he sees and hears he\r\n  reports agreeably to us, as it was no doubt delightful to himself. Books\r\n  like this, which are free from all the technicalities of science, but yet\r\n  lack little that has scientific value, are well suited to the reading of\r\n  the young.
